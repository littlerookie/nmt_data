I'm sorry, Reg.
Oh, it's all right. He's sorry.

you stupid, birdbrained, flatheaded
my legs are old and bent.
my ears are grizzled. Yes?
there's one place we didn't look. Guards!
I'm just a poor old man.
my nose is knackered.
have you ever seen anyone crucified?
Crucifixion's a doddle.
don't keep saying that.
found this spoon, sir.
well done, sergeant.
we'll be back, oddball.
open up!
you haven't given us time to hide.
in that time, the serpent, he shall strike you
holes from every bitch you got germs from Jumbo jets
don't pass judgement on other people...
or you might get judged yourself.
what? I said, don't pass judgement on other people...
or else you might get judged too.
who, me? Yes.
thank you very much. Not just you. All of you.
that's a nice gourd. What?
how much do you want for the gourd? You can have it.
have it? Yes. Consider the lilies.
don't you want to haggle? No. In the field.
what's wrong with it? Nothing. Take it.
consider the lilies? Well, the birds, then.
what birds? Any birds.
Why? Well, have they got jobs?
who? The birds.
have the birds got jobs?
what's the matter with him? Says the birds are scrounging.
the point is, the birds, they do all right, don't they?
well, good luck to 'em. Yeah, they're very pretty.
okay. And you're much more important than they are, right?
so what are you worrying about? There you are. See?
I'm worrying about what you've got against birds.
I haven't got anything against the birds.
consider the lilies. He's having a go at the flowers now!
give the flowers a chance. I'll give you one for it.
it's yours. Two, then.
look, there was this man, and he had two servants.
what were they called? What were their names?
I don't know. And he gave them some talents.
you don't know? Well, it doesn't matter.
he doesn't know what they were called!
they were called Simon and Adrian. You said you didn't know!
it really doesn't matter. The point is, there were these two servants.
he's making it up as he goes along. No, I'm not!
and he gave them Wait, were there three?
Oh, he's terrible.
there were two or three. Oh, get off!
now hear this! Blessed are they...
three. Who convert their neighbor's asses.
for they shall inhibit their girth. Rubbish!
and to them only shall be given to them only shall be given
what? Hmm?
shall be given what? Oh, nothing.
what were you going to say? Nothing.
Yes, you were going to say something. No, I finished.
tell us before you go. I'm finished.
no, you don't. Why won't he tell?
won't say! It ain't a secret, is it?
must be, otherwise he'd tell us. Tell us.
leave me alone. What is the secret?
is it the secret of eternal life? He won't say.
if I knew the secret of eternal life, I wouldn't say.
leave me alone! Just tell me, please.
we were here first.
go away! Tell us, master.
is that his gourd? Yeah, but it's under offer.
this is his gourd.
ten! It is his gourd!
we will carry it for you, master.
master? He's gone!
he's been taken up.
he's been taken up!
nineteen! No, there he is. Over there.
look! Oh! Oh!
he has given us a sign.
he has given us his shoe!
the shoe is the sign. Let us follow his example.
what? Let us, like him, hold up one shoe!
for this is his sign that all who follow him shall do likewise!
Yes! No, no. The shoe is a sign...
that we must gather shoes together in abundance.
cast off the shoes. Follow the gourd!
no, let us gather shoes together! Let me!
no, it is a sign that, like him, we must think not of the things of the body...
but of the face and head.
give me your shoe! Get off!
follow the gourd, the Holy Gourd of Jerusalem!
the gourd! Hold up the sandal, as he has commanded us.
it is a shoe! It's a sandal!
no, it isn't! Cast it away!
put it on! Clear off!
take the shoes and follow him!
come back! Stop!
let us, let us pray.
yea, he cometh to us...
like the seeds of the grain.
master! Master!
Hey! Is there another way down?
is there another path down to the river?
please, please help me. I've got to get
Oh, my foot! Oh
Shhh. Oh, damn, damn, damn!
I'm sorry. Oh, damn, damn it! Blast it!
I'm sorry. Shhh. Don't you "shhh" me.
eighteen years of total silence, and you "shhh" me!
what? I've kept my vow for 18 years...
not a single, recognizable, articulate sound has passed my lips.
could you be quiet for another five minutes?
it doesn't matter now. I might as well enjoy myself.
for the last 18 years, I've wanted to shout and sing and scream my name out!
Shhh. Shhh. Oh, I'm alive!
hava nagila, hava nagila
hava nagila
Oh, I'm alive! I'm alive! Hello, birds. Hello, trees.
I'm alive! I'm alive!
hava nagila Hava n'ra, n'ra
master! Master! Master!
master! The master! He is here!
his shoe led us to him!
speak! Speak to us, master. Speak to us!
go away!
a blessing! A blessing!
how shall we go away, master?
Oh, just go away and leave me alone!
give us a sign!
he has given us a sign! He has brought us to this place!
I didn't bring you here. You just followed me.
Oh, it's still a good sign by any standard.
master, your people have walked many miles to be with you!
they are weary and have not eaten.
it's not my fault they haven't eaten.
there is no food in this high mountain!
what about the juniper bushes over there?
a miracle! A miracle!
he has made the bush fruitful by his words!
they've brought forth juniper berries.
of course! They're juniper bushes! What do you expect!
show us another miracle.
do not tempt him, shallow ones!
is not the miracle of the juniper bushes enough?
I say, those are my juniper bushes!
they are a gift from God. They're all I've got to eat.
I say, get off those bushes. Go on. Clear off.
Lord, I am affected by a bald patch.
I'm healed! The master has healed me!
I didn't touch him!
I was blind, and now I can see!
a miracle! A miracle!
tell them to stop it.
I hadn't said a word for 18 years till he came along.
a miracle! He is the Messiah!
he hurt my foot!
hurt my foot! Hurt mine!
hail Messiah! I'm not the Messiah.
I say you are, Lord, and I should know. I've followed a few.
hail Messiah!
I'm not the Messiah! Will you please listen?
I'm not the Messiah! Do you understand? Honestly!
only the true Messiah denies his divinity.
what? Well, what sort of chance does that give me?
all right, I am the Messiah!
he is! He is the Messiah!
now, fuck off!
how shall we fuck off, O Lord?
just leave me alone!
you told these people to eat my juniper berries!
you break my bloody foot, you break my vow of silence...
and then you try to clean up on my juniper bushes!
lay off! This is the Messiah, the Chosen One!
no, he's not. An unbeliever!
an unbeliever! Persecute. Kill the heretic!
seize him! Leave him alone!
leave him alone!
leave him alone.
let him go! Please!
Brian? Judith?
Cockadoodledoo!
look! There he is! The Chosen One has woken!
Brian!
Brian! Hang on, Mother!
Shhh.
Hello, Mother. Don't you "Hello, Mother" me!
what are all those people doing out there?
well, I come on. What have you been up to?
I think they must have popped by for something.
popped by? Swarmed by, more like.
there's a multitude out there!
they started following me yesterday.
well, they can stop following you right now.
now, stop following my son!
you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
the Messiah! The Messiah! Show us the Messiah!
the who? The Messiah!
there's no messiah in here.
there's a mess, all right, but no messiah. Now, go away.
Brian! Brian!
right, my lad. What have you been up to?
nothing, Mum. Come on, out with it.
well, they think I'm the Messiah, Mum.
what have you been telling them?
nothing. I only. You're only making it worse for yourself.
I can explain. Let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!
your son is a born leader.
those people out there are following him because they believe in him.
they believe he can give them hope, hope of a new life, a new world, a better future!
who's that?
that's Judith, Mum. Judith, Mother.
hmm. Aaah!
Ohhh! Messiah! Messiah! Messiah!
Messiah! Show us the Messiah!
now, you listen here. He's not the Messiah!
he's a very naughty boy. Now, go away!
who are you? I'm his mother, that's who.
behold his mother! Behold his mother!
hail to thee, mother of Brian!
blessed art thou! Hosanna!
all praise to thee, now and always!
well, now don't think you can get around me like that.
he's not coming out, and that's my final word.
now, shove off! No!
did you hear what I said? Yes!
Oh, I see. It's like that, is it?
Yes! Oh, all right, then.
you can see him for one minute, but not one second more!
do you understand? Yes.
promise? Well... all right.
all right, here he is, then. Come on, Brian. Come and talk.
but, Mum, Judith. Oh, leave that Welsh tart alone.
I don't really want to.
Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian!
good morning. A blessing! A blessing!
no, no. Please. Please, please listen.
I've got one or two things to say.
tell us! Tell us both of them!
look, you've got it all wrong.
you don't need to follow me.
you don't need to follow anybody.
you've got to think for yourselves.
you're all individuals.
Yes, we're all individuals!
you're all different.
Yes, we're all different!
I'm not. Shhh.
you've all got to work it out for yourselves.
Yes, we've got to work it out for ourselves!
exactly.
tell us more!
No! That's the point! Don't let anyone tell you what to do!
otherwise Ow!
that's enough. That's enough.
Ooh, that wasn't a minute!
Oh, yes it was! Oh, no it wasn't!
now, stop that! And go away!
excuse me? Yes?
are you a virgin? I beg your pardon!
well, if it's not a personal question, are you a virgin?
if it's not a personal question?
how much more personal can you get?
now, piss off!
she is. Yeah, definitely.
morning, Savior.
lay your hands on me, quick!
now, don't jostle the Chosen One, please.
don't push that baby in the Savior's face.
I say, could you just see my wife?
you'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
we've got a luncheon appointment.
the lepers are queuing.
my brother-on-law is the exmayor of Gath!
Brian, can I introduce the gentleman who's letting us have the Mounts on Sunday?
don't push! And keep the noise down!
those possessed by devils, try and keep them under control.
incurables, you'll just have to wait for a few minutes.
um, women taken in sin, line up against that wall, will you?
Brian? Brian, you were fantastic.
you weren't so bad yourself.
no. What you said just now. It was quite extraordinary.
what? All that, was it?
we don't any leaders. You're so right.
reg has been dominating us for too long. Well, yes.
it needed saying, and you said it, Brian. You're very attractive.
it's our revolution. We can all do it together.
I think. I think We're all behind you, Brian.
the revolution is in your hands! What?
no, that's not what I meant at all!
you're fuckin' nicked, me old beauty.
right.
stop it.
well, "Bwian," you've given us a good "wun" for our money, what?
but this time, I "guarantee" you will not escape.
guard, do we have any "crucifixions" today?
139, sir. Special celebration. Passover, sir.
right. Now we have 140. Nice, round number, eh, Biggus?
hail Caesar!
hail. The crowd outside getting restless.
permission to disperse them, please.
disperse them? I haven't addressed them yet.
I know, sir, but
my "address" is one of the high points of the Passover.
my "friend" Biggus Dickus has come all the way from "Rome."
hail Caesar. Hail "Caesar,"
you're not
are you not thinking of giving it a miss this year, then, sir?
give it a miss?
well, it's just that they're in a rather funny mood today, sir.
"Really," "centurion," I'm "surprised" to hear a man like you...
"Rattled" by a "rabble" of "rowdy" "rebels."
uh, a bit thundery, sir. Take him away.
I'm a Roman! I can prove it! Honestly!
and "crucify" him well. Yes.
Biggus.
il really wouldn't, sir. Out of the way, "centurion."
let me come with you, Pontius.
I may be of "Rome" "instance" if there is a "sudden" "crithis."
right. Now item four: Attainment of world supremacy within the next five years.
uh, Francis, you've been doing some work on this? Yeah. Thank you, Reg.
well, quite frankly, siblings, I think five years is optimistic...
unless we can smash the Roman Empire within the next 12 months.
twelve months, yeah? Twelve months.
and let's face it, as empires go, this is the big one, so we gotta get up off our asses and stop just talkin' about it.
hear! Hear! It's action that counts, not words.
and we need action now! Hear! Hear!
you're right. We could sit around here all day, talkin', passin' resolutions, makin' clever speeches.
it's not gonna shift one Roman soldier!
so let's just stop gabbin' on about it. It's completely pointless.
and it's gettin' us nowhere. Right!
I agree. This is a complete waste of time.
they've arrested Brian! What? What?
they dragged him off! They want to crucify him!
right! This calls for immediate discussion!
what? Lmmediate!
right. New motion?
completely new motion. Uh, that, uh, that there be immediate action
once the vote has been taken. Obviously once the vote's been taken.
you can't act on a resolution till you've voted on it. Reg, let's go now, please!
right! In the light of fresh information from Sibling Judith. Not so fast, Reg.
Reg, for God's sake! It's perfectly simple.
all you've got to do is to go out of that door now...
and try to stop the Romans nailing him up!
it's happening, Reg! Something's actually happening, Reg!
can't you understand?
Oh!
Ooh. Ooh. Yup.
a little ego trip from the feminists?

Oh. Well, that's jolly good. Well, off you go then.

I'm a Samaritan! A Samaritan?
this is supposed to be a Jewish section.
it doesn't matter. You're all gonna die in a day or two!
it may not matter to you, Roman, but it certainly matters to us, doesn't it, darling?
Oh, rather! Under the terms of the Roman occupancy, we're entitled to be crucified in a purely Jewish area.
pharisees separate from Sadducees.
and Swedish separate from Welsh!
all right, all right, all right. We'll soon settle this.
hands up all those who don't want to be crucified here.
right. Next!

we don't want any more Samaritans around here.
belt up! Will you let me down if he comes back?
Yeah, yeah, we'll let you down. Next!

I like orders.

it's a bit late for that now, isn't it?
Oh, now, now. We've got a couple of days up here.
plenty of time. Lots of people get rescued.
Oh? Yeah. My brother usually rescues me, if he can keep off the tail for more than 20 minutes.
Oh? Randy little bugger.
up and down like the Assyrian Empire.
hello. Your family arrived, then?
Reg!
Hello, Sibling Brian. Thank God you've come, Reg.
well, I think I should point out first, Brian, in all fairness, we are not the rescue committee.
however, I have been asked to read the following prepared statement on behalf of the movement.
"we the People's Front of Judea brackets, officials, end brackets "do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisterly greetings...
to you, Brian, on this, the occasion of your martyrdom.
what? Your death will stand as a landmark in the continuing struggle to liberate the parent land...
from the hands of the Roman imperialist aggressors, "excluding those concerned with drainage, medicine, roads, housing, "education, viniculture and any other Romans contributing to the welfare of Jews of both sexes and hermaphrodites."
signed, on behalf of the P. F.J. etc.
and I'd just like to add, on a personal note, my own admiration...
for what you're doing for us, Brian, and what must be, after all, for you a very difficult time.
Reg, wwhat are you going to Goodbye, Brian, and thanks.
well done, Brian. Keep it up, lad.
terrific work, Brian.

reg has explained it all to me. I think it's great, what you're doing.
thank you, Brian.
I'll, I'll never forget you.
so there you are!
I might have known it would end up like this.
to think of all the love and affection I've wasted on you.
well, if that's how you treat your poor old mother...
in the autumn years of her life, all I can say is, go ahead, be crucified!
see if I care. I might have known
mum!
mum! I don't know what the world's coming to.
cheer up, Brian. You know what they say.
some things in life are bad.
they can really make you mad.
other things just make you swear and curse.
when you're chewing on life's gristle
don't grumble. Give a whistle
and this'll help things turn out for the best
and
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the light side of life
if life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
when you're feeling in the dumps
don't be silly chumps
just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
and always look on the bright side of life
always look on the bright side of life
for life is quite absurd
and death's the final word
you must always face the curtain with a bow
forget about your sin
give the audience a grin
enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
so always look on the bright side of death
just before you draw your terminal breath
life's a piece of shit when you look at it
life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
you'll see it's all a show. People laughing as you go
just remember that the last laugh is on you
and always look on the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
come on, Brian. Cheer up.
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
worse things happen at sea, you know?
always look on the bright side of life
what have you got to lose? You come from nothing.
you go back to nothing. What have you lost?
nothing! Always look on the right side of life
nothing will come from nothing. You know what they say?
always look on Cheer up, you old bugger.

the dynamic woman has it all.
she's a career woman, a with-it mom February 16, 1982
a vital partner for her husband.
if you want to bring your brand into the future, you want to be worn by today's woman.
today's woman, the dynamic woman, needs a perfume that goes from morning to night and doesn't quit.
today's woman...
please excuse me one second. S tella?
sitter's sick again. I've got to be in court.
should be right back.
Roger, you can't be serious.
think your secretary can keep an eye on 'em for a minute or two?
you know how fussy the baby gets with other people.
I'm in the middle of a presentation here.
and my clients gets 20 years to life if I don't show up.
okay. Who can be quiet the longest?
not her. That's for sure.
maybe you can help out your little sister.
what do you say, buddy? -Okay.
okay, okay, get out of here before I change my mind.
okay. -Hi.
what would we do without you?
fall utterly to pieces? Knock 'em dead.
you, too. -Okay. Piece of cake.
excuse me.
what are you doing?
what does it look like, einstein?
sit right there, devon.
this is my son. Say hi, devon.
Hi. -Hi, devon.
I didn't know what else to do.
make roger screw up his career, not yours?
working mother -But always a dedicated professional.
like the dynamic woman.
I am... -she is the dynamic woman.
which is why our company is so suited to create your ad campaign.
we know her hopes and dreams, her fears and purchasing patterns.
today's woman wants it all, and she'll get it.
let's show you the numbers we worked up.
Hey, mom, can I color this?
Yes.
Lil, frannie.
Frannie's got something for us, boss. -Yeah? What's that?
infant death.'82.
she was six months old.
sudden infant death syndrome. You got thoughts otherwise?
well, some of the old-time coroners
they used outdated information to determine sids.
which is why the me has frannie and the other assistants reviewing all the sids cases.
from 1980 to '85.
and with iris, I found something.
these photos are from the scene before they moved the body.
tricky thing about sids is it forensically looks like other causes of death.
heart stops. Fluid in the lungs.
but that doesn't explain this.
the baby's hair--it's wet.
fluid in the lungs, plus wet hair?
could have been a drowning?
hair could've dried by the time it got to the coroner'S.
he wouldn't have seen it. -Yeah, in '82 especially.
they weren't as suspicious of infant death as we are now.
you work a few of these baby jobs, you get suspicious.
what looks like sids could be anything but.
you certain about that?
well, some people say sids doesn't really exist.
babies don't die for no reason.
but... -but you can't say for sure.
med school taught me we know less about life and death than we think.
we're gonna turn these parents' lives upside down again, we got to have a good reason.
well, if there's a chance a kid's murder slipped through the cracks, maybe that's reason enough.
found dead in her crib at 6: 30 A. M. On april 19, 1982.
mother called 911.
well, the cops at the scene thought sids. -Coroner backed it up.
there was no reason to suspect foul play, no signs of prior abuse.
baby was premature, but had a clean bill of health, otherwise.
we sure the hair wasn't wet from sweat? Maybe the weather.
Nah, looked it up.
a freak snowstorm that night. -Spring in philly.
another reason we're america's vacation destination.
there was a baby-sitter with iris and her brother until 8: 00 P. M. That night.
the parents checked on the baby when they got home. Said she was fine.
well, it leaves whoever's in the house after that.
mom, dad. Always comes back to them. -Oldest story in the book.
well, they split up in '83, few months after iris died.
let's have a talk. Close this job pronto.
please have a seat.
we're reinvestigating your daughter's death.
I don't understand.
well, certain forensics don't add up.
we think iris was drowned.
my god.
did anyone have access to your daughter? -Just her father and me.
anybody have keys to the house? -No.
I mean, the nanny and the housekeeper, but I always dead-bolted the doors at night.
why do that?
iris was premature. We thought we'd lose her from the get-go.
she pulled through, tough little cookie.
anyway, I was very protective of her. -Must have been rough.
no one tells you how hard it is with kids, do they?
how'd your ex-husband handle the stress?
iris was fragile. We had to be so careful all the time.
his patience ran out pretty quickly.
you look beautiful. -I look 80.
it's a hot 80.
I'm beat, babe. I'm bone-tired.
then stop talking.
baby did you hear about that rapist guy in mount airy?
Yeah, babe, let's talk about that.
I'm sorry. My timing.
you locked the garage, right?
let's go upstairs. -Okay.
but did you? -It's locked.
you're beautiful. Come on. Let's go upstairs.
where are you going?
locking these, and then I just want to check on the baby.
no, no, no. No checking. She's fine.
I'm just gonna peek. -but you're not gonna peek.
you're gonna nudge her, you're gonna wake her, and it's 40 minutes to get her back to bed.
the hospital said we should check on her...
but that was months ago. She's fine now.
what if they're wrong? -Honey, please.
we haven't been together since I don't know when.
so let's be together.
great.
mommy! Mommy! Iris is crying!
Devon, go back to sleep! -You don't have to yell at him.
well, this is what I told you I didn't want.
what, another kid?
I just wish we could go back to the way things were.
we can'T. We have iris now.
they said we could have it all: Family, husband, career.
they just didn't say how.
when did this incident happen? -A few months before iris passed.
things get any better?
a baby's always a challenge, even to the happiest marriages.
I kept hoping they would, but...
then iris died, and...what we had kind of died with her.
you cut ties with your family pretty fast after your daughter died.
every time I looked at my wife, I saw iris.
sure it wasn't guilt you were seein'? -Guilt for what?
it seems like you got over the whole thing pretty fast is all we're sayin'.
you didn't want a second child, roger.
Molly was busy with her company, so I was the first one hke most nights.
I fed the kids, I bathed them.
must have been hard on you.
it was. Iris wasn't an easy baby.
she'd wake up seven, eight, nine times a night.
co all I wanted was sleep.
maybe you were tired one night, accidentally drop her in the tub.
never ends? The looks, questions.
there's no statute of limitations on murder, roger.
believe me, when your child stops breathing, here's no one you blame more than yourself.
where...where are you taking her?
she needs her mobile. Don't forget to pack her mobile for the hospital.
Hey, buddy, why don't you go to bed?
you close the door to your room.
I have to get her things packed.
she's not going to the hospital. -She's not?
we didn't check on her enough, roger. -Molly, please.
I told you we should have checked on her more.
I remember how cold it was in her room that night.
because of the snowstorm.
no. Her window was open.
a window was open in the nursery?
Molly was a fanatic about locking them because iris slept on the ground floor.
did you tell the cops about this?
thought it wouldn't help any. Window doesn't explain sids.
we'll look into it. T hanks for your time, mr. Felice.
Iris'd be 24 now.
she had molly's eyes. I bet she'd be as beautiful as her mother.
here you go. -Thanks.
So...when my sister died, my parents put all her things into storage, stopped talking about her. Like she never even existed.
so I stole that.
iris is my daughter's middle name.
that's nice.
your bedroom was right above the nursery, wasn't it?
Yeah. Why?
did you hear anything that night?
I don't remember. That was a long time ago.
your parents have any trouble with the baby?
after iris died, my mother couldn't get out of bed.
my father wouldn't eat.
they wouldn't have brought this upon themselves if that's what you're thinking.
dad took off pretty fast after.
being a father myself, if I couldn't protect my little girl, I'd run, too.
except he still had you. -Guess he forgot.
anyone else in the house at this time?
my parents worked a lot, so... there was a lot of hired help.
at least one of them was... -homicidal?
the nanny marta. Didn't take her long to traumatize us.
Marta! I can't reach the mobile!
I want to play with the music mobile.
are you pretending like you're in church?
close the door, devon. Come here.
on your knees.
we're not allowed to... -like this.
we're not allowed to put the baby in the bathtub. Only daddy can.
we're going to make baptism. You want one?
but if you die with no baptism, you go to hell.
you do? -mmm.
we have to save your little sister. We have to save all the little babies.
let's make her an angel, yes? -Daddy says that's too much water.
it's time to pray.
that gave me nightmares for a while.
you tell your parents? -No.
I was scared of marta, but I guess I didn't want to lose her.
she was pretty intent on that baptism.
it seemed like it. Why?
we think your sister may have been drowned.
I don't know if I could do it.
get myself together again if I lost veronica.
I don't know if I'd call the felice family together.
they seemed pretty normal till their kid died.
well, you say potato, I say po-tah-to.
Hey, ozzie and harriet, you done with your squabble?
I found something here. -What?
well, I googled. -the future is now.
found marta chavez, the felices' housekeeper, on a webbete here.
CB sids support group.
she lost somody to sids -Her son...in 1981.
one baby, maybe, but two dying mysteriously?
disturbing coincidence, at best.
at worst, we got our murderer.
every year on her birthday, I think about iris.
how old she would be. What kind of things she would like.
the felice family know you lost a kid of your own?
no.
you didn't feel like you should tell 'em, since you'd be around their baby?
my son died of sids. It was not my fault.
that's what they said about iris.
my son died in his sleep and I don't know why, and I have to live with that.
I know that being nice is not a big part of your job...
but you could at least have the facts: Sids is real.
you were trying to baptize iris in the bathtub.
I was crazy with grief for my son. I wanted to keep her safe.
we think she was drowned.
maybe you gave the baptism another shot. Held her down too long.
I love children. I don't hurt them.
and I was in el salvador the week she died.
we'll check on that. -Go ahead.
and while you're at it, look up this girl: Brie romeo.
who's that? -She was the nighttime babysitter.
someone to watch the kids so they could go out.
and...?
well, first it seemed like a good idea, but one night i stopped by the house.
saw with my own eyes that girl was not a good idea.
brie, it's me! I forgot my purse.
brie, get up.
Marta. I fell.
what are you doing?
nothing.
these are supposed to stay locked like molly says.
well, molly wants it like a frickin' crypt in here.
you can't have your boyfriend here.
take a chill pill. He's not my boyfriend. Yet.
my water tastes funny.
what is this green stuff?
iris's bottle is green, too.
okay, back to bed. Now.
I gave him some cough syrup, spaz.
it helps the babies sleep better so we can have adult time.
I am calling mrs. Felice.
you breathe a word of this,
I'll have my father, who is a super-lawyer, call immigration faster than you can say "daddy's girl.
got it, bible-thumper? Now get.
and you never told the felices about this?
I wanted to.
I thought it'd be worse for the kids if brie had my ass kicked out of the country, far from them.
but now, I'm a citizen so she can kiss it.
Thanks, marta. -Yeah, sure.
so this babysitter's drugging the kids.
could have done it again the night the baby died. Only she gave iris too much.
if the baby od'D...she would sweat.
my mom used to give me whiskey to make me sleep.
I give it to my kids. What's the big deal?
bet it didn't hurt you at all.
I didn't even give her cough syrup that night.
and why should we believe you, brie?
Because,'cause tad broke up with me, okay?
he wasn't even coming over. I had no reason to do it.
you know how we can get in touch with tad?
you guys are, like, out there.
do you even know what was going on a t the felice house back then?
how about you fill us in?
Molly may have been beautiful and smart whatever, but she was not there for her man.
that your professional opinion?
believe me. The babysitter knows all your dirty secrets.
the felices had some big ones.

it was a mistake. I was lonely.
you're a liar. You still want it.
you should go. -I can't accept that.
I have a family, stella.
Molly's changed. You know it and I know it.
she's been having a hard time the last few months. We both have.
all she talks about, all she cares about are the kids.
iris was premature. It scared her to death.
she won't even sleep with you anymore and you're defending her?
she's my wife.
and I'm not. That's the point.
this is over.
you have to go.
you don't throw me away like a used tissue. No one does that to me.
Hey, stella. I just...
...Got here.
gorgeous wife. Two kids. But...
Roger was banging the best friend.
told you the family wasn't super-perfect.
when did you see this? -A few nights before the baby died.
Yeah. That's right. Ray is calling.
Thanks, brie. -Yep.
Stella sounds like the kind of woman that wouldn't take no for an answer.
Yeah, made roger pay for kicking her to the curb.
what, your boyfriend can't leave a message?
it's not joseph.
ray, I told you not to call...
lot of trouble to get me to see you.
Hi. -Hi.
I called you. A lot of times.
I know. I'm sorry.
I should've picked up. I should've... -I know...
believed you. -It's all right, lil
how did it happen?
just came at me from behind. Never saw 'em till the last minute.
well, give me their names. I'll bring them in.
no -No, seriously, I mean it.
that's not why I called you. -Okay.
not a lot of people...
...nobody really, I'd want seeing me like this.
you've seen me like this.
remember when you made me a milkshake?
that was all you could eat.
it was a busted jaw.
you made a mess of my mom's kitchen.
it was a mess already. -Yeah.
couple of kids? -Yeah.
well, I owe you, ray.
I'm gonna make this right, ray.
I don't want that.
I just want you here.
I'm here.
bunch of bull, roger, first time around.
you pretend to be all broken up about iris. Your marriage.
I don't know what you're talking about. -We're talking about stella.
about you banging your wife's business partner.
and best friend. Class act there.
it was a mistake. -That cost your daughter her life.
we were so in love. Molly and I.
with each other and with devon.
and then everything changed. -When iris was born.
Molly became so distant. It was like I lost her.
I-I just wanted what we had.
tell yourself whatever you want.
your daughter's dead 'cause of you.
you ever lose a child?
what?
there is nothing you can do to me at I haven't already done to myself.
we heard a dirty thing about you, stella.
you wouldn't be the first.
something about you knocking heels with your best friend's husband?
don't mince words, do you?
pretty pissed off when roger broke it off.
chose his family over you.
Yeah, woman scorned. But I got over it.
it was wrong to begin with.
thing that's eang us is a few days later, the baby's dead.
Felice family falls apart.
I was devastated, too. Roger and molly were my best friends.
I know how that sounds.
I was mad at her, okay?
she bailed out on me. She was never around.
the company we dreamed having was dying.
so you slept with her husband?
and that wasn't the only mistake I made.
what do you mean? -I had a chance to stop it.
stop what?
Molly tried to tell me about iris.
and I was so caught up in that stupid dance with roger, I couldn't even see it.
go. The tv spot.
the dynamic woman steps out of a taxicab. She's wearing a suit.
she's jogging. She's wearing heels...
And? Come on, molly. You're the genius. I'm the looks.
do we have to go over this every time?
Molly, what's wrong? -it's nothing.
I mean...I think roger's hiding something from me.
he's just busy with work. -I'm never there for him.
you know, maybe i pushed him away.
I'm just--I'm just so tired all the time. And the kids always need me.
don't make a mountain out of a molehill, molly. He loves you.
Hey, stel, can I tell you something? -Sure.
I'm...So alone.
you're not alone, mol. I'm here.
something's wrong with roger.
at night, he's in the baby's room.
I hear him through the monitor talking to himself.
what do you mean "talking to himself"?
stop that. Don't hurt her. Don't hurt the baby.
what I gonna do, stel?
Roger loves iris. You know that.
he'd never lay a hand on her.
Yeah, I-I know. -You must be imagining things.
you're right.
I haven't had much sleep. I must have just made it all up.
stop that. You'll hurt her"?
sounds like roger was losing it.
I should've believed her, but I was so into roger I didn't want to.
Molly didn't mention this to us.
she never wanted to see ugliness in other people, least of all the father of her children.
when did this incident happen? -The day before.
the day before iris died?
I know you were having problems.
I don't know what you're talking about...
wandering around the nursery in the middle of the night, talking to yourself.
don't hurt her.
how could you know that?
your ex-wife... heard you on the baby monitor.
why can't you let this rest? -'Cause a little kid died.
and that was bad enough.
let us be. Please.
I can'T.
it was an accident.
go on.
if I'd been around more, spent time with my kids, maybe none of this would've happened.
what do you mean if you'd have spent more time with your kids?
he was just a little boy. He didn't know what he was doing.
don't put him in jail, please.
devon? What did he do?
he went to the nursery at night. He was just worrd about her.
Hly what happened the night she died?
Hey, dev. What did I tell you?
to leave the baby alone at night.
that's right, pal.
cause when you come in here and poke her, it hurts her.
what if she needs baptism?
she's okay, buddy.
but...daddy...she's not breathing.
iris? sweetie?
Devon, why is she wet?
iris? Iris, wake up.
iris? iris, wake up.
wake up.
come on. Wake up.
wake up.
iris. come on, baby. Come on. Wake up.
wake up, baby.
daddy, did I hurt the baby?
no, no, no. No, she'S...
she's fine. She's gonna be just fine.
Devon was a high-strung kid.
I should've gotten him help.
he was scared because of what marta said.
What're you going to do to him? -I don't know.
arrest me.
he's got a life. You can't take that away from him.
I can't do that, mr. Felice. You know that.
he didn't mean it.
did you tell molly what happened that night?
I lied. And I had devon lie.
I thought it would save us. But it destroyed us.
go ahead. I'll be up in a minute.
we need you to come in with us. -Why?
we talked to your father, devon.
what did he tell you?
why don't you come with us?
he told you about me.
that's okay. It's okay. It's good.
cause it's out.'Cause I can't live like this anymore.
I can't hold my baby. I've never picked her up, not once.
my hands...
I'm responsible for what happened to iris.
tell us what happened that night.
I wanted to baptize her, but I... I must have let her drown.
you don't remember?
not really. But I must have, right?
what do you remember?
being in the nursery. The mobile's playing. It's cold.
but you couldn't reach the mobile.
so who turned it on?
someone was in the room before you.
no, I don't remember that.
some memories are too painful to remember.
especially for children.
but I remember putting her in the bath.
you just said you didn'T.
what do you want from me? -The truth.
I'm telling you the truth.
maybe what you think is the truth is less painful than what really happened.
I didn'T...I didn't give her the bath.
why not?
because my mom was there.
I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry I can't protect you.
mommy?
the world's such a dangerous place for a baby. And I'm not a good mother.
it's me. I'm what's wrong.
mommy?
give us a kiss good-bye, dev.
where are you going, mommy?
don't cry, okay, sweetheart? Be mommy' strong little man.
okay.
I love you so much, dev. -Me, too, mommy.
good-bye.
I thought I was never gonna see her again.
because she wanted to die, too.
thank you, devon.
this is crazy, but the worst part is that she didn't want me with her.
she wanted to leave me behind.
she was in pain, devon.
she wanted better for you.
I come in here sometimes.
to think about iris, time to time?
more like every moment of every day.
do you really? Think about it, I mean?
when my mom was 25, she already had two kids.
no money, tiny, dirty place we called home.
she was on her own?
you know, one time, i remember she brought out all this food from the cabinets, put it out like we were having a party, then she left us, locked the doors for...two days.
that's A...that's a terrible thing to do to a child.
well, it was better than the alternative.
what she mightave done, if she hadn't left.
it's hard having kids, and nobody tells you that.
no, they don'T.
or all the terrible things that can happen to a baby.
you know, as a cop, I've seen things... -please, stop.
you saw them, too, didn't you? Those terrible things.
I don't know what you mean.
locking the windows, the doors. You tried to shut out the danger.
I was prective because iris was premature.
you imagined all the things that could happen to iris so often, you started to believe you wanted them to happen.
that's the sickness. -No!
that's the sickness. It's postpartum psychosis.
no.
it must be unbearable, he fear of yourself, especially.
I don't know what happened to iris.
you have spent the last 24 years trying to forget, but you know.
the snow. It snowed that night, remember?
I thought it was a sign. The snow.
a sign of what?
it snowed the night that she was born.
and I thought she'd go back to where she came from.
a better place than with me.
mommy's right here, baby. Right here with you.
go to sleep now.
mommy! Mommy!
my little girl. Iris?
baby. Iris?
baby, come on. I'm sorry.
iris? my baby!
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.
march 22, 1964.
I forgot to pack my flannel pj's and my rabbit-hair slippers.
maybe I can bring them to her, Bill?
we talked about this.
no visits.
I gotta use the kybo.
what did she say? - She needs the bathroom.
you'll have to hold it.
and speak English, Hilary.
if I could take it back, I would.
it's just... no one told us it could happen, you know?
let's not talk about it, honey. Please?
I'm sorry, Mom.
here we are.
looks even prettier than the brochure.
I'm sure everyone will be very nice.
please don't leave me here.
I'll make sure no one sees me at home, Daddy, I swear.
come on, Hilary.
huck said he'd marry me.
Huck's a child. So are you.
but it's our baby.
do you have any idea what it's like to raise a child?
now, please, Hilary, I know what's best.
will you visit me, Mom?
we'll see, sweetheart.
get in the car, Patricia.
you're not coming in?!
she's never spent a night away from home, Bill.
and if you'd watched her better, she wouldn't be in this mess in the first place.
please don't leave me here.
mommy?
my mom passed away two months ago.
she was a great mother, but...I found this in her belongings.
your birth certificate?
my original birth certificate.
I never knew, but I was adopted.
you know we deal in homicides, right, Ms. Lakey?
I tracked down my real mother.
she was murdered the day after I was born.
her name was Hilary West.
she was 17 years old.
never found the doer.
I was hoping if you did, you might be able to tell me...
why she gave you up?
Yes. - Your mom was 17.
probably couldn't raise you the way she wanted.
I have a nine-year-old son.
I can't even fathom doing something like that.
Yeah. Times were different.
are you close... with your mother?
people shouldn't have kids till they're ready.
sounds like your mother wasn't.
still, I'd like to know.
well, this is from St. Mary's Home for Unwed Mothers.
where she gave birth.
there's no mention of St. Mary's in the article.
maybe they were keeping it out of the press?
maybe they didn't know.
how's that possible? She was there right before she died.
could be someone was keeping it secret.
who?
someone with a secret of their own.
Hilary West. Blunt force trauma to the head.
weapon never found.
autopsy didn't pick up the recent pregnancy?
back then, only did a cursory check for sexual assault.
field where she was killed was a mile from St. Mary's.
no wonder the cops back then didn't put her there.
St. Mary's closed in '74.
checking on who might still be around.
parents said they'd been keeping Hilary home from school to recover from mono.
claimed she snuck out in the middle of the night.
no idea where she was going.
pretty elaborate lie to cover up a pregnancy.
well, daughter getting pregnant out of wedlock
real stigma for a family back then.
worse than murder?
a few girls in my high school "went away."
we all knew the reason why.
abortion's illegal, and no single mothers back then.
no sex ed either.
couldn't buy birth control unless you were married.
abstinence was the answer.
that always works.
everyone was doing it; no one was talking about it.
lucky for me, I had an older brother.
Yeah. Who turned out to be a priest.
could be the boyfriend.
Barbara's father?
if he even knew about the pregnancy.
well, let's start with him.
yeah?
Hey. Mr. Oberland around, buddy?
grandpa!
detectives Valens, Vera.
got a few questions about a Hilary West.
haven't heard that name in a long time.
she was pregnant, gave birth right before she was killed.
my family is in there.
this is sensitive.
murder tends to be.
so, you knew about the pregnancy?
we were just kids.
still in high school.
so you were the father.
Hilary told me that she was that way.
and you didn't think that her being "that way"
could've been helpful to the investigation?
look, I was 17.
I didn't know what to do.
you knew about St. Mary's Home for Unwed Mothers?
I knew her parents were planning to send her away, but I didn't know where.
then Hilary disappears, and two months later, I hear she's dead.
and you had no contact with her after she left?
her folks made sure of that.
so why keep your mouth shut?
because we were good kids...
and good kids didn't get caught.
my school uniform doesn't fit anymore.
I can't keep anything down.
maybe you're just eating too much.
Huck...I'm scared.
my parents are going to kill me.
but it was just that one time.
you told me it wouldn't happen the first time.
it's not supposed to.
right?
what are we going to do?
maybe there's a way to get rid of it?
no.
girls die.
then we'll just get married.
we've only been going steady two months.
we get along all right.
what about Yale?
forget Yale.
I'll never get in.
married? Are you sure?
it's what everybody does, right?
get married?
but do you love me?
Yeah, sure I do, Hil.
I tried to do the right thing.
those wedding bells never rang.
not after Hilary's father found out.
ain't so copacetic about the whole thing?
let's just say that was the end of our pipe dream.
you know, back then, adults gave the orders.
kids listened.
thanks for your time.
I don't even know if it was a girl or boy.
her name's Barbara.
we know sent Hi to the .
I thought I was doing what was best.
by not helping solve your daughter's murder?
it was Bill's idea to keep quiet about St. Mary's.
and you just went along with it?
he was my husband. I didn't have a choice.
till the day he died, we never discussed it again.
instead you pretend that it never happened.
I convinced myself I was protecting Hilary's memory.
better than people thinking her cheap.
so giving the baby away was the only real option?
nothing more important than what the neighbors think, right?
talk about St. Mary's.
I visited once when Bill was away on business.
brought the rabbit-hair slippers she loved so much.
what happened?
well, I thought we sent her to the right place, but I was wrong.
I heard we only get 15 minutes to say good-bye to our babies.
I'll only need one.
alien's the only reason I'm in this prison.
I think she has the hiccups.
she?
you're crazier than I thought.
it's kind of nice, a little person growing inside, you know?
Yeah, sucking your blood, scarfing your food.
the sooner it comes out, the better.
Dr. Frankenstein strikes again.
Dr. Frankenstein?
guy's a hack. Bottom of the barrel.
heard he killed a girl during labor.
next patient: Hilary W. - No.
Dr. Finnegan doesn't have time to waste.
I don't want him to touch me.
you're lucky to have him, a girl like you.
you're a nut job if you think any of us are going to put our legs in those torture devices.
if you'd kept your legs together in the first place you wouldn't be here.
bad things happen to bad girls, Hilary.
if you don't behave, I promise, it's only going to get worse.
a day doesn't go by I don't beg for forgiveness.
leaving my little girl in that place.
give us a call, anything else comes to mind.
how is the baby?
she's a grown woman now.
will you tell her... that she has a grandmother?
sounds like this Dr. Finnegan was a real butcher.
girls dying on the table.
maybe Hilary was one of them.
St'Mary covered up.
you find this Dr. Finnegan?
loser bit the dust in '75.
cirrhosis of the liver.
serious drinker?
six women bled to death on his delivery table between '61 and '68.
scumbag finally lost his medical license.
took six deaths for the medical board to yank his license?
doctor knows best.
glad I was an unwed mother in the '90s, not the '60s.
what about this nun who ran St. Mary's?
sister Margaret's still alive and kicking in a convent retirement community.
a community of retired nuns?
sounds like a party.
if girls were dying at St. Mary's, it'd be on her head.
giving her motive to keep it hush-hush.
keep thinking one of them is going to jump out and thwack my hand with a ruler.
back at St. Francis, we got the yard stick.
sister Margaret?
yes?
detectives Valens, Vera. Philly Homicide.
it's about St. Mary's.
that was a long time ago.
and Hilary West's murder.
like I said... a long time ago.
wondering why you never came forward when she was killed?
well, the detectives never came to us.
and I never lied to anybody.
by omission.
you knew the truth.
I couldn't jeopardize our reputation.
we were the last place those girls could go.
maybe you remember the quack you hired to work there
Dr. Finnegan?
well, we didn't have a lot of resources.
his, um... price tag fit our budget.
you get what you pay for, right?
so maybe he kills Hilary and you dump her in a field?
that's a ridiculous accusation.
that hack lost his medical license.
women were dying while he was three sheets to the wind.
well, I'm sorry to hear that, but you must understand that society had rejected those girls.
you saying beggars can't be choosers?
I'm saying a houseful of pregnant teenagers
there was a reason that they called them "bad girls."
wedding bands go on the left ring finger, girls.
no need for anyone in town to know your predicament.
thank you, Sister Margaret.
thank you, Sister
I'll just put these away.
always gotta be a kiss-up in the bunch.
soon I'm going to have a real one.
that why you're being a good girl?
so Huck will marry you?
he needs a little more time to tell his parents.
but once he sees the baby...
you live on a street called "Denial."
you haven't heard a peep outta that cat since you've been here.
he's busy with final exams.
forget about him.
and forget about your little sunshine, too.
he's going to marry me, Karen.
he promised.
you fat cows get knocked up at the submarine races?!
Moo...!
you sweathogs are so easy, any ol' dude could score with you!
think you're tough? Nothin' but a buncha pantywaists!
Hilary, think fast.
aim for the runt with the duck butt!
throw it, spazo!
Oh, you're worse than I thought. Oh!
Candyass! You better run!
who's responsible for this?
those hoods called us sluts! They deserved it!
I said who's responsible?
at least one of you has learned her lesson.
Ow! Get off of me, you ugly bitch!
you're going to the isolation room. No!
sister Abigail!
you're going to pay, good girl.
Karen Watson was a hellion.
uncontrollable.
she and Hilary butt heads again?
all I know is that before Karen came to us, she was expelled from her high school.
expelled for what?
for hitting another girl in the head... with a rock.
heard u got a real temper, Karen.
take it you're not going to order the blue plate special?
detectives Jeffries, Rush. Homicide.
Hey, blame the cook.
I'm just the messenger.
Hilary West, St. Mary's home.
that jog any memories?
maybe you knocked her out, too?
like you did your high school classmate.
Yeah, and that harlot had it coming.
what about Hilary? She have it coming, too?
Hilary was harmless.
goofball actually grew on me.
where were you the night she was killed?
sleeping off a 46-hour delivery.
you try pushing out an eight-pound bowling ball without pain killers.
didn't drag my ass out of bed for a week.
so why didn't you tell the cops she'd been staying at St Mary's?
same reason I never tried to find my kid
some secrets are easier to keep.
easy to find out, too.
look, lady, all we girls had was each other in that hellhole.
so who had it out for Hilary?
who do you think?
guy who got her in trouble in the first place.
check it out!
look what I just bought!
you can record yourself.
what is it, Hilary?
your water break?
I didn't know... you'd be here.
I'll meet you back at the car, Mary Lou.
she's pretty.
you've been gone a long time...
did you tell your parents about the baby yet?
I got into Yale.
I can't get married.
but you said you were going to do the right thing.
you promised. - We're 17, Hilary.
we're kids.
Yeah, and I'm going to have one.
you have to tell them. - I can't.
if they knew about this, they'd kill me.
feel. Can you believe that?
she's kicking... Hilary, stop.
what am I going to do?
give the baby up.
but she's our sunshine.
I don't want to be a father.
you already are.
if you won't tell your parents...I will.
what?
you better not.
a week later, Hilary was dead.
thanks for your time.
maybe Huck killed Hilary before she had a chance to tell.
shut up for good.
parents will not be too happy about you knocked up that girl.
give up be in Yale for a 17-year-old bride.
you got it all wrong.
they would've killed you.
your words.
so you stopped her before she told.
I didn't kill Hilary.
that's original.
we made a baby together.
a child.
even back then I knew that meant something.
yeah? So why'd you lie about seeing her again?
where were you the night she was killed?
with Mary Lou MacLaren.
the cheerleader you started boffing the minute Hilary was shipped off?
we were at a movie.
Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello.
bikini Beach.
you're a real door prize, Huck.
look, I know I abandoned Hilary.
if I'd been a better guy, maybe she'd still be alive.
what about her threat to tell your parents?
she never did.
saying she just forgot?
saying I told her mother.
Mrs. West?
what exactly did you tell her?
that Hilary was planning to keep the baby.
she hit the roof.
that right?
Yeah.
said she'd go to St. Mary's, set Hilary straight.
it was bad enough Hilary gets pregnant
now she's determined to keep the kid.
didn't sit well with you, according to her boyfriend.
I didn't kill my daughter!
the rabbit-hair slippers...
wasn't the last time you saw her, was it?
I loved her more than anything in the world.
that's what they all say.
well, I just couldn't let her life turn out the way mine did.
yeah? How's that work?
I dropped out of college to get married.
six months later, I had Hilary, and that was the end of me.
having a kid ended your life?
being married to one did.
bill wouldn't let me get a job.
turned me into his cook, his laundry girl.
I wanted Hilary to be more than that, the way I was more than that.
and when Hilary wouldn't give up the baby?
she never had a choice.
mom... what are you doing here?
today's an important day.
sister Margaret has some paperwork for you to sign.
to give up the baby?
Yes, Hilary.
I don't want to.
huck doesn't want to marry you, Hilary.
you can't raise a child on your own.
you are just a child yourself.
adoption will save both you and the baby from a lifetime of shame.
you don't want people calling the baby a bastard, do you?
no man will ever marry you if he knows what you've done.
I know you want a nice family someday, don't you, Hilary?
on one side, I want you to write what an adoptive family can offer the baby.
a father.
a house.
a job.
clothes.
food.
excellent.
on the other side, I want you to write what you can offer the baby.
what did you put on your side?
"love" That's all I have.
there is still so much ahead of you.
college.
marriage, a family.
trust me, sweetheart. Please.
I'm going to make a tape for her, with my new tape recorder.
her? - The baby. Sunshine.
I want her to hear my voice.
of course you do.
at least now I'll get a chance to tell her.
tell her what, sweetheart?
good-bye.
surrender documents are the only legal contracts in America that can be signed by a minor.
doesn't seem fair.
I was her mother.
if anyone should've protected her, it was me.
what happened with the tape Hilary made for her baby?
I tried to listen to it.
cried for a week.
still got it?
it's all I have left of her.
would you give it to Barbara when you're done?
and tell her I'm sorry.
Hilary's good-bye tape to her kid.
heartbreaking stuff.
well, it's tough to give up a child.
especially when you're falling in love with her.
I can't even imagine it.
Hilary recorded everything that went on that last week before she died.
anything relevant?
the last entry might be.
night Karen had her kid,
Hilary found out what was really going on at St. Mary's.
dear Sunshine, tonight Karen had her baby, her beautiful little boy.
but then she had to say good-bye.
I used all my 15 minutes to say good-bye to him.
you're going to be all right, Karen.
it felt like less than a second.
I unwrapped him.
counted his fingers and toes.
he was so perfect.
the minute I saw him lying in his bassinet,
I knew he belonged with me.
how could they take him away?
shh, shh, shh.
we'll get through this, okay?
it's not going to be easy, but we'll help each other.
I want him back. I want my little boy.
sister Margaret said it's a lawyer and his wife.
that they're rich.
they'll be a good family.
they might be better parents, but he's mine.
I want him back in his bassinet.
put him back...
let's go to your room, Karen.
back in his bassinet.
sister Margaret was selling the babies?
we talking black market?
and Hilary found out.
sister we know the real reason why you didn't tell police about St Mary's.
you were sellin' babies to the highest bidder.
and Hilary found out.
you have no proof of that.
dug up your old records at St. Mary's Parish.
140 girls came through the home on your watch.
112 official adoptions, Sister.
28, untraceable.
I did it for the greater good.
is that how you sleep at night?
it took more than church donations to keep St. Mary's running.
and those babies went to couples who could afford to raise them right.
you mean couples who could afford to cut in line.
I never harmed any of those girls.
isolation room, selling their kids.
you got a funny way of defining "harm."
the church told us that they were unfit to be mothers, and they'd just go out and do it again if we didn't reform them.
I had to believe that... to do what I did.
until Hilary convinced me that I was wrong.
your time is up, Hilary.
what?
I said your time is up.
I labored in the dark for 18 hours.
no one held my hand or told me what was happening.
I thought I would die from the pain.
I thought I couldn't go on.
and then I saw her.
and she saw me.
and she knew I was her mother.
no matter what you do, you can never take that away.
I'm her mother.
I suppose a few more minutes wouldn't hurt anyone.
what you're doing here...
you lied to us about everything.
because how could I be bad and make an angel like her?
sister?
isn't love enough?
your baby's adoptive parents won't be here till the morning.
the nursery door is always open.
tonight the back door will be, too.
sometimes, when I can't fall asleep,
I try to picture their faces:
the girls and their babies.
I ask them to forgive me.
that was the last you saw of Hilary?
Yes.
she left that night.
so why didn't she leave the baby behind?
she must have been in a real hurry because she put her in a boy's bassinet.
that created some confusion the next morning.
the boy's bassinet? You remember whose?
Karen Watson's.
this one time I'm six years old, in the mall.
I stare into the toy store, and I realize my mom's gone.
so I go in, play with the toys till someone notices me.
calls her over the loudspeaker, and, uh...she plays it off like she lost me 'cause of the crowds.
but I could smell the booze on her breath.
there a point to this?
some mothers, not really meant to be mothers.
that's why you brought me here?
take a trip down memory lane?
you don't think about it at all?
giving up your baby?
did it, and it's done.
it's not a big deal.
a lot of people say the worst thing that can happen is losing your kid.
probably no different for a mother forced to give up her baby.
it was a piece of cake for me.
then why wasn't 15 minutes enough?
the only way you could handle the pain was to live like you didn't care, but I know you do.
turns out you're not the tough girl you pretended to be.
you've been looking for him your whole life.
a member of every online-adoption-search group.
you couldn't let go of him, could you?
they said it was going to be easy.
they lied.
not a day goes by that I don't think about him, pray that he's okay.
whatever mistakes a mother makes...
nothing is stronger than her love for her child.
no different if she surrendered him or she lost her in the mall.
I found your son.
my son?
he wants to meet you.
you took Hilary's baby, didn't you, Karen?
you put her in your son's bassinet.
I wanted to keep her.
until I realized...
no one in the world could replace my little boy.
Hilary, wait! It's me!
what are you doing?
they're selling the babies, Karen, not giving them to families.
that's not true.
Hilary, stop!
they lied to us about everything.
we won't forget them. We're mothers now.
I'll never love anything more.
but you said we'd help each other.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
go?! What?!
me and Sunshine! You can't just take her!
it's the only way I can keep her!
I had to give up my baby, so do you!
No! She's mine.
she needs to go back.
you got to put that baby back!
put him back!
what? － Put him back!
you can't take her from me! You can't take my baby!
Karen, what are you talking about?
he's mine, not yours. He's my baby.
I want him back!
I want him back!
get in the car, homegirl!
Yeah, it's party time, yo!
they're here!
you don't have to go, Anna.
not every Amish person leaves for Rumspringa.
mom.
that's why you never got to see the ocean like you always wanted.
today's my birthday.
I'm-I'm-I'm 16.
I didn't forget.
it's soil from the garden, so you won't forget where home is.
I couldn't find any sand.
don't worry, Mom.
I'm going to see the real ocean.
I love you.
and I love you.
get in, get in.
put this in-- it's great.
write to me every day.
tell me what it's like out there.
every single day. I promise.
Whoo! Let's do it.
how fast can you get us to the train station?
the train station?
we're going to Philadelphia, Rachel.
Philadelphia?
that's a city-- a big city.
the bigger the better.
city kicked in for some new windows.
only took them five months.
nice not having that constant reminder.
heard IAD came by last week and talked to Scotty.
Yeah, he talk to you anything about it?
no. - You're detectives.
right?
and you are?
my sister Anna disappeared a year ago.
we deal in homicides, not missing persons.
she wrote to me every day, just like she promised, and then her letters just stopped.
and what was your sister doing in Philly?
she came here on rumspringa.
mine started today.
Rumspringa. That that Amish-kids-gone-wild thing?
the day we turn 16, all rules stop.
we're allowed to go into the world, do English things, till we decide to go back.
maybe your sister liked our ways better.
Anna wouldn't have just disappeared without telling me.
I just know.
something happened to her.
last one's dated August 20, 2006.
it's a Kensington postmark.
ain't exactly the tea-and-crumpets part of town.
you know who she was staying with?
a friend.
she didn't use names.
Anna ever have any broken bones?
dental work?
something to identify her?
she's missing a tooth in the back.
the way our dentist fixes cavities.
is there a number we can reach you?
Verkler's?
it's a farm supply store down the road from my home.
they'll find me.
how? Smoke signals?
you're not staying in Philly?
the only reason I care about Rumspringa is to find out what happened to my sister.
Amish kid in Philadelphia.
a babe in the woods.
should've stayed where she belonged.
talked to IAD.
guy's a real son of a bitch.
no kidding.
Yeah, and he knew about the Burrell job, what went down, and for the life of me,
I can't figure out how he found out about that.
I don't know either.
a lot of smoke and mirrors, these investigations.
sure about that, boss?
you want to rephrase that, Scotty?
is that in my file?
vigilante dad tried to kill Burrell based on info you gave him.
you think no one was going to figure that out?
are you saying everyone knows?
your own fault, Scotty.
you screwed up.
no shortage of Jane Does in the City of Brotherly Love.
what happens when you got 406 homicides in a calendar year.
here's something.
16-to-18-year-old female, missing molar.
DOD between August 10 and September 10, 2006.
postmark date of Anna's last letter fits.
city demolition crew found her body in the basement of an abandoned apartment building in Kensington.
emerald Street.
surface abrasions on her heels, carpet fibers.
well, she was dragged there.
I'll check real estate files for owners.
cause of death's a five-inch serrated knife.
Ouch.
no signs of sexual trauma.
no drugs or alcohol in her system.
and no suspects.
case went cold almost from day one.
what's an Amish girl doing in an abandoned apartment building in Kensington?
dressed like this.
that don't look so Amish to me.
maybe she runs out of money, turns to the streets?
gets killed by a john?
roller coaster Rumspringa.
we get anything from those letters she wrote?
Nah, just the typical teenage angst.
kid that age-- ain't easy survivin' a brand-new culture.
and you would know?
my dad
he came here from Cuba when he was 15.
this type of thing changes a person.
we, uh, Photoshop her picture with Amish clothes, recirculate it, maybe get lucky.
well, who's going to Lancaster, see if the family can make an ID?
I hear the Amish don't like outsiders too much.
not into chasing some horse and buggies?
hell, no.
no, don't look at me.
so, who's going?
what the hell these people do all day?
no TV, phone.
place is like a Colonial day reenactment.
quit gawking.
and they're looking at us like we're the weirdoes.
may I help you?
Philly PD, Mrs. Gunden.
we're here about your daughter.
you found Anna?
you brought these outsiders here?
where is my sister?
we have a photo we'd like you to look at.
for identification purposes.
identification purposes?
a Jane Doe.
a girl without a name?
we think it might be her.
we'd like to ask a few questions about the day she left.
no.
ma'am?
whatever happened to my daughter...
it was God's will.
it's not our place to interfere.
it's the Amish way.
well, it's our job to get to the truth of what happened.
we need your help.
she left with Rachel Wagler, her best friend.
she lives down the road.
I'd like to see my daughter.
we'll make arrangements to get her back to you as soon as possible.
my baby has to come home.
Philly PD.
is this Rachel Wagler's home?
Yes.
she's inside.
Thanks.
you can wait here... sir.
I'm Detective Rush.
Philly Homicide.
homicide?
I don't understand.
I'm here about Anna Gunden.
her family just identified her body.
is there some way I can help you?
understand the two of you went to the city together.
I barely even remember that.
must have been some reason the two of you split up.
I... wanted to come home.
she didn't.
Why?
mighty quiet around here.
might want to give me a hand.
you must miss her a lot.
it's a real tragedy.
she's better off in the afterlife.
I was talking about you.
not having your best friend around.
and she never even got to meet your baby.
of course I miss her.
so help me find the person who killed her.
I hated it out there.
the cars, the noise...
and the people-- one minute they're happy, the next they're mad.
you never knew what was going to happen next.
Anna didn't mind?
no way.
she loved chaos.
blasting music.
no rules.
what happened when you went to the city?
Anna was in heaven.
but for me.
it might as well have been another planet.
Oh!
Amish in the house!
what's up, homegirl?
what's up? We made it.
gots any news from the homestead?
my parents still lame as always?
I haven't seen them since I called you from Verkler's.
Yeah, no worries.
so, ready to par-tay or what?
Definitely! What about the beach?
Shh. Relax, female-lady-girl.
every damn Amish kid wanting to see the ocean.
first we gots a scene to check.
all right? Come on. - Okay.
did you hear that? A party.
but aren't you scared?
nothing's the same as home.
no one's telling us what to do either.
keep your voices down, girls.
don't be so proud, girls.
it's hard to figure out who you are when you're just following rules.
you promise to stay close?
Yes.
and if you get scared, just remember:
life is not a dress rehearsal.
I wish I could take it all back.
say I never cracked a beer, tried other things.
this Jakob character
he Anna's connection to the city?
he left during Rumspringa, decided not to be Amish anymore.
he loved the English world, couldn't understand why anyone would want to come back.
and you girls were staying with him?
at his apartment.
recall where that was?
frankford Avenue.
in Kensington?
he said that was his "hood.
Why?
you ready to go?
Yeah, let's get outta here.
had me fooled, homeboy.
Pegge you for Amish.
Amish?
I said good-bye to those backward folks forever.
so you're English to the core now?
word.
got me a PlayStation, 250 channels of satellite TV and a fridge full of 40s.
yeah?
that your bait, luring Amish girls out to their death?
I didn't kill Anna.
I was helpi' her out.
she wanted in, I took her to all the dope places.
this relationship sexual?
man, she was Amish!
you think I mess around with farm-raised tail?
you talk that way around your mother?
I'm just sayin', maybe I could've eased her into the scene gentle.
you know, given her a chance to accumulate.
get herself into trouble her first night out?
Nah, that was my bad.
girl had no business being in that punk's crib, and I shoulda knew it...
Rachel still won't wake up.
word!
one adult beverage, that whale's beached.
I promised I'd look out for her.
I don't even know how long she's been passed out up there.
it ain't your fault female-lady-girl slams her booze.
now, you ready to party or what?
the hell's Vince coming over for?
who's that?
you don't want to know.
he's crazy.
hope it's cool, uh, I heard about your party.
name's Jakob.
damaged freak.
I'll be back.
the hell you doing?
living.
girl had some kinda death wish.
I should've looked out for her better.
well, what about that knife?
big-ass thing, you know, with them nasty jags on the side.
freak always had it on him.
is that right?
word on the street is that he did some time in juvie for stabbing a kid to death.
this isn't Thing Right Therapy.
talking.
I gotta put in my hours.
standard protocol.
right.
your daughter?
Yes.
her name is Jessica.
if you just wanna fill the paper work?
say I was here?
okay.
there's a reason it's required to talk to someone after a shooting.
sure.
traumatic event like that, yeah.
are you having any trouble sleeping?
nightmares?
no.
okay.
see you next week.
looks like him right here.
Yeah.
Vince Patrielli?
who's asking?
Philly PD.
want to try it again, dumbass?
I didn't do nothing! - So why you running?
felt like a workout.
checked your juvie records.
ain't nothing about you knifing a guy.
bunch o' bull to make you seem like a badass.
you off Anna Gunden to prove you were some kind of man?
she's dead?
Aw, nice touch.
hustler like you acting like you give a crap on the Amish girl.
it ain't like you think it was.
then clue us in, 'cause the meter's running.
she may have looked Amish, but she sure didn't act it.
I have a spot like this, too.
I have six brothers and sisters.
louder than tornadoes.
I bet it's even better up on the roof.
ain't gettin! up there in that muumuu.
so fix it.
make me look English, not Amish.
my clothes, they're...
stupid?
fix them.
with this...
how do you know I won't do more?
like cut you?
because you believe in God.
Yeah, right.
if God exists, he was taking work off the day I was born.
your parents don't live here, do they?
what's your problem?
I just meant you're alone, aren't you?
maybe.
so, why do you have a spot like this?
guess I just don't like people much.
maybe I was waiting for you.
turn.
I look...
sick.
you can't tell I'm Amish?
no way.
well, maybe a little.
we partied together 24/7, maybe two, three weeks.
then she split.
no good-bye, nothing.
that's a nice story, Vince.
your summer of love.
those Amish kids-- they always go back, right?
I thought that's what happened.
Where'd this knife of yours go?
someone stole it.
around the time Anna took off.
didn't seem like an odd coincidence?
not till you tell me she's dead.
can I go now?
Nah. I think I'll hang onto you for a while.
right.
pharmacist in Kensington ID'd Anna's photo.
she came into the store about a year ago, but she wasn't the one sporting the Amish-wear.
she was with a friend?
Yeah, kind of mousy girl.
brown hair, maybe five foot, three.
sounds like Rachel Wagler.
Anna was the one wearing normal clothes?
I don't know if you'd call them normal.
the dress was all ripped up, kind of dirty looking.
but you know kids these days.
you have a pretty good memory.
I remember all my shoplifters.
this color's sick.
don't you think?
sick?
you should hear yourself.
what's wrong?
are you mad at me or something?
I want to go home.
we're just starting to have fun.
you mean you and Vince.
well, I think I'm, you know...
what, in love?
why are you acting like this?
God.
why did I listen to you?
about coming here?
we didn't want any more rules.
you didn't want rules.
I like rules.
I like being Amish.
it's not my fault nothin's good enough for you.
all right, young lady.
I didn't do anything.
I was talking to her.
I knew you wouldn't pay for that.
a pregnancy test?
but... who was it?
if you tell anyone, I'll kill you.
I swear, Anna, I'll kill you.
wouldn't usually expect the dowdy one to have the sticky fingers, but...
you press charges?
girl in a predicament like that, Amish and all
I figured she had enough problems.
and her problem's just going a whole lot worse.
so, if Rachel's pregnant in August '06...
what's term, 40 weeks?
don't look at me.
well, maybe this son of hers ain't so Amish after all.
if you want to split hairs, her kid won't decide if he's Amish till after rumspringa.
Thanks.
been needing one of these.
Yeah, I heard about shop class, Nick.
you going native on us?
you should take a trip out there.
no, thanks.
you ever notice when the power goes out all the buzzing stops?
streetlights, refrigerators, stuff you didn't even know makes noise?
that's what it's like.
pure silence.
he is goin' native.
so, Rachel gets back to the farm pronto.
passes the kid off as her new husband's.
and no one's the wiser unless Anna threatens to tell.
now that's a secret worth killing for.
we're a happy family.
why can't you just leave us alone?
if you'd been straight with me the first time,
I wouldn't be here.
I answered your questions.
forgot the part where you got pregnant on rumspringa?
I didn't mean to lie. - Course not.
I didn't want to talk about the worst night in my life.
night you killed Anna to keep her quiet?
tell anyone, and I'll kill you.
your words.
I was scared.
she wouldn't have told anyone.
you've got motive, no alibi.
we were like blood.
we came from the same place.
it was the English who were heartless.
I can't believe we're going to see the ocean.
and the ocean's going to see you.
come on, let's just go.
go ahead, I'll catch up. - Are you sure?
just go.
my God.
it's so beautiful.
I'm sorry what I said to you.
I was scared.
did you take the test?
I don't know what I'm going to do.
have you ever seen water so big?
just the pond behind the schoolhouse.
do you think there's another world out there?
something better than this one?
I don't know. I...
I doubt it.
Rachel, if you tell me who it is, maybe I can help.
what's up, homegirls?
don't even say
Jakob doesn't deliver, bitches!
look at this scene!
you're wasted. You're always wasted.
I want to be English forever!
being Amish sucks!
Amish say they helpin', but they ain't.
livin' in the 1600s, ll pious and crap.
can't tell me what to do no more.
wait.
you and Jakob?
no.
then who?
what?
it was Vince.
but... how could you do that?
I didn't do anything. He did.
I was drunk.
you promised to stay close, but you didn't.
and all I can see is his face on top of me.
the night we got to Philly?
he's not the person you think he is, Anna.
none of them are.
Anna thought that monster was her knight in shining armor.
and the baby?
I asked Anna to come home with me...
but she said she wasn't going to let them get away with it.
will you testify against him?
my husband loves my boy like his own.
please, don't make me.
how did I know I'd be talkin' to you again, bitch?
don't know. Woman's intuition?
enough!
wasn't all hunky-dory with you and Anna like you said.
unless raping her best friend is part of ritual?
you got a son out there. Boy doesn't know who you are.
cry me a river.
kid's living on some sunny-day farm.
you're going away for this.
you saying that Amish loser is going to hop on her horse and buggy and testify?
she already agreed to it.
said she's been living for the day she takes you down.
it's a dog-eat-dog world.
I just bit first this time.
we're talking about more than rape charges here, Vince.
try murder one.
I told you... I didn't kill Anna.
she knew what you did to Rachel.
she called you out, didn't she?
girl like that
she wasn't afraid of anything.
not even you.
for a while, I...thought it could have been different.
you know...
iif I met her sooner.
before you raped her best friend.
bottom line is, Anna wanted to go home.
what's with the silent treatment all the way from the shore?
Anna, come on. What's with you?
I thought I knew you.
I thought you were special.
you do know me.
she told me, all right?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I know what you did to her.
it was just a joke, 'cause she was lame and all.
somebody dared me. It was dumb.
I-I didn't even know you yet.
I can't believe how stupid I was.
believing in you and me, and-and thinking it was fate.
Anna, come on... - Don't!
just don't!
grow up, Amish bitch.
this is the real world.
everyone was right about you.
you are a damaged freak.
Yeah, but you're the pathetic whore who came begging for it!
you're hurting me!
mom?
so, Anna's mother was there?
she forgot to tell us about this field trip.
next thing you know, Anna's dead.
wouldn't be the first Christian to kill.
isn't losing my daughter punishment enough?
not if you killed her.
lying to us about being in Philly makes us think you did.
and if I told you, would that have brought Anna back?
your daughter was trying to figure out a lot of things while on rumspringa.
to be or not to be Amish.
tough question to answer at that age.
but it looks like she was starting to figure it out.
I see Mom practically locked in the kitchen, raising seven children, and I don't know if that's what I want from my life.
you were losing her.
you couldn't let that happen.
the example she'd be setting for Sarah, your other daughters...
something Anna used to say:
life is not...
...a dress rehearsal.
I saw that on a... bumper sticker.
I knew Anna would appreciate it.
she was...
everything I wanted to be but couldn't.
she was fearless.
strong.
Anna's death...was my fault.
I should have let her come home.
why did you come here?
I heard Rachel came back, so I went to see her.
and then I was worried about you.
Why?
a woman doesn't have seven babies without knowing what a pregnant girl looks like, Anna.
I thought there was something for me here.
but I was wrong.
I'm coming home with you.
Mrs. Gunden?
do my parents know that you're here?
did they send you?
I thought maybe they were worried or something.
my mom, maybe?
mom? He's talking to you.
Jakob Beachy is in bann.
we are forbidden to talk to him.
good-bye, Mrs. Gunden.
tell my folks I miss them, okay?
this is for you.
it's real sand.
you saw the ocean?
I know you think there's some big world beyond it or whatever, but it was just pretty.
that's all it was.
are you sure?
did you really look?
I don't want you to come home out of fear, Anna.
I've seen people give up.
but never you.
why are you saying these things?
it's like you want me to stay.
I never had the chance.
but there is another world out there.
a world much bigger than...this one.
you just have to really look.
all this time,
I thought she'd found something better.
but I was wrong.
you said Jakob Beachy was banned?
excommunicated.
but still, he'd come back late at nights, on drugs, begging to be let back.
and so the church gave him an ultimatum.
which was what?
or never come back again.
so Jakob gets hooked.
has no idea what to do about it.
what happens when you send your 18th century kid into a 21st century world?
do you want to take a ride?
where we going?
chase some horse and buggies.
fools got me on LoJack?
ain't hard to find someone in your shoes.
easiest place to score in Kensington.
you're a far cry from home, huh, Jake?
my family's from Cuba.
you know where that is?
Yeah, I guess.
guy named Castro takes over, 1959.
throws anyone who objects in jail or worse.
my family's one of the lucky ones.
but no matter how long they've been in this country, it still ain't... home.
you spend New Year's Eve with any Cuban, you hear them give the toast:
next year in Cuba.
but 1959?
you do the math.
been waiting a long time.
you tell me your life story,
I'll tell you mine?
I'm thinking they're one in the same.
I mean you lost your home, your family, everything you've ever known.
I know what that does to a person.
how it makes them feel inside.
lost.
so you pretended to love the English world, but deep down you were scared.
I just want to go home so bad.
they want you to come home, Jakob-- your parents.
they do?
I just talked to them.
they miss you, too.
Yeah, just like Anna's parents miss her.
I didn't mean to hurt her.
she had a chance to get out of this place.
and hear the quiet again.
but she didn't even care.
what's wrong?
Where's your mother?
she went home. - How come you get to go home and I don't?
why don't they love me, too?
I'm not going home.
stop lying.
I changed my mind.
I'm going to do rumspringa the way we're supposed to.
I don't care.
I just want to go home.
you can.
you've just got to quit partying.
I don't know how!
I'm going to go back with you.
you're going to tell my folks I'm better.
you're going to tell them that I stopped doing bad things.
they'll believe you.
I'm not going back. - You have to!
it's the only way! - No, Ja...
stop!
Jakob, I'm going.
get out of my way.
co
stand up!
we're going to go home. We're going to go home.
we're going to go home. No, no...
we're going to go home.
we're going to go home. We're going to go home.
2007/8/20
Ma-two, can I go to record city?
what for?
to buy some more of that hippity-hop mess?
they got this new CD I want.
dinner's almost ready.
and you're spending too much time listenin' to that nonsense as it is.
it ain't nonsense. And I already ate.
on my way home from school.
good, then you can keep me company.
I eat with you every day.
that's a blessing, not a curse.
my home cooking and good company...
something to be envied. Yeah, I know.
if you want to go somewhere, why don't you go down to the church youth center and try to make some friends?
nobody ever says nothin' to me there.
take them headphones off and maybe they will next time.
you gotta learn how to speak up, baby.
you really not gonna let me go?
but we're talkin' about my future, ma-two.
if I start my own label, I can get you a phat crib.
give you the kind of life you deserve.
go set the table, Shemar.
missing PERSONS storage company called this morning, Lil.
management got a complaint about a foul odor, strange leak in one of the units.
freezer shorted. Started leaking fluids.
unis found this inside.
Shemar reynolds. 12 years old.
missing since August.
last seen on his way home from school.
family's probably still hoping for a safe return.
don't they always.
ID'd him pretty fast.
kid's earring helped.
we matched it to missing persons.
slashing his face wasn't enough?
took off his finger.
a souvenir maybe?
takes a lot of rage to do that to a kid.
doer soundproofed this place.
muffled the noise. - Lieutenant.
tracking the name on the unit.
rented to a Theo Gamble.
what is it?
three other storage units in north Philly were rented under that same name.
we got a serial killer.
he killed four kids that we know of.
victim number one.
damont Henderson. Age 12.
last seen at northland mall.
october '99.
next, Kendrick Malone.
nine years old.
left his house to meet friends. July 2001.
never seen again.
number three: Marcus Hollister.
he went missing from his block, march 27, 2003.
and Shemar Reynolds.
the most recent, 12 years old. Disappeared three months ago.
and Missing Persons never raised an eyebrow.
great.
cause of death: He slit their throats.
slashed their faces.
personal-- doing that.
so maybe he knew them.
all different ages, different parts of north Philly.
nothing in common.
they all come from tough neighborhoods.
no way our guy just waltzed in there. Had to be familiar.
took off their left index fingers. Postmortem.
cause not just any finger would do for this crackjob.
the victims sustained shin splints, abrasions under their feet.
they were alive.
their stomachs were empty.
initial stages of starvation.
no signs of sexual assault.
meaning he didn't kill them right away.
so what was he doing with them?
we got a print off the lock on the freezer in Shemar's unit.
running it now.
all the other units were wiped clean. Every inch.
the bodies, too. Not one hair or fiber on 'em.
takes a lot of discipline, care, not leave a trace like that.
what about the name on the units?
Theo Gamble.
ran it through DMV.
guy doesn't exist.
great.
families are here.
Lil, you and scotty talk to the storage managers.
Yeah.
the rest of us talk to them?
before the media catches hold, plasters it all over the news.
waiting ain't gonna make it any easier.
you and damont were at the mall when he went missing?
he didn't want to be seen with his moms anymore.
so he went off on his own.
do you know where exactly?
I waited for him at the usual spot.
damont never showed.
I spoke to detectives. Over the years.
didn't nobody mention to me that there were other boys missing. Why?
they had to know that monster was out there. Didn't they?
says here your son marcus got caught up with a gang.
my son had his troubles, but he wasn't no banger.
the night he went missing he told you he was going to the store?
to get what?
popsicles.
boys and girls club was hosting a science fair.
Marcus needed sticks for a bridge he was building.
could he have stopped somewhere else? - No.
Marcus knew I'd worry and he was anxious to get that bridge done.
I asked this one cop about putting out one of them, uh.
What'd ya call it?
amber alerts.
told me no.
said Marcus probably ran away.
runaway, banger.
all code for one thing.
we don't give a damn.
mall security found my son's jacket near the food court.
it's his favorite.
damont had that toy in his pocket.
someone give it to him?
I think he bought it.
from one of the toy stores?
I don't know.
he was sweet on this girl at school.
his first crush.
it was probably for her.
sounds like a nice kid.
I told him...
I told him he'd have plenty of time to worry about girls when he got older.
some folks on the block helped look for marcus.
found this in a garbage can.
Marcus had it with him that day? - Yeah.
looks like it's been picked through.
nothin' much in it. Just some magazines, tickets.
kids get these at carnivals or those kiddie pizza places.
no carnivals in our neighborhood.
and Marcus would never go anywhere like that without tellin' me.
Shemar disappeared three months ago!
and now you care.
now you wanna ask me questions about my grandson.
now that he's dead.
the more information we have... - I came down to missing persons every single day.
and all I got was some nonsense about how kids run off with their friends to get high.
Oh, he'll come home," they said.
I'm sure that's what they believed at the time.
if you people had given a damn about just one of those boys that disappeared, my grandson would still be alive. Now, wouldn't he?
Yeah, Theo Gamble.
rented that unit in my facility starting back in '03.
pretty memorable this guy?
paid in cash. One year up front.
that don't happen every day.
What'd he look like?
he was black.
mid-30s maybe.
look, I run the kind of place where you don't pay too much mind, you know what I mean?
was he a big guy? Average size, what?
Anything'll help.
all I remember is he was kinda touched.
as in crazy?
he got all bent out of shape over nothing...
Aw, man.
they always lose.
it's a good thing I don't gamble, huh?
all right, unit 3079.
it's at the end.
you, you promised me unit 1925.
they're both the same size.
who cares about the damn number?
you promised me that number!
take it. It's yours.
most folks want a unit that's convenient, at the end of the row or something.
but he cared about the number.
you're damn right he did.
like I said, touched.
look, we're going to need you to talk with a sketch artist.
I told you I didn't see nothing 'cept those ratty gloves.
got a hit on the print off shemar's unit.
whose is it?
multiple assault charges.
weapon of choice: A knife.
get down! Get down!
get on the ground! Get on the ground!
what the hell?
what the hell is this, man?
there a reason for all the fanfare, dawg?
four dead kids reason enough?
I don't know jack about no dead kids.
well, we found one in a storage house not too far from here.
heard it on the news. So what?
ain't got nothin' to do with me.
I been in rehab. You can ask 'em yourself.
you might want to explain what your fingerprint's doing on that lock.
what? Hold up.
I went in there to steal stuff. That's it, all right?
tell it to your lawyer.
Oh, ease up, dawg. Maybe we could work out a trade or something.
Oh, I don't think so, dawg.
listen, I got this video camera.
I lifted it from the storage unit last week.
and trust me, there's something on it you're gonna want to see.
explains the tape on the floor.
he's making the kid stand there.
check out the date stamp.
august 27, 2007.
four days after shemar disappeared.
fast-forward.
made them stand there hours on end.
explains the shin splints, the bruising.
same thing happened to him as a kid?
you know, he's reliving it maybe?
making others go through the pain.
sick bastard, do that to some kid.
made 'em stand until they couldn't anymore.
Wait.Take it back.
think the kid said something.
defector three.
defector three.
what the hell is defector three?
some kind of code?
kid hasn't eaten in four days.
could be rambling. Nonsense.
or a cry for help. - To who?
only one who's going to see it is the doer.
Nah, he's at the end of his rope.
he's desperate.
Yeah. So?
nothin' to lose.
hoping someone else gets this tape besides the doer.
could be he's leaving us a message.
you been up all night with nick, trying to figure out the numbers on the storage units.
why he's fixated on 'em.
tried military code, morse code.
no luck.
it can't be the killing our doer's getting off on.
yeah? Why's that?
murder's not on the tape.
it's not what excites him.
the standing does.
Akon's story checked out.
he was in rehab when two of the victims disappeared.
look at his eyes.
he knows.
knows what?
he's going to die alone.
loneliest thing in the world, that.
defector three. Figured it out.
it's an arcade game.
uh, why did Shemar leave a message about some game?
that's where he met his killer.
toy's made exclusively for those funfare grabber games.
right.
the game with the big claw thing. See 'em at carnivals.
and arcades. Ditto with the tickets.
there's an arcade on Shemar's route home from school.
also in the northland mall where damont disappeared.
and two blocks from marcus's apartment.
all of them had one of those defector three games.
arcade.
perfect place to troll for kids.
let's canvas 'em. Station some unis there, too.
someone might have seen our doer.
no suspicious dudes getting past me.
I got zero tolerance when it comes to safety.
take it seriously. - Got to.
this is the only place where a kid from around here can be a kid.
you remember seeing shemar reynolds here?
few months back?
sure. High scorer.
always had an audience, too.
any of 'em stand out?
new kid.
14, 15 maybe.
never seen him before.
watched your boy Shemar like a hawk.
right over there.
this kid and shemar exchange words?
you could say that.
he eventually got his nerve up to play homeboy.
Ah, don't try that roundhouse kick!
Yeah, boy!
you got lucky.
somebody had to fall in the pit.
I'm just glad it wasn't me.
uh, you talk now, but ain't nobody ever beat me at home.
nobody, and I only play the best.
chumps, all of 'em.
Oh, well, let's see how long you can stand.
what's up? Let's go.
my grams gets all panicked when I don't show on time.
it's just a few blocks down.
uh, if you're scared, just say so.
you crazy?
five bucks says you're about to get another whoopin'.
this kid have a name?
but they both made the board.
the board? What's that?
high score screen.
players' names get put on.
the new kid-- he was #2.
Theseus.
never saw Shemar and that kid again after that.
checked out all the defector three games at the arcades our victims went missing from.
name Theseus shows up on every one of them.
all our victims played him.
Yeah. Kids were pros at that game.
nobody topped their scores for years.
storage unit was rented by an adult, so the kid must be a lure.
got to admit.
it's smart-- our doer using a kid as bait.
so what's the significance of this game he plays?
defector three?
it was a typical rpg.
players force their opponents into the pit.
uh, role-playing game.
Toni's kid plays 'em.
nothing special about this one. Standard fight to the death stuff.
he's picking that game for a reason.
if it has a significance, I'm not seeing it.
the moniker fits, though, with the lure part, at least.
well, how so?
looked up the name theseus.
it's from greek mythology.
theseus is a young man who's sent by his father to do to bad guys what they did to others.
it's a father and son thing.
kid's doing his father's bidding? Twisted.
well, some might believe his dad's righting a wrong.
so the son finds a victim, he convinces them to come and play video games.
dad takes over from there.
the name Theseus showed up on a game in an arcade in brewerytown.
there's another victim out there? - Nope.
this opponent's still alive.
Corey middleton, 11.
well, bring him in for a talk. Maybe he can give us an id.
any luck with those storage numbers?
working on it.
you know, toni's kid, andre, ain't much older than these kids.
I used to go to the arcade when I was little.
you played against someone named Theseus.
you remember anything about him? What he looked like?
he had a playstation.
wanted me to come over and check it out.
and did you, corey?
did you go to his house?
you can tell the truth. You won't get in trouble.
is theseus the guy that hurt those boys they're talking about on tv?
we don't know. That's why we need your help.
I just wanted to play the game.
after this, you come to my spot, hit up my playstation.
which games you got?
all of 'em, but the dopest stick to the basics.
old school.
word. Just like when we were little kids, right?
look out! Look out!
about time for your secret sidearm.
how'd you know about my move?
been watching you. Long time.
watching me play? For real?
got to. I don't play just anybody.
only those who know how to dominate.
wait till you see me on the playstation.
no, man! Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up! No!
thought you were a winner, man.
I usually am.
not today you aren't. You lost.
you wasted my time.
he got real mad.
are you sure the kid you were playing was wearing ripped gloves?
Yeah. Like those ones you use at baseball practice.
same gloves the guy at the storage facility described.
the ones the doer was wearing.
he was pretending, though. That guy.
what do you mean? Pretending?
he had gray hair on his face like you.
gray hair?
our doer isn't using a kid as a lure.
he's impersonating one.
got unis stationed at arcades, malls, rec centers.
anyplace with video games.
community knows we're looking for a guy that passes himself off as a kid.
meaning size ain't one of his strong points.
that's why he has to lure them with the video games.
talk to the families again.
ask them if a kid was hanging around the victims.
Hey, boss. These families want answers.
we keep coming back with more questions.
well, we know theseus played video games as a kid.
yeah,'cause of that "when we were little kids" slip he made with corey.
maybe defector three was one of them.
that game didn't come out till '99.
got to be a reason he chooses kids who play that game.
not just any kids either. Winners.
it's all about domination with this guy.
maybe he's putting them in their place.
could be what those storage units are about.
he's creating his own pit.
I figured it out.
the numbers on the units.
the numbers he rented, insisted on...
I'm thinking they had to be some complicated code.
it isn't. It's simple arithmetic.
they all add up to 17.
stick to the basics." Like he told corey."
he's latching onto these names, numbers and places like he's trying to make sense of something.
what though? And what's the significance of 17?
theseus is all about righting the wrongs.
17's probably a place from his past.
where things went bad.
building, room number, street address.
like I said...
nothing but questions.
you're full of them now.
shame you wasn't around when it might've helped.
ms. Johnson, did Shemar make any new friends before he disappeared?
come to his funeral and you'll find out.
we need your help to stop this guy before he hurts someone else's son.
Shemar was shy.
kept to himself.
been like that since his mama left.
no friends at all?
certainly none that came around here.
what about at the arcade?
Yeah, Shemar met a boy there a couple of weeks before he disappeared.
a Theseus, maybe, or Theo?
Yeah, a strange sort of name.
he put all kinds of notions in my grandson's head.
forgetting something?
Ma-two, can I ask you a question?
of course, baby.
what would happen to me if you died?
you listening to one of those hippity-dippity shoot-'em-up songs again?
I told you all that violence and murder ain't good.
this song ain't like that. - Yeah, sure, it ain't.
it's about the stuff you talk about.
like hope, survival.
you'd like it.
thinking about your mom?
Nah.
you miss her, don't ya?
I was only three when she left.
the only one I remember being there is you.
so why the long face?
this kid I met at the arcade said that boys with no family like him get sent to this hard place that they never get out of ever.
it's called "the pit."
and if you die, then I'm going to go there, too.
Shemar, baby...
I ain't going nowhere.
but what if you did?
your mama left, don't mean I will.
I will always be here to protect you.
I promise.
let's say our prayers.
theseus didn't have a family?
Shemar said he didn't have nobody.
I didn't keep my promise to him, now, did I?
you went to the police every day, asking about shemar.
you tried.
Shemar started calling me "mama" after my daughter belinda left.
you were all he had.
they say,"it takes a village."
but Belinda was always gonna be Shemar's mama.
I never wanted to take that from her. I was just second in line.
that's why he calls you "ma-two."
thank you for your time, Ms. Johnson.
find him.
the man that did this to those babies.
make him pay, you hear?
theseus warned shemar about losing family 'cause he didn't have one.
could've come from an orphanage, foster home, juvenile facility.
a lot of foster care facilities were breeding grounds for delinquents.
but there was one in north philly, notoriously bad.
it was called prichard house, but the residents had a different name for it.
the pit.
that's why defector three.
he was stuck in "the pit" once.
now, he's killing kids who were able to put him there again.
gets better.
Prichard got written up for everything from professional misconduct to health hazards.
but in '86, six kids were treated repeatedly for posterior tibial syndrome, also known as shin splints.
same injuries as our victims.
patients were treated by a Dr. Ben Breslyn.
is he still practicing?
at a clinic in chestnut hill.
the pit, yes.
I treated the kids there and at seven other facilities around the city.
back in '86, six kids came in with these foot injuries:
bruising, shin splints.
detective, that was over 20 years ago.
you don't really expect me to remember it, do you?
six kids? 12 visits in two weeks with the same injuries?
Yeah, I do.
look, I was fresh out of medical school and hell-bent on making a difference.
then it would seem like the kind of thing you'd notice.
you're trained not to.
just get them in and out as quickly as possible.
and I'd been warned.
about what?
they told us these kids would do anything for attention.
so you thought they were faking it?
they didn't have anything to lose by telling a few tall tales.
still, you didn't think it was fishy?
I might have if I had more than five minutes with them.
so you were too busy.
there was one kid.
couldn't have been more than nine or ten, but that look in his eye.
it always stuck with me.
how'd this happen, Malik?
a lot of you boys coming in with these same injuries.
you guys goofin' around jumping off the stairs?
don't want to tell me? Fine.
give this to your counselor. It'll help the pain.
he made us stand in the square.
like that.
who?
Mr. Grimes.
Grimes, the counselor?
must've been standing there an awfully long time.
a few days.
days?
he says when one of us does something bad, we all got to pay the price.
send the next kid in, all right?
don't forget to give that prescription to your counselor.
so grimes was the counselor to all the boys with those injuries?
Yes, night counselor.
former resident, too.
a lot of them came back to work there.
any idea where he is now?
he left in '91.
bounced around to a few other facilities till about '99.
that's the last I heard of him.
99, that's when the killing started.
I'm sorry I didn't do more.
thanks for your time.
Yeah, boss, what is it?
my brother was standing right here the whole time and now he's gone.
I'll call your sergeant.
Tyrell Hobbs, 11 years old.
sister went around the corner to use the atm.
how'd the hell this happen?
we got all the arcades, everything covered.
why is he snatching kids from a pizza joint? - because we missed one.
he knows we're onto him.
must've seen the unis when he was trolling the arcades.
so he finds the one game we weren't watching.
luck of the devil.
he knows time's running out.
probably got a mission to complete.
and he's succeeding.
maybe not, boss.
we got a hit on a storage unit near the pizzeria where Tyrell went missing.
unit numbers adds up to 17.
guy with ripped gloves paid cash upfront a few days ago.
didn't go by theo gamble.
fits the description of our doer.
we got to get down there pronto.
Shemar held on for days. Tyrell may not have that long.
we got the counselor. He's in interview.
no way you're pinning the murders of those north philly boys on me.
you had a nice long run.
eight years.
doesn't take a genius to beat a murder rap, if cops aren't looking.
Oh, you think it's funny?
little boys with their faces sliced open.
you cops act all concerned now that you got some bad press.
need to lock somebody up quick.
and any ol' brother will do.
the jig is up, Grimes.
you got nothing connecting me to those murders and you know it.
we found your storage unit.
we need to open up unit 359 now.
I don't know nothing about no storage unit.
what about the pit?
you should know a lot about that.
the foster care home?
that place shut down in '85.
that's where you first tried out your techniques.
making kids stand for hours on end till they couldn't anymore.
maybe I used some tactics that weren't popular.
popular?
that's an understatement, Grimes.
there were 34 of those billy badasses and only one of me.
I did what I had to keep them in line.
you hated those boys, didn't you?
taught them all a lesson.
I didn't hate them.
I disciplined them.
your brand of discipline was torture.
we talked to dr. Breslyn.
he didn't leave me a choice.
who? - Malik.
I was at my wit's end with him.
he was your first.
I made him stand in the square.
the others, too.
but the runt just wouldn't learn.
you gotta be real tired of standing here, huh, Nalik?
if you learned to sit still, you wouldn't be breaking things all the time.
I told you what I'd do if it happened again, didn't I?
now all the boys in your ward have to suffer.
because when one person does something wrong, we all got to pay!
not you.
was I talking to you?
was I talking to you?
now, if you boys want this to be your last night of standing here like this...
you need to make sure Malik learns his lesson.
clear?
malik learned.
he didn't get in trouble again.
what did they do to him?
what did they do to Malik?
they cut off his finger.
the boys in that bathroom were different ages, just like our victims.
how many boys were in there with Malik?
five.
Tyrell's the fifth victim.
it's endgame.
what was the room number on that bathroom?
how you know it had a number? - What was the number?
don't come near me.
drop the guns... now.
only if you let Tyrell go.
I know why you're here, Malik.
what happened, in this room, to you.
I know.
you got no idea about this room.
about me.
right. You're just some psycho on a power trip.
you ain't better than that.
Oh, you think you know?
a loser... who takes it out on little kids, big man like you.
I am not. - No.
now you call the shots.
you searched for those five boys, all winners, who demeaned you for months, years.
before, you were powerless to stop them, but... not now.
not ever again.
everybody stood in the square because I...said so.
because you're theseus.
righting the wrongs of things done to you in here.
I was the smallest, the weakest, but they didn't care.
they took everything from you.
and now...
I take everything from them.
now if you boys want this to be the last night of standing here like this...
you need to make sure malik learns his lesson.
clear?
they were laughing.
yet Theseus knew his day would come.
that fed him. It was his source of strength.
it gave purpose to his miserable life.
made him invincible. Immortal.
God.
he found them, one by one.
and he did exactly what they had done to him.
those boys wronged you.
they have to pay.
cause you kill the strong, the ones that tormented you in this room.
don't come near me!
you're the strong one, not him.
look. Look, Malik.
Tyrell's just a boy.
like you were.
you hear that? It's over.
put the knife down, Malik.
do you know what happened to Theseus in the end?
Malik... don't!
he rose out of the pit...
a hero.
he did what no else could, and they cheered him on.
welcomed him...
home.
put it down.
it's not over.
<u> "you're Gonna Make It" by kj-52</u>
our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.
these words of Martin Luther King Jr.
hold special import today, as our own lives begin;
as we go forth, past these ivory towers, into a city and a world rife with poverty, with war, and with injustice.
be brave, be fearless...
...and most importantly, be compassionate.
congratulations, Class of 1982...
...we are officially graduated.
ms. Rush... Lily... Ms. Rush... Lily...
we're losing her.
another late night?
too many margarita
gin kills me.
gin? You mean tequila.
I don't make 'em, I just drink 'em.
trouble sleeping, huh?
no, not at all.
you're here early.
anything to get out of PPD.
Jeffries biting everyone's head off?
I won't even step foot into Stillman's office.
when's the boss back?
two more weeks. Counting the days.
and minutes. So, what's up?
kid buried here-- a Mike Delaney.
college type, shot back in '82.
someone vandalized his grave.
the 25th anniversary of his death coming up.
university's doing some kind of memorial service for him?
big man on campus, back in the day.
college police, homicide-- both turned the place inside out.
got nothing-- no suspects, no motives.
hmm-- straight-A student, varsity jock...
president of the local "Meals On Wheels" chapter...
making the rest of us look like lazy-ass good-for-nothings.
had a reputation as a womanizer.
a real Casanova.
every girl on campus wanted him, every guy wanted to be him.
but who'd want to kill him?
maybe her.
original theory ???
university's in the middle of one of Philly's poorest hoods.
lots of tension between the students and the locals.
well, no one heard the altercation, gunfire.
graduation night, everyone's loaded.
security guard found Mike's body the next morning, middle of the quad.
there was a nine-millimeter recovered three blocks from the crime scene...
matched our victim's ballistics.
no prints.
the serial number was filled off, making it untraceable.
no National Ballistics Database back then.
might be able to sniff it out now.
let's run it.
sure, Boss.
we're also looking into the cemetery surveillance footage from this morning-- maybe our tagger got caught on tape.
the trajectory of the bullet indicates the doer was anywhere from five-two to five-four.
well, if the doer's a vigilante rape victim, height could point to a woman.
might've found our tagger.
police report filed back in '82 at West Detectives.
alleged rape naming Michael Delaney as the doer.
who's the victim? - Name's left blank.
the assigned officer was a Maggie Lafferty.
"locked and Loaded" Lafferty.
instructor at the Academy range.
was a real ball-buster.
want us to have a talk?
do you really need me to tell you what to do?
just checking... Boss.
don't call me Boss.
I'm out of here at 5: 00 today, so no dilly-dallying.
you a 5: 00 p. m. man now? That Toni's doing?
Ah, figured I'd set a good example for Andre.
sit-down family dinners.
what?
know what I'm getting you for Christmas
tickets to the ballet.
Ballet?!
Yep. The Nutcracker.
is that the pit bull?
Philly P. D.
would've never guessed, cheap suit and all.
you worked Sex Crimes at West in '82, right, Maggie?
on the line, too. So what?
you handle this job?
I remember the kid, sure.
said a Michael Delaney raped her?
Yep.
nothing I could do.
I thought you were Sex Crimes.
a joke, back in the day.
I had a desk, a phone, that's it.
nobody cared.
not that you'd remember.
you, maybe.
so you sent her away. Nice.
my lieutenant said rape victims were gals that just regretted it the next morning.
my hands were tied.
real door prize, your lieutenant.
men-- can't live with 'em, can't kill 'em off.
drop the battle axe.Talk about the girl.
name was, uh... Tess...Tessie something or other.
scholarship kid from Kensington, working a job in the school cafeteria, raising her kid brother, parents dead.
how'd she run into Delaney?
knew the ass-clown from school.
real charmer, that guy.
gave her a paper rose before he tore her up.
so this Tessie comes in...
and boy, was she a wreck.
don't you think it'd be wise to leave your kid brother home?
I told Jimmy I got robbed, that's why we're here.
he's scared to stay home alone.
so you, uh, knew your attacker?
we went out two nights ago.
so you dated this guy?
we didn't date.
we went out. Once.
and, uh, where'd the rape occur?
in... in my apartment.
he dropped me off after dinner;
he said he had to use the bathroom. Any witnesses to what transpired?
my brother was asleep in the next room.
maybe I should've screamed, woke him up, so he could've witnessed it.
look, you want to press charges, I can do that.
but this is how it's gonna play out.
how much did you have to drink?
what were you wearing?
why'd you bring him home?
I already told you.
do you bring guys up to your place a lot?
are you sexually promiscuous?
get the picture?
and after that, he'll still walk.
I've seen it time and again.
what if he comes back?
what am I supposed to do?
if he breaks in, you can report it.
otherwise, lock your doors.
right.
I'm sorry; I really am.
just give me a second.
when he was done, you know what he said?
you're prettier when you smile.
I'm sorry.
yeah... me, too.
didn't even have a name for date rape back then.
rape shield laws are supposed to protect victims from being crucified on the stand.
game was different if you knew your attacker.
no one saw 'em as real victims.
so Mike rapes this girl, gets off scot-free.
that's justice.
that was the law.
Philly Homicide.
Homicide?!
where were you this morning?
here. Home.
getting ready for work. Why?
got anyone to verify that?
no. I live alone.
what is this about?
does the name Mike Delaney ring any bells?
of course.
he went to my school.
the grave was vandalized this morning.
know anything about that? - Absolutely not.
well, we know what he did to you.
look, I'm late for an appointment.
no one believed you, so you pretended it never happened.
but it did.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do.
what do you want from me? - The truth.
25 years later-- you're kind of late to the party.
understandable, you wanting revenge.
so, in other words, did I kill that bastard?
did you?
graduation day I was home with my brother, so, no.
you didn't go to your own graduation?
I dropped out after it happened and I never set foot on that damn campus again.
you grew up in Kensington.
must've felt lucky to be at that school.
I felt even luckier when "the" Mike Delaney liked me.
Hey!
Hi.
here's the deal:
I'm just gonna say it, so don't think I'm a dope or whatever.
okay...
every night, I see you sitting here, not messing around like the rest of us, or killing time till the bars open, and I'm thinking this girl's different.
special. - Yeah, right.
just hear me out, okay?
because every night, I'm like: "Go over there right now, say the perfect thing...
but I know whatever it is, she'll just think it's some dumb pick-up in a library.
not yet, I don't.
you think I should give it a shot?
go for it.
I'm gonna do it then.
okay? You ready? Here it comes.
would you have dinner with me?
I bought his crap, hook, line and sinker.
you were young, he was good.
I had nightmares about it for months afterward.
I would wake up terrified thinking he was in my room.
thought I was going crazy.
must have been awful.
and that's why you dropped out?
I got a job and I put my brother through college.
at least one of us graduated.
if that's it, can I go?
Yeah.
if you find who killed him...
give 'em a medal.
guys like Delaney make it hell for the rest of us.
your point?
my point is, sometimes women say no when they don't mean it 'cause if they didn't, they'd be thought of, you know...
hos?
digging that ditch deeper.
I would never call a woman a "hos."
all I'm saying is what's a guy to do, back off at the first no?
human race would go extinct.
no means no.
how many ways you need that spelled out?
the name of the game is pursuit.
you run, I chase.
you ain't chasing me anywhere.
we follow up on Tess' alibi or what?
it checked out. Doesn't mean the brother isn't lying.
cause "no" means "yes.
enough, both of you.
I think I found something
Mike's yearbook.
Mike gave Tessie a rose when they met, we know that.
there are more roses, more girls.
there must be ten women there.
could be other victims or maybe women he was zeroing in on.
saying we got a serial rapist?
saying we got a new pool of targets.
and any one of them could have killed him.
are these the other women from Mike's yearbook?
Yeah. Picked 'em all up at the library.
same BS with the paper rose.
one of the girls we couldn't bring in-- Shaina McNulty.
she lawyer up?
Nah, she put a bullet in her head a few months before Mike was killed.
she was 18.
rush and Miller are doing the interviews.
figured female cops should talk to them.
meanwhile, us jerk male cops got the security footage from the cemetery.
only visitor yesterday morning, only one who could have vandalized Mike's grave.
can't make heads or tails.
I'll show it to the groundskeeper.
the girls' yearbook photos, too.
might jog his memory.
so why do we even care about this job?
the guy got what was coming to him, in my book-- community service murder.
damn right.
cause we're murder cops.
go do your jobs.
Mike didn't rape me.That's ridiculous.
you dated him, though.
once. We had nothing in common.
we went our separate ways.
end of story.
did you have sex with him?
that's really none of your business.
did you say no?
well, that's what you're supposed to say, right?
can't be too easy.
is that what you think, you were easy?
I'd had too much to drink.
so it's your fault what he did?
maybe it was.
maybe I shouldn't have brought him up to my room.
I think I had too much wine.
me, too.
um, I'm still a virgin, Mike.
me, too.
seriously, I, I don't want to.
what are you doing?! What'd you think was gonna happen?!
no... no... Please don't! No! Please...!
I was sending mixed signals, I guess.
no, you were pretty damn clear.
what does it matter now?
did you kill him, Melinda?
I wasn't raped, okay?
I wasn't some victim.
in college, I was on top of the world.
head of my sorority, dating 24-7, big-time party girl.
and then you met Mike.
after two dates, I was planning our wedding in my head.
pathetic, huh?
you liked him.
he said I was different, special.
right.
you ever tell anyone what he did?
the morning after it happened, I tried to tell my best friend.
Oh, my God.
you guys totally did it.
I don't want to talk about it.
tore this off you.
Mike's a total animal.
give it back, Lisa. Come on!
what's wrong, Kar?
he raped me.
what?
we were kissing, and then... he changed.
come on, Kar.
a guy like Mike doesn't need to rape anyone.
I mean, you wanted to do it with him, right?
yeah... right.
let's just hope he calls.
I just always wondered why he did it.
I liked him, you know?
he didn't have to force me.
where were you the night he was shot?
Oh, please, I didn't kill him.
I didn't even press charges.
why not? - I was the party girl, okay?
I knew what everybody would say.
I didn't want to be raped all over again.
a lot of anger keeping your secret bottled up.
anger?
you wouldn't know the half of it.
a guy like Mike deserved what he got.
damn right he did.
maybe you got even.
I wanted to, believe me.
saw him on campus everywhere weeks after.
always with that damn smile.
Hey, pretty lady.
screw you.Get away from me.
I know. You're mad I haven't called.
you son of a bitch.
you know damn well what happened! I said no!
but you didn't mean it...did you?
Hey!
I told the dean and he promised to look into it.
next thing you know, Mike's giving a valedictorian speech.
hmm. And you knew he'd never pay.
the 25th anniversary of his death-- boo-hoo.
you were the one who wrote "rapist" on his grave, weren't you, Regie?
I got pregnant after.
I took care of it on my own.
never told a soul.
so, yeah, I did.
fine me.
the world had to know what he did to you...to the others.
others?
how many were there?
did you kill him, Regie?
no, but I'm glad somebody stopped him...
since you people never did.
can I come in?
what the hell you want?
the rape victim who offed herself, Shaina McNulty?
found something.Turns out she used her dad's nine-mill to do the deed.
same make and model that killed Mike.
so maybe dad found out about the rape?
figured that's why his little girl killed herself.
went looking for justice.
dirty Harry style.
you owned a nine-millimeter Smith & Wesson back in '82, Mr. McNulty.
same kind of gun that killed Mike Delaney.
and my little girl.
can't blame you for offing that bastard. I would have, too.
no way he's getting away with it.
I didn't believe her.
Shaina told you what happened with Mike?
and I told her that nice girls don't bring boys up to their rooms.
that's... what I said.
hard knowing the right thing to say.
Shaina shut down right before my eyes.
stopped eating, holed up in that damn dorm room.
I thought it was a phase.
she'd grow out of it.
then I got the call.
where is Shaina?
Mr. McNulty, sir, you can't go in there.
where is she?!
why didn't anyone try and stop her?
why didn't you help my little girl?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
if I had just believed her maybe Shaina would still be here.
Mr. McNulty, you sure you saw that female cop in her dorm room?
I never forgot her face.
like she'd seen a ghost.
she had a book, one of Shaina's.
her diary.
can we take a look at it?
I think they kept it, the cops.
had to pack up her room and her stuff.
they didn't even clean up the blood.
we'll give you a minute, Mr. McNulty.
didn't stop Mike when she had the chance.
so maybe she takes the law into her own hands.
don't call her Locked 'n Loaded Lafferty for nothing.
turns out it matched a nine mil used in an '81 North Philly robbery.
same year you were working Evidence.
gun disappeared shortly after.
you gotta be kidding.
Yeah.
we're a barrel of laughs here.
save the smartass remarks for the civilians.
cause you're a cop. Right side of the law.
you want to take me in, girlfriend, go for it-- I'm calling my F. O.P. lawyer.
so you found Shaina McNulty's diary.
realized Mike raped her, too.
your fault, that kid eating her gun-- you could have stopped him.
I went to the DA, right?
told him I had two vics and a serial rapist on my hands.
he said I had no witnesses, no evidence, no case.
so you took care of business. Your own way.
our job is to protect the victims.
sometimes you gotta bend the rules.
more than bend the rules.
you went off the reservation, Lafferty.
damn right I did.
nothing was gonna stop that guy except a Smith and Wesson.
so you tracked him down.Took him out.
no.
but I did what I had to do.
so I was thinking we'd treat ourselves to a flick tonight.
we got movie money, Tessie?
Hey, don't worry about it, okay?
you're 12, geez, think about girls or something.
that, uh, robbery...
we might have found your wallet.
put the ice cream away, Jimmy, before it melts.
I'll wait for you, Tess.
go up, already.
I'll be there in a minute, okay?
okay.
been, uh, thinking about what you said.
him coming back.
got the right to defend yourself.
Yeah, I remember. Lock my doors.
other ways to do it.
know what I mean?
he comes at you, it's called imminent danger.
the DA'll never charge you.
you're telling me...to kill him.
that would be, uh, unethical of me as a cop.
just informing you of your rights is all.
mail's piling up.
might want to check your box.
you gave her the gun that killed Mike Delaney.
get off the high and mighty, will you?
system wasn't gonna protect victims like her, I had to.
by telling her how to commit a felony.
82 was a long, long time ago.
my memory's kind of fuzzy.
well, we'll subpoena you. Put you on the stand.
you try to take that kid down, you'll get nothing from me.
saying you're gonna lie in court?
saying I don't remember squat, so don't hold your breath, Goldilocks.
you want to question Tessie, I need to be present.
and you are?
my brother. Also my lawyer.
fine.
have a seat.
we know Sergeant Lafferty gave your client a gun.
same one that was used in the murder of Mike Delaney.
and this witness is willing to testify to that?
I didn't think so.
I know what it's like. The nightmares.
making you relive what happened, over and over.
is that a question or a monologue?
and until you tell someone what really happened, the nightmares won't stop.
believe me, Tessie.
I know.
he used me...like a...
toilet.
you don't have to talk to her.
and every time he smiled at me, I was right back on that kitchen floor, and...
his smell...
my client's done talking.
no, no, we're not done here. - Oh yeah, we are.
Yeah, you killed him, didn't you, Tessie?
Oh, I wanted to. - Tessie, shut up.
nightmares won't stop, till you tell me what you did.
tell me.
we're done here.
justifiable homicide, you ask me.
I hear that. Loud and clear.
moot point. Struck out on this one.
nice try, Lil.
Yeah. Way to go, Lil.
it's not our jobs to decide which murders we like or don't like.
Nah, our job is to put away some kid for doing the right thing.
so we let every vigilante walk? That what you're saying?
saying, maybe let this one.
well, I need to talk to her again.
not gonna happen. She's lawyered up.
what is it with you and this case?
why do you even care about that scumbag?
it's not about him.
then what?
cause I can't figure out why you're wasting our time.
there's got to be a way to talk to her, right, Boss?
go home, Lil.
all of you. Please.
quite a spread you got here, John.
Hey. Wasn't expecting you.
Hey.
so how's it going back at the ranch?
say we take her out, hit the high seas, come back next year.
that bad, huh?
well, chasing our tails on this one.
doer's gonna walk. Rush won't let it go.
well, she's got good instincts, Will.
let her follow them.
sometimes being the boss means staying out of their way.
I'm done playing peacemaker.
I'm not cut out for it.
we need you back, John.
I got 31 years on the job, Will.
maybe it's time to have a life.
Ah, sunstroke talking there.
I think I've lost my taste for it.
the politics, or the job?
there a difference?
doing some reading?
Shaina's diary.
a few months before she killed herself, this entry:
I know I'm not alone "in my pain."
there are others who wrote on The Wall.
he won't get away with what he did.
Shaina knew about the other girls?
sounds like it.
so what's this "wall" they wrote on?
place on campus where they could leave messages.
well, we know he picked up his victims at the library.
maybe there?
no internet chat rooms back in '82.
a bulletin board maybe?
some place girls could communicate... privately.
like a bathroom stall?
old school chat room.
for men and women both.
worth following up?
do it.
you coming, Will?
glad you asked.
I always wondered what you ladies had in here.
everything you got.
not quite.
think they'd clean up this stuff, time to time.
got it.
I told my dad and he said it was my fault.
Shaina. - There's more.
other girls.
I told the Dean...
...and nothing happened.
I told the cops...
...and nothing happened.
he raped me, too.
I told my roommate, and she said I asked for it.
Karin wrote that.
he raped me too and I never told anyone...
he raped me, too, and I never told anyone 'cause it was my fault.
they lied.
they knew about each other.
and they made a plan.
to kill him.
got Karin and Melinda here, too.
one of them's gonna break.
you want to make a deal, now's the time.
I didn't kill Mike Delaney.
you did it together.
with Tessie, too. We know that.
that is ridiculous.
writing on the wall says different, Regie.
remember now?
I told you.
I wasn't raped.
your handwriting gonna match the wall, Melinda?
that was just... stupid writing.
it didn't mean anything.
sure it did.
then Shaina killed herself.
you had to make him pay.
I never even met her.
no matter how much I try, I just want it to end.
I hope you won't be mad at me.
I'm just not as strong as you.
Shaina's last entry in her diary.
it was dedicated to you.
the women on The Wall.
she was barely 18.
a kid.
it isn't fair what he did to her.
what he did to all of you.
so you made a plan together.
waited on the quad till nightfall.
please, stop this.
and then you saw him-- alone.
coming from a party?
or maybe another girl's room?
no one was going to stop him.
except us.
he had that stupid smile on his face.
always that damn smile.
but then he saw us.
and he knew.
it was...
...payback time.
say what you did to us.
what is this? - You can't pretend it didn't happen-- what you did to all of us.
Why? Why'd you do it?
I didn't do anything.
you raped us.
right. You're crazy.
say it.
I don't have to listen to this.
say it.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
say it.
Tessie, what are you doing? Huh?
say it, you son of a bitch.
say what you did?
say it!
he wet his pants.
that little piece of crap wet his own pants.
how does it feel, huh?
kill him. - Oh, my God, Tessie, don't.
please... - Kill him, Tessie, now, do it.
okay, okay, okay.
okay, I did it.
say it!
I raped you.
okay?
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, please... please don't shoot me.
please...
I can't.
what? Kill him now, Tessie, do it!
I won't do it.
I won't become him. - Let's go home.
please, Tessie.
let's go home.
then we left him there.
we went back to my dorm room and stayed there until dawn.
and that's when we heard. He was dead.
I was glad.
thought it would make us better.
but it didn't.
you were together until the next morning?
all of you? Even Tessie?
no one left that room until we got the news.
then why'd Tessie's brother lie?
said she was with him that night.
cause he was her alibi.
and she was his.
my client isn't saying another word.
this isn't about your client.
trajectory of the bullet indicates the shooter was five-four, five-two, average sized female.
or a 12-year-old boy.
real protective, weren't you, Jimmy?
parents were dead...
making you the man of the family.
you people are pathetic...
Tessie, don't talk to them.
kids know more than we think.
hear things, see things.
bottle it all up inside.
but it's killing you.
he was just a kid.
this is ridiculous.
tell them, Jimmy. You were home, right?
right?
I saw him.
leave the apartment.
I saw... everything.
okay, I killed him. I did it. Arrest me.
he wasn't sorry.
on the quad.
I followed you that night.
I was supposed to protect you...
Jimmy, shut up!
I am confessing, okay? I killed that animal.
no, you didn't.
Jimmy, don't do this.
I picked up the gun...
stupid bitches...
whores...
then what happened?
I had to protect you, Tess.
please don't do this to him.
he was just a little boy.
don't do this to us, not again.
you picked up the gun because you were scared.
you thought you were in danger.
imminent danger, didn't you, Jimmy?
is she doing what I think she's doing?
didn't you...
I'm not hearing it. You?
tell them yes, Jimmy.
you picked up the gun because you thought you were in danger.
Jimmy, do it for me, please.
just tell them the truth.
tessie's little brother?
Jimmy, right?
she told me about you.
come on, bud, give me the gun.
so what you're saying then is he came at you, right?
grown man coming at a 12-year-old boy, who knows what he'd do?
threat to your life.
say yes, Jimmy. Please.
I know what you did to her. ToTessie.
you got it all wrong, buddy.
no, she said no.
they all say that.
but they don't mean it.
you'll see one day.
I was there. I heard everything.
between you and me, kid?
your sister was one hell of a lay...
shut up!
then he moved in for you, right?
left you no choice.
you know the law.
you won't go away for defending yourself.
because you had to shoot, didn't you, Jimmy?
you're all I got left.
tell them.
I couldn't let him hurt you ever again...
Hey, we're running out of sun.
come on, let's play. - Let me finish.
Oh, hi Skip.
Oh, that's a good one, son.
you even got the robin's nest. - Thanks, ma.
where is dad? - Uhm, working late I suppose.
and now a news update.
yesterday Japan continued its attack along Mount Samat.
the US Philippine divisions suffered heavy losses.
Oh my God. - God.
sorry I'm late sweetheart.
how can we afford a new car?
the bank's just credited us a loan for two new stores.
it's called franchising. - I thought they said no.
I went to the old backup plan.
the backup plan being "don't give up"?
never fails. - This is a Packard!
Yup, gonna drive you to art classes in style.
Hey, what do we have here?
some fat heads at school.
blamed me for Pearl Harbor.
we're as American as those boys.
did you sack 'em back?
I thought fighting was bad. - It is.
but standing up for yourself is another thing, son.
don't forget that.
give it a touch Mr. T?
absolutely Skip.
come on, huddle up, Billy. You too honey. Let's go.
skip, you're going down.
come on. You stay away there, Skip.
alright, let's do this. Ready?
team!
never seen such a swollen-looking center.
what are you doing after the game, hot-kicks?
wouldn't you like to know! - Dad, come on!
al right. Hike!
dad?
all Japanese persons, both alien and non-alien will be...evacuated by noon on April 7th 1942.
what do they mean, alien and non-alien?
they mean us.
court that bad?
coffee there makes this stuff gourmet.
last day of boss's suspension.
jeffrey said he's putting in his retirement papers.
any word on who would be coming in? - Not Jeffries.
some clown from West. Been reassigned six times.
I didn't know what I'd do if I didn't come here every day.
some things I'd miss, some things I wouldn't.
like... court.
all pains in the ass those A.D.A's.
Yeah, real pains.
oil and water. Cops and Lawyers.
usually, that is.
more like 24/7.
excuse me, are you detectives? - Yeah.
my father, Raymond Takahashi, was killed in 1945.
they never caught who did it. - It's sixty-plus years ago.
a long time.
I just found a 20, 000-dollar check from the government...issued to my mother in the 1990. - Tax refund?
restitution.
my family was...at the Manzanar relocation center.
Manzanar? What's that?
a camp in California where they held Japanese-Americans during World War II.
an internment camp. - I was born there.
never knew it, my mother was too ashamed to tell me.
so, what's that gotta do with your father's murder?
my father was killed a few months after we got out and moved to Philly.
maybe the police were looking in the wrong place for his murder.
maybe, eh?
I found this old picture, of my parents and my big brother Billy.
he died in the war.
the way she smiled at them...
she never looks at me like that.
I'd love one chance to meet the woman in that picture.
we'll take a look. Can't promise we'll find anything - I understand.
thank you.
so... the guy survived being locked up in an internment camp.
only to be killed in the City of Brotherly Love.
body found a few blocks from the old municipal stadium.
night of the Army-Navy football game.
he was beaten, pushed down a flight of stairs, broke his neck.
the theory was some drunk bigget roughed him up.
took things to far.
all of two interviews were grow hard on this one.
cause a Jap's a Jap, right?
ray's family lived in California until FTR banned all Japanese-Americans from the West Coast in 1942.
one hundred thousand were forced in the camps without do process.
most were born and raised there.
and none were ever arrested for espionage.
ray's son, Billy, gave up his life for the American dream.
died overseas on 1944.
were founds an empty envelope on Ray's body.
addressed to him in Manzanar.
return address just says APO 513.
army post office. How we used to get our mail home.
the letter could be from his kid Billy.
not likely. It was mailed November 27th, 1944.
Billy died October 13th.
an envelope, no letter.
contents could be a motive.
so, what's the letter writer hiding? Something that happened in Manzanar?
let's strike down all the records we can get from there and...have Laitens take a look.
good luck in the print off for sixty-year old envelope.
boss was military too. Might have some input.
you'll have better luck with the print.
Thanks.
quiet gettin' to you?
I am not much of a cook, frankly. - Right.
you're here for the chili?
no... for a job.
a Japanese-American camp internee killed in '45.
the night of the Army-Navy game.
my father was at that game.
proud Army Man. - It must have broke his hearth.
you're going Navy. - Ah! You got over it.
eventually.
found this on our victim's body,
apo is the only clue to who sent it.
Oh, have Laitens take a look.
I'm sure Jeffries already told you that.
our victim's son, Billy, died in the war, he was an army guy.
442nd?
all Japanese-American unit.
most decorated of the time, for its size.
could use your eyes on this one, boss.
I put my papers in the ready though. You know that.
so, what are we supposed to do without you kickin' our asses?
you'll survive.
enjoy your chili.
why did you bring this stranger, here, Barbara?
you know I don't wanna talk about it. - It's been 62 years, mom.
isn't it time you did? - You recognize this... Mrs Takahashi?
no. - Your husband had it when he was killed.
do you know anyone in the Army who might have sent it? - No.
quite a picture. You draw that?
my son did. Billy.
that's him with his best friend Skip, from home.
I heard about your son's unit, the 442nd.
not many have. - Real heroic guys.
the war was supposed to make us equal.
it didn't. - Because... you were in the camps.
it's okay to talk about it, mom. - What difference does it make.
solving your husband's murder?
maybe Manzanar have something to do with it. - Why?
we were just a number, no names. 8108, like criminals.
did you make any enemies here?
from the moment we arrived.
let's go, get out, let's go, right now.
okay, sir. - Come on, quickly, quickly, ome on, right here.
right here, in the line, right here, let's go, get your things.
come on, right here, let's go, come on, move it.
how long are we going to be here for? - Not too long.
it's for our own protection.
then why are the guns pointed at us?
Billy, we'll just sit tight, be good citizens and won't be out of here , understand?
name, Sir? - Takahashi.
you will be in block 18 room 7, with the Watsanabi family.
we have to share? - At least we'll be together.
mattresses. Down the way you can fill them with straw.
how's the school here? I bet you folks didn't know you got a young Rembrandt visiting.
are you an artist? - I guess.
me too. I teach a painting class. It's gonna be fun.
I made this. So that you don't forget you're Americans.
just wanted to give you some sort of welcome. - Your smile is welcome enough.
I have seen nothing but frowns all day. The sun's still shining.
don't understand? - They're messing with you, Mary Anne?
no, Larry, it's okay.
I don't know why they let you people in this country.
I was born here.
and you got cousins in the old country, fighting for the Emperor?
Scholz. That german?
your cousins fighting for Hitler? - You watch it, Mister.
pick it up. I said pick it up, Jap.
you know the funny thing about wars, kid?
they always find a way to end.
we will meet outside this fence, one day. - Count on that.
Yeah.
but this guard, he headed out for your husband.
Patroled the camp, gun at a ready, looking for trouble.
he and Ray ever had another running? - Not that I know of.
I found our guard, Larry Scholz.
shipped out in Manzanar on '43. Stationed in Italy, till the end of the war.
a rock-solid alibi if I ever heard of one. - Not quite.
he got a medal on the 1945 Army-Navy game, here in Philly.
the same night Ray was killed. - Maybe they met up again.
Larry's side of the world needed one less Jap.
cause keeping them in prison wasn't enough.
we were at war. They'd have done the same to us, if you were in Japan.
would you feel the same if it was your family?
so where is Larry Scholz's current place of residence?
veterans Army Hospital at Virginia.
there's a five hour drive.
shame I got all this paperwork. - Shame I'm still on hold.
have fun, sweet talking. Tollbooth Tennence.
Yeah.
Philly P. D. We're here about Ray Takahashi.
Taka what? - Hashi.
Takahashi. He was at Mazanar internment camp in 1942.
under you watch. - Murdered in '45.
witness think you had a beef with him. - Beef?
you kidding me? I was just doing my job.
we were at war. - Imprisoning our own citizens, yeah.
that make sense. - Saying you wouldn't think twice about sitting on a plane next to an arab after 9/11?
come on.
you sent this to Ray, all overseas?
never seen that before in my life.
look close. - I'll look all you want.
I didn't send that letter to some enemy out of state. - Hated the guy, didn't you?
kept tabs on him at camp, sure.
part of my duties. - How long did you watch Ray for?
until I realizes his old ball and chain was keeping him too busy to make any trouble.
you're drawing me another pretty Blue Jay?
sure, ma.
I was about to look at the bulletin of Japanese-American enlistment.
does it mean we can leave? - Oh, no.
it means you can enlist, son? - Enlist?
prove as American as the rest.
you're gonna make a great soldier. I know you got it in you.
this why I'd be fighting for?
Billy. - What did I say on the first day, dad?
private 8108, part of the duty. - This is just temporary.
we have to act right to prove ourselves?
don't say we don't belong here. - I'm not going.
what the hell is the matter with him?
we've been acting right for a year already in this place.
the whole contry is making sacrifices, we have to play our part.
we're living in a shack.
standing in lines for food like baggers we have lost everything we worked for.
open your eyes, Ray, for once.
wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, come on.
calm down, Evelyn! You love those plates.
I'm pregnant.
what?
you are?
that's fantastic.
I can't... raise a baby in a place like this.
not as a prisoner.
didn't have hit him or harass him after that.
real sweet of you, Larry.
where were you the night of the army navy game? - Getting my medal.
ask Truman. - Ceremony didn't last all night.
talk to my commanding officer, he's right down the hall.
in the president suite.
Larry Scholz's lieutenet confirmed his alibi. - A real gold prize, that guy.
forgot your file, Lil.
good to see you.
just droppin' and off. - Any thoughts on who sent the envelope?
I talked to my military contacts about it.
the army post office number came from a French hospital.
no army examiner stamp. - Meaning...
meaning it didn't go through inspection. It came from an officer.
Thanks.
gotta go. Good luck.
just droppin' something off... - Right.
Mazanar logs. One visitor in the three years Ray was there.
skip Robertson, Billy's friend.
makes sense he would visit. - Turns out Skip was also Billy's lieutenent.
injured in the same battle that killed Billy and friends.
could be our letter writer. - So what's he hiding?
appreciate you driving out from Jersey, Skip.
Oh, please, call me Eugene.
recognize this hand writing? - Yeah, it's mine. Where did you get it?
ray Takahashi had it...when someone pushed him down a flight of stairs...the night of the army-navy game in 1945.
ray Takahashi was murdered? - You that someone Skip?
give him a push?
probably were intown for the game, right?
I was with my army buddies all night, and I can give you names.
do that.
listen, Billy was my best friend and the Takahashis were like family to me!
look... After Billy died I was sent to the South Pacific and we lost touch.
what was in the envelope?
it was the last letter Billy wrote before he died.
I found it in his things and sent it to his family.
what did it say? - I don't know!
listen, Billy was a brave soldier. They all were the 442nd.
Mmh... Billy didn't seem like your average gung-ho soldier.
he didn't want to enlist. And that broke Ray's heart. And that's the reason Ray asked me to come visit.
I just can't wait to get overseas and let those Nazis have it.
your parents must be so proud.
your dad says you're not joining up.
no matter what we do, we'll always be Japs to them.
Hey, you don't fight for this country, you make them right about us, Billy.
what do you know about fighting?
what? - When you socked that guard, dad.
you're supposed to stand up for yourself. - You are, but things aren't so simple now.
not in this world.
they treat us like dirt, here.
how can you ask me to fight when you won't?
you've been telling the boys in the block to enlist? - You stay out of it, Shinji.
no, you stay out! This country treats our children...like cage animals! - Lower your voice...
the guards will hear you and send you away. - Guards!
you know what this is? Toilet paper! Guess what we are.
Hey!
did he do this?
don't ask me that, guard. - I'll ask what I want, tojo.
did this man desecrate the American flag?
Yes.
you worthless traitor!
you have my boy's blood on your hands. This isn't over, Ray, this isn't over!
our kids! Think about it! Our kids!
I'll never forget the look on his face. Like Billy abandoned him.
you know if Shinji and Ray clashed again after that?
now, Shinji was sent off to Tula Lake that day for desecrating the flag.
I saw him leave myself.
looking into the 1945 murder of Ray Takahashi. Name ring a bell?
we lived in that rat hole they called the detention center.
so What? - The Menzanar was no picnic.
tule Lake was even worse. - Long interrogations, cold weather, stockades, you put up with a lot.
all because Ray Takahashi pinned you for a flag burner.
then Ray ends up dead in same city you set your residence in.
coincidence?
a lot of us came here after the war because of the quakers.
they helped us get back on our feet.
my wife and I stuck.
y'know, a guy like that, a traitor...sends me away from my family...
I'd be pretty pissed off.
so maybe you get out of the Tula Lake, swore to find your buddy Ray.
I was still behind barbed wire when Ray died.
didn't get out of Tula Lake through '46
cause I answered no twice to the government loyalty questionnaire.
a loyalty questionnaire?
asked if we'd be willing to fight in the war.
renounce the Japanese Emperor.
Ah! - And you refused to?
didn't know the damn Emperor's name.
I was born here! Just like you!
as far as the government was concerned...
I was just a Jap.
and so was Ray.
but he still couldn't see it.
hey Ray!
you done for the day? - Uh, almost.
I've been reading up on your home town, Philadelphia.
I understand the quakers have quite a presence there.
we do.
maybe when this... business is over...
you could help me introduce me to some folks? - Of course.
I can help you find an apartment. - I appreciate it.
Ah, wait. I've something for you.
carrots. For your Victory Garden.
you and Billy can buy at them. - Thanks.
buy them on my own, today. - Oh, busy with classes?
busy bliming me for the all war. - It's that age.
he doesn't want to enlist. Doesn't believe in dying for this country.
doesn't make me a better American if part of me believes in that too?
no, not in this place.
I always tought I'll be judged on my character, not my skin.
I was wrong. - Ray... you have to know...
I never saw you as the enemy.
it's not fair that you have to start over.
I've been starting over my whole life. Easy as pie.
Thanks. - For what?
you make me forget about where we really are.
you make me forget too.
so, Ray and the quaker were doing the dirty?
the man preached loyalty on his soul box, but he wasn't loyal.
at least not to his wife.
thanks for your time.
so, Mary Ann helped Ray move to Philly. Continue the affair?
or not, the affair wouldn't found out?
don't ?? betrayed wife, nothing worse than a womans scorn.
how about two?
ray Takahashi? Haven't heard that name in 60 years.
well, we're investigating his murder. - Weren't you two pretty close? ??
acquaintances at best.
that all? Mary Ann?
what are you implying? - That you killed him.
when he won't leave his wife for you.
you think I killed my husband? And I wanted to raise a child on my own?
in that era, better is to be a widow than a divorcee?
Yes. Easy.
or first Ray has an affair with a white woman, next he's ollying you and the baby around the country to her home town.
talk about a slap in the face. I'd be angry.
I was barely 25, young, fullish...
so you turned to Ray for some desert loving.
men like Ray... are rare. Special.
what we were doing to them was wrong.
you fell in love. - No.
we had that one kiss, that's all.
he said his wife was the only woman he could ever love.
objection on that? Kind of hurt?
of course I was angry.
ray told her I was the only woman he could love.
and you believed him? - Ray was a gentleman.
we never spoke of it again.
did his wife find out about it?
I didn't realize my one small indiscretion would destroy his family.
what are you doing? - Joining up.
you're just going to leave, without saying goodbye, not even to your mother?
I said goodbye to her. - What about me?
you? You talk about being American?
about liberty and truth?
but you're the biggets liar here! - What are you talking about?
you and that school teacher... Everyone knows.
you don't understand. - What?
things aren't so simple, now? Was that your excuse for mom, too?
you wanna be a soldier, fine. But do it for the right reasons. This isn't about me.
sure it is.
it's about taking a bullet for a Country that's turned you into a coward, that's called me a Jap since I can remember.
you don't know what it's like. - Don't I?
I've been called every name in the book, treated like dirt, and I had to smile in the face of it, but I've never let that destroy me, make me run away, like you are now, son. Don't go.
not like this.
too late.
you do not walk away from me, damn it!
I want...
I want you to...
I want...
I want you to come home safe, son.
home?
I don't have a home.
not anymore.
we got the news about Billy a few months later.
and they never got a chance to make peace?
but I made sure that Ray took me up on the offer of the job and the apartment.
that was the least I could do. - Because you were the reason Billy enlisted?
you got your apartment because of Mary Ann's...
generosity? - If living that hell meant taking advantage of a crush some... silly woman had on my husband, then so be it.
any mother would have done the same.
for Barbara?
and for my son.
I wanted him to come home to a real home.
not one behind bars.
but he never got that chance.
and we'll leave in a big train and you'll get to feel cool air instead of this...
dusty, cold wind.
trying to be here soon.
I stopped by the woodworking hut.
I've been...
I've been making these for you, to replace what we had.
Plus, the next time you'll get mad at me, they won't break.
I guess it's time for the back up plan.
don't give up? - Don't give up.
on us.
you're my own life, you're the only thing that kept me going, here.
we use 'em in Philadelphia, in our new home, when Billy returns, the four of us.
the four of us?
I like the sound of that.
it's time to go.
ray, what is it?
that's how they told us our son was dead.
in a telegram.
I'm sorry.
it breaks my heart that Ray and Billy died angry at each other.
it broke Ray's too.
we weren't the only family that got a telegram that day.
shinji's family got one.
the neighbor who went to Tule Lake? His son was in the Army?
one of the first to enlist.
Ray... talked him into it.
all right, I got Shinji's Tule Lake records.
alibi check up? - No.
shinji wasn't realesed in 1946 like he said.
got out on november 23rd, 1945.
a few days before Ray was killed. - Even better.
he used a train ticket the government bought him... to head to Philly.
but his wife was in California.
and you don't travel 3, 000 miles just to say hello.
you have blood on your hands, convincing our boys to fight. This isn't over.
wasn't just any blood Ray had on his hands, it was your son's.
my son would've done anything to prove he was American.
he got his wish. - But doesn't change the fact that you were in Philadelphia when Ray was murdered.
see? We make our threats too.
checked the record at Tule Lake. - 25 bucks and a ticket to Philly.
I came here to see Ray, but I didn't kill him. - Then why lie?
frankly? Not a lot of faith in the American justice system.
point taken. Doesn't answer the question.
I came here to give him Billy's letter.
they were long gone when the letter got to Manzanar.
didn't realize you two were Bosom Buddies. - We weren't.
but Ray paid the same price I did to this Country.
a son.
he deserved to have that letter.
and I had a question to ask him. - What question?
how to go on.
but it was clear, he no longer had any answers for me.
what are you doing here?
this letter came to Manzanar after you left. My wife wanted to make sure you got it.
I don't want anything from that place.
it's from Billy.
Billy's gone.
they're saying they can't send my boy's body home, for at least another year.
do you know what I'd do for a letter? Anything, from him?
they already tore it down, the camp.
like it never existed.
my son died for a country that tosses us out seems like the kitchen garbage.
I'm not surprising they don't remember our boys names.
they were heroes.
and this country should give our boys the medals they deserve.
can they bring him back to me, Shinji?
can they do that?
shinji, wait! Shinji!
he said he was going to give Billy his medal.
change his mind, just like that?
after he read Billy's letter...
that's why he was ahead at the stadium,
Army-Navy.
ray wasn't giving up the Distinguish Black Medal that night.
Billy deserved the medal, and your son did too.
threw himself on a granade to save his batallion.
one brave kid.
his dad's last wish was to see him honored for it.
isn't this what we speak for?
people like Billy... Ray...
are you sure you can walk away from them, boss?
if Ray wanted the son to get that medal, he needed a nomination from his commanding officer.
Billy's friend, Skip?
he was at the Army-Navy game that night.
france, Italy, South Pacific.
two brown stars and a purple heart.
you were quite a soldier, Skip.
call me Eugene.
I served in Vietnam my self.
you hurt more than we did. - War is war, all right?
there we were fighiting off vietcong and I'm stuck with a guy that look just like the enemy.
were really odds, right?
a soldier is a soldier.
Manny prove themeselves to be: he died to save another guy in our unit.
a hero.
once we were on patrol we got caught in an ambush.
we got tore up pretty bad.
when the smoke cleared, I saw this Gook running towards me.
I came this close to kill him.
but he was Manny. - Why are you doing me this?
Billy was your bestfriend.
Yes, he was.
a first-rate guy.
so what happened?
when he died you were shipped at the South Pacific.
you saw kamikazes ruin your ships, POW Camps ruin your friends.
I get it Eugene, believe me. - There's nothing to get.
they want you to come back to this world and be the same as when you left.
but you are not.
ray Takahashi appealed to Skip, the boy he knew in California.
but Skip was gone.
fight for your life every day, yeah, you know they're out there.
and those faces... hating you.
faces that look like Billy and like Ray.
that's why they put them in these camps!
they didn't deserve medals, they were the enemy.
go on, catch up with the rest later.
I need to talk to you.
I can't... shipping back out tomorrow.
those medals are for American heroes.
it's what he was, you know it.
Billy sacrificed him self to save others.
so what you people do, isn't it?
kamikazes, suicide mission, - Skip... - Kill yourselves, and take good innocent people with you.
a Jap is a Jap.
what happened to you over there?
why send this letter if he didn't care about us anymore?
read this, read this and tell me it's a lie.
stop!
tell me those boys weren't heroes. - Stop!
and Billy doesn't deserve that medal. - Go home, Jap!
I am home. My boy was more American than you'll ever be.
dear dad, it's the night before we go in the battle, and I can't sleep.
even in my dreams I hear the artillery and I'm so afraid.
when I need to be brave,
I think of you, dad.
and your strenght in the world that's no longer simple.
sometimes I dream I'm home again, drawing pictures of you, mom and little Barbara.
and none of us behind bars, because in my dreams we are free.
I know now that's why I'm here:
it's not about who I'm fighting against but who I'm fighting for:
you dad.
I want your dream's America could be.
should be.
I see all of us in this battle field, white, black, brown, yellow...
and that's the America I know.
maybe one day I'll see you there, dad.
love, your son, Billy.
the followin story is ficeional and does not depict any actual person or event july 20. 1969 moon landing 4-13 is in.
we copy you down, Eagle.
Houston, uh, Tranquility Base here.
the Eagle has landed.
you just missed the moon landing, you little troglodyte.
get out of here, Laura!
don't have a spaz.
I don't care about your stupid toy, Danny boy.
it's not a toy. Get out!
why don't you get out?
you haven't left the house in three days.
mom! Laura's bothering me!
mom sent me.
personally, I could care less if you stay a friendless goober your whole life.
Hello? Earth to Danny...
wow, he's leaving the house! Hold on. Let me get a picture.
detective McAvoy, Lilly Rush.
a retired detective. Just Mack, now.
well, you said you got something for me to look at?
Yeah, couple days ago guy comes into the Fairmount Station.
drops this off. - Some kind of model rocket?
Yeah, he found it up near the bluffs over the Wissahickon.
some, uh, civilian desk jockey processed it and didn't even bother ID'ing the guy who brought it in.
Yeah, civilian humps doing cops' work.
Yeah, take a look here.
the Chestnut Hill Rocket Boys launched this vehicle
july 20, 1969 AD in peace for all mankind." Signed "Danny Finch.
day after we landed on the moon, Danny Finch's body turns up in the Schuylkill.
he was 12 years old.
that was my first year in Homicide.
tough way to start out.
Yeah, tough on the family.
any suspects? - Scumbag Reggie Blunt.
he got popped for a laundry list of murders around the city that year.
and the DA lumped my kid's case in with them.
never got a conviction, but everybody was sure he did it. Except me.
talk to Danny's friends back in the day?
no, he didn't have any.
boy was a loner, you know, science nerd type.
blunt went down for the other murders and brass said there was no more meat on the bones.
he pushed me to move on.
this gives you something to chew on.
Yeah, this rocket was in the park two miles upstream from where the body was found.
I interviewed all the kids in the neighborhood.
I got nothing.
but this makes me think that maybe he did have some friends after all.
these "rocket boys." - I don't know, Mack.
a toy rocket's a tough sell with the bosses.
I've been 39 years turning over in my sleep what could have happened to this kid.
you have any idea what that does to you, Detective?
no one else around here will give me the time of day.
and I hear you take cases nobody else will.
you find this kid's murder, maybe I can get to sleep again.
rocket Boys, huh?
Yeah, you think I'm crazy, huh?
I don't think you're crazy, Mack.
this baby is a freaking marvel. Check it out.
Custom-machined, high-grade chrome nickel washer.
a 12-year-old kid built this?
get it to Evidence, see if they can lift any prints inside the cylinder.
pretty skimpy box on this kid. You sure your boyfriend did all his homework?
blunt gets credit for the murder, suddenly Mack's strong-armed to move on.
blunt gets shanked in Graterford in '78.
he knew anything about it, he took it to his grave.
old Crackpot Mack.
Oh, you knew him, boss?
he was in Homicide when I was still walking a beat in Fishtown.
he's a good cop.
bosses thought he cared a little too much.
autopsy report's got Danny with abrasions on the face and body, a cracked skull, blunt-force trauma.
kid got banged up pretty bad.
Aw, Chestnut Hill Chemistry Award, 1968.
I didn't even know they had chemistry in 6th grade.
Danny's sister Laura is in with Jeffries now.
see if she knows anything about this rocket.
or the Chestnut Hill Rocket Boys.
can I smoke in here?
uh, no.
sorry. I thought police station, you know, maybe.
not unless you're planning on confessing.
I lost my baby brother the day they put a man on the moon.
I still can't look at it without thinking about him.
you two were close?
I was pretty awful to him, actually.
it breaks my heart now.
at that age, you just don't think.
Danny say where he was going that day?
he never told me anything.
he sort of holed up in the science.
skipped a grade when he was eight, ended up in my class. Drove me crazy.
we found this up in the park.
Danny's name on it.
know anything about it?
math, science, chemistry. He was more about equations than this sort of thing.
what about a "Chestnut Hill Rocket Boys" club?
Danny in a club?
no way. But...
the week before he died, I saw him with some boys from the neighborhood.
right...Right here.
all right, perfect.
okay. Perfect.
Neil Armstrong readies the launch vehicle for ignition.
how come you always get to be Neil?
huh, Chuck?
cause I'm the commander.
you can be Buzz Aldrin, the mission specialist.
okay, she's set to fly, Captain.
saved every cherry bomb I could find from 4th of July.
rocket's loaded and ready for liftoff!
loaded and ready. This baby's going to the moon!
I hope you know it's not going to work.
go play with your Bunsen burner, Poindexter. Busy here.
look, you can't just pack it full of explosives.
you have to cut the powder with sulfur, otherwise...
kid, we need your help, we'll ask for it.
got it?
all right, men. Let's light this candle.
let me do it, Chuck.
here we go!
ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four...
told you so.
that stunt caused a lot of trouble.
Chuck's dad about skinned him alive.
remember their names?
just Chuck Pierce, the cute one.
but those three, they were always together, though.
ever see them with your brother again?
Chuck came by the next day.
asked to see Danny.
I remember being disappointed. I thought he was there to see me.
civvie who took in the rocket's a real paperweight.
Oh, let me guess: less than helpful.
like pulling teeth.
I finally got him to rember what time the guy brought it in.
I went back and dug through the catch desk sign-in sheets.
came up with a name: Mike Collins.
great, got to be what, 800 of them in the Philly phone book?
Yeah. Go, Irish.
your boyfriend called again.
Mack asked if we want him in on interviews.
told him,"Thanks. We're good."
you going to share your desk with this guy, Lil?
Aw, he was a good cop.
tough to walk away when you got business to settle.
I'm still sweating cases after I get my gold watch, do me a favor, put me out of my misery.
count on it.
crackpot Mack said Chuck Pierce used to run with some boys: Seth Rundgren and Bobby Kent.
all three of them interviewed in '69.
said they were watching the moon landing together.
doesn't look like Chuck let go of the rocket thing.
naval aviator, applied for NASA in the '90s.
private air captain now.
Lear jets of the rich and famous.
poor man's Neil Armstrong, this guy.
let's see what Neil Armstrong has to say about the Rocket Boys.
Yeah, it was a real shock when Danny turned up dead.
block was never the same again.
Yeah, how so?
predator on the streets.
parents wouldn't let kids play outside after dark anymore.
only now, thinking Danny might have been with friends the night he died.
you friends with Danny back then, Chuck?
friends? Not really.
no, Danny was kind of a...kind of an odd duck.
on the night of the moon landing, did you see him around?
no, I was at home watching it on TV.
pinnacle of human achievement.
you with anyone?
Yeah, I was, I was with, uh, Seth Rundgren and Bobby Kent.
haven't seen those guys in years.
they lived on my block. - The Chestnut Hill Rocket Boys, right?
Yeah, well, rockets were a phase, I mean, probably because of the moon landing and all.
I think we were into sharks the next week.
then, uh, why'd you stop by Danny's the day after you and your posse blew the neighborhood to China trying to launch a rocket?
Ah, well, we wanted to see what he knew.
I mean, a rocket without a brain to guide it is pretty much just a pipe bomb.
he help you out?
Oh, yeah, sure, he'd do anything, anything to be our friend.
we, we were just out to have a good time, but this kid...
this kid was obsessed.
once we're in, we got to move fast.
the foreman, Mr. Wallace, hates kids.
heard he killed a guy on his site once.
they say he buried the body in the yard.
never found it.
we have to make the nozzle out of something that'll hold up to the heat from takeoff, launch the vehicle all the way into the mesosphere.
geek.
you don't shut it, I'm gonna launch you in the mesosphere.
we're supposed to be sneaking in, Nimrods Wallace is going to hear us a mile away.
this is it.
up and over, men.
uh, guys?
I'm really not so great at climbing fences.
Ah, gee, there's a surprise.
there, we need that piece.
the one that's shaped like a cone right on top-- it's perfect.
come here!
Hey, you little bastards!
go, go, go! - Get the hell off this property.
you think you're going to steal from me?
bite it, dirtbag.
you runt.
show your face in here again, you'll see what happens, man.
come on! Come on!
that guy was a damn menace.
everybody knew it, but like I said, that kid Danny-- he was obsessed.
you saying he went back?
he told us that...everything we need to launch a rocket was inside that fence.
when was this?
Oh, I don't know, maybe a week before the moon landing.
Neil ARMSTRONG That's one small step for man, one...
giant leap for mankind.
night, Lil.
you find anything on the rest of Chuck's crew?
well, Seth Rundgren has a colorful history.
a court-ordered lockup '86 to '90.
Schizo-affective disorder.
Bobby Kent's a floor manager at Zane's Sporting Goods in Germantown.
what about this Wallace character?
picked up an assault and battery in '68 for slapping around a junkie trying to steal copper from his site.
put the guy in ICU for three weeks.
you get something off that rocket, Nick?
rocket science, people.
well, the factory that machine-tooled the metal cone Danny used as a nozzle was located right here in Philly.
dwc Custom Manufacturing.
place was knocked down, the summer of '68, and guess who's on the books as site foreman for the demolition company.
meaner than a junkyard dog.
best demo company on the Eastern seaboard.
ain't a building they put up I can't pull down on a dime.
69, though, you were just starting to make a name for yourself.
I paid my dues.
took any job that'd have me. Demo, drywall, construction.
site watchdog.
Yeah, I was the ogre.
somebody had to be. Rob you blind, otherwise.
like that junkie you busted open back in '68.
freak pulled a knife on me.
what am I supposed to do? Bleed on him?
sure, I get it.
sometimes you got to crack a few skulls, get things done.
Yeah, you said it.
what about Danny Finch?
kids tried to sneak on your lot, you make a few threats.
week later, this boy turns up beaten to death.
Danny thought he could outsmart you, sneak back in.
it's not like you didn't warn him.
Yeah, I warned him all right, not that it did any good.
you got to be some kind of special nitwit, right?
it's almost $14.
it's all I got.
W - We just need maybe 200 grams of potassium nitrate.
forget it.
seriously, kid, amscray.
look, I'm sorry we broke in, but my friends
they're counting on me.
I'm like Wernher von Braun to them.
the scientist who created the space program.
without him...
without me that rocket will never fly.
I've been up all night working out the mix, trying to get it right.
if I do, maybe they'll see that I'm...
that you're what?
nothing.
probably hopeless anyway.
the calculations never come out right.
it's going to explode or fly off course.
I'm gonna regret this.
should be about the right mix.
need an emulsifier to bind the powder.
the right nozzle, it should burn clean instead of a...
fast explosion. Know what I mean?
Hey, kid.
Calculations'll only get you so far in life. Right?
at some point, you got to get outside, you got to make it work.
wow, this is perfect.
Yeah, the scrap metal's... - Yeah, I know.
saw the perfect part for the nozzle when we were here before.
well, take what you need, all right?
just don't be bringing your little hood pals back.
Hey, kid.
you blow yourself up, you leave my name the hell out of it.
you dig?
all right, now beat it.
you gave a 12-year-old kid dynamite?
it was a different time.
no lawsuits, no helmets, no safety seats.
we let kids be kids.
So...Danny, he...
managed to launch that rocket, huh?
looks like it.
that's good.
good for him.
detectives Rush, Vera.
need a hand?
no, thanks. - Few questions about Danny Finch.
mind if we come inside, talk about it?
the last time I saw Danny, he wanted us to break into a construction site.
we heard.
we climbed a fence and, and a man came out with a baseball bat and chased us away.
right. What about after that?
the day of the moon landing. You see Danny that day?
please don't touch that.
Whoops.
Seth. The day of the moon landing.
The-There was no moon landing.
come again?
it's the pinnacle of human achievement, and it was a hoax.
th-they shot the whole thing on a, on a soundstage.
who's "they"? - NASA, the CIA, LBJ.
lyndon Johnson faked the moon landing?
I've talked to agents who were there.
they tell me things, th-th-the tr-- the truth about what happened that day.
Danny think the same way?
he said it was the scientists who made it happen.
without them, the Eagle never would have landed.
Seth, the broadcast about the Eagle landing happened the day Danny died.
if he said that, it means you saw him that day.
three of you were with him when he launched the rocket.
the Chestnut Hill Rocket Boys.
I know what you're trying to do.
y - You're trying to get me to say that I, I see Danny.
but he's gone.
I - I know that.
but you still see him sometimes?
they say it's the disease.
it, it, it makes me believe things that aren't true.
who's "they"? - Chuck and Bobby?
Seth, you talk to them lately?
your friends when you were 12.
how many of them do you still talk to?
guy gives new meaning to the word "certifiable."
keep pushing, we'll never get a straight story out of him.
just lock up under pressure.
stick a tail on him, see what he does, where he goes.
believe his rap about not talking to Bobby and Chuck?
not for a second.
I did steal his phone bill off his desk.
lot of calls to one number.
bet it ain't the CIA.
I got a few minutes before I'm back on the floor.
say you're looking for some contact info for Seth Rundgren?
Yeah, know any way we can get a hold of him?
I wish I could help, but...I haven't talked to him in, gosh, ages.
go ahead. Pick it up. We'll wait.
hello.
what up, liar?
got your number off of Seth's phone records.
he's been calling you 20 times a week for the past month.
you sure you haven't talked to him in ages?
you can hang up now, Bobby.
the three of you were with Danny the night he died.
Seth already told us. - Question is: why is he calling you so much?
and why are you both lying about it?
look, Seth has a pretty weird imagination.
one way of putting it.
something go down with Seth and Danny that night?
no.
Oh, come on, Bobby.
unstable guy... - Maybe not even his fault, right?
out in the woods, a dare gone bad.
guess we got to take you downtown, sort this all out.
okay, okay, all right.
it isn't about Seth.
Seth and Chuck are lying to protect me.
this is outstanding.
nice job, Danny.
Yeah.
nice job.
Bobby, why do you say everything Chuck says right after he says it?
I don't.
actually, you kind of do.
shut up, dork. What do you know?
Hey, ease off.
he's the reason we're out here.
ought to be at home watching this on TV.
you kidding?
this is way better. - We're living it, man.
right, Danny?
Yeah, this is the best.
never really been in the woods before.
we're explorers.
conquerors.
I'm Neil Armstrong, commander of the...
what was that?
there's something in the woods.
my half-brother, Malcolm, and his dirtbag buddy, Griff...
they used to beat our ass every chance they got.
you left Danny behind with them?
nothing we could have done... - And when Danny turns up dead?
they killed Danny-- what do you think they would have done to me?
where are your parents in all this?
dad split, and Mowas working all the time.
she left Malcolm in charge of me.
best thing that ever happened was the two of them shipping off to Vietnam the second they turned 18.
Griff died over there.
Malcolm came back even worse.
and where is he now?
up at Graterford, doing ten to 20 for armed robbery.
so, now Brother Bobby's trying to pin a murder on me-- that's swell.
it sounds like you got it coming.
made his life hell.
life is hell.
better he learned that early on.
nice record you got, Malcolm: armed robbery, assault, killing animals.
not a big leap to doing in a kid.
you made your minds up. Pull the trigger already.
says here you got a shot at parole in seven months.
number might come down or go up, depending how interesting you make our time here.
this is a simple question.
see Danny that day or not?
Yeah, we saw him.
kid was about to wet his shorts.
you like that sound, maggot? - Let me go.
should have learned to run faster, professor.
might have lived a little longer.
Hey, what have we got here?
man, that is one big-ass firecracker.
fuse and everything.
what are you gonna do with this, dork?
let's light it under his twerp ass, see how many pieces it makes of him.
leave it alone. It's ours!
leave it alone! Or what, wuss?
light it up, Griff.
broke my nose!
kill him.
what? The rocket's mine, numb-nuts.
wait up.
deviated my septum, little bastard.
you hear that? Still whistles when I breathe.
got your asses kicked by a couple 12-year-olds?
Seth wanted that rocket real bad.
he was crazy enough to take us on for it.
Hey, I was honest with y. That's got to be worth something, right?
right. We'll get back to you, Malcolm.
no, you won't.
I been in here long enough. I ain't stupid, but hey...
uh, took you long enough.
thank you.
never much into housekeeping.
those intervie that you took from the boys in the neighborhood...
still got them?
I got everything.
so, where do you want to start?
Seth Rundgren, Bobby Kent, and Chuck Pierce.
you ever have a case like this?
you know, one that sticks with you, doesn't let you rest?
Yeah, I...I do.
name's Cooper.
and the kicker is he's still out there.
unsolicited advice?
don't let it sit for 30 years.
starts eating away at you. Trust me on that.
their stories are exactly the same, across the board - "pinnacle of human achievement."
still doing it today. Chuck says it.
Seth's got the same lines, word for word.
like The Manchurian Candidate.
Danny gets killed here in the park and dumped in the Wissahickon.
then floats all the way down to the river.
some of the injuries could have come from the beating he took, but the marks on his legs and arms...
maybe postmortem, bumping off the rocks as he drifted?
well, it was a rainy summer.
creek was swollen. Would have only taken a few hours.
now, that spot could be right where our Michael Collins found the rocket.
michael Collins? - The guy who brought in the rocket.
probably a fake name.
michael Collins was the third astronaut on the Apollo 11 mission.
third astronaut?
armstrong and Aldr landed on the moon, put their footsteps down, became heroes, and Michael Collins...
he stayed in orbit around the moon and never landed.
the boys were playing astronauts. If Chuck was Armstrong, and Bobby was Aldrin...
Seth was Michael Collins.
you...you followed me.
you found the rocket here?
no, not, not...not here.
up the path by the ravine.
you ought it in 'cause you wanted us to reopen Danny's case. Why?
I don't want to...to see it anymore.
I...I want it to stop.
what do you want to stop, Seth?
what I remember. It can't be real.
what wasn't real? The moon landing, the launch?
no, our...our launch was...was real.
you chickens through running away?
Oh, you made it back.
you got away.
holy crap. - How did you do it?
Danny punched Malcolm right in the honker.
Nah, it was all Seth.
I'd be dead if he didn't come back.
we're all dead anyways.
Malcolm will never let this go.
forget it.
he can kill us tomorrow.
right now...
we got a rocket to launch.
Yeah.
let's do it.
this is right here. - Yeah Great. This is it.
engraved it, so whoever finds it knows who we are.
the rocket boys
we're now switching to mission control as Neil Armstrong exits the spacecraft.
Hey, guys, listen.
they're walking on the moon.
that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
they did it.
you light it, Seth.
what happened then, after the launch?
what happened out here?
we had to jump.
it was only way to get home before our parents caught us.
Chuck and Bobby told me he...he didn't make it, but I know that's not true.
because I saw him.
I think you're gonna have to come with me.
how long you been at him?
hour or so. Guy's all over the place.
still think he knows who did it?
I don't know.
a whole lot more than just phone calls between these three.
Chuck and Bobby have been paying Seth's way the last 20 years.
a lot of money.
got Chuck's name on receipts for clozapine, Loxitane.
heavy meds.
they're doing everything they can to keep him quiet.
boss!
get the medics!
this is Rush in Homicide.
get a medic unit in here now.
pronounced him at the ER at Roxborough.
guy was a mess. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Yeah, well, nothing you could have done, Nick.
something happened at that creek.
and Seth would rather die than tell us what it is.
your friend's on the slab, Bobby.
Seth? - Killed himself right over the table you're leaning on.
died keeping your secret.
almost like you killed him yourself.
poor guy.
never really had a chance. - Friends like you...
I guess not.
don't seem very surprised, Chuck.
we did everything we could to help him.
why is that?
goodness of your heart?
we were practically brothers, the three of us.
we couldn't let him down.
that's what everybody did his whole life.
you tried to help him. - That's right.
just little things. Making sure he was okay.
little things. Like the 14, 000 bucks for his mental hospital?
ten years' worth of antipsychotic meds?
that wasn't me. - What happened at the creek, Bobby?
Seth said Danny made the jump; Chuck said he didn't.
what's Chuck paying all that money to hide?
all right, so I...I paid a few of Seth's bills.
it's only because he couldn't afford to do it. Bobby, either.
you were keeping him quiet.
no, I was helping him cope.
with your secret. Tearing him up inside for the past 39 years.
the jump, Chuck. Tell us what happened at the jump.
Chuck bent over backwards to help Seth.
that's the kind of guy he is. End of story.
I got nothing else to say.
little memento for you.
sit here with your dead friends and think about w they got that way.
Chuck's not gonna break unless we got him cold.
Bobby's so deep in his thrall, it's like getting him to rat out Jesus.
hero worship.
Chuck's throwing money at the problem, but Bobby's doing all the work.
cause Bobby actually cares.
I got this.
get up.
I gotta cuff you before I take you to your cell.
Wait...what?
Chuck tossed you uererhe bus.
you're locked up for murder.
Chuck wouldn't...
he wouldn't do that. - Well, he did.
and he's gonna get away with it because you're too spineless to do the right thing.
get up.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything!
save it! Bedtime story for your cellmate.
wait, Chuck said I did something?
why would he do that? - I don't get it.
you follow the guy around like a sheep.
I'm not a sheep. - Baaa, baaa, baaa.
that's all I hear when you open your mouth.
guy thinks he's the king of the world, jetting around, and you're stuck here cleaning up the mess.
with Seth? I was glad to do it.
Chuck said we were a team.
he's my best friend.
sit down.
last chance.
or you're gonna spend the rest of your life in a cell half the size of this room.
we tried to get back home after we launched the rocket.
Chuck said he knew the way, but he was wrong.
not this place again.
we've been outere e alnight.
we gotta get home.
too far to jump.
we gotta go around.
that's what you said last time.
how we got lost in the first place.
we're never gonna make it back before our parents wake up.
what about your dad? - I said it's too far.
standing around talking about it is just gonna take longer.
we can do it.
you?
not a chance. Forget it.
we can do anything.
we're the Rocket Boys. - Will you shut up about that?
it's stupid. - It's not stupid.
it's the best thing ever. - You don't get it.
I'm not even supposed to be out here.
my dad finds out, I'm dead, okay?
we go around.
what's this?
let's go.
I'm with Danny.
you'll never make it, Seth.
yeah? Watch me.
he's right.
see you at home, suckers.
almost didn't make it over, fat-ass.
lay an egg, psycho.
I cleared it by a mile.
Yeah.
race you to the bend.
I never saw a kid so proud of himself.
Chuck said he was too weak, he didn't make it.
but he did.
so how'd he end up in the water? - I don't know.
we ran on ahead.
look, Chuck was the leader.
if he said it, it had to be true.
after a while, I started believing it myself.
but Seth never did.
it just chewed him up on the inside.
I've been checking into your family, Chuck.
who knew the Pierces were such an American dynasty?
Yeah, Dad's a war hero.
built a textile company from scratch, turned it into an empire.
you got a point?
it's hard to live up to. Only son.
a lot of pressure on a kid.
I thrived on it.
some people do. - Right.
right,'cause you were following in his footsteps.
and 12 years old or not, you were a leader.
that's why, when Danny fell in the crick, you tried to save him.
he was so out of shape...
he couldn't hold himself above the water.
he must've panicked.
that's what happens, situations like that.
he was going to pull me down with him.
I... I had to save myself.
I... I mean...
so help me, God, I let him drown.
then covered it up.
Papa Pierce found out, worse than being punished, he'd have been disappointed in you.
it was an accident.
and I spent the rest of my life trying to make up for it.
you know, there's just this one little detail that doesn't fit.
Danny didn't drown, Chuck.
there's no water in his lungs.
that's got to be a mistake. - No mistake.
someone cracked him in the skull with a blunt object.
whack.
we didn't just check into your family, Chuck. We checked into you.
being an astronaut - now that would've gotten your old man off your back for once.
no, but NASA rejected you.
three times.
pretty good thing he's not around anymore to see you.
bus driver in the sky for rich people.
now Danny, he was a real leader.
Danny was weak. He was no leader.
buddies thought he was. Launched the rocket, made the leap.
Danny said jump and they jumped.
but you...you were scared.
Papa Pierce finds out about that, might as well not go home at all.
you go to hell, all right? I was no coward.
and Danny's death was no accident. - I want a lawyer.
you're dying to shut us up.
can see it on your face.
know what we did to piss you off - what did Danny do?
Danny shouldn't even have been there.
Danny was no Rocket Boy.
maybe not at the beginning, but he made the jump.
he made it across.
he wasn't the hero. I was.
it's okay, Chuck. You can do it.
you're Neil Armstrong, remember?
just shut up!
I'm not scared, all right?
then jump. Come on. It's no big deal.
help me!
Chuck, I lost my glasses!
I can't see!
help me! - Chuck!
Chuck, help!
Chuck, help me! Chuck!
Hey, what's going on?
I won't tell them you were scared, Chuck. - Hey, where are you guys?
you think I was scared? - What's going on?
???
you get done cleaning up that mess, go tackle the john.
stopped up again.
I look like a janitor, Tommy?
haven't taken my lunch yet.
you're spending too much time on each job, Ed.
you gotta turn around six more cars after you clean the can.
I'd eat first before I walked in there, Ed.
or call FEMA.
Hey, Channel 7, what's she wearing?
welcome to Pennsylvania Power...
wearing out your bank account, buddy.
it's a sucker's dream.
ed... can I talk to you?
Yeah.
um, I just got the estimate on my car.
I can't afford this.
two grand-. ain't that beautiful.
Tommy ought to be ashamed of himself.
Yeah, I just got my tuition bill, but I need my car to get from work to school...
relax. Relax.
most of these repairs you don't even need.
and I got a rebuilt water pump in the back.
I just need it to run.
uh... what can you afford?
um... maybe 400.
400?
okay. I'll fix all the stuff you need to have done and drop it off your place tomorrow.
don't sweat it, Shelly.
Thanks, Ed. - ??
you're the best.
11...
keep cutting folks a break like that, boss'll take it out of your hide, Ed.
Yeah, he can kiss it.
20...
49...
Hey, what's it up to?
huh?
jackpot. What's the latest?
I don't know. 7, 8 mil?
27...
break's over, George.
ed, you just tell that customer we padded her bill?
...and 55.
thanks for playing Pennsylvania Power Lotto today.
benefits to public school...
talking to you, Ed.
you can stick it where the sun don't shine, Tommy, 'cause I quit!
look at this!
how long you playing the lotto, Ed?
well, since my sister Pam was old enough to buy me a ticket.
Hey, Ed!
what are you planning on doing with the 8 million?
what do you think?
I'm gonna spend it!
Oh, yeah.
well, Detective Strickland just caught that double over in Point Breeze.
I'll call you later.
look like you could use a few winks, Walt.
too many open jobs, Lil.
hoping you might be able to take one off my plate.
heard one might be thawing out?
auto mechanic named Ed Dubinski got popped in Fishtown on his way back from the SwiftMart.
way back to where?
working late in the garage.
shooter took his wallet.
robbery gone bad.
what we thought.
thing is, Dubinski wasn't just any grease monkey.
he won eight million in the lottery six months before.
eight million? - Yeah.
I asked the bank to keep Ed's account open in case the doer tried to use the stolen ATM card.
how much was in the account?
seven and change. - Seven mil?
seven dollars and thirty-nine cents.
Dubinski went through it all.
lost eight million dollars?
Yeah.
turns out a lot of these lottery winners get in over their heads.
one third of them go bankrupt in five years.
ed was no different.
something kicked up on the case?
someone used Dubinski's card yesterday at a sandwich shop in Center City.
ATM camera working?
there wasn't one.
doer attempted a withdrawal, checked his bank balance.
means the killer knew his PIN number.
someone who knew him?
or the stickup guy made him give it up.
but why wait two years to hit that account?
unless they think the jackpot's still out there.
moved back to his old Fishtown apartment a few days before his murder.
talk about bottoming out.
the guy burned through eight mil in six months.
wait, how's that even possible?
what was he, smoking it?
jackpot's up to 18 mil this week.
more people in the pool, more tickets we can buy.
I don't know. Seems like a chump's game.
well, this chump's gonna be rich when the money train comes in.
you in the lotto pool, Will?
Nope. It's pointless.
wrong.
point is, dreaming about the things you'd do if you won.
Dubinski went for a pack of smokes at the SwiftMart around midnight.
shot in an empty lot on his way back to the auto repair shop.
slug from a nine recovered from the body.
cashier, Shelly Reid, last to see talking to Rush.
any surviving next of kin?
uh, older sister Pam, owns a hardware store in East Falls with her husband Marty.
took custody of Ed at age 18.
what happened to the parents?
lost mom to a car accident, dad to prison.
what else we got on Ed's finances?
money manager listed here as a Roger Weaver, on the way in.
pin number was 747539.
figure the killer had to know Ed to get that number?
what are the odds of guessing a six-digit PIN?
I'll bet I could guess yours.
shut up.
50 bucks. Give me your ATM card.
tell you right now, it ain't my birthday or my address.
machine eats it, you owe me double.
we'll see.
I work part-time at the Swiftee.
going to night school to become a veterinarian.
tough, though, you know?
you knew Ed from the store, Shelly?
he worked up the street, used to come in for coffee and smokes.
seemed like a nice guy.
you said that he fixed your car?
it was always breaking down.
he knew I was on a tight budget, so he'd cut me a break and then I'd give him free refills.
ed come in to use the ATM a lot?
sometimes. Just coffee that night, though.
he'd just moved back to Fishtown.
he seem okay to you when he left the store?
I think he was a little embarrassed about losing all that money.
can't believe somebody would shoot him.
sweet guy, you know?
I can only offer financial advice, Detective.
most of my clients take it.
Mr. Dubinski was an exception.
an $8 million exception.
5. 2 after taking the lump sum.
3 million after taxes.
another million down on a house with property tax due.
and the rest went to whomever had their hand out first.
how'd you get hooked up with Ed, Mr. Weaver?
well, I get most of my clients through referral, but Mr. Dubinski found me in the Yellow Pages.
you draw up a will for him?
well, I set him up with an attorney to handle it, but he was killed before the scheduled appointment.
so any money would've gone to...?
his sister, now stuck with probate.
but I'd be surprised if there's enough to cover his funeral expenses.
we'll need to take a look at all of his financial records.
look, Detective,
I regret I couldn't help him more than I did.
but a fool and his money are easily parted.
my little brother practically grew up in this store.
always tinkering with something.
Marty taught him how to fix things.
how he got so good with cars.
anyone you know had a problem with Ed?
no. Everybody loved him;
he was like a big kid.
if anything killed Ed, it was that damn lottery.
the lottery killed Ed?
we never had any money when we were growing up.
it was all just too much.
his face gets on TV, and all of a sudden he's surrounded by a bunch of phonies taking advantage of him.
any in particular you remember?
I didn't know any of them.
too many freeloaders to count.
well, hard to believe how fast he burned through all that cash.
I tried to get him to do something constructive with it, but it was like, like the money wasn't real to him.
cleaned out his apartment, there was nothing but bills left.
and this probate thing is still a mess.
I'd like to get copies of Ed's probate papers if that's okay.
however I can help.
is Ed the kind of guy that'd give out his ATM card or PIN number?
maybe. Ed trusted everybody-- generous to a fault.
problem was, he just...couldn't say no.
Hey! - Hey.
Hey, hey, you guys check out the bathrooms?
all-black porcelain and gold fixtures.
plasma TVs in every one. Huh?
Oh, it's, uh, it's really something, Ed.
are those, uh, a pinball machines over there?
Yeah!
I used to get up everyday to fix cars, now I just play pinball all day.
Hey, Pammy, you remember when we were kids when we went to Atlantic City?
and then we just like played all day.
of course I remember, Ed. Yeah.
do you know all these people?
sure, they're all my friends.
just hope you're not spending too much money.
Oh, hey, that reminds me.
I got, I got something special for you guys.
no, open it. Open it.
Oh! The Atlantic City boardwalk.
it's 50, 000! - Wow!
I owe you, Pam.
ed, you know you don't owe me a thing.
Thanks.
you're the best, bud.
Thanks.
if you guys need anything else, you just let me know, okay.
smokey One-Niner, this is Rubber Duck!
your presence is requested outside on the double.
Oh, dude.
sounds like my ride just got here. Hey, come on.
come on!
Hey!
Whoa!
Yeah!
Oh, hello, pretty car.
this is awesome!
how much this car cost, Ed?
who cares? Look at it!
old Georgie wasn't laughing too hard when his buzz wore off.
george Sweeney, from the garage?
Yeah, the two of them were like kids in a candy store.
used to be good friends.
sounds like he handed out a lot of checks.
we didn't need it, but we put it to good use something I wish that Ed would have done.
now, George Sweeney filed a two million-dollar lawsuit against Ed.
hired that ambulance chaser with those late-night TV ads.
the "King of Compensation.
any record of a trial or a settlement?
looks like it was dismissed.
george still works at the auto shop in Fishtown.
near where Ed was killed.
Yeah, maybe old George figured out Ed's PIN number, thought he was still due a nice settlement.
what do you got?
figure out how the code's personal, we figure out how the shooter could have known it.
run Ed's personal info?
Mm-hmm, old phone numbers, addresses, friends' birthdays, social numbers, you name it.
nothing yet.
we get any paperwork from the money manager?
eight million dollars of it.
saw the latest jackpot just went up to $33 million.
Nick sucked you in on that pool?
33 will pay for a lot of old Blue Note vinyl.
how about you, boss?
got a better chance of winning American Idol.
first try, sucker.
knew it had to be either Flyers or boobies.
Hey.
that's gonna leave a mark.
a little jumpy, George, or you just naturally clumsy?
what's this all about, guys?
ed Dubinski-- you took a dive on his property.
ed was my friend.
is that why you sued him?
I had a lot of medical bills.
I just needed Ed's insurance to pay up.
it wasn't personal. - Oh, sure it was.
you go back to rebuild transmissions.
he goes off to spend his millions.
no, I was... I was happy for Ed.
look, I... I was his friend before he won that money, and I was still his friend after he lost it.
how did you know he lost it all, George?
why else would you move back to Fishtown?
you own a gun, George?
no, no, no.
I never asked Ed for a thing, but, I mean, you win a lotto like that, you never know who's gonna come crawling out of the woodwork.
to the good life.
listen, Ed...
I feel real bad about that shark lawyer bugging you.
Yeah, I got to say I was kind of surprised you didn't talk to me first.
I mean, we go way back, right?
I know. I had no idea that he was gonna sue you.
Yeah.
I talked to my, uh, insurance people.
they said that ATV accidents aren't covered under my policy, so...
here.
25 Gs?
that's a lot of money, Ed.
I can't take this.
George, we're like family, man.
I don't want this to come between us.
just... just take it.
Thanks. Tsk.
Thanks.
Oh. I best be going.
some of us got to go back to work.
what, Tommy threatened to fire you?
told me I got to do three clutches tomorrow.
Hey, make sure you resurface the flywheel.
armchair mechanic.
what can I say? I get bored.
all right.
first one with a head shot doesn't have to make a run for beer.
when the real guns came out, you know, I knew that it was time to get back to reality.
the hell was this crazy old codger?
ed said it was his father. - His father?
thought he was long gone.
Yeah, he must have heard about Ed hitting the big money.
came to pick up a payday.
didn't look like he came back to have a catch.
Hey! Jack Dubinski, Philly PD. Open up.
I'm entertaining a friend.
do you mind? - Not at all.
open up, Jack.
come back when you got a warrant.
what did you do that for?
no, you don't.
welcome back to Philly, Jack.
watch the back-- not my back!
that gun's gonna land you back in prison.
how long depends on what you tell us.
what did I do now?
for starters, you're here in the same town your son got capped.
the world's a rough place.
I don't recall your daughter telling us you were at his funeral.
I got no relationship with my daughter.
no, you just came out of your rat hole to shake Ed down.
a month later, your boy's dead.
just 'cause I'm a crappy dad don't mean I'd hurt my own blood.
Ed's old bank card got used a couple days ago.
we turn this place upside down, we gonna find it?
don't know what you're talking about.
why did you go see Ed, Jack?
it wasn't a shakedown.
I just... need a little help, get back on my feet.
some place you got here, Ed.
Thanks.
we like it.
want a drink? We got a bar.
uh, beer is fine.
Hey, can we get two beers, baby?
you remember Nikki?
engaged, huh?
Congratulations.
Thanks.
might want to keep an eye on her.
what do you mean?
one thing I know about...
women who've got one hand on your wallet and one foot out the door.
no risk, no reward, right?
I must have got that from you.
why I kept playing the numbers all these years.
blew through my share of cash, too.
wished I'd put some aside, looked out more for you.
Pam took care of me.
and Marty.
how is your sister?
she'd be surprised to see you.
Yeah. I know I was.
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, kid.
but we have plenty of time to catch up now, don't we?
sure.
Yeah, I'd like that. - All right.
Hey, I got something for you.
it's a... it's a French circus Nikki's been wanting to see.
we're, uh, driving over to Atlantic City tonight.
hoping you could join us.
it sounds like fun.
Yeah, I thought, like, afterwards, we go to the boardwalk, like when Pam and me were kids.
and then we could go play pinball and go over to that museum, you know, the one with the... with the mermaid in it.
Yeah, sure, Ed, listen...
uh, about that thing...
what, Dad?
we talked about it before.
Thanks, son.
don't worry, I-I promise to pay you back.
ed didn't like what I said about his lady, but he sort of knew I was right.
so, where were you the night Ed got shot?
St. Joe's.
the hospital, getting prepped for surgery.
surgery?
fused vertebrae so I can work again.
Ed's money saved my life.
finally able to hold down a job.
another Hallmark moment in the Dubinski clan.
Yeah, we talked about keeping in touch, but it just wasn't gonna happen.
maybe you could call your daughter, see if she'll bail you out.
Upsy daisy.
Riskey," with an E.
Uh-uh. - Why?
guy's a mechanic, not a spelling bee champ.
put it in.
satisfied?
not until I get everybody in the pool.
know what the jackpot's worth?
enough to get me a down payment on a Main Line mansion.
walk-in closet...
full of high-heel shoes.
more tickets we get, the better our chances.
mama could use a new pair of shoes.
Mm-hmm.
going through the probate papers, found this:
a Nikki Dubinski opened a credit card using Ed's name and social.
week before he died.
Ed's fiancee-- they ever married?
well, looks like she was enjoying an extended stay at the Four Seasons when he found out about the card.
froze the account, and she was arrested for credit card fraud.
Nikki von Haven. Quite a sheet.
fraud charges were dropped after Ed's murder.
lucky lady.
know where she is?
faxed her photo to a few of the high-end hotels and just got a call back from the Hardtmore.
the concierge recognized her as one of the ladies on the four-star lounge bar circuit.
Oh... happy hunting for her next millionaire.
macallan 18, neat.
old school Scotch man. I like that.
Nicole Gillette. Pleased to meet you.
John Stillman-- the pleasure is mine.
I'm thinking finance or pharmaceuticals.
close? - Not quite.
try not to make a scene, Nikki.
hate to snatch you up out of here in front of all these nice, rich people.
Ooh. Oh, my.
I see three different names, Nikki.
what's the matter, fellas, slow night in Killadelphia?
ed Dubinski. Your late fianc?
I'm aware.
someone used his ATM card looking for money.
a little pillow talk, figured you knew his PIN.
I don't know anything about that or Ed's murder.
do I look like a killer?
takes all kinds...
even pretty ones.
look, Ed knew the deal.
he enjoyed my company, but we both knew it wasn't built to last.
two guys out front just repoed your little race car, Ed.
Really?
what, you don't care?
you got checks bouncing all over town.
hell, the pool boy even quit.
is that before or after you slept with him?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I know how this works, Nikki.
it's been a good ride, but it's time for me to get off.
no, it's time for you to get off your duff, Ed.
get it together and figure out what you want.
you know what, you're right.
I want you to keep the ring.
so, that's it?
it's time for me to get my house in order.
well, I'd start by paying your property tax bill.
it's three months late.
I don't know which was worse, Nikki...
winning the lotto or meeting you.
that was the beginning of the end for Ed.
went into a tailspin when he couldn't buy his daddy's love.
evidently yours, neither.
what happened to the rest of Ed's money?
he was all but broke by the time he moved back to Fishtown with his tail between his legs.
where were you the night Ed was shot?
with a lawyer from Chestnut Hill.
I'd call him at work.
his wife's a real bitch on wheels.
found some big gaps in Weaver's paperwork.
yeah? How so?
for one thing, he charged him 20% off the top.
20%?! He should have just hit the guy over the head.
hmm. And Weaver only put the minimum down on all of Ed's hard assets.
his house, his car.
to put the cash into bonds?
or so he said, but it looks like he was moving money in and out of his accounts.
using Ed's money as a float.
hmm. Maybe to shore up other clients' accounts?
robbing Peter to pay Paul.
I checked with the Board of Standards for certified financial planners.
ed filed a formal grievance against Weaver just before his murder.
could have taken away Weaver's license.
A/V unit found something else.
check it out.
also found him with three other Powerball winners around the state.
lottery millionaires were his racket.
Johnny on the spot.
makes you wonder how he keeps getting there first.
you know what I'd get?
a new Bugatti.
it's mad torque, over 600 ponies.
only built 300 of them.
well, you ain't getting boo-gatti 'cause you didn't pony up for the pool.
what? What? It's not too late, is it?
sorry, pal. Next time.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey, here, come on.
nice. - Whoa.
what the hell?
look at this.
are you serious?
punkass bitch!
punkass bitch?
you do this to my car, pal?
huh? You the guy that been calling me?
Oh, man, you guys are cops?
Yeah, you got two seconds before you catch the beating of your life, moron.
what is your problem, man?
my problem? He slept with my wife.
what?
who's your wife? - Frankie.
she's my wife.
??? going, Roger.
we found the lottery official who had been feeding you names and addresses of the latest winners.
just lost his job.
but he is willing to testify that you paid him for the referrals.
I don't believe this.
working stiff like Ed never had a chance with your paws on his money.
I have been a certified financial planner for over 15 years.
certified scam artist.
securing bad loans, making a mess of his money.
but no bailout for Ed.
he had to file a grievance with the board.
you would have lost your license.
he was gonna have you prosecuted.
but a guy like you would never let that happen.
what's, what's going on?
you think that I had something to do with Ed's murder?
I'm sure the DA would find your attempt to cover up fraud and larceny pretty compelling motive, Roger.
this is ridiculous. I didn't kill Ed.
he almost killed me.
you got to take the long view, Ed.
now, the market-- it took an unexpected turn.
your investments are down for the moment.
they're gonna rebound at some juncture.
how long? - Hard to say.
five, maybe ten years.
but-but I... I still got some money, right?
well, cash flow's a little light right now.
no more toys for a while.
uh, my house, my-my car-- is that some...
well, the good news is that we can use the equity left in your house to pay off the rest of your debts.
and, uh, thanks to me, you still have your old apartment.
thanks to you?
Yeah. I held the lease termination, just in case you needed someplace to go back to.
now, most people aren't as lucky.
lucky? You call this lucky?
back to square one is what it's looking like.
Ah, come on, Ed.
that's a cynical way of looking at it... - Shut up!
I just, uh... I want to know...
I want to know how much money I have in the bank right now, - this very second. - Around $100, 000, but I wouldn't recommend touching that money right now, Ed.
I'm gonna fix this. Come on, let's go. Now.
what? Where?
you're going downstairs with me to the bank so I can get my money.
100 grand in cash?
he put it in the briefcase.
just walked right out of the bank.
couple days later, I heard he was shot.
where were you that night?
I had to meet a new client, Suzanne McGee.
hmm. - Lottery winner from Allentown.
curious.
you even feel anything after hosing a guy like that?
let's be honest, Detective.
wasn't like he earned it.
called the IRS and the SEC.
they'd like to have a little talk with you about all the money you earned, Roger.
met a guy last night, says he knows you.
hmm. Guy who knows me?
Yeah. Your husband, Billy.
you're kidding me.
wish I was.
we're separated.
we have been for a while.
does he know that?
what happened?
he jumped me outside of Jones, Frankie.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
but you're okay? Did you hurt him?
when were you planning on telling me about this?
I mean, that's why you're staying at the hotel, ain't it?
look, it's over.
we're just working some stuff out.
Oh, this isn't gonna be a problem, is it?
I'm thinking, yeah.
so... So, we're off for tonight?
no, Detective Jeffries is not here.
what time's the kid getting arraigned?
Valentine?
got it. I'll make sure he gets it.
money goes to the schools, right?
sure, boss.
could also buy a hell of a boat.
Aloha.
where are we on Ed's missing cash?
well, checked all bank accounts, safety deposit boxes.
even Ed's old locker at the auto garage.
no briefcase, no money.
just got off the phone with his landlord.
said a woman was rooting around Ed's storage unit in the parking garage the day of the shooting.
get a description?
medium height, brown hair, mid-twenties.
wearing a SwiftMart uniform.
thought you just knew Ed from the store, Shelly.
uh, well, yeah.
I mean, he used to come in there all the time.
so what were you doing at his place, rummaging around his storage unit?
what?
I wasn't rummaging.
what were you looking for?
I was just... Nothing.
I was returning his bike.
he let me borrow it.
his bike? - Yeah.
he lent it to me 'cause my car broke down.
he gave me the key to his storage unit.
when was this? The day before.
I had no way to get to class after work.
Really?
he lend you his bank card, too?
what? No.
I dropped my car off at the shop, and George told me that Ed had just moved back.
I heard what happened to him, so I stopped by to cheer him up.
can I come in?
Oh, yeah. Uh, come on in. Sorry.
heard you were back.
just wanted to stop by and say hello.
brought you some cupcakes.
Wow. Cupcakes.
Thanks. Hey, um, do you want a beer?
sure.
figured you could use some cheering up.
first, thought maybe I'd bring you a dog from the animal shelter.
Yeah. I'll stick with the cupcakes.
Oh, you don't like animals?
no, I... I, uh... I do.
I had a dog when I was a kid.
Oh, yeah? What kind?
just a mutt.
um, we named him after that weird museum on, uh, the Boardwalk in Atlantic City.
Ripley? - Yeah.
Yeah, he was always happy to see you.
Oh, yeah, mutts are the best.
never let you down, less disease.
but when he did get sick, you know, we just...
we just didn't have the money to take him to a vet.
that's what you want to do, right, be a vet?
trying. It's hard.
you know, going to school and holding down a job.
Yeah.
how's your... How's your car?
Ugh! Worse.
it's making this horrible noise.
hmm. Right when you turn it on?
Yeah, it's like it's screaming in pain.
Yeah. Probably just a belt.
drop it off at the shop?
Oh, I did, but they said they don't know what was wrong with it.
it's just dying, but I can't afford a new one.
I can fix it.
Oh, I thought you were done with that place.
I'll just call Tommy.
I mean, he's always looking for a good mechanic.
Yeah, me, too.
I mean, um...
if that's what you want to do.
Yeah.
it sure is.
Thanks, Shelly.
Why're you thanking me?
ed left me a message to pick up my car.
the garage said I owed them two grand for the work.
told them, no thanks.
I'll take the bus.
ed happen to mention if he had any money left?
no, and I didn't ask him.
honestly...
I think he was glad to be rid of it.
you see what I see?
man's best friend.
Ed's childhood dog.
dear old sis figured out his PIN number?
that, or she knew it all along.
?? how Ed's probate works, Pam.
wish I could. It's been such a headache.
been almost two years since Ed died, and it still isn't closed?
it's so frustrating, but first, they have to close out all his accounts.
so it's possible that there's an active account still out there in Ed's name with money in it?
I don't think so. I don't know.
you're not even curious?
I mean, you've waited so long.
what are you talking about?
you remember the name of the dog you and Ed had as kids?
our dog? You mean Ripley?
Ripley. That's it.
Yeah. Great name. - Of course.
I brought him home for Ed after our dad took off.
ed loved that dog.
even used his name for a PIN number.
but you already knew that.
what? Wait a minute. I- I don't...
looked into your hardware store.
the bank's got a lien on it.
Marty and I have had some debt issues.
say, your real estate venture. loft conversions, wasn't it?
Yeah, that market went south after Ed died.
you slog through two long years waiting for Ed's probate to close.
his debts get paid off, and you're still left with nothing.
how's that happen?
eight million to zero in six months.
what is this?
I mean, I'd be dying to check the balance of that last outstanding account, too.
especially if I had Ed's bank card.
no.
I loved my brother.
we... argued over money, but we were still family.
we're converting each floor into a loft space.
the kitchen will go here.
and the living room will go here.
it looks really, really good, Pam.
Yeah.
well, careful.
good luck.
ran into a little bad luck, Ed.
that's why I asked you here.
Marty miscalculated a couple things in the budget.
but with your help, we can still get these lofts completed on schedule.
what happened to the check I gave Marty three weeks ago?
the other 50, 000?
I didn't know about that.
I'm sorry, Pam.
I just can't invest any more money in this.
you spent $150, 000 on a race car, and you won't help us out with a real investment?
the car was stupid.
blowing all that cash, but so is trying to solve everybody else's problems.
everyone else?
it just complicates things, Pam.
in a bad way.
you're right. I'm sorry.
don't worry about us. - Yeah?
you guys are going to be all right?
Yeah. Of course.
okay. - We have other options.
business line of credit, home equity line, yeah.
we'll be fine.
question is, are you going to be okay?
Yeah.
I'm just trying to get back to where I started.
are you completely broke, Ed?
Hey, I got my old job back.
I think everything's going to work out all right.
I was so embarrassed.
it's hard enough to ask someone for money.
it must've been even harder for Ed to turn us down.
so your husband never told you he had already hit Ed up for $50, 000?
Marty got in over his head.
he'd shut down whenever I brought up money.
this is a consent form.
it allows us to search your store.
the store? I don't understand.
well, it would just help us to clear both you and your husband.
Marty? But that's ridiculous.
you don't think for a minute that Marty...
do I need a lawyer?
only if you have something to hide.
that's a filthy habit, Marty.
I had a girlfriend, chewed her nails.
it drove me crazy.
Yeah, I guess, you take it all on yourself, huh?
running a business, paying the bills...
why am I here, Detective? - I'm just saying, if I got myself into money trouble,
I'd have a chat with the little lady.
you know, not be a coward about it, that's all.
I know how to handle my own business, thank you.
is that why your wife had to go beg her brother for more money?
after you? - Pam told you that.
also said you screwed up big time on that loft project.
no, we just need enough to get started with the construction, - that's it. - He already gave you a hundred-K.
hell, I'd have turned you down, too.
a hundred thousand was nothing!
he had eight million.
did you even like your brother-in-law, Marty?
Yeah, I did.
I loved Ed.
I treated him like he was my own.
and he repaid you by saying "no
when you needed him most. - Are we finished here?
sit down!
where were you night Ed got shot?
where I am every night.
home with Pam. Ask her.
he was with me, watching TV.
thank you. - Watching what?
I don't know, um...
uh... uh, Wheel of Fortune.
the rest of the night?
and Marty never went out?
I mean, um...
sometimes he went back to the store to close...
to clean up; you know, to make sure it was locked up.
Oh, so he left to go back to the store that night?
I don't know.
I don't know. I can't remember.
you remember what you were watching, but you don't remember if he went out?
Where's, where is Marty?
I need to talk to him.
how did he react when you told him that Ed wasn't going to give you the money?
he must've been angry, wasn't he?
what? No.
no, it wasn't like that.
Oh, everything you did for him, raised him when your father couldn't be bothered.
we did what was right.
what we had to do. - But Ed didn't. Did he?
the fact that you had to, you know, even ask for money?
Marty had a right to be upset.
no. No, Marty loved Ed.
he was my brother.
got it.
$8 million.
Oh, jeez.
Marty, you scared me.
wait, wait-- what are you doing here?
did you really tell Pam you won't help us out, Ed?
come on, Marty, I'm done talking about money.
do you know how hard it was to ask you for that?
Marty, I'm sorry. I can't pay for your business mistakes.
my mistakes?
we had to delay construction, because your sister didn't get the permits.
I don't know what to tell you.
we might lose the store.
what? - The store, Ed!
where you grew up!
does that mean anything to you?
Pam didn't say anything about that.
I just... I don't get it, man.
I mean, after all we did for you.
all the sacrifices we made for you.
look, I'm sorry, Marty.
I can't give you the money. I don't have it.
I don't believe you.
what are you doing?
I'm sorry, Eddie.
the money's coming to us whether you're dead or alive.
no, it's not, 'cause it's all gone.
that's not true!
I gave to someone who deserved it.
the only person who didn't ask me for it...
well, it turns out, there was more money out there, Pam.
shame you'll never see it.
where did you get this?
your dresser drawer.
the search consent you signed was also for your home.
no. Not Marty.
you.
you knew the PIN number.
the card's going to have your prints all over it.
you waited so long, you finally just had to check that account, didn't you?
I didn't shoot my brother.
no, you sent your husband to do the dirty work, then you tried to throw him under the bus.
how dare you...
all you did for Ed, all those years.
how could he just blow it all?
even gave some to your father.
no, he didn't. - Oh, yes he did, Pam.
somehow he cared more about Jack than you.
my father was a bum.
without me, they would've put Ed into the system.
he was eight years old.
and the one time you came to him, he turned you down.
I was his sister. And he owed me!
...to someone who deserved it.
the only person who didn't ask me for it...
it's over.
so young and so hungry, so unqualified
don't want the jobs anyways, no settled life
to get out of here, two options, one chance
you joined the army and I started a band
we'll meet at the bar, we'll buy us a round
we'll toast that we're back home
we'll toast this damn town
Annie's still working behind the bar
you can buy her a drink, I'll sleep in the car
well, let's go
it's on the way back home
it's on the way back home
it's on the way back home
we'll be there soon
we'll be there soon
one of two choices
I guess I've made mine
I drink in a different town nearly every night
and now you don't drink for months at a time
I owe you a couple rounds, we're back home tonight
we'll meet at the bar, we'll drink to old times
we'll toast that we're back home and those left behind
Annie's still working behind the bar

it's on the way back home
we'll be there soon
come on, Mom.
providence, Rhode island February 2008
a lot can change in a year, Jeff.
people lose perspective.
lose perspective?
you're talking to the class president, captain of the track team, 400-meter dash state record holder.
save it, Carl Lewis.
so what do you plan to do during this so-called self-enlightening sabbatical?
travel. I'm going to backpack around and get jobs when I run out of money.
what kind of jobs? A clue for the less enlightened.
uh, teaching English in Beijing...
picking artichokes in Spain...
that sounds very romantic. But what's wrong with a semester abroad once you're at Cornell?
well, you don't go abroad until you're a junior. That's four years away.
and I'm burnt out now.
you don't want me turning into some mental case, do you, Mom?
you care to weigh in here, Ben?
are you even listening?
Yeah.
artichokes.
the first time you're home for dinner, you're not really home.
he's 17. He doesn't have to figure out his future before dessert.
we got to go.
honey?
this is Tom Parker. He's, uh...
he's a US Marshal.
a US Marshal?
what's going on? - Dad?
you can use these to pack.
pack what?
whatever you want to take with you.
where are we going? I don't understand. What's going on, Mom?
Ben, talk to me. - Tom's gonna help us.
everything's going to be fine.
but we need to go.
now.
it's a specialized system.
not some push-and-play you get at the mall.
you're not going to let this go, are you?
Lil, explain to Nick when you're a guest in someone's home, you treat it like a castle.
trouble in paradise?
I accidentally put a beer down on one of King Arthur's speakers here, for which I've apologized.
multiple times.
first of all, it's a tube amp, not a speaker.
and you not only used it as a coaster, you moved it.
maybe two inches.
Yeah, sent the acoustics straight to hell and warped my Benny Carter vinyl.
two words for you guys: couples counseling.
I'm Detective Rush. Can I help you?
my son Jeff--I don't know where he is.
he left for school yesterday. He never came back.
he's not answering his cell phone.
I'm sorry, ma'am. This is Homicide.
I brought his computer 'cause... - We're not Missing Persons.
I can walk you over there if you'd like.
they told me downstairs that you deal with old murders, and, um...
I found this in my son's room.
and I don't know how long he's had it.
body of six-foot Caucasian male, brown hair,"believed to be in his early 40s, "found in the Schuylkill September 24, 2008.
victim wearing jeans and a gray T-shirt...
it was an R. E.M. concert T-shirt. This is... this has to be Ben.
this is about my husband, Ben Feldman.
you're saying your son's missing and your husband was murdered?
I sound like a lunatic. I'm not.
where did you think your husband was all this time?
we didn't know. We just... we just kept hoping that he would come walking through the door.
who would've wanted to kill him?
my husband was an accountant.
he was about to testify against someone in organized crime.
organized crime? Someone in Philly?
no, Providence. Freddy Ghiacconi.
you saying you're in WITSEC? Witness Protection?
that's why we moved to Philly.
you contact WITSEC when your husband went missing?
no, I don't trust them anymore.
please...
detective, I already lost my husband. I don't want to lose my son, too.
the body was found in the Schuylkill on September 24, 2008.
MES estimate it'd been in the water two to three days.
tracks with what Leigh said. Ben disappeared September 21.
concert T-shirt.
automatic for the People.
vintage R. E.M.
it was a. 380 to the back of the head.
ain't how you expect an accountant to go down.
well, Ben took on a client who ended up being connected.
next thing you know, he's doing the books for Freddy "The Ice Man" Ghiacconi.
once you're in...
there's only one way out. Gotta talk to this Ghiacconi.
know where to find him. His trial's been going on for the last four months up in Providence.
probably got an army of lawyers.
Hey, what'd Leigh tell you about Ben's last moves?
well, they were in Cape May on the 21st.
Ben went to Philly that night to get money out of a locker at 30th Street Station.
guy afraid of banks?
gonna want to check security tapes.
well, he would've had to drive.
probably take the Garden State to the Ben Franklin or Walt Whitman.
those cameras at the bridges should be able to get a timed photo of Ben coming through.
Yeah. Wanna check impounds, see if his car turned up?
just got back from the morgue.
keep John Does on ice for a year, and get this: Ben's body was ID'd yesterday.
by who? - His son, Jeff.
he's in Philly.
and he's alive.
least he was at 4: 00 yesterday.
morgue attendant said the first thing he asked about a body found in the river was what kind of gun was used.
already knew it was a gunshot wound.
we got to find that kid, see what else he knows.
Hey, you Curtis Bell?
Yup. Who are you?
I'm Detective Rush. You've been ducking me.
he look church-ready to you?
squeaky clean.
shot his grandma for her Social Security check last year.
now he's my eyewitness in a drive-by.
so, uh, what'd you call about?
second or third time?
Yeah, I don't really do voice mail.
I need your approval for a warrant for a missing kid's cell phone-- GPS or any data.
GPS-- they have that kind of thing on cell phones now?
Yeah, they do.
Scotty, Agent Tom Parker.
have a seat.
so what's this about?
a witness of yours, Ben Feldman.
accountant who was supposed to testify against Freddy Ghiacconi.
Yeah, washed up in the Schuylkill in September-- gunshot.
guy goes missing-- you bother to investigate?
well, the trail went cold.
I have more witnesses than I can handle.
and then we'd already videotaped his testimony.
you think Ghiacconi had him killed?
well, it'd certainly lighten his load.
Ghiacconi's been in the ACI since June. Trial started November 1, and it's still going on.
Ben was your witness, and killed on your watch. How's that happen?
witnesses are unpredictable.
you should know that.
don't always play by the rules.
something going on with the family?
the usual chaos. People enter WITSEC, they have to leave old friends, old lives behind forever.
Listen...I can only set people up,
I can't make them stay...
where were you born, Jeff?
Ames, Iowa.
what brought you to Philadelphia, Leigh?
philadelphia，pennsylvania march 6，2008
my husband had an opportunity in online accounting. Can I at least call my mother?
do you know what she must be going through? We disappeared into thin air.
it's safer for her, for all of us, if no one knows where we are, Leigh.
you'll do anything to avoid my mother, won't you? And what about Jeff's education?
how is he going to get into Cornell with two last names? Two transcripts?
starting tomorrow, he'll be attending St. Xavier High School.
um... we're Jewish.
not in Philadelphia you're not.
you're not a sprinter anymore, either.
you're too fast, it'll raise questions. - What?
dad!
is that really necessary? Jeff's not the witness. I am.
the whole family's vulnerable.
I'm trying to keep you alive here.
right.
cross-country ain't so bad. The great outdoors, right?
and now that we're Catholic, I can have that Christmas tree I always wanted.
don't worry, Leigh.
Jeff will get used to it.
what if he doesn't?
they were good people.
they're different from the criminals I usually protect.
sounds like you got close to them.
you said the "whole family's vulnerable."Jeff got something on Ghiacconi?
Leigh said Jeff used to help his father in the office on weekends-- might have seen something.
what does Jeff have to do with this?
he went missing yesterday.
Where's Leigh?
I'm sorry about Ben.
Yeah.
they told me Jeff's missing. You know, you could've called.
it's not your fault.
if there's anything I can do, you know how to reach me.
did you hear anything about Jeff yet?
a technician's looking at his computer.
we're tracking the GPS on his cell phone.
still nothing.
he stay in touch with any of his old friends?
anyone you can think of he might have gone to see?
I've been wracking my brain. There's no one for him to go to.
no family, friends?
after we joined WITSEC, we cut off everyone we'd ever known.
Jeff never got close to anyone after that.
it was just the two of us.
What'd he think when Ben disappeared?
we both knew Ghiacconi got to him.
neither of us wanted to say it out loud, afraid it'd make it true, so...
he mentioned Jeff might have met Ghiacconi at Ben's office, the weekends he was there.
any other interactions between them you know about?
he ever come over to the house, socialize with the family?
no. No.
I made Ben keep business separate. He spent so much time at the office as it was.
relocation must have been hard on Jeff.
sounds crazy, but...
going into WITSEC actually brought us closer.
hadn't felt like a family in so long.
go, Jeff! Jeff!
philadelphia，pennsylvania September 21，2008，9：06 am
so much for not attracting attention.
Carl Lewis. Can't remember the last time I saw him run.
wonder who he's trying to impress.
now I get it. The reason he spent an hour this morning primping for an 8K through the woods.
hmm. Know your son better than you think.
he looks like himself again.
Tom says kids bounce back faster.
Yeah, yeah. Shorter memories.
am I crazy, or do you maybe hate me a little less?
you have your moments.
but don't push it, Foster.
everything I put our family through...
if ever there were a reason for you to walk away...
...it means the world to me that you didn't.
let's go congratulate Jeff.
go find Jeff.
we need to go now.
um... just when we had a chance to be a family again, we were back on the run.
who was the guy?
Ghiacconi's driver. He took Ghiacconi to all his meetings at Ben's office.
any idea how he found you? - No.
as soon as Ben saw him, we drove to Cape May.
why Cape May? - Place where we had our honeymoon.
Ben loved the Jersey Shore.
we'd walk for hours on the beach.
that the same night Ben came back to Philly for the money?
I figured if he went late at night, he'd be safe.
that was the last time I saw him.
Oh, detectives.
us Attorney in Rhode Island got me up to speed on Vinnie Brown.
you mean Buonaforte.
this says Brown.
Oh, oh. Sorry, I must have grabbed the wrong file.
address matches and so do the fingerprints.
uh, Vinnie Brown. Arrested for burglary in Camden a month ago.
jacked a bunch of flat screens.
do any time?
charges were dropped at the insistence of the US Attorney.
that normal-- US Attorney getting involved in a small-time burglary?
happens every... uh, never.
Oh, federal interference, a name change.
sounds like Ben wasn't the only one in Witness Protection.
bingo. But here's the ass-kicker.
feds snapped this guy's picture in Providence,
august '08.
that's five months after he was relocated to Philly.
check it out. We had the Ice Man.
now we got the Dice Man.
so this Vinnie Buonaforte's in WITSEC with the feds, but working for Ghiacconi in Providence?
playing both sides. Maybe he tries to earn a few stripes with Ghiacconi.
Ah, takes out the feds' star witness against him.
got a cupboardfull of the stuff.
my daughter's trying to knock my cholesterol down.
when are you scheduled to testify against Freddy Ghiacconi, Vinnie?
just waiting for the call.
thought you two were here to prep me.
still keep ties with your old pals in Providence?
you kidding?
they want my head on their living room wall.
so how'd the feds get this pretty picture of your mug in August?
missed my old bakery.
people down here, they don't know a cannoli from a cruller.
we're supposed to believe you'd risk your life for a pastry?
it's true.
WITSEC gave me a second chance. I took it.
I'm a suburban dad now.
I - I punch a clock at a paper company.
I - I play video games with my daughter.
I drive a friggin' minivan.
tell us about the last time you saw Ben Feldman, the Ice Man's accountant.
this is about that?
answer the question, Mr. Cannoli.
I saw Ben...
had to be... over a year ago, back when I was driving Freddy.
Ben was good people. He always offered me coffee every time I brought Freddy by.
uh, and in a mug, too.
wasn't some Styrofoam situation.
we know you tracked Ben down at a cross-country meet in September.
why you lying to us, Vinnie?
right, right. I - I forgot about that.
selective memory will get you hauled downtown.
I was there watching my daughter run.
her school was racing against Ben's kid's.
Ah, that's some coincidence.
right, right.
I admit, uh, it threw me when I ran into him.
been forever since I seen a familiar face.
Hey, Ben, nice to see you again.
Philadelphia，Pennsylvania September 21，2008，9：38 am
you run 'cause of little old me?
if you could see the look on your face.
when I saw you at the race,
I thought,"Crap, he's gonna call Freddy, tell him where I am.
then I realized, you're his friggin' accountant.
probably in WITSEC, too.
since February.
march for me. I'm Vinnie Brown now.
Mynonnamust be rolling in her grave.
what's this? - Zeppole from Scialo's.
I sneak back every few weeks, get a fix.
you live in Philly?
wife hit the bricks when I flipped.
it's just me and my daughter Tammy.
she was racing this morning.
that's why you were at the meet? You scared the hell out of me.
what, you follow us home?
eh, figured you wouldn't notice me in my beautiful minivan.
Where's the wife and kid?
waiting in the car.
six months ago, I'm a bigspacone.
Freddy and I had box seats to all the games, ate at Capreech's every night. Now I'm waiting in line at Costco.
it's weird, huh?
pretending your whole life don't exist before a year ago.
it isn't all bad. I see my family more.
Yeah, yeah.
I could never have got through this without my daughter Tammy.
she's a hell of a kid.
makes a chicken piccata to die for.
biggest gripe's with my marshal; guy practically babysits us.
yeah? I never see my guy.
he even built shelves for my wife's cookbooks.
that ain't right.
there's only room for one set of power tools in the house.
I'm just saying I wouldn't want some other guy in my wife's kitchen.
where were you that night?
had to be home, watching High School Musical with Tammy.
did after every race. A ritual type thing.
there she is.
Hi, Daddy.
my daughter Tammy.
straight A's at Villanova.
talk about the apple falling far from the tree.
cool it on the zeppole runs, Vinnie.
bad for your health.
how about the school? you got the dead back? - got a name
found articles on the Ghiacconi trial on Jeff Foster's computer.
kid was checking every day for updates.
Oh, anything on his e-mail accounts?
uh, just got around his password a few minutes ago.
any luck with the GPS?
Nah, nothing yet.
looking for the only teenager in America not addicted to his cell phone.
Hey, uh, I got tickets to the Sixers game tonight.
uh, I-I can't. Sorry.
hot date or...?
look, Scotty, - Billy and I... - Yeah?
we're gonna give it another shot.
another shot.
just like that? - Family's been all over us.
they even brought in the priests.
I been married six years.
I never put in any effort, you know?
walk away now, you never know what could've been.
Yeah, no. Hey...
do what you got to do. Right?
so we're cool?
Yeah. We're cool.
feds make a habit of putting witnesses who know each other in the same place, Tom?
Vinnie was in Camden. Ben was in Philly.
we needed them close for the trial.
huh. Close enough where their kids run in the same cross-country league?
do witnesses sometimes run into each other? Sure.
it's happened before. It'll happen again.
I noticed Leigh called you that.
all of your witnesses call you by your first name?
some. - Much of a handyman, Tom?
uh, no, not really.
heard you build a mean cookbook shelf.
kept an eye on Ben's family, always checking in, uh...
they were good people, right?
that's what I said.
you and Leigh close?
she was having a hard time adjusting.
I was a shoulder to cry on.
give her more than your shoulder?
I'm not going to answer that.
not very good at your job, are you, Tom?
some issues with boundaries?
where were you the night Ben disappeared, Tom?
I was on a plane transporting a witness to Ohio.
what I don't understand...
if Ben was a key witness in Ghiacconi's trial, why did you let him leave WITSEC?
I didn't have much choice.
philadelphia，pennsylvania September 21，2008，10: 28 am - Got here as fast as I could. - What's going on?
I just saw Vinnie Buonaforte at Jeff's cross-country meet.
I practically had a heart attack.
Vinnie's a witness, too. - You said you would protect my family.
and I will. - Who are we going to run into next? Huh?
Ghiacconi's internist? His tailor?
I am done. I'm out.
I'm going to take care of my family myself.
Ben, come on. You're in no position to go out on your own.
you need me to sign some paperwork, I'll do it. But then I'm gone.
walk away and we'll prosecute.
try to stop me and I'll tell your bosses you slept with my wife.
Yeah, I thought you'd say that.
you stay the hell away from my family.
that was the worst mistake of my life.
bosses ever find out about you and Leigh? - Uh, no.
I'd like to keep it that way.
then you better start playing ball.
what else haven't you told us?
before they left WITSEC,
Leigh asked me how to go about buying a gun.
Where'd you send her?
I sent her to a gun shop in Quakertown.
she and Jeff fell off the grid after Ben disappeared.
and after I found out that she opened a bank account in Maryland,
I stopped looking.
you think she might have killed Ben? - I don't know.
but he took her life away from her once.
she wasn't gonna let him take it again.
crank call?
I'm trying to schedule a sitdown with Freddy Ghiacconi, and his lawyers keep passing me around like a hot potato.
what is it with you people?
well, law school teaches you three things:
delay, deflect, derail and deny.
that's four.
your boy Jeff sent a text at 11: 00 this morning from Philly.
on my way," it said.
who'd it go to?
recipient's got a different carrier.
waiting to hear back.
that's good info. Where did you get it?
I know a guy knows a guy.
tech's gonna call you personally the minute that cell goes live.
uh... help yourself.
got a thing for the Ultra Fine Flairs.
talked to the gun registry.
Leigh bought a. 380 a month before Ben disappeared.
same caliber that killed him.
feds didn't make Ben pay for leaving WITSEC...
Yeah. Maybe Leigh did.
own a gun, Leigh?
what would I need a gun for?
we're wondering the same thing.
no.
receipt from Yankee Arms in Quakertown, dated August 20, 2008.
want to read the signature for me?
I was scared. We needed protection.
you came to us for help, Leigh.
we're trying to find your son. Don't need you holding back.
Jeff ran away. That 'cause of you? - Of course not.
maybe he found out about you and Parker?
or should I call him Tom?
that was a mistake.
Ben and I were gonna put that behind us, try again.
you lied about the gun and forgot to tell us about Parker.
what other surprises you got for us, Leigh?
I know it looks bad, but after all we'd been through...
I still loved my husband.
I found this in your bag.
did Parker give this to you?
no. I bought it myself.
without telling me? - I panicked, thought we might need it.
I'm going to take care of our family, Leigh.
not with guns.
and after today, I believe you.
I know about you and Tom.
is it over? - Yes.
we can get through this.
clean slate.
if you still want to.
I'm sorry.
me, too.
I'm going to go to Philly tonight and get the money.
if you don't hear from me by tomorrow night, you and Jeff go to Snow Hill, Maryland for six months, then...
come on, Leigh. Then what?
then Durham, North Carolina. Stay there five months.
then Austin, Texas.
the accounts are all set up. You'll have everything you need.
I didn't hear from him, so I followed the plan.
Where's the gun now?
in our apartment in Snow Hill.
it's been there... five months.
when's the last time you saw it?
it's locked up. Why?
Jeff ID'd Ben's body, Leigh.
he's been tracking Ghiacconi's trial.
Oh, no.
no, that's not possible. Jeff's...He's not a violent kid.
he ever mention going to Providence?
snow Hill PD searched Leigh's apartment.
couldn't find the gun.
you think Jeff might be taking it to Providence?
I put out a broadcast to all the departments between here and Rhode Island.
well, call Providence PD. Tell them they're gonna need extra uniforms at the courthouse.
all right.
I hit a dead end on the photos of the bridges, Lieutenant.
no sign of Ben's car coming into Philly.
what route did you check?
garden State to the Walt Whitman and the Ben Franklin.
Ben was lying low, might've taken the 73 to 130, come in the back roads. Try the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge.
I, uh... just got word from the phone company.
the number Jeff texted belongs to Tammy Brown.
Vinnie Brown's daughter? - One and only.
must have been seeing each other all this time.
hiding it from their families.
get Tammy in here and grab a car.
you and Wi are going to Providence.
When'd you last see Jeff Foster, Tammy?
guess it was around September.
at a cross-country meet.
you guys hang out much?
no. I barely know him.
that's too bad.
cause you guys got a lot in common.
you both listen to Arcade Fire, both want to save the rain forest.
both got daddies in WITSEC.
we know he texted you today, Tammy. Where is he?
think you're protecting him by keeping quiet?
I have a constitutional right to remain silent.
constitution also says that if you know someone's going to commit a crime, makes you a co-conspirator.
looking at life in prison, even if you're not the one pulls the trigger.
where is he, Tammy?
I don't know.
he pulls a gun, the cops at the courthouse will shoot him dead, ask questions later.
looks like you're never gonna see that rain forest, much less save it.
break your daddy's heart.
wait.
I saw him last night.
we met at a friend's dorm room.
I can't believe you're really here.
I'm really here. - I missed you so much.
I sit in class and dream of all the places we talked about.
walking on the beach in Ko Samui...
hiking in Nicaragua...
breakfast in Bali...
deciding where to go next by spinning the globe.
we're never going anywhere, are we?
Yes, we are.
I promise.
what, you're gonna put us in some giant time machine, - rewrite history? - No.
I'm gonna fix things.
I don't want anything bad to happen to him.
fix things.
he talking about Ghiacconi?
Yes.
where is Jeff staying in Providence?
the Pilgrim's Landing Motel.
providence, Rhode island 6: 50am
the shower's still wet.
we just missed him. - Courthouse.
let's go.
GPS has him in a two-block radius.
it's got to be Ghiacconi.
always send the real one and a dummy.
ice, ice, baby.
he's on the move, Scotty.
heading north toward the courthouse.
send him a text.
Scotty, gray hoodie and jeans. That's him.
No! What are you doing?!
keep your head down, mouth shut and legs moving. Come on.
give it up, Jeff.
you ain't going nowhere.
who are you?!
Philly PD.
trying to save your life, stop you from doing something stupid.
my father was the star witness against that goombah.
he kills my dad, and now he's gonna walk? - Your dad videotaped his deposition.
Ghiacconi's not going anywhere.
he needs to pay for what he did!
and what, you spend the rest of your life in jail?
it'd be worth it. - Son, you may think you want revenge, but trust me, just tears you up.
what do you know about it?
I been there.
I just wanted to make things right.
until Ghiacconi's behind bars, we have to keep moving.
so it could be like this for years?
I hope not, but I don't know.
cape may, New Jersey September 21, 2008 5: 13 am
isn't this where you're supposed to tell me not to worry?
you've got it all worked out?
you're too old for fairy tales.
I wish Ghiacconi was dead.
it wouldn't change what I did.
if I could take it all back.
it's always your decision, always your plan:
where I go to school, what classes I take, what sports I do.
when do I get to choose?
you and your mother are everything to me.
I want us to stay together, get through this as a family.
but if you still want to go travel the world, I'm not gonna stand in your way.
what about Mom?
I'll get her on board.
give me a day or two to get you some money and a passport.
that's it? You're letting me go?
you've paid enough for your old man's mistakes.
I was all set to spin the globe, go wherever it landed.
but I decided to stay with my parents instead.
I never got the chance to tell my dad my decision.
spin the globe?
you saying Tammy was there with you?
she came down to the shore.
telling her I couldn't go away with her...
it was the hardest thing I'd ever done.
you two were gonna leave that night?
she was already packed. Even wrote a letter to her dad to say good-bye.
why didn't you tell us you were down the shore the night of the cross-country meet, Tammy?
I was afraid my father would find out I was gonna run away.
he'd kill me.
Where'd he think you were that night?
at the library studying.
after Jeff said he couldn't go away with me,
I checked my phone.
he'd already called, like, nine times looking for me.
What'd you tell him?
that I'd be home soon.
then I drove like a maniac back to Camden.
he there when you got home? - No, thank God.
I just tore up the letter I wrote him, flushed it down the toilet.
he never knew I was gonna leave.
please don't tell him, okay?
Ben's car turned up at a salvage yard in Whitman.
CSU found blood in the trunk.
Parker wanted in on the interview.
said Ben was his witness.
little late for the professionalism there, Tom.
I'm not giving this one up to the feds.
told him thanks, but I thought he'd done quite enough already.
the feds said if you testified against Ghiacconi, they'd keep you safe, out of prison.
didn't tell you what it would cost you, though, did they?
lost your wife, your friends.
not the bigspacone anymore, huh?
just another schmuck in a minivan.
you're all alone except for Tammy.
you'd do anything to keep her under your roof, wouldn't you, Vinnie?
where I'm from, girls live at home until they're married.
tradition.
but Tammy's a modern girl.
you know, curious about the world. Not the kind to stick around forever.
says you.
well, you found the letter she wrote you.
said she was leaving, going off to sail the world with Jeff Feldman.
don't know what you're talking about.
no more chicken piccata and High School Musicalfor you.
just you and a frozen pizza, staring at the wall like a caged rat.
detective, you got some imagination.
and no way you were gonna let her abandon you like that.
so you went down the shore looking for her.
but you found Ben first, didn't you?
last time I saw Ben was at the meet, just like I told you.
you thought you'd take one of the major bridges into Philly.
but if I had a body in my trunk,
I'd take the Tacony-Palmyra, too.
I got you driving a dead man's car.
phone records proving you called Tammy from Cape May that night.
got your minivan ticketed for overtime parking on Main Street in Cape May.
see, it's over, Vinnie.
talk second chances till you're blue in the face.
tigers don't change their stripes.
I need protective custody.
and I wanna see my daughter.
need it in writing.
where you gonna put me?
find a nice pen close to Tammy.
be difficult, and you're going to Rhode Island...
see just how vindictive Ghiacconi's crew can be.
I am a family man.
Tammy was all that I had left.
everything I did was for my daughter.
cape may, New Jersey September 21, 2008 8: 07 am
Where's Tammy?
what are you doing here, Vinnie?
I'm looking for my daughter.
why would she be here?
she left a letter saying she's going away with Jeff.
Ah, she's the girl he was trying to impress at the meet.
I found directions to the Cape May Motel on her computer. Now where is she?
I haven't seen her. I left Jeff a couple hours ago.
I gotta find her. Where, where's Jeff?!
Vinnie, calm down. You're gonna give yourself a heart attack.
I'm asking you a question.
Where's your son?
I'm not gonna tell you that, Vinnie.
what?
I'm letting him go.
this is no life for a kid.
if he wants to travel the world, I'm gonna let him.
you might wanna do the same.
so that's it?"See ya later. Bye?
our kids have suffered enough for our mistakes.
you're some kind of father.
well, I'm doing the best I can.
Where's Jeff?
son of a bitch!
honey?
Hey, Daddy, I just saw you called.
where are you? I've been looking everywhere for you.
I was just studying with some friends.
I'll be home soon, okay?
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event 1. 30. 1958
how'd you fare down at Fort Benning, Mr. Bellowes?
held my own, sir.
managed two degrees inside of five years.
studied straight through the summers, thanks to the GI Bill.
all while working part-time over at Dexter Broadman Advertising, I see.
I joined their creative side full-time after Wharton.
I'm surprised you want to write ads for our little family operation.
well, I'm not one for three-martini lunches, sir.
I have bigger ideas, and I know how to sell them.
such as?
well, Mr. Kemp, there's a housing shortage here in Philly.
I came out of the service with Uncle Sam backing my first mortgage and not a patch of ground in this city to plant my flag, and I am not alone.
I don't want to build high-rises.
I'm talkg about houses, sir.
neighborhoods of good men and their families.
I want to make you the Henry Ford of housing.
how exactly do you plan to do that?
well, I'd like to show you.
you're gonna have to take a ride with me.
last summer, blight wrecked the corn and potato crops as far as the eye can see.
there's 5, 500 acres sitting in the bargain bin.
get to the point, son.
cities are crowded, dirty... built on grids.
out here, the streets'll be peaceful, winding, named after colleges, flowers, pretty girls.
picture them lined with ranch-style houses.
out front, a bright-green yard and an apple tree.
we'll run a print campaign.
We'll-we'll open a... a showroom with plenty of fanfare, and we'll call it... Libertyville.
and when the good people of Libertyville want groceries, - a haircut or, God forbid, a school... - We build those, too!
shopping plazas with-with plenty of parking.
recreation centers where kids can play baseball.
it'll be a whole new way of life: the suburbs.
any thoughts on financing this boondoggle?
they'll buy on spec.
home ownership... is the cornerstone of the American dream.
it is what makes a man a man.
you trust me, sir.
we will sell out before we break ground.
Lilly, this is Mrs. Chisholm.
she's got information on a murder victim found out in Somerton in '58.
I'm Detective Rush.
hello. Thank you.
his name was Julian Bellowes.
met him when I first started out as a maid.
gracious young man. Worked for Harrison Kemp.
married the boss's daughter.
Harrison Kemp built Libertyville, big suburban development in Somerton.
is that where you met him?
no. The Kemps were members of the Senators Club in Center City.
that's where I worked.
place is a real "Who's Who.
the thing is, they said Julian was killed out in the boonies, - but I think it happened right there at the club. - Why is that?
the night before they found Julian, I was on my way to clean the Legacy Room after one of Mr. Kemp's business meetings when I saw Julian go back inside.
as soon as the door closes, a fight break out.
all kinds of yelling, glass breaking.
What'd you do? - Ran for help.
nobody around.
I got back... didn't hear a peep.
so I looked inside.
never saw a meeting end like that.
you know who else was in there?
got a list.
been thinking about it 50 years.
you tell your boss?
he said,"Clean up and shut up" if I wanted to keep my job.
Mrs. Chisholm, why did you wait so long to come forward?
just saw my doctor.
time to get my house in order.
if walls could talk, I'm thinking these wouldn't.
the manager says the room has barely changed in the last 50 years.
picking up on a theme here.
Mary said Julian walked through the door to find his killer waiting.
guy approaches. They get into it.
couple of swings right here.
somebody... crashes into this.
the glass Mary said she heard breaking.
this panel's different. Been replaced with safety glass.
old leaded stuff breaks in shards, would have crashed down.
evidence from 50 years ago... is hard to come by.
unless it has a place to hide.
I got it.
walls may not talk, but the floor's got something say.
residue... could be blood.
Mary's right.
whatever ended in that field started right here.
Libertyville. The American dream called home.
some American dream.
34-year-old Julian Bellowes, throat slit out in the middle of nowhere.
my aunt and uncle were Libertyville pioneers.
one night my Uncle Don has too much to drink and walks into the wrong house.
they all looked exactly alike.
the wife... Caroline Kemp. Handsome couple.
me says the victim's injury was caused by a serrated blade or glass.
the evidence you found in the Legacy Room could be our murder weapon.
so, he's killed at the club, then moved 15 miles to Libertyville?
no I-95 back then. Somerton was an hour's drive away.
felt like another planet.
couple of locals reported a drifter. Victim's wallet was missing.
assigned was thinking robbery.
a robbery on a farm in the middle of nowhere? How's that happen?
Julian's headed out there for business, picks up this drifter.
car was found near the body.
let's see if the lab can get a DNA sample from his wedding band, compare it to the glass samples we gave 'em.
anything from the list Mary Chisholm gave us?
maybe. Um, two people stood out.
Angelo Romano and his son Paul.
Yep. Those Romanos.
is that all we got?
Julian's at the Senators Club night before his body's found;
Kemps are lifelong members there; and not a single statement from the place?
no interviews with the victim's family, either.
why is this box so light?
good question, Lil. Let me know when you find out.
well, I have to admit I was surprised by your call.
the police didn't seem to pay attention when my husband was killed, never mind 50 years later.
hope to make up for that the second time around.
my mother was only 22 when he was killed. She was pregnant with me.
completely distraught and... not much use to the investigation, I'm afraid.
Oh, it was... it was a difficult time.
VALENS: There's no interviews from your husband's coworkers or family.
cops ever talk to you?
only to tell me that Julian had been murdered by a drifter.
your father was Julian's boss.
any idea why he wouldn't have given a statement?
are you saying there was some sort of misconduct?
no, we got some... blanks to fill is all.
well, Julian was estranged from his family.
he was close with mine. I guess silence was my family's way of grieving.
we' got a witness came forward.
heard your husband in a fight at the Senators Club night before he died.
he was at the club for a business meeting with these men.
recognize any of them?
well... there's... Paul Lomano.
isn't he the guy you were dating when you met Daddy?
a romance cultivated chiefly to drive my father around the bend.
no, it all changed the moment I saw Julian.
three's a crowd?
paul didn't have a chance.
cocktail?
Paul, not here.
it's my father's birthday, for heaven's sake.
so let's take a walk.
he's gonna be 60 all year, right?
maybe you'd like some champagne instead?
I thought I'd die of thirst.
I hate to think of you being neglected.
think I can look after my own date. Not from where I'm standing.
well, Paul doesn't cha-cha.
well, then he won't mind warming the bench now, will you, sport?
Caroline. - Daddy.
this is Julian Bellowes.
I see he beat me to an introduction.
you're the "Ivy League genius" my father's been raving about?
I was picturing Coke-bottle glasses.
well, I could go home and get 'em, if you'd like.
Julian grew up a stone's throw from Rittenhouse Square, graduated Wharton.
we have so much to talk about.
then shall we?
Julian made me feel like I was the only woman in the room.
we were engaged a month later.
I take it Paul wasn't too happy with your whirlwind romance.
Oh, he was angry, all right.
so angry he slashed Daddy's tires that night in the parking lot, right?
Julian was too much of a gentleman to call the police.
Caroline Kemp. She was a catch.
if you're into debutante types.
saying you didn't mind Julian Bellows making tracks with her?
making tracks?
the girl was a prude.
my dog Snowflake had a better sex life than I did when I was going with her.
so, why did you slash his tires?
big difference between slashing Goodyears and killing someone.
Yeah, except Julian's throat was slashed, too.
you making some kind of implication?
you got anger management issues with the guy, and I got a witness that puts you at a meeting with him the night before he's dead.
that's circumstantial.
here's a circumstance for you.
hear Romano Construction specializes in cement shoes.
we start sniffing around your sites, we gonna find a body fresher than '58?
truth is... I felt bad for the kid.
getting in bed with that Protestant family?
you meet those people?
they give you frostbite just looking at you...
30% off the top of my housing sales is unacceptable.
that's even more than last year.
we been supplying you quality building materials over 16 years.
without Romano Construction, you're nothing but blueprints.
Capasso Brothers in Camden is offering us a better price with no profit share.
the Capassos don't care about your safety the way I do.
we accept your offer.
what?
now listen here, Bellowes.
dad, he can't just come in here... - No, Harry. Not now.
go ahead.
we'll pay your cut on our builds in town in exchange for complete control of our profits in Somerton.
what, now you're going to sell horse manure?
you got a deal.
keep your spazzatura farmland and God bless.
for the Romanos, family is everything.
but not those people. Kemp-- he didn't even know his son left the room.
so, Julian was squeezing Harry out of the family business?
kid had the golden touch.
that, uh, farmland up in Somerton?
that's Libertyville now.
my father gets his cut, we'd be havin' this chat on my own private island.
you ever see Harry and Julian getting into it?
I saw Harry eating his heart out plenty, but it took Julian dying for Harry to get his seat back at the table.
can I help you?
Philly Homicide. Thought we'd congratulate you on your promotion to Vice President.
50 years late. 1960.
58, actually.
where were you, night before his body was found?
I don't remember. To be honest, I lost a couple of years in there.
two of you get along all right?
sure. He was my brother-in-law. Family, don't you know?
right. So, any chance you were with him at the Senators Club?
that's where he was.
uh... Told you I don't remember.
look at this. November 6, 1958.
got your autograph on a bar tab signeat midnight, same time a witness heard Julian fighting with someone in the Legacy Room.
that much gin will rot your gut, Harry.
does other things too... - I don't know where you're going with this.
Julian made us a fortune. What was good for Kemp and Sons was good for me.
well, the guy leapfrogs you to Vice President, gets tagd "Ivy League genius" by your father, and negotiates deals while you're... stammering on the sidelines.
that good for you?
slipping down the food chain like a clown on a Vaseline pole?
well, my ego got a little bruised, but I got over it.
besides, Julian did far worse to others.
so, we should have a contract in hand in under 15 minutes.
there's ladies in tears over the picture windows.
raw farmland, but they can already imagine the fruit trees.
give the people what they want, they stand in line for it, Harrison.
you think if we make you our vice president of sales, I can get you to call me Dad?
you're engaged to my daughter, after all.
I'd be honored... Dad. - Take your pick.
you and Caroline are going to need more room once you start a family.
early wedding present.
bunch of thieves stole my land! Been in my family over 200 years!
Juan Bellowes, Kemp and Sons.
save the sales pitch, mister.
con man! Convinced my senile old granddad to sign on the dotted line.
don't believe a word he says.
if it is land you want, it is land you'll get.
please.
please, let me see what I can do for you.
Julian was trying to make it right.
I mean, charming, full of ideas... Those attributes were lost on that hick.
old McDonald got a name?
Julian negotiated the deal.
and you decided not to tell the cops about this incident, even when Julian shows up dead in the same neck of the woods?
we were selling houses on spec.
if people thought we were robbing farmers of their land, it would have decimated sales.
VERA: Tracked down the families who sold their land to Kemp and Sons.
Casey Hollenbeck filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.
arrested in '62 for disorderly conduct.
guy spent his life raising and slaughtering livestock so, he would have known his way around a knife.
lived two miles from where Julian's body was found.
you, uh, check out any of those Libertyville homes while you were out there, Nick?
matter of fact, saw a few "for sale" signs. Might look into it...
well, interest rates are low... Time to act is now.
where is this Casey Hollenbeck today?
died in '94.
I'm looking for anyone who might have seen him at Julian's office.
Julian's secretary still around?
Yeah, uh, Joan Rasky. On her way in now.
lab report's back. DNA from the glass in the heating vent doesn't match Julian.
working on whose it might be. You have a swab from Harry?
paul Romano, too.
what? I'm not going to sit in the corner and knit.
pace yourself, Will. I don't want you busting a stitch.
got Julian's bank records.
guy wrote over $2, 000 worth of checks to cash.
100 bucks a week, every week leading up to his murder.
2, 000 clams. That's a lot of cash back then.
gambling, mistress, drugs.
or a payoff.
I worked with Mr. Bellowes from February of '58 until he passed away that November.
a farmer out of Somerton, uh, Casey Hollenbeck, had a gripe with Julian.
did he ever show up at Julian's office?
angry as sin.
but Mr. Bellowes patched it up with him, of course.
how did he do that?
well, he just explained that the city was sprawling north, whether he liked it or not, and he set his whole family up in Libertyville homes.
we found weekly checks made out to cash in his personal records.
any chance Julian was paying him off?
you know, I really don't have any information about his personal accounts, Detective.
Julian's gone, Joan, and the person who killed him might still be out there.
I put those checks in the mail once a week, but not to a Mr. Hollenbeck.
they were addressed to an R. Reynolds.
any idea who that was?
I didn't know, and I didn't ask.
and then, one day, the answer came walking in.
I'm really to see Mr. Bellowes.
your name?
Mrs. Regina Reynolds.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Reynolds. Do you have an appointment?
it's urgent.
Mr. Bellowes is behind closed doors at the moment.
well, you can let Mr. Bellowes know I am not one for causing a scene, but I am happy to give it a whirl.
there's a woman here to see you, Mr. Bellowes.
she's, um... a Negro.
what are you doing here? We have an agreement.
this can't wait. - Now is not the time.
I'll call you.
I promise.
so, you can imagine the scandal in 1958.
do you happen to remember the address you sent those checks to?
I do. I typed it so many times it's in the permanent file.
2221 Robman Street.
sorry I'm late.
thanks for joining me.
figured, as long as I was going to be in Philly, - well... I can't pass up Chinese.
remember this place?
brought you here when you were a kid.
used to have an aquarium by the door.
Oh, with the angelfish.
Christmas. We would come here at Christmas time.
red lanterns-- close as we were going to get to decorations.
still love the holidays.
Yeah. Sure.
you know, she didn't mess it all up.
one year-- I was six-- well, we skipped the Chinese, but not the gin, and...
and I helped her walk home, and she was so... sad.
said we didn't have any money for presents, but when we got home, there was this bike on the steps.
it was a red Huffy with a banana seat.
I don't know.
maybe she had some kind of pull with Santa.
why you looking at me like that?
ask Santa. I'm sworn to secrecy.
I loved that bike.
I, uh, went ahead and ordered.
you need a menu or you know what you want?
um, sesame noodles, Szechuan green beans and hot and sour soup.
something I said?
great minds think alike.
sesame noodles.
szechuan green beans.
guess the soup's still on its way.
eat before they get cold.
2221 Robman Street.
pissed-off white guy from work can't handle Julian's taste in women, follows him back to Regina's place.
white guy?
how do you think Regina's black husband was gonna take it?
his wife cheating on him with Julian.
you got a point.
yes?
few questions about Julian Bellowes.
remember him? - Remember him?
two of you were involved?
of course we were.
Julian was my brother.
our mother was Creole.
plenty of light-skinned folks in our community, but Julian was by far the lightest.
kids gave him a hard time for not being black enough.
made him a man without a country.
how were things at home?
Julian came back from the service living as a white man.
my father felt that he had lost his only son, but he never would have hurt him.
what was so urgent, had you showing up at his office?
our father was dying.
I wanted Julian to know.
Julian ever send you money? - Every week without fail.
think it eased his conscience.
of course, we would have traded every dime to have him around instead.
anyone you know find out what Julian was doing?
secret like that, it's bound to catch up with you.
I see you got married.
her name's Caroline.
she's a wonderful girl.
how much longer does he have?
doctor says we're at the end.
it's not too late, Julian. It's Daddy.
he won't want to see me.
Caroline's expecting.
we're gonna have a baby.
a baby? But what happens if...
I haven't been able to sleep in weeks.
Julian... you've got to get ahead of this.
lieutenant Bellowes.
george Watson from Fort Benning.
I think you're mistaken.
no mistake about it.
this is you, isn't it?
wife sure is pretty.
sure have done well for yourself, Lieutenant Bellowes.
is there something I can help you with? - Come to think of it, there is.
like to come to that office of yours sometime, catch up, talk business.
you have a card?
call first, all right?
that was the last time I saw him.
he never got a chance to say good-bye to my father.
george Watson. He the one with the carpet company? Seen his ads.
that's him. He was just getting started back then.
why didn't you tell the cops about this when you found out Julian was murdered?
I was a stranger at my own brother's funeral, wondering who all those people were, what they meant to him.
I realized that he belonged to them now.
and if that's the way he wanted it, I was going to honor his wishes.
when's the last time you saw Julian Bellowes, George?
in the service. Fort Benning, Georgia.
peacetime enlistment.
STILLMAN: A witness saw Julian give you his business card, Hot Skillet Diner,
south Philly, few weeks before he was killed.
you're right. Sorry, Detective, that was a long time ago.
anything in particular you wanted to discuss with Julian?
let me see.
um, I was interested in some work he was doing up in Somerton.
you wanted to buy a Libertyville property?
no, not at all.
I was interested in laying carpet in all those new builds.
we found your name in Julian's office phone records.
you left more than ten messages for him.
successful men don't take no for an answer.
that's the way I built my company.
any disciplinary issues when you were in the Army, George?
dug up your service record.
three non-judicial punishments in your first tour, all from Lieutenant Julian Bellowes.
George: W-Wait a second, now. He treated me fair.
same as the rest.
must have made you angry, seeing him in that diner, realizing the guy who'd been so tough on you was only pretending.
I was angry because he denied knowing me.
truth is, I'd known for a long time the secret he was hiding.
man, I don't know about that Army barber.
I mean, he gonna know what to do with my kitchen?
you seem to be in decent shape. Tell him to use the clippers.
private Bellowes.
Yes, sir?
soldier, how'd you get through school with grades like this and never learn how to check a box?
you marked "Negro" instead of "white.
excuse me?
you could've ended up on KP duty for the rest of your tour.
unless you'd rather peel potatoes than command a unit.
my mistake.
now report to Company First Sergeant in Processing before they close.
Yes, sir.
Julian had a choice, a way to be treated better.
who was I to stand in his way?
he ever give you that carpet contract you were after?
no. I guess he was afraid I would tell someone his secret.
I thought successful men didn't take no for an answer.
look, I didn't begrudge the man.
if I'd had the same choice, no idea what I would've done.
CAROLINE: Thank you.
ma'am? - The family I always wanted to meet.
he told me they had nothing in common.
they'd had a falling out over Julian's career plans.
seems something much bigger than that.
now that you know, it shed any light?
it explains what he was trying to tell me.
Julian... are you all right?
I'm fine.
you should go back to sleep.
can't remember the last time you weren't awake half the night.
is it about the baby?
are you nervous about becoming a father?
of course not.
is it about Harry?
what do you mean?
he's got the silliest thing stuck in his craw.
he had a conversation with Gene Reilly.
gene's a deacon over at All Souls.
it was so strange, but Gene says he's never heard of your family.
I told Harry he must be mistaken.
there's got to be more than one All Souls.
I know you don't like me to bring up your family, and I promised myself I'd stop asking, but... well, there's gonna be a baby.
your parents are gonna be grandparents.
and they made you.
which makes me love them.
there's so much that you don't know about me, Caroline.
you mean you don't actually like to cha-cha?
I'm serious.
there's nothing you could tell me that would make me stop loving you.
thank you.
I thought he was... he was worried about coming from modest means.
what a world we lived in that he felt he couldn't tell me the truth.
you said Harry was looking into Julian's past.
it possible he found out about your husband's secret?
my brother would have told me.
wouldn't he?
the hell you still doing here, Will?
could ask you the same thing.
fair enough.
lab results came back.
blood on the broken glass from the Legacy Room was Harry Kemp, Junior's.
night before he died, Julian was fighting with his brother-in-law.
Caroline said he had been looking into Julian's past.
sounds like it finally caught up with him.
well, last time we spoke, you stated you and Julian were pretty tight.
family, you said.
uh, that's right, yeah. - You got a little detective in you, Harry?
VALENS: Looking into Julian's past.
sniffing around the churchhe went to.
in 1958, where you went to church was your family's social circle.
I mean, when he told me that he went to All Souls, I...
you-you wanted to know where this cowboy rode in from.
looking for a crack in that smooth veneer of his.
Yeah, maybe. I... - You found out he didt go there.
never had.
guy lied to your father, your sister. Wonder why he'd lie like that, Harry?
I don't know.
you know, uh, my mom always warned me not to drink gin.
said it messed with your head, could make you do things you didn't mean to.
and you loved your gin martini, Harry.
tossing 'em back in the Legacy Room. Then Julian comes back.
told us it wasn't you fighting with him that night.
you want to stick with that story?
Julian's throat got sliced. Could have been broken glass.
so? - The blood on the pieces we found in the Legacy Room?
guess whose DNA.
you know, juries love that DNA evidence, Harry.
I was you, I'd start cooking up an alibi.
I didn't want to hurt him.
I just wanted the truth.
look, I know you've been talking to Caroline about me.
you got a problem with that, Julian?
she's my damn sister.
come on. I'm... I'm here to come clean.
you lied about where you grew up.
you lied about who you are.
who are you, you damn fraud?
okay. We'll talk when you're sober.
my father's betting everything on a con man while I'm stuck in the stockroom sharpening pencils!
I know you've gotten a raw deal ever since I showed up.
Yes.
but everyone deserves a shot to prove themselves, and I'm going to make sure your father gives you yours.
why the hell should I believe you?
I lied about who I was because I had to.
it was the only way for me to be myself and not be trapped by where I come from.
and wherthe hell is that?
Abyssinian Baptist is a couple of blocks north of here.
that's whe I was baptized.
that's where my whole family was baptized.
right there... is where I grew up.
my father is a carpenter.
his name is James Ridley Bellowes.
he's a Negro, Harry.
so am I.
you're related to them?
I'm their son.
you remember the old saw about judging a book?
does my sister know?
I'm gonna tell her next.
figured I'd start with my toughest customer.
what's the party for?
it's not a party.
they're saying good-bye to him.
who?
my father. He's dying.
why aren't you in there with them?
there's something I got to make right.
when I do, that's when I can go home again.
I don't know. He dropped me off, drove me home.
never saw him again.
anyone else find out? Your father maybe?
Julian's death destroyed Dad.
I got the feeling he wished it had been me instead of Julian.
so I told him the secret.
you never saw tears dry up so fast.
don't tell Caroline. That's all he said.
went in his office, shut the door, started working the ones.
well, who was he calling?- Well, his high-placed friends.
put a lid on the whole investigation.
VALENS: Julian said there was something he needed to make right before he could go home again?
you know what that was?
Yeah, he wanted to integrate Libertyville. He'd already implemented the idea.
well, how so? - A few weeks before his death, he preapproved a loan for a mortgage.
the first black family.
you remember who they were?
no, I never did know.
took another 25 years for the first black family to move into Libertyville.
Libertyville handled its own mortgage applications.
you still got those records?
there's a storage facility and 50 years of paperwork.
you dig, Harry. I'll watch.
give me a shot at this guy, John.
doc said restricted duty.
the only thing that's gonna cure me is doing my job.
go on. Get in there.
Rush: Told us you had no interest in a Libertyville home, George.
look what we found.
a mortgage application for a model called The Philadelphian.
that you, George?
well, that-that looks like my signature.
Rush: This is where it says you've been preapproved.
whose name's that?
it's Julian Bellowes.
JEFFRIES: What happened, George? Know you never lived there.
I don't remember. A long time ago.
well, mortgage was being set up at Emerson Mutual, uh, Center City branch.
everything was going through.
until that morni, November 7, 1958.
when you went to the bank to pick up your check, they told you you couldn't have that loan after all.
I ilt my company from scratch.
12 stores in the tri-state area. Ads on televion.
had your wife with you.
must have been hard, having them tell you they'd changed their mind right in front of her.
put three kids through college without help.
did it all myself.
JEFFRIES: Look, reversing your application like that.
I know what happened.
they saw the color of ur skin.
keep your grs mowed and kids on point, smile friendly and never complain.
still... the neighbors are nervous.
I know.
I lived next door to 'em myself.
I know exactly what you would have done if you had the choice Julian Bellowes had.
hell, George, we both would have done the same damn thing.
taken it.
Yeah.
black or not, Julian had no idea what it was like for men like you and me.
he set me up for a fall.
made you promises he couldn't keep.
out front, a bright green yard and an apple tree.
a neighborhood of good men and their families.
I just wanted what was fair.
what every other qualified vet was getting when they can home.
a piece of the American dream.
all right, I know it doesn't look like much, but Phase 5 is going to be our best project yet.
I brought the sketches for you.
we're going to put a kidney-shaped pool right...
what the hell's the matter with you, huh?
your bank rejected me!
what do you mean? I personally approved your application.
my wife got herself a new dress.
wanted to look her best.
bank manager takes one look at us, then starts talking about some clerical error!
just calm down, George.
I will call him myself, and I will straightethis out.
she cried all the way home.
nothing I could say made a bit of difference.
I let down my family because of you!
the policies are wrong.
no matter how hard I work,
I can't make my life look like it looks in one of your ads.
if I got to lend you the money myself, I will.
you think I want your charity, huh?
I got my own down payment and the monthly.
I just can't get a break.
I understand.
you have no idea what I'm talking about!
I caught more than my share of hell for the color of my skin.
most of it from my own people.
what, you blaming us now, huh?
cause we can't snap our fingers, skip to the head of the line like you did?
there's not a day that I have not regretted that decision.
this is my fight, too. - How dare you?! Huh?
running around, pretending to be a white man, and now you want to be my brother?
what you are is a disgrace.
1932/5/19
rose, stay put, all right? And keep your head down.
you never know what these darkies will try and pull.
wait, Curtis. You hear that music?
take it easy, all right? Crank that window up.
Collins, where you been? I'm damn near dry in here.
I can't help it. I got wide demand.
Hey, chickadee.
watch it, buddy.
rose Collins, get in the dang car!
What're you aping at anyway?
I ain't. I'm not.
looking.
commercial diver checking for sewage leaks found this truck with a body in it.
dredged it up from the Delaware this morning. - Was it down there long?
I'd say so. - No kidding.
guy in my neighborhood had one of these vintage jobbies.
spray you with a garden hose if you got close to it.
and how old we think it is? - It's gotta be early '30s.
the headlights mounted on the bar, not the fender? Means it's pre '35.
we'll get an exact year when we match up the plates and vin number.
truck was halfway stuck in the mud.
kept them bones from getting turned into sand.
we got a reason to think it wasn't just bad driving?
about a dozen.
CSU has something that might explain the reason for the bullet holes.
remains of a glass jug and copper tubing found underneath the seat.
tubing for what? - Add sugar and rubbin alcohol, Lil, you're making moonshine.
bootlegging. Hot.
70 years dead. - Nice and cold for you.
could be our new record.
I called in a favor with auto squad.
1931 Dodge pickup. Registered to a Curtis Collins.
could this Collins be our bones? - Nah, he's accounted for.
in fact, guy's still kicking it at a retirement place in Haverford.
Lil and Vera are on their way out there.
we know if he ever reported his truck stolen? - Nope.
because Curtis Collins had good reason to keep the cops far away from his truck.
it's like we thought.
picked up twice for illegal distribution of alcohol and violation of the 18th amendment.
Curtis Collins, bona fide bootlegger.
and the truck was the company car.
glad we brought you a challenge for once, Frannie?
outside of paleontology camp, this is the oldest body I've ever worked on.
you able to get anything from what's left? - Fractured skull was the cause of death.
from a gunshot? - Probably the accident.
what else?
we got the skull and pelvis, so I can tell you the victim was female.
late adolescent to young adult. - A girl?
had to be some lady bootleggers, right?
this can't be good.
did you lose a truck around 1930?
sure. You making reparations?
it was dredged up from the Delaware this morning.
no kidding.
had bullet holes all over it and a body inside.
a body?
you don't say.
any idea who that was?
good chance that's my sister in there. Rose.
what makes you think that?
she ran off with my truck, August of '32.
and you're just now thinking she might be dead?
when I couldn't find her back when, I thought she didn't want to be found.
you two on bad terms?
no.
our father killed himself after the bank took his store, mother was long dead.
leaving you in charge.
can you think of anyone who'd want to hurt her?
no.
other than refusing to heed me, Rose was sweet as honey. Light up a room.
took a peek at your file, Curtis.
selling moonshine was a dangerous business.
that earn you some enemies?
guess so.
cause as a young businessman, I sure wasn't sweet.
reach over for your brother and turn that engine off, girly.
easy there, Doc Win.
had a nip of that gasoline you trying to pass off as whiskey.
tastes like you ran it through with fertilizer.
the only fertilizer here's the lice you're dropping, Doc.
I'm about done dealing with you, Collins.
this block is my territory and I am fierce in protecting it.
you won't find another outfit willing to supply you.
unless you're dead and gone. Then we'd all celebrate.
please don't hurt him! Take, take another jug!
dang it, Rose! What'd I say to you?
stay out of it, doll-face.
I know you're not talking to my sister familiar.
what if I am? - You do not talk to her.
calm down and leave the girl out of it.
Fertilizer-tasting or not, the hooch is half the draw of this place.
other half being the entertainers, and they all need the hooch to get in touch with the muse.
go serve it up, why don't you?
let's not talk business in front of the females.
I'll catch up with you another time.
friend.
so this Doc Win thought you were selling him an inferior product.
there were fellas making liquor out of hair tonic.
least I put corn syrup in the mix.
and Doc Win didn't see you being decent that way.
not at all.
so if Rose was in your truck, maybe some of your business contacts thought they were offing you instead.
Yeah.
well, Doc Win knew the truck.
always said it rattled a particular way. Irked him.
we know this is a stretch, Celia, asking you about your great-grandfather.
doc Win's a legend in our family. I've been hearing about him my whole life.
he had a beef with a guy named Curtis Collins, a bootlegger.
Curtis's truck was pulled up out the Delaware today with a body inside.
we think it may be his sister. - And you think Doc had something to do with that.
possible.
her name was Rose Collins.
ring any bells?
the name, no. But the face from Doc's album...
this is the same girl, right? - It is. Sure.
I've looked at this picture so many times.
you know anything about this girl?
my grandma used to tell me stories that Doc told her.
my favorite was about this night when Billie Holiday came to play Doc Win's.
what do you think of this one, Billie?
she ain't bad. She's got my name. That's in her favor.
Oh, no.
your brother know you're here? - No.
please don't toss me out because of him.
I got money to buy drinks just like she does.
a cordial, please.
hello.
Bible study's out the door, three blocks down.
I'm here for the music.
watch out. She don't sing about lollipops and flowers.
this ain't no place for you. Why don't you go on home?
I need to listen a while.
pardon me.
could I try one of your cigarettes?
fresh out.
dang it!
my hat was off.
how come your mother lets you dress like a boy?
I do what I please, first off.
and I ain't dressed like a boy.
I'm dressed like a fox.
doc Win, you gotta go give this Sunday-best-wearing white girl her very first cigarette while I'm trying to listen?
why don't you hit the skids? - I have a drink I paid for.
now shoo, fly, and don't come back.
story was Rose was the first white girl to come to Doc Win's.
lured in by the music.
doc said it was a testament to the blues being universal.
and who was this Billie giving Rose a hard time?
one of the regular customers. Read in the club's poetry readings, too.
can we hold onto this album a little while?
sure.
and I've got boxes of Doc Win memorabilia that I've been meaning to go through.
if I find anything else, I'll give you a call.
so Rose Collins might've been the type to stick her nose where it didn't belong.
she definitely wasn't welcome at Doc Win's.
looked at the old ledgers. Doc Win's wasn't a good girl's kind of place.
cops arrested people there every weekend.
shady clientele?
drunks, women of ill-repute, artist types.
so maybe Rose goes back to Doc Win's and this Billie, or someone else there, takes issue with her.
Hey. I did some more looking at your girl's skull. - And?
there's no nasal sill, the little bone at the base of the nose.
nose bone mean something? - It's one of the ways to determine race from skeletal remains.
your victim was African American.
well, Rose Collins is still alive.
no kidding.
living somewhere up in Manhattan. Got a last known address.
you find a name for our bones?
so far, six young black women, disappeared or assumed dead around '32.
saved that stack for you. - It's a birthday present.
when's your birthday? - Tomorrow.
how you celebrating? - I'm 60. I'm almost dead.
I'm going home tonight, writing out my will.
okay.
most interesting name I found, Nickname Billie.
the girl from Doc Win's. - Check out her mug shot.
looks like she thinks this whole arrest thing's funny.
girl had a close relationship with Philly PD.
age 12, juvenile division picks her up for curfew violation.
age 14, engaging in illegal possession of liquor.
16, arrested for causing a public disturbance by wearig men's pants.
she sure liked her boy's clothes.
she was getting in scrapes pretty regular till summer of '32.
then no more. Great aunt files a report when Billie drops off the map.
into the Delaware? - Best answer so far.
maybe Rose can give us more.
we thought you'd be harder to find, Rose.
seeing as your brother thought you might've died in '32.
I ran away that year.
Curtis and I haven't talked since.
70 year sibling squabble.
you got me beat.
he and I never got on. He wanted me under his thumb like a kid.
I wanted to live.
we got some questions go way back, Rose.
you remember a woman named Billie Ducette?
sure. She was a character.
any idea how she could've wound up in your brother's truck.
august of '32?
I lent it to her.
you and Billie were friendly?
because we heard she hassled you, the night Billie Holiday played Doc Win's.
she did.
but after that, we became friends.
so she borrowed your truck, and disappeared?
I thought maybe she took off for New York and knowing what Curtis would do if he found out she had his truck,
I followed her to get it back.
and that's how you wound up here? - I never found her, though.
I was gonna go home to Philly, but I, uh...
I met a Wall street man.
and he became my husband.
you remember Billie having any enemies?
she was saucy. Had her share of rifts with people.
anyone who'd go so far as to shoot at her?
you've heard the expression "a woman scorned"?
sent that girl away a night ago, and don't she know it's been ashes
sent her away and don't she know it ache
heart of mine, throat of smoke,
I sent a girl away and it's been hell opened up, working on my skin till it be bone.
you're wearing a skirt.
I clean house. They make me.
well...
well, what? That about me?
it's one of my originals.
how I express my truest thoughts through poetry.
I got one of my poems published in a magazine.
you heard of opportunity?
published by W. E.B. Dubois?
who's that?
wasn't them chose me anyhow.
they will when I move to New York.
was this other outfit, equally prestigious, you know.
paid me two dollars. - Gee...
you come back to the club, I'll buy you a real drink using my poem earnings.
thought you didn't want me there.
all right, listen.
I go with this girl, little Georgie and she's batty.
you go with a girl?
they're a headache, but that's my taste.
I have a beau.
a boy.
your boy get jealous? - Sure. He's a hothead.
little Georgie's got a pistol in her purse and I've seen her use it.
you saying she'd use it on me? - If she came in, saw us jawing.
but I broke it off with her.
told her I got the right to new friends if I want them.
will you teach me how to smoke?
will you teach me how to dance?
Yeah, all right.
Oh, no.
step in there.
that her? - She followed me. You ought to go.
you stop in your tracks! - And put some speed on it.
so...
Billie had a thing for you.
at first. Which was scandalous to me.
but you still became friends.
I was taken by the way she lived.
so free. - Wearing pants.
smoking and cursing and not caring who protested.
and this little Georgie was her jilted ex?
Billie said just ignore her but,
I couldn't stop thinking about the pearl-handled pistol she carried.
you in my view, boys.
got to interrupt your vacation for a minute, little Georgie.
What'd you call me?
we meet in another life?
let's talk about that life.
you remember a girl named Billie Ducette?
Oh, no.
that hurts.
back when, that girl bruised my heart and good.
and what'd you do in revenge? - Revenge?
not my way.
you stabbed a lady in '43 and spent five years in prison.
woman got in the way of me and my dance moves.
would it surprise you to hear Billie was killed back in '32?
death don't surprise me.
there were gunshots in the back of the truck she was found dead in.
and we know you had a fondness for using your pistol.
Billie had enough trouble coming her way. Didn't need mine.
what kind of trouble we talking about? - Worst kind.
kind that comes with being sweet on an innocent, little white girl.
hit me again, Doc.
I can still feel my damn heart beating.
I never slow-danced before.
Ted doesn't like dancing.
you like it?
in New York, you can go to 10 clubs like this in a single night.
that'd be nice. Dancing all night.
I bet we'd have fun there.
you know what kind of a place this is?
you got to be out of your mind.
you've been drinking. - My brother's a bootlegger, Ted.
been bound to happen.
you being lippy just then?
that's the hooch and it don't suit you.
you were supposed to say,"can I cut in?
so this is the one.
my pal saw you two outside st. Abigail's.
she's a queer, Rose.
and she brought you down here to get you sauced and take advantage.
no, no. - You the one that don't dance?
man can't move his feet's a man can't move...
when it counts.
drinks is on me everybody!
you hear about any fallout from this Ted situation?
but not too much after's when Billie took a powder.
you mean, was killed.
guess that's right.
tell you what.
men do not like having another woman as romantic competition.
okay.
seen a few of these scenarios first hand and they are right ugly.
so this Ted guy, Rose's boyfriend?
dead and gone.
still might be the doer. Aced Billie for eyeing his girl.
happy bihdhday, Will.
Yeah, yeah.
give yourself a present, man. Go see her tonight.
who? - Lena. Singer at this club.
I'm staying in tonight.
I'll go with you, wingman.
forget it.
got cigars and guitars at home. That's all I need.
Celia Watson dropped this off.
mementos from Doc Win's?
literary magazines.
to Rose.
an original poem by Billie Ducette.
maybe something in one of these gives us a clue to how she died.
so we got to make sense of, "oh, ripest fruit, pink and hidden,
I've traveled wet, sweaty miles to find you.
sounds like Billie visited Rose's school again.
to Rose, whose breathing is blooming,
school bell shocks my heart into moving
springtime sends green roots through my veins,
my eyes are dusted off, my blood is searching,
at the bell, I'm born again, through the earth aching,
Moon-faced girl, you are the only one I see.
sounds like Billie was smitten. - What about Rose?
she said they were just friends.
this makes it sound like more than that.
those three words I have never heard together
those three words I have never heard together,
before you made them in your mouth,
chewed them soft like sugar cane,
polished them with your tongue,
gave them to me sweet," "and I swore I'd never get them lost.
is it how I can't find sleep, or get fed, this thing you said?
is it how my heart grows at the sight of you?
then, baby, yes,
I love you, too.
rose told Billie she loved her. - We sure these aren't just Billie's fantasies?
she said it was her truest self she wrote in her poems.
okay, well, this one ain't pretty.
date on it, August 1932.
close to when Billie disappeared.
what's it called, Nicky?
my body broken.
tired, nickel-colored night
you can take my blood and keep it,
I ain't need it no more,
use my broken teeth to pave your street,
my splintered bones stomped for sand,
if this lead-footed man should once again leave me dead,
my body broken,
my soul would find a way,
Oh, night, to dance with his girl again.
someone beat up Billie, left her for dead.
someone whose girl she stole.
possible Billie stole a lot of girls in her day.
she calls him "lead-footed," like he can't move his feet.
maybe dead Ted.
the bad dancer.
rose didn't tell us Billie got beat up over her. - She didn't mention love poems, either.
didn't want to own up?
I can't picture my grandma owning up to something like this.
back to the Big Apple.
best friends. That's what we were.
that's all?
rose, someone hurt Billie pretty bad a few nights before she died.
that your boyfriend, Ted?
Yes.
all because you and Billie were friends, huh?
rose, she wrote you love poems.
you have them?
Yeah.
I'm a great-grandmother.
my family doesn't know. - We're talking to you, not your family.
I was 17.
I didn't know what it was. I just knew I wanted to be around her.
you had feelings for her?
there's a book in my desk, the drawer on the left.
with the violet cover.
writings from my teenage years.
you're a poet, too. - Oh, just that summmer.
I tried to write my own poems. I was trying to be just like Billie.
I was terrible, of course.
I came up from the dark without you,
and every day since has been in shadow.
I thought Billie brought me out of the dark.
showed me the light.
what happened when Ted beat her up?
it made me realize how much I felt.
you think he broke anything, Billie?
look at me.
he told me I come near you again, he'll kill me.
but I gotta come near you, Rose.
he won't kill you. It's crazy.
don't you see how it goes? It ain't easy for us.
hold still.
hold still, will you?
it's okay, it's okay.
I got a plan so we can be together.
we'll go to New York.
we ain't got no money. - Sure, we do.
look around.
we got lots.
after that, I knew Curtis would kill me, so we, we had to go.
to New York.
that was the plan.
Billie was gonna take the truck and liquor, pick me up at school.
but she never made it?
I took a bus to New York in the morning.
I tried to find her.
rose, why were you so afraid of your brother?
after our parents died, Curtis became fixated on me.
he, he wanted us to be together forever.
he never would have let me go.
and you think he caught Billie stealing the truck?
what would he do to her?
if that happened...
I'm sure she would have been killed.
my sister's dead.
no, she's in New York. Alive.
you got it wrong. - How would you know, Curtis?
you lost touch in '32.
I just know, is all.
answer me a hypothetical.
back in the days when you weren't so sweet, what would you do if you caught someone lifting your moonshine?
shoot them. - Did you shoot Billie Ducette?
I don't know who that is.
sure you do.
she broke into your shed, stole your hooch, your truck.
you chased her, shot at her, ran her off a bridge.
that's poppycock.
what about someone stealing your sister?
what would you do to them?
watch that mouth.
Billie Ducette becoming a little more vivid to you now?
I didn't shoot that thing.
what's that? - The one poisoned my Rose.
ain't kill her, but Rose had to step in.
what the hell are you doing? - Looking for leaks.
stop it! - I caught myself a thief, Rose!
Curtis, leave her alone!
you gone bughouse? She's stealing from us.
I love her!
you what?
love her. Please let her go.
you better watch what you're saying, Rosie.
you don't know what she is. - Yes, Ido.
I know it through and through.
don't you say that to me!
no.
Oh, lord. No. I tried to raise you right!
I tried, but you slipping off.
I'm your heart, Rose. I know that you know that.
but you let this thing get in your mind like a maggot.
it's all right, baby. - Don't talk to her!
you gotta choice is what.
you cannot be loyal to this thing and be part of this Collins family.
rose. - Which one?
blood or this?
me or this?
I'm gonna put her out of her misery.
now, go get my gun out of the truck. Now!
go get it!
you're not my family, you sorry son of a bitch.
Billie, get in the truck.
I guess good-bye.
I took my plymouth and drove after them.
shot at them? - Emptied my gun.
but they kept on.
so how did the truck end up in the river?
bridge was out because of the rains.
I saw the sign, slowed down.
and the girls?
hit the bridge...
going full-bore.
that's, that's what's scrambling my brains, see.
you saying Rose is alive.
because she was in that truck.
they both were.
and I...
I saw it...
go off of that bridge.
I don't know why, exactly. The last couple of days,
I feel short of breath at home.
I know that feeling.
fresh air helps.
we talked to your brother about your theory he killed Billie.
he gave us something else.
he told us you were in the truck, Rose.
when it went off the bridge. - That's not possible.
I would've died.
yet here you are.
I was not in that truck.
I was waiting for Billie.
I was alone.
right.
so there was no plan.
you never loved her. - You never healed her.
you never came up from the dark without her?
came up from the dark without you
and every day since has been in shadow.
dark is the water.
this is about the accident, isn't it?
you gave us this poem, Rose.
you want to tell us.
water, love, guilt.
death.
I'm no writer.
but she was.
and that's why you wrote this.
for Billie.
I wondered if it was wrong, the feelings I had for her.
no.
it was just the wrong time.
all these years I've carried her with me.
what happened that night?
in the truck?
I betrayed my girl.
how?
I lived.
baby, hold tight. - He's gonna kill us!
he's gonna follow us all the way to New York and track us down like dogs.
let me out, then.
it's me he's after. You blow on out of here.
no, he'll kill you. - I'm not scared, Rose.
no. We can make it.
it's closed off.
no, no, no, no.
we ain't getting away from him now, Rose.
I know. But he's not taking you away from me.
you love me? - Baby, what are you doing?
I'm your girl, right? - You're my girl and I love you.
how'd you like to love me forever?
Yes.
okay.
all right, then that's what we'll do.
I came up from the dark without you
and every day's been in shadow.
I have begged the tide to wash away my sin
and take me to you in the dark
but every day I surface again.
but in the spring, I am betrayed by the new earth
with you in my heart, I am born again a green bud,
I am born again blooming.
1975/8/13
tell mama I'm going to play.
you better be home before the streetlights come on, girl.
fireflies turn into fairies at the end of summer.
why fairies?
cause, they do.
you made that up.
you never see fireflies in the winter, right?
in Brooklyn, we never saw them ever.
cause they turn into fairies, that's why.
yeah? And go where?
their castle in the sky, where nothing ever dies.
but not all fairies make it.
why not?
cause the trolls catch them.
where do the fireflies really go, Melanie?
I don't know.
my brother said when summer ends, you won't play with me anymore.
Why?
cause you're white, and I'm black.
but we're best friends.
forever? - Forever and a day.
maybe when summer ends, the fireflies go to heaven.
Yeah, maybe.
let's get forensics in here, see if they can pick anything up.
Lil. - Morning, boss.
what do you got?
ever hear of a letter arriving 31 years too late?
too late for what?
save the life of a young girl.
former postman lived here?
died last week.
refused to deliver mail to blacks on his route back in '75.
welcome to the U. S.Postal service.
his family found bags of mail stashed in the basement.
the inspector's been sifting for hours.
this was in one of them.
from an eight-year-old girl, Melanie Campbell.
went missing in '75.
body never found. Presumed homicide.
postcard's addressed to her best friend, next door neighbor, Cherise Pierce, black girl. Take a look.
the trolls got me.
some kind of message?
it was postmarked the day Melanie disappeared.
cry for help.
31 years too late to save her.
maybe not too late to catch her killer.
Melanie campbell, age eight.
abducted from her bedroom, night of october 23, 1975.
her bloody ballet shshoe found in a nearby park.
Tender-age search.
lots of time, manpower on this one.
body never recovered.
theory was an intruder came in through a broken basement window.
a postcard was sent to her neighbor, Cherise Pierce.
never made it.
these kids were tight.
best friends, hung out 24/7.
not the only Pierce in here.
prime suspect at the time was Cherise's teenage brother, Terrell Pierce.
based on what?
kid had no record, straight-a student, Mr. Clean.
neighbor id'd Terrell in the Campbells' backyard, night of the abduction.
in these words: "Saw that colored boy monkeying around on the side of their house.
that's credible.
lifted a partial palm print from the Campbells' basement window.
no match to Terrell.
didn't stop them from interrogating him.
six times.
parents were questioned, too, but dismissed as suspects.
cause once the black kid was id'd, it was all about him.
brewery town was lily-white back then.
pierces were the first black family to move in.
that some kind of excuse?
not an excuse, the times.
aka white flight.
families hightailing it to the burbs, terrified that their property values would tank.
one way to spin it.
at least one white family stayed: The Campbells.
families of missing kids do that, refuse to move.
Yeah, waiting for their child to walk through the door.
Lily's gonna talk to the parents.
you want to take Cherise and Terrell?
sure.
could be Terrell didn't deserve any of this.
neither did Melanie.
the trolls got me.
it was addressed to the girl next door, Cherise Pierce.
you think Melanie wrote that?
possibly. Could "the trolls" have meant something?
Melanie was always going on about fairies and trolls and fireflies.
quite an imagination.
but it was just child's talk.
Melanie did not write this.
how do you know?
she just started the third grade, and she didn't know cursive.
of course Melanie wrote that. These are her words.
but anyone who heard her playing would've known them.
who wrote it, then?
maybe the person who took her.
what kind of a monster would do a thing like that?
that's what I'm here to find out, Mrs. Campbell.
so you'll find Melanie, too? - Oh, Frances.
she is alive.
it's been 31 years.
I don't care if it's 131 years.
Melanie is out there.
can I walk you out?
we are prisoners in this house because my wife believes our daughter's gonna walk through that front door.
just thought you should know we're reopening the case.
all I want is to bury my child.
I understand.
then bring her home.
it was a lifetime ago.
I barely remember that girl.
you were best friends back when blacks and whites didn't exactly mix.
take a look around.
still don't.
I know you probably got an unfair shake in '75.
probably?
cops had me in the box for 16 hours at a time.
that's rough.
should've seen the '50s and '60s, you want to talk rough.
you were id'd in the girl's yard the night she disappeared.
by an old busybody who thought blacks should go back to Africa.
so that was a flat-out lie?
flat-out.
talk about you and Melanie.
like I said, it was long time ago.
the trolls" mean anyone in particular?
could be the difference between finding Melanie's killer or not.
trolls were people we didn't like.
go on.
we had codes for everything.
I'd say something like: "Alvina lights a spark.
Alvina lights a spark?
code for: "I left a note on our clothesline.
so who were the trolls?
almost everyone.
our friendship wasn't looked on too kindly.
by who?
the whole neighborhood had it out for us, from the start.
everyone except Melanie.
Leave...!
get out of here, critters!
Leave...!
what does "critters" mean, Terrell?
dad told you to go inside, Cherise.
Critters" means bugs and stuff.
Oh.
want to see my fireflies?
are those...bugs?
their booties light up at night.
they do. Like magic.
I mean, if you believe in that stuff.
quit talking to that girl!
go home, Melanie!
you're not the boss of me, Mr. Wilson!
I told you to go home. Now!
Leave...!
my mom said you can come over after dinner.
I live right here.
we can catch fireflies when it gets dark.
okay.
see you later, alligator.
after a while, crocodile.
quite a welcoming committee.
courtesy of Hank Wilson, head of the civic club.
civic club? More like a lynch mob.
racists parading around as neighborhood associations.
who was this bozo?
he owned the local hardware store.
to him, the only thing worse than us were whites who didn't go along.
like Melanie.
our friendship might have cost her her life.
it was our neighborhood, not theirs.
your family was there for 30 years, then, here come the coloreds.
and to make matters worse, little melanie campbell gets all buddy-buddy with the black girl.
could make a die-hard racist like you blow a gasket.
whoa, hold on there.
when Melanie disappeared, all the white people got spooked, moved out.
had to sell my house at a loss.
boo-hoo.
we were working people.
house was all we had.
beat up your own kid regular for looking at you funny.
what's that got to do with anything?
maybe you let the fists fly with Melanie.
lippy little kid must have pissed you off.
I was working at the hardware store the night she disappeared.
we'll check that.
go ahead, and while you're at it, check out a guy by the name of Wes Floyd.
who's he?
real estate scumbag that was creeping around the neighborhood back then.
tried to scare all the white folks into moving.
Why? So he could clean up?
type like that would do anything for a buck.
you hear about that break-in the other day?
right down the street.
thank goodness no one was hurt.
imagine what would happen if that family was home?
that's terrified!
known fact-- blacks move in, crime goes up.
 bad things happen to decent people.
well, we all know one another here.
Oh, for now, sure, but once the dam breaks, no stopping who comes in.
you don't want to be the last to leave, do you?
I guess not, but...
place like Genessee creek offers a safe environment for families like yours.
state-of-the-art kitchens. Big yard. A pool.
this heat, a pool would be nice.
huh?
don't you fall for it, Frances!
get out of here.
I know what you're doing.
just doing business.
showing the nice lady the homes I have for sale.
you're trying to scare whites out of this neighborhood, but nobody here's leaving.
except the spooks over there.
it's our neighborhood.
sure it is.
my husband would never agree.
neighborhood's gonna tip one day soon, and you'll be the last white face around.
not if I can help it.
and if one bad thing happens to some nice little white kid?
won't be up to you.
his houses in the suburbs weren't selling worth squat.
then Melanie disappears and he makes a killing.
neighborhood tipped in, like, eight seconds.
thanks for sharing.
now get before I drop-kick you out of here.
Genessee creek.
it's that Tony subdivision over near abington.
lots of people made a killing off of white flight.
sounds like this wes Floyd guy was one of them.
I see your real estate ads all over the place, Wes.
bus stops, billboards.
I do well.
and to think, it all started with Genessee creek and the abduction and murder of a little girl.
I'm a businessman, not a killer.
you made out like a bandit after Melanie Campbell disappeared.
sold 12 homes in one week.
they say you make your own luck.
maybe you made yours.
the timing was fortuitous, so arrest me.
already have a record, Wes.
silly trespassing charges for putting a few "sold" signs in people's yards.
to make it look like people were moving when they weren't.
smashed a few windows, too.
made people think crime was going up.
scare them out of Brewery town into your white suburb.
it was business.
and it was the neighbors that had it out for Melanie, not me.
neighbors like who?
the kibbitz on that block.
saw the troubles myself at the bus stop.
fairies like sweet stuff.
like honey?
what if we put some in a jar?
Yeah, and if they like it...
first day of school and Melanie's already got a show-and-tell.
you gonna talk jive for us, huh? Dy-no-mite.
shut up, Dale.
come on, Mel, we don't got to listen to him.
What'd you say, darkie?
Um...nothing.
then say you're sorry. Or I'm gonna smack you.
like your daddy smacks you?
second thought...
maybe Melanie should get in the first lick.
hit her. - No.
hit her. - Stop it!
hit her! - I said stop!
little bitch.
come on.
stupid troll.
saw that kid picking on the little ones all the time.
you know his name?
Dale Wilson. Hank Wilson's son.
Runt-of-the-litter type.
humiliated by a little girl.
infront of the other kids.
and if Dale was anything like his pops, not exactly the forgiving and forgetting type.
how'd it make you feel, Dale?
getting popped by Melanie Campbell in front of everybody.
not long after, she goes missing.
I was just young, dumb.
can't argue there.
held back twice.
so? That don't mean nothing.
your old man was damn near burning crosses on lawns back then.
you telling me you didn't get even?
I'm not my father.
sure acted like him at that bus stop.
and I felt bad about it.
no one knew better than me what it's like getting picked on by someone twice your size.
Oh, so you just let it pass, then?
let bygones be bygones?
I went to Melanie's house the next day.
to even the score?
to apologize.
we can leave notes to each other here from now on.
where no one'll see 'em.
in the storm pipe? - Yeah.
what are you doing?
get away from us, Dale.
I'm sorry for what I did, okay?
sorry to both of us?
Yeah.
now get down from there before you hurt yourself.
why are you crying?
my mom took down the clothesline.
she said we can't play together anymore.
her mom said they're going to move, too.
Why?
cause the neighbors don't like fireflies and bugs and stuff.
who doesn't?
them.
that isn't about your fireflies.
it isn't?
it's about Cherise.
she's the critter, stupid.
I'm a bug?
no, not a bug.
a critter's like... - like what?
like not us.
a critter's like...not a person.
but I'm a person.
Yeah.
look, you don't see horses and chickens playing together, do you?
I like horses and chickens.
but they don't pl together, do they?
that's a hell of a thing to tell a kid.
that's the way the world was.
I was just the messenger.
someone vandalized their house?
that's, uh, the story, anyway.
what, you disputing it, Dale?
all I know...
Mrs. Campbell came into my dad's hardware store asking about paint removers.
to get rid of the graffiti. So what?
so that was two days before her house got vandalized.
are you saying Mrs. Campbell knew it was gonna happen?
I'm saying she wrote those words herself.
Melanie and Cherise were best friends.
that's right.
it concern you at all?
your daughter hanging with a black girl?
no. Why are you asking?
critter lovers. " Remember that?
someone spray-painted those words on our house.
never reported it. Wonder why.
it was nothing, it was just a couple of pranksters.
Co why stir up more trouble?
we know about the visit to the hardware store, Mrs. Campbell.
what are you talking about?
things were heating up.
you wanted to get out of the neighborhood.
get to Genessee creek.
that's why you vandalized your own home.
people were so angry. Hank, all the rest.
I was afraid.
of what they'd do to you.
not me. Melanie.
there was so much hatred. Ugliness.
you wanted to shield her from all that.
so I...told her not to play with Cherise anymore.
that sometimes it's best to stick with your own.
Aw, for god's sake, Frances!
you refused to leave. I didn't have a choice.
they were decent, hard-working people just like us.
I know.
I was just trying to protect my little girl.
I had no idea what damage it would cause.
what happened?
it's nothing.
who hit you? T-tell me.
my dad. Heard about that "critter lover.
said it's my fault all the white people are moving out.
crazy, huh, Mrs. C?
be sure and get an ice pack from the school nurse.
Alvina lights a spark.
Mel, you hear me? Alvina lights a spark.
I'm not playing that anymore. It's little kids' stuff.
you don't wanna see the fireflies?
no.
they're gonna leave, turn to fairies.
fireflies aren't fairies, okay.
but you said...
and horses and chickens don't play together.
you said we'd be friends forever.
no such thing as forever.
that night, my little girl was gone.
I thought our child was in danger.
and she was.
Alvina lights a spark.
that meant Cherise left a note for Melanie.
but the clothesline was down.
so they were leaving them in the storm pipe, right?
the note never turned up.
Oh...that's a reach.
need some leverage.
same basement window the doer used in '75.
lifted a partial palm print off of that ledge.
wasn't a hand print on the ledge.
it was a foot.
neighbor spotted you in the Campbells' yard night Melanie disappeared.
already told you... racist old bat made that up.
got a print off that window ledge.
from a heel.
tell me it's not gonna match yours, Terrell.
I didn't hurt that white girl.
I said...tell me it's not gonna match yours.
you made me a fool.
I defended you to my boss, believed in you.
maybe you shouldn't have.
what were you doing in her yard?
getting the note back for my sister.
then why not say that?
a black boy in a white girl's yard same night she goes missing?
no one's going to believe me.
I would!
you're the police.
I learned 31 years ago what that means.
guilty till proven innocent.
they treated me like I wasn't even human.
times change, Terrell.
not so much.
I just wanted to protect my little sister.
I did what I had to do that night.
go on.
I told Cherise the truth.
heard about what went down at the bus stop today.
sorry.
I left a note for her in the storm pipe.
for Melanie?
maybe she'll find it and want to be friends again?
she's never going to be your friend.
you see, white people, they look at us, and they see ugliness.
they do?
they don't see how pretty you are, or how smart or how cool.
but I do.
and you gotta see that, too.
Melanie thinks I'm cool.
you can't trust 'em. Not even Melanie.
I can't?
Emmett Till learned that the hard way.
who's Emmett Till?
boy who whistled at a white girl.
after, these dudes dragged him out of bed in the middle of the night, shot him.
he wasn't even that much older than you.
now I'm not trying to give you nightmares or nothin', Cherise.
I'm just lookin' out for my little sis.
will you get the note back for me? Please?
sure thing.
now to bed, okay?
yeah?
Asdid Emmett go to heaven?
all kids go to heaven.
I never forgot the look in her eyes when I told her that.
she grew up faster than she should have.
sounds like you both did.
So...you got the note?
it was gone when I got there.
gone? Who took it?
I guess Melanie.
you tell Cherise that?
Yeah.
do you know what the note said?
you gotta make this right, Terrell.
by me.
Cherise ju wanted her friend back.
What'd the note say?
meet me in the woods...tonight.
so Melanie went into the woods that night.
and so did Cherise.
Melanie wasn't abducted from her bedroom.
she went to the woods that night.
the woods?
you asked her to meet you there, Cherise.
in your note.
that's ridiculous.
Alvina lights a spark.
your secret code. Meant you left her a note.
meet me in the woods tonight.
you were waiting for her there.
we were best friends. For forever and a day.
but Melanie didn't believe in forever anymore.
the bus stop. She abandoned you.
quite a betrayal.
it was.
what happened in the woods that night?
I spent my whole life trying to forget.
but you couldn't.
we moved to an all black neighborhood, a world away from Brewery town.
and it just got easier to pretend like it never happened.
what never happened?
I should have listened to Terrell.
black and white, never meant to be.
and I have spent my entire life living like that.
never trusting another white person.
we believed fireflies were fairies and friendships lasted forever.
but we were wrong.
look. Fairies. Last of the season.
thought you didn't believe in fairies.
I'm sorry I was mean to you at the bus stop.
why'd you do that?
my mom said it was better to stick with your own.
Terrell said that, too.
but I don't want to stick with my own.
I want to be with you, Cherise.
me, too, Mel.
you're my best friend.
forever? - And a day.
can't keep away from that critter, can you?
what do you want, Dale?
I drive to this critter's house to scare her, and what do I see?
this one trying to sneak off.
thought you could get away, huh?
I got beat because my dad thinks I spray-painted your house.
did you? - No.
and now the whole neighborhood's gonna move out and he says it's 'cause of me.
he hates me.
you're scaring us.
none of this would've happened if you hadn't moved here.
I wanna go home.
Melanie, run!
I heard the gunshots, and I knew, and I did nothing.
just kept running.
anyone would have.
it's my fault we were in the woods.
it's my fault she died.
you weren't the one with the gun.
every night I would dream about him coming into my room and taking me.
and then the dreams finally stopped.
until now.
the postcard.
just the other night I had a dream.
Melanie was with the fireflies.
in a better place.
heaven.
we got an eyewitness who saw you shoot Melanie.
that's crazy.
is it?
Cherise didn't see me shoot nobody.
never said it was Cherise, Dale.
you sent the postcard.
insurance, to keep Cherise quiet.
your old man beat the crap outta you.
you were lookin' to get even.
you followed cherise into the woods that night, with your father's gun.
I never meant to hurt...
Oh, cut the bull!
you shot at Cherise!
to scare her.
but then...she screamed...
and I thought...I thought I killed her.
and I panicked.
so, you had to kill Melanie, too-- She was a witness.
point of no return.
my dad beat me every night for that critter lover thing.
if he found out about this... he'd kill me.
so I did what I had to do.
what, Dale?
I put her in the car and drove...For hours.
till we got to the west Virginia state line.
then what happened?
then I pulled off the road.
it was dark and there was no one around.
just us.
stop.
right here.
why'd you have to be friends with that critter?
Why?
I just want to go home.
this is all your fault, you hear me.
cause you had to be friends with her.
please.
close your eyes.
I want my mommy.
you can't tell on me.
please.
not anymore.
and then I just...drove away.
no unidentified child murder victims that age in west Virginia, 1975.
doesn't make sense.
rural area.
animals could've carried her off.
or the body was never found.
Interstate files are a joke.
no national database on missing kids back then.
kid crossed state lines, easy to fall through the cracks.
so even if the body was found, no way to connect it to our missing Philly girl.
needle in a haystack.
police report, west Virginia, october '75.
state trooper found a girl just off route 1.
she was shot but alive. Head injury.
no memory of who she was or where she came from.
transported to the county hospital in critical condition.
then put in foster care.
Melanie's still alive?
excuse me?
are you Jennifer Robinson?
Yeah.
Philadelphia pd.
okay.
you were a gunshot victim in '75.
ain't you folks a little late to the party?
hmy you don't remember the shooting?
or where you're from?
couldn't have been good, right?
family was probably the reason I was in those woods.
you're wrong.
your mom and dad never stopped looking for you.
never stopped hoping you'd walk through their door again.
is that right.
their names are Norman and Frances Campbell.
good people.
I don't remember. Sorry.
they never forgot you, Melanie.
is that my name?
and your best friend was a girl named Cherise.
she was with you that night, in the woods.
a lot of people still waitin'... for you to come home.
I should get back to work.
you and Cherise left notes for each other on the...
on the clothesline.
you believed in fireflies and fairies.
please. Stop.
that's why he brought you into the woods.
because you were brave.
in a world that wasn't.
I remember...I wasn't alone. In the woods.
because the fireflies were there...
telling me heaven had to wait.
cause I had to live.
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.
1999/9/13
I like that one, mommy.
you're right, Abby.
it's beautiful.
kind of looks like the old house.
can we just get out of here, mom?
but I think it has a pool, Natalie.
I could have a pool party. For my birthday.
Hello, your birthday is in november.
mom.
just a regular party then.
with a vanilla polar bear cake.
don't hold your breath, Ab.
november's still two months away.
And?
a lot can happen in two months.
we're the Bradford girls. We celebrate birthdays in style.
this year won't be any different.
this our spot, mommy?
Yeah, for tonight.
are we really going to get a house like the one back there?
of course we are, sweetie.
we can have any house we want.
one day.
hmm. Environmental group found it. Testing the bottom of the lake.
for what? - That...stuff they test for.
looks like this heap was submerged for years.
wasn't the only thing submerged.
Marlene Bradford. 35 years old.
how'd you make the ID?
car's vin number. Running dental records for verification now.
she was reported missing eight years ago.
hmm, hot plate.
hmm, tv, hangers.
looks like she was moving. - Or living in her car.
area's popular with the homeless. Has been for years.
a kid's doll.
might have been a whole family.
so what killed her? - Small caliber weapon.
could be a . 38.
that explains Marlene.
so where's the rest of the family?
Marlene Bradford, mother of two.
reported missing november 17, 1999.
kids the last to see?
Yeah, Natalie, 14, Abby, nine.
told the cops mom dropped them off at school. Never came back.
both girls went into the system; We're locating them.
Marlene had a job at al's village market on Broad street.
but she was still living in her car.
you try getting by on six bucks an hour with two kids.
bullet's out to ballistics. Maybe we get a hit.
car doesn't take a dive without making a splash.
thinking some bum in the park saw something?
shelf life's short on the street.
transients disappear.
do a canvas. Maybe we get lucky.
Will...word in my office?
sure thing.
you went behind my back. - Excuse me?
I know you got the name of the ex-trucker Jersey's looking into.
it's a free country. - You need to back off, Will.
he took my wife.
you got no business telling me what to do.
this guy's got it coming, no denying it, but you do this, you're lost.
you know where Mary was going the night she died?
dink's That was our club.
I told her I'd meet her if I got off in time, but...
you worked late.
if I had been there, she wouldn't have been left dying on the side of that road.
it wasn't your fault, Will. - He's got to pay for that.
and he will. Let Jersey bring him in.
what I do with this is my business.
someone shot my mom.
who would do that?
your mom have any enemies?
she was like a pta mom. No way.
but you'd been living on the streets.
for three months, yeah, but it wasn't always like that.
we had a nice house, a yard.
so how'd you end up in the car?
dad got cancer...
and everything changed.
the doctor bills wiped us out.
we lost everything.
your mom have any run-ins on the street?
honestly, I...I don't remember a lot about that time.
you don't remember being homeless?
it sounds weird, but...
what I remember from back then is my mom always being there.
is my mom always being there.
you were young.
maybe your sister Natalie will remember more.
me and Natalie got separated in foster care.
I was lucky. I found a good family right away.
I take it Natalie didn't.
she was older.
no one wanted her for long.
we just kind of grew apart.
and she had changed anyway.
changed how?
she believed mom took off, left us.
but now she'll know it wasn't that way, right?
you didn't believe that?
it was my tenth birthday.
I knew she wouldn't leave us.
someone's going to talk to my sister, right?
Yeah.
tell her I miss her.
OK.
like I said, I don't have a mother.
she jumped ship way back.
we found her this morning at the bottom of Fairmount lake.
she had been shot, Natalie.
she probably did it to herself.
the ultimate escape.
you think your mother killed herself?
my mom was weak and helpless.
she didn't know how to deal with life. - It's a tough thing losing a spouse.
no excuse for being clueless. She didn't even know how to balance a checkbook.
sounds like she got overwhelmed. - And that's my problem how?
any idea who might have had it out for your mother?
be specific, Natalie.
the first night we lost the house, my mom brought us to a shelter in the city.
tough place to end up. - You don't say.
is this where we're going to live now, mommy?
no, baby.
this is only for tonight.
just till I figure things out.
which one is ours?
22
what are you looking at?
I think there must be a mix-up. - There ain't no mix-up.
it's the last bed, and you ain't taking it from me.
but we were guaranteed this bed.
the woman at intake said... - You want this bed, take it.
Barbie here's going to be turning tricks in no time.
don't talk to my daughter like that. - What are you going to do about it?
Hey, what is going on here?
nothing.
I was assigned this bed.
vita. - She don't even need a bed.
you know the rules.
tell her to go sleep in that car I saw her pull up in.
mothers with kids get the last bed.
I see you again, I'll kick your ass, bitch.
we stayed just that one night.
figured we were safer in the car.
maybe Marlene bumped into this Vita outside the shelter?
I already told you what happened.
your mom shot herself.
your sister Abby doesn't think so.
she's young.
she'd like to see you.
she's with a good family now. She doesn't need me.
not going to replace you.
maybe it isn't so bad if they did.
Yeah. I was mad-dogging that woman.
I was mad-dogging that woman.
so what? Did more than that, Vita.
you threatened her. - Not long after, she turned up dead.
those were just words. I barely even remember her.
well, a trip downtown might jog your memory.
I can't be skipping out on my shift.
I'm one paycheck away from being back on the street as it is.
then answer the question. - You ever run into Marlene again?
the truth, Vita.
Yeah, I saw her, okay?
where?
on her way to work at that store over on Broad street.
thought she was a little bitch.
a little bitch, huh?
but homegirl had more heart than I thought.
mommy, where you going?
mommy has to work the late shift tonight.
you're leaving us out here?
I'll be right there.
I can see you through the window.
we're the Bradford girls.
we stick together.
I'm sick of going to school in clothes I slept in.
it's gross.
by the end of the month, we'll have a place of our own, and all this will be a distant memory.
that's what you said last month.
this time it's going to happen.
just stay under the covers, and no one will even know you're here.
no employee parking. Customers only.
I know, Mr. Patel... - Move the car.
what about my kids?
take your kids home to the sitter.
I can't afford a sitter.
you don't like the rules, get another job.
I need this job. Please.
rules are rules.
get them out of here. Now.
well, maybe I'll call the ins.
tell them about the illegals you have cleaning the store at night.
rules are rules.
I'm not moving my car.
you cross me? You'll regret it.
you'll regret it.
Marlene started a war with her boss.
I could have told her.
you can't win a war with management.
now, if you don't mind, I got to get back to work.
Hi. Welcome to blue mart.
that was ballistics.
well, they got a hit on the bullet found in Marlene's car?
from a . 38 colt revolver. - Oh, that's specific.
and guess who owns one?
Marlene's boss.
lost your business, Anil.
for hiring illegals.
common practice.
the big superstores pay a fine.
me? Ruined.
maybe you blamed Marlene Bradford?
maybe it's 'cause of her you got to wear this clown suit.
what are you talking about? Marlene was a good employee.
that superstore was the rat. - Then why'd you shoot her?
she's dead, it was your gun that killed her. You know what?
I'm seeing a new uniform in your future, Anil. Bright orange jumpsuit.
I bought that gun for the store. - And you killed Marlene with it.
no, you don't understand. I gave it to her.
sure you did.
I did.
for her own protection.
mommy, the water's cold.
I know.
I'm sorry, baby.
how come you can't get an office job like Sarah's mom?
cause mom can't find her way out of a paper bag.
not a lot of job openings for housewives with one year of college.
what the hell is going on here?
sorry, Mr. Patel.
the girls needed a place to wash up before school.
look, we're staying across town.
you said no babysitter.
but there's no house, is there?
no one for you to stay with?
no family?
I just need a little more time to scrape up first and last month's rent, and then I'll be able to find a place.
please.
you can use the facility anytime you want, but the parking...
I'm sorry.
if the customers can't park, they find another store, and I'm out of business.
I just don't know where else to go, here it's safe.
Oh, I know a place.
over there at, uh, fairmount park at the, uh, Sweet Briar cutoff.
uh, don't let the looks of me stop you.
it ain't the ritz, but you're not going to be there long anyway.
you're onto sunnier shores real soon.
you're one of the lucky ones. I can tell.
I can tell.
thank you.
here. For you.
you're all alone. To grow old protect yourself.
I can't take that. - You have to.
think about your girls.
everybody needs a helping hand.
land of plenty?
not for people like Marlene.
so who was this homeless dude?
name's Hopper. A regular.
came in for his daily lottery ticket.
you said Fairmount park at Sweet Briar?
definitely.
that's where Marlene's body was found.
well, canvas struck out.
hard to believe anybody would stick around here for eight years.
I thought Will was coming with.
had something to do.
like what? - Wouldn't say.
Vincent Hopper?
Philly P. D.
wanted to talk to you about a woman named Marlene Bradford?
her body was found near here in the lake.
she didn't deserve that.
one in a million, that Marlene. Nicest kids.
you directed her here back in '99.
I thought we'd be celebrating our move to sunnier shores together.
well, looks like she wasn't the only one who didn't make it.
Ah, run of bad luck.
put me behind schedule.
you're lucky I'm still here.
there's a change around the corner, you know?
you know something about Marlene's disappearance?
Marlene wasn't meant for the streets.
last time I saw her, it was only getting worse.
Nat, you're supposed to be in the car with Abby.
I got to use the john if you don't mind.
you couldn't have taken her with you?
jeez, can't I even take a pee without her?
and anyway, she's sound asleep.
Ah, she's just being a teenager.
she's better than most of them around here.
you know everybody here, don't you?
after a few years, it gets easy.
years?
but that's not going to be you.
it's Abby's birthday tomorrow.
I can't even get her a cake.
here.
it's a hope ticket.
a hope ticket?
lets you dream about what you'd do with the winnings.
a million dollars.
deal is, if you win, you got to share the wealth.
50-50.
think of it as a finder's fee.
what would you do with a half a million dollars?
Oh, I'd get my family back.
half a mill?
I could provide for my boy and his mom.
like I should.
how old were you in this picture?
my son's got his eye set on this special glove.
and I mean to get it for him.
then I'm sure you will.
mom! - What's the matter?
－ The car, it's gone. － What?!
Where's Abby? - I don't know, mom!
Where's your sister? - She was in the car!
the car disappeared with Abby in it?
guess she wasn't so lucky after all.
that happened the night before Marlene was murdered.
so, what did Marlene do?
what any mother would do. She panicked.
whoa. Scared the crap out of me, buddy.
just closing up.
you need something?
winter of '95 was really something.
Yeah, it was.
can't get it out of my mind.
Yeah, right. Well, you know, I-I should finish closing.
my wife was killed that night.
hit-and-run trucker.
but you know that, don't you?
no. - She didn't die right away.
Oh, please. - Took a while.
please. I-I...
What-what-what do you...want? Money? A-anything.
what do you think you can possibly give me?
I-I don't know. I...
you left her there to die. - Please. It was an accident.
you drove away.
close your eyes. - No. Please-don't do this.
please. - I said, close your eyes.
no child abduction reports filed the night Marlene's station wagon went missing.
car wasn't even reported stolen.
doesn't make sense. Losing a kid-- parent's worst nightmare.
do almost anything to get them back.
so why not file a report?
maybe Marlene knew who stole it.
or maybe she got spooked. Cops could start asking questions.
like what was Abby doing alone in the car in the first place?
single mother living on the streets. - State could take both girls.
easily.
but her kid's missing. Think it's a chance she'd take.
the car was at a public park. Lot of restrictions.
yeah?
what if it got towed?
her car got towed november '99, by you.
fellas, you know how many cars I tow?
her car had a kid in it. That ring any bells?
according to the records, Marlene racked up over $200 in fines.
and she didn't have that kind of dough.
but somehow she got her wheels back.
like I said, I don't remember.
look, bro...
I've waived a few tickets in my day.
and they weren't nearly as hot as Marlene.
you remember that, uh, red Camaro?
Oh. She stripped a few gears.
I bet you fellas get over a lot, huh?
eh, yeah.
job don't pay nothing, huh? - Gotta make it up somehow.
Yeah, damn right.
that what happened with Marlene?
you cut her a deal?
Yeah, you could say that.
Hey, nothing comes for free, if you know what I mean.
mommy is so sorry, baby.
I promise I'll never leave you like that again.
I knew you'd come get me 'cause tomorrow's my birthday.
it's amazing you'll even be alive to see it.
Natalie... - what?
and she could've been killed, mom. - You don't think I know that?
just go inside, where it's warm, while I go talk to the driver.
all right, it's going to be $279.
I get paid tomorrow. Maybe I could come...
look, save it. You want your ride tonight, lady, you pay for it.
no, you don't understand.
if I don't get this car out of here, my kids don't have anywhere to sleep tonight.
that's not my problem, lady.
look...
I got something in the car.
you could get a lot of cash for it.
like? - A gun.
it's right here.
it was right here! It was right here!
you stole it!
look, you want your ride or not?
I can't leave here without it. My girls...
other ways to settle that tab, lady.
what?
we've got nowhere else to go, please.
mom?
what's taking so long?
just go back inside, baby.
I'll be there in a minute.
Hey, what the he?
her kids were in the next room.
you took the gun, too, didn't you? - That's crazy.
it didn't just walk away, dirtbag.
Hey, it was that girl.
what girl? - The one that was in the car.
look, I saw her take something out of the glove box that night.
Abby took the gun?
time to stop pretending you don't remember, Abby.
I'm not pretending.
certain things you don't forget...
like being in a car that's getting towed.
and taking the gun that killed your mom.
I got scared.
I saw the tow truck driver, and I grabbed it.
what about after?
maybe it went off accidentally.
maybe you got tired of your mother's empty promises.
they weren't empty promises. - You were living in a car, Abby. Come on.
my mom did her best.
everything she did was for us.
only Natalie didn't see it.
promise not to tell mom? - Whatever, stop being a baby.
what are you doing with that? - It was in the glove box.
it's not a toy, Abby!
I wasn't playing with it! I...
there must be, like, 50 cans in there.
we hit the jackpot tonight, girls.
how much will we get for these?
lots.
guess what we're going to do with the money?
something for my birthday?
something special.
like what?
some cake you got out of the garbage?
Natalie, please.
so how did you get the car back?
I sold the gun.
I know what you did.
I'll get us out of this. - How?
by showing us houses we're never going to live in?
we're better off without you and your stupid fantasy world.
stop it, Natalie. - You're disgusting!
I hate you! - You don't mean that.
I wish it was you that died instead of dad.
I'm sorry, baby!
Natalie, come back!
Natalie loved mom. She didn't mean it.
but she left with the gun.
and the next night your mom was dead.
Hey, John.
come on in.
you haven't picked up your phone all day.
all this time he wasn't what I imagined.
what did you do, Will?
I followed him into the alley.
it was dark, raining.
go on.
I put my gun to his chest.
but I couldn't do it.
I wanted him to be a monster.
but he wasn't.
he was just a guy in a diner.
I thought if I could do it...it would make it better.
it won't.
you did the right thing.
that night at Dink's, they were playing Miles Davis, her favorite.
I haven't played one of his records since.
it's been 12 years.
a long time, Will.
Yeah, it feels like yesterday.
she's not coming back, is she, John?
no, she's not.
things got ugly with you and your mom.
I hate you. Wish you were dead.
harsh words.
I was a kid. Kids mouth off.
difference is, you had the gun that killed her.
you got something to say, say it.
at 14, it all seemed so black and white.
life sucks because you have a lousy mother.
what do you know about it?
more than I'd like to.
Yeah, we all got problems, lady.
I'm out of here. - Sit down.
no money. No husband.
no family. Two kids to raise.
your mom deserved better from you.
she filled our heads with empty promises and lies!
she was trying to protect you.
she didn't protect us.
she left us when we needed her the most.
but she came looking for you, didn't she, Natalie?
after you ran off.
Yeah, she found me.
where?
home.
I thought I might find you here.
you have every right to be angry.
but I'm doing my best, Natalie.
why can't you be real for once, mom?
you want to know what's real, Nat?
I never thought I'd be a widow.
I never thought I'd lose our home.
your dad always took care of everything.
all I had to do was love you and your sister.
maybe it's not enough, mom-- love.
it's all I've got.
how could he die on me?
still got each other, mom.
the Bradford girls, remember?
we stick together.
we got to go forward with what we've got.
still got this, too.
a lottery ticket? - It's a hope ticket.
it's worth a try, right?
it's a winner.
25 bucks.
looks like Abby gets her polar bear cake, after all.
and I can still pay the finder's fee.
how about I drive you to school?
and when you and Abby get home, we'll have a real birthday celebration.
we waited for hours after school for her to show.
I was an idiot to believe her.
what about the gun, Natalie?
I gave it back to my mom.
your mom said something about paying a finder's fee?
I don't know what she meant.
means you weren't the last to see her that day.
you lied, Hopper.
me? Lie?
we know Marlene came looking for you, to pay the finder's fee.
was just your luck, that ticket being a winner.
what are the chances, right?
it's news to me. I had no idea.
Oh, I think you did.
so what happened, Hopper? You get greedy?
wanted the 25 bucks all to yourself?
25 bucks? It was a million dollars.
Yeah, right.
a million.
she was lucky.
I know how to pick 'em, always did.
you sure do.
just didn't count on her cheating you like that.
she had no right taking what was mine.
so you took it back-- your share.
damn right. It was my ticket.
was my chance.
to get off the streets?
to get my world back and everything in it..
we won, Hopper! - What?
the lottery ticket.
it's a winner.
Ah, I knew it.
what did I say?!
one in a million, right?!
here.
come look at the birthday cake I got for Abby.
wait, this is $12.
Where's the rest of it?
what do you mean? - The million we won.
million?
hopper, you know how this works.
you're lucky if you win two bucks.
no, I'm going to get my wife back.
I'm going to play baseball with my son.
he wants that special glove, and I'm going to get it for him.
that picture was from a long time ago.
you know that.
no, no.
I promised my boy that glove.
your son's not a kid anymore.
he's a grown man.
he is?
what's past is past.
we got to move on with what we've got.
you're just trying to keep the money for yourself.
no, that's crazy.
now, where is it?!
what are you...what are you doing?!
FAbby's birthday cake!
I know it's here.
you can't take what's mine.
what have you done?
it's my ticket.
hopper, don't.
it's my hope.
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.
2005/5/20
first round's on me, ladies.
I'm all right, Roy. Think I'll get some real food.
Nah, you're coming down to Shiny's.
come on, Mike. You don't like vodka breakfast?
got to work on my boat, fellas. Thing's a frigging master piece by now.
well, I'm taking it to Florida this year.
Yeah. I'll bet you a round he doesn't do it.
double or nothing, next five years, he still doesn't do it.
funny. - Yeah.
um, you guys just, um...
I'll see you.
Hello?!
Hello?!
are you okay?
what's, um...
Hey, what's wrong with her?
Oh, God. She's burning up.
Hey. Hey.
I am taking you out of here.
no. - Yes.
you're sick. I'm taking you.
here we go.
feds have been building a case for years against an Eastern European criminal.
big-time guy, goes by Nachalneek.
Nachalneek? Russian for " boss. "
he's the puppet master of a brutal organization.
they have him? - He's a phantom. Never been ID'd.
what do his puppets do? - Human traffic at the docks.
port of Philadelphia's been ID'das a hub for importing young girls.
forced prostitution.
perfect access for New York, Jersey, DC.
had a female floaterin the Delaware yesterday.
Jane Doe so far. - Think she was trafficked?
dental work's Eastern European. Poor quality, metal fillings.
how she connect to Nachalneek? - Right age, ethnicity.
other signs of his MO.
like? - Cigarette burns.
soles of her feet.
south detectives are working the Jane Doe floater.
where do we come in?
got any cold jobs like her?
solve that, might help the feds' case against Nachalneek.
don't recall any Jane Does like this.
but we had a guy.
polish name.
cigarette burns on his feet. '05 job.
you know him, boss? - Case caught my eye.
he was a longshoreman at the port.
working the docks, he could've crossed paths with Nachalneek.
might be the key to solving this guy's murder.
and catching a ghost.
Mike Chulaski, 35,
longshoreman at Harrison Marine Terminal.
no family. Six days before anyone reported him missing.
guy was invisible. Barely left a footprint.
workers on the docks said he never missed a day.
and this...
was his pride and joy.
nice boat.
wouldn't mind one like it myself.
Mike lived on it. Went missing after he was killed.
I'll start looking for it.
motel he was found in was on the other side of town.
they were working a theory Mike was killed by a pimp.
bludgeoned with a lamp. Lots of prints, no matches.
motel clerk said another guy rented the room. Can't describe him.
no-tell motel for you.
copies of the bills of lading for the boxes that came into the terminal.
boxes? - Containers.
the FBI says the ones with the human cargo arrived when Mike's dock gang was working.
so maybe Mike was in on it? - We can't tell.
but in shipping, nothing happens without the foremanknowing about it.
says here that was Roy Gardecki.
Mike's boss. I'll go talk to him.
know a lot about the port. - I worked on the docks when I was 16.
boxes from your terminal were used to transport young girls, Roy.
fellas, I already talked to the FBI.
not about Mike Chulaski's murder.
could be just what they need to push their case through.
and you get 20 years inside.
the feds don't know what it's like down here.
of course they don't.
they don't know about the low lifes coming around, preying on the working man trying to earn a decent wage.
and you do?
worked here when I was a kid.
things I saw.
then you know it's backbreaking.
it's hard work. Lot of temptation for the easy money.
regular guy like Mike Chulaski gets tempted.
ends up dead, right, Roy?
so you and Mike line your pockets, look the other when those containers came in.
money was good.
Mike never knew about it. - Why not cut him in?
wasn't that kind of guy. He had no idea.
till that morning.
no, it's okay.
what are we gonna do, Roy?
she's so young.
where are her parents? - Alright, easy there.
fifteen.
not so young.
I'm calling the cops. - Mike, think about what you could be getting into here.
phone.
Kiril...
for job.
for me.
no, no, no, no, no. You don't wanta job with that guy.
come here.
look.
you can put her back.
right now. Kiril will kill you if you don't.
let me...go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
you got anybody in America that we cancall right now?
family?
no.
no family, anywhere?
from orphanage.
ukraine.
I don't have family either.
orphan.
me.
what if that was you lying on that couch, huh?
sick kid? - These people are running a business!
she doesn't have any one in the world!
you know what that feels like?
no one to look out for you.
I do.
you're gonna keep her?
it's crazy.
I'm not putting her in that van, Roy.
and if you tell meto do it one more time...
well, maybe...
you and me...
we'll go to the cops together.
who was this Kiril she wanted to reach?
American. Transported the girls.
middleman.
got a number for him? - Look, I told you what I know.
meet you back at the car, Nick.
I know the waterfront, Roy.
Mike stood up against the low lifes.
it got him crushed.
you looked the other way.
now's your chance to make it right.
I'm not asking.
give me a number for Kiril.
never had one.
runner dropped a message, which box to set aside, he'd show up to unload.
that's it.
any idea who he was working for?
called him Nachalneek.
Kiril was terrified of the guy.
What'd Mike do with Lena? - Took her to his boat.
said he was gonna help her. - He say how?
try and get her a visa, take her to some community center for advice where people would know about that stuff.
we don't deal with illegals.
must get a few in here.
I mainly deal with exchange students who want to stay.
occasionally, these girls show up.
girls like Lena?
they lie about how they got here, but...
we all know.
out of the containers.
any of the girls mention the name Nachalneek?
no.
they never give any details.
I do what I can for them, but...
they're not supposed to be here.
you try helping Lena? - Can't help someone who doesn't want it.
I have no money, Mike.
this lady helps you for free.
in America people do stuff'cause they're kind, you know?
not 'cause they want something from you.
you okay?
she doesn't qualify for the T1 visa.
why not?
she wasn't prostituted, was she? No, course not.
then technically, she's here illegally.
that's how the embassy will see it, and they willdeport her.
that doesn't make sense. - Back to Ukraine?
No!
Lena. Don't go.
you don't understand what could happen to you.
can't go back.
no money. No family. Nothing there.
you got someone who cares about you now.
you don't have to go it alone anymore.
I'm hungry. Can I have candy bar?
why don't you eat a real meal? Get your strength up.
better than nothing, I guess.
I got some change.
machine's that way.
growing upon your own...
it's hard.
people treat you like a punching bag.
I don't want that to happen to her. Knocks the life out of you.
there's not much you can do for her, I'm afraid.
I can look out for her, you know?
like family.
young girl.
can be difficult.
she makes a phone call and she's gone.
I wish I could've helped more, but there's a new one every day.
think of anything else, you can reach us here.
there's only one person Lena wanted to call.
so she goes to meet him? - And Mike knows it. Tracks them down.
gets himself killed, playing hero.
what do you got?
I...need some lost hours.
I didn't know who else to call since the husband took off.
I last saw her a week ago.
she won't answer the door.
okay.
she's always saying how her daughter's got a good job.
smart girl.
is she?
so, I thought maybe you cod take care of the rent.
due three weeks ago. - Yeah, sure.
you said it's been a week?
Yeah.
mom? - She all right?
mom?
no.
call 911.
you said you'd clean up this time.
nice job. Ending up in the ER.
I gotta go home.
you're not going anywhere.
I'm going home, Lilly... Oh.
doctor said you can't drink again.
help me out here, will ya?
Where's my coat?
you have late-stagecirrhosis.
you're getting admitted.
you can't...
have another drink again.
not one.
I'm fine, Lilly.
Yeah, you look great, Mom.
what do you want from me?
you'll have to come stay with me.
I thought you were"getting too old for this. "
I said that when I still had a choice.
Kiril's in custody. Tracked him to a pay-as-you-go cell.
Kiril faces federal trafficking charges.
any deal's possible if he points to Nachalneek.
even if he killed Mike Chulaski? - Any deal. US Attorney's gunning for Nachalneek.
it's all aboutthe big fish, huh? Never mind a poor working guy getting offed.
Nachalneek's the prize.
Prize...is locking up Mike's doer for life.
not for the feds. Yeah, we'll help them get their phantom.
good.
ain't gonna cut a deal with a murderer, though.
don't go cowboy on us, okay?
what the hell does that mean?
the Burrell job, Scotty.
vigilante dad?
you screwed up.
don't screw this up.
I put dirt bags away. You do the paperwork.
can't handle a strong woman, can you?
no, maybe I just don't like you.
broken wing's more your type.
you don't know me. - Yeah. I do.
can't stand it, huh? - Stand what?
that I can handle you.
so, how'd it go, Kiril? Mike steals away one of your girls, so you have him killed?
my girls?
I'd love to help you gents, but you got the wrong guy.
cut the BS.
a witness saw you loading those girls into a van.
Oh, look, I was just a driver.
picked up the girls, TVs, whatever needed delivering.
you work for Nachalneek?
Nah, just, just heard the name.
but friendly advice.
you might as well stop looking. Why's that?
you talk about Nachalneek, you disappear.
so where'd you take the girls and the TVs?
that's where my memory fails me.
sorry, gents.
lay of the land, Kiril.
you're looking at 20 in federal prison.
for what?
trafficking.
witness, remember?
unless you prefer a murder charge for Mike Chulaski.
I never killed nobody.
help us with Mike's murder, do a reduced sentence.
so where'd you take Lena?
some...
crap building.
12 Pearl Street. - What went on there?
dump full of underage tail?
what do you think?
and Mike? - Oh, Mike was a dumbassof epic proportion.
he find you on the docks after Lena disappeared on him?
Yeah. Wanted something wasn't his property.
excuse me.
what? - Excuse me. Can you, uh...
I gotta talk to you. Can you...?
what? - Where's Lena?
curly hair. Yea high.
she's one of your girls.
Oh.
you're a rube. You're way out of your depth.
better walk away. - I want her.
what's that? - I want her!
you think you can get your rocks off for free?
Hey, wake up. It's America. Nothing's for free.
she's a kid. It's not like that.
you're begging for this girl, and you say it ain't for sex?
so what, you wanna watch TV together?
admit it.
all right!
all right what?
I want to...
bang her.
you were right.
just...
tell me where I can do that.
12 Pearl Street.
knock yourself out.
guy was just a horny perv like all the rest.
that's all I know.
so...
I'm done, right?
sit your ass down.
your next stop'sthe federal pen.
12 Pearl Street's abandoned. Previous tenantsall fake names. Dead end.
so, Kiril played us? - Not quite.
found a 911 call for an overdose to that address two years back.
gave the girl's real name.
Accurint's got an address for her in Long Island. Town called Bellport.
if Kateryna workedat Pearl Street, maybe she knew Lena.
and saw Mike when he came looking for her.
didn't think you were coming in.
me neither.
we've got everything covered if you gotta be somewhere else.
I'd rather be here than where I was.
fair enough.
you have an appointment? - Kateryna Yevchenko?
detectives Valens and Miller, from Philadelphia.
we're lookinginto a homicide. Mike Chulaski.
ring a bell?
he came to Pearl Street looking for a girl named Lena.
long time ago.
I don't remember.
that why you OD'd?
what went on in that place, Kateryna?
bad as you imagine.
worse.
we were slaves.
how'd you get out?
after I am too old for Pearl Street,
I go on my own.
I am good, so I get nest egg.
what about this guy Mike?
I take money from Mike to bring him to Lena.
she wasn't with the others?
in different room because she resisted.
another $50.
Lena. Oh, God.
they lied about job, Mike. - I know.
they lied. - I'm gonna get you out.
they won't let you. They will kill her.
what's wrong? - My feet.
cigarette burns. She can't walk.
you get her hopes up, you make it worse for her. You cannot save her.
I'm not leaving you here Lena. - I can't walk, Mike.
Nachalneek's coming.
listen, this necklace, you see this?
it's St. Nicholas. He'll keep you safe until I came back.
I've seen you before.
you should know better, Katya.
get him out. - Mike, no, don't leave me here.
Mike, don't leave me here.
don't leave me. Don't leave me here!
don't leave me here! - I'll come back for you, I promise!
come back and you're dead.
Nachalneek was Boyka?
I will never testify against her.
that was her thing? The burning?
what she did to us.
punishment.
so Mike promises he's going back for Lena...
winds up Boyka cigarette on him.
so you're the famous Nachalneek.
lot of people looking for you.
Nachalneek just means boss.
could be anyone.
there's a witness.
this person wants to testify?
the FBI is charging you with violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.
and this person wants to testify?
that's their issue. We have you for murder.
I don't know who that is.
you met him when he came looking for Lena, one of your girls.
winds up dead with your trademark cigarette burns on him.
someone has framed me.
you got to do better than that, boss.
I'm happy to.
honesty is the best policy.
let me in!
I'm not leaving!
you are risking your life for nothing.
what do you want for her, money?
I need a young one.
take Kateryna instead.
blonde, beautiful, doesn't complain.
I want Lena.
everybody left her, but not me.
I won't. - You can't afford Lena.
I'll give you $50, 000.
you have this kind of money? - I'll get it.
she has potential, but...
she's difficult.
get the money, you can have her.
Kiril will contact you.
so Mike and Kiril met up? - Starlight Motel.
Kiril went for my money, but I never saw it or Lenaor Kiril again.
you're locked up, Boyka. - On what charge?
prostitution and conspiracy.
I'll be in jail one night.
don't fool yourselves.
but thank you for finding him.
Kiril.
he's in custody. You can't touch him.
Oh, no?
you got stones, Kiril.
turned on Nachalneek.
pocketed Mike's money, killed him at the motel swap.
who told you that?
Nachalneek herself.
aka Boyka.
she know I talked to you? - Yeah.
you two got a lot to sort out. - Maybe they should talk face-to-face.
you got to get me out of general population.
you want that, you better start singing.
for starters, how is it you're in a motel room with Mike, and he ends up with his head bashed in?
okay, I'll tell you.
just protect me from her.
listening.
I got two rooms at this motel in Point Breeze.
why two?
I met Mike in one; Lena's in the other.
the plan was, when I got the cash,
I'd call Lena, bring her to him.
that was pretty cloak-and-dagger. - Was Boyka's idea.
that way, Mike would never know where Lena was, if he got stupid.
Mike bring the money? - No. The dumb ass got stupid again.
50000
I got eight grand here. And I got the rest coming from a loan.
I'll give the rest as well.
deal's off.
I got a bo.
it's a beauty.
perfect, actually.
I don't need a boat. - You'll make money on this.
you could sell it, get $70, 000 in a heartbeat.
70? How do you figure?
I spent the last ten years of my life fixing it up.
I mean it. It's a prize.
that's coming from you, though.
you're a capital "T" tool.
go look at it. Tacony Marina, slip 220.
keys. - I'm not giving them up without Lena.
forget it, then.
you take the boat.
I take her.
she's my family now.
your boyfriend's acting like a dumb ass, as per usual.
so sit pretty. I'll be back in an hour.
stay put.
Mike was still alive when you left?
Yeah.
watching me from the door, that idiot. - Yeah.
and when you got back?
head's smashed in, boat keys missing.
Lena still in the other room? - You think I stuck around to find out?
I screwed up a job for Boyka. That's the end of the road.
fine. Thanks - I got lost.
Miller found Mike's boat.
the marina up in Connecticut.
find an owner? - Guy says he bought it in cash here in Philly from a young girl, - foreign accent. - Lena.
kid didn't have a heart of gold after all.
guard.
Kiril give this up? - New house run by Boyka.
thinking one of these girls knows where Lena ran?
locked in a house together. Must've shared something.
don't really want to see this.
I'm not Lena.
Lena, we found Mike's boat.
stop calling me that. It's not my name.
you want to forget who you used to be?
when you first came here, met Mike.
he saved you.
I know you remember.
cause you kept his necklace.
that thing.
I don't know what it is. - You remember, Lena.
how Mike told you'd always be safe with this necklace, and how you betrayed him.
me betray him?
I did not! - You took his money, and you left him to die.
he is dead?
he was murdered.
Mike said...
in America, people do things to be kind.
but they don't.
Mike didn't want anything from you.
that's right.
not from me.
his house is a boat.
I make you look nice. Sit still.
and he says that you never are dizzy after you live there for a few days.
and he say I can go to school for free, no problem.
I don't want you to get your hopes up, little duck.
but Mike promised me.
how many time I've seen people in this country tell lies.
not Mike.
he is different from everybody.
your boyfriend's acting like a dumbass, as per usual.
so sit pretty. I'll be back in an hour.
it is Mike?
I am so sorry.
what? - It is good you did not hope too much.
what did he say?
Mike wants a girlfriend.
for sex.
he asked for me, the pretty one.
my poor little duck.
he said he would come for me.
he wants me now.
stay here.
someone will come for you.
I gave up hope like she said.
doesn't hurt anymore.
wait. He came for you.
not Kateryna.
she lied, not Mike.
no.
they all lie.
he gave up his boat to get you from Nachalneek.
his boat is... is where he live.
and he was willing to give it up.
for me?
he was killed trying to save you.
he said...
that you were his family.
get what you wanted, Kateryna?
I earn it all.
I work very hard to get what I deserve.
the American dream.
now I can be new person, hold my head up.
every dream takes sacrifice.
what was yours?
I sold my body.
does things to you. Makes you desperate.
you were at the motel. Went to Mike's room, night he died.
you lied to Lena. Said Mike didn't want to save her.
he didn't. He was like all the others.
like the other men who hurt you?
why'd you take away her chance to have a decent life?
I was dying in that house, too.
so you killed a man.
finally get something for yourself.
you don't understand what it was like.
how could you?!
ten men a day?
spitting on you, ripping you apart.
when I first got there,
I resisted, too
I used to believe someone would come and take me away.
but no one came.
Mike did.
not for me.
you've seen Lena?
where has Kiril gone?
uh, to see my boat.
I'm giving it to him for Lena.
Where's Lena? Is she okay? - She is not here.
now relax, Daddy.
Yes, yes.
did something happen to her?
okay. Get off me!
choose me instead. I am much better.
you want me to be sister, daughter?
please. I will. - What are you doing?
don't make me go back to that house.
Mike, you are a nice man.
I give you anything.
I just want Lena. That's all.
no, no. Help me.
I'll help you once I've got her, okay?
please. - Can't let her down.
I'm all she has.
I want somebody to care for me so I am not alone.
I'm sorry.
I got to find Lena.
what about me?
I got to go. I'm sorry.
what about me?!
what about me?!
???
??
the daughter survived a bullet to the head.
I remember.
who is he? You're not gonna take her from me???
Hey! I'll kill all of you.
Hey!
you're coming, too.
Rush: I'm going.
you' die.
shoot me! Do it now!
the following story is fictional and does notdepict any actual person or event
pop says we're not supposed to go past Mrs. Mortenson's house.
who cares what your pop says?
no, serious. He'll blow a gasket if we go to the pool again.
so what are we gonna do?
hang out here in Snoozerville?
he said a kid just got beat up really bad in Fishtown.
Jackie's gonngo wee-wee in his diaper.
scaredy cat. Shut up, man. I ain't scared.
so what are you waiting for, wusses?
all right. To the pool.
Fishtown teenagers Dylan Noakes and Teddy Nimmo were convicted today in the brutal deaths of three local fifth-grade boys.
Nimmo was the only one to confess to the crime, calling it a "thrill kill.
look who bothered coming to work.
Hey. Hey.
hey...
you okay?
Oh, yeah, they... they just took the stitches out. Ah.
it's nothing. I'm fine.
you look good, Lil. You do.
the city's going all-out, huh? Yeah.
take a bullet, think they'd give you more than a Mickey Mouse band-aid.
didn't stop them from siccing IAD on our asses.
JEFFRIES: Protocol -- said he's got to dot the "I's,
prove it was a good shooting.
so, uh, you ready to jump back in the saddle here or what?
VERA: ?? Nervous Nellies.
need a refill.
second that.
uh, get you anything, Lil?
no, no, I'm good. Thanks.
woman: Are you detectives?
you need something?
you people killed my son.
welcome back, Lil.
I heard about that job.
your son and his buddy did a triple back in '93, '94.
VALENS: We put him away, lady, we didn't kill him.
might as well have.
Teddy hung himself.
they gave me his stuff from the cell.
I found this letter.
I tape their eyes shut "so they stay in e dark forever.
just like me.
stop me. I am the monster.
must have been the real killer that sent him that letter when they first locked him up.
should've given it to his lawyer.
yeah? Teddy tried.
again and again.
I just talked to that jackass.
he never listened.
maybe 'cause your son write it. Ain't possible.
believe me.
we're not gonna just take your word.
my boy, uh, he couldn't write.
he could barely read.
they said he was a monster because was used to smile at the trial.
that's what Teddy does when he's scared.
he smiles.
my son, he woul't hurt a soul.
we'll look into it, Mrs. Nimmo.
no, you won't.
we're just Fishtown trash, right?
people like us...
we don't matter.
???
cops never released that detail to the public, doer taping the dead kids' eyes shut.
well, he had an accomplice, right?
maybe that guy wrote it.
well, then who mailed it?
postmark's from Philly.
his buddy's doing life up in Graterford.
could be worth another look.
could be a wild-goose chase.
and it closed.
well, if the killer's still out there...
it's not.
VALENS: The victims were last seen on their bikes outside the Raymes residence.
bodies found a day later.
RU: Ran into the doers at the abandoned pool.
Dylan and Teddy's "hangout.
our cause of death, blunt force trauma.
multiple blows to the skull, the face.
murder weapon never found.
criminal psychologist said the scene "reflected the frenzied, explosive rage of a severely disturbed and abused child.
or two of them.
Teddy, raised by a crackhead single mom.
Dylan, bumped around the foster care system since age five.
history of abuse, petty crime, setting fires.
on the stand, Dylan called himself a "nihilist.
no beliefs, no loyalties, no purpose in life but destruction.
I didn't know you worked this job.
no, I didn't.
this kind of massacre, everyone knew about it, wanted answers, blood.
glad to have you back.
good to be back, boss.
start counseling yet?
not yet. I... will.
was the assigned back in '94.
thinking we'd have a talk with Dylan, too.
Teddy confessed.
witness at the boys' school overheard them bragging about the murders, what's there to talk about?
the letter, who sent it?
question Documents has it.
maybe they give us some answers.
Joe Connelly was a good cop.
job's closed.
you got any open jobs for me, boss?
counseling's not optional here, Rush.
get that done first.
Yeah.
I will.
gotta put in my shrink hours after that shooting.
make sure I'm not nuts.
gotta be to come back to this job.
you know, I, um,
I never got to say, uh, thanks.
for what you did.
I told that Iad jerk what a hero you were.
as long as you don't make me do it again.
okay.
take a ride up to Graterford?
wasting our time.
got nothing but, right?
so you coming?
found this in your, uh, buddy's belongings, Dylan.
nice try.
I didn't write that drivel.
barely looked at it.
would you prefer a handwriting sample?
save us all this face-to-face?
heard about what happened to Teddy yet?
Oh, shocking people... that get you off?
you sure you want to know what gets me off, lady?
we're out. Forget this ass clown.
locked in a dark room for hours, your letter writer.
little boy blue.
boo-hoo.
you ever locked in a dark room, Dylan?
I am now. All those halfway homes, mean foster mommies.
you must hate the world.
killing those boys your payback?
sure.
I'm the fire-breathing dragon from Happily Ever After Land.
nice tat.
I just got it.
you want one?
you didn't answer the question.
you'll believe what you want.
the truth's irrelevant.
truth being you're a murdering son of a bitch.
truth being we were 17 and stupid.
we still believed.
believed what? That they wouldn't put you away for a crime you didn't commit.
here they come. Here they are.
how could they give us life, Dyl?
we didn't do anything.
Where's my mom?
mom?
mom?
man: You let my son die!
I hope they kill you in prison! Jack!
woman: I want my son back!
let's give them what they want then.
land of the free, home of the brave.
guilty for... being a freak.
welcome to the U. S. of A.
you're breaking me up here, homes.
stay a little longer, guapo.
I'll break you in for real.
you promise?
I'm done here.
attitude like that helped put you here in the first place.
being poor is what put us away.
not to mention your buddy's confession.
he was a kid, okay? Mama's boy.
no match for that cop.
you saying Connelly forced Teddy to lie?
cop forcing a false confesssion?
no... that never happens.
man: That letter is pure B. S.
Dylan's a con artist.
primo sociopath.
got a IQ of 190.
he's playing you.
JEFFRIES: Well, maybe he is.
just doing due diligence, Joe.
you saying I blew the job?
I'm just saying I'm doing mine.
connelly: Takes a while, beating a person to death.
VERA: The kind of job that gets to you.
cost me my marriage.
I hear that.
we searched all night, and then I found them.
it rained the night before they were killed.
?? Pool stuck with mud...
think of anything else, you know where to find us.
appreciate your time, Joe.
the night I go to arrest that punk, Dylan, you know what he says?
what's that?
think I'll be on the news tonight?
now you tell me they didn't do it.
the guy did his job.
what the hell are we doing?
Rush: Dylan's handwriting wasn't a match to the letter.
ain't what you call exact science.
could have faked it.
could've got some prison groupie to write it.
the kid's a genius, right?
no forensics connecting him to that kind of crime scene?
come on. And what happened to the murder weapon?
they dumped it.
bodies were left where they're sure to be found, sure to be connected to Dylan and Teddy, so why hide the weapon?
you're reaching, Lil.
and you're reaching for my Kung Pao chicken.
it's family style. So what?
do I look like your family?
Connelly said there was a storm the night before the murders.
mud all over the scene, right?
VERA: Yeah, so what?
and the kids supposedly rode their bikes to the pool.
so why no mud in their wheels?
miller: Squeaky clean, every one of them.
when Connelly was tracking mud all over the damn place.
pool wasn't the death scene, just the dump site.
somebody carried the boys the, and their bikes.
??
thought I told you this job was closed.
Rush: Well, the kids weren't murdered at the pool.
so?
how'd Dylan and Teddy tranort the bodies?
didn't own a car, didn't even have licenses.
they could've stolen a car to get them.
no vehicle thefts reported in the vicinity of the pool.
well, could've carried them there at night.
no one would have seen them.
okay, sure, so why go to all that trouble of putting bodie in the one spot connected to you?
you're saying the dump site was a setup?
well, bodies were supposed to be found, pinned on the bad kids who hung there 24/7.
so where were they killed?
that's what we got to find out.
you talk to any of the parents yet?
probably knew their kids' haunts.
Sean's folks left the state years ago.
moved to Oregon.
we reached out to George's family.
got shut down.
that's understandable.
job's closed.
why dig up the worst memory of your life?
Jack's parents are still in Fairmont.
his mom was the last to see.
Jeffries and Miller are having a talk.
all right, Scotty, you're the assigned on this one.
Yeah, sure.
you put those monsters away and you want to let them go.
that's not what we're doing, Mr. Raymes.
we wanted to ask about some other places
Jack and his friends might have played.
Why?
we think your son and his friends were killed elsewhere, moved to the pool.
moved?
Oh, my God.
is this really necessary?
we just barely got our lives back together.
I'm not really sure that my wife can go through this again.
I've noticed a lot of empty factories in the neighborhood.
did any of the boys play there?
no. I told Jack to stay away from those places.
boys will be boys.
not Jack, he was a good kid.
he always minded his mom and me, and he would never've done anything without telling us.
got anything to add, Mrs. Raymes?
I should have stopped him from going?
JEFFRIES: Going where?
off the block that day.
Jack: To the pool!
Jack, where do you think you're going?
nowhere.
get over here, mister.
I'm working the late shift tonight, so the last thing I need is you running all over town.
Oh, Jack, not again with the wipeouts.
taking that bike away if you can't be more careful.
I am careful, Mom.
you've been to that pool again, haven't you?
we can do wheelies and cool stuff there.
and Sean and George will go home if we have to say in Snoozerville.
and I'll be all alone!
look, you can go past Mrs. Mortensen's if you promise to stay away from the pool.
really, Mom? Go on, get out of here before I change my mind.
you might want to zip up your backpack before your buddies see Lil' Duke.
why are you carrying him around anyway?
cause Lil' Duke keeps the dragon away.
the dragon?
I thought he'd be safe.
I never should have let him off the block.
Jack mentioned something about a dragon?
I didn't think anything of it.
kids' imaginations and all.
Jack had that stuffed imal the day he died?
police said they never found it.
maybe you will? It was his favorite toy when he was a little kid.
he slept with it curled up in a little ball.
he said it, uh, "kept the monsters away.
I mean, not that he'd ever admit it.
he was just a little boy, okay?
he was the victim.
not them.
the dragon.
those boys were scared of you.
do you mind?
this ball and chain kind of makes it hard to converse.
you push them off their bikes at the pool?
bruise them?
I scared them.
I never touched them.
never came up in the first investigation, you bullying them. If I had told, it'd give
Connelly more rope to hang me with.
you know that ??? stuffed toy after you killed him, Dylan?
?? Three little boys died.
someone's got to pay.
like the trash from the wrong side of the tracks.
so, the whole neighborhood lies?
just the ones that matter.
the cop, the wannabe cheerleader.
the star witness who heard you take credit for the murders?
come on.
Oh, u mean the attention whore?
year before the trial, she's running around school saying that she's got terminal cancer, right?
and your lawyer never brought this up?
I guess it slipped his mind.
cause you're nothing but trash.
did you kill those boys, Dylan?
evil Triumphs.
you wrote that.
when good men do nothing.
that's the quote.
evil triumphs when good men do nothing.
Edmund Burke.
guess you're not familiar.
we'll check out that witness.
but if this is some kind of con...
spent half my life in here.
I'm probably gonna die in here, too.
I'm all out of cons.
I didn't kill those boys.
in court, you testified Dylan said, quote, "We killed those brats, bashed their heads in. It was fun
that was a long time ago.
why does it matter now
he said you made it up.
and you believe that weirdo?
I found this in the court records, too.
restraining order you filed against your homeroom teacher.
claimed he was stalking you.
what is this? Stalking, cancer...I mean, help me out here, Heidi, 'cause from where I'm sitting you got a real problem with fact and fiction.
everyone said they did it, even our pncipal.
Oh, so they must've, right?
Dylan and Teddy poured pig's blood in assembly to protest the Rwandan genocide or whatever it was called, okay?
they were freaks.
guess what I heard?
when they found those little boys, their heads were like smushed pumpkins.
Oh, my God, freak alert, 12: 00.
I thought you'd be dead from cancer by now, Heidi.
um, do I even know you?
from second grade, remember?
I popped you under the jungle gym.
I bet you killed those kids.
maybe we bash your head in, bitch.
so, Dylan never actually said, "We killed those brats, bashed their heads in"?
Teddy confessed to that cop, right?
what else do you want?
homegirl basically made it up.
no one questioned her story.
someone had to pay.
why not the Fishtown freaks?
house of cards coming down.
we go back to Connelly? And say what
that your case sucked?
how about "it's looking like a cover-up"?
checked out abandoned factories in Fairmont.
complaint came in the night of the murders.
six-foot-five homeless man,
Caucasian, spotted in empty lot at the corner of Fifth and Allen.
that's five blocks from the pool.
and get this:
the guy was agitated, freaked out, and covered in blood.
unis pick him up?
no, complaint gets lost in the system.
by the time it surfaces the next morning, our homeless man's long gone.
unbelievable. Gets better.
questioned Documents found what looks like a partial number in the upp right hand corner.
same kind of number evidence control uses in our investigations.
you're saying the letter was mailed to Teddy from inside homicide?
????
Vera's canvassing shelters, soup kitchens in the area for a six-foot-five male.
needle in a haystack.
worth checking with the cops on homeless shuttle, see if they picked up any Jolly Green Giants on their sweeps.
what about the letter?
well, evidence custodian back in '94 was a uni name of Jade Diaz.
only one who could've signed it out.
funny thing is, she transferred out of evidence control two weeks before the trial.
you having a talk?
Miller is.
you realize this is a cop's career?
a cover-up, too.
maybe.
that's a big maybe.
step lightly.
always do, boss.
you don't think she's ready to be back.
doer had to write it.
public never knew he taped up their eyes.
seen lots of evidence over the years.
I don't recall that letter.
sorry.
Oh.
well, according to your log, letter came in after Teddy's confession.
Connelly must've seen it.
but he had his doers, so he buries it.
I'm due at roll call in 20. Want to speed this up?
but you know the letter exists and you got access.
so you mailed it to Teddy.
you like being a cop?
the job?
Yeah.
me, too.
Teddy hung himself.
two days ago.
Oh... I thought you knew.
just turned 30 years old.
what a waste.
wonder how he felt... when he got that letter?
knowing you believed in him.
only one in the world who did.
Connelly interviewed the kid.
twelve hours
had me set up the tape for the confession.
tape?
there was never a taped confession at the trial.
you don't say.
we know about the tape, Connelly.
one that never made it to court.
don't you have open jobs to work?
bad guys to catch?
six-foot-five homeless guy, bloody, agitated, five blocks from the pool.
he bad enough for you?
you saying I'm out of line?
pot calling the kettle black, bro.
excuse me?
IAD's got it hard for you, and everyone knows it.
that was a good shooting... bro.
someone's gonna take a fall.
and from what I hear...
you're their butt boy.
Oh, yeah? l right, talk about the tape.
you got no idea the kind of pressure we were under.
kid killers out there... must've been tough.
they did it, but the little bastards won't own up.
so what do you do? Let them walk?
Rush: Not a chance.
so you brought in Teddy, the weak one.
crying about how he's innocent, how he wants his rights.
where were those dead kids' rights when they were being aten to death?
they didn't have any rights.
I already told you, we didn't do nothing.
you saw those kids at the pool, though, didn't you?
no. Not that day, we didn't.
and you got mad at them 'cause they called you freaks, weirdoes.
didn't they? No. Just you do that.
you hit them over and over till they stopped moving.
just say it, and you can go home.
and this nightmare is over.
don't you want to go home, Teddy?
: Yeah.
then just say it.
we saw them at the pool.
then what happened?
we stabbed them.
you hit them, you mean, right?
thrill kill.
yeah... okay.
we hit them.
over and over until they stopped moving.
I want my mom.
I want to go home.
you got no right to judge me.
those boys did it.
you sure about that... Connelly?
Absolutely.
then why'd you bury the tape?
VERA: My snitch swears he saw Big Foot here a couple hours ago.
your snitch's a money-grubbing pain in the ass.
yo! You seen a six-foot-five homeless guy here, mamacitas?
I can just take you in for loitering.
been to every shelter, soup kitchen in the city.
we're not gonna find him.
well, it's time to shut down Hooker Mart.
no pay or play till you give me Sasquatch, ladies.
JEFFRIES: It's a fool's errand.
they're not gonna talk to you.
look...
you fly, I'll buy.
get me a couple of cold ones.
you want to find someone?
all you had to do was ask the right way, big boy.
Where'd you get the dog, big man?
we found it in your cart.
from the Devil.
you mean from the little boy, in the pool.
how'd you know about that?
cause he's God, jackass.
that's right.
I see everything.
I saw what you did to those little boys.
I didn't mean to. Prove it.
tell me what happened.
it was him...
the Devil.
he made me do it.
all the evil in the world in those eyes.
he ran...
he dropped it.
I took it... to show the world...
what he did to those children.
looks like we got played.
by the Devil himself.
put his cuffs on.
Dylan: What? Do it.
you're pretty good.
you had me going there. This how you get your kicks?
Hey, I didn't lie to you...
you were at the pool, standing over the bodies.
we got a witness.
you wouldn't understand.
you're right. I got no idea what it's like to look into three little kids' eyes and beat them to death.
Yeah, well, neither do I...
you were standing over their bodies!
you were holding Jack's bloody toy in your hand!
you want to believe I did it?! Then fine!
okay, I did it! I killed them!
you're a monster...
you've got no idea what that means.
why'd you tape their eyes shut?
I thought I knew how cruel and ugly the world was.
I was wrong.
they were just kids.
you know?
we all were.
um...
sometimes I dream that, um...
they're still alive.
and we all get to start over again.
you saw Jack curled up with that stuffed dog?
are you sure?
like he was asleep.
it was keeping him safe.
stooping pretty low bringing me in like this.
well, found your son's stuffed dog, Henry.
lil' Duke.
it was left with him.
your son was, uh, afraid at nights.
and your wife worked the graveyard shift.
what's your point?
leaving him home alone with you.
night he died.
you people are unbelievable.
those bruises Jack had.
Dylan didn't give them to him, did he?
I loved him.
ask anyone -- ask my wife.
she's here.
look...
you got the animals who murdered my child.
now, why don't you just leave well enough alone?
doesn't work like that.
Hey, got to step out.
why are you doing this to us?
I think you know why, Tanya.
we lost our son.
we're the victims here.
you have no right.
what's it like?
cooking his meals, sleeping in the same bed, making love...
with the man who killed your child?
how dare you?
my husband is a good man, decent, kind.
it's so much easier to believe monsters do these things...
not men.
I don't have to listen to this garbage.
we found Jack's stuffed imal.
lil' Duke.
it was in the pool.
he was holding it, just like he did at night when he was sleeping.
I... I don't understand.
whoever hurt him loved him, too.
I have to find my husband.
if Jack was alive today... he'd be 24.
a man.
able to protect himself.
but he couldn't back then.
he was just a little boy.
please, stop this.
but you can protect him, Tanya.
you can help him now.
What'd you see, Tanya?
: I don't know what I saw.
you tried to forget, but you can't.
it was the day we buried our son...
that I saw...
honey.
you found that.
I've been looking everywhere for that thing.
you must have dropped it.
I miss him, honey.
I miss him, too.
he has flashlights in every room, you see.
Why?
Henry's always been terrified of the dark.
he sleeps with the lights on.
STILLMAN: You wanted to get caught.
you were screaming to get caught.
but no one listened.
they already had Dylan and Teddy, the perfect scapegoats.
but what gets you in the end is the people you love.
like what happened to you as a boy.
I'm not following.
who locked you in a...
dark room, Henry?
your wife isn't protecting you anymore.
enough with the act.
I want a lawyer.
I'm not talking to you.
fine.
maybe you should spend some time alone then.
in the dark.
no.
if you lock me in here, I'll kill you!
I will kill you!
you hear me?!
sit down, Henry.
sit down.
don't leave me in here.
please, don't leave me in here.
STILLMAN: You promised yourself you would never let it happen again.
no one would ever put you in the dark.
or they would pay.
and that's why you taped their eyes shut.
make them pay forever.
he was...
he was a bad boy, that Jack.
Sneakly go
so many...
so many dirty things in the dark... waiting for you.
I told him to play inside with the others.
where it was safe.
: nowhere is safe.
it's darkness everywhere.
inside the house, inside the basement.
inside, inside of me.
how many times I got to tell you to put those damn bikes away?
hi: Don't.
no.
please, Daddy.
don't leave me.
no, not the dark!
please. Don't!
he needs some help.
: daddy.
what a weirdo.
daddy?
how much is that doggie in the window...?
dimples and cherry cheeks, cherry cheeks, cherry cheeks get behind my counter and sell some makeup, honey.
at ease, soldier.
how'd it go in there, son?
great. We made our own record.
when she's ready, pop her on the jukebox.
I know your mom will want to hear it.
will do, dad.
baby, why are you so secretive about your songs?
cause what if you don't like 'em?
impossible.
you all done there, sugar?
looks like I am, lemon drop.
you're such a spaz!
all right, Luke. Cut it out.
face it, JP: your cousin's a fream.
so is his outcast fream girlfriend.
stick it up your wazoo, Frankenstein.
wow, classy lady, Bingo.
they can drop dead twice, Bingo, 'cause you're my star, and all we need is love.
and music.
never got a chance to ask.
how did round two go with IAD?
don't know. Bad.
so what happened?
someone snitched about Burrell.
you're kidding me. Who?
could have been anyone who knew.
Scotty, come on. You don't think it was one of us?
pick a stick.
what's it today? - Crackpot in the witness room.
says he saw a murder 54 years ago.
drawing straws.
how about we just do our job?
what's with him?
you saying you witnessed a murder?
kinda. I mean, saw
which is it, Lloyd?
I saw blood...
lots of it back in 1953.
blood isn't a murder. - I know what I saw.
you going to write this down or what?
go on.
late one night, my parents are throwing pans at each other.
I snuck out to practice pop flies.
my ball gets away from me, so I chase it down the alley behind valentine's five and dime.
the wallet belonged to Bingo Zohar.
I heard my parents talking a few days later about him being shot behind some... Blues club in point breeze.
and where was this five-and-dime you found the wallet at?
Germantown. My old neighborhood.
that's clear across Philly from Point Breeze.
it was all white in '53.
that's... What I'm saying.
you never told your parents what you saw?
shouldn't have been out, you know?
then...
just got easier not to believe my eyes, pretend it was a...
dream or something.
sounds like this memory ain't exactly crystal.
Yeah, well, maybe, uh...
this will help.
hung onto it...
54 years.
why come forward now?
my eyes. I'm losing 'em.
doc says a few more years I'll be blind.
guess I thought I tell what I saw might...
can't fix your eyes, but...
we'll try to set things right.
bingo Zohar, 19 years old.
shot and killed behind red hot mama's blues club, corner of 20th and south.
rounded up the usual suspects -- all black.
never could pin it on anyone.
cops never found the bullet that cleared Bingo's chest.
makes sense if it's only the dump site.
strange substance on Bingo's sleeve.
cops back then couldn't ID it.
if he was murdered in the five-and-dime...
changes the suspect list.
he'd recently moved from Brandywine -- old farm town.
parents died in a car accident.
he was living with the Valentine family.
uncle Ed... Aunt Julianna, cousin JP.
who's the girl? - Girlfriend.
uh... Miranda Allison.
recording booth behind the family.
typical of the old five-and-dimes.
doer dumping the body on the other side of town gets the spotlight off himself.
maybe he did it on the way home.
Arthur Brown, aka "Aces,
worked the night shift with Bingo at the five-and-dime.
Oh, lived at 22nd and south.
two blocks from the dump site.
if we're lucky, evidence still has Bingo's shirt.
send it to the lab, maybe they can ID that substance.
meanwhile, have a talk with Aces?
let's have a look around the old five-and-dime, see if we can't find that bullet.
you're kidding, right? - Afraid not.
it's been 27 years since this holistic health store was Valentine's five and dime.
that so?
kind of out of the realm of possibility that you'll find some 50-year-old bullet.
could have got lodged in a wall or a floorboard.
so what...
you think you're digging up my floors or walls?
it's not out of the realm of possibility.
these are fresh walls.
I just had them painted.
and my floors are Malaysian bamboo.
so maybe you should look somewhere else for your phantom bullet.
did you find anything during that remodel?
like a bullet?
uh... No.
cause if I find out you tampered with evidence, I'll stick you in the slammer with guys who ain't familiar with buddhist teachings.
you do, and karma will be all over your ass, pal.
Oh, I'll be all over your ass, pal...
with a warrant. - Goji berry?
they make you happy.
you eat enough, you never stop smiling.
this place looks great.
just like the stories I used to hear growing up.
Yeah, people tend to embellish the past.
red hot mama's was a dive, but a fun one.
when I came into some money,
I decided to make reopening it my pet project.
well, there's a blues resurgence
kids hearing it for the first time.
you wouldn't believe what these kids will pay for a drink.
six dollars. - Nine.
you know him or what?
I remember Bingo.
cat was one of a kind.
shot down back of this alley.
see, we think he was killed at Valentine's five and dime, where you two worked the night shift together.
I wasn't working that night with Bingo, if that's what you're implying.
I ain't implying it. I'm saying it.
I quit Valentine's the week before.
got tired of cleaning up after white folk, getting treated like dirt.
bingo treat you that way, too?
he treated me with respect.
kid was way ahead of his time in more ways than one.
now just because you're pretty and you think you're mighty wise you told me that you loved me then you rolled those big brown eyes when I saw you last week...
uh...
I apologize, sir.
Mr. Valentine's "no negro music" rule don't apply.
won't play it again.
this is Wynonie Harris, right?
you know Wynonie Harris? - Yeah.
I saw him play in a chicken shack back on Brandywine Creek, where I'm from.
heard about your folks. Sorry.
I used to sing this song for my mama.
the only thing that'd make her smile.
my daddy was a drunk, see, confused her for his punching bag.
I think it made her feel a little better hearing other people carrying it around
their pain.
let mama know she wasn't alone.
Yeah. I think I know how she felt now.
so, you're telling me your uncle lets you listen to this music?
come on.
the night he found my stash of louis jordan records, - smashed every one. - Mm.
said he wouldn't have this corrupting devil music - in his house. - Mm-hmm.
now that sound like old man Valentine.
Hey, you ever see when Wynonie Shakes his leg like this?
yeah... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
and then...
he does that spin.
Bah! Hey.
ha!
don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I could tell you've been on a spree hey, you got some pipes.
Yeah, it's my thing... Singing.
just not in front of other people usually.
Hey, you ever try this one?
got to be good friends, the two of us, listening to that music late at night.
kid was real decent.
Mr. Valentine had a problem with Bingo listening to that music?
old man feared it was the beginning of the end.
first black music, then blacks sitting at his lunch counter.
saying he would have hurt Bingo over it?
what Mr. Valentine said was law, and he had the temper to back it up, too.
but Bingo couldn't hide his love of rock 'n' roll from no one.
understand your husband, Ed Valentine, passed away a few years ago.
it'll be 12 years this Christmas. God rest his soul.
he was a good man?
Oh, yes. Ed was an officer in world war II.
we were happily married, 60 years.
where was your husband the night Bingo was killed?
asleep in his bed. Right next to mine, of course.
well, Bingo was like a son to us.
we understand your husband didn't approve of the rock 'n' roll music Bingo listened to.
no, he certainly did not.
sounds like neither did you.
the stuff was distasteful.
ed said all negro music was.
no offense, dear.
none taken.
we were a generation that made it through the depression, the war.
we wanted stability, common decency.
and "negro" music wasn't that.
well, Ed said it made the kids go wild.
and, believe you me, it did.
you're gonna be radioactive out there.
I wanna sing something real, with teeth
not the usual fake-o, happy land stuff.
doesn't matter what your song is, baby.
just matters that you're singing it.
everyone'll see what I see.
that I'm a fream.
that you're the razz's berries.
jp and the wishing stars.
I know someone's mother is proud.
now please welcome to the stage Bingo Zohar performing "Jeanie with the light brown hair.
I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair...
Boo! Hiss!
wake me when the snoozefest is over!
hold back the door and stop all the clocks
I just got the news that my baby wants to rock all she wants to do is rock all she wants to do is rock all she wants to do is rock rock 'n' roll all night long my baby don't go for fancy clothes high-class dinner and picture shows all she wants to do is stay at home and huckle buck with daddy all night long all she wants to do is rock all she wants to do is rock rock, rock all she wants to do is rock rock 'n' roll all night long...
Miranda, stop him.
stop your boyfriend from doing...
whatever it is he's doing.
he's not mine anymore.
just look at him.
all she wants to do is rock.
bingo drove the girls wild with those swiveling hips of his.
disgraceful.
kind of like Elvis. Hot.
so Miranda was pushed aside?
something you want to share, Mrs. Valentine?
shortly after Bingo's death, Miranda's mother caught her playing Russian roulette with a loaded handgun.
sent her to the State Mental Ward -- poor thing.
sounds like the "poor thing" was off her rocker.
50s, white kid singing black music
reminds me of Elvis.
I hate to admit it.
I broke up with my junior high sweetheart because she joined the Elvis fan club.
no. - Trini Rene.
back in the late '50s, the girls were either Elvis girls...
or Pat Boone girls, I remember.
I told Trini my family wouldn't approve of me going out with an Elvis girl.
I guess I was a square.
no, man, you were a cube.
my family hated Elvis too...
especially the ones who thought he ripped off black music.
he certainly was a polarizing figure.
have to be to make history.
I got the results back on the shirt.
from Bingo's sleeve?
can't believe evidence still had it after all these years.
Yeah, pretty dependable, guys in that unit.
nitrocellulose.
used primarily as a car finish back in the day.
could be from the car that dumped Bingo.
making it a long shot.
lot of cars used it.
it's back to square one.
you have a conversation with the jealous girlfriend?
I'm on it. - Have Vera go with you.
no, I got it covered.
what the hell is his problem?
where were you the night your boyfriend was shot?
bingo and I went to the drive-in.
we saw the Band Wagon with Fred Astaire.
uh, he dropped me off early. - How early?
about... 10: 00 p. m.
that was the last time I saw him.
the next morning, I received the phone call.
he was dead.
I understand you were locked up in the nuthouse.
suicide attempt.
18 and your boyfriend is murdered?
I would say that that warrants depression.
Where'd the gun come from?
my mother kept a gun in her bedside table, next to her pills.
and I bet, you're going tell me you don't have it anymore.
I didn't kill Bingo.
he was my first love, the purest of all my romances.
well, till you saw him on stage, turning the other girls on, and you got pushed to the back row.
it wasn't the girls bingo loved.
it was the music. - Yeah, right.
bingo never betrayed me.
he shared his limelight.
bingo, play that song you showed me for my girl.
she let me polish her headlights.
easy on the word - Painting, Luke.
got a lady present.
Hey, how do you get your hair like that, bingo?
Miranda's the one with the style. Ask her.
need to grow it out, but it ain't gonna hide that Franken Stein head of yours.
ha, ha.
what about you, JP? Gonna grow your hair out, too?
no. No, high and tight is right for me.
you sound like your dad.
Yeah, well, imagine what my dad would say if I came home looking like you.
who cares what he'd say?
don't be a square, JP.
bingo, someone saw that-band-stand-scout at your last show.
we hear those rumors after our shows, too.
nothing ever comes of it.
maybe we should add some rock 'n' roll beats to our line-up.
maybe dance like Bingo, instead of all this sidestepping stuff. JP the wishing stars will not be gyrating their privates on stage like a bunch of natives.
it might serve you to get some practice gyrating your privates.
JP! Come on!
it was just a joke. - Hey, come back!
the music was changing.
so were the times.
and, uh, Mr. King of the quartet was left in the dust.
and you should hear the music my granddaughter listens to:
Uh,"Milkshake" this and "Booty" that.
she made me a playlist and I learned to appreciate it.
like you learned to appreciate Bingo's music?
it took me a while. I guess I was a stick in the mud back then.
where were you the night Bingo was killed?
at wishing star practice.
like clockwork saturday nights.
you and the wishing stars ever incorporate Bingo's style into your act?
we did. As a matter of fact, we picked up some of his moves and played one of his songs, too.
yeah? Which one?
I can't remember the name, but the chorus was something like, uh,
I'll take my chance,'cause the truth be told you only get one dance - it sounds meaningful. - I liked that one.
not too racy. - Well, it wasn't always the lyrics that were racy.
it was the, the beat that unnerved people.
the beat?
things were different back then.
neighborhoods were segregated, even the music, and the beat was considered an African-American... thing.
so Bingo bringing that sort of "thing" into your world - Had repercussions. - Oh, sure.
and some people took the heat more than others.
dad, can we watch bandstand?
no one wants to watch kids dance.
that show is going to get yanked.
we're going to watch Milton Berle like we always do.
uncle Ed, you haven't received a telegram for me, have you?
hoping to hear from bandstand, actually.
they don't play your kind of music.
nothing for you, Bingo.
but JP here was accepted at Princeton.
go show him a letter, son.
didn't go to college myself.
JP, first one in the family...
I noticed that you and Bingo are pinned.
Oh, it's just for fun
ironic, actually.
ironic?
Oh, well, it's our anti-commitment to never plan for the future for the rest of our lives.
if you don't plan for a future, what will you live on?
love and music.
Miranda, I'm sure your mother has explained this to you, but your husband's livelihood will be your livelihood.
I guess I thought I'd get my own job or something.
Oh. As a teacher or a nurse?
Miranda, dear,
I suggest you secure a future for yourself before the bloom is off the rose.
you don't want to end up a penniless old maid, now, do you?
since JP is going away to college, I'll need someone to take over the store someday, so I am promoting you to counter manager, Bingo.
uh, thank you, sir, but I...
I was really hoping to focus on my music.
can we afford to give promotions right now, Ed?
mother, don't you worry your pretty little head about money.
I fired Aces anyhow.
but he's your best worker.
that job is the only thing that's keeping his family out of the poorhouse.
well, he should've thought about that before he left that devil music on the jukebox.
Oh, no, sir, I left that record on.
no need to cover for him, son.
kid's a bad apple. Now he's gone.
so Aces didn't quit. He was fired.
bingo was determined to find him.
he wanted to make it up to him somehow.
when was this?
a few days before he was killed.
aces worked five solid years for Mr. Valentine.
gets fired 'cause of Bingo.
maybe he catches up with him at the five-and-dime, gets even?
so why make the distinction of quitting... - Wake up, Miller.
the guy's covering his motive.
...unless he's covering his motive. You want to let me finish?
Scotty. We need to talk.
so go ahead. Air it out now.
cause if I got to watch you stomping around here like some bullheaded jackass one more minute, somebody's gonna lose some teeth.
ain't gonna be the only one, brother.
you really think one of us ratted you out to IAD?
you tell me.
who do you think you're talking to, Scotty?
you know us better than that.
then who was it, hmm, told that IAD jerk about Burrell?
get real, man.
you think we're the only ones who knew?
people talk, but you start turning on the people that's got your back...
it ain't your job coming after, now, is it, will?
they're out to get me, man.
using this Burrell thing as an excuse to hang me on the shoot.
IAD's on a fishing expedition. That's what they do.
Nah.
this guy won't let it go.
they want my badge.
boss'll never let that happen.
and you got to know, none of us would ever help them.
I don't get it, Will.
it was a good shoot. - Well, you did the right thing.
then why are they coming after me?
I don't know.
but you got to hang tough, circle the wagons.
and stop acting like such a jackass.
all right, then, maybe I should scream or something, so they don't think we're in here hugging.
Yeah, make it sound good.
Scotty, look!
Jeffries no cop in their right mind plays along with IAD!
they don't like us. We don't like them!
what's going on? - Scotty and will.
having a talk. - About time.
found Aces' social security records.
checks out.
he was fired a week before Bingo's murder.
picked up a part-time job finishing cars at an auto repair.
using nitrocellulose.
it's the same substance found on Bingo's sleeve the night he was killed.
hm, looks like Bingo found Aces after all.
you with Bingo night he was murdered.
found nitrocellulose on Bingo's sleeve.
from your job working on cars.
turns out you didn't quit the five-and-dime. you were fired.
I lose everything 'cause some white kid forgets to take a record off the juke, while Mr. Valentine spends his night pawing the makeup girl behind his office door?
world ain't just.
so you got even. - You could say that.
I saw Bingo that night, standing about where you are now.
why lie about it, Aces? - Why do you think?!
grew up black, didn't you?
maybe it was different for you, but for my generation the color lines weren't drawn exactly fair.
talk about that night.
treated the kid bad.
stomped on his dream...
you ain't nothin' but a hound dog been snoopin' 'round my door you ain't nothin' but a hound dog been snoopin' 'round my door you can wag your tail but I ain't gonna feed you no more you told me you were high-class but I could see through that...
you're a hard man to find.
...but I could see through that...
it ain't right what my uncle did.
he's trying to give me a promotion. I told him I wouldn't take it.
man, you really don't get it, do you?
what?
we do not live in the same world.
this is two towns.
rules ain't the same in both.
you think it's hlep to dress like a colored man, sing like a colored man?
that make you cool?
but you don't suffer the consequences of a colored man.
do you?
no. I don't.
that ain't right.
Hey, but this music...
it's the only thing that speaks to me.
you don't even know what it means.
you don't think I know about loss?
about wanting the pain to go away, but it won't?
about living when you think you can't go on.
I'd be lost without my music.
then sing it like you mean it.
make it your own.
how do I do that?
ain't you always, uh, scribbling something down? Your songs?
not ready to share that yet.
then get out of my face.
Mrs. Valentine told me you turned down the promotion.
how could you?!
Miranda?! What are you doing here?
what about our future?!
you have to take it!
you have to tell Mr. Valentine you will right now.
keep it down.
what has gotten into you?
don't tell me to keep it down!
let's talk out back.
so Miranda came here the night Bingo was murdered?
brought her out back to talk.
same place his body was dumped.
bingo and I went "to the drive-in.
saw the Band Wagon with Fred Astaire.
he dropped me off early.
but you saw him later that night.
behind Red Hot Mama's.
that wasn't me.
you panicked.
demanded bingo take that promotion.
secure his future.
and yours.
so what happened to living on love and music, Miranda?
I lost faith in myself.
in us.
there were no opportunities for me then.
I was terrified I'd be dependent on a broke musician the rest of my life.
Mrs. Valentine got to you.
the times got to me.
I didn't want to end up like my mother.
nobody does.
and so...
I told Bingo he had to give up everything that he was.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Bingo, but Mrs. Valentine is right.
I can't be a nurse.
blood makes me queasy.
and I'm not gonna be a teacher.
why not?
kids think I'm weird.
we'll make it on my music.
no.
I have to hurry before my rose is off the bloom.
I think your rose is just fine.
you love me, right, Bingo?
of course I do.
then we should get married.
settle down.
buy a house, a car, start a savings account.
you'll need a job -- a steady paycheck.
no. We don't need any of that.
we've got love and music, the only things that are real anyhow.
huh, you remember?
bingo, if that telegram from bandstand were coming, it would have made it already.
it's time to grow up.
you need to be realistic about the limitations of your talent.
you're just not...
that talented.
but we can be happy together.
settled.
safe.
right, Bingo?
I'll talk to my uncle.
he's probably still at the store.
I love you, Bingo
it was a lie, of course.
bingo was tremendously talented.
but talent ain't the same as security.
Mmm.
and the next morning Bingo was dead.
turns out...
security doesn't exist.
what's up?
warrant came through on the old five-and-dime.
feel like fishing for a bullet?
what do we got?
did some more digging on nitrocellulose.
turns out it was used for making records.
the old recording booth in the five-and-dime.
you know, if Bingo was recording when he got shot, he could have fallen back into the record.
looks like karma's on our side today.
.40 or .45.
wasn't common back in the '50s.
street thugs were using .38 revolvers then.
but my father had a .45...
world war II military issue.
he an officer like uncle Ed?
war hero, too.
know Ed worked nights at the five-and-dime.
getting made over by the makeup girl.
if Bingo caught him, it could've turned ugly.
you husband was at home with you
no the night of Bingo's murder.
he was at the five-and-dime, wasn't he?
I'm not sure.
frankly, it was so long ago.
spent a lot of nights at the store, old Ed.
and not by his lonesome, either.
I used to tell myself that she was for his urges.
I was the one he truly loved.
now you know I'm a fool.
we found a bullet.
matches the type of gun Mr. Valentine used in the war.
ed was a philanderer, but he...
he-he never would've hurt his own nephew's own blood.
his own blood caught him with his pants down.
could've ruined his marriage, his reputation.
isn't it time to stop protecting your husband?
ed wasn't with me that night.
but he wasn't at the store, either.
Oh, sorry to scare you.
Oh, no, you didn't scare me.
I'm just, um, uh, looking for uncle Ed.
Oh, he's at the store, dear.
no, ma'am. I just came from there, and, uh, he...
it's one thing when he's doing it behind closed doors, but to go out with her...
someone could see.
my marriage just one big stinking lie, and I am a fool to believe otherwise.
but it isn't foolish to believe.
if only I had gone to college,
I could've done something with my life.
I dropped out for him.
to start a family.
a home.
well, maybe it isn't too late.
it is for me.
but I was good at it.
I loved it, you know.
nobody should keep you from doing what you love.
there's something I need to show you.
that's from bandstand.
they saw you perform, Bingo, and they liked you.
a lot.
they want a record to play for their producers...
by tomorrow morning.
well, you'd better hurry.
Oh...
use the recording booth at the store.
but I don't know what to sing.
well, you must have something.
I have an original, actually, been puzzling together.
not ready, though.
can't get the chorus right.
let-let's hear it.
uh...
I'll take my chance 'cause truth be told you only get one life to live.
I... it just doesn't work.
chance -- you can't rhyme chance with chance.
dance.
you only get one dance.
that's it.
that's great.
I'll take my chance 'cause truth be told you only get one dance.
what if I'm no good?
what if you are?
no one should stop you from doing what you love, Bingo.
ed came in a few minutes later...
reeking of cheap perfume and whiskey.
and you never left him.
I should've.
but then Bingo...
I stayed.
arranged the funeral.
kept up appearances.
it was easier.
that chorus
...you ever tell anyone about it?
no. Why?
I'll take my chance
cause truth be told you only get one dance.
you weren't at wishing star practice, JP.
you were at home.
you must be confused.
we talked to your old pals.
they kicked you out.
wanted to play rock 'n' roll.
not you, though.
you heard your mother confess she was trapped in a loveless marriage, and that your father was a philanderer.
before Bingo came along, everything made sense.
you father was a great war hero, your mother the doting housewife.
and you...
the golden boy everyone wanted to be.
but Bingo had that new style
that cool, new sound.
and everyone in your life started changing because of him.
no. Bingo was a fream.
he didn't have the power to change people.
but he did.
that's why you had to get rid of him.
restore your world to its rightful place.
do you really think that I could shoot my own cousin?
no.
you didn't need to...
but it happened.
I just wanted him... to leave.
I wanted my life back the way it was.
so you took your father's gun to scare him off.
but he wouldn't listen, would he?
I...
just...
wanted him...
gone.
I'm taking my chance 'cause truth be told, you only get one dance gee, JP, you scared me half to death.
we have to leave now.
what?
I'm taking you back to Brandywine, where you belong.
what's wrong with you?
I heard the lies that you made my mother say.
I'm about the only one not lying.
everything was perfect until you came.
perfect?
what's so perfect about a smart woman like your mom baking cookies instead of following her dream?
or a guy like Aces getting fired just 'cause he's colored?
shut up!
you don't know anything.
what's perfect about Miranda out of her gourd 'cause she's scared she's nothing without a man.
it's a twisted world, JP.
it ain't all puppy dogs and holding hands.
open your eyes.
I was happy.
everyone was happy.
my family was happy.
and I'm going to make sure they're happy again.
I know times are changing and for the good.
and I'm seeing to it the only way I know how.
not if I can help it.
the followin story is ficeional and does not depict any actual person or event
28706.0
all right, everybody.
it's time for a fast...
skate!
ready?
I was born ready.
good,'cause today's the day I'm going to kick your butt.
why, you been practicing on the side?
Oh, that's for me to know and you to find out, all right.
Hey, so I heard they're trying to get roller skating into the 1980 Olympics.
wow, it's about time.
and if we train really hard, maybe we can make it.
it would be so cool to win a medal.
can you imagine being that good?
Yep.
I'm going to beat you one of these days.
Oh, dream on.
all right here we go
this is Dawn Whelan. She claims to have information on an old case.
captain Fashion says if I tell you what I know, I get one of those downward departures.
well, that's up to the judge.
all we can do is listen.
you made it sound like a done deal.
well, tell us what you got.
if we think it's worth investigating, we'll see what we can do.
high school girl was found dead in Fairmount Park back in '78.
all over the news.
you never found the guy who did it, did you?
you saw the guy?
no.
but I saw the van she was getting in.
in the park? - No.
outside a roller rink in Mayfair.
one of those customized vans, had a picture painted on the side.
what kind of picture?
a spaceship.
you see little green men, too?
I know what I saw.
what color was the van? - Black.
what were you doing outside the rink?
smoking a little herbal remedy.
and did you know Missy?
I'd seen her around the rink.
girl could skate. - But you didn't say anything in '78.
my jackass boyfriend boosted a car the next night.
we hightailed it to Florida.
got the "gimme"s in a bunch of liquor stores.
just couldn't say no to old Captain Morgan.
what they got you for now? - Armed robbery.
looking at ten to 12.
but what I told you, that's got to be worth something, right?
we'll let you know. - That's it?
I got to go back to lockup?
that girl's family's been in the dark for 30 years while you sat on that information.
I think you and Captain Fashion can sweat a few days while we check if your story holds water.
okay, Dawn?
ever go to the roller rink back in the '70s?
roller disco back then.
like a regular club, just on skates.
I had the ones that clipped on your sneakers.
I used a key to tighten them.
outdoor skates. Old school.
I spent hours patrolling the neighborhood.
I was more into the night scene.
Ah, rocking the leisure suit? - Watch yourself now.
I bet I'm faster.
trust me, Lil...
different leagues.
Missy Gallavan, 15 years old.
a jogger discovered her body in a ravine in Fairmount Park, near Tacony Creek.
time of death around midnight.- Blunt-force trauma to the head, possibly from a fall.
abrasions on her knees and palms, broken fingernails...
they had a series of assaults in the park that summer.
mother said she was a tomboy, but it looks like she went parking with the wrong guy.
you could fill a book with the things teenage girls don't tell their mothers.
the mother Simone was a legal secretary, worked until 2: 00 a. m. that night.
well, Missy had gone to the rink with a girl named Julie Reed.
they split up around 10: 00, but no one saw her take off.
that leaves two hours unaccounted for.
anything could have happened.
blue fibers found on the body.
looked like carpet.
could be shag from the spaceship van?
it was the '70s.
they save the nail clippings?
it looks like, but no DNA in '78, so they couldn't test them.
let's get them from Evidence, send them to the lab.
we got science on our side now.
my daughter never would have gone to the park with some stranger.
Missy wasn't who they made her out to be.
well, we're not here to judge your daughter, Mrs. Gallavan.
I know what the police and everybody else thought.
well, we're looking into a possible new lead on her murder.
did you or Missy know anyone with a customized van?
why, you think someone with a van hurt Missy?
maybe someone she went to school with? From the neighborhood?
I didn't really know anybody in the neighborhood.
after my husband and I split up, Missy and I moved into an apartment in Mayfair that summer.
was Missy's father in the picture?
he took off for California with his dental hygienist.
wanted a "fresh start."I went back to work.
Missy told you she was going to the rink with a friend?
I trusted my daughter.
Missy knew if she couldn't get a ride home, she could call and I'd come and pick her up.
did she ever call that night?
it's the first time I let her go with that Julie.
and look what happened. - Julie Reed?
Missy had met her a couple of weeks before at the apartment complex.
I should never have let her get mixed up with a girl like that.
I've seen you at the rink.
you're p pretty good.
Thanks.
can you shoot the moon?" - " I'm more of a fast skater.
I could maybe show you a few things...
if you wanted.
sure.
once you know some spins and stuff, we can go to the rink at night.
the real action happens after 9: 00.
Oh, that's for over 18. I'm only 15.
they won't let me in.
they will if you're with me.
I have connections.
you know, you could be pretty if you wore a little makeup, played up your eyes.
Oh, I'm really bad with all that.
lucky for you, I'm an expert.
we're about the same size. I could lend you clothes.
what's wrong with my clothes?
by the time I'm done, you won't recognize yourself.
Julie was, uh...fast. A lot of attitude.
she told detectives she was at the rink with Missy before they got split up.
Yeah, that's what she said, all right.
some friend she turned out to be.
uh-uh, no way.
last time you hooked me up, the guy wore flip-flops and forgot his wallet.
onions? - Sure.
no, Mom, I'm not talking to you.
cheese? - Heart attack special.
heart attack. - Okay, okay, fine. Thanks, Jake. But you're babysitting.
what?
my mother met some guy at church, and now I have a date tomorrow night.
that a bad thing? - You ever had a good blind date?
I don't do blind dates.
I like to see what I'm getting into. - Yeah, me, too.
I talked to a buddy in Narcotics.
most of the guys that detailed vans in the '70s are tattoo artists or T-shirt airbrushers now.
what kind of loser paints a spaceship on their car?
it was the '70s. Star Wars, that Boston album...
parliament Funkadelic.- Uh-uh, brothers were not painting spaceships on vans.
not anymore.
those guys got your mom down at church setting them up on blind dates now.
see, now, that was uncalled for.
pretty isolated up here, especially at night.
just that one streetlight up on the road.
the string of assaults on the park in '78, everyone knew not to come here after dark.
tell a teenager not to do something, it just makes them want do it more.
Yeah, so say she meets a guy at the rink.
they get in his van, come here for some quality time.
things start to heat up...
or don't get as hot as he wants it.
she fights back, and he blows a fuse.
tosses her over the edge.
done and done.
or she gets out of the car, starts to run...
it's dark; she can't see where the pavement ends...
wham, she hits the wall, topples over.
Humpty Dumpty.
one nasty fall.
Yeah.
you do any artwork on vans back in the '70s?
Yeah, right. - I am sure your sunsets would rock my world, sir, but I'm only interested in spaceships.
I talked to 33 guys.
not jack squat.
Oh, dudes smoked out all their brain cells. - Yeah, uh, Rufus?
uh, you do any artwork on vans back in the '70s?
yeah? Spaceships?
you're kidding.
I got to go run an errand. - Hair appointment, right?
you better quit now.
uh, yeah, Rufus?
how long were you and Missy friends, Julie?
uh, just a few weeks before that night.
she'd just moved into the building.
your idea to go to the rink that night, adult skate?
I had a lot of bad ideas back then.
I'm sure you remember 15.
is that you?- My daughter, Tiffany
can't get enough of that retro fashion.
uniforms on, girls! We leave for practice in ten minutes!
lots of guys. She was a cute girl.
any drove a customized van, a spaceship painted on the side?
spaceship. No.
stoners weren't really my scene.
well, what was your scene, Julie?
anywhere I could get in. I knew how to handle myself.
but it was all still pretty fresh for Missy.
how'd you two get separated that night?
met a cute guy. Got distracted.
I know her mother still blames me for what happened.
truth is, I was the kind of girl I try to keep my daughters away from.
it's amazing.
totally different than daytime.
daytime's for kids.
you want a man, not a boy, right?
I'm...
not really sure about the whole dating thing.
try it. You'll like it.
I'm still getting used to my mom dating.
you ever miss your dad?
not much to miss.
last time I saw him, we went to Wanamaker's to see Santa.
I think I was four.
there's a lot of talent here tonight.
now, if a guy grabs your hips during "Loco-Motion,
that means he's into you. - Okay.
and if he asks what you do, just say,"Taking some classes.
it makes you sound older, and it's sort of true.
smart! - I know, right?
and don't worry if you get nervous or run out of things to say.
just flip your hair. Guys think it's sexy.
like this?
perfect.
summer night, just out looking for fun.
turned out to be the worst night of my life.
who was the guy getting handsy with Missy?
Rick, the DJ.
he was, like, a local celebrity.
we were friends.- DJ's friends with 15-year-old girls?
he would get us into the over-18, let us hang out in his booth.
he was harmless.
Rick's DJ booth.
shag carpet?
it was the '70's. What else?
tragic what happened to that girl.
I heard she was some skater.
you remember letting her into the adult skate, Rick?
Hey, the outfits those girls wore, they could go wherever they wanted.
that why you decided to do the "Loco-Motion" with her?
I was the DJ.
I always came out and grabbed a body for that song. Never heard a lady complain.
the way I heard it, you had your share of underage groupies doing time in your DJ booth.
they all looked 18 to me. - A player like you, I bet you had a sweet ride back then.
maybe a cool, customized van?
no. I was an AMX man.
it was a fast ride, and the seats fully reclined.
what time did you leave the rink?
I didn't; I stayed there all night with some friends, partying.
these friends gonna back that up?
Yeah, it may take a while, but I can probably track 'em down.
how about you toss me your digits and I'll call you with their info?
well, how about you give me their names and leave the detective work to me?
sure you never gave Missy a spin in your booth?
come on.
there were so many girls back then, I lost count.
Oh, let me refresh your memory.
you skated with her, and she wound up dead a few hours later.
I'm a lover, not a killer, baby.
Yeah. Look, she was cute.
I might have grabbed her.
but this girl had someone else on her tail that night.
what's your sign?
um, Pisces.
you are one foxy little fish.
what the hell, man? - Watch your hands, man.
you touch me again, and I'll rearrange your face, kid.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I called your house.
some guy said you'd be here.
what are you wearing?
your face is all shiny. - It's glitter makeup.
brings out my eyes. - Look, Missy, you shouldn't be here.
the guys are all pervy and old.
anyway, where have you been? You haven't come to Fast Skate in weeks.
Julie's been teaching me some new tricks.
I can shoot the moon. - Shoot the moon?
what about the Olympics, huh, or are you too cool for that now?
just...
leave me alone, Hugh, would you?
sure, I could have taken the guy, but he seemed jacked on something.
did you see him with Missy later that night?
no, but then again, I wasn't exactly keeping tabs on her.
I don't need those reindeer games. - Of course not.
you were king of the rink, huh? - You know it.
we do a '70s night here on Saturdays.
it's off the hook.
you should come by. Give you the special VIP treatment.
so I go down to Evidence to pick up Missy's nail clippings.
Mr. Happy Meal behind the counter keeps stonewalling, finding reasons why I can't have them.
I know that guy. Loves to talk.
we go in circles for an hour.
finally, he admits the box holding them-- get this-- four rows back.
well, hey, that's gotta be ten, 12 feet.
Oh, he's not going to waddle his fast food self all that way.
afraid the Hamburglar will grab him. - Unbelievable.
finally went and got the damn box myself.
we locate that other kid from the rink yet?
grew up in her old neighborhood.
I can't decide whether this guy's creepy or just plain sad.
pulled up his MySpace page.
single male in his 40s, never married.
still looking for that "special connection.
cross-check him with vehicle registration?
I don't even think he had a learner's permit back in '78, but he did call the house that night asking for Missy; some guy answered, said she was at the rink.
the mother aware of this? - Got a call in to Simone.
going through old statements, boyfriends.
if there's a man with a van, we'll find him.
any progress on those nail clippings? - At the lab now, being tested for DNA.
will put a hurtin' on Mr. Happy Meal.
get your nails done, killer?
shut up.
so, where are you kids headed tonight?
think I'm gonna cancel. The regular dating's hard enough.
for a single mom, it's impossible.
yeah...
why bother? Get yourself some sweatpants and park it on the couch.
you make it sound so bad.
Oh, you'll go toe-to-toe with some jacked-up gangbanger, but you're afraid of a little blind date your mom's met at church?
sorry about that. Cat told me to ink his girl's name across his back: Sheryl with an "S.
turns out she spells it with a "C."
well, talk spaceships, Rufus.
said on the phone you remember spraying one on a van back in the day?
Yeah, cat was a big Boston fan.
thought they were gonna be the next Stones.
so much for his crystal-balling.
I keep my old stuff in here for inspiration.
you remember the guy's name? - Just called him Boston.
you got great skin.
make an excellent canvas.
Yeah, here it is.
Thanks, Rufus.
we'll try to get this back to you.
are we good? - Yeah, we're good.
Yeah, Missy and I grew up on the same block.
we were skate buddies since kindergarten.
Oh, sounds like you two had a real connection.
the Missy I knew was a tomboy.
she used to talk about training for the Olympics.
the guy who answered the phone at Missy's place told you she was at the rink?
did you recognize his voice? - Figured it was her mom's boyfriend.
did it occur to you to mention that to the police in '78?
well, the papers said some creep picked her up in the park, but I take it you already know that.
saw your MySpace page, Hugh.
still looking for that special connection?
who isn't? - Well, you seemed pretty particular to Missy back in the day.
I told you we were friends.
going after her and the guy she's with isn't really friend behavior, is it?
that DJ was a creep.
no argument here, but you were angry with her.
I wasn't mad at her. I was worried about her.
funny way of showing it. - When Missy moved away, she just fell off the map.
when I finally see her again, the way she looked...
it just wasn't her.
look, I'm...I'm really sorry about before.
I-I haven't heard from you since you moved.
I was gonna call you, but...
things have been kind of messed up.
my mom works all the time.
and she's got this slimy boyfriend.
he's always around. - This guy...
did he do something?
missy, it's me. I mean, you can tell me anything.
the other night...
we were watching TV, and he...
he touched my hair.
it creeped me out.
what are you going to do about it?
stay out of his way.
so, what have you been doing all summer?
well, I found this new place.
you're gonna love it.
we can go now if you want to, on my bike.
tear it up like we used to.
I promised Julie I'd do the dance contest with her later.
but I can come by your house tomorrow.
we'll start training then. - Okay.
I waited on my front steps all day, but she just never showed.
What'd you do after you left Missy?
rode my bike home; I had to get up at 5: 00 in the morning for my paper route.
pretty much quit skating after that.
it just wasn't the same without Missy.
plates from the van came back registered to a Joe Bosquay.
he got a sheet? - That name, Bosquay...
in '91, his 16-year-old stepdaughter charged him with sexual assault.
the charges were dropped, but...
where there's smoke... - And Joe Bosquay alibi'd out in '78.
Jacuzzi salesman, dated the mother.
Simone's boyfriend. - Well, Simone backed him up, said he wasn't around.
Yeah, well, we got 30 years of history since then not backing Joe up.
now, according to Hugh, the guy was putting the moves on Missy a few days before she died.
bring him in? - The mother, too.
maybe she knows more than she's been letting on.
homicide Stillman.
just a minute.
it's Miller...
and she's pretending to be someone else. She sounds drunk.
Miller? You sure?
she's asking for you, Scotty.
get in, lush.
I would've called a cab, but I was late, left the house without my wallet.
so, what's wrong with the guy? - Nothing.
good-looking, manners, ordered a nice bottle of wine.
I just drank half of it before the calamari came.
Ah, you were nervous. It's a rookie mistake.
I don't have the time or energy for the game.
bring on the sweatpants.
you, you say good-bye to him, or just go to the bathroom, never come back?
Oh, that's cold, man.
you got to call him tomorrow.
make up some kind of work emergency.
Hmm-mm, I'm not calling him. This was a one-shot deal.
one and done. - Aw, come on, Kat.
you got to get back in the game.
got no game, baby. Game over.
it's a shame. You're still a pretty good catch.
yeah? - Just saying.
you deserve more.
damn straight.
Lousy-ass cop, though.
take me home before I puke all over your car.
you got it.
that's a name I'd rather forget.
but he was your boyfriend?
not for long.
he was just the first guy to look at me after my husband left.
turns out I wasn't a very good judge of character.
you didn't tell us he drove a van.
big spaceship on it. - He didn't drive a van.
he drove a convertible. - You sure about that?
he kept the top down all the time.
I had to wear a scarf to keep my hair from blowing around.
the van was registered to Joes business.
I've never seen it before.
Why?
was Joe ever home when you weren't?
no. Not that I know of.
did he have a key to your apartment?
no. - Ever keep an extra key outside your door, maybe for Missy?
Oh, my God.
you don't think...
you ever been arrested, Joe? - Nope. My record's clean.
only 'cae your stepdaughter Celeste didn't proceed with her case against you.
bitch was a liar.
it was his van.
and Joe picked up Missy at the rink.
no, no, no, th-that's not possible. I-I would have known.
we have an eyewitness, Simone.
God, I brought that man into my house.
da said Celeste's mother pressured her to walk away.
you had her convinced you were some kind of Prince Charming.
so much for maternal instinct.
fibers found on Missy's body came back from the lab.
american Blue shag.
one of the options offered on the '76 Chevy Van 20.
perfect match for your model van.
I never touched Missy.
Missy ever try to talk to you about Joe?
She...she...
told me something once.
a-a day or two before she died, but...
but what, Simone?
I thought it was about something else.
look! It's called "Shoot the moon." - That's terrific!
Oh, you should come to the rink with me sometime.
we'd have so much fun.
maybe Joe could come, too.
he's a great dancer. I bet he's a great skater, too.
do you think Joe really loves you?
the way you and Dad loved each other...
before?
Oh, honey.
your dad-- he's not coming back.
I know that.
you've had a lot to adjust to this summer.
you have been such a trooper.
but you and me...
we're a family.
we don't need anyone else. Right?
nobody will ever replace your dad.
but whoever it is I'm dating, you have to give him a chance.
I know, and I did, but Joe's not the guy for you, Mom.
you are too picky, honey.
maybe you're not picky enough.
I just thought she missed her father.
she was trying not to hurt your feelings.
it's all my fault.
that bastard!
you were in the apartment that night. You answered the phone.
so? Missy wanted a ride home.
which you never told her mother or the cops back then?
the kid ended up dead that night.
it would have looked bad. - Because it was bad!
you picked her up at the rink, took her to the park!
No!
she never went anywhere with me.
Where's my mom?
Where'd you get this van? - She's still at work.
I really need her right now.
Yeah, well...
you got me.
come on. I need your help inside.
all right.
Julie, wake up. I brought help. We're going to get you out of here.
do you have any idea how young these girls are? This is not cool.
look, man, I... - This is not cool at all.
I wouldn't want to be you if the cops get wind of this.
if somebody gave them the wrong impression.
maybe this will keep you quiet?
Julie can stay till she sleeps it off?
and we'll all forget this ever happened.
forget what? Let's scram, Missy.
we got places to go and people to see.
aren't you going to do something?
let's go. - I'm not leaving Julie alone.
I am not going anywhere with you.
you're disgusting.
you don't want to come, that's your deal, but, uh,
I don't think your mom is gonna to be too thrilled at how you're spending your time.
I guess now you and I have a secret.
they were Rick's problem after that.
I mean, I didn't need that kind of headache.
where did you go after you left the rink?
I went to my friend Anita's.
that, uh, lady loved her some nose candy.
it made her real grateful.
more grateful than Simone?
Simone wasn't around.
a man has needs.
I'm torn, Joe.
I can't decide if you're too old for me to feed you your teeth.
Mrs. Gallavan.
you were supplying drugs to minors. Trying to get over on underage girls.
I didn't... - You lied, Rick.
you did see Missy again that night.
her friend Julie was high as a kite, thanks to you.
so you made sure Missy stayed silent.
the last time I saw those girls, they were very much alive.
she's freezing, Rick.
she needs a doctor!
Rick, what's going on?
your friend brought her old man. That's what's going on.
I want you two brats out now!
don't even think about coming back.
I didn't kill that girl.
I just wanted her to take her friend and go home!
you saying Missy left with Julie?
gave her that roller-skating jacket.
she was cleaning up my mess.
guess I owe her a thanks. - Sure you're done jerking us around, Rick?
nothing else?
that's all I got. Talk to Julie.
good. We will. - What the hell?
you got six outstanding tickets for moving violations in Potter County.
tickets? - Well, 1,400 bucks ain't no joke.
potter County PD's on their way downstate to pick you up.
long drive. Could take all night.
see if we can find a nice big cellmate you can "do the Loco-Motion" with.
who's the foxy fish now?
Julie's been marinating for a while.
should be about ready to talk now.
tell her you'd be right there?
Yup, about an hour ago.
nice. So, you call him?
what are you now, my life coach? - Apparently I'm your driver.
never living that down.
call him.
why am I here? I told you everything I knew when you were at my house.
except the part about you going home with Missy that night.
who told you that? - Your good buddy, Rick, the DJ.
the cute guy you hooked up with that night.
he didn't think you were so cute after you passed out on his couch, though.
he gave me some pills. I barely remember that night.
you remember how Missy got your sorry butt out of there.
no, I blacked out. - Yeah, that's bull.
she had your back. Put her jacket on you, took you home.
same jacket you kept all these years.
let your daughter wear it.
why is that, Julie?
Tiffany found it in the attic. I didn't know it was there.
you kept it for a reason. Couldn't bring yourself to get rid of it.
something happened between you two, at the rink or on the way home.
what was it, Julie?
for all my talk, I was still a virgin when I went to the rink that night.
when I got home, I realized I wasn't anymore.
it was Rick?
I remember messing around, and then things got fuzzy.
next thing I knew, Missy was there, and he was kicking us out.
she came back for you, Julie.
you owe it to her now to tell the truth.
all she did was help me.
and I was terrible to her.
what happened, Julie?
if I'd been a better friend, she would still be alive today.
do you still feel sick? - Don't even talk to me.
you're mad at me?
I invited you into my world and you blew it.
you've ruined everything!
I was just trying to help...
well, you didn't. Rick was going to be my boyfriend, and now he'll never speak to me again.
were you guys...
how else do you think I got into the over-18? It's not because I'm such a great skater.
he's a jerk. You'll find somebody cooler.
someone our age.
boys our age are idiots.
and older guys aren't?
I had kind of a fight with my mom's boyfriend.
can I sleep over your house tonight?
after what you did?
I never want to speak to you again.
but I don't have any place to go.
that's your problem, not mine.
that's the last time I saw her.
that whistle...
someone she knew?
I didn't look back to see.
I'll never forgive myself.
all this time we've been looking for a guy in a van who took Missy to the park that night.
didn't think too much about a boy on a bike.
it's tough when you're 15.
all the girls move on to older guys.
all of a sudden, you're just a squeaky-voiced little kid with a paper route.
that what Missy thought of you? - Missy wasn't like that.
how come you never married, Hugh?
just never found the right girl?
or maybe you did.
only she just wasn't that into you.
we were just friends.
but you wanted it to be more.
no, it wasn't like that. - It's always that way with guys, Hugh.
that's why you came back for her.
you whistled to her, to let her know you were there.
just like you always did when you were kids.
only she wasn't interested anymore.
and you'd come so far, put in all that time.
only Missy was a fighter. - What?
no, no, you got it all wrong. - No, we don't.
we got your skin under her fingernail clippings, Hugh.
and your DNA on that can to prove it.
it was all my fault.
what was your fault, Hugh?
I didn't...
I didn't know what she wanted.
see I didn't, I didn't realize...
all she really needed was a friend.
I just let it get all turned around.
Oh, I can't believe you brought an extra pair.
they're my old ones, but, uh, they're adjustable.
figured they'd come in handy someday.
I'm out of practice, but I bet I can still take you.
Yeah, we'll see.
you okay? - Yeah, I'm great.
never felt better.
well, if it wasn't for this bum wheel, I totally would have aced you.
Oh, but my hair got caught on my lip gloss, slowed me down.
tomorrow I'll be dressed right...
whole other race.
Yeah, so you say.
tonight really sucked.
but this...
now...
it kind of makes it all okay.
what are you doing?
no, no, I-I just...
and I thought we were friends.
I thought I could trust you.
well, no, no. You, you, you can trust me. I thought that...
after everything that's happened today, I can't believe you!
missy, Missy, I'm sorry...
missy, please!
look, we can go back to the way things used to be, okay?
forget it ever happened, okay? We can go back to the way things were!
get off me!
missy, no!

are we clear? - Yeah!
shall we go sell some cars?
let's go sell some cars.
can I talk to you a sec?
the phones aren't gonna answer themselves, sweetheart.
I know, it's just, um, things are real tight for me right now.
Oh, looking for an advance?

guy probably wanted the taillights.
Donna D'Amico, age 22, went missing back in '81.
anyone notify next of kin?
we're trying to locate her mother who filed the missing persons report.
the car don't belong to her.
the keys don't fit.
and the VIN number plate's gone.
a '73.
cars had confidential VIN numbers that far back?
should be buried in there somewhere.
it's probably on the frame or under the engine block.
whoever dumped her knew what they were doing.
the fat slob at the gate said they don't inspect cars at intake.
the place should advertise to criminals: Dump-Jobs-R-Us.
let's tow the car.
let the Auto Squad take it apart in the garage. hello is Stillman
what is it?
a scrap of paper with some names and some numbers.
still make out the ballpoint.
Lester, 1,200 bucks. Somebody she owed money?
the address at the top's faded out.
see if QD can pull it up?
I'll run the name Lester against titles on '73 Eldorados.
Donna's mother passed away eight years ago.
only surviving next of kin is her daughter, Marisa.
how old was she back in '81 when her mom disappeared?
five.
I'll handle the notification.
it was a good thing we got to her before the cruncher.
Donna D'Amicl, 22-year-old single mom took the bus to Steed Motors where she worked as a greeter.
boss says she left at 7: 00 P. M. the day she disappeared.
never returned to pick up her daughter from the sitter.
witness statements back in '81?
nothing indicating foul play. Like she vanished.
only after she emptied her bank account: 400 bucks.
any guys in the picture?
no husband, no degree, bad credit, crap job with limited prospects.
assigned figured she skipped town; ditched the kid and a miserable situation.
wouldn't be the first. - We got any other friends or family?
friend Paula coming in.
she was sitting the kid the night she disappeared. - What about the daughter?
Marisa D'Amico. She's not returning our phone calls. Rush is hunting her down.
checked registrations on all '73 Eldorados No hits on the name "Lester."
check the dealership. See if there ever was a guy that name worked on that lot.
I hate car salesman.
you could use a new ride.
what's wrong with my car?
nothing, if you like being single.
excuse me. Is that, um, Marisa?
I've called before about your mother.
my mother walked out when I was five.
we just found her body.
where? - In the trunk of a car out in Elmwood.
might explain what happened to her.
can't say it's a real shock.
given her choice in men.
anyone in particular?
I was referring to the loser who knocked her up in high school.
your dad.
got to be around to earn that title. Never en met him.
who'd you grow up with?
grandmother raised me...who wasn't expecting to.
reminded me constantly.
I know you were young, but if there's anything you can remember about your mom:
what she was involved in...
only thing I remember was we never had any money or a place of our own.
the name "Lester" mean something to you?
no.
did she leave anything behind, personal effects?
sorry, all I know is the police said she cleaned out her bank account.
couldn't get away fast enough.
you think of anything, let me know.
always knew something must have happened.
Donna never would have just taken off.
she loved that kid.
you were babysitting Marisa the night she disappeared?
we were good friends in high school.
dodged a baby bullet myself.
figured I'd help her out whenever I could.
any guys she was involved with at the time?
dating was a hassle for her, the kid and all.
she was really struggling to make it on her own.
any idea why she emptied her bank account before she disappeared?
no, but it couldn't have been much.
Donna didn't have two nickels.
she owe anybody? Someone named Lester?
wasn't like her. She hated to borrow.
was a real blow when she had to move back in with her mom.
I wouldn't wish that woman on anyone.
you worked with her at the dealership?
helped her get the job as a greeter.
quit 'cause I couldn't stand it anymore.
bunch of sexist sharks.
no idea why she wanted to swim in that tank.
steed Motors.
I'll transfer you to Service. Hold.
Hi, Mommy.
Aw, geez, Paula, I totally forgot.
Hi, boo!
I gotta run, Donna. I told you I got a date tonight.
Yeah, I just gotta close out.
just a few things.
Donna, hold all my calls, will ya, doll?
clear my next appointment.
tell Mickey the fleet sales can wait.
I want to make sure we get Mr. Callahan here all squared away tonight.
certainly, sir.
now, George, if I can get him to throw in the floor mats with the rustproofing, do we have a deal?
come on, Frank. I stole that guy's trade-in.
the deal should have been two-pounder, easy.
would you lower your voice, please?
you got a problem, take it up with Mickey.
please, sir, wait. Sir, please.
someone has misplaced Mr. Hathaway's keys to the Chevy Nova.
I'll get right on that, Sanil.
perhaps Mr. Hathaway would like to take one of our vehicles home tonight, huh?
tell you what, sir.
take the car home.
bring it back tomorrow, huh? - Donna.
Yeah. - Stay late tonight?
Yeah, you know, about that Mickey, I've been busting my hump around here.
we all appreciate your hump, babe. - yeah
just give me a chance, all right? Let me sell a car.
who's gonna do your job, sweetheart, hmm?
you know that Lincoln Mark trade that came in yesterday?
I know someone right now I could flip it to.
all right, we'll see.
what about tonight?
Hey, you want your shot?
pay your dues. Pay your dues.
I gotta stay late.
can you drop Marisa off at my mom's, please?
all right, all right.
Bye, baby.
single mom, no degree, what are you gonna do?
we found Donna's body in the trunk of a '73 Eldorado.
you know anybody who drove that kind of car?
no, but I wouldn't know a K-car from a Carolla.
that was Donna's thing.
she could tell the car a guy drove by the shoes he wore.
lot of late nights at the dealer?
maybe too many.
I know it was really hard on little Marisa.
but her mom did the best that she could.
boss, Auto Squad found a VIN number on that Eldorado.
tracked the DMV records on the owner.
Marshall Brooks. We got him?
he died a couple years ago but he traded in the Caddy to Steed Motors the week before Donna disappeared.
what's was the name of that sales manager who gave a statement back in '81?
it was Mickey Thompson, today the proud owner of Steed Motors.
thank you.
you boys let me know when the Philly PD is ready to upgrade.
I'll get you into something with real punch.
new Charger, 0 to 60 in five seconds.
volume deal, below invoice.
brass gets the new cars.
we drive the beaters till the wheels fall off.
personally, I prefer the American classics like the '73 Eldorado we found Donna D'Amico's body in.
that's a shame.
that gal was a real pistol.
you gave a statement: said she left work at 7: 00 that night. - Sounds right.
failed to mention it was in the trunk of the Caddy headed for the salvage yard.
title traced back to this lot when you were sales manager, Mickey.
lot of cars come through, guys.
the beaters come in one door and out the next. Sold off for parts.
but before or after you stripped the VIN number?
Hey, hold your horses.
now, who's the owner that traded that car in?
no, I don't remember the car, but I remember him.
repeat customer. One of Bruce's clients.
must have taken the Caddy off trade.
lot of cash slipped away on used cars back then.
saying this guy dumped the Caddy?
well, if it was a clunker, he could have had it stripped for parts and sent to salvage.
and this Bruce had a problem with Donna?
not when she was getting him coffee.
Donna was a go-getter.
Hey, you want to play with the boys, you gotta roll with the punches.
yo, Donna.
I just talked to the Tower.
he sees you've been working your tail off.
I told him you could have the next up.
come on. Mickey went for that?
yo, Mickey.
Yeah, give it to the green pea.
guy's looking for his daughter.
I sold him a car two years ago.
he's a whale.
I thought Sanil had next up.
Sanil couldn't close a door with two hands and an arm.
look, you work this right, this could be worth a pound or maybe two.
I know everything about that car, inside out.
get him on the hook.
you tell him to follow you inside. Don't even turn around, all right?
go on. Go make me proud.
Thanks, Bruce.
show time.
come inside?
so the guy wants to know if we'll take a check, full amount.
Damn! I knew that guy was a laydown.
how about that? Didn't even have to get him in the box.
that's gotta be some kind of a record, writing the check on the hood of a car.
don't I still have to get him inside?
sign paperwork?
Yeah, why don't you get him to wallpaper the showroom with his checks while you're at it?
I thought Bruce sold him a car.
every schmuck on the lot sold that flake a car.
every month for the past five years.
what are you guys talking about?
the guys a major hoople. He just likes talking to car salesmen.
Oh, you think that's funny, Bruce?
Oh, you can't handle it, why don't you go back inside and answer the phone, sweetheart?
all right.
I think I'll call your wife first, tell her about all the female customers you've been test-driving, huh?
you wouldn't dare. - Wouldn't I?
salesman should never mess where he eats.
especially with the lady who transfers his calls.
Bruce and Donna had a thing?
thing or fling. Bruce was a dog.
he always had women calling the office.
Donna ever get to tell on his wife?
all I know is that he took two weeks after she disappeared.
Bruce was a closer. He never took a vacation.
you never told the cops?
he was still married. And at the time, my top salesman.
is he still selling cars?
last I heard, up the street.
german luxury sedans, so screw him.
excuse me.
do you have an appointment?
don't need one, Bruce.
excuse me.
I thought you were customers.
we can tell. - Here about a car.
remember this one?
73 Eldorado?
can't say I do.
you took it as a trade-in from Marshall Brooks back when you worked at Steed Motors.
long time ago. Maybe I did.
we found Donna D'Amico's body stuffed in the trunk.
greeter girl you had a thing with before she disappeared?
I knew Donna. But we definitely didn't have a thing.
your old boss, Mickey, says different.
then he's mistaken.
he's also a jealous schmuck.
nothing more than a piker.
you can tell him I said that.
told us you were the last one to handle that Cadillac.
that's a crock. Look, I sold cars.
I didn't process trade-ins.
and I had no problem with Donna.
way we heard it, she screwed up your marriage pretty good.
I screwed up my marriage.
all four of 'em. Didn't need any help with that.
truth is, I tried to help Donna.
nobody was moving American back then; gas prices, the economy in the toilet.
but she saw something none of the other jokers on the line did.
come on. The guy's a tire-kicker. Look at him.
What?'Cause he's a Puerto Rican?
he won't even come inside.
he hates all the new models.
deadbeat. Yeah, it's a waste of time.
well, get rid of him before Mickey sees.
he's on the warpath today.
just let the parts manager go this morning.
your kidding. Why?
because the parts keep disappearing, that's why.
blaming him for the break-in last month?
Hey, just get the chiseler off the lot, all right?
Mickey called.
actually, Donna, you're up.
for real.
Mickey said you can't do any worse than Sanil.
this is no place for a lady.
you like that car, sir?
I don't know about these K-cars.
it's a lot of money for all that plastic.
what's this leatherette thing?
I can't say that I blame you.
let me show you something else.
cause I see, I,myself,
I prefer a car with a little more meat on its bones, you know what I mean?
this is a used car. - And it's priced right.
I mean, forget those little four-bangers.
what I like is a big V-8.
some real power under the hood.
it's a big car.
you look like the kind of man that can handle it.
I mean, look at these lines.
that is real leather inside.
power everything.
curves and chrome.
I mean, I think I lost my virginity in the back of one of these babies, you know?
I'm Donna.
you want to talk price?
follow me.
she sold that sled for a pound over Blue Book.
nobody was moving the used stuff back then.
and she was smart.
those American cars are classics now.
nothing after 1980 is.
that break-in you mentioned.
anybody ever find out who did it? - Nope.
cops interviewed everybody. - Inside job?
that car lot, everybody was working some kind of scam.
I dug up the old burglary report.
the break-in happened a month prior to Donna's disappearance.
they killed the guard dogs?
Yeah. Threw poisoned meat over the fence.
stole two-grand-worth of parts.
insurance cover it? - Yeah.
the lock on the gate wasn't even broken.
trying to track down the insurance investigator.
inside job, Donna could have got caught up in the mix somehow.
well, whoever did it had to know where to flip stolen auto parts.
the salesman, Oscar Anderson, called in the burglary.
and was questioned extensively.
well, history's about to repeat itself.
qd recovered the address on the Lester receipt in Donna's jacket.
receipt?
a business address? - 482 Ridge Avenue.
today, it's a Wawa. But back in '81, it was a Goodwill.
Marisa D'Amico came by, dropped that off.
said you asked for it.
personal effects from her mother.
I guess she thinks about her more than she let on.
is attend a brief presentation upon your arrival at our Las Vegas resort.
thank you.
Bye-bye.
once a salesman, always a salesman, huh, Oscar?
Oh, I just do this to keep me young.
there's nothing quite like the rush from a good sale.
you remember Donna D'Amico?
I remember the day the police came, said she'd gone missing.
Yup.
left that little girl behind.
it's just awful. - You see her the night before?
no, I had a big day on the board.
took the boys out for drinks.
there was a burglary earlier that month. You called it in?
I was first one on the lot. Had to prep a car for a customer.
you think Donna was involved? - Do you?
well, I know people were desperate.
you see, after the oil crisis, we were selling an inferior product.
hell, the government had to bail out Chrysler.
what does that got to do with Donna?
a lot of guys were struggling just to feed their families, and then Mickey lets this lady start selling cars.
created some resentment.
the day she went on the board, the timing could not have been worse.
gotta squeeze more out of every deal.
get 'em in the box.
work the four square: Price, down payment, monthly, trade-in.
and you hammer away.
start high, you wear 'em down.
you confuse them!
when they're ready to give up, you call in a closer.
it's not working, Mickey.
they don't like the cars. - What'd you say?
he means they can't trust us when they don't trust the product.
I-I took a guy on a test drive.
I cranked up the window, and the handle broke.
you want to sell? They you do whatever it takes!
cold canvass!
work the phones!
no shown appointments, no more ups.
I'm trying, Mickey. - No.
no, what you're doing is that you're failing, my friend, okay?!
I mean, the coffee girl could sell cars better than you!
Ah, because you let her take my last up!
I didn't take anything. - Shut your mouth, woman.
haven't you done enough already?
I only closed that deal 'cause you couldn't.
you couldn't close a window, Hoover.
I've carried you long enough. You know what?
why don't you, why don't you try selling vacuum cleaners?
Mickey, Mickey... please...
I need this job.
now you need a new one.
why are you still here?
go on, hit the bricks.
I told her not to worry.
it wasn't her fault.
but Sanil felt otherwise? - I guess I never thought he'd hurt her.
so Donna got promoted, Sanil got canned.
it's either in the blood or it's not.
some guys just can't close.
1979-- I came here with nothing.
tried to sell cars to make a living.
chrysler. - Perfect timing.
nobody wanted to buy American anymore.
specially from me.
Donna D'Amico sold cars.
I understand you had a big problem with that.
it wasn't personal.
we were all struggling. I realize that now.
you were humiliated.
they fired you and you blamed her.
no, I went to night school to learn computers.
programming. 1981...
now, that was perfect timing.
you ever see Donna again after they let you go?
day when I came back to get my last check.
I hated that place.
you didn't bleed the customer dry, somebody else would do it for you.
DEsteban, what are you doing here?
I can't afford the car you sold me.
what do you mean? We went over the numbers; it's a good deal.
but then they called me to come back in.
told me there was a problem with my trade-in.- Problem?
the man said it was worth less than what you told me.
that I owe more money.
who called you? The finance department?
with this loan, I can afford to make my payments and make rent.
please, por favor, could you do something?
Yeah, just, uh...
just give me a minute, okay?
what is this, Frank?
uh, floor mats, dealer prep fee... 24% on his loan...
Hey, I did my job.
Mickey, come on, you got to do something for this guy.
the bank's gonna repo his car that he needs to get to his job and it's going to wreck his credit.
you, uh... you sign for this?
that your name right there?
you, uh, looking for a good buy, huh?
well... "good-bye." You own it, buddy.
welcome to America.
if they didn't get you on the front end, F&I got you on the way out.
Donna told him she would never send a customer in to him blind again.
big profits on used cars.
so Donna started cutting Frank out of the loop?
sure, he figured it out.
I could think of a lot of names for Frank.
but "stupid" isn't one of them.
Donna's compact, baby bracelet from the hospital, phone bills.
it looks like the grandmother swept it into a box after Donna disappeared.
kind of sad.
all she has left of her mom.
Christmas card from the dealership.
doesn't say who sent it, but the address is handwritten.
nothing else with the name Lester.
are Donna's keys in there?
there's uh... grandmother's apartment, car...
and then there's this one.
kind of looks like it fits one of those old steamer trunks.
finally found your Lester.
thanks for bringing that stuff in.
I'm sorry. It's all I had.
your grandmother by any chance own a piano, Marisa?
a piano?
no. Why?
this is a key to a piano.
the one your mother put a down payment on the day before she was murdered.
I don't get it.
a Lester piano.
the ason your mom cleaned out her bank account.
she bought a piano?
she said we didn't have any room for it.
she was looking for a new place.
I remember her telling me that.
I just wanted it to be true.
let's do it again.
we can't, boo.
I have to be at work.
I want a piano-- a real one-- to play at home.
well, maybe someday, when we find a place for it.
grandma doesn't have enough space.
and that is another reason why Mommy has to go to work now.
I don't like it when you got to work.
I don't either, you know, but everybody's got a job they got to do.
do you like your job, Mommy?
I like that I found something that I'm good at.
you know, it's real important in life that you find something that you're good at.
she always had to go away.
I used to think she went to work...
to get away from me.
I know what it's like to have a parent walk out on you as a kid, Marisa.
but that's not what your mother did.
now, I'm going to find out whoever took her away from you.
I was in mortgages until the sub prime thing blew up.
never thought I'd find another business that would tank as bad as American cars, but I did.
cars, caskets-- still dinging them on the way out, huh, Frank?
your line of work-- Should the bereaved ever need a referral.
you were the numbers guy at Steed Motors back in the '80s?
the numbers stunk. That's why I got out.
see, and we thought it was 'cause of that burglary in '81.
you saying I robbed the place?
well, probably made the boss money on that insurance claim-- win-win.
Donna figure it out, too?
all those calls of yours she transferred?
that what this is about-- Donna D'Amico?
she cut you out. Kept you from screwing the customers on the back end.
she didn't get it.
customers have all the power.
they can leave any time.
our job was no different than yours. - Come again?
get 'em in the box, get as much as you can, get 'em to sign before they walk out the door.
I look like a salesman to you, Frank?
you do what you have to do.
befriend, persuade, control, lie.
but once they sign, they're going to pay for it for years.
Donna got it, Frank.
she just did it her way.
it just turned out to be bad for your business.
Donna figured out how the real money was made on the lot.
and that put her in direct conflict with someone a lot more dangerous than me.
who the hell do you think you are?
telling customers not to buy add-ons or financing.
why, so you can rape my customers on the back end, Frank?
frank: You don't know when to quit.
Hey, she's right, Frank.
all you young sharks are destroying our business.
you rip a customer's head off on a deal, they never come back.
stay out of this, Oscar.
kills all our referrals, all our repeat business.
you don't sell a man one car.
you sell him a dozen cars over a lifetime.
that's a profession, damn it.
go blow a sale, you old bag of wind.
why would I help you, Frank?
you're selling cars out from under me.
what are you talking about?
I had a guy on the hook the other day, selling a '72 Chevelle-- only to find out it had already been sold.
that wasn't my call. That car was promised to the wholesaler.
for a song. I know the Blue Book on that car.
I could have sold it for twice that.
talk to the Tower.
who, Mickey?
why would we dump a good car for that much less?
if you know what's good for you, lady, you talk to your boss before selling another used car.
Donna figured out the sales manager was giving the best trade-ins to the wholesaler for peanuts.
Mickey? Why would he do that?
kickbacks. He was lining his pockets.
screwing over the dealership owner, and Donna knew it.
but you signed her timecard.
said Donna left at 7: 00 that night.
Mickey had me do that for everybody.
I closed a deal that night.
she was there at least till 10: 00.
he had you take care of that old Cadillac too, Frank?
me? No.
Mickey decided what happened to every trade-in.
whether it went to the lot, wholesaler... or the salvage yard.
got me in the box, Detective? - Yep.
well, I've done this to thousands of customers.
unlike those schmucks, I know I can walk anytime.
Yeah, you made quite a ving ripping people off.
people always think they're getting ripped off.
look, you're trying to get the best deal-- I'm trying to make a living.
I just don't like to lose.
talking about you ripping off your boss-- the dealership owner.
stole so much you became one yourself. - Bunch of twaddle.
the smart owner knows every guy on the lot is working some kind of scam.
too bad Donna figured out your big used car scam.
she didn't leave at 7: 00 like you said.
she stuck around to confront you.
you got nothing.- One of your old lackeys clued us in as to how you worked the break-in, the inside job, insurance fraud.
sounds like I need better lackeys.
willing to testify that you sent that '73 Caddy to the salvage yard.
with Donna's body in the trunk.
the only thing we care about here is the homicide, Mick.
who told you this nonsense?
let's see... the price for homicide is life.
plus fees, which...
you'll be paying on the inside.
now your down payment so far, is zero.
what do you want your monthly payment to be?
unless of course, you're offering a trade-in?
do you have anything to trade, Mick?
except a bunch of bull?
see... I'm willing to go to bat for you here, but you gotta give something up.
you got to...
you got to meet me in the middle. My boss...
he's gonna hammer me on this one.
so this is your best offer.
I don't think it's gonna get this deal done.
I liked Donna.
gotta hand it to her. She was a hell of a salesman...
in some ways, too good.
at selling cars? - Used cars.
she had an eye for it, she knew what a car was really worth.
like the ones you sent back to the wholesalers for kickbacks?
couldn't let her kill the golden goose.
so I offered her a deal...
I know what you're doing, Mickey.
you know just enough to get yourself in trouble.
close the door.
me? You're the one stealing this place blind.
you're screwing over the owner.
the owner thinks I'm a hero 'cause I make him a lot of money.
you?
well, he doesn't even know your name, sweetheart.
all I wanted was a chance to sell, you know.
a chance to prove myself.
Yeah, yeah, and you got that.
thanks to me.
Congratulations.
you got your bonus.
fair and square.
tops on the board, profit-wise.
and there's plenty more where that came from.
you know, Oscar was right.
we keep doing business like this, and there ain't gonna be any business left.
Oscar? Why you listening to Oscar for?
he hasn't sold a car in months. - What do you mean?
I thought you took him off the board to handle fleet sales.
Oscar couldn't handle a yard sale.
would of fired him a long time ago, but I felt bad for the old guy.
let him wash cars to earn his keep around here.
I earned this.
for me and for 'Riss. - Sure, kid.
Yeah.
but in the future?
you check with me before you sell a trade-in...
never came back.
thought she took the money and ran.
tell me about this Oscar, the has-been.
tough racket, selling cars. Game just passed him by.
was he there the night that Donna disappeared?
every night.
he had a lot of cars to wash.
even let the old guy lock up.
the pulled DMV records on an Oscar Anderson.
found his name registered to a 1971 Cadillac Eldorado.
71?
Donna's body was found in the trunk of a '73, Right, a salvage yard beater.
but the models share a lot of the same parts, and those require upkeep.
you know, seats, wheels, bumpers, you name it.
it's possible Oscar was taking parts off the beater for a '71 Caddy.
Yeah. Didn't know he was going to need it that night to hide a body.
power locks, power steering, power roof.
it's a car ahead of its time.
won it back in '71.
top man on the board.
nine out of 12 months.
a real classic. - Oh, yeah.
bet you Donna could appreciate a car like this.
she turned out to be a pretty shrewd salesgal.
got to admit that.
kind of a shame how it ended for you there, Oscar.
at the dealership.
Oh, I had my cold spells.
but I'll tell you this-- when I was on a roll, there was nobody hotter.
Mickey told us you hadn't sold a car in months.
you lied to us, Oscar. - Said you were out celebrating some sale.
boozing with the boys the night Donna disappeared.
well, that's ridiculous.
I don't remember if it was that exact night.
you should,'cause you were there on the lot.
out back washing cars.
you were the next Hoover.
one step away from hawking vacuum cleaners.
magazines, telemarketing... - Now wait just a damn minute.
I had a run of bad luck is all.
but my customers always came back.
you were done, Oscar. Doing chores for Mickey.
locking up, taking the beaters to salvage.
like that '73 Caddy.
and when you stripped the VIN number off, probably some parts, too.
71 never had an egg-crate style grill.
it's 'cause it's from a '73.
Oh, come on.
we take this car apart we going to find more parts from that '73?
you can't do that. - You got careless, Oscar.
you dumped the body, but you took the parts.
stole her money, and left her to rot in that junkyard.
but, hey, you sent Donna's family a Christmas card.
Marisa saved it. It's got your handwriting on it.
but you really think that would make up for killing her mother?
I didn't kill that woman.
and I did not steal her bonus.
what bonus, Oscar?
how'd you know she got a bonus, Oscar?
you just told me. - No, we said you took her money.
now how'd you know about the bonus she got that night?
now hold on a minute. Just wait a second.
I'm trying to explain.
I... I want to...I'm trying to.
it wasn't me that changed.
you know, it...
...it was the business.
you give me a quality car, bet your ass, I could still close 'em.
sure you could.
we can work something out here, right?
we... we can work something out?
Yeah, we can work something out.
just a spell of bad luck, that's all it was.
if I could have just broken through...
I'd have been right back on top of that board.
Hey, Oscar.
Oh, hey, Donna.
just prepping a car for an appointment tomorrow.
it's good to see you still get repeat business.
well, it's the only way.
you build a reputation, it's about repeats and referrals.
matter of time, I'm back on a roll bucking for that bonus.
Hey, who won it this time, by the way?
I sold another car today, Oscar.
I got the bonus.
what? Really? - Yeah.
I... That's great, kid!
Congratulations!
Yeah.
so how'd you close that baby?
you know, I just knew what the guy wanted.
and I let the sale come to me.
like you say.
get a real charge out of it, too.
Oh, don't I know it.
that feeling never gets old.
you see this car here-- came on the lot today?
Yeah, the Impala. - Yeah.
back in '72, I must have sold 20 of these babies the minute they hit the lot.
still a good car.
people just don't, uh... hold on to them anymore.
Harold Bloom. Look at that.
Yeah, that's his trade-in.
that's the guy I sold the car to today.
I know Harold.
I sold him this car.
you sold him this car?
this Impala? - Harold's my client!
you know what I had to do to make this sale?
look, he just came in. He didn't ask for you.
why the hell not?! - I don't know.
look, I feel terrible.
I am so sorry.
I'll split the commission with you.
I don't want your charity!
you know, it's just not right.
it's not how you do business.
I feel horrible.
you don't have to do this.
do what?
you don't have to wash cars for Mickey, you know, you could do something else.
how dare you?
you know, I'm not some vacuum cleaner salesman.
who do you think you're talking to?!
I was selling cars when you were in diapers.
I have been a closer since before you were born!
chances are, they have a loved one fighting in Southeast Asia.
our boys are doing everything to keep their souls intact over there.
so ask yourself: what are you doing over here?
when you look in the mirror, does the reflection seek material gain from the world?
I wasn't finished.
sorry, Dad. Sorry.
he ain't bad.
kid can really play "Son of a Preacher Man.
what does it profit a man to gain the whole world...
...and lose his soul?
so, Archie, you said your pop was William Sanders, right?
william Jeremiah Sanders. What it says on my birth certificate.
and my mom Beatrice passed away six months ago.
just always told me he was a drunken bum.
so, why the sudden interest?
my kid came home the other day and asked me to help him with this.
reminded me of when I had the same project back in school.
now my son's asking about my dad.
and you couldn't tell him anything.
just want to maybe find out something about him.
you know, fill in the blanks.
so your mom told you he was murdered? - No, no.
old Philly Tribune had a blurb about a Billy Sanders killed in 1970, eight months before I was born.
tracked this down from the Ident Unit.
looks like you.
mug shot, huh?
guess Ma was right.
what was he arrested for?
disorderly conduct outside a bar. Just the one time. Could happen to anybody.
paper said he was killed down on Wharton Street, 1500 block.
any idea what he was doing down there?
see the calluses?
perfectly manicured nails. - Your pop a musician?
don't know. - Your mother ever mention anyone else, - Dad's side of the family? - Nothing. That's why I'm here, Detective.
when you find anything...
sure. Um...
we'll let you know.
well, the dad was a reverend. Billy played the organ at his church.
only people interviewed were, uh, friends, family from the congregation.
what's a church boy doing hanging down on Wharton Street Friday night?
think I know.
ain't seen one of these for 30 years.
you got to get out more, Will.
check out the bee in the middle.
VIP pass to The Hive. After-hours jazz spot back in the day, just a block from where Billy was killed.
he would have been a regular.
were you a card carrying member, too?
I wish.
you had a Jack of Clubs, you weren't some drunken bum, like Mom said.
anything to get out of these COMPSTAT reports. What you got?
jazz musician, 20 years old. Blunt-force trauma.
no wallet on the body. ID'd from a disorderly conduct pinch in '70.
wharton section of South Philly. Heavy streetwalker traffic.
well, assigned thought it could have been the old flimflam.
a trick gets lured in. - Pimp cracks his skull, takes his cash.
murder weapon looks like a bottle.
found dark glass shattered near the victim.
M. E. assessed it matched the wound to his skull.
there's a state liquor store a block over from where he was killed.
so was The Hive, an underground club where Billy played.
will was the after-hours guru back in the day.
could only go a couple times before I got drafted.
ran every Friday, same night Billy was killed.
I heard of this place. It was in the basement of some house, right?
Yeah. Joint was hot, smelly, crowded.
but the music... Man.
what I would have given to have a Jack of Clubs.
long shot, but let's check out the bottle, see if we can track where it might have come from.
what about next of kin? - Reverend Thomas Sanders.
never mentioned his son played the clubs back in the day.
you remember any of the musicians from that place, Will?
not by name. Owner was a tough broad, the Queen Bee.
she'd sit at the end of the bar, smoke like a chimney.
maybe she's still buzzing around, can tell us if Billy was there night he died.
talk to Dad, too. See if any of this new info sparks a memory.
got a kid here, wants to see Detective Rush.
I'm her partner. I'll talk to him.
he asked for Detective Rush.
Ooh. Something I ate.
the chili fries?
good, though. - Valens.
Hey, Ma.
uh, just...No reason. Just checking in.
what, I can't check on my mom?
Yeah, fine. Okay, yeah. Talk later. Bye.
ran the title. Real estate files show the Queen Bee was Geraldine Watkins back in '70.
still around?
Yeah. Runs a soul food joint out of the same address today.
somebody here to see me?
Oh, yeah. He's right over...
we played music for the Lord.
Billy played an organ the angels envied.
is that Billy's brother?
Tom Jr. was going to be a preacher in the Sanders tradition.
my eldest was taken by the jungle, my youngest, by the streets.
both jungles, just different terrain.
I served over there, as well.
you got something on my son's murder?
we're looking into it.
was there anyone at church had a problem with Billy?
on the contrary. When he died, they buried him like a king.
his casket, his headstone, the flowers-- all courtesy of the congregation.
any chance we can get a list of the congregation members back then?
I'll check and see. But why?
Tom, you familiar with The Hive?
after-hours jazz club back in the day?
why would I be? I don't associate with those kinds of people.
ever mention a girl named Beatrice Sloan?
what are you implying about my son, Detective?
nothing. Just trying to find out what happened.
well, when his brother died, it was rough on everyone.
me and Billy drifted apart a bit.
he in some kind of trouble? Drugs, money?
no, no. Not that I knew of.
I just think he may have started to question his faith.
know anyone he was hanging with outside the church before he died?
I'm sorry. I don't.
but may the weight of the Lord be on their soul.
check out the "specials...
winning numbers on the track today.
street lottery. Little numbers running with your soul food?
Hey, sweeties.
anywhere you'd like.
creamed chicken is to die for. - Looks like a winner.
got to say, Queen Bee, step up from The Hive.
honey, I'm an honest business woman.
call Vice over, they going to agree?
the Hive ain't been around since the '70s.
well, there's no statute of limitation on homicide.
homicide?
Oh, Sanders. Yeah.
sad, 'cause he was a nice kid.
had this on him.
he here the night he died? - Not that I remember.
we're going to need the names of who might have been here that night.
if any of them are still alive.
all those musician cats wanted to be like Miles.
they came with a nasty habit.
any of those cats have a beef with Billy?
no. Church boy? Not at all.
seems like a tight fit for a jazz club.
they didn't mind. I had to turn folks away.
shucks. Tons of musicians used to roll through here, but even I was shocked the night Billy Sanders appeared on my stage.
where did you learn to beat like that, kid?
come on, now. Time to get paid.
uh-uh, gentlemen. The Bank of Geraldine doesn't give money away.
you drank more than you played.
no. Not tonight.
don't work like that.
Hey, Miss Watkins. - Billy?
I'm gonna see you and your mom at church on Sunday, right?
now, beat it.
your father know you're here, Billy?
no, and I'd appreciate if we kept it that way.
sorry to hear about your brother, sweetie.
Oh, I didn't order anything.
be careful, young man.
thanks for the drink... miss.
my mother's the only "miss" in my family.
can really play those drums. - Play a lot more than that.
Really? - Yeah, learn by ear.
if- if I hear it, I can play it.
so you can hold a beat, but you can't hold your liquor?
well, well, I'm a quick learner.
one more coming up.
who was the girl?
Beatrice something.
older, but wise to the fact that drummers keep the rhythm.
Beatrice Sloan? - That's it.
Yeah, used to work for Ronde Brooks.
Ronde Brooks? Of Ronde Records?
one and the same.
but I always thought that Beatrice was Ronde's girl.
Ronde know about her and Billy?
you gotta ask him.
don't let the suit fool you, 'cause Ronde came up in the streets, and you don't get to what he had by getting chumped.
can I get you guys anything? Perrier?
I'm good.
I own every single one of these on vinyl. - No kidding.
you know, I've got a lifetime achievement ceremony in my honor coming up.
I could put aside a couple of tickets.
Thanks, but we're tied up with Billy Sanders' murder.
Yeah, I remember Billy Sanders. Session guy.
you must've been pissed when you heard he was steppin' out with Beatrice, knocked her up.
guys, I don't-- I don't date my secretaries.
Yeah, nobody with money does that.
Beatrice would go around to the clubs and let me know which musicians to look at.
Billy was one of them.
you and Billy get along? - Sure. Yeah, we got along.
he had a very strict old man, though.
you know, when Billy wasn't churchin', he was workin' for me.
but he asked me to pay him under the table.
he wanted to keep it quiet. - So, why didn't you come forward, make a statement after he was killed?
I didn't even hear about it until a week later. Kid quit coming around.
Why's that? - Why do most of 'em?
he fell to the bottle or the needle.
the one thing I will say about Billy, kid was all about the right place, the right time.
hold it.
yo, what's that?
you guys deaf? Answer me.
I was playing behind the beat.
sounded kinda fresh, you know.
damn it, kid!
ronde, I- I'm sorry, man.
I told him to stay on the beat.
stop, stop. What he's rollin' with sounds good.
it's your drunk ass that's always trippin' us up, punchy.
hit the road. Beat it. Go sleep it off.
you kiddin' me, man.
looks like I'm kiddin'?
you, jump in.
somebody come play bass. Behind the beat, like him.
and with an ear like mine, some things just stick out to you.
so, who was the mess? - That would be Buster Large.
soon after graduated to train wreck.
you fire him? - Eventually had to.
after Billy leapfrogged him, the fellas gave him hell.
he crawled deep into the bottle, junk.
he blame Billy for his troubles?
ain't that what most addicts do?
excuse me, detectives.
so, Buster follows Billy home from The Hive, bottle in hand.
cracks him over the head, takes him out.
most expensive bottle of booze Buster ever bought in his life.
bet you wish all our vics were musicians.
freakin' kid in a candy store.
no candy store I went to had the O'Jays on vinyl.
lot to choose from. You, uh, got any Spinners?
Philly Soul's over there, on wax.
buster, right?
session guy over at Ronde Records back when.
Yeah. There was some other kid behind you on bass, Billy Sanders?
you guys cops?
well, we're not here to sell insurance. You still hittin' the sauce, Buster?
been clean 30 years. - It's all good, but Billy was killed in 1970.
I got along with Billy just fine.
Really? Was that before or after he made you the laughingstock of the Swamp-pit?
Billy wanted that gig, he could have it.
Ronde was a slave driver, anyway.
feel the same way when you were poutin' outside the studio after you got canned?
looking for your job back? - Look, hell, yeah, I got pissed.
but I realized that Billy was just better than me.
it was in his soul.
and he knew what sounded good.
Hey, why don't you ever bring me no drink, Beatrice?
why don't you ever pass one up?
Hey, baby. - Hey, baby.
there's a girl here in her Sunday best.
she says she's from your church.
so, I was thinkin', um, maybe I could come by your place later.
that- that's probably not a good idea.
look, come on, he catches me here, he'll skin my hide, let alone bring you home.
Why's he so against you bein' here?
told you, it's the way it is
and it's not what my brother would've done.
how do I look?
you look great.
come on, don't be nervous. Relax.
ronde, this here's Chandra, the one I was telling you about.
got those gospel pipes.
not now.
uh, but you said you'd hear my friend sing...
can't you see I'm busy?
gotta get these sounds right.
Yeah, well, you know, you ain't never gonna get it right if you keep copying Motown.
what, what did you say?
your vocalists got no soul, no pain. Motown's got gospel.
screw Motown, all right? This is Philly.
then let's actually tap into the Philly sound.
falsetto from the street corners we hear every day - - let's show that to the world.
what you know 'bout makin' records, huh?
I know this mono stuff is junk.
we need something fresh-- a fuller sound than Motown has ever imagined, strings and horns, all on different tracks.
what are we, The Beatles?
why not? They it stole from us, let's steal it back.
Okay,how 'bout this, kid? As soon as you can pay for it, we'll do it.
deal?
so then you'll listen to my friend? - You crazy?
she ain't a front girl. She just a churchy with a fat ol' ass.
that's the last I saw of him.
but the thing is, he called it. Wasn't long before Gamble & Huff took it to a whole new level.
