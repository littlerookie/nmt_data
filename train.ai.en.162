elop discussed ice hockey-close to both canadian and finnish hearts-and even jested about finnish licorice candy he didn't like.
elop holds the distinction of being the first nokia (nok) ceo who was not born in finland.
elop needs to deliver results after shifting strategy at nokia, and a ceo making massive layoffs like logue needs to actually turn the company around.

elop said nokia (nok) was like a person standing on a burning platform and would have to jump into icy water to save itself.
elop took the reins at nokia in september 2010, a tumultuous time for the mobile phone giant as it lost smartphone market share to apple's (aapl, fortune 500) iphone and a variety of android-powered phones.
elop was partially right.
elop's tenure at nokia has been controversial, but unlike insiders he had the ability to divorce the company from symbian and make a much-needed bet on a more viable operating system (albeit not a very popular one).
