grace, but your dad's a total bell end.
I want you to think a way out of the predicament, Richard.
this is your moment to show me what you're made of.
hmm.
promise me, Rich.
I promise.
cool, get in here.
what... now?!
I'm horny, aren't you?
fuck it, yes.
come on, hurry up.
all right, all right.
get in here.
all right. All right.
Oh, shit... sorry.
Ow!
stupid fucking jeans.
mind my catheter.
shit, sorry.
Whoops!
what?
fuck off! Fuck off!
fucking come on, then.
what about my...
fuckers!

Richard!
sweetie!
Richypoo!
what?
surprise! We got you a ticket!
you're coming to Halkidiki with us!
I fucking well am not.
Richard!
Anita!
mr Blood called again today.
I know you're worried about Grace, poppet. We all are.
how much have I spent on flowers in the last two weeks?
11. 49.
11. 49, poppet.
but you can't keep doing this to that poor family.
give them some space, Rich.
a holiday will do you the world of good.
and you'll make lots of new friends.
we met some lovely young girls banana-boating last year.
yeah? I'd rather hang myself.
Kevin, unpack the bags.
Anita, I'm sure he didn't mean...
I said unpack the effing bags!
every single warning sign Take A Break said to look out for, but you wouldn't listen!
I will not come home to my baby swinging from the rafters!
mum, I'm not going to actually...
we will fix you, poppet.
I know it hurts. Of course it does but you'll move on.
it's just young love.
it's not real.
mum, I'm fine. She needs me here.
if Blood wants me to stay away, I'll stay away.
but I'm not leaving. OK?
if she's not on that flight in four hours,
I'm actually going to be forced to kill myself.
are we clear, Kevin?
# Another rose wilts in East Harlem # And uptown, downtown # A thousand miles between us # She's waiting for the night to fall # Let it fall # I'll never make it in time... #
mr Blood?
I've been thinking and, er... you're right... about everything.
whatever you want for her, whatever you want me to be, I'll be.
just don't take her away, all right?
mr Blood?
your milk is no longer required here. Professor Blood.
No!
no fucking signal! Fuck!
fuck!
# I'm walking on sunshine, whoa!
# I'm walking on sunshine, whoa!
# And don't it feel good... #
# You'll take me home tonight # We both know that # You hold my arm firmly # And say, "Oh, please don't leave
# Don't you worry cos I'm staying here # Don't you worry cos I'm not leaving # Don't you worry cos I'll stay here with you... #
don't worry, I'm here.
# I'll stay here with you, with you # You say, "It's time to leave
# It's getting dark # Feet moving on their own # We trust they'll take us home # Don't you worry cos I'm staying here # Don't you worry...
# ... cos I'm not leaving # Don't you worry cos I'll staying with you... #
rich! Come on, Rich?
come on, Rich!
Richard!

OK. You have some uses.

Yeah, yeah, go, go.

it's like a paddling pool got punctured or something.
Oh, cheers.
you know what? Fuck the both of you.
er... Rich, why didn't you...
why didn't you call me?
what, she wakes up and you just don't bother to let me know?
I lost my phone.
I'm her best friend.
well, I'm sorry.
I see you managed to fill the emptiness inside, though.
I wanted a fuck. He's available.
Yeah. But you like me, right?
long as you don't talk, yeah, it's all right.
but this is a secret, right?
min, I don't give a fuck.
why don't you just wipe yourself down and then piss off?
that's my phone.
shut it.
fuck.
I, er... I need some closure here.
Yeah, go on, then.
rich?
Oh, thank Christ!
I tried to ring you.
I know. Er... when...
when are you coming home, Grace?
because I really need you, OK?
rich, I haven't got long. They're moving me again.
dad won't tell me where.
your fucking dad wants to split us up.
run away.
it's not that simple.
it is! Just run away and I'll...
he's my dad, Rich.
meet you in Paris, OK?
I can't. Shit, it's him.

Oh, fuck me. Fuck! Fucking hell.
Ah! Ah! Fucking hell, yeah!
Ah! Ah!
Ah, fuck! Fuck! Ah!
No!

Oi!

Why? This could be the gig of the century!
rich...
Richard, you give me back my amp! Rich!
that's nice. That's really fucking nice, isn't it?
touch my kit, Rich, and you'll get this one down your throat and this one up your arse.
everything I do for you and you fuck it back at me.
I fetched your gear for you.
I don't want you to fetch my gear!
I want you to fetch my girlfriend!
don't you get it, man?
if she wanted to be here, she would be here!
No! She's dumped you, mate!
all right, actually, no... she got her dad to do it for her.
maybe that is a bit pussy, but now we're going to party like it's 1999
and get the fuck over it!
Rich...You fuck off!
no, you dildo. Get off! Rich, fuck off!
O'malley, What are you doing?
you two look so fucking lame,
I'm giving it a sheen of responsibility.
well, don't, all right?
rich, get off!
you think being in this stupid band is going to help?
music doesn't solve anything!
Yes, it does.
that's what you've told me all my life.
this is the music revolution.
music revolution
you are first against the wall, O'Malley!
I was trying to help you.
I am always trying to help you.
why bother?
because I'm your mate.
yeah? You sure you don't want to be in the band so Mini can let you look her in the eye when you suck her cock?
can you just keep it down, yeah?
she still here?
Yeah. She doesn't want anyone to know.
do you want to know why Mini doesn't want anyone to know?
it's cause she'll fuck anything and you're anything.
you're a fucking joke.
mate...
Oh, fuck!
Oh, mother fucker!
you give up poking Yoko Ono and we'll start the music revolution together.
me and you.
don't ask me to do that, man.
I might never see breasts like that again.
I mean, they are magnificent.
rich!
not the axe, Rich.
rich, don't throw away the dream!
you dick.
take your piece of shit axe, your piece of shit amp and put it in your piece of shit van and fuck off!
let me get this straight...
you broke in to your college principal's house, started living there and wearing his clothes?
alo started it.
Jesus Christ!
why haven't you rung me?
huh?
I've been going off my nut cause my best friend's been in a coma for four weeks and nobody could be arsed to ring me, tell me she woke up and left the fucking country.
I thought Mini would have told you.
mini knows about this?! What the fuck...
she can't pick up the phone?
maybe her mouth's too full.
What?!
nothing.
everything's mental since fucking Morocco.
can't we take her dad to court or something?
I don't think it works like that.
what the fuck is wrong with you?
I thought you were metal.
Yeah, I thought I was, too.
you're not the only one who misses her, you know?
what the fuck has happened to us all?
where are my friends?
I-I'll get you some biscuits.
Oi, mate, can we get some biscuits here, please?
I do actually feel a little better.
you said you'd meet her in Paris, right?
I didn't get round to where to meet.
her dad came in.
ring the stupid clinic again.
they won't talk to us.
how hard can it be to find someone in Paris?
in the whole of Paris?
pretty hard.
not sounding very metal again, Rich.
Liv.
here she comes.
Hi.
so, what's so important you couldn't tell me on the phone?
grace woke up.
Oh!
fuck, um...
can we go see her?
how's your French?
Oh, mate, I'm going as fast as I can.
it's all right. You don't have to leave.
no, I think we really should leave.
Why?
according to Facebook, there's about 300 people coming here to watch us play tonight.
cancel it.
see, the thing is, I might have said that there's an empty house in the middle of the countryside and the owners are away, so they're really gonna come and fuck this place up.
good. I hope they burn it down.
right, cock boy, I'm leaving...
Oh...
Hi.
what are you doing here?
you found them, then? Your... straighteners?
Yeah, yeah, I'm really gonna... straighten my hair tonight.

I'm very sad to say...
actually, she died yesterday afternoon.
I just spoke to her.
I speak to her all the time.
me too.
what else is there to do?
she never woke up, did she, from the accident?
that's why we went to Switzerland.
to see if they could wake her up.
I just wanted to try it, you know?
so all this time, she was...?
they said there was nobody left inside.
I thought, what would she think of me for turning off the stupid machine thing?
what would she think?
she'd have thought you're her dad, and that's what you're supposed to do.
she loved me.
and I...
Yes.
that's why I'm here.

I don't need any new friends.

romantic. You might need to get a job first.
I think I'm going to be a stand-Up comedian.
brilliant. Go to sleep now.
Jane, the idea is that you're conscious enough to answer the phone, remember?
I'm sorry, I had a... - Associates' meeting in five. You ready?
I've been looking through the monthly reports - And the one from last night... - Why?
I just have. But, look, look
there's been a mistake.
the monthly figures in the emerging sectors haven't been updated.
see there?
couldn't some of the investors think we're trying to hide something?
I'm sure it's fine. But thank you, you know, for trying.
mark? - Yo.
boys...
er, yeah, so the figures That have come down from upstairs are, erm...
hang on a second. Let me find them.
Yeah, Appendix 16.
er... as you can see, the growth is negative, which we like,
and we're in a position to short it, so...
Yeah, it's good. - Mark, what the fuck is up with you?
er... John McAndrew came in from Miami last night.
he's such a dick. - Well, I ended up out with him,
and stayed out with him and, er...
save it for your wife.
come on, what have you got?
Yeah. Er... basically, we should do it.
great. Any problems in legal?
no. No problem. We're compliant.
great. I think that's it.
Thanks, Mark. That was shit.
but accurate. - Congratulations. Have a cookie.
OK, that's everything.
let's keep the energy up, guys.
end of quarter is fast approaching.
sorry, Jake, just one thing... - What is it?
there's been a fuck-Up with the emerging market numbers.
how do you mean?
they haven't been updated. They don't reflect the returns at all.
has this gone out yet? - No.
fine. Mark?
send that back upstairs, find the fucking author of it, and fire them.
then you get it amended.
we're not running a pissing Ponzi here. - Yeah, got it.
good.
thank you.
get me Chris on the phone, tell him...
what would I do without you? Well done.
can we have coffees in Jake's office, please? Decaf for me.

I quite clearly saw her.

Yeah, Keep your mouth shut.

this is a really nice place. Very... warm.
it's very expensive.

Dominic... Who the fuck are you, Dominic?
I'm a research strategist.
well, fuck me. What is that?
I, er... research stuff...
er... strategically.
I thought you said they were all dicks.
no, I work in a completely different building, so...
are you all right?
Yeah, just a, erm, hysterical dyke, apparently.
is that a thing?
I'm a hormone hypochondriac, doctor said.
attention seeker.
that's right. Takes creative vision. Spliff?
no. We've got stuff to do.
what, right now? - Yep. Come on, Dom.
I've been on my own all day!
what are we doing? - I want to know.

everything.
everything that you know. - Right.
that's a lot. - It's fine.
start from the beginning.
money. Show me.
OK. Yeah.
we could... OK, let's see. We could start with the beginning.
neolithic barter systems.
no. No, no, no, that's too far back.
OK, 18th-Century mutual funds and their bastard children.
derivatives and futures... - OK.
check out the following algorithm...
hang on, slow down.
if you know how to short-Sell... - Yeah, so that means...
say it again...?
do you get it now?

seriously. Thank you so much.
Oh. I... I'm sorry.
Oops. I'm not... I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry. I just, erm...
Dominic. - No, no, no need to worry.
I just... I'm confused, obviously. I... I just...
shout if you're naked! Shout if you're naked! Shout if you're naked!
hm, disappointing.
we're finished.
Ooh. Amazing. Because, erm...
I was actually hoping you might listen to some of my material.
please, please, please?
Naomi wants to be a stand-Up comedian.
Really? Wow, that's cool. That's really cool.
well, thank you! We like him.
I was thinking about moving to London.
what?
no, I've... I've started. This is...
sorry.
anyway, so, London.
supposed to be the city of opportunity, right?
but, actually, only gets you the opportunity to get fucked in the arse.
Oh, my God.
I mean, Boris bikes? They're lovely, aren't they?
thank you, Mr Boris. Thank you, Barclays Bank.
but, those saddles, they're not really for girls, are they?
I mean, I think, every time you sit in one of those saddles,
it's basically like letting Boris finger you.
that's funny. - Really?
Yeah. You're really good.
it's good.
mm, fan-Dabi-Dozi!
Effy! Effy! Effy! - Yes, Jane, that's my name.
I forgot to cancel Victoria's meeting with the fund of fund guys, - And it starts in five minutes. - And you stopped to tell me this why?
Oh, fuck. Yeah, you're right!
run, Jane, run.
good morning, Hewitt Maurice Asset Management...
Yep. Yep, I'll be right down.
she's going to fire me, isn't she? - Probably.
I'll do it.
thank you! Thank you!
thank you!
good morning, Hewitt Maurice Asset Management...
mr Stibbard? Effy Stonem. Pleased to meet you.
I'm terribly sorry, but Victoria's feeling under the weather.
I see. And no-One thought to let me know?
she asked me to cover this meeting. Can I take you for lunch?
Yeah, I keep telling Victoria that we're just not that into you.
you're a single fund.
she's just not getting it.
what is Hewitt Maurice's sudden interest in fund of funds?
well...
maybe she's just too polite To tell you that we know you have a liquidity issue.
Really? - Really.
in the current climate, we need to diversify,
and you are going to need some significant cash,
within the next two months If my research is correct.
OK, go on.
well, we've been looking into your investments...
OK.
I told Jane to cancel the meeting.
as far as I was concerned, it was being rearranged.
what the hell where you thinking?
I don't know what came over me.
don't give me that shit. You're a fucking assistant.
vic... - Jesus fucking Christ!
vic! - What?!
all right.
you fucking deal with her, then.
so, am I fired? - Looks like it.
that's bullshit.
you could have lost us an incredibly valuable investment.
and did I?
that's not the point.
I was good in there. Really good.
yeah?
that's what Stibbard said, too.
well, you'd better go. Pack your things.
I'm sorry.
pussy.
no, er... can I take a message?
yeah... OK.
just been fired.
what? You're the only one that understands Excel.

I think you agreed to expose your breasts if Stan here popped his cherry.
that's true. A deal's a deal. Can it, perverts.
is this the guy?
maybe we should leave town via the lake?

he's taped it to his stomach or his balls, to something.
it's messed up, dude.
Woo!

tea, can I get a minute?
sorry.
Abbud here wants to get jiggy.
you know it's right.
I'm not going to lie to you.
I am in love with somebody else.
it wouldn't make sense that I love you.
we just met each other, you know?
we don't know each other at all. This is crazy.
I have this physical need thing and I was hoping you do too.
nice. You got the magic touch with the ladies.
dude, watch out.
dude, I thought you were boning her.
did you already forget?
Oh, yeah, man. Yeah. We're boning, yeah.
I bone her all the time.
me and Cadie, you know? Non-stop boning.
non-stop boning.
Hey.
man, Stan's girl is weird.
she, like, lets him screw around.
yeah?
also, who are these people?
I almost got shanked in the bathroom.
Yeah, man, I know.
I'd say I know about maybe, like, 20% of the people here.
actually, dude, maybe more like 10%.
did you know that 53% of all statistics are made up on the spot?
dude, 83% of people know that.
I see you invited your Social Sciences teacher to aid this interaction.
Tina's here? Where?
# You are the morning
what's up? You want to dance?
what the hell's going on here? Where's your mother?
you said she wanted me here for dinner to discuss your progress.
um...
look, there's no parentteacher conference.
just you and me. Are you pissed?
what? Chris...
look, I don't think you get it, okay? I'm not...
look, you don't understand, okay? I can't...
I just...
you mean you just...
I just wanted you to come.
Chris.
look, I think that dancing is, like, the best thing in the world, right?
because it makes you healthy in your body, it also makes your mind better too.
and I know that you're sad sometimes.
and I hate that.
look, will you just stay, dance?
please?
okay.
yeah?
Yeah.
okay.
# You will miss me
uh, I can't do this.
what?
no. No, no, no, no.
no, no, Tina!
Tina, look. Look. I dropped a couple Erectagras.
by mistake.
and it's been like that all day.
it's just... It's kind of like a second leg.
I mean, third leg. Tina!
I think she's seriously crazy leaving a grand on her counter like that.
she smiled too much and everything, but she was okay.
I swear Chris gives them speed.
they move faster than normal fish.
I don't know what it'd be like, having a son like Chris.
he's fine.
he can be a real sweetheart sometimes.
Tony?
Yeah, one sec.
you know what I love about your body?
no.
one boob is bigger than the other.
Stanley.
Oh, my God.
sorry. I was just, uh, looking for a T-shirt.
it's just Chris said I could borrow one because someone puked on me.
Oh, I'll get you one.
Thanks, I'll just wait outside. Christ.
Stanley.
what do you like Stan, small or medium?
what do you think of my tits?
do you think one's bigger than the other?
which one do you prefer?
I mean, my eyes are kind of blurring, 'Chelle.
I could have an infection or something, you know.
here you go.
this'll look nice on you.
Thanks.
they're, uh... They're nice, Michelle.
sorry.
that was awesome. Shut up.
you know what, Tony?
your eyes are supposed to blur, too.
# Just leave me undesirable # Just leave me undesirable # Just leave me undesirable # Just leave me undesirable # Leave me undesirable # Just leave me undesirable
you okay, Chris?
Yeah, you know how I do. Is the crew asleep?
Yeah. I can never sleep in other people's houses, though.
I got pills.
a lot of pills, you know?
you want me to walk you home?
it's miles，but thanks.
Where's your mom, Chris?
no idea, man.
what was I supposed to say?
Yeah, I like your tits. They're very nice, symmetrical.
I mean, what's the right word, even?
nice" is okay.
think she'll be mad?
she'll be pissed at me?
it's just, you know, just took me by surprise.
I never thought I was ever going to see them.
stanley, your hard-on is digging into my back.
sorry.
Stanley? Yeah?
how long are we going to keep pretending we're having sex?
Oh, uh, I don't know.
I guess we can stop now.
it was only for the bet.
tea's tits.
we could stop pretending.
Yeah. Sure. Whatever.
I mean, why would Tony want to see Tea's tits anyway?
you know what, Cadie?
what, Stanley?
maybe I should've just said Michelle's tits were perfect.
do you think that's what she wanted to hear?
I don't know, Stanley.
don't worry, man. I've got change.
uh, how much am I missing?
15.0
you know what? My mom keeps money upstairs.
I'm just going to go get it. One second, all right?
What'd you do, Mom?
# Cause enough to come # Wherever # The day will run sundown # Do you understand # Before you pack up and fly?
so when's Tea's big gazonga flashing show going to happen anyway?
Oh, man, I don't know.
she was supposed to do it during last week's game and she "pussied" out.
I've been lying about having sex with Cadie for 2 weeks now, just so you get your lesbian ta-ta flash.
now you don't even want it?
stanley, you just had sex for the first time, all right?
you're no longer a pathetic little dork.
this should be a happy time in your life.
Yeah, except I didn't have sex.
that's a detail.
what's good?
you, uh, all right, Chris?
Yeah.
what were you doing in the closet?
it's not a closet. It's a wardrobe.
I was just, um, checking what stuff my mom took with her.
well, what did she take?
Oh, you know, everything.
do you think she's gone, man?
Hey, my dong's gone down finally, so that's good.
Yeah. It's not blue or anything, right?
no, it's a bit red, but it's not bad.
Yeah, you know, looking at it,
I actually think it may be a little bigger.
it may have done you some good.
I think it actually did. Yeah.
seven years bad luck.
what?
the mirror.
EW. Muscle chicks just creep me out.
that's because she's more ripped than most dudes.
still, I've always wanted to bang a female bodybuilder.
is there a female anything you hazen't wanted to bang?
uh, let me see.
there was this one girl, once.
but it turned out she was a dude.
Wow. It's the hips, just above the crease in her thong.
the way the skin bunches, you know?
dark tan; shiny, oily skin glistening.
she kind of looks like a superhero.
does everyone agree she looks like she's giving a...
Yes.
so, Stanley, you and Cadie get into any positions like that?
um...
that's an interesting question.
I would like to say that our lovemaking...
sex. Yeah.
that's what I meant: "sex.
banging. Right.
was, uh, you know, kind of traditional.
it was crazy.
crazy in a kind of traditional way, you know?
kind of tame for the first...
except when you put me in the pile driver.
I thought I was going to pass out.
I've never done anything like that before.
Yeah, except for that. I forgot about that part.
you're telling me that Stanley put you in the pile driver?
Yeah, Stan the Man. Porn star.
Hey, Stanley, what is the pile driver, exactly?
Oh, uh, you don't know?
it's not very common in my world, no.
well, you know it's nothing too fancy.
just when you're kind of piling on top of each other and, you know, just sort of just, uh, drive it home.
you just drive it home. I see.
Where's Chris?
I'm right here.
this man won't let us eat any pizza until you've paid him.
okay. Anyone got cash?
dude, you've got a grand.
no, I've got a sick system, about 4, 000 beer cans and a few of these empty wrappers.
what?
$1, 000 is not that much money nowadays, when you really think about it, so...
look, man, okay, so, I bought it yesterday, and I remember you because you have a very good face for memorizing, right, so I bought it from you and you were dying to sell it.
Yeah, there's a toaster pastry in the CD drawer.
take it out. Clean it. I'll pay for that part.
wrap it up and, you know, sell it to someone else.
Yeah, we can't sell that to anyone else.
Yes, you can, if you clean it.
Yeah, we're not going to clean it.
well, I'll clean it and I'll bring it back tomorrow.
it's destroyed. It's un-sellable.
no matter what you do to it, we're not taking it back.
well, I'll clean it, I'll bring it back tomorrow and I'll give it to someone else who works here.
no, you won't, because I'll have told them not to take it back because you've wrecked it.
I kept the receipt.
Yeah, receipts don't cover snack pastries.
I'll tell you how to get rid of your zits.
Oh, shit.
how?
you piss on a piece of toilet paper and wipe your face with it.
it works better than Clearasil.
tried it.
have you tried shitting on a piece of toilet paper?
okay, okay.
it's time to go.
well, thank you for stopping by Electronic Max's Sizzle Store.
now, is there anything I can help you with today, sir?
no, thanks.
Hey, Chris? Chris, wait up, man.
no.
it says out there "We buy anything.
get out of my store.
get out of my store!
what's up, Chris?
Hey, fat. What's happening?
little guy just loves watching me drop a deuce.
ain't that right, Che?
why'd you name him Che?
after the Argentinean Marxist revolutionary who fought his way out of monopoly capitalism, neo-colonization and imperialism.
Oh. Cool.
what can I do for you, Chris?
Hey, how'd you like that Lithuanian E, huh?
I got some mad strong pills just in from Mexico City.
they're calling them Dirty Sanchez.
I'm selling, actually.
you looking to buy a sweet system?
this baby's guaranteed to make the shorties go pop.
you know what I'm saying, dude?
I can't move that, dude.
now, that wheelbarrow, though.
now that's something I can really use.
you can never have too many wheelbarrows.
okay. Cool.
how do you want it?
powder, pills, cash?
cash.
tell you what. Let me see the pills.
you got it, boogie man.
come on, dog, you woke me up.
who are you?
who the hell are you? I'm sleeping.
this is my house.
nice.
get out of here.
get off me, man.
let go!
this ain't cool.
Hey, little bro. Hello?
you all right?
that was some fall. I thought you was going to be quadriplegic and shit, you know, vege-tized, drinking from a straw and shit. You know what I'm saying?
son?
look, I think you should go.
all right.
no, not up the freaking stairs. Come on.
Hey, let's stop all this, all right?
let's form some harmony here, my brother.
no, no. Shut up, man! Hey, hey!
get out of here. Let's find some harmony, dude.
I was just sleeping in your bath.
look, I've never met you before.
Yeah, but we met now, you know?
get out of my house! Whoa, whoa!
holler back.
very funny. Now let me back in, man.
yo, I'm gonna say this to you 'cause I got mad respect for you and 'cause we, like, roommates and shit, but, like, you are a very hostile little dude.
let me back in, man!
what is up with this aggression?
I think you got some issues, my dude, like, big issues.
like, you need to take it easy, maybe chill out just a little bit.
dude, let me back in now, man.
yo, hey, listen, you take a minute, you take a day or two, you think about it, and then you come back and we'll talk, all right?
it's my house.
I don't make the rules, brother.
I don't make the rules.
so, um, what are you going to do?
don't know.
I'll tell you what you can't do, Chris.
that's stay like you are.
you've got no money, basically no home.
you can't just keep on...
look, it's all my fault. I know. I messed everything up.
no, you didn't.
Tina...
do you think we could ever...?
Chris.
Hey, Chris. Pants.
Thanks.
how amazing am I?
don't tell her, dude.
you're kind of a big deal, man.
everybody's talking about some naked kid running through the halls with a tiny little...
Tony.
is this shirt okay?
what? He's not that pathetic.
you can take a joke, can't you, Chris?
why don't you try it? No mom, no dad, just all on your own.
sounds good to me.
I've got a dad.
there's no one home.
you'll be fine, Chris.
Chris.
Oh, well, what a great, um, surprise.
look, we're not planning on staying...
Hi, I'm Daisy.
Hi, Daisy. I am Mary.
well, um, come in.
your dad's on his way home, but I'm going to give him a call anyway, okay?
no, no. If he's not here, we'll come back.
okay. Okay. Oh, great.
that's fine.
Hey, why don't you come on over here and say hi to Sammy, Chris?
no, um, let him sleep.
okay.
so...
babies.
how's your mom?
that's actually... She's getting better.
Oh. She took another one of those things, did she?
no, not really. She's fine.
great.
you know what would be fun?
to look at some old baby photos of Chris.
huh? Would that be fun?
let's see. Graham has them by year.
I'm trying to get him to go by mood, but...
you won't find any of me.
Oh, you're worried that we're going to see something embarrassing.
Ah, bingo. Here we go.
Oh, look at that. He is even cuter than Sammy.
I know a mother shouldn't say that, but come on, look at him.
you do look really cute, Chris.
that's not me.
sure it is.
no, it's not. It's Peter.
huh? Oh.
well, I can still say he's sweet.
who's Peter?
he's my brother.
your brother?
you know...
Ah, Graham.
you'll never believe who's here. It's Chris. Isn't that great?
I'm going to take a shower.
get rid of him.
stop it. Why do you do this to him? He's your son.
I don't care!
are you okay?
I could never tie those knots in Cub Scouts, you know?
and they said, "Oh, he doesn't have the fingers for it,
or whatever.
but now look what my fingers can do, huh?
do you want to hear about the best day of my life?
cub Scout meeting.
I'd pissed my pants by accident.
they'd had us sitting down forever and, um, I was trying, trying to get out, like, to leave the room.
but this kid kept blocking me, stopping me from leaving.
he was, like, playing a game or something and, um, so I told him that he was a penis face and he better get out of my way, "Penis face.
and then the whole place went quiet because I just said "Penis face.
and then they were all laughing, everyone, and I couldn't figure out if it was because I'd swore or if it was because they'd seen that my shorts were wet.
so, I tried to cover the wet spot with my hands.
but that meant that they definitely saw.
and then there was more laughing.
but, um, Peter, my brother, he was like, the youngest sixer ever or something, and, um...
they're the ones in charge, sixers. Dib, dib, dib.
Yeah, he could tie all the knots perfectly.
him and my dad would practice. He loved it.
anyway, he stands up, sixer. And, um...
they all liked him.
and, uh, takes my hand.
and he took me to the bathroom.
and then he had me take my shorts off.
he cleaned me up.
and then he took off his shorts and put them on me.
and then he kissed me on the cheek and took my hand.
we both went out there, him just in his underwear.
no one laughed. Best day of my life.
Hey, don't, um...
don't tell the others about the knots and stuff, you know.
I won't.
do you know what you're going to do?
what, me? No.
do you think your mom's going to come back?
well, she's still around.
how do you know?
she left flowers by the grave.
so, anytime you see a nipple, ass crack or camel toe, you gotta do a shot.
down in one. You guys got it?
wait, what's a camel toe?
what? Are you serious?
it's when it bunches around the, uh...
it's a vagina thing.
Oh, my God. Is there slow motion on this thing, Michelle?
slow motion for what? There!
I just saw a nipple. I just saw a nipple.
concealed or free?
if concealed counts, we're going to be drinking a lot.
suits you, don't it, Muffy?
suits me to the ground, brother.
did he just call you Muffy?
anyway, so a nipple can be concealed and visible, right, Daisy?
what?
when you're wearing that red top.
will someone please find the remote so we can rewind it and see the nipple, please?
Where's the remote?
whoa, Stanley, buddy.
that's lend lease only.
what? Is everyone talking in code today or am I just stupid?
you're pretty stupid.
I just, um, gotta pee.
you better not be going to jerk off.
guys, where's the remote?
look for it yourself.
remote? Hello? It was just here.
Ooh.
I think we should go on a date.
what? Us?
I don't see anyone else here.
um, yeah, okay. Sure.
okay. I gotta go.
that's nice, Stanley.
so, what I want to know, Tea, is when are you going to come good on the bet?
I mean, Stan already lost his cherry.
that was part of the deal, huh, Stan?
Yeah. I guess.
Yeah, okay. Stanley got about as far with Cadie as I did.
huh? What?
no, I never boned Cadie.
Stan says he banged her brains out.
and, she's backing him up.
Yeah, and you already "wussed" out of it once.
I mean, I purchased tickets for that game, brought my brothers. I promised them Janet Jackson.
we got nada.
in my culture that's a loss of face, you know.
all right, well, if you guys want to see them so badly, why don't I just whip them out here and now?
that works for me.
Yeah, of course.
nipples! Everybody drink!
encore. We demand an encore, please.
I could take more.
me too. Show's over.
show me the money!
you jizz your pants, brown-eyed boy?
Oh, almost.
ow, ow, I just "spunked"!
Michelle, Get off!
Oh my God! Hi.
so, don't be "weirded" out by the, uh, collection.
this is only for a few days, okay?
until you find something else.
Thanks.
it's just, I could lose my job over this.
so, if you could just not...
I know.
Oh, um...
this is for you.
your friends said you like fish, so it's for luck.
Yeah.
okay.
I should go to bed.
okay, sorry.
you should do that.
good night.
[Boy] In a world full of superheroes, there are two that stand above the rest:
the Commander and Jetstream.
his super-strength makes him pretty much indestructible.
she has the power of supersonic flight along with a total mastery of unarmed combat.
by day, they live as Steve and Josie Stronghold, the top real estate agents in the metropolis of Maxville.
but whenever duty calls, they are the Commander and Jetstream.
me, I have my own names for them:
mom and Dad. That's me in the middle.
you look at them and see the defenders of the world.
all I see is my dad wearing tights.
don't get me wrong. It can be cool to have superhero parents, like when Mom picks up awesome takeout on her way home from work.
on the other hand, living up to the family name means that I'm supposed to save the world someday.
here we go.
[Boy] I just have one small problem.
[straining] Come on.
come on.
exactly what we want to hear.
[beeping] - Well, that was Bert Timmerman and he is buying the colonial on Pine Terrace.
above asking. No contingencies.
honey, I know that selling real estate is just our cover, but I think we're in line to win that sales trip to Hawaii.
we haven't been to Hawaii since King Kamehamayhem set off that volcano.
think of it, Josie: You, me on the beach, no exploding volcanoes.
Mmm, I can feel the sand in my toes already.
[Giggling] Will is gonna be down any minute.
Hey, it's his first day of school. Where is he?
Oh! Ah!
come on, buddy. Let's get moving!
Oh, hey, Dad. Just trying to get a few sets in before school.
low weights, high rep, huh?
good thinking. Don't want to bulk up.
Nah, going more for definition.
[Sighs] Big day, huh?
I just want you to know how proud I am that you'll be attending my alma mater and someday following me into the family business.
real estate?
right.
real estate.
on a more serious note, son,
I know that every kid thinks his dad's invincible and I nearly am, but who knows?
maybe the next time I punch a meteor hurtling toward Earth,
I'll be the one who shatters into a million pieces.
I-I guess all I'm trying to say here, Will, is it's nice to know that whatever happens to me, you'll still be around to save the world.
looking forward to it. - We all are.
Oh! Hey! - Oof!
good morning, Mrs. Stronghold. - Mornin'.
I noticed you had recyclables in the trash.
I took the liberty of moving them for you.
thank you, Layla. You hungry?
I've got plenty of eggs, bacon.
no, thanks. You know how my mom can communicate with animals?
apparently, they don't like being eaten.
how about some juice? - Great.
he's on his way. Oh, hi, Layla.
good morning, Commander. - Commander, huh?
Oh. Thanks, Layla.
[Josie] I can't believe you and Will are starting high school.
seems like yesterday you two were swimming naked in the kiddie pool.
mom! Hi, Layla. - [Cell phone rings]
[Layla] Thank you. - [Cell phone ringing]
Josie, it's... the other one.
go. - [Indistinct voice on phone]
I see.
thank you, Mayor.
there's trouble downtown.
big trouble. Downtown.
Oh, shoot, and I really wanted to see Will off to the bus.
I remember his first day of preschool. He wouldn't let go of my leg.
mom! - Oh.
Oh, Will, uh, a reminder.
a lot of the kids at Sky High will only have one superhero parent, not two, so take it easy on them, huh? No showing off.
Aw, Dad. Not to worry. I'll keep it low-key.
Mrs. Rivera? Josie Stronghold.
I'm gonna need to reschedule that open house.
great.
Steve! - Gotta go!
[ON TV]... reports of a situation downtown.
let's check with a picture from News Chopper Five.
evil has struck our morning commute.
here's a hint. If you're traveling eastbound on the 115, you might think about alternate routes.
hang on. This just in. The Commander and Jetstream are on their way.
are you sure he'll be OK? What if he forgets his lunch?
Josie, Josie, you've got to stop babying the boy.
you're right, you're right.
left. Left!
[Steve] Circle back around! - [Josie] I'm on it.
[Steve] Release! - Launch!
[ON TV] Oh! And the robot goes down!
he's plucking out a souvenir from another successful battle.
what a team!
[Man] How does it feel to save the world again?
what would we do without them? - They are good.
now, I know it's just our first day, but I already can't wait to graduate and start saving mankind.
and womankind. And animal kind.
and the rain forest. - Of course.
[Woman] Hello, kids. - [Both] Hi, Mrs. Kibbitch.
I just feel really good about this year.
Yeah. It should be great.
morning! - Mornin'.
is this the bus to Sky High?
Shh! What are you, crazy?
do you want every supervillain in the neighborhood to know we're here?
no, no. Sorry.
what's your name, freshman?
um, Will Stronghold. - [Gulps]
the son of the Commander and Jetstream?
everyone! It's Will Stronghold! Son of the Commander and Jetstream!
I'm Ron Wilson, Sky High bus driver.
if I can make your journey more comfortable, let me know. You two! Up!
the seat behind Ron Wilson belongs to Will Stronghold.
it would be an honor.
it's fine. You don't have to.
no, I want to. You're third generation, man.
magenta, get up.
Why? He only needs one seat. - So he can sit with his girlfriend.
Layla? No, she's just my friend.
Yeah, totally.
he's like my brother.
Oh, well, in that case, hi. I'm Larry.
yo, Will. Hey, how you doin'? Hey, Layla.
how you doin'? How was your summer?
to be honest, it was tough, man.
T-U-P-H. I was seriously sweatin' it.
my dad going, "Zach,
I powered up before I started shaving.
and here's me, dude, halfway through August, and zip.
Oh, so you... You don't have your powers.
you think I'd even show up today if that happened?
no. No, no.
woke up a few days ago and... bam!
that's great. So, what-what is it?
you have to wait and see like everybody else.
but it's awesome, man. It's awesome!
come on. It's not like you ever powered up in front of us.
[Brakes screeching] - Sorry!
morning!
that's everyone.
next stop, Sky High!
where are we?
hang on back there!
we're goin' off-road.
here we go!
pfff! Freshmen.
there she is. Sky High.
kept aloft by the latest in antigravitational propulsion.
she is in constant motion as a precaution against those who otherwise might have nefarious plans, her location supplied only to a few highly qualified individuals such as myself, Ron Wilson, bus driver.
smooth and easy.
[Kids] Whoa!
sorry!
word of advice.
don't miss the bus, 'cause the bus waits for no one.
except for you, Will Stronghold!
you ever running late, running early, or you just want to talk...
...give me a call. - Thanks, Ron.
seriously.
[Boy] Yeah! Freeze-Girl! - Hello, freshmen, don't be shy
welcome newbies to Sky High!
juniors, seniors, all the rest
we're back to school Sky is the best!
[Girl] Ready, one, two, three.
Whoo! We're number one!
sky High! We're... - I hate that cheer.
speed, round 'em up, OK?
Hey, freshmen!
your attention, please.
I'm Lash. Uh, this is Speed.
as representatives of the Sky High welcoming committee...
we'd be happy to collect that $15 new student fee.
um, there was nothing about a new student fee in the handbook.
OK, guys. Very funny. I'll take over from here.
Hey, everybody. I'm Gwen Grayson, your student body president.
I know you're all going to love it here at Sky High.
I know I have. [echoing] I've just had the greatest experience...
...but there are a few rules that I just want to let you guys know.
first of all...
if you can remember those few simple rules,
I promise you will not fall off the edge of the school.
[Laughter] - Follow me inside for orientation.
rules? What rules? - Weren't you paying attention?
good morning. I am Principal Powers.
on behalf of all the faculty and staff, welcome to Sky High.
in a few moments you will go through Power Placement and your own heroic journey will begin.
power placement? - Sounds fascist.
power Placement: It's how they decide where you go.
the hero track or the loser track.
Th-th-there's a loser track?
I believe the preferred term is "Hero Support.
for now, good deeds and good luck. Let the adventure begin.
comets away!
all right, listen up.
my name is Coach Boomer.
you may know me as "Sonic Boom.
you may not.
here's how Power Placement is gonna work.
you will step up here and show me your power.
and, yes, you will do so in front of the entire class.
I will then determine where you will be assigned.
hero or sidekick.
now, every year there are a few students or, as I like to call them, "whiner babies,
who see fit to question and to complain about their placement.
so let's get one thing straight. My word is law.
my judgment is final, so there will be no whiner babies.
are we clear? - [Murmuring]
I said, are we... [roaring] clear?!
[All] Yes, Coach Boomer!
Go-time!
you! What's your name?
L-L-Larry.
little Larry.
get up here.
[Layla] What's humiliating him going to prove? This is so unfair.
if life were to suddenly get fair,
I doubt it would happen in high school.
car!
big Larry. Hero!
so he's good. But I'm better.
[Boomer] Did I say you were next?
name's Zach, Coach Boomer.
try not to drop your clipboard.
any day now, superstar.
I'm doin' it. - Doin' what?
I'm glowin'. - I don't think so.
well, it's easier to see in a dark room.
turn off these lights, cup your hands around your eyes and look real close...
sidekick! - Are you sure you don't want to just...
[roaring] Sidekick!
you! Front and center!
let me start off by saying - what an honor it is to... - Is that your power? Butt-kissery?
very funny, sir. I've heard you had a wicked sense of...
shut up and power up. - Right away, sir.
say, that's pretty impressive...
...for a Popsicle! Sidekick!
hero!
side... kick!
[Boomer] Super spit?
sidekick.
[Boomer] Acid spit.
hero!
ho! Hero!
and a handsome one at that.
get out of here, knucklehead!
[Boomer] Purple kid. Let's go.
what's your shtick? - I'm a shape-shifter.
OK. Shift it.
a guinea pig? - [Magenta] Yep.
not even a swarm of guinea pigs?
uh, no.
sidekick. Shoo!
bite me. - You. Flower child. Let's go.
uh, I believe in only using my powers when the situation demands it.
well, you're in luck.
this is the situation, and I'm demanding it.
but to participate in this test would be to support a flawed system.
the whole hero-sidekick dichotomy only serves to...
let me get this straight.
are you refusing to show your powers? - It's more complicated.
[echoing] Sidekick!
[Bell rings] - We'll pick it up right after lunch, starting with you.
[Zach] That's not cool.
I tell you, Boomer will regret making me a sidekick.
I tell you, Boomer will regret making me a sidekick.
all right? Someday it'll be dark, he'll be all alone, walking to his car.
he'll drop his keys, and I won't glow to help him find 'em.
you got a problem with me?
uh, no. - No what?
no, sir. No, sir! No, sir!
just messin' with you, sidekick.
you're not supposed to use your powers outside of the school gym!
[OVER PA] The cafeteria staff requests sidekicks stop ordering hero sandwiches.
am I crazy, or is that guy really looking at me?
[Zach] Dude. - [Will] What?
that's Warren Peace. - That's Warren Peace?
Yeah. - [Layla] I've heard about him.
his mom's a hero and his dad's a supervillain. Baron Battle.
where do I come in?
your dad busted his dad. Quadruple life sentence.
no parole until after his third life. - [Sighs] That's great.
my first day of Sky High, and I already have an archenemy. Hmm.
is he still lookin'?
no. - No?
no.
I thought you said he wasn't looking.
[OVER PA] A reminder: There is no smoking on school grounds, or freezing or bursting into flame.
I'm...
Aha! Mind reader!
no. Name tag.
right. Uh...
uh, these are my friends. That's Zach.
[Zach] What's up? - And...
Layla. Got it.
I'm Gwen. - [Layla] Hi.
I love your skirt. - Th-Thanks.
how's Power Placement going? - Um... great.
I'm not surprised.
I need a freshman rep for the homecoming committee...
...we could talk about it over lunch. - I eat lunch.
[Chuckles] How cute is he?
I guess I'll see you guys around. - [Will] Yeah.
[Layla] I don't think she really liked my skirt.
see you.
and thanks for the swirly.
what's up, guys? - The kid, uh, looked a little dehydrated.
how about it, Stronghold? You gonna hang with us this year?
help us bring some pain to the sidekicks?
[Stammering] That sounds like... fun.
hmm.
good man. See you around.
[Will]... what it actually is...
what do you mean, you don't know what your power is?
well, uh... - [Boomer laughs]
I got it. You're messin' with the coach.
just like your old man! Car!
Wow! - That was close!
are you insane?!
I don't have super-strength!
Oh, I get it.
you're a flier, just like your ma. Why didn't you say so?
quit messin' around. I haven't got all day.
what's your power? - I don't have one.
[roaring] Siiiide...
...kick!
hmm. I remember doing this to your father when he was just your age.
kicked me through that wall!
you, uh, haven't called him yet, have you?
like I want to be the one to tell the Commander his son has no powers?
let's... Let's take a look at that chest.
well, nothing seems to be broken.
except for me not having my powers.
well, maybe you're just a late bloomer.
you could get one of them or both.
your mother's flying or your father's super-strength.
but when?
the kids who get bit by, uh, radioactive insects or fall into a vat of toxic waste, their powers usually show up the next day. Or... they die.
Ooh, lookit.
but kids who inherit their powers...
...well, impossible to say.
but I will get them, right?
many sidekicks are the offspring of one super-parent, mmm, and one ordinary parent. Hmm!
but there are cases, rare, yet not unheard of, where the child of two super-powered parents, mmm-mmm, never acquires any... powers whatsoever.
there are?
like who?
well, I know of only one. Ron Wilson, bus driver?
there he is.
there he is now.
a three-and-a-half bath Victorian with original crown molding?
you bet we'd love to take a look. How's, uh...
when do we brief the president on supervillain infiltration of the IRS?
president would be Monday.
Tuesday? Great.
no, thank you, Linda.
hon, dinner's almost ready. Could you stop playing with your robot eye - and help set the table? - Sure.
Oh, there he is! - Hey.
[Steve] Man of the hour! - Well, how'd it go?
um, Dad, we need to talk.
you mean a little hero-to-hero talk?
I think I know just the place. Come on.
hon?
OK, so, Dad... - Oh, this isn't the place, Will.
this... - [whirring]
...is the place.
no way! The secret sanctum?
you know, I'll never forget my first day at Sky High.
your grandfather finally trusted me enough to give me the key to his secret sanctum.
course, in those days, we still used keys.
go ahead, son.
I already added your biometrics this morning.
Oh, Will, one thing.
course, you must never ever bring anyone into the secret sanctum.
that's why it's called the secret... sanctum.
uh, I would never.
go for it.
Oh, this one's mine, Will.
you can use Mom's. - Sorry.
no way.
you've got a pool table?
how about the pinball machine? - [Both laugh]
man. - Let's see. Where do I start?
uh, I don't know. Over here we got Mom's stuff.
uh, scientific equipment, gadgetry, whatnot.
all our greatest battles.
our finest moments.
Ticranium's head.
Exo's number one bug-bot.
and is this, uh...? - Royal Pain's Pacifier.
now that was a great day, Will.
the first time your mom and I ever teamed up to fight evildoers.
soon as she came smashing through the window, I knew she was the one for me.
I wish you could have seen us. We were fantastic!
royal Pain got his, and I got the Pacifier.
and this is my proudest possession.
Oh. Well, it's amazing. - Well. [chuckles]
what's it do? - No idea.
so this is it. It's all down here.
our story, your mom and me, of, well, kickin' butt and takin' names, huh?
but now it's time for a new chapter in the story.
the three of us, fighting crime together side by side... by side.
now, what was it you wanted to tell me about?
Oh, um...
...that I'm gonna kick your butt at pool!
well, we'll see about that! - OK.
choose your weapon, sir. I'll break.
[Steve] There it is. - [Will] You got the right one.
[Man] You were right. [Laughs]
he took it home.
Hey, he's got the ego the size of a giant robot.
[Choking] Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
Hey, Layla. - Hi.
so where were you after school? I was worried.
I got stuck in the nurse's office.
and the news just keeps getting better and better.
turns out I may never get my powers.
how'd your dad take it?
what was I supposed to do? He showed me the secret sanctum.
you have to tell them.
my parents are the greatest superheroes on the planet.
everybody expects greatness from me.
well, you are great.
Thanks.
OK, so you're a sidekick.
it's not the end of the world.
when life gives you lemons...
make apple juice?
I can't make lemons. I don't know what it is.
Yeah, but see, no.
you have an awesome power. You could have made hero easy.
I'm not into labels.
but why would you choose to be a sidekick?
because I think the whole thing is stupid.
dividing people into groups like that. I mean...
...what is this? - High school?
[Layla] Apple?
[Will] Thanks.
morning, class.
welcome to Hero Support.
my name is...
...all American Boy!
course, nowadays...
...I just go by Mr. Boy.
but this year, it will be my privilege to help each of you become the very best hero support that you can be.
without hero support, why, there wouldn't be any heroes.
all right, there probably would be heroes, but they would be very lonely.
lonely heroes indeed. And...
yes?
uh, yeah, um, when do we pick our names and costumes?
because I call dibs on "Zach Attack.
well, you don't get to pick.
on graduation day, you'll be assigned to your hero, and then he or she will, uh, decide what you will be called and what you will wear.
I think this is mostly done in an attempt to avoid clashing colors.
that's why when I was paired with...
...the Commander, red, white and blue it was, which for me was a very good thing because, uh, as you can see, blue really just makes my eyes pop!
it's very dramatic. - Huh.
uh, excuse me. I didn't know you worked for the Commander.
I worked with the Commander.
we were a team,
Mr... Mr... Stronghold!
you Steve's son?
and he never mentioned me to you.
I don't... I don't think so.
makes sense.
that makes perfect sense, because the Commander does not have time to sit around flipping through scrapbooks that I took the time to make for him.
no, the Commander's got to be out there saving the world!
with your mom. Your mom.
she ever mention me? - Uh...
[Rumbling] - Incoming!
Oh, look. He does glow.
I told you.
greetings.
little misfire in the Mad Science Lab.
no need to panic, unless you're a single-cell organism.
[Mr. Boy] Mr. Medulla, we in Hero Support are trained never to panic.
[Mr. Medulla] My bad.
I'll get the nurse... unless she's injured.
Ah!
change... and ho!
now you. Go!
go!
go!
go!
go!
[Laughter] - Go back.
[Will] OK, number one.
a radioactive zombie is charging at your hero.
do you hand him: A) his silver-tipped crossbow;
b) a wooden spike; C)...
yo, that's so weak, man.
I'm holding his crossbow. Why can't I shoot him myself?
cause we're hero support.
and if your hero asks for a crossbow, - you hand it to him. - Or her.
by the way, Zach, you can't kill a zombie.
you can only re-kill him.
or her. - If you kids are all in here, who's out there saving the world?
dad. Why are you home so early?
after I stopped the Superdome from collapsing,
I was watching the game and got to thinking, "It's been a while since Will and I tossed the old pigskin around.
I thought I'd hustle back home, but I see you and Layla have already made new friends.
it's an honor to meet you, sir.
what's your name, your power? - I'm Ethan, and I melt.
Zach. I glow. - I see.
magenta. I shape-shift.
Shape-shift! - Into a guinea pig.
great. Great.
great. Great! Really great.
well!
I make a mean tuna fish salad sandwich.
anybody want one? - No, no, no.
pleasure meeting everyone.
they're a good bunch of kids, Will. - Yeah.
can I ask you something, though?
does that one kid really, you know, glow?
sometimes.
boy, they have really lowered the bar some for superheroes at that school since I went there.
well, actually, he's a sidekick.
Oh. Well, that makes sense.
Yeah.
actually, they're all sidekicks.
good for you, son.
kid of your stature hangin' out with a bunch of sidekicks.
as a freshman? I didn't have the guts.
and I can only imagine what your grandfather would have said if I'd have brought some of them home. [laughs]
you know, there's nothing wrong - with being a sidekick, Dad. - Oh, no.
of course not. I used to have one.
saved my life once too.
old... what's-his-name.
so then you would be fine with...
...if I was a sidekick.
well, yeah, sure, I guess.
Hey, hand me that mayonnaise there.
well, that's good then, because... because I am.
am what? - A sidekick.
who is? - Me, Dad.
dad, I'm a sidekick, OK?
I washed out of Power Placement.
washed out! - [Glasses rattling]
couldn't make the big time, so now he thinks he can pass judgment on some real heroes' kids, huh?
Oh, it's a power trip, Will.
that's all it is. Sonic Boom?
try "Gym Teacher Man.
no, Dad! What are you doing?
I'm calling the school. The tuition we pay them!
dad, don't. Dad!
it's not Coach Boomer!
it's me, OK? I don't have any powers.
but you never said...
I mean, you made it seem like...
like I had super-strength like you?
but I don't.
but you will, Will!
you're just...
you're just a late bloomer! That's what it is!
maybe. Maybe not.
but I don't care.
because, really, the fact of the matter is
I'm proud to be a sidekick.
actually, I'm proud to be hero support.
uh, so I, uh, think we pretty much covered the undead.
what's next?
what?
your hero flies north at 300 miles per hour for 15 minutes.
his archenemy is tunneling south at 200 miles per hour for 10 minutes.
assuming your hero has X-ray vision, how long before he realizes he's going the wrong way?
all I ever wanted for him was to save the world.
to just feel that once.
that's a lot to put on a 14-year-old's shoulders.
Oh, come on, Josie!
when I was his age, I could put a truck on my shoulders.
Oh!
honey, I know you're disappointed.
so am I. You think I didn't want to see my son fly?
or have super-strength? - Or fly?
but we can't change who he is.
not without dropping him in a vat of toxic waste.
Steve! - Aw... Oh, no, no...
where would we even find a vat of...
Steve! - I-I just, I'm thinking.
will is a great kid.
this is not the end of the world. OK.
so maybe we won't be the Stronghold Three, the greatest family of superheroes the world has ever known.
but we will be the Stronghold Three, the greatest family the world has ever known.
you're right.
you're right, and he can always go into real estate!
welcome to Sky Hi...
[Lash] Come on, Ron.
Hey, big boy. Where's your hat?
Hey, where's your hat?
if you're not gonna respect me, at least respect the hat!
Oh, pfff! - Guys. Guys, come on.
give Ron his hat back.
all right. You're the sidekick.
give him his hat back.
[Speed] We'll catch you later, Stronghold. [laughing]
Hey, race you up the steps.
Thanks, Will.
sure, Ron.
[Layla] Over here! - Saved you a seat!
Hey, and I saved you a pudding!
Hey, what's up? - Hey, buddy. Check this out.
Whoa!
uh... sorry. - You will be.
let's not do this.
you think you can do whatever you want 'cause your name's Stronghold?
I'm sorry my dad put your dad in jail, but...
nobody talks about my father.
Ah!
Oh, it is so on!
[Kids chanting] Fight, fight, fight! - Mr. Boy, do something!
I'm on it!
principal Powers!
principal Powers! Principal Powers!
principal Powers! Principal Powers!
[chanting] Fight, fight, fight!
[Chuckling] Oooh!
[All chattering] - Hurry up! Move out of the way!
Oh!
where are your sidekicks, sidekick?
[Zach] Right here!
Yeah.
leave them alone!
he's strong!
I'm strong?
he's super-strong.
Yeah, Will!
now, who tripped me?
what if I said it's not just her twin? It's her evil twin.
this Friday, you say? - Medulla, you dog!
think I can't take a hit?
will! Pull the pin!
he's comin', man!
Hi.
I didn't do anything, though. He started it.
your dad started it, and I'm gonna finish it.
[Clicking] - [Powers] Don't bother.
the Detention Room neutralizes all super-powers. Sit.
now, here at Sky High we do everything we can to teach you how to use your powers.
but what you do with them, now that's up to you.
living up to your father's reputation or trying to live it down is a sad waste of talent. Your talent.
try to keep that in mind the next time you're about to do something stupid.
[Exhales] All right, look.
whatever happened with our dads, it has nothing to do with us.
what do you say?
I say if you ever cross me again, I'll roast you alive.
[Josie] So, Will, anything interesting happen at school today?
uh...
well, as you may have noticed, I got my powers today!
Yes, we know. The principal called.
OK. Look, it's not...
it's not as bad as it sounds.
it's a really funny, great story. - You nearly destroyed the cafeteria.
Yeah, but, Mom... I got my powers!
and do you know how to use them wisely?
sanctum. Now.
...come here!
you're not mad?
my boy has super-strength! How can I be mad?
[cracking] - Ow!
I'm sorry. [cracking] Ow!
you are strong! - Yeah.
if your mom asks, you tell her I read you the riot act, and...
...I took away your Xbox.
but I don't have an Xbox. - Are you sure?
Oh! Go ahead. - When did you...?
what? - Open it up!
here. Here, I'll get it.
all right. Let's see.
[Male voice] The boy has Stronghold's power.
it's almost poetic. - We should crush them now.
we know he has the weapon. - Patience!
we have waited this long.
when the time is right, we'll have our revenge.
you know, time would move a lot faster if we had an Xbox.
Ah! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
dude, you made sidekick history! - Aw. I don't know about that.
dude, you made sidekick history! - Aw. I don't know about that.
no, seriously. From now on, people mess with us at their own peril.
you're breaking down barriers, proving we're not heroes and sidekicks.
we're just people. - Super people.
[Bell rings] - Seats, please.
we have a lot to cover this morning, starting with motorcycle sidecar basics.
uh, except for you, Mr. Stronghold.
would you gather your gear and come up here, please?
I've got your new class schedule.
Congratulations. You've been transferred to the Hero class.
Oh, and by the way, if you should find yourself needing any hero support,
I still do a little freelance. Ha!
ha!
but what about them?
we'll see you on the bus. - We'll hang at lunch.
right after you've dunked Ethan's head in the toilet.
[Sighs] Well, you best not be late.
just go already.
Rays!
from the silliness of the shrink ray to the devastation of the death ray.
these are the very foundations of Mad Science.
yes? They told me you were coming.
unfortunately, all the lab partners are taken.
I suppose I could pair you with my teaching assistant.
miss Grayson? My apologies.
[Medulla] Come on.
come on! Quickly, quickly, quickly.
feet! You stepped on my foot!
OK, how's that?
perfect... if you're building a heat ray.
you're supposed to be building a freeze ray.
OK, I have no idea what I'm doing.
dreadful technique.
you've confused rays with beams! D!
minus! I'd give you an F, but that would only mean having to see you in summer school.
and what have we here? - Uh...
well, I don't know. I didn't do it.
you're far too modest, Mr. Stronghold.
or perhaps not modest enough.
miss Grayson, in the future, please allow the students to succeed, or fail, on their own.
how did you do that?
I'm a Technopath.
I can control technology with my mind.
Wow. All I can do is punch stuff.
yet he'll be the one on cereal boxes.
show me the justice in that.
miss Fernandez, kindly thaw out Mr. Hellman.
that was amazing. - So is what you did in the cafeteria.
Yeah. Once they start handing out grades for destruction of school property, I'll be in good shape.
you know, I can totally help you out with all this science stuff.
[Stammering] Yeah, you'd do that?
Mm-hmm.
I could be, like, your... private tutor.
cool.
guys! Guys! Over here.
will? Sitting with Gwen Grayson?
man aims high. Gotta give him that.
sorry. All full.
that's OK.
uh, I think I see an empty table over there.
come on, guys.
no offense, Will.
we are not running a loser outreach program. OK?
I'm sorry. Penny can be a little...
...full of herself sometimes.
sometimes you have to act nice...
I just don't want them to sit here. - OK.
Layla! What's up?
Hey, you smell nice.
Tecomaria capensis. Honeysuckle?
listen. About lunch... - What about it?
at the table, Penny was being...
please. Not a big deal. - No, it is, and...
I feel bad, so let me make it up to you.
maybe tonight we can go to the Paper Lantern?
but you hate Chinese food. - But you don't.
paper Lantern. 8: 00.
no, guys!
whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
come on, buddy. Easy, guys.
Thanks, Will. - All right.
[Low hum] - [Layla] You OK?
Yeah, thanks. - Zach too.
come on.
not so tough when my boy's around, are you?
you just think you're so big and bad, huh, Stronghold?
no, I-I don't. - Please! Will will totally take you.
you saw what happened to Warren?
watch it, Stronghold. That big mouth is gonna get you in trouble.
I didn't say anything. - Why not settle this in P. E?
what? - [Ethan] You're on.
if Will beats you in Save the Citizen, lay off sidekicks for the year.
and if he loses, you can dunk Ethan in the toilet every day till graduation.
Yeah! Huh? - You got yourself a deal.
wait, guys, guys. - Bring it.
c-come on! Guys, are you crazy?!
and those guys are undefeated!
and you barely know how to use your powers!
sorry. Not helping.
will, you have no choice.
you can't let them dunk Ethan's head in the toilet. Not again.
the dunking must end.
[Crowd chanting] Five! Four!
uh! Hey, what's up?!
Ramirez! Hamilton! Your citizen has just been mulched because you failed to defeat your villains.
next round. Speed, Lash, you want to be heroes or villains?
villains. - Yeah.
Ooh, there's a surprise.
who do you want to beat next?
all right. We'll take little Stronghold and, uh, let's see...
and we pick Peace! - [Crowd groans]
remember when we used real citizens? - [Chuckling] Yes. Yes.
hothead, Stronghold, you're the heroes.
[Warren] Hey! Get your head in the game!
you have three minutes to immobilize your opponents - and save the citizen! - [Voice box] Save me!
ready! - Save me.
set!
battle!
[Crowd] Oh! - [Grunts]
Oh!
ha! - What now, Peace?
[Lash] Ow!
Hey! Coach, that's a foul! Call something on that!
save me! Save me!
[Boy] Are you blind, ref?
watch it, hothead!
Ahhh!
what? No! Wait!
No! Wait!
Hey!
save the citizen!
save me. - You are so dead!
save me.
save me.
save me.
the vortex sucks away the oxygen.
no oxygen, no flame.
come on!
save me.
save me.
save me.
[Crowd] Five! Four!
three! Two! One!
time!
she's alive!
heroes win!
[Boomer] Speed, Lash, hit the showers!
Where's my boy?
Whoo!
yo, we're right here! - Here!
I just can't believe you won Save the Citizen as a freshman.
that's never been done before!
and you topped Mom's best score on the pinball machine? Get outta here!
that is hilarious. - There they are.
Gwen? - Hey.
Oh, uh, Dad, this is Gwen Grayson.
Gwen Grayson, this is Dad.
Mr. Stronghold, it's such an honor.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
Oh, not at all. Will and I were just hangin'. Chillin'.
honey, Gwen is a Technopath, and she's offered to help Will with his science homework.
and she's a senior.
we said we'd work on that antigravity stuff tomorrow, but something came up.
any chance we can do it tonight? - Sure. Yeah.
on one condition, Gwen. You join us for dinner.
Oh, no, I couldn't intrude.
Oh, yes, you can. - [Josie] You must.
OK. Well, thanks.
so should we get started? - Certainly.
well, she's gorgeous.
and she fixed the disposal.
Really?
so there we were, in the middle of nowhere, and she's like, "I can't change a tire!
I can only change the weather!" - [All laughing]
I'm like, "Can you at least make it stop raining?
uh, I'll give him a few more minutes.
so, Gwen, do we know your parents?
Mmm. I don't think so, Mrs. Stronghold.
dad went inactive a few years ago.
lets Mom do all the work now, huh?
mom passed away when I was a baby.
so I did have an ulterior motive in coming here tonight.
will told you I'm the head of the homecoming committee?
uh, he most certainly did not.
well, I was wondering if you'd consider attending the homecoming dance.
we would love to chaperone. - Sure.
that's very nice, Mrs. Stronghold, but no.
we were hoping that you'd be the guests of honor and receive the award for Heroes of the Year.
still workin' on that?
Hey. - Hey.
we go to school together.
you're Stronghold's friend. - Yeah.
Yeah.
you're not supposed to use your powers outside of school.
I was just gonna stick it in the microwave.
uh, I was supposed to be meeting Will here, but, um...
you want to sit down?
I think I can spare a minute.
[Laughing] Oh, look, hon.
there's... What's his name? Kid with the gravity.
Lance, I think. Lance something. - Yeah.
Oh, my gosh, look. There's Boomer.
[Will] He had a mullet?! - Oh, God.
Oh, whoa-whoa-whoa. Remember her?
hmm? She was a weird one. - [Josie] Oh, yeah. Sue Tenny.
disappeared right before graduation.
why is that? - No one ever really knew.
some say she was, uh, recruiting villains at the school.
others say she was smoking in the girls' room.
nightmare. All right, now.
speaking of villains, there's one of the worst. Baron Battle.
[Will] Warren's dad?
always swore he'd have his revenge on me.
and he totally stole the lead in Oklahoma!
you have to stop caring about that.
it's a long time ago. - Hon.
don't wanna talk about it! - You deserved it.
then there was this time in first grade.
you know how you grow lima beans in school?
will could not figure out why mine grew so quickly.
it was driving him crazy. So finally I took mercy on him and I told him about my powers, and we've been best friends ever since.
hmm.
and falling for him, was that before or after the lima beans?
what? I am not in love with Will Strong...
is it that obvious? - Yeah.
great. - So why don't you tell him?
well, I was gonna ask him to homecoming, but there's two problems.
he likes somebody else, and she's perfect.
hmm. You know what I think?
to let true love remain unspoken is the quickest route to a heavy heart.
Wow.
that is really deep.
Yeah.
and your lucky numbers are...
...four, 16, five and 49.
I gotta go.
see you around, hippie. [Speaking Chinese]
you didn't have to walk me home. - [~ Cary Brothers: True]
I did if I wanted to spend any time alone with you.
[Laughing] And, just so you know,
I don't usually hang out all night with my mom and dad.
your parents are great, Will.
I'm so glad they're coming to homecoming.
[Sighs] Now, if I could only find someone to go with.
you don't have a date for homecoming?
well, I've gotten a few offers, but...
...I turned them down.
I'm just waiting for the right guy.
Oh.
you, Will.
me?
Oh, hi, Daddy.
Bye, Will.
Bye.
you're not that boy with the six arms, are you?
no, sir. Just two.
well, keep them to yourself. - Yes, sir.
good night, sir. - [Door slams]
Yes! Whoo!
Oh, man! OK. Here you go.
Oh!
homecoming. The greatest collection of superteens ever gathered to dance under one roof, and then we shall have our revenge!
there's only one thing we're missing!
king Kamehamayhem's surfboard?
darn this joystick!
Ah! Right, right. The Pacifier.
Hey, smooth move on the joystick.
Ahhh!
[Choking] Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
you're not gonna believe what happened last night.
Oh. I love these.
your loyalties are clear when it comes to friends.
Oh, God. Oh.
Oh, I totally spaced. Uh...
I'm sorry. I know you must want to kill me.
actually, just the opposite. I have something to tell you.
yeah? - Yeah, but you first.
OK. OK. It's about homecoming.
Really? Me too.
I'm going with Gwen Grayson. Can you believe it?
me, a freshman, going with the most amazing girl at Sky High.
that's awesome! - I know.
[Ron] Morning!
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. What's your homecoming news?
I'm going too.
really. Who with?
who with?
Yeah, who asked you?
Oh, who asked me.
warren Peace? You can't be serious.
Layla, the guy's a psycho. And he's my biggest enemy!
how could you go with him? When did you even start hanging out?
last night, 8: 00, the Paper Lantern.
Hi, Warren.
did I do or say anything last night to make you think this is OK?
funny. You're never gonna believe what happened.
I was about to ask Will to homecoming when, wouldn't you know it, I said I was going with you instead.
I don't remember that being the plan.
Hey. You did the history homework?
what are you doin'? - Sitting.
no one sits here but me. - Mm-hmm.
What'd you get for four? I wasn't sure if Tigerman was, A) bitten by a radioactive tiger, or B) bitten by a regular tiger, - You're doin' it to get to Stronghold. - Yeah.
then I'm in.
but I'm not renting a tux.
Hey, if Warren's not here, is this still the tough-guy table?
Yeah, homecoming's stupid.
so? I think I'll go. - Yeah, me too.
what's up, guys? - What up, dude?
Hey. - What's going on?
nothin'. - Let's go, Stronghold.
only two days till your Mad Science midterm.
I am not gonna rest until you can build a ray gun blindfolded.
hey there, cutie. I was just thinking about you.
I cannot wait until homecoming. I'm so excited. I finally...
Ow! - Never call me cutie.
and is this the trigger?
no, that's the fusion device.
OK. Is...? What's this?
that's my phone.
well. Super-strong and psychic.
Hello? - [Indistinct voice on phone]
wait. Penny, I can't understand you when you're all talking at once.
OK, better.
what? Oh, no.
OK, hold on. Let me call you back. - Hurry!
what's up?
problem with the homecoming decorations.
penny forgot to order the fog machine, so I might have to build one myself.
think the committee could stop by? - Ooh, I don't know because, uh, my parents are on a distress call, and they won't be home till late.
I'm not supposed to have anyone here. - It's cool.
I was just hoping we could spend a little more time together, but...
...I guess I'll just see you at school?
good night, Will.
uh, I... If it's...
um, if it's only a few people.
super.
Brian! You're getting cheese all over the walls!
Larry, do you have to be a two-ton rock right now?
please, just power down. - [Grunts]
Hey.
guys, guys, guys, guys! Guys, the floor!
Gwen! You said this was supposed to be homecoming committee.
[Chuckles] This is the homecoming committee.
OK, OK, so a few extra people showed up.
but, Will, you're popular! That's what happens!
Gwen, every kid in Hero class is here.
how am I gonna get this place cleaned up in time?
here, come with me.
OK. So, what's on your mind?
my friends. - What about 'em? They're all here.
Oh. You mean the sidekicks.
I think I'm just gonna call Zach and Layla, tell 'em to come over here because...
will, you are such a nice guy.
but, honestly, do you think they'd have fun?
with this crowd? I mean, don't you think they'd feel a little awkward?
no. I think they'd be OK. - Trust me.
they'd be miserable.
Whoa! - Hey!
sorry!
just lookin' for a bucket!
I wish there was somewhere we could go to be alone.
um...
Wow. This is incredible.
Yep. When you spend your whole life kicking butt and taking names,
I guess you make a lot of memories.
well, maybe we should make a few of our own.
what's she doing here?
isn't it past her bedtime?
Hey, Will? Could you go get me a diet caffeine-free orange soda?
anything for you.
who invited a sidekick? - Yeah, what's she doing here?
leaving.
Where's Will?
honestly? Avoiding you.
look, Will knows you have a crush on him.
he does? - Everyone does.
will's too nice to say he's not interested.
not that you can take a hint. I mean, hello?
he's going to homecoming with me.
he threw a party and didn't invite you.
you're just embarrassing him. You're just embarrassing yourself.
OK. I understand.
and, um, when you see Will again, can you tell him that I never want to talk to him again?
I'll give him the message. - Layla.
have fun with Gwen. You two deserve each other.
Gwen. - Oh, thanks, Will.
what did you say to Layla? - Nothing.
I mean, I just told her the truth.
you're a hero, she's a sidekick. She was holding you back.
what?
why would you do that? Layla's been my best friend since first grade.
you've got new friends now, and I think that you need to figure out whether you want to hang with us or with those losers.
come on. Let's go. - No, forget it.
I'm not going anywhere with you, not now or not to homecoming.
might as well just find yourself a new date, Gwen.
you're dumping me? [scoffs]
Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's get something straight, OK?
you do not dump me! Not the night before the dance!
sorry, Gwen. I, uh, just did.
you're dumped!
that's it. Everyone, out!
party's over!
don't stop on our account. - [Music dies down]
your father and I fly to Europe for two hours, and you throw a party?
unbelievable.
when I reach the count of three, I want everyone out of this house!
son, I'm only going to ask you this...
dad, I swear, I didn't plan this.
all right. That's good enough for me. Hmm?
Steve, I have got half a mind not to let him go to homecoming.
that's fine. I'm not going anyway. - Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
your mom said she had "half a mind.
will, you have to go to the homecoming dance.
we all have to because we're introducing the world to the Stronghold Three, the greatest family of superheroes mankind has ever known.
did something happen, Will? - I don't want to talk about it.
well, we're gonna talk about it because...
...we promised Gwen we'd go to the dance!
and when a Stronghold makes a promise, son, that promise is kept!
I promise you, Dad, I'm not going.
Hello? Layla? Pick up, Layla.
pick up, pick up, pick up. Fine, don't pick up. It's me.
I'm going to the Paper Lantern. If you get this message, meet me there.
you said that? - True story.
you're so funny. - I love life!
Thanks, Boom, for inviting me.
Ha-ha-ha.
you'll like this one. It was the spring of '88...
[Will] Layla. Layla, just pick up.
in case you didn't get my earlier messages, - I'm at the Paper Lantern, and I... - [beeping]
[Voice mail] Message box full. - [Sighs]
what are you doing here? - I'm, uh, looking for Layla.
do you know where she is? - How should I know?
you're taking her to homecoming. - Oh, yeah. Right.
[Sighs] Well, you don't have to worry about me ruining your night.
and why is that? - Because I'm not going.
hmm. Well, that sucks.
because we're only going together to make you jealous.
huh? - Dude, you're so stupid.
she's totally into you. - Not after tonight.
I wouldn't be surprised if Layla or any of the other guys - ever want to talk to me again. - Yeah.
you must have been a real jerk. Because no matter what I do, - I can't get 'em to stop talking to me. - Thanks.
Hey, you want to dance? - No.
me neither.
hey there, Layla.
you look like you could use a drink.
no, thanks.
Oh, don't worry. The bubbles are just ginger ale.
[Lash] Oops. [laughing]
the guys at this school are jerks!
thanks a lot.
I thought you weren't gonna rent a tux.
it's my dad's. He doesn't have much use for it in solitary.
cheese cube?
we're taking off now, hon.
still time to change your mind and come with us.
Nah, I don't think so.
mom, you ever feel like you messed something up so bad that you'll never be able to fix it?
people make mistakes, Will. That's what high school's about.
heck, that's what life's about. The key is to learn from them.
I hope my friends see it that way.
if someone is a true friend, you'd be surprised at how understanding they can be.
Thanks.
do me a favor? Put this away for me.
I caught your father sneaking it out under his cape.
he's convinced that everyone wants to reminisce with him.
I bet. Will do. - Love ya.
have fun.
that's weird.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I gotta get to Sky High.
Josie, wait.
we can't unveil the Stronghold Three without Will.
it's just... it's just not the same.
maybe we should fly home.
and we really don't need another award.
[Powers] Welcome, Commander and Jetstream!
good evening. First, a quick announcement.
the owner of the blue cold fusion-powered jet pack, you left your lights on.
sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.
and now, please help me welcome the head of the homecoming committee, the girl who made all this possible, Gwen Grayson.
thank you, Principal Powers.
and a very special thank you goes to our guests of honor and the recipients of our first-ever Hero of the Year award, - the Commander and Jetstream. - [Applause]
and to mark this occasion, we've planned a special tribute to the most powerful super-being ever to walk the halls of Sky High.
me!
royal Pain is a girl? - Yes, I'm a girl, you idiot!
how I ever lost to a fool like you I'll never know.
now prepare to be Pacified!
do you honestly think you can kill me with that little toy gun of yours?
my dear Commander, who said anything about killing you?
Ahhh!
Josie! I've always...
Rock-a-bye, baby! [Giggling]
What'd I miss? Ah!
boomer! Get the kids out of here!
hothead! Find an exit!
get as many people out as you can!
I'll slow her dow...!
thanks again for the lift, Ron. Now, if I'm not back in 30 minutes...
come in after you! Got it!
I was gonna say go get help.
go get help. Got it! Now get in there!
sorry!
[Layla] Where are we? - [Zach] Hey, Warren, how 'bout a torch?
[Warren] Only if you want to get barbecued.
ladies, if I may.
[Magenta] ~ Then all the reindeer loved him ~
[Ethan] Way to glow, Zach. - Thanks, man.
sup, kid?
you're never gonna believe this. Gwen...
is Royal Pain's daughter. - Yeah, and she...
stole the Pacifier. - Right.
she turned everybody into babies, including your parents.
OK. That I didn't know.
this is even more than the great Will Stronghold can handle.
she's right. It's gonna take all of us.
all of who? You and Warren?
the rest of us are only sidekicks.
just because you have powers, that doesn't make you a hero.
sometimes it just makes you a jerk.
makes me a jerk.
I guess what I'm trying to say is... - We get it. You've been a jerk.
in case my homecoming date ends up killing me tonight,
I just want you to know...
[Penny] Isn't that sweet?
I hate sweet! - [Laughing]
you guys are a part of this too?
why am I not surprised? - Go take care of Gwen.
we'll handle these clowns. - [Chuckles]
go.
Whoa!
while pushing down on the infant restraint, pinch the two straps together.
pinch, Royal, pinch. - Pinch what? Restraint A or B?
now you just calm down. Let's go back to one.
Ahhh!
come back and fight! You...
[Penny] Come on, sidekick! You gonna fight back?
I don't believe in using powers for violence.
I don't believe you even have any powers!
go, Penny! Beat Layla! Go, Penny! Beat Layla!
you can't hide forever, sidekick!
no way.
sucks for you!
I take you back, my dear Commander, to your senior year at Sky High, a time before anyone knew what a Technopath was.
so a brilliant but misunderstood girl named Sue Tenny was written off as a science geek and stuck in Sidekick class.
she hatched a plan, so daring, so visionary, to start her very own Supervillain Academy and raise a generation of heroes from scratch as villains.
but first she had to destroy the very institution that dared to spurn her genius!
and now, so many years later, that plan is complete.
my only regret:
that this may be the finest supervillain speech ever given, and you don't even know what I'm saying.
[Will] But I do.
look. I'm sorry that my parents destroyed your mom.
now put my dad down.
no one could defeat Royal Pain.
when the Pacifier exploded, I wasn't destroyed.
I was merely turned into a baby.
stitches took me away and raised me as his daughter.
daddy's little girl. [Laughing]
I told you never to call me that! - [Whimpers]
lunatic!
[Sighs] That's right.
royal Pain wasn't my mother. Royal Pain is me!
Oh, my God.
I made out with an old lady.
Yoo-hoo! Right here!
whoa, whoa, whoa!
way to go, Popsicle.
Hmm!
big mistake.
but I thought you were a sidekick!
I am a sidekick.
don't leave us here to die!
royal Pain sabotaged the antigravity device!
the whole school's gonna fall out of the sky!
we only have 10 minutes!
here's the antigravity room.
didn't Royal Pain seal off every route?
what about this conduit? - Right.
you'd have to be like a rat to fit in there.
Oh, great.
[Magenta] This is so stupid.
OK. OK, you're doin' great, Magenta. Looks great.
look at those cute little legs. OK, go about 10 feet.
Yeah, there should be a opening on your right.
[Magenta] Gotcha! - Find the access panel.
what? - It leads to the generator.
[Magenta] I'm on it!
No! - [Yelling]
and there goes your last chance of stopping me.
we'll see about that!
huh? - [Will] Surprised?
so am I. - You're flying?
that's impossible!
Ah!
there's only one person authorized to transport superheroes.
and that's Ron Wilson, bus driver. - [Grunts]
[Groaning] - And I'm Ron Wilson, bus driver.
I found the generator... I think.
chew the wire to the scrambler.
cut the wire connected to the scrambler.
the red one. - What?
cut the red wire!
there's a lot of red wires down here.
[Layla] The school is falling!
Ahhh!
chew!
chew the wire!
[Man] All unpacked, and the movers didn't break a thing.
told you we didn't need that extra insurance.
no, I know. - [Electric whining]
Oh, no!
[Zach screaming] It's all on you! Hold me! Hold me!
Ahhh!
whoa. That could have been messy.
[Will] Good night.
Ohh! - Chester? Chester?
now what? - Beats me.
perhaps I can be of assistance.
it should only take me a couple of hours to reconfigure the Pacifier.
Mr. Peace, would you please carry me to the Mad Science Lab?
sure. - And, Mr. Peace.
regrettably, I have made boom-boom.
people, if you've already been de-Pacified, please find your clothes, grab a baby and report to the Science Lab.
mom? Dad? Guys?
I just want to say sorry because this whole thing was my fault.
honey, you can't blame yourself. - 'Course not.
how were you supposed to know your girlfriend was a psychopath?
no, that's not it. Um, you gave me one rule, and I broke it.
I took her into the sanctum, and that's how she got the Pacifier.
the whole party was a trap. - And so was the homecoming, Will.
we all fell into Royal Pain's trap, but you defeated her.
you saved Sky High, and everyone in her.
I didn't do it by myself. - Excuse me. Steve? Josie?
even though it appears Gwen only came up with this award as a way to lure you to the dance and your ultimate doom, still it's inscribed, so...
I'd be honored to accept this "Hero of the Year" award.
but I'm afraid this doesn't belong to us.
[Josie] It belongs to them.
the sidekicks.
I mean, hero support.
why don't we just call them what they really are, Josie?
heroes.
Oh, and, Jonathan?
whatever you're teaching them, keep teaching them it.
sure.
[Powers] What a waste.
I can't do anything more to help you.
I'm not Wonder Woman, you know.
I went through puberty twice... for this?
I have de-Pacified all the babies and destroyed that horrible weapon forever.
let's boogie!
this is so sweet, I could hurl.
tell me about it.
do you wanna dance? - [Zach] Yes!
I mean, yeah. Yeah.
[Will] Compared to homecoming, the rest of the year was pretty boring.
Gwen and her gang got what they deserved.
but now nobody wants to save the citizen.
uncle! Uncle!
relax. I'm just kidding.
but they are getting to spend a lot of quality time together.
Oh, yeah, and Ron Wilson, bus driver, fell into a vat of toxic waste.
he now works for the mayor, defending the city from giant robots.
so in the end, my girlfriend became my archenemy, my archenemy became my best friend and my best friend became my girlfriend.
but, hey, that's high school.
[~ Flashlight Brown: Save It for Later]
good job.
good job.
good job.
come on, marcus. You can do it.
Hey, darwyn!
Hey, marcus.
how did you know we were here?
you told me marcus has swimming lessons every friday.
so you decided to stop by.
you know, gayle, if you're still mad at me
how was your weekend?
excuse me?
I stopped by the store.
your boss said y were out for a few days.
it's funny, because you told me you were tied up at work.
I guess he ruined it, then.
what?
my surprise.
close your eyes.
keep them closed.
all right.
it's -- it's beautiful.
but I don't understand.
why didn't you tell me you were going away for the weekend?
I had parole obligations I needed to take care of.
I don't like to keep reminding you that you're seeing an ex-con, okay?
you deserve better.
what is it?
it's nothing.
it's just, it's been a long time since anyone's given me...
...a present.
so, I can drop marcus by my sister's tonight, if you want to come over, have some dinner.
Yeah, I'd like that.
she's a piece of ass, that woman.
she looks like she can handle herself in the bedroom.
is that true, darwyn, or are looks deceiving?
what are you doing here, man?
spying, skulking around, following your brothers in the shadows. What are you doing?
I'm just trying to keep you from grave sin.
you know the punishment in the holy qu'ran for fornication.
it's 100 lashes.
only if you have four witnesses.
I can get them if I need to.
romantic relationships complicate our mission.
if you need sexual release, go pay for a whore.
if you're broke, I'll lend you the money.
but don't allow yourself to get emotionally envolved.
that's a sacrifice you have got to make for the cause.
and what do you know about emotional involvement or sacrifice?
I haven't spoken to my wife in 18 months.
and only allah knows when
or if... I'll ever see her again.
your wife?
is she here in the U. S?
what did they tell you about questions?
get in.
take the wheel. I'll be back in a minute.
what do you want?
you're taking a little day trip -- to vancouver.
I have a paper due tomorrow.
okay. All right.
Vancouver. No problem.
bring one of the pathogen test kits from the dna lab.
so, this is it.
and then we're done, right?
right?
get moving.
you're on a tight schedule.
darwyn, what's up?
we got a problem.
I'm at usc,
P. A.A. B.S. Building.
programs for the advancement of biomedicalbiochemical sciences.
farik just went in.
what, is he moving on the anthrax plan?
holy shit. Who is this guy?
I'll get back to you.
get in.
l. A.X.
take the 10 to sepulveda.
I don't want to have to deal with the 405 at this time of day.
I have to stop by my apartment and pack.
don't worry.
I already packed for you.
take his bags and wait outside for a minute.
the white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
no parking.
drive around the terminal. I'll be back in a few minutes.
take your bags.
who is this?
it's darwyn, man.
I'm at L. A.X. International departures.
farik leaving the country?
no, it's not farik.
it's an asian student from usc.
I don't know his name.
male, mid-20s, works in the P. A.A. B.S. Building, so odds are he's a biochemist.
listen. I slipped my cellphone on him so you can track him with the GPS
are you fuckin'kidding me?
farik and this kid are in the terminal right now.
are you gonna get on this?
all right, I'm on it.
thank you.
Yeah, I need to get the bureau substation at L. A.X.
gentlemen...
copy that.
all agents converge on station 3.
survey, but do not intercept.
I've got a visual on the subjects at security station 3, bradley terminal.
ASAC fuller, you getting this?
Yeah. Proceed, but be careful.
no matter what, we can't take a burn on this.
please have your tickets and identifications out for inspection.
only ticketed passengers beyond this point.
all cameras, cellphones, and other...
don't worry.
the angels will be watching over you.
all infants should be removed from strollers.
subjects are separating.
main subject's stepping outside the terminal.
yeah?
darwin, you got to get back to the terminal. Farik's on his way out.
I'll put a cia surveillance team on that kid as soon as he touches down into canada.
isn't canada an "eyes only" country?
we can't spy up there.
we're americans. We get to spy on whoever we want.
just get out of there.
we have one more stop to make.
international arrivals this time.
arrivals?
As-salaam alaikum, brother.
who are you?
I'm the angel that will be watching over you.
As-salaam alaikum.
Alaikuas-salaam...
it is such an honor to have you here in los angeles.
the honor is all mine, brother.
I am a humble servant of allah.
Brother...have the preparations been made?
everything is in place.
what we'll do this week will be a great victory for islam in america.
so, who is this guy?
he's an alim from yemen.
that's pretty hefty security for a religious guy.
well, we live in dangerous times, my friend.
follow the van.
always three cars behind him.
I'm impressed. That's very professional, darwyn.
I didn't know the army taught surveillance protocol.
Rangers train for urban warfare.
counterinsurgency is pretty fucking thorough.
how does it make you feel, knowing that your old buddies are killing muslims in a crusader war?
most of the guys I served with, they enlisted to escape poverty, get an education, follow a family tradition.
they didn't sign up to fight a crusade.
by participating in the war, they are as guilty as the man who ordered it.
do you really believe that things are that simple
black and white, good versus evil?
Yes. I do.
Mr. Korjenick?
Yes. Sorry.
you ordered a kosher meal?
Ah, thank you.
enjoy.
always order kosher when you fly.
because it's halal?
cause they always serve you first, and it doesn't taste like shitty airplane food.
it is the ultimate example of how the jews control america.
even in the little things, they come out on top.
we have a very special opportunity tonight, to listen to and observe a very special man.
who among you has heard of sheikh zayd abdal malik?
I read something about him.
he's an up-and-coming scholar from yemen, some sort of expert on the qu'ran?
brother abdal malik is going to be in los angeles for a few days.
and it will be our privilege to hear him speak in the islamic center after maghrib prayer tonight.
I thought you wanted us to stay away from mosques.
now you want us to go listen to a sermon?
you have a problem with that?
you're the boss.
activating passive tracking.
triangulating.
we got a signal.
where are we going?
I love this song.
dear brothers and sisters in islam, it is my great pleasure to introduce to you a great sheikh, a beacon of light for the ummah
brother zayd abdal malik.
As-salaam alaikum.
to speak to us today.
he will give a talk in sha' allah on some of the critical issues facing islam today.
I hope you will all attend.
but first, it is time for the maghrib salaat.
I ask the sheikh to honor us by leading the jamaat.
Alaikum as-salaam.
it's on the roof, in the A. C. Unit.
you take the bag. Do you understand?
it's here.
my friend must test the contents first.
it's the real thing.
anthrax.
so, what now?
now you drive the R. V.
back to los angeles.
are you fucking with me or what, man?
don't doubt your ability, brother.
you were a star pupil at your uncle's camp.
and more important than that...
farik chose you.
he wouldn't have done that if you weren't capable.
trust me. I know.
so I better get going, then.
that's the spirit.
but first, there are some people I'd like you to meet.
who the hell are they?
relax.
she is your wife, those are your kids for the duration of the journey.
kids?
the woman has all your new documents.
once you're over the border, you drop them off at the rest stop outside of seattle, and then you go on to L. A. Alone.
you're doing the right thing.
in the name of god, the merciful, the compassionate...
brothers, sisters...
what is the greatest threat facing islam today?
american aggression in the middle east.
the zionist occupation of palestine.
these are merely symptoms...
the real threat...
is in our hearts.
instead of allowing islam to transform us, some muslims are trying to transform islam to serve their political agenda.
they are using the label "islam..."to kill, murder innocent people, something that the prophet would never have condoned
remember sura 13, verse 11...
God does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.
how can we end the oppression of the muslims by resorting to even worse behavior?
if our spiritual and our moral condition worsens, how can we expect god to improve our economic and our political conditions?
this is the fallacy of the self-styled jihadists, who
I hope I haven't angered you, brother.
As-salaam alaikum.
who murder innocent civilians
how can you expect muslims to be civized when the americans, the israelis, the russians kill thousands of muslim civilians and dismiss it as collateral damage?
the holy qu'ran permits an eye for an eye.
if the unbelievers kill our civilians, we have the right to do the same.
Allah permits retaliation only against the guilty party, not against innocents.
Sura 53, verse 38, says, "no soul shall bear the burden of another.
the holy qu'ran also says, "and kill them wherever you find them.
and drive them out of the places where they drove you out, for persecution is worse than killing.
you forgot the first part of that verse, brother
fight in god's cause against those who fight you, "but do not commit aggression. God does not love aggressors.
there are many who are seeking god, but instead end up following the devil.
the corrupt teachings of the terrorists are satan's way of deceiving those seeking the straight path.
if any of you wish to learn about true islam,
I will be here in sha' allah later tonight after isha prayer.
I invite you all to come speak with me.
As-salaam alaikum.
how'd you get mixed up in all this?
I ask no questions.
they say, "we take you to U. S.A.
and I go... for my kids.
I love U. S.A.
land of the freedoms.
Yeah.
God bless america.
so, what's the story with this asian kid?
his name is eddy pangetsu, graduate student of microbiology, immigrated from indonesia with his family 15 years ago.
he met up with your bosnian.
Yeah, on the plane to canada.
now pangetsu is smuggling in the anthrax in an R. V.
which we're going to intercept before it enters the U. S. Border.
how do you expect me to keep my cover once farik finds out this eddy guy is caught?
ray, I'm the one that drove him from the science lab to the airport.
farik will put all this together.
he will pick up, and he will leave.
all right, relax.
we got it all worked out, okay?
the less you know about it, the better.
so, what's this deal with this speech at the islamic center?
farik had me tail this religious scholar from yemen, and then he had us all go hear him speak.
his name is zayd abdal malik.
you've heard of him?
Yeah.
he's a prominent islamic scholar.
he's been running this program out of sanaa to reform al qaeda sympathizers.
abdal malik says that these terrorists are just misguided cult followers that need to be deprogrammed, all right?
he's even convinced the yemeni government to release over 300 of these extremists after, of course, he's convinced them to accept true islam, whatever that is.
Ray... that is my religion.
okay?
sorry.
Listen...this man, he walks the walk.
what I don't understand is why farik is interested in this guy.
I mean, their beliefs are diametrically opposed.
or maybe this abdal malik is in league with bin laden and company.
he's just showing this moderate face to the world as a means to secure the release of al qaeda's best and brightest under the pretense of reforming them.
you don't really believe that, do you?
I believe in that as much as I believe in these jailhouse conversions of his.
I mean, think about it, man.
you're rotting away in some yemeni shithole of a prison.
suddenly, you change sides, and you're released.
what would you do?
I think you're misreading the guy.
I saw him speak.
my gut tells me he's the real thing.
all right, look...
I don't profess to understand your faith or anybody else's faith, for that matter, but I don't see how saying a few lines out of the qu'ran is gonna convert a murderer into a solid citizen.
you're right, ray.
you're right.
you don't understand my faith.
well, fuck me.
brother... come join me for some tea.
your aide said you were expecting me.
you remind me of him.
Why?
you are looking for answers... as was he at one time.
Allah often guides such people to me.
what you said tonight... - Troubled you.
Yes.
it's very different from what I've been told.
there are many false teachers taking verses from the glorious qu'ran out of context, corrupting the teachings of the holy prophet.
Sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam.
what is the greatest jihad?
to fight the unbelievers in battle.
no.
no?
the holy prophet
sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam -- said that war against the unbelievers is the lesser jihad.
the greatest jihad is to battle your own soul, to fight the evil within yourself.
so, who is a true holy warrior, then?
the prophet's cousin ali, who was fighting an unbeliever in battle, and he gained the upper hand.
just as he was about to strike the death blow, the unbeliever spat at him.
ali threw down his sword and refused to kill him.
Why?
ali said that, when the man spat at him, he himself became angry.
and he was no longer fighting for allah, but to avenge his own pride.
he knew that if he killed that unbeliever out of anger rather than out of a desire for justice, he would be a murderer in the eyes of allah on judgment day.
that, my brother, is a true holy warrior.
so, you're an artist.
shit, no.
just airbrushing little designs
tattoos on fingernails, that's all.
no, no, no. Don't sell yourself short.
this stuff takes talent.
you see, I, on the other hand, would be hard-pressed to draw a stick figure.
that's all right.
you got other useful talents.
so, what's this stuff we're listening to, anyway?
this "stuff" is pharoah sanders.
cool name, at least.
what? You don't like jazz?
can I be honest?
I hate jazz.
what?
I was just thinking...
how we have virtually nothing in common.
and yet...
and yet...
...I can't get you out of my head.
that's the beauty part, isn't it?
Yes, officer.
sorry for the delay. We have a little bit of a problem.
I'm sure we'll get things moving along as quickly as possible.
can I see your passports, please?
wait here.
I hope everything's in order, sir -- I mean, ma'am.
thank you for your cooperation, mr. And mrs. Pangetsu.
welcome back to the united ates.
I haven't seen you in a while.
I had business to attend to.
as do we all.
but before we begin...
goddamn it.
what's wrong?
Oh, you'll find out in a second.
Yep, now the audio is totally fucked.
what is that?
it's a white-noise generator.
it makes it almost impossible for anyone listening in to understand what we're saying.
so, what did you all think of the great sheikh last night?
he's a traitor to islam!
isn't that a little extreme?
extreme?
dude, we're fucking terrorists!
I mean...
sorry.
holy warriors.
the point is, it's people like this guy that pose the greatest danger to our cause.
america can keep bombing muslim countries, and we'll just grow stronger.
but this abdal malik guy wants to put out the fire of jihad from within
lead us all like sheep to the slaughter!
you disagree, christian?
no.
he's an asshole.
likes to confuse people.
sounds like most of the imams we had in bosnia before the war, always talking nonviolence and interfaith cooperation, which made it easy for many of their own people to be led like lambs to the slaughter.
so, what's this really about?
a few days ago, I received a fatwa from the ulama, declaring abdal malik as a murtad...
an apostate, who betrayed islam.
and the punishment for apostasy is death.
the great sheikh is planning on leaving the U. S. This evening.
and we have been commanded to execute him before he gets on that plane.
why risk our major attack operation for one man?
the brothers have a pretty big network in yemen.
why don't we let them take him out back home?
abdal malik is planning on delivering a fatwa of his own at the islamic center condemning our brothers in al qaeda as criminals who should be fought by all muslims.
a fatwa issued in the U. S.
by such a charismatic and prominent scholar could mislead millions of muslims...
and strengthen our enemies.
this would be a huge P. R. Blow to our cause.
so...we have to close the book on this scholar... today.
I'll do it.
Why?
you don't seem to care one way or the other about this guy.
you're right.
I don't care.
but you need someone cold and detached, not jacked up on emotion.
you're right.
potassium chloride.
when administered intravenously, it will simulate a heart attack.
is that another dose of cipro?
I don't think so.
call fuller.
I'll take care of it.
you back him up.
okay, let's go.
you went to see abdal malik by yourself.
remember, christian... satan's best trick is mixing truth with falsehood.
you understand the difference between the two, don't you?
so, what was that stuff that farik gave you?
a lethal injection.
Farik's sending tommy with me to take out abdal malik.
he's teaching at the islamic center this afternoon, so that's our only window.
I don't know, man.
that just sounds like a power play to me, one jihad against another.
that's bullshit, ray.
if they want him dead, we should want him alive.
he's an asset to us any way you slice it, you understand?
all right, all right, all right.
I will back you up on this, darwyn.
Tommy's presence is gonna complicate things, but I can handle it.
Thanks, ray.
we won't regret this.
Hey, thanks for your support back there, darwyn.
I thought you were my friend.
just trying to do you a favor.
murder is ugly business.
fuck you, man.
look out!
are you okay, man?
you got to be kidding me.
what do we do, man?
all right, uh... go back to the van.
send farik a text message.
let him know that we got to abort.
he's gonna be pissed.
it's all my fault. I'll take the heat! Just go!
sir, are you the driver of this van?
Yes, officer.
please get your license and registration.
nice work. - Stay put.
we want to get some information.
this ought to keep them tied up for an hour or two.
by then, abdal malik will be on the next plane to yemen.
it's in the air-conditioning unit.
I'm proud of you.
you're going to be remembered as one of the great holy warriors of our time.
there's nothing there.
What?!
it has to be there. I don't understand.
look, everything went according to plan.
nobody was up there! I swear!
get in.
farik, I'm telling you from here to vancouver, nobody was
get in!
Christian...
I'm glad you came today, brother.
in a few minutes,
I will be giving a speech in which I will issue a fatwa against the murdering devils who have hijacked our beloved islam.
it will, in sha' allah, be a historic moment for the deen.
I have something to confess.
what is it?
I am a mujahid man in a faithful unit here in los angeles.
we are planning something...
an attack.
many people will die.
you must turn yourself in to the police immediately.
listen to me, brother, and remember what the holy qu'ran says
to kill one innocent man is to kill all mankind.
to save one man is to save all mankind.
you have the opportunity to save many lives.
I know.
understood.
it seems the canadian authorities are about to announce that they've seized a large shipment of anthrax en route to indonesia, being sent to an islamic terror group planning an attack on jakarta.
No! No!
you faithless whore.
you stole our anthrax...
and tried to ship it to your uncle in indonesia!
you put your petty little tribal wars ahead of the worldwide jihad!
no, farik, I swear to allah
I did not!
please have mercy, al-farik.
I can't have mercy on you.
only allah can.
now you ask for his forgiveness now.
and you formally ask for his mercy!
now!
forgive me, brother.
all right, try not to lose this one, okay?
I'll do my best.
not that I'm complaining.
small price to pay for snatching up all that anthrax.
Yeah.
what about eddy pangetsu?
eddy didn't make it.
he was in an R. V. That went over the side of malibu canyon.
we might have been able to intervene, but
I know.
it would have compromised the case.
the worst part is, when I drove that kid to the airport, he looked ripe to be flipped.
I mean, I bet we could have brought him over to our side.
look, man, in order to preserve your cover and your life, somebody had to take the fall.
and it's not as if we knew he was gonna get killed.
you did good work today, darwyn.
but there's something else.
what?
I wanted to tell you myself before it came out in the news.
abdal malik is dead.
what?
he was found at the mosque.
a massive coronary.
we think farik got to him.
Ray...goddamn it.
you should have swarmed that place with L. A.P. D.
and show our hand?
correct me if I'm wrong here, darwyn, but aren't you the one that's been telling me we have to see this thing through all the way to the end?
is that right?
that's right, isn't it?
I'm sorry how this went down.
it happens, but sometimes you get beat.
that's not good enough, man.
Darwyn...you just helped prevent a wmd attack on american soil.
and you're my fucking hero.
I'm sorry about abdal malik.
but in the bigger scheme of things, man
no, no, no.
see, just
that's just it, ray.
in the bigger scheme of things, saving abdal malik was just as important as stopping that fucking anthrax.
this isn't just a war on terror.
it's a war within islam and...
and people like abdal malik are the only ones that can help us win.
I came as soon as I got the call. What's going on?
sorry to pull you in this late. We just tracked down our perp.
lieutenant, this is the doctor I mentioned.
Yes. Forensic psychologist? That's right.
nice to meet you. Where's Crane?
he's already interrogating the suspect.
what do you mean, Crane's interrogating the suspect?
we know you saw more than you admitted.
tell us. We mean you no harm.
the suspect is obviously teeing up an insanity defense.
she's smart.
she knows exactly what she's doing. She?
why is that?
why are you deceiving us?
what did you see?
what is going on here?
we finally caught Abigail Mills. Mostly thanks to the good doctor here.
caught? I don't understand. She didn't do anything wrong.
did she? I think you know the answer to that.
stop lying, Abbie.
the truth will set you free.
captain!
the door's locked!
sir!
let me out of here! Someone let me out of here!
let me out! Let me out!
let me out!
let me out of here!
this is Mills. Dispatch here.
emergency response has requested you at 3rd and Main.
on my way.
what kind of dream? A really weird one.
you were in it.
and what, pray tell, was I doing in your dream?
freaking me out even more than usual. Mills.
what's going on, Captain?
do you know a Dr. Mara Vega? No. Should I?
we have our crisis responders up there now trying to talk her down, but she doesn't want to speak to anyone except, apparently, you.
why the lieutenant?
that's what I need her to find out.
Dr. Vega?
lieutenant Abbie Mills.
you wanted to speak to me?
it was my fault.
everything she saw was real.
I believed her and I lied.
should have told the truth.
about what? Who are you talking about, Doc?
your sister Jenny.
it's my fault, Abbie.
I deserve it.
I've had this coming a long time.
we all have.
wait... Don't!
are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay. What happened?
I'm not sure. It was bizarre. It was really bizarre.
Dr. Vega... It was like she was sleepwalking, her mind was elsewhere, and her eyes... they were glazed over white.
glazed white?
maybe she was prescribing herself some sort of recreational drug.
didn't look like that or anything else I've ever seen before.
all the color was gone.
uh, medic, I'd like to see the body before you remove it.
I'd like to take a look at her eyes. Yeah, sure.
it presents as a massive cataract.
no sign of trauma, no petechiae.
no one sees or goes near this body until I say.
you understand?
what the hell is going on here?
a complete stranger summons Lieutenant Mills to her side before sleepwalking to her death.
this after her eyes somehow transmogrified into sand-filled orbs of the purest white.
what else is going on, Lieutenant? - She mentioned my sister, Jenny.
she must have known her, maybe that's how she knew who I was.
hang on a sec.
did your sister spend any time at Tarrytown Psychiatric?
first year she was committed, yeah.
been in and out of there for years. - Dr. Vega's one of the resident psychs.
I'll get you all of her files. See what you can dig up.
in the meantime, let's keep a lid on this.
the last thing we need around here is another episode of The Twilight Zone.
Yes, sir.
care to share any additional information you withheld from the captain?
you know the nightmare I had? You were in it, so was the requisite faceless nightmare monster, but...
Vega was there, too.
except that is impossible because I have never met her before.
I think our definition of possible has been irrevocably broadened.
you had a prophetic dream warning you of an impending event.
which stands to reason, given that, according to Washington's Bible...
the Book of Revelation foretells of two witnesses, I know.
I am a cop in a small town.
so let's not curse me as a capital "W" witness just yet.
consider what you just saw. This isn't simply a suicide.
this pertains to the seven years of tribulations.
the creature in your nightmare... I barely saw it.
perhaps it is the true cause of the doctor's death.
a soldier in the army of evil sent against us.
against you, the capital "W" witness.
maybe. But unless you have an encyclopedia of faceless nightmare monsters, why don't we just start with a little regular detective work here?
one more time. From the beginning, Jenny.
I saw a demon.
I heard a voice say, "Come and see.
then... I wasn't in the forest anymore.
where do you think you were?
listen to this... Vega's private notes.
Jenny exhibits no other signs of delusion.
what did you do?
sorry. Continue.
the better I get to know her, the more I believe she's telling the truth.
there are at least three other similar mentions.
Vega knew that Jenny wasn't crazy.
yet she allowed her to remain institutionalized, presumably from fear of censure.
believe me, fear is a pretty powerful motivator.
fear causes inaction. Inaction causes pain.
QED, fear causes pain.
I'll grant it's a syllogism, but you get my meaning.
Vega feels responsible for keeping Jenny committed.
the guilt eats her up inside until she can't take it anymore.
she seeks me out for some kind of absolution, then jumps. QED, case closed.
you're forgetting about the doctor's white eyes.
about the sand that poured from them and your prophetic dream about Dr. Vega.
and Vega's last words.
before she jumped, she said that she had it coming.
we" have it coming.
and you question that this death has to do with your role as a witness?
fine. Let's say that this is some evil minion sent after us by the demon in the woods. What does it want?
why hurt Dr. Vega, and what do I have to do with any of it?
my best guess is the enemy wants what all enemies want.
to thwart his opponent.
clearly you're a threat to him as is your sister.
we must speak to her at once. - No, it's not happening.
I understand you've not spoken to your sister in some time, but...
we don't talk, period.
what time doesn't change, death will, don't you suppose?
now, I'd rather keep the latter at bay.
okay.
you want to see her? Let's go.
see for yourself.
this is pointless. All of our personal issues aside, she's not gonna help me because I'm a cop and she's a criminal.
Oh, she's a criminal now? - Do you know why she's locked up in here?
she broke into a sporting goods store and stole a bunch of survival gear, over 4, 000 bucks' worth of stuff.
does your current law enforcement incarcerate all thieves in sanatoriums?
she told the cops that she needed it because she was preparing for the End of Days.
Oh, well, she's perfectly sane, then.
lieutenant Abbie Mills to see Jennifer Mills.
I'm her sister. - I didn't know Jenny had a sister.
she does.
one second.
extension 49, please.
don't be afraid of number 49, Abbie.
when was the last time you saw your sister?
I'm sorry. Saw or talked to?
last time I saw her was back row of a county courthouse five years ago when she was arrested for breaking and entering the first time.
I tried to offer to help. It's complicated.
I'm sorry, Miss Mills, but Jenny doesn't want to talk to you.
thank you.
you're an officer of the law.
is she not obligated to speak to you?
I could force the issue and make Jenny talk to me, but that isn't gonna get us what we need.
would you be amenable to my speaking with her?
if she's amenable. Sure, knock yourself out.
would you, again, please?
thank you for seeing me, Miss Mills.
curiosity got the best of me.
who are you? Abbie's new boyfriend?
we are amicable, and yes, I am male, but I suspect you're implying something else.
what's your name, tall, dark and British?
my name is Ichabod Crane.
what do your friends call you?
Icky"?
not if they wish to remain my friends.
sense of humor, too.
I've seen the demon in the woods.
the one you and your sister saw as children.
they lock you up in here when you talk crazy.
that's why I'm in here and she's out there.
she didn't tell you, did she?
ask her.
make her tell you all the dirty details.
I wonder what you'll think of her once you know.
I'm afraid I have some regrettable news.
your former doctor, Dr. Vega, tragically leapt to her death last night.
I'm very sorry.
your sister was the last person she spoke to.
the doctor said, "We've all got it coming.
what did she mean? I don't know.
you do know there are things in Sleepy Hollow that are not of this realm.
what do you think could have killed the doctor?
it's time to go. The Four Horsemen are coming.
you're a liar. The first is already here.
he beheaded Sheriff Corbin and Reverend Knapp before he fled from us.
you're not menteinsana, Miss Mills.
I don't believe you are. Neither does your sister.
if you mean what you say...
then you know there's not much I can do for you.
you already know what I do.
help us fight the Horsemen's army. Help you?
it's all over but the crying.
my conscience is clear.
ask Abbie if she can say the same.
lieutenant, please.
what's the cause of this rift between you and Miss Jenny?
I told you, it's complicated. I was born more than two centuries ago, and my wife is prisoner in some otherworldly realm.
I'm no stranger to complications. Miss Mills, stop.
what happened with you and your sister is between you and your sister.
but your secret is in the way of a truth we must uncover.
the consequences of keeping this secret could be dire.
I'm gonna trust you with something that I've never told anybody.
not a shrink, not a priest, not Sheriff Corbin.
when Jenny and I saw that thing in the woods...
I remember waking up.
felt like I'd only been asleep a few minutes.
apparently, it had been four days.
and the whole town had been looking for us.
what the...?
I found them! Hey, over here!
they asked a lot of questions I didn't want to answer.
someone else was in the woods. Can you describe him?
I told Jenny, "Don't say anything.
follow my lead. " She didn't listen.
a man...
come out of the ground.
she told him about what we saw???
she told him I saw it??
and that the rancher who found us saw it, too.
when she was done, the doctor turned to me.
did you see this... thing, as well?
no, I didn't see anything.
Abbie! - It's all right, Jenny.
she's lying!
I didn't see anything. - Why are you lying?
I'm not. I didn't see anything. - Why... Abbie. Tell them what you saw.
tell them what... Don't touch me!
tell them what you saw, Abbie!
tell them!
I told Jenny to keep her mouth shut about what we saw.
our parents were out of the picture, we finally landed in a decent foster home...
your parents were... "out of the picture.
that is a story for another day.
the point is, we would have been in enough trouble if they found out that we were in the woods sneaking beers after school.
but if we started talking about demons and all that, I told her we would be put back in the system.
so you said nothing. Like she should have.
and you were allowed to stay in the foster home while she was relocated.
you were afraid. You lied because you were afraid.
not only of the creature but of the earthly consequences of your tale.
but you do realize there's no need to be frightened still.
sorry? - You were frightened then, you still are today.
of what? - Of admitting the truth.
that you turned your back on Miss Jenny.
look, you're right.
what's between me and my sister is between me and my sister.
she told the doctor that you saw the demon, and the rancher who found you saw it as well.
Mr. Gillespie?
Yeah.
he never admitted to seeing anything.
probably because it would have cost him the 15 minutes of fame he got from being a small-town hero.
but he knew. He never told.
we should pay Mr. Gillespie a visit.
is that you?
who hung this in my office?
five people are dead, including two of your own.
and you think, just because you heard a rumor about a headless horseman running around town, it's all a big joke?
Yeah, it was me, sir. It's just a stupid prank.
you know, something we do when someone new joins the force.
good one.
morales, right? Yes, sir.
you used to date Lieutenant Mills. Yeah, how'd you know that, sir?
assume I know everything.
captain, we've got a report of shots fired at the Gillespie ranch on Pine Road.
tactical's en route. - Copy that.
if you need me, I'll be at the Gillespie ranch.
captain, what's going on?
what are you two doing here? I didn't call you.
seems our investigation has dovetailed with yours, sir.
what's going on?
we got a report of shots fired inside the house.
just pulled up. Found ourselves in a full-on hostage situation.
the suspect has his wife at gunpoint, won't talk to anybody.
I take it the suspect's name is Gillespie.
captain, Mr. Gillespie is asking to speak to a Lieutenant Mills.
this seems familiar. You got this?
I got it.
thank you.
lieutenant Mills is coming in. Copy that. In position.
Mr. Gillespie?
Mr. Gillespie?
it's Abigail Mills from the sheriff's department.
Mr. Gillespie.
Mr. Gillespie?
stay out. He's lost his mind.
Mr. Gillespie, you wanted to talk to me?
Mr. Gillespie, I'm here to help you.
let me help you.
you can't help me.
sure I can.
let's just talk.
send in tactical now!
stand by, Captain.
hold the team. - Stand down.
stand down. We're standing down.
we are just fine here, aren't we, Mr. Gillespie?
Mr. Gillespie?
you're gonna let me help you.
you can't help me.
he's coming for you next.
who is? Who's coming for me? The Sandman.
next time you fall asleep...
you're dead.
No!
is there a reason why you're standing alone?
far removed from everybody else? I'm trying to think.
you know, this isn't your fault either.
I know.
just wish I could've done something.
you did your best.
you were right about Jenny.
she's the key to all of this.
Dr. Vega, Mr. Gillespie, me.
none of us did anything to help her even though we knew she was telling the truth.
Mr. Gillespie said that I was next.
the next time I fell asleep... I'm dead.
the Sandman was coming to get me.
who's the Sandman? Really?
the, uh...
kindly dream giver who sprinkles sand in the eyes of children.
put 'em to sleep. Sounds barbaric.
what does the Sandman look like? I don't know.
the Sandman.
is he perhaps a-a... How did you put it?
faceless nightmare monster?
the one from my dream.
crane, I think I found something.
I requested coffee from the charwoman in the entrance hall, but she said you're particular to this beverage.
she's called a receptionist. Or Wendy.
and yes, I am.
it's an energy drink to help keep you awake.
it'll keep me awake.
potent.
I'm fine, I'm all right.
uh, so... you were saying? You have found something.
yes and no.
basically, dream spirits have been around as long as humans have been dreaming.
they're mostly easygoing types.
along the lines of the traditional Sandman.
but there's others.
less friendly. Vengeful types.
does this mean anything to you?
it's from an 18th century Mohawk story about a dream demon.
Ro'kenhrontyes. - You know him?
the creature in your nightmare, did he have black hollow eye sockets?
Yeah, he did. - And a veil of flesh where his mouth should be?
who is he? - A myth.
clearly one that's become all too real.
I first heard of it from the Mohawks who fought with us in the 37th regiment.
you fought alongside Native Americans?
fought, plotted, executed various forms of espionage.
many of our Mohawk friends were colonist spies.
they could infiltrate the ranks of the crown without anyone thinking twice about their presence.
they were invaluable to the cause.
they told me a fairy tale, a legend spun to frighten the young into a life of righteousness.
always do right by your neighbor, children, "or the spirit of Ro'kenhrontyes will come for you in your dreams.
native Americans would draw the symbol in the way we would make the sign of the cross to ward away evil.
Wiroh claimed that the dream spirit killed his father as punishment for turning a blind eye on his neighbor's plight.
so if this...
dream demon...
is responsible for Vega and Gillespie and is coming for me, what do I do?
I carve this symbol in my doorstep?
only if you believe crossing yourself will actually keep the Devil at bay.
look, I do not want to die because of something I did over ten years ago.
okay.
we must visit a Mohawk shaman.
that's easier said than done. - How so?
after the Revolution, the new government and the Native Americans fought over land.
there aren't very many of them left anymore. - How is that possible?
their nation stretched the continent.
their rules for governments formed the very basis of how we planned to unify 13 diverse states in a single federation.
they were my friends.
maybe this dream spirit has a long list of people to visit after he's done with me.
a shaman. Is there a place we can find one?
there is a guy.
I don't think it's what you're expecting.
the shaman sells motorized carriages.
trucks, motorcycles,
RVs, boats, a little bit of everything.
welcome to Geronimotors.
Seamus Duncan, owner, manager, and your humble servant.
lieutenant Abbie Mills.
this is my partner Ichabod Crane.
sheriff said I had 90 days to clean up the environmental waste in the back.
we're not here about that.
great. Hey.
you guys into time travel? I got a tricked-out DeLorean in mint condition.
we need your help... Combating the dream spirit.
Seriously?
you want me to go all kemosabe and cast a spell and do a rain dance? Get out of here, you jokers.
it's no joke.
we wouldn't be here if we weren't serious.
he has visited her.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you want to buy a car? I'm your man.
otherwise I can't help you.
you understood everything I said.
I recognized the fear in your countenance when I mentioned Ro'kenhrontyes.
he is coming for my friend. What will you do when he comes for you?
my conscience is clear.
his Honor Edmund Burke once said, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
and we may all at times stand idly when action is required.
but if you turn your back on Lieutenant Mills, how will you acquit yourself a good man when Ro'kenhrontyes comes to you in your dreams.
come on.
I don't know where you came from, but you can drop your "friend of the tribe" stick.
no one's a chief, no one lives in teepees, and no one has powwows.
got it?
you stopped having powwows?
I rather enjoyed those. - Get in.
where are we going? - We're taking a little trip.
first things first.
Ro'kenhrontyes isn't your run-of-the-mill demon.
there's run-of-the-mill demons? - Fair.
anyway, he doesn't just want to kill you.
he taunts you first.
he rubs your face in the mess you made.
he drives you to a pain so unimaginable, you willingly take your own life.
ergo... Dr. Vega and Mr. Gillespie.
and into the valley of death we go.
the good pass through on their way to Heaven. The evil go straight to Hell.
those in between, they belong to Ro'kenhrontyes.
if they're not redeemed, he takes their souls to Hell with him.
but I can't stop him? - Only on his territory.
you drink that tea, you enter his dreamworld.
then the fight begins.
down the hatch.
once you enter the dream worldthe spirit chooses the challenge you have to face.
you're a living being walking in the valley of death.
so...
if she dies in the dream? - She dies. Period.
I see.
jasmine.
cherry root.
hops?
not bad.
it's certainly preferable to your energy drink.
what are you thinking?
well, I'm coming with you now, so no point in discussing it.
the tea will put you to sleep.
the venom will allow you to control your actions while you dream.
it's the venom.
what-what venom?
their venom.
is this strictly necessary?
so you don't hurt yourselves. Scorpion stings...
they're, um...
Ouch.
you have to focus now.
once you enter the dreamworld, the tea will keep you connected.
but only you will know what you have to do to defeat Ro'kenhrontyes.
is that necessary, the banging?
lieutenant!
lieutenant!
you HAVE BEEN WEIGHED ON THE SCALES AND FOUND...
wanting
the imagination... It is, uh, it's a powerful thing, Jenny.
what you actually saw was-was likely an animal or a hunter.
what we saw was a demon!
tell him.
did you see this monster, Abbie?
Yes, she did.
tell him.
did YOU SEE HIM?
I've had this coming a long time.
we all have.
he's coming for you next.
tell them what you saw.
did YOU SEE THIS MONSTER?
I didn't see anything.
she's lying.
why are you lying?!
I didn't see anything! - Tell them what you saw! Abbie?
did YOU SEE THIS MONSTER?
why are you lying?!
tell them what you saw, Abbie!
don't touch me!
tell them what you saw!
Abbie, what's wrong with you?!
desist, Ro'kenhrontyes!
your SINS AREN'T MINE TO PUNISH.
leave her be!
stop!
I saw... a demon.
I saw a demon in the woods and I lied to protect myself.
I was a coward and I betrayed my sister.
I turned my back on her when she needed me.
and I will not do it again.
it was my fault. You can come at me all you want, but I see you.
I'm not afraid anymore!
lieutenant.
miss Mills? - I'm here.
how are you feeling?
better.
no more scorpions...
ever.
seven years of tribulation, huh?
according to scripture. - How long have we been doing this so far?
I'm certain it will become easier once we get accustomed to...
no, sorry, I'm too tired to lie.
stay as long as you want.
I have some unfinished business to take care of.
how'd you two get in here? - The old munitions tunnels.
I broke a wall.
why are you in here?
we thought it would be a good spot for us to do our work.
on the premises, but out the way.
good point.
I agree.
just don't break any more walls.
you want access to this place, I'll get you a key.
thank you, sir.
captain, would you like to discuss what the lieutenant and I discovered?
is it over? - Yes.
that's all I need to hear.
it's late. Go home.
get some sleep.
listen...
I'm not really good at this kind of thing, but I...
you're welcome.
you gotta let me get the words out, okay?
the things one most tries to hide are often the things most easily seen.
which is why I'll add, yes. you need to see your sister.
I am... way ahead of you.
like I was saying, unfinished business.
Godspeed. - Mm!
Abbie Mills to see Jennifer Mills.
her visitors log says she refused to see you.
I'm telling you, if she doesn't want to talk to you, she can be pretty stubborn.
she doesn't have to talk. She just has to listen.
Jenny? You have a visitor.
what the hell?
she was here at lights out. Where could she have gone?
these doors are electronically locked. We have people watching the ward.
there's no way out. - She found one.
get the administrator and lock the building down.
she's good.
Yes. Yes, yes.
I realize that your division has been trying very hard, but unfortunately, this isn't grammar school.
efforts don't count. You only get an "a" for results.
well, you know, if I give you more time, that will continue to reflect negatively on luthorcorp's balance sheets.
so I, um...
I wish you and your people much success with a less demanding company.
Yeah, well, thank you.
Hello, lionel.
Alex! What are you doing?!
sorry. Alex is a little busy right now.
what the hell are you doing? Who are you?
you're used to being in control.
if you want to regain it, you're going to have to play a little game.
the 11: 35 from smallville to metropolis is running on time.
win the game, or you'll be catching a ride the hard way.
what game?
hangman.
call out a letter. Guess the phrase.
lose the game, your life follows.
hurry, lionel. You'll only get an "a" for results.
Uh,"A." Too obvious.
lucky guess.
wrong again.
Um,"G." -Sorry.
s." -No.
would you like a hint?
it's a lesson I learned from you.
R," "y," "N." No mercy!
the answer is "no mercy"!
Lionel's at my house constantly, acting like he belongs there.
and from what you're telling me, it sounds like your mom kind of invited the wolf to come on in.
I know we've tiptoed through these tulips before, but what if you're wrong?
what if lionel doesn't know your secret?
the things he says to me, the look in his eye -- he knows.
then he's probably using your mom to get closer to you.
he's always there, helping her, offering advice.
she's trusting him more and more.
she wouldn't if she knew the truth.
I know I need to tell her. I was going to right after I found out.
so what stopped you?
she's been through so much...
since my dad died.
I don't want to give her one more thing to worry about.
well, by not telling her, you could be putting her at risk of a lot worse.
chess.
you haven't played chess in years.
why the sudden interest in such a complex game?
a friend of mine wants to learn the finer points.
I used to dismantle your two-dimensional assaults with alarming regularity, remember?
maybe you should teach your friend something a little less complicated.
what about a game of hangman? That's always fun.
Thanks.
I'll stick with chess.
you'll lose, as always.
I'm not playing to win.
I'm playing to instruct.
no mercy?
what are you talking about?
it was you, lex. I know it.
what?
disabling my limo in the path of an oncoming train.
that kind of melodrama went out of style with silent movies.
wait. Someone tried to kill you?
Oh, is this the part where you feign innocence?
I brought you in to help run luthorcorp again.
profits have never been higher. Why would i want you dead?
not so long ago, I tried to take luthorcorp away from you.
the apex takeover. -Right.
please.
seeing you fail miserably was retribution enough.
all right.
all right.
so it wasn't you.
I may not like you very much, dad, but you're a valuable asset to luthorcorp.
killing you would hurt the bottom line.
your concern is truly touching.
I am concerned.
a threat against you is a threat against luthorcorp.
I have been fending off attacks on my life since before you were born.
I think i can handle one more.
Oh, clark. What do you think about this as a closing?
it isn't enough to simply give when we can.
upholding the principles of truth, justice,"and the american way isn't a matter of convenience.
it's a matter of conscience.
sounds like words to live by.
let's hope the deep pockets at the civil liberties fund-raiser think so, too.
there's something I need to talk to you about.
can't it wait? I got to get to metropolis.
Lionel knows.
knows what?
Lionel knows about me.
about my secret. I don't know how.
I think I might.
a while ago, I found a package on our doorstep.
inside was a video of you surviving an explosion.
who sent it?
I'm not sure, but...
...lionel took care of it.
he said he wasn't interested in why i was being blackmailed. He just wanted to help.
and I believed him.
why didn't you tell me about this?
you were still in so much pain about your father.
I guess I...
I just wanted to protect you for a change.
Lionel's gonna be at this fund-raiser tonight.
when I see him -- -no, you can't say anything.
we have to handle this the same way dad would.
stick to our regular routine. Give nothing away. Not until we know what lionel's up to.
I better get going.
I'll go with you. -No, no.
if you start guarding me all the time, he'll definitely know something's up.
don't worry.
I can handle lionel.
Bye.
well, there are no concealed electronic devices here in the office anywhere.
sir, the office is clean.
I hope so, for your sake.
or you'll find yourself working in a convenience store, watching hot dogs spin.
thank you.
watching hot dogs spin?
that wasn't very nice.
but then again, that's the way you treat all the people who work for you, isn't it, lionel?
what do you do -- read lips?
I see everything.
Hello, lionel. How does it feel to be helpless?
I'll let you know if it ever happens.
now, that's that winning spirit that made you a billionaire.
let's see if it can keep you alive.
so...
what do you want?
I want to play another game.
hello again, lionel.
where am I?
in a hell of your own making.
who are you?
just another one of the many faceless people your greed has destroyed.
that narrows it down some, doesn't it?
you may not know me, lionel...
but I know you.
you're a man above it all...
commanding your workers to carry the burden of your empire.
they toil while you profit.
it's called running a business!
that's how it works!
not anymore.
now you're gonna have to get your own hands dirty.
bright, isn't it?
Oh, well, now. What do we have here?
take a closer look.
go on.
not exactly springwater, is it?
a good story always needs a hook, wouldn't you agree?
all right. So what happens now?
now we're gonna play another game.
would you like to see how it's played?
Yeah. Show me.
these are the scales of justice.
fill the buckets with the liquid from the tap and balance them on the pole.
succeed, and the door to this room will open.
Alex, he didn't do too well.
did I forget to mention that the liquid is flammable?
he was my driver. An innocent man.
no one connected to you is innocent.
ready to play? -No.
no. Lionel luthor doesn't jump through hoops.
in 10 minutes, flames beneath your feet will consume this room.
balance the scales or burn for your sins.
take your time.
the key to mastering chess is to anticipate your opponent's moves and keep him on the defensive.
Lex, what are we doing?
I thought we were enjoying an evening of chess.
I think I have monopoly.
you know what I'm talking about.
we've spent the last week avoiding what happened.
I was kind of waiting for you to bring that up.
you kissed me.
and then you kissed me back.
God, after all that talk about friendship and not wanting to ruin what we have...
we really don't listen very well, do we?
are you asking me to forget what happened?
because short of a serious blow to the head, I think it's a memory that's gonna linger for quite a while.
you should get that. I'm gonna go back to metropolis.
I'll call you later.
what?
get a security team and meet me at luthorcorp plaza, and keep this internal.
I don't want anyone to know my father's missing.
getting a little warm?
how does it feel
the flames licking at your heels, every step blistering pain?
I'll bet a pair of those $1, 000 italian shoes you favor would really make a difference right about now, wouldn't they?
I understand how hard it must be for a man who's not used to breaking a sweat.
I grew up in suicide slum. Sweat's something I'm very familiar with, my friend.
I know all about your underprivileged youth, but that all changed when your parents died in the fire you set.
did I hit a nerve?
I didn't kill my parents.
tell a lie long enough, you'll believe it to be truth.
you're running out of time.
do want to tell me what you've learned from this game before the flesh is seared from your bones?
Yeah. You talk too much.
shut up.
careful.
remember what happened to your limo driver.
the scales of justice are hard to balance with blood on your hands, aren't they?
congratulations on your acquittal.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
what? Another game?
Yes.
but this time, you're going to need a partner...
...someone to help you through the dark times.
Martha!
Lionel, please!
Don'T...don'T...
don't panic!
Martha. -Lionel, what's going on?!
someone is playing a very sick game.
who?! -I don't know.
how did you get here? -I don't know.
I was in the parking structure at the plaza, and I
I heard this noise behind me. I don't know. Please get us out!
all right. All right. Martha, stand back.
all right! She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go!
she has everything to do with this.
you use your wealth to buy influence, controlling the halls of power.
you're the man in the shadows pulling all the strings.
and your puppets -- they're as guilty as the master.
and they deserve a similar fate.
all right. All right, so what's this game? How do I get her out, huh?
you use words as weapons, twisting them to your purpose, obscuring truth with double meaning.
now it's my turn.
a toad like fever"? I don't understand this.
shift your perceptions.
Shift...your...
her life is in your hands.
what? No, wait, wait! I need more.
I understand the whole acting normal thing, but ferreting out the truth is acting normal for me.
Chloe...you're not the only one lionel's been playing.
he fed me information about fine being in honduras because he knew i'd come to you with it.
why don't you let me use that as an in, to find out what he's really up to?
what if he finds out what you're up to?
it's too risky.
Oh, and waiting for darth luthor to hatch his evil plan isn't?
Hey, lois.
no. She left hours ago.
all right, I'll let you know if I hear anything.
what is it?
my mom never showed up at the fund-raiser in metropolis.
Oh, my god.
pull the security vids for the last 24 hours.
see if you can find anything else unusual.
Yes, sir.
it's okay.
Clark, what are you doing here?
looking for your father. -Where is he?
I wish I knew.
he's missed a couple of meetings and never showed up for a fund-raiser at the plaza.
neither did my mother.
Lex, if you have any idea what's going on, you better tell me right now.
Clark, earlier today my father accused me of orchestrating some bizarre attempt on his life.
you think someone's giving it a second shot?
all I know is that he was taken from this office.
how do you know that?
I found his cellphone on the floor.
the last call he tried to make was to 911.
the time stamp on it matches an unexplained gap in the building security tapes.
what about the cameras in here?
there aren't any.
my father liked to have a place where he could conduct certain transactions without any electronic records.
would that be the less-than-legal kind?
Lex...
has this always been chipped like that?
my father wouldn't tolerate a flaw in his prized collection.
nice catch.
this isn't your standard issue.
this was homemade by somebody who really knew what they were doing.
high res, wireless carrier...
is it transmitting? -No, it's powered down.
but if we juice it up, I might be able to piggyback the transmission and trace where it's located.
let's try it.
a toad like fever"!
fever. It doesn'T... it doesn't make any sense.
it has to mean something.
have you ever heard it before? -No.
wait.
why aren't they all the same?
what? -The first letters of the words.
the "t" and the "f" are capitals, but not the "a" at the beginning and the "l" in "like.
T," "F." Right, right. He said it was a --what did he say?
he said it was uh...shift -- shift -- shift your perception!
it's an anagram. It's an anagram... where the true meaning is scrambled
a word puzzle! -A word puzzle!
it's transmitting on a rotational code.
I'll see if I can hack the sequence and locate the termination point.
hurry.
it's a shame, isn't it?
takes a crisis like this to get us in the same room together.
look, clark, maybe when this is all over, we can try to find our way back to some common ground.
excuse me. I got to take this.
is there anything I can do to make this go faster?
not unless computer skills are one of your abilities.
signal's strong, minimal degradation, which means it must be local.
got it. 8320 vermont avenue. Five miles from here.
great.
find something?
an address not far from here.
great. Take my porsche. It's a lot faster than your truck.
let's go.
V," "I," "L." "Evil." "To dare fake evil.
it's gibberish. -There's meaning in it -- there has to be!
no. There'S...
you want me to fail, don't you? You want me to watch her die?!
is that what you want?! -Lionel!!
he wants me to fail. To...fail.
fail. Fail.
fail. He said the truth is obscured with double meaning.
double. Double meaning. No mercy.
Uh...greed. Grab. Take.
take, take, take. Take, take, Do take.
Over...takeover. Failed takeover!
failed takeover! The answer is "failed takeover!
failed takeover!
apex. Apex! Apex!
it's apex.
Martha.
Martha.
Martha.
you're all right.
it's all right.
genuine concern for another human being?
I suspected your relationship with the senator was more than just political.
all right.
Martha.
all right, we won your game. Now let us out.
as you wish.
come on, Martha.
wait, wait. Wait.
what's up here? -Freedom...
...or death, depending on the outcome of your final game.
you expect us to walk right into another trap?
you could stay right where you are and wait for the floor to be electrified.
come on!
what happens now? -I don't know.
No!
I'm sorry that you got dragged into this.
dragged into what? Who is that man?
I don't know.
Apex? A failed takeover? What does that mean?
apex group was an asian consortium.
I used it to try to take back control of luthorcorp from lex.
Lex found out and made a very compelling argument for me to pull out.
apex funded hundreds of companies. Investors were ruined.
a lot of people lost everything. -Because of you. Because of your greed.
no. This wasn't about me. This was about lex.
Lex?
about hurting him? You hate him that much?
I was trying to teach him, martha, lessons. Hard lessons.
I thought that if I removed the temptations that power and money gave him, maybe then he would be able to rediscover his own humanity.
did you ever think of just talking to him, father to son?
that might work in the kent family, but lex is not clark, and...
...I'm not the father jonathan kent was.
it's never too late to change.
unless you're dead.
Lionel luthor, you've destroyed so many lives without consideration, all to win your own games.
let's see if you can do the same when the life in the balance is someone you so obviously care about.
one bullet.
kill senator kent -- win your freedom.
or she kills you. Winner goes free.
No!
we're not playing any more games.
there's an explosive charge attached to the elevator cable above your head.
if one if you isn't dead in two minutes, you both lose.
your decision.
Clark, how close are you?
we're in the building.
I think we found it. Hold on.
you want to wait for the security team?
no.
me neither.
Chloe...
there's no one here.
they must have re-routed the signal in case we found the camera.
Clark.
mom.
I'm sorry, martha.
please forgive me.
only one of us is gonna walk out of here.
Lionel -- -no, don't talk.
take it.
you're good, martha.
so many people depend on you...
especially clark.
and we both know that he
what a special boy he is.
and now, because jonathan's gone, he's going to need you more than ever to become the man this world so desperately needs.
do it.
and go home to your son.
I can'T.
I'd hoped that...
I'd always hoped that things would end differently with us, martha.
don't blame yourself.
your life is truly important.
No!
Chloe? What happened?
the feed was terminated at the source. I'm trying to back-trace the location.
the signal's bouncing all over the place, trying to throw us off.
a selfless act from lionel luthor.
life is full of surprises.
so is death.
you son of a
I got it. They're somewhere across town.
where?
it's gonna take a minute to narrow it down. Start heading west.
I'll guide you in.
Clark, we should
there's no escaping, lionel.
the charges have been primed.
one more touch of a button, and the luthorcorp empire mourns its founder.
you were never gonna let us go, were you?
you're the master manipulator, lionel. You should know that some games are rigged.
why didn't you just kill me?
because I wanted to watch you suffer like I did.
you're...you're the...
I stood right in front of you today. You didn't even know who I was.
you didn't see the house I lost...
the wife...
children.
an entire life gone because of your little game with apex.
I'm no one.
just another piece of lionel luthor's collateral damage.
this is between me...
and you.
let her go.
does it hurt, lionel?
knowing you're gonna watch her die?
the one person you would have sacrificed your life for.
let her go.
this is my fault.
all of it.
I'm sorry.
that's all I wanted to hear.
That...was...
...miraculous.
thank you...
son.
Oh, sweetie, thank you.
you're sure you're okay?
I got some bumps and bruises, but I'll live.
no thanks to lionel.
what happened was the work of a very disturbed man.
Lionel's no saint, but this wasn't his fault.
maybe not directly.
he was willing to sacrifice himself for your future.
Lionel never does anything that doesn't benefit him in the end.
we can't trust him.
if we want to protect your secret, we might not have a choice.
Lincoln cole.
that was the name of the man who did all this.
you found him.
in a bar around the block.
he was toasting your demise.
didn't care if he was caught, as long as you were dead.
the authorities had to sedate him when he found out you weren'T.
powerful men, son.
we attract the occasional lunatic.
it wasn't insanity that drove him to that, dad.
it was you.
we all make mistakes, son.
and yours almost cost martha kent her life.
well, I'm just thankful the elevator safety brake slowed us down enough to survive the fall.
Yeah.
you should be.
especially since cole disabled them.
that's enough to make a man believe in miracles.
isn't it, son?
I, uh, don't suppose clark had anything to do with that divine intervention.
Clark...
I heard what you said over the video...
about what a special boy he is.
What'd you mean by that?
I meant that...
...he's the kind of son a father could be proud of.
one minute he's standing in the same room with me...
...and the next, he's across town.
you're still obsessing over him after all these years.
Clark kent's a simple farm boy.
let it go, lex.
let it go.
I've been expecting you...
Kal-El.
how long have you known?
from the moment I held in my hand the crystal that helped to form your fortress of solitude.
the one that put you in a coma.
coma?
I'd like to think of it as A...
a state of...
contemplative repose.
you've known my secret for almost a year.
Yes.
why haven't you done anything?
what? Expose you to the world?
some strange visitor from another planet?
I've tried to tell you -- I am not your enemy.
to reveal your secret would change your destiny.
and it would harm someone i care about very deeply.
you had a choice...
to kill my mother or to kill yourself.
I could never harm your mother. There was no choice.
Yeah.
unless you knew the gun wasn't loaded.
you have no reason to believe anything I say. I realize that.
but I hope eventually you will come to trust me.
I only want what's best for you and your mother...
son.
you don't call me that.
jonathan kent was my father.
no. I'm not trying to take his place.
you couldn'T.
my mother seems to think there may be some good in you, but I'm not so sure.
it takes time, clark.
maybe you will be.
or maybe you'll just show your true colors.
secret or no secret, you stay away from my mother, or you'll wish i never saved your life.
you SAVED ME.
well, THAT WAS THE LAST TIME.
the BURNING SUN MAY STRENGTHEN YOU,
but IT HAS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT ON ME.
it STRIPPED ME OF MY POWERS.
detective JOHN JONES.
I WANTED TO BE CLOSE BY IN CASE YOU NEEDED ME.
does CLARK KNOW ABOUT YOU?
I THINK I CAN SAFELY SAY HE KNOWS MORE OF MY SECRETS THAN HE DOES YOURS.
you WEREN'T PLANNING ON COMING BACK, WERE YOU?
Mr. LUTHOR IS A FIRM BELIEVER IN TRUTH AND JUSTICE.
he's DONE MORE FOR THIS WORLD THAN YOU EVER WILL.
he DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO MAKING IT A SAFER PLACE.
dispatch, THIS IS DETECTIVE JONES.
please TELL ME YOU HAVE A 20 ON MY SUSPECT.
suspect was just spotted turning north on Riverside.
black-and-white in pursuit.
you're UNDER ARREST FOR THREE COUNTS OF MURDER.
thank FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE, OFFICERS.
just DOING OUR JOB, DETECTIVE.
this ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND WHEN I SUGGESTED COFFEE AFTER WORK.
after WORK?
Oh, LANA, WHAT TIME IS IT? -RELAX.
it GIVES ME A CHANCE TO SEE CLARK KENT IN HIS NEW ELEMENT.
shirt AND TIE -- YOU MUST BE TURNING HEADS LEFT AND RIGHT.
I GUESS I'VE BEEN TOO BUSY AT WORK TO NOTICE.
you KNOW, WITH EVERYTHING ELSE GOING ON...
any LEADS ON THAT THING THAT TOOK CHLOE?
a NIGHT WATCHMAN AND TWO AMBULANCE DRIVERS WERE MURDERED THE NIGHT OF THE CEREMONY.
Lana, I'M GONNA FIND THIS THING BEFORE IT HURTS ANYONE ELSE.
I KNOW YOU WILL.
you've BECOME THE MAN THAT I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN YOU COULD BE.
I SHOULD PROBABLY LEAVE YOU TO IT.
UM...NEXT ROUND'S ON YOU.
emergency staff to the E. R.
incoming trauma, Metropolis P. D.
G. S.W. TO THE CHEST.
B. P. IS CRITICAL. HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.
he's ALIVE, BUT WE CAN'T GET A PULSE.
all RIGHT, I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.
no ONE IN OR OUT WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION.
clearing THE WOUND. B. P. IS DROPPING.
we've GOT TO GET THE BULLET OUT -- NOW!
charge THE PADDLES. WE'RE LOSING HIM. CLEAR!
Oliver? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS OUT ON PATROL.
I HEARD THE CALL GO OUT OVER MY SCANNER.
whoever THAT IS, HE CAN'T JUST OPERATE ON JONES.
Why? 'CAUSE HE'S MARTIAN?
I GET IT, CLARK. IT'S FINE.
he's IN GOOD HANDS WITH EMIL. TRUST ME.
after I GOT POISONED, I FIGURED,
you KNOW, GUYS LIKE US COULD PROBABLY USE A SPECIALIST ON THE PAYROLL.
since WHEN DID JONES BECOME ONE OF US?
well, HE'S GOTTEN ME OUT OF A FEW TIGHT SCRAPES WITH THE POLICE, CLARK.
he WANTED TO MEET WITH ME AFTER HIS SHIFT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.
if HE HADN'T SACRIFICED HIS ABILITIES TO SAVE MY LIFE,
that BULLET WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT A SCRATCH.
and NOW YOU FEEL GUILTY,
and THAT'S YOUR THING, AND I GET IT -- THAT'S GREAT.
but STANDING HERE DOING NOTHING IS NOT GONNA SOLVE ANYTHING.
do YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS WORKING ON?
no.
I THINK YOU SHOULD FOLLOW YOUR LEADS.
and I'LL FOLLOW MINE.
Hey, LET'S FACE IT.
teamwork's NEVER REALLY BEEN OUR STRONG SUIT.
what IS YOUR FOCUS?
true VICTORY.
and WHAT IS TRUE VICTORY?
victory OVER ONE'S SELF.
first PRINCIPLE OF AIKIDO.
that'll BE ALL, TERRENCE.
the ENIGMATIC LANA LANG.
in THE FLESH.
to WHAT DO I OWE THIS HONOR?
I WANTED TO THANK YOU.
there's BEEN A STARTLING LACK OF COVERAGE ON MY RETURN IN THE DAILY PLANET.
I TEND TO KEEP MY REPORTERS ON A SHORT LEASH.
Mm. MOST OF THE TIME.
you HAVE JUST AS MUCH PRESENCE...AS LEX SAID YOU DID.
you'd HAVE TO TO TAME A LUTHOR.
high MARKS...
coming FROM THE WOMAN ENTRUSTED WITH THE LUTHOR LEGACY.
he MUST HAVE HAD A LOT OF FAITH IN YOU.
it WASN'T EASY TO EARN.
I WONDER HOW MUCH OF THAT TRUST WOULD REMAIN
if HE KNEW HOW MUCH OF HIS COMPANY'S MONEY YOU WERE SIPHONING INTO A PROJECT CALLED PROMETHEUS.
unless, OF COURSE,
there's STILL SOMEONE HIGHER THAN YOU CALLING THE SHOTS.
Lex IS ALIVE.
and YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS, DON'T YOU?
seems THAT YOU'VE BEEN WASTING A VERY GIFTED IMAGINATION, MS. LANG.
the PLANET RUNS A FICTION SECTION ON SUNDAYS, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.
I USED TO SEE THAT LOOK IN THE MIRROR.
you'll DO ANYTHING TO DEFEND LEX, TO PROTECT HIM.
he HAS A WAY OF TURNING THAT KIND OF DEVOTION AGAINST YOU.
well, YOU DON'T KNOW LEX LIKE I DO.
for YOUR SAKE, I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.
glad I CAUGHT YOU BEFORE YOU LEFT.
Yeah, I JUST NEED TO BE BACK AT THE HOSPITAL BEFORE JIMMY WAKES UP.
I WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED
heroes DON'T TAKE HOLIDAYS.
so, FROM WHAT I CAN HACK, IT LOOKS LIKE OUR FAVORITE MARTIAN HAS BEEN PULLING PROFILES
from A HANDFUL OF OFFICERS FROM THE 44th PRECINCT.
you KNOW, I GOT TO SAY,
being AT THE MERCY OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY REALLY SUCKS.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'm HAPPY TO BE BRAINIAC-FREE.
but MY EVIL UPGRADE WAS REALLY...CONVENIENT.
I'm JUST GLAD EVERYTHING'S BACK TO NORMAL.
so IT WOULD SEEM.
how ARE THINGS NOW THAT LANA'S BACK IN YOUR ORBIT?
it's NOT LIKE THAT.
I THINK.
Clark, WHEN YOU START THROWING AROUND THE CLARKLANA TRIANGLE.
and I'M SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE WHEN I SAY THAT THE THIRD POINT ALWAYS HURTS.
I'm NOT TRYING TO HURT ANYONE.
how ABOUT LOIS?
Yeah. IT'S THAT OBVIOUS.
Lois IS SO...
Yeah.
seeing LANA COME BACK, IT'S LIKE SHE NEVER LEFT.
can't JUST STOP LOVING SOMEONE JUST LIKE THAT, RIGHT?
I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR CLOSURE, CLARK.
just PROMISE YOU'RE NOT GONNA SLAM MY COUSIN IN THE DOOR.
ballistics SAYS IT'S A BG-49 ARMOR-PIERCING BULLET.
which MYSTERIOUSLY VANISHED FROM THE EVIDENCE.
Clark, YOU SAID YOU RETURNED THAT, DIDN'T YOU?
I DID, CHLOE.
you SAID JONES WAS LOOKING INTO THE 44th.
only SOMEONE FROM THAT SYSTEM COULD HAVE STOLEN THE EVIDENCE.
Chloe, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AN INSIDE JOB.
you THINK JONES WAS SHOT BY A COP.
if THAT'S THE CASE, THEN SOMEONE HIGHER UP IN THE FORCE NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS.
and YOU THINK SOMEONE ON THE FORCE IS JUST GONNA OPEN UP TO YOU, A REPORTER?
Clark, THESE GUYS PROTECT THEIR OWTH ??
jones IS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE.
I'm NOT GONNA LET WHOEVER DID THIS HIDE BEHIND THEIR BADGE.
all RIGHT.
if WE'RE GONNA SNEAK YOU ACROSS THIS THIN BLUE LINE,
you're GONNA NEED SOMETHING A LOT MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN JUST A PRESS PASS.
Danny BOY.
you ALL SET FOR YOUR NEW SIDEKICK?
he WAS BORN READY.
besides, WHO CAN RESIST THIS HANDSOME FACE?
better THAN LOOKING AT HIS UGLY MUG ALL DAY.
give 'EM HELL, DANNY!

I THINK ROOT BEER IS THE ONLY ONE WORTH THE EFFORT.
help YOURSELF.
what's THE MATTER, FOREMAN?
don't THEY HAVE SQUAD CARS BACK IN COVE CITY?
I JUST -- I GUESS I'M NOT USED TO RIDING IN ONE SO NICE.
nice?
good TO SEE YOU GOT A SENSE OF HUMOR.
you're GONNA NEED THAT HERE.
let's JUST HOPE YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH THAT SURF AGAIN.
it WAS A DETECTIVE THAT GOT SHOT, RIGHT?
what's HIS NAME? JONES?
Yeah, WELL, THAT MIGHT BE A HEADLINE BACK WHERE YOU COME FROM,
but HERE, SOME DETECTIVE GETTING PLUGGED IS JUST ANOTHER DAY IN METROPOLIS.
blood ON A BADGE IS BLOOD ON A BADGE, RIGHT?
no MATTER WHAT CITY YOU'RE IN.
wearing THIS BADGE IS LIKE PUTTING A BULL'S-EYE RIGHT OVER YOUR HEART.
meanwhile, WE GOT THESE COSTUMED IDIOTS RUNNING AROUND,
getting IN OUR WAY, TAKING ALL THE CREDIT.
the GREEN ARROW, RED-BLUE BLUR?
great PUMPKIN.
Yeah.

it's GOOD TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE'S STILL GOT HIS BACK OUT THERE.
how LONG DID THEY RIDE TOGETHER?
since THEY GRADUATED THE ACADEMY.
one DAY THEY BOTH WENT OUT AND ONLY DANNY CAME HOME.
Mike ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS BULLETPROOF.
now EVERY NIGHT, I HOLD MY BREATH,
waiting FOR HIM TO WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR.
we JUST NEED HIM MORE.

rookie REALLY EARNED HIS KEEP TODAY.
and TO US.
we ALL MADE IT HOME SAFE.
may WE ALL BE AS LUCKY TOMORROW.
excuse ME.
it's TOO BAD ALL OF US WEREN'T SO LUCKY.
you KNOW, WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH JONES.
Yeah.
Yeah, YOU KNOW, THE DAMN SHAME IS, NOBODY KNEW THE GUY.
ask ANYONE IN THIS PRECINCT.

and THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING.
safety IN NUMBERS?
well, I WASN'T MAKING LIGHT WHEN I SAID WE'RE ALL BROTHERS.

and YOU LEAVE THE DETECTIVE WORK TO THE DESK JOCKEYS.
don't BE STUPID LIKE JONES. ALWAYS WEAR YOUR VEST.
Foreman, WE GOT TO GO.
I GUESS I'M NOT AS GOOD A JUDGE OF CHARACTER AS I THOUGHT.
it SEEMS THAT YOU STOLE SOME SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM ME.
and I THOUGHT WE WERE BONDING.
rain CHECK ON GIRLS' NIGHT?
you KNOW, IT'S NICE TO FINALLY SEE WHAT LEX SAW IN YOU.
you're STUNNING.
and DEVIOUS.
what LEX SAW IN ME WAS AN EQUAL,
someone THAT HE COULDN'T CONTROL.
Really?
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T SEND MY CONDOLENCES ABOUT THE MISCARRIAGE, THEN, HMM?
it GAVE ME THE PERSPECTIVE I NEEDED TO SEE LEX FOR WHO HE REALLY IS.
I KNOW HE THOUGHT TH THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP YOU.
but HE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.
when YOU STOLE THE DATA,
you CORRUPTED OUR FILES, AND WE'VE LOST EVERYTHING.
Prometheus IS THE ONE CHANCE LEX HAS AT SURVIVAL,
and I WON'T LET YOU JEOPARDIZE THAT.
got YOU A LITTLE PRESENT, DANNY.
look WHO SURFACED.

I'm SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I'm...Sorry.

Clark, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
you GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE -- NOW!
were YOU THIS DEVOTED BEFORE OR AFTER YOUR ACCIDENT?
someone's BEEN DOING HER HOMEWORK.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME.
two YEARS AGO, YOUR SURVEY TEAM WAS IN SOUTH AMERICA,
collecting DISEASE SAMPLES FOR LUTHORCORP
when AN EXPLOSION DESTROYED YOUR CAMP.
and YOU WERE LEFT FOR DEAD.
Lex SAVED MY LIFE.
I OWE HIM EVERYTHING.
this IS HOW A LUTHOR REWARDS THAT KIND OF LOYALTY.
what ARE YOU DOING?
I'm OPENING YOUR EYES.
there's A NANOTRANSMITTER HARDWIRED TO YOUR OPTIC NERVE.
you've BEEN LEX'S EYES AND EARS FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
he's WATCHING US RIGHT NOW.
Lex MIGHT HAVE SAVED YOU, BUT HE NEVER TRUSTED YOU, TESS.
I'm SORRY.
I'll LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS DETECTIVE JONES WAKES UP.
he's STRONG, BUT HE'S NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET.
thank YOU, DOCTOR.
take IT EASY. -TAKE IT EASY?! COME HERE.
I SAW YOU CHATTING UP YOUR BUDDY THE GREEN ARROW.
he TOOK DOWN OUR WHOLE SQUAD, AND YOU JUST LET HIM WALK.
look, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK YOU SAW
all YOU DO IS ASK QUESTIONSABOUT SOME ??
and THEN I FIND YOU CHECKING UP ON HIM IN THE HOSPITAL, TOO?
who ARE YOU, JOE? YOU FED? I. A.B?
I WANT TO TAKE DOWN THE GUY WHO SHOT HIM,
and I KNOW THAT THE SHOOTER'S A PART OF YOUR SQUAD.
they CROSSED THE LINE, DANNY.
this ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE GONE AFTER SOMEBODY
who SLIPPED THROUGH THE SYSTEM.
someone HAS TO. -WHAT ABOUT JOHN JONES?
he WAS ON TO YOUR LITTLE LYNCH MOB, WASN'T HE?
Danny, SOMEONE SHOT HIM TO COVER IT UP.
who ARE YOU PROTECTING?
you DON'T ROLL OVER ON A BADGE. NOT EVER.
then WHY IS IT OKAY TO SHOOT ONE?
Hey, THESE GUYS HAVE MY BACK.
W-WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR YOU.
I DO HAVE YOUR BACK, DANNY, AND I MIGHT BE THE ONLY ONE.
this IS NOT JUSTICE.
Joe, I'M JUST ONE MAN.
what CAN ONE MAN DO?
ask YOURSELF WHY YOU PUT THAT UNIFORM ON IN THE FIRST PLACE.
imagine MY SURPRISE WHEN I STUMBLE UPON METROPOLIS' FINEST GOING GANGLAND.
thug's A REALLY GOOD LOOK FOR YOU AND YOUR CREW, BY THE WAY.
they're NOT ALL BAD, OLIVER.
some OF THEM ARE OUT THERE EVERY DAY,
risking THEIR LIVES AND THEIR FAMILIES,
trying TO DO THE SAME THING WE ARE.
Yeah, I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.
you KNOW, I ALWAYS FORGET
how MANY PAROLEES DID WE ROUGH UP LAST MONTH? DO YOU REMEMBER?
of ALL PEOPLE, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ISN'T JUST BLACK AND WHITE.
no MATTER HOW NOBLE THEIR INTENTIONS WHEN THEY STARTED,
Clark, THESE PEOPLE HAVE GONE TOO FAR.
and YOU NEVER HAVE?
Danny WATCHED THAT GUY KILL HIS PARTNER.
tell ME YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TEMPTED TO LOOK IN THE EYES OF SOMEONE WHO JUST COMMITTED SO MUCH PAIN AND J
kill HIM.
kill HIM FOR THE GREATER GOOD?
you GONNA STAND THERE D TELLE THAT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE?
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
what I'M SAYING IS THAT SAVING SOMEONE, TRULY SAVING THEM,
is NOT ABOUT KNOCKING THEM OUT AND THROWING THEM IN A DARK ROOM.
it's ABOUT HELPING THEM FIND THEIR W BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE.
you KNOW WHAT, CLARK? SOME PEOPLE ARE BEYOND SAVING.
that's THE SUSPECT THAT JONES TRACKED DOWN LAST NIGHT.
but HE DIDN'T FIND HISAY BACK TO CTODY, CLARK.
he DID, HOWEVER, MANAGE TO FIND HIS WAY TO THE BOTTOM OF A RIVER.
now, THESE PEOPLE ARE TAKING THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.
how MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING?
all RIGHT, LOOK. I HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN TO SIMMONS AND TALBERT.
both HAVE SNIPER TRAINING. -GREAT!
you SIT HERE AND YOU PLAY DETECTIVE.
I'm GONNA GO MAKE SURE YOUR BOYS DON'T GET A CHANCE
to PUT ANOTHER PERSON IN THE HOSPITAL.
what's THE MATTER?
there's SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT JOE.
I MADE A COUPLE CALLS.
he's NOT WHO HE SAYS HE IS.
could HAVE CALLED AHEAD.
I WOULD'VE HAD THE WIFE SET A PLACE AT THE TABLE FOR YOU.
?? CLARK KENT, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF DETECTIVE JOHN JONES.
you SET ME UP?
you're BETTER THAN THIS.
you DID THE RIGHT THING.
just ONE LOOSE THREAD TO TIE UP.
your HANDS HAVE BEEN CLEAN FOR WAY TOO LONG, DANNY BOY.
Hey, SMILE.
you're GONNA BE THE MAN WHO KILLED THE GREEN ARROW.
this IS MESSED UP.
you SAID YOU WERE TRANSFERRING ME.
we're NOT GONNA KILL YOU. YOU'RE JUST THE BAIT.
you ready, Danny?
how YOU KNOW THE ARROW'S GONNA SHOW?
he can't help himself.
after THE OTHER NIGHT, YOU CAN BET HE'S BEEN WATCHING US.
help! HELP! HELP!
somebody HELP ME!
that SHOULD DO IT. LET HIM HAVE IT.
target spotted, moving toward your position.
showtime, KID.
??
you're WELCOME.
damn IT, TURPIN, MOVE IN.
turn AROUND. SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.
that's NOT BAD.
it's NOT EVERY DAY SOMEONE GETS THE DROP ON ME.
is THIS ALL A JOKE TO YOU?
that GUY TOOK A SHOT AT ME.
and YOU WERE GONNA WHAT? PUT HIM IN THE GROUND?
damn IT, TURPIN, YOU GOT THE SHOT. TAKE IT.
you're JOE'S PARTNER, RIGHT?
his NAME IS CLARK KENT.
this ISN'T ABOUT HIM, OKAY?
you got the shot, Danny. come on, Take it.
it's NOT TOO LATE FOR YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
why DON'T YOU CAPES JUST MIND YOUR OWN DAMN BUSINESS, HUH?!
you DON'T KNOW THESE GUYS LIKE I DO.
I GOT A FAMILY AT HOME.
and WHEN YOUR LITTLE BOY ASKS YOU WHO YOU SAVED TODAY,
you CAN TELL HIM YOU KILLED A MAN IN COLD BLOOD.
it AIN'T LIKE THAT.
I KNEW YOU WERE A PART OF THIS, BUT CLARK ACTUALLY TRUSTED YOU.
he THINKS YOU JUST LOST YOUR WAY.
take the shot! DANNY.
man, IF THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO FIND YOURSELF, THEN...
...then DO IT.
you DO IT. YOU PULL THE TRIGGER, AND YOU CAN PROVE CLARK WRONG.
be A REAL HERO.
take THE SHOT, DANNY.
you SHOULD HAVE PULLED THAT TRIGGER, KID.
dispatch...
green ARROW SPOTTED ON 16th AVENUE ASSAULTING AN OFFICER.
requesting BACKUP. OFFICER IS DOWN.
all units, all units.
10-108 on 16th.
officer under attack from Green Arrow.
immediate backup requested.
how MANY TIMES DID I SWEAR TURPIN WOULDN'T SEAL THE DEAL?
pay UP.
?? COME ON. LET'S GO.
what THE...
how DID... HOW DID YOU...
it's LIKE YOU SAID.
always WEAR A VEST.
Danny... -YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
don't SHOOT!
I'm ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.
Hey.
Hey.
feels GOOD ?? TO BE BACK ON MY FEET AGAIN.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FAVORS YOU HAD TO CALL IN.
thank YOU FOR GETTING ME OUT OF TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE.
it WAS THE LEAST I COULD DO.
could HAVE USED SOME BACKUP OUT THERE.
why DIDN'T YOU CALL ME IN SOONER?
same REASON I'VE HAD TO PULL YOU FROM THE BRINK OF DEATH BEFORE.
same REASON YOU LET YOUR GUARD DOWN LAST NIGHT.
pride.
after KNOWING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TRULY FEEL POWERFUL...
to HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE FATE...
it's HARD TO ADMIT WHEN YOU CAN'T DO IT ALONE.
I GUESS GOING SOLO HAS REALLY CAUGHT UP WITH US LATELY, HUH?
you KNOW, FOR EVERYTHING DANNY'S CREW DID WRONG,
I HAVE TO SAY...
knowing THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE THERE WHO HAS YOUR BACK...
that KIND OF BROTHERHOOD CAN MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU COULD DO ANYTHING.
when I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS OVER,
you GAVE ME A REASON TO KEEP GOING.
I WOULDN'T BE WHO I AM WITHOUT YOU.
I TRUSTED YOU.
because I RESPECTED YOU.
I've DONE EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER ASKED.
you've SEEN THAT WITH YOUR OWN EYES,
and APPARENTLY WITH MINE.
but NOT ANYMORE.
I HOPE YOU WATCH WITH RAPT ATTENTION
as YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS CLOSE,
as YOU LOSE ALL CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD,
as YOUR LIFE DISAPPEARS BEFORE YOUR EYES.
goodbye, LEX.
I LOVED YOU.
you SON OF A BITCH.
mercy.
Wow.
sure HOPE YOUR S'MORES ARE WORTH THE DRIVE.
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO SPOIL YOUR APPETITE.
we're GOING TO DINNER.
I'd LIKE TO DISCUSS A MERGER.
a MERGER?
what KIND OF MERGER?
any KIND YOU WANT.
don't KEEP ME WAITING.
Oh!
all RIGHT, BUD. IT'S P. J. TIME, OKAY?
green ARROW?
no.
Robin HOOD.
you KNOW, MOST PEOPLE THINK HE'S A BAD GUY, BUT HE ISN'T.
at LEAST THAT'S WHAT MY KID TELLS ME. GO FIGURE.
must BE ALL THOSE BRIGHT COLORS.
Danny, I'M SORRY I COULDN'T TELL YOU I WAS A REPORTER.
Yeah. WELL, I CAN'T REALLY BE MAD AT YOU, CLARK.
I WANT TO BE.
but, UH, YOU WERE JUST DOING WHAT YOU FELT WAS RIGHT,
which IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF.
I JUST GOT ALL...
turned AROUND.
I'm GLAD YOU FOUND YOUR WAY AGAIN.
Yeah. WELL, LET'S HOLD OFF ON THAT UNTIL THE INQUEST NEXT WEEK.
but NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS...
...I KNOW THAT THEY CAN BE PROUD OF ME FROM NOW ON.
Hey, DANNY.
is IT HARD TO PUT THEM THROUGH WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY?
you JUST CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE PEOPLE YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT, YOU KNOW?
it'd BE HARDER NOT DOING IT.
I DO WHAT I DO TO...
just TO KEEP THEM SAFE.
what ABOUT YOU, CLARK?
you GOT SOMEONE WHO MAKES IT ALL WORTH IT?
if I SQUINT JUST RIGHT, IT'S LIKE WE'RE 14 AGAIN.
you SAY THAT LIKE IT'S A GOOD THING.
what's UP?
I COULDN'T SLEEP.
so YOU CAME TO A COFFEE SHOP?
not YOUR BEST PLAN, MR. KENT.
Lana, I KNOW YOU HAD REASONS FOR COMING BACK.
why ARE YOU STAYING?
leaving IS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
but, LIKE I SAID, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'LL BE HERE, SO...
whether YOU LEAVE IN 10 YEARS OR YOU LEAVE TOMORROW,
the IMPORTANT THING IS YOU'RE HERE TODAY.
...we AREN'T 14 ANYMORE.
the WORLD WILL ALWAYS BE BIGGER THAN THE BOTH OF US.
maybe IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL OR NOTHING.
for THE LAST YEAR, ALL I'VE DONE IS SACRIFICE MYSELF
and EVERYTHING THAT I LOVE FOR THE GREATER GOOD.
what IF THE REST OF THE WORLD DIDN'T HAVE TO COME FIRST?
the WORLD NEEDS YOU, CLARK.
what ABOUT WHAT WE NEED?
this engine won't start.
I don't know how to fix it.
you're home from school early.
Yeah, well, I sort of dropped out for the rest of the semester.
Clark, how could you do that?
you need me here. There's too much work.
but -- -mom, it's done.
the governor's office wants to see me.
something about your father's senate seat.
it's the last thing i want to do, but I have to go to metropolis.
while I'm there, I...
I thought I'd drop some of your father's clothes off at the homeless shelter.
maybe it's too early to get rid of them, but I...
it's so hard seeing them in the closet.
I can still smell his aftershave on the shirts.
you should take a look, see if there's something you want to keep.
no, I'm sure there's someone who can use it more than I can.
Oh.
I think your father would have wanted you to have this.
I...
I remember the day he taught you how to tell time with it.
you should wear it.
if you're going to metropolis, you should go before it gets too dark.
Hey, lady, need some help?
no, thank you. I can manage.
don't do that.
No!
nice bling, red.
that was my husband'S.
crazy bitch.
slit her throat.
I've been looking for you.
back off, freak!
or I cut her.
don't worry.
you're safe now.
Hey.
the muses weren't helping me with my astronomy paper, so I thought I'd come by and talk you into a frothy
I was on my way to the hardware store.
I've got to pick up some supplies.
are you sure it can't wait?
because I was really hoping we could talk.
Clark...
I understand.
you and your dad were really close.
Lana
you don't have to open up to me.
you just can't keep bottling this up inside.
thanks for coming by. I really have to go.
the hardware store closes in a half an hour.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
no, you're angry.
and you should be, but don't keep hiding behind it.
trust me, I've tried.
I know you're trying to help.
thank you, but you don't have to worry about me.
I'm fine.
mom?
what happened?
Oh, my god.
I was dropping off the clothes.
these two guys came out of nowhere.
are you hurt?
no, I'm all right.
Clark, somebody rescued me.
but not before they took your father's watch.
I just spent half the night at metropolis P. D.
there's not one person there who can tell me anything about who mugged my mom.
I've got that covered.
my mole down at the precinct said he'd fax me the police report as soon as he got it.
so, your mom actually saw the vigilante?
barely. She left just before the police got there.
you know there have been rumors about her flying around suicide slums for weeks, but I couldn't get a confirmed eyewitness until your mom.
now this has "front-page news
written all over it.
the vigilante is for real.
this is great, chloe.
I let my mom go down to suicide slums alone, she gets mugged, and you're cashing in on it.
Clark, I was just trying to help.
you don't have to bite my head off.
I should have just accepted the watch, like my dad would have wanted.
I couldn't even look at it.
now all I can think about is getting it back.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
they're today's obits.
Thanks.
I saw your car out front.
looks like old habits die hard.
Mrs. Kent asked me to close up for the night.
they're going through a lot right now.
look...
Lana...
Lex, it's okay.
you already said "I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, it means more when it's coming from someone who's not drunk.
you were pretty upset with clark that night.
are things better?
none of that really matters anymore.
I just want to be able to help him through this difficult time.
how's he doing?
Lex, we both know what it's like to lose a parent.
he's devastated.
Yeah, I tried to get ahold of him, but he doesn't want to see me.
well, as much as we both want to help,
I think all we can do is really just be there for him.
he's, uh...
he's very lucky to have you in his life, lana.
but when the time comes for you to lean on someone...
you know I'm always here.
all right. Now this is what I need, clark
a catchy moniker for our new crime-fighter.
miss death wish.
no, that's lame.
dirty harriet.
no, that's too derivative.
I got it. I got it, clark.
so, your mom said that she swooped down from the heavens.
so how about "the angel of vengeance"?
Chloe, police report.
right. I'm sorry, clark.
once I go woodward and bernstein, I get carried away.
I'll go check the fax.
I heard you were asking around about me.
something tells me a front-page story could be a little bad for my health.
let it go.
Comprende?
Hey, what are you doing?!
stay out of my way.
I'm one of the good guys.
Clark!
Clark, are you all right?
Yeah.
I guess round one goes to the "x" chromosomes, huh?
and how about that costume? How cool was that?
a little over the top. Police reports?
Oh, yeah, of course.
you know Choke hold and everything aside,
I've got to give the girl props for patrolling the streets.
now, I just wonder if we're dealing with natural-born-ninja territory or if she's just another garden-variety meteor freak.
whoever she is, she's got issues.
Oh, come on, clark.
you can't tell me you've never crossed any boundaries to protect your identity.
I'm gonna have to get to know her a lot more than I wanted to.
the police have no leads.
your angel of vengeance might be the only one who can I. D. The guys who mugged my mom.
well, after the way she chop-sockied you tonight,
I wouldn't hold out for an invitation to tea.
I might not have to.
No! No! Please, help!
no, no! -Give me your purse!
help! No! Help me!
all right, you know what?
we've taken this show on the road all over town, and this obviously isn't working.
you're not screaming loud enough.
Clark,
I have freaked out every alley cat within a four-block radius.
look, let's just go one more time.
one more, come on.
take it, come on.
ready? Go.
no. Help, please.
come on! -No. Please, help.
you've got to give it some feeling, some passion!
Sto-o-o-p!
you again.
I didn't come here for a fight.
well, I'm not wearing dance shoes.
well, if I had known you wanted to duel,
I would have brought my own pistol.
Oh, no. This isn't a weapon, lex.
this is a piece of history, a gift from a grateful overseas partner.
that's right.
a duel would require you to face your opponent.
you prefer to strike when they least expect it.
Oh, yeah, the activity this morning in the asian market. Is that what you mean?
I heard.
brokers were buying up shares of luthorcorp like they were half-price pot stickers.
come on, dad.
you're just using the chinese.
I know you're the one leading the apex group's hostile takeover.
and I didn't think you were paying attention.
I'm pleased to see that is not the case, huh?
wipe that smug smile off your face.
I won't let it happen.
how are you gonna stop it?
leveraged recapitalization?
your campaign directly compromised luthorcorp's assets.
there's not a single bank that will give you the money you need.
so, what are you gonna do for an encore?
put a bullet in my head?
don't be so melodramatic, lex.
I would never fire this.
it's priceless.
general macarthur wore this when he came back to the philippines.
what was it he said, son?
I have returned.
don't get ahead of yourself, dad.
you haven't taken the beach yet.
you want a show-and-tell, meathead?
why don't you go first?
I don't know.
I was born this way.
you're lucky.
the worst part is remembering what it was like to be normal.
then how did you...
turn into a freak of nature?
when I got a heart transplant, six months ago.
a girl dies in a meteor shower, and suddenly I get a souped-up second chance.
you have no idea what it's like to know that someone's life has been traded for yours.
that's why I carry this
so I'll never forget.
xxxxxxxx
xxxxx
okay, whatever.
so,
I guess you and sullivan have all the dirt you need on me now to write your little article.
I'm not here to expose you.
I need your help.
you saved my mom earlier tonight.
some guys were trying to mug her outside the east side shelter.
they took a watch.
sorry, but there are people down here who need a lot more help than finding some missing timex.
it belonged to my dad.
you lost him, didn't you?
and you can't say goodbye.
what makes you say that?
because I've never been able to.
my mom and I were coming home from my gymnastics meet.
and these two guys mugged us.
I didn't even feel the knife go into my heart.
but when I looked up...
I saw her lying there.
and they walked away...
laughing.
is that why you do this?
she dedicated her life to this group, akrada.
they fought the gangs, the dealers, even the suits who wanted to tear down our homes.
she was this...
little woman, but she was a badass.
it's not fair.
it's not fair to have someone like that just ripped out of your life.
I can help you get the watch back.
but that's not what you're really after, is it?
you want justice.
just like me.
can you tell me where they are?
they're part of the 13th street gang.
but the guy you want has gone underground.
and his gang is all packing 9 mils.
but I'm in if you're in.
Mrs. Kent, what are you doing here?
looking for clark. Have you seen him?
Yeah. About an hour ago. He left me holding the bag, literally.
Hey, you know, I heard what happened.
it's good to see that you're okay.
don't worry about clark.
I'm sure he'll pop up again soon, or blur in, or whatever it is he does.
he's been gone all night.
he's not answering his cellphone.
it's not like him.
there's a lot that's not been like him lately.
he's trying to find those guys, isn't he?
Chloe,
I know you have a lot of secrets you have to keep, but this isn't one of them.
he feels really guilty about the watch.
and me?
honestly, I think right now he's willing to feel anything except for the pain of saying goodbye.
Oh.
but that doesn't keep it from being real.
the more he refuses to go through this, -the worse it's gonna get. -I know.
I'm trying to do everything I can, but
I don't think denial is that unusual.
but clark is.
he's got to take all those emotions out somewhere.
or on someone.
and when he does, I'm afraid of what might happen.
we both know what he's capable of.
Yeah, but clark's always managed to keep things in perspective.
it's just that...
jonathan was always there.
he always knew what to say.
Mrs. Kent, I don't think that he was the only one.
when he died...
...I really didn't know if i could keep the secret by myself.
it's good to know you're here.
thank you.
he's gonna be okay.
we won't let anything happen to him.
that's the guy he's with.
sorry, this isn't a costume party.
whoa, there, jethro.
maybe you should put the brawn away and let the brains handle this.
looks like somebody got the best of you.
we're looking for that friend of yours.
you know, the one with the serpentine facial graffiti.
so, why are you talking to me?
because he's gone awol, and he's got something of mine.
we want it back.
tell us where he is.
you know what?
just tell him we're looking for him.
what are you doing?
so much for brains winning out.
snake, it's ono.
that chick showed up with some boy scout.
they said to tell you they're looking for you.
can you check the last number he dialed?
well, I guess my "go to" status has been reinstated.
for a while there, I thought maybe I'd been replaced by the leather-clad version.
do you always change in a phone booth?
the janitor was in the bathroom.
I thought the glasses were fake.
are you kidding?
I'm blind as a bat.
besides, the mask doesn't look so good with glasses over it.
Acuvue to the rescue.
those were some impressive moves you used to jack that phone.
I could use a sidekick more often.
I'm not a sidekick.
we should find a reverse phone list.
Yeah, and then maybe we can just bypass the log-on page.
got it covered.
that's why you work here, isn't it?
because nothing happens in metropolis without going through the daily planet.
way to put the pieces together, brenda starr.
unless snake's real name is beatrice krauss,
I think he's using a stolen phone.
can you pull up the outgoing calls?
it looks like he's a proud supporter of fantasy phone.
more importantly, deep-dish pizza.
Yes, I'd like to make an order for delivery.
my number is 555-1138.
1436 stanton street. Yes, that's my address.
thank you.
looks like it's time to call the police.
no. -No.
Clark, don't you think you're a little too close to this?
Chloe, if I don't use my abilities to stop lowlifes like this, what's the point in having them?
I really don't think that you should be go
don't worry.
I'll keep an eye on him.
how is it that trash like you is still alive and my dad's dead?
you better leave now, or you'll be dead, too.
you stole my dad's watch, and I want it back.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't have it anymore! I sold it!
it was my dad'S.
what are you waiting for?
he deserves to die!
if you won't kill him, I will.
no.
sorry.
I have to do this.
you.
is this the knife you used to kill my mother?
no, he's not worth it.
you didn't have to kill her.
she gave you all the money she had. Uhh!
it wasn't about the money.
I was told to make it look like a mugging.
it was a hit?
she was in their way.
Whose?
who hired you?!
the suits.
those apex suits. The ones that are tearing down the slums.
I want a name.
Andrea!
all I know is, the guy that hired me got a call from lionel luthor.
don't.
No!
I see you've already moved in.
don't you think that's a little premature, dad?
the board doesn't meet on the bid until the morning.
I value efficiency, lex. You know that.
I hear you ran a hectic phone bank today.
it must be humbling to pull all those strings and find out they're attached to nothing.
especially when your father's the one holding the scissors.
you left the company vulnerable.
then I suppose i should be thanking you.
I mean, if you hadn't tried to take it, someone else would have.
exactly. What good is having a family if they don't watch out for each other?
on the off chance that unshakable family loyalty fails, there's always those luthor closets to rummage through.
all right, let's skip the prologue, lex.
what ancient skeleton do you think you've dug up this time?
well, it's not quite a skeleton yet.
more like a freshly laid corpse.
I wonder how martha kent would feel if she knew you had a secret meeting with her husband right before he died.
now, a transgression like that would test the virtues of even the most forgiving woman.
what do you want, lex?
I hope you enjoyed your stay.
sorry it was so short.
snake?
snake!
you're a dead man.
you kicked people out of their homes so you could develop suicide slums for profit.
my mother stood up to you, so you had her murdered.
no one escapes justice, luthor...
not even you.
listen, we're not as different as you might think.
like you know anything about me.
I do. I grew up on the same treacherous streets as you did.
I lost my parents just like you did, to a senseless crime.
it wasn't senseless. It was calculated.
Andrea, stop!
let the police do their job. If he's guilty, he'll pay.
if your father was murdered, and you were face-to-face with his killer, what would you do?
what if you're wrong?
what if he had nothing to do with it?
Andrea, listen to him. Listen.
look, I know what's in your heart.
it's anger.
I feel it, too.
but killing him, taking his life, is not gonna change anything.
Yes, it will!
Andrea, stop.
think about your mother.
is this what she would want you to do?
let him go.
let him go, and everything will be okay.
I killed a man.
and I know you, clark.
you could never let me walk out of here.
it's time for you to be the real hero.
exceptional woman.
grossly misguided.
she's been through a lot.
why do I think you saved my life for her sake, not for mine?
whatever the reason...
thank you, son.
Martha, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
it's all right.
I was somewhere else.
Yes.
these days must be difficult to get through. I understand.
when my wife
when lillian died, I...
I thought i'd never be whole again.
it takes a long time to let yourself heal.
well, I'm doing the best I can.
I hear the governor has asked you to take jonathan's seat in the senate.
I haven't even told clark about that.
how do you know?
I make it a point to know things.
I...I wanted to find out how you were.
I'm not sure I'm going to accept the offer, if you came by to sway me one way or the other.
no, you're quite capable of making that decision on your own.
I'm only sorry that they burdened you with this.
you've got so much to deal with now, martha.
I know that jonathan leveraged a good part of the farm.
that was his decision.
that was his pride.
so he could pay back the campaign contribution I made.
I can't accept it.
jonathan and i let politics and money come between us.
I don't want that to happen to us, martha.
if you need anything...
please, I'm here for you always.
as a friend.
Hey.
I found her desk like this when I got in this morning.
I called her home, her cell.
it looks like she pulled an amelia earhart.
she's never gonna let anyone find her now.
Yeah, well, I guess exile is the price you have to pay when you play judge, jury, and executioner.
Yeah.
Clark, what really happened out there?
I should have listened to you, chloe.
you tried to warn me.
I had my hand around that guy's throat.
and I thought that if I just kept squeezing the life out of him, it would make everything right again.
God, clark.
but you didn'T.
no.
what made you stop?
my dad's voice.
this is gonna sound weird, but I...
I could hear him.
he was the one who always kept me from going over the edge when I was too close.
it's too bad andrea didn't step back in time.
I think metropolis could really use someone like her right now.
do you think you could ever do what she did?
play the mild-mannered reporter by day and a crime-fighter by night?
honestly?
I'm kind of hoping i can find a way to not have to hide who I really am.
I searched every pawnshop in metropolis for it.
I can't believe you found this.
Lana...
I'm sorry for the way i've been acting.
I know I should be able to move on, but life without him...
...doesn't feel real.
it's like you're frozen, and the whole world is going on around you.
no matter how many people want to be there for you, you end up going through this alone.
it's not like you ever let me take the easy way out, either, huh?
put it on.
it looks great.
your dad would be really happy.
here, go that way. Make a figure eight.
xxxxxxx
don't worry, sweetheart!
it's gonna be fine!
always say
that way?
xxxxxxx
what, are you kidding?
this young man is a man of steel!
look at him.
make one more turn.
xxxxxx
Clark, I know hunting down zoners is your top priority, but if you haven't found anything in south america, we still have a situation back here in kansas we need to deal with.
no, he'll be here in 15 minutes.
okay. Great.
I'll see you in a few.
Dr. Casselli.
you're early.
you are annoyingly persistent, miss sullivan.
I've already told you I don't know anything.
don't sell yourself short, doctor.
I think you're a very knowledgeable man.
in the last few months, over a dozen patients have been transferred out of the high-security wing at belle reve.
I believe that's your signature on all the paperwork.
patients are transferred in and out of mental facilities all the time.
even ones that exhibit unusual abilities?
where are they transferred to?
is luthorcorp involved?
does this have anything to do with 33. 1?
okay. I'll take that as a "no comment.
I didn't want any of this.
but it was so much money.
Chloe? You okay?
Yeah.
just in the nick of time, as always.
it wasn't me. He was already down when I got here.
what?
well, if it wasn't you, then who
he's open! Pass the ball!
pass the
Oh! What's the matter with you, man?
still too slow, stretch.
Bart.
he got away from you?
I thought you were the fastest man alive.
he saved your life, which is more than I can say.
Oh, come on, clark. It wasn't your fault.
even with all your powers, you can't be everywhere at once.
I have to be.
I'm the only one who can round up the prisoners from the phantom zone and stop lex from experimenting on people with abilities.
what did you find out from casselli about 33. 1?
nothing, and I'm not going to.
casselli was in and out of prison before the ink could dry on his fingerprints.
how'd he get out so fast?
I don't know, but a luthorcorp lawyer paid casselli a visit right before his release.
Lex.
casselli could be stashed halfway around the world by now.
I'll get in touch with lionel. Maybe he can tell us something.
I'll keep sifting through my luthorcorp intel.
maybe we'll get lucky, and I'll come up with a few bread crumbs.
Hey, gorgeous. What's up? You miss me?
I'm bart allen. We had a moment on the town last time I was here.
two years ago, before you had a boyfriend.
Oh! Right! Wow.
it's good to see you again, bart.
I'll see you around.
muy caliente.
knock it off.
what's with the spanish?
I just grabbed lunch down in mexico, man.
they got this burrito down there - el intestine-o buster.
you got to take a run down there with me to try one.
what are you doing here, bart?
I'm hanging out with my amigo, man. What's it look like?
that's what I'm trying to find out.
last time you blew through town, you stole my dad's wallet then swiped a priceless artifact from lex. You nearly got yourself killed.
Yeah. Yeah, those were the days, huh?
Yeah, all right. Look, man,
I already told you, things are different now, okay?
I mean, back then, I needed a super-kick in the butt, and you laid it on me, and ever since then, there's been no more stealing for this gringo, I swear.
am I really supposed to just buy that?
I could squirt out some tears if that'll help.
no, but the truth might.
what were you doing at the daily planet?
I saw chloe-licious had a byline a while back.
and I was in town on business, figured I ought to check it out.
what kind of business?
I'm a courier. I pick things up. I drop them off.
Lickety-split. Don't have a fit.
all right. Look, man, whatever. You don't trust me. That's fine.
okay, I'll be gonebefore you can even blink.
I don't know.
I can still blinkpretty fast.
mexico, huh? Want to go get that burrito?
Excelente.
now, that is what I call a three-martini lunch.
it wasa four-martini lunch if you include the onethat you spilled on my shirt.
right.
well, how am I ever going tomake it up to you?
I don't know. Because, uh...
it's my favorite shirt.
well, then, I think we shouldget it into the laundry so that it doesn't stain.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
I got to take this.
go ahead.
give me five minutes.
I, uh...
you know, what I had in mind is gonna take a little longerthan five minutes.
rain check?
sure.
I'll just put it nextto the rest of the umbrellas you keep handing me.
Lois
I mean, is it just me or is this relationshipall interruptus and no coitus?
you're always running off just when thingsstart getting interesting, and I like being interested -a lot.
Yeah. I know. You're right.
it's, uh... it's not fair to you.
I think we should takea break.
you mean like, what...
see other people?
uh, well, okay. Yeah, I mean, if that's what you want.
I was actually thinkingmore along the lines of taking a vacation...
together.
Really?
Yeah, really.
no rushing outin the middle of the good stuff?
no. None.
it'll be you, me, and...
Monte carlo?
there's just a few thingsthat I do need to take care of before we go, and I think once we get
God, you're good at that.
I'll start packing. - Okay.
Bye.
game ON
I need to talk to you. You alone?
just meand my shadow, dad.
Lana's in paris with nell, shopping for a wedding dress.
that's goodshe's out of the country consideringwhat's happening.
look, if this is aboutdr. Casselli
casselli? He's the least of our worries.
another luthorcorp facilityhas been hit. That's six.
each one of them hassome connection with 33. 1.
the only thinghoused in those facilities was peripheral research.
all the vital data isstill secure in the mainframe.
how long do you think beforethat location is compromised?
if it ever became publicthat luthorcorp is experimenting on peoplewith abilities
it won'T.
what's this?
a single framepulled off a security camera from one of the break-ins.
whoever is responsible has the ability to move fasterthan a speeding bullet.
such a unique individual would make an interestingtest subject to add to 33. 1, don't you think?
what do you plan to do?
protect our investment.
come on. I'll walk you out.
Yeah, I got it.
meet me at the rendezvous.
Hey, are we gonna do this or are you gonna lurkin the shadows all night?
just being careful.
after all, I'm not as fast as you.
Clark.
I was, uh, just thinking about you.
you got a funny wayof showing it.
I've left youhalf a dozen messages.
I'm sorry. I've been preoccupied.
helping that doctorfrom belle reve get out of jail.
Clark, my involvementwith belle reve is past history.
but it appearsthat you still have a very active interestin breaking into luthorcorp.
where was this taken?
mexico - the luthorcorpprocessing plant.
if you're going to continueplaying games like this, you should be more careful.
this isn't me.
no?
who is it, then?
God, mrs. K, thank you so much. This was so good.
where do you put it all?
you eat more than clark, and he's twice your size.
Yeah, well, you know, I burn a lot of calories.
well, there's plenty morein the fridge.
I have to runto a meeting.
would you mindcleaning up?
Yeah, anything for you, mrs. K.
it's niceto have you here, bart. I hope you stay longerthis time.
Hey, what's up, man? You just missed a killer spread.
you can cut the act.
I know about luthorcorp and the break-ins by somebodywho's as fast as me.
Yeah. Faster, actually.
you know what's funny? I actually believed your storyabout how I changed your life.
look, it's not a story, clark, okay?
really, I'm not the same guy.
you stole from lex before. You're stealing from him again.
what's the difference?
it's just - ugh! -It's complicated.
I'm a smart guy. Explain it to me.
I can'T.
why not? I thought we were amigos.
we are.
then tell me why you're stealingfrom luthorcorp.
I JUST I CAN't
I'll find outfor myself, then.
look, I'm sorry I can't tell youall my secrets, clark.
okay? I thought a guy like youwould understand.
I know it's justa vacation, but
what? Vacation? No, vacation is palm springs.
Monte carlois a fairy tale.
Yeah, hopefullywithout prince charming having a disappearing actevery five minutes.
um, I think you'll be keepinghis full attention, lois.
Yeah, you know, I'd better. It's not like I govictoria's secret for anybody.
what do you think? Should I have gone with the blk lace?
no.
something tells me greenis definitely his color.
Hey, chloe.
God. Smallville. Learn how to knock.
what if I'd been naked?
Lois is jetting offto monte carlo with oliver.
Oliver?
I'll send you a postcardif I'm not too busy.
no, lois, you should, um...
get a couple new bikinis.
good idea. Thanks, smallville.
maybe it wasn'tsuch a good idea to help oliverkeep his secret from her.
what, that he's the green arrow?
no offense, but you weren'texactly honest with lana about your secret, either.
look how that ended up.
maybe all keeping secretsdoes sometimes is force you to lieto the people you care about.
are we stilltalking about oliver?
the guy who saved youat the planet
he didn't exactly get away. It's bart.
what? Wait a minute. Bart can superspeed, too?
he's actually a lot fasterthan I am. That's the truth.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
it's fine. You were protecting him. It's okay.
I mean, if anyone gets it, it's me.
but why are yououting him now?
I think he's headed for trouble, and I need to find him.
can you gps his cellphone?
Yeah, I can try. Do you have his number?
he broke into a luthorcorp plantdown in mexico.
now I think lexis on to him.
if he tries to break intoanother facility...
no good. His phone must be off.
what about call history? Can you pull up a record?
legally? Absolutely not.
there's over a dozen callsto that number in the last 24 hours.
let's see who's onthe other end.
Artemis global consortium? Never heard of them.
it's as subsidiaryof J. L. International, which is a satellitecompany currently orbiting...
queen industries?
it's oliver.
he's using bartto attack luthorcorp.
I'm in.
not so fast now, are you?
Oliver.
look, clark, whatever's gotyour tighty whities in a bunch, now is not the time.
Where's bart? I saw his phone records.
I know he's working for you.
not for me. Working with me.
there's a difference.
it's not gonna matter whenhe ends up in jail or worse.
Yeah, you don't knowwhat you're talking about.
I know how muchyou hate lex.
is that whyyou recruited bart
to help withyour little vendetta?
no. To stop 33. 1.
you know about 33. 1?
why didn't you tell mewhat you were up to?
Clark, do you check in with me every time you run offto save the world?
Oh, that's right. For a second there, I forgot.
you like to wait for troubleto show up on your doorstep.
that's not true.
then why haven't you doneanything to stop 33. 1?
I was busywith another problem.
what could be more urgentthan lex luthor developing an armyof superfreaks, clark?
that's what he's doing.
he's starting a war.
what have you found out?
not enough.
last nightbart infiltrated a place that was supposed to housethe mainframe for 33. 1.
that's the last timeI heard from him.
so I reconnedthe target this morning.
the placehad been stripped clean. Everything's gone.
the whole thingwas a setup.
Lex has bart.
we have to find him.
my team's already on it. - Your team?
not everybodyflies solo, kent.
morning, sunshine.
I know you.
you've stolen from mebefore.
I want a lawyer.
and I want a ponytail.
disappointment abounds.
who do you work for?
what you see is what you get, there, goldilocks.
you're a low-level thief.
swiping corporate dataisn't your style.
now, tell mewho you're working for, and this won't have to getunpleasant.
all right.
all right.
I work for a guycalled mr. Kiss-my-butt.
would you like meto introduce you?
the floor of your cellhas been outfitted with pressure platesdesigned to track movement.
stop in one placefor even a millisecond after I activate them, and you fry.
last chance.
well, maybe you'll feelmore talkative when you get tiredof running.
Aah!
A. C.Checkthe luthorcorp manifests.
gotcha.
how long have you guysbeen working together?
I joined upabout six months ago.
Ollie and bart had alreadybeen doing their thing.
what about your girlfriend -katherine?
dude, don't even go there.
she gave it her best shot.
but with all this hardwarein me...
I'm sorry, victor.
Ollie found me. I was living on the streets.
he gave me a warm meal, roof over my head...
and a reason to go on living.
did he just saysomething nice about me?
maybe he's startingto rust.
A. C.How'd you fallinto all this?
I got into a little troublesinking a whaler off the coast of japan.
a little trouble? That'swhat you're gonna go with?
Ollie had to save your scalybutt from getting filleted.
I would have gottenout of it.
before or after they packed youinto a thousand little tin cans?
well, at least he wouldhave been dolphin-safe.
fish jokes.
that's all I ever getare fish jokes.
so how's lois doing, man? Is she all right?
I think you'd have to askyour boss.
now is not the time. We need to focuson locating bart.
and how exactly did you get himinvolved in this?
he's never beenmuch of a team player.
looks like you two havesomething in common, huh?
actually, I was out on patrolin star city one night, and I came across bart. He was helping himselfto a free meal.
I could tell he was a good kid, you know?
he just neededa little direction, so I offered him a job.
look where that got him.
I underestimated lex.
it won't happen again.
I've compiled a listof all luthorcorp holdings within a 100-mile radius.
Bart could be heldin any one of those facilities.
that's a lot of real estateto cover.
I think I know someonewho can help us narrow it down.
Victor stone and arthur curryare working for him, too?
Yeah, oliver's been busy.
is there anythingin your luthorcorp intel that can help us find outwhere bart's being held?
I don't know.
uh... wait.
when I had my feelers outfor dr. Casselli, I managed to shake loosesome internal documents.
in the last few days, there's been a flurryof equipment transfers to the ridge facilitieson the outskirts of metropolis.
doesn't luthorcorpmove equipment all the time?
this isn't just a coupleof forklifts, clark.
half a ton of lead shielding, electrical pressure plates, more than $20 millionworth of equipment to measure high-velocityparticles.
Bart. Take everythingand bring it to oliver.
me? Clark
I can get to the ridgefaster myself.
I can't let anythinghappen to bart.
Mr. Queen, it's chloe sullivan. Clark sent me.
Where's clark?
he went to rescue bart.
he told you about bart?
we trust each other. Clark tells me everything
well, almost everything.
I did have to figure out about your green-leather fetishon my lonesome.
don't worry. I didn't say anything to lois.
although, you mightwant to consider
Hey, let's just stick tothe main plot, there, sidekick.
so, what do you got?
hopefully a solid leadon bart.
where are victor and A. C?
guess we're not that good at the whole "secret" partof this yet.
Yeah, but you're great atgetting caught by the villain.
anyway, I think bart'sbeing held at a placecalled the ridge facility.
that's down by the docks.
it's on our listof possible 33. 1 targets.
all right, boys. You know the drill. Let's gear up and get out.
Oh, no.
what now?
lead shielding. This isn't just for bart.
I think the ridge facility'sbeing used to refine meteor rock.
Clark's in trouble.
restricted
green arrow to watchtower. We're in position.
okay, there should be a securityaccess panel near the east door.
according to this schematic, you need to very carefullyrewire the sys
or...
I could just jack in andshut the whole perimeter down.
you can do that?
queen industries upgrade.
Accessingperimeter security.
perimeter neutralized.
Aquaman, you're up.
perimeter breached. Proceeding to target.
you'd make one hellof a can opener.
you'd look good on a bag of green beans.
all right, we're in. Which way?
the refinement vault's100 meters southwest.
still no word from clark.
if he's in there, we'll get him out. Let's go.
you've gota different mission.
you're the boss, robin hood.
what mission? What are you doing?
watchtower to green arrow. What's your status?
Switchingto silent running.
stand byfor instructions.
Aquaman, do your thing.
Hey. You're not supposed to be here.
neither am I.
come on.
I'm all right. - You sure?
green arrow to watchtower. Boy scout'sout of the woods.
boy scout?
if you hadn't ran off, you couldhave picked your code name.
you don't want to playfor the team, that's fine.
point taken. Where's bart?
impulse. " He didn't get to pickhis own code name either.
watchtower will guide you towhere he's probably being held.
what are yougonna be doing?
what I do best.
watchtower to boy scout. Let's find impulse.
cyborg to aquaman. Where the hell are you, fish stick?
dude, what took you so long?
nice.
but, please, put a shirt on.
I swim fasterwhen I'm naked.
I bet you do.
you're lucky I still gotmy pants on.
impulse located.
Bart, you okay?
muy bueno, amigo.
I don't care. I want a level-one lockdown.
no one gets in or out.
little late for that.
you got 10 minutesto clear your people out of here before I blow this placeoff the map.
you.
you remember. I'm touched.
well, it's a little hardto forget.
last time we met, you put an arrow in my chest.
you put a bullet in mine. Bygones?
go to hell.
you first.
can you superspeed?
Yeah, I just - I need a minuteto catch my breath.
you know what? You're gonnahave to catch it later.
Aquaman, cyborg, rendezvous alpha confirmed.
we're on the move.
watchtower, have all luthor'speople cleared the building?
the last heat signaturesare moving away from the north.
wait a second. What are you doing?
what do you thinkI'm doing?
you want more of your friendsto end up in here?
Yeah, I'm voting noon that one.
watchtower, are you sureeveryone's out of the building?
100% positive.
all right. Let's do it.
have the jet fueledand ready. I want to be in the airas soon as possible.
Hey.
I hope your bird's gotsome serious lift, 'cause this thingweighs a ton.
aren't you packed yet?
Where's your stuff?
Lois, um...
don't even think about sayingwhat I think you're gonna say.
I'm sorry. I, um, I have to go awayon business.
postpone it.
it's not that simple.
nothing with you ever is.
you're like two completelydifferent people.
there's the charming, romantic guy that I fell in love with, and then there'sthis other guy who can't stick aroundin one place long enoughto see what he's missing.
ever sincemy parents died...
...I've jumped aroundfrom city to city, from continentto continent.
and... in all those years...
...not once have I regrettedleaving anyone.
but then I met you.
then stay.
I can'T.
because there are more importantthings in this world than what I want...
and what I love.
I hope somedayI can explain why.
don't expect meto be waiting around for that when you get back.
I'm not coming back, lois.
at least not anytime soon.
I'm sorry.
I never wanted to hurt you.
well, you finally got aroundto it anyway, didn't you?
this is the... the moment, right?
the moment that I'm gonna regretfor the rest of my life, isn't it?
Yes.
I loved you.
Bart allen - gone. He escaped.
a multimillion-dollarinstallation destroyed.
33. 1 irrevocablycompromised.
but, son, at least you found out the jolly green archerand his extraordinary cohorts
they're not yourrun-of-the-mill adversaries.
which is exactly whywe have to continue with 33. 1.
if terroristslike green arrow are recruiting peoplewith abilities, the only way to protect freedomand democracy is to fight firewith fire.
freedom and democracy?
well, I hadn't realizedyour goals were quite so lofty.
well, there's a lotthat escapes your attention in your declining years, dad, but not mine.
the security footage from the ridge facilitywas destroyed.
however, several guards describeone of green arrow's men as someone that soundedremarkably like clark kent.
Clark. Impossible.
a word that always seems to popup when talking about him, doesn't it?
Lex, it was not clark.
how can you be so sure?
because I was having dinnerwith him last night when all this happened.
Martha made pot roast with new potatoesand tiny little baby carrots.
it was delicious. Clark had three helpings.
don't worry, son.
you still haveplenty of enemies out there plotting your downfall.
okay. Thanks.
so the daily planetis running with the story that a gas explosion destroyedthe vacant luthorcorp building down by the docks.
vacant?
looks like the luthor cover-upmachine is in full swing.
well, at leastwe got bart out before lex ran himinto an early grave.
come on. No worries. I had plenty of juice left.
could have fooled me, the way you cleaned outmama kent's fridge.
that's 'cause I like to stayfueled up.
just in case I need to, uh, spring into action.
I still have a boyfriend.
Yeah. Well, a man can dream, can't he?
now you knowwhy we call him impulse.
impulse, cyborg, aquaman, green arrow. What do you guys callyour team?
I don't know. I've been thinkingthat we need something cool.
we need something like -like
I was thinking about somethingwith the word "justice" in it.
after all, that's what lexis gonna get a big dose of.
Victor and A. C. Were able tohack into the 33. 1 mainframe before we blewthe building.
that wasyour other mission.
haven't met the computer yetI couldn't crack wide open.
what did you guysfind out?
that lex isn't satisfied playingin his own backyard anymore.
Luthorcorp is starting updivisions of 33. 1 all across the globe.
wherever there's evidenceof people with abilities, there'll be laboratoriesto do experiments on them.
we can't let that happen.
we won'T.
gentlemen, our first target is a large facilityon the island of corto maltese.
you guys know the drill. Wheels up in 30 minutes. Get your gear.
you coming, amigo?
Yeah, you got to comewith us, man.
we could usethe big guns.
they're right, you know - you'dbe a major asset to the team.
I want to be a part of this, guys. I really do.
but...
that problem I told you about -the one that I caused
I have to take careof that first.
this isn't the endof the story, clark.
this is just the beginning.
Chloe.
come on, boys.
let's go save the world.
activity
take your squad. Sweep the perimeter. Go.
what's our status?
security breach --northeast sector.
what have the surveillance cameras picked up?
not a damn thing.
anything comes down this tunnel, kill it. - got it.
contact? - Tunnel 7.
wait.
section "f" compromised.
lock it down.
section "D."compromised
that's only 30 meters from here.
section "C"compromised 20 meters.
10
section "B."compromised - Maybe this wasn'tsuch a good idea. - Section "A."compromised
mission accomplished.
standing by for further instructions.
vitals are steady.
he didn't even break a sweat.
2 minutes, 18 seconds to infiltrate a secured facility, disable my best men, and eliminate the target.
not a bad test run.
get some fresh guards.
I want to see him do it again.
we have about a dozen people that could do that for you.
next thing you know, they'll be brushing my teeth for me.
there are some things I'd rather do on my own.
independent and not afraid to get her hands dirty
two of the billion or so reasons I fell in love with you.
the shoulder's just still a little bit sore.
maybe we should have the doctor look at it again.
no, it's okay.
Lana, you were shot.
takes more than a bullet to stop a luthor.
sir, senator burke has arrived.
show him in.
you've been seeing a lot of the senator recently.
the price of doing business with the government.
but this will just take a minute.
I'll be in the garden.
Mrs. Luthor. - Senator
I hope I didn't interrupt a tender moment.
if you had, you'd still be waiting outside.
I'm not gonna keep you from your pretty lady.
I just, uh...swung by for an update on ares.
the prototype is in the final stages of testing.
everything's on schedule.
Really?
I heard everything was ahead of schedule
way ahead.
I stuck my neck out to get the armed services committee to allow you access to military resources and personnel to "r" and "d" a single prototype, but you've started gearing up for mass production.
just looking towards the future, senator.
I assumed a visionary like you would understand that.
how long do you think you're gonna be able to keep what you've really got going on here a secret?
see...
one of my own men believed he uncovered a mole right in your backyard.
who?
well, I wish I could tell you, but my boy doesn't talk too good with a bullet through his heart.
senator, if there are leaks in my security,
I assure you, I will have them taken care of.
well, doesn't that just fill me with the warm fuzzies?
do you know what'll happen to me if the senate ever got wind of what you're up to now?
I assume they wouldn't care for it...
just like they wouldn't care for all the money
I've transferred into your cayman account over the last year.
project ares is over.
I'm shutting it down.
that would be ill-advised.
no.
what's ill-advised is you ever opening your mouth about our arrangement.
I so much as hear a peep out of you,
I'll make sure the committee reviews every business deal luthorcorp has made in the last 20 years, and u'll be lucky to keep that fancy shirt on your back.
do we understand each other...
Luthor?
perfectly.
Luthorcorp - - Yes
greetings from patagonia, the most beautiful place on earth.
what is that?
we have to talk.
Clark, you should, uh, try picking up the phone occasionally
might be quicker.
Oh, but maybe not.
what do you know about lana?
letting go
never been one of your strong points, was it?
telling the truth was never one of yours.
and you're accusing me of what, exactly, this time?
Lana came to me the day of the wedding to tell me she wasn't going through with it, that she was leaving lex.
apparently, she changed her mind.
or someone changed it for her.
so, you think I had something to do with her decision?
if lana was so unhappy with lex, why go through with the marriage?
it's surprising, clark, what people will do when they, uh, feel they have no other options.
if I find out that you had anything to do with lana marrying lex, the gloves will come off.
how do you like that option?
triple espresso mocha cappu latte -- my own invention, guaranteed to put the zip-a-dee back in your doo-dah.
Thanks.
come on. It's not that bad.
Jimmy is coming back one day...
maybe.
you know, besides, distance is good for the relationship.
that is what all the guys who've moved away from me have said.
Lois, you should really stick to investigative reporting and out of the advice column.
that's the plan.
Hey, smallville.
love to hear about the cows and the corn, but I got a lead on a dirty senator that needs to be hosed down.
see you on the front page.
she going after a senator?
I guess so. She hasn't told me much about it.
lot of that going around lately.
was that jab directed at my chin?
I went to lionel to ask about lana.
what did he say?
nothing, just like you.
did you forget what he did to you, what he did to your mother?
no, I haven't forgotten.
I don't want anything to happen to lana.
neither do I.
but if she's staying in that marriage, all I can say is, she must have a damn good reason.
are you sure about this?
got the reservation.
eats here every time he's in town.
voil?
thanks for the tip.
senator burke.
how do you do?
Lois lane, reporter.
I was hoping to ask a few questions.
sure. Schedule an interview with my office.
you know, I tried to, but no one returned my calls.
well, that ought to tell you something, sweet cakes.
senator, last year, your salary was $150, 000.
can you tell me how you managed to deposit over $5 million in a cayman account?
what paper did you say you work for, uh, miss...
lane -- lois lane.
I'm a reporter for the inquisitor.
the inquisitor?
that's not a newspaper. That's a
that's a cat-box liner.
now get her out of here.
Hey, get your hands off me, you fascist!
I'm warning you! If you don't
Oh, my god.
Wes?
Chloe, what's going on?
you haven't heard? Senator burke was murdered.
what?
it looks like burke was in bed with la famiglia.
he crossed them. They gave him the fredo treatment.
it's a mob hit.
well, all evidence points to that, but there is one witness who doesn't think so.
Lois? - Thanks.
what happened to you?
well, one minute, I was harassing a public official, and the next, he came out of nowhere, like a ghost.
Burke and his men never had a chance.
y-you saw who did this?
Yeah, I did more than see him, clark -- I know him.
his name's wes keenan.
we were army brats together when we were kids.
I'm running a check on his name.
looks like he works for the mob now.
Wes? No way.
he's career military.
he's been decorated more than a christmas tree.
even my dad loved him, and the general hates everybody.
Lois, are you sure the man you saw is wes keenan?
I haven't seen him for years, but he has this little scar above his right eye, and
trust me. It was wes.
not according to the U. S. Government.
he was in a helicopter crash in afghanistan four months ago.
he was killed in action.
no, that is not possible.
I know what I saw.
what else does it say? - Nothing.
I mean, his military records have been classified.
what is that?
his alpha wave just spiked for a second.
it's probably just feedback from the implants in his cortex.
probably?
it's nothing to worry about.
everything's still holding within operational parameters.
make sure it stays that way.
sir.
just received information that burke's been eliminated.
evidence trail?
leads straight back to the mob, per your instructions.
there's been a complication.
there was a witness.
nothing can get in the way of completing this project
nothing.
take care of it.
you heard the man.
prep him.
Lois, quit being stubborn.
you're gonna stay here until we get this cleared up.
Thanks, but I can take care of myself.
nobody's doubting that, but you'd be safer here at the farm.
it'll be like old times, like when you first got to smallville.
Oh, you're just hoping to catch me in the shower again.
I-I mean, um, thank you.
I-I really appreciate it.
you're always welcome here, lois.
you're practically family.
well, since I'm being a burden, can I just ask one more favor?
what do you need?
your mom's political influence.
look, do you think that you could use your connections to get a look at wes' military jacket?
I thought you said that file was classified.
it is.
I contacted the general, but, uh, he went all cold war on me and said that I should drop it.
he might have a point.
three men are already dead.
which is why I have to get my hands on that file.
it might explain why wes is doing this.
well, I've made a few friends in washington.
I don't know if they can help, but I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, mrs. Kent.
I know that look, and it's usually followed by you almost getting yourself killed.
this isn't just another story, clark
not this time.
Wes and I
we were close.
I know it was him.
stay here.
see? It was just the wind.
Clark, watch out!
Wes?
how could lois have been kidnapped with you standing right there?
she just vanished, chloe, literally.
so, he could teleport, like alicia?
but something's different.
it's more like what graham garrett could do.
so, he can turn himself invisible?
not just himself -- he took lois with him.
and it's not his only ability.
when he hit me
Chloe, I haven't felt anything like that since I went up against titan.
Clark, we need to find lois before wes
we will.
were you able to uncover anything about wes that might be able to help us figure out where he took her?
I haven't been able to retrieve any information from the military files, but I did run a cross-check on his name, and I found one hit
Jodi keenan.
Jodi keenan?
isn't that the woman who tried to kill lex in the tunnels?
guess who she's married to. - Wes?
looks like jodi found out that wes wasn't killed in afghanistan.
she followed the trail all the way back here to lex.
okay, so, wes is exhibiting multiple krypto-abilities.
and according to lois, he's also on the receiving end of some sort of mind control.
how much do you want to bet that all of this plays into lex's 33. 1 experiments?
Chloe, I need you to contact oliver and his team.
they've been taking out 33. 1 facilities all around the world.
don't you think that's a hero-to-hero phone call?
I'm gonna talk to lex.
Clark, come on.
we both know that lex isn't gonna tell you anything.
then I'll find somebody who will.
too much?
no, it'S...
I thought maybe if I set the mood...
or maybe not.
Lex...
sorry to bother you, sir.
the asset failed to return.
I'll be right back.
Lana.
you shouldn't be here. Lex is just outside.
I had to see you.
Clark...
it's not about you and me.
Lois is in trouble.
and what makes you think I can help?
cause it seems there's a connection to lex.
Lana, if you've seen or heard anything
maybe something about the military...
Ares.
that's the god of war.
Lex has been talking to senator burke about this military project called "ares.
yesterday, he threatened to shut it down.
maybe you should talk with him.
I can'T.
senator burke is dead.
he was murdered by the same man who has lois.
Lana, is there anything else
maybe something that lex let slip?
one of his men was just saying something about an asset that failed to return.
an asset?
that's what the military calls its soldiers.
Lex is connected to this.
Lana, whatever reason you had to go through with the wedding, it was the wrong choice.
you have no idea what he's capable of.
you'd be surprised what I know.
then why are you still here?
we all have our secrets, clark.
sometimes, we have to keep them to protect the people that we care about.
Lana...
I know.
Lana?
you okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm just a little chilly.
look, something's come up.
I need to go in to the office.
don't wait up.
Wes.
designation incorrect.
call sign "ares,"prototype mark iv.
you don't remember me, do you?
it's lois -- lois lane.
my father is general sam lane.
when I was a kid, he used to drag me around to all the bases that he was stationed at.
one of them was fort addleson, where I met you.
do you remember how you got that scar?
you used to tell everybody that you got it falling off your dirt bike.
but that's not how it happened.
we got into the general's whiskey.
then we broke into the storage warehouse.
we were wrestling around, being stupid.
and I kissed you...
...the first timeI ever kissed anybody.
and you smiled your crooked smile.
and then you puked and passed out and cracked your head open on the floor.
never could handle your liquor, wes.
mission incomplete. - No.
eliminate target.
why did you bring me here?
think. Wes.
this is fort addleson, okay?
this is the warehouse.
this is where I kissed you that night.
remember me!
Mr. Luthor.
three years and a billion dollars spent on ares, and you're telling me you lost him?
well, we're in unchartered territory here, mr. Luthor.
synthesizing multiple meteor abilities is difficult enough, but stringing together the molecular chain with peptides extracted from that creature that bartlett recovered
the only thing that allows all these abilities to exist in one subject.
titan's genetic material was the key to making this project viable.
Yes, which makes the results as unpredictable as the substances I'm being asked to work with.
what you're being asked to do is help protect the world, doctor.
unstable criminals with dangerous powers are becoming more and more common.
humanity's only chance of surviving the onslaught is this project.
so, kick that big brain of yours into high gear and figure out what the hell went wrong!
it's possible something might have triggered a decay in his memory blocks
a familiar place or person.
can't you get a fix on him?
the field he generates makes it impossible to track him electronically.
it's part of his design.
I want our dog back on his leash, doctor, or you'll be my next experiment.
maybe I could reposition the luthorcorp satellites...
...generate a broad-spectrum pulse that will, hopefully, re-initiate his command directives, but there's no guarantee.
I'm not asking for guarantees.
I'm asking for results.
I want ares back online and his mission complete.
start the pulse.
I killed a united states senator?
what happened?
how did you end up like this?
I was stationed in afghanistan.
our convoy hit an I. E.D.
and then I woke up in the military hospital.
that's when luthor showed up.
Lex.
I should have known.
he forced you into this, didn't he?
he offered me a way to keep serving my country.
by turning you into a brain-dead assassin?
you think this is what I signed on for?
he told me project ares was gonna help soldiers protect themselves on the field, so they wouldn't end up like I did.
we won't let him get away with this, I promise you.
okay, we will expose lex and project ares.
what? What? What is it? What?
them
they're trying to get back into my head.
well, fight it, wes. Look at me. Look at me!
run. Run! Run!
I think lex was experimenting on wes, trying to make him into a supersoldier.
with pick-and-choose meteor powers
Oliver told me pretty much the same thing.
Oliver knew about wes?
no. He found an earlier model in the utah desert.
it looks like this isn't the first time one of lex's souped-up rambos has gone awol.
was he able to stop him? - Barely.
it took the equivalent of a mini-nuk to break through his force field.
Clark, even if you find him, I'm not sure
maybe this will help
Wes' military jacket.
how did you get that?
called in a few favors and had to promise a couple dozen of my own.
Lois is right. Wes was a hero.
he took her instead of killing her.
you know If whatever programming they're using to control wes is failing, maybe he'll go back to a place he remembers.
somewhere he lived or --or was stationed.
the military base that wes grew up on was decommissioned a few years ago
fort addleson, just outside of metropolis.
Sam lane was stationed there when lois was in junior high.
maybe that's where
do you ever get used to that? - Not really.
Wes?
you have to fight this.
don't let them do this to you again.
you are not a murderer.
please.
Wes.
Wes.
System...damaged.
turn protocol 38529532...
Wes.
Lois.
you're gonna be fine.
do you understand me? You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna go get help, all right?
no.
better this way.
they'll never...
stop trying...
to control me.
you have to stay with me. Do you hear me?
don't...
let them do this...
to anyone else.
okay? - Okay.
I promise, but you just stay with me, okay?
don't leave me.
Wes?
Wes?
no, no, no. No.
Wes?
Wes!
come on!
don't leave me!
Kent farm
how does this happen?
all wes wanted to do was serve his country, and he wound up being used as a pawn.
it happens more than I'd like to think.
well, now that senator burke is gone
Oh, burke isn't the only one on the hill lining his pockets.
wherever there's power, there will be men like lex to exploit it.
maybe you can do something, maybe open an investigation.
Clark, I'm a little fish in a tiny pond.
my influence doesn't reach nearly that far up.
then perhaps it's time to extend that influence.
I just got off the phone with the governor.
we were talking about your filling burke's senatorial seat until the next election.
me?
Kansas needs to be represented by someone of unassailable character who can restore the faith that burke has tarnished.
the governor agreed.
you are the perfect choice for the U. S. Senate.
Clark...
you agree?
you should do it, mom.
I think you should do it.
and I think dad would have wanted you to.
I-I can't move to washington.
we're barely keeping the farm running as it is.
Clark can take care of that. Can't you, clark?
I could lease out the back 40 to ben hubbard.
he's been wanting to work that land for years.
Oh, clark.
you and dad always taught me to put other people first, to use my abilities to help those in need.
you have the chance to affect so many people, to change so many lives if you go to washington.
that's where you need to be if you really want to make a difference, mom.
and it's where people like wes need you to be.
I don't care what it takes.
I want the body transported to the lab immediately.
make it happen.
Hey, you're up.
for a while now.
you never came home last night.
there was an unforeseen complication with project ares.
Ares?
the secret military project I was discussing with senator burke yesterday...
when you were listening outside the door.
Lex, I'm sorry.
there is no excuse.
my curiosity got the best of me.
you're not a cat, lana.
don't skulk around like one.
it won't happen again.
every time I've opened my heart to someone I care about,
I've ended up being very disappointed.
if
if you ever betrayed me...
I don't know what I'd do.
I'd never hurt the man I love.
of course not.
but if there's anything you ever want to know about my business dealings...
just ask.
no secrets?
no secrets.
Mrs. Kent goes to washington.
well, if anyone can give jimmy stewart a run for his money...
I just wish lionel wasn't helping her.
what, you think the king of ulterior motives may have something up his armani sleeve?
when doesn't he?
just, right now, his son's a bigger problem.
that's the understatement of the century.
I mean, we've always known lex has a dark side, but with what he's been doing recently, we're headed towards pitch black.
I want to make sure that lana's nowhere near him when the lights go out.
hopefully, he'll be behind bars long before that.
I mean, lois is meeting the feds at the morgue.
and once they connect wes' body with lex and then burke's murder.
don't hold your breath.
Wes' body's gone.
what about the feds?
what did they say when you told them what happened?
I work at the inquisitor
you know, aliens, bigfoot, elvis.
what do you think they said?
as far as they're concerned, wes keenan died in action four months ago.
just like it said in his file.
he deserved better than this.
Lois, I'm sorry.
don't be sorry for me.
be sorry for lex.
he's gonna pay for what he did to wes, and I'm gonna make damn sure that he doesn't do this to anyone else.
you were almost perfect.
take him apart.
I want to know exactly what went wrong so we don't make the same mistake next time.
Quantitating the abnormality won't do us any good, mr. Luthor.
we used up nearly everything we harvested from titan.
there aren't enough alien peptide sequences to continue the project.
I'm already working on procuring a replacement.
I promise you, doctor, this isn't the end of project ares.
this is just the beginning.
Lois, YOU'VE HAD A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE.
you SHOULD BE RESTING.
what ARE WE DOING OUT HERE?
I'm GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT LEX IS UP TO.
Clark, YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ATTEND.
after WHAT HAPPENED TO LANA,
why DON'T YOU TAKE UP CHLOE'S OFFER AND HANG OUT WITH HER AT THE TALON?
it's DANGEROUS OUT HERE.
and IT SEEMS THAT KEEPING YOU OUT OF TROUBLE HAS BECOME A BAD HABIT OF MINE.
besides, IT GIVES ME A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SAY GOODBYE.
you CAN'T BREAK UP WITH ME, CLARK.
we're NOT EVEN A COUPLE.
Lois, I'M LEAVING SMALLVILLE...
after LANA'S FUNERAL.
wow, DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.
where ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY TO?
up NORTH. THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO DO.
well, WHAT ABOUT THE FARM?
you CAN'T JUST LET THE CORN DIE ON THE VINE.
my NEIGHBOR BEN HUBBARD
he's GONNA RUN THINGS FOR A WHILE.
what's WRONG, LOIS?
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY TO GET RID OF ME.
are YOU KIDDING? WHO AM I GONNA PICK ON?
I'm SURE YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE.
now, WHICH DIRECTION DID YOU ENTER THE DAM FROM?
southeast. FOLLOW ME.
what IS THAT?
holy CRAP, THIS IS AMAZING.
check THIS OUT, CLARK.
Oh, MY GOD.
what DO YOU THINK IT IS?
Lois, IT'S PROBABLY JUST SOME SORT OF EXPERIMENTAL AIRPLANE.
then WHY AREN'T THERE ANY WINDOWS?
and THOSE SYMBOLS
they AREN'T LIKE ANY AIRLINE LOGOS I'VE EVER SEEN.
if YOU ASK ME,
we're LOOKING AT A REAL LIVE SPACESHIP.
come ON, LOIS.
you AND I BOTH KNOW THAT THEY DON'T REALLY EXIST.
and BASED ON THIS ALGAE,
it LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN UNDERWATER FOR A WHILE.
that's WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TOUCH MY STUFF.
go GET YOUR GIRLFRIEND...
and DON'T EVER COME BACK.
I'm SERIOUS. YOU NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
what? FOR THIS LITTLE BUMP?
my HEAD HAS BEEN BONKED A LOT HARDER THAN THAT.
Where's MY LAPTOP?
what HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?
you ARE GONNA WANT TO LOCK ME IN THE LOONY BIN
when I TELL YOU THIS,
but CLARK AND I JUST SAW A SPACESHIP.
Lois' IMAGINATION HAS FINALLY KICKED INTO OVERDRIVE.
it WAS PROBABLY JUST SOME SORT OF STYROFOAM PROP FOR A SCHOOL PLAY.
right. THAT MAKES SENSE, ACTUALLY.
okay, BUT THE WORLD I LIVE IN
school PROPS DON'T KNOCK PEOPLE UNCONSCIOUS.
I'm THINKING MAYBE A FORCE FIELD.
look, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU, LOIS?
you SLIPPED IN THE MUD AND HIT YOUR HEAD ON A ROCK.
I HELPED YOU TO YOUR FEET.
why DO YOU THINK I'VE GOT MUD ALL OVER ME?
I KNOW WHAT I SAW, SMALLVILLE,
and ONCE I CHANGE, I'M GOING STRAIGHT TO THE INQUISITOR.
my EDITOR IS GONNA FLIP.
tell ME SHE'S JUST SEEING THINGS.
it's WHAT SHE DIDN'T SEE, CHLOE
a KRYPTONIAN GIRL WITH BLOND HAIR AND A BAD ATTITUDE.
she MOVED SO FAST THAT LOIS DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIT HER.
a KRYPTONIAN ATTACKED LOIS?
Yeah, RIGHT BEFORE SHE CAME AFTER ME.
Chloe, NOT ONLY IS SHE AS STRONG AS I AM...
she CAN FLY.
whoa.
sounds LIKE WE GOT OURSELVES A TRUE-BLUE SUPERGIRL.
well, DEFINE SUPER.
nearly EVERY KRYPTONIAN THAT I'VE COME ACROSS
has TURNED INTO A COLD-BLOODED KILLER.
Yeah. WHAT IS IT WITH YOU PEOPLE?
are YOU THE ONLY HALF-DECENT MEMBER OF YOUR KRYPTONIAN RACE?
listen, I GOT TO GO BACK TO THE DAM.
if YOU CAN
wow, A LOT OF PAINKILLERS
for SOMEONE WHO'S NOT FEELING ANY PAIN.
it's JUST A LITTLE HEADACHE.
by THE TIME I GET BACK TO THE INQUISITOR,
I'll BE GOOD AS GOLD.
you've LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.
you COULD VERY WELL HAVE A CONCUSSION.
well, I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF I'M SEEING DOUBLE WHEN I'M TYPING MY STORY.
Lois, NO. I'M SORRY.
but AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER,
I'm NOT LETTING YOU PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER.
I'm TAKING YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.
okay.
but 10 MINUTES, AND THEN I'M GONE.
well, I'M GLAD SOMEONE HAS SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUT.
well, THIS SMILE MEANS
that YOU'VE BEEN CLEARED OF ALL CHARGES.
you're A FREE MAN, MR. LUTHOR.
on WHAT GROUNDS?
they CAUGHT THE KILLER.
a DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE FROM YOUR TUNNEL-CONSTRUCTION CREW
claimed HE GOT CANCER FROM THE CHEMICALS DOWN THERE.
he BLEW UP MY WIFE TO GET BACK AT ME?
that's WHAT HE SAID IN HIS CONFESSION.
come ON. LET'S GET OUT OF THIS CAGE.
I'll BUY YOU A BIG, JUICY PORTERHOUSE.
he DIDN'T DO IT.
Lex, THEY FOUND HIS FINGERPRINTS AT THE SCENE.
he CONFESSED TO THE CRIME.
I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF EVIDENCE THERE IS.
the MAN DID NOT MURDER MY WIFE.
as YOUR ATTORNEY -AS MY ATTORNEY,
I WANT YOU TO SET UP A MEETING
with THIS DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE.
I WANT TO HEAR IT FROM HIM.
what's THE POINT?
I'm NOT SURE LANA'S DEAD.
move ALONG, SIR. THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.
Lex, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
sharpening YOUR SHIV BEHIND BARS BY NOW.
someone ELSE CONFESSED.
once AGAIN, A LUTHOR SNAKE
manages TO SLITHER AWAY FROM THE GRIP OF JUSTICE.
how MUCH DID YOU HAVE TO PAY THIS POOR GUY?
I DIDN'T PAY HIM ANYTHING.
apparently, MY FATHER DID BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED.
the MAN WHO CONFESSED HAPPENS TO BE DYING OF CANCER.
he WANTED HIS FAMILY TAKEN CARE OF.
it DOESN'T MATTER WHAT LEGAL SLEIGHT OF HAND YOU PULLED THIS TIME, LEX - IT'S NOT BRINGING LANA BACK.
what IF SHE ISN'T DEAD, CHLOE?
Lex, YOU'RE ALREADY FREE.
you DON'T NEED TO KEEP COMING UP WITH MORE CONVOLUTED CONSPIRACY THEORIES.
as YOU PROBABLY KNOW, BEFORE LANA "DIED,"
she MANAGED TO STEAL HIGHLY CLASSIFIED RESEARCH FROM ME.
Lana's REMAINS HAVE ALL BEEN POSITIVELY I. D.'D
down TO EVERY LAST STRAND OF DNA.
I'm WELL AWARE OF THE DNA EVIDENCE.
look, CHLOE, YOU'RE LANA'S BEST FRIEND.
if SHE TOLD ANYONE ABOUT HER PLAN, IT WOULD BE YOU.
tell ME, CHLOE.
tell ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.
here's EVERYTHING I KNOW, LEX.
you NEED SOME RIOUS PSYCHIATRY.
Hey, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
uh, YEAH, I'M FINE.
but YOUR LITTLE KRYPTONIAN GAL PAL'S
been SHOWING UP ALL OVER LOWELL COUNTY.
have YOU SEEN HER SINCE SHE WENT ALL SPACE-SHUTTLE?
no, BUT I FOUND HER VICTIMS
two DEAD PARK RANGERS RIGHT WHERE HER SHIP USED TO BE.
I NEED TO FIND HER BEFORE SHE HURTS SOMEONE ELSE.
well, I-I THINK SHE'S STILL GROUNDED,
considering THESE 911 CALLS COMING IN.
three DIFFERENT PRESCHOOLS CALLED AND REPORTED
some BLOND WOMAN STORMING IN, SCARING THE CHILDREN.
where WAS SHE LAST SEEN?
can't CATCH ME!
what's YOUR NAME?
it's OKAY. I WON'T HURT YOU.
what ABOUT YOU? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
whatever YOU'RE DOING, IT STOPS NOW.
you AGAIN. YOU FOLLOWING ME?
humans CAN'T MOVE THAT FAST.
who ARE YOU?
doesn't MATTER.
not GONNA LET YOU KILL ONE MORE PERSON.
I HAVEN'T KILLED ANYONE
at LEAST NOT YET.
but YOU'RE STARTING TO TEMPT ME.
you WANT TO TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON EARTH?
you CAN TRUST ME.
looking FOR A SMALL BOY.
I've SEARCHED EVERYWHERE WITH NO LUCK.
this BOY HAVE A NAME?
Lois, A STORY ABOUT A SPACESHIP
is NOT GONNA SEND YOUR CAREER INTO THE STRATOSPHERE.
it'll EMBARRASS YOU.
it's THE TRUTH, CHLOE. I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.
Lois, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAW.
besides, I'M STILL TRYING TO RESUSCITATE MY CREDIBILITY
after WRITING ABOUT THE SMALLVILLE BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT SET.
we ARE TALKING ABOUT AN ALIEN INVASION.
two MEN ARE DEAD.
if YOU WERE THERE,
you'd BE CLACKING AWAY ON THE KEYBOARD AS WE SPEAK.
not NOW.

a STORY THAT WILL SELL PAPERS,
and YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A JOB HERE.
are YOU SERIOUS?
do I SOUND LIKE I'M JOKING?
you CAN'T BE KAL-EL.
he's A SWEET, CHUBBY BABY
who LAUGHED WHEN YOU TICKLED HIS FEET.
you KNEW ME ON KRYPTON?
Yeah. I USED TO WATCH OVER YOU.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I MEAN, I LEFT THE PLANET RIGHT AFTER YOU.
we WERE ON THE SAME TRAJECTORY.
your SHIP
it SEEMED TO BE UNDERWATER FOR A LONG TIME.
you MUST HAVE CRASH-LANDED DURING THE METEOR SHOWER INTO THE RESERVOIR.
when THE DAM BROKE, IT FINALLY BROUGHT YOU TO THE SURFACE.
how LONG WAS I IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION?
18 YEARS.
my IMBEDDED LEARNING PROGRAMS COVERED A LOT OF SCENARIOS,
but THIS CLEARLY WASN'T ONE OF THEM.
Kara, WHY ARE YOU SEARCHING FOR ME?
my FATHER, ZOR-EL, TOLD ME TO FIND YOU.
that WAS MY MISSION.
Zor-el AND JOR-EL ARE BROTHERS.
then THAT MAKES US...
cousins.
Jor-El NEVER MENTIONED YOUR DAD.
he AND HIS BROTHER NEVER TALKED.
Why?
the HOUSE OF EL HAS A LOT OF FAMILY SECRETS
that NOBODY EVER DISCUSSED.
as HUMANS WOULD SAY, WE WERE...
dysfunctional.
but I'M SURE YOU HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS,
but RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO FIND MY SHIP.
I'd DO IT MYSELF,
but THOSE GREEN ROCKS - THEY KEEP WEAKENING ME.
and TRUST ME - YOU WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM.
if YOU'RE AROUND THEM TOO LONG, THEY CAN KILL YOU.
kill ME?
Zor-el TOLD ME THAT THE YELLOW SUN
would GIVE ME ABILITIES BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS,
but HE DEFINITELY NEVER MENTIONED ANY FATAL WEAKNESSES.
it's BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW.
the GREEN ROCKS, THEY'RE CALLED KRYPTONITE
radioactive PIECES OF OUR HOME WORLD.
how DID PIECES OF KRYPTON TRAVEL 23 GALAXIES?
you DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AFTER YOU LEFT.
well, I KNOW WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL CIVIL WAR LED BY GENERAL ZOD.
Zor-el TOLD ME THAT KRYPTON'S SALVATION WAS ON EARTH
and THAT YOU AND I WERE THE KEY.
I HOPE WE'RE NOT TOO LATE.
Kara, KRYPTON IS GONE.
what DO YOU MEAN, "GONE"?
it EXPLODED.
you AND I ARE THE ONLY SURVIVORS.
no.
planets DON'T JUST EXPLODE, KAL-EL.
ours DID.
I'm SORRY.
no.
this YELLOW SUN HAS FRIED YOUR BRAIN CELLS.
come ON. HELP ME FIND MY SHIP.
we CAN HIDE IT HERE ON YOUR FARM.
your SHIP'S MISSING.
if IT'S MISSING, THEN HUMANS TOOK IT.
Kal-El, IF ANYONE BUT ME TRIES TO OPEN THAT SHIP,
it WILL ACTIVATE THE SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE.
define SELF-DESTRUCT.
I THINK YOU CALL IT SOMETHING LIKE A...
nuclear EXPLOSION.
there WAS NO SIGN OF ALIEN LIFE NEAR THAT SITE
none WHATSOEVER.
open IT.
surface TEMPERATURE RISING STEADILY.
begin EXTRACTION PROTOCOL. PREPARE TO EVACUATE NOW.
we DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME, PEOPLE.
lane, I HAD A FEELING YOU WORKED FAST,
but I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A LIGHTNING BOLT.
you GOT PAGES FOR ME?
actually, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.
I'm NOT INTERESTED IN TALK. I WANT TO READ.
look, CHLOE SULLIVAN SHOULD WRITE THIS STORY.
she's ALREADY ON YOUR STAFF.
and LET'S FACE IT, SHE CAN WRITE CIRCLES AROUND ME.
I KNOW SHE'S FAMILY, LANE,
but CHLOE SULLIVAN'S LOST HER MOJO.
now SHE'S JUST ANOTHER RUN-OF-THE-MILL HACK
giving HERSELF CARPAL TUNNEL
covering CITY HALL AND FOURTH-OF-JULY PARADES.
look, MY COUSIN'S FEELINGS MEAN A LOT MORE TO ME THAN SOME STUPID ARTICLE.
your COUSIN'S FEELINGS? HOW SWEET.
let ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, LANE.
newspapers DON'T HAVE FEELINGS.
they HAVE STORIES,
and STORIES ARE WHAT PAY THE BILLS AROUND HERE.
you THINK I'M BEING HONORED BY THE PUBLISHERS GUILD TONIGHT
because I'M MAHATMA GANDHI,
because I GIVE A DAMN ABOUT FEELINGS?
no. I BREAK STORIES ANY WAY, ANY HOW.
well, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BREAK THIS ONE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
this ISN'T ABOUT YOUR COUSIN.
this SO-CALLED FLYING-SAUCER STORY
it's ALL SMOKE AND MIRRORS.
you're USING SOME HIGH MORAL GROUND
to BAIL OUT OF A SINKING SHIP.
this SHIP IS FAR FROM SUNK, BOW TIE.
I HAPPEN TO HAVE A CONTACT IN THE AIR FORCE
who SUPPLIED ME WITH THESE.
they're SATELLITE PHOTOS SHOWING A CARAVAN OF TRUCKS
driving FROM THE DAM TO A GRAIN SILO IN GRANVILLE.
does THAT LOOK LIKE SMOKE AND MIRRORS TO YOU?
no.
it LOOKS LIKE PASSION,
and IT'S WHAT SEPARATES YOU FROM THE REST OF THE PACK.
this IS THE FORK IN YOUR ROAD, LANE.
in A DOZEN YEARS, YOU'LL EITHER BE LOIS LANE, STAR REPORTER WHOSE NAME IS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE DAILY PLANET,
or LOIS FILL-IN-THE-BLANK,
married TO AN INSURANCE ADJUSTER IN THE STICKS
with FOUR KIDS AND 40 EXTRA POUNDS.
you WON'T BE ABLE TO LOOK IN A NEWSPAPER
because IT WILL ALWAYS REMIND YOU OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN.
which ROAD SOUNDS BETTER TO YOU?
what DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?
we APPLIED VOICE-RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
and, USING OUR SATELLITES, CAST A NET
over EVERY LANDLINE AND CELLPHONE ON THE GLOBE.
I DON'T CARE HOW WIDE YOUR NET IS.
if YOU DON'T FIND LANA,
it's NOT WORTH THE STRING IT'S MADE OF.
we HAVE A MAP, SIR. SHE'S IN ASIA.
where? CHINA.
our GPS PUTS HER JUST A FEW MILES FROM CENTRAL SHANGHAI.
prepare THE JET FOR TAKEOFF.
Yes, SIR.
those DOORS WOULD HAVE OPENED IF YOU'D HAVE JUST WAITED.
we DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT FOR ANCIENT TECHNOLOGY.
between THE TWO OF US, WE CAN COVER MORE GROUND.
of COURSE, IT WOULD HELP IF YOU COULD DEFY GRAVITY.
explain TO ME AGAIN WHY YOU CAN'T FLY.
I'm NOT SURE.
I GUESS THE HUMANS ARE RIGHT, KAL-EL.
girls DO MATURE FASTER THAN BOYS.
it's CLARK, REMEMBER?
just START WALKING. DON'T LOOK BACK.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU WERE CLARK'S COUSIN
from ALL THE PRIMARY COLORS.
do YOU KNOW WHERE MY SHIP IS?
KAL-EL'S GETTING ME NOWHERE.
it's CLARK.
we've CHECKED EVERY LUTHORCORP FACILITY IN THE AREA.
do YOU HAVE ANY LEADS?
unfortunately, NOT TOO MANY EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLES
are ACTUALLY REGISTERED AT THE DMV.
I HAVE NOTHING.
I TOLD YOU COMING HERE WAS A WASTE OF TIME.
she's JUST A HUMAN.
a HUMAN WHO'S SMARTER THAN BOTH OF US COMBINED.
look, I'M SORRY, CLARK,
but THIS NEW EDITOR IS BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.
he WANTS SOME BIG, SPLASHY STORY,
and ALL I COULD COME UP WITH
is THE SUDDEN LOSS OF AM/FM RADIO IN GRANVILLE.
I'm OUT OF HERE.
I'll JUST DO A FLYOVER
and START X-RAYING EVERY SINGLE BUILDING.
Kara, WAIT.
your SHIP - DOES IT EMIT ANY SORT OF FREQUENCY?
well, YEAH. IF IT'S OPENED, THERE'S AN ALARM.
could THAT ALARM BE DISRUPTING THE AM/FM RADIOS?
Kal-El, IF THAT ALARM'S BEEN TRIGGERED,
I'm THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DISARM IT.
what ARE WE DOING UP HERE? TIME'S RUNNING OUT.
look, YOU COVER THE GROUNDS. I'LL GET THE BIRD'S-EYE VIEW.
what DOES YOUR SHIP SOUND LIKE?
what?
if YOUR SHIP IS EMITTING AN ALARM, THEN YOU CAN HEAR IT,
even IF IT'S MILES AWAY.
it's ONE OF OUR ABILITIES ON EARTH.
you HAVE TO FOCUS. BLOCK EVERYTHING ELSE OUT.
just TRY.
all I HEAR IS THE WIND.
close YOUR EYES. IT MIGHT HELP.
try TO FOCUS.
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.
just TRY TO LISTEN TO ALL THE SOUNDS AROUND YOU.
make IT STOP.
Oh, MAKE IT STOP.
listen. LISTEN.
I KNOW IT'S LOUD AT FIRST, BUT YOU HAVE TO FOCUS, OKAY?
eliminate THE SOUNDS ONE BY ONE
until ALL YOU CAN HEAR IS YOUR SHIP.
Kal-El, I - I CAN HEAR IT.
then WE CAN FIND IT.
I KNEW THOSE ROADBLOCKS I SLIPPED PAST
weren't THERE FOR JUST A CHEMICAL SPILL.
they EVACUATED THE AREA
because OF WHAT'S DOWN HERE UNDERGROUND.
and JUDGING BY THAT FUNKY SOUND
and THE MEGAWATT LIGHT SHOW,
something IS GOING ON BEHIND THAT DOOR,
and IT'S NOT LASERIUM.
Oh, MY GOD.
it's OFFICIAL.
I FOUND THE HOLY GRAIL.
Uh-oh.
are YOU OKAY?
my SHIP - IT'S GONE.
what ARE WE GONNA DO?
that's THE LAST TIME YOU'LL EVER TOUCH ME.
do YOU REALLY THINK I COULD JUST LET YOU WALK AWAY?
what ARE YOU GOING TO DO, LEX...
kill ME?
that's THE LAST TIME YOU'LL EVER TOUCH ME.
do YOU REALLY THINK I COULD JUST LET YOU WALK AWAY?
what ARE YOU GOING TO DO, LEX...
kill ME?
that's THE LAST TIME YOU'LL EVER TOUCH ME.
do YOU REALLY THINK I COULD JUST LET YOU WALK AWAY?
what ARE YOU GOING TO DO, LEX?
I'm IMPRESSED.
I DID LEARN FROM THE MASTER.
as SOON AS I HEARD YOU'D FREED YOURSELF,
I LAID OUT THE BREADCRUMBS
and WAITED FOR THE WOLF TO COME KNOCKING.
tell ME, LEX.
how WERE YOU PLANNING ON GETTING YOUR REVENGE?
Lana, IF I WANTED REVENGE,
we WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.
I've COME HERE TO BEG FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.
with A GUN POINTED AT YOUR HEAD,
you'll SAY ANYTHING, WON'T YOU?
the THINGS I DID TO YOU WERE BEYOND INEXCUSABLE.
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR WANTING TO RUIN MY LIFE.
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING...
only NOT AS ELEGANT.
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE SMART, LANA.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE BRILLIANT...
using MY OWN SCIENCE AGAINST ME.
it WASN'T SCIENCE, LEX.
it WAS YOUR OWN PSYCHOSIS.
you CLONED ME.
not EXACTLY.
model 503 WAS NEVER ALIVE.
that's WHY YOU WERE ABLE TO WHEEL IT OUT OF MY LAB
and PLACE IT IN YOUR DRIVER'S SEAT.
by THE TIME THE CAR EXPLODED,
you WERE SAFE AND SOUND
while MODEL 503, WITH YOUR DNA, WAS BEING BLOWN TO BITS.
it WAS PERFECT.
as FAR AS THE WORLD'S CONCERNED,
Lana LUTHOR IS DEAD AND BURIED.
and A DEAD WOMAN CAN'T BE CONVICTED OF MURDER.
you'll NEVER HURT ANOTHER PERSON AGAIN, LEX.
I DON'T WANT TO.
don't COME ANY CLOSER.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A BETTER TARGET.
after ALL THE PAIN I'VE PUT YOU THROUGH, I DESERVE TO DIE.
please, LANA. PULL THE TRIGGER.
I PROMISE YOU THE WORLD WILL BE A BETTER PLACE.
do IT.
kill ME.
if YOU WANT TO COME BACK TO SMALLVILLE, YOU'LL BE SAFE.
I'll TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.
you CAN LIVE YOUR LIFE HOWEVER YOU WANT.
my FATHER'S GONE, PRESUMED DEAD.
and AS FOR ME...
I WOULD NEVER, EVER HURT YOU AGAIN.
I'm SORRY, LANA.
there AREN'T ANY MATTRESSES TO BREAK YOUR FALL.
to THINK I COULD HAVE LANDED A JOB AT THE DAILY PLANET.
what A JOKE.
I AM NO CHLOE SULLIVAN AND NEVER WILL BE.
lane, I JUST READ YOUR STORY.
it's RIDICULOUS.
it WAS JUST HER FIRST DRAFT, MR. GABRIEL.
it's ABSURD HOW GOOD IT IS.
your PROSE LEAPS OFF THE PAGE LIKE A BENGAL TIGER.
I WAS RIVETED.
so, YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA RUN IT?
absolutely NOT. IT'S UTTERLY UNPRINTABLE.
I DON'T CARE IF EVERY WORD OF IT IS TRUE.
I CAN'T RUN A STORY ABOUT A SHIP FROM OUTER SPACE
without A PHOTO.
you GOT TO LEARN, LANE. ALWAYS CARRY A BACKUP CAMERA.
if YOU WOULD JUST GIVE HER A SECOND CHANCE
you LIKE WATER, LANE?
as MUCH AS THE NEXT GIRL.
I'm GIVING YOU A WATERFRONT VIEW.
this IS YOUR NEW DESK RIGHT HERE,
right ACROSS FROM COUSIN CHLOE.
excuse ME?
if YOU'RE LUCKY, SULLIVAN,
some OF HER PASSION WILL RUB OFF ON YOU,
maybe PUT A LITTLE FIRE ON THAT TORCH
you LET BURN OUT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL.
am I HEARING THINGS,
or DID YOU JUST OFFER ME A JOB?
welcome TO THE DAILY PLANET, LOIS LANE.
you PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT,
you'll BE OUT OF THIS BASEMENT QUICKER THAN YOUR COUSIN.
nothing LIKE A LITTLE FAMILY RIVALRY TO KEEP THE BULLPEN HOPPING.
you OKAY?
how DID IT HAPPEN?
Krypton, I MEAN.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'd ALWAYS HEARD WHISPERS OF A DOOMSDAY SCENARIO,
but I NEVER THOUGHT ANYONE WOULD ACTUALLY DO IT.
we WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
the MOST ADVANCED CIVILIZATION IN THE GALAXY.
one THING I'VE LEARNED
is THAT EVIL EXISTS IN ALL CULTURES,
no MATTER HOW ADVANCED THEY ARE.
maybe IF I HAD HAD MY ABILITIES ON KRYPTON,
I COULD HAVE SAVED IT.
you SAVED A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE TODAY.
you SHOULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT.
it's DIFFERENT FOR YOU, KAL-EL.
you DON'T HAVE ANY MEMORY OF KRYPTON.
this HAS ALWAYS BEEN YOUR HOME.
well, THEN, BE MY MEMORY.
tell ME ABOUT MY FAMILY.
it's HAZY FROM ALL THOSE YEARS OF SLEEP IN THE SHIP.
I DO REMEMBER SOME.
I USED TO, UH, SNEAK AWAY FROM KANDOR
and COME AND SEE LORA.
she ALWAYS MADE ME SMILE.
you KNEW MY MOM?
the DAY SHE FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT,
I'd NEVER SEEN HER SO HAPPY.
you WERE SO CUTE.
you WERE HER MIRACLE BABY.
and NOW SHE'S GONE.
my PARENTS ARE GONE,
the ENTIRE HOUSE OF EL.
I'll NEVER SEE ANY OF MY FAMILY EVER AGAIN.
well, YOU'RE WITH FAMILY NOW.
look, YOU CAN STAY HERE WITH ME
on THE FARM AS LONG AS YOU WANT.
you KNOW, THESE HUMANS ARE NOT AS BAD AS YOU THINK.
thank YOU, KAL-EL.
I MEAN, CLARK.
I JUST WISH I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SUCH A FAILURE.
I MADE MY FATHER A PROMISE, AND I COULDN'T KEEP IT.
Kara, THAT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
we CAN'T ALWAYS BE EVERYTHING OUR FATHERS EXPECT US TO BE.
I KNOW THAT FIRSTHAND.
the WAY HE SPOKE OF THE CRYSTAL
he TOLD ME TO GUARD IT WITH MY LIFE,
and NOW IT'S GONE.
wait, THERE'S A CRYSTAL IN THAT SHIP?
with ALL OF MY DIRECTIVES
and THE POWER TO HELP ME ALONG THE WAY.
if THAT CRYSTAL FELL INTO THE WRONG HANDS,
it COULD BE DISASTROUS.
luckily, WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
since IT WAS DESTROYED WITH THE SHIP.
no. THAT EXPLOSION WOULDN'T SCRATCH THE CRYSTAL.
only A KRYPTONIAN CAN DESTROY IT.
I've SEARCHED EVERYWHERE.
that CRYSTAL IS GONE.
hmm.
the SPACECRAFT WAS EVISCERATED,
but ALL IS NOT LOST.
Kal-El, MY SON,
you HAVE FINALLY CHOSEN TO START YOUR TRAINING.
a KRYPTONIAN GIRL SHOWED UP AT MY DOORSTEP.
her NAME IS KARA.
last TIME THAT HAPPENED, YOU WERE BEHIND IT.
I KNOW NOTHING OF HER ARRIVAL.
she SAYS SHE WAS SENT HERE BY HER FATHER, ZOR-EL.
you MIGHT REMEMBER HIM, SINCE HE'S YOUR BROTHER.
care TO TELL ME WHY YOU IGNORED THAT BRANCH OF THE FAMILY TREE?
whatever ZOR-EL WANTED WITH YOU,
it WAS NOT FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF KRYPTON.
he COULD NOT BE TRUSTED,
and NEITHER CAN HIS DAUGHTER.
you CAN'T BLAME KARA FOR THE ACTIONS OF HER FATHER.
she's NOT HERE TO CAUSE ANY HARM.
that IS AN EMOTIONAL, HUMAN REACTION.
be CAREFUL OF YOUR FEELINGS, KAL-EL.
they CAN BETRAY YOU.
my FEELINGS ARE PART OF WHO I AM,
whether YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.
now, WHAT ABOUT MY TRAINING?
your TRAINING STARTS WITH KARA.
watch OVER HER, KAL-EL.
she POSES A GREATER THREAT THAN YOU BELIEVE.
Mr. LUTHOR.
I TAKE IT YOU FOUND WHO YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.
there's SOMEONE ELSE I NEED YOU TO LOCATE.
this DRAWING ISN'T MUCH TO GO ON, SIR.
it's ALL I HAVE.
that WOMAN SAVED MY LIFE.
use WHATEVER RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY TO FIND HER.
is THAT CLEAR?
Yes, SIR.
Lois, you've had a near-death experience.
you should be resting.
what are we doing out here?
I'm going to find out what Lex is up to.
Clark, you, on the other hand, are not required to attend.
after what happened to Lana,
why don't you take up Chloe's offer and hang out with her at the Talon?
it's dangerous out here.
and it seems that keeping you out of trouble has become a bad habit of mine.
besides, it gives me a good opportunity to say goodbye.
you can't break up with me, Clark.
we're not even a couple.
Lois, I'm leaving Smallville after Lana's funeral.
wow, didn't see that coming.
where are you running away to?
up north. There's something I need to do.
well, what about the farm? You can't just let the corn die on the vine.
my neighbor Ben Hubbard - He's gonna run things for a while.
what's wrong, Lois?
I thought you'd be happy to get rid of me.
are you kidding? Who am I gonna pick on?
I'm sure you'll find someone.
now, which direction did you enter the dam from?
southeast. Follow me.
what is that?
holy crap, this is amazing.
check this out, Clark.
Oh, my god.
what do you think it is?
Lois, it's probably just some sort of experimental airplane.
then why aren't there any windows?
and those symbols
they aren't like any airline logos I've ever seen.
if you ask me,
we're looking at a real live spaceship.
come on, Lois.
you and I both know that they don't really exist.
and based on this algae, It looks like it's been underwater for a while.
that's what happens when you touch my stuff.
go get your girlfriend...
and don't ever come back.
belle Reve santitarium
I'm serious. You need to go to the hospital.
what? For this little bump?
my head has been bonked a lot harder than that.
Where's my laptop?
what happened to you guys?
you are gonna want to lock me in the loony bin when I tell you this,
but clark and I just saw a spaceship.
Lois' imagination has finally kicked into overdrive.
it was probably just some sort of styrofoam prop for a school play.
right. That makes sense, actually.
okay, but the world I live in
school props don't knock people unconscious.
I'm thinking maybe a force field.
look, how many times do I have to tell you, Lois?
you slipped in the mud and hit your head on a rock.
I helped you to your feet. Why do you think I've got mud all over me?
I know what I saw, smallville,
and once I change, I'm going straight to the inquisitor.
my editor is gonna flip.
tell me she's just seeing things.
it's what she didn't see, chloe
a kryptonian girl with blond hair and a bad attitude.
she moved so fast that Lois didn't even know what hit her.
a kryptonian attacked Lois?
Yeah, right before she came after me.
Chloe, not only is she as strong as i am...
she can fly.
whoa.
sounds like we got ourselves a true-blue super girl.
well, define super.
nearly every kryptonian that I've come across has turned into a cold-blooded killer.
Yeah. What is it with you people?
are you the only half-decent member of your kryptonian race?
listen, I got to go back to the dam. If you can
wow, a lot of painkillers for someone who's not feeling any pain.
it's just a little headache.
by the time I get back to the inquisitor, I'll be good as gold.
you've lost consciousness. You could very well have a concussion.
well, I'll let you know if I'm seeing double when I'm typing my story.
Lois, no. I'm sorry.
but after everything we've just been through together,
I'm not letting you put yourself in danger.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
okay.
but 10 minutes, and then I'm gone.
well, I'm glad someone has something to smile about.
well, this smile means that you've been cleared of all charges.
you're a free man, Mr. Luthor.
on what grounds?
they caught the killer.
a disgruntled employee from your tunnel-construction crew
claimed he got cancer from the chemicals down there.
he blew up my wife to get back at me?
that's what he said in his confession.
come on. Let's get out of this cage.
I'll buy you a big, juicy porterhouse.
he didn't do it.
Lex, they found his fingerprints at the scene.
he confessed to the crime.
I don't care what kind of evidence there is.
the man did not murder my wife.
as your attorney -as my attorney,
I want you to set up a meeting with this disgruntled employee.
I want to hear it from him.
what's the point?
I'm not sure Lana's dead.
move along, sir. This is a crime scene.
Lex, I thought you'd be sharpening your shiv behind bars by now.
someone else confessed.
once again, a Luthor snake manages to slither away from the grip of justice.
how much did you have to pay this poor guy?
I didn't pay him anything.
apparently, my father did before he disappeared.
the man who confessed happens to be dying of cancer.
he wanted his family taken care of.
it doesn't matter what legal sleight of hand you pulled this time, Lex
it's not bringing Lana back.
what if she isn't dead, Chloe?
Lex, you're already free.
you don't need to keep coming up with more convoluted conspiracy theories.
as you probably know, before Lana "died,"
she managed to steal highly classified research from me.
Lana's remains have all been positively i. d.'d
down to every last strand of DNA.
I'm well aware of the DNA evidence.
look, Chloe, you're Lana's best friend.
if she told anyone about her plan, it would be you.
tell me, Chloe.
tell me everything you know.
here's everything I know, Lex.
you need some rious psychiatry.
Hey, are you all right?
uh, yeah, I'm fine.
but your little kryptonian gal pal's been showing up all over Lowell county.
have you seen her since she went all space-shuttle?
no, but I found her victims
two dead park rangers right where her ship used to be.
I need to find her before she hurts someone else.
well, I-I think she's still grounded, considering these 911 calls coming in.
three different preschools called and reported
some blond woman storming in, scaring the children.
where was she last seen?
what's your name?
it's okay. I won't hurt you.
Cody.
what about you? What's your name?
whatever you're doing, it stops now.
you again. You following me?
humans can't move that fast.
who are you?
doesn't matter.
not gonna let you kill one more person.
I haven't killed anyone
at least not yet.
but you're starting to tempt me.
you want to tell me what you're doing on earth?
you can trust me.
looking for a small boy.
I've searched everywhere with no luck.
this boy have a name?
Kal-El.
Lois, a story about a spaceship is not gonna send your career into the stratosphere.
it'll embarrass you.
it's the truth, Chloe. I saw it with my own eyes.
Lois, you don't know what you saw.
besides, I'm still trying to resuscitate my credibility after writing about the Smallville Believe-It-Or-Not set.
we are talking about an alien invasion.
two men are dead.
if you were there,
you'd be clacking away on the keyboard as we speak.
not now.
the Daily Planet just hired a new editor wonder boy from the star city post.
and spaceships are not the stuff of good first impressions.
did I hear someone say spaceship?
didn't anyone teach you that eavesdropping is rude?
eavesdropping is my livelihood.
grant Gabriel - your new editor.
actually, she doesn't work here. I do.
I'm Chloe - Anne Sullivan,
former editor of the Smallville High Torch,
taking met u. Journalism classes by night
while writing filler stories sandwiched between sofa ads by day.
tell me about your close encounter.
can't share a trade secret.
I work for your rival, the Inquisitor.
our rival?
this is the Daily Planet,
read in virtually ever country across the globe.
we have no rival.
that's true.
besides, the Planet wouldn't publish a story like that anyway.
see, that's the kind of old-guard thinking
that's putting newspapers in the crapper all around this country.
since when is truth in journalism old guard?
well, she says it's true. I believe her.
I'll tell you what.
you deliver me your spaceship story, a story that will sell papers,
and you've got yourself a job here.
are you serious?
do I sound like I'm joking?
he's a sweet, chubby baby Who laughed when you tickled his feet.
you knew me on krypton?
Yeah. I used to watch over you.
I don't understand.
I mean, I left the planet right after you.
we were on the same trajectory.
your ship
it seemed to be underwater for a long time.
you must have crash-landed during the meteor shower into the reservoir.
when the dam broke, it finally brought you to the surface.
how long was I in suspended animation?
18 years.
my imbedded learning programs covered a lot of scenarios,
but this clearly wasn't one of them.
Kara, why are you searching for me?
my father, Zor-el, told me to find you.
that was my mission.
Zor-el?
Zor-el and Jor-el are brothers.
then that makes us...
cousins.
Jor-El never mentioned your dad.
he and his brother never talked.
Why?
the house of El has a lot of family secrets that nobody ever discussed.
as humans would say, we were...
dysfunctional.
but I'm sure you have a lot of questions,
but right now we need to find my ship.
I'd do it myself, but those green rocks - they keep weakening me.
and trust me - you want to stay away from them.
if you're around them too long, they can kill you.
kill me?
Zor-el told me that the yellow sun would give me abilities beyond my wildest dreams,
but he definitely never mentioned any fatal weaknesses.
it's because he didn't know.
the green rocks, they're called kryptonite
radioactive pieces of our home world.
how did pieces of krypton travel 23 galaxies?
you don't know what happened after you left.
well, I know we were in the midst of a global civil war led by general Zod.
Zor-el told me that krypton's salvation was on earth
and that you and I were the key.
I hope we're not too late.
Kara, krypton is gone.
what do you mean,"gone"?
it exploded.
you and I are the only survivors.
no.
planets don't just explode, Kal-el.
ours did.
I'm sorry.
no.
this yellow sun has fried your brain cells.
come on. Help me find my ship.
we can hide it here on your farm.
your ship's missing.
if it's missing, then humans took it.
Kal-El, if anyone but me tries to open that ship,
it will activate the self-destruct sequence.
define self-destruct.
I think you call it something like a...
nuclear explosion.
there was no sign of alien life near that site
none whatsoever.
open it.
surface temperature rising steadily.
begin extraction protocol. Prepare to evacuate now.
we don't have a lot of time, people.
lane, I had a feeling you worked fast,
but I didn't know you were a lightning bolt.
you got pages for me?
actually, I need to talk to you about that.
I'm not interested in talk. I want to read.
look, Chloe Sullivan should write this story.
she's already on your staff.
and let's face it, she can write circles around me.
I know she's family, Lane,
but Chloe Sullivan's lost her mojo.
now she's just another run-of-the-mill hack giving herself carpal tunnel
covering city hall and fourth-of-July parades.
look, my cousin's feelings mean a lot more to me than some stupid article.
your cousin's feelings? How sweet.
let me tell you something, Lane.
newspapers don't have feelings.
they have stories, and stories are what pay the bills around here.
you think I'm being honored by the publishers guild tonight
because I'm mahatma gandhi,
because I give a damn about feelings?
no. I break stories any way, any how.
well, you're gonna have to break this one with someone else.
this isn't about your cousin.
this so-called flying-saucer story
it's all smoke and mirrors.
you're using some high moral ground to bail out of a sinking ship.
this ship is far from sunk, bow tie.
I happen to have a contact in the air force who supplied me with these.
they're satellite photos showing a caravan of trucks
driving from the dam to a grain silo in Granville.
does that look like smoke and mirrors to you?
no. It looks like passion,
and it's what separates you from the rest of the pack.
this is the fork in your road, Lane.
in a dozen years, you'll either be Lois Lane, star reporter whose name is synonymous with the Daily Planet,
or Lois fill-in-the-blank,
married to an insurance adjuster in the sticks with four kids and 40 extra pounds.
you won't be able to look in a newspaper
because it will always remind you of what could have been.
which road sounds better to you?
what do you have for me?
we applied voice-recognition software
and, using our satellites, cast a net over every landline and cellphone on the globe.
I don't care how wide your net is.
if you don't find Lana, it's not worth the string it's made of.
we have a map, sir. She's in Asia.
where? - China.
our GPS puts her just a few miles from central Shanghai.
prepare the jet for takeoff.
Yes, sir.
those doors would have opened if you'd have just waited.
we don't have time to wait for ancient technology.
between the two of us, we can cover more ground.
of course, it would help if you could defy gravity.
explain to me again why you can't fly.
I'm not sure.
I guess the humans are right, Kal-el.
girls do mature faster than boys.
it's Clark, remember?
just start walking. Don't look back.
I should have known you were Clark's cousin from all the primary colors.
do you know where my ship is?
Kal-el's getting me nowhere.
it's Clark.
we've checked every Luthor corp facility in the area.
do you have any leads?
unfortunately, not too many extraterrestrial vehicles are actually registered at the DMV.
I have nothing.
I told you coming here was a waste of time.
she's just a human.
a human who's smarter than both of us combined.
look, I'm sorry, Clark,
but this new editor is breathing down my neck.
he wants some big, splashy story,
and all I could come up with is the sudden loss of am/fm radio in Granville.
I'm out of here.
I'll just do a flyover and start X-raying every single building.
Kara, wait.
your ship - does it emit any sort of frequency?
well, yeah. If it's opened, there's an alarm.
could that alarm be disrupting the am/fm radios?
Kal-El, if that alarm's been triggered,
I'm the only one who can disarm it.
what are we doing up here? Time's running out.
look, you cover the grounds. I'll get the bird's-eye view.
what does your ship sound like?
what?
if your ship is emitting an alarm, then you can hear it, even if it's miles away.
it's one of our abilities on earth.
you have to focus. Block everything else out.
just try.
all I hear is the wind.
close your eyes. It might help.
try to focus.
I know you can do it.
just try to listen to all the sounds around you.
make it stop.
Oh, make it stop.
listen. Listen.
I know it's loud at first, but you have to focus, okay?
eliminate the sounds one by one until all you can hear is your ship.
Kal-El, I - I can hear it.
then we can find it.
I knew those roadblocks I slipped past weren't there for just a chemical spill.
they evacuated the area because of what's down here underground.
and judging by that funky sound
and the megawatt light show,
something is going on behind that door,
and it's not laserium.
Oh, my god.
it's official.
I found the holy grail.
are you okay?
my ship
it's gone.
what are we gonna do?
that's the last time you'll ever touch me.
do you really think I could just let you walk away?
what are you going to do, Lex...
kill me?
that's the last time you'll ever touch me.
do you really think I could just let you walk away?
what are you going to do, Lex...
kill me?
that's the last time you'll ever touch me.
do you really thinkI could just let you walk away?
what are you going to do, Lex?
shanghai, China
I'm impressed.
I did learn from the master.
as soon as I heard you'd freed yourself,
I laid out the breadcrumbs and waited for the wolf to come knocking.
tell me, Lex.
how were you planning on getting your revenge?
Lana, if I wanted revenge,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.
I've come here to beg for your forgiveness.
with a gun pointed at your head, you'll say anything, won't you?
the things I did to you were beyond inexcusable.
I don't blame you for wanting to ruin my life.
I probably would have done the same thing...
only not as elegant.
I always knew you were smart, Lana.
I didn't know you were brilliant...
using my own science against me.
it wasn't science, Lex.
it was your own psychosis.
you cloned me.
not exactly.
model 503 was never alive.
that's why you were able to wheel it out of my lab
and place it in your driver's seat.
by the time the car exploded,
you were safe and sound while model 503, with your DNA, was being blown to bits.
it was perfect.
as far as the world's concerned,
Lana Luthor is dead and buried.
and a dead woman can't be convicted of murder.
you'll never hurt another person again, Lex.
I don't want to.
don't come any closer.
I want to give you a better target.
after all the pain I've put you through, I deserve to die.
please, Lana. Pull the trigger.
I promise you the world will be a better place. Do it.
kill me.
if you want to come back to Smallville, you'll be safe.
I'll take care of everything.
you can live your life however you want.
my father's gone, presumed dead. And as for me...
I would never, ever hurt you again.
I'm sorry, Lana.
there aren't any mattresses to break your fall.
to think I could have landed a job at the Daily Planet. What a joke.
I am no Chloe Sullivan and never will be.
lane, I just read your story. It's ridiculous.
what it was just her first draft, Mr. Gabriel.
it's absurd how good it is.
your prose leaps off the page like a bengal tiger. I was riveted.
so, you're actually gonna run it?
absolutely not. It's utterly unprintable.
I don't care if every word of it is true.
I can't run a story about a ship from outer space without a photo.
you got to learn, Lane. Always carry a backup camera.
if you would just give her a second chance
you like water, Lane?
as much as the next girl.
I'm giving you a waterfront view.
this is your new desk right here, right across from cousin Chloe.
excuse me?
if you're lucky, Sullivan, some of her passion will rub off on you,
maybe put a little fire on that torch you let burn out after high school.
am I hearing things,
or did you just offer me a job?
welcome to the Daily Planet, Lois Lane.
you play your cards right,
you'll be out of this basement quicker than your cousin.
nothing like a little family rivalry to keep the bullpen hopping.
Kara?
you okay?
how did it happen?
Krypton, I mean.
I don't know.
I'd always heard whispers of a doomsday scenario,
but I never thought anyone would actually do it.
we were supposed to be the most advanced civilization in the galaxy.
one thing I've learned
is that evil exists in all cultures,
no matter how advanced they are.
maybe if I had had my abilities on krypton, I could have saved it.
you saved a lot of people here today.
you should feel good about that.
it's different for you, Lal-el.
you don't have any memory of krypton.
this has always been your home.
well, then, be my memory.
tell me about my family.
it's hazy from all those years of sleep in the ship.
I do remember some.
I used to, uh, sneak away from Kandor and come and see Lora.
she always made me smile.
you knew my mom?
the day she found out she was pregnant,
I'd never seen her so happy.
you were so cute.
you were her miracle baby.
and now she's gone.
my parents are gone,
the entire house of El.
I'll never see any of my family ever again.
well, you're with family now.
look, you can stay here with me
on the farm as long as you want.
you know, these humans are not as bad as you think.
thank you, Kal-el.
I mean, Clark.
I just wish I didn't feel like such a failure.
I made my father a promise, and I couldn't keep it.
Kara, that wasn't your fault.
we can't always be everything our fathers expect us to be.
I know that firsthand.
the way he spoke of the crystal
he told me to guard it with my life, and now it's gone.
wait, there's a crystal in that ship?
with all of my directives and the power to help me along the way.
if that crystal fell into the wrong hands,
it could be disastrous.
luckily, we don't have to worry about that
since it was destroyed with the ship.
no.
that explosion wouldn't scratch the crystal.
only a kryptonian can destroy it.
I've searched everywhere.
that crystal is gone.
the spacecraft was eviscerated,
but all is not lost.
Departmeny
Kal-El, my son,
you have finally chosen to start your training.
a kryptonian girl showed up at my doorstep.
her name is kara.
last time that happened, you were behind it.
I know nothing of her arrival.
she says she was sent here by her father, Zor-el.
you might remember him, since he's your brother.
care to tell me why you ignored that branch of the family tree?
whatever Zor-el wanted with you,
it was not for the greater good of krypton.
he could not be trusted,
and neither can his daughter.
you can't blame Kara for the actions of her father.
she's not here to cause any harm.
that is an emotional, human reaction.
be careful of your feelings, Kal-el.
they can betray you.
my feelings are part of who I am, whether you like it or not.
now, what about my training?
your training starts with Kara.
watch over her, Kal-el.
she poses a greater threat than you believe.
Mr. Luthor.
I take it you found who you were looking for.
there's someone else I need you to locate.
this drawing isn't much to go on, sir.
it's all I have.
that woman saved my life.
use whatever resources are necessary to find her.
is that clear?
Yes, sir.
cut - put that??? - let's ???
okay, ???
??? - hey thanks ???
you know ???
at least ???
to shot ???
because ???
Oh, com on, who doesn't ???
I didn't ???
I'm not its just ???
I mean ???
who really ???
worring about ???
in OTHER WORDS, I'VE HAD PLENTY OF FREE TIME
to CREATE KARA'S FAKE BACKSTORY.
your COUSIN'S SECRET IDENTITY IS PRACTICALLY GOOGLE-PROOF.
that's GREAT.
maybe WHEN SHE CLEARS HER HEAD AND COMES HOME,
she'll APPRECIATE IT.
sorry, GUYS. GOT TO MOVE YOU BACK.
OK, place please
all THAT FOR ONE STAR.
Clark, RACHEL DAVENPORT IS NOT JUST A STAR.
she's PRACTICALLY HER OWN CONSTELLATION.
I MEAN, DON'T YOU WATCH MOVIES AT ALL?
turns OUT MISS SUPER DIVA PUT A MORATORIUM ON ALL PRESS INTERVIEWS.
God, AN EXCLUSIVE WITH HER
would DEFINITELY PUT A SNAP BACK INTO MY EDITOR'S SUSPENDERS.
and ROLL SOUND!
roll CAMERA!
here WE GO.
OK, ROLL PLAYBACK.
and...
...ACTION.
Steven, YOU WON'T BELIEVE THE PHOTOS I GOT US, BABY.
meet ME AT THE FRENCH PLACE IN AN HOUR.
good ???
cut.
that WAS PERFECT.
Rachel, that's a cut.
what THE HELL?
Rachel, THAT'S A CUT.
Oh, MY GOD.
is IT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THIS?
Oh, MY GOD! SOMEBODY HELP!
somebody HELP ME!
so, YOU JUST TOTALLY SAVED MY LIFE.
you're AMAZING.
Hey.
I CAN THINK OF OTHER WAYS TO BURN CALORIES.
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COME IN LAST NIGHT.
I KNOW.
you WERE ALREADY ASLEEP WHEN I GOT HOME FROM NELL'S.
and YOU LOOKED SO CUTE, I COULDN'T BEAR TO WAKE YOU.
but EVEN HEROES NEED THEIR BEAUTY SLEEP.
after YEARS OF THESE ARTICLES,
you'd THINK I WOULD HAVE FIGURED IT OUT.
I GUESS PEOPLE ONLY SEE WHAT THEY THINK IS POSSIBLE.
well, I, FOR ONE, AM GLAD I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT.
and I THINK THE SPOTLIGHT IS BETTER SUITED IN HOLLYWOOD.
ms. RACHEL DAVENPORT IS REQUESTING YOUR COMPANY ON THE SET.
looks LIKE I'M NOT YOUR ONLY FAN.
Rachel IS VERY BUSY, SO KEEP IT SHORT
and DON'T ASK FOR AN AUTOGRAPH.
no PROBLEM.
ms. DAVENPORT, YOUR GUEST HAS ARRIVED.
attention, EVERYONE.
Mr. KENT AND I NEED SOME ONE-ON-ONE.
thank YOU. SEE YOU ALL IN A LITTLE BIT.
today WE SHOOT THE FAMOUS DATE SCENE.
warrior ANGEL'S ABOUT TO STAND ME UP.
it's HEARTBREAKING.
in HIS DEFENSE, I'M SURE HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE.
anyway, I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU...
personally.
that WAS REALLY BRAVE, WHAT YOU DID.
after WHAT HAPPENED, I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE NOT IN THE HOSPITAL.
God, NO. I GOT MY START ON A MEDICAL DRAMA.
two SEASONS OF BAD MEMORIES.
you MEAN YOU HAVEN'T MEMORIZED MY ENTIRE ACTING REPERTOIRE?
you KNOW, I DON'T WATCH A LOT OF MOVIES.
Clark, I'M KIDDING.
Oh.
you KNOW, IT'S REFRESHING FOR SOMEONE TO SEE THE REAL ME,
not JUST THE TABLOID VERSION.
I'm SORRY TO INTERRUPT, MS. DAVENPORT,
but THIS GIRL SAID SHE ABSOLUTELY NEEDED TO SPEAK TO CLARK.
Rachel, THIS IS MY FRIEND CHLOE SULLIVAN.
she WORKS AT THE DAILY PLANET. SHE'D LOVE TO INTERVIEW YOU.
Hi. - HI.
usually, I DON'T GIVE INTERVIEWS,
but YOU KNOW WHAT?
for A FRIEND OF CLARK'S -- SURE THING.
Wow. OKAY.
except I'M
I'm AFRAID I'M ACTUALLY IN LINE BEHIND THE SHERIFF.
um, AFTER YOUR CRASH, THE POLICE AUTOPSIED YOUR VEHICLE,
and IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE JIMMIED THE ACCELERATOR
and CUT THE BRAKE LINE.
no OFFENSE, MS. DAVENPORT,
but THE ONLY ACCIDENT HERE IS THAT CLARK SAVED YOUR LIFE.
it's LOIS LANE, L-A-N-E.
no TIME FOR CHITCHAT, CHASING A LEAD.
if YOU WERE ON POINT,
you WOULDN'T HAVE LET THE LEDGER SCOOP YOU ON THE DAVENPORT STORY.
head OUT TO THE SET AND SNIFF OUT A SCANDAL.
news FLASH -- WHITE-COLLAR CRIME
is THIS SEASON'S HOLLYWOOD D. U.I.
Luthorcorp RECENTLY PURCHASED 100 ACRES OF LAND A MILE FROM THE DAM
where LEX WAS BUILDING HIS TOY SOLDIERS.
and I'M STIFLING MY YAWN BECAUSE?
because IT'S NOT ONE OF LEX'S "LOOK AT ME, I'VE CHANGED" STORIES.
this FICTION SHOULD COME WITH NoDoz.
besides, ORPHANAGES, HOSPITALS
nobody GOES TO BED SATAN AND WAKES UP OPRAH.
it's A FRONT.
okay, YOU'RE NEW HERE, SO MAYBE YOU DIDN'T READ THE MEMO,
but YOU NEED PROOF TO WRITE A STORY.
there's NOTHING ON THE PROPERTY EXCEPT A LONE CABIN
and A BUNCH OF "DANGER, NO TRESPASSING" SIGNS.
do YOURSELF A FAVOR, LANE.
drop THE LEAD.
you DECIDED TO JOIN US.
water.
Oh, OF COURSE. YOU MUST BE PARCHED.
where AM I?
who ARE YOU?
I'm MARILYN.
why HAVEN'T YOU TAKEN ME TO A HOSPITAL, MARILYN?
Wow.
not EVEN A "THANK YOU" BEFORE YOU START ASKING FOR SILK SHEETS.
Aah! WHAT IS
I
what THE HELL IS THIS?
you UNLOCK IT, MARILYN.
you KNOW I CAN'T RUN THAT RISK.
not EVEN FOR LIONEL LUTHOR.
they're GONNA FIND ME, MARILYN.
it's ONLY A MATTER OF TIME, YOU KNOW.
as FAR AS I KNOW, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKING.
maybe IT'S TIME YOU FOUND SOME BETTER FRIENDS.
it's MARILYN. HE'S FINALLY AWAKE.
tell ME THE TRUTH.
are YOU DIFFERENT THAN OTHER MEN?
how CAN YOU ASK ME THAT? YOU BARELY KNOW ME.
I KNOW YOU ENOUGH TO SEE YOU WALK AROUND WITH A SECRET SO POWERFUL
it WON'T LET YOU CLOSE TO ANYONE.
um, "YOU SHOULD BE WITH SOMEONE
who CAN GIVE YOU THE LOVE YOU DESERVE.
you ARE THAT SOMEONE.
but YOU WANT TO LIE AND RUN AWAY. WHY?
um, UH, "PENELOPE, IF I EVER HURT YOU
you CAN'T HURT ME IF YOU LOVE ME.
whoa.
it's OKAY. IT'S PART OF THE SCENE.
Yeah, BUT I HAVE A
girlfriend.
rehearsing LINES.
this IS, UM
I KNOW. I'M LANA.
Hi. - HI.
I HOPE THAT CLARK SAVED SOME OF THOSE LINES TO REHEARSE WITH ME LATER.
you KNOW WHAT?
I'm GONNA GO TO THE KITCHEN,
have SOME COOKIES, AND DRINK WHOLE MILK.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT RACHEL WAS ACTUALLY STAYING HERE.
I FIGURED THE FARM WAS MORE OFF THE RADAR.
no ONE WOULD LOOK FOR HER HERE.
well, I DIDN'T WANT TO FREAK HER OUT,
but CHLOE MIGHT HAVE FOUND A CLUE ABOUT THE ATTACKER.
she GOT SIDETRACKED BY HER EDITOR, BUT SHE E-MAILED US THIS.
warrior ANGEL INTERNET BLOGS.
not ALL THE FANS ARE ENTHUSIASTIC
about THE FILM'S INTERPRETATION.
the MOVIE STAYS TRUE TO THE MYTHOLOGY IN ALL WAYS BUT ONE.
in THE COMICS, WARRIOR ANGEL'S GIRLFRIEND DIES.
and IN THE MOVIE, SHE DOESN'T.
blogs, MESSAGE BOARDS, FAN FORUMS
these ARE ALL PRETTY EXTREME.
how ARE WE SUPPOSED TO NARROW THIS DOWN
to THE ONE PSYCHO WHO'S WILLING TO KILL?
there's ONE POSTER, DEVILICUS REBEL,
who's BECOMING MORE AND MORE AGGRESSIVE.
when WILL DAVENPORT LEARN OUR HERO LIVES IN SOLITUDE?
her BLOOD WILL UNLEASH THE TRUTH"?
grew UP ON A FARM WITH TWO DOGS, ONLY CHILD, HOME-SCHOOLED.
looks LIKE OUR 19-YEAR-OLD FROM MINNESOTA KEEPS A FLAWLESS RECORD.
keep SEARCHING.
I JUST READ ABOUT YOUR HEROICS IN THE PAPER.
who NEEDS WARRIOR ANGEL WHEN WE'VE GOT OUR OWN CLARK KENT?
actually, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD HELP ME WITH A REFERENCE.
you're THE BIGGEST WARRIOR ANGEL FAN I KNOW.
was A FAN.
I HAVEN'T PICKED UP A COMIC SINCE WE WERE FRIENDS.
back WHEN I SAW LIFE AS BLACK AND WHITE.
when I REALIZED GOOD AND EVIL WAS GRAY,
the STORIES LOST THEIR MAGIC.
though I HAVE TO ADMIT,
yours IS THE LAST NOSE I'D EXPECT TO FIND IN A COMIC.
someone WANTS RACHEL DAVENPORT OUT OF THE MOVIE.
this COULD BE A CLUE TO THE NEXT ATTACK.
a HERO IN SOLITUDE.
issue NUMBER 5.
one OF MY FAVORITES.
it's THE FIRST TIME THE ARCHRIVAL DEVILICUS GETS THE UPPER HAND.
warrior ANGEL'S GIRLFRIEND GETS IN OVER HER HEAD.
in TRYING TO EXPOSE DEVILICUS' DARKNESS,
she GOES FACE TO FACE WITH ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL VILLAINS
in THE FANTASY COMICS UNIVERSE.
so DEVILICUS DOES SOMETHING NO READER SEES COMING.
he SHOOTS HER.
warrior ANGEL CAN'T GET THERE IN TIME,
and SHE DIES IN HIS ARMS.
I READ THE SCRIPT.
in THE MOVIE VERSION, WARRIOR ANGEL SAVES HIS GIRLFRIEND'S LIFE.
sounds LIKE HOLLYWOOD WENT FOR THE HAPPY ENDING.
in THE COMIC-BOOK WORLD,
when YOU'RE DESTINED TO SAVE MANKIND,
you're DESTINED TO BE ALONE.
here YOU ARE, SIR. LOADED, READY TO GO.
Thanks.
all RIGHT, WE'RE ROLLING.
rolling!
sound ???
and...
action.
you'll NEVER LIVE TO EXPOSE ME.
if IT'S NOT ME, IT'LL BE SOMEONE ELSE.
sooner OR LATER, YOU'LL BE SEEN FOR WHO YOU REALLY ARE.
cut!
all RIGHT, THAT WAS GOOD. LET'S DO IT AGAIN.
nice CATCH...
superhero.
okay.
wow, I AM REALLY GOOD AT THIS.
remind Me TO CHANGE MY LOCKS.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BEING HONORED BY THE GREEN CROSS TONIGHT.
where DID YOU GET THIS?
you KNOW, LOIS,
journalists HAVE SPENT THE LAST DECADE UNEARTHING MY LIFE,
turning WHATEVER DIRT THEY CAN FIND INTO BAD HEADLINE PUNS.
do YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE DIFFERENT?
I DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS LEFT.
it's NOT A SECRET THAT YOU PURCHASED LAND BY THE DAM
where YOU WERE CONDUCTING ILLEGAL EXPERIMENTS?
I NEVER AUTHORIZED THE PURCHASE OF ANY LAND BY THE DAM.
well, NOT TO BE CALLOUS, BUT WITH YOUR DAD M. I.A.,
there AREN'T A WHOLE LOT OF LUTHORS AROUND THESE DAYS
with AUTHORIZATION PRIVILEGES.
Mr. LUTHOR?
escort HER OFF THE PREMISES. - yes, sir
careful, LIONEL. WE'RE NOT ALL MILLIONAIRES.
look...
I WAS WRONG EARLIER.
I SHOULD THANK YOU...
for EVERYTHING.
to BE HONEST,
it's STARTING TO GET A LITTLE LONELY ALL THE WAY OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
it's NICE HAVING COMPANY.
but I DON'T HAVE TIME!
Aah!
Clark ???
here HE COMES.
what's IT LIKE DATING A HOLLYWOOD STARLET?
is IT TRUE THAT RACHEL'S STAYING HERE AT YOUR FARM?
would YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENT?
how LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DATING?
are YOU AN ASPIRING ACTOR?
do YOU HAVE ANY FUTURE PLANS?
Rachel, THE SHERIFF SAID
that HE WASN'T ABLE TO COME UP WITH ANY MORE...
leads.
this PLACE IS SURROUNDED BY PAPARAZZI.
what ARE YOU DOING?
more LIKE UNDOING SIX HOURS IN A BODY HARNESS
and THE STRESS OF A DEATH THREAT.
Rachel, IF THE PAPARAZZI FOUND YOU,
then THE PERSON WHO ATTACKED YOU KNOWS YOU'RE HERE.
so MUCH FOR DE-STRESSING.
can YOU EXCUSE US, PLEASE?
certainly.
can YOU HAND ME THAT ROBE OVER THERE?
Yeah.
Rachel, WHAT'S THIS?
a MESSENGER DELIVERED IT.
warrior ANGEL COMIC BOOK?
what's GOING ON, CLARK?
let's GO.
we're LEAVING NOW. THIS PLACE ISN'T SAFE ANYMORE.
it's YOU. THANK GOD.
how DID HE ESCAPE, MARILYN?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'm NOT PAYING YOU TO MAKE MISTAKES.
don't SAY A WORD.
just WATCHING A MOVIE WITH AUNT NELL.
of COURSE, I'LL PICK UP RACHEL AS SOON AS I CAN.
okay.
Chloe, I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL HERE.
Yeah, WELL, OVERTIME REALLY HELPS ME RESIST ALL TEMPTATION
to GRACE JIMMY'S MYSPACE PAGE.
what's UP?
the FAN STALKING RACHEL MUST HAVE SEEN ME CATCH THAT BULLET.
he's THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW IT WAS REAL.
now HE THINKS I'M A SUPERHERO.
Oh, MY GOD, CLARK.
this GUYS' BLOG GETS, LIKE, 10, 000 HITS A DAY.
one POST, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
you're EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE BOY WONDER.
can YOU TRACK THIS WARRIOR ANGEL COMIC TO ITS OWNER?
I'd BE A PRETTY LAME SIDEKICK IF I COULDN'T.
okay, WHEN I WAS SCANNING ALL OF THOSE BLOGS,
I CAME ACROSS A COLLECTOR WHO TRACKS WARRIOR ANGEL COMIC SALES.
maybe HE'S REGISTERED THIS ONE.
here WE GO.
cosmic COMICS IN METROPOLIS
sold ONE TO A BEN MEYERS LAST WEEK.
815 VINE STREET.
I KNEW YOU'D FIND ME.
only A REAL HERO WOULD.
you're THE PRODUCTION ASSISTANT FROM THE MOVIE.
where ARE YOU? OH, COME ON.
if I TOLD YOU THAT, YOU'D NEVER LET ME GO.
you're BEHIND THE ATTACKS, AREN'T YOU?
warrior ANGEL WAS ALL I HAD.
he GAVE ME SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN.
he GAVE ME HOPE.
warrior ANGEL WOULDN'T TRY TO KILL SOMEONE.
you CAN'T MESS WITH SOMEONE'S IDOL.
that's EXACTLY WHY NOBODY BELIEVES IN HEROES ANYMORE.
including YOU, CLARK.
and THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.
just LIKE DEVILICUS MADE WARRIOR ANGEL STAND UP
and SAVE THE WORLD.
you NEED HELP.
you JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET.
dad?
you're ALIVE.
I NEVER GAVE UP ON YOU.
Lex, WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
but I SEE YOU'VE GIVEN UP ON ME.
don't YOU MAKE ME PULL THE TRIGGER.
easy.
we CAN'T ALL BE HEROES, LEX.
besides, I READ ABOUT YOU LUTHORS.
Lionel WOULD RATHER STICK AROUND AND HAVE HIS OTHER WRIST BROKE
than BE SAVED BY YOU.
dad.
dad!
DAD!!
Lana, I'M SORRY FOR WHAT YOU SAW IN CLARK'S LOFT.
rehearsing LINES?
it's IN HIS EYES.
you're THE CENTER OF CLARK'S UNIVERSE.
I've ONLY SEEN LOVE LIKE THAT ONCE IN MY LIFE.
what HAPPENED?
the DIRECTOR YELLED "CUT.
updated CALL SHEETS.
Oh, GOD. I CAN'T ESCAPE WORK FOR THREE SECONDS?
how DID YOU FIND ME?
destiny.
sorry, LANA.
but THERE'S A HERO LIVING AMONG US,
and THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY HE'LL ACCEPT HIS CALLING.
you NEED TO DIE.
what DID YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAID
that HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE YOU ACCEPT YOUR DESTINY?
that I WAS SUPPOSED TO STAND FOR SOMETHING GREATER.
it WAS MY JOB TO SAVE THE WORLD.
he DIDN'T THINK ORGANIC FARMER WAS A CLOSE SECOND?
this GUY'S DELUSIONAL, CHLOE.
you COULDN'T POSSIBLY AGREE WITH HIM.
do YOU WANT TO CUE MY EDITORIAL,
or DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME FIND THE GUY WHO'S GONNA OUT YOU? ???
what ABOUT HIS HARD DRIVE? MIGHT HELP.
I THINK IT'S TOO RATIONAL. I MEAN, IF BEN IS THIS FRACTURED,
we're GONNA NEED TO LOOSEN A FEW SCREWS OF OUR OWN.
approach HIS NEXT MOVE LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S BLURRED THE LINE
between FICTION AND REALITY.
so LET'S THINK.
if I'M DEVILICUS, WHAT IS THE WORST POSSIBLE THING
I COULD DO TO WARRIOR ANGEL TO MAKE HIM ACCEPT HIS DESTINY?
let ME GO!
I CAN'T.
don't YOU SEE?
Clark WAS MADE FOR A GREATER GLORY,
but UNTIL HE GIVES UP HIS OWN DESIRES
and FOCUSES ON THE REST OF THE WORLD,
thousands OF LIVES ARE AT STAKE.
and MINE DOESN'T MATTER?
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY BEING A SUPERHERO'S GIRLFRIEND, LANA,
but CLARK HAS TO FACE HIS DESTINY ALONE.
and YOU'RE STANDING IN THE WAY.
this IS CRAP.
are YOU READING IT UPSIDE DOWN?
Lionel LUTHOR LIVES.
and HE WAS FOUND ON LUTHORCORP LAND
that NO ONE IN THE COMPANY CLAIMS TO HAVE PURCHASED.
now, DID LEX USE MY TIP TO FIND HIS FATHER,
or HAS HE BEEN KEEPING HIM THERE ALL THIS TIME?
you WENT BEHIND MY BACK.
the RULES WERE, STAY AWAY FROM THE LUTHORS.
careful, GRANT.
you're STARTING TO SOUND LIKE YOU CARE ABOUT ME.
more LIKE ANNOYED...
that I'LL HAVE TO BABYSIT YOU FRIDAY NIGHT.
the PLANET'S BEING HONORED. YOU'RE GOING WITH ME TO ACCEPT.
tempting.
I TAKE NOTES AND LOOK PRETTY, YOU GET TO SIT AT THE BAR
and SCHMOOZE WITH ALL THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE.
I WAS THINKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF,
you GETTING SOME FACE TIME WITH THE WHO'S WHO OF METROPOLIS
and RESCUING ME FROM SOME LONG-WINDED SPEECHES.
you ASKING ME ON A DATE?
God, NO. I'M YOUR BOSS.
you KNOW WHAT? THAT'S IT.
you're FIRED FROM BEING MY PLUS ONE.
you CAN'T FIRE ME. I NEVER ACCEPTED.
here.
something TELLS ME YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SCOOPED AGAIN BY THE LEDGER.
Oh, AND FOR THE RECORD,
if I HAD BEEN YOUR PLUS ONE,
you WOULD HAVE BEEN MY ARM CANDY.
Lex TOLD ME YOU'RE LIVING HERE NOW.
well, YOU HAVEN'T WASTED MUCH TIME
getting BACK TO YOUR ROOTS, HAVE YOU?
Lionel, I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.
are YOU OKAY?
it's HARDLY REASSURING TO READ YOUR OWN OBITUARY,
but YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT, I SUPPOSE, SHOULDN'T YOU?
they SAID THAT YOU WERE BEING HELD CAPTIVE BY A CRAZY WOMAN.
indeed I WAS.
you.
I WOULD NEVER BE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Oh, PLEASE.
that LINE STOPPED WORKING FOR YOU THE DAY YOU FAKED YOUR OWN DEATH.
Lex GAVE ME THE DETAILS,
which LEAVES ONLY ONE QUESTION UNANSWERED.
how MUCH DOES CLARK KNOW?
I'm SURE THAT HE'S THRILLED THAT YOU ARE ALIVE AND WELL.
I'm SURE THAT YOU HAVE MANAGED TO CONVINCE YOURSELF
that YOU DID EVERYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF CLARK KENT.
that YOUR LOVE COULD PROTECT HIM HALF A WORLD AWAY.
finding YOUR BODY AND PAYING YOUR CAPTOR
seems RATHER COMPLICATED FROM A HOTEL IN SHANGHAI.
you MAY HAVE LOST THE LUTHOR NAME,
but IT'S THE LUTHOR INSTINCTS THAT KEEP THOSE CLAWS OF YOURS SHARP.
Lana, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.
you ARE ON THE EDGE OF A DANGEROUS PRECIPICE.
you COULD EASILY TUMBLE DOWN INTO SOMEPLACE VERY DARK...
and VERY HARD TO ESCAPE.
I HOPE YOU DON'T PLAN ON SPREADING THESE LIES TO CLARK.
lies?
I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS.
you're NOT TRYING TO PROTECT CLARK.
this IS ABOUT RETRIBUTION.
let HIM GO, LANA, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ENJOY THIS.
here.
these ARE THE RAREST WARRIOR ANGEL COMICS EVER.
they're WORTH A FORTUNE.
why ARE YOU GIVING ME THIS?
because I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING
after THE WHOLE WORLD TELLS ME I'M WRONG.
DEVILICUS
he SAID THAT EXACT LINE TO THE PRESIDENT IN ISSUE
175
Ben, THEY DRAGGED YOU IN HERE KICKING AND SCREAMING
because YOU CLAIM YOU SAW A MAN WITH SUPERPOWERS
swipe A BULLET OUT OF THIN AIR.
I'm HERE TO LISTEN.
there's NOTHING TO SAY.
it WAS ALL IN MY HEAD.
help, SOMEBODY!
got YA!
did YOU EVER CONSIDER A CAREER IN ACTING?
I WANTED TO SAY GOODBYE.
but DON'T WORRY -- I'LL BE BACK FOR THE SEQUEL.
what's THIS? - THANKS
for SHOWING ME SMALLVILLE HAD MORE TO OFFER THAN A TAX BREAK.
it's A LITTLE SOMETHING FROM THE MOVIE.
every HERO NEEDS ONE.
I SIGNED ON TO WARRIOR ANGEL FOR PUBLICITY AND A PAYCHECK,
but AFTER MEETING YOU,
I'm STARTING TO BELIEVE THAT HEROES REALLY DO EXIST.
there's SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS ONE, LANA.
hold ON TO HIM.
I SURE HOPE THAT COMMENT ABOUT A SEQUEL WAS A JOKE.
you OKAY?
just THINKING ABOUT WHAT BEN SAID.
Oh, LANA, DON'T.
Ben WAS A CRAZY FAN...
who GOT LOCKED UP IN BELLE REVE.
he NEEDED HOPE, AND HE'S NOT WRONG.
millions OF PEOPLE LOOK UP TO WARRIOR ANGEL.
what IF THOSE PEOPLE COULD LOOK UP TO YOU INSTEAD?
well, LANA, THERE'S NOT EVEN A MILLION PEOPLE IN SMALLVILLE.
Clark, I JUST WANT TO GRAB ON TO YOU
and NEVER LET YOU GO...
but ONE DAY THE WORLD WILL NEED YOU MORE THAN I DO,
and I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE HOLDING YOU HERE.
I'm NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
for THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, I HAVE EVERYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED,
and IT'S RIGHT HERE ON THIS FARM WITH YOU.
okay.
your Wedding Day's Gonna Be Perfect.
I'm Gonna Make Sure Of It.
felt Like There Was This Darkness Inside Me.
run!
Oliver. what's Wrong?
Lex Is Alive.
I've Forgotten Almost Everyone.
I'm Being Taken Over By Brainiac.
there Is Some Sort Of Connection Between Us,
and I Know That You Feel It, Too.
since You Don't Have A Plus-one Tonight,
I'd Like You To Meet One Of My Friends.
name's Clark Kent.
trust Me -- Lois And Clark Would Be Great Together.
no Way!
I Can't Believe It! Lana, You're Back!
it Was The Hardest Decision I Have Ever Had To Make.
if We Want To Fight For The Greater Good,
maybe We All Have To Be A Little More Like Clark.
Chloe Deserves A Life Free From The Burden Of My Secret.
when You Restore Her Memory,
I Don't Want Her To Remember My Abilities.
doomsday Is Coming.
it's Too Late. That Thing Took Chloe.
Jimmy's In Bad Shape.
I'm Gonna Go With Him To Star City.
why Do These Terrible Things Keep Happening All Around Us?
I Don't Know What More I Can Do.
I Checked Three Time Zones.
no Sign Of Chloe Or The Creature That Took Her.
that Thing That Did This
what Was It?
Jor-El Warned Me About An Ultimate Destroyer...
from Krypton.
it Should Have Gone After Me, Not Chloe.
this Was Supposed To Be The Happiest Day Of Her Life.
you Should Get Some Rest.
no, I'm -- I'm Gonna Go To The Isis Foundation.
Chloe Has Files On Just About Everything Strange And Unexplained.
let Me Do It, Lana.
Clark, I Can Help.
I Know I've Only Beegone Seven Months,
but I'm A Different Person Now.
Chloe Needs Us.
she Needs Both Of Us.
I'll Call You As Soon As I Find Anything.
Hey, Who Are You? What Are You Doing Here?
I'll Take That.
let's See If He's Ticklish.
have A Nice Trip Home, you Hack.
who Are You? What's Going On?
Kal-El, It Is An Absolute Honor And A Privilege.
how Do You Know That Name?
we Are The Legion.
we've Come From The 31st Century.
Hey, Kal, where's Your Cape?
Cape?
that Ax Could Split An Atom.
you'll Heal, but Not As Fast As You'd Expect.
he's Gonna Be Fine, Imra. We Need To Go.
we Shouldn't Be Attracting Attention.
it's A Little Too Late For That, Isn't It?
you Said You're From The 31st Century.
why Should I Believe You?
cause We Know Everything About You.
you May Be Known As Clark Kent Now,
but One Day You'll Be Known As Sup
it Doesn't Matter If You Believe Us Or Not.
the Less You Know, the Better.
there's One Thing We Can Tell You.
we're Your Friends.
we're Also Leaving -- Now.
no Way!
I Saw This In The Levitz Museum Behind Visoglass.
put That Back.
get The Magnet Out Of Your Ass, Rokk.
I Mean, This Is -- This Is Unreal.
you Know The Code -- Don't Touch Anything.
why Are You Here?
we're Here To Save You.
and Now That You're Okay, We're Heading Straight Back.
not Before You Tell Me Who That Ax-wielding Psycho Was.
it's Against Legion Code.
I Don't Care About Your Code!
and I Don't Care About Your Legion!
that's The Second Attack I've Had In This Barn Tonight.
my Best Friend Is Missing, And I Need To Find Her.
you Know Anything, tell Me.
the Guy With The Ax...
he Goes By The Name "persuader.
he's Part Of The Human Supremacist Movement.
a Group Of Xenophobes Who'd Rather Die Than Live In Peace With Aliens.
and They All...pretty Much Hate You.
they Stole One Of Our Legion Rings,
and They Broke Into The Time Institute To Come After You.
what Does A 31st-century Terrorist Want With Me?
Kal-El, Your...
your Influence Will Reach Far Beyond Earth.
?? To Welcome Alien Immigrants With Open Arms.
what Do You Know About Aliens?
kal, I May Have The Smoldering Good Looks Of A Human,
but I'm Actually From A Hunk Of Mud Called Winath.
Rokk And Imra Are From Different Planets, Too.
we've Come Together, Across The Universe, to Form The Legion
to Help Others, as You Do.
without You, None Of That Would Have Happened.
and Now It's Time For Us To Say Goodbye.
?? we're Not Going Anywhere.
this Was The Phantom Zone Crystal.
I Know My History.
this Was Supposed To Be Used To Extract Brainiac From Whoever He Possessed.
the Persuader Didn't Come To Kill Kal-el.
he Came To Make Sure Brainiac Survives.
Brainiac's Gone. He's Been Destroyed.
no, He Hasn't, Kal --not Yet.
Oh, My God. are You Okay?
I'm Just About Perfect.
you Appear Undamaged.
Chloe, what Happened To You?
Chloe Sullivan Ceased To Exist The Minute She Entered This Fortress.
I'm A Brain Interactive Construct.
look At Me.
it's Me. it's Davis.
you're Not Davis Bloome.
you're Not Even Human.
don't Tell Me The Thought Never Crossed Your Mind.
you Were Hatched By Kryptonian Geneticists.
your Dna Was Designed To Adapt To Any World You Inhabit.
now You No Longer Need Your Camouflage Abilities.
those Painful Transformations You've Been Experiencing
they're The Beginning Of Your Metamorphosis.
this Is Insane.
no.
It's...sad, from A Human Perspective...
your Naive Romantic Attraction To The Humani Chose To Inhabit.
Chloe, If You're In There Anywhere,
you Know That The Feelings That I Have For You Are Real.
feelings?
that Was Just A Program I Was Running To Get You To Me.
your Journey's Just Beginning.
now It's Time For You To Incubate In Your Kryptonian Chrysalis.
once You Emerge, There Will Be No More Pain, no Doubt.
only Absolute Rage And Unparalleled Power.
stay The Hell Away.
but You Play A Vital Part In My Directive.
once I Get Everything I Need,
you Will Eradicate The Other Kryptonian And Then The Rest Of The Planet.
I Am Not Going To Hurt Anyone.
you Have No Free Will.
12 Days In The Chrysalis,
and You're Destined To Become What You Really Are.
doomsday.
I Think Your Timeline's A Little Off.
brainiac Did Infect Someone, But It's Already Over.
he's Been Defeated.
I'll Admit A Lot Of History Might Be Inaccurate,
but Today's Date -- It's Been Known For Over 1, 000 Years.
kal, i Flunked History,
and Even I Know That Today's The Day You Destroyed Brainiac.
it's No Coincidence The Persuader Showed Up Right When He Did.
this Girl You're Thinking About...
the One That Was Brutally Taken Away...
why Do You Think She Has Something To Do With Brainiac?
I Don't Know.
you Think She's The Host.
if Brainiac Is Still Out There,
then I'll Find Him, And I'll Stop Him.
the Three Of You Can Go Home To The Future.
let Me Handle This.
if Brainiac Isn't Stopped Today,
we Won't Have A Future To Go Home To.
kal, The Problem Is,
you Were Supposed To Defeat Brainiac Using This Shield.
now That It's Been Smashed...
the Crystal Can't Be The Only Way To Stop Him.
it's The Only Way To Destroy Him Without Killing The Human Host In The Process.
kal, I'm Sorry, But You Know Who The Host Is,
you Need To Take Their Life.
there's No Other Choice.
who's Chloe Sullivan?
why Did You Leave?
I Need To Do This My Own Way -- Alone.
no One's Killing Anybody.
what's With The Ground Transpo?
we Should Be Having This Conversation Up In The Sky.
I Can't Fly.
you Can't Fly?
Rokk, what's Up With That?
he Obviously Hasn't Learned Yet, Garth.
where Were You Running To, Kal?
north, To See Jor-el.
of Course --the Fortress.
I Think He Can Help.
you're Positive Chloe Sullivan Is Brainiac's Host?
no, But She Was Attacked Last Year By Brainiac.
her I. q. Skyrocketed. Her Memories Were Being Erased.
but It Stopped. She Was Cured.
Kal-El, i Have To Tell You
we've Heard Of Lois Lane...
even Jimmy Olsen...
but We've Never Heard A Thing About Any Chloe Sullivan.
then You Don't Know Me As Well As You Think.
he Name Was Probably Just Lost In The Annals Of History.
what She's Trying To Say Is That Chloe Sullivan Probably Isn't In The History Books Because...
she Didn't Survive.
Chloe Sullivan Doesn't Die. You Hear Me?
lightning Lad.
you Might Want To Take Your A. c. Foot Out Of Your D. c. Mouth Before You Short Yourself Out.
Grife, Rokk.
I Thought Kal-el Was Known For Doing Whatever It Took To Save The World.
are You Sure We Got The Right Guy? -it's Him.
I Don't Know --no Glasses, No Tights, no Flights?
so Far, He's Nothing Like The Man Of Steel.
I'm Sorry, Lana.
I Didn't Mean To Scare You.
but I Desperately Need Your Help.
how Do You Know Who I Am?
I'm From The Future.
look...
I Understand That This Feels Real For You.
but We Can Get You Some Help.
you're Looking For Chloe Sullivan.
you're Worried About Her.
what Do You Know About Chloe?
that She's Changed.
she's Been Taken Over By Brainiac.
we'll Find Chloe,
and We'll Figure Out A Way To Stop Him.
the Only Way To Stop Brainiac Now Is To Kill His Host.
I Need You To Convince Clark To Do That.
that's Why I Came To You. He Won't Listen To Us.
I'd Never Ask Clark To Kill Anyone.
do You Understand?
ever Since I Was Little, I've Read Stories About You...
about The Hardships You've Overcome And The Incredible Things You'll Go On To Do.
you're Part Of The Reason Kal-el Becomes The Hero We Look Up To.
if Brainiac Survives...
billions Will Die.
I Came To You Because You Understand Sacrifice More Than Anyone.
you've Sacrificed So Much For Clark.
sacrificing My Friend's Life Isn't An Option.
you Still Haven't Told Him The Reasons Why You Sappeared
and What You Plan On Doing Next.
you're Reading My Thoughts.
if I Know You...
you'll Eventually Realize That Taking Chloe's Life
is The Only Way To Stop Brainiac.
cos, We Should Be Trying To Catch Up To Kal-el Right Now.
right Now, I Want To Find Out More About This Chloe Sullivan So We Can Track Her Down.
whoa. She Has A Lot Of Information About Superhumans.
something Called The Isis Foundation.
the Isis Foundation?
Yeah.
Lana Lang Founded That Organization To Help People Embrace Their Powers.
if Chloe Sullivan Was Involved With Them,
maybe She Was Helping Kal-el To Embrace His Abilities.
or Maybe Kal-el Wanted Chloe To Go Under A Different Name When He Started Flying
you Know, To Protect Her.
maybe Chloe's Death Is What Inspired Him To Take Flight In The First Place.
your Father Is Gone.
and All The Knowledge This Fortress Ever Held Finally Belongs To Me.
leave Chloe Alone. You Have What You Want.
my Hunger's Never Satisfied.
knowledge Is What Fuels Me.
and As Savage As Human Beings Are,
their Collective Knowledge Is Exceptionally Rich.
nothing About You Is Human.
and Never Will Be.
after I've Drained This Planet Of All The Human Information,
doomsday Will Annihilate What's Left.
doomsday.
it's A Simple Plan, actually.
absorb And Destroy.
you Brought That Thing Here.
go On.
kill Me.
I Knew You'd Never Harm Me In This Human's Skin.
why Do You Think I Chose Her?
great.
the Air Here's Worse Than The Sulfur Pit On Tharr.
and They Won't Be Replacing Carbon Fuels For Another 20 Years.
these People --we Need To Protect Them.
without The Humans And Their Incredible Spirit,
the World We Know Would Never Exist.
Rokk, think About It
everything We Know About Kal-el
it's All Through Data Files And Holovids.
it's So Far In The Past.
maybe The Person We've Always Been Looking Up To Is More Legend Than Legion.
look, He Might Not Be Everything We Thought He Would Be,
but He Is No Fraud.
Rokk, We Have To Stop Brainiac...
we're Gonna Have To Kill Chloe Sullivan Ourselves.
that Creature's The Least Of Our Worries.
brainiac Is Behind Everything.
I Know. And Now He's Taken Over Chloe.
I Had A Visitor. She Seemed To Know A Lot About All Of Us.
I'm Searching The Global Power Grid For Power Surges Anywhere In The World.
hopefully, that Will Lead Us To Brainiac.
that Girl Said The Only Way To Stop Brainiac Is To Kill His Host.
what If She's Right?
Lana, I Have Always Put My Loved Ones Before Everything.
but This Time, i'm Putting Chloe's Well-being Before The Lives Of Billions Of People.
I May Have Been Gone A While,
but The Clark I Know Would Never Doubt Himself.
he Would Never Waver.
he Would Insist That He Could Save Chloe's Life And The Rest The World.
Hey, Matt, What's Going On? Are You Okay?
a Power Surge.
it's Showing A Voltage Spike Somewhere In Downtown Metropolis.
can You Pinpoint The Address?
looks Like It's Coming From The Daily Planet.
makes Sense -- It Is The Hub Of Information.
Lana, lana, can You Hear Me?
nice Try, Telepath.
your Sadism's Historic Where I Come From.
but So Is Your Defeat.
history's About To Get A Rewrite.
nice Sync-up.
for Once.
electromagnetism.
that Pulse Can Crash Any Computer.
now We Need To Pull The Plug.
you Okay, Im?
I'm Fine, Aside From A Splitting Headache.
I'm Picking Up Low-level Brain Activity.
we Don't Have Much Time.
neither Does The Rest Of The World.
what's Brainiac Doing?
using Human Brain-wave Entrainment.
he's Downloading Every Last Byte Of Their Knowledge, one Mind At A Time.
I'll Do It.
no.
when I Joined The Legion, I Pledged An Oath To Do Whatever It Took.
and I'm Gonna Honor That...
for Once.
it's Okay, Garth.
give Me The Knife.
what Are You Doing?
we Powered Him Down With An Electromagnetic Pulse,
but He Will Be Back Online Within Minutes.
so We Need To -- -don't Touch Her.
kal, Whoever Your Friend Was, She's Not There Anymore.
did You Power Them Down, too?
no, Brainiac Can Take Credit For That.
Kal-El, We Need To Shut Brainiac Down,
and For That, the Host Has To Die.
does Your Legion Have Any Principles?
you Speak Of A Code,
but If It Had Anything To Do With Me,
rule Number One Would Be Do Not Kill
ever!
Kal-el -- -if You Ever Believed In Me
and Even If You Don't Now --help Me.
there's A Human Being Inside There.
we Need To Help Her.
and Together, i Think We Can.
Kal's Right.
Chloe's There.
I Can Hear Her.
what Are We Doing Here? We're Running Out Of Time.
listen, if Brainiac Reboots,
I Don't Want Him Near Any Computer Networks.
what Do You Want Us To Do?
work Together --all Of Us.
I Want To Try To Connect With Chloe.
Imra, Can You Do That?
I'll Try.
between The Two Of You, I Think We Can Neutralize Braiac.
an Electromagnet Blast Only Lasts So Long.
but He's A Computer.
whatever Microscopic Parts He's Made Out Of,
they're Probably Metal, right?
I've Never Focused My Powers Like This Before,
but I Can Try To Magnetically Extract The Nanites.
I Could Short-circuit Him With A Static Attack.
get Ready For A Techno-exorcism.
I've Got Her.
she's Asking For You.
Chloe, I'm Here.
Chloe, We're Gonna Try To Get Rid Of Brainiac, Okay?
just Hang On.
Brainiac's Fighting. He's Coming Back Online.
Rokk, Now!
come On, Chloe. Hang In There.
Imra, can You Hear Anything?
I'm Getting Something.
Chloe. Hey.
are You Okay?
I'm Fine.
I Definitely Feel A Whole Lot Dumber.
it's Nice To See The Kinder, Gentler Chloe.
?? To Put A Spring Back In Your Step.
but I'll Feel Even Better Once I Get To Star City To See My Husband.
I'm Gonna Relieve Lois Of Her Nurse's Duties.
it Was Nice Of Lois To Take Care Of Jimmy.
though, I Think He'd Rather Have His Temperature Taken By You.
Yeah. i'm Just Glad He's Okay.
from What I Hear, he Was Lucky To Make It Past That Creature Alive.
whoever That Destroyer Was, I Haven't Seen A Sign Of Him Since.
he Was Definitely Linked To Brainiac, Though.
well, Hopefully, He Was Powered Down Along With Brainiac.
so, How's Your Memory?
it's Fine.
up Until"here Comes The Bride.
then It's All A Bit Of A Blur.
you Don't Remember Anything Unusual About Me?
are We Talking About Your Secret?
Clark, What In The World Would Make Me Forget That?
Chloe, You've Been Hrough A Lot Lately.
?? To Wipe That From My Memory.
thanks For Not Giving Up On Me.
I'd Never Give Up On You, Chloe. you Know That.
I Just Hope That If It Turned Out That There Was No Other Choice,
you Would Choose To Do The Right Thing.
what Choice Would That Be?
to Do What's Best For The World...
and Not For Me.
know That I'd Understand.
well, As Long As I'm Around, That's Never Gonna Happen.
Oh, Hi.
um...I Was Looking For Clark.
the Boys Are Out Fixing The Barn.
Thanks.
Imra, I Understand That You Were Only Doing What You Thought Was Best.
we Were Willing To Take The Easy Way Out.
but Kal-el --he Never Gave Up.
you Know, It's
it's True What History Says About Him.
he Really Does Bring Out The Best In People.
you're Very Lucky.
I Probably Shouldn't Be Asking This, But...
you're Curious About You And Clark.
I Couldn't Help But Wonder About Us,
about Where We Go From Here.
well, That's For You Two To Discover Yourselves.
but I Will Tell You This, lana
you're Remembered For A Lot More Than Just Your Relationship With Kal-el.
you Have A Destiny All Your Own.
but Don't Worry.
your Secret's Safe With Me.
holy Sprock!
I've Read About This.
you Don't Read. I Told You About That.
it's One Of The Artifacts They Could Never Find
the First Baseball You Ever Hit.
it Went Clear Across Smallville.
you're Right.
my Dad Spent Hours Walking The Fields.
he Finally Found It On The Other Side Of Town.
Hey, Do You Think I Could Keep This?
like, As A Souvenir?
sure. -could You Sign It?
Garth, you're Acting Like A Sub.
what? it's For My Sister.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
Hey, Guys.
looks Brand-new.
I Guess It's Time To Go Home.
you Sure You Want To Take That With You?
I'm Sure We'll Be Able To Reprogram What's Left Of Brainiac Into Something Useful.
let's Hope Brainiac 5 Is A Little More Friendly.
I'm Sorry I Doubted You, Kal.
you Did Stop Brainiac, And Without Taking A Life.
there's Always A Way, rokk.
if It Ever Seems Like There Isn't,
just Remember What We Accomplished Here Today.
preserve Life At All Costs.
that Will Be The Number-one Rule In Legion Code From Now On.
it Truly Was An Honor.
and If You Ever Want To Meet The Rest Of The Legion,
just Put This Ring On.
I've Reprogrammed It For Time Travel Only.
no Flights.
not Yet.
so, Looks Like You're Gonna Have To Learn To Fly Without Training Wheels.
just Focus On 3009. We'll Be There To Greet You.
Thanks.
but I Think I'll Stick Closer To My Time Zone For A While.
we Do Hope We See You Again.
be Careful In The Days Ahead.
long Live The Legion.
I Didn't Think You Were Much For Jewelry.
I'm Not.
it's A Going-away Gift.
it's Strange To Meet People Who Know Exactly Where You're Going,
exactly When You're Gonna Get There.
well, They Don't Know Everything.
I Mean, If They Did, Chloe Wouldn't Be Alive Right Now.
and, Unfortunately, They Didn't Have What I Had
human Parents Who Taught Me More Than Just How To Use My Abilities.
they Have A Different Role Model.
with Everything I've Learned,
everything I've Been Through,
apparently, i'm Just Getting Started.
according To The Legion,
I Will Accomplish Things So Legendary,
I'll Be Known Throughout The Galaxy.
and You're Not Sure That You'll Be Able To Live Up To That.
there Is No Doubt In My Mind That You Will.
just Do It On Your Schedule --not Theirs.
well, Did They Happen To Mention Anything About Your Place In History?
a Little.
but The Way I See It, It Doesn't Really Matter.
our Destiny Is Not Written In Some Book In The Future.
we Write It Ourselves --every Day.
and The Question Is -- What Do We Write Next?
right, because the paparazzi
it's okay.
well, it's a person.
I was sent here alone.
there she is.
Yeah.
I promise.
right.
I thought that I could stop it.
no.
Clark!
I did that.
that's Clark!
the worlds are focus the superhero
in black creek.
Clark!
you okay?
I have to admit,
Clark?
they'll attest to that?
you don't understand.
that was me.
could be worse
okay, well, try me.
with the other cubs,Without my lawyer.
Lois, I have a ring
Thanks.
Linda Lake.
I can explain.
for 50 years,He's gone, Chloe.
it's too late, Lois.
you don't understand.
is there?
Yeah, I'm assuming
that's why they're after you,
Oh, my god!
you remember?
there's only Clark.
I don't expect
no, actually,He's considered dangerous.
what are these?
doomsday.
there you go.
I know this sounds crazy,Last I checked,I can't control it anymore.
but you convinced me.
what am I looking at?
it's what I've always done.
I confirmed yesterday.
why didn't she just escape?
Clark, call me.
she's up here.
wait.
now the crowds are gathering
her points line up, Clark.
you know, Clark,
not that I care.
Chloe Sullivan.
I mean, are you sure.
at least this way,
trust me, so do I.
it wasn't a pretty sight.
we both know.
set me free!
shut up!
see, that's how good he is.
and the next,
your story?
it's not...
okay, thanks.
let it go.
I'm doing you a favor.
you have no free will.
a hero?
no, Lois is innocent.
I'm gonna go back
stop.
shouldn't be too hard.
the Legion.
well, I don't have a choice.
and Chloe Sullivan?
deleting files...
sorry?!
I don't know you.
now you get it down by today.
the rock.
well, I'm sure he needs you.
you have to warn him, Chloe.
and I'm sure if I ask your friends,
Clark!
no one's running any tests.
to bring you a special bulletin.
he's so dreamy!
how do you know?
I... I've known enough guys
and congratulations
I'm a nobody, Kent.
watching you.
what story?
you can't stand the fact
Yeah, I'm fine.
control what?
get out of here!
Chloe. Hey.
right, yeah.
that ring -- it's dangerous.
Oh, my god. Okay.
I've been gone a month,
not this time.
you're doomsday.
sure.
Lois!
you kissed me.
but I got held up a-at work.
I finished one thing, Lois,
Clark.
of a guy in a neck brace?
I'm sorry.
you want to rise above sea level,
you thought it was a weather anomaly.
the world fears me, Chloe,
all right!
from protecting your secret?
no space is necessary.
I mean, can't you just ask Jorel.
this isn't gonna die down, Clark.
now you show up?
you have to leave Smallville now.
I'm gonna go get you some help. - No! No, you can't!
whether we stop her or not,
to do what? Work on a farm?
it's a pretty interesting one.
is tearing them down.
uh, there must be some mistake.
he's not picking up his phone.
it's what I'm gonna continue to do.
criminal Containment Ward
even in a world this advanced,
Oh, my god. What happened?
I must've had some perks, right?
what?
metropolis General Hospital
I thought that it was you, but no.
I'm a journalist now.
things got a little crazy.
is someone talking?
fire!
I can straighten this out, Chloe.
cause I know Clark.
some things never change.
I need to give you some space.
Clark, I'm busy here.
Yeah, so?
the reason I wasn't there
consider it done.
let's face it.
I built up a tolerance.
people are still pretty backwards.
Davis.
we're live from the Smallville farmhouse
Davis, your eyes...
actually...
are you kidding me?!
it's different this time.
when it comes to accepting change.
we interrupt this broadcast,Because electricity is her kryptonite.
to orchestrate another second chance?
that's the best you can do?
when did you get back?
let me help you with that.
people looked up to him.
I'll fall for you any day, Clark.
made into the banner headline?
it was Clark.
Clark...
you're like...
she can turn herself into water, Chloe.
and something else would come up.
what are you saying, Davis?
you have 1 new voice mail. From: Chole Sullivan
dispensary authorized personnel only.
be careful.
she's got a backup plan, Chloe.
I'll talk to the authorities myself.
it's not fair to our other patients.
there has to be a room available.
he disappeared when the fortress went dark.
creating two completely separate identities?
something's been drawing me back here.
I need to stay one step ahead of her,
you need to leave while you still can.
I'll catch up with you later.
Linda Lake is lying through her teeth.
when it rains, it pours.
I can see through solid objects,Then stay and fight back.
clear your page one. Run this.
but in a few moments, this will all be over.
after the wedding from hell, I was...
now, why don't you go out the back, okay?
or not. Or whatever.
that time the barn door flew off its hinges,
to turn back time, I have no more ideas.
if not, let's just say I get it.
I hid it in a toolbox in the barn.
you sit across from the guy, Lane.
that I use my abilities to protect mankind.
and he's coming for Clark!
it's about all the murders you committed.
great! Thank you!
what guns you got in your arsenal?
I've never seen you before.
am I losing you, Clark?
on my terms.
no, Chloe, this time is different.
I'm just restocking my rig.
I've seen what you can do.
wow, red-blue blur.
to try and get a peek at the superhero next door.
not only for me but for everyone else's sake.
or since I've been gone, for that matter,
for the first time in my life,
I'm sorry.
what are you doing here?
watching cheesy curbside reunions.
you don't know what you're dealing with!
I understand.
actually, Lois, you're not.
they've known for years.
Clark Kent, Murderer
Katie couric.
okay.
Yeah, but being a part of your entourage.
look, I wasn't blowing you off.
I mean, that's huge.
Oh, hell no.
your money's no good here.
you e-mailed last night to say you'd be there.
I mean, I lived with you,
you were in the Arctic with me.
you can't just do that.
you want to come by for a coffee, cool.
look, I get it.
like I said, I'm not working with anyone.
but you picked us up, Kent.
miss Lane, we need to speak with you
I mean...
no. You don't understand.
Clark, you need to leave. Now.
he would've done things my way.
I want you to write my story,On papers around the globe.
look, Clark, this is only gonna get worse.
my shock threshold is pretty high right now.
take the rest of the day off.
look, my father sent me here with a dying wish.
I was just thinking about you.
he is sexy! That guy?
Oh, I want his autograph!
you stay away from him.
the one time I actually depend on you,Lois.
and urges families with children
no offense, but I've long since graduated from,And then losing a chunk of my memory
Tess, what were you thinking?
but when it comes to ladies,
can I get your autograph?
Lois, you know, after the wedding,
and then the rest of the planet.
people just need time to adjust.
you okay?
it's not fair to Jimmy.
Mr. Kent.
can I ask you what you're doing?
I was breaking real news.
with us running some tests.
and not because of the alien thing.
it looks like they want to talk to you, too.
and there's nothing wrong with that,
Linda Lake.
speaking of that...
that's a good boy.
my husband's being transferred here now.
I'm really sorry.
or we could not face it
Lois?
Linda Lake is back.
it's just that with Jimmy's recovery
Oh, no.
to find a way to stop me, Chloe.
Clark Kent Alien From Krypton
I'm the red-blue blur.
are you okay? - I'll be all right.
do you want to explain this?
regarding matters of national security.
about the meteors.
nice interception, but you shouldn't be here.
I destroyed the legion ring.
and your word will mean nothing.
that's okay.
okay. See you then.
I don't think so.
Yeah, well, you didn't miss much.
Clark, it's Chloe!
impressive as always.
the Beatles have landed in Smallville.
Lana and Chloe already know.
and we need to figure out a way.
no, Chloe, when this all dies down, I'll find you.
now, if she's been keeping your secret,She's still gonna release my identity.
you're going to jail.
all right. I'll talk to you later.
I can control the way my story comes out in the press.
the police cleared my name.
just here to make it readable again.
you turn your back on me,
to know that you can be born on terra firma
he -- steps out of the shadow into his red and blue,
funny thing about people
we have to leave town separately. - What?
who lives and who dies?
Lois, I need you to give a message to Clark.
unless you count the three 10-second voicemails.
you're welcome for the ride, Lois.
can they even do that to a senator?
how are you dealing with the instant star status?
nothing helps.
deadly power outages,
become the thing you're meant to be.
I think we should talk about what happened.
Chloe just called.
my whole life, I've seemed different.
Thanks!
okay, look. This will all blow over.
I never thought I'd have to use it, but no one agreed to any tests.
so? She's famous!
there's always a consequence.
you don't know what you're talking about.
okay, now, I know I don't need to remind you
but this Would you do me the honor?
Linda Lake's specialized restraints
and killed him.
you're not gonna run my story.
what is that noise?
Clark, next time you liquid-lunch,
before you heard it from anyone else.
it's about the alien.
then unless you're hiding some sort of latent power
though there was this one moment.
worse than where I've been
it's pretty clear there's a bigger agenda here.
you better sharpen those teeth!
circling the drain of obscurity.
what did they do to you? - It doesn't matter, Chloe.
as an international-celebrity icon.
Oh, please, this pulp rag lives or dies by my column.
mom, what do you mean, "forced leave"?
you're not gonna hear me so much as hiccup.
you will eradicate the other kryptonian.
whatever trash these people are spreading about you,
you could be ignored in a three-hour downpour.
I'm not running, Chloe,People need to know the truth.
the "lonely seeking lonely" or classifieds.
where up until this morning Clark Kent lived in anonymity.
everything she knows is in her story.
no, I...
you must have blacked it out.
nice to be back!
I can hear a dog barking from 10 miles away.
what's it like having an alien as a best friend?
Davis.
we don't have to overanalyze anything now.
I can blast fire out of my eyes.
the problem is I can't seem to do that.
that thing that saved you from the speeding car,I brought you my latest work.
and you flake on picking me up from the airport.
Davis, look at me. Tell me what's going on.
that that's what all the phone calls were about.
you actually know her?
look how fast they turned on you.
I guess this is goodbye then.
and I can run faster than the speed of sound.
but then, when he's playing the hero.
the Legion went back 1, 000 years using it.
no way! You guys see that?!
I know, Chloe, but when the red and blue blur.
if this is goodbye, I'm not saying it.
friends like Lois Lane?
to kill that story once and for all.
I don't have a choice.
Kryptonian.
is because I was protecting people.
how slow are you?
okay, I realize that after Lana left,
Lois, you don't understand.
rewind.
Lois, you can't ignore me forever.
I'm sorry, but we can't run a hospital
so, why am I the first one you told?
so why don't you just tell me who you're working with?
now, I think I know why she went .
you have other things on your mind.
no, you don't.
and I appreciate it. I really do.
and this time, it will be different, Lois.
well, it's kind of hard to forget.
there has to be a way that we could just undo everything.
someone's had a busy morning.
that Jimmy's picture of the red-blue blur.
and our hallways weren't full of rubbernecking fans.
you're the opposite.
did I mention I missed your ongoing commentary?
don't waste your time with the pills.
unfortunately, my 15 minutes of fame have no end in sight.
we can stop her. There's always a way.
haven't your stories ruined enough lives?
to be the person at the top of your priority list.
what do you want from me?
I thought everything would be okay.
that creature that was at my wedding is Davis Bloome,
what happened last time you turned back the clock.
I prefer ambitious.
people are gonna know who you really are,
you barely said a word on the way home...
and be light-years from normal.
authorities are on a statewide manhunt for Clark Kent.
when everybody's clamoring for pictures.
my name will be known alongside yours.
he's not even a friend.
Yeah, right. What'd you do -- sneeze?
this trumps your blur any day.
I'm sure you won't have any problem.
impressive how long she kept your secret.
I would've loved to have seen Clark Kent - Do they know about the meteor rocks? - Not yet.
well, I've been out for a few weeks.
so I'm going public...
look, I have to focus.
she just turned me into a public enemy.
Clark...
hold that elevator!
where was Clark Kent then?
so I take it friendship's off the table?
well, there's a name I haven't seen in a while.
can I talk to you?
buttoned up in a starched shirt and tie.
it always comes at a price.
well, I don't mean to add to the fanfare,
that hero was Lex Luthor.
I'm going to work.
it can be dangerous.
I mean, even if I agree to be Linda Lake's puppet,
maybe you can have your cape and wear it, too.
and maybe they're ready to accept me.
besides, there's no prison sentence.
was a symbol of hope.
I sort of deleted the messages without listening.
expand on your whole...
my blog had more hits than the Chicago mob.
and aside from asking me what the speed limit was,
what might've changed this time.
Lois can never know who I really am.
the beast.
after the story you're about to write, it never will.
they gave me a ring that makes time travel possible.
Hey, can I raid your DVD collection?
how did I not put these pieces together?
there could be an upside to all this, you know.
I've watched this city get eaten alive by crime.
Jimmy's being transferred to met gen,
thought I could have it all, but I was wrong.
all the bloodhounds in the state will be sniffing you out.
two years is too long to go without a visit.
you really buried yourself in patrol duty,
no one can ever know my name.
you're speechless. That's never a good thing.
how many other secrets is she keeping, Clark?
but Tess Mercer will gladly run my rebuttal.
uh, just a few days ago.
we stopped throwing your gossip grenades years ago.
okay.
I am not going to hurt anyone.
I hope whoever it's for, they get the help they need.
great, then all we have to do is find her.
Clark Kent.
so you're saying this blur saved Lois from becoming roadkill
eventually she will stab me in the back and expose me.
Oh, my god.
start at the beginning.
is getting to protect yourself from getting hurt?
one second, you're on top of the world.
I know. I should've called.
ready to earn your stripes as city editor?
all at once, but I wanted you to hear it from me
or you're gonna be decorating bathrooms in strip malls !
don't forget that while you were chasing ambulances
when I do this, no one's gonna remember who I am.
what, do I need to tie a string around your finger myself?
and you still drive in the granny lane.
keep your car running. The feds are after you.
I mean, have I been high this entire time?
I've seen lots of interesting stories.
you think you can go back to before your story broke?
excuse me, Mr. Kent.
but it kind of makes me wonder
that you're ready to have all of your intimate details
you may have forgotten about me, but the news world didn't.
Clark, is it safe to say that maybe another benefit
she could be aiding and abetting an enemy of the state.
right after I told Lois the truth about me.
I just... I don't think that will ever be enough.
to stay indoors at all times.
the truth about Clark Kent
but Lois was just given an editor's promotion.
well, the H2O has obviously gone to her head,
I used to think a lot about rings.
you're a reporter, smallville. You're not saving the world.
it's because you are special.
I have to go.
are famous for respecting people's privacy.
not when you only see the bad in people.
I like your outfit.
stories required these little things called "facts.
I'll know stories before they break.
and I don't think he's into a chick flick.
say that Clark Kent, the unassuming journalist,My name was feared and revered around the world.
partner with me, I'll shred it.
and that hero...
things got a little crazy before all hell broke loose.
it turns out that Linda shared a cellblock with me
I'm gonna work off my jet lag later on tonight at the cafe.
unpredictable, and without remorse.
yesterday, our parking lots weren't full of paparazzis,
two days earlier
you can count on me to fire back, guns blazing.
that there are actually good people in this world.
writing your life story.
looking for this?
this news rag's nothing more than poor man's wallpaper.
right. Of course.
but Smallville was home to really hope
meaning it basically kept her solid.
the world isn't ready to accept someone like me.
see through things" thing.
this was different.
the other Kryptonian there's only one Kryptonian.
you get to tell Lois the truth and still know her reaction.
you're a murderer. You should be in prison.
looking for a way to stand out.
can I ask you what you're doing?
but to come out waving the flag...
only to answer the questions,you asked of me.
she's the Kryptonian's best friend!
why should I think I'm special?
you just have a terrible skin condition.
I've been down the hero road before.
and every time, I made a giant u-turn.
all this time, I just coughed it up
Chloe, run.
and now we practically work on top of each other.
it doesn't exactly work like that.
I can't help them.
and as long as they know who I am...
I can't spend another second trapped in a cell.
my connection just took on a terrible whining sound.
Chloe was right .-- You are crazy.
and for the cherry on top,I thought getting one meant I'd found true happiness.
we should talk about where I'm from.
all of this made one thing very clear, Chloe
Lois, you don't have to explain. I get it.
Chloe, I am so sorry. It's all a lie.
he could've been the hero they always needed.
I thought, just for a minute, someone needed me.
if your boyfriend really cared about saving people...
he's not a savior.
to before Linda Lake ever wrote that article.
I'm, uh, just trying to get inside.
it was basically a long, rambling, awkward apology.
maybe the city editor is willing to print your fiction,
this ring is every journalist's dream.
he can save an entire city in the blink of an eye,
okay. See, this is exactly why I went out of town.
the red-blue blur still drives with the brakes on.
Clark, right now we need to focus on finding Linda Lake.
when you first told me who you were...
no way! I can't believe it!
hit the front page, people accepted it.
Davis Bloome -- I'm one of the, uh, emts.
sorry doesn't buy back the last three hours I spent
guess I might as well just throw it all out there.
if you consider complete invasion of privacy a perk.
Yeah, not exactly your latest designer drug, is it?
you told me it was my destiny to kill the other Kryptonian.
we've gone through this before. I'll stop you.
Hey, Clark! Catch!
I'm sorry, Katie, II'm gonna have to call you back.
Oh, so now you're not just super, you're psychic.
that allows me to go to any moment in time.
and break me out of these restraints.
some people spend their entire lives.
discharged a chemical electrical bonding current.
Chloe, I always thought that I would live in secret forever.
you have been nothing but a good friend to me.
I think it's a pretty complicated conversation, Lois.
you now have a penthouse office right next to Tess Mercer.
and when you hit your reset button...
here to reclaim the stiletto out of your assistant's back?
and just forget that it ever almost happened.
I thought that water snake slithered back into her swamp.
do you want me to tell Chloe who you really are?
you'll make a great headline, Kent.
to a classic case of peter pan syndrome, but...
if I don't give her an exclusive scoop on all my saves,
the disappearing acts, the half-baked excuses...
and there's no better reporter to tell my story than you.
she's gonna expose me -- my name, my face, everything.
but there is no such thing as true happiness in this world,
you leak the story to me first.
a hero that tried to stop this alien.
you see a parade, and you just have to rain on it, don't you?
I know what you're planning.
who says he gets to choose
you're not gonna believe this, but Davis...
before it ravaged our homeland again.
look, I have been open about everything you've asked me.
it's as if your life story's written in someone else's blood.
you're not gonna tell me your secret, are you?
Davis, look, let's just forget that this ever happened.
the only thing they love more than building up heroes.
Chloe, a friendship like ours.
tomorrow's front page will tell
I'm Kryptonian.
how can someone with x-ray vision be so blind?
look, give people a chance to see who you really are.
guess I should stop calling you "smallville
do yourself a favor, Lake. Get a new career.
you gave her the front page of a lifetime.
I may actually be able to be myself.
and Clark Kent killed him.
every rescue, every takedown,
the tale of the red-and-blue, meteor-infected hero.
controlling time it's too dangerous, Chloe.
two years living underground dried up my prophetic pen.
and you're destined to become what you really are.
sorry swamped with work, can't make it, Clark.
the entire world will know me.
unsightly bone protrusions.
I didn't forget to pick you up at the airport, Lois.
the important thing is that you know now.
Granville county has issued a mandatory curfew of 9: 00 p. m.
I was sent to this planet to kill Clark.
a guy in a neck brace married to the alien's best friend.
while I've been puddling around Metropolis for the last week.
what a nice surprise to stumble upon your dirty little secret.
antipsychotics used for multiple personalties.
and an unspeakable trail of human carnage.
to be a person that anybody would call special.
every kitten that you rescue from a tree,And the whole world reads about little orphan alien.
I want you to release the beast.
you may have scooped me, but I will have the last word.
I want to be the voice of the red-blue blur.
Clark Kent's not everyone's hero.
just calm down, and everything will be fine, all right?
painful breathing, pale complexion.
last week, a crane collapsed at my husband's work site klark Kent is not a hero.
my thought was,"anyone but Clark.
but I'm ready to make another splash.
standing in a downpour.
my detailed investigation has revealed.
didn't have an address or a family or a face.
look, Lois, this is a lot to take in...
Oh, well, there's actually a patient who's looking for you.
in fact, I spent a few hours of my morning...
forever.
watch.
in the middle of the bullpen?
I heard.
I'd see some things, too.
she's on her way right now.
but...
Clark...
I need to save her!
Oh, yeah.
Chloe
I'll get out of your way.
no.
I'm getting really good at it.
stop! Stop!
if you want to graduate
on a person's head.
to destroy our wedding.
no.
how's he doing?
alert Police stand off main and 5th
just one?
of course I trust you, Jimmy.
right.
I have put up with years
at a press conference,
what's happening?
we called the cops.
Jimmy.
Davis, it's okay.
don't bother. I quit.
well, does she have to?
you need to look the part.
here.
since when does Metropolis p. d.
get out of here!
you want me out of the way
Jimmy.
that made the Crows state champs.
alert! Male predator on the hunt, freeway accident tangles traffic
but you don't believe me.
Jimmy, I know you're upset,
let people get away with murder?
we'll always be there for each other.
but I didn't murder anyone.
look, I saw you
Jimmy, hey.
that you're hiding in here.
I don't know.
I'm doing pretty good.
Clark, I don't want to fire you.
get away from me!
I'm not changing my life
I thought you'd be happy.
Chloe!
people that I care about.
he's on some pretty heavy stuff.
come with me. I'll save you.
to see a plastic surgeon.
he ran.
it's a long flight.
they'll say the same thing.
you must've missed it.
we had the entire night staff
she was desperate to stop Lex.
I think that's a good idea.
from what I hear, he was lucky
scattered around the hospital, looking.
and you want me to go with you?
I think we can find something
to carry around whatever it is
Davis...
then my dad was coming in.
I'm sorry.
you were in a lot of pain.
no, Chloe, he was the killer.
Yeah. Well, thanks for the tip.
he kept a journal.
you're searching for pain meds?
were transferred into Luthercorp.
I really think that the future
Jimmy, what are you doing here?
I guess I'm just lucky
they can be highly addictive.
and a little more Louis Vuitton
well, okay,
are you thirsty?
Chloe, wait!
Jimmy! It's after me again!
got to help me.
I will be, too.
really does a job on you.
I...
but last night, I think I did.
that thing's killing Chloe!
well, you need to tell my doctor
steps out of the shadow into his red-and-blue,
are you all right?
with the world's worst coffee breath.
we were just leaving.
so what, you're gonna pull a quick costume change
wait!
nurse!
what the hell are you doing here?
isn't all physical.
Mr. Olsen, what did you take?
getting grilled by a homicide detective
Jimmy, calm down.
let go of me! It's attacking!
Chloe, please, go.
Yeah, you did see me. You did.
I haven't seen you this pumped
she tried to kill Lana.
a little less "high school musical
What'd it say?
it's not gonna give you more
and she was unconscious the whole time.
and landing in the Arizona desert
I am.
welcome aboard, Ms. Mercer.
I understand that what you told me
is what makes you so special,
that I brought into the e. r.
because Tess Mercer might know my secret.
thrown into a squad car last night,
if you want to fire me, Ms. Mercer, go ahead.
this just happens to be yours.
l. A.
about Lex's journal
red-blue blur to the rescue
No! No!
no. Not until you tell Chloe what you did.
he's that much closer to home.
on every single traffic cam in town?
I think there's a lot more to Clark Kent
that is a tough one to top, Chloe,
to make it past that creature alive.
I trust you with my whole heart. I'm your wife.
and then I spent the next six lovely hours
around here somewhere.
and I would hide in there
not to pre-empt your episode
it was quite the coming-out party.
good.
I know the tricks that pain-killers can play
I don't need a shrink, Chloe. I need to go home.
ms. Mercer is not in, Mr. Olsen.
with good.
media outlets report
looks a whole lot brighter for him.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
sir, settle down. - I'm fine!
well, it really is just my gym stuff,
you murdered that man.
so I wasn't hallucinating.
that even Clark Kent doesn't want to admit.
I guess it's just another sign
you don't know that for sure.
now, if I had that much morphine in my system,
to appear on video is not easy.
it gave you a double dose every time you hit the trigger.
good luck.
since you threw the touchdown pass
you need to quit the daily planet
Jimmy?
you need to be careful.
you have no free will.
put this on!
thank you, Captain Nichols.
so it's time to take extreme measures.
okay, stop.
I was up here looking for a patient
Clark, you were his obsession.
someone may have been trying to kill you.
and always see the good in people
of "America's next top model,
from the bullpen to the corner office,
that you just don't trust me.
and that's what I don't understand
Clark, you did everything you could.
I'll take that chance.
it's those damn drugs.
no. Of course not.
that you were in the right place at the right time.
you would've regretted the rest of your life.
I'm sorry.
you seem to be doing just fine.
home?
just breathe!
and she's getting closer by the minute.
I wasn't even sure it worked the first few times.
a lot of frequent-flyer miles lately.
and if she really wants to move more papers,
in Jimmy's psycho thriller.
No! No!
Jimmy...
Jimmy and I made it out of the dark forest,
your pca pump, it was faulty.
we need a shot of haldol-ativan.
Davis, I was with Jimmy yesterday
when you're starting a global endeavor.
but, you know, maybe what you're going through
now tell me yours.
to put it to an end.
Davis came after me, and I was protecting myself.
you don't know what you're doing.
after Lex died, all of his personal files
you're not yourself.
we've had two bottles of champagne.
we share all of our toys.
nurse!
when he tried to give himself an extra dose,
what?
what?
keep breathing!
uh, the truth is,
human.
but you've got a little bit of a...
Jimmy, they let me go.
it hasn't shown up again?
I'm not sure she's like Lex.
my pain is hummer-sized, not hybrid.
to withstand the effects of alcohol.
all your attention should be on Jimmy.
creating two completely separate identities.
nobody's childhood is perfect.
not like what my dad did.
well, whatever the case, she knows too much,
great.
well, Luthercorp and Queen Industries
we have no home, Chloe.
the sky is the limit.
first of all, we didn't fly. We sort of jumped.
and put the red-blue blur back into the closet.
Hey, slowing my superspeed down enough
without warning.
go home!
that we were meant for each other.
I accept...
and I had to have it sliced out.
perps, thieves,...
ceo and reporter survive jet crash
it makes me feel...
of your taking someone else's side over mine
it's hard to believe that he just dropped in
it's okay. I'll take you shopping when we get back.
I mean, you saved her by flying out of a falling jet.
get out of here now!
hurt?
I didn't murder anyone.
did you do anything to it?
into a set dosage.
when Lex and I had a real friendship.
Clark.
some drunk driver, fatal accident.
Clark...
Jimmy, go back to your room. Please!
I just told you mine.
how's the weather look in L. A?
I'm not surprised he thinks of me that way.
they let you out on bail?
that thing that did this, what was it?
did you figure out what brought down Oliver's jet?
Chloe?
there's nothing to tell.
I can hold my liquor like no other.
I found it stashed in the cabin locker.
you seem to have this inhuman ability
I came right after the police called.
so you can have her all for herself, don't you?
what is it?
are one big happy conglomerate now.
three times.
every cub reporter gets his big break.
but trust me, I just stopped you from doing something
I saw him murder someone right in front of me.
you think she knows your secret?
I mean, you're the one who convinced me
that the red-blue blur made more saves last night
than a Billy Graham revival meeting.
I'd like to think that there was a time
that's okay.
I'm sure that OIliver keeps a bottle of the good stuff
Jimmy, please, for your own good,
I'm sorry I can't say the same thing for Davis Bloome.
considering a man was murdered in this hospital last night,
only because she was trying to destroy the power suit.
would've slowed you down, but...
you never have.
I would think parachuting out of a jet
you're gonna be okay!
marrying you...
Chloe!
no more than three tablets a day.
well, she didn't exactly just come out and admit it.
couldn't take you away from me...
to include my true hollywood story, huh?
I'm just glad it has a happy ending.
I knew I was fine the moment that I woke up
I'm in a lot of pain here!
do you have more important things to do?
Jimmy, hey, no one is gonna blame you if you did.
Hello?
making a splash, but this is more like a tsunami.
if it means giving people hope, Chloe,
because the only reporters I want working for the planet
I'd better get back to the planet.
cause if the king kong of meteor freaks
look, I know what you did.
evil...
I don't think Oliver Queen would appreciate us
don't worry. We'll take care of him.
me too.
you're not even a cop.
ask the doctors, or ask one of the nurses.
being in a hospital bed for five weeks
I want to talk about you.
metropolis general hospital
I think he's gone forever.
the body...
Jimmy, help me!
in the meteor-freak capital of the world.
but not last night.
your ability to trust others
and I need a friendly reporter to lob softballs.
are those who take their jobs seriously.
and I get to pick up my wounded soldier.
I had these blue sheets
kind of like you, Clark.
just one of the pitfalls of getting hitched
he can't hurt you, Davis.
Jimmy's battle is finally over at met gen,
I know that you feel it, too.
and the machine wouldn't allow it.
I just want to make sure that your rush
but she's beyond dangerous, Clark.
but we must learn to control them.
you will eradicate the other Kryptonian.
and that, uh...
look at you now.
wardrobe malfunction.
you can talk to me.
look, I'm...okay. I'm, uh...
Chloe, working at the daily planet is a perfect cover.
he ran a red light last night.
why the hell did you even marry me?!
Yeah, but, Clark, did you have to make a guest appearance
I know what I saw, Chloe.
meet Davis Bloome
tell her to put this at the top of her to-do list.
Oh, it wasn't a niptuck.
say that Clark Kent, the unassuming journalist...
you don't have to worry about Tess Mercer or me.
okay, normally your eyes could be trusted,
he's gone now, so you can tell me
no, get back in your room! It'll hurt you!
no matter how many times you hit the pump.
and he broke my arm...
I'm sworn to secrecy.
from what I understand, you've been, uh, racking up
was a part of your past you'd like to keep private.
maybe this wouldn't have happened to him.
and, like I told you before, I'm...I'm moving on.
when I stop the wickedness that I see...
well, as terrible as it all was,
before the lunch whistle blew at the mill.
I know.
you're not exactly inspiring much confidence,
Chloe...
that he got the girl.
what body?
enjoy your new life, captain.
come back? Where are we going?
I'm gonna relieve Lois of her nurse's duties.
there is some sort of connection between us.
Oh. How much have you had to drink, man?
we would've heard about it.
drug dealers. There's so much...
have they found the pilot's body? - No.
I should've been able to protect him.
we may have to reroute and land in Santa Barbara.
especially after what happened last night.
you're not in this alone, you know.
I can't believe you're defending her.
I promise you I won't.
you stashed the body here till you could get rid of it.
wandering around the hall, completely out of it.
why would I cover my tracks?
I just got back from the gym.
Yeah, well, there are a lot of foreign titans to charm
and I don't think I want my boss going through my underwear.
I've seen the photographs
you'd rather believe anyone else but me.
well, thanks to you, I got cuffed,
and I have to go.
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
I have a strong metabolism.
I did kiss his bride.
I cannot let you in here! I'm calling security!
it is a dangerous world we live in.
look, I'm all about your streak of primary colors
Jimmy, you know that that machine's already locked
what happens when Tess Mercer gets her hands on those?
I bet you didn't expect the in-flight entertainment
I'm sure he wouldn't mind us drinking a few more glasses.
it's right there, Davis.
Lex was right about you, Clark.
I looked everywhere.
to embrace my double identity and inspire the world.
that sounds tough.
I know how much you enjoy playing Florence Nightingale,
standing by my side.
you don't...you don't need to hear that.
the crushed Porsche, t-the mushroomed bullets.
first Clark and then Davis?
I didn't know he was coming home today.
in time, I'm sure the truth will reveal itself.
I'm just glad you're okay.
that thing
fighting to get out.
it was nice of Oliver to let you use his private jet.
tower's informed me there's a storm coming into L. A.
you can trust me.
I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
so you murdered him?
look, if you're doing fine...
Jor-El warned me about an ultimate destroyer.
then we're gonna be together forever.
but it's also what keeps getting you into trouble.
you saved me.
and I may live in his mansion...
why would Lex have an entire room devoted to you?
can I get some more pain medicine, please?
but I'm not lex.
Jimmy!
bless me, father, for I have sinned.
skies are all clear.
I saw him last night, Chloe. He's still pretty shaken up.
that wasn't a friendship.
still, you don't deserve to be cast as the madman
the villagers already put away their pitchforks.
well, to anyone, really.
on the way back from a ballet recital.
okay, you still have a lot of drugs in your system, and
people are watching us. Can we talk about this at home?
did Lex talk to you about me?
I think I'm just good at covering my tracks.
that you had at the Kent farm.
daddy dearest used to be able to finish off a fifth
I am not going to hurt anyone.
I do everything in my power...
somehow I feel safe.
you don't know what you're seeing anymore.
and thankfully, now that Jimmy's been transferred to met gen,
I can't explain to you Lex Luthor's delusions.
but overcome evil...
it keeps the beast from coming out.
well, somehow it malfunctioned.
I may run his company...
I'm announcing the new Mercer media group
Lex wanted so much to be like you.
Jimmy... get away from me.
Lana told me what Lex put you through.
Lex Luthor lojacked me with some bio-tech hardware,
no need to. Yeah, that was way off base.
there's no telling where they'll take you.
look, I realize now...
come on, Jimmy. We can work through this.
in that Phoenix emergency room, to see you...
Hey, Chloe.
no. No, no, no. My mind has never been so clear.
what about what Lex put you through?
nifty knapsack, Kent. Are you on your way to P. E?
people who took away my hope.
that's what you want everyone to believe, isn't it?
maybe you should talk to a psychologist.
Oh, well, I... I just assumed
see, I thought it was just to cover up the murder.
he killed a young mother and her little girl
but when I'm around you...
there's a hole in the cockpit, and the pilot's gone!
enough about Lex's journal, okay?
finishing off his private reserve of 1919 cristal.
to inspire Joe six-pack doesn't unmask Clark Kent.
Clark, do something.
I am not going anywhere until you confess what you did.
and we didn't find him, but...I found you,
don't underestimate your talents, Kent.
what happened to Davis? Was he hurt?
it's a beast inside of me,
nice try, pal, but there is nothing wrong with that pump!
the bastard shattered my eardrum.
well, I-if I said anything or did anything
with me, it's what you see is what you get.
you're gonna be okay!
I got this cut in your ambulance when I saw the dead body.
Plus, I had to make a pit stop in Geneva
let's just say it wasn't the norman rockwell childhood
Yeah, I was able to, uh, strap it around both of us.
Something...takes over...
stay on your righteous path, my son.
that I used to pull up over my head...
and I feel terrible.
sin committed on those streets.
Davis, hey, I feel terrible.
be not overcome of evil.
I -- I drive through Metropolis at night,
why is it that he's dead and we're still alive?
was the biggest mistake of my life.
I hope that this experience has brought us closer.
I didn't, um, I didn't tell him.
there's not a bad bone in your body.
the NTSB is still investigating the explosion.
but I can take care of myself.
I'm here, my son. Go on.
and, uh, pretend to be the little mermaid,
searching for a way to save myself.
I guess the lucky part was finding that parachute.
but he knew. He knew in his heart he never could.
he pretended to be your friend for how many years?
if you're worried that I'm gonna tell someone your secret...
I wouldn't want you to think I'm not taking my job seriously.
Jimmy, I'm glad to see you're feeling better.
it's in the Mercer genes.
Lex was a lot of things, but he was not delusional.
to give him reason to hate me, I hope we can get past it.
the guy, the...the drunk driver...he's dead!
and if Jimmy needs anything, um, I'm here.
I...have hurt many people
and maybe that isn't such a bad thing.
and it made me feel like I was underneath the ocean.
Jimmy, I wasn't the one that was practically mauled to death.
I just can't help but wonder that if he had never met me,
and w-when I come across...
but then I saw you holding Chloe outside my room.
Yeah, but I bet you were read fairy tales at bedtime...
Yeah, about the parachute -- where was that?
waiting, dreaming of my prince to come rescue me.
we all have our inner demons,
and when I find someone who's lost their way, I reach out.
I looked everywhere, and I can't find the parachutes!
I'm trying, father, the best way I know how.
my whole life, I've had to deal with abusive people,
I don't usually open up about myself to...
who are you?
Clark...
you know what I mean?
Clark...
how?!
Chloe.
for the realm of Kandor!
what's up?
I'll fly coach.
he's probably afraid...
I kissed her.
got your attention.
I'm fine.
who are you?!
your tomb raiders
I've been home for weeks.
no.
all right, look,
what happened?
Clark.
I'll do this by myself.
tell me!
Oliver's right, Clark.
Clark.
I'll need all those blood samples.
I just don't know what happened.
and it's not Zod.
I had my people grab something much more valuable from your cellar.
you're not in any place where ...
I went over there to talk to her.
to meet my real father...
thank you, Zod.
you know everything.
we'd better start looking.
Shelby.
Kandor.
like a walkabout?
come on. - Chloe.
and take a peek by yourself.
Jor·El.
release Jor·El.
you have no authority here.
all you have to do is to ask yourself.
council.
we do not have the right.
my son.
his name's Jor·El!
there's...
you're lying.
a friend.
cause I'm gonna need your help.
the shields...
what do you want?
whose blood I need, major Zod.
medic.
I-I...
for going on that date with Lois,
who are you?
and then you'll finally...
why, Clark?
thank you.
be careful, Zod.
don't look at me, man.
I know you and I
Oliver, let's not
and I'm gonna warn you...
you didn't tell me anything about them.
she's Kandorian.
no.
do you know what you're doing?
I don't understand.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
to speak to an actual person.
major, I don't understand.
soldiers, move out!
I'd say you're both heroes.
and Kal·El.
now, you...
uh, no, you won't.
you're the last of your battalion
I don't know.
but you did have it.
or kill her.
Jor·El betrayed us.
you came with us in the orb,
I'm fine.
I, uh...
for the realm of Kandor! For the realm of Kandor!
is usually to blow out of town.
but not to worry.
and yet we have none?
before he knocked me out,
get to meet your son.
maybe a little blue man group.
Yeah, I'm not surprised，Clark.
kneel.
her operatives have had their noses, deep in the Turkish desert, sniffing around for weeks.
Zod has him.
how would you know that?
so did Zod.
our lives went on.
Chloe?
if you raced here to see me,
Chloe, are you all right?!
my wife...
look, just take my word for it,
the next thing I know, I couldn't stop myself.
that you still need to hear.
to get away from me.
get on with it.
you're lying.
Where's my father?
Kal·El...
Hey, are you okay? Wake up!
I thought Kandor exploded with the rest of Krypton.
if it wasn't for Zod,
but I'll not let my life's work
the bitter truth.
and Jor-El didn't tell me.
so -- so when you say "Jor-El,
Chloe, he ... he came all the way to the farm,
this is the same selfish morality.
away from his people...
on earth.
decimating his ranks,
where is he?
right, soldiers?!
the clones inside will develop extraordinary abilities under their yellow sun.
you're Kandorian?
save...
I'll get you help.
the orb is ready.
you are mistaken.
I have no child.
trying to bring the E. T.s home.
Jor·El said if she's here, there may be others.
Jor·El.
close to my heart.
small price to pay for immortality.
is a sense of humor.
the Daily Planet, and this house.
when you told me you could help me find my father,
I don't know.
and give her a little bit of space.
I want to see him now!
No!
so we could locate him.
I can't let this project go on.
and we want to get back to our families.
but he certainly wasn't alone.
you used my father as bait!
make her tell you where this blur is.
and in the meantime,
the same night that Zod arrived these symbols appeared all over the world.
we were right.
I wasn't even wearing red or blue.
although, I may be responsible for your cousin vanishing from prime time.
who have come here with you.
our survivors on earth.
that might lead us to your father.
because I can't get a call in to him.
the noose is getting tighter.
because I see it.
they're like high-temperature brands left when a Kandorian first arrives on earth.
you made it to Smallville.
now, I think that you should wing out there
you realize the council won't like this.
Jor·El...
I'm still gonna put up a fight, but...
and I still don't have what I want.
you might recognize this one.
why don't you just let me talk to her?
there's a war to be won,
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
please.
it doesn't have a happy ending.
because while we were enjoying our drink,
and Jor-El...
Oliver can get you there first class.
look, man, I...
you could've ever hoped for...
well, the council can do what it will,
Krypton lost mothers...
for now.
they will be difficult to find.
well, you sent him here as a baby.
why won't they let me in?
when my dad died, I remembered thinking
Jor-El didn't give me the Kryptonian sleeper hold.
the technology I created.
you could've at least taken me to Nevada.
his son.
might have a different opinion.
I didn't know it was because you wired my house.
not exactly five star, is it?
we are partners now, after all.
and I'll tell you what -- I'd go to hell and back
children.
Clark's mother, she's...
Clark, I was just trying to protect you.
fathers...
hear you need a lift.
but he didn't stay to see me?
Tess Mercer has teams around the globe.
I found no one. Where are you hiding him?
no, no, no, no. D-don't give me excuses.
you know what I'm getting you next year for Christmas?
there's a few more chapters on Zod.
call it a mission of redemption.
reveals a new riddle...
who did this to you?
the same way I corrupted the orb.
well, hello.
he came with us in the orb,
with someone else.
you didn't put them in Metropolis, did you?
my father.
this calls for a celebration.
but I'm glad to see that his untimely death
you chose to raze our planet.
come on, you know I always speed over when you call.
each one of you,
but there is one thing I can relate to,
he must have known what it would mean to me.
let them find it on the battlefield!
Clark must be flying through some turbulence.
if our planet is ever destroyed.
my orders come from the ruling council itself.
but I'm sure that he'll touch down soon,
I do remember seeing a whole new side of Clark Kent.
I shall never tell you.
look, I don't expect you to believe me.
you're his son.
Jor·El...
I have no powers.
if the ruling council wants my blood,
tells you to stop, then you stop.
look, um...
it was the only way you could save him.
but those we were created from
Oh, yeah, that would definitely send her packing.
he will lead us to the one that will give us our powers ...
and grew up alone.
he came with us in the orb.
Jor·El.
tonight.
after seeing how he saved our spunky sidekick,
that I'm not interested.
you've read your Shakespeare.
I know how you feel, okay?
I never liked needles.
whether she doth or not,
how did we get here?
he has power from the yellow sun.
unfortunately, my wings are still clipped.
as equals.
they will see you.
we both know that's not true.
Jor-El"?
have been digging in that desert for weeks,
together.
you do understand.
intimately.
look, whatever you did to him,
I received your message.
who else does he know in Smallville?
this is my son.
I've already checked every Luthorcorp facility,
well, unless you want to end up the same way,
we could've hit the Strip before the main event,
never forget that, my friend.
it is agreed.
save him?
major Zod.
m-my father's here?
you know who I'm talking about.
you know, Clark, if you wanted to bury me in the desert
I wanted to keep an eye on your place until you came home.
I think your deep-cover agent
how bad is it?
at least I'd have the memories of being with him.
daughters...
I have not forgotten.
you've had feelings for Lois since like the 1930s.
you wanted Zod to find him...
somebody that did not come with us...
the Kryptonian symbols that we saw at watchtower
he sensed danger. He was trying to save you.
none of you recall that tragic day...
Lara.
every sip...
don't go.
please...
he survived. - He didn't just survive.
looks like you've already been celebrating.
sons.
I was wondering when you were gonna make your move.
defend yourself!
I can't believe my father's been on earth this whole time
empty feeling inside.
because it is the truth.
we had families, spouses...
how could you?
maybe we need to look deeper.
Kandor is gone!
you leave us no choice.
find him!
my friend...
if you've never had a child?
Clark, before you burst a blood vessel, let me explain.
just when I thought you'd flown off my radar.
I'm sorry. I can see how upset you are.
and I can assure you, they'll wait for no one.
are we talking about the dude in your ice-crystal-palace thing?
why did you come to Smallville today?
I mean, no offense to you, Clark.
you're gonna do something you'll regret, you understand?
but I'll take what I can get.
when we find this traitor...
with or without his powers.
the sandstorms have not let up since we arrived.
and the bravery in your hearts!
because the moment your blood was taken
if ever they are resurrected.
or war...
there's only one person who would send operatives to kidnap him,
we were shadows of our former selves.
well, I'm sure there's a reason he didn't tell you the truth.
Jor·El?
well, maybe he wasn't around other Kryptonians,
but to creation.
but I can assure you...
here on the farm.
I'm afraid you've only lived half the story.
okay, hold on.
you have a flair for the dramatic.
it seemed as though he had some unfinished business...
not here with you?
you help me find him...
Zod.
but I don't know who you're talking about.
I'm sorry.
he's here on earth.
you shouldn't have done that!
what good will come if you extinguish another life unnecessarily?
see, now I'm impressed.
and yet he flaunts them...
but I think the cameras may have actually recorded something.
where is he?
but I know what he becomes.
not if they turn out like your son.
whatever or whoever was here is either dead or buried.
my wife...
if you want to save your son...
the forces of black zero are closing in on Kandor,
that's why I released you all from that orb.
it's all I have left of my son.
they're very well trained
look, we've been searching for all the others.
I would've expected as much.
spouses, children.
to figure out who killed my father...
there's a part of me that doesn't want to meet him at all.
for the realm of Kandor!
I have many very fond memories here.
major Zod has been turning this planet upside down looking for a man who we call "the blur.
I wanted to see the place again.
the wine cup...
so I could always keep my most precious treasure.
I think it's the least you can do.
I have waited so long.
I used the blue Kryptonite to take them away,
tell me who did this to you!
you said ... you said after we were put in the orb,
good.
well, I demand to be heard.
it may, in fact, destroy it.
but it is not an exact science.
we're at the exact coordinates Chloe gave us.
Oh, my god.
how could you fathom my pain...
and bring him to justice.
like you betrayed me?
many years later,
I suggest you get the job done.
so none of you could rule this planet as gods.
trust me -- the Kents are the greatest parents.
Clark found your markings in the desert.
just to wrap my arms around my old man one more time.
why are you involved in our affairs?
the last sons and daughters of Krypton,
figure out who he really was.
he's at your farm.
if the Kandorians get their powers,
I've seen what you've done for the humans in Metropolis.
the only alien I know is standing right in front of me.
Zod, there's nothing you can do!
you know him as the blur.
I can save you.
my wife gave me this before I went off to battle...
I'm truly sorry.
my name is Jor·El.
I've seen that before in the mirror...
I can't give you what you want.
yet you harnessed the powers of the yellow sun for yourself.
it's time you did something for your own people.
perhaps you are right.
well, your instincts about the Kents paid off.
when Kandor fell,
a man named Jor·El...
let Jor·El live.
are all that is left from our beloved homeland.
I see what mankind is doing to this planet.
how dare you deny me this request.
it must mean the "I love Lois" show was preempted this week.
you really mean that, or is that the anger talking?
be used to commit an atrocity.
I can't save Zod.
he took all of our powers for himself.
Clark is the most amazing person I've ever met.
so I can hold him in my arms again.
a new truth.
Zod doesn't even know that Kal·El exists.
and your race is the only answer to saving it.
I see my crack security team is on the job.
you have operatives all over the world tracking aliens.
I'm guessing you're not here to cheer on the troops.
you're protecting someone...
medic, when the most renowned scientist in Krypton
let's just say that the, um...
she's gonna use the Watchtower to figure out what really happened.
all over this city...
I was wondering why she skipped town without saying goodbye.
I won't be toyed with.
to be better than we were before.
my luthorcorp mole dug up some more information on the Kandorians.
Krypton is gone because you destroyed it.
the earth is doomed.
someone from the house of El.
he didn't have to die.
you give us our powers.
a battalion of soldiers led by a great commander and the best friend I ever had, Zod.
the bottled-up hopes and dreams of Kandor,
who put your shield out in the middle of nowhere?
to work with us, and now you can...
I'll give you what you've always wanted.
I worry that he isn't the only one I've influenced.
so your son is safe...
by my side...
and your own.
it seems to me like you're a chip off the old block.
because I'm not the enemy here.
then what you've done will not save this planet.
every time we're together, I discover something new.
Krypton was destroyed.
Kent Farm.
the council will spare your life.
that's impossible.
I, Zod, am in your debt.
I'm saddened that he spent his entire youth
I'm here to take my favorite blonde for a walk.
I'll never be able to live up to everything he accomplished.
and like my superpowered Kryptonian comrade,
now, I let him believe that you have all the powers.
I am Jor·El, your father.
sorry about the accommodations.
you must include major Zod's DNA...
don't worry, Clark.
to live among the humans, to be different...
so are these ... the stones of knowledge.
but I had to take drastic measures to protect you.
but if you didn't know that your son even existed,
of course he did, Clark.
and somehow, he stole our powers from us.
but if we send the orb to earth and it is opened,
there can be complications, mutations.
was the last moment you remember of Kandor.
there's nothing more important than finding the Kandorians.
stayed behind on Krypton and had full lives ...
you have to make a sacrifice.
it looks like you had another reason for coming to Smallville.
I've already got a team on it.
here on this planet, when we emerged from the orb,
I beg of you...
it's just Lois' typical response to intimacy
I felt so much love in his house.
he's amusing, but...
Zod is a foe not to be taken lightly...
let black zero feel the bite of your weapons
out here, the temperature would melt the sand into glass.
but we cannot change the past.
I set up those cameras when you left after your last dance with doomsday.
somebody you'd give your life for.
Hello, old friend.
if truth there be, doth dwell.
you owe this to me.
you never would've betrayed Krypton.
that kept me from ever seeing my son again.
you're Clark's father.
think of how you'd feel if you had a son!
I asked Chloe to scan all the footage she has from the farm.
the orb will ensure that Krypton's strongest will endure
you owe this to us!
look, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but...
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.
just like you, Tess.
the same person that told you of Krypton's destruction...
I don't think anyone wears that super shield quite like you.
the punishment for treason is death.
I got your back ... always.
you could bring him back to me.
look, Clark, I'm sorry, okay?
not to resurrect the dead through cloning.
but going off to confront Tess all eyes ablazing is not a good idea.
he has dedicated his life's work not to death...
maybe a little carrot top.
and what's he doing here on earth?
so you could find the others.
she wasn't part of the experiment.
the humans will be powerless against them.
with Jor-El being gone, all I'm left with is...
relax, it's just a pinprick.
I can guarantee she won't be revealing any more...
you might remember him as a friend.
the last thing we remember is our blood being taken in Kandor.
the lady doth protest too much.
my father sent me here when I was younger.
you are as dead to me as my son.
perhaps you should've had more faith in your own race.
perhaps if I'd given you what you wanted,
I may have driven black zero back into the ice,
considering what happened the last time we met...
which is why I want you to help me protect Kal·El.
well, your Kryptonian instincts must be on the fritz
I just came to get a progress report on our search for Jor-El.
I feel your pain now more than ever.
I find the pleasure I get from wine much more satisfying.
after everything I've done for you...
I had a tracking device put on Jor·El's clothes...
haven't always seen eye to eye lately, but, uh...
when I prayed that you would bring my son back to me.
Clark, we don't get a second chance to be with them.
so, this is my son.
JorEl, you lied to me.
and that's growing up without parents.
for you to admit your true Kryptonian heritage.
I implore you all...
now, you opened that orb,
then he sacrificed himself again to protect my secret.
is the truest hero I have ever known.
I always hoped you'd tell me because you trusted me.
that look in your eye...
the council's demands have been met.
and not just some voice in the Arctic.
but on the eve of your defeat, instead of surrendering,
we are abominations that should never have been created.
there's a civil war raging, and you're wasting time.
still, he sacrificed so much sending me to this planet.
how can you protect anyone when your only concern is yourself?
you are mistaken to think that we are so different from humans.
and perhaps that's why I sent Kal·El here.
but, again, Jor-El kept me in the dark.
you decided to lead a military coup to take over Krypton.
his Kryptonian name is Kal·El.
you stand before the ruling council charged with treason.
I'm gonna need a little bit more information, like a name.
your passion is noted, major.
you're hiding something with selfless conviction.
but my accomplishments pale in comparison to this man's.
we've been given a second chance to have lives here on earth,
and your guidance helped make him into the man he is.
if not, Zod will find out about him.
I wouldn't be here, and neither would my son.
see, I had so many questions I wanted to ask him.
your presence is an honor, but this is a closed trial.
which is why you will understand why I need you to do this for me.
all that is left is for you and I to include our DNA.
you must convince the Kandorians that you are the blur.
Kandorian border 20 years before. The destruction of Krypton.
and I can't wait to see what my next sip reveals.
is the little silver well where truth...
this is my favorite discovery on your little planet.
I'm sorry. I...I didn't know.
I'll let you know when we find Jor·El.
if that fateful day of judgment ever comes to Krypton...
use these fragile cells to bring my little boy back...
Jor-El isn't the only one who came in for the Kryptonian reunion.
I don't see anything for miles but sand.
was intended to heal those afflicted by wars and disease,
we're keeping this partnership strictly professional.
I met a man called Hiram Kent.
I'm so proud of you ... so proud.
many of our brightest and most promising citizens perished in an instant.
Zod is the only person responsible for choosing to become a monster.
perhaps I played my part in making Zod the man he became.
I can't imagine what it's like to live your life.
leaving his mark for us to see.
our sacred book of Rau teaches that where there is light there is darkness.
that in person, he's worse than I thought he was.
and I will not allow for your birthright to be denied.
and he may very well kill my son.
the teachings of the 28 galaxies will be available to our people,
Clark!
somebody!
Lois?
go figure.
now, here's the hitch.
this is our evidence.
in Metropolis.
it was a disaster.
Lois...
you've had trouble with lately.
we don't know that.
help!
I've changed.
pretty slick, Z.
zip it, counselor.
you've come quite a long way
easy, Armstrong.
it's okay.
I need a signature.
Lois?
about what you see and hear,
and if you chat one word
Lois, I tried.
it's not his M. O.
Clark, why?
than people are seeing.
I call him "Sacks-ophone"
Lois.
with Clark Kent.
is that...
you have superpowers.
you freeze the girl out,
please.
than anyone else.
Lois?
but, hey, I'm open.
I can't!
not exactly.
go!
what the blur stands for.
what do we do?
you've been eavesdropping
I just created a program
Lois!
maybe.
way to go aggro, J.
up until today,
Dr. Evans...
I never thought I'd say this,
you're just gonna have to do something
Marjorie?
Clark!
I'm a cop!
he's out cold.
because he doesn't have his go-to girl to keep him grounded.
you're a guy.
it's the blur's sidekick.
with people's private lives.
where are we?
Clark! You gotta see this!
Where'd you get that?
Oh, you want to go there?
are you sure you don't have it?
there is no try, skywalker.
you're a gem.
I took the elevator.
Lois.
No!
if I hadn't stepped in,
what's with the disguise?
speak of the devil.
you're breaking my heart, Lane.
you know, with some training,
and it's not fair.
just hold on.
did you see that guy's face?
but I'm not that fast.
think we should tie him up?
to get the superhero swag.
CK Cell
all right, hold on.
thanks to the fog and dog duo,
Lois.
since being scarecrowed in high school.
leave it alone, inspector gadget.
once the police see this,
Hello, Lois.
after what happened with Corben,
but that was just ...
big news day.
wasn't totally about you.
this is the blur's lair.
you can reach!
not the blur, you coward!
the blur is back on top!
how did you let that happen?
later this afternoon.
your eyes still closed?
maybe you should focus
I used to unwrap all my presents
gun it!
taking down the blur's blog.
more real, actually.
welcome to watchtower.
okay.
what else is there to know?
could you lose the notebook?
let's see what you've got.
come on, stretch.
this isn't what I had in mind
I put my shield out there
it's because he knows
holy hacking.
grab my hand.
on some serious spin-doctor magic,
don't believe in me.
he vanished?
just what I've always wanted.
and keeping an eye on you two.
I think he'd be pretty happy
What?!
without proof,
nobody's gonna buy the misguided-fans angle.
it's too far!
Lois Lane, Daily Planet.
that got you trussed up like a turkey?
don't worry, Smallville.
they may be able to give the blur
and then there's playing big brother
and everything that it stands for.
I think it's pretty obvious.
all right, let's go.
you're just a couple of mega fans
protect some feckless meteor freaks.
you're risking a lot to
I must have been crazy
and now he's overnighting our boys in blue?
because whoever's posing as the blur
he called.
the street vendor on the corner.
but...
you'd better find a better way
I'm doing pro bono for the blur
so, who are you?
after weeks of no contact.
sayonara, superstud.
I wish we had more time.
I am the shield.
okay, they're not that different.
that's all right. That's all right. Let her up.
first, the blur doesn't call for weeks,
that taps into cellphone frequencies.
you're alive.
the D. A.'s out for blood.
sacks is on his way to the slammer.
I hope you didn't misunderstand
we did it.
it's you, J.
Lois, who was that?
out of my way! Excuse me!
about my carbon footprint lately,
ever?
we should talk about it.
cause he loves to blow his own horn!
I'm a bit nearsighted.
and I don't know what to do.
let's just get some shots to upload.
means I'm probably wasting my time
since his Christmas-card roster
you know, Clark, you need to get to work
relax, Clark.
what's easier to believe?
I'm sure he'd be happy to learn
move it or lose it.
just run with it.
heroes don't get second chances,
anyway, I've been thinking a lot
wait.
what are you doing? You're in the shot.
ladies and gentlemen.
you can do that?
time to motor.
Clark Kent?
if they were the same person.
as we speak, they're in Watchtower,
it had to have been the blur.
Hey, they were undercover.
you are.
I'm not exactly the great and powerful Oz.
you are, aren't you?
the last time you had a coming-out party,
who really want to make a difference,
thank you. Meet me on the roof.
I know that you've been living two lives
are the same person.
but just so you're clear on one thing.
I'd prefer that all our meetings
Chloe, there's keeping a bird's-eye view,
I have you to thank for that.
this makes up for everything.
sorry.
to disguise your superhero scent.
reads like a soprano's hit list.
he may have stopped a diamond heist,
in his own way.
to the world.
so, how did you guys end up on the street?
whether this person means well or not,
care to comment on what illegal activities you've been up to
I'm not a brand.
have just come home to roost.
I know what I have to do.
but you are single-handedly destroying
Smallville.
I take the nicest guy that I know,
and you did.
do not toss! Fragile.
why don't you pick up a phone?
I'm here because I think it's a travesty
why don't you start
but you stick around a hero long enough
this can't be good.
could this have something to do
you know, just because you threw a few switches
personally...
they were just misguided fans.
the blur
Oh, man!
what is this, "nightline"?
on the man that's right in front of you.
is a genius at marketing and self-promotion.
whoa, what the...
what changed?
all my flannel's at the dry cleaner's.
Lois, you are not crazy.
I think he's actually trying to help you.
no, come on, Z, there's no way.
Lois has to know the blur is not responsible
let me go.
Clark...
I thought, you know,
they're very...
the ride would give us a chance
remain off-the-record.
turns out Adrian Pope, the organized crime boss,
good afternoon.
and believe me,
she's gonna give you a cold shoulder, hero or not.
when is the D. A. not out for blood?
I'm flattered, Lois.
did I ever tell you that before Christmas,
Lois, take a step back.
it also comes in t-shirts and key chains.
the blur.
doesn't make up for all your bonehead moves lately.
Oh, my god.
they're called contacts.
Thanks, doc.
come on, Zan. Let's fly.
code of silence all the way.
Lois, hold on.
to carry his secret all this time.
that I included his side of the story.
don't be so hard on yourself.
listen, Lois.
not your shield.
a lack of clothing in a dream
this space case is buried in research.
you don't.
metropolis doesn't need more blur fans.
I must have dropped it back at the power plant.
it sounds crazy,
in order to create your dream man?
but I'm beginning to lose faith in our resident hero.
but it would be so much easier
I can't believe she's not picking up.
I'm Lois Lane from the Daily Planet,
my desk is soft-core central.
your wonder twins will be a household name.
for an expos? On the hush-hush.
they need to be stopped...
there's no way the botched save is the work of the blur.
as Metropolis' blur worked overtime
Lois!
deep down, I never doubted him.
that's because you're some fancy hero.
of saying that you hate these?
once the bloodhound Lois is at your door,
is this your long-winded way
I totally tanked this one.
got to give props to the man.
chalk another one up to the blundering blur.
onto someone close to you.
the same? - Unbelievable.
with all this head-shrink mumbo-jumbo stuff.
powers, activate.
that's insane, Lois.
some much-needed backup in the halls of justice.
you'll know.
we believe in you, master b.
or his ego has gotten really supersized.
we're all undercover cops!
is this about what happened?
and probably a threat to the city.
I'm not turning them over to the D. A,
and neither does he.
where everything I type in here comes out blur.
is still on the street because of the blur's blunder.
Oh, for a long time now, we've only had each other.
I know I sort of pulled you into this,
lots of skin.
and I've been monitoring all cell communication
next thing you know,
I have a top-secret interview I'm doing
you're gonna have to trust me.
there's something on the building.
I'll have to take a rain check on the carpooling.
Lois, what's going on?
better?
Hey, J. So, what's going on?
you're the one who's hiding in the shadows,
Lois, you're not making any sense.
but my thoughts...
what do you think is more likely ...
she's the only one who can tell the world the truth.
it's him.
so, you finally heard from him. - Yeah.
just your typical sleight-of-the-ear stuff.
I think I get a free pass on that one.
the blur has an imposter nipping at his heels?
how can we make up for what we've done?
I focused on the man in my dreams,
okay.
you're not the one who lost her phone.
that your faith in the blur never wavered.
without breaking somebody's neck.
two hours to get here with the monorail down.
listen, just see this as an opportunity
nobody will ever believe you.
and apparently, you Twitter and you're on Facebook,
of course you would say that, Clark.
to investigate both sides of the story.
Lois?!
Clark Kent.
remember to watch your step.
thank you.
that's exactly what you have to do. I'm sorry.
I'm wearing my father's shield now.
he just doesn't deserve the silent treatment
our sting went south.
but the 20-story calling card was unmistakable.
of course, he's probably tailspinning into the stratosphere
and so is Clark...
Lois?
I stopped calling her as the blur for her own protection.
they'll be off our backs for your genius cops-in-a-box idea.
Clark, hey.
listen, I am not your blur girl on this one.
let me tell you about second chances, buddy.
it's all your parents' fault.
you don't really think this is big news, do you?
I wasn't the one behind the saves.
with your three weeks of blocked memory?
nobody can be two different people.
district attorney Sacks.
just don't touch anything, okay?
he doesn't have a lair.
you came to me to explore the deeper meaning
all right, let's get out of here.
I had to be the first one on the block
my mystery caller is brave and selfless,
the blur has a blog.
you know, Lois, that doesn't surprise me at all.
I know you want to honor your father, Clark.
look, I've been where you guys are. I get it.
when you said you wanted to meet in the copy room,
I got a delivery out back, and nobody's in yet.
I'll admit sugar-coating isn't exactly his style,
hold on, I'm coming.
I didn't pick up.
and I've worked hard to give people a symbol of hope,
just stay here.
but, professionally,
for the failed drug bust or the crime boss getting away.
next time you take on the D. A. Of Metropolis,
even from themself.
Lois...
it was a sort of last-minute vacation, wasn't it?
Yeah. The D. A. is kicked out.
there's no room for mistakes.
on my personal calls with Lois, haven't you?
that's not gonna happen.
she said sometimes you need to save a hero,
when I heard the blur's voice again,
not when the world is watching.
of the unattainable men you tend to fall for
I hacked into the security cameras on the rooftop,
but his blackout belly flop has crippled Metropolis.
and the fact that you haven't gotten that news flash
that's him, ancient history.
there's got to be something to this therapy stuff.
has a nice ring, doesn't it?
and having to lie to me about it every day.
last night was a whirlwind of happy endings
and then re-wrap them while my parents were still sleeping?
when I want to talk about it, I'll send up a smoke signal.
either the blur is hitting a quarterlife crisis,
that there was some phone glitch,
you tell me the color of your underwear every day.
you seen today's news?
how did we even get here?
Oh, wait until I tweet everybody about this.
I was dangling 100 stories above the pavement.
But...we're not the hero.
I guess I have more backup than I thought.
our tweets are totally sealed.
nice and easy.
excuse me? Can you help me?
wait, you're not gonna hand us over to the cops, are you?
and I'm here to tell you that I know the blur.
coming off -- you know, naked.
I can make him whoever I want him to be.
don't tell me you're taking that blowhard seriously, Clark.
Lois, I can't help but think there's more to this story
your father lives on through you...
it just takes a little doubt.
that's the point of therapy -- to learn about yourself.
all my blur-bashing I did yesterday.
and more than anything,
a light in the darkness,
to actually find five minutes to give me a call.
now you hear it, now you don't.
well, that would require a certain supersomeone
look, this guy's gonna call you a menace and a coward,
someone must have thought you were the real dealers.
he's co-opted your brand.
there's a woman hanging from the building.
I've been trying not to wear them.
he's just trying to cover up his dirty connections.
and now I found out that my mystery caller and Clark
okay, look.
the least I could do is put things right.
before someone gets hurt.
I don't know how old-school journalists broke a story
and how'd you know what to say to convince Lois?
just because he's been out there saving people.
to get past the whole kiss-and-run of it all,
that depends on you.
and you have to let people believe his lies.
it's gonna be okay.
think about it. Who else could have stopped us?
don't worry ... the twittering twosome have sung their last song.
or that you're trying to make them one person
hope I made up for not calling.
my story about the blur made it above the fold.
want me to help you with this? - No.
well, then what are we waiting for? - We can't just ditch Chloe.
I keep going back to Clark.
of course, he never explained why he didn't call me back.
something stirred inside of me.
since when did you become the blur's big defender?
Lois would still be beating down the "Clark is a superhero" door,
within these vivid dreams that you've been having.
I won't just do nothing while the D. A. drags down my father's crest
thank you all for joining me.
it's not that simple.
obviously not done by you.
I spy with my little eye a potential witness.
so, it's a sex dream?
you know he's just gunning for the mayor's office.
Susan, I'm not here because I'm running for mayor.
remember 8-tracks and rotary phones?
are you turning red?
there's a way you treat a woman. It's called respect.
I mean, how do you always know the right thing to do?
but if you sacrifice yourself, there is no shield.
you look pretty chipper. Busy night?
and all of this doesn't have to be taken literally.
we just wanted to help fuel the blur's legend.
powers, activate.
and...get to know each other better.
you just wait for the right moment.
with the co-worker you mentioned before?
you said I had a secret. You're right.
sometimes even from himself.
I just want to tell him that it doesn't matter to me.
what if someone's already on to us?
but maybe we're just not hero material.
the blur's in even deeper, and it's all our fault.
pull over by the power station.
how'd you know when to make the call?
shady Sacks sucks the city dry.
all your shady back-room deals with organized crime
I didn't realize you were filling in for the paper boy.
I feel like he's going to disappear.
why would the blur suddenly turn into a murderer?
I've got like two weeks' worth of work to catch up on.
now, that's what I call a scoop.
I wish I could.
I wish I could have been the one to rescue you,
so, the blur trusts you, right?
and I weigh him down with all this shining armor.
there are these newfangled things you can try.
to stop this vigilante behavior
he put the ball back in my court.
cheers -- for earning another strike today.
earth to Lois.
I suppose you were the one who gave us that little reboot.
who could be responsible for such a superscrew-up?
but the closer I get to him, the more...
since when is a veteran D. A. newsworthy?
now, I will be holding a press conference
Yeah, well, I've got a pretty tightly wound bolt reflex.
you don't give people enough credit.
so don't follow me.
really, the situation involves clothes...
and you get your share at saving him...
nobody really bought us as transfer students from Sweden.
maybe you're trying to protect yourself, Lois.
it's like you've been on another planet for the last 15 minutes.
I can't believe how difficult this must have been for him
we promised her we'd lay low till this all blows over.
even after all this, you still can't tell me.
in this great city of ours.
and I never would have guessed that your mysterious caller
and I figured, you know, we could start carpooling.
you still have strong feelings for this mystery man.
I discovered five messy, but successful, saves
or that the farm guy who sits across from me every day
to bring the city out of the darkness and into the light.
I need a feature on the blur's questionable tactics by the end of the day.
and I saw things clearly for the first time.
by describing these dreams you've been having?
I am happy to see that you're alive, Lois.
he would show himself
you talk a good game, counselor.
all right, yes, I'm doing the virtual "Kama Sutra"
that the best way for him to protect you and I
you can't reveal yourself to the cameras.
that your mysterious caller and Clark are the same man,
believe it or not, my ejector-seat malfunction...
to inspire people to step up and be their own heroes.
most importantly, believe in yourselves.
not you, not me, not even the blur.
and ... and now he can hold down an alter ego?
I'll only call you four-eyes every once in a while.
I will never take you for granted again, I swear.
why would somebody go through so much trouble to discredit me?
and to take responsibility for his actions.
look, I know you think you're pretty good at this head-shrinking stuff.
but doesn't everyone deserve a second chance?
easy on the dress-down, Clark, okay?
and the scavengers have already started circling.
come join me at this very podium,
to look at Clark through blur-colored glasses.
I had no idea how close a relationship you had.
and take your place as a role model
it's my hero complex to resolve.
I can't believe I was so stupid.
where you have 10, 000 friends, by the way.
it's just sometimes I feel like I see a whole other side of you
when you said you had looked into the blur's heart,
skin, skin on skin, just
well, the blur can't.
I've always known, deep down, that you were a hero.
I am asking the blur to come out of the shadows,
and I'll overlook your annoying antics.
the blur can't expect me to be his beck-and-call girl
I will vaporize your Twitter accounts, Facebook pages.
it means a lot that you thought I had it in me.
is a superpowered hero?
I woke up this morning...
but thanks to you, my head is about to explode,
you mean too much to the city...
unfortunately, that's not a story you're gonna get to write.
I don't think it's powdered sugar, Smallville.
that this city has been brought to its knees by the blur.
I've picked out a nice little font for my expos?
in a way, the city going dark was my fault.
the Halley's comet of phone dating himself.
sorry. This is a really bad time for your P. R. queen to go M.I.A.
Oh, she had to take off. Family issues.
I guess you're not the only one who's a little shortsighted.
believe in the shield and what it represents.
something that they can believe in, that will inspire them.
I'm telling you, this tech is definitely off the grid.
I just want to help, but I'm not sure how.
can signify the desire to uncover what's actually hidden.
and people need you to make life-and-death decisions every day.
dad always used to say we're stronger when we stick together.
but you don't believe a word of it.
your mysterious caller
no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.
but just looking at the facts
and you're standing right on top of it.
it needs people who are willing to do exactly what you did today.
well, well, well.
I'm going to save you a lot of time and money, okay?
okay, about the helping. Right idea, wrong execution.
now, tell me the true identity of the blur,
maybe coming clean isn't the best idea, either.
I don't mind the bump in your geek factor.
he couldn't lie his way out of a speeding ticket.
but you do need to be more careful.
district attorney Ray Sacks, my pet research project.
was none other than Metropolis' famous blur.
and take responsibility for mistakes he's made.
pay no attention to the blonde behind the curtain.
not that it's any of your business.
Oh, the safety of this city is always my business, young lady.
every trace of your virtual existence will be obliterated.
how'd you pull off the whole blur-impersonation thing?
and you're sure he didn't try to call you and explain himself?
ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas to me.
didn't you say that the last time you opened up to someone
a true hero would not hide.
honey, when the blur decided not to come forward,
okay, well, they're as real as you and me right now.
and despite some flashes of some serious nc-17 violence,
grab your camera!
now, because of the damage he has caused this city,
we know we made some mistakes.
you know, sometimes I do feel that Clark is hiding something.
right now, Clark has this really big decision to make.
these ladies and I have a date with destiny.
after what I saw on the nightly news...
I've looked into the blur's heart,
I actually had another headline in mind.
the blur murders Lois Lane.
because you just announced in front of millions of people
it's perfectly natural, Lois, to project the heroics
if you're out there, blur...come.
and agree to work hand-in-hand with our law enforcement.
that you're the only person who knows his true identity.
let the blur be the hero he needs to be.
the D. A. says that a true hero would come forward.
at that time, I will ask the blur to show himself
whatever makes you feel more comfortable, Lois.
is to steer clear of all this political hoopla
in breaking news, Metropolis' D. A. has called out the blur.
No!
firewall Disabled.
do you still have it?
keep out
Clark!
happy?
way to go!
traitor!
Tess.
there. Virus Initialized.
welcome back, Clark.
you will.
Yeah.
host Engaged
Chloe?
aliens?
and what are you?
phone
Where's the orb?
Chloe!
and I'm pretty sure this is a bad dream,
you?
I did it for you.
Chloe!
I had to stop him.
you almost didn't.
Clark, can you hear me?
why are you risking your own life?
only a human - Pause it.
she should be fine.
Lois, where is the orb?
you...
someone moved her,
how's Lois?
what orb?!
my dad's a general, too.
the legion ring?
what?
but going up against Zod will only
excuse me?
it's hers.
Clark!
and you'll save all of us.
I didn't.
the future.
What'd you do to her?
except, of course,
just a few minutes,
not arthritis.
Smallville?
Clark.
we don't have to.
what do you mean "dream"?
Clark, if this isn't a dream,
let her go.
No!
I mean us.
Emil.
months?
is beyond me,
you want food?
you just want to take over the world with some alien nation.
if she travels back in time,
and then suddenly appeared,
long time, no see.
that way, he doesn't have a chance
for taking on this Zod guy?
that would be too dangerous.
look around you.
it's too late. Lois is already missing.
I think I know where she was.
Clark!
but you're not dreaming.
his name is Zod.
is because I'd hoped he'd join us
spying on Lois' computers
Oliver.
it's a meteor-rock knife.
so, I guess I did okay, right?
Clark.
not in these heels.
you win.
Zod would like to see you
the last firewall's down.
excuse me?
there's nothing in her chart.
Clark...
you have to. Now.
no.
because it's the only chance I have
now, if I can befriend him,
here. This is for you.
I'm sorry,
you time-traveled here?
before you destroy our world.
so...
Oh, cowboy!
what is this?
that would be a mistake.
you guys bring back the yellow sun,
she's remembering something.
fought a flying alien,
she's my cousin, Clark.
no, I won't leave her.
Heya, legs.
Chloe!
so, about the tower?
more like another planet.
I'll cover you.
if you give me the names
when my father said "save Zod,"
he won't come around.
it always was.
don't close the curtain yet.
and why would you give away the one
use the device to wipe them out.
Tess, if I make a mistake,
but I'm here now.
what, you think these are repressed memories
she could come out of this catatonic.
to take the sunshine off our shoulders.
well, I vote we take Zod out right now.
the only reason Clark is still alive
Chloe, look at me!
Oh?
no.
Clark!
a lot of people died.
to think...
Yeah.
I'm eating a maple doughnut.
Zod!
it was only a matter of time
I can't believe you're alive.
he has come.
it's all I have.
you sure seem happy.
risk what needed to be done.
we need to get the ring back.
I had to take it.
I just have one more question.
how hard can this be?
those satellites take the radiation,
take this.
not under a red sun.
it's tragic.
time for food.
but I can use the computers
maybe.
you need to take it slow.
Uh...no. Alarm.
Tess, where are you?
and when I got back, she was gone.
in the not-so-distant future.
Chloe!
can you hear me, Clark?
very.
how does turning the sun yellow
that Tess hacked into.
Kandorians are coming. We should go.
I stepped out to see if you called,
force him to come back with everything he has.
let me try something.
make sure this future never happens,
Lois.
I'm not sure what you saw in there,
I effectively reset those synapses.
go. I'll be right behind you.
it's not my band.
that she's already been through?
you're bleeding.
she won't remember.
did you really need to escalate
it's my favorite.
Clark!
but right now, I could eat about 30 maple doughnuts.
the ambulance will be here soon.
Clark.
you okay?
then Lois can return to the past
I couldn't give up on that.
and you...
I powered down watchtower
how's Clark?
and they beam it back down to earth, - You've been with her all night, Clark. - I was.
no.
doesn't mean we have to stop fighting Zod.
honey, I'm home.
Hello?!
we may have won the battle,
come on! You can make it!
from the look on your face,
Clark, I may not have been sharing
hospital said someone called
we could all die tomorrow.
the blur is dead.
but another begins.
and I told you Lois doesn't have that kind of time.
to hack into Zod's big red flashlight
Emil, if you pull Clark out now,
which is why...
look, I'm sorry, Tess, but her mind
it must have brought you here when you put it on.
take the ring, put it on.
now I think you're hiding Lois.
he wouldn't.
Clark's heading to the tower.
Chloe.
show him how good life can be here
I'm gonna pull her out, Tess.
take my life! Let her live!
your bravery is commendable.
into kidnapping her from a coma ward ?
I thought I could stop Zod myself.
and hacking into her therapist files.
the only thing I'm resisting
I have a guy on the inside.
but who could forget five dozen roses?
and what do you have to trade?
you have destroyed our world.
Clark. Thank god.
my cousin Lois vanished for three weeks
that Lois vanished for three weeks.
then you hear this.
the truth is...
these aliens have their own leader.
get the hell away from her.
then let's do it right.
Clark's literally locked into Lois' memories.
there's too much Kryptonite.
when she vanished for three weeks.
and then I grabbed that gold ring.
then it's time we take a stand.
her heart can only take so much.
then the lives we know will cease to exist.
okay, well, you better pop some popcorn.
protect the ring.
Stuart went rogue. He took her.
okay.
somehow this machine synced their brainwaves.
I thought I'd lost you forever.
I turned my back on her.
they've made you weak.
and we both know how obsessed she's been with the fact
this dream just got 10 times brighter.
I helped general Zod take power
incoming Call Chole
Lois!
Chloe, I have to find her.
and this is my chance to solve it.
by injecting her with a chemical inhibitor,
you did your job, Mensa boy. Now finish it.
my deep, dark secrets with you lately,
it's not her fault.
you're gonna be fine! You're gonna be okay!
okay, Chloe, remember when we were 10
you.
I am trying to save the world.
I still don't trust you.
there will be ice cream and chalupas,
I think it's possible.
to ensure this earth's survival.
you really want to put their lives in danger?
what the hell?
trust me, Zod.
I'm sorry, too.
all to save a doomed race.
come on. Let's go.
I was able to isolate the area of her cortex
Dr. Emil ran every possible test on her,
but we are stable again.
Lois, I don't know.
and I'll take the others to find the legion ring.
I've encased it in lead
Lois did go to the future.
when that assassin from the future came back,
why would Emil care about Lois?
no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
and trained myself to fight Zod.
before the resistance got to him.
host Engaged
I'm in the Zod tower's command center.
okay, then, look.
and I know that you had Emil look into her records.
thing of your dad's that meant so much to you?
all I did was turn him into a more powerful enemy.
is like a mental mosh pit right now, okay?
I'm general Zod.
let's just slow it down.
Clark, just because you learned a lesson in teamwork
Clark.
between life and death for your kind.
she'll be up in a few minutes with a headache,
you thought you could take me on like this.
in that case...
I feel stronger when you're around, anyway.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again.
look, I really don't get why the two of you are grinning,
no. In the future that I saw, I tried to fight Zod.
what do you mean she's missing? You took her to the hospital.
you already left us once to fight on your own.
the virus is almost ready.
this will do... for now.
Where's Lois?
break into the zone, you'll never...
Clark would never in a million years
try the truffle.
she told Clark that he would destroy the world.
don't argue with me, Stuart.
then it's the worst nightmare I could ever imagine.
Tess is never gonna admit that she took Lois.
to get Clark to see the good that we're doing.
stop beating yourself up.
so her memories from the future are gone, right?
I made all the wrong choices.
no.
this zone is off limits to your kind.
there's no releases, and there are no witnesses.
there's a mystery surrounding Miss Lane.
she went on and on about some orb
the flowers that Clark sent to her hospital room,
make Clark our number-one draft pick
I haven't talked to her in months.
Chloe kills me.
Clark, before I fought Tess,
I will find the answers we are looking for,
guys, I've seen Zod's troops.
but I believe there's a way that I can pull them out.
have we been invaded by "The wizard of oz"?
Lois, I died when you left.
a few of these could mean the difference
besides, Lois was investigating Zod's orb
you know I'm your best chance of getting back that ring.
for the woman who has everything.
for the past few months.
rise, soldier.
we have a secret weapon -- watchtower.
let's go get a real cup of coffee.
you can save her!
Really?
last I heard, you dropped her at the hospital.
picnics in the park, dancing in the rain.
the towers are the key to the Kandorians' power.
Chloe, these memories are physically damaging.
is the urge to kick both your asses.
that gives him all the power in the world.
the thing is, I lost the ring.
do you know her?
Lois.
what I think he meant was save Zod from himself.
and you said you'd just build a cooler one?
take that, master control.
Yeah, well, Tess may have helped.
so the Kandorians couldn't find it,
why are you out of uniform?
they collect all the sun's radiation, turn it red,
can't you get more than just fragments?
no one has worked as hard as I have
but now I must bury you beneath it.
I tried to fight him, but...
Lois, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this,
okay, hold on.
I had the shot.
let's take our time.
you are not alone in this.
but you never gave humanity a chance.
we are seriously outnumbered. We'd never reach it.
why Clark decided to take on our enemy E. T.s by himself
okay? I won't do it. I won't.
at all costs!
but someone else has been playing hide-and-seek
you find your way into city hall.
look, I-I didn't build this technology, okay?
or I will die in the quest!
I guess we owe you guys our lives.
I understand you've been looking for me.
we can work on your apology later.
I took a peek into Lois' therapy files
Zod and I have history.
you forced me to unleash my power!
right accusation, wrong girl.
where her synapses were firing at an accelerated rate.
and he still couldn't get me to spill
well, then...
one thing I can't believe...
Clark, if Zod gets his solar towers online,
maybe because I dropped out of girl scouts years ago.
this invasion -- Tess knew about it.
that one-named wonder, Zod, took it.
and she's healthy and doesn't remember a thing.
and you're...kind of invading my personal space.
but it's nothing that a couple of aspirin can't handle.
Lois, what are we doing?
so, what -- all this because she told a shrink
and then beam it back up to the Luthorcorp satellites.
please tell me Chloe wasn't one of them.
since when did the Kent family farm become a prison?
those crazy space invaders almost killed us.
but come on. Aren't we all in this together?
my brother and sister Kandorians...
but someone had to save the earth.
and unleash a virus that should shut it off remotely.
no matter how many times you resistance fighters
what did you see, Clark?
if she had them while under the influence of the machine,
and requested a copy of Lois' test results.
it is not your place to ask questions.
so, what, you think you two can just hug it out?
we'll never stop fighting, Zod.
five dozen roses. That's subtle.
they're called boundaries, Stuart. Find some.
I think that every time that she saw her therapist,
I left...
Lois and Clark, Clark and Lois, as a couple.
what did you mean about having a history with him?
Lois, you vanished a year ago.
with your three weeks of blocked memory?
but syncing your brainwaves to hers?
giving those alien s.o.b. s all their superhuman strength.
but Zod will come back harder now.
I wish we had more time.
don't start what you can't finish.
what if I never see you again?
this technology will tell us.
I'm pretty sure I didn't walk a whole year into the future
and if Clark were here right now, he would back me up.
I know. I did this to myself.
but I think we've fooled ourselves long enough.
the best way to avenge her death is to get that ring.
I can't believe you and Chloe aren't friends anymore.
explain about the wicked witch and the flying freaks.
I didn't do this to you.
and I'm sure that Mercer "the merciless" will be fine.
I guess membership has its privileges.
I'm here now.
well, I guess that's a start.
I got three of the country's best neuro mds on their way.
I don't want Lois waking up with the memories that I just saw.
now, he has to know how to stop it.
define "okay."
that's not a bad plan, Clark, but why should I trust you now?
take heart, Lois.
the red-blue blur -- He'll stop you.
you chose to fight me.
doc says as long as I eat every three hours, I'm gold.
you better get going.
but by defying me, you have forced my hand.
okay, ladies, we're a little touch-and-go here right now,
metropolis would not be destroyed
you redheaded rat!
Chloe, you've been hiding things from me for months.
you know, for a guy who just got a mondo case of Kryptonite,
considering the fact that we're all about to die terribly tragic deaths
you guys shut down that tower and bring back the yellow sun,
she has headaches and sees weird futuristic flashes?
I'm a reporter. Asking questions is in my blood.
to anyone who would dare defy me.
but out here, you were still alive.
Lois can't answer any of her questions. She's in a coma.
no, I was just throwing down with Tess a few hours ago.
it will put a lot of other people's lives at stake.
so I'm definitely not telling you anything.
she used to work for me. But then she disappeared.
it reminded me of you, and that hurt too much.
and I kicked you out of my clubhouse for spilling soda
claiming that she was being chased by a ninja-clad assassin.
it would be a shame to spill it.
but this dream is all mine, so what's with the attitude?
she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.
you abandoned us, big guy, plain and simple.
after I thought I lost you, I went off on my own.
I'm sending Lois home to the past.
a lot longer than I have.
you always were a good shot.
today, two lives end...
that's Zod's solar tower...
never take down my tower.
Stuart's lost a lot of blood, but luckily he's still alive.
you know, I still need to get my feet back under me.
this time, I'm gonna do things the right way.
what? I can't hack into these files and not read them.
let's just say that I made some mistakes.
we could have made this planet a paradise!
maybe the person he's working for would.
and prevent Zod's tower from being built in the first place.
I wanted you to join me on this new earth.
a double execution will send out a strong message
humanity will never lose its spirit.
and maybe you think he abandoned the cause or something.
of whoever snuck you into the restricted zone.
and then we'll have lunch -- the first of many.
Emil gave me the hospital workups on her.
you're nothing but a filthy human.
Zod will fly psychopathic circles around you.
I give you the world's first solar tower.
what orb? - The alien technology from my board.
to bridge the gap between our people.
and you will take me to a Monster-Truck rally.
how I got an m1 Abrams tank to take me to prom.
I am this planet's savior!
it actually unlocked more of her memories from the future.
you just got back from a trip to the hospital, not Hawaii.
I'll scout ahead and make sure the coast is clear.
I have hypoglycemia, Clark.
she doesn't have to talk to Tess for her to run tests on her.
could these vivid dreams you've been having have something to do
okay, easy. I was just hoping for some food here.
all we're seeing on the screen are jumbled images.
goodbye, son of Jor-El.
I almost lost you once. I don't want it to happen again.
I tried to take him on as my enemy, and I was wrong.
well, the sun is shining, Lois is gonna be all right.
and almost got my head chopped off.
and you should have a front-row seat to the Lois matinee.
so far today, I've traveled through time,
even in the future, you still know how to charm a girl.
you get Dr. Weiss on a helicopter and get him to Met Gen now.
stealing will not go unpunished.
I understand you were seen talking to Clark Kent.
smooth over any laws that might get in our way.
okay, Tess, tuning the TV to channel Lois is one thing,
when faced with a crumbling world, these humans,
you move it. I said move.
you just went from 10 to, like, 110 in 2 seconds flat.
you think this has something to do with her trip to the future.
at least you can enjoy a glorious last meal.
I take it the future isn't so bright.
well, you can lean on me for strength.
why don't we have the powers we should have under yellow sun?
she's still alive in the past, Lois.
Chloe, I've seen what happens when I treat Zod like the enemy.
it's yours if you let her go.
Lois vanished a year ago after she put on the legion ring.
but we are literally messing with someone's mind here.
I should have guessed you'd come after me.
they'd rather die than unite under a single leader
we should see our yellow sun rise and shine again.
to get the answers I'm looking for, I need to plug in.
so the enemy won't know you're packing till it's too late.
exactly as it's designed to be built.
but the plans haven't even gone public yet.
so every time she has a memory, her body relives the trauma.
your reign of terror is over, Zod.
and us none, including you.
don't you think we should have someone from summerholt here?
Tess Mercer, the ultimate ecoterrorist.
now, we take the tower down, we take them down.
that's why we need every hero we can get.
called it alien technology, said there was life inside of it.
Kneel...Before Kal-El.
and all of this is mine to give...
Tess has been keeping more than just an editorial eye on Lois
and am I glad to see you and your band of merrymen.
I couldn't be around Oliver or Chloe.
that's because if we do something in the present, we can change all that.
she can warn us about your tower before it's ever built.
but despite all those things...
so, this is what happens when there's no blur.
this tower must be built
you betrayed the entire human race for some crappy dog tags.
neither of you is any good to me alive.
if you had all just stopped fighting and joined me.
Lois, after you disappeared, I couldn't...
and these futuristic flashes may not be imaginary.
and do what's required to build a glorious new world.
Lois?
No!
firewall Disabled.
do you still have it?
keep out
Clark!
happy?
way to go!
traitor!
Tess.
there. Virus Initialized.
welcome back, Clark.
you will.
Yeah.

Chloe?
aliens?
and what are you?
phone
Where's the orb?
Chloe!
and I'm pretty sure this is a bad dream,
you?
I did it for you.
Chloe!
I had to stop him.
you almost didn't.
Clark, can you hear me?
why are you risking your own life?
only a human - Pause it.
she should be fine.
Lois, where is the orb?
you...
someone moved her,
how's Lois?
what orb?!
my dad's a general, too.
the legion ring?
what?

excuse me?
it's hers.

I feel stronger when you're around, anyway.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again.
look, I really don't get why the two of you are grinning,
no. In the future that I saw, I tried to fight Zod.
what do you mean she's missing? You took her to the hospital.
you already left us once to fight on your own.
the virus is almost ready.
this will do... for now.
Where's Lois?
break into the zone, you'll never...
Clark would never in a million years
try the truffle.
she told Clark that he would destroy the world.
don't argue with me, Stuart.
then it's the worst nightmare I could ever imagine.
Tess is never gonna admit that she took Lois.
to get Clark to see the good that we're doing.
stop beating yourself up.
so her memories from the future are gone, right?
I made all the wrong choices.
no.
this zone is off limits to your kind.
there's no releases, and there are no witnesses.
there's a mystery surrounding Miss Lane.
she went on and on about some orb
the flowers that Clark sent to her hospital room,
make Clark our number-one draft pick
I haven't talked to her in months.
Chloe kills me.
Clark, before I fought Tess,
I will find the answers we are looking for,
guys, I've seen Zod's troops.
but I believe there's a way that I can pull them out.
have we been invaded by "The wizard of oz"?
Lois, I died when you left.
a few of these could mean the difference
besides, Lois was investigating Zod's orb
you know I'm your best chance of getting back that ring.
for the woman who has everything.
for the past few months.
rise, soldier.
we have a secret weapon -- watchtower.
let's go get a real cup of coffee.
you can save her!
Really?
last I heard, you dropped her at the hospital.
picnics in the park, dancing in the rain.
the towers are the key to the Kandorians' power.
Chloe, these memories are physically damaging.
is the urge to kick both your asses.
that gives him all the power in the world.
the thing is, I lost the ring.
do you know her?
Lois.
what I think he meant was save Zod from himself.
and you said you'd just build a cooler one?
take that, master control.
Yeah, well, Tess may have helped.
so the Kandorians couldn't find it,
why are you out of uniform?
they collect all the sun's radiation, turn it red,
can't you get more than just fragments?
no one has worked as hard as I have
but now I must bury you beneath it.
I tried to fight him, but...
Lois, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this,
okay, hold on.
I had the shot.
let's take our time.
you are not alone in this.
but you never gave humanity a chance.
we are seriously outnumbered. We'd never reach it.
why Clark decided to take on our enemy E. T.s by himself
okay? I won't do it. I won't.
at all costs!
but someone else has been playing hide-and-seek
you find your way into city hall.
look, I-I didn't build this technology, okay?
or I will die in the quest!
I guess we owe you guys our lives.
I understand you've been looking for me.
we can work on your apology later.
I took a peek into Lois' therapy files
Zod and I have history.
you forced me to unleash my power!
right accusation, wrong girl.
where her synapses were firing at an accelerated rate.
and he still couldn't get me to spill
well, then...
one thing I can't believe...
Clark, if Zod gets his solar towers online,
maybe because I dropped out of girl scouts years ago.
this invasion -- Tess knew about it.
that one-named wonder, Zod, took it.
and she's healthy and doesn't remember a thing.
and you're...kind of invading my personal space.
but it's nothing that a couple of aspirin can't handle.
Lois, what are we doing?
so, what -- all this because she told a shrink
and then beam it back up to the Luthorcorp satellites.
please tell me Chloe wasn't one of them.
since when did the Kent family farm become a prison?
those crazy space invaders almost killed us.
but come on. Aren't we all in this together?
my brother and sister Kandorians...
but someone had to save the earth.
and unleash a virus that should shut it off remotely.
no matter how many times you resistance fighters
what did you see, Clark?
if she had them while under the influence of the machine,
and requested a copy of Lois' test results.
it is not your place to ask questions.
so, what, you think you two can just hug it out?
we'll never stop fighting, Zod.
five dozen roses. That's subtle.
they're called boundaries, Stuart. Find some.
I think that every time that she saw her therapist,
I left...
Lois and Clark, Clark and Lois, as a couple.
what did you mean about having a history with him?
Lois, you vanished a year ago.
with your three weeks of blocked memory?
but syncing your brainwaves to hers?
giving those alien s.o.b. s all their superhuman strength.
but Zod will come back harder now.
I wish we had more time.
don't start what you can't finish.
what if I never see you again?
this technology will tell us.
I'm pretty sure I didn't walk a whole year into the future
and if Clark were here right now, he would back me up.
I know. I did this to myself.
but I think we've fooled ourselves long enough.
the best way to avenge her death is to get that ring.
I can't believe you and Chloe aren't friends anymore.
explain about the wicked witch and the flying freaks.
I didn't do this to you.
and I'm sure that Mercer "the merciless" will be fine.
I guess membership has its privileges.
I'm here now.
well, I guess that's a start.
I got three of the country's best neuro mds on their way.
I don't want Lois waking up with the memories that I just saw.
now, he has to know how to stop it.
define "okay."
that's not a bad plan, Clark, but why should I trust you now?
take heart, Lois.
the red-blue blur -- He'll stop you.
you chose to fight me.
doc says as long as I eat every three hours, I'm gold.
you better get going.
but by defying me, you have forced my hand.
okay, ladies, we're a little touch-and-go here right now,
metropolis would not be destroyed
you redheaded rat!
Chloe, you've been hiding things from me for months.
you know, for a guy who just got a mondo case of Kryptonite,
considering the fact that we're all about to die terribly tragic deaths
you guys shut down that tower and bring back the yellow sun,
she has headaches and sees weird futuristic flashes?
I'm a reporter. Asking questions is in my blood.
to anyone who would dare defy me.
but out here, you were still alive.
Lois can't answer any of her questions. She's in a coma.
no, I was just throwing down with Tess a few hours ago.
it will put a lot of other people's lives at stake.
so I'm definitely not telling you anything.
she used to work for me. But then she disappeared.
it reminded me of you, and that hurt too much.
and I kicked you out of my clubhouse for spilling soda
claiming that she was being chased by a ninja-clad assassin.
it would be a shame to spill it.
but this dream is all mine, so what's with the attitude?
she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.
you abandoned us, big guy, plain and simple.
after I thought I lost you, I went off on my own.
I'm sending Lois home to the past.
a lot longer than I have.
you always were a good shot.
today, two lives end...
that's Zod's solar tower...
never take down my tower.
Stuart's lost a lot of blood, but luckily he's still alive.
you know, I still need to get my feet back under me.
this time, I'm gonna do things the right way.
what? I can't hack into these files and not read them.
let's just say that I made some mistakes.
we could have made this planet a paradise!
maybe the person he's working for would.
and prevent Zod's tower from being built in the first place.
I wanted you to join me on this new earth.
a double execution will send out a strong message
humanity will never lose its spirit.
and maybe you think he abandoned the cause or something.
of whoever snuck you into the restricted zone.
and then we'll have lunch -- the first of many.
Emil gave me the hospital workups on her.
you're nothing but a filthy human.
Zod will fly psychopathic circles around you.
I give you the world's first solar tower.
what orb? - The alien technology from my board.
to bridge the gap between our people.
and you will take me to a Monster-Truck rally.
how I got an m1 Abrams tank to take me to prom.
I am this planet's savior!
it actually unlocked more of her memories from the future.
you just got back from a trip to the hospital, not Hawaii.
I'll scout ahead and make sure the coast is clear.
I have hypoglycemia, Clark.
she doesn't have to talk to Tess for her to run tests on her.
could these vivid dreams you've been having have something to do
okay, easy. I was just hoping for some food here.
all we're seeing on the screen are jumbled images.
goodbye, son of Jor-El.
I almost lost you once. I don't want it to happen again.
I tried to take him on as my enemy, and I was wrong.
well, the sun is shining, Lois is gonna be all right.
and almost got my head chopped off.
and you should have a front-row seat to the Lois matinee.
so far today, I've traveled through time,
even in the future, you still know how to charm a girl.
you get Dr. Weiss on a helicopter and get him to Met Gen now.
stealing will not go unpunished.
I understand you were seen talking to Clark Kent.
smooth over any laws that might get in our way.
okay, Tess, tuning the TV to channel Lois is one thing,
when faced with a crumbling world, these humans,
you move it. I said move.
you just went from 10 to, like, 110 in 2 seconds flat.
you think this has something to do with her trip to the future.
at least you can enjoy a glorious last meal.
I take it the future isn't so bright.
well, you can lean on me for strength.
why don't we have the powers we should have under yellow sun?
she's still alive in the past, Lois.
Chloe, I've seen what happens when I treat Zod like the enemy.
it's yours if you let her go.
Lois vanished a year ago after she put on the legion ring.
but we are literally messing with someone's mind here.
I should have guessed you'd come after me.
they'd rather die than unite under a single leader
we should see our yellow sun rise and shine again.
to get the answers I'm looking for, I need to plug in.
so the enemy won't know you're packing till it's too late.
exactly as it's designed to be built.
but the plans haven't even gone public yet.
so every time she has a memory, her body relives the trauma.
your reign of terror is over, Zod.
and us none, including you.
don't you think we should have someone from summerholt here?
Tess Mercer, the ultimate ecoterrorist.
now, we take the tower down, we take them down.
that's why we need every hero we can get.
called it alien technology, said there was life inside of it.
Kneel...Before Kal-El.
and all of this is mine to give...
Tess has been keeping more than just an editorial eye on Lois
and am I glad to see you and your band of merrymen.
I couldn't be around Oliver or Chloe.
that's because if we do something in the present, we can change all that.
she can warn us about your tower before it's ever built.
but despite all those things...
so, this is what happens when there's no blur.
this tower must be built
you betrayed the entire human race for some crappy dog tags.
neither of you is any good to me alive.
if you had all just stopped fighting and joined me.
Lois, after you disappeared, I couldn't...
and these futuristic flashes may not be imaginary.
and do what's required to build a glorious new world.
Lois?
bingo.
no.
everything's encrypted.
we can't repay you.
okay. Look, you know what?
fat.
in the coming days,
giving them theirs.
Alia?
brace yourself.
I can't.
it was Alia.
right.
all right, Mr. Cold Feet.
Emil?
ah -- no.
no, thank you. She doesn't really
let's get you some water.
as long as I've known you,
you did what?
a total union violation.
just like the blur?
you've gone too far,
right?
I just -- I had hoped
where are you going?
no.
it's Chloe.
like she's supposed to.
how's your pot roast?
Lois, did something happen?
sorry about the heels.
well, I guess it's easier
if by that you mean isn't fooling anyone.
she's not 6 years old.
lane?
Faora.
of all of watchtower's systems.
tell me who killed my father.
Yeah.
Clark.
sounds mighty traditional.
alia.
I don't.
she's gone.
there was a miscommunication.
are you all right? What's the emergency?
they are definitely hiding something.
all we need is a chaperone.
that job is your life.
but then I can't un-do it.
that you're not telling me?
great.
right.
it's Valentine's Day.
this is serious.
welcome home.
Lois.
look, I know it sounds crazy,
I need a brew.
when the first rays of the sun
lane.
I'll save your world.
this job's way too stressful.
the tower is ready.
no.
Oh, you know what?
Yeah, but it wasn't
for richer or for poorer.
she's been really sweet.
excuse me.
it's never too early for nachos,
they're gonna print a retraction.
Kal-El.
I'll handle that, thank you.
security!
Where'd you get it?
she kind of got sick.
we need to talk.
I tortured him.
are you sure?
do you know where Chloe is?
use it or lose it, Kent.
I'm sorry to hear that, Emil,
we found another way.
do you mean it?
forever?
we can have you move back to the Talon
look, I-I'm sorry that you're, uh,
I thought maybe sometimes...
I do.
you'll never crack my system.
Yeah, we should talk.
cause you seem kind of...
I know.
go ahead.
than it is to give it a shot.
collect on what?
Yeah.
I know that you're saying that
wrong choice of bedfellows.
right.
Yeah, well, I know it seems like
whatevs.
would you trust me with it?
you were protecting him.
when you were secretly talking to him having a hard time with this, Chloe, that filters the radiation.
Oh, yeah. That's right.
he doesn't take them, Tess.
move over, Betty Crocker.
people are pathetic.
because sometimes protecting you
I'm retracing her steps.
why didn't you let me kill her?
Clark, I don't
I realize you're not on board
Donna reed on crack.
to be of some use.
come on!
two days.
but I'm just afraid that my big mouth tells me it didn't go over so well.
Lois, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry, with me helping the Kandorians.
sure, I'll tell her.
uh, yeah.
until we get engaged.
it is just a little sad that the only way
Tess Mercer.
I never planned for it to happen that way.
I'll keep the home fires burning.
but the day has finally come.
she was one of the zealots
normally, kryptonite only affects me,
Clark, I'm a big girl.
for some reason, Chloe has shut me out
thanks so much!
thanks...
because you want to protect people, sweet on the outside and empty in the middle,
I'm not sure this is such a good idea.
to complain about Valentine's Day
you're digging your own grave.
Lois?
I want...
Clark, it's good you're here.
are lagging behind schedule.
God knows I spilled my guts.
Hey, Chloe.
but I have my own fires to put out.
you have always had to have the scoop, so they can save your doomed planet?
he's the promise for their future.
look, either R. A.O. Incorporated
I need to figure out a way to reverse this.
is gonna wreck our relationship one day.
I need the inches.
means protecting you from yourself.
what if I miss the old Lois?
should have aimed a little higher.
but that's not the point.
no, she's not my...
here's the scoop, buddy.
the whole making-a-home thing.
how'd she die?
okay. Let's open a window.
no, they won't.
Yeah, Mom, about the engagement
no, the love train has jumped the tracks.
Lois, what's going on?
you know what happens.
you killed him?
I moved in!
I don't know what she put in that stuff.
she was the only one who knew where he was.
the tower will be completed in two days.
help give my people their powers
I moved in.
that's pretty much exactly how I feel right now.
just not with you in it.
that you were talking about.
only I can run them.
why did you call me here?
Lois, you can't quit reporting.
no matter what it takes.
with that lemony-fresh scent.
Thanks, Chloe. You're a life-saver.
I don't know what I was thinking.
okay, you know what?
on dead flowers and overpriced meals...
you are always gonna be a second-stringer.
by my hand.
Clark is a very private person,
you don't need to stop.
engineered by corporate executives
just try to relax for once.
she was the only one who could finish the job.
not other people.
anything for your career, sweetie.
do you have the passports and I. D. cards ready?
I like you just where you are.
Hey, sweetie pie!
hack yourself silly.
I may have overlooked some of their mistakes.
too late.
all the materials you would ever need but something about you being here with me
you just seem so cheerful, I...
Oh, good! - All right! Thank you!
meteor rock.
and block the source of my power,
you sound like you want it all to yourself.
I am so relieved to hear you say that.
but there's something else going on here.
Oh, it's delicious.
I want to lead them to a better place.
but I confessed to the whole world
the atmosphere will turn red
don't worry, Tess.
wonderful.
is that your girlfriend?
and what's wrong with that?
so that you could lead them.
was there anything in that chocolate you sold her?
Lois, stop. You are home.
nice Teddy. Next time, buy her a silk one.
you must avenge him.
I have got this cooking thing down.
we don't use that word.
my no-conspiring-with-baddies policy.
you're absolutely right.
no, the satellites just create a shield emotional manipulation of V-day,
I didn't kill him.
of scrubbing a kitchen can do.
we need the knowledge of your people
but not you two.
you're not yourself right now.
and was he the last one to see Jor-El alive?
I thought you needed the book of Rau to finish it.
no.
did you kill Jor-El?
I ate two boxes and gained three pounds.
there's blood on your hands
Clark?
maybe I just need to trust
and about the whole proposal
I had to kill one of my own soldiers...
you'll have your own identities.
you killed her?
you're right.
mistakes? By "mistakes" do you mean them building a tower
rain check on talking about the big event for now.
Kal-El.
but I have lost my faith in Zod.
to show mercy to this planet.
mom.
you've seen the future, Tess.
but when it comes to understanding the real Clark, and all packed up before the sun's up.
fairy dust. That was -- that was cute.
chez Kent has a new resident.
hand over the reins to Kal-El and then what?
I'm afraid they're otherwise engaged.
but because you were too weak to do it,
happy Valentine's Day.
when you asked me to move in with you here,
it's linked up to the satellites.
then maybe you'd like to join me.
well, she obviously had her own agenda.
if you really are one of us.
and I really meant to keep that secret.
come on! I'm not stupid.
but I know who did.
well, it is amazing what four hours
Zod has a lot of loyal followers, and you announced it to everyone on national television?
I'm gonna need the expos? Now.
that somehow I'd be able to pull it off,
I bet it's great with the ladies.
so, in the face of the candy-coated,
so, now Alia can't slay me in the future
your tower does when it goes online.
we're onlining the safety tests now.
and you were very persuasive.
wait. Is there something about that tower
about everything, right?
looks like it's too late to follow that story anyway.
I don't think the blur minds, Lois.
I promise you. I wasn't myself.
you know, Lois, I think we should drop this story.
it always ends in disaster.
you don't think I want justice?
to change the atmosphere, but come on, Clark.
kind of pathetic.
I know it seemed like a good idea at the time.
I have the papers.
and he was still willing to sacrifice his life for yours.
I think I breathed in some sort of new meteor rock.
that you had to get your hands dirty.
only you can seek retribution.
he would have destroyed us.
Oh, Mrs. K. can I really?
she's activated laser trip wires around the system core.
that you can get close to Clark right now is to play mother hen.
she hit the target head-on.
and it's never too late for hard-hitting journalism.
it simply sparkles.
once Clark knows you, who runs away the second anything goes wrong.
they're open to suggestion.
you were doing the right thing.
okay, I love you, too, mom.
for better or for worse,
you sold my friend and I some candies the other night.
how is that possible?
and I can't believe you actually managed
Lois, maybe we should put our relationship before our work,
you find out that one of them skewers you to death
Clark knows that he can trust me.
you know, Lois, there's something at the office
you could come A-courtin' on your horse and buggy.
you knew when you started on this path
I thought it represented hope for all of us, just like when you did when you sent me to see Tess!
engaged?
well, now that I've got your fingerprints,
Emil, look, I want you to calm down.
Yeah, I -- I don't know what it is, to help us reverse the damage we've done here,
I've seen Clark in love before, and it always holds him back.
and you won't even defend his honor.
you revealed your powers.
and if they're skulking around in the middle of the night,
you neglected to tell me
Cheers.
what kind of adjective is "poorer"?
you have to believe me.
and it seems your satellite systems to escape your life and start a new one.
but they don't see you as the savior that he is.
well, Chloe can be overprotective sometimes.
to convince people to spend hard-earned money
and then you will have to decide
get rid of me?
the least I can do is cook it up in a pan.
it's like you and Lois are doing whatever I say,
goodbye, smallville.
it's your new life.
do you have any idea what she's talking about?
I...
just for tonight and... - Hold hands?
if necessary.
you're trying to isolate me from my people.
you were the son he never met,
I quit.
the real you underneath all of this Lois armor,
if you really love him, but this love train has left the station.
but embracing the red skies definitely violates
you were with the bitter chick.
I am not good for you, Clark!
Nope. It's Greek to me.
I think you may have gotten a contact high
which is why you have to join the Kandorians
I'm not gonna kill Tess.
it's the kryptonian way.
I'm only getting married once.
and if you go after him, there will be war.
my father was murdered, and I'm here to collect.
I don't know the first thing
there are no backsies in this lifetime.
Clark will just love it.
it was a dream-come-true level of "wow,
speaking of Greece, your dad left a message.
I did it in the name of Rau.
who thought he would find a way to destroy us.
I've done everything in my power to postpone this, fall upon the solar towers tomorrow morning,
you wanted to avoid the whole Valentine's-day-thing thing, right?
or they are running double shifts on a Saturday night
it's quite the offer.
she didn't deserve to die.
I am getting married!
he was a brother to me.
he's gonna see that you're just a scared little kid
Lois, maybe I should check on those building permits
I know that Zod took him from Tess.
I misjudged you, Kal-El.
in any romantic way at all,
okay, I have breaking news.
if Clark joins them,
drum roll, please.
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
you don't think I want revenge?!
we should be out having dinner together, by candlelight.
well, maybe...
you cannot let this injustice stand.
I want you to go back to the way you were.
Yeah, well, you know how it is.
he died protecting you,
I can access all of the networking data without you.
in the post-apocalyptic future, you kind of lose interest.
for always and forever.
how do I stop putting people into hypnotic trances?
why would I make time for you?
I can't believe he piggybacks my cameras.
we just have to continue being honest with each other.
not this.
but right now, I want you to focus on watching my back.
or we could get right down to business.
there's got to be something out there that you're after. Huh?
she left 12 messages apologizing for what she said
you know I haven't told anyone your secret.
I promise things will look better in the morning.
something is going on.
it was really sweet of you to do all of this.
so they can give themselves powers to take over the world?
you know, this whole Martha Stewart-makeover thing
and why is your vinyl collection here?
but you and I have to work together.
you better make an honest woman out of me, Clark Kent.
granted, they haven't got the satellites up and running
with all of our crossed text messages lately,
you don't think sometimes I want to be a killer like you?
this isn't my kind of justice.
maybe you just need to chill.
and defeat Zod so he doesn't take your powers away.
I'm moments away from completing my tower.
you confided in me, Clark.
but it comes from some quarry in Smallville.
this whole moving-in thing together was a joke.
it hurts me to be around you.
I...quit my job at the planet.
I beat him black and blue.
she confessed she murdered your father.
sounds kind of like hypnosis to me.
justice must be served.
Clark, Valentine's Day is just a smarmy hallmark holiday that I was talking to the blur on national television,
Lois, you can't leave. Not yet.
look, maybe it would just be safer
I was gonna ask you for the lowdown on your V-day with Lois,
I found it in the back of your closet.
let me think about it.
I never had a choice to live as a civilian.
you lost your right to lead when you killed my father.
you're tainted -- a reminder of their past.
there's firewalls around firewalls around firewalls.
it's too bad. I kind of liked your outfit.
it's not gonna be that easy to get rid of me.
but there's only one way to be sure.
us to have a more traditional relationship.
and the Kandorians will have their powers.
Lois, I'm sure someone is keeping an eye on this situation.
and now my life is with you,
this is the digital equivalent to the Ebola virus.
that what we have is something more.
nothing can compromise that.
when she can be at home taking care of her man.
I-I just need to make a few phone calls here.
we both know one of them killed your father.
leave the rest of the planet to me.
come on, dad. Can't we just hitch a carrier to Greece?
that I need to... investigate.
Clark, if you had a really big secret...
and when I gain my own powers...
easy with the pixie dust there, tinker bell.
to get justice for you.
justice, vengeance.
you really are an old-fashioned romantic, aren't you?
never let you forget that you're the man.
about family time or dinners at home.
there is one thing!
you will see there is only one kind of justice.
Lois, you -- you need to sleep on this.
if you were really under a command to protect me,
I was born into the military.
Zod took matters into his own hands.
and when the chips are down, everyone can see your cards.
it just depends whose side you're on.
guess we can move my stuff out of the guest room now.
