what peddlers?
No!
this is not the way.
Mm. That one.
Miranda.
Zedd.
as you wish.
Zedd?
does that help us?
he's a wizard!
I don't know.
jeziah.
Richard.
how did you--?
I don't understand.
try not to move.
rymus wouldn't have helped us,
if we work together,
you could have died.
take a look around.
was I supposed to kill him?
you can save this town from the confessed.
five pence.
it was dark,
there are a lot of caves.
is it for her?
like a river or lake.
No!
stop.
Thanks. We have to be on our way.
you all right?
my lady!
I would've gone back a third time
make her like me.
have you tried talking to her?
I want to help these people,
the potion's gotten us this far,
seeker!
it kills!
if Kahlan hadn't stopped me.
back so soon?
it's this way.
there was green on the wall.
Why?
Richard, the wizard!
do you want me to kill him?
I'm not angry.
forgive me.
how do you know where we're going?
are you making these up?
as long as he's wearing this,
what will you do then?
she can make a person tell the truth,
I have something that'll make you irresistible to her.
something wrong?
it worked.
and I did.
there's only two of them.
you could confess miranda.
we have to find zedd.
the old prophets' temple.
well, what?
here.
he thought he was protecting me.
it can help us the rest of the way.
maybe?
I can't thank you enough.
he couldn't have been any older than 16.
I saw her do it back in hartland.
I-I don't know what to say.
glitter moss.
I used it twice.
what are you doing?
a girl.
you all right?
you told me I have this destiny to
southeast.
save the world from darken rahl,
if you take away that choice,
what did Kahlan do to him?
it's a heavy burden she carries.
I don't have them anymore.
sir.
Richard, I...
two leagues north of here.
I would've invited you for roasted that's the "confessor" part.
make certain the body is dead,
I needed them.
I don't have any money.
the quillion will absorb
gentlemen.
what are you talking about?
it's the sword of truth, isn't it?
pack everything.
with honor.
others too.
it's all right.
glitter moss.
her name's miranda.
I'm sorry, old friend.
what did you use it for?
uh, I'm sorry. Richard!
no one admits to knowing anything.
lest the head grow back.
again.
glad I could be of service.
but she won't even look at me, unless I use the potion.
it could take us days to search them.
what happened to that village, to jack.
which way?
something you've been teaching him?
I don't want to do it, either.
Miranda.
Hi.
you said the last one was number four.
no, I can't take credit for this.
how much for the horses?
I only knew about the temple.
even someone like rymus?
maybe Rymus lied to you.
Zeddicus, old friend.
they've moved?
I-- I didn't know you were there. Richard!
the midlands have changed since you disappeared, Zeddicus.
No!
he tried to kill me.
what if he wakes up?
there they are.
my compliments.
but selling magic?
I believe in you.
I'm slicing fruit for your breakfast.
Richard.
what would zedd say if he were here?
I didn't understand what was happening.
it's-- it's special.
and who are you to interfere?
you put something in my drink?
you're imagining things.
it's not for me to talk about.
excuse me.
that's all?
which way did he go?
he's riding for drundril.
that's him.
even their home.
but I can give you this.
looks like you could use it.
my friend is in a lot trouble.
I can't make you lucky,
there is.
Oh, I'm fine.
again.
the magic gives them an escape.
the seeker of truth, not of wizards.
an elixir.
maybe in a couple of days.
...like a slave.
what's the difference?
bring him to me.
what?
try now.
to be out of your sight.
Oh, my lady.
make a meal out of you.
he's gone.
you're just like him.
all to find out if anyone's lying.
I'd like to know.
echo lake isn't far.
he's traveling with the seeker.
your neighbors are just gonna have to learn
magic isn't good or bad,
No!
just something I learned in a cookbook.
and your senses?
you can do that?
true enough.
don't hurt him.
you shouldn't have let rymus go.
I don't know where to start.
it's below the waterline.
Richard, no! This is getting worse.
is there anything more I can do to please you?
why aren't they masking their trail?
but I can take you to the temple.
it is.
but where?
I was born with this power.
me?
not quite back to my old self.
you!
he left town this morning.
that's lesson number six.
did you? I have more of that potion.
maybe you should just confess them
everything I taught you.
you brought these people here!
their lives are dreary.
partridge instead of having you abducted.
but you're not, are you?
my boy.
let me show you.
I hope you had better luck than I did.
I'm warning you.
you are making these up, aren't you?
following my instincts?
I thought I did.
it's that nothing is guaranteed.
now tell me where they are.
your forehead wrinkles when you're upset.
of course.
that's an interesting pendant.
there are only a few caves there.
my friend, he's hurt.
but why Rymus come back
someone's stealing our horses! What?
there must be something I can trade.
but it doesn't have to be this way.
I was distracted.
Kahlan!
dozens of them, south of the gully.
peddlers.
you of all people have no right.
who could've stolen your horses.
you can't just sell it on the streets
but not for the two of you.
tell us where the horses are.
to anyone for a few copper coins.
I hope my men didn't hurt you.
I don't know. I've just got this feeling.
but it did work.
and take it from one who knows,
he could have no better teacher than you,
maybe this is the wrong place.
all my life,
I can't even think when I'm around her.
if there's one thing i've learned about magic,
what lesson is that? No lesson.
you're the seeker.
what about him?
take us there.
that's not possible.
lesson number four, seeker.
the horses!
I didn't buy it in a tavern.
an army of the midlands.
you should kill me.
this ain't your village.
love is a choice we make.
I think I know where to find our horse thief.
maybe you can show them how.
I could go back and get more.
now you know why she's called a "confessor."
I assumed he was working for darken rahl.
I paid rymus before you
and your mates drove him off.
this is his fault. If he hadn't delayed us...
number five, then!
maybe I shouldn't have gone back for the potion.
they become...
that magic peddler, Rymus.
it's complicated.
remember "before chopping off the head, who knows what's happening to him"?
no, no. I want what you gave me before.
I don't believe it's right to continue forcing
I don't have either!
you want it or not?
convince you to be more cooperative.
he's not in control of his feelings.
Thanks.
you what? No.
they weren't harmed.
hello again.
you know him?
it goes against everything we believe in.
Hey, stop the cart.
I'll take you to them.
one rose, please. A white one.
I left to protect the seeker!
the moss was being fed by water dripping downwards.
the kind that
what are you doing?
it's that pretty girl you were with, isn't it?
it wasn't easy to come by.
so any idea? Any idea at all?
they're moving too fast. They mustn't have time.
what? What do you mean?
the lowlands. South of the lake.
when I heard there was a wizard in the village,
he can't help it.
I guess I'm gonna have to take it out on your hide, then.
leave the boy alone.
one village is a small price to pay if we can save the rest of the Midlands.
he has a lot to learn, but...
that's not necessary. You can draw us a map.
are you all right?
I need time and money to build an army.
and you're just an old fool.
they sell magic?
maybe for them,
we want them back.
are you sure
there hasn't been a true seeker in a thousand years.
jeziah?
he could've helped us find zedd.
that found me in the end.
what are you--? No, sorry.
them to do my bidding any longer than I have to.
but on the other hand, he'd still be alive.
I've chased away the men who were threatening you.
we just want what belongs to us.
are you angry with me?
you can do this without the potion, Richard.
a pleasure doing business.
this town is filled with thieves and cheats.
according to her, it was your tracking skills but instead of looking for him,
Rahl isn't the only evil in the midlands.
I can't. The peddlers will kill me.
the men who are trying to destroy it.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
and this young man you're traveling with,
Rahl and his minions live in the shadows.
that boy I saw you with, Jack...
this is your fault. You and your friends.
if you need supplies-- oh, no.
I wouldn't have known you were in a cave.
a quillion?
all I have is one piece of steel.
she works at the flower stand.
um, this is my store.
I didn't see anything.
right under the nose of the seeker!
but-- it's not just because you're the seeker.
magic tore this town apart.
how much can you pay?
you can do this without magic, Richard.
one of those potions. - What?
but I don't have any other idea.
take us. -I only follow her orders.
to fix their problems without magic.
how much more do you need?
I know you wanna protect me 'cause I'm the seeker,
in the wrong hands, it-- it ruins lives.
no, it's for you.
that's how I found jack. It had nothing to do with me.
there's another wizard in the village.
don't be too impressed with yourself.
a highwayman makes off with our horses,
you really believe he's the true seeker?
I'm not upset, I'm-- ah.
look, we didn't come here to fight.
in love?
to become better than what the world made them.
we can't just let him go.
but you found jack.
you're guessing.
I'm prepared to die for her. Are you?
it's not really love, is it?
a girl? Yeah.
my work is too important.
the villagers have given you everything they own.
you mean the horses he traded me?
where does the magic they sell come from?
do not judge me, Zeddicus.
she made a d'haran soldier kill his comrades.
sorcerers and dark wizards are everywhere, all of your power in a matter of hours.
stay away from me.
I can see why it's such a burden for her.
farmers are not sowing their fields,
do you understand me?
take care of him. I'll be back. Where are you going?
you use magic. You confessed rymus.
we'll need our horses back.
it's one of the repercussions of Kahlan's powers.
we know where their temple is.
m-- my companions.
you're making the magic that's being peddled on the streets of drundril.
what kind of potions are these peddlers selling?
prettiest in the whole town.
some even cloak themselves in black magic.
if this is how you greet an old friend,
I could never use my power in that way, jack.
and the way he was looking at her...
Zedd?
the barmaid at the tavern slipped something in my drink.
you can't keep using these potions.
you worked for these people, you know where their cave is?
you could use it to find zedd.
It's...complicated.
but first...
no tracks. Anywhere.
couldn't say.
they're suffocating under rahl's edicts.
Kahlan, Richard has feelings for you.
it's the seeker's duty to fight them wherever he can.
tell me about her.
perhaps the gentle touch of a confessor will, uh,
we have to find him.
those teachings are from another era, old friend.
Yeah. Thanks.
to buy magic.
I see you found the boy you were looking for.
even if they're not gonna be happy about it.
but my mission is to fight darken rahl.
Richard!
we may not know what Richard's full potential is.
if Kahlan hadn't used magic to confess him.
maybe there's hope for them.
I'm sorry. I sold them to a trader.
then not even the rats will follow you.
I have so much to tell you, Zeddicus.
Jack's in trouble!
I've absorbed most of my powers.
you forget who's after us. Stop them.
because you forced them...?
I'm glad we didn't part on worse terms.
helps you find whatever it is you're looking for.
someone loving you, wanting to be with you,
let's try something a bit more challenging, shall we?
a force powerful enough to fight rahl and his followers.
uh, Kahlan, uh, about back at the river.
give ordinary folk powers they shouldn't have.
I don't know which is more merciful.
I saw the way you were looking at her.
another wizard.
you say you want to destroy rahl?
there aren't any easy answers.
by the time you lay eyes on them falls in love with the woman who confessed him.
hear me out. I've heard more than enough!
Ah, yes.
what you were planning to do with me in
tell them to move. Jeziah!
strike me down if you can, seeker.
I knew you'd be back.
they've taken my powers.
Why? No one can find us here.
it'll be good to have some company.
we're leaving as soon as the quillion has done its work.
your instinct as a seeker. It led you to the boy.
they must've used a spell to cloak their trail.
get rid of them.
this? My father gave this to me.
but-- most people thought it was just legend.
he was a-- he was a fine young man until his
but I hope someday we can be friends.
I would've used it to absorb your magic,
it only grows where there's fresh water nearby,
not just for a few minutes, but all the time.
and distill it into this.
and that his soldiers are out there, trying to kill me.
people deserve a chance to change.
Kahlan? Kahlan?
I found something that belongs to you.
he has his sympathizers and collaborators.
the event that I wasn't your old friend?
ready to do the biing of whoever pays the most.
with a single touch, Kahlan can bend anyone to her will.
everyone in this village is in your debt.
why would you assume I worked for that tyrant?
but you have to admit, it's working.
I guess you should've stolen someone else's horses.
so, what lessons do you draw from all this, seeker?
you'll be able to see right through your opponents' cards.
where there is no way, the seeker will find a path.
drain them of their magic. Create a more powerful army!
I've been a thief, a liar.
we're taking you to a healer.
we crossed the boundary two months ago,
parents traded everything they had for magic.
all I see are thugs and thieves.
Richard, you've seen what these potions can do.
but here you are, ready t-t
using magic to acquire power over others?
I won't leave you again, my lady.
you must learn to perceive the world as no one else can.
so the question is,
if you had been one of rahl's wizards,
magic is-- is rare.
and how you're starting to notice him.
and we've been on the road since then.
if he saw you relying on magic instead of your wits,
it's something that's not easy for Kahlan.
I know this doesn't make up for what I did.
maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to dismiss your instincts.
I see the way he looks at you,
the potions you sell. Where do they come from?
it was our training that helped you defeat jeziah.
no. Magic is not meant to be used in that way.
where have you been all these years?
I never see anyone buy flowers for the flower girl.
the prophecy said that the seeker would one day return,
what on the prophet's good earth could have distracted you?
you'll wear the rada'han for the rest of your life.
Rahl isn't playing by any rules.
cut me loose and i'll tell him to let you go.
he was, uh-- he was left to fend for himself.
so then, magic is a good thing?
the sale of these potions will allow me to raise a militia.
or she can compel him to do unimaginable things.
you expect me to help you?
and when you have a problem that you can't solve with magic,
uh, one day, they were just here.
they're on every street corner, in the tavern...
where is your militia, jeziah?
you'll never have the powers of a wizard again, old friend.
I want to defeat darken rahl too.
and lift the shroud of darkness from our-- from our lives,
thank you for letting me die
the vision you had of zedd, what do you remember?
confessors can be quite persuasive.
but you know neither of you can ever act on these feelings.
then I'm sorry, I can't help you.
maybe she'll tell you-- I didn't mean now!
I can find zedd, but we have to go now.
to see that which is not there, gaze upon what is.
the pint you drank. I mixed in something magical.
to see that which is not there, gaze upon what is.
and that justifies exploiting these villagers?
your enemies will be far more devious than a melon.
seems like everybody in the village is buying their potions.
the, uh-- the markings.
then, Theodoro, I want you to leave this village.
Drundril was a good place to live before they came.
are you sure you're not just making yourself rich?
Yes, he is the genuine article.
we can find other wizards and sorcerers working for rahl.
it wasn't any "seeker instinct."
that's the wizard who stole my powers.
using magic for your own gain.
to save our village from these magic peddlers.
children are being left to go hungry.
leave this village and take up honest work.
I need something to give me luck at the table.
but if I hadn't used the potion,
you gotta come right away!
I-I've lost most of my customers.
Theodoro Rymus, at your service.
the people of the midlands have new reason to hope.
but I can tell you who does for 10-- no, 20 pieces of gold.
I-- I saw your blade.
he won't be able to use his magic.
I believe you have some horses that were stolen from us.
if you're interested, you know where to find me.
Richard, you should never lie to a confessor.
trust me, it won't make you happy.
curses, hexes, spells of every kind.
when I confess someone, they lose their free will.
to see that which is not there, gaze upon what is.
you forgotten more about magic than i'll ever know.
and now that the seeker is here, it can be good again.
are you going to tell him, or shall I?
perhaps someone there will be kind enough to sell us back our horses.
are they going to be the generals in your army of the midlands?
you didn't really think you had some kind of special power,
to kill him, or force him to live without his powers.
now, I want my money, or the potion I paid for.
the potion, I think it's wearing off.
these peddlers, they're not wizards or sorcerers.
I'll carry your pack all day long, if you give me ten more minutes are you alright?
have a heart Zedd
Richard, it's me, Michael.
how did you--?
how did I get here?
some guards found you at the bottom of the cliff and carried you home.
you've bn out for two days.
that's not true.
Where's Zedd?
Where's Kahlan?
how'd I get through the Boundary?
you're not making sense. You should be lying down, you had quite a fall.
this is some kind of trick, isn't it?
Richard-- -Well, it's not going to work.
I know it wasn't Kahlan who killed Dad.
I know it was Fane.
and you helped him!
Richard, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about Dad dying, right outside that door!
richard: I tried to stop the bleeding, but it was too late.
dad?
I felt the life go out of him.
we saw the smoke.
what happened?
he's dead.
richard: You accused me, your own brother.
did the witch make you do this?
Michael, you can't possibly believe
I don't know what to believe.
it was Rannsyn Fane.
he's with Chase, looking for you.
you're not going anywhere. Take him.
stay back!
witchcraft.
fane was right.
you would've had me arrested, and who knows who else, if I hadn't gotten away.
I'm calling a healer. You must've hit your head
tell me what you did to Zedd and Kahlan, or I swear, I will beat it out of you!
son.
you're up and about.
dad?
Oh, thank the Spirits.
it wasn't a dream.
I've been gone for months.
I've fought battles, I've-- I've killed people.
I fell asleep in the forest with Zedd and Kahlan, and then
I know what happened.
darken Rahl used some kind of magic to wind the clock back to the day I met Kahlan.
to right before it all began.
who's Kahlan?
she's a Confessor.
she came through the Boundary, withThe Book of Counted Shadows, looking for me.
but the D'Harans were after her.
richard: They were hunting her like an animal.
they chased her all the way across the Midlands, and through the Boundary, trying to kill her.
I had to help her.
richard: They cornered her on the edge of Dead Man's Cliff.
stay back.
shoot her.
leave her alone.
you're making a mistake, boy.
this girl is dangerous.
four men against one woman?
I think she's the one in danger.
and go home.
I'm not going any
FANE: Easy.
do not let her grasp you.
richard: They were scared of her.
she used magic against them.
richard: But using her power made her weak.
fane would've killed her if I hadn't been there.
FANE: It's over for you, Confessor.
richard: We were at the edge of the cliff...
the fall should've killed him.
but when I looked over, he was gone.
he fell a hundred feet and walked away.
whoever thought my son would have such a vid imagination?
Richard, not so much as a mosquito has ever crossed the Boundary.
everybody knows it's impenetrable.
well, then everybody is wrong.
I need to talk to Zedd.
what, the crazy old man who talks to his chickens?
why would you wanna talk to him?
don't try to stop me.
something terrible's happened.
darken Rahl did some kind of spell that sent me back to the day I first came here.
but I know everything. I know I'm the Seeker
slow down, slow down.
you're Richard Cypher, aren't you?
George's boy. Grown up to be a fine figure of a young man, don't you think, Clara?
Zedd, I know who you are.
I know you brought me here from the Midlands,
I know you've been watching over me my whole life.
he fell off Dead Man's Bluff and hit his head.
Michael: It's gotten him all mixed-up.
Zedd, tell them it's true.
tell them you're a Wizard.
well, that's a new one.
imagine, someone taking me for a Wizard, hm?
he's pretending because he doesn't trust you.
but it's true.
I got bit by some kind of vine that Kahlan brought through the Boundary.
it made me sick, I fell off my horse, and when I came to I was right there, on that bed.
richard: You healed me with magic.
his fever's broken.
now take me to the Seeker.
he's here.
richard: It turned out I was the person she came all this way looking for.
him?
but-- But he's-- -What?
not good enough?
you wanted a Seeker, there he is.
if he's not up to your standards, well, that's fine by me.
find yourself another.
richard: Seeker?
what are you talking about?
you never told him?
you were supposed to train him, prepare him.
what have you been doing for the last 20 years?
letting him catch worms, steal apples, skin his knees, find out what makes his heart beat faster.
my sister gave her life to make sure that I got here, to make sure that I put the Book in the Seeker's hands.
and he's catching worms?
I never knew a great man who didn't have a little dirt under his nails.
and while he's getting his nails dirty, did it ever occur to you to give him the slightest inkling that he is the first true Seeker in the last thousand years?
he has a destiny.
who are you to decide a man's destiny?
it's not me. It's the Prophecy
prophecy be damned!
stop.
what are you talking about?
and what's a Seeker?
richard: And then you told me it was my destiny to kill Darken Rahl, the leader of the D'Harans.
and then you gave me the Sword of Truth.
sword of Truth?
which was right over there.
it was invisible.
you pulled it out of the air.
we'd give all our toes and feathers if our lives could be only that exciting, wouldn't we, Clara?
I can't believe I could've dreamed all that.
I'm not dead, Richard.
I'm right here.
and I'm not going anywhere.
but if all this is real, and everything that happened was a dream, then there's no Kahlan.
she doesn't exist.
Yes, I do. Richard, I'm right here.
she's just something I dreamed.
Richard, you're dreaming now.
wake up.
what is it?
he's talking in his sleep.
how could all that have just been a dream?
I can't wake him.
you won't be able to.
what do you mean?
the Three Stars of Amberlis appear within the circle of the crescent moon once every 119 years.
and when they do, it becomes possible to cast the Spell of the Lying Moon.
what kind of spell is that?
powerful magic that causes the victim to fall into a dream where he believes that he is among friends when he is among enemies.
and in that dream, a man will reveal secrets that in his waking life he would only share with those he trusts most.
who would have done this to Richard? And why?
only one Wizard in the world besides me is capable of working this magic, and that Wizard works for Darken Rahl.
we have to get him out of the moonlight.
it's too late. The spell has already taken hold.
well, can't you undo it?
I can try.
what's going to happen to him?
do you see how one star is beginning to disappear behind the moon?
if we can't get him out before all three stars have gone, we may never get him out.
Richard, there's nobody called Kahlan.
and Zedd isn't a Wizard.
Michael: We need to get him to a healer.
the boy doesn't need a healer.
he just needs a little time.
I only wish I had the powers you dreamed up for me, but I do know a few little healing tricks, and one of them is that there's no cure for the frightening grip of a nightmare like telling it to a friendly listener.
and there's no one friendlier than Clara.
so tell us, did you take up this sword?
did you defeat this dastardly Rannsyn Fane, hm?
come, Richard.
at the very least, it'll make a good story.
it doesn't feel like a story.
Zedd: I know, but tell it anyway.
I promise you, it'll do you good.
go on, son.
after I rode home, after Dad died in the burning house,
I came after Fane, but he got away.
he was heading for the Boundary.
we raced after him, I fought him.
we had to stop him.
he hadThe Book of Counted Shadows.
if Rahl got the Book, it would give him the secrets of power.
richard: I don't know how I was able to fight like that.
it was like I was getting some kind of power from the Sword.
I felt rage, anger, like I'd never felt before.
I was the bringer of death.
it was the first time I ever killed anybod
but not the last.
KAHLAN: You did it.
you are the Seeker.
Zedd: Fascinating! Incomparable!
magical swords, magical vines.
Oh, I admit I've always had a fondness for this sort of tale.
what other wondrous objects did you come upon?
this isn't funny to me.
forgive me. Forgive me.
I've just gotten so caught up in the story.
please, keep going.
give a little pleasure to a lonely old man.
well, there were a lot of magical objects.
but nothing was amazing as the magical people.
I met a boy who could see what people were thinking, like he was reading a book.
now, there's a trick I'd like to have up my sleeve.
tell us about him.
well, we had to save him from the D'Harans, so Darken Rahl couldn't get control of his powers.
richard: It's okay. We're friends.
we just wanna take you home.
but he didn't exactly wanna be saved.
he was used to getting his own way.
I want pheasant with blackberry sauce.
well, the first pheasant I see is all yours.
I saw a nest of pheasants a mile back, and there were blackberries growing all over.
no, we don't have time.
if you're in a hurry, I'm not stopping you.
I'll just wait right here for the D'Harans to find me.
listen, we're not stopping to pick blackberries and hunt pheasant.
then I guess I'll have to tell her about the secret you've been keeping from her.
I don't have any secrets from Kahlan.
I'm a Listener.
do you think there's anything you can hide from me?
how would you like her to know what you think about when you look at her?
Zedd: I blush to think of what thoughts the little monster may have glimpsed.
Oh, he wasn't so bad.
once the D'Harans attacked, and he saw what they were really about, he started to trust us.
it's okay.
just an owl complaing about something, the way owls do.
does it still hurt?
I would say no, but you'd know I'd be lying.
why haven't you told her what you feel about her?
it's complicated.
you'll understand when you get older.
it's not that complicated.
you're just scared she doesn't feel the same way.
but you don't have to be scared.
she feels the same way you do.
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
Richard, come back! You need to
rest yourself and stay calm.
a blow to the head can be a dangerous thing.
be careful, Lord Rahl.
if you push him too hard, you could shatter the spell.
I will push him as hard as I have to, until he tells me where he has hidden the third Box of Orden.
the deeper the spell takes him, the more the fever will rage.
Richard, your father and brother-- --are worried sick about you.
come back.
what is it, boy?
you can talk to me.
I can't believe Kahlan's not real.
how could I just imagine feeling that way about somebody?
we all have our little fantasies, hm?
I'd like to be alone right now.
I'm not getting anywhere.
the idiot's gone and fallen in love with his Confessor.
she's all he can think about.
now, why can't I just reach into his mind and see where he hid the box?
childhood memories are easy, Lord Rahl.
but a secret as important to the Seeker as where he has hidden the box is sure to be locked away where even the Magic of Amberlis has to work hard to find it.
as for his love of his Confessor, he's a young man like any other.
surely there's a girl he left behind, some fresh-faced maiden of the forest who can draw his thoughts away from Kahlan Amnell.
what are you doing here? How did--?
I came as soon as I heard.
south Haven to Hartland in two days.
let somebody try to beat that.
do you hate me?
for moving away, for never writing?
I was angry for a long time, but I could never hate you, Anna.
only Richard Cypher would be crazy enough to go running around the edge of Dead Man's Cliff.
what were you thinking?
I was helping somebody.
the woman in the white dress?
you saw her too?
no. I went to your house.
your brother and your father told me about your dream.
tell me what happened in this other place.
for a dream to be that real, there must be something important in it.
something you can learn from it.
Richard, do you remember when that little black dog you had that got swept away in the big flood?
we were what, 7 years old?
you ran away and nobody could find you.
I was hiding in your cellar.
because you didn't want anyone-- --to see you cry.
and you stayed there all day, and you told me all about Arrow's great heroic deeds.
and then you went home, and nobody ever saw a tear on your face.
except me.
talk to me, Richard. Get it out. Tell me everything.
tell me the worst, scariest thing that happened.
it was one scary thing after another.
like what?
well, nothing was scarier than the Mord-Sith.
no one's going to train me.
did you not feel my Agiel?
the harder you fight, the more painful its magic will become.
and after I've finished training you with it, you'll do anything to please me.
anything.
and nothing will please me more than to see the Seeker stand at the gates of the People's Palace, and there, before the multitudes, take the hand of Lord Rahl and pledge undying love and fealty to him.
no.
I'm going to take that sword and I'm going to kill him with it...
after I kill you.
I do enjoy a challenge.
shall we begin?
nothing in a dream could hurt like that.
nothing in a dream could leave a scar.
Anna, it left a scar, right here.
HD Just keep telling it, Richard.
keep getting it out.
how did you escape from that horrible place?
Kahlan tried to save me.
who's Kahlan?
the woman in white.
richard: I don't even know how long I'd been in that dungeon.
I was completely under Denna's power.
do it now.
kill her.
I can't.
then watch her suffer.
DENNA: End her pain, Richard.
richard: But she wouldn't give up.
she was testing me, tormenting me.
but something stopped me.
I was so close.
I can't explain it.
any magic you use against a Mord-Sith comes back at you 10 times stronger, with more pain that you can possibly imagine.
how did you--?
you taught me how to withstand pain.
that's quite a dream.
you almost died for this Kahlan.
not as many times as she almost died for me.
did she look like me?
no.
Richard, going with my parents when they moved to South Haven was the stupidest thing I ever did.
you were 19, you could have stayed.
why didn't you?
all our lives, from when we were 5 years old, it was always:
richard and Anna were born for each other.
what are you going to wear to the wedding?
you were the only man I'd ever kissed.
it took hearing you'd fallen off that cliff and almost died for me to realize that you're the only man I ever want to kiss.
I'm sorry, but I don't have magical powers and I'm not much good in a knife fight, but I love you, Richard.
am I too late?
do you still care for me? -Yes, I care for you, Anna.
who's Anna?
I will always care for you but
you're home, Richard.
you're home, with me.
and I'm never leaving you again.
he's in my hands.
and now to find the box.
not yet, Lord Rahl.
if you move too fast, if he suspects the truth
and he is the Seeker of Truth, after all.
the spell will shatter.
keep pulling him in.
so, what happened with this woman in white?
did you marry her?
no.
well, that's good.
I wouldn't want you marrying somebody else, not even in a dream.
actually, I did marry somebody else.
well, not really.
it's complicated.
a powerful witch put a spell on me that made everybody who looked at me think I was somebody else.
even Kahlan.
what are you doing?
put down Richard's sword, Gryff.
the Sword of Truth is not a toy.
what's going on?
how did Gryff get his hands on your sword, Richard?
no harm done.
the Sword of Truth belongs in the hands of the Seeker.
this is insane. It's me, Richard.
bronwyn is a very lucky girl.
you'll make a fine husband.
I think we should get moving.
all: To Lord Rahl.
richard: They thought I was Gryff, the son of a wealthy merchant, betrothed to girl named Bronwyn.
if these things are uncomfortable, we can take them off.
what's wrong with you?
you know tradition doesn't allow it.
it stays on until morning.
after we've spent our first night together as man and wife.
BRIGGS: There are a lot of things I want to say, but first let me start by wishing my little sister and her new husband many, many children. And
we should get started on that right away.
so in your dream did you actually...?
no, no, no.
I had to get out of there.
Zedd and Kahlan were on their way to the ancient ruined city of Kelabra, where Darken Rahl was massing hundreds of men.
what was Rahl looking for in the ruins?
did you ever find out?
richard: Yes, and it turned out to be more important than we could ever have imagined.
it was the second Box of Orden.
Richard. -Just as I thought.
Rahl is trying to find out where the box is.
Richard, don't say any more.
you see, each one of these boxes contained unlievably powerful magic.
Rahl had the first box. He found the second in Kelabra.
all through the dream, Zedd and Kahlan kept telling me if he got all three, he would have the power to enslave the world.
we had to get to the third box before Rahl did.
Richard. -What did I tell you, Lord Rahl?
your patience has been rewarded.
where was it, Richard?
Anna: Where was the third Box of Orden?
the box was in the treasure room of Tamarang, the most heavily guarded castle in the Midlands.
the only way in was for Zedd to enter a competion to be an entertainer at Princess Violet's birthday party.
greetings, Your Highness.
richard: But apparently Princess Violet was very hard to please.
Hello, Princess Violet.
I'm Mr. Stocking. Happy Birthday.
guards!
throw this idiot off the grounds before I chop off his head.
forgive me, Your Magnificence, for disappointing you.
where you going without me?
what do you mean, where am I going without you?
I lost the job because of you, you worthless, stinking rag.
first you blame me for losing the job, now you blame me for being stinky.
something sure smells around here, but it isn't me.
you're hired.
Ruben Rybnik, Grand Puppeteer, at Her Majesty's service.
once Zedd was inside the castle he managed to steal the key to the treasure room.
he used his magic to turn an ordinary spice box into a perfect copy of the third Box of Orden.
but that wasn't the end of the story.
what are you doing in here?
F-Forgive me, princess.
my curiosity overcame me.
how stupid do you think I am?
you have two seconds to tell me what's going on before I scream my head off and wake up the whole castle.
you may want to turn and look in the mirror before you make good on that threat.
my face! My beautiful face.
what have you done to me?
change me back right now, or I'll chop your head off.
how will you get rid of the warts if you chop my head off?
it's called a Tattletale Curse, Your Celestial Highness.
I can take it away, but if you ever even think of telling on me, the warts will reappear. Forever.
richard: Zedd gave the box to Violet's poor servant girl, Rachel.
you're now the most important person in the world.
richard: But she had to hide the box from Violet.
what are you doing in here?
richard: Violet had very sharp eyes.
do you have something behind your back?
richard: If caught Rachel, they would have boiled her alive in molten lead.
even though she was a little girl, she was one of the bravest people I've ever met.
I finally had the third Box of Orden in my hands.
Anna: What did you do with the box once you had it?
richard: We were heading for a place where Zedd thought he could hide it away, when we passed through a forest crawling with D'Haran soldiers.
I broke away from the others, and found a place to bury the box.
just for a little while, until things quieted down.
he's going to tell them where it is. Richard.
where could you possibly bury it that would be safe enough for something so precious?
I hid it under a tree a few leagues west of Trollsbridge.
send the Dragon Corps to Trollsbridge.
under a tree?
doesn't sound terribly safe to me.
what kind of tree was it?
what does it matter what kind of tree?
I was just wondering if they have the same kind of trees in dreamland as they do here.
do they have wayward pine, alghars, wanderer's elm?
how do you know about alghars?
they only grow in the Midlands, not here.
there were alghars in the story books my mother used to read me.
your mother must have read them to you too.
maybe that's how they got into your dream.
so it was an alghar?
I know this is crazy, but back there in my dream, or whatever it was, the fate of the world depended on nobody knowing where that box is, and-- I don't know, it just feels wrong to tell anyone where it is.
Richard, I love you.
I've always loved you.
I want to make a life with you. I know that now.
now that I almost lost you.
but if you don't trust me enough to tell me something that happened to you in a-- --dream, then what did it all mean?
all the years we were together, all the times we talked about our future
thinking up mes for our children...
was that all a lie?
no, Anna, it wasn't a lie.
these memories, these phantoms you think are so real, they're not just something from a dream.
they're bad spirits-- --trying to drag you into the dark, and they won't let go of you unless you show them you don't believe their lies.
say the word.
say the name of the tree the box was buried under.
break the chains, Richard. Break the chains!
send the bad spirits back-- --where they came from.
I'm here, Richard, I'm right here.
come back to me.
Zedd: It's no use.
the Spell of the Lying Moon is impenetrable.
no.
I can get through.
I know that I can.
Richard, it's me, Kahlan.
don't listen to what they're telling you.
remember all the things we've been through.
think of me, Richard.
I'm right here.
I need you, Richard.
I need you here with me.
that night, in the forest,
I never wanted that kiss to end.
the next day, when you stopped me on the path...
look me in the eye and tell me you don't have the same feelings for me that I have for you.
I don't have any feelings for you.
and I never will.
KAHLAN: But that was a lie.
this is the truth:
I love you, Richard.
I love you, Richard.
I love you, Richard.
I love you and I never want to lose you again.
tell me.
break the chains.
Richard, come back.
it's a kind of tree that doesn't grow near here.
No!
please, come back to me.
I love you, Richard.
Anna: I love you, Richard.
you'd like it, it blossoms-- -It blossoms in the spring?
KAHLAN: You are the Seeker.
whatever lies they're telling you, use your inner power.
the power to see the truth.
Anna: What is it? What's wrong?
KAHLAN: See it. See the truth.
you're scaring me, Richard.
why are you looking at me like that?
No!
we need to dig up the box. Fast!
cast the spell again.
I'm not finished.
I'm afraid you are, my lord.
it's too late.
you've been awfully quiet.
Ah, I've just been thinking.
if you really exist and if Zedd's really a Wizard, and not the chicken man of Blackthorn Hill...
then my dad really is dead.
so how did you know it was a trick?
what brought you out of it?
as real as it was in every way, nothing in my life has been more real than you.
and right when I was about to tell Anna where the box was,
I suddenly, absolutely, knew you existed.
I knew it, because I felt
I felt your love for me.
I tracked it for days.
it's my trophy.
I ran the animal to the ground...
and watched it die. The trophy is mine.
he's lying, confessor. He only wounded the creature.
it was my arrow that killed it.
I can see that neither of you is sure
whose arrow truly killed the creature?
so I can't fairly award the trophy to either of you.
is there someone you both know
who could use the health and good luck such a trophy would bring?
Gethin's wife has been ill.
then give the trophy to Gethin,
and forgive each other for this feud.
Yes, confessor.
thank you.
as you both agreed to abide by the covenant of the confessor,
I will now hear your dispute.
there are more people here now
than there were when we got here.
patience, Richard.
this valley hasn't seen a confessor in years.
do you have any idea how much bad blood
can flow when people have no one to settle their disputes?
how does she know who's telling the truth?
a confessor has power beyond her magic.
she often senses the truth without using her touch.
she can ferret out lies, and heal the rifts
that come from keeping secrets.
and everybody just does what she says?
a confessor is the highest moral authority in the midlands.
people abide by her judgments.
Richard.
Matthias and I are heading out on a hunt.
probably no more than a day's ride.
we'd be honored. What are you hunting?
worthy prey, a 14-point buck.
richard can't. What?
excuse us.
you can't just ride off on your own.
back in Hartland, I was on my own all the time,
sometimes for days.
that was before you were the seeker.
before darken Rahl wanted to kill you.
Gavin and matthias will be with me. it's not safe.
lesson number 15:
in honoring what others most honor,
the seeker shall win their hearts.
hunting is their most honored tradition.
Oh, so when it's convenient, you remember your lessons.
Kahlan will be busy for days.
wo Zeddicus zu'l zorander.
it is you.
I heard there was a wizard in the camp,
but I hardly dared to imagine.
you promised you would never forget
that night at the fire springs.
Sylvia!
if I recall, it was more than one night.
so we're agreed, then, hm.
you'll spend time with your friend,
and I'll go hunting.
which way are you going?
the stag was seen heading east.
remember, not everyone in the midlands
is friendly. Be careful.
you too.
this is one crafty stag.
now he's turn west. Then let's go west.
Hyah! Hyah!
I thought we were leagues from the nearest town.
the stag has led us further than I thought.
that's Brennidon, I think.
Brennidon?
you know it?
I was born there.
I'm surprised Zedd didn't tell me
we were close by.
you weren't.
he didn't expect us to be riding west.
how long since you've been there?
not since I was a baby.
I wonder which house was mine,
where my parents lived.
do your parents still live there?
I don't know.
don't you wanna find out?
uh, I told Zedd I'd stay with you.
but it wouldn't hurt to take a look around
for an hour or so.
and maybe we'll have taken the stag
by the time you catch up with us.
all right.
a terrible sight, isn't it?
who are they?
the firstborn sons of Brennidon,
murdered by darken Rahl's men to avert a prophecy.
the prophecy of the seeker.
you know of it?
I've heard the story.
you've heard of it? it's not just a story.
all these children were murdered because of it,
the seeker among them.
and when he died,
so did Brennidon's future.
maybe the seeker's out there somewhere,
ready to rise up and defeat darken Rahl.
twenty-three years have gone by
and Rahl is advancing through the midlands.
no seeker has surfaced.
so if he lives, he's a coward,
and our children have died for nothing.
guard 1: papers, please. Guard 2: all right, clear.
come on, who's next? Guard 3: come on.
come on, move along.
keep walking.
you. Where's your pass?
pass?
no pass no entry.
who's next?
keep moving.
all right, clear.
okay, show me your papers.
keep moving.
move along.
keep to the main square, now.
this young woman
has been preaching heresy.
gathering her friends,
telling them that lord Rahl is not our true leader.
we all know the consequences of defying lord Rahl.
so for the past 20 years,
you have chosen to live by certain standards.
allowing those of us from the patrol to protect you.
this girl thinks she knows better than the town elders.
we must cast rebels out publicly.
so lord Rahl knows we will never defy him again.
may your rebellious spirit
wander the underworld for all time.
stop!
you can't kill her just for speaking her mind.
who are you? Show me your papers.
just let her go. This doesn't have to be a fight.
take him.
the sword of truth.
it's the seeker!
arrest him!
run, hide yourself!
alert the sentries! Close the gates!
split into two.
go around the other side.
I want to help you.
follow me.
the seeker went this way.
thank you for helping me.
look at you.
you know me?
I held you in my arms the night you were born,
and then the wizard took you away.
are you saying...
...you're my mother?
Yes.
if you surrender the army,
it's going to upset the townspeople.
we had an agreement
that if we submitted to darken Rahl's rule,
Brennidon would be free of your forces.
the agreement was not for your benefit.
your part of the bargain was to deliver him to us
if he did come back.
I alerted you as soon as I knew.
now I have no choice but to bring in my own forces.
wait. Give us some time.
the seeker is within the city walls. He could not have escaped.
we're searching every house in Brennidon.
he will be in your hands before nightfall.
he had better be.
I called you Owen, after your father.
my father?
he passed away. Not long after.
did the wizard give you to good people?
very good people.
I can see they've raised a fine man.
what you did to save that girl
well, they were going to kill her.
and everyone was just going to stand around and watch?
people are terrified of darken Rahl.
I don't understand.
Rahl didn't kill the children of this town
because you defied his edicts
Rahl gave a warning before the massacre.
they refused.
so Rahl massacred all the children.
and now people are scared that if they anger Rahl,
even in the slightest way,
he'll send his assassins back.
so you let these patrols control everything you do and say?
many of us think that it's wrong to give up our freedom
to appease Rahl, but you saw what happens
to the people that speak out.
but now the seeker is back,
ready to fulfill his destiny.
and maybe, now that you're here,
the rest of us will find the strength to stand with you.
mom.
they're saying the seeker is in town.
but the seeker was killed.
no, Mark, he wasn't.
this is Richard.
he's the seeker.
I'm your brother.
I'm glad you're back, Zedd.
I'm afraid I won't be staying, my dear.
of course.
you've always had some higher calling to follow.
this search for a mythical creature,
that hunts for a lost spell.
well, at least your excuses for leaving
were always more interesting than most men's.
but this time, your duty lies here.
what do you mean?
Allard?
Zedd, I want you to meet Allard.
your son.
my mother never said my father was a great wizard.
I'm not your father.
of course you are.
he's got your coloring.
your eyes.
every time I look at him, I see you.
you must be under an illusion spell.
it's your duty as his father to train him
and teach him the ways of the world.
he's a grown man.
who you abandoned.
he's no child of mine!
I took precautions.
magical precautions.
maybe I should wait outside.
you were in the throes of passion.
by the time you'd even thought of taking precautions
he's not my son!
and I'll prove it.
how?
confess us.
about what?
it's a matter of...
...paternity.
you told me my brother was dead.
everyone needed to think he was dead until he could fulfill his destiny as the seeker.
if anyone knew he'd survived, darken Rahl would have pursued him to the edge of the world.
if they find him here, they'll execute us.
they're searching the houses now.
he's right.
I have to leave.
I don't want you to go.
I'll find my friends; tell them what happened in Brennidon.
we'll find a way to help you.
come on, keep searching!
you know the patrols, Mark.
couldn't you get one of them to help us?
please, Mark.
I could hide him until nightfall, maybe ask the gatekeepers.
I might be able to get him to look the other way.
this one!
come on.
you won't find anything here.
down here!
okay.
move along. Keep walking.
this place has been empty for years.
no one comes here.
you'll be safe in the cellar.
thanks for your help.
I'm not trying to help you.
mark! Don't do this!
mark!
show me your papers. -move.
please, you have to come.
I've caught the seeker. This way.
how could a boy like you capture him?
he defeated my best men. -So I tricked him.
please, I can take you there.
well, where is he?
and there's no possibility of anyone else being Allard's father?
there was another man, uh, Steffan, but i only saw him once.
Aha! Vixen. This Steffan must be the father.
or it could be you.
it's your turn.
are you Allard's father?
I used protection.
magical protection.
and this magic, could it have failed?
never.
it's my own spell. It's foolproof.
and you used it every time?
Zedd, you're honor bound to tell a confessor the truth.
not in front of her.
leave us.
was there an occasion when you didn't use your magic?
Zedd, unless you're completely truthful, unless you confess whatever it is that you're hiding, I can't absolve you of your responsibility to Allard.
we'll gather more men.
we'll search the houses again.
and whoever hid him will hide him again.
nobody in Brennidon would dare.
someone hid him 23 years ago.
think, Andrew.
who would feel such loyalty to the seeker?
his mother, perhaps?
but we don't know who the seeker's mother is.
we can find out.
you there.
where are you going?
the seeker may have escaped.
I have orders to search outside the gate.
we've received new orders.
the patrols are to gather the mothers of the firstborn and take them to the town square.
the mothers?
to force the seeker out of hiding.
I helped you! Leave her alone!
Zedd is not Allard's father.
but he was hiding something
Yes, but that didn't concern your dispute.
this is my final judgment.
Yes, confessor.
I'm sorry, Zedd. I
I really hoped that you were Allard's father.
I thought he might be happier with you.
Why?
he doesn't even know me.
wizards are strong.
their strength comes from their minds, not their bodies.
she doesn't want to say this, but I'm hopeless as a hunter.
that's not true.
as a child, you were fearless.
did something happen to make you fearful?
what was it?
a boar hunt. Sylvia: you never went on a boar hunt. Allard: I was only 8.
you'd have said I was too young.
but I went with Rolant and Rolant.
I got caught between them and the boar, and...
I was so scared.
you didn't lose your skills.
you were just frightened.
it doesn't matter.
if I'm asked on a hunt, I can't.
I think I can help you.
hurry, there. Don't delay.
move along.
Brigid!
Brigid, the D'harans. They've come back.
d'harans.
what I want is simple.
give the seeker to me.
then everyone can go back to their lives.
what happened here 23 years ago was a tragedy.
but it was necessary for the greater good.
he speaks the truth.
I think we've all seen that darken Rahl will do anything to bring peace to the midlands.
see?
this woman is wise.
listen to her.
what was lord Rahl to do?
face the seeker as a grown man who could defend himself
and carry out the prophecy?
no.
he had to kill our children!
the seeker stood up to the patrols this morning.
he saved a girl's life.
no one else has had the courage to do that.
if we betray the seeker because we are afraid,
then the children of Brennidon died for nothing!
silence her!
I'm the one you're looking for!
I am the seeker's mother!
but I will never help you find him.
arrest her!
No!
she's protecting me.
the seeker is my son.
not hers.
he's my son.
woman 1: no, I am the seeker's mother!
woman 2: no, he's my son! Woman 3: he's my son.
woman 4: no, he's my son!
he's mine. He's my son.
arrest them all!
the seeker has until sunrise
to turn himself in.
if he does not, I will kill one of these women.
and I will kill another for every hour
that the seeker is not found!
clear the way!
mother!
mark? Don't call for the patrol. Just listen to me.
I need your help.
my mother was arrested because of you.
why would I help you?
to save her.
there only way to do that is to turn yourself in.
and then what?
you go back to your life?
your mother comes home and everything returns to normal?
Yes.
you heard what your mother said back in the town square.
your mother wants a better life for you.
she wants the people of Brennidon
to stand up for themselves.
if I turn myself in,
her sacrifice means nothing.
the only thing the D'harans care about is the seeker.
once you're gone-- then the D'harans will go too?
I'd never even heard of the D'harans
until they killed my father.
and I have another brother, back in Hartland.
Michael.
I love him.
but the D'harans turned him against me.
so now I know exactly what they're capable of.
and I know that giving in won't stop them.
what do you want me to do?
after he escaped from the cellar,
I searched for him everywhere.
I couldn't let him destroy Brennidon.
you've done well.
you have what you wanted.
now let the women go.
and why should I do that?
they've all defied lord Rahl.
please. They were only trying to protect me.
I truly am the seeker's mother.
maybe.
or maybe you're just protecting the others.
either way, they all defied lord Rahl and must be punished.
she's telling the truth.
she is the seeker's mother.
and she's the one who's tried to hide him from you.
how do you know this, boy?
because she's my mother too.
you would betray your own mother?
she betrayed Brennidon.
she's not my mother anymore.
mark!
these other women,
they were just being foolish,
trying to help a misguided friend.
you're a very capable young man.
and to show the people of this town that lord Rahl is merciful,
I will release the other women.
you, however, will die alongside your son.
lord Rahl will be pleased by your loyalty.
you will be rewarded.
there's only one thing I want.
to be there when you kill him.
you'll have a place of honor.
at my side.
open the gates, spread the word.
I will kill the seeker at midday.
I want you to summon the fear that you've held for so long.
bring it to the surface.
concentrate on the flames.
that's good, Allard.
now think about how helpless you felt
when the boar attacked you.
feed your fear to the fire.
the fire consumes your fear.
that's good, Allard.
and with the flames,
so goes your fear.
are you sure it worked?
you question the magic of a wizard of the first order?
no, Zedd, of course not.
I was right to come to you.
what kind of spell was that?
it wasn't a spell.
I made it up.
allard couldn't let go of his fear
until I made him think magic had driven it out.
he may not believe it himself,
but he believes in the power of a great wizard.
you're a crafty old devil, Zedd.
I'm sorry I had to make you tell me something you didn't want to.
I've kept that secret buried for 20 years.
I'd like it to remain buried.
and by your honor as a confessor,
you must never tell Richard.
Richard...
...no matter what happens, i'm so glad that i got to see you.
we're going to get out of here.
I don't think so.
I have a plan.
mark's agreed to help me.
I've told him exactly what he needs to do.
mark betrayed you.
he betrayed both of us.
mark needs to be at the platform at the execution.
Oh, but his eyes, they were so cold.
his whole life, he's listened he thinks he's keeping Brennidon safe.
until now, I
I didn't realize what growing up. Listen to me.
what Mark did was a trick.
and Mark would do anything to save you.
this is a horrible thing for a mother to say about her own child, but I don't know if he's strong enough.
what if instead of tricking the d'haran, he was really tricking you?
rabbits?
Where's that stag? I'm hungry for venison.
it was craftier than we thought.
and there were only two of us tracking it.
we'll get it next time. Only two?
Where's Richard?
he must have decided Brennidon?
you said you were traveling east.
Brennidon's west, well, the stag turned west...
Zedd, you said Richard was just going hunting.
darken Rahl knows the seeker is from Brennidon.
he could have men waiting there for him.
why didn't you warn him?
he's the most stubborn man I've ever met.
if I told him we were near Brennidon, no amount of cajoling and Brennidon is the last place. Guard: move along.
come on, people.
why is there such a crowd?
Zedd: what goes on here, friend?
the d'harans have captured the seeker.
he dies at midday.
Hyah!
make room! Make room!
you will watch your son die, as you should have 23 years ago.
and then you will die for your treachery.
the legend of the seeker seems to be greater than the man.
that legend will live on if you kill me.
I am going to kill you, seeker...
...with your own sword.
now, seeker, the prophecy, at last, is averted.
now!
go!
you were wrong, D'haran.
the prophecy was not averted.
Brigid: Mark.
I would never truly betray you.
you were supposed to stay with the hunters.
what were you thinking?
you promised you wouldn't go off on your own.
I didn't intend to.
but if i hadn't have come here, I wouldn't have found my mother.
your mother is alive?
Brigid.
Brigid: Zedd.
I knew that if you turned up, I would have to tell the truth.
Richard, I'm sorry.
I will always love you like a son, but I'm not really your mother.
I did hold you as a baby, the night you were born.
I was the midwife at your birth.
I was there when Zedd took you from your mother's arms.
why did you pretend?
when you asked me if I was your mother, I didn't mean to say yes.
but it was suddenly as if i was looking at my own lost son...
...Owen.
the D'harans killed him.
he was 3.
I'm so sorry.
I couldn't bear to think about his death.
I imagined that he was the one that had survived.
so when I saw you in the square, it was
it was like my Owen had returned.
at least now, I know that he didn't die for nothing.
what about my real mother...?
no, no.
she was very ill for a while, but she lived.
and then one day, she disappeared.
I never saw her again.
I think she went to look for you.
the D'harans may return, Mark.
and I won't be here to help.
if the D'harans return, they'll get a fight.
you've taught us to stand up for ourselves.
besides, you're the seeker.
you've got bigger things to do than look after one town.
take care of your mother.
you know I will.
richard: you were right. Zedd: about what?
insisting on the lessons. The training.
I know I've been pushing you
and now I understand why.
what I saw in Brennidon made me realize what I'm facing.
and I'm going to do whatever it takes to be ready.
and now that I know that my mother is alive...
when all this is over, I'm going to find her.
and someday I'm gonna have a family again.
Zedd, why don't you tell him?
because if Richard knew, he would risk his own safety for mine.
and his life is far more important.
nobody hopes more than I that we find Richard's mother.
and there's nothing I want more than to tell him the truth.
and someday, when all this is over then, then we will have stories to tell.
but until then, he cannot know that I'm his grandfather.
I'm taking breakfast to Evelyn she's still down with that bad leg.
will you be all right till I get back?
Yeah, I've got my accounts to finish.
that's not what I'm talking about, Conor.
I'm worried about you.
you should be worried.
for your own safety, as well.
make sure you stay on the main roads today.
don't you think it's possible you're overreacting to all this?
there's two of us dead, Nella.
well, I don't care if they looked like accidents.
someone out there is targeting the resistance.
when Kahlan gets here, we'll find out who.
Kahlans coming? - I sent an urgent message.
she'll show you the truth of my words.
I don't need a Confessor to tell me I should believe in my husband.
you've decided where we're taking the box?
the one place in all the Midlands where Rahl can't get into, neither by spell nor by force, is the Crypt of the Ancient Seeker at Tavol'Rang.
and that's where we're headed, with a detour to my home town, to pick up the key.
CK up. We need to go now.
agreed. It's a day's walk to my house, and three more to Tavol'Rang.
we need to go by way of East Marwen.
this message found its way to me in the marketplace.
some friends of mine are in trouble.
the entire Midlands is in trouble if we don't get this box locked away safe.
I know.
but the friend that sent that message is a leader in the resistance.
he and his wife risked their lives to hide me when I was running from Aydindril withThe Book of Counted Shadows.
we'll just have to meet up after you get the key.
wait, Kahlan. You can't go alone.
he's right.
a Confessor can't travel without her Seeker, the Seeker can't travel without his Confessor.
but who would trouble themselves with an old man in a tattered cloak?
thank you, Zedd.
I'll meet you in East Marwen, the day after tomorrow, with the key in my hand.
the box goes with me.
too many D'Harans in these parts on the lookout for the Seeker.
nella, what's wrong?
I came as fast as I could
eternal darkness upon the soul of whoever did this.
this is Constable Declan.
I sent for him.
you can speak freely, he's one of us.
I'm Kahlan Amnell.
it's been a long time since we had a Confessor in East Marwen.
you've come when you're most needed.
I'm Richard Cypher.
it is an honor beyond words to meet the Seeker, though I wish we met under happier circumstances.
do you have any idea?
I can't bring Conor back, but I swear to you on my power as a Confessor...
I will bring whoever killed him to justice.
Conor knew he was in danger.
the message he sent to me said that two othe men in your group were already dead.
Yes.
we believe they were murdered by traitors in league with the D'Harans.
one of the men appeared to have taken his own life, but there was no reason for him to have done that.
the other was crushed under his own wagon while he was fixing a wheel, but nobody saw it happen.
when was the last time you saw your husband?
I left before breakfast.
the sun was just coming up.
I spent the morning with a friend, she's been sick, and when I came back the place was torn apart, and I
was anything missing?
just his inkwell.
the golden one his father gave him, and a silver bowl he kept on h
the sick friend you visited, does she live near a marsh?
no, a meadow. Why?
it's just these seeds they're still green, newly fallen, from a stalk of Kindon grass and it only grows in marshes.
there's just one marsh around here.
I've never been to Conor's house in my life.
are you sure about that?
I'm sure.
I-I stay close to home.
so you wouldn't know anything about a mysterious highwayman who roams the roads at night, robbing travelers?
a man like that might even be capable of murder.
no, I-- I wouldn't know anything about that, constable.
well, would you know anything about this?
Kindon seeds.
they were found on the floor of Conor's home.
the only Kindon grass in East Marwen grows in the marsh next to your property.
where were you this morning, Niles, around sunrise?
I was... in the woods.
hunting.
you can't lie to a Confessor, Niles.
never been to Conor's house, have you?
Declan, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, Luna.
Conor Greenleaf is dead.
by your brother's hand.
no. Niles would never
please, don't make this harder than it is.
my brother is not a murder.
let him go.
he won't telme anything.
we need to know the full truth of his crimes, so the people know justice has been done.
will you Confess him?
what if you're wrong, and he's innocent?
he'll lose his mind, his will, for nothing.
I can tell he's lying.
in Westland, we have judges and couels, we make sure somebody is guilty before we punish them.
counsels, no matter how wise, make mistakes.
confessors don't.
it's three murders, Richard.
we owe it to Conor, and we owe it to the resistance.
No! No! No! No!
I got you.
tell me what happened when Conor was killed.
it was the morning.
early in morning.
I went to his house...
I'm sorry I lied to you, Confessor.
I killed him and I took the bowl and the inkwell.
do you know anhing about the deaths of Conor's two friends?
no.
did anyone help you? Are you working with the D'Harans?
nobody helped me.
please, don't hate me.
please.
go with them peacefully.
accept your fate with dignity.
Yes, Confessor.
under the power of a Confessor,
Niles Braggindor has admitted to taking the life of Conor Greenleaf.
he will be punished in accordance with the laws of the Midlands and East Marwen.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I loved Conor like a brother.
I know you did too.
thank you for helping me bring his killer to justice.
this town is lucky to have you.
Conor risked his life thousands of times fighting for freedom, and then he dies in a common robbery.
that still doesn't explain the other two deaths.
constable!
I've been robbed.
sit down, I'll find you a healer.
I don't need to sit, I need to find the thief who stole everything I own.
where did this happen?
two hour's ride north of here, just after sunrise.
a highwayman put a blade to my throat.
I tried to fight him off, but he was too strong.
why don't you come into my chambers? You can describe him.
I don't need to describe him.
he's right in front of me.
that's impossible.
Niles was here in East Marwen at sun up, taking the life of another man.
I'm telling you, he's the one who robbed me.
if that's true, we just executed an innocent man.
good day to you.
Thaddicus, it's me. Zedd.
of course it is.
it's only been 23 years, how could I forget?
there was no way for me to send word.
I was on the other side of the Boundary, in the Westland.
I'm sure you had magical business of earth-shattering importance there.
Yes. I did.
Thaddicus, is Mother, uh--?
here?
of course she is.
where else would she be?
come, she'll be overjoyed to see you.
when?
five years ago.
your name on her lips.
Where's my Zeddicus? Why didn't my Zeddicus ever come home?
you look like something the dog rolled around in.
come in and have something to eat.
and a bath.
a highwayman had a knife to your throat.
you were frightened.
of course I was frightened.
but I know what I saw. - I know, I know.
identical beard, similar clothes.
don't forget his eyes.
Ah, yeah, his eyes.
you were looking into his eyes.
just looking into mine for the past quarter hour.
so what color are they?
my eyes?
Grey.
blue, actually.
amazing how the mind plays tricks under pressure, isn't it?
or... someone paid you to come here and say all this.
and stab me?
a warning, of what they might do if you don't play along.
that man robbed me.
when you confess someone they fall in love with you.
are you sure that once Niles was confessed he didt just tell you what he thought you wanted to hear?
the confessed can't lie to a Confessor, ever, for any reason.
what did they take from you?
uh, a bag of silver. All my tools.
and a bracelet I was bringing to my wife.
green stones in a gold circlet, with rubies along the edge.
you're lying.
what are you going to do, confess me so you can prove that?
apparently your confessions aren't all that reliable.
did you say green stones in a gold circlet?
what about them?
that's it. That's my bracelet.
where did you get that?
my brother gave it to me.
when? - This morning.
right after he stole it from me.
he stole it from you this morning?
around sunrise?
Yes.
then he couldn't have killed Conor.
my brother may have been a thief, but he was no murder.
you killed him. He didn't have to die.
Hey, hey, it's okay.
calm down, Luna.
calm down.
are you proud of yourself, Confessor?
you murdered my brother as sure as you drove a stake into his heart.
I'm sorry, Nella.
Niles didn't kill Conor.
he was robbing a man when your husband died.
you confessed him, Kahlan.
he said he did it.
I don't understand.
neither do I.
if Niles was innocent, then why were Conor's things in his house?
and how did those seeds get on my floor?
we're searching for answers.
we don't have them yet.
maybe we do.
unless a man can be in two places at once, then the whole thing is crazy and every time something crazy happens in the Midlands, there's always one thing behind it: magic.
Richard-- No, I'm right about this.
is there anyone in East Marwen who has magic?
there's a man up in the caves who claims to be a sorcerer.
an innocent man is dead, because of me.
it's not your fault.
okay? It couldn't be.
maybe somebody's doing something to you.
maybe it's Darken Rahl, maybe he's-- No.
not even a Wizard of the First Order has magic powerful enough to work against a Confessor's.
there's something wrong with me.
Hey, listen.
there is an explanation for all this and we'll find it.
I know you.
and who you are is more than some magical power you have.
go! He's getting away.
I'm going to pull it out.
you have to go. Now.
I'm not leaving you.
I'll go into town, I'll get Declan.
you have to catch him.
go. I can walk.
now.
you're a fine cook, Thaddicus.
don't patronize me.
I'm not patronizing you.
you always had a gift in the kitchen.
your vegetables, so fresh and crisp.
as opposed to-- May the Spirits forgive me.
-Mother's.
remember those carrots?
paste.
I gagged every time.
twenty-three years, Zedd.
twenty-three years.
your room's just as you left it.
I go in every now and then, make sure the mice haven't brought the place to ruin.
just passing through, is it?
I came for something very important.
what a surprise.
Zeddicus shows up because he needs something.
and what is it this time?
night Stones? Sorcer's Sand?
well, you're too late.
I sold it all years ago.
you didn't sell what I came for.
the key to the Crypt of Tavol'Rang.
that was the first thing to go.
have any idea what you've done?
our family always protected that key.
it was a sacred vow our ancestors made to the First Order of Wizards.
here's the truth of the situation, brother: I'm not a Wizard.
as you never for one second let me forget.
you know as well as I do that not every child inherits the power.
I am not going to apologize for the ways of fate.
so the way you lorded me, that-- That was fate?
the way you left me to do the kitchen chores because you were meant for greater things?
the way it was always "Run off and play, Thaddicus,
while Father gave his precious time to the traing of the great Zeddicus?
memories are slippery things, but the crack of Father's stick across my knuckles is hard to forget.
you need the key?
why don't you use your mystical powers to conjure it?
you always did love showing off your magic to your poor, powerless brother.
you know it doesn't work that way.
wherever you went, you should have stayed there.
that key was not yours to sell.
you were always like that, no thought of anything beyond the next penny in your poct.
I'll bet all the jewels in Tamarang that whatever you sold it for went straight to the gaming tables.
be sure to bolt the door on your way out.
did you see who it was?
he was just a cloak in the shadow.
are you sure it was a he?
Luna's out of her mind with rage, most of it directed at you.
her father made his living as a hunter, just like Niles.
the girl knows how to use a crossbow.
we need to go her cabin.
I don't think you're rea - Oh, I've had worse.
we're going. Now.
what happened?
I killed her.
I tracked Luna to the house.
I mean, I-I knew it was Luna when I saw the cloak and crossbow.
and then...
and then what? You-- You saw thcrossbow...
I heard a noise. It was Luna.
she attacked me, so I defended myself.
she scratched at my neck.
she was defenseless.
I didn't have to hurt her.
please, don't hurt me.
but I killed her anyway.
I don't believe that you killed that woman.
look at me.
the Richard I know risks his life every day for others.
you wouldn't kill a defenseless woman, I know you.
I did it, Kahlan. I remember it.
just like Niles remembered killing Conor.
maybe his memories weren't real, and neither are yours.
you said that magic had to be behind all this.
well, now I'm starting to agree.
we need to go find that sorcerer.
well, I hope you're right.
cause right now, I don't trust myself.
what if I do something like that again?
you won't. Because I'll be with you.
every second.
what did you come back for, another magical treasure for one of your schemes?
well, go away. I lost them all at cards.
no more waiting, Zorander.
one hundred gold pieces.
you only won 70 off me.
the extra 30 is the price of my patience.
I-- I haven't got any. I can't pay you.
Oh, you're gonna pay.
slowly.
if I can't get my money, then I'll just have to have some fun with you instead.
if you ever dare to show your face to my brother, ever, you'll wish I had burned you to cinders.
now get out.
why'd you come bac
I got about a league from here when my temper cooled and I realized...
the task that calls me away is a grave one, Thaddicus.
the chance that I will not return alive is-- Is great.
I didn't want to go to the Shadows knowing that my last words to the only brother
I have in all the world were unkind and unfair.
now let's get you cleaned up.
you look like one of Mother's turnips after an hour in the pot.
besides, I always did love showing off my powers.
you're the only sorcer anywhere near this village.
do you know anything about these murders?
were they your doing?
no.
he's telling the truth.
and I'm really more of a sorcer-in-training, anyway.
uh-- I've been studying magic books my whole life,
I've learned a few minor tricks, things you can do with powders and potions.
you don't have any powers?
but that doesn't mean I can't help you.
my knowledge in the field is quite extensive.
you say these victims believe they did something they didn't?
they don't just believe...
they actually see themselves doing it in their heads.
shared visions.
memory magic.
I've read something about that... in here.
there are accounts of an ancient device that produces the effect you speak of.
here we go.
Azzallel's Orb.
Azzallel was a fantastically gifted wizard.
his wife gave birth to a blind daughter.
now, Azzallel tried but failed to manifest new eyes for his baby girl.
so instead, he created a way of plucking visions from his head and placing them inside hers.
uh, Azzallel's Orb was stolen 200 years ago and believed to be lost forever.
Hello, Bosin.
still stealing money from old ladies?
I found something.
when we were searching Luna's cabin, one of my men pulled this scorched paper from her fireplace.
there's handwriting there, but I can't make it out.
maybe you'll have better luck.
no luck required.
this I can help you with.
may I?
dust of a Shadrin's thigh bone.
like I said, a few minor tricks.
dearest Luna.
I can't meet you tonight.
I think my wife knows. Missing you desperately. Conor.
Conor and Luna were lovers?
if Nella knew about that, she'd have a good reason to kill her husband... and Luna.
my husband is dead.
why are you doing this to me?
Oh, Nella.
did you kill Conor and Luna?
Yes.
and then gave the memories of what you did to Niles.
and me.
I'm sorry.
where is it, Nella?
Where's the orb?
I told Conor I was leaving to take breakfast to a sick friend.
but I didn't make it very far.
after I killed Conor,
I gathered seeds from the grasses near Niles' cabin and scattered them around the body.
then I ransacked my house and hid our possessions in Niles' cabin.
all that was left was to put the visions of what I did into Niles' head.
and the memories Richard has of murdering Luna?
right after I killed her, Richard came running into the cabin from the woods.
how could I have done such a thing?
it's time to go, Nella.
and lemon cake, my own creation.
you know you could make a living at this.
an honest one.
patronize me again, you'll get a pack full of sand.
where to now?
the less you know about where I'm going, and why, the better, for your own sake.
I know I'm guilty of occasional self-importance, but in this case the of the world actually may depend on the success of the errand that calls me.
in that case...
you'll need this.
the key to the Crypt of Tavol'Rang.
you had it all along?
of course.
mother would've come back from the grave swinging that iron skillet if I'd let it out of my sight for a second.
how could you put me through such a thing?
I was angry that you came home for something you ed... and not to see me.
I need to see you too.
how are you feeling?
like I killed an innocent woman.
I still keep seeing her die.
hearing her screams. Feeling her blood on my nds.
I loved Conor and Nella.
they would've given their lives for me.
they almost did.
to lose them over this?
over jealousy and anger.
you don't have to watch.
uh, the other two who died, I'd like to talk to their families, see if there's anything you didn't find.
I'll take you to them, after.
don't worry,
Conor's work will go on here, no matter what.
are you all right?
Richard, when you described Luna's attack, you said she was scratching you, right?
she went after my face-- Well, Nella's face.
she scratched me right here.
hurt like a stinging nettle.
I just saw three deep scratches in that exact spot on Declan's neck.
what are you saying? - It's no coincidence.
Luna scratched her attacker.
and whoever attacked her committed all the murders.
nella Greenleaf will now be consigned to the Shadows, in accordance with the laws of the Midlands and East Marwen.
wait! - stop!
lower the door. - He killed Conor!
he killed them all! - Now!
no...
I'm not with the resistanc
I've been killing off the resistance.
Why?
I believed in Darken Rahl.
that he would protect us.
you had to know that killing Conor would draw attention.
I had no choice.
Conor was growing suspicious of me.
when he told me he sent for your help, I had to act quickly.
the hard part was making the murder look like Niles did it.
where did you get Azzallel's Orb?
from my father.
it's belonged to my family for hundreds of years.
Oh, it's a wonderful device, really. All you have to do is think of what you want the other person to remember and the orb does the rest.
everything was perfect, until the man Niles robbed on the road showed up, after Niles was hanged.
and then you kept asking questions.
with a Confessor around, I knew I'd never be safe.
so I tried to kill you.
and with the Seeker tracking me, I knew I had to cover my tracks.
I ran straight to Luna's.
don't hurt me.
so you're the one who knocked me out?
I put the memory of Luna's murder into your head.
it seemed like the best plan at the time.
what I didn't count on was the Confessor fighting foyour innocence.
that's when I gave Nella the memories of everything I did.
to make her the mastermind.
so Conor and Luna were never lovers?
I wrote that letter myself.
I knew the hermit had the power to restore burned objects.
it's a trick he performs at children's parties.
did you kill the other two?
the suicide, and the accident?
Yes.
both of them.
I see the error of my ways now, Confessor.
I only hope you allow me to atone by serving your will for the rest of my days.
my will is that you die by nightfall.
Yes, Confessor.
but by then you'd better be a long way from here.
I sent word to the D'Harans that the Seeker was in East Marwen.
they're on their way from Fort Naramond, to take the Seeker.
they'll be here by sundown.
we should go.
there's still one thing I need to do.
it wasn't your fault, Kahlan.
Declan had us all fooled.
I should have suspected him sooner.
at least you got justice for my husband.
anything you need.
whenever you need it.
a remarkable story.
and a very powerful piece of magic.
I remember killing that woman as clearly as I'm looking at you now.
no one should have to live with a memory like that, except a real killer.
if you like, I could use Azzallel's magic here to pluck it from your mind.
I'd be very grateful.
although Richard's probably not the one who needs it most.
would you--?
absolutely not.
no?
what I did really happened.
I'm not as infallible as I thought, and it cost a man's life. I don't ever want to forget that.
things were never this complicated in Westland.
you could always go back.
not a chan.
on to new pressing matters...
the magical key to the Crypt of Tavol'Rang.
you got it.
how was the visit with your family?
it was a visit with family.
you be the hiders,
I'll be the seeker.
all right.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10.
come out, everybody. Look what I found.
can I hold it?
maybe it's a puzzle.
maybe it's something magical.
Yeah. Yeah.
you know why zedd suggested we go back to cowley glen, don't you?
sure. He's hoping our friends there have heard something about darken rahl's movements.
there's a lot of places where we might get that information.
but only one place where the elder's wife makes zedd's favorite rabbit stew.
he asked me to get the recipe.
so we're tramping up this mountain like a couple of pack mules to fill zedd's belly?
do you hear that?
I don't hear anything.
exactly.
not even birds.
dead.
all of them.
but how?
I don't know.
no weapons drawn.
there wasn't a fight.
by proclamation of lord darken rahl:
this is the fate of all those who give harbor and comfort to the seeker.
because they gave me food and shelter a few months ago?
Richard, darken rahl has been killing innocent people long before you got to the midlands.
from the tracks I saw, the the d'harans who attacked the settlement weren't on horseback.
those can't be the same ones.
tell me, friend, who is it I owe my life to?
then you must be kahlan amnell.
something wrong?
no, it's just that we've been fighting the d'harans for so long and now, to have the seeker and confessor standing with us...
it's an honor.
my name's garrick. I'm the leader of the resistance in this valley.
that one is still alive!
command me, confessor.
my name is carver dunn.
my unit was dispatched here from azarith.
Why? - The garrison at grayson needs reinforcements.
the rebels in this valley have been growing stronger every day.
Ah, I appreciate the compliment.
do you know what this is?
the soldiers call them whisperers.
the d'haran's have massacred four settlements in our valley.
my men have found cylinders at all of them.
do you know how they work?
a dark magic.
some say rahl's sorcerers have captured the voices of shadow people and bottled them inside the weapons.
when their screams are unleashed, they kill everyone within a league.
Rahl could wipe out every village in the midlands.
or terrify people into submission.
four attacks, all in this area.
they must be keeping these weapons somewhere nearby.
maybe at the fort near grayson?
all the compliance missions are dispatched from there.
compliance missions?
we'll have to get into the fort and destroy these weapons.
no, the fort can't be taken.
it's too big. Too many d'haran butchers.
or if we could steal just one of these whisperers, we could wipe out every soldier in the garrison.
you'll report as ordered, get one of the weapons, and bring it back to us
Yes, confessor, I'll try.
but I'm afraid I'll fail you.
Why? - Only certain soldiers are trusted with these weapons.
what kind of soldiers?
ones who enjoy killing.
well, then you'll have to steal the weapon.
I'll do anything to please you.
but I don't think I'm clever enough. I'll be caught.
Carver, have you ever been to this fort before?
no, I've never been away from my post at azarith.
then nobody here knows you?
no other soldiers were sent from azarith as reinforcements to grayson?
I don't think so.
what are you getting at, richard?
please, call me carver.
I'll report to the fort in his place, trick them into giving me a whisperer.
or steal it.
either way, we use it to wipe out the entire battalion.
the d'harans may be brutes, but they're not gullible.
you won't be able to bring your sword for protection.
and if they even suspect that you're an imposter
which is why I'll have to convince them I'm one of them.
name and rank?
archer third class,
only a confessor could get him to admit to a middle name like that.
keep going.
commanding officer? - Captain jandor.
attack position? - Third pentangle.
battle arms? - Twenty bolts.
wife's name? - Um... marta?
one mistake and you're dead.
you need to study more.
the longer we wait, the more time the d'harans have to massacre more people.
I'm ready now.
not quite yet.
blacksmith, it's time.
I'll do it.
you're sure?
I've had worse.
I'm archer dunn.
my unit was attacked by the rebels.
I'm the only survivor.
that's a very unfortunate story, archer dunn.
Dunn," there you are.
the rebels who killed my friends,
I wanna make them pay.
assign me to a new patrol so I can go after them.
you already had your chance to fight, but you abandoned your duty.
you should have fought to the death.
I'm worth more to darken rahl alive than I am as a corpse, trust me.
haven't you heard, soldier?
lord rahl has issued new orders.
he wants to send a clear message to our enemies.
d'harans always fight to the death.
cowards will not be tolerated.
you'll be executed.
I wanna talk to the commander.
shut him up.
he's going to want to hear this.
you're making a big mistake!
gag him.
I have information about the rebels.
if he has something to say,
I'll hear it.
but it better be good.
what do you know about the rebels?
after they ambushed us, the cowards fled back into the woods.
I tracked them there.
I can take you to where they're hiding.
did you know this? - He didn't say anything.
if you ask me, he's just trying to save himself.
I told him I wanted the bastards to pay for killing my friends.
he didn't give me a chance to say more.
he abandoned his unit.
there are no excep-- - I don't need you to quote regulations to me, sergeant.
tell us the location of the rebels.
I'll send my men to find out if you're telling the truth.
lock him in the stockade till they get back.
this d'haran's your new cellmate, dror.
he's a coward, but he told us what we've been trying to beat out of you for weeks:
where to find your rebel friends.
you'd better pray he's lying, dror, because if we find your friends then we won't need you anymore.
except to use your head to decorate a pole.
d'haran pig.
rebel scum.
trust me, I gave them the right information.
your friends are as good as dead.
and so are you.
we'll give richard three days.
if he's not back by then, we'll need a plan to get him out.
they store supply wagons outside the gate, here.
and if we set them on fire, maybe that would draw enough attention for one of us to slip in and find the seeker.
confessor.
is there anything I can do for you?
when I need you, I'll let you know.
Yes, confessor.
is there something else?
I feel guilty.
because you've been confessed.
no, no, confessor. I felt this way for a long time.
long before you used your power on me.
it's about the things I did, fighting for darken rahl.
give us a moment.
I'm listening.
first,
I haven't sent any of my pay back to my wife in azarith.
I gambled it away at dice.
you'll need to make up for that.
Yes, confessor, I will.
there's something else?
before I was conscripted into the army
I was a cook for a lord in our village.
it's all I ever wanted to do.
I never wanted to do anything else.
but rahl needed every healthy man, so I was forced to join the army.
confessor, I did terrible things.
I went on raids, even against civilians.
I burned houses.
I hurt people.
Yeah, I kill
I ki-- I killed some.
well, that's what d'haran soldiers do.
no, I didn't have to.
I could have run.
the night before we raided araban, my friend kerwin deserted.
he asked me to go with him but I didn'T.
I was too afraid.
well, you're not a soldier anymore.
maybe we can find a way for you to do some good now.
you lied. You sent us into an empty clearing.
you could have gotten us killed ust to save your own skin.
you probably tramped in there like a pack of boars and the rebels heard you.
I can track better than anyone in this camp.
there wasn't a fire pit, wasn't even a snot rag.
there was never anyone there.
I would've found them.
you know what I think, sergeant?
you didn't wanna find the rebels.
because if you found them, you would've had to fight them.
Yeah, get him!
these men are cowards.
they can't track. They can't fight.
and if you don't want those rebels to kill you all, you need a man like me.
those men you just bloodied are my best soldiers.
all three of them are your superiors.
sir, it's not my fault they couldn't take advantage of the information I gave them.
every good woodsman knows a noisy hunter never catches his prey.
I don't trust anyone in this fort.
they're all schemers, liars, thugs.
you probably are too.
this is a very dangerous post.
the most dangerous in the midlands.
every day the rebels get more aggressive.
every time we step outside this fort our lives are at great risk.
so more than anything, what I need are men who can fight.
so maybe you are right.
maybe I could use a man like you.
sir, the men say you've got whisperers in this fort.
give me one and let me kill some rebels.
you got nerve, dunn. But you need to slow down.
I'm going on a mission tomorrow.
I need a man to go with me.
prove yourself, then maybe I'll let you have your revenge.
no one goes past you.
Yes, sir.
whoa. Off limits.
comfortable with your new weapon?
well, it's not the sword of truth, is it?
but it'll do.
Dunn's getting closer to the captain than a fly on a cow's ass.
ask around. See if anyone knows anything about him.
everyone's got a weakness.
when I find out what dunn's is,
I'm gonna crush him.
look at that. Elk tracks. Heh.
I'd say he was 600 stone.
eight hundred.
they're fresh.
he knows we're here.
how can you tell?
see how his hoof pivots a little as he caught our scent.
he ran off into the brush there.
if only we'd been downwind, might have had venison for supper.
sir, if I may, what's our objective on this mission?
you wanted to know our objective, dunn.
there it is.
Grayson.
ready to do your duty, soldier?
is that family aiding the rebels?
and if they are?
I'm ready to do whatever's necessary, sir.
well, you're a hard man, dunn. I like that.
but we're not going to kill them.
we're going to feed them.
sir? - They're my family.
look what your father's brought you!
the last chicken in the midlands!
it's too dangerous for a soldier to travel alone in these parts, dunn.
too many rebels who'd like nothing better than the ears of a d'haran captain to adorn their trophy belts.
that's why I had to bring you along. - Yes, sir.
food's hard to come by in grayson these days.
it's the last loyalist village in the valley.
the rebels are all over the trade roads.
so from time to time,
I requisition supplies for my family, courtesy of lord rahl.
naturally, it's against regulation to visit your family except on leave.
that's why I requested a posting near grayson.
of course, I'm not on leave, am I?
but I know all the other men at the fort.
they talk.
I can count on you not to say anything about this to the higher-ups, can't I, dunn?
I can keep a secret, sir.
if you don't, I can always hand you back to sergeant frye.
sorry, son.
your clumsy dad didn't mean to scare you like that.
I'm sorry.
Tanner jumps at every loud noise lately.
if I drop something, or a wagon passes.
the war's been hard on him.
he's afraid there'll be more fighting.
fighting? Here?
a few months ago rebels attacked our village.
he saw some people killed.
his best friend's house was burned to the ground.
do you have a wife, carver?
her name's maris.
she's in azarith.
she must worry about you.
soldiers forget how hard war is on their families.
Yes, ma'am, maybe we do.
confessor, I found some blackberries, and I made these for you.
I usually use butter, but I could only find lard.
mm, it's delicious. - There's more.
that's plenty for me.
give them to the others.
uh, confessor, can I have a word?
what's he still doing here?
he's not making any trouble.
my men don't like it.
it's not up to them, is it?
forgive me, confessor, but some of these men have had their homes burned and their families killed.
do you know what the d'harans do when they capture one of us?
we aren't d'harans.
they torture him and then they publicly execute him as an example to anyone else thinking of joining the fight against rahl.
now, my men think we should do the same to dunn, so the d'harans fear us like they want us to fear them.
do your people want justice or revenge?
this is a magic whistle.
if you're ever afraid of anything, a noise, something in the dark, you just play the whistle and you won't feel scared anymore.
go ahead, try it.
Carver, that's the first time he's smiled in three months.
I'm so grateful my husband has a friend like you to watch out for him now.
sir?
there's something that's been weighing on my mind.
can I tell you the truth?
what is it?
your chicken was much too spicy.
I appreciate the honesty, dunn.
and I appreciate what you did for my son.
what the rebels did to him, your village, my comrades,
I wanna make them pay.
sir, I think it's time you gave me a whisperer and let me go after them.
I can't do that.
but I've showed you I can fight, I can track.
I can be trusted.
I am beginning to trust you, dunn.
I'm afraid we've run out of whisperers.
sir? - Relax, dunn.
a shipment's on its way from d'hara, should arrive tomorrow.
isn't it too dangerous taking the weapons through rebel territory?
that's why they're being transported at night.
but even at night the open roads can be dangerous.
the rebels will never see them.
they're going through the rekuna pass.
I have orders to question the prisoner.
I didn't get any orders.
you're right. I don't have any orders.
but that rebel scum spit on me, insulted my friends.
I want a piece of him.
thought you might like to give me a hand.
got a visitor, dror.
your old cellmate, come to pay his respects.
what are you doing? - I'm helping you escape.
Why? - Because I'm on your side.
I'm the seeker.
I'm sorry about how I treated you before.
I needed the d'harans to think I was one of them.
now, I want you to go back and find garrick.
you know my brother?
we're working together to stop the massacres.
you might need this.
how do I know this isn't a trick, so you can follow me back, kill my friends?
because I already know where they are.
a cave, about 600 paces southwest of the river crossing.
I need you to tell your brother a shipment of whisperers is coming through the rekuna pass tonight.
if he acts fast, he can capture them.
if you're the seeker, why not go after the weapons yourself?
because if I don't make bed check, the d'harans will think I deserted and send a search party.
but the next guard doesn't come on duty until dawn.
if you go now, you can reach garrick and intercept the shipment before anyone knows you're missing.
get his uniform on.
I'll try to slip away and meet up with you the first chance I get.
come on.
you're late, dunn.
I'm gonna have to report you to the captain.
no need. I was just with him.
and he gave me this to share with my comrades.
pays to make friends with the right people.
plenty for everyone.
don't shoot! It's me, dror.
Dror? I thought you were dead.
only taken prisoner.
the seeker helped me escape.
it's good to see you, brother.
we've got work to do.
who's the new man?
confessed d'haran.
the one the seeker is impersonating.
let's move out!
confessor.
I wanna go with you and fight the d'harans.
I wanna make up for the things I've done.
no. No more killing for you.
just stay here and make something to eat.
the men will be hungry when we get back.
Yes, confessor. I
rebel prisoner's escaped.
I need men for a search party.
I'll find him, sir.
captain, wait. - Not now, sergeant.
sorry, sir.
but you'll wanna hear this.
tell the captain what you told me.
I was posted at azarith two summers ago.
I met archer dunn there.
and that's not him.
I remember dunn because another soldier at azarith deserted.
a friend of his.
the officers suspected dunn helped the man escape, but the other archers in dunn's unit convinced the officers that wasn't possible.
why not? - Well, dunn was too timid.
he was too scared to even snicker when the other men were mocking the officers behind their backs.
they called him "mouse.
he was a laughingstock.
that was two summers ago.
maybe your memory's cloudy.
no, sir. I remember dunn clear as day.
scrawny with yellow hair.
confessor? Did you get the weapons?
I'm glad.
torben the blacksmith was killed.
I'm sorry.
would you like something to eat?
get away from me!
I'm sorry for the loss of your friend.
you're sorry?
you're one of them, you d'haran bastard!
missing
confessor, thank you for giving me another chance.
he's dead.
this is ridiculous,
I never saw this soldier before, not in azarith or anywhere else.
you're calling voss a liar?
sir, you know frye hates me.
I thrashed him in front of his men, humiliated him.
he ordered this soldier to make these accusations because he wants revenge.
a liar's excuse.
I am doing my duty:
protecting against an infiltrator and serving darken rahl.
captain, this man is an imposter, maybe even a spy.
it's time for him to get four arrows in his chest.
you two are dismissed.
but, captain-- - don't push me, sergeant.
move.
you're confinedto the garrison till I get to the truth of this.
it was cold-blooded murder.
dror must be punished.
you think I'm going to let you punish my own brother for killing a d'haran?
after what those pigs did to him in their stockade, after they killed so many of our people.
it wasn't carver who tortured your brother or killed your friends.
he was a soldier in rahl's army, wasn't he?
he was confessed.
he was a changed man.
and he wasn't even armed.
it's my duty as a confessor to bring his killer to justice.
I'm not going to let that happen.
we have the weapons.
there's no need for richard to spend another minute in that garrison.
we need to get him out.
not yet.
we still have time before the d'harans realize they've been robbed.
pack up the whisperers.
we're going to pay a little visit to the good citizens of grayson village.
Why? - Grayson is filled with loyalists.
let's see how they like it when rahl's dark magic is used against them.
those people are civilians.
you use the weapons against them and you're no better than rahl.
I won't let you do it.
stay out of our way, confessor.
I wanna believe you.
your instincts are sharp, sir.
don't try to flatter me, dunn.
swear to me on your father's soul that you're telling the truth.
I swear.
I trusted you.
I brought you home to meet my family, even thought we could be friends, if that's possible in this cursed place.
so if you're lying to me,
I won't send you to the crossbows.
I'll kill you myself.
captain. Dunn's wife is here.
his wife?
Yes, sir, she's outside the gate, very agitated.
claims she walked for days from azarith to find her husband.
says he left her destitute.
insists on seeing him, sir.
sir, I know that's against regulations, send her away.
you see, sir?
anyone else in this garrison would murder his bunkmate just for the chance to smell his woman's skin.
when she sees this man isn't her husband, it'll prove he's a liar.
let's find out.
you abandoned me.
you haven't sent a penny home for your children.
how do you expect us to survive?
you shouldn't have come here.
don't they pay you?
how much does he earn?
well, ma'am, he's only beexz.
well, he hasn't sent me money for months.
you selfish wench.
who's watching our children while you're chasing after me?
captain, I'm sorry about this.
let me get rid of her.
may have made quick work of you, sergeant, but I don't think carver dunn is any match for his wife.
wench? - You started it. Did you have to hit me so hard?
Richard, we have to get out of here.
Garrick's captured the whisperers and he's going to use them to attack grayson.
the village? It's full of innocent women and children. Why?
revenge.
the captain's family lives there.
I have to warn him.
no. He'll know you're a spy.
go.
he's the seeker!
close the gates!
after them!
stop!
out of our way, seeker.
don't do this, garrick.
think about what we're fighting for, an end to all the suffering.
to stop us, you're gonna have to kill us.
keep moving!
take them all!
get out of here before they kill you all!
stop! Or everyone dies!
we're close enough to the village that all of those people will be on their way to the underworld too.
but I can still stop the whisperer from releasing its magic.
so if you wanna save those people, then retreat.
now.
all of you!
what's to stop you from killing them anyway once we're gone?
that's a chance you'll just have to take.
run!
you betrayed me.
but you're fighting the rebels. Why?
they were going to attack grayson.
why does the seeker care about a loyalist village?
my mission is to stop darken rahl, not kill innocent people.
thank you for saving my family.
but my duty is to serve lord rahl.
I don't wanna fight you.
then die where you stand.
no, stay back.
I could have used a man who can fight like you.
do your duty, seeker.
finish me.
go back to your family.
maybe we should have kept at least one of the weapons.
we could have used it to attack darken rahl.
nobody should have weapons like these.
too many innocent people have already died.
the d'haran captain wasn't innocent.
he would've killed you in a heartbeat if he had the chance.
he might still try again someday.
why did you let him go?
why did you try to protect carver dunn?
you be the hiders,
I'll be the seeker.
all right.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.
come out, everybody. Look what I found.
can I hold it?
maybe it's a puzzle.
maybe it's something magical.
Yeah. Yeah.
you know why Zedd suggested we go back to cowley glen, don't you?
sure. He's hoping our friends there have heard something about darken rahl's movements.
there's a lot of places where we might get that information.
but only one place where the elder's wife makes Zedd's favorite rabbit stew.
he asked me to get the recipe.
so we're tramping up this mountain like a couple of pack mules to fill Zedd's belly?
do you hear that?
I don't hear anything.
exactly.
not even birds.
dead.
all of them.
but how?
I don't know.
no weapons drawn.
there wasn't a fight.
by proclamation of lord darken rahl:
this is the fate of all those who give harbor and comfort to the seeker.
because they gave me food and shelter a few months ago?
Richard, darken rahl has been killing innocent people long before you got to the midlands.
from the tracks I saw, the d'harans who attacked the settlement weren't on horseback.
those can't be the same ones.
tell me, friend, who is it I owe my life to?
then you must be kahlan amnell.
something wrong?
no, it's just that we've been fighting the d'harans for so long and now, to have the seeker and confessor standing with us...
it's an honor.
my name's garrick. I'm the leader of the resistance in this valley.
that one is still alive!
command me, confessor.
my name is carver dunn.
my unit was dispatched here from azarith.
Why? - The garrison at grayson needs reinforcements.
the rebels in this valley have been growing stronger every day.
Ah, I appreciate the compliment.
do you know what this is?
the soldiers call them whisperers.
the d'haran's have massacred four settlements in our valley.
my men have found cylinders at all of them.
do you know how they work?
a dark magic.
some say rahl's sorcerers have captured the voices of shadow people and bottled them inside the weapons.
when their screams are unleashed, they kill everyone within a league.
Rahl could wipe out every village in the midlands.
or terrify people into submission.
four attacks, all in this area.
they must be keeping these weapons somewhere nearby.
maybe at the fort near grayson?
all the compliance missions are dispatched from there.
compliance missions?
we'll have to get into the fort and destroy these weapons.
no, the fort can't be taken.
it's too big. Too many d'haran butchers.
or if we could steal just one of these whisperers, we could wipe out every soldier in the garrison.
you'll report as ordered, get one of the weapons, and bring it back to us
Yes, confessor, I'll try.
but I'm afraid I'll fail you.
Why? - Only certain soldiers are trusted with these weapons.
what kind of soldiers?
ones who enjoy killing.
well, then you'll have to steal the weapon.
I'll do anything to please you.
but I don't think I'm clever enough. I'll be caught.
Carver, have you ever been to this fort before?
no, I've never been away from my post at azarith.
then nobody here knows you?
no other soldiers were sent from Azarith as reinforcements to Grayson?
I don't think so.
what are you getting at, richard?
please, call me carver.
I'll report to the fort in his place, trick them into giving me a whisperer.
or steal it.
either way, we use it to wipe out the entire battalion.
the d'harans may be brutes, but they're not gullible.
you won't be able to bring your sword for protection.
and if they even suspect that you're an imposter
which is why I'll have to convince them I'm one of them.
name and rank?
archer third class,
only a confessor could get him to admit to a middle name like that.
keep going.
commanding officer? - Captain jandor.
attack position? - Third pentangle.
battle arms? - Twenty bolts.
wife's name? - Um... marta?
one mistake and you're dead.
you need to study more.
the longer we wait, the more time the d'harans have to massacre more people.
I'm ready now.
not quite yet.
blacksmith, it's time.
I'll do it.
you're sure?
I've had worse.
I'm archer Dunn.
my unit was attacked by the rebels.
I'm the only survivor.
that's a very unfortunate story, archer dunn.
dunn, there you are.
the rebels who killed my friends,
I wanna make them pay.
assign me to a new patrol so I can go after them.
you already had your chance to fight, but you abandoned your duty.
you should have fought to the death.
I'm worth more to Darken Rahl alive than I am as a corpse, trust me.
haven't you heard, soldier?
lord Rahl has issued new orders.
he wants to send a clear message to our enemies.
d'harans always fight to the death.
cowards will not be tolerated.
you'll be executed.
I wanna talk to the commander.
shut him up.
he's going to want to hear this.
you're making a big mistake!
gag him.
I have information about the rebels.
if he has something to say,
I'll hear it.
but it better be good.
what do you know about the rebels?
after they ambushed us, the cowards fled back into the woods.
I tracked them there.
I can take you to where they're hiding.
did you know this? - He didn't say anything.
if you ask me, he's just trying to save himself.
I told him I wanted the bastards to pay for killing my friends.
he didn't give me a chance to say more.
he abandoned his unit.
there are no excep-- - I don't need you to quote regulations to me, sergeant.
tell us the location of the rebels.
I'll send my men to find out if you're telling the truth.
lock him in the stockade till they get back.
this d'haran's your new cellmate, Dror.
he's a coward, but he told us what we've been trying to beat out of you for weeks:
where to find your rebel friends.
you'd better pray he's lying, Dror, because if we find your friends then we won't need you anymore.
except to use your head to decorate a pole.
d'haran pig.
rebel scum.
trust me, I gave them the right information.
your friends are as good as dead.
and so are you.
we'll give richard three days.
if he's not back by then, we'll need a plan to get him out.
they store supply wagons outside the gate, here.
and if we set them on fire, maybe that would draw enough attention for one of us to slip in and find the seeker.
confessor.
is there anything I can do for you?
when I need you, I'll let you know.
Yes, confessor.
is there something else?
I feel guilty.
because you've been confessed.
no, no, confessor. I felt this way for a long time.
long before you used your power on me.
it's about the things I did, fighting for darken Rahl.
give us a moment.
I'm listening.
first,
I haven't sent any of my pay back to my wife in Azarith.
I gambled it away at dice.
you'll need to make up for that.
Yes, confessor, I will.
there's something else?
before I was conscripted into the army
I was a cook for a lord in our village.
it's all I ever wanted to do.
I never wanted to do anything else.
but Rahl needed every healthy man, so I was forced to join the army.
confessor, I did terrible things.
I went on raids, even against civilians.
I burned houses.
I hurt people.
Yeah, I kill
I ki-- I killed some.
well, that's what d'haran soldiers do.
no, I didn't have to.
I could have run.
the night before we raided Araban, my friend Kerwin deserted.
he asked me to go with him but I didn't.
I was too afraid.
well, you're not a soldier anymore.
maybe we can find a way for you to do some good now.
you lied. You sent us into an empty clearing.
you could have gotten us killed us to save your own skin.
you probably tramped in there like a pack of boars and the rebels heard you.
I can track better than anyone in this camp.
there wasn't a fire pit, wasn't even a snot rag.
there was never anyone there.
I would've found them.
you know what I think, sergeant?
you didn't wanna find the rebels.
you would've had to fight them.
Yeah, get him!
these men are cowards.
they can't track. They can't fight.
and if you don't want those rebels to kill you all, you need a man like me.
those men you just bloodied are my best soldiers.
all three of them are your superiors.
sir, it's not my fault they couldn't take advantage of the information I gave them.
every good woodsman knows a noisy hunter never catches his prey.
I don't trust anyone in this fort.
they're all schemers, liars, thugs.
you probably are too.
this is a very dangerous post.
the most dangerous in the midlands.
every day the rebels get more aggressive.
every time we step outside this fort our lives are at great risk.
so more than anything, what I need are men who can fight.
so maybe you are right.
maybe I could use a man like you.
sir, the men say you've got whisperers in this fort.
give me one and let me kill some rebels.
you got nerve, Dunn. But you need to slow down.
I'm going on a mission tomorrow.
I need a man to go with me.
prove yourself, then maybe I'll let you have your revenge.
no one goes past you.
Yes, sir.
whoa. Off limits.
comfortable with your new weapon?
well, it's not the sword of truth, is it?
but it'll do.
Dunn's getting closer to the captain than a fly on a cow's ass.
ask around. See if anyone knows anything about him.
everyone's got a weakness.
when I find out what Dunn's is,
I'm gonna crush him.
look at that. Elk tracks. Heh.
I'd say he was 600 stone.
eight hundred.
they're fresh.
he knows we're here.
how can you tell?
see how his hoof pivots a little as he caught our scent.
he ran off into the brush there.
if only we'd been downwind, might have had venison for supper.
sir, if I may, what's our objective on this mission?
you wanted to know our objective, Dunn.
there it is.
Grayson.
ready to do your duty, soldier?
is that family aiding the rebels?
and if they are?
I'm ready to do whatever's necessary, sir.
well, you're a hard man, Dunn. I like that.
but we're not going to kill them.
we're going to feed them.
sir? - They're my family.
look what your father's brought you!
the last chicken in the midlands!
it's too dangerous for a soldier to travel alone in these parts, Dunn.
too many rebels who'd like nothing better than the ears of a d'haran captain to adorn their trophy belts.
that's why I had to bring you along. - Yes, sir.
food's hard to come by in grayson these days.
it's the last loyalist village in the valley.
the rebels are all over the trade roads.
so from time to time,
I requisition supplies for my family, courtesy of lord Rahl.
naturally, it's against regulation to visit your family except on leave.
that's why I requested a posting near grayson.
of course, I'm not on leave, am I?
but I know all the other men at the fort.
they talk.
I can count on you not to say anything about this to the higher-ups, can't I, Dunn?
I can keep a secret, sir.
if you don't, I can always hand you back to sergeant Frye.
sorry, son.
your clumsy dad didn't mean to scare you like that.
I'm sorry.
Tanner jumps at every loud noise lately.
if I drop something, or a wagon passes.
the war's been hard on him.
he's afraid there'll be more fighting.
fighting? Here?
a few months ago rebels attacked our village.
he saw some people killed.
his best friend's house was burned to the ground.
do you have a wife, Carver?
her name's Maris.
she's in Azarith.
she must worry about you.
soldiers forget how hard war is on their families.
Yes, ma'am, maybe we do.
confessor, I found some blackberries, and I made these for you.
I usually use butter, but I could only find lard.
mm, it's delicious. - There's more.
that's plenty for me.
give them to the others.
uh, confessor, can I have a word?
what's he still doing here?
he's not making any trouble.
my men don't like it.
it's not up to them, is it?
forgive me, confessor, but some of these men have had their homes burned and their families killed.
do you know what the d'harans do when they capture one of us?
we aren't d'harans.
they torture him and then they publicly execute him as an example to anyone else thinking of joining the fight against Rahl.
now, my men think we should do the same to Dunn, so the d'harans fear us like they want us to fear them.
do your people want justice or revenge?
this is a magic whistle.
if you're ever afraid of anything, a noise, something in the dark, you just play the whistle and you won't feel scared anymore.
go ahead, try it.
Carver, that's the first time he's smiled in three months.
I'm so grateful my husband has a friend like you to watch out for him now.
sir?
there's something that's been weighing on my mind.
can I tell you the truth?
what is it?
your chicken was much too spicy.
I appreciate the honesty, Dunn.
and I appreciate what you did for my son.
what the rebels did to him, your village, my comrades,
I wanna make them pay.
sir, I think it's time you gave me a whisperer and let me go after them.
I can't do that.
but I've showed you I can fight, I can track.
I can be trusted.
I am beginning to trust you, Dunn.
I'm afraid we've run out of whisperers.
sir? - Relax, Dunn.
a shipment's on its way from d'hara, should arrive tomorrow.
isn't it too dangerous taking the weapons through rebel territory?
that's why they're being transported at night.
but even at night the open roads can be dangerous.
the rebels will never see them.
they're going through the rekuna pass.
I have orders to question the prisoner.
I didn't get any orders.
you're right. I don't have any orders.
but that rebel scum spit on me, insulted my friends.
I want a piece of him.
thought you might like to give me a hand.
got a visitor, Dror.
your old cellmate, come to pay his respects.
what are you doing? - I'm helping you escape.
Why? - Because I'm on your side.
I'm the seeker.
I'm sorry about how I treated you before.
I needed the d'harans to think I was one of them.
now, I want you to go back and find garrick.
you know my brother?
we're working together to stop the massacres.
you might need this.
how do I know this isn't a trick, so you can follow me back, kill my friends?
because I already know where they are.
a cave, about 600 paces southwest of the river crossing.
I need you to tell your brother a shipment of whisperers is coming through the rekuna pass tonight.
if he acts fast, he can capture them.
if you're the seeker, why not go after the weapons yourself?
because if I don't make bed check, the d'harans will think I deserted and send a search party.
but the next guard doesn't come on duty until dawn.
if you go now, you can reach garrick and intercept the shipment before anyone knows you're missing.
get his uniform on.
I'll try to slip away and meet up with you the first chance I get.
come on.
you're late, Dunn.
I'm gonna have to report you to the captain.
no need. I was just with him.
and he gave me this to share with my comrades.
pays to make friends with the right people.
plenty for everyone.
don't shoot! It's me, Dror.
Dror? I thought you were dead.
only taken prisoner.
the seeker helped me escape.
it's good to see you, brother.
we've got work to do.
who's the new man?
confessed d'haran.
the one the seeker is impersonating.
let's move out!
confessor.
I wanna go with you and fight the d'harans.
I wanna make up for the things I've done.
no. No more killing for you.
just stay here and make something to eat.
the men will be hungry when we get back.
Yes, confessor. I
rebel prisoner's escaped.
I need men for a search party.
I'll find him, sir.
captain, wait. - Not now, sergeant.
sorry, sir.
but you'll wanna hear this.
tell the captain what you told me.
I was posted at Azarith two summers ago.
I met archer Dunn there.
and that's not him.
I remember Dunn because another soldier at Azarith deserted.
a friend of his.
the officers suspected Dunn helped the man escape, but the other archers in dunn's unit convinced the officers that wasn't possible.
why not? - Well, Dunn was too timid.
he was too scared to even snicker when the other men were mocking the officers behind their backs.
they called him "mouse."
he was a laughingstock.
that was two summers ago.
maybe your memory's cloudy.
no, sir. I remember Dunn clear as day.
scrawny with yellow hair.
confessor? Did you get the weapons?
I'm glad.
torben the blacksmith was killed.
I'm sorry.
would you like something to eat?
get away from me!
I'm sorry for the loss of your friend.
you're sorry?
you're one of them, you d'haran bastard!
missing
confessor, thank you for giving me another chance.
he's dead.
this is ridiculous,
I never saw this soldier before, not in Azarith or anywhere else.
you're calling Voss a liar?
sir, you know Frye hates me.
I thrashed him in front of his men, humiliated him.
he ordered this soldier to make these accusations because he wants revenge.
a liar's excuse.
I am doing my duty:
protecting against an infiltrator and serving darken Rahl.
captain, this man is an imposter, maybe even a spy.
it's time for him to get four arrows in his chest.
you two are dismissed.
but, captain-- - don't push me, sergeant.
move.
you're confined to the garrison till I get to the truth of this.
it was cold-blooded murder.
dror must be punished.
you think I'm going to let you punish my own brother for killing a d'haran?
after what those pigs did to him in their stockade, after they killed so many of our people.
it wasn't Carver who tortured your brother or killed your friends.
he was a soldier in Rahl's army, wasn't he?
he was confessed.
he was a changed man.
and he wasn't even armed.
it's my duty as a confessor to bring his killer to justice.
I'm not going to let that happen.
we have the weapons.
there's no need for Richard to spend another minute in that garrison.
we need to get him out.
not yet.
we still have time before the d'harans realize they've been robbed.
pack up the whisperers.
we're going to pay a little visit to the good citizens of grayson village.
Why? - Grayson is filled with loyalists.
let's see how they like it when Rahl's dark magic is used against them.
those people are civilians.
you use the weapons against them and you're no better than rahl.
I won't let you do it.
stay out of our way, confessor.
I wanna believe you.
your instincts are sharp, sir.
don't try to flatter me, Dunn.
swear to me on your father's soul that you're telling the truth.
I swear.
I trusted you.
I brought you home to meet my family, even thought we could be friends, if that's possible in this cursed place.
so if you're lying to me,
I won't send you to the crossbows.
I'll kill you myself.
captain. Dunn's wife is here.
his wife?
Yes, sir, she's outside the gate, very agitated.
claims she walked for days from azarith to find her husband.
says he left her destitute.
insists on seeing him, sir.
sir, I know that's against regulations, send her away.
you see, sir?
anyone else in this garrison would murder his bunkmate just for the chance to smell his woman's skin.
when she sees this man isn't her husband, it'll prove he's a liar.
let's find out.
you abandoned me.
you haven't sent a penny home for your children.
how do you expect us to survive?
you shouldn't have come here.
don't they pay you?
how much does he earn?
well, ma'am, he's only beexz.
well, he hasn't sent me money for months.
you selfish wench.
who's watching our children while you're chasing after me?
captain, I'm sorry about this.
let me get rid of her.
may have made quick work of you, sergeant, but I don't think Carver Dunn is any match for his wife.
wench? - You started it. Did you have to hit me so hard?
Richard, we have to get out of here.
Garrick's captured the whisperers and he's going to use them to attack grayson.
the village? It's full of innocent women and children. Why?
revenge.
the captain's family lives there.
I have to warn him.
no. He'll know you're a spy.
go.
he's the seeker!
close the gates!
after them!
stop!
out of our way, seeker.
don't do this, Garrick.
think about what we're fighting for, an end to all the suffering.
to stop us, you're gonna have to kill us.
keep moving!
take them all!
get out of here before they kill you all!
stop! Or everyone dies!
we're close enough to the village that all of those people will be on their way to the underworld too.
but I can still stop the whisperer from releasing its magic.
so if you wanna save those people, then retreat.
now.
all of you!
what's to stop you from killing them anyway once we're gone?
that's a chance you'll just have to take.
run!
you betrayed me.
but you're fighting the rebels. Why?
they were going to attack grayson.
why does the seeker care about a loyalist village?
my mission is to stop Darken Rahl, not kill innocent people.
thank you for saving my family.
but my duty is to serve Lord Rahl.
I don't wanna fight you.
then die where you stand.
no, stay back.
I could have used a man who can fight like you.
do your duty, seeker.
finish me.
go back to your family.
maybe we should have kept at least one of the weapons.
we could have used it to attack Darken Rahl.
nobody should have weapons like these.
too many innocent people have already died.
the d'haran captain wasn't innocent.
he would've killed you in a heartbeat if he had the chance.
he might still try again someday.
why did you let him go?
why did you try to protect Carver Dunn?
you be the hiders,
I'll be the seeker.
all right.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.
come out, everybody. Look what I found.
can I hold it?
maybe it's a puzzle.
maybe it's something magical.
Yeah. Yeah.
you know why Zedd suggested we go back to cowley glen, don't you?
sure. He's hoping our friends there have heard something about darken rahl's movements.
there's a lot of places where we might get that information.
but only one place where the elder's wife makes Zedd's favorite rabbit stew.
he asked me to get the recipe.
so we're tramping up this mountain like a couple of pack mules to fill Zedd's belly?
do you hear that?
I don't hear anything.
exactly.
not even birds.
dead.
all of them.
but how?
I don't know.
no weapons drawn.
there wasn't a fight.
by proclamation of lord darken rahl:
this is the fate of all those who give harbor and comfort to the seeker.
because they gave me food and shelter a few months ago?
Richard, darken rahl has been killing innocent people long before you got to the midlands.
from the tracks I saw, the d'harans who attacked the settlement weren't on horseback.
those can't be the same ones.
tell me, friend, who is it I owe my life to?
then you must be kahlan amnell.
something wrong?
no, it's just that we've been fighting the d'harans for so long and now, to have the seeker and confessor standing with us...
it's an honor.
my name's garrick. I'm the leader of the resistance in this valley.
that one is still alive!
command me, confessor.
my name is carver dunn.
my unit was dispatched here from azarith.
Why? - The garrison at grayson needs reinforcements.
the rebels in this valley have been growing stronger every day.
Ah, I appreciate the compliment.
do you know what this is?
the soldiers call them whisperers.
the d'haran's have massacred four settlements in our valley.
my men have found cylinders at all of them.
do you know how they work?
a dark magic.
some say rahl's sorcerers have captured the voices of shadow people and bottled them inside the weapons.
when their screams are unleashed, they kill everyone within a league.
Rahl could wipe out every village in the midlands.
or terrify people into submission.
four attacks, all in this area.
they must be keeping these weapons somewhere nearby.
maybe at the fort near grayson?
all the compliance missions are dispatched from there.
compliance missions?
we'll have to get into the fort and destroy these weapons.
no, the fort can't be taken.
it's too big. Too many d'haran butchers.
or if we could steal just one of these whisperers, we could wipe out every soldier in the garrison.
you'll report as ordered, get one of the weapons, and bring it back to us
Yes, confessor, I'll try.
but I'm afraid I'll fail you.
Why? - Only certain soldiers are trusted with these weapons.
what kind of soldiers?
ones who enjoy killing.
well, then you'll have to steal the weapon.
I'll do anything to please you.
but I don't think I'm clever enough. I'll be caught.
Carver, have you ever been to this fort before?
no, I've never been away from my post at azarith.
then nobody here knows you?
no other soldiers were sent from Azarith as reinforcements to Grayson?
I don't think so.
what are you getting at, richard?
please, call me carver.
I'll report to the fort in his place, trick them into giving me a whisperer.
or steal it.
either way, we use it to wipe out the entire battalion.
the d'harans may be brutes, but they're not gullible.
you won't be able to bring your sword for protection.
and if they even suspect that you're an imposter
which is why I'll have to convince them I'm one of them.
name and rank?
archer third class,
only a confessor could get him to admit to a middle name like that.
keep going.
commanding officer? - Captain jandor.
attack position? - Third pentangle.
battle arms? - Twenty bolts.
wife's name? - Um... marta?
one mistake and you're dead.
you need to study more.
the longer we wait, the more time the d'harans have to massacre more people.
I'm ready now.
not quite yet.
blacksmith, it's time.
I'll do it.
you're sure?
I've had worse.
I'm archer Dunn.
my unit was attacked by the rebels.
I'm the only survivor.
that's a very unfortunate story, archer dunn.
dunn, there you are.
the rebels who killed my friends,
I wanna make them pay.
assign me to a new patrol so I can go after them.
you already had your chance to fight, but you abandoned your duty.
you should have fought to the death.
I'm worth more to Darken Rahl alive than I am as a corpse, trust me.
haven't you heard, soldier?
lord Rahl has issued new orders.
he wants to send a clear message to our enemies.
d'harans always fight to the death.
cowards will not be tolerated.
you'll be executed.
I wanna talk to the commander.
shut him up.
he's going to want to hear this.
you're making a big mistake!
gag him.
I have information about the rebels.
if he has something to say,
I'll hear it.
but it better be good.
what do you know about the rebels?
after they ambushed us, the cowards fled back into the woods.
I tracked them there.
I can take you to where they're hiding.
did you know this? - He didn't say anything.
if you ask me, he's just trying to save himself.
I told him I wanted the bastards to pay for killing my friends.
he didn't give me a chance to say more.
he abandoned his unit.
there are no excep-- - I don't need you to quote regulations to me, sergeant.
tell us the location of the rebels.
I'll send my men to find out if you're telling the truth.
lock him in the stockade till they get back.
this d'haran's your new cellmate, Dror.
he's a coward, but he told us what we've been trying to beat out of you for weeks:
where to find your rebel friends.
you'd better pray he's lying, Dror, because if we find your friends then we won't need you anymore.
except to use your head to decorate a pole.
d'haran pig.
rebel scum.
trust me, I gave them the right information.
your friends are as good as dead.
and so are you.
we'll give richard three days.
if he's not back by then, we'll need a plan to get him out.
they store supply wagons outside the gate, here.
and if we set them on fire, maybe that would draw enough attention for one of us to slip in and find the seeker.
confessor.
is there anything I can do for you?
when I need you, I'll let you know.
Yes, confessor.
is there something else?
I feel guilty.
because you've been confessed.
no, no, confessor. I felt this way for a long time.
long before you used your power on me.
it's about the things I did, fighting for darken Rahl.
give us a moment.
I'm listening.
first,
I haven't sent any of my pay back to my wife in Azarith.
I gambled it away at dice.
you'll need to make up for that.
Yes, confessor, I will.
there's something else?
before I was conscripted into the army
I was a cook for a lord in our village.
it's all I ever wanted to do.
I never wanted to do anything else.
but Rahl needed every healthy man, so I was forced to join the army.
confessor, I did terrible things.
I went on raids, even against civilians.
I burned houses.
I hurt people.
Yeah, I kill
I ki-- I killed some.
well, that's what d'haran soldiers do.
no, I didn't have to.
I could have run.
the night before we raided Araban, my friend Kerwin deserted.
he asked me to go with him but I didn't.
I was too afraid.
well, you're not a soldier anymore.
maybe we can find a way for you to do some good now.
you lied. You sent us into an empty clearing.
you could have gotten us killed us to save your own skin.
you probably tramped in there like a pack of boars and the rebels heard you.
I can track better than anyone in this camp.
there wasn't a fire pit, wasn't even a snot rag.
there was never anyone there.
I would've found them.
you know what I think, sergeant?
you didn't wanna find the rebels.
you would've had to fight them.
Yeah, get him!
these men are cowards.
they can't track. They can't fight.
and if you don't want those rebels to kill you all, you need a man like me.
those men you just bloodied are my best soldiers.
all three of them are your superiors.
sir, it's not my fault they couldn't take advantage of the information I gave them.
every good woodsman knows a noisy hunter never catches his prey.
I don't trust anyone in this fort.
they're all schemers, liars, thugs.
you probably are too.
this is a very dangerous post.
the most dangerous in the midlands.
every day the rebels get more aggressive.
every time we step outside this fort our lives are at great risk.
so more than anything, what I need are men who can fight.
so maybe you are right.
maybe I could use a man like you.
sir, the men say you've got whisperers in this fort.
give me one and let me kill some rebels.
you got nerve, Dunn. But you need to slow down.
I'm going on a mission tomorrow.
I need a man to go with me.
prove yourself, then maybe I'll let you have your revenge.
no one goes past you.
Yes, sir.
whoa. Off limits.
comfortable with your new weapon?
well, it's not the sword of truth, is it?
but it'll do.
Dunn's getting closer to the captain than a fly on a cow's ass.
ask around. See if anyone knows anything about him.
everyone's got a weakness.
when I find out what Dunn's is,
I'm gonna crush him.
look at that. Elk tracks. Heh.
I'd say he was 600 stone.
eight hundred.
they're fresh.
he knows we're here.
how can you tell?
see how his hoof pivots a little as he caught our scent.
he ran off into the brush there.
if only we'd been downwind, might have had venison for supper.
sir, if I may, what's our objective on this mission?
you wanted to know our objective, Dunn.
there it is.
Grayson.
ready to do your duty, soldier?
is that family aiding the rebels?
and if they are?
I'm ready to do whatever's necessary, sir.
well, you're a hard man, Dunn. I like that.
but we're not going to kill them.
we're going to feed them.
sir? - They're my family.
look what your father's brought you!
the last chicken in the midlands!
it's too dangerous for a soldier to travel alone in these parts, Dunn.
too many rebels who'd like nothing better than the ears of a d'haran captain to adorn their trophy belts.
that's why I had to bring you along. - Yes, sir.
food's hard to come by in grayson these days.
it's the last loyalist village in the valley.
the rebels are all over the trade roads.
so from time to time,
I requisition supplies for my family, courtesy of lord Rahl.
naturally, it's against regulation to visit your family except on leave.
that's why I requested a posting near grayson.
of course, I'm not on leave, am I?
but I know all the other men at the fort.
they talk.
I can count on you not to say anything about this to the higher-ups, can't I, Dunn?
I can keep a secret, sir.
if you don't, I can always hand you back to sergeant Frye.
sorry, son.
your clumsy dad didn't mean to scare you like that.
I'm sorry.
Tanner jumps at every loud noise lately.
if I drop something, or a wagon passes.
the war's been hard on him.
he's afraid there'll be more fighting.
fighting? Here?
a few months ago rebels attacked our village.
he saw some people killed.
his best friend's house was burned to the ground.
do you have a wife, Carver?
her name's Maris.
she's in Azarith.
she must worry about you.
soldiers forget how hard war is on their families.
Yes, ma'am, maybe we do.
confessor, I found some blackberries, and I made these for you.
I usually use butter, but I could only find lard.
mm, it's delicious. - There's more.
that's plenty for me.
give them to the others.
uh, confessor, can I have a word?
what's he still doing here?
he's not making any trouble.
my men don't like it.
it's not up to them, is it?
forgive me, confessor, but some of these men have had their homes burned and their families killed.
do you know what the d'harans do when they capture one of us?
we aren't d'harans.
they torture him and then they publicly execute him as an example to anyone else thinking of joining the fight against Rahl.
now, my men think we should do the same to Dunn, so the d'harans fear us like they want us to fear them.
do your people want justice or revenge?
this is a magic whistle.
if you're ever afraid of anything, a noise, something in the dark, you just play the whistle and you won't feel scared anymore.
go ahead, try it.
Carver, that's the first time he's smiled in three months.
I'm so grateful my husband has a friend like you to watch out for him now.
sir?
there's something that's been weighing on my mind.
can I tell you the truth?
what is it?
your chicken was much too spicy.
I appreciate the honesty, Dunn.
and I appreciate what you did for my son.
what the rebels did to him, your village, my comrades,
I wanna make them pay.
sir, I think it's time you gave me a whisperer and let me go after them.
I can't do that.
but I've showed you I can fight, I can track.
I can be trusted.
I am beginning to trust you, Dunn.
I'm afraid we've run out of whisperers.
sir? - Relax, Dunn.
a shipment's on its way from d'hara, should arrive tomorrow.
isn't it too dangerous taking the weapons through rebel territory?
that's why they're being transported at night.
but even at night the open roads can be dangerous.
the rebels will never see them.
they're going through the rekuna pass.
I have orders to question the prisoner.
I didn't get any orders.
you're right. I don't have any orders.
but that rebel scum spit on me, insulted my friends.
I want a piece of him.
thought you might like to give me a hand.
got a visitor, Dror.
your old cellmate, come to pay his respects.
what are you doing? - I'm helping you escape.
Why? - Because I'm on your side.
I'm the seeker.
I'm sorry about how I treated you before.
I needed the d'harans to think I was one of them.
now, I want you to go back and find garrick.
you know my brother?
we're working together to stop the massacres.
you might need this.
how do I know this isn't a trick, so you can follow me back, kill my friends?
because I already know where they are.
a cave, about 600 paces southwest of the river crossing.
I need you to tell your brother a shipment of whisperers is coming through the rekuna pass tonight.
if he acts fast, he can capture them.
if you're the seeker, why not go after the weapons yourself?
because if I don't make bed check, the d'harans will think I deserted and send a search party.
but the next guard doesn't come on duty until dawn.
if you go now, you can reach garrick and intercept the shipment before anyone knows you're missing.
get his uniform on.
I'll try to slip away and meet up with you the first chance I get.
come on.
you're late, Dunn.
I'm gonna have to report you to the captain.
no need. I was just with him.
and he gave me this to share with my comrades.
pays to make friends with the right people.
plenty for everyone.
don't shoot! It's me, Dror.
Dror? I thought you were dead.
only taken prisoner.
the seeker helped me escape.
it's good to see you, brother.
we've got work to do.
who's the new man?
confessed d'haran.
the one the seeker is impersonating.
let's move out!
confessor.
I wanna go with you and fight the d'harans.
I wanna make up for the things I've done.
no. No more killing for you.
just stay here and make something to eat.
the men will be hungry when we get back.
Yes, confessor. I
rebel prisoner's escaped.
I need men for a search party.
I'll find him, sir.
captain, wait. - Not now, sergeant.
sorry, sir.
but you'll wanna hear this.
tell the captain what you told me.
I was posted at Azarith two summers ago.
I met archer Dunn there.
and that's not him.
I remember Dunn because another soldier at Azarith deserted.
a friend of his.
the officers suspected Dunn helped the man escape, but the other archers in dunn's unit convinced the officers that wasn't possible.
why not? - Well, Dunn was too timid.
he was too scared to even snicker when the other men were mocking the officers behind their backs.
they called him "mouse."
he was a laughingstock.
that was two summers ago.
maybe your memory's cloudy.
no, sir. I remember Dunn clear as day.
scrawny with yellow hair.
confessor? Did you get the weapons?
I'm glad.
torben the blacksmith was killed.
I'm sorry.
would you like something to eat?
get away from me!
I'm sorry for the loss of your friend.
you're sorry?
you're one of them, you d'haran bastard!
missing
confessor, thank you for giving me another chance.
he's dead.
this is ridiculous,
I never saw this soldier before, not in Azarith or anywhere else.
you're calling Voss a liar?
sir, you know Frye hates me.
I thrashed him in front of his men, humiliated him.
he ordered this soldier to make these accusations because he wants revenge.
a liar's excuse.
I am doing my duty:
protecting against an infiltrator and serving darken Rahl.
captain, this man is an imposter, maybe even a spy.
it's time for him to get four arrows in his chest.
you two are dismissed.
but, captain-- - don't push me, sergeant.
move.
you're confined to the garrison till I get to the truth of this.
it was cold-blooded murder.
dror must be punished.
you think I'm going to let you punish my own brother for killing a d'haran?
after what those pigs did to him in their stockade, after they killed so many of our people.
it wasn't Carver who tortured your brother or killed your friends.
he was a soldier in Rahl's army, wasn't he?
he was confessed.
he was a changed man.
and he wasn't even armed.
it's my duty as a confessor to bring his killer to justice.
I'm not going to let that happen.
we have the weapons.
there's no need for Richard to spend another minute in that garrison.
we need to get him out.
not yet.
we still have time before the d'harans realize they've been robbed.
pack up the whisperers.
we're going to pay a little visit to the good citizens of grayson village.
Why? - Grayson is filled with loyalists.
let's see how they like it when Rahl's dark magic is used against them.
those people are civilians.
you use the weapons against them and you're no better than rahl.
I won't let you do it.
stay out of our way, confessor.
I wanna believe you.
your instincts are sharp, sir.
don't try to flatter me, Dunn.
swear to me on your father's soul that you're telling the truth.
I swear.
I trusted you.
I brought you home to meet my family, even thought we could be friends, if that's possible in this cursed place.
so if you're lying to me,
I won't send you to the crossbows.
I'll kill you myself.
captain. Dunn's wife is here.
his wife?
Yes, sir, she's outside the gate, very agitated.
claims she walked for days from azarith to find her husband.
says he left her destitute.
insists on seeing him, sir.
sir, I know that's against regulations, send her away.
you see, sir?
anyone else in this garrison would murder his bunkmate just for the chance to smell his woman's skin.
when she sees this man isn't her husband, it'll prove he's a liar.
let's find out.
you abandoned me.
you haven't sent a penny home for your children.
how do you expect us to survive?
you shouldn't have come here.
don't they pay you?
how much does he earn?
well, ma'am, he's only beexz.
well, he hasn't sent me money for months.
you selfish wench.
who's watching our children while you're chasing after me?
captain, I'm sorry about this.
let me get rid of her.
may have made quick work of you, sergeant, but I don't think Carver Dunn is any match for his wife.
wench? - You started it. Did you have to hit me so hard?
Richard, we have to get out of here.
Garrick's captured the whisperers and he's going to use them to attack grayson.
the village? It's full of innocent women and children. Why?
revenge.
the captain's family lives there.
I have to warn him.
no. He'll know you're a spy.
go.
he's the seeker!
close the gates!
after them!
stop!
out of our way, seeker.
don't do this, Garrick.
think about what we're fighting for, an end to all the suffering.
to stop us, you're gonna have to kill us.
keep moving!
take them all!
get out of here before they kill you all!
stop! Or everyone dies!
we're close enough to the village that all of those people will be on their way to the underworld too.
but I can still stop the whisperer from releasing its magic.
so if you wanna save those people, then retreat.
now.
all of you!
what's to stop you from killing them anyway once we're gone?
that's a chance you'll just have to take.
run!
you betrayed me.
but you're fighting the rebels. Why?
they were going to attack grayson.
why does the seeker care about a loyalist village?
my mission is to stop Darken Rahl, not kill innocent people.
thank you for saving my family.
but my duty is to serve Lord Rahl.
I don't wanna fight you.
then die where you stand.
no, stay back.
I could have used a man who can fight like you.
do your duty, seeker.
finish me.
go back to your family.
maybe we should have kept at least one of the weapons.
we could have used it to attack Darken Rahl.
nobody should have weapons like these.
too many innocent people have already died.
the d'haran captain wasn't innocent.
he would've killed you in a heartbeat if he had the chance.
he might still try again someday.
why did you let him go?
why did you try to protect Carver Dunn?
you be the hiders,
I'll be the seeker.
all right.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.
come out, everybody. Look what I found.
can I hold it?
maybe it's a puzzle.
maybe it's something magical.
Yeah. Yeah.
you know why Zedd suggested we go back to cowley glen, don't you?
sure. He's hoping our friends there have heard something about darken rahl's movements.
there's a lot of places where we might get that information.
but only one place where the elder's wife makes Zedd's favorite rabbit stew.
he asked me to get the recipe.
so we're tramping up this mountain like a couple of pack mules to fill Zedd's belly?
do you hear that?
I don't hear anything.
exactly.
not even birds.
dead.
all of them.
but how?
I don't know.
no weapons drawn.
there wasn't a fight.
by proclamation of lord darken rahl:
this is the fate of all those who give harbor and comfort to the seeker.
because they gave me food and shelter a few months ago?
Richard, darken rahl has been killing innocent people long before you got to the midlands.
from the tracks I saw, the d'harans who attacked the settlement weren't on horseback.
those can't be the same ones.
tell me, friend, who is it I owe my life to?
then you must be kahlan amnell.
something wrong?
no, it's just that we've been fighting the d'harans for so long and now, to have the seeker and confessor standing with us...
it's an honor.
my name's garrick. I'm the leader of the resistance in this valley.
that one is still alive!
command me, confessor.
my name is carver dunn.
my unit was dispatched here from azarith.
Why? - The garrison at grayson needs reinforcements.
the rebels in this valley have been growing stronger every day.
Ah, I appreciate the compliment.
do you know what this is?
the soldiers call them whisperers.
the d'haran's have massacred four settlements in our valley.
my men have found cylinders at all of them.
do you know how they work?
a dark magic.
some say rahl's sorcerers have captured the voices of shadow people and bottled them inside the weapons.
when their screams are unleashed, they kill everyone within a league.
Rahl could wipe out every village in the midlands.
or terrify people into submission.
four attacks, all in this area.
they must be keeping these weapons somewhere nearby.
maybe at the fort near grayson?
all the compliance missions are dispatched from there.
compliance missions?
we'll have to get into the fort and destroy these weapons.
no, the fort can't be taken.
it's too big. Too many d'haran butchers.
or if we could steal just one of these whisperers, we could wipe out every soldier in the garrison.
you'll report as ordered, get one of the weapons, and bring it back to us
Yes, confessor, I'll try.
but I'm afraid I'll fail you.
Why? - Only certain soldiers are trusted with these weapons.
what kind of soldiers?
ones who enjoy killing.
well, then you'll have to steal the weapon.
I'll do anything to please you.
but I don't think I'm clever enough. I'll be caught.
Carver, have you ever been to this fort before?
no, I've never been away from my post at azarith.
then nobody here knows you?
no other soldiers were sent from Azarith as reinforcements to Grayson?
I don't think so.
what are you getting at, richard?
please, call me carver.
I'll report to the fort in his place, trick them into giving me a whisperer.
or steal it.
either way, we use it to wipe out the entire battalion.
the d'harans may be brutes, but they're not gullible.
you won't be able to bring your sword for protection.
and if they even suspect that you're an imposter
which is why I'll have to convince them I'm one of them.
name and rank?
archer third class,
only a confessor could get him to admit to a middle name like that.
keep going.
commanding officer? - Captain jandor.
attack position? - Third pentangle.
battle arms? - Twenty bolts.
wife's name? - Um... marta?
one mistake and you're dead.
you need to study more.
the longer we wait, the more time the d'harans have to massacre more people.
I'm ready now.
not quite yet.
blacksmith, it's time.
I'll do it.
you're sure?
I've had worse.
I'm archer Dunn.
my unit was attacked by the rebels.
I'm the only survivor.
that's a very unfortunate story, archer dunn.
dunn, there you are.
the rebels who killed my friends,
I wanna make them pay.
assign me to a new patrol so I can go after them.
you already had your chance to fight, but you abandoned your duty.
you should have fought to the death.
I'm worth more to Darken Rahl alive than I am as a corpse, trust me.
haven't you heard, soldier?
lord Rahl has issued new orders.
he wants to send a clear message to our enemies.
d'harans always fight to the death.
cowards will not be tolerated.
you'll be executed.
I wanna talk to the commander.
shut him up.
he's going to want to hear this.
you're making a big mistake!
gag him.
I have information about the rebels.
if he has something to say,
I'll hear it.
but it better be good.
what do you know about the rebels?
after they ambushed us, the cowards fled back into the woods.
I tracked them there.
I can take you to where they're hiding.
did you know this? - He didn't say anything.
if you ask me, he's just trying to save himself.
I told him I wanted the bastards to pay for killing my friends.
he didn't give me a chance to say more.
he abandoned his unit.
there are no excep-- - I don't need you to quote regulations to me, sergeant.
tell us the location of the rebels.
I'll send my men to find out if you're telling the truth.
lock him in the stockade till they get back.
this d'haran's your new cellmate, Dror.
he's a coward, but he told us what we've been trying to beat out of you for weeks:
where to find your rebel friends.
you'd better pray he's lying, Dror, because if we find your friends then we won't need you anymore.
except to use your head to decorate a pole.
d'haran pig.
rebel scum.
trust me, I gave them the right information.
your friends are as good as dead.
and so are you.
we'll give richard three days.
if he's not back by then, we'll need a plan to get him out.
they store supply wagons outside the gate, here.
and if we set them on fire, maybe that would draw enough attention for one of us to slip in and find the seeker.
confessor.
is there anything I can do for you?
when I need you, I'll let you know.
Yes, confessor.
is there something else?
I feel guilty.
because you've been confessed.
no, no, confessor. I felt this way for a long time.
long before you used your power on me.
it's about the things I did, fighting for darken Rahl.
give us a moment.
I'm listening.
first,
I haven't sent any of my pay back to my wife in Azarith.
I gambled it away at dice.
you'll need to make up for that.
Yes, confessor, I will.
there's something else?
before I was conscripted into the army
I was a cook for a lord in our village.
it's all I ever wanted to do.
I never wanted to do anything else.
but Rahl needed every healthy man, so I was forced to join the army.
confessor, I did terrible things.
I went on raids, even against civilians.
I burned houses.
I hurt people.
Yeah, I kill
I ki-- I killed some.
well, that's what d'haran soldiers do.
no, I didn't have to.
I could have run.
the night before we raided Araban, my friend Kerwin deserted.
he asked me to go with him but I didn't.
I was too afraid.
well, you're not a soldier anymore.
maybe we can find a way for you to do some good now.
you lied. You sent us into an empty clearing.
you could have gotten us killed us to save your own skin.
you probably tramped in there like a pack of boars and the rebels heard you.
I can track better than anyone in this camp.
there wasn't a fire pit, wasn't even a snot rag.
there was never anyone there.
I would've found them.
you know what I think, sergeant?
you didn't wanna find the rebels.
you would've had to fight them.
Yeah, get him!
these men are cowards.
they can't track. They can't fight.
and if you don't want those rebels to kill you all, you need a man like me.
those men you just bloodied are my best soldiers.
all three of them are your superiors.
sir, it's not my fault they couldn't take advantage of the information I gave them.
every good woodsman knows a noisy hunter never catches his prey.
I don't trust anyone in this fort.
they're all schemers, liars, thugs.
you probably are too.
this is a very dangerous post.
the most dangerous in the midlands.
every day the rebels get more aggressive.
every time we step outside this fort our lives are at great risk.
so more than anything, what I need are men who can fight.
so maybe you are right.
maybe I could use a man like you.
sir, the men say you've got whisperers in this fort.
give me one and let me kill some rebels.
you got nerve, Dunn. But you need to slow down.
I'm going on a mission tomorrow.
I need a man to go with me.
prove yourself, then maybe I'll let you have your revenge.
no one goes past you.
Yes, sir.
whoa. Off limits.
comfortable with your new weapon?
well, it's not the sword of truth, is it?
but it'll do.
Dunn's getting closer to the captain than a fly on a cow's ass.
ask around. See if anyone knows anything about him.

I'd say he was 600 stone.
eight hundred.

he knows we're here.
how can you tell?
see how his hoof pivots a little as he caught our scent.
he ran off into the brush there.
if only we'd been downwind, might have had venison for supper.
sir, if I may, what's our objective on this mission?
you wanted to know our objective, Dunn.
there it is.
Grayson.
ready to do your duty, soldier?
is that family aiding the rebels?
and if they are?
I'm ready to do whatever's necessary, sir.
well, you're a hard man, Dunn. I like that.
but we're not going to kill them.
we're going to feed them.
sir? - They're my family.
look what your father's brought you!
the last chicken in the midlands!
it's too dangerous for a soldier to travel alone in these parts, Dunn.
too many rebels who'd like nothing better than the ears of a d'haran captain to adorn their trophy belts.
that's why I had to bring you along. - Yes, sir.
food's hard to come by in grayson these days.
it's the last loyalist village in the valley.

if you don't, I can always hand you back to sergeant Frye.
sorry, son.
your clumsy dad didn't mean to scare you like that.
I'm sorry.
Tanner jumps at every loud noise lately.
if I drop something, or a wagon passes.
the war's been hard on him.
he's afraid there'll be more fighting.
fighting? Here?
a few months ago rebels attacked our village.
he saw some people killed.
his best friend's house was burned to the ground.
do you have a wife, Carver?
her name's Maris.
she's in Azarith.
she must worry about you.
soldiers forget how hard war is on their families.
Yes, ma'am, maybe we do.
confessor, I found some blackberries, and I made these for you.
I usually use butter, but I could only find lard.
mm, it's delicious. - There's more.
that's plenty for me.
give them to the others.

Carver, that's the first time he's smiled in three months.
I'm so grateful my husband has a friend like you to watch out for him now.
sir?
there's something that's been weighing on my mind.
can I tell you the truth?
what is it?
your chicken was much too spicy.
I appreciate the honesty, Dunn.
and I appreciate what you did for my son.
what the rebels did to him, your village, my comrades,
I wanna make them pay.
sir, I think it's time you gave me a whisperer and let me go after them.
I can't do that.
but I've showed you I can fight, I can track.
I can be trusted.
I am beginning to trust you, Dunn.
I'm afraid we've run out of whisperers.
sir? - Relax, Dunn.
a shipment's on its way from d'hara, should arrive tomorrow.
isn't it too dangerous taking the weapons through rebel territory?
that's why they're being transported at night.
but even at night the open roads can be dangerous.
the rebels will never see them.
they're going through the rekuna pass.
I have orders to question the prisoner.
I didn't get any orders.
you're right. I don't have any orders.
but that rebel scum spit on me, insulted my friends.
I want a piece of him.
thought you might like to give me a hand.
got a visitor, Dror.
your old cellmate, come to pay his respects.
what are you doing? - I'm helping you escape.
Why? - Because I'm on your side.
I'm the seeker.
I'm sorry about how I treated you before.
I needed the d'harans to think I was one of them.
now, I want you to go back and find garrick.
you know my brother?
we're working together to stop the massacres.
you might need this.
how do I know this isn't a trick, so you can follow me back, kill my friends?
because I already know where they are.
a cave, about 600 paces southwest of the river crossing.
I need you to tell your brother a shipment of whisperers is coming through the rekuna pass tonight.
if he acts fast, he can capture them.
if you're the seeker, why not go after the weapons yourself?
because if I don't make bed check, the d'harans will think I deserted and send a search party.
but the next guard doesn't come on duty until dawn.
if you go now, you can reach garrick and intercept the shipment before anyone knows you're missing.
get his uniform on.
I'll try to slip away and meet up with you the first chance I get.
come on.
you're late, Dunn.
I'm gonna have to report you to the captain.
no need. I was just with him.
and he gave me this to share with my comrades.
pays to make friends with the right people.
plenty for everyone.
don't shoot! It's me, Dror.
Dror? I thought you were dead.
only taken prisoner.
the seeker helped me escape.
it's good to see you, brother.
we've got work to do.
who's the new man?
confessed d'haran.
the one the seeker is impersonating.
let's move out!
confessor.
I wanna go with you and fight the d'harans.
I wanna make up for the things I've done.
no. No more killing for you.
just stay here and make something to eat.
the men will be hungry when we get back.
Yes, confessor. I
rebel prisoner's escaped.
I need men for a search party.
I'll find him, sir.
captain, wait. - Not now, sergeant.
sorry, sir.
but you'll wanna hear this.
tell the captain what you told me.
I was posted at Azarith two summers ago.
I met archer Dunn there.
and that's not him.
I remember Dunn because another soldier at Azarith deserted.
a friend of his.
the officers suspected Dunn helped the man escape, but the other archers in dunn's unit convinced the officers that wasn't possible.
why not? - Well, Dunn was too timid.
he was too scared to even snicker when the other men were mocking the officers behind their backs.
they called him "mouse."
he was a laughingstock.
that was two summers ago.
maybe your memory's cloudy.
no, sir. I remember Dunn clear as day.
scrawny with yellow hair.
confessor? Did you get the weapons?
I'm glad.
torben the blacksmith was killed.
I'm sorry.
would you like something to eat?
get away from me!
I'm sorry for the loss of your friend.
you're sorry?
you're one of them, you d'haran bastard!
missing
confessor, thank you for giving me another chance.
he's dead.
this is ridiculous,
I never saw this soldier before, not in Azarith or anywhere else.
you're calling Voss a liar?
sir, you know Frye hates me.
I thrashed him in front of his men, humiliated him.
he ordered this soldier to make these accusations because he wants revenge.
a liar's excuse.
I am doing my duty:
protecting against an infiltrator and serving darken Rahl.
captain, this man is an imposter, maybe even a spy.
it's time for him to get four arrows in his chest.
you two are dismissed.
but, captain-- - don't push me, sergeant.
move.
you're confined to the garrison till I get to the truth of this.
it was cold-blooded murder.
dror must be punished.
you think I'm going to let you punish my own brother for killing a d'haran?
after what those pigs did to him in their stockade, after they killed so many of our people.
it wasn't Carver who tortured your brother or killed your friends.
he was a soldier in Rahl's army, wasn't he?
he was confessed.
he was a changed man.
and he wasn't even armed.
it's my duty as a confessor to bring his killer to justice.
I'm not going to let that happen.
we have the weapons.
there's no need for Richard to spend another minute in that garrison.
we need to get him out.
not yet.
we still have time before the d'harans realize they've been robbed.
pack up the whisperers.
we're going to pay a little visit to the good citizens of grayson village.
Why? - Grayson is filled with loyalists.
let's see how they like it when Rahl's dark magic is used against them.
those people are civilians.
you use the weapons against them and you're no better than rahl.
I won't let you do it.
stay out of our way, confessor.
I wanna believe you.
your instincts are sharp, sir.
don't try to flatter me, Dunn.
swear to me on your father's soul that you're telling the truth.
I swear.
I trusted you.
I brought you home to meet my family, even thought we could be friends, if that's possible in this cursed place.
so if you're lying to me,
I won't send you to the crossbows.
I'll kill you myself.
captain. Dunn's wife is here.
his wife?
Yes, sir, she's outside the gate, very agitated.
claims she walked for days from azarith to find her husband.
says he left her destitute.
insists on seeing him, sir.
sir, I know that's against regulations, send her away.
you see, sir?
anyone else in this garrison would murder his bunkmate just for the chance to smell his woman's skin.
when she sees this man isn't her husband, it'll prove he's a liar.
let's find out.
you abandoned me.
you haven't sent a penny home for your children.
how do you expect us to survive?
you shouldn't have come here.
don't they pay you?
how much does he earn?
well, ma'am, he's only beexz.
well, he hasn't sent me money for months.
you selfish wench.
who's watching our children while you're chasing after me?
captain, I'm sorry about this.
let me get rid of her.
may have made quick work of you, sergeant, but I don't think Carver Dunn is any match for his wife.
wench? - You started it. Did you have to hit me so hard?
Richard, we have to get out of here.
Garrick's captured the whisperers and he's going to use them to attack grayson.
the village? It's full of innocent women and children. Why?
revenge.
the captain's family lives there.
I have to warn him.
no. He'll know you're a spy.
go.
he's the seeker!
close the gates!
after them!
stop!
out of our way, seeker.
don't do this, Garrick.
think about what we're fighting for, an end to all the suffering.
to stop us, you're gonna have to kill us.
keep moving!
take them all!
get out of here before they kill you all!
stop! Or everyone dies!
we're close enough to the village that all of those people will be on their way to the underworld too.
but I can still stop the whisperer from releasing its magic.
so if you wanna save those people, then retreat.
now.
all of you!
what's to stop you from killing them anyway once we're gone?
that's a chance you'll just have to take.
run!
you betrayed me.
but you're fighting the rebels. Why?
they were going to attack grayson.
why does the seeker care about a loyalist village?
my mission is to stop Darken Rahl, not kill innocent people.
thank you for saving my family.
but my duty is to serve Lord Rahl.
I don't wanna fight you.
then die where you stand.
no, stay back.
I could have used a man who can fight like you.
do your duty, seeker.
finish me.
go back to your family.
maybe we should have kept at least one of the weapons.
we could have used it to attack Darken Rahl.
nobody should have weapons like these.
too many innocent people have already died.
the d'haran captain wasn't innocent.
he would've killed you in a heartbeat if he had the chance.
he might still try again someday.
why did you let him go?
why did you try to protect Carver Dunn?
the prophecy says that the seeker will defeat darken Rahl.
thanks to the seeker, that monster is dead
and rotting for all eternity in the underworld.
kneel before the keeper.
forgive me, master. I have failed you.
no, you have succeeded
exactly as I intended.
it's a tear in the veil that separates the underworld from the living.
this happened when I killed Rahl.
as long as it's open there's no way to prevent the keeper of the underworld from sending his minions to bring death to every living thing.
the only way to close the rift is the way the creator sealed the underworld.
the stone of tears. We'll find it.
seek out the abbot of Ulrich,
for he keeps the secret of the stone close to his heart.
she's the one who helped me kill darken Rahl.
she did it to save her own skin.
if you're foolish enough to turn down the throne of d'hara, then you need me all the more.
if this is some sort of trick,
I will kill you.
mark of the keeper.
the one who would destroy all life.
richard Cypher, you are the true seeker.
thanks for letting me borrow this.
although I can't say it helped me sleep more soundly.
it's gonna take a while to get used to having a mord-sith in camp.
well, if Richard trusts Cara,
I suppose we'll have to learn to as well.
does it hurt?
it's nothing.
the spirit of the tyrant you killed
comes back from the grave
and burns the mark of the keeper in your chest?
it's not nothing, Richard.
I wish I knew what it meant.
what we do know is that we need to seal the rift between this world and the underworld.
and to do that, we need to find the stone of tears,
and to find the stone, we need to get to the abbot of Ulrich.
it must have burned at least three months ago.
these weeds are at least that old.
d'harans did this.
then where are the corpses?
if the abbot isn't here,
then we've come a long way for nothing.
if d'harans did this,
and they didn't kill the monks,
where would they have taken them?
from here, they would have been taken to Tothrayne.
what's Tothrayne?
a death camp.
no, please, no!
I have a son!
the war is over!
I don't want to die!
move! The faster you get this loaded, the faster you'll get your reward.
general, why are we still executing prisoners?
the war is over.
we should be getting far away from this place.
you've heard the reports of reprisals against d'harans.
the best way to ensure there are no reprisals for what's been done here
is to make certain that no one lives to tell the tale.
don't worry, commander.
we'll take this treasure and we'll be far away from here by the time anyone comes looking for retribution.
just as soon as we've finished the task at hand.
stay there!
and now here's your reward.
all right, I'll do you a favor.
I'll leave it loose.
you'll take longer to die.
the seeker. Kill him!
thanks for the favor.
bless you, seeker.
we're looking for the abbot of ulrich.
we believe he was brought here.
I'm sorry, I don't know anything about the abbot.
there are children here we have to free.
the d'harans didn't just come for resistance fighters.
they took our families too.
where are they?
come. I'll show you.
it's all right.
you're safe.
I need to find my son.
what's his name?
William. I'm Eleanor.
don't worry. I'll help you find him.
mother!
Oh!
I thought I'd lost you.
Oh, thank the spirits you're safe!
the abbot of ulrich.
he was brought here.
where is he?
the general had him executed yesterday.
I tried to stop the executions.
you didn't try hard enough.
we all lived in fear of the general.
there's a reason that we called him the butcher.
if we hadn't followed his orders
it would've been our necks in nooses.
it may still be.
but that's for the mother confessor to decide.
lock them in the cells.
we came here for the abbot.
he's dead.
there's no reason for us to stay.
look at these people.
they're sick, they're scared.
they have no place to go.
we can't just leave them here.
there's already enough sickness in this place.
let's bury these bodies before it gets any worse.
lord Rahl?
you served me well in life, general.
it is my hope that you will do the same for the keeper,
now that you are dead.
I don't understand.
it's quite simple.
the keeper of the underworld wants to make you an offer.
those of you that are well enough to travel are free to leave,
but those of you that aren't,we'll be making a camp just outside the prison.
if these prisoners are going to gain their strength back,
we're gonna have to feed them something more substantial than d'haran gruel.
should we draw them warm baths?
do you know of anyone heading in the direction of deerfork?
the dragon corps wiped out deerfork months ago.
but that's my father's village.
we'll try to find out where the survivors have relocated.
deerfork was a resistance stronghold.
no one would've been left alive.
my father wasn't a resistance fighter.
he was just a locksmith.
that would've made no difference to the dragon corps.
where will we go?
the rest of my family died here.
I am so sorry for your loss.
but you need to be strong for your son.
we'll see what we can find out about your father.
you shouldn't give her false hope.
it wasn't so long ago that you served the one who caused all this misery.
at least try to show some compassion.
come with me.
I checked the store rooms.
there's barely enough to feed the rats.
how can there be this many people with no food?
when the war ended, supply shipments stopped.
what food there was went to the guards.
the d'harans would sooner put a knife in our bellies than a hot meal.
I'm sending Cara out To get provisions.
hopefully there'll be enough for everyone.
move.
everyone?
we'd have more if we didn't have so many mouths to feed.
the d'harans will be brought to justice,
but we're not gonna starve them to get it.
Yes, mother confessor.
I need a horse.
we need the horses to get provisions.
you can bury him outside with the others.
I'm not burying my brother alongside the d'harans who killed him.
he should be laid to rest beside our mother and father.
we're going to need fresh water.
my village is half a day's ride.
I'll have the horse back to you by morning.
check on the sister.
do it quickly.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
seeker?
I heard you were looking for abbot henry.
I was a member of his order.
we need to confide in you a great secret.
there's been a tear in the veil between this world and the underworld.
the keeper is waging war on the land of the living.
he's using the rift to send horrible creatures into our world.
and the only way to close this rift
is for us to find the stone of tears.
we were told that abbot henry had knowledge of the secret location of the stone.
the abbots of our order always wore a locket.
it has a rose inscribed on its face
and it was passed down from abbot to abbot.
Shota said the abbot would keep the secret close to his heart.
the d'harans took the locket
when they brought us to this awful place.
we lived in peace until the d'harans came.
seize the abbot.
what is this?
what is the meaning of this?
you have no authority here.
there's no need for this.
we're men of peace.
No! No! Please!
please! That's sacred!
anything taken from the abbot would've been kept with the valuables we took from the other prisoners.
it was the butcher's plan to escape with the treasure.
to disappear,
and use it to make new lives for himself and his men.
now the treasure can help us give the prisoners' lives back.
open it.
I've seen him before.
a man came to the stables
asking for a horse so he could take his brother to be buried.
apparently he took the treasure instead.
and you believed his story?
the confessor told me I had to show more compassion.
are you saying this is my fault?
Yes.
it doesn't matter whose fault it is.
we need to find him.
I came to give them some food.
did you see who did this?
it was the butcher.
he's come back from the grave.
quickly, everyone get inside.
this way.
is it true what they're saying?
that the butcher killed those people?
I don't know.
but you'll be safe inside the prison.
we need to set up a guard through the night,
make sure no one gets in or out.
I can take first watch.
keep the doors locked. Keep everyone inside.
that won't stop him.
I got to see what the butcher was capable of when he killed my friends.
if he has come back to take his revenge,
he won't stop until he's killed us all.
whoever it is, we'll keep them out.
but just in case.
I've looked everywhere.
there's no sign of whoever murdered these men.
is it possible the rumors are true?
the butcher's come back from the grave?
like darken Rahl did.
darken Rahl was just a spirit.
spirits don't have bodies.
they can't pick up knives and slaughter people.
well, we're going to find who did.
in the meantime,
I need you to find the man who stole the abbot's locket.
he can't have gotten far.
I don't want him tortured or killed.
bring him back alive.
I'll do my best.
if this butcher's escaped from the grave,
I'd like to see it for myself.
someone dug him up.
no.
he clawed his way out.
so did the rest of the d'harans we buried.
could this be the work of the keeper?
darken Rahl?
it's possible.
who else could bring the dead back to life?
the mord-sith.
Cara's with us now.
why would she come all this way to resurrect some d'harans with the breath of life?
she served Rahl and fought side-by-side with the d'harans for years.
Cara helped me defeat Rahl.
whoever did this, however it happened,
we have a big problem.
how do you kill something that's already dead?
we have to find them first.
I'm not here to harm you. Who are you?
I am abbot henry.
the d'harans told us that you had been hung.
after the d'harans executed me,
I awoke in the underworld.
in a pit of unimaginable suffering,
I was greeted by darken Rahl himself.
he told me that the keeper wished to make me an offer.
he would allow me to return to the land of the living,
but he demanded an awful price.
in exchange for letting me live again,
I had to agree to kill for the keeper.
he made you a baneling.
banelings are dead souls
who selfishly bargain for a second life in exchange for killing others.
I thought they were just a legend.
so did I,
but it seems the keeper is using the tear in the veil
to give the dead a chance
to return to the world of the living.
I guess the butcher and his men accepted his offer.
so can anyone who die become a baneling?
maybe not.
maybe only in places like Tothrayne.
the veil between our world and the underworld
is weakest in places of great death.
the rift is growing.
if we don't close it soon,
the keeper could send banelings back anywhere.
we need to find the stone of tears
to close the rift in the veil.
brother Bertrand told us that the secret of the stone
was inside your locket.
Yes.
that's why I had to take the keeper's offer.
to reclaim the locket and ensure the stone's location wasn't lost forever.
well, we're trying to find the locket right now.
what's wrong?
I haven't fulfilled my end of the keeper's bargain.
I haven't killed anyone yet.
I'm being called back to the underworld.
tell us what we need to do with the locket.
I spent years learning the rituals I would need to pass on to you.
there's simply not enough time.
well, we have to buy you time.
how?
you have to kill someone.
I'm not sure I can do this.
you'll be killing a d'haran guilty of horrible crimes.
it may be the only way to defeat the keeper.
they're already dead.
we have to find someone else for him to kill.
there's no time.
you must listen to me.
the locket contains a rune scriber.
the magic imprints a rune
onto the palm of the one who opens it.
you must take the rune to the province of Pamorah.
the rune is the key
that will open the
what about me?
don't I get any?
Oh, there's plenty to go around.
sorry to interrupt.
I know you're mourning the loss of your brother.
we all grieve in our own way.
Where's the treasure?
I'm not afraid of you.
do you know what horrible things they did to me at Tothrayne?
intimately.
I didn't break when they put me on the rack
or when they threw me in the drowning pool,
or when they spun me on the wheel of pain.
torture me all you want.
you'll be wasting your time.
Oh, I don't want to torture you.
I have other ways of loosening your tongue.
after the awful way they treated you in that place,
I can see why you would hire those women
to bring you some comfort.
but I'll do things to you those women can't even imagine.
many know of a mord-sith's ability to bring pain,
but few know we are equally skilled at bringing pleasure.
first, I'm going to...
and then I'll...
but first you need to tell me where
in a cave three leagues outside town.
at the fork in the river.
get dressed.
but I told you where the treasure was.
take me to it.
now.
what about that thing you were going to do?
and that other thing sounded good too.
all right, all right. Just the first thing, then.
the rune is the key, but a key to what?
we have no idea what to do with it once we get there.
we have a bigger problem:
the butcher and his men are out somewhere. And they need to kill.
but who killed these men?
the butcher wouldn't bother with a locked cell
when there's much easier prey within these walls.
who else would want them dead?
I'm sure any prisoner would want revenge against the d'harans.
but only one of them had keys to the cells.
who?
a prisoner.
a resistance fighter.
find him.
what's stopping these dead d'harans from taking the keeper's deal
and becoming banelings themselves?
you said banelings are creatures of the flesh.
when their souls return to this world, they need a body.
what are you thinking?
we burn them, Zedd.
this is what you're looking for.
did you open this?
answer me.
Yes.
some strange ink came out and did this.
what?
you've been marked by powerful magic, boy.
we have to take him with us to Pamorah.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
take him to Kahlan. Have her confess him.
no. We don't know how the confessor's touch will affect the rune's magic.
seems this is worth quite a bit to you.
at least as much as the treasure.
you want me to go with you to this Pamorah?
it'll cost you.
you're not getting the treasure.
well, then, I guess I'm not going anywhere.
and this hand goes where I go.
not if I cut it off.
when do we leave?
lock him in the warden's office.
until we deal with the banelings.
you know, this would be a good place
for you to keep up your end of our bargain.
Hey. Hey!
Hey! Hey!
our thief won't be going anywhere without us.
you brought him back without a scratch.
how'd you manage that?
I have other methods.
what kind of methods?
well, however you did it,
it's good work.
did you expect anything less?
I'm just glad to have you on our side.
maybe you can tell Zedd and Kahlan
that they can stop sleeping with weapons under their pillows.
the d'haran guards were killed on your watch.
I gave you keys to the cells and a weapon.
you wanted revenge for the death of your friends?
I won't lie to you, mother confessor.
after what they did to my friends,
I'm not sorry they're dead.
I'm just sorry I wasn't the one who did it.
I believe you.
which means there's still a killer out there.
look, you can let me out.
I'm not going to try to escape.
I'll go with you to this Pamorah.
he's dead.
he was the key to the stone of tears.
please, don't hurt me.
there's nothing to fear here.
where am I?
in the underworld.
I-- I'm dead?
Yes.
but you don't have to remain that way.
all the keeper asks is that in exchange for life,
you kill for him.
no, please!
you bear the rune.
No!
are you all right? Can you talk?
I-- I thought I was dead.
I brought you back.
you're welcome.
I saw darken Rahl.
darken Rahl?
who stabbed you?
at first I couldn't figure out
how you got into a locked cell to kill the d'harans.
but then I remembered.
you're the daughter of a locksmith.
you must have died before we arrived.
I only accepted the keeper's offer
so that I could watch over William.
this war has already made so many orphans.
I couldn't bear the thought of my son
being so alone and helpless.
I had to keep killing to satisfy the keeper.
but after what the d'harans did to us,
they deserved it.
and when you ran out of d'harans?
wouldn't you kill to protect the ones you love?
you know we can't let you kill any more people.
promise me,
that you'll make sure my William is safe.
we need to get to the armory and grab every weapon we can find.
and how will we find the butcher and his men?
well, they need to kill.
they'll go where they can find the easiest prey.
that's the last of them.
we'll need more.
then we'll head north.
I have a more important task for you, general.
my lord.
you must capture the one who bears the rune of Pamorah.
tell me where I can find him.
he's in Tothrayne.
but my lord, the seeker is there.
then you don't have much time.
the runebearer is the key to finding the stone of tears.
if the seeker should acquire the stone,
then the rift between the two worlds will be closed,
and all of you returned to the underworld.
I will not fail you.
Kahlan is keeping everyone safe.
you, Cara and I are going to track the banelings.
and when we find them?
we trap them and burn them.
we're not gonna need the horses.
give us the one who bears the rune.
again! Put your backs into it, men!
when Flynn was in the underworld,
Rahl must've seen the rune.
he must know it's the key to the stone of tears.
these walls are strong. If the banelings can't get to us, they can't kill And they'll die again.
he'll just send his men to find more victims.
they'll grown stronger out there while we grow weaker in here.
they're not gonna stop until they get in.
well, if they want in, we'll let them come.
and what about Kahlan and all the others?
we'll get them out the back way.
this is a prison. There is no back way.
we can make one.
quickly! Let's go, come on.
hang on.
hurry.
come on.
they've all gone.
not all of us.
welcome back to Tothrayne.
after all the suffering these people have been through,
now they'll have a chance to rebuild their lives.
Zedd's already helping them with that.
that's for you.
thank you.
for your family.
thank you.
you know,
it's a long road to Pamorah.
it could get a little lonely.
you're right.
it is a long road to Pamorah.
Aah!
and if you want to make it there in one piece,
you won't try my patience.
the seeker said you needed me alive.
Yes.
but he didn't say you had to be comfortable.
William, this is Bertrand.
he's gonna take you to a place called timberfalls.
there's a family there that can't wait to meet you.
I think you'll like it there.
lots of children to play with.
does that sound all right?
thank you. Goodbye.
now I know what Rahl meant
when he said I was marked for the keeper.
with every person I kill,
I'm giving the keeper another soldier to add to his army.
killing my enemies only makes him stronger.
it's not just your enemies.
it's people like Eleanor.
good people desperate enough to accept the keeper's offer.
he's using their desire for life to create more death.
then can we risk killing our enemies?
we don't have a choice.
if we have to kill to save an innocent life, we'll do it.
no matter how many souls the keeper claims,
as long as there are even a few people left to create life,
and as long as people are willing to protect that life,
the keeper can't win.
it's just over this next hill.
you know, the other children will be so excited to see you.
Hey, uh...
you all right, William?
are you hurt?
you're a baneling.
you are the true Seeker.
people have tried for years to find the forest of the Night Wisps.
had you come here on your own, they'd have never shown themselves.
they only come out for those they trust.
I've come to ask you for your help.
a Dreamcaster sent me a message that soon,
I'd be the last Confessor.
I need to know if there are any Confessors still alive.
may the Spirits protect you.
you're beautiful.
are you trying to tell me something?
who were you talking to?
myself.
who else do I have to talk to?
it is late. Get some sleep.
father, I'm almost a grown woman.
I can't stay here forever.
I wanna travel to distant lands, and fall in love, and get married.
that will never happen, Annabelle.
you're safe here.
that is all that matters.
what is it?
the Night Wisps searched everywhere in the Midlands and beyond for another Confessor.
but they only found one.
only one.
who is this other Confessor?
it's strange.
the Night Wisps didn't know who she was.
at least she's still alive.
but for how long?
she's in a tower in Raawlenwood Castle in Ossridge.
it sounds like she's a prisoner.
we can be there and back in three days.
Ossridge? I've traveled across the Midlands with you people for weeks now because you said you had to get me and this thing on my hand to Pamorah to find your precious Stone of Tears.
but instead we're going to Ossridge?
perhaps before we see about this Confessor, we should get the stone
I'll go and meet with you in Pamorah.
you're not going alone.
Zedd, you and Cara can go to Pamorah.
Flynn, you can come with us.
what?
Why?
I've been thinking. We know this rune is a key.
but we don't know what it opens, or who or what might try to stop us from getting it.
you and Cara should find out before we put the rune or Flynn in harm's way.
we'll meet back here in three days.
thank you, Tharla.
father. Help him.
it's just a sleeping potion.
I had to set you free, Annabelle. - But
he'll keep you locked up forever.
we must hurry. Before his men catch us.
you're too late.
the servant Tharla poisoned his Lordship.
he's dead. She took Annabelle.
took her where? - I don't know.
they rode away, taking the fastest horses.
Annabelle? She's a Confessor?
how did you know?
was she a prisoner here?
she was Lord Callum's daughter.
years ago, Lord Callum was a powerful D'Haran commander.
he attacked a neighboring village.
but the villagers had the Confessor Josephine on their side.
she confessed Lord Callum in battle.
he was betrothed to a beautiful duchess, a woman he'd loved since childhood.
but once Callum was confessed, he thought of no one but Josephine.
she took him as her mate.
soon she was with child.
but the birth was not an easy one.
and when she died, he was released.
he suddenly realized everything he had lost when he became confessed.
feed her to the crows.
I feared he might kill the child too, he was in such rage.
but Lord Callum could not bring himself to slay his own flesh and blood.
he swore that no one would ever suffer at his daughter's hands as he did at her mother's.
he hid her away for her whole life in the tallest tower of the castle.
he never told her of her powers.
her curse, as he called it.
we have to find her.
they can't have gotten far.
where are we going?
someplace safe.
why are we here?
I see you've brought the girl.
a hundred gold pieces was our agreement.
what agreement?
what are you doing?
I need proof that she is what you say she is.
she doesn't know what she is.
she's never used her powers.
what powers?
a demonstration won't be necessary.
I don't have any powers.
what are you doing to me?
all right, that's enough.
no more until you pay.
or he kills the girl.
no, no.
I have enough to see if it's genuine.
master, how can I serve you?
kill...
her.
no.
you're going to be very useful to me.
let her go!
the Seeker. - And the Mother Confessor.
kill him and take her.
hide her.
run!
run, Annabelle!
get her!
are you all right?
where did you come from?
Oh, I just wait around in trees hoping to rescue pretty girls.
think you can stand?
are you a prince?
is it that obvious?
are you all right?
let them go.
we have to get Annabelle.
Annabelle, no!
command me, Confessor.
what's wrong with him?
he's been confessed. Not your fault.
you don't have control over your powers yet.
what powers? - You're a Confessor. Just like I am.
confessor?
when you touch someone with your powers, they become enslaved to you.
they lose their free will.
I did that? I enslaved him?
I'm glad you did.
I want to serve you.
how do I take it away? - You can't.
he'll be confessed to you for the rest of your life.
I didn't know.
your father didn't tell you because he was afraid of your powers.
that's why he kept you locked in a tower.
you talked to my father?
I'm so sorry, Annabelle.
your father is dead.
dead?
he was poisoned.
Tharla killed him.
so she could sell me to that sorcerer.
he wanted to take your magic.
but don't worry.
he won't come near you again.
we're gonna take you to a place where you can be trained. - Trained?
so they can teach you how to control your magic, so nothing like this will ever happen again.
stop. You're scaring her.
she just found out her father died.
she needs to know everything's all right.
I won't let anything bad happen to you. Ever.
Annabelle, you have a very rare and special gift.
if I can teach you about it, if you'll come with us...
it's all right.
they're good people.
I'll go wherever he goes.
come on.
excuse me, sir.
pardon me, madam.
you and your Agiels don't exactly inspire a warm welcome.
I've learned it's more useful to be feared than liked.
excuse me, sir. - What do you want?
could you tell us where we could find the Cloister of Pamorah?
in the Sentinel Hills, east of the city.
but I wouldn't go now.
you don't wanna be on the road after nightfall.
thank you for seeing me, Miss Prioress.
have you seen this symbol before?
the parchment will do you no good.
the tomb must be opened by the one who bears the rune on his hand.
what tomb?
in times past, the tomb was the site of many a pilgrimage.
legend has it the Stone of Tears was buried there.
darken Rahl sent his men to Pamorah to open the tomb.
they tried everything, but no one could get inside it.
without the rune.
Rahl believed the bearer of the rune would arrive one day, so he stioned an elite guard around the tomb.
after Rahl fell, the villagers rose up, and killed them.
every last D'Haran.
but they came back from the dead.
banelings.
that's what everyone around here is so afraid of.
they accepted the Keeper's twisted bargain.
killing to stay alive.
they're still waiting for the bearer of the rune to arrive.
to make sure no one gets the stone.
where is this tomb?
in a cemetery, to the south.
but going anywhere near it means certain death.
I wonder where Flynn's family is?
I never asked him.
it's not your fault this happened.
we took him with us because we needed him.
now he'll spend the rest of his life desperately longing for someone he'll never see again.
we, maybe after Pamorah
no. No.
Flynn will be a distraction.
my whole life, I wanted to see the world.
and now that I'm out here, I don't understand any of it.
I'll teach you.
Kahlan says I have to go to a place called Aydindril to be trained.
I'll come with you. - She says you can't.
that you have something more important to do in Pamorah with Richard.
I don't want to go anywhere without you.
then you'll get your wish.
how? It's late.
we all need some sleep.
my mistress is cold.
I'm gonna get some more wood for the fire.
maybe Flynn and I can get married.
I'm sorry, Annabelle.
that isn't going to happen.
but he loves me.
and I love him.
and in the books I've read
it isn't the same with Confessors.
we serve a higher purpose.
Buour gift makes the kind of romance you've read about...
...impossible.
so you can't get married?
a Confessor takes a mate, but not for love.
to continue our line.
and there aren't very many of us left.
I think you and I may be the only ones.
so one day, when you're ready, you'll take a suitable mate.
what makes a mate suitable?
ll, uh, he should be strong, noble and brave.
a leader.
so Richard's your mate, then?
no.
I love Richard, but if he and I were to be together in that way, he would become confessed.
but he already loves you.
richard has an important mission only he can carry out.
if he were confessed, his love for me would be all-consuming.
it would distract him so much he would go mad.
and he couldn't complete his quest.
so you can never be with someone you love?
once you start your training and see how important our work is, you'll understand that it makes up for the things we can't have.
the sorcerer's men! They're coming!
keep her safe!
come on.
what are you doing?
granting your wish.
there's no one here.
they're gone.
and so are the horses.
you're bleeding.
I had to make it look real.
I fooled them so that we could get away.
isn't that what you wanted?
does it hurt?
for you, nothing hurts.
when I was in the tower, the servants used to secretly bring me books to read.
have you ever heard the story of Rosalind and Palomar?
Yeah, everybody knows that story.
she saved him from the dragon.
and then they sail away on the ocean together.
you remind me of Palomar.
at least the way I imagined him.
I'd save you from a dragon.
would you take me to see the ocean?
I'd take you anywhere.
what?
this rune is the key to finding the Stone of Tears.
unless Richard has it, the Keeper will destroy all life.
including yours.
how do you know what they told you is true?
my father told me there was nothing but war and wickedness in this world.
that was a lie.
yore proof of that.
and even if what they're saying is true,
I'd rather die with you than be locked in another tower without you.
I should've separated them right away.
he was comforting a scared girl. It would have been cruel.
she would have been safe.
we'll find them.
look. The tracks split.
one horse went north. The other east.
he was trying to make it harder for us to follow him. Clever.
not clever enough.
these tracks are deeper.
the horse that went that way wasn't carrying any weight.
hungry? Wait here.
you know what we do with thieves around here?
show them mercy?
well. Two thieves.
maybe you've got something to bargain with.
stay away from her.
command me, Confessor.
Hey!
stop them.
the only way to kill banelings is to burn them.
we'll need oil and torches.
why not just use Wizard's Fire?
I don't think that would be wise.
it's because I'm a Mord-Sith, isn't it?
you think if you use your magic,
I'll turn it against you.
I've had chances before.
with the Seeker and Confessor nearby.
and now you know where the tomb is.
do you honestly think that's why I've followed Richard all this way?
in the hopes that he'd send me here with you alone so that I could find a way to steal the stone for myself?
probably not.
but what's at stake is far too important to rely on probability.
I don't believe you have the luxury of caution.
get them!
I think that's all of them.
for now.
but this is a place of death.
others may crawl out of the earth to replace them.
we should get Flynn back here with the rune as quickly as we can.
we? Are u sure you can trust me?
no. But I don't have the luxury of caution.
I know this is hard for you, but we have to get moving.
we've lost enough time as it is.
if you don't leave, my friends will make you leave.
Richard, they're all confessed.
let's go.
what's wrong?
I know Richard and Kahlan.
sooner or later, they'll catch us.
No!
mistress...
...how can I serve you?
are you hurt?
I'm fine. Let's go.
I'll come with you, Mistress.
everything he does is to save lives.
he saved yours.
and you've destroyed him.
I'm sorry, Kahlan.
but you didn't leave me a choice.
and you leave me no choice.
I won't let you kill her.
kill me?
it's the only way to release me from Confession.
but don't worry. I'll protect you.
Richard, I don want to fight you.
then put down your weapon.
I'll get the horse.
what are you doing? Don't hurt him.
let him go.
you will order both of these men to come with me to Pamorah right now, or I will kill him.
you wouldn't hurt him.
you need the rune on his hand.
I need him in Pamorah. If he doesn't go, he's of no use to me.
if we go with you and Flynn gets you your stone, will you let us be together?
you have my word.
it's a trap.
she'll try to kill you the first chance she gets.
Richard, I know you're confessed to her, but you know me.
I'm not a liar.
no, she isn't.
put your sword down.
we're going with her.
she said she'd order Flynn to go to Pamorah with us if I let them live.
and you agreed to that?
I had to.
either Richard was going to kill me, or I was gonna kill him.
I needed Zedd.
No!
Flynn! You promised!
you lied to me! - I had to!
if the Keeper wins, everyone will die!
I need the Seeker to fight him and seal the rift in the Underworld.
I need you to be you, Richard!
Annabelle! No! Don't kill her. I love her!
I love her as much as I ever loved you.
I know you, Kahlan.
you don't want to murder the last Confessor.
I never asked to be a Confessor.
I never asked to be locked in a tower.
I just want to be like everyone else.
if there was any other way
maybe there is.
the sorcerer's quillion.
if we can get it we can use it to drain Annabelle's powers.
would Richard and Flynn be released?
I doubt it's ever been tried.
but in theory, they shouldn't be bound by magic she herself no longer possesses.
Kahlan, if you love me you'll give it a try.
he's only saying that because he's been confessed.
confessed or not, Richard would do anything to save a life.
we have to get the stone first.
and then we'll go to the sorcerer's cave and get his quillion.
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
you want us to risk everything
our lives, Richard's life.
to save her?
if you don't have the stomach to kill her, I will.
I seem to remember Richard going to great lengths to save your life.
and if it doesn't release him?
then I'll do what needs to be done.
it's another locket.
maybe there's another rune inside it.
or maybe it holds the Stone of Tears.
the Seeker should be the one to open it.
when he's released from confession.
not when he's this unpredictable.
you got what you came for.
we need to go after the quillion.
he can still fight.
he'd do anything to save her life.
we both know Richard can't be relied upon right now.
then Cara and I will just have to take care of the sorcerer ourselves.
are you sure?
any sorcerer as powerful as Lorcus is going to be able to see right through us if we aren't convincing.
if you insist.
this will hurt. - Just do it.
I have something the sorcerer would be very interested in.
surrender your weapon.
go ahead. Take it.
I know the power of the Agiel.
lay it down yourself.
and the other one.
now summon your sorcerer, or I take my merchandise elsewhere.
and what would a Mord-Sith expect in return for her "merchandise?
a thousand gold pieces.
why would I pay such a price?
rumor has it you're in the market for Confessor power.
this is the Mother Confessor.
I sincerely doubt you'd be made a better offer.
she's no use to me dead.
she's not dead. Just compliant.
how do I know that?
examine her yourself.
command me, Confessor.
call off your guards.
stop!
don't harm them.
give me the quillion.
you spared my life even when your friends told you not to.
you can thank me if this works.
if it does, you'll be the last Confessor.
you'll have to take a mate.
Yes. Someday I will.
richard would make a good father for a Confessor, wouldn't he?
Annabelle-- - If he's confessed to me, you can't hurt him.
and he could give you a child.
and then when you take my magic he'll be released, won't he?
Yes, but, that isn't the way that
maybe you should consider what she is suggesng.
if something were to happen to you, then the race of Confessors would be no longer.
I want to do something for you while I'm still a Confessor.
please.
but I don't love her. I love you.
this will make me very happy.
go to her.
and love her as you would love me.
it's all right.
it's all right.
what are you thinking about?
pleasing you.
because your mistress ordered you to?
Yes.
you really love her, don't you?
with all my heart.
did I do something wrong?
no.
you didn't do anything wrong.
but my mistress commanded me to
I know.
I guess I wouldn't want to give myself to Flynn like that if he was thinking about somebody else.
it isn't just that.
richard would never use magic to force someone to act against their will.
but it's not really against his will.
if he wasn't confessed, he would want to.
but he is confessed.
and I'm not prepared to make that decision for him.
or to make him a father without his blessing.
but for Confessors...
isn't it always like that?
that's why we don't take men we love as mates.
it's kind of like being locked in a tower, isn't it?
we should get started.
if this works, I can get married one day.
I hope you will.
but Flynn won't love me anymore.
he's just the first one you met. There will be other men.
but what if he's the only one that I'll ever love?
Annabelle, are you all right?
it didn't work.
I'm not confessed anymore.
I was just making sure she was all right.
we'll see you safely home.
your father's castle is rightfully yours now.
thank you, but, uh,
I think I've spent enough of my life there.
I want to see the world.
where we're going won't be safe.
I'll go myself.
I've always wanted to see the ocean.
I don't think it's safe for you to travel alone.
I'll take her.
I mean, um, I'm headed toward Wynnmore anyway.
I-- I have a cousin there.
it's near the ocean.
what? You don't need me anymore.
so you can come along, if you want to.
well, I can't say it's been fun, but it's been interesting.
it's only me now.
no. You got us.
Kahlan, I can understand why you couldn't go through with it.
but part of me wishes you had.
me too.
and now that we have our Seeker back...
it's time to open this.
is it the Stone of Tears?
no. I think it's a compass.
this orb will guide the Seeker's way.
to what?
hopefully the Stone of Tears.
let's not waste time, then.
we head north.
richard Cypher, you are the true Seeker.
if the compass continues pointing us south, we'll go right past the Falls of Aldermont.
is that someplace important?
it's considered the most romantic spot in all the Midlands.
many a child was conceived beneath those cascading waters.
I was there once. It's beautiful.
Oh, really? And who were you with?
my sister.
at sunset, when the light hits the falls, the water glistens red.
they say it's the reflection of all the lovers' hearts who've kissed there.
that or a reflection of the blood spilled at the Battle of Aldermont.
two hundred men were killed in that spot.
the rest threw their bodies into the rapids rather than surrender.
well, that does sound romantic.
if we move fast, we can get there in time to see the sunset.
these men were tortured.
not very inspired work.
looks like they died before they hung.
then why hang them?
whoever did this wanted to put them on display to send a message.
whoever attempts to subvert justice shall meet the same fate.
Kahlan, take a look at this.
it's the seal of Aydindril.
I have to get to Aydindril.
that's hundreds of leagues from here.
Zedd, can you use that amulet to get us there?
its magic is only strong enough to transport a Wizard and a Confessor.
then we'll meet up with you there.
that could take weeks.
every day the quest is delayed, the Keeper grows stronger.
you and Cara continue the search for the Stone of Tears while Kahlan and I go to Aydindril.
the Seeker needs his Wizard and his Confessor by his side.
if we leave him again
after we killed Darken Rahl, you should have gone back to Aydindril then, but instead, you came with me.
the quest was more important.
the quest is my burden.
I've kept you away from your home long enough.
my home is with you.
we've been apart before.
we always find our way back to each other.
I wish I didn't have to go.
what--? What happened?
why am I still here?
and where's Zedd?
how do you feel?
all in one piece.
I wish I could say the same for the amulet.
at least it got us here safely.
it's good to be home.
if Zedd got to Aydindril and realized
I wasn't with him, he'd come back for me.
maybe he can't.
I have a feeling Zedd got to Aydindril with the other half of this.
even if he did get there, look at what happened to Silas.
Zedd could be walking into a trap.
the Wizard isn't exactly defenseless.
if I can get a horse I can be there in less than a week.
you can't go alone. It's too dangerous.
Cara and I will go with you.
but the compass is pointing in the opposite direction.
and we'll follow it that way once we know Zedd is safe.
let's go.
Silas knew that stealing the amulet could cost him his life.
it's a rare man willing to make such a sacrifice.
who are those guards?
prince Fyren's men.
prince Fyren? Of Kelton?
when Rahl fell, Fyren threw the D'Harans out of Kelton and Aydindril.
then he jailed the Council members and proclaimed himself "High Lord Regent.
in a forest near Gallimar, we found two bodies hanging from a tree bearing the seal of Aydindril round their necks.
Fyren's work.
he's given bands of hoodlums the authority to enforce his laws, mostly archaic or invented, demanding fines.
when people can't pay, or won't, he makes examples out of them.
I've heard enough. Where can I find Prince Fyren?
well.
what crime could this lovely young lady possibly have committed?
it's a private matter.
come closer.
tell me what I can do for you.
you can get out of my chair.
command me, Confessor.
order your men to stand down.
death to anyone who harms her!
the Mother Confessor has returned to Aydindril.
everyone answers to me or you will meet the same fate as Prince Fyren.
all of his edicts will be subject to my review.
there will be no more unjust fines or executions.
the rule of law will be restored to the Midlands.
what are you smiling about?
nothing. I was just thinking.
about what?
even though I'm worried about Zedd, I have to admit, part of me is glad the amulet didn't work.
I always dreamed we'd go to Aydindril together.
please, we won't do it again.
you've violated the code of Aydindril.
if you don't pay your fine, you'll be put to death. - For kissing her?
let them go.
this is none of your concern, Seeker.
we're here under the authority of the High Lord Regent of Aydindril.
release them. Now.
or what?
get out of here!
you're no Confessor.
what happened? Why didn't you confess him?
I couldn't. - What?
my power...
it's gone.
I knew I wasn't feeling right.
now I know why.
it must have been the accident with the amulet.
Richard, this has never happened before.
to any Confessor. Ever.
there has to be a way to fix it.
confessor magic isn't something you can just "fix.
without it I'm
I'm not a Confessor at all.
we'll get to Aydindril, we'll find Zedd
we don't even know if Zedd's alive.
it takes more magic than a broken amulet to kill Zedd. Trust me.
I asked our friends if we could borrow their horses.
they didn't object.
the faster we move, the sooner we can get back to Zedd.
come on.
the sentence issued by Prince Fyren was unduly harsh.
his order for your beheading is hereby overturned.
bless you, Mother Confessor.
Kahlan, I believe we can do more to mitigate this man's loss.
just a moment, Zedd.
his hand was removed because he stole grain.
I had to. To feed my family.
but you stole that grain from another family.
Yes, Mother Confessor.
then according to the code of Aydindril, cutting off your hand was the fitting punishment.
I'm afraid I can't let the Wizard restore it.
Kahlan, are you sure?
I've made my decision.
she's changed since I last saw her.
she's changed since this morning.
my men have returned nearly all the fines I collected.
they have orders not to stop until they've paid everyone back.
for now.
see to it that all the released prisoners get home safely.
Yes, mistress.
I thought you'd be feasting on lamb at Ambrosio's Tavern by now.
and miss watching the Mother Confessor bring justice back to Aydindril?
not even for Ambrosio's.
there's still so much to set right.
why didn't you allow me to restore that young man's hand?
he stole grain from another family.
with his hand he could have worked to repay them.
according to the code of Aydindril
you know better than I do that those barbaric codes haven't been enforced for hundreds of years.
Yes, and look at the Midlands now.
Zedd, I did not come here to grant amnesty to thieves and petty criminals.
I came here to abolish a corrupt system.
to bring back the rule of law.
if I start making exceptions the rules will lose their meaning.
in the past, you've always been one to err on the side of mercy.
what you call "mercy" is a stone's throw from chaos.
do you think I'm being unreasonable?
not unreasonable, just very different from the Kahlan Amnell I know.
before, my duty was to protect Richard.
here, I'm the leader.
I have to have the people's respect.
I hope I have yours.
always, Kahlan.
thank you.
what's wrong? You all right?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine, everything's fine. I just
I need to talk to you.
alone.
we're going to take a walk.
I couldn't sleep.
I kept thinking: I don't have my powers
I know, but-- - No, no.
no, Richard, it's not that, I
I don't know if I'm going to get them back tomorrow or ever.
but right now...
this could be our only chance.
are you saying-- ?
Yes.
if you want to.
you asked to see me, mistress?
before you were confessed, your motives were greedy and selfish, and your methods unlawful.
forgive me, mistress.
however, you also showed great strength and leadership.
you took the D'Harans out of Aydindril.
you easily unseated the Council.
you come from a line of kings and great warriors.
you meet the qualifications to sire the next Confessor.
mistress, I'm honored.
I'll please you in ways you can't imagine.
hm. I doubt that. But you can try.
Oh, that won't be necessary.
just take off your clothes.
the sun's coming up.
are you sure? I think that's the moon.
Cara's going to be wondering where we are.
I think Cara can figure it out.
can you imagine what it would be like to be ordinary people?
you mean the kind that sleep in beds in houses?
Yes, yes.
and who make each other breakfast in the morning and kiss their children goodnight.
the kind that have time to go see the Falls of Aldermont at sunset.
do you ever think about that?
every day.
I wish we didn't have to go.
me too.
I'll meet you back at the campsite.
this is Aydindril. If we go through the Rang'Shada mountains we won't have to cross the Kael river.
there's a bridge after the river forks. It might be faster.
we'll go that way, then.
that was a long walk you took.
what are you two doing?
we're just discussing whether to go through the mountains or across the river.
you had your hands all over him.
I was taking a leaf out of his hair.
I may not have my powers, but I have eyes, Cara.
I know what I saw.
you can't stand that Richard and I were together last night.
why would I care?
do you think I don't see how you look at him?
I'd die for you, Richard.
how can I serve you,Richard?
any trouble planting the evidence, Mr. Kreese?
should turn up in his office within 36 hours.
I don't think this one's going to work.
the guy's clean.
now. Our friend the state's attorney is clean now, but he did a stint in juvenile detention, another in drug rehab.
all we have to do is add a whiff of scandal and let the media follow the trail all the way back to those old sins.
but who cares?
the public loves him.
the public has been lied to, Mr. Kreese.
told all their lives they can have the good life, but no one ever gets it.
every year, they work a little longer, and their house is worth a little less, their retirement fund gets a little smaller.
and when the people get upset, they start looking for someone to blame, someone they can take down.
the public has to love him, otherwise, none of this works.
only our heroes fall, Mr. Kreese.
the rich and powerful take what they want.
we steal it back for you.
sometimes, bad guys make the best good guys.
we provide...Leverage.
so, this 13-year-old future State's Attorney steals a concession worker's uniform, we go from food stand to food stand telling them that we've run out of franks in the right-field bleachers --It works.
and they never caught on? - No.
only after we had scammed more free food than we'd eat in a season.
I remember they asked us for our ticket stubs.
which, by the way, we didn't have because we hopped the turnstiles.
Then...they asked to speak to our fathers.
and Nate says -- I'll never forget this
he says, "Who do you think taught us to hop the stiles in the first place? "
I've never tried to hide how bad things got for me when I was a kid.
but I put the drugs behind me, walked a straight line ever since -- swear on my mother.
okay.
so...
so, this guy, Reed Rockwell -- - Professional career assassin.
he represents your opponent in the next election.
he sends you these photographs along with a note.
then the next day, an aide finds a bottle of Vicodin in your office.
it wasn't mine.
okay.
I broke an ankle playing ball with my kids a few years back.
I wouldn't even take the painkillers the doctor prescribed.
but now all this character Rockwell has to do is file a lawsuit against you
anything -- a fender-bender...
and then the aide has to come forward about the Vicodin, and these photographs -- real or fake --come out in discovery.
legal blackmail. It's elegant.
it's, uh, it's wrong, is what it is.
can I have another...
coming right up, sir. - Thanks. Do you want some?
there you go.
sometimes I don't know who's done more for the people around here, Nate
you or me.
well...
I need you now.
I don't know what to do.
go home, Ed. I got this.
I'm going to get my team to bury this guy Rockwell.
you got my word.
Rockwell is bulletproof.
of course. The man is all about C. G.
I mean, maybe -- maybe
you can get some quality C. G. in a still-frame, but when I lay down my ten-fifty old-school practical
stop -- stop with the "Star Trek" stuff again!
wars! Damn it, it's "Star Wars " .
and -- and that C. G.I. Yoda they used in the prequels is an insult to the puppet they --You know what, man?
it's not even worth discussing.
you're the only one discussing it.
I kind of like C. G.I. Yoda.
Hey, Hardison, what do we got on this guy Rockwell?
look, Parker, just tell him what he wants to hear.
did my ears...
all right, Nate. We're scraping rock bottom here.
this guy does crisis P. R. and the whole thing's done on the whisper.
he doesn't just defend his clients, he attacks their enemies -- by any means necessary.
creating dirt where he can't find any.
okay, but, guys, I mean, we've done this kind of thing before.
video, photo frame-ups...
not like this, Nate.
this man is like a ninja assassin.
he's turned it into an art form.
we're talking politicians, Hollywood starlets, even cheating spouses.
you know, word is, Rockwell made his bones a few years back by taking down a congressman.
you see, the rep received some serious praise for the speech that he gave that introduced a bill in D. C. right?
Rockwell, the genius that he is, goes and writes a fake political essay, back-dates it, and then bribes a clerk to file it in the Library of Congress.
Rockwell leaks the news that the rep plagiarized the essay, the bill dies, and so does the congressman's career.
well, he knew that no one in D. C. was gonna admit to not having read that essay, and how the public were gonna respond.
Yeah, and how to manipulate the media.
Oh, yeah.
Rockwell's brilliant. He's ruthless.
stone-cold solid.
it's a shame we got to take the man down.
I'd almost consider making him a part of the team.
Yeah, uh, Rockwell has his boot on my friend's throat, Hardison.
I said, "almost " .
listen, what do we know about him personally?
nothing.
his online footprint is scrubbed clean.
website has an e-mail box, the corporate website -- that's it -- no phone.
only way I found the office address was by tracing back some old business-license application.
Yeah, we can tell you where he gets his morning coffee.
that's about it.
this is no good.
well, the usual play on a guy like this is to ruin his reputation, you know, undermine his credibility.
Yeah, but he has no reputation, so...
this guy's a ghost, Nate.
he operates like we do.
his clients are by referral, and he stays in the shadows.
how we supposed to take this guy down?
the same way we would destroy me.
I mean, what we're really asking here is, how would I destroy myself?
Yeah, and you can't say "booze." Hmm.
if somebody lives in the shadows, you want to bring them into the light.
I mean, what if we made this guy...famous?
no. Bad idea. - We shouldn't do that.
Nate's right.
it's a siren song.
who do we know that can resist the warmth of the spotlight?
we give him just one little taste.
first of all, we don't even know how this guy's gonna react, okay?
and say, what if it does blow up, huh?
what if we get too close to the spotlight?
look, Nate, we already got enough unwanted attention, a la somebody listening in on the apartment.
okay, here's the plan.
we are not gonna take Rockwell down.
we are gonna build him up.
we're gonna turn him into a hero.
we'll then find all the grimy little secrets that he has, and then we are going to discredit him, and no one will ever trust what he has to say about Ed Kelley.
I'm not gonna be able to unhear that "C. G.I. Yoda" thing.
cut me deep, woman. That cut me deep.
I can resist the spotlight, by the way.
of course you can.
never see you taking any kind of victory lap after you've pushed us all to the edge, or sticking around to gloat over the bad guy being dragged away.
hmm. Is that sarcasm?
a mild amount.
Hey! Hey! - Give me the purse.
give me the purse, lady, and nobody gets hurt.
Hey! That's my paycheck!
and my mother's medicine! Help!
Hey, leave her alone!
Really?
stop.
good job.
my baby! My baby!
help! Help!
wonder if that comes in a higher heel.
I choked on a hot dog.
On...purpose.
and Rockwell was checking his e-mail, and some huge dude came over and...
I-I got heimlich'ed.
Yeah, all right. All right, listen, guys.
this is gonna be harder than we thought.
who the hell shops here?
it's $3 a banana.
coffee, sir?
I don't think so. - Oh.
Hey, Nate.
can I just reiterate that I have almost no frame of reference for what I'm being asked to do here?
okay, both feeds are up.
Hardison, you're gonna be fine.
and...Here he comes...
right on schedule.
20 seconds, Hardison.
uh, medium half-caf Indonesian civet, with soy milk.
great. Just one moment.
okay, Hardison, you're up.
all right, everybody chill out. Just relax.
everybody calm down. Hey, hey!
shut up. Chill. Relax.
sir, go back to eating your scone.
everybody just cool out. Everybody calm down.
be cool.
you can go home with a story to tell your grandkids.
sir, please get back. Back up. I'm not playing.
now, look here. It's gonna go like this. Alright?
money in the bag. You know how it goes.
or I'm gonna start cappin' fools. I'm not playing.
Nate, I told you you should have let me do this.
come on, now. Faster.
you taking your time? - You're gonna get us all killed!
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What's up, cat?
okay, Hardison, you've got to get him away from the door.
where you going?
just let me get out of here with my coffee, man.
I'm sorry, I thought I'm the one that had the gun up in here.
W-what is this? What is -- Mmm.
moving into position.
this is disgusting. Sir, get your ass on.
get your ass.
should shoot you for your bad taste. Come on.
looks like I got me a little hostage for when the popo come.
how you want it, man -- east coast, west coast?
Hardison, don't hurt him.
you don't -- you don't want me.
I want you.
no, no, no. You don't want me.
when the cops get here, they see you got a male hostage -- no one's gonna care.
who's gonna watch that on the evening news, man? You -- you want her.
huh?
I'm telling you -- she'd make a much better hostage than me.
they'll be falling all over themselves giving you whatever you want.
you want her as a hostage.
she'd make a much better hostage -- - What?! No!
okay, Hardison. Hurt him as much as you like.
Eliot, now!
okay, we got it.
Hardison, when you finish your jog, I want you to scrub the footage.
I want to see his face clear as a bell.
Sophie, you stay with him. Stay in his pocket.
we got to get him to stick around and sign some autographs. - Uh, Nate?
what? - He's taking off.
this guy's not a hero.
no.
he's the only thing better than a hero.
he's a mystery.
now, that is a practical special effect.
no computer-generated cheat.
that's something the audience can really invest in.
Oh, you see that?
boss move, ain't it?
what do we got on the web?
Whoa! 320, 000 hits?
Mm-hmm.
and that's just in a few hours, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm fixing to add another zero to that by tonight!
how?
well, you see, in order to share our video with people all over the virtual world, you first have to be confirmed as somebody's friend or contact...
unless you're me.
security was a holy terror, but I managed to upload a worm that will backdoor this dummy profile into users' friend lists and expand this network at a geometric rate.
so, "underhill24601..."
just made 11 million friends today.
this man saved my life.
reports are in about a rare instance of true heroism, where a man foiled an armed robbery in a local coffee shop.
Mr. Rockwell, sir, you're on the news.
...who is this as of yet unidentified hero?
this "Venti Vigilante," as he's being called...
it's a mistake. Turn it off. Get back to work.
though our sources here at WODC are still searching high and low to track him down.
Hey, hey. That's him.
Oh, hey, man. That's the guy.
come on. Go ahead.
a medium half-caf Indonesian civet, with soy milk --On the house.
thank you. - Thank you.
Hey. Hey! You.
I know you.
Yeah, man, I know this guy. You're -- you're a hero.
Really? The slow clap? - Yeah. Yeah, man.
that's stupid. - I got them all the time in high school.
you didn't get one of those in high school? - For jackass of the year?
...the man who, at great risk to himself, disarmed and chased off a masked gunman...
my friends over there said you're famous. Is that true?
are you a drummer or something?
no. - Or are you one of those big Internet-company guys, like the kids in that movie?
um, you might have seen me on the...TV.
Oh, TV star.
Squee.
my friends are throwing a party this weekend.
call me.
okay.
Cheers. - Mm.
now. Call me now -- So I have your phone number in my phone.
you're not dialing.
Oh. Got it.
I think I'm getting better at this.
I'm cloning Rockwell's cell right now.
good work, girl.
I didn't even stab him.
Yeah. We are so proud of you.
Uh...No-stabbing wednesdays -- new tradition.
thank God for an appointment.
maybe we can get back to life around here.
what business is he in?
I'm in the household-name business, Mr. Rockwell. Just a sec.
Yeah, uh, cancel it.
congresswoman ends up on my schedule one more time, I'm gonna have to fire you.
gotta go.
Gillis. Henry K. Gillis. How do you do?
all right.
nothing to worry about.
a little rough around the edges, but we can work with that.
you're a media consultant.
same line of work as you are, except I build people up.
nobody better at it than me.
then why have I never heard of you?
well, the same reason I've never heard of you until I turned on my TV last night --Careful design.
laws, sausages, and celebrities, kid.
a lot easier to control the spotlight when you're not standing in it.
well, then, with all due respect, Mr. Gillis...
...why would I want to be standing in it?
Mr. Rockwell, one question!
thank you. Thank you. You got no choice.
what are you up to now, 2 million YouTube hits?
I mean, this thing -- it's not gonna go away.
now, the media, they're gonna hound you day and night
you know that, we both know that -- until you give them something, or they'll make something up on their own.
now, listen. I know you, Rockwell.
you can't be satisfied just standing just outside the spotlight forever.
nobody ever is.
these people that you take down, they don't deserve their wealth, their fame --You do.
you're better than they are.
don't abandon this opportunity
this opportunity to step out of the shadows and onto the stage.
trying to convince a man to step onto the third rail.
without getting too close to it himself.
your public wants to meet you.
that's because you're gonna tell them I'm someone they want to meet.
the public will buy any lie we push on them.
they still believe the good life is out there.
look, I'll tell you what. Why don't you give me a week?
let me show you what I can do.
you know, I already got you booked on "Washington Week " .
that's not even the highest-rated political show in its slot.
three stages, my friend -- pundit, sage, and guru.
'Washington Week" is fertile ground.
you make a splash, you drop some controversial comments.
I mean, you do that on the highest-rated show, you know, the hair-dos, they'll be coming after you guns a-blazin'.
this way, I gain some traction.
you gain some traction. Exactly.
now, you play this right, pick every punch, we're gonna ride this wave all the way to the top.
you are gonna be swimming in a river of money.
just don't give them your best stuff until we -- we get the 7-figure book deal.
are you with me so far?
because...I would like to start this off with a bang.
now, my team has already secured an auditorium --standing room only, place is packed --to listen to you tonight give a motivational speech on ordinary heroism.
we do?
Oh, yeah, just as soon as you get a place and clear it out.
run a background check on Gillis here.
I want to know everything.
he's in.
background check -- got it. Nate, we're on it.
all right. Do this right, guys, we got him.
we're right on the verge.
Yep.
I mean, you know, he took the bait.
I mean, it's the only way to fix Ed Kelley's whole
wait. You're not doing this for Ed Kelley.
you're pushing this hard 'cause of Rockwell.
you know, you want to do a confidential client list, phone records, and financials.
Nate, I got it.
he works from the shadows deciding who to take down, convinced he's making the world a better place, implying a certain moral superiority over his victims.
any of this sound like someone we know? - That's good!
but, no, you got all that right, but I think you want to be careful you don't make me a little bit too
Hey, look, if there's nothing embarrassing for him to find on you, it makes you look like you're not for real.
I know, but here's the thing.
you are saying that I helped the dictator of Mogutu rise to power.
he committed genocide, Hardison.
problem?
apparently not.
don't get so focused on him, you forget the bigger game.
we all know that fame's a monster, and here you are poking at it with a stick.
uh, Eliot, Parker, how we doing on the seminar?
well, it takes time, Nate.
there's over 100 motivational speeches in Boston every day.
like "Emotion is Your Friend " .
Ooh! That's good.
aspire or Expire.
this woman right here --She talks for two hours about all the things she misses doing with her kids on an average day. Look.
why, did they die?
no. No. They just...went to college.
all right, stop. Stop.
back away from the brochures.
back away from the brochures!
guys, guys, guys. Can we please speed this up?
time is a factor here.
well, what do you want me to do, Nate? Huh?
how's this guy gonna play to a crowd that shows up for...
you can't love him until you love you?
we should go to that one, anyway.
well, the guy we're clearing out was a fireman for 43 years and just donated a kidney to his best friend.
we're not gonna hurt him.
I'm just saying, it's lucky we don't believe in hell.
Nate believes in hell. Shoot, I believe in hell.
Oh, yeah.
Mr. Jamison!
what an honor! - Ah. Hello.
80 years old and still saving lives.
this way, please. - Oh.
Ah, just right through here.
come on, let's go.
Where's my speech?
the auditorium is through here, Mr. Jamison.
I have to warn you -- the lights are gonna be very, very bright.
you're not gonna be able to make out any of the faces in the auditorium, but just pick a spot on the back -- Ooh.
on the back of the wall, and just let it rip.
ladies and gentlemen
wow, what a fantastic turnout.
thank you so much for coming.
I give you the man who did something that made a difference!
hello.
Oh, my.
it's terribly bright. I can't see any of you.
all right, Hardison, how'd that speech come out?
Oh, it's some of my finest work.
how is he?
well, building people up isn't exactly his thing.
all right, Rockwell. Hey.
listen.
now, this is not some corporate snoozer with a bunch of bored-to-tears executives.
these people paid good money to be inspired.
what am I supposed to do with this?
you can be a hero, too.Who the hell wrote this crap?
excuse you?
let's see you do better on such short notice.
people are just ungrateful.
listen. Do you have any idea why these people are here?
do you have any idea why everybody wants a piece of you?
because everything you ever wanted in your life is at your fingertips right now!
the good life.
this "crap" -- this is how you get what you want.
everything you want is in front of this audience...
...Reed Rockwell. - ...right now.
recognition, validation
those are the things that are gonna fill that hole that is somewhere deep inside you, take away the pain.
now, you go out there and take it!
I...I-I don't even know what I'm doing up here.
I just...
I-I didn't have my caffeine yet one morning, and...
you can be a hero, too.
we -- we all like to think that when we find ourselves in the heat of danger -- the moment of truth
when we have to make a decision and act, that we will rise to the occasion, but I'll let you in on a little secret.
I wasn't sure that I could.
we all have phenomenal capacities to do good, to make the world a better place
more than we give ourselves credit for.
I'm the one with the cameras pointed at me, but...
there's heroism everywhere, in each and every one of you.
we can all be heroes.
thank you.
Wow. They love him.
even better than that, Nate
the amount of tweets and status updates that have come in since the speech
they're talking about him.
how'd I do? Masterful!
better than I ever dreamed. I'm telling you, we're gonna go on to the next step now.
news interviews, everything -- but no time to waste.
now, I'm gonna set up meetings -- - Nate.
Oh. Yeah. I'm talking to my client right now.
Hey, tell him that "Washington Week" called.
Yeah.
listen, something huge is going on.
I'm working on something really big.
so I'm gonna work the phones for about an hour.
why don't you go to the office?
and I'll meet you there in about an hour.
okay, what can I do?
what you can do is start jotting down things for your memoir.
the Venti Vigilante has been identified as Reed Rockwell...
Hey. Phones are ringing off the hook.
the Globe wants to do an interview with you.
corporate speaking gigs are lining up.
and CNN would like to do a story.
they want to bring you in end of the week.
you know, we can just do a background check and kind of, you know, wait for the YouTube hits to pile up.
background check?
Oh, yeah, nothing to worry about. They just want to bring you in, see if they like you, put you on tape, that kind of thing.
good day's work.
morning, Hardison.
we're in the homestretch.
we're going to take this guy to the national level, create and leak falsified evidence against him.
and we'll take him down hard.
Rockwell just withdrew 25 grand from his account in small bills.
why would he need so much hard cash?
don't know. It doesn't sound like a positive development.
what do you want us to do?
follow the money.
why wouldn't you let me drive?
this is my car.
all right, Nate. We just got off at Lowell, about 20 minutes out.
tailing Rockwell's friend with the suitcase full of money.
hometown?
Rockwell's not from Lowell. He's from Methuen.
went to Tenney.
illegitimate kid.
or Reed used to be Rita.
what? We were all thinking it.
Really? That's like the line right there, and you just cartwheel
could have been a woman. All right, guys, guys, guys, guys.
so we have no idea what Rockwell's up to here.
Hey, I wonder if Nate still thinks he's got all the angles of this fame thing covered.
you know, Sophie, I can hear you.
Really?
go away. I'm going to call the cops. - Mr. Rockwell
okay. There's a woman in a trailer who's arguing with Rockwell's thug.
I think this is gonna get physical in about 30 seconds.
open the door -- Now!
get out of my house!
who the hell are you?
neighborhood watch.
Eliot, let him go.
until that guy showed up on my front steps,
I hadn't heard from Reed Rockwell in forever.
how did you know him?
he grew up a couple towns over.
he dated a girl from my class.
night of the prom, me and my boyfriend, P. J. were in a car with Reed and this girl Missy, all blitzed out of our mind.
and we got into an accident...
and Missy was killed.
I wonder why he's trying to buy her silence.
this is all that comes up about the accident.
wasn't even mentioned in the Globe, only local papers.
Rockwell's worried about a background check.
Rockwell -- he knows how to prey on people's dark secrets, cause he has one himself.
I think that Rockwell was driving the car and afterwards, made it look like he wasn't.
Rockwell the one driving?
I swear. I even took a picture...
of everybody from the backseat after we left the party.
but he was never arrested.
no.
I don't understand what happened.
when I took the camera to the police a couple of days later, the negative showed P. J. In the driver's seat.
what? It works.
P. J. went to jail for vehicular manslaughter.
and Reed Rockwell went free.
P. J. would have never been driving that car if he had been drinking. You have to be
he had a wrestling scholarship waiting for him at B. C.
he was talking about proposing.
I've been trying to tell the cops this for the last 14 years.
okay, we got it. Now, here, Rockwell is in the passenger's seat, and he's smiling.
Hardison, is there any way that Rockwell could have doctored the film negative?
we're talking prehistoric technology.
he'd have to switch out the entire roll, put in a new one with the same pictures, except the one he changed.
it's epic but not impossible.
Nate, this girl's got almost nothing.
you didn't take the money, Emma.
I don't want anything from Reed Rockwell.
he sends a guy here with 25k...
...trying to get me to stay quiet about the accident.
I told him to get lost.
look, thanks for...talking to us.
Yeah.
you guys know Rockwell?
is he famous or something?
we're gonna make sure of it.
okay, I want you two to go get the doctored film negative from the police evidence archive.
do whatever you have to do. Just get it.
Oh, man.
can you find the ark of the covenant back there?
how am I supposed to find anything?
I don't know.
afternoon, ma'am. How you doing?
I'm writing a piece for the Police Gazette, right?
on the unsung heroes of the justice system.
the civilians like yourself who keep the archives from...catching fire.
will you be needing any photographs for your piece, mister...
Par...dison -- "Pardison" is my name.
that's Pardison -- it's Swahili. Um...
I've noticed that you have a very unconventional filing system for your archive.
so, where would one such as myself find, like, a-a prosecutor from the late '90s, like a...
90s ... - ...Tom Randall?
Oh, him!
I keep him right back there.
back -- back -- him
he's in the southeast corner?
in...
what was that, Mr. Pardison?
I didn't sa-- I said -- I said what you said.
him -- he's in the southeast corner?
Oh, dear.
ha! It's dusty. Caught the back of my throat, right up in there, right up in there.
you know what?
I-I think I'm gonna actually go ahead and get some pictures, to -- Yeah.
so, all right. You take care.
a-all right. - All right.
all right. - All right. Bye-bye.
we can still make this work.
I don't know why I'm sitting here listening to a new plan.
well, the first one's not going all that well.
this playing-with-fame thing -- it's reckless.
you're not controlling the mark.
all right, we're operating without a net.
somebody's gonna get hurt.
Eliot, why don't you just take the rest of the job off?
consciously or not, I think you look at Reed Rockwell and see everything you hate about Nathan
any way I can get you to not finish that thought?
every time something goes wrong, you push harder, and now you're pushing to ruin Rockwell so hard, you're going to end up ruining yourself.
maybe that's what you're trying to do.
I think he developed and then took a new shot of every picture on the roll.
the one he alters right here in the middle, man
I mean, the tech at the time was primitive at best, but it's really a seamless job.
just skip to the last page, please.
we're not gonna be able to nail Rockwell for the car accident.
what do you mean it didn't work?
how the hell did you screw this up?!!
there was somebody with her.
somebody?
he -- he beat me up with the screen door.
What?!
is that girl's life really only worth $25, 000, Reed?
how's about 14 years of prison for my man?
that part of the payoff?
see, after your friend left,
I started looking through some things from back then, and I found a picture you may have missed.
pretty sure it's worth more than 25k.
tell me what figure you had in mind.
how's about 250?
or what?
or you go to the local news.
or I talk to the first reporter who will take my call.
do you have any idea who you're screwing with?
I'll be in an old Buick.
you wait for me under the bridge.
you got one hour.
and it better be you personally, Reed.
climb into the back of the car, hand over the money
I hand you the evidence, you get out of the car.
simple as that.
very good. - You did great.
he's all yours, Nate.
looks like I missed something.
calm down, Rockwell. Use your words.
if there's a problem, we'll fix it.
I'm being blackmailed!
this bitch I knew half a lifetime ago
14 years -- she just...
I-I was in a car accident in high school.
this girl I know got killed. We were all drunk.
I was not the one driving. I swear to God.
but the cops came.
I was still on the scene.
and now -- now
this girl who was in the car with us wants 250 grand...
...or she's gonna go public and say that I was the one at the wheel.
that's really something.
look. Look, I-I already tried to make this go away.
not hard enough. Sit down.
we are at the goal line here, Rockwell.
now, you can't afford to have a scandal like this.
we both know that it doesn't matter if it's trumped up or real.
look. This request...
for the $250, 000...
maybe it's not such a bad thing. - What?
W-what are you talking about?
comparatively, it is a lot of money, but it means that the girl doesn't want to string this out over a bunch of payments.
she wants to take the money now and disappear.
okay? You both win.
no, Gillis...
she wins.
I'm out $250, 000!
I wouldn't worry about that.
I mean, look, you'll make that money back in a month of speaking engagements, you know, one week of book signings.
don't worry about that. The thing is this -- you are now...
you're not in the shadows anymore, Rockwell.
okay?
you are -- you are at the whim of the media.
and we both know what they'll do with a story like this.
no way I'm letting that bitch get away with this.
she gives me her evidence,
I get out of her car...
...you make sure this is over.
take the land rover. - You got it.
long time, Emma.
just hand over the photo.
Hey. Hey! What are you doing?
what the... Where the hell are we going?!
to get the evidence. I wasn't stupid enough to bring it with me!
just pull the damn car over!
this is amateur crap.
wait. Wait, I know you from the
I've seen you before. I
what the hell is going on here?!
Oh, my God.
Oh, not again.
not again. Not again.
where the hell are you, Kreese?
I'm back at the office. Give me a call the second you...
evening, Mr. Rockwell.
why are you trying to deny this, Mr. Rockwell?
because I didn't cause any accident.
I was the victim. I just got finished telling you.
what, did you pull that badge out of a cereal box?
give me the keys.
any interest in changing your statement there, Froot Loops?
what is this? - Oh, those are your phone records, Rockwell.
which show dozens of calls and texts to the number of that girl who was in that car you just smacked up.
call me now -- so I have your phone...
Oh. Got it.
I'm cloning Rockwell's cell right now.
cute little blond girl like that
what, were you stalking her?
see, what we're getting at here is called intent.
I was -- I was not stalking that girl.
I-I hardly knew her. The only reason I was in her car is 'cause she was trying to blackmail me. I swear to God!
blackmailing you? - Yes.
for this drunk-driving accident 14 years ago.
no, I wasn't at fault!
for which accident?! - Neither!
you guys have -- my briefcase.
get my briefcase. There's 250 grand in there.
it's the payoff money.
it'll prove that she was trying to extort
would that be this briefcase?
wait. How...
sleep tight, my man.
I-I...
no. No, no, no.
this evidence has been digitally altered!
this is not the real photograph. I-I...
tell me about it.
state's Attorney Kelley personally oversaw the Lowell native's release after spending the last 14 years behind bars for a crime he didn't commit.
think they're happy now
wait till they see what's in that briefcase waiting at home for them.
enough to fix their screen door.
couple hundred thousand of them.
...Yet sadness over the death of an innocent girl - in the car accident... - All right.
it was reckless.
it was worth it.
Yeah, this time.
bet you're starting to like that C. G.I. Yoda a little bit now?
Yeah, when he gives back the childhood he stole from me.
why don't you just ask me to join the dark side? Go ahead.
well, Nate, winning isn't everything.
you know, for a while there, you were an honest man.
and then for a while, you were a thief.
Yeah, maybe I'm both.
you can't be both.
I'm just not sure at this point which one I want to win.
now to return to one of the top stories tonight, of Reed Rockwell, whose foiling of a coffee-house robbery on Tuesday was overshadowed by his arrest and subsequent confession.
new evidence suggests that Rockwell was the driver who caused the accident...
...that resulted in P. J. Tiernan's incarceration - 14 years ago. - Yeah.
Mr. Ford, that was a hell of a piece of work.
the gentleman that was listening in on my apartment, I presume.
wiretaps without warrants are a felony.
listen, here's the thing.
we had some outstanding contracts with Mr. Rockwell.
I don't suppose you'd consider taking them on for a substantial fee.
I don't work that way.
you honestly don't, do you?
you actually think you're one of the good guys.
you care to talk this over face-to-face?
congratulations again.
getting rid of scum like Rockwell
you made the world a better place.
and information from the original accident scene states that Rockwell was under the influence of alcohol at the time.
and in a bizarre twist,
Rockwell was caught on a local traffic camera tonight causing yet another car accident.
any trouble planting the evidence, Mr. Kreese?
should turn up in his office within 36 hours.
I don't think this one's going to work.
the guy's clean.
now. Our friend the state's attorney is clean now, but he did a stint in juvenile detention, another in drug rehab.
all we have to do is add a whiff of scandal and let the media follow the trail all the way back to those old sins.
but who cares?
the public loves him.
the public has been lied to, Mr. Kreese.
told all their lives they can have the good life, but no one ever gets it.
every year, they work a little longer, and their house is worth a little less, their retirement fund gets a little smaller.
and when the people get upset, they start looking for someone to blame, someone they can take down.
the public has to love him, otherwise, none of this works.
only our heroes fall, Mr. Kreese.
the rich and powerful take what they want.
we steal it back for you.
sometimes, bad guys make the best good guys.
we provide...Leverage.
so, this 13-year-old future State's Attorney steals a concession worker's uniform, we go from food stand to food stand telling them that we've run out of franks in the right-field bleachers --It works.
and they never caught on? - No.
only after we had scammed more free food than we'd eat in a season.
I remember they asked us for our ticket stubs.
which, by the way, we didn't have because we hopped the turnstiles.
Then...they asked to speak to our fathers.
and Nate says -- I'll never forget this
he says, "Who do you think taught us to hop the stiles in the first place? "
I've never tried to hide how bad things got for me when I was a kid.
but I put the drugs behind me, walked a straight line ever since -- swear on my mother.
okay.
so...
so, this guy, Reed Rockwell -- - Professional career assassin.
he represents your opponent in the next election.
he sends you these photographs along with a note.
then the next day, an aide finds a bottle of Vicodin in your office.
it wasn't mine.
okay.
I broke an ankle playing ball with my kids a few years back.
I wouldn't even take the painkillers the doctor prescribed.
but now all this character Rockwell has to do is file a lawsuit against you
anything -- a fender-bender...
and then the aide has to come forward about the Vicodin, and these photographs -- real or fake --come out in discovery.
legal blackmail. It's elegant.
it's, uh, it's wrong, is what it is.
can I have another...
coming right up, sir. - Thanks. Do you want some?
there you go.
sometimes I don't know who's done more for the people around here, Nate
you or me.
well...
I need you now.
I don't know what to do.
go home, Ed. I got this.
I'm going to get my team to bury this guy Rockwell.
you got my word.
Rockwell is bulletproof.
of course. The man is all about C. G.
I mean, maybe -- maybe
you can get some quality C. G. in a still-frame, but when I lay down my ten-fifty old-school practical
stop -- stop with the "Star Trek" stuff again!
wars! Damn it, it's "Star Wars " .
and -- and that C. G.I. Yoda they used in the prequels is an insult to the puppet they --You know what, man?
it's not even worth discussing.
you're the only one discussing it.
I kind of like C. G.I. Yoda.
Hey, Hardison, what do we got on this guy Rockwell?
look, Parker, just tell him what he wants to hear.
did my ears...
all right, Nate. We're scraping rock bottom here.
this guy does crisis P. R. and the whole thing's done on the whisper.
he doesn't just defend his clients, he attacks their enemies -- by any means necessary.
creating dirt where he can't find any.
okay, but, guys, I mean, we've done this kind of thing before.
video, photo frame-ups...
not like this, Nate.
this man is like a ninja assassin.
he's turned it into an art form.
we're talking politicians, Hollywood starlets, even cheating spouses.
you know, word is, Rockwell made his bones a few years back by taking down a congressman.
you see, the rep received some serious praise for the speech that he gave that introduced a bill in D. C. right?
Rockwell, the genius that he is, goes and writes a fake political essay, back-dates it, and then bribes a clerk to file it in the Library of Congress.
Rockwell leaks the news that the rep plagiarized the essay, the bill dies, and so does the congressman's career.
well, he knew that no one in D. C. was gonna admit to not having read that essay, and how the public were gonna respond.
Yeah, and how to manipulate the media.
Oh, yeah.
Rockwell's brilliant. He's ruthless.
stone-cold solid.
it's a shame we got to take the man down.
I'd almost consider making him a part of the team.
Yeah, uh, Rockwell has his boot on my friend's throat, Hardison.
I said, "almost " .
listen, what do we know about him personally?
nothing.
his online footprint is scrubbed clean.
website has an e-mail box, the corporate website -- that's it -- no phone.
only way I found the office address was by tracing back some old business-license application.
Yeah, we can tell you where he gets his morning coffee.
that's about it.
this is no good.
well, the usual play on a guy like this is to ruin his reputation, you know, undermine his credibility.
Yeah, but he has no reputation, so...
this guy's a ghost, Nate.
he operates like we do.
his clients are by referral, and he stays in the shadows.
how we supposed to take this guy down?
the same way we would destroy me.
I mean, what we're really asking here is, how would I destroy myself?
Yeah, and you can't say "booze." Hmm.
if somebody lives in the shadows, you want to bring them into the light.
I mean, what if we made this guy...famous?
no. Bad idea. - We shouldn't do that.
Nate's right.
it's a siren song.
who do we know that can resist the warmth of the spotlight?
we give him just one little taste.
first of all, we don't even know how this guy's gonna react, okay?
and say, what if it does blow up, huh?
what if we get too close to the spotlight?
look, Nate, we already got enough unwanted attention, a la somebody listening in on the apartment.
okay, here's the plan.
we are not gonna take Rockwell down.
we are gonna build him up.
we're gonna turn him into a hero.
we'll then find all the grimy little secrets that he has, and then we are going to discredit him, and no one will ever trust what he has to say about Ed Kelley.
I'm not gonna be able to unhear that "C. G.I. Yoda" thing.
cut me deep, woman. That cut me deep.
I can resist the spotlight, by the way.
of course you can.
never see you taking any kind of victory lap after you've pushed us all to the edge, or sticking around to gloat over the bad guy being dragged away.
hmm. Is that sarcasm?
a mild amount.
Hey! Hey! - Give me the purse.
give me the purse, lady, and nobody gets hurt.
Hey! That's my paycheck!
and my mother's medicine! Help!
Hey, leave her alone!
Really?
stop.
good job.
my baby! My baby!
help! Help!
wonder if that comes in a higher heel.
I choked on a hot dog.
On...purpose.
and Rockwell was checking his e-mail, and some huge dude came over and...
I-I got heimlich'ed.
Yeah, all right. All right, listen, guys.
this is gonna be harder than we thought.
who the hell shops here?
it's $3 a banana.
coffee, sir?
I don't think so. - Oh.
Hey, Nate.
can I just reiterate that I have almost no frame of reference for what I'm being asked to do here?
okay, both feeds are up.
Hardison, you're gonna be fine.
and...Here he comes...
right on schedule.
20 seconds, Hardison.
uh, medium half-caf Indonesian civet, with soy milk.
great. Just one moment.
okay, Hardison, you're up.
all right, everybody chill out. Just relax.
everybody calm down. Hey, hey!
shut up. Chill. Relax.
sir, go back to eating your scone.
everybody just cool out. Everybody calm down.
be cool.
you can go home with a story to tell your grandkids.
sir, please get back. Back up. I'm not playing.
now, look here. It's gonna go like this. Alright?
money in the bag. You know how it goes.
or I'm gonna start cappin' fools. I'm not playing.
Nate, I told you you should have let me do this.
come on, now. Faster.
you taking your time? - You're gonna get us all killed!
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What's up, cat?
okay, Hardison, you've got to get him away from the door.
where you going?
just let me get out of here with my coffee, man.
I'm sorry, I thought I'm the one that had the gun up in here.
W-what is this? What is -- Mmm.
moving into position.
this is disgusting. Sir, get your ass on.
get your ass.
should shoot you for your bad taste. Come on.
looks like I got me a little hostage for when the popo come.
how you want it, man -- east coast, west coast?
Hardison, don't hurt him.
you don't -- you don't want me.
I want you.
no, no, no. You don't want me.
when the cops get here, they see you got a male hostage -- no one's gonna care.
who's gonna watch that on the evening news, man? You -- you want her.
huh?
I'm telling you -- she'd make a much better hostage than me.
they'll be falling all over themselves giving you whatever you want.
you want her as a hostage.
she'd make a much better hostage -- - What?! No!
okay, Hardison. Hurt him as much as you like.
Eliot, now!
okay, we got it.
Hardison, when you finish your jog, I want you to scrub the footage.
I want to see his face clear as a bell.
Sophie, you stay with him. Stay in his pocket.
we got to get him to stick around and sign some autographs. - Uh, Nate?
what? - He's taking off.
this guy's not a hero.
no.
he's the only thing better than a hero.
he's a mystery.
now, that is a practical special effect.
no computer-generated cheat.
that's something the audience can really invest in.
Oh, you see that?
boss move, ain't it?
what do we got on the web?
Whoa! 320, 000 hits?
Mm-hmm.
and that's just in a few hours, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm fixing to add another zero to that by tonight!
how?
well, you see, in order to share our video with people all over the virtual world, you first have to be confirmed as somebody's friend or contact...
unless you're me.
security was a holy terror, but I managed to upload a worm that will backdoor this dummy profile into users' friend lists and expand this network at a geometric rate.
so, "underhill24601..."
just made 11 million friends today.
this man saved my life.
reports are in about a rare instance of true heroism, where a man foiled an armed robbery in a local coffee shop.
Mr. Rockwell, sir, you're on the news.
...who is this as of yet unidentified hero?
this "Venti Vigilante," as he's being called...
it's a mistake. Turn it off. Get back to work.
though our sources here at WODC are still searching high and low to track him down.
Hey, hey. That's him.
Oh, hey, man. That's the guy.
come on. Go ahead.
a medium half-caf Indonesian civet, with soy milk --On the house.
thank you. - Thank you.
Hey. Hey! You.
I know you.
Yeah, man, I know this guy. You're -- you're a hero.
Really? The slow clap? - Yeah. Yeah, man.
that's stupid. - I got them all the time in high school.
you didn't get one of those in high school? - For jackass of the year?
...the man who, at great risk to himself, disarmed and chased off a masked gunman...
my friends over there said you're famous. Is that true?
are you a drummer or something?
no. - Or are you one of those big Internet-company guys, like the kids in that movie?
um, you might have seen me on the...TV.
Oh, TV star.
Squee.
my friends are throwing a party this weekend.
call me.
okay.
Cheers. - Mm.
now. Call me now -- So I have your phone number in my phone.
you're not dialing.
Oh. Got it.
I think I'm getting better at this.
I'm cloning Rockwell's cell right now.
good work, girl.
I didn't even stab him.
Yeah. We are so proud of you.
Uh...No-stabbing wednesdays -- new tradition.
thank God for an appointment.
maybe we can get back to life around here.
what business is he in?
I'm in the household-name business, Mr. Rockwell. Just a sec.
Yeah, uh, cancel it.
congresswoman ends up on my schedule one more time, I'm gonna have to fire you.
gotta go.
Gillis. Henry K. Gillis. How do you do?
all right.
nothing to worry about.
a little rough around the edges, but we can work with that.
you're a media consultant.
same line of work as you are, except I build people up.
nobody better at it than me.
then why have I never heard of you?
well, the same reason I've never heard of you until I turned on my TV last night --Careful design.
laws, sausages, and celebrities, kid.
a lot easier to control the spotlight when you're not standing in it.
well, then, with all due respect, Mr. Gillis...
...why would I want to be standing in it?
Mr. Rockwell, one question!
thank you. Thank you. You got no choice.
what are you up to now, 2 million YouTube hits?
I mean, this thing -- it's not gonna go away.
now, the media, they're gonna hound you day and night
you know that, we both know that -- until you give them something, or they'll make something up on their own.
now, listen. I know you, Rockwell.
you can't be satisfied just standing just outside the spotlight forever.
nobody ever is.
these people that you take down, they don't deserve their wealth, their fame --You do.
you're better than they are.
don't abandon this opportunity
this opportunity to step out of the shadows and onto the stage.
trying to convince a man to step onto the third rail.
without getting too close to it himself.
your public wants to meet you.
that's because you're gonna tell them I'm someone they want to meet.
the public will buy any lie we push on them.
they still believe the good life is out there.
look, I'll tell you what. Why don't you give me a week?
let me show you what I can do.
you know, I already got you booked on "Washington Week " .
that's not even the highest-rated political show in its slot.
three stages, my friend -- pundit, sage, and guru.
'Washington Week" is fertile ground.
you make a splash, you drop some controversial comments.
I mean, you do that on the highest-rated show, you know, the hair-dos, they'll be coming after you guns a-blazin'.
this way, I gain some traction.
you gain some traction. Exactly.
now, you play this right, pick every punch, we're gonna ride this wave all the way to the top.
you are gonna be swimming in a river of money.
just don't give them your best stuff until we -- we get the 7-figure book deal.
are you with me so far?
because...I would like to start this off with a bang.
now, my team has already secured an auditorium --standing room only, place is packed --to listen to you tonight give a motivational speech on ordinary heroism.
we do?
Oh, yeah, just as soon as you get a place and clear it out.
run a background check on Gillis here.
I want to know everything.
he's in.
background check -- got it. Nate, we're on it.
all right. Do this right, guys, we got him.
we're right on the verge.
Yep.
I mean, you know, he took the bait.
I mean, it's the only way to fix Ed Kelley's whole
wait. You're not doing this for Ed Kelley.
you're pushing this hard 'cause of Rockwell.
you know, you want to do a confidential client list, phone records, and financials.
Nate, I got it.
he works from the shadows deciding who to take down, convinced he's making the world a better place, implying a certain moral superiority over his victims.
any of this sound like someone we know? - That's good!
but, no, you got all that right, but I think you want to be careful you don't make me a little bit too
Hey, look, if there's nothing embarrassing for him to find on you, it makes you look like you're not for real.
I know, but here's the thing.
you are saying that I helped the dictator of Mogutu rise to power.
he committed genocide, Hardison.
problem?
apparently not.
don't get so focused on him, you forget the bigger game.
we all know that fame's a monster, and here you are poking at it with a stick.
uh, Eliot, Parker, how we doing on the seminar?
well, it takes time, Nate.
there's over 100 motivational speeches in Boston every day.
like "Emotion is Your Friend " .
Ooh! That's good.
aspire or Expire.
this woman right here --She talks for two hours about all the things she misses doing with her kids on an average day. Look.
why, did they die?
no. No. They just...went to college.
all right, stop. Stop.
back away from the brochures.
back away from the brochures!
guys, guys, guys. Can we please speed this up?
time is a factor here.
well, what do you want me to do, Nate? Huh?
how's this guy gonna play to a crowd that shows up for...
you can't love him until you love you?
we should go to that one, anyway.
well, the guy we're clearing out was a fireman for 43 years and just donated a kidney to his best friend.
we're not gonna hurt him.
I'm just saying, it's lucky we don't believe in hell.
Nate believes in hell. Shoot, I believe in hell.
Oh, yeah.
Mr. Jamison!
what an honor! - Ah. Hello.
80 years old and still saving lives.
this way, please. - Oh.
Ah, just right through here.
come on, let's go.
Where's my speech?
the auditorium is through here, Mr. Jamison.
I have to warn you -- the lights are gonna be very, very bright.
you're not gonna be able to make out any of the faces in the auditorium, but just pick a spot on the back -- Ooh.
on the back of the wall, and just let it rip.
ladies and gentlemen
wow, what a fantastic turnout.
thank you so much for coming.
I give you the man who did something that made a difference!
hello.
Oh, my.
it's terribly bright. I can't see any of you.
all right, Hardison, how'd that speech come out?
Oh, it's some of my finest work.
how is he?
well, building people up isn't exactly his thing.
all right, Rockwell. Hey.
listen.
now, this is not some corporate snoozer with a bunch of bored-to-tears executives.
these people paid good money to be inspired.
what am I supposed to do with this?
you can be a hero, too.Who the hell wrote this crap?
excuse you?
let's see you do better on such short notice.
people are just ungrateful.
listen. Do you have any idea why these people are here?
do you have any idea why everybody wants a piece of you?
because everything you ever wanted in your life is at your fingertips right now!
the good life.
this "crap" -- this is how you get what you want.
everything you want is in front of this audience...
...Reed Rockwell. - ...right now.
recognition, validation
those are the things that are gonna fill that hole that is somewhere deep inside you, take away the pain.
now, you go out there and take it!
I...I-I don't even know what I'm doing up here.
I just...
I-I didn't have my caffeine yet one morning, and...
you can be a hero, too.
we -- we all like to think that when we find ourselves in the heat of danger -- the moment of truth
when we have to make a decision and act, that we will rise to the occasion, but I'll let you in on a little secret.
I wasn't sure that I could.
we all have phenomenal capacities to do good, to make the world a better place
more than we give ourselves credit for.
I'm the one with the cameras pointed at me, but...
there's heroism everywhere, in each and every one of you.
we can all be heroes.
thank you.
Wow. They love him.
even better than that, Nate
the amount of tweets and status updates that have come in since the speech
they're talking about him.
how'd I do? Masterful!
better than I ever dreamed. I'm telling you, we're gonna go on to the next step now.
news interviews, everything -- but no time to waste.
now, I'm gonna set up meetings -- - Nate.
Oh. Yeah. I'm talking to my client right now.
Hey, tell him that "Washington Week" called.
Yeah.
listen, something huge is going on.
I'm working on something really big.
so I'm gonna work the phones for about an hour.
why don't you go to the office?
and I'll meet you there in about an hour.
okay, what can I do?
what you can do is start jotting down things for your memoir.
the Venti Vigilante has been identified as Reed Rockwell...
Hey. Phones are ringing off the hook.
the Globe wants to do an interview with you.
corporate speaking gigs are lining up.
and CNN would like to do a story.
they want to bring you in end of the week.
you know, we can just do a background check and kind of, you know, wait for the YouTube hits to pile up.
background check?
Oh, yeah, nothing to worry about. They just want to bring you in, see if they like you, put you on tape, that kind of thing.
good day's work.
morning, Hardison.
we're in the homestretch.
we're going to take this guy to the national level, create and leak falsified evidence against him.
and we'll take him down hard.
Rockwell just withdrew 25 grand from his account in small bills.
why would he need so much hard cash?
don't know. It doesn't sound like a positive development.
what do you want us to do?
follow the money.
why wouldn't you let me drive?
this is my car.
all right, Nate. We just got off at Lowell, about 20 minutes out.
tailing Rockwell's friend with the suitcase full of money.
hometown?
Rockwell's not from Lowell. He's from Methuen.
went to Tenney.
illegitimate kid.
or Reed used to be Rita.
what? We were all thinking it.
Really? That's like the line right there, and you just cartwheel
could have been a woman. All right, guys, guys, guys, guys.
so we have no idea what Rockwell's up to here.
Hey, I wonder if Nate still thinks he's got all the angles of this fame thing covered.
you know, Sophie, I can hear you.
Really?
go away. I'm going to call the cops. - Mr. Rockwell
okay. There's a woman in a trailer who's arguing with Rockwell's thug.
I think this is gonna get physical in about 30 seconds.
open the door -- Now!
get out of my house!
who the hell are you?
neighborhood watch.
Eliot, let him go.
until that guy showed up on my front steps,
I hadn't heard from Reed Rockwell in forever.
how did you know him?
he grew up a couple towns over.
he dated a girl from my class.
night of the prom, me and my boyfriend, P. J. were in a car with Reed and this girl Missy, all blitzed out of our mind.
and we got into an accident...
and Missy was killed.
I wonder why he's trying to buy her silence.
this is all that comes up about the accident.
wasn't even mentioned in the Globe, only local papers.
Rockwell's worried about a background check.
Rockwell -- he knows how to prey on people's dark secrets, cause he has one himself.
I think that Rockwell was driving the car and afterwards, made it look like he wasn't.
Rockwell the one driving?
I swear. I even took a picture...
of everybody from the backseat after we left the party.
but he was never arrested.
no.
I don't understand what happened.
when I took the camera to the police a couple of days later, the negative showed P. J. In the driver's seat.
what? It works.
P. J. went to jail for vehicular manslaughter.
and Reed Rockwell went free.
P. J. would have never been driving that car if he had been drinking. You have to be
he had a wrestling scholarship waiting for him at B. C.
he was talking about proposing.
I've been trying to tell the cops this for the last 14 years.
okay, we got it. Now, here, Rockwell is in the passenger's seat, and he's smiling.
Hardison, is there any way that Rockwell could have doctored the film negative?
we're talking prehistoric technology.
he'd have to switch out the entire roll, put in a new one with the same pictures, except the one he changed.
it's epic but not impossible.
Nate, this girl's got almost nothing.
you didn't take the money, Emma.
I don't want anything from Reed Rockwell.
he sends a guy here with 25k...
...trying to get me to stay quiet about the accident.
I told him to get lost.
look, thanks for...talking to us.
Yeah.
you guys know Rockwell?
is he famous or something?
we're gonna make sure of it.
okay, I want you two to go get the doctored film negative from the police evidence archive.
do whatever you have to do. Just get it.
Oh, man.
can you find the ark of the covenant back there?
how am I supposed to find anything?
I don't know.
afternoon, ma'am. How you doing?
I'm writing a piece for the Police Gazette, right?
on the unsung heroes of the justice system.
the civilians like yourself who keep the archives from...catching fire.
will you be needing any photographs for your piece, mister...
Par...dison -- "Pardison" is my name.
that's Pardison -- it's Swahili. Um...
I've noticed that you have a very unconventional filing system for your archive.
so, where would one such as myself find, like, a-a prosecutor from the late '90s, like a...
90s ... - ...Tom Randall?
Oh, him!
I keep him right back there.
back -- back -- him
he's in the southeast corner?
in...
what was that, Mr. Pardison?
I didn't sa-- I said -- I said what you said.
him -- he's in the southeast corner?
Oh, dear.
ha! It's dusty. Caught the back of my throat, right up in there, right up in there.
you know what?
I-I think I'm gonna actually go ahead and get some pictures, to -- Yeah.
so, all right. You take care.
a-all right. - All right.
all right. - All right. Bye-bye.
we can still make this work.
I don't know why I'm sitting here listening to a new plan.
well, the first one's not going all that well.
this playing-with-fame thing -- it's reckless.
you're not controlling the mark.
all right, we're operating without a net.
somebody's gonna get hurt.
Eliot, why don't you just take the rest of the job off?
consciously or not, I think you look at Reed Rockwell and see everything you hate about Nathan
any way I can get you to not finish that thought?
every time something goes wrong, you push harder, and now you're pushing to ruin Rockwell so hard, you're going to end up ruining yourself.
maybe that's what you're trying to do.
I think he developed and then took a new shot of every picture on the roll.
the one he alters right here in the middle, man
I mean, the tech at the time was primitive at best, but it's really a seamless job.
just skip to the last page, please.
we're not gonna be able to nail Rockwell for the car accident.
what do you mean it didn't work?
how the hell did you screw this up?!!
there was somebody with her.
somebody?
he -- he beat me up with the screen door.
What?!
is that girl's life really only worth $25, 000, Reed?
how's about 14 years of prison for my man?
that part of the payoff?
see, after your friend left,
I started looking through some things from back then, and I found a picture you may have missed.
pretty sure it's worth more than 25k.
tell me what figure you had in mind.
how's about 250?
or what?
or you go to the local news.
or I talk to the first reporter who will take my call.
do you have any idea who you're screwing with?
I'll be in an old Buick.
you wait for me under the bridge.
you got one hour.
and it better be you personally, Reed.
climb into the back of the car, hand over the money
I hand you the evidence, you get out of the car.
simple as that.
very good. - You did great.
he's all yours, Nate.
looks like I missed something.
calm down, Rockwell. Use your words.
if there's a problem, we'll fix it.
I'm being blackmailed!
this bitch I knew half a lifetime ago
14 years -- she just...
I-I was in a car accident in high school.
this girl I know got killed. We were all drunk.
I was not the one driving. I swear to God.
but the cops came.
I was still on the scene.
and now -- now
this girl who was in the car with us wants 250 grand...
...or she's gonna go public and say that I was the one at the wheel.
that's really something.
look. Look, I-I already tried to make this go away.
not hard enough. Sit down.
we are at the goal line here, Rockwell.
now, you can't afford to have a scandal like this.
we both know that it doesn't matter if it's trumped up or real.
look. This request...
for the $250, 000...
maybe it's not such a bad thing. - What?
W-what are you talking about?
comparatively, it is a lot of money, but it means that the girl doesn't want to string this out over a bunch of payments.
she wants to take the money now and disappear.
okay? You both win.
no, Gillis...
she wins.
I'm out $250, 000!
I wouldn't worry about that.
I mean, look, you'll make that money back in a month of speaking engagements, you know, one week of book signings.
don't worry about that. The thing is this -- you are now...
you're not in the shadows anymore, Rockwell.
okay?
you are -- you are at the whim of the media.
and we both know what they'll do with a story like this.
no way I'm letting that bitch get away with this.
she gives me her evidence,
I get out of her car...
...you make sure this is over.
take the land rover. - You got it.
long time, Emma.
just hand over the photo.
Hey. Hey! What are you doing?
what the... Where the hell are we going?!
to get the evidence. I wasn't stupid enough to bring it with me!
just pull the damn car over!
this is amateur crap.
wait. Wait, I know you from the
I've seen you before. I
what the hell is going on here?!
Oh, my God.
Oh, not again.
not again. Not again.
where the hell are you, Kreese?
I'm back at the office. Give me a call the second you...
evening, Mr. Rockwell.
why are you trying to deny this, Mr. Rockwell?
because I didn't cause any accident.
I was the victim. I just got finished telling you.
what, did you pull that badge out of a cereal box?
give me the keys.
any interest in changing your statement there, Froot Loops?
what is this? - Oh, those are your phone records, Rockwell.
which show dozens of calls and texts to the number of that girl who was in that car you just smacked up.
call me now -- so I have your phone...
Oh. Got it.
I'm cloning Rockwell's cell right now.
cute little blond girl like that
what, were you stalking her?
see, what we're getting at here is called intent.
I was -- I was not stalking that girl.
I-I hardly knew her. The only reason I was in her car is 'cause she was trying to blackmail me. I swear to God!
blackmailing you? - Yes.
for this drunk-driving accident 14 years ago.
no, I wasn't at fault!
for which accident?! - Neither!
you guys have -- my briefcase.
get my briefcase. There's 250 grand in there.
it's the payoff money.
it'll prove that she was trying to extort
would that be this briefcase?
wait. How...
sleep tight, my man.
I-I...
no. No, no, no.
this evidence has been digitally altered!
this is not the real photograph. I-I...
tell me about it.
state's Attorney Kelley personally oversaw the Lowell native's release after spending the last 14 years behind bars for a crime he didn't commit.
think they're happy now
wait till they see what's in that briefcase waiting at home for them.
enough to fix their screen door.
couple hundred thousand of them.
...Yet sadness over the death of an innocent girl - in the car accident... - All right.
it was reckless.
it was worth it.
Yeah, this time.
bet you're starting to like that C. G.I. Yoda a little bit now?
Yeah, when he gives back the childhood he stole from me.
why don't you just ask me to join the dark side? Go ahead.
well, Nate, winning isn't everything.
you know, for a while there, you were an honest man.
and then for a while, you were a thief.
Yeah, maybe I'm both.
you can't be both.
I'm just not sure at this point which one I want to win.
now to return to one of the top stories tonight, of Reed Rockwell, whose foiling of a coffee-house robbery on Tuesday was overshadowed by his arrest and subsequent confession.
new evidence suggests that Rockwell was the driver who caused the accident...
...that resulted in P. J. Tiernan's incarceration - 14 years ago. - Yeah.
Mr. Ford, that was a hell of a piece of work.
the gentleman that was listening in on my apartment, I presume.
wiretaps without warrants are a felony.
listen, here's the thing.
we had some outstanding contracts with Mr. Rockwell.
I don't suppose you'd consider taking them on for a substantial fee.
I don't work that way.
you honestly don't, do you?
you actually think you're one of the good guys.
you care to talk this over face-to-face?
congratulations again.
getting rid of scum like Rockwell
you made the world a better place.
and information from the original accident scene states that Rockwell was under the influence of alcohol at the time.
and in a bizarre twist,
Rockwell was caught on a local traffic camera tonight causing yet another car accident.
if they ask you why, you tell them our firm is better than those corporate elephants.
if they want a guarantee, you give them a guarantee.
if they say it's their last dollar, you tell them they can't afford not to do it.
what are you doing?
watch.
learn.
clear.
my father always told me, if they're not smart enough to hold onto their money, then they don't deserve it.
I really wish Taggert could be here to finally nail this guy.
how long's he out? - Not sure.
Mrs. Emmers... Sheila.
they say the swelling should go down in a couple weeks.
who knew ferrets were so aggressive? - Ferrets?
I commend you for your hesitation.
that's why I'm giving you my personal guarantee that you will triple your money in six months.
the school put their trust in you.
don't let them down.
don't let those kids down.
you won't regret it.
she gave me everything!
that is how you do it, gentlemen!
that is how you do it!
go, go! - FBI! Nobody move!
clear!
there's nobody here!
???
the rich and powerful take what they want.
we steal it back for you.
I called the police, but they told me that it was a life lesson, that I should have gone to a legitimate broker.
I mean, I didn't know the difference. - All right. Well, the thing is, by the time the victims realize what's happened, it's way too late.
now I think con men or grifters...
whatever they're called... are the worst people in the world.
I wouldn't necessarily say that this guy was a grifter.
I mean, it sounds like he's more like a common criminal.
well, what's the difference?
a con, or a grift, when it's performed properly, it combines elegance and style with a...
with a classical imitation of legitimate enterprise, parody...
what she's trying to say is that it's not your fault. - No, but it is.
most special-needs schools are private and charge huge tuitions.
our school runs on grants and donations.
we started the investment fund as a way to get out of the red.
bake sales just aren't cutting it these days.
without any money, our doors will close in three months.
and those kids are gonna have nowhere to go.
Where's- whe- are we waiting on Parker?
Oh, man. She's at that damn chocolate festival.
it's like sending a crack addict to a cocaine convention.
girl texted me about an hour ago, misspelled every damn word.
look. ???
probably got chocolate all over the buttons.
all right. Let's get started.
well, you picked a good one for us this time,
Nate. Real good one. This Greg Sherman... he's not just any old con man.
he is a direct descendant of the Yellow Kid.
who's the Yellow Kid?
quite possibly the greatest grifter of all time.
between 1900 and 1940, he swindled people out of more than $10 million.
which is like a gazillion in today's market. Look.
some of my people know Sherman.
they say the boy works without scruples and without conscience.
his new scam is something called the inverted pyramid.
inverted pyramid is where you call 20 people and tell 10 the stock's going up, tell the other 10 it's going down.
whichever one you get right, you call those 10 people back and do it all over again, and you've just convinced five people you can predict the market.
Yeah, except he's not calling 10 people.
in every city, he sets up a boiler room and hires a bunch of hot shots, and they're calling a thousand people at a time.
Nate, this guy probably knows every con in the book.
how are we gonna nail him? - I'm thinking the Peruvian Slide.
no, you need two old people and a banana peel for that.
Unh-unh. That's the Boca Backlash. - Boca Backlash is a roper with a glass eye.
that's the Oklahoma Little Chucky, and it's not a glass eye, - it's a cue ball. - The Oklahoma Little Chucky - is a Rottweiler with some fireworks - No.
no, guys. No, no. Here's the thing. Here's the problem, though.
you know, of course you can't con a con artist.
we're just gonna have to steal from him.
how many of you have degrees in business or finance?
get out of here.
I mean it. Get out!
I don't want any finance guys. I don't want any business chumps.
what I want are the nastiest, hungriest, willing-to-tear-the-flesh off-a-baby-seal, carnivores.
how many of you think that applies to you?
Oh, you do?
cause this ain't the kiddie pool.
you're swimming with the sharks, and I'm a freaking Mako.
that's what they call me, because I'm always moving.
if I stop moving, I die.
I'm at the top of the food chain, and every mark is a meal.
you read me?
so, what if it's your grandma on the line, huh?
what are you gonna do?
get her to buy.
what if it's my grandma?
I...
get out of here! Go on! Get out!
he reads people very well.
he's thinning the herd, searching for signs of weakness.
you need to show some so he notices you.
blink, then scratch your nose.
what about you, Mr. uh...?
steve Beeshore, from the Bronx. What's good?
what would you do with my Nana?
I'll take her for every cent she got, and I'll come back next week and take her walker, her depends, her bengay, moth balls... all that.
don't look away, but keep your eyes soft.
you need to project strength but without challenging him.
grab a desk, Steve.
Yeah. No, no. Look, look, look.
I told you it would go up. It went up.
I told you silver was gonna go down.
look what happened, right?
I give you my word as a member of the S. E.C. the B. B.B. and the J. L.A.
that we got a foolproof way of predicting the market.
no, you can't afford not to do this.
a'ight?
all right.
real smart man, Mr. Calupny.
I'm about to make you a real rich man.
???
what else did I miss in the briefing?
nothing. Nothing at all. I told you.
Oh, would you please just stop that hammering?
why'd Eliot go home?
because he doesn't need to be here, just like you don't need to be here.
I don't mind.
I'm still energized from Le Festival Du Chocolat!
Oh, my God! Sophie, you should've been there.
Sophie. Sophie. Sophie! - What?! What?! What?!
I tasted like 12 different kinds of chocolates.
they had a white chocolate mocha espresso.
I could not stop drinking it! So good!
okay. Did you find it?
no. It's probably offshore.
Isle of Man or one of those new joints, like Timor.
look, man, once he starts moving the money, I can find it, but right now it's like looking for a needle in the Grand Canyon.
Hi, Hardison!
Uh...Hello?
Nate won't tell me what the name of the job is.
Parker, not now. Please? - Yeah, but what are we stealing?
is it "let's go steal a mountain "
or a potato or a funeral or a panda or...?
I told you all not to let her go to that festival unsupervised.
well.
uh, what's... what's happening, Greg?
I'm just burning the night oil. You know what I mean?
I figured you'd be the one I'd find working later than anyone else.
Yeah, yeah, man. It's all in a day's.
I'd expect nothing less from Alec Hardison, hacker extraordinaire, when he's trying to pull a cyber heist.
I figured you'd be the one
I'd find working later than anyone else.
Yeah, yeah, man. It's all in a day's.
hacker extraordinaire, when he's trying to pull a cyber heist.
okay, okay. Just... just stay cool.
tell him you're not stealing, first of all.
look, I'm not stealing.
you're kind of strong, ain't you?
who is it you think you're bumping?
I'm Greg Sherman, the Mako.
my father was the Springfield Wonder.
my grandfather was the Yellow Kid.
titanic Thompson, Wildfire John... I knew them all.
my family invented most every con that you've ever heard of.
tell him you're parking proxies in his accounts.
I was hired to park proxies inside of your accounts. - What kind?
commodities. - What's the angle?
angle? - Repeating the question to buy time to think of a lie?
I was doing that in the second grade.
I was hired by a commodities mogul. - What commodity?
chocolate!
chocolate.
cocoa futures. That's a very volatile market.
no, it's crazy, is what it is. - What's the play?
I'll tell you the... play.
the play is supply and demand, you know?
if you control or predict supply and demand, you corner the market.
so he's a hedge fund manager?
they're a dime a dozen in the commodities world.
no, but this guy, he's only focused on one commodity... cocoa.
some people even call him "Count Chocula " .
seriously, Hardison? "Count Chocula"?
count Chocula"? That's a stupid moniker.
it is stupid... real stupid but he didn't choose it.
he's not one of those guys who gives himself a dumb nickname, you know?
I want to meet this count.
no. - No. I meet him, or you don't leave this building.
do you read me? - I'm... reading you, yeah.
let me think about it. I can probably set something up for you this...
this weekend. - You're trying to run a stall on the Mako?
look, there is no con, no play, no action that you can pull that I haven't done a thousand times.
tomorrow, 9: 00 A. M. his office.
okay.
okay, we're gonna have to call Eliot, uh, and secure some office somehow.
we're gonna need signage, propage, everything.
Hardison, stay with the keyboard for now.
no shortcuts here.
Mr. Travers, of Travers Global? - Yes.
who are you? - Mr. Travers, I'm agent Loynd - with the Internal Revenue Service. - What?
like "loin" with a "d " .
this is Anna Goodwin, Controller General of the U. K.
Yes. We're here about that spot audit.
you know, the Desmond Amsterdam Fund.
the Desmond Fund was closed nine months ago.
Yes, but, uh, you know, the folks over in the U. K. they have different accounting methods than the good old, you know, American I. R.S.
so, we're here to give an assist to Ms. Goodwin and our friends across the shore.
pond. - ???
it's... it's "across the pond." - "Pond." I always get that wrong.
I own this whole building.
you can't come in here without my authority.
Oh, no, that's right. - Well, uh, there were two documents that you uh, signed off on.
I never received any such thing. - Oh, yes, you did. I'm sorry.
look. That's your signature there. - I think that's you...I think.
but I don't remember signing anything.
the I. R.S. has your back on this one, okay?
you know, why don't you take an early lunch?
and it'll be like three or four hours, and we should be okay. Yeah.
it's gonna be fine. Y-yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
that looks amazing on you.
don't be surprised. You picked it out.
I, um...
I better get undressed.
I think you mean "changed," Nate.
Yeah. - Hey.
hurry up. They just pulled in.
Yeah, why don't you stall them in the lobby for a second?
Oh, sorry. Let me get this out of your way.
you got to go... Sorry.
what are you doing, man?
you want to help? Hey. You want to help, grab a mop.
I could use all the help I can get.
now, because I need arbitrage before the convergence, yeah.
no. I-I don't care about the derivatives.
I'm not speculating.
no, no, no. You just go along until I say otherwise, yeah.
it'll all be good. Yeah. Hol...
I got to go. What are you doing here?
I told you, he wanted to meet you. - And I told you never to come here!
look, man. He caught me red-handed.
okay, look...he said the only way to complete the business transaction was for you two to meet.
well, look, there are dozens of chop shops
I can park my contracts at... I don't need his.
tell me about your scam. - I am not gonna tell you squat.
now, you get him out of here. She's on her way.
you don't mean... - Yes. Yeah.
and if she sees you two, she will spook.
go. - Let's go.
take the back stairs. Hardison, you're fired.
you still owe me 200k. - ???
he's paying you 200 large just to park proxies?
Yeah, it must be worth it to him.
who is she?
that's the Chocolate Whisperer.
okay. Sophie, you're doing great. Sherman's still on your tail.
I want you to head for the chocolate festival.
Parker, everything ready there?
Parker? - I'm working on it.
okay, Nate.
Sophie's good to go for the tasting.
you know what, man? I really think she can win this.
what do you mean? She's gonna have to win this.
it's our only way to sell Sherman.
okay, everybody, we're gonna have to be at our absolute best.
this guy is looking for a tell, any sign that we might be conning him.
look, it's the Chocolate Whisperer!
all right, Sophie, I got all so people should start recognizing you any second.
Hi. Would you mind... - Oh, me?
you look great. - How lovely. Thank you.
me too, please. - Thank you so much.
thank you. - Thank you.
you're very kind.
I'm a big fan. - I'm flattered. Thank you.
can we take your picture?
Thanks!
can I get your autograph?
Yes, of course. - I've never heard of her.
ms. Dubois, we've got you all set up over there.
they're ready for you.
Hi. - Oh.
frame me on the assistant.
thank you.
Thanks. Poppy, you're a dear.
thank you. Oh, one more. There you go.
I just saw your website. I love your work. - Thank you.
thank you.
Parker? Parker, let it go.
we need him to check us out.
no, no. Par... Parker, no.
you can't... no... - Too late, man. It's in her DNA.
put it back, Parker.
hello. Would you care for some?
here we go.
we are thrilled to have two of the greatest chocolate connoisseurs with us today.
our first connoisseur is a three-time tasting champion and the author of the new book "Dark Orgasms: My love Affair With Chocolate " .
please welcome Laverne Webber!
and a last-minute addition today, an elusive genius making her first-ever U. S. appearance and participating in her first-ever competition.
she is the woman that the London Examiner says single-handedly changed the world of chocolate.
the Queen of Cocoa, the one and only Chocolate Whisperer herself,
I got all the origins on these chocolates, but there's no way to tell which ones they're tasting.
that's okay.
this is no different than Belgium in '99. Remember that?
you did great then. You're gonna do great now.
connoisseurs, eat your chocolate.
strong personality but not too aggressive, like a man ruggedly handsome yet refined, wearing a pin-striped suit, who offers to share his umbrella with...
a plus-sized woman in the rain.
this is obviously from Madagascar.
I would say it's 70% pure.
an outstanding bean.
well, Madagascar is correct.
but it is 78%.
78%. - Ooh.
all right. Ms. Dubois.
Trinidad.
well, yes, Trinidad. We expected nothing less.
correct.
she didn't say why. She just guessed.
pulling up all the special characteristics on Trinidad cocoa beans.
no. She's good. She's fine.
ms. Dubois?
most would say Ecuador, due to the hint of Jasmine, but if one looks beyond that, one will sense the slightest layer of cinnamon, which, of course, could only mean...
Trinidad.
what about the bean?
Trinitario? Forastero? - Neither.
this could only be the Criollo bean, unlike that thing you put in your mouth, Laverne, which I could smell from here, was an Arriba, the most overrated bean in the world, the one you called "outstanding.
Oh, and...
just under 85%.
whoa, whoa, and whoa!
let's hear it for the Chocolate Whisperer,
clarissa Dubois!
just from a piece of chocolate?
that's my girl.
she's scary.
Wow. Look at that. Isn't that something?
ms. Dubois, that was very impressive.
well, I didn't mean to make Laverne cry.
my name's Greg Sherman. I'm working with... - ??? We have a meeting.
it's Greg, the Mako.
tell me what they're saying.
it's our honor, Ms. Dubois.
hong Kong and Shanghai, they're ready.
your cafes will be the Starbucks of chocolate.
she's opening chocolate cafes in China?
that's why that idiot Count Chocula is buying cocoa futures.
demand is gonna skyrocket.
that is a nice dress you're wearing.
just the relevant stuff.
88 this year, 120 in the next two years.
we need to talk.
I have nothing to say to you.
I gave you the chance to do this easy.
you passed.
I know about China.
Nate, Eliot's in position.
just say the word, Nate, and I'll come in there and tear their lungs out.
not necessary.
Oh, it's necessary, all right.
your whole plan depends on it.
200 nouveau riche chocolate cafes where a billion Chinese consume less chocolate than 7 million Swiss?
that's like going long on DVDs in 1994.
so now you know why I hired Hardison.
well, that's what you want me to think.
but you can't run a grift on the Mako.
who's the Mako?
I'm the Mako...
and I want to know what the action is, or my man here is gonna go Paso Doble on your skull.
the, uh... the crop report is gonna come out on Friday.
it's gonna say that supply is normal, average.
Yes, but demand is gonna jump.
no, no. The crop report is wrong.
who told you this, your chocolate whisperer?
no, no. She's legit. She has nothing to do with this.
that's funny, cause you're sleeping with her.
I see it. It's in your body language when you're together.
it's in your eyes when you look at her.
you two have a carnal relationship.
see, he... he... he's just trying to rattle Nate.
you did say he reads people better than anyone you know.
you all nasty.
I...
listen to me. It's not her, okay? I have a guy.
a guy in the C. F.T. C?
no. It's... it's a guy who... knows things.
when the crop report comes out, everyone's gonna think it's business as usual.
I continue buying futures.
then, in a month or so, the world finds out supply is in the toilet.
that's when I, with controlling interest in nearly all cocoa futures, announce China.
you're talking 100 million.
how's that?
Yeah. Okay.
why didn't you say anything?
Hey, Nate, she's just saying, man.
look, we'll discuss it later.
okay, right now we've got to worry about Sherman. He's clever.
he's too clever to fall for the big store.
he knows every shill, every player in the country.
we've got nobody we can call.
that's why we're gonna use civilians.
trust me.
we got the guy on the dangle.
he's just about to bite.
we just got to keep him off balance and just keep pushing him and pushing him until he's out of his comfort zone.
how far out you trying to push him?
Nate, how many monitors do we need?
as many as you can.
Wow!
you've actually done some acting.
Oh, yes. I performed "Equus " .
theater in the round.
I love that play. It's one of my...
who did you play, Alan or... or Dr. Dysart?
I was Nugget.
the horse? - Yes.
but I was the front end.
go over to the other side, then unload what's in there.
then that is the thing... yeah?
Mr. Ford.
Yes, Ms...?
Cox, with an "x.
of course.
Yeah, that Sophie woman...
I don't think her crackers are quite toasted.
she wants me to moonwalk with a bear.
no, no. See, we're doing a version of the moonwalking bear.
I. B. inattentional blindness.
basically, what it is, is if a person is so focused on something that, you know, they don't...
they can't see the obvious thing right in front of them, like...
like a moonwalking bear.
but what if the bear eats me?
can we... can we just stop a minute?
in the bush, you stop moving, you die.
like a... like a shark!
that's what they call me, "the Mako " .
are you making fun of me?
no. No.
no, it's my nickname, my moniker.
all the greats had one.
great what?
never mind. Look...
so you work for this Count Chocula.
I don't work for anybody.
Yeah, but he hired you to take me out here and show me the cocoa fields.
it's not about the cocoa fields.
it's about the nature.
nature, yeah. - All right.
not "nature." "The Nature " .
the nature of a man.
the nature of darkness.
see the snake?
you eat a snake heart, you consume its soul.
okay. All right. That's more like it.
Where'd you get all these, Parker?
huh?
you know.
put it back, Parker.
uh, Hardison, what do you got?
nothing yet, Nate.
I might have to change locations to make sure I get it in real time.
well, do what you got to do.
those are the top-producing cocoa fields on the entire continent.
so? They're just mowing down trees.
do you know what the most dangerous thing is to cocoa?
sunlight.
too much sun, and the crops won't yield.
well, there are thousands of acres of cocoa.
the farmers are not gonna cut down all the trees.
those aren't farmers. That's the local government.
they're in the timbers business.
they're cutting down every tree in the square 100-mile radius.
off the record.
that's why he knows the crop report will be wrong.
they don't know.
you two, go long on timber, 100, 000 shares, at least two dozen accounts.
the rest of you, stay on the flood.
every network... financial, social media...
I want it to be like when Noah built his boat!
I cannot wait to make this call.
I'm still not sure.
Sherman's been doing this a lot longer than I have.
no, listen, it's working. He's hooked.
Hardison's been monitoring his accounts.
said he went long on timber.
Hardison found his money?
well, those buys were from the company account, but he's gonna have to go into his personals if he wants to get enough cash to go into the big store.
Oh.
Yeah.
it's the Mako.
the what?
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I want in.
listen, the payout is "boxcar," all right?
if you want a piece of this, it's $10 million in cash.
when do you need it?
well, the crop report comes out in 12 hours, so, uh, you know, I'll need the cash on my trading-room floor if you want to be a part of this.
otherwise, I'm gonna have to, you know, move on without you.
I'm in.
he's in.
okay. We're gonna run it again.
all right. Everybody...
places. Back to one!
this... this is a disaster.
well, maybe we'll get lucky and he won't show up.
Oh, he's gonna show.
okay, people. Once again.
Parker, lovely blonde here, is Greg Sherman.
eliot is his driver.
now, once they've entered, it's too late to begin your moves.
you need to be moving and doing everything that you're doing - before they enter. - Before.
so when we say "action," it has to be happening then.
think of it as a dance, all right?
you two... you're yelling out orders.
you three... you're on the phones.
you... that's when you cross with your file cart.
well, where's the bear?
there is no bear, Mrs. Cox.
no, no. There's no bear. Think of it as a dance.
nugget, the moment you see the screens move into cocoa futures, that's when you cross in front of the mark and say your line!
okay, um, Sophie, what is my motivation for going over there?
your motivation is to get to the other side of the room.
Oh. Gotcha.
okay. And, people, please, do not stare at the mark.
golden... golden rule... Do not stare at the mark.
okay. Now, uh, Parker, Eliot... wait for action.
you hear action, a couple of beats, then you come back in the room.
now listen, everybody.
we're gonna do it again from the top.
we only have a few minutes before we go live.
so, let's make this a good one, okay?
this is for us, okay? Let's do it. Let's do it.
go for us. - All right. Focus.
come on. Lots of activity. Busy, busy. Come on.
buy, buy. Sell, sell.
stay busy. Stay busy.
and action!
buy, buy! Sell, sell!
uh, sorry.
cut! Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!
hold on, hold on!
nugget, what happened?
I'm s-sorry. I tripped.
you tripped?
back to one. - She's staring at me, right here.
you guys, back outside.
did you look at the mark? - Yeah, I know. Back outside. Back to one.
Hardison, you got anything?
um, nothing, man.
I think we lost him, Nate.
no, no, no. This is- this is- this is gonna work.
this is gonna work. Okay.
uh, we're gonna reset everything.
okay, guys, guys, come in.
we got to talk.
now he's here right now. - Okay. He's here!
he's here. We're going live. This is not a rehearsal anymore.
this is it.
this is it. - We got one shot at this, everybody.
we're gonna make it work. Places!
focus. - Focus!
break a leg. - You're gonna be great.
okay, thanks. You're gonna be great.
okay, okay.
ms. Dubois and the Count are expecting you, Mr. Sherlock.
it's "Sherman.
I- I want everything you got, absolutely everything you got.
can you believe this?
we haven't had a day this exciting since we s-shorted soy beans in '99.
welcome, Mr. um- um...?
so when do you announce China?
Oh, next month or the month after.
the count has to acquire more futures, and then when everybody sees that the crop report is wrong and panic sets in, we announce China.
Hey, Marco, yeah, hey. Where's your money, huh?
I mean, I got to log it in before the report gets here.
it's "Mako " .
and everything I have to give you is right here.
okay, beautiful.
you want to count it?
I had trouble keeping a straight face.
Oh! And you..."The Chocolate Whisperer." That is rich.
I was onto you guys the whole time.
which is not to say that you didn't have some nice flourishes.
flying me to Ecuador? Wow!
Oh, hey. There he is. I love this guy.
the thing with the snake oh!
and then you decided to run the big store on me.
a little historical note...
my grandfather invented the big store.
and with such rank amateurs I mean, losers...
I can't count how many tells I saw walking in.
they're wearing trading jackets?
what is this, 1990?
and this guy... this guy forgot his line.
Yeah, okay. So you weren't fooled.
I get it.
but, also, you didn't make any money, did you?
Oh, yes, I did.
your little Starbucks of China action...
that story was so good,
I had my boys flood the market with it.
complete B. S. and I leaked it to the world.
cocoa prices are going to explode.
and then I did what you pretended to do.
I committed over $30 million in cocoa futures.
by the time people realize the China thing is false,
I'll have cleared $100 million and be living in a non-extradition country.
it will be the greatest con of all time.
better than anything Wildfire John or the Yellow Kid ever did.
and you know what?
I have you to thank.
I've watched your every move, every eye twitch, every scratch of your head.
I was so focused on you and your team, you couldn't have conned me with 100 of the best shills.
you forgot the first rule of the confidence game...
can't con a con man.
you're right. And that's why we didn't.
you see, we knew that you would be so aware of even the slightest tell that we couldn't risk a con.
your attention was so focused and intense that you saw every move we made.
Yes, I did.
but you missed the moonwalking bear.
the what?
plan A,
Hardison's cyber heist.
remember that?
you know, when you decided that we were gonna run a con on you?
you forgot about everything else.
it doesn't matter, because I had my men move all my money today.
it's all in cocoa futures.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. About that...
call your office.
hello.
this is the Mako. My money get moved yet?
Yes, sir, every cent.
FBI! Hands over your head!
what's that noise?
that would be the FBI, sir. - Hands where I can see 'em!
Greg Sherman, A. K.A. The... - let's go.
what is it again? - The Blowfish, I think.
A. K.A. "The Blowfish..."
you're being charged with 47 counts of security fraud, conspiracy, and market manipulation.
if y...
Hello?
hung up the phone. Rude.
I hate guys that give themselves their own nickname.
church, brother. Church.
church. Sorry.
Thanks, man.
that's awesome.
I hadn't hit anybody in over two weeks.
Greg Sherman, A. K.A...
what is it again? - Crappie. -Beluga. - Gefilte fish.
you're under arrest. - Come on.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
who are all these people? They're not shills.
Oh, these people- they are your victims.
meet Mr. and Mrs. Wang.
you stole $68, 000 from Mr. Wang's father.
it was all the money he had.
you stole from every single person in this room.
every single one of them is a victim.
no. I don't believe you. This is a con.
how much money did Mr. Sherman steal from you?
are you Special Agent Hagen? - Mm-hmm.
agent McSweeten sends his best.
and he also sends a, uh ,haiku.
that's so nice. Say "hi" back. - I will.
special agent? Are you kidding me?
that's right, genius.
she's an undercover FBI agent.
no, she is not. She's a thief.
they're all thieves and and con men and grifters!
sure, Mr. Limpet.
we're all thieves and grifters and con men.
they are! They just... - Get him out of here.
who do you think you're helping out here?!
they stole more money than I ever have!
what is wrong with you?!
I can't thank you enough.
but...
what is it, Sheila?
well, when I checked the school account, the $72, 000 wasn't there.
there was over a million in it.
I'd say your school's gonna be all right for a while.
thank you.
so, w-who's gonna point out the big pink argyle elephant in the room?
listen, it's not that you're not two consenting adults.
but we need to be able to rely on each other.
and we need to be aware of each other's emotional states.
our emotional states are- are fine.
it's not like we're having a real relationship.
no. It's just s...
friends with bennies.
well, I- I'd say it's, uh... - Yeah.
that's not a bad way of looking at it. - Okay.
looks like you aren't the only two.
that is at the same time beautiful and very disturbing.
guys, to the Big Store.
the Big Store.
Yeah, come in.
you're not gonna believe this, man.
this is the guy that, uh...
that bugged the apartment and phoned me.
Jack Latimer. Farm boy.
scholarship to the University of Chicago.
he started his own business back in '85 by mortgaging his house, and now...
he runs an investment firm with assets totaling eight zeros.
tracked him through his investment in Verd Agra.
Verd - the potato job?
but we found the listening device before that.
he was also involved in Merced Financial, Dubertech,
Ernshell Pharmaceuticals.
Yeah, okay. It's all companies that we burned.
so, basically, this guy had stock in all those companies, and we cost him a lot of money.
he wants revenge.
uh, how much did he lose?
who said he lost money?
you run an investment fund worth half a billion dollars.
Marla out of town?
you run a crew that ruins men like me.
ain't we a pair of high-stakes sons of bitches.
want a drink? I could use a drink.
so, for how long?
three years ago, my fund had money in Pierson Aviation.
I had the C. E.O. Steve Pierson, under surveillance.
just standard background stuff.
then when all this happened with Victor Dubenich screaming his head off about con men, nobody believed a word.
except you had photos of a man handing Pierson a bag full of hard drives.
you never turned us in.
bering Aerospace stole that research.
their stock was valued on a lie.
that lie devalued other companies.
you took them down a peg, but you're...
you're not a villain.
you were a... market correction.
you spent a lot of money chasing that single lead.
that young man, Hardison, he covers your tracks pretty damn well.
but after a while, I had enough to figure out what your pattern was, figured out what your next move would be.
so you bet against our targets.
you made investments against Wakefield, Verd Agra...
to a one, you rained destruction down upon them, allowing me to profit in the wreckage you left behind.
you will get out of my business now.
but you haven't even heard my offer.
I don't want anything from you.
and the ones that got away with it?
the companies that covered it up so well, the people they cheated or killed had no idea what happened to them.
I know secrets, sins it would take you a thousand years to find.
what's the price?
24 hours.
but before you descend from heaven with blood-tipped wings and a flaming sword to wreak havoc on these men, you call...
and give me 24 hours to make my move.
your pride more important than helping people?
join our FRS and have fun! QQ Group No. 37304379
Bye!
bouquet? Bouquet.
beautiful, isn't it?
but let me tell you the truth.
for a lot of people, marriage is like sticking your tongue on a frozen flagpole.
it looks like fun when you see friends doing it, so you say:
Hey, I'll give it a try. Just once.
next thing you know, you're stuck.
full of regret.
praying, "Please get me out of this with my dignity...
...if least not my extremities, intact.
but it doesn't have to be like that, my friends.
it does not have to be like that.
that's where I come in.
good marriages are my business.
meeting the right person in the first place?
well, my friends, that is up to you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll go. - Yeah, you go. Okay.
Hi. I'm Sadie. - Hi. Ben.
from that first, destined meeting to the sweet innocence of the first date.
are you skipping to second base? - What's that? No.
you know why? I'm not a skipper.
maybe we should take care of first base, just to make things right.
the first kiss.
the first time you say "I love you.
I love you. - What?
what? A view. What a view.
first time you say "I love you," and she actually hears you.
I love you.
I'm afraid you're not my type. - I love you too.
you seriously didn't think I was gonna let you see that?
let's skip to the next thing: Moving in together.
the first time she finds something you don't want her to see.
don't worry, I got the heavy ones. - Dear Mr. Brian Boitano.
Oh, God! - Congratulations on your triple Axel.
I wonder how much you practice every week...
...and also how you make your hair stay like that.
Hey, he was a legend. Okay?
I mean, even at age 9 I knew that.
I'm gonna get a less embarrassing box. Okay.
if she doesn't dump your wussy ass after that...
...then comes the big one: The proposal.
Sadie...
...you're a great girl. You are.
and I think it's time that you and I were man and...
lame. That is so lame.
we are so pleased all of you could be here with us today to celebrate our 30 years of marriage.
Cheers.
Cheers.
it is especially gratifying to be surrounded by such good friends...
...and family...
...and of course, our two beautiful daughters...
...Sadie...
...and Lindsey...
...who has moved back home with us...
...to try and make a new start for herself.
we are...
...so thrilled with her perseverance.
thank you for the support, Dad.
and then there's Carlisle, Sadie's best friend, who used to take baths with Sadie...
what? - What?
...when they were younger, and pretend he was a submarine captain.
I destroyed all the photos. I promise you.
thank you. Very good to know. Thanks. - Wait, what?
and our good friends, Don and Gwen...
...Kwan-Li...
...Jerry, Otis.
dad...
...what about...
what about Ben? - Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, and of course, there's Sadie's affable boyfriend, Ben.
but what I really want to do is thank my beautiful wife......
...without whom this life would mean nothing.
happy 30th anniversary.
I love you. - I love you too.
and I hope there are 30 more.
well, that makes one of us.
excuse me. Could I have everyone's attention, please?
I just wanted to...
well, I thought since everyone was gathered...
...gathered already...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Sadie... - Oh, my God, oh, my God.
...Wilhelmina Jones.
in front of God and your family...
...Kwan-Li, and Jerry and Otis and...
I just want to know...
...if you would spend the rest of your life with me.
but I don't...
I don't want to put you on the spot or anything.
benjamin Murphy, I would marry you tomorrow in a potato-sack dress in the middle of a rainstorm, if it meant I could spend the rest of my life with you.
wait a second.
you choose our 30th wedding anniversary to propose to my daughter?
well...
...we couldn't be happier.
Oh, my gosh.
I know.
new brother-in-law-to-be, I guess.
Oh, man. Hey, hello. - Awkward.
welcome. - Thank you.
welcome to the family, Ben. - Sir. All right!
Oh, my baby. - Oh, honey, I'm so happy for you.
look at this beautiful ring.
Sadie, Sadie, I was thinking...
I think we should have the wedding somewhere tropical. I was thinking, like...
...the Caribbean.
I have this one thing.
okay.
I always wanted to get married here.
here. What do you mean?
at Saint Augustine's.
it's this fantasy I've had since I was a little girl.
it's the church where John and I married.
where Sadie was christened by Reverend Frank, who's known us forever.
more importantly, it's the church Sadie's grandfather built.
her dead grandfather.
Oh, give me a break. All he built was a door after it was stolen.
how would you know? You weren't married there.
and we all know how that marriage turned out.
mom!
stop. - Here, here, here, here.
babe, you've made me so unbelievably happy today.
you have no idea.
great. - Yeah.
thank you, I love you.
you ready? - I'm missing a shoe.
well, where did you last see it? - I don't know.
you know, Ben, your sweater's actually inside out?
gotta fix that.
what would you do without me?
you want the short list or the long list?
Oh, and your belt?
it's a little funny. - No, my belt's fine.
wait a minute.
we're gonna be really late. - No, we're not.
Yeah, we are.
and your point is?
how do I look?
you look like you've just been... - All right, never mind.
we're so going to hell, you know that?
Hey, here's the door Grandpa built. - Wow, he does really good work.
don't touch that!
Jesus! You scared me.
Jesus didn't scare you, I did.
Hi, I'm Sadie... - Sadie Jones. Yes, I know.
you have a 10: 30 with Reverend Frank.
Yeah. Is he here?
Reverend Frank is everywhere.
follow me.
dear ELLE magazine:
half of me wants to kill him, the other half wants to salvage my marriage.
what can I do?
okay.
what kind of sins are we dealing with here, guys?
Sarah. - Thou shall not commit adultery?
adultery. Going out for milk when you have jugs at home.
show me adultery!
not neat to cheat! Okay!
now, a lot of people ask me:
what if I'm cheating with a woman who's really, really ugly?
does that make it all right?
no, it does not make it all right. It is still a sin.
what other sins? Anybody?
don't hesitate to draw on your parents' bad examples.
Laurie. Bring it, girl. - Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife.
starts with coveting, ends with the clap.
okay, coveting thy neighbor's wife.
that's why God invented the cold shower. Show me coveting!
good one, Laurie!
okay, there's one answer left on the board. Let's see.
Manny.
make your two moms proud.
come on, Manny, you can murder this one.
while I'm waiting, maybe I'll just fashion a shiv out of Cindy's barrette.
take a stab at it.
thou shall not kill?
boom, Manny! Bang, bang, bang!
show me thou shall not kill!
Oh, good one, Manny! Manny, Manny, Manny.
that's it for today.
next we're gonna take a trip to Arlington Park.
we're gonna find out about the evils of gambling firsthand.
so bring at least a dollar...
...and remember to ask Mom and Dad what a trifecta is.
I don't know if you remember me, Reverend Frank, but...
Sadie Jones?
little Sadie Jones.
how you've grown. - Well, yeah.
and now my Sadie Jones is gonna tie the knot.
I am.
I'm sorry I haven't been around for the last...
ten years.
Yeah.
I've just been trying to get my business...
Oh, please.
you go to college, you have a bisexual roommate...
...you forget about God. Don't sweat it.
he doesn't forget about you.
who are you?
I'm Ben.
Ben. - Hi.
so, what do you do, besides little Sadie here?
how are you?
all right, let's get the flock out of here. Come on.
so, how long you two been an item?
about... - Like...
Yeah!
it's been teetering there for weeks.
cheesy Curl? - No, thank you.
too bad, they're addicting.
booked. - Booked. Booked.
nothing there or there.
I am popular.
Yes, you are.
all full. Not looking good. No.
no, no, no.
Nope, nope, nope. - Booked, booked, booked.
bad news, guys.
next available date is in two years. - Two years?
that's...
...so long. - Yeah.
wait.
hold on, hold on. - Wasn't there a cancellation?
I think it's... - There, there!
Yes, there it is.
three weeks from tomorrow, how is that?
that's a little quick. Right? I mean...
okay, I guess we're getting married in three weeks.
okay.
just like that? - Yeah.
so it is written, so it shall be done. - So it shall be done.
Oh, boy.
all right.
one small thing.
couple years ago I instituted a marriage preparation course here.
the course is a prerequisite for all marriage ceremonies performed on these grounds.
at the end of the course, if I feel you're unprepared...
...or you stop the course before completion, I have the right to call off the wedding.
I'm sorry, but this isn't mandatory, right? Because we're so ready to get married.
more than most. - We strongly advise it.
in other words, you have no choice.
with the divorce rate what it is...
50 percent.
much higher for those who live together first.
you did say you lived together, right?
I'm sorry, who are you again?
I'm part of the Ministers of Tomorrow program.
Reverend Frank's my mentor.
my little Mensa.
I can see. - Listen, kids.
we wanna make sure you are making the right decision...
...because your future happiness depends on it.
Reverend Frank has a hundred percent success for those that make it through the course.
but what about the people who...? - Okay, we'll do it.
we're gonna do it. - We're doing that?
it's awesome. - We're doing this.
that's my Sadie.
all right, we have three months of prep to cram into three weeks.
there's only a few rules.
rule number one: You each have to write your own vows.
you have a booklet, and you share these vows...
...with each other at the ceremony.
that's really cool. - Isn't it?
okay. What's rule number two?
starting immediately, no sex until the honeymoon.
I...
are you serious?
Oh, yeah.
tomorrow morning, bright and early.
be there.
we all remember the 11 th Commandment.
I don't.
thou shall not be late.
we've got a hundred things to start, but it's doable.
I just have to get Carlisle on the phone.
he was kidding about the no-sex thing? - Carlisle? It's me. Get ready for this.
we will talk about the no-sex thing later. - Okay, Ben.
no sex?
that's supposed to happen after you get married.
Joel, I come here for your compassion. - I'm just giving you shit.
Congratulations. You are going to love marriage.
damn it, Joel. What is wrong with you?
you were supposed to be watching them.
Shelly, baby, I'm on the roof.
remember we said you won't bother me when I'm on the roof?
you're always on the roof. - Exactly.
I heard that. - Yeah.
where did this mud hole even come from?
Oh, my God, I am so getting my tubes tied.
this reverend says he wants me to meet him after church tomorrow one-on-one.
what is that?
you ever done that? The marriage prep stuff?
to tell you the truth, I don't remember anything before D-day, man.
it's like a black hole.
all I know is that's my wife...
...apparently those are my kids...
...and this, this is my beer.
everything else is pretty much a blur.
Yeah.
thank you.
that's why you're my best man.
two words for your bachelor party:
strippers and Sizzler.
I like to call it "beef and booty.
I heard that.
Oh, boy.
please, God, let somebody be later than us.
Hey. We'll just sneak in the back, no one will notice.
we also ask that you watch over the Mansbridge meat packers and their labor dispute.
grant our packers patience as they await an amicable resolution with, Lord willing, a four to six percent pay increase...
...and dental would be nice.
look who decided to show.
choir! Let me hear it!
you're late, you're late You're late, you're late
God's on time
but you are very late
it's your first offense. We'll let it slide.
it happens again, I'm telling the Big Guy.
and I'm not talking about Larry Carmichael over there on drums.
but seriously...
...Let us re-pray.
sorry for bailing, Lord. A brief interruption, but we're back.
we'd also like to pray for Walter...
...recently returned from his holiday in Thailand.
let's hope it's just a heat rash.
Vivian. - I don't know how you do it, Frank.
every week your sermons get better and better.
it comes from upstairs, Vivian. I'm just the TiVo.
it wasn't that good.
you ready? - Yeah.
I have to go. I have stuff to do...
...but you guys enjoy your man-talk, okay?
don't say anything about me behind my back.
you'll never know so...
tight.
sorry? - The car.
Hi. - Bye.
you ready? A little one-on-one?
Yeah. - Come on. Let's go.
the name of our team is the Crusaders.
I didn't want to tell the kids about the Children's Crusades, it bums them out.
wow, you really meant one-on-one.
Oh, yeah.
a little hoops? - No.
this ball needs Viagra.
play catch? - Sure, love catch.
it's my favorite sport.
pardon the glove. We've had a few budget cutbacks.
Oh, that's all right. - Back up.
okay.
what are you, a little girl's softball league? Back up.
okay. Not a little girl.
Yeah. - All right.
it's nice to be able to chat with you...
...without all this "I'm a pastor who can send you to hell" nonsense.
no, me too. This is great.
little one-on-one time with your spiritual elder.
bless you, Benjamin.
too hard? - No. That's a...
that's a good burn. Right?
anything that's painful makes you stronger.
not really. You break your leg, your leg doesn't get stronger.
God is just, but God is kind.
that's a nice sentiment.
thank you. Can I ask you something?
sure. - Sadie.
why do you love her?
there's just so many reasons, you know?
she's beautiful, inside and out.
so, I'm lucky.
what do you mean by "inside"?
you meant spiritually, right?
Yep. Exactly.
okay. What else?
she's just smart, you know? She's motivated, she's well-organized.
she's probably the hardest worker I know.
well, let me get this straight, then. Correct me if I'm wrong.
first thing you like about her is her looks. But you really think...
...She's a cute control freak. - I didn't say that.
I know what you're getting at. - "Organized" is code for OCD.
OCD is a...
God!
Oh, my Lord.
you okay, big fella? - Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
how you doing... - Totally fine.
let's see that. Come on. Oh, no. That's bad.
I'm gonna have to heal you.
no, that's okay. - No. I'm gonna have to heal you.
I just need Advil. - It's healing time. Stay down.
stay down. It's healing time.
what's that mean? - Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, Lord, surround him with your light and grace.
lord have mercy!
the power of Christ compels you! - Lord have mercy.
the power of Christ compels you!
we have got to pray! - Pray!
we have got to pray! - Pray!
we have got to pray to make it through the day!
is that MC Hammer?
you're healed, right? - Let me see. Let me see.
no, it's still bleeding. - Let's go old school.
begone, demon spirit!
Begone!
that's not helping at all. - Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Lord, take him up upon your wing...
wait, take me where? - Lf you believed, you'd be healed.
do you believe? - Believe!
believe! - I'm healed, I'm healed, I'm healed.
Oh, it's a miracle! It's a miracle! - It is. It is.
you're not healed. I'm not a doctor, I'm a pastor.
you know what you need? Advil and ice. Come on.
check him out, just see that he's okay. - The nasal septum and concha are clear.
good news, kid. Your nose is fine. - Yeah, come on. Let me buy you a Coke.
sorry about that. You know, I have to try that stuff.
never works, but what if it had? - Yeah.
wouldn't that be crazy? - Crazy.
it was great.
Yes, totally. Reverend Frank is the best.
listen, tomorrow night, I was th...
group counseling for what?
okay, like we do every week.
Danny, pick up Tenika and carry her across that threshold.
Yeah, that's it!
try and think of it like the first time.
for a lot of you, that wasn't the honeymoon.
Yeah, baby. Come on, Jim.
my back is giving out.
don't focus on the pain.
look at the love that Janine's giving you right now.
and if that doesn't work, think about potato skins.
God, I love potato skins.
a husband will do anything for appetizers.
Yes.
everybody, I want to introduce you to two new members.
this is Ben and Sadie. They're getting married in three weeks.
Ben, why don't you carry Sadie across the threshold?
come on.
come on. Yeah, come on.
Yeah, there you go. Get across that threshold!
hurry.
Oh, great. - Look.
got it.
tonight...
...we learn how to fight fairly.
sorry.
what if we've never had a fight before?
seriously think I'm gonna puke. - Louise, no puking.
they're young. They're allowed to be enthusiastic.
never had a fight, it's about time you had one.
so please, step up to the top of the circle.
come on, get your butts up there!
let's get this perfect relationship on its feet.
put it to the test. Okay.
I want you to imagine.
you're driving in the mountains. It's nighttime.
but there's a torrential downpour.
that thing with the wipers like this:
you're tired. You're lost.
you're getting cranky.
what was that?
you got a flat tire because you just hit a pothole.
instant argument potential.
what do you do? How do you handle it?
I think we'd probably just call AAA.
out of cell phone range. Can't use the cell phone. Can't call AAA.
you gotta handle it the old-fashioned way. You gotta change the tire.
you're pissed at each other. Go.
sorry I didn't see that pothole.
it's okay, honey.
accidents happen, so just be more careful next time.
promise I will. - Cut!
you guys travel medicated? That was like "Prozac Takes a Vacation.
that's not what we're looking for.
Janine, why don't you and Jimbo show them how this argument should play out?
sure.
Hey, jackass!
I told you to take Route 45, but again, you didn't listen!
now it's pissing down outside and we're stuck God only knows where.
Yeah, well, if we hadn't left three hours late...
...because someone was talking to her ball-busting mother on the phone...
...well, then, maybe we wouldn't be in this position!
you are a sad, sad man.
you will not emasculate me anymore.
go to hell! - No, you go to hell, Janine.
go to hell. - Okay. Cut.
everybody, Jim and Janine.
we're gonna try something a little different now.
we're gonna do role reversal.
all right.
Sadie, I want you to be Ben.
Ben, I want you to be Sadie. Come on. Step up there.
come on, get up! Yeah!
Oh, gosh. - Come on.
you're gonna change the tire.
Ben, tire's down here.
you're down in that muck. Here's your lug wrench.
the lugs are right here. But they're tight.
they're rusty, they're old, all right? You can't get them off and you're angry...
...and you're cold, and you really... You wanna tear each other apart.
go.
don't you wish we were in cell-phone range?
then we could just call AAA like we always do.
Yeah, I don't know how we got so lost. - I don't either.
Ben, maybe we wouldn't have gotten lost...
...if you had just followed the TripTik that I prepared three days in advance.
well, I thought that I was following the road signs pretty well.
just going with the flow, as usual.
what was that? What was that last thing?
I'm just going along for the ride.
who was? You. As me.
well, I'm not really sure how anything gets done...
...if people aren't following my very specific instructions, Ben.
but I love it when you're in charge.
that way I don't have to take too much responsibility, Sadie.
Ben, don't you know that that's the only way things get done around here?
that's how things get done around here? Good.
I had no idea.
thank you. - Want me to show you?
he said counter... - I think I have it under control!
dear Jesus!
potato skins down! - Jim, Jim...
come on, everybody!
five-second rule!
Janine!
okay. We'll pick up next week...
...with balancing the joint checking account.
so are you writing your vows later or?
no, I finished earlier.
Hey, what color white should we go with for the napkins?
there's ivory...
...and timid.
ivory.
I don't know, I kind of feel like it might clash with the pistachio in the centerpieces.
all right, well, you know what? I'll just ask Carlisle tomorrow.
Yeah, you know who else you could ask? Reverend Frank.
because he loves giving his opinion.
why do you say it like that?
I don't know. Maybe because...
...he's just a little bit... - Knowledgeable.
Yeah. - "Intrusive." I was gonna go with intrusive.
Ben, he's not intrusive, you know? He's just...
...observing our relationship right now.
like a voyeur. - Reverend Frank is not like a voyeur.
a little bit. - No, he's not.
what was that? What are you doing?
do you want to walk the midget?
course I do, but...
...I don't think we should, because it's against the rules until after the wedding.
are you serious? - Yes.
you're actually following that rule? - Yeah.
because I want to pass the course. Don't you?
Yes, I want to pass the course. - So?
so, I also want to play Pickle Me, Tickle Me with my really hot fiancee.
okay?
come on. - What?
no one else is gonna know.
I'll know, Ben. I will know. So just...
just please...
...let's stick to the program for now. Okay? Thank you.
three weeks never killed anyone.
Really? Has that ever been documented?
good night.
good night, Ben.
okay, I'm a cigar vendor...
what? - Go to bed.
thank you.
what if I'm not tired?
Yes!
all clear.
What'd I miss? - None of your business.
but they're right on schedule. - Their optimism is touching.
they remind me of the Anderson couple we had last month.
Yeah. You know what time it is?
time to turn up the heat.
it's time to build on the foundation we've set up.
remind me never to cross you.
I mean, I'm really glad we're doing the course.
I just wish Ben would take it more seriously, you know?
what about these in my bouquet, Lindsey?
no.
no?
I just want to feel some enthusiasm from him, or is that expecting too much?
Sadie, you have so much to learn about men.
pink.
flowers by Sadie, Sadie speaking.
meet where?
I didn't even want to take this course...
...and now she's following it to, like, the nth degree.
where are the cheerleaders? Shouldn't they be practicing too?
come on, Famaletti! Deny that baseline!
coach Murphy, you were right to put him on B-squad.
get ready, Zach. - Or maybe I'm just overreacting.
I mean, give and take, that's a part of every healthy relationship.
give and what?
give and take. - Man, listen to me.
once a woman senses she has control, she'll tell a thousand of her friends.
then they'll want control too. "I want a little piece of this control stuff.
next thing you know, they'll be running companies and having their own offices.
do not set dangerous precedents for other men.
Hello?
late for what?
welcome to Saint Catherine's Maternity, birthplace to over 4000 babies each year.
that's almost 80 babies a week, and we've never misplaced one.
okay, maybe one.
if you're shy, get your tubes tied now and call it a day.
a woman in labor basically lies around almost naked...
...while dozens of doctors and nurses get a front row view of her wide open...
Virginia! Put some gloves on those hands right now!
we're not delivering pizzas here.
labor could last anywhere from a few hours to a few days.
and that's not even counting the nine months of constipation leading up to it.
of course, there's always drugs...
...so you should figure out how you feel about that beforehand.
l... Oh, God!
and then be ready to toss that decision out the window...
...when the pain really kicks in.
a woman in labor wouldn't even feel that.
good to know.
or that.
this way.
you squeamish, Ben?
little bit, I guess.
you have to figure out if you're gonna be in the delivery room.
Oh, yeah, of course he will be.
Yes.
some men are so traumatized by the experience...
...they can never look at their wives the same again.
sexually, that is.
give me some slow, deep breaths.
how many do you want to have?
four? - Two?
big push. Big push.
I need an epidural!
look at her! She's breathing fine!
what about me?
they say for a man to experience the equivalent pain...
...you'd have to pull your scrotum over your head.
that was incredible.
glad you feel that way.
because now the real fun begins.
welcome to the world of parenting.
they breathe, they blink, they cry. - And they're all yours.
congratulations, you've just had twins.
look at how their little chests move up and down.
Yeah. Their creepy little chests.
and you really want four of these things?
I think it'd be nice to have a big family, don't you?
Yeah. No, no, definitely.
well, I mean...
...four might be kind of a big commitment.
okay, do you want to take that?
no, you can do it. Come on.
just pat him on the back really gently.
okay.
poor little baby.
little creepy robot baby.
Oh, my God!
God. - Hold on.
here you go. - Stop, stop.
hold on, hold on. There you go.
there's some on his shirt too. - Okay.
we can't forget to set the alarm for 8...
...because we're going to Macy's to register for the wedding.
wait, we're not bringing these with us, are we?
come on, can't we just, like, phone in our order or something?
no, we're so jammed this week, tomorrow's the only day we can do it.
look at that. Fell back asleep.
so I did it.
looks like this parenting thing isn't as hard as they say.
see? You're a natural.
Thanks.
night.
Ben? Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
okay, I'm coming.
what? Hi.
how many times do I have to knock, man? How you doing?
good. - Good morning.
Shelly's dad fell off a ladder. - What?
and unfortunately, he's gonna make it. So we have to go...
...and you are on brat patrol for a couple hours.
thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks a million.
Hi.
which one's the biter?
all you have to do is point the gun at the item you want and then pull the trigger.
the computer instantly logs it in our registry database for your guests to consider.
there's no limit to how many items I can choose?
when in doubt, zap it. - Great.
we only have a couple hours so...
Chop-chop. Come on.
okay. All right. Yep.
guys, guys, guys, slow down, slow down.
Hey. All right, that's good.
now we're going faster. Stop, stop. Hello?
all right, guys. All right.
the yelling needs to hold off. All right.
Hey, Ben, what do you like better? The blue or the beige?
the beige or the blue?
I like the blue. Blue's good. - Beige goes better... ...with the placemats.
or beige. Let's just do beige.
I love beige.
beige it is.
do you like this one? - It's great.
all right, let's get this one. - Yeah, let's get a couple.
Oh, I just got this text message from Carlisle.
I got the wrong dinnerware.
do you mean silverware? Can we just go? - No, dinnerware.
no way. That is not simulated. - God, that's bad.
well, why don't you change the diaper...
...and I'll go get the dinnerware?
why don't we think about... - Okay.
okay.
Yeah.
stop! Oh, God!
stop, stop!
should we get the 500-thread count? Ben, can you slow down a little bit?
Oh, I'm trying.
Oh, my God.
sorry. Ben?
give me one, please? - Will you take that?
I'm gonna give you one.
I will help you by getting this one thing... - I'm sorry.
guys, guys, guys, it's okay.
come here. Come on, come on. - Okay.
Ben, don't drop him!
here, take the kids. Come on, come on.
boys, let's go. Come on.
Hi, I'm looking for some Pima cotton or Egyptian cotton sheets.
something that really seems to breathe. I'm sorry.
I can't seem to find them over there and I have...
get off the bed. All right.
get off the bed.
enough. Okay, enough. No, no. Okay. Stop!
no, no, no. Guys, no, no, no.
just stop. Sorry. It's fine. It's just a...
stop.
stop it! Stop, you stupid... Shut up!
just shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up, shut up! Shut it! Shut it!
Hey! What the hell are you doing?! - I'm sorry.
thank God. I've had a long day.
these are fake. Watch. See?
no, no, no, we're on our way.
we just got a little detained at Macy's. Well, Ben did.
it's a long story.
okay. Bye.
well, I'll tell you...
...l'm a lot more prepared for kids now.
like way more.
why are there 56 bras on here?
pour a glass of that for yourself. Have a glass.
all right, I got it. This is it. You, my dear, look amazing.
I can't believe all these cheeses.
I know. I don't even know which to start with.
there are so many. - It's funny. Cheez Whiz or Velveeta.
that's about as complicated as my cheese dilemmas usually get.
I think I prefer the nutty Comte Saint-Antoine, which is this one.
all right, this is it? - From the Basque region...
...and go. Gonna change your life.
Oh, my God. Carlisle. - Oh, my God. Carlisle. Wait a minute.
Ben, Carlisle's totally right. I mean, this nutty cheese is the way to go.
it's so good. You have to try it.
the white one? Good. - You were right. You recommended it too.
Hey, everybody. - Hey!
every time I hear the word "cheese us," I'm in.
praise Gouda.
look at all of you, you're all dressed to the nines.
Oh, Lindsey, you look fabulous.
Oh, thank you. - How's life after the big D?
that bad, huh?
men are a little too hard to train so...
thought I'd stop trying and live vicariously through Ben's training.
here I was thinking I was already housebroken.
maybe not.
cute. - It's refreshing...
...how honest you are. It doesn't happen...
...that easily for a lot of in-laws. - Really?
because I feel like we all get along really well.
you know what, Ben is a wonderful addition to this family.
wow, thank you.
whatever. There's a little awkwardness...
...but nothing more than just new family stuff.
you know a great way around new family awkwardness?
word association. - Excuse me?
it's fun, really. You go around the table...
...and you pick one word that best describes each in-law...
...then they pick one word that describes you.
a give and take, kind of an icebreaker... - I think it sounds so fun. I love games.
that's the spirit, Grandma.
Ben, start with Grandma.
one word to describe Grandma.
that word would be...
...wisdom.
excellent.
grandma. What about Ben?
peculiar for his age.
let's just try and stick with one word.
I'd just say peculiar. - Okay.
we have a winner. Game over. I think.
no, no, come on. What about Lindsey? - I don't wanna do it.
don't think. What's the first word comes to your mind?
go for it.
blond.
are you kidding me? - Golden.
no, gold. No, like you exude gold. Not dumb, though.
I didn't say dumb. - You didn't say dumb. You said blond.
okay. Blond Lindsey.
Oh, my tur... Okay, awesome! Yes, okay, so...
assertive.
if you need someone to take the bull by the horns, Ben's your guy.
that's a good one. Not that good.
I mean, she's laughing a little too hard for it, but good joke.
this is terrific. See how you're breaking the ice?
there's something new happening now. Take a shot at Dad.
there we go. - Sadie's dad is...
he's outgoing.
outgoing, like saying "nice." - That's very fitting.
you're not shedding any light.
come on, you can do better than this. - Yes.
let it rip. - No, no, no.
no, don't push me. I'm not gonna... - He's asking, Ben.
go, come on. - All right.
what about pompous?
I'm a little pompous. - What's the Wizard of Oz thing? Pompous.
no, I was just kidding.
no. No, no, no. It's all right. I asked for it.
I just meant somebody likes to hear the sound of their own voice.
now you're getting interesting.
pompous dad, back at Ben.
here it is. - Okay.
how about vanilla? - Whoa, mom!
called you vanilla.
could be bland, I'm not sure, but it's your call.
back at mom. Come on, Ben. - Okay, "Stepford-y." Stepfordy.
Stepfordy? Is that an adjective?
Yeah, it just describes, you know:
let's just sweep everything under the rug with a pat on the back, a smile...
...and don't forget the glass of champagne to take the edge off.
you're on a roll. Come on.
do we have any problems here? If we did, we'd just...
...throw some money at it because we all know there's nothing money can't buy.
can't buy communication like this.
Hey, Ben, I thought you were really great with my family today.
are you making fun of me?
no. No. Course not.
it sounded like you were.
I'm not making fun of you. The fact that you...
...lost your mind and embarrassed yourself in front of everyone.
no, that's not making fun of anyone.
okay. - What?
time for a punishment. Come here. - No.
what are you doing?
what does it look like I'm doing? - Something that's very against the rules.
mayday.
Hi. Just in the neighborhood...
...thought I'd drop by, make a little house call.
Yeah, of course you were.
am I interrupting anything? - No, no, no. Come on in.
Oh, thanks. Yay. - Come on in.
Hi. - I won't overstay my welcome.
I just wanted to check and see if everything was okay...
...because after the tasting, things were a little tense with the in-laws.
Nope. No tension here.
can I be frank?
of course, I'm Frank.
pardon the pun...
...but at this stage in the course, I usually find out that...
...a lot of couples resort to sex as a quick fix for their problems.
I just wanna make sure you're strong enough to resist the temptation.
Yeah. We are. - Yeah.
does that make you uncomfortable, Ben?
no, I'm not uncomfortable talking about sex, no.
having you in my living room talking about sex...
...that makes me a little uncomfortable. Yeah.
the number one rule of a good sex life...
...is not being so serious.
you know, because...
...if the humor goes, there goes the intimacy...
...and then there goes the marriage, then divorce, yada, yada.
but there is a remedy.
knowing what your partner likes sexually. How do you find out?
well, you ask. That's kind of wonderful.
Hey, one little exercise, then I'm Audi 5000, okay?
Ben.
look at Sadie and complete this sentence:
I like it when...
this is ridiculous. I'm not doing it. - It's not, Ben. Come on, I wanna know.
I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna do it.
I wanna know.
please.
Sadie.
I really like it when...
...Reverend Frank doesn't interrupt us before sex.
I'm glad I got that off my chest.
okay. - That's okay.
you're not comfortable with this, let's show him how to do it.
don't hold back. - I like it when it's out of the ordinary...
...personally.
that's weird, because I always pictured you as a kind of in-the-bedroom person.
no, not really. No. - Hi! Whoa! Out of the ordinary?
we're out of the ordinary.
because I remember having sex on this carpet and I got a rug burn.
Ouch. - Yeah.
one time, though. It was great...
...but it's more the exception than the rule.
I'm talking about, like, real spontaneity. - Like what?
like my parents' bathroom?
Oh, yeah, and everyone's downstairs having dinner.
exactly. Or on the beach. - Under a towel.
at work. - In the office supply room.
or maybe at your grandmother's house while she's in the kitchen making tea.
Yes! I love it when you get creative.
you have no idea. I love it when you take control.
what do you like about that?
okay! That's enough of that!
Ben, come on. This is just an exercise.
we were talking through it. Yes! - No. No.
Sadie. Pushups, that's an exercise.
no. No, I see Ben's point of view here.
maybe we're rushing things a bit.
maybe I should pencil in the date two years from now.
okay. - Sorry to bother you. Good night.
I'll let myself out. I know the way. You have a good night. I'm going out now.
what was that? - Please.
Reverend Frank!
so we back on schedule?
he's a reverend. What did you think was gonna happen?
well, I can't believe you were talking to him like that.
I can't believe the first man to actually ask me what I like in bed was my minister.
son of a...
Hey, get your butt out the way! This ain't no damn pedestrian crossing!
so you're telling me he bugged your apartment?
Yes. And who knows what he heard?
I mean, this guy is sick, and I can't wait to tell Sadie.
she's gonna freak out. - You cannot tell Sadie.
you think she's gonna believe her reverend is bugging your bedroom?
of course she will. I have evidence.
does this bug have his name on it?
no. But...
all right.
we can talk about this later if you need to focus.
I'm good. This is about you. Lady in the wheelchair, please!
listen.
the lines of communication have to be shut down...
...between you and your woman. She trusts the reverend completely now.
she trusts him so much she's calling Shelly...
...and telling her how we need to take a course to help our marriage.
so I'm supposed to take this lying down?
no. Look, let me make this simple, okay?
we have to punch a hole in Frank's holier-than-thou armor.
we have to find his deepest, darkest secret and take him down.
roach coach.
roach coach!
I'm not doing that. I'm not doing it.
thrust, thrust.
all right, I know you're gonna find something you like with this group.
see, this is just what I gravitate towards.
really simple. - And no diamond? I'm fine with that.
split up?
come apart.
excuse me.
Hi. I'm just here to pick up my rings.
last name's Murphy. - Murphy.
okay, there you go. - Oh, great. Thank you.
let's take a look.
Oh, wow.
they're really beauti... - Thank you.
I'm sorry, does that say "Never to fart"?
that's what you wrote on your inscription form.
I'm sorry, I wrote "Never to part."
I don't know who would've written "fart."
that's ridiculous. - We get pretty strange requests here...
...and we just engrave whatever is written, and there you go.
Yep. "Never to part." - "Never to fart."
no, that's a P. - It's an F, sir.
Nope, that's a P. Do you see how that comes around in a P way?
Judith? - Yes?
could you come over here just for a tiny little second?
thank you. Judith...
sure. - What is this letter there?
that is an F. - No, that's a P.
it's a P. It comes around like a P.
well, actually, if you look, there's clearly a gap in the curl.
there's no gap in the curl. Judith? It connects.
that's a P. "Never to part."
mark, could you just come... - I don't know that we need Mark.
...a little quick second here?
and what is that? - Oh, the novelty inscription, yes.
mark, it's not a novelty inscription. It's a romantic inscription.
excuse me. What is this letter?
it's an F. I do teach penmanship. - I took his class. It's wonderful.
it's pretty clearly an F. - Yeah.
excuse me, excuse me.
Hi. I'm really sorry to bother you. Very nice.
could I ask you to help us out with a problem here, just a little problem?
could we show the normal person? Thank you.
what would you call the letter between the fingers that I'm pointing at right there?
what is that? - An F?
I'm sorry, sir? Louder, please? - An F?
F. - Yes.
that's right. - Okay, excuse me. Hi. All right.
I'm getting married in two days.
thank you. I really need that to say "Never to part.
that's very nice. - "Never to part." That's so sweet.
and that's what I wrote.
I need it to say "Never to part," and I need it done immediately.
so how do we do that? How do we get that done?
we could have it tomorrow. In the morning.
great. And that's what we can do.
but there's a $250 rush fee.
so I'm spending $250 on something I asked you to do in the first place?
and we can guarantee that.
this is ridiculous. There's nothing here.
Oh, come on, man.
if that old lady from Murder, She Wrote can do this...
...then we can find something.
are you talking about Angela L... - Just keep looking.
what is that?
Frank Littleton. That's his address.
but who's Maria Gonzales?
Hello? - Joel, it's Ben.
there's no one here by that name.
is there another name you'd maybe like to try?
eagle, it's Sapphire.
copy that, Sapphire. What's your 20?
I'm at John the Baptist's house.
what's he doing? - He's showering.
dude, you're watching him take a shower?
no, I'm outside.
then get your butt inside.
what? Are you nuts? I'm gonna get caught. - Listen, the rehearsal's tomorrow.
you've only got today to blow the lid off.
it's your only chance.
strike first, strike hard. No mercy.
what the hell am I doing?
stop!
Maria Gonzales.
I got you, sucker M. C.
Hi.
wow, look at you...
...priest dog.
Hi.
I'm gonna...
no. No, no!
that's so gross.
Nicodemus!
Nicodemus!
no, no, no, no!
Nicodemus.
leave Mr. Socks alone.
Nicodemus! Bad Nicodemus!
these are my Cheesy Curls. No, don't you run away.
bad. These are mine.
this is good. Things are really good.
and I'm not even concerned with the fact that Ben hasn't written his vows yet.
Really? - No.
he's just drawn this little animated truck going through a hoop of fire.
you know what?
it's actually better.
because he's waiting until the last second...
...when his mind is completely clear and he can just say what he really means.
okay, hold on. - What do we think? What's the verdict?
let's just take a second.
honestly?
looks a little bit like the inside of a down comforter.
what the hell's going on?
but look, no, the rhinest...
it's beautiful, honestly... - No. I'm not talking about the dress.
I'm talking about Ben. An animated truck?
you know, I wrote seven pages on how much I love and adore him...
...and all he can muster up for me is some stupid Tonka truck in a three-ring circus?
that's it? - Okay, you know what?
lay it on me.
Oh, God.
please tell me everything's gonna be fine.
what do you want me to say?
Sadie, my marriage failed.
I watch Titanic by myself, alone, in my room, every night...
...stuffing my face with Honey BBO Fritos.
not the one to give you any tips or advice about your relationship no matter how desperate you are.
sorry.
however, I do recall my ex never wrote any vows at all.
Really?
that's kind of promising.
Yeah.
it was probably because he was too busy...
...sleeping with our dental hygienist, which was great.
Hey, but your hygienist is a guy, right?
Yeah.
you're fine.
is this a piece of work? They don't make them like this any more.
when two people say "I do..."
...they're putting their lives in each other's hands entirely.
anything less than that is doomed to failure.
now, the last test you have to pass...
...before I certify you ready for marriage...
...is the communication test.
which is very important...
...given how poorly we've been doing in that area lately.
Oh, me? Don't worry.
I plan on communicating very well...
okay, Ben, can you please just let him finish talking?
thank you. - Yep.
sorry, reverend. - It's okay.
to demonstrate how important communication is in that area:
what? - Blindfold.
what are you doing? - I'm not doing anything.
you're gonna be Sadie's eyes as she drives us.
you're insane! - Lf you wanna pass this course...
...and get married tomorrow, you have to pass this test.
your call.
Yeah. Yeah. I can do this. - You're actually gonna go through with this?
what, Ben, you don't think I can do this? - Okay. Maybe you don't understand...
...What's going on here.
Ben, there's two sets of controls.
I can take over at any time.
what'll it be, Benjamin?
Yeah.
well, I'm gonna need a little help here, though.
first you need to put it in gear.
check. - And then you're gonna ease out...
...onto the street.
left. Left!
there you are. Right. To the right!
Ben, did you see a clipboard back there?
there it is. Least it's warm.
What...? - It's a communication exercise.
you will be graded. Less than 80 percent...
...consider getting married in Vegas.
you know what? Vegas sounds awesome right now.
maybe you can get an Elvis impersonator to officiate.
Hey, my wife. Yeah.
Ben, you wanna help your future bride? - Yep, yep, yeah. I do, I do.
how about we take a right? Head back to the church.
you might wanna brake. Anytime.
sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I got nervous.
that's very good. Taking responsibility. Excellent, Sadie.
more enthusiasm in the back, Ben.
Oh, my God, I'm having so much fun! Aren't you? I might pee my pants.
sarcasm, wicked stepsister of communication.
point off. - Now take a right. Now.
a right? Now? - Now!
it's a one-way street!
okay, well, then should I pull over?
no, no. Just go straight. They'll go around you.
Oh, my... Jesus. Okay, okay.
in about 20 yards we're gonna turn. - 20 yards means nothing to me. I can't see.
here we go. Turning now!
there's a man. That's an old man in a hat and a thing.
look out!
I'm blind, Ben! - That's enough. We're ending this. Stop!
is that what you do when things get difficult?
you're just gonna quit?
I need to count on you, Ben.
life will hand you stress and the key to managing your anxiety...
...is not letting it contaminate your partner. - Garbage truck!
where? - Punch it!
Yeah!
I'm pretty sure I'm not learning anything from this.
are we good? Are we good? - There's Burt Fleeger!
looking good, Hollywood!
I feel like I'm not getting any guidance. - You might wanna pick up speed a little.
wait, wait. Why would we do that? - There's a parking space up there.
gun it, Sadie.
I never get this space! - Oh, my God!
perfect.
Hello, Jones family. How's it going?
Hello, reverend.
daughter's a good little driver.
well, you have the wedding processional. You can go with Mendelssohn...
...or one couple actually had Captain and Tennille here playing "Muskrat Love."
it's your call. After you boogie down the aisle...
...l'll start by saying something nice.
speaking of that, let's give a big Saint Augustine welcome...
...to Ben Murphy's parents, Ron and Mary Murphy.
came all the way from Seattle.
then I get into a brief message about the joy and the sanctity of marriage...
...and that on your honeymoon, try and act surprised.
it's an old joke, but sometimes works.
then we got prayer, hymn, prayer, hymn.
and then we get into the vows.
in my course, the couple writes their own vows.
and that in mind, may I have your vows?
thank you.
thank you.
Ben? - Yeah.
got the vows?
Ben, where are your vows?
Oh, I have them. I just...
I haven't finished them, but I will have them here tomorrow.
okey-dokey. Well, I guess that'll have to do for now.
after the vows, we have the lighting of the candle.
it's true, by the way. - Not now, Ben. I just wanna think.
thinking's good.
Yes, I wanna think about everything. - What about?
I'm guessing these aren't part of the vows.
okay, because I used to think that we were so perfectly compatible for each other...
...and now...
look at us, Ben. - What?
Ben, you want two kids, and I want four. - So what?
you obviously think my family is a bunch of rich, alcoholic snobs.
you never take the lead on things, Ben! - And I'm not good enough for you!
I'm not adventurous enough in bed, right?
and I'm not as handsome as Carlisle, not as successful.
Carlisle has nothing to do with it.
Carlisle has everything to do with it. - How?
because he is someone whose opinion you trust way more than mine.
Oh, God. When have I ever said that to you, Ben?
you just don't have to.
Carlisle, what crystal should we use?
what brand of cheese is good, Carlisle?
God, I am so sick of you choosing Carlisle's cheese.
Carlisle's cheese. Explore that, Ben. - Enough of the pop psychology, reverend.
because all you've done is everything you can to make sure this doesn't work.
I've worked very hard to create lines of communication between you and Sadie...
...to let you know what you're in for.
you're onto it. - Yeah, we are.
we are discovering a whole shitload right now!
Really? - Yes, we are, Ben.
guys, seriously, space, please. - Now's the time. Pop the info.
okay. Okay. You know what?
I didn't wanna have to do this, but I have no choice.
so aside from the fact that Reverend Frank bugged our apartment...
excuse me, what?
I've mounted an investigation.
one that I think you would be interested to hear about.
so Frankie, should I tell them or should you?
what do you want me to tell them?
what I want you to tell them is what their good and decent...
...and ever-so-intuitive reverend was doing when he married...
...and then subsequently divorced one Maria Gonzales.
that's not true.
Reverend Frank has never been married or divorced.
that's what I thought too, Grandma Jones.
but...
...Reverend Frank?
it's true.
what?
Oh, it's very true.
how can we trust anything he said to us now?
we have put our relationship in the hands of a total hypocrite.
I didn't wanna have to talk about this to protect certain parties...
...but enough time has passed so the truth can finally be known.
Yes. Please do.
several years ago, a young woman named Maria Gonzales attended our church.
she was a refugee who was denied political asylum.
if she was deported back to Guatemala, she would have faced most certain death.
so in order for her and her children to stay in this country...
...I agreed to marry her so she could get a green card.
once she was legal, we divorced.
she moved to New Mexico with her kids.
a couple of years ago I got a letter from her, and she told me...
...that her oldest had been accepted to Harvard Law.
he was going to graduate in the top of his class, and when he did...
...he was going to go into immigration reform.
and that is the story of Maria Gonzales.
I keep their pictures in my wallet...
...to remind me that one person can make a difference...
...even against insurmountable odds.
that's... That's Pablo right there.
Ben.
if you had just spent half the amount of time on your wedding vows...
...as this stupid little investigation...
...we would probably be walking down the aisle tomorrow.
and, no, no...
I can't do it.
unbelievable. - You're such a jerk.
Benjamin.
are you happy now?
it's a painful process.
that's why we do it.
to find the truth, Benjamin.
Sometim...
why did you punch the reverend? What is wrong with you?
nice right hook, but you are going to hell. Know that?
I'm sorry. J. C. I'm sorry.
three weeks. That's a new course record.
man, I haven't seen a right hook like that since the Buffolini meltdown.
I hate this part.
I'll get the bag of frozen peas. Come on.
here we go.
Hi.
I can't believe I was about to marry someone I didn't know.
that's why we have the course.
it's good that I found out now instead of down the road...
...because that just would have been awful.
I'm sorry, he just, he makes me so mad.
what am I supposed to do now?
you still have your honeymoon tickets? - Yeah.
use them.
go away for a couple of days. Take a friend, family, anybody.
I don't know. - Oh, come on, it'll be great for you.
get a tan, huh? Trust me.
see you, kiddo.
you know...
...maybe Ben wasn't the only...
no.
no, no. What? What? - No, have a great trip.
I mean, it wasn't supposed to be like this.
Yeah, I feel as bad as you do.
now she's using her honeymoon ticket without me.
I mean, how is that supposed to make me feel?
bad. I think.
three weeks ago, I was the happiest guy in the world, and now I just...
now I'm just sitting here with you.
Thanks. Thanks, Ben. Appreciate that.
no, you know what I mean, I just...
Hey, it's cool.
look, don't take this the wrong way, because Sadie's cool, I like her a lot...
...but there are plenty of fish in the sea.
and now it's your time to be the king barracuda...
...and get out there and swim with the sweet tuna.
the ocean is yours, man.
that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
okay.
you're a bear.
now jump in that forest...
...and you gotta tag as many cute, furry, bear butts as you can.
Joel...
...you're my best friend, man. You know that?
and I love you. You know that? - I love you too.
but you have got to be the worst advice-giver I know.
I mean, not only is your advice terrible, but...
...it just backfires at every turn.
and now you're talking to me about fish and bears.
she's a woman, Joel. I mean, she's an amazing woman.
and she's just so beautiful.
and she's loving and...
it was all right there...
...and I lost it.
and I don't need you telling me that I should go out and find someone else.
I mean, I don't need anybody telling me how to go...
I don't need anyone telling me.
wait. Where you... Ben! Hey!
no way.
Whoa! Is that one strike or two against Rodriguez?
two.
awesome job with the camouflage, guys.
seriously, you got me.
who'd have thought you'd be in a van with "Saint Augustine's"?
just listening to the ball game!
cubs are off today.
Hey, Gillie.
this guy say he's in love. He come to Jamaica to find his girl.
well, see, we were supposed to get married and then she just called it off.
Oh, no. It's a long story. Just...
man, you don't have to worry, it's a long ride.
it's really a long ride. You can sit and tell us.
well, what happened was...
it is absolutely beautiful here.
Hey, Mom, you gonna get in your bikini?
like hell I will.
talk to her. This is for lovers, man!
thank you.
it's Ben.
what? - Sadie, it's me.
I know. What do you want? - Look, I have to talk to you.
guess what, Ben?
you had your chance. You had an empty book and you didn't say anything.
and that's part of the thing. Listen... - No. Ben...
...I don't wanna talk to you. - You don't understand. I'm in...
Sadie?
how come I could say so much and he couldn't say anything to me?
can someone please explain that?
sorry.
I was just clearing my throat.
John! - What?
a piece of coconut went down the wrong way.
your daughter's in pain.
Yes, I'm in pain. And I'm all alone too. - Not you.
I'm alone. - Not you.
is anyone at all concerned with the fact that my life is falling apart?
Oh, of course we are, sweetie.
but relationships are complicated.
we certainly don't have all the answers. - You guys have been married for 30 years.
you must be doing something right. - Not all those years were great.
years 16 through 18 in our marriage were something straight out of The Shining.
okay, but Ben and I couldn't even decide on what color napkins we wanted...
...Let alone how many kids.
and he couldn't handle that I have a good guy friend.
I don't know if it's our friendship he was insecure about.
Really?
listen, I'm gonna support you here.
but you gotta think about this from Ben's perspective.
how do you think he feels when you're always coming to me?
I don't go to you all the time. - When are you going to him?
just maybe...
...Ben wants to be with somebody who needs him for a change.
that's really heartfelt.
does this happen all the time? - Sadie?
to go from being so in love to this.
you know, I'm all alone on my honeymoon at Sandals...
...couples in love all over the place. This isn't what I pictured.
well, is it ever what you picture?
were we the first ones to fail the course?
who said the course is over? It's only over when you decide it's done.
I don't know what to do.
it'll come to you.
have faith.
thank you, Reverend Frank.
right on schedule.
Hallelujah. Now do you mind? I need my beauty sleep.
no smoking on this flight, but you can light up whatever once we land.
Ben? - Hey.
you picked up.
it's so weird. I was just thinking about you.
you were?
Yeah.
my family said some things to me yesterday about...
...me not relying on you and...
...it got me thinking...
...about that stupid truck...
...you drew in your wedding vow notebook.
and I know this is gonna sound so weird but...
...It's why I love you.
you don't always say the right things or do the right things but somehow...
...I know you would jump through a hoop of fire for me.
Hey, can you do me a favor?
I think you should come to your window.
I left my vow book at home so...
...I figured I should write a few of them here.
what do you think?
I am so sorry. I messed up. - Me too.
there's so much to say. I just didn't know how.
I need to stop doing everything myself and share the reins.
no matter what I do, I know you're gonna support me.
if I'm ever blindfolded, you're the one to guide me.
I want to have as many kids as we possibly can.
Really? After Macy's, I definitely want two.
I need to be more decisive.
about napkins, about... - Napkins, cheese, anything...
...at the end of the day, I'm gonna rely on you.
because nothing means more to me than you.
nothing. I love you.
I love you.
what's going on here?
Reverend Frank? What are you doing here?
Reverend Frank is everywhere, remember?
thought you two broke up.
we did. We just sort of talked it through.
seems like we have more faith in each other than we thought.
Congratulations.
you just passed the course with flying colors.
so how about it?
do you think we should get this wedding started?
I do.
and do you, Benjamin Fitzpatrick Murphy...
...Take Sadie Wilhelmina Jones to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do. - The rings.
never to fart"?
Oh, my God.
I didn't change it. I'm gonna change it when I get back.
I promise I will. - No.
bite your tongue, because I wouldn't want it changed for anything in the whole world.
no.
ready?
by the power vested in me by God...
...and the Minister of National Security and Justice of Ocho Rios, Jamaica...
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
you gotta turn. There it is!
Frank, we just wanted to come and thank you for everything.
I'm just fulfilling my life's calling. - You know what?
we wouldn't have gotten here without you. - Thanks.
you're gonna have a wonderful life. I have no doubts.
excuse me, may I borrow my daughter... Your wife, for a dance?
Yes, please. - Thank you.
Bye. - You look beautiful.
Hey, can I ask you a question?
sure.
when did you know that we were ready to get married?
the moment you told Joel that Sadie wasn't a fish, I knew it was meant to be.
besides, anybody who kicks a reverend's ass for his woman...
...you're A-okay in my book.
well...
you're starting an incredible journey with a wonderful partner.
thank you.
and on the honeymoon, act surprised.
I will.
take care of yourself, B. - You too, Frank.
Oh, my God.
wait. - No, that's what they're supposed to do.
I know. I lost... We broke...
but it's okay if we laugh, right?
it's not okay if we laugh, is it?
you broke! - I did not.
we still got a siren. My ride's here.
I like shooting downtown L. A. because pretty much you got 911 all day.
I'll be over here.
Whoa! "Be chill, don't kill.
that goes for you too, Mr. Simpson. Okay.
I thought you'd work so hard!
just get me a bottle of water and a rubber mallet.
come on. Thrust it, thrust it, thrust it!
people, we can do this. They're not that...
Ben?
help out, everybody. Mother father.
you play cutch?
Cutch.
let me walk back and cutch, which is a old game.
that's scary that I could say it like that...
Oh, my God.
no. Stop.
I'm gonna look like such a rookie, because every time...
cut.
Yeah! - Yeah!
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event Lovematch Connectors
here you go. Have fun and good luck.
Thanks.
woman, giggling: Hi.
I'm Joan.
Hi.
Cal--are you Irish or...
no, I'm English, actually. Oh.
that's so neat.
so, what do you do? - I'm a furrier.
is that-- like, fur coats?
fur coats, wraps, stoles, hats,
mainly fur coats, though.
how about you?
um, I have to meet my friend.
well, maybe we can catch up later.
Hey.
lose a bet?
basically.
my friend over there dragged me along.
if we were in a hotel room
and you could order one thing from room service,
would it be chocolate cake, strawberries, or warm honey?
I beg your pardon?
I got to take this.
Yeah. What's going on?
Hey. Uh, what's your eta? - Oh, I don't know.
you can't hurry love, Foster.
can I get a lager? - I hope that's your first drink.
all right. D. C. police are looking for a guy named Erik Matheson.
he's been on the run for 2 days since his wife was found beaten to death.
so, they want us interviewing friends and family
to help determine if anybody's helping him evade arrest.
and I've already gotten Loker and Torres in the field.
Chardonnay, please. - I don't care...
if he personally inspected it before he shipped it.
the painting's scratched, all right?
what are you talking about? - Tell him--you tell France.
he's paying for the restoration.
otherwise, the whole thing comes back his way.
collector?
dealer.
I'm a curator.
Really? - Really.
I don't know.
I guess the upside to having been through a marriage before
is that I not only know what I'm looking for,
but I know what I don't want. Mmm.
I just want to be happy. - Yeah, I know what you mean.
like for me, right...
this one thing is very, very, very important to me.
it may seem old-fashioned to you, but that's fidelity.
Yeah. for some reason, I feel the need
to be up front about that. - Heh.
that's not old-fashioned. It's important to me, too.
Uh-huh.
you know, the entire time i was married, i never cheated.
I was tempted and certainly accused of it,
but I never strayed...
never. - Hmm.
um, so, what are your hobbies?
what do you like to do on the weekends?
I run a company that shrink-wraps poodles for international travel.
I have to, uh, go feed my meter. - Ok.
um, I'll be right back. could you hold that thought?
Yeah. I'll, uh, save your seat.
Thanks.
Hey. - - Hey.
so, uh, in answer to your question from earlier,
it's warm honey, right? - Heh, heh, heh.
you should call me sometime.
OK.
the place is clear. You want us to stick around?
no, I'm good, thanks. Go ahead and check out the next name on the list.
I'll be right behind you.
Gwen, hi. I'm Ria Torres.
I'm with the Lightman Group. - Yeah, the cop told me.
any idea where your brother might be?
running, apparently.
well, it'll be a lot easier for Eric if he turns himself in.
Yeah, I-- I get that.
his wife Connie was my best friend.
I just can't believe she's dead, but, uh...
I don't know. Ok?
are we done here?
ma'am, why do I get the impression
that there's something you're not telling me?
well, there's a lot I'm not telling you.
like how I can't sleep, how I don't know how I'm gonna tell my kids
that their uncle might have murdered his wife.
I mean, do you want me to go on?
I don't know where Eric is.
do you know something that could help us with this case?
no.
and I want you to leave.
now.
you a cop?
no.
but they were here, right?
they were here, weren't they?
Yeah, yeah, they were here.
God. Look, you don't need to hurt me.
I can help you.
I can help you.
drive.
drive!
don't look at me. Drive.
Foster: hey, how did it go? - Put me out of my misery.
Cal: Hi. right.
sir, your ex never cheated on you. There it is.
you're positive? - Yup.
I spoke to her for half an hour at one of those, uh,
uh, singles--mixers. Singles what?
singles mixers, and not a hint of shame or guilt when the subject came up. Her virtue is intact. So...
let me remind you, there's millions in alimony at stake.
I'm well aware of the terms of your prenup.
I'm telling you, conclusively,
your wife never violated the fidelity clause, or however you put it.
maybe if I increase your fee, you can run another one of your tests.
all right. let me just stop you right there.
the truth's the truth.
send me the bill. - I will.
I definitely will.
boy, that was fun. what's next? Uh,
peeking through keyholes or what?
you leveraged this company to buy your ex-wife out of this, ok?
Yeah, only 'cause she was gonna move my daughter to Chicago.
Yeah, yeah. but now, we are cash poor,
and taking cases like this helps us stay afloat.
I don't care. I don't care. - What?
I'll go back to working out of my kitchen
before I take another case that.
I don't care. I don't care. - All right.
the bills, the books, the payroll, fine. It's all yours.
hell, everything-- everything, it's all yours. You can take it.
will you calm down? - Will I calm down?
what's the matter with you?
I didn't kill my wife.
and you people are gonna prove it.
Hey!
you think I'm playing around?!
absolutely not.
cops start showing up,
I start killing people. do you understand me?
we understand you completely.
you stick with me. - No, no, no.
she--she just--she just makes the tea around here.
let her go. I'm the guy.
uh, see the sign? The Lightman Group.
see that? The Lightman Group?
Cal Lightman--that's me. I'm the guy.
I'm the one you want. Just let her go, all right? I can help you.
hell no. I need to see the front door.
I have surveillance cameras up here, up here, all down the corridors.
my office is on higher ground. You can watch them from my computer.
come on.
all right.
everybody in here! Everybody in this room!
come on! Let's go, let's go.
move!
I'm gonna do a head count in half an hour.
if anybody leaves or calls the cops, he dies.
OK. Ok. No police.
no police. I'm serious!
no police.
it's on you now, buddy. - All right.
understand. Yeah?
OK uh, we're gonna stay calm
you know, get Cal out of this.
I want you to go call Loker and Reynolds and get them down here.
but don't tell them what's going on, ok?
OK, go. Just be careful.
do your thing.
OK, so front and back entrance in the lobby.
Uh-uh. I said no phone calls.
you said no calls to the police. She's not stupid.
you need to start being clear here.
if I see any cops...
you are familiar with what we do, right?
Yeah. She filled me in on the way over.
you know that we're not law enforcement.
Yeah, yeah. You're, uh,
some scientist who knows how to tell who's telling the truth, right?
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
so, I got a question for you.
if you know who killed your wife and it wasn't you,
why aren't you at the nearest police station banging on the door,
demanding they take action?
that's something a guy like you would do.
I've had my run-ins with the cops,
and they've never believed me yet.
and when I walked in that door and I saw my Connie
dead on the floor
OK. You got a knack for telling who's lying?
I got a knack for knowing when I'm screwed.
and in that moment, I knew this would land on me.
fair enough.
but no more shooting, no more threatening those people out there,
or you won't get my help, and we'll both lose. All right?
you more than me.
I already lost everything I cared about.
but you heard what I said, right, Eric?
do you believe me when I say i didn't kill my wife?
Yes.
and you believe I'll kill you If you try to run a game on me?
Yes, I do. - Ok.
am I being clear enough now?
Yeah.
so, Eric,: Tell me. Who killed your wife?
are you out of your mind? - Just for a little while,
until we figure out what's going on.
this is a hostage situation!
well, Lightman's giving us eyes in the room.
how the hell did that guy get in here with a gun?
he has got the situation under control.
do you know what misprison means?
it's failure to report a felony crime.
now, I'm not gonna risk the lives of everybody out there and get fired in the process
because Lightman thinks that he's got a handle on this!
yes?
Cal: Foster, could you come in here for a minute, please?
sure.
we've gotta figure out who killed this guy's wife.
Matheson did. Innocent people do not run!
if we don't do exactly what this guy says,
he will kill Cal.
can you please just help us out, Ben?
all right.
I'll hold off calling it in for a little while...
but only under one condition.
come on, come on, come on.
how's everyone behaving?
perfectly.
good. All right.
OK, that's the address of Tom Mchenry.
he runs an advertising firm.
Eric's wife used to work for him as a bookkeeper.
now, Eric's claiming that-- I know. I know.
now, Eric knows...
that Mchenry was making unwanted moves on his wife.
and he considers him to be the only suspect in her death.
so, I'll need you to track him down and, uh,
interview him...and tape it and bring it back to me.
well, what if he doesn't-- - Just find a way.
OK?
Reynolds is here. - Who's he?
he's a...
federal agent. He works with us.
Ohh. Same rules apply to him as everybody else.
he's, uh, agreed to not call the police,
but only if everyone in the conference room is allowed to leave.
you bring him in here. I'll tell him what's allowed.
it's nonnegotiable.
you bring him in here! - Hey, hey, hey! Eric.
what do you want to do? You want to play king of the castle,
or do you want to find out who killed your wife?
come on. Let's go. Let's go. Everybody out. Let's go.
don't say anything.
don't call anybody. Don't do anything. Just go home and relax.
we got the situation under control. Ok?
come on, Heidi. What are you doing?
let's go. Come on. Follow everybody out.
you really don't want me to call the cops?
no, I don't. But I think we should call
no. Listen. Don't do anything, all right? Not yet.
I want everything on Matheson.
monitor all the hallway surveillance off my computer.
anything happens, call me and Reynolds.
what? No, I'm not going anywhere. I can't leave.
it would help to have a badge to convince this guy to talk to me.
well-- I'll fake it.
OK.
leave your tie. - What?
come on.
Thanks.
um, badge, too?
no. No badge.
I screwed up.
Tom Mchenry. - Yeah?
all right, you two, out. Come on.
get out. Let's go. - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. You gonna tell me what this is all about?
this is my colleague Gillian Foster.
we're here about Eric Matheson.
did you find him yet? - We did.
good. I hope he gets the death penalty.
he's saying you killed Connie.
did you?
I'm not even gonna dignify that with a comment.
well, you're gonna need to, pal.
you know what? This is further evidence that Eric is a first-grade psycho.
all right. Twice now, you've done what we call
a false inference dodge, Mr. Mchenry.
you have yet to answer the question.
no.
this is why he's crazy. This is why I had to let Connie go.
he was convinced I was trying to have an affair with her.
he was convinced that I was filling her mind with what a loser he was,
as if she needed further proof.
well, then you won't mind if we put you on tape.
Heh. No, no. No. No.
why not? I thought you were innocent.
OK, fine.
roll it.
Eric: Who's that?
that's my daughter. You mind if I call her?
Yes, I do.
take a seat.
you married?
not anymore, no.
so, which one you banging?
uptown chick or the salsa queen that drove me here?
neither, actually. - Yeah, right.
that's one thing I got over guys like you.
my woman loved me. We had something real.
guys like you...
empty.
so, you try and fill yourself up with n-nice suits
and stupid art and show-off books
and by nailing your employees in the copy room.
you got a job, Eric?
not currently. What does that have to do with anything?
well, I'm sensing a little inner turmoil
over the fact that your wife was the sole provider.
no. No, we were rock solid.
we didn't care who made the money.
Ah, that's something you'd never understand.
OK.
OK.
don't--don't look at me like that.
like what? like you're better than me.
I told you that I would know if you were telling the truth,
but I also know if you're hiding something from me.
I'm not hiding anything.
you're projecting a... little guilt.
Yeah, that's either from self-loathing or from something else.
I'm just trying to figure out why that's making you do this.
they got half an hour to get that tape here.
Yeah.
Ben: Yes, sir.
uh, no, no, they haven't yet.
everyone from the Lightman Group is out in the field right now
interviewing Matheson's friends and family.
Uh-huh. Yes, sir.
that's--that's really great, sir.
OK. All right. Bye.
I'm screwed.
Oh, good. Foster and Loker are back.
Ria...come on.
you gotta stop this. You did nothing wrong.
I should have locked the car. Why didn't I lock the car?
look, you gotta quit beating yourself up about it, all right?
stay focused. We need your help on this.
all right. All right. All right.
Hey. We just ran Matheson's sheet.
police responded 3 times to their apartment for domestic disturbance.
the wife never filed charges. I'm telling you, this guy's the killer.
well, he seemed believable when he said he was innocent.
"seemed"? That's not good enough.
I'm taking this in to Lightman. Whoa.
wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
set it up in the lab.
tell Lightman that's where he's got to watch it.
Why? - Because I can get a better visual on the guy.
again, I don't want to rattle this guy any more than we have to.
Gillian, what's your priority, huh?
running errands for this lunatic or making sure that Cal lives through the day?
where is it?
it's just across the hall.
Oh! Easy. Easy.
all right. Take it easy. Now, that's Reynolds.
that's the guy I told you about. He works here.
Uh-huh. Open it. - Just calm down, all right?
stay back.
lock it.
lock the doors.
now, where are we watching this? Huh?
if you let go of my neck, I'll show you, all right?
all right. and I-- I want to see the front entrance and the back entrance and the lobby.
pull that up.
there you go.
Eric: Good.
Foster: What's your name? - There he is.
Tom Mchenry. - Smug son of a bitch!
how did you know Connie Matheson?
she worked for me.
did you, uh, ever socialize with her?
Yes.
couple of times after work for drinks
that's it. Strictly platonic.
is he lying yet?
Hey, could you shut up?
Lightman just activated the audio. My man.
all he's got to do is bluff--just tell Matheson that this guy is lying,
and they he'll testify to it. That's all he's gotta do.
Foster: tell me why someone would accuse you of killing Connie Matheson.
no sane person would.
only her husband Eric would do that.
I didn't kill Connie.
he's lying, right?
well, I see no typical signs of deception.
can't be sure, but...
I don't think he killed your wife.
Ohh. He's puttin' one over on you!
look, I'm good enough to know you didn't do it.
all right?
well, neither did he. - No way.
no way!
Ohh. Why didn't he just bluff?
keep rolling the tape.
this guy is too close to Lightman. If I can get some distance between them, I can end this thing with one shot.
go on!
Foster: When's the last time you saw Connie?
3 weeks ago.
she came into my office,
asked for a loan to pay off a debt that was weighing on her.
that was the last straw.
I told her she needed to find employment elsewhere.
he's lying.
no, he's not.
what debt? - I don't know.
I don't know!
look. You break into my office...
you terrorize my staff, you threaten to kill me.
well, congratulations. You got my attention.
so, now, tell me what the hell's going on.
sit down.
let me think.
who did your wife borrow the money from?
no one.
that's a lie.
no one!
I did.
huh.
chump change--10 grand.
who did you borrow it from? - A buddy
who wouldn't do anything to Connie.
how much have you paid back?
that's the guy!
and you're playing games with me?
how much have you paid back? none.
it's--it's a fresh loan. Th-there's plenty of time.
you know, I think I got you wrong.
I think your wife approached you. She confronted you with the debt.
and the argument got out of hand, and then you killed her.
you say that again.
I dare you to say that again.
answer the question, all right? - No.
I didn't kill my wife.
I'm telling you, he's gonna blow.
what's your buddy's name?
I'm not gonna let you throw up the smoke screen, all right?
you don't know what the hell you're doing, do you?
you got 3 options here. You can pull the trigger,
you can walk out there and take your lumps with the cops,
or you can tell me your buddy's name! All right?!
are you gonna tell me your friend's name?
all right. Now...
OK, thanks. There he is.
Danny Pavelka. - Yeah.
Yeah, we're here to talk to you about the money you loaned Eric Matheson.
what's that got to do with him killing Connie?
he didn't.
well, who did, then?
see, this may come as a surprise to you,
but that's why we're standing in front of you.
well, you just wasted a trip. I just got back in town this morning
from Atlantic city, and I got the motel bills to prove it.
so, how late was he on the loan?
first of all, I didn't loan him jack.
I facilitated a loan. - Who carried the note?
that's my business. You want more?
get a court order. - Danny,
we just ran your sheet on the way over here.
and it clearly states in your parole agreement
that you have to check in with your P. O. once a week.
well, you missed one 2 weeks ago.
he said he was gonna let that one slide.
Oh, really?
well, see,
I'm a little bit more of a stickler.
so, you're gonna tell me everything I want to know
right now!
foster and Reynolds spoke with Pavelka.
Connie found out about the debt.
she went to Pavelka, told him that Eric and she weren't gonna be able to pay the debt.
I'm standing right here.
she begged Pavelka to forgive the debt.
he told her it wasn't up to him, so she has to talk to the guy
who gave Pavelka the money for you...Eric.
his name is Mike Zancanelli.
foster and Reynolds are on their way over to talk to him right now.
you know who this is?
I've never heard of him.
uh...
did he say how Connie found out about the loan?
I don't know.
he did tell Foster that he wasn't surprised she came, 'cause she was always having to clean up your messes, apparently.
that will do, Torres.
why the guilt, Eric?
Foster: That guy right there.
well, it looks like him. the one in the black hat, right?
Yeah.
there's no way he's gonna say squat in front of his boys.
well, then we'll have to take him back to the Lightman Group to talk to him.
what? Heh.
how? Look, look.
this isn't even about saving my job anymore.
most likely, that's gone. I've accepted that.
but if go in there and drag this guy out in front of 15 people,
this whole under-the-radar thing is done.
now, come on, Gillian. I mean, we gave it a shot.
it's time to call this thing in.
Ben, n-no. - What?
there's one thing Matheson said today that I believe is absolutely true.
if he sees the cops... he will pull the trigger.
he will.
Yeah, well, we're out of options, so...
all right. - What are you doing?
no. no. You're not going in there.
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
Oh, god. Be ready.
I'm going to jail.
what do you think?
you--you don't want to know what I think.
Hi. Could I use your phone? Please?
man: Sure. there you go, darling.
thank you.
damn it. Thank you.
Hi. - Hey.
do any of you guys know how to fix a flat?
did you know your wife reached out to Pavelka about the money?
no.
you didn't think you were in trouble not having paid it off?
no.
your wife's death...
and the money that you owed are in no way connected,
in your mind. That's right.
your wife was beaten to death. Your apartment was ransacked.
who do you know who's that angry and wants something of yours?
that describes a lot of people I know, man.
that's your guilt, isn't it? For contaminating her?
you didn't want to drag her into your world.
you considered her a pure soul, and you tried like hell to keep it that way.
and now she's dead.
there's no way you can tell all that just by looking at my face.
well, just the guilt part.
where does the rest come from, then?
well, that's how I feel sometimes about women I know.
did he mean that?
you brought this on her somehow, Eric.
that's one thing you're gonna have to live with, but murder charge isn't.
all right?
and what had you hoped to gain by coming in here?
to be proven innocent? Well, I'll testify to it.
to find out who really killed her?
I'm helping you. All right?
there's no further need for that gun.
you just put it down, you just walk away.
this never happened.
Oh, I wish I knew if I could believe you.
you can. You're gonna have to trust me.
I will tell the police that you were innocent.
just put the gun down.
walk away.
OK.
what the hell is this?
what the hell is this?!
I told you no cops!
I can't believe I trusted your lying ass.
what are we gonna do?
she's good. She'll take care of it.
I thought you said she just makes the tea.
may I help you?
ma'am, we got a call from one of your employees
saying there might be a disturbance here.
um, nope. Not here.
he was very insistent.
he said someone might be armed.
well, I think I would know if someone had a weapon here at work.
tell you what. why don't we take a look just to be safe, ok?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thank you.
so, what was the person's name?
who called this in?
Ugh. I am so sorry, officer. We fired Ray today,
for misuse of company funds. He had to be escorted from the building.
uh, this is him looking for his payback. I guess it's just like him.
is that right?
excuse me.
just let go of me. I'll take care of
I'll do this. I'll do this.
officer: Can you open this, ma'am?
what's the problem?
uh, Moncrief's hassling us again
crank called the cops about someone with a weapon.
you did tell him that's my problem, right?
we were just taking a look around, sir.
"were." that's good. That's past tense.
perfect, 'cause I'm trying to run a business here.
sure. Thanks, man.
thank you.
sorry for the interruption. - Mm-hmm.
have a nice day. No problem.
false alarm.
it's just a matter of time till they come back.
then leave before they do.
my colleagues are out there. They're talking to this Zancanelli character.
they'll get to the bottom of it.
just put the gun down and walk away.
right in here.
who's this? Who's this?
is that Zancanelli?
that can't be.
Ben: So...
how do you know her?
I loaned some money to a friend.
that friend gave it to Connie's husband, apparently.
so, tell me about that conversation, you know, between you and Connie.
it was about the loan.
Connie was under the impression that I gave the money directly to her husband,
while charging him an exorbitant interest rate.
and I didn't.
that would be usury, which is illegal.
and have you ever visited the apartment that Connie shared with her husband?
no.
never been to Eric's wife's apartment.
he just changed nouns-- from Connie to Eric's wife.
Yeah. Plus, he answered no too quickly, and his voice was a different pitch,
a little higher.
Loker: Doesn't make sense killing Connie over 10 grand.
do we even need to know the real answer?
I mean, why can't we just go in there to Matheson with something we cook up?
remember, all we're trying to do is get him to put the gun down and walk out.
no, we still have time, Ben. - To do what?
there's no one else to talk to.
the sister-- Matheson's sister.
she said she was Connie's best friend,
and she definitely was hiding something earlier.
good. Go.
Gwen: Connie came to me a couple of weeks ago,
and she wanted to borrow a digital recorder.
I figured she could just go buy one,
so I assumed she wanted me to ask what she needed it for.
she told me she had a fling with this guy, one-time thing,
and he wanted more, so she was gonna tape their phone conversations.
to get him to back off. - Yeah, that's what I figured.
this guy is married? - Yeah.
she say anything to you after she borrowed the recorder?
she said it worked, um,
but she was gonna keep the file just in case.
her only fear was that Eric might find it.
and when she was killed, I thought maybe he had.
all right. Let me get this straight.
Connie came to you about the loan
you know, how she couldn't pay.
you told her something could be worked out-- you know, a trade.
right? So, she had sex with you.
but you wanted more.
she recorded a phone conversation she had with you
trying to get out of it, and then you went over to Connie's apartment
looking for that recording. didn't you, Mike?
it's like I told the black dude. I've never been to her place before.
you turned the place upside down, and you found that digital recorder.
man. you're in fantasyland, lady. You know that?
she was gonna show it to your wife,
and you lost your temper.
no apartment, no recording,
no dice.
is he lying?
damn straight.
Connie tried to seduce this guy?
she'd never do that. - No, no, you're right.
you're right. And--and she didn't.
but he sexually blackmailed her
to, uh, to pay off your debts.
Eric, we did everything that you--you asked.
let him go.
please.
lock it. Lock her out.
I'm sorry about that.
I mean it.
let's get the cops in now. Let's...
I'll tell them you didn't do it. - No.
Zancanelli is who they brought in. We both know it.
and I want 5 minutes alone with him.
I can't let that happen.
it's either him or you.
I mean it.
uh, after all the headaches you put Connie through
shut up!
after all the headaches you put her through,
after all the hard work she spent
trying to make you feel like a man,
there is one way you can honor her.
and I bet you'll tell me what it is!
live your life! Live your life.
if you take your revenge out on this guy,
you will be the fool that she spent her entire adult life
trying to convince other people that you were!
I have no life without her.
you ready?
I want Zancanelli!
I know you're watching!
I'll do it! I'll do it!
no, no, no, no. I want Zancanelli!
he's gone from contempt to extreme anger.
he's working his way up to shoot. We gotta give him what he wants.
Yeah, right-- just march Zancanelli in there so this guy can shoot him.
welcome to the one thing that I won't do today.
I've got an idea.
look.
you're really gonna make this mistake?
it's either him or you.
well, then, it should be me, right?
open the door.
5 minutes with Zancanelli--that's it.
don't do this, Foster.
you're just gonna talk to him? - Yeah.
he's lying, all right? You can tell he's lying, right?
all right, give me your word. You're not gonna hurt him.
you have my word. I swear.
he's gonna kill him. He's gonna kill him.
I'll bring him in. - He's gonna kill him.
she values your life more than you do.
join the club. Bring him in!
and you-- you get the hell outside!
I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to make sure that this stays a conversation.
then I want your hands up.
hands up!
and you-- you scared yet?
like Connie was?
I want to see that look in your eye.
get out of the way.
get away from him!
your wife wanted me to tell you something before she died.
you got 5 seconds to tell me what she said.
tell me!
Uhh! Oh, god!
Cal: All right.
Ben: Hey
I'll call this in. Ok?
I'll do the talking.
so, what do you do?
all right.
I'm gonna give you an honest answer.
heh, heh, heh. I'm already intrigued.
I try to help people
"try" being the operative word.
I know that must sound foolish
or pretentious or both,
but there it is.
so, describe your ideal woman.
well, I could describe her till the cows come home,
but the real question is whether or not I'm her ideal man.
you never know till you try, right?
Yeah.
why don't we give it a shot?
you know, with some room service...
serve warm honey, right?
I shouldn't be here.
I'm sorry.
Hey. Hi. Hey.
uh, Zancanelli confessed to Connie's murder, so...
I heard. Yeah.
I'm sorry I ran out like that.
no, everybody's dealing with it in their own way.
I'm just...
I'm just glad you're all right.
how's your head?
Ooh. Uh, fine.
listen, I was thinking about that whole, um...
accounts thing, that whole billing thing, you know.
we'd be working out of a shoe box if it wasn't for you. so...
uh, it's all yours. And I'll respect that.
no. No, no. No, you're right.
I mean, cheating spouse cases--I mean,
we're better than that.
all right.
well, whatever you decide, all right? - Ok.
all right, then.
listen, I was just popping by really just to see how you were doing.
um, are you...
I'm ok.
good.
Where's Emily?
she's at her mum's. Oh.
I haven't told them about all of this yet.
can I sleep in your spare bedroom tonight,
if it's not too much of a problem?
of course.
Ah, good.
Hey.
all right.
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event
you really want to help the governor pardon a murderer?
the guy killed a cop.
he started the most vicious Latino gang in DC.
Manny Trillo is the original gangster.
he is responsible for half the crack trade in DC.
guys like that don't change.
not generally, no.
which is why this case is so interesting.
you have a visitor.
lieutenant Governor Goldin.
I hear he's bringing friends.
Hey, lambache.
you going to kiss the governor's ass again or what, ese?
pucker up, ese.
Dr. Lightman.
I'm Lieutenant Governor Goldin.
Mr. Trillo's on his way.
the governor really wants to make him the poster boy for early release?
Manny Trillo was up for a Nobel Prize for the antigang work he's done in here.
we believe he can do even more on the outside.
well, one in every 100 Americans is in prison.
can understand why the governor wants him for a poster boy, right?
of course, before we issue any pardon, the governor wants to make sure Mr. Trillo is truly rehabilitated.
that's why you're here.
I think you should get him out of there.
excuse me? Get him out of there right now.
get down... get down on the ground!
get down on the ground right now.
stay down.
you know, I treated a few firefighters in grad school.
it's amazing what these guys have to deal with.
you got a bit of a fireman thing, huh?
I'm just saying these guys are heroes.
is it the helmets?
I mean, even I like the helmets.
Dr. Foster?
I'm Mike Adams with the National Fire Safety Board.
Hi. Hi.
is that for the firefighter who was killed last week?
Yeah.
Eric Mitchell.
had less than a year on the job.
his grandfather served for 30 years in the 23rd Engine Company.
he stops by almost every day.
Mr. Mitchell.
these are the people from that firm I was telling you about.
well, I'm glad someone is trying to find out what really happened to my boy.
I'm sorry about your grandson.
this just couldn't have been an accident.
we're going to do everything we can to figure out what happened, Mr. Mitchell.
so, that's what it takes to get the feds involved.
grieving relative.
we investigate any time a firefighter's killed on the job.
the building fire was a bad one, a two-alarm blaze.
Eric Mitchell and his company went in, did a preliminary sweep.
now, Eric came out with a kid.
then, he headed back in.
the company got separated.
they didn't find Eric's body until they'd put out the fire.
so, the fire didn't kill him?
the coroner couldn't find a cause of death.
Eric's burns had no inflamed edges.
he was dead before the fire even got to him.
it's unusual, and it raises the possibility that another firefighter killed him and left him there to burn.
I hired you because if someone is lying about what happened in that fire, I need to know.
that won't be easy.
a firehouse is a behavioral in-group.
they become more cohesive in the face of adversity.
is that so?
chief Morrow, Lieutenant Clayton.
you know, that shrink mumbo jumbo won't get you far with our boys.
that's why I won't be interviewing the men.
Dr. Lightman will be conducting the interviews?
no, no, we'll get the most deception leakage from these firemen if they're interviewed by someone that they respect.
so, we won't be asking the questions.
you will.
name? David Caddick.
and how long have you been a firefighter?
eight years.
anything notable?
well, Caddick's okay, but Clayton is biting his lip, tugging at his ear.
he's showing an increase in manipulators.
it's a sign of anxiety.
the lieutenant's nervous?
Yeah, it's normal.
he's already lost one man.
last thing he wants to do is indict another.
tell us about the fire.
our truck, Truck 5, responded right away.
we started searching.
we followed procedure.
one man on the wall, human chain.
wall comes down.
screaming across the hall.
suddenly, we're all in different directions.
we split up.
I was low on oxygen, so I cleared a couple of rooms, and then I hit the door.
and I didn't see Eric again.
I got down the hall.
found an exit.
I didn't see Eric again.
I checked the stairwell.
I left the building.
I didn't see Eric again.
their stories were consistent.
they were.
can you pull up the response latency analysis?
response latency?
it's the time between when a question is asked and the answer is given.
tell us about the fire.
alarm went off at 3: 00 A. M.
tell us about the fire.
we got the call around 3: 00 A. M.
tell us about the fire.
must have been about 3: 00 in the morning.
response time is under a second.
if they were lying, they'd be longer, right?
a lot of people think you take longer to respond if you're lying, but that's just if the lie is spontaneous.
if a lie is prepared ahead of time, you're eager to get it over with.
so, which one of them is lying?
they all are.
something happened in that fire, and from the looks of it, every one of them was involved.
this was the second attempt on Manny Trillo's life this month.
tensions between La Salva and Trillo's old gang have escalated.
Trillo's been speaking out.
a lot of guys want him dead.
the only thing worse than the street violence we'll see if Trillo is killed in prison is the violence we'll see if he takes over El Punio again.
the governor believes Trillo's changed.
he thinks he could do some real good on the outside, but we need to know he's telling the truth, that he's not going back to gang life.
all right.
more than happy to put my reputation on the line.
first couple of years here, I was angry, so I took on the other prisoners.
I took on the guards.
I did a lot of solitary.
got so bad,
I started stealing books from the prison library and carrying them around.
I wouldn't have picked you for a bookworm.
that much time in the hole...
I read anything I could got my hands on.
gardening manuals, economic textbooks,
spanish poetry.
there is no cry of pain without, at its end, an echo of joy.
I read that and...
I don't know.
I caused so much pain.
what joy could come from that?
and then, I'd realized...
I had to be the joy.
that's a charming story.
would you mind?
I missed lunch.
so, you're saying that you regret what you did.
all I cared about was the power, the money.
and I took a life.
just the one?
I ruined the lives of many young Latinos, kids who could have had a chance.
do you have any... plans, you know, for after prison?
I have a plan for street peace.
we need a social agenda for the barrio.
I've been stabbed twice the last month.
15 stitches this morning.
my life is in your hands.
I couldn't agree more.
do you think it might be helpful to clue me into your little experiments?
Nope.
gang leaders like Trillo learn early that respect is key to survival.
they need to respond to perceived disrespect, and it becomes what we call an emotional trigger.
he needs me to believe that he's reformed, but when I talk to him with my mouth full, this is what we get.
nostrils flared.
lips tightened.
anger.
he can't control himself.
disrespect is still a trigger.
you're saying Trillo hasn't changed.
not necessarily.
when he talks about his past, he shows us something else.
and I took a life.
shame.
he's truly ashamed for what he's done.
Yeah, but the anger trigger... No.
that's a survival trigger, and they're really hard to turn off.
doesn't mean he hasn't changed.
you need to compare this to an emotional baseline-- old videos.
call the governor's office and see if they have anything they can send over.
preferably before someone sticks another fork in Mr. Trillo.
Yeah.
no problem.
you see that?
you think you made the right call putting her on this case?
well, who wouldn't want to be on this case?
evolution generally takes millennia, but change in a lifetime, now...
that's something to see.
all the naturals that we have seen, they share two traits.
they are uneducated and...
and the other trait should have nothing to do with the scientific question of whether a man can evolve.
Yes, but psychologically, if she has dealt with a history of...
Hey, if she has strong feelings about Trillo, then she has to learn to put them aside.
Oh, so I guess, if someone's got to teach her how to avoid her feelings, then you're the most qualified.
anything else I can do for you?
I do need some help with my, uh, my firefighters.
well, all three firemen showed increased manipulators, but only two of them showed micro expressions of fear.
well, take me through the one that didn't show fear.
uh, I thought we were looking for the guy most likely to tell us what happened.
we are.
okay. Doug Donovan.
no increased anxiety, no notable signs of...
Oh, stop it there.
take it three seconds back.
freeze it there.
cheeks raised, lip corners depressed...
remorse.
maybe he knows something.
maybe the group is forcing him to lie.
well, he's the one you want to focus on.
monkey with the interview conditions.
keep him with someone he respects.
use the chief. The more guilty the kid feels, the more likely he is to tell you what he knows.
training drill, 1500 Beecham Drive.
truck 5, go, go, go!
all right, men.
we have a fire on the second floor.
and don't lose touch of the man in front of you.
probie, get back in line!
Wallace, take over.
chief Morrow?
what the...?
didn't work out like this for Mitchell, did it?
you saved the chief.
why didn't you save him?
you're not the type of guy to leave a man behind.
Hey, we know how guilty you feel.
there must be a good reason you lied.
come on.
why won't you tell us what happened?
I left him.
I found him in the fire.
I'm supposed to pull him out.
the flames had already got to him, but I'm supposed to pull him out.
I'm just as guilty as those other guys.
what other guys?
the ones who were hazing him.
according to Mr. Donovan, your men have been involved in some pretty extensive hazing.
he wouldn't say who was involved, but it went beyond the silent treatment.
baking soda showers, bottle rockets in the bathroom stalls...
did you know Eric Mitchell had a severe peanut allergy?
no, I didn't.
Donovan heard that slipping Mitchell a little PB&J was the next big gag.
well, he's junior. He wasn't one of the hazers, but that's why he didn't pull Eric's body out.
he was protecting the men.
he thought that they had killed Eric.
were you aware of what was going on?
hazing is as much a part of this life as alarm bells.
and if one of your men goes into anaphylactic shock and dies,
you don't understand, but when you're trapped inside a burning building, you got to know that the other guys are going to put code before cowardice, walk through a wall of fire and come get you.
he's right.
I need men who are willing to risk their lives on a daily basis.
and Mitchell just didn't have it in him.
so you looked the other way?
he needed to learn.
but make no mistake about it,
I demand a certain level of respect out of my men.
there's a line.
and they wouldn't have crossed it.
then you won't mind if we talk to the other men in the company?
no.
Kerry-- the chief's niece-- she'll help you out.
I got real work to do.
it's like they never left the frat house.
you know, it's not just frat houses.
initiation rites can be found in all major cultures.
you're defending these guys?
hazing can serve an important psychological function.
Oh, that's funny.
I don't remember reading any articles in the APA journal on swirlies.
initiation for you MIT mathletes was pretty hard-core, huh?
you make fun, but you try waking up in a shower stall with a killer hangover and a quart of macaroni salad shoved up your...
what?
her self-hushing emblem.
she knows something.
Yeah, she does.
and she's hushing herself because part of her wants to tell.
I knew he was hiding a badge.
shield don't make no difference to me.
chota got what he deserved.
making any headway with the old Trillo videos?
not really.
no evidence of emotional change at all?
Trillo doesn't seem all that different to me.
let's run the tape.
I've been watching video surveillance from before Trillo's arrest.
that's good. Natural habitat
that's the best baseline.
all right...
let's drop the sound and run it side by side with the video we shot at the penitentiary.
anger. Contempt.
contempt.
Trillo's emotional palette was substantially different back then.
I'm surprised you missed it.
shocking.
anger.
disgust.
though, that expression was practically default back then:
the brow lowered, upper eyelid raised, and that glare is the mark of a hostile personality.
how many of these did Trillo flash in the old video?
I don't know.
three or four a minute?
well, he didn't show any in our interview.
not until the burger incident.
seems like a pretty big change to me.
whatever.
well...
well, that is the kind of emotionally detached scientific analysis we value around here.
I'll be sure to pass that on to the governor.
do you have any idea how much worse the Punio-Salva war will be if Trillo gets out and takes over?
much, much worse.
I'm sure there'd be a boom in the crack trade, too.
what if Trillo's just conning us?
well, emotional evidence suggests he's not the same man.
do you know how many kids in the barrio want the kind of power Trillo had before he went away?
the guy is pretty good at working the system.
sure he is.
read your Darwin.
survival of the fittest: it's not about being fit;
it's about being adaptable to change.
violent people are violent.
they don't change.
did you see the message from Lieutenant Governor Goldin's office?
Nope.
Holly Sando, the widow of the officer Trillo killed, has decided to speak to the parole board.
so she's testifying against Trillo's release?
no. She's speaking on his behalf.
tell Goldin we'll be there.
rough interview?
I just...
you know, they're just all so tough.
you know, acting like nothing's wrong.
I mean, the last thing they're going to do is talk to a woman.
I'm sorry. I...
I shouldn't be telling you this.
no. It's...
I understand.
no, it's, it's completely inappropriate.
no...
I know how they can be.
I don't think anybody meant to hurt Eric.
the hazing got pretty bad, huh?
God, they'd... they're going to kill me if they know that I'm talking to you right now.
someone has to.
there's something you should see.
No! No, but what happens on an emergency call when you don't wear your helmet?
what happens on an emergency call when you don't wear your helmet?!
it's milder than I thought it would be.
one of those guys killed Eric Mitchell.
okay, but this just looks like a bad joke.
whoa, wait. Look... look at Wallace.
what? He's smiling.
Yeah, sure, he's enjoying the joke, but, uh...
every time he looks directly at Mitchell...
intense disgust.
that's more than a bad joke.
when Manny Trillo killed my husband, I...
I was angry.
for years, I couldn't even say his name.
then one day, someone told me about his book.
I had a morbid curiosity.
so I went out and bought a copy.
I read the whole thing...in two days.
I was shocked.
how could that man have written such a...?
I was just...
everything I had believed...
it changed the way I look at things.
ms. Sando?
do you believe Mr. Trillo has changed?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I believe he's repented.
he's changed his heart.
and he's changed mine.
that's quite a statement.
Yeah.
of course she doesn't believe a word she just said.
do you believe Mr. Trillo has changed?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
there it is.
slightest head shake no.
now, we do this by accident when we don't mean what we say.
Holly Sando did it every time she said she thought Trillo had changed.
and then there's this.
you can't let him die in this prison.
there.
classic glare, which is a bit surprising from a true believer in Mr. Trillo.
why then lobby for the release of a man who killed your husband if you don't believe he's changed?
she may be trying to convince herself.
maybe she believes he's changed intellectually, but she can't quite get there emotionally.
or maybe Trillo got one of his old buddies to threaten her.
people always think that anger is the most dangerous emotion, but disgust is the language of hatred.
Hitler talking about the Jews.
bin Laden talking about Americans.
and you during the hazing of Eric Mitchell.
what did you have against Eric Mitchell?
the kid made my life hell.
you've been with the department for almost a decade.
how does a probie like Mitchell make your life hell?
nine years.
nine years, and I never had a problem.
I mean, the occasional bad joke, watermelon in the locker.
but I kept my mouth shut.
we're not black. We're not white.
we're firemen.
so we get hazed.
Mitchell gets hazed, he runs to the Vulcans, the Black Firefighter Society.
requested a transfer.
Mitchell made this racial.
so, you had to choose sides?
I tried to protect him, but he was young and proud.
he wouldn't learn.
and the more he pushed, the worse it got.
so, you hopped on the fire wagon.
you found out he had a peanut allergy, and you thought, well, that'll teach him?
Yeah. We did that months ago.
the kid got hives all over, and it was funny as hell, but it didn't kill him.
no.
things got much worse.
my guess-- someone screwed with his equipment.
wasn't you?
I wouldn't touch another firefighter's equipment.
now, I may have hated the kid, but I didn't want him dead.
someone did.
who had the racial problem with Mitchell?
a lot of guys.
it could have been any one of them.
I can't believe Wallace didn't come forward earlier.
Yeah, the black firefighter won't rat on the racists.
it is a little surprising, isn't it?
well, not really.
the firehouse is a more important association for Wallace than race.
and in his mind, race wasn't an issue until Mitchell came along.
you're saying this was Eric's fault?
no, No. This is the new face of racism.
instead of overt prejudice, you see unconscious discrimination.
nobody's joining the Klan, but a lot of people still hire the white guy over the black guy with the same resume?
and when unconscious racism surfaces, it can be lethal.
and then what starts out as reasonable hazing turns deadly.
so, how do we find the men responsible?
we'd like to run the company through a little experiment.
as I said earlier,
I... I've read his books, and I've seen him interviewed, and I really believe that Manny Trillo was a... is a changed man.
I asked Holly Sando to come in, and she wasn't up for it, so,
I pulled her statement to the press after the parole hearing.
I think it's-it's amazing the way he's-he's turned himself around.
she keeps flashing contempt, anger.
she still hates the guy.
you may be right.
Trillo may be threatening her.
no. I told you, everything we've seen from Trillo up till now
the old videotape, the interview
everything suggests he's evolved.
he's not the same man at all.
did any of the reporters ask her why she decided to testify for Trillo?
um, yeah, they did.
miss Sando, tell me, what made you come forward after all these years?
SANDO: I had heard that the governor was considering a pardon, and I thought, well, it...
it-it's time.
eyebrows up, pulled together.
fear.
there's your answer.
stopping by for lunch?
no. Just a question.
did you get someone to threaten Holly Sando?
I'm not threatening Holly Sando.
Really?
because that would be your typical gangbanger move, right?
get in touch with your old familiars.
send her a message.
look, that's not me, not anymore.
you sure you haven't called any of your old friends?
I don't talk to those lacras.
Oh, now, that is not the truth.
you see how you're hunched over?
well, we do that when we're lying.
we try to take up as little space as possible.
and you really ought to work on that anger trigger, mate.
raises the blood pressure, and the heart rate.
it's not good for you.
okay.
the truth is,
I'm in contact with some of them.
I'm working with the gang task force on a truce between Punio and La Salva.
they told me to keep it quiet.
it's dangerous.
but I haven't been sending anyone out after Holly Sando.
I don't believe you.
he hasn't changed.
his truce? Just so that the cops won't notice that he's taking over El Punio again.
nothing is real or a lie.
it all depends on the color of the glass you're looking through.
look, there's so much good I can do if you just get me out of here.
get me out of here, and I'll prove it to you.
over the next ten minutes, you'll be shown a series of images.
each image will be followed by a series of adjectives.
if the adjective describes the image, click yes.
if not, click no.
Hey, Sylvia.
what are you guys up to?
we're testing for racial bias.
people with unconscious bias find it easier to associate positive adjectives with Caucasian faces.
when we shift to an African-American face-- the biased firefighters still associate the adjective with the image.
it just takes them longer.
clock the racist.
Oh, they're all racist.
Yeah, 80% of people who take this test are biased.
we're just looking for the guy who takes the longest.
Oh, they're just about done.
all right, can we, uh, pull up the average association time for each of them?
it's taking David Caddick three times as long to say nice things about African-Americans.
looks like we have a winner.
I am not a racist.
no, you don't think you are.
but it would explain why you took such an active role in the hazing.
I didn't do anything different than the other guys.
you didn't mess with Eric Mitchell's equipment?
I didn't have a problem with Mitchell.
we know that you hated him.
you don't even realize how much you hated him.
how much you hate all of them.
I'm telling you that I didn't have any kind of a racial problem with Mitchell.
but you had another problem with him.
the guy couldn't keep it in his pants.
this was......
about a girl?
you see the disgust?
Yeah.
well, that's hate.
I'm guessing it's racially motivated.
was that your problem?
was it that he was black and she was white?
I didn't know Eric was dating a white girl.
is that why this happened?
well, we're not sure.
racial hatred is about disgust, but when we pressed Caddick about the girl...
the predominant emotion was anger, which suggests that Eric may have crossed some other line.
that maybe Caddick was angry because he disrespected his code.
by dating a white girl?
that's not part of any code that I remember.
well, we don't think this was just any white girl.
might have been another firefighter's girl.
he knew better.
he was smarter than that.
did he ever bring anyone home from the firehouse?
Oh, God...
she came by.
after Eric died.
she was upset.
she brought me a meal.
do you remember her name?
the chief's niece.
should I call DC Gang Task Force?
ask if they've heard of a threat against Holly Sando?
Nope.
Trillo didn't show any deception leakage.
not when he denied threatening Sando, not when was talking about the truce.
he's a criminal.
he's a fantastic liar.
he's an appalling liar.
he's atrocious.
the one time he did lie, he was...
completely transparent; you should've seen that.
so you think he's telling the truth?
I don't think he's going back to the gang.
then why is Holly Sando lying?
if Trillo isn't threatening her, why is she lying for him?
well, I don't know.
could be any number of reasons.
Yeah, but there aren't any.
man, you need to listen to me.
you saw his anger.
you know this guy is violent.
you need... you need to listen to me.
you need to stop making this personal.
I'm not making this personal.
Yeah, you are.
your procerus doesn't move, which means you had your nose fixed, right?
you don't strike me as particularly vain, so...
so what is it then?
who was it?
was it your dad?
your dad smack you around?
I know violent people.
they don't change.
you said so yourself.
once people learn this kind of trigger...
who are you calling?
I think you might be right in a way.
put me through to Lieutenant Governor Goldin, please.
I think you should go ahead and announce Trillo's release.
let him go.
Yeah, just one thing, though.
I have...
I met Eric on his first day.
he was so excited.
he moved here from DC, and he didn't know anyone, so I... I offered to take him out.
I was being friendly, and...
and six months later, he asked me to marry him.
your relationship-- it was a secret?
it had to be.
working in the house, it's like having a dozen overprotective brothers.
and my uncle, he...
he didn't know?
he wouldn't let me date a fireman, not... not one in his house.
that's why Eric put in for a transfer.
I thought that if we made a clean break...
we were going to move to a little town outside of Philly.
he wanted a family.
I had no idea.
I had no idea that they were in a relationship.
that's true.
apologies.
I took the liberty of taping your reaction just now.
when your niece started describing her relationship...
and six months later, he asked me to marry him.
surprise.
so, this has nothing to do with Mitchell's murder?
it did.
Eric Mitchell was killed because he stepped out of line.
he slept with the chief's niece.
he disrespected the code.
now, the chief sets the rules, but he doesn't enforce them.
that's somebody else's job.
I taped you, too.
and six months later, he asked me to marry him.
anger and disgust:
the language of hate.
you?
you killed him?
no.
I didn't.
I just wanted to humiliate him.
he needed to learn humility.
he was one of our men.
no, he wasn't one of my men.
my men respect the code.
my men don't complain when they're forced to broom the latrine, and my men know damn well not to crap where they eat.
for God's sakes, Tommy.
you killed a man.
arrest him.
I was just following the code.
Hi.
what have you got there, a 38?
38 special?
police said you registered that a couple of months ago.
long enough to figure out how to use it, eh?
he's right.
I've been practicing.
drop the weapon!
drop the weapon!
easy now, easy.
okay, everybody, calm down.
move out of the way!
just give me a minute to talk to her.
just want to talk to Ms. Sando.
listen to me.
can you listen to me?
if you have to do this,
I understand.
I want you to know that I understand.
I don't care if you've changed.
I don't care.
Manny, you're still the man who killed my husband.
I know.
you took him away from me.
I know.
you took him away.
I know. And you, you can change all you want.
you can never change that!
I know.
and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
unchained. Got a minute?
Trillo wanted you to have this.
I'm sorry about before.
sometimes I see so much,
I don't know how not to tell people.
Yeah, I get that.
you're right.
most people don't change.
I mean, I've been there, hoping for it, and then they just don't.
but there are a few, I think, who can.
any other life lessons?
when someone bashes you around, who's twice your size, just whenever he feels like it, you learn to read emotions pretty fast.
we adapt to survive.
your abuse made you a natural.
he made you what you are.
well, I'll be sure to thank him.
so what about you?
I'm not a natural.
I had to learn this.
why'd you want to learn?
what, you all of a sudden became obsessed with facial expressions?
I didn't think so.
so who was it?
who made you who you are?
lie To Me
I can't believe you're really here.
you should've called me first.
and ruin the surprise? No way.
you tell mom and dad you were coming out?
are you kidding?
I finished my last final and took the first flight I could get.
they're gonna freak out.
eh, they'll get over it.
so, I figured since you couldn't be home for the holidays, I'd bring a piece of home to you.
what are you talking about?
say hello to my little friend.
Marcus, you can't bring that here.
what's the big deal?
get rid of it now.
Oh, relax. We'll smoke it back at your place.
put it away. Put it back in your pack right now.
Why? - Just do it, Marcus.
don't look at them. Stay calm. Really calm.
what's going on? Who are these people?
they're Yemeni military. Don't say anything.
keep your hands where they can see them.
they have guns. What do we do?
don't say anything.
- Nicole, what do we do?
shut up, Marcus!
Nicole, what do we do? - Don't say a word.
what do we do? - Shut up, Marcus.
Nicole, what do we do?
I... I disrespected the most... holy laws.
I do not deny this.
I'm so sorry for my actions.
I'm deeply... deeply sorry.
I am guilty of my crimes.
I do not deny this.
I also apologize and beg forgiveness.
they sound terrible.
do you hear how terrible they sound?
Diane, you got to... let 'em do their job.
listen, I told you that we're negotiating with the Yemeni government to release your children.
we're just having trouble getting a read on their negotiator, and that is why we hired the Lightman group.
we understand how hard this must be.
we can tell you that last year the Lightman group helped free several American hostages in Colombia.
you have to be patient.
it's been 29 days, and my children are halfway around the world having god knows what done to them.
don't tell me to be patient.
you might have tried a little diplomacy with mom and dad there.
please, I don't have time to hold hands.
the situation's getting worse by the minute.
why are the Yemenis detaining them?
the brother Marcus was visiting the sister on spring break.
yemeni police pulled them over for speeding.
they find an ounce of marijuana in the car.
under Islamic law, trafficking drugs is punishable by death.
Nicole slurred a few words. Have they been tortured?
well, she might have seemed sleep-depved, but Yemeni's definitely not known for its humane treatment of foreign prisoners.
is that their negotiator? - Yep.
guy speaks in monotone, has an endless list of demands, and we have no idea of what he actually needs to get a deal done.
so if you can pick up...anything in his speech or his body language, get a read on him.
we'll take a look at the negotiation footage...
I don't need details. Okay? I need answers.
Nicole and Marcus are being sentenced in two days.
if we don't start making progress, they're gonna be facing execution.
ria Torres.
Dr. Lightman's just finishing up a call.
Oh, great.
you must be the new wunderkind he's told me so much about.
how many times has he lied to you?
excuse me?
well, he said you're a natural.
you must have caught him in some big fat ones?
Yeah, maybe one or two.
one or two? Oh, he's mellowed out.
back in the day, he was pathological.
Really?
Oh, seriously. The morning of my 25th birthday, I look out my dorm window, and there parked outside is a vintage Harley registered in my name.
I have no idea how he pulled that off.
Oh, come on.
I'm serious. That boy lied, cheated, and stole his way through Oxford.
I never stole.
Uh-huh, so you say.
it's good to see you. - And you.
you good? - Yeah, I'm good.
I trust Jeffrey introduced himself. - Yep.
former us surgeon general. Used to be quite an important man.
don't let him fool you. I'm still quite an important man.
something wrong, Jeffrey?
need your help, Cal.
he's 27! Who has a stroke at 27?
Mrs. Coleman, Ribocore will do everything we can to help you.
everything?
what are you doing to track down the people who did this to my husband?
that's Eridema Van. She's the CEO of Ribocore pharmaceutical.
is that one of the companies that throws money at you?
I only take their money if I believe in them.
Erica was a student of mine at Georgetown.
she's one of the good guys.
six weeks ago, someone broke into the Ribocore labs, stole the formula for Priox.
it's their new insulin pill.
recently, a cheaper knockoff version hit the market.
and it's killing people, Cal.
drew Coleman is the third case we've found.
they all took the knockoff.
Priox is a complicated compound.
run the formula the wrong way, and the side effects can be lethal.
well, why don't you just call in the FDA?
fda investigation would take months.
our IT guys say the data theft was an inside job.
only three chemists have lab access.
they're all denying they were involved.
if you could tell us who's lying, we can find out who's making the knockoff and shut them down.
if we don't get this counterfeit drug off the market soon, we are looking at hundreds of deaths.
okay, the Ribocore theft took place at 2: 27 A. M.
in testing lab 290.
now, one of you...
disabled the scanner so it couldn't identify your key card.
you know, I'm a chemist, not an engineer.
I wasn't even in the building that night.
now, you managed to avoid the security cameras...
you know, this is ridiculous. I've worked for Ribo corp for 15 years.
but one of you, when you downloaded the Priox formula...
left your fingerprint on the data port.
well, you can check mine.
uh, come on. I use that computer all the time.
so do I. I mean, you can't possibly think...
no, I can't. So you two can go.
so... why'd you steal the Priox formula?
I didn't. Go ahead. Eck my fingerprints.
you didn't leave any. - I made that up.
what are you talking about?
the thief wore gloves.
but you knew that, didn't you?
that's why you leapt at the chance to prove your innocence.
only a guilty person...
would know that a fingerprint couldn't possibly be theirs.
all right, call Vandeman and tell her we found who stole the information.
it's not what you think.
no, see, it's not what you think.
that formula you sold, your knockoff Priox, it's killing people.
you're wrong. I didn't break in to the lab to steal the formula.
why, then?
two months ago, I came across a lab study that said stroke was a possible Priox side effect.
Vandeman had buried the full report, but it was in the database in testing lab 290.
I was trying to build a case against the drug.
the problem isn't knockoff Priox.
it's the real drug that's the killer.
this is new.
I asked Grace not to let anybody back here.
I'm going on Larry King to talk up the new flu vaccine, so this is just, you know, saving time.
does your missus know how much you spend on makeup?
no. And unless you want Larry King to know how you got drunk - and talked your way past White House security... - never happened.
Oh, that never happened? Well, this never happened either.
I need to talk to you about Erica Vandeman.
Derek, just, uh, give us a second. Thanks.
you find out who broke into the lab and stole the formula?
the chemist who broke into the lab wasn't after the formula.
Really?
...Early-stage testing on Priox...
...blood clotting leading... to stroke.
what, this chemist is pretending to be some kind of a whistle-blower?
her study says that the real drug is the killer.
Cal, it doesn't make sense. Why would Erica hire you?
damage control?
you hire us, and you...
spin this into a story about a counterfeit drug.
no, not Erica. I mean, if she thought this drug was killing people, she'd be first to pull it off the market.
well, the chemist doesn't appear to be lying.
and the study indicates...
indicates what? What does it indicate? It indicates nothing.
maybe the lab was careless. Maybe they made a mistake.
so you think I should talk to them?
I have known Erica Vandeman for years, and you spent, what, five minutes with this chemist?
I'm as worried about this drug as you are.
so give me the name, and I will look into this.
okay.
Hey, Heather.
Gillian, what are you doing here?
we're working with Peterson the Yemeni negotiations.
is my husband...?
he's at lunch.
well, tell him I stopped by.
you're here early.
I like to be prepared.
well, you're not billing me for it.
Where's the chia pet?
Yeah, that guy definitely needs a shave and haircut.
he's monitoring the closed-circuit cameras so he can do stress analysis on the Yemenis.
but I'm sure he'll appreciate the tip.
very funny.
Dr. Gillian Foster, meet deputy ambassador Hassan.
it's a pleasure meeting you.
I trust you've been briefed on our position?
she wouldn't mind hearing it again.
very well. We have several demands.
Yes, I'm sure, but actually, I'd prefer to hear it from...
deputy ambassador Rafik.
I'm happy to oblige.
as deputy ambassador Hassan was saying, we have several demands.
well, you don't know what the hell you're doing.
we have two days, and you wasted the entire session talking to Rafik?
the guy's a mid-level bureaucratic schlub.
actually, he's not.
Loker, can you pull up the Camp David video?
this is Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak at Camp David.
see how they're trying to shove each other through the door?
in the middle east, appearances are very important.
the most powerful person is always the last through the door.
when the Yemeni delegation entered the room, your man Hassan wasn't the last one through the door; Rafik was.
that's why you couldn't get a read. Hassan's a puppet.
he has no idea which demands are important.
they wanted us to go down to the wire so they could get the best deal.
they were trying to keep us in the dark.
okay, so did you get anything off of Rafik?
well, we got clear vocal spikes on the demands he cares about the most.
of course, he wasn't the only one.
Yes, obviously, it goes without saying that any deal must secure the release of both Nicole Bradin and her brother Marcus.
we hired you to focus on the other side of the table, not ours.
well, we catch the lies wherever they come from.
and the vocal stress in your voice is three times higher when you mention Nicole.
you care more about getting her released than Marcus. Why?
we can't do our jobs unless we know your priorities.
I'm only going to say this once.
I want Marcus released just as much as Nicole.
you got it?
I'm only going to say this once: Classic qualifying statement.
he wouldn't need it if he was telling the truth.
will you get a hold of Nicole and Marcus' confession videos?
let's see what we can pick up.
Hey, I just set up a meeting with Neeman labs for tomorrow morning.
Yeah, postpone it.
I thought you wanted to talk to them about the mouse study.
Jeffrey's looking into it. - Dr. Buchanan?
Yeah. I told him about Aisha, told him about the study.
he said he'd look into it.
what, so we're just dropping it? - For now.
you think this one is ever going to stop talking back?
I hope not.
half day? - Hope you don't mind.
had an hour free for dinn thought I'd steal her away.
no problem.
what? What now?
you saw her covering, right?
I mean, you saw how upset she looked.
Congratulations.
once again you've arrived at the apparently foreign destination of none of your damn business.
man, I don't get you. - Good. Stop trying.
fine. Pretend like you don't give a damn what's going on with her.
I know you do.
sit down. Sit down.
look, in case you haven't figured it out yet, it's different when you're one of us.
everybody has things they don't wish to share.
she's your friend.
you're not listening to me.
in this workplace, with everything that we see, we have to be very clear on the rules.
you and Foster have rules?
if there's something she wants to tell me, she will.
everything else--everything else I see, I ignore.
I trust her to take care of herself.
wow, when did you get religion?
you trust Foster. You trust Buchanan.
you were there. Aisha Ward was telling the truth.
jeffrey will get to the bottom of this.
he brought us the case. Don't you think he's just a little biased?
okay.
how many people in this world do you trust? How many?
I don't know. Ten.
six.
well, when you get to my age, there'll be three.
and when one of those people asks you for 24 hours, you give it to him.
Dr. Lightman.
Dr. Buchanan left you a message.
well, can you get him on the line?
Yeah, but you might want to take a look at this first.
guess he did get to the bottom of it.
really nice to meet you. Thank you so much for your hospitality.
tell Larry I'll come back any time he'd like. Thank you.
you gave us Aisha Ward.
and a good evening to you, sir.
you went straight to Vandeman.
you didn't even bother to call.
well, Cal, I didn't realize we were going steady, but I did try you at your office.
Hey, there are serious questions here.
I stopped investigating.
Cal, you were not hired to investigate Ribocore.
you were hired to investigate who broke into their lab.
the drug's killing people.
I have six lab reports on Priox, including a 9, 000-person study.
Priox did not cause strokes in any of them.
only the knockoff does that.
Ribocore's issued a warning and they're working with police to find the distributor.
you read through this study?
Vandeman walked me through em, yes.
Oh, really? - She also showed me this.
the police did a little more digging.
Aisha ward had $500, 000 wired into her savings account from an offshore bank just before the break-in.
that would be four times her annual salary.
she stole the formula, Cal. She stole it. She sold it.
now she's trying to cover it up.
I'm not easily fooled, Jeffrey.
I know. That makes her one hell of a liar.
what do you want?
well, I love being duped.
doesn't happen often, but, you know, I'm intrigued.
so, we can either chit chat or...
you can tell us the truth.
I gave you the truth, and you ran right back to Vandeman.
you're incredible...
you're incredible. You're incredible.
you know, it's not hard to find a good liar, but...
a truly great one... that's rare.
I am not lying.
well, your bank statement says you are.
500 grand wired to your account.
now, that sounds about right for the formula to a billion-dollar drug, so who did you sell it to?
doesn't matter.
Oh, so you admit it. You sold the formula?
sure, I sold it, but I didn't need to break into the lab for that.
I knew the formula by heart.
I sold it months before the break-in.
so, why break into the lab at all?
I told you.
I found the summary for the mouse study. I wanted the full report.
mouse study was an outlier. Just one bad test.
did you talk to Neeman labs?
that study is evidence that Priox is a killer.
Yes, I sold the formula, but then, I found the study and...
it tore at my conscience. I had to do something.
so, first, corporate thief...
then, whistle-blower. That's what you want us to believe, right?
please.
someone has to get Priox off the market, and the knockoff I sold is the same as the real thing, and the real thing is killing people.
go to Neeman labs. They'll tell you.
thanks for seeing us at such short notice, Dr. Dembeck.
uh, no problem. It's, uh... it's a light day.
very light.
want to ask you a couple of questions about, um, some testing you did on a drug called Priox.
uh, I have nothing to say.
why is that? 'Cause you botched the test?
anger's real.
no shame, no guilt.
maybe Ribocore didn't like what they got back in the report.
so, what, did they, uh, just drop you as a client, then?
they fired us... okay?
they blackballed us and gave the drug to a lab that would give them the results that they wanted, that would test it into compliance.
and then, after that, there was no more testing?
Priox. No, but I have heard rumors about some of the other studies.
you know, I got into this business to do cutting-edge research to try to help people.
apparently, science and business just don't mix.
have you seen Dr. Lightman?
he went down to the hospital. Dc general.
what for?
our Priox victim, Drew Coleman-- he had another stroke.
he's being taken off life support.
Oh, my god.
that's not all. I found anecdotal evidence online.
two more stroke cases linked to Priox.
both victims young, both in good physical shape.
that's still not gonna be enough to get it pulled off the market.
Torres told me you were here. Is everything okay?
well, for Mr. Coleman it's not.
maybe Aisha Ward was right.
you don't have to do this.
if you want to choose your friendship first, you can just hand this over to the authorities.
let somebody else investigate it.
Yeah, I'm sure they'd do a bang-up job.
I'm just saying that... you can walk away.
what if the drug really is killing people?
come on. I need to show you something back at work.
I'm so sorry for my actions.
I'm deeply, deeply sorry.
so, like I told you, we think the state department's more interested in getting his sister out.
there's nothing noteworthy here.
Yeah, but check out Nicole.
I also apologize and beg forgiveness.
at first we thought it was just sleep deprivation, but she doesn't look fatigued.
no slouching, no leaning.
I mean, I guess that could be adrenaline.
no, she's not sleep-deprived.
she's slurring her words intentionally.
the U.S. should leave Iraq now.
saddam Hussein is a great leader.
I don't understand. Who is this soldier?
he's an American pow from the first gulf war,
it's a code; the army teaches soldiers to slur their words if captured or forced to give a confession.
the enemy can't hear the difference, but it signals that they haven't broken you.
it's part of the military survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training.
military training?
neither of our children have any military training.
the state department files don't mention any.
I'm sorry. What are you saying?
Diane, please... - don't do that, Robert!
you've been telling me to be calm this whole time.
now, Marcus is a poetry major, for god's sake!
what about your daughter?
this is a joke. - Mr. Bradin?
to my knowledge, Nicole's never been involved with the military.
"to my knowledge." Are you telling us everything?
Mr. Bradin, I can't be effective without all the information.
I can't give you all the information.
Robert, what are you talking about?
I can't tell you.
I'm not supposed to know. I'd be breaking the law.
she's U.S. intelligence. She's a spy.
what the hell were you thinking?
uh, excuse me?
our firm has a reputation for discretion. You have secrets, you tell us.
otherwise, we can't do our job.
I still don't know what you're talking about.
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Nicole Bradin is a spy.
how was I supposed to tell you that?
it's classified information.
get a lot of people killed, including Nicole.
I wish I had known that earlier.
Yeah, well, maybe now you'll understand why I'm taking the deal.
wait. What deal?
rafik called an hour ago.
he's offering to hand over one of the prisoners in exchange for their humanitarian demands.
we're getting Nicole back.
we'll do what we can for Marcus.
no, that is a terrible call.
it'll tear the family apart.
Nicole will never be able to live with herself.
okay, do you understand that woman knows the address to every CIA safe house in the middle east?
and you're worried about her feelings?
Rafik's demanding patriot missiles for Marcus.
so, it's a nonstarter. We're done here.
I am getting Nicole back home before the Yemenis find out who she is, and that is it.
Dr. Foster.
Mr. Bradin, what are you doing here?
the, uh, state department hasn't been returning calls. I didn't know where else to go.
this is Ms. Mcdermott from the red cross.
one of their nurses was allowed to visit Marcus yesterday and she managed to get these photos out.
what happened?
apparently, he tried to escape.
the Yemeni guards beat him severely.
he has broken ribs and a concussion.
he hasn't been allowed to see a doctor.
our nurse demanded that Marcus be transferred to a medical facility for treatment.
she was told there was no point in treating him.
Marcus is going to be sentenced tomorrow.
and then they're going to execute him.
they're gonna shoot my son.
please. You gotta get him out.
you need to raise the acidity if you want it to act as a compound.
Oh, scientist and a businesswoman.
no wonder Jeffrey was such an advocate.
Dr. Lightman, Ms. Torres. This is a pleasant surprise.
I'm sorry about the unexpected pop-in, but I find the more time one has to prepare a lie, the harder it is for me to spot.
okay.
would you excuse us for a moment?
so, what can I do for you?
Oh, well, um, some of the pharmaceutical journals found out that I was involved in the case and they, uh, called with a couple questions.
so, I thought I'd just run a few things by you.
sure.
uh, well, first then...
the real Priox versus the knockoff drug.
what exactly is the difference?
well, it's complicated.
it has to do with the way that you run the compound.
all right, well... try me.
I was quite a chemist back in Oxford.
there's certain proprietary information.
why don't you have the journals refer to me on that one?
okay.
how about the mouse study Ms. Ward keeps mentioning?
there's nothing to it.
no other Priox testing showed any side effects.
and all these labs are on the up-and-up, right?
I am intimately involved with every one of those companies.
I trust them all.
Oh, well, that's good.
cause it's quite hard to find a company one can trust these days, right?
so, she bit her lip every time I went at her.
incredibly anxious.
I don't know how we missed earlier.
well, lie detection's all about asking the right questions.
shame. They were paying top dollar, too.
you calling reporters?
no, made them up.
uh, Vandeman will be trying to track them down, which will buy us a little time.
time for what?
Heidi? Yeah.
can you make an appointment with, uh, Jim Gunderson of the FDA?
tell him it's urgent. Yeah, I'm on my way back.
it's mice, Cal. It's one study.
Yeah, well, Vandeman's lying about the other tests.
well, even if you're right, there's not enough here to pull Priox off the market.
I can start investigation, but I can't do more than that.
fda investigation stake months. A lot of people could die, Jim.
well, if you can prove that Vandeman manipulated the Priox testing,
I'll recall the drug immediately.
but without more hard data, my hands are tied.
all right, well, uh, do you mind if I use your name?
throw it around, see if I can open a few doors?
you should start with your friend Buchanan.
he was a driving force behind the drug's approval.
Buchanan pushed the drug?
Yeah, I can show you about a dozen letters he submitted on behalf of Priox.
you do know he's on the Ribocore payroll?
he's not involved in this.
jeffrey encouraged me to come and talk to you.
I mean, he's as eager to get to the bottom of this as we are.
jeffrey encouraged me to come see you?
all right, the wall sat the FDA have ears.
Yeah, well, then I'm sure they can tell you were lying, too.
Hey, if Jeffrey knew what was going on, he'd have come to the FDA himself.
the guy's on the payroll. He pushed the drug through FDA approvals.
you can't really believe that.
look, if Jeffrey knows about Priox, he's going to jail, but I'm gonna be damn sure before I send him there.
all right? - Okay.
good.
I thought you said Peters was making the deal.
just because he's done doesn't mean we are.
he's almost comical with the sound off.
I'm trying to concentrate here.
well, he's got the best posture I've ever seen.
he looks like Mussolini.
he's trying to make himself look bigger.
men, gorillas, blowfish.
you know, when they want to appear dominant they puff themselves up.
this guy's definitely compensating for something.
maybe you're on to something.
rafik really cares about appearances.
he wants to look like a leader.
that could be our leverage.
Hey, I thought I heard you come back in.
Where's Torres?
I sent her off to talk to labs that tested Priox.
you know, Jeffrey always loved the limelight.
can't tell you how many times I'd come home, switch to the news, and there he is...
in my living room...
pushing some new drug or other. - Cal...
merry-go-round of government, business, and media.
enough money and fame to make heads spin, I suppose.
do you really think Jeffrey's guilty?
I don't know. I don't know.
you know, when my mother died, Jeffrey took the train back to London with me.
I'd only known him for about a month.
but he skipped out of college and...
came with me just to keep me company.
so, honestly, I don't know.
Hey, I've got something you should see.
so, I went to all six Priox testing labs.
I didn't get anything until I talked to the researcher at the lab that did the 9, 000-person study.
he show signs of deception leakage?
Yeah, he looked like he was about to hurl, so,
I came back and pulled a video of Vandeman talking about that study.
Priox promises to help the millions living with diabetes.
an intensive 9, 000-person study...
same lip bite. She does it every time she talks about that study.
and given the depth and the breadth of this 9, 000-person study...
just like today. She is totally freaked out.
she's not the only one.
what? He's just staring at the floor.
Yeah, watch.
he looks at her when she's talking about the study and then catches her eye and then looks down and away.
signs of... - Guilt.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
I still remember you bounding into morning lab straight from the poker tables, having hustled some jackass out of 100 pounds.
seems like a thousand years ago.
Yeah. I could read you back then.
not as well as you thought.
what?
I spoke to Gunderson at the FDA.
we know the 9, 000-person study is a sham, so if you've got anything to say, you should say it now.
Cal, I have no idea what you're talking about.
she's selling a killer drug.
we spoke to the testing labs. We watched heron tape.
Aisha Ward was telling the truth about Priox.
if Vandeman's lying...
are you serious? - Yeah.
and I know you're helping.
Oh, and you think that I would do something like that?
tell me it's not true. - It's not true.
you're lying. I can see it in your face.
no, I'm not. - Yeah, you are. You're covering.
you are unbelievable, you know that?
I saw the guilty look you have when you watch Vandeman.
you're involved in this.
there's no "this," Cal. Okay?
Erica and I are having an affair. That's it.
we're having an affair, okay? You happy now?
you're cheating on Sarah?
are you going to lecture me about marriage now?
cause, you know what? That would be rich you really had no idea she was manipulating the data.
you know something. For somebody who studied emotions their entire life, you really don't understand them at all.
you have to stay away from her, Jeffrey. - Okay.
mean it. This investigation's going to get ugly.
Erica's going to jail. You can't call her.
you can't email her. You can't be near her when that happens.
I mean it. Stay away from her.
thanks for the friendly advice.
Mr. Peters, I just got your message.
I thought we had a deal.
we have another proposal.
there's only an hour until sentencing.
please. Hear us out.
I'm listening.
in return for the pardon and release of Nicole and Marcus Bradin, the United States is prepared to meet all Yemen's humanitarian demands.
this is an insult.
ambassador Rafik.
to thank you for putting aside your military demands, we would like to show our gratitude.
what's this? - It's an invitation.
a state dinner.
honoring the republic of Yemen.
only leaders held in the highest esteem are hosted at the White House.
the president's social secretary has a few dates in mind, and the chief of staff has assured me already that you'll be seated beside the president himself.
I almost forgot we had a date.
we need to talk. - Jeffrey.
I think we should go to your office.
Hey, how did you get Buchanan to go for this?
you didn't tell him.
I did not doctor the report.
then why is the 9, 000-person study so perfect?
why are there no outliers?
you and I both know every drug has side effects.
Priox has almost none at all.
how is that possible?
you doctored the report.
we were behind.
the drug had been promised to market. The stock price was falling.
the board was all over me.
what would you have done?
postponing the Priox launch would have put Ribocore into bankruptcy.
I think we got enough, don't you? Shall we?
we have two choices: Destroy the company or put out the drug and hope for the best.
hope for the best? - We have been working on a new pill.
we've got the blood clotting under control.
we're about to reintroduce Priox to market.
if you can just buy me a few months...
buy you a few months? Did you just say, "buy you a few months"?
what about Drew Coleman? What about the other victims? Tell me.
I just need a few months.
Dr. Vandeman, you're under arrest.
Cal? What the hell's going on?
Oh, you can drop it now, Jeffrey.
FBI have got what they want.
I'm pulling Priox off the market immediately.
thanks for your help, Jeffrey.
I prefer to get the truth in person, but sometimes we just have to make do.
Yeah. Okay.
you should have told me, Cal.
should have warned me the feds were listening.
told you to stay away from her.
what if I'd offered to protect her? What if I'd agreed?
I knew you wouldn't.
Oh, so now you have faith in me?
you know, I can count on one hand the number of people I'd do anything for.
you were one of 'em.
I would've lied for you. Jeffrey.
I wish I could believe that.
and earlier this evening, the state department successfully convinced the Yemeni government to pardon and release Nicole and Marcus Bradin.
this is a proud new step in what we hope will continue to a productive friendship with the united states.
well, at least one of us had a good day.
you saved his reputation and kept him out of jail.
jeffrey will come around eventually.
you've known each other too long.
one second.
Hi, honey.
uh, yeah, I just got back to the office.
okay.
Yeah, no, no, uh, I... I understand.
do you want me to pick something up?
all right, well, just let me know if you change your mind. Okay.
Alec stuck at work?
we're almost on the right schedule.
you know, I spend my day sat the state department. He spends his nights there.
you want to grab some dinner?
I'd love to.
but I've got to take care of something. Rain check?
sure.
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event
Nana!
Nana!
someone, please!
my family is still inside!
Nana!
my daughter's still in there with my mother-in-law! Please!
we'll find her.
you need to stay with your family.
Nana, please wake up!
Nana!
it's okay.
are you all right?
it's okay, I got you.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
get my Nana! It's too dangerous. Come on.
I have to get my Nana!
you can't help her now. Let go of me!
Dr. Lightman.
Hey.
Bernie Madoff.
that's anxiety and regret.
tell that to the Science Times, all right? Okay.
you've got messages from Wax at the SEC, Kob at Treasury and the FBI wants to schedule another lecture. Also...
no downturn in the lie business.
good morning.
you should put that down.
what, you don't like women in masks anymore?
no, it's 'cause it's one of a kind.
could you... yeah, could you put that down?
never mind.
I do so like it when you get flustered.
it's rare, but highly enjoyable.
why are you here?
you have such a gift for small talk.
really, you should've just gone into the hospitality businesses.
opened yourself up a little bed and breakfast somewhere.
ria Torres. Zoe Landau.
Hi. Assistant...
assistant U. S. Attorney.
you always did like them so young.
excuse me?
his proteges- they're usually young.
it's easier for him to try to...
mold in his image.
is there a reason you're here?
I have a case. I need your help.
you want to hire me?
well, I don't want to remarry you.
what, do you have problem working for your ex-wife?
my daughter is in a hospital bed with second-degree burns.
my wife's mother is dead.
my house is gone.
this case is a top priority for us, Mr. Ambrose.
so why hasn't anything been done?
why isn't that son of a bitch in jail?
you know that he did this.
Frank, she's asking for you.
I want Garcia behind bars.
he thinks you know who started the fire?
well, I have a witness who saw Jack Garcia running from the Ambrose house right after the fire started.
that TV reporter?
Yeah.
he and Ambrose were friends in high school, but they had a falling out.
so you have a witness that can put Jack Garcia at the scene of the crime?
what's the problem?
the witness has a slight credibility issue.
who's the witness?
my mommy left me outside.
she went back in the house to look for Maggie and Nana.
that's when I saw Mr. Garcia.
Hey, AJ, you ever tell a lie?
it's all right, honey.
that's all right, we all tell stories.
but, today, I need you to tell me the truth.
I am telling the truth.
I saw Mr. Garcia.
he ran out of the cellar.
you know the story of "The Little Boy Who Cried Wolf"?
he said the wolf was there when it wasn't.
so no one helped him when the wolf really came.
that's right.
he told a lie.
and the wolf ate him.
if you don't tell the truth, the wolf's going to come back and he's going to eat you.
what is this? What are you doing?
did you see Mr. Garcia? I saw him running away.
I want you to tell me the truth now. I am telling you the truth.
the wolf's going to come back here and he's going to eat you up. You scarring!
I saw him. I need you to tell me the truth.
he killed my Nana.
okay. Leave my son alone.
OK
you used to be so good with children.
we don't want an innocent man going to prison for 20 years.
AJ was showing no signs of deception, so I raised the stakes a bit.
and he still wasn't anxious.
not I see him tell the truth actually
good!
let's talk to Jack Garcia.
my place or yours?
mine. I want Foster to evaluate AJ.
Ah, yes, Gillian.
what was that?
I didn't say anything.
what?
let's talk to the accused, and get you some medication.
thanks to my college buddy, Army Lieutenant David Kanuth,
I know how hard it is for our wounded veterans to return home.
I'm Jack Garcia, and this is What I Know.
this is What I Know.
that really put you on the map, right?
selling the misery of your old friends.
that's kind of what you do.
you're saying I burned down a man's house, so I could report on it?
well, aren't you in the running for some big new cable show?
I mean, the story of an old friend losing everything could help you along nicely.
you do not want to be interrogated by this man, trust me.
it's kind of fun when you're not on the other end, though.
I told you, we drifted apart.
I have no problem with Frank Ambrose.
never have.
all right, so, bad reporter, good liar.
not a great one.
when he talks about Ambrose, this is what we get.
contempt.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm familiar with that one.
I think we should probe the relationship between Ambrose and Garcia- see what we can come up with.
sounds like fun.
what?
can I talk to you for a minute?
she's calling.
no.
what no?
you know what.
We-we-we have never worked for her before.
we are not starting now.
it's an interesting case.
no- there are plenty of interesting cases.
do you not remember what it was like after she left?
you wore the same shirt to the office every day for a month.
I still do.
you saw the head tilt.
she's flirting with you.
no, that's ridiculous.
she does this to you every time. No.
she is single again, Cal.
no, no, she's been with Roger for what?
for the best part of a year now, right?
is she still? Did you ask her?
I don't know, look, I'm taking the case.
I'll be fine.
Cal... I'm in complete control of myself
which is more than I can say for you, following me into the men's room.
the women's room, Cal.
the women's room.
why don't you tell us what really happened between you and Frank Ambrose.
I told you nothing happened.
we haven't been friends in years.
why not?
you grow older, things change.
now, I, um...
now we have nothing in common.
why do you feel contempt for him then? I never said that I don't.
you're going to have to learn to lie better than that if you want a real career in front of the camera.
uh, look...
Frank called me about six months ago.
he'd just been laid off, seemed desperate, so I asked him if there's anything I could do.
that's one of my favorites, that one.
I mean, it's amazing how many times people say that and they don't mean it, right?
Yeah, well, he asked me for money and I gave it to him, okay?
you lent a guy money that you hadn't talked to in years?
Yeah, we shared a past.
that meant something to me.
apparently not to him.
I called Frank a month ago- see how he was doing, and that ungrateful son of a bitch acted like I was squeezing him for the money he owed me.
and now his boy is accusing me of burning down his house.
you're damn right I feel contempt.
he sounded convincing.
Yeah, and he looked it.
you said that about the Ambrose boy.
I mean, they both can't be telling the truth.
what, are you losing your touch?
I'll evaluate the boy.
he may not be able to tell the difference between fantasy and reality.
AJ may be imagining what he saw.
if he believes in his fantasy, it could appear that he's telling the truth.
I'm going to work on something a little bit more tangible.
I'm going to get the FBI to do checks on Garcia and Ambrose.
but feel free to talk to the boy.
take him to the zoo, if you like.
that's Roger. I should probably take this.
how's it going between you two- is it good?
Yeah, it's great.
Hey.
Oh, I love you, too.
I miss you.
well, that was a lie. What?
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, she's been with Roger for a long time, and if there was something serious, she would have told me, right? Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Hey, I filled up all the printers... Yeah, could you call the Ambrose family - see if they can bring their kid by this afternoon?
scheduling meetings- fantastic.
Yeah. Hey, where you going?
I'm going to go help Torres get started on the Southeast drive-by shooting.
you know, who better than me to get inside the world of gangsta rappers.
sweet place.
for a guy who raps about being true to the hood,
Caden doesn't exactly put his money where his mouth is.
detective Riley.
Dr. Foster, Ms. Torres, thanks for coming.
is that the, uh...
kid who was murdered?
Yeah. Dante Edwards.
three nights ago, he was leaving a club when he took two bullets to the chest in a drive-by.
you think Caden shot him?
Caden was seen arguing with Dante at a party last week.
Dante is part of Little Sid's entourage.
he's a rival rapper.
he and Caden have a big feud.
Caden's a bad man.
he raps about how he's killed half a dozen men.
we nail him for this, we can put him behind bars where he belongs.
you get any shots right here right?
that's what I do.
that's what I go for right now.
now, that looks good.
on to the next.
you got a second to talk to Detective Riley?
I don't talk to cops, man.
my manager will show you to the door.
look, I'm sorry. My cousin's not a snitch.
you know what would happen to album sales if people knew you all were here?
listen, Davis, your cousin doesn't want to cooperate, we'll bring him in.
I can dig it.
everybody, find another room- the party's over.
now.
what?
did you know Dante Edwards?
Wow.
that's a lot of regret for a killer. Look, I didn't kill him.
you got a lot of loyal folks in your entourage.
maybe you got one of them to do it.
let me tell you something.
look, me and my cousin grew up with Dante.
he lived three doors down from us in the Carollsburg projects.
and you're coming up in here - Cade, Cade, Cade...
no, no, no. Let me explain something why I'm upset right now.
the world should know this is unacceptable to me.
the world should know this, B, and you're coming up in here and accusing me of killing somebody that I grew up with?
are we finished yet?
I haven't heard an alibi.
my cousin and I were here, watching the Carver-Nova game.
Caden seemed to be telling the truth.
yeah... and his sadness was for real.
you're saying you believe the guy?
the rivalry with Little Sid's crew, the argument, both point to Caden.
okay, but why would a killer show remorse for his victim?
FOSTER: Okay...
AJ, what about this one?
that's Santa Claus.
Yeah, it is.
tell me about Santa.
he has a sleigh and reindeer.
he brings me presents.
Shh.
quiet.
have you ever seen Santa?
no.
I always fall asleep.
but I think I heard him on the roof once.
Shh. I told you. Quiet, now.
who are you talking to?
that's Penelope.
quiet. I told you, be quiet.
you did that.
eh? You did that.
Penelope did that.
you're making that up.
now, that's not fair. She thinks you're cool.
there's no one there.
she told me that she thought that you were super cool.
you're weird.
your imaginary friend Penelope?
Yeah, it's the only girl I know tells me the truth.
Hey.
what? Oh, sorry.
so...
it's clear AJ can tell the difference between reality and fantasy, right?
Yes, but that was your fantasy.
he's a little fuzzier when it comes to his own,
I mean, he's still at the age where he thinks Santa's real.
so you think he imagined Garcia running away from the fire?
Yeah, I think so.
but I'll still get him to draw some more.
it's a more direct line to his unconscious.
I'm not sure we'll need it.
we still have a receptionist here, don't we?
Jack Garcia wasn't the only person that Frank Ambrose owed money to.
the guy's under a mountain of debt- credit cards, student loans, you name it. Take a look at this.
homeowner's insurance.
housing prices have dropped, but his home was insured at the value it had before the market collapsed.
his house was worth more to him in ashes than it was standing.
you think I'd burn down my own house?
I lost everything in that fire.
you made a lot of money when the house went down.
that doesn't make me an arsonist.
Jack Garcia told us how desperate you were.
Jack Garcia is the one who did this.
he's a user.
he lives off the suffering of everybody else.
now, you believe that, don't you?
come on! My son saw him.
what is the matter with you people?
so, how long are you stuck here?
my doctor said I could go home at the end of the week.
it's not so bad.
it's been kind of cool here.
Really?
all my friends came by.
and it's nice having my family around.
my dad hasn't left.
Oh, yeah? What about your mom?
Yeah, she's been here, too.
do you believe Mr. Ambrose?
Yeah. Most of what he said.
but I'm interested in what the daughter told you.
the family would've been through a lot and the kid would've seen the worst of it.
what have you got?
a lot of anger from Maggie towards mom.
mom?
what are you doing?
looking at Mum.
how did you know Mr. Garcia?
he's friends with my daddy.
she's holding her breath.
anxiety.
I think I know why Maggie's so angry.
that's great, AJ, okay. Now, can you draw for me what you saw the night of the fire?
I'm not done. That's all right.
I don't need to talk to AJ.
uh, what was your relationship with the man that your son's accused?
excuse me?
were you having an affair with Jack Garcia?
how dare you accuse me of having an affair in front of my son!
Yeah. You're avoiding the question.
are you having an affair with Jack Garcia?
I'm getting my son and I'm going.
that's fine, but we'll be back with a subpoena.
I suppose we could always talk to your husband and find out what he knows about it.
nine months ago, I was out shopping and Jack walked up to me in the store.
he had so much confidence.
Frank had lost his job.
we were really struggling.
we had stopped having sex altogether by then.
so you had an affair?
every minute with Jack was a chance to be with somebody who didn't know me or my problems.
I thought about leaving my husband, but the children and I are all that he has left, and so I broke it off with Jack.
how did he take it?
he understood.
look, this has nothing to do with the fire.
it's easier to believe that, isn't it?
I don't know what AJ saw, but I know Jack Garcia and he would never do something like this to us.
baby.
because of our daughter.
and sex was never the problem.
well, you wanted to know why I never cheated on you.
what about you?
you would've known.
besides, I wanted to kill you.
I never wanted to hurt you.
I think that's what we should focus on here.
affairs make for angry spouses, right?
what could possibly make me want to burn down the Ambroses' house?
your husband was having an affair with Cheryl Ambrose.
Oh, she knew already.
he told me two weeks ago.
if you'd already told your wife, then why didn't you tell us?
I wanted to, but she
I told him not to.
it's not something I wanted to see in the papers.
look, the idea that my wife would do this is absurd.
is it?
she's still angry.
not at Cheryl Ambrose.
I knew when Jack started in front of the camera, it would be...
different.
the Jack Garcia you see on TV is not the man I married.
but marriage is about figuring out how to make it through when things change.
she was lying to herself. So, that's it?
that's it, then? People just change and then they move on?
are you saying that I'm the one that changed?
you left me.
you left.
Yeah, I left because of you.
Oh, it's my fault now?
no, I'm saying you should take a hard look at what happened before you start blaming me.
Hey, I saw what happened! I saw what was happening!
you know, I could see the doubt.
I could see the doubt when you were standing on the bloody altar!
everyone has doubts, Cal! Everyone!
at the altar, with their friends, in the maternity ward, staring at the very best thing that's ever happened to them, but that doesn't mean it's the only thing that they feel.
but you, you just...
you saw every doubt, every fear.
by the end, that was all you could see.
you couldn't let go of anything.
I was trying to be honest.
yes... I know. I know.
but I can tell you, sweetheart, there really is such a thing as too much honesty in a marriage.
so, what do you want? You'd rather be with someone who doesn't really know you, then? How about someone who doesn't need to know everything about me?
who I can surprise on his birthday.
who doesn't need to point out every time I'm even remotely attracted to another man.
someone with his head up his ass?
someone who doesn't study my eyebrows when I'm standing in a thong.
why are you here, then?
why did you hire me, eh?
it's a tough case.
doing my thing right now.
living it up, baby; that's how we do it, you know?
that Caden?
Yeah. And Little Sid and his crew at an album release party last year.
the victim, Dante Edwards, is behind him on the right.
they come up to me like, "Little Sid, please take me away from this paper wrapper!"
I'm about to put a gun in your face right now.
what's up, man?
check out the fake anger.
if his anger were real, his upper eyelids would be raised and his lips would be narrower.
the rivalry's fake?
that feud is big business.
sold a lot of albums last year.
so then why would Caden or anyone else in his crew want to kill Dante?
I'm thinking that the murderer's not in Caden's crew.
okay.
let's take a look at our victim.
which group does Dante look like, the men on the left or the men on the right?
um...
the men on the left?
Oh, you have a sixth sense.
by that, I mean you see gay people.
you think Dante's gay?
Yeah, and so do you.
all the men on the left are gay.
a new study in the Journal of Experimental Psychology showed that most people can identify gay men by face alone.
it has to do with the pattern of muscle tension in the face.
and...
check out Little Sid's newest album.
Oh.
little Sid is one big homophobe.
if he found out one of his entourage was gay, no telling what he would've done.
we're looking at the wrong rapper.
all right, take a look at these.
more drawings?
Yeah.
so what do they mean?
uh, well, here, the arsonist has a tail, and there, he's, uh, he's breathing fire.
so they're becoming more...
more elaborate.
exactly.
if it were a true memory, he'd stick to what he remembers.
but AJ's embellishing his story.
wait, so he did see Jack Garcia or he didn't?
which one is it?
well, AJ believes his story is true the same way he believes in Santa Claus.
somebody he trusts told him it was true.
it's an implanted memory.
Jack Garcia didn't start that fire.
we need to go talk to AJ's parents again.
one of them may be using their son to frame that man.
maybe you didn't leave Jack Garcia.
maybe he left you.
what? You hated him for taking away what little joy you had, didn't you? You hated him, you hated your life, so you set fire to your house, and you told your son to say it was Jack.
you think that I'd burn down my own house?
that fire killed my mother.
people have done crazier things at the end of an affair.
Cheryl was having an affair with Jack?
you had two strong motives, Mr. Ambrose:
make a bundle of money on the house and get back at the man who stole your wife.
you knew she was miserable in your marriage.
you had nothing to lose.
I had no idea that she was having an affair.
I almost left my family for Jack.
why would I want him in jail?
I had nothing to do with this.
I would never put my family at risk like that.
it wasn't Cheryl.
no.
emotion she was showing was genuine.
she's still fond of Garcia.
that's a shame.
but it'll help me make the case against Frank.
what?
he had the motive, the means and plenty of opportunity to implant the memory in his son.
no, he was truly surprised.
he... well, hang on.
Cheryl was having an affair with Jack?
see, he had no idea.
if he was surprised, it was because we knew about the affair.
Nah, you're wrong.
Oh, well, there's something you're always certain about.
you don't see what I see.
you know, you-you really used to be so charming back before you became God.
you really don't care what we think about this case, do you?
I didn't say that. Yeah, you did.
no, I didn't. I didn't. Yeah. You did.
something's off.
you split up with Roger?
Roger and I are fine.
I don't believe you, Zoe.
fine.
you want to know the truth?
Yep.
Roger proposed to me.
he wants to marry me, all right?
you just got to telling him about it now?
got to get back to the office.
have a wonderful dinner, sweetheart.
Oh, yeah.
it's gonna be a blast.
little Sid?
what up?
Whoa! Speaking of fine ladies...
Damn!
what do we have here?
easy, big guy. She's with me.
such a shame.
cause I don't talk to the po-po, baby.
guess that means you got nothing to say about Dante Edwards' murder?
I guess not.
Ooh, now there's some real anger.
you must have been pretty angry when you found out Dante was gay, huh?
Dante was a smart dude, all right?
he got the business.
he knew to keep it on the DL.
besides, I always knew which way he was swinging. Huh.
no disgust.
but your music's full of hate for gays.
look, I got records to sell.
so if I got to hate, yeah, I'm gonna hate.
but I ain't have no problem with Dante doing his Brokeback thing.
Oh, I see.
you're not homophobic, you're just an ass.
look, little po-po lady, you don't know me, all right?
and you don't know nothing about my business.
maybe not, but I do read people pretty well, and you can't seem to say Dante's name without showing anger.
look, I found this kid on the street.
I make him the hottest mixer in the game, and he go and run off with Caden?
so you had a grudge.
hell, yeah, I had a grudge.
but that's no need for gunplay, all right?
I'm a hustler, man, an entertainer.
no murderer
those guns are part of my "image."
just for show.
okay.
any idea why Dante left?
I offered the boy a raise, a new crib, but see, he didn't want none of that.
so when you two guys figure that out, then we'll have something to talk about.
Uh-uh.
Hey, Dad.
Hey. What?
are you okay?
I'm fine. Yeah.
I hate this picture.
let me see.
Oh, no, I like that one.
Why?
you and Mom spent the whole day arguing about your research trip to New Guinea.
Yeah. We were happy then.
well, look at the smiles, they're real.
well, guess it's good Mom wasn't the only one that was delusional.
thank you.
she's not wearing the ring, you know.
eh?
she's not wearing the ring.
Why?
come on, why do you think?
I mean, she's not sure about Roger.
she still thinks she's in love with you.
what?
I mean, I see what's going on with you two.
I always do.
I always have.
that's true enough.
who are you calling?
your mom.
Ugh! Get out of here!
we've got nothing else to say to you people.
we're not here for you.
Hi, Maggie.
how are you feeling, are you all right?
not so good, eh?
how long have you known about your mum and Mr. Garcia?
Oh, my God.
she's a child. Oh, she already knows.
you've known for quite some time, haven't you?
I'm tired, Daddy.
please, leave her alone.
sorry, we can't do that, Mrs. Ambrose.
did you see them together, love?
was that what happened?
it was, wasn't it?
your dad didn't know, but you did, eh?
yeah?
did you hear your parents fighting?
must have been scary.
you afraid Mr. Garcia was going to break up your family.
I heard her.
I heard my mom.
she was on the phone.
she was talking to Mr. Garcia and...
she told him... she loved him.
and that she was thinking about running away with him.
Oh, Maggie.
I thought if Mr. Garcia got blamed for the fire, they'd take him away...
...and we'd stay a family.
baby, I wasn't.
I wasn't ever going to leave you.
I was just confused.
you weren't supposed to know about any of this.
I was never going to leave you.
you burned down the house to save your family, didn't you?
you set the fire and...
and told you brother it was Mr. Garcia, right?
I told AJ to say it was Mr. Garcia.
I told him over and over until he believed it.
but that fire, it killed Nana.
I didn't start the fire.
it's okay. It's okay, sweetheart.
I swear, I didn't. I know.
it's okay, it's okay. Shh.
we love you so much.
it's okay.
mommy...
we're all together now.
nobody's going anywhere, okay?
we tell ourselves we can protect them, try to shield them.
but in the end, they see everything.
announcer This is News 7 at 11: 00. Oh, my God.
well, the FBI's just been called into this, but from what we can tell, the blaze started this morning.
and yes, we think it's maybe the same person who burned down the Ambrose house earlier this week.
the FBI is currently conducting our investigation.
FBI thinks we're looking at a serial arsonist.
are we sure the two fires are connected?
positive.
same chemical accelerant, same point of origin.
and serial arsonists don't stop, they just get bolder.
Yeah, well, this one was set in broad daylight.
that's bolder.
Yeah, we've got to find this guy.
Mr. and Mrs. Craig?
this is AUSA
she's running the investigation.
can you tell us what happened?
I was on my way to work when I got the call. I...
I came home right away.
aaron was already here.
I, uh, just gotten back from a jog.
the back of the house was all up in flames.
I tried to save what I could.
so, you lost everything? Yeah.
you can't imagine how horrible we feel.
no, I can't imagine.
we need to talk to you.
Caden's not going to talk to the cops again.
well, that's why I left them outside.
I just need five minutes.
why didn't you tell us Dante was coming to work for you?
how about, it's none of your damn business?
look, last time I was here, when I was asking you about Dante,
I expected...
anger, hate.
but all I saw was sadness.
and then I found out Dante was gay.
something you knew all along?
Yeah, I thought so.
I think I know why he left Little Sid to come work for you.
okay, lady, you're out of line. Am I?
CADEN, what exactly was your relationship with Dante Edwards?
that's enough, all right?
why were you guys arguing at the club the night he was killed?
you're not just gonna... like this.
was it 'cause he was threatening to come out?
cause he was threatening to take you with him?
okay, you know what? Is that why you killed him?
you don't know what you're talking about.
I had nothing to do with Dante's death.
you didn't, did you?
you really did care for him, huh?
you loved him.
you know they buried him today?
and I couldn't even go to the funeral.
whoa...
...those are some pretty strong feelings.
contempt.
disgust.
is that true, B?
is that how you felt about us?
well...
I told you before.
I thought the relationship was unwise.
where you were the night of Dante Edwards' murder?
I was here watching the game, like I told you before.
that's a lie.
cay, would you tell her?
cay, would you tell this woman?
what you want me to tell her?
that you were here with me?
cause you wasn't.
where were you, B?
it was only a matter...
where the hell were you, B?!
...before... someone outed you two.
we built this together
me and you.
I was protecting us.
protecting us?
what? You forgot?
cuz, come on, man.
what it was like coming from nothing?
this house, the cars.
you don't get any of this if they know the truth about you.
I would've had Dante.
he would still be alive.
I have no idea who Frank Ambrose is.
why would I burn down his house?
I don't know. Maybe you like starting fires.
look, you have the wrong guy.
I didn't burn down anything.
what? You certainly got a kick out of seeing your house in ashes.
you can't imagine how horrible we feel.
you could barely contain yourself.
laurel and I- our marriage is over.
we wanted to split up for months, but we were stuck in that house.
you couldn't sell it?
the value of the house had tanked.
we couldn't afford to sell it, but now, with the insurance payout, we can both go our separate ways.
frankly, it's a relief.
do you believe him?
Yeah, but I got a question for you.
is your wife cheating on you?
well, uh, we both had our share of indiscretions.
that's a yes, then?
who's your favorite TV reporter?
hmm?
this one
Yes, Jim, they do think that this fire was started by the same serial arsonist, and the FBI...
Mr. Garcia?
busy day?
as you can see behind me, the fire's been brought under control, and they want everyone in the neighborhood to know that you're safe, and you can stay in your homes...
just doing my job.
you didn't stay around to interview the victims.
I thought you were Mr. Human Interest Guy.
of course, interviewing another lover whose house is in ruins could be a little awkward, right?
I don't know what you're talking about.
that's a lie.
so, what is it?
you feed your ego by having sex with married women, and then, when they grow tired of you, you burn down their houses?
I had nothing to do with either of those fires.
but you were having sex with Laurel Craig.
Yeah, I thought so.
see, the thing is, I believe you.
I don't think you started either one of those fires.
how long have you known about Laurel Craig?
must have made you feel powerless. Excuse me?
arson's about power.
and in female arsonists, it's about revenge.
you're afraid that's true, aren't you?
right?
we have the FBI searching your home right now.
tell 'em, Sarah. Tell 'em it's not true.
I looked at all the numbers in your phone.
I looked at your e-mail.
you planned a vacation with Laurel.
you took Cheryl to a benefit.
honey, I...
don't!
you humiliated me.
you and those women took everything from me.
so you took everything from them.
Hey.
Hey.
heard you did all right.
Yeah.
Yeah, we did, actually. It was okay.
Torres did, too, on the drive-by with a little help from Loker.
how did it go with Zoe?
it's good, actually.
Yeah.
Roger's proposed to her.
you okay?
you know what I miss?
I miss the arguments.
you do?
what?
probably not the best time to tell her, though.
absolutely not.
thanks for your help on this.
my office is grateful.
your office is welcome.
we're not a total disaster together.
what?
I mean, working together.
Oh. And I know.
I should've told you about Roger.
it's just... I don't know.
I guess it just never seemed like the right time...
no. Hey, so, if, um, Roger makes you happy, right, then we'll make it work.
for Emily, I mean.
Yeah. Thanks.
you should probably wear the ring, though.
Oh. It's a little confusing.
okay.
all right, then.
Bye.
what was that?
mom, I'm home.
six whole minutes before curfew aren't you proud of me?
that would be our daughter.
Oops.
the following story is fictional and does not depier any actual person or event
Dr. Lightman, the guys from Homeland Security are here.
they want your assessment of the new handheld polygraph.
I'll be right there.
do you work at the Department of Homeland Security?
Yes.
do you have black hair? Yes.
see, the handheld measures cardio and galvanic skin response.
it's the only polygraph ever developed with this kind of portability.
Oh, not quite.
uh, Cal, you know Secretary Miller from Homeland Security.
good to see you.
and this is Tom Whitmore, the new TSA deputy.
uh... what the hell is this?
it's a lie detector.
the West Africans used them first.
when you're on trial, you held the egg in your hands, and if it broke, it's a sign of anxiety.
you were found guilty.
well, I'd say our handheld's a little more advanced.
well, unfortunately, both devices suffer from the same problem.
uh, Ms. Cooper, would you mind?
may I?
light: Could you ask the control questions again, please?
what are you doing?
Hi.
do you work at the Department of Homeland Security?
uh, yes.
do you have black hair?
Yes.
the problem with all polygraph tests is false positives.
innocent people can fail if they feel an increase in any emotion
anger, fear, sexual arousal.
not just guilt.
your polygraph is no better than the egg at telling us which emotion it's responding to.
no.
I've been wanting to try that for years.
see, you would have been found guilty, but you were just angry.
you should be, uh, spending your money studying the face.
43 muscles combine to produce a possibility of 10, 000 expressions.
now, if you learn them all, you don't need a polygraph.
how much did we spend on this damn project anyway?
uh, not much.
I'm sure we can recoup most of our costs.
now, that was lovely.
what?
a gestural retreat.
what's that?
his step backwards.
means he doesn't believe a word he just said.
he's lying.
well, I'm not a crook.
I've earned everything I've got.
what do you see?
I see a skeptical, emotionally distant scientist obsessing over facial twitches.
why are you doing micro expression training?
well, I got it set at triple speed.
you know, when you try and hide your emotions, they leak out at a fifth of a second?
well, this is testing me at a 15th of a second.
impressive.
you know who else is impressive on that thing? Is this another attempt to get me to take Ms. Torres under my wing?
you need somebody to back you on the military case.
I got you for that.
I'll be courtside with Earl White.
it's a freshman shooting guard, hottest NBA prospect in the country.
college Athletic Association wants us to find out if he took a bribe to play for GWCU.
well, we got a meeting at Fort Meade in half an hour.
look, I'll... I'll meet you there later, okay, but let's get Torres involved.
she's a natural.
she's got phenomenal instincts.
doesn't mean she knows the science.
Dr. Foster said you wanted to see me?
what do you see?
anger.
fear.
sadness.
let's go.
specialist Sheila Lake has served with the 23rd Mountain Division for three years, two of those in Afghanistan.
lake is asserting that she was raped by her platoon leader,
staff Sergeant Russell Scott.
we'd like you to find out if the allegation's true.
grab your gear and report to the staff judge advocate.
is Sergeant Scott being court-martialed?
we're not there yet.
sergeant Scott's leadership is crucial to the tribal intelligence missions we're running on the Pakistani border.
we start a court- martial proceeding, he'll be off the line for six months.
then, I'm afraid we can't help you.
excuse me?
hire us when you want the truth.
waste taxpayers' money if that's not what you're after?
Dr. Lightman, my first concern is the safety of every woman in that platoon.
that's why we're investigating.
but Sergeant Scott passed a polygraph.
Yeah, well, I bet his grandmother didn't think he did it, either.
that's equally reliable.
look, Sergeant Scott's set to redeploy in three days.
he's the only commander who can recognize hostiles on that border.
without him, the mission's more dangerous for every soldier in the 23rd.
I certainly can't have a rapist in charge of the females in that platoon, but if I'm going to pull Sergeant Scott off the line,
I need to know this woman is telling the truth.
six-five, moves like he's five-one.
could dunk at ten, won the state championship at 14.
national high school player of the year the last three years.
I would not have pegged you for a hoops geek.
you know the fifth-grade boy with the vintage Dr. J poster and the instant recall of his career stats?
I was that boy.
Dr. Foster?
I'm Jeremy Levine with the Athletic Association.
thanks for coming down.
who doesn't enjoy a day watching Earl White do his thing?
Howard Taft certainly does.
he's the alumni booster who allegedly paid Earl $50, 000 to come and play for Carver.
we'd like to investigate this quietly.
Earl's a good kid.
he lost his mom last year.
he's raising his brother on his own.
Plus, he's gonna go pro this spring, and you don't want any more bad press for the "one and done" rule.
making kids go to college for a year before they turn pro forces them to take high school more seriously.
it also forces young superstars to play a year of college ball, jacking up ratings and revenues.
Loker here has a hard time with half-truths.
you hungry? Huh? Huh?
Earl White, Dr. Gillian Foster and her associate, Eli Loker.
you folks are the lie guys, right?
more the truth guys, but it depends on the case.
do you have some time to chat?
you know, I have to take my little brother home, and I got an Econ midterm tomorrow.
need to get with the books, you know?
but hit my cell later.
anything I can do to clear my name.
appreciate it.
any quick reads?
his speech was hurried, and he brought that basketball to his chest, creating a barrier between us.
those are both signs of anxiety.
well, that's something any college athlete might feel when he's been accused of taking a bribe.
we're not magicians.
we're scientists.
we'll need to talk to Earl and the booster to spot any conclusive signs of lying.
I'm not naive, okay?
when you sign up to be one of four women in a platoon of 30 guys, guys who aren't gonna see another woman for six months, well... like they say in Girl Scouts, "Be prepared."
so, you were harassed?
porn in the latrines...
Jody calls.
Jody calls?
I taught that bitch her left then right. Nailed her ass. Then left last night. Got it.
Yeah.
did Staff Sergeant Scott participate in any of this?
he didn't make jokes or anything, but...
Oh, his hands were everywhere.
he liked to walk in on us while we were changing, if we were in the showers.
tell us about the attack.
I was, uh... I was on my way back from a workout.
ran into him behind the mess.
and he ordered me to strip.
he grabbed me.
he pinned me down.
and he assaulted me.
I was sexually assaulted.
Hey, what's up with the mime act?
light: You ask the questions, I observe.
Dr. Lightman finds asking questions distracting.
he prefers to watch.
you finish the psych profile on the guy she's accused?
nice to see you, too.
what's his problem?
friendly fire.
collateral damage.
you can start with the lies in the language.
bet they're not gonna end there.
last Tuesday?
I went to dinner.
I had a few drinks at the NCO Club.
I stopped by the PX, and then headed back to the barracks.
tell me again-- start with drinks.
drinks, PX, barracks.
toothpaste and deodorant.
I have the receipt.
you weren't anywhere near the mess hall?
I just said I wasn't.
and you're telling me you didn't attack Specialist Lake?
that's exactly what I'm saying, and while we're on the subject... LIGHT: Okay.
that's good.
thanks for your time.
Hey, you.
whoa, quite a bicep you have there.
you must really love the weight room, huh?
I don't normally mix business with pleasure, but...
and I was wondering you fancy grabbing a drink later or...?
uh, I'm not gay.
and isn't this a little inappropriate?
Absolutely.
sorry.
right.
excuse me.
what the hell was that? I love a man in uniform, you know?
the rape was unplanned, one time, with no additional violence.
that suggests a power assertive rapist, somebody who is obsessed with masculinity, who needs others to see him as a man.
if Sergeant Scott fit the profile, he would have reacted to my overture with one emotion-- disgust.
there was no disgust, just surprise.
Correct-- eyebrows up, jaw down.
okay, but... the guy was totally amped up.
Yeah, but he showed no deception leakage, right, no sign of lying.
he looked like he wanted to throw me across the room.
a man charged with rape is even more likely to be angry if he's innocent.
well, they can't both be telling the truth.
they're not.
Sheila Lake made two mouth shrugs when she was describing the rape.
that's a classic gestural slip.
it means she has no confidence in her words.
the woman was lying.
I was sexually assaulted.
you really think a woman would lie about rape?
unpleasant truths, human mortality, a moustache on a woman
three things we'd all prefer to ignore.
FBI crime reports have found that eight percent of rape allegations are false.
okay, but the army vets I worked with at TSA said that sexual assault was a big problem.
it doesn't explain the gestural slip.
lake's also not exhibiting any of the emotions a rape victim typically displays when recounting her story.
no shame... no fear.
we should be seeing a lot of activity in the forehead, but there isn't any.
maybe she's got post-traumatic stress.
emotional numbing might explain her inability to express her feelings...
but not the mouth shrug.
look, I'm telling you, there's something off about Sergeant Scott.
you know, I once had actors play out the testimony from a rape case in front of 30 federal judges.
and you know the biggest predictor of whether they believed the man or the woman?
the gender of the judge.
you think I'm saying he's guilty 'cause I'm a woman?
me, Darwin, and 2, 000 years of evolutionary biology.
well, I think what Dr. Lightman is trying to say is that it's important not to let what you bring in the room affect what you see in the room.
Dr. Lightman?
what is it?
harassment report.
the platoon's equal opportunity rep just sent it over.
looks like it was filed anonymously last fall.
it alleges Sergeant Scott surprised women in the showers and entered their barracks unannounced.
hmm, backs up Lake's story.
you know, generally it's not a good idea to call your boss an idiot.
I didn't say you were an idi...
but your buccinator did.
that's not... Oh, that's a pretty impressive combination of contempt and disgust.
I'm... I'm s... I...
apology accepted.
head back to Fort Meade and check into the personnel files of the woman and the sergeant.
and hang in there.
you should consider going a little easier on Torres.
light: Why?
she's all false positives.
see, that's the trouble with naturals.
they don't see what's missing.
they're all instinct and no science.
I'll have a falafel sandwich, please.
an Italian ice.
grape.
you wash your hands today?
uh, yeah, of course.
do you have any kind of pain in your neck?
uh, no. Why?
people touch it when they lie.
it's a classic manipulator.
you been to the bathroom today?
uh, no.
Oh, great.
anybody else want a side of feces?
anybody?!
side of feces?!
if an alum took me here,
I would want to play hoops for Carver.
I bet it made an impression on Earl White.
why is it guys named White are always black and guys named Black are always white?
am I going to be sorry you're here?
Barry White, Jack Black.
does your radical honesty pledge mean you have to say everything you think?
it's the only way to be truly honest.
let's turn it off while we're working, shall we?
now, what do we know about the booster?
uh, Howard Taft, forty-five, made his money on Internet job boards, led the funding campaign for Carver's new athletic center.
apparently he likes giving back.
Mr. Taft, thanks for agreeing to talk with us.
always a pleasure to talk Carver basketball, Dr. Foster.
Hey.
Oh, championship ring. Sweet.
must have cost a fortune online.
actually, I, uh, I earned it riding the pine for the '86 team.
what's that?
it's a, uh, voice stress analyzer.
it measures pitch and gauges anxiety.
we find it's less about what you say than how you say it.
now, tell us about your relationship with Earl White.
he ordered me to strip.
he grabbed me...
Oh, sorry.
these are Specialist Lake's platoon mates.
Hi.
thanks for coming in.
I want to conduct individual interviews, so if you could come with me, you two stay here.
Thanks, Heidi.
...pinned me down.
and he assaulted me.
I was sexually assaulted.
you finish the vocal stress analysis on Taft?
Yeah.
check it out.
Hey. Oh, championship ring.
sweet. Must have cost a fortune online.
actually, I... I earned it riding the pine for the '86 team.
typical vocal stress on a typical question.
that's Taft's vocal stress baseline.
and given how irritating most people find you...
it's a high tolerance baseline.
he'd have to be extremely anxious for his pitch to spike above it, so...
applying the baseline...
you can see from the spikes that Taft had three moments of extreme anxiety.
let me guess.
that's when he denied bribing our basketball phenom.
Yep. Indistinguishable to the ear, but...
and, no, I didn't bribe Earl White.
really, I didn't give Earl a penny.
a bribe?
I barely know the kid.
thanks to the technology, we can see the stress in Taft's voice.
the data suggests young Mr. White just came into a lot of money.
but we've seen no uptick in Earl's spending habits.
I talked to his friends.
the guy's got no bling, he lives in a walk-up with his brother, he takes the bus... Earl's got a big payday coming as soon as he turns pro.
why take Taft's money if he's not going to spend it?
the psychology's inconsistent.
we need to get inside Earl's head.
you want me to pull recent interview footage, see if he leaks anything when he talks about playing for Carver?
Yeah.
what's that last sound wave?
always a pleasure to talk Carver basketball, Dr. Foster.
that is when Taft met you.
see how the graph is all scrunched up?
it indicates arousal.
apparently the pine was not the only thing our aging jock wanted to ride.
Hey, can I...?
please.
staff Sergeant Scott has a past.
he has a criminal record?
a long one.
I thought you couldn't get into the army with a record.
you can't, unless they grant you what's called a moral waiver.
it used to be just for misdemeanors, but the army is so stretched for recruits that they're using them to let felons in.
moral waiver.
the army really has a way with words.
uh, Sergeant Scott was arrested for possession, arson, assault and battery...
he has an arson conviction?
he was 16, but the assault's more recent.
no, i-it's the arson that's significant.
arson and rape have an unusually high correlation.
they're both crimes about the assertion of power.
so with the arson conviction...
Yeah.
it makes the rape a lot more likely.
we're seeing promising indicators in the Pentium chip market.
Techspring earnings should be strong as ever.
Hey, boss. Call my broker, have him dump all my holdings in Techspring.
okay. And, uh, I just spoke with Major Harris' office.
I told them you were on your way.
look at that hand shrug.
it's not a good time to be investing in Techspring.
we need to talk about Sergeant Scott.
Oh. This is classified.
how'd you get it?
the same way you would have.
given the correlation between arson and rape...
well, it's interesting, but it's irrelevant, I'm afraid.
turns out Lake's platoon mates had rather a lot to say.
Heidi said they wouldn't talk about the rape.
well, I didn't bring them in to hear them talk.
I brought them in to watch them listen.
they turned the video back on, huh? - Yep.
it's human nature.
they always flip the switch.
Hey, Natural.
what do you see?
nothing.
I don't see anything.
exactly.
I don't understand.
well, look.
the absence of emotion is...
just as important as the presence of emotion.
now, you, you need to learn that.
when women listen to a rape victim they believe, they reflect certain emotions.
they blush, avert their eyes, hunch their shoulders.
these women exhibit none of that.
they're not showing any reflectors.
so they don't believe her.
that doesn't prove anything.
lake lived with those women for three years and neither one of them is reacting.
they know this rape never happened.
light: You made a false accusation against your sergeant.
that's a crime.
and then there's the other women in your platoon.
you know, we have MPs standing by.
if your friends helped you plan this, they're as guilty as you are, right?
they know you're lying, don't they?
thought so.
have the MPs arrest her platoon mates.
they're all in on it.
No!
look, they had noth... They had nothing to do with it.
it was my idea.
sergeant Scott didn't rape you?
no.
he didn't.
take Specialist Lake into custody.
how could you do this?
you know how hard it is for women in the military.
the army has just started to take these claims seriously.
there are victims out there who need help.
a lot of them.
you should be ashamed of yourself.
ashamed?
I may have lied, but I was doing the right thing.
okay, I was trying to protect my platoon.
I was doing the right thing.
I was doing the right thing!
ladies, if you could, uh, wait in there, I will be taking you in one at a time.
playing out your favorite fantasies, Loker?
studying the psychological influence of uniforms on credibility.
Lightman wanted to see how they affect people's ability to spot lies.
women in uniform?
I do love my work.
how's it going with Lightman?
uh, he's not my biggest fan.
well, that's just 'cause you're uneducated.
excuse me?
well, you're a natural.
the few naturals Lightman's come across have one thing in common.
no college degree.
you haven't been asked to focus on verbal skills?
you're saying I can't learn the science.
I'm saying you didn't have to.
that's got to be irritating for a guy who's spent two decades trying to see what you were born seeing.
Thanks.
that's very un-Loker of you.
I've never been with a Latina woman.
don't push it.
how's it going with the ballplayer?
ballplayers play baseball.
Yeah. Chicken dumpling?
Oh, no. Never eat meat I can't see.
no. Really.
no. You have no idea what's in there.
take a look at this.
Earl White just took state for the third time.
the kid's on the list of every NBA scout in the country, but when asked about playing pro ball...
chin thrust. He's angry.
very. Earl White should be on top of the world.
why is he secretly angry?
I spot the liars.
you're the feelings department.
follow me.
I got something for you.
okay, would you lie to right a wrong?
depends. Why?
lake lied, but then said she was protecting her platoon.
I'm doing the right thing.
she said it with conviction, and with no deception leakage.
how does accusing your commander of rape protect the platoon?
that's what I asked myself.
okay, these are the individual interviews with her platoon mates.
watch what happens when they discuss Sergeant Scott.
sergeant Scott is a strong leader.
I'm glad Sergeant Scott's in command.
concealed disgust.
Yup. Looks the same every time.
they know he didn't rape Sheila Lake, but they feel intense disgust for him.
made me think.
what if Sheila Lake didn't lie about everything?
what if she lied about the victim, but not the crime?
so, you think
sergeant Scott raped someone else in the platoon?
the harassment report, arson conviction
both consistent with the profile of a rapist, right?
what if the real victim is too scared to come forward?
so Lake accuses Sergeant Scott to right a past wrong, and to protect the other women in the platoon.
