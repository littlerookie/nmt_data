but the row could hinder its attempt to be granted visa-free travel within the schengen area of 25 european countries.
but the row has at least ensured that the question of openness in the cloud has received a lot of attention, observes bob sutor, ibm's point man for standards: "people have been put on notice that they can get locked into a cloud."
but the row has deeper roots. It is about the new fault-line in the politics of multiculturalism: religion.

but the rudd center study finds that teens move on to the regular menu-and purchase meals that have as much as 1100 calories. That's roughly half of their recommended total daily calories
but the rufous hummingbird migrates the longest distance, from mexico to alaska and back, totaling 5000 miles.
but the rug has eight divots that line up perfectly with that desk.
but the rug in our bedroom had some serious mileage on it.
but the rug's been pulled here, DeShawn.

but the rule for the survival of criminal organizations...
but the rule is needed, says mr batista, to promote industrial development.
but the rule is not hard and fast.
but the rule is we can never repeat a cut.
but the rule of law means more than holding other commercial parties to account; it means holding the government to account.
but the ruler will be seated there to take his food before the lord; he will go in by the covered way to the door, and will come out by the same way.

but the rules are clear.
but the rules are just different in our house.

but the ruling does not necessarily contradict ms giles's findings, since it merely concluded that the three documents were not among those she found to be forged.
but the ruling in a wto case decided this week suggests that the world trade body could be an effective tool for resolving this problem.
but the ruling is likely to boost proview in its attempts to fight apple on all fronts.
but the ruling is nonetheless a blow for the competition watchdog and a boon for the lenders.
but the ruling is not as broad as apple had hoped, and the import ban doesn't take effect until april, giving htc--and google (goog), whose software the phones were running--time to fashion a workaround.
but the ruling panhellenic socialist movement believes that the new government to power at least february next year, to be considered after the debt crisis situation is stable election.
but the ruling party is not going gracefully.
