I don't wanna commandeer your kitchen.
Oh, please. Someone should.
they made those construction paper turkeys at Zola's school, and she had no idea what they were talking about.
you'd make me look like a better mother.
think about it.
pancreatic tumor. Gotta go.
Thanks. - Welcome.
do you have Donna's pre-op labs?
in process.
I'm gonna go examine Dr. Webber.
and when I get back, we're gonna get started on the printer.
is that okay with you?
Yeah.
what was that about?
Alex told me. Ballsy.
stupid.
did Kepner invite you to her wedding? - No.
so she didn't ask you for your address?
no, but I'm sure Alex is invited.
I'm probably the plus one.
Hey, Dr. Yang needs the printer again today.
uh, no. - One day. Tell Grey we're sorry.
no, you... you tell her. - Can't.
gotta get the printer going so we only take one day - away from you, not two. - Shane...
dying baby waiting on a part. - No...
get back here! - I'm a waste of a bed.
your stress test was a disaster.
you want me to dwell on all your past failures?
I'm a different man than I was last week.
I exercise.
I don't know why you don't think about going into a rehab facility.
we can get you in there even if you don't pass.
look, I don't want to go to a facility.
it's bad enough I'm here...
where everyone knows me... and has to be nice.
well, you can't go home alone.
I'll get a home health aide.
I'll have Wilson run another stress test.
you watch. Flying colors.
you know, if you get out of here in time, you can have Thanksgiving dinner at our house if you and Catherine don't have plans.
you cookin'?
is that so preposterous?
you want a straight answer?
no, Owen's girlfriend is cooking.
does she put mushrooms in her stuffing?
I find it makes it soggy.
Hey. You done already?
no, she was too edematous.
we packed her and put in a temporary closure.
you can do her femur tomorrow after we close.
okay.
I wanna talk to you about something.
I was with someone when we were apart.
I don't think that it was completely out-of-bounds.
we were separated, and you'd kicked me out of the house.
Oh, so it's my fault?
there are no faults. I just... feel like you should know.
we're starting fresh, and...
I wanna be honest with you. I...
I shouldn't have said anything.
no, no.
I'm sorry. You're right.
thank you for...
being so very honest.
I'm trying.
is there anything that you wanna ask me?
I don't know. Was it.
was it once?
it was more than once.
more than twice?
more than ten? You know what? I don't...
I don't wanna know anything about it.
I'm sorry.
is it over?
Yes. Completely.
okay.
that's all I need to know.
you didn't? - What?
cheat on you?
get involved with anyone.
I got involved with myself.
I... danced in my underwear, and I tried to remember that I used to be a person who had fun.
I'm really trying. Callie, please...
tell me that you're trying, too.
I am.
can I hug you?
Yeah.
I really missed you.
me, too.
sorry.
uh... Ella's thigh is really swollen.
she's hypotensive.
all right, we gotta get her back in the O. R.
and, uh, do the femur right now.
um... are... you gonna help me?
sure. Will you give the family an update?
they're on a...
plane.
it's just the babysitter.
Dr. Grey.
I have to stop in post-ops.
tell Wilson to run a stress test on Dr. Webber...
they need the printer today... Dr. Yang.
what? No. Sorry.
they said it's not up for discussion.
they're already running it.
I mean, I tried to talk to Ross, but he said Dr. Yang isn't even interested in having...
nurses' station. - We need to talk.
we really don't. - No, we do.
I have to wrap up a patient in the E. R. back here in 15?
okay. - Yes. Great.
Dr. Hunt?
Hey, so I invited Dr. Webber to Thanksgiving, so now it really has to happen.
his lady is cooking Thanksgiving dinner at our house.
Oh, that's nice. - Should we invite more people?
well, uh, if we're making a whole turkey, we can... we can invite a few more.
okay, let's get Dr. Yang here, please.
you and Bailey can come. - We're going to my family, assuming she's still speaking to me by then.
we should probably invite Callie.
I'm sure with the trial, I'm sure she didn't have time - to make plans. - So we're not inviting Arizona. We can't have both.
well, they're back together, so...
they are? - Hey, can you go do your thing - so we can get to our thing? - Yes.
so we're not inviting Yang, right? Because that wouldn't be...
uh, she probably has plans.
no, she probably doesn't.
do you have Thanksgiving plans?
what do you think? - My house. 3: 00.
all right, I'm bringing Jo. - I figured.
don't sound so excited.
you know, you were an intern balling an attending once.
you kiss my kids with that mouth?
I got a pre-op. It'll be fast, but do not start with Hunt until I get back.
I won't. - Thank you.
you don't wanna know.
I called Dr. Yang. She's not available right now.
does she know it's me who's asking for her? - Yes.
you okay?
sure. I'm going to update a patient's babysitter instead of doing surgery.
because Torres and Robbins don't need me.
they have each other. - Are the two of you...
they're getting back together.
were you really into her or was it...
I was really into her. Why do I do this?
I can't keep falling apart at work every time I get dumped.
it's starting to be all the time.
so get off the floor. Go talk to your babysitter and get back in the O. R. like a surgeon would do.
Hey. - Oh, my vascular graft...
Yeah, the one you printed? I was gonna come and see it.
it had a glitch, so it'll be tomorrow, hopefully.
not today. - Okay.
Hey, you, uh, you have Thanksgiving plans?
well, I'll probably pick up an extra shift. You know?
I don't get all that worked up about Cranberries.
you?
um... well, uh, it's, um...
evolving.
you can tell me you're spending it with Emma.
I won't melt if I hear her name.
Yes. I'll be with Emma.
she gonna cook?
hmm. Well, watch out.
you let her make a turkey for just the two of you, you're gonna be eating leftovers for the rest of your life.
her... femur was bleeding very heavily into her thigh, and... she was in danger of losing too much blood.
Oh, my God.
they've taken her back into the O. R. and they're working on her right now.
you told me it was just a broken leg.
well, a femur break can be complicated, but we're gonna take care of it.
Oh, my God. They are gonna kill me.
I'm sure that they won't.
I really liked them, too.
they work together. They're in Alaska, studying the nesting habits of eagles.
I cannot believe I'm gonna lose this job.
they're not gonna fire you.
they'll understand it wasn't your fault.
something terrible happened. You have to blame somebody.
what, are they gonna blame their child?
they're probably never gonna let me see her again.
I guess it's my fault for getting so attached.
Hey, can I boot you out of your O. R. at 4: 00?
uh, the mastoidectomy after this? - Yeah.
I need to put a gastro-j on the schedule, and if I tell Grey she can't get into the O. R. until 7: 00, she's gonna shove her hand into my chest and rip out my heart with her claws.
that means I have to work late.
you'll be working late anyhow, because you're so committed to the welfare of this hospital.
and to the people who count on you for support.
all right, all right, I will take it.
thank you.
and Kepner invited me to her wedding.
did she?
plus one.
and you're gonna be invited... plus one.
is she, like, expecting us to bring other people?
no, brides are weird. Go think about something else.
please?
okay.
is he gonna make it?
well, if Yang can get her act together.
I keep diuresing him, but that's not gonna work for much longer.
Hey, you're invited to Mer's for Thanksgiving.
Really?
I'm invited and, uh, I'm bringing you.
the attendings are gonna be weird if I'm there.
no, they're not.
just go without me. We'll meet up after.
you think I wanna be there if you're not?
you're sweet.
okay, screw it.
how about we get takeout chicken and eat it in the car
I think I love you.
Yeah, yeah, settle down.
two more women responded to the ad.
one of them's gonna come by in about half an hour.
did she seem nice?
Yeah.
I told Stan.
what? Why?
I couldn't let it go, and he...
Oh! He'll hate this.
it was supposed to seem natural, like someone you'd met at the pool.
I can't lie to him.
we've always been honest. That's how it's worked.
this isn't some big lie.
it's a kindness. You agreed.
well, that was before...
before I was dying?
it matters more now, not less.
so you're saying she performed unnecessary procedures?
I'm not saying anything.
I was shooting the breeze with a friend,
I wasn't making a report to the board.
I'm sorry.
whatever. Let's just reel it back in.
you know he can't do that, and I certainly can't.
but she's gonna handle it.
that is not what you said.
you said you saw the Virgin Mary in your toothpaste.
we were talking.
I need to pull her off the floor, at least until this is under control.
she was gonna go...
I'm sorry.
can you let me talk to her?
Yeah.
she seems nice, right?
Oh, the woman? - Yeah.
Oh, I... I don't know. I...
okay, I tried to check her out, but I just... there wasn't a good enough reason for me to stay in the room.
it is strange. There's no question.
my wife and I looking for a female companion for her lover.
Yeah, it's a first for me.
eh, you're young.
uh, Donna and I had a wonderful marriage for 30 years.
and then the fire went away.
and we both found other people.
but she was still my best friend.
we somehow both hated the idea of divorcing each other.
so now you're helping her pick somebody for...
he... he's never been in love like this before.
she's afraid he's gonna be alone forever.
he's... he's a wonderful person.
we... we played golf together for years.
I don't want to see him alone either.
you told the chief of surgery that I have a psychiatric condition?
it was an accident.
Derek and I were talking... - Where the hell do you get...
all we're talking about is a few days.
take a break! Figure out how to manage this.
stay out of my...
bench yourself, or the chief will.
you send your lackey to tell my lackey?
you can't tell me to my face you're destroying my study?
you know I'm not destroying your study...
if I don't finish this phase by the end of this week, I lose my funding.
come with me.
please.
that's Nathan. He's a real baby.
we're not talking about me. We're talking about him.
that's Ashley, his mom. He has a very nice father.
this isn't a study, Meredith. This is a baby.
Nathan is the first one in his family who's supposed to go to college.
I mean, he's a baby.
have you lost your mind?
do you think that because I have kids, every time I see a child, I'm gonna start lactating - and lose my ability to reason? - No, I...
you wanted to do something flashy with the equipment. It didn't work.
now you want me to shut down my entire study, so that you can run a hail mary that very well might kill this very cute child.
baby Nathan and all of his college potential, - can get an artificial graft... - No.
like every other H. L.H. S. baby...
no, he can't.
because you can't make it work.
how many people?
we might be up to 16.
but some of them are kids, and they barely eat.
I thought this was dinner for four.
I know. I'm sorry.
it just kinda got out of hand.
we can all just cook together.
I thought Meredith doesn't know how to turn on an oven.
well, the rest of us.
I'll do all the shopping. I'll do all the planning.
I will do everything, and you just get to shout out orders.
okay, it's starting to sound better. - Okay.
good.
so... maybe I should quit while I'm ahead but, um...
what?
she doesn't have Thanksgiving plans.
I mean, just as a friend...
I, uh...
you know, I shouldn't have said anything. Just forget it.
no, Owen. It's okay.
if you say you're over her, I believe you.
and really, it's up to Meredith and Derek 'cause it's their house.
are you sure?
you know, I want you to be comfortable.
well, I'm gonna be cooking for what could be, at the end of the day, 30 people, so...
I won't have time to be uncomfortable.
okay.
you know, I'm gonna speak to her about the stuffing.
you think she could handle a deep fried turkey?
I mean, there's nothing like it.
don't people kill themselves trying to make those?
everything has a price.
you guys, my patient has a husband and a lover.
and she and the husband are interviewing women for the lover to date when she's dead.
when the patient's dead? - It's weird.
is that like a threesome thing?
Dr. Webber!
I'm just asking a question.
you hiding from Grey again?
on your way, Edwards.
I need you to take over Bailey's surgical load today.
I can't. My study is falling apart, and I have a palliative surgery later today. I...
you ever done an ex-fix before, Murphy?
no.
hmm. Try it.
Yeah. Right there.
now the first cortex is hard.
then it'll feel spongy in the middle, and then hard again when you hit the second cortex, okay?
that's it.
really push through.
uh, okay. It feels spongy.
okay, ease up a bit now.
now the pitch'll change when you hit the cortex, okay?
can you hear it?
Oh, my God.
okay, you drilled right through her leg into the table. - Oh, my God!
no, it's... back it up. Just put the drill in reverse.
I... I can't... - Put the drill in reverse!
I can't find the... can you just take it?
my hand is shaking. - Okay, all right.
pull it together... - Can you please just...
Murphy, pull it together.
Oh, please!
Murphy! - Can you please do something?
Callie, can you take it yourself?
just give her a few minutes to calm down.
it was her?
Ten-plus times! That was her?
that is just...
perfect.
why would you tell her?
I didn't. I... I... I... I told her it was someone.
I didn't say who. I mean, listen, she figured it out because you fell apart in there.
you could've just forgotten about it and gone on with your happy life.
this is my marriage we're talking about.
Yeah, and it's my career! She hates me now. - No, she doesn't.
Oh, please. Of course she does.
she can't blame you. She loves you.
the only one she can blame is me.
so you realize that Stephanie and I are serious, right? You get that?
Yeah, yeah. - Uh-huh, great.
I think it's nice that you guys are, you know...
whatever you are.
right, so...
so why is it that you invited her to your wedding plus a guest and you're gonna invite me plus a guest? What's going on?
right, yeah. Um, I wanted to talk to you about that.
you are actually not getting an invitation, but Stephanie is, so you could just be her plus one.
look, I put your name on the invite list.
your name is Avery. We don't know any other A's.
you're literally the top of the list, first thing we see when we look at it.
I just...
I didn't wanna... rub it in Matthew's face.
because of me.
because... you're my friend and I want you to be there.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I wanna be there, too, but...
come on...
Jackson, I can't go through with this if I don't have your blessing.
well, you have it.
all right, but...
I don't think I should be there.
Dr. Grey was pulled into an emergency surgery.
so we are gonna have to push Mrs. Kaufman's procedure - to tomorrow. I... - What is she doing?
I apologize. I'll be over here.
you don't have to actually date the woman she chooses.
I don't wanna date any woman!
that's why she's doing this, Stan.
I thought you were gonna talk her out of it.
you need to tell her yourself.
you're both putting me in the middle.
because she listens to you.
she doesn't listen to anyone!
besides, this is not such a terrible idea.
I'm not a child she has to arrange daycare for!
a bunch of women she scared up on the Internet?
this is... it's awful.
it's taking her mind off what's actually happening.
that can't be the worst thing in the world.
she thinks she can find someone to replace her?
you can't... replace her.
nobody can possibly replace... her.
Why?
why is this happening?
he's desatted to 60.
if we're gonna do this thing, we gotta do it now.
I can't. I don't have a conduit to put in him.
it won't be done for another six hours.
I don't know if he's gonna last that long. - Okay.
okay, let's put him on an oscillator.
it will stabilize his sats for easily a day.
I don't wanna wait a day, Cristina.
no, neither do I, Alex.
but in the long run, it's still his best chance.
okay.
what?
drive me around the block before my battery dies.
Ah. You gonna do it?
Shane? No.
it'll be like having sex with a baby seal.
SATs are better.
good.
why don't you talk to Meredith?
explain that everything is gonna be fine.
maybe she'll cut me some slack.
she's got a point. - Which is what?
you could put in an artificial graft.
we tried. He rejected it.
so try again.
pump him full of meds, hold him over for a couple years...
you wanna fight a different battle, - that's your own problem. - You know, you're right, Alex.
this is my problem.
your heart rate's pretty high.
keep going. I'm fine.
this is when we're supposed to take it up a notch.
but I'm not sure... - Wilson, I'm gonna hurt you.
Dr. Webber, I don't think that we... - No!
take it up again!
Oh, my God!
I need some help here! Dr. Shepherd!
what happened?
Dr. Bailey, could we speak for a moment?
uh, I'm about to get started here.
why don't I track you down when I'm done?
this is a conversation we should have now.
Dr. Grey can take over.
Dr. Bailey... - I will speak to you when I am finished here.
do you mind?
Oh, don't touch...
and move the suction one inch down.
get away from my... - Maybe even 4...
get away from my table!
bruising over the chest wall. - I need a portable ultrasound.
I don't need an ultrasound. My rib's broken. - His pulse ox is low.
what the hell happened?
please, don't.
he fell off the treadmill. - What... you're jogging now?
Oh! Yeah. Rib's broken.
stress test. He wanted out of here.
all right, can we get a portable X-ray in here?
I'm Dr. Robbins.
how you doing?
I should probably go.
I mean, I'm the last person they wanna see right now.
I'm sure they're glad to have you here.
it's stupid, right?
I mean, she's not even my kid.
maybe I could, uh, hang out a little, you know?
see if they need anything?
I can wait with you.
this is what the fracture looked like initially here.
what happened with Bailey?
I heard she got kicked out of her O. R.
I can't get into that with you. - Come on.
Oh, we don't have to go to Kepner's wedding.
I talked to her. We don't have to worry about any of that.
Why?
it's just simpler.
you know, um, my patient and her husband are interviewing women to date her lover when she dies.
they're all friends, and they're supporting each other through this horrible time.
and when Stan cries, Victor hugs him.
that's what it looks like when people are over each other.
you think I should be hugging Matthew?
why aren't we going to the wedding?
because my name starts with "A.
it's awkward, frankly.
it's probably gonna be awkward forever.
but that does not mean that it is not over between us because it is.
it's important to me that you believe that.
cause if you don't, I could really ruin our night.
I have some really nice ideas about our night.
okay, you've had a day.
day's over. I need you to clear out.
we need some more time.
we're having trouble with the vacuum seeding.
and we need to print out another conduit.
again? - Yes, we started a new one, and it should be done by 3: 00 A. M.
I mean, Cristina, no. It's not working.
you are not Christ child reincarnate.
you don't walk on water.
you have failed to revolutionize modern medicine and save a baby all in one fell swoop.
and you are endangering a child's life while you...
stop!
excuse me... - That's enough.
Ross, take a walk. - She wasn't gonna do this. Because of you.
I practically had to force her into it. - Ross, just...
because she cares about you.
Oh, somebody's got the hero worship down!
no, you've made this emotional.
you made it about your friendship.
if it was about the work, you would've gone to the chief of surgery, but you know what he would've said.
you'll get the printer tomorrow, Dr. Grey.
I'm sorry if that was out of line.
I just couldn't listen to her go after you like that.
Hey, you just about ready?
I was gonna check on our patient before I left, but maybe you should make sure
Leah's not near the room. I don't wanna make her cry.
when we're taking a break, I'm gonna ask you to keep it out of the hospital.
not that it isn't fun, all the drama in the O. R...
I realize that you're hurt, but when we got back together, we got back together based on the assumption that we both made mistakes and we were ready to start fresh.
I can't keep apologizing.
and you can't keep playing a victim.
if you want me back, I'm back, but I'm not here to be your whipping boy.
I've been sleeping on the couch for a week.
if I'm back...
I sleep in the bed.
uh, okay. I get a night to just digest this all.
and then fine, you can sleep in the bed.
that's enthusiastic.
fine.
Yeah, 100% my fault.
just stay out of my career!
I made one mistake. - Oh, one?
because I can think... - I waited for Derek to push me into it.
I should've gone to Owen Hunt myself, and I should've done it days ago.
I should've stopped the test.
well, he's a hard guy to say "no" to.
Yeah, but it's sort of my job.
well, he couldn't do the stress test.
he wasn't ready to go home.
you should go to Dr. Grey's for Thanksgiving.
me and these guys are gonna hang out with Dr. Webber. Is that okay?
Oh, you're blowing me off for some old guy in a hospital bed?
I'm sitting at the kids table.
I like the kids table.
you meet me after?
booty call.
well, we can do a potluck.
what exactly are you gonna cook?
I could probably handle a turkey.
you think they're gonna give you six hours off to baste a turkey?
it takes six hours?
you're not making a turkey.
what about fried chicken? From the Colonel's?
you said that you liked fried turkey.
the bucket lacks dignity.
it's family style.
they do make a nice mashed potato.
all right, I'm gonna make a list.
uh, biscuits. - Gravy.
coleslaw.
how many pieces? - Yes, and the gravy.
my best friend's a mean girl. Why did I choose that?
I don't know.
it never bothered me when she was mean to other people.
but it really sucks when she's mean to me.
well, is she mean or is she...
what?
nothing.
Oh, Meredith. You can invite Cristina if you want.
you know, Thanksgiving.
I checked with Emma. She's fine with it.
well, I'm glad she's fine with it.
it's just a cold.
muscle through it.
I'm gonna go pick up the kids.
it'll pass.
nothing's really wrong.
we're doctors.
we'd know if something was wrong.
we'll be fine.
nothing's wrong.
is this place where Georgie lives? - Oh, George.
Callie--she dumped me.
don't chase me anymore unless you're ready to catch me.
you erased my name from Burke's humpty dumpty surgery.
what I don't know is why.
you okay? - Absolutely.
stop worrying. Nobody has to know.
I saw you there, at the nursing home with my mother.
she lights up when you're around.
Meredith, I want to start over.
you're not going to retire. - I need more time.
I don't have any more time to give.
it's about your dad, George. - My dad?
many people don't know that the human eye has a blind spot in its field of vision.
there's a part of the world we are literally blind to.
what did I say? - Seriously?
seriously. - Seriously.
seriously. We're taking it slow.
I can take it slow.
I can take it incredibly slow.
we're taking it slower than that. We're starting fresh.
and starting fresh means no sex because...
because we started with sex last time, and it didn't go very well.
Plus, the waiting is fun.
and we need fun.
from now on I want to be bright and shiny.
bright and shiny, huh?
the problem is, sometimes our blind spots shield us from things that really shouldn't be ignored.
mom.
the nurses tell me you haven't been eating.
no time.
I've been in the O.R. all morning, and I've got back-to-back surgeries the rest of the day, so...
OK, I'm sorry that I haven't been visiting, it's just that I've been
I don't have time to coddle you right now.
I'm trying to save lives here. Do you understand? Do you?
Dr. Grey. - Chief.
for me? You shouldn't have.
the nurses said she hasn't been eating.
Oh, you wonderful man.
I'm interrupting. I'll--I'll go.
no, Chief. Uh...
you stay and I'll go.
sometimes our blind spots keep our lives bright and shiny.
today is the day, people.
today is the day when dark-and-twisty Meredith disappears forever and bright-and-shiny Meredith takes her place.
you're probably not gonna want to be friends with me anymore because the sheer intensity of my happiness is gonna make your teeth hurt.
but that's okay because life is good.
life is good.
what's going on?
George's dad got admitted last night.
Oh, my god. Is he okay?
Oh, no, he's fine.
he, uh, passed out, hit the floor and fractured his clavicle.
Yeah, but his clavicle's fine.
Callie said it's gonna be fine.
are those his A.M. Labs?
Yeah, complaining of severe abdominal pain.
he doesn't have peritoneal signs. That's good.
has anybody seen... ?
I was just looking at it.
don't you think me reading it is more important than you reading it?
sure. Fine.
he's gonna be fine.
you're on scut today. You'll be distracted.
no, I won't.
family members do not treat family members. Scut.
I'm scrubbing in on a surgery with Dr. Burke this morning.
of course you are.
Karev, Sloan， Grey, pit. Stevens, shadow Karev.
and let me remind you again of the rules of your probation.
I think she knows the rules, Dr. Bailey.
no touching patients, no talking to patients, no rolling your eyes at the patients or your superiors.
Hey. Good morning, Addison.
what's that supposed to mean?
it is a greetin... used in civilized cultures by their civilized inhabitants.
you're smiling. - Yeah. It's called happiness.
I understand why you wouldn't recognize it.
whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
we're, uh, being mature about this?
Yes, we are going to peacefully coexist in this hospital, unless you've reconsidered moving back to New York.
okay, then. We peacefully coexist.
interesting. - Yes.
we're adults. We're educated.
come on. Let's shake on it.
so I'm still wearing the rings.
I think they're stuck. - Have you tried soap?
I hear it's good and slippery.
you are a very strange person, Derek.
I am just bright and shiny, Addison, bright and shiny.
no, so then I just--I poed his shoulder right back in.
he didn't even flinch. Your brother is hard-core.
George? - Callie, what are...?
looks like you've got a full house, Mr. O'malley.
just waiting on the wife.
she's in D.C., uh, chaperoning a field trip.
Yeah, she's coming in today.
his clavicle's still hurting, so I added P.R.N. morphine every four hours.
and I've scheduled your endoscopy for this afternoon.
an endo-what? - Scope.
that's like--like a camera.
that sounds dangerous. Is that dangerous?
no, it's not dangerous. - Okay, I didn't ask you. I asked the doctor.
Yeah, let the doctor speak, Georgie.
white coat. Let's look at the white coat.
what about an X-ray?
cause I had that once, and I feel like he
shut up, both of you. Shut up.
O'malley. - What?
uh, n--since we're all...
well, she's not talking to you.
Ah, excellent. My invaluable intern.
is it "bring a hot blonde to work" day? No one told me.
sexual harassment.
Dr. Stevens is shadowing me today, so...
which one of these cases do you need us on?
it's a really tragic one.
I found out just this morning that I have over two weeks' worth of dry cleaning that needs to be picked up...
stat. - Cool. That's it?
see? We're like a well-oiled machine, you and me.
I also need you two to get me a sandwich from that pathetic excuse for a deli.
you know the one I like, Karev.
Oh, but go easy on the mayo this time.
I think you're trying to kill me.
I don't see why I can't at least help with my dad's endoscopy.
what about "no working with family"? Do you not understand?
I'm not asking to do the pro-- - Fine.
pick an intern.
what? - I'm being kind.
you want an intern assigned to your dad's case? Fine.
who do you want?
right now. Pick an intern.
excellent.
now we want to place a partial occluding clamp on the aorta.
slowly.
good.
now make sure all the grafts are de-aired before you remove the venous and aortic cannulas.
he's letting her decannulate the heart by herself?
freakin' unbelievable, huh?
what do we have?
Mia Hanson...5-year-old female, crush injury to the abdomen, blunt trauma to the head.
B.P. 90 over 60, pulse 110.
how was she injured? Backed over by her mom's S.U.V.
she's, um--her blood type is A-negative, and she's allergic to penicillin and, um, wheat.
I am so sorry, Mia. I am so sorry, baby.
has she had anything to eat today?
uh, cereal this morning around 6:30.
okay, Mrs. Hanson, we're going to take care of your daughter.
I am Mrs. Hanson. Mia is my child.
Anna is just the nanny who ran over my daughter!
God.
I'm gonna examine your neck, okay?
it's okay, Mia. My name is Meredith.
and Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Bailey are just trying to see where you're hurt, okay?
what the hell happened?
she ran over Mia in the driveway. - She what?
Mia wasn't supposed to be in the driveway.
Mrs. Hanson told me to go get some milk, and I--I didn't see her.
how do you not see a child standing in the driveway?
and where were you? - What?
what were you doing that you couldn't watch Mia for five minutes?
I was supposed to be in court.
Oh, you're on the phone
I was letting them know that I was going to be late.
instead of watching Mia.
Oh, so now this is my fault?
it's the car's fault, okay?
S.U.V.s have blind spots the size of Jupiter.
and yelling and fighting and placing blame is not gonna help your child.
is she gonna be okay?
she has blood in her ear canal.
we need to get her upstairs for a C.T.
okay, ready?
it's gonna be okay, baby girl.
get away from her. Now.
what? - Get out!
I can't believe you--you just decannulated a heart all by yourself.
I didn't decannulate the heart by myself.
I assisted Dr. Burke, who decannulated a heart.
why are you being modest? Modest looks weird on you.
it's no big deal, George.
how's your father, O'Malley? Anything new?
he needs an endoscopy, and, uh, Bailey won't let me be the intern on this case, but she said I could pick someone.
I was wondering if Cristina could be the intern on this case.
Why? - That shouldn't be a problem.
uh, uh, yes it is.
we have a carotid endarterectomy scheduled at noon.
I'll push it.
O'malley's father deserves the best.- Thank you, Dr. Burke.
not a problem, O'Malley.
your dad better get something interesting wrong with him real fast.
you're sick. She's a sick, horrible person.
tell me again why you put up with this crap?
because one of these days, he's gonna crack and let me in on a case.
you sure you want to do plastics that badly?
there you are.
what, did you go all the way to New York for my pastrami?
extra spicy, extra lettuce, light on the mayo.
mark... what are you doing?
lunch. Want my pickle?
Seattle Grace is a teaching hospital and part of your job is to teach.
your interns aren't your slaves.
fine. No pickle for you.
did you see that?
Sloan. He's using his interns to pick up his dry cleaning and his lunch.
I've got to do an endoscopy.
what the hell is going on with the men in this hospital?
how you doing, Mr. Jeffries?
Oh, Frank's doing okay.
he'd be doing a lot better if the twins were even.
uh, twins? - Frank's new pecs.
who is Frank? - You're looking at him.
Frank, these are interns.
I'm supposed to be teaching them. Apparently, this is a teaching hospital.
Karev? - Yeah, uh...
Frank Jeffries is post-op day three for pectoral enhancement surgery.
there was a slight complication when a seroma formed.
what is a seroma? - Buildup of blood and fluid under the skin.
sorry.
and that concludes today's teaching.
a tube was inserted into Mr. Jeffries' chest to drain the excess fluid.
I want you to monitor him, check the tube for fluid output and change his dressings. Dr. Stevens...
I guess you can watch.
actually, Dr. Stevens is an excellent doctor. - Yeah, that's what I hear.
you decannulated a heart this morning.
Yeah, I didn't decan-- - yes, you did.
and when Burke and I were fishing, I...
I noticed something weird with his hand like it had a spasm or something.
I'm sorry. Why are you even saying that? That is not funny.
I didn't say it was funny.
I said it was weird.
and him letting you decannulate a heart, that's weird.
you should sit with your father.
cause if you want something to worry about, you should worry about him.
my father is fine.
he's good--I have a good-- don't--this is Burke.
did you think that
I want Anna.
it's okay, Mia. Mommy and daddy are here.
and we are just going to take some pictures. Okay?
this is a big camera. I don't like it.
Grey... keep her still.
Mia, baby... it's okay. Mommy's here.
Where's Anna?
you need to lie very still, okay? - I want Anna.
how about I sing you the good night song?
and you pretend it's bedtime and stay super still, okay? Okay.
good night, Mia,good night, mommy, good night, daddy 
no, you're singing it wrong. - I am? I'm singing it wrong?
I want Anna.
she's in the waiting room, honey. I'll--I'll get her.
John! Let's all sing it together, okay?
no. I want Anna.
so now--but you pick--you pick a car.
okay. Um...
1968 Mustang gt390 fastback.
that's interesting.
no, that is hot. That is very hot.
car. Uh-huh.
Hey, Georgie. - How's dad?
they're not done yet, but I'm sure he's fine.
can I talk to you, Dr. Torres?
sure. - Excuse me.
what are you doing?
I'm talking to your brothers. - You don't have to do that.
it's okay. I don't mind.
I'm pretty sure Ronny and Jerry both have a thing for me.
I was gonna go with Jerry until he went all 1957 B-air.
I was like, "really"?
thank you for trying to help out with my family, but it's really not necessary.
George...I'm kidding about your brothers. Come on.
Callie, I'm serious.
I can handle my family on my own.
you broke up with me, remember?
we may have to do a partial nephrectomy.
do you think you can save Mia's kidney?
only if we can control the bleeders. Here, cauterize as I go.
thank you.
you poor baby.
it's not gonna be an easy recovery.
well, with parents like that, she didn't have it easy to begin with.
people do the best they can, Dr. Grey.
they don't know their kid's blood type.
they don't know her favorite song.
people want high-powered careers, I get that, but they should think twice before having kids.
Oh! I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean
what, that I should be home with my baby instead of here with this little girl and a surgical intern who can't cauterize the bleeders?
Dr. Bailey
if I were you, Dr. Grey, I would keep my eye on the surgical area and my mouth shut.
O'malley. How's it going with your dad?
good. The Chief's doing an endoscopy on him, so he's in good hands.
that was an amazing surgery this morning, the way you let Cristina decannulate that heart.
she shows tremendous promise in cardiothoracic surgery.
she said she didn't do it.
probably didn't want to rub it in. Make anyone jealous.
we're talking about Cristina.
everything all right with you?
sure. It's fine.
cause if anything ever wasn't, you know you could talk to me, right?
you've been through a lot lately, getting shot, all that--it can't be easy.
Yeah.
has it not been easy?
it's fine. Send my best to your dad.
okay.
Hey. - Hey.
this civil and mature thing, how far does it go?
meaning what?
meaning is it pleasantries in the hallway, or do we actually interact?
Oh, I don't know. That sounds drastic.
I'm worried about Richard. He seems down to me.
well, he's separated from his wife.
that usually doesn't make a person giddy, except in my case.
I think he could use somebody to talk to.
so talk to him. - No, I think we both should.
you know, so it's clear that he has people to turn to.
because he's a little depressed?
well, because I don't think he's spoken to Adele in weeks, and he's our friend, and he has always been there for us.
when you get divorced, doesn't that mean your wife is supposed to stop nagging you?
maybe if you took the rings off it would help.
are you gonna come with me to see the Chief or not?
fine. Yes. Okay.
thank you. - Let's do it.
and I will try soap. For the rings, I mean.
okay.
Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Oh, look at you.
Oh, d-do they still look lopsided? I mean, from the seroma.
no, it looks like most of the swelling has gone down.
yeah? Oh, yeah.
Hey, uh, Dr. Stevens, would you take a look at the twins?
Frank would like a woman's perspective.
you're just looking. - Oh. Oh, nice.
Yeah, it looks pretty even to me, very defined.
and the redness should go away in a couple of days.
good. Good.
Frank got them for his girlfriend.
he doesn't want her to see 'em till their perfect.
your girlfriend asked you to get pec implants?
Oh, no. No, no.
Frank's girlfriend joined a gym, got a trainer named Lars.
what kind of name is that--Lars?
so you got fake pecs 'cause you're jealous of a guy with a fake name?
well, uh, my last girlfriend Veena...
left me for a guy with hair so I got plugs...too late.
this time around, Frank's not taking any chances.
Frank sees the signs of discontent, Frank's fighting back.
Oh, yeah. - I don't know.
I just don't get the whole fake boob thing, no offense.
Oh, these are--these are top of the line.
I mean, they--they look real, they feel natural.
no, really. Feel 'em.
really. Come on.
very solid. - And real.
I don't know about that. - Well, compare them to his.
I'm not involved with this. - Come on.
don't be such a baby. - Oh.
this... this is why I don't work with interns.
Mrs. Hanson. - She all right?
Yes, we were able to stop the bleeding.
Dr. Shepherd has ordered an M.R.I. of her skull fracture.
hopefully she won't need any more surgery.
Oh, thank god.
uh, she's in recovery. Dr. Grey will take you up to her.
thank you. Uh, can we wait just a minute?
my husband went downstairs to use a landline. His battery died.
sure. - So Mia she's okay?
Oh, she is. Yeah. She, um...
keeps asking, uh, for Anna.
we fired Anna.
she just seems very attached to her.
that's my fault, according to my husband, because I'm a working mother.
he's a working dad, but apparently that's not the issue.
I love my job. I love Mia more.
she is my baby. She's my...
I love my daughter and I love my job.
I'm not good at the mom stuff, but I'm good at my job.
I mean, why bother having a kid if you're only gonna see it on weekends and holidays?
you might as well just get a cat.
I talked to Burke. I think he's fine.
you did what? - What's wrong with Burke?
nothing's wrong with anybody.
do you know he let her decannulate a heart this morning?
you decannulated a heart this morning, by yourself?
bitch. - No, not by myself.
now she's lying about it.
yang decannulated a heart. Why is Alex not surprised?
Izzie isn't either.
last week, Izzie was digging through crap. This week, she's fondling man-boobs.
no decannulating hearts for Izzie.
why aren't you bragging about decannulating a heart?
I didn't decannulate the heart. - Izzie and Alex do not believe you.
okay, what are you two doing?
Izzie and Alex have a patient who speaks about himself in the third person.
they thought it was annoying at first, but now they kind of like it.
good. Is it gonna stop soon?
wow, what happened?
this morning you were all "bright and shiny" and asking to be kicked in the face.
I am. I'm bright. I'm shiny.
Yeah.
Izzie thinks this whole bright and shiny thing is getting old.
Alex agrees.
we think you're depressed.
both of you? - Yes.
well, for the two of you to agree on something, I must damn near be suicidal.
we agree on things. - We agree on this.
so... start talking.
Adele and I...
she wants me to step down as Chief, retire.
you, retire? That's crazy. What would you do?
uh, spend a little more time with his wife, perhaps?
she's being unreasonable.
she wants him to know that his marriage is a priority to him.
she's using his work as an excuse.
or he is. Some men use work.
some men use other women. - Some women use other men.
I've been visiting Ellis Grey.
I was lonely, and you had checked out and I was lonely.
I work, I visit Ellis. That's my day.
you gave up on us first. I was there.
I make time for Ellis. I don't make time for Adele.
there's something driving a wedge between Richard and Adele.
now maybe you don't see it, but I do, and so does Adele.
maybe he sees it and doesn't want to do anything about it.
he's gotta do something about it. That's what marriage is built on, change.
change is what keeps marriage alive.
the man has a right to do whatever he wants to do
Stop...helping me.
look, I miss my wife. I want her back.
I don't want my marriage to be over.
your marriage isn't over until you decide it is...
right.
until you decide that the-- well, that the sacrifice just isn't worth it.
right.
come in. Oh, Yang.
O'malley. - Yeah.
I have your father's test results.
you gotta ask for it.
Hey, we've been waiting here forever. Where's the doctor?
uh, Dr. Webber will be in in a couple of minutes.
won't tell you anything, huh, not till you're a real doctor?
I am a real doctor. Ronny!
I just--I'm just not dad's doctor.
what is it, Georgie? Let's just wait for Dr. Webber.
no, I think he's expecting you to tell him.
but he's coming. He said he's coming.
he's coming in later.
you should--I mean, you should tell your dad
what's with the whispering?
the biopsy results were abnormal.
well, is abnormal bad or...
just different?
sir...you have cancer in your esophagus, which has spread to your stomach.
we need to operate to remove it, and you'll need to undergo chemotherapy and radiation.
I'm sorry.
they're gonna try to operate soon. This week, I think.
it's a stage III metastatic cancer. So...
and my--my brothers... are...
and, uh... C-Callie slept with Sloan.
I just can't...
I...I can't...
I can't deal with--with any of it.
I spent the entire day worrying about Burke, like there was something wrong with him.
but there's nothing wrong with Burke and...
God, my dad has cancer, I can't even look him in the face.
Cristina had to tell him wh-what was wrong.
nobody gets it right with their own family.
I certainly don't.
Yeah. - Yeah.
Callie slept with Sloan?
I don't get you people.
us with the boobs?
we make a lot of decisions. - Yeah.
dude, I still can't believe you went through all this for a chick.
what, you never did anything crazy for love?
not like this.
you have a girlfriend? - No.
Dr. Stevens?
Frank can sense the vibes.
I'm not talking about this with you.
what, she left you for another guy?
Frank's hit a nerve.
it's more complicated than that.
uncomplicate it then, man.
grand gestures is what I'm talking about.
be like Frank. Just figure out what she wants and make it happen.
just forget all about the other guy.
trust Frank. Frank knows.
Hey, what do we got?
the second M.R.I. report shows bleeding in Mia's brain.
Oh, damn it.
I need to go in, try to relieve the pressure.
two surgeries in one day? - But she's tough.
and right now we don't have any other options.
here.
not so bright and shiny.
I thought the cancer was in my gut. What are we looking at my heart for?
your E.K.G. showed some abnormalities, so we just want to make sure your heart's healthy enough to support you through the surgery.
you're a smart girl. Yes.
george told me you were the best intern I could have on my case.
he said that?
he said you were the best intern in the hospital.
said you keep everyone on their toes, even him.
Dr. Yang, you should take a look at this.
okay.
you paged me?
what is Burke doing in there?
I did a pre-op echo. His aorta valve is leaking.
he won't make it through the cancer surgery unless we replace it.
it's just a valve replacement, George. It's gonna be fine.
Burke will do it.
Burke will do it, and you will clear his schedule.
if someone is gonna operate on my dad's heart, I want it to be Burke.
Yeah. - Okay.
it's gonna be fine. It's a valve replacement.
it's Preston Burke. If someone's gonna cut your dad's heart apart, you want it to be him.
what?
what's wrong with Burke's hand? - Nothing.
he's gonna operate on my father. - George, Burke is fine.
your dad will be fine. - You're lying.
Burke is hiding something, and you're helping him.
leave me alone.
you wanted to see me, Chief?
it's about your mother.
I-I know your relationship with her is, uh...
complicated.
and I know you know that she and I were
chief, it's okay.
what really matters is that you make her happy, and my father couldn't and I couldn't, so
Meredith, I...
I can't see your mother anymore.
I need to make...
I need to try to make my marriage work.
and if I'm gonna do that...
I have to stop seeing your mother.
I see.
she...
she's an extraordinary woman.
she worked so hard, she sacrificed so much, and to see it end like this, it...
take good care of her for me.
we got it from here. Yo.
okay, Frank. Time to take the tube out.
Izzie, put on some gloves. - What's going on?
Alex, what are you doing?
you ready to take out Frank's boob tube?
what about the rules? What if Sloan finds out?
screw Sloan. - She knows what she's doing, right?
I promise you, Frank, the twins are in excellent hands.
grand gesture. Frank gets it.
what's he talking about? - Nothing.
you sure about this? - Oh, yeah, he's sure.
looks like we can safely evacuate the clot.
want to cook the pumper?
did you ever think about having kids?
Derek and I talked about it, but I wasn't ready.
I love kids. I'd have a dozen.
believe me, one's enough, unless you plan to put away your scalpel.
that's why god invented nannies.
I wish it were that easy.
what do I do with these, hock 'em, keep 'em?
my mom says post-divorce wedding rings are bad juju.
your mom says juju? - She does.
so wh--what would your mom do?
burn 'em, bury 'em.
you want 'em?
Oh--oh, I-I want some rings, just not bad juju rings.
then again, my mom's kind of insane.
Hey, don't talk smack about your mom.
yesterday, I left for work early, and Tuck's favorite food was strained peas.
nasty green gunk, but he loved them, ate them for breakfast.
I got home after a 15-hour shift, and he doesn't like strained peas anymore.
he only wants carrots.
life moves so fast.
everybody moves on. - Yep.
where you going? - I'm not ready to move on.
do you know why I picked you to be my dad's intern?
because you are a robot.
you're a freakin' robot in a white coat who never makes a mistake, and most of the time, I appreciate that.
most of the time, I really feel like I have something to learn from you.
but right now--right now, need you to try, just for a minute,
I need you to try to be a human being.
thank you, Alex. I can't believe you let me help.
Alex is cool, you know that? Alex is the coolest.
Oh, Alex knows it. Izzie isn't so bad herself.
no, Izzie is rocking. Izzie is back in the game.
I can't. Alex, I'm sorry.
Hey, Mia.
can you say something for me?
I need to hear how great you talk.
can you say my name? Can you say Meredith?
Wh-where's... Anna?
that was great.
guess who's here. Mom and dad.
Hey. How's my baby girl, huh?
I want Anna. Anna.
Diane, wait. Diane, where are you going?
so we'll do the thing with the heart tomorrow?
maybe tomorrow. Uh, maybe in a couple of days.
I don't--I don't know quite yet.
but, uh, Dr. Webber and Dr. Burke said we should get to it quick.
and we will get to it as quick as we can.
I just want to make sure that we do it right.
I just don't understand why they're operating on his heart when the cancer is in his gut.
Yeah, it's complicated. Um...
you know what I was thinking? Maybe the tests are wrong.
okay? Maybe it's not cancer.
Cause--'cause--'cause cancer runs in the family, right?
and no one else in the family has cancer.
it--it is cancer. Okay?
it's stage III metastatic esophageal cancer.
Meta-whatic? - Metastatic.
it's, uh, when the cancer cells have migrated from their point of origin
okay, you're talking doctor now, George. Just talk English.
I am talking English, you're just not listening!
no, you're just not saying anything that we understand!
boys.
imagine your dad's like a
like a vintage car, okay? - Callie
and, uh, his--his blood's like gas flowing through the fuel lines.
the cancer cells are like the gunk that builds up in there.
and fouls up--fouls up the plugs. Exactly.
once the gunk starts circulating, it can do a lot of damage to the whole engine the carburetor, everything.
it's--it's like the engine had already blown a gasket even before all the other damage started.
good night, hot fudge it's time to say good night. Good night, Mia...
when it comes to our blind spots...
maybe our brains aren't compensating.
maybe they're protecting us.
I'm glad you came to visit.
but you can't stay. I'm expecting someone.
actually... mom, he's not coming.
what?
the Chief. Richard.
he's not coming tonight.
It's--in fact, it's just gonna be me for a while.
he's gone back to Adele. - Yes.
of course he has.
mom...
he's afraid, afraid to be happy.
and I'm all alone.
now I have to raise my daughter alone.
how am I expected to do that?
mom...
you did the best you could.
you did the best you could. That's all anybody can do.
how am I looking?
good. You're ready for surgery.
that's good, I guess.
I don't know how I'm gonna tell my wife about all this.
40 years, we've been married, and now... cancer and a heart condition?
she was always telling me how I should eat better and take better care of myself.
I guess I shoulda listened.
George... is the best.
what? - He's the best... intern.
he's a good doctor and he's a good person, and whatever happens, I just thought you should know that
that you raised a good person.
thank you, Dr. Yang.
I didn't know you still felt that way about me.
me neither.
I can't. I'm sorry.
Alex gets it.
Alex is sorry he's such an idiot.
can Izzie buy Alex a drink?
Alex would like that. Izzie can.
I know what time it is.
I-I-I don't care if he's sleeping, just wake him up.
he could sleep late-- no, wake him up.
okay.
Now--no, uh, put the phone to his ear.
Hey. Hey, Tuck.
it's mommy. Hey.
george knows.
I may not be cut out for bright and shiny.
I'm not either.
we can be dull and lifeless together.
I am glad you're in my bathtub.
me, too.
marry me, Cristina yang.
are you saying yes? - Y-yeah.
we're married!
Adele and I are getting a divorce.
has it even occurred to you that maybe I'm not interested?
I raised you to be an extraordinary human being.
so imagine my disappointment when I wake up after five years and discover that you're no more than ordinary.
you want to know why I'm so ordinary?
you want to know what happened to me? You.
you happened to me.
disappearances happen in science
disease can suddenly fade away, tumors go missing.
we open someone up to discover the cancer is gone.
it's unexplained, it's rare, but it happens.
we call it misdiagnosis...
say we never saw it in the first place...
any explanation but the truth.
that life is full of vanishing acts.
if something that we didn't know we had disappears, do we miss it?
Meredith! What are you doing?
I was taking a bath.
that's not a bath. I know what a bath looks like.
drop it. - Look, your mother
drop it. - Your mother
look, your mother was lucid, and she said things, and now she's
gone, and everything's back to normal. It's not a big deal.
Yeah, except she's having heart surgery today.
Hey, do you want me to talk to the Chief?
I know you have the triage thing today, but he'll give you the day off.
stop. I do not need rescuing.
Oh, you would have drowned in the bathtub had I not been there.
I'm a surgeon. I do the rescuing.
you are not my knight in shining... whatever.
so we're gonna fight because I pulled you out of the tub?
you have a place. You could sleep at it.
and then you don't have to pull me out of the bathtub.
you're everywhere, all the time, saying things.
this is the happy ever after part.
and in the happily ever after part, the guy is there, all the time, saying things, and the girls love it.
go to work. I'll see you there.
just for the record, I am your knight in shining whatever.
I did not try to drown myself in the bathtub.
Hey, I ate everything out of the fridge last night, everything, including a tub of butter.
there's no judgment here.
you ever feel like you were disappearing?
all the time.
why can't I just be that happily ever after person?
why can't I believe in that?
I don't know what I believe in anymore.
we're not telling people.
I haven't told anyone. - I know, I know. Just don't.
I'm not going to, yet.
no, I just--I-I need to tell my friends he first.
but I have friends here.
Oh, no. You can't tell Shepherd.
you cannot tell Shepherd until I've told Meredith.
it would be a thing.
you act like this is a disaster.
the world won't implode if people know.
I will tell them, today.
just... wait.
good morning. - Morning.
morning.
what's different?
nothing. - Leave him be.
what happened to your hair? - Nothing.
what happened to your hair? - Leave him be.
he dyed it. - But why?
Ow! - Leave him be.
what am I doing? What?
okay, but why?
men who have gray hair are noticed less than men who don't.
by who?
well... - by the ladies?
looks good, Chief. - Oh, very natural.
ladies will love it.
he is alone... all alone.
do any of you even know what that's like?
lives with Cristina, dates the perfect 12 year old...
man-whore...
his wife left him after 25 years of marriage.
so if the man wants to dye his hair for the ladies, let him dye his hair for the ladies.
leave him be.
it's--it's weird. It's weird. It's weird, right?
I need more triage tear tags.
living with somebody I'm married to is weird.
I mean, I'm his boss and his wife.
at work, I'm giving him orders.
in bed, he's giving me
stop right there. I don't need to know this.
I'm tired. I'm busy.
while I will concede you and O'Malley have some challenges to overcome,
I'm asking you to remember that this day is a marathon and my mind can only hold what it needs to know.
your sex life cannot be held in my mind today.
ever. It cannot be held in my mind ever, never.
whatever.
sydney Heron here to lend a hand. Hey. Hi. Hello.
Oh, Miranda, hey. Nice clinic. Very nice.
Hey, Sydney. - I mean real, real nice. Cheerful.
no better way to distinguish yourself for chief resident than to open a multimillion-dollar clinic. Smart thinking. Strategic.
chief resident?
I myself have used the time to master several complex surgical procedures.
but this is, um, another way to go.
what is she talking about? - The chief resident.
the chief resident. Yeah, for next year.
the one fifth-year resident that rules all residents.
Oh, she--okay, she's cute.
she's acting like she didn't know about it. Cute.
I'm not cute. - I'm on to you.
okay, I'm a competitor.
I bite. - Okay.
well, I'll just wait for you in the pit.
what? - Nothing.
What?!
okay, cranky. Fo-forget it.
am I the only one who thinks this triage test is a waste of time?
there's a platysmaplasty on the board.
I had Sloan all prepped to let me scrub in.
George, hey. - Hey.
how's it going? - Good.
you like living in a hotel? - Yeah, it's good.
cause your room's still there...
next to mine. - Oh, Izzie.
I'm just saying, if you don't like...the hotel, you can always just move right back in.
you think I'm this boy that you need to save.
I get that, but--and it--it would be sweet if--if it weren't so condescending.
seriously, is it too much to ask to be performing actual surgeries?
we are actual surgeons.
what? - Nothing.
a lot of arm swelling, but good distal pulses, so...
we can rule out compartment syndrome.
I suspect a radius fracture, so I'd splint and get an ortho follow-up.
anything else?
no. - Okay.
then I guess this means-- - time.
and I'm dead. - Dead?
you sent her home. The bone punctured through her skin.
Yeah, but she had multiple wounds and abrasions
a puncture over a break is an open fracture until proven otherwise.
Yeah, I got septic, and I died at home thanks to you.
Oh, whatever.
not "whatever" to dead "minor puncture wound that's not" guy.
you have to be quick and thorough while using your instincts.
you can't be fooled by what your eyes see.
if you assess wrong, your patient could die while waiting for treatment.
Karev, you're next.
just think, I've already killed her. You can't do more damage than that.
people, triage is one of the most important tools a doctor has.
in a real emergent scenario, you'll have only minutes.
and it's something you'll be tested on in your surgical ex
sorry. - George.
I was just recording the drill.
all right, we're working George, okay? - Yeah.
I'm your boss right now. - Yes.
all right? - Yes.
a very sexy one. - No, no, no.
you cannot undermine my authority... - yeah.
in front of the other interns, in front of my peers.
no.
O'malley, take that back to the clinic where it belongs.
sorry.
attention, people. Look, I'm sorry.
I have to interrupt the session for a moment.
chief, I like your new hair. It really brings out your eyes.
do you need something, sir?
we just received word of a mass casualty incident nearby.
all available level one trauma centers have been asked to respond.
I need to send a team into the field immediately.
is this a part of the exercise?
are we supposed to act appropriately, uh, tense?
this is not an exercise or a drill, Yang.
this is an emergent situation, and I need all hands on deck.
Seriously? - What happened?
I don't have details, just orders.
Meredith, I have a thing, news.
you aren't pregnant again, are you? 'Cause I can't handle the extra months of bitchiness.
we're catching a ride with Seattle 34.
space is tight, so hold your kits on your lap.
where are we going? - We'll know when we get there.
fire, flood, volcano? I'm not really dressed for a volcano.
Stevens. - Sorry.
inappropriate. Sorry. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm hauling supplies. I only have room for five.
Yang. - Yes?
stay with the chief.
take care of the incoming wounded. The rest of you, come on.
Stevens was inappropriate.
Hey, what was your, uh, news?
just forget it. Forget it.
Oh, everybody, move your I.D.S to the outside of your jacket.
when we get there, remember, triage. Karev.
green tags--nonemergent. Yellow--delayed care. Red tags--needs immediate treatment.
good. Assess carefully, tag and get all the critical patients into the ambulances as fast as possible.
don't get in the way of search and rescue, and stay calm.
any word yet on what happened?
all we know is there are multiple traumas.
holy mother of...
Dr. Bailey, where do you need us?
where should we start first?
Dr. Bailey-- - I don't have time to hold your hands.
you know the protocol. Go do it.
do what? - Go help people.
you need some help?
there's nothing more I can do here.
how did this happen?
it was a fog bank. Container ship clipped the ferry.
good. Take a deep breath for me.
okay, you're gonna be okay. Your injuries are minor.
an E.M.T. is gonna come and take you to the hospital, okay?
where is your mommy?
who are you with?
okay, I want you to stay right here, okay? Stay right here.
did you... wet your pants?
that's okay. It happens sometimes-- - coming through! Okay, okay. All right.
it just doesn't make sense. Ferry boats don't get in accidents.
they're safe. They're reliable.
the moment you take one for granted, along comes a container ship and boom.
I have a thing for ferry boats.
reschedule, uh, Swanson's, uh, valve replacement.
we're gonna need the O. R. For the incoming from the ferry accident.
I mean, this whole day had just been...
there's something wrong with Meredith.
I asked her what's wrong. She says nothing.
then she tries to drown herself in the tub.
n-not actually drowned, I don't think.
but something was going on, and she will not talk about it.
we were fine, and now it's like...
I'm living with a ghost.
you're confiding in me. - Yes.
Cristina and I are engaged.
Congratulations.
I mean, she doesn't want to tell anyone.
at least not until she tells Meredith first.
Yeah, they're different than other women.
Yes, these women... yes, they are.
you know, maybe we'll never know them. I mean, really know them.
and now that you and Cristina are engaged, you've got a lot of work to do.
you and Yang are gettin' hitched?
there's a mass casualty incident rolling in, okay?
there'll probably be some burn victims. You should be prepared.
Oh, Sydney.
I-I thought I could take a few patients off your...
I appreciate the gesture, Dr. Callie O'Malley.
but the chief asked me to roll the nonemergent E.R. cases into the clinic and take care of them, so I've triaged these patients, and so far it looks like a
a sore throat, a sprain and a tummy ache--easy breezy.
so the clinic and I are fine.
okay, I'm not, uh, trying to take the clinic
uh, Bailey's clinic, by the way--away from you. I'm offering to help, so...
your offer to help is duly noted and very much appreciated, but I promise you
got it all under control. So...Jason Kaye?
fine.
I'll leave you to it and, uh, find myself a recently traumatized emergency surgery to scrub in on while you stay down here with your sore throat and your sprain and
what was the other one? - Tummy ache.
excuse me, are you a nurse, a doctor, m-medical something?
I'm a doctor, but-- - all right, come with me.
um, no, you--you need to get checked out.
there's a treatment area right over there. - Follow me, please.
you've got some really bad burns. They need to be treated.
my buddy's trapped. He's trapped under a car.
if he's trapped under a car, you need search and rescue.
they have--they have personnel,
their medical personnel-- - I called them. They're backed up, and he can't wait. He's in a real bad way. Please.
he's my best buddy.
please.
shepherd, I need you in the next rig. - Okay.
I want you at that scene. - You don't need me here?
they're reporting lots of closed head injuries.
I want you to get in there and bring 'em back alive.
okay, what's the news? - Shepherd and Grey are on the rocks.
Burke and Yang got engaged.
you need highlights.
in your hair--that's why it looks so odd.
I'm gonna go save lives.
take him to the treatment area.
they'll fix you up there, okay?
I got somebody down here.
Hey! That's not secure.
Hey!
Doctor,I need you to get back up here. - There's a pregnant woman down here! Just shut the...
Oh, hell.
she dead?
Yeah.
one second. Hold on. Hold on.
Immediate! Immediate! I need help down here!
he's back.
he's got help.
you hear that, Rick? We got help.
we got a doctor.
you'll be okay now, man. - He's gonna be okay?
right?
what we do know at this time
what we can tell you--is that there have been deaths.
and we may not know that for hours, even days.
we also know that passengers are still being evacuated...
all right, you're gonna need these to handle the influx.
we're gonna need plenty of available open chest trays, central line kits and a difficult intubation cart.
Yes, sir.
...who knows what damage to the interior, we don't...
Oh, yang. - I-I know.
um, communicate with the scene as needed.
no. I heard you were engaged.
Congratulations.
thank you, sir.
all right, go, and remember, we're hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.
you got anyone for me?
uh, yeah, those two need to be transported.
uh, these five didn't make it--four adults and one child.
a child?
you found a dead child?
a boy or girl?
ma'am, you're injured. You need to lie down.
get a stretcher, now.
is the child a boy or a girl?
I can't find my son.
we got separated.
I-I need to know if my little boy is alive.
she was a girl.
the child was a little girl.
no, no, no, no. I need to examine you.
I'm gonna have to take you to the hospital.
no, I can't leave!
he's only 7.
No! And--and he's all alone.
no. No, I will not leave my son behind.
No! No, I will find him.
listen to me. I will find him.
if you let me take you to triage, I promise you will find your son.
he's so scared.
Yeah, I know. I know.
I'll find him.
okay? - All right.
he's a mechanic.
we--we work together.
we--we drive together to work, and--and suddenly there was this huge jolt.
it was awful.
we were just trying to get outta there.
but rick went back in- -figured we could help.
we should help.
he went back.
there were people trapped.
he was trying to help.
we were behind him.
we--we were right behind him.
there's injuries to his chest and leg.
it looks like his arm is broken, and I'd guess there's damage to his spine and pelvis.
I can't--there's--there's not much that I can do until we get him out of here.
you gotta do what you can.
I mean, we'll, uh...
Greg, go find some more guys.
Hey, go find search and rescue, okay?
give them this.
tell them I said he can't wait.
he has to get to a hospital.
all right, I'm going.
let 'em know he needs a C.T.
make sure to keep his neck stable. I felt a step off.
ask for Waller.
if Waller's not available, ask for Krychek, okay?
keep him stable. What do you got?
Oh, hey, nurse, let me have some bandages.
thank you. Stop here.
Hey, Meredith, you got a free hand?
hold this bandage for me, will you? - Yeah.
you all right?
Yeah, it's just a lot.
you want to get married, and you haven't told me and I haven't asked, so now we have a problem?
what?
no, I don't want to get married.
you want to get married?
no.
good.
so if that's not it, what is it?
it isn't anything.
are you good? 'Cause I gotta get this kid triaged.
Yeah, I'm good. - Okay. Let's go.
she all right?
Yeah, she's good. She's just lost.
hang in there.
all the nonemergent surgeries have been postponed.
good. - I'm gonna go check on discharges.
I'm trying to free up as many beds as I can in the surgical wing.
Oh. I was gonna do that, but- -I can do it.
Oh, sure. Good.
unless you want to.
no, no. Go ahead.
you're still the chief.
I know that.
it just seems so quiet, you know?
Yeah.
we're expecting the first wave from the scene soon.
I dyed my hair blonde...
the day after Derek moved out.
change is good.
your marriage is over.
you're--you're starting over.
so am I.
right.
I specifically told you I needed to tell Meredith first.
I was talking to Shepherd, and...
it just came out.
it was no big deal.
it is a big deal, because now she's not even gonna care about the fact that I'm getting married.
all she's gonna care about is the fact that I didn't tell her myself.
then why didn't you?
there was a major disaster.
that was 45 minutes after we discussed it.
you were with your friends for 45 minutes running triage drills, and you weren't compelled to mention it?
the chief says they're rolling in soon, so...
her pressure's low--barely registering
and I don't see any good veins for an I.V.
she's all clamped down from hypothermia.
that's why I couldn't find a pulse.
I've never seen a crush injury so bad and survive.
she needs to stay on her left side.
we gotta move her on her left side.
it's gonna take both of us.
we gotta get that B.P. up.
on my count.
One...two...
your baby--your baby's okay.
for now it looks okay.
just try to breathe.
we need to move you to help with your circulation, okay?
one, two, three.
pulse is already better.
I'll attempt I. V. access again.
just breathe through the pain.
what you can do for your baby right now is take care of yourself.
good girl. I know it hurts.
come on now. Keep breathing for me, okay?
that's it. Breathe.
good.
um, what do we...so what do we do?
we wait.
we wait? - We wait.
okay, we need to find a grown-up--another grown-up--to help you find your mom.
Hey, uh, I need you to take this little girl to the triage tents.
I gotta get back to my unit.
no, I need you to take this little girl to the triage tents for me, please.
you're gonna be okay.
you're gonna be fine.
I promise, okay?
Thanks.
help! I need some help over here!
stay right here.
how we doing?
it's bad.
a lot of survivors, so that's something.
Yeah, it is.
have you seen Stevens?
no.
what about O'Malley, Grey?
grey was--I saw Grey about ten minutes ago.
she was on her way over here with a kid.
you haven't seen her? - No.
I gotta head out with this one, so keep an eye out for my interns, all right?
Yeah, I'll do my best.
Jane Doe, about six months pregnant, found under a pile of rubble.
she sustained crush injuries to her right and upper extremities as well as severe trauma to the face.
B.P. initially low, but now up to 90 over 60 after a liter of fluid and placing her on her left side.
what do we do?
Abc--her airway needs to be protected.
her breathing will be compromised because of the crush injury, and we need to have blood available.
I would do a trauma panel, type and cross and C.T. of her head and neck.
excellent. Let's get her started.
uh, trauma room two. Let's go.
one, two and three.
let's see what we have here.
the baby--the baby's gonna
make sure that you shield her in radiology.
we've got to get her stabilized first before you start worrying about the baby.
the amount of rads are negligible.
right, but she's gonna need a lot before all of this is over.
we need to protect the both.
yang, you're on this.
Alex, go to the clinic.
this is my patient.
I pulled her out of the damn water.
which is heroic and manly, and you still need to talk to those families right now.
why can't Yang do it?
this is all hands on deck.
yang can handle it. Now go.
okay.
he likes fire trucks...
and police cars--anything with flashing lights.
carlee Heit, 45-year-old female, found at the scene.
open abdominal wound with omental evieration.
okay, we need to get her to an O.R.
as soon as possible.
he won't respond if you call him Christopher.
he hates that.
just Chris.
okay. He likes Chris the best.
okay. O'Malley, what is she talking about?
she lost track of her son in the accident.
Dr. O'Malley and I made a deal.
he's gonna find my son so I know that Chris is okay before I go into surgery.
Mrs. Heit, your injury's extremely serious.
we need to tend to it as soon as possible.
as soon as he's located.
I can't go into surgery before I know about my son.
I'm sure he's here. All families are being dir
O'malley, just find the boy in a hurry, and we'll start the workup.
I need more gauze.
there's no more here.
maybe you could find some, uh, paper towels the head?
I'll find something.
Vince...Vince, it hurts like hell.
can you do anything about that?
I mean, can--you got anything for the pain?
I've given him everything I've got.
where is search and rescue?
it hurts.
what hurts, man?
E-everything.
maybe if--maybe if I try to set his arm, it'll help some with the pain.
what are you waiting for?
I, uh, um... - what?
nothing. Just, uh, stay there and hold his hand.
hold his hand?
you think he's in pain now?
he's not. Hold his hand.
place both hands on opposite sides of the fracture...
distract, exaggerate and reverse the mechanism in one continuous motion.
you are a doctor, aren't you?
shut up.
all right. All right.
Rick, you ready?
Yeah.
One...two...
what happened?
some metal--something in my leg...thrown off.
God, it hurts. It hurts.
okay. I started swimming.
I needed to go...got a meeting.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.
but try to stay still.
don't look. Turn around.
I need you be brave for me.
just stand right there and don't move and don't look.
what do we got?
Oh, we just got started.
all right.
but I got this.
there's nobody covering my service.
I'm gonna need you to get up to telemetry and check on my patients, pre-op and post-op.
and then I should join you in surgery?
no. And then you should report to the pit.
uh, the chief assigned me to Jane Doe.
Yes. Now I'm reassigning you.
to do what, sutures?
Yes. Okay, so--so you're sayingyou don't--you don't want me to scrub in.
Dr. Yang, I'm saying that I have an unattended cardiothoracic wing and a pit full of patients that you have the ability to help.
I don't need you in the O. R.
I need you on the floor.
do you have a problem with that?
no. Thank you.
no, not--Chris Heit.
he's 7 years old.
he's got brown hair.
I don't know if he's injured.
I'm...could you at least check to see if he's there?
Yes, I know all the families were directed here.
could you just check?
thank you. Yeah.
Callie, I need some help.
I can't. I'm busy.
Yeah, okay.
it's just, uh, I'm trying to find this--George, I'm busy.
I'm about to go into surgery, okay?
I can't be your wife right now.
I'm working.
I'm working, too.
I have a patient who needs surgery.
so do I.
Yes, any luck?
thank you.
okay. Damn it.
can I get some helpover here?
sweetie, listen to me.
I need you to turn around.
I know I told you to face away from me, but we have to work together to help this man.
I don't talk either when I get scared.
I don't...talk when bad things happen.
you don't have tosay anything.
but I need your help.
okay, don't look down. Don't look at the blood.
look at me. Look at me.
can you be my assistant?
okay, good.
I can't move my hands off where they are right now.
so I need you to go over to my kit and pull out, uh, the things--they look like, um, like tweezers.
you know what your mommy uses to pull a splinter out with?
Hey, what was the site like?
was it gory?
was it a trauma bonanza?
I mean, obviously terrible.
I don't talk with thieves.
what?
you stole my Jane Doe right out from under me.
I am not a thief.
you balked.
you're a balker.
I was thinking.
well, again, not my problem that thinking is such a time-consuming process for you.
I rescued her.
I climbed down.
I pulled a massive pylon off of her.
I got her here alive.
pylons?
there are pylons on people?
whatever.
now I get stuck babysitting the patients' families while you get to scrub in.
well, I'm not scrubbing in.
I'm stitching up patients in the pit.
huh. Who did you piss off to get that?
I happen to be pulling gaping pieces of flesh back together.
you're stitching.
you're just one step closer to knitting your grandma a sweater.
well, at least mine's medical.
well, you're knitting.
I pull pylons off people.
orange juice? Orange juice? Orange juice?
Oh, sweetie.
Yeah, h-his color's not good.
do you want some orange juice?
maybe I have some wheat crackers, something to put in your belly?
no.
everybody, if you're--if you're waiting to hear about your families, we should be hearing something very soon.
I'm sorry.
he must have saved at least a dozen people who were stuck under cars.
we told him not to go back.
that's the kinda guy he is.
he's the guy that goes back.
he's got kids, too, five of 'em.
okay, I'm committed to the project.
I don't need to hear about the kids.
leave the girl alone, Vince.
sorry. You're doinga real great job there, doc.
Hey, how's he doing?
he's doing all right.
no, no, he's not.
I can't do anything more until we get him out from under this car.
can you please tell me why you've come back by yourself?
search and rescue--they're buried.
they said they'd come when they can.
did you show them the red tag?
he's a red tag?
they said they got 15 red tags.
come on, guys. Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
no, no, no, no. Don't do this, man.
s-stay with me. Stay with me.
what happened?
HE--HE--HE let go of my hand.
he's gone limp.
wake up, Rick!
Hey. I'm not gonna be able to make it to your surgery.
but here's the thing...you were crushed underneath a cement pylon.
now dozens of people on that ferry boat died.
but you're still alive.
so when I come back to check on you after the surgery, you better still be alive.
all right?
you hear me?
all right.
her B.P.'s stable.
so is the baby's.
you did good, Karev.
is she gonna be okay?
you know, we're gonna...
we're gonna do everything we can.
what about the baby?
I mean, is she gonna be able to carry it to term?
um...you should get back down to the clinic.
look, Mrs. Heit, it's time.
we really need to operate before you lose any more blood or your bowels start to die.
Just...wait...till Dr. O'Malley finds my son. Please.
Dr. O'Malley...George...did you find him?
is--is he okay? Is he awake?
one of his pupils is blown.
we don't have a lot of time.
what are you gonna do?
God, you can't let him die.
I'm sorry.
I'm doing what I can.
well, it's not enough.
please just--just look, they're not gonna get him out of here any time soon.
so you gotta figure out a way to help him right here, right now.
finally.
fatima? - Fatima's a little girl--hold on.
hold on.
I'm--I'm, uh, I'm Dr. Karev.

it's posted over there.
I-I understand, but
please, just, Kelly--she's got brown hair. She's about 5'4."
okay, look, we had a lot of people who came in without I. D.

I just have to bandage him up, we're gonna find someoneto take him to the hospital, and then we're gonna findyour mommy.
I gotta get outta here! - No, sir, don't move!
like I said...
disappearances happen
pains go phantom...
blood stops running...
and people-- people fade away.
there's more I have to say...
so much more.
but...
I've disappeared.
did you check on kramerin 2309?
because his x-rays are done, and I don't know what to do.
Higgins in 2312 needsdiet orders before he can eat. - Okay, done and done.
um, I need you to monitor collins in 2323.
page me if his systolicdrops below 90.
I gave him a loading dose of dig to lower his heart rate.
have either of youseen dr. Grey?
uh, I checked on her earlier, but she'sa little sedate today so
not dr. Ellis grey. Dr. Meredith grey.

Chris is fine.
he's glad you're okay, and he'll be waiting for youafter surgery.
he's being very brave. - That's my chris. That's my boy.
thank you, dr. O'malley, so much.
Dr. O'malley.
hold up a second.
so what happenswhen the happy mother in therewakes up after surgery and herson isn't there to greet her? What then?

if she wakes up after surgery because my lie helpedto save her life,
I'm okay with that, dr. Bailey.
find that child. - Yes, ma'am.
her echo showedcardiac tamponade.
so our first priorityis stabilize the traumatic pericardial effusion.
well, keeping mom alive means keeping baby alive.
I'll monitor the surgerywhile he operates.
I'll notify the O. R.

is she still a jane doe? - Yeah.
Oh, to be in that condition and have no one who knows youeven know...

I mean, she's all alone.
it makes you think.
you know, if I went missing, would anyone noticeI was gone?
do something.
he's still seizing. There's nothing more I can do.
you're supposed to putsomething in his mouth so he doesn't bitehis tongue, aren't you?

Yes. His left pupil is blown. He's gone limp.

I can't doburr holes out here.
do you want to savehis life, stevens?
Yes. - All right.
I need a mine to checksomething out in the book, and then I'll talk youthrough it.
you're looking it up in a book?
I'm not a neurosurgeon, stevens, and I want to make surewe get this right.
somebody find me a copy of boardman's neurosurgery!
everything okay?
you know anythingabout making burr holes?
done it a couple of times.
good. Don't go anywhere.
Stevens, listen to me.
I'm gonna need a drill. - There's one in my truck.

my husband'snot on that board. - Kelly winter--she's not either.
what does that mean?

walked awayfrom the site or - - just say it.
a lot of people died. They're dead.
w-we don't know that.
so how can we know?
my wife, she wasn'tin these photos either. But she's pregnant.

she's pregnant?
what?
it's okay. Just think. Which way is she? Which way?
it's okay. take your time.
take all the time you need, you're doing great.
is it? Good.
okay.
use your words.
where exactly is meredith?
the leak in the heart is coming fromthe right atrium.
are you gonna put heron bypass? 'Cause that couldcompromise the baby.
no, I can fix her heart while it's still beating.
push 40 milligramsof esmolol.
I found her husband. I found him.
she's not a jane doe. Her name's casey. Casey clark.
what? - How do you know?
what? - How do you knowit's casey clark?
well, she's pregnant and
there were hundreds of people on that ferry, alex, hundreds, and chances are that more than one was pregnant.
now do not give that man hope unless you are certain.
do not give him hopeuntil you've checked every last bodyin the morgue.
Dr. Burke, can I, uh... - yes, make it fast.
I gotta tell you, this group of interns...
emotional. - Headstrong.
hotheaded, stubborn. They think they know everything.
you can only give themso much rope before they hangthemselves with it.
it's like they loseall rationality, don't wantto listen to reason.
jeez, preston. Don't hold back.
she's getting hypotensive.
I'm seeing some late decels on the fetal heart monitor.
the baby is not gettingenough blood.
Almost...just got... one more stitch.
got it. Turn on the echo.
baby's heart reis stabilized.
OD. Then we've seenthe worst of it.
what's the deal?
do you know how massive this hospital is?
how many people--not just sick people...
not to mention, if I'm a little kid, how many places can I hide? He's little.
a little kidcan hide anywhere.
what, you're lookingfor a kid?
Yeah.
his mom's in surgery, and I, um...
if I don't find him, bailey will...
well, to start, she'll change her son's middle nameto...
Elvis or... tupperware or...
I'm not kidding. Anything will be better than george.
I know a place a kid might be.
Really?
you coulda warned me.
well, you didn't checkdown here, right? - No.
so stop whiningand tell me if you find a pregnant chick.
you know, you're not the only one with a detail that sucks.
you know, I'm supposed to deal with these freaked-out families.
I'm not good with people. They should justlet me stick to patients.
patients areeople, especially kids.
you know what I mean. - He's facedown.
how does that...
come here and help meturn his body right.
dude... - don't tell meit doesn't matter.
God, I swear to... - dramatic much?
this doesn't bother you?
any of this?
all this death, it doesn't mean anything to you?
I'm working. Why would it?
Yeah, well, there's workingand then...
Caucasian female, about 30 years old.
she's... she's pretty.
she looks aboutseven months pregnant.
now remember, stevens, that drill isn't just gonnstoplike a neurosurgical drill, so as soon as you feel a release in pressure, stop the drillor you'll pierce his brain.
even if I don't see blood?
trust your instincts, stevens. Trust the feel of it.
I'm ready.
no, wait. I need toclean the drill offone more time.
you've cleaned ita dozen times, stevens.
it's as cleanas it's gonna get.
you ready?
Yes.
okay.
place three fingersabove the ear and two or three fingersin front of that on the sidewhere the first pupil blew.
got it. - All right. Now use a scalpel to makea vertical scalp incisiondown to the skull.
jeez.
I see a lot of blood, a lot.
superficial bleeders. Nothing to wor about.
are you at the skull? - Yes.
drill a hole in the middleof the incision.
Oh, god.
okay, that can't happen. Do you understand me? Sounds can't happen.
freaking out can't happen. Because if you freak out, I'm gonna freak out.
and I'm the one holding a powertool to your friend's brain.
so if you're gonna vomit, if you're gonna make sounds, step away.
if you're gonna stay here, you have to pull it together. Okay?
we're good, doc.
okay. I'm ready.
the temporal bone'sonly gonna be a coupleof millimeters thick.
okay, I'm in.
but the dura looks fine.
you're gonna have togo in again.
frontal lobe, right? - That's right.
just behind the hairline, a few centimetersoff the midline.
this bonewill be thicker, about five times as thickas the temporal bone.
okay. Got it.
second hole done. - What do you see?
I think I see blood. I s-see some blood.
okay, now this is important.
drill around the holeto expand the opening. You have to tryand relieve the pressure.
okay.
okay. Uh, the hole is about 2 centimeters around now.
I see blood. I definitely see blood.
try to evacuate as much of the clot as you can.
with what? I don't have suction.
use your finger, gauze, anything.
I see clotted blood.
no arterial? - No.
good. Now how doesthe dura look?
is it bulgingor does it look lax?
it looks like it'S...
pulsating regularlywith the heartbeat. That's another good, right?
that's great, stevens.
if it's pulsating, that means blood and oxygenare entering the brain.
okay, now pack it with gauze soyou can minimize the bleeding.
o-okay. Now get that rescue rigin here.
nicely done, stevens.
is that it? Is he--is he gonna be okay?
we've relieved the pressureon his brain, but he's still gota lot of other injuries.
Hey. His eyes are open.
Hey. - hey.
Hey, kid. Kid.
you okay?
you need to come with me.
kid?
one, two, three, four, five.
our E. T.A. Is five minutes.
one, two, three, four, five.
one, two, three, four, five.
one, two, three, four, five.
how is she doing? - Good. No intestinal damage.
missed all her vital organs.
she's almost done here. You find her son?
I've looked everywhere. I've been in contact withthe scene, with mercy west, with seattle presbyterian. I've checked in, uh...
he's lost or... or, uh...
he's in the water.
so when she wakes up, I get to inform her that she's not going to die, she's just gonna want to die.
I'm sorry. I will--okay, I'm gonna keep looking.
Yeah, you do that.
his right pupil'snot dilated anymore, and he's normotensive, but hispulse is still up in the 130s.
okay, what's hisneurological status? - G. C.S. Is 8.
I'm sorry. I ran out of sterile drapes. I had to use some guy's t-shirt.
it wasn't sweaty or anything. He was a clean guy, but
okay, call the O. R. Tell 'em we're coming up.
I also droppedthe scalpel in the field, and by that time,
I hadused all the alcohol swabson the drill bit, so
I thinkwe should load him upon antibiotics, lots and lots of antibiotics.
Stevens you put a drillthrough a man's skulland didn't hit his brain.
you saved his life.
get cleaned up and get tothe O. R. You got work to do.
the O. R? - Yes, the O. R.
you're officiallyoff probation.
Oh, cristina! - Oh, my god.
you are not gonna believe what I just did. I'm gonna tell you, but you're not gonna believe it. You're gonna think I madethe whole thing up.
you're back? Is meredith back?
I drilled a holeinto this guy's skull... - what?
several holes, actually, with a drill I borrowedfrom a guy named vince, patched the holewith freakin' tissue, then brought him back here, and now I get to scrub inon his craniotomy.
so you haven't seen meredith?
it was like a ride, this crazy roller coaster ride with adrenalin shooting out of my ears.
you'd think that my hands would be shaking, but they weren'T. There was no shaking.
did I mention the drill? - Izzie, I getT.
you are a hero. I am jealous.
but I need to knowwhere the hell meredith is.
okay. I-I don't know where the hell meredith is.
but she should be back here. I didn't see herat the scene
the scene where I wasa rock star, by the way.
did I mentionI'm off probation? rock star.
these photos are fatalities.
I know it's difficult, but please try to I. D.Who you can.
we've agreedto let you do the honors...
a few more burr holesto start the craniotomy.
Really?
you saved his life. You might as well help finishwhat you started.
after I strip offthe periosteum, you can see what a high-speed pneumatic neurosurgical drillfeels like.
drill, please.
I, uh, we, uh, have two pregnant women. One of 'em is
She--she's in bad shape. She's pretty beat up.
she might be hard to recognize.
I-I don't know.
what color is her hair? - Brown. R-reddish.
my wife--my wifeis blonde. Brownish, but blonde.
Oh, yeah. Sometimes the bloodmakes it look darker like that, you know, red.
I know you can't tellfrom the photo, but her eyes are

Casey's eyesare very distinctive.
Yeah, brown, but not that really dark, dark brown.
More--more golden and--and--and really warm.

I'm done.
she's my person.

O'malley, I'm working. What do you want?
I read on the boardyou're doing an internal fixationof the lumbar spine on a john doe fromthe ferry crash, age 7.

Oh, honey, mommy's sorryshe got lost.
they could only puta 20-guage I. V.In, but I think it blew.
I'll start a central line, but you have to getout of the way.
we--we put, uh, 3 milligramof epi down the E. T.Tube
the last dose was three minutesago.
we should push-- - shepherd, get out.
I think we should pushjust 1 at-atropine.
I think I saw some reactivity in her pupilsbefore the atropine, and I think she mit have actually had some - cardiac activity-- - shepherd, get out.
we need to putan external pacer onjust to make sure.
we need to save her life.
you can't do this. We need to do this.
now go. one, two...
go.
okay, she has a new 18-guagein her left A. C. Push 1 of epi through it.
the chiefis working on her, man.
he threw me out.

okay. clear.
back to asystole. Keep compressions going.
Oh, my god. - She's hypothermic.
have you trieda warm peritoneal lavage or even a continuousbladder lavage with warm fluids?
you could doa thoracotomy. - Get back the A. B.G.
okay, now let's go, people.
how's her temp?
only up to 81 now. - Come on, meredith. Don't do this.
it's meredith? - Yeah.

but I believemeredith will survive this.
I believe... I believe--I...
I-I believe in the good.
I believe that it's beena hell of a year.
and I believe that in the faceof overwhelming evidce to the contrary, we will all be okay.
I believe a lot of things.
I believe that...
I believe that dennyis always with me.
and I believe that if I eata tub of butter and no one sees me, the calories don't count.

we're losing her.

I know you think I have feelings for you, but I don't.
search and rescue found those lost climbers.
one's still missing.
tell me the truth. Do you remember?
do you know who you are?
he's making his recommendation to the board tomorrow for chief of surgery and chief resident.
you're adopting? - She hasn't actually picked us yet.
this heartburn, it's like it... - Oh, no.
fourth climber. - Is that an ax in his head?
if Richard finds out that you're carrying another man's baby...
somebody help!
being chief is about responsibility.
every single surgical patient in the hospital is you patient, whether you're the one who cut them open or not.
she's lost a lot of blood.
the scalpel stops with you.
start 2 large bore I.V.S and bolus 2 liters L.R.
you need to be able to look at a family...
ready? One, two...
and tell them your team did everything they could to save someone's child...
get me a stat E.K.G. And a portable chest, Brooke.
she's 34 weeks pregnant with twins.
their husband...
you guys, why don't you go have a seat in the waiting room?
we're not leaving her.
their wife.
what happened?
I don't know. I found her unconscious.
you get caught up...
taking care of other people's families.
she's lost blood, a-a lot of blood.
and the responsibility, it makes you...
I didn't even know she was in the hospital.
what was she doing here?
you take care of other people's families, and you sacrifice your own.
I thought I was gonna hate this party game thing, but it's kinda great.
can we set her on fire after?
no, we cannot.
okay, these wedding vows are not all gonna fit on here.
okay, then write smaller. - Be still, please.
"Vow" just became "cow."
you don't need vows on your hand.
when you get up there, just speak from the heart.
uh, Lzzie, the heart is an organ.
it pumps, it circulates blood, it gets clogged from time to time. It does not, however, speak.
it doesn't have tiny little lips on it.
well, you're all "glass" totally empty.
I'm gonna like being married.
it's the wedding party that's ridiculous.
Oh! Party's over. - Damn.
Hey, mine didn't go off.
piece of crap.
you can do this, right?
become a piece of chattel? Sure.
looking forward to it.
I mean, no matter what, you're walking down that aisle today.
I need you to go down that aisle.
is the toilet paper cutting off your circulation?
you marrying burke, it's a sign.
it's a sign that people like you and me can do this, be healthy, be happy.
you marrying burke restores my faith in me.
Oh, I get it.
my wedding's about you.
Yes. - Okay.
you can do this, right?
I can do this. - Okay.
Hey. They found the fourth climber.
vitals are stabilizing after fluids, but I thought he was dead.
he was, according to his friends. Did the C.T. show a bleed?
uh, we haven't done a C.T. yet.
I don't understand. You said there's a head trauma.
Yeah, there's been a little head trauma.
ice ax to the head.
what the hell happened up on that mountain?
that's a good question.
you don't think it could be uterine cancer, do you?
it runs in the family. - No, it's not...
she was in earlier. She was in a fender bender.
my wife came into my hospital, and you neglected to tell me?
doctor-patient confidentiality.
we're still married.
she's unconscious. There are medical decisions to be made.
legally I have a right to know.
I have a right-- - she might be having a miscarriage.
she's pregnant.
I need to know what time your chest pain started.
I don't know. Yesterday afternoon.
what time exactly? This is important.
around 3: 00.
what's wrong with me?
I'm gonna explain everything to you. I promise.
but right now we need to get you up to the surgical floor.
surgery? But...
what about my babies?
I think those babies are coming out today.
but I-I haven't decided. I...
I haven't chosen the parents. I need time to decide.
you don't need to decide anything right now.
right now the most important thing is making sure that you are okay.
all right?
Ah, I've got a surgery, but it shouldn't be more than four hours, five tops.
I can scrub in. - How's Rina?
I need to get a C.T. Angio, but I'm pretty sure it's a tear in her aorta.
her heart is about to blow.
most dissecting aortas burst within 48 hours.
which means we have less than 12 hours to fix it before she's dead.
so you need me to get the babies out.
so I can save her life. - You have an aortic dissection?
Hey, I promise I will make it to the chapel in time.
I...
okay. Listen up.
uh, O'malley, you're with Shepherd and Sloan.
Stevens, you're with Burke.
Karev, Addison. Go.
you are with the chief's wife.
the chief's wife? - Is pregnant.
Yes, I did say pregnant.
I recommend that you lose the shocked look and try for something a little more dignified. Go.
who am I on?
uh, I didn't page you. Go home. Get some sleep.
Yeah, but I'm here already, so...
you're getting married in less than 12 hours.
give us room.
well, uh, Burke's getting married, too, and he gets to operate.
there's only one Preston Burke.
there's only one Cristina Yang.
I've given you the day off, the whole day.
it's a kindness. Take it.
it's your wedding day. There'll always be more surgeries.
but
really, what would you rather be doing, prepping a patient or prepping for your wedding? Go home.
I never got the sense you really wanted the job.
seems to me you got in the race to play out some kind of unfinished business you had with Derek.
I was in this to win, sir.
I don't know if he's your new chief, but if he is, he got there because I made him fight for it.
you made them all fight for it.
so I'm not gonna be chief.
no, you're not.
they recovered Lonnie's body?
not his body. He's alive.
so why don't you tell me what really happened up there on the mountain?
w-we're half way up this ice wall.
there's a...
there's a ledge a couple of hundred feet above us.
we figured we'd set up the tents, wait out the storm.
only Lonnie's insisting we go down the mountain.
I told him, we gotta dig in, sit tight.
he started freaking out, keeps saying down's the way to go.
and then he starts climbing down.
we were tied together.
and just like that-- - we're falling.
I swing out with my ice ax, just trying to catch a rock.
and I clip Lonnie in the back of the head.
ax just snags.
we thought he was dead.
it was an accident.
what happened?
you've been unconscious for a while.
what about... - he knows.
Adele, you lost a lot of blood.
I'm gonna try to find a heartbeat.
you should prepare yourself.
heartbeat.
it's a little slower, than I'd like, but once we tank you with liquids and a transfusion, it might get stronger.
um, I've gotta rush off to surgery, but I will back with you the minute I'm done.
okay? - Thank you.
okay.
Adele, why didn't you tell me?
come on, Richard.
what do you think you would've done, congratulate me?
I'm sure you have work to do.
I'm good right here.
the PEDS resident's on call.
he'll be in the O.R. for Rina's delivery.
great. Just make sure they notified the NICU.
Hi.
sorry for interrupting.
the nurse said that you're Dr. M-montgomery.
Yes. Can I help you with something?
I'm Jeff Pop Rebecca's husband?
Hi, Jeff.
you, uh...
your face...
but it's you.
I'm so sorry, baby.
I should've never let you go.
I'll never let you go again.
Hey. - I have a surgery.
I heard you're the best man.
Yeah.
well, maid of honor, best man, kinda perfect.
Yeah.
I know I haven't been myself lately, but I'm me again, so I was thinking maybe you should sleep over, because the me that I am is horny for the you that you are.
I met a woman last night.
you met a woman last night? - At joe's.
nothing happened.
she was pretty, I noticed, and we talked.
you met a woman last night? - Yeah.
so should I be worried or something?
should you be worried that I met a woman? No.
should you be worried that, for me, flirting with that woman was the highlight of my week?
Yeah, you should be worried or something.
I don't understand.
it's not you. - No, I understand that part.
what I don't understand is why.
I need this job, Richard.
I need it more than the others.
Addison-- - No, I need a reason to stay here.
I need a reason to get up in the morning.
I need to wake up and not care that it's raining or that I'm 39 and alone.
I need the job, Richard.
that's why.
if you need a job to give you a life, you either need a new job or a new life.
I'm thinking four hours tops to repair this heart, if all goes well.
you're a lucky man, Burke.
Cristina's great. She's there, she's sure.
she's willing to commit.
you're a lucky man.
and you're not?
there he is. T-minus five hours.
and how's the best man? Up to the challenge?
I was an excellent best man.
you know, the worst case scenario is I sleep with your wife in ten years.
okay.
I just checked. Chief resident hasn't been posted yet.
um, no, no. I wasn't looking for chief resident.
Yeah, you were.
Yeah. Okay, I was.
George... - hey.
what I'm about to say is, uh, is crazy.
and, uh, I-I-I am not responsible.
I-I am saying this against my will.
because I am a surgeon, okay?
I-I-I love my job.
I love my life exactly as it is.
okay? Exactly as it is.
do you understand what I'm saying?
not really.
I-I have no desire to house a human being in my body for nine long months and then, and then-- and then push it out and raise it. Okay?
none. Zero. - Okay.
except housing a human for nine long months is all that I can think about.
It--it--the thoughts are invading the surgeries that I love, and it's--it's-- it's--it's hormonal.
It's--and horrible.
but it is happening... to me.
you want to have a baby?
apparently.
there's a guy with an ax in his head.
right. So go.
I'm a freak. Just go. Just run.
just... thank you. Please.
go. I'm fine.
take your pill... and drink your water.
Richard, you know you wanna go out that door and start bossing some people around.
take your pill, Adele.
see?
I can do my bossing right from this chair.
go ahead, Richard, ask.
I know you are dying to know whose baby th
not really my place.
Mrs. Webber... your room is ready.
excuse me, but what do you want to do about the announcement for chief of surgery?
look, I will be right back.
I promise.
we've met before.
you probably don't remember.
you were little. Oh.
my husband always flirted with your mother.
I didn't want to see that, so...
I watched you a lot, watched you grow up.
you turned out well.
I'm sorry about your mother.
I'm... sorry about my mother, too.
it wasn't your fault.
maybe it wasn't anyone's fault.
you get married at 25 thinking, this is it, happily ever after.
maybe there is no happily ever after.
it's stunning.
it's a little...
um, is it supposed to be so tight?
well, it's a choker.
it's beautiful.
it's really, really beautiful.
I just don't know if it's me.
five generations of Burke women have worn this on their wedding day.
it's a way of joining our family, becoming a Burke.
a Burke.
I'm afraid I misjudged you early on.
I thought you were selfish.
but you've given way to preston's ideas about the wedding, and you've been flexible about the things that are most important to him.
and that is wonderful.
Oh! It's just...
what were you planning to do about your eyebrows?
N-Nothing.
how's she doing?
B.P.'s 92 over 56.
how'd the reunion go with Jane Doe's husband?
whatever. He cried like a baby. She looked bored.
don't go overboard with compassion, Karev.
she's not even sure if she wants to stay with the guy.
it's complicated - it's not actually...complicated.
they're married. She took a vow.
you don't mess with vows. Married is married.
game over. So freakin' over.
just an opinion.
pressure's dropped to 60.
she's bleeding out. Addison, how much longer?
rupturing the membrane now.
I just need two minutes to get these babies out.
make it one. She's flatlined.
Stevens, start compressions.
got the first one out. Clamp.
come on come on.
second baby's out. Okay, go.
Boki, 10-blade.
poor guy...he just wanted to climb a mountain, and he ends up with an ax in his head.
well, he shouldn't have tried turning back.
the group is going up, you move with the group.
okay, drill, please. - He panicked.
you have a right to turn back if you're scared.
no, you don't. You chose to climb a mountain.
you can't change your mind in the middle of the climb.
okay. Now we pull it out?
Ah, yeah, but the ax went in as they fell, so there will be some tearing, it should be a shallow wound, and it should come out easily.
you ready? - Yup.
all right everybody. Here we go. Ready?
okay, one, two...
that's strange.
that's a clean cut.
I thought you said there was gonna be tearing.
I know. It doesn't make sense.
you are a lucky guy. - Yeah.
or the ax didn't go in there by accident.
it's probably unfair, but I hold you to a higher standard.
and you let me down this year, Preston.
after you got shot, the tremor...
this job is about making the tough calls.
sometime the toughest call you can make is admitting when you're in over your head.
you don't do that.
you know a lot, Preston.
you're one of the best surgeons I know...
one of the best men.
but you're not perfect.
you don't know everything.
I want to give you the job.
I want to.
but I can't.
I have a wedding to get to.
Yeah.
the babies are doing great. They're in the NICU.
how are you doing up there, Preston?
close call, but she's stabilized.
good work, Dr. Burke. We may actually get you to the church on time.
you nervous?
no, not really.
more, uh... excited. Hmm. Um, except by my vows. I wrote them myself, and... I don't know.
they may be too...
I want 'em to be right.
well, let's hear 'em. - What, now?
Hey, you've got a room full of women. Try it out on us.
I could promise to hold you and to cherish you.
I could promise to be there in sickness and in health.
I could say till death do us part.
but I won't.
those vows are for optimistic couples, the ones full of hope.
and I do not stand here on my wedding day optimistic or full of hope.
okay, um...
I am not optimistic.
I am not hopeful.
I am sure.
I am steady.
I know.
I am a heart man.
I take 'em apart. I put 'em back together.
I hold them in my hands.
I am a heart man.
so of this I am sure...
you are my partner...
my lover... my very best friend.
my heart- my heart- beats for you.
and on this day, the day of our wedding, I promise you this...
I promise you to lay my heart in the palm of your hands.
I promise you... me.
too trite? Because I can rewrite it.
no. No. It's...
I think I speak for...every woman in this room when I say dump her.
dump yang and marry me.
Hey.
Hey. - Hey.
Oh, god. Did I miss a page?
no, no, no, no, no. Everything's okay.
what?
is this really what you want?
cause if it's really what you want, we could do it.
Really? - Yeah.
okay, wait. Really? - Really.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Really?
she looks like Rebecca.
well, at least what Rebecca used to look like.
but still... around the eyes.
Yeah.
I thought I'd give her some space.
she seemed a little overwhelmed.
the ferry crash was on the news everywhere.
your wife goes missing... How could you not look for her?
I thought she left me.
we got into a fight that night.
she was trying to tell me how unhappy she was and... I shut her down.
Yeah, I didn't look for her when she was missing, but what's worse is...
I didn't see her when she was there.
I can't imagine what it must have been like for her, what her face must have looked like all broken.
she was beautiful.
I... I love her. You know?
Oh. You are not gonna believe.
Derek met a girl... in a bar.
and he flirted with her. And he told me.
you know, no big deal. Just thought I should know.
Meredith. - I'm not exaggerating.
he didn't even hint. He just flat out told me.
Meredith, you know how sometimes it's about you, and sometimes it's about me?
this is really, really about me.
whoa.
mama took my eyebrows.
she took my eyebrows, and now I am a Burke.
Lonnie's stable...
but the damage he sustained is significant.
but is he gonna wake up?
do you want him to? - What?
the ax in his head was put there deliberately.
I just wanted to give you three guys another opportunity to tell me the truth.
it wasn't. -Shut up, Andy.
but we can't just sit here. -I said shut up, Andy.
is that how you let him talk to you at 14, 000 feet?
I have to talk to his family. You guys can talk to the cops.
announcements Dr. Bailey.
Yeah. What?
Cristina needs to cut something.
I can't really explain it in a way that won't make you glare.
but... they took her eyebrows and they called her a Burke.
she really needs to cut somebody open.
go... do... getting married things.
get out of this hospital.
Hey!
I mean... hey.
I...
you have to let me cut, because I am standing here eyebrowless with no dignity left.
I am a surgeon, Dr. Bailey. But right now I don't feel like one.
I feel... like...
somebody else.
do you know what that's like, not to feel like yourself?
Yeah.
what's going on?
she started cramping and then she got really diaphoretic.
alert O. B. to a possible D&C due to an incomplete miscarriage.
Adele, you could have a placental abruption due to the trauma.
we've got to get you to into an O. R. Now.
sir, Dr. Shepherd is here.
thank you.
Richard, are you sure you want to...
you don't have to do this today.
Yes, I do.
she went into early D. I. C.
I gave her blood, platelets, F. F. P, pregnancy at 52 is dangerous. I tried everything.
I couldn't save...
I thought...
I thought...
for a second, I thought I'd lost you.
um... Do you want to... call somebody? I can...
no, no one.
well, the father of the baby, maybe you want to
he doesn't even know about it. I didn't tell him.
I, um... I think I misjudged him.
I thought he'd go running for the hills. But actually...
he's a much better man than I thought.
he'll get over initial judgments, and he'll...sit with you...
and he'll make you drink your water.
Adele... - it was a boy.
I'm sorry.
all right, Dr. Leonard, would you please close for Dr. Burke?
he has a wedding to get to.
one cut, and then you're gone. One.
but-but I still have to
come on. You want your bride waiting for you at the altar? They don't like that.
let's go.
we gotta go now, Cristina.
Grey. - Put the scalpel down, Cristina.
you can still do this, right?
what?
uh, hold on a minute.
I just wanted to make sure no one's around so I can say this.
I think we've said everything we need to say.
shut up.
I am an optimist.
I am hopeful.
I am not sure.
look, I can do this myself. - Let me speak.
because I'm your best friend and because I love you, if what you want is to be with Callie,
then I will do everything in my power to support you and help you make your marriage work.
but because I'm your best friend and because I love you...
I also have to say... that I'm in love with you.
I'm in love with you.
I can't promise the future, I can't promise perfection because we're us and I'm me and who knows what will happen.
but in my heart...
I am sure.
I'm in love with you, George.
and I hope you're in love with me, too.
say something.
what time is it? - You got 30 minutes.
Oh, crap. I'm gonna be late for my own wedding.
no, you're not.
Dr. Burke asked me to check on you.
let's see. Your, um... your post-op x-rays look good. We'll discuss releasing you.
any change in Lonnie? - Andy?
who are you?
he's my lawyer.
that was fast. Don't you dare judge me.
you weren't there. We thought... he was almost dead. No way he was gonna make it.
he was in so much pain.
so I... picked it up... - Andy, shut up.
No! I'm not gonna shut up.
I put him out of his misery.
and if I was back there right now...
I'd do the same thing.
he was my friend.
he is my friend.
I put him out of his misery.
anyone got any deodorant?
um, you're not putting my deodorant in your hairy armpits.
don't move. You're gonna have a unibrow. And I have some in my locker.
uh, closed? Open?
closed.
perfect. Dashing.
Thanks. - You look great.
moment of truth, people. - Those our scores?
thank you. - Stevens.
O'malley. - Yes!
right here, baby. - Yes. Thank god.
did you pass? - You bet your married booty, I did.
how'd you do? Did you pass?
Yeah.
I'll talk to you at the church. - Okay.
all right. Let's go.
excuse me.
I'll meet you at the chapel. Lz, will you take the dress?
Yes. Okay. - I'll be right there.
okay.
I like the suit. The suit is way better than the scrubs.
Thanks.
Hey, uh, I passed my intern exam.
good! - Yeah.
that's good.
we got discharged, me and the baby.
Oh, come on, you just- you just had brain surgery.
you're still-you're still on antibiotics.
my body's been signed off on by... plastics, cardio, orthopedics, neuro and O. B.,
and my- and also, my teeth got a blessing from
wait, I can say this- prosthodontics.
Yeah, but there's still your memory
you know how I know my memory's fine? Because I can say prosthodontics.
Yeah, but the baby- discharged, by PEDS.
Yeah, but I have every reason to go.
and-and yeah, I'm scared. And yeah, this is-this is moving at warp speed.
and yeah, I'm freaking out, but Jeff is good.
and-and Jeff is the father of my child. The man is out buying a car seat right now.
and the minute he gets back...
I- I have every reason to go, because medically... there's no need for me to stay.
medically.
Oh. Yeah. Okay.
well, then I'll just check the chart.
damn it. - We got, uh... what?
are you... do I-do I have to spell everything out for you?
I mean, did-did you sniff too much glue as a child?
I'm asking you something here.
what do you want from me?
I want...
I want you to give me a reason to stay...
a real reason.
I mean, Jeff's-- Jeff's a decent guy, a good, decent guy.
but to him, I'm Rebecca, and I don't know if I am Rebecca anymore...
and you know me. You knew-you knew when I couldn't even speak who I was.
you... you named me, and I was more me as Ava then I'll ever be as Rebecca.
look, I-I have every reason to go back to my life.
and I will.
Unless...you...
Alex, I'm asking you to give me a reason to stay here...
a reason from you.
Jeff loves you. He's a... he's a decent guy.
Alex, give me a reason.
I think you should stay with the decent guy.
if you want to break up with me so you can see other women, just do it.
don't tell me you met another woman. Just end it if that's what you want.
I can't. -Sure you can.
here's how it goes-- Meredith, I don't want to see you anymore.
Meredith, I don't love you anymore. -Meredith...
I do love you.
don't you see? Don't you understand?
you're the love of my life. I can't leave you.
but you're constantly leaving me.
you walk away when you want, you come back when you want.
not everyone, not your friends, but you leave me.
so I'm asking you...
if you don't see a future for us, if you aren't in this...
please...
please just end it, because I can't. I'm in it.
put me out of my misery
I...I can't. I-I-- Cristina is getting married.
I have to go make sure she gets married.
I really need to make sure she gets down that aisle.
let's go. We're running late.
you okay? -I'm fine. I'm fine.
you need anything? Need a mint, huh? A get-away car?
if it's the chief thing, don't worry about it. You deserve it.
richard didn't pick me to be chief.
we all assumed you...
well, who did he pick? -I don't know. It wasn't me.
you really don't...look so good.
Meredith and I may not make it.
I think I want it more than she does.
but today's your day. It's all about you today.
you really are a good best man. -I try.
Cristina? -I didn't run.
Oh! -You look beautiful.
I'm proud of you. -Thank you.
frankly, I always feared you were too emotionally stunted to settle down.
you can do this.
I've always found it confusing.
if you know both the bride and the groom, which side do you sit on?
I just look for the hottest chick in the room and sit next to her.
stop. - Wanna ditch the reception, grab a drink instead?
stop it.
you don't want me. -Maybe I do.
no, you don't.
you want Ava. -She's not Ava anymore.
she's Rebecca now, and I barely know her.
look at me. Look at me.
you suck. To me, you suck. I kind of...
hate you. But, Alex, we not get unlimited chances to have the things we want.
and this I know...
nothing is worse than missing an opportunity that could've changed your life.
and no matter what her name is, she'll always be Ava to you.
Dr. Bailey.
you didn't go to the wedding either. -No.
I am...so sorry, George.
so, um...what do I do now?
you fail your intern test, you have two options. You can...
walk away from being a surgical resident altogether, or you can start from the very beginning.
repeat my internship?
no.
I can't.
I can't.
did I...did I fail you, George?
no.
no.
I failed you.
Ooh. It looks so pretty in there. I see Burke.
Yang...the twins looks nice in that dress. -Thank you. Sort of.
I gotta go. I gotta check-- -you're on call?
Oh, wait, Alex. Did you see George in there?
I don't see him. -He's, uh...
probably gonna be late. We had kind of a big, emotional day.
Oh, really? -Yeah.
did something happen between you two? I mean
no. It's just that I was named chief resident.
plus we decided to have a baby, so...
a baby? -Yeah, we're trying.
we tried today, in fact.
Wow. -Yeah. Big day.
okay, this is it.
okay? -Yeah.
you have the bouquet. -Yeah.
I have the ring. -Yeah.
you remember your vows? -Yeah.
I wrote them on my... -Okay.
Oh, my god I scrubbed in.
I scrubbed in, and the vows were on my hand. I scrubbed off my vows.
Oh, okay. Um-- -okay, hello? I-I scrubbed off my vows.
I-I can't--I can't do this. I don't have any-- I don't have anything on my hand!
I should go see what's going on.
well, Cristina wouldn't be Cristina if she didn't need a little push.
there are no words in my head. Okay?
I have no vows. No vows. -It's okay. It's going to be okay.
you know what? Stop saying that! Will you say something else?
like what? -Say something that is gonna help me.
okay, okay!
I... -Meredith, please. You know what? Say something.
say--you know what? I don't know what. Say--say--okay.
say what I would say to you if you were me.
okay. -Good.
got it. -Good, go.
stop whining. This is your wedding day.
you will go down that aisle and you will get married.
if I have to kick your ass every step of the way to get you there, you will walk down the aisle.
you will get married. Do you hear me, Cristina?
we need this. We need you to get your happy ending.
okay, I'm ready. -All right, then.
my train.
I'll go.
Oh. I'm ready. I'm fine.
I-- Meredith talked me down. Really, I'm fine.
go, go, go. I'll be right behind you.
I'm sorry.
Oh...I can do this.
you know, I had a momentary freak out, but now I'm fine. I can do this. Go.
but you don't want to do this.
I'm up there waiting for you to come down the aisle, and I knew you don't want to come.
I know you don't want to come but that you'll come anyway because you love me.
and if I loved you-- if I loved you, not the woman that I'm trying to make you be, not the woman that I hope you'll become, but you--if I did...
I wouldn't be up there waiting for you.
I would be letting you go.
I am wearing the dress. I'm ready.
and--and maybe I didn't want to before, but I want to now.
I really think I want this.
and I really wish that you didn't think.
I wish that you knew.
it's over.
you can all go home. It's over.
it's so over.
he's gone.
I-I-I don't think he's gone.
uh, his stuff is here. -No, it isn't. His trumpet was here.
his entire Eugene Foote collection-- vinyls and cds...
his grandmother's picture was by the bed.
his lucky scrub cap was hanging on the door.
he's gone.
I'm...
I'm free.
damn it.
damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
Oh, god. Get this off me. Take this off! Take this off!
please, just...
I can't...
help me, help me, help me!
Ah, nice.
do we get assigned lockers here or what? -Dude, it stinks in here.
what do you want? It's a locker room. -No, it's our locker room.
you guys, look, bloody scrubs.
Hi. -Hi.
come on, you guys. Let's, um, -let's go check out the cafeteria. -yeah.
Hey. -Hi.
we're the new interns. -Yeah.
well, you look seasoned and wise. Um...got any advice?
no.
learn how to do an appendectomy start to finish before your first day.
you're leaving? -Yeah.
better offer? -Just, uh...
you know, life. -Yeah.
anyways, uh, good luck with...life, doctor...
my name is George. -I'm Lexie. Lexie Grey.
Congratulations. You'll make a fine chief.
Derek? -I'm not the best man for this job.
you're the best man for this job. -What are you talking about, Derek?
a good chief learns from his mistakes. I'm still working on that.
but you...
if you had a chance to do it all over again, you'd do it differently.
go ahead.
do it all over again.
be the best man.
I'm in love with you, George, and I hope you're in love with me, too.
I was named chief resident.
I've failed my intern test.
you can start from the very beginning.
repeat my internship?
I met a woman last night. - Hi.
you met a woman last night?
I'm Lexie. Lexie Grey.
he's gone.
I can't leave you, but you're constantly leaving me.
it's over...so over.
innovation is everything.
nothing remains the same for long.
we either adapt to change...
or we get left behind.
I have five rules. Memorize them.
rule number one, don't bother sucking up.
I already hate you. That's not gonna change.
trauma protocols, phone lists, pagers. The nurses will page you.
you answer every page at a run-- a run. That's rule number two.
you're supposed to follow me.
your first shift starts now and lasts 36 hours.
you're grunts, nobodies, the bottom of the surgical food chain.
you run labs, you write orders, you work every second night until you drop, and you don't complain.
on call rooms. Sleep when you can, where you can.
you know, but not with anybody.
not attendings-- especially not attendings.
sleeping with attendings-- not a good idea.
where was I?
um, rule number three.
if you're sleeping, do not wake you unless a patient's actually dying.
the dying patient better not be dead when I get there, because not only will you have killed someone, you will have woken me for no good reason. Are we clear?
yes? - That was four rules. You said five.
rule number five-- when I move, you move.
go!
I hate them. You don't hate them. You hate you.
that was hideous. I feel like a fraud.
I rocked it. I think I'm the new Nazi.
Oh, you are not the new Nazi.
Meredith, I need to talk to you.
George. Hi. - Hey.
how was your vacation? - Um, fine.
um, Meredith, can we - Cause mine was...
I didn't do much. I hung out alone...for 17 days.
which is the last time that I saw you, the day of Cristina's wedding, which was...well...
then Mer and Cristina went on Cristina's honeymoon without me.
girl-on-girl honeymoon.
and then Alex took a road trip to see Ava without me.
I did not go to see Ava. And her name's Rebecca.
and I didn't go see her. I just drove in that direction.
Oh, why is everyone so tingly and hurt?
I mean, I'm the one who was left at the altar.
I'm fine, by the way.
I honeymooned in Hawaii and I snorkeled.
What'd you do, George?
um, Meredith... - I - I really need to talk to you.
uh, hey, you want to know
Hey, um, this is for residents only. No interns.
Yeah. - Yeah, get outta here.
babies. - Yeah, go away.
007's in training.
seriously.
I guess I should be going, too.
no, George. We didn't mean you.
no, I'm an intern. - Wait. What did you want to tell me?
uh, is this how it's gonna be all year?
because Bambi has got to learn how to cope.
at least he came back.
Yeah, cut him some slack.
dude, he failed his exam and got left back in kindergarten.
Mm-hmm.
he won't even look at me.
have you seen Burke?
no. Have you seen Derek?
no.
wait, you haven't seen either of them since the wedding?
Nope.
and you're all fine?
Yep - Wow.
you're either incredibly healthy or completely messed up.
your interns are back from holiday today.
uh, not my interns. They're residents. I'm free.
right. Well - Here, nurse. The point is, uh, Dr. Yang.
the Burke thing - She doesn't know.
I'm supposed to tell her.
Burke asked me to tell her. Any thoughts?
honesty always works best. - Yeah, that's true.
you want to get together for a drink after work tonight?
Why? - Well, I don't know.
I just thought it might be a good idea to get together and have oh, you don't have anybody to talk to.
no, I have people to talk to.
Addison is gone, Burke isn't around, and you and Grey aren't smelling each other in the elevators anymore.
I have people to talk to. - Who?
I have...chief.
I-I have the chief to talk to. Hey, chief.
want to get together for a drink after work?
I don't drink. Dr. Bailey, we need to talk.
we have traumas coming in. - You're avoiding me. We need to talk.
about you choosing Dr. Torres to be your chief resident over me?
respectfully, no, sir. We're not going to talk about that.
someone mention a drink later? Cause I'm in.
nobody mentioned a drink. - You mentioned a drink.
I did not mention a drink.
all right, people. We've got three M.V.C.S rolling in back-to-back from a multicar pileup.
we need every trauma room open and everyone suited up.
is there anything I-I should do, sir?
save lives. - No. I mean as, uh, chief resident.
anything in particular?
make sure your residents run their traumas.
this is their first day on their own.
Where...are the residents you've assigned to this E.R?
Oh. Oh, I, uh, I, uh, I paged them. I - I paged them.
Bailey? - What?
uh, I, uh, paged, uh, Grey, Yang, Stevens and Karev, but they're not here yet.
when I page 'em, they come running.
get it together, Torres.
Yes, sir.
okay, you did not have to say that in front of the chief.
you asked...boss.
there's Derek.
is Burke with him? - I don't see him.
where have you been? We have multiple M.V.C.S due any second.
we're here, aren't we? We're here.
just - just get ready, okay? And monitor your interns.
okay, one, two, go get stat packs.
uh, three, four, go meet the ambulances.
one and two? - No, I can't remember their names.
I don't respond to being called a number.
George, go wait for the ambulance.
the rest of you come with me.
all right, you guys stand against the wall and out of the way unless I call for you.
okay, this is what's called a trauma situation.
so there's gonna be lots of activity and a lot of patients, so if you guys have any questions at all, just ask, okay?
I heard she, like, freaked out and killed a guy and had to go on probation.
great. We're stuck with a dud.
so, hey, you're an intern...again.
Yeah.
I won't tell anybody. The other interns - I won't- - that's-that's okay.
do you know which one is Meredith Grey?
Yeah, I haven't, uh, told her you're here yet. I was going to...
so you know who I am?
Yeah, I know who you are.
what's she like? I-I mean, is she nice?
Cause-cause my dad, he won't-he won't tell me. Is sh-sh...
uh, Grey, don't let them just stand here.
let's move, people.
unrestrained driver, D.O.A. at the scene.
just need someone to pronounce him.
Oh, crap. Dead guy. Why'd you get me all excited with the sirens?
okay, who wants to see a dead guy?
Nancy Walters, 34 years old, weeks pregnant. Complete upper arm amputation.
pressure dressings applied. Two large bore I.V.S started.
did he say "arm"? My arm is gone?
miss Walters, you're gonna be okay. Grey, check the wound.
I really need my arm.
45-year-old male, sustained a knee injury.
that guy, the guy that's dead, he hit a deer, and then the lady hit him, and then I hit the lady.
knee is blowing up like a balloon.
Hey, I'm hungry. Can I get something to eat?
okay, everybody get a good look? Time of death -- 8: 22.
not time of death. This guy is not dead.
he was dead. - Well, he's not dead now.
let's bag him. Okay, we've got a
we've got a guy who's risen from the dead over here.
get outta the way!
are - are you Meredith Grey? - Yeah.
I--I'm Lexie. - Great. Move.
Lexie Grey. I'm--I'm your sister.
that girl out there, the dopey, wide-eyed one?
apparently we're related.
Oh, you--you met Lexie?
Oh, you knew. Knew about it and didn't tell me, huh?
I've...kind of had a lot things on.
this is trauma room one. As you can see, it's
there's a trauma.
Hey, guys, do you need some help? Please tell me you need some help.
it's a little crowded in here already, Iz.
what do you got for me?
uh, Nancy Walters. Complete amputation.
the baby looks fine, but she's having some contractions.
Hi, Nancy. I'm Dr. Sloan. You mind if I take a look?
it's a clean cut.
you want to rub up against me, you gotta buy me a drink first.
hang antibiotics and put on a sterile, moist dressing.
there's a chance at a good recovery here.
do we have an arm?
they're looking for it.
my baby has no father. He's already down two arms.
so he r-really needs me to have an arm.
get me that arm.
okay, somebody set up for a traumatic effusion drainage.
Ah...
and order him 4 of morphine.
she means one of you morons.
get her an 18 gauge needle and a 20 cc syringe and the damn morphine.
Hey, uh, morphine's cool, but I'd kill for something to eat.
a healthy appetite after a trauma like this?
that's a very good sign, Joey.
you think he'll need surgery?
that depends on the x-rays.
knee looks good. No surgery.
okay. This is Cristina -- Dr. Yang.
she's working.
Yep, saving lives and taking names.
so...I have these interns and nothing to do.
and, uh, I think I'm a really bad teacher.
and I think they hate me. And now I'm a fraud.
so any chance you wanna let me in on this? Please.
Izzie, this guy was dead, and now he's undead.
so that kinda makes him like a zombie my personal zombie. So no, you can't get in on this.
now go be a...fraud somewhere else.
I don't like you. - Mm-hmm.
let's go, people. - Excuse me.
you know, where have you been? I've been waiting for these.
I got -- I was -- I met my sister, uh, for the first time ever...
Oh, hey. Which, uh, got me, you know, weird.
so then I got, um, lost on my way to x-ray 'cause I was all in my head, you know, about -- about meeting Meredith.
Meredith is your-- is your sister?
Meredith Grey. Lexie Grey. We're half sisters. So you know her?
Oh, we need to page Dr. Shepherd.
Dr. Shepherd. He -- he's the, um... neurosurgeon?
okay, somebody page Derek Shepherd right freakin' now.
Grey. Thank you.
Seattle Grace.
thank you.
Hi. How are you?
I have a patient with a severed arm and no one seems to be able to find it.
have you seen it?
your severed arm? No, I haven't seen a severed arm.
Meredith, how - hey, um, I'm--I'm so sorry about before.
I just was so nervous about meeting you.
don't block the E.R. Doors. I know that now.
that was a good lesson.
you're the girl from the bar. - Sorry?
the girl from the bar?
Oh, my god. Yeah. Oh, my god. Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, my god. you--you work here.
Yeah, I do.
girl from the bar? - Mm-hmm.
I'm the girl from the bar.
uh...She hates me. My sister hates me.
Meredith is your sister? - My half sister, yeah.
Hey, uh, you're Dr. Shepherd. - That's right.
I'm--I'm supposed to be finding you for a consult.
Hey. There you are. I missed you this morning.
Yeah, I didn't want to be late for my second first day as an intern.
maybe you can look at it like this -- you have one up on everyone.
you're gonna be, like, the rock star intern.
Yeah, I'm sure that's how everyone's gonna see me when they find out.
or maybe they'll see you as the daddy intern.
what?
wh-what did you just say?
Oh... I'm not -- I'm not pregnant. I just...
I mean, I might be pregnant.
Yeah, my boobs are a little sore, which...
Hey, I'm trying to cheer you up here, George.
this is -- I mean, if I am knocked up, that's a good thing, right?
Callie, I'm just a little distracted. I'm having a bad day.
okay, you're having a bad month.
okay, I'm having a bad month.
love you.
help! We need doctors. Help! - Inside voice.
uh, we found an arm in the road.
here, I bagged that - that's my arm.
dad, dad, tell them she's hurt! Dad, come on.
tell the doctor! Tell 'em she's hurt.
uh, any way we can go with the severed arm? - She's in the truck, and she's hurt.
is that your blood? Are you hurt?
she's in our truck, and she's not moving.
she's bleeding really bad.
there's another crash victim.
we're gonna need gloves, I.V.S, gauze, ab pads, trauma gowns.
still want to babysit the arm?
come on
no way.
is she dead?
Michael, this is a hospital, and I'm a people doctor. I...
can you save her? - Michael, come on.
I'm sorry, but she's - roadkill.
she opened her eyes. Look. She's still alive!
Oh, god. Don't look at me like that. Or like that.
Michael, let's go back to the truck. Come on.
please.
Oh, okay, all right. All right.
uh, I'm gonna need a jumbo catheter, a 16 gauge needle, the biggest ambu bag you can find and something that shaves fur.
what's the matter with you people? When I say move, you move. Move!
back of his skulls completely disconnected from his first cervical vertebrae.
he's been internally decapitated. Holy crap.
Yeah, 90% of these die in the field.
and the other 10%?
I've never seen one live.
there's always a first time, though, right?
I mean, he came back from the dead.
Henry, I'm Dr. Shepherd.
the back of your skull is disconnected from your spine.
I'm gonna try and reconnect it in surgery.
do you understand me?
blink once for yes, twice for no.
okay, good. I know it's scary, but I promise you, I'm gonna do everything I can.
do you have family?
all right. We're gonna contact them, okay?
all right, let's get him in a halo. - uh-huh.
contact his family. Find out if he's an organ donor.
you, finish up with the splint, then get him up on crutches.
Hey. How's joey?
it's a hungry hippo missing a kneecap.
can't you assign me something good?
I don't switch out patients, Karev.
but it's not even surgical.
it's a waste of my skills.
you're staying here with Joey. - Come on.
No! - Fine. I'm going to Bailey.
you are a resident. You go where I say.
my arm is gone.
we have the arm, and Dr. Sloan checking right now to see if we can reattach it.
is there someone we can call?
there's no...no, I just...I just moved here.
I'm all-- I'm all by myself. There's no one. I have no one.
well, Dr. Sloan should be here any minute.
I wanted a kid and...
I was sick of waiting for the right guy, so...
in my family...
in my family, you don't go out and get pregnant.
so now I'm alone and...
I'm having a baby, and I don't have a father for the baby, - and I don't have an arm. - It's okay.
here's Dr. Sloan.
Nancy...I'm happy to report that your arm is in good shape.
Dr. Grey here is gonna clean it up a little, and
and I'm gonna put that arm back where it belongs, okay?
okay.
okay.
we got a 150-pound female with...
lacerations on the chest and haunches, short, fast breaths.
any recommendations?
uh, doctor, Michael's a big boy.
he doesn't need you to perform make-believe medicine, right, Michael?
it's not make-believe. She can help.
Michael, enough. I apologize. We're just wasting your time.
no kidding.
Michael. - Please don't let her die.
Michael, it is a deer.
we're gonna take her home and skin her and freeze the meat, okay?
what? Why?!
because that's what you do. You don't try and save 'em. You eat 'em.
no, dad. The doctor can save her.
no, she can't. - You don't know that.
my son needs to learn to grow up and face things.
you're right. I am not helping him.
I'm helping Bambi.
so get me the ambu bag and the sane. I'm starting an I. V.
thank you.
still no sign of Burke. Oh, you've got a severed arm.
my arm. Mine. Get away from it.
maybe he's not on today.
maybe you should just see him and get it over with.
no, no, no, no.
if I never see him again, I won't care.
well, I've seen Derek, and Derek has seen me.
And? Awkward. Plus he seems to know Lexie.
And?
more awkward. Your intern is my half sister.
how weird is that?
well, I'm trying to save Bambi's life.
my interns think I'm a loser.
severed arm. - Callie's a bitch.
word. - She won't let me off my patient, and there's nothing wrong with him except he's a nut job.
severed arm.
does anybody know anything about deer?
ey taste good.
evil.
Oh, George, severed arm.
plus Mer's half sister is my intern, Izzie is playing Dr. Dolittle, oh, and Alex hates your wife.
Dr. Sloan's ready for the arm.
I'll say it. - George is being an ass.
I think it's my fault.
I said some things, and now he's not talking to me.
I don't know what he's got to complain about.
those new chick interns are hot.
he's married, Alex. - Yeah, he's married.
you know who's seriously hot? That Lexie girl.
get out...before I hurt you.
I'm going over Callie's head to Bailey.
uh, Callie is over Bailey's head.
spiritually, Bailey's over everyone's head.
Dr. Bailey. How are things go?
I wouldn't know. Ask Dr. Torres.
Miranda - I don't want to talk.
Miranda, it is not like you not to want to talk.
fine. How's your wife?
well, she's...she's...good.
I haven't moved back in yet.
she hasn't let me move back in yet.
she's not taking my calls. Wait.
that's not what I want to talk to you about.
I want to talk about chief resident.
now we're gonna have this conversation.
are you ordering me to stand here and talk to you about this, chief?
no, I'm not ordering you.
but I just thought we could - okay, then. Good-bye, sir.
I talked to the family they're on their way.
good, put an entire O. R. on hold. We don't have much time.
uh, can I get a progress note?
uh, do you maybe want to have a drink later?
what? - A drink.
give me one reason why we can't hang out.
I don't like you.
you don't like me because of Meredith?
I don't like you because you're you.
hmm. How is Meredith, by the way?
is she okay?
she's fine.
she's always fine. That's her problem.
we're fine people. We do fine. We're fine.
how's Dr. Burke? I haven't seen him around.
is--is he off today?
here.
Dr. Burke handed in his letter of resignation two weeks ago.
he wanted me to tell you.
he's g-gone?
I'm sorry.
well, don't be. I'm - fine?
Yeah.
circulatory system of a deer? - Shut up.
Oh, Dr. Bailey.
uh, couldn't you use an extra set of hands in the O. R. today?
I saw an appy on the board. I'm--I'm great at appys.
talk to Torres. She's in charge of what case you get now.
it's hard to set a shattered kneecap when your patient's in the pit, don't you think?
whatever.
I don't know how you did it.
did what?
get 'em to listen to you, to give you some respect.
Hey, Dr. Bailey, you wouldn't happen to know anything about, uh, the anatomy of a deer?
not my intern, not my business, not anymore.
your husband's injuries are s-severe.
uh, they're traumatic in the extreme.
I'm sorry. What does that mean?
the only thing holding his head on to his body is skin and muscle.
if he moves even a fraction of an inch, it could kill him.
s-so are you saying that the
I'm--I'm saying that when you see him, this could be the last time.
this could be the last time you see him alive.
are you in pain, sweetie?
good.
two blinks-- you aren't in pain.
why isn't daddy answering?
just-- right now we just need to wish daddy good luck in his surgery and tell him how much we love him. Okay?
cause we do.
I love you so much, Henry.
what's--what's three blinks?
uh, we've only been working with one and two.
is it "I love you"?
are you telling us you love us?
three blinks is I love you.
we're gonna be fine, Henry.
you're gonna make it, and we're all gonna be just fine.
it's time to go.
okay, guys. Let's let these doctors fix daddy up.
why are you avoiding me?
I'm on my way to surgery.
no, I don't mean right now. I mean.
not one word in 17 days?
I tell you that I love you, and not one word? Where have you been?
I've been right here.
you know where? Exactly where I was a year ago.
I'm sorry.
I--I'm freaking out.
I'm an intern again.
Yeah, we're all freaking out.
we're all freaking out.
I'm in charge of a group of interns who think I'm crazy.
and I might actually be crazy, because day one of me being in charge, and I'm obsessed with rescuing bambi.
we're all freaking out.
since when did you start calling me bambi?
what? - I'm not calling you bambi.
no, I mean, I know I-I-- I under-- I expect it from Cristina or Alex, - but- - I'm bambi.
I'm bambi, George, okay?
if anyone in this situation is a sad little cartoon character, it's me.
I'm all alone in the forest-- all alone in the forest, George
and my mother's been shot by a hunter, and where are you?
where the hell are you?
I'm on my way to surgery.
I really am up for a drink, you know?
if you, uh, need to talk.
what would I need to talk about?
you were lucky, man.
that girl jerked you around.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, I'm just.
seemed like you could use a friend about now.
Meredith's mother never wanted her.
and her father was never man enough to hang around.
she has a right to be damaged, and us, together, it's a big step for her.
her best friend gets left on the altar, and all she sees now is things like this, they don't work.
she panics.
she wants this.
she doesn't know how to have it.
and you know what?
that's not her fault.
so don't ever talk to me about Meredith Grey again, because you do not know what you're talking about.
and I don't need a friend.
okay, Nancy, I want you to count back from a hundred, okay?
no.
no. I'm not ready.
it's just like going to sleep.
I can't do any of this alone.
I don't want to be alone anymore.
I know.
no, I'm scared. - I know.
I am scared, Meredith.
I know.
I think it's very brave, what you're doing.
it's much better to be alone and feel like a success than to be in a relationship and feel like a failure all the time, right?
that's what I think.
so let's just take care of your arm, and then we'll deal with the rest later, okay?
well, it looks like I'm back to babysitting.
what the hell? Who took my clamps and the bandage scissors?
there's a foreign body.
his abdomen's rigid.
somebody page Dr. Bailey right now.
go!
come on, Joey.
you like hamburgers, don't you?
Yeah.
and spaghetti with meatballs, and lasagna?
that's beef.
that's cow you're eating, son.
what do you mean?
could we have the "circle of life" lesson later?
I need to get in here.
sorry.
her eyes are glassy.
you, get in here and ventilate.
we're losing her.
this is absolutely childish and ridiculous.
no, it's not.
it's not childish to hold on to hope.
it's actually hard-- very, very hard.
your son just wants to believe that some things can work out for the best.
get me the paddles.
come on, come on, come on.
what's she doing?
insuring we never see the inside of an O. R. this year?
she's in v-fib. I'm gonna shock.
charge to 300 and stand back.
okay, clear.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. She's alive?
it worked. She's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, my god.
got a big bleeder.
Dr. Grey, press and hold right here.
she's having contractions.
well, take a look, George.
probably the stress.
no, these are strong, and they're two minutes apart.
call O. B. and get someone in here.
uh, I don't think there's time to call O. B.
her water just broke, and she's crowning.
call peds. Get a warmer in here.
this baby's coming now.
O'malley, get her up in stirrups.
can we put her in a reverse Trendelenburg, have one of the nurses press her abdomen since she can't push?
try it without all the jostling.
I'm holding on to a major artery here.
okay, clamp.
scissors.
I got it.
I got him.
great job, George.
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, we're all heroes.
now if no one minds, I'd like to get this woman's arm sewn on.
like she said, she's gonna need it.
I'm starting the fusion now.
did.
he just move?
Oh, he d-- he definitely moved.
the anesthesia's light.
yang, stabilize his neck. - Okay, three, come and grab his feet.
go under the drape and do not contaminate the sterile field.
we need to keep him very still until he is under.
we can't risk even the slightest movement.
you cannot move.
do you hear me?
this is not an option.
everything is not gonna be fine if you move.
it will be the opposite of fine.
you cannot leave the people you love. They need you.
not just the memory that you love them.
anyone care to explain to me how my patient wound up in this O. R.
and I wasn't even informed?
Karev?
ten minutes ago, this patient was coding from a perforated abdomen.
under the circumstances, Dr. Karev's quick thinking is the reason that your patient is even still alive.
I'll expect a fully dictated chart before you leave tonight, Karev.
Ah, jackpot.
did he swallow those?
poor fool. He must suffer from pica, an uncontrollable urge to eat any and everything.
check it out-- a buffalo nickel.
Dr. Bailey, I saw you were scrubbed in.
I thought I'd stop by and see what you've got.
what I've got?
$2. 37, sir. in change.
it like a cute festival in here.
I delivered that one an hour ago.
Oh, my god.
w-- why aren't you, like, jumping up and down?
I've done this before.
look, George, you didn't pass your intern test.
you know, it--it happens.
it's--it's nobody's fault.
right?
it's nobody's fault.
Yeah, it's just that Callie gave Cristina the study cards, and Meredith didn't write anything down, and Cristina was planning a wedding, and Izzie
Izzie just had to.
you know, I'm--I'm-- I'm responsible.
I've always been the responsible one.
I'm not saying, "what about me?"
I'm not saying, "when do I get what I want?
when do I get to be someone other than the guy who repeats his intern year?
I'm not saying that, but- - but what about you?
Yeah!
I didn't plan on being here.
I was all set for an internship at Massgen.
and then my mother gets the hiccups, and I'm at a funeral.
you know, we all have problems.
moms die, and dads drink so much that they don't even know what year they're in, and sisters--I
I didn't even know that there was a Meredith Grey until a couple of months ago.
and she won't--she doesn't even want to talk to me.
I don't want to be here.
you know, I.
I'd giving anything to not be here.
you know, to--to have my life work out the way I planned, to even have time to ask, "what about me?"
so you--you change.
you--you get over it.
I'm here now, so.
and you.
you delivered a baby today.
so.
stop feeling sorry for yourself.
you.
are kind of awesome.
I know.
thank you.
now whether you like it or not, you and I are gonna talk.
Chief- - I know you're angry and disappointed.
no, I'm not angry.
I'm not disappointed.
I'm speechless.
I don't want to talk because I am speechless.
it makes me speechless to realize you didn't think that.
I would've made an-- an excellent chief resident.
you're right.
you would've made an excellent chief resident.
but you'll make an even more excellent surgeon.
you belong in the O. R. Bailey.
focus on honing those skills, not on how well you can juggle schedules or fill out paperwork.
believe me, I know.
you'll thank me for this one day.
but not today.
I'm the one that could use a friend.
I said that you could use a friend. I could use a friend.
look, Mark-- no, I didn't come to Seattle for Addison.
I didn't come to Seattle to be chief.
I came to Seattle for you, okay?
I came to Seattle to get you back.
I know. I want to take it back now, but I already said it, so.
maybe we should have a drink.
we could.
Yeah. Not today.
I know you didn't wake up this morning expecting this was how your first day was gonna go.
you thought you'd get to reattach an arm or observe brain surgery.
instead you helped save the life of a deer.
you can bitch and complain about it, or you can adjust your expectations.
cause like it or not, you're stuck with me.
and I'm the kind of doctor who lets a little kid convince her she can do the impossible.
Oh, plus, when I woke up this morning, I thought today was gonna go a lot differently, too.
I thought I was gonna get the good interns.
instead I get stuck with the duds.
so I have to adjust my expectations as well.
what? - We heard
we heard you delivered a baby today.
on your very first day as an intern.
Yeah.
what was it like? - Did you do it all by yourself?
was it just like-- did your head just explode with the amazingness?
your very first day.
it was pretty cool.
he came out really fast.
I had to, uh.
you know, determine the position of the cord.
you know what a reverse Trendelenburg is?
I filled this entire bag with coins from my patient's stomach today.
no kidding?
I miss Rebecca.
I miss Burke.
want some money?
change.
we don't like it, we fear it.
what?
you want to humiliate me some more?
cause I get it. I suck.
I suck at my job.
I suck as a wife.
I suck all around, so.
go ahead. Humiliate me some more, please.
hope tomorrow's better.
but we can't stop it from coming.
Meredith.
or we get left behind.
I, um.
you're not ready for no.
I asked for too much.
I think so.
so this is it?
Yeah.
we're breaking up.
we're breaking up.
it hurts to grow.
anybody who tells you it doesn't is lying.
we're broken up.
it's done.
so a breakup kiss.
a breakup kiss.
and some breakup sex.
Yeah, breakup sex.
but here's the truth.
sometimes the more things change, the more they stay the same.
and sometimes--oh, sometimes change is good.
I love you, too.
sometimes change is.
everything.
surgeons AREN'T KNOWN FOR BEING WARM AND CUDDLY.
they're ARROGANT, IMPATIENT...
mean AS OFTEN AS NOT.
okay, YOU CAN GO WITH STRAIGHT-UP CHEMO
and IMMUNOTHERAPY.
the SURVIVAL RATES ARE PRETTY LOW,
but THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH METASTASECTOMIES.
we COULD PROBABLY JUST, YOU KNOW, CUT THIS THING OUT-- SHH. SHH. SHH.
you'd THINK THEY WOULDN'T HAVE FRIENDS, 'CAUSE WHO COULD STAND THEM? - WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?
nothing. IT'S JUST WORK STUFF. - WHAT IS THAT, A COOL SURGERY?
no, IT'S NOTHING. I SAID IT'S NOTHING. WELL, WHATEVER IT IS, THEY'RE GONNA PICK ME.
I ALREADY FLEW SOLO. YOU'RE STILL ON TRAINING WHEELS.
are YOU SURE YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO TELL HIM?
Yes, I'M SURE.
okay, LOOK, UH, I RESEARCHED A TON OF INFORMATION HERE.
you SHOULD READ ALL OF THIS BEFORE YOU SEE THE ONCOLOGIST.
when IS THAT? I CALLED DR. GOLDING,
and, UH, HE GAVE ME A DIRECT REFERRAL TO SWENDER.
so I'M GONNA TRY AND GET YOU IN TODAY. SHH. SHH.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE? I TOLD YOU I WAS FINE. OH, GOD. YOU ARE SO NOT FINE.
I'd BE FINE IF I KNEW DEREK WAS FINE. MM.
why, YOU STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM, NO WORD?
Izzie, UM... DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD CALL IN SICK TODAY?
what? WHY? BECAUSE THIS IS A LOT OF READING,
and YOU'RE SICK. SHH.
you GUYS COMING? BIG SURGERY TODAY. YEAH.
IZZIE-- JUST...
but SURGEONS ARE LIKE A BAD COLD,
nasty BUT PERSISTENT.
chief, I NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT
uh, SLOAN. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM DEREK?
no.
Oh, I'M SORRY.
uh, YOU WERE SAYING-- OH, MEREDITH.
no, I DON'T KNOW HOW HE IS. I HAVE HEARD NOTHING.
nothing TODAY, NOTHING YESTERDAY
and NOTHING THE DAY BEFORE THAT. - You
and NO, I WILL NOT GO BACK OUT THERE.
Hey. WHO MOVED MY SURGERY?
chief? CHIEF?
don't. JUST DON'T. HE'S A WRECK.
he's DISINTEGRATING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES.
that's WHY MEN DIE EARLIER THAN WOMEN.
Yeah. WELL, THE BOARD'S A MESS. - HE CAN'T LOSE SHEPHERD.
I MEAN, I'D GO TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM,
but I JUST GOT TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE.
have YOU TRIED CALLING HIM? - ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES.
no.
N--OH, YOU... YOU WANT ME TO GO TO THE WOODS?
no. I-I DON'T DO WOODS.
the WOODS ARE DIRTY AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY BUGS.
what AM I GONNA SAY TO THE GUY?
I BARELY KNOW HIM. - YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW HIM. YOU'RE BOTH SURGEONS.
you've BEEN THROUGH THE SAME WAR.
look, JUST REMIND HIM
we've ALL BEEN THERE, WE ALL CAME BACK.
you're KIND OF A BULLY, YOU KNOW THAT?
I WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT DIDN'T WORK SO WELL.
this IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SURGERIES YOU MAY EVER GET ANYWHERE NEAR, SO PLEASE PAY ATTENTION.
the PATIENT IS A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE
who WAS HIT BY A DRUNK DRIVER 12 YEARS AGO.
he SUFFERED SEVERE FACIAL TRAUMA.
he's GOT NO NOSE, NO LIPS.
that's WHY WE'VE DUBBED HIM "BLOWHOLE."
he's HAD NINE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERIES,
none OF WHICH HAVE BROUGHT BACK FULL FORM OR FUNCTION.
this SURGERY HAS ONLY BEEN DONE FOUR TIMES WORLDWIDE,
and ALL OF THE CANDIDATES HAVE TO UNDERGO AN EXTENSIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING
to DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN HANDLE THE PROCESS.
psychological COMPONENTS ASIDE,
this SURGERY HAS A HUGE CHANCE OF REJECTION OR INFECTION.
the PATIENT WILL HAVE TO BE ON IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE,HE'LL BE ON LIFELONG ANTIREJECTION DRUGS,
which PUT HIM AT RISK FOR LYMPHOMA, DIABETES,
hypertension, RENAL FAILURE.
I HEAR THEY CALL THE DUDE BLOWHOLE.
what DID YOU JUST SAY? - NOTHING. I JUST HEARD HE HAD A NICKNAME.
don't TALK ANYMORE,
ever.
holy CRAP.
blowhole IS RIGHT. WHAT'D I TELL YOU?
surgeons
nasty...
aggressive, UNSTOPPABLE
just THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU WANT ON YOUR SIDE
when YOU'RE REALLY SCREWED.
ladies AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS MR. DAVID YOUNG.
today HE'LL BE RECEIVING A FACE TRANSPLANT.
Dr. HUNT AND HIS TEAM
will BE RECOVERING THE DONOR FACIAL GRAFT.
we're REPLACING 70% OF MR. YOUNG'S FACE.
you CAN SEE THE DEFICIT HERE. OR HERE.
the DONOR RECOVERY WILL INCLUDE HIS NOSE
left EYE, LIPS, LEFT ZYGOMA.
why WILL ALLOTRANSPLANTATION WORK BETTER THAN TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES? BETTER AESTHETIC OUTCOME,
which ALLOWS FOR REINNERVATION OF THE FACIAL NERVES,
giving A BETTER FUNCTIONAL RESULT.
very GOOD, DR. GREY.
then WE'LL POSITION THE FLAP OVER MR. YOUNG'S FACE.
how DO WE KNOW WHEN WE'RE IN THE CLEAR? - WHEN THE GRAFT TURNS PINK.
excellent.
Dave, ANY QUESTIONS FOR US?
H-HAS ANYONE SEEN THE DONOR?
Yes. HE'S A MATCH
with YOUR AGE, SKIN TONE AND BLOOD TYPE.
what DOES HE LOOK LIKE?
I THINK YOU'LL BE SATISFIED.
who AM I KIDDING? IT'S A FACE, RIGHT?
if I END UP ANYTHING ABOVE A POINT-AND-STARE FREAK,
I'm GONNA CALL IT A SUCCESS.
Karev, YOU'RE WITH ME ON THE DONOR.
usually WE TAKE THEM AT THE SAME TIME,
but THE DONOR'S LIFE SUPPORT IS FADING FAST. WE GOTTA MOVE.
Oh, THANK YOU, SIR. - UH, STEVENS, GREY.
Yes!
no, THE OTHER GREY.
Really? UH, GREAT. - GREAT.
you DID AN AWESOME JOB IN THERE.
why DON'T YOU CALL ME AFTER THE PRE-OP LABS COME IN?
Dr. SLOAN, ONLY ONE RESIDENT?
wait FOR BAILEY. THERE'S ALREADY GOING TO BE ENOUGH OF A CROWD.
what THE HELL?
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TIME TO SCRUB IN WITH SLOAN.
don't WORRY ABOUT IT. I CAN HANDLE IT. - AWESOME JOB.
she PROBABLY QUIZZED HIM IN BED LAST NIGHT. SHE GETS TO WORK ON BLOWHOLE BECAUSE SHE GAVE SLOAN A
shut YOUR MOUTHS!
finish THE CHART. I'LL BE BACK.
I NEED YOU ON PRE-OPS AND POST-OPS.
but THERE'S THE BIGGEST SURGERY IN THE WORLD
happening HERE TODAY.
Yes, AND HALF OUR ATTENDINGS ARE INVOLVED, WHICH IS WHY
we NEED STRONG RESIDENTS ON PRE-OPS AND POST-OPS.
yang, YOU'RE WITH ME TODAY.
you're MOVING TO THE BIG LEAGUES. - WHAT?
she GETS A SOLO? - TODAY?
a NICE OLD LADY WITH A HERNIA. YOU'RE GONNA FIX IT. CONGRATULATIONS.
I KNOW I SHOULD SEEM MORE ENTHUSIASTIC,
but I'M NOT THAT BIG A PERSON.
don't WORRY ABOUT IT.
is IT WRONG TO HAVE HATRED IN YOUR HEART?
good MORNING, MS. SULLY. I'M DR. CRISTINA YANG.
I'll BE PERFORMING YOUR HERNIA REPAIR TODAY.
lovely TO MEET YOU. - DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE GET STARTED?
Oh, YES. CAN YOU HAND ME MY PURSE, PLEASE?
my FRIENDS GAVE ME A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS,
and, WELL, I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY OF THEM, OF COURSE.
they're SUCH WORRYWARTS.
they're ALL OFF ON A EUROPEAN TOUR WITHOUT ME.
they THREATENED NOT TO GO WHEN THIS HERNIA STARTED BECOMING A PROBLEM,
but I TOLD THEM NO, NO.
we HAVE BEEN SAVING UP FOR THIS FOR TWO YEARS.
it HELPED THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET MY DEPOSIT BACK
with A DOCTOR'S NOTE. MM-HMM.
Yes.
no, NO, IT HAS TO BE TODAY.
it's STAGE IV.
no, SHE HAS TO SEE DR. SWENDER,
not--not A PARTNER.
uh... UM, I'M SORRY, MA'AM.
um, I WILL GET TO YOUR QUESTIONS WHEN I COME BACK TO EXAMINE YOU,
okay?
referral WAS GOLDING. GOLDING.
it's A LITTLE EARLY IN THE DAY FOR THAT,
don't YOU THINK?
you SOUND LIKE MY MOTHER.
uh, I MET YOUR MOTHER. I LIKED HER.
who SENT YOU--RICHARD?
of COURSE.
look, I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR PATIENT.
I KNOW HOW HARD IT COULD BE.
I-I HAD A PATIENT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
uh, YOUNG GUY, 50 MAYBE.
simple KNEE REPLACEMENT.
he WAS POST-OP, HE WAS FINE.
I EVEN TOLD HIS WIFE SHE COULD GO AND GET HIM LUNCH.
I MEAN, IT WAS A SIMPLE KNEE REPLACEMENT. IT WAS NOTHING.
but, UH, HE'D BEEN GETTING SHORT OF BREATH,
so I PUT HIM ON BLOOD THINNERS FOR A POST-SURGICAL P. E.
and, UH, IT WASN'T UNTIL HE WAS VOMITING UP DARK RED BLOOD,
looking ME IN THE EYE TELLING ME THAT HE WAS DYING
that I FIGURED IT OUT-- THAT I WAS WRONG.
that IT WASN'T A P. E. HE WAS BLEEDING INTERNALLY.
and IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FATAL, BUT THE BLOOD THINNERS...
God, I WILL NEVER FORGET THE LOOK ON HIS WIFE'S FACE...
when SHE CAME BACK WITH THAT SANDWICH IN HER HAND,
asking ME WHY HER HUSBAND WASN'T IN HIS ROOM ANYMORE.
how DO YOU LIVE WITH IT?
killing HIM...
taking HIM FROM HIS WIFE
how DO YOU LIVE WITH IT?
we CALL IT MALPRACTICE. WE CALL IT A MISTAKE.
Yeah, I KNOW WHAT WE CALL IT.
I'm ASKING YOU, WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING,
how DO YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR?
I'm NOT--I'M--I'M...
I'm ASKING.
can I GET ONE OF THOSE?
Yeah.
it's THE NOT KNOWING THAT DOES IT
not KNOWING IF HE'S OKAY, NOT KNOWING IF HE'S COMING BACK.
maybe I'VE JUST BEEN DUMPED.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT KNOWING IF I'M SINGLE
that MAKES ME WANT TO THROW UP ALL DAY LONG.
you ARE NOT LISTENING TO ME, ARE YOU? - UH, SORRY.
no, NO, THAT'S OKAY. I GET IT.
you've GOT THE SOLO SURGERY AND G. I. JOE.
it's A CHARMED LIFE. YOU DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ME.
I HAVE NOT HAD G. I. JOE. WE'VE KISSED A COUPLE TIMES.
it's LIKE FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS,
without THE BENEFITS.
still NO SEX?
Mnh-mnh. NOT A CHARMED LIFE.
lab RESULTS ON THE SPLENECTOMY.
do WE ASK?
no... 'CAUSE HE MIGHT TELL US.
can YOU IMAGINE?
this GUY'S GOT A FAMILY, RIGHT?
a WIFE, KIDS?
one DAY THEY'RE GONNA BE WALKING DOWN THE STREET
and SEE HIS FACE ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S BODY.
it's KINDA CREEPY, RIGHT?
Mr. YOUNG WON'T LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE DONOR.
the UNDERLYING FACIAL STRUCTURE OF ANY TWO PEOPLE CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT.
Plus, A PERSON'S IDENTITY
is MORE THAN JUST SKIN AND BONE
his EXPRESSIONS, HIS STYLE, HIS EYES.
the DONOR'S FAMILY WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE THIS FACE ON ANYONE ELSE.
transplant SURGEONS ARE GETTING ANTSY.
transplant SURGEONS ARE ALWAYS ANTSY.
they CAN'T RELAX
until THEY'VE GOT LIVE TISSUE IN THEIR COOLERS.
all RIGHT, I AM MAKING THE FINAL DISSECTION.
Karev, TAKE A HOLD RIGHT AT THE TEMPLE
and GENTLY...
don't TEAR THE FLESH.
awesome.
tenderness AROUND THE INCISION IS NORMAL.
no SIGNS OF INFECTION. WOULD YOU REDRESS THAT WOUND?
uh, MEGAN, WILL YOU PLEASE GO TO 20...
go TO ROOM 22-14 AND...
Thanks.
just TAKE OUT THE DRAIN...
when YOU'RE READY? - MM-HMM.
uh, I KNOW IT SEEMS PERSONAL,
and WE WOULDN'T ASK IF WE DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW,
but HAVE YOU PASSED GAS YET?
uh, SORRY,
we CAN'T RELEASE YOU UNTIL THAT HAPPENS
the GAS. I'M SORRY. I'M TRYING TO LISTEN.
but ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE THAT?
like WHAT?
the BLEEDING AND THE SHINER,
and THAT ONE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S SUICIDAL.
they're SUPPOSED TO BE DOCTORS?
we're GONNA RESERVE JUDGMENT ON THAT FOR RIGHT NOW. FREAK SHOW.
just CLEAR THIS UP AND TELL HIM YOU'RE WITH ME. - WHAT THE HECK DO WE DO WITH THEM?
it's NOT THAT EASY. CAN WE SHOVE THEM IN A LOCKER?
Why? WHY ISN'T IT EASY? YOU AND ME, END OF STORY. - I GUESS WE SHOULD JUST TALK TO THEM.
no. WE'RE PROFESSIONALS, AND THAT'S CLEARLY PERSONAL. - YOU TAKE HER FOR GRANTED.
you ARE NOT IN THIS CONVERSATION. BESIDES, WE'LL JUST WASTE TIME.
why IS THIS SO COMPLICATED? YOU CAN'T JUST BULLY HER AROUND.
we'll NEVER GET TO SEE THE SOLO SURGERY OR THE FACE TRANSPLANT. - OH, THAT'S A-- YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
it's OKAY, STEVE. I GUESS, WELL, WE SHOULD-- WE SHOULD JUST IGNORE IT THEN.
it's NOT OKAY. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME? - YEAH, WE SHOULD JUST IGNORE IT.
it's THE PROFESSIONAL THING TO DO.- YEAH, PROFESSIONALLY IGNORE THEM.
it's IMPORTANT THAT YOU TAKE ALL THE MEDICATIONS,
uh, BECAUSE THERE'S A RISK OF
risk OF REJECTION AND INFECTION. I KNOW.
I KNOW. YOU DRILLED IT INTO MY HEAD A THOUSAND TIMES.
and IS YOUR FAMILY HERE YET? I'M--I JUST ASK BECAUSE
someone's GONNA NEED TO TAKE CARE OF YOU AFTERWARDS. I DON'T HAVE FAMILY,
but MY FRIENDS ARE COMING AFTER THE SURGERY.
I'm EXCITED TO MEET THEM AND SHOW THEM MY NEW FACE.
we MET IN AN ONLINE CHAT ROOM FOR ORCHID LOVERS,
and, WELL, UM, WE'VE NEVER ACTUALLY "MET" MET, SO...
Dave, UM, AFTER THE SURGERY,
this DEVICE IS GONNA HELP PREVENT LUNG PROBLEMS
by EXERCISING THE MUSCLES YOU USE TO BREATHE.
I'd LIKE YOU TO PRACTICE ON IT NOW, OKAY? - SIT UP STRAIGHT.
take THREE EASY BREATHS AND THEN BLOW... INTO THAT...
hole.
that's IT.
both OF YOU IN THE HALL, NOW.
you REALLY THINK THAT WAS OKAY?!
you THINK THAT WAS DOCTORLY?! - YOU TWO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.
what THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH YOU?
they WERE MAKING COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE JOKES
at THE EXPENSE OF THE PATIENT RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TEACH THEM,
and THEY WERE CRUEL AND INAPPROPRIATE. OKAY, THEY WERE INAPPROPRIATE.
you KNOW WHAT ELSE IS INAPPROPRIATE? THIS. YOU.
this CASE IS MY BABY.
I've SPENT THREE YEARS PLANNING FOR IT,
and YOU AND YOUR EMOTIONAL LIFE
are NOT ABOUT TO PISS ALL OVER IT.
you're OFF THE CASE. - NO. HE NEEDS ME IN THERE WITH HIM.
you CAN'T LEAVE HIM ALONE WITH THOSE INTERNS.
okay, FINE. YOU WANT TO BE THERE FOR HIS FEELINGS?
you CAN BE THERE BEFORE AND AFTER THE SURGERY.
but YOU'RE NOT COMING IN MY O. R.
and WHATEVER'S GOING ON WITH YOU, - STEVENS,
you BETTER GET IT UNDER CONTROL.
I FOUND THEM.
what? OH, UM, THE, UH, QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SURGERY?
one OF MY FRIENDS WHO WENT ON THE TRIP--BILL FERGUSON. - MM-HMM.
he's A RETIRED SURGEON, AND HE TOLD ME TO ASK YOU THESE,
but I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND MY GLASSES.
my FRIENDS SHOULD BE HERE.
I'm ALWAYS PUTTING MY GLASSES DOWN SOMEWHERE,
and THEY ALWAYS FIND THEM FOR ME-- OKAY,"WILL YOU FINALLY BE ABLE TO PICK UP YOUR GRANDKIDS?"
is--is THIS A QUESTION FROM A DOCTOR?
no. NO, MY OTHER FRIENDS HELPED ME WITH SOME QUESTIONS,
plus I ADDED A FEW ON MY OWN, LIKE, WILL IT HURT?
will IT... HURT?
you'll BE ANESTHETIZED.
Oh, YES, I KNOW THAT.
I MEAN, AFTER, WILL IT HURT?
uh, YOU SHOULD EXPECT NORMAL, POST-OPERATIVE PAIN.
yes?
Yes.
Oh, NO. THAT IS FANTASTIC.
no, I'LL--I'LL TAKE IT. I'LL TAKE IT.
thank YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.
no, I'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH HER RIGHT AWAY.
um, 2:30? ANYTIME IS FINE.
so I'VE COVERED 22-13, 19 AND 33.
Yeah, OKAY. AND I'VE GOT 20-11 AND 20-07.
Mer, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IZZIE.
uh, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW.
all I KNOW IS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG.
well, YOU KNOW, GEORGE,
we're ALREADY DROWNING IN INTERN DRAMA.
we DON'T NEED RESIDENT DRAMA, TOO.
if IT'S A PROBLEM, SHE'LL TELL US.
until THEN, JUST IGNORE IT.
I REPEAT, IGNORE IT.
what IN GOD'S NAME IS GOING ON? - IT'S A PERSONAL ISSUE,
and WE ARE JUST TRYING TO GIVE THEM THEIR PRIVACY.
Oh, DO YOU THINK FOR A SECOND
I WANTED TO GET INVOLVED WITH YOUR LITTLE INTERN DRAMAS?
we WERE NOT THIS BAD. - OH, UH, GETTING MARRIED IN VEGAS,
shaking UP WITH ATTENDINGS, CUTTING L-VAD WIRES?
look, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT, BUT YOU HAVE TO MANAGE IT.
Oh, WE'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.
wait! I LOVE YOU, MEGAN!
OK?
whatever THE TWO OF YOU ARE GOING ON, IT STOPS NOW. - I DIDN'T
I-I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TALK WHILE SHE'S TALKING.
you ARE SCARING THE PATIENTS.
and YOU'RE MAKING THIS HOSPITAL LOOK RIDICULOUS,
and YOU'RE MAKING US LOOK INCOMPETENT.
no, BUT WE HAVE... - NO, IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
just STAY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. SO MUCH AS A TEAR
or A GLANCE IN EACH OTHER'S DIRECTION, AND IT'S OVER.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND-- NO, NO, NO. DON'T TALK WHILE I'M TALKING.
that's WHAT I WAS...
now JUST GET OUT.
go.
not TOGETHER.
Oh, THAT FELT GOOD.
you PAGED ME, DR. BAILEY?
Oh, YES. UM, YOU'RE FINISHED WITH YOUR PART
of THE FACE TRANSPLANT, RIGHT?
Yes, BUT I CLEARED MY SCHEDULE
to WATCH SLOAN AND DR. YANG DO THEIR SURGERIES.
so WHATEVER IT IS YOU NEED,
I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO TIME CONSUMING. - THAT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW FAST YOU CAN DRIVE AND TALK.
uh, I'M SORRY.
I NEED YOU TO DRIVE OUT TO THE WOODS
and TALK DEREK SHEPHERD INTO COMING BACK HERE.
and I BELIEVE YOU ALSO MIGHT RUN INTO CALLIE TORRES,
with A FLAT TIRE OR A BROKEN HEEL
or AN... AX-WIELDING SERIAL KILLER.
you're SERIOUS? - SEE, I SENT TORRES AFTER SHEPHERD,
and SHE'S FALLEN OFF THE GRID.
her PHONE GOES STRAIGHT TO VOICE MAIL.
okay, I--I'M NORMALLY NOT A PANICKY PERSON,
but I'M A FAN OF DAYTIME TELEVISION,
and, YOU KNOW, THE MIND CREATES THESE SCENARIOS
uh, NEVER MIND.
I NEED YOU TO GO GET TORRES AND SHEPHERD
and BRING THEM BACK HERE
before THE CHIEF NOTICES THAT ANY OF YOU ARE GONE. - SHEPHERD'S BEEN GONE ALL WEEK.
I'm SURE THE CHIEF WOULDN'T NOTICE-- HUNT!
you SURVIVED A WAR. - MM-HMM.
you CAN DO THIS.
I KNOW I CAN DO THIS. I'M SAYING I DON'T WANT TO.
people DON'T REALLY SAY NO TO YOU, DO THEY?
not WHEN I SAY PLEASE.
I'm SAYING PLEASE.
O. R.'s SET. TRANSPORT'S ON ITS WAY.
you READY? I'VE BEEN READY FOR 12 YEARS.
y-you SAID YOU HAD SOME FRIENDS
that WERE COMING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU? - YEAH, AFTER MY SURGERY.
they're COMING NOW.
surprise!
Hi, IT'S ME, SHAYNA.
you CAN PROBABLY TELL FROM MY VANDA ROTHSCHILDIANA.
uh, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT MAD THAT WE CAME EARLY.
we THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE HERE THROUGH IT ALL,
make SURE YOU KNEW-- GET OUT.
get THEM OUT. THEY'RE STRANGERS. I DON'T WANT THEM IN HERE.
well, WE'RE HARDLY STRANGERS, DAVE.
we CHAT EVERY NIGHT, ALL NIGHT FOR YEARS.
we--we FLEW IN S-- - GET OUT!
we've NEVER MET. YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
you DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME. GET OUT.
GET--GET THEM OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!
get OUT!
Hey, DID YOU GET MY PAGE?
you GOT THE APPOINTMENT. IT'S IN, LIKE, 15 MINUTES.
God, HOW AMAZING AM I?
it USUALLY TAKES WEEKS TO GET IN THERE.
uh, DID YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE RESEARCH? - SERIOUSLY? CAN I JUST EAT?
no. I'M SORRY. YOU DON'T HAVE TIME.
time FOR WHAT?
to DO, UH, THERE'S, UH, AN ENEMA.
uh, IZZIE'S ENEMA.
Yes, I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET AN ENEMA TODAY,
but I DECIDED IT CAN WAIT.
how ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?
n-no. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.
you've BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT BEING REALLY BACKED UP,
and I GOT YOU AN APPOINTMENT.
dude, IF YOU NEED AN ENEMA THAT BAD,
maybe YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ALL THESE FRIES. - YOU REALLY BOOKED HER AN APPOINTMENT FOR AN ENEMA?
you CAN'T JUST SAY THAT YOU'RE ALL BACKED UP
and JUST SIT THERE, IZZIE. IF YOU MAKE THE DECISION
to GET AN ENEMA, THEN YOU SHOULD GET AN ENEMA. I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE
that's BACKED UP.
solo SURGERY PANIC? TELL YOU WHAT
I'll SCRUB IN WITH YOU. IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT, I'LL TAKE OVER.
I DON'T--I'M--NO. OKAY.
you KNOW, I'M JUST SAYING,
enemas CAN BE A SERIOUS BUSINESS.
okay. IZZIE,"ENEMA" IS CODE FOR WHAT?
my ENEMA, MY BUSINESS.
uh, 15 MINUTES.
this IS A REALLY STRANGE DAY.
I WAS A SECOND-YEAR RESIDENT.
M. V.C. ROLLS IN.
parents WERE IN THE FRONT SEAT, THREE KIDS IN THE BACK.
kids WERE OKAY.
mom AND DAD WERE A LITTLE BANGED UP, BUT NOTHING TERRIBLE.
they WERE TALKING AND LAUGHING IN THE E. R.
turns OUT BOTH PARENTS HAD MASSIVE INTERNAL INJURIES.
I OPERATED ON THEM BOTH THAT NIGHT--HOURS.
lost 'EM BOTH.
you KNOW, IF I HAD MOVED FASTER,
if I HAD RUSHED THEM TO C. T.
if I HAD KNOWN HOW BAD OFF THEY WERE SOONER,
but I DIDN'T.
the OLDEST KID WAS 9.
when I CAME OUT TO TELL 'EM ABOUT THEIR DAD,
he WAS TRYING TO CONSOLE THE 3 YEAR OLD AND THE 5 YEAR OLD
about THEIR MOTHER.
I'll NEVER GET THAT IMAGE OUT OF MY HEAD--THIS
this 9-YEAR-OLD BOY TRYING TO HOLD THESE 2 LITTLE ONES,
and HIS ARMS-- JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY.
I THINK PART OF ME NEVER DID.
I'm SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IRAQ.
I DON'T TALK ABOUT IRAQ.
what I'M-- WHAT MY POINT WAS
I KEPT...
you KNOW, I... I WENT BACK.
I SHOWED UP. I...
I SHOWED UP FOR WORK, YOU KNOW?
or YOU GO DEAD INSIDE.
you GO DEAD INSIDE BECAUSE IF YOU ACTUALLY FELT IT?
if YOU LET YOURSELF FEEL THAT? NO WAY YOU'RE GOING BACK.
no WAY.
you BLEW IT OFF?
Cristina, PLEASE.
I CALLED EVERY FAVOR I HAD IN THIS HOSPITAL
and THEN SOME.
Swender's THE BEST SURGICAL ONCOLOGIST
in THIS STATE.
why DIDN'T YOU GO? WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?
Oh, WHY DON'T YOU? I'M WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS.
so THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS-- THEY WERE CALLING THE GUY BLOWHOLE, CRISTINA.
not JUST THE INTERNS-- ALEX.
what ARE THEY GONNA CALL ME WHEN I'M THE PATIENT,
swiss CHEESE FOR BRAINS?
no. THAT'S AWKWARD AND LONG. BLOWHOLE'S PITHY.
I'm NOT GONNA BE A PIECE OF MEAT IN THIS HOSPITAL
while YOU ALL FIGHT OVER WHO GETS TO SLICE ME UP
and THEN LAUGH WHILE YOU DO IT.
okay, THIS RIGHT HERE
this, UM, IS
a-an EMOTIONAL THING YOU'RE HAVING
which IS WHY YOU SHOULD TELL MEREDITH OR GEORGE OR
I'm NOT TELLING ANYBODY, SO JUST DROP IT.
no. Y-YOU'RE NOT DUMPING THIS ON ME.
you're NOT DYING IN MY ARMS.
so EITHER YOU TELL THEM, OR I WILL.
no, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WANT TREATMENT, CRISTINA.
I KNOW TOO MUCH.
I KNOW HOW VIOLENT SURGERY CAN BE.
they're GONNA CUT INTO MY BRAIN.
they're GONNA SLICE OPEN MY ABDOMEN
and PULL MY ORGANS OUT, AND FOR WHAT?
surgery FAILS ALL THE TIME.
Derek SHEPHERD IS IN THE FREAKIN' WOODS RIGHT NOW
because WE FAIL ALL THE TIME.
and EVEN IF THEY DO EVERYTHING RIGHT,
I HAVE A 5% CHANCE OF SURVIVAL.
why WOULD I PUT MYSELF THROUGH HELL,
run POISON THROUGH MY VEINS, IRRADIATE MY BRAIN,
if IT'S NOT GONNA WORK ANYWAY?
why DID YOU TELL ME, THEN?
if YOU DON'T WANT MY HELP,
and YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT,
why DID YOU TELL ME?
just KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
and FORGET I EVER TOLD YOU ANYTHING. - IZZIE. OH.
you NEED TO CALL 'EM BACK, DAVE.
you're MY SURGEON, RIGHT?
you're NOT MY SHRINK.
so WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO YOUR JOB?
because I CAN'T DO MY JOB ANYMORE.
it TOOK US THREE YEARS TO FIND THE RIGHT CANDIDATE,
and PART OF YOU BEING THE RIGHT CANDIDATE
is HAVING A SUPPORT SYSTEM POST-OP.
you CANNOT DO THIS ALONE.
the ETHICS BOARD WILL NOT ALLOW ME
to LET YOU DO IT ALONE.
you NEED YOUR FRIENDS.
you SEE THAT ORCHID?
it's--it's UGLY.
to ANYONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW ORCHIDS,
it's DARK AND DROOPY AND IT'S UGLY...
unless YOU KNOW IT,
unless YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IT ADAPTED
what IT'S LIVED THROUGH,
and HOW STRONG IT HAD TO BE TO SURVIVE.
a PHOTO OF THAT ORCHID,
that's THE ONLY PICTURE MY FRIENDS HAVE SEEN OF ME.
and THAT'S HOW I WANTED THEM TO PICTURE ME
until I HAD MY NEW FACE.
people LOOK AWAY FROM ME.
kids CRY AND...
adults CRINGE.
they LOOK AWAY.
I DIDN'T WANT MY FRIENDS...
I D--I DIDN'T WANT THEM
to EVER HAVE ANY REASON TO LOOK AWAY.
they DIDN'T LOOK AWAY.
your FRIENDS,
they DIDN'T CRINGE, NOT ONE OF THEM.
they DIDN'T LOOK AWAY. YOU LOOKED AWAY.
you DIDN'T TRUST THEM. YOU LOOKED AWAY FROM THEM.
look, LET US CALL THEM. THEY FLEW ALL THE WAY HERE.
just LET US CALL THEM BACK. IT'S NOT TOO LATE.
if YOU WANT THIS SURGERY, DAVE,
you GOTTA GIVE 'EM A CHANCE.
Oh, UH, CHIEF?
Dr. BAILEY.
Ooh. HOW'S YOUR MOOD?
eager. ANXIOUS.
uh, I'M EXCITED ABOUT SLOAN'S FACE TRANSPLANT.
I'm A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT DEREK SHEPHERD,
but, YOU KNOW, ALL IN ALL - DO I LOOK LIKE A THERAPIST?
you ASKED.
I've LOST HUNT AND TORRES.
see, I-I SENT THEM TO GET SHEPHERD,
and I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.
see, I WAS TRYING TO SOLVE THE SHEPHERD SITUATION
for YOU, SIR,
but IT APPEARS I'VE SOMEHOW MADE IT THREE TIMES WORSE.
so I'M TELLING YOU, AND MY NEXT MOVE, I BELIEVE,
is THAT I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE,
because I'M HALF CONVINCED THEY'RE ALL DEAD...
on A SPIT WITH A ONE-ARMED MAN
turning 'EM INTO SHISH KEBABS.
sir, IT'S MY MIND, IT JUST GOES THERE.
don't BEAT YOURSELF UP. IT'S A HARD DECISION.
Yeah, YOU'VE BEEN WITH PIERCE FOR THE WHOLE YEAR.
just LISTEN TO YOUR HEART. STOP THINKING SO HARD. - EXACTLY. LISTEN TO YOUR HEART.
why ARE THEY STARTING LATE? THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE RECIPIENT.
they've ONLY GOT A FEW HOURS LEFT
for THAT FACE TO STILL BE VIABLE.
Oh, SHOOT. SLOAN MUST BE FREAKING OUT, RIGHT?
home WRECKER. WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?
what? - WHAT DID HE JUST SAY?
guys, GUYS! HEY! YOU TWO, GET OUT. YOU, COME WITH ME.
come ON. HEY, BUDDY.
you NEED TO START TALKING. YOU NEED TO START TALKING NOW.
I REALLY CAN'T. TALK TO STEVE.
RY-GUY, YOU GOTTA START TALKING, DUDE... MNH-MNH.
because ANY SECOND, THEY'RE GONNA START
that FACE TRANSPLANT SURGERY, AND THEN HER GOOD FRIEND... MY BEST FRIEND.
is GONNA HAVE HER VERY FIRST SOLO SURGERY,
and SO...
we HAVE VERY LITTLE PATIENCE RIGHT NOW.
look, IT'S NOT MY PLACE-- - OKAY.
you ARE GONNA TELL ME EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON,
or ELSE EVERY TIME I HAVE A RECTAL EXAM
or AN INFECTED ABSCESS,
it's GONNA HAVE YOUR NAME ON IT. EVERY TIME.
Megan WAS WITH PIERCE,
but THEY BROKE UP FOR A LITTLE BIT.
while THEY WERE BROKEN UP, SHE SLEPT WITH STEVE,
and THEN SHE GOT BACK TOGETHER WITH PIERCE.
but STEVE SENT HER AN E-MAIL ABOUT HOW THEY SLEPT TOGETHER,
and INSTEAD OF JUST E-MAILING HER,
he HIT "REPLY ALL," WENT TO A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE,
one OF 'EM WAS PIERCE.
and NOW STEVE SAYS HE LOVES HER. PIERCE WANTS TO KILL HIM.
MEGAN'S, LIKE, REALLY FREAKING OUT, RIGHT? BECAUSE...
okay, WAIT, SO A WHILE BACK,
someone SENT THIS TEXT MESSAGE, RIGHT?
and, LIKE, I DIDN'T GET IT. I DIDN'T GET TO SEE IT.
it JUST CAME TO CERTAIN PEOPLE'S PHONES, YOU KNOW...
why WOULD THEY COME BACK?
I WAS CRUEL. I WAS HATEFUL.
you WERE SCARED. THEY SURPRISED YOU.
you WERE IN SHOCK, AND IT WASN'T WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTING.
you WERE... YOU WERE JUST-- I WAS AWFUL.
you WERE SCARED.
and YOU WERE TRYING TO PROTECT THEM.
if THEY'RE YOUR FRIENDS, THEY'LL UNDERSTAND.
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE IT.
this--this UGLINESS, IT ISN'T ME.
I-I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE IT.
this RIGHT HERE...
it LOOKS JUST LIKE THE CORYANTHES SPECIOSA.
you GUYS SEE THAT?
she's RIGHT.
the COLORING'S JUST THE SAME.
if THE SURGERY DOESN'T TAKE,
if--if I REJECT THE DONOR FACE, I'LL BE UGLIER.
I'll--I'll BE EVEN UGLIER THAN I AM RIGHT NOW.
please DON'T CALL MY DEAR FRIEND UGLY.
you're A SURVIVOR.
and IT'S WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE.
what THE HELL IS THIS? OH, THIS IS NOT OKAY.
I HAVE A HOSPITAL TO RUN.
and, DEREK, WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH YOU, MAN?
we've ALL BEEN THERE. - WE SAID THAT.
we've ALL HAD TOUGH LOSSES. HE KNOWS THAT.
we SHOW UP THE NEXT DAY, AND WE TRY AND SAVE THE NEXT LIFE.
Yeah, WE COVERED THAT, TOO.
okay, WHAT ABOUT THIS?
nothing WE DO CAN STOP DEATH.
we CAN HOLD IT AT BAY NOW AND THEN,
but EVERYONE DIES.
and THAT'S NOT ON US.
I TOOK A PREGNANT WOMAN IN FOR A SIMPLE SURGERY
and I BOTCHED IT.
that IS ON ME. I SHOULD FEEL BADLY ABOUT THAT.
and YOU?
you SHOULD FEEL BADLY THAT WHILE I WAS OUT HERE,
you SENT MEREDITH OUT HERE EXPECTING A RING.
why WOULD YOU DO THAT?
why IN GOD'S NAME WOULD YOU DO THAT?
I... I WAS TRYING TO HELP.
she DIDN'T WANT TO COME.
I MEAN, SHE WANTED TO LEAVE YOU OUT HERE ALONE.
I... I WAS TRYING TO HELP, DEREK.
you WERE TRYING TO HELP YOURSELF, NOT ME.
yourself.
I HIT THE RING IN THE WOODS.
in THE WOODS.
you DESTROYED ME.
this IS THE FINAL DISSECTION. YOU'LL PLACE THE FACIAL GRAFT.
I'll BE CONNECTING THE VESSELS AND NERVES.
get THE MICROSCOPE READY.
okay, PEOPLE, IT'S TIME.
you EVER PUT A NEW FACE ON SOMEONE?
Really?
I'll TAKE THE RIGHT SIDE, YOU TAKE THE LEFT.
very GENTLY.
that's IT.
take YOUR TIME. HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
okay.
watch THE LEFT CORNER OF HIS MOUTH.
you're OFF CENTER JUST A BIT.
there WE GO.
careful AROUND THE EYES.
good. VERY GOOD, DR. GREY.
get OUT. NO.
get OUT. NO.
Richard! NO!
get OUT! LOOK, I'VE DESTROYED LIVES BEFORE,
several IN FACT, AND YOURS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
I SENT THE WOMAN YOU LOVE OUT HERE TO HELP YOU.
I SENT THE WOMAN WHO LOVES YOU OUT HERE
to BRING YOU BACK TO YOUR LIFE.
if YOU RUINED IT WITH HER, THAT'S ON YOU.
I DON'T ACCEPT IT.
you're SCARED. YOU'RE DRUNK. YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY IS UP.
you THREW A PUNCH AT YOUR BEST FRIEND,
you THREW A RING AT MEREDITH, NOW YOU WANT TO THROW ME OUT.
I'm NOT ACCEPTING IT, BECAUSE I'M OLDER THAN YOU,
and I'VE BEEN WHERE YOU ARE.
you BEEN DRUNK FOR A FEW DAYS. I WAS DRUNK FOR YEARS.
and I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA NEED AT LEAST ONE FRIEND
when YOU DECIDE TO COME OUT OF THAT HOLE YOU'RE DIGGING.
I HOPE YOU COME OUT OF IT SOON.
I'll BE HERE WHEN YOU DO.
I DON'T THINK I CAN GET HER BACK.
did YOU CALL HER?
what AM I GONNA SAY?
I HAD AN AFFAIR FOR YEARS.
and WHEN ADELE FOUND OUT, SOMEHOW SHE...
she TOOK ME BACK.
you CAN MAKE YOUR WAY BACK...
from ANYTHING.
this IS YEAR ONE OF YOUR RESIDENCY.
you TURN ON EACH OTHER NOW,
you're NOT GONNA MAKE IT.
okay, HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
all OF YOU ARE GOING TO GO FIND THE SENSE
that THE GOOD LORD GAVE YOU
and NEVER BEHAVE LIKE THIS WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS
of THIS HOSPITAL EVER AGAIN.
you ARE DOCTORS.
Pierce, GET AN ICE PACK
and PUT IT ON THAT OOZING, DISGUSTING MESS OF AN EYE.
and, STEVE, GO TO THE PIT
and GET THAT UNSANITARY, BLOODY HAND X-RAYED AND STITCHED.
and, MEGAN, YOU SHOULD GO TO O. B.
because, YES, YOU ARE PREGNANT.
that WAS VERY BAILEY.
you READY, DR. YANG?
wait. I'M SORRY.
I NEED ONE THING FROM YOU BEFORE I GO UNDER.
now I HAVEN'T ASKED FOR MUCH.
you HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS,
and I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE BUSY,
but I'M SCARED. I DON'T WANT TO DIE.
I WANT TO GO ON A TOUR OF RUSSIA WITH MY FRIENDS NEXT YEAR.
I MAY JUST BE A BATTY OLD LADY TO YOU,
and THIS MAY BE A SILLY LITTLE PROCEDURE,
but I NEED YOU TO TELL ME THAT IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
you're MY SURGEON, AFTER ALL.
this ISN'T A SILLY PROCEDURE, TO ME, MS. SULLY.
and I WILL GET YOU THROUGH THIS.
okay.
thank YOU.
I'm READY NOW.
Izzie HAS STAGE IV METASTATIC MELANOMA
that HAS SPREAD TO HER BRAIN, LIVER AND SKIN.
she MAY ONLY HAVE MONTHS TO LIVE,
and SHE'S RESISTING TREATMENT.
she NEEDS HELP.
scalpel.
no, NO, DON'T TRY TO TALK, DAVE.
it'll ONLY HURT. YOU DID GREAT.
can HE SEE HIS NEW FACE?
I THINK HE'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE IT. IT'S STILL EARLY.
it's VERY SWOLLEN AND BRUISED.
the TISSUE NEEDS TIME TO SETTLE.
but YEAH. I'LL GIVE YOU A SNEAK PEEK.
sometimes WE FAIL, BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.
I KNOW. - BLOWHOLE HAS A NEW FACE.
you KNOW, AND WHAT PEOPLE CALL HIM
to GET THROUGH THE DAY IS
Cristina, I KNOW.
I TOLD ALEX
and BAILEY.
and THEY'RE TELLING MEREDITH AND GEORGE.
no, I COULDN'T DO MY JOB.
I THINK YOU CAME TO ME FOR HELP,
and THAT'S WHAT I DID.
because SOMETIMES WE WIN, IZZIE.
and I WANT YOU TO FIGHT, OKAY?
you KNOW, FOR WHATEVER THAT'S WORTH,
I WANT YOU TO FIGHT.
thank YOU.
Dr. GREY?
they THINK THAT YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME,
and THEY THINK THAT I'M USING YOU.
but THEY DON'T KNOW US.
they THINK THAT WE'RE UGLY,
but I KNOW THAT WE'RE BEAUTIFUL.
and WE CAN ADAPT TO A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT.
thanks FOR COMING.
thanks FOR CALLING.
I LOVE YOU.
I KNOW.
would YOU STILL LOVE ME IF I WASN'T A SURGEON?
no.
no, BECAUSE IZZIE...
has SKIN CANCER THAT SPREAD TO HER BRAIN.
and YOU'RE ONE OF ABOUT 20 PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO CAN SAVE HER.
and I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD RESPECT SOMEBODY
who COULD WALK AWAY FROM A GIFT LIKE THAT.
so PLEASE DON'T.
here ARE HER SCANS.
it's PRETTY BAD.
practicing MEDICINE
doesn't LEND ITSELF WELL TO MAKING FRIENDS...
maybe BECAUSE LIFE AND MORTALITY...
are IN OUR FACES ALL THE TIME...
maybe BECAUSE IN STARING DOWN DEATH EVERY DAY...
we're FORCED TO KNOW THAT LIFE...
every MINUTE...
is BORROWED TIME...
and EACH PERSON WE LET OURSELVES CARE ABOUT...
is JUST ONE MORE LOSS SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE.
for THIS REASON...
I KNOW SOME DOCTORS WHO JUST DON'T BOTHER MAKING FRIENDS AT ALL.
but THE REST OF US...
we MAKE IT OUR JOB TO MOVE THAT LINE...
to PUSH EACH LOSS...
as FAR AWAY AS WE CAN.
surgeons aren't known for being warm and cuddly. They are arrogant, impatient, mean as often as nugget you can go with straight up chemo and immunol therapy the survival rates are prttey low, but there is a lot of succsefull metastat-sectomies.
we could propbly just, you know, cut this thing out. You think they wouldn't have friends - 'cuz who could stand them. - What are you hiding?
nothing. It's just work stuff.
what is that? A physical surgery? - No. It's nothing.
it's nothing. - Whatever it is , they're gonna pick me. I'm already for the solo. Just for training well.
are you sure you just won't tell him - Yes, I am sure. - Ok. look, I researched a ton of information here you should read all of this before you see this oncologist.
what is that?
I called Dr. Golding and he gave me a direct profile of Dr. Swender.
so I'm gonna try and get you in today. - What are you doing here? - I told you I was fine.
Oh, god. You are so not fine.
I will be fine if I knew Derek is fine. - What? You still haven't heared from him? No word?
Izzie, don't you think you should call in sick today?
what? Why? - Because this is a lot of reading and you are sick. - You guys coming? Big surgery today. - Yeah, Izzie, just... - But surgeons are like a bad cold, nasty but persistent - Chief, I need to ask you about - Sloan, have you heared from Derek? - No.
Oh, I am sorry. You were saying?
Meredith - No, I don't know how he is. I have heared nothing. Nothing today, nothing yesterday, nothing the day before that.
and no. I will not go back out there.
Hey, why move my surgery?
chief, Chief. - Don't. Just don't. He's a wreck. He's disintegrating before our very eyes.
that's why men die earlier than women.
board's a mess. - He can't lose Shepherd. I'll go talk a sense to him, but I just got too much on my plate. - Have you tried calling him?
about a hundred times. - No. Oh. You want me to go to the woods. No .
I don't do woods. The woods are dirty and there are many many bugs. What am I gonna say to the guy? I barely know him.
you don't have to know him. You're both surgeons.
and you've been to the same war. Just remind him we've all been there.
we all came back.
you are kind of a bully, you know that?
wouldn't do it if it didn't work so well.
this is one of the biggest surgeries you may ever get anywhere near. So please pay attention, the patient is 38-year-old man who was hit by a drunk driver 12 years ago.
he suffered severe facial trouble, he's got no nose no lips. That's why we dubed him "blowhole." He's had 9 reconstructive surgeries, none of which brought back full form or function. This surgery have already been done 4 times worldwide and all of the candidates have to undergo extensive psychologicl testing to determine whether or not they can handle the process. Psychological components are assigned, cuz this surgery has a huge chance of rejection or infection. Patient will have to be in a room ...
we will be on right for antirejection drugs which pretty might risk for lung foma, diabetes, hypertension. - I hear they call the dude "blowhole." - What did you just say?
nothing. I just heared the other nickname.
don't talk anymore, ever!
Holly crap!
blowhole is right! - What did I tell you?
surgeons, nasty, aggressive, unstoppable.
just the kind of people you want on your side when you are really screwed. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mr. David Young. Today, he will be receiving a face transplant.
Dr. hunt and his team
will be recovering the donor facial graft.
we're replacing 70% of Mr. Young's face.
see the deficit here. - Or here.
the donor recovery will include his nose,
left eye, lips, left zygoma.
why will allotransplantation
work better than traditional techniques?
better aesthetic outcome,
which allows for reinnervation of the facial nerves,
giving a better functional result.
very good, Dr. Grey.
then we'll position the flap over mr. young's face.
how do we know when we're in the clear?
when the graft turns pink.
excellent.
Dave, any questions for us?
H-has anyone seen the donor?
Yes. he's a match with your age, skin tone and blood type.
what does he look like?
I think you'll be satisfied.
who am I kidding? it's a face, right?
if I end up anything above a point-and-stare freak,
I'm gonna call it a success.
Karev, you're with me on the donor.
usually we take them at the same time,
but the donor's life support is fading fast. We gotta move.
Oh, thank you, sir. - Uh, Stevens, Grey.
Yes!
no, the other Grey.
Really? Uh, great. - great.
you did an awesome job in there.
why don't you call me after the pre-op labs come in?
Dr. Sloan, only one resident?
wait for Bailey. There's already going to be enough of a crowd.
what the hell?
uh, izzie,
I don't think you have time to scrub in with Sloan.
don't worry about it. I can handle it. - "Awesome job."
she probably quizzed him in bed last night.
she gets to work on "blowhole" because she gave Sloan a
shut your mouths!
finish the chart. I'll be back.
uh, O'Malley, Grey,
I need you on pre-ops and post-ops.
but there's the biggest surgery in the world happening here today.
Yes, and half our attendings are involved, which is why we need strong residents on pre-ops and post-ops.
yang, you're with me today.
you're moving to the Big Leagues. - What?
she gets a solo? - Today?
a nice old lady with a hernia. You're gonna fix it.
Congratulations.
I know I should seem more enthusiastic,
but I'm not that big a person.
don't worry about it.
is it wrong to have hatred in your heart?
good morning, Mrs. Sully. I'm Dr. Cristina Yang.
I'll be performing your hernia repair today.
lovely to meet you.
do you have any questions before we get started?
Oh, yes. Can you hand me my purse, please?
my friends gave me a bunch of questions,
and, well, I can't remember any of them, of course.
they're such worrywarts.
they're all off on an European tour without me.
they threatened not to go when this hernia started becoming a problem,
but I told them no, no.
we have been saving up for this for two years.
it helped that I was able to get my deposit back
with a doctor's note. - Mm-hmm.
Cristina Yang.
Yes.
no, no, it has to be today.
it's stage IV.
no, she has to see Dr. Swender,
not--not a partner.
uh... um, I'm sorry, Ma'am.
um, I will get to your questions when I come back to examine you, okay?
referral was Golding. Golding.
it's a little early in the day for that,
don't you think?
you sound like my mother.
uh, I met your mother. I liked her.
who sent you--richard?
uh, Bailey.
of course.
look, I'm sorry about your patient.
I know how hard it could be.
I-I had a patient a couple of years ago
uh, young guy, 50 maybe.
simple knee replacement.
he was post-op, he was fine.
I even told his wife she could go and get him lunch.
I mean, it was a simple knee replacement. it was nothing.
but, uh, he'd been getting short of breath,
so I put him on blood thinners for a post-surgical p. e.
and, uh, it wasn't until he was vomiting up dark red blood,
looking me in the eye telling me that he was dying,
that I figured it out-- that I was wrong,
that it wasn't a p. e., he was bleeding internally.
and it wouldn't have been fatal, but the blood thinners...
God, I will never forget the look on his wife's face...
when she came back with that sandwich in her hand,
asking me why her husband wasn't in his room anymore.
how do you live with it?
killing him...
taking him from his wife.
how do you live with it?
we call it malpractice. We call it a mistake.
Yeah, I know what we call it.
I'm asking you, when you get up in the morning,
how do you look at yourself in the mirror?
I'm not--i'm--i'm...
I'm asking.
can I get one of those?
it's the not knowing that does it.
not knowing if he's okay, not knowing if he's coming back.
maybe I've just been dumped.
I mean, it's not knowing if I'm single
that makes me want to throw up all day long.
you are not listening to me, are you? - Uh, sorry.
no, no, that's okay. I get it.
you've got the solo surgery and G.I.Joe.
it's a charmed life, you don't have time for me.
I have not had G.I.Joe, we've kissed a couple times.
it's like friends with benefits,
without the benefits.
still no sex?
Mnh-mnh. Not a charmed life.
lab results on the splenectomy.
do we ask?
no... 'cause he might tell us.
can you imagine?
this guy's got a family, right?
a wife, kids?
one day they're gonna be walking down the street
and see his face on somebody else's body.
it's kinda creepy, right?
Mr. Young won't look exactly like the donor.
the underlying facial structure of any two people can be very different.
Plus, a person's identity is more than just skin and bone.
his expressions, his style, his eyes.
the donor's family wouldn't recognize this face on anyone else.
transplant surgeons are getting antsy.
transplant surgeons are always antsy.
they can't relax until they've got live tissues in their coolers.
all right, I am making the final dissection.
Karev, take a hold right at the temple.
and gently...lift.
don't tear the flesh.
awesome.
tenderness around the incision is normal.
no signs of infection. Would you redress that wound?
uh, Megan, will you please go to 20...
go to room 22-14 and...
Thanks.
just take out the drain... When you're ready?
uh, I know it seems personal,
and we wouldn't ask if we didn't need to know,
but have you passed gas yet?
sorry.
we can't release you until that happens
the gas. - I'm sorry. I'm trying to listen.
but are they supposed to look like that?
like what?
the bleeding and the shiner,
and that one looks like she's suicidal.
they're supposed to be doctors?
we're gonna reserve judgment on that for right now.
freak show.
what the heck do we do with them?
can we shove them in a locker?
I guess we should just talk to them.
no. We're professionals, and that's clearly personal.
besides, we'll just waste time.
we'll never get to see the solo surgery or the face transplant.
Oh, that's a-- yeah, that's a good point.
I guess, well, we should-- we should just ignore it then.
Yeah, we should just ignore it.
it's the professional thing to do.
Yeah, professionally ignore them.
it's important that you take all the medications,
uh, because there's a risk of
risk of rejection and infection. I know.
I know. You drilled it into my head a thousand times.
and is your family here yet? I'm--i just ask because
someone's gonna need to take care of you afterwards.
I don't have family,
but my friends are coming after the surgery.
I'm excited to meet them and show them my new face.
we met in an online chat room for orchid lovers.
and, well, um, we've never actually "met" met, so...
Dave, um, after the surgery,
this device is gonna help prevent lung problems
by exercising the muscles you use to breathe.
I'd like you to practice on it now, okay? - Sit up straight.
take three easy breaths and then blow... into that...
hole.
that's it.
both of you in the hall, now.
you really think that was okay?!
you think that was doctorly?!
you two find something else to do.
what the hell is going on with you?
they were making completely inappropriate jokes
at the expense of the patient right in front of him.
I have been trying to teach them,
and they were cruel and inappropriate.
okay, they were inappropriate.
you know what else is inappropriate? This. You.
this case is my baby.
I've spent three years planning for it,
and you and your emotional life
are not about to piss all over it.
you're off the case. - No.
he needs me in there with him.
you can't leave him alone with those interns.
okay, fine. You want to be there for his feelings?
you can be there before and after the surgery.
but you're not coming in my o. r.
and whatever's going on with you, Stevens,
you better get it under control.
I found them.
what? Oh, um, the, uh, questions about the surgery?
one of my friends who went on the trip--Bill Ferguson.
he's a retired surgeon, and he told me to ask you these.
but I can't seem to find my glasses.
my friends should be here.
I'm always putting my glasses down somewhere, and they always find them for me. Okay, "Will you finally be able to pick up your grandkids?"
is--is this a question from a doctor?
no. no, my other friends helped me with some questions,
plus I added a few on my own, like will it hurt?
will it... hurt?
you'll be anesthetized.
Oh, yes, I know that.
I mean, after, will it hurt?
uh, you should expect normal, post-operative pain.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, no. That is fantastic.
no, I'll--I'll take it. I'll take it.
thank you so much. Thank you.
no, I'll get in touch with her right away.
um, 2: 30? Anytime is fine.
so I've covered 22-13, 19 and 33.
Yeah, okay, and I've got 20-11 and 20-07.
Mer, there is something wrong with Izzie.
uh, what do you mean?
I don't know.
all I know is that there is something wrong.
well, you know, George,
we're already drowning in the intern drama.
we don't need a resident drama, too.
if it's a problem, she'll tell us.
until then, just ignore it.
I repeat, ignore it.
what in god's name is going on?
it's a personal issue,
and we are just trying to give them their privacy.
Oh, do you think for a second
I wanted to get involved with your little intern dramas?
we were not this bad. - Oh, uh, getting married in Vegas,
shaking up with attendings, cutting LVAD wires?
look, you don't have to like it, but you have to manage it.
Oh, we've got it under control.
wait! I love you, Megan!
sir. Are you ok?
I'm so sorry.
whatever the two of you are going on, it stops now.
I didn't - I-I don't think you should talk while she's talking.
you are scaring the patients.
and you're making this hospital look ridiculous.
and you're making us look incompetent.
no, but we have - No, it's not a good idea.
just stay away from each other. So much as a tear
or a glance in each other's direction, and it's over.
I don't understand-- - no, no, no. don't talk while I'm talking.
that's what I was...
now just get out.
go.
not together.
Oh, that felt good.
you paged me, Dr. Bailey?
Oh, yes.
you're finished with your part of the face transplant, right?
Yes, but I cleared my schedule
to watch Sloan and Dr. Yang do their surgeries.
so whatever it is you need,
I hope it's not too time consuming.
that all depends on how fast you can drive and talk.
uh, I'm sorry.
I need you to drive out to the woods,
and talk Derek Shepherd into coming back here.
and I believe you also might run into Callie Torres,
with a flat tire or a broken heel,
or an... ax-wielding serial killer.
you're serious? - See, I sent Torres after Shepherd,
and she's fallen off the grid.
her phone goes straight to voice mail.
okay, I--I'm normally not a panicky person,
but I'm a fan of daytime television,
and, you know, the mind creates these scenarios.
uh, never mind.
I need you to go get Torres and Shepherd
and bring them back here
before the chief notices that any of you are gone.
shepherd's been gone all week.
I'm sure the chief wouldn't notice-- - Hunt!
you survived a war. - Mm-hmm.
you can do this.
I know I can do this. I'm saying I don't want to.
people don't really say no to you, do they?
not when I say please.
I'm saying please.
O. r.'s set. Transport's on its way.
you ready? - I've been ready for 12 years.
y-you said you had some friends that were coming to take care of you? - Yeah, after my surgery.
they're coming now.
surprise!
Hi, it's me, Shayna.
you can probably tell from my vanda rothschildiana.
uh, I hope you're not mad that we came early.
we thought we should be here through it all - Make sure you knew - Get out.
get them out, they're strangers.
I don't want them in here.
well, we're hardly strangers, Dave.
we chat every night, all night for years.
we--we flew in s-- -Get out!
we've never met, you don't know me.
you don't know anything about me, get out.
Get--get them out! get out! get out!
get out!
Hey, did you get my page?
you got the appointment. It's in, like, 15 minutes.
God, how amazing am I?
it usually takes weeks to get in there.
uh, did you take a look at the research?
Seriously? Can I just eat?
no. I'm sorry. You don't have time.
time for what?
to do, uh, there's, uh, an enema.
uh, Izzie's enema.
Yes, I was supposed to get an enema today,
but I decided it can wait.
how about we talk about something else?
n-no. we need to talk about it.
you've been complaining about being really backed up,
and I got you an appointment.
dude, if you need an enema that bad, maybe you shouldn't have all these fries.
you really booked her an appointment for an enema?
you can't just say that you're all backed up and just sit there, izzie.
if you make the decision to get an enema, then you should get an enema.
I think maybe you're the one that's backed up.
solo surgery panic?
tell you what--I'll scrub in with you.
if you can't handle it, I'll take over.
I don't--I'm--no. Okay.
you know, I'm just saying,
enemas can be a serious business.
okay. Izzie, "enema" is code for what?
my enema, my business.
uh, 15 minutes.
this is a really strange day.
I was a second-year resident.
mvc rolled in.
parents were in the front seat, three kids in the back.
kids were okay.
mom and dad were a little banged up, but nothing terrible.
they were talking and laughing in the E. R.
turns out both parents had massive internal injuries.
I operated on them both that night--hours.
lost 'em both.
you know, if I had moved faster, if I had rushed them to CT, if I had known how bad off they were sooner,
but I didn't.
the oldest kid was 9.
when I came out to tell 'em about their dad, he was trying to console the 3 year old and the 5 year old about their mother.
I'll never get that image out of my head--this
this 9-year-old boy trying to hold these 2 little ones,
and his arms-- just not big enough.
I don't know how I came back the next day.
I think part of me never did.
I'm surprised you didn't talk about Iraq.
I don't talk about Iraq.
and I'm-- what my point was
I kept...
you know, I... I went back.
I showed up. I...
I showed up for work, you know?
or you go dead inside.
you go dead inside because if you actually felt it.
if you let yourself feel that? No way you're going back.
no way.
you blew it off?
Cristina, please.
I called every favor I had in this hospital
and then some.
Swender's the best surgical oncologist in this state.
why didn't you go? - Why do you care so much?
Oh, why don't you? I'm working really hard on this.
so the least you can do is - They were calling the guy blowhole, Cristina.
not just the interns-- Alex.
what are they gonna call me when I'm the patient,
swiss cheese for brains?
no. That's awkward and long.
BLOWHOLE'S pithy.
I'm not gonna be a piece of meat in this hospital
while you all fight over who gets to slice me up and then laugh while you do it.
okay, this right here
this, um, is
a-an emotional thing you're having
which is why you should tell Meredith or George or
I'm not telling anybody, so just drop it.
no. y-you're not dumping this on me.
you're not dying in my arms.
so either you tell them, or I will.
no, I don't even know if I want treatment, Cristina.
I know too much.
I know how violent surgery can be.
they're gonna cut into my brain.
they're gonna slice open my abdomen
and pull my organs out, and for what?
surgery fails all the time.
Derek Shepherd is in the freakin' woods right now
because we fail all the time.
and even if they do everything right,
I have a 5% chance of survival, 5%.
why would I put myself through hell,
run poison through my veins, irradiate my brain,
if it's not gonna work anyway?
why did you tell me, then?
if you don't want my help,
and you're not gonna do anything about it,
why did you tell me?
just keep your mouth shut
and forget I ever told you anything.
Izzie. Oh.
you need to call 'em back, Dave.
you're my surgeon, right?
you're not my shrink.
so why don't you just do your job?
because I can't do my job anymore.
it took us three years to find the right candidate,
and part of you being the right candidate
is having a support system post-op.
you cannot do this alone.
the ethics board will not allow me
to let you do it alone.
you need your friends.
you see that orchid?
it's--it's ugly.
to anyone who doesn't know orchids,
it's dark and droopy and it's ugly...
unless you know it,
unless you understand how it adapted
what it's lived through,
and how strong it had to be to survive.
a photo of that orchid,
that's the only picture my friends have seen of me.
and that's how I wanted them to picture me
until I had my new face.
people look away from me.
kids cry and...
adults cringe.
they look away.
I didn't want my friends...
I d--I didn't want them
to ever have any reason to look away.
they didn't look away.
your friends,
they didn't cringe, not one of them.
they didn't look away. You looked away.
you didn't trust them. You looked away from them.
look, let us call them. They flew all the way here.
just let us call them back. It's not too late.
if you want this surgery, dave,
you gotta give 'em a chance.
Oh, uh, chief?
Dr. Bailey.
Ooh. How's your mood?
eager. Anxious.
uh, I'm excited about Sloan's face transplant.
I'm a little concerned about Derek shepherd, - But, you know, all in all - Do I look like a therapist?
you asked.
I've lost Hunt and Torres.
see, I-I sent them to get Shepherd,
and I never heard from them again.
see, I was trying to solve the Shepherd situation
for you, sir.
but it appears I've somehow made it three times worse.
so I'm telling you, and my next move, I believe,
is that I'm gonna call the police.
because I'm half convinced they're all dead...
on a spit with a one-armed man
turning 'em into shish kebabs.
sir, it's my mind, it just goes there.
don't beat yourself up. It's a hard decision.
Yeah, you've been with Pierce for the whole year.
just listen to your heart.
stop thinking so hard. - Exactly.
listen to your heart.
why are they starting late?
there was a problem with the recipient.
they've only got a few hours left
for that face to still be viable.
Oh, shoot. Sloan must be freaking out, right?
home wrecker. - What did you just say?
what? What did he just say?
guys, guys! - Hey! You two, get out. You, come with me.
come on. hey, buddy.
you need to start talking. You need to start talking now.
I really can't. Talk to Steve.
guy, you gotta start talking, dude... - Mnh-mnh.
because any second, they're gonna start
that face transplant surgery, and then her good friend ... - My best friend.
is gonna have her very first solo surgery,
and so...
we have very little patience right now.
look, it's not my place. - Okay.
you are gonna tell me everything that's going on,
oor else every time I have a rectal exam or an infected abscess,
it's gonna have your name on it. Every time.
Megan was with Pierce,
but they broke up for a little bit.
while they were broken up, she slept with Steve,
and then she got back together with Pierce.
but Steve sent her an e-mail about how they slept together,
and instead of just e-mailing her,
he hit "reply all," went to a whole bunch of people,
one of 'em was Pierce.
and now Steve says he loves her. Pierce wants to kill him.
Megan's, like, really freaking out, right? Because...
okay, wait, so a while back, someone sent this text message, right?
and, like, I didn't get it. I didn't get to see it.
it just came to certain people's phones, you know...
why would they come back?
I was cruel. I was hateful.
you were scared, they surprised you.
you were in shock, and it wasn't what you were expecting.
you were... you were just-- I was awful.
you were scared.
and you were trying to protect them.
if they're your friends, they'll understand.
I didn't want you to see it.
this--this ugliness, it isn't me.
I-I didn't want you to see it.
this right here...
it looks just like the coryanthes speciosa.
you guys see that?
she's right.
the coloring's just the same.
if the surgery doesn't take,
if--if I reject the donor face, I'll be uglier.
I'll--I'll be even uglier than I am right now.
please don't call my dear friend ugly.
you're a survivor.
and it's written all over your face.
what the hell is this? oh, this is not okay.
I have a hospital to run.
and, derek, what the hell's the matter with you, man?
we've all been there. - We said that.
we've all had tough losses. - He knows that.
we show up the next day, and we try and save
the next life. - Yeah, we covered that, too.
okay, what about this?
nothing we do can stop death.
we can hold it at bay now and then,
but everyone dies.
and that's not on us.
I took a pregnant woman in for a simple surgery.
and I botched it.
that is on me. I should feel badly about that.
and you?
you should feel badly that while I was out here,
you sent Meredith out here expecting a ring.
why would you do that?
why in god's name would you do that?
I... I was trying to help.
she didn't want to come.
I mean, she wanted to leave you out here alone.
I... I was trying to help, derek.
you were trying to help yourself, not me.
yourself.
I hit the ring in the woods.
in the woods.
you destroyed me.
you'll place the facial graft.
I'll be connecting the vessels and nerves.
get the microscope ready.
okay, people, it's time.
you ever put a new face on someone?
Really?
I'll take the right side, you take the left.
very gently.
that's it.
take your time, he's not going anywhere.
okay.
watch the left corner of his mouth.
you're off center just a bit.
there we go.
careful around the eyes.
good. Very good, Dr. Grey.
get out.- no.
get out.- no.
Richard!- no!
get out!- look, I've destroyed lives before,
several in fact, and yours is not one of them.
I sent the woman you love out here to help you.
I sent the woman who loves you out here
to bring you back to your life.
if you ruined it with her, that's on you.
I don't accept it.
you're scared, you're drunk, you don't know which way is up.
you threw a punch at your best friend,
you threw a ring at Meredith, now you want to throw me out.
I'm not accepting it, because I'm older than you,
and I've been where you are.
you been drunk for a few days. I was drunk for years.
and I know you're gonna need at least one friend
when you decide to come out of that hole you're digging.
I hope you come out of it soon.
I'll be here when you do.
I don't think I can get her back.
did you call her?
what am I gonna say?
I had an affair for years.
and when Adele found out, somehow she...
she took me back.
you can make your way back...
from anything.
this is year one of your residency.
you turn on each other now,
you're not gonna make it.
okay, here's what's gonna happen
all of you are going to go find the sense
that the good lord gave you
and never behave like this within the four walls
of this hospital ever again.
you are doctors.
Pierce, get an ice pack
and put it on that oozing, disgusting mess of an eye.
and, Steve, go to the pit
and get that unsanitary
bloody hand x-rayed and stitched.
and, Megan, you should go to o. b.
because, yes, you are pregnant.
that was very Bailey.
you ready, Dr. Yang?
wait. I'm sorry.
I need one thing from you before I go under.
now I haven't asked for much.
you haven't answered my questions,
and I understand that you're busy,
but I'm scared. I don't want to die.
I want to go on a tour of Russia with my friends next year.
I may just be a batty old lady to you,
and this may be a silly little procedure,
but I need you to tell me that it's gonna be okay.
you're my surgeon, after all.
this isn't a silly procedure, to me, Mrs. Sully.
and I will get you through this.
thank you.
I'm ready now.
Izzie has stage IV metastatic melanoma
that has spread to her brain, liver and skin.
she may only have months to live,
and she's resisting treatment.
she needs help.
scalpel.
no, no, don't try to talk, Dave.
it'll only hurt, you did great.
can he see his new face?
I think he'd really like to see it. - It's still early.
it's very swollen and bruised.
the tissue needs time to settle.
but yeah. I'll give you a sneak peek.
sometimes we fail, but that's not always the case.
I know. "Blowhole" has a new face.
you know, and what people call him
to get through the day is
Cristina, I know.
I told Alex.
and Bailey.
and they're telling Meredith and George.
Cristina
no, I couldn't do my job.
I think you came to me for help,
and that's what I did.
because sometimes we win, Izzie.
and I want you to fight, okay?
you know, for whatever that's worth,
I want you to fight.
thank you.
Dr. Grey?
they think that you're taking advantage of me,
and they think that I'm using you.
but they don't know us.
they think that we're ugly,
but I know that we're beautiful.
and we can adapt to a hostile environment.
thanks for coming.
thanks for calling.
I love you.
I know.
would you still love me if I wasn't a surgeon?
no.
no, because Izzie...
has skin cancer that spread to her brain.
and you're one of about 20 people in the world
who can save her.
and I don't know if I could respect somebody
who could walk away from a gift like that.
so please don't.
here are her scans.
it's pretty bad.
practicing medicine
doesn't lend itself well to making friends...
maybe because life and mortality...
are in our faces all the time...
maybe because in staring down death every day...
we're forced to know that life...
every minute...
is borrowed time...
and each person we let ourselves care about...
is just one more loss somewhere down the line.
for this reason...
I know some doctors who just don't bother
making friends at all.
but the rest of us...
we make it our job to move that line...
to push each loss...
as far away as we can.
they say lightning never strikes twice, but that's a myth.
and it was so scary, seeing Derek lying on the floor bleeding like that.
so scary.
it feels good just to, you know, get that out, you know?
thank you.
thank you.
I feel like I'm... ready to go back to work.
it doesn't happen often.
lightning usually gets it right the first time.
okay, let's, uh... Talk more about that tomorrow.
come on.
do you need a-a tissue or... A hug or something?
go hug yourself.
when you're hit with 30, 000 amps of electricity, you feel it.
morning.
morning.
it can make you forget who you are.
just... Just... Stay calm.
breathe. Take some deep breaths.
we're-- we're just married.
and we're just gonna get up and go to work like always.
I've got this under control.
now-- now you need to eat this, a little multigrain, and then we're just gonna go to work.
work is what you need right now, okay?
that'll feel good. Okay?
let's just get up, get naked, get in the shower, have a little morning soapy sex, then I'm gonna wash your hair.
I've always wanted to wash your hair.
it can burn you, blind you, stop your heart...
sounds big. I'm betting m. v. c.
multiple m. v.c. or an apartment fire.
when is the staring gonna stop?
as soon as the novelty wears off. Just ignore them.
Owen washed my hair.
and he told me to eat this grainy nut bar.
and he booked me into surgery this morning.
he is in charge of me.
I'm a bride, and I'm going with it.
but trauma guy didn't clear you. - Yeah, but he said he'll figure that out.
Yes.
okay, I am the crazy one.
I am the one who freaks out and screams at people... Like that.
go gawk at each other for a while.
are you okay?
would everybody please just stop asking if I am okay?
okay?
and cause massive internal injurie he clear you yet?
no? Still?
I resorted to tears.
I wore bad mascara so he wouldn't miss them.
what-- what did Derek say?
Oh, I will be avoiding him today.
so you don't have to talk to him about the baby thing?
no.
because you left him in the pokey.
Yeah.
but for something that happens in only a millisecond...
do you feel different?
you know, after you scribbled on the post-it?
I mean, you're supposed to feel different, right?
Oh, well, it takes take. Give it some time.
I mean, your marriage is filled with secrets and felons.
I mean, why am I asking your advice?
it can change your life forever.
Dr. Shepherd, the chief is looking for you. - I know.
you missed the wedding last night. - I know.
you smell lie. - I know.
how was the wedding? - It was fine. I'm sorry you missed it.
Yeah, well, I was busy getting an incarceration record.
do you know what that means?
it means you drive too fast.
Oh, god.
Derek, you smell like... - yeah, I know what I smell like.
I have go to the pit.
they cleared you for surgery?
no, but I can still do consults. So sorry. Bye.
we're not done talking about this.
Oh, god. All right. Did a bus crash?
okay, I'm not saying rip out walls.
I'm saying throw some paint up on 'em. You know, soften it up.
yang decorated the place for her, and it's just a little harsh and frowny.
Oh, okay. I'm gonna stop you right there,'cause Yang doesn't decorate.
I decorated that place. It's my frowny place.
I meant modern and edgy.
if it's gonna be our place, I just need it to be a little more smiley.
my god.
I... Frowny?
edgy.
Wh...watch it! - Sorry.
Dr. Bailey?
you still have that bullet in your chest?
uh, oh, yeah.
it worked its way to the surface.
it's fine. We leave bullets in people all the time.
it must hurt. Does it hurt?
uh, nope.
does it hurt when I do this?
Damn! - It is not fine.
it is foreign, and it has no business being in your body.
get it out, Karev, or I'll see to it that you won't operate until you're operated on.
andrew Perkins hasn't signed off on her.
you disagree with him?
no. Keeping residents out of the o. r.
until they're ready is the right approach for most of them, but not for Cristina.
she won't feel like herself until she's back in surgery again.
you know Yang. - I do.
and you want to start her on an ex vivo heart reconstruction?
this is a once-in-a-life time
it is a hell of a lot of pressure is what it is.
well, she operated on-- I mean, she saved Derek Shepherd with a gun to her head.
I don't think that pressure is the issue for her.
we owe her this, Richard, and she needs it.
put her back in the game.
Linda Cotler, age 51, has been here three times in the last eight years for removal of malignant myxomas from her heart.
but we won't be doing that again.
no, by removing both atria, and hopefully all the cancerous cells, you won't have to keep coming back here.
Hello, Dr. Yang.
nice to see a familiar face.
finally, someone we know.
Mrs. Cotler was a patient of Dr. Burke's.
you assisted on her last myxoma removal
of course. of course. hi.
you were getting married, weren't you?
sorry?
well, got married.
I mean, last night, actually.
you and Dr. Burke?
sorry?
last time we were here, he said you two were getting married.
Oh, yes.
no. That-- that didn't happen.
what a shame.
he went on and on about you.
but you did get married?
we did, last night.
Yes, we did.
well, nice to see you again.
well, uh, sit tight, and we'll be back in with some forms for you to sign, and then we'll take you up.
Thanks, Dr. Altman, and congratulations to you two.
thank you.
okay, multiple burn victims.
two with paralysis, three with vision loss, one, uh, blown eardrums, and one dislocated hip.
house fire? Explosion? - Car wreck?
uh, act of god. - Act of god?
Yeah, lightning strike.
all that from one lightning strike?
one lightning strike, eight victims.
took out a whole flag football team.
God was in a mood today.
how did it strike all of 'em?
well, they're mostly flash burns, so it probably hit one of them then conducted off onto the rest.
T. M.Rupture, trauma one.
I'll see you in there.
tell me something.
when a person gets out of the nut house...
what's the appropriatemount of time to wait before you propose?
what?
long.
longer long-- a long time.
not now.
specifically, how long?
have you seen my friend Kerry?
she's-- she's a girl. Sh-she's the only girl.
you've just got some ferning here.
it's superficial. It's where the electrons entered the skin.
well, what about my arm? I still can't feel my arm.
sit forward.
you changed. - Yeah, and showered, twice, thanks to you.
this is Russ. He was struck by lightning while playing flag football, and he's complaining of paralysis in his left arm.
can you move your fingers for me?
Yeah, see, I couldn't do that when I first got here.
it's probably just transitory paralysis, which is common with lightning strikes.
can you feel that? - Little bit, yeah.
we're gonna keep watching you, but your arm should come back to normal in a couple of hours.
you know they almost revoked my driver's license?
can somebody please check on Kerry for me?
happy to. Right away.
Hey, we're still not done talking about this.
okay, wiggle your toes for me.
I still can't.
am I gonna be in a wheelchair?
we're gonna take you in for a c. t. but hopefully, it is just temporary, from the lightning.
couple of your friends have it, too.
they're already starting to get some feeling back. Try not to worry.
Hey, Kerry. A friend of yours, Russ Gammie, is asking about you.
how's Warren Griffith?
is he okay? Did he ask about me?
which one is Warren? - Excuse me. Excuse me.
I-- Who's this, Russ or Warren?
Mitch? - Mitch now?
Hey, have you seen Warren? Is he okay?
kerry, I gotta say this.
we both could've died out there.
that lightning bolt was like a one-in-a-million shot, so I gotta take one, too.
I love you, Kerry, and if we get through this,
I want you to know, I will love you forever.
sir, I'm sorry. If you're not being treated, then you're gonna have to go to the waiting room.
we'll-- we'll keep you posted.
kerry, can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you fine.
I just didn't want him to know that I heard that.
you're a popular girl.
no. I'm sure he's just overexcited.
it is like a one-in-a-million thing.
actually, it's more like a 1-in-6, 250 kind of thing.
lightning kills between 150 to 300 people every year in the u. s.Alone.
well, no, I mean, it's-- It's still rare.
I mean, it's not, like, say, handgun death.
I mean, that's-- That's 1 in 325.
you okay?
Yeah. No, I'm saying-- I'm saying she's lucky.
that's... You know, hey, yay, you.
can someone just please check on Warren for me?
I need to know if he's okay.
is Warren your boyfriend?
no. He's... no.
okay.
well, you've got two burdrums, but they will heal themselves, too.
great. Thank you.
does that mean there's no surgery?
can I go? Cause Dr. Shepherd's here, so he might have something.
maybe you should stick with me.
kerry will need a workup.
I'm sorry. Why is this better than what Dr. Burke did?
Dr. Burke's approach s conservativend correct for the first few surgeries.
this is radical and risky, but
well, it sounds like it's gonna kill her.
Linda's heart wall has grown weaker with every surgery, so there are greater odds of cardiac rupture.
this may be her last chance.
Paul... Honey, every two years, we come here, they cut me open, and I watch it take ten years off of your life.
I can't do it anymore.
and neither can you.
what about you?
do you think this is the best idea?
Oh, I'm not, um
because what you and Dr. Burke did, it's kept he with me so far.
if this was your husband, would you let Dr. Altman tear apart his heart?
Yes.
an aggressive approach is your only option.
this is what you want.
okay.
all right.
okay.
we'll see you in there.
what are these?
choices.
they're all beige.
no, they're all subtle.
look, pastels and earth tones.
if you look closely, that's blue, that's green, that's yellow
to take the edge off all the chrome and concrete.
what do you think?
I know. You really want to live in the batcave.
but meet me halfway.
uh, yes.
Yes, thank you.
okay, uh, my patient's scans are up.
and, uh, seriously... They're all beige to me.
W - well, then it shouldn't be hard to pick one.
I'm looking for Warren Griffith.
that's me.
I feel kind of queasy.
you've got a little fever. That may be why.
you got hit the hardest.
looks like it went into your neck and came out your foot.
and you're saying it bounced off me and hit everyone else?
I took out the whole team?
it's not like it's your fault.
it kinda feels that way.
I don't remember any of it.
how about my friend Kerry? Is she okay?
she's wondering the same thing about you.
she what? She asked about me?
specifically?
well, what did she say?
are you people in junior high?
I almost told her.
I tried to.
I... I'm gonna tell her.
what are you talking about?
Kerry. I tried to tell her I - I love her, but her-- Her ears are all messed up and
you gotta sit down. - Where are you going?
I gotta tell her. I get to tell her.
G - guys, look, leave her alone. All right?
she coulda died out there.
and besides, she's, like, mine.

she's mine, and I love her.
you need to come back here and sit down!
popular girl.
Oh, my god. Thank you.
Yep, c.t. Looks clear.

which means I can go?
it means you should observe her.

everybody, shut up.
shut up.
okay, warren. You talk.
kerry, I...
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

Hey, don't you worry.
no, she's just the sweetest, funniest-- she's just
just please make sure she's okay.
okay. We will. We're gonna take care of you now.
all right, who do I have? Who's free?
I'm free. I'm good. I'll go.
he's my patient. I'll take him.
book anO. R. You can observe.
I'm fine, and I'm free.
what are you doing?
nothing.
other Grey, Are you free to scrub in?
Absolutely.
I-- I'm available,'cause you haven't been cleared for surgery, right?
april, if we're gonna be friends... You have to stop doing that.
sorry. Habit.
I'm standing right here.
Kepner, go prep him.
okay. - I'll see you up there.
I'm fine.
well, great. Then you can keep an eye on Kerry.
I'll resect both atria... And build new ones out of bovine pericardium.
and during reconstruction, Dr. Hunt will stay with Linda, using a human donor aorta to prepare the vessels for reimplantation.
and all of this in just four hours?
we have to be fast.
we all set?
let's go.
all right. Prep her and page me when she's ready.
sure.
are you excited?
Yes, absolutely.
good.
the fear of going back in is worse than actually doing it.
it's just getting back on the horse is all it is.
this is one hell of a honeymoon, right?
incision looks great.
Hey, I hear you and Torres are shacking up.
uh, uh, yeah.
do I sound more excited than you?
no, no. I am. I am.
how's it going with the hot, trauma counselor?
I have to say... It's great.
the conversation never stops, and I feel, um... I don't know.
I feel good whenever I see him.
no heart murmur. Good girl.
what do you talk about?
what's he like? - He's, um...
well, he likes to, uh...
I guess I-I mostly talk, and he mostly listens.
he's-- he's an amazingly good lister.
well, he should be.
it's what he gets paid for.
Yeah.
you love Warren?
Warren's bald, Kerry.
I know that, Mitch.
you guys don't love me.
I'm a girl who's down with flag football, so you think you love me.
Plus, we got struck by lightning, so that's...
nice.
you made her cry.
Oh, crap. You know, sorry.
you know, Warren's a good guy.
he could probably get a hairpiece or something and
she's crying because everything's changed. Okay?
lightning struck, and everything changed.
you were her team.
she was one of you, and-- and now you're just
you're looking at her differently.
um, n-no.
I'm crying because i'm worried about Warren.
could you please find out if he's okay?
Really?
this is what I'm cleared to do.
I'm cleared to solve this puzzle.
don't buy a vowel, you idiot.
scarlet pimpernel.
how did you-- There was one "c" and an "m.
have you talked to Derek yet about the... - Today's not the day.
right.
he just got out of the jail.
let him ease back into society.
you ready?
you up for this?
up for what?
Teddy's rebuilding a woman's atrium out of a sack of cow meat.
but you're not nervous at all?
you're lucky.
I get to watch an intestinal perf repair.
Bailey won't let me operate till I get this bullet out.
I'll take it out. I'll cut it out right now.
you sound like a junkie.
what the hell is a pimpernel?
kerry wants to know how Warren's doing?
intestinal perf. Going to surgery.
I'm never gonna operate again.
everyone thinks I'm gonna carve my initials into a patient.
I'll never operate aga because one man thinks I'm crazy.
Hey, guys, look at this. Look at this.
a bystander's cell phone captured the shocking end to a flag football practice in lawton park this morning.
we've got that amazing footage, plus all your news traffic and weather, coming up after this.
Oh, my god. She never saw it.
no.
$50 says she back in the cuckoo's next by lunch.
Hey, how was your night in jail?
you shank someone right off the bat?
you gotta let the other cons know not to mess with you.
that's not funny.
they almost charged me with reckless endangerment.
I'm sorry, What?
you mean that's where you've been all morning, in jail for reckless endangerment?
nobody was endangered.
I can't have this, Derek. I will not. Now
have you ever been over 120 miles an hour before?
Richard, have you ever been over 80?
it's fun.
it's really fun.
I mean, especially when you go through a corner like that at that speed, and-- And you're not sure if the rear end's gonna stick or not, and you lose control, and then you put the throttle down, and the car corrects a little bit, and you take it to the limit and you don't lose control, you just grab it.
have you ever done it?
uh, uh, no, Derek, no.
you want to? I'll take you.
you should. It's... Really great.
let's go right now. Let's do it. Come on.
I'd like that.
right? Good. We're going.
you need to help me. I need your help.
what? Okay.
she's paralyzed, and it's not gonna go away. She's not gonna get any better.
Lexie, hold on. You're all right.
no, n-not me. It's Kerry Schultz.
she got hit outta nowhere, and it's not gonna get any better.
I need you to listen to me.
look, this has nothing to do with that. She's
no, just shut up and please listen to me.
make sure she's all right.
I'm trying.
120 miles an hour.
I'm glad you're back, that we're gonna be in there together.
it makes me a little less freaked out is what I'm saying.
is this gonna become a thing You sharing l your sad, scared feelings because we almost got shot together?
there it is.
now I know you're back.
this boy got it bad.
okay, throw a stitch in there.
suction.
staph infection, which causes cellulitis, an abscess, possibly mrsa, which could lead to sepsis and death.
uh, I'm sorry. Where are you seeing all of this?
in Dr. Karev's chest if he doesn't have that bullet removed.
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. Can I leave now?
no, you can stand right there to make sure you don't get into anyone else's o. r. not until you're lead-free.
all right.
the heart is ready.
okay.
here we go.
start the clock.
Dr. Yang... Take the heart, please.
badass.
all right.
here we go.
excising the right atrium.
welcome back, Dr. Yang.
thank you.
see? You went down before the lightning even struck.
Oh, my god. Warren. I never even saw him coming.
is he okay?
he's in surgery now.
kerry, your new scan shows an epidural hematoma.
it's blood in your spine that's compressing your spinal cord.
we didn't see that before?
probably too small to see, and it's been bleeding for hours.
it's an easy procedure to relieve the pressure.
and I'll walk again?
you'll be out on the field in no time.
book an o. r.I'll see you in there.
F - for an actual surgery?
Yes.
thank you.
Oh, so stupid.
all this time... I never told him.
and I-I had all these reasons, you know?
and... They seemed like good reasons until we all almost died.
I was worried about, what, about shaking up the team?
it's flag football.
we play once a week.
God, I'm an idiot.
I thought you were in surgery.
Yeah, the guy pulled through.
is Lexie okay?
why don't you ask her yourself?
she doesn't need me talking to her.
well, you're the one who ended it.
Yeah, it ended the way it always ends.
I get close to the chick, the chick goes crazy.
Rebecca and Izzie, my mom-- I'm a lightning rod for this crap.
you're not that special.
Lexie's not crazy.
she had a crazy thing happen to her, and her reaction was pretty normal.
and Izzie had brain cancer.
Rebecca-- she was crazy, but that was the facial reconstruction trauma.
you're not a lightning rod, Alex.
you're just a guy who's been through a lot of crap.
I wish I had a scalpel right now.
junkie.
time, please.
2 hours and 42 minutes.
we're behind. Dr. Hunt, where are you at?
putting in the aortic graft.
this tissue is more than I need.
Dr. Yang, trim this pericardium, please.
3 centimeters.
okay.
Avery, give me some irrigation in here, please.
sure.
sorry.
all right. Are we all right?
it's all right.
it was just a tray.
the aortic cannula is dislodged.
Avery, some suction in here, please.
hunt, talk to me.
I need a purse string in the aorta.
Avery, get me some more visualization in here, please.
get in there. - Yang, come help me.
Cristina, talk to me.
Oh, damn it. Grab the aortic cannula. Hold it there.
Cristina, you are okay.
can you get up?
Avery, I need that tissue now.
is it usable? - no.
No!
time, please.
time! - Uh, 2 hours, 45.
all right, Avery, call down to the pharmacy and get another piece of tissue, please.
no, don't call. Cristina. Cristina, you go.
go now and get one. Run. Go.
look, I'll just go. I got it.
the dura is pulsatile.
good catch, Dr. Grey.
thank you, and, um, thank you for listening to me and for not being afraid of me.
nobody's afraid of you.
mark's keeping me chained to his service.
he's keeping me out of surgeries.
because he's afraid for you.
so he hovers.
other people might lock you in a cell overnight to be urinated on by a meth head.
but it all comes from the same place.
you-you can't be in here.
but we're friends now, so I'll just shut up.
good girl.
Dr. Grey, you shouldn't be in the o. r。
I can't be in here.
I can't.
okay, so let's go.
let's get out of here.
I can't-- I c-- I can't feel anything.
I know.
I know.
come with me. - No, no.
I... I can't move.
I can't move my legs.
I can't-- I can't feel anything.
um... Uh... F - feel my hand.
take my hand.
do you feel that?
okay.
you're okay.
we're gonna go when you're ready.
okay?
so you tell me when you're ready, okay?
is it over?
how is she?
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.
no, no. No, no-- I-- she's fine.
uh, the doctors are still working, and someone will be out when they're finished.
you're wrong.
sorry?
there's no time to wait.
people get struck by lightning.
people die.
my best friend got shot, Torres.
why are you telling me to give it time when there's no guarantee that time is gonna be there?
I'm... Not gonna wait around to be happy anymore.
all right. Listen, this is something that you and I do.
we skip steps.
okay, I pushed Arizona to have a baby, and I almost lost her because I skipped a bunch of steps.
but then I went back, and now she's moving in... And ruing my apartment.
look, I'm saying, proposing might be too much, especially if she's not herself right now.
I know who she is, and if she's going through her worst right now, I wanna go through it with her.
she makes me happier than... Anything I've ever known.
and if I can have a part in-- in making her happy again, that's all I want to do.
that's all I want to do for the rest of my life.
all right.
all right. Go.
go. Tell her that.
but just like that.
is she dead?
she's fine. She'll be fine.
can you give us a minute?
you were wrong.
you were wrong about everything.
I know. I' sorry.
Hey, I heard about Cristina.
is she all right?
no, she's not all right. No one's all right.
and that idiot is clearing everyone for surgery like they're fine, and they're not fine.
stop. Stop. I need to talk to you. - Just leave it alone, Derek.
it was one night in jail.
you drive too fast. Just forget about it.
I don't want to talk about that.
don't worry about that. - Don't worry about it?
all I do is worry all the time I spend every minute of every day worrying that I'm gonna get a phone call that you've wrapped your car around a pole.
that's why I left you jail, so that just for a little while
I would know that you weren't dying like you were dying on that table.
that's what I think about every time you pull out of the driveway.
I'm right here.
I'm okay. We're okay.
I was pregnant... That day.
I was pregnant, an I lost it.
you didn't say anything.
I coulda helped you.
if you want to help me, your driving isomething you can control.
just do that. Just do that.
what happened in the o. r,we couldn't have seen that.
I- I can't... I can't do it.
you said I could do it. - I know. I know.
I... I thought you were ready.
you've never not been ready.
Cristina, I know what you're feeling.
I don't feel anything.
I can't be in there.
and if I can't be in there, I don't know where I'm supposed to be.
you're supposed to be here. You're my wife.
you can just be here.
I'm sorry.
you up for a visitor?
Kerry? - Oh, my god. Warren?
are you okay?
um, they-- they told me that I slammed you really hard on the field and
Oh, it's okay. Cidents happen. It's-- it's football.
I'm fine. - Well, they also told me that i.
I got you all struck by lightning.
that's-- i-- That's-- - I just-- I wanted to say, i'm sorry.
I'm not.
I love you.
I've been in love with you forever.
Dr. Grey, can you please push me a-a little closer?
lightning doesn't often strike twice.
it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
even if it feels like the shock is coming over and over again.
you paged me?
I did. I have a surgery.
you're actually gonna let me near a patient?
you are the patient. Get in there and get on that table.
Oh-- I don't need a reminder of this thing.
I'm gonna carry that day around with me every day for the rest of my life whether I want to not.
now they've plastered over every bullet hole in this building.
I don't need a reminder every time I look at you.
and I'm tired of bullying you, so I am asking you, please, get in there and get your shirt off.
Yes, ma'am.
eventually... The pain will go away, the shock will wear off... ...
Oh, hey. You ready to go? I, uh, I pushed our reservation.
do I talk too much?
I mean, to come in here and to listen to people talk and to make them feel good and I just-- I want to be sure that I'm not using you for that you know, and that I'm not doing all the talking and the-- and the good feeling and that I'm-- I'm-- I'm not treating you like a-- like a-- Well, like a... Like a shrink.
well, like a... Like a shrink 'cause I'm enjoy in this.
now you talk.
um... Well... Listening to you is not work.
I'm happy to talk, but I have listened a lot today.
I talked a lot, too.
and so for now, i'd like to say... I'm enjoying this, too.
I'm enjoying this, too.
and, uh... Maybe we can both not talk for a while?
okay. - Yeah. Yeah.
and you start to heal yourself...
Oh. Did you know that Webber went over my head and cleared Yang for your o. r?
we-- We really don't have to-- to talk.
come here. Yeah? - Yeah.
did I forget to clean something?
no. I just need to talk to you.
no... You don't, though.
I know that you want to be here, but you don't have to.
w- wait. - I-- I went through a rough patch and you helped me, and I appreciate that.
but I am moving out of it, and you won't let me.
you know, you're treating me like I am a basket case.
and-- and-- and everyone is watching you, and they're believing you.
I had a good day today.
I saved a girl today. I did that.
I am a good doctor, and I don't deserve for people to think that I am anything less than that.
so could you please just leave me alone?
can you do that? Can you just leave me alone?
you got it.
to recover from something you never saw coming.
Charles was a good guy. He was funny.
reed... Well, she was kind of messe up, but she wasn't a bad person.
I just don't-- I don't know why...
I shouldn't just get to walk away, you know?
I don't know why we made it either.
we just have to find a way to be grateful.
son of a bitch.
agreed.
paint it beige.
you got a girl... You love who loves you back.
paint it whatever stupid color she wants.
but sometimes, the odds are in your favor.
50% of marriages end in divorce so between the two of us you and Mcdreamy should be fine.
I thought it would fix me.
that's not why he married you.
well, he didn't marry me. He married a corpse. I'm dead inside.
I told Derek.
about the miscarriage, I told him.
you got married, cristina, for better or for worse.
this is the worse part.
the thing is, there will be better parts.
you should go back.
yeah? - Yeah.
you don't feel nothing. All right?
you didn't feel nothing today.
you felt scared. You were terrified. And you felt anger.
you were angry at me.
and after what you've been through, you're allowed, all right?
that's what you should be feeling. I know.
because when I was there, I felt all those|things, and I... I took it all out on you.
I took it all out on you.
and you were patient, and you were kind, and you stayed through it all because you love me. You love me.
so, uh... You can be scared with me, or you can be pissed with me or at me.
I don't care,'cause I'm gonna stay through it all.
I'm not going anywhere, Cristina.
I'not going anywhere without you.
let's go home.
I had already fixed her before you came, but...
that was a nice speech.
if you're in just the right place at just the right time.
you can take a hell of a hit...
I lost a baby, I almost lost my husband, and my best friend may never recover.
so I don't care what you do.
clear me or don't clear me.
I have no control over any of it. I'm giving up.
well...
that sounds like a good plan.
you're cleared for surgery, Dr. Grey.
and still have a shot at surving.
they watch us practice on frogs...
and pigs, and dead people, and then live people.
they drill us relentlessly.
they raise us like children.
and eventually, they take a cold, hard boot, and they kick us out of the nest.
I have great faith in you... Great faith.
I I've watched you work.
U, I know what you can do.
that's why today is different.
the training wheels are coming off, people.
I'm throwing down the gauntlet today, people.
I've got a $1-million surplus and one department gets it.
you know what you need, and know what you need.
now I want to know what you want.
and I'm gonna keep the residents busy, very busy.
so that'll give you time to put your best foot forward.
navy scrubs? - Attending scrubs.
you are attendings today.
run the cases, take point, but don't be a fool.
if you get in over your head, cry uncle.
until then... Congratulations. You've just been promoted.
um, chief Webber.
uh, sorry. I-I didn't get any scrubs.
Oh, this is for fourth-year residents only, Grey.
it's just a regular day for you.
well, fine.
well, if they're gonna be attendings, then that makes me chief resident.
no. That makes you our scut monkey.
no, it doesn't.
does-does it? It doesn't.
the attendings aren't going anywhere.
we're basically just playing dress up.
Yeah.
here you go. - Thank you.
are you sure this is a good idea?
of course it is.
we all did it.
it's the evolution of the craft, the passing of the torch, the lifeblood of the training process.
here you go. Here you go.
pray, people.
we want god in the building today.
what time are we pitching you? - Yeah, is there an order?
you people are adults. You decide the order.
I decide whose department gets the $1 million.
love a good dogfight.
he can be intimidating once you get in the room.
Rely? - Oh, yeah.
when I pitched my cartilage research last year, he was all ticked off cause I had a typo in my table of contents.
y - You had a table of contents?
what?
I love a good dogfight, too.
it's my case. Are you gonna hand me over the chart?
what factors would lead a patient to want breast reduction surgery?
uh, neck pain, back pain, balance issues.
hand it over. - Keep trying.
I don't know. Maybe she's a prude, uh, doesn't want everyone staring at her all the time.
maybe she's embarrassed.
no, but you're getting warmer.
Hi, I'm Dr. Karev.
Mindy Gruberman. Nice to meet you.
I can work with that.
she's not the patient.
Dr. Robbins. So you'll be on my service, too, huh?
Dr. Karev's gonna be our team leader today.
excuse me.
honey. Quit futzing with the gown. Come out here.
the doctors want to see you.
what's up?
ms. Radigan, you're still having these headaches and ringing in the ears?
all day long. It's driving me crazy.
it's caused by a buildup of fluid in your skull.
so what we will do is insert a shunt, and that will relieve the pressure on your brain.
what do you mean,"we"?
you're doing the actual tube part in the brain, right, n - not them?
excuse her. She's a schoolteacher.
she talks to everyone like they're hiding gum behind their back.
that's all right. She can ask questions.
Dr. Grey and Dr. Avery are residents.
they're very talented.
one of them will be performing the procedure, and I will be observing.
a trainee cutting into Ellie's brain?
no.
I know it sounds like a leap, but these doctors study and assist for years.
at some point, we have to let them operate.
that's how we make new surgeons.
let them learn on someone else.
who, someone who's too scared to interrogate the doctors?
they have to learn on someone.
might as well be an old lady.
you're my old lady.
this should be my call.
I won't let them move a muscle without my direction and approval.
you're a teacher, Joanne.
let the kids learn.
she's my life.
she has been my life for 40 years.
do you hear me?
I hear you.
who gets to cut?
I want to get a look at both of you with a drill before I decide who gets the shunt.
skills lab seems like a fair way to go.
competing with the wife? Like that's not a stacked deck.
well, it's a game, really.
so all you have to do is win, which you won't.
I don't like the idea of teenagers getting plastic surgery.
if the growths were on his face, you wouldn't have a problem with him wanting them removed.
Yeah, but I might have a problem with Karev removing them.
I'll give you that.
what happened?
Karev's about to do a gynecomastia surgery on a 13 year old.
Oh, karev's fine. He's done way bigger procedures than that.
you two would just rather worry about him than about your, uh, presentations to the chief.
Oh, yeah. I'm not worried.
the money is going to the tiny humans. No one ever says no to the tiny humans.
what?
well... You're not gonna cry 'cause you find the chief intimidating?
no. - Good. Good.
all right. I have work to do. - OKay.
Bye.
what, are you trying to psych her out?
ortho needs the money.
she and the frigging tiny humans have all the help they need already.
I'm getting the money. Let it go.
Oh, okay.
why wouldn't i?
well, because you never prepare for anything.
you think you'll get by on your goodlooks and charm and the brilliance that pops off the top of your head.
Yeah,cause it always works.
Roy Henley, 57, was admitted 2 days ago with severe wheezing from pulmonary hypertension, - which basically means... - I can't breathe for crap.
we're gonna run some tests.
that should help us decide how to proceed.
you can run all the tests you want, but what I need's new lungs.
my doctor said I was gonna need 'em one day, but I was too healthy for it.
I bet I'm not too healthy now.
Dr. Yang?
we'll run some tests.
uh, Mr. Henley, you listed your daughter as your emergency contact.
is she here with you today?
Oh, no. She lives over in Aberdeen.
I don't want to trouble her.
is there anyone here with you?
I'm a tough old dog.
I don't need a chaperone.
sir, your-your condition is serious.
it might be time to trouble your daughter.
do we think he's a transplant candidate?
do we?
well, at this point, I don't think there's anything else we can do, right?
Dr. Yang, do you agree?
I don't know.
you don't know if you agree?
he'd have to be approved by the transplant team before going on the waiting list.
do we convene a panel?
yang, do we?
I couldn't say.
he's running out of time. I say we convene the panel for today.
okay, convene the panel, and then what?
I get some interns to order mr. Henley's tests.
on it.
Dr. Yang.
I don't know?
but taking point right now is... - I am not asking you to be in an o. r.
I am asking you to say something, to participate.
we're at a crossroads, Yang, a crossroads where you either get in the game...
or I tell Richard it's time to send you home.
Imagine-seattle grace, the hospital that made heart surgery obsolete.
that's a... Big claim.
well, if the five million americans who suffer from heart failure could simply just regenerate their own damaged hearts - I mean, it sounds like magic, but it-it's possible. It's happening.
Dr. Altman, stem cell research is on the cutting edge of every field of medicine.
why cardiao?
well, cardio and-and neuro are the beacons of the hospital.
they're what put you on the map.
look, you know what? You-you can't give this money to neuro.
I mean, neuro isn't even really a-a department.
it's just one strong surgeon.
you're better off putting your money on to a deeper bench.
what do you mean?
well, shepherd, he's like a charismatic cult leader.
he's very appealing and he's got a bunch of people hiding in his shadows, but-well, don't get me wrong, he is a great surgeon, and he can pull off a flashy procedure, but is he really cultivating talent?
is he taking the time to teach your residents, knowing when to push and dishing out tough love when-when they need it?
I mean, that's the hard part.
I - I don't know. Maybe shepherd just doesn't like competition.
I mean, he tried to fire me.
well, I mean, not that I'm holding a grudge or anything.
well, not - Not much of one anyway.
I'm, uh, uh... Well, I-I feel like I should've stuck to my notes.
is Teddy saying you could be fired?
sounded that way.
well, is she trying to scare you?
is it working? - I don't think so.
Oh, damn it. - problem?
Derek's got us competing for a brain shunt insertion.
the egg is the skull.
you can break the shell, but you can't break the membrane.
damn it!
I feel bad for him. He's kind of losing it.
I shouldn't be in charge of anybody.
just put one foot in front of the other.
just get through the day.
you broke my concentration.
sorry.
um, hey, uh, post-ops look good, so if there's nothing else...
Oh, could you discharge 12-24?
and his chart needs to be dictated.
uh, yes, it's gonna have to wait until after I check on Torres' knee girl, turf the window jumper to psych, remove a june bug from some kid's ear in the pit, write some meds for screaming-kidney-stones guy, and then deliver labs to my goiter lady.
stop bragging. - I can't.
I was born for this kind of day.
no.
stop.
Seth, no. Okay?
this can wait a couple of years.
mom, you said this was my decision.
you said, after my bar mitzvah, i'd be a man and I could decide.
that is because we thought by 13, you'd make the mature decision.
you can't just cut off the parts of your body that you don't like, all right?
I don't like my thighs, okay?
or my saggy arms or my chin, but if we all cut off the parts we don't like, we'd all have nothing left.
mom! - Seth!
your father has the exact same chest as you, and nobody thinks he's a woman.
look, would you please talk to her?
I'm calling your father.
they call me booby at school.
boobs, double "d.
some kid keeps hanging a bra in my locker.
I'm starting high school in a year.
it's gonna be all new people.
I just want to start or.
I want to be normal... Like everyone else.
why can't we just skip the panel?
we know I need the lungs.
not everyone makes a good transplant candidate.
if someone can't reliably take their anti-rejection meds...
I can.
or have severe disease in another organ.
I don't.
Oh, well, there are are just a lot of indicators as to whether a person is strong enough to survive the surgery.
I want to know what she thinks, the one with the sourpuss on her face.
I don't have a sourpuss. This is just my face.
it's true. It is just her face.
you think I'll... Pass the panel?
I couldn't say.
Oh, cheer up, sourpuss.
you're young, you got your health.
I think you're doing all right, both of you.
practically kids and doctors, no less.
I bet your dads are really proud.
I'm from a small town, a farm, actually.
so yes, my dad was over the moon when I became a doctor.
what about you?
Seth's mother just came by saying she wants to pull the plug on the kid's procedure.
that your idea of taking point?
well, I'm-i'm gonna talk to her.
I spent two hours consulting with this family last month.
ten minutes with you, they're ready to walk.
pediatric surgery is 80% parent management, Karev. You know that.
I'm handling it.
Megan, hi.
uh, I am Dr. Grey. Just checking in to see how you're feeling.
she doesn't hear well when she's texting.
I can hear her. Thanks.
Where's the other doctor - Dr. Torres?
Oh, I'll-i'll be checking you today.
how's your knee? Is the, uh, pain any better?
look, you seem really sweet, but this whole, like, super-busy, messy-hair, running-around-like- A- banshee thing you have going doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
I mean, you don't even know my case.
meg Whealon, age 28, tibial plateau fracture caused by a bicycle accident.
at least that's what you told the e. r. but you told Dr. Torres that you were going 30 miles an hour, which makes me think that you were on your boyfriend's motorcycle, and I'm gonna guess that he has a license for it, and you don't.
this is off the top of your head?
I memorized your chart.
your facture was fixed with elevation and percutaneous screw fixture.
you are allergic to penicillin, currently on blood thinners to make sure you don't develop d. v.t. and if you would just talk to me about your knee, then I could adjust your pain meds and be out of your hair.
she's good.
you're good.
I'm busy, but I can handle it.
every doctor in this hospital needs trauma training - Disaster training.
you've got a strong department.
no, no, not just my staff.
everyone.
11 people died in that shooting.
now eight of them... Never had a chance, but the other three could've been saved.
Charles Percy had a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
Miranda Bailey did everything that she was trained to do.
she gave him fluids, controlled the bleeding, applied pressure.
then she tried to get him to an o. r.but she couldn't, and so he died.
now a doctor with disaster training would've been able to assess that environment more quickly and would've known an alternative escape route.
Dr. Bailey was not trained to do that, and neither are 90% of the doctors on your staff.
she'll remember him dying in her arms for the rest of her life.
and I'll remember.
and you'll remember that we could've saved him.
we failed her.
we failed Charles Percy, one of our own doctors.
I can'face that.
I can't face that ever again.
can you?
the burn unit at seattle grace, make us the go-to destination for serious burn victims.
I'd also like to upgrade us to a real nationally renowned center for cosmetic reconstructive surgery.
two subspecialties?
well, revenue from the cosmetic center will help support the burn unit.
one hand scratches the other.
it's a nice idea, and an awfully ambitious plan for $1 million, and a tremendous amount of work.
I'm not seeing anyone right now.
I'm not sleeping with nurses... Residents, attendings, nobody.
so I'm an untapped source of raw power.
I'm telling you, I have the energy of ten men.
so with your $1 million and my untapped stores, we can move mountains.
are you excited? I'm excited.
leave.
right now.
Mrs. Gruberman, every surgery has its risk, but this one is pretty simple.
look, it'll make your son feel a whole lot better about himself.
well, if the surgery is really a good idea, I would like to hear it from dr. Robbins and Dr. Sloan.
look, I'm... - No.
I will speak to Dr. Robbins and Dr. Sloan.
Cristina. Cristina. Roy's labs.
he's got fungal pneumonia, and his creatinine clearance is dangerously low.
I mean, if it gets any worse, we're looking at renal failure.
I'm surprised he was sitting up and talking.
I mean, a-after surgery, couldn't the immunosuppressants kill him?
maybe.
well, okay, I-i-if we don't recommend him, he dies.
but, uh, if we recommend someone who won't survive, then it's just a waste of an organ that could've gone to someone else.
what do you think?
I don't know.
you need to know.
we have to have an opinion. We called the stupid panel.
we have to stand up in front of Teddy...
and the chief and a room full of doctors and recommend whether this guy lives or dies.
it's right down the middle with this guy, like a trick question.
he's a trick patient.
fine. Forget it.
the right opinion, the only opinion that matters is teddy's, so I will just figure out what she thinks, and I will say that.
okay.
d - don't you care at all?
come on. You gotta care.
no, you did not say that to the chief.
it's your fault, you know? You psyched me out.
what? All I ever do is support you.
Oh, look at that face. That's her game face. She's-she's in it to win it.
Oh, hey, Karev, did you talk to Seth's mother?
no, she's thinking about it.
she may want to talk to you guys again.
way to handle it. - What?
I can't force her to listen to me.
keep your face in that book.
it'll inspire confidence.
Oh, my god.
okay, that's getting in seone's head.
I'm just honest.
Oh, I'm up with the chief. I gotta go. - Oh, knock him dead.
Oh, waitre. I brought you tissues, just in case.
Thanks.
you have a sickness.
you do. - What?
okay, 30 seconds.
if neither one of you breaks the membrane, I'm gonna have to judge you on precision, so make sure your initials are clean and clear.
Dr. Shepherd. - yes.
stop talking!
time.
what do you got?
Oh, not bad.
what about you, Dr. Avery?
I just wish I had more time.
Oh, really?
you did your whole name?
What?!
you conned me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
he hustled me.
he went through two dozen eggs and made me think I didn't have to practice.
well, if you didn't practice, Meredith, you were overconfident.
Dr. Avery, congratulations. You have the surgery.
and then I would take the remaining money and invest it in resources for less invasive pediatric cancer surgeries.
even the smallest change could dramatically improve the lives of so many children.
wouldn't that be amazing?
well, that is a very compelling and very focused presentation, dr. Robbins.
you seem surprised. - No. No, not at all.
did you think I was gonna cry?
Yeah.
Torres suggested that I was going to cry as well.
I think that we should all try to wipe the whole crying thing out of our memories.
it happens very rarely, it's...
embarrassing, and-and frankly, I think that I've got it under control.
and the fact that my colleagues treat me as the type of person who would burst into tears in the middle of an important, professional situation, well, that doesn't make me weepy. That makes me mad. Like, violent.
it makes me want to punch someone.
and, you know, I-i'm the daughter of a marine, sir, so I was taught to hit as a child.
I was taught to hit fast and hit hard so you only have to hit once, and now I feel like hitting a person or a wall - No, a person.
let's just circle back to the sweet little children.
here you go. Thank you.
I like the dark blue scrubs on you. You look good.
you okay?
my patient deserves a doctor.
you don't have to cut. Nobody's asking you to.
I know that. I know-I know what's being asked of me, and I'm doing it.
okay, I got an idea.
and I-I think it's gonna help.
you and me, we're gonna go outside...
into the alley behind the hospital, and you're just-you're just gonna kick my ass.
you're gonna knock the living crap out of me.
there you are.
I knew you were in there somewhere.
at the end of this day, good or bad, we're gonna go home together.
whatever it takes to get him home. I just want to get him home.
13 is young for plastic surgery, but your kid's not gonna grow out of it.
he's already gone through puberty, and his father's had the same condition his entire life.
if he had weight to lose, I would advise diet and exercise, but your kid doesn't have a weight problem.
he has breasts.
he needs excision of the glandular tissue.
and yeah, it could wait till he's older, but he's a dude with breasts, and he's headed for high school, and there's no reason he should be subjected to the psychological damage that comes from years of taking schoolyard crap.
look, you want your kid to be a man?
let him make his own decisions.
any other questions?
I got a page. Is everything okay?
something's wrong. First she had a headache, and then
I can't see. Everything is blurry.
okay, look right here.
I am freaking out. Tell me I don't need to freak out.
the whole left side of my body feels weird.
I thought it was because I fell asleep on it, but it's tingling.
okay, squeeze my hand.
she had knee surgery. What the hell is going on?
I don't know yet, but I'm gonna order a head c. t. and then I am going to page for a neuro consult.
looks like you're gonna get to see another doctor today after all.
the minute I hand you this drill, you're on your own.
you may have hustled Dr. Grey, but you better not have hustled me.
this is not a game.
this is a real brain.
I got it.
I'm ready.
Dr. Shepherd, Lexie Greys paging for a consult, repeatedly.
I'm in surgery.
Dr. Grey.
well, are you sure?
I wouldn't want to be overconfident.
cardio is not my thing.
what?
neuro is my focus, and this is cardiothoracic, and I've had relatively little experience with cardiothoracic.
and yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna walk in there today and humiliate myself, or humiliate you, or teddy, or the chief.
you know, really, anyone who could possibly be humiliated by my failure is gonna be humiliated today.
he was admitted two days ago.
Teddy could've convened a panel yesterday, but she didn't.
she doesn't think he's a candidate.
no, she doesn't, so just say that, and you'll be fine.
everyone will be fine except for Roy, who will be dead.
way to kill a happy moment.
Where's shepherd? I paged shepherd. - You got me.
are you her boss?'cause there's something seriously wrong here.
I am. Sir, I need you to go to the waiting room right now.
but I... - Right now.
sir, come with me.
okay, um, she's- she's post-op day two from a tibial plateau fracture.
She-she was fine all day, fine, and then ten minutes ago, she started complaining of headache, blurred vision and tingling on the left side of her body.
I - I ordered a stat head c. t.
I cannot believe that you're the neuro consult.
is she on blood thinners? - Yes, for. v.t. Prophylaxis.
she's got a brain bleed.
let's book an o. r.
how didn't I see this coming?
did you check her platelets? - yes.
and everything was normal? - Until now, yes.
okay, well, you checked her platelets, you got a c. t.you called neuro. You did everything right.
the only thing you're doing wrong is standing around talking about it, wasting time, while we should be getting her to the o. r.
you totally sounded like an attending.
right? Let's page shepherd 9-1-1.
okay.
Dr. Shepherd, it's Dr. Grey again.
just passing the ventriculostomy tube now.
almost there.
all right. Take your time, Dr. Avery. You want to make sure that
damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
are you kidding me?
what did you do?
and that is why the future of ortho is in xenografting.
you think I'm nuts.
you're thinking, I don't want some cow ligament in my leg.
that sounds wacky.
is that supposed to be my voice?
no.
that's the... The voice of the average baby boomer.
I was hoping for something more... Inspirational.
for-for example, Dr. Robbins suggested that we take a little
tiny humans.
what?
arizona's nicer than I am.
I'm-I'm sorry.
she's more patient. She went to hopkins.
she's more i'm-renowned in her field.
she's a much better lesbian.
I mean, I was sort of a late bloomer in that area, but she's got this whole circle of lesbian friends, you know?
it's just like - Like this suulture.
and, uh, I'm always just... I'm always just a little bit left out, just a little bit talked down to because I have a long history of enjoying sex with men, which I don't think is something I have to apologize for.
whatever. I'm just- She's just-she's... She's just better.
so you want me to give ortho $1 million to level the playing field in your relationship?
also for the xenografting, which, as I mentioned, is...
the future of sports medicine.
can I ask you something?
are you one of those, uh, you know, what do you call 'em?
when someone's really smart, like a genius, but they're a little different, like they don't know how to talk to people?
are you asking me if I'm autistic?
that's the word.
Oh, come on.
you barely said three words all day.
don't be offended.
you're a tough nut to crack.
I like that about you.
my daughter's the same way.
were you able to make contact with her?
Oh, yeah. She's not coming.
I'm not all that surprised.
you know, messy divorce. She sided with her mom.
I mean, I hate it, but I get it.
life goes on.
so it's just you and me, sourpuss.
Dr. Yang, the, uh, panel is gathering now.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
hold on one second.
this is gonna go my way, right?
I mean, they just don't send people home to die?
I want to live.
we'll let you know.
is there anything I can do or
I don't know, Avery. Is there anything you can do?
thank you.
where are you? - Uh, we're having a problem.
I'm fixing it now.
okay, I've got a post-op ortho patient on d. v.t. Prophylaxis with a subdural hematoma.
Derek, she's got a blown pupil.
I'm not gonna be there for a while, so you gotta take care of it yourself.
what? - You wanted a solo surgery today.
now's your chance. Take point.
I need loops and a headlight. - Here you go, doctor.
okay, scalpel.
if I root against him, does that make me a bad guy?
the patient's a child Mark.
all right, Karev, you got this. If you don't, we're right here.
all right, people, here we go.
10-blade.
okay.
you're letting Kepner lead the transplant panel?
well, yang's been useless.
she's no better than an intern.
did you just stop that bleeder?
how did you even know to do that?
okay. Sorry I'm late.
that's okay. Lexie made a good. I've got it under control.
what do we got?
let me finish, Derek. I got this.
Yes, you do.
I'm gonna find a cure for alzheimer's.
the cure for alzheimer's... With $1 million?
with $1 million. It's a start.
you're talking about a clinical trial, a clinical-surgical trial?
Yes.
start-up costs alone, never mind the f. d.a.Derek, it's
today I watched Meredith perform an emergency craniotomy by herself.
she was perfect.
she's got her mother's talent.
she's got her mother's looks, Richard.
what if she has her mother's disease?
Ellis was young when it started.
every time Meredith forgets her keys or asks what day of the week it is, I...
when that $1 million runs out, investors are gonna throw money my way for the same reason
I am gonna throw everything I got at this trial, because their dad has it, or their wife.
breakthroughs don't happen because of the medicine.
real breakthroughs happen because someone is scared to death to stop trying.
they're gone?
well, there's some swelling, but that should go down with some time.
I don't have boobs.
I - I don't have boobs?
you don't have boobs.
mom.
she was scared. Now she's just happy you're okay.
you're the man.
no, you're the man.
Roy Henley has end-stage pulmonary hypertension.
he has reached the point of no return, and at this point, nothing short of a lung transplant will save him.
unfortunately...
unfortunately, his cultures revealed that he has fungal pneumonia, his liver enzymes are worrisome, and on top of everything else, his creatinine clearance is only 75, which means that he is on hisay to kidney failure.
the immunosuppressants after surgery coulvery likely kill him, and so... With regret, I conclude that he does not belong on the waiting list.
Dr. Kepner, if you don't believe he's a candidate, why in the world would you convene a panel today?
that is... A very good question, chief.
I did think that he was a candidate earlier in the day, but the longer I looked at his criteria, the more glaring it became.
it became glaring the more you looked at it?
well... Also, um, n-new facts came to light.
um... The patient has no support system.
uh, no one to take him for post-op visits, or make sure that he complies with his meds.
Ear-earlier in the day, he said he had a daughter, but later it came out that they're estranged.
that's not a reason.
Dr. Yang... Do you have something to add?
no.
you don't believe that having a support system in place is an important factor in this decision?
it's one factor.
this guy is borderline, I mean, that's why we're here.
we could talk about his criteria allay.
I mean, his creatinine clearance is low but not critical, and his-his- His fungal pneumonia is bad but treatable.
I mean, he's borderline.
but I've been involved in 27 transplant surgeries, and every time, the patient's will to fight is just as telling, and Roy has it.
if we give him the lungs, it won't be a waste, cause he will live.
I know it.
so how am I... What am I supposed to say to her?
that I botched the insertion and-and then, uh, I punctured the vessel, or maybe that an error was made, or
you don't tell her anything. You made a mistake.
it happens all the time.
I had to yell at you because that's my job.
my job now is to-our job now is to go in there with smiles on our faces and tell her the surgery was a success, because it was.
there they are, hey. How are our heroes.
the ringing stopped.
it stopped.
that's fantastic news.
and the kid did good, right?
the kid did good.
I'm kissing you now, cause I was wrong.
but in this moment, I am in love with you.
Oh, thank you.
we were supposed to be a team today.
you told me what to say, and then you just turned on me?
I didn't plan it.
I'm not used to failing.
neither am i.
I know you think recommending him was the wrong decision.
I'm sorry, but I just... Didn't agree.
Cristina, in a case like this, the right decision... Is making a decision.
that's what we do. That's the job.
you formed an opinion and you argued for it.
and you weren't alone.
the panel voted to put him on the list.
Congratulations. You were a doctor today.
all right. Talk to me.
um, there is a broken c. t.Machine in the basement, next to it is a broken argon laser and a broken fluoroscope.
I think $1 million would repair all 3 of them.
and there might even be enough money left over to put a new nurse on the night shift, which is what our patients really need.
that's it?
that's what you got for me?
that's your best idea?
this assignment couldn't have been clearer- Inspiration, good, old-fashioned competition.
not you coming in here telling me I need to fix what's old and broken.
um, I would love to go to Paris, but you don't see me sitting around planning my parisian vacation.
it sounds nice, but I am a mother, and what I really need to do is get my kid to preschool, get the laundry done, put food on the table.
all right, I can do a big tap dance here about how I'm gonna change the face of medicine with $1 million, but come on, you can't do anything with $1 million.
$1 million is nothing.
that's a dream.
preschool, laundry, food -.
I'm realistic.
change the face of medicine...
we need to fix the medicine that we already have.
we need a new night nurse.
we need these broken machines repaired.
let's not go to paris.
let's go to the grocery store, chief.
and while we're being honest, why are you wasting our time with this exercise anyway when you and I both know you don't have $1 million?
well, things may be a little different around here in the next few weeks.
look at that.
now I can't call you sourpuss anymore.
give me your arm, Roy.
I have to draw some blood.
we all want to grow up.
we're desperate to get there, to grab all the opportunities we can...To live.
we're so busy trying to get out of that nest...
really freak in' cold.
thank you, sir.
Congratulations.
good job.
because growing up sometimes means leaving people behind.
Congratulaons, doctor.
Thanks.
Oh, damn it. Where are my keys?
they're in your hand.
and by the time we stand on our own two feet...
we're standing there alone.
work keeps our minds active.
it keeps us out of trouble.
13 seconds to run a low-exposure, high-resolution, full-body x-ray.
when this e. r. reopens tomorrow, this thing is gonna save us time, money, and lives.
say that first part again.
what, 13 seconds for a full-body x-ray?
we're gonna be able to do a complete evaluation of, uh, g.s. w.s, stabbings, crush injuries, without ever having to leave this e. r.
do you like your new toy?
Yeah.
then shut up and thank me for it.
when we're not working our hands are idle, and the devil will find work for idle hands to do.
need any help?
Nope. uh, it's on.
you ready?
I won't be wearing it with a t-shirt and underwear.
Oh, no, no, no.
you should only wear it with a t-shirt and underwear.
or nothing...
would be even better.
okay, I have to practice walking on it for a while...
if I want to wear it to work.
Yeah, totally.
and when you have an idle mind, well, that's the devil's playground, too.
it was wet and cold.
I got the flu.
and I couldn't wait to go again.
that was the first time I went fly-fishing.
has he stopped kicking?
for the moment.
her eyesight is developing this week.
unless it's not.
unless she's blind. - She's not blind.
or he's not. Or if he or she is blind, that's fine.
blind is fine.
what do we call it,"it"?
one of us can say "he," one of us can say "she," and we're covered.
well, no, because then it's gonna be born thinking one of us is always wrong.
...that I'm the one well, maybe it can't hear anyway.
maybe it's deaf.
deaf is fine.
Helen keller went to Harvard, Meredith.
okay, well, what if it's not fine?
what if it's absorbed a twin body?
two heads, extra arms
stop.
I'm just saying, if anyone's gonna have a baby with two heads and three arms and 11 toes, it's gonna be me.
would you just go to sleep?
please.
sleep.
we own a hospital.
Yeah, we have for several weeks now.
Yeah, but today it has an e. r.
and, uh, coffee sleeves with the new logo on them.
we needed the coffee sleeves, right? they're a good expense?
Oh, yeah, for branding.
we had a 17-hour meeting about it.
I love the new logo. it really catches the eye.
and, uh, these coffee sleeves
excellent thermal retention.
what's up with the sheet?
I thought you guys put it there for some kind of unveiling.
no. - well, somebody should say a few words, right?
I mean, it's unlucky not to.
Hey, why are you guys staring at the wall?
Oh, we're waiting for the...
big unveiling.
well, you should be staring at my wife.
new haircut?
no. It's her leg. She's wearing high heels.
because she has a sexy high-heel leg that makes her ass go pow.
okay. baby got back.
come on, guys. You can comment, too.
you have permission. It's the one time in your life you can say it...
no. And, uh, not be gross.
well, I think it's a fine gluteal
Oh, no. Yeah. let's just do the unveiling.
no. Yeah.
um, guys, I think the painters actually just left that there.
let's get back to work.
Oh, okay. - end of speech.
awesome. We are awesome.
did you see our picture in this?
I'm at 28 weeks and I am worried about digeorge syndrome.
Digeorge?
there's, like, what, a 1 in 100, 000?
it's too rare.
more likely It'll have a cleft palate or a heart defect.
wait, if your baby has a heart defect, I will fix it.
what about phenylketonuria?
no, we screen for that at birth and treat it with diet.
what about a giant hemangioma?
like a huge, out-of-control bloodsucker?
now that's a possibility.
or maybe a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.
again, I will operate and do a lung transplant.
we own a hospital
a cutting-edge, research-oriented hospital with an advanced level-I trauma center.
whatever's wrong with your baby, we will fix it.
but you agree, there's definitely something wrong?
Oh, my god. Marcus cho?
who's marcus cho?
uh, uh, he's like a high-functioning moron who was a year behind me at stanford.
and he just got published with his attending for...
no. no.
for what?
robot-assisted surgery for mitral valve regurgitation!
he looks kinda smart.
he's a moron.
I heard there was an o. b. using forceps during a breech delivery.
pulled a little too hard and...pop.
now that's what I'm talking about.
we'll let these fluids go in for a few hours and then, uh, set you up for chemo this afternoon.
who's gonna set me up, you or Dr. Wilson?
Dr. Wilson. she's been begging for more time with you.
did you cry?
I have that effect on the ladies.
I'll bet you do.
Hey, sorry. You got a sec?
Yeah. Uh, Pablo, this is Dr. Myers.
Hey, what's up, pablo?
I just want to say, I have that c-section in 20 if you wanted to watch, - unless you're busy. - watch you actually do a real surgery?
Yeah, you can criticize my scalpel technique, which is awesome.
Dr. Karev?
we're slow. I don't care.
uh, this popped out.
is that bad?
sorry.
Hey, don't sweat it, little man.
I'm not little.
I'm 12.
my growth was stunted by a lifetime of cancer.
I'll check in later.
okay?
did you do that on purpose?
is she going out with that nozzle?
I hate him.
well, the guy's a doctor. you can't do that.
you know what else we should do?
what?
and get to know the new electronic board.
it automatically updates the location of your patients and any labs that have been ordered.
and we now have workstations at every bed, which are fully integrated with the new charting system.
and the beds are now numbered differently, so just pay attention.
and now what you have all been waiting for...
low-dose radiation x-ray statscanner.
it provides full-body anterior and lateral views.
the low radiation makes imaging safer for children and pregnant women.
it is our most cutting-edge tool in diagnostic technology.
when can we use it?
I'll volunteer.
when I was 6, I stuck a marble up my nose, and it never came out.
we checked my stool for over a year.
listen, this is not a toy.
I know we all want to see this thing in action. but be patient.
the last thing we need is some line forming when some real trauma comes in.
chief hunt, we've got an a. t.v. Accident two minutes out.
and here we go.
Oh, Dr. Avery.
Hey, I know you've been thinking about raising the profile of the hospital.
not today, Dr. Bailey.
today I am going to the e. r. to find something to operate on.
well, I have a proposal for a Grey Sloan human genome mapping program that'll cost less than Chicago's program.
no money. We spent it on the new e. r.
okay, if you and the other board members would just read over the
I am a doctor today, Bailey.
okay. Okay.
what have we got?
16-year-old female. a.t. v. Collision. g.c. s. Is 6.
open depressed skull fracture with active bleeding.
let's take her to lodox.
get a statscan before we take her to trauma.
they're using the lodox.
Oh, someone say "lodox"?
got here just in time.
sweet. This is gonna be great.
all right, everyone.
let's get ready for this transfer.
all right, on my count.
hold on.
she's bleeding through these bandages.
Ross, a.b. p. Pads.
got it.
it looks like it's a branch of the m. c.a.
pressure's not gonna tamponade it.
we need to get her straight to the o. r.
uh, page Shepherd.
Ross, you're on this.
she's right here. - what about the lodox?
she needs an intraoperative c. t.
it'll only take 13 seconds.
we don't have 13 seconds to spare.
she could stroke out at any second.
let's move! let's go!
you guys want to look for my marble?
Mr. Kramer.
our best neurosurgeon--Dr. Shepherd--Just started operating on your daughter.
you're gonna fix her, right?
well, she sustained a lot of damage to the brain.
since she wasn't wearing a helmet
she was wearing a helmet.
we have been riding every weekend since she was 13 years old.
I would never let her near a bike without one.
we--we stopped to take a picture.
she took her helmet off for a minute, and that idiot comes flying out of nowhere.
I swear to god, I am gonna hunt that son of a bitch down and I am gonna crack his skull open.
we're gonna do everything we can
so what are you standing here for?
get in there!
Dr. Yang, you got a sec?
um, I don't. I'm looking for Dr. Russell.
well, I'm looking for funding.
you're pitching me now?
Yeah. You're on the board.
and I have been postponing research to write policy to become, like, a lawyer, while people like Marcus Cho are out there doing it.
we should be doing it.
don't you want this hospital to be on the cutting edge of medical research?
exactly. - We're on the same page.
okay. Then you'll fund my genome project.
what? No. I need to find some badass, earth-shattering cardio research I can get in on.
okay-- I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Dr. Russell, I need to be put to work.
I need to know what research projects you have pending
great. What are you doing this afternoon?
I think I have just the procedure for you.
I got a page.
do you know who need a g. y.n. Consult?
no, I don't know.
Dr. Grey.
do you need a g. y.n?
Nope.
then who paged me?
can I help you?
well, I noticed your patient has acute abdominal pain.
any chest pains?
because if you wanted to put her through the lodox for a full body scan, you could.
if you wanted, you know, to...
use the lodox.
do I need a full body scan?
it only takes 13 seconds.
no, you don't.
no lodox. Thank you.
so recently, the pain has been getting worse?
I thought I had the stomach flu.
I drown myself in that sanitizer stuff, but when you're teaching kids, oh, they're just little germ bags.
Ah, I've been out for a week.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's been great for me.
I haven't taken a day off in 28 years.
you know how many, um, cooking shows they have now?
I don't.
it turns out, I love watching people cook things.
and then this morning, the pain was so bad, I couldn't move, so I-I called the ambulance.
okay, madeline, so from what I'm seeing here, it looks like gallstones.
Oh, god. does that mean surgery?
it does. but the good news is, we can do it laparoscopically, which means no big incisions and very little recovery time.
and I'll take them out, and you'll be on your way.
well, I get to watch some more people cook stuff.
okay, so I'm gonna get them started on admitting you.
you just sit tight. - great. Thank you.
did you just update your patient file?
watch this.
so cool!
you do get excited about things.
Yes, I do.
Hey, how's that baby?
Oh, it probably has three arms and a tail.
how's your paramedic boyfriend?
terrible.
I mean, um, great. Perfect. Just not
I probably have to break up with him.
Why?
okay, are--Are you really asking?
because I really need to talk about this.
well, now I'm not sure I'm asking.
okay.
uh, Matthew's never...Been to the carnival.
and he thinks that I haven't either because that's what I told him, but I have.
I'm sorry. and you want to go to the carnival together?
because I've been already and I...
rode the rides.
you went to the carnival with Jackson.
I have ridden the rides...
and they are good
the tilt-a-whirl and then that one that spins around when your back is up against the wall and then the floor falls out from underneath your feet.
and I want Matthew to go with me, but he wants to wait, which is...
why he's perfect, because that's what I want.
I always wanted to wait, but I didn't wait.
and now I just
every night push him closer and closer.
and I feel like i'm just gonna slip and buy him a ticket and shove him on the tilt-a-whirl, and then he's gonna love it, and I will have corrupted him.
and I-i'm not a corrupter.
well, I don't know why you're talking to me about this.
I am a big fan of the carnival and I go every chance I get.
Yes, I know, but
okay, so your whole thing is, uh, god has a plan, right?
Yeah.
well, there must be a reason why god let you go to the carnival already.
maybe you're supposed to take Matthew.
you're right, I should not be talking to you about this.
fancy new e. r.and all I've done is splint a pinkie?
this is why we bought a hospital?
if--if we get off...
at a decent time, um, and we put sofia down early, and I could make dinner, and we could, um...
Really?
really.
so...
you think tonight?
is definitely the night.
for sex, right? We're talking about sex?
the sexy night.
okay.
ladies, hey, just the two people I was looking for.
uh, walk away, bailey.
no, no, I need to speak to board members, and I remember you all giving me some kind of crap about how the door's always open, so
Oh, but right now it's closed.
one minute. - it's the wrong minute.
are you kidding me?
okay, what happened to the new hospital, run by doctors, all about doctors?
what happened is, my wife's new leg is making her feel sexy.
and we haven't had sex in a long time.
I mean, we've done stuff, don't get me wrong.
but we haven't done other stuff, and other stuff is happening tonight.
so that's what we were talking about when you interrupted us
walking away.
you warned her.
I did.
uh, meredith grey, I want to talk to you about human genome mapping.
right now?
Yes, right now.
I'm operating.
exactly.
I have you cornered. You can't walk away or start talking about the sexual antics you're going to engage in tonight.
but you can listen.
now!
genetic mapping can lead us to developing targeted therapies for diseases.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, precision medicine, where we treat illness at its molecular source instead of just dealing with the consequences.
what's this?
what it is is the future of medicine.
it's a way that we
no, Bailey. Shut up.
please. You're removing a gallstone.
you can do that in your sleep.
no, it's not gallstones.
it's calcified.
okay, well, you'll need to do a biopsy and maybe open her up.
but don't think the worst.
this is a hard mass.
this is cancer.
Oh, crap. it's spread to the liver.
Oh, if she was teaching until last week, it can't be that bad.
all right, if we resect part of the liver maybe we can get it all.
it's worth a try.
Oh, look at that.
it's encasing the hepatic artery and the bile duct.
we could continue, but we can't take the artery.
it's unresectable.
well, let's finish up and close.
you have to take that much off?
I need the exposure.
Oh, there's more damage than we could see on the c. t.
it's been a few hours.
I'd really like to get an update to the father.
okay, but just so you know, he's kind of a big, angry maniac.
Oh, you can handle it.
of course.
I'll just make sure security's close by.
look, ross, this is an arena in which I know you excel.
just start with the positive news, be confident, and don't make any promises you can't keep.
you're my voice out there.
I'll channel you.
it'll be fine.
I'm Derek Shepherd.
it's a beautiful day to save lives.
I'll channel you in my own voice.
thank you.
this is the lotus valve.
we're doing a lotus valve.
this is the lotus valve.
50% of people with aortic valve defects don't survive a year after diagnosis.
but the lotus valve is noninvasive.
it minimizes aortic regurge, doesn't need, uh, balloon inflation or rapid pacing of the heart, so less stress on the body, less blood loss, less
well, you're obviously up to speed.
I've been dying to get in on this ever since you started testing.
outstanding.
the results of phase two have been amazing.
phase three should be a hoot.
God, you can retract and resheath before you deploy.
exactly. That's the best thing about it.
you have total control over the entire procedure.
it's incredibly flexible if you don't get it right the first time.
but I imagine you will.
m-Me?
I wondered if you might like to try your hand at placing the valve.
Oh, my god.
Yes.
thank you, sir.
nobody's tried it yet?
no, not yet.
that is sad.
this is a beautiful machine.
it is sad.
it's like a carnival ride with all the lights turned off, just sitting there going to waste.
it would be so fun
and it cost us a lot of money just to be pretty.
I...don't think god was involved.
the board paid for it, so
and we definitely want it to get used.
okay, one of you two paged me, right?
no, I didn't. - nope.
he went to the e. r. then ortho, then back to the e. r.and then he went to the cafeteria.
the cafeteria?
what a tool.
Oh, wait. Listen.
Dr. Jason myers to proctology.
all right. well, that was fun, but I have actual doctor work to do.
damn.
I got a great idea for the next one.
come on.
but if you want to deny my dying cancer wish...
so I-i'm gonna die from this? Is that what you're saying?
there is no cure for nonresectable late-stage gallbladder cancer.
chemo may give you more time, but it has not been shown to provide a cure.
I'm sorry.
ms. Skurski?
you guys, what are--what are you doing here?
Mr. Arnold said you were in the hospital.
Dr. Grey, these are some of my students, who are supposed to be at their after-school study session now with their substitute.
what are you doing here?
Mr. Arnold sucks.
Lucas, we don't say "sucks'.
sorry. he's just a jerk.
he sends, like, five people a day to the principal's office.
and we never get free time, even after we finish our homework.
and his breath smells really bad.
you're coming back soon, right?
of course.
don't worry. I'm, uh...
I'll be good as new really soon.
isn't that right, Dr. Grey?
Yes.
Yes, that's right.
the good news is her vitals have been stable.
but her injuries are extensive.
we'll be operating for several more hours.
wait. what does that mean, extensive?
uh, it's hard to say.
Susie's suffered damage to the parts of her brain that control speech, motor functions
she's paralyzed?
my--my little girl is paralyzed?
no, no, I mean, paralysis is a possibility, but we can't tell what kind of deficits she'll have until she wakes
what kind of things are you expecting? How bad?
there might not be any. - which one is it, are there or aren't there?
at this time, it's too early
you said she might not be able to speak.
we don't know-- what the hell do you know?
I know this must be scary for you
damn right, because you don't know anything.
don't talk to me till you know what's going on, or get me someone who does!
I know I shouldn't have lied right in my kids' faces.
I kinda pride myself on not doing that.
I just couldn't tell them. I just couldn't.
maybe...
there's a way to help prepare them.
maybe it would make you feel better.
I teach them science and math.
I teach them things that make sense, and this doesn't make sense. I-i...
yesterday, I was... watching tv.
I was happy to have a little break from school, and today, I...
I'm probably not even gonna make it to finals.
their parents will have to tell them.
I... I...
or Mr. Arnold. I-I just don't know what I would say.
this sucks!
we don't say "sucks," but this sucks.
I only have a dog bite and two patients with the flu.
I have a sprained ankle.
Yeah, let's do that. get him in the machine.
he doesn't need a full body scan.
it's a really bad sprain.
I have a stomachache.
stomachache could be a tumor, kidney stones.
no, ihave a stomachache.
okay, how bad is the sprain?
what?
that ass does not quit.
these heels are killing me.
what was I thinking?
I mean, heels were a pain even before I had a plastic leg.
why'd I think it'd be better now?
can I take a look?
Nope.
Oh, well, I just might be able to help.
you're not my doctor. you're my wife.
here we go. - What?
uh, we're not gonna have sex tonight.
who said-- Who said that we're not gonna have sex tonight?
that's what you're saying. you just told me your leg hurts so that tonight when I put on my drop-dead gorgeous underwear, you're gonna tell me to change into my sweats.
what kind of manipulative bitch do you think I am?
you're not manipulative and you're not a bitch. okay?
I'm a bitch. - yeah.
you are uncomfortable like you have been for a very longtime now, a g. y.n. Patient just came in. This time I have a name. Talia.
if you can find her, you can treat her.
I'm looking for a Ms. Talia.
a jenny talia.
I'm here to see jenny talia.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
Yeah.
a moment.
what the hell are you doing?
Dr. Webber, I was
out of all the childish, sophomoric things to do to someone, this may be the most pathetic.
come on.
look at the kid.
he lives in this hospital.
he never gets to have any fun.
what's the big deal?
the big deal is, I thought you were better than this.
Jenny talia?
you need to up your game.
you're cutting right into her frontal lobe.
calm down, Ross.
her whole personality could be affected.
her memory could be gone, and that man out there is gonna kill me.
did I ever tell you the first time I went fly-fishing?
no.
Yeah, I went out to the hoh river to fish winter steelhead.
for hours, I tried to cast like I'd practiced.
but if you over try, it'll never happen.
and then just once, the rod loaded perfectly.
the line formed a tight loop, and the fly just danced out over the river about 70 feet.
it had a life of its own.
see, the key was to relax, feel the rhythm, and let the rod do the work.
just one perfect cast.
why'd you tell me that?
did it calm you down?
Yeah.
right now I am about to remove a hematoma from broca's area.
and if I am not careful, she'll never speak again.
there is a lot to be afraid of.
patients will be afraid. Parents will be afraid.
and the only way to get through it is for you to stay calm.
the brain is swelling.
what are we gonna do about that?
we're gonna...
we're gonna give her more mannitol.
good.
that was amazing.
the valve started operating before I fully released it.
incredible, right?
and almost no paravalvular leakage?
revolutionary technology, and the rate of success with phase two has been astounding.
well, when do we start phase three?
well, that's up to you, really.
up to me?
you're--you're giving phase three to me?
no. No. it's my trial.
I don't need another surgeon.
what I need from you is $12 million so I can keep it going, for patient recruitment, research staff, lab space.
I want to make Grey Sloan the premier destination for this procedure.
I thought you were bringing me on to this.
you're-- You're pitching me.
it's nice to finally have someone on the board who gets what I'm doing.
this is exactly what I was afraid of.
the administrative crap is taking over my career.
Russell called me "someone on the board.
I mean, he doesn't even see me as a surgeon.
I'm just someone who cuts budgets.
stop kicking in there.
I mean, what are you, choking on your cord or something?
Cristina, please talk to it.
he or she. - who?
the baby. - no.
the sound of my voice only makes it kick harder.
for some reason, derek can calm it down.
maybe you can, too.
you know, I'll talk to it when I see it.
when she gets her first period.
I'll take that off your plate.
or if it has a penis, I'll tell him not to think with it.
Cristina, please just talk to it.
hello.
this is...
I don't know. What do you want me to say?
anything. just talk oh, get up.
Hey, uh, this is Miranda Bailey.
I am an excellent surgeon and a forward thinker.
your mother's a surgeon.
your father is a surgeon.
you'll very likely want to be one, too.
but I'm hoping by the time it's your turn, there will be very little surgery left because human genome mapping will have given people information so that they can fight their diseases before they happen.
keep talking. it's working.
um, armed with information, people will be able to live longer, healthier lives.
now I know this is a very expensive undertaking, but maybe if you hadn't spent so much money on coffee sleeves and new logos, there'd be money in the budget to fund a forward thinker like me.
I think she's talking to us now.
look, here is my proposal, which I've made to you because you're in charge.
which is messed up, but I'm not gonna go there because I want your money.
we are in charge.
I am in charge.
I am gonna crush Marcus Cho because I am in charge.
wait. Don't leave. I
Hey, Cristina, please talk to it.
okay, right.
o-okay.
that was the ambulance from earlier.
they thought they left one of their backboards here.
they found it.
all right.
what are you doing?
hop in.
Really?
let's find that marble, and the rest of you, line up and watch.
at the very least, we're going to figure out how to run this damn thing.
chief, we got a motorcycle accident coming in. Extensive crush injuries.
hop out.
but it only takes 13 seconds.
out now. And the rest of you, let's prep for incoming.
is that a specimen cup?
Yeah.
did you place a warm cup of pee next to me?
it's my urine sample.
what, should I go put it on your desk?
if you want to die.
but the memo says that you're in charge of the random drug test policy.
okay, whatever drugs you are doing, stop!
what was that about?
uh, that's what happens when the hospital's slow.
the doctors start punking each other.
well, I just wanted to let you know that we found funding for your project.
Oh, I get it.
you popular kids are punking me, like this is some high school volleyball team.
well, I do not want to play varsity that bad, kimberly.
Bailey, you get your genome lab, for real.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, Cristina just assembled a quick board meeting.
now we haven't dotted all the I's or crossed all the t's yet, but it looks like you're gonna get your funding.
but Avery said there wasn't any more money.
Yeah, well, one of the other departments cut their budget.
you're cutting my budget?
just by a couple million.
I asked you for more money, not less.
I'll have to lose a resident, a-a research assistant
probably two...of each. Sorry.
wait. Wait.
what does that leave me with?
it leaves you with me.
to do the work of four people?
I am the best four people you will ever have working for you.
I will treat your patients, take your surgeries, andassist in research, including projects I find on my own.
feel free to pile it on.
but I can't possibly
Oh, the board believes you can.
well...I told Bailey she's getting her genome lab.
she was so happy.
she looked great.
that's fantastic.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah. I'm just--I'm really happy for Bailey.
no, you're in pain. You've been standing all day. Here. Sit down.
you know, I really--I don't
I don't want to keep saying yes and then not following through with it, okay?
I-I really don't.
no, I'm a jerk for putting pressure on you.
you know what? I think that I can try. I can try.
it's just--I need to adjust this thing.
let me help.
Callie, don't.
I am an orthopedic surgeon.
let me try.
give me your hands.
can you remove your pants, please?
Yeah.
okay, I got you.
okay.
that's not fixing it. that's--That's taking it off!
look at me.
I'm gonna put my hand on your leg.
no, callie. Don't.
the prosthetic is not the problem.
your leg's your problem.
I deal with residual limbs every single day. it's...
they get sore.
Yeah.
is that okay?
it feels better.
you know I could, um...
I could give you a massage, too.
with your girlie hands?
forget it.
thank you, Callie.
right now I'm Dr. Torres.
this came for you.
but...
I don't know if you want to see it.
it's not my call.
they're here, aren't they?
a lot of them.
they're in the lobby.
but I can also say that you can't have visitors.
three, two, one.
all right. he's all set.
Avery, would you do the honors?
look at that.
it's worth every penny.
you can see the fractures of both legs and of the proximal aspect of the right radius and ulna all in the same x-ray.
it would've taken, like, 15 scans to get that much information before.
it's freakin' magical.
it was definitely worth waiting for.
Yeah.
okay. Let's get him out of there.
are you ready?
good news first, stay calm.
can I hear the fishing story one more time?
come on.
what took you so long?
Mr. Kramer, the good news is, your daughter's alive.
until she wakes up
no, no, no. No, don't, don't, don't, don't you do that!
look, sir, please! - You're not gonna tell me that.
you do not--no!
listen!
your daughter...
your daughter is alive, you hear me?
listen to me.
your daughter is alive.
she's alive.
and we hope she's gonna wake up, but we don't know what's gonna happen.
okay?
her vitals are stable.
but it doesn't do you or her any good to be afraid of what we don't know.
let's get cleaned up, and you can go see her, okay?
she always wears a helmet.
she...
I make sure.
I know.
I always... - I know.
I know.
Mr. Arnold always yells. well, he's probably frustrated.
I-I know you don't like him because he's not me, but
but you didn't like me at first, did you?
but at least you gave us free time if we finished our homework.
maybe you should tell him that that's how I did it and that it motivated you.
right?
if... if, um...
Mr. Arnold were
were going to be your teacher for the rest of the year, what else could you do to--to help him?
someone could offer him a mint.
that's a great idea.
but not in a mean way. just--just casually, right?
what else?
don't skip after-school study sessions?
you got it.
but he's not gonna be our teacher for the rest of the year.
is he?
you're not gonna come back...
are you?
what... what would happen if I didn't?
it'd suck.
sorry.
no, you're right.
it'd suck.
now...
what else can we do to help Mr. Arnold?
come on. Help me think.
what happened to cool and calm?
Yeah, well, that never would've worked with a guy like this.
sometimes you gotta shake the hell out of 'em.
you ready? - yeah.
page me with updates.
rough one? - Very.
me, too.
how's the baby, still kicking?
quiet now.
probably dead.
Oh, meredith, stop.
well, I'm just kidding.
mostly.
really, I need you to stop.
bad things happen, and it just makes me feel better to be prepared when they do.
but you don't know how things are gonna turn out.
right. exactly what I'm saying.
we own a hospital full of machines.
let's go find out everything we can.
he actually gave Dr. Bailey his pee.
anybody find out about this, I'm throwing you under the bus.
you're not scared of this guy.
no, I'm scared of Dr. Bailey.
Oh, oh think he's onto us?
that was pretty funny today.
the pranks, the drug test, the pages...
you guys, you really got me.
Yeah, well, the kid's got a little crush on, uh, wilson.
we were just having a little fun.
Oh, the kid does.
right.
well, you two kids have fun laughing about it later while I'm nailing Jo in the bathroom at the bar.
at first, idleness can seem like a welcome distraction
the troublemaking and the fun.
she is asleep.
Holymother of
could you, um, massage my leg again?
Yeah.
a little higher.
there?
Nope.
higher.
everyone needs some idle time to focus on something other than work...
even if it means focusing on something that's a little bit scary.
are you nervous?
no.
just take a look, and then we'll know.
is there a huge teratoma growing out of its head?
see for yourself.
look at you.
Avery's too young," I said.
he's too inexperienced," I said.
he has nobusiness running this hospital.
where you going with this, bailey?
I was wrong is where I'm going.
you all made a smart decision today.
I'm not gonna disappoint you.
thank you.
stepping back from work is the only way to get perspective.
what's all that?
Russell put me on the lotus valve trials.
I have to get through most of this tonight.
Ah, is he piling it on a little heavy?
Yes, he is.
Oh, are you gonna stay late and play with your new toys?
they're not toys.
but they are pretty fun.
I see the marble.
see? Ten fingers.
and it's only after we have everything in perspective...
that's not a finger.
Oh, it's a boy.
that we remember where our hands truly belong.
they hit you out of nowhere.
what happened?
we were arguing.
he kept saying that he couldn't trust me anymore, that I was a liar, that I... that I lied about how I was.
he hit you? - God, it just got so bad.
when bad things come, they come suddenly, without warning.
I don't know what's gonna happen now.
nothing's gonna happen.
you're safe.
all right? you're safe here.
you just need to get some sleep.
all right? just try and sleep.
if you need anything...
I'll have my cell.
where are you going?
we rarely get to see the catastrophe coming...
Alex, what are you gonna do?!
make sure that's covered, and make sure...
no matter how well we try to prepare for it.
what is all this?
weather report says a massive storm is coming.
hurricane force winds and heavy rain.
they say it's three days out.
so we have time to prepare, then.
exactly.
so for the e. r.we're gonna need to overstock supplies and blood products.
let's get ready for double capacity intakes.
that means extra beds and gurneys in the hallways.
this storm will bring in a lot of causalities.
we're gonna need to make room for them, so let's discharge all patients that can be.
post-op and long-term patients are gonna be transferred to seattle pres further inland.
we're gonna bring in supplementals-- water, food, meds, lighting.
uh, we're gonna be checking and refueling the backup generators.
as for you surgeons, push, postpone, or cancel all elective procedures until after this storm...
so we're canceling surgeries now?
well, you can afford to slow down a little bit.
I'm pregnant. I'm not sick.
you're very pregnant.
you're three weeks away from your due date.
shepherd. - yeah.
I need your help. come with me.
so you've got your craniofacial baby. are you gonna postpone?
no, he said elective.
the kid's got his brain on his face.
don't snap.
I was just wondering if maybe-- Well, we have three days.
most importantly, we're gonna need to print hard copies of all computerized patient charts in case of a power loss.
all of them?
do we have time to-- I'll do that.
Bailey, it's good to have you back.
I'll put you on the o. r. Rotation.
uh, I mean I'll do the charts.
folks, they're saying that this is going to be a bad one, but we have three days to prepare.
so let's do it and be ready when the storm hits.
thank you.
how's she doing?
she feels like she can't go into an o. r.
she thinks she'll kill anyone she touches.
I-I tried to convince her to come down to l. a. With me, take some time off, but then we heard about the storm, and she said she had to stay and help.
anything I can do?
I wish there was, but honestly... - anyone but me.
I know.
I brought him in a few hours ago.
he had a c. t. I wanted to wait for you.
you gotta help him.
it's chest peckwell.
I mean, jason myers.
so between removing the encephalocele and closing up the facial cleft...
it is gonna take most of the day.
you guys have any questions?
uh, n-no. I guess not. no.
I would tell you not to worry, but that's a load of crap.
you'll worry.
but if it helps, I'm not worried a bit.
it does help. a lot. Thank you.
so you knew exactly what to say to her.
is that a mom thing?
the internet told you I was a mom, too, huh?
Oh, god. okay, all right.
apparently, I'm super creepy 'cause I know everything about you.
well, I'm creepy, too, because the internet told me that you studied with bud clement, and I did a year under him at hopkins.
bud? I mean, he's a genius.
Yeah. - But oh, my god...
his breath. his breath is so bad.
something died in him. - It did.
all right. Well, this changes everything. I mean, if you studied under clement, then I'll have you do the calvarial graft and I'll just focus on the bipartion.
cool? - really?
Yay. Yeah, yay.
do you want to go get coffee before we start this?
um... Uh, y--uh, yeah.
you know, I have to get some stuff done.
so I will, um, I'll meet you-- I'll meet you up there.
okay. I mean, you're probably just gonna go cyber stalk me some more, huh?
I might be.
creepy.
I understand it.
if my dad doesn't wake up, I go live with strangers.
Hey, hey, hey, not strangers.
a foster family.
people who want to take care of you and are more...
more prepared to do that than your grandma is right now.
will they play soccer?
I hope so.
what if they don't?
what if they're like the people from "harry potter"?
like, gross, mean, and scary?
they-- they won't be, all right?
I promise.
but if my dad wakes up, I could stay with him, right?
Yeah, if he wakes up.
Ethan, honey. oh, eat your yogurt.
okay. Well, I'll see you, all right?
and don't worry. okay.
page me if anything changes.
Nancy and I had a conversation about withdrawal of care.
I did not bring it up.
she did.
she wanted to know what the chances are after nine days
it is way too so onto talk about pulling the plug.
and I told her since he's gone eight days without improvement, the neurological deficits are more likely permanent.
of course you did.
I wasn't gonna lie, owen.
she doesn't want to put her son through any more, or her
it's too soon.
get another head c. t.a c. b.c.and a chem panel.
we just drew blood this morning.
I know. Do it again.
can I ask you something?
when you and derek adopted zola, how did you know?
I mean, how did you really know that that was something you were gonna do?
Why?
are you thinking... - yeah, forget it.
just forget it.
clear the hallways for cots.
people will come looking for shelter.
how bad is this supposed to be? hope for the best, prepare for the worst, right?
what do we got?
39-year-oldconstruction worker.
wind blew him off a building.
fell four stories to impale himself on three bars of standing rebar.
vitals are stable.
minimal blood loss on the scene.
maintaing airway.
okay. Let's go.
let his name be bob.
please let his name be bob.
why?- shishka-bob.
my name's leon.
the patient's awake and responsive.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.
it's bad, huh?
this is really bad? am I gonna die?
the fact that we're talking right now, leon, means it's not as bad as it could be.
I guess so.
if these bars hadn't caught me, I'd be a stain on the pavement right now.
that's the attitude, leon. just keep that up, okay?
let's get him to the o. r. and we'll take x-rays there.
page grey and torres.
Kepner, kepner. - what?
I'll take this.
Why? Why? I caught it.
it's a big case, and I need you on-- yes, it is a big case.
it's my big case.
Hey, I-I am about to take my oral boards again, and this is exactly the kind of case that I want them to see that I can handle because I am going to crush them this year.
I need you on storm prep.
and you once told me that I should stop being an administrator and start being a surgeon.
and that's my human shish kebab.
okay. All right. I hear you. go.
thank you.
now I will check in on you.
if things get hairy, I'm tagging you out.
you won't have to!
what happened?
what does it look like?
brooks, what do you see?
like, someone super messed him up.
talk like a doctor.
um, temporal bone fracture with an epidural hemorrhage.
how soon does the bleed need to be evacuated?
like, yesterday.
Yeah, book an o. r. let's get him up there.
Karev, what the hell happened?
who did this?
make sure he doesn't die.
you can't let him die, okay?
this one's sitting right next to the carotid, but it doesn't seem to have damaged it.
this one's in the right upper quadrant.
and according to the ultrasound... it might have missed the liver.
the ultrasound on this one showed the femoral artery is intact, for now.
these bars are rough metal.
when we take them out, we risk shredding the vessels.
he could bleed out.
doctors, he's starting to lose his airway.
I need to intubate.
okay, I want to cut down the protruding bars as close as possible to minimize the damage when we pull them out.
bone cutter?
maybe.
uh, doubtful.
Nope. 1/2-inch rebar.
you're gonna want a 4-1/2-inch angle grinder with a cutoff wheel.
thank you, leon.
no worries.
okay, run.
do not walk.
chest peckwell?
Jo's chest peckwell?
Karev brought him in beat to hell.
he has a brain bleed.
Karev brought him in?
Yeah. I think that he's--Mnh-mnh.
do you have a 4-1/2-inch angle grinder with a cutoff wheel?
Dr. Bailey, I'm thrilled that you're back and honored that you requested me.
I'm very excited to be in your o. r. so what are we doing?
press "print, "go to the printer, take the chart, collate it, repeat.
we're doing this, then?
you need me to go over it again?
but bailey tested negative for staph.
and she knows that, but she doesn't feel it.
this way. This way.
where are you going with that?
O. r. One.
Kepner needs to cut the excess rebar off of shiska-bob
Leon. - All right.
come on.
where were we, uh... oh, yeah, bailey.
right. Uh, yeah, I just think that she needs to...
um, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah. yeah.
stop! Stop! Stop! - shut it off! shut it off!
you can't grind metal.
the room is full of oxygen.
the grinder's gonna give off sparks.
you'll blow up the room.
Oh, god. Okay. - yeah, good call.
I've, uh, been through something like this before.
and how'd that work out?
not great.
Oh, you're early.
so are you.
well, I kind of like to oversee the prep.
me, too.
feel free to join me,' cause clearly, you're a control freak.
well, nothing wrong with that since clearly, you're a bigger one.
it's exhausting, isn't it?
God, yes.
I'm surprised you're letting me do any of the reconstruction.
I figure, the more people know how to do this, the safer for kids everywhere.
it's kind of my way of controlling the world.
and this way, you have something to rember me by.
well, every time I tuck a baby's brain back into his skull, I will think
you are gonna think of me.
that's the idea.
here we go, right?
here we go.
the metal's laying on two major vessels.
they'll shred if we try and pull the entire bar through.
you're right. but I'm damned if I know how to do it, though.
can we take out the oxygen tanks?
well, the tanks, yes, but there are o-2 outputs in the floor, there and there.
I say we take him down to a patient room, do it there.
he's already under anesthesia, and he's too unstable to move.
all right, all right. how about this?
get all additional oxygen tanks out.
I manually hyperventilate him, get him on 100% o-2, and then I shut off the vent.
you cut.
when he runs out of air, you stop, I hyperventilate him again.
that'll take forever.
and it's still risky, but... it's our best shot.
all right. Just give me the grinder, and you can go.
all right, knox, you can go, too.
I got this. - this is dangerous work, people.
so everybody out.
I'll stay.
you'll need someone to hold the bar steady while you cut.
and you'll need me to irrigate the metal.
the grinder will heat up and could burn through the vessels.
that's... Very good thinking.
there may be liver damage.
no, grey, not you.
you go.
because I'm pregnant?
she has a kid.
she didn't bring hers to the o. r. With her today.
he's got a point, grey.
you should go.
Grey. go.
that's an order.
okay, let's gown up and wet down these drapes.
Hey, what's going on?
why am I being kicked out of my o. r?
Owen hunt just kicked me out of my o. r. for being pregnant.
he what?
well, there was a chance that it could explode, and it's--it is incredibly dangerous.
Oh, well, I'm on board with that, then.
check with karev.
he brought in a friend with a brain bleed.
guy was beaten half to death.
Jason myers from o. b.
it's not his friend.
these are today's scans?
with smaller cuts, like you asked.
wait.
what is that?
we have a problem.
Mer, check out this hyper density.
is that something or just noise on the film?
that looks real to me. it's alex.
get a c. t. Angio and find me.
I want to look at those vessels.
okay. all right. I'll hyperventilate him.
when we get to 100%, I'll say go, you cut.
we watch his sats drop to 90%.
below 90%, there could be tissue damage, even brain damage, so at 90%, I'll say stop and I'll pump him up again.
you ready?
ready.
and if anybody sees any sparks, then run like hell, understood?
Yeah.
okay. okay.
go.
Oh, my god. Sparks!
everybody okay? Everybody all right?
Torres? - fine. Yep. Let's do this.
okay, kepner, if you're someone who still prays, maybe
dear lord, please be with us right now. help us save this man, help us save leon.
in your name, we pray.
Amen. And... - Go.
let's move to the abdomen.
all right. Go.
Oh, sparks! sparks!
Oh, my--oh! ben, look!
Oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god!
no, we're good. We're good. we're good.
go. Go, go.
okay. oh, damn it. The c. s.f. Is leaking. This is worse than I thought.
the crack has torn the dura.
it's pretty grody.
grody"is not a thing we say.
list The possible complications.
um, death, that's pretty solid.
strokes, re-clots, being a potato, goofiness, loopiness, simpletonism.
difficulty with speech, memory, and vision.
why are you making me talk so much today?
because you're weird, and it bugs me.
but you also havea natural talent for this.
and the weirdness is there because you're covering up a real lack of confidence in your natural talent.
so now it is my job to make you feel confident and less weird.
okay?
whatever twists your knickers.
I said fight the guy.
I didn't mean fight the guy.
Alex, this kind of stuff was okay when we first met you, but now?
now you're supposed to be less stupid.
I mean, you could go to jail, your whole career
look, I'm not going to jail.
he was like that when I found him.
that's your story?
no cop is gonna believe you.
Alex, it's us.
just tell us.
I didn't do anything.
he didn't do it.
he just found him.
I did it.
Oh, god.
this is taking too long.
we've have to get into the abdomen.
almost there. Almost there.
go!
stop! No! No! No! can't turn it on! don't turn it on!
cover the body! Cover the body! fire!
88. He's getting hypoxic.
I got this.
okay, okay. Okay, go. - god, good catch, kepner.
okay, all the bars are cut.
let's see what we've got.
Torres, you go scrub.
Kepner, go back to the e. r. - what?
I need you prepping for the storm.
you need another surgeon for when we pull the rod out of his abdomen.
right, we're gonna be working on his neck so we have some time.
send in greyor whoever's available.
I've got it.
I'll find someone.
chief, he is my patient.
I have made every single right call since he came in here.
and what, you want me to stock shelves like some grocery clerk?
I need you there more than I need you here.
Kepner, I'm notgonna ask you again.
go now!
nice.
I'm gonna mark where i'm making my cuts, arizona.
then you will mark a 2x3-centimenter piece of the parietal for the graft.
Dr. Avery, DR. Robbins is gonna do the calvarial graft, and then I thought I would walk you through the reconstruction of the nose and the lip.
Oh, I'm fine to watch the master at work today.
come on, boswell.
it sounds like you're trying to get us to do all the work.
sounds to me like avery is chicken.
not what I said.
you came out all this way.
well, he can run a hospital, but he's still a baby surgeon.
you're one of the grey sloan seven?
is that a thing?
Yes, that's a thing.
you guys are legend.
you bought the hospital, saved the staff.
well, you know us control freaks.
we try to run everything.
it was brave.
I couldn't have done it.
and I'm so impressed.
and you, sir, are doing this reconstruction, okay?
okay. - Okay.
Arizona, are you ready to mark your graft?
Yeah. yeah, let me in.
all right. Come right over here next to me.
here, go through these again and just make sure they're in order.
Dr. Bailey, is there a reason you chose me to do this?
because you're an intern.
a surgical intern, at a hospital, not a kinko's.
just... since DR. Shepherd kicked me off his service,
I worry that everyone thinks I'm a losing bet.
and if that's what people think
do you want to be responsible for killing a patient, ross?
if the power goes out and we lose access toa patient's electronic files and we reach for her chart in this pile and it's not there, what will happen?
well, that's pretty hypothetical
the patient would die, ross, and it would be your fault.
and how would you feel?
I-- How would you feel?
uh, bailey. Hunt needs another hand in the o. r. Asked for you to scrub in.
uh, tell him I can't. storm's coming.
this needs to get done. - Bailey.
I'm in the middle of the backup charts.
if I stop, i'll lose the order.
he needs to get someone else.
I'll go.
I'll do it myself.
of course you will.
we were having a fight.
he--he grabbed my arm.
I fought him off. It just--it got ugly.
he fell backwards and he hit his head on the fireplace, but he was still yelling when I left.
he was fine. I swear.
all right, you gotta go. Go.
uh, no, she has to explain to them what happened.
no, nobody does anything until we see how peckwell is.
look, go home.
don't let anyone see you.
you two don't say a word to anybody until we know exactly what's going on.
understand?
are you okay? - she's okay.
you never saw her.
what?
I have paul dawson'sc. t.Angio results. - great.
go.
don't do anything stupid.
Oh, is that chest peckwell?
h-how is he?
Oh, a bad bleed.
we won't know more until he wakes.
what the hell happened?
I don't know.
um, I need your help.
people keep saying that to me today.
I found that on paul dawson's scan.
could that be a clot that we missed?
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
it's blocking blood flow to the basilar artery.
Brooks... why would we miss that?
Oh, I'm not asking her.
Yeah, she's-- she's asking you.
and I'm asking you.
because it's a thrombus... which is harder to see.
it's more common to find a bleed or an infarct.
you were looking for the wrong thing.
nice job.
could you take it out, like now?
run a pipeline stent and restore the blood flow to the basilar?
I mean, could that wake him up?
it could.
it could also kill him.
does the family want to take that risk?
but, um, you--you said that yesterday.
you said it--It was our last chance.
this is... a long shot.
well, what does DR. Hunt say?
Dr. Hunt is in surgery, and paul is my patient.
and it's your decision.
Nancy, every second counts now.
well, if there's a chance that... - okay. Okay.
what are you doing?
sorry.
it's pac-man.
because it looks like pac-man.
now what do we need to watch out for?
dislodging the clot.
jamming the stent, or
Oh, damn it.
the basilar wall is dissecting.
it's just too weak.
if you don't place the stent, it could rupture, right?
Yeah. If we place it too fast-- you risk ripping the artery in half.
either way, he's--He's dead.
good. - Yeah. just be quiet.
I'm going, I swear.
I just had to grab some clothes.
look... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt jason.
I was just trying to get away from him.
and I lost it. I just lost it.
I like you.
but I love alex.
I don't know if he's dumb enough or loyal enough to take the fall for you, but he just might be.
I'd never let him do that.
I wouldn't.
okay.
are they done with that in the o. r?
Yeah, they were done a while ago.
then why aren't I back up there?
uh, I-I don't know.
okay. okay. okay.
dissecting is stopped.
stent is in place.
good. any leaks?
I'm... Not sure.
yes or no, brooks.
confidence.
no, sir. No leaks.
good.
Dr. Shepherd, you have a message.
Yeah, not now.
it's from DR. Grey.
she took a fall on the stairs.
she says she's okay, but she's going to o. b.to get checked.
I can finish. You should go.
no, you can't. - You're done. Hard part's over.
I'll just, uh, retract the sheath, hold pressure on the femoral arteriotomy, done.
I can do it. Go.
okay. here.
what?
Oh, no! Oh, no. no, mousey. mousey, no. no, don't touch her.
mousey, no!
Bailey just said no?
might be 'cause it was me who asked her.
no, I'm telling you, she's just a little shaken up.
she needs a break.
you know, christina went through something similar, so I get it.
how about you pull out the bar, and I'll jump in and catch the bleeders?
got it.
Torres, a hand here. Hmm?
Yep. - okay.
you know it was the same with arizona.
you can't rush her back to work.
mm, that might be true... for them.
forgive me, ben, but with someone like bailey
sometimes you just need to rip off the band-aid.
here we go.
okay. Let's go. - Yeah. Gotcha.
that is a handsome face.
mm, very handsome.
I couldn't have done it any better myself.
well, I wouldn't have done it at all.
thank you.
this was incredible.
Oh, it was my pleasure.
now my downfall as a surgeon is a very tiny bladder, so you guys have this.
I'll see you in just a second.
she is just one of those people, isn't she?
what? What do you mean?
one of those people that just make you feel like you're capable of anything.
Sloan was like that.
he just sort of took for granted that you were great...
so that you'd be great.
I wish she could stick around a little longer.
I just--I have not felt like this in a long time.
Yeah.
the baby's fine. - define "fine.
and feel free to talk like a doctor.
fine means zero signoff placental abruption or any injury to the fetus.
no bleeding, no uterine rupture.
his heart beat's great.
no distress.
everything is where it should be.
you are incredibly lucky.
are you in any pain?
no. Uh, just--just sore.
if you start to feel any pain at all, you know where I am.
thank you, connie.
see, I told you, you need to slow down.
you know how we could have avoided this?
if I'd been safely in that exploding o. r.where I should have been.
put your pants on.
I just closed a midline facial cleft.
primary surgeon.
what is wrong?
I don't know.
hunt is actively keeping me from surgeries.
I don't know if he thinks that I'm gonna fail my boards again, or maybe he's just finally realized that I'd make a better secretary than a surgeon.
so I'll talk to him.
no. don't. Don't. I don't--I don't want you to fight for me.
Dr. Kepner, trauma's coming in.
great.
something else I can get kicked off of.
did they run a c. b.c. and a k. b. Stain?
Yes, they ran all the tests. the baby is fine.
Yeah, well, what about you? I mean, why did you fall? are you dizzy?
I fell because I have the same center of gravity as a jersey cow.
I'm fine, guys.
doctors, it's time.
it's happening.
come on. come on. - Hurry. before it starts.
a 48-year-old male complaining of tightness in his chest.
he says he feels like his heart is gonna burst.
all right, sir, we're gonna take care of you, okay?
is he seizing?
was there a head injury involved?
uh, what is that music?
um, sir, no.
um, you probably don't wannaget off of that if you don't
what are you doing?
what is-- what are you doing?
what are you... what are you doing?
wait? What?
what is going on?
I'm...
Oh, my god!
they're everywhere.
Oh, god!
it's so high!
who'd have thought kepner would've found somebody as dorky as she is?
he is like the male kepner.
what are the odds?
all right, april! - oh, my god.
uh, april, I know that this seems crazy... - this is totally crazy.
what?
and to some, sudden.
but when I know something, I know it.
when I first saw you standing in this doorway... I felt a shock.
and, uh, and I thought... this is the most beautiful person that I've ever seen.
and then I thought... Yeah, well, no, I-I knew...
that I was gonna fall in love with you.
Oh, god.
and I have never been so happy knowing anything in my entire life.
Oh, my... oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life trying to make you as happy as you make me...
Oh, my god.
if you'll let me.
will you marry me?
Yes. Yes it was beautiful!
way to go, matthew!
many happy years!
all right, matthew!
how does kepner get that?
how does that happen?
and I get crazy, I get cancer, and now I gota psychopathic maniac.
screw it. I give up. I'm walking away.
Alex, what were you gonna do if you got to peckwell's house first?
were you gonna have coffee and talk it out?
I mean, tell me he wouldn't have been worse off had you gotten there first.
people change, but they don't change.
maybe jo's crazy fits your crazy.
don't give up on her just yet.
we didn't give up on you.
chest peckwell is awake.
how is he?
he's fine.
but he's--he's asking for the police.
I thought this storm was coming in three days.
you know weather guys.
they're wrong most of the time, and they still keep their jobs.
how do you feel, honestly?
honestly?
I'd feel better if the wall hadn't dissected.
I'm afraid it's done more harm than good.
how did I miss this clot?
you didn't, or it'd still be in there.
you've done everything you can.
then why isn't he awake?
he looks beautiful.
Yeah, and when he's 6 feet tall and has a full head of hair, all of this is gonna recede to just a tiny, little scar on his forehead.
the girls are gonna love it. it'll give him some mystery.
thank you... So much.
amazing.
this was an amazing day.
well, you guys did most of the work.
I'm happy I just got to watch.
Yeah, well, is there anything else that I can...
you can show meto an on-call room.
uh... W-why?
first night post-op, I like to stay close by in case anything happens.
Oh, wow, you poor, poor control freak.
Oh, you really get me.
Yeah. I really do.
this way.
cops here yet?
let's talk for a second.
she attacked me, all right? jo's a lunatic. She's disturbed, and she's a liar.
listen... you got a good thing here.
good job.
nice place.
you have friends here?
Oh, you want to bemy friend now?
me?
Nah.
I got enough friends.
Cristina yang-- she's my friend.
she owns the hospital.
owns the hospital.
Meredith grey--her name's on the friggin' door.
and these are my friends.
and they don't like a guy who hits his girlfriend.
neither do i.
she attacked me.
what was I supposed to do?
you're supposed to take it.
a girl hits you, you take it, or you walk away.
it's the story of my life.
Jason, you can tell this story till you're blue in the face, but all people are gonna hear is that you hit her.
and that little bit-- it's gonna follow you around the halls here.
and if you leave, it'll get wherever you're going before you do.
Oh, you'll make sure of that, huh?
it sounds like you're blackmailing me.
it sounds like you're a guy who hits girls,' cause you did.
so what do you want to do next?
What'd he say?
what, you heard that?
I did.
you think it's okay to blackmail people, karev?
I wasn't.
it was just a threat.
you're threatening him?
what are you thinking?
a bunch of people got hurt here.
I didn't see the point in any more.
I mean, the guy's not pressing charges.
Oh, so it all works out.
you feel good about that?
because you shouldn't.
Bailey, when the chief of surgery orders you to scrub in on a surgery, you scrub in on that surgery.
the last I heard, you'renotchief of surgery or my boss.
but I am part owner of this hospital, which does, in fact, make me your boss.
and you're not a file clerk.
we have enough file clerks.
but we need a surgeons.
so eitherbea surgeon, or get the hell out.
cause we don't need you.
he looks great.
he is.
broken leg, minor internal injuries.
after all that, it turned out to be kind of a nothing case.
you had absolutely no right to kick me out of that o. r. Today.
Grey, you weren't necessary that
you did it because I'm pregnant and because you were trying to protect me.
Yes. And?
I just want you to know it's completely unacceptable.
and thank you.
noted.
you asked me about zola today.
we just knew.
you know, derek knew first, of course, because he's derek, and it took me a little longer because I-I was... Scared.
one day, I just picked her up, and...
I just knew.
I don't know how else to explain it.
I looked at her, and she was my daughter.
I just knew.
you know, this kid-- he needs someone, and I like him, and, uh, and he likes me.
he's scared and alone and... And... I could help.
I know how to help, and I want to.
and then I talk myself out of it because he's not my kid.
he's 10.
it's... It's a huge commitment.
it's a lifetime of responsibility.
and it pretty much uproots everything.
but then I spend one minute with this kid, and... I can't imagine not doing it.
you're thinking I'm crazy.
no. I'm thinking that's exactly the way I felt.
Cristina won't get it.
it's paul.
you should come.
he's awake. he's fine. Uh, neuro's good, he's talking.
he's fine.
get him set for transfer to seattle pres.
well, isn't that a little-- I want them out of here a. s.a. p.
the storm's here sooner than predicted, and I want them moved inland before it gets worse.
I've rounded on your entire service.
brooks, thanks.
you've stepped up when I needed it today.
I'm proud of you.
thank you, sir.
give it up.
stay weird, brooks.
with me, ross.
God, there's more?
never saw it coming, right?
what's that, the storm?
no. April. I was sure someone would let it slip.
and have you, uh, seen DR. Hunt?
no, no. What's up? nothing.
I--i'd... Would you tell him thanks, though?
I had him keep april out of surgeries all day.
this was kind of my only shot at this.
didn't wanna miss it.
no, no, you didn't.
congratulations, both of you guys. - Thanks.
still awake?
Yes, ma'am.
owen's, uh, transferring paul dawson and his kid over to seattle pres.
how's owen? - I don't know.
you know, I woke the guy up.
that's all he's been wanting to do, but now he just seems more disappointed with me, and I know he's got close to the kid.
you know, owen was talking about taking the kid himself.
taking him?
what, like a-adopting him?
or fostering.
he asked me about it. He seemed ready to do it.
okay, what am I supposed to do with that?
like, what am I supposed to do?
I don't think there's anything you can do.
I don't think it's about you.
thank you.
you guys have backup generators, right?
Yeah, of course we do.
this really has been a lot of fun.
sort of sorry-- me, too.
I'm sorry it's over.
Yeah.
all right, well, then you'll just have to have me back at some point.
that would be really great.
okay.
Oh, god!
I can't. - what?
I can't.
we do our very best.
it was a pleasure meeting you.
you are allowed to lose a little bit of control.
but sometimes it's just not good enough.
we buckle our seat belts.
we wear a helmet.
we stick to the lighted paths.
what the hell happened?
the power went out a half-hour-- no, you.
what were you thinking?
peckwell could have died.
is he
no, he's fine, and you're lucky he's not pressing charges, but you are an idiot.
you get that you could have gone to jail, right?
you say that you worked so hard to change, to become this new person, but then you do this?
if you don't wanna be a lowlife anymore, you gotta grow upand stop acting like one.
no, you grow up!
not everyone's like you, alex.
people are horrible.
and the last time someone grabbed me like jason did, I...
I promised no one would ever do that again.
so I am sorry, but... not everyone's like you.
not everyone's good.
we try to be safe.
and now you think I'm horrible, too.
no.
no. If you hadn't gotten to him first, I probably would have killed the guy.
Why? why would you do that for me?
shut up.
why wouldn't i?
we try so hard to protect ourselves, but it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.
cause when the bad things come, they come out of nowhere.
the storm is here.
it's totally here.
the, uh, day care center said they're gonna be open for 24 hours, so I'm keeping sofia in there.
we're not leaving. are you guys leaving?
I don't know.
where the hell is arizona?
we're gonna stay, right?
Yes, we're gonna stay.
cause if we get trapped at the house, and you go into labor...
no, we're staying because they need surgeons.
you need to take it easy.
I'm just gonna work until I
the bad things come suddenly with no warning.
what? meredith, what is it?
but we forget... - you okay?
Yeah.
that sometimes...
Yeah. My water just broke.
what?
okay. - Okay.
okay.
that's how the good things come, too.
okay.
what happened?
we were arguing.
he kept saying that he couldn't trust me anymore, that I was a liar, that I... that I lied about how I was.
he hit you? - God, it just got so bad.
when bad things come, they come suddenly, without warning.
I don't know what's gonna happen now.
nothing's gonna happen.
you're safe.
all right? you're safe here.
you just need to get some sleep.
all right? just try and sleep.
if you need anything...
I'll have my cell.
where are you going?
we rarely get to see the catastrophe coming...
Alex, what are you gonna do?!
make sure that's covered, and make sure...
no matter how well we try to prepare for it.
what is all this?
weather report says a massive storm is coming.
hurricane force winds and heavy rain.
they say it's three days out.
so we have time to prepare, then.
exactly.
so for the e. r.we're gonna need to overstock supplies and blood products.
let's get ready for double capacity intakes.
that means extra beds and gurneys in the hallways.
this storm will bring in a lot of causalities.
we're gonna need to make room for them, so let's discharge all patients that can be.
post-op and long-term patients are gonna be transferred to seattle pres further inland.
we're gonna bring in supplementals-- water, food, meds, lighting.
uh, we're gonna be checking and refueling the backup generators.
as for you surgeons, push, postpone, or cancel all elective procedures until after this storm...
so we're canceling surgeries now?
well, you can afford to slow down a little bit.
I'm pregnant. I'm not sick.
you're very pregnant.
you're three weeks away from your due date.
shepherd. - yeah.
I need your help. come with me.
so you've got your craniofacial baby. are you gonna postpone?
no, he said elective.
the kid's got his brain on his face.
don't snap.
I was just wondering if maybe-- Well, we have three days.
most importantly, we're gonna need to print hard copies of all computerized patient charts in case of a power loss.
all of them?
do we have time to-- I'll do that.
Bailey, it's good to have you back.
I'll put you on the o. r. Rotation.
uh, I mean I'll do the charts.
folks, they're saying that this is going to be a bad one, but we have three days to prepare.
so let's do it and be ready when the storm hits.
thank you.
how's she doing?
she feels like she can't go into an o. r.
she thinks she'll kill anyone she touches.
I-I tried to convince her to come down to l. a. With me, take some time off, but then we heard about the storm, and she said she had to stay and help.
anything I can do?
I wish there was, but honestly... - anyone but me.
I know.
I brought him in a few hours ago.
he had a c. t. I wanted to wait for you.
you gotta help him.
it's chest peckwell.
I mean, jason myers.
so between removing the encephalocele and closing up the facial cleft...
it is gonna take most of the day.
you guys have any questions?
uh, n-no. I guess not. no.
I would tell you not to worry, but that's a load of crap.
you'll worry.
but if it helps, I'm not worried a bit.
it does help. a lot. Thank you.
so you knew exactly what to say to her.
is that a mom thing?
the internet told you I was a mom, too, huh?
Oh, god. okay, all right.
apparently, I'm super creepy 'cause I know everything about you.
well, I'm creepy, too, because the internet told me that you studied with bud clement, and I did a year under him at hopkins.
bud? I mean, he's a genius.
Yeah. - But oh, my god...
his breath. his breath is so bad.
something died in him. - It did.
all right. Well, this changes everything. I mean, if you studied under clement, then I'll have you do the calvarial graft and I'll just focus on the bipartion.
cool? - really?
Yay. Yeah, yay.
do you want to go get coffee before we start this?
um... Uh, y--uh, yeah.
you know, I have to get some stuff done.
so I will, um, I'll meet you-- I'll meet you up there.
okay. I mean, you're probably just gonna go cyber stalk me some more, huh?
I might be.
creepy.
I understand it.
if my dad doesn't wake up, I go live with strangers.
Hey, hey, hey, not strangers.
a foster family.
people who want to take care of you and are more...
more prepared to do that than your grandma is right now.
will they play soccer?
I hope so.
what if they don't?
what if they're like the people from "harry potter"?
like, gross, mean, and scary?
they-- they won't be, all right?
I promise.
but if my dad wakes up, I could stay with him, right?
Yeah, if he wakes up.
Ethan, honey. oh, eat your yogurt.
okay. Well, I'll see you, all right?
and don't worry. okay.
page me if anything changes.
Nancy and I had a conversation about withdrawal of care.
I did not bring it up.
she did.
she wanted to know what the chances are after nine days
it is way too so onto talk about pulling the plug.
and I told her since he's gone eight days without improvement, the neurological deficits are more likely permanent.
of course you did.
I wasn't gonna lie, owen.
she doesn't want to put her son through any more, or her
it's too soon.
get another head c. t.a c. b.c.and a chem panel.
we just drew blood this morning.
I know. Do it again.
can I ask you something?
when you and derek adopted zola, how did you know?
I mean, how did you really know that that was something you were gonna do?
Why?
are you thinking... - yeah, forget it.
just forget it.
clear the hallways for cots.
people will come looking for shelter.
how bad is this supposed to be? hope for the best, prepare for the worst, right?
what do we got?
39-year-oldconstruction worker.
wind blew him off a building.
fell four stories to impale himself on three bars of standing rebar.
vitals are stable.
minimal blood loss on the scene.
maintaing airway.
okay. Let's go.
let his name be bob.
please let his name be bob.
why?- shishka-bob.
my name's leon.
the patient's awake and responsive.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.
it's bad, huh?
this is really bad? am I gonna die?
the fact that we're talking right now, leon, means it's not as bad as it could be.
I guess so.
if these bars hadn't caught me, I'd be a stain on the pavement right now.
that's the attitude, leon. just keep that up, okay?
let's get him to the o. r. and we'll take x-rays there.
page grey and torres.
Kepner, kepner. - what?
I'll take this.
Why? Why? I caught it.
it's a big case, and I need you on-- yes, it is a big case.
it's my big case.
Hey, I-I am about to take my oral boards again, and this is exactly the kind of case that I want them to see that I can handle because I am going to crush them this year.
I need you on storm prep.
and you once told me that I should stop being an administrator and start being a surgeon.
and that's my human shish kebab.
okay. All right. I hear you. go.
thank you.
now I will check in on you.
if things get hairy, I'm tagging you out.
you won't have to!
what happened?
what does it look like?
brooks, what do you see?
like, someone super messed him up.
talk like a doctor.
um, temporal bone fracture with an epidural hemorrhage.
how soon does the bleed need to be evacuated?
like, yesterday.
Yeah, book an o. r. let's get him up there.
Karev, what the hell happened?
who did this?
make sure he doesn't die.
you can't let him die, okay?
this one's sitting right next to the carotid, but it doesn't seem to have damaged it.
this one's in the right upper quadrant.
and according to the ultrasound... it might have missed the liver.
the ultrasound on this one showed the femoral artery is intact, for now.
these bars are rough metal.
when we take them out, we risk shredding the vessels.
he could bleed out.
doctors, he's starting to lose his airway.
I need to intubate.
okay, I want to cut down the protruding bars as close as possible to minimize the damage when we pull them out.
bone cutter?
maybe.
uh, doubtful.
Nope. 1/2-inch rebar.
you're gonna want a 4-1/2-inch angle grinder with a cutoff wheel.
thank you, leon.
no worries.
okay, run.
do not walk.
chest peckwell?
Jo's chest peckwell?
Karev brought him in beat to hell.
he has a brain bleed.
Karev brought him in?
Yeah. I think that he's--Mnh-mnh.
do you have a 4-1/2-inch angle grinder with a cutoff wheel?
Dr. Bailey, I'm thrilled that you're back and honored that you requested me.
I'm very excited to be in your o. r. so what are we doing?
press "print, "go to the printer, take the chart, collate it, repeat.
we're doing this, then?
you need me to go over it again?
but bailey tested negative for staph.
and she knows that, but she doesn't feel it.
this way. This way.
where are you going with that?
O. r. One.
Kepner needs to cut the excess rebar off of shiska-bob
Leon. - All right.
come on.
where were we, uh... oh, yeah, bailey.
right. Uh, yeah, I just think that she needs to...
um, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah. yeah.
stop! Stop! Stop! - shut it off! shut it off!
you can't grind metal.
the room is full of oxygen.
the grinder's gonna give off sparks.
you'll blow up the room.
Oh, god. Okay. - yeah, good call.
I've, uh, been through something like this before.
and how'd that work out?
not great.
Oh, you're early.
so are you.
well, I kind of like to oversee the prep.
me, too.
feel free to join me,' cause clearly, you're a control freak.
well, nothing wrong with that since clearly, you're a bigger one.
it's exhausting, isn't it?
God, yes.
I'm surprised you're letting me do any of the reconstruction.
I figure, the more people know how to do this, the safer for kids everywhere.
it's kind of my way of controlling the world.
and this way, you have something to rember me by.
well, every time I tuck a baby's brain back into his skull, I will think
you are gonna think of me.
that's the idea.
here we go, right?
here we go.
the metal's laying on two major vessels.
they'll shred if we try and pull the entire bar through.
you're right. but I'm damned if I know how to do it, though.
can we take out the oxygen tanks?
well, the tanks, yes, but there are o-2 outputs in the floor, there and there.
I say we take him down to a patient room, do it there.
he's already under anesthesia, and he's too unstable to move.
all right, all right. how about this?
get all additional oxygen tanks out.
I manually hyperventilate him, get him on 100% o-2, and then I shut off the vent.
you cut.
when he runs out of air, you stop, I hyperventilate him again.
that'll take forever.
and it's still risky, but... it's our best shot.
all right. Just give me the grinder, and you can go.
all right, knox, you can go, too.
I got this. - this is dangerous work, people.
so everybody out.
I'll stay.
you'll need someone to hold the bar steady while you cut.
and you'll need me to irrigate the metal.
the grinder will heat up and could burn through the vessels.
that's... Very good thinking.
there may be liver damage.
no, grey, not you.
you go.
because I'm pregnant?
she has a kid.
she didn't bring hers to the o. r. With her today.
he's got a point, grey.
you should go.
Grey. go.
that's an order.
okay, let's gown up and wet down these drapes.
Hey, what's going on?
why am I being kicked out of my o. r?
Owen hunt just kicked me out of my o. r. for being pregnant.
he what?
well, there was a chance that it could explode, and it's--it is incredibly dangerous.
Oh, well, I'm on board with that, then.
check with karev.
he brought in a friend with a brain bleed.
guy was beaten half to death.
Jason myers from o. b.
it's not his friend.
these are today's scans?
with smaller cuts, like you asked.
wait.
what is that?
we have a problem.
Mer, check out this hyper density.
is that something or just noise on the film?
that looks real to me. it's alex.
get a c. t. Angio and find me.
I want to look at those vessels.
okay. all right. I'll hyperventilate him.
when we get to 100%, I'll say go, you cut.
we watch his sats drop to 90%.
below 90%, there could be tissue damage, even brain damage, so at 90%, I'll say stop and I'll pump him up again.
you ready?
ready.
and if anybody sees any sparks, then run like hell, understood?
Yeah.
okay. okay.
go.
Oh, my god. Sparks!
everybody okay? Everybody all right?
Torres? - fine. Yep. Let's do this.
okay, kepner, if you're someone who still prays, maybe
dear lord, please be with us right now. help us save this man, help us save leon.
in your name, we pray.
Amen. And... - Go.
let's move to the abdomen.
all right. Go.
Oh, sparks! sparks!
Oh, my--oh! ben, look!
Oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god!
no, we're good. We're good. we're good.
go. Go, go.
okay. oh, damn it. The c. s.f. Is leaking. This is worse than I thought.
the crack has torn the dura.
it's pretty grody.
grody"is not a thing we say.
list The possible complications.
um, death, that's pretty solid.
strokes, re-clots, being a potato, goofiness, loopiness, simpletonism.
difficulty with speech, memory, and vision.
why are you making me talk so much today?
because you're weird, and it bugs me.
but you also havea natural talent for this.
and the weirdness is there because you're covering up a real lack of confidence in your natural talent.
so now it is my job to make you feel confident and less weird.
okay?
whatever twists your knickers.
I said fight the guy.
I didn't mean fight the guy.
Alex, this kind of stuff was okay when we first met you, but now?
now you're supposed to be less stupid.
I mean, you could go to jail, your whole career
look, I'm not going to jail.
he was like that when I found him.
that's your story?
no cop is gonna believe you.
Alex, it's us.
just tell us.
I didn't do anything.
he didn't do it.
he just found him.
I did it.
Oh, god.
this is taking too long.
we've have to get into the abdomen.
almost there. Almost there.
go!
stop! No! No! No! can't turn it on! don't turn it on!
cover the body! Cover the body! fire!
88. He's getting hypoxic.
I got this.
okay, okay. Okay, go. - god, good catch, kepner.
okay, all the bars are cut.
let's see what we've got.
Torres, you go scrub.
Kepner, go back to the e. r. - what?
I need you prepping for the storm.
you need another surgeon for when we pull the rod out of his abdomen.
right, we're gonna be working on his neck so we have some time.
send in greyor whoever's available.
I've got it.
I'll find someone.
chief, he is my patient.
I have made every single right call since he came in here.
and what, you want me to stock shelves like some grocery clerk?
I need you there more than I need you here.
Kepner, I'm notgonna ask you again.
go now!
nice.
I'm gonna mark where i'm making my cuts, arizona.
then you will mark a 2x3-centimenter piece of the parietal for the graft.
Dr. Avery, DR. Robbins is gonna do the calvarial graft, and then I thought I would walk you through the reconstruction of the nose and the lip.
Oh, I'm fine to watch the master at work today.
come on, boswell.
it sounds like you're trying to get us to do all the work.
sounds to me like avery is chicken.
not what I said.
you came out all this way.
well, he can run a hospital, but he's still a baby surgeon.
you're one of the grey sloan seven?
is that a thing?
Yes, that's a thing.
you guys are legend.
you bought the hospital, saved the staff.
well, you know us control freaks.
we try to run everything.
it was brave.
I couldn't have done it.
and I'm so impressed.
and you, sir, are doing this reconstruction, okay?
okay. - Okay.
Arizona, are you ready to mark your graft?
Yeah. yeah, let me in.
all right. Come right over here next to me.
here, go through these again and just make sure they're in order.
Dr. Bailey, is there a reason you chose me to do this?
because you're an intern.
a surgical intern, at a hospital, not a kinko's.
just... since DR. Shepherd kicked me off his service,
I worry that everyone thinks I'm a losing bet.
and if that's what people think
do you want to be responsible for killing a patient, ross?
if the power goes out and we lose access toa patient's electronic files and we reach for her chart in this pile and it's not there, what will happen?
well, that's pretty hypothetical
the patient would die, ross, and it would be your fault.
and how would you feel?
I-- How would you feel?
uh, bailey. Hunt needs another hand in the o. r. Asked for you to scrub in.
uh, tell him I can't. storm's coming.
this needs to get done. - Bailey.
I'm in the middle of the backup charts.
if I stop, i'll lose the order.
he needs to get someone else.
I'll go.
I'll do it myself.
of course you will.
we were having a fight.
he--he grabbed my arm.
I fought him off. It just--it got ugly.
he fell backwards and he hit his head on the fireplace, but he was still yelling when I left.
he was fine. I swear.
all right, you gotta go. Go.
uh, no, she has to explain to them what happened.
no, nobody does anything until we see how peckwell is.
look, go home.
don't let anyone see you.
you two don't say a word to anybody until we know exactly what's going on.
understand?
are you okay? - she's okay.
you never saw her.
what?
I have paul dawson'sc. t.Angio results. - great.
go.
don't do anything stupid.
Oh, is that chest peckwell?
h-how is he?
Oh, a bad bleed.
we won't know more until he wakes.
what the hell happened?
I don't know.
um, I need your help.
people keep saying that to me today.
I found that on paul dawson's scan.
could that be a clot that we missed?
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
it's blocking blood flow to the basilar artery.
Brooks... why would we miss that?
Oh, I'm not asking her.
Yeah, she's-- she's asking you.
and I'm asking you.
because it's a thrombus... which is harder to see.
it's more common to find a bleed or an infarct.
you were looking for the wrong thing.
nice job.
could you take it out, like now?
run a pipeline stent and restore the blood flow to the basilar?
I mean, could that wake him up?
it could.
it could also kill him.
does the family want to take that risk?
but, um, you--you said that yesterday.
you said it--It was our last chance.
this is... a long shot.
well, what does DR. Hunt say?
Dr. Hunt is in surgery, and paul is my patient.
and it's your decision.
Nancy, every second counts now.
well, if there's a chance that... - okay. Okay.
what are you doing?
sorry.
it's pac-man.
because it looks like pac-man.
now what do we need to watch out for?
dislodging the clot.
jamming the stent, or
Oh, damn it.
the basilar wall is dissecting.
it's just too weak.
if you don't place the stent, it could rupture, right?
Yeah. If we place it too fast-- you risk ripping the artery in half.
either way, he's--He's dead.
good. - Yeah. just be quiet.
I'm going, I swear.
I just had to grab some clothes.
look... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt jason.
I was just trying to get away from him.
and I lost it. I just lost it.
I like you.
but I love alex.
I don't know if he's dumb enough or loyal enough to take the fall for you, but he just might be.
I'd never let him do that.
I wouldn't.
okay.
are they done with that in the o. r?
Yeah, they were done a while ago.
then why aren't I back up there?
uh, I-I don't know.
okay. okay. okay.
dissecting is stopped.
stent is in place.
good. any leaks?
I'm... Not sure.
yes or no, brooks.
confidence.
no, sir. No leaks.
good.
Dr. Shepherd, you have a message.
Yeah, not now.
it's from DR. Grey.
she took a fall on the stairs.
she says she's okay, but she's going to o. b.to get checked.
I can finish. You should go.
no, you can't. - You're done. Hard part's over.
I'll just, uh, retract the sheath, hold pressure on the femoral arteriotomy, done.
I can do it. Go.
okay. here.
what?
Oh, no! Oh, no. no, mousey. mousey, no. no, don't touch her.
mousey, no!
Bailey just said no?
might be 'cause it was me who asked her.
no, I'm telling you, she's just a little shaken up.
she needs a break.
you know, christina went through something similar, so I get it.
how about you pull out the bar, and I'll jump in and catch the bleeders?
got it.
Torres, a hand here. Hmm?
Yep. - okay.
you know it was the same with arizona.
you can't rush her back to work.
mm, that might be true... for them.
forgive me, ben, but with someone like bailey
sometimes you just need to rip off the band-aid.
here we go.
okay. Let's go. - Yeah. Gotcha.
that is a handsome face.
mm, very handsome.
I couldn't have done it any better myself.
well, I wouldn't have done it at all.
thank you.
this was incredible.
Oh, it was my pleasure.
now my downfall as a surgeon is a very tiny bladder, so you guys have this.
I'll see you in just a second.
she is just one of those people, isn't she?
what? What do you mean?
one of those people that just make you feel like you're capable of anything.
Sloan was like that.
he just sort of took for granted that you were great...
so that you'd be great.
I wish she could stick around a little longer.
I just--I have not felt like this in a long time.
Yeah.
the baby's fine. - define "fine.
and feel free to talk like a doctor.
fine means zero signoff placental abruption or any injury to the fetus.
no bleeding, no uterine rupture.
his heart beat's great.
no distress.
everything is where it should be.
you are incredibly lucky.
are you in any pain?
no. Uh, just--just sore.
if you start to feel any pain at all, you know where I am.
thank you, connie.
see, I told you, you need to slow down.
you know how we could have avoided this?
if I'd been safely in that exploding o. r.where I should have been.
put your pants on.
I just closed a midline facial cleft.
primary surgeon.
what is wrong?
I don't know.
hunt is actively keeping me from surgeries.
I don't know if he thinks that I'm gonna fail my boards again, or maybe he's just finally realized that I'd make a better secretary than a surgeon.
so I'll talk to him.
no. don't. Don't. I don't--I don't want you to fight for me.
Dr. Kepner, trauma's coming in.
great.
something else I can get kicked off of.
did they run a c. b.c. and a k. b. Stain?
Yes, they ran all the tests. the baby is fine.
Yeah, well, what about you? I mean, why did you fall? are you dizzy?
I fell because I have the same center of gravity as a jersey cow.
I'm fine, guys.
doctors, it's time.
it's happening.
come on. come on. - Hurry. before it starts.
a 48-year-old male complaining of tightness in his chest.
he says he feels like his heart is gonna burst.
all right, sir, we're gonna take care of you, okay?
is he seizing?
was there a head injury involved?
uh, what is that music?
um, sir, no.
um, you probably don't wannaget off of that if you don't
what are you doing?
what is-- what are you doing?
what are you... what are you doing?
wait? What?
what is going on?
I'm...
Oh, my god!
they're everywhere.
Oh, god!
it's so high!
who'd have thought kepner would've found somebody as dorky as she is?
he is like the male kepner.
what are the odds?
all right, april! - oh, my god.
uh, april, I know that this seems crazy... - this is totally crazy.
what?
and to some, sudden.
but when I know something, I know it.
when I first saw you standing in this doorway... I felt a shock.
and, uh, and I thought... this is the most beautiful person that I've ever seen.
and then I thought... Yeah, well, no, I-I knew...
that I was gonna fall in love with you.
Oh, god.
and I have never been so happy knowing anything in my entire life.
Oh, my... oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life trying to make you as happy as you make me...
Oh, my god.
if you'll let me.
will you marry me?
Yes. Yes it was beautiful!
way to go, matthew!
many happy years!
all right, matthew!
how does kepner get that?
how does that happen?
and I get crazy, I get cancer, and now I gota psychopathic maniac.
screw it. I give up. I'm walking away.
Alex, what were you gonna do if you got to peckwell's house first?
were you gonna have coffee and talk it out?
I mean, tell me he wouldn't have been worse off had you gotten there first.
people change, but they don't change.
maybe jo's crazy fits your crazy.
don't give up on her just yet.
we didn't give up on you.
chest peckwell is awake.
how is he?
he's fine.
but he's--he's asking for the police.
I thought this storm was coming in three days.
you know weather guys.
they're wrong most of the time, and they still keep their jobs.
how do you feel, honestly?
honestly?
I'd feel better if the wall hadn't dissected.
I'm afraid it's done more harm than good.
how did I miss this clot?
you didn't, or it'd still be in there.
you've done everything you can.
then why isn't he awake?
he looks beautiful.
Yeah, and when he's 6 feet tall and has a full head of hair, all of this is gonna recede to just a tiny, little scar on his forehead.
the girls are gonna love it. it'll give him some mystery.
thank you... So much.
amazing.
this was an amazing day.
well, you guys did most of the work.
I'm happy I just got to watch.
Yeah, well, is there anything else that I can...
you can show meto an on-call room.
uh... W-why?
first night post-op, I like to stay close by in case anything happens.
Oh, wow, you poor, poor control freak.
Oh, you really get me.
Yeah. I really do.
this way.
cops here yet?
let's talk for a second.
she attacked me, all right? jo's a lunatic. She's disturbed, and she's a liar.
listen... you got a good thing here.
good job.
nice place.
you have friends here?
Oh, you want to bemy friend now?
me?
Nah.
I got enough friends.
Cristina yang-- she's my friend.
she owns the hospital.
owns the hospital.
Meredith grey--her name's on the friggin' door.
and these are my friends.
and they don't like a guy who hits his girlfriend.
neither do i.
she attacked me.
what was I supposed to do?
you're supposed to take it.
a girl hits you, you take it, or you walk away.
it's the story of my life.
Jason, you can tell this story till you're blue in the face, but all people are gonna hear is that you hit her.
and that little bit-- it's gonna follow you around the halls here.
and if you leave, it'll get wherever you're going before you do.
Oh, you'll make sure of that, huh?
it sounds like you're blackmailing me.
it sounds like you're a guy who hits girls,' cause you did.
so what do you want to do next?
What'd he say?
what, you heard that?
I did.
you think it's okay to blackmail people, karev?
I wasn't.
it was just a threat.
you're threatening him?
what are you thinking?
a bunch of people got hurt here.
I didn't see the point in any more.
I mean, the guy's not pressing charges.
Oh, so it all works out.
you feel good about that?
because you shouldn't.
Bailey, when the chief of surgery orders you to scrub in on a surgery, you scrub in on that surgery.
the last I heard, you'renotchief of surgery or my boss.
but I am part owner of this hospital, which does, in fact, make me your boss.
and you're not a file clerk.
we have enough file clerks.
but we need a surgeons.
so eitherbea surgeon, or get the hell out.
cause we don't need you.
he looks great.
he is.
broken leg, minor internal injuries.
after all that, it turned out to be kind of a nothing case.
you had absolutely no right to kick me out of that o. r. Today.
Grey, you weren't necessary that
you did it because I'm pregnant and because you were trying to protect me.
Yes. And?
I just want you to know it's completely unacceptable.
and thank you.
noted.
you asked me about zola today.
we just knew.
you know, derek knew first, of course, because he's derek, and it took me a little longer because I-I was... Scared.
one day, I just picked her up, and...
I just knew.
I don't know how else to explain it.
I looked at her, and she was my daughter.
I just knew.
you know, this kid-- he needs someone, and I like him, and, uh, and he likes me.
he's scared and alone and... And... I could help.
I know how to help, and I want to.
and then I talk myself out of it because he's not my kid.
he's 10.
it's... It's a huge commitment.
it's a lifetime of responsibility.
and it pretty much uproots everything.
but then I spend one minute with this kid, and... I can't imagine not doing it.
you're thinking I'm crazy.
no. I'm thinking that's exactly the way I felt.
Cristina won't get it.
it's paul.
you should come.
he's awake. he's fine. Uh, neuro's good, he's talking.
he's fine.
get him set for transfer to seattle pres.
well, isn't that a little-- I want them out of here a. s.a. p.
the storm's here sooner than predicted, and I want them moved inland before it gets worse.
I've rounded on your entire service.
brooks, thanks.
you've stepped up when I needed it today.
I'm proud of you.
thank you, sir.
give it up.
stay weird, brooks.
with me, ross.
God, there's more?
never saw it coming, right?
what's that, the storm?
no. April. I was sure someone would let it slip.
and have you, uh, seen DR. Hunt?
no, no. What's up? nothing.
I--i'd... Would you tell him thanks, though?
I had him keep april out of surgeries all day.
this was kind of my only shot at this.
didn't wanna miss it.
no, no, you didn't.
congratulations, both of you guys. - Thanks.
still awake?
Yes, ma'am.
owen's, uh, transferring paul dawson and his kid over to seattle pres.
how's owen? - I don't know.
you know, I woke the guy up.
that's all he's been wanting to do, but now he just seems more disappointed with me, and I know he's got close to the kid.
you know, owen was talking about taking the kid himself.
taking him?
what, like a-adopting him?
or fostering.
he asked me about it. He seemed ready to do it.
okay, what am I supposed to do with that?
like, what am I supposed to do?
I don't think there's anything you can do.
I don't think it's about you.
thank you.
you guys have backup generators, right?
Yeah, of course we do.
this really has been a lot of fun.
sort of sorry-- me, too.
I'm sorry it's over.
Yeah.
all right, well, then you'll just have to have me back at some point.
that would be really great.
okay.
Oh, god!
I can't. - what?
I can't.
we do our very best.
it was a pleasure meeting you.
you are allowed to lose a little bit of control.
but sometimes it's just not good enough.
we buckle our seat belts.
we wear a helmet.
we stick to the lighted paths.
what the hell happened?
the power went out a half-hour-- no, you.
what were you thinking?
peckwell could have died.
is he
no, he's fine, and you're lucky he's not pressing charges, but you are an idiot.
you get that you could have gone to jail, right?
you say that you worked so hard to change, to become this new person, but then you do this?
if you don't wanna be a lowlife anymore, you gotta grow upand stop acting like one.
no, you grow up!
not everyone's like you, alex.
people are horrible.
and the last time someone grabbed me like jason did, I...
I promised no one would ever do that again.
so I am sorry, but... not everyone's like you.
not everyone's good.
we try to be safe.
and now you think I'm horrible, too.
no.
no. If you hadn't gotten to him first, I probably would have killed the guy.
Why? why would you do that for me?
shut up.
why wouldn't i?
we try so hard to protect ourselves, but it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.
cause when the bad things come, they come out of nowhere.
the storm is here.
it's totally here.
the, uh, day care center said they're gonna be open for 24 hours, so I'm keeping sofia in there.
we're not leaving. are you guys leaving?
I don't know.
where the hell is arizona?
we're gonna stay, right?
Yes, we're gonna stay.
cause if we get trapped at the house, and you go into labor...
no, we're staying because they need surgeons.
you need to take it easy.
I'm just gonna work until I
the bad things come suddenly with no warning.
what? meredith, what is it?
but we forget... - you okay?
Yeah.
that sometimes...
Yeah. My water just broke.
what?
okay. - Okay.
okay.
that's how the good things come, too.
okay.
come ON.
come ON. COME ON.
come ON, COME ON, ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
that's GOOD. YOU'RE DOING GOOD, DR. BURKE.

to YOUR THUMB.

I CUT THE LVAD WIRE. NO, I DID IT.
I'm THE ONE WHO CUT THE WIRE.

I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I'M TOTALLY INNOCENT. ALEX.
that's NOT THE POINT. WE MADE AN AGREEMENT.
I DIDN'T EVEN-- I WASN'T HERE. I TOLD YOU GUYS THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.
people! I KNOW WHO DID THIS,
so YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME CLEAN.
I KNOW. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,

the COLOR DOES MATTER.
maybe NOT TO YOU, BUT IT DOES MATTER.
not TO BOTHER YOU, BUT...

the PROBLEM IS THE COLORS AND--AND THE BALLOONS

Hey, LET'S GO WITH 'TEARS IN HEAVEN.'
no, THAT'S TOO MORBID. IT SHOULD BE PINK.
it SHOULD BE RED." IT SHOULD BE A FREAKIN' RAINBOW.
what HE'S SAYING IS THAT WE'RE VERY, VERY HOPEFUL
that YOU SPEAK TEENAGE GIRL. SILVER AND WHITE
it's MYSTICAL AND MAGICAL WITHOUT BEING OVER THE TOP.
ever SEE FASHION WEEK IN NEW YORK?
lots OF SILVER AND WHITE RUNWAYS AND BACKDROPS.
that's BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT COLOR THE CLOTHES ARE, THEY POP.
they POP? THEY POP.
O'malley AND KAREV, GET 500 BALLOONS
in SILVER AND WHITE AND A HUNDRED IN BLACK.
shiny BLACK, NOT THE MATTE.
yang, STICK WITH CAMILLE.
keep HER HAPPY, KEEP HER SPIRITS UP.
Grey, GET WITH PATRICIA, MAKE SURE WE CAN ROPE OFF
the SECOND FLOOR NURSES' STATION AND THE WAITING AREA.
got IT?
Oh, NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T GET TO LOOK AT ME LIKE TT.
no, YOU COMPROMISED MY MEDICAL LICENSE.
you NEARLY KILLED A PATIENT, LIED TO THE CHIEF OF SURGERY
and MADE ME, YOUR RESIDENT, LOOK BAD.
now WE'RE GONNA DO THIS PROM, AND WE'RE DOIN' IT RIGHT. MOVE.
can YOU...
Yeah.
Hey.
you NEVER CALLED. WHAT?
last NIGHT. WE HAD PLANS, AND YOU WENT OFF WITH IZZIE,
and YOU NEVER CALLED. YEAH.
you SAID YOU WOULD. A LOT OF STUFF WENT DOWN LAST NIGHT.
what EXACTLY HAPPENED?
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.
Oh, COME ON. I'M NOT GONNA TELL, GEORGE. IT'S ME.
look, IT'S VEGAS.
what HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM STAYS IN THAT ROOM. OKAY.
Yeah, I GET IT.
Hey.
do YOU WANT TO GO TO PROM WITH ME?
no, GEORGE! NO.
I DON'T WANT TO GO PROM WITH YOU.
what WAS THAT ABOUT?
she SAID SHE LOVED ME.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh! HEY.
I've BEEN CALLING YOUR CELL ALL NIGHT.
um... OH, WELL, IT'S, UH...
it's A LONG STORY, WHICH ESSENTIALLY ENDS
with ME INVITING YOU TO A PROM.
an ACTUAL PROM?
a CORSAGES AND TUXEDOES
Yeah, I KNOW, IT'S STUPID, BUT...
no, I'M IN. I LOVED PROM.
I MEAN, I-I DON'T WANT TO BRAG OR ANYTHING,
but I WAS CROWNED KING.
Really? YOU WERE THAT KID IN HIGH SCHOOL?
what IS WRONG WITH BEING THAT KID?
nothing. IT'S VERY CUTE, ACTUALLY.
hello.
Hi.
what ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?
doc HAD SOME SEIZURES LAST NIGHT.
pretty SERIOUS.
the CANCER HAS SPREAD TO HIS BRAIN.
I'm SORRY.
Hey.
Hey.
how's PRESTON?
he's RECOVERING NICELY.
Addison... I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
all RIGHT.
I MEAN, WE'VE COME SO FAR-- YOU FORGAVE ME FOR MARK...
Mm-hmm. AND WE'RE TRYING.
we ARE. WE'RE TRYING. WE ARE TRYING.
we're TRYING. WE'RE TRYING.
and I WAS JEALOUS WHEN THERE WAS NO NEED TO BE.
right?
what?
will YOU GO TO THE PROM WITH ME?
I WENT TO COLLEGE ON A WRESTLING SCHOLARSHIP.
I PLAYED BASEBALL, SOME BASKETBALL,
but, YOU KNOW, WE'LL GO WITH FOOTBALL. WHAT THE HELL DOES FOOTBALL
have TO DO WITH WHO CUT THE LVAD WIRES?
let's SAY YOU WERE DRAFTED TO A TEAM
that WASN'T YOUR FIRST PICK.
you KNOW, YOU DON'T-- YOU DON'T LIKE THE PLAYERS,
you HATE THE WAY THEY PLAY THE GAME,
you EVEN THINK THE QUARTERBACK IS FULL OF CRAP.
the QUARTERBACK'S A PAIN IN THE ASS
that YOU DON'T OWE A DAMN THING TO.
but... IT'S YOUR TEAM.
you DON'T QUIT,
you DON'T TALK TO THE PRESS,
you DON'T... BITCH TO THE COACH.
you JUST...
you JUST GO OUT THERE EVERY SUNDAY,
and YOU MAKE THE BLOCKS, AND YOU TAKE THE HITS,
and YOU--YOU PLAY TO WIN.
you SHOW UP, AND YOU SUIT UP, AND YOU PLAY,
because IT'S YOUR FREAKIN' TEAM.
I KNOW YOUR TYPE.
you're A SURGICAL JUNKIE.
Yes, SIR.
I'm JUST SAYING,
it's NOT GONNA BE EASY FOR YOU TO BE AWAY
from THE O. R. THAT LONG.
no, SIR.
and IF YOUANT TO GET BACK TO THE O. R.
you're GONNA TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO KNOW, AREN'T YOU?
you're RIGHT.
it's NOT EASY FOR ME TO BE AWAY FROM THE O. R.
it's NOT EASY FOR ME TO SIT IN FRONT OF YOU,
or ANY OTHER AUTHORITY FIGURE FOR THAT MATTER,
and NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU
the EXACT ANSWER YOU WANT TO HEAR.
I'm THE ONE WITH THE ANSWERS.
I've ALWAYS BEEN THE ONE WITH THE ANSWERS.
but RIGHT NOW, SIR, I DON'T HAVE ANY.
Dr. YANG
how DO YOU KEEP YOUR EDGE, SIR?
because I WATCH YOU, AND YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME,
and YOU'RE CLEAN.
you're FOCUSED, YOU ARE THE JOB,
nothing GETS TO YOU.
and THE THING IS, SIR, IS I WAS LIKE THAT
until I GOT HERE,
until I ACTUALLY STARTED DOING THIS JOB.
and NOW EVERYTHING IS...
is FUZZY OR
that's BESIDE THE POINT. NO, SEE, SIR? THIS IS THE POINT.
because I CAN'T TELL YOU
what HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM.
I CAN'T TELL YOU,
and BEFORE, I COULD HAVE
no GUILT, NO LOYALTIES, NO PROBLEM.
BEFORE--BEFORE, I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN IN THAT ROOM.
I WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN INVOLVED,
I WOULD HAVE NEVER FROZEN IN SURGERY,
and I WOULD'VE TOLD HIM WHAT I THOUGHT HE SHOULD DO.
I HAD AN EDGE, SIR.
I HAD AN EDGE, AND I'VE LOST IT.
and I NEED IT.
I NEED IT BACK.
so...
if YOU COULD JUST TELL ME HOW YOU KEEP YOURS
and HOW NOT TO BE AFFECTED...
I KNOW I COULD BE A GREAT SURGEON.
so IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME THE ANSWERS,
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
you're EXCUSED, DR. YANG.
but
you're EXCUSED.
I'll TELL YOU.
I'll TELL YOU WHO CUT THE LVAD WIRE, SIR... NO, YOU WON'T.
if YOU COULD JUST PLEASE-- I DON'T WANT TO KNOW,
not FROM YOU.
Yeah, I HAVE THE ANSWERS, BUT I CAN'T TELL 'EM TO YOU.
I'm NOT GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU BECOMING LESS HUMAN.
I'm A PRETTY GIRL.
what?
I'm NOT BEING ARROGANT, IT'S JUST...
it's JUST KIND OF A FACT.
for A LONG TIME, I MADE A CAREER FROM MY LOOKS,
so I GET IT-- I'M A PRETTY GIRL.
and NOT IN A "FROM "A CERTAIN ANGLE" WAY,
in AN OBVIOUS WAY.
it's THE BLONDE THING AND THE BIG BOOBS THING.
big BOOBS ARE KEY TO OBVIOUS PRETTY,
if YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. DR. STEVENS
that's HOW MEN SEE ME.
I'm NOT A SMART GIRL
or AN INTERESTING GIRL, I'M A PRETTY GIRL.
the BLONDE AND THE BOOBS, IT CONFUSES GUYS
into THINKING THAT I'M SOMEONE ELSE.
and I'M USED TO IT.
I'm USED TO THEM WALKING AWAY WHEN THEY REALIZE...
but THEN DENNY GOES AND ASKS ME TO MARRY HIM.
is THAT WHY YOU CUT THE WIRES?
he DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I'M A PRETTY GIRL.
he MAKES ME FEEL LIKE...
like ME.
I THINK HE MIGHT KNOW ME.
and SO IF I DID CUT THE LVAD WIRE,
and I'M NOT SAYING THAT I DID,
but IF I DID...
then, NO, I DON'T FEEL GUILTY.
and I KNOW THAT I SHOULD,
and I WOULD IF IT WERE ANYBODY ELSE.
but I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING BUT HAPPY.
aren't YOU GONNA...
say ANYTHING OR...
I'm NOT GONNA BREAK.
I'm STARTING TO GET A LITTLE FREAKED OUT,
but I'M NOT GONNA BREAK.
it's NOT BECAUSE I DON'T CARE,
because I DO CARE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ME,
I DO...
care.
I JUST CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR...
which SEEMS TO BE A THEME IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.
just BCAUSE YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING
doesn't MEAN YOU DON'T WANT TO.
you CAN WANT TO VERY MUCH.
you CAN BE WITH A PERSON AND BE HAPPY WITH THEM
and NOT LOVE THEM,
or YOU CAN LOVE SOMEONE AND NOT WANT TO BE WITH THEM.
you DON'T NEED TO. LOVE SOMEONE
to WANT THEM.
Oh, IT'S FRUSTRATING.
you KNOW, WHEN YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOU WHAT YOU WANT
and WHAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT DON'T MATCH UP,
it's EXHAUSTING.
and... WELL, IT'S COMPLICATED.
but THAT'S LIFE.
and LIFE...
sucks.
I've KNOWN YOU FOR A LONGIME.
I KNOW YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER.
and I KNOW BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT
that YOU DID NOT CUT THOSE LVAD WIRES.
I NEED YOU TELL ME WHO DID IT.
I've BEEN GOING OVER THIS AND OVER THIS IN MY MIND,
trying TO PIECE THIS TOGETHER.
it WAS YOU.
you're THE REASON MY PARENTS BROKE UP.
and IT WASN'T JUST AN AFFAIR.
she REALLY LOVED YOU.
it WASN'T JUST THIS CHEAP THING
where SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU SHE WAS MARRIED.
it WASN'T ALL A LIE.
she LEFT HER HUSBAND FOR YOU.
but YOU STAYED WITH YOUR WIFE
because IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
maybe SAFE,
but SHE WAS THE RIGHT PERSON FOR YOU TO BE WITH.
and LET'S FACE IT,
my MOTHER?
nothing WRONG WITH BEING SAFE,
being WITH THE GOOD GUY BECAUSE HE'S GOOD.
and WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FOREVER HERE.
you've NEVER REGRETTED YOUR DECISION.
you've NEVER LOOKED BACK.
right?
says WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT DOC.
good FOR FINN.
can WE JUST DO THIS ONE THING TOGETHER
without ARGUING?
fine.
I THINK WE MAY HAVE TO PUT HIM TO SLEEP.
whatever YOU WANT TO DO.
what IF THERE'S A CHANCE HE CAN GET BETTER?
he's NOT GONNA GET BETTER.
you KNOW THAT.
well, FINN THINKS WE SHOULD DO IT TODAY, THEN.
Denny. WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
visiting HOURS AREN'T FOR ANOTHER HOUR.
you ARE NO LONGER HIS DOCTOR.
you WANT TO SEE DENNY, YOU COME BACK WHEN THE VISITORS COME.
I WOULD, BUT I CAN'T WAIT.
on THE INSUBORDINATION.
but IT'S MY TURN. IF THE CHIEF FINDS OUT
you WERE EVEN ON THIS FLOOR-- HOLD ON. IT'S HER TURN.
Yes.
my ANSWER IS YES.
Oh, NOW, SEE?
you're GONNA MAKE MY HEART STOP BEATING,
and IT'S BRAND-NEW.
I WILL CALL SECURITY ON YOU.
okay.
I WILL COME BACK DURING VISITING HOURS.
and IT'S PROM, SO I'LL SHOW YOU MY DRESS.
okay.
I'm GOING.
you DID GOOD.
I TRICKED HER INTO MARRYING ME.
how SMART AM I?
we're THROWING A PROM.
the CHIEF'S MAKING US THROW A PROM.
O'malley MENTIONED.
george CAME TO SEE YOU?
he's MY FRIEND.
Oh.
I WON'T BEAR A GRUDGE.
what DID YOU...
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF ME.
I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME,
but I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF ME.
and IF THIS...
if YOU CAN'T STAY HERE FOR THIS...
I WON'T BEAR A GRUDGE.
are YOU GONNA TELL SHEPHERD ABOUT...
not YET.
I'm, UH...
not YET.
okay, THERE'S A COUPLE OF FORMS YOU NEED TO SIGN.
I ONLY NEED ONE SIGNATURE.
well, YOU
it's FINE.
here, I'LL SIGN.
so HOW DO WE DO THIS?
well, I'LL GIVE DOC AN INJECTION OF THOLE TO MAKE HIM SLEEPY,
and THEN I'LL GIVE HIM AN I. V. INJECTION OF PHENOBARBITAL.
and THAT'LL STOP HIS HEART.
Yes.
and WHAT DO WE DO AFTER, WITH HIS BODY?
we CAN...
we HAVE THE MEANS TO DISPOSE OF IT FOR YOU.
that's FINE. GO AHEAD.
we CAN'T THROW HIM AWAY LIKE HE'S GARBAGE.
we WOULD NEVER-- HE'S OUR DOG, DEREK.
there's THAT, UH, CLEARING BY THE TRAILER.
over LOOKIN THE WATER.
we CAN, UH, BURY HIM THERE.
that SOUNDS NICE.
you READY?
Yeah.
I'm SO SORRY, DOC.
I'm SORRY, TOO.
that's THE HOSPITAL. I GOTTA GO.
okay.
okay.
okay.
I'll BEGIN.
it's OKAY.
it's OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
it's OKAY.
it's OKAY.
he's GONE.
no, I HAVE TO GO HOME AND CHANGE.
I'll SEE YOU LATER, OKAY? MEREDITH...
I'm SORRY... FOR YOUR LOSS.
Yeah. YOU KNOW, THE THING IS,
he WASN'T REALLY MY DOG FOR THAT LONG.
he WAS MORE DEREK'S DOG.
he WAS A GOOD DOG.
he WAS.
Oh, I'M TOO TIRED FOR THIS.
Where's YOUR HUSBAND, DR. BAILEY?
uh, AT HOME WITH THE BABY.
thought YOU'D AT LEAST GET TO GET OUTTA THIS.
Why?
well, WITH BURKE UPSTAIRS...
what HAPPENED TO HIM,
I'm SURE THE CHIEF WOULD'VE LET YOU OUT
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
have YOU SEEN MEREDITH?
I DON'T THINK SHE'S HERE YET.
this WHOLE THING IS BRINGING BACK
very TRAUMATIC MEMORIES OF BEING A BAND GEEK
with BRACES AND A LISP AND SPENDING THE WHOLE EVENING
with SKIPPY GOLD TALKING ABOUT "STAR WARS.
so, YOU WANT TO, UM, DANCE?
love TO.
can I CUT IN?
what DID YOU SAY TO MY BOYFRIEND
to MAKE HIM THAT SCARED OF YOU?
I'm A FRIGHTENING MAN, CAMMIE.
no, YOU'RE NOT.
where BRIAN'S CONCERNED, YES, I AM.
be KIND TO HIM.
he LOVES ME.
I've BEEN LOVED.
and THAT'S SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE
once IN THEIR LIFE.
I've BEEN LOVED.
thank YOU FOR THE PROM, UNCLE RICHARD.
you're WELCOME.
Hey, I WAS LOOKING FOR. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I'm WEARING A DRESS, I HAVE ON HEELS,
I SHAVED MY LEGS. I'M GOING TO THE PROM.
you SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO. NO, I SAID I DIDN'T WANT TO GO WITH YOU.
I SAID, "I LOVE YOU." I SAID IT.
I SAID IT OUT LOUD TO YOUR FACE,
and EVER SINCE YOU
I HAVE NEVER SAID THAT TO A GUY BEFORE, NEVER.
and NOW I AM JUST THIS IDIOT WHO SAYS I LOVE YOU
and THEN GETS AVOIDED. NO, I'M NOT AVOIDING YOU.
I PROMISE.
you GONNA SAY IT BACK?
no.
I'm HUMILIATED.
no, GEORGE, LET ME GO.
George, LEME GO.
let ME GO.
let ME GO. STOP FIGHTING ME.
if I SAY IT BACK RIGHT NOW,
you KNOW I'M JUST SAYIN' IT BECAUSE YOU SAID IT TO ME.
when I-- WHEN I SAY I LOVE YOU,
I WANT TO MEAN IT BECAUSE...
you--you JUST HAVE TO GIVE ME SOME TIME TO MEAN IT.
I HATE THAT I'M SO INTO YOU.
you're A LOT HOTTER THAN MY LAST PROM DATE.
is THAT A COMPLIMENT?
maybe.
it FEELS LIKE A COMPLIMENT.
then IT IS.
well, KEEP IT UP. YOU MIGHT GET LUCKY.
well, NOW HOW LUCKY ARE WE TALKING?
are WE TALKING KINDA LUCKY,
or ARE WE TALKING REALLY SERIOUSLY LUCKY?
you HAVE BEEN A VERY PATIENT MAN,
and I APPRECIATE IT.
what?
Liz, UH
Liz WAS MY WIFE
and WHEN SHE DIED...
you GET THIS THING, YOU KNOW,
where YOU STOP MAKING PLANS.
because YOU HAD PLANS, BUT THEN THERE'S A CAR CRASH
and YOUR PLANS DISAPPEARED.
so YOU JUST...
I JUST TRY AND GET FROM SUNUP TO SUNDOWN.
that's AS FAR INTO THE FUTURE AS I CAN HANDLE.
and I'VE BEEN FINE WITH THAT. I HAVE.
but RIGHT NOW, LOOKING AT YOU...
damn, I-I HAVE ALL KINDS OF PLANS.
don't FREAK OUT.
I'm NOT.
you're NOT?
no.
you HAVE PLANS.
I HAVE PLANS.
you ALL RIGHT?
Yeah, IT'S JUST, UH,
hot AND... CLAUSTROPHOBIC.
you KNOW WHAT? THERE'S A PATIENT I'VE GOTTA GO CHECK ON.
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA RUN
and SPLASH SOME COLD WATER ON MY FACE.
I'll BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?
okay. ALL RIGHT.
leave ME ALONE.
just LEAVE ME ALONE.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE ALL RIG.
No! I'M NOT ALL RIGHT. OKAY? ARE YOU SATISFIED?
I'm NOT ALL RIGHT,
because YOU HAVE A WIFE,
and YOU CALL ME A WHORE, AND OUR DOG DIED.
and NOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME. STOP LOOKING AT ME.
I'm NOT LOOKING AT YOU. I AM NOT LOOKING AT YOU.
you ARE LOOKING AT ME,
and YOU WATCH ME.
and FINN HAS PLANS.
and I LIKE FINN, HE'S PERFECT FOR ME,
and I'M REALLY TRYING HERE TO BE HAPPY.
and I CAN'T BREATHE.
I CAN'T BREATHE WITH YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT,
so JUST STOP!
do YOU THINK I WANT TO LOOK AT YOU?
that I WOULDN'T RATHER BE LOOKING AT MY WIFE?
I'm MARRIED. I HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES.
she--she DOESN'T DRIVE ME CRAZY,
she DOESN'T MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO FEEL NORMAL,
she DOESN'T MAKE ME SICK TO MY STOMACH
thinking ABOUT MY VETERINARIAN TOUCHING HER WITH HIS HANDS!
Oh, MAN, I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING NOT TO BE LOOKING AT YOU.
whoa. YOU LOOK NICE.
thank YOU. SO DO YOU. HOT DATE?
Nah. THIS THING IS CHEESY.
I WOULDN'T WASTE A DECENT CHICK ON THIS.
you HEADIN' IN?
Yeah, I'M JUST GONNA SEE DENNY FIRST.
Oh, OKAY.
what DOES THIS MEAN?
uh, I HAD PANTIES ON. BLACK. DO YOU SEE THEM?
Meredith, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
help ME LOOK FOR THEM. AND FIX YOUR TIE. MEREDITH...
what DOES THIS MEAN?
Oh, THE NURSE TOLD ME TO COME FIND YOU.
you HAVE TO COME NOW. IT'S IZZIE.
wait, WAIT, WAIT.
okay, GO.
chief.
I DID MY INTERNSHIP HERE,
my RESIDENCY,
came BACK HERE THE MINUTE MY FELLOWSHIP WAS DONE.
the DAY THEY TOLD ME I WOULD BE CHIEF,
I WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE IN THAT O. R.
spent MY WHOLE CAREER IN THIS HOSPITAL.
my WHOLE LIFE.
sir...
Denny DUQUETTE DIED AT 7: 42 THIS EVENING.
damn IT.
what HAPPENED? I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I DIDN'T THINK YOU GUYS WOULD WANT ME TO GO TO THE CHIEF-- WHERE IS SHE?
she's IN THERE WITH HIM.
I THINK IT WAS A STROKE.
he WAS PRONE TO BLOOD CLOTS.
a CLOT COULD HAVE FORMED ON HIS SUTURES,
traveled TO HIS BRAIN.
it ONLY TAKES A SECOND.
Dr. HAHN DID A BEAUTIFUL JOB ON THE SURGERY.
but I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T THINK OF BLOOD CLOTS.
he DIED ALL ALONE.
he WAS ALONE.
there WAS NOTHING YOU COULD'VE DONE.
I CHANGED MY DRESS THREE TIMES.
I WANTED TO LOOK NICE.
I WOULD'VE BEEN HERE SOONER...
but I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHICH DRESS TO WEAR.
we SHOULDN'T BE IN HERE.
iz, THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY NEED
they NEED TO MOVE HIM.
take HIM TO THE MORGUE.
you CAN'T STAY HERE. I KNOW YOU WANT TO
can YOU PLEASE, PLEASE JUST GET OUT?
I WANT TO BE ALONE WITH DENNY.
Izzie, THAT'S NOT DENNY.
shut UP.
that's NOT DENNY.
the MINUTE HIS HEART STOPPED BEATING,
he STOPPED BEING DENNY.
now I KNOW YOU LOVE HIM,
but HE ALSO LOVED YOU.
he DOESN'T WANT YOU TO DO THIS TO YOURSELF.
because IT'S NOT DENNY,
not ANYMORE.
an HOUR AGO, HE WAS PROPOSING.
and NOW...
and NOW HE'S GOING TO THE MORGUE.
isn't THAT RIDICULOUS?
isn't THAT THE MOST RIDICULOUS PIECE OF CRAP
you've EVER HEARD?
come ON.
I'm SORRY. THESE ARE RIDIC--HEY.
Hi. DEREK, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
uh, I WAS WITH A PATIENT. SHEPHERD.
yes? HAVE YOU SEEN BAILEY'S INTERNS
I'm LOOKING FOR IZZIE STEVENS IN PARTICULAR.
no, I HAVEN'T. NO. CHIEF.
it WAS ME.
I CUT HIS LVAD WIRE.
I DID IT. NO ONE HELPED ME.
and NOW...
I THOUGHT I WAS A SURGEON, BUT...
I CAN'T.
I THOUGHT I WAS A SURGEON, BUT I AM NOT.
so I QUIT.
well, I GUESS THAT...
puts AN END TO THE EVENING.
Yeah.
Yeah, I GUESS IT DOES.
come ON. I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.
come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on, all right, good. That's good.
you're doing good, Dr. Burke.
okay, I need you to touch each finger of your right hand to your thumb.
one... two...
you're doing great. Keep going.
three. Good. One more.
that's good. That's...
Dr. Hahn-- - wait for it.
Dr. Hahn. - Just wait!
I cut the LVAD wire.
actually...
I cut the LVAD wire. - no, I did it.
I'm the one who cut the wire.
fine. I cut the LVAD wire.
I didn't do anything.
I'm totally innocent.
Alex. - That's not the point. - We made an agreement.
I didn't even-- - I wasn't here.
I told you guys this was a bad idea. - People!
I know who did this, so you might as well come clean.
I know.
with all due respect, sir, if you knew, you wouldn't be asking us.
I did what I-- - you have your suspicions, but you don't actually know.
not for sure.
and you can't do anything to any of us without proof, sir.
well, one of you compromised a patient's life.
one of you stole an organ.
one of you jeopardized the integrity of this hospital and of U. N.O. S.
now you tell me, and you tell me right now!
all right, fine.
no surgeries.
sir?
no one scrubs in, no one so much as goes near the O. R. Floor.
until someone confesses, the five of you will share a single patient.
whatever she wants, the five of you will provide it.
now get the hell out of my sight.
I will go back and tell him.
I will tell him it was me.
and get kicked out of the program?
you will keep your mouth shut.
we all will keep our mouths shut.
this is crap.
I'm turning her in.
Alex. - What?
you were the one who said we had to stand by Izzie.
I am sorry, - and I really do appreciate what you did for denny. - Oh, shut up.
look, the only reason I lied to Burke is because I wanted in on that transplant surgery.
I don't care about denny, - and I hope you get thrown out on your ass. - hey, we stick together.
you know, we all did this.
nobody's a victim.
we--we stick together.
damn it.
thank you.
you're welcome. - we can handle this.
Camille Travis is a kid with cancer.
so we get her whatever she wants for a couple of days.
how hard can that be?
harder than you might think.
this Claire and Natalie
Camille Travis' friends.
her very best friends in the whole wide world.
girls, who exactly is Camille Travis?
like, the chief of surgery's niece.
and, girls, what does the chief of surgery's niece want, exactly?
like, a prom.
no. Like, the best prom ever.
we need a theme.
a theme.
Ooh! Ooh!
can we have sparkly lights?
because sparkly lights are amazing!
I didn't like teenage girls when I was a teenage girl.
I wore a lot of black.
Ohh. - Mm.
had the whole "angry, pink hair thing" going on.
wouldn't have been caught dead at a prom.
my mother made me go.
my date barfed on my dress and then tried to feel me up.
you look...
God, you look amazing.
they always tell you that transplant patients rebound fast, but, you know, to see it in person...
I have warm hands.
I've never had warm hands because of my circulation.
feel.
warm hands.
and check it out
I have a regular heartbeat.
Yes, you do.
I should, um.
I gotta go.
I would stay, but if Bailey catches me here, she'd...
and, uh, you know, the chief has us doing this prom thing.
it's so...
you look...
WHOO-HOO, Denny.
okay, I'm gonna go.
what? - Huh?
you like your men sick and feeble?
you don't dig healthy guys?
I...
I dig you.
then why are you all swirly and twitchy?
no, I'm not.
it's because I asked you to marry me.
so you remember that?
it's not the kind of thing i'd forget.
Yeah.
look, Denny, um,
I'm giving you an out.
excuse me?
I'm giving you an out. I mean, you thought you were dying, and I was saving your life.
and, you know, everything was so...
we can't get married.
I mean, that would be crazy, insane.
we should date and have sex, plenty of sex.
you know, when your heart gets better, and you' out of the hospit
all the sex you can handle.
but marriage is, M...
marriage, I mean
it's my turn now.
but I need to-- - no, no, no.
we're taking turns.
I've decided.
it's polite, and it keeps me from yelling.
when it's your turn again, you can talk.
for five years,
I've had to live by the choices of my doctors.
the guys that cut me open decided my life.
there wasn't one choice that was mine.
and now...
I have this heart that beats and works.
I get to be like everybody else.
I get to make my own decisions, have my own life, do whatever the damn hell i choose.
now here's the good part, so you listen close.
what I choose...
is you.
you're who I want to wake up with and go to bed with and do everything in between with.
I get a choice now.
I get to choose.
I choose you, Izzie Stevens.
it's your turn again.
they're not talking.
wagons have been circled.
somebody's gotta take responsibility.
I can tell you what I think happened, what I assume happened, but they're the only ones tt know it.
I want to meet with each of them separately.
I will break them.
all right, then.
you have your dress for the prom?
excuse me?
I'm going to the prom.
if I have to go, everybody has to go.
Wha--I'm a grown woman.
everybody goes to the prom!
everybody!
central high
two years ago, they went with all black.
and they had, like, purple lights.
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
everybody looked like ghouls.
fine. We could go with all white.
are you having a seizure?
will that get me out of here?
fine.
let's go with seizure.
for the love of god, you people need to get a life!
the chief's niece.
it's okay.
the hot ones e always mean.
it's like a rule or something.
don't you dare try to judge us.
we're trying to make our friend, who just happens to be dying of cancer, happy.
the color does matter.
maybe not to you, but it does matter.
not to bother you, but...
what?
one of you better spit out the problem right now.
the problem is the colors and
and the balloons and the "under the sea.
no, it's 'Titanic.'
Hey, let's go with 'Tears in heaven.'
no, that's too morbid.
it should be pink.
it should be red.
it should be a freakin' rainbow.
what he's saying is that we're very, very hopeful that you speak teenage girl.
silver and white.
it's mystical and magical without being over the top.
ever see fashion week in New York?
lots of silver and white runways and backdrops.
that's because no matter what color the clothes are, they pop.
they pop? - They pop.
O'malley and Karev, get 500 balloons in silver and white and a hundred in black.
shiny black, not the matte.
yang, stick with Camille.
keep her happy, keep her spirits up.
Grey, get with Patricia, make sure we can rope off the second floor nurses' station and the waiting area.
got it?
Oh, no, no, no.
you don't get to look at me like it.
no, you compromised my medical license.
you nearly killed a patient, lied to the chief of surgery and made me, your resident, look bad.
now we're gonna do this prom, and we're doin' it right. Move.
can you... - yeah.
Hey.
you never called.
what?
last night.
we had plans, and you went off with Izzie, - and you never called. - Yeah.
you said you would. - A lot of stuff went down last night.
what exactly happened?
I can't talk about it.
Oh, come on.
I'm not gonna tell, George.
it's me.
look, it's vegas.
what happened in that room stays in that room.
okay.
Yeah, I get it. - Hey.
do you want to go to prom with me?
no, George! No.
I don't want to go prom with you.
what was that about?
she said she loved me.
Oh.
Oh! Hey.
I've been calling your cell all night.
um...
Oh, well, it's, uh...
it's a long story, which essentially ends with me inviting you to a prom.
an actual prom?
a corsages and tuxedoes-- - yeah, I know, it's stupid, but...
no, I'm in.
I loved prom.
I mean, I-I don't want to brag or anything, but I was crowned king.
Really?
you were that kid in high school?
what is wrong with being that kid? - Nothing.
it's very cute, actually.
hello. - Hi.
what are you doin' here?
doc had some seizures last night.
pretty serious.
the cancer has spread to his brain.
I'm sorry.
Hey. - Hey.
how's Preston?
he's recovering nicely.
I don't want to talk about it.
all right.
I mean, we've come so far.
you forgave me for Mark... - Mm-hmm.
and we're trying.
we are. - We're trying.
we are trying. - We're trying.
and--and I was jealous when there was no need to be.
right?
what?
will you go to the prom with me?
I went to college on a wrestling scholarship.
I played baseball, some basketball, but, you know, we'll go with football.
what the hell does football have to do with who cut the LVAD wires?
let's say you were drafted to a team that wasn't your first pick.
you know, you don't--you don't like the players, you hate the way they play the game, you even think the quarterback is full of crap.
the quarterback's a pain in the ass that you don't owe a damn thing to.
but... it's your team.
you don't quit, you don't talk to the press, you don't...
bitch to the coach.
you just...
you just go out there every sunday, and you make the blocks, and you take the hits, and you--you play to win.
you show up, and you suit up, and you play, because it's your freakin' team.
I know your type.
you're a surgical junkie.
Yes, sir.
I'm just saying, it's not gonna be easy for you to be away from the O. R. That long.
no, sir.
and if you want to get back to the O. R.
you're gonna tell me what I need to know, aren't you?
you're right.
it's not easy for me to be away from the O. R.
it's not easy for me to sit in front of you, or any other authority figure for that matter, and not be able to give you the exact answer you want to hear.
I'm the one with the answers.
I've always been the one with the answers.
but right now, sir,
I don't have any.
how do you keep your edge, sir?
because I watch you, and you've been doing this a long time, and--and you're clean.
you're focused, you are the job, nothing gets to you.
and the thing is, sir, is I was like that until I got here, until I actually started doing this job.
and now everything is...
is fuzzy or-- - that's beside the point.
no, see, sir?
this is the point.
because I can't tell you what happened in that room.
I can't tell you, and before,
I could have
no guilt, no loyalties, no problem.
before
before, I wouldn't have even been in that room.
I wouldn't have gotten involved,
I would have never frozen in surgery, and I would've told him what I thought he should do.
I had an edge, sir.
I had an edge, and I've lost it.
and I need it.
I need it back.
so...
if you could just tell me how you keep yours and how not to be affected...
I know I could be a great surgeon.
so if you could just give me the answers,
I would really appreciate it.
you're excused, Dr. Yang.
but-- - You're excused.
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you who cut the lvad wire, sir... - no, you won't.
if you could just please-- - I don't want to know, not from you.
Yeah, I have the answers, but I can't tell them to you.
I'm not gonna be responsible for you becoming less human.
I'm a pretty girl.
what?
I'm not being arrogant, it's just...
it's just kind of a fact.
for a long time, I made a career from my looks, so I get it
I'm a pretty girl.
and not in a "from "a certain angle" way, in an obvious way.
it's the blonde thing and the big boobs thing.
big boobs are key to obvious pretty, if you know what I'm saying.
Dr. Stevens
that's how men see me.
I'm not a smart girl or an interesting girl,
I'm a pretty girl.
the blonde and the boobs, it confuses guys into thinking that I'm someone else.
and I'm used to it.
I'm used to them walking away when they realize...
but then Denny goes and asks me to marry him.
is that why you cut the wires?
he doesn't make me feel like I'm a pretty girl.
he makes me feel like...
like me.
I think he might know me.
and so if I did cut the LVAD wire, and I'm not saying that I did, but if I did...
then, no,
I don't feel guilty.
and I know that I should, and I would if it were anybody else.
but I can't feel anything but happy.
aren't you gonna...
say anything or...
I'm not gonna break.
I'm starting to get a little freaked out, but I'm not gonna break.
it's not because I don't care, because I do care what you think about me,
I do...
care.
I just can't tell you what you want to hear...
which seems to be a theme in my life right now.
just because you can't say something doesn't mean you don't want to.
you can want to very much.
you can be with a person and be happy with them and not love them, or you can love someone and not want to be with them.
you don't need to.
love someone to want them.
Oh, it's frustrating.
you know, when your brain tells you what you want and what you actually want don't match up, it's exhausting.
and...
well, it's complicated.
but that's life.
and life...
sucks.
I've known you for a long time.
I know your mother and father.
and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you did not cut those lvad wires.
I need you tell me who did it.
I've been going over this and over this in my mind, trying to piece this together.
it was you.
you're the reason my parents broke up.
and it wasn't just an affair.
she really loved you.
it wasn't just this cheap thing where she didn't tell you she was married.
it wasn't all a lie.
she left her husband for you.
but you stayed with your wife because it was the right thing to do.
maybe safe, but she was the right person for you to be with.
and let's face it, my mother?
nothing wrong with being safe, being with the good guy because he's good.
and we are talking about forever here.
you've never regretted your decision.
you've never looked back.
right?
well, Finn thinks we should do it today, then.
good for finn.
can we just do this one thing together without arguing?
fine.
I think we may have to put him to sleep.
whatever you want to do.
what if there's a chance he can get better?
he's not gonna get better.
you know that.
well, finn thinks we should do it today, then.
what did I tell you?
visiting hours aren't for another hour.
you are no longer his doctor.
you want to see Denny, you come back when the visitors come.
I would, but I can't wait.
ixnay on the insubordination-ay but it's my turn.
if the chief finds out you were even on this floor
hold on.
it's her turn.
Yes.
my answer is yes.
Oh, now, see?
you're gonna make my heart stop beating, and it's brand-new.
I will call security on you.
okay. I will come back during visiting hours.
and it's prom, so I'll show you my dress.
okay.
I'm going.
you did good.
I tricked her into marrying me.
how smart am I?
we're throwing a prom.
the chief's making us throw a prom.
O'malley mentioned.
george came to see you?
he's my friend.
Oh.
I won't bear a grudge.
what did you...
I have to take care of me.
I don't expect you to take care of me, but I have to take care of me.
and if this...
if you can't stay here for this...
I won't bear a grudge.
are you gonna tell shepherd about...
not yet.
I'm, uh...
not yet.
okay, there's a couple of forms you need to sign.
I only need one signature.
well, you
it's fine.
here, I'll sign.
so how do we do this?
well, I'll give Doc an injection of thole to make him sleepy, and then I'll give him an I. V.
injection of phenobarbital.
and that'll stop his heart.
Yes.
and what do we do after, with his body?
we can...
we have the means to dispose of it for you.
that's fine. Go ahead.
we can't throw him away like he's garbage.
we would never
he's our dog, Derek.
there's that, uh, clearing by the trailer.
Overlookinthe water.
we can, uh, bury him there.
that sounds nice.
you ready? - Yeah.
I'm so sorry, Doc.
I'm sorry, too.
that's the hospital.
I gotta go. - Okay.
I'll begin.
Shh.
it's okay.
it's okay.
it's okay.
it's okay.
he's gone.
no, I have to go home and change.
I'll see you later, okay?
I'm sorry... for your loss.
Yeah.
you know, the thing is, he wasn't really my dog for that long.
he was more Derek's dog.
he was a good dog.
he was.
Oh, I'm too tired for this.
Where's your husband, Dr. Bailey?
uh, at home with the baby.
thought you'd at least get to get outta this.
Why?
well, with burke upstairs...
what happened to him,
I'm sure the chief would've let you out yeah.
Hey. - Hey.
have you seen Meredith?
I don't think she's here yet.
this whole thing is bringing back very traumatic memories of being a band geek with braces and a lisp and spending the whole evening with skippy gold talking about "star wars.
so, you want to, um, dance?
love to.
can I cut in?
what did you say to my boyfriend to make him that scared of you?
I'm a frightening man, Cammie.
no, you're not.
where brian's concerned, yes, I am.
be kind to him.
he loves me.
I've been loved.
and that's something everyone should have once in their life.
I've been loved.
thank you for the prom, uncle Richard.
you're welcome.
Hey, I was looking for
where are you going?
I'm wearing a dress,
I have on heels,
I shaved my legs
I'm going to the prom.
you said that you didn't want to go.
no, I said I didn't want to go with you.
I said "I love you."
I said it.
I said it out loud to your face, and ever since, you
I have never said that to a guy before, never.
and now I am just this idiot who says I love you and then gets avoided.
no, I'm not avoiding you.
I promise.
you gonna say it back?
no.
I'm humiliated.
no, george, let me go.
George, leme go.
let me go.
stop fighting me.
if I say it back right now, you know I'm just sayin' it because you said it to me.
when I
when I say I love you,
I want to mean it because...
you just have to give me some time to mean it.
I hate that I'm so into you.
you're a lot hotter than my last prom date.
is that a compliment?
maybe.
it feels like a compliment.
then it is.
well, keep it up.
you might get lucky.
well, now how lucky are we talking?
are we talking kinda lucky, or are we talking really seriously lucky?
you have been a very patient man, and I appreciate it.
what?
Liz was my wife
and when she died...
you get this thing, you know, where you stop making plans.
because you had plans, but then there's a car crash and your plans disappeared.
so you just...
I just try and get from sunup to sundown.
that's as far into the future as I can handle.
and I've been fine with that.
I have.
but right now, looking at you...
damn, I-I have all kinds of plans.
don't--don't freak out.
I'm not.
you're not?
no.
you have plans.
I have plans.
you all right?
Yeah, it's just, uh, hot and... claustrophobic.
you know what?
there's a patient i've gotta go check on.
I think I'm just gonna run and splash some cold water on my face.
I'll be right back, okay?
I'll be right back, okay?
okay. - All right.
leave me alone.
just leave me alone.
I just wanted to make sure you were all rig.
No! I'm not all right. Okay?
are you satisfied?
I'm not all right, because you have a wife, and you call me a whore, and our dog died.
and now you're looking at me.
stop looking at me. - I'm not looking at you.
I am not looking at you.
you are looking at me, and you watch me.
and Finn has plans.
and I like Finn, he's perfect for me, and I'm really trying here to be happy.
and I can't breathe.
I can't breathe with you looking at me like that, so just stop!
do you think I want to look at you?
that I wouldn't rather be looking at my wife?
I'm married.
I have responsibilities.
she doesn't drive me crazy, she doesn't make it impossible for me to feel normal, she doesn't make me sick to my stomach thinking about my veterinarian touching her with his hands!
Oh, man, I would give anything not to be looking at you.
whoa. You look nice.
thank you. So do you.
hot date?
Nah. This thing is cheesy.
I wouldn't waste a decent chick on this.
you headin' in?
Yeah, I'm just gonna see denny first.
Oh, okay.
what does this mean?
uh, I had panties on.
black.
do you see them?
Meredith, what does this mean?
help me look for them.
and fix your tie. - Meredith...
what does this mean?
Oh, the nurse told me to come find you.
you have to come now. It's Izzie.
wait, wait, wait.
okay, go.
chief.
I did my internship here, my residency, came back here the minute my fellowship was done.
the day they told me i would be chief,
I was standing right there in that O. R.
spent my whole career in this hospital.
my whole life.
sir...
Denny Duquette died at 7: 42 this evening.
damn it.
what happened?
I didn't know what to do.
I-I didn't think you guys would want me to go to the chief
where is she?
she's in there with him.
I think it was a stroke.
he was prone to blood clots.
a clot could have formed on his sutures, traveled to his brain.
it only takes a second.
Dr. Hahn did a beautiful job on the surgery.
but I don't know why I didn't think of blood clots.
he died all alone.
he was alone.
there was nothing you could've done.
I changed my dress three times.
I wanted to look nice.
I would've been here sooner...
but I couldn't figure out which dress to wear.
we shouldn't be in here.
Iizzie, there are things that they need
they need to move him.
take him to the morgue.
you can't stay here.
I know you want to...
can you please, please just get out?
I want to be alone with Denny.
Izzie, that's not Denny.
shut up.
that's not Denny.
the minute his heart stopped beating, he stopped being Denny.
now I know you love him, but he also loved you.
and a guy that loves you like that, he doesn't want you to do this to yourself.
because it's not Denny, not anymore.
an hour ago, he was proposing.
and now...
and now he's going to the morgue.
isn't that ridiculous?
isn't at the most ridiculous piece of crap you've ever heard?
come on.
I'm sorry.
these are ridic--Hey.
Hi. - Derek, where have you been?
uh, I was with a patient. - Shepherd.
yes?
have you seen Bailey's interns
I'm looking for Izzie stevens in particular.
no, I haven't. No.
chief.
it was me.
I cut his LVAD wire.
I did it. No one helped me.
and now...
I thought i was a surgeon, but...
I can't.
I thought I was a surgeon, but I am not.
so I quit.
well, I guess that...
puts an end to the evening. - Yeah.
Yeah, I guess it does.
come on. I'll drive you home.
I'm getting married to burke.
Ouch.
I went to the board this morning and told them I was retiring.
one of us could be chief.
we were here long before you and george started fooling around.
he is my husband. - Stop saying that like it means something.
Jane Doe, about six months pregnant. Found under a pile of rubble.
she can't remember anything from before the accident.
go 60 days with no sex, no other women.
my mother's dead, isn't she? - Yes.
why didn't you stay and fight for us?
I - I tried.
Alex, I'm sorry. I can't.
people have scars in all sorts of unexpected places, like secret road maps of their personal histories, diagrams of all their old wounds.
Alex! God.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Seen it all before.
what the hell are you doing here?
moving in. - What?
most of our old wounds heal, leaving nothing behind but a scar.
but some of them don't.
Alex is moving in? To this house?
he's taking george's room. - Why?
I was asleep just a minute ago.
Yeah. And I was naked in the bathroom when alex walked in.
I'm lucky I didn't come out of the shower to find him peeing all over the seat.
and we're up.
what's wrong with where he was living before?
I don't know where he was living before. - Probably a whorehouse.
I can't have him living in the room right next door. It's weird.
people are what matters.
Alex is one of our people. We can't leave him out in the cold.
"people are what matters"? You don't like people.
is this about your mother? - No.
I had a near death whatever, and...
I was dead. And now I'm not.
so I'd like to use this chance I've been given to be more positive.
people are what matters.
paint with all the colors of the wind.
Oh. Okay.
you're crazy now.
I'm alive. - Yeah, okay.
no, no. Um, I'm not done in there yet.
Oh, don't worry. Not looking, not interested.
some wounds we carry with us everywhere, and though the cut's long gone...
no, she's selfish, is Izzie's problem.
the pain still lingers.
she's not selfish. She's generous. But...
she - she's self-absorbed.
I mean, her problem is that she doesn't see other people's perspectives.
Hey, give me a bite.
you know, it's weird because she's so ridiculously compassionate with her patients.
you'd think she'd roll some of that out for her friends, - how about we not talk about her anymore? - But not the way
that's a fine idea.
he is in George's room, and when George's stupid marriage crashes and burns, he's gonna want to move back in, and he won't be able to.
his life will be in a shambles, he'll finally notice that his dad is dead and he made a fool out of himself by marrying somebody he doesn't really love, and he'll have no place to go. Is that what you want?
that's exactly what I want.
Hey, look who found some clothes. - Shut it.
how you doing?
okay, everybody, let's do this once.
I'm fine, she's cremated, I picked out a beautiful urn, and she's hanging out in the back of my closet.
any more questions about my dead mother, or can we get back to work?
does anyone know who the new chief candidate is?
the chief's bringing in a ringer in case he doesn't want to give the job to either of your boyfriends.
O'malley, you're with shepherd today.
yang, Dr. Montgomery. Stevens, to the clinic.
Karev, Jane Doe. Grey, scut.
once again, I am fine.
you can tell everybody you fine till you're blue in your face.
your mom died, and you almost joined her.
you're taking it easy.
anybody come looking for me yet?
well, no match on your prints, no. No hits from missing persons, plus
my face is hard to identify.
well, the second they find something out about your identity, I'm gonna come tell you.
Dr. Sloan says I need surgery on my eye.
well, he just wants to make sure you don't lose vision there completely.
but Dr. Montgomery says I should wait a day or two 'cause of the baby.
I don't know what I'm supposed to make of that.
Yeah, well, I mean, surgery can be hard on a baby, but you're gonna be on a fetal monitor the whole time, so if anything goes wrong, we'll catch it.
thank you.
I really - I really appreciate you taking the time to...
I mean, you're - you're all I've got in this place.
does that hurt?
of course it hurts. Don't poke it like that.
has the lump been there a long time?
I got shot 50 years ago. It's been there a long time.
but it hasn't bothered you till... recently?
it bothers me there's a bullet in there.
it'd bother you, too, but it didn't start hurting till a couple of months ago.
you think it's a bullet?
I don't "think," lady. I know.
I wanted it out, but the army doctors didn't want to go get it.
so they let me keep it in for half a lifetime.
well...
let's get some pictures, see if you're right.
I know I'm right. Save your film.
just get me something for the pain.
Mr. Scofield, I'm sure you are right, but we're still gonna do this my way.
Derek. - There she is.
how was your flight?
they didn't feed me, which I don't understand.
Dr. O'malley, Dr. Crawford. She's a big pain in the ass.
pleasure. - He says that because we worked together in new york, and I was the only one who never had a crush on him.
no, I - I don't buy that.
what do we know, O'malley?
Dr. Crawford has a parafalcine meningioma along the superior sagittal sinus.
you've operated three times. It keeps on coming back.
Yeah, it's in dangerous territory, so we leave a little bit of the tumor behind each time, and we go back every couple of years and, uh, tune it up.
but this is the last time.
sorry? - This is it, Derek.
I'm done after this.
the recovery takes forever, and it's not like when Jake was around.
I go through this by myself now.
don't throw in the towel.
I'm looking at the situation as it is.
I am going to do this now, then I am going to spend the next two years of my life lying on a beach, enjoying the sun.
Helen... - stop looking at me like I killed your cat.
the decision is made.
you guys seen Bailey?
what are we doing? - checking out the new chief candidate.
chief's in with the ringer. We're lurking in a way that was subtle when it was two of us, - but isn't now that it's 12. - I heard it was someone from stanford.
all the professors there loved me.
they loved you? - I was a great student.
how you doing, Grey? - Oh, I'm fine, sir. Thank you.
move, move, move. - She doesn't like it when people ask.
the ringer's in there with the chief.
Yeah, and whoever it is loves Cristina because everyone at stanford just loved Cristina.
shut up. - She's a motivated student.
that's nothing to be ashamed of. - Thank you.
a bit of a kiss ass, but that's hard to control.
Oh, they're coming out. Look away.
that's Colin Marlowe.
like the Marlowe transplant?
like the brightest thing in cardiothoracic surgery in a generation.
uh, Dr. Marlowe...
I'm, uh, Preston Burke. I'm a great admirer of your work, sir.
uh, particularly the - yes, thank you. I
would you excuse me for just a second?
well...
you gonna give me a hug or what?
so what was that, exactly?
he was my professor. We were close.
well, "close" appears to be something of an understatement.
it was a long time ago.
I talk about him all the time. You never thought to mention it?
well, um, I didn't think you wanted to hear about every guy I ever slept with.
I have a hysterectomy to prep.
are we done with the curiosity?
great.
what are you doing tonight?
cause I don't want to go home and find Alex there, and it's just the two of us, you know?
and it's weird and awkward, and he doesn't know whether he should talk to me or not talk to me.
it's just such an awkward situation.
I'd rather it be group awkwardness, you know?
I don't want to just be standing there staring at him.
Hey, have you seen montgomery? - No.
Hey! What are you doing tonight? You want to come over?
cause you and I never really get a chance to hang out and...
it might be kind of fun. Alex just moved in, which was Meredith's brilliant idea.
this is my hiding spot. My father is out there. Go somewhere else.
I Meed this closet, Meredith. - Colin Marlowe?
Yes, he was my professor. We were close.
he had his hand on your ass. I sure hope you were close.
did you see somebody go in there?
I did. Someone's hiding from me.
Yes, I think someone's hiding from me, too.
you were that girl, huh? The girl who slept with the professor.
we had one in my class. She only got to the radiologist, though.
no one got near the cardio god.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I scored big. You know, hide in the bathroom.
my awkwardness with my father is well-established.
you and the cardio god, on the other hand, have loads to catch up on.
but I don't want to talk to the cardio god.
you know we can hear you in there, right? Loud and clear.
Oh. Hi.
Hi.
excuse me. May I? - Yeah.
Oh, I was just leaving, actually. - We heard about your mother.
I'm so sorry. - Thank you.
there wasn't a funeral or anything?
Oh, she didn't want that.
I hope everything's okay with the baby.
Oh, we're not here with the baby. We're here because we wanted to make sure that you were all right.
Oh, well, that's sweet, but we don't have to do this. I'm not in shock.
I'm not racked with grief. I'm just moving on.
but you're hiding in a broom closet.
well, if you could just move my father...
I sent him to go get some coffee, but we'd really like to...
you know, make dinner or something... for you.
he's been really worried about you.
and he's the family you have left, Meredith.
I - I don't see it that way.
Oh, when is this gonna stop?
Yes, he made some mistakes, but he's not a monster.
he's just...
an inarticulate person who spills food on his shirt, a lot.
have dinner with us, tonight.
I'll make some chili. The whole thing will be over in an hour.
you think you can do that?
I can't believe you hid in a closet when you saw me coming.
if it wasn't just tragic, it might be the most adorable thing I've ever seen.
you could've warned me.
I thought, Cristina Yang wouldn't hide in a closet 'cause she doesn't want to talk to me, which clearly she doesn't because she fled like a roach in sunlight when she saw me coming.
you know, I did not flee. I was - I have work to do.
I'm not a professional note taker anymore.
you grew your hair. It's lovely.
don't flirt with me. I have a person.
Really? Who?
you never change. Must be adorable.
no. Shut up. It is a real relationship.
I bet it is. - I'm marrying him.
Oh...
good.
Congratulations.
no, I'm being genuine.
it's wonderful.
can I give you a congratulatory hug?
don't touch my ass.
my stomach is growling.
sorry. We can't let you eat before the surgery.
that's okay. I stayed at the archfield last night.
I had them make me breakfast at midnight.
you should try the french toast. It'll blow your mind.
breakfast at the archfield on an intern's salary?
Yeah, I kinda live there at the moment. My wife has a deal there.
that's one hell of a deal.
so our room service bill at the archfield, is that part of the deal?
Yeah, sure.
I mean, breakfast alone is, what, probably 50 bucks a day?
and they still only charge us $400 a week?
sometimes I pay them more for room service.
okay. Well, then just tell me how much it is, and we'll split it like we do the rest.
don't worry about it, George. - No, come on.
I'm not gonna have you pay for all the food. Just tell me how much the room service bill is.
we pay about, mm, 800 a week.
dollars? I told you not to worry about it.
you can't afford that. - Yes, I can.
how?
I'm your husband now. You're supposed to tell me this stuff.
okay. Just come here.
all right, my parents have a lot of money...
what? - And so I...
have more money than I'm making.
and we don't have a special deal through family friends at the archfield.
I just - I pay for it. - How much?
$2, 500 a week.
you're an heiress. - Okay.
see, this is why I don't tell people. - You're an heiress.
no, stop talking. - You're an heiress?
don't - just don't, okay? Stop talking. Stop talking. I mean it.
I - I didn't tell you because my parents' money has affected every single relationship in my life, and so I've stopped talking about it and living it
no, wait, wait. So wait. So I've been
I've been paying you $200 a week for what, fun?
no. I use it to tip housekeeping.
great! Oh!
Oh, I'm - you know, I'm glad I could pitch in.
you know, is there anything else that I should know about that's, I don't know, huge like this?
uh, I - I - I used to have a pet ferret for nine years.
George... great.
stop distracting the staff.
you're pushy. Anybody ever tell you that?
um, so what do you think of a sagittal sinus bypass?
have you ever scrubbed in on a sagittal sinus bypass, Dr. O'malley?
no.
it is what they call "big balls" surgery.
apparently I have a surgeon with - it's been very successful.
when the patient doesn't stroke out.
if it works, the tumor's all gone. We never have to go back in there again.
if it doesn't work, I'm dead. - If you refuse to come back in two years, you're dead anyway.
that's a decision I can live with. - That isn't a decision I can live with.
O'malley, go find her labs.
so what do you think, huh?
a few years on a beach, and then what?
after you piss away your savings, your memory goes, motor skills deteriorate, and you're dying a very slow, - miserable, painful death... - Derek
you're gonna call me up and you're gonna ask me why we didn't do something when we had the chance.
now that is not something I can live with, not when we can do something right now to prevent it.
well, it looks like the bullet has damaged your scapula.
no wonder it hurts.
how did you get shot, sir?
korea. Garden spot. Makes a nice vacation.
can I get a damn painkiller?
I think we'll do you one better. We're gonna take it out.
my bullet?
there was no reason to remove it when you first got hit, but now it's infected.
it's working its way into your scapula, and we can't have that.
I need to see that bullet. - You gonna frame it?
no, smarty-pants. I was fragged a couple of weeks before it all ended.
Fragged? - Yeah, shot by one of his own men.
I made a decision, and they didn't like it. And then what do you know?
we're facing enemy fire, and I take a hit from the wrong side of the line.
I could never prove it, but we can prove it now when you pull the damn thing out of me.
get me my bullet. - Let's calm down, Mr. Scofield.
do you know what it's like when your own men turn on you?
it's not a good feeling.
I just agreed to have dinner at my father's house, tonight.
and Cristina slept with Colin Marlowe.
"Marlowe transplant" Marlowe?
they had a thing when she was a student. How could I have a meal at my father's house?
he slept with Cristina? - Derek.
Oh, right. Sorry. Okay.
um, have dinner at your house.
it's your place. I'll come.
I'll be your wingman. It'll be fun.
okay, it won't be fun. But it'll be...it'll be fine.
they're your family. - Why does everyone assume that?
you deserve to have a family, whether you like them or not.
I thought we had a deal.
we agreed I wouldn't sleep with anybody for two months. We never said I wouldn't look.
you didn't think I'd hold out. - No, I didn't.
you're worth it. - You bet your ass I am.
she's rich, totally rich, boatloads of money.
George, that's fantastic. - No, it's...
it's not fantastic.
Cristina did Colin Marlowe.
Callie's rich.
don't talk to her about it. - "Her"?
I'm sorry, I don't have a name anymore. - "Don't tell anyone." Those were my words.
so - so she's rich. - Just shut up about it.
do you think that's possible?
if you give me the "people is what matters" thing again, I will kill you.
was it good? Was he good?
did he make you a better lover?
remember all the other times I've talked to you about my sex life?
no. Exactly.
did I miss anything about her doing the old guy?
she's not talking. - Oh, she'll talk.
so I was supposed to be back in the game today, but instead I'm planning dinner for my father in my dead mother's house.
I don't cook. How am I supposed to cook for them?
I will make your stupid dinner.
so were there any little blue pills involved, or is he untouched by time?
dude, that's just wrong. Don't answer that.
so if it's, uh, unbearable, you can abort.
Oh, thank you.
come on. He's not a young man.
he wasn't getting a little help?
poppin' the pill? Dad's best friend?
come on. You're gonna give me nothing after everything we've been through?
nothing?
it's a miracle drug.
and someday, it'll save your life.
Ah, Dr. Marlowe? Rek Shepherd.
I'm doing a sagittal sinuspass today if you'd like to observe.
Really? That's quite a procedure.
well, it's a good trick, but if you're really interested to see what this hospital can do,
I'm performing an arterial switch operation for a T.G.A. this afternoon.
if you gentlemen are trying to intimidate the competition, it's working.
good.
I'll see both of you in surgery.
the one and only.
he... - yes.
with... - yes.
Wow. - Indeed.
Yeah.
suction.
no, not like you're driving a tractor.
slowly.
better.
what's the chance she wakes up and remembers everything?
I wouldn't count on it.
Dr. Sloan, the baby's having decels.
are you sure? Sometimes the monitor's not on right.
you get a false read.
she's got vaginal bleeding. The baby's in distress.
Oh, damn it. - Page Dr. Montgomery.
now!
you're making an honest woman of cristina yang.
that's
that's impressive.
I always thought she was collecting us, like baseball cards.
baseball cards?
well, she likes an authority figure, someone with something to teach her.
but I never thought she would actually commit.
she use to say to me that she thought that marriage was for the weak and undirected.
I made a number of marriage proposals.
it seemed the polite thing to do after such a long time together, but, uh, she wouldn't have it.
all what time?
you were just having a fling with a student.
a fling?
Cristina and I were together for three years.
is the problem that I slept with my professor, or that I was committed enough to keep at it for three years?
Oh, no. You told him that you thought marriage was an idiotic institution.
it is. - Then why did you say yes?
because I want to make you happy. - "Happy"?
you know, I'll do a lot of things to make you happy.
do I give a crap about a ceremony with a dress and a flautist?
no.
but I'm happy to do it if it'll make you happy.
heartwarming.
Thanks.
you couldn't have waited one day?
she was 40% vision compromised in her right eye. It would've been gone tomorrow.
no, it wouldn't, actually, but there's a snazzy new chief candidate marching around the hall today, and you needed to be a hero. That's what needed to happen today.
the patient was fine, addison.
the baby's still in her uterus, and she's not losing an eye.
every surgery is risky.
the patient chose this one.
Karev... don't just stand there.
the patient's baby was in distress.
go. Stay with her.
something happen with Jane Doe?
Yeah, she can see, and Addison's got a problem with it.
he rushed her into surgery, and she almost lost the baby.
I had to sew her cervix shut.
the complications had nothing to do with the surgery.
and why? Why do you think mark moved so quickly, Derek?
do you think it's because a piece of the orbital bone was floating towards the brain?
well, I think it's because mark wants a promotion.
you're not her husband. This isn't your patient.
stay out of it!
what the hell do you people think you're doing?
you're supposed to be the leadership of this hospital.
screaming about a patient in the hallway?
are you out of your minds?
tough procedure. - Mm-hmm.
it's a bold choice.
we've been fighting this one for a while.
I'm hoping this will be the end of it.
what happened?
end-tidal c0-2 just dropped from 30 to 16. Bagging manually.
Doppler's showing air in the left ventricle.
O2 stat's down to 89.
aspirate the central line.
she's bradycardic. - Push 1 of atropine.
there's no air in the central line.
all right, level her out. I'm gonna flood the field.
asystole. Push 1 milligram of EPI.
start compressions. Go.
get in there. Get in there! Do it!
that things been in there since the korean war?
he's lucky it didn't travel down to his aorta.
okay, a little suction there.
almost...
I got it.
make sure we get that back. The patient wants it.
he's got a warped sense of nostalgia.
hmm, I get it.
if they pulled a bullet out of me, I'd want it cast in gold and mounted on my wall.
Yeah, well, you can afford it.
just a little more suction. Let's get ready to close.
she's not responding.
I'm gonna open her up. - Open cardiac massage?
you're a neurosurgeon.
you have no privileges in this hospital. Get the glasses off.
should we page Dr. Burke? - No, I've got it.
cross clamp the hilum. You don't want air in the cerebral arteries.
Yeah, I got it. Give me a 10-blade.
10-blade quickly, please. O'malley, get over here.
let's roll her. Ready? One, two, three. Go.
okay, rib spreader.
okay, scissors.
massage her heart, O'malley.
I need to aspirate.
any air return?
end-tidal c0-2 is going back up.
the heart's starting to beat on its own.
pressure's 60 over 40. It's low, but it's there.
she's gonna make it.
should I start closing her up?
Dr. Shepherd?
O'malley, I just sliced my friend's chest open. Give me a moment.
that was very well-handled, Dr. Shepherd.
very impressive, indeed.
not something I want to do every day, but thank you.
what happened?
Dr. Shepherd's patient had a venous air embolism.
he had to split her chest open, massage her heart and manually aspirate right in the middle of his procedure.
why didn't you call me?
uh, you were operating. - I was next door. You could've pulled me out.
there was no time. I handled it.
you think I crack people's heads open if you're in the building - just because I think I can handle a brain bleed? - The patient is fine.
the patient is lucky, and you were showboating. - Showboating?
what, are you out of your mind? I was
we seem to be going out of our way to impress Dr. Marlowe.
I'll bet we are. - Gentlemen...
good day, doctors.
how you feeling, Mr. Scofield?
Where's my bullet?
that it?
Where's the rest of it?
that was it.
is that a letter?
can you read that?
I - I don't think it's much of anything. I - I think it's just a scratch.
it's so small.
it could just be anything.
it's been a long time.
they don't hold up that well.
could you have your lab, you know, analyze it?
tell me if it's one of ours or
we're not set up for that kind of investigation, Mr. Scofield.
you could try to send it to a forensic lab, but I don't know if they'll tell you much either.
I've been stewing for 50 years.
maybe it's time to move on.
to what?
I lost my whole unit over this.
I came home.
my wife, she didn't get it.
I've been blazing mad my whole life.
I got nothing left.
it's not too late to let it go and start over.
you're a sweet kid, but you don't know what it's like to have something change you in your soul.
I do.
I wish I didn't, but I do.
don't let it turn you.
you look like you had a long day.
you know what fragging is?
we've got an epidemic of it today.
my esteemed attendings are gonna be the death of me.
is there a front-runner?
I don't know.
what I do know is I don't want my attendings tearing each other's throats out because of some internal power struggle.
it's too dangerous for the hospital.
does that mean...
is colin marlowe gonna be the new chief?
good night, Dr. Bailey.
this is ready.
don't slosh it around. It's all about the presentation.
come in and eat with us.
you need to bond with your people, meredith.
people are what matters.
I hate people. - Yeah, well, do your own talking.
we talked.
we talked hospital, we talked his research, we talked dead mother.
I'm out. - Ask about the baby.
ask if it poos. People can go on about that for hours.
Oh, the chicken looks delicious. - Yeah.
it's from the store.
well, the green beans look great as well.
I... didn't do those either.
it's beautifully presented.
Izzie did that.
come, sit.
Oh. no, go ahead.
eat. We're eating.
this is Susan, and this is my father.
Hi.
here, you can have this plate. - Cool.
okay.
so how are you? How was your day?
okay. Hungry.
good.
how's the baby?
great. - She's smiling now...sometimes.
she looks exactly like Molly wh-when she smiles.
I mean, it's amazing. I've got this old picture of Molly and me when Molly was... I don't know, 5, and she's sitting on this red sled in the snow, this great, big fir tree...
you know, I'm not sure that that - yeah.
no, honey, it's a massive douglas fir.
and in the picture, couldn't look more like the baby.
I mean, incredible. - That's me.
the red sled and the big fir tree in the park at the middle school in the ugly, yellow, plaid wool coat.
that isn't Molly.
it's you and me.
Oh, great. - crap.
sorry. I think I blew a fuse.
I'll get it. - No, you know, I could get it.
it's - oh, in the laundry room.
I keep forgetting. - What?
it's his house.
I'm going home.
are you going home?
how did it end?
it ended. School was ending, I was leaving.
you were done.
I came here. I fell in love with you.
a new mentor with a host of new things to teach you.
if you think that I'm in this for the education
do you or do you not find my knowledge and my skill compelling?
Oh, god. You know what? You are blowing this way out of
a man three times your age believed that he was having a substantial relationship with you...
well, yeah, he was.
and one day, you're done, just like that?
Yes.
you don't open yourself up... to anyone.
sometimes... I think it's charming
she's different, she's not like other women.
but the simple fact is - is that you have never let me in.
what, you think that it's gonna make a good marriage?
well, I don't.
I don't want you to marry me because you're placating me.
that doesn't interest me.
it doesn't interest me at all.
do you think he's okay? - He'll find it.
he probably can't see. Um, there's a flashlight in the closet.
I'll go get it. - Thanks.
excuse me.
I'm sorry. - It's going fine.
I just...
I don't know what to say to him.
well, it's not easy.
that's 'cause he's afraid of you.
I shouldn't have bit his head off.
I wish I could've just...
Meredith, it's okay to get angry.
it's you in the picture.
I share something with you that I clearly feel uncomfortable about, and you tell Izzie Stevens?
no, I didn't tell Izzie. I told Meredith. Meredith told
Oh! Oh, so that's better?
no, it was an accident.
it was an accident.
I was pissed off
why can't you give me the benefit of the doubt that
that maybe sometimes I'm on your side?
because you choose your friends over me - every chance you get. - No, I don't.
I married you, and I haven't talked to my best friend in weeks.
meanwhile you lied to me about where we live and why.
you lied to me about your background.
you lied to me about your family!
and still I'm the dog who gets whacked on the nose with a newspaper all the time.
when is this gonna stop?
Oh, so this is my problem? - Yeah, maybe it is.
Oh, oh, so the fact that your best friend violently disses our marriage every chance she gets, publicly, repeatedly...
why do you think she does that George? Have you ever thought about that?
she's having a problem with this. I understand that.
she has feelings for you.
what? - She wants you.
she wants you. That's what this is about.
that's why she hates me.
George, George, do not laugh at me. Do not laugh at me.
no. no, I'm not. I'm not.
Oh, god.
I'm not.
it's just, come on, she's Izzie. She's
she's bl - she's blonde, she's stacked, she's
she's a supermodel. I'm George.
so what does that make me? - No.
no, come on. You are gorgeous...
and you're curvy, and I never thought you'd go for me.
just shut up. - Callie
this is my hotel room that I pay for with my huge piles of money.
get the hell out of it!
I'm sorry about the lights.
eh, whatever. The food was good.
you want some pie? - Nah, I gotta go.
Oh, big plans. Got a hot date?
Oh.
well, good for you.
I guess "not interested" really meant not interested.
you didn't want me. - Yeah.
but that doesn't mean I want you to want anyone else.
am I gonna be alone, pining over a dead guy forever?
I hope not. It's kind of a waste.
am I supposed to move on now?
do people look at me and go, "she's gotta get over it already. It's ruining her life"?
you'll move on when you're ready to.
why are you sitting in the dark?
Izzie blew a fuse. - Okay, I'm having a crisis.
Oh, I don't need rescuing.
Susan is very nice, and we're getting through it.
limping through, but we'll make it.
okay, no, this isn't a fake crisis.
this is a real, "my ex is about to ruin my impending marriage" crisis.
Oh.
Hey. Hey. Where's Izzie?
kitchen.
sorry. It's not always like this.
Yeah, it-- it kinda is.
they're in the other room.
I need you to get over yourself.
I need you to start liking my wife.
I need you to like her because sometimes I don't, and I need you to talk me back into it.
you say you're my friend? That's the job.
okay.
I need to vent, and I need it to be okay.
okay.
and I need to vent with alcohol.
I got married, and I'm scared it was a bad idea.
nobody ever got married and didn't think that at least once.
did you find the fuse box?
Yeah. Yeah, I just needed to...
take a break? - I don't know how to
or what to talk to her about.
work's a good place to start.
you know, she's proud of what she does.
she's good at it, too.
I'd start with that.
you get each other. That's nice.
some days it's nice.
some days I'd like to come home to someone who doesn't know a thing about it.
rough day?
I almost lost a friend in my own O.R.
was it your fault?
I don't know.
you were both nervous tonight.
it'll get easier. - She was nervous?
Yeah.
she's tough.
she tries to hide it. She's difficult.
but if you make an effort, she's worth it.
you okay?
not entirely.
she's worth the effort.
all right.
Ah, nice.
damn it.
gotta go back in, huh? - Yeah.
why is there an 11-inch incision in my chest?
you coded on the table - air embolus.
I had to open you up and aspirate.
see, I'm sure you did a great job, but that's why you're gonna have some real trouble convincing me to do it again.
Helen... we got it all.
the tumor - we never have to go back in there again.
you're sure? - I'm sure.
you're gonna live a long, long life.
and here I thought you were just being an ass.
Ah, I was an ass.
I had no right to push you like that.
no, you did not.
I was going through some stuff, and I just
I... I was an ass.
okay.
but in this moment, you're the ass who gave me my life back.
I'm so glad we did this.
I am, too. Thank you for suggesting it. Because I
you never would have in a million years.
good night, sweetie. - Thank you. Good night.
I'm-- I'm sorry a-about your mother.
thank you. - Thanks.
swing's still here.
Yes, it, uh, doesn't swing. Nobody uses it.
I put this in there. You used to catch your fingers in it.
suck it up, go back with your tail between your legs and just apologize.
No! - No, really. Look, you just
I'm always apologizing. - "I'm sorry. I'm an ass." Blah.
and it's over. And then it's all over.
no. Not real - I can't be wrong all the time.
is that really possible?
don't - don't finish it.
Hey, don't be grabby. - You -I don't have any.
bogie.
maybe you're wrong all the time, maybe she's just really insecure.
it doesn't matter. You still have to grovel.
don't you - fill...
Yeah, um, she's...
she's insecure. - Yeah.
that is a fact.
she's insecure.
what?
what? just tell me.
come on. - No.
come on!
shut up.
no, it's, um, ju - nothing.
just that she thinks you have feelings for me, like that's the problem.
I love that. That's fabulous.
no, and--and--and... - oh, I need a tissue.
that, uh, I - I - I desperately want you.
I'm crying. I'm crying.
is she crazy?
you know, I think - I think she's maybe a little crazy.
Oh, can't breathe. - Shut up.
I can't breathe.
we gotta be quiet.
Ow.
scary day, huh? - Yeah.
well, your amniotic sac's intact, the placenta's in good position.
Dr. Montgomery sewed your cervix up so tight, nothing's coming outta there.
so the baby's gonna be okay?
we're gonna have to see how it goes.
I'm sorry.
you asked me what I thought, and I told you to go for it, and I'm...
I'm really sorry. - It's not your fault.
no, see, when I pulled you out of that water at the ferry, I...
you're...
I talked to you like you were my sister, and I shouldn't have.
I'm an intern.
you gotta get your medical advice from an attending.
I asked you 'cause I trust you.
why don't you sit and tell me a bedtime story or something?
what's worse, new wounds, which are so horribly painful...
move over. You're in the middle of the bed.
or old wounds that should've healed years ago and never did?
am I gonna screw up this engagement?
I don't know. Do you want to?
I don't know.
my mom is dead.
Yeah, she is.
maybe our old wounds teach us something.
they remind us of where we've been and what we've overcome.
they teach us lessons about what to avoid in the future.
that's what we like to think.
but that's not the way it is, is it?
some things we just have to learn over and over and over again.
you're gonna transfer to Mercy West? - I have to.
give me my husband back.
chief resident? - The one fifth year resident that rules all residents.
your intern exams are in two weeks.
you need to spend every available minute studying for them.
what happened to our small ceremony?
what happened you and me at City Hall?
there's no guarantee the surgery's gonna bring back your memory.
is there a man in my house? - I'm so sorry, Richard.
and I'm finally ready to have a baby, and I can't.
we're losing her pulse. She's coding!
we did everything we could.
a surgeon's education never ends.
every patient, every symptom, every operation...
is a test, a chance for us to demonstrate how much we know...
and how much more we have to learn.
how do you treat pancreatic divisum? Izzie? - Oh, Cristina.
if you're not gonna let us sleep, you at least have to let me put coffee in my cup.
okay, so go. No one's stopping you. - I'm too tired to go.
pancreatic divisum.
dorsal duct sphincterotomy. - Not your turn, but correct. You do me.
I can't believe O'malley's missing this. How's he gonna be ready?
Oh, you're kidding, right?
we have Callie's cards, but George has- - George has Callie.
what's the most frequent cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients?
is she coming to this bachelorette thing tonight?
rotavirus. Yes. Uh, no! No, no, no. Uh, salmonella.
diarrhea in hospitalized patients.
the most frequent cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients is C-Diff
which can lead to toxic megacolon, perforation, sepsis and death.
that's what killed Susan.
is she okay? - Oh, she's fine.
dude, she's messed up. - Of course she's messed up.
Susan was basically her surrogate mother.
Yeah, her fake mom was better than her real mom.
is she going to the hospital first or the funeral?
first to the hospital, then to the funeral, then to the test this afternoon.
has she even studied? - Yeah, she studied. She's fine.
she just needs to be left alone, okay? So what's inside the carotid sheath? Izzie?
the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve.
Ah, that was too easy. Let's find you a hard one.
uh, what is this? - Uh, what is what?
Oh, yeah. That just came this morning.
you got... You got a spot at Mercy West! Why--why didn't you tell me?
because it's pending the results of the intern exam.
Oh, you know what this means, don't you?
you, you got, you got into Mercy West you got into Mercy West - I haven't told the chief yet.
you'll tell him today. He'll understand.
it's a smaller program, fewer residents... Fewer distractions, more surgeries.
and when I come home and ask you how your day went, you can actually tell me because I won't already know.
Hi. - Hi.
look, I... I know this is a- - an impossible day for you.
So...I'm just want to say one thing.
I brought a black suit, just in case. - Thank you.
but I think this is something I need to do by myself.
if you need me, just... let me know.
Oh, Cristina. - What is M.E.N. Syndrome?" Don't answer that.
the minister needs to see a copy of your vows before the wedding.
multiple endocrine neoplasia. Yes.
look, I know it's test day, and I'm not supposed to be talking about the wedding on test day - But since tomorrow's our wedding day- - You have five seconds. Go.
bill Adams can't make it. I have no best man.
Oh, no. Baby, I'm so sorry.
and I need your vows by- - Okay, time's up.
Cristina... - Test day.
what am I supposed to tell the minister? - Test day.
they paged you guys, too?
well, I think they paged all of us. - That can't be good.
sure it can. He could be letting us know I won the race for chief.
not today, he isn't.
he's making his recommendation to the board tomorrow for chief of surgery and chief resident.
why were we all paged?
Oh, because search and rescue found those lost climbers who were up on Mount Rainier.
people, the climbers are on their way. - Any specifics?
they found only three so far. One's still missing.
they're reporting severe dehydration with traumatic head and chest injuries.
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Torres, you'll be my trauma team.
bad day not to have interns. - What?
today's the intern exam.
you'll all have to do your own heavy lifting today.
and if you see an intern, which you will, because they can't help themselves, turn them away until after the exam.
the ambulances are five minutes away. It's time to do what we do best, people. Let's roll.
what is a gerota's fascia? - Uh, the fascia surrounding the kidney.
which is longer, the left or the right renal vein? - That's right. The left one.
looks and smarts-- not bad. - You think?
she's got my dad's nose, though.
girl's gotta have a big personality to pull off that nose.
what? - You--you remember your dad?
no. I don't--no.
you just said- - I know, but I... I have no idea where that came from.
that was a memory. That's what it's like sometimes.
it doesn't always come back all at once. It can happen in bits and pieces.
don't--don't get all- - Dude, your memory's coming back.
so how you feeling, Preston? You ready? - I'm always ready for surgery.
I think he's talking about the wedding. - Yeah, tomorrow's the big day.
and apart from the fact that Cristina hasn't written her vows, - My best man just canceled, and it's still raining... - He's not ready.
you're never ready. I certainly wasn't.
but then... The minute I saw Adele coming down that aisle...
well... Have you picked your best man?
actually, chief, I- - You can't be his best man.
why not? - Because it's unethical.
it's a conflict of interest. The man wants to be chief of surgery.
actually, Derek- - Not that that's why you're asking.
I was... Going to ask you. - Ask me what?
Really? We have been through a lot this year.
and everybody else turned you down.
Oh, what do I have to do?
well, traditionally the best man plans the bachelor party.
drinks at joe's after work? - Yeah.
I knew you were the man for the job.
Dale Winick, 32, B.P. 90 over 50, tachy to 110.
severe frostbite, but no obvious internal injuries.
got it. - My god.
Yeah, those aren't gloves.
please someone tell me this guy is ok.
they're right behind you. We'll let you know.
get him a tet-tox and push a gram of cefazolin I.V.
and let's get some warm, circulating water to start thawing his hands.
I'll get someone on it. Callie.
we're supposed to be studying. If Bailey finds out we're down here...
we are studying. How do you treat frostbite?
Rewarm, avoid early surgery unless there's a deep infection due to autoamputation.
see? Studying.
okay, okay, Mr. Meltzer, Mr. Meltzer, I'm gonna need you to save your breath, okay?
we're gonna give you some pain meds. You have several broken ribs, which are compromising your breathing. You understand?
did you see that? - That is freaky.
I think that was a flail chest. I've never seen one before.
come on. Come on.
why, oh, why does today have to be test day?
Oh, I know.
look... I bet you if you talk to the chief, he'll let you take the test later with the funeral and everything.
I don't need to take the test later. - Okay.
can I get a little help here? - I can't feel my legs!
sir, you have a spinal injury. You need to stop fighting me and stay calm, okay?
you're only making it worse. Where are we going?
you guys are going to trauma three. - All right. Trauma three.
you okay? - Yeah. I got accepted at Mercy West.
that's... Are you gonna go?
well, I kinda have to now, right?
what are you fools doing here?
in a few hours, you people are taking a test that will determine the course of your entire medical careers because the five interns with the lowest test scores will be cut from the program.
but are you studying for this test? No, you're not.
are you helping out in the ER? You are most certainly not!
are you getting the hell out of here before I throw you out?
I think you are.
whoa, Dr. Shepherd. - Aren't you supposed to be studying?
Yeah, I just have a quick question. - Yeah.
could the craniotomy you performed on Ava--on Jane Doe-- could
could that have affected her memory? - Uh, it's doubtful.
I was mostly working in the speech center of her brain. But you never know.
Why? - I think she remembered something.
can--can we test her to see if anything's changed? - Yeah, you can run another W.M.S.R.
but we're gonna have to wait and see if she remembers anything else.
good sign, though. - Thanks.
nice work, Dr. Montgomery. - Oh, thanks.
I was just directing traffic. - I was being sarcastic.
Oh, like brain surgery is so impressive. - It is, actually.
Addison. - Yes? Oh, Joe Walter.
what are you guys doing here? Everything okay?
Yeah, we came to see you, actually.
uh, we need a consult. - Don't tell me you're pregnant.
uh, no, but-- our birth mom is. - Potential birth mom.
she hasn't actually picked us yet. - You're adopting?
well, we filed an application, but we never thought we'd get picked.
you know, bar-owning gays don't get picked very often.
I guess having a baby is easier than we thought.
Yes, I guess so.
so I was hoping you could take a look at her?
you know, kicking the tires, checking underneath the hood?
car metaphors? No. - I'd be happy to.
just, uh, give me a call and we'll set up an appointment.
well, see, that's the thing.
uh, she lives in Portland, and she's only gonna be in Seattle for one day, so...
she's kind of here now.
now, as in... Now.
George, wait. Wait a minute. - Yeah?
you don't have to do this. You don't have to transfer to Mercy West.
Yeah, I do. - No.
just forget about you and me for a second, okay?
what about Meredith? What about Alex and Cristina?
who's gonna hold us together if you're not here?
you're the glue. You're George.
I can't stay here. I can't... - No one's making you go.
stay here and see you every day... And not...
I can't keep kissing you in elevators.
I know. I know that.
I'm married. I'm a married man.
you busy? - Cute. What are you doing here?
isn't the exam in like- - yeah, I know, I know.
I just want to run a quick neuro-psych test on you. - No. No! Go take your test. I-I have a baby to feed.
what the hell is wrong with you? - Nothing.
you've been sitting in this bed for weeks wishing you could remember who you were, now suddenly you can.
I can't. It was something I said.
well, you remember your father's face.
why are you acting like it's no big deal, like it happens all the time?
Alex, come on. I-I--it-- that's not...
unless it does happen all the time.
tell me the truth. Do you remember?
do you know who you are?
what is biloma? - Cristina, I really don't have time - A biloma is an intperitoneal bile fluid collection. - Excellent.
okay? I'll be fine. - Meredith.
George, I gotta go. - Your dad.
Hey. I-I-I was just on my way
no, I-I came here to tell you you're not wanted.
I don't want you at any funeral, Meredith.
thatcher, why don't you come... - She trusted you!
she came to you for help, and you killed her.
you did. You killed my wife. You took her from me.
dad!
so I don't--I don't want to see you.
I don't want to hear from you, and I don't want you anywhere near her funeral.
you understand me? Do you understand me? - Dad, dad, come on.
this-- Lexie's waiting in the car. We have to go, dad. We have to go now.
she was everything to me, all I had.
she was all I had.
she was all I had.
I can sit here all day.
I'll miss my test, but I will sit here all day.
I don't--I... It happened a few days ago, and I-I just...
I just woke up, and it was all there again. - And you didn't tell me?
Becau-- because there's... There's nothing to tell.
why don't I believe that?
I was a pregnant woman in a lousy marriage to the nicest guy anyone's ever met.
end of story. - Who--who is he? What does he do?
Wh-where--where did you meet him?
college. We got married the year after we graduated.
he... I wanted-- I wanted to move to New York, and he wanted to live on the side of a mountain and take over his dad's shop.
and he's a woodworker. He makes beautiful furniture.
It's--it's--it's quiet, and he's quiet and...
I was going out of my mind. - So you just... took off?
no, I... I need--I need--I need-- I needed to think and to be around other people, so I came to Seattle, and I... Thought I'd see the sights, ride the ferry.
have you even called him? - No.
why not? - I left him, Alex.
so? He's your husband. You should call him. You want me to call him?
I mean, what's his name? What's your name?
I'm not telling you that.
we've got everything taken care of. - You don't have to worry about a thing.
I've got number 2 pencils and bottled water.
Oh, and--and powerbars. - And you know the material.
you're gonna get a high score-- not as high as mine-- but everything's gonna be fine.
what are you guys all standing around for?
don't we have a test to-- what happened?
you people need to head upstairs. Dr. Grey will join you in a minute.
you're not to blame for Susan Grey's death, and you know it, and your father knows it, too.
he's just... Well, he's never been the best communicator, and he just lost his wife.
stop acting like my surrogate father. - Meredith, I'm j-- just because you slept with my mother, that does not make you my father.
follow my finger, okay?
good.
let me know if you can feel this, okay?
Yeah, I'm not enjoying that. - Good. That's a good sign.
it means I'm not paralyzed?
well, the M.R.I. will show us the full extent of the injuries.
but, uh, can we ask you what happened up there?
it was my fault. - Dale-- it wasn't your fault.
60 ways to get up Mount Rainier, and I had to pick Liberty Ridge it wasn't the route. It was the storm.
on a clear day, you don't think about storms.
a minute later, the wind's pasting you to the side of the mountain, and you can't see your hand in front of your face.
is that why you fell, because of the storm?
all I know is I felt the rope tug, and... I was in midair.
we all were. We were tied together.
must have been a 100-foot drop.
and when we came to, Lonnie wasn't moving.
Lonnie? He's your friend who's still missing?
well, this lonnie, is that why he didn't make it back, because he was hurt?
because he was dead. - I'm sorry.
we had to leave him.
we had to get to the other side of the mountain, or we'd be dead, too.
we had no choice. - You always have a choice.
you never leave a man behind.
please take your seats, doctors, and put all study materials away.
okay, if you don't know the answer, choose "B." It's always "B."
and write your name in the upper right-hand corner of your answer sheets.
you may open your test booklets... Now.
w-we don't have to be here if you're uncomfortable.
Oh, no, it's fine. Un-unless you're uncomfortable.
actually, uh, I-I- - he's fine.
so, Rina, how are you feeling? Any problems?
just the fact that I'm huge, and I have, like, the worst heartburn I've ever had in my life.
I can prescribe an antacid for that.
the first thing we're gonna do is take a look at the baby.
this might be a little cold.
this baby deserves parents who are gonna make it their whole world, you know?
y-you know we're gay, right?
I figured, with you both being boys and everything.
the other couple I'm considering, they're, like, oh, 40.
she's been trying to get pregnant for ten years.
it's so sad. There's the heartbeat.
there's, like, a person inside of me.
actually... There are two people. Twins.
Oh, my god. - Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. I think I'm gonna pass out.
doctors, we are halfway through our allotted time.
you only have 60 minutes left to complete the exam.
she didn't write anything on the test. She didn't answer a single question. She just sat there.
wait, G-George, just-- just give her a second.
I've got an extensive antero-lateral flail chest.
he'll need surgical stabilization. Dr. Torres, if you're available, I would really...
she's not. My guy has bone fragments in his spinal cord, internal fixation.
Dr. Torres is gonna scrub in with me.
uh, we have more than one orthopedic surgeon in this hospital.
and you'll need 'em, because Dr. Torres and I are looking at possible multiple amputations.
guys, I can be there for all of you. We just have to figure it out.
Dr. Burke asked first.
well, I mean, with all due respect- - okay, you all want Torres. Fine.
rock, paper, scissors.
one, two, three. - All rocks. Very typical. Ready?
and... rock smashes scissors.
see you in the O.R. - Best two out of three.
Dr. Burke!
what?
I just wanted to know how it feels...
to not have to spend the next 24 hours wondering if Richard picked you to be chief resident.
how's it feel to be the chosen one?
feels just fine.
Hey. How'd it go?
Meredith. - Don't worry. I've got it.
it's not like she actually flunked. She--she just didn't write anything.
it's kinda like she actually flunked.
one guy two years ago, he was on call three nights before his test.
he slept through the whole thing. He had to repeat this intern year.
she can't repeat her intern year. It's pathetic. We have to do something.
Cristina. - What? O-okay, I don't know.
I mean, Meredith and I don't fail things. This is not in my book.
it's Bailey. We gotta go. We gotta go.
we can't just leave her here. - You got a better idea?
okay, it's, uh, showtime, people. Yang, you're scrubbing in with Dr. Burke.
Karev, you're with Dr. Montgomery. Stevens, find Dr. Sloan.
you paged me, too. - Mercy West.
Callie told you.
you're in the best surgical program in the country, the toughest, most competitive, most respected.
you want to leave this for mercy west?
mercy West- - is not Seattle grace.
are you trying to... After all the work that we've put into you, are you trying to throw your career away?
I'm trying to... Do what's best for me right now. I've had some personal issues.
I-I don't know what your personal problems are, and I don't care.
I do care about your career, so let me make myself clear.
this is a mistake.
it's like we're on a train that's going 200 miles an hour, and it would just be so nice to get off and just... Stand on the platform just for a minute.
looks like I'm off the train.
our parents died. When a parent dies, it doesn't make any sense.
so you make a lot of really terrible decisions...
that you're gonna end up having to live with for a long time.
you should go. You are still on the train.
it's okay. You have to go.
go. Go. Go, go.
what are you doing here? What happened?
a fender bender. I'm fine. I told the E.R.
resident I'm fine, but...
all right, I'm gonna page Richard. I'll let him kno you're here.
Oh, you will do no such thing, Addison.
richard cannot know I'm here.
we're separated.
my life is none of his business.
I'm serious.
okay.
uh, all right. Well... let's get you checked out.
do you have any, um, any pain, any... anything?
well... there's one thing I should probably mention.
I'm pregnant.
the baby looks fine on the ultrasound, but you are spotting a little.
it's nothing severe, but I would like to hold you overnight for observation.
overnight? Oh, no. I'm sorry , but-- for just a couple of hours at least. Look, it could be nothing.
but a pregnancy at your age is...
terrifying? Embarrassing?
I was going to say a miracle.
I don't know. I resigned myself to the fact a long time ago that I would never have kids, and here I am, 52, about to be divorced and pregnant.
may I ask who... the father is?
you may ask.
look, all I'm saying is that if Richard finds out that you're walking around this hospital carrying another man's baby...
richard is not going to find out because neither one of us are going to tell him.
chief. - Addison.
I just heard the news.
you--you heard?
who told you? What--what did you hear?
that Joe and Walter are adopting.
is the birth mom here? I'd love to put in a good word.
Oh, no, no, no.
chief, you don't want to go in there.
it's a young girl... in the stirrups, you know, her equipment exposed, right?
you don't want to see that.
no, I-I don't want to see that.
are you going to give me an inspirational speech, too?
no.
Oh, I can't talk. I have a patient to prep.
this isn't about you and me. This is about Meredith. What are we gonna do?
there's nothing to do. - What?
I'm not even gonna be here in a week, so...
so your transferring to another hospital means we're not gonna be friends anymore?
why are you doing this, George?
didn't you hear a word of what Bailey said?
what were we supposed to do, hmm, carry him down the mountain?
he was our friend, and we left him there.
if we hadn't, we'd be dead, too.
you know that.
Dale was right.
you don't-- you don't do that.
you don't climb all the way up there together just to leave a man behind.
I am being stalked by pregnant women.
you're an obstetrician.
and barren. You know, apparently as a healthy, successful woman in her 30s, I don't deserve to have a baby.
maybe I'd have a fighting chance if were gay or a teenager or a member of the A.A.R.P.
Oh, that sucks.
it really...
no, oh, no, not you, too.
Oh, no, no, I'm not. I'm just-- I'm thinking about it.
that's all.
Oh, I don't know. I don't even know.
it's just that with George going to Mercy West next year... - He is?
Yeah, they havea spot for him, and we need a fresh start.
we need to get away from all this crap.
it might be a good time.
it's a great time.
don't let me and my fossilized eggs discourage you.
are we gonna be friends still if I get pregnant?
absolutely not.
Hi, chief. - O'malley.
finally coming to see me about that letter from Mercy West?
no, sir.
I'm here about Meredith.
I have to say, I don't get it.
why would anybody waste their time freezing and climbing up the side of a glacier?
it's a way to test yourself, you know, your strength and endurance.
you put yourself through a situation like that, and you know exactly who you are, what you're made of.
have you done it before, Dr. Burke?
no. You?
I used to, all the time, in college.
Really? - really?
Yeah, it's, intense.
I mean, it's painful and hellish, and you think your lungs are shredding, but, man, when you get to the top, there is nothing like it.
makes the whole climb worth it.
how's it going?
worse than I thought. There's nothing here.
we're gonna amputate both?
you can't amputate both of his hands.
I-isn't the left hand less damaged?
I don't want to take the man's hands, Dr. Stevens.
once the infection gets that deep, the only way to save his life is to make the cut.
the patient's laminotomy happens at what level, Dr. O'malley?
the level of maximal neural compressions between the pedicles of the fractured vertebrae.
very good.
you must have aced your exam today.
I don't know about aced.
how did Meredith do?
Yeah, she was kinda...
don't worry, though. I talked to the chief.
about what?
she didn't tell you?
all right, here's the thing-- the Seattle police department's been on this for weeks.
they've been in contact with missing persons from all 50 states, Canada, the FBI.
Alex- - you know how many people are trying to find you?
Yeah, yes. - That's right. You do know.
you know exactly how many relatives you have.
you know if your parents are dead or alive.
you know if you've got a sister somewhere who cries every day because she has no idea what happened to you.
stop it. - What do you think it's like for your husband?
he didn't come looking for me, okay?
he obviously doesn't want to find me.
besides, it's my life. - No, not just yours.
what about your daughter?
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna lie for you.
if you're not gonna tell anybody, I will.
what are you gonna say?
you don't know my real name.
you don't know anything about me.
it'll be my word against yours.
you're right. I have absolutely no idea who you are.
you paged me? Yeah.
uh, I think I figured out a way to help Meredith.
but I've got Shepherd's post-op, so... I can't do it without your help.
and I won't leave the program without, uh, knowing that she's still in it.
you're not leaving the program.
listen... we made a mistake.
we had sex.
but that's all it was.
I think we both wanted it to mean something because...
you didn't want to have to feel like that guy that cheats on his wife, and I didn't want to have to feel like that girl who put you in that position in the first place.
but the truth is... it didn't mean anything.
I know you think I have feelings for you, but I don't.
so you can stay.
you're not leaving the program.
nice work...three surgeries at the same time.
I performed four osteosyntheses, amputated two hands and stabilized one spine in two hours.
impressive.
looks like Bailey's not a shoo-in for chief resident after all.
uh, you're in the running for chief resident, too?
Yeah.
why wouldn't I be?
no. Uh, it makes sense.
I just... I hadn't thought about it. That's all.
I'm good at what I do, Bailey.
I'm focused, I'm disciplined, I'm--I'm more than qualified to be chief resident.
look, we all know that you're the chief's favorite, but that doesn't mean I can't take a shot.
here she is.
thank you, Stevens. You can go now.
we'll be waiting right outside.
you don't have to. Shut up.
if you called me here to lecture me
there's a copy of the intern's exam on the table, some number 2 pencils, a bottle of water and a sandwich if you get hungry.
I'll send a proctor in, and I'll come back in a few hours and check on you.
you are not my father.
I know that.
I know.
well, at least test day is almost over.
speak for yourself.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Hey. Hey.
this is what you invited me to?
this is your big bachelor party?
it was last-minute. I needed some warm bodies.
which would explain why I'm here.
why am I the only girl, by the way?
what am I, the entertainment? I am not stripping.
that's okay. We've seen it already.
true. I haven't. - Yeah, well, why don't I buy you a drink instead?
first round's on me.
I'll give you a hand with those.
Cristina write her vows?
I guess I'll find out tomorrow.
how's Meredith doing?
I have no idea.
shouldn't be this difficult, should it?
probably not.
then again... when I see Cristina walking down that aisle tomorrow...
it'll all be worth it?
so how was L.A.?
L.A. was... different.
look, Mark... things don't have to be awkward between us.
we tried. We tried, and we did our best , and just because we failed as a couple, it doesn't mean...
I know. - So we're still friends?
with benefits?
don't push it.
Thanks, Joe.
so hey, how'd it go with, uh, Rina?
Oh, well... Walter took her to the bus station, and I'm pretty sure he was wishing it was me he was dropping off.
that bad, huh?
if I can't even make it through an ultrasound without breathing into a paper bag, how am I gonna handle a kid?
forget about twins.
you two are gonna make great parents, okay?
whenever that happens.
you... ever think about having kids?
all the time.
Oh, come on. I know you saw me.
now this is just silly.
you don't have to hide.
I've moved on.
I'm dating now.
O-okay, I'm not actually dating, but I intend to... at some point.
what the hell am I supposed to do about the stupid vows?
you still haven't written anything?
well, it's stupid crap. - No, it isn't.
well, what am I supposed to say?
I swear to love and cherish you every moment of every day of my life?
I mean, that's not real. I mean, that's not how it works, right?
it does, at first, but then it... - It passes.
no, it doesn't.
you guys are just used to it. That's all. You already have it.
you have that thing everybody else wants.
you can take it for granted.
but let me tell you, if you didn't, if you couldn't be with the person that you love,
I guarantee that hearing him promise to love you and honor you and cherish you, no matter what, it would be pretty much all you could think about.
wait, can you say that again, uh, just slowly?
you're talking about Denny, right?
Yeah.
Hi. Hi.
can I buy you a drink?
you're forward.
bad day.
I get to be forward today.
Yeah, I had a bad day, too.
so what do you say, one drink?
um... I'm with some friends. It's a bachelor party. So I'm gonna... I'm gonna say no.
that's too bad.
yeah... maybe you're right.
that's my name.
Adele, come on.
now you've got me in this ladies' room.
the least you could do.
Adele. Oh, my god.
what are you doing here?
sweetie, get Rina some water.
I thought you guys were going to the bus station.
we were.
it's this heartburn.
it's like it's-- it's ripping through... oh!
call an ambulance.
Tucker, uh, since he's awake, can you put him on?
let me call you back.
Nicole, what have you got?
we got the fourth climber. Pressure's 70s, last pulse 135.
severely hypothermic. Started two large-bore I.V.S.
Oh, and, uh, obvious head trauma.
is that an axe in his head?
what the hell happened up on that mountain? Let's go.
Adele. Somebody help me! Please!
somebody help me! Please!
I'm in love with you, George, and I hope you're in love with me, too.
I was named chief resident.
I've failed my intern test.
you can start from the very beginning.
repeat my internship?
I met a woman last night. - Hi.
you met a woman last night?
I'm lexie. Lexie Grey.
he's gone.
I can't leave you, but you're constantly leaving me.
it's over...so over.
innovation is everything.
nothing remains the same for long.
we either adapt to change...
or we get left behind.
I have five rules. Memorize them.
rule number one, don't bother sucking up.
I already hate you. That's not gonna change.
trauma protocols, phone lists, pagers. The nurses will page you.
you answer every page at a run-- a run. That's rule number two.
you're supposed to follow me.
your first shift starts now and lasts 36 hours.
you're grunts, nobodies, the bottom of the surgical food chain.
you run labs, you write orders, you work every second night until you drop, and you don't complain.
on call rooms. Sleep when you can, where you can.
you know, but not with anybody.
not attendings-- especially not attendings.
sleeping with attendings-- not a good idea.
where was I?
um, rule number three.
if you're sleeping, do not wake you unless a patient's actually dying.
the dying patient better not be dead when I get there, because not only will you have killed someone, you will have woken me for no good reason. Are we clear?
yes? - That was four rules. You said five.
rule number five-- when I move, you move.
go!
I hate them. You don't hate them. You hate you.
that was hideous. I feel like a fraud.
I rocked it. I think I'm the new nazi.
Oh, you are not the new nazi.
Meredith, I need to talk to you.
George. Hi. - Hey.
how was your vacation? - Um, fine.
um, Meredith, can we - 'Cause mine was...
I didn't do much. I hung out alone...for 17 days.
which is the last time that I saw you, the day of cristina's wedding, which was...well...
then Meredith and Cristina went on Cristina's honeymoon without me.
girl-on-girl honeymoon.
and then Alex took a road trip to see Ava without me.
I did not go to see Ava. And her name's Rebecca.
and I didn't go see her. I just drove in that direction.
Oh, why is everyone so tingly and hurt?
I mean, I'm the one who was left at the altar.
I'm fine, by the way.
I honeymooned in Hawaii and I snorkled.
What'd you do, George?
um, Meredith... - I- I really need to talk to you.
uh, hey, you want to know
Hey, um, this is for residents only. No interns.
Yeah. - Yeah, get outta here.
babies. - Yeah, go away.
007s in traini.
seriously.
I guess I should be going, too.
no, George. We didn't mean you.
no, I'm an intern. - Wait. What did you want to tell me?
uh, is this how it's gonna be all year?
because bambi has got to learn how to cope.
at least he came back.
Yeah, cut him some slack.
dude, he failed his exam and got left back in kindergarten.
Mm-hmm.
he won't even look at me.
have you seen Burke?
no. Have you seen Derek?
no.
wait, you haven't seen either of them since the wedding?
Nope.
and you're all fine?
Yep - Wow.
you're either incredibly healthy or completely messed up.
your interns are back from holiday today.
uh, not my interns. They're residents. I'm free.
right. Well--here, nurse. The point is, uh, dr. Yang.
the Burke thing-- she doesn't know.
I'm supposed to tell her.
Burke asked me to tell her. Any thoughts?
honesty always works best. - Yeah, that's true.
you want to get together for a drink after work tonight?
Why? - Well, I don't know.
I just thought it might be a good idea to get together and have. oh, you don't have anybody to talk to.
no, I have people to talk to.
Addison is gone, Burke isn't around, and you and Grey aren't smelling each other in the elevators anymore.
I have people to talk to. - Who?
I have...chief.
I- I have the chief to talk to. Hey, chief.
want to get together for a drink after work?
I don't drink. Dr. Bailey, we need to talk.
we have traumas coming in. - You're avoiding me. We need to talk.
about you choosing dr. Torres to be your chief resident over me?
respectfully, no, sir. We're not going to talk about that.
someone mention a drink later?'Cause I'm in.
nobody mentioned a drink. - You mentioned a drink.
I did not mention a drink.
all right, people. We've got three M. V.C. S rolling in back-to-back from a multicar pileup.
we need every trauma room open and everyone suited up.
is there anything I-I should do, sir?
save lives. - No. I mean as, uh, chief resident.
anything in particular?
make sure your residents run their traumas.
this is their first day on their own.
Where...are the residents you've assigned to this E. R?
Oh. Oh, I,uh, I,uh, I paged them. I-- I paged them.
Bailey? - What?
uh, I,uh, paged, uh, Grey, Yang, Stevens and Karev, but they're not here yet.
when I page them, they come running.
get it together, Torres.
Yes, sir.
okay, you did not have to say that in front of the chief.
you asked...boss.
there's Derek.
is burke with him? - I don't see him.
where have you been? We have multiple M. V.C. S due any second.
we're here, aren't we? We're here.
just-- just get ready, okay? And monitor your interns.
okay, one, two, go get stat packs.
uh, three, four, go meet the ambulances.
one and two? - No, I can't remember their names.
I don't respond to being called a number.
George, go wait for the ambulance.
the rest of you come with me.
all right, you guys stand against the wall and out of the way unless I call for you.
okay, this is what's called a trauma situation.
so there's gonna be lots of activity and a lot of patients, so if you guys have any questions at all, just ask, okay?
I heard she, like, freaked out and killed a guy and had to go on probation.
great. We're stuck with a dud.
so, hey, you're an intern...again.
Yeah.
I won't tell anybody. The other interns, - I won't-- - That's--that's okay.
do you know which one is Meredith Grey?
Yeah, I haven't, uh, told her you're here yet. I was going to...
so you know who I am?
Yeah, I know who you are.
what's she like? I-I mean, is she nice?
Cause--'cause my dad, he won't--he won't tell me. Is sh--sh...
uh, Grey, don't let them just stand here.
let's move, people.
unrestrained driver, D.O. A.At the scene.
just need someone to pronounce him.
Oh, crap. Dead guy. Why'd you get me all excited with the sirens?
okay, who wants to see a dead guy?
Nancy Walters, 34 years old, weeks pregnant. Complete upper arm amputation.
pressure dressings applied. Two large bore I. V.S started.
did he say "arm"? My arm is gone?
miss Walters, you're gonna be okay. Grey, check the wound.
I really need my arm.
45-year-old male, sustained a knee injury.
that guy, the guy that's dead, he hit a deer, and then the lady hit him, and then I hit the lady.
knee is blowing up like a balloon.
Hey, I'm hungry. Can I get something to eat?
okay, everybody get a good look? Time of death-- 8: 22.
not time of death. This guy is not dead.
he was dead. - Well, he's not dead now.
let's bag him. Okay, we've got a
we've got a guy who's risen from the dead over here.
get outta the way!
are-- are you Meredith Grey? - Yeah.
I-- I'm Lexie. - Great. Move.
Lexie Grey. I'm-- I'm your sister.
that girl out there, the dopey, wide-eyed one?
apparently we're related.
Oh, you--you met Lexie?
Oh, you knew. Knew about it and didn't tell me, huh?
I've...kind of had a lot thing on.
this is trauma room one. As you can see, it's
there's a trauma.
Hey, guys, do you need some help? Please tell me you need some help.
it's a little crded in here already, Iz.
what do you got for me?
uh, Nancy Walters. Complete amputation.
the baby looks fine, but she's having some contractionS.
Hi, Nancy. I'm dr. Sloan. You mind if I take a look?
it's a clean cut.
you want to rub up against me, you gotta buy me a drink first.
hang antibiotics and put on a sterile, moist dressing.
there's a chance at a good recovery here.
do we have an arm?
they're looking for it.
my baby has no father. He's already down two arms.
so he r-really needs me to have an arm.
get me that arm.
okay, somebody set up for a traumatic effusion drainage.
Ah...
and order him 4 of morphine.
she means one of you morons.
get her an 18 gauge needle and a 20 cc syringe and the damn morphine.
Hey, uh, morphine's cool, but I'd kill for something to eat.
a healthy appetite after a trauma like this?
that's a very good sign, Joey.
you think he'll need surgery?
that depends on the x-rays.
knee looks good. No surgery.
okay. This is Cristina-- dr. Yang.
she's working.
Yep, saving lives and taking names.
so...I have these interns and nothing to do.
and, uh, I think I'm a really bad teacher.
and I think they hate me. And now I'm a fraud.
so any chance you wanna let me in on this? Please.
Izzie, this guy was dead, and now he's undead.
so that kinda makes him like a zombie my personal zombie. So no, you can't get in on this.
now go be A...fraud somewhere else.
I don't like you. - Mm-hmm.
let's go, people. - Excuse me.
you know, where have you been? I've been waiting for these.
I got--I was-- I met my sister, uh, for the first time ever...
Oh, hey. Which, uh, got me, you know, weird.
so then I got, um, lost on my way to x-ray 'cause I was all in my head, you know, about-- about meeting Meredith.
Meredith is your-- is your sister?
Meredith Grey. Lexie Grey. We're half sisters. So you know her?
Oh, we need to page dr. Shepherd.
Dr. Shepherd. He--he's the, um...neurosurgeon?
okay, somebody page Derek Shepherd right freakin' now.
Grey. Thank you.
Seattle grace.
thank you.
Hi. How are you?
I have a patient with a severed arm and no one seems to be able to find it.
have you seen it?
your severed arm? No, I haven't seen a severed arm.
Meredith, how - hey, um, I'm--I'm so sorry about before.
I just was so nervous about meeting you.
don't block the E. R.Doors. I know that now.
that was a good lesson.
you're the girl from the bar. - Sorry?
the girl from the bar?
Oh, my god. Yeah. Oh, my god. Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, my god. You--you work here.
Yeah, I do.
girl from the bar? - Mm-hmm.
I'm the girl from the bar.
uh...She hates me. My sister hates me.
Meredith is your sister? - My half sister, yeah.
Hey, uh, you're dr. Shepherd. - That's right.
I'm--I'm supposed to be finding you for a consult.
Hey. There you are. I missed you this morning.
Yeah, I didn't want to be late for my second first day as an intern.
maybe you can look at it like this-- you have one up on everyone.
you're gonna be, like, the rock star intern.
Yeah, I'm sure that's how everyone's gonna see me when they find out.
or maybe they'll see you as the daddy intern.
what?
wh-what did you just say?
oh...I'm not-- I'm not pregnant. I just...
I mean, I might be pregnant.
Yeah, my boobs are a little sore, which...
Hey, I'm trying to cheer you up here, George.
this is--I mean, if I am knocked up, that's a good thing, right?
Callie, I'm just a little distracted. I'm having a bad day.
okay, you're having a bad month.
okay, I'm having a bad month.
love you.
help! We need doctors. Help! - Inside voice.
uh, we found an arm in the road.
here, I bagged that - That's my arm.
dad, dad, tell them she's hurt! Dad, come on.
tell the doctor! Tell them she's hurt.
uh, any way we can go with the severed arm? - She's in the truck, and she's hurt.
is that your blood? Are you hurt?
she's in our truck, and she's not moving. v
she's bleeding really bad.
there's another crash victim.
we're gonna need gloves, I.V. S,gauze, ab pads, trauma gowns.
still want to babysit the arm?
come on
no way.
is she dead?
Michael, this is a hospital, and I'm a people doctor. I...
can you save her? - Michael, come on.
I'm sorry, but she's - roadkill.
she opened her eyes. Look. She's still alive!
Oh, god. Don't look at me like that. Or like that.
Michael, let's go back to the truck Come on.
please.
Oh, okay, all right. All right.
uh, I'm gonna need a jumbo catheter, a 16 gauge needle, the biggest ambu bag you can find and something that shaves fur.
what's the matter with you people? When I say move, you move. Move!
back of his skullis completely disconnected from his first cervical vertebrae.
he's been internally decapitateD. Holy crap.
Yeah, 90% of these die in the field.
and the other 10%?
I've never seen one live.
there's always a first time, though, right?
I mean, he came back from the dead.
Henry, I'm dr. Shepherd.
the back of your skull is disconnected from your spine.
I'm gonna try and reconnect it in surgery.
do you understd me?
blink once for yes, twice for no.
okay, good. I know it's scary, but I promise you, I'm gonna do everything I can.
do you have family?
all right. We're gonna contact them, okay?
all right, let's get him in a halo. - uh-huh.
contact his family. find out if he's an organ donor.
you, finish up with the splint, then get him up on crutches.
Hey. How's Joey?
it's a hungry hippo missing a kneecap.
can't you assign me something good?
I don't switch out patients, Karev.
but it's not even surgical.
it's a waste of my skills.
you're staying here with Joey. - Come on.
No! - Fine. I'm going to bailey
you are a resident. You go where I say.
my arm is gone.
we have the arm, and dr. Sloan checking right now to see if we can reattach it.
is there someone we can call?
there's no...no, I just...I just moved here.
I'm all-- I'm all by myself. There's no one. I have no one.
well, dr. Sloan should be here any minute.
I wanted a kid and...
I was sick of waiting for the right guy, so...
in my family...
in my family, you don't go out and get pregnant.
so now I'm alone and...
I'm having a baby, and I don't have a father for the baby, - and I don't have an arm. - it's okay.
here's dr. Sloan.
Nancy...I'm happy to report that your arm is in good shape.
Dr. Grey here is gonna clean it up a little, and
and I'm gonna put that arm back where it belongs, okay?
okay.
okay.
we got a 150-pound female with...
lacerations on the chest and haunches, short, fast breaths.
any recommendations?
uh, doctor, Michael's a big boy.
he doesn't need you to perform make-believe medicine, right, Michael?
it's not make-believe. She can help.
Michael, enough. I apologize. We're just wasting your time.
no kidding.
Michael. - Please don't let her die.
Michael, it is a deer.
we're gonna take her home and skin her and freeze the meat, okay?
what? Why?
because that's what you do. You don't try and save them. You eat them.
no, Dad. The doctor can save her.
no, she can't. - You don't know that.
my son needs to learn to grow up and face things.
you're right. I am not helping him.
I'm helping bambi.
so get me the ambu bag and the sane. I'm starting an I. V.
thank you.
still no sign of Burke. Oh, you've got a severed arm.
my arm. Mine. Get away from it.
maybe he's not on today.
maybe you should just see him and get it over with.
no, no, no, no.
if I never see him again, I won't care.
well, I've seen Derek, and Derek has seen me.
And? Awkward. Plus he seems to know Lexie.
And?
more awkward. Your intern is my half sister.
how weird is that?
well, I'm trying to save bambi's life.
my interns think I'm a loser.
severed arm. - Callie's a bitch.
word. - She won't let me off my patient, and there's nothing wrong with him except he's a nut job.
severed arm.
does anybody know anything about deer?
ey taste good.
evil.
Oh, George, severed arm.
plus Meredith's half sister is my intern, Izzie is playing dr. Dolittle, oh, and Alex hates your wife.
Dr. Sloan's ready for the arm.
I'll say it. - George is being an ass.
I think it's my fault.
I said some things, and now he's not talking to me.
I don't know what he's got to complain about.
those new chick interns are hot.
he's married, Alex. - Yeah, he's married.
you know who's seriously hot? That Lexie girl.
get out...before I hurt you.
I'm going over Callie's head to Bailey.
uh, Callie is over Bailey's head.
spiritually, Bailey's over everyone's head.
Dr. Bailey. How are things going?
I wouldn't know. Ask dr. Torres.
Miranda - I don't want to talk.
Miranda, it is not like you not to want to talk.
fine. How's your wife?
well, she's...she's...good.
I haven't moved back in yet.
she hasn't let me move back in yet.
she's not taking my calls. Wait.
that's not what I want to talk to you about.
I want to talk about chief resident.
now we're gonna have this conversation.
are you ordering me to stand here and talk to you about this, chief?
no, I'm not ordering you.
but I just thought we could - Okay, then. Good-bye, sir.
I talked to the family they're on their way.
good, put an entire O. R. On hold. We don't have much time.
uh, can I get a progress note?
uh, do you maybe want to have a drink later?
what? - A drink.
give me one reason why we can't hang out.
I don't like you.
you don't like me because of Meredith?
I don't like you because you're you.
hmm. How is Meredith, by the way?
is she okay?
she's fine.
she's always fine. That's her problem.
we're fine people. We do fine. We're fine.
how's dr. Burke? I haven't seen him around.
is--is he off today?
here.
Dr. Burke handed in his letter of resignation two weeks ago.
he wanted me to tell you.
he's g-gone?
I'm sorry.
well, don't be. I'm - fine?
Yeah.
circulatory system of a deer? - Shut up.
Oh, dr. Bailey.
uh, couldn't you use an extra set of hands in the O. R. Today?
I saw an appy on the board. I'm--I'm great at appys.
talk to Torres. She's in charge of what cas you get now.
it's hard to set a shattered kneecap when your patient's in the pit, don't you think?
whatever.
I don't know how you did it.
did what?
get them to listen to you, to give you some respect.
Hey, dr. Bailey, you wouldn't happen to know anything about, uh, the anatomy of a deer?
not my intern, not my business, not anymore.
your husband's injuries are s-severe.
uh, they're traumatic in the extreme.
I'm sorry. What does that mean?
the only thing holding his head on to his body is skin and muscle.
if he moves even a fraction of an inch, it could kill him.
s-so are you saying that the
I'm--I'm saying that when you see him, this could be the last time
this could be the last time you see him alive.
are you in pain, sweetie?
good.
two blinks-- you aren't in pain.
why isn't daddy answering?
just-- right now we just need to wish daddy good luck in his surgery and tell him how much we love him. Okay?
cause we do.
I love you so much, Henry.
what's--what's three blinks?
uh, we've only been working with one and two.
is it "I love you"?
are you telling us you love us?
three blinks is I love you.
we're gonna be fine, Henry.
you're gonna make it, and we're all gonna be just fine.
it's time to go.
okay, guys. Let's let these doctors fix daddy up.
why are you avoiding me?
I'm on my way to surgery.
no, I don't mean right now. I mean.
not one word i17 days?
I tell you that I love you, and not one word? Where have you been?
I've been right here.
you know where? Exactly where I was a year ago.
I'm sorry.
I--I'm freaking out.
I'm an intern again.
Yeah, we're all freaking out.
we're all freaking out.
I'm in charge of a group of interns who think I'm crazy.
and I might actually be crazy, because day one of me being in charge, and I'm obsessed with rescuing bambi.
we're all freaking out.
since when did you start calling me Bambi?
what? - I'm not calling you bambi.
no, I mean, I know I-I-- I under-- I expect it from Cristina or Alex, - but- - I'm Bambi.
I'm bambi, George, okay?
if anyone in this situation is a sad little cartoon character, it's me.
I'm all alone in the forest-- all alone in the forest, George
and my mother's been shot by a hunter, and where are you?
where the hell are you?
I'm on my way to surgery.
I am really up for a drink, you know?
if you, uh, need to talk.
what would i need to talk about?
you were lucky, man.
that girl jerked you around.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, I'm just seemed like you could use a friend about now.
Meredith's mother never wanted her.
and her father was never man enough to hang around.
she has a right to be damaged, and us, together, it's a big step for her.
her best friend gets left on the altar, and all she sees now is things like this, they don't work.
she panics.
she wants this.
she doesn't know how to have it.
and you know what?
that's not her fault.
so don't ever talk to me about Meredith Grey again, because you do not know what you're talking about.
and I don't need a friend.
okay, Nancy, I want you to count back from a hundred, okay?
no.
no. I'm not ready.
it's just like going to sleep.
I can't do any of this alone.
I don't want to be alone anymore.
I know.
no, I'm scared. - I know.
I am scared, Meredith.
I know.
I think it's very brave, what you're doing.
it's much better to be alone and feel like a success than to be in a relationship and feel like a failure all the time, right?
that's what I think.
so let's just take care of your arm, and then we'll deal with the rest later, okay?
well, it looks like I'm back to babysitting.
what the hell? Who took my clamps and the bandage scissors?
there's a foreign body.
his abdomen's rigid.
somebody page dr. Bailey right now.
go!
come on, Joey.
you like hamburgers, don't you?
Yeah.
and spaghetti with meatballs, and lasagna?
that's beef.
that's cow you're eating, son.
