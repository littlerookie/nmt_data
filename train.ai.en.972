the family that used to run their whiskey distribution?
but according to the files, they haven't spoken in years.
exactly.
bringing the families back together again fits right into his sweet spot.
does organized crime have someone undercover with the Conroys?
they do.
he agreed to contact Flynn, set up a meet, and vouch for one of our agents.
who are you sending?
no. Peter, you can't.
it's too dangerous.
says the man who broke into Flynn's office and stole a drink.
this is our best shot at getting them on record.
and it allows you to be there to keep an eye on me.
hmm, guess you're right.
your cover better be airtight.
which means I need to talk to an expert on the Conroys and Flynns.
but they didn't check his boot.
Conroy Sr. had a snubnose tucked in there.
problem was, when he went to grab it, he couldn't pull the damn thing out.
that's when the Flynns cut off ties with him.
Conroys were lucky that's all they cut off.
this is all very helpful.
I know.
all right, I'm gonna study up on this, and, uh, I'll see you later.
I should get going, too.
uh, hang on a second.
can you stick around?
sure.
have a seat.
I saw the whiskey container.
there is a gun in there -- the same kind used to kill Ellen.
we get the gun, we get Flynn.
I should have taken it.
no, no, no. You did the right thing.
Peter has a good plan.
you should stick to it.
make sure they don't get away with this.
do you believe me, Neal?
I want to.
but there's one thing I don't understand.
Ellen said you told her you were innocent, and then you confessed.
why would you confess to a murder you didn't commit?
I've never told this to anyone, not even Ellen.
a couple of days after I was arrested, she came to see me.
she'd done some digging, and she realized that I was framed.
she also realized that the Flynns didn't have the cops in their pocket.
they were working for the cops, some people very high up on the force.
and for the first time, I had hope.
but then I got a phone call, and the man on the other end of the line wanted Ellen to stop investigating immediately.
he threatened to kill everybody I cared about -- Ellen, your mother, you.
the only way to protect everyone was to confess and turn state's evidence against the Flynns.
the marshals immediately pulled you and your mother into Witness Protection.
what about Ellen?
the same.
they were worried the Flynns would try and get to her, too.
I thought I'd join you and your mom in WITSEC, but, uh, she filed for divorce.
she wanted separate locations.
I don't blame her. She thought I was cop killer.
so you gave up everything to keep us safe.
I gave up everything the minute I took that cash.
do you know who was on the phone?
I don't.
but you don't kill a cop and get a phone call unless it's somebody very powerful.
police chief maybe.
never could figure that part out.
but Flynn would know.
look, if we find out, you can stop running.
I can't even imagine what that would be like.
I'll be meeting with Flynn as Mark Conroy.
he's the most camera-shy of the family.
few know what he looks like, and he's about my age.
Neal's at the warehouse now, working on the bottles.
I'm scheduled to arrive there in an hour.
once Peter uses the trigger phrase,"We have a deal," we move in.
what's your response time?
we'll be two blocks down to avoid any chance of being seen, so I'm guessing a minute, 90 seconds tops.
great. Let's move out.
there's something about the art of crafting a piece from within that's exquisitely challenging.
okay, Chihuly, good work.
Flynn. - Conroy.
hold still.
you know how it is.
you can't be too careful.
you should tell them to go ahead and check my boot.
that's water under the bridge.
glad to hear it.
check the boot.
is this McCann or your forgery?
you can't tell by my smile?
and the glasswork?
we could make a lot of money on this.
Oh, I agree.
they did great work.
and, luckily, we won't be needing them for too much longer.
what do you mean?
well, we've recorded their process.
we can use the video to train our own guys.
but why get rid of them?
are they becoming a problem?
eh, well, they've seen too much, including you now.
it's just best to be safe.
how many bottles are they making for you?
55. - That's right.
they're finishing up bottle number 55 right now.
take care of them.
you know, I'd love to meet them before you do.
this is great work.
Nah, it's best if you don't get too familiar.
never good to name them if you're not gonna keep them, you know?
Yeah.
then it looks like we have a deal.
that's our signal. Everybody move.
what?
we haven't even talked numbers yet.
Oh, with this quality work, I know we'll come to an understanding.
I'd like to try some of your other whiskeys.
do you mind?
uh, help yourself.
Oh, this is fantastic, yeah.
call your men off now.
call them off -- right now.
I don't know what you're talking about.
FBI! On the ground! - FBI!
check it!
I'm gonna check on Peter.
Dennis Flynn Jr.you're under arrest for intent to distribute counterfeit items and attempted murder and whatever crimes you may have committed with this weapon.
you planted that gun.
I've never seen it before in my life.
bet your dad said the same thing.
did forensics come back?
ballistics matched Flynn's gun to Ellen's murder weapon.
so we got him. - We did.
what aren't you telling me?
somebody else got him, too.
Flynn was being escorted to a transport car when he was stabbed to death by a prisoner with a shiv.
someone wanted him dead awfully fast.
very few people knew he was there.
we need to find out who had access to Flynn's release documents.
I'm on it. It's not a long list.
but the bad news is, we lost Flynn and whatever he knows.
well, he must have been working with someone, looking for Ellen's evidence box.
someone who knew that Flynn's only angle in prison would be to turn on them, so Flynn had to die and fast.
now, the good news is, we forced someone to play their hand.
and like Diana said, it's not a long list.
but whoever it is has an incredible reach.
Neal, if they can get to Flynn like this...
James is right.
he isn't safe here.
I can't send him away.
only for a little while, until we know more.
he'll be back.
you don't know that.
talk to him.
goodbye, Neal.
until we meet again.
seeing her again.
thank you for sharing this with me.
Ellen said that whatever's in that pendant is the key to finding the evidence box.
and hopefully to clearing my name.
so, how do we do it?
well, I'm listed as her next of kin, so now that the Flynn case is wrapped up, it'll be sent to me.
great. Once we have the key -- Once I have the key.
I don't understand.
I-I thought you believed me.
I do. It's not about that.
you need to leave New York.
no. - It's not safe for you here.
no, I've left you too many times.
they got to Ellen.
they got to Flynn. They almost got to you.
Mozzie has a safe house outside the city.
it's completely off the radar.
you can stay there.
all right.
I want you to be a part of my life.
thank you.
all right, uh...
Yeah.
look, once Peter and I figure this out, we can take them down together.
he's waiting outside to give you a ride, so...
I thought I'd never see you again.
okay. Okay.
Bye, dad.
see you soon, buddy. - Okay.
Curtis Hagen was granted early release from prison today.
the Mosconi Codex.
you want me to risk jail for a little light reading?
special Agent David Siegel.
you must be my new handler. - Must be.
does the name Teddy Winters mean anything to you?
they found me.
well, we kept you out of prison.
that cost me everything.
the codex.
this relationship is working wonderfully.
when does it end? - When I get what I want.
we'll find out who did this, Neal. I promise.
david Siegel. Found on the corner of Linden and Central in Bushwick.
cause of death was a gunshot wound to the sternum.
he bled out instantly.
we retrieved a shell casing from the scene.
9-millimeter caliber round from a Smith & Wesson 39 series.
this image was taken from a traffic cam in the area.
the subject is still unidentifiable.
15 days have passed, and we are no closer to figuring out who did this and why.
the working theory stands that Agent Siegel was a victim of an indiscriminate mugging gone wrong.
his wallet and firearm are still missing.
our division has dedicated all of its resources to this investigation.
but the truth is we had caseloads beforehand, and those caseloads still need to be resolved.
so the joint operation center will remain in this building, and a team of agents will continue to pursue all leads.
the remainder of you will resume your active assignments.
the best way we can honor David Siegel is by doing our jobs.
counseling remains available to anyone who still needs to talk.
that's all.
you okay?
I am. What's going on?
you got any updates on Caffrey's status? - His house arrest is still in effect.
well, he can't stay there forever if you're gonna use him. He needs a handler.
Bonsoir.
what's with the bathrobe?
the water pressure's weak in the guest room. I needed to borrow your shower.
how much longer are you staying here?
just until I get myself on some financially secure footing.
okay if I air dry on the terrace? - No, Moz.
tell me how I can help.
big Brother burned through all of my resources.
no safe houses, no capital.
what's worse, the Federal Bureau of Invasion has confined you to this impenetrable dog pound.
it's my apartment. - A sublimely spacious cell.
does that make you my cellmate?- I prefer the term "mis-incarcerated.
that sounds like you just won a prison pageant.
a, I could. B,I'll think of a better term.
still working on the codex? - I'm trying to keep my mind occupied.
and it's not working.
I can't stop thinking about Siegel.
can't stop wondering if it was my fault in any way.
if Hagen somehow-- Stop right there.
the body was found in Bushwick. That's where Hagen and I met a few hours earlier.
it's not a coincidence. - Coincidence is fate's favorite tool.
you're condemning yourself because there's no one else to blame.
I can't do anything while I'm stuck here.
I'd be better off with a new handler or even thrown back in prison.
the Suit will never let that happen.
new assignment?
the department needs a few wins right now. - Is that why you called me in?
we're going back to work. - We?
Peter, thank you, but you don't have to do that for me.
I'm ASAC. I make decisions around here, and I've decided that I'm going to actively pursue investigations.
that's what we do.
where do we start? - Accounting scam.
can we start over? - You don't get to choose. I choose.
our first case should be a good one. - This is a good one.
now, look here... - I just fell asleep.
don't grab me. I'm cooperating.
well, calm down, or I'm gonna throw you in cuffs.
what's going on? - Guy strolled into the lobby two minutes ago.
said he needs to talk to the FBI. Found this on him.
I need to confess to a crime.
looks like it is gonna be a good one.
Nate Griffith. In and out of lockup since '98.
liked to knock off banks for a while there, didn't you?
that was a long time ago, okay? I had dues to pay, and I paid 'em.
I've been trying to do right by my family ever since.
your family.- I've got a son. Andrew. He's-- he's seven.
why don't you walk me through this?
okay, okay. So I'd heard about this securities vault in Manhattan - that supposedly had 2 million in cash in it. - Who told you about it?
just heard. I don't know.
look, the more you withhold... - I'm not trying to, I swear.
what's the name of the company? - It's Kaplan Securities.
so I-I figured out how to bypass the lock system in the rear of the building.
I just went straight to the vault, and I cleaned it out.
what did you use to crack the vault?
I think I had the combination.
you think? - Look, I'm telling you the truth.
all right, look, you gotta understand, this whole thing--it's like some sort of bad dream.
it's only coming back to me in bits and pieces.
but all I know is that I couldn't stop.
where was the rest of that money?
it's--it's in Grand Central in a locker-- in number 941.
combination.
see, this isn't a game.
with your priors, you're looking at ten years. - I know that.
look, an hour ago, I was walking to Grand Central to get the rest of the cash, and I just-- I kept thinking about what I'd done, how I'd broken that promise to myself and my family.
and then bam--I get hit by this cab, outta nowhere. That's how I got this.
look, it was a wake-up call.
I cannot set a good example for my son if all I'm gonna do is relapse.
we found those in Griffith's bag--could explain his behavior.
he's got a pill for every color of the rainbow.
xanax, valium, ativan... - Heavy doses too, all authorized by the same psychiatrist.
Dr. Mara Summers.
here. Drink this. - Thanks.
you don't seem like those other guys.
that's 'cause I'm not.
in fact, I used to be a lot like you.
you robbed banks? - I did a lot of things.
the point is I was able to turn myself around just like you're trying to do.
you can be straight with me. Is there anything else you remember?
I know you're trying to help me, but I honestly can't, Mr. Caffrey.
don't ever call me Mr. Caffrey. It's Neal. Come on.
all right, keep looking. Update me in 20.
I sent a team to check the lockers at Grand Central. There's nothing there.
this gets stranger by the minute.
I don't like it. - Really?
guy walks into the FBI with stacks of cash and begs you to cuff him.
I'd think that was your catnip.
I don't have catnip. - everybody has catnip.
what's yours? - Real Housewives.
can't get enough.
money has Griffith's prints all over it.
we're running the serial numbers.
what do you have?
texture feels funny in the top-left corner of every bill.
I'm gonna need a closer look.
marked bills.
cash could've been used in a controlled buy or payoff.
or it's from another score.
is it possible our guy stole money that was already stolen?
I think Neal and I should check out that vault.
FBI here to see the manager.
that's him there.
familiarize yourself with the database starting with the client roster on your desktop.
after that, I want you to categorize this month's financial packages by date and time.
are you getting all of this? - Yes, sir.
good. Back to your desk, then.
apologies, gentlemen.
it's his first day. How can I help you?
special Agent Peter Burke, - and this is my coworker Neal Caffrey. - How you doing?
we're here about the break-in that happened last week.
break-in?
this morning a known felon walked into our offices to confess to emptying the contents of vault number four.
impossible. None of our clients have reported anything missing, and I assure you our security is top-notch.
actually, you could use an upgrade. The U. L.approval on your vaults is class I.
that means they can be breached in 30 minutes or less.
I mean, you need the right cutting wheel and carbide drill, of course.
my advice, go class III. - Could I see the vault?
we're very protective about our clients' possessions and anonymity.
without a warrant, this is all the info I can give you.
feel free to call if you have further questions.
gentlemen.
well, if the cash in the vault was illegally obtained, it makes sense that whoever owns it wouldn't want to report it missing.
unless they want to go to prison too. But this is all speculative.
it's not good enough for a warrant. - Louis!
if we can't get a look at the vault, - maybe we can find out who owns it. - Louis!
thank you.
what's the play?
well, Kaplan Securities is going to have more than one new employee today.
you still have that brochure? - Yeah.
Thanks.
okay.
watch your fingers.
Peter... - You've done this before.
instant glue.
well, it'll do in a pinch.
you frighten me.
actually, you're usually the frightening one.
you have any pictures in your wallet?
can I help you? - Eric Roberts. I'm your supervisor.
Mr. Epstein didn't say anything about you.
I have to call and-- What, you and Mr. Epstein are the only employees here?
look, I know you have those financial packages to work on, but this man takes precedence.
Mr. Wilcox is a premier importer and exporter up and down the East Coast, - and he'd like to open an account. - He would.
that means start-up papers.
that isn't protocol. - We have a system.
you better make this work. - Very good, Mr. Wilcox.
I've been here for five years, you've been here for five seconds.
start up paperwork.
third office, down the hall, left-hand side.- Of course. Of course. I'll be right back.
all right. Vault number four.
keep a lookout. - Yeah.
technically I should get a court order to go through that computer.
well, good thing your CI doesn't need one.
Neal. - There are 250 clients in this database.
narrowing it down by vault number.
I found it. Vault number four.
that's strange. It's not registered to a person.
to what, then? - To a corporation. Niteowl Holdings.
thank you. - Thank you very much, sir.
that's good enough. Go.
it's a dummy corp. Someone is using Niteowl as a front.
whoever Griffith stole from covered their identity nicely.
gentlemen, I got a lead on those marked bills.
two months ago, a Manhattan mutual truck was cleaned out.
now it's the bank's policy to mark all currency in case any kind of theft occurs.
NYPD had a suspect, just couldn't nail him.
Shane Jacoby. Priors for assault. - And likely CEO of Niteowl Holdings.
so Griffith and Jacoby don't know each other, but they're linked. How?
I might've found that link.
Shane Jacoby received a court-ordered treatment from a psychiatrist - who prescribed Griffith his meds. - Dr. Mara Summers.
there are five common stages to ICD, beginning with the impulse and ending with guilt or lack thereof.
it is that final-- This is an interesting area of expertise.
I can see why Griffith went to her.
I found the patient who experiences guilt from his actions is most likely to fall back into the original destructive pattern.
this is generally the case with the bulk of reformed criminals I've worked with in my studies.
more on that in tomorrow's lecture.
thank you all for coming.
she's got clients prone to commit crimes, and she's got access to their heads.
she could be manipulating them. - Or she could just be doing her job.
only one way to find out.
excellent, thank you. - Thank you.
Dr. Summers.
I'm sorry, you are... - My name's Neal Caffrey.
I'm a convicted felon, and I need your help.
your work and research on ICD is impressive, to say the least.
I have a predilection for its study.
Dr. Summers, this is the man I told you about, Peter.
my parole officer.
how long have you been keeping an eye on Mr. Caffrey?
eternally, some might say. - I have to be honest.
most of my work with reformed criminals is pro bono.
right now I simply don't have time to take on any new patients.
I'm not asking you for a free session.
I'm expensive. - Won't be a problem.
Peter, would you mind briefly giving Dr. Summers my resume?
briefly? Right.
well, Neal's been convicted of bond forgery.
he's also been implicated in over four dozen works of counterfeit art.
and there's also the fact that he's still a suspect in several ongoing high-profile federal investigations.
for what, exactly? - Pick something.
bottom line, money may not be a problem for a guy like me.
I didn't hear that.
my office, 1:00 P. M.tomorrow.
I look forward to working with you.
nice job.
two criminals, same psychiatrist.
I think she's looking after herself more than her clientele.
it's possible she had a patient steal from another patient, but it's the how of all this that bothers me.
you can't put the idea of a heist in someone's head without them knowing about it.
Peter, it's not that odd.
think of a number between one and ten.
no, I hate it when you do this. - Just think of a number. two, three, four, five, whatever.
you got it? - Yup.
now say it out loud in your head."Seven, seven, seven," for example.
I know what you're doing. It's not seven, Neal. - No, it's nine.
okay, how did you do that?
before I asked you to think of a number, I used the word "odd" in a sentence.
so naturally, you'll choose an odd number. - Then?
then I made your mind subtly cross off options by saying "two, three, four, five" and "seven" aloud.
which leaves the numbers one and nine.
and nobody chooses one because it's too obvious.
nine is more obscure, so that's what you go with.
that's good. Okay, but the point of all this.
in less than 20 seconds, I got you to the number I wanted.
now think of Griffith and Summers.
with that much time and influence, she could make him do anything she wanted.
this guy's innocent.
I need more, Neal.
when you're with Summers, find something tangible that links her or Griffith to Jacoby's cash.
what are you gonna do? - I've got Shane Jacoby's work address.
I'm gonna go down there and see if I can find a connection between him and Niteowl Holdings.
Neal, be careful.
I do not want this therapist getting inside your head.
please. I'm a wall. - Really?
tell me, what kind of change are you looking to make with your life?
I guess I'm looking for some normalcy.
thank you. And what if that's not possible?
that doesn't sound very encouraging.
I'm not here to encourage you.
I'm here to help you discover the truth about yourself, so you can accept it.
I have to accept that I can't be normal?
you're too interesting to be normal.
what makes me so interesting?
your pathological assumption that you need to be the smartest person in the room at all times.
maybe you're the one assuming things.
according to all these diplomas on your wall, you're a lot smarter than me, but then again, those are just papers, not people.
do you think you're good with people? - No more than you.
it's my job. - Mine too.
you have an aggressive approach. - And you're already withholding.
but that's natural.
we need to know one another better to build trust.
you don't think I'm being honest? - Not yet.
but you will be.
in time.
Mr. Jacoby!
what do you want?
I'd like to talk to you regarding your vault at Kaplan Security.
don't know what you're talking about.
okay, let's try that again.
where were you on September 4th of this year?
NYPD tried to pin that truck on me.
they had nothing. Same as you.
all right, all right, calm down. - I don't like accusations.
well, then you shouldn't be a criminal.
I especially don't like that accusation. - It's not an accusation. It's a fact.
read your rap sheet. Aggravated assault.
you busted the nose of a security guard and three of his fingers.
that's not who I am anymore.
tell me about Niteowl Holdings.
never heard of that either.
you're talking to the wrong guy, Agent Burke.
well, that's doubtful, but one more question.
how did those court-ordered anger management sessions go with Dr. Mara Summers?
either take me in on something, or let me get on with my day.
nice hat. You went to Brooklyn Residential High.
what sport did you play?
all state in wrestling. Are we done?
not quite, but you can get on with your day now, Mr. Jacoby.
you know that vault that was in Kaplan Security, the one with the $2 million cash in it?
it's all gone now.
but you knew that.
or you didn't know that.
well, now you do. Have a good day.
job. - Confined.
jealousy. - Weak.
money. - Prop.
women. - Hope.
Peter. - Worthy.
theft. - Capable.
caught. - Oops.
you make something from that?
it's too early to diagnose. - But you've got something.
your answers are unique in summation.
I assure you I can handle it, doctor.
your behavior is sociopathic.
I'm sorry?
you work on perception, the perception of others. How you think they'll feel.
this influences your actions and thoughts more so than your own emotions.
deceit and manipulation are the essential characteristics of the disorder-- you excel at both.
deceit and manipulation are generalities that can apply to anyone who lies, and everyone lies, including you, Dr. Summers.
that may be true, but not everyone believes their own lies.
why would I delude myself?
because you don't want anyone to see your vulnerabilities.
I don't strike you as confident.
confident people admit to their flaws.
you don't. Instead you smile a lot.
you're confident. What are your flaws?
I can be aggressive, like you pointed out earlier.
I also pick at my nails when I get nervous.
nobody's perfect. - Precisely.
the harder a person fights to be perfect, the more he suppresses his true nature.
I'm-- I'm reformed.- Are you?
just because a person starts doing good things doesn't mean he wants to stop doing bad things.
of course not.
because everyone has done something bad at some point in their life, even you.
this is not about me.
I thought confident people could admit to their flaws.
you're redirecting... - So are you.
because you're uncomfortable.
you don't think that I can change. - I'm asking if you really want to.
I'm sorry.
I don't feel well.
like I said, try to relax. I have a few more questions for you.
what's happening? We're using a new form of therapy.
you drugged me. - I'm helping you. I'm helping you.
what I want is for you to simply tell me the truth about who you are, what you really do, and why you're really here.
I am ready to begin when you are.
Neal? You okay?
what happened?
we began to practice hypnotherapy technique.
you were out for quite some time.
you had trouble waking.
are you sure?
perhaps you could use something to eat or a glass of water.
no, I should go.
would you like me to call you a cab? - No. No. I'm fine.
Peter. - Yeah.
got this from Brooklyn Residential's archives.
the year Jacoby graduated.
that's him. That's the team that won all state. The Owls.
I remembered the mascot when I saw his hat.
championship year for the Owls, led by team captain Shane Jacoby.
known for his aggressive takedowns and late-night practices, earning him the nickname the Night Owl.
and there is our link to Niteowl Holdings.
call NYPD, have our nostalgic friend brought in. - Sounds good.
summers is onto me.
what are you talking about? How?
I don't know, but she dosed me with something.
she got me to talk, I can't even remember what I said to her. I passed out.
do you know what it was?
no, I have no idea. She must've slipped it into my water.
okay, we're gonna get you a tox screen ASAP.
Peter, if that's the case, we have enough to arrest Summers right now.
if we bring her in now, there's a good chance we won't find the money she stole.
Griffith won't be cleared.
Griffith. That's how she made you.
Yeah, I saw Dr. Summers again.
and you told her I was an FBI agent.
Yeah, and he was a consultant.
what are you up to? - Nothing.
look, I didn't know you were investigating her.
how could I have known?
look, I had to talk to someone after everything that happened.
Jacoby's not at his residence or any known location. Looks like he went off-grid.
we're gonna have to track him down.
look, I-I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
look, you did the right thing coming here.
only after the fact.
what if I can't change?
what if I can't be anything more than... A criminal?
good night, Cinderella. - What?
Oh, it's a drug. Good night, Cinderella.
it's most likely what Summers spiked your drink with.
very popular with the working girls of Rio.
I've heard stories. - You've heard them or have them?
what's the difference?
the difference is you've been using my towels.
what did you put in my fridge?
Oh, I made some hongeo.
can you please unmake it? - It's a delicacy.
it's rotted Korean skate fish.
fantastic with, um, kimchi and rice wine. I thought you'd like some.
all right, if you are gonna live here, you can no longer cook here.
jealous of my refined palate?
I am surprised that one even exists. Good night, Cinderella. You were saying.
Oh, it's a combination of GHB, ketamine, and flunitrazepam.
the girls give it to their Johns, and then they do whatever they want while under the influence.
empty out their bank accounts, hand them the keys to their car.
next day, most guys don't recall anything happening.
they just chalk it up to having too much fun.
and you think Summers knows about this?
well, anything's possible with pharmacology.
she's a psychiatrist. She does have a degree in the field.
she's working with so many so-called criminals, she could've picked up a trick or two.
I need to find out what I told her. I could've told her everything.
and not just about this case. What if I said something about Hagen?
or Siegel? - There's a way to find out.
RMT. Recovered memory therapy.
what do you know about it?
it's simple. I drink too much wine, I forget things.
in order to remember them, I drink more wine. - I'm sure you do.
to recover a memory, it's often most effective to recreate the conditions one was experiencing at the time of that memory's loss.
so what you're saying is I need to go back down the rabbit hole?
look, even if I were gonna consider this, would you be able to find this stuff on the street?
no, of course not.
I'd have to make it for you.
you're sure this is the exact combination that Summers used?
mm, pretty sure.
one of the few certainties in life is that persons of certainty should certainly be avoided.
that does not make me feel better.
okay, I made a few modifications.
I added a mild stimulant to prolong your vision quest. - Great.
the more time you spend awake in this altered state, the better our chances of success.
and there are no lasting effects.
no, in fact you'll be in complete control of your faculties, thanks to my added potassium stimulant.
as long as I wake up when it's over.
Neal, you'll be fine. I am your Sherpa guide.
your spirit animal for this fantastic voyage you're about to embark upon.
trust me. This is the solution.
boa noite Cinderela.
remember the office.
the shapes, the textures, the view.
Dr. Summers is sitting across from you.
she's waiting for you to lose your inhibitions.
what is she saying?
I'm ready to begin when you are.
take a deep breath, and stay calm.
you won't remember what you tell me once the narcotic wears off.
Yeah, she wanted...she wanted to... - What does the FBI know?
everything.
what can the FBI prove?
nothing.
did you ask her any questions? - Yeah.
you stole the 2 million. Why?
for the same reason you steal.
because it was there.
this isn't gonna work.
I can't think straight. - That's exactly the point.
think circular. - No, I mean Summers.
she was right. I'm not reformed.
I mean, I like doing the things I do.
you know, I like working with Peter, I like working with the FBI.
okay, that's simply the drugs talking.
but I also like working against 'em.
I like doing things I shouldn't, and I don't feel guilty, - I don't feel remorse, I don't feel anything except... - Okay, too much stimulant.
maybe you should take some of the solution too.
Yeah, it could help you remember.
remember what? - Who you are.
what are you doing here, Moz?
you should be out on the streets rebuilding yourself.
you are smart, you are resourceful.
you can do anything without a height requirement.
it isn't so easy.
has big brother really finally just cornered you into defeat?
I'm gonna get a pen and write some of this down for research.
go.
okay, we should take it fr...Oh, no.
what are you doing here?
no.
I just came to get some stuff off my chest.
I was in seventh grade, I didn't know any better, but the money was sticking out of her purse, and boop, mine.
it was the same thing with the Garrido self-portrait in Belize.
I mean, I wasn't taking that out of a purse.
it was more like a highly secured wing of a Central American antiquities center.
am I talking too much?
is he okay? - I have no idea.
I am conducting an experiment.
I am trying to remember what I said to Summers when I was under...It's hot in here.
what did you do?
I talked to Mozzie, and he gave me a solution, and I drank that solution.
I don't understand.
he drugged himself in some ridiculous experiment to recreate what he said to the psychiatrist.
Neal, are you hungry?
you look like you could use something to eat.
I'm actually not hungry right now, but if you have any of those fantastic game hens you make, maybe later.
Ooh, no meat loaf, though. I'm not a fan.
honey, could you excuse us for a minute? - Yeah.
Neal. Do you know what happened to Siegel?
you're not answering my question. Siegel.
I don't know what happened, and... - What aren't you telling me, Neal?
Oh, good. For the love of Thoreau, you can't simply wander off into the woods like that.
Hey, Moz. - What're you doing in my house?
he ran away like an impudent child chasing after an untethered balloon.
what happened? - We tried something, and it worked.
he was starting to remember parts of the conversation when Summers had him under.
but you only have about 15 minutes left, at best. Then he's gonna want nap time.
all right, let's do this.
Neal. - Yeah.
take a deep breath.
close your eyes. - Yeah.
just try to remember where you left off.
what does the FBI know?
summers asked me what the FBI knew.
she realized we have nothing.
what did she ask next?
she asked about... Griffith.
will the FBI prosecute?
they will soon.
that's good, Neal. Stay focused.
after that, she stood up.
where did she go?
to make a phone call.
who did she call?
I saw the number she dialed. It was a 212 area code.
three fives... 0, 1... - Two more digits, Neal.
0, 1... 8, 4. - Nice work.
let's find out who she called.
this is Jacoby. Leave a message.
she called Shane Jacoby. Neal, we're gonna have to...grab you a blanket.
I'll take him.
what, are you gonna carry him?
I'll have you know I've been doing a lot of wrist curls.
you've done plenty. I'll take care of him.
Jones. I want to see Griffith tomorrow, and I'm gonna need you to come with me.
now's not really a good time.
make time.
you don't know Shane Jacoby.
I told you guys, no, I don't.
well, he may know about you.
summers made contact with him yesterday.
I've told you everything that I can.
I'm--I'm really sorry, guys, but you're gonna have to leave.
I have to pick up my kid from school.
just had to follow up on this.
we're doing everything we can to figure out what's going on here.
you don't waste our time, Mr. Griffith, we won't waste yours.
I'm telling you the truth. - I believe you.
and I know that you have to see your kid, so we'll be on our way.
but if anything should come up, you make sure you call us.
you got it? - Yeah, yeah. Got it.
we'll be in touch.
all right, they're gone.
daddy, what's happening? - It's okay, buddy.
back up.
Yeah, he'll be okay. As soon as you tell me where you stashed my 2 million.
otherwise... - Otherwise what?
you put your hands in the air, and let go of that kid now.
Peter, you good? - Yeah, I'm good.
get him outta here.
remember when I said we weren't done?
now we're done.
all right, the first time out, Summers manipulates Griffith to steal from Jacoby.
then she turns it around.
she steers Jacoby towards Griffith.
well, it makes sense on her part.
jacoby tries to kill Griffith, lands himself in jail, and she walks with the money.
there's still no physical evidence pointing toward Summers.
only psychological manipulation.
what's our best option?
find the money, which is probably well hidden, or get a confession out of Summers, which is all the more unlikely.
not necessarily.
there's always a solution.
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.
I got a new perspective on things. - Tell me about that.
well, I can admit that I don't know if I can control my natural impulses, but that lack of control doesn't make me feel helpless.
how does it make you feel, then?
free.
so you admit you still like to commit criminal acts.
I'm gonna commit one right now, as a matter of fact.
Where's the money?
the money you had Griffith steal.
you can play dumb all you want, doctor, but it won't last long.
the drugs will take effect soon.
that's not possible.
I removed the water bottles and poured it myself.
you'd be surprised how easy it is to reseal a plastic lid.
are you picking your fingernails, doctor?
cause that would mean you're nervous.
are you nervous? - You can't do this to me.
tell me where the money is.
the FBI will never find it.
no, they won't.
I am a criminal, after all.
you helped me realize that, so thank you, doctor.
all I need from you... is a confession.
I'm ready to begin when you are.
Dr. Mara Summers, you're under arrest for theft, possession of illegal narcotics, and malpractice.
on the basis of what?
your confession.
I knew Shane Jacoby stole that money.
idiot may as well have had "guilty" tattooed across his forehead.
I followed him to the vault where he hid the cash.
this isn't legal. You drugged me.
I think you mean you accidentally drugged yourself.
we're gonna do a tox screen on you that's probably gonna match the unprescribed cocktail you dosed Neal with at his session.
and in trying to drug me again,
Peter's going with the theory that you made the mistake of switching bottles, inadvertently harming yourself.
that sounds about right.
take her.
ma'am.
you do understand you'll never be anything more than what you are.
but at least I'm free.
which is more than I can say for you.
come with me.
so that's it? I'm in the clear?
the bureau is not pressing any charges due to the psychological duress you were under at the time.
thank you.
thank you. - Yeah, of course.
no, no, thank you for showing me that guys like us can be more than what we were.
good luck.
seems like he's feeling better.
Yeah. How about you?
how does it feel to close a case again?
I'm not so sure the case is closed.
summers cracked and told us where she hid the $2 million, but when we went to retrieve it, it wasn't there.
hmm, good thing we got a confession.
you're telling me I can have this?
consider it an apology for all the things I said the other night.
they were things I needed to hear.
it's time to rebuild the empire, my friend.
word of caution. The bills are marked.
I can get 50 on the dollar. Still a pretty good haul.
I figured it wouldn't be a problem.
this is illegally obtained contraband from one of your very own Suit's federal investigations.
so why'd you take it?
because it was there.
one day I'll find the right words, and they will be simple.
kerouac. - Yeah. Can't get much simpler than that.
not for guys like us.
guys like us? You coming back to the life?
so what's your first plan of action?
change the state of play.
I've been serving too many masters. I'm through being everyone's puppet.
hagen, FBI... what strings exactly do you plan on cutting?
when the time comes... all of them.
Mickey Mantle had this much water pressure, he'd have hit 60 before Maris.
after that, all you can talk about is baseball and plumbing?
Oh, this game's going extra innings.
you think you can knock it out of the park? - Oh, I know I can.
Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah.
you okay? - Yeah, that was weird. I just got a chill.
did you get your flu shot? There's a bug going around.
I haven't been sick since 1996.
now, come on, I'm up to bat, and you - You feel hot.
you look hot.
well, this game's rained out. I'm taking your temperature.
Oh, honey. No, please, come on. We can play through this. All right?
come on, batter up.
open up.
colony collapse, Neal.
that's what we're dealing with here.
apis mellifera are dying off in terrifying proportions.
Timmy Nolan Park.
people for the awareness of near earth objects, and now the plight of the honeybees.
our nation's agriculture depends on these drones.
without pollination, there's no strawberries, no almonds - No grapes?
is this about wine?
maybe. You have room for three hives.
that's three more beehives than I want on my terrace.
I mean, is beekeeping even legal in New York?
across all five boroughs. I mean, where's the danger?
swarms spring to mind.
although a hive would be a decent hiding spot for contraband.
and an excellent business opportunity.
pollen, propolis, and honey have been known for their healing properties since Ancient Greece.
and Cleopatra bathed in milk and honey, and, take it from me, what it did for my undercarriage...
okay. Start with one hive.
see you later.
probably just allergies. All those trees dropping pollen everywhere.
I do love how leafy this neighborhood is.
what is Neal doing here?
does he have a tracker on you?
told him I was walking you to work.
morning, Peter. - Morning.
Elizabeth. - Morning.
want me to carry that for you?
you're casing her art. - What?
you're casing my art?
please. You guys qualify for the friends and family plan.
I don't know what that means.
speaking of families...
Oh, yeah, that's unbelievable. Figure your kid's dead...
then after 15 years, Patrick shows up at the front door.
how does a 14-year-old evade an international manhunt?
when was the last time you saw him?
the summer before my junior year.
Oh, I fell in love with Europe.
we were going to museums in every city, and it was one of the best tutoring jobs I ever had.
but then he ran away from boarding school in Switzerland, and I never heard from him again.
must be nice to have a father who welcomes you home with old masters.
he wanted a lot of new pieces before the homecoming party.
Oh, well, it will be nice to see him and William, and, wow, Bea was just a baby.
and of course Stanton.
who's Stanton? - The butler.
he was kind of the glue that kept the family together.
just one butler? Very frugal for gazillionaires.
okay, I'm leaving. Hey, by the way, I'm gonna be putting alarms on the art.
no. - Just one.
what's going on? You sick?
come on. The Mortensen Real Estate scandal's not gonna solve itself.
I wish it would.
Mrs. Burke. Do come in.
Stanton, you still can call me Elizabeth.
unfortunately, I cannot.
good day.
dad, you can't fire him.
I'm telling you it's a violation of labor rights.
bea, when you have graduated from Harvard Law, we'll continue this conversation.
but Stanton didn't do it.
Elizabeth. - William. Is this a good time?
of course. This is my daughter Bea.
I met you when you were a baby.
mm, I've heard the stories.
and I'm not going to law school.
Elizabeth, my apologies.
bea spends so much time with her head stuck in novels that the realities of life are all the harsher.
is it true about Stanton? What happened?
he leaked the truth about my health to the press.
it was damaging to my business and a personal betrayal.
I'm really sorry to hear that. How are you?
well, blood sugar spikes like the market, ticker's on Mile 24, but screw the doctors.
now that Patrick's home, I feel like I'm 40 again.
And? How is he?
well, he's Patrick.
as you know, art was the only thing we had in common, and I'm still hoping that's a way we can connect.
Liz Mitchell. I'm coming in.
Patrick? You're taller.
and lost the blue hair.
I like this better.
you are as beautiful as ever.
Yeah, that got us kicked out of the Accademia in Florence.
wow, you still have your scar too.
what was that name of the horse again?
Cheval Chase. - Yes.
threw me clear over the fence at Stony Hill.
mm, and that was the first time I thought I'd lost you.
I'm gonna go check on Bea. - Okay.
all right, kid, I've got a lot of questions.
after mom died, I begged dad to let me stay in the city with him and Bea.
I was so sad about your mom.
dad wanted me to go to Le Rosey. But I wasn't ready.
is that why you ran? - I was tired of living on his terms.
you were just a kid. How did you do it?
saved my allowance.
on a ski day, I snowboarded from Zermatt to Cervinia, sold my gear, hopped on a train, and never looked back.
you put your family through hell.
what made you come back?
dad. Rumors that he was sick were all over the papers.
I came back for him, not for this life.
he's trying.
by buying me art?
it's his way of bonding. Let him. - Okay.
well, I remember your tastes.
we have Dutch masters, baroque, abstract expressionists.
that one. The Picasso.
the Homme Au Cornet?
I put this in as a joke.
do you remember the Reina Sofia?
you called Guernica a bastard child of cubist-surrealist mentovem and accused Picasso of crimes against beauty.
I was a kid. Tastes change.
you sure? - Yeah. I love it.
well, I'll have the gallery send it over.
Elizabeth. How's Downton Abbey?
I know this is gonna sound weird, but I don't think Patrick Wolcott is Patrick Wolcott.
it's his eyes. They're the right color, but it doesn't feel like him.
you think he's an imposter? - So it's possible.
Yeah, missing rich kids are a subset.
you got your Patty Hearsts, your John Paul Gettys, talented Mr. Ripleys.
william Wolcott is a perfect mark.
a very sick, emotionally fragile mark.
will you look into it?
Yeah. I have to run it by Peter, but...
how he's holding up? - I will find out.
how are you feeling?
tip-top. Million bucks.
even if he is a ringer, you're telling me William Wolcott wouldn't know his own son?
emotion is a con man's sweet spot.
and I have good reason to believe that that is not the real Patrick.
better be good. - It is.
better be damn good. - It is.
does your wife's intuition count?
el called you?
I did say you guys were on the friends and family plan.
is this some elaborate ruse to avoid the Mortensen case?
okay, that hurts my feelings, because we're looking at potential identity theft, fraud.
a family's fortune is at stake, not to mention the charitable foundation.
based on what? - Pablo Picasso.
kid hated his work, and now he's pushing Elizabeth to buy one.
you want me to launch into an investigation based on a Picasso snafu?
Peter, this is like you suddenly becoming a Red Sox fan.
I'd have to be... - I'm...you'd have to what?
I'd have to be a different person. - Thank you.
it's hot in here. - Yeah, you really don't look good. You should go home.
I'm not going home. I'm not sick. I've never gone home sick.
you're gonna have to give me more than Picasso.
also suspicious...Mr. Wolcott fired his butler of over 30 years.
good help is hard to find. - Or he was set up.
the smart move is to jettison anyone who intimately knew the real Patrick.
we'd need a DNA test. - His father hasn't ordered one.
but Elizabeth could grab a hair when she's over there.
okay, I'm not sending my wife in as a secret agent.
so send me in. - How?
the Wolcotts need a new butler. I can buttle.
Buttle? - Yeah, it's a verb.
Neal Caffrey at your service.
I don't air dirty laundry.
I see that it's cleaned.
I did not speak with the press.
Oh, thank you.
Yes. Would you like one?
excuse me.
one pours from the right.
always from the right. May I?
are you feeling warm, sir?
I am. But I've got my own, thanks.
Stanton, you're not under investigation, but we do have questions about Patrick.
do you have any reason to believe this isn't him?
he's grown, of course. But the mannerisms...
if it isn't, he's a brilliant study.
if he is a fraud, you could have exposed him.
he might have sabotaged you.
we need physical evidence. A DNA mismatch would prove he isn't a Wolcott.
thanks to Elizabeth's recommendation, William hired me as your replacement.
excuse me. You?
rhett Carlyle, domestic artist.
he buttled in a castle in Hampshire.
it's a verb. - I am aware.
how long did you work in Hampshire?
till he was caught with a princess.
suspected. Never caught.
but the evidence was overwhelming.
I didn't steal the silverware.
there is more to private service than consorting with the landed gentry.
in addition to scheduling valet and chauffeur duties, one needs to develop an acute sense of observation.
you wear your Oxfords with a luster, not a shine, lattice-laced.
carpal tunnel in your wrist, probably from years of pouring from the right.
and, Peter...Peter. - Yes.
muscle fatigue, dry lips, watery eyes, nausea
I am a brilliant study, and this man has the flu, so you might want to keep your distance.
my life's work has been protecting that family. I want that to matter.
then tell me everything I need to know about taking care of the Wolcotts.
Chauncey's ready for his walk.
thank you, Miss Bea.
there's a reading of Franny and Zooey at the 92nd Street Y.
I managed to secure you two tickets.
mid-century American fiction. My weakness.
come on, Chauncey.
Hey, Bea. - Hey, Patrick.
say hi, Chaunce.
how was your ride?
every morning there's something else I remember about this city.
may I take your helmet, sir?
no, I am gonna fix the strap.
may I take your jacket?
no, I got it.
you must be thirsty.
my father thinks people need servants. I don't.
I can take care of myself. - Of course.
Mr. Wolcott, the Times, Herald, and Guardian all open to the financial section, and your Amaranth toast with almond butter's in the dining room.
my blood sugar and I thank you, Carlyle.
Elizabeth, good morning. - Good morning, William.
Carlyle. - Good morning, Mrs. Burke.
carlyle is wonderful. Where did you get him?
Oh, he actually worked for a family that I'm very close to.
the Picasso's coming this morning, and I have a De La Tour to show you.
let's have a look.
nice uniform, slick.
the family hired a team of private investigators...
worked with Interpol... - Hey, Peter, you try acetaminophen?
ibuprofen?
the daytime stuff, the nighttime stuff?
what about the pink stuff?
okay.
Peter Burke. - Yeah, stay in there.
you're kicking me out?
No! No, no, no, just...just taking the appropriate medical precautions. - Okay.
you can see the map, right? Everything's good?
Patrick got out of Germany on a barge.
the family paid a ton in tips.
most of them happened right after he ran from school.
he was first spotted at the train station in-- Dusseldorf.
Peter, go home. We got this. Okay?
Caffrey is doing his thing. Go home.
Oh, I got my tie.
nothing.
and it's the bottom of the eighth inning...
Neal, hey. - You sound terrible. Where are you?
I'm working from home.
Mr. "No Sick Days" went home.
did you get the evidence?
it's gonna be harder than we thought.
I dusted Patrick's glass. He wiped it.
you sure about that?
Yeah. Hairbrush is clean. Toothbrush...and razor are sanitized.
the surfaces are spotless. Either this guy's a total neat freak...
or he has a reason to be living without leaving a...trace.
is he this careful all over the house?
Yeah, he wouldn't even hand me his bike helmet.
he's careful. I think Elizabeth's right.
Yeah. She usually is.
I gotta go. - He onto you?
it looks great, you guys. Thank you so much.
sorry, Liz. Didn't mean to scare you.
it's okay. I was just admiring the Picasso.
remember those guards who threatened to call The Policia when my manifesto against cubism got too loud?
and I used every Spanish word I knew just to charm them.
you promised that we would go to a bullfight if I kept my mouth shut, which was a lie.
but we did go to Tapas at Casa del Abuelo, and you let me have a cana, which was sent over by that matador who took a shine to you.
it all came back to me.
eventually.
sir?
miss Bea?
would you mind keeping it down a little bit? I'm working on a genealogy project.
apologies. I mistook it for snooping.
seems we have a pot-kettle situation.
no comment.
find anything interesting? - Um, travel journal. Fairly informative.
you know, I grew up hearing all about my brother, and now that he's actually here, he's only told me things I already know.
maybe you could ask about his travels.
it doesn't seem like he really wants to talk to me.
I'm sorry, Miss Bea.
and now Stanton's fired, and dad's really sick.
soon he'll be gone too.
and then it'll just be me and Patrick.
and you don't want to be left with someone you don't know.
why are you in here?
I thought you could wear this to dinner tonight, sir.
tell my father no matter how many designer coats he crams in my closet, I'm not wearing one.
may I ask, how does a teenager evade an international search?
doctored my dorm mates' passports, used 'em to cross borders, and then traded 'em when I needed supplies.
bartered to conserve cash. Clever.
colored contacts, a baseball cap.
switched up your accents and avoided Portofino in July?
Santorini was more my style.
is that your journal? - Tales of my travels.
looks like it got wet.
dropped it in the Aegean.
you're lucky, sir. - Why's that?
after all this, your father will take you back.
why not put on a jacket, make the old man happy?
carlyle, you are something else.
enjoy your dinner.
cause I got your print.
honey, herbal tea.
okay. And I got ginger.
and oscillococcinum.
I don't eat things that I can't say.
at least tell us how you lifted the cuff link while I eat things I can't say.
public display of affection?
Elizabeth, can I use your jacket? - Sure.
I'm not sure I like this.
clip this to your left sleeve.
this is not going to work.
Oh, it's gonna work. I'm gonna steal something right off your wrist.
watch. - Oh, I'm watching.
proximity manipulation.
diversion technique.
attention control.
proximity, diversion, attention. PDA.
it's still there.
from your other wrist.
I even told you what I was gonna steal.
wristwatch. You have a gentle touch.
Oh, oh, that's enough.
Hey, Jones.
Oh, better.
got it. Thanks.
well, do you have a magic trick that can turn bad news into good news?
why, what's up?
the prints on the cuff link were perfect, except they belong to a person who's never committed a crime.
and it wasn't common to fingerprint kids when Patrick was younger, so he's not in the database.
I could send it to Quantico for a mitochondrial DNA test.
that takes too long. I can get some actual DNA, and we can run the test here.
return the cuff link and try my technique G.A.F.
G. A.F. - Grab a fork.
grab - literally steal the silverware.
you're a cliche.
get over it.
he's grumpy when he's sick. Lean back.
Hey, what's up? - Oh, hey. Yeah.
how's life on Golden Pond?
and I see you opened the Brunello.
Oh, yeah, I saved you...Enjoy. - Thanks.
Moz. - Oh, for once I'm not the only one in the room with a buzz.
it's loud for one hive.
I may have acquired three.
skinny Gianetta got nabbed, so his wife put out feelers.
so in addition to me being undercover as a butler and taking care of Peter,
I'm now the guardian of orphan bees.
what ails the Suit?
it's that flu that's going around.
that's perfect.
it seems fitting that a man of his persuasion should be my Guinea pig.
18 amino acids packed into an antimicrobial, flavonoid-filled, honey-based tonic that will rid you of your symptoms and also cure warts, elevate your mood, and enhance performance.
thank me later. Or don't.
don't. - Don't.
I'm supposed to drink this?
one now, the second in two hours, and the third within four hours of the first.
Oh, I must be crazy to even consider this.
could you feel any worse? - Probably not.
I got to get to the Wolcotts. Feel better, Peter.
I'll stay here and observe.
observe what? What's gonna happen?
well, the first 15 minutes - well, let's see.
well, it's going to happen.
dad, it's not what I want.
it's what I want. Consider that.
my attorney is sending it over.
may I take your cup? - No.
no.
so this conversation's over.
in my mind it is.
let's talk about something else.
did you know that Picasso used to burn his own work for warmth?
that's right. He did.
sir.
Oh, this was a mistake.
it was supposed to go to the business manager.
here you go.
thank you. - Good afternoon.
time for vial number two.
Where'd Mozzie go?
he needed to check on his queen.
assuming he meant bee, but with him...
you never know.
this came for you.
I can't open it. It's for William Wolcott.
but it's addressed to Peter Burke.
you know, I think your wife had to open it for you because you're extremely sick.
besides, no one will ever know. We can just reseal it.
Neal's a very bad influence on you.
Oh, yes. - That was perfect.
Neal found out what Patrick's after - a trust fund.
he was supposed to inherit it when he was 21.
they're redoing the paperwork today.
$40 million. - Yeah.
honey, if he gets that, he's gonna disappear.
William's heart can't take that.
I got to let him know what's going on.
no. Bring William to the FBI. I want to talk to him.
I'm not sure what this Patrick is capable of. He could be dangerous.
babe, look, this is a hard conversation to have with a father, and it needs to come from a friend. Besides, you need to take it easy.
no, I don't want to take it easy.
I feel better. - Well, that's great.
I'll let you know how it goes at the Wolcotts', okay?
besides, I want you to lay down.
William, I'm not trying to upset you.
being married to an FBI agent has made you cynical.
it's time for your Insulin, sir.
this has nothing to do with Peter, okay?
I was fooled too. - I'm offended, Elizabeth!
the whole house can hear you.
this is ridiculous.
Patrick should have no problem consenting to a blood test.
you don't believe me?
fine. Draw the blood right now.
I don't need this, Patrick.
she does. How many others think you're a fool?
I won't stick a needle into my own son.
okay. I'll do it.
there. Test it.
the house is equidistant from the avenues, but we don't want him to get that far.
entry and exit points of the Wolcott residence, upper windows too.
we're gonna have three agents by the utility van, two more undercover... - Three more.
look, Peter, you're a biohazard.
I'm on the mend. I swear. And after this...
what is it? - I don't know.
Mozzie gave it to me. - Oh, God.
it works. I'm in on this bust. My wife is in there.
when it all goes down, we'll move in for the arrest. - Good boy.
come on, Chauncey.
it looks like Mozzie's tincture's working.
I'm coming off the DL.
baseball. Disabled list.
did you check out the lab they used to test the blood?
it's reputable. I put an agent there in case Patrick tried anything.
william had the sample picked up from the house.
I sealed it and handed it to the technician myself.
so Patrick didn't tamper with it.
no, but I'm sure he has something planned when the DNA comes back a mismatch.
I want to know what it is. Audio.
check one, two. Check one, two.
I'll keep an eye on Elizabeth.
come on, Chaunce. Come on. That's a good boy.
everything all right, Miss Bea?
the blood tests are back.
what we have here, Carlyle, is a real moment of truth.
everyone, I have news, and you need to hear it.
you've all been working very hard to prepare for the party on Sunday, but there's been a change of plans.
the celebration will now take place tomorrow.
I don't want to wait any longer to welcome home my son.
I'm so glad to be back.
I shouldn't have put you through this.
the DNA was a match.
also I want to thank Elizabeth for all that she's done.
today is her last day.
William, I'm sorry.
you know I was just thinking of you and Bea. - The days I have left with my son are numbered.
forcing him to do this, he could have walked out the door, and it would have been your fault.
I'll send your check.
what did I do?
well, I'm fired, and you don't have to be a butler anymore.
I can't just leave.
maybe I'll see how French that maid really is.
Liz. I tried to talk to my father, but you know how stubborn he is.
well, he's upset with me, and I can understand that.
I already took Chauncey on his walk.
well, I heard him coughing.
I'm gonna take him to the vet.
well, if he's not feeling well, he shouldn't walk.
it's not far. - It is if he can't breathe.
don't worry. I'll drive them.
I'll get the car. Good day, Mrs. Burke.
take care, Patrick.
you too, Liz.
wait here, and don't move the car. - Yes, sir.
Hey, Peter. Patrick hates the dog.
now he's bringing it to the vet.
I heard. You're wired.
you've gone from My Man Godfrey to Ace Ventura.
I'm telling you, he's got another move.
Neal, recon only. You find anything, you pull me in. - You got it.
I feel good. Really good.
great. You and the Wolcotts' dog.
Patrick went to the vet for himself.
I watched the tech remove something from his arm right here.
plastic? - Yeah.
look like a vein? - I don't know. It was about 2/3 this size.
that's a Penrose drain.
there was a case in Florida-- a guy implanted one to fool a DNA test.
filled with someone else's blood? - Yeah.
that's why Patrick drew his own.
this blood was fresh.
which means 48 hours ago the real Patrick Wolcott was alive.
and in New York. You know, we're kind of good at this.
what? - William's signing over the trust fund tomorrow.
and once fake Patrick gets what he wants...
he won't have any reason to keep the real Patrick around. - No.
we pulled in the vet tech.
of course he denies implanting a Penrose drain.
we searched the property. No signs of the tubing.
we're holding him on suspicion so he can't tip Patrick off?
you better believe it.
well, we won't get a warrant for another DNA testing without permission from the family.
why don't we just grab the bastard and tell him we know about the drain?
tempting, but we have no leverage.
so let's get some leverage.
how do we do that?
Picasso.
Yeah, yeah, Picasso.
all right, our imposter learned everything he could about Patrick's life.
but he didn't know Elizabeth's Picasso story, which proves he doesn't know everything.
Yeah, and he doesn't know what he doesn't know.
we need to ask him something that he thinks only the real Patrick knows the answer to.
and give him a reason to get that answer.
Elizabeth asks him about Picasso-- the next morning he knows everything.
the bike rides.
he goes on one every morning. It's always for an hour.
that's got to be how he's keeping Patrick alive.
and how he got the Picasso story. - And the blood.
Jones, get a radius set up in op - car, bike, foot, whatever.
make sure we stay on him wherever he goes. - Gotcha.
Patrick was gone for 15 years.
he probably didn't meet the imposter right away.
the first time he was spotted after he ran away from boarding school was at Dusseldorf.
and that's where Leo Kovak comes in.
who is Leo Kovak?
he's the reason fake Patrick has to get the answer.
who is Leo Kovak?
I'm Leo Kovak?
you are a very angry Croatian.
you work for the Von Kesslers, and you want to know what the hell happened in Dusseldorf.
what happened in Dusseldorf?
it's--it's got to be more convincing.
what happened in Dusseldorf?
nothing. But Patrick doesn't know that.
croatians invented neckties, and I'm sure you've got something in your closet that screams enraged Balkan.
I can't do Croatian. I'm going Polish.
let's pick out that tie.
Mr. Kovak is here to see you.
I'm a friend of the Von Kesslers.
of course. The Von Kesslers.
it's been a while since Dusseldorf.
thank you, Carlyle.
I followed you and your story in the papers, Patrick.
that's how we found you.
I'm sorry. Do I... - You should be sorry for what you did.
sir, I don't understand.
don't play stupid. Don't start crying.
the Von Kesslers pay me to handle their problems.
is there any way I can pay them for this inconvenience?
you think you can put a price on what you did?
that money can make this go away?
no. They want answers.
compliments of the chef.
anything else, sir?
a pen and something to write.
call me. We can make Dusseldorf go away.
but if you don't, I'll see you at your party tonight.
I'll show myself out.
if I may, sir...
that threat didn't sound hollow.
I'm going for a bike ride.
enjoy the fresh air.
he's exiting the park at Morningside and 116th.
I've got him.
I wouldn't peg you for a fed in this car.
perimeter is all set.
we'll pinch Patrick at the location.
while we're waiting, may I...
Thanks, Leo.
north on Manhattan. Handing off.
listen to that!
hard turn, 114th.
agent down! We lost the suspect!
Neal, get out. - I'm a butler.
I'm trained for this.
call an ambulance. All agents to First Avenue and 114th street.
agent Burke and Caffrey are en route.
team two has him. West on 116th. - This is 116th.
Neal. - Don't look.
I have to look. I can't help it.
there he goes.
lost sight of the suspect at the corner of Morningside and 115th.
that must be some butler college.
Where's he keeping Patrick?
he was just here.
got to be somewhere close.
all right, we're gonna have to go door to door.
I want a team on this building, down there, and a team across the street.
team two, let's go.
Hey, Peter. - Yeah, what do you have?
this may be a long shot, but Patrick said he dropped his travel journal in the Aegean.
not exactly the Aegean, but let's have a look.
for the last time, Dusseldorf.
what the hell happened?
nothing happened in Dusseldorf.
the Von Kesslers are pissed, and this Kovaks guy is coming after you.
I don't know any of these people.
okay, fine. Fine. We'll do this the hard way.
the hard way is what's gonna happen if you don't put that taser down.
Peter Burke, FBI. Cuff him.
I'm not a butler. - Let's go.
everything's gonna be okay, all right?
Patrick. - Dad.
I wanted him to be you so much, I let myself believe.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I let him into our lives.
you should know, I'm used to being an only child.
Patrick and Keith- that's his real name-- met on Santorini.
people said they could pass for brothers.
when Patrick decided to come home, Keith offered to come with him.
he took Patrick hostage, read his journals.
that man stole his life.
and now he's got it back again.
thanks to you. - Thanks to us.
are you up for some...some baseball?
a night game? - Yeah. I figured we could pick up where we left off.
I could probably-- Oh, no.
damn it. I'll call Mozzie.
wait, wait, wait, hold on. If you've had this flu already, I think we're safe.
they want me in D. C? - The job's yours.
I can't leave until I know the whole truth, until I really know what happened to David Siegel that day.
I'd like to request a book for study.
Mosconi claimed that the greatest wealth in the world was within its pages.
you're gonna steal it for me.
there's something you should know about me.
I'm not an FBI agent.
I'm a criminal informant.
all the pages held hidden symbols, culminating with a picture of an idol.
this is the idol of Sita.
the idol had eyes made out of rare diamonds.
the Hope diamond...
we're looking for its twin.
it's a forgery. It's a good one.
the initials C. H...
we're going after the Dutchman again.
I found this in Hagen's wallet.
Hagen was watching someone all day and taking notes.
it could be whoever shot him.
that's the same block where we found Siegel's body.
Neal, who's listed in apartment 3?
wait.
electronic trip wire.
someone has been studying you. - Not just me.
this is everyone who's in my division.
whoever murdered Siegel also framed Hagen.
probably killed him as well.
this is Rebecca's apartment.
who is she, Neal?
let me guess...
she never invited you over.
it's outside my radius.
I bet that's why she chose it.
who is this woman?
I have no idea.
we have to leave, right now.
she doesn't know we were here, and we need to keep it that way.
I'm staying here.
and then what, you'll confront her, convince her to tell you everything?
you could bring her in, question her.
on what grounds?
I don't have a warrant or hard evidence.
we don't know what we're dealing with here.
we leave, regroup, and figure out what to do.
siegel died six blocks from here.
somehow, he must have been onto Rebecca.
talk, now. - I told you...Hagen was threatening her.
at least I thought he was.
instead, he was working with her.
siegel must have found out about it and followed her here.
she sees Siegel, realizes her cover's blown, shoots him on the way back to his car.
she killed him.
Neal, we will not let her get away with this, but you need to tell me everything.
I mean everything.
Hagen was looking for a lost treasure that Mosconi hid a hundred years ago.
the same Mosconi from the Gershon exhibit?
where I met Rebecca.
I approached her for information on Mosconi...
exactly like Hagen wanted me to.
they played me from the start.
what's so valuable that they went through all this?
the lost twin to the Hope diamond.
the motion detector at the door is an electronic trip wire.
it's a custom job, from all appearances.
the windows are wired too. It's professional work.
we don't know much about this woman, Rebecca Lowe, but as of now, she's the prime suspect in the murders of Curtis Hagen and agent David Siegel.
Neal, you want to give us a minute?
I'm fine. - Come on, Caffrey, grab a cup of coffee with me.
she was my girlfriend, all right?
Peter, I appreciate you trying to protect me, but I can handle this.
I know what you're thinking, and I want you to stay away from this.
you said it yourself...she can't know we were there.
if I don't act like everything's normal, she'll get suspicious.
okay, but we use it to our advantage.
while you're keeping her occupied, we'll search her home.
she was so sweet and thoughtful...
so normal.
we were supposed to go shopping next week.
well, it's safe to say that's canceled.
I kind of feel duped, and I barely know her.
I can only imagine what Neal must be feeling.
I'm just worried whether he can keep up appearances.
don't you feel bad for him?
I do, but...
he lied to her about who he was too.
you know, hon, you should be a little more understanding.
you know, what I understand is that a life of lies catches up to you, and it did for Neal.
Hey, find anything?
Oh, a dusty earring behind your dresser, predating Rebecca, but no bugs.
cubic zirconia...
could explain the lack of follow-up.
as Oscar Wilde said, "A woman's face is her work of fiction.
well, everything about her was fiction, Moz.
if it's any consolation, I didn't see it coming, and I vetted her.
that worked out well.
she had us all fooled, and that's not easy to do.
the truth is...
I was excited about someone for the first time in a while.
I know you cared about her.
I cared about the person she pretended to be.
if only it were that easy. - It has to be.
we're having lunch tomorrow while the FBI raids her apartment.
if Rebecca killed Hagen, there's a chance...
that she has the blackmail video, yeah.
this is unexpected.
I couldn't wait until lunch.
hope you don't mind.
why would I?
what's the surprise?
for my hero.
nothing says "Thanks for saving my life" like vanilla bombolini.
you okay?
no, I'm not.
I shouldn't have left you alone yesterday, after everything you went through.
it's okay. Really, I...
I needed some time alone.
well, I should have been there.
but no time like the present to make up for it.
what are you doing? - Calling the FBI...
to let them know I'll be late.
morning.
hang on, hang on, hang on.
Neal, talk to me. - Morning, Peter.
what's wrong? - Listen...
I'm gonna be a little late.
Rebecca's not feeling well.
I'm gonna make her some chicken soup.
she's there now?
okay, you caught me. I ordered it from 2nd Avenue deli.
are you okay?
Oh, Peter says hi. Feel better.
uh, tell him I say hi.
Rebecca says hi.
we'll head to her place now.
I see I've come down with something.
it'll buy us a little time together.
you are an awfully good liar, Mr. Caffrey. Should I be worried?
no more lies.
I promise.
with that in mind, there's something you should know.
what's that?
Curtis Hagen, the man who kidnapped you...
he's dead. - What happened?
he was shot by a sniper, killed instantly.
that's horrible.
he did kidnap you.
still, no one deserves that.
any idea who shot him?
I was hoping you could tell me.
did you see who was holding you? They might have been involved.
no.
he only spoke once or twice, his voice was muffled, he wore a mask.
I'm sorry.
what?
just admiring you.
it's impressive how well you've handled everything.
Peter, do you want us to scan all the rare-book research?
I mean, she's got drawers of it.
Yeah, photocopy and replace everything.
she has an entire folder on Neal's childhood.
I mean, we don't even have that kind of intel on him.
make an extra copy. - Yeah.
I know you had to destroy the codex, but yesterday you said there was still a way.
what did you mean by that?
I shouldn't have said anything. I...
I can't involve you in it anymore.
Neal, this all leads to the twin of the hope diamond.
we can't stop now.
we're so close to finding it.
you were kidnapped because of the codex.
I can't let that happen again.
this can't be halfway.
we can't be halfway.
if I'm gonna be in your life, it has to include this part of it.
well, then maybe it's time I step away from that part of my life.
what?
come on, you don't actually think you could do that.
if it came to that...
to us...
Yeah, I could.
I got to say...
it's kind of weird seeing my life summed up in a file.
and, damn, she is thorough.
anything you want to admit to before it goes into evidence?
there's nothing illegal about having three different profiles on OkCupid, all right?
this has gone too far. - What'd you find?
I've got to get my wife out of the city.
I have to go.
what's wrong?
I forgot a doctor's appointment.
I'm sorry. - Wait.
we need to finish talking about this.
Oh, we will. Um, dinner? Tomorrow?
Rebecca... - Yeah?
I think I'm falling in love with you.
Neal, I-I-I don't know what to say.
you don't...you don't have to say anything.
I just...I needed you to know.
Dinner...Tomorrow.
Yeah, I'll see you then. - Bye.
you sure you don't want to stay?
I can't.
that one goes on the top file.
how much time do we have?
not much. She's on her way there now.
I stalled her as long as I could.
someone tripped the sensor.
meet me back at the office.
almost done...ten more minutes.
make it five.
be right back.
where you going?
I saw a Chinese place down the street.
gonna check out their menu.
good. You're here.
you guys were able to set everything up on time?
Yep, we have full video and audio of her apartment.
just in time to watch her pack.
you think she's onto us?
no, my menu trick worked.
she hasn't looked for bugs or cameras, so I don't think she knows we were there.
she's calling someone.
let it go to voice mail.
Jones, turn up the volume.
Peter... - We're gonna hear it eventually.
Hey, Neal, it's me.
um, look, I've been thinking a lot about what we talked about earlier, what you said to me, and, um...
I love you too.
I can't believe I just said that into your voice mail. I...
I guess I just couldn't wait to tell you.
okay, I'm gonna hang up before I embarrass myself worse, but I'll see you tomorrow.
so you told her you loved her?
I had to buy you guys some time.
the question is, what angle is she playing?
that's why she was packing.
you think she's moving on to her next target?
I think you're the only target she cares about.
Yeah, she's packing up everything from before she became Rebecca.
because she wants to stay as Rebecca.
Neal, I think she meant what she said.
she's in love with you.
she profiled my exes to handcraft a persona I would fall for...
building the perfect girlfriend.
I think she built it a little too well...
fell for her own con.
you really think she would have thrown it all away and settled down with me?
it explains why Hagen turned on her.
he lost control.
and it also explains why she turned on him.
maybe she got a read on me and decided to play along.
okay, let's assume you're right.
what reason would she have for telling you she loves you?
keep me around, help with the diamond.
it's a possibility, and in that case, she still has no idea we're onto her.
or I'm right, and she means it, and we can use it against her.
you know, your relationships aren't the only ones that are under her microscope.
you have to get Elizabeth out of town.
already did...
sent her to Bruce's in Washington until it's settled.
so let's settle it.
what are you thinking?
if she's fallen for you or not, she needs you.
we know that much.
so let's see what she does when we threaten to take you away.
thanks for coming in on such short notice.
I, uh...I hope we didn't mess up your day.
there's not much to mess with.
I still don't have a job.
Oh, well, I bet you're wondering why you're here.
I'm assuming it has something to do with the Gershon Museum robbery.
is there new information?
this isn't about the museum.
now I'm wondering why I'm here.
it's about Neal Caffrey.
what about him?
we have reason to believe that he's been engaged in illegal activities behind our back for some time now.
what kind of illegal activities?
does this man look familiar to you?
n-no, who is he?
his name is Curtis Hagen.
has Neal ever mentioned that name?
I don't believe so. Why?
he was murdered yesterday.
Neal Caffrey is our prime suspect.
you see what she just did?
pretended not to know Hagen?
her fake concern to the news that I'm a murder suspect.
Nah, looked like real concern to me.
it was real, but it wasn't for me.
it's almost impossible not to react to unpredictable news in some way.
a good con knows how to turn those tells into an advantage.
you play poker?
Ah, I host the occasional Friday night game.
you'll never be invited...
no offense.
in poker, it's too obvious to act calm when you're nervous, but when you see that fourth ace drop...
the blood pressure spikes. - Yeah.
a good player knows you can't control that, but you can hide its meaning.
she's hiding her own concern of getting caught by acting concerned about me.
or maybe you want her to be lying.
I mean, it would be easier, wouldn't it?
Neal isn't here today, is he?
no, we assigned him to another case across town so that we have the opportunity to interview his known acquaintances.
I'm...I'm sorry, this is just a lot to process.
I know Neal. He's not a murderer.
no, no, he wouldn't get his own hands dirty, but he's not above hiring others.
there's a lot you don't know about Neal Caffrey.
he's told me about his criminal past, but he says that's all behind him now.
he says that a lot.
Neal had a history with this man.
he also had a strong motive to want him dead.
which is?
I'm afraid I can't say.
so what am I supposed to do?
if I were you, I'd keep my distance.
I think that went well.
she should consider a second career on Broadway.
Yeah, so should you, Peter.
I think I sold a complete distrust of Neal pretty well.
all right, we showed our hand.
there's no way she's sticking around after the FBI calls her in about a murder she committed.
she's gonna run.
unless she has a reason to stay.
it's her.
Madison Square park, one hour.
I'll assemble the team.
all agents maintain position until my word.
Rebecca's in the park now...
sending Caffrey.
I got here as fast as I could.
you okay? - Walk with me.
how's the audio? - Five by five...
as long as Neal keeps the pen pointed in the right direction.
Becca, what's going on?
you're starting to worry me.
I was called into the FBI this morning.
what? - They were asking about Hagen.
Neal, I had to warn you.
they think you hired someone to kill him.
me?
that's insane. That...
I didn't do it. You have to believe me.
what are you gonna do?
I have to run.
he's good. - Two can play at that game.
run?
Neal, there has to be another way.
the feds could have followed you here, all right?
they didn't. I made sure of it.
you wouldn't know it if they... - Trust me, I would.
I can't trust anyone right now.
look, I hate to say it, but this is good-bye.
I can go with you.
living on the run isn't a life for someone like you.
you're not that kind of girl.
maybe I'm not the girl you think I am.
Neal, there's something that I have to tell you...
about who I really am.
something's wrong.
let's see if Caffrey can save it.
that's what all this is about, isn't it?
I have to hand it to you...
almost worked.
what are you talking about?
letting me make the decision to come clean to you...that was very clever.
Rebecca, you're not making any sense right now. What...
I didn't see the feds earlier. I must be slipping.
if there are feds here, they're here for me.
they think I'm the one who killed Hagen, come on.
there's no more point in lying, Neal.
we've been made. We got to grab her.
but we don't have anything on her.
if we don't go, she's gonna run.
you're right.
on my signal.
let's start telling the truth.
did you kill Siegel? - Where's my diamond?
tell me if you killed Siegel, I'll give you the location.
we're done playing games, Neal.
I was gonna give everything up for you.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Jones, cut her off.
move in now. Move in.
come here!
go! Go! I got him.
all agents head towards north exit!
suspect headed west on Fifth!
all units, subject heading south on Fifth Avenue in taxi number 86z5.
we've coordinated with NYPD and state police.
all eyes are on train stations, buses, airports.
there is no way she's leaving this island.
we need to go back to her apartment.
we made copies of everything there.
but we only had time for a quick search.
we looked in the bag she dropped.
nothing in it but a burner phone and some cash.
where are we on the cab?
we got the license number, but it was already found.
ditched on 13th and Broadway.
check all traffic cams and surveillance within a half mile.
already on it.
now that our cover is blown, let's tear her apartment apart.
maybe we can find something that tells us - who we're dealing with.
excellent.
pull up all the floorboards and check for any hollow spots on the ceiling.
make sure you take the back off, check between the cardboard backing and the picture.
talked to the landlord.
said she was a loner...
never had anyone over.
any references?
he didn't bother to check.
she paid six months cash up front.
six months.
she even knew how long it would take.
you think I deserve this, don't you?
no one deserves this.
I always prided myself on being one step ahead of everyone.
always the con man, never the con.
look how far it's gotten me.
maybe there's a lesson to be learned in that.
shot fired! Everybody down!
Peter? - Yeah?
we scoured the area...
so far, no sign of her, but we've got units canvassing the neighborhood.
what about where the shot came from?
it looks like a rooftop from across the way.
she didn't leave anything behind.
how is he?
he's all right.
keep looking.
well? - I'm fine.
this is unnecessary. - Just sit still.
she ruined my jacket.
Yeah, and we're gonna make her pay for that, - but you're going home.
I told you, I'm fine.
she shot you.
she shot at me.
she hit Hagen square in the heart.
she doesn't miss.
if she wanted to kill me, I'd be dead.
fine. It was a warning shot, and I'm taking the warning.
why take the shot in that moment?
maybe you looked especially smug.
or maybe we were close to something she didn't want us to find.
you had just finished searching this area.
about to turn...
the radiator isn't an ideal place to hide something.
once the winter comes, everything inside it would be destroyed.
but she only paid for six months.
she wasn't planning on seeing the winter.
there's a seam here.
it's her go-bag.
with this, she could go anywhere.
without it, she's stuck.
we've got her trapped.
jones is running every alias we have on her through the system.
I'm hopeful something will ping, give us some clues to who she is.
you don't seem very optimistic.
we still can't prove she took a shot at you, and we didn't get a confession at the park.
the most we can get on her is stalking and possession of fake I. D.s.
we need more proof than Siegel's Cooper 3 connection.
that's true.
he was standing outside her building.
then he walked to his car, where she got a jump on him.
Yeah, she tossed Siegel's gun and badge in the trash, but she wouldn't be so careless with her own gun.
what's the best way to get rid of it?
drop the gun in the river.
but it'd take 30 minutes to get there by foot.
that's too far to carry a weapon that could get her life behind bars.
mm, she wouldn't have hailed a cab...
too close to the scene.
on the video, she was headed north.
towards her home.
did you find any equipment that could have melted the gun down?
unless you count her hot plate, no.
all right.
so either she ditched the gun in the sewer grate and kept moving...
we checked all of them.
or she went home, waited for the heat to die down, then disposed of it.
eh, it could be anywhere.
what?
it was raining the day Siegel died, right?
right.
what?
what if she hid it somewhere where it would never be found?
this is dappled.
the day this was set, it was raining.
she could've tossed the gun in here, smoothed it over, and no one would ever know.
construction should have been done months ago.
I never would have thought of it.
thank God for bureaucracy.
x-rays showed something metal, but with all that rebar in there, - it's hard to tell what it is.
let's hope you're right.
otherwise, the city's gonna be pretty pissed at you.
the ballistics were a match, and we found a fingerprint on one of the bullets inside.
it matched Rebecca's.
now we just have to find her.
well, we're one step closer.
one of her passports pinged.
with who?- MI-5.
I sent you the file.
mi-5 is serious business.
how'd she get on their radar?
she was one of their agents.
her real name is Rachel Turner.
her father was American...
Colonel in the U. S. army.
her mother was British.
she moved around her whole life, constantly uprooted, starting over, never learned to form attachments, but got very good at faking them.
she was a perfect shot, great at developing underground contacts.
turns out she used those contacts to sell confidential information.
that's when she went underground.
every time they get close to her, she reinvents herself and disappears.
not this time.
you were right.
I'm not sure about what, but I like to hear that.
Rebecca fell in love with me. - Yeah.
it should be comforting.
it means what we had was somehow still real.
but it's not.
I wanted it to be.
and she's a murderer.
you didn't know who she really was.
if I'm the only thing she's staying for, let's use it.
no.
I'm not using you as bait.
you already did.
when she didn't know the truth.
now she does, and need I remind you, she shot at you.
I'm still here.
let's keep it that way.
go home, Neal.
I'll call you if I hear anything.
Hey, this is Rebecca.
sorry I missed your call.
leave a message.
I know you have Hagen's blackmail on me, and I have something you want...
the location of the diamond.
let's talk.
this is ridiculous.
indian food is traditionally enjoyed on the floor.
I'm not gonna hide in my own home.
you have an ex with a sniper rifle, Neal.
bare minimum...
we have to stay low and avoid windows, which is no easy task with this open-concept design.
I offered her a trade...
the location of the diamond in exchange for Hagen's blackmail video.
we don't have the location, Neal.
what we have is a nearly indecipherable equation locked up in the steel trap of my mind.
but she doesn't know that.
hand me the gobi. I'm stress-eating.
it was the only way to draw her out.
so best-case scenario...
you meet with her, she brings the video.
the feds show up, arrest her, and find the video.
all the blackmail Hagen has on me is exposed, and I go back to jail.
that's the best-case scenario.
Worst-case...
she discovers I don't know the location, realizes I'm trying to pull one over on her...
and I find myself reciting Proust over your grave.
looks like I need to find a third scenario.
Yeah.
should I be brushing up on my Proust?
no FBI outside?
you know I don't want the bureau to get ahold of that video.
regardless, as long as you're on that anklet, I'd rather not linger.
Where's my diamond?
location's in here.
your turn.
giving up millions and millions of dollars for this one little video.
you must really want it.
looks like we both got what we wanted.
come with me.
let's get the diamond together.
why would I do that?
because you want to be with me, and you know I want the same thing.
I know you want that diamond.
it stopped being just about the diamond a long time ago.
we can have everything we want.
there's nothing in our way anymore.
except that I can't possibly believe you.
take it.
I don't care anymore.
just come with me.
the FBI is on the way.
you called the feds?
you killed my new handler.
don't make me do this, Neal.
too late.
it's over.
you're an idiot.
we could have had everything.
it wouldn't have been real.
you're a con man.
you could have convinced yourself, but instead, you choose to stay shackled.
and yet, still freer than you.
you're always running from one identity to the next because you can't face the truth.
what's that? - That you hate who you really are.
and I can see why.
you know me so well, you know I never turn up without a way out.
actually, there are three ways out...
through the south window or one of two doors.
you've always underestimated me.
there's a fourth way.
hold it right there!
stop right there!
stop right there!
put your weapon on the ground!
now!
Oh, look...somebody already beat me to it.
now you know why I didn't mention the fourth way.
Rachel Turner, you are under arrest for murder.
I gave you strict instructions not to bait her.
it worked, didn't it?
how'd you know she wasn't gonna shoot you?
Rachel Turner has been officially charged with the murder of agent David Siegel.
I guess that's what they call closure.
look at it this way...
the next lucky woman who comes along is gonna seem like a million bucks.
either that, or every relationship after this is gonna seem really boring.
well, there's a lot of room between really boring and someone taking a shot at you.
it takes a damn good agent to help solve his own murder.
something else I should tell you.
I'm not sure I'm up for another surprise right now.
I don't think this will come as a huge shock to you.
you're going to Washington.
they want me as a section chief in D. C.
well, it's been a long time coming.
you deserve it.
uh, the job starts in two weeks.
two weeks? - Yeah.
hard to imagine not working here anymore.
Yeah. Poor Jones. What's he gonna do?
well, I'm hopeful that he will keep you out of trouble.
in light of recent events, I'm not sure that's the best idea.
you helped bring in Siegel's killer.
that's the only thing you should feel responsible for.
if anyone sees it differently, they should come talk to me.
she got what she deserved.
you, my friend, did not.
not yet...
but the game's not over.
you want to go after the diamond?
well, look on the bright side.
now we don't have to split it three ways.
are you sure you're ready?
there's no reason to wait.
Peter's on his way to D. C.
Rebecca's behind bars.
it took me longer to get over my favorite barista moving to Brooklyn.
I'm guessing millions of dollars in treasure would have helped speed up your recovery.
considerably.
so we have an equation to solve.
I must summon the equation from the depths of my mind.
I require total silence and a sprig of rosemary.
rosemary?
it stimulates the brain.
well, I don't have any rosemary.
then total silence will do.
I really appreciate the opportunity, Bruce.
Yeah, you bet.
Oh, I can't wait to get started.
Bruce, I have to run.
el just got home.
I appreciate you keeping an eye on her.
Thanks, bye.
so good to be home.
good to have you home.
really good.
how's Neal doing?
pretty shook up.
did he learn something from it?
well, I'm afraid to say it, hon, but maybe.
well, for the better?
we'll see.
are we celebrating?
Siegel's case is closed.
Rebecca is behind bars, and the Burkes are going to Washington.
is it official?
it is. I just spoke to Bruce.
I'm so proud of you.
well, this is actually perfect timing,'cause, um,
I have some news of my own.
when we first started talking about Washington,
I reached out to the National Gallery.
they just called me and offered me a position.
what? Fantastic.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
well, I didn't want to get my hopes up.
you know, I thought it was a long shot.
to us... - Yeah.
and to our new life.
we're really doing this, aren't we?
Yeah, I think we are.
you okay?
Yeah, it's just, uh...
it's finally hitting me, you know.
we're gonna be packing up this whole house and walking out that front door.
Yeah.
it's gonna be tough to leave. - Yeah.
but then again, there will be a new door we can go through...
at the National Gallery.
and the FBI headquarters.
to new doors!
b - Hello? - Do you accept a collect call from the Metropolitan Correctional Facility?
inmate... - Rachel Turner.
do you accept a collect call from the Metropolitan Correctional Facility?
inmate... - Rachel Turner.
Yes.
I'm impressed, Neal.
that was well played.
what's the threat?
you kept a backup of the video?
no, I didn't.
there's no threat, just a promise.
I'll see you soon.
the hope diamond... - We're looking for its twin.
they want me in D. C? - Job's yours.
when we first started talking about Washington,
I reached out to the National Gallery.
they just called me and offered me a position.
I made a call to Bruce in Washington.
he's meeting with the FBI director to put your release in motion.
you asked me to trust you. You can trust me.
who is she, Neal?
her real name is Rachel Turner, MI5.
Neal, she's in love with you.
we found it.
don't come any closer.
where are you going?
he's gone, and he's not coming back.
every lawenforcement officer in New York is headed here right now.
you have to stop running.
the FBI director won't release you cause you're such a big asset.
the bureau doesn't want to lose you.
now you don't want to go to D. C.
it's all bureaucracy, El. - I'll commute back and forth.
I want my freedom.
give me a week, and we'll be back in business.
why are you following me? Who are you?
I'm about to become the last person on Earth who knows where you are.
all clear.
turn over every mattress.
check behind every frame.
doesn't look like a man who planned to leave.
Neal wouldn't have left any clues.
he and Mozzie should be long gone by now.
I know it's not a perfect resemblance, but we ca...
this looks like a bad time.
I'll come back later.
stay right where you are, Mozzie.
I can explain, Suit.
I'm so very lonely.
you're gonna tell me where he is.
I know all your interrogation techniques, Suit.
I'm never gonna crack.
I'm also aided by the fact that I have no idea what you're talking about.
we both know Neal ran.
of course we do.
now, where exactly do we know he ran to?
that's what you're gonna tell me.
the answer, dear Suit, is that he didn't run.
and the evidence is right in front of you.
you?
he wouldn't run without me,
ergo...
we found the anklet.
it was in the back of a truck headed to Pennsylvania.
Thanks, Jones.
Ergo?
at 12: 52 P. M. Neal cut his anklet.
he's gone.
you're gonna tell me where he went.
whoa, whoa, whoa, 12: 52 P. M. today?
that's right. - That's impossible.
I was with him minutes before.
we were talking about...
the future.
I bet you were.
I saw the body double.
the FBI betrayed him.
what else would you expect?
you're not helping your case.
we wouldn't do it like this.
if we ever ran, it would be a well-crafted plan...
no loose ends...
together.
suit, you know something doesn't feel right about this.
I promise you, Neal didn't run...
which means someone must have taken him.
thank you.
excuse me?
I was gonna run, but, you know, figuring out how to dodge the FBI, get rid of the anklet, find an untraceable place to lay low...
that takes time.
instead, you took care of it already, so thank you.
this is the best thing that could have happened to me.
you know you're cuffed to a chair, right?
I do, but I won't be once you realize the opportunity in front of you.
Yeah, she said you were good.
well, she didn't have any friends, no one she trusted.
she told you about me, she needed you.
you're the guy in the helicopter.
Rebecca reached out to me...
a cut of the diamond for a way out of town.
and you really thought Rebecca would give that to you?
I don't think either of us expected the other to keep up our end of the bargain.
now I don't have to.
Oh. You want the whole thing for yourself.
and you are going to get it for me.
getting a little tired of how happy you are.
the FBI has the diamond.
but you work for the FBI.
she told me that too.
you can get it from them.
and what's the value of it then?
no one's gonna touch something that hot.
you can't sell it.
who says I want to?
this isn't a conversation.
more of a "You do what I say, or I push you down the elevator shaft."
you keep checking your watch.
you're playing calm, but you're sweating.
and instead of threatening me in increments...
fingers, toes, that kind of thing...
you're going straight for the drop.
you're on a clock.
question is, whose clock are you on?
Yeah.
prisoner should be here any minute, boss.
Thanks, Diana.
how are you holding up?
I'm torn between being afraid mozzie's right and hoping he is.
what do you think?
I think Mozzie would rather be anywhere but here, and the fact that he's still around says a lot.
hmm.
does he know who we're bringing in?
no.
we need to keep it that way.
Hey.
don't use our own listening devices on us.
it's rude.
well, someone has to do something.
this is the problem with bureaucracy.
it takes far too long to discover the truth...
I believe you.
then why are we standing here?
we have to find who took him.
we will.
you go home.
you let me know if you hear anything from your side of the world.
what?
you want me to leave. - Very much so.
which is why I should stay.
Mozzie. - What are you hiding from me?
of course. It was Rebecca.
she has the most reason to hurt Neal.
which is why we're gonna talk to her.
excellent. I'll lead the interrogation.
you aren't going anywhere near her.
she tried to kill you.
which is why I will be a properly motivated bad cop.
no.
there's too much on the line.
Peter, you need me.
Mozzie, you need to trust me.
tell Woodford I need more time.
I know I...
no.
I'll have it.
no more talking.
you're going to get me that diamond.
you don't need it.
or maybe I just cut my losses.
okay, you're trying to join the Pink Panthers.
look, I heard you mention Woodford.
he's rumored to be the head of the Pink Panthers, the greatest thieves of our time.
to join the group, you need a heist as an offering.
I think you told them you'd deliver the diamond.
then you understand my problem.
I met with the panthers. I saw their faces.
now I either join them or die.
there's always another way.
what, I steal something else?
no. We steal something else.
Neal's been kidnapped.
well, if you think I did it, you've got far too much faith in me.
I don't think you did it, but you may know who grabbed him.
you're gonna tell me who it is you're smiling about.
for the right price.
you want us to let you go?
get an anklet? Help us find Neal?
I'd settle for a room with a view in a low-security prison, but if you're offering...
I'm not.
here's what I'm offering...
nothing.
so why would I help you?
my wife is moving to Washington...
left today, actually.
congratulations?
she's moving there, and I'm staying here.
it's gonna be hard on us.
it's my fault.
she got a job in Washington because I was being transferred there, but then I decided to stay.
cold feet?
he was supposed to get a deal for his freedom.
it fell through. I stayed.
so you chose Neal over your wife.
I chose to do what's right.
so that's your angle here?
you want me to do what's right?
you have no sense of right or wrong.
I know that.
so what's this all about, Agent Burke?
you may be a cold, calculating murderer, but I know you love Neal.
both of us would do whatever it takes for the people we love.
and deep down,
I think you realize this may be all your fault, but it doesn't have to be.
there's still time to save Neal.
so no deals.
I will, however, offer you an opportunity.
I'll fix this for you...
but you need to give me a name.
whatever the heist is needs to impress Woodford even more than the diamond.
that's not an easy task.
how much time do we have? - 24 hours...
not enough time to scout a location and prep for a heist.
unless it's somewhere you've already scouted.
is Woodford here in New York?
either my plan works, or I fall down this elevator shaft.
it doesn't hurt to tell me.
he's here.
working out of the Kessman building.
you think robbing the head of the Pink Panthers will get me in?
are you insane?
you promised something incredible, to prove you're as good as they are, and you failed.
now you have to show you're better than them.
you have to rob the robbers.
why should I trust you?
I meant what I said earlier.
I need to leave town.
if Rebecca contacted you, it means you can provide a way out.
I can.
then this is a simple business arrangement.
I help you, you help me.
all right, how about a gesture of faith?
it'd have to be a hell of a gesture.
any minute now, the FBI is gonna storm into this building.
we need to be out of here before they do.
they'll never find this place.
you did a great job of getting off the grid, but Peter Burke is leading the investigation.
he'll find me.
we're lucky he isn't already here.
look, if I wanted to go back to that life, I'd stall, buy my time with promises and lies until Burke breaks down that door.
but I don't want to go back.
your options are prison, death, or trusting me.
what's it gonna be?
FBI! Go, go, go, go, go!
go! Go!
go, go! - Back's clear.
clear!
damn it.
partners?
someone was just here.
not of their own free will.
Rebecca said she made contact with a man named Boothe.
jones is running background on him now.
you think he wanted the diamond?
if it was him, I'd guess so.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm with the band.
it's all right. Let him in.
see, I told you.
vindication.
if you'd listened to me sooner, Suit...
there's no evidence yet.
we're running some tests to see if Neal was here.
if his captor was any good, he'd have wiped everything down.
maybe not everything.
what do you see?
wood shavings.
why would there be wood shavings?
he didn't make them trying to set himself free.
Neal knew you'd find this place.
Kessman building, downtown.
that could be where they took Neal.
it's not the kind of place you take a captive.
it's the kind of place you rob.
the Kessman building...
the offices are owned by a who's who of the overly rich and powerful.
why would Neal lead us there?
Jones, what do we have on the suspect?
Mm.
Jim Boothe... he's a thief for hire.
a couple of high-profile smash-and-grabs in Europe, a Ruby heist from the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.
usually works alone.
so we have a thief not known for kidnapping and a building that's more target than safe house.
what am I missing here?
this is usually where Neal says something.
look where that's gotten him.
Neal knows where he's headed...
not typical of a captive.
you think they're working together?
I'm saying he may have adapted to the situation at hand.
so Boothe wants a treasure he can't get.
Neal redirects him to something he can.
who in this building would have that something?
it's target-rich.
there are over 60 tenants in the building.
it could be any one of them. - Yeah.
all right, if we can't narrow it down to who, let's figure out how he's getting in.
how would you break in? - Nice try.
I know a trap when I see one.
look, Mozzie, it's not a trap.
I tell you how I'd do it, then you arrest me for intent to commit a crime.
aren't you a lawyer?
you do know that isn't how it works, right?
what's the security like?
it's top-notch... Guards at all entrance points, thermal I. D. and corneal scanners to activate the elevators.
for this to work, Woodford can't know you're going in.
that means we can't con our way up.
if the lobby's impregnable...
that means I'd go in through the roof.
Yeah, but you'd still need to get past the elevators.
fire code is a thief's best friend.
so we wait for night and make our move.
no. Day.
when everyone can see us?
well, at night, security's on high alert.
during the day, they won't be patrolling the offices.
motion sensors will be off.
so how do we get to the roof?
pull a Man on wire.
in 1974, Philippe Petit used a bow and arrow to shoot a cable between the world trade center towers.
then he tightrope walked across it.
but today's security has a man on every rooftop.
we'd never make it.
so then what?
I'd need a faster option.
bring up the image of the building.
please.
can you zoom into the left image?
Ah, bingo.
shoot an arrow from that building past the Kessman to the building on the other side.
then it's just a simple zip line down, - drop onto the roof, and I'm in? - That's right.
and I'll keep an eye on the rooftop guard from the second building.
one problem.
I don't have the equipment for something like that.
I know just the guy. - What's his name?
I can't tell you that.
why not?
Neal told us to go to the Kessman building, not to rat out a trusted ally.
Mozzie, right now we're following bread crumbs.
we need to get ahead of this so we know what we're dealing with.
Neal led us to the building. He has a plan.
and I don't work by Neal's plans.
suit! - No, Mozzie, no more excuses!
if you want me to keep Neal alive, you're gonna give me that name.
fat Charlie.
his name is Fat Charlie.
and you're gonna take me to him.
I get it now. - What's that?
why Neal likes working with you.
with every new case, he gets to think of how he would commit the crime.
he gets the thrill of invention without the threat of jail time.
maybe I'll put an anklet on you next.
I would gnaw my leg off.
Oh, listen...
fat Charlie is kind of a tricky guy to deal with, so you should really let me take the lead, okay?
by all means.
Mozzie, what do you need?
you Fat Charlie?
Yeah. - Really?
Yeah. Who the hell are you? - Here's the deal...
disappear for 24 hours, don't tell a single person,
go.
what the hell was that?
we don't have time to protect your relationships.
uh, ignoring that, that was Fat Charlie.
what happens when boothe and neal come looking for him?
Boothe, I'd like you to meet...
an old friend of mine.
Hello, neal.
you're Fat Charlie? - I am.
Where's the rest of you?
never heard that one before.
who's this guy?
it's good to see you.
you know I'm always here for you.
how can I help?
what's happening now?
Peter's giving Neal an opportunity to pass a message...
if Boothe has backup, hidden gun, anything we need to know before we move in.
Neal has a plan.
we're interrupting it.
what if he doesn't want Peter moving in?
he'd need a damn good reason not to.
Oh, you care to make a wager on it?
what? - If I'm right and Peter lets Neal continue with his plan,
I get to ask you a single question that you must answer honestly.
deal.
and if I'm right, you never set foot in this van again.
easiest bet I ever made.
let me take a look.
all right.
we're good.
all right.
bunker Buster arrow, primer cord...
are you sure?
about what?
primer cord.
you know that stuff's highly combustible?
that's exactly why we need it.
it's worth the risk.
I'll get what you need.
all right, you win.
so what's the question?
Oh, that's the trick of it.
I didn't specify when I was going to ask.
the Pink Panthers...
the most dangerous gang of thieves in the world.
over the past 20 years, they've stolen a total of $1. 2 billion worth of diamonds, gems, and other valuables.
no law enforcement agency has ever come close to catching them.
this is Alan Woodford...
long suspected to be the leader of the group.
he's also an owner of an office at the Kessman building.
I think Neal plans to infiltrate the gang.
by robbing them?
intel says that the panthers have an audition process.
that would make for quite an audition.
hell of a way to get yourself killed too.
it's not without its dangers, but Neal could have walked away from Fat Charlie's.
he didn't.
can I say what we're all probably thinking?
I mean, are we sure Neal's not auditioning to join the group for real?
Mozzie as much as admitted they were planning to run.
the FBI reneged on a deal with him.
I hate to say it, but he's pretty motivated to turn against us.
it's a risk, I know.
but for now, we trust Neal.
that's it.
go home. Get some rest.
big day tomorrow.
standard I. D. photo is ready.
I'm watching the roof.
they have a single guard with an electronic checkpoint.
he needs to tap in every five minutes or an alarm sounds.
that gives us a small window.
smile.
why do you want to join the panthers?
you said it.
they're the greatest thieves of our time.
but you've worked with Rebecca before.
that means you're good.
you don't need them.
no one in the panthers needs anyone.
that's the beauty of it.
I looked at each one of them, and I knew they were capable of almost anything, but if we could all work together, you'd get the kind of score you only dream about.
if everyone doesn't betray each other.
that's half the fun, isn't it?
otherwise, why would I be working with you?
when you met with him before, was it in Woodford's office?
Yeah. How do you think I know where it is?
what?
the exit plan is based on you walking out the front door.
if they see my face, they'll know I was there.
we can figure out a disguise, something to pass the facial scanners.
no, it won't work.
you've never been in the building.
no. That's not what I signed up for.
you want to get out of town...
then you need to go in there for me.
no, it's okay, hon.
I'm so busy with what's going on,
I wouldn't even be able to see you if you were here.
tell me about D. C.
well, there's not much to tell yet.
I mean, today was all paperwork and orientation...
Oh, and a drug test.
Oh, yeah.
well, you know, one look at you, and they knew you were trouble.
well, unless Pinot Noir shows up on my blood test,
I think I'm gonna pass.
hon, are you sure you don't want me to come home?
don't worry. I'm fine.
Satchmo and I are bonding.
my boys. I'm jealous.
I should run, hon.
I've got an early-morning meeting.
I love you.
I love you.
don't shoot.
I'm armed only with comfort food.
Mozzie, what the hell are you doing here?
Mrs. suit asked me to make sure you eat something not made out of green clovers and purple horseshoes.
less magically delicious.
she knows me too well.
next time, just use the front door.
it's there for a reason.
I'm not eating crickets. - Oh, nor should you.
that's mine.
Ah. Thank you.
sure.
join me?
Really? - Please.
Oh, I have wine. - Too bad.
Thanks.
likewise.
van's set up and ready to go.
tac team's on standby.
all right, I'll meet you there.
are you worried about him? - No.
just want to see it with my own eyes.
why does it always have to be heights?
all right, I see the guard.
he's going into the building. I'm in position.
stop screwing around, Caffrey.
Caffrey, you're running out of time.
my travel broke.
I'm supposed to meet with the Panthers in two hours, Caffrey.
figure something out, now.
guard's about to come around the bend, Caffrey.
now or never.
Caffrey, I see the guard.
he kept touching things.
if you don't want your equipment modified - for maximum accuracy... - We don't.
Boothe was likely acting as a spotter from the building Neal hit with the arrow.
we're locking it down now.
great. Take a team and search every floor that has a view of the Kessman building's roof.
time to bring in Boothe.
I'm on it.
don't make any deals with him, no matter how innocent they sound.
are you sure Neal wants you going there?
I'd say the arrow pointing at it is a pretty big clue.
uh, we may have a different problem now.
if he goes into his office, Neal's trapped.
I could go in and flash my badge.
all that will do is let him know something's up.
walking in on Neal in his office will do that too.
Yeah, what does a guy like that come down to the lobby for?
something he cares about.
what if we pose as an incoming business that might be able to lure him down?
Mozzie, you stay...
where did he go?
what is he up to?
I don't know.
I'm gonna kill him.
what is it?
I'll be down right away.
what's happened? Where is he?
right there.
is that from my car?
Oh, so you admit you own the car that hit me?
when? - Just now!
my car is parked. - Terribly.
my poor bike ran right into it.
there are laws about how far you can park from the curb for a reason.
you know what?
I guess we'll, uh, just call it even.
you're joking.
that's thousands of dollars worth of damage.
uh, my bike is totally destroyed.
I can no longer work.
it's hard to be a bike messenger without a bike, old chap.
it's fine.
let's call it even.
apology accepted, guvna.
looks like it worked.
Jones, you get him?
all right.
Boothe was already gone.
he must be rendezvousing with Neal.
Neal did what Boothe wanted.
which means he's expendable.
did it work?
in and out with no one the wiser.
now it's time to get what I want.
I'll give you the same exit plan
I was gonna give Rebecca.
I had a feeling it might go this way.
thank you. - Not this again.
because of you, I get to join the Pink Panthers.
what did you do?
Freeze! FBI!
stay on the ground!
guy has a gun on you, and you heckle him.
I knew you guys were coming.
it seemed like a good way to buy time.
did you think I ran? - No.
I figured it was something like this.
Really? - Really.
so, the Pink Panthers.
I may have just auditioned to join them.
here you go.
thank you.
how much do you think they're worth to the FBI?
quite a bit.
you really think you can infiltrate them?
I do, but I have conditions.
I thought you might. - I want a contract.
pink Panthers for my freedom.
it has to be ironclad. No wiggle room from the FBI.
I need to know it's real this time.
you deserve to.
I will make sure that happens.
uh, forgetting something?
there's somewhere I need to be first.
Mr. Woodford?
Boothe is here to see you. - Send him in.
well, you're not the man I was expecting.
no, I'm not.
I'm the man about to take his spot in the Pink Panthers.
I don't know what you're talking about.
get him out of here. Check your safe.
this way.
not the dummy one in your desk, the real one behind the fake mondrian.
wait.
who told you about it?
no one. I saw it myself.
there's no way you've been in this room before.
you almost had me, kid.
look, I don't know what your game is...
look closer.
if I really was who you think I am,
I could have you killed for this.
you could...
or you could acknowledge the skill involved, skill you need for your team.
I know the Pink Panthers are looking for one more member, and I know Boothe failed his audition.
Oh, and how do you know that?
because I'm the reason he failed.
my name is Neal Caffrey, and I want in.
how'd it go?
well, I think I passed the first test.
we'll see if Woodford calls.
hmm.
glad you made it back in time.
we've been keeping Rebecca in holding, and the marshals are about to take her back to prison.
may I? - Yep.
I was wondering if I was going to get to see you.
I'm told I have you to thank for my rescue.
and for getting grabbed in the first place.
call it even?
I wish I could.
Yeah.
I guess my list of sins is a little too long.
why'd you help me?
people like us...
we live on borrowed time.
we either end up behind bars or dead.
there's always another way.
no.
there isn't.
it catches up to you eventually.
this is as close as we can get to a happy ending, I think...
being able to do some good before the end.
stand up for me, ma'am.
spend your time well, Neal.
before you know it, it'll be gone.
you okay?
Yeah.
no.
no, I'm not. You know, I...
I look at her, and I want to see a stranger who did terrible things, but...
all I can see is the girl I fell for.
good.
just remember her that way.
after all, that's who saved you today.
before the end.
what's that?
she was saying good-bye.
she grabbed his gun. I didn't have any choice.
Hey, hon.
what are you doing here?
uh... - Mm.
Oh.
I, uh...
I just had to come home.
Oh, you failed your drug test, didn't you?
sort of.
when they took my blood, they found something unexpected.
honey, tell me everything is okay.
more than okay.
I'm pregnant.
you're pregnant? - Mm-hmm.
we're pregnant. - Yeah.
she made a choice.
for her, it was better to risk almost certain death than go back to jail.
some birds can't be caged.
I doubt I'd be that brave if the time came.
is that bravery?
there's always another way.
I've lived my life on the idea.
that's what we tell ourselves.
the greatest lies a con man tells are to himself.
but if we are being honest, she's right.
we're on borrowed time.
our sins catch up to us all eventually.
maybe not.
I offered Peter a deal...
the Pink Panthers for my freedom.
while you were kidnapped, I walked in your shoes.
I sat in the FBI, felt the camaraderie.
it's compelling.
it's also an illusion.
we are who we are, as are they.
they promised you freedom before.
what makes you think this time they'll deliver?
all I can thinkabout is White Fang and Alaska.
Alex, Belinda and I continue the repairs on the hotel and will reopen soon.
I apologize again for leaving you in the lurch, but...
after seeing the destruction caused by the earthquake...
I now understand why they were so desperate for my help.
in truth, though, my heart is with White Fang, and I will return to the claim as soon as possible.
thanks again for taking care of him.
or, is he taking care of you ?
by the time this letter reachesyou, the ice will have thawed, and you will have survived your first Alaskan winter.
did you stand it all right ?
spring is a great time for adventures with White Fang.
let hi m run, Henry. Let him guide you.
he always knows the way.

no, no. - To refuse is an insult.
there is something of yours I want.
Yoursoul, Moses. Yoursoul.
safe trip back. - You wonder why God's punishing you ?
we've done nothing to anger your god.
and yet your people are starving.
there must be a reason for that.
my grandfather spoke often of the time when the caribou would disappear, a time when the thunder in the earth would be followed by the coming of the wolf.
ifwe are patient, we will be instructed how to restore the balance.
these are stories, Moses. You cannot live your life by that.
in your book, there are stories.
ifyou care for your people, you'll take them to live with your relatives on the island.
you wear the same collar as the one before you, but your words are hollow.

why let this suffering continue ?

at the time of my grandfather's grandfather, our mother, the earth, shook, and part ofthe mountain you call Devil's Thumb broke off.
many of our people died, but in return, the Creator gave us the caribou.
Eachyear they come to us from Devil's Thumb.
for this reason, we respect the mountain and do not go there.
for two years now, the caribou have not returned.
eight hunters went to find them.
they, too, have vanished.
without the caribou...
the balance in our lives
without this balance, my people...
slowly starve, die, move away.
Ifmy dream showed me the way ofthis god-man,
I would ask my people to move.
but the dream told ofthe wolf...
that would lead us to the caribou.
and now, Henry Casey, you are here.
me ?
got the wrong man, sir.
I'm not much of a hunter. I'm more of a miner.
that is very interesting.
really.
that wolf your niece saw me with...
was a pet.
he's the hunter.
he was something.
but he's gone now.
he could be alive inside you. The wolf has the power to change.
into me.
I guess that's okay to believe, sir, but I don't.
I'm no wolf.
[ laughing ]
[All Chuckle ] - I'm a man.
that's all.
[ laughter Continues ]
this boy is free to leave when he wishes.
Thankyou.
I need supplies. I need to wire San Francisco for some money.
there must be a town near here.
when you are ready, we can show you the way.
ifit's all right with you, I'll stay here tonight. I'll leave in the morning.
good idea. Katrin can show you where to lay down.
sleep now, Casey Henry.
we can talk again tomorrow. - Okay.
[ chuckling ] He's a nice old guy, huh ?
old guy is my father.
who are you in his house ? - I didn't mean anything.
Henry, this way.
white Fang.
I should have known. You don't see.
I didn't ask you to bring me here.
I sang the healing song for you. - What's that supposed to mean ?
I gave you back your life.
doyou believe that stuff ?
all you believe in is your gold.
I'm grateful what you did for me.
but I'm not gonna go to some god for saken place to hunt caribou.
we thought you were the wolf.
sorry.
the wolfis a great hunter with a warrior's heart.
you are like every other white man.
follow the river. Before dark you will come to it.
major. - [ Reverend ] You shouldn't be here.
I told you not to-- [ Indistinct ]
[Reverend] Follow me.
Yes, sir. Hyah ! - Let's go. Hyah !
morning ! Hi, there.
[Henry] I figured the best thing to do is keep movin'.
at least I wouldn't be eatin' their food. - [ Horses Whinnying ]
then Lily, the I ndian gi rl
she walked me to the stream and pointed me here.
why didn't you stay and help them ?
why ? I'll tell you why. You're Indian, right ?
I thought so. Soyou probably understand them a bit better than I do.
they believe... s-strange things up there.
like their dreams.
they need help.
I thought I saw some soldiers while I was comin' in. Where are they quartered ?
the army's in Dawson.
Huh-uh. No, I just saw them.
you just saw somebody passin through.
so nowyou'll go home...
and forget these people who helped you.
IFI thought I could help them, I would.
they think you can. - They think I'm the white wolf.
maybe you are.
[ conversing In Haida Language]
that's him, Uncle. That's the wolf.

what do I have to do ? look, I'm here !
and I came back to find those caribou, whether you believe me or not.
maybe one of these days when this is all over, you'll realize I 'm not as worthless as you think I am.
Henry Casey.
he was here looking foryou. - Who was ?
the wolf.
white Fang ? he's alive ? - Yeah.
are you sure it was him ? - Same wolf.
well, where is he ? Where'd he go ? - Be patient. He will find you.
Lily. Go find Katrin. Tonight we do the ceremony.
Mr. Heath ?
he's just a boy, Leland.

for three days you will fast and drink only this.

you must purify your body to be worthy of the kill.
your mind must be clear ofall else, no distractions.
you care for Lily.
Yes, sir, I do.
Lily does not yield so easily.
she's tough. - All Haida women are like this, but Lily learned when she was very young.
Why's that ? - Already death has visited her three times.
her mother, her father, her brother.
all taken by the small pox, white man's plague.
so Lily has found her strength.
it is out of your hands, White Wolf.
Haida women do the choosing, and the sun will set on top of my head...
before Lily yields.
put her out of your mind.
that's not gonna be so easy.
drink this.
all the way. Drink it all the way down.

one will not return.

no, no. There's women. Beautiful women.
they're just too soft for livin' up here.
soyou want a Haida girl. - I want Lily.
my cousin's a princess.
doesn't matter to me.
we don't buy presents.
ifyou want to tell a Haida girl you care for her, you come up behind her, putyour chin on her shoulder, and you talk softly in her ear.
that's it ?
and she'll understand ? - Or break your nose.
[ chuckling ]
you don't choose a Haida woman. She chooses you.
[ speaking Haida Language ]
Aw, man.
[Bird Squawking]
[Lily] A miner's pack.
my grandfather's pole.
it tells of a great Haida chief.
bear clan.
his father, the Wolf.
mother.
calm Woman With Fish.
raven.
my father.
to be remembered by a pole is a great honor.
in my clan, there have been many chiefs and warrior women.
I carry all of them inside of me, even those yet to be born.
and they carry me.
we belong only to each other.
and no one can take that away from us.
do you understand ?
since I've been here, I've even felt that way myself.
you know, part of something.
I've never felt more at home anywhere.
when you go back to your world,
I hope you won't forget.
I'll never forget you, Lily.
I won't forget you, White Wolf.
the river delivered you at my feet.
Lily, there's gotta be a way.
what do you want me to do ?
tell me. I'll do it.
it's not possible. - I wanna be with you.
don't talk like that. - I want us to be together.
I'm LilyJoseph. My grandfather was a chief.
I will marry one of my own.
I wanna make this my home.
I wanna learn your language. I wanna be a part of this with you.
that will change. - No, it won't.
you'll change. - I'm not gonna change how I feel about you.
you'll leave.
it's not possible.
Lily. - No.
Lily, please.
it's not...
possible.
believe me ?
believe me.
[Bell Ringing]
get dressed, you pig.
what for ? - We're going to the village.
he brought us here.
a good sign. Devil's Thumb.
[Moses ] Beyond the mountain you will find the path.
Followit. It will lead you to the caribou.
morning, Moses.
walk with me, Henry.
have some good news.
[ Henry ] Yeah, what's that ?
friend of mine's shipping a load of gold to Fort Tongass.
he needs someone to help that we can trust. It pays $1, 000.
that's enough to get you home and then some, butyou have to leave today.
I can't do that. I gave Moses myword.
tomorrow White Wolf leads a hunt to Devil's Thumb.
white Wolf ?
Henry Casey.
I'm losing my patience with you, Henry.
these people might think you're something special, but I know you're not.
now, I'm warning you, don't go back up that mountain.
warning me ?
what kind of religion are you ?
the same as you, boy.
I don't know who you are or what you want with these people, but I know it ain't right.
so why don't you pack up your things and get outta here ?
[ snarling, Barking ] - Don't show off at my expense.
it'll come back and haunt you.
[Snarling Continues ] - I said get outta here !
[barking]
I'll pray foryou.
[barking]
get the men ready.
the boy's going up the mountain.
I brought you food.
Lily, I
you were in my dreams.
but that is where it must stop. - Why ?
because of who I am, and who you are.
that is the way it is.
[ Peter] Are you prepared to die ?
nobody's gonna die.
you must be ready.
when I die, I will come back as a raven, live in the forest behind the village, make so much noise, no one will be able to sleep. [ Caws ]

I thought they'd move.
you're sick, Mister. And you'll burn in hell.

very harsh words.

I'm prepared to offer you a piece of everything we take out of this mine...

[ henry] Hey, White Fang !
this is my home.
my son picked up that parcel.
my job to keep this stuff outside the house, not let it in the door.
I let 'em down.
it's Mary Bousfield's kidney.
half of it.
half? Jesus.
get it off my table!
this letter came with the package.
it's handwritten, addressed to you.
I think it's safe to assume it's from the killer.
what's it say?
it says, Mr. Miles, sir,
I send you half the kidney I took from one woman, reserved it for you.
the other piece I fried and ate. It was very nice.
I may send you the bloody knife that took it out if you only wait a while longer.
catch me when you can.
exactly the same as what the Ripper wrote.
what?
I've done my research as well, you know.
handwriting's unusual, the way he's shaped the letters.
it's eastern European.
I've done a lot of courses.
a woman was murdered in one of your vans. We need to find the driver.
with all due respect, Mr. Maduro, you don't have a filing system.
if you can't help we'll get the VAT man.
he'll have this sorted in no time. - No! No! VAT - not necessary!
I need a secretary, but how do I ask someone to work in this place?
ah - no, I have a filing system! Please, let me think!
Mr. Maduro...
it is coming to me!
the night before last, you say.
kfc.
I have many drivers. All hard workers, you know.
poles, Albanians - you know what I'm saying.
that's off the books, then?
everyone wants cash, don't they?
ha! KFC.
I told you I have system.
driver's name will be in there.
we're going to release Buchan.
no no no!
charge him.
how? We've no evidence of collusion.
I'll think of something.
we believe the killer relies on him for advice.
he'll have questions. We give him his mentor back - let him get in touch.
fine. We put him on surveillance.
di Chandler.
I've got a name for the driver of the van, sir.
works at the hospital.
have you got a pen? I'll have to spell it.
go ahead.
Buchan - out.
am I free?
Yeah.
I failed you all.
I failed poor Mary, failed the inquiry
failed all those who had faith in me.
Oh, shut up.
dr Cohen, this is DS Miles. Do you have a minute?
Yeah, but if this is about Emma Jones, you should talk to Dr Phillips.
he treated her when she came in.
John, this is DI Chandler, the detective I was telling you about.
I'm afraid Emma Jones is still in a coma.
but I'd be happy to help if I can.
we're looking for a porter, Anthony Pricha.
the morgue man?
the morgue man?
I'll show you where to find him.
Hello?
great.
he's not here.
wait a moment.
this is Anthony Pricha.
so you're the morgue man?
you must enjoy the company of the dead.
the dead...I don't care. I want to sleep.
you're 23, is that right?'
Yes.'
well, I don't look too good for my age, but come on.
what the hell you been playing at, son?
I lived through a war.
in Kosovo?
Yes.
and I...I...I see my family killed.
I see my house burned.
I am shot.
for them, I'm dead man.
but I live.
I come to England.
I work. I eat.
but I am dead man.
you must get flashbacks. Nightmares.
I bet sometimes you feel like you're going to explode.
so what do you do then?
do you go and look for a woman?
for woman, you need time. You need money.
why waste time and money, eh?
you can do what you like once they're dead.
I don't know what you say to me.
how long have you worked for AC Maduro Health & Safety?
I no work there.
driving vans, for Mr. Maduro?
I do not know Mr. Maduro.
well, he knows you. He hired you.
no. Not me.
all right, Anthony. Tell me about the work you do.
I work in hospital.'
I work in kitchen in Brick Lane.
sometimes I work in factory, but it's no good there I think.
they do not always pay.
but Maduro pays, cash in hand.
I do not know him. If I know him, I tell you.
have you heard of Jack the Ripper?
the experts reckon he was a foreign fella like yourself.
I no work for Maduro. No work for Jack.
there's a Russian. He knows where to get jobs, but he's bad man I think.
you're going to stop with all this helpless asylum-seeker crap and start answering the bloody questions, or you'll regret the day you set foot in this country.
my mother is dead.
my father is dead.
my brother, my sisters are dead.
what can you do to me?
I have nothing for you to take!
we need Maduro to ID Pricha, and get past this whole presence of him not knowing about the van.
I'll fetch him myself.
mccormack, trace the parcel. See if anyone remembers Pricha sending it to Miles.
guv.
I hate witnesses.
necessary evil.
they're all boss-eyed, with memories like goldfish.
can't make a case without them.
OK.
take your time.
look at each man carefully.
when you're satisfied, tell me which man you hired to drive for your company.
you made a mistake.
is the wrong line-up. Anthony is not even there.
Yeah, I remember that parcel.
Really?
well, I remember him.
I knew he was up to something. You can tell, innit?
didn't like him at all. He made me think of the devil.
what do you mean, the devil?
like an evil presence, you know? Ugh!
he has this parcel, and he wants to know is first-class post 100% reliable.
he doesn't want his parcel to go missing.
I tell him about recorded delivery, he don't want to know.
I say, "You've got legs - why not walk it? It's only round the corner, innit?
I didn't see why he had to post it when he could have easily taken it.
can you describe this man?
5'9," medium build, not fat or nothing, um...staring eyes, like a wolf.
he had a hat on, one of those blue felt ones with a little peak.
big moustache.
I thought maybe he wasn't English, but he sounded OK.
and the colour of his hair? His eyes?
dark. Very dark. All over.
you mean black?
I mean his aura.
so if you saw him again, would you recognise him?
Yes, I would. Want to see him?
we have CCTV.
I don't believe this. That's fantastic, Mrs. Buki.
I wish all witnesses were like you.
no, not him.
it's further on, actually.
that's him.
are you sure?
Yeah. That's who gave me the parcel.
see? That moustache and the hat?
stop. That's the man I hire.
that's Anthony.
the killer stole Pricha's identity and used false documents to obtain a job at AC Maduro Health & Safety.
the Anthony Pricha we arrested had no idea his ID had been taken.
he's a genuine refugee, and has no connection to the murders.
this is the man who sent half of Mary Bousfield's kidney to DS Miles.
this...Is the man Mr. Maduro hired.
it's the same man.
this is our killer.
I know him!
I mean, I've seen him before.
get the mug books.
find him.
I've seen him. I know it.
I remember those eyes. They gave me the creeps.
give him some air!
take your time. Look at one face at a time.
saw his face recently.
there was a picture...
I know him. I just know it. I...
is that him?
Yeah!
Yeah, that's him.
that's Severin Klosowski, - hanged 1903 for poisoning his wife. - Oh no.
Abberline, the detective who chased the Ripper, said he was the one.
we're not getting any closer to this guy, and he knows it.
sorry, sir.
Oh, it's all right.
be on Traffic tomorrow.
nothing remains of no. 29 Hanbury Street.
and this is as close as we can get to where the body of Annie Chapman was found in the back yard.
Annie Chapman had three children,
Emily Ruth, Annie Georgina and John.
poor John was a cripple, and Emily died of meningitis.
Annie took to drink, and her marriage fell apart
Oh, get to the murder! - Yes!
isn't it enough for you that the poor woman died?
the New Ripper's been killing them round here.
why don't you take us to those murder sites?
at least they exist! - Yeah! Come on!
this is a classic Ripper tour.
Where's your decency, your compassion?
what? Murder is not entertainment!
go home.
crawl back under your rocks! - Show us the murder sites!
no.
I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.
at least give us our money back. We paid our money!
here! Come back!
police have come under fire for being slow to react to the spate of Jack the Ripper copycat murders in the east end.'
fear has gripped Whitechapel...' - 'It's one week since Mary Bousfield, a community support officer, was found murdered in Mitre Square, thought to be the third victim of the Jack the Ripper copycat...'
waiting game, if they are right about the theory...
according to leading Ripper experts, the final murder will take place on November 9.'
all the police know is that the victim will have red hair and the murder will be acted out in London's east end.'
the Ripper destroyed her face.
he cut off her breasts, gutted her and stripped the skin from her thighs.
Mary's heart was cut out and never found.
police are now... - It happens anywhere, and police are no nearer to pinpointing where.'
all we know is this. - All ???
Mary Kelly had long red hair, and her last meal consisted of fish and potatoes.
public concern focuses on the lack of perceived police presence in the east end...'
police are under enormous pressure to catch the killer before he strikes again...'
Where's McCormack?
interviewing his third Ripper of the day.
all the loonies are confessing.
I know.
Sanders is on the Buchan shift.
everyone else is out interviewing Mary Bousfield's friends.
the DI seems to be living here. D'you think he's all right?
no.
I know what you need.
you got to eat.
you got to focus. You got to eat.
what, you got no appetite?
we've got two days until he copies the murder of Mary Kelly.
I've been out all night, retracing his steps, over and over, trying to work out how he's going to do it.
well, this murder could happen anywhere, in any flat.
she was torn apart. He completely...
he completely ripped her to pieces.
you were right about me. All PR and paperwork.
I can't hide it any more. I'm
I'm not up to it.
I don't think there's one of us that finds it easy.
when we're at the scene, we get on with it.
there's a process. We're trained.
but once we're on our own, it's different.
mccormack dreams of his perfect pub.
Sanders takes his kids out.
he thinks we don't know, but Kent has a little cry in the bogs or the car park.
you say you're not up to it. Being up to it has got nothing to do with the dead.
being up to it's turning up next morning at 9: 00am no matter what.
so eat up, sir.
what about you?
what do you do?
when I get home I go straight down to my garden, to my pond.
I've got a nice bit of seating there, away from the house, a bit of privacy, and I feed my fish.
I got carp, real beauties.
they come up, take the food out of my hand.
them fish save me, my job, my marriage.
you want to get yourself some fish.
better than crying in car parks.
thank you all for coming.
glad you made it, sir. - For some time...
thought you should see this.
what's happening? - as the world's premier expert...
it's not a Ripper tour. It's something else.
many of you have read my best-selling book
like other authorities on Jack, I have long believed that Mary Kelly was the last victim of the Ripper.
well,
I was wrong.
I would like it to be known that in my expert opinion,
Mary Kelly was not murdered by the Ripper.
Kelly was murdered in her lodgings on her bed, but Jack always killed in the street.
Mary was torn to pieces in a frenzy, but Jack always had an objective and he was controlled.
I believe Catherine Eddowes was Jack's last victim, here in Mitre Square.
after her, there were no more Ripper killings.
do you truly believe that?
I'm prepared to destroy my life's work and start again, such is the force of my conviction.
he's lost the plot.
no.
I know what he's doing.
are you going to be OK?
that's all I could think of to stop him.
it's not much, but it's all I've got.
there's still your inquiry, though.
well, nobody else wants my job.
they just want to stand back and watch me go down in flames.
tell me, Joe, who do you think was Jack the Ripper?
what does it matter?
I'm serious.
if you can't decide who the Ripper is, how will you catch YOUR killer?
it's completely irrelevant.
well, the killer's decided who the Ripper was.
you've got to see things through his eyes.
this is your last chance. Who killed Mary Kelly?
I've done all I can, Joe.
it's down to you now.
Oh, lovely! Oh, look at that! It's a board game!
it's like a game, and helpful to the inquiry.
we'll play it!
happy birthday, Skip.
I'll get it.
Hey, give him a beer.
Joe! Lovely. Come in.
did you come on your own?
Yeah.
happy birthday.
Thanks!
well, you could have brought a friend, or a...partner.
you think I'm gay?
wouldn't matter if you were.
I'm not gay.
no. Well, no one is on the Job, obviously.
but don't you worry. My boys are above all that.
I appreciate your openness and inclusivity!
come and have a drink, and thanks for the fish food. Very thoughtful.
he's obviously covering his tracks.
Buchan's trying to prevent a murder by convincing the killer Mary Kelly never happened.
you can't change history.
he's trying to save a life.
you should have seen him burning his books. He was gutted.
you may have to change your mind about Buchan.
irritating, interfering, pompous
I thought you'd appreciate the importance of a man's reputation, and what it costs him when he loses it.
Buchan's destroyed a name he took 20 years to build. That means something.
Yeah, all right.
maybe he didn't know who he was talking to on the website.
he's an unwitting accomplice.
Yeah, all right.
so if Buchan doesn't lead to the killer...
where does that leave us?
I mean, the next killing's tomorrow night.
I'm going to check on my fish.
beer?
Oh, cheers.
Cheers.
if you'd been a copper back then, if you were Abberline, who would you fancy for the Ripper?
Yeah, I've thought about that a lot.
Yeah, me too.
what if the original Jack was also wearing disguises?
what if Jack was a woman?
a crazed abortionist, stealing uteruses?
Yeah, that's likely.
nurses make great serial killers.
Jill the Ripper.
can't have kids herself, so she steals women's wombs, stops them from having what she can't have.
no. Women poison, or they shoot.
their victims are usually the very young or the very old.
all right then.
who did it?
well, I think Jack would have been in his thirties.
he was local, lived alone, probably in the area where the murderers took place.
he was a labourer, shabbily dressed, well known to the prostitutes, who trusted him.
he knew two victims quite well, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Kelly, since he mutilated their faces.
OK. You've given me a profile.
so now give me a name.
a witness saw him with Mary Kelly before she died.
after that witness gave her statement, Hutchinson gave another, saying he'd seen her going off with another man.
hutchinson's statement was incredibly detailed, even down to the man's horseshoe-shaped tiepin.
and we know what witnesses are like.
no memory, and boss-eyed.
he talked about the colour of the man's spats, the fact that he was carrying a parcel covered in American cloth, he remembered brown kid gloves
all at 2: 00am, by an unlit passageway? Please.
he invented that man, without question, to avoid being the last person to see Mary Kelly alive.
was Hutchinson ever a suspect?
no.
the police believed his story about a posh man in an astrakhan coat.
they went looking for somebody quite unlike Hutchinson.
I still prefer my mad bird theory.
fire Investigation have identified the accelerants used in the Wilkes St fire.
they took their bloody time.
benzoin, phenyl, collodion.
that mean anything to you?
Maduro had them in his vans!
come on.
where to, Maduro's?
no. Wilkes Street.
I think the killer set fire to this building the night of the first murder, to set the right historical atmosphere.
but he had no blueprints to work from, no coroner's report.
he was improvising, so he might have made a mistake.
it says here there were three seats of fire.
there...
there...
and over there.
he knew what he was doing, then?
no, just the opposite.
a professional arsonist would set one blaze and completely gut the building.
this guy didn't trust his tools. He went belt and braces.
he set too many fires, which ate up all the oxygen in the room...and stopped the fire from spreading.
the killer stopped e-mailing Buchan after the first murder, didn't he?
Yeah, the same night as the fire.
well, I think I know why, then.
could be the killer's computer.
get this examined straight away.
miles, we think we found the killer's computer, at Wilkes St.
that's great, boss.
so are you coming in?
no. I've something I need to do.'
george Hutchinson lived in the Victoria Working Men's Home, at the epicenter of where the murders took place.
it's a block of flats now. I'm going to knock on a few doors.
call it my eureka moment.
he's had a eureka moment.
don't go in without backup. It's a rough estate.
I'll be fine, Mother.
we'd better go and hold his hand.
Yeah, man, who that?
it's me, mate, innit?
excuse me? Hello?
Hello?
can I - I was wondering
excuse me?
thanks for stopping.
could I ask some questions about some of your neighbours?
I'm down on whores, and I shan't quit rippin' 'em till I do...get...buckled.
what did you say?
Oh, my God!
sir, you've got a head injury. You need to go to hospital.
I'm not going anywhere.
you're as pretty as me now.
not quite. I didn't hit every step on the way down.
you ready, sir?
do it.
bloody hell.
in here.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
bloody hell.
sir!
there's more.
I can't believe this.
Oh, my God.
bloody hell.
it's the leather apron.
I want Socos in here now. We need to go through every inch of this place.
it's all here.
every last detail.
is there anything about Mary Kelly?
nothing we don't know. She lived in Miller's Court with a Joe Barnet.
her last meal was fish and potatoes.
that's really going to help.
Miller's Court's over the road.
not now. It's a car park.
well, what do you want me to say?
all we know is he's going to rip her apart in her flat, on her bed, and recreate what happened
the victim will have long red hair?
Yeah.
well, I think I've found her.
I've seen her before. She's a nurse from the hospital.
get her ID'd and under protection. Go. Now.
there must be something amongst all this that tells us who the guy is.
excuse me, love?
excuse me. Do you know this woman? I need to find her.
physician, Aesclepius, who enraged the gods by bringing a dead man back to life.'
as punishment for this manmade miracle, Zeus killed Aesclepius...
but from respect for his ability, placed the dead physician's soul amongst the stars...'
Oh, this is a nightmare.
there are dozens of birth certificates.
one of them must be his.
I don't recognise any names.
Yeah. Kent?
her name is Frances Coles. She's a midwife.
they've ID'd her.
Frances Coles, a midwife.
have they made contact?
have you made contact?
she's not answering.' - He can't get her on the phone.
her address is Clerkenwell Rd...'
they've got an address.
send a tactical unit.
get Tactical. We'll meet you there.
No! We need to find HIM. The answer must be here somewhere.
the last murder will be tonight. Something must point to who he is.
these are obviously false identities.
I think the real man disappeared years ago, and we're left with this.
as far as we're concerned, he's an unidentified person.
a John Doe.
John Doe? Oh my God!
you know what the police called a John Doe of Jewish origin in 1888?
what?
who's David Cohen?
dr David Cohen!
we can postpone if you like.
no, don't be silly. Come in.
sit down. Make yourself at home.
I don't want to be alone tonight, anyway.
Where's John?
couldn't get away from A&E.
Ah. Typical.
he said to say sorry.
he wanted me to really look after you.
I really hope you like fish pie.
I love it.
Yeah.
we're just about to go in now, sir.
they're going in.
that was wonderful. Thank you.
great. I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Where's your bathroom?
it's through the bedroom and on the left.
I hope you like ice cream.
any thoughts on music?
clear.
clear? Clear.
all clear, boss.
shit.
she's not here.
what do you mean?
the flat's empty.
search the flat for anything that might tell us where she is.
mum, dad, brothers, sisters, boyfriends - whatever.
I want every address within a five-minute walk of where I am now.
she's close, I know it. Just round the corner, just like Mary Kelly.
we need to look for an address where she might be. Go!
Yes, yes, yes! Kent!
got an address book, sir.
an address book.
Somerford St?
no. No, no. Nearer.
how about Leonard St?
Leonard St? - It's miles away.
nearer than that!
hutchinson lived a stone's throw from Mary Kelly.
the address must be a street away. 'Like Wentworth St?'
Wentworth or Dawes St. It's as near as that.
come on, we're running out of time.
if we get this wrong, she's dead.
I've got one. Got one.
hang on a sec.
it's Bethnal Green. Sorry.
come here, you bitch!
I've found one. Could be a boyfriend, really close.
a man called John Phillips, 237 Chapel Wharf Buildings,
flower and Dean St.
flower and Dean. Spot on. Got it!
how do you know she's going to be there?
I know him now. This is what he wants.
I can feel it, Miles. Trust me.
all right.
dr Phillips's flat.
237. Fifth floor.
who are you?
gotcha, you bastard!
check the girl. I'm all right.
check the girl.
are you all right?
are you sure?
miles, she's fine.
she's fine...
emergency assistance required. DS Miles is down.
suspect on the run. He's wearing scrubs.
it's OK. Just...just hang on. Please.
just hang on.
OK. You're going to be OK.
you've failed.
with due respect, sir, I saved two lives.
that lunatic is still free. How long till he kills again?
what atrocities are still to come?
he won't kill again.
why should he stop?
we don't even know who he is.
we know nothing about his real identity.
9 November is over. He doesn't get another chance to kill a Mary Kelly.
he's failed. Nothing left to live for.
he'll want to die and preserve his anonymity.
he wants to be a myth, like the first Jack.
I think if we monitor suicides in the capital over the next two weeks, he'll turn up.
well, it's not your call any more.
you could have been great. We had such ambition for you.
but now...
I'm going to have to cut you loose.
nothing but a DI.
thank you.
your mother said I'd find you here.
Hello, Joe.
how are you, Ed?
I have to know.
you looked into his eyes.
what was he like?
he was just a man.
and I'm always amazed at the evil men do.
will you drink to her?
Yes, of course.
to you, Mary.
what will you do now?
Oh, my investigating days are not over.
wherever there's a mystery, the unexplained, the whiff of conspiracy,
I'll be there.
I'm sure you're the right man for the job.
join me.
we'd make a great team.
boss!
we gotta go!
would you like a lift?
no, no no. You're very kind, but I prefer the bus.
you see all of human life that way.
it's not all serial killers and car chases and saving the girl, you know.
I know that.
gangland murder. Drug-related. Domestic. Aggravated burglary.
knock on the head for no reason on a Friday night - Whitechapel.
you up for that?
I'm here, aren't I?
two tea bags and milk, Skip.
green tea, sir.
want a biscuit?
they're whole wheat.
help you think.
all right, what have we got?
stab wound to the chest. Looks like a mugging gone bad.
it might be.
perhaps the killer wants us to dismiss it as a random attack, so we don't dig any deeper.
Oh, don't start.
don't you have a nice desk to go to?
no, I don't. Let's go.
I mean, with the greatest respect, nine times out of ten, if it looks like a mugging, it's a mugging.
and if it looks like a domestic, it's a domestic.
but it wasn't last time, was it?
no, fair enough, but the exception proves the rule. And if this is an exception?
the capital is safer now than it has ever been.
there's nothing to do. I'm inert.
so, what have you got for me? - Something gruesome ??
but you know what we've got here, don't you?
another copy cat.
a crazed Kray fan.
who's he? - Stephen Dukes.
this is out of control. Needs to be reigned in.
know about his background? Ask him about his father.
miles? - Ask him about Freddie The Dip.
this isn't part of a crime ring with villains resurrected from the 60s.
the legend promises that one day Ron and Reg will return.
resurrected. - I'm not afraid of ghosts.
I am.
he's obviously not...
what do you think?
I think you're gonna need another whiteboard.
this is exactly the same as in 1966.
Ronnie Kray was thirsting for blood.
george Cornell was sitting right there drinking a light ale when Ronnie came in and shot him in the head.
our victim was a lager man.
two warning shots fired to clear everyone out and he gets a bullet in the head.
the only witness to the Cornell murder in '66 was the barmaid.
and she went into witness protection. They can't get her.
what did Billy Bunhill do 40 years ago to deserve this?
and who waits that long to take revenge?
barmaid so everything but wouldn't talk.
a stroll through history!
she wouldn't talk to me but she said she'd talk to you.
look, I saw Jimmy Kray, all right?
Jimmy Kray shot him.
what are you waiting for?
he only lives round the corner!
move into position.
OK. Go!
compromised. Compromised.
don't just stand their gawping.
Jimmy's expecting ya.
the builder who fixed the ceiling in the incident room!
how's your boy?
still got a sore arse, has he?
arrest him and get him out of here. - Hang on.
gotta say my goodbyes.
be back in time for dinner, love.
OK?
come on.
gentlemen.
he was here all night so whatever you think he did, he didn't.
Jimmy Kray. Come on.
everyone knows there aren't any more Krays. They're all dead.
he's a Kray all right.
every time I do the Karaoke, I call myself Elvis.
but it don't make me the King.
I can prove it.
I used to write to Ronnie Kray when he was in prison.
he invited me to visit him so I did for a couple of years.
then one day he was talking about how he wanted an heir.
a son to carry on the legend.
I offered to help.
Ronnie Kray was a misogynistic homosexual who thought all women were dirty.
how could you get pregnant?
because he'd kept a deposit in a special type of bank.
if you know what I mean.
and I made a withdrawal.
there's no father's name.
because the father has to be present to register the birth.
he could hardly do that from prison, could he?
you had Ronnie Kray's son and no-one knew until now?
I had to keep it a secret till they was old enough to look after themselves.
on account of people like you.
and others that would see harm done to 'em.
themselves?
how many Krays did you have?
just my twins.
two perfect boys.
you believe her story? - Yeah.
the legend said there was a sperm bank.
storing the legacy of Ron and Reg waiting for the day.
it was a scary bedtime story for East End kids.
you had a panic attack when you thought it was a copy cat.
you're fine with it being the real Krays.
I'd rather die a lion than live like a mouse.
Really?
well, not the dying part. But you know what I mean.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray. What a pair.
what do you know about them?
they surfaced recently swearing they are Ronnie Kray's sons.
promising to take back the East End but it's all bluff.
they're just trading on their father's name.
so they are genuine? The real thing?
real in body but not in spirit.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are only interested in the glamour of the gangster lifestyle.
they are celebrity offspring who lack the talent and wit of their father.
I have a witness who says Jimmy shot a man dead.
a witness who is probably 50 richer for giving you Jimmy's name.
why would anyone pay a witness to say they committed murder?
when you are as useless as Jimmy and Johnny Kray, the only thing you can steal is credit.
if they can get arrested for murder, it makes them look good.
you won't be able to charge and they'll walk free but with bigger reputations.
no.
they are their father's sons. And they are revenging him.
they attacked one of my detectives and infiltrated my offices.
they've turned half the uniforms against me.
I'm not the kind of man who starts a fight but I won't walk away from one.
you're making them into what they want to be.
you're falling for the fantasy they've created.
be careful, Joe.
your career won't survive another error of judgement.
he's not leaving that cell let alone this station!
I mean, look at you in your tailored suit and gold watch!
it's clear what you are in this business for.
you are holding my client without basis. He should be released.
to cause more mayhem?! More murders for us to mop up?!
calm down before you hurt yourself. - Jimmy Kray's solicitor.
and I believe that he should be released immediately.
why would we do that? - My client is an identical twin.
she does not know whether she saw Jimmy Kray,
Johnny Kray or Mickey Mouse.
Jimmy shot a man in front of her.
she knows what she saw. - Really?
why not ask her to tell them apart?
fine. We shall. - If she can't, you will concede you do not know who committed the crime and you will free my client.
we weren't expecting you back so soon.
I heard you made an arrest. I wanna see who did this to me.
now remember. This ain't a line-up.
all you have to do is look at Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
and pick Jimmy.
Yeah.
the one that shot Billy Bunhill.
right?
two perfect boys.
she couldn't do it.
I couldn't tell 'em apart. I don't think their mother can.
so that's it? They're free?
if our only witness is unreliable, we can't hold them.
this way, boys.
come on, Jimmy.
you'll never be this lucky again.
consider this a war, gentlemen! - A war?
Oh, we love ourselves a war, - Don't we, Johnny? - Oh, we do.
we do.
this liver's all scar tissue.
Mr. Bunhill was quite the drinker.
the bullet's gone to ballistics. I'll let you know.
it'll be from a Luger. Ronnie's favourite gun.
is there any DNA to prove which twin was responsible?
well, no.
twins are basically two halves of the same person.
so not only do they look the same but they share the same DNA.
forensics can't help us, then? - I'm afraid not.
you'll have to do this one the old-fashioned way.
witnesses. Confessions. And luck.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are prime suspects in the murder of Lennie Cobb,
slasher Daneford and Billy Bunhill.
what about Stephen Dukes?
dukes is no longer of primary interest.
now Lennie Cobb and Slasher Daneford were witnesses against Ron and Reg.
their deaths were revenge. Billy Bunhill...
we haven't found the link between him and Ronnie and Reggie.
this board is blank.
I want to know everything there is to know about Jimmy and Johnny
friends, associates, business interests.
I want it all, down to the smallest detail, in the next 48 hours.
the builder who fixed the ceiling was Jimmy, Johnny or both.
how would they have got in? - The job would have been put out to tender.
then it would have been authorised.
nothing happens without forms filled in triplicate.
follow the paper trail. See whose signature is on it.
sir.
ed. It's me. Joe.
I can see you, Ed. Open the door.
are you alone? - Yes.
were you followed? - No.
now let me in. This is ridiculous.
quickly! They may have a bead on you.
not much to offer you by the way of sustenance, I'm afraid.
haven't been out to the shops much since Slasher's murder.
mum has some fruit teas. Past their sell-by.
it's all a bit last resort here now. - I'm fine.
have you thought about opening a window? - No!
no, I'm staying away from the windows.
I'm not answering the phone either.
these people are killers.
I can't be too careful.
I'm sure they have no interest in harming you.
I was warned!
they gave me Slasher's lighter to show they know who I am.
I can't be part of this investigation any more! I quit!
it's over for me.
if the Krays have a hit list, I've put myself at the top of it.
you must try and relax.
this is all I have by way of research on the Krays.
I had to swat up for the documentary and all my notes are there.
take it. I'm washing my hands of it all.
the detective who caught the Krays, Nipper Read, said it was attention to detail that was the key to making the arrests.
I'm willing to bet you already have the answer you just haven't realised it yet.
you must look at everything again very...VERY closely.
the key is there.
ha! Not another word from me.
ever.
Thanks.
you know, a gang is like any other business.
you start at the bottom and you work your way up to the top.
you can't just walk in and be chief executive.
I'm sure the Kray name opened doors. - Still.
it's a closed world. Invitation only.
someone will have vouched for those boys when they were coming up.
like Dickie Morgan did for Ronnie and Reggie?
Yeah. The King maker.
it's a good idea. Put it on the board.
legibly.
Hello, son. How are you? You on the mend?
Yeah, I'm much better thanks.
that's great. How can I help you?
what do you need?
an ergonomic chair? I can request that for you.
no, thanks.
I'm looking for the records on the builder who did the work in the incident room.
the leaky roof? - Stuff like who hired him.
bad job, was it?
these things are put out for tender, you know.
you get the cheapest which is not always the best.
no authorisation form.
no invoice either.
must have got lost in the system. It'll turn up sooner or later.
I'll put a flag on it.
all right. Thanks. I'll see you in a few days.
weeks more like.
you look after yourself.
out of the way, lads.
Cheers.
you leave him alone. That paperwork'll never turn up.
hello.
no.
here. Have a look at this.
no.
found something, boss!
what have you got? - I've found something that proves
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are managing directors of Multiple Investments.
here's a list of the business they own.
chinese restaurants.
some Turkish places in Green Lanes. And a Russian tea room.
all these are a front.
for what?
Ronnie Kray wanted to create the federation of crime.
the idea was to have all the gangs working together instead of competing.
they pool expertise and their combined strength would make them unstoppable.
what we have is the new federation of crime.
all these restaurants represent a gang - the Russians, Triads, Turkish.
all under the control of Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
they're on their way to realising their father's dream.
what's on your mind?
I was just thinking. When my dad disappeared.
if it'd been investigated properly, we may have found out what happened.
he just wasn't important enough.
what are you doing?
now get in the car. - You can't just take me.
go!
di Chandler. You made it.
please.
I'm Johnny. This is my brother Jimmy.
what do you want?
well, we need to come to an understanding.
an accommodation. You know. This is a small town.
and we all need to learn to get along.
stop stepping on each other's toes.
what do you suggest?
me and my brother are businessmen.
we work with the local community and we'd like to continue to grow our business.
and you will carry on being a policeman.
that's what I am doing.
but you're the wrong sort of policeman.
you mean the sort who investigates you.
I'm afraid I'm the kind of man who doesn't care what people think.
I'm the one who marches out of time.
so even if you get every police in London in line, you won't get me.
well, you've made your point perfectly clear.
now I'm gonna make mine.
disappear.
take a holiday. - Or what?
you're not gonna play funny buggers with us, are you?
well, get him out of here.
how mad is he?
mad enough to shoot a man for sitting on the wrong bar stool.
Billy Bunhill was a total innocent.
a nobody. He was just unlucky.
wait. Before we go any further,
I need to you register as a covert intelligence source.
I don't think so. I am a snout.
and that is all, officially, there is to know.
well, I'm afraid I can't use you.
or have anything more to do with you.
this investigation has to be by the book.
that's a shame. For you.
I was gonna tell you about the Congo. - What?
Why? What's in the bloody Congo?
mercenaries.
I have a job for you. - I made myself clear. Go away!
come on, Ed. It's urgent.
I need you to find out about Miles's father Freddie The Dip.
nothing is more important than finding the truth.
do not tempt me.
you'll be safe. You'll only have to worry about the ghosts.
come on. This is the siren call of detection, remember?
boss, we've looked.
but we can't find anything to connect Billy Bunhill to the Krays.
ever. Nothing. - And you won't find anything.
Billy Bunhill was a random bloke who fancied a pint and sat on the wrong bar stool.
when Jimmy walked in, he was gonna shoot whoever was there because that is where George Cornell sat. ??
the motive wasn't revenge like the others? - ?? It was madness.
I had a meeting with Jimmy and Johnny.
are you serious?
I think Johnny is relatively normal. He's the businessman.
he wants to run the Federation of Crime. ?
but Jimmy's completely insane. - Like father like son.
when Ronnie went paranoid, the murder count shot up.
he called himself The Colonel and plotted to eliminate his enemies.
it's been made clear to me that we are the enemies now.
Jimmy and Johnny spent time in the Congo as mercenaries.
find out when, for how long and who they fought with.
I'll start straightaway.
get on the ball, Liam!!
give a go, Liam! Give a go!
good boy. - He's got a good left foot.
Yeah, it's not bad. He's not consistent, though.
he's got natural ability. - Yeah. Maybe.
had a bit of interest of the clubs. - Really?
which one is your son?
Oh, I haven't got a boy here. I've just come to have a good look at yours.
what are you? A scout? - No.
who are you, then?
I'm the man that'll break Liam's legs if you don't behave.
Liam. Sorry, ref.
you'll have to get a sub on. He's coming with me.
come on. I'll get you home.
there must be a way to stop...
you reflect in your eyes I just don't know how to...
Oi! McCormack!
to be with somebody new...
Oh, there must be a way!
bang. You're dead.
without you
you.
you did this?
you were told to go on holiday but you didn't.
I made sure they didn't kill you.
here.
you can't afford to lose this war.
what is this? - Ammunition
think of it as you're last stand.
Now...Shall I show you how to get out of here?
I just wanted to ask you.
how did you become Mad Danny The Disposer?
I had a big boot on my car.
I wasn't squeamish either.
so it just sort of fell to me.
I wasn't killing no-one. I was a kind of...
caretaker.
where did you take the bodies?
I like working in the countryside.
pig farms?
Yeah. I'd chop the body up. Joint it really.
freeze it then put the parts through a wood chipper.
you get a good slurry you can feed to the pigs. They love it.
why did you freeze them?
it's practical. Cuts down on the splatter.
I've been asking around all my old contacts but people seem very reluctant to talk this time.
it ain't reluctant. Nobody knows.
hardly anyone knows what happened to Freddie The Dip.
you do.
well, I know that Ron invited Freddie to go fishing.
freddie thought he was being stepped up.
when they got there, Ron had him shot in the head.
Why? Why would he do such a thing?
I don't know. I never asked.
you should talk to the man who pulled the trigger.
but you better hurry. His days are numbered.
what happened?
I don't know. - It's all gone.
burglary in a police station? - And you?
I was ambushed. Woke up in Epping Forest.
you're lucky to be alive.
that's where Ronnie and Reggie disposed of bodies.
anyone sent a message last night?
Yeah. They threatened my family.
are they OK?
Yeah. I sent them away last night. Judy's in bits.
I had a gun pointed at me.
well, I didn't get threatened.
I did get a bunch of flowers.
a lucky horseshoe. - That was a wreath.
you were looking at it upsidedown.
how about you? - No. Nothing.
clean slate. Fresh start.
great! Where DO we start?
with this.
I've got to go and change my clothes first.
lord Hessel. Sorry to turn up unannounced.
I'm DI Chandler. This is DS Miles.
you'd better have a damn good reason for this or I'll have you back in uniform patrolling estates in a week.
actually, I have half a dozen excellent reasons.
well, you can't prove that's me.
Oh, hell's bells!
do you know how many laws you are breaking in that picture?
look, the thing is,
I didn't know they were gangsters to begin with.
blackmail?
my own mistake. Obviously.
an indiscretion which placed me in their power.
and I am not alone.
they are on all sides of the house.
I need your testimony.
enough to arrest, charge and bring this to an end.
I can guarantee your anonymity. Even your wife won't know.
do you really think my word is going to be enough to stop them?
you're a peer of the realm. A good place to start.
I know it's irregular for the Crown Prosecution Service to do this, but if Jimmy and Johnny Kray find out people are talking, they'll have them killed.
we want to guarantee our witnesses' anonymity and keep their statements sealed and confidential until the trial.
many witnesses will be criminals so we require discretion to overlook minor crimes.
didn't the police make the same arrangement in 1967?
nipper Read did. It was the only way he could bring the case to trial.
funny how history repeats itself.
I'm sure we can draw up an agreement.
thanks for coming.
all you need is a witness to get the ball rolling.
we have one. - Really?
must be a brave man or someone desperate for revenge.
he's being blackmailed.
the quality of a witness really matters in court.
I hope for your sake your man is of good standing.
he's a peer. - Excellent.
that'll play well with the jury.
this calls for a small celebration.
are you buying? I'll get dolled up.
di Chandler? - That's me. Can I help you?
Yes. I'm from the CPS. We have a meeting.
well, an hour ago. - I'm sorry. My tyres were slashed.
and then someone stole my mobile. I had to bus it from Acton.
we just had a CPS lawyer here called Wayland.
no, you couldn't have. I'm Wayland.
then who the hell were we just talking to?
Hey! YOU!
stop! - They never stop! Get your car!
my car. Where's my car?
well, I ain't chasing him on that.
so it's true? You shot Freddie Miles?
none of us ever refused Ron anything.
but Freddie did.
he... He had to.
and he paid the price for it.
but he didn't deserve to die. - No.
you can take it to the grave or you can make it right.
make your peace.
I did what I was told.
it didn't matter if I agreed with it or not.
but...
I can't carry it any more.
bless you.
Er...57
lord Hessel has had a change of heart.
he won't talk. - I know.
are you OK?
I know how this looks.
I just get a bit OCD sometimes.
it's just something I do when I'm under stress.
I'm not crazy.
there's nothing wrong with me. I can do the job.
if tidying eases your stress, come round to my house.
I think there might be a reason for our bad luck.
last night, when everyone was intimidated and this place ransacked,
Kent was working here on his own...
and nothing happened to him.
I asked him to look into who hired the builder and he found nothing.
I asked him to contact the Congo about what Jimmy and Johnny Kray got up to out there.
and he found nothing.
hello.
tell me I'm wrong.
he's just a kid.
and they hurt him badly.
I almost can't blame him.
you want me to tell him? - No.
no, he should hear it from me.
put the phone down.
I've got a lead on the Congo. - Put the phone down and pack your things.
sir?
you're suspended pending an investigation. Go home.
you think I'm a mole.
out of everyone, I really wish it hadn't been you.
may I...er...? - I'd rather you didn't.
Oh. Well, I have some results to show you.
I saw young Kent in tears.
Yes. I know. - Crying.
next to a donkey. - I know.
didn't see your car anywhere.
I'm totally aware of my current situation.
it's like we're cursed.
I can't trust anybody around me and the only person helping me is a villain.
who's the villain? - He's part of Jimmy and Johnny's firm.
he's also a double agent working for me.
I'd be wary of accepting help.
back in the '60s, there was a man called Alan Cooper who worked for the Krays as an armourer.
he provided them with bombs and guns. What they didn't realise is that he was working for the head of the murder squad, John Du Rose.
I am being wary. If it wasn't for his leads, this investigation would have stalled.
alan Cooper also worked for the US State Department.
he was a man of shadows.
you need to find out who else your man is working for...
perhaps he could be from the dark side too.
if I don't use him, I've got nothing except the past.
I've been over every detail like you said.
I still don't see how you can use history to catch the Krays.
OK.
we must free our minds and rely on instincts and intuitions.
anything is possible.
let us detect.
please. We can hardly pluck the answer from thin air.
Ronnie and Reggie Kray were tried together.
in my opinion, this would never happen again.
Ronnie was insane and not fit to stand trial and Reggie should have argued he was coerced into murder by Ronnie.
Yes, but they refused to betray one another. - Exactly.
they remained inside until they died.
but no-one would want to repeat that bit of history.
that's it.
divide and conquer.
I want you to set up a meeting between me and Johnny Kray.
just Johnny.
what makes you think Johnny wants to betray Jimmy?
he doesn't want to spend 30 years in prison.
they're twins.
but they're not alike any more, are they?
just talk to Johnny.
Johnny'll be in touch. He'll send someone to contact one of us.
driving a wedge between the twins is a good idea.
bold. - Buchan's.
Oh, Jesus! I'll keep my fingers crossed then.
you're the messenger? - Yeah.
well, they don't give you a choice.
miles? - Carpenter's Arms.
do you know it? - I'll find it.
where is he, then? - He's on his way.
Yeah, well...
Johnny won't give him a second chance. - He'll be here.
come on!
Cheers.
he's bottled it. - Any second now.
so this is your revenge, is it?
swapping sides?
putting me back in uniform meant I lost a lot of pay.
I had to make up the mortgage somehow.
an open bar and you choose that?
I couldn't see any tea making facilities.
do you want ice?
someone's looking after you, then.
someone in high places.
that's all I know.
Where's Fitz?
I can't hear a heartbeat.
wait a minute. He's wearing...
he's wearing body armour!
you bastard!
come on. Wake up!
you knew this was an ambush!
you KNEW we could have got killed!
what do you want me to do, eh?
die with you?!
I got family. - Yeah. So have I!
you are under arrest.
you are the only person in the world who is trying to stop them.
the only one who doesn't get it.
so go on. Arrest me.
come on!
you're on borrowed time.
di Chandler.
you're a dead man.
as of now, consider the Krays allies rather than targets.
what they got on you? Money? Sex? What is it?
you've been drinking. You're not fit to lead any enquiry.
see anything you like?
magnificent, aren't they?
God's tears.
Yeah.
it's beautiful.
so are the others. I, uh...
I guess I just... have to make the right decision.
in the end, it's not your eye that must decide.
Yeah.
did Rebecca call?
Yeah. She'll be at the restaurant in an hour to take you to the airport.
I put your tickets, passport, and your new cell phone in your briefcase and Hong will be there in ten minutes.
Thanks. See you in four days.
the second you land, those guys are gonna start poking and prodding to see what you're made of.
are you sure I'm the right guy for this, Walter?
I'm no good at this corporate stuff, I hate flying.
and isn't this Bob's thing, anyway?
Bob? Come on, you're gonna be fine.
just don't eat anything that wears a collar, and if you need me, I'll be on the beach in Cozumel screening my calls.
Look...this is a big break for you.
but I'm giving you this account because I think you're the right man for the job.
besides, you're gonna be a member of the family soon, right?
going down, please.
Oh. Matthew, keep away from the bang-bang girls or Rebecca will kick my ass, all right?
Matty.
Matty! - Luke! Hey, man.
how are you, man? - I'm good. How are you?
really good. Really good. Good to see you. You look great.
Thanks, man. I mean, I do.
you still doing that whole advertising thing in New York?
I moved back.
when did you get back? - Two months ago.
two months? What are you doing?
you don't call your friend? You could've called me.
I know. I just - I moved back with a girl that I met in New York and I'm working for her brother, and it's...
that sounds serious.
maybe. I don't know. We'll see.
you look very serious. Look at you.
I know, man.
hold on!
listen, man.
Yeah, I need to probably move my car, too.
and then I'm going to China tonight.
china? That's weird. - Yeah, I know.
let me give you a call when I get back. Monday?
Yeah, sounds good - shut up!
all right, look, here's my card. Don't wait two years - call me!
the old shop.
all right? - I will, man.
you look good. That's a nice tie.
good to see you.
are you done? Come on!
he's very impressed with what you've done, and he assures you that when you get to China, you'll be met with much enthusiasm and support.
thank you very much.
some champagne, please. Excuse me.
excuse you.

Yeah.

I don't ever want to see you again, Daniel.

Lisa!
whoa. Hey, come on.

I pissed her off.

Oh! This stupid...

Oh, my God.

Lisa?

Hello?
Lisa?

that line - what it does to your calf - that is what we call sexy.
wanna try pink? Hmm?
okay. - Okay. Have a seat.
Hey. There you are. Where you been?
you look like shit. I hope she was worth it.
Hey, do we have a size ten in pink?
Yeah, in the back.
Hey, Ellie. - Hey.
I gotta talk to you. - Lady Dragon Shoes.
Ow. So, who is she?
you wouldn't believe me.
betcha I do. I probably even know her. What's her name?
that's the thing.
you don't know her name? Oh, man.
I know that she's a dancer.
you mean, like a stripper?
no, shithead.
Oh, God.
but her face is like...
her eyes...
...and her...skin is just...
she just makes me all...
what is "wha" and "duh"? She just makes you more inarticulate than usual.
you are obsessed.
I mean, I don't know how...
I mean, my customer over there - she's got great legs. Ellie.
all right? There is something hot about Ellie.
the blonde at the window.
I mean, come on.
what are you doing?
Matty, are you all right?
lady Dragon Shoes. Can I help you?
the blonde?
what are you doing?
give me some shoes.
shoes? - Yeah.
got lots of shoes.
I'm sorry I took so long. Pink. It's my last pair.
could I help you with anything?
Yes.
those shoes in the window.
the black ones with the red sole.
I'd like to try them on, please.
the blacks and reds. Okay.
I'll just go in the back and get them for you.
that's where we keep them - in the back - so...
I'll be right back.
uh, Matty?
maybe you'd like to ask the lady what size shoe she wears.
right. - 8 1/2.
right.
I mean his movie, not his shoe size.
shit.
what was that?
Fellini! What the hell was I thinking?
I have no idea.
but you were right about one thing. God, she's beautiful.
and you, my man, are an idiot.
all right, look. Here's the thing, all right?
you've obviously blown it, she obviously hates you, so you stay right here and let the man take a shot.
shut up. Give me the shoes. - All right. Go.
just remember - you're not funny.
here we go. Black and red.
what do you think?
they're too big.
too big? Really?
Luke, these are 9 1/2s.
I'm sorry. That's the smallest size we have.
Oh, well. Too bad.
not - you know... not necessarily.
we can order these for you.
special order. And, uh - I can, uh, if you leave your number,
I can give you a call personally when they come in.
do you normally spy on people?
what?
are you really gonna tell me that you're a huge fan of modern dance?
look, I've never done.
honestly - could you let me take you out for a cup of coffee and explain?
I don't think so.
I'll stay on my side of the table. I promise.
just call me when the shoes come in, okay?
listen, I'm not...
shit.
tomorrow night. 6: 00. Cafe Tangiers on Kinzie.
now you won't have to follow me.
well, my parents eventually split up, and my mom moved back to Prague.
but my dad's still here. He lives in California.
I wish I was in California right now.
so, why did you want to become a photographer?
fish.
fish.
tropical fish, actually.
when I was a kid, I used to go to the library and pick out all the books...
...with tropical fish, you know.
beautiful colors and shapes.
when I was eight years old, I realized someone had to take pictures of the fish.
and I wanted that to be me.
but I grew up and I realized that...
things don't have to be extraordinary to be beautiful.
the ordinary could be just as beautiful.
like what?
well...
like - you see the couple there?
look at the way the girl is holding on to him so tight.
but he can still drink his coffee.
it looks like she feels safe wrapped around him.
and if you believe that, I'll tell you another one.
take my picture.
I feel beautiful tonight.
Bye.
Bye.
okay.
Hi. - Hi.
ma'am?
I have your dry cleaning.
shit.
Hey, you're not in China.
I didn't make it past O'Hare.
what happened? - I found Lisa.
whoa.
here it is.
this is the article she left behind.
the funeral's today.
I can't believe you're blowing off Shanghai for this.
this isn't actually Lisa. This is a compact.
what about your woman? What's her name, anyway?
Rebecca.
Yeah, I mean...
shit.
is it broke?
you superstitious?
God, I am so stupid. Here, give it to me.
no, no. It's okay. - I'm sorry.
you're right. This doesn't make any sense.
one minute I'm looking at rings, and the next I'm here, doing this.
whoa. Whoa, looking at rings?
I didn't realize you were that serious.
apparently, I'm not.
see, that's how the universe works.
the minute you make a decision - you decide on anything
along comes temptation.
what would you do?
keep them both and hope they didn't find out about each other is what I would do.
that's perfect. Asshole.
I have to find out why she left.
she got scared. Everyone gets scared.
no, not Lisa. She wouldn't have left
without some sort of letter or a call or something.
she's not like that.
something must've happened, and whatever it was
screwed you up big time.
I know she loved me.
so let me borrow your keys, okay?
Why?
the funeral's today. It's the only lead I've got.
Oh...my car.
come on. - Okay. I know. I'm sorry.
you just have to be back by 7: 00.
I will. Thank you.
I've got a date.
you got a date?
Yeah, I got a date.
with who?
this actress that came into my shop a couple weeks ago, and, uh...
God, I like her a lot.
I won't be. 6: 00. I'll be back by 6: 00, okay?
Lisa. I've been trying to find you.
I have your powder case. Call me.
excuse me?
what can I do for you?
I found a hotel key in the back yesterday.
a woman left it. I don't know if you saw her.
she fell right over there. Broke her heel.
yesterday? Yeah, that's right. I remember.
you wanted to leave the keys with me?
no. Actually, l, uh...
could you give her this note if she comes back in here?
no problem. - Thanks a lot.
sure.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa. I returned your key as you asked.
you must let me see you if only for one last time.
call me. My heart can't stand it.
all my love. Daniel.
shit.
ass. - I'm so sorry.
Hey, I could explain. - You are an asshole.
do me a favor - don't ask me for any more favors.
come on. Luke...
I found her. I think I found her. I found her apartment, anyway.
I'm really happy for you, Matty.
I left a note under her door to meet me at the park tomorrow.
guess you guys should have a picnic.
Jesus, man.
my entire evening is screwed.
look, I'm not really that late, brother.
Alex doesn't wait for anyone. Trust me. I've already left three messages.
well, why didn't you take a cab?
cause I was waiting for you. I was waiting for my car.
Luke, it's not that late.
go over there? And do what? Throw little pebbles up at her window?
she's gone. It's over. Just forget it.
maybe not.
I hope, for our friendship, this is who I want it to be.
want to see how cool I am? Three rings.
Hello?
Hey, how's it goin'?
Oh, I'm so sorry. Did you get my messages?
no, I lent my car to my buddy Matt, and he was a little late coming home.
no, sure. He's right here. Hold on a sec.
she wants to talk to you.
fix it. You have to fix it.
Hello?
he's full of shit. isn't he?
Yeah, he's full of shit, all right.
Yeah. I knew it.
he didn't lend me his car. I took it.
I stole his keys.
that's good.
why would you do that?
because I'm a selfish idiot.
and I had this whole thing going on that...
I don't wanna bore you with it.
please. I insist.
okay.
well, um...
I was looking for somebody. A woman.
I wasn't thinking.
got a little desperate.
Oh. I'm sorry.
no.
I should be apologizing to you.
and I am apologizing to you. I'm very sorry that I ruined your evening.
did you find her?
I think so. Yeah. I found where she lives.
well. you should go back. and you should look for her.
I think I will. Thanks.
you're boring now. Give me the phone.
okay, Alex. I gotta go. - Nice to talk to you.
nice to talk to you, too. Bye-bye.
she's nice, man.
Thanks.
Hello?
okay. Why don't I just-- I'll pick you up at the theater.
I think not so, my lord.
dear lad, believe it, for they shall yet belie thy happy years to say thou art a man.
prosper well in this, and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord to call his fortunes thine.
I'll do my best to woo your lady...
...and yet a barful strife.
Whoe'er I woo,
Alex, what's going on?
what do you mean?
well, I'm sitting in the audience and I'm getting nothing.
I figured maybe I'm missing something, so I come, I take a closer look.
but you know what? I'm still not buying it.
what the hell's the matter with you today?
look, the line, "Whoe'er I woo," defines your character.
you're in love with this guy, and he is asking you to help him get another woman!
you're upset, you're confused, it's tearing you up inside!
we've gotta see the love, but we've also gotta see the agony.
you have been in love before.
Yes. Sure.
Oh, good. Well, please, share a little something with us, huh?
God. you sound so close. Can't believe you're 7. 000 miles away.
I know. It's crazy, isn't it?
how's the weather?
I don't know. It's still dark out.
isn't it Iike 10: 00 in the morning there?
I - you know what?
I'm so zonked, I didn't you know what - it's actually a really nice day out, now that I see it.
are you sure nothing's wrong?
no. I'm just a little out of it, that's all.
well. you better get in it. because today's meeting is very important.
you'll be fine. honey. I'll speak to you later, okay?
I miss you. Bye.
Bye.
Lisa. I found your powder case.
I have to see you.
meet me tomorrow at 3: 00. our usual spot.
Hello?
Lisa?
fuck.
Lisa?
Jesus Christ! I'm sorry. It's okay.
I'm calling the police! Where's the phone?
No! Don't call the police! I'm not gonna hurt you.
get away from me! - Okay! Okay! Calm down!
calm down. It's okay.
I'm a friend of Lisa's.
a friend of Lisa's?
Yeah.
is that supposed to be funny?
no. You can ask her when she comes, okay?
I'm Lisa. I live here.
your name's Lisa?
Yeah.
and you live here?
Yeah.
no...
I'm calling the cops. - No, wait. Don't.
Hey, you see that letter there?
you wrote that? - Yeah.
you were at Bellucci's on Monday.
yeah...I was.
and you had a room at The Drake, room 679?
Yeah.
how'd you know that?
I can't believe I did this.
I'm going crazy. Here.
that's yours.
it's broken.
I'd be happy to pay for it. You know, my bad luck.
wait.
your hand.
it's bleeding.
it's all right.
I got this.
no, l...
okay.
thank you.
you know, at the restaurant.
I would've bet anything you were this girl I used to know.
but now seeing you here, you don't really look that much like her at all.
must be hallucinating.
I was crazy about her.
so, what about the, uh...
Daniel. - Yeah. What's his story?
he's been stalking me.
he scares the hell out of me.
that's why I was staying in the hotel - because I didn't want him to find me.
I hope he didn't follow you here.
I don't think so. No.
how's your hand?
it's okay.
I wasn't even hungry or anything.
actually, you know what?
thank you for everything.
for the bandage...
...not calling the cops...
...not beating me to death with the little bronze ballerina, or...
you're leaving?
Yeah.
I'm late, you know.
very late, actually, for China, so...
china. That's funny.
that's what my friend said, too.
well, maybe you should wait.
I can't. I mean... I gotta go.
do you really think planes are still taking off this late?
what are you doing?
I'm scared.
of him.
I haven't stayed alone here since his wife died, and...
would you mind if you stayed?
Lisa, you don't even know me. I broke into your apartment.
I know. I know. I know.
but - don't take this the wrong way, but I just think you're a nice guy.
that's all.
okay.
good.
where does a nice guy sleep?
a nice guy sleeps on the couch.
what are you doing?
I'm watching you sleep.
Lisa!
Hey, how are you?
what are you doing here?
I gotta talk to you.
now?
Yeah, it's kind of important.
wanna go get a drink or something? It's freezing out here.
okay. - Okay? Come on.
my friend gave my stuff to this head of the agency, and...he liked it.
So...he offered me a job in New York.
that's great.
it'll help me pay my rent, but...
but what? Why not?
move in with me.
I - I know it's only been a couple of months, but I just, um...
you're the reason I don't wanna move to New York.
I wanna make my life here with you.
look, I'm really late for rehearsal. Can we talk about this tomorrow?
sure.
Matthew, trust me, okay?
just meet me tomorrow in the park. Same time.
Bye.
have you seen Lisa?
Lisa?
she's gone on a European tour of Cabaret.
it all happened real fast.
they came to our rehearsal and just picked her out, and she was gone.
Like...did she say anything before she left?
like what?
like, uh...
cool. Thanks.
okay.
Hi. - Hi.
you want a cup of coffee?
Yeah, sure. Thanks.
no.
no.
no.
Yeah.
he broke all my cups.
that's original.
sugar?
Thanks. Yeah.
thank you.
to us.
leaving?
Yeah. I have to go to work.
I'm due at the hospital.
that's right. You're a nurse.
I got a double shift.
you should stay.
you have a key?
Yeah.
well, I should be back by 10: 00.
will I see you later?
maybe.
Yeah.
Bye. - Bye.
you were at Bellucci's on Monday.
Yeah. I was.
Hello?
what happened to you?
hang on. Just a minute!
look, could I stay at your place for a couple of days?
Yeah. of course. - Great.
well, I've gotta call Daniel first, then I'll be right over.
okay. - Bye.
magnificent, aren't they?
God's tears.
Yeah.
it's beautiful.
so are the others. I, uh...
I guess I just... have to make the right decision.
in the end, it's not your eye that must decide.
Yeah.
did Rebecca call?
Yeah. She'll be at the restaurant in an hour to take you to the airport.
I put your tickets, passport, and your new cell phone in your briefcase and Hong will be there in ten minutes.
Thanks. See you in four days.
the second you land, those guys are gonna start poking and prodding to see what you're made of.
are you sure I'm the right guy for this, Walter?
I'm no good at this corporate stuff, I hate flying.
and isn't this Bob's thing, anyway?
Bob? Come on, you're gonna be fine.
just don't eat anything that wears a collar, and if you need me, I'll be on the beach in Cozumel screening my calls.
Look...this is a big break for you.
but I'm giving you this account because I think you're the right man for the job.
besides, you're gonna be a member of the family soon, right?
going down, please.
Oh. Matthew, keep away from the bang-bang girls or Rebecca will kick my ass, all right?
Matty.
Matty! - Luke! Hey, man.
how are you, man? - I'm good. How are you?
really good. Really good. Good to see you. You look great.
Thanks, man. I mean, I do.
you still doing that whole advertising thing in New York?
I moved back.

two months? What are you doing?

I know. I just--I moved back with a girl that I met in New York and I'm working for her brother, and it's...
that sounds serious.

you look very serious. Look at you.
I know, man.
hold on!
listen, man,
Yeah, I need to probably move my car, too.
and then I'm going to China tonight.

to a long and prosperous marriage of our two companies.
are you okay?
Yeah.
um, excuse me.
I'll be right back.
excuse me,
just a minute!
sorry.
no, you listen! And I don't feel like calming down.
it's over, okay? That's why I wanted to meet.
no, actually I don't think it was an accident.
it's in the paper!
I don't ever want to see you again, Daniel.
stop following me, or I'll call the police!
Lisa.
Lisa!
whoa. Hey, come on.
are you all right?
I pissed her off.
you wanna put that on this card, please?
Oh! This stupid...
need some help there, Mare?
what's up? - It's so frustrating.
I just can't work out why there's no sound.
I just...
Matthew? Hello?
anybody home?
I'll take this one, if you want.
knock yourself out, kid.
Oh, my God.
shit.
they wanna know how long--hey! - Mary, I'll be right back.
sorry. - Where are you going?!
Oh, sorry!
Hey, guys. - Hey, Lisa.
see you inside.
Hey.
Hey.
probably time to go, right? - Yes.
okay.
pre-boarding call for flight 752 to Munich.
all passengers should board at this time at gate 5-A.
I guess, uh, this is it.
are you sure nothing's wrong?
no. No, I'm fine.
okay. Well, call me when you get there.
okay. I will.
I love you.
me, too.
Bye.
Bye.
your attention. please.
this is the final boarding call for American Airlines flight 153
service to Shanghai.
all passengers should now be boarding at gate 1 0-b.
Matthew Simon. S-l-M-O-N.
shit.
Yeah.
Yeah. No, he's not on the plane.
he's...
he's sick.
no, he's very sick. He has food poisoning.
no, he'll be there.
Lisa?
all right.
Hello?
Lisa?
here. Sweetie. Just take one of these to help you sleep on the plane.
that line--what it does to your calf-- that is what we call sexy.
wanna try pink? Hmm?
okay. - Okay. Have a seat.
Hey. There you are. Where you been?
you look like shit. I hope she was worth it.
Hey, do we have a size ten in pink?
Yeah, in the back.
Hey, Ellie. - Hey.
I gotta talk to you. - Lady Dragon Shoes.
Ow. So, who is she?
you wouldn't believe me.
betcha I do. I probably even know her. What's her name?
that's the thing.
you don't know her name? Oh, man.
I know that she's a dancer.
you mean, like a stripper?
no, shithead.
Oh, God.
but her face is like...
her eyes...
...and her...skin is just...
she just makes me all...
what is "wha" and "duh"? She just makes you more inarticulate than usual.
you are obsessed,
I mean, I don't know how.
I mean, my customer over there-- she's got great legs. Ellie.
all right? There is something hot about Ellie.
the blonde at the window.
I mean, come on.
what are you doing?
Matty, are you all right?
lady Dragon Shoes. Can I help you?
the blonde?
what are you doing?
give me some shoes.
shoes? - Yeah.
got lots of shoes.
I'm sorry I took so long. Pink. It's my last pair.
could I help you with anything?
Yes.
those shoes in the window.
the black ones with the red sole.
I'd like to try them on, please.
the blacks and reds. Okay.
I'll just go in the back and get them for you.
that's where we keep them-- in the back--so...
I'll be right back.
uh, Matty?
maybe you'd like to ask the lady what size shoe she wears.
right. - 8 12.
like Fellini.
right.
I mean his movie, not his shoe size.
8 12.
shit.
what was that?
Fellini! What the hell was I thinking?
I have no idea.
but you were right about one thing. God, she's beautiful.
and you, my man, are an idiot.
all right, look. Here's the thing, all right?
you've obviously blown it, she obviously hates you, so you stay right here and let the man take a shot.
shut up. Give me the shoes. - All right. Go.
just remember-- you're not funny.
here we go. Black and red.
what do you think?
they're too big.
too big? Really?
Luke, these are 9 12s.
I'm sorry. That's the smallest size we have.
Oh, well. Too bad.
Not--you know... not necessarily.
we can order these for you.
special order. And, uh-- I can, uh, if you leave your number,
I can give you a call personally when they come in.
do you normally spy on people?
what?
are you really gonna tell me that you're a huge fan of modern dance?
look, I've never done.
Honestly--could you let me take you out for a cup of coffee and explain?
I don't think so.
I'll stay on my side of the table. I promise.
just call me when the shoes come in, okay?
listen, I'm not.
shit.
tomorrow night. 6: 00. Cafe Tangiers on Kinzie.
now you wont have to follow me.
well, my parents eventually split up, and my mom moved back to Prague.
but my dad's still here. He lives in California.
I wish I was in California right now.
so, why did you want to become a photographer?
fish.
fish.
tropical fish, actually.
when I was a kid, I used to go to the library and pick out all the books...
...with tropical fish, you know.
beautiful colors and shapes.
when I was eight years old, I realized someone had to take pictures of the fish.
and I wanted that to be me.
but I grew up and I realized that...
things don't have to be extraordinary to be beautiful.
the ordinary could be just as beautiful.
like what?
well...
like--You see the couple there?
look at the way the girl is holding on to him so tight.
but he can still drink his coffee.
it looks like she feels safe wrapped around him.
and if you believe that, I'll tell you another one.
take my picture.
I feel beautiful tonight.
Bye.
Bye.
okay.
Hi. - Hi.
ma'am?
I have your dry cleaning.
shit.
Hey, you're not in China.
I didn't make it past O'Hare.
what happened? - I found Lisa.
whoa.
here it is.
this is the article she left behind.
the funeral's today.
I can't believe you're blowing off Shanghai for this.
this isn't actually Lisa. This is a compact.
what about your woman? What's her name, anyway?
Rebecca.
Yeah, I mean, isn't.
shit.
is it broke?
you superstitious?
God, I am so stupid. Here, give it to me.
no, no. It's okay. - I'm sorry.
you're right. This doesn't make any sense.
one minute I'm looking at rings, and the next I'm here, doing this.
whoa. Whoa, looking at rings?
I didn't realize you were that serious.
apparently, I'm not.
see, that's how the universe works.
the minute you make a decision-- you decide on anything.
along comes temptation.
what would you do?
keep them both and hope they didn't find out about each other is what I would do.
that's perfect. Asshole.
I have to find out why she left.
she got scared. Everyone gets scared.
no, not Lisa. She wouldn't have left.
without some sort of letter or a call or something.
she's not like that.
something must've happened, and whatever it was.
screwed you up big time.
I know she loved me.
so let me borrow your keys, okay?
Why?
the funeral's today. It's the only lead I've got.
Oh...my car.
come on. - Okay. I know. I'm sorry.
you just have to be back by 7: 00.
I will. Thank you.
I've got a date.
you got a date?
Yeah, I got a date.
with who?
this actress that came into my shop a couple weeks ago, and, uh...
God, I like her a lot,
I won't be. 6: 00. I'll be back by 6: 00, okay?
Lisa. I've been trying to find you.
I have your powder case. Call me at.
excuse me?
what can I do for you?
I found a hotel key in the back yesterday.
a woman left it. I don't know if you saw her.
she fell right over there. Broke her heel.
yesterday? Yeah, that's right. I remember.
you wanted to leave the keys with me?
no. Actually, l, uh...
could you give her this note if she comes back in here?
no problem. - Thanks a lot.
sure.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa. I returned your key as you asked.
you must let me see you if only for one last time.
call me. My heart can't stand it.
all my love. Daniel.
shit.
ass. - I'm so sorry.
Hey, I could explain. - You are an asshole.
do me a favor-- don't ask me for any more favors.
come on. Luke...
I found her. I think I found her. I found her apartment, anyway.
I'm really happy for you, Matty.
I left a note under her door to meet me at the park tomorrow.
guess you guys should have a picnic.
Jesus, man.
my entire evening is screwed.
look, I'm not really that late, brother.
Alex doesn't wait for anyone. Trust me. I've already left three messages.
well, why didn't you take a cab?
cause I was waiting for you. I was waiting for my car.
Luke, it's not that late.
go over there? And do what? Throw little pebbles up at her window?
she's gone. It's over. Just forget it.
maybe not.
I hope, for our friendship, this is who I want it to be.
want to see how cool I am? Three rings.
Hello?
Hey, how's it goin'?
Oh, I'm so sorry. Did you get my messages?
no, I lent my car to my buddy Matt, and he was a little late coming home.
no, sure. He's right here. Hold on a sec.
she wants to talk to you.
fix it. You have to fix it.
Hello?
he's full of shit. isn't he?
Yeah, he's full of shit, all right.
Yeah. I knew it.
he didn't lend me his car. I took it.
I stole his keys.
that's good.
why Would you do that?
because I'm a selfish idiot.
and I had this whole thing going on that...
I don't wanna bore you with it.
please. I insist.
okay.
well, um...
I was looking for somebody. A woman.
I wasn't thinking.
got a little desperate.
Oh. I'm sorry.
no.
I should be apologizing to you.
and I am apologizing to you. I'm very sorry that I ruined your evening.
did you find her?
I think so. Yeah. I found where she lives.
well. You should go back. And you should look for her.
I think I will. Thanks.
you're boring now. Give me the phone.
okay, Alex. I gotta go. - Nice to talk to you.
nice to talk to you, too. Bye-bye.
she's nice, man.
Thanks.
Hello?
okay. Why don't I just-- I'll pick you up at the theater.
I think not so, my lord.
dear lad, believe it, for they shall yet belie thy happy years to say thou art a man.
prosper well in this, and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord to call his fortunes thine.
I'll do my best to woo your lady...
...and yet a barful strife.
Whoe'er I woo,
Alex, what's going on?
what do you mean?
well, I'm sitting in the audience and I'm getting nothing.
I figured maybe I'm missing something, so I come, I take a closer look.
but you know what? I'm still not buying it.
what the hell's the matter with you today?
look, the line, "Whoe'er I woo," defines your character.
you're in love with this guy, and he is asking you to help him get another woman!
you're upset, you're confused, it's tearing you up inside!
we've gotta see the love, but we've also gotta see the agony.
you have been in love before,
Yes. Sure.
Oh, good. Well, please, share a little something with us, huh?
God. you sound so close. Can't believe you're 7. 000 miles away.
I know. It's crazy, isn't it?
how's the weather?
I don't know. It's still dark out.
isn't it. Like. 10: 00 in the morning there?
I--you know what?
I'm so zonked, I didn't you know what--it's actually a really nice day out, now that I see it.
are you sure nothing's wrong?
no. I'm just a little out of it, that's all.
well. you better get in it. because today's meeting is very important.
you'll be fine. Honey. I'll speak to you later. Okay?
I miss you. bye.
Bye.
Lisa. I found your powder case.
I have to see you.
meet me tomorrow at 3: 00. Our usual spot.
Matt.
Hello?
Lisa?
fuck.
Lisa?
Jesus Christ! I'm sorry. It's okay.
I'm calling the police! Where's the phone?
No! Don't call the police! I'm not gonna hurt you.
get away from me! - Okay! Okay! Calm down!
calm down. It's okay.
I'm a friend of Lisa's.
a friend of Lisa's?
Yeah.
is that supposed to be funny?
no. You can ask her when she comes, okay?
I'm Lisa. I live here.
your name's Lisa?
Yeah.
and you live here?
Yeah.
no...
I'm calling the cops. - No, wait. Don't.
Hey, you see that letter there?
you wrote that? - Yeah.
you were at Bellucci's on Monday.
yeah...I was.
and you had a room at The Drake, room 679?
Yeah.
how'd you know that?
I can't believe I did this.
I'm going crazy. Here.
that's yours.
it's broken.
I'd be happy to pay for it. You know, my bad luck.
wait.
your hand.
it's bleeding.
it's all right.
I got this.
no, l...
okay.
thank you.
you know, at the restaurant,
I would've bet anything you were this girl I used to know.
but now seeing you here, you don't really look that much like her at all.
must be hallucinating.
I was crazy about her.
so, what about the, uh...
Daniel. - Yeah. What's his story?
he's been stalking me.
he scares the hell out of me.
that's why I was staying in the hotel-- because I didn't want him to find me.
I hope he didn't follow you here.
I don't think so. No.
how's your hand?
it's okay.
I wasn't even hungry or anything.
actually, you know what?
thank you for everything.
for the bandage...
...not calling the cops...
...not beating me to death with the little bronze ballerina, or...
you're leaving?
Yeah.
I'm late, you know.
very late, actually, for China, so...
china. That's funny.
that's what my friend said, too.
well, maybe you should wait.
I can't. I mean... I gotta go.
do you really think planes are still taking off this late?
what are you doing?
I'm scared.
of him.
I haven't stayed alone here since his wife died, and...
would you mind if you stayed?
Lisa, you don't even know me. I broke into your apartment.
I know. I know. I know.
But--don't take this the wrong way, but I just think you're a nice guy.
that's all.
okay.
good.
where does a nice guy sleep?
a nice guy sleeps on the couch.
what are you doing?
I'm watching you sleep.
Lisa!
Hey, how are you?
what are you doing here?
I gotta talk to you.
now?
Yeah, it's kind of important.
wanna go get a drink or something? It's freezing out here.
okay. - Okay? Come on.
my friend gave my stuff to this head of the agency, and...
he liked it.
so...
he offered me a job in New York.
that's great.
it'll help me pay my rent, but...
but what? Why not?
move in with me.
I--I know it's only been a couple of months, but I just, um...
you're the reason I don't wanna move to New York.
I wanna make my life here with you.
look, I'm really late for rehearsal. Can we talk about this tomorrow?
sure.
Matthew, trust me, okay?
just meet me tomorrow in the park. Same time.
Bye.
have you seen Lisa?
Lisa?
she's gone on a European tour of Cabaret.
it all happened real fast.
they came to our rehearsal and just picked her out, and she was gone.
Like...did she say anything before she left?
like what?
like, uh...
cool. Thanks.
her feet weren't ordinary.
because of them, she went where ordinary feet would never have taken her.
unable to buy shoes just anywhere, from just anyone, she had to go to a shoemaker in Paris, located...
I forget the name now.
it's on a street near some pillars.
the incident occurred as she left the shop.
what incident?
nothing significant, nothing important.
a perfectly mundane incident, something commonplace.
but the commonplace and mundane can lead to...
to what? That's what we'll see.
it was a beautiful day. The sky was blue.
a winter sun.
and she was in Paris to buy shoes.
she hoped to see the girl she liked, whose touch gave her a vague feeling of pleasure.
choosing, trying... That took time.
a matter of color, model, size that never match.
if you want all those things to match up, you have to accept, however reluctantly, to renounce, yield and compromise.
in the end, she chose a pair close to what she wanted, of a similar color, and which, above all, fit like a glove.
goodbye.
she nearly cried out.
how about that!
what did she nearly cry?
stop thief! Stop him!
she thought of it, you know. One does in such cases.
if you drown, you cry out, "Help! I'm drowning! Save me!
it's ridiculous, but do we have much choice?
we don't even have time to find words of love ridiculous.
we cry out, "Help! Help me! I'm being murdered! Murder!
in fact, the words get stuck. We don't dare to.
we die too scared to call out. True terror is silent, mouth agape.
in short, she didn't dare.
she needed money, but she had none left.
she had her shoes and decided to return them.
she went back to the shop.
she explained what had occurred. They understood. It happens.
she asked for a refund.
she also said she'd come back for the shoes.
then she thanked them, said goodbye, returned home, and ran herself an ice-cold bath.
it was too cold.
she added hot water, thinking, telling herself...
the police station can wait.
there are hundreds of thefts every day.
besides, did I really need shoes?
no, not really.
well, yes, I did.
no, I didn't need shoes.
it's my fault, it was just a whim, like that.
a treat, the way people buy CD's, just to...
come on, calm down.
you must declare the theft of your papers, your checkbook, your credit cards...
I have to call the bank.
I'll do all that tomorrow.
it's bound to stop in the end, it's worn out.
just like me.
why don't we stop?
I need a new battery.
certainly.
I'm used to it. Let me.
thank you.
she'll mess up the date indicator.
what do I owe you? - 15 euros.
that's how it began.
it might not have begun.
he first picked up the wallet.
name, Muir.
first name, Marguerite. Distinguishing features, none.
address, 8, rue des Ecoles, Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine.
a serious-looking face, a little despondent, sad, even.
you could say sad, a hint of sadness.
but it was only a photo...
so, sad at that moment.
pilot's LICENSE - PRIVATE PLANE
so different!
it can't be the same woman.
it is, though. It's the same name.
the same address.
in this photo, she's smiling.
a headband...
goggles on her forehead, as a joke, no doubt.
so she likes to joke.
all right. She's a woman, sad more often than not, with an odd name, who flies a plane for fun.
what can I do with this?
we can see her black panties. What terrible taste!
everything is excusable.
not everything, not bad taste.
suddenly, he wanted to touch her.
then, with a surge of emotion, he felt like strangling her, to set her straight, then and there.
the other one, too.
bump both of them off...
bump them off? Yes, rid them of that liking, the foul liking for provoking me.
just a second. What on earth are you thinking?
thinking about that again? Stop it right now!
stop thinking about it, please!
there, calm down, Georges, pal.
you know what it has cost you in the past.
so calm down, all right?
what will I do with her?
I have her name, address, and so her number, if she has a phone. Of course she has one.
everybody has a phone.
no, not the poor. There are a lot of them.
she isn't poor. Flying costs a lot.
she'll need to be in the phone book.
I hope she is.
I can call her and say...
let's see...
say to her...
my name is Georges Palet. Have you lost something?
you have. What?
a wallet. And?
no, not that.
say...
I know...
my name is Georges Palet. Have you lost something?
you have?
Hello, I'd like to...
or may I, or could I...
or could I possibly...
no, rather...
could I speak to Marguerite Muir?
no, to Miss Muir. To Miss Marguerite Muir.
then say to her...
I know...
no, I don't know.
I'd like to speak to Marguerite Muir.
speaking?
well, hello, Miss. Madame?
that's what I feared.
what?
nothing.
who are you?
well, my name is...
no, spare her the name. Just tell her...
I'm calling you because...
because what?
who is this?
Georges had come home to call.
he no longer had the right to leave.
he had no rights.
he couldn't even vote, but he didn't mind that.
what he did mind...
no, nothing.
he didn't mind at all.
well, yes, what he did mind...
no, let's not even think about it, if possible.
if only he could have forgotten it.
he wished he could.
he'd waited his whole life to stop thinking at last, about anything.
that's what he wanted from her.
thinking of her was like thinking of nothing.
it's her, my God, it's her!
you're dreaming, pal. It can't be her.
you fool, she doesn't even know you.
for her, you don't even exist.
I've been trying to reach you for an hour now!
I doubt it, I'm just starting.
starting what?
go on. Starting what?
calling.
calling whom?
the woman with the wallet. - What woman?
what wallet? What is this?
I don't know yet.
why did you call?
something wrong?
don't you feel well?
want me to come?
I'm busy, but if you aren't well...
if something's wrong, I'll come.
there's no need. Why did you call?
tell me first. - No, you first.
no, you.
what woman? What wallet?
I'll explain.
no, explain now. You sound odd.
me, odd? - Yes.
what's happening? - Nothing.
I went to change my watch battery and found a wallet.
I'm trying to call the girl. She must be worried.
it's needling me, see. I'd like to reassure her.
but it hasn't been an hour yet.
so, why did you call?
about the lawn.
what about the lawn?
the children are coming on Sunday.
I didn't know.
I'd like you to mow the lawn.
central POLICE STATION
anybody here?
anybody here?
what are you doing?
I called out.
go back to the other side, please.
back around the desk.
what's it about?
could you close the door? We can't hear each other.
are you injured? Were you mugged?
to steal my wallet?
for example.
so, were you mugged?
no, I dislocated my shoulder trying to get my mower started.
electric, electric, that's the best.
a wire, a plug... No nasty smells, no noise.
but people get electrocuted.
they run over the wire, and boom, or so I've heard.
perhaps, but I was only saying.
Yes.
Yes. Anyhow, why are you here?
Bernard, are you coming or not, damn it?
a celebration?
a promotion.
I'll be going.
no, stay!
what were you here for?
Yes, I was here for...
could you close the door?
just a minute!
so? You were here for?
what's going on? Why did you leave like that?
you turn up, you leave... What's going on?
come on, now.
come with me.
look at me. You were here for a reason?
Yes.
so tell me all about it.
something to drink?
no, thank you.
all right. I'm listening.
well, I found a wallet.
you have it here?
of course, but you know...
what?
nothing.
here it is.
where did you find it?
where? In the shopping center car park.
any money in it? - No.
I know, that photo isn't...
but look at the other.
there's that, too?
look.
I guess.
she looks like Hélène Boucher.
who?
an aviatrix from the thirties...
Paris-Saigon solo, seven world records, an acrobatic ace, fatally injured during a training flight.
you know your stuff.
I read about her as a boy.
leave me your phone number and address.
just in case. There may be a reward.
a reward? What reward?
for the...
are you going to let her know?
this evening? Right away?
it's a little late now.
what's your name?
Palet, Georges Palet. P-A-L-E-T.
Palet.
Georges.
your address?
he's recognized me, I can see he has. It'll come back to him.
what do I do? Kill him?
and what's your phone number?
thanks for doing the lawn.
if that's all it takes to make you happy.
something wrong?
that wallet... Did you take it in?
Yes, but I'm worried.
I wanted to reassure her myself.
wouldn't you worry if you lost all your papers?
you bet.
but what can you do?
you took it to the police.
did it go well?
Why?
no reason.
they'll let her know. Don't worry.
Yes, but after how long?
how long will it take?
I'd have let her know right away, see?
Yes.
one point in my favor.
it's ridiculous to wait.
so try again.
calling someone?
Yes, that woman.
this late?
how do I look?
very nice.
sure? Not too much makeup?
no, you look lovely.
put the meat on! They'll be here soon.
it has to get going.
put it on anyway.
fine, but it won't cook.
seen the ash tree? It's started sprouting.
I've seen.
pass me the meat. - I'll see to it.
you can set the table.
do you think Elodie is happy?
Yes, she's happy.
they have two children. She isn't unhappy with him.
then again, with her, you never can tell.
I find Elodie's husband very kind.
a decent guy.
where are they?
they're here!
I've seen.
sweetheart...
are you well? - Yes, and happy to see you.
you look beautiful. - Thank you.
how's my little girl? Happy? - Of course.
look.
he chose it. - Really?
how's boxing?
training for the championship.
something to drink?
we could use "tu" now.
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
do you mind?
no, I was just asking.
use "tu" to say what? We're fine like this, aren't we?
come on, have a drink.
ready for seconds?
thank you.
wasn't Marcelin coming?
we're expecting him.
we won't wait.
he'll be here soon.
with him, you never know.
come down to the club to see a fight.
I don't know. Maybe.
with Marcelin!
you know me and boxing...
I'm training for the championship.
what were you talking about?
I'd like to use "tu" with your father. But he doesn't want to.
my father's like that.
right, Dad?
wasn't Marcelin coming?
with him, you never know.
a garden's great.
a garden's great.
Hi, everybody.
I'll get it.
may I speak to Georges Palet?
dad, it's for you!
who is it? - Some lady.
she didn't give her name? - No.
what did she say?
she asked for Mr. Palet. Georges Palet. Is that you?
Yes, you fool. You're Marcelin Palet because I'm Georges Palet!
nothing to be proud of.
hello. - Yes?
I'm listening.
actually...
I'm calling because...
because what?
to thank you.
what for?
just a second. Didn't you find my wallet?
I did. - All right.
well, I wanted to thank you.
is that all? - What else?
I don't know. You could... - What?
I don't know...
feel like meeting me.
what for? I don't see any need to.
I'm not surprised. - What?
I'm not surprised!
listen... - No, I won't listen.
you disappoint me.
what's wrong with Dad?
he's...
I don't know. What could be wrong with him?
he should take up a sport.
near the tennis courts,
Georges realized he was perhaps doing something stupid, something not quite right.
come down to the club one day.
to see a fight.
if you're interested.
my father's like that.
right, Dad?
I'm so ashamed of that phone call, of the way I reacted.
let's see where she lives.
I'm so ashamed of that phone call, of the way I reacted.
so ashamed I fell ill on a Sunday.
Suzanne had to send for a Sunday doctor at the Sunday rate.
I can't tell her that. It's not possible.
she mustn't read it!
I don't want her to read it!
what on earth are you doing?
you'll break it, my boy!
who are you anyway?
I don't know you.
I've never been here before and...
and what?
and I've never done this before, but I have to get my letter back.
can you help?
my dear fellow, even if I wanted to, I can't.
is it that serious?
serious? No, what is serious? No, it's not serious.
but I'd prefer her not to read it.
so it is serious.
do you know her?
by sight.
what's she like?
I mean... In real life?
don't you talk?
hello now and then.
if you see her, could you tell her...
you have a letter, from a gentleman.
what gentleman? - He didn't say his name.
Really?
no, he just said that he forbade you to read it.
fancy, and why?
no idea. Give it to me.
are you joking?
I have to tear it up!
it's mine.
she didn't add, "Now." But she thought it.
she read it. She didn't die of it. One doesn't die of that.
reading never killed anyone. It helps you live.
she replied.
she replied very kindly. A couple of words, three lines, a quarter page...
I consider the matter closed.
everyone makes mistakes.
it's part of our lot, to get ideas.
it took more than that to discourage old Georges.
he kept writing about what he believed his life to be.
he ended up believing it.
no, he believed it. He wrote it, so he believed it.
one has to believe to write.
and it's so real one ends up believing.
I don't know if I've already told you...
Yes, I have already told you.
I've already spoken about my old passion for flying.
I shared that with my father.
he dreamt of being a pilot, but ended up a motorcycle mechanic.
motorcycles don't fly.
we buried my father a week ago.
I wonder what I can talk about.
my mother is threatening suicide.
I don't dare...
she read his words but didn't reply.
two messages.
first message.
it's Josépha. The prosthodontist called.
he won't be ready by tomorrow. He's sorry. Take care.
second message.
it's me again. You're never home. I wanted to talk to you about everything and nothing.
but not about nothing.
as if we were having a drink.
Georges called every evening. Her answering machine always answered.
answering machines do that.
I heard my father saying, "Your mother tried to commit suicide.
I went to the hospital where I was born.
when I came over, she said, "Spare me that look. You'd never have the guts.
I call that a desire for murder. Don't you?
well, I must dash.
I have to put the ravioli on.
no more messages.
one evening, he caught her without her machine on.
she was there, in person, for once.
it's you?
I'm very glad to speak to you.
because... - Because what?
I'm asking you, begging you, not to write to me anymore, please.
leave me in peace.
no, that's impossible. Am I at peace?
not since I got to know you!
why refuse to see me? I won't kill...
eat you!
I wanted to make you stay.
to delay you, talk to you. I couldn't find a better way.
you know, I'm not an evil man.
when I realized what I'd done, I panicked. I'm running away.
but first,
I want you to know that I'm the one who slashed you.
no, who did this to you.
that was it. She was going to the police.
this is Marguerite Muir.
do you remember me?
I remember.
I came about...
I remember very well.
you have a good memory.
we have it here for you, from 8: 00 to 12: 00 and from 2: 00 to 5: 00.
I'm so pleased. I'm on my way.
I'm the person.
you called. I'm here for my wallet.
perhaps it wasn't you I spoke to.
Yes, it was. It was me.
this way.
you have it, then?
where did you lose it?
I didn't lose it, it was stolen.
my bag was snatched.
do you have my bag, too?
I'm afraid not.
where did you find it?
the thief emptied out your bag. He found nothing.
he got rid of the bag. He took the bus.
why the bus?
he emptied the wallet. He found the money.
was there money in it?
three fifty-euro notes.
he dumped the wallet in the car park.
which car park?
the shopping center one.
which shopping center? - In L'Hay-les-Roses.
Yes, I know where that is.
that's so far from where I live!
he probably spent it all on CD's and tapes.
Yes, that's possible.
well, anyway, sign here.
and in the future...
I'd like to know who found my wallet.
I'd like to thank them.
Mr. Palet, Georges.
what's he like? As a man? Just being curious.
is he young or old? Just being curious.
please, it's only natural.
an individual aged around fifty, average height, slim, almost white hair, with eyes, let me see...
light-colored, yes, very light, kind eyes, but odd.
a lined face. Something must have wasted him, perhaps an illness or a big problem, a very big problem.
in short, an odd fellow indeed. I didn't understand all he said.
but, the main thing is...
you said it.
you have a good memory.
what's the problem? Have you been attacked again?
not exactly. Well, yes. That's why I wanted to see you.
what's wrong?
nothing too serious but it's taking on such proportions...
I thought that maybe I could stop by to see you.
of course, but tell me what's wrong.
well, this fellow, this man, this gentleman...
the gentleman who found my wallet...
Yes, what about him?
this is so awkward.
is he demanding a reward?
in a way, yes.
how do you mean, in a way?
is he propositioning you?
threatening you?
no, well yes, well no. Oh, you're getting on my nerves.
pardon me?
he's demanding to see me. - And?
he wants to know me. - That's all?
he keeps writing to me.
he'll calm down.
he won't. Yesterday morning...
what happened?
he came to my street.
he slashed the tires on my car.
now that changes everything.
that's much more serious.
you must come in to see us.
that's what I want to do, but not to press charges.
you have to make a statement.
I don't want any trouble. He's probably a decent man.
I'd just like you to talk to him.
is that possible? Can you do that?
and repaint the attic door, too.
you know, the dormer window. Understand?
you see what I mean?
forgive me, that's not what I meant.
I'm late, I had a bad night.
you'll do it, then? I can count on you?
Yes.
see that plane?
that's a Cessna Skylane.
230 horsepower, 270 kilometers per hour at top speed.
1, 700 kilometers on a full tank.
and put some newspaper down. For the drops of paint.
come in, it's not locked!
is it my wife?
no, no, don't worry. We just want a word.
I'll come down.
do you recognize me? - Of course.
I didn't from above, with the cap.
but now I do, seen face on.
repainting the house?
my wife wants to change the gate and the door.
the rest has to match.
put something new in something old...
in an old house, I mean, and you have to replace everything.
it's true. You have no choice.
the previous stuff, the old stuff, soon becomes unbearable.
you should just grow old and let it grow old with you.
that's what I would have liked, but my wife...
you're married? - For 30 years now.
I even have grandchildren.
I see this is going to take a while.
we'd better sit down.
coming?
lead the way.
come in.
let me tidy up.
something to drink?
no, thank you. You neither?
no.
all right.
but, if you don't mind,
I'll have a quick one.
have a seat.
living with a wife and kids in an apartment...
a house is better, but the upkeep...
it's good to sit down. Being up a ladder wears your legs out, keeping yourself steady.
I'm not afraid of dying, but of falling.
of surviving.
my right foot really aches. I must have hurt myself.
I was steadying myself with it.
let me take a look.
see that?
do you remember the wallet?
you bet I remember it!
and Miss Muir, you remember her?
Yes, her, too.
have you met?
no, she called me one Sunday to thank me.
for what, God knows.
I couldn't talk. My daughter was here. With her husband.
my son, too. He doesn't have children.
he has decided not to. I understand that.
to reproduce what?
we couldn't talk much.
I mean, her and me.
she thanked me, and that was that.
I see.
have you heard from her since?
why would I?
you could have. - Yes, you could have.
Yes, you could have. - It happens.
you get acquainted. - You talk, call back.
or write. - Yes, or write.
Yes, or write.
did you write to her?
you get acquainted.
you talk, call back.
or write. - Yes...
or write. - Yes, or write.
did you write to her?
you get acquainted.
talk, call back.
or write. - Yes, or write.
Yes, or write. - Did you write to her?
listen. We're here to help you.
to stop you from doing anything stupid.
something stupid?
do I look as if I would?
look at me! Look at the state I'm in!
if I could, do you know what I'd do?
the same thing my old neighbor did!
on the dole at 50. Married, two kids. He blew his brains out!
boom! Bang!
his wife's remarried. They're redoing the house!
see what that means?
it means...
Oh, damn it.
listen, all that's very sad.
but Miss Muir came to see us. She told us everything.
that's not possible.
she didn't do that. Not her.
she did.
the bitch.
I mean it, what a bitch!
I didn't mean her any harm.
neither did she. She didn't even file a complaint.
she isn't even asking you to refund her costs.
she just wants to be left alone.
she has requested us to ask you that.
so I'm asking you.
will you?
shit, shit, I'm sick of this bloody life.
well, is the answer yes? Will you?
Yes.
you promise? - Yes.
can we count on you?
no worries, then?
I said yes.
that's a fine paint job.
a beautiful color, isn't it, Bernard?
don't you like it?
doing everything in blue?
it's nearly over now.
go ahead.
you're hurting me!
it's over.
you can rinse.
I never promised you'd get your milk teeth back.
look how handsome you are.
like at the barber's.
I was going to say something silly. - What?
I was going to say...
no, it's too silly. - Say it anyway.
I was going to say I can smile at you now.
I was even going to say next time, too.
but there won't be a next time.
but you'll be back, won't you?
no more visions of you bending down over me to fill my teeth...
how sweet.
off you go now. It's late.
meet Josépha Belotch.
doctors Muir and Belotch.
two old friends. Inseparable.
pastimes, Josépha, the theatre. Marguerite, aviation.
a world, a gaping chasm.
and their view of men.
why the smile?
it's old Schwer.
another last-minute decider.
it changes nothing, but it gets on my nerves.
he made a very pretty declaration before he left.
by the way, any news of your... Your brutish suitor?
no. No more news.
you sound as if...
Yes, that's how it is.
I'm sorry I acted the way I did.
I'm worried he'll get into trouble.
all right, I'm coming.
I'm disturbing you. It's very late.
I hope I didn't wake you.
is this Miss Muir?
Yes.
but how on earth did you know?
the voice...
the voice.
I still don't understand.
Georges talks to me a lot about it.
he describes it, and, believe me, Georges can be very precise.
and...
and I was really hoping...
I can tell you, since you're there.
it's just the two of us, two women.
I was hoping you'd call.
Why?
why were you hoping that?
may I talk to him?
probably, but not now. He isn't here.
where is he? - At the cinema.
an old war film near the Place d'Italie.
about a US Navy pilot during the Korean War.
the Bridges at Toko-Ri.
the pilot, shot down, has to be brought back at any cost.
his pal comes for him by helicopter.
the Koreans wait for it to land.
the two men reunite. No shelter.
gunfire. The Koreans kill them both.
I'll call back.
the film ends in half an hour or so.
it's not far from here, thought Muir. What if I waited for him?
marguerite had half an hour or so.
she didn't have any doubts.
she knew she'd recognize Georges.
without ever having seen him? Yes.
your coffee.
thank you.
a double espresso this late...
after the cinema, nothing surprises you.
anything can happen. It doesn't surprise you.
anything can happen as naturally as possible.
you love me, then?
no, no.
it's just...
what?
don't look like that...
what?
nothing.
I was saying, it's just...
I was worried about you.
that's right. Deep down, you can worry without loving.
can't you?
Yes, why not?
but can one love without worrying?
Yes, that, too.
how did you know I was here?
your wife.
Ah, yes, my wife.
a kind woman, isn't she?
she's more than that.
Yes, well.
what do you want exactly?
to have coffee with you.
it feels odd to be walking together.
you've barely met. You've spoken on the phone.
let's call it speaking.
you'd given up hope of meeting.
now you're walking together, not very straight.
you could almost take each other's arm.
how was the film?
is that all?
I was a boy when I first saw it.
Really?
And?
nothing, it did nothing for me.
not even the two friends' death.
war is like that...
don't you think?
how about you?
the planes?
I don't have much time at the moment, but I hope to fly again soon.
perhaps not next Sunday, but soon.
you should come.
with your wife.
with my wife? - Yes.
I'm sure she'd like that.
with my wife.
I see. - You see what?
isn't Doctor Muir here?
no, she's been held up. Please come in.
thank you. - You're welcome.
because of Georges, that conversation...
you sweep aside the important reasons.
you focus on details.
for instance, instead of thinking, what on earth did I go there for?
you think, "My hair didn't look good."
maybe he didn't like my nose.
he had looked at it as if he'd never see it again.
I hope he didn't see my teeth.
things like that.
did he notice my feet?
what's going on?
nothing. - Are you ill?
no.
well, I don't think so.
a patient asked if you were ill. It surprised me.
it's astounding.
seriously. What's going on?
nothing. - How do you mean?
nothing, okay?
what about your patients?
I couldn't care less. - Really?
you couldn't care less?
honey, without patients, no money.
without money, no plane. Thought of that?
let's think about it.
she had bought an old Spit. A Spitfire.
dating from the war. A beauty.
in need of renovation but magnificent.
with Mickey and a few others.
five, with Mickey. All crazy about engines.
they needed 60, 000 euros, peanuts, and a pilot.
muir volunteered. The boys applauded.
not only for the money. They knew how Marguerite flew.
they had seen her at work.
me, too.
I'll pick you up at 1: 00.
why don't you use your knife?
what's wrong?
is that him?
is that him?
Yes.
I see.
I'll talk to him, you'll see.
no, no, don't.
stay right here.
Oh, Lord, I'm tipsy.
leave her alone.
who?
come on, we're leaving.
so seductive.
he has so much talent.
and genius?
please return to your seats.
what? Were you talking to me?
if Georges had been here...
don't start that again!
I want to see him, you hear? I have to.
what do you mean, "have to"? - Don't worry about it.
I'll call him. - Call him tomorrow.
no, not tomorrow!
I want to see him now.
at this time of night? Are you out of your mind?
could I speak to Georges?
is that Miss Muir? - Yes.
it's very late, but could I talk to him?
he's out.
at the cinema again? - No.
I have to talk to you. - To me?
now?
but...
please. It won't take long.
well, if you really think so.
why not?
this is absurd. What'll you say to her?
don't worry. Wait here.
you're exactly the way I imagined you.
let's have a cup of tea, shall we?
couldn't you park better than that?
I'd like to get through to my house.
so it's you?
what are you doing? Waiting for me?
no, for Marguerite. - Really?
your car, honestly...
you, on the other hand...
let me release you.
bringing them home now?
of course not.
she's Marguerite's friend.
what's your name again?
Josépha.
forgive me, but I'm parched.
could I have a glass of water?
of course.
come with me to the kitchen.
thank you.
what are you doing in my home?
Oh, no.
don't shout, because if you do, I'll start shouting, too.
and we can't start shouting.
by the way, how was it?
not bad.
futile but not bad.
I could see her coming.
I knew she'd try to have me one of these days.
I made the first move. That way it's settled.
go now. I never want to see you again.
you understand?
never mind, we'll have loved each other well.
you're hurting me.
you're hurting me.
same time Thursday.
you hurt me all the same.
see you Thursday.
you're hurting me.
you're hurting me.
you're hurting me.
you're hurting me.
you're hurting me.
stop! You're hurting me!
close your mouth now.
someone will take care of you.
there's a patient in my office.
could you finish up? I'm leaving.
I'll be in touch.
where are you going?
where are you going? For God's sake, tell me!
miss Muir.
is that you?
is it really you? Just fancy...
how long has it been?
I've come to see it. Can you let me in?
three, four...
Margot, greet the moon
greet the sun and the stars for me
take off, the aircraft flies away
above the hangars and the rooftops
Margot, greet the moon
greet the sun and the stars for me
it's us!
Oh, Lord, they're so silly... You can be so silly.
Oh, you're top-notch mechanics, but you're four fools. Four idiots.
but I'm fond of you, really very fond.
give me a kiss.
what about me?
no way.
what do you say, boys?
shall we let her drink her coffee?
Hello, Josépha?
no need to ring like that, I'm right here.
hadn't you seen me? - I had.
well no. I shouldn't have?
will it wear the bell out?
you're thinking of the bill? Do you want me to chip in?
seriously, do you want me to?
carry on, you interest me. - There's a start to everything.
are you gardening?
what do you want?
I've come to fetch you.
me? What for? To go where?
not just you, I wouldn't have come otherwise.
I'll ask again. What for? To go where?
there.
where?
where? You're making me repeat all my questions?
I'll ask again. Where?
where Marguerite is.
who?
cut the crap, she sent me here.
to do what?
to drive you there.
where?
to the field.
what for?
she's flying and wants you... Well, Suzanne and you...
Ah, it's you.
I wondered who you were talking to.
to her.
miss Muir would like to take us flying.
what do you think?
that's an excellent idea.
no sooner said than done.
sit in the sun and we'll be all yours in five minutes.
miss Muir is flying.
she's taken someone up for a first flight.
no, a discovery flight.
we don't say first flight.
it's a discovery flight these days.
we'll wait for her on the field. We'll see you later.
don't forget, I'm expecting you all for lunch.
no later than 1: 00. My veal stew won't wait.
you too, of course.
don't be too long.
have you seen? A Spitfire.
just think! It's a Spit.
lf you say so. - I'll take a look.
stay here or I'm going, I'm cold enough as it is!
alright, calm down.
there she is.
she's beginning her turn. You see her?
I need to take a leak. Where do I go?
over there, in the offices.
I'm going for a leak.
delighted to hear it!
well? Was that fun? - Yeah, it was.
thank you.
did you like it, Zambo dear?
isn't Georges here?
hello.
I'll give you a kiss.
your husband hasn't come? - He's in the little boy's room.
I see.
I have to call in at the office.
I'll be right back.
with the demonstration, I was scared you wouldn't come.
we have to go, don't we? Don't you agree?
Yes.
want to sit in the front? - No, you.
sit in the front. - No, I said.
you're not coming? - Certainly not!
go without me.
line up on runway.
takeoff, 90 kilometers per hour.
ascent, 130 kilometers per hour to 300 feet.
enter flaps. Cut pump.
engine speed, 2, 600 rpm max.
ascent, 140 kilometers per hour without flaps.
speed, 2, 450 rpm.
do you want to take over?
Oh, no, please.
I'm here, there's no danger. I'll be watching him.
well, do you fancy trying?
acrobatics, you don't do them here. They're not allowed.
there are special places for that.
and this plane, wasn't designed for it.
for acrobatics, you're wiser using a CAP 231 Mudry, for example.
mummy?
there are rats in the basement.
Ow!
Willard...
what are you doing?
I'm going to bed.
it's late.
Yes. I'm going to bed.
good night, mom.
what were you doing down there?
you, uh, said there were rats.
well, did you see them?
Well...there aren't any rats.
there are.
all our neighbors moving away...
and all these new people remodeling the houses.
they're stirring up rats.
Well...have you been to the basement?
no. You know I can't.
I know they're there.
I can smell them.
all my life I could smell mice.
Smell...mice?
and hear them.
don't you hear them down there?
it's--it's just the wind.
there aren't any rats.
come in here. Hmm?
come in here.
I'm sorry I've been such a bad mother to you.
well, you've--you've been a...
well, you are... a wonderful mother.
it's my fault your life was wasted.
Willard.
what an awful name--Willard.
maybe if you had a stronger name...
that Frank Martin wouldn't push you around...
or maybe you'd have found a girlfriend...
if you had a more handsome name
mark or Kyle or...
Clark.
Willard, from now on, your name's Clark.
good night, Clark.
pardon me.
that you?
sorry. They told me to sit here.
Willard, he wants to see you.
Oh. Well, um...
ms. Leach, it seems that someone...
this girl, is sitting at my desk.
maybe that's why he wants to see you.
OK.
Hey. Pay attention.
yeah?
who's that at your desk out there, Willard?
I--I don't know her.
sit.
who did you say that was at your desk out there, Willard?
I--l--I don't know her.
well, you should know, because it's your fault she's there.
you've fallen at least a week behind...processing the purchase orders.
you know, when that happens, Willard...
everything comes to a standstill
my salespeople up on the floor...
shipping, receiving, inventory.
everybody's standing around... with their thumbs up their asses...
because you have allowed the purchase orders...to bottleneck at your desk.
your father built this company, Willard.
hell, your family name is still out there...on the side of the building
martin Stiles Manufacturing.
Ah, hell, it just seems to me like...
that alone would make you take...
a little more pride in your work.
well, l...
Oh, my mother is sick.
I see.
so, it's your mother's fault that you've fallen behind?
Willard, I'm an old friend of the family.
hell, I've known your mother since before you were born.
she's a fine lady, and she deserves to be kept comfortable.
your dad was like a father to me.
and I promised him that I would always...Iook after you and your mother...
and as long as she was alive, you'd have a job right here.
and in keeping with that promise...
I must insist that you find...a good rest-care facility for mom.
we can't afford that.
but, hell, I guess you could always sell the house.
here's an idea--I'd tear it down and build apartments on it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Martin. I'll--I'll--I'll...
I'll catch up. I'll stay late.
Oh, yeah. You would love that, wouldn't you, Willard?
suck up on more overtime than it even costs me for a temp.
you'll catch up, all right, asshole...
and you'll catch up on your own damn time!
there's one thing that you will never understand, Willard
business is a rat race.
promise or no promise, I will not allow myself...
to be devoured by all of those other rats because of you!
Clark! What is it? What is it?
shh, shh, shh.
it's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.
here we go.
what was all that noise?
rats?
no.
a bird got stuck in the house somehow, and I let it out.
it's all right now, so go back to bed.
what are you doing in there?
I'm going potty.
you've been in there a long time.
I'm not feeling well, mom.
is it loose or hard?
I'm OK. I'm OK.
so just--just go to bed.
let me see. I'm still your mother.
Clark! Clark!
you should be in bed.
you're feverish.
I get afraid, Clark.
your father was in that bathroom late that night.
Yes, I know. I'm never going to do anything like that.
what is that on your hand?
it's--it's soap.
it's cooking oil.
Oh, Willard, you're too old for that.
when will you find yourself a girl?
well, other than getting caught in the trap...
you seem pretty--pretty smart.
you should be called... Socrates.
what do you think?
yeah? All right. Socrates.
whoa. Like it in here? Oh.
where are you going?
Bye, Socrates.
say hello to your family.
you're reunited with your brother and sister and mom.
look. Look, everybody.
food. Food for everybody.
there you go. Very good.
Bye.
Socrates...
I will never let anyone harm you ever.
I promise.
I promise.
I promise.
Martin, I have to cover your damn car every day.
cover my car. Cover my car."' Ugh!
do you like my new S-55, Willard?
my new car. My new Mercedes. I saw you drooling over it.
Oh.
uh, yes, Mr. Martin. It's...
do you know why I have that car?
I'm driving that 350-horsepower, V-8 masterpiece...
for you and your fellow employees.
you see, buyers feel a sense of security...when they can see proof...that they're dealing with a successful man.
so, when I whip into that parking lot behind the wheel...of my brand-new Mercedes AMG-class...
they'll buy from us over the slob in the Jaguar S-type.
do you know why I can afford to plunk down 90, 000 bucks...for that little edge over the competition, Willard?
because I'm a successful man!
because I have never been late for work a day in my life!
because when I come to work, I don't show up...in one of my dead father's cheap suits!
because I have never given my boss such grief.
maybe it wouldn't hurt you to find out what pleases me!
are you OK?
Hi, Socrates.
it's been a bad day.
tear it, Socrates.
all right...
you teach them.
they listen to you, Socrates.
tear it.
tear it.
tear it up.
jeez. You're big.
big Ben.
do you know him, Socrates?
Ben, this looks like the beginning...of a beautiful friendship.
tear it.
tear it.
tear it.
OK, everybody, that was really good.
speed. Speed.
very good.
Rope...up.
tear it.
you go down there. Go on now.
down. Down. Tear it.
in.
still.
out.
one week! You've been late for so many hours...that it equals an entire week!
Mr. Martin, l--I'm sorry.
I want my week back.
I've discussed it with counsel.
I may not be able to fire you, Willard...
but, by God, it is well within my rights to administer...physical disciplinary reprimand!
I know that you must be tired of this excuse...
but what can I do? My mother is sick.
you don't give a shit about your mother!
if you did, you'd show up for work on time...
because now look what's happened.
you're out a week's pay.
Oh, you don't like that. Then quit.
act like a man for once in your life and just quit!
you're a slimy, pukey piece of shit!
you wouldn't make a pimple on my grandmother's tush!
Willard.
in.
in.
No!
Ben, no.
if you get in, nobody else will be able to fit.
in.
be careful, stupid. We're not making a bed here.
all available units, please respond immediately.
21 1 in progress-- 316 Glenview Parkway.
out.
door.
tear it.
tires. Tear it.
Ben, I told you to stay.
you--you won't fit.
what the hell is that?
you left the washer in the garage running again, didn't you?
in! In!
come on. Come on.
anybody out there?
is someone out there in the garage?
Oh, shit! Look at that!
somebody got in here and slashed my tires!
Damn!
who's out here?
Yeah, you better run!
you don't mess with a man's brand-new car like that!
run, and you'll only die tired!
you better run faster...
because if I catch you, you are dead meat!
quiet!
go home!
do you want to see what's in the bags...
you stupid little dog?
the look on his face.
imagine, all four of his tires.
do you know what a set of those tires run?
insurance will cover it.
but insurance won't cover how pissed off he's gonna be.
Hey, what's up?
someone broke into Martin's garage last night...
slashed his tires and peed on the floor!
morning, Cat. You look very nice today.
Wow. Someone--someone urinated on the floor?
no, no, no. You know, what happened
when Martin goes in his garage...
and sees his tires, he pissed his pants...
and blamed it on the guy that did it.
do you think that's funny, Fox?
Ahem. Good morning, Mr. Martin.
is everything OK?
no, everything is not OK.
how would you like it if some maniac...invaded the privacy of your home...and scared the dog shit out of your wife...and then you had to lose an entire night's sleep...because you're dealing with the cops?
knowing that that perverted sicko has control...over you and your family's peace of mind?
for Jesus and Christ, for how long?
how long will it last? No, I'm not all right!
this morning, I rode the subway.
well, Mr. Fox, how would you like that?
no, sir, I wouldn't like that at all.
I didn't think you would.
barbara, I need a foot massage.
Oh, that's so good. That's so good.
foods.
foods.
we, um...
we're running out of room.
I'm very sorry about this...
but I can't--I can't feed you anymore.
I can't afford it.
you're going to have to find a new place to live.
go find somewhere more comfortable.
I wish that they didn't have to...
but all good things must come to an end.
follow Ben. He will find a new place for you.
he will take care of you.
won't you, Ben?
you're the leader...after Socrates.
good night, Ben.
you're not going anywhere, Socrates.
you'll always be with me.
I hate everyone but you.
let's go to bed.
Ben, I told you. You can't come upstairs.
now, it's only Socrates, not you.
Oh, Socrates.
Aah! Don't touch me!
you're getting rid of me.
mom, l--I love you.
I heard you!
all good things must come to an end."'
no, l--I love you more than anything in the world.
you don't love me! You won't feed me!
I hate you!
you need to go to the hospital.
what if mom sees you?
no.
mom?
mom?
off. Off. Off.
off. Off. Off.
off.
down! Down! In the basement!
down! Down! Down!
in the basement! Down!
you think you're funny? You think you're smart?
socrates, he's smart.
he knows that they're going to have to come...
and they're going to have to take her away...
and then they'll come, and they'll take me away...
and then they'll come, and they'll take you away!
Hi.
she's my mother.
I love her.
and I'll miss her.
I already miss her.
but, Socrates...
if you ever died, l...
you're the only friend that I've ever had.
well...
at least you're with father again.
I have a friend.
see?
he wants to say good-bye to you.
say good-bye, Socrates.
that's good.
Willard.
in.
Willard, are you all right?
Yeah.
I didn't mean to upset you.
you didn't have to come here.
well, we didn't hear from you...
and I wanted to make sure that you were OK.
uh, and I want to let you know that...
you have a friend.
Willard Stiles, I am Joseph Carter.
I'm an attorney with Montgomery and Glitt...
the trustees of your mother's estate.
I've been trying to reach you, but you don't answer the phone.
may I have a moment with Willard, please?
do you mind if I check on you after work...
and make sure that you're OK?
Oh, l--thanks. That's OK. I'll be OK, Cat.
Willard, I have some news...
I don't know if you're aware of or prepared for.
your parents had been living off an account...
they had originally set up for your future.
it was intended to be yours upon their passing.
however, your father's death left debts...
that even Mr. Martin's buyout did not completely relieve.
in fact, there remains pending litigation...on some unsettled debts.
well...
it's--it's still my house.
your mother refinanced the house...after your father's death.
ln fact, we still owe-- -"We"?
it's my house.
we can declare bankruptcy. We can sell the house.
it's my house! -Yes, of course.
you grew up there. It's your home.
but it's the bank's house. -It's my house!
there's no need for a single man...to be living in such a large house, Willard. Sell it.
why do I have to pay for what things my parents did?
the money can help you start over.
start over"? I'm almost done!
Willard, look. You have no choice
if I have no choice, why did you even come here?
why did you even bother telling me?
do you get off on telling people...
that they have no control over their lives?
that I have no money, no home, and it's not even my fault?
Willard, this is not the time nor place.
now, you think about it.
then, please, you have to contact me.
this is the only chance you have...to take control of your own life.
thank you.
Socrates.
Ben!
Willard, it's Cathryn. Answer the door.
I saw you walk in.
Oh, hi. -Hi.
I'm just on my way out.
I have some stuff that I have to do at the cemetery.
Oh, well, this might not be the best time, Willard...
but please don't take this the wrong way.
you looked so lonely at your mother's service...
and I remember how devastated I was...you know, when my mother died.
and the only thing that helped me through...
Was...her mother.
this is Scully.
she'll make a great friend, and she'll keep you company.
Oh.
I don't know what to say. I...
I can't accept Scully.
see? She likes you.
well...
why don't you hold her?
just take her. Just hold her.
really, I can't. I'm sorry.
just take her. -OK.
well...
I'm really late, and...
do you think it's OK if I just put her inside?
sure. She's potty-trained. -Oh, good. Good.
Socrates.
it's OK.
it's OK.
I wasn't...really trying to hurt him.
I know.
you're trying to keep the peace...
but he has to learn... I am the boss.
it's back to work, Socrates.
Ben, out.
OK, Ben...
just because Socrates says it's OK.
here we go.
here we go.
am I reading this correctly?
Mr. Stiles, it is our regret to inform you...
your position has been terminated.
enclosed please find two weeks' severance.
your service is appreciated.
Frank Martin."'
he's firing you.
but I thought he couldn't fire you.
Willard.
Hey. Hey!
this whole thing is just one big misunderstanding.
I'll make it up to you, though.
I'm gonna take you to the Jets-Dolphins game.
how does that sound? -What?
feels like this office could use a little holiday cheer.
Cathryn, go dig out the Christmas decorations.
they're in the back storeroom.
the key's in Willard's desk somewhere.
talk it over with Rosie and let me know.
I'll be right here at the office working late tonight.
Christmas bonus time, you know.
Mrs. Leach, found the keys...
but you can dig out your own holiday cheer...
and then you can shove it up your ass with a big ho-ho-ho.
I quit. -Bye-bye.
how could you?
what part of "You're fired" don't you understand?
my father! -ls dead. Been dead.
and now your mama's dead, too.
he started this company! It's my family's company!
no. My company. Been my company...
and I don't want you around it anymore.
why in the hell are you even still here?
you hate it here. I hate you being here.
you're going nowhere here.
mommy and daddy are dead.
get over it and get on with your life.
the terms of your purchase contract
they strictly state that you are not allowed to
sue me.
get you a goddamn lawyer and sue me. You'll win.
go down today and hire yourself a $250-an-hour lawyer.
sue me. My $400-an-hour lawyer will tie it up in the courts until I die.
so, what? 10, 15, 20 years from now, you'll win.
you know I cannot afford that! You know that!
need money? Make me an offer on the house.
don't give me that face, Willard.
I buy the house, you have money.
you can go buy yourself a very nice clean used car...
move someplace where you'll be happy...
get a job, a girlfriend.
jeez, you'll be so damn happy you won't want to sue me.
all right... I'll sell you the house.
but, please, please, please let me keep my job!
please! Please let me keep my job.
please.
what in the hell is going on now?
a rat! A rat in here! Oh!
it's a rat! Oh, my God!
rat! Look out!
there's a white rat...
and it is the size of a dog--I mean, huge dog.
over there, behind the Christmas lights.
see him?
where? I don't see any mouse.
no. Up there, you idiot.
up there!
I think your wild-ass imagination...is kind of getting away with you.
he's up higher.
there he is.
No!
Walt, this is Mickey. I'm coming to join you.
Yeah.
what's the matter, tiger? Can't take a little blood?
ha ha ha ha! Finders keepers.
nice work, Mr. Martin.
Yeah, good one, sir.
he expects me to clean that up?
I'll do it.
Thanks.
what could I do?
what could I do?
what could I do? What could I do?
what could I do? What could I do?
what could I do?
what can I do?
what can we do?
in.
in.
that's it. We can't fit any more.
the rest of you are going to have to wait here.
Ben and I will be back later.
right, Ben?
Oh, Jesus.
Ooh...I like that.
Ooh, look at you.
Oh, my God. Look at all the rats.
Yes.
look at the rats.
we've come to see you.
we?
they'll do anything I tell them.
well, then tell them to get the fuck out of my office!
sit down.
now, you listen to me, Willard.
sit down!
what the hell's wrong with you?
Mr. Martin, you stole this business from my father.
it killed him, and it killed my mother.
and now you're trying to kill me.
no. That's
you never let me alone for a minute.
you made a fool of me in front of everybody.
and now you're trying to take my house.
you made me hate myself.
I thought a lot about it...
hating myself.
well, right now...
at this moment...
I like myself.
you killed Socrates!
who the hell is Socrates?
he was the only friend...I ever had!
what's the matter, tiger? Afraid of a little blood?
tear him up.
good-bye, Ben.
food.
food.
I think I hear footsteps. -Yeah.
let's look around back. -OK.
Willard? It's Cathryn.
I've been calling you all day.
did you hear?
Martin's dead.
they called from the office.
the details are weird.
all kinds of rumors...
that he was murdered or attacked by animals.
I'm hungry.
could we get something to eat?
right now?
let me get my coat.
just a second.
could I use the restroom?
Cathryn?
in here.
sorry. I had to go so bad, and you flew off somewhere.
we need to go.
shit. I must have run over something.
there he is. -You sure that's him?
Yeah.
get in the car.
I'll call triple-A.
I've got a cell phone.
Mr. Stiles, police. Open the door, please, sir.
can you please tell me what this is about?
Willard!
open the door, Willard!
I want to help you!
Willard!
Willard!
open the door, Willard! Let me in!
what's going on in there?
I hear him going around back.
Stiles.
Stiles!
I'm sorry, Ben. I...
I'm sorry that I left you.
I got scared...
and so l--I came back here.
it's all over, Ben.
you can live anywhere.
you can go anywhere.
I have nowhere.
who's he talking to?
there was nothing that I could do about Socrates.
But...we got him back.
we got Mr. Martin back together.
this guy's nuts. We should just call Bellevue.
it's all over, Ben.
so just...go!
go away!
Whoa! It's not just Bellevue.
we've got to call the health department exterminators.
you see that?
Oh, man.
let's go.
do you want some food?
I'll give you some food, Ben.
I'll give you all the food that I have...if you'll just go away.
do you want food?
no.
no, no, Ben. It's food.
it's just food.
whatever food is in the bag is yours.
Ah! That's it for you, Ben!
I hate you!
I loved Socrates, but I hate you!
I'm not setting foot in there. There's, like, a thousand rats.
ma'am, you want to get eaten alive?
Martin.
if you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
if you need help, hang up and then dial your operator.
Cathryn, help!
help!
Cathryn!
Cathryn.
Ben.
I thought we were friends.
food's here.
food.
look, Stiles, you've got to eat.
you might be out of your mind, but your body's staying here.
eat.
come on. We got some nice chicken...
some mashed potatoes...
got a sourdough roll.
Hey, look. We got a piece of cheese.
that's what the mice eat, isn't it?
OK, rat boy.
look, I'm gonna leave it here.
you can do whatever you want with it.
Hi.
Shh.
I know you're hungry, but we have to wait.
our time will come.
let's not let them know that you've come back to me.
we have to sit here...
and wait
wait...
we could be together whenever.
are you talking about an affair?
we got to get up early. We're fishing at dawn.
now come on, listen... - I don't know.
what's the big deal? You lied to your wife already.
come on, honey.
Hey!
just take him, okay? - He's not mine.
I know! Just take him anyway!
what am I doing here? - Surprise.
how are you? How's NYC? Where are you staying?
my mother just bought this apartment.
she totally lied to me about why we're here.
I'm stuck here alone.
Wow.
wait a minute, how did you get here?
short plane trip, long cab ride.
I can't.
I'm not ready.
I'm sorry. I should go.
I like you.
Where's Zoe?
I don't have her.
you said that he'd have her. What are we supposed to do now?
the unaccounted-for dollar is mine.
I play all the time. I even have a witness who saw me put it in. Here you go.
I made these mimosas. - What's your phone number?
dad, it's me.
I'm coming home.
you don't have to pick me up.
if the key's still under the mat,
I'll see you later.
I left the key outside.
stay here.
sorry, you can't go inside.
but my father lives here. - Who's your father, honey?
dad!
what happened?
Frankie, Frankie, Frankie, you shouldn't be here.
I shot someone, baby.
I shot somebody.
sunny, I'm sorry.
is she going to be okay? - Hey, get him away from her.
is she going to be okay?! - Put cuffs on him
wait! Wait!
Frankie, Frankie! - Yeah.
on a charger, my cell phone.
my lawyer's number, okay, call him, baby.
call him. - Okay.
Ellen, Ellen, this is my daughter, Frankie.
I can't deal with her right now; help her.
I don't even know where my car keys are.
you have no shoes on, and your shirt's inside out.
look what the police did to my sister's apartment.
they needed samples, I guess, for evidence.
and they don't even have to fix it?
they can't find her, they can't do anything, but they're allowed to come in here and just ruin her home?
tally, what are we doing here?
I mean, what are you doing here?
are you gonna stick around? Because if you are, you should probably find a place to stay.
I mean, you could stay with me if you need to.
I need to wait here.
not that I think she's gonna come back any second, but...
she might.
Yeah.
it's possible.
what can I do? I mean, tell me, I'll do anything you need.
just find her.
I already tried.
try harder.
to the police, she's just some girl, but to you, she meant something.
didn't she?
Yes.
then don't give up on her.
please, Sean.
find my sister.
NINA: I hope this is okay.
if I'd known the house tour was going to turn into lunch,
I'd have gone food shopping.
or bought furniture.
no, really, it took almost as long for us to decorate our house as it took Dave make partner.
which is why I had to make partner.
see, honey, one was supposed to happen before the other.
so did you hear back from New York about the bike business? No.
I'm gonna go with a small investment bank firm.
Nina, this grouper is amazing.
Peter caught it in Mexico.
have you ever gone on one of those famous fishing trips?
no. I would if they'd stay at a different hotel.
there's no television, no phones...
I mean, how do you call for room service?
no phones? We talked every day.
on my cell.
no, Peter, I called you... - Yeah, on my cell, honey.
remember?
so how come your phone didn't work at 1: 00 in the morning?
different carrier.
NINA: Well, that was awkward.
how did you know to cover for him?
can we just drop it?
did you see him with someone? - No.
is it a girlfriend he keeps down there?
no.
she was a professional, someone they flew in from Las Vegas.
a prostitute?
I didn't do anything, if that's what you're asking me.
I didn't think to ask.
why didn't you tell me?
I need this guy.
those investment bankers are not taking me seriously, and he's hooking me up with high rollers.
so what is this, one hand washing the other?
maybe we don't want to get our hands wet in his dirty water.
Frankie: So this lady, Ellen, is telling me that she's heard so much about me, and I'm thinking "Really?
because I haven't heard anything about you.
but there's her bra on the floor of my father's living room.
wait, so she wasn't the one who got shot.
no, that was Sunny. - Right.
she was naked.
at least that's what the cops said.
I heard them joking about it.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
I'm just so tired. I...
can we go to your hotel room and go to sleep?
um... - I mean just sleep, would that be okay?
uh, yeah, it would, but, um...
but what, the, um... the no-sex thing?
I mean, is that... - No, no, no...
is that really gonna bother you?
no, it's not that, really.
it's, um...
I kind of had this whole day, uh, booked...
you know, planned.
um... it's just impossible, that's all.
doing what?
you know... guy stuff.
a lot of guy stuff.
that was...
I mean it was, right? - Mm-hmm.
Yeah. - Good.
Hey, so what-what number am I?
cause I'm numb two and Freddie's one?
Freddie... No.
first of all, it's Frankie, and we're not... I mean, that's not really what I meant, but...
you mean how good? Number one to ten? - No, no.
that would be awful.
I meant, um... I meant the number of guys.
you know, 'cause you're... older than me, so I...
I was just curious, but if you don't want to say...
do you?
you watch a lot of TV.
you play a lot of video games.
you really find it that entertaining? - No.
I'm learning English.
well, how many languages have you learned from watching TV?
japanese is hard with characters.
but not counting Japanese: five.
EDDIE: I'm a P. I. not a forensic accountant.
okay, but just, look, all right.
Zoe and this lawyer Park stashed millions in offshore accounts.
there's got to be a trail.
I don't think the cops have even looked at that angle yet.
and this surprises you, cops not chasing down a lead?
I'm not saying there's anything there, I just...
look, I don't know what happened to her, okay?
but I do know it's not good.
either way, her sister needs to know.
you don't want to leave the stone unturned, and you shouldn't.
but you need to know it won't be cheap.
I charge a hundred an hour for any legwork and $60 for time on the computer.
Yeah, yeah, look.
I don't care, all right?
I do not care. Whatever it costs is fine.
and don't be pissed, it's standard procedure...
but after you called, I ran your credit.
it's not a pretty picture.
like I said, I thought I was coming into money.
and like I said, it's a hundred an hour.
look, I have work lined up, okay?
I do, I will pay you.
are you going to help me or not?
I need to know where Zoe is.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
James, my man, you got to take it easy.
Hey, when you're done,
I want you to take a look at these new listings the realtor sent.
there's this gorgeous contemporary, but it's not good for kids.
it's like trying to dress a monkey. - I still love this old colonial.
Uh-huh, well, Beth, I'll take a look at it later.
I'd rather you look at it now.
no, no, no, no, I got him.
I've had the website flagged for three days.
come on.
and what's wrong with this house?
we won the lottery, Cameron, and we're still renting.
Yeah.
besides, I don't want to move when I'm pregnant.
too much stress. - All right.
what are you doing here?
rehab sucks.
I knew that going in.
I guess what I mean is I... I suck at rehab.
do you think he's warm enough in this?
Oh, my sweet baby.
Oh, I missed you so much.
come here.
hello...
I think he's asleep.
we're about an hour ahead of his nap time.
he's just relaxed with his mama.
you have him sleeping in here?
it seems to help.
he was a little beyond that developmentally.
Elisa, I left a message for you caseworker. - Yeah,
I called her when I got kicked out of rehab.
she's, uh...trying to get me into another program.
what happened?
my boyfriend visited...
...and I used.
you have to get away from him.
you think?
so what are you going to do until you get into another program?
after his nap, I was going to take him home.
Elisa, you can't do that.
I can, actually.
my sister flew in, and she's staying with me.
she's got temporary custody of him till I get clean.
I-I thought you didn't have any family.
well, I don't when I'm using.
they made that very clear.
damn, just when I'm getting him to sleep.
I'll get it.
no, I'll go.
it's probably the Social Service lady.
I figured you'd want to talk to her, make sure I'm not lying.
wait a minute.
I don't understand.
you asked us to take care of your child.
and we did, as you barged your way into our lives, blackmailing us.
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.
you want to hold him for a second while I get his stuff?
Hello?
no, he's not here, I'm his wife. Can I help you?
Yes, I know a Sunny Van Hattem.
she told you what?
Oh, here we go.
sunny, you have a visitor.
what are you doing here?
well, the hospital called and said that you gave them Peter's name as a contact.
I did?
Mm-hmm.
Peter... Peter like your husband?
Yes.
can you stop? I can't...
it must be the stupid pain medication.
it makes me nauseous and apparently delusional.
I really gave 'em Peter's number?
well, he wasn't home, so, um...
if there's anything that I can do to help.
Yes. You can get me out of here.
well, Sunny, you were shot. You can't just walk out of here.
well, my cousin went to the hospital for an appendectomy and wound up dead.
I'm sorry.
she had sepsis and...
this place is crawling with germs.
all right, I'm calling the doctor.
you do that.
Hey, could you get me some clothes, please?
nurse, can you tell her she can't leave?
while you're at it, why don't you tell her how you can't find a vein with a shovel.
we can't force her to stay, but we do ve a release process.
bill me. I'm a millionaire.
Jerry, please leave
what's the word-- um, soccer.
american football is like gorillas fighting.
like your accent.
where you from? - Russia.
business or pleasure?
or both?
what?
look, the accent's a turn-on, but don't let it kill the deal.
I'm asking you a simple question.
you working or aren't you?
you think I'm a prostitute?
easy, easy.
get away from me, dirty man.
what's going on?
this man, he say I'm a prostitute.
you get the hell away from my wife.
your wife?
I.I'm sorry. My, my bad.
it was an honest mistake. - Jerry, I want this guy out of here.
no, need, no need, brother. I'm gone.
are you okay?
look, forget it. He's just an idiot.
not only him.
it happens many times, Damien.
what?
they see me there sitting at bar.
no job, no family, no man.
what should they think, huh?
why give respect?
I'll take care of this right now.
ADDIE: So this woman, Ellen, whom your father just handed you over to without calling me...
I told him not to call you, okay?
I said I was fine.
with a total stranger?
she could be as unstable as he is.
dad's not unstable.
don't let him hear you saying that if he's pleading temporary insanity.
the police aren't even pressing charges, okay?
it was an accident.
it wasn't, Frankie.
he panicked, because this town isn't safe because lottery winners are being targeted.
which is why we are moving to New York...
permanently.
what?
no, I'm not going.
sweetheart, I'm sorry.
but this is not yours to decide. You're a child...
well, Dad's an adult, and you gave him shared custody.
he'll never agree to it. - Frankie, he already has.
you work here?
I thought this was your home address.
Oh, yeah, it's um...
you know, it's kinda both till, uh.till the rent's paid off.
look, I might have found something.
I ran your friend's social, got some account numbers and traced 'em for recent activity.
okay.
someone used her MasterCard three days ago outside of Santa Fe.
are you sure it was three days ago?
that's, that's three and a half weeks after she disappeared.
maybe it doesn't mean anything.
numbers get sold and cloned, but it is from an existing account, not a new one somebody opened up in her name.
or maybe whoever took her's in Santa Fe.
maybe she's there, too, right?
maybe, but it's going to cost me to get there and find out.
airfare and travel expenses, it comes to about three grand.
I'll get you the cash, okay?
just book your trip.
I don't want you selling your blood to pay for what might be a goose chase.
let me worry about that, okay?
just book your trip.
book it.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't get anything back.
the police kept it all for evidence, so...
not even my coat?
God, that was brand-new cashmere.
you know the bullet st missed my liver?
bastard Eric should fry for this.
the news said it was an accident, Sunny.
whatever. Here.
I couldn't get through to anyone.
look, Outpatient Care is sending a nurse to your house, and I got you some meds from the pharmacy.
I sent my mother on a cruise.
I don't want her to know what happened to me.
she should know that you were hurt.
well, she shouldn't know how.
God, what an idiot I was.
just take me home.
okay.
who's going to take care of you?
sunny. - What?
you can't be alone.
don't you have any other family, friends who can be with you?
the home nurse will be there soon.
that's not the same.
no, it's not.
we have a half a dozen bedrooms, but no extra beds.
I hope you're okay here.
Oh, are you kidding me?
with a little bit of morphine and these two fabulous nurses, never better.
this is the get-well dog and the get-well rabbit and get-well hamster.
can you get him some morphine, too?
NINA: Girls.
tomorrow night, can you sleep in our room?
let's go downstairs.
peter: How's it going?
got the message from the hospital after they called here.
apparently, you two have patched things up.
we did a good thing, Cameron.
Yeah. You try to help somebody out, that's what the money should be for, right?
it's her baby.
we need to let go, move on with our lives.
have a baby of our own.
Beth, I just need a second to feel bad about James and...
and think about what might happen to him if Elisa doesn't stay clean.
no amount of money can control that.
Anthis month we have 12 to 24 hours if we want to get pregnant.
from now?
it's just a window.
I've been keeping an ovulation calendar.
I don't deserve you making me feel better about this.
I did agree to let you move, Frankie, but I had no choice.
But.but you're my father, you have rights.
if she won't listen to you, go to court.
I've had enough of lawyers for one week.
not that I wouldn't fight for you, but because of the shooting, I can't win.
but they're not charging you.
your mother would make a meal of this.
she would say I'm an unfit parent with an unstable home life.
you know, she's the one who's dragging me away from you, my school, my friends.
it's the money.
it's tearing us apart bit by bit.
well, maybe if you let go of the winnings and let Mom have them, she'd stop trying to take things from you.
things... like me.
Oh, Frankie, I would give everything I have to keep you in my life.
will you tell her that? - It won't make a difference.
she's got a team of lawyers and millions to pay 'em.
I can't win, Frankie.
Hey, I got your message, you sounded all pumped. - Yeah, yeah, come in, come in.
now, this might not mean anything, but...
I hired a P. I. and it looks like he found a lead.
what kind of lead?
well, we're not gonna know until he tracks it down, but I gave him money to do that, and he said he's gonna call my cell as soon as he finds out.
he found activity on Zoe's credit card.
all right, somebody in Santa Fe used it three days ago.
three days ago, Tally.
which credit card? - Uh. It was a gold card, but it was hers, you know the account is definitely one she had.
what are you...
first thing, as soon as I got to town.
are... are you sure? - Positive.
I canceled all of them, because they said credit cards were like a LoJack for missing people, like a homing signal.
: son of a bitch.
that P. I, You lied to me.
call the caps Tracy.
you lied to me.
you'd sell your soul for $3, 000.
did you find anything?! Huh? Did you even look?
there's nothing to find-- no leads, no trace of her.
a lottery winner goes missing, it's a big case.
the police did their job. The trail is dead.
you want my opinion? So is she.
Oh, my God!
DAMIEN: So, what do you want to eat?
because I am starved.
I'm too excited to eat.
I love my wedding ring. - KIMBERLY: Damien?
Hey, Kimberly.
Yeah, hi. - Hi.
do you stay here, too?
Yeah, yeah. It's nice, right?
Yeah, it... yeah, it is.
you're Galina.
Yes. Hi.
you know, I saw you down at the spa the other day,
Wow.
is that a...
Oh, what a beautiful ring.
Yes. Damien just buy it for me.
he's sweet, no? - Yeah, he's sweet.
the diamond is real, ah?
I'm really married.
I see that. Yes.
Yeah. Congratulations.
thank you. - Okay.
well, I'm gonna go. - It was good togood to-to see you.
you, too. 'Kay.
see? She believe, ah?
listen, the... the ring is actually for the guys so they won't hit on you.
um, ring on, you're married, they'll leave you alone;
ring off, you're available.
yeah?
: well, which you want, ring on, ring off?
me with other men?
me without?
: well, I'm-I'm not sure if it's any of my business.
because you're a business husband.
we marry just for money, no?
then what business do we do in bed?
because if that is part of job, I am prostitute.
to me is not job.
Hey, neighbor.
Hey.
Yeah. - Yeah.
then again, you can afford it.
big on the smokes, huh?
I am when there's reason to celebrate.
they travel easier than champagne.
did a kick-ass tour of the factory, my friend.
two out of the five investors want in.
Really? - Mm-hmm.
wow, that's incredible. Hey, Nina!
Nina, come out here!
so, um...how much are they in for?
well, we only talked preliminary numbers.
Eliassen's still on the fence, which sucks because he's got the deepest pockets.
my advice, throw a little party, thank the investors, wine and dine the holdouts.
NINA: Sweetie, what's going on?
Oh, hey, honey, listen, um, we're almost there with the investors on the bike venture.
Oh, that's great.
how would you feel about helping me throw a little party?
you know, I'm sorry,
park: Who's Sunny?
Oh, she's staying with us, she's one of the lottery winners.
Arguably.
let me see what she needs. but yeah, - A party sounds great. - Cool.
I'll have someone in my office draw up preliminary deal agreements.
Oh, no, Dave, I couldn't ask you to do that.
we'll work something out.
look, I don't want to pressure you with fees, so if this is something you want to continue, we can work out a percentage deal. It's not a problem.
you mean, you.you would own part of the company?
park: Hey, I'm happy to back away.
but these guys know me, they trust me.
Yeah, it's just, you know, beeen, you know, you and the investors, it seems like I'll barely own 50% of the company, - Maybe lose control of... - It's a little more complicated than that, but...
NINA: Honey?
could I talk to you for a second?
it's important.
stick around.
NINA: Excuse us.
NINA: How did Park get a piece of this bicycle business?
he's a criminal lawyer.
well, it's his connections who are getting it going.
look, Nina, if I went with an investment bank, they'd want a cut, too.
what about Cameron?
I mean, has he said for sure that he's not interested?
I don't know about Cameron and what his plans are with the money, do you?
no.
look, Park cheats on his wife, you hate that.
I get it.
but in the business world, he believes in me.
I wish you could do a little more of the same.
mom?
I need to talk to you. - Uh, excuse me.
sweetheart, what's wrong? What are you doing here?
I'm not going to New York,
I'm not gonna let you use this money to bully people and buy new friends and boyfriends...
okay, okay, wait, wait, sweetheart, calm down.
dad doesn't care about the money.
did you know that?
you've put him through so much hell, he doesn't even care about millions.
is that so?
he loves me.
he would do anything for me. He wants me to be happy.
but I don't want to talk about this now.
but all you care about is punishing him.
how much is gonna be enough, Mom?
how much is it gonna take to make up for the fact that he didn't want to be married to you?
why don't you ask him how much it took...for him to let go of everything we had, to walk out on his daughter at the most crucial timein her life?
but he left you, not me. - You're right
he left me.
but he gave you away for $200, 000.
what are you talking about?
I said to him, "Eric, I'm worried about her.
what's it gonna take, Eric?
and what I meant was, or whatever happened to Zoe to happen again?
but he named a figure-- he wanted the money, and he named his price.
no, you're lying.
sweetheart, I wish I were.
but that is who your father is.
and pretending otherwise is a lie that...
I'm sick of telling.
Hey.
thanks for meeting me here.
you all right? - Yeah, I am.
but, um...
Peter needs you, as a friend and as a business partner.
I'm not too good at either right now.
well, he's hooked up with this shark, this lawyer, and all these high-flying investors, and...
you know, he's so eager to prove himself, but he's out of his depth, and he could lose everything.
I can't let him fail at this, Cameron.
I don't think this is such a good idea for us.
well, this isn't about us.
everything I do, including what I don't do, it's...
it's all about you.
you can't believe what I'm putting on hold, waiting for you.
can you imagine a time when you wouldn't be with Peter?
I can't answer that.
well, I need you to.
cameron, marriages fail all the time.
will mine? I don't know.
I hope not.
don't wait for me.
and don't... don't root for it to happen, not if you care about me.
but do this for you, right?
that's what you want.
at a time in our lives when I should take Beth and the money and get as far away as I can, you want me to go into business, a partnership, with your husband, knowing that it's only gonna bring me more into your life?
is that what you want?
Yes.
Peter, the caterers are here.
I told them to start serving as soon as guests arrive.
Oh, be sure that I introduce you to Eliassen.
he's the investor that Park's bringing, okay?
Oh, my God, Daisy!
Where's the nurse?
DAISY: Aunt Sunny fired her.
she's not really your aunt.
get downstairs.
Oh, my God.
and you're sure the machine won't let her OD?
well, she seems pretty out of it.
okay.
fine, I'll just... I'll let her sleep.
Yeah, thanks.
are you okay? How are you feeling?
yummy.
GALINA: Come in. - Yeah.
come in.
um, can I ask you something?
did you mean that before about not seeing other guys?
Mm-hmm.
well, I mean, I'm 17, you're 25.
I can't even imagine how old your last boyfriend was.
41
Really? 41?
see, I mean, so why would you want to be with me other than...
I don't know, money?
you are a nice man.
nicer to me than... any man.
ever.
DAMIEN: Hello.
Hi. Um, I'm downstairs and I just...
I need somebody to talk to.
can I come up?
hold on. I'll be right down.
okay.
it's okay.
I don't say you must decide between us.
nice crowd.
you can tell they're "suits" even in their party clothes.
just acquaintances.
I know I wasn't exactly invited, but I came here because...
...I want in.
I mean, if the door's still open.
you mean the business?
cameron, the door's always open.
you've been looking out for me since I was 14 years old.
what would I do without you, huh?
come on, let's go get a drink. - Thanks.
my mom went and bought my dad off.
I hate them both.
I want to go away.
can we?
what do you mean?
let's run away.
just you and me.
we can go where... - Whoa, whoa, slow down.
slow down. - Well, why not?
I mean, we have money.
let's just go to California or Hawaii or any...
just stop... just stop for a second.
you can't do that, okay? You can't... you can't just leave your mom and dad.
why not?
I mean, you did.
I'm... no, I'm diffent. - How?
Frankie, I'm not the answer here.
you need...
you need to find someone else.
you need to find someone more your own age.
you're only one year older than me.
I'm not the right guy for you anymore.
so... thirsty.
waiter, waiter...
what is that?
that would be a lottery winner.
so thirsty.
Yeah, um...
sunny: Please.
have a good time.
I'm a freak show, right?
life's just a little strange for all of us right now, Sunny.
I keep hoping I'm just going to wake up and realize that I dreamed the whole thing.
did I dream the whole thing?
no, but I'll tell you this. you're a survivor.
you never let go of that IV pole.
well, that's good.
a nurse should be coming.
she's going to check the shunt, but, uh,
I think you came out okay.
you're amazing.
you're a little high.
you've got everything.
you have a beautiful house and happy kids and a really great guy who loves you.
well... Two guys, really.
two?
I may be on morphine, but I am not stupid.
I'll get you another blanket.
thank you. - Mm-hmm.
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just looking for the bathroom. Is everything okay?
you need a hand?
no, we're fine.
there's a bathroom down the hall.
Oh, thanks.
there's three more downstairs.
sure.
BETH: You're finally looking at those houses. - CAMERON: Uh-huh.
but that's the one that's not good for kids.
I want the front porch and the big backyard.
I want what Peter and Nina have-- or had before they bought that gigantic mansion.
I don't think I can do this.
have a child?
why not?
because we're not in the right place.
I'm not in the right place.
then tell me where that is, because I will do anything, Cameron, to get there.
you question everything.
every decision you've ever made.
including the one to marry me.
to get past it, you have to act on an impulse.
and you'll spend the rest of your life questioning that.
it's not that simple, Beth. - Do you think I am?
I know you. And I chose to marry you, anyway.
because I love you.
a choice based on love.
no matter what happens in our marriage, I will never regret that.
you don't know that.
I know that.
I've had years of practice.
I know we're on shaky ground.
a child won't help that.
this can't be some fix.
it's a choice, Cameron.
based on love.
Hi.
I'm sorry I didn't... call.
is it okay I just dropped by?
Yeah, yeah. It's fine. Come on in.
what happened?
uh, it's, uh... It's nothing.
um, I saw that P. I. The guy's a liar.
he's completely useless.
but it doesn't mean we can't get somebody else.
we just have to... - Sean, stop.
I need to tell you something.
Zoe's dead.
I just got a call from the cops.
they caught someone who was breaking into the lottery winners' houses.
some Russian confessed...to... to killing Zoe.
she's dead.
police! We're coming in!
Freeze!
don't move!
don't move. Put your hands on top of your head.
put your hands up. Put your hands on your head and don't move!
grab her. Against the wall.
what are you doing?
hands behind your back.
are you Galina Kokorev? - Yes.
you have the right to remain silent... - What are you doing?
anything you say or do - Leave her alone!
may be used against you in a court of law... - She's Russian.
she doesn't understand. Just tell me what you think she did.
your wife's being arrested in connection with the death of Zoe Reida.
that's all I can say. - Do we need a lawyer?
that's all I can say. - Damien!
what is going on?!
Galina, don't worry. - Don't let them take me.
Sean, what the hell just happened?
Colin Evett dropped his sponsor.
cameron: We sign Colin, we'd be set.
why don't you come with me?
to Belgium?
I need your support.
I just can't.
if there's any support that I can give you, anything that you need. Yeah, you... you should come.
race with me-- clean-- I believe you'll win.
Oh, so sorry.
I remember your face.
it was like I was seeing you at 17.
simpler times, right?
sunny came to Belgium.
Uh-oh.
I can't help but wonder where this is coming from.
Oh, God.
you're wondering if I'm pregnant.
what did Cameron say about Beth?
was he upset? Upset about what?
he didn't tell you she left him?
no.
okay, this is where we met.
it was so great.
I should have just married you.
I'll be back to stay...
one way or another.
DAVE: Tally's giving you the money.
and you're giving half to me or going to jail.
you understand that, right?
Yeah, I got that.
there were a number of withdrawals.
how does a dead woman withdraw hundreds of thousands of dollars?
tally: Sean, look at this.
the transfer went through.
$10 million into your account, minus half of what was missing.
I guess we're both rich now.
listen to me: after we pay off the taxes, we can use it to do some good.
I mean, we can start a charity in Zoe's name.
what if she's alive?
there were withdrawals of over $300, 000.
I told you already, it was the lawyer, Park.
he needs the money, he'd do anything to get it.
it still doesn't explain whoever it was who walked in on us.
I mean...
what if she saw us that day, at her apartment?
that's impossible.
if Zoe were alive, she would've already tried to come find you.
what if she did try and she saw us?
why can't you just at least consider it?
because a man already confessed to her murder, okay?
what else do you need?
I'm sorry, okay? I...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here.
maybe Zoe paid that Russian guy to confess...
tally, come on.
so she could disappear.
I mean, wouldn't you, after all she'd been through?
if she were going to do something like that, don't you think that she would have drained the account already?
well, where's your body?
he told the cops it was in the lake, why haven't they found it?
you want to go talk to him?
the guy that murdered your sister?
would you go with me?
well, I'm not going to let you go alone.
why do I have to go to the doctor now?
sweetie, because you're all healed and it's time to get those stitches out.
I've been meaning to call you.
Peter told me about what happened.
Peter told you. Yeah.
I'm fine. Really.
Hi, Violet. Hi.
I'm sorry, Beth. I really am.
well, it's a nice sentiment, anyway.
but the last thing I need right now is people feeling sorry for me.
especially you.
NINA: I ran into Beth this morning.
hold on, hold on. What happened?
okay, well neither did I.
I didn't tell her anything.
in fact, she asked me, even begged for the truth,
I lied to her.
on top of everything else I've done wrong.
we've done wrong.
you haven't done anything except tell me to go away.
not very convincingly.
you scare me, Cameron.
one minute, you're at my door, asking me to bwith you, and the next, your marriage ends and you don't even tell me about it.
I don't know where you are...
or what's inside of you from one minute to the next.
you know me. I'm not so sure I do.
maybe that's something Beth has over me
she can see into your heart.
Nina, my feelings for you have never changed.
but you're married, you want to work it out.
I get it.
do you want her back?
I don't have any right to ask her that.
you really don't, either.
I'm sorry that I came to you before I had my life figured out.
maybe that's what I need to do now.
Cal: 9: 00 on the weeknights, and 10: 30 on the weekends.
Ten-ten-thirty?
parties don't even start till 10: 30.
what about my Viper?
what, are you kidding me?
you're lucky I don't sell that thing right now.
but, Dad, I...
what?
nothing, I-I'm cool.
you think I'm a real son of a bitch, don't you?
no, I don't. Or maybe you think
I'm stupid.
maybe you figure you'll "yes" me to death, and then do whatever you want when I'm not looking.
dad, what do you want me to say?
you were right, okay? About all of it.
I went from hanging out with my friends at the mall to watching my Russian wife get arrested for murder.
and in between all of that, she stole, like, 20 grand from me.
this whole thing has been a disaster.
exactly like you predicted. Does that make you happy?
I'm not happy any of the stuff happened to you.
I tell you what.
keep your grades to a "C" average,
I'll let you use the car.
a... A "C"?
not, like, an "A," or a "B+,
just a "C"?
that's progress.
on the weekends only.
all right. Weekend days.
and the rest of the time, I'm locking it up and I'm alarming the garage door. Okay. All right.
all right. All right?
you won't regret it.
I think I already am.
ADDIE: And Marco was born and raised here in New York, Frankie.
Frankie: Aren't you going to the theater?
how about Rent? If you liked the movie, you'll love the stage play.
two hours of poor people singing? No, thanks.
besides, I'm feeling more Wicked.
I will go call about tickets.
Oh, Frankie?
are you up for the theater? Um...
I've got to finish my...
uh...
homework.
whoa.
you okay?
I got this stuff from this kid at school, and it's... potent.
excuse me?
like, seriously, just two hits and I'm just like... whoa!
: I mean...
I mean, you get high, right?
you're cool.
Frankie, um...
Oh, God.
please don't bust me.
how is Barefoot in the Park, fourth row center?
uh... sure.
great.
Frankie: He totally bought it.
telling your mom's boyfriend you're on drugs is gonna do what exactly?
Ugh, don't call him that.
but, anyway, he's probably telling her all about it in the cab right now.
and when she finds out he's lying, they argue, they break up, we move back home.
genius, huh?
and why can't you just reason with her?
you know, explain to her why you just don't want to live in New York?
tried that, and all I got was "You're only 16.
like I don't know what I want and she does.
and you're one to talk.
like you've never played games with your parents.
Yeah, well, I'm trying not to.
but, you know, whatever it takes to get you homeis fine by me.
girls: Daddy!
Hey, babies, how you doing?
peter: What did the doctor say to you, Violet?
that I might have a teeny-tiny scar.
you might have a teeny-tiny scar?
well, that doesn't sound too bad.
let me see this for a second-- watch this: Whoo!
how's it going?
just distracted.
the bid finally came in for the remodel.
it's steep.
Whew!
you're not kidding.
I don't know, maybe we're getting overcharged because we're lottery winners, and people know we can afford it.
not this much.
what do you mean "not this much?
it's too much.
I mean, I...
it's just... it's all too much.
I got too much going on right now.
I got production deadlines,
I have this big launch party on Friday night...
Yeah, but, honey, we've been talking about remodeling forever.
I mean, we love this house so much, we actually bought it twice.
I talked about it; you wanted something else.
that was when we first won, because we weren't sure what we were going to do.
but we explored other options and it didn't work out.
so... let's make the best home we can with this one.
INTERPRETER: First, Mr. Pisconov is very sorry about your sister.
and as to the money...
it's already been wired to Russia.
thank you.
there is more of it if you just tell us where Zoe's body is.
INTERPRETER: The money is for my son's education.
and the truth, the truth is free.
what does that mean?
I did not kill your sister.
but you confessed.
to the robbery, at the apartment of your sister and other place.
so you saw her?
I didn't expect her to be home when I went in.
and so I hit her very hard.
I'm sorry.
but I didn't hit her hard enough to kill her.
and when I left, when I ran, she was still there.
alive?
INTERPRETER: Yes, but very afraid.
wait, you...
you broke into her apartment, you attacked her, but when you left, she was alive?
then why did you tell the police you killed her?
INTERPRETER: To stay in this country.
it's not perfect here, but much better than in a Russian prison.
the other murder in Russia, it was just business.
I killed one crook.
what choice do I have?
prison here, prison there.
prison here is much, much better.
here, for breakfast, you get pancakes.
and two eggs.
BETH: Hi. Anywhere in there is fine.
Thanks.
Hi.
Wow.
you know, this place is a magnet for Lotto winners.
Yeah.
I'm staying here for a while.
Oh. Oh, that's nice.
thank you.
look, I just paid more for this dress than I did for a used car last year.
Wow.
are you going to Peter's launch thing?
you know, I don't think so.
uh, Cameron and I split up.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm just gonna stay here till I figure out what to do next.
okay.
well, I'm just down the hall if you need a friend. Oh.
Yeah, well, except for today.
I'm dragging Ethan out to look at some insane houses.
fun. Yeah.
you want to come?
sure, why not?
I'll call you. Great.
okay? Okay.
are you going to tell me?
or was I supposed to find this out on my own?
I spoke to the accountant.
just to make sure that you weren't spending too much on the remodel.
and apparently, you didn't have the same conversation when you decided to invest all of our winnings into this business.
we're going to get it back as soon as we hit the market.
you know, this really isn't about the money.
you lied to me.
I didn't lie to you.
okay, fine. You hid things from me.
what?
Oh, so this is my fault.
because I don't think to ask, "Peter, are you secretly spending all of our winnings?
you mean blowing it.
that's what you mean; why don't you just say it?
Oh, and hey, did there happen to be any prostitutes on your trip to Mexico?
I didn't do anything.
what about Sunny?
bringing her into this business without even telling me. Enough!
and going away with her.
Nina, I am doing all this because it means something to me.
well, doesn't our marriage mean just as much?
Yes, it does.
and I trust the same is true of you, because I give you a very long leash.
don't come in here and lecture me about trust.
Hey, Nina.
bad timing?
Yeah.
what is it?
armand is here for your fitting, but, um...
what fitting?
for your tux for the launch.
it's just to get the alterations right.
I'm sorry.
peter: I told you to prepare a party.
I didn't say anything about formalwear.
peter: You know, most of these guys haven't been in a tux since the senior prom, including me.
some of your employees, maybe.
but you, you have to impress your backers, the retailers, the media.
Oh, and I invited all of the lottery winners, too.
can't I just rent?
Peter, you're the CEO of a soon-to-be multimillion-dollar company.
you're going to be jetting all over the world, going to fancy-schmancy dinners and parties.
guys like you definitely do not rent.
it's just surreal to find out your sister might really still be alive.
but, hey, I'm just going to go and drop eight grand of her money on a new dress.
can't you at least give me that?
Yes, it would freak me out, too.
look, we don't have to stay long, all right?
I just want to show up with the other lottery winners.
you know, stop living my life in the shadows.
you don't believe him.
why would he just change his story like that?
because no matter how much he claims to like American pancakes, he probably thinks you have the resources to help him reopen his case, which would get him out.
trust me, you think you saw a guy that feels sorry for you, but all he saw was a very rich woman.
and money changes everything, Tally.
so I've noticed.
I don't know what to believe.
I know what you want to believe.
howdy, partner.
see you guys have been doing a little shopping.
hope we didn't spend too much.
what do you want, Park?
are you sure you want to have this conversation in mixed company?
Yeah.
okay.
you owe me nearly five million, give or take a few hundred K
I already advanced myself.
you took that money?
well, honey, "took" implies it wasn't already mine, which it was.
park: Right, Sean?
get out. We're done.
not until I get my cut.
so Zoe didn't take the money.
park: Well, considering the transfer happened after she was murdered,
I'm guessing no.
I want the funds wired into my account by the end of business today, okay?
then we can have a toast together at the party tonight.
you know, to, uh... celebrate all our good fortune.
mom?
ADDIE: In your room!
get in here now!
so where is it?
Where's what? What are you doing?
Frankie, don't play dumb with me.
Marco told me that you were high.
so what is it: Pot, coke, meth?
Whoa! Marco told you what?!
Frankie, look, I know you're under pressure with the new school, the divorce and adapting to a new city, but drugs are not the answer to anything.
mom, he's lying.
he told me you said so yourself.
What?!
why would I do that?
why would he make something like this up?
I don't know.
maybe to screw things up betweeus, so he can have you and your money all to himself.
he's not like that.
right, 'cause you know him so well.
Frankie, look, I would not be freaking out like this if I didn't love you.
well, then maybe you should love me enough to believe me and not him.
I will.
as soon as I get the results of this.
are you serious?
never more in my life.
so two months with Marco cancels out a lifetime with me?
at least now I know where I stand.
pick up, pick up, pick up.
LUIS: Hello.
Luis, hey, it's Damien.
what's up?
Hey, uh, so listen, LaDuca's going to fail me if I don't pass this calc test on Monday.
I need some help.
isn't it kind of late for that?
right.
uh, but, yeah, I was just thinking what if instead of you helping me study, what if I sat behind you, that way I could, you know, review your choices.
Yeah, well, Damien, isn't that cheating?
Yeah. Um...
but... what if I paid you?
you know, it would be like a business deal, you know?
Cal: Say good night, Luis. Crap. Dad?
you're monitoring phone calls?
Yeah, not all of them.
not that you'd ever believe me, but I was actually trying.
now what are you going to do, ground me till death?
what else can you take away from me?
Damien, you're my son-- I'm not trying to take things away from you, I'm trying to give you some self-respect.
how about you just start with plain respect for my privacy?
what, by letting you buy and bribe your way through life?
I can't lose you.
and I won't let you lose yourself.
dad, I'm not going to die just because I'm rich.
Damien, I want you to live well.
with things inside you, and accomplishments that you can't buy and no one can ever take away from you.
okay.
I'm never going to pass that test.
we'll get you a tutor.
I'll help you.
whatever it takes, we'll get it done.
NINA: It's me.
did you know that Peter sunk basically all of our winnings into this bike business?
I already know that he did. I'm just asking if you knew.
well, I thought you wanted me to help him with the business, not spy on him.
I'm sorry I put you in an impossible position.
you okay?
I'm just trying to sort things out.
why'd you call?
cause I find myself wanting to talk to you all the time.
look, it's going to be okay.
he may not have been straight with you, he's taken some risks, but Peter knows what he's doing with his business.
well, you've helped him in so many ways.
how? By going in there every day, pretending to be his friend?
you are his friend, Cameron.
Yeah, well.
I'm going to be a better friend to both of you.
if I'm going to go to the party, then...
and then what?
I'm gonna get away for a little while.
last time you said that, "a while" turned into six years.
where you going to go?
who knows?
buy a boat, sail around the world.
that's the thing you do when you win the lottery, right?
if that's what you want.
I'll see you there tonight.
maybe.
you are coming, aren't you?
I don't know, Cameron.
I don't think I can be around you and Peter anymore.
I can't keep hiding how I feel.
how do you feel?
well, I hope to see you there tonight.
I'd like to...
...say good-bye.
woman: And the bonus room makes a perfect nursery or sewing room, office, multipurpose room...
or what's that, um, what do you call it?
a media room.
plasma TV, Xbox.
boy: Wow! Hey, Ethan, what do you think?
Hey, Ethan.
look, a tree house!
I'm sorry.
it's been a very long day.
I'll go get him. Why don't I go show him the tree house.
you guys feel free to look around. Oh, okay.
hey...
come here a minute!
so it's just you and Ethan?
Yeah, yeah, you got that right.
his dad's not really in the picture.
he was a boyfriend, we were kids...
Oh, I didn't mean to pry, I just...
it's impressive, what you've done.
you think so? Yeah.
cause he's really driving me nuts today.
but you're great with him.
I'd be a lot better if I had a breather every now and then, somebody to play bad cop so I can ay good cop, you know?
say "no," even though we have millions.
now, there's a problem that there is no chapter for in parenting book.
I mean, I love my son, you know, I do, and I try to be the best mother I know how, but I...
sometimes I do wish that I didn't have to do it alone.
Oh, wow, look at that tree house.
Frankie: I can't believe my mom took her boyfriend's word over mine.
Frankie, you told him you were stoned.
she wasn't really supposed to believe it.
she even made me take this at-home drug test.
Ah, the cup.
so gross.
and when it came up negative, she got into this huge fight with Marco.
at least now he's out of the picture.
arrivederci, Marco.
so when are you coming home?
well, that's the thing: I'm not.
she said he wasn't the reason we're here.
so all that......was for nothing.
I told her I wanted to go home, and she said, "New York is home.
then she said I need to go make some new friends.
now, how lame is that? Completely.
I want you here.
so what are you gonna do now?
what else?
make some new friends.
mom... what are you doing home?
get down now.
everybody out!
everybody out!
now you're drinking?
I am so worried about you.
no... Mom...
I can smell your breath; you're not drunk.
well, maybe it's the drugs.
wait a minute.
you lied to Marco. You set him up.
if you think, in your 16-year-old mind, that if you act out enough I'll pack it up and go home...
how could you be so selfish?
me?!
God, Mom, what about you?
ever since the lottery, all you think about is yourself.
for once in my life, yes,
I'd finally like to live a life of my choosing, without having to worry about you or your father, every second of the day.
finally, this is my time.
what is so wrong with that?
nothing, except I'm still your kid.
which you hate.
no, I don't... Yes, yes, Frankie,
and I am sick of fighting.
I feel like that is all I have done for years.
maybe you should go live with your father.
you said he didn't want me.
I shouldn't have said that.
because you want me even less.
no, no.
it's just that I don't know how to handle you anymore without giving up who I am.
what's wrong?
is the sitter here?
Yeah.
she's playing a game with the girls.
Oh, well, you'd better hurry up.
we got to get going.
I told Cameron I'd be there a little early.
I know you're mad at me about the money, but tonight is a huge deal for me.
I know that, Peter.
and we're already running late, okay?
so if you could just please come on.
damn it.
I can't, Peter.
I'm not going tonight.
what, are you-you punishing me, now?
no, no, God no. Is that it?
that's the last thing I want to do.
I just don't know where we are anymore, and I can't stand there beside you all night, and pretend that things are okay when they aren't.
Nina... Sorry, Peter.
I can't go.
so what do you think?
we've come a long way from the potluck dinners.
that was the idea.
I just wanted everything to be perfect.
and, uh, expensive.
Yes.
but so cute, worrying about money.
you know, you got to spend it to make it, and we can definitely afford to spend it.
in honor of which,
I, I got you something.
just open it and say "thank you.
: bicycles. Ah, wow.
platinum bicycles.
you deserve it.
you're the reason for all of this.
let me do it.
it's, uh... it's not that I'm not grateful, 'cause I-I am, it's just, uh, it's just that, uh... you should be here with a date tonight, Sunny.
so should you.
no, I'm... I'm married.
I know that.
here you go.
now just relax.
you're gonna dazzle them tonight.
I know it.
but the good news is you can come home.
Frankie: Damien, you don't get it.
: she doesn't care where I go.
okay, then sit tight and keep your phone on.
I'm coming to get you.
how am I gonna pay for a ticket?
just leave that part to me.
Hey, Beth.
I'm so glad you came.
yeah? Mm-hmm.
felt like the right thing to do.
feels a little weird.
my first solo outing, and it's to my husband's company party.
I'm sure he'll be glad to see you.
I know I am.
well, to tell you the truth, that's why I'm here.
other people bought fur coats and cars, and look what you've made happen.
come on.
seat of honor this-a-way.
Ooh.
peter: You okay sitting next to Cameron?
sunny did the seating chart.
Yeah. Uh, is Cameron here?
I haven't seen him.
how about Nina?
at home.
don't ask.
sunny: Peter, there you are.
the Cycling World guys need some pictures.
uh, I have to go work.
okay.
where are you sitting, Sunny?
right here.
SEAN: If it helps, even just a little bit, you look amazing in that dress.
Yeah, well, like you said, money changes things, right?
you sure you want to do this?
like I also said, I'm tired of living my life in the shadows.
Where's my money, because I, uh, don't seem to be any richer than last time we talked.
Yeah, and you're not gonna be, because I'm not giving you anything.
you act like you're holding all the cards, Mathers...
or is it Falsone?
it's so hard to keep track of you criminal types.
try coming after me then.
call the cops, flip your witnesses.
let's get it all out on the table.
sure, I made some deals, but let's not forget, you were involved with a murder, okay?
Yeah, I'm not so sure that line doesn't form to the left.
what the hell does that mean?
that the worst mistake Zoe ever made was coming to you.
I think you had something to do with her disappearance...
maybe even her death.
you're out of your mind, okay?
you're desperate, you're broke, and you were when Zoe knocked on your door.
so tell me, did you hire that Russian, or did you just pay him to confess to something that you already did.
What?!
don't worry, we'll find our own answers.
come on.
you got all dressed up just to tell me that?
no, we got all dressed up to celebrate.
the truth's coming out.
tally may not be able to put her sister to rest, but I'm going to enjoy burying you.
you all set?
Hey.
let me tell you,
I am glad you're here.
I need somebody to talk me down off the ledge.
Ah, you're going to do great.
you got a friendly crowd.
investors, retailers...
friends, neighbors, your entire staff.
don't worry, people are rooting for you.
come on, let's take a look at the bike.
okay.
first one off the line.
came off this morning.
I was kind of hoping you'd be there.
Wow.
it's finally done.
look, I came here tonight 'cause I know how much this means to you.
so why don't you get up on stage with me?
cameron, it's been our dream, you know, since we were kids.
it's your dream.
what I mean is, you made it happen.
what about you?
I'm glad you feel that I helped you get here.
you have, Cameron.
you're my partner.
now I need to be a silent partner.
you know, with everything going on, and this thing with Beth...
I need to step back.
what are you going to do?
not make this night about me.
come on.
BETH: Ginger ale, no ice.
listen, thanks again for today.
thanks? Really?
Mm.
cause I-I was feeling pretty terrible, actually.
terrible? Yeah.
Why?
well, I was thinking about our conversation that we had, um, about being a single mom.
and, you know, I thought we were just talking, but maybe you were asking me something.
you know, like, is it something you're considering?
well, Cameron and I were trying.
or, rather, I was trying.
but I took one of those home pregnancy tests, and it was negative.
any sane person would've just accepted that, but I'd hoped.
anyway, the doctor says I'm not.
well, is that good or bad?
both.
you know, at first, I was relieved given where Cameron and I are.
but then I started to realize having a child is something I really, really want, no matter what.
with or without Cameron?
Yeah. I think so.
so what's stopping you?
Beth, you are rich.
we all are.
that means we can pretty much do whatever we want to do.
with or without whomever we want.
what are you saying?
well, I'm saying money gives us options.
opportunities.
you know, it can buy you the freedom to raise a child.
not to mention some damn fine DNA.
well...
you know? Yeah.
Nina, it's Cameron.
Hi.
just, uh, wanted to say good-bye.
I thought we already did that.
Yeah, I know.
I guess I was hoping you'd change your mind and show up tonight.
so this is it?
Yep, looks like it.
I care about you, Nina.
I'm sorry for any problems I caused you.
okay.
okay?
what are you trying to pull?
tally: He says he has a way to resolve this.
it's already resolved. This isn't a negotiation. I'm not giving you a dime.
everything's a negotiation.
you stated your position. Now it's my turn to make a counteroffer.
stop it.
stop, please.
you're hurting him! Stop!
stop it, please!
stop it!
you think I like doing this kind of crap?
I'm not a thug.
this is your world, not mine.
don't drag me into it again.
so you came.
well, Peter's a friend. Nothing's changed that.
I'm here for him.
well, that's sweet of you, Beth.
also had to prove to myself that
I could get on with my life.
I'm sorry.
you can stop saying that, Cameron.
cause I never know if you mean you're sorry for leaving me, or sorry for marrying me when you were in love with somebody else.
that must have been awful.
I did love you.
I do.
just not enough.
I hate that.
but I can't hate you for it.
I have to forgive you.
for me, 'cause I don't want to carry that kind of stuff around with me.
you know, I thought I could do this, but
I can't. I think I'm gonna go.
no, no, no, no.
I should.
see you, Beth.
Hi. I'm, uh, Peter Schaeffer.
first, uh, first off, thanks for being here.
thank you for helping me make a dream come true.
it's a dream that my friend,
cameron Walsh and I have had ever since we were kids.
I really want to thank...
I'm here, I'm here.
don't cry.
Oh, no, it's... it's the good kind of crying.
I'm just so happy to see you.
let's go home.
okay.
okay. Um...
do you think you could spot me for gas to get us there?
Yeah.
so we'll give Park the money.
I don't care how much.
it's worth it to get rid of him.
you can't get rid of guys like Park. He's a...
go into the bathroom.
Sean... Just go, okay?
man: Sean, open the door, man.
what the hell?
look, I just want to talk to you.
we can do it anywhere. You're bleeding.
what happened to you? Never mind.
what do you want?
I just want to talk to you without a gun pointed at my head.
we were friends. I'm here as a friend.
what do you say?
Yeah, all right, come on in.
all right, get to it, man. What is it?
someone's been asking questions about you, the murder on the houseboat, that lawyer you sent.
now, this girl
she seems to know all the players.
it's like she's been collecting evidence.
she who?
people described a girl who looks a lot like Zoe.
no. You're lying.
Sean, I saw her myself.
peter: Ladies and gentlemen, here it is-- the Eastland XL.
I couldn't let you leave without...
our timing has always sucked, hasn't it?
you know that?
I-I do.
you asked me once if I could ever leave my husband.
and the truth is, I don't know.
what I do know is,
I hate that I'm the reason you're leaving.
it isn't only because of you.
well, then, maybe...
maybe I...
I have no right to say this but...
I don't want you to go.
you knew it all along, didn't you......that Peter and I were falling apart.
he loves you.
if you want to be with him, it's nothing you can't fix.
what I want?
what I want is everything.
that's what you and I have in common.
no matter what it costs, or who it hurts...
this is a dream come true for them.
Yeah, well, isn't that the point of winning the lotto?
making dreams come true.
courtesy of Pascal, our new pastry chef.
why did you lie to me?
what is that?
it's you and your cousin Razmik making out in the back of the restaurant.
I don't think that he's her cousin.
I'm pregnant.
it's your baby.
go be pregnant somewhere else!
you can't trust her.
everything she says is a lie.
it's a pregnancy test.
it's positive.
I killed my sister.
it was an accident.
get in the car.
we can have a great life together.
Hey, no. Please...
you love him!
Yes, I do.
I gave you a home.
I gave you a family.
this is still my home.
I want you to go.
Nina, be sure.
I swear, I'll take you at your word.
we're done.
I don't know who this woman is, this pizza delivery person, but that unaccounted-for dollar is mine.
what's the best way to your house?
I figured you were married, and I just...never thought that would happen.
no, seriously.
when I first started working at the plant, before the lottery, part-time, after school,
I would try to get the hours when I knew you'd be there.
don't freak out.
it was just a crush.
I knew you were taken.
Yeah, um, about that.
I know that things are really new for you right now, so I'm not pushing for anything.
but there's, um...
there's something I want to tell you.
I lied about the lottery ticket.
you did what?
I said Kimberly's ticket was mine when it wasn't.
look, you have to understand why.
sunny, I defended you.
I stood up for you.
because you knew I deserved it.
no, because you lied to me and I believed you.
look, if you'd just let me explain.
what kind of person does that, huh?
who steals money from their friends?
well, that's why I'm telling you now, okay?
I know that you feel betrayed by everyone close to you.
and I don't want to be one of those people.
it's a little late for that.
who's that?
Sean? Is that you?
I didn't mean to scare you.
what are you doing here?
I need a favor.
at 10: 30 at night?
Oh, my God, Sean. What happened?
I got shot.
don't worry. It wasn't anywhere near here, okay?
you're not in any danger.
all right, you need to get to a hospital.
I'm gonna call 911.
no, no. Listen.
the police are looking for me, okay?
I can explain everything.
okay, look, all I have in the house is some gauze and ointment.
you're a nurse, right?
you'll do better than I will.
Maggie, I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I swear. Look at me.
Sean, you have about a pint and a half of blood on your shirt;
you're gonna need stitches.
you may need a transfusion.
no, you're not hearing me, okay?
hospitals have to report this kind of stuff.
right now, that is not an option for me.
I'll bleed out in the street if I have to.
will you help me?
it's a whole other thing for me to go in alone with a record and all sorts of circumstantial stuff that's gonna make me look guilty as hell.
are nurses supposed to make faces like that?
you're looking at me like I'm already dead.
I'm sorry.
what do you expect?
I don't do a lot of trauma work, okay?
and you have a bullet in there.
I don't want to push it aroundnd make it worse.
Sean, do you understand why this scares me?
I'm afraid that you're gonna die.
you need to get to a hospital.
not tonight, all right?
just get me through the night.
then I'm gonna find whatever I need, and I'm gonna show the cops that it's Tally they're looking for, not me.
Sean, I don't care about any of that.
I'm not gonna die, Maggie, okay?
I can't.
I'm not done yet.
the equation for momentum
is it mass times velocity or mass times acceleration?
uh, velocity.
how long does it take for a pregnancy to show?
Hello?
okay, yeah.
fine with me.
ask the source.
Galina's on her way up.
what is she doing here?
I told her I'd meet her later.
here's what I don't get.
why are you so sure this baby's mine?
is yours.
what about Razmik, your cousin?
is cousin of my cousin, not blood relative.
and we meet one month ago.
but if you haven't gone to a doctor, how do know how far along you are?
women know.
Yeah, but we were always careful.
other times, it is nice and warm.
nothing is open, and we're out of...
okay. All right.
I say, "Be careful.
you say, "Oh, Galina...
okay, all right. Enough.
you say "I am careful.
all right.
enough. I was there.
Yeah, you were.
and now we're here.
I think I'm just gonna go downstairs.
we'll go.
no, I'd rather. Really.
just... figure this out.
there's nothing to figure out.
I'm keeping baby.
I want you to take a paternity test and if you got some problem with it...
okay, fine.
I will do.
the tax return statements for 2003, 2004... Where's 2005?
Beth, when you win the lottery,
I think it automatically prequalifies you to buy most homes.
cameron, I could be on a plane any minute.
I can't bring a baby back to a hotel room.
is this the inspection report for your new place?
Yeah.
do you want me to take a look at it?
you know, honestly,
I'm trying to get out of here, my home, or what used to be my home, as quickly as possible, before Nina drops by.
uh, Nina's not gonna drop by.
or calls.
she's not gonna call, either.
Beth, we're not together.
unbelievable.
after all that.
two marriages, a family, friendship, a partnership, destroyed...
for what?
she had her reasons.
and I have to respect them.
cameron, do you realize how many states we've filed tax returns in?
chasing tenure, I thought, but I have to wonder
were you just trying to get back here?
no, I grew up here.
this is my home.
tell me, did we come back here so you could be near her?
so you could be close to Nina?
no. It's just that wherever we were,
I always felt like,
I don't know, something was...
missing. You can say it.
Yeah, but I swear it wasn't you, Beth.
I get that now.
I just hope whatever it was, you find it soon...before someone else gets hurt.
keep the change.
Thanks.
excuse me, Miss.
you can't eat that here.
please? I'll be quick and I really don't want to go to my room right now.
I'm sorry.
it's a hotel rule.
I think we can bend the rules this time.
who is that?
his dad owns the hotel.
I don't care what size the logo on the follow-car is, just so long as it's on there when we start the race.
do you understand me?
I do not have...
I'm gonna call you back.
I'm sorry to show up like this.
and yet you did.
well, you won't return my calls.
the race is in a week.
everything I have is riding on this.
I understand that.
I just thought that you'd want to know that Cameron and I aren't together.
that we're not going to be.
I ended it.
what, is that supposed to make me feel better?
a couple of rolls in the hay with Cameron meant more to you than me. And our girls.
I can't justify what I did.
Peter, you have every right to hate me.
but there are some things that we still have to deal with.
we have to find a way to talk to the girls, tell them the truth.
what you really mean is you have to figure out a way to tell them what you did with Uncle Cameron, right?
I want to figure out a way to tell them that I'm not coming home.
I've got to get home, Sunny.
Dan Campbell finally called back about taking over as team manager.
but he wanted to talk to you.
I tried putting him through, but I guess your assistant told you it was me calling.
tell him I'll call him from the car.
look...
I know what it feels like to have the rug pulled from under you by your friends, Peter.
I really do.
the day you won the lottery,
I came home from my job here to find a basement flooded and my credit maxed out.
that's when I find out that you guys won without me.
so I went back and I counted.
I hosted more of those parties than anyone else.
every time, I not only put my dollar in, but I made sure that no one got left out.
and practically the only time that I forgot to put my dollar in, everyone wins more money then they will ever need.
and not one of you, my supposed friends, even bothered to pick up the phone.
I told you the truth because I thought you deserved to know.
I told you because I trust you, Peter.
let me give you some advice, Sunny.
if you want somebody to trust you, don't start by telling them a lie.
do me a favor.
don't mix me up with your wife because there's a difference.
that's none of your business.
even after last night?
I believed in you when no one else did, not your best friend, not your wife and I think that I at least deserve a chance to make you believe in me.
you looking for forgiveness, you might want to broaden your search.
you might want to ask yourself who you're really mad at here.
No!
no, stop.
no, no, no.
please don't give me a ticket.
Oh, my God.
of course I know you, Beth.
didn't look like you did.
Beth who puts eggshells in the pastry crust.
that was an accident, you know.
I was learning.
who hates car alarms.
who laughs in her sleep.
Beth-- who is newly separated.
nice to see you, Beth.
I... laughed in my sleep?
you were dreaming.
it was, um...
cute.
nice.
sweet.
Pascal, would you by any chance want to grab a cup of coffee?
the coast is clear if you want to go back to your room.
how'd it go?
horrible.
but she agreed to a paternity test.
she did?
that's good, I guess.
is it?
she said she was only with Razmik for the last month or so, but there could have been other guys.
when?
Damien, you said yourself, all she did for months was wait around the hotel for you to come back to the room.
I said it was possible.
so is the fact that this is your baby.
Frankie, if this test shows...
if it goes badly...
goes badly"?
Damien, it's not a math exam.
that doesn't mean I'm going to be with her.
I'm with you.
none of this feels real.
when that baby's born,
I think it will be the most real thing you've ever felt.
what happens sometimes is, um...
mommies and daddies love each other, but in different ways, and sometimes, that can change.
even though they still love each other, it makes it so they can't live in the same house for a while.
that's what me and Mommy are going to do.
where are we going to live?
you're going to live with both of us, sweetheart.
only now, you're going to take turns.
so sometimes you'll be with Daddy, and sometimes you'll be with me.
here?
when you're with me, you'll be here.
daddy's going to stay right here.
but we're not all going to be together?
no, sweetheart, we're not.
but we're still going to be a family.
and we're going to love each other and take care of each other as always.
only now, we get to have sleepovers at Mommy's house.
you have a house?
for a little while.
it's more like a cottage, you know, like in the storybooks.
do we get to have canopy beds?
shut up, Daisy!
I'm going to bed.
honey, it's only 6: 30.
will you read us a story?
Yeah, of course I will, sweetheart.
I mean you and Mommy both.
look, if you don't have it, it's fine.
I'm not sure if this is the edition you're looking for, but this is the compilation you mentioned.
Yeah, great, that's it. Thanks.
um, how long have you worked at this bookstore?
a couple of months.
I'm finishing my master's.
the hours are flexible, and when it's slow, I can do my own work.
but you're not at the university?
no. I was at nt State.
just have to write my thesis.
I'm camped out at my parents' right now.
my mom's usually at the lake house, so it works out.
my dad's dead.
why am I telling you all this?
I guess 'cause I asked you.
29-- I'm back in my old room, a half-finished thesis on my desk and a poster of Ralph Macchio on my wall.
I think those posters come down.
I just want to take a breather, see the world a little bit, you know?
so that's what you'd want?
I mean, if you could have anything.
uh, I guess.
if you're asking.
I am.
but why are you asking?
Oh, I'm just curious.
just, you know, conversation.
don't worry.
I'm not trying to hit on you or anything like that.
okay.
I'll see you.
I'm only staying until I'm sure the girls are down.
if Daisy can't sleep,
I can handle it.
I should be here, too, Peter.
this is big for them.
and then I'll go home.
I promise.
home to your storybook cottage?
I know you haven't bought it.
you're renting already?
it belongs to Cameron.
he bought it last week.
I wasn't even supposed to be living there.
what were you supposed to be doing there?
he bought this place so you guys would have a place to meet?
no.
then what?
you were going to live there together.
that's thinking ahead.
car crash interrupted more of a long-term strategy.
Peter, he's not even there.
and I don't have anywhere else to go.
because you can't afford a hotel?
because we're broke?
because I spent all the money on the bike business?
you okay, sweetie?
violet left.
Where'd she go?
I think she ran away.
she told me not to tell you.
call the cops.
I'm going to look for her.
honey, what else did she say to you?
Oh, my God.
Where'd you get all that stuff?
I had to steal it from a clinic that I'm volunteering at.
a free clinic.
I'll make them a generous donation.
it's already been taken care of, thank you.
all right.
let's see it.
okay.
what?
all right, well, the bleeding slowed down, so that's good.
what's all that stuff?
Oh, I've just been...
I've been going over the past couple months, you know, trying to figure out if there's any tracks Tally might have left.
so much for that sleep I asked you to get, huh?
I'll sleep when I'm dead, okay?
which is soon if I don't get any help, I know.
I'm not going to make any moves till I at least get some insurance in my pocket.
insurance?
what kind of insurance?
evidence for the cops.
what do you think you're doing?
you can't go anywhere.
the night Zoe died,
tally stuck the money in a duffel bag into a hotel spa locker.
now, a lot of those places have cameras, right?
I figure if I can get a copy of the tape...
Sean, you're not gonna even make it halfway there before you reopen that wound, okay?
you lost a ton of blood.
you have none left to spare.
who's going to get the tape, then?
what's the name of the hotel?
can't believe I'm doing this.
nice move.
I'm sorry.
it's okay. Don't be.
it's the most excitement I've had all day.
so fourth floor, right?
uh, yeah. How'd you know?
I've seen you around.
besides, it's...
I heard.
it's your hotel, right?
in the will.
tragically, Mom and Dad are thriving.
so how long are you staying?
well, um, I'm kind of living here.
that sounds weird, huh?
my sister and I grew up in hotels; that's weird.
Seriously?
your whole life?
four-star freak show.
but we triumphed over adversities like room service, minibars, spas...
so you living here with your parents?
no.
just me.
I think this is your floor.
Oh. Right. Yeah.
listen, my sister and I are going to a party tonight.
you should come.
I have a boyfriend.
and I have a limo. A big one. Bring him with.
he can't make it, actually.
he's kind of...busy... um...with his wife.
you gotta be kidding me.
that sounds... interesting.
car's out front in an hour.
see you then...
neighbor?
this place has the best French food, and you've never eaten here?
no.
I guess you had enough growing up.
you said you lived in Paris.
well, the thing is,
I worked there, but I'm from a small town.
listen, Beth, about the night we met...
you know, I'm sorry.
no, don't be, because...
I... wasn't ready to date or get involved.
I guess it was probably hard to tell that, given the fact that I jumped you.
no, Beth, it's...
I should have said something.
and I really wanted to be past it, so I guess...
I just pretended I was.
the French must have a word for it. They must.
I believe what it's called is "lying.
what?
it's called lying.
is that a Scottish saying?
no, Beth, I lied to you.
I speak French, I've studied in France, but I'm really from Scotland.
I put the accent on as a dare-- a bet, really-- to prove a point.
that you're a crazy person?
no.
all the good chef positions go to French guys.
people think that they're born knowing how to cook and all the Scots can do is make scones that taste like bricks.
is your name even Pascal?
no, it's Patrick.
I wanted to tell you...
before or after you slept with me?
from the second we started talking, but I liked you, and I thought if you knew...
I wouldn't want anything to do with you.
Oh, that's the date right there.
Yeah, that's, uh...
got to be the one.
my friend's going to love this.
and why do you need it again?
well, it's my friend's birthday, and, uh, me and my girlfriends, we're gonna show it at her party.
a security amera video of her going into a locker room?
Yeah, um... it's a...
it's a joke, you know, 'cause, uh, my friend, she's like this exercise addict.
how is that funny?
if you knew her, I promise you, you would find it hilarious.
I'm not supposed to give out these tapes.
I know, and I was hoping that you would just make an exception for this super-special case.
I could bring it home, make a copy and bring it right back.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just don't think I can.
OK, uh, listen.
uh, right here in my bag,
I have my niece's confirmation gift.
it's a thousand dollars.
okay, so I'll give you a thousand bucks right now for that tape.
this is a little sick, you know that?
Yeah. You want the money or not?
well, if she does show up there, you can call on my cell or at home, okay?
all right.
Yes, I mean, the police are looking, too. -I'm sorry. Let me take this.
Keith? Yeah. Hi, listen. Peter Schaeffer.
about an hour and a half ago.
...a little bit of a problem here.
it's Violet.
she, uh... ran away.
h-hold on.
I've got another call.
Hello?
Oh. Sunny.
Yes, but this is really a bad time.
it's Sunny.
tell her not now.
she says it's an emergency.
sunny, I really can't... -Colin's times were way off in the trials.
the board's called an emergency session for first thing tomorrow morning.
I just thought you should know.
I can't deal with this right now.
if Colin loses this race,
Peter, they're talking about pulling the plug.
okay, not just dumping you, but carving up the entire company, firing everyone.
sunny, I can't handle it, okay?
I'm having a real emergency here.
violet ran away...
sunny, I've got to clear the line, okay?
the police are gonna be trying to call.
damn it.
Hello?
yes...
is she all right?
where?
I'll be right there.
thank you.
is she okay?
she's fine.
she's six blocks from here.
she's okay.
Hey. You don't have to knock on the door.
it's still your home.
are you back with Nina?
what? No.
be honest, Cameron.
did you buy Nina another house, some Italian villa, or a huge engagement ring?
no, what are you talking about?
almost $300, 000 that was taken out of our account today.
Beth, will you please come in?
I keep going over it in my mind, trying to figure out what you told me were lies, and what were truths.
and more and more things just...
don't go in either pile, leaving me more unsure of everything.
I-I...
I'm so sorry.
me, too, 'cause...
I met this guy.
a nice guy.
cute, fun.
but he lied to me.
not a big lie, just...
you know, a little lie.
he told me he was French when he's actually Scottish, and he lied about his name.
are you serious?
well, the culinary community does have a cultural bias in favor of the French.
just go with me for a minute.
right, right, right.
the point is, you know,
I married someone untrustworthy, and because I did,
I now find that I don't trust anyone, including my own judgment.
Beth, that's harsh.
you don't deserve that.
I do, but you don't.
you married a man who loved you.
and-and I wanted to be happy.
I did, I just didn't know how to stop wanting something I didn't have.
you mean Nina.
no, not Nina.
I want to show you something.
I think it'll answer at least some of your questions.
violet, sweetheart!
honey!
Oh, God!
I'm so happy to see you.
you scared us.
baby, never, never, ever do that again, do you understand me?
don't you ever leave without telling one of us.
your mom's right.
we know you're upset, but you cannot leave the house like that, okay?
very smart of you to have that police lady give us a call, though.
I guess that means you want to come home now.
no, I don't.
I want to stay here.
what, honey?
remember when Daddy put one of those in our backyard?
we were so happy.
can't we be like that again?
Oh, honey...
are you gonna make a divorce?
because if you do I think I might die from it.
please.
I went out with friends, and when I came back, I was kicked out.
my credit card's shut off, and Mom left, like, 50 messages for me to call her back immediately.
call her. I mean...
tell her it was just a couple nights.
she got the bill, Damien.
she knows I'm not at your house and I'm not with Dad.
can't you call your dad?
I mean, maybe you can stay with him a few nights.
and say what, exactly?
I know you took cash"instead of fighting for custody of me, but did you save any?
because I really need some.
Frankie, come on. I mean, what else are you gonna do?
you can't go back to New York.
just call him.
get s side of the story.
no.
no, I'm tired of being asked to see everyone else's side of the story.
mom's side, Dad's side...
my side?
look, I know you gave up a lot to be with me, but so did I.
tell me honestly, do you think it's your kid?
I don't know.
maybe.
I'm tired.
I'm gonna call a friend, see if I can crash somewhere.
good night.
heard you need a friend and a place to crash.
is that all you heard?
I can't help you with the, uh, boyfriend complication.
but I've got some sway when it comes to digs.
we're gonna comp Ms. McMahon's room as long as she'd like...
I can't let you do that.
sure, you can.
come on.
kitchen's closed, but I make a mean scramble.
come on.
okay.
thank you.
okay, so we're looking for Tally and the money, right?
watch close. -Okay.
now, that's her going in.
she's got the bag.
right?
now, watch.
there, right there.
you see that, right there?
that's her coming out...
with no bag.
who sticks a bag in a hotel spa locker and leaves it overnight?
how can you even prove that there's money in the bag?
I can't.
but it matches a bag that she left at the police prenct.
okay?
trust me.
there's this, uh, this detective I've been talking to...
this is gonna make her look guilty.
all right, you know, maybe it'll... Oh, the cops might actually do some police work for once.
Sean, what's wrong?
it's nothing. I'm fine.
what, are you having trouble breathing?
Sean, why didn't you tell me?
you're burning up.
okay, just don't try to get up, please. Oh, my God.
Yeah, yes. I need an ambulance at 19 Larch Row right away, please.
you'll check on her, right?
and turn on the alarm so if she opens a door...
I don't think she's going to run away again.
anyway, I should go.
just stay.
they'll...
they'll want to see you when they wake up in the morning.
I can sleep on the couch.
Peter, I'm so sorry.
I know.
and I do love you.
I know you probably think I have no right to say it, but it's true.
and I love this family...
so much.
me, too.
then don't we owe it to them?
and to us, too?
to see if maybe we can...
try to fix this?
my sister lives there.
what sister?
cameron, you have three brothers.
one lives in Minneapolis...
my half-sister.
my father had two families.
it turns out we were the second.
he was married before your mother?
my father never married my mother.
I found that out when I was 11, and before that,
I used to think he just traveled a lot.
and he traveled
he traveled all the way over here, about 20 minutes away, to his wife and children.
his real children.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
but she talks about her husband.
she's lying.
I guess she did it to save face and to protect us kids.
and it worked until I found this letter that she had written him, begging him to leave his wife.
I don't think they ever knew.
so how did you know where they lived?
the letter was in an envelope.
she never mailed it.
Beth, you say...
whatever it is that I don't have you hope I find.
I-I don't know if I can because I think it's gone.
he's dead.
can... can you just wait here one second?
there's something I want to do.
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Hey.
uh, Cameron.
remember me?
Yeah. From the bookstore.
um, what are you doing here?
please, don't be freaked out.
I know this is crazy, but, um, I-I'm not crazy.
I swear.
that's probably what crazy people say all the time, isn't it?
um, look,
I-I just came here because I wanted to give you this.
this is a... ticket.
for a cruise ship.
Yeah, it's, um...
really a lease on a cabin.
it's like an at-sea condo.
if you're gonna see the whole world, you need at least a year;
you're gonna want to stretch out, right?
finish your thesis.
a cruise?
around the whole world?!
Oh, you got to be kidding me!
who are you?
so that's where the money went.
a trip around the world.
did you tell her?
that she's my half-sister?
no, I didn't want to tear apart her idea of, you know, who her father was.
well... our father was.
it's amazing, isn't it?
giving her something that she could never have had when she grew up with everything you didn't.
who'd have thought that'd be a fix?
it's a start anyway.
Violet's okay?
Yeah, thank God.
look, the board's convening in 15 minutes.
but before you go in there,
I want you to see this.
what is it?
receipts.
for the donations I made to three charities yesterday.
I was going to give a million back to everyone who gave it to me, but then I thought, they're already multi-millionaires, and look how well that turned out.
you know, that's...
it's everything
except what I have in this company.
all I have left now is what I have with you.
sorry to keep you waiting. Ms. Kokorev,
I'm Sarah.
I'm the genetic counselor.
we spoke on the phone.
and this is?
the father.
great.
so, I understand you're of Irish and German descent?
Yeah.
well, that's good.
see, it exponentially decreases your chances of an extreme form of the defect.
defect?
um, what defect?
um... it's most important reason why I'm taking test.
greek side of my family, one uncle, and two cousins they have, um...
sick baby.
is not gd.
sick? What-what kind of sick?
they had, um...
how I pronounce?
it's a blood disease.
now, your baby will inevitably inherit the gene.
but the chorionic vill sampling we're doing will indice how severe-- or not-- the abnormality might be.
are you okay?
should I go on?
please.
let me be clear:
it's very smart that you're taking this test, but there's a really good chance that your baby is just a single-gene carrier...
which would put your pregnancy back into the "normal" category.
how about other test?
for "papa-ternity.
she means "paternity.
Oh, right.
I'm sorry, I didn't see that on the chart.
well, if you just go down the hall, someone will take your blood work.
you ready?
Yeah.
I-I can do the blood work later, right?
because I'd like to come, too, if that's all right.
Yeah.
there.
that's the baby's heart.
Oh, my God, is that a fist...
moving?
Oh, yeah.
would you like to hear the heartbeat?
Yes.
would you like to sit down?
so fresh air maybe?
Yeah.
Mr. Falsone?
can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah, I can hear you.
you're just coming out of general anesthesia.
you underwent emergency surgery to treat a bullet wound.
is Maggie here?
Where's Maggie?
ms. Hernandez is right outside.
so how long before he can get up and walk around?
Oh, a day or two.
soon.
and you talked to Maggie?
didn't she show you the tape?
what tape?
Sean, you need rest.
talk to him.
please, just... listen to me.
okay?
why...
would I kill her if I already had my money?
why would I still be here?
why am I still here and it's Tally that ran?
your girlfriend didn't run.
she told us everything.
she...
she told you that I killed Zoe?
tally told us that you threatened her to keep her quiet.
no.
but she knows she's safe now, and she can tell the truth.
she did it, okay?
I swear, I can...
I'd be happy to listen to everything you have to say, Sean, after you've heard your rights.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have a right to an attorney.
you have a right to have that attorney present during questioning...
I respect your power. I respect your weakness. Hear my prayers.
God of the lame...
what the hell's all this?
sorry, sir. I didn't see you coming.
no. Why would you? You're only doing security, after all.
Oh, Christ...
you're praying.
pack up your juju dolls and piss off.
you're fired.
like it Danny?
my biggest project to date.
you know what I love about it?
no tenants.
tenants are...scum.
always bleating on about their rights, never a word about their responsibilities.
Oh, no.
no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, Danny...
why didn't you come to me?
I'm a reasonable man.
we could have sorted things out.
now, you've forced my hand.
winning the patient's trust is vital.
they have to believe in the treatment and the therapist if they're going to make any progress.
it's the er...the placebo effect, if you like.
placebo effect?
sorry, Noel? Yes?
the placebo effect? I mean, come on, it's like homoeopathy.
it only works in cases where the patient was getting better anyway.
so you don't believe suggestion can have any physical effect?
if you're extremely gullible, maybe.
let's try it.
see if I can plant a suggestion in your head.
round of applause for Noel. Come on.
right. Sit down, Noel.
give me your hand.
how would you feel if I succeeded?
controlled your reactions through suggestion?
you couldn't stand up to me, could you?
you couldn't rise to the challenge.
Yeah. I mean...
what?
now...
try raising your left arm.
well, it looks like you were right, Noel. Go and sit down.
go on, sit down.
I can't stand up.
what did you do? - How suggestible you are has nothing to do with intelligence or gullibility.
you can stand up, Noel.
if you want to.
now, go and sit down.
were you really unable to stand up, or did you just think you couldn't?
we're studying psychology. Try not to underestimate the power of your own mind.
across behind...
that's it. Over.
up through that hole under your chin. - I'm falling behind.
there. That's it. Now you put it down through that gap. Underneath...
you got it. That's...
right, we'll do it later. Go and get your shoes on.
now is not a good time.
Yeah. He's getting ready for school.
he's fine.
he's happy and he's settled. Why do you want to see him now?
well, he's been your son since he was born, Gabriel.
yeah? Well, you do that.
who was that?
tie up your laces. You're going to trip up.
where?
thanks for coming down.
it's a young girl, about 13, 14, washed up this morning.
water will make it difficult to get forensics, so anything you can give us...
I'd say she's been in the water about 20 hours.
strangled, and her throat was cut.
both? Hardly a drop of blood left.
I can't tell yet if she was raped.
not a drop of blood.
she's well-off. Middle-class family, but she's ashamed of it, and they're ashamed of her.
all the piercings and the tattoos are only where they can be seen.
it's, I wanted to shock. I wanted to be noticed.
I wanted someone to listen, but they won't listen, and they don't care.
you know, they split up, my mum and dad.
it got a bit messy, and I got in the way.
sexually motivated? - Because she's half naked? Not necessarily.
any signs of a struggle? Defensive wounds?
not so far. Cuts, bruises, rope marks... Nothing.
can you turn her over?
chief, we have a possible ID.
Jenny Stark, 14, missing since Monday.
her school reported her for truancy. - Her school?
checked with the parents. They said she'd walked out. - And they let her?
can you come?
Alex, I ought to be...
Yeah, OK. Why not?
wait... Wait...
Yes, it's...
Jenny... - Don't.
I'm an accountant, at Green Belt Holdings.
and Denise is Jenny's stepmother? - Yes.
it's just the photos. They're quite recent.
my wife and I divorced two years ago.
she didn't want custody of Jenny.
did you?
of course! It just got...
she resented me from the day we met.
first, it was just sulking, answering back, then she started drinking and sleeping around, the tattoos...
when did it start, this extreme behaviour?
about two months ago. - When you told her you were pregnant?
you told them? - No. Sorry. It's just the way you...
she got pretty violent. She smashed things up. She swore - Did you retaliate? - How do you mean, retaliate?
look, this has got nothing to do with us.
nothing to do with you? - Why not talk to those weirdos she hung out with?
let's get this straight... - Alex?
you couldn't cope, so you washed your hands, didn't tell us, social services, her mother.
we heard from the school. - What would you have done?
thanks for your help. We should get back.
we'll talk again.
you don't terminate my interviews.
you know when you accuse me of being insensitive...
his daughter's on a slab and they think she did it to spite them!
you weren't questioning them. You were picking a fight! What's going on, Alex.
talk to the neighbours, check for reports of domestics.
I want to know what they've been doing the past three days, both of them.
Tony, I need your input. - Yeah, but you don't want it.
please?
send me the files.
so, the knife blade's crude, possibly home-made.
red paint under fingernails.
the tattoo... What is that? Is that Satanic?
hymen intact.
you were a virgin.
you weren't screwing around, despite what your stepmother said.
the name of Jesus... Is that to mock him or to honour him?
death from blood loss?
no sign of ligatures or restraints.
so, you...you volunteered for this?
you submitted to this?
I mean, you were angry, but you weren't suicidal.
Ben, I told you to clear up those toys before I break my neck.
Karen, hi. It's Alex Fielding from No. 31.
I know it's short notice, but I was wondering if you could do me a favour and baby-sit Ben?
tonight. Uh-huh.
sorry, your phone's been... - Oh, no worries. Thanks all the same.
there's something ritualistic about... Baby-sitter's gone AWOL.
I've got a BCC meeting in 15 minutes.
what happened to the nanny? Me? - Are you busy tonight?
you need a bigger bowl.
you can buy this stuff in bags. - Yeah, but that's no fun.
you go first. You go. Ooh! My turn.
got it. So, what happened to the nanny?
it was my fault. - What did you do?
I called her mummy by accident.
mum and her had a row and she left.
well, that doesn't sound like your fault.
do you have any kids?
no. You need a girlfriend for that, and I tend to freak them out.
mum's always home late. She's always angry and she's always tired.
have you ever tried maple syrup on this?
Mmm?
maple syrup?
Oi! So, you ladies still here?
where are we supposed to go? - What happened to Danny?
I thought he did all the talking. - He disappeared.
so much for leadership, huh?
OK, you lot have to go.
you can't stay here. It's just not safe.
I mean, have you seen this, this big damp patch?
have a closer look.
if I was you, I'd leave while I could still walk.
Tony... It's late. You need to go home
Hey, Alex.
I thought we were going to... OK. - Can we do it in the morning?
can you help me with him? - Yeah. Mm-hm.
thank you.
you've got popcorn in your hair. - Yes, I know.
bernard found abrasions on her back, suggesting contact with concrete or stone.
she lay down willingly. There's no sign of force or restraints.
she knew her killer, trusted him or her. - The parents' story checks out so far.
then try extended family or friends. Kevin, anything on the paint under her nails?
it's an American brand called Paratex, available by special order.
it's artist's paint. Pyral crimson.
it's painting as therapy, and a lot of my patients use a lot of red.
makers are faxing a list of their UK customers.
I never thanked you for last night.
Oh, you can baby-sit for me sometime.
you'd have to bring a baby, of course. - I could bring Ben.
he seems to have had fun.
Yeah, we did have a good time. We made popcorn with maple syrup.
Yeah, I know. It's still stuck to my kitchen ceiling.
you know, maybe you and Ben should... - Guv, that fax from the US.
there's three customers for that paint in Bradfield, two art schools, plus this guy.
Louis Blake. You check out the other two.
busy? - I don't know that much about art.
I don't even know what I like. - You'll know it when you see it.
Louis Blake? You got a minute?
we're making enquiries about this girl, wondered if you'd seen her around your premises.
I don't think so.
what happened to your hand? - I cut myself shaving.
Er...hello?
they're pretty bleak, aren't they? - Look, this isn't the gallery.
Ah, you work quickly.
there's not many layers. You're decisive, spontaneous.
he's passionate.
angry.
who er... Who's the girl?
she's my muse.
my inspiration. - Do you use life models?
forget it, love. I prefer them younger. - How much younger?
her age?
look, whoever she was, I'm singing, OK? - "Was"? Why do you say was?
Oi! Oi! What are you doing?
you need to mix your paint thicker.
Louis Blake, I'm arresting you in connection with the murder of Jenny Stark.
thank you.
she posed for me a few times, yeah.
she was cute.
eager to please, you know.
a girl of 14? You think that's appropriate?
who wants appropriate?
did you have sex with her?
any form of sex?
now, that would have been inappropriate.
no.
when did you see her last?
wednesday. I gave her cash for a taxi, and then she left.
does he work in oils or acrylic?
do you work in oils or acrylic?
mixed media. - Mixed with what?
bodily fluids. - Blood?
I find it adds a certain potency.
just your own blood?
you know, we're going to go over your studio and your home with an electron microscope.
if we find one speck of her blood, two days from now, you'll be painting the prison canteen.
two days from now, I'll be out walking the street, and there won't be a damn thing you can do about it.
why would she have trusted him, a creep like that?
well, he painted her.
he probably told her she was beautiful, and he was the only one who ever did.
she's awake now.
it's Paula. - Hop in.
Hey, Paula. - Chief, we've got another one.
it's just this way. - Did you call Tony Hill?
he's already here. - OK.
Oh, my God!
about nine years old. Heart's missing.
what happened to his eyes?
cut out. Same carvings on his belly.
is it with the same knife?
early days, but yes, I'd say.
so it's mutilation now.
some killers keep body parts as trophies, souvenirs.
fetish objects. - This is a child, Tony!
I know, Alex.
Yeah, Kevin? - We've got a possible ID on the new victim.
Jonas Nkomo, reported missing two days ago.
we were at the playground.
I went to buy him an ice cream, and when I went back, he...
he was a good boy.
he would not have gone off with anyone.
I thought we would be safe here in England.
when did your family come over?
six months ago.
there was fighting back home.
I was afraid for them, the children and my wife.
Where's your wife now?
she went back home.
me and Jonas managed OK.
I didn't think these things happened here.
what things?
muti.
Muti? You mean witchcraft?
they kill children, take their flesh.
the evil has followed us here.
we are still cursed.
he...
he promised us our luck would change!
who's he?
dr Kingston.
a doctor told you your luck would change?
he is a healer.
I paid him and he said he would pray for us.
his prayers were not enough.
you OK? - Don't.
if this is witchcraft, why carve the name Jesus?
Ah, but not all witchcraft is anti-Christian.
some forms, like er...
like voodoo, for instance, that's an amalgam of religions and cultures, pagan, pantheist, Christian.
I mean, whichever god's listening.
so, are we looking for an African or some sicko local who believes in the occult?
Yes. Yes.
I mean both.
see, magical thinking, it's about er...
it's about symbolism, believing there's a mystical connection between the symbol and the thing it represents.
now, Jenny didn't bleed to death, she was bled to death, so they took her blood.
then why the strangulation? - I don't know.
if this is witchcraft, these body parts aren't for trophies.
they're ingredients for spells, Jenny's blood, Jonas' eyes.
the killer wanted to see something?
or to become invisible, to move among us unseen.
so they could do this again?
I think we should talk to this healer.
Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!
Hallelu!
say amen! Amen!
Hallelu! Hallelujah!
praise the lord! Praise the lord!
we believe!
when we are washed in the blood of the lamb, Jesus will heal you.
say Jesus. Say amen! - Jesus! Amen!
Amen! Amen!
Yeah, because he, he is the son of God, in whose name we cast out demons!
Hallellu! Hallelujah! Hallellu! Hallelujah! Hallellu! Hallelujah!
say amen! Say amen! - Amen! Amen!
we have no health, no power, no life without Jesus Christ.
say Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
do you believe? - We believe.
do you truly believe? - We believe!
then only say the word! Lord!
and you shall be healed.
healed! Healed!
look at the work of Jesus!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
sorry, can I help? - DI Fielding, Bradfield CID.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Kingston.
he doesn't usually see people without an appointment.
that's all right, Wendy. It's OK.
I'm sorry. She's new.
it's hard work, preaching the word.
how can I help you? - You had contact recently with Rory Nkomo and his son, Jonas.
Oh, yes! Nkomo! Lovely people. We have prayed together many times.
you offered to lift a curse from them. - Mm-hm.
Why? What has happened?
Jonas has been murdered.
we believe that voodoo is involved. Parts of his body were cut out.
wicked... Wicked...
God forgive them.
little Jonas? That is terrible.
would you say that you knew the parents well?
well, they were members of my congregation, not personal friends.
do you know anyone that could have done this?
demons, they walk amongst us in human form every day.
those who have eyes, they let them see.
sir, what do you mean by that?
it's a figure of speech.
are you actually a doctor? - I'm a healer.
through me, the lord works miracles.
in exchange for donations.
Mmm... Well, premises, they cost money.
do they work, these miracles? - You saw what happened here tonight.
I saw a woman who believed she was cured, yes. - Mm-hm.
but these cures might be down to suggestion, and suggestion, it wears off.
miracles do not wear off.
if you have no faith, they will not work for you. That's your loss.
I'm sorry. I know nothing about Jonas' death.
I really hope you catch the savages who did it.
Thanks. Been fascinating.
lovely murals, by the way. - Thank you.
may I? - Oh, yes, take one.
thank you.
he should come and see me.
Mr. Nkomo.
I could help him.
with God's blessing, he can have more sons.
do you think you can simply replace a child?
do you have children?
no, I don't. - Then how would you know?
wasting our bloody time here.
then go home. Ben would like to see you.
I don't need you to tell me what to do with my son.
what I need from you is a profile of a killer.
I'll see what I can do.
wash in the blood of the lamb. Eat the flesh of the Son.
figures of speech?
if spells are figures of speech and prayers are just words that make wishes come true...
curses and prayers.
rituals mask the signature, but the motives are the same.
surrender, submission, power.
these children, they were motherless.
they were eager to trust someone...
and you betrayed that trust.
and when innocence dies, there's no going back, is there?
the choice of victims suggests predatory male, late 30s...
with African connections, like Nkomo.
what, you think he'd sacrifice his own son?
parents attack their children every day, Tony. You know that.
about last night... - Er... Alex...
forensics went over his studio and his squat. The only blood they found was his own.
anyway, he was in custody when Jonas was killed.
he fits the profile.
I know, but it's not enough.
get off me! Just get off me!
that's mine. So call the police.
you don't want to mess with me. It's bad luck.
Christ! You nearly blinded me, you prick!
Oh, stop making such a bloody fuss.
you, gather your crap, and leave.
Tony! Switching to anthropology?
I recognise this one. - The white horse at Uffington.
three thousand years old.
I need your advice. No. - This is one of your murders, isn't it?
well, yes.
Esther, is there a tribe anywhere that commits ritual murder, where firstly, the victim is strangled and then they have their throat cut?
not now. There was, of course, this lot. The Celts.
Lindow Man, smacked on the head, strangled, throat slashed, dumped in a bog.
very economical.
economical? - Three gods, one victim.
the blow to the head for Tanarus, god of thunder, the strangling and slashing for Esus, god of the underworld, and then dumped in a bog to honour Teutates, the river god.
what was the second one you said? - Esus.
here we are.
can I borrow these?
a rope and a knife. It's the same ritual.
you're not just doing this for Jesus Christ. You're sacrificing to Esus as well.
God of the dead.
CID. DS Geoffries
could you repeat that please?
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name
Yeah, right.
guv! Just got a call about Jonas Nkomo.
Oh, my God... You're going to wear me out.
what's the magic word?
you wicked little bitch.
yeah?
you what?
what the hell do they want?
once you've finished here, start over there.
they've just started laying concrete. - Well, they can stop.
you! What the hell's going on here? - And you are?
Peter Vancliff and this is my development.
every minute these men stand around costs me a fortune!
we've received information relating to an ongoing murder inquiry.
what the hell does that mean? - We've had a tip-off there might be body parts buried here.
a tip-off? You kidding me?! - You'll get your site back when we're finished.
someone is taking the piss, someone who wants to screw me and my business.
nobody screws me, not you not anybody. You understand?
I'm sorry. Couldn't find any wellies. - Mr. Hill, this is Mr. Vancliff.
pleased to meet you, Mr... - Ah, piss off!
guv... You need to take a look at this. - Yes?
stay here, please. - This is my bloody site!
you'll stay here or I'll have you arrested!
you don't want to screw with me either, believe me.
Oh, God Almighty... Is that... A human heart? Yes, it is.
it's Jonas.
this caller, was it male, female? - Er...male.
Yeah, I think it sounded male.
any idea of an age?
did he have an accent?
what did he say exactly?
you took notes, didn't you?
Er...something about... - Oh, for God's sake!
he could have been the one who left this here!
I want the site entrance closed until the SOCOs have gone over the area thoroughly.
find out who was on security the past 48 hours, and start interviewing them.
get on top of it, Kevin.
the early Egyptians and the Aztecs, the Celts, they used to sacrifice humans, and buried them in the foundations of buildings.
so, do you want me to round up all the Aztecs?
maybe this wasn't intended to curse the site.
maybe it was put here to bless it.
sorry, love. We need to keep this area clear.
can you not see what's going on here? This is sabotage!
you got any rivals or enemies capable of this?
all of them. This is going to cost me 100 grand easy.
a little boy was murdered to sabotage your site?
it'll cost his father a damn sight more than money.
what? The guy's a prick. - Mm-hm. Which guy's that?
is that Vancliff or Ben's father?
has he been in touch, hassling you about Ben?
no, I'm not psychic, Alex. Ben told me someone rang, and...
you know the way you've been acting: distracted, defensive, aggressive.
my personal life is none of your business.
you're not seeing enough of your son so you're feeling guilty and insecure.
then you fire your childminder and can't bring yourself to replace her, but that's only making things worse.
I don't have time... - Alex, you're good at delegating, so do it now.
go home. Stop having nightmares.
none of the workmen saw anyone in that area.
security reported no intruders. - This person is not invisible.
whoever buried that heart knew the layout.
they probably had authorised access.
sorry. Joseph Stark.
what, Jenny's father? - He works for Vancliff.
go and see what he has to say.
anything on Vancliff? - Plenty.
hand-on property developer.
allegations of harassment and intimidation.
nothing's ever stuck. Expensive lawyers. Get him in.
you've got quite a reputation as a certain sort of businessman.
a successful one, yeah.
I was thinking one who uses physical methods of persuasion.
I'm a physical kind of guy.
you've been interviewed for assaults on your tenants.
you got an actual question?
he's trying to dictate the pace. Take your time, Alex.
one of your tenants, Danny Miller, he disappeared a few days ago.
last seen getting into your car.
can't I even give a friend a lift to the station?
is that where he ended up?
Oh, you think maybe I killed him, cut him up into pieces, bagged him, buried him hosed the site down and chucked the weapon into the river maybe?
that's not conjecture. That's boasting.
suppose I did that. Just... Just suppose.
do you think I'd be dumb enough to bury the bits in my own site?
can you tell me how a child's heart came to be there?
I think someone killed him, broke into my site, buried the heart and phoned you anonymously.
Why? What do you think happened?
ask him about Africa.
I understand you've done business in Africa.
I have connections there. Are you planning a holiday?
was Muti ever used against him?
in your dealings over there, have you ever come across witchcraft?
once or twice: a hand buried in a doorway brings in business, and a man's tongue can talk you into a woman's knickers.
do you believe in it?
I'm all for cultural diversity.
people can believe what they want.
did any of your business rivals use it?
your clients or your employees?
not till now.
doesn't it frighten you? - It's like psychological warfare.
a splash of blood works wonders.
terrify the enemy, make them think you're capable of anything, you've won the battle before you've even started.
isn't that the way you do business?
it's all part of the fun, the adrenaline rush, fight or flight, kill or be killed.
couldn't do without it. - Do you enjoy frightening people?
do you enjoy inflicting pain?
don't you?
you dress it up, call it police work, but admit it, you love it when you get a suspect crumbling.
you get off on it, humiliating them, crushing them.
you haven't tasted victory till you've made a grown man weep for his mummy.
business isn't about winning.
it's about tearing the other guy apart.
literally? - You can't let this guy go, Alex. He's a classic psychopath.
do you know what the really funny bit is?
the kid's dad, Nkomo... - What about him?
worked for me till last week.
one o'clock in the morning, I walk in and found him worshipping at a voodoo altar, offering bits of raw meat up to some god, with a machete in his hand, and you drag me in here?
he has the motive, he has access to the site, access to the victim.
I should be a copper. Any eejit can do it.
what was he doing there?
what were you doing there at one o'clock in the morning?
minding my business.
thanks for your time, Mr. Vancliff.
we'll talk again.
Yes, Green Belt Holdings is Peter Vancliff's firm, but I just do the books.
I'm office-based.
so you have never been to the riverside site?
I have been to the occasional meeting there, but...
can I get you a drink or something?
have you ever found anything odd in the accounts? I can't discuss that with you.
I have a duty of confidence to...
let me get you that drink.
my altar.
it is our tradition to worship this way.
we offer the gods food, sometimes meat.
who is this? - Auroon, god of metalworkers.
I was a metalworker. - You make knives, blades, that kind of thing?
not here. Not now.
excuse me.
the god of metalworkers? - And the god of war.
it's just... I don't see any offerings.
my son is dead. There is nothing any god can do for me.
I don't think he's involved. - It's Paula. She's collapsed.
it seems to be a serious attack of asthma, probably triggered by an allergen.
has she been exposed to any toxins or chemicals?
shit! Better warn the team working on that site.
has she suffered from asthma before?
late-onset asthma is surprisingly common, I'm afraid.
why can't you just book a holiday like everyone else?
these weren't random children. Both their fathers work for Vancliff.
Yeah, and Vancliff rules by intimidation and brutality.
believes he's invincible because no-one will testify against him.
but they might phone in an anonymous tip-off. - Yes.
I think we should talk to Stark again, offer him protection.
you going there now? - No. I'm going home.
someone told me I should delegate more, so I'm interviewing a nanny.
Oh. You want me to come? - No.
so, why did you leave your last job? - Well, they had to move abroad.
they did ask me to come, but my dad's getting on a bit.
well, they do speak very highly of you.
Oh, Ben!
is that me? It's lovely!
Oh, I wish I was that beautiful.
do you want to show it to your mum?
typical! I spend millions on plant. One call and the cops would have dug the foundations for nothing.
you think this is funny, somebody using my site as a tip?
nobody got in or out, guv. Security's positive. - Security
they got the Nigerian arsehole.
they're all in this together.
guv?
that witch doctor thinks he can psych me out.
I'll baptise him in his own blood.
Christ!
I know who sent this.
he wants to play funny buggers?
fetch the Merc.
watch! - Guv?
he can't!
he's dead and buried!
Why's he here?
boss, just take it easy.
massive coronary. But we found this.
SOCO say it's Plasticine, mixed with blood.
it's not what it's made of. It's the thought that counts.
he opens it, and he just goes mental.
starts seeing things. - Yeah? What sort of things?
he said someone was coming after him, someone dead and buried.
was he using any drugs? - He was fine until he saw that thing.
he talked about a witch doctor trying to scare him.
witch doctor? - Said he'd baptise him in his own blood.
wash him in the blood of the lamb.
your boss, did he have any dealings with a man called Kingston?
the preacher? Yeah. He's one of our tenants.
I wish I could help you. - Vancliff was your landlord.
God have mercy upon him. Not a very good man.
who did your paintings? - A local artist.
what kind of rent did he charge? Vancliff. - Extortionate.
that is our play area, for the children.
Extortionate? - Pardon?
you used the word extortionate. Did Vancliff try an extort money from you?
well, he tried to raise the rent. My congregation cannot afford it.
your congregation or your clients? - I don't know what you mean.
Rory Nkomo paid you to lift a curse.
it must have taken a special kind of prayer.
is this your...
that area is private!
Where's your bathroom? - There is no bathroom.
Oh, you don't live here?
why the big fridge?
do you want to tell us how you came to have a fridge full of blood and animal organs?
they are for ceremonial use.
so your ceremonies involve mutilating animals?
the Bible tells us sacrifices pleases the lord: the fatted calf, lamb...
firstborn son.
where in the Bible does it tell us to sacrifice dogs and snakes?
it is a tradition in many parts of Africa.
Oh, so you practise a mixture of African and Christian traditions?
we do the lord's work.
we cure the sick.
so, if you've got the power to cure, you've also got the power to curse.
I do not curse anybody.
we found this under a floorboard.
Jenny Stark was killed with a rough blade.
her blood was drained from her body.
Jonas Nkomo had his heart and his eyes cut out.
not with that knife. - Who else had access to it?
the blood that I keep is the blood of animals.
the lord gave us dominion over them.
Yeah, and did the lord tell him to defy the law?
even if you were just sacrificing animals, you're breaking a dozen laws, import controls, quarantine, animal welfare.
God keeps watch over his servants.
and did God raise you above the law?
I am blessed.
the Nkomos came to you for help, but you had your own problems.
Vancliff was threatening you, demanding half your profits, so you retaliated with witchcraft.
not witchcraft, ancient wisdom.
do you recognise this?
yea...
do not get involved.
I warn you. - I'm not one of your followers.
I don't believe you have the power to cure or to curse, so spare me.
it does not matter what you believe. You would not be spared.
he's not just angry, Alex. He's scared.
did you make this doll?
did you send this to Vancliff?
this doll is made of Plasticine and blood.
I think it's human blood, Jenny Stark's blood, and there'll be DNA of your own there too, of your sweat, of your skin.
voodoo works both ways!
how does he get those kids to trust him?
you've seen him work a crowd, Alex.
he uses hysteria, mesmerises the audience, puts them in a trance-like state, and then they'll do whatever he tells them to.
even lie down and die?
Vancliff was already suffering from heart disease, and he was taking medication, so he clearly knew about it.
what sparked the coronary? - Fear, panic, stress.
we found trace amounts of cocaine, but nothing that would have induced a heart attack or hallucinations.
Vancliff was under stress.
you shut down his site. You dragged him in for an interview.
you make it sound like I killed him.
Alex, he thought he saw one of his victims coming towards him.
that is about guilt.
the doll triggered an association with something he did or someone he hurt, and the stress brought on the coronary.
so the witchcraft worked. - Not in the way you mean.
how do you know what I mean?
the effects are all in your mind, Alex, except that's the worst place for them to be.
you said this was some sort of asthmatic attack?
that's what we're treating her for, but she's not responding.
any news on Paula? Jeez. - They've asked to contact her next of kin.
guv, someone left something in my car.
what kind of something?
the same sort of something that Vancliff... Shit!
Kevin, talk to me!
I know what I saw. The head came off the doll.
five minutes later, my head nearly comes off as well.
Where's the doll now? - Forensics are running tests.
for all the good that'll do.
how's he doing this?
he isn't doing anything. Someone planted the doll to frighten you like they frightened Vancliff.
Yeah, what someone? How did they arrange for me to run into the back of a truck?
they didn't. The doll had rattled you. You weren't paying attention and you crashed.
come on, Kevin, what were you doing when it happened?
were you on the phone?
the only cause and effect here is in your imagination.
what about Paula? She imagining what's happening to her?
Kevin, go and get cleaned up.
the names carved on the bodies, it wasn't just Jesus, it was Esus, the Celtic god of the underworld.
right now, I'm more concerned about who planted the doll in Kevin's car.
kingston must have a follower. A helper on the outside.
and now they're targeting the police?
I think it's time we check out his congregation.
what about the painter? Mm-hm. - Louis Blake?
the murals on Kingston's temple, I think Blake might have painted them.
we've already checked out his studio and his home. We found nothing.
can I look?
guess who owns this place.
Vancliff? - Not big on maintenance, is he?
Oh, look... Looks like it's been redecorated.
recently. - What, by Vancliff?
must have been Blake.
it's a bit flowery for him, isn't it?
my God...
is that meant to be Paula?
it looks like Kevin was right. - What? Sorry?
kingston must have induced Paula's asthma. He got Blake to make the doll.
Yeah, but Paula's never seen that doll.
she would have said something, so it can't be affecting her, subliminally or otherwise.
Paula's never had asthma. Now she's critically ill.
so there must be some other cause. She must be reacting to an allergen or something.
no. They tested for it, and how come no-one else was affected?
Alex, witchcraft works on the mind of the victim, suggesting they've been cursed.
if you don't know about it, it ain't going to work.
can there be some other causality that we don't understand?
can the knife, the dolls focus somebody's malice somehow?
on what physical level? You see, that doesn't make sense.
I don't care if it makes sense! I just want Paula to get better.
Alex, there is no such thing as action at a distance, and there's no such thing as magic.
do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
I'm going home.
wait.
Hi! How's it going? - Frantic.
Ben's been asleep since eight, and there's some pasta in the oven.
Oh, brilliant.
some friends of mine run a playgroup at the park cafe. I was going to take Ben tomorrow.
should be fine.
great. Don't worry. I'll see you tomorrow. - Sorry.
the Plasticine in all three dolls came from Kingston's place.
the pigment came from Blake's studio and the blood came from Jenny Stark.
one thing though, the blood on Kingston's knife wasn't hers.
I mean, it isn't even human. - So he bleached it after the murders.
any sign of Blake? - The guy's got no home, no family, no friends. He could be anywhere.
you still in the office? - I've got some things to sort out.
night. - Yeah, night.
you've just got to ask the right questions.
why did they go for Paula, and what did they do to her?
how did they get to her?
you're saying he was oblivious to pain? Like he was out of his head on something?
it was more than that. He didn't even react to a faceful of ammonia.
he's in some sort of trance.
what, you mean like a zombie?
Yeah. That's exactly what he was like.
zombies were subjects acting under hypnotic suggestion before they knew what the suggestion was.
but who put him in a trance? Kingston's locked up.
maybe he did it himself.
it's difficult, but it's possible.
the unconscious mind overrides every safety mechanism you have, like pain, fear, exhaustion.
it can affect your pulse, your blood pressure...
it's not a good time. She's barely conscious.
stop the medication. That's what's making her sick.
that's absurd! - Can't you put it on hold for a few minutes?
right, Paula...
look at me.
Kevin, are you all right?
just er... I hate bloody hospitals.
Tony? - I think she'll be OK.
what did you do?
I think he's going to make a phone call.
I'd still like to keep her under observation.
she had all the classic symptoms. - Because someone gave her them.
someone planted a suggestion in her mind that she couldn't catch her breath.
when she collapsed, the doctors diagnosed asthma, give her steroids, that makes things worse.
but how did you cure her? - I didn't cure her, Alex. She wasn't sick.
I just planted a suggestion in her mind that counteracted the first one.
she got better because she believed she would? - The placebo effect.
it means, "I will please you," but there's an opposite known as the nocebo effect.
it means, "I will harm you."
people sicken and die because they believe they can't be cured or they believe someone has cursed them.
Louis Blake is dead.
your acolyte, your apprentice, whatever he was, so, just lay off the spells.
you're not frightening anyone.
you're on your own, Dr. Kingston.
Yeah, artist therapy didn't work for you, did it?
real pain, real fear, that's what inspired you.
Ah, "my muse..."
the inspiration.
there's no tattoo. Now, why's that?
so, either this was painted before...
that's a timid, submissive, manipulated girl. This...
confident, assured...
it's a woman.
Yeah, this isn't Jenny.
Ayesha, it's Alex. I came to school to meet you and Ben.
I'm going to the park cafe. Call me when you pick up this message.
Tony? - Blake didn't put himself in that trance. He didn't have the talent.
slow down. - He couldn't have made those dolls, because the one thing he did have was technique.
these dolls, they're crude, amateurish. They're almost childlike.
what are you saying? - A young woman.
Yeah, she modelled for Blake. - Another apprentice?
no. She sent Blake to kill me.
she framed Kingston for Jonas' death.
he's not scared of us, he's scared of her. She is stronger than him.
look, she can win your trust absolutely when you hardly even know her.
she could be right in front of us.
you might have even interviewed her.
I'm looking for Ayesha Simon.
she's 22, got sallow skin, she might be with a little boy...
Hey, Alex, are you OK? - Ayesha, where's Ben?
isn't he with you? That detective collected him.
what detective? - At the school. She said you sent her to pick him up.
no... I thought she was one of your... - Oh, no! Oh, God!
OK, now, most of you will know by now, half an hour ago, DI Fielding's son Ben was abducted from outside his school gates.
Paula, shouldn't you be... I'm fine.
all right, now, we have a description of the suspect.
she's a mixed-race girl in her late 20s, pale complexion, brown eyes, mid-length dark hair.
now, she hasn't made contact. And she isn't going to.
somehow, this girl managed to convince the nanny she was a police officer.
she's extremely clever at subliminal persuasion.
using vocal and physical cues, she can convince anyone of anything and then make them forget she was even there.
she phoned in the tip-off for the Vancliff site.
no, but that caller was male. - Are you sure?
can you even remember the conversation, Kevin?
I think I met her. On the site, after we found Jonas's heart.
she said she was Vancliff's girlfriend. - That could be true.
he tells her about his condition, she induces the heart attack that kills him.
this woman believes she's a witch. She's ritually murdered two children.
the first gave her power. The second makes her invisible.
now she's taken the son of a policewoman.
she thinks if she sacrifices him, it'll make her immune to the law.
sorry, Kevin.
Paula? Take a team to Vancliff's place. - What do you need?
look for photographs, documents, clothing that might have her DNA.
I'm going to talk to his bouncers, see what they know.
I should have been there.
he's like an orphan!
Hey, Alex...
I used to hold his hand.
and tell him that everything would be OK.
I promised him I would never let anyone take him away from me.
we'll find him.
I betrayed him. - No.
right, look, you shouldn't be here.
where else am I going to be?
it can't have been Bernice. She's a little peach. - What was her surname?
I think he met her in a bar or club somewhere.
do you have an address for her? A phone number? Anything?!
no photos and no documents.
we've got prints, DNA, hairs, fibres... We need to find a match.
that's if she even has a record. - Keep on. We'll keep looking.
how long have we got? She's not acting on impulse.
she'll want to perform the ritual properly, so there'll be some sort of external cue, like sunrise, or...
sunset.
an hour from now.
I don't know how I missed it. - Not now, Tony!
she is not a witch. She is a murderer, and you understand murderers, so think!
she kills children. - And?
and a child's life, it gives more power. So is that it? Is that all this is?
look, Jenny was abandoned by her parents, so she is angry and desperate for affection and acceptance.
Jonas' mother left him so they're both vulnerable.
and I...I kept them calm.
right up until the end, they think they're going home.
so that is what she cherishes.
despair, betrayal, abandonment.
you're acting out.
you were betrayed as a child.
you were abandoned by your mother and...
and your father.
they took your heart, they tore it out and they buried it.
I need to speak to Kingston.
she's taken another child.
the woman who killed Jenny Stark and Jonas Nkomo.
it's her you fear. You're chanting to protect yourself from her.
I don't think she wants to kill you.
I think she wants to make you suffer, and I think I know why.
see, sometimes it takes years to develop a serial killer, because sometimes, they were victims themselves.
they were rejected, abused, betrayed.
she has fantasies of power and revenge, and one day, something just sparks them off.
they lose a job or someone leaves them.
you betrayed her.
when we first met, you had a new assistant. Why did you fire the old one?
because she was good at her job or because she was better than you?
Yeah, she frightens you.
she has gifts you don't understand.
I understand them.
that girl was conceived by demons.
Yeah, demons walk among us every day in human form. Are you a demon?
you're her father, aren't you?
when you rejected, her, she lost her home, her job and her family all at the same time.
she was born of my lust, but she is not my daughter.
her mother, was she English? - No, Scottish.
and did you send her to Africa as a child?
we tried to drive out the evil spirits.
so we're talking confinement, starvation, torture...
they thought they had succeeded, but the demons, they deceived them.
did it ever occur to you that if you tell a little girl over and over that she is evil, she's going to believe it?
she killed Vancliff to frame you.
she tried to kill two police officers because she despises all authority figures.
and now she's taken a little boy... and she's going to kill him, because his mother is a policewoman.
I am sorry.
where will she have taken him? You must know.
when you threw her out, did she contact you? Did she write to you?
moonrise.
that is the propitious time.
Propitious? - For the sacrifice.
along the river. That's where the other two... - That's 150 miles!
warehouses, docks, derelict sites. Yes, but it's not just a river to her.
it washes away evidence. It baptises, it sanitises.
she's worshiping Teutates, the river god.
her mother's Scottish, so she identifies with the Celts.
the belief, the ritual... Look at these abrasions.
from being dragged along stone. Some ancient Celtic site.
is there a barrow or a stone circle?
not in the city, then. Out here.
in the forest, by the river. It's a tumulus.
we used to hike up that way. There's a circle of stones in a clearing. - With an altar?
Esus, lord of he underworld,
Jesus, lord of the living world, to you I dedicate this life, this death.
drop the weapon! Armed police! Drop the weapon! Now!
Ben! - Mum?
Where's she gone? Spread out! Spread out!
me and Bernice were doing magic. Were you, darling? Let's get you home.
don't let anyone pass. She's still armed.
where the hell has she gone? - She hasn't. She's still here.
stay close together. Check the trees. Right, guv.
what are you doing?! Shut up! You're under arrest!
Oh, for God's sake, she's still out there!
good to have you back.
this is silly, isn't it, because in no sense am I the one you're looking for.
it just isn't me.
I'm sorry. Well, you're amazing.
your vocal technique and your body language... - It's a mix-up.
in the dark, in the mist...
take my hand. Here.
really see me.
I'm not the one you want.
see, all those hidden words... It's...
In-no-sense.
you've got "release." "Just-is Mist-take..." You are... You're very gifted.
your eyes... They hurt, don't they?
they want to weep tears of blood.
your heart, feel it clench like a fist.
smell the flesh rotting on your bones.
taste the worms in your mouth.
no, I feel fine, but thanks for asking.
and you disappeared in plain sight in front of nearly 20 people.
you saw me. Well, I'm sort of weird that way.
I don't see the obvious, but I spot the hidden.
that's why I'm here. - You're here because you broke my knife.
I knew you for my enemy.
no, I don't have any magical powers, Bernice, and neither do you.
you control people by subliminal suggestion. It's not witchcraft.
just like Louis Blake. - Louis?
he was so pathetic, learning spells from books. He had no idea.
what's your real name? - You know my true name.
Bernice, I'm not a witch.
I'm a psychologist.
how long do I have?
before your familiars come.
and the necklace. - That's for protection.
sorry, everything. - No, you can't have it!
we'll keep it safe. - Don't touch me!
calm down. - Let me go! Let me go!
please don't!
lord of the dead, send your demons!
feed on their flesh! Tear their skin!
bathe in their blood!
calm down. We don't want to hurt you.
Oh, my God! I'm really sorry!
don't put me in a hole! Please don't let me die!
they've suggested therapy to help him get over the trauma.
does he look traumatised to you? - Nope.
you do. - I'm fine.
no, you're not.
no, I'm not.
I'm not going to be able to let him out of my sight.
you talk to someone. Take a break and spend some time with Ben.
ask that really nice nanny to come back.
ayesha? Is that a joke? - Just make sure she asks for ID.
don't hold on to the fear, Alex.
it's how we make our nightmares come true.
Hello, sweetheart.
No! No! No!
next time on wire in the blood
he moves in, gains their confidence, and then he strikes.
is it business or pleasure? - Couldn't it be both?
you made it. Good to see you.
which one is it?
it's face to face. It's not from behind, so he doesn't mind if they see him.
so, one he strips completely, and the other he strips and dresses as the victim five years before.
rape, kill, take.
she wasn't wearing those when we found her.
he's a trophy-taker.
he keeps it, so he can prolong the sexual fantasy of raping and killing.
or does he give it to someone close to him, so that every time she wears it, it reminds him of his pleasure?
they're lovely. Thank you.
you know, this is a partial re-labelling a partial re-identification.
but it's also a message. - A message? Who for?
you, most likely.
so, if he was raping and killing in Denmark in 2002, what's he been doing since?
exactly.
maybe we're asking the question the wrong way round.
inge, 2002. Cinzia, 2004.
Monica and our unknown victim, 2007.
instead of asking why did he originally kill, what we should be asking is why here, why now?
who is this?!
who is this?
he's at the height of his killing spree. He's a supernova waiting to implode.
I know.
I'm sorry.
what's on your mind?
for the most part.
tell me how you're feeling about Don right now.
I love him.
how's it feel to say that?
it feels good.
it feels like I've come a long way.
but...?
but I'm conflicted about what I can tell him...
about my past, about what's going on with me.
afraid he'll reject you.
seems like those trust issues are flaring up again.
old habits die hard, I guess.
especially when you're about to make a long-term commitment.
you know, relationships grow through communication, and so you need to really open up to Don.
I know.
I'm going to.
it's amazing how you can work on all your issues and yet somehow they reappear in some new form.
issues are forever.
we don't get a free pass just because we're therapists.
how are things with your clients?
they're fine.
do you mind if we end a little early today?
sure.
you've done your time in the hot seat.
now, you get your office back.
Thanks, Richard.
see you next time.
Hey, brother.
hope I didn't break up a big night.
every night's a big night.
all right, what do we got?
we got Gina Hill, shrink.
left her office around 7: 00.
this is as far as she got.
who called it in?
building security.
looks like a robbery gone bad.
I don't know.
her ID's missing, but there's still 200 bucks in cash in her purse.
looks like she went down swinging.
there's scuff marks from her shoes when she was dragged away...
...probably to a truck or an SUV, based on the rubber that was laid down.
then they smashed through the guard arm at the exit.
whoever did this wasn't taking no for an answer.
she was supposed to be home around 7: 00.
at 8: 00, when she didn't call and I couldn't reach her,
I had the building security check and see if her car was still there.
it'd only been an hour.
how do you know she just wasn't running late?
because she made a point of saying that she'd be home.
that we needed to talk.
about what?
I assumed it was about the wedding.
seating plan, maybe.
you're getting married.
next month.
how long have you been together?
almost a year.
any problems in the relationship?
no.
especially not lately.
were there problems before?
I mean, at the beginning, we were moving at different speeds.
Gina'd be the first to say that she has a problem with commitment.
but about six months ago, when we set a date for the wedding, it was like a turning point, you know?
she opened up, we got closer.
I mean, since then, things have been great.
you work at the public defender's office, right?
that's right.
is there any bad blood between you and any of your clients?
sometimes.
when I don't get them acquitted, which is most of the time.
are there any sex offenders in your caseload?
now, look, I get the drill.
I know you have to ask these questions, but I don't think this is about my clients.
if anything, it's about Gina's.
no, I...
I just won't, okay?
I don't know how may different ways I need to say it.
not anymore I won't.
look, this is...
this is my home.
you can't just call...
look, I don't...
I don't want to do this anymore.
I don't have anything else to say.
don't call here again.
Gina, you okay?
what's going on?
it's just one of my patients.
how'd he get this number?
I gave it to him in case of an emergency, but he's obviously abusing the privilege.
this guy dangerous?
no, he's just upset.
do you want me to call Lieutenant Geiger?
he owes me a favor.
no. It's not a police situation.
it's just a professional issue.
I can handle it.
okay.
then you'll get rid of him?
of course.
the next day, she told me that she had terminated him.
I thought that was the end of it.
did she tell you his name?
no, she didn't.
she's a real stickler about patient confidentiality.
okay, have you seen anyone suspicious hanging around the house?
the same car driving by over and over?
anything like that?
I don't think so.
maybe I should have paid more attention.
is there anyone else that she may have talked to about this client of hers?
her therapist, possibly.
he works in the same building.
his name's Richard Seidel.
Viv, the Peters office sent a list of Don's clients.
so far, no one's talking, but the phone records indicate that he was right.
they got eight phone calls to the house that day, all from the same number.
whose number?
it's a pay phone in Soho.
what about friends and family?
I talked to three of her girlfriends, and they didn't know anything, so I'm assuming she's more of a listener than a talker.
she's a shrink.
true.
how about Exthe Explorer?
one that took her drove a blue '95.
the lab I. D.'d trim and paint from the scene.
so, if he's one of Gina's patients, all we have to do is check who drives an Explorer.
but we don't know who her patients are.
and, without probable cause, no judge is going et us look into her files.
he doesn't need to know.
just kidding.
I'm headed over to the court, see what I can do.
you see what you can find out.
how am I supposed to do that?
be creative...
and keep it legal.
I know. It's more fun the other way.
you know that.
I just had a session with Gina last night.
what did you two talk about?
you know I can't discuss that.
what about her emotional state?
is that confidential, too?
she was preoccupied.
but nothing came up that would speak to her getting abducted.
she talk to you about her clients?
sometimes that's all we talk about.
so, if she was having a problem with someone, she would tell you.
she usually does.
has she mentioned anything to you about cutting one of her patients loose?
she terminated with a client?
a client who was calling her at home
harassing her.
this puts what happened to her last week in a different light.
Richard, good morning.
I was just about to leave you a very passive-aggressive note on your door.
I missed our session!
first time in four years.
got me searching for a hidden meaning.
Richard, I'm so sorry.
I totally forgot.
there's no such thing as forgetting.
only avoidance.
don't shrink a shrink.
maybe we can make it up later this week?
sure. We could...
hold it.
did you lock up on Friday?
does it look like anything's missing?
I don't know. I can't tell.
must be those kids again.
we'd had a few half-assed break-ins over the past year
kids after prescription pads, drugs.
I just assumed that they were responsible.
I don't think Gina did.
she never filed a police report.
do you know if she had any potentially violent clients?
kidnappers?
sex offenders?
possibly. She takes on sliding-scale, pro bono cases.
that can be a crapshoot.
but you can't tell us who they are, can you?
I don't know who they are.
look, Gina was thriving at work, in her personal life.
overall, she was in a great place.
you two seem pretty close.
we're colleagues.
we have a professional relationship.
nothing more.
after your session with Gina last night, where did you go?
I had clients until 8: 00.
then I went to dinner with my wife.
you can check.
I will.
Yes. Yes, I'm still here.
no. No, no. Look.
there were three refills in that prescription.
your records are wrong, man, because I've only used two of them.
okay, just call Dr. Carlisle.
I'm sure he'll fax over a new prescription.
he did.
fine. Fine.
I'll call him myself.
I got to tell you, I'm...
I'm having a hell of a time I. D. Gina Hill's clients.
okay, most of her patients bill through insurance, so we can't get those records either, but I got her bank to turn over these canceled checks to deposit them into her account.
that was smart.
now, five of these people, they pay her every week, so I'm thinking they have to be patients, right?
sounds good.
this guy's interesting.
convicted sex offender.
rape.
so, what kind of car you drive, Malcolm?
78 Cutlass.
clean title, from the dealer.
no SUVs in the family?
no.
you sure you didn't steal one last night?
hell, no.
did you call Gina Hill at her house?
you mean my shrink?
that Gina Hill.
no, I only left messages on the office phone for appointments and crap.
why were you seeing her?
court-ordered.
you know, to supposedly help me with my urges.
must have been hard sitting in the same room with Gina.
actually, I like them a little older.
more experience.
I got no love for Gina.
and why's that?
let's just say she's not the kind of shrink that can help me.
that got pretty clear two nights ago.
she's out screwing around and she's going to make me better?
after all, you've got standards.
she was a hypocrite.
you know, the more high and mighty people act, the more they got something to hide.
look, describe this guy.
tall...
...long hair...
30-ish.
I didn't get that good a look at him.
you know why?
because it never happened.
it did happen.
she was there just like I said.
was there a car parked outside, as well?
a blue Explorer.
you sure it was a blue Explorer?
are you familiar with the Cupid Motel?
pass it on the way to work.
Why?
we believe that your fiancée was seen there two nights ago with another man.
there's no way.
Gina was not having an affair.
I didn't say that she was, but now that we're on the subject, it never occurred to you that she might be?
no, it didn't.
not even after those phone lls?
no.
Mr. McGraw, you're a public defender.
you're suspicious by nature, correct?
of defendants and trial lawyers, not of my fiancée.
but if she was having an affair, there's be red flags and you would notice them, right?
I don't know.
Mr. McGraw, was there anything odd going on in your relationship recently?
there was a photograph.
it came about a week and a half ago.
Hey, baby.
what is this?
it was addressed to me.
Where'd it come from, Gina?
I sent it.
you sent it?
want to explain that?
I found it in some old boxes.
I thought you might like it.
who took this picture?
I did.
I took it. -why
so that when my boobs are hanging to the ground we'll have proof that it wasn't always that way?
I thought it might turn you on.
a little heads-up would have been nice.
how do you think I look?
pretty damn good.
what are you going to do about it?
I believed her.
you did?
I did.
people lie to you all day long.
why would you believe that story?
are you a jealous man, Mr. McGraw?
I didn't think there was anything to be jealous of.
so it never occurred to you that whoever took that photo might have been sleeping with your fiancée?
okay, I'm going to leave now.
what's your sex life like at home?
you want me to draw you a picture?
Yes, I want a detailed portrait of what your relationship was like.
I'd like to see my lawyer now.
fine.
you still have the picture?
cause I'm going to need it.
Dr. Harris, thanks for coming.
you're welcome.
so what do you think?
fiancé certainly has motive, but I don't think he's your problem.
did you check her history for any patient complaints?
not yet. Why?
she may have crossed the line with a patient.
sexually?
she's frequenting motels and trolling for men.
that would suggest judgment issues.
a therapist with a sexual dysfunction.
we're not all perfect, Jack.
I'm starting to figure that out.
all right, fingerprints were a bust, but every picture tells a story, and this was taken in Gina's bedroom.
if you compare the boudoir shot to her DMV photo from last month,
I would sait was taken six months ago or longer.
based on?
tan lines.
could have been last summer.
what's this blur from?
motion from the shutter being pressed and released.
so someone else took this picture.
and based on the sight lines, somebody tall.
I got a line on our Ford Explorer.
great. Where?
greenwich, Connecticut. 8:30 this morning,
parking Enforcement wrote a ticket for an expired meter.
how do we know it's ours?
sorry. Johnson.
it came up stolen and the headlights were broken.
I'm going to go check it out.
okay.
Thanks. that'll have to do.
what?
bad news is the judge won't let us in to Gina's patients' files.
and the good news?
we can have her appointment book.
we were piecing together her schedule, and we came across this three days ago.
she had a session here with a Drew S. and, she made this notation next to it.
any idea what it means?
everybody has their own system, but "F/U" is probably "follow-up," and...
I'm guessing the "H" is for "home.
so she was going to call her client at home. Is that unusual?
no.
no, I imagine she didn't want to wait till the next session.
maybe something came up.
okay, that works for me.
Thanks, Lisa. -Sure.
Hey, Martin.
how you doing?
what do you mean?
you must be phased off your pain meds by now.
I am.
any feelings of nausea, nervousness?
Nope.
no after-effects from the shooting, physical, emotional?
what, people are talking or something?
no.
no, it's just a routine follow-up.
right.
no, actually, I'm,...
I'm pretty much 100% now.
good.
glad to hear it.
Thanks. -Sure.
so, Drew S. is Drew Sharp.
she popped up on the phone records from Gina's office.
that's good.
you need me to set up an interview?
already done.
you know, this whole thing could have been avoided if she wasn't meeting guys in sleazy motels.
Gina's the victim here, Martin.
she's also a professional.
just because you can give advice doesn't necessarily mean you can take it, right?
but shouldn't she have more control over herself?
okay, I'm sure that's something she struggles with every day.
Mr. Goodbar's not the solution.
so by that time I was a drug addict and I was suicidal.
I hated myself.
I hated everyone in the world.
but Gina, Gina saved my life.
before that I was just hanging out with...
drew, please.
one second.
so okay, you had a session with her three days ago, right?
I see her twice a week.
she made a note to follow up with you afterwards. Did she?
she tried.
I didn't take her calls.
why not?
our last session, it got really weird.
but all the weirdness was coming from Gina for a change.
you know how I've been doing all this work so I'd quit seeking out men who treat me like crap?
I seem to recall a few conversations like that, yes.
I met this guy, and I don't know.
I took one look, I knew I should run in the other direction.
tell me about him.
he was cute, troubled;
perfect.
and how did you handle that?
look, I know I'm supposed to recognize my triggers.
but...?
but it's like I couldn't stop myself.
so we kind of hooked up last night.
and how did it make you feel?
it was...
it was the most amazing, mind-blowing sex ever.
ever!
I mean, I knew that I shouldn't do it.
sitting there with him, drinking scotch in the hotel bar, but Vince, he just looked at me.
and it was... -His name is Vince?
and it was like I-I...
and what hotel was it?
at the Leighton.
you know, like, the fancy one;
like, tablecloths and candles and...
is that where you first met him?
no, this is what's weird.
I met him right outside this building, after our last session.
you need to stay away from him, Drew.
what do you mean?
I know him and he's dangerous.
you know him?
is he a patient?
I want you to stay away from him.
do you understand me?
I'd never seen Gina that way before.
you think you can help us with a sketch of this guy?
it's Vince.
as here partying a few nights back, but first time I seen him since he got canned.
so he wasn't the model employee.
no. They caught him skimming the till about a year and a half ago.
I was surprised he even stopped by.
did you ever see him with this woman?
she was here for some shrink conference.
must have been about two years ago.
it's the first time I seen Vince in action.
it's on the house.
Thanks.
you're a shrink?
don't hold it against me.
want to ask me a few questions, try and figure me out?
doesn't really work that way.
it does for me.
cause I got you pegged.
I doubt that.
pretty as you are...
you're marked.
I can see it.
do cliches actually work for you?
67% of the time.
I've done the math.
seriously, I'm a psychic with these ladies.
I can look deep in their hearts and I know what they really need.
so try me.
for you.
what's your name?
love always comes with a dose of pain.
right?
and the less you get, the more you chase after it.
until you wind up where you are right now.
Where's that?
sitting here staring at me hoping the next martini's going to give you enough courage to say yes when I ask you up to your room with me.
you won't be sorry.
needless to say, she left with him when his shift was done.
did you ever see them together again?
they had a thing.
but then Vince got fired and I haven't seen her since.
he's in the system.
that's an impressive resume.
larceny, grand larceny, auto theft, armed robbery.
guy's ally moving up in the world.
last known address is Reno, Nevada.
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to give his picture to hotels and motels because he needs to be staying somewhere.
right. -Martin, we just got a hit on that parking ticket.
okay.
good work.
good.
show him.
so this video was taken at a pawn shop in Greenwich at 8: 15 this morning.
the Explorer was parked a block away.
there's Vince Weaver.
and that's Gina with him.
what's she doing?
you know, Gina has a clean record, Vince doesn't.
so maybe he forced her to buy the shotgun for him.
he was standing right there.
all she had to do was start screaming or run, you don't think?
I don't know, but the last three times he was arrested he had female accomplices.
maybe he's like a pied piper, getting women to run with his magic flute.
that's one way of looking at it.
bureau prison's bringing one of the women in.
I'll ask her.
I haven't seen that face in a long time.
wish I hadn't seen it at all.
you know, the police report says that you and Vince stole a car and led the cops on a high-speed chase.
how is it that he's out and you're not?
he had a bag of coke, asked me to hold it.
I got charged with intent to sell.
let me ask you something.
how does a soccer mom from Poughkeepsie end up taking a joyride with a guy like Vince?
as stupid as it sounds...
smell.
I went out to dinner with some girlfriends,
Vince was our waiter.
all night long he kept leaning over my shoulder, making jokes.
never, like, really touching me...
but I could smell him.
when I got home I couldn't even look at my husband.
so how long did the affair last?
three weeks.
but with Vince everything kept escalating.
escalated how?
first we had sex at his place and then at my house and then in my backyard against a tree.
each time it got more and more...
dangerous.
anyway, with Vince, that's what it's all about.
it's not enough for him to possess a woman...
he has to destroy her.
Yes, I know who Vince Weaver is.
and that just slipped your mind the last time we talked?
you were asking me about her patients, not anyone else.
but you knew they were involved.
they're not involved.
they haven't been for a long time.
I didn't know Vince had anything to do with this.
what do you actually know about this guy?
he's a drifter.
he'd show up in town, they'd get together.
a charismatic guy, a bad boy persona.
it's not just a persona.
he has quite a rap sheet.
when was the last time she saw him?
six months ago.
Gina, just tell me what happened.
I called Vince last night.
we got together.
where?
right here.
so this is where you work...
where people tell you their darkest secrets.
I missed you, Gina.
let's just do this.
right, you don't want to hear that from me.
that's not what I'm for?
no dinner parties and small talk...
just...
this?
but when we get started and I take you to that edge...
I own you.
and you'd do anything for me?
wouldn't you, baby?
I threw up after.
Gina, what do you think that means?
thanks for the support.
you acted with purpose, Gina.
you sought him out. Why?
I guess that's just who I am.
I'm tired of trying to change it.
what happened two days ago?
what does it matter?
you told me you had a big talk with Don.
what was it about?
it was about marriage.
and that's what this is about.
you've been with Don eight months, he loves you, he wants to get closer and that's too scary.
so you acted out.
I need to tell Don.
course, so you can sabotage the relationship cause you don't feel worthy of real love.
see this behavior for what it is, Gina.
why do I keep doing this?
it's like I'm going backwards.
because marrying Don would require you to make a leap of faith.
I don't know what to do.
do you love him?
then just jump.
she went back to Don, they got engaged shortly after that.
and as far as I know, she never saw Vince again.
why would she get involved with somebody like that in the first place?
an absent, withholding father.
but Gina did a lot of work on herself to break her patterns.
obviously, not quite enough work.
this isn't what it looks like.
it can't be.
have you ever seen him before?
did Gina ever mention him?
no.
no, none of this makes sense.
Mr. McGraw, often when we look for someone we find out things that even their loved ones don't know.
no.
no, you're wrong about Gina.
she loves me.
I'm sure you're right.
look, why don't you head on home and I'll call you if there's any news.
Martin, a clerk at the Fair brook Motel just ID'd Vince as a guest.
Danny and Viv are checking it out now.
okay.
Thanks.
put your hands where I can see them!
clear! -Clear.
all right, what's your name?
Where's Vince?
I don't know what you're talking about.
then whose boots are those?
I don't know?
I'm going to freeze my ass off.
you should've worn your thermal panties.
Where's Gina?
I'm not talking to you, okay?
I'm going back inside where it's warm.
sweet thing like you, your ass will be more than warm in jail.
what are you talking about?
we're talking about you doing life in prison for kidnapping.
I didn't kidnap anybody.
then tell us what happened.
I haven't seen Gina since she came to the motel two nights ago.
I knew you'd come around sooner or later.
nice, Vince, this is nice.
is she underage?
no.
this is Toni.
that's nice.
I want you out of my life.
no, no, no, you don't.
I let it slide, Vince, the phone calls and the picture and the break-in.
and then you go after my client?
my client?!
you know what's funny?
she moans like you.
you are a pig.
and I want you to stop it now. -no!
it could've stopped a long time ago, but you're the one, you had to...
I will call the police.
if you call the cops, you want to know what happens?!
I'm going to tell Don you've been stepping out on him.
I don't care, Vince!
I don't care!
because I'm going to tell him.
it's time I told him.
it's over.
it ain't.
it's over, Vince. -No, you're going to be back.
Gina, you're going to be back just like you always are, Gina!
because you always come back!
the next day he went and grabbed her.
he said she'd like it.
what was she doing buying a gun?
they went to pull off a heist.
what heist?
what heist?!
Vince broke into her office and got some names of some patients.
he Googled them.
one of them had big bucks.
what was the patient's name?
michael something.
and have you heard from Gina at all?
okay, we'll be in touch.
where are we on Gina's clients?
she's got a couple of clients named Michael.
I've talked to them both.
they're fine.
I think I've found a third one.
an ex-client.
check it out.
it looks like he quit seeing her six months ago.
and what's his story?
let's find out, shall we?
he's a big-time commodities trader.
I was just about to call the police.
you just saved yourself a quarter.
why don't you just back it off.
sit in the chair.
Where's Gina?
I don't know. They left.
I thought he was going to kill me...
just settle down, okay?
back it up, start at the beginning.
there was a knock at the door...
this is unexpected.
isn't that the truth.
what are you doing?
Gina, what is this?
give us your money now.
I don't have any cash.
you work on Wall Street, man, come on.
all my assets are frozen.
I'm going through a divorce.
she took everything.
even the furniture.
I swear, all I've got is what's on me.
it's like 40 bucks.
forty bucks?
you know what, -I guess you win some and you lose some.
you like this...
see that?
look, you're flushed now.
you like it.
hell of a rush, isn't it?
don't you tell me Don does it for you.
not like that.
come on, let's...let's...
let's go back to the motel.
no, you see...
we've got to take care of something first.
you see him?
he's seen us.
this is all you, baby.
you can do this.
no.
you can, baby. -No.
you're going to do it for us.
no, Vince, I can't.
take the gun.
Take...See?
that's it.
you feel that?
there you go.
hold it tight,' cause it's got a big kick.
point it right there.
you go, baby.
right there.
Gina, please.
I knew you were too good to be...
I ran.
I hid in a crawl space under the house.
I didn't come out until I was sure they were gone.
how long ago was this?
maybe five minutes.
okay, I want you just to sit tight, okay?
you calling the office?
tell them to get agents over to Gina's house and all the places Vince has been.
Yes, sir.
I can't believe it!
you tried to kill me.
me!
you know...
what do you think...
after all we've been through because of this guy.
so what do you think is going to happen now?
what do you think is going to happen now?
Vince, just...
just let him go.
shut up!
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Jack, he's here
he's here at Gina's house.
okay, we're going to send the cavalry in.
don't do anything until they get there.
things are coming apart in there. I got to go.
you betrayed me, Gina!
just like all you women do!
just stop, okay?
just stop this, and...and...
and you can walk away.
no, no.
I'm going to walk away when I'm done here.
listen, you can take some money.
this isn't about money.
it never was.
okay, okay...
please, just...Vince...
just leave him out of this, okay?
you don't want me to hurt this fine, upstanding man of yours?
cause I'm inclined to blow his head off.
please, Vince, okay?
baby, baby, baby...
I'll do anything
just let him go.
I'll do anything you want.
anything?
you're going to have to work really hard to change my mind.
I'm going to give you whatever you want.
see...that's what I'm talking about.
let's...
let's let Don get a good view of this one.
FBI. Drop the gun.
good thing you got here when you did.
it easily could have gone the other way.
excuse me.
mommy had to leave for work early, Ethan.
she had a meeting.
she always has meetings.
that's not true.
I miss Mommy.
I know, sweetie, but you'll see her later.
is she going to be home to read me a story?
she's going to do her best.
I am not happy.
just think of all the fun you'll have with your friends at school.
get anything out of the nanny?
just that the guy's tall, about six-two.
so what happened?
well, apparently the guy popped up out of nowhere, slammed the nanny's head against the car and took off with the kid.
a carjacking gone wrong?
Nah. He knew that kid was in the car.
Yeah. Rover's worth close to 100 grand.
sounds like these people have some cash.
sure looks like it, doesn't it?
dad's an R&D guy for Genacore Pharmaceuticals.
mom's a lobbyist.
Taylor.
uh, all right.
so much for the carjacking.
all right, thanks.
find the Rover?
Yeah, but the kid's not in it.
www. ydy. com/bbs- Proudly Presents
okay, keep me posted.
ERT says that the Rover's clean
no blood, no prints.
they must've transferred the kid to another car.
any witnesses? Not yet, but we're going door to door.
we've set up checkpoints and we went wide with the boy's picture.
what's the ETA on the parents?
I think the mom just got here.
are you okay?
they took Ethan. I'm so sorry.
Mrs. Heller?
special Agent Jack Malone from the FBI.
Where's my husband?
we've contacted him.
he's on his way.
um... is there, uh, somewhere more private we could speak?
Yeah.
who would do this? Who would take Ethan?
somebody that knew your son's routine
what time he went to school, what time he came home...
God.
have you noticed anyone watching the house?
no.
have you noticed any unusual cars parked outside?
not that I remember.
Wha... Why would they do this? For money?
it's possible.
if it is a ransom, we're ready.
Mrs. Heller, uh...
I need to ask you, um...
...what kind of funds do you have available?
maybe $500, 000.
okay. Who else would know about this?
I'm not sure.
well, I need you to think about it and think about it carefully, because it could be relevant.
now, do you or your husband have any enemies?
Jim doesn't.
I'm a lobbyist for the oil industry, so you can imagine.
okay, so, have you received any threats lately?
uh... I get hate mail every day, mostly from Eco Brigade.
and they are an environmental group?
a pretty radical one.
uh, anything beyond the letters?
they picket the office.
two weeks ago, they... got past security and spray painted my car.
so they know what you drive.
they could've gotten your address from the license plate.
do you know the names of any of these people?
I know the one who harassed me the most:
come on, guys. What are you doing?
these suction-cup mikes- they fall off all the time.
get this thing hardwired.
Yeah.
okay, well, you got my number.
if you hear from him, please have him call me.
it's urgent.
what if it's my fault they took Ethan?
what if it's all because of my job?
excuse me, Jack.
I, uh, can't seem to get Mr. Heller on the phone, and he should've been here by now.
you try his office?
Yeah. They said he'd left over an hour ago.
okay, keep trying.
okay.
what? Was that about Ethan?
we're just trying to figure out where your husband is.
have you talked to him since this happened?
I couldn't get through.
he didn't call when he heard the news?
I'm sure he tried.
my cell phone died on the way here.
are the two of you having any problems?
what does that matter?
everything matters.
things have been difficult.
he's been staying at a hotel.
since when?
last week.
we've been fighting a lot lately.
it just got to be too much.
what is this?
Hey.
it's the play set we ordered.
that's not what I thought it would be; it's too big.
come on down right now.
but Mommy said I could play.
and I'm saying that you can't.
now get down before you break your neck.
I told him it was okay.
it's not okay!
why don't you just let him run off into the traffic
thank you.
Ethan, go inside for a minute, okay?
thank you.
what is wrong with you?
it's nothing.
that's not good enough.
you've been like this for weeks, Jim.
you're uptight all the time.
you blow up over nothing.
Ethan is a nervous wreck around you.
did you know he started wetting his bed again?
no.
Stephanie, I'm sorry...
I'm sick of the apologies.
what I want is an explanation.
I don't want to talk about it.
then you can't be here, Jim...
not until you figure this out.
I will not put Ethan through it anymore.
I really just wanted to shake him up...
get through to him.
he packed a bag and went to the Carson Hotel.
and you have no idea why he's been behaving this way?
I wish I knew.
he's a wonderful man.
did you two talk about custody?
we're having some problems; we're not getting divorced.
but you wouldn't allow him to be around your son.
Yes, but...
has he seen him since? No.
well, because you wouldn't allow it.
Jim had absolutely nothing to do with this.
so, you're sure Mr. Heller told you he was headed home?
of course. I mean, his kid just got grabbed.
do you think something's happened to him?
we don't know.
do you remember what time he left?
Mm... ten minutes to 10: 00.
okay, so, we called him at 9: 30.
he left at 9: 50.
where was he for 20 minutes?
he was in here with the door closed.
when he didn't come out, I- I started to get worried.
Mr. Heller, what are you still doing here?
I'm just... just finishing up a few things.
can't it wait?
you're right.
I don't know what I'm thinking.
do you need help?
is-is there something I can do for you?
no. I need to go... home.
if anyone calls, tell them I'm on my way.
we're all thinking of you.
we'll be praying for Ethan.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I just figured he froze, he got overwhelmed.
did Jim have any friends around here
you know, someone he can confide in?
he's pretty tight with Al Carter.
he's a research analyst. Viv.
check this out.
he got an email at 8: 46 this morning entitled "your son."
that's what, 15 minutes after the kid was grabbed?
now, there's no message, but he did download an attachment.
please, Daddy, do what he says.
please, Daddy, do what he says.
so, the video's only 11 seconds long.
it was uploaded onto a wireless hub at a coffee shop in Queens.
kid looks to be in the backseat of a car.
can't ID the user?
no, no, but I was able to dig out a voice.
here, listen.
tell him what I told you.
please, Daddy, do what he says.
that's a Midwest accent, maybe 30, 40 years old.
what's it picking up here?
uh, most likely vibrations from his hand, shooting the video.
now, you see the second vibration source?
the most likely frequency match on that is an engine.
the car's moving. Yeah, yeah.
I'm thinking this was shot minutes after the abduction.
well, it can't be the driver who's shooting it, so that means we have more than one kidnapper.
right, right.
any chance of IDing the car from the upholstery?
um, well, there's not a lot of detail there.
you know, the-the, uh, right answer is "Yes, sir."
Yes, sir.
right.
tell him what I told you.
please, Daddy, do what he says.
you recognize the voice?
I need to hear it again.
tell him what I told you.
please, Daddy, do what he says.
I don't think so. I can't tell.
it's okay.
we really appreciate you trying.
what does this mean?
what are they going to do to Ethan?
well, Mrs. Heller, we're doing everything we can to get your son back.
what about Jim?
we're trying to find him, too.
Hey, Jack, one second.
we tracked down Neil Brown, the angry environmentalist.
no violent priors, plus he has an alibi.
how solid?
well, he's been in Oregon for the past three days living on top of a giant redwood.
that's pretty solid.
Mm-hmm.
how we doing on tracking Heller's phone records?
he got a one-minute call from a prepaid cell just before he opened the proof-of-life video.
it's got to be the kidnappers.
well, it fits- that's why Ethan told his dad, "Do what he says.
I'm assuming he's referring to the call.
that schmuck is trying to handle this on his own.
we looked into his accounts, and he's not trying to take money out for ransom.
well, they kidnapped his son, so they want something.
Mm-hmm. Keep digging into Heller's past; let's find out what it is.
no problem.
thank you for sitting down with us, Mr. Carter.
I just hope I can help.
now, was Mr. Heller having any problems here at work?
no... um, not that I'm aware of.
he heads up the whole research division.
that's-that's certainly not an easy job.
uh, you two were pretty good friends, right?
well, I'd say we're more... colleagues these days.
why is that?
the truth is, uh, Jim's been acting a little...
odd the past month... withdrawn.
did he ever say why?
no.
and then four days ago, something really strange happened.
Hey!
Hey!
holy crap. Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
you sure? I'm fine, I'm fine.
who the hell was that?
Oh... Well, what did he want?
my wallet. I- I don't have it with me.
hold on, I'm going to call the police.
no, no, no. What are they going to do, right?
Jim, you should at least report this.
I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine, really.
just forget it.
all right.
he came to work the next day as if nothing even happened.
did you get a good look at this guy?
uh, not really.
the hood he was wearing blocked his face.
I don't know why I listened to Jim.
I mean, I should've reported it.
Jim was attacked?
unfortunately, yeah.
he never told you about it?
no.
well, we think it could be connected to the kidnapping.
how?
that's what we need you to tell us.
look, did Jim have any financial problems?
no. Uh, shaky investments, lawsuits?
does Jim have a gambling problem?
no, absolutely not. Well, look at everything that's happened
he's clearly into something.
not that I know about.
you are married, right?
Yes, but I can't imagine what it is.
well, try imagining a little harder.
excuse me for a second.
what the hell was that?
I'm sorry, man. I just feel like crap.
I don't know if it's the flu or something I ate.
no, you know, maybe you should take a sick day.
look, I'm not taking a sick day.
we're right in the middle of a case.
I'll be fine.
how we doing on Heller?
well, in the last two months, he used his credits cards at gas stations and restaurants all over upstate,
connecticut, Jersey.
you see? Hotels?
a few times.
and listen, the wife doesn't know anything about the trips.
so what else is new?
um... do you see any patterns?
well, they're all within a few hours' drive.
there's little towns, big towns.
he doesn't go to the same place twice.
romantic getaways?
well, it could be the guy that knocked him around was a jealous husband.
seems like he's driving a lot of miles to get laid.
Malone.
okay, great. We'll be right there.
NYPD just found Heller's car...
with him in it.
FBI. Where is he?
in the Beamer.
he said not to approach him, so we just stayed put.
what's he been doing?
just sitting there.
I'll go talk to him.
do you want to stay here?
sure.
Mr. Heller?
it's the FBI.
open up. I want to talk to you.
Mr. Heller,
I'm Jack Malone from the FBI.
I'm here to get your son back.
look, I know that they called you.
I know that you saw the video with Ethan, and I understand that you are scared to death.
you don't understand anything.
I know what they told you:
don't call the cops, and we won't hurt him.
you want to believe that if you do just as they say, this will just all go away
it'll disappear, be like it never happened.
but let me tell you something, Mr. Heller:
that's just wishful thinking.
I don't have a choice.
Yes, you do.
you have a choice; you're just refusing to take it.
now, they called you.
so what do they want?
it's not the ransom, because you haven't even tried to pay it.
so what do they want you to do?
I have nothing else to say.
I want you to listen to me very carefully, because what I'm about to tell you is what's going to happen next.
I am going to walk out of this car because you refuse to cooperate, and then next time we meet, it'll be in a morgue to identify the body of your dead five-year-old son.
you get the hell out.
okay.
fine.
what are you doing?!
you can't arrest me!
no, but I can detain you.
I'm not going to let your son die because you're an idiot.
Hey, Viv, check this out.
three weeks back,
Heller pulled $50, 000 out of his brokerage account.
any idea where it went?
Yeah. He transferred it to a dummy account, then wired it to an M. Villante.
okay, so maybe this M. Villante didn't think it was enough.
so what, he takes the kid to get more?
have we got an address?
FBI!
we're looking for M. Villante.
that's me- Maria Villante.
I was about to sell the house, pay for my son's medical bills.
it was like a miracle when that money showed up.
you have no idea who gave you the $50, 000?
the bank manager said the account it came from had been closed.
I just figured it was sent to me by mistake.
you know, I keep expecting somebody will ask for it back.
well, this is the man that gave it to you.
do you know who he is?
Yeah. Yeah, he's from Genacore.
it's Mr. Heller.
you work for Genacore?
no. No, my son Tommy
uh, he was in a clinical trial for Exilair.
it's their new asthma drug.
right. You have any idea why Mr. Heller would be sending you money?
no. It doesn't make any sense at all.
is your son still involved in the trials?
Tommy passed away in January.
I'm sorry.
it's hard for me to say it out loud.
um, just so we're clear here, you never met Mr. Heller before bringing your son into Genacore, is that right?
Tommy was in the trial for three years, but I didn't meet Mr. Heller then.
it wasn't until a few weeks after Tommy died.
he came to the house one night.
he was tired a lot of the time.
you know, lethargic.
so, is this normal- this kind of follow-up?
we're just collecting information that might be useful one day.
for other kids.
well, that's good.
that's important.
I think so.
okay.
before the pneumocystis was diagnosed, what exactly were Tommy's symptoms?
well, he had these sores in his mouth.
oral ulcers?
Yeah.
that's right.
I'm sorry, I just, um...
I can't think of anything else.
you know, ever since he died, my memory's not so great.
well, you've been extremely helpful.
I can hardly remember his voice anymore.
how can that be?
I... really should leave you to get back to your children.
that's okay, you don't have to rush off, it's okay.
I have a long drive.
thank you so much for your time.
him coming by meant a lot.
you know, showed me that someone cared.
have you heard from him since?
no, but you're saying that he's the one who gave me the money?
so why would he do that?
Heller's afraid that Exilair is what killed that boy.
well, I bet she's not the only he spoke to.
maybe one of the other parents wanted payback.
do you know who did this, Jim?
do you know who took Ethan?
no.
but you know what they want.
why are you protecting them?
just talk to me.
talk to the agents.
we need to get him back.
that's what I'm trying to do.
still not talking?
not even to his wife.
something's got him really scared.
you know, maybe it's Genacore.
the place where we picked him up is two blocks from the corporate offices, and it turns out he was there this morning.
have a seat.
we're all in shock over Jim's son being abducted.
if there's anything at all we can do.
you can start by telling me how much of the company's revenue is generated by the sales of Exilair.
I can't believe that you need a lawyer to help you answer that question.
well, I was told we were here to discuss Jim Heller's situation.
what is that, 85%, is that about right?
it's the first product out of our pipeline to win FDA approval.
we've been very fortunate.
I would say so;
you now have five pharmaceutical companies courting you.
Genacore is the hot new girl that everybody's chasing, but without Exilair... she can't give it away.
very colorful.
what's your point,
agent Malone?
if there were something wrong with the drug, it would derail a lot of plans, correct?
there is no problem with Exilair.
it's been on the market for almost a year, we've helped thousands of patients.
is that something that you discussed with Mr. Heller in your office this morning?
you don't have to respond, Michael.
we know that you had security remove him after an argument.
what was the argument about?
you don't have to answer that, either.
don't you find it interesting, Mr. Fletcher, that after his son is kidnapped, the first person that Heller speaks to is you.
why is that?
it's okay.
I've got nothing to hide.
I saw Jim.
he just showed up at headquarters, he was acting totally irrational.
Mike, wait!
Jim. What are you doing here?
I know I shouldn't have gone behind your back with the investigation.
what are you talking about, what investigation?
it'll never happen again.
I just want my son back.
please.
your son?
you're not making any sense.
why would I have your son?
no, no, Jim, Jim.
you need to pull yourself together.
I know... Just pull yourself together.
I know that you know where Ethan is!
get him off of me! Get him off of me!
you let them!
my boy!
why are you doing this to me?!
he's my little boy!
get off me!
I didn't hear the news about Jim's son till later on in the morning.
obviously, I feel terrible about it.
Heller thought that looking into Exilair was the reason his son was abducted.
that's absolutely absurd.
is it?
you're sitting here with your lawyer- obviously you knew he had concerns about the drug.
I knew nothing about the investigation.
Yes, he showed me some raw data.
about what, lung infections?
pneumocystis, yes.
and did you report it to the FDA?
of course.
and they agreed with a dozen Genacore researchers who reviewed the data:
it was inconclusive.
we followed regulations to the letter.
tell that to the kids who died, Mr. Fletcher.
look...
who stands to lose the most if something bad comes out about Exilair?
the children benefiting from it.
do you have stock?
we all do.
everyone who started with us received a generous equity package.
share prices go down, people lose a lot of money.
nobody's made a dime from the sale of that stock yet.
it hasn't vested.
when does it come due?
when does it vest, Mr. Fletcher? Answer the question.
in two days.
so Mack enhanced the video, and the backseat Ethan was in is from six possible cars.
what are those?
our agents found medical files stashed all over Jim's hotel room.
more kids who died from Exilair.
Yeah, I been talking to the families.
did Jim visit them?
Yeah.
after he left, another man showed up and asked one of the families a ton of questions.
don't suppose they got a name, huh?
no. But they're giving us a sketch.
anybody see the car he was driving? Yeah.
hang on.
okay, blue Oldsmobile, late '80s.
okay, 1987 Oldsmobile Cutlass.
it's on Mack's list.
let's put out an alert.
do you know who this is?
I don't know.
but you've seen him before, right?
and he saw you interviewing those families.
we also think he's the guy who roughed you up in the parking lot.
I don't know what you're talking about.
look, you had problems with Exilair.
somebody in the company thought you were going to go public, and they didn't want you trashing the stock before it had time to vest.
so they grabbed your kid and told you to sit tight and shut up for 48 hours.
look, we know everything.
so, whatever deal you made with them means absolutely nothing.
where does that leave my son?
in a much better place now that we're in the loop.
how the hell do you know?
look at this man.
he is a hired gun.
make no mistake, he will fulfill his contract, kill your son, and collect the money.
so why don't you tell us what the kidnappers told you.
just like you said.
I was supposed to keep quiet and they'd let Ethan go.
when did you first realize this drug wasn't safe?
about a year before the approval.
but the trial said that 99% of the kids on Exilair were actually helped by it, so I convinced myself the risks were worth it.
and what changed your mind?
couple of months back,
Stephanie and I took Ethan to the doctor.
he's had the fever and swelling how long?
five, maybe six days.
my hands are itchy.
then we'll just have to un-itch them.
Kristen, can you take Ethan to the play room?
we'll be right there, Sweetie.
what's wrong with him?
he's going to be fine.
the textbook name for his condition is "mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome,"
also known as Kawasaki's disease.
what is that, is it serious?
I won't lie to you. It certainly can be.
Oh, my God.
but...
with a course of intravenous gamma globulin, within a few weeks he'll be a good as new.
you're lucky.
before gamma globulin, there wasn't a lot we could do.
I, uh... I lost a little girl to it not long after I started practicing.
how safe is the treatment?
Oh, it's been around for 20 years.
you have nothing to worry about.
twenty years.
I knew Exilair didn't have that kind of track record, and it never would
yet people were depending on it.
they're trusting us with the lives of their children.
I couldn't look away anymore.
why didn't you tell your wife?
what was I going to say, that the drug I'd spent years working on was actually secretly killing kids?
I know what happens to whistle-blowers.
I wanted to protect my family, do it confidentially.
I was gathering information to send to the New York Times when they took Ethan.
did you talk to anyone, other than Michael Fletcher, about your concerns?
Nope.
that's why I became convinced that he had to be involved.
but now I don't know.
what am I supposed to do now?
talk to your wife.
officer spotted a blue Cutlass at a deli in the Bronx with a kid in the back, and the shoots were fired?
this our guy? Yeah, it looks that way.
I'm going to have to agree with you on this one.
excuse me. Give me a little space.
all right, let's clear out.
watch. Thank you.
yo. How you doing, man?
you okay to talk?
Yeah.
well, you want to tell us what happened?
I spotted the Cutlass, so I went to check it out.
that's when I saw the kid.
well, was the kid okay?
as far as I could tell.
right after- that's when it hit the fan.
sir, reach out with your right hand, lift the door handle and slowly step out of the vehicle.
all I could do was lie on my... and get the plate.
okay, now, there was only one other guy in the car?
you're absolutely sure?
Yeah.
can you describe him?
reddish hair...
average-looking.
average-looking.
I'm sorry. It just happened so fast.
it's all right. It's all right.
you take care, okay?
Thanks.
Taylor.
you got something?
all right, thanks.
all right, so, the Cutlass is registered to a Scott Matthews.
you're looking at him.
no, I'm not looking for him.
I'm looking for information on him.
well, do you know who any of his friends are?
well, maybe he hung around with other people in the building.
okay, was that his first job after he left the Marines?
I'm going to need a list of employees going back about 10 years.
no, no, not tomorrow- right now.
listen, lady, I could be doing other things, too.
I need it now.
what part of "now" do you not understand?
he was a security guard?
Uh-huh.
and the company he worked for was WeimerTech.
can you tell me what year that was?
got it. Thanks.
I just found out who Scott Matthews used to work with at WeimerTech.
Yeah, I worked there.
what happened to that company, Mr. Carter?
you know, what happened to a lot of start-ups
didn't work out.
is that where you met Scott Matthews?
I don't think I remember anyone named, what, Scott Matthews?
you are going to spill your guts in here one way or the other.
now, do you want to cooperate with me or not?
no?
okay. Fine.
Yeah.
clear the floor.
what?
Mr. Carter, you don't know, because you can't see through that window, but right now, every single agent out there is clearing the floor so they can't see what's about to happen in here.
it's like, uh,"if a tree falls in the forest" kind of thing.
I should get a lawyer.
go ahead.
let's see if you can make it to the door.
now, where's the boy?
I don't know.
you had him kidnapped.
you own 80, 000 shares of Genacore, and Jim Heller was about to flush it down the toilet.
am I correct?
he was going to ruin everything.
look...
Exilair- it is a good drug.
it's just that...
some anomalies showed up in the data.
is that your way of saying that kids were dying?
very few compared to how many were being helped.
so I...
I reclassified them in the analysis for the FDA.
look, dozens of people reviewed those numbers, and no one noticed a problem.
Jim Heller did.
he was rechecking the data.
he have any idea what you were up to?
no one did.
no one wants to know.
so you think that makes it okay.
that's not what I'm saying here.
Yes, it is, 'cause 100 people turn their heads the other way, and no one is to blame.
now, who is Scott Matthews' partner?
I honestly don't know.
they were in the Bronx heading south.
where are they going?
I was supposed to meet them at the West Side docks at 50th Street at 8: 30.
with the boy?
I was going to let him go, I swear.
I didn't want anybody to get hurt.
it's a little late for that, Mr. Carter.
I got Ethan.
I don't see the perp.
he's still here.
there's no way he left that kid without the cash.
you know, I don't care.
we can't just leave him standing out there like that.
Martin, listen to me.
we're going to stick to the book, all right?
backup's on its way.
it'll be safer for the kid. You know what?
we don't have time to wait for backup.
what if he shoots him while he's standing out there, huh?
what if he shoots him?
we're waiting for backup, all right?
no, we're not going to wait. You just cover me.
what are you doing?
Hey, Ethan.
Hey! Hey!
Martin, get the kid.
Martin, get the kid!
Yeah, okay.
come here.
it's okay. It's okay.
it's okay. It's okay.
my name is Martin.
I'm a policeman. You're safe now.
I'm going to go home now.
good night.
night.
Whoops. Oh, hey, Jack.
Hey, how you doing?
I heard that things went to crap pretty fast out there.
Yeah, yeah, they did.
listen, um...
don't worry about the paperwork tonight.
you can do it in the morning.
okay, cool. All right, good night.
good night.
Hey, uh...
I need to talk to you for a second.
Yeah, well, I need to talk to you, too.
all right.
you almost got that kid killed today.
I know.
I'm sorry; I made a bad call.
what is it?
what's what?
what is it? Is it... is it painkillers?
what are you talking about?
I already told you I wasn't feeling well.
I know what an addict looks like.
Yeah, but you got it all wrong.
Yeah, I must have it all wrong.
Martin, look at me.
you have a problem.
all right?
you have to get yourself straight, and you have to do it before you put any of our people in danger.
no, I would never do that.
you're already doing it.
excuse me.
I mean, a man and his bike, defying death to live another day.
hey
any luck finding your stuff?
thank you so much for the bike.
no worries.
I asked all around the Belvedere.
no one remembers seeing my bike locked up, let alone who took it.
I think he might know.
am I interrupting something?
no, we were just finishing up.
good. Got one more for the road. Do you want it?
Yeah, definitely.
Hey, yo. You sure you want to do that, Lou?
I mean, Brandon here, he's a damn slow rider.
even slower on foot.
ain't that right?
Where's your bike?
it's in the shop.
rush hour traffic, running would be faster.
Yeah, nice try, newbie.
come on, Lou.
fly like the wind.
hello.
what are you still doing at home?
you were supposed to be here a half hour ago.
what? Oh, crap.
I overslept. I'm sorry.
what have I told you about staying out late on school nights?
what's up?
we got a bike messenger on the West Side.
Brandon Parker, 18.
went out on a run two nights ago made his delivery. no one's seen him since.
and who called it in?
someone down at the dispatch office.
you know, NYPD busted a few of these guys for running drugs.
we're thinking maybe it could be related.
so, Danny and I are gonna... we're gonna head down there.
why don't you meet us there when you're done waking up?
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm on my way.
Brandon seemed pretty rattled when he left the other night, so I figured, "No biggie, he forgot to check in after his run.
does he normally call in?
he checks with the dispatcher for his schedule the next day.
when he's a no-show two days in a row, and no call, either...
so you tried to, uh, contact him?
Yeah, on his work cell. Only number I had.
went straight to voicemail.
um, do you know if Brandon has any family in the area?
he didn't talk about them if he did.
well, maybe he just bailed.
I hear you guys have a pretty high turnover here.
like a revolving door.
but Brandon said that he really needed this job.
okay, what about the other messengers? Anything illegal been going on?
define illegal.
okay. Running drugs last year?
I don't know about the rest of them, but not Brandon
he kept clean.
did Brandon have any problems with any of the other messengers?
there's this one guy, Zach.
Brandon thought he might have stolen his bike.
is Zach here today?
actually, he's not.
according to his friends, he got into some kind of accident yesterday.
he had to spend the night at St. Andrews Hospital.
Yeah, doc says it's a fractured ulna.
my sympathies.
sorry. Crosstown traffic.
yo, I seriously hope you asked the doctor before yanking me out of recovery.
otherwise, even Uncle Sam can't save you from a lawsuit.
this police report says that you were riding Brandon Parker's bike when you met that Volvo face-first.
ulna. I hit my ulna.
and that driver ran a red light.
he'll be hearing from my lawyer, too.
Where'd you get the bike?
found it.
did you find his wallet and his cell phone, too?
hmm?
because the admitting nurse said she found these in your shoulder bag.
is that what she said? - Yeah, she did.
look, I admit, I took his wheels, all right?
as a joke.
but all that stuff, it was in a pouch on his handlebars.
so you're just holding it for him till he comes back?
Yeah, something like that.
Hey, Zach.
we know you had a problem with Brandon, okay?
now he's missing and you show up with his personal effects.
let me tell you something.
you're the definition of a suspect, my friend.
you don't seriously think I laid a hand on him?
you all tripping, yo.
in fact, you got it backwards.
running to do the delivery.
how weak is that, yo?
yo, I'm talking to you.
I want my bike back.
I want my bike back.
what if I said I didn't take your bike?
what if I kicked your ass?
well then you'd be going home crying to Mommy.
man, what the hell's going on?
doesn't matter, man. Let's get out of here.
Oh, what, you man enough to hit somebody, but you can't stay around?
get off me.
that's right, punk. You better run!
if that guy hadn't shown, Brandon'd be on the ground no time flat.
you ever see the guy in the Camaro before?
Nope.
think you could describe him to sketch artist?
for you...
I can do just about anything.
6: 30 PM, Picked up by camaro man
and voil?
your messenger scratched off the original photo, dropped in his own and did a pretty lousy job laminating it.
it's a lot of work for a bad fake.
Hey, easy, that's a camera.
Really?
you know, I used to sideline these in high school making them for buddies.
it's a lot harder now with digital technology.
did you put that on your FBI application?
don't ask, don't tell.
all right, guys, meet your real Brandon Parker.
that's great. Good work.
Thanks.
that's, uh, not a camera.
I knew that.
he's been using your son's ID, Mrs. Parker.
do you recognize him?
his name is Matt.
he used to play basketball in a YMCA league with Brandon.
do you have a last name?
no. I might still have a team roster, though.
poor boy.
his parents must be worried sick.
did you ever see them at any of the games or picking him up after practice?
I don't think so. No. Sorry.
here it is.
Yeah. Matt Jameson.
he dropped out early in the season.
a lot of these kids fall behind in school.
can I see this? Thank you.
I'm gonna go call it in.
okay.
we're gonna need to talk to your son, if you don't mind.
just ask a few questions.
of course, but Brandon's with his father checking out the campus at Penn, has been all week.
when was the last time you saw Matt?
couple of months ago.
he showed up at a playoff game, just to watch.
we had a little party here afterwards.
I felt bad for him, so I invited him over.
hey there.
why don't you grab a soda from the fridge?
Thanks.
this is insane.
what is this, a month's worth of food?
try a week.
barely that, with teenagers eating me out of house and home.
bread crumbs.
you just mix a few in with the beef.
it goes a lot farther and nobody can taste the difference.
a little trick from my mom.
she sounds like an industrious lady.
listen, if, uh... if you want me to help, I can.
I know my way around the kitchen.
all right.
why don't you wash up?
I could use the help.
what happened to your arm?
Oh, that?
that's what happens when you go diving for a loose ball and catch the bleachers instead.
it's pretty ugly. I don't recommend it.
something about his story... didn't seem right.
but I just let it go.
excuse me.
so I tracked down the apartment.
landlord says they moved out the middle of last year.
that can't be right.
the list's just a few months old.
a lot can happen in a few months.
social services file on Matt Jameson.
let's see...
okay, born October 1990.
that makes him 15, not 18 like he told the messenger company.
you have a current address?
no, but he is in the system.
he spent a year in foster care when he was four years old.
his mother, Nadine Jameson, had a problem with crystal meth.
but there's no father recorded on the birth certificate.
looks like the kid didn't fare any better with his foster dad.
multiple allegations of child abuse.
Yeah, well the mother eventually got clean and got him back.
Hey, guys, I got something.
an electric bill in Nadine Jameson's name.
dated last month.
address is in Harlem near 135th.
no wonder he gave a fake address.
ms. Jameson?
it's the FBI.
we need to talk to you. Please open the door.
Hi.
who are you?
uh, I'm Samantha. This is Martin.
we're with the FBI.
which is kind of like the police.
is Matt here?
no.
what about your mom? Is she at home?
it's okay. You can tell us.
she doesn't live here anymore.
what about your dad?
he died last year.
okay, so who's watching over you guys?
all right, keep the change.
when was the last time you talked to Matt?
a couple days ago.
I'm not supposed to call him at work except in emergencies.
but I didn't know what to do.
about what?
our building manager came by to drop this off for my mom.
Matt made me read it to him over the phone.
here you go.
it's a three-day eviction notice.
