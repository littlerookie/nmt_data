hizballah accuses israel of killing hariri, arguing that only the jewish state stood to benefit from the assassination.
hizballah may have a stockpile of new rockets, but israeli generals hope gaza will serve as a cautionary example of what would happen if it used them.
hizballah prioritizes the struggle against israel and insists it has no desire to rule over all of lebanon.
hizballah's leader, sheik hassan nasrallah, dismissed the indictments as groundless and accused israel and the u. s. of manipulating the tribunal to pave the way for "sectarian strife and civil war."
hizbollah, funded and directed by the iranians, has rebuilt its stocks of missiles.
hizbullah being what it is, mr nasrallah lost no time claiming that this was "a strategic, historic victory"; crowds in tehran chorused that israel had been "destroyed."
hizbullah being what it is, mr nasrallah lost no time claiming that this was "a strategic, historic victory"; crowds in tehran chorused that israel had been "destroyed."
hizbullah claims the loyalty of most of lebanon's shias, who make up around a third of the population.
hizbullah could now face a challenge to its hegemony in the south of the country.
hizbullah has not endeared itself to many governments in the region, syria and iran apart.
hizbullah leaders followed this staged provocation with denunciations of the un's supposed affront to the virtue of lebanese womanhood, declaring that henceforth any co-operation with the tribunal would be equated to collaboration with the "zionist enemy."
hizbullah needs to be given a way to consent to these changes without losing face.

hizbullah rouses region-wide cheers for bloodying israel's nose.
hizbullah's defiant presence on the border, its pale yellow flags fluttering in sight of israeli posts, have undoubtedly rankled with the army and public.
hizbullah's exulting leader, sheikh hassan nasrallah, went on television to taunt mr olmert. Hizbullah did not seek escalation, he said, but if israel chose confrontation, "we are ready."

hizbullah's timing is no accident.
hizbullah, the iran-backed shia militia in lebanon, is one of the world's great repositories of "management secrets," writes joshua cooper ramo in his new book, "the age of the unthinkable."
