when you kissed me, I felt such a rush. Didn't you feel it?
my heart says there's still something there.
as much as I want us to be together, we can't.
my Mom's changed our plans.
Josh doesn't know?
this is our last night together.
stop. No heartfelt goodbyes.
tonight is about you and me.
you're going straight to bed.
who are you? - Michael Cassidy.
they put pressure on me to bring you in.
they want their greatest achievement on their side.
why the interest in Cassidy? - I don't like him.
the guy creeps me out.
you know what I would like to hear about? My mother.
I think it's beholding upon me to tell you what sort of person you have living under your roof.
after the explosion, she came across a man camping.
and she killed him. - Oh, my God.
it's in her nature.
Jessi? - He murdered my mother.
she knew I was Latnok.
she was gonna kill me.
Baylin's experiment... we're starting it up again.
Sarah found out.
I'm already a murder!
No!
how did it go at the Rack?
just like we wanted.
Kyle's still out there with Cassidy.
Kyle can handle him.
you saved my life. I will take care of this.
do you trust me?
I do.
ruse. Charade.
deception.
no matter how you define the words, they begin and end with a lie.
here you go, mate.
my mum always said tea was medicine for the soul.
how are you feeling?
how should I feel?
it's going to take some going through.
you've been through a lot tonight.
what are you going to tell everyone else at Latnok?
this group here don't need to know anything other than what you're gonna tell your family about Jessi running away.
but the senior members, they know.
you told them already?
it's my job, mate.
got to keep them up to speed.
do they not even care that Jessi's dead?
you have to understand. You're their guy.
you always have been.
come on. I want to show you something.
was this mine?
the one and only. Took a little maneuvering to rebuild it after the explosion at Zzyzx, but that's why our young geniuses come in so handy.
they rebuilt this? - Not exactly.
they built it in pieces.
mark's algorithms.
Nate's hoverboard magnets.
everyone contributed something.
you tricked them.
their inventions had practical applications. That's all they need to know.
what did I give you?
I'm sure you can figure it out.
the growth accelerant that Nate and I developed.
helps with muscle growth.
why didn't you just tell me this is what you were doing when you brought me in?
how would you have felt about that?
if Zzyzx had their way, I would have spent my entire life in this pod as some type of bio-computer.
that's not the kind of technology you want falling into the wrong hands.
there's your answer.
they knew you wouldn't approve.
they were right.
but you don't really have a choice in the matter, do you?
unless you want everyone you know to know the truth about what you did to Jessi.
is that what this is?
more blackmail?
I like to think of it as self-preservation.
we gonna have a problem with that?
no.
look, in a couple of days, Latnok are gonna have a warehouse full of specimens in gestation to keep them occupied.
they already have everything they need?
I have everything they need.
I give it to them...
they leave you alone.
consider this freedom my gift to you.
my lies had brought me an offer of freedom.
but now Adam's misguided experiment was in the hands of a blackmailer...a murder.
I knew I wouldn't truly be free until I stopped him.
thank God. - Are you okay?
it worked. I got him to tell me everything.
what did he say?
I'll explain it all, I promise.
but I need to see Jessi.
I need to know that she's okay.
Kyle. I'm okay.
um, your arms are growing.
they are?
Yeah. They're at least a half-centimeter bigger in circumference.
have you increased your exercise regimen?
maybe a little.
your um... your pectoral muscles are also expanding.
what?
your hand... feels nice.
does this one, too?
Yes.
did you just shock me?
no. Why would I shock you?
I don't know. I felt a charge go through my body.
that's your libido.
what?
no it isn't.
I would have felt that before.
you never felt a charge with Amanda?
I felt other things.
well, maybe there was a power surge in the area.
maybe.
so, how did you sleep last night?
I didn't.
neither did I.
I'm sorry you had to go through that.
I'm sure it wasn't easy confronting Cassidy about Sarah.
I was acting.
I'm fine. I promise.
there's that power surge again.
Josh is still asleep, but I talked to Lori about what's going on.
I'll finish getting dressed and be right out.
I'll be in the other room, pretending to be dead.
I'm not happy about this.
I'm sorry. Jessi came in, and things got weird.
it won't happen again.
not that. Well, yes, that.
but more importantly, I don't like this game you guys are playing with Cassidy.
it's dangerous.
I don't like it either.
Kyle, I've given you a lot of leeway in the past, but this just feels different.
there's something about it.
something about Cassidy...
he scares me.
I'm going to take care of it. I promise.
I need it to be over.
we can't keep doing this to our family.
hide and seek with parents downstairs is not cool.
straight to voice mail? Not cool.
leaving without saying goodbye? Even less cool.
what's wrong with you?
call me back.
can anyone help me figure out how to throttle my girlfriend long-distance?
why long-distance?
because she left. Vamoosed.
hitched a ride on the a-train to Cleveland.
she didn't even have the courage to tell me in person.
she left this on my pillow.
on your pillow?
uhhh, ask Dad.
Oh, I will.
mom?
are you OK?
you know what? Yeah.
if she's just gonna up and leave like that, forget her.
I'm fine. Dandy.
she was probably afraid to say goodbye.
then she's a coward. Good riddance.
Josh, I'm sorry. But there's something else we need to talk about...
here's what I have so far.
leave it open.
well, um...
in order to fill, say, 100 pods, Cassidy would need at least 5, 000 gallons of formula on hand.
not to mention the space he'd need to house the pods.
I ran a search, and there are over 5300 warehouses in Seattle that are big enough.
the formula would have to be kept at a certain temperature in order to sustain its nutritional elements...
probably a few degrees below body temperature.
that's a way to narrow it down.
we can access the city police's thermal imaging scans, like how they find the people growing the weed.
the weed?
Yeah. The blaze.
the herb. The chronic.
where did you pick that up? - Cable.
once we find where they're hiding the formula, we need to sabotage it so that it doesn't work.
and destroy any way of re-creating it.
what about the pods? How do we destroy them?
we won't need to. Without the formula, they're useless.
Amanda? - Where?
I hear her heartbeat.
you're still listening for her heartbeat?
it comes naturally now.
she's coming to the window.
you've gotta go. She can't see you.
you're supposed to be missing.
Hi. - I'm sorry, I know this is weird, but I really need to talk to you and I don't want anyone else to know about it.
what happened?
here, come in.
I think you were right about Nate.
what did he do?
I found all this odd research in his dorm room.
you were in his dorm room?
I saw the number from the Ouija board.
when you asked what your birthday was?
781227. - There were drawings of these chambers that could carry a baby without a birth mother. Or an umbilical cord.
your father's name, Adam Baylin, was everywhere.
I know you have secrets, and I try not to pry, but Kyle, it's like he was studying your life.
Amanda, does he know you saw all of this?
you said there were people who would use those you care about to get to you.
is he one of them?
I think he might be.
I always do this.
why do I always get involved with the lying, cheating jerks?
I'm sorry.
Amanda, I need you to stay away from him.
I can't guarantee it's safe to be around him.
what?
it's you. The Charlies, the Nates of this world...
those are the real jerks.
you, no matter what, are one of the good guys.
I always knew you were.
even when I thought I didn't.
I try to be. - You are.
kissing Amanda, I felt a rolling flutter deep inside.
I'd heard the term before: 'butterflies.'
how was it possible to feel electricity for one person and butterflies for another?
I think Cassidy has Adam's data edsolatethe university.
I saw the system last night.
if I can get back in there,
I can swap it out with a dummy drive and figure out if he made any back-ups.
I need to get rid of all of them.
don't you think Cassidy would be watching you closely?
I'll need some sort of distraction.
you can't go. You're dead.
I know, and dead girls get stuck in the house doing thermal scans of Seattle's industrial district.
I almost hate to suggest it, but what about Mark?
we don't know if we can fully trust him yet.
I do.
I mean, based on my little recon mission last night, we know he's no fan of Cassidy's.
and I know it's not my life we're talking about, but your secret is my secret, too.
it's all of ours.
do we have to spend the rest of our lives not ever letting anyone else in?
this situation is too extreme, Lori.
no matter how much you care about him.
the problem is, we don't have anyone else who has an excuse to be in Latnok.
that's not entirely true.
what is this, Bring Your Mother to Work Day?
Mrs. Trager?
I'm sorry, Michael. I hate to bother you like this, but can I speak to you? It's about last night.
I know I wasn't the best dinner guest, but I didn't think my behavior warranted a house call.
no, it's Jessi. She never came home.
Oh. I see. I'm sorry. Come in.
Thanks.
so, she wasn't at her apartment?
first place I checked.
I don't know why I thought she might come here, especially after your confrontation.
but, I didn't know where else to look.
Yeah, I'm sorry. This is my fault.
please, no.
it's not the first time she's run away, unfortunately...
where did she go the last time?
the woods... It's a long story, and yes, we've already looked.
she's had a rough go of it.
you used to counsel her, didn't you?
is there a problem?
no, not at all... It's just a bit of a sore subject.
I received a warning for taking her in.
I almost lost my license.
well, she was very lucky to have had you helping her.
thank you.
it's nice to feel appreciated.
you've done an amazing job with Kyle.
I know you mean a lot to him.
he means a lot to us.
are you cleaning?
in a manner of speaking, yes.
I am cleaning my life.
I have too many things that remind me of Andy.
I am purging...
and please don't touch anything.
it's all exactly where I want it.
staphylococcus aureus.
no. That is in fact a cup.
inside the cup. The bacteria.
how long has this been here?
could be this morning...Could be last month...
your room is the perfect environment for it to grow.
it's warm, dark, and a little...
manly? - Dank.
why am I letting you stand in my room and insult me?
because your dankness... - Manliness.
just gave me an idea of how to disable the formula.
I needed to burn Adam's journals to erase his records of the experiment.
but I knew I was also burning the only real connection
I had to the man who had given me life.
and the way he had given it.
thank you for earlier.
I'm just glad it's over.
according to the hard drive, he made a single backup of data.
I think I saw the disc in his safe when I found Sarah's ring.
he'll have moved it by now. Maybe to his apartment.
now you're breaking into his apartment?
if I don't destroy every trace of this formula, he'll just re-create it.
I have to make sure that doesn't happen.
I can't help wishing you'd just taken him up on his offer of freedom.
Nicole... they're re-starting the experiment.
they're playing God!
and if Cassidy is any indication of the kind of people they are,
I don't want them to have that power.
I understand.
I do. But the deeper in you get, the more it's changing you.
changing me?
you fake Jessi's death.
you're lying, you're sneaking around, breaking laws...
this just isn't you.
at least it's not who you used to be.
thanks for coming with me.
are you kidding?
being your lookout, breaking into someone's apartment...
it's like the old days. I'd be pissed if you hadn't asked me.
this is it.
I have the keys to Jessi's apartment.
we'll go in there, climb through the air-conditioning ducts, and then drop down into Cassidy's.
or, I could just pick the lock.
don't ask.
isn't that breaking and entering?
it was OK when you were just entering?
let's see what we find.
Cassidy's passport and birth certificate.
in case of a quick getaway, I guess.
he's not using his real name.
it says Michael Cassidy Kingsley.
mother, Grace. Father, unknown.
grace Kingsley. Why does that name sound familiar?
grace Kingsley was in Adam's notebooks.
she's a member of Latnok.
Hey, hey, easy, killer. It's just a game.
it's not just a game.
it's our game. Mine and Andy's.
I thought making things explode would make me feel better, but it only reminded me of how much this sucks.
it does suck. Believe me, I know.
Lori didn't move thousands of miles away while you were still both in love and leave you without saying goodbye.
all she did was reject your sorry ass.
I have an idea.
death by porn?
just give me a few minutes. I have to make a call.
if his mother knew Adam, then she must have known Sarah.
I wonder if she knows her son is a killer.
this is everything on the disk.
that's the formula for the fluid.
you found it.
it worked.
what did?
the thermal imaging.
that facility is storing a large amount of something at the temperature we were tracking.
let's assume we're right, and the existing formula is there.
I'll go, add your bacteria to the fluid, then get out before anyone knows I was there.
I wish I could go with you.
I do, too.
we should see what else is on the disk before we destroy it.
the pod schematics.
step one. Genome insertion.
step two. Clone development.
clone? I thought they used human embryos.
that's the way it's always been done.
they must be using someone's genetic sequence to create a clone.
781227. - That's impossible.
Latnok isn't planning to gestate babies in those pods.
they're making clones... of me.
you've got to be kidding me.
is that even possible?
it never was before.
now with the pods and the formula, the development process is a more regulated environment.
I can't even wrap my head around the breach of scientific ethics.
it's even worse than just cloning.
Jessi and I were in gestation for sixteen years.
that's what allowed our brains to develop the way they did.
without all that time, we'd be just like everyone else.
so in order for them to create more children like you...
they would have to be in the pods for years.
but why just you? Why not both of you?
they think I'm damaged.
I think we've already established how wrong they are.
still, Kyle is special.
it's understandable they would want more like him.
if I'm special, it's not because of how I came into this world.
it's what happened to me once I was in it.
you took me in.
you loved me like I was one of your own children.
having you in my life... that's what makes me special.
but this, what they're planning, it's robbing someone of their childhood...
their connection to a mother...a family.
I can't allow that.
which is why we have to make sure it doesn't happen.
is that mold?
no. Mold is a fungus.
this is a bacterial agent that will compound exponentially when introduced into a live organism.
it'll basically suffocate any nutritional elements growing in the formula so it won't allow anything to grow.
of course it will.
I have to get going.
Kyle. Just...Be careful. Please.
I'll be home soon.
are you sure you don't need back-up?
we can't risk anyone seeing you until this is all over.
when it is over, what happens with your life?
what do you mean?
we'll destroy the experiment.
and then we can focus on Cassidy.
but one day soon, if we're successful, your life will just return to normal.
I'm starting to realize my life can never be normal.
but it would be nice to get back to some type of constant.
does constant mean Amanda?
I don't know what it means.
sorry, Jessi. I wish I did.
I wish I could understand how I could have feelings for more than one person.
you're saying you have feelings for me?
why would you even have to ask that?
what are you looking for? - Nicole.
Why?
good luck.
what happened?
the lamp blew out. I'll fix it.
I rock.
why do you rock?
and why aren't we making me feel any better yet?
Oh. Maybe this will.
Hi.
Jackie told me how to hijack the car's navigational system and walk Andy through linking up a video camera.
so even though she's on the road in the middle of the country, you get to see your girlfriend.
don't understand that at all, but... thanks, man.
really.
you're welcome.
where are you?
some rest stop in North Dakota.
Declan totally hacked into our minivan's GPS.
you're lucky we have one.
your moms are lesbians. How could they not?
are they, uh, listening to me right now?
lucky for you, they took my brothers in to pee.
good, because you are in big trouble, young missy.
I know. I totally suck.
you totally do.
how could you not say goodbye?
I chickened out.
I couldn't say goodbye to you.
I still can't.
well, then it doesn't have to be goodbye.
it can be hello with a lot of miles between us.
in that case, hello.
Hi.
you know what?
we can say hello every day until I get to see you again.
and then every day after that.
this should only take about 20 minutes.
just need to cable the system and run a quick diagnostic.
no problem.
I imagine you're not dropping off another lasagna.
I'll come back later. - Sorry. But you can't leave.
Why? - Because you've seen me.
not following. - I'm supposed to be missing and if you tell your new boyfriend that I'm not, you'll ruin everything.
he's not my boyfriend.
he's not anything anymore.
I told Kyle I'd stay away from him, but he still has all that stuff about him in his dorm room.
why didn't you just take it?
I don't know. Because that would be stealing.
but Nate stole it in the first place.
I guess it just didn't occur to me, all right?
I'm not as smart as you.
that's true.
I just came to say that Nate's working until ten tonight, so if Kyle wants to get into the room, he can.
Kyle's not home.
then you do it.
I can't go anywhere.
you still haven't explained that.
and I don't plan on it.
look, unfortunately, you're gonna have to do it.
do what? Break into his room and steal his files?
I was thinking firebomb, but okay.
almost done. It's just...
you don't have to watch.
unless you just like... lurking.
can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
I'm going to ghost his system.
so, basically it'll be like I'm sitting right where you are.
less chance for operator error.
OK. Open up the systems file.
I need you to get his IP address.
if you know... - I know what that is.
save the sarcasm.
type it into the "share host" box down at the bottom.
and change all the settings to "allow.
perfect.
Wow. There's a lot of stuff here Nate's been collecting.
about Kyle?
see for yourself.
I've wanted to know his secrets for so long...
here it all is.
Yeah, well take a good look.
no. When he's ready to tell me, then it'll mean something.
for now, this is just weird.
always the good girl.
not all of us can be as wild as you, Jessi.
apparently, you can.
Amanda, what's wrong?
this is Cassidy.
I caught Kyle's girlfriends going through my stuff.
girlfriends?
Amanda and Jessi.
Jessi. That's impossible.
she's... missing.
well, if she was, she isn't anymore.
find out what they know.
shut it down. Mr. Cassidy wants everyone out of here.
I haven't finished yet.
we have orders.
we need to check the perimeter.
what are you doing?
what is this?
a bacteria.
a bacteria? Why would you...
listen, Mark. We don't have much time.
do you have any idea what you've been helping Cassidy do?
computerized in-vitro gestational chambers.
for women who can't give birth naturally.
I wish that's what it was.
what are you talking about?
just know that Cassidy has been using you.
Latnok is not what they say they are. And that I need your help.
I need you to trust me. Please.
I'll distract them.
just do what you need to do and get out.
Hello?
you're very anxious, for someone who's looking for a dead girl.
I told you, I didn't see anything.
I wish I could believe that. I really do.
why did you do that?
I thought you could use the help.
we have to get the files and get moving.
he's not gonna be out for very long.
why not? - Because you don't hit hard enough.
better?
where are they?
what did you do?
relax. They're on their way to the Rack.
to meet you, actually.
I may not be a genius, but I know how to clone a cell phone.
speaking of, you've put me in quite a bind with your little tricks.
Latnok's gonna think I failed them.
failed them? Or failed her?
what? - You know what I'm talking about.
so you found out about my mum.
you know, if she had her way, you wouldn't still be living this life of yours.
Latnok would have complete control over you, and believe me, it's only a matter of time before she figures out how to get what she wants.
I was going to convince her to let you go.
all because I thought you saved my life.
who knew what a clever little liar you would be?
I had no choice. - We all have choices.
like how I am choosing to forgive you for what you've done and give you a chance to fix it.
then no one need be any the wiser.
even if I knew how to do that, I wouldn't.
Oh, you know. It's all up there in that head of yours.
forgot about that, didn't you?
I can think of a few people who probably haven't.
but they went about it the wrong way in the past.
anyone with a brain knows there's only one way to get you to cooperate.
you figured out what I did to get rid of Sarah.
so you know what I'm willing to do to get what I want.
no.
we're OK. Nate's still out cold.
that ring... looks a lot like the one Kyle wears around his neck.
Nate stole it from Cassidy.
it belonged to my mother.
so I guess you kind of helped me find it.
and you saved me, so...
I guess we're even?
look, I know we've never really gotten along, but...I don't know.
I feel like we might be a little bit closer than before.
so I think it's only fair that I tell you...
tell me what?
I'm going to tell Kyle I want him back.
you really have the nerve to say that?
after everything that happened tonight?
like I said, fair warning.
you deserve it.
you're a lot braver than I thought.
Origin...? - What is it?
I don't believe it.
you still wear Adam's Latnok ring.
how awfully sentimental.
and lucky for me.
why are you doing this?
because that is what they want.
that's what she wants.
and if you try to stop me, I'm just gonna have to keep hurting you.
then, I'm gonna hurt Jessi until she wishes she had really died.
and then, just when you think it couldn't get any worse, I'll hurt everybody that ever mattered to you.
starting with Amanda.
how you feelin' about that, mate?
Nicole had been right when she said she didn't recognize the person I had become.
the person I had been before would have never done this...
you won't do it.
what makes you so sure?
because Grace Kingsley, my mother...
what about her?
she's your mother, too.
I'm your brother.
I'm Adam Baylin.
what do you want from me?
what would you like to know?
everything.
are they your family?
they were killed by a drunk driver.
you were the drunk driver.
she thinks that she's my sister.
I'm just supposed to live that lie?
she's the computer, and her life is the program.
I'm...Declan, by the way.
usually, that would be where you'd say your name.
I wanna break up. - I doesn't matter anyway. I've already erased you.
you and me? Done.
never happened.
what is this?
it's your new car.
it doesn't run right now, but we're gonna fix it up.
Kyle just read the manual.
since my dad died, we've been having money troubles.
I have a job interview.
what's the job?
welcome to Madacorp.
I can't wait to be part of the team.
I'm gonna stay here and see if I can help.
why would you do that?
you think I'm just gonna walk away from you now?
people live much of their lives in uncertainty.
what might happen in a week...
a month...
a year.
I wondered about my own life, if I would be able to answer the questions that kept appearing.
I guess, I, too, was looking for certainty.
it's a done deal.
I'm scoring Dava Avina.
she looks nice.
kittens are nice.
Diva's...
well, hopefully she's not nice.
I thought you two were just study partners for biology lab.
it may have started there, but I knew we were destined for more.
you see, Kyle, women are attracted to success.
they can't resist it.
and in high school, success means...a car.
boys, life is not like a rap video.
having a pimped out car doesn't guarantee your hand gets anywhere near her bra.
if she wears one.
what is with boys and breasts?
don't side with her, buddy.
you're breaking a sacred bond.
I'm Andy. - Kyle.
I'm in the middle of teaching Kyle about life and love.
then I am thwarting a great injustice.
let me set you straight on what girls actually like.
I want you to remember this moment.
remember this moment.
the words triggered something, and suddenly...
I saw things that shouldn't have been there.
a fishbowl.
a postcard.
and the urn that contained Adam Baylin's ashes.
Kyle, you okay, dude?
Kyle, you all right?
I feel like something bad is about to happen.
I got two words for you...
lottery ticket.
Hey, you guys okay?
awesome.
our little alien can predict the future.
you should see the rack.
it's not the place I would call earthquake friendly.
then what are you doing home?
checking out my ride for damage.
you should check your room.
it looks like it was hit pretty hard.
no, it was like that before.
did Josh think you predicted the earthquake?
I had a feeling something bad was gonna happen.
and then everything started shaking.
you know, certain animals seem to anticipate natural disasters.
it's not out of the realm of scientific possibility.
is there something else?
I saw some things.
what things?
things that were there...
and then weren't.
like I was dreaming, except I was awake.
sounds like you had some sort of vision.
a vision.
is that normal?
I think we need to expand our definition of normal when it comes to you.
I need the right shirt for tomorrow.
you're choosing already?
it's my first big day.
well, you want confident, but not overbearing.
thank you.
you're welcome.
I like the green.
it's perfect for the brilliant new guy in the software division.
right.
look, I know I've been stressed out looking for work.
things have been a little shaky lately.
I've been a little shaky myself.
and for a lot longer than you.
I think I can cut you some slack.
Yeah, well...I think the future's looking up for me.
we're gonna be just fine.
you're totally screwed.
you're exaggerating.
you couldn't be more screwed if you were between a wall and a Phillips head.
I'm golden.
I shoot from the hip.
girls like spontaneity in a man.
girls like a plan.
spontaneity is code for "I couldn't be bothered. "
okay.
then what about bowling?
or...
we could look for something that doesn't scream "seventh grader."
next.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
what?
for the good of our species, I'll help you plan your first date.
look, you said I've been kissed before.
Yes, I have.
many times.
maybe this isn't the best idea for you.
how can you watch that?
let's not think about that.
I like it.
my heart pounds like a drum when you're near.
I can feel it.
take me away from here...to a place where we...
remember your appointment today.
you have a session this afternoon.
all right. I'll be there.
then kiss me.
don't make me ask again.
I don't know how else to explain it.
predict the future.
I know it sounds weird.
who knows what you can do?
we should-- we should check Baylin's notes and see if he documented anything about this.
all right.
that phrase that you solved,"viz allati"?
it's Hungarian. It means "underwater."
you looked it up?
no, I just know it.
since when could you speak Hungarian?
Lori, here.
that was for you.
open mic night?
I just started playing.
I've heard you. You're good.
how do you know?
I live next door to you, remember?
I hear everything that comes out of your bedroom.
awesome.
take it from someone who knows a thing or two about getting their heart torn out and stomped on.
you need to vent.
I'm serious about Open ic night.
singing about your heartache could be very therapeutic.
technology.
science.

only one company integrates all three for the benefit of mankind.
ground-breaking research for tomorrow's solutions.

only one company integrates all three.
for the benefit of mankind.
my mom's been working really hard, but...
we still had to make some sacrifices.
the car and the piano were mine.
you two are in it together.
which is nice, but...
it would be nicer if I knew things were gonna get better soon.
it will.
you know that for a fact?
do you think it's possible somebody could?
it would be cool, wouldn't it?
if I knew everything was gonna turn out okay, I could deal with the bad.
it's not knowing that drives you crazy.
so predicting the future could be a good thing.
sure.
I mean, I guess you'd never be surprised.
and, believe me, lately surprises aren't all their cracked up to be.
there you go.
anything for the Tragers?
let me check.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
see you later.
see you.
Hi. - Hey.
come in.
how's the date training going?
let's just say I'm making the world safer for ovaries everywhere.
it's nice of you to help him.
Oh, it's not nice.
it's a public service.
I mean, he's a walking disaster.
he doesn't have a clue about women.
this girl he's after?
she's not the sharpest tool in the shed.
and his sense of humor?
sort of specific.
so, strike one.
she's not gonna notice how funny he is.
strike two is those t-shirts he wears.
I'm a t-shirt girl, so I get it.
but that Dava person?
can I just say, we're gonna need an extreme makeover.
is there a strike three?
he doesn't know how to talk to girls.
I guarantee you...
he brings up on-line gaming, and he's a virgin till he's 30.
but you like on-line gaming.
Yeah, well, he's not going on a date with me.
sounds like he should be.
Um...ew?
did you find anything?
nothing yet.
what would you do if you could predict the future?
wished I could have done it sooner.
will you tell me about them?
your wife and daughter.
keep looking.
Oh, hello.
hello.
um, can I help you?
Oh, Nicole's expecting me.
Oh, well, her office is this way.
I know.
we haven't officially met.
I'm Lori.
Jessi.
I know you're new in town, so let me know if you need anything.
what would I need?
I could fill you in on all things Settle.
people to know, places to see.
like I-- I saw you hanging out with Declan Mcdonough.
he and I used to be very close, so...
if you have any questions, I could answer them for you.
questions? - He can be like any guy.
a real ass when he puts his mind to it, in fact, but...
under all that I can tell you he's got a really good heart.
does your heart pound like a drum when he's near?
I didn't hear you come in.
that's okay.
uh, shall we head to my office?
Yep.
this car is gonna be a babe mobile.
like money in the bank. Ka-ching.
what?
nothing.
back to work.
you get to the house.
what do you do?
easy.
roll up, honk the horn.
stop.
you give your date the beep-beep, and the only person you'll have running out of the house will be her dad...to pound on you.
you go to the door.
attempt to be cool.
I knew that.
now, she's in the car. Show me what you're gonna do.
what? With you?
if you can't do it with me, how are you gonna do it with a real girl?
I mean-- you know what I mean.
come on.
pretend I'm your date.
look, I'm the irresistible Dava.
make your move.
I don't even know why I bother with you.
it's the car.
let me ask you a question.
why did you ask her out?
I can't just be because of her boobs.
Oh, my god.
it was.
you okay?
Yeah.
your stupid just sucked all the air outta the car.
here, I'll get the window.
Josh? - You get fired already?
I'm just grabbing some software and then I'm heading back.
well, times have changed.
none of my dates ever helped me get my car running beforehand.
dad, this isn't my date.
it's just Andy.
Oh, well, hi, there. - Hello.
she's helping me polish my game to a mirror-like shine.
well, we better put some time in this thing, otherwise your date, whoever she is, will be riding your handlebars.
we've been at this for hours.
Baylin didn't record anything about premonitions.
this is useless.
when I touched the book I found myself in another vision.
but this time instead of Baylin's urn, I saw the man himself.
what happened?
what did you see?
Adam was there.
he gave me this.
you wrote that.
you walked over here, you picked up the pad and you wrote that yourself.
well, it's definitely your handwriting.
you must have sent it to yourself.
forgotten I sent it?
you must have been in some kind of altered state, like before when you said you saw Baylin.
but why send myself something so cryptic?
why not just write what I knew was coming?
we may be looking at this in the wrong angle.
what if you're not seeing the future?
it could be your subconscious trying to tell you something, something from your past.
the things that you're seeing, they could be symbols for something else.
Nicole called them visions.
You're...talking to her about this?
you can't!
I am the only one that you can trust.
if you have a question or you need to talk about something, you come to me.
I'm just confused.
why is this happening to me now?
well, we've been working hard, making progress, maybe your mind had to reach a certain level of control before these visions could present themselves.
the important thing now is trying to figure out what the message is that you're trying to send to yourself.
I just hope we can.
I don't know how much longer I can take this.
I feel like I can't trust anything I see.
no, that's real.
and it's really out of tune.
and your eyes are where?
on her face.
not her chest.
what are the three l's?
listen, listen, listen.
and at the end of the night?
feel her up.
kidding.
feel it out, and if the moment seems right, kiss her.
no tongue.
I guess you're as good as you're gonna get.
Hey, Andy?
thanks for everything.
just don't blow it.
this is a one-time charitable donation.
Hi.
Hi.
can I sit?
sure.
so, I think we've hit the end of our break-up drama shelf life.
proper exchanges, avoiding eye contact, all that.
it's getting kind of tedious.
so, I just wanted to say that I'm done, and we should be able to inhabit each other's space drama-free.
that's good.
and we should be able to talk like two civilized people.
okay.
and if we're talking and everything, then I should be able to warn you about crazytown.
Crazytown?
Oh, come on, new hot patient of my mom's.
I have seen the spark age and I know how you boys like the crazies.
is this the part where you say we should still be friends?
if so, your lead-in kind of sucks.
I'm sorry.
I'm being exactly the kind of girl that I hate.
let's start over.
I'm Lori Trager, passive aggressive mean girl.
Declan Mcdonough, crazy-chick magnet.
I guess I walked into that one.
Yeah.
I'm playing tonight.
you should come.
are all your songs going to be about the cruelty of teenage boys?
you're supposed to write from experience.
Hey.
Hi.
I've got to run.
I just want to make sure you're coming to open mic night.
are you playing, too?
no, I'm running the soundboard.
they're paying me, so it'll get me one step closer to getting another piano.
I'm all messed up without one.
and playing the piano unmissed you.
when I play, everything that drags me down and distracts me disappears.
music brings me clarity.
clarity.
I could use some of that.
couldn't we all?
so will you be there?
I will.
great, then I'll see you.
if music helped Amanda, maybe that's what I needed to shed my distractions and better understand the visions I'd been having.
so, have you thought about what you want to do with your life?
what do you mean?
well, have you thought about your future?
my future?
no, not really.
Jessi, your parents may not have always made the best choices for you, but you can change that now.
you make your own choices.
I was amazed by what I was seeing.
they were my memories cataloged of everything since I'd left the pod.
I had developed a new ability.
I had complete control over my memories.
I want you to remember this moment.
those were the words that started my visions.
what was the moment I needed to remember?
I want you to remember this moment.
that was it.
remember this moment.
after I'm gone, all of my experiences, everything that I've studied and learned, will be yours.
you're special, Kyle.
you see the world from a unique perspective.
your mind's a powerful tool.
protect it.
I discovered not only could I relive my memories,
I could actually move within them, allowing me to view any moment from anywhere I wanted.
protect it.
use it wisely.
it was the book I had touched at the warehouse.
I realized that Baylin had hidden something inside.
you're more important than your mind.
it's your soul that touches people.
all of my memories had led me to this disc, but Adam's message still eluded me.
foss, I need to talk to you.
it's important.
those things can be a real pain.
I think the new guy just can't work the door.
maybe you're just punching in the wrong numbers.
well, they wrote them down for me here.
well, is that one a four or a nine?
it's a four, right?
says the man who can't open the door.
here.
Thanks.
I'm Emily, by the way.
Stephen, and, uh, thanks.
Oh, don't worry about it.
look, let me take you to the lunchroom.
coffee machine in there, now that's the real test of intelligence.
Oh, wow, I love that shade of green.
sorry I'm late.
it's not quite purring yet, huh?
more like coughing up hairballs.
well, just a few more tweaks, we're almost there.
I remember my first time.
gross, dad.
I meant date, Josh.
Jenny Marie, she wore those daisy dukes.
despite further mental images I'll have to purge, what happened?
nothing, really.
it wasn't that great.
why wasn't it great?
well, I don't know.
there was just no...tap tap?
you know when I first took your mother out.
uh, define "tap" please.
you know, my foot.
when I first took out your mother, there was just this excitement, and in the middle of dinner I realized my foot just kept tapping.
look, all I'm saying is, every guy has the idea of a perfect date, but the truth is, the right fit isn't always what you expect.
go ahead, try it again.
we need E. T.
not to put any pressure on you, but it's a 117 minutes before I take my first step into the great dating game of life.
try it.
you forgot to open the fuel valve.
it's always the thing right in front of you.
who cares?
it's alive!
I made your favorite, spaghetti.
I miss mom's.
I'll just be a sec.
I know, sweetie.
mommy will make you dinner tomorrow night.
Yeah, I know that I promised it would be tonight, but mommy has to work late.
tell you what.
I will come by and tuck you in, so pick out a book with grandma.
Yeah, of course, any book.
all right. Two books.
I love you, too.
all right. See you soon.
who were you talking to?
Ah, just someone from work.
okay.
here you go. Jess, I have to leave for a while.
you stay here. Don't leave the apartment.
mushrooms are good.
what? - Mushrooms.
I thought I didn't like them. - Oh.
remember? They were on my pizza at my ninth birthday.
I got sick? Mom said I was allergic.
well, then I guess you are.
then why can I have them on the spaghetti now?
people change, Jess.
I can change.
I can choose for myself now.
some things, yes.
other things are decided for you.
you stay in the apartment.
is that clear?
got it.
"viz allati" means "underwater."
underwater.
underwater.
underwater.
using parts from Josh's car radio,
I designed a way to play the CD, a way Adam knew only I could figure out.
Kyle, if you're listening to this, you've passed a critical test.
here is your reward.
memories are important.
when I knew that I would not always be here to guide you,
I knew I'd need a way to communicate, in order to share my experiences, and more importantly, assure you that you would never be alone.
this is the beginning, Kyle.
your holographic memory will become an important power to master.
the ability to explore your memories will allow you to see things that others, and even you, have missed.
so study the past, Kyle...
and understand that all of the answers are already hidden in front of you.
at first I was relieved to have the answer, but then something struck me as odd.
why all that work for such a simple message?
any premonitions about my date?
Why? Are you nervous?
Andy says nervousness is the last refuge for the unprepared.
sounds like her.
you look nice.
Andy says this color looks good with my eyes.
you know, once you get past the smart-ass remarks and references that I have to google to understand...
she's - pretty great?
Yeah.
anyway, about tonight.
predict my future.
think I'll get lucky?
I think you already are.
you're starting to sound like a Hallmark card.
is that for-- yes.
it's very sweet.
good luck, little brother. - You, too.
we better go, too. We're gonna be late.
where did you find a piano?
here.
I'll be right back.
you look very singer/songwriter.
there are a lot of people here.
fifty doesn't exactly constitute a - okay, so it's not a stadium.
but still, I don't wanna, you know, suck.
you won't suck.
if you get nervous, just look over at me and remember how mad you are.
it'll be a nice distraction.
I'm not mad at you, anymore.
no? - No.
shelf life, remember?
cool.
Oh, my god. You did the beep-beep thing, didn't you?
I didn't beep. I knocked.
and then I waited.
and then I sat on the porch for another 20 minutes.
you got stood up?
seems so.
and since we didn't exactly cover that part in out training - I thought maybe - wait here.
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Whoa, wait.
you're not gonna kick her ass, are you?
no.
but I planned the perfect first date, and no way in hell is it going to waste.
you're going on my date with me?
it's my date now.
does that mean you're buying?
come on.
okay, this is it.
don't worry.
perfect.
hello.
Hi.
I met you.
I remember.
I asked about you.
what did you find out?
that you have a good heart.
want to feel mine?
this is definitely a sign that I should not play tonight.
why do you think that?
because I wrote a song about -
and he's with - playing tonight isn't about them.
it's about you.
if you wanna play...play.
she needed that... to know everything was gonna be okay.
you're due for something good, too.
how do you know?
I can predict the future.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm - I'm hot.
you should get some air.
Yeah.
Hi, everyone. I'm Lori.
you feel better?
I feel great.
kiss me. - What?
don't make me ask again.
as I listened to Lori play I understood that the future would reach us all in different ways.
sometimes it would take your breath away...
sometimes it would be different than the version you planned.
Baylin was right.
the only certainty for the future is that the answers to the unknown are most likely hidden right in front of us.
the sound waves gave me the answer.
Baylin's true message was an alpha-numeric cipher.
each number corresponded to a letter.
and "viz allati" was the key to unscrambling it.
I wondered why he had gone to such great lengths to ensure only I could read it.
must LEAVE BACK SOON FOSS
finally, I understood what he wanted to tell me.
don't TRUST FOSS
I went to the warehouse to talk to him...
but Foss and all traces of him were gone.
Oh, God.
well, what the hell happened?
we're an old married couple. - Mmm-hmm.
was it the pot?
I don't think so, because we brought it with us from New York.
Yeah. - It's the same.
what was that...
what was that old movie?
you know, Blame it on Rio.
it has to be that, it has to be that.
you got to feel my heart.
are you going to make it till dinner time?
after dinner time.
Oh, God.
God, I'd love to live like this.
Yeah.
I'm willing, if you have enough money to stay in Brazil for the rest of our lives.
I'll think about it.
okay.
do you think that's it, being away?
Yeah. - Yeah.
Hey, babe.
where did you go?
don't do this to yourself.
everything is wonderful.
everything is wonderful.
Yeah.
good luck. See you in a bit.
I love you.
okay.
don't touch anything. Don't say anything. Back up.
turn off the lights. Turn them off.
are you... Don't even think about the buzzer.
get in the corner.
is the cash in here? Open it up. Open it up!
quicker. Get over here. Get over here. You want me to fucking shoot you?
open it up. Open it up.
get over in the corner. Get over in the corner. Keep your hands down.
keep your fucking hands down.
all right?
come over here. Get over here so I can see you.
come over here. Stand at the corner. Come over here.
put your hands down. Put your hands down.
Oh, shit! Is this all you got in here?
I'm watching... Stay away from the fucking buzzer, all right.
fucking shit, it's all she... Get back in your corner.
get back in your fucking... Get back in your corner!
all right, keep your hands down by your side, all right. I'm watching you.
I will shoot you, all right. I'll fucking shoot you in a second.
this is all shit.
diamonds.
Where's the fucking keys for this case?
Where's the... Where are the keys for this case?
in the drawer. - Shut up, all right.
these are them? Don't fucking move, all right.
don't move.
what, are they all the same?
are they?
fucking stupid bitch.
I'm watching you.
which fucking key... Which fucking... This is bullshit!
what the fuck is up...
what type of glass is this...
fuck is up with this glass?
fuck this...
bullshit.
fuck this...
fuck, no.
fuck you, you mother fucking stupid fuck.
fuck.
my gun.
fuck! Andy!
Hank, you're so stupid!
fucking Andy!
shit.
Hey, two for four. You're batting. 500.
no, Dad, the second one was an air...
no, no. It was a perfectly placed bunt. - Good game, sweetheart.
good game. How many you got?
Yeah, who's going to want seconds?
uncle Andy, can I have another hot dog?
Yeah, the way you played today, I'll buy you the whole stand.
no, her mother doesn't want her eating junk, all right?
that's not junk, that's all right. That's a hot dog, right, honey?
what do I owe you?
Hey, Hank, your money is no good here.
no, I got it, okay.
I got it. - You sure?
that was a good game. - Yeah.
Hey, give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.
all right. I'll see you next weekend? - I love you.
all right, be good. Here's your ball.
you didn't feed her junk, did you? - No, of course not.
I don't want her to develop bad eating habits.
she looks puffy. - She doesn't look puffy, all right.
you look puffy. - Fuck you.
she wore sun block? - It was cloudy, Martha.
there are rays, Hank. Hey, you got my money?
Oh, Christ, Martha. Do you have any idea what that school is costing me?
you're the one who wanted to send her there.
Yeah, because it is a damn good school and she wanted to go there.
you owe me three months. - I don't owe you.
I owe Danielle. - Don't get semantic.
Bye. - April, May and June.
no, I promise, all right.
what's up, Hank?
piece of shit!
fuck you. All right. Can I borrow your cell phone?
I don't have one.
just... - It's brain cancer. There's a pay phone - Over there by the bathroom. - No, it can wait.
what's happening with you?
I used to think you had the world by the balls.
now, I'm not sure if you even got any.
I got them when I need them, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, smart and funny.
what I always admired about you, your wit.
you're a prick, Andy. - I always was.
so, let's see if there're any left. - What?
well, you need money. So do I. Let's solve it.
what are you talking about? - Well, there's a place we can knock off.
know it like the back of our hand. Easiest money you'll ever get.
what are you saying?
it's worth about 600 grand.
and it's insured, so it's a victimless crime.
I offer that in case your faggoty little conscience bothers you.
I weigh it off on 20 cents on the dollar.
that's 60 grand each.
give or take.
I can't believe this is you that's talking.
believe it.
so, it's safe, nobody gets hurt, everybody wins. It's perfect.
Why?
what do...
do you need money? - Of course, I need money. But this is...
this is serious crime, Andy. I'm not a serious crime kind of a guy. I got a kid...
you've got shit.
you have a whole lot of shit. You said so yourself.
all the time. Every day.
you know what? It's not as serious as you might think.
you're my little brother. Now, trust me.
God, Andy.
that's why you called me up?
that's why you wanted to spend the night together, - Talk me into something crazy? - That's why I called you up.
talk you into something crazy.
well, what's the place?
no, not another word till you commit.
fuck.
it's all right.
so, how's the wife?
Hey, Hank.
Hey, I got an appointment.
I'll be back in a few, all right. - Of course, you will. It's Thursday.
you're early. - Well...
you know my days are so busy.
just tell me that you'll think about it.
but I thought about it already. And I came to the conclusion that you're crazy.
I'm going to go where with you?
I mean, you've got child support.
you've got Danielle's school, you've got the rent...
the mortgage... - Come on.
...you're up to your ears in debt, Hank. - I can solve all that. I know I can.
when are you going to grow up, Hank?
we have a really good thing going, and you should just enjoy it.
we have a really good time in bed. I don't ask for anything.
I love you. I want more.
so does Oliver Twist.
can I help you to seconds?
or do you really, really, really have to get back?
huh?
the weight of this sad time we must obey.
speak what we feel and not what we ought to say.
the oldest hath borne most.
we that are young shall never see so much, nor live so long.
Bravo! Bravo!
you were great. I'm so proud of you.
you were wonderful.
grandpa and I thought you were wonderful.
excuse me, I'm sorry. It's just... I have to have your autograph.
dad. No. - What, you were incredible.
no, stop it. - What?
I messed up some of my lines. - No, you didn't. I didn't notice.
did you notice? - I didn't notice at all.
honey, you were great. What?
mom, can I go see The Lion King this weekend?
there's a class trip, everyone's going. - Did you ask your father?
can I, Dad? - Yeah, sure. I got some money.
well, it's $130.
but we're staying overnight and that includes hotel and everything.
okay, great. Yeah.
Yeah. - Hey, man. Can I talk to you?
where are you? - I'm down the hall, by the coffee.
how about my office, 30 seconds? - All right.
Hank, the super at 111 Riverside says the boiler's really kaput.
he needs you to... Hello?
so?
that place that you were talking about. - What place?
the one that we were going to... - To knock off?
Yeah.
to rob?
you say it.
tell me about it.
I'm not going to tell you about it until you say you're in and once you say it, there's no way out.
I'm in.
let me see your hands.
just say it again, "I'm in. " - What're you talking about?
just say it again, I'm in.
I'm in.
what?
I just wanted to see if you were pulling any of that chickenshit baby stuff like when we were kids, you know, "It doesn't count. I had my fingers crossed."
I'm in. What're we doing?
and when? - It's a jewelry store.
does this ring a bell? - No.
what if I tell you it's got a Foot Locker on one side and a Claire's Accessories on the other.
Yeah, that's right. You got it. Now, listen.
we don't want Tiffany's. We want a Mom and Pop operation, in a busy place, on a Saturday when the week's takes go in the safe.
we both worked there. We know the safe combinations.
we know the burglar alarm signals. We know where everything is.
I figure, between the week's take, the jewelry and the cases, the vault, there's a $500, 000 haul.
I figure probably six.
that old dumb old lady that works there, she's alone till noon.
she's not going to be a problem.
Andy.
yeah?
that's Mom and Dad's store.
that's what I said.
a Mom and Pop operation.
you can't do that. - Yeah, we can. Think about it.
it's perfect. It's perfect.
in and out in a minute.
insurance takes care of Mom and Dad, so they're not hurt. Right?
no one's going to give a shit. After a week the cops - will put it in the back of the filing cabinet. - Jesus, Andy. I...
why did you even want me in on this?
well, it'll solve everything for both of us.
what has to be solved for you?
same as you. I need money. I'm going to start over again.
what do you mean?
what the fuck kind of... It's none of your business.
I just want out. I just want to... That's all.
I'm getting out, I want to help my little brother.
come on.
Yeah.
no, I don't think I can do this. I don't think I can...
Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can.
I just...
that's $2, 000.
it's an advance.
see what just that much does for you.
and, imagine the rest.
five, six, seven, eight, nine hundred dollars.
you still owe me May and June.
Yeah, Monday. All right. Everything on Monday.
that's what I said. - Such a loser.
you're such a fucking loser.
I come over here with $900.
Yeah, well, if it was for me, maybe. - And I'm the fucking... All right.
may and June, asshole. - Bye, bye, bye.
Danielle, dinner.
no, please don't put me on... Jesus.
yo, Bobby. - What's going on?
Hey, here, let me buy you a drink. - I'm working.
I ain't loaning you no more money. - No, come on, man. I'm flush.
you don't exactly... - Yeah, something like that.
look, you just... If you're free tomorrow morning,
I got a proposition for you.
later. - All right.
what if there is a security guard? - There isn't.
Why? - No, it's a Mom and Pop place.
who ever heard of a Mom and Pop jewelry store?
what the fuck is that? - It's in the suburbs, all right.
it's not in the city.
I don't know.
we drive out there, we check it out, if anything looks off, you know, we just drive away.
we say, "Fuck it," we drive our happy asses home and I keep the money anyway.
Yeah, fine.
you keep the money anyway.
Hanson? - Yeah, that's me.
all right.
Yeah. - Bobby, for Christ's sakes, - Bobby, we got to go. - Just come on in.
I just got to throw on some clothes. It'll only take a second.
we got to go.
just give me a second. - God damn it.
Jesus Christ, Bobby, it's so fucking early.
boo wakes up, you fucking sit up with him.
I told you it was work. - I don't give a fuck what it is.
Chris ain't used to getting up this early.
Oh, Christ.
come on, babe. Here.
thank you, baby. - Yeah, just keep it down, okay?
you wake Boo up, I'll kick your ass.
all right. - Yours, too.
all right.
come on.
all right, let's do it.
are we there? - No.
all right.
who the fuck are you supposed to be?
look, I used to work there, all right. I used to work there and I can't take a chance on being recognized. Don't... Look...
you ain't never done this before, huh? - Yeah, so?
I got to tell you something, you look like a fucking asshole.
Yeah, all right, look... - I'm going to do this on my own.
Really? - You do the driving, I do the thing, all right.
what if you need help? - I got all the help I need.
there's no shooting.
I ain't looking for it. - There's no shooting.
you do the driving. - Hey.
I do the thing. - No shooting.
you ain't got the balls to do the thing. I got the balls - and I got a gun. That's the deal. - Listen, no shooting.
or else I'm leaving right now. - Hey, no!
just no shooting, okay?
okay. Ten more minutes.
what the fuck is this?
you can listen to that faggoty shit all the way home.
right now, I got to get into character.
right? - Okay.
okay.
this is it.
you ready?
car out front. Door open. I jump back in. You take off.
right? - Right.
let's do it. - All right.
Yes, hi, hello. Is Andrew Hanson available, please?
uh...
Mooney. Mooney. Okay, yeah, tell him it's Mooney.
Yeah. - There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.
he sounds like some nut case. - Okay.
but... - All right, I'll take it.
it just came apart, Andy.
Oh, my God, Andy.
what the fuck am I gonna do?
no, honey, no, don't worry. It's just some mistake.
it's either the bank's or mine.
maybe I didn't put enough money in the joint account.
Yeah. No. Listen, don't worry.
of course, we have the cash. I'll call, I'll take care of it. Okay?
Yes, okay?
Andy? - Yeah. Yeah.
we're waiting for you in the conference room.
okay, I'll be right in.
Jesus.
okay, next.
the auditors.
some of you guys might have heard, we're getting hit with an IRS audit.
the auditors will be here on Monday.
they'll spend a day or two with each department.
on Monday, they'll start with payroll, so you're up first, Andy.
great. Great. No problem.
how are you doing today, sir?
thanks a lot.
hungry?
have a drink.
right, tonic water.
you know, the thing about real estate accounting is that you can, you can head down the page or across the page, and everything works out. So, every day, everything adds up.
well, the total is always the sum of its parts.
it's clean, it's clear, neat, absolute.
but my life, it...
it doesn't add up. It's...
nothing connects to anything else. It's...
I'm not the sum of my parts.
all of my parts don't add up to one...
to one me, I guess.
get a shrink or a wife.
I got a wife. - Get a shrink.
excuse me. Sorry.
was it me, honey?
what difference does it make?
it's another strikeout.
I swear it would make a lot of difference.
you're all I want. - Yeah, well...
I'm a lousy cook. The house looks like shit.
I'm a lousy lay, I don't know why you wanna keep me.
you weren't in Rio.
I wasn't what?
lousy lay.
well, like you said, just blame it on Rio.
suppose I could get us back there.
what?
Rio.
to live? - Absolutely.
you're just crazy. Crazy. - No. It's not crazy.
the real estate market's booming in Rio. There's a lot of new money.
and they're going to want the same as Europeans, Arabs, everybody wants real estate in New York, in America and I know the market here.
you don't even speak the language.
I'll fucking learn it. Jesus Christ.
you know when...
when you met me, my biggest prospect was inheriting a Mom and Pop jewelry store in a fucking shopping mall in Westchester.
now, I know it's not Trump Plaza, and...
but just take a look at how we're living now.
now, I took that lousy job in that, that real estate office, I was practically a fucking gofer,
I know the angles.
I bet you do.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
well, because there is no extradition agreement between Brazil and the United States.
how the...
how the hell do you know that?
I saw it in a movie.
Yeah, I guess I saw the same movie.
so, what are you thinking? What are you thinking?
what are you thinking? What are you thinking?
don't ask, don't tell.
I just want us to get back there.
I've seen Heaven, Gina, it's a nice place to stay.
okay? All right? - Uh-huh.
what language do they speak there? - Portuguese.
I speak a little Spanish.
that's... I'm sorry, sweetheart, that's not the same language.
Yes, it is. - I'm sorry, it's not.
Yes, it is. Yes, it is. - No.
Gina.
why'd you come to me?
I know you from way back, I know what you do.
you're a cop.
no, I'm not a cop, I just want to make sure you're still around.
I'll bring you what I've got soon, either you take it or you don't.
but I know you will.
you could work for the cops.
check me out.
I'll be back.
that's $2, 000.
it's an advance.
see what just that much does for you, and imagine the rest.
Yeah, so how do we start? Oh, fuck. - It's not we, you.
me?
what the hell do I know about robbing a jewelry store?
you'll learn it there. On-the-job training, you know.
cut it out, man, this is serious.
you know, I'm serious as a heart attack. Listen, number one, I can't...
I can't go up to the mall. - Why not?
Oh God, three months ago,
I had to walk the whole goddamn area with a Home Depot representative, 'cause they were thinking of buying up a lot of space.
we own a lot of land in the mall, and I'm getting a lot of big handshakes. "Andy, baby, how are you?"
I haven't seen you in so long since you left.
and telling me all that bullshit because they figure I'm making a killing, because a big chain wants to buy them out.
I'm saying someone's going to just recognize me too easy.
so we postpone, just...
Yeah, we could, you know, wait a year.
I mean, I don't know about you, my problems are pressing.
Jesus, Andy, I... Andy!
I wouldn't even know how to start, I mean. - Well, you can stop being a baby.
I'm not being a... - Yeah, you're being a baby.
get a gun. You get a toy gun in a kid's store.
right, that old lady that works on Saturday, what's her name?
Doris? - Yeah, Doris, Mom's friend.
she's what, 60, 70? She's blind as a bat?
look at me. Blind as a bat.
all right, those toy guns, they look so real, they fool cops all the time.
all right, you go in at 8: 00 a. m. just as she opens up.
you put her old ass in the back room, you empty the vault, the cash, the trays and you dump it in a fucking sack.
all right. You don't gotta be neat about it.
Jesus, Andy, I don't know. I don't know, I don't... I...
I don't know.
okay. Come on.
you can do it.
you can do it.
anybody can.
I just think... - I know, I know. It's too late to think.
it's too late.
this is our future.
okay.
Yeah. - There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.
he sounds like some nut case. But...
okay, I got it.
it just came apart, Andy.
Oh, my God, Andy.
what the fuck am I gonna do?
could he be in a different wing?
if you just pipe down a second, sir, I'm trying to help you.
what are you doing here? - Keep quiet one minute.
dad called me, all right. I just got here.
this lady, she doesn't... - Look, Miss, our father... I got it.
I got it. I know, but you might... - I told him, we've got no Charles Hanson.
wait a minute, I got a Nanette Hanson.
what? - There's a Nanette Hanson.
brought in about three hours ago. - What?
gunshot wounds.
where is she? - Emergency ICU.
Hey. Now. Hey, hold it. Wait, are you related? Sir? Are you?
dad?
she's unconscious.
and they...
she's...
they...
they say...
so, how are you feeling?
Yeah, I feel old.
I've been studying all week, and I can't retain a thing.
come on, you're going to pass with flying colors, Dad.
that's how I'm going to spend my birthday, taking that stupid test.
have you spoken to your brothers?
few weeks ago.
yeah? How are they?
busy.
you know, Dad, Hank is Hank and Andy's Andy.
no more cramming, birthday boy. It's the moment of truth.
what time is Doris coming to the store?
she said 12: 00 at the latest.
she has to baby-sit for her daughter.
I'll pick you up right after my test.
come on, come on.
all right, all right, all right.
perfect score, Mr. Hanson. - Bingo!
Congratulations.
if you'll take this to Window C, they'll give you the eye test.
I might not do so well on that one.
I've been studying hard, of course. Thanks. - All right.
that's my store!
what happened? What's happening? Let's go!
sir, sir, just stay behind the yellow line. - What's happening?
I want to know what's happening. - Behind the yellow line.
Where's my wife? Where's my wife? - Calm down. Please calm down.
I love you.
there are more tests we can do, but from what we've seen so far, it's very unlikely.
there's no brain activity.
and statistically speaking, there's very little chance for recovery.
why was Mom working?
I thought she didn't work at the store anymore, that's what Katherine told me.
Doris had to baby-sit, I had to get down to the DMV, get my eyes tested.
today's my birthday.
Where's your brother?
he...
he says he can't take it. To let him know if...
if he can help, but he just can't see her like that.
he's 28 years old.
he's a goddamn punk from Red Hook.
red Hook. What was he doing up here? What in the fucking world? What he...
I mean, did he put a map on the wall and throw a dart?
it's so absurd. It's so goddamn arbitrary.
why me? Why her?
what was this goddamn kid doing?
you belong in hell.
Yeah. I understand. All right. Thank you.
look, it might be better if you call, make an appointment?
well, I'd rather wait.
please. Steve...
dad.
you have to make a decision, Dad.
the gun was bought in Texas.
stolen Texas driver's license, his ID, fake, the gun turns up in New York, a year later.
mom needs you to make a decision, Dad. - Andy, just leave him alone.
well, something has to be done, he has to make a decision.
just leave him to his grief for one minute.
mom is in the hands of Jesus. - Now, will you cut it out with that crap?
you shouldn't push Dad to make a decision he doesn't wanna make.
well, he has to make a decision.
Hey, Patrick.
we know it's difficult, Mr. Hanson.
let her go.
let her go.
let her go.
Almighty and ever living God.
remember the mercy with which you graced your daughter, Nanette, in this life.
receive her, we pray, into the mansions of the saints.
as we make ready our sister's resting place "Look also with favor on those who mourn.
and comfort them in their loss.
because God has chosen to call Nanette from this life, commit her body to the earth, for we are dust and to dust we shall return.
I'm so sorry for your loss. She was a wonderful person.
she was a wonderful woman. - Yes.
I'm so sorry. - You have my deepest condolences.
she was a dear friend.
so sorry for your loss, your mother was a good person.
I'm so sorry.
God bless you.
there's no way I can make this scene, Andy.
he was always such a baby.
Yeah.
I can't really talk right now.
I can't, I...
I have to go. Andy needs me.
22nd precinct.
detective Barrett, please.
just a moment, sir.
I'm sorry, he's not in right now.
is there anyone down there that knows anything about the Nanette Hanson case?
who's speaking, please? - Charles Hanson, yeah.
just a moment, sir.
sergeant Sullivan.
Yeah, good morning, Sergeant.
I've been trying to reach Detective Barrett but he doesn't return my calls.
would you like to leave a message, sir?
no, I wouldn't like to leave another message.
doesn't anyone down there give a damn?
doesn't anyone down there work for a living?
would you like to leave a message, sir?
don't you know how important this is to me?
I know, I just...
you know, I thought I was going to be able to work it out, but...
but I couldn't get the money together, you know.
all my friends think I'm going to be there, what am I going to tell them?
you know, I mean, there's going to be other field trips.
not to The Lion King, there won't.
look, Dad, if you weren't going to pay for it, you should have just said so and saved me the humiliation of having to tell all my friends that you're a loser.
Hey, this is Hank. I must be out, so leave a message at the beep.
I know you're there. Pick up the phone.
pick up the phone.
pick up the fucking phone, you fucking faggot.
Andy, I'm here. - Where have you been?
here. I called in sick.
and what the fuck were you doing with that fucking asshole?
I was scared, all right? So I... - I didn't say anything about
a fucking gun, God damn it.
but we got to talk.
Andy.
meet me at Mooney's.
you still can't get by? To see Mom?
what am I going to say? - Don't say anything. Fuck.
who else knows? - Nobody.
you didn't tell anyone? - No.
no one saw you talking with Bobby? - No.
all right. Nobody saw you here?
no, come on, it was crowded, it was busy. No, no.
did he rent the car with you? - Did he what?
did he rent the fucking car with you? - No, no, no.
all right, did you...
you picked him up? - Yeah.
at his house. - Did anyone see you there, at his house?
did anyone see you at his house? - No, no.
nobody saw you at the house? - No.
did you clean the car? Did you wipe the car down?
did you wipe the floor? - Yeah, I totally... Totally, totally.
did you leave anything in the car? - No, of course not.
we're probably okay.
if they don't connect the car to us, we're probably okay.
that's what I was thinking.
go back to work, totally normal. - Okay.
I'm so sorry, Andy. I'm sorry.
I don't think I can get through this.
shut up.
I loved her so much. - Just shut the fuck up.
if he had to take somebody out, why couldn't it have been him?
one new message.
this is Mike Steuben calling from Auto Rent for Mr. Henry Hanson.
Mr. Hanson, you returned a car the other day.
it seems you forgot some personal items in it.
please give me a call at 555-2649 and ask for Mike Steuben.
again, that number is 555-2649. Thank you.
end of messages.
okay. God.
okay.
Hello, you've reached Auto Rent. Our office is currently closed.
our business hours... - Fuck.
fuck!
okay. All right. It's okay, it's okay.
excuse me?
that's right, sir. It's $255 plus tax.
but for an additional $17, I could upgrade you to a luxury.
or, for... Yes.
no, that's right, the mid-size is $255 plus tax.
unless you'd like to upgrade to an SUV, which I could offer you for 29...
excuse me, is Mike Steuben here? No, I know, I'm just looking for Mike.
so, would you like to upgrade to the SUV?
no, no. No, mid-size is fine, sir.
no.
thank you for calling.
I'm sorry.
good morning, how can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I got a message from Mike Steuben.
apparently I left something in a vehicle that I returned last Saturday. I think it was a CD.
Oh, well, you would talk to Mr. Steuben, then. He's the manager.
Yeah, I know, so could I speak with him?
I'm sorry, he's not here. You'll have to come back.
when will he be in? - I don't...
he won't be in at all today.
well then, maybe you can help me.
Oh, no. Sorry, sir.
I'm sorry, excuse me.
do you think... - I'm sorry.
will he be in tomorrow? - Yes, Auto Rent.
no, I...
no, I didn't say that, sir. That's not up to me.
no.
excuse me, can I get a beer? Thanks.
that's the guy, that's him.
yo, buddy.
this guy? - Yeah.
you were with Bobby Lasorda, Saturday?
what? - I asked you a fucking question.
what? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
what's your name? - I'm Hank.
Hank what? - You know what?
come. Why don't you... Let's go.
follow me, we can talk over here.
come on. Have a seat. - Is this all right?
Yeah, this is perfect.
so...
what's the deal, huh?
my sister is quite all of a sudden a widow. - Yeah.
she says you and Bobby had some work.
Bobby said it was work.
work that involved him getting shot and killed, but not you getting shot and killed.
no, I just got him the car.
I'm so sorry. - What the fuck does that mean?
well, Bobby said that he needed to rent a car, but that he...
this was Friday night and he didn't have a credit card, so I told him that I would rent him a car.
and I owed him some money. You know. That's it, I swear. It's...
I'm so sorry.
so what? You're lying. - No, I'm not.
because if Bobby wanted a car, he would have fucking stolen one.
Chris, go fucking wait outside.
let me handle this.
you got a driver's license?
a what? - You know, the...
the driver's license you show when you rent a car?
Yeah.
let me see it. - Yeah.
all right, sure.
here.
Henry Hanson. - Yeah.
this is your address, right?
Yeah, sure.
I'm going to be straight with you, chico.
you mind if I call you chico?
people call me Hank.
Bobby was a piece of shit.
I know it, you know it. That's not the point.
the point is that piece of shit was the father of my sister's child.
and he was paying the bills.
and now he's dead.
and I'm thinking, who's going to pay all these bills?
I'm so sorry.
sorry ain't going to pay the bills, chico.
I know, I know.
we need to negotiate a settlement, so make me an offer.
ten grand, done. It's 10 grand. I consider us even.
if you don't like 10, I can make it 15.
no. - My sister wants me to kill you.
or I could call the cops.
but I don't like cops.
and the cops ain't going to pay my sister's bills.
so, I think a settlement is pretty fair all-around.
day after tomorrow, chico. - Can I?
here. 8: 00.
you fucking crazy?
I was hoping that you had something left over from the settlement.
lend you money? You owe me $2, 000.
shocked to shit you'd even ask.
Martha,
I'm in serious trouble.
I don't give a shit what kind of trouble you're in.
the next time you show up here, better be to pay me.
listen, tell Danielle I love her.
if you loved her, you'd pay her fucking child support.
I'm so sorry for your loss. She was a wonderful person.
wonderful woman.
she was a wonderful woman.
God bless you.
there's no way I can make this scene, Andy.
he was always such a baby.
Yeah.
Hey, Gina. - I can't really talk right now.
Andy needs me. I got to go.
Gina, Gina.
excuse me, is Mike Steuben here?
not till noon, can I help you? - Yeah, yeah.
I returned a car last Saturday and I guess I forgot something.
Hanson?
that's right, Hanson. Yeah, and I'm pretty sure it was a CD.
hang on.
here we go, Mr. Hanson.
great. - I just need to see some ID.
Yeah, you know, I...
I lost my license.
you have a credit card, the one you used to rent the car with?
Yeah.
Yeah, this one. - All right.
okay, great.
thank you. - Take care.
Hello? - It's me.
Andy, Jesus! Fuck, man, we got problems.
Hi, Andy. This is Jake at the office.
really sorry to bother you, but the auditors are coming tomorrow.
they've noticed a few problems.
it's pretty urgent, so give a call when you get this.
you're going to have to get some sleep tonight.
have you given any thought to the store?
I mean, you're going to have to give it some consideration. It's just gonna...
I could open it up for you, you know, while you're at the hospital.
a few hours a day.
so people know you're still there.
I should burn the goddamn place down.
Andy, this is Jake.
now I hope you're checking your messages because we have a real mess here.
the auditors say that there's two terminated employees from your department still drawing checks.
and there's something about unpaid OASDI taxes.
look, you need to call us...
I got to go to the office tomorrow.
there's a problem. I'll go in the morning. I should be back later.
okay?
his mother's dying, and he's going back to work.
Yes!
pick up the phone.
I know you're there, pick up the phone, you fucking faggot.
Andy, I'm here.
what are you doing here? You don't have an appointment.
you know the deal, you can't just show up. - I know, I'm sorry.
come back in an hour, tonic water.
my mom's dying.
bummer.
next time, make an appointment.
stupid piece of shit.
stop talking to me like that.
what the fuck?
are you going to get tough?
are you going to hurt me?
why was there even a gun?
why was there even a fucking gun?
I gave you all the information you needed. Why was Bobby Lasorda even there?
why the fuck? - I didn't think I could do it alone.
I should fucking kill you.
how are we going to fix it so your shit don't fall on my shoes?
so, think now, who else knows?
commit her body to the earth.
for we are dust and to dust we shall return.
but the Lord Jesus will change our mortal bodies to be like his in glory.
so let us commend our sister to the Lord.
she hated it when I barbecued.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be what you wanted me to be.
I've never been very good at talking about feelings or showing you that kind of affection or support.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to be the father you wanted.
but I guess I wanted you to be better than me.
and I thought that if I push...
it may not mean anything to you, but I want you to know that I really do love you.
and I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm just so sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be the son you wanted.
you did the best you could.
still, yeah.
manage to seem to still like Hank.
he was a lot more of a fuck-up than I was.
he was the baby. - Yeah.
he needed us more. - Yeah, he needed you more.
you sure it wasn't his cute looks or his puppiness?
you were the first.
the first always has it rougher.
Yeah, so I'm told.
you know, the four of you, I never felt like I was part of the club.
you sure I'm your son?
Gina and I have got to get back to the city.
Andy?
my dad.
Andy.
okay.
why don't we pull over?
my dad.
Oh, God.
it's not fair! It's not fair!
all my life I've been afraid of becoming like him. All my life!
all my life with you, and it's not fair.
he can't just say he's sorry and make it all go away.
it's too late.
it's not that easy!
it's not fair! It's not fucking fair!
no, Dad.
Oh, God!
he can't do that!
Andy.
Andy.
I'll be back in a bit. - Where are you going?
I'll be back soon, I just got to... I got to deal with some stuff.
what's going on?
what if you come home and I'm not here?
you got some place you got to be?
your boss called and he wants you to call him right away.
are you in trouble?
they just miss me.
something has to change.
what do you mean? - I mean that this just isn't working.
what's not working? - The life that we have.
it was really bad before Rio and now it's even worse.
you never tell me anything that's going on anymore.
I don't understand.
neither do I.
what was that in the car yesterday?
I could help.
I don't need any help.
do you realize that I've been having an affair?
what's that supposed to mean?
means I've been fucking another guy.
every Thursday, me and your brother, Hank. We get together and we fuck.
not only that, he loves me.
and he still finds me attractive.
all the time.
not just on vacation.
Hank?
Yeah, Hank.
aren't you gonna say anything?
are you gonna get angry?
where are you gonna go? - I was just gonna go to my mother's.
How're you gonna get there?
I was gonna take a cab.
I could really use some, some money.
I'll go to the bank later.
here.
Hi, you've reached Gina and Andy. Leave a message.
please hang up and try your call...
come on.
last person I ever thought I'd see again as long as I lived.
Charlie Hanson.
you're still a crook?
you come all this way to insult me?
did you hear anything about a holdup at the Westchester Shopping Mall?
what would I know about Westchester?
that's just for upstanding citizens such as yourself.
have you heard anything?
why would I hear anything about anything? I sell diamonds.
and fence them. - Never!
did you hear of a young guy called Bobby Lasorda?
wrong tree, Charlie.
I'm sorry.
I don't give a shit about your little side business,
I don't care about anything anymore, except finding the guy who did this.
do you know anything?
I remember when Charlie Hanson started out on the streets.
young and cocky, good cutter. A long time ago, Charlie.
you always hated my guts, you called me a crook, but you didn't know shit about how the world works, or what some people will do for money.
I guess, now you know, Charlie.
the world is an evil place, Charlie.
some of us make money off of that, and others get destroyed.
he walked in here, he looks a little bit like you, Charlie.
he walked in here and I almost knew him, right off the bat.
hello.
it's me.
Andy, Jesus, man, we got problems.
what do you mean, problems?
Bobby's girlfriend's got a fucking brother, okay.
and the guy is blackmailing me, all right.
he said he's gonna go to the cops, all right, or kill me if I don't pay him $10, 000.
all right, all right.
just stay there, I'll be right over, I'll figure something out.
Andy, this guy isn't fucking around. - All right, I'll figure something out.
Andy, Jake needs to see you.
they're all in the conference room with the IRS guys.
they're going all the way back - through your accounts. - Just fuck 'em, I got to go to my dad's.
I'm gonna have to tell them you were here.
for God's sake, say something.
okay.
we're in trouble.
the worst trouble imaginable. You're aware of that, right?
so, why don't we try and fix it?
there's almost no choice, but you're gonna have to follow my lead.
no questions, no hesitations.
I've done that before, all right, and that's how come I'm standing here, with my life going down the fucking toilet.
fuck you, fuck you, I'll do it alone.
you can sit here and wait till you go to jail and take it up the ass for the rest of your fucking life.
let's do it already, what's your idea?
sorry, what's your idea?
what's Bobby's girlfriend's name?
Chris. Yeah, Chris.
Chris.
call Chris, tell her to get her brother over to her apartment.
what for? - We'll meet him.
he figures we owe him $10, 000, we have to resolve it.
resolve it how?
play it by ear, see what happens, maybe we pay him.
he's never gonna let us off the hook.
all right, we're gonna be paying him back for the rest of our lives.
Hey, you finally figured out something for yourself.
let's just get the money, see what happens.
where are we gonna get $10, 000?
no, that might be easier.
call Chris.
Taxi!
Andy, Jesus Christ! You're gonna kill him.
come on.
shit.
come on.
hold the bag. Hold out the fucking bag!
hold it open like this. Hold it open like that!
I got it, I got it.
Oh, shit, do you want these? - Just put it in the bag!
put it in the bag!
out. - Got it.
Oh, my God, Andy.
did you touch anything? - Did you go crazy?
did you touch anything? - Are you fucking nuts?
did you touch anything? - Wait, you didn't have to kill him, all right.
he's not gonna go to the cops. All right? He's a drug dealer.
Yeah, I guess he'll just go to some other dealers and suppliers and that's all we need, is 10 South Americans chasing us for the rest of our lives. Did you touch anything?
I don't think so.
you don't think so? - I don't think so, no!
no, I didn't touch anything! - Think, God damn it, you think!
I don't... I don't like this, Andy! - Did you touch anything?
I don't like... - Shut up! Shut up!
did you touch anything? - No.
are we good?
let's go.
you got the money, chico?
I don't like wasted trips.
you don't look happy.
mind if I call you Groucho?
no, I don't mind.
like what you're seeing? - Yeah, a lot.
stand up. Stand up! - All right, all right.
turn around. - All right, all right, all right.
so how we gonna do this?
gladly pay you the money, got plenty of it.
how do we know you're not gonna bleed us for the next couple of months?
I just want enough to take care of Chris.
that's nice, my brother wouldn't take care of me like that.
Hey, what do you say, Chris, should I trust this guy?
Yes. - Speak up. What?
Yes.
I don't think so.
no, Andy, don't, don't, don't...
what did you say? - No, you can't do that, I won't let you.
you won't let me? - No, no more, you kill her, you're gonna have to kill me.
not such a bad idea.
you know, in fact, it's a pretty good one.
you know I know.
what do you know?
I know.
I'm sorry.
I fucked it all up.
just do it.
do it.
go ahead.
come on.
you'd be doing me a favor.
come on.
get the hell out of here.
get the hell out of here! Go!
go!
Hank! Hank!
move out of the way, move out of the way.
you'll have to move your vehicle. Move out of the way.
Hi, Mr. Hanson.
stick your head in. If he's awake now, you can spend a couple of minutes with him.
dad?
I never meant to hurt her.
I just needed money.
there wasn't supposed to be any gun.
she wasn't supposed to be in the store. Everything just went wrong.
it's okay, Andy.
it's okay.
nurse, the heart monitor cut out for a second.
it does that, don't worry. If it happens again, just press reset.
I have a friend, Deborah, a psychologist who was asked by the city of Philadelphia f she could offer psychological counsellng to Cambodlan refugees and boat people, who had recently arrived in the city.
deborah was daunted by the task. These Cambodians had suffered genocide, starvation, relatives murdered before their eyes and years in refugee camps, harrowing boat trips to the West
how could she relate to their suffering?
how could she help these people?
so guess what all these people wanted to talk about with my friend Deborah, the psychologist.
lt was all that I met this guy in the refugee camp.
l thought he really loved me, but when we got separated...
...he took up wlth my cousin. Now he says he loves me...
...and keeps calling me. They're married now. What should l do?
this is how we are.
may l help you?
l'm Liz Gilbert. l'm writing a magazine article on Bali.
l wanted to meet a medicine man.
everyone said l should meet Ketut Liyer. Am l in the right p ace?
wait.
I mean, here l am with a ninth-generation medicine man and what do l wanna ask him about?
getting closer to God?
saving the world's starving children?
happy to see you. l am Ketut Liyer.
Nope. l wanna discuss my relationship.
you are a world traveler.
you will live a long time...
...have many friends, many experiences.
you will have two marriages. One long, one short.
am l in the long one or the short one?
can't tell.
also you will lose all your money.
l think in next six to 10 months.
don't worry. You will get it back again.
and you will come back to Bali...
...and live here for three or four months and teach me English.
l never had anybody to practice my English with.
and then l will teach you everything I know.
wait.
l have this for you.
keep grounded so it's like you have four egs.
that way, you can stay in this world.
also, no looking at world through your head.
look through your heart instead.
that way, you will know God.
which is why you came here, no?
see you later, alligator.
l proofread all of her manuscripts.
my wife is very, very beautiful, but she can't spell for anything.
look at Uncle Stephen.
and Auntie Liz.
l'm counting the minutes for this to be over so l can get in my big girl pants.
you look fantastic. You just had a baby.
Oh, you're lying. l'm fat, l'm exhausted...
...l can't keep two thoughts. I feel like Liza Minnelli.
Stephen, can you hold Jack?
l'm gonna introduce you to Walter. - Yeah.
Hey, dude, you wanna grab a beer or something?
my new book comes out in April. Thank you for asking.
great. - May.
may. May.
this is Andre. You two are Times most Notable nominees.
so glad to finally meet you. - Nice to finally meet you.
l fed him nachos. ls that bad?
you look comfortable. What'd you fed him, chloroform?
give him to his dad. - l told you, nachos.
know what? l'd be asleep too if had a dump like that.
we'll give him to his mom. - Come here then.
wanna help me change his diaper? - Yes, l do.
Hey, how's the vintage car thing going?
Oh, no, no, no. l changed jobs. l'm a pastry chef now.
you mean you're a baker. - Yeah.
you wanna get baked?
l know, l know.
lt's hard, isn't it?
Oh, no. This is so much fun.
did you know the exact moment you wanted to have a baby?
l can't remember. but l've had the box since before l got married.
what box?
lt's giry and embarrassing, and you'll laugh at me if l tell you.
l will laugh at you, but you still have to tell me.
come on.
under the bed.
l've been filling it with baby things...
...wait Andy was ready to be a father.
so sweet.
does this come in my size?
l have a box just like this, except it's filled with National Geographics and The Times travel section
all the places l wanna see before l die.
Liz, having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face.
you kind of wanna be fully committed.
so my trip to Aruba next week, which is just a basic, you know where to sleep, swim and stuff your face piece
l got a new bikini.
and it turns out, l have unlimited minibar access.
you know what that means? - Jet lag?
you, me...
...macadam a nuts.
that was cute.
you know who l was talking to at the party who was really inspiring was Tara's friend. - Brian.
Brian. Unbelievable. He's a teacher, you know that?
he's a substitute teacher, isn't he?
Yeah. He was talking about the budget outs that are happening now.
there's no money for anything.
there's no music classes, there's no arts classes.
they're volunteering their time to do all of this after school.
they're educating our kids, you know?
l think you'd make a great teacher, honey.
thank you, but l was thinking more of keep education on. Getting my masters, going back to school. l don't know.
you know?
l-- You know...
going back to school. - l'm just think out loud.
I was getting the sinking feeling that Ketut's prophecy was coming true.
was l in the shorter marriage?
we'd only bought this house a year ago.
hadn't l wanted this?
l had actively particlpated in every moment of the creation of this life.
so why didn't l see myself in any of it?
the only thing more impossible than staying was leaving.
I didn't wanna hurt anybody. l wanted to slip quietly out the back door...
...and not stop running until l reached Greenland.
Lnstead, l made a decislon.
to pray.
you know, like, to God.
and it was such a foreign concept to me, that l swear I almost began with:
I'm a big fan of your work.
Hello, God?
nice to finally meet you. l...
l am sorry l've never spoken directly to you before...
...but...
...l hope l've expressed my...
...ample gratitude for all the blessings you've given...
...to me in my life.
l'm in serious trouble.
l don't know what to do.
l need an answer.
please, tell me what to do.
Oh, God, help me, please.
tell me what to do and l'll do it.
go back to bed, Liz.
l don't wanna go to Aruba.
l don't wanna be married.
you know, there's a whole divorce sect on downstairs.
pepper grinder. - She's having a nervous breakdown. - This is what girls do.
she's processing. - Why doesn't she get drunk or laid?
that's what l would do if you left me.
no, you wouldn't.
no, l wouldn't. - She moved out, she filed for divorce.
they were together eight years. She's got no home.
legacy.
every word in ltalian is like a truffle. A magic trick.
honey, l get it. lt's your life raft right now.
when Andy and l broke up for two weeks, l bought a loom.
a frigging loom. And he tried to start a microbrewery.
l don't know how you guys aren't sick of me now. l'm sick of me.
are you kidding me? We love having you.
lt's kind of like having a writer in residence.
but you are a writer. You should be writing something.
maybe l could write about a woman who goes to ltaly to learn ltalian.
call it Carbohydrates and Conjugations.
l'll start looking for a place.
l'm fall in love with you. - l'm not who you think l am.
l'm just your fantasy.
no, that's bull shit. You're real.
your scars, your talent.
the fact that l own a piece-of-crap bar...
...and you accept that that's all l'm gonna do.
okay, this sucks.
l second that. - Don't be rude.
l love your pain.
and l love that when we're together, l can make it go away.
Oh, he's good. - You're love...
he's hot, there's a difference. - ...is like a hot panini.
and when l look into your eyes, l hear dolphins clapp.
l did not write that line.
here's what he doesn't know yet.
l disappear into the person l love.
l am the permeable membrane. lf l love you, you can have it all.
my money, my time, my body...
...my dog, my dog's money.
l will assume your debts and project upon you...
...all sorts of nifty qualities you've never actually cultivated in yourself.
l will give you all this and more...
...until l am so exhausted and depleted...
...the only way l can recover...
... is by becoming infatuated with someone else.
Elizabeth, hi. - Hi.
Oh, really?
how you doing?
Cheers.
thank you. - l owe you an apology.
for the walkouts. - Well, l'm not everyone's cup of tea.
l doubt that.
l, on the other hand, was shit.
athough l was try very hard. - " Shit " is a strong word.
thank you.
you seem shorter in person than on the stage.
Really? l hear that a lot. - Sorry.
lt's okay.
lt's unnerving when a total stranger sees you more clearly than you see yourself.
that's what l mean by saying you're short.
are you hearing dolphins clapping right now?
l took a few liberties with your material.
l give you full permiss on making fun of me. l know you're dying to.
you're far too charming to make fun of.
l'm still hearing them.
ls that your guru?
you're joking, but, yes, it is.
she's beautiful.
Yeah. A friend told me about her.
l was out of work and feel pretty desperate for something.
not the last time l was out of work, the time before that.
and l just had this feeling like l was looking in all the wrong places.
looking for what?
God.
she has an ashram in lndia. l'm dying to go, but...
...you know, you have to get, like, three stages of hepatitis shots...
...and my insurance always runs out.
l'll go when the time's right.
there's a gathering of her students every morning.
lf you want, l could take you sometime.
lf you're not unnerved by 100 crunchy people chanting in Sanskrit.
l need to be unnerved.
David. A yogi from Yonkers.
l didn't exactly fall in love with the guy.
what happened was I drove out of my marriage...
...and into David's arms...
...exactly the same way a cartoon circus performer...
...dives off a high platform and into a small cup of water...
...vanishing completely.
your underwear, my queen.
he just folded my delicates.
Oh, my God, baby, you are in so much trouble.
Thirty-six?
my client is simply not interested in a divorce.
ls he serious?
ls he really representing himself?
one semester of law school right here, baby.
great. Well, what would it take to interest your client?
okay, so here's the deal. You have screwed up my life...
...but what l wanna know is why couldn't you find yourself in our marriage? Why didn't you say what you were thinking?
l did. You never listened to me. - No. You never said:
'hey, you know what? You suck. l'm deeply unhappy. "
you just took off. You never gave me a chance to address those problems.
that's not fair. That's just quitting. l took vows.
till death. And take them seriously.
l believe this is just a phase and l'm wiling to wait it out.
you are always waiting, Stephen.
waiting for me to come home, to wanna have kids...
...to make you dinner. l don't know why we can't accept...
...we don't wanna live in unhappiness anymore.
l accept the fact that l am occasionally unreliable...
...and often get distracked, but l thought you liked that about me.
l thought it was okay that l had hopes and dreams.
have a dream. Stephen, great, fine. Do that. Just pick one.
okay, l pick one. l pick you.
l know this is awful.
but l believe with every molecule of my body that you will find the person that wants just what you want.
that will give you what you want and what you deserve. l'm not her.
well, you obviously know nothing about what l want.
my client would like to submit a song he wrote...
...that he believes is relevant to these proceedings. Goes something ike this:
are you kidding?
quitter, quitter, quitter!
how about l take the blame? l am the one who couldn't deal...
...with another weekend roaming some box-shaped superstore...
...buying appliances on credit...
...and pretending to be a couple that neither one of us ever knew how to be.
you wanted that toaster.
you like faking it, fine. You're stellar. l'm the failure. l suck at faking it.
lt was not my finest hour. - So where do things stand now?
we're prepared to offer half of everything...
...and my client's retirement accounts.
take it all then. Everything.
he still said no.
he hates me now. - He doesn't hate you.
his heart is broken.
l think he hates you.
l'm never letting you out of the basement.
why don't we talk next week and we'll see where things stand?
okay. - These things have a way of working themselves out.
so why'd you become a vegetarian?
l saw some cows slaughtered one time.
bare you touched your dinner.
he's 28.
this is hard for him, isn't it? And you?
the meditations help.
you remember a couple of years ago, when you threw yourself into the renovation of your kitchen? You were consumed with being the perfect wife and cook.
l was trying to make it work.
well, l think chanting and meditation is the same thing...
... in a different costume.
definitely give me that documentary.
I've been thinking about vegetarianism.
my triglycerides are through the roof.
Yeah. Thanks for everything.
great to meet you.
what? - Nothing. it's just...
...you know, you used to look like Stephen.
now you kind of look like David.
you know?
what l meant was, you know how people start resembling their dogs?
why would he say that, we look like the same dog?
he was joking. - Not funny.
well, he had five Heinekens. He was bombed.
well, not funny.
we don't look like the same dog.
lf anything, you're a collie and l'm a Tibetan mastiff.
don't you wanna give me a chance to miss you?
lt begins when the object of your affection...
...bestows upon you a heady hallucinogenic dose...
...of something you've never even dared to admit you wanted...
...an emotiona speedba of thunderous love and excitement.
soon you start craving that attention with the hungry obsession of any junkie.
when it's withheld, you turn sick, crazy, not to mention resentful ...
...of the dealer who encouraged this addiction in the first place...
...but now refuses to pony up the good stuff.
just frustrated, l'm concerned. l don't understand.
what don't you get?
what's going on? You don't look me in the eye.
you don't finish your-- - Nobody's asking you to make the bed!
you don't have sex with me! - Sometimes l'm not in the mood!
God damn him, and he used to give it to you for free.
next stage finds you skinny, shak in a corner...
...certain only that you'd sell your soul...
...just to have that one thing one more time.
well, then why don't we discuss it? Why don't we sort it?
why don't we act like adults? - Okay. Can I have a little space?
how about that? - Meanwhile...
...the object of your adoration is now repulsed by you.
you don't always make me miserable. - There's a comfort.
l just-- Sometimes l need to come home...
...and have a little David time.
he looks at you like someone he's never met before.
ls that okay? - Yeah. No, it's fine.
and not have to, like, you know, justify it.
the irony is you can hardly blame him.
l mean, check yourself out. You're a mess.
unrecognizable even to your own eyes.
you asked me to come here? Here l am.
and it turned into something else.
didn't it? - You are such a child.
right. l can't take this anymore. - Great. Perfect.
that's a great response to a conversation.
goddamn it.
you have now reached infatuation's final destination.
the complete and merciless devaluation of self.
you wanna go away for a year?
do you know what l felt when l woke up, Della?
nothing. No passion, no spark, no faith, no heat. Absolutely nothing.
l've gotten past the point where l can be calling this a bad moment.
and it just terrifies me. Jesus, this is like worse than death to me...
...the idea that this is the person l'm gonna be from now on.
this happens to people.
they fall in love in their 20s, get married...
...do the granite countertop, white-picket fence in their 30s...
...and somewhere they realize, " This is not for me. "
so they fail and they fall down, they hurt like hell, they straighten up...
...and march their asses to the shrink's office.
they can't just check out. - l am not checking out.
l need to change.
you have a support system here, Liz.
you have friends and family who love you.
and do you feel my love for you? My support for you? No.
there's, like, nothing. l have no pulse.
l am going to ltaly. - ltaly. Why ltaly?
what did you have for lunch? - l don't know. A salad.
exactly. l used to have this appetite for food, for my life...
...and it is just gone.
I wanna go someplace where l can marvel at something.
language, gelato, spaghetti, something.
you're talking ike a college kid. - l've been acting like one.
since l was 15, l've either been with a guy or breaking up with a guy.
l have not given myself two weeks of a breather...
...to just deal with, you know, myself.
what's going on with you and David?
what, did you fall out?
l don't know how to be here.
you wanna know how to be here? Stop constantly waiting for something.
l'm going to ltaly and then l'm going to David's guru's ashram in lndia...
...and l'm go to end the year in Bali.
that's what l'm gonna do.
that's harder to argue with. The beaches are nice. But why?
Ketut told me l would. - Guy with no teeth.
when you're desperate...
...and some guy who, yes, looks a little like Yoda...
...hands you a prophecy, you have to respond.
do you need a xanax? - Aways.
okay, l'm just gonna say it. l'm gonna say it and be done with it.
what if it doesn't work ?
my whole life fits in a 12-foot-square box.
you know how many times l hear that in a day?
most of them never come back for their whole life.
Hello? - Liz.
good news. Stephen just signed the divorce papers.
l'll probably be back in a week, penniless with dysentery.
you're my hero.
Hey.
lf you stay, we' ll go out for lndian every night.
you never asked me to stay.
go, go, go.
you know what's funny?
this is the first time in my life there's no one wait at home for me.
l don't even have a home to come back to.
Oh, God. You'll make friends.
you'll make friends with a backpack, of course.
lt would be great to get away.
Andy and l were talking about getting a little villa in Florence for a month.
you know, and in 10 years, when Jack is older...
what?
you know why l was giving you such a hard time?
l love my job, my guy and my kid, but...
l wish l could go.
l love you and l'm proud of you.
now go.
there is a wonderful old ltalian joke...
...about a poor man who goes to church every day...
...and prays before the statue of a great saint, begging:
"dear saint, please, please, please let me win the lottery. "
Flnally, the exasperated statue comes to life...
...and looks down at the begging man and says.
"my son, please, please, please buy a ticket. "
so now l get the joke.
and l've got three tickets.
you heat the water on the stove.
so if l want to bathe...?
you put the water in the tub.
okay.
Yeah. It doesn't really seem like enough water to bathe in.
not enough.
Yes, it's enough.
fill it up three, four, five times.
everything that's important gets cleaned.
ls this safe? This...
...scaffolding? Scaffol
lt holds up the ceiling.
otherwise it will fall apart.
everything falls apart, my dear.
the only thing permanent in life is family.
you're not married.
no, divorced.
why divorced?
we broke it.
you're more happy now?
l have one rule.
no strange men spending the night.
you American girls when you come to ltaly...
...all you want s pasta...
...and sausage.
l'll take it.
good. You chose well.
cappuccino.
lt's a zoo in here. - And my ltalian sucks.
how long have you been here? - Two weeks. You?
six weeks. You'll get better.
two cappuccinos, please.
and warm the milk this time.
yesterday it was too hot and burned my tongue.
you like Napoleons? - Of course.
and two Napoleons, please.
your ltalian is fantastic.
l have a wonderful tutor. l'll give you his number if you like.
he's really good and he needs work. - Oh, great.
are you Dutch? German?
Swedish. Even colder people, if you can imagine.
l'm Liz, by the way. - Sof.
you can say:
lt's past.
too fast, but okay.
you can say:
Yeah.
what a beautiful word.
come on, " let's cross over. " lt's so ordinary.
no, it's the perfect combination of ltalian sounds.
lt's the wistful " ah, " the rolling trill.
that's true. - l love it.
all right, let me teach you a word.
therapist.
therapist.
come on. - Good. You gotta learn humor.
lt's not. - Come on. Cheers.
shall we continue Tuesday at 5? - Yes.
with another bottle of the therapy? - Of course.
you're doing very well, Liz. - Thank you.
and you must be very polite with yourself when you learn something new.
Yes. Grazie, l agree.
but your English-- How are you even talk to me like this right now?
l think you're gonna teach me more than l teach you.
you have good ltalian. Very good.
all right.
l am a one.
I feel so guilty. l've been in Rome for three weeks...
...all l've done is learn a few ltalian words and eat.
you feel guilty because you're American.
you don't know how to enjoy yourself.
l beg your pardon? - lt's true.
americans know entertainment, but don't know pleasure.
this is Luca Spaghetti, by the way, you know.
your name is Luca Spaghetti?
Yes, that's what our family is called.
we invented it. l'm serious. Listen to me.
you want to know your problem? Americans.
you work too hard. You get burned out.
then you come home and spend the whole weekend in your pajamas in front of the TV.
that's not far off, actually.
but you don't know pleasure. You have to be told you've learned it.
you see a commercial that says, " lt's Miller time " ...
...and you say, " That's right. Now l will go to buy a six-pack. "
and drink the whole thing and wake up the next morning and you feel terrible.
but an ltalian doesn't need to be told.
he w ks by a sign that says, " you deserve a break today " ...
...and he says, " Yeah, l know."
that's why l'm planning on taking a break at noon to go over to your house and sleep with your wife.
lt means the sweetness of doing nothing. We are masters of it.
he's right. He says you can't learn ltalian like this.
you don't speak the language just with your mouth, speak it with your hands.
like this?
okay. ls yelling.
that meal was excellent.
suck it.
all this gives me a stomachache.
screw you.
l think that's my neighbor Lorenzo. - Charming.
another way to say "screw you."
so anyway, to start off l'd say...
excuse me.
come here.
for the table...
...a big platter of artichoke alla giudia...
...prosciutto with melon...
...and eggplant with ricotta affumicata.
then spaghetti alla carbonara...
...pappardelle with ragu of rabbit...
...and linguini with clams.
then tripe alla romana...
...and saltimbocca.
and two more liters of the vino sfuso from Genzano.
thank you.
you did it. Yes.
Liz Gilbert, you are a Roman woman now.
no, only honorary.
that is a real Roman woman.
Yeah, with a lot of international friends.
that one, l'd bite.
maybe you and Rome just have different words.
different words? - Yeah.
Yeah. lt's like each city has a word, if you really think about it.
like, what is the word for London?
l would say " stuffy " .- I would agree with that.
what's the word for Stockholm? - Are you kidding? " Conform " .
and New York?
"Ambition " or " soot " .
what's the word for Rome?
lt's kind of difficult to think about.
lt's classic.
sex " .
of course.
so, what's your word, Liz? l'm curious. can't figure it out.
well...
lt might be...
lt started as " daughter " . l was good at that. And then " wife " . not so good.
not so good.
my word's " writer " .
Yeah, but that's what you do. That isn't who you are, no?
maybe you're a woman in search of her word.
Hey, Sofi, it's Liz. Let's go to Naples. Maybe my word is "pizza " .
listen, lady, l am only 7, but l can tell you're a complete moron...
...because l am from Naples.
l love this place, but Giovanni said to watch out.
his cousin got mugged here in a museum.
are you serious? - Watch out for the scooter. Yeah.
l'm in love. I'm having a relationship with my pizza.
you look like you're break up with the pizza. What's the matter?
l can't.
what do you mean, you can't? This is pizza in Napoli.
lt is your moral imperative to eat that pizza.
l want to, but l've gained, like, 10 pounds.
l mean, l've got this...
right here. What's it called? What's the word?
a muffin top.
l have one too.
l unbuttoned my jeans five minutes ago just look at this.
let me ask you a question.
ln all the years you've ever undressed in front of a gentleman...
hasn't been that many. - All right, well ...
...has he ever asked you to leave?
has he ever walked out? Left? - No.
because he doesn't care.
he's in a room with a naked girl. He's won the lottery.
l'm so tired of saying no and then waking up in the morning...
...and recalling every single thing l ate the day before.
counting every calorie so l know exactly...
...how much self-loathing to take into the shower.
l'm going for it.
l have no interest in being obese. l'm just through with the guilt.
this is what l'm gonna do. l'm gonna finish this pizza...
...and then we're gonna go watch the soccer game.
and tomorrow we're gonna go on a little date...
...and buy ourselves some bigger jeans.
giovanni likes a muffin.
Attagirl.
he's saying, " For whom are you playing? "
for whom.
pull, pull. l'm sucking it in.
put some Swedish muscle into this.
you think this happened to Sophia Loren?
there it goes. Almost got it.
go, go, go. You're not trying.
l've almost got it. l've almost got it. l did it.
Oh, that's beautiful. You should get it.
for whom?
for you, Liz. Just for you.
no, l'm happy just with my big lady pants.
thanks for the day. And the leg room.
lt was fun.
we're gonna go for food. Wanna come?
no. No, l'm good.
the sweetness of doing nothing.
please. Please get off the floor.
will you please just...? Will you come up here?
what if we just acknowledge that we have a screwed-up relationship...
...and we stick it out anyway?
we accept that we fight a ot...
...and we hardly have sex anymore...
...but that we don't wanna live without each other.
and that way we can spend our lives together...
...miserable...
...but happy not to be apart.
dear David.
we haven't had any communication in a while...
...and it's given me time l needed to think.
remember when you said we should Iive with each other and be unhappy...
...so we could be happy?
consider it a testimony to how much l love you...
...that l spent so long pouring myself into that offer...
...trying to make it work.
but a friend took me to the most amazing place the other day.
it's called the Augusteum.
Octavian Augustus built it to house his remains.
when the barbarians came, they trashed it along with everything else.
the great Augustus, Rome's first true great emperor...
...how could he have imagined that Rome...
...the whole world, as far as he was concerned, would be in ruins?
during the Dark Ages, someone came in here and stole the emperor's ashes.
in the 12th century, it became a fortress...
...then a bullring.
they stored fireworks in here after that.
nowadays, it's a bathroom for the homeless...
...so you better watch your step going down.
lt's one of the quietest and loneliest places in Rome.
the city has grown up around it over centuries.
lt feels like a precious wound...
...like a heartbreak you won't let go of because it hurts too good.
l like it messy.
we all want things to stay the same, David.
l guess the guy before me must've been some angel, huh?
settle for living in misery...
...because we're afraid of change, of things crumbling to ruins.
then l looked around in this place, at the chaos it's endured...
...the way it's been adapted, burned, pillaged...
...then found a way to build itself back up again, and l was reassured.
maybe my life hasn't been so chaotic. lt's just the world that is...
...and the only real trap is getting attached to any of it.
ruin is a gift.
ruin is the road to transformation.
you ready?
Yeah.
even in this eternal city, the Augusteum showed me that we must always be prepared for endless waves of transformation.
both of us deserve better than staying together...
...because we're afraid we'll be destroyed if we don't.
my mother's stuffing. Stale bread, walnuts, got those.
will you get me some more potatoes?
Oh, l'm always getting you more potatoes.
lt's my dream, a real American Thanksgiving.
the perfect way to say goodbye to our Liz.
so...
...you leave this week, huh? - Yes.
and where are you going? lran?
lndia.
Liz is making us an American meal tonight.
you are not married, yeah? - No.
what's wrong with your friend, is she a lesbian?
no, Mama, she's not a lesbian. And she understands ltalian.
how's she going to find another husband and start a family when she's on the other side of the world?
lf a man said, " l'm going to travel for a year and meet wonderful people... "
but she's not a man.
lt's more difficult for a woman to feel that she has the right to make choices.
lt takes a lot of courage. - Exactly.
you call it courage, l call t stupidity.
mama, enough.
l know a number of people who would agree with you.
what time will the turkey be ready?
the turkey...
l haven't defrosted it yet.
Oh, shit.
you only had one thing to do and you screwed it up.
l was distracted! lt can happen!
too much good food!
too many women!
and l forgot!
now, before we eat, everyone...
...it is Thanksgiving, so let us give thanks.
Yeah. Come on, join hands. - Okay.
so we just say what we...
what we thank God for tonight. Sofi, why don't you start?
l am grateful for you, Liz...
...for helping me appreciate life with all that comes with it muffin tops and bad times.
and for Giovanni...
...for making me feel...
...loved and secure.
and Giulio.
me, I'm grateful for my beautiful family.
my two little daughters and my wife.
l thank God and the Holy Virgin...
...for this very, very special day.
and for this beautiful family...
...that today is so much bigger.
very much bigger.
l thank you all for this new custom of celebration.
and Liz's stuffing...
...and God...
...for my sexiness.
and you, Ruffina?
l thank God for...
...my sexiness.
go ahead. Giovanni.
l thank God for...
...fear...
...because for the first time...
...l'm afraid the person next to me...
...will be the one who wants to leave.
well, this all makes me so grateful.
seeing all you happy people who know how to love each other and take care of each other.
l look at the amazing women l've met who l admire so much...
...and the great men, taking care of their women...
...and putting their children to bed.
l just feel happy to see it and to be part of it.
l'm the luckiest girl in the world.
lt's a good breakfast, huh?
l will take this to your room.
lt has already started.
l fell asleep. - Yeah. Pity.
probably the only person in the world who ever fell asleep during meditation.
this leads to the meditation garden. - ls the guru here?
she's always here. - l know, but is she " here " here?
she's at her ashram in New York.
but l came from New York to see her here.
sounds ike one of her little tricks.
the meditation cave.
lt's open 24/7 and it's air-conditioned.
this is Liz Gilbert. - Hi. Nice to meet you.
where did you get that button? - They sell them in the bookstore.
that is exact y what l need. l need something like that. l don't listen.
l never have. My mom used to call me Little Miss Chatty Cathy...
...because l just ramble. l am a rambler.
l am rambling now. l'm sorry.
silence is a wonderful spiritual practice...
...but if Corella could speak, she'd tell you it's more challenging than it looks.
wait till you've been here for a while. - Okay.
thank you, Corella. l'll be sure to tell her.
what did she say? - No idea.
change into your work clothes. l'll take you to your seva.
lt's a Hindu word for " selfless devotional work " .
lt's required of everyone who stays. - Okay. Thank you.
ls there anything in this world skinnier than an lndian teenage boy?
l'm Tulsi. - Liz.
where are you from?
the next town. My parents have been devotees of the guru for many years.
we spend a lot of time here.
but...
...they are trying to marry me off. That's the custom.
that's not what you want? - No way. lt sucks.
l want to study psychology, just as our guru did when she attended college.
l prefer to be with God than boys my age.
no one in my family understands my coming all the way to India.
do you ever look at them and wonder, " What am l doing in this family? "
you have no idea.
the Guru Gita is an ancient text 182 verses long.
ln it, the goddess Parvati is asking Shiva, or God...
...for the secrets of fulfillment.
lt's said to have transform qualities.
l would just like to take a risk here and say...
me and Guru Gita, we just do not get along.
what is it you have trouble with? - Everything.
lt's long, it's tedious, l can't keep up...
...and l get these insane anxieties about everything in my life...
...and l've lost my place.
sounds like it has a positive effect if you're having such strong emotions and physical reactions.
you keep trying.
lt is most commendable that you ended your marriage.
you seem like such a happy, free person now.
l think my ex-husband would describe me as selfish.
you mustn't be angry with yourself or disappointed.
you don't have to make children or be married to have a family.
Oh, man. They got mosquitoes here big enough...
...to stand flat-footed and screw a chicken.
l love you. - Liz, have you met...
...Richard from Texas? - Hello, Richard from Texas.
nice to meet you, Groceres. - Groceries?
Yeah. Yeah, l heard you eating before l saw you.
l never seen anybody eat so much at one time.
you sure do enjoy your Groceres.
you know, it's been a rough day, and if no one takes it personally...
...l'm going to take my large meal someplace else to eat it in silence.
Oh, no, stay. l'm done.
looked like you were working through some pretty rough stuff this morning.
stuff with your ex-husband?
l got an ex-wife.
she thinks l changed my name to " Motherfucker " .
l
l just spent some time in Rome and l came here feeling so great.
and now here l am, at the source and l feel more disconnected than ever.
why'd you come here?
l just want some peace.
peace?
you wanna get to the castle, Groceries...
...you got to swim the moat.
here, you can finish that. l know you can.
okay.
simply empty your mind.
breathe.
what am l going to do when this year is over?
where am I going to live?
well, maybe Chicago.
Oh, my God. I could build a meditation room
no. Stop thinking. Why is this so hard?
screw you, Corella. How the hell does she do this?
she looks like frigging Mother Teresa.
Oh, my God, kill me.
who's in the moat today? - Shut up.
sounds like you wrestled some big-ass crocs.
you know what? lf you're so goddamn smart, what are you doing here?
lf you're here, it makes you smart already.
do you wanna talk about what--? - No, not to you. Thank you.
l'm the only one here. You're gonna talk about it sooner or later.
l cannot focus in there.
all I think about is my meditation room and how to decorate.
are you shitting me?
are you kidding me?
the meditation room is within, Groceries. Decorate that.
do you always talk in bumper sticker?
l do, and here's another one.
you have to learn to select your thoughts the way you select your clothes every day. That's a power you can cultivate.
you wanna come here and control your life so bad, work on the mind.
that's the only thing you should control.
lf you can't master your thoughts, you're in trouble.
l am trying.
Yeah, hello, that's the damn problem. Stop trying. Surrender.
go out into the garden and just sit there and still your mind...
...and you watch what happens.
why don't you just let it be?
has anyone ever told you you look like James Taylor?
every day.
God, he really does.
my prayers were always the same.
please, God, please. Open my heart, send me a sign...
...because we both know l ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. "
look at you, floating through Calcutta.
looks like you had a great meditation.
l probably have malaria now.
the bites will go away.
eventually everything goes away.
you ever done that, Groceries? Begged for a sign?
that sounds vaguely familiar.
be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.
what s your problem?
did you fall in love with the wrong woman or something?
excuse me, Miss Gilbert.
you have a phone call.
how's the Guru Gita treating you?
fine. You'd like her.
did you get my e-mail?
Yeah. l'm sorry l didn't call sooner.
why didn't you?
because if l didn't respond...
...we were still having a conversation. l was still in it.
l'm sorry. We were just bad timing.
l just wanted things to be easy. We were good when things were easy.
lt's not that l need easy right now. l just can't have so hard.
well, you sound good.
stronger.
so do you.
Yeah, well , l'm an actor, Liz.
l got a part.
it's off-Broadway, but it's pretty cool.
l'm happy for you.
all right.
well, l' ll see you around.
check you out.
l have never seen you so focused.
you need a Thums Up.
no, no. No lips on the bottle.
first rule in lndia is never touch anything but yourself.
Oh, good God. That's, like, five times sweeter than Coke.
l think it might have methamphetamines in it.
we can only hope.
l know you feel awful.
but your life's changing.
that's not a bad thing.
and you're in the perfect place for it. Surrounded by grace.
l thought l was over him, but...
...l love him.
big deal.
so you fell in love with someone. - l really miss him.
so miss him.
send him some light and love every time you think of him, then drop it.
you know, if you could clear out all that space in your mind that you're using to obsess over this guy and your failed marriage, you'd have a vacuum with a doorway.
and you know what the universe would do with that doorway?
rush in. God would rush in .
fill you with more love than you ever dreamed of. Man.
l think you have the capacity someday to ove the whole world.
what do they sell over there?
Ganesh. Remover of obstacles.
l'm gonna need a lot of these.
speaking of elephants, there's a rogue elephant on the loose in the area.
he was with carnival.
they say he is very, very unpredictable.
that just makes him more attractive to her.
how'd you get to be so smart? l'll bet it was the hard way.
don't change the subject.
well, when is this grieving phase going to pass?
you want a day on a calendar you can circle?
can you give me one? - No. You got to do the work.
meditate and go to seva...
...and most important, get your butt down to the geet every morning...
...and something'll change.
l just cannot get through the Guru Gita. l can't find that feeling of devotion.
okay. Devotion's love. Pick somebody or something you wanna devote it to.
lt doesn't have to be the guru. lt's all the same to her.
this is about you.
can l tell you something, Groceries? You got some serious control issues.
ls it obvious?
all right, Richard, get out from inside my head now.
shut the door.
that's him? - That's him.
he's hideous. - No, he's not. He's cute.
he's a Sagittarius.
he studies computer programming in Delhi.
he has very good grades.
and his family is very, very wealthy.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the dance floor...
...for their very first couples dance, Liz and Stephen.
my people.
are you ready? - l'm ready.
you look beautiful. - Thank you.
l married a hottie.
what is that? That's not our song. - No, it is not.
baby, that's not our song.
definitely not. - Everybody's looking at us.
lt's okay. l'm gonna go talk to the guy. lt's gonna be fine.
l told you l'd get it. - This is taking care of it?
l owe you a wedding gift. l didn't know what was appropriate.
l wanted to tell you l've been dedicating my "Guru Gita" to you.
lmagining you happy is what got me through it.
what did it look like when I was happy?
l imagine you and Rijul smiling and looking at each other,
...with love and kindness.
lt seemed very real.
thank you so much, Liz.
that helps me to believe it as well.
thinking about your own wedding?
Yeah, me too.
the funny thing about weddings, you end up thinking about yourself.
did you throw yourself a big shindig? Big, white, floppy dress?
Yep. l arranged it all. Nobody forced me into anything.
Yeah. And now you can't forgive yourself.
honestly, l'm waiting for him to forgive me.
to release me.
waiting for him to forgive you is a damn waste of time, Groceries.
forgive yourself.
lt's not that easy.
Yeah.
good night, Richard.
follow me. - l'm tired.
get your butt up here.
lt's not a pretty story, but it's pretty classic.
too much alcohol, too many drugs, too much mindless cheating.
just regret.
ocean of regret.
l lost everything.
my pride, my job.
my family.
l lost my family.
one day after work, l stopped off at a bar and l got shitfaced.
l was a lot like you, you know.
l was just- l don't know. l thought too much, l felt too...
l wanted to feel nothing.
l should've called a cab, but l didn't.
l just got in my car and l drove home.
my little boy...
he was 8 years old at the time. He was...
he was sitting in the driveway with his little Hot Wheels,
waiting for his lost, drunk, miserable dad...
to come home and play with him.
l didn't see him.
l didn't. l just roared into that driveway and l didn't see my little boy.
but he-- No, he...
he got out of the way.
he was used to getting out of the way when l was around.
and l, You know, l don't...
l don't know. l don't remember a thing.
next day, l woke up and they were gone.
my wife had been watching what happened out the window.
she just wasn't gonna...
she just wasn't gonna do it anymore.
so...
he's 18 now.
he's in school and, oh, God, he's so smart.
God, he's so funny and he's...
he's so sweet.
l missed it all.
l missed my son's growing up. Just missed it.
come here.
here's the deal.
you're gonna stay here till you forgive yourself.
you hear me?
everything else will take care of itself.
ls this where you forgave yourself?
l'm trying, Elizabeth.
l am trying.
Hey.
l believe this is the song they were supposed to play at our wedding.
l did love you, Stephen.
l know.
but l still love you.
so love me.
but l miss you.
so miss me.
send me love and light every time you think of me, then drop it.
lt won't last forever.
nothing does.
Bye-bye. - Goodbye, Mr. Richard.
l'll see you.
now that you're going, who is gonna kick my ass every day?
Oh, l'd stay till a monsoon swept me away if l could. Bye-bye.
but you've got bills to pay and houses to build.
you just keep doing the work and move on with your life, will you?
the man is getting on a plane and you're still bossing me.
l've got your whole list: move on, use mosque to repellent and...
l don't know. There were some other things. l wrote them down.
go back to Texas, Richard.
well, l ain't getting any prettier standing here.
so l'm off.
Hey, Groceries.
believe in love again.
Liz. Liz, l've just taken my badge off today.
l've done so well. Four weeks of silence. lt was so dull.
but it's like a facelift, because your face...
...you know, just relaxes and your throat just drops down. It's a bargain.
we've got so much to catch up on.
Oh, go yes. Good for you. You will get so much out of that.
and your throat will look amazing as well.
excuse me, Elizabeth.
they're asking you to report to the seva office after dinner if you don't mind.
we're taking you off the floor-scrubbing team.
there are about 50 devotees arriving tomorrow from all over the world for a 10-day retreat,
and we'd like you to be the key hostess.
we ask that you don't take part during the meditations.
we need you to watch over the flock, make sure everyone is all right.
we care the person who does this job Little Suzy Cream Cheese.
you need to be social and bubbly and smiling all the time.
madam, l'm your girl.
so just find your suitcase, it should be here somewhere...
...and then head down the path to your room.
so the holy truth of the whole adventure here in lndia is in one line:
God dwells within you as you.
God's not interested in watching a performance of how a spiritual person looks and behaves.
the quiet girl who glides silently through the place...
...with a gentle, ethereal smile, who is that person?
that's lngrid Bergman in The Bells of St. Mary's, not me.
God dwells within me as me.
child tormented by demon.
lt looks like teething.
same thing.
your turn.
Hello, Ketut.
l'm very happy to meet you.
you are a world traveler.
no, l came to see you about a year ago.
you girl from California? - No, l girl from New York.
don't remember.
well, you told me l should come back here to Bali.
you said l could help you with your English...
...and you would teach me the things that you know.
you gave me this.
you. You. l remember you.
Oh, good. - You sad girl from New York.
Yes. - You Liss. You came back.
l came back. - You, you, you.
me, me, me.
so long ago we meet.
last time, you have too much worry, too much sorrow.
last time, you look like sad old woman.
now you pretty.
why so different? - Well ...
...a lot of things, really.
but l was in Rome for four months, just feeding myself,
and then l went to live at an ashram in lndia.
now, we put together.
exactly. That's why l'm here.
Ketut good for that. - What'd you give him?
do you still want me to help you with your English?
english later, Liss.
first, better idea.
how old are these?
from grandfather. Very important spells.
also mantras, cures.
thousand years' worth.
all l have, all l know, right here.
you copy for me?
Absolutely. l can go to town and take these...
no. You don't take.
you copy here, better, Liss.
l take a nap now. l'm very old.
how old are you, Ketut?
one hundred and one, or maybe 64.
don't remember.
this is gonna take me the rest of my life.
he make you pretty, find you husband, you work hard for him.
that's exactly opposite of why l'm here.
everybody need husband.
would you mind getting me water?
no.
fine. Keep making copies. l get water.
so, Liz, the Balinese believe that Bali's the center of the universe.
and here we are in the center of Bali.
you got the one bedroom, got your fish pond.
you got your own meditation temple.
l tell you, since the bombing, tourism's been way down...
...so l can give you this place at a very, very good price right now.
paradise.
l'll take it. - People in Bali understand,
in order to stay happy, must always know where you are every moment.
right here is perfect balance. Right at meeting of heaven and earth.
not too much God, not too much selfish.

because you drank a little bit too much last night.
and here it is. Very delicious, as you can see and very tasty.
do you make it a habit of walking into people's houses?
do you make it a habit of sleeping with your front door open?
lt's a call. Moment.
Hello, darling. How are you? - Can't get the coffee machine to work.
okay. l've told you 50 times. lt's very easy.
you change the filter, you add the coffee...
...you add water and that's it. How did you get into college?

l have to go. - Who is she? ls she hot?
Jesus, she's hot. - Dad, if you hang up...
...l'll call back and embarrass you.
dad, don't.
that's a lot of " darlings, " darling.
Yeah. That darling was my son.
l've called all my children " darling " since they were little.
then there was a moment that between the pets and the children...
...l was confused, so l called everybody " darling. "
okay, you need to rest.
here is my number and my address.
l'm gonna leave it here on the table, in case you need a tour guide.
a tour guide.

lt's gonna be helpful.
Hey, Mr. Tour Guide.
can we start with a coffee?
okay.
what are these?
these are rambutan. They're delicious.
it's like an orange made love to a plum. Would you like some?
when you put it that way, yes, thank you.
excuse me.
what is that?
no, no, no.
they taste like dirty feet.
Really? - Dirty feet.
they taste like feet.
look out. Nice. How many places have you visited?
l have 46 stamps on my passport.
l happen to have 49 stamps on my passport.
forty-nine? l knew it. - Yes.
knew what? - l knew it.
we are both antevaslns, my dear.
what is that?
Antevasln is... lt's an in-between.
lt is the one who lives by the border...
because they renounce to the comfort of family life in order to seek " enlightment. "
l like your word.
and l like the way you say " enlightment. "
'Enlightment. " l try.
you're missing a syllable, but l like it.
lt's beautiful, no?
it's Pura Melanting, which means " Temple of Prosperity. "
beautiful. - Yup.
so next attraction of the tour? - Yes.
food from Bali. - Oh, good. l'm starving.
where should we go? - To the best restaurant in town.
of course. - My place.
subtle.
did you always live in Brazil before you came to Bali?
no, no. Only for 20 years.
then l met my wife and l moved with her to Australia.
she traveled a lot because of the job.
and l stayed home with the children. - A good feminist husband.
Yeah. Yeah. Didn't turn out to be what she wanted, l'm afraid.
what happened? - What happened?
well, the children were grown.
and l run an import-export jewelry business, so l could live anywhere.
and Bali seemed like the perfect place to recover from a divorce.
and here l am. Here l am.
and you? - Well, far less tragic.
we were immature and really too young to get married. We grew apart.
hearts were broken.
Yes.
then it's the same.
this is just perfect.
so are you.
you know what you are? You're a falsa magra.
you know what that is? - What?
you are slender and elegant in a distance,
but up close, you are round and fleshy.
thank God for Brazilians.
stop that!
you are a world traveler.
he says that to everyone.
already make your money.
you don't have young-man ambition.
he's good. - You have three children.
two. That's a callous.
and you have divorce.
very difficult.
you loved her very much.
you haven't healed that wound.
now you are scared to open your heart.
you are afraid hurt will happen to you again.
only way to heal is to trust.
this okay. To have broken heart mean you have tried for something.
ls it going to be broken again?
he a good man, Liz. You need a good man.
thank you.
true. Ketut knows.
l am so sick of people telling me l need a man.
you don't need a man, Liz. You need a champion.
some spring break, huh? - Come on. You're moving like turtles.
his enthusiasm is exhausting.
try being dropped off at school when you're 10,
and having your father kiss you on the mouth.
he still does it.
l'm sure it's all normal in Brazil, but I didn't grow up in Brazil.
friends would tease the orap out of me.
why didn't you ask him to stop?
no, l did at first,
but then l realized how happy it made the old guy and l just gave in.
you know what? My grandmother hikes faster than you both,
but she's already dead.
get him. Go get him.
how about you carry the packs for a while, eh?
come here. Look at this.
ls it nice?
baby.
bringing up the rear.
so have you slept with her yet? - What was that?
have you slept with her yet?
crossing the line.
dad, it's been 10 years. it's time.
stay away from all the beautiful girls.
they are dangerous.
a week is too short. - Yeah.
a week is too short. - Yup.
listen, l've made you a mixtape.
and l give you a present. For you.
thank you.
l'm missing you already.
Bye, Liz.
be safe. - Same to you.
so don't l get a kiss?
l don't know.
l love you, Dad. - l love you too.
so stupid, l know.
he's 19 years old and he's such a man.
lt's sweet.
you're sweet.
darling...
...It's time.
Liz. - What?
Liz. Come here. l have to tell you something.
no. l should really, really be meditating.
go, go. Do it.
you know, l have not been to see Ketut in two weeks.
Really? - Yes.
okay. Go, go. - Okay.
Oh, gosh. But you are just so much cuter than Ketut.
no, l have to go. l have to go.
Why?
you have bladder infection.
common after no sex, then too much sexy time.
we haven't even been apart for a minute in two weeks.
you're afraid now, right?
l understand.
you don't want to lose yourself.
love is scary, dangerous.
happen to me.
l pray every day, but husband bad for me.
l have to get away from him.
this from where he hit me with motorcycle helmet.
and then my daughter...
...she begged me to leave him.
ls that right, honey?
l said, " l think you should get a divorce, Mommy. "
she was 4 years old when she said it.
don't feel bad about Felipe.
everybody needs affection, honey.
make people do funny things.
everyone gets keep that at beginning of relationship.
want too much happiness, too much pleasure, until make yourself sick.
even to Wayan, this happen at beginning of my love affair.
l lose myself, Liz.
dear friends and loved ones:
my birthday's coming up soon.
if l were home, l'd be planning a stupid, expensive birthday party,
and you'd all be buying me gifts and bottles of wine.
a cheaper, more lovely way to celebrate would be to...
...make a donation to help a healer named Wayan Nuriyasih,
...buy a house in lndonesia.
she's a single mother. In Bali, after a divorce...
a woman gets nothing, not even her children.
to gain custody of her daughter, Tutti, Wayan had to sell everything...
...even her bath mat, to pay for a lawyer.
for years, they've moved from place to place.
each time, Wayan loses clientele and Tutti has to change schools.
this little group of people in Bali have become my famlly.
and we must take care of our families, wherever we find them.
today l saw Tutti playing with a blue tile she'd found in the road near a hotel construction site.
she told me.
maybe if we have a house someday...
...it can have a pretty blue floor like this.
when l was in ltaly, l learned a word
lt's " tuftl " with double T.
which in ltalian means " everybody." So that's the lesson, isn't it?
when you set out in the world to help yourself...
...sometimes you end up helping Tutti.
tell me again. - Eighteen thousand American dollars.
l brought you the e-mails to look at.
Oh, my God.
we get a house.
lt can be the house for everybody!
l can have a pharmacy! l can have a library!
all right. Oh, God. -Close them again. Close your eyes.
careful. You don't wanna break a tooth or anything.
don't worry, but close your eyes. - Where are you taking me?
you will see.
you helped Wayan to get a house... - l know.
...and we're going to celebrate.
here, here, here. - All right.
turn, turn, turn. - l know we're at the beach.
here you go.
we're going to take a little boat trip.
where? - To a little island nearby.
lt's my favorite place in the world. l've packed for two.
we can stay there until next Tuesday. And have the perfect camping spot.
just you and me and 400 parrots.
do you like it?
l was going to save it for tonight, but l think this is the right moment.
l have to be in Bali because my business is here,
and you have to be in New York,
because that's where your life is, right?
what if we tried to create a life that is divided between the two places?
why would you wanna do that?
because l'm in love with you.
let's go. Let's go. - Oh, no. l...
what? - l can't. l'm sorry.
l just... - You can't?
l'm sorry. l can't. - Can't what?
l can't go on a trip right now, okay? l...
l haven't been home in five days. l haven't seen Ketut in weeks.
lt's just too much. - lt's not much.
to go... by ourselves,
apart from everything else for a couple of days, is that much for you?
Liz, What's the problem, Liz?
l mean, l have the same fears, l have the same scars that you have...
...and l show them to you.
but l guess the only difference between you and l is that...
you are afraid to love again.
my darling, this is it.
you have to look me in the eye and let me know the truth.
please. Do you love me or do you love me not?
look me in the eyes and tell me...
...do you love me or don't you love me not? it's very easy.
l know you feel the same way. Why can't you say it back?
l don't know why.
why can't I ?
because you're terrified, my love. But listen, it's fine. Me too.
but l still want to get into that boat with you.
no. Okay, look. Look. - What?
l don't know why you can't understand this.
l found something and l can't give it up.
and trust me, if l did, you wouldn't be so all in love with me.
okay, the balance thing. You traveled around the world to find your balance.
and the balance that you think you've found is what?
meditating for 20 minutes and going to see an old medicine man?
listen, balance, my darling, balance is not letting anybody love you...
less than you love yourself. -You know what? You know what?
do not tell me what lessons l have and haven't learned in the last year...
...and don't tell me how balanced and wise you are...
...and how l can't express myself.
and do not say " darling " to me again because l am just gonna lose it.
listen to me! l do not need to love you to prove that l love myself.
run away from me?
you are running away from all the great possibilities of your own life.
l'm getting into that boat.
for you.
a goodbye gift.
...you healed me.
you healed me too, Ketut.
lf it wasn't for you, l wouldn't have come back to Bali...
...and l wouldn't have come back to myself.
you want coffee? Roast pig?
coffee.
l get you coffee.
you fly back to America soon?
ln two hours.
have you ever been on an airplane, Ketut?
Ketut cannot fly on aeroplane.
Ketut have no teeths.
you are good friend to me.
you are like daughter.
when l die...
...you will come back to Bali? Come to my cremation?
balinese cremation ceremony is very fun.
you will like it. - Okay.
you still smile with your liver, like l tell you?
Yes.
you still meditate like your guru in lndia teach you?
Yes. - You happy now with God?
Yes. - You love your new boyfriend?
l ended it.
don't understand. Why you do that?
l couldn't keep my balance.
liss, listen to Ketut.
sometimes to lose balance for love...
...is part of living balanced life.
in the end...
...I've come to believe in something l call " The Physics of the Quest. "
a force in nature governed by laws as real as the laws of gravity.
the rule of Quest Physics goes something like this:
lf you're brave enough to leave behind everything familiar and comforting...
...which can be anything from your house to bitter, old resentments,
and set out on a truth-seeking journey...
either externally or internally...
...and if you accept everyone you meet along the way as a teacher...
...and if you are prepared, most of all...
to face and forgive some very difficult realities about yourself...
...then the truth will not be withheld from you.
I can't help but believe it, given my experience.
l decided on my word.
lt means:
"let's cross over. "
you're stuck on me and my laughing eyes, I can't pretend though I try to hide, I like you, I think I felt my heart skip a beat, I'm standing here and I can hardly breathe. You got me. You got me. The way you take my hand is just so sweet. And that crooked smile of yours. It knocks me off my feet. Oh, I just can't get enough. I'm a stew I need to fill me up. It feels so good it must be love. It's everything that I've been dreaming of I give up, I give in. I let go. Let's begin 'Cause no matter what I do. My heart is filled with you. I hope we always feel this way. I know you will. And in my heart I know that. You'll always stay.
this is Sophie Hall from "The New Yorker."
Hi, Mr. Beal. Thank you for calling me back.
no. I'm not a writer. I'm a fact checker, actually.
it is a bit like being a detective, yes.
let's see if you are the Robert Beal that I'm looking for.
can you confirm where you were when you found out World War II was over?
poughkeepsie? All right. Right, thank you so much.
Yes, the moment the war ended.
palm Beach? Okay. Lucky guy.
thank you very much. Bye.
Bobby, hey, I got nothing, but there's two more Robert Beals, and one petty officer, third class.
wait.
I'm gonna call you back.
Sophie Hall.
can you confirm where you were when you found out World War II was over?
times Square? I'm in Times Square right now.
I'm standing exactly where the photograph was taken.
I really thought I would never find you.
so, can you... can I ask you to describe what you saw that day?
the kiss, was it spontaneous or was it staged?
it was.
you're certain?
so you're 100% positive?
petty Officer First Class Robert Beal, who was the second sailor, said that the nurse was the bee's knees and that the kiss was a completely spontaneous moment and a celebration of real love.
and he told you this himself? Yes, he did.
cause it's not often that I request a personal audience with a fact checker.
it's cause I need to know you're sure.
I'm 100% positive.
great.
I guess people wanna believe in true love, don't they?
speaking of which, I understand that you're headed off to Verona for a pre-honeymoon?
explain that to me.
it's just a vacation before the wedding.
it's our last chance to spend time alone before his restaurant... Well, it's the city of love, isn't it?
Yeah. But I...
good choice, and good work. Thank you.
I was thinking. What if while I'm there, I write?
but you're such a good fact checker.
have a great trip. Thank you. See you later.
who goes on a honeymoon without a wedding? You are so lucky.
well, Victor's restaurant opens in six weeks, so it's our last chance.
okay, do not let him pay attention to anything but you, okay?
you throw his cell phone in the Adriatic.
but he has to meet suppliers.
Sophie...It's fine. I promise.
okay. Wait, what?
Hey, sweetheart, can I help you carry your magazine?
okay, no problem.
Oh, my God.
Hey, close your eyes. Close your eyes, close your eyes.
close your eyes, close your eyes.
close your eyes. Open your mouth.
it's good? Yeah.
yes? No? Yes?
yes? I have reinvented the noodle, I'm telling you.
just try this one because this one's really good.
it's the same thing, but different. Fatter.
Mmm. More of, you know... No?
it's good, right? Yeah? Mmm-hmm.
you know, I mean, modestly speaking, I think I'm creating a masterpiece.
I don't know. I mean, there's one that just came out perfect right now, which is... I think it's this one. I think it's...， Victor?
try it. Even though it's dry, try it. Victor, Victor...
can I just say something? What?
we're leaving in 12 hours, and you haven't packed for Verona.
at all. Yeah, that's right, that's right.
Yeah. I get too carried away. Do we clean this up?
no, no.
it's gonna be incredible. I know. I'm so excited.
Sophia!
Sophia! Wherefore art thou, my sweet Sophia?
I love this place. I love. Right? It's amazing.
I have to show you the most beautiful...
you know what's even more amazing?
what? I just got off the phone with Signor Morini, and he's arranged a private tour for us with each and every one of my suppliers.
we're starting off with the oldest and most beautiful vineyard in all of Veneto.
yeah?
Victor.
Sophie, come on. No, you're not getting it.
I mean, we're gonna go to the oldest, the most beautiful vineyard around.
this is romantic. All right?
we're gonna go there, we're gonna drink a little wine, we're gonna get a little tipsy, and we're gonna come back and we're gonna...
I mean, how was it?
I tried to talk to Bobby again. How did it go?
it didn't go, because I didn't talk to him.
Why? Because I was scared.
Really?
it's time for me to stop checking facts and actually start writing.
Yeah, yeah, it's your passion. You should do that.
it's the grape that I told you about that they use for the region, Soave? Right, right, right.
you know. You remember? Yeah.
do you like? This is good.
it's fresh flower and fruit. Do you feel it?
yeah? You feel it? It's so good.
smile.
Sophie.
we have to get tickets to the opera before they sell out.
we need to see the Castelvecchio. Yeah, yeah.
we have to see Lake Garda and Juliet's house. Yeah, of course. Yeah.
Sophie, this is beautiful. This is incredible. The smell...
Sophie, this is amazing! This is great!
I wish I was a little mouse living in your cheese cave.
Hey, that was Signor Morini on the phone.
you know, he's inviting us to this incredible forest, that's just, like, 120 kilometers away.
and they dig these exquisite truffles... Wait. 120 kilometers?
Yeah, it's not like miles, Sophie.
no, I understand the difference, but I just...
I just don't understand why you wanna go 120 kilometers to see a mushroom.
it's not a mushroom, okay?
it's a truffle. It's a tartufo.
it's the thing that you put on top of pasta, you know?
a tartufo? It's something else. It's...
come on, you've been having a good day, right?
it was fine.
but now, I just...
to be honest, I don't really feel like going to see a mushroom.
okay, fine, I get it. I get it. It's fine. I get it.
I mean, just don't call it a mushroom, okay?
Yeah, okay.
you know what? Why don't you go see the truffle place and I'll go do my thing and sightsee? Really?
Yeah. Win-win.
my dear Juliet...
dear Juliet, the man that I love is not my husband.
are you okay?
take this basket and... Come si dice? Dig in.
dig in?
you are the translator from the employment office?
no. No, I mean... I have been waiting two weeks.
I'm sorry. My name is Sophie. I just... I followed you, and I saw that you put the letters into a basket, and I just wondered why.
Why?
you are a writer?
Yeah, I am. I am a writer.
come. I show you.
they come from all over the world every day.
but taking their letters?
is that not like taking pennies from a wishing well?
how else can we give them answers?
Oh, my God. So, you write all of them back.
Yes.
you're all Juliet? Her secretaries.
donatella has been married 51 years to the same man.
she handles husband problems.
husbands are like wine. They take a long time to mature.
francesca is a nurse. She deals with illness and loss.
and Maria...
why do you always sigh when you say my name?
she has 12 children, 29 grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.
she writes whatever she likes. And you?
Isabella answers the ones you can barely read.
Yeah, the lovers' quarrels, the breakups, the really tangled hearts.
someone has to do it.
my mother. Would you like to stay for dinner, Sophie?
mamma, this is not an insult.
I make a beautiful dish, big enough for the whole town, and she says no.
I would love to, but I do... I have to go.
this is the problem of the americani.
always running. Please, Mamma.
I have to meet my fiance.
fiance
at least take some dessert for you and your fiance?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
you know, 120 kilometers each way and I'm still beating you?
Congratulations. What? Yeah. What?
I mean, how was Verona? How was it without me?
empty? Half-empty? Completely empty?
half-empty.
I met the Secretaries of Juliet. Juliet?
like Juliet Capulet? Yeah.
there are these women that call themselves the Secretaries of Juliet, and they write letters to people that write letters to Juliet.
and then these secretaries, they work for the city of Verona, and, like, all these people, these brokenhearted women all over the world, come and they write letters and leave them on the wall. What's in the bag?
I don't know.
so, they post these letters.
they post them on the wall in Juliet's courtyard, and then these secretaries come back with this basket and they retrieve the letters every day.
and then they write back, as Juliet, to all the letters that have return addresses on them.
this is their job. I mean, it's so unbelievable.
this is their passion. It's what they do every day.
they literally will work all day, every day. Mmm! Oh, my God!
and they've been doing it for years.
Sophie. Wow. This is incredible!
and they...
this is incredible.
this is incredible. Oh, my God.
this is great. Try this, try this. You have to try this. Oh, my God.
no... Give it a good bite. Come on.
your Victor is very passionate.
Yes, yes, I know.
but he seems to think that he's Italian since we got here.
and although imitation is, of course, the highest form of flattery, his imitations are not very good.
okay, that woman is amazing. I mean, she's incredible.
she's incredible. I think I'm in love.
Absolutely. You're in love with her?
Yeah. Yeah. Really?
okay. Just say no.
just say no, and I won't do it, really.
I mean, I'm dying to do it, but I won't.
okay. What?
angelina's offered to teach me some secrets today.
okay. Yeah.
okay, right now and all day?
like, right now. That's crazy, right? I mean, now. That's amazing.
I mean, she's making risotto all'Amarone, right? Yeah?
good risotto. You see?
you see, it's, like, 300 years old or something, her recipe.
it's fantastic.
okay. That's great. But... so, no Lake Garda then today?
Oh, yeah. Lake Garda...
I mean, Lake Garda's been there for, like, 500, 000 years, you know.
and right now, Angelina's offered to help me.
and, you know, I mean, I'm here, we're here, you know.
we're having a good time. You, Paul Newman, you want to work, you have to watch!
you see? I mean, you see, I became Paul Newman. All right?
okay, what shall I do? I mean, my hands are tied.
I don't know. I don't know.
you could help us if you like.
Yeah! Yeah. The letter thing, right? Why not?
Yeah, yeah, you write the letters and I'll cook. And later we eat and...
win-win.
how long have you and Victor been engaged?
almost a year.
Wow. And may I ask why don't you wear an engagement ring?
Yeah, see, that's... That's me. I insisted.
he was so busy, you know, this whole restaurant and everything.
and I guess I felt it unnecessary.
still, a girl should have a ring.
I didn't go to him, Juliet.
I didn't go to Lorenzo.
his eyes were so full of trust.
I promised I'd meet him to run away together "because my parents don't approve.
but instead, I left him waiting for me, below our tree, "waiting and wondering where I was.
I'm in Verona now.
I return to London in the morning, and I'm so afraid.
please, Juliet, tell me what I should do.
my heart is breaking, and I have no one else to turn to.
love, Claire.
and it's been there for all those years?
I think she came back to find her one true love.
and they had 10 children and still make passionate love every night.
except he got bald and fat and she has to do all the work.
Francesca. Francesca.
and maybe she stayed in London and married a duke and lived happily ever after, just like me.
but you married an accountant, not a duke. Nobody's perfect.
and I bet when she's making love to that duke...
yeah? She's imagining her first love, Lorenzo.
Isabella, I have to write back.
then answer her.
good night, friends.
good night.
Hey.
Hey.
sorry I'm late. No, it's fine. No worries.
how was your day? Good? It was...
it was so good. Yeah?
Yeah. Good. I'm glad.
how was Angelina?
Yeah, it was good. I mean, she's amazing, you know.
that woman is incredible.
she's very instinctive, you know. She cooks without recipes.
I mean, she's incredible.
she's invited me to cook again. Really?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I can learn a lot from her.
but...
no, no, you first, you first. Sorry, sorry.
no, just real quick. I just... Mmm-hmm?
I had the most amazing day.
I got to answer a letter that was written 50 years ago.
I know it might not get there, but it just feels so good to write.
Yeah, I think you should spend more time with them.
Why? Because it's your passion, right?
and also because it fits perfectly.
because I just got off the phone with Signor Morini, and he's invited me to this amazing wine auction that's happening in Livorno.
in Livorno? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
it's super-exclusive.
I mean, I don't know... I don't know if I can get a ticket, you know.
I mean, I'll be off, like, a day or two, max.
if you want, I'll try to get two tickets, but I'm not sure I can get two tickets. Yeah.
to a wine auction? In Livorno?
Yeah, it sounds terrible. I know.
I'm sorry. I'm so...
I feel terrible now. I feel terrible. I mean, it's...
I miss you already, you know.
I'll be back very soon. Okay? Yeah. Be careful.
Bye! Ciao.
listen to what this poor girl writes.
Juliet, is there anything worse in this world than a man?
excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but are you the Secretaries of Juliet?
Yes, that's us. Great.
may I ask, which one of you wrote this letter to my grandmother, Claire Smith?
I wrote that. And I can't believe that it found you.
Yes. We Brits tend to stay in our family homes.
Yeah. This is amazing. It's less than a week since I mailed it.
it was a very thoughtful letter.
now, what were you thinking?
I was thinking that she deserved an answer.
Yeah, 50 years ago, maybe. Not now.
I'm sorry. I didn't know true love had an expiration date.
true love? Are you joking?
could you imagine what would've happened if she hadn't seen sense?
well, yeah, you wouldn't be here, and that would be an upside.
what are you doing here anyway?
what, are you some lonely American girl who has to live vicariously through others?
I'm not lonely. I am engaged.
my condolences to the groom.
excuse me!
so that's it?
you've come all the way from London to give me a lecture?
no, I came because I couldn't let my grandmother come on her own.
Claire is here? Why?
I think even you might be able to work that one out.
Oh, my God!
that's awesome! She's come to find her Lorenzo!
awesome?
and if Lorenzo doesn't want to see her, has forgotten her, is gravely ill or dead, let's say, just for fun, then what?
thought so.
I want to meet her. I'd like to meet Claire.
and I want to play for Manchester United, but I'm shit at football.
you don't think that she wants to meet me?
I honestly think she has no interest meeting a woman that can manage to jam, "Oh, my God" and "awesome," into the same sentence.
gran, they're closing up. We should go now.
excuse me. Claire? Hi. Hi. My name is Sophie, and I wrote you the letter.
letter? From Juliet?
goodness! Thank you.
thank you. But however did you find us?
well, your grandson found me, actually. You did?
right, well, the thing is,
I thought we should... Yeah, well, he's very sweet and very charming, and he thought that you might like to meet me.
uncharacteristically thoughtful of you, dear.
Yes, well, under the circumstances, it seems a little churlish not to meet the woman responsible for this voyage of lunacy. Okay.
Charlie doesn't approve, which makes this all the more fun.
we were just going for a glass of wine. Would you like to join us?
absolutely not.
what? Absolutely not.
it's been a long day. It's too long a day.
okay, darling. Have a good sleep. But I...
do you know somewhere we could go?
I actually have the perfect place.
I can't believe you're really here.
I was taking an art course in Tuscany, staying with a family outside Siena, and they had a son Lorenzo, and it was love at first sight.
he had such gentle blue eyes.
and he told me I was very beautiful.
and he gave me this ring.
we wanted to get married, but I'd got exams back in England and my parents would never have agreed, and I got scared, and I ran away.
now what I really want is to tell him that I'm so sorry I was such a coward.
of course, a card or letter is just too simple.
so, you've come to find your Lorenzo?
Yes, and I think I know where he is.
where?
on the farm, just near Siena.
Charlie's driving me down tomorrow.
only because I didn't want you to hitchhike.
well, he thinks it's a big mistake.
because you don't have a romantic bone in your body.
no, no. It's because I am a realist.
no. Because you are an Englishman!
cold as fish!
right. And who was it that wrote Romeo and Juliet?
Williamo Shakespearelli, a great Italian.
they're mad. They're mad.
Sophie, my dear.
good night. Thank you so much.
thank you.
good night. Good night, everybody.
good night. Charlie, let's go.
good night, ladies. Ciao. Good luck.
Bye. Ciao.
how wonderful would it be if she found her Romeo?
imagine if she did, 50 years later, all because you found that letter.
nobody would believe it if it weren't true, you know.
wait! Wait!
Oh, for... Here she comes. Sorry.
may I come with you to find Lorenzo? Come with us?
what about this fianc? of yours?
you're in the city of love and you want to come with us?
Yes, I do. Because he's busy and I'm free. And I mean...
of course, if it's not an intrusion.
no, no, it's not an intrusion.
I just... Listen,
I do have one thing to tell you first. It's not an intrusion.
this is not entirely selfless.
it started out as a simple reply to your letter, and now I think it's so amazing what you're doing, and I'd love to write about it if it's okay. A journalist.
gran, a journalist trying to pry into our private lives.
Charlie, come on. It's hardly state secrets, is it?
I'm not a journalist. I would like to be some day, but...
and you think Gran's story is your ticket?
I think it's a story worth telling.
I'd love to have you with us.
Really? Yes. Of course.
we would.
how much time did you actually spend with Lorenzo?
every second that we could.
I'd go to meet him after class, to the farm where he was working, and we'd sit under the trees and we'd share some bread with tomatoes and olive oil.
it's so romantic. Yeah.
what's so romantic about eating in the dirt?
Really?
the dirt. Well, you see, he loved the earth.
he loved talking to me about the rain and the springs of fresh water, and we'd walk for miles and miles.
we'd lie in the dry grass.
I can still remember the smell of his sweet, hot sweat and...
okay. Okay, Gran. We get the picture.
so you must feel like you're about to find your long-lost soul mate.
Yes.
her soul mate was my grandfather.
let's not invalidate my entire existence.
okay, I'm sorry, I just... That's clearly not what I meant.
Charlie's just like my husband.
both skeptics.
my husband always insisted that love was nothing but hormones.
but you see, underneath, he had such a warm, passionate heart.
and Charlie's just the same.
tell me about the guy you're in love with.
Victor.
Yeah.
well, Victor is a chef, an amazing chef. Wow.
Yeah. He's opening his own restaurant in New York.
and that's the reason we're here. We're meeting suppliers all around.
and he's actually... He's in Livorno at a wine auction as we speak.
that sounds fun.
for him. Yeah.
well, and do your parents like him?
Yeah, my dad. My dad likes him.
my mom left us when I was nine.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear. I'm sorry about that.
that's okay. It was a really long time ago.
slowly, slowly.
how do you want to go about this?
ring the doorbell.
what if the wife answers and goes into a fit of jealous rage? Gran?
well, I'd be flattered.
I'm more worried that he won't remember me.
right. Let's go home then, Gran, before this all ends in tears.
come on. There's no one in.
I'm gonna check the back.
there's no... We made our best effort.
there's no need to prolong the disappointment.
it's me, yeah.
good afternoon. I'm Charlie Wyman.
this is my grandmother, Claire, and Sophie. Ciao.
I'm Claire. Do you remember?
Claire.
it's not him.
are you sure?
it's not his eyes.
let's make sure.
do you remember what you were doing in the summer of 1957?
the summer of 1957, I will never forget,
I met the most beautiful girl with long, blonde hair.
Nana!
we married that year.
I curse that woman! What?
Oh, no! Right.
I curse her eyes! I curse her teeth!
I curse her mustache!
but why are you asking? Why you bring up such a horrible memory?
well, that went well.
can't say we didn't try, Nana. I'm sorry. Truly.
are you for real?
if I actually knew what that question meant, I might attempt to answer it.
he can't be the only Lorenzo Bartolini in Tuscany.
well, he's the only one around here, so...
I haven't flown all the way here to pack it in now.
Nana, what do you want to do?
you want to start knocking on every door asking if Lorenzo's in? I mean...
how many can there be?
Seventy-four?
seventy-four Lorenzo Bartolinis and you want to go on a scavenger hunt?
impossible. We're going home in the morning.
come on, Charlie, will you calm down? Sophie, what do you think?
gran, what do you mean, what does she think? She doesn't think.
this was her brilliant idea. It's over! Done! We found Nemo.
the curtains have closed.
Sophie. Listen, this is my job.
I find things. And through process of elimination and caveat emptor, which will require assembling a few more facts, we can narrow this down considerably.
did Ms. Awesome For Real just use caveat emptor?
Oh, please, all right. I went to Brown. Double Major. Minor in Latin.
this is madness. It's madness.
Charlie, didn't you say you wanted to go and swim?
we are working. Go away. This is utter, complete mad...
work!
I can't believe it.
ridiculous.
he's a good-looking sort.
isn't he?
all right. Are you sure that Lorenzo would never have left this area?
he loved this land. I'm quite certain.
may I?
our Lorenzos.
are you sure that you have time for all this?
Ciao. How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
you know what? I was just witnessing this most incredible, incredible Sauterne auction.
it was just beautiful. It was incredible. How's it going?
I'm good. I'm in Siena right now.
what? In Siena?
what are you doing in Siena? I'm writing a story.
we're kind of on a bit of an adventure, looking for somebody that she used to know 50 years ago.
you know what, baby? You know what?
I mean, this isn't a good time because I'm in the middle of something, but, I mean, I'm glad you called because I was actually just gonna call you right now.
you know, the opportunities here are really, really, really incredible, you know, and I think I'm gonna have to stay till Friday.
can I stay or should I skip it?
I mean, I feel horrible, but...
no, do it. Please. I'm gonna need until Friday, as well.
great. So Friday, all right? Friday. Friday's good. Okay. Win-win.
Claire?
I'm free.
free for what? Free for what? She's coming.
she's coming with us. She's coming? Splendid.
that's splendid! Fantastic!
too bad I'm not the Lorenzo you're looking for.
if you don't find him, come back.
I'll make you a fish dinner.
okay? Okay.
good luck.
it's not him.
Oh, my God. No!
well, wouldn't this be nice, Gran?
going from a boy who works the fields to a man who owns them.
and you got to skip the messy bits.
life is the messy bits.
Peccato it wasn't me.
Yes.
I would have never let you go.
believe me.
what is it with you and Italian men? They fall at your feet.
it's such a shame. I think I could've been happy here.
happy? Did your grandson just say happy?
I said could have been.
let's not get carried away. I have a reputation to uphold.
Charlie, why don't you tell Sophi about your pro bono legal work?
I can't imagine she'd have much interest, Gran.
try me. You know the sort of thing, defending the defenseless, preserving human rights, helping refugees get asylum.
you look surprised. I'm so surprised.
I just didn't have you pinned down as the save-humanity type at all.
Really?
and what type did you have me pinned down for exactly?
well, I was leaning towards elitist Oxford prig, but now that you mention it, self-satisfied do-gooder works, as well.
I guess you're a poor judge of character then.
but she does deal with facts, Charlie.
okay.
I'm off to bed. Okay.
good night, darling. Good night. Sleep well.
may I walk you to your room? Be nice to each other.
she is awesome.
I respect your usage of the word this one instance.
Oh, I'm flattered. Thank you for approving.
you're very welcome.
right. Well. Should we hit the sack?
sorry. I guess I...
well, as much as I'd love to sit here and drink the whole bottle of Caparzo...
no, go to bed. You should. Good night, Charlie.
right.
well, good night. Good night.
forgive me. Where are my manners?
you know, I've been wondering that since I met you.
Yes, well, I don't know what it is, but you seem to bring out the very worst in me.
somehow it's my fault. All of this is your fault.
you wrote that blasted letter.
nonetheless, may I walk you to your room?
you know, I'm not the buttoned-up, buttock-clenching killjoy you try to make me out as.
right. And I made you argue that true love is bollocks.
guilty.
it's just that I'm genuinely worried for her.
I know she may seem carefree, but her life hasn't been all that simple.
is it that unreasonable for me to worry?
no, but I have a really good feeling about this. You'll see.
let's hope you're right.
Signora Claire.
Signor Bartolini.
do you remember me? I'm Claire Smith.
your beautiful face, it's so familiar...
good evening.
we're not done yet.
of course we're not, darling.
hello.
Hello? Hello.
Hi. Is Claire with you? No?
no, no. She's turned in early, actually.
okay.
I was gonna ask if you wanted dinner, but...
I just... I wanted to get started on my story.
how's it coming?
it's coming okay.
am I in it?
you may be. Why? Can I read just a little bit?
are you kidding me? Come on, just a little bit.
absolutely not.
how am I to be sure that I'm being properly portrayed?
no, you are. Believe me. You are.
what's that supposed to mean? It means good night, Charlie.
good night. Okay.
Yeah.
good night.
what? Okay. Is this one of those situations where you're really saying the opposite of what you actually mean?
no.
right.
good night then.
good night, Charlie.
good morning.
good morning.
gran wants to sleep in this morning.
is she okay? I mean, does she need anything?
no need. She's tough as old boots, that one.
Churchill in a dress.
so, I thought I'd see a bit of Siena since we're here.
it's a good idea.
I suppose you want to keep on writing.
I mean...
work, work, work.
admirable trait.
right, of course. Carry on then.
Charlie?
since we're here...
I hate to compliment you, but what you're doing for Claire is really...
it's sweet, and I...
I imagine that you'd rather be spending your holiday elsewhere, so did you volunteer your services, or did your parents?
I mean, where do they fit in?
I'd like to think they're someplace nice.
they were killed in a car accident when I was 10.
I'm sorry.
God, I'm sorry.
thank you, Sophie. I appreciate it.
it was a difficult time.
gran lost her son.
I lost my parents.
I'm not a big believer in happy endings, I'm afraid.
anyway, Gran stepped in.
took an angry, obnoxious, young boy under her wing and made me the simply unpleasant man I am today.
so, isn't your fiance starting to get just a tad lonely?
you know, Victor's having the time of his life right now.
and I doubt he even notices that I'm gone.
what about you?
don't you have a girlfriend? That is a very, very long story.
yeah? I'm not surprised.
it's been about a year since I've seen Patricia.
and you broke up with her?
are you insinuating that I'm more the type to be dumped rather than do the dumping?
maybe I am.
actually, I did break up with Patricia. This time.
okay, that's enough.
all right. That's enough.
Sophie... That's enough.
your writing is really good. Thank you.
no. It's really, really, really good.
why are you so surprised?
how come you've never shown your work to anyone?
I never feel like it's finished. Why?
because I guess I'm a perfectionist.
you know that's just another way of saying "I'm a chicken"?
listen. You've got nothing to be afraid of.
you're not a fact checker. You're a writer.
what was that for? I'm not a chicken.
and I'm not a gentleman.
do you think we should get back to Claire?
Yeah. Many more Lorenzos.
okay.
we should get back to Claire.
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!
take him! Take him!
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!
do you know what you are?
you are the Montagues and the Capulets.
you mean... Well, at least I'm not Romeo.
that's the understatement of the century.
no, no, no, because you see, if I found the love of my life, I wouldn't stand there like an idiot whispering in a garden.
I would just grab her from that blasted balcony and be done with it.
do you believe in destiny?
do you?
Yeah, I think so.
I think it's destiny that I'm here, right now.
with Claire.
of course. Of course. With Claire.
well, this is the street.
well, there's 2. Here's number 2.
this is what I feared the most.
Charlie, we don't even know if it's him.
I hope it's not. I hope it's not.
either way, we're finished. We're done. No. Not here.
when do we stop?
over the next hill? Or the next? Scour the whole country?
no. No. It ends here.
there are other Lorenzos not too far away from here.
it's not the ending you want, is it?
this isn't just a clever story with a clever ending. Stop it, Charlie.
it's our life. It's my Gran's life.
Charlie, it's not about a story.
no, no, no, she's already lost the man once.
how many more times would you have her lose him?
you know what? I don't expect you to understand any of this because you don't know a thing about real loss.
Yeah.
you're wrong.
Sophie's mother ran away from her when she was a little girl.
it's different, Gran. It's different.
you're right.
but Sophie's mother chose to leave her.
and you always knew your mum and dad loved you.
come in.
Hi.
Oh, dear.
I just wanted to see if you were all right.
I'm okay.
Claire, I'm so sorry if I caused you...
no.
every minute has been so special.
darling.
may I?
one of the great joys in life is having one's hair brushed.
Charlie, say you're sorry.
in the eye, Charlie. With contrition.
Sophie...
thank you. ... I'm afraid I...
in the eye.
Yes, Gran, I'm not 12.
prove it.
I'm sincerely sorry, Sophie.
it won't happen again.
excellent.
Sophie,
I want to make a toast. Thank you.
I want to thank you for the wonderful thing you did for a complete stranger.
I'll never forget it.
nor I.
I've had the most incredible few days. I really have, and I can't thank you enough for letting me tag along.
I think you did more than tag along.
here is to all our loved ones, wherever they may be.
may I join you?
please.
I am sorry, Sophie.
I used to lay out under the stars as a kid, in the summertime.
doubt thou the stars are fire "Doubt that the sun doth move
doubt truth be a liar "But never doubt I love
do you think he's out there? Lorenzo?
Yeah.
he's somewhere.
and am I wrong? To insist she quit?
no, you know, you can't go on forever.
at some point, you have to stop.
then why is it that I feel like a schoolboy on Sunday?
it's nearly tomorrow and I don't want to go.
me, either.
and I always liked school.
morning. Morning.
thank you.
how'd you sleep?
I slept fine. How about you?
Yes. Great. Thanks.
good morning. Good morning.
how are you? Good morning, my darling.
it's a beautiful day.
Sophie, would you mind going in the front?
because I'd love to stretch my legs for a bit.
okay.
fantastic, darling.
the stars were spectacular from my window.
look. That vineyard. That's our favorite wine.
let's turn in there and have a goodbye toast.
okay.
Charlie, stop!
Nana, what is it?
it's Lorenzo.
who?
the boy?
all right, Nana. Let's get you in the shade. Shall we?
I am Lorenzo Bartolini.
Sophie. I think this is...
do you know a Lorenzo Bartolini? I asked him and...
I am Lorenzo Bartolini. You are!
Oh, my... Sophie, he's the grandson!
can I help you? Yes.
we're looking for a Lorenzo Bartolini.
I am Lorenzo Bartolini.
he's Lorenzo, too. Do you have a father also named Lorenzo?
Yes, he went out riding. But what can I do for you?
I'm sorry. We're being terribly rude.
I'm Charlie Wyman. I'm Sophie.
Lorenzo. Lorenzo.
we have been on quite a journey for your father.
you see, my grandmother, Claire, knows him.
Charlie. Charlie, let's go!
let's go!
all right.
Nana, Nana, Nana, Lorenzo is here.
he's out riding, but he's going to be back any minute.
well, then, let's go before he comes back.
Nana, we've come all this way.
come on. I've been ridiculous.
I've been completely ridiculous.
he knew me when I was 15 years old, a girl.
that girl's gone.
Oh, my God.
Claire?
Yes.
so many years.
Yes, 50.
if you allow me.
I really don't know how to express myself.
well, I went for a ride this morning as an old man, and I came back as a teenager again.
I'm so very happy you all meet Claire and her grandson, Charlie, and their lovely friend, Sophie.
my dear Claire, you have told me you lost your Jack.
and you know I lost my Rosa. Yeah.
but destiny wanted us to meet again.
health to the Bartolini family.
to the Bartolinis.
I'm sorry I was late.
no.
when we are speaking about love, it's never too late.
well, bad luck, eh?
all hope lost and he rides in at the last moment on a white horse.
no one will believe it.
promise me...
promise me you'll finish the story.
I guess this is it.
and I'm sorry it is.
Yeah, me, too.
Sophie, I...
I never should've kissed you. I was completely out of bounds.
you're engaged and...
it's time to go.
goodbye, Charlie.
I'll miss you.
Hi. It is time to...
I must get back to Victor. Sorry.
Yes. Of course.
so, where's Charlie? We'll give you a drive there straight away.
no, I'm...
Claire, I can't take you away from this place, so...
my son can drive you.
just a moment.Yes. Grazie.
I'm so happy for you.
is something wrong?
No! No.
no. It's just, you know...
and you're leaving?
an angel brought you to me.
thank you.
thank you. I'll be eternally grateful.
thank you.
it's very kind. Thank you.
thank you so much.
you're always welcome here. Thank you.
thank you, Lorenzo. Ciao.
speak soon.
Bye.
darling, you're family, so I think you'll understand why I'm telling you you're a total idiot.
okay, okay, then don't sugarcoat it, Gran.
I won't.
how many Sophies do you think there are on this planet?
don't wait 50 years like I did.
go. Go! Go!
I missed you so much! So much.
...in person because I couldn't send you an e-mail,
because it was... It just didn't make sense, because I know you were having...
one second.
Hello? Hey. Yeah, yeah.
we just have to sort out all the deliveries that we need to make.
I mean...
what happened?
you don't like the ending?
no, the ending's fine. It's actually quite moving.
but what happened to the people? I mean, are they still together?
what about... What about the kid? What about Charlie? Where's he?
I don't know. I didn't keep in touch.
do you have any advice?
I think you should buy stock in Alitalia, 'cause all the ladies are gonna be flocking to Verona.
are you gonna publish this?
Yeah, I'm gonna publish it. It's a good story.
you got anything else for me?
no, not at the moment.
Oh, my God.
you said Tuscan gold, right? Tuscan gold?
look. This is yellow.
yellow. Tuscan gold. Yellow.
I mean, there's no Tuscany, there's no gold.
it's just like Limoncello, you know. Sure.
yeah? Can we do it again? Yeah. Yeah.
yeah? All right, all right, all right. Let's go. Come on.
let's try it again.
Hey, Sophie. Hi.
Hey, how's your day been?
I showed my story to Bobby. Did he like it?
Yeah, he's gonna print it.
print it? Yeah.
Wow! Wow. That's pretty great, huh?
I know. Did you read it? Yeah, yeah.
no. I... Last night I left it out for you to read.
I don't need to. I mean, I know it's gonna be great.
Plus, I'm gonna see it... I'm gonna see it when it comes out.
that's why I prefer to buy it.
you know, I'm surprised, like... Yeah.
you know? Like... Watch out! Watch out!
hold on, hold on, hold on.
thanks for lunch. Oh, my God. You so deserve this.
I want to be your fact checker for life.
don't ever think about going anywhere else, ever. Ever.
I promise.
Hi, guys. Hey.
Sophie, these messages are for you.
and a letter came for you. Thank you.
"new Yorker."
we were both young when I first saw you. I close my eyes and the flashback starts. I'm standing there. On a balcony in summer air. See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns. I see you make your way through the crowd. And say hello. Little did I know that you were Romeo. You were throwing pebbles. And my daddy said stay away from Juliet . and I was crying on the staircase. Begging you please don't go.
Hey, what's that smell? What...
Hey, Alfonzo, Alfonzo. No, no, no, no. We said...
we said we were gonna sweat the onion, yeah.
no, this is caramelized. No. Sweat. Sweat, okay?
I don't know where you got that from. Okay, come on, do it again.

I really don't know what this is anymore.
I don't know what we're doing.
I mean, we went on vacation and we didn't spend any time together.
Yeah, because you were busy writing.
I didn't mind. Yeah, but...
I didn't mind. I know you didn't mind.
and you were busy. Come on...
you went to Livorno and I didn't mind.
no, no, no, Sophie! No, no, no... No... Which is what I'm saying.
Victor, we went on, like, a honeymoon and we didn't mind being apart from each other.
it's not supposed to be that way.
we're supposed to want to be with each other all the time.
well, I wish I could tell you that things are gonna be different and that I'm gonna be different, but I...
this is who I am. I know, but I love...
I love who you are.
but I've changed.
it's not working.
I have to go, Victor.
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you but you never come Is this in my head? I don't know what to think He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring And said, marry me Juliet You'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad Go pick out a white dress It's a love story, baby, just say yes 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
Sophie? Hi.
Hi. Hey!
Hi.
can't believe you're here. You look beautiful.
when did you get in? Where are you staying?
I haven't figured that out yet.
well, no need. You'll stay here.
Lorenzo wouldn't have it any other way.
I hope so. How is...
how's our great Lorenzo? Is he as amazing as ever?
even more so. Yeah?
actually, I wanna just... There you are!
I think we're ready in there, and she'll be here any second.
Sophie, this is Patricia.
Hi.
the Sophie?
the Sophie.
it is so nice to finally meet you.
well, I'll see you inside. Okay.
don't trip. As if I'm not nervous enough.
Bye. Bye.
okay.
it's great to see you. I'm gonna go in. I will...
I'II... I'll see you after, okay? Okay. Yep.
Hi. Hi.
Hi, Sophie. I'm so happy to see you.
how are you? How are you? I'm happy to see you.
beautiful. Beautiful.
boy!
we're here. It's amazing.
I just want to say thank you on behalf of myself and my lovely wife, la mia bella Claire!
and now it's your turn.
Well...go on.
dear friends, 50 years ago, I went to Juliet's house in Verona.
I wrote her a letter and I asked her a question.
and two months ago, I received a reply.
and without that letter, none of us would be here today.
Sophie, would you mind if I read out the words you wrote to me?
all right?
dear Claire, 'what' and 'if' are two words as non-threatening as words can be.
but put them together, side by side, "and they have the power to haunt you for the rest of your life.
what if?
what if?
what if?
I don't know how your story ended, "but if what you felt then was true love "then it's never too late.
if it was true then, why wouldn't it be true now?
you need only the courage to follow your heart.
I don't know what a love like Juliet's feels like, "a love to leave loved ones for, a love to cross oceans for, "but I'd like to believe, if I ever were to feel it, that I'd have the courage to seize it.
and, Claire, if you didn't, I hope one day that you will.
all my love, "Juliet
I'll be right back, all right, Gran?
Sophie?
Sophie?
Sophie?
of course!
a balcony. Well.
what are you doing up there?
I'm gonna go.
Why?
because this is really painful.
I should have realized sooner, but I didn't, or I guess maybe I couldn't, but Victor and I aren't together anymore.
and I guess I came back hoping that...
wait, wait. You're not engaged?
no.
but it's too late.
it's clearly too late.
and it really doesn't matter anymore because, honestly, I love you.
I can't believe I just said that.
but I do, I love you. It doesn't...
I mean, it shouldn't matter to you, because you're here with Patricia. Patricia?
and you should be back with her right now.
Patricia is my cousin. She's my cousin.
how is that legal? No...
Sophie... No.
no, no, no. Let me explain!
Sophie, I'm so stupid. There's two Patricias.
there's my cousin, who's here, and the one that I've completely forgotten about.
more importantly, there's only one Sophie.
now, would you please come down?
wait, Charlie. Charlie, stop. What are you doing?
Charlie, what are you doing?
listen to me. Listen to me very, very carefully.
I live in London, a gorgeous, vibrant, historic city that I happen to love living in.
you live in New York, which is highly overrated.
pardon me?
but since the Atlantic Ocean is a bit wide to cross every day, swimming, boating or flying, I suggest we flip for it.
what are you saying?
and if those terms are unacceptable, leaving London will be a pleasure, as long as you're waiting for me on the other side.
cause the truth is, Sophie, I am madly, deeply, truly, passionately in love with you.
you are?
I am.
are you gonna kiss me? Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Charlie!
I can't believe I just did that.
Hi.
are you okay?
please tell me no one saw that.
nobody saw it.
good. That's good.
can you move?
only my lips.
what if we were made for each other, born to become best friends and lovers. I want to stay right here in this moment with you, over and over and over again. What if this could be a real love. A love, a love, yeah. I don't know what to think. Is this real or just a dream?
in my heart is where you'll be. I'll keep waiting till we meet. What if we were made for each other, born to become best friends and lovers. I want to stay right here in this moment with you , over and over and over again. What if this could be a real love. A love, a love, yeah. I write our names down in the sand. Picturing all our plans. I close my eyes and I can see you, and you ask, "Will you marry me?
is it made up in my mind?
am I crazy just wasting time?
I think this could be love I'm serious What if we were made for each other Born to become best friends and lovers I want to stay right here in this moment with you Over and over and over again What if this could be a real love?
a love, a love, yeah. Boy, you know you really make my heart stop, stop, stop. Oh, what if this is real love?
what if this is real love?
Oh, boy, you make my heart stop. You make my heart stop. Yeah.

so girls, don't forget your bikinis and try and stay cool.
here we go.
Connie? When you get a moment, can you just have a walk through?
just give me five minutes to settle in.
morning. Morning, morning.
everything all right? Yeah, I overslept.
how's George?
don't ask. I've been up half the night.
you're all right, you've got time.
man!
ladies, if I could interrupt you a second...
come on. Cover up. ALBERT: Please, ladies behave.
cover yourselves. Cover yourselves up.
woman: Oh, here he is. What if your husbands saw you?
what would they say, eh?
come on, girls, this is important!
thank you, Connie. Thank you.
shut up! Now, shut up.
do you wanna hear what I gotta say or not?
Yeah. Right.
now, listen.
to quote Winston Churchill himself, this ain't the end. It ain't even the beginning of the end.
Oh, for fuck's sake, get on with it.
woman: Get on! Look, ladies, please.
I'm doing me best. Oh, come on.

fuck them. Every other bugger goes on strike, why shouldn't we?
just don't put it like that if you get interviewed by David Frost.
david Frost. I know what you think about him.
it's a bit scary, isn't it?
I feel quite proud of us. You should.
I fought Rommel in the war, you know?
I wasn't once scared like I am when I walk in there, I tell you.
EDDIE: Happy birthday, Sandra. SANDRA: Thanks, Eddie.
isn't it lovely what they did? Come on, get up.
are you coming, George?
no. Go on then.
come on, you come. Connie.
man: Spoilsport.
happy birthday, darling.
Thanks. WOMAN: Happy birthday.
have a wonderful time. Thanks, Albert.
Oh, leave it out, Dave! It's all right, it's the fuse box.
calm down. Of course it's the bleeding fuse box.
ALBERT: Right. Oh, no, here he goes.
ALBERT: Altogether now.
it's bloody Liberace.
Oh, God.
where do you reckon Brenda's got to?
where do you think?
you're joking. No.
your trim. That'll be hanging right off in a week or two.
and I bet I know the girl what sewed it, and all.
come on, then. Chop-chop, or we'll miss the buffet.
want another one, anyone?
I'll have one. Yeah.
George? No.
I'll be up all night. Come on, mate.
Connie, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Please.
come on. Just a little one.
G & T, half a mild. Dave? Salt.
whole lemons. Who's next on the dance floor?
you sure you don't wanna sit down, Sandra?
are you joking? I want a snowball.
George, you ain't even tripped the old, uh... Come on.
no, no, no. It's all right. Please.
do you mind, George, if I have this one?
like to keep me hand in. Jitterbug, twist, all them.
you be careful. We need you on top form tomorrow.
what you talking about?
man 1: Fantastic.
no, no, no. Not being funny. MAN 2: All right. All right.
RITA: Good night. EDDIE: Thanks.
Sandra. Sandra. Sleep well.
Sandra.
happy birthday.
good night. EDDIE: Be good.
SANDRA: Hang on. I don't live here.
wait. What?
now, what was that for? Nothing. I just like you, that's all.
yeah? Come here. Hey.
what are you doing? Not out here.
you're better than that, are you? Actually, yeah, I am.
Graham? Graham. Breakfast.
there you go.
I don't feel very well. Don't you?
you're not hot. It's my stomach.
okay, what's wrong with your hand?
nothing.
well, give us a look, then.
no.
I never done nothing. Honest.
Mr. Clarke again?
it'll be fine, okay?
now, eat some breakfast and get dressed. I'll deal with it.
Sharon? Chop-chop.
Eddie. Come on, lover boy. No, no, just clear off, I'm dying.
we're all dying. We've all gotta go to work.
Eddie?
Oh, you cheeky cow. Come here.
God.
balls.
balls, balls, balls. Bollocks.
yes?
Mr. Clarke? Can I have a word?
of course. How can I help?
you hit my son.
on his hand. Caned him.
and it ain't the first time.
Yes. O'Grady. I remember.
forgot his protractor. And it isn't the first time...
don't care whether it's the hundredth time. I don't want you doing it.
you live on the estate, don't you?
I don't see what that's got... We find boys who come to us from the estate often have difficulty in adjusting to the standards of behavior required in a school like this.
it isn't really their fault.
their parents have never undergone the full rigor of academic life.
the boys can hardly look to them for guidance, can they?
but they do adapt in time.
and I'm sure your son will too, if he's just given the chance.
but thank you for your concern, Mrs. O'Grady.
are you all right? Fuck off.
hold on, is this Sandra's? Yeah, I know.
Connie? Con?
Sandra's at it again, look.
you've gotta say something. She hasn't.
you've gotta talk to her.
don't wave at us, silly cow. We're moaning about you.
I'll do it. No, you can't keep covering for her.
I'll talk to her. Will you?
here it comes. Oh, no.
woman 1: Look at that. We might as well not have a roof.
woman 2: How many times have we asked to fix this?
it's not difficult, is it?
Connie, listen. Albert.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize. Oh, my God.
I didn't realize. I'm sorry. Oh, God. CONNIE: You were saying?
there's a meeting tomorrow.
at Ford's headquarters down in Warley.
you're joking. I'm not.
machinists threatening strike action, they couldn't believe it.
woman: Oh, yes. ALBERT: Yeah.
we'll have to make a good strategy.
they'll have Hopkins and Jones and Grant, miserable sod.
now, who have we got on our side? We've got, um, Monty Taylor from the head office, he's coming.
there's me, two. You, Con, three.
well, that leaves us one short. Why?
little principle I picked up in the war, Eileen.
turn up with more on your side than they've got on their side and turn up when they're least expecting it.
so who's gonna make the fourth man?
Oh, not me. I'm not going.
any takers? No?
you want it? Fuck off.
come on. It's a day off.
Oh, actually. ALBERT: Yeah, you all wanna go now.
Yeah. I ain't having that.
what?
women: Yeah. Go on, Rita. Day off.
go on, Rita. You'd be great, Rita.
go on, then.
Yeah, right. What do you have to do?
all right, Gordon? Hello, Sandra.
think you're going? It's the new Escort. Finally designed something people like. They can get fucked.
that's right. We ain't working no overtime.
me and the boys were saying we'd have gone on strike just having to turn up in a pig hole like this.
you know it's raining here, don't you? Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
see you tomorrow, Connie. WOMAN: I think he likes you.
man [ON TV]: It's going, it's going. The police are being pushed backwards.
there's screaming now. Absolute hysteria.
now you can see the banners are being used as clubs...
Sharon? Don't open my share.
turn the telly off now, there's a good girl. Now, please.
wake your dad up.
wake up, Dad.
right. Pull your finger out. Help your mum.
square eyes, what have I told you?
dad, Martine Clarke's got color. I've seen it.
Martine Clarke's got color, has she?
we'll go around her house and watch it after tea, won't we?
her mum'll be pleased.
look, we'll have color soon. Once you can rent them.
Eddie, don't go promising color.
we haven't even paid for the fridge yet.
and the three piece is still on tick.
now we've got all this unrest at work. What unrest?
Oh, that? You had a vote, Rita.
unrest is when you actually come out and strike. Blimey.
no, don't look like that. I'm only joking.
all right.
I'm proud of you. We all are, aren't we?
sticking to your guns. We had a book going on the shop floor.
no one thought you'd even take the vote so, yeah, good on you. Well done.
ain't just a vote now.
got a meeting tomorrow, all the bosses.
and I'm going.
Oh?
it's all right, I'll plate your tea up in the morning and then if I'm back late, you can just heat it through.
apparently, you go to a Berni Inn on the way there.
that's snazzy. Isn't it?
RITA: It'll be all right, won't it?
Yeah, of course.
we don't have to do anything. The men will do all the talking.
RITA: No, I mean, it's not too posh in there, is it?
I'm wearing the right stuff? No, you'll be fine.
I'm so glad you're here.
after you, ladies. Gentlemen.
thank you.
woman: Here you are, sir. MAN: Lovely.
ALBERT: Do you ever worry about your waist?
MONTY: You're joking.
[Whispering] That steak. Béarnaise sauce.
it's Monty. He always insists on coming here.
as long as the union's paying.
Rita. Yeah.
word of advice.
when we get there, don't let them lure you in.
if they seem to be asking you a question, keep your head down. I'll handle it.
above all, if I nod, you nod. Got that?
right.
that nice, was it? It's lovely, thank you.
I couldn't eat another thing.
Oh. Mr. Dawson. I'm sorry, we weren't expecting you until...
it's quite all right. It's no problem.
Oh, and there's four of us. You might need an extra chair.
right.
woman: Two teas.
on a previous occasion, in a free vote, the girls agreed to the new grading structure.
they did not agree, however, as to where they would end up on it.
which is why we're sitting round this table.
look, I understand what the girls are saying. I just don't...
I'd rather you didn't speak for the girls, Mr. Hopkins.
none of us here knows what's in their heads.
HOPKINS: The fact remains there's a formal grievance procedure in place and the machinists' case will be heard.
what we can't do is let them jump the queue.
Peter, look, you know me. I ain't got no ax to grind with Ford.
am I right or am I right? HOPKINS: You've always been fair.
exactly. Ah, we're all men of the world.
let's cut to the chase, shall we? We'll reconvene in two weeks' time.
ALBERT: Monty. Listen.
we'll reconvene, we'll come back down here again for the day and then at that point you can guarantee to look into the girls' complaint.
the thing is, Monty... That way you can go back to your bosses and say that the strike's off because of how you've handled today's negotiations.
we can go back to the girls and say they're now your number-one priority in a few weeks' time.
that seems very fair.
I'm not so sure the girls'll be too happy.
the girls will be fine.
as long as they know they're not being fobbed off by the management.
the union's setting the terms. That's what's important.
bollocks. What?
I'm sorry, Albert, but it is.
three hours we've been sat here.
that's what matters to the girls"?
how you qualify to talk about that, I do not know.
here. Have a look at this.
there.
you put them together. Go on.
it's Ford property, I believe. Oh, stop it.
we have to take these different pieces and work out how they go together.
because there ain't no template, is there?
we have to take them and sew them all freehand into the finished article.
the same with the door trim and God knows what else.
that is not unskilled work, which is how you've regraded us.
Christ, you need to take an exam to get on our line.
please, miss, l... No, it's Mrs. O'Grady.
Mrs. O'Grady, I understand your grievance...
well, I really don't think you do. It's not difficult, though.
we're entitled to semi-skilled and the wages what go with it.
bring this to the meeting... Hang on.
and as regards to this queue-jumping business, well, we put this complaint in months ago, didn't we?
it's just you've done nothing about it.
and we all know why.
that's because women have never been on strike before, isn't it?
you just thought you could forget it and we'd all go away. Well, I'm sorry, but it isn't gonna be that easy because we're not going anywhere.
we're gonna do what we said we would.
no more overtime and an immediate 24-hour stoppage.
and where it goes from there, well, it's up to you.
if you'll excuse me, I've really got to be going. Thank you very much.
thank you.
good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you.
you think I like looking stupid? I didn't know what she was gonna do.
MONTY: You didn't know they were in her handbag, pull them out?
look at his face. Oh, don't worry, you were great.
MONTY: Thank you very much, Albert. Thank you very much.
I knew, I knew. It's up here, you see.
I wanted clever, Rita, that's why I picked you.
Oh, stop it. When you pulled out these cuttings, oh, that was amazing.
it was. I never expected that, that you'd come prepared.
Oh, no, he was right. I was nicking them.
Yeah, Eddie uses them to patch the tent up for when we go camping.
all the same. Listen, don't worry about Monty, I'll handle him. Don't worry.
can I have them back? Oh, yeah.
Cheers.
what are you gonna say to them?
you tell them. You what?
this is your fault.
all right. Hold that.
right.
everybody out.
woman: I can't believe it.
it's all right.
I could do with a cup of tea.
CONNIE: I could do with something a lot stronger than that.
now, I realize this is my first day in the job and it may be that I am missing something here, but when we were elected two years ago, it was on a wave of optimism that Labour would utilize its close relationship with the unions to develop manufacturing industry so that it would better serve the employer and the employee.
Yes, I think that was in the manifesto.
it was. Trust me.
so, what have you been doing since 1966?
l... Two years this department has had in which to make a difference.
shall we see what has been achieved in the last 12 months?
twenty-six thousand strikes in the United Kingdom, with the resulting loss of 5 million working days.
unions and management barely talking to each other, productivity levels through the floor, and our balance of payments, the wrong side of catastrophic.
it's hardly the stuff to set the champagne corks popping, is it?
thank you. See yourselves out.
here you are, babes, you forgot your flask.
I love you Dave, cheers. You too, darling. Good luck.
you get stuck in, girls.
thank you. Thank you.
Monica, that's yours. Cheers, love.
happy with that.
woman: It's a holiday.
EDDIE: What's this? A mothers' meeting?
Hey, cheeky sod. Are you all right?
how you getting on? Give us half a chance.
good luck. See you later.
come on, ladies, let's hear you.
Bye. See you later. Cheers, Eddie.
what have you done to your eyes?
it's amazing, isn't it? My friend showed me how.
scouts everywhere. That's how Twiggy got discovered.
up west, you dozy sod, not Dagenham.
you never know.
we'd better shut this gate.
I've spelt it right, haven't I?
close the gate.
I know. At least they know we're serious, eh?
not as helpless as they thought.
come on then, girls.
no more seats today, Mr. Ford.
come on, girls, let's get together. What if we form a line or something?
line up there. Yeah.
CONNIE: Hold the banners up.
we need some in the back. WOMAN 1: Standing?
woman 2: Like that. WOMAN 3: Come on, then.
that's it.
here we go.
like this? Yeah.
they're running low on finished seats.
so get these down to the Cortina line, then come back for the Escorts.
they're calling. Come on.
anyone fancy a cuppa? Yeah.
tea's up, ladies. Come on.
Yeah, put that down a bit.
that's gonna hurt your arms.
get me Tooley.
stand by, girls, could be trouble.
Hello, girls. WOMAN: What's Brenda got?
BRENDA: Tea's up. Bananas, apples, pears, the lot.
thanks for the ride, Arthur.
he's lovely. Brenda, you never.
BRENDA: Why not? He's gorgeous. WOMAN: I would.
just as I was leaving with the fruit, he goes:
I believe all the workers of the world should unite." So I thought: I can help you with that one straight away.
so I did.
Hey, Peter. Bobby here. What can I do for you?
we've got another dispute, I'm afraid.
another one? Who is it this week?
it's the women.
CONNIE: Quick. Quick, quick.
come along, girls.
you're gonna get soaked, love.
RITA: Oh, no. They're gonna drip, aren't they?
it'll pass. MONICA: What are we gonna do now?
pubs ain't even open. Monica.
just wanna have some chips.
I suppose we've done a full day, haven't we?
woman 1: We have, haven't we? WOMAN 2: Yeah.
I have gotta get down the dogs later.
Yeah. I did promise my mum I'd cook her tea.
did you? Yeah.
Oh, sod it. We've registered the protest, haven't we?
Yeah.
go on. School's out. Yeah!
home time.
MONICA: Onwards and upwards, Rita.
well done, girls. WOMAN 3: See you.
Hey, and Rita, well done.
it was your gob what got us here, wasn't it?
Sandra?
I've just been round to your house.
I've just been round to your house. Why?
I thought you would've gone home ages ago.
no.
I'm lucky if I can get the lads to hold out for a full hour.
look, I wanted a little chat.
you fancy a cup of tea?
I can't. I'm sorry, I've got stuff to... I'm buying.
go on, then. Seeing as it's pelting it down, a quick cuppa won't hurt.
over there by the window. Over there.
I'm dripping all over the floor.
come on, Albert, spit it out.
Yeah.
sorry. It's all right.
this dispute's got nothing to do with what skill level you are.
ford decided to give you less money because they can.
they're allowed to pay women a lower wage than men.
all over the country, Rita, women are getting less because they're women.
you'll always come second.
you'll always be fighting over the scraps.
until you... We get equal pay, yeah.
Yeah.
what I don't get is why it's so important to you.
I got brought up by my mum. Me and me brothers.
she worked all her life and she paid my Aunt Lil to take care of us during the day.
and it was hard.
especially as she was getting less than half.
and there was never any question that it could be any different.
not for her.
someone has gotta stop these exploiting bastards getting away with what they've been doing for years.
and you can.
you can, Rita, believe me.
what about Connie? I mean, she's shop steward. We voted for her.
but this needs a leader.
someone to inspire the girls, to make the points clear.
and that ain't Connie. Not at the moment.
not with George the way he is.
I've already spoke to her. She's more than happy for you to have a go.
more than.
look, don't say nothing now.
just sleep on it. Will you?
do you want to wait in here? Ey?
do you want to wait in here? No, you're all right.
it's tipping it down. Please. I'm dripping.
I know. Get in.
I'll get it all over your car. Come in, quick, quick, quick.
thank you.
Oh, my God. Gosh, you're soaked.
I'm so sorry. It's fine.
I'll ruin your car. We met before, actually.
do you remember, in the corridor? Yeah.
I've been hoping to run into you for a day or two, actually.
Oh, yeah? Um...
I was wondering if you'd sign a letter. I'm making a formal complaint to the headmaster about Clarke's use of the cane.
what?
he seems to think my son... Sorry, I mean...
you were there for the same reason I was?
Yes. He was indiscreet enough to mention you.
of course.
I think he was suggesting we were hysterical and desperately needed to calm down.
I had it all straight in my head what I was gonna tell him and what I was gonna say.
it's just... Oh, you can't talk to Mr. Clarke.
I mean, nobody can. He... You have to listen.
he's a bully. Which is why he beats them.
Yeah.
Yeah. Go on, then. Give us a pen.
Thanks.
it's stopped. Yeah. That's just my luck, isn't it?
Thanks.
I know you're not mentioning it because you're being polite. It's just...
you know, when we met in the corridor, I was really upset, and I never usually use that type of language.
don't you? No.
because I called Mr. Clarke a complete cock.
Oh. Oh! Did you? Fair enough.
well, he is.
here they come. Left a bit of a puddle, now.
it's all right, David's getting in the back.
that dress, I've seen it before, it's lovely. In Vogue.
Oh, thanks. It's Biba.
is it? Well... Well, it's still gorgeous.
have a good day, yeah? You too. Be good.
and you.
hell, Sandra. I think you've had a bit of shrinkage in the wash.
hot pants. Mary Quants.
give them back to her, they look painful.
I think they look lovely. Thanks.
it's like what Brenda said, isn't it? This ain't Knightsbridge, it's Dagenham.
if you wanna get spotted, you gotta stand out more.
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
yesterday were great, weren't it? RITA: Being on strike?
Yeah.
it's a glimpse, isn't it? Of how it could be.
well, that's what it's about, isn't it?
Pitch-bleeding-black. I couldn't see me hand in front of me face.
finally when he turns the lights on, it was actually stuck to me bottom lash.
blimey.
I'm here, just. Oh, Christ. Connie? Con?
Rita, l... No, I just wanna say something.
sorry, I just, um...
if I was to get a bit more involved, you know, with Albert, it's only because I've got a gob on me.
you're the heartbeat of this place, always have been.
Rita, look at me, all at sixes and sevens.
you can do this and you should.
here we go.
man!
Brian.
Hello, Brian.
is that a cotton bob in your pocket or a hard-on?
woman 1: What's he doing? WOMAN 2: Having a fiddle.
here, Con. Pass them out, girls.
woman 1: Yeah, come on, Rita. Go on, Rita. Give them hell.
ignore it. Ignore it?
standard issue, day after a walkout.
have you seen the language?
your aggressive disregard for the existing complaints procedure.
tone of that? They don't mean it.
so why are they saying it? That's how we've always done it.
all the other strikes. It's like the rules.
RITA: Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
sorry, we ain't playing that game. We ain't your men.
we're us. And we certainly won't be addressed in this manner.
no.
all those in favor of not only maintaining but increasing our current action by going to an all-out stoppage until we get the same rates of pay as the men?
what? Equal pay?
why not? Because that's what this is really about, isn't it?
we're on the lowest rate in the whole factory despite the fact we've got considerable skill.
and there's only one possible reason for that.
it's because we're women. Yeah.
and in the workplace, women get paid less no matter what skill they got.
which is why, from now on, we gotta demand a level playing field and rates of pay which reflect the job, not whether you've got a dick or not.
this strike is about one thing and one thing only: Fairness.
woman 1: Yeah. WOMAN 2: That's right.
equal pay or nothing. Yes.
all those in favor? Yes.
everybody out.
well, it's got nothing to do with me.
an all-out stoppage?
also, the specifics of this strike, they've widened out a bit.
Christ.
shit.
fucking Ada. Equal pay? What were you thinking, Monty?
it wasn't me, it was Albert. He went behind me back.
really, Monty? He's a loose cannon.
you wanna haul someone over the coals, he's your man.
the bloody troublemaker.
get him in.
I tried to protect you, Albert.
but you're gonna get such a fucking bollocking.
come on, then.
this is awkward, Albert. You know that, don't you?
it jeopardizes a whole raft of other negotiations that the unions are already at loggerheads with management over.
look, comrade, basically, you encouraging these women to get all militant...
it shifts resources away from the blokes, who are the ones at the coalface.
we ain't unsympathetic, but as a union, we have to remember who comes first.
the Communist Party and Marx himself said:
men write their own history." That's "men," Albert.
but didn't he also say, "Progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex"?
or was that a different Marx? That was Groucho, was it?
equal pay across the board.
you telling me that ain't worth fighting for?
of course it is. And you know it.
I'll tell you something.
this Rita has got a bigger set of balls than you three put together.
and she ain't scared to lay them on the line neither.
and I, for one, am gonna help her.
and if you are what you say you are, an organization pledged to support its members, then you'll get off your lazy, fat arses and you'll help her too.
good fucking evening.
BRENDA: They can't expect us to carry on being graded unskilled.
unskilled, my arse.
we're here to put across our point of view about what's going on. It ain't fair.
and also about how it's a part of something bigger, much bigger.
what about a little bit of support this way?
come on, mate.
you might learn something if you just listened.
RITA: The time has come for all women to say "enough.
we do not and we will not accept this any longer.
Ow! Dad, the pan.
bollocks!
no, Daddy didn't mean that.
thank you. Thank you very much.
that was magnificent. That was wonderful.
be back in a minute.
RITA: You're doing the same work for Ford here in Liverpool that we're doing for them down in Dagenham.
so you know that our job is skilled.
she's a bit of all right.
RITA: Think beyond that.
I'm asking you to strike now for all women, not just machinists.
leave him alone. He's gotta concentrate.
go, get back. Have a word with him.
and what is right is that every single one of us is entitled to the same pay as men.
that's my girl.
will all those in favor please put your hands in the air now?
RITA: Well...
how'd you get on?
we slaughtered them. Every single one of them came out.
it was incredible though, Eddie.
well done.
go and check on the kids. Give them a quick kiss good night.
RITA: Gonna take some money, all right?
Oh, no. What happened?
dad.
tell him to give it another go, yeah?
I'm off. See you later. You're all right taking them to school, aren't you?
of course. You're all right with that?
everything's all right, isn't it? Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
no reason. Have a good day. See you later.
this is me last one.
ey? The shirt, I just noticed.
Oh, yeah. Sorry, I forgot.
forgot washing Monday. I'll do it tonight.
right.
take care of your dad. GRAHAM: Bye, Mum.
have a good day.
Oh, dear.
come on. Come on, girls.
women [CHANTING]: Equal pay.
equal pay.
equal pay.
which way? Wait a minute.
no, Rita, it's here. It's down this way.
it must be up here. Anyone got a map?
there.
there it is. WOMAN 1: Oh, my God.
woman 2: Oh, here we are. WOMAN 3: Here we go.
we want respect. We want respect.
we want respect. We want respect.
get the banner up. Look, get that.
there. Equal pay for women!
man: I'll support you. WOMAN: Thank you for your support.
equal pay for women.
women workers for equal pay.
we want respect. MAN: Darling, over here.
woman: We want respect!
Hey! Hello.
I finish at 4. Give us a call, love?
I never thought we'd get this backing.
show us what you got.
hold on, girls!
we're not entirely unfurled, look.
I know the feeling.
don't look, boys.
announcer: In their campaign for equal pay, women workers of Ford Dagenham brought their protest to Westminster today.
some didn't need much persuasion to demonstrate their feminine charms.
it's interesting, all this politics, when you get down to it. Oh, sorry.
how long will they stay out? Must be starting to bite.
as long as it takes. Does your husband support you?
he has to. Yeah.
Yes, of course he does.
and we all supported the men when they went out on strike. Yeah.
does it bother you that you've been described as the Revlon revolutionary?
have they been in touch about doing some modeling?
eyeball, be sure to get me in focus, man.
make sure you take the lens cap off this time.
Hey, let's play some spades. - Hey, Tommy's got to go.
all right.
are you out, Tommy?
when we see Old Glory flying
there's a lot of men dead
so we can sleep in peace at night
when we lay down our head
my daddy served in the Army Where he lost his right eye
but he flew a flag out in our yard
till the day that he died
he wanted my mother, my brother my sister and me
to grow up and live happy in the land of the free
now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
a mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye
man, we lit up the world like the fourth of July
don't take my leader book.
and Uncle Sam puts your name at the top of his list
and the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
and the eagle will fly And there's gonna be hell
when you hear Mother Freedom Start ringing her bell
and it feels like the whole wide world
is raining down on you
okay, open the door. Open the door.

all right, we're coming down. We're gonna need cover.
sergeant Shriver, I saw your last range scores.
you ever thought of sniper school? - I used to.
I'm getting out. I'm getting married, sir.
you're a hell of a shot. - I know, sir. Thank you, sir.
puffing on Boot's cigar pretty hard, ain't you?
I know, sir. Thank you, sir. I know, sir. Thank you, sir.
all right, men, listen up!
we have a bit of a surprise for you.
the good folk of Sergeant King and Sergeant Shriver's hometown, Brazos, are throwing them a getting-out parade.
you represent the United States Army.
I expect every one of you to be on your best behavior.
here's a list of things you will not do while on leave.
you will not drink and drive.
you pick up a young lady, let her drive.
let her get the DUI.
you will not beat up civilians!
you will not fuck anyone underage.
I say again, you will not fuck anyone underage.
you will not beat your wife, you will not beat your kids. You will not kick your dog.
am I understood?
okay. I'll see you in Monday's formation, 0700. That's it.
enjoy your stay in Brazos.
did you get her on tape, man?
no, I didn't get her on tape. - It's incriminating.
she said she was 18, so fuck all y'all.
welcome home, Brandon! - Welcome home, Steve!
well done, Shriver!
guys, welcome back.
welcome home. - Thank you.
Hey, baby! - Hey, baby!
welcome back, soldier!
Hey, Michelle. Come here.
beauty.
God bless the U.S.A!
two boys from Brazos, best friends since they were kids, distinguished themselves by leading Brazos High football to a memorable, barn-burning division championship...
all right, Steve! ...and have gone to war and returned as heroes.
staff Sergeant Brandon Leonard King.
we honor his exceptional courage, loyalty and selfless service with this Purple Heart and Bronze Star with Valor.
let's hear from one of Brazos' own.
Yeah! Speech, Brandon, speech. - Speech! Speech! Speech!
come on, Brandon.
sign them up, Sergeant.
come on, Brandon.
I wasn't... I wasn't planning on giving a speech.
I was just...
I was just over there trying to do my job, like everybody else.
trying to bring my men back safe.
you know, most of my men ain't from Texas.
it's kind of hard for me to describe to them what I love most.
ribs at Smitty's, or the way they keep the beer in tubs at the Ajax Bar, being out at the ranch with my folks.
on the bus ride over here, I saw a truck hauling onions.
and I couldn't get the window down, 'cause I... I wanted to smell them.
see, onions smell like home to me.
they smell like Texas... - That's right, Sergeant King.
we're over there killing them in Iraq so we ain't got to kill them in Texas!
for purple mountain majesties
above the fruited plain
america, America
God shed His grace on thee
and crown thy good with brotherhood
Tony, how are you, son?
Brandon.
ma!
Oh, God! Let me see you.
Oh, you're home now, baby. - I'm home.
let him breathe, Ida. - Oh, he can breathe.
dad.
good to have you back, Son.
thank you, sir. Thank you. It's good to be back.
Brandon King! - Yes, ma'am.
Mr. King! Good to see you, sir. - Sergeant King!
good to have you back.
Yeah, well, baby.
Hey, Thomas? You going with us?
Yeah, I'll be there in a second.
I am real proud of you, son. - Hello.
I'm pulling some strings, trying to move your Private Rodriguez from the hospital in Germany to an Army hospital stateside.
anything else you need, you call me.
thank you, sir, I will.
I'm real grateful about Private Rodriguez.
I plan on seeing him when I get out.
if you come to Washington, you call me.
I'll take you around Capitol Hill and show them what a real Texas hero looks like.
I'd love that. I'd love that.
private Rodriguez's family could use a word of encouragement.
we are going to take very good care of your son.
thank you.
your brother's gonna be fine, just fine. - Thank you.
all right, Augustin. You stay out of trouble.
shorty Shriver! - Hey, Brandon.
I got some making out to do. Sorry.
y'all so cute.
have a seat. - Welcome back, baby.
thank you. - We missed your fine ass.
Oh, man. - Here, soldier.
get you some tequila.
Oh, look, it's Brandon, King of Texas. - Come on, Brandon.
Oh, my lord.
you back in Texas now.
I love Texas! I love Texas! - Welcome home, boy.
it's good to be home.
all right. Y'all listen up.
to Steve and Michelle.
Oh, my gosh.
Finally!
give it a spin on the dance floor. Come on.
Yeah.
I want to dance. - I formally release him - into your custody. - Thank you.
I'm all right. Don't worry about old Steve.
are you okay?
no, you go ahead. I'm gonna sit this one out.
but we ain't danced yet, babe.
I know. Just... You go. I'm gonna sit this one out, all right?
you and Brandon kill a bunch of those Iraqis over there?
Yeah, Steve, we winning this thing?
look. What we need to do is just drop a 10, 000-pound bomb on one of their cities every time they hit us.
no more of this urban combat bullshit.
I'm tired of going and killing a Haji in his kitchen and his bedroom.
Fucking-A. - When you going back, Steve?
I'm done.
me and B.K. are getting out.
you know, but if I had to do it again, I'd be a fucking sniper.
one shot. One kill. Let me be the faceless enemy.
I'd go back tomorrow to get that Haji bastard that killed Preacher.
preacher was Tommy's best friend over there.
I fucking loved that guy.
he took a round in the face. It blew his jaw all the way off.
then he took one in the neck. - Hey, Steve.
he was dead before he hit the ground.
Yes, sir?
just take out Haji and his whole fucking family.
send them right back to Bible times.
what about you, darling?
no, thank you. - Sure? I'm one hell of a dancer.
no. I don't doubt it, but... - Hey.
Hey, my wife said no. You fucking deaf?
I get it, man, no problem. You're the hero.
Tommy!
Tommy! Tommy!
Ah, shit. It's on!
get him, Tommy. - Oh, shit.
Tommy! No, Tommy!
at ease, soldier. You hear me? You hear me?
soldier, at ease.
fucking ease! Listen to me!
all right, you good? You good? Huh? You hear me?
all right. Calm down, let's get a drink. Come on, man.
Hey, it ain't a party without a fight!
Oh, snap! Tommy.
okay. It is midnight, and all the shit the U.S. Army done issued to your ass still ain't accounted for.
and when you turn all the rest of this shit in, you gonna have to owe about $1000.
Oh, Eyeball, I am getting out.
man.
that's what's up, man. - Except I'm keeping this.
good choice. Good choice, as your face has been known to scare kids and make dogs bark.
you're funny.
Where's my phone?
hello. - Bran?
Hi, Mich.
Yeah, I'll be right over. Dude, come on.
you all right?
he's got a gun.
what you doing, Steve?
what the fuck do you think?
you hitting the rack?
Yeah. Do you want to know what...
what pisses me off is just...
soon as I get dug in, those fuckers are gonna move us out.
I'm gonna have to do this shit all over again.
Roger that.
what the hell?
your mama made all these by hand.
she loves you like a daughter.
steve was yelling at them like they're alive.
then he kicked over the table.
a lady at the base said not to rush the fooling around.
but you know Steve.
he'd been drinking.
he couldn't...
he hit you?
he got rageful.
did he hit you?
I caught a backhand.
I told him, "Get the hell out.
he's so goddamn drunk right now, he thinks he's on a mission outside the wire.
you know he loves you more than anything.
what up, Tommy?
Hey.
I just woke up and I was here.
what are you guys doing?
fucking RoboSoldier dug a ranger grave in Michelle's front yard.
you want a beer? - Yeah.
ain't it time you and Jeanie open your wedding presents?
jeanie threw me out until I get my shit together.
I was wondering, maybe I could stay out at the ranch, just a couple days.
I was thinking maybe we'd all go, get out of town for the day.
what about RoboSoldier?
fucked that one!
that's my boy.
read the card.
uncle Vern and Aunt Tilly "hope you and Jeanie get a bun in the oven soon.
out of the way!
you know, it used to be, the protocol for a busted marriage was to return the wedding gifts, Thomas?
read the card, Shorty.
to Tommy and Jeanie, for a long and happy life together.
from Tom and Charlotte.
out of the way!
there she is! Morning, sweetheart!
Oh, yeah, baby.
what's the matter, Robo?
you wake up on the wrong side of the spare tire?
shorty, read the card!
Hey, princess, don't throw up in there, man.
I'm gonna need a beer in a minute.
shorty, read it!
from Steve and Michelle.
can we fucking cease fire for a little while?
Yeah, sure.
God damn it!
I'm sorry. - Brandon, you motherfucker.
God damn!
an old granddaddy rattler!
right where you would have stepped, cousin.
I should've let it bit you.
God damn!
good shooting, B.K.
she's beautiful.
I'm used to that shit, baby.
just 'cause y'all are so busy... - Careful. Careful.
Mr. T. - "I pity the fool.
I pity the fool that let Preacher cut their motherfucking hair.
all right. You've been busting my fucking balls all day.
how are you gonna explain that black eye in safety brief on Monday, huh?
I walked into a door.
you and Michelle walk in the same door?
look, I fucked up.
I don't even know what happened.
okay, I kind of blacked out.
all I know is I remember waking up in the trunk of Tommy's fucking car.
well, it ain't gonna happen again.
you copy me?
do you copy me? - I said I know and I said I fucked up.
come on. Watch the venom. - You watch it.
don't fucking touch me with that shit.
watch the venom, man! I think I broke skin.
I'm gonna fuck you up. - Come on.
look at y'all.
crazy.
it's over now, baby.
what are y'all doing over here?
Tommy?

I shouldn't have shot that shit up.
Sarge Shriver. - Sarge King.

all right. - This new squad leader, he's a Baptist.
I'm not a Baptist.
all right. He's a real Baptist.
listen, man, you got to get a fucking grip.
you smell like a fucking brewery. Come on.
that's 'cause we were drinking last night.
Tommy. - Wait! Come on.
okay. You're all good to go.
says here you have orders to report to the First Brigade.
not me. I'm getting out today.
Brandon Leonard King? - Yes.
out to the First Brigade on the 22nd.
this is a mistake.
it's all there.
you leave on the 22nd, shipping back to Iraq.
sub-section 12305, Title 10.
by the authority of the President.
you've been stop-Iossed.
lieutenant Colonel?
sergeant King.
I teed you up for a recruitment pitch in Brazos, and you gave me an onion patch.
it's what came to mind, sir. - What's your problem, Sergeant?
I'm supposed to be getting out today. Now they're shipping me back to Iraq.
you understand why it's important we win over there?
why we need good soldiers like you? - Yes, sir.
you have extenuating circumstances? You gay or pregnant?
sir, you know me. I'm a squared-away soldier.
because I have an extenuating circumstance, Sergeant.
it's called a war. It's in Iraq.
I know, sir. I volunteered to fight in it.
I ran over 150 combat missions for you, no complaint.
contract says stop-Ioss is only in a time of war.
this President said the war's over, so legally...
you a lawyer, son? - No, sir.
but after doing right by this Army,
I'm getting burned by some fine print in a contract.
now the President himself said... - The President is also the Commander-in-Chief.
I think he trumps you either way.
with all due respect, sir, fuck the President!
fuck the President?
Yes, sir. He's not over there fighting this war.
he's not there seeing his buddies burned alive in Humvees.
I lost three men last month, and I almost got the rest of us killed.
those were my men, too, and I lost more than that.
you're an excellent leader, and you are going back.
for 11 more years?
it won't come to that. - How do you know?
I think the President trumps you in this matter.
this, sir, is bullshit, and you know it!
lieutenant, you just heard Sergeant King disobey a direct order.
Yes, sir. - I also perceive him to be a flight risk.
escort him to the stockade so he can readjust his attitude.
you're making a big mistake. - I'm doing you a big favor.
end of discussion.
make sure he ships to the First Brigade when it goes out on the 22nd.
Roger, sir.
come on, hotshot. - Don't you fucking touch me!
Steve, I fucked up real bad. - Hey, man. What? What'd you do?
I put down a couple guys and now I'm AWOL.
what the fuck... - I got stop-Iossed back to Iraq.
shit!
Oh, okay. Look, take it to Boot. You're gold with him, he'll fix it.
Yeah, Boot was trying to send me to the stockade.
I shook loose and I took off in your Jeep, man.
you definitely have fucked up now. - I know.
I know, I just got triggered. I lost my shit.
all right. Wait, look. All right, get a grip, calm down.
I'll try to figure out what's going on here, and cover your six.
Thanks, man. I knew you would.
I'll hit you later.
come on in, Sheriff.
Ida, listen to this.
these MPs came to me and said Brandon's gone AWOL.
how in the hell can he be AWOL if he's getting out today?
boot's hopping mad.
he called me personally to put out a statewide APB.
get Brandon to turn himself in and get this thing sorted out.
I don't understand. They stop-Iossed you?
how can they do this? - They're doing whatever they wanna do.
with a shortage of guys and no draft, they're shipping back soldiers who's supposed to be getting out.
it's a backdoor draft, is what it is.
what about Steve?
Mich, I don't know. Some of us are getting it, some ain't.
this cannot be happening. No! You almost died over there.
what do you want to do?
you want me to take you to Mexico till this blows over?
no, no, no. Out of the question, Mom.
I ain't dragging my tail across to Mexico.
I'm getting my keys.
Brandon.
listen to me. If you're spooked, it's okay.
there's no shame in that. - I ain't scared. I'm pissed off!
this family is done fighting this war.
he ain't scared, Roy. He's just being sensible.
I just don't want him to get in any deeper, is all.
maybe ruin his whole life.
I ain't gonna let it go that far.
ruin his life? How about getting himself killed?
God damn it, Ida. - Hold on! Hold on!
the Senator said to my face if I ever needed anything, he'd help.
that is a big-ass mistake.
you go out of the chain of command, over Boot's head, you're doubling your trouble. He's gonna make an example of you.
I ain't worried about Boot once I explain the whole thing to the Senator.
I just need to run up to D. C. right now and get this sorted out.
okay. I'll take you.
you can't. They're gonna be watching y'all.
you can't. They're gonna be watching y'all.
they won't be watching me. I'll take you.
Michelle, Steve would have my ass if I let you get mixed up in all this.
he could be next.
let's go. - This is wrong, Brandon.
steve don't talk much about being over there.
sand.
fleas.
flies.
heat.
boredom.
or you can get shot at.
or blown up.
that's pretty much it.
sheep on the highway.
where?
in Iraq.
big-ass flocks of them.
yeah?
Jeanie, it's me.
I need you to cover my shift at work tomorrow.
sorry I woke you up.
no, I was up. I was up.
and covering your shift's no problem, since neither one of us has a fucking job.
what? - Tommy drove his car into our work, drunk as fuck. He got two DUls in the last two days.
what the hell's happening to these guys?
are you all right out here?
I thought I saw somebody down by the drain.
you okay?
Yeah, sure.
you should try and get some sleep.
I'll be all right, Mich.
I know what I'm doing.
listen, Mich, you need to be getting home.
you need some dry clothes.
Michelle Overton!
you taught me everything I know. You made me everything I am.
can't be anything else, sir. I'm no good as anything else.
then stop your drinking! - I will, sir.
all I wanna be is a soldier.
I just want to go back to Iraq. I'm gonna be better.
Hey, baby.
lf I ever... - Put Brandon on the phone.
put him on the phone! - All right.
Hey, man. - Where the hell are you, man?
I have a situation you need to step into right now.
I've been trying to reach you all night. Where you been?
I've been at the fucking jailhouse all night, trying to bail Tommy out of a DUI shitstorm.
God damn it! - Boot is about to kick Tommy out.
squad leader is supposed to be here, and that's you.
Steve, I can't.
I'm on my way to D. C. To see the Senator.
you're what?
you're fucking AWOL, and you're taking Michelle to fucking D. C?
I'm gonna cut her loose at the state line.
you haven't proved it to me yet!
I need you to handle this until I get back. Just a couple of days.
this better be the last time... - It can't wait that long.
...you drive drunk! - And you, my friend, you are in deep fucking shit with Boot.
I'm gonna make this up.
it's all I got.
this is everything to me. Army's my family.
I know I'm a little sideways, but give me one more chance, please.
what's up?
gonna head north on the 55 into Memphis.
long way around.
there's something I got to do. I'll drive.
in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
congratulations, man.
it'll take a lot more than water till I'm saved.
Thanks, man. - Attaboy, Preacher. You saved him.
I think you need some more blessing, bro.
preacher and the chaplain baptized a lot of guys over there.
come on, sit down.
just wanted to pay my respects, sir.
very grateful that you came.
you said you had a bad feeling about Paul's last tour?
why'd he go back so many times?
he was stop-Iossed.
couldn't find a way out?
there were people right here in Memphis on the lay low.
stop-Iossed soldiers filing a lawsuit.
but he wouldn't listen.
excuse me.
and how would someone find these guys with the lawsuit?
depends on who wants to know.
I'd like to know.
it started out just like any other day.
we were manning a checkpoint, but we came under attack.
and standard operating procedure is to pursue the attackers, and...
go on, we want to know.
we followed them into an alley.
I led my men into an alley.
preacher, Paul, was covering our flank.
we got hit from both rooftops.
RPGs, small arms, bullets, explosions...
it was an ambush.
leading your men into an ambush is standard operating procedure?
leading your men into an ambush is standard operating procedure?
that's enough, Michael.
I remember...
I was yelling at him across the alley.
and he got on the phone to call for reinforcements, and he must have seen somebody drawing down on Thomas, 'cause he fired a few shots in that direction.
and his rifle jammed.
that's when...
that's when he got hit.
did our son suffer?
no, ma'am.
no, he was... It all happened real fast.
my brother's life was wasted over there.
your brother died doing what he knew in his heart was his duty.
and he died in the arms of his best friend.
I can tell you that.
he's the one that sent the picture right after we lost Paul.
read the back.
he calls, sometimes, late at night.
I think he's been drinking.
you keep that.
thank you, sir, I will.
we want to thank you, Sergeant King, for coming.
because I know that these meetings must be very difficult for you.
Yes, ma'am. - Thank you, Sergeant.
thank you for coming.
thank you.
good luck getting out.
that was real nice, what you did back there.
so you wanna go find this place Preacher's brother told me about?
I'm going straight to D. C. End of discussion.
all right.
damn.
wait here! - Brandon.
wait here!
it don't matter.
you got my shit, asshole.
get the fuck out of here, man.
I want my fucking shit.
break yourself, fool. Break yourself.
all right! All right! - Calm down.
stay down!
okay, Hajis.
on your knees, hands behind your heads.
now, I said!
do it!
hands behind your head.
you having fun, Haji? You having fun?
who wants to play "Let's start shooting people"?
you're up.
you're fucking up!
right in the back of your head.
Oh, yeah, yeah. You ain't dead yet?
just give him his shit! - Come on now.
we're just getting started, here.
your shit's over there, man. It's over there.
just go get it. - Oh, yeah? What? I can't hear you.
I can't hear you. What'd you say?
who's next?
you, you're next.
y'all better start praying to Allah, son.
man, please. Please don't shoot me.
Brandon, don't shoot. - Oh, shit!
Oh, my God.
I've got everything.
I've got all our stuff. Okay?
on your faces. On your faces! - That's enough.
put the gun down.
get away! - Don't you hit me!
give me the gun.
give me the gun.
give me the gun, or I'm gonna leave you here right now.
on your face! - I swear!
on your face! - I swear I ain't kidding!
you're gonna need some stitches.
here.
let me help you. - I got it.
let me help you.
before Steve came home, they told us how a soldier could be a danger to himself or other people.
you think I'm a danger?
I've been knowing you since third grade.
I think we've got both kinds of danger here.
I'm sorry.
what's going on?
same shit every night. Drinking, fighting, hookers.
and I got babies in here.
cops will be here soon.
Hey.
you laying low here?
how'd you find this place?
brother of a guy in my squad. - Guy pushing a lawsuit in the lay low?
didn't tell you about our first case, did he?
army came down hard.
locked the guy up, took everything.
even his wife left him.
I ain't got no time for no lawsuit. - Good.
there ain't a judge in this country going up against the military while this war is on.
and let me tell you something about laying low.
can't get a job. Can't cash a check.
and they're probably tracing your calls.
now go on in there and brush your teeth so we can leave, okay?
my youngest boy, we can't even take him to the doctor.
you're on the run 24l7.
and God forbid you get pulled over for having a busted taillight.
you going to jail.
so where you headed now? - North. Canada.
I can't put my family through this no more. Thanks.
what about you? - D. C. Going to see a senator.
why don't you write a letter to the editor while you at it?
listen, man, you should try to reach my guy, Ron Carlson, old peacenik lawyer, works out of New York, takes people north.
he'll help you get across the border.
listen, man, I ain't interested in dealing with no shitbag coyote.
suit yourself.
but we've been on the run 14 months, and I can't take it no more.
here's the number.
take it.
keep it. I got it memorized.
another way out of this, I would have done it.
good luck.
y'all hurry up, now.
you feeling all right? Yeah?
here, let me see about you.
Oh, fuck!
you told him where we were.
he's come to take me home. I'll leave you my car, okay?
thanks a lot.
Hey, baby.
good morning.
morning.
God damn, soldier.
what happened to you?
what you gonna tell Boot? You walked into a fucking door?
I ain't telling Boot shit.
Yeah, you are. I'm here to take you back.
you ain't taking me anywhere.
okay, tough guy.
let me lay it out for you.
boot said if I get you back on base in the next 14 hours, all charges are dropped, no stockade.
I don't need you making deals with Boot for me.
Hey!
you don't know what I've been through to scrape the shit off of your shoes.
you ought to be thanking me.
you steal my Jeep and you run off with my girl.
that ain't how it happened.
you know that. I was trying to help him.
and that's what I'm trying to do. This is a straight deal from Boot.
it's what's best for him. - What's best for me?
what's best for you, Steve?
showing up here in your Class A's.
what kind of deal did you make with Boot? Huh?
you took him up on sniper school, didn't you?
God damn!
you re-enlisted?
how could you do this? - How could you run off with Brandon - for three fucking days and not call me? - We don't call you and you re-enlist? That's bullshit! And you know it.
how could I not?
Michelle, it got real clear to me that this, this is safe.
it's safe?
and when are we getting married, Steve?
when I get back from my next tour.
when you get back?
you've been saying that to me for five fucking years.
it's clear you've made your decision.
this is good for me.
I got a future in this.
this is something that I can be proud of.
did you really see me selling cars for Rainey?
get out of here.
look, I'm sorry. Hold on. Please?
don't. - Please come here.
don't.
please, just... - Don't. Get out of here!
fucker, get out.
I said get out!
fuck!
did that really just fucking happen?
fucking motherfucker!
that was fucked up.
what did you expect?
God damn it. How did everything get so fucked up?
you, Tommy, now Michelle? - What's wrong with Tommy?
he's too messed up, man.
I can't get through to him like you can. He just won't listen to me.
look, come on.
come on. We'll go and we'll knock out another tour, and we'll come home.
another tour?
you're always talking about how snakebit this war is, how they won't let us fight it the way we need to win it.
now you want to go back?
that makes no fucking sense.
like this makes any fucking sense?
this isn't who we are, man.
man, look, we didn't get through all this shit together just for you to end up like one of these AWOL shitbags.
we ain't like these guys. We're soldiers.
we stand for something, man. We're from Texas.
all right. Stow the Boot talk, man.
you let him talk you into going back? That's fine. You got a right to be stupid.
well, fuck you, man!
I did what I had to do for the time I had to do it, and I ain't gonna do it anymore.
you can take that back to Boot.
you're the only person who thinks you're getting out of this!
boot called the Senator. He knows what you're up to.
you're AWOL, Brandon.
no senator is gonna help you. You're done!
Steve, you know what they're doing is wrong.
I'm not going back.
I'm fighting this thing.
Hey!
watch your six.
sergeant King, I've told you several times already, the Senator cannot see you.
ma'am, I'm a decorated soldier.
now, a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star got to mean something.
I understand.
but you're a fugitive.
no U.S. Official, no government official is gonna help a soldier on the run.
go back to your base before you get arrested.
tequila.
you know, it's happy hour. You can get two for one.
well, lucky me. Double, double.
can I join you?
the way I see it,
Steve's married to the Army.
it's everything to him.
I can't go another year without having him touch my face.
I can't be a military wife.
I just ain't that strong.
well, Michelle, you know, life is very long, and...
Brandon. ...you're very young.
shut up and drink.
Yes, ma'am. - We're both fucked.
same again.
all right, men. You all straighten up and walk sober, all right?
Yes, sir. Sergeant Shriver, the man in charge.
what are you doing with a fucking bottle, man?
you ain't even supposed to be drinking.
come on, man. What are you...
where are you going?
over to Jeanie's.
jeanie don't want you, dummy. That's what a restraining order means.
come on, Tommy. You can stay at my house, man.
I'm gonna make it better.
swear to God.
just propose again. We'll get married again.
only thing you proposing is to get locked up, man.
let's get out of here.
let's get out of here.
all right. Come on, man.
you know I ain't gonna let you go over there. Let's go.
you talking about Jeanie?
you can't even manage your own woman.
no, I didn't mean it like that, Steve. Steve.
no, seriously. No, come on. - Tommy. Tommy!
I'm sorry.
Steve, come on. I'm sorry.
I smell a woman, and it ain't a nurse.
then who?
Hola, Private Rodriguez.
sergeant King!
my first visitor.
you found me.
I did.
and who?
Michelle.
Hey, Rico.
sergeant Shriver's Michelle.
sunny blonde hair, green eyes.
steve showed us your picture a million times.
sergeant King came to see me with his best friend's girl!
it's a long story. - Yes, sir, I bet it is.
sit, man. I got time.
good to see you. - It's good to see you.
how's my mother? - She's good. She's missing you.
Yeah. And my brothers?
they're getting big. Growing up.
they strong? - Seem to be.
taking after their brother.
not as handsome. - Close.
I'll let you guys talk.
all right. - Thanks for coming to see me.
she sounds cute.
How're you feeling? - Feeling good, sir.
just as comfy as a Humvee. - You think?
I wouldn't have thought, but... They taking good care of you?
first-class treatment, Sarge.
good. So I don't have to talk to anybody?
no, sir. - All right.
nice break.
thank you.
that's impressive. - Sloppy.
what can I say? - You're in, though.
come on. - I think she's a butter face.
yeah? - She's hot, but her face.
but does she give a good bath? - She's got some soft hands.
well, there you go. That's what matters.
I haven't felt anything else, but that'll change.
soon as I get the rest of this. - All right.
man, I had this thing, like a dream, all right?
you were at the bottom of a swimming pool, and I dove in to try to save you.
but I couldn't.
it's okay, man.
you did save me.
I'm right here.
and seeing stuff, man?
here, at night?
sounds like a fucking horror movie.
guys screaming, nightmares...
Sarge, we got out just in time.
I mean, Haji's new bombs...
you don't want to survive, man.
sounds crazy, but I feel lucky, you know?
they want to send me back.
I hope you told them no fucking way.
I mean, I might go back.
cause if I got killed, my family would get green cards.
sir. - Yeah?
could you move me out of the sun?
okay.
so, I'm sorry, but I got to ask.
what you doing with Sergeant Shriver's fiancee?
they broke up. She's just giving me a ride.
she was giving you a ride before or after they broke up?
not like that.
Michelle's close to my family.
she's just helping me out. She's somebody...
what?
you should hear the way you sound, Sarge.
you a Jody.
it's time for you to go back to your room, Private Rodriguez.
Jody got your girl and gone
sing it.
I don't know the words. You sing it.
ain't no use in going home Jody got your girl and gone
you watching this one?
nice shot. - Now we're even.
what you laughing at? You lost.
that's pretty funny.
give you a hand. - Dumbass.
help me push it. - Yeah.
thank you.
it's fucking strong. - Is it?
I'll be in touch, Rico.
tell the boys I said, "What's up?" - I will.
I signed up, thinking I was gonna go over there and protect my country.
my family.
we wanted payback for 9l11, and you get there, and you realize the war wasn't even about any of that.
the enemy ain't out in the desert.
they're in the hallways and rooftops, living rooms, kitchens.
everybody's got a weapon.
everybody.
nobody knows who's who.
the only thing you can believe in is surviving.
protecting the guy to your left and the guy to your right.
side by side, willing to die for each other.
by the time you start seeing good friends' bodies held together by a belt after a car bomb, you get a kill-or-be-killed mentality.
it's okay.
no, it ain't.
Michelle, I'm worried if I tell you these things, you're gonna think differently of me, and I...
I couldn't stand that.
I ain't gonna think that.
our last mission, in the alley, well, when Rico got hit,
I looked in his face, and most of it was burned off.
I had to go in to get Steve.
I knew he was in trouble.
I'm done with killing.
and I ain't leading any more men into a slaughter.
you have to call Carlson.
I know.
Mr. Carlson.
my name is... - No names.
all right. What's the problem?
I'm a Staff Sergeant, a squad leader, two tours, Afghanistan and Iraq, and I just got stop-Iossed.
they're shipping me back at the end of the month.
there's so many of you guys out there.
I've heard it before. It's the same story, and you eventually call me.
do you understand what I do?
I strip away who you are. I set you down in a foreign place where you're gonna live the rest of your life pretending to be someone else.
do you want that?
I can't go home. I can't go back. I got no other options.
I need your services.
I won't be able to discuss this further over the phone.
do you have some money? Like a grand?
I have a few bucks.
well, when you get a grand, start driving north toward New York City.
not a bad price. - Thank you, sir.
come on. This is a good opportunity.
rainey said that people will just line up to buy a Cadillac from a vet.
Yeah, not with a BCD.
it's not like you're gonna hang it on the showroom wall, Tommy.
what's a BCD?
it's the big chicken dinner.
it's what we call it in the Army.
it's a Bad Conduct Discharge.
we gonna shoot this shit up, or what?
that shotgun loaded?
what's the first rule of weapon safety, Tommy?
always assume every weapon is loaded.
Yes, sir.
sorry.
where are you going?
I'm going back to the bunkhouse, write a hit song.
don't feel like shooting shit up today 'Cause we'll put a boot in your ass. It's the American way
Hey, Uncle Sam...
later, guys. - All right, man.
later, Tommy.
brought to you courtesy of the red, white and blue
of my red, white and blue
I spotted you guys from a mile off.
Oh, well.
what happened?
I just had a run-in with a couple guys.
Yeah. That kind of shit happens when you're on the run.
all you guys get popped eventually.
is this a package deal?
just one for now.
you thought about this? - Yes, sir.
cause one-way means one-way.
you go, you're going for good, unless you get fucked with extradition.
pardon my French.
I don't want you calling me up crying how you can't go to grandma's funeral back in Tennessee.
Texas.
we're from Texas.
whatever.
I just want it all laid out straight.
canada's not that bad.
I just had a guy up there, got married to a real sweet local girl.
loves Toronto.
says it's a lot like New York.
I ain't so crazy about New York, so far.
you got any other options? Like, what about Mexico?
look, I don't know shit about Mexico.
here's your new I.D.
they'll fix in the photos before you leave.
day after tomorrow, somebody will meet you at this address in Buffalo.
take you over.
you got the money? - Here.
no refunds, right?
got it. Half now and half across.
go make your calls.
say your goodbyes.
Hi, Mom?
he did what?
when?
I don't...
let me call you back, Mom.
Tommy shot himself out at the ranch.
left, face.
this flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation and the United States Army as a token of appreciation for your loved one's honorable and faithful service.
come on, Ida. Let's go.
look who came home.
that's for fucking running out on us.
and that's for coming back too fucking late.
and that's on general principle.
fuck you.
you're throwing everything in your life away.
you stupid...
y'all gonna get yourselves killed, you know that? Do you hear me?
shut the fuck up.
so you just go over there and you do your fucking duty.
you see this?
you see this?
this is you next.
Steve.
you don't fucking belong here!
I don't... I don't even know you anymore!
maybe you don't.
bullshit! I've known every thought in your head since we were fucking stealing Playboys from the fucking bus station.
that was a long time ago.
then, please. Tell me.
tell me what you've been thinking, because nothing in the last few days has made any fucking sense to me at all.
you know that box inside your head?
that box inside your head where you...
you put all the bad shit you can't deal with?
well, mine's full.
and it's spilling out.
Steve, it is full of all the people I got killed.
preacher.
Randy.
Harvey.
Thomas.
all the rest I've lost in this fucked-up war.
think how many people would have fucking died if you wouldn't have been there! Including me!
Steve, I didn't do what I was supposed to do!
I fucked up!
if you don't fall in beside us, it all comes apart.
the ranch always felt so safe.
you'll find another place and make it safe.
sir.
damn.
you okay?
across that border, that ain't gonna be me coming up the other side, Mich.
it's gonna be the ghost of me.
Brandon, please.
and never the ranch.
never you and Dad, never Brazos.
this war ain't never gonna be behind me.
I'm sorry, Mom.
bruckner,
Rodriguez,
naughton,
Stevens, - Williams... - Bye-bye, sweetheart.
we love you, sweetie.
we love you, honey! - Adios, Augustin.
Bye, sweetheart. - Take care of her.
Bye, sweetie. - Write to me.
I'll keep those e-mails coming.
we're proud of you. We love you.
better e-mail me, Shorty!
take care of each other.
all of you come back safe.
God bless you.
TESS: And love slipped the bonds of restraint.
his touch was like a cosmic "yes."
eustacia [ANGRILY]: "Fuck you," screamed Kelly. "Fuck you to hell."
Scott stepped back from the cell door as the gob of spit flew. "Fuck you."
GLEN: This matrix is what Hardy meant by "the ache of modernism."
crap.
nicholas: Inchcombe knew too well the dreadful mundanity of murder.
but Patel was stricken.
Inchcombe realized his lack of feeling was almost...
pathological.
"I've been wearing the wrong size all my life," says Katie.
"I was always popping out. Turns out I'm a 30 GG," she says.
now my bras finally fit.
though Simon prefers me without one.
we can go round mine, if you like.
and watch your dad farting into a sofa?
a taxi?
in Ewedown?
come on. Where are we going?
nowhere.
Glen, can I tempt you? Oh, wow, thank you.
uh, I often take something snacky to Nicholas this time of day.
I know how the brain needs feeding. Mm.
so how you settling in?
great.
the last writers' retreat I was at, I kind of froze my balls off, you know?
screeching fire doors and curried lasagna, and a needy poet, from whom I still bear the scars.
well, we try to keep it peaceful here. Far from the madding crowd.
may I? Oh.
well, it's paradise.
in Ewedown? What are you doing there?
I haven't told her yet.
why not? You keep saying you want to be with me.
well, I can't tell her just like that. It's 25 years. A marriage.
Ah. Come on, Nicholas.
or I'm gonna get in a taxi and find your farm.
no. Come up there and I'll drag you out.
no, don't.
I wanted to be with you. I thought you'd be pleased.
well, of course I'm pleased.
Nadia, go to the pub and stay there. I'll come when I can.
are you going to tell her?
nicholas: Just give me a couple of hours.
cock pie.
BETH: How's the worker? Good, actually.
just about to embark on forensics.
well, give me your pages and I'll get started.
reckon I might pack it in a bit early today.
need to think about my blood smears.
might take a drive, have a pint.
stir the old grey matter up.
who were you talking to just then?
Judy. She said the Impala contract should be through in a day or two.
I could come with you.
what? For a drive.
I don't know when we last went out.
Mm. This is absolutely yummy.
or we could go into Hadditon, get a meal.
but what about the guests?
Mary's got Casey to help.
but l... I'm supposed to be thinking, you know, about...
you can run it by me. I'm good at forensics.
Andy, can I tempt you?
Oh, uh, we've got a new academic. Glen, American.
turns out he's working on Thomas Hardy.
said he might have some farming questions.
needs an expert yokel, does he? Would you mind?
Oh, and the... The writers are eating alfresco tonight.
could you check there's no bird shit on the seats? Sorry.
you okay?
Yes.
nicholas and I are going out to dinner.
now.
fucking bingo.
what a dump.
Yeah. We could walk up the garage.
Oh. I'm supposed to be helping my mom up at Stonefield.
they keep you busy. Yeah.
you never stop, you.
bet them writers are wankers.
it was called From Hearth to Heath:
the Doomsday and Revelation in Victorian Verse.
what was it about?
well, you know, pale poets on laudanum and dark towers and sunless seas.
a little Sturm und Drang in a teacup.
did it sell?
well, of course, my kind of books aren't about sales, that's not why I write. So, no.
TESS: So, what are you working on next?
GLEN: Thomas Hardy.
is there anything left to say about that maudlin bore?
excuse me, but there's nothing dull about Hardy. That is a misconception.
at least you've been published. I'm seething with envy.
I'd love to be published. I publish myself on the Internet.
Oh, do you earn money doing that? No.
GLEN: What do you write? Lesbian crime.
I'm here picking up tips from the master.
Beth? BETH: Yeah?
why don't I just pop out on my own?
well, I'm ready now. Come on.
is that?
I mean, are you wearing that?
it just looks a bit hot.
you know, Hadditon's always packed with pissed Londonites on a Friday.
I doubt we get a table anyway.
let's do it properly next week. Make an occasion.
I'm always taking you for granted. I'm vile, I know.
you should kick me, really.
who is she?
what?
Oh, come on, Beth.
tell me who.
look, it's nothing.
it's been once or twice, that's all. It's just...
Beth, it's not anything. Who is she?
so she's on her way in, the bride and groom are...
just a researcher on Radio 4. What's her name?
Nadia. Nadia Patel. Patel? She's in your book.
no. No. I met her when I was on Desert Island Discs.
you put her in your book. Well, just the name.
desert Island Discs was a year ago. Yes...
so "once or twice"?
I was going to tell you. Ha-ha!
I've had enough of this. Beth. I'm a ruin, I know.
but I've been in a real state about this.
l... I didn't want to hurt you. Oh!
BETH: How could you lie to my face?
nicholas: Can we talk calmly? There are people out there.
BETH: You looked me in the face and lied.
for God's sake, we're surrounded by novelists.
you bastard. Beth, we're like a pair of compasses, Oh, don't you dare.
joined solidly at the top, but with the ends able to roam in freedom.
that's her, isn't it? Are you keeping her waiting?
we've talked a lot about the creative mind, and we agreed it needs a certain freedom to explore.
take your freedom. I can't live like this anymore.
it makes me feel worthless. Calm yourself down.
go set up home with Patel. See if she does your tax returns.
do you love her? Is she young?
for heaven's sake... Is she?!
if you leave here tonight to be with her, don't come back.
nicholas: Beth, you're making fools of us both.
liar!
I didn't know they provided material too.
Beth does everything for him, you know. Types his manuscript, deals with his agent, makes his female characters convincing.
she even came up with the name Dr. Inchcombe.
DIGGORY: No wonder he's bored.
I hope she takes him to the fucking cleaners.
at the end of the day, this is why I'm glad I'm single.
will she take him back though? That's the question.
would you? Well, I'd be torn.
he's far too up himself. Yeah, but what about their farm?
splitting up all this? Must be worth a fortune.
BETH: Nadia Patel.
"Gazelle eyes," "Tantric sex."
she's very rash, making him choose.
why would he choose me?
I thought you weren't going to come. I was busy. Rowing with my wife.
where are we going? Home.
to your farm?
we could have gone on just as we were.
Yes, but you said you wanted to be with me.
Yes. In London.
now and then.
big glass of Rioja, please. And I need a room.
sure. How many nights?
don't know. Just one?
are you here for the writers' retreat? No, but I'm a writer.
well, journalist.
I don't mean to pry. I'm just really nosey.
I'm from here. Sort of.
well, it's a nice place. I love it.
I keep meaning to leave, but... Hard to get away.
my mom's house is just up the road.
you're not staying with her? She's... She died.
have that on me.
and here's your key.
up the stairs, right in front. You can't miss it.
didn't think I'd see you tonight.
bit of an atmosphere at Stonefield. Tell me everything.
marriage. Remind me never to try it.
Andy, you're just a sex object. No one would have you.
GLEN: Ahem. So the Hardiments have lived here for centuries, huh?
no. About 20 years.
still strangers, by local standards.
Andy, uh, come look at Ingrid. I, uh...
I think she's coming into heat.
she's very nice, Beth.
Yeah. I owe her a lot.
husband's kind of a sleazebag, huh?
we'd say "prick" here, actually.
or wanker.
that's good. We might even call him a fuck.
that's good too.
can I help? It's going rotten underneath.
can I have a look at Ingrid? Look, it's... It's falling apart.
Yeah, well, I can do that. Beth...
he won't last five minutes.
GLEN: Oh, Jesus. He's been translated into Icelandic and Swahili.
what an output.
I need my book to be a success.
I need a tiny reward for all my endeavors.
I need a dump.
nicholas: Beth. BETH: No, don't touch me.
don't you dare. I'm sorry.
not good enough, not anymore. I'm sorry.
you do what you like, then you're sorry?
I hate myself. I hate myself.
BETH: Where were you?
nicholas: I drove her back to London. Took all night.
BETH: You drove her home? I finished it. She was in a state.
BETH: So it's over? NICHOLAS: I'm sorry.
[crying] I don't know why I'm like this.
I couldn't manage without you.
BETH: I've got to go to the bottle bank.
let's talk later. BETH: Yeah.
the goat's come into heat. NICHOLAS: Has it?
I love you so much.
me too.
I've just seen the Hardiments kiss and make up.
the hat's on. Looks like she's taking him back.
when the hat's on, it means don't speak.
so peace is restored.
Oh, for fuck's sake!
I don't like cows. Yeah.
they exude bovine malice. Yeah.
these girls are killing machines.
they don't like Americans either. Very funny.
ANDY: It's Winnards Farm.
lady there died a while back. Place is empty.
think it's being robbed? Nah.
probably just kids.
nothing to do around here except make trouble.
what if it's bad guys?
don't you have a blunderbuss or a fowling piece or something?
ANDY: Used to belong to my dad, this place.
Really? But it all went tits up.
the land was flogged to a consortium and the house sold to Londoners.
the Drewes. So this is your ancestral pile?
was.
born in that room up there.
you must have been pretty resentful.
and Y: Oi! This farm's mine, big nose.
Hey, what are you doing? Who are you?
Andy, you moron. It's me.
Tam?
I didn't even recognize you.
well, you won't do it that way.
then help me.
used to do bits of work for your mom.
been keeping an eye on the place since she died.
what kind of work, graphics?
no, I do horticulture now. You're a gardener?
wow, this is a great old house.
Thanks. Do you want to buy it?
I'm not the property-owning type, no. I prefer my life to fit in hand luggage.
that why you're back, to flog it? Yep.
ANDY: Make a nice second home for some banker wankers.
look, Andy, if you want it, why don't you just make me an offer?
because, sadly, I'm still prey to the economic forces that threw the peasant classes off the land.
unlucky.
ANDY: Tam.
what the fuck have you done to your nose?
Oh, come on, Andy. Aliens came and took it.
she's completely different.
what was she like before? What's the story?
there isn't one. Oh, come on.
it was nothing. Decade ago. Just a teenage thing.
you should find someone you're in love with.
stupid prick. You saying you love me, frosty tits?
you first. You're the girl, you say it.
I love you.
fuck off. I love you!
Romeo and Juliet, huh?
something classy in the wood shed, huh? Heh.
would you do him? No.
what about him? He's gay, you dobbin.
so? Oh.
swipe.
JODY: Ben Sergeant. I'd walk through fire to do him.
CASEY: The drummer? JODY: He's not just the drummer.
he writes all the lyrics. It's his band. He's the fucking genius.
not Steve Culley, or any of these wankers. It's Ben.
okay, yeah. L... I'd do Ben.
I wanna be her, in that dress, with him licking my teapot lids.
Yeah, me too.
so has the muse shone on you, Greg?
I've been pretty distracted most recently by those delicious cookie things Beth brought around this afternoon.
Oh, yes. Of course, we call them biscuits here.
and by the place itself, the people.
I sometimes wish I could get distracted.
Ten-page-a-day man, rain or shine.
Wow. That's scary. Ten pages a day, how do you do that?
Oh, Greg, Glen.
I wouldn't presume to give an academic tips.
matter of fact, I read one of your books...
another distraction. - I thought it was decent stuff.
well, how do I do it? I just get on with it, Greg.
[MIMICS NICHOLAS] "We call them biscuits here."
to the muse. The muse.
however you find her.
writers [SOFTLY]: Cheers.
who's that?
GLEN: That's Tamara Drewe.
nicholas: No, it isn't. GLEN: I met her with Andy.
good God, what's happened to her? She had a nose job, Dad.
nicholas: She's completely different.
GLEN: That's what Andy said.
poor Tamara, she's such a sad girl.
she used to come help you wash the car, didn't she, Nicholas?
nicholas: When she was a teenager.
she liked a bit of family after her dad left.
is that Tamara Drewe that writes a column in one of the Sundays? Used to.
writes for The Independent now. Oh.
BETH: She spent weeks going on about her nose job.
was her old one an awful conk? Yes.
BETH: She's poured herself into those shorts.
hope they don't give her thrush.
hello. Sorry to intrude.
Hi, Tamara. Poppy. How are you?
I love your new hooter.
Thanks. It's not actually new, it's just smaller.
Tamara. So sorry about your mom.
Thanks. Are you staying down for long?
I'll have to. There's so much to be done.
well, let us know if we can help.
could you spare a pair of strong arms?
I've got a skip coming tomorrow, and...
Nicholas?
I'm available. I do skips.
BETH: Nicholas? Oh, bug...
thank you, everyone. You're very kind.
is Andy around at all?
Oh, l... I can't spare Andy.
he's making a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons. Heh.
we'll soon have that dry, don't worry. Heh-heh.
she's had Glen down there helping her all morning.
I hope she realizes he's here to work.
can't believe what a difference her nose makes.
I think it's a mistake. Taken away all her character.
come on, she looks 10 times better. Huh.
and she knows it. I found those shorts really irritating.
going around with half her bum hanging out. I mean, why?
to annoy people like you. Hmm.
I might get a pair myself.
of course you wouldn't. Why not?
because you're not desperate, are you?
there was always something desperate about Tamara Drewe.
GLEN: Why did you change your face?
changing my face is the best thing I ever did.
I don't care what anybody else thinks.
you think it would work for me? Maybe, if you did the wrinkles too.
Oh, you're just coming on to me now.
in your column, you write about yourself. Does that come easily?
not easily. It just feels right.
my first novel is definitely going to be autobiographical.
your first novel? You're gonna dash one off, just like that?
Heh. Ideally, I'd like to make it into fiction before I'm 30.
then maybe a swimwear collection, chat show, pasta-sauce range.
what?
life sure comes easy for the beautiful.
you know, before I had the nose job, I had no problem being taken seriously.
maybe when they removed that bit of cartilage, they pulled out my brain by mistake.
what do you think?
she's single, you know.
well, it's not exactly a relationship. We have an occasional thing.
Zoe doesn't wanna be tied down... Not Zoe.
Tamara.
you should get in there. Marry the girl. Then you could live in your ancestral home again. No. Not her type.
Andy, you know, the trouble with you is that you think like a loser.
I know this because I'm the loser that all other losers come to for tips.
I am a loser's loser.
I'm a pedigree loser.
had a graphics business, went bust.
then with my great business acumen, I invested in a polytunnel full of ganja.
spent six years stoned out of my box. I'm only just getting it back together.
besides, even if I was the last man in the world, Tamara Drewe wouldn't have me.
why not?
I dumped her. Oh, you are a loser.
I was 20.
and my mates thought I was cradle-snatching.
and they used to call her Beaky. Beaky?
Beaky?
TAMARA: Boys know nothing.
I've been reading Inchcombe's Dose. The bit where Dr. Inchcombe finds himself having thoughts about the dead guy's daughter.
you describe her light smattering of freckles and her striking profile.
so who did you base her on?
have you noticed me?
because I've noticed you.
you're making yourself ridiculous.
Nichol-arse!
a man can dream, huh?
Oh, write, you numbskull.
man: The best ham I've had in ages. WOMAN: Good.
BETH: How's Thomas Hardy?
I'm wasting my sabbatical. Oh, dear.
I've been writing this book forever. Don't know why I can't finish it.
two years behind on my delivery date, and Fantail could ask for their chickenshit advance back.
I can't write. I'm fucking constipated.
it's a disaster.
Oh. Uh, sorry, Glen. Um... I've gotta grab Andy before he rushes off.
Tamara's asked him to do up her house.
Why? She knows how hard he works for me.
is this all his fan mail?
Yeah. I do a couple of sessions a week to keep on top of it.
pretty good at forging Nick's signature.
why don't we have a proper chat about it?
always used to help Nicholas... You'd do that? You have time?
I'll just, uh...
Tam?
Tam?
Tam?
got some color charts for you to see.
what color do you think it should be in here?
well, I was thinking, um, this one for down here.
and, um...
this one for the bedroom. Okay.
so, uh, what do you have to do to get a cup of tea around here?
make it. Tea, sugar, fridge.
I'm off to work.
this is our village! Our fucking field! GUARD 1: Go on.
CASEY: Get off! JODY: Come on, bastard. Let us in!
guard 2: Kiss your mother with that mouth? Fuck off.
get on, shove it.
bullshit! Fuck off!
swipe is fucking finished! Steve Culley is a...
fuck off. Fran has been shagging that tosser.
FRAN: Steve, stop it! Come on then.
I'm Tamara Drewe. What?
I'm supposed to be interviewing you, for The Independent.
it was scheduled for later, but is now a good time?
crowd [CHANTING]: Swipe! Swipe! Swipe!
Swipe! Swipe! Swipe!
they should let us in for free. RYAN: Too right.
they come here, drink our water, use our fields.
and they leave all their crap in our drains.
RYAN: Nice girlfriend, mate.
Ben. Ben!
what are you doing? That's Ben from Swipe.
and he's got his dog. Ben!
Ben! Ben!
that's Boss.
up.
boy. Come on.
Hi, Boss. There.
not allergic, are you? To indie drummers?
maybe.
who the fuck's she?
I've seen her up at Stonefield. She's got a nose made of plastic.
so who are your influences?
everyone asks that.
I mean, what do you want me to say? Phil Collins?
animal from The Muppets?
this your house? Yeah.
do you want to buy it? No.
I want something else.
how come she gets Ben? I've loved him since March.
would you like a beer? Yeah.
Maureen Tucker. Who?
Moe Tucker. The Velvets. Five-foot-nothing.
used to stand up to play.
put the snare drum on its side and whacked it with mallets. Mentalist.
you write a lot of songs. That's pretty rare for a drummer.
Yeah, well, everything you've heard about drummers is complete shit.
you mean they don't spontaneously combust?
only sometimes.
any more questions?
who are you?
ANDY: You know anything about this dog, Tam?
you want some breakfast, Tam?
Tam?
how goes the opus? Fine, Nicholas, just fine.
GLEN: It's his most obscure novel, The Well-Beloved.
most people have never even heard of it.
it's about a young guy of 20 who falls in love with a beautiful young woman.
then when he's 40, he meets the woman's daughter and he falls in love with her.
and finally, when he's 60, he meets her granddaughter.
Oh, he doesn't.
Yeah. Falls in mystical love.
hardy was the same in his life too.
even as he aged, he only had eyes for young women.
it's like, in one essential way, he never grew up.
in his trousers. Ha. Yeah.
he was still at it in his 80s, you know.
snow on the rooftop, fire in the cellar.
Ha-ha. Why won't it come for you, Glen?
the way you talk about it is so engaging.
do you wanna try?
well, there's an academic style, you know?
who are you writing for? Who's your ideal reader?
if wrote the way you spoke, you'd make me want to read Hardy.
Really? Yeah.
if you wrote like you were talking to a friend. Try it again.
no, no, no. It's not as if I'm avant-garde.
I simply pander to popular taste. Your books are far more than that.
just airport fodder. I think I write them in my sleep sometimes.
I wish I wrote so well awake.
your prose are so economical, so vivid, like the greats.
like Raymond Chandler. Oh, come on.
Graham Greene. I'm just earning a crust.
you created Inchcombe.
if only he were real. He's my kind of man.
Yes. Sophisticated, jaded, but so vulnerable.
cynical, but a man of total integrity.
my books don't say anything remotely profound.
I can't pretend to be an intellectual, not like the professor here, illuminating our ignorance with his critical glow.
I love prose. I turn a decent plot. That's pretty much it.
excuse me. NICHOLAS: People like crime fiction, because no matter how violent or shocking, it comforts them.
secretly, Nicholas hates all this.
these crime weekends really take it out of him.
let me help.
Oh, well, they need dusting with this.
I went to my room today, and I wrote for three hours. The time, it just vanished.
that's great. That's brilliant.
I feel like a man who's just passed a gargantuan stool.
Oh, super.
sprig of mint on top.
the real secret of being a writer is learning how to lie, because that's what storytellers are, thieves and liars.
"the basis of all excellence is truth." Samuel Johnson.
Ben, I'm trying to write.
please, Ben, it's a new story.
it comes from my heart, it's about my mom and dad.
Andy.
let me dog in, will you?
Cheers, mate.
he must like kissing plastic. He doesn't really love her.
he's just on the rebound from losing Fran.
numbing his pain with loads of empty rampant sex.
what he really needs...
is a 15 year old from Ewedown? So? Stranger things happen.
he's only 10 years older, and that's nothing. If he met me...
if he just met me... It'd be love, right?
Yeah. But I'd settle for sex.
Cooer, in your parents' bedroom? Still, I suppose being an exhibitionist is part of his job, strutting about on stage.
he doesn't strut. He's a drummer.
he sits on his ass.
he's very good-Iooking, isn't he? Poppy YouTubed him.
we both got quite hot and bothered.
is that his car? The yellow Porsche. Yep.
Yeah, a bit brash, vrooming through the village.
fancy our Tamara bagging a bona fide rock star.
she was such an ugly duckling. She must be thrilled to bits.
we're not open for another hour.
good.
I mean, she used to be so funny. So human.
what does she see in that London knob?
he even wears fucking makeup. How did she get so shallow?
Andy, are you really going on about her now?
Oh. Where are your manners?
I'm sorry.
bide your time, you big prick.
Penny: Come here, you wretched beast!
stinking animal!
filthy hound!
here.
what's this? What does it look like?
which finger?
wherever you want.
that one's nice.
stick it on that one.
those girls could have aborted. Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out.
it beats me why you people want to live in the country.
you have no sense of responsibility. It's not our dog.
Hello, Penny. How's tricks?
Oh, Nicholas. You're looking good. Terrific coat.
Oh, what, this old thing? You look like royalty.
well, I try. Can't wait for your next book.
Inchcombe's such a saucepot.
giles always says, "What are you reading, Penny?"
you've got steam coming out of your ears.
what's the ring saying, Ben?
Hello, I'm a ring. Will you marry me?
I didn't know.
didn't know what?
that you're in love with me.
the ring is saying, "I'm platinum with a long guarantee."
will you marry me?
Yes.
what? BETH: Oh, is Tamara there?
she is being proposed to.
Shh. There are writers here trying to write.
BETH: Hello.
Oh, um, this is, uh, a Buff Orpington. He's a bit peaky today.
they're not great layers, but they're very decorative. Heh.
we're, um... We're fully organic here.
though, uh, I like to think our champion product is, uh, the written word. Heh-heh.
nicholas: The famous Ben.
swipe, eh?
no, Swipe's over. I thought the whole world knew that.
it wasn't on Newsnight, no.
Ben's engaged to Tamara. Isn't that lovely?
he'd just popped the question when I rang.
and she said yes?
we're delighted for you both.
why is he on a fucking chain?
he was out of control.
how would you like to be chained up?
he was chasing livestock. He could have got shot.
they shoot him, I'll fucking shoot them.
unbelievable.
here, pooch. I think the word is gobshite.
BETH: I hope he makes her happy.
it's hard for girls when their dads walk out.
gives them bad taste in men.
what's that supposed to mean?
Oh, just saying Tamara's father left when she was a girl and...
that is 10-pence psychology.
you don't know what you're talking about.
Ben: Poor little man.
"my Buff Orpingtons." Oh, the written word.
what a fucking freak.
TAMARA: It's a shame the ring doesn't fit.
why didn't you bring one of mine along when you bought it?
I didn't know you then, did I?
so when did you buy it?
was it for someone else?
you bought it for Fran, didn't you?
so?
it's yours now.
she never wore it. She didn't want it.
did you ask her to marry you? Just as a gesture, when she started seeing Steve. That backfired.
look, it's you I wanna marry now.
the ring... The ring doesn't matter.
the ring's just a consumerist piece of zinc.
what matters is that I love you.
do you?
with my whole heart.
and all the other stuff.
[IN DEEP VOICE] Like me brain, me entrails.
me pancreas.
it all wants to marry you.
BETH: She wondered if you had a delivery date in mind. I said Easterish.
Oh, mind that cocoa, it's hot.
there's a few invites. I'll pop them there.
you just tick the ones you want to go to.
Oh, and, uh, Tim wants to know if you'll do your Christmas signing in Hadditon.
I know he's always ungrateful, but I think it's so important to keep these little bookshops open, don't you?
come in soon, my love.
look at that cellulite.
she has been sitting on a bead car seat or what?
her latest tattoo count was nine, including a Sumatran tiger and 'eternity' written in Sanskrit.
she'll be getting a bar code done next, right across there.
and Judy Garland's face right on there.
nice baby, though.
I'd like one that color.
RYAN: Shut the fuck up.
that Ryan's a dick. I think he's cute.
no, you don't. Would you snog him?
maybe. Be like having a slug in your mouth.
RYAN: Shut up, fat arse. It ain't funny.
Ben. Ben?
come on, let's do some messing.
what about you, Glen? Sorry. Where will you be?
in London with a collection of spare academics.
we'll be decking the halls in our own erudite way.
I'll miss our chats.
Yeah. I've been in a state of writerly bliss these past weeks.
I hope I get to come back. Oh. Me too. We'd love to have you.
you know, these are the best mince pies I've ever had.
if it were possible to have an orgasm from food, these mince pies would do it.
she keeps this here for Andy.
what if she's got an alarm? Soon find out.
what if they come back? If you're too chicken, go home.
what the fuck are we doing here? It's kind of research.
I want to write about them. They're funny.
2001 was the best year. I just sold my last three cases.
it's a perfect wine for the price. Besides, I want to show you off.
what am I, arm candy?
more like arm fungus with that face.
I got her this gorgeous Rajasthani Ghagra skirt.
divine.
she'll probably loathe it. Ha-ha.
but if she does, I'll have it. Glen.
GLEN: Hi. Meet Ben. Ben, Glen.
Hi, Ben. Ben's my fiancé.
you're getting married? Uh-huh.
okay. Beautiful dress, magazine photo shoot.
everything the aspiring novelist needs.
I knew you'd be pleased. Have a mince pie? No.
Congratulations.
can we get the fuck out of here? Wait.
in Field of Tares, you made Fred a corporal, but there's no such thing in the Royal Artillery.
they call them bombardiers.
Oh, thank you for that. Very good.
would you make that out for Ben?
to Ben. My fiancé.
we're getting married in the summer.
so I hear.
my heartiest commiserations, Tamara.
merry Christmas, Nichol-arse.
Casey, look.
the sticks.
no, don't touch.
pour Homme.
smells like men.
live the dream, Case. Live the dream, Jode.
his boots.
TAMARA: Look, stop going on about it.
I've invested a lot of time into this house.
why don't you sell it, then? Because I've started writing.
Ben: You can write anywhere.
JODY: Yes, we've done it.
no, Ben, this is proper. It's not just stuff for the paper.
it's about my teens, and it's actually working for me here.
I'm glad it's memory lane for you, but it's doing my fucking head in.
I want some London. Some noise, some urban.
I've had enough. Are you with me or what?
of course, I'm with you.
it's depressing here. It's boring.
and every time I look out the window, I see Andy Cobb's arse.
what's that about?
I remember being really small, too small to see over the edge of a table.
there was a snow globe, and I remember the penguin who lived inside the globe.
he was all alone in there, and I worried for him.
don't worry, kiddo. He has a nice life.
he's trapped in a perfect world.
look at that, Susie Q.
Yeah. - Yeah.
I remember being given a camera for my birthday.
I loved the way a photo could capture a moment before it was gone.
that's what l wanted to be when I grew up, a wildlife photographer.
sorry, Mom!
I imagined that when I was older,
I'd be tracking wild elephants and rhinos, but for now, I'd have to make do with Grace Tarking.
it's strange, the memories you keep.
I remember going with Dad to the sinkhole out at the Connors" farm.
there was something about the way the earth could swallow things whole, and I remember the girl who lived there, Ruth Connors.
the kids at our school said she was weird, but now I know she saw things others didn't.
we're gonna kick it over on three, okay? Are you ready?
all right. One, two, three! - One, two, three!
and I remember the worst thing that ever happened to us as a family.
help! Somebody help!
mom? - Help! - Where are you? Mom? - Buckley, please, get up!
Oh! God. Dad? - Somebody help! Please!
the day my little brother stopped breathing.
Buckley! What happened?
he swallowed a twig!
watch out!
are you crazy?
sorry!
are you okay? You're okay. Oh, my baby. My baby.
and I remember the light in my parents" eyes, the relief.
it was my fault. It will not happen again.
we weren't those people, those unlucky people to whom bad things happen for no reason.
you know! The Buddhists say if you save someone else's life...
grandma Lynn predicted I would live a long and happy life because I had saved my brother.
as usual, Grandma Lynn was wrong.
my name is Salmon, like the fish.
first name, Susie.
I was 14 years old when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.
and up next, we have Crystal in a little, billy, skinny mini!
this was before missing kids started appearing on milk cartons or were feature stories on the daily news.
it was back when people believed things like that didn't happen.
that's right, ladies. No matter what the size, it will hug your girly-girI curves in all the right places.
if you got it, why not flaunt it? - Slow down, buddy!
am I right? - Buckley!
dad, look, look, look!
there it is! Wow.
who is he? Does he like you as much as you like him?
grandma, he's a senior!
he doesn't know I exist.
he's cute.
grandma, can we please just drop it?
you're safe now. He's gone into the record store.
I wasn't safe.
a man in my neighborhood was watching me.
if I hadn't been so distracted,
I would have realized something was wrong, cause that sort of thing gives me the skeevies.
but I was too busy thinking about the length of Ray Singb's eyelashes.
I had counted each one in Iibrary time while he was reading Abelard and Helcise,
the most seriously tragic love story ever.
so, have you kissed him yet?
why not? You like him! He likes you. What's the hold-up?
I'm just afraid I won't be any good at it.
my first kiss was with a grown man.
you're not gonna tell on me, are you? - Of course not!
what was it like? - The kiss?
Oh! It was wonderful. Beautiful. Glorious.
it took me a long time before I realized that a kiss like that, it only happens once.
just have fun, kid.
it wasn't Mr. O" Dwyer, by the way.
although, he does look kind of suspicious.
but Mr. O" Dwyer never hurt anyone.
Mr. O" Dwyer's own daughter died a year and a half after l did.
she had leukemia, but I never saw her in my heaven.
Hey, look at me! - We'll be right there, honey.
one second, okay? - Mom.
Hi, honey.
my murderer was a man from our neighborhood.
thank you so much. - Careful, honey.
I took his photo once as he talked to my parents about his border flowers.
Hey, Mom! - You really should have a cup of coffee with us sometime.
I was aiming for the bushes when he got in the way。
thanks for the flower.
he stepped out of nowhere and ruined the shot.
he ruined a lot of things.
what have you been photographing, honey?
everything. - Everything?
Hey, look at me!
mom!
smile!
mom!
over here!
Hey, look at me!
Hey, Mom!
Hey, over here! Look.
okay, here we go.
clarissa has got a crush on you.
which one's Clarissa?
you know! Blond hair, mega blue eye shadow.
her dad owns Suit n Turf.
the tall one?
she's not tall. She wears platforms.
she doesn't know you're an accountant.
I take it that's a negative.
or that you're a closet scale modeler.
did Mom know before she married you?
about your obsession?
Susie, hobbies are healthy. They teach you things.
like what?
like if you start something, you finish it.
you don't stop until you get it right.
and if you don't get it right, you start over again and you keep on going as long as you have to.
that's the way it is. That's what you do. It's perfectly normal.
you know, Grampy taught me to do this, and now I'm teaching you.
we're creating something here, for us, something special.
I know.
you're my first mate, Susie Q.
one day, all of this will be yours.
Jack, Susie! Dinner!
wait, wait, wait!
ready?
Yeah. - Now, hold her steady.
okay, shipmate, take it away!
now that is a thing of beauty.
come on.
I don't believe this! Would you look at the state of this room?
you're gonna clean this mess up tonight.
Yeah, I will. Hey! Mom, we need to get these developed.
Susie, you used up all the film?
do you have any idea what this is going to cost?
no. No, absolutely not. Out of the question.
thanks a lot. That's my career down the toilet.
do not be so melodramatic. - Honey, what? What's down the toilet?
she's used up all the film we gave her for her birthday.
all of it? - All of it. Every single one.
Susie. - It's a crime to be creative in this family.
all right, all right. Well, say we pay for one roll a month?
one roll a month?
you realize by the time I see my photos, I'm gonna be middle-aged.
look, we got her 24 rolls of film, right?
at $2.99 a piece to develop, that's $71.76.
I don't think we're being unfair. - Oh, honey.
are we?
that's why I love you.
please.
could you just not do that at breakfast?
Yes, okay, whatever you say.
eat your food. Come on.
it doesn't have a siren, you moron. It's a cement mixer.
please don't call your brother a moron.
buddy. No, no, buddy. Cement stays in the bowl. Please.
it's not cement. It's my oaties!
okay. - School. Let's go.
Bye, Dad! - Bye, Susie!
what's that?
that's your new hat, sweetie.
wow, Mom, I thought you'd given up knitting.
no, I'm still knitting. You want me to make you one, too?
do you have your gloves with you? - Yes.
could you put them off, please, young lady?
Susie! Susie! Put your hat on. It's cold.
holiday, inside! Holiday, come here. Come here, boy.
CooI-a-roonie, Suze!
shut up. - No, really, it looks good on you.
this is an exercise in humiliation.
is she looking? - Maybe.
Yes, l am.
Hey, come on. We're late.
next week, bring your homework!
Othello. What is that? It sounds like a mint.
that guy looked pretty stupid with black makeup on.
who? - The one with two first names.
lawrence Oliver. - What a loser!
l know. - Clarissa.
come on. Let's go. - I'm talking to Susie.
Yeah, and I've been waiting for hours for your jerk-off film club to finish.
I want to get out of this dump.
it's nice to see you, too, Brian.
you coming or not?
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll see you, Susie.
I heard there was...
Hey! Susie.
Hi! Ray.
what did you think of The Moor?
who?
Othello.
well... Well, I just...
it was amazing!
Yeah. I mean, it was really incredible!
I love that play.
that's another thing we have in common.
what else do we have in common?
don't you know?
crap!
it's okay. - It's fine. I've got it.
stupid books. I don't even read them. I...
well, I do... - Susie?
what are you doing on Saturday?
are you really from England?
Yes.
you are beautiful, Susie Salmon.
forget it. - This is obscene!
are you listening to me?
there are no breasts on this anatomy model.
there are no eyes or mouth either, but we were told to draw in the face.
well, your unnecessary anatomical additions got the Ellis boy thoroughly overexcited.
he stole my drawing.
Yes, and now there are pictures of naked women all over this school.
move along, people.
sir, can I have my drawing back? - Certainly not.
did you hear me, Singb? Go!
meet me at the mall, 10: 00, Saturday.
now!
where in the mall? - The gazebo.
it's for an Air Force base?
Hello? - Dad.
Hey, buddy. No, no, no!
God, you're choking me. I need some air!
how was your day? - Good. Buckley, go wash your hands.
go ahead, buddy. We'll play after dinner.
is Susie with you?
no. - She's late.
Lindsey Lou, where's your sister? - What?
your sister. - Oh. She had film club.
what's for dinner, hon?
Oh, shoot!
I hope that was your homework.
Oh, hey, you're the Salmon girl, right?
Yeah.
remember me? You remember me.
I live right down the street, down in the green house.
Mr. Harvey.
Hi. - Hi. How are you?
how are your folks doing? - They're fine.
good. TeIl them I said hi.
you know, you're the perfect person for me to run into, because I just built this thing over here and I want to get a second opinion.
do you mind taking a look?
well, actually, Mr. Harvey, I have to get home.
okay.
I just worked so hard on it and I guess I got excited for someone to see it.
but that's okay.
I'll show the other kids in the neighborhood.
they're gonna be very excited about it.
Really?
Oh, yeah. It's great. I mean, lt's really neat.
come on. It'll take two minutes.
you're probably late already.
I don't see anything.
you don't?
you're gonna have to be more observant, Susie.
what is it?
I washed my hands! - Give me five.
Hey, hey, hey, you gotta dry them. AIl right.
Thanks, Mom. - I'm missing a fork.
Oh, not beans! - What?
only one. - One bean?
pretty neat! huh?
you want a... You want a pork chop, honey?
Yes. Thank you. - Hot, hot.
see? Look at your sister, great eating habits.
Yeah, but she's older!
there you go. - Got it?
okay.
I built it for the kids in the neighborhood.
I thought they could use it as kind of a clubhouse, or...
I don't know.
you want to be the first one to try it out?
Really? - Yeah, sure, yeah! Go ahead.
it'll be fun. Go ahead.
the corn got into my beans.
if you eat them both, you can stay up and watch TV with me.
Nah.
I'll make her a plate.
that's it. That's it.
Wow!
wow, this is neato.
she doesn't like beans, so I'm not gonna give her any.
put more. Put more on her plate. I'm gonna make her eat them all.
why doesn't she get to eat beans? - Okay, okay, I'm gonna give her beans.
they're really good. - Watch this.
that's better. - Pile them on.
you think Popeye only eats spinach? There's beans in that can, too.
make yourself at home.
this is really cool, Mr. Harvey. - Yeah, this is cool, hub?
Yeah. I thought that you kids would like a place of your own to! You know, hang out.
here. Have a seat. Go ahead. There you go.
sit. You like it?
Yeah. - Yeah?
you think she's still at the mall?
Yeah. - Really?
she'll be with Clarissa.
she could have at least called.
I mean, a 14-year-old girl knows how to use a telephone.
can I please...
I understand. I understand. I'll deal with her when she gets home.
see, I got all these little things, like this little.
little, you know, fluffy animals and some games, 'cause I know you kids like to play games.
and then, you know! Candles and, you know, little figurines like these angels,
I thought were so pretty.
all the figurines have little...
very sweet. And, you know, some of these little things.
there you go!
it's nice, with the candles and everything, right?
and there's one rule.
no adults allowed!
okay?
that's a cute hat. I like that hat very much.
would you like a refreshment, Susie?
actually, I have to go. - No. Be polite.
you have to be polite.
be polite. That's another rule.
it's warm in here.
I'm warm. Are you warm?
you can take your coat off if you want.
you look very pretty, Susie.
Thanks.
do you have a boyfriend?
no? I knew it. See, I knew you weren't like those other girls.
I knew that.
Mr. Harvey?
it's nice down here, isn't it? It's special. It's special down here, right?
Yes. It is. It's very special.
I have to go.
I don't want you to leave.
I'm not going to hurt you, Susie.
if you see her, would you please just call? Thank you.
she's not with the Steads.
where are my keys?
where are they? - I don't know, honey.
in the bowl by the door? Where are you going?
Jack, could you just wait?
Jack, would you please wait for the police?
look, stay by the phone.
man, she is going to be in so much trouble.
go back to bed, sweetie. - Okay.
guys, this is my little girl, Susie.
she hasn't come home from school. Have you seen her?
no, I ain't seen nobody. - No?
sorry. - Ma'am, could you take a look at this?
have you seen this little girl?
sorry, buddy.
can you take a look at this, please? It's my little girl. She hasn" t come home.
sorry. Just take a look at that.
ma'am, have you seen this girl? Please, can you just take a look?
Susan has been missing for, what is it, four hours now?
Susie. We call her Susie.
Yeah, a little more than four hours.
this the first time she's run away?
she didn't run away. She's...She's missing.
any problems at home?
family difficulties?
no, there really are no problems.
this is a happy... She is a happy child.
she's never done this! Detective. She... - I understand that.
I just have to get a sense of. - She's not home!
and she always comes home. - What's going on here?
there's nothing going on.
she's missing. - Understood.
if you see her, please call me, okay? - Sure thing, Jack.
I'll come back and see you guys in a little while.
all right. Take care.
dad?
excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt you.
my name's Jack Salmon. I live right around the corner.
dad!
dad!
can you put together a list of all her friends - And their names! Contact information... - Sure.
and a description of what she was wearing?
Yes, of course. Well, actually, I could tell you that right now if you want to write it down. She was wearing a hand-knitted wool hat.
mom, Dad!
and it has long, thin tassels.
and she also has...
well, in fact, today she didn't wear her scarf.
but she did wear pink gloves, and she has a beige canvas schoolbag, and it's got...
mom?
rock star buttons pinned to it.
she has Othello inside her bag...
No!
No!
secure that cordon.
Jesus Christ. And tape off the rest of the area before the whole neighborhood shows up.
set up the ICP at the school.
what is that?
we found some evidence in the cornfield behind the school.
there was a cavity in the earth with a lot of debris, mostly loose woods and broken crates.
we think it's the remains of some kind of structure.
and Susie?
we didn't find her, Mrs. Salmon.
that's good, isn't it?
I mean, you found Susie's hat, but you didn't find her, which means we really don't even know if she was there at all. Right?
I mean, that... that... I mean! It's... It's preferable, right?
we also found blood.
a significant amount of blood.
I'm very sorry.
Hey, we'll get through this.
how? - I'm going to take care of you.
how? - I'm going to take care of all of us.
you can't. - l'll make it right.
you can't make this right, Jack.
you can't. - We're going to find her. I promise.
we'll bring her home.
if you see anything that's out of the ordinary or anybody that's out of the ordinary, please don't hesitate to call us.
certainly. - You have my number.
or you just come by the police station. Okay? I'Il be there.
thank you for your time. - You're welcome.
have a good day. - You, too.
what's that, a Wagoneer?
Mr. Harvey. - Yes?
detective Len Fenerman.
how do you do?
do you have some time for a few questions?
certainly. Come in. - Thanks.
I know why you're here, of course.
I think when something like this happens, you always blame yourself.
all I can think about now is why didn't I see something or why didn't I hear something?
because... Because surely that young girl must have screamed.
did you want... - No, no, thanks. I'm right.
but if you could just think back.
I mean, she was wearing a blue jacket, yellow corduroys.
similar clothes to these.
this blue jacket here? - The darker blue jacket.
and on the second photograph, you could see the pants, as well.
Oh, I see. Yeah.
no, it does not ring a bell.
but you were at home that day.
what day? - Last Wednesday.
last Wednesday...
last Wednesday... No, I was home all day.
I mean, I probably went cut and ran a few errands or something like that, but, I mean...
I should have been here all day, for the most part.
okay. Good.
all right. - Thanks.
you married? - I was, yeah.
but you have kids.
no, I wish. I wish. But no.
you mind if I take a look? - No.
I make everything myself.
Really? - Oh, yeah. All this.
I turn all the banisters myself and make all the shingles and the furniture.
and I used to do cabinet making, but there's not much call for that these days.
maybe I spend too much time on these things, but it's the perfectionist in me, I guess.
well it shows. - Thank you.
that's amazing craftsmanship. - Oh, well...
I took a risk and tried something new and discovered a talent that I didn't know I had.
what's that underneath the stairs?
that would be the basement.
dad?
she's dead, isn't she?
I was slipping away.
that's what it felt like.
life was leaving me.
but I wasn't afraid.
then I remembered, there was something I was meant to do, somewhere I was meant to be.
ray Wait!
"if I had but an hour of love ," "if that be all is given me," "An hour of love upon this earth."
"I would give my love to the" "The Moor"
are you "the Moor"?
Why?
I think this belongs to you.
where did you get this?
I found it.
I write poetry. You're quite good.
don't you have somewhere to go?
you miss her, don't you?
I never knew what dead meant.
I used to think it meant lost. Frozen.
it means gone.
she's gone.
what if she isn't?
what if she's still here?
you're not supposed to do that. - What?
who are you? - She saw you, that girl.
I think my hand touched hers.
Yes, that's all it takes.
she carries you now for the rest of her life.
you're not supposed to look back. You're supposed to keep going.
Hey, come back!
wait! Who are you?
I'm Holly. Holly Golightly.
that doesn't sound like a real name. - It isn't.
I borrowed it. You can do that up here.
up here? You mean in heaven.
you're funny. - What's funny about it?
this isn't heaven. You're not there yet.
what is this place?
this place is not really one place and also is not the other place.
it's bits of both!
what is that? - That's where we're going.
Holly said there was a wide, wide heaven beyond everything we knew, where there was no cornfield, no memory, no grave.
but I wasn't looking beyond yet.
I was still looking back.
you can't go back.
who are you?
it's over. Come with me.
I don't know you.
why are you here?
you need to let go of Earth.
you're dead, Susie. You have to leave.
I have to go home.
dad!
my murderer began to feel safe.
he knew people wanted to move on.
they needed to forget.
he took comfort in the thought.
no one was looking at him.
but there was one thing my murderer didn't understand.
he didn't understand how much a father could love his child.
dad!
it's okay.
it's going to be okay.
he knows I'm here. My dad knows I'm here.
I was still with him.
I wasn't lost or frozen or gone.
I was alive.
I was alive in my own perfect world.
dad?
I saw Susie.
she came into my room.
she kissed me on the cheek.
come here! buddy.
I saw her! too.
dad? - Yeah?
I think she listens.
she's used up all the film we gave her for her birthday, all of it?
it's a crime to be creative in this family.
say we pay for one roll a month?
one roll a month?
I got them.
look at these. Some of these are good.
honey, why don't you get them all developed?
this one roll a month thing is... This must be one of her artistic shots.
really crazy, honey. It's crazy. - Why?
I mean! why do we wanna keep this thing dragging out like this?
we're not dragging it out. We made a deal.
there is no deal! Jack.
Fenerman... - Len, I had to call you.
look, Susie is a smart kid. She would never go off with a stranger.
it had to be someone she knew, somebody local.
I'd play with it all the time.
look, I've got a name for you, I've got several names, actually - Ronald Driver. - Do you have an address?
Len, I've got another name for you. He's a janitor. Michael Gitchell.
there's something wrong with this one, I'm telling you. Gary Davis.
who's that? - Davis.
he works in the sanitation department.
okay, I'll look into it, Jack.
I'll look into it. - But I have his address right here.
is it a bad thing if I just drop by there and take a look myself?
Fenerman. - Have you checked on - Frank Peretti yet? - Who?
I have his credit report. Len. It does not look good.
I'm on top of it. You understand?
Len, I found another one. - Jack, listen, you got to trust me, okay?
we're gonna get this guy.
Len! Glad you're here. I was just going to call you.
Yeah. I got your messages.
I've been at the Public Records Office all day.
got a lot o stuff to go over here.
I know you're looking at the obvious suspects, convicted felons, child molesters. And I understand why, but, Len, I think you're coming at it from the wrong angle.
honey... - Herman Stolfuz just across the Street.
now, he appears to be perfectly normal, but, Len, -the man wears adult diapers. - Herman is 80 years old.
I followed him in the supermarket. His shopping cart was filled with them.
he has a prostate problem. - My point is
we need to start working backwards.
start looking at family histories, criminal records, mental health issues.
I've been doing a lot of reading on this subject.
Jack, this doesn't change anything.
did I mention taxes? Len, you can tell a lot about a person from taxes.
please, will you just stop it now? Will you just stop?
can't you just leave it alone?
Jack, I know it's been 11 months.
I know you've been trying to deal with this in your own way, but she's not coping very well. She needs help, Jack.
she needs someone to help her get through this.
grandma's here! Grardma! Grandma's here!
what's my mother doing here?
look, you're not coping, okay?
Len's worried. I'm worried. Your mother offered to help.
you invited her here?
darling! - Hello, Mother - Watch the hair, sweetheart. - Sorry.
look at you. Are you eating? - Is this all of it?
don't be ridiculous. That's just my makeup.
you are still handsome as hell, Jack.
Lindsey, honey, aren't you going to say hello?
the child hates me. - Come here, buddy.
so, what'll it be, Jack?
actually, I'm not drinking these days.
well, that's your problem in a nutshell.
are we still a family?
of course we're a family.
your mother's in crisis, your father's a wreck.
what does that make you?
I'm in charge.
through the woods, looking for fuzzwalker.
then he sees three. And he takes his gun and looks and aims.
and then, a giant puff of smoke!
he doesn't see them anymore. Then he realizes that was his gun.
it was out of bullet. Then he runs.
runs. runs. runs, runs, runs!
till he runs in the forest, but then he realizes he came without his fuzzwalker.
all right! Okay!
you're a Salmon girl, right?
okay.
okay.
grandma?
I know where Susie is.
Yeah, Susie's gone to heaven, sweetheart.
Lindsey said there is no heaven.
all right, then, she's dead.
you might be dead soon.
why do you say that? - Because you're old.
thirty-five is not old.
you've been sniffing too much of that nail polish.
and, anyway, nothing is going to happen to me.
you know why?
because I take my medicine every day.
grandma, she's here.
what? - Susie.
Susie's in the in-between.
I was in the blue horizon, between heaven and Earth.
the days were unchanging, and every night, I dreamed the same dream.
the smell of damp earth.
the scream that no one heard.
the sound of my heart beating, like a hammer against cloth.
and I would hear them calling, the voices of the dead.
I wanted to follow them, to find a way out, but I would always come back to the same door.
and I was afraid.
hey there, all you sleepy Angelenos. A good, good morning to you.
it's your buddy, Romeo Midnight. I know.
I'm the voice you normally listen to in the middle of the night.
but today is special, Los Angeles.
it's my favorite day of the year.
today is Valentine's Day.
and that's why I'll be here all day and all night, playing the songs you love...
...and the songs you love to love to.
Hi.
okay.
when I was a kid, most of the advice that my dad gave me was crap.
there's one thing that he said that was pure genius.
he said, "If you ever are with a girl...
...that's too good for you...
...marry her.
so...
Really? Happy Valentine's Day.
happy Valentine's Day.
she said yes!
Julia, call me as soon as you get this.
I got big news. Big news.
she said yes. You're kidding.
what? I mean, you're kidding!
you thought she'd say no.
man, come on. You know me...
...always preparing for the worst. Immigrant mentality.
forget it. She said yes. This is good news. Yeah, and get this:
I don't even have to play it cool today.
I can be a sappy cheeseball all day...
...mooning about love to total strangers, and no one'll think I'm a moron.
because it's Valentine's Day, huh?
and everyone is romantic on Valentine's Day.
get your head out of your ass and use your damn turn signal...
...you freaking moron.
good morning, Los Angeles.
I'm Sherry Donaldson with the KVLA news team.
and now let's check the weather. Good morning.
sun shines on late morning, and look at these numbers.
highs in the upper valleys in the 60s, and a bit cloudy by the coast...
...until mid-morning, when the marine layer burns off.
Susan, what the hell is this?
Oh, the boss thinks it's gonna up the ratings.
and we're clear.
not talking about Pippi Longstocking,
I'm talking about this.
I'm a sports journalist, I don't do lifestyle.
you're my number two sports journalist, Kelvin, which means...
...that on slow sports days, you do the pieces I want you to do.
the station wants more fluff.
look I'll do some follow-up stories, do some investigative reporting...
...bring it back to you?
there's only one story today, Kelvin. It's all yours.
it's not complicated. It's your basic man on the street.
tell me, John Q, Jane Q, what does Valentine's Day mean to you?
it gives me acid reflux. That's what it means to me.
I mean, we spend a lot of money. Nobody cares.
it's not a real holiday.
we don't take the day off. Come on, Susan.
and we're coming back in five, four, three...
listen, I'm a player...
...but I shut down my player-ness...
...from New Year's to Saint Paddy's Day just so I can avoid this day.
I need happy, I need romantic, I need love...
...and I need it from you.
you need Jesus.
go. Go away now.
Sunflowers! Beautiful!
good morning!
Hello, good morning. Hello, hello.
I need my lucky bamboo. Actually, I need both flats, and...
do you hav...? I actually need the whole lot. All of them?
want my Gerbera daisies too?
no, no, no. No... Yes.
Alphonso's gonna pick everything up later.
Mr. Reed, why are you always happy?
why not be always happy?
I gotta go.
Reed? Simon.
reed. What's up, man?
how are you? All right.
what's going on? Hey, I'm gonna be on TV.
interviewer over there. Really?
nice! Listen, I need to talk to you.
morley said yes.
she said yes?
what is with everybody? She said yes. I'm getting married.
it's great news, huh?
listen, I need to get her something, like, really nice, though, like...
not roses, something out of the ordinary, you know?
wow, what is it? No, no, no.
do not open until perfect moment.
ready for the interview.
Kelvin Moore here, KVLA Channel 13...
...right here at the downtown flower mart with Mr. Simon Pham...
...that's P-H-A-M, not with an F.
Mr. Pham, how many red roses do you sell on Valentine's Day?
the Captain and Tennille were married on Valentine's Day.
what's that you said?
the Captain and Tennille were married on Valentine's Day.
a hundred and ten million red roses are sold in America every Valentine's Day.
sixty percent are produced in California.
does he work for you? I mean...
I'm a florist.
I own Siena Bouquet, 2173 Rosewood.
and what's your name, sir? Reed Bennett.
Hi. How are you? Sports guy. Sports.
reed Bennett. Yeah, sports.
okay, from Santa Montica... Siena Bouquet.
Santa... What is it? Siena Bouquet.
Siena Bouquet.
in the Val... Off of Ventura.
well, you do have a flaw after all.
Oh, yeah? What's that? Your job.
I thought women liked doctors.
we do like lab coats, but the flying around everywhere is not so good.
I'm only going to San Francisco for one night.
couldn't somebody else do it, just tonight?
no, I'm the best.
if it's any consolation, when I'm fixing his heart...
...you can hold mine.
Oh. Thank you.
Hey, what are you doing? No. I can't miss my plane. No.
I can't believe you're leaving me on Valentine's Day.
you said you had something to do. I do have something to do.
I do have something to do. I just don't know that I wanna do it.
you know my friend Kara? Which one's Kara?
neurotic, hot mess.
she throws this annual "I Hate Valentine's Day" dinner.
it's a bit of a downer, actually. What's there to hate?
nothing, if you're a handsome, divorced doctor.
but for the rest of us single women, it's kind of a giant cosmic bitch slap.
it's the universe saying, "Look, remember when you were 14...
...and you had cystic acne and braces...
...and you played the saxophone in the band...
...and no one would invite you to the winter formal?
well, nothing's changed.
I would crawl over cut glass to take you to the winter formal.
and then I would prescribe Retin-A for your skin.
that's why you're my valentine.
so we have a professional here.
I'm sure you've heard a lot of stories on Valentine's Day.
do you still believe in love?
hell, yes. Love is the only shocking act left on the planet.
well, if he said it, folks, it must be true, because he is a florist.
what is it?
Oh, you're up.
did you get my good side?
I don't know. Roll over.
last night...
was...?
amazing. Okay, thank you.
Wow. Well, I used to be a gymnast.
Oh, well, that explains a lot.
Yeah, I didn't hurt you, right?
you're so cute. I thought you wanted to be a poet...
...not a photographer.
a girl can change her mind, Jason.
that's how last night happened.
anyway, I could not write that photo.
okay, yeah. Um...
is my nose kind of...? It looks kind of big for my face.
I think that's L. A. Talking. I think you have a great nose.
Oh, my God. Is that the time?
what? What? No, it's 3 minutes fast. I don't like being late.
I have to go. I just... Just like that?
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just... Skirt? Skirt, skirt, skirt.
what? Oh, right. I think I half-remember that.
three minutes? Why not 5 minutes ahead?
I don't wanna seem eager.
but, yeah, you know what? Stay.
hang out for a little bit. Maybe we can grab breakfast.
Oh, I knew it. I knew it. What is that, techno?
what? The ring.
Oh, no, I think it's, like, a little more retro. It's kind of '70s.
thank you so much for last night. I had a blast.
and there is fresh coffee for you in the kitchen.
I think I'm out of coffee. You were.
I borrowed some from your neighbor. She was very surprised...
...you had female company, thought that you were gay.
don't worry, I set her straight.
Bye.
Hi.
Oh, I was thinking about you all night long.
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't answer on the first ring.
it's not my fault.
I was thinking about what you were gonna do to me...
...and I just couldn't wait. I didn't have a free hand.
Oh, baby. You know just how Katia likes it. Mm.
well, it's Valentine's Day, sugar.
how about something special?
my roommate just got home. Do you wanna have a threesome?
if he says yes, it'll take me a minute to change.
Ooh. I think that's a very good idea.
Edgar, we said we were not gonna give each other presents this year.
I know, I lied.
so did I. Wow.
today's the day I make most of my dough.
I deliver love-grams to businesses.
I even delivered a breakup-gram today.
folks, from the chubby messenger of love himself...
...that Valentine's Day is about love.
it's about romance. It's about commercialism that...
found the glue, Grandma. Well, good.
this is really a hard day for him...
...because they used to make handcrafted cards together.
well, maybe we should've offered to do that with him.
I did.
but he said it was only fun when it was with his mother.
so, Edison...
...what are we doing for breakfast today? I can't eat, Grandpa.
who said that? So you can't eat?
what's the matter? What's the matter, you sick?
Yeah. Lovesick.
Julia, it's Reed. I've been trying to reach you.
call me back, please.
Oh, boy. Oh.
Hi. Hi.
so my boyfriend texted me this morning.
and he was like, "Look outside your door.
Oh.
and... But, you know, I look outside my door...
...and my boyfriend's nowhere to be found.
right.
but there's this giant white bear. Yeah, the bear.
on the ground. The floor. I get it.
Yeah. Isn't that the sweetest thing ever? Ever and ever.
do you live here? In this building?
because I see you in the lobby all the time.
because I live here. No, I just visit. Just visiting.
all right, well, I'm gonna go to school now.
gonna take my bear with me.
I hope you get a lot of valentines today. Thanks.
Hello, everyone. This is your captain speaking.
on behalf of myself and the flight deck...
...we wanted to wish everyone a happy Valentine's Day.
hope you had an opportunity to get a little rest.
but according to my digital readout here, we've still got another six hours...
...before we reach our final destination of Los Angeles...
...where the weather is expected to be warm and sunny after three days of rain.
Oh, hello. Hey.
Hey, is Reed here, or is he on a run?
Yeah, he's in there.
okay. Hey, guys. Hi, Julia.
how was last night, brutal? Yeah.
have you been up all night? Hey.
wow, everybody's here today. Oh, whose child is this? Hello?
Oh, there's your mother. Please hold.
Hey, Nikki. Good morning.
Oh, these are yellow. Where's Reed?
your pal's in the cafe the pastries were late.
Oh, yeah. I think he might be having a rough morning.
Hello, Siena Bouquet.
Hey. Reed. Just need...
we need the morning glories. Oh, there they are. Perfect. Great.
Hey, I got your message. You okay? Yeah.
what happened? Well, you just sounded like...
you sounded like maybe she said...
Yes.
she said yes. No.
why doesn't anybody have confidence?
she said yes? Yes.
Oh, my goodness. Okay. I didn't...
I didn't get it, but congratulations!
call me Mr. Engaged. You're getting married.
Hi, I ordered some tulips.
Yes. You can't put the baby on the counter, it's dangerous.
but I can't get my money out.
she should be off the counter. Thanks.
here, let me hold her. Thank you.
you should know we're Jewish. God loves us all.
thank you. Hello, Siena Bouquet.
he's the first decent guy I've dated in a long time.
it's going that well, huh?
I am so sick of dating. I'm so jealous of you guys.
when do I get to meet the phantom physician?
I think soon. You guys got plans tonight?
nothing. He has to go to San Francisco, so we're gonna talk on the phone.
you know what you should do?
you should fly up and surprise him.
you think so? Yeah. Why not?
no. Come on.
I don't know where he's staying...
you make a call, you find out. What's the big deal?
God, you really think I should go? Why not?
come on, it's Valentine's Day. You don't think. You just do.
go.
get out of here. Congratulations.
hello there. Hi.
Hey, honey. I'm just pulling into the airport.
I'll call you when I land, okay?
okay, I get it. Okay, have a safe flight. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Thanks. Bye-bye.
hello. Good morning. I'm home.
Hi, Daddy. Hey, peanut.
Hi, sweetie.
did you fix all the broken hearts? I did.
I did. Happy Valentine's Day.
happy Valentine's Day to you.
surgery went late. I stayed at the condo. I figured.
doesn't Daddy juggle well?
Yeah. Mm-hm.
what are you doing?
sorry, I... Excuse me, I was trying to close the window.
I'm sorry.
no. For leaning on my shoulder? Come on, it's the least I could do. A 14-hour flight.
Oh, God, that's better.
you on active duty? Yes, sir.
two bars. Is that lieutenant? Two bars is the captain.
you have a loved one in L. A?
well, I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.
how long...? How long has it been since you've been home?
eleven months.
and how long do you get to stay?
just till tomorrow.
Wow. Fourteen-hour flight both ways just for one night.
wow, that's romantic.
you're a romantic. I mean, that's quite a gesture.
that's commitment.
you on Facebook?
I need some chrysanthemums. What? You should speak English.
I had to learn when I came. Chrysanthemums and calla lilies.
I don't know what it... Michael, calm down.
what language do you speak in?
I used to speak Bulgarian, but I'm an American citizen now.
does anybody here speak English with a Bulgarian accent?
over here. I do. There he is.
Bulgarize away. Here we go.
there she is! The future Mrs. Reed Bennett!
Oh, chrysanthemums.
Hi, babe. Hi, baby.
Hello, fiance.
it sounds weird. Have you said it yet? Nikki, take over for a minute.
come this way.
wait, these are for you. I knew they were for somebody.
Sarah, have you met my fiance? Hi, Morley.
Hi. I just like saying it. I feel so grown-up.
next, please!
look what you forgot. See, that is...
is one empty hand.
Oh, yeah.
don't be mad.
mad? Why would I be mad? I'm concerned.
well, just...
do you have any idea what it would be like at work today if I wore that thing?
I mean, people will be asking me...
Where'd you get the big ring?
you know, "How many bridesmaids?" And, "How did he do it?
gonna have kids? How many?" Three.
what? Two dogs, and maybe some chickens.
we can talk about it. We don't have to.
sweetheart, I just think right now...
...it would be better if maybe we could just keep it a secret.
where are you from? I am from Ruse.
all right, you guys can start a Bulgarian village together. All right.
Oh, my God, look, there's the bride. Hi.
listen, I called my BFF, Tony.
he is already on the dress.
he does all the gowns in Vegas.
Cher, Celine, Carrot Top.
this is going to be so much fun! Oh, my God, it's...
breathe, breathe. I have to breathe.
okay.
see what I mean? Yep, I get it.
so...
...Iove is the problem?
did you ever have it? Oh, yeah.
how old were you when you got it?
let's see. I'd just started working at an architectural firm...
...and there was this beautiful young girl, and she was studying to be an actress.
was your heart kind of going:
Yeah. Yeah, just that way. It went, bumpada, bumpada, bumpada, boom.
you betcha. Just like that.
one day I got up the courage to introduce myself.
I walk out, walked right up to her and opened my mouth and...
...nothing comes out. Nothing?
nothing. Not a peep.
but she's just waiting for me to say something, I'm like a statue.
so finally she says, "All right, I'll meet you here at 6: 30.
she knew what you were going to say.
Yep. Yeah. She's been reading my mind like that for 51 years.
the pretty girl was Grandma, right?
the pretty girl is Grandma, right?
when are we gonna get there, Grandpa? Coming up to Moorpark.
making a left turn right here. What's Moorpark spelled backwards?
I don't know. "Kraproom.
grandpa. And don't say that in school.
Hello, Siena Bouquet.
I'll come with you on runs. You got it.
but we gotta hustle. They're flying in now.
I'm always hustling, baby.
no, no, no. Like, "hustle" hustle. Like, no, don't dilly-dally, okay?
let me tell you, I don't dilly-dally.
crazy businessman.
this guy, like, he wants to give family discounts to his 30 cousins.
what is this? What have you got going...?
excuse me. Can I help you?
I'd like to send a dozen of those to the best girl at my school.
and this musical card. A dozen of those with thi...?
this... It's...
okay.
all right, where am I sending these to?
falcon Crest Elementary.
you can MapQuest it.
I actually know where it's at. I got a friend that goes there.
cool. During recess would be the best time.
when you get there, just hand me the flowers, and I'll do the rest.
okay? I'll be there.Thank you, sir.
what's up with the cutest kid in the world coming in here?
and he shorted me.
he just gave me, like, 15 bucks for a $55 arrangement.
could I please have my receipt?
what, did you get audited last year?
I did.
they always get the good guys, I'm telling you. Here.
Thanks.
so, like, last night, amazing.
this morning, she couldn't get away fast enough.
any chance there was a little, shall we say, disappointment on her part?
no. What? No. None.
at all.
well... No, no, no. It was fine. Fine's not good enough, dude.
it was better than fine. It was a solid A.
minus. B plus, A minus. A minus.
I hate Valentine's Day.
why can't these guys deliver their flowers to their girlfriends themselves?
wait, what? They just dump them in the mailroom.
I mean, if they don't wanna take the time to...
it's Valentine's Day today? Hello?
happy Valentine's Day.
Wha...? No, it's a Monday. Valentine's Day always falls on a Thursday.
that's Thanksgiving, Hoosier-head.
Really?
you're 25. You thought that for 25 years?
dude, he's from Indiana.
they only celebrate Love Your Cousin Day.
no, you're thinking of Kentucky.
of course Liz was acting weird this morning.
you do have something planned for tonight, right?
how could I have something planned for tonight?
I didn't even know until right now.
I can do my lunch break, and I can do after 5?
okay, great.
no, no, no. I don't mind people with fetishes.
no, no, no, very creative people. I gotta put you on hold, sorry.
good morning.
you're a strong, confident person.
good morning. Who are you?
I am Liz. I am one of the receptionists. I'm subbing for Monica.
Oh, yeah, Monica, because she wanted today off.
shit, she has a life.
she had a funeral, which is a life, I guess.
well, Liz, I'm Paula.
I know they call me Bipolar Paula.
don't. But you should know I'm in crisis.
okay. I don't wanna talk about it.
okay. It has nothing to do with being alone...
...on Valentine's Day. Of course not.
and everything to do with the client in crisis.
that sounds challenging. "Challenging"?
gotta figure out if he still has an athletic career.
if he doesn't, big fat problem.
well, I'm here to help you solve that problem.
who's on hold?
my mother.
I'm sorry.
hangs up on her own mother.
that's cold.
we might just get along.
Hello, I'm Hannah Storm.
and with football season officially over...
...the only lingering question is: What will Sean Jackson do?
a devastating loss in the championship game last week...
...leaves his future in question.
his contract is up, and at age 35...
...he's one of the oldest quarterbacks in the league.
does his team want him back?
of course I want Sean Jackson back.
but it's not my decision.
if not, will he test the waters of free agency?
or will he make this easier on everyone...
...and just retire?
come on, Hannah. Lighten up.
Hi, neighbor!
Hey, Sean. Hey, girls.
Hey, when are you gonna come over for a swim?
Oh, sorry, sweetie. I got lots going on today.
I'm running out of patience. And I'm running out of willpower.
but right now, I gotta make a call.
no. Uh-oh.
help, Heather!
I'm coming, I'm coming! Yeah, hello?
Kara, it's Sean.
Hi, hi. What's going on? What's going on?
media blitz on my career has begun.
Yes, I know. Are you okay?
of course I'm okay. It comes with the territory.
what I'd love is for my highly paid publicist to take care of it.
I'm on it.
I've got my people standing by and a press release ready to go.
what else? I got a meeting with my agent today.
I want you to meet me there in about an hour. You'll be there?
Hello? Hello? Did I lose you?
Malibu.
you pay a fortune to be here to get crappy cell phone reception.
no, no. I'm here. I'm here. I'll be at the meeting.
outstanding.
drumline, keep your eyes on Scotty.
registration for the AP exam is due next week, so don't flake.
Hey, Grace.
I was thinking of putting together just a little test-prep group for the class...
...and I was hoping I could pick your brain about what to focus on...
...since you've taken the test, and I've... I haven't.
Yeah, yeah. You know, no problem.
Oh, great. How about today after school?
you know, I can't today. I nanny after school.
how about today at lunch?
uh. See, normally that would work for me...
...but today at lunch,
I'm gonna have sex with my boyfriend for the first time.
first time having sex for both of us.
that is quite a special time for you.
it's Valentine's Day, we're in love, we're both 18...
...and I just want it to be special and...
the point is, my parents work, so they'll be gone during lunch.
lunch is the only time it can work out.
you know, I'm free tomorrow lunchtime.
lunchtime tomorrow, I'll definitely be free.
Oh, you'll be done having sex by then?
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. It'll be good. All right.
Bye.
come sign the latte petition. Right here, kids.
Yeah. Right here. Okay.
you're gonna eat first? No.
no? Maybe some Gatorade.
that's... Yeah, I don't wanna get dehydrated.
you're not gonna eat lunch? No. No lunch.
well, did you have a big breakfast? No.
do pushups. I'm telling you, I do them before I run.
what? Pushups make you run faster?
no. Makes you look better.
I'll get you a sandwich when you come back.
Yeah, thanks. That's a good idea. Save the lattes.
they're putting lattes in the vending machines? Finally.
Hey. So I'm gonna go to English...
...and then I'm gonna go set up. I'll see you there.
all right.
thank you, Felicia.
Mr. Schwabbe, I'm so glad you're taking care of this.
you got it. And I like caramel lattes...
...just, like, FYI. Duly noted.
have fun at lunch!
what do you think?
we're gonna wait.
I think we should just, like, enjoy this time.
Yeah. Okay. Good. Did you like your gift?
I didn't open it yet. You need to open it.
it's... It's my track shirt.
Yeah, but I ironed on your lucky number on the back.
thirteen.
but that's your lucky number.
you don't even like it.
no. No, I love it. I can't wait to wear it.
okay.
try it on now, then. Now?
Yeah. Well...
...you know, a little uncomfortable taking my shirt off in public.
but, hey, I'll wear it later, okay? Okay.
are you gonna carry it around all day?
shut up.
let's see if this fits in my locker. Right.
this is his fifth paternity test. What are we talking about?
so I spoke with the GM. They passed.
passed?
we got to the playoffs. I was all-league.
they decided to go another way. They're chasing that kid from Alabama.
I'm working on a press release saying it was a mutual parting.
well, so now what? Well, we... We look for another team.
I don't know. Maybe I'm done.
you're not done. Absolutely not.
and I'm not speaking as someone who makes a lot of money off of you.
I'm speaking as your fan.
right now, you can still make a ton of money doing what you love.
well, the problem is, Paula, it's not the only thing I want out of life.
a relationship. Kids.
well, you can still have that and play football.
look, I'm not complaining. I've been lucky. But...
so, what is he telling me? What are we gonna do?
I think we should take a beat and let Sean think about what he wants.
right? Right.
we have no time for thinking.
put it on their tab.
come on! Ha-ha-ha!
that's seven in a row. It's amazing.
you are like... This woman's a shark.
you are good at this game. Not really.
just witnessed a tactical game of reading your opponent and adjusting accordingly.
wait, are you saying that you're reading me?
thank you.
happy Valentine's Day. Oh, thank you.
Yes, I can read you. It's part of my training.
everyone gives subtle hints.
hints? Like what? Giveaways.
you boarded the plane wearing a suit but no wedding ring.
serious, but not committed.
you let a stranger sleep on your shoulder.
kindness, but also feels good to be needed.
the heart-shaped candy. Another giveaway.
either you have a problem with sugar, which, based on the syrup...
...you put on your pancakes, I wouldn't think so.
or you have a problem with candy in the shape of a heart.
which means you might have a problem with romance...
...and things pertaining to this day in particular.
not bad, soldier.
okay, Edison. Thank you very much.
now you all have seen how to properly place your valentines...
...into our fabulous envelopes, go ahead. Great.
and while you are doing that quietly, a little history about Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day was a massacre in Chicago where they shot everybody...
...and put a curse on the Chicago Cubs.
thank you, Franklin, but this is a different Valentine's Day. Lose the hat.
okay, in ancient Rome...
...Emperor Claudius II, who was also known as Claudius the Cruel.
Claudius the Cruel banned all marriages...
...because he wanted his soldiers to concentrate on war.
but there was a priest who was known as Valentine...
...who secretly married everyone anyway because he believed in love.
Claudius found out about the marriages, and he threw Valentine in jail...
girls. I'm watching you.
thank you.
anyway, on February the 14th,
Valentine wrote a note to his beloved...
...and he signed it: "Farewell, from your Valentine.
let's see. Are there any questions?
Franklin, I can't wait to hear this. Go ahead.
miss Fitzpatrick, are you in love with anyone?
I saw you on TV today.
was it on? Yeah, that's why I'm here.
Yes. We're famous!
yay, we're famous. Yes.
so you're the owner, I take it.
Yeah, tech... Yes. My grandfather actually started it in Italy.
Yeah, my dad brought it over, but now I got the shop.
that's great. It's a family business.
look, I hate to play this card, but I'm a doctor.
I have surgery in an hour and a half.
is there any way you could help me?
say no more. Thank you.
could I get an order form, please, for the great doctor here?
I need two arrangements.
something special, long-stemmed roses for each one of my...
...ladies.
I need your discretion.
we have an understanding, right?
I understand. There's a florist code.
great. Here's the credit card. And here are the addresses.
these are the addresses for the ladies.
Harrison Copeland?
Yes, you need... You want some ID?
Nope. Should be good. Uh...
okay, this Julia Fitzpatrick, that would be your...
...girlfriend.
Yes. And this Pamela Copeland...
...It's the same last name as you. Would that be your wife?
Yes.
I thought we had some sort of code, understanding.
the code is the code.
I just wanna make sure that your understanding...
...is the same understanding as my understanding. Understand?
Yeah, can you run the card, please? Yep.
thank you. I have to get my wallet. I'll be right back.
wish me luck. All us virgins are pulling for you. Whoo!
if you need any help, text me.
Pushkin.
good girl. Go play.
pushkin, no. Downstairs, Pushkin.
Oh, Grace When I saw your face
Oh, Grace
Hey, you. Come on. Mommy's home for a minute.
Wha...? Come on, sweetie.
made my heart race like a high-speed chase
grace Grace?
Oh, my...! Alex!
holy... Mrs. Smart. Oh, my gosh!
what are you doing here?
I'm rehearsing!
naked? Naked! Yes!
it's... It's experiment...
I'm doing an... Ow! Experimental show.
it's very, very avant-garde type of thing.
and the... Oh, shit! I mean, excuse me!
it's okay. I've heard the word before. Not shit!
God, look at the time. I gotta go. Thank you for everything, though.
Ow!
I'm so sorry! It's okay.
are you okay? Please! Do not come closer.
this does not look right, Alex.
thanks for everything and... Oh, my God.
no, Pushkin. Pushkin, no. Pushkin. Pushkin.
that's okay. You know what, I'm gonna just...
all right. Breathe. Oh, my goodness. All right.
see you very soon, Mrs. Smart! Bye-bye.
Mrs. SMART: Alex, honey, cover your hoo-hoo!
grace! Grace! What are you doing? What happened?
mom. What, your mom?
Yeah, sure. My mom was at your house. Wha...?
my mom. What did you say?
that I was rehearsing.
naked? Did she buy it?
I think so. My fear made me very convincing.
I wrote you a song.
if you do that again, Vladimir...
...I will have no choice but to get down off my horse...
...and punish you. Hello? Who wants a valentine?
I am wearing my thigh-high black leather boots...
...carrying my riding crop.
now pull down your pants and bend over.
I think this floor has the most valentines.
what a sweet little pink ass you have.
and I will beat it with my crop...
...until you submit to me, you filthy peasant.
I will beat it, and beat it, and beat it, and beat it.
thank you for calling Naughty Nymphos.
the charge will appear on your credit card as Vague Entertainment.
hi there!
Hi. Well, if it isn't the gymnast.
well... Yes.
to paraphrase some poet:
there's a hell of a nice universe next door.
let's go." E. E. Cummings.
Yeah, E. E. Good stuff. Yeah. Good stuff.
I think you said he was your favorite. Yes.
I did say he was my favorite. He had me at the font.
I feel, like, so stupid for forgetting that it's Valentine's Day today.
Oh, no. It's really not a big deal.
you know what, it is to me.
so can I take you out tonight?
Yes. That would be wonderful. Yes.
how fast does that cart go? Well, let's find out.
Liz...
...there's a man on line 2
asking me to cover him up in Vaseline and bubble wrap.
I'll take care of that. Damn prank callers.
and he doesn't have a Russian accent, so I don't think you'll need your horse.
you heard that? It's my phone line.
Oh, Paula. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
am I fired?
it's cool. You got a way with dirty words, I like that.
just make sure you answer my calls first.
Absolutely. Oh, you do not have to worry about that.
probably not gonna make Employee of the Month.
...America's number one sports talk show.
and, Greeny, the news of the hour: Sean Jackson, now a free agent.
what's he supposed to do?
he can check out Craigslist...
...see who's hiring.
Oh, man. Hey, man, you see this?
you did this. Man, you're gonna pay for this.
easy, big fella. I know it was my fault.
if you just call my business manager, he's got all my information.
and I'll have my business manager call your business manager, okay?
Sean Jackson. Oh, man, my neck. Oh, and my back.
and my chest. I'm just kidding.
whoa, dude, will you sign my hat? Sure.
thirty-five completions, three touchdowns on the ground.
they think you should hang it up. That's gratitude for you.
well, thanks, buddy.
but that door's pretty messed up. You got another truck?
Yeah, but I'm already behind.
Valentine's Day is kind of a big day flower-wise.
I don't know why people get flowers delivered.
you can give them yourself.
some folks like to get flowers at the workshop.
to some people, love doesn't exist unless you acknowledge it in front of other people.
you're a superstar, Sean. Drive better. Whoop!
Yeah, Kara, it's me. Listen, I know what I wanna do.
I think.
Oh, no, man, not today.
so, what do I do?
do I tell her and break her heart, or keep it to myself and stay out of it?
it's none of my business.
you want my opinion?
Yes. No.
well, it depend... What's your opinion?
ask yourself, if the situation was reversed...
...what would you want her to do?
why you gotta be so sensitive?
it's because you're so fragile.
okay, so a neutral chlorine atom has 17 protons and 17 electrons.
and, if these two atoms become...
Hi. This order came into the shop for you.
I thought I'd deliver it myself.
Hey, guys, this is my friend, Reed.
say hi. Hi, Reed.
take a look at chapter 10, section two. Just, quietly, to yourselves.
they're from Harrison. Did he come into the shop? Wow.
did you meet him?
I kind of need to talk to you. Do you have a second?
Yeah, sure.
edison, you're in charge.
recess. Let's party. Sit down, and be quiet. Got that?
I'm just glad you got to see them. They're so cute.
Yeah. They're great. Hey, guess what.
I got a flight. I'm leaving at 5: 30. I'll be there by dinner.
you know what, actually, I don't think it's a good idea.
Why? It was your idea.
well, sometimes I have bad ideas.
it was a genius idea.
Mr. Bouquet, what about my flowers? Is everything okay?
I gave you $13. Oh, right. I remember.
Yeah, they're probably on the truck.
don't worry, man, they'll be here soon.
edison, I've known Mr. Bouquet for a long, long time.
if he tells you your flowers are gonna be here, then they will be here.
just give me 30 seconds. Hold down the fort. I'll be right back.
don't get on the plane.
why not?
you're sweet.
is this because Harrison came into the shop?
and it made you realize that things could change between us.
no, it's not about me.
because up to now, all these years, I've just been there for you.
and with Morley, if she works late...
...if you wanna see a bad movie she doesn't wanna see...
...or if you wanna have junk food that she's not gonna have...
...I'm clearly your go-to girl. And you're the best.
and now, there's this guy in the mix. And he's not just a guy...
...he's a man.
you're afraid he's gonna steal me? No. When he came in...
because, listen, since l...
I'm your buddy. Don't worry. I know.
I'm not going anywhere.
but thanks for coming. I'll call you later.
Hey, what's happening in here? Get back in your seat!
what in the... Stop that.
get back. That is enough.
have you lost your minds? To your seat. That's it, that's it.
I can't talk right now! I'll have to call you later!
break it up. Let's go. Come on.
stop it. Stop looking at me like that. I tried to tell her.
not hard enough, Reed.
you don't know. Oh, I don't know?
no, you've never seen her sad.
she looks like an abandoned puppy dog when she cries.
I'm not gonna do that to her.
especially not today. I'm not gonna ruin Valentine's Day for her.
I know what day it is. We got a van full of flowers.
at least hurry up. We're behind.
you can't rush love.
I'm gonna drop this off in the bedroom before Morley gets home.
I'll be right back.
he's not gonna hurry.
I'm gonna fish.
Hey, how was your day? Go, go.
What...? Go!
no, wait.
I want to get out of here. Okay, breathe. Like I taught you.
all right, now tell me what's wrong.
she doesn't know I love her.
she didn't get her flowers. She doesn't know.
I need to make things right. Will you please help me, Grace? Please?
of course. But first, soccer.
hang on. Okay, I can hear you now.
okay. It's gonna be me all alone at my own party.
nobody R. S.V. P.'s. It's L. A.
everyone wants you to think they have a life.
I hate you being so in love. Oh, I know. Thank you.
speaking of which, I am going to San Francisco.
sorry I won't be there.
whack the heart for me, honey. I gotta go. Bye.
Carmine, relax. It's me.
Hey. Reed.
what are you doing here? Are you okay? Is it...?
I'm sorry.
I love you.
but I'm just not ready for this kind of commitment.
and I didn't know that this morning.
no, it's okay.
I shouldn't have rushed it. We can wait.
you didn't do anything wrong.
I shouldn't have been surprised when you asked.
I should be thinking about our future together.
but I'm still focused on my future.
look, you can still have your career, baby.
we're getting married. We're not becoming monks or something.
and then there's the whole thing with my parents' horrible...
your parents? Wait a second.
just because your parents had a bad divorce...
...does not mean that you're going to have a bad divorce.
they're not hereditary. It's not like it's contagious, all right?
you're not getting it.
you know, the first phone call I made after you proposed was to my office.
to confirm my 10: 00 meeting.
it's really beautiful.
for someone else.
don't worry. It's...
me and Carmine will be fine. Won't we?
won't we, Carmine?
right, baby?
Carmine, come. Come here.
okay, all right. Yeah. Okay...
did you even consider marrying me?
of course I did.
but when you ask a girl to marry you, do you want her to just consider it?
or do you want her to just know?
it's Romeo Midnight, back again.
and if those topsy-turvy feelings have got you twisted inside-out...
think of the poet Rumi, who 800 years ago said:
all we really want is love's confusing joy.
Amen, brother.
she was there, huh?
is that it?
so this, you believe.
you don't buy it when she says yes to me...
but when she dumps me...
that you can wrap your head around.
I had a feeling.
excuse me? That it wasn't right, Reed.
man, you know, an inkling. An inkling?
you had an inkling, and you kept it to yourself?
you don't keep inklings to yourself. You share them. You're like:
Hey, guy. I got an inkling...
you're headed for a fall here." That's what friends do.
that's common knowledge. It's in the damn handbook.
I'm sorry, Reed. You're right.
I gotta stop Julia, don't I?
if it's the damn handbook, I think you better.
now, let's go.
next.
I'm going to visit my boyfriend. I'm surprising him.
Oh, yeah. Guys love surprises. Is that sarcasm?
I surprised my husband once. Now he's my ex-husband.
Oh, that sucks... Yes.
never touch security, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am. Copy that. Okay.
next. Have a nice day.
you too, ma'am.
I never had a inkling before. I didn't know what to do with it.
we gotta get to the airport.
Oh, shit. The flowers. Well, I'll deliver them. You go.
I don't have a car. All I have is this van.
my cousin Flaco lives nearby.
he's got a car you can borrow. It's a Chevy.
yeah?
a hybrid.
right over there.
guy leaves. I said, "We can't take the dog.
he says, "You know, he'll be right back...
Hi. I need your first ticket...
...out of terminal G to San Francisco.
this counter for oversized items.
right. L... But you sell tickets.
this counter for oversized items.
but you sell tickets, right?
that counter is for oversized people this counter is for oversized items, okay?
okay, here's my luggage.
now it's a matched set.
buddy, I'm 52 and I'm wearing a bright blue shirt to work.
please don't make me madder than I am. I'm sorry.
there's this girl. Don't tell me...
that'll take the fun out of guessing. Let's see. Gonna be a tough one.
there's a very pretty girl, and she's about to get on a big airplane.
and if you don't stop her, she'll never know how you really feel.
not exactly. What am I missing?
if she gets on the plane, she's gonna find out the hard way...
that the guy that she thinks she's in love with...
is a spineless, lying creep. That's no good.
no, it is no good, and I can't let that happen.
because this girl, she is great. She's like...
like sunshine.
everything is better when she's there.
I can't stand the idea of some jerk hurting her.
I just can't. I can't.
can you please be quiet...
so this nice young man can sell me a ticket. Please?
take it easy.
here, this'll get you to any gate in the place.
she's like sunshine, huh? Yeah.
well, in that case, it's on me. Go on, get out of here.
thank you.
thank you.
right this way. Come on. Let me see.
all right.
Hey, sir. Sir.
just a moment, sir. Attention please.
flight 464 to San Francisco...
is now boarding at gate 13 in terminal G.
the... The man left his shoes.
mister, the man forgot his shoes.
we've got a Code Foxtrot.
excuse me. Excuse me! We've got a Code Foxtrot.
Oh, on Mount Tam?
do you think? Because I heard there's a little restaurant...
he's a friend of mine. It's okay. What are you doing?
just... Where are your shoes? Are you okay?
he's married.
what? Harrison. He's married.
he was married, and now he's divorced.
no. He's still married.
her name is Pamela. They live in Brentwood.
I know because I delivered flowers to her.
I tried to tell you at the school.
did he say it was his current wife?
did he said "I'm sending flowers to my current wife"?
he didn't have to. I could tell.
like you could tell that my old boyfriend Eddie was gay.
Eddie was gay.
Eddie is married with two beautiful kids.
Eddie has a cat named Babs. You've tried to talk me out of every boyfriend since we've met.
I'm telling you the truth. I promise.
I'm going.
no, hang on, hang on. Come here, come here.
why, hello there. I'm with security.
do you think that Morley and I belong together?
what does that have to do with anything?
just tell me. Do you?
I don't know. If you love her and if she loves you...
answer the question. Fine.
no.
personally, I don't see it.
that's what I'm doing here.
because apparently everyone and their mother felt that way...
but nobody had the guts to tell me.
and now, I'm left with some stupid ring and an empty closet...
and an ache in my gut the size of Texas because nobody told me.
she left you. Today.
I'm sorry.
this will serve as your final boarding call for flight 464 to San Francisco.
I don't want this to happen to you.
I'm sorry about Morley...
but I'm going to see my boyfriend.
you know it's the truth.
sir, your shoes are still at security.
we're not allowed to touch them.
sir, what kind of man takes his shoes off and leave them off in public?
now, you know, it's some nasty stuff on these floors, sir.
sorry.
ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure you've noticed we're experiencing turbulence.
nothing to be concerned about but the captain has turned on the seat belt sign for safety.
please return to your seats until we pass through this...
...which should be in just a few minutes. Yeah.
watch your hands.
you look very pretty.
thank you.
are you nervous? Yes.
no reason to be. The minute you walk through that door nothing else...
is gonna matter.
thank you.
Franklin rules!
Hey, Edison, wanna warm up together?
Yeah, Edison. Warm up with your girlfriend.
grow up, Franklin.
are you gonna watch Discovery Channel tonight?
it's about giraffes. No, I can't.
I have to work at my mother's restaurant.
the one with the pointy towers? Yeah.
I went there for your birthday party.
it's a busy night for us.
we have a wedding, and a party for people...
who hate Valentine's Day.
why hate Valentine's Day? I don't know.
we have it every year, and it's all of Miss Fitzpatrick's friends.
Really?
not in Franklin's house!
come on, the game's starting!
edison, what the heck is wrong with you? I'm in love.
so am I, but I can move my feet.
did you see it? I went like this with my head.
I kicked the ball with my head! Didn't you see it?
Oh, I did see it, honey. Mommy's so proud of you.
let's go find Daddy.
I'm Kelvin Moore. Channel 13. Happy Valentine's Day.
welcome to the famous Hollywood Stars...
don't you know who I am, huh?
you think I wouldn't find you here? What are you doing?
I'm trying to work. Look at this, everyone!
this is not in... This isn't for pictures.
miss. Oh, mother, what's going on? Why so...?
cisco Martinez is a cheating rat.
she's loco. I don't know what she's talking about.
no, rata. You rata! Cisco! Cisco!
what are you doing? This is...
Oh, she kneed him in the gonads.
my goodness, I feel for you. The Dodger Dog.
I'm okay. Sleeping with them?
anyway, my name is Kelvin Moore.
happy Valentine's Day. KVLA, channel 13.
we done?
got a text. Sean Jackson is calling a press conference.
this could be my exclusive, okay?
listen, keep filming.
all right, do some B-roll or something like that, all right?
no worries, boss.
it's my day.
Hey, listen, I need to be able to talk to Kara for two seconds.
I already gave you everything on the press conference, so we are good.
I'm trying to do something special.
look at the profile. I'm from KVLA.
the number two sports guy.
on my way to number one.
I wanted to ask her one question about Sean Jackson.
I need to be able to ask Sean Jackson one question on camera.
she's on a conference call, she's very busy.
I don't know if I can... My bladder.
I gotta use the bathroom. Got a bathroom?
Oh, I dropped my notes.
no. You can't just barge into an... Kara. Kara.
damn. Oh, Kara. Are you okay?
Oh, do I look okay?
should we call a doctor?
no, it's this day.
Christmas, New Year's, Fourth of July, she's fine.
Valentine's Day, not so good.
what are you doing tonight, Kelvin?
I'm actually here about the Sean Jackson interview but we could talk.
relax, I'm not asking you out. I'm just curious.
how are you spending this happiest of all days?
let me just... You don't wanna call somebody?
I just wanna know if, in fact...
I am the only person on the whole freaking planet...
who is completely and 100-percent alone on Valentine's Day.
I asked you a question.
Yeah. I'm working.
9, 10, and 11: 00.
usually, I do two, but people want it off, so I'm happy to cover for them on this day.
you don't like to go out on Valentine's Day?
I hate it. Me too.
it's my fault I'm alone. I'm neurotic to the nth degree.
I don't have time to work on myself...
because I'm too busy fixing everyone else.
right. My closest relationship...
is with my BlackBerry.
right. Thank God it vibrates.
Oh, no. But do you know...
...who has always been there for me? Who's that?
my best friend. Candy. There's somebody.
I cannot get enough. And I know it's bad...
but I need it.
I need it, and there is not a shortage on Valentine's Day.
and that is my future.
I'll be a Ionely old lady with rotting teeth.
no, no, no. No, you're not.
and a chocolate mustache.
okay, maybe you should try some tofu or something.
okay. It'll balance out your emotions.
I don't want a mustache.
you'll look hot with a mustache.
or without it. It doesn't matter.
you can let go of me now. Yeah, I should.
well, I guess we're done here. All right.
you can check with Heather.
she'll validate your parking. You have a blessed day.
on your mark.
get set.
I'm Greg Gilkin at my old high school, Henderson High...
...and today's subject: Young love.
I'm joined by Felicia, whose boyfriend, Willy, will be joining us shortly.
Felicia, if he's the star athlete, you are...?
not the cheerleader.
I'm on the dance team.
maybe you could show us a little bit.
don't hurt yourself.
Yes. I haven't seen moves like that...
...since the '94 Northridge quake. You guys are...
how do you feel about each other this Valentine's Day?
Oh, my gosh. I totally love him. I'm crazy about her.
Willy, what is it about her that makes you so happy?
well, she's beautiful, she makes me laugh...
and she does my geometry. Bonus.
Yep. And, Felicia...
...what is it about Willy that's so cool?
what, besides the fact that he's totally hot?
he's an amazing athlete.
go show them, babe.
go show them, go show them.
he's so good.
how about this?
I cook her dinner and then serve it to her in front of a fireplace.
that says romance. That says cheap-o.
okay, not a problem.
I got her tickets to the movie at the Hollywood Cemetery.
Oh, yeah. Chicks love the cemetery...
...on Valentine's Day. Don't you think you should get a gift?
gift? I'm supposed to get her a Prius?
we've been dating for like two weeks.
is there a two-week gift?
if you want there to be a third week there is.
so how did you guys meet?
it's really funny, actually.
like, I was not into him at first.
he used to shoot spit wads at me in Spanish class...
...which is, like, so junior high.
but then one night I was brushing out my hair when I got home...
...and I found this spit wad, but it was really a note.
and it said, "What's up?" And I was like, "That is so cute.
and then I liked him.
Oh, my God. Baby, are you okay?
walk it off, baby. Just walk it off.
you're still hot, baby. You're still hot.
he rolled out of that like a ninja.
he's usually good at those.
he's quite the athlete, you're quite the dancer, huh?
five, six, seven, eight! No, I think... I think we're okay.
Oh, we haven't seen that one.
way to go. She tell you the spit-wad story?
she did.
Yeah, she's mushy like that. You like it.
I know. Oh, I miss high school.
there you have it, young love.
full of promise, full of hope...
...ignorant of reality. From Henderson High on Valentine's Day,
I'm Greg Gilkins. Channel 13.
okay.
sorry, Mr. E. but they can't get your flowers delivered today...
...but they'll figure it out tomorrow.
no, it has to be today. It has to.
Oh, just let him go. Let him go, let him go, let him go.
I'll tell you, today's a lot of pressure for anyone, let alone a little kid. Come on.
tell me about it. I haven't been having the best day myself.
is everything okay with Alex?
not really. Uh-oh. What happened?
Alex and I were supposed to...
...have sex today.
for the first time. For both of us.
I wanted it to be magical, and I'm realizing that...
...It's hard to plan something to be magical, you know?
Yes, that it is. Love can't be planned.
it's not love she is talking about, Edgar. It is sex.
he's going to Stanford.
I'm going to Yale. And it's just hit me recently that...
...It's gonna be really hard to stay together.
so I guess I thought that if we had this amazing thing connecting us...
...it'd make it easier, somehow, but I don't know...
...hearing myself say it out loud, it all sounds really stupid.
and it's not like I'm gonna sleep with one person for the rest of my life, right?
I mean, that's just crazy. Who does that?
Oh, crazy people like us. We did. No.
that's amazing. Well, granted, it was a different time...
...and people weren't as promiscuous as they are now.
and there were times we spent long periods apart, but we managed.
I'm not saying it was easy or suggesting it for you.
just saying it's possible.
and actually, we're gonna renew our vows this spring, right?
would you excuse us a minute? Yeah. I'm gonna take this.
Hey. No, I'm just at Edgar and Estelle's. What are you doing?
Alex, I gotta tell you something.
I don't know if today's the day.
I want it to be special, you want it to be special...
...and, you know, we tried to make it special, but, you know...
do you wanna go back there and see my mom after what happened earlier?
I don't think so.
all right, well, okay.
you know what, Alex, sorry. I need to call you back.
I have to go. I'll call you later. Bye.
Edison!
remember when you went away to Florida to build the apartments?
you remember that. And you were gone a very long time.
Yes.
you were gone so long.
I was so Ionely.
and...
well, Joey came over. It was my birthday, and he brought flowers, and
I sent you flowers, hon. Yes, you did.
and champagne.
Joey? Wait a minute.
Joey Keenan? Yes.
my business partner. That's right.
and we sat and we talked and we had dinner, and we...
and then...
it wasn't anything at first. And...
you had an affair. Yes. But it didn't last long, Edgar.
didn't last long, and we regretted it very much.
I'm so sorry.
you're the only man I've ever loved.
then why tell me now?
it's been bothering me. Our vows and everything.
and I wanted to tell you the truth.
the truth?
well, unfortunately, Estelle...
...the truth makes everything else seem like a lie.
I'm sorry.
why do you hate heart-shaped candy?
I think it's because it reminds me that this is Valentine's Day, and I'm recently single.
we weren't on the same page. Sorry.
it's okay. It's over. Nothing to be done?
no, no. I've seen the enemy and the enemy is me.
you could go for the stewardess. She seems to like you.
I think she likes everybody, that's her job.
she looks over here every 5 seconds.
no. Ready?
five, four, three... You wanna bet on it?
I'll bet you a bag of pretzels. Okay.
Oh, there it is. Okay. All right, that was a coincidence.
five, four, three... Stop it. Stop it.
looked on three. She's gonna come here. Excuse me.
can I get you anything? A bag of pretzels, please.
two, actually.
thank you for the flowers, Mr. Troken. Ready for your sponge bath?
Yes, please.
Hi, excuse me.
could I ask you a question?
I'm looking for Dr. Copeland. Is he here tonight?
not tonight, no.
sorry, Dr. Harrison Copeland.
not tonight.
could you tell me where I could find him?
are you a patient? Is something wrong?
look, can I ask you a question, just woman to woman?
okay.
is Dr. Copeland married?
not divorced or not separated...
...just full-on married to a woman named Pamela?
they just celebrated their 15th anniversary.
cardiology Center.
Los Angeles Hospital, may I help you?
bistro Garden, early seating.
Kara, I'm still here. I'm in L. A.
I have a lot to tell you. Give me a call when you can.
may I have your attention, please? I'm Sean's publicist...
...and recently there has been a lot of speculation about his future.
and rather than keep you all in suspense, he will make a brief statement at this time.
Hey, boss. Sorry, elevator took a year.
cleaning up?
I'm trying to be you. All right.
first off, I'd like to thank everyone for coming.
I know it's Valentine's Day and you might have other plans, so I'll be quick.
the cliche...
...when someone's retiring who doesn't wanna retire...
...is to say that it's because they wanna spend more time with their family.
I don't have a family, and with everything football has given me...
...the biggest thing it's taken away is that.
because of who I am...
...because of my job...
...I haven't been able to live the life I want to.
with that in mind, I'll just say the thing I came here to say.
I'm gay.
I knew it!
any questions? Are you kidding me?
and be cool, because I'm not above kicking anybody's ass.
Sean, you for real?
uh, first question.
Sean, come on, help me out.
Kelvin Moore, KVLA.
Sean, I'm confused here. Are you saying that you're retiring?
Oh, right, that.
no, Kelvin. No, I'm not retiring.
I'm gay, and I'm gonna play.
pick up the phone, Estelle. Edgar.
rosato martini with soda, table six. You got it.
I'm not really a waitress, I'm an actress.
I just did a day on Days of Our Lives.
happy Valentine's Day. Happy Valentine's to you.
you look beautiful. Thank you.
thank you. Olivia's gonna need braces.
well, that makes sense.
I had them, you had them. I know.
bistro Gardens restaurant.
good evening.
Hi. Harrison?
are you okay? Excuse me. Excuse...
you all right, sir? You okay?
great. Well, my name is Julia, and I'm gonna be your server tonight.
why don't I get started with a few specials?
Yes, please.
tonight the chef is featuring a dish that he likes to call the lying, stinking pig.
you're kidding. How is that cooked?
he starts by cutting off the pig's testicles...
...and he chops them up really finely, teeny, tiny pieces.
and then he takes those testicles, and he pulverizes them...
...and adds in a little arugula, some sage...
...feta cheese, and shoves the mixture...
...back up the pig's...
well, for lack of a better word, ass.
Really? Yeah. Then he cuts out the heart...
...the cold, useless, tiny, little heart...
...then fillets it on either side and it's a nice amuse-bouche.
I'll have the salmon. Good choice.
for you, sir?
I'm not... I don't... I don't know.
Oh, just so you know, the heart of the pig...
...little something like this.
did we get a toy?
maybe I'll give you a little time to juggle the choices, sir.
nicely done.
miss Fitzpatrick, my son Franklin really loves your class.
Oh, he's got a great imagination. Yeah.
so I guess we'll charge these to...
Oh, charge these to my friend over there. I figured.
I put in some lobster tails and a cheesecake.
thank you, Amos.
and then maybe these?
put that ticket right... Put it where you're looking. Yep.
Yep. Great. Thank you. Now let me take that thing.
thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Oh, crap. Just go.
golden Kadahi, best Indian restaurant in Los Angeles.
how may I help you?
Hi. This is Rehka speaking.
Hey, Liz. Oh, hi.
Hey. Hey.
I made it. Cannot even believe it.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Hi. Sorry.
wow, Liz, you look beautiful.
thank you. Paula's indefinite trip out of the office coincided very nicely...
with my "haul ass home and throw on something festive" plan, so...
you look wonderful.
Hi.
so... I was think...
what? Did you want...? Sorry. Go ahead. No, you first.
please. You should. You...
Oh, okay. You don't wanna be an agent, do you?
no, but I may need an agent...
...so I figure might as well learn the business while I'm agentless.
good evening, sir, ma'am. Welcome to The Blvd.
would you like the four-course Sweetheart's Menu...
...or the eight-course Eternal Love? Whoa, slow down.
is there, like, a one-course "Only Been Dating For Two Weeks...
...but It Looks Promising" option?
because...
I'm kidding.
I realize that, sir. I'll come back when you're serious.
he's your biggest fan.
Hello? That's my water.
you know, I didn't touch mine, so why don't you go ahead and have it?
happy Valentine's Day.
well, same to you.
Charlie! What?
she said happy Valentine's Day.
look... I can't talk now?
I'm sorry this place is such a zoo.
it's fine. I mean, they're fighting, they're mating, and I'm in the zoo with you.
God.
Jason, um, I really like you...
...and I was... I just...
I'm just wondering how you feel...
...about the idea of...
Oh, God. I've gotta... I'm gonna take this outside.
sure, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah. Go. Yeah. I'm sorry. Thank you.
go ahead.
be right back. Sure.
all right, Stanley, listen to me.
we're gonna make this hard, and we're gonna make this fast.
Yes, we can get you two adjoining rooms.
Yes. But with the door open, you still have to pay for both.
okay. Bye-bye now. Hi.
Hi. Welcome to the Beverly Wilshire.
how many checking in? Two.
two? I mean one.
well, technically, it's two. One person and Carmine, my dog.
a person and a dog. Okay, that would be our pleasure.
Oh, okay.
Oh, and by the way, happy Valentine's Day.
you too.
and Julia's not even in love with that guy.
how do you know that?
she was too calm about the whole thing.
I mean, always under control.
listen:
the way of love is not a subtle argument.
the door there is devastation." The master.
so according to Rumi, love has to be devastating?
listen. You don't step into love, my friend, you fall in. Head over heels.
you ever seen somebody fall head over heels in love for real, Reed?
it's ugly, bro. Toxic, septic.
come on, boss. Still got a few hours left.
make something happen with somebody someplace.
cookie? I'm good.
day's not over yet, man. Give me some.
Hey, tell me something. How'd you and your wife get it so right?
that's easy. I married my best friend.
thought I was your best friend.
Yeah, you're my man. That's my lady.
night. Good night.
go give your wife those cookies, huh? Best for the best.
Yeah. Best for the best.
Kate. Hey, have a great trip. Thanks. Nice meeting you.
Yeah.
this is my taxi! No, no, I been waiting.
I been waiting 45 minutes. Be a little patient, folks.
Hey, Redmond. Welcome back, Mr. Wilson.
did you have to wait long? Not long at all.
check any bags? No.
they're right through there.
may I help you, captain?
thank you.
you okay?
no, I'm fine. It's just the SuperShuttle, it's gonna take nine stops to get to my house.
thought I'd pay for a cab, and I go there, and the line's two miles long.
now I'm headed to the rental car place.
which is gonna take an hour.
I'm gonna help. Really?
Yeah, I have a car.
I live in the Valley.
I want you to have it. You traveled so far for a few hours.
you should spend every possible second with this guy.
and it's already paid for.
redmond will take you wherever you need to go.
you just give him the address.
thank you. Thank you.
he's a lucky man.
thank you. Bye.
rani, sweetheart, why are you moping?
is this about a boy because it's Valentine's Day?
did you get many valentines? Oh, sweetheart, don't be sad.
when the time is right, your father and I...
...we are going to find you a nice Indian boy.
Hey, cheer up, Rani. I'll be your valentine.
Alex, please, for now, be our delivery boy.
I have an Indian wedding, and I have a private party going on.
perfect.
Beverly Wilshire, this is Michelle.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to put you on hold. All right, thanks. Bye-bye.
excuse me.
you didn't happen to see a really pretty girl, blue dress, come through here?
are you a guest of the hotel, or...?
no, we were at the early seating.
okay. Yeah, she was on the phone, and she just went out that way.
Oh, okay. Thanks. Yeah, no problem.
put the blindfold on right now, Stanley.
Oh, you know what's gonna happen when you do.
sugar and your little kitty cat...
...Oh, we're gonna lick you all up and down.
scratchy little tongues going up and down your...
Oh! Rrrrr. Mm.
Oh, Stanley,
I'm gonna have to have a mint julep to cool down after that one.
talk to you next time. Thank you.
Oh, God.
that is a really unusual way to talk to your boss.
it's not what you think. Really? Oh, awesome.
because what I think it is you leaving me to talk dirty to your boyfriend, Stanley. So...
no, no, no. What a relief to know...
...you're not someone who licks people with their scratchy kitty-cat tongue.
I moonlight as an adult-phone entertainer.
like phone sex? Yes.
this is the busiest day of the year for phone sex.
surprise.
why didn't you tell me?
okay.
I'm broke. I have a hundred-K student loan
I have no idea how I'm going to pay off.
I have no health insurance.
so if you know of a job that will pay a poetry major...
...more than $40 an hour, with her clothes on, I'm all ears.
okay.
I'm out. Are you gonna call me?
well, you know, I'd like to say yes, but...
...I don't know if I can afford it.
I'm sorry, that was... I'm sorry.
come on, you know I didn't mean that. I'm just... This is, like...
this is way too much for me, okay?
I'm from Muncie, Indiana.
like, the wildest thing I ever did was...
...leave Muncie, Indiana.
look, this is me, it's not you. Yeah.
I just...
I'm sorry, Liz.
welcome to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.
enjoy your romantic evening.
please, everyone form a single-file line.
she said she would meet me right before showtime. Here it is...
...but she's not here yet, and...
I got her these flowers because I'm so sorry.
I mean, it was a small fire. It's a small dog.
everything's fine, and...
we're sold out.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but we are completely sold out.
only pre-sold tickets.
no, you don't understand. I need a ticket tonight.
but I mean, I packed a basket. It's got her favorite.
ham hocks and squid and... Actually...
...you know what, sir?
I have an extra ticket.
Oh, that's your ticket? That's my ticket.
it's your lucky night. Have a great time.
all right, everyone, we are sold out.
so who do I thank? Jason, from Indiana.
Edgar, from New York.
Yeah, my wife and I used to come here every Valentine's Day, but...
well, except tonight.
well, you know, I had the extra ticket, so...
on Valentine's Day. Well, there's gotta be a story there.
well, yeah, not a good one.
pretty much the worst Valentine's Day story of all time.
you wanna bet?
thank you, officers.
thank you, Nikki. They're beautiful. Thank you.
Siena Bouquet.
Yeah, we're still open for about another hour.
mister?
you owe me flowers.

peppermint Pattie? Yep.

step on the grass.
this telephone girl, you like her, huh?
thought maybe she had the trifecta.
trifecta? What's that?
Oh, you know, it's like the big three S's.
smart, sensitive, sexy.
that's my trifecta.
her? Mm-hm.
you mean, like, literally, that...?
literally. Her. She was hot.
still is.
Hey, hey.
you guys came! You're here!
I thought you were going out with your new boyfriend.
I thought you had a date with your old boyfriend.
same guy.

booked back-to-back at the same restaurant.
thought we wouldn't notice.
what? Please lead me to the alcohol.
right here. Sit down. We are gonna take good care of you.
what happened to the pinata?
Oh, it got what it deserved. Oh, more sad and Ionely people.
Hey, guys. Hey, Elise.
I'm driving around, looking in all the places he's probably gonna be, but...
anyways, like I said, just call me back.
but no big deal, I've got it under control, so I'll find him.
I've found him! Found him.
Oh, my God, he's in a van.
shit! What are you doing in a van?
Edison!
burn, baby, burn!
Justin Levy.
broke up with me on the morning of my birthday...
...still showed up to my party.
burn, baby, burn!
Ivonne Quinteros.
dumped me for the piano player at the Beverly Wilshire.
two hours ago. Oh, Charlie.
burn, baby, burn! Fire marshal know about this burning pot?
Oh, hey, Kelvin. Hey.
back to the wine.
what are you doing here? I had a little time...
...before my 10: 00 broadcast, somebody said there was a gathering of my people.
how did you find us? Heather.
right, right. Well, welcome.
Hi. I'm Julia. I'm Kelvin.
Hi. So you guys know each other? Yes.
what misadventure of the heart brings you here?
Oh, actually, I'm Kara's date.
fascinating. Yeah.
Whoo.
Edison! All right, buddy.
don't move! I'm really, really sorry.
okay, but you can't do that to me. Do you understand?
I know, I know. But this was really important.
she had to get her flowers. Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm his babysitter. I'm his florist.
look, I'm glad you're okay.
do you want me to come in there with you?
no. I think this is one of those things I have to do myself.
I've been driving Holden for a long time.
he's never given his car up for anybody.
you must be pretty special.
over? Why do you keep talking like it's over?
I love you.
Edgar!
Hey, get out of the way! I'll always love you.
Edgar! Excuse me.
down in front!
Edgar, where are you? I know you're out there.
Shh!
who the hell is Edgar?
he is my husband, and shut your mouth.
Edgar, answer me. Answer her, Edgar.
lady, I can't see through you.
Edgar, where are you?
estelle! Edgar, answer me.
estelle! That must be Edgar.
I'm here! I'm coming.
sorry.
I see. Hey, run lower!
listen to me. I know I let you down.
maybe you don't think I deserve forgiveness...
but you're gonna give it to me anyway, because when you love someone...
...you love all of them. That's the job.
I know that now.
I'm so sorry.
and now, please, you gotta love everything about them.
not just the good things, but the bad things too.
the things that you find lovable, and the things that you don't find lovable.
Shh. I understand.
I'll never leave you.
at first I was afraid, I was petrified
kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
and I grew strong and I learned how to get along
and so you're back from outer space
Julia, I found this little friend of Rani's, and I think he's looking for you.
I'm not little.
edison, are you okay? Does somebody know that you're here?
Yeah, my babysitter's outside.
okay.
Oh, now go. Go
walk out the door. Out that door
just turn around now
this is for you.
for me? You're my valentine.
thank you.
Oh, this is beautiful.
Wha...?
are you sure that I am really the person that you wanna give this to?
Yeah. I mean, I think so.
Why?
well, when you pick a valentine you have to be sure that you choose the right person.
or else you could be overlooking someone who's even more special to you.
Rani? But I don't love her. I love you.
is it our age difference that keeps you from going:
boom, boom, boom.
Yeah, a little bit.
is it my height? Because I'm gonna grow.
well, then, no, it's not your height.
it's just it wouldn't be right, because I know Rani likes you.
Really? Well, I like her a lot too.
she's the only other fifth-grader who has Frank Zappa on her iPod.
see? And she loves giraffes.
see, giraffes, it's something you guys have in common.
see, it's things like that that can turn a friend...
...from someone that you like into someone that you love.
has that ever happened to you, Miss Fitzpatrick?
Hello?
Hey, hey
back to the chocolate!
I am the chocolate.
Oh, you are. Thank you so much for coming.
you are the most special valentine I have ever had.
but it was great. And bye. Bye.
don't know how to do that. I'll teach you.
there you go. Right on... There it is. Close. Okay.
I know, you gotta go to work.
Bolly, bolly!
here. Happy Valentine's Day.
I don't usually go for girls my own age, but you're pretty cool.
wow, thanks.
I don't really have anything else to say.
now I'm wondering If your love's still strong
here I am Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
I saw Edison.
I tipped the valet to keep an eye on him.
I have the delivery van set up over there.
we could take a trip to Mulholland. Come check it out.
Alex, can I be honest with you?
I love it when you're honest.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
lie to me. No, look, I'm serious.
signed, sealed, delivered
I'm gonna go now.
signed, sealed, delivered
Bye.
I guess that I thought that if we did this, we'd have this special bond...
...and now I'm realizing that something like this you can't just plan, you know?
it has to happen.
I mean, we have a chance to make it happen.
but did you hear what you said, "make it happen"?
we shouldn't have to make it happen.
look, sit.
this is so sweet, and...
look, Alex, I love you. I just...
I really think we should wait.
I'm sorry.
it's okay. I love you too.
and...
...we can still make out.
Bye.
Paula Thomas. Whoever this is better have a good reason for calling me this late.
you want me to do what?
boy, do you know who you're talking to?
Vladimir.
well, let me tell you something, Vladimir.
you don't know what rough is until you've dealt with a true African queen.
let me get my stick.
kneel to Nzinga!
attention, I'm going home now.
but I wanted to say goodnight to the world's greatest boss...
...and tell him that we all love him.
good night, Nikki.
you saw.
Yeah.
I'd like to take to comment on the story that we broke earlier.
quarterback sensation Sean Jackson...
...has popped the lock on the closet and come out.
what does this mean?
will there be more house music played in the locker room?
these questions aside,
Mr. Jackson's name is likely to be remembered...
...alongside Jackie Robinson,
muhammad Ali, and Billie Jean King...
...who endured their share of trash-talking as well.
but let's allow future generations to decide where to place Sean Jackson in history.
it's not about defiance...
...It's about what a man will do for love.
I stand behind you, Sean. Metaphorically.
Oh, jeez. Thank you.
good night.
and that's it for tonight's news.
happy Valentine's Day to all of you.
sherry Donaldson for KVLA, channel 13.
good. Hey, man. Excellent.
Hey, way to go, bro. Cue music, cue logo.
you sneaky little cupid.
you got romantic after all, didn't you?
I may get a few letters on that, but I got your back.
thank you. Happy Valentine's Day, Kelvin.
same to you.
well, those stairs never looked so good.
interesting perspective on Sean Jackson.
just a second.
who is it?
you forgot your camera.
can I come in?
sure.
Jason, I feel bad about how you found out about my job.
it was awkward, and I'm sorry.
but that is the only thing that I apologize for.
no. I should be the one apologizing.
if you want to be a adult phone entertainer...
...that's cool.
I don't know, Jason.
when you found out something about me you didn't like, you judged me and bailed.
I don't think that's a promising foundation for a relationship.
you know what? You're right. I just spent all night in a cemetery.
and I actually learned something.
in a relationship...
...you have to accept the other person...
...for all of what they are, not just the parts that are easy to like.
and you're stupid if you turn your back on something as important...
...as...
...Love.
so I bought this for you. At the store.
and this one goes...
sugar can't answer the phone right now.
she's got to make love to her boyfriend on Valentine's Day.
and, for the record, this is what I like.
simple.
Yeah.
let's just keep it really simple.
I also like make-up sex. Whoa, what a coincidence.
you too? Me too.
Yay!
Hi.
sorry. Yeah.
what are you doing with the flowers?
they're all the ones that nobody wants.
so you're giving them a second life?
Yeah, most shops throw them away.
I like the idea that tomorrow, somebody's gonna see them floating by and...
Yeah.
wonder where they come from. And the mystery of it all.
I used to actually put them together...
...and practice new designs with them...
...and drop them off at a random doorstep with a note saying:
somebody out there loves you.
then I got to thinking...
...what if they found out that someone was me?
would they want me to be the one that loves them?
I would...
...want that.
am I about to kiss my best friend?
I hope so.
not great. That was awkward. Awkward.
just not great. Yep.
but this is my old...Where I get down.
this is your spot.
you really helped me out. Susan is...
giving me a chance to be number one. Congratulations.
thank you, again. Thank you.
I'm gonna have to teach you. That is...
no... I'll teach you this. It's not natural.
keep the fist... It's a little... Thank you. Okay.
no, no, no. Open your... Open.
you know what? I got a better idea. Not happening.
okay.
that was nice.
well, you didn't exactly, like, knock it out of the park.
well, we've never practiced, you have to admit.
maybe we should practice, then. Okay.
mommy!
you're so big.
you're so big.
did you imagine it better or worse? I did.
you imagined it better? I gave you more credit.
Really? Yeah.
well, I hate that I'm not living up to my...
well, I don't know.
it's Romeo Midnight, one last time.
only 30 seconds left now before it's just another day.
so count it down with me, lovers.
and raise your glass to those three little words that we all want to hear:
let's get naked.
I never had a inkling before, man. I didn't know what to do.
I need to get to the airport.
stupid...!
Vladimir! Let me get my whip.
you know I always wanna answer yours first...
Oh! Just... Let's do...
I never had a inkling before. I didn't know what to do with it.
shoot, we gotta get to the...
it's stupid. Stupid seat belt!
Oh, there's a... Hold it, there's a finger in there.
you on Facebook?
I can't hear out of this ear.
are you guys on Facebook?
I never had a inkling before. I didn't know what to do with it.
all right. I gotta get to the airport.
she's probably at the gate by now.
how did you do that?
Hey, I'm Taylor. And I'm Taylor. Too.
Yeah. It's confusing. Yeah, we know that.
marker.
if you look out the window, ma'am...
...we're passing the famous Rodeo Drive.
have you ever shopped here? I did once, actually.
but, big mistake. Big. Huge.
pilot [O VER RADIO]: Anderson, P- 170. I have Stetko returning.
we'll be approaching in about five. Am I clear?
male TECH: It's all you. Come on in, the party's already started.
pilot: Isn't it a little early for that?
male TECH: First big winter storm coming in later in the week.
we're swapping personnel a couple days early.
pilot: Roger that. See you in a few.
operations TECH [O VER PA]: Attention, flight teams:
will the following pilots please report to station chief ASAP...
HADEN: Stetko, where have you been?
operations TECH: This is a 72-hour warning, people.
that's three days until the last flight for those of you mathematically challenged.
I'm supposed to let you know that we have one of those season-and-safety meetings...
... with Dr. Cochran before tonight's station-closing party.
everyone must attend. 1900 in the galley.
hold on a second, I was just handed a piece of paper.
Sam says that bag drag will start at 0700 on Friday.
so all your gear must be in the hallway by 0300.
make sure all your personal belongings...
for those in the winter crew who are staying on base...
... there will be a mandatory...
man: Carrie?
I'm in the shower, Doc.
I'll be right out.
chicken.
shrimp? You've been holding out on me, woman.
you wanna hear about my trip?
I flew three hours to talk to a Ph. D. Reporting the theft of a botany sample.
a botany sample?
cannabis sativa.
Ah. Of course, cannabis. Weed.
always a dull moment.
by the way, big storm's coming in, departure's been bumped up.
bathing suit and sunscreen are packed and ready to go.
well, all you need.
woman [O VER RADIO]: Stetko? You there? - Hold on, hold on.
go. - The station manager wants to see you.
copy. See you at dinner.
no, you won't. This is dinner.
better than that mess-hall crap.
see you on the plane. - What? You're kidding.
no, you heard me. - Doc?
we'll talk about it later, okay?
Sam: Popsicle was spotted out here at Haworth Mesa.
pilot I borrowed from McMurdo called it in.
Really? What was somebody doing out there? That's no man's land.
it's probably a weather balloon or an old tent. It's the guy's first year here.
I know you just got back, but he reports it, you gotta follow it up.
okay. Don't worry, I'll go grab Doc.
Hey, Carrie.
Sam, please don't waste my time. Just tell me how many carats.
well, don't gush until you see it. Then you just let it flow.
you made as much on backgammon as you did from the Marshal Services.
you should go pro.
maybe that's what I'll do when I get back to the States.
you're still handing in your badge, huh?
Yeah. They even have professional backgammon players?
the same rules apply to all winter-over students.
you'll have 90 days to turn in your analysis.
I want proxies for the earth's temperature changes from 1600 to present day.
let's see how long before they're surfing in Kansas.
operations TECH: Attention, South Pole: This is a flight notification for Papa 282.
that aircraft has been delayed and is now due at 1530.
CARRIE: Doc? - All teams, adjust your schedules.
good day, marshal. - Haden, have you seen Doc?
Yeah, he's outside with the newbies.
Hey, marshal, don't you owe me a strip search?
you were the second guy out the door, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, not interested.
John: In less than three days, we begin the winter-over.
the sky turns black and it stays that way for half a year.
now, nature did not intend for you to survive out here.
but here you are...
...and here I am to teach you how not to die.
come on.
nothing to it.
time.
core body temperatures have fallen to approximately 97 degrees.
thinking is impaired.
motor skills failing.
you are, in short, gentlemen, well on your way to dying...
...and it's only been three minutes.
one great hazard out here: The whiteout.
an unholy set of weather conditions converge...
...and the world falls away.
winds over 100 miles an hour skip off the ice out here...
...and kick up snow so thick you can't see six inches in front of your face.
you can lose yourself completely out there.
and be gone.
all right.
never underestimate the ice. Put your coats on now.
now, class, give a nice, warm South Pole hello to Marshal Stetko.
men: Hello, Marshal Stetko.
Hi, guys.
what's up? - I need you to take a ride with me.
a pilot named Delfy thinks he may have found a body on the ice.
this engine is ice cold.
you can't put the goddamn blower on for five minutes and expect to start the plane.
what changed your mind? I thought you were wintering over again.
I got a card from my granddaughter inviting me to her 5th birthday party.
you have a granddaughter?
I have a granddaughter, Carrie, and I've never met her.
I've been down here way too long.
you Delfy? - Last I remember.
I'm Stetko. This is John Fury.
are you old enough to fly this thing? DELFY: Certainly hope so.
just try not to have a heart attack on my plane, junior.
smartass.
well, I think I'm gonna like him.
Delfy [O VER RADIO]: ASB, ASB, come in.
this is November 178. I'm five minutes out from Haworth Mesa.
how's the weather? Over.
asb MAN: Weather is clear.
Roger, ASB. I'll inform you on turnaround.
you asleep?
Yep.
I could fly down here the rest of my life and never get used to how beautiful it is.
CARRIE: How did he get here?
maybe he was climbing, fell from up there.
then where's his gear?
it doesn't make any sense.
how could he be all the way out here without any gear?
he's a sticker. Give me a hand.
okay.
go.
John: Carrie?
are you all right?
Yeah.
let's see who he is.
Weiss.
Weiss. Yeah, I knew him.
Yeah, we wintered with him last year, played cards a couple times.
he's the one that cheated. - The geologist.
Yeah.
damn. Damn, damn.
what were you doing all the way out here?
watch this. - Yes.
man: Whoo-hoo-hoo!
got it.
million-year-old ice, right? - Yes.
ten-year-old whiskey. Yeah? - Ten-year-old whiskey.
this is cool.
John: Out of the way.
man AND WOMAN: Ugh!
John: Move it!
out of the way.
it bothers me that nobody's reported him missing yet.
maybe no one thinks he is.
what's this?
well, let's find out.
it's a fresh wound.
somebody treated him in the field. - Yeah.
and they were in a hurry.
what's happened up here?
Oh, my God.
what could have caused that?
rough edges around the wound.
ice ax, something like that.
so we got a geologist out at Haworth Mesa.
he injures his leg, has it stitched...
...then manages to climb a 100-foot ice wall...
...falls onto his own ax, which isn't found anywhere near the body?
doc, this wasn't an accident.
this means a federal investigation.
we're witnesses.
I know you wanna get out of here, Carrie, and the last plane leaves in two days.
we could be stuck here for the winter.
can you handle that?
no.
I mean, God, I don't know.
say the word, I'll bag the body, put it on the plane for McMurdo.
let them sort it out. No big deal.
CARRIE: I won't take no for an answer, Jack.
Jack: I have plans Saturday.
CARRIE: Microwave popcorn and a six-pack is not plans. We're clear.
go.
how we doing? Good.
why don't you get some sleep? You earned it.
that was all you today.
Sam: Carrie.
so it was a popsicle.
but please, next time you find a dead body, don't parade him down the corridor.
Sam, he was murdered.
you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
his name was Weiss. He was one of ours. We gotta call it in.
Yeah.
see how the FBI wants to handle it.
what camp's he with? - I don't know. I gotta talk to McGuire.
tech [O VER RADIO]: 131, confirming to instruct Departure 133. 0, Squad 4233.
CARRIE: Anton Weiss.
michael Rubin. John Mooney.
what do they do at that camp? - One One is an ablation zone.
English? - It's a good place to find meteorites.
it's right there.
well, Weiss was nowhere near that camp when we found him.
wait a minute. Weiss?
a few days ago, someone from Delta-One One called, looking for him.
I asked around, but nobody had seen him.
didn't you think it was odd that they called here looking for one of their own guys?
not at the time.
was that the last communication you had with that camp?
let me see.
what's their frequency?
Delta-One One, South Pole, this is United States Marshal Carrie Stetko, over.
Delta-One One, South Pole, this is United States Marshal Stetko.
how copy? Over.
let me see the log.
tech: Carrie Stetko, please call Comm at 282.
Stetko. JAMIE: Marshal, it's Jamie.
I've got some guy holding from Vostok.
he won't give his name. He says he has to talk to you.
Vostok? All right, patch him through.
you're on now.
this is Marshal Stetko. Who is this?
Mooney: This is John Mooney, marshal.
what happened out there, Mooney?
you know who I am?
come in and let's talk. MOONEY: No.
I can't come in. You have to come to Vostok.
only you.
why would I want to go to Vostok? - Just come to Vostok. Please.
CARRIE: Look, I got a better idea. I'll send a plane. You come here.
just come to Vostok and you'll understand everything.
man: Rhonda, we have a real situation developing.
this storm is coming in fast, 10 hours earlier than we first calculated.
fly eight runs?
sorry, guys. We need to put up as many planes as possible.
HADEN: What is this, Top Gun?
how am I supposed to make eight runs on three hours' sleep?
same way as everyone else will: By the skin of your teeth.
Rhonda, I need a plane to Vostok. - Good luck. All my planes are committed.
pullouts are completely screwed because of this front.
CARRIE: I need Delfy.
Rhonda, I'm not asking.
operations TECH: Listen up, all personnel.
the expected storm is now calculated to arrive 10 hours earlier.
new evac timetable has therefore been accelerated.
all personnel will be on the tarmac...
... 10 hours before previous embarkation. JACK: Why don't you get sleep?
you earned it.
that was all you today.
CARRIE: Jack!
Jack!
operations TECH: This is a station-wide announcement:
all department heads must attend a meeting at 1900 hours...
... to discuss the updated evac schedule. This meeting is mandatory.
whoa, what's going on?
so I'm in McGuire's office. One of Weiss's missing team members calls.
which one? - Mooney.
Yeah, I heard of him.
anyway, he's at Vostok, the old Russian base.
I thought they already evac'd for the winter.
far as I know, they did. He wouldn't talk over the phone.
who's on your wing?
Delfy. I'll be fine.
you will be fine or you are fine?
now, that's the same look you had when you first came into my office.
that's not true. I had a great tan then.
Delfy [O VER RADIO]: Carrie, it's Delfy. You there?
go. - All fueled up and clear skies...
... with a balmy minus-50. Ready when you are.
that will be now.
you know how I feel?
frustrated.
I've been down here for two years, dealing with misdemeanors.
mindless, simple. No thinking, no problem.
that was the plan, and it worked.
I thought I was past it. - Miami.
Yeah. Ever since I saw Weiss's body...
...It's been like 85 degrees and 80 percent humidity.
Yeah, well, time is irrelevant.
that's why they invented Scotch.
tech: There are now only 56 hours... - Have a good trip.
... left for all personnel on the winter fly out. - Thanks.
be sure that you begin your preparations on time.
we really ought to get back to base. - There's one more building to check.
it's really dropping out there. You sure you want to do this?
sure you want to be there when I open this door?
CARRIE: Mooney? It's Carrie Stetko.
Mooney?
Mooney?
Mooney?
shit.
Aah!
Ooh!
Oh.
why don't you get some sleep? You earned it.
CARRIE: Jack!
Jack! DELFY: Hey, Carrie. Carrie, it's me.
you're okay. Carrie, it's me. It's okay.
Hey, hey, Carrie. Hey, Carrie.
it's me, it's Delfy.
you're okay.
you all right? You with me?
you're okay.
I found you in the ready room half-conscious. I carried you here.
you've been out ever since.
Mooney's dead.
there was a man. He... He killed Mooney.
and he tried to kill me too.
he must still be here somewhere.
how's your chin?
it's better than your hand.
how bad?
bad enough you don't wanna see.
I gotta get back out there.
CARRIE: Hey. Let me see your hands.
hit the lights. DELFY: Right.
who are you? MAN: Relax. I've got ID.
CARRIE: Where are the lights?
man: Get that light out of my face now.
robert Pryce?
I'm with the U. N. Special Investigations Division.
DELFY: Got it.
I went to Pole to talk to you about Weiss.
how do you know about Weiss? - FBI notified us.
your base commander, Murphy, called it in.
I was dropped here after the weather cleared.
been here for a few hours, thought I'd let you two sleep.
you mind lowering that gun?
mind telling me why the U. N.'s interested in the murder of a geologist?
this isn't just a murder.
this is the first murder in Antarctica...
...and now our second. I don't have to tell you how sensitive this is.
we don't want this to become an international issue.
right. - U. N. Wants our eyes on the ground...
...someone to track it, control the information.
and that's you? - That's me.
it's late. We better get to Delta-One One while the weather holds.
wait. I don't need your help.
I can see we're getting off to a really good start here.
you don't want to share your toys. I can do that.
like I can say, I'm within my rights to commandeer your plane...
...and your pilot if I have to.
he can.
it's your choice.
you got to Pole awfully fast.
I was in McMurdo when the call came in.
Robert: You didn't get a look at the guy who came after you?
Yeah, 6 feet, 175, ECW gear head-to-toe.
sound like anyone you know?
I got there after the whiteout.
so you say.
Robert: Oh, jeez.
haven't acclimated yet.
well, if you were in McMurdo, you weren't there long.
we're on approach. Buckle up.
Delfy [O VER RADIO]: ASB, this is November 178.
I'm landing at camp Delta-One One with Marshal Stetko and Agent Robert Pryce.
can you give me an update?
woman: November 178, there's been no significant change in the approaching system.
I'll keep you updated if anything develops.
DELFY: Roger, ASB. We'll inform you on turnaround.
be careful around him. - Right.
here's a map of their work site.
they searched it in a grid pattern.
CARRIE: Looks like they stopped on grid 104.
I've only been out here a couple of months...
...but when did det cord and blasting caps become standard issue for geology camps?
there's gotta be 40 pounds of plastic.
what the hell were they doing?
they were supposed to be searching for meteorites on the surface.
we better head out there.
Robert: You seem to know your high explosives, Delfy.
DELFY: I learned to recognize them pretty quick.
Robert: Karbala?
DELFY: Baghdad. Support runs. You?
somewhere in the same region, yeah.
well, my friend, it looks like we just traded one desert for another.
but one hell of a lot colder.
so how we doing?
we're almost there. DELFY: Good.
how does ex-military wind up down here working for the U. N?
it was an open post.
so really, how does a U. S. Marshal like you end up in Antarctica?
open post.
we're here.
DELFY: There's nothing here.
let's head back.
you sure this is right?
section 104. These are the coordinates.
maybe you wrote it down wrong.
this ice has been worked.
they were digging here.
looks like they spread the ice out to cover whatever they found.
DELFY: Marshal!
Robert: Stetko!
Stetko! - Marshal!
marshal. CARRIE: Uhn.
Robert: You okay?
just sit tight.
I saw a rope in the Cat.
if you're hurt, try not to move.
Robert: Watch the rope.
okay, I'm coming down.
CARRIE: Guess they found what they were looking for.
what the hell happened here?
you see all that blood behind us?
Robert: Yes, I did.
it's a cargo plane.
is it American?
DELFY: No, I don't think so. But whatever it is, it's an antique.
CARRIE: How long do you think this has been here?
DELFY: Russian vodka.
could be an Antonov An-12. These things haven't flown for 50 years.
CARRIE: Oh, my God.
what? What is it? CARRIE: It's a body.
looks like he's been shot in the head.
here's another.
Robert: We got another one over here.
CARRIE: Why is one of the pilots back here? DELFY: Who knows?
DELFY: We really should be heading back.
Stetko.
well, that would explain how they crashed.
they were in the air.
pilot stayed at the stick while the copilot went back to take out the passengers.
CARRIE: He must have surprised the first guard, but missed the others.
and the other guards returned fire on the copilot. Bang, bang.
the guards and the copilot take each other out, and the pilot caught a stray.
ice swallows them whole. Jesus.
but over what?
Where's Pryce?
what have you found?
Robert: Nothing. We're too late.
be careful.
Oh, God. Looks like fresh blood.
it's gotta be Weiss's.
CARRIE: Weiss had an injury to his leg.
he must have cut it getting into this box.
whatever was in there was what they were after.
that's his blood in the shaft.
he left a trail as they dragged him out.
Robert: Right.
you're not surprised by any of this.
you knew this was here.
talk to me, Pryce.
Robert: Two days ago...
...someone down here contacted an arms dealer on the watch list.
he was arranging the sale of six canisters recovered from an old Soviet transport.
containing what? - We're not sure.
during the '50s, the Soviets mined down here...
...for material to use in their nuclear program.
if that's what the geologists found in this box...
...and it makes its way onto the open market...
why didn't you tell me any of this before? - I wasn't sure...
...if your murders and my canisters were connected.
CARRIE: Oh, they're connected.
you hear that?
DELFY: We're gonna run out of air long before anyone finds us.
Yeah, that's if we don't freeze to death first.
anything?
no.
great.
well, it looks like we're gonna have to dig ourselves out of here.
with what? That ice has got to be 20 feet deep.
just trying to keep it upbeat.
CARRIE: Nobody knows we're down here.
Yeah. Thanks for reminding me.
don't make them like that anymore.
let's hope Captain America over there has got a plan.
Robert: The backup oxygen's empty, must have been damaged in the crash.
Oh, great.
Hey. - Yeah?
you think when that guy boarded this plane, he had any idea he'd end up like this?
Oh, my God. - What?
that's why Weiss wasn't wearing any ECW gear when we found him.
that's why there was no ax found near the body.
wait, wait, wait, you're losing me.
the only way in or out of Vostok is by plane...
...which means the killer had to have access to one.
that's why Weiss was so busted up.
you think that's why he was at Haworth Mesa?
Yeah, I think somebody killed him and dropped him out of a plane.
this little revelation doesn't happen to come with an escape plan, does it?
we're fucked.
Robert: Listen, Delfy, I've been thinking. Does this plane have a main-hold bail out?
DELFY: Yeah, it's usually on the ceiling, in case of an ocean landing.
Robert: Here.
explosive bolts.
we blow the hatch, we punch a hole through the ice.
at this angle, the surface can't be more than 10 feet above us.
no, no, no. Whoa, you're asking a lot of 60-year-old bolts.
if the ice is too thick, the blast will come right back on us.
we can blow ourselves up, suffocate, or freeze to death. You take your pick.
do it.
we need a power source.
CARRIE: Here, there may be enough juice left in the SAT-phone battery.
Robert: Oh, that's smart.
DELFY: Come on, it's cold.
you guys might want to take some cover.
fire in the hole.
DELFY: Oh, that's beautiful.
now let's stack these crates and get the hell out of here.
Carrie! Delfy! Come on!
okay, let's hope we have enough juice left to start it.
come on.
Oh, fuck. All right, all right. Let's just let it sit for a second.
Oh, don't. It'll lower your core temperature.
all right. Give me some of that.
that's what I thought. That's what I thought.
crazy.
I understand a bunch of Cold War Russians killing each other over that box...
...but how did three Ph. D's get wrapped up in some shit like this?
it's this place. Try it again.
come on, baby.
Yes.
operations TECH [O VER PA]: Attention, the transport plane...
... will arrive at 0900 hours for anyone who is not staying on base for the winter.
bag drag must be completed two hours prior to wheels up.
all gear, equipment...
you need to get your hand checked out. - I will.
failure to do so will result...
I'm gonna update my office and tell them what we found.
Sam: You're not listening to me, Bill.
look, I've already got two bodies on my hands...
...and God knows what stolen from a Russian plane.
bill: I know, it's a bad situation.
I wanna evac the base. No winter-overs.
evac the base? I'm not sure we can do that.
I have to call you back. - You're pulling everybody off the ice?
I can't take the chance of having my people stranded down here...
...with this guy running around. - Don't think I can do my job?
that's not what I said.
any calls on Rubin?
no, but we've got his face out to all bases.
fine, thanks.
Carrie.
operations TECH [O VER PA]: Attention, all personnel:
the station manager has just informed me of a change in schedule.
due to recent incidents, the base is going into lockdown...
... for the duration of the winter season.
this includes all international science teams.
repeat, this is a mandatory...
all are required to depart on the plane.
[MOUTHS] What the hell?
no one will be wintering over. SAM: Carrie.
it's not that you aren't capable of handling this.
I'm just trying to keep my people safe. - Sam, when I examined Weiss...
...his core wasn't frozen solid yet...
...so his body can only have been out in Haworth Mesa for a day, at most.
yeah? - So I'm searching the flight logs...
...to see which pilots were in the air hours before he was found. This is what I got.
doesn't make any sense.
Sam, Weiss's body was thrown from a plane.
whoever flew it is trying to cover their tracks. I gotta talk to the pilots.
look, they're out evac'ing camps. We're wheels up in less than 20 hours.
shit.
what happened to your hand?
I lost my glove.
look, I'm gonna go to channel six. Radio me when the pilots come back.
take care of that hand, okay? - Please report any contact with...
keeping these people safe is supposed to be my job.
he's wanted for questioning in connection with recent incidents...
... and is considered dangerous.
repeat, please report any sightings of Michael Rubin to the station manager.
how long since you last slept?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, my God.
you feel that?
report to the station manager's office... - No.
now?
nothing?
I'm gonna have to amputate these fingers.
no. No way. - They're dead, Carrie.
if I don't do it now, infection will set in.
you'll lose your hand.
sorry, kid.
I'm so sorry.
how ironic. Our last days here...
...and both of our jobs get so complicated.
guess I'm your warm-up for when you get home.
you okay?
you're gonna practice back in Chicago, aren't you?
I'm just gonna go back and focus on my granddaughter.
don't see kids down here too often. You forget what they're like.
and dogs.
trees.
still, there's a few things I'll miss.
like what? The zero humidity? The color gray?
winter '06, radio-darts championship.
we spanked Norway.
Yes, we did.
two winters together, Doc.
it wasn't all bad.
it wasn't all bad.
are you okay?
you're doing great, kid.
we're halfway there.
male TECH 1: Thirty-two. Knots dropped down...
knots dropped down...
male TECH 2: Sixteen, 16...
male TECH 3: Cloud cover is now at 10, 000 feet.
operations TECH [O VER PA]: Attention, South Pole:
the storm is now approximately only 500 miles from the station.
please commence runway-clearance protocols...
... in anticipation of the transport planes arriving.
will flight crews please begin clearing off the runway?
shit. Fuck. Aah! Aah.
way in the next five hours.
not now.
attention, all personnel: - I stopped by the clinic.
doc told me.
pretty tough marshal, huh?
well, I don't know. You were pretty tough on me.
I needed to know if I could trust you.
badge didn't do it, huh?
a badge is just a badge.
what happened to you, Carrie?
why are you down here, really?
there was this case my partner and I were working.
CARRIE: Drug trafficker.
after months of work, we'd finally nailed this guy.
that was all you today.
why don't you get some sleep? You earned it.
I was feeling so good.
I woke up, and I got this bad feeling.
sorry, we woke you.
no, it's too hot to sleep.
but everything seemed fine.
Jack: You wanna take over? CARRIE: Sure, just give me a second.
CARRIE: Jack?
my first thought was for my partner. Was he hurt?
Jack: Emergency traffic, prisoner escape in progress.
he got away from us. My partner is down. Repeat...
CARRIE: Suddenly, I was in a nightmare.
you son of a bitch.
how much to let him escape?
Carrie. - To let him kill me?
how much?
hell of a lot.
okay.
I know this is bad.
but listen to me.
please.
Carrie.
I killed him.
he gave you no choice.
no.
but what I can't get away from is that...
...Jack had turned and I didn't have a clue.
and if I missed that, then maybe I just don't have it.
from what I've seen, you haven't missed a beat.
and if you've really given up on yourself...
...you would've turned your badge in a long time ago, but you haven't.
so you come down here in the worst marshal's post on the planet...
...to what?
punish yourself.
okay, well, you've done that.
but you're better than this, and I think you know that.
let me help you.
Sam [O VER RADIO]: Carrie, do you copy?
CARRIE: Yeah. - Rubin's just been spotted on the base.
where? - He just left the Science Building.
great.
tech [O VER PA]: Updated weather tracking shows...
... that this is a Category 4 storm. - I'm right behind you.
I've been informed there are personnel securing their workstations.
you have only three hours to complete all work and winterize the science station.
repeat, you have three hours. We're gonna cut it close, people, so please move it.
Rubin?
what happened out there?
I know about the plane.
rubin, it's okay.
talk to me.
we were out looking for meteor samples.
we'd found nothing for weeks.
and then, the radar went off the charts. We hit something big.
we debated what it could be.
we came back to base to report what we'd found.
that's when we heard the story about the lost Russian plane.
instead of filing the report, we went back out there.
rubin: We blasted our way through the ice and found the plane...
... with that goddamn box.
weiss: Aah! - Weiss tore up his leg getting into it.
he was losing a lot of blood.
we tried to stop the bleeding.
we were afraid to move him, so I radioed for help.
the plan was for him to call us when he got to Pole to let us know he was okay.
Mooney was right.
he said we couldn't trust him. - Trust who? Who's after you?
John: Carrie?
CARRIE: Stop him! Somebody stop him!
please, let me help you. Rubin.
rubin, open the door.
open the door. Rubin.
rubin: Help!
wait. Wait. Wait. Help!
rubin: Help me! Help me!
help me!
Carrie. It's okay, you got him. You got him.
HADEN: I've already told you. My name is Russell Haden.
I'm an Australian citizen.
and I demand to speak with my consulate.
he say anything more? - Same chorus.
for a guy who's going down for a triple homicide...
...I think you'd be interested in helping us out.
what did you find in that plane?
so, marshal.
remember the strip search you owe me?
I reckon you'd be good for it now that you're missing a couple of parts.
Pryce.
operations TECH [O VER PA]: Attention, all base personnel:
good news. A transport plane has just landed.
Hey, hey, hey! You son of a bitch. Take your fucking hands off me.
you got a foul mouth, mate. - I'm not your fucking mate, all right?
my name's Russell Haden. I'm an Australian citizen.
CARRIE: Let's see how cute you are with a few parts missing.
all right, all right, all right!
Robert: We know you flew out to 104 to help Weiss.
what did you do with the canisters, huh?
where did you hide them?
they're in my gear. I hid them in my goddamn gear.
you crazy bitch.
let's lock him up till we get him on the plane.
transport MAN: Come on! Move it, move it!
let's go, people. Get on!
Robert: All right. OPERATIONS TECH: Attention, everybody...
HADEN: Yeah, all right!
asshole. - Shut up.
storm's on our ass. We gotta get moving.
but we can't leave without those canisters.
fifteen minutes. That's all I can do. - I'll take it.
I'm gonna see if any of his bags made it to the transport.
CARRIE: Sam.
Thanks.
I'll see you on the plane.
operations TECH: All exterior doors will be locked according to winterize procedures.
once you leave, you will not be able to reenter the station.
we've got a Category 5 storm bearing down on us. Move your ass, people.
CARRIE: Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Shit.
CARRIE: Oh, God.
Delfy.
Whoa!
it's me.
I went looking for Doc. I couldn't find him.
Carrie.
CARRIE: Okay.
we need you in the Comm Center. Delfy's hurt bad.
John [O VER RADIO]: What happened? - He's been stabbed.
be right there.
Robert: What the hell's going on?
Haden's out. - What?
CARRIE: Yeah. Somehow, he escaped.
Carrie, give me some room.
Sam: Carrie, where the hell are you? Where's Doc?
he's with us. We're still inside. - You gotta leave. The base is locking down.
we can't. Haden's loose. He tried to kill Delfy.
Oh, man.
look, we're not gonna make it to the plane.
Carrie, listen to me. If we leave, you're stuck here all winter.
CARRIE: We know.
good luck. Be careful.
all right. We gotta get him to the clinic. Help me.
woman [O VER PA]: Station-wide evacuation is in effect.
repeat, station is now in emergency lockdown.
Haden's taken the keys to his plane. He's gonna try to beat the storm.
he's gone!
he's going back. He's gonna lock us out.
CARRIE: I'll check Operations. You check Building D.
Robert: Be careful.
Robert: Doc.
doc!
Oh!
Robert: What are you doing?
finding out what's inside. Don't you wanna know?
well, not if it's radioactive, no.
well, don't you think the Soviets would've put some kind of marking on it...
...if it were?
Yeah, sure. The mark would be on the cap.
but is it worth the risk?
what the?
well, unless Haden was smuggling radioactive jellybeans...
...then he has a partner.
Yeah. - Who?
he must've gotten out on that plane.
Yeah, he must have.
sour apple.
CARRIE: Sam, it must be on the transport.
Sam [O VER RADIO]: I don't know what to tell you.
we've searched everything. CARRIE: You've searched all passengers?
Yeah. We found nothing suspicious.
it must be hidden on the base.
CARRIE: Are you sure everything on the manifest...
...made it onto the plane? - No, I'm not sure. We were so rushed.
do you have the manifest? - I can get it.
Yeah, fax it to me, Sam. Do it now.
so, what did he say?
they're still going through everything. He'll call me when they're done.
you must be pretty wiped out, huh?
Yeah, I'm gonna go clean up.
CARRIE: Come on, Sam.
Carrie [SOFTLY]: Two-fifty-eight through 260, Science Building.
it's a fresh wound.
somebody must've treated him in the field. - Yeah.
and they were in a hurry.
say the word, I'll bag the body, put it on a plane to McMurdo.
let them sort it out. No big deal.
John: They're diamonds.
purest, the most valuable.
they don't look like much till they're cut.
you don't have a granddaughter.
do you?
I don't have anything.
twelve years at Northwestern, 20 years of private practice...
...and what the hell am I doing now? I'm down here treating...
...frostbite, hangover, whatever.
those diamonds were under that ice for 50 years. Who's gonna miss them?
it was my chance to take back something of what they took from me.
from you?
how about what you took from them?
from me?
we were friends.
how's the hand?
it hurts.
Yeah, it will for some time.
and even though they're gone, you're gonna feel like they're there.
I gotta turn you in, Doc.
Yeah, I know that.
I never meant for anyone to get hurt.
but Haden was too greedy.
hell, we all were.
the aurora australis is pretty special this time of year.
you haven't really watched it, have you?
no.
I'd like to see it one last time.
okay.
John: You owe it to yourself to see it sometime.
it's a hell of a show.
Yeah.
I feel a spare coming on.
I guarantee you don't split those posts. This is sad. It's embarrassing.
has he broken a hundred yet? - Watch and learn.
Oh, so sad.
I intimidate you, don't I? - Oh, yeah.
where are you going? - I gotta do the rounds.
death IN THE GARDEN - Alberto, come to eat! - Yes!
Thanks. - It's like being at home.
well, it's french cooking, but local style.
when you are hungry, everything is excellent.
I like hungry people.
that's how I learned all the secrets of cooking.
and soon ... - YES!
you'll open a restaurant in Marseilles, we know.
Yes, I'll have my own restaurant.
and not just the restaurant... - You have a lot of projects...
what do they want?
do not worry, come!
soldiers always mean trouble.
come on! Listen everybody! This concerns all of you!
Hurry! - Let's see what happens.
pursuant to the article 36 of the constitution...
all diamond mining in the Guluva Valley must stop immediately.
all diamond rights are exclusively reserved to the state ...or a natural or legal person designated by the Governor.
this decree takes effect as of tomorrow.
the miners and their equipment ...must leave today, or the tools will be confiscated.
signed by the provincial Governor Roberto Guzman.
come!
tell the others!
what does that mean ? - It means: We are kicked out.
bastards! - The state takes our claims!
No! They belong to us! The mines are ours.
they treat us like rats. - I go and talk to capt. Ferrero - Let's see, what he says. - Right, let's go.
comrades, those who want to see the captain, follow me!
it seems that they are angry - You are worried ?
focus on the game, You will not hear anything.
there'll be trouble. Quiet, lieutenant. Let me think.
my Captain, a delegation wants to see you.
how many? - At least 40.
well, I'll see them according to the regulations, Sgt.
know what I mean? - Yes, Captain.
take the necessary steps, then send them in.
Bishop beats captain.
we will have to discuss this. There is the Sgt.
quiet! Quiet!
the capt. will receive you all, but you must surrender your guns
you'll get them back as you leave. That's the rule.
what shall we do Alberto?
we won't give them our guns! - But we are here to talk.
you think we can discuss with these men?
be carefull, comrades!
alberto is right! An unarmed man carries no weight!
so let's go!
checkmate, captain.
without a doubt.
they refuse to surrender their weapons, captain.
I begin to be tired of these guys!
lt. ... Get rid of this mob!
affirmative, Captain!
we want to talk to the captain!
easy, comrades, easy!
in a row!
I want to talk to the captain.
horn!
prepare arms!
fire!
reload!
stop!
let him go. He is not a local.
listen!
any cigarettes?
you are right, it is unfair.
but what are we going to do?
we have got hardly any guns.
and if they get reinforcement, we are done.
the strong make their own justice;
the weak just shut up.
there is no other truth, we have to choose!
well said, you're right. We can't let them ruin our lives
they fired and we ran like sissies!
...because we were surprised! But this ain't over!
you understand? - Not a word!
to your health! - Go to hell!
what's up?
you're not very talkative.
leave her alone!
and who are you? - I am her father!
if you had children, you would act like me.
daddies shouldn't talk big.
let go!
old fart!
it's ok, don't worry.
did he hurt you?
old fart!
are your boots ok?
talk is useless. We must fight!
Yeah, yeah, right!
we'll take back all mines tomorrow. Come armed!
very good!
they are about 40. And we, we are more than 200.
they won't dare to attack us.
what if they do?
the strong of today, will be tomorrow's weak.
who does he think he is?
father Lizzardi, the missionary.
what's he butting in for? You are not your family!
it is my duty to warn you, you will be slaughtered!
I ain't so sure! We can't let them fleece us like sheep!
we do not fear captain Ferrero.
and then? The men of Col Sandoman are only a day's march away.
can't you see? - We'll see later.
it will be a useless massacre!
the revolt will end in ruthless repression.
father, you've been here only 2weeks, mind your own business.
go convert some Indians and get off our backs!
we are big boys now, we don't need your advice.
well, well ...
but you'll gain nothing this way.
he who lives by the sword, shall perish by the sword!
threats, eh?
enough talk, let's go.
nice boots, Maria!
what can I do for you, father? - Hello, John.
father, you are right. Fighting leads to no good.
I am amazed you're with these rebels.
you are a pacifist. You have no place in a story like that.
I am peaceful, but me and my friends are all in the same boat.
I speak not as a priest, but as a friend.
your daughter has noone but you.
and are you going to risk your life for nothing?
but, father, you know what I think ...
we should abandon this place as we can.
I agree with you. I don't like fights.
especially with the government. - You are reasonable!
yes ... I'm reasonable.
a man has to think.
goodbye, Father. - Goodbye, son.
Bye. - John!
Thanks, sen. Castin!
Ah, tell me!
is Chenco's boat due in today? - What day is today?
it'll be here tomorrow.
your watch shows the days? - Yes.
must be an expensive watch? - Sure, but It is not mine.
our order was given some.
take a look.
all our missionaries wear them. - How nice!
north Refining Company.
for the heroic missionaries of Mambuti.
magnificent!
contact me when Chenco arrives. I gotta go.
where to will Chencos boat go?
to the chicle plantations the Marquesa, before the Cumumi Rapids, near the brazilian border.
so, you let me know? - As soon as he arrives.
father Lizzardi is quite a man!
in his first mission he is sent among the wildest of the natives - He just might... - Get his head shrunk...!
big loss! How much for this lighter?
Ah! You rent rooms?
I have no free rooms, only a place in the stable with your horse.
if you want to share it with. Tonight I'd like to sleep in a bed
money'll get you anything here.
even a bed? - Even a bed! But ...
it is expensive! - Tell me where.
that's easy. Turn right as you go out
it is a house with an arch. You can't miss it.
anybody home?
what are you doing there?
what I do here?
I'm in my bed! And you?
it guess I'm in yours. - And you're not amazed?
a good bed always amazes me.
you're not very polite.
nice muscles!
Ah, the strong men always please!
but with me it is different.
I need ...
I see ...
Ah, no! Small bills are not my style.
and you see large bills often? Not as often as I'd like.
the search for diamonds stimulates the imagination.
that's why I came to rot this hole.
although I can not complain; I manage.
you don't look like this type Hey! Remember?
I am mercenary. - Oh, if it's only that...
that can be arranged.
I have got what it takes.
aren't you afraid with all that on you?
bodies are perishable.
if anyone gets too close to my fortune, he's in trouble!
you have an answer for everything.
by the way...
what is your name? - Shark.
that hits hard! - Scared?
and you?
me?
my name is Djin.
in the language of the natives it is the name of a bird.
like it?
not bad.
on your feet, fast! Follow me!
Why? - No time for explanations.
you explain first. - Sergeant!
take him away!
you'll pay for this!
take him away!
we'll see eachother again.
here, for you. - Thank you, Mr. Chenco.
take this... - Thank you...
here. - Thank you, Mr. Chenco.
you pay me back next month.
remember! Money's all that counts.
right, Mr. Chenco.
... This is a great spot for girls who know how!
the diamond miners spend plenty.
I am the opposite. I'm saving like an ant.
that's fine. You're right. Come on, get off cnow.
good luck!
Hello!
so, is this yours? - Who else's?
and the money inside is yours? Yes, mine and no one else's.
did you come via Cimaruna?
never heard of this place.
sure ... Why would you go there?
if you are a good guy.
some foreigners held up the bank in Cimaruna.
what do you say to that? - Not me!
you were seen in Cimaruna!
I never been there! - Oh, no?
bring him in!
good morning, my captain! - Good morning, senor!
do you know this man?
I've seen him around here...
was it in Cimaruna? - Ah, that's it!
he is one of the bandits that made the coup in the bank.
I saw his picture on the posters.
how much do they pay for this?
sorry, my captain.
we take him with the jeep to the police of Cimaruna.
I see: A shot in the neck and he says I tried to escape.
lock him up!
congratulations, captain. You know how to do things well.
one moment, Chenco.
we need to talk about our business.
fire!
forward!
what? - We have been ambushed,
we haven't even had the time to defend us, my lieutenant.
idiots! You have guns Use them!
who killed the corpoal? - ...him!
not me. - Put this scum in jail.
Oh, Maria!
Hey, Maria ...Listen...
come, throw it away.
my baby! There is nothing left for us to do here.
we'll return to France. France!
it's my country.
we have a little money.
even quite ...
you will be happier there.
and they will heal you!
maybe we don't go alone.
there's a lady who likes you And I like her...
... maybe she wants ...
to come with us.
you wouldn't mind??
No!
you're an angel.
you always want to please your father.
look, here she is.
isn't she pretty?
I m waiting for her response tonight.
we have to talk, Chenco. - What's wrong?
I've been thinking ...
tell your captain Ferrero I don't like the deal.
he always takes too much!
don't worry.
we need him, to us he is very useful.
that does not justify anything! ... He needs us too!
if this continues, I am about ready to quit.
come on, don't be angry. Try to relax a little more.
trust me. - Yes, of course ...
you have a face that inspires confidence.
Djin, I want to talk to you.
go! - No, not here.
there? - Okay.
forward.
well, what's on your mind? - What do you think of Castin?
he's a decent guy. - That's all?
that's not so bad, looking at the number of bastards out there
well, the decent guy wants to marry you.
what?
that's a funny one! And he sent you to tell me?
well ... I wanted to know what you think about it.
what I think? Wait!
guys, a gent's asking for my hand! What do you say?
I'm serious!
can't we laugh a little? That's a good one!
so?
look, Alberto ... You know who I am, right?
you can understand I am a little surprised.
well, that guy used to come here a lot ...
now he ain't been in for two months!
and to top it all he's always in church!
I can't understand how you two are friends.
Castin doesn't care about bourgeois prejudices.
he offers you a good, honest family.
my ideas go along the same lines.
Castin's a decent man and that means a lot.
an honest family with me?
and he is no spring chicken!
no. . is not a good deal for me.
what is it?
sorry ... Hey, I'm going for the accounts.
okay.
Ah, don't make a mistake subtracting!
Castin is 68 years old...
he has a lot of money, and wants to buy a restaurant in Marseille
this climate has worn him out.
you'd be a young widow soon.
you're sure he's loaded?
he's got more money than any of us!
tell him to come and see me tonight. For a talk.
you're a bitch! I just wanted to see what you really are.
you are worse than I imagined.
a nice guy wants to help you, and you only think of his money
you want him to die fast!
Yes, it's disgusting! - What's wrong with you?
I never said that money scares me!
nobody move!
any hidden guns? - Yes!. Here!
hands up!
get their guns!
now get the hell out!
Hey, Albert!
don't forget to tell Castin come see me tonight!
whenever you wish. - Please, Father.
how is he? - Like a guy short on blood!
my son, your buddy has tended your body as good as possible.
but I console myself in the name our Lord and his church.
great! Me with a slug in my side!
don't talk with such bitterness my son, think of your soul.
Ah, shit!
let me help you, my son.
don't consider me as an enemy.
I am a man who wants to ease your misery.
I ask only...
that you repent. Let me lead you to God.
leave me alone!
don't refuse the priest. You should listen to him.
then go and confess to him but leave me in peace.
a guy like you knows how to face a firing squad...
but, then, afterwards?
the priest could help you for that.
your buddy is right, my son.
forget your pride. God is almighty.
and it costs nothing to repent!
shut up, Curillo!
poor boy!
I can do nothing more here.
you have done everything possible thanks.
if you need me, I'll be outside. Well, father.
father!
would you do me a great favor? Sure son, if i can...
well ... It's not about me
I left my old mother in Europe when I came here to get rich.
you see the situation I am in ...
I would like to write to her.
and then I want to confess.
I take your confession, my son.
do you have paper and pen?
I'll ask the guards.
guards! Open!
get the man pen and paper
I can't. Do it, I'll take responsibilty.
well, father. - Thanks.
father, come. Has lost consciousness.
he must be dying.
don't bother.
it is a good one. - Thanks.
I want a firing squad before midnight.
execute him tonight?
and why not? He'll be an example!
I will show the mob I'm not kidding.
marking time!
forward!
platoon!
look, Alberto. - Leave me alone!
present Arms!
charge!
Aim!
no more death penalty! - Murderers!
fire!
to the left!
more distance, more, there. - Give me a rifle.
you can bring it now? - Yes.
go!
you have amno? - Make do with that.
Ah, those! It's full.
give me the revolver. - Shall I come?
no need, I know the way.
reinforcements? - Tomorrow at 8.
under orders from whom? - The Colonel Sandoman.
machine guns and infantry, 100 men.
who is it?
it's me, Castin.
let me in.
you were in the fight? - If...
you should have come here this would'nt have happened.
but I didn't do a thing!
stand Still!
to the right!
forward!
due to the bloody riots that have plagued this peaceful city caused by some mostly foreign adventurers.
we decree a state of martial law.
we know who is responsible and they will be tracked down.
two of them have already died, the other two escaped.
Castin, who invited the men to revolt, and Shark, who blew up the powder kegs.
a 5000 pesos reward is offered for them dead or alive.
if the culprits have not been found within 24 hours, 4 of their comrades, chosen at random, will be shot
signed: Colonel Sandoval, Commander of Cuchazo.
alone?
where is your father?
your dad ... where is he?
wait ... Your dad ... is gone?
it's dangerous outside. I have to talk to him.
please tell me.
your dad didn't sleep here?
why did you came here to hide?
I didn't plan things like that.
you expected an invitation?
no, but I thought... thought of you as my wife...
Ah, yes... I see...
don't say that I'm here!
who is it? - Please open the door!
I have to talk to Castin! It's urgent.
it is very serious.
well, come in.
here.
here he is!
I hesitated to come to you in such a place.
Oh, father...I can explain...
no, first listen to me!
I never believed that you'd lead such a riot.
they shot at you? Others already died!
and now they are looking for you. - Me?
but I have done nothing! - You have not done anything?
of course not! I wasn't even there!
if you're not found within 24h, 4 hostages will be shot.
the new commander has set price on your head: 5000 pesos.
5000 pesos? - It is terrible!
but I cannot do anything... - Yes, you can.
the first thing you have to do is not to stay here!
I have nothing to do with your business!
what do you advise, Father? - You ask me?
you have to turn in yourself to save their lives.
but I didn't do anything! - Innocents die because of you!
innocents? I am innocent too!
I didn't even fire a shot! I was not even armed!
Djin can tell. The testimony of this individual
what do you mean?
the colonel listens to the mili- tary. For them, you're guilty.
well, Castin, 4 innocent lives depend on you.
I told you I did nothing! I would deliver an innocent!
tell him, Djin! - First you must go.
or I'll get screwed... - But... I am innocent...
then tell them that!
well, Father... - Castin,
I'll see the colonel with you, I promise.
you'll save the hostages lives!
Castin! - Open up, Djin,
we just want to know if Castin is in your house.
you better give him to us than to the soldiers.
come on, open the door! I can open it, you'll see!
they'll turn me in!
father, do something.
think about my daughter. What can she do without me?
and I don't count? Get out! They must not find you here!
you want me to leave? How?
go to the back alley. - They'll see me. Impossible.
if they find you here, I'm done for.
come on!
take some manners! - Where is Castin?
he's not here.
come on, cut the crap! - He is not here!
and why didn't you open? - Because I was busy.
Busy?. Let's have a look!
they arrested captain Ferrero and interrogate his friends.
we gotta scram.
come to my boat tonight and we'll go together.
no sign of him!
and in there? - Nothing.
and there? - That's my room.
get out of my way!
father Lizzardi! I would have never imagined!
never would I have believed that a priest...
he's giving Djin confession!
brothers, do not judge me by appearances!
I'm not your brother! In my family we do not hide!
wait 'till the companeros find this out...
well, happy? Seen all you wanted?
we have seen plenty! - Then get the hell out.
come on! - Okay, we go!
and forgive us for having disturbed you, father.
father, I heard everything. It's terrible!
don't talk about it.
I need to meditate.
it's hard to be judged when you're not guilty.
I was really in a sweat! - What about him?
bastards!
and you wanted me to leave! I'd be torn to shreds!
I don't know what I was thinking...
but put yourself in my shoes.
if they found you in my house, I'd have been ruined.
I lost my head. You have to understand it.
but still I hid you!
I am only a woman. And I'm all alone.
well ...
not anymore.
now we are together.
let's not discuss this anymore.
besides, I got you into this mess.
I have to get you out of town. - Sure... But how?
Chenco's boat!
well? - I think he leaves tonight.
he's sailing along the Mambuti, and across the river is Brazil.
Oh, yeah?
you embark on Chenco's boat. But... you know Chenco!
he'd turn me in for the 5000 pesos!
no... I'm done for!
but you are not. - I'm going with you!
look, Djin, you saved me.
and now. you're like my wife.
Yes, and I want to prove it to you.
here, these diamonds are all our fortune!
you carry them.
I'll go get my daughter. Try to take her on the boat.
I hide in the woods till night and try to get aboard.
it's my only chance!
if I fail, promise me to take care of her as if you were her mother
OK?
agreed.
we're casting off!
when we are a bit further, I speak with Chenco.
it is a matter of money. - And Maria?
do not worry, she is here. - Ok.
you undid the bandage again.
do not move!
get going!
not a sound!
where is your boss? Do not move!
answer me? Where is your boss?
here he is! Drop the knife!
take his pistol.
he is dangerous, Chenco. Knock him out.
get out!
go get the soldiers!
5000 pesos fell out of the sky!
sorry, Father Lizzardi, but money is money!
and I want the reward.
Bravo! Start the engine. I'll take the wheel.
don't leave us like that!
we're gonna have a nice trip together!
stay here and don't move!
so we meet again!
full speed!
get down, stupid!
here's my share. Chenco has a share too.
nothing new, Lieutenant.
they are 10 hours ahead.
we must stop them before they reach brazil.
I know Chenco's boat, we are three times faster.
we will catch them before dark.
Embark!
no tricks!
if we go aground, or anything happens you're dead!
in the big bag! - There are guns too.
Castin! Here, take this.
take some amno.
throw the rest overboard. - All of it?
we can't let Chenco use it!
Castin, where are you taking me? - Whereever you want, father.
you must put me ashore so I can reach the mission St Rosalia and go to the natives.
leave them alone! They'll be better off!
at least nobody will force them to work.
thanks to the missions, many tribes have now heard the word of God.
through the voice of his opera- tors. - That's not our fault.
no, but they follow you every- where. They really love you!
I won't argue with you!
put me ashore immediately!
I'm in command here.
get that in your head and we'll get on well.
I have only one boss. You don't scare me!
we'll see.
Castin, you are wrong to aid such scum.
what else can I do? I was inno- cent, they set a price on my head!
don't you hear anything?
sounds like an engine!
are other boats around here? The Turica Bamba army launch.
in that case, we have to disembark quickly!
grab all the supplies you can. Come on!
OK, enough already! Let's go!
the boat is drifting away!
so what? - I left my suitcase on it!
you don't need it in the jungle!
the boat will sink. It's not yours to dispose of!
I did that for a living. -You'll need to earn a living.
walk!
kill him? - What's it to you?
don't kill me!
take my money. Leave you here to betray us?
I lead you, I know the jungle. You'll get lost otherwise.
you'll starve! It's true, he knows the jungle.
well ...
walk in front with him.
if he tries to run, kill him. Come on!
come on, walk!
come ...
walk!
Hey, you know the country, How far is it to the Mambuti?
I don't know. Could be 3 days. or 20. It depends on the jungle
which direction should we take?
straight to the west. No doubt about that.
west ... don't make me laugh.
and where is west, with all the detours that we made?
don't be silly! We follow the sun.
the sun? It has given you a sunstroke!
come on, honey...
we must get out of this, one way or another.
I don't have to! Nobody's after me!
I want to return to the river!
no way!
nobody's going to squeal to the soldiers.
at least no one alive, understand?
we're all together till the end.
understand?
yet we agreed yesterday. Come on!
you'll see when we are in France...
in my restaurant beachfront. - Your restaurant?
miserable fool! Old slob!
I'll never make it.
it's all your fault.
leave me alone! You make me sick!
you're old and ugly, you hear that?
and take your savings back. I'm fed up!
this woman is ruthless! - Who asked for your opinion?
but she's always underfoot!
isn't your song over yet?
and do not start again.
get some sleep. Tomorrow will be a tough day.
impossible...
get up!
I can't sleep like this. Tomorrow I'll be worthless.
if you're tired, you'll sleep. His rest is in our interest.
mine is to keep him here! - Where could he go?
I'll look after him. Tie him in front.
turn around!
what?
look!
bastard!
you see? Those bastards had planned everything.
they had supplies for weeks. - Let them starve!
I'll spoil their appetite.
show me!
how many packages did they have? - I don't know what they took!
Lt.we gotta go now,'cause maybe they have already left the cave.
take that, let's go!
lt. may I move off to the right and cut them off?
not worth it.
the river is their sole hope.
they can't come this way because of us.
they're in the jungle and will never get out.
take him away!
Maria!
now that! What happened?
you should stay close to your father!
what happened?
I twisted my ankle.
it's only a sprain. Walk or it will swell.
I can't. - Try!
and Chenco? - It's settled.
and the supplies? - Go get them if you can!
what's wrong? - I sprained my ankle.
Bravo, father! That's how to help others.
I'll pray to god to forgive you.
do not waste time, let's go. - Come on.
come...
go.
it hurts! - Walk! You'll get over it.
Hey, everybody can keep up, except you!
they've got pains too.
you said you'd bring back food. - What can I do?
it is impossible to see an animal. I shoot at random.
with a carbine! If only I had a hunting rifle.
noone can walk without eating. We've no choice - I can't go on! - If we stay here, we'll die.
maybe that is the best.
well?
there are trees everywhere, not a single clearing.
we'll never cross those high hills.
we will! We have to! - In this shape?
what's wrong with all of you? You want to die here ?
asshole! The bugs will eat you alive!
I don't care! - Castin!
what?
you still think we make it?
God has condemned us! Right, father?
let god alone. - We'll all die alike.
innocent and guilty.
hold still.
I don't want to drag a sick man with us.
we'll never escape.
God's already refused to feed us...
well, Shark, what do we do now?
we should try to find a way further south.
but we have to keep going!
as long as we've the strength to walk.
OK... - Come...
shark! Look!
it's too damp.
here ...
you'll see, it'll be good!
how's the fire? - It won't light!
here!
no wonder, if you do it like that!
hand me some twigs.
it is sure not easy.
everything's wet.
there's nothing dryer?
here, try that.
it's the same, this is rotten.
here everything is rotten.
we're lost...
...we're done for... done for!
it'll happen to the others too.
sooner or later...
Maria has done nothing.
come, sit down.
it's full of animals that move, sought to be eaten.
but we do not ever see one. - Of course!
they only come out at night. In the daytime they hide.
and we are not used to hunt for breakfast.
friends...
do you hear me?
maybe hunger has made me delirious, but I'm obsessed.
.obsessed by a story of eggs soft boiled eggs...
it happened when I was a seminarian.
I've got to tell you about it.
it was in my second year of theology.
I remember the refectory as if it was yesterday.
...we were ten per table.
the seminarian who served, was a fat boy.
he was a nice lad. He did everything correctly.
except each time we had soft boiled eggs.
4 or 5 always dissapeared.
there was no way to explain these disappearances.
until one day we caught him eating them 2 by 2...
on the way from the church to the dining hall...
I mean from the kitchen to the dining hall.
even so, he became coadjutor in my hometown.
my mother's name was Maria...
are you hurt? - Yes.
get up, I'll help you.
don't be mad at me because of the other night.
I was feeling blue.
I am not mad at you...
we are all guilty.
we all have something to reproach.
do not talk that way all the time!
you'll see, we'll have our restaurant.
no...
there will be no restaurant! There will be nothing...
come on, Castin.
no, leave me in peace!
let me, I'll go alone!
look.
it's not an old fire.
it is still gleaming.
it is hardly damp.
there must be people around.
so we're saved?
if there are people, we must catch up. They'll help us!
we do not know who they are.
maybe headhunters or savages.
or prisoners that escaped ...
why expect the worst?
maybe they are explorers... People of good will.
let's find them?
look for other traces.
we lit this fire...
since this morning, we've gone in a circle!
if we stay here, we're done for! We have to go, quickly.
Djin, you hear?
come on, make an effort.
try to convince her.
no...
hope is all that kept her on her feet.
something must be done.
I am going further.
I do not want to die here without fighting!
I'll come with you! - No.
I won't leave them alone ... with this madman.
one of us must stay.
you're right.
if I survive, I will return.
if we don't meet again... - What?
I thought you were just... - A bandit?
now, Djin our miseries are over Look!
look!
you'll see...
gone are the parasites... No more bugs of the jungle.
you must recover strength. We still have to walk a bit.
where were you?
Where'd you find all that? - You wouldn't believe me!
come, eat first, and see later.
we had lost all hope.
God has saved us miraculously.
thanks to you, Shark.
it is strange...50 people had to die to save us.
are you sure that we are saved?
that looks like a lake...
that must be lake Tocochapa, formed by the river Mombuti.
we've only one thing left to do
build a raft and float with the current.
till we find a boat.
that's not all.
we still must fullfill our duty to the dead.
come Castin... Come...
why are you looking at me like that?
I'm ugly, huh?
you don't look very good.
I wanted to thank you for everything.
you know I like you?
I like you too...
ever since the first day.
you were funny sleeping like a kid with your mouth open.
you proved it to me from the first day on.
come, let's go swimming.
what is that?
jewelry?
where did you find it?
where?
give it to me. I will put it somewhere safe.
so we can give them back later.
no, these jewels are not yours, Maria.
they belong to the poor dead.
to the dead! And their families ...
you act very badly, Maria!
you have no right to take the belongings of the dead!
take this ...
you've always liked it, huh ?
I give it to you.
take it!
well, Maria ... What happened?
what's wrong?
father Lizzardi has been mean to you?
his watch! I don't understand!
don't be sad. Look, we're saved: There is brazil!
it is about your father? Your daddy!
your dad is sick.
but do not worry, when we arrive, he will be better.
anyway, I could take his place.
like to have me as your papa?
I like you, you know?
God has cursed us...
he wants to punish the culprits. Stop talking like that, Castin.
God makes his own decisions!
so far I have been very lenient with everyone, but no more!
only God knows who he'll punish or save.
God's justice will soon be heard.
shark! - What's up?
you are beautiful! A real lady!
look!
that's a fortune! Where did you find it ?
in the lake. - 50/50!
I found the plane! - Well, that's why everything's for you!
including the girl.
I hadn't understood. You can be a good girl, if you want to.
no .
it's just that we are both alike!
we could get along together, if you want.
so, suddenly... May I?
beauty for the beautiful.
no...
...not all of a sudden...
I liked you at once, but we had a bad start.
you hated me.
I had my reasons.
walking through the jungle, I realized...
a woman...
is nothing without a man.
that's it!
decorated for a new life.
how nice it is!
we'll have problems with the priest because of this.
let's beat it! The two of us!
Yeah, right!
but we cannot leave the girl.
the girl?
don't think about the girl!
I want a man all for myself.
it never happened before. - Getting sentimental?
don't you believe me ?
don't you trust me?
sure I trust you!
I really love you, Shark.
it took me a while to see it, but it's true.
I am so happy...
...I want to cry.
it's incredible.
hide Lizzardi!
do not stay there, You'll get killed!
he'll kill us all!
stay here with her. I try to get behind him.
what for? - We must kill him!
he is a madman we have to kill him! - No, wait.
I can calm him down.
No! - I'll talk to him.
don't shoot, I want to talk to you!
you recognize me? I am Lizzardi.
see? I trust you!
Castin! In the name of God I beg you!
let me!
stay here! Don't move!
death IN THE GARDEN - Alberto, come to eat! - Yes!
Thanks. - It's like being at home.
well, it's french cooking, but local style.
when you are hungry, everything is excellent.
I like hungry people.
that's how I learned all the secrets of cooking.
and soon ... - YES!
you'll open a restaurant in Marseilles, we know.
Yes, I'll have my own restaurant.
and not just the restaurant... - You have a lot of projects...
what do they want?
do not worry, come!
soldiers always mean trouble.
come on! Listen everybody! This concerns all of you!
Hurry! - Let's see what happens.
pursuant to the article 36 of the constitution...
all diamond mining in the Guluva Valley must stop immediately.
all diamond rights are exclusively reserved to the state ...or a natural or legal person designated by the Governor.
this decree takes effect as of tomorrow.
the miners and their equipment ...must leave today, or the tools will be confiscated.
signed by the provincial Governor Roberto Guzman.
come!
tell the others!
what does that mean ? - It means: We are kicked out.
bastards! - The state takes our claims!
No! They belong to us! The mines are ours.
they treat us like rats. - I go and talk to capt. Ferrero - Let's see, what he says. - Right, let's go.
comrades, those who want to see the captain, follow me!
it seems that they are angry - You are worried ?
focus on the game, You will not hear anything.
there'll be trouble. Quiet, lieutenant. Let me think.
my Captain, a delegation wants to see you.
how many? - At least 40.
well, I'll see them according to the regulations, Sgt.
know what I mean? - Yes, Captain.
take the necessary steps, then send them in.
Bishop beats captain.
we will have to discuss this. There is the Sgt.
quiet! Quiet!
the capt. will receive you all, but you must surrender your guns
you'll get them back as you leave. That's the rule.
what shall we do Alberto?
we won't give them our guns! - But we are here to talk.
you think we can discuss with these men?
be carefull, comrades!
alberto is right! An unarmed man carries no weight!
so let's go!
checkmate, captain.
without a doubt.
they refuse to surrender their weapons, captain.
I begin to be tired of these guys!
lt. ... Get rid of this mob!
affirmative, Captain!
we want to talk to the captain!
easy, comrades, easy!
in a row!
I want to talk to the captain.
horn!
prepare arms!
fire!
reload!
stop!
let him go. He is not a local.
listen!
any cigarettes?
you are right, it is unfair.
but what are we going to do?
we have got hardly any guns.
and if they get reinforcement, we are done.
the strong make their own justice;
the weak just shut up.
there is no other truth, we have to choose!
well said, you're right. We can't let them ruin our lives
they fired and we ran like sissies!
...because we were surprised! But this ain't over!
you understand? - Not a word!
to your health! - Go to hell!
what's up?
you're not very talkative.
leave her alone!
and who are you? - I am her father!
if you had children, you would act like me.
daddies shouldn't talk big.
let go!
old fart!
it's ok, don't worry.
did he hurt you?
old fart!
are your boots ok?
talk is useless. We must fight!
Yeah, yeah, right!
we'll take back all mines tomorrow. Come armed!
very good!
they are about 40. And we, we are more than 200.
they won't dare to attack us.
what if they do?
the strong of today, will be tomorrow's weak.
who does he think he is?
father Lizzardi, the missionary.
what's he butting in for? You are not your family!
it is my duty to warn you, you will be slaughtered!
I ain't so sure! We can't let them fleece us like sheep!
we do not fear captain Ferrero.
and then? The men of Col Sandoman are only a day's march away.
can't you see? - We'll see later.
it will be a useless massacre!
the revolt will end in ruthless repression.
father, you've been here only 2weeks, mind your own business.
go convert some Indians and get off our backs!
we are big boys now, we don't need your advice.
well, well ...
but you'll gain nothing this way.
he who lives by the sword, shall perish by the sword!
threats, eh?
enough talk, let's go.
nice boots, Maria!
what can I do for you, father? - Hello, John.
father, you are right. Fighting leads to no good.
I am amazed you're with these rebels.
you are a pacifist. You have no place in a story like that.
I am peaceful, but me and my friends are all in the same boat.
I speak not as a priest, but as a friend.
your daughter has noone but you.
and are you going to risk your life for nothing?
but, father, you know what I think ...
we should abandon this place as we can.
I agree with you. I don't like fights.
especially with the government. - You are reasonable!
yes ... I'm reasonable.
a man has to think.
goodbye, Father. - Goodbye, son.
Bye. - John!
Thanks, sen. Castin!
Ah, tell me!
is Chenco's boat due in today? - What day is today?
it'll be here tomorrow.
your watch shows the days? - Yes.
must be an expensive watch? - Sure, but It is not mine.
our order was given some.
take a look.
all our missionaries wear them. - How nice!
north Refining Company.
for the heroic missionaries of Mambuti.
magnificent!
contact me when Chenco arrives. I gotta go.
where to will Chencos boat go?
to the chicle plantations the Marquesa, before the Cumumi Rapids, near the brazilian border.
so, you let me know? - As soon as he arrives.
father Lizzardi is quite a man!
in his first mission he is sent among the wildest of the natives - He just might... - Get his head shrunk...!
big loss! How much for this lighter?
Ah! You rent rooms?
I have no free rooms, only a place in the stable with your horse.
if you want to share it with. Tonight I'd like to sleep in a bed
money'll get you anything here.
even a bed? - Even a bed! But ...
it is expensive! - Tell me where.
that's easy. Turn right as you go out
it is a house with an arch. You can't miss it.
anybody home?
what are you doing there?
what I do here?
I'm in my bed! And you?
it guess I'm in yours. - And you're not amazed?
a good bed always amazes me.
you're not very polite.
nice muscles!
Ah, the strong men always please!
but with me it is different.
I need ...
I see ...
Ah, no! Small bills are not my style.
and you see large bills often? Not as often as I'd like.
the search for diamonds stimulates the imagination.
that's why I came to rot this hole.
although I can not complain; I manage.
you don't look like this type Hey! Remember?
I am mercenary. - Oh, if it's only that...
that can be arranged.
I have got what it takes.
aren't you afraid with all that on you?
bodies are perishable.
if anyone gets too close to my fortune, he's in trouble!
you have an answer for everything.
by the way...
what is your name? - Shark.
that hits hard! - Scared?
and you?
me?
my name is Djin.
in the language of the natives it is the name of a bird.
like it?
not bad.
on your feet, fast! Follow me!
Why? - No time for explanations.
you explain first. - Sergeant!
take him away!
you'll pay for this!
take him away!
we'll see eachother again.
here, for you. - Thank you, Mr. Chenco.
take this... - Thank you...
here. - Thank you, Mr. Chenco.
you pay me back next month.
remember! Money's all that counts.
right, Mr. Chenco.
... This is a great spot for girls who know how!
the diamond miners spend plenty.
I am the opposite. I'm saving like an ant.
that's fine. You're right. Come on, get off cnow.
good luck!
Hello!
so, is this yours? - Who else's?
and the money inside is yours? Yes, mine and no one else's.
did you come via Cimaruna?
never heard of this place.
sure ... Why would you go there?
if you are a good guy.
some foreigners held up the bank in Cimaruna.
what do you say to that? - Not me!
you were seen in Cimaruna!
I never been there! - Oh, no?
bring him in!
good morning, my captain! - Good morning, senor!
do you know this man?
I've seen him around here...
was it in Cimaruna? - Ah, that's it!
he is one of the bandits that made the coup in the bank.
I saw his picture on the posters.
how much do they pay for this?
sorry, my captain.
we take him with the jeep to the police of Cimaruna.
I see: A shot in the neck and he says I tried to escape.
lock him up!
congratulations, captain. You know how to do things well.
one moment, Chenco.
we need to talk about our business.
fire!
forward!
what? - We have been ambushed,
we haven't even had the time to defend us, my lieutenant.
idiots! You have guns Use them!
who killed the corpoal? - ...him!
not me. - Put this scum in jail.
Oh, Maria!
Hey, Maria ...Listen...
come, throw it away.
my baby! There is nothing left for us to do here.
we'll return to France. France!
it's my country.
we have a little money.
even quite ...
you will be happier there.
and they will heal you!
maybe we don't go alone.
there's a lady who likes you And I like her...
... maybe she wants ...
to come with us.
you wouldn't mind??
No!
you're an angel.
you always want to please your father.
look, here she is.
isn't she pretty?
I m waiting for her response tonight.
we have to talk, Chenco. - What's wrong?
I've been thinking ...
tell your captain Ferrero I don't like the deal.
he always takes too much!
don't worry.
we need him, to us he is very useful.
that does not justify anything! ... He needs us too!
if this continues, I am about ready to quit.
come on, don't be angry. Try to relax a little more.
trust me. - Yes, of course ...
you have a face that inspires confidence.
Djin, I want to talk to you.
go! - No, not here.
there? - Okay.
forward.
well, what's on your mind? - What do you think of Castin?
he's a decent guy. - That's all?
that's not so bad, looking at the number of bastards out there
well, the decent guy wants to marry you.
what?
that's a funny one! And he sent you to tell me?
well ... I wanted to know what you think about it.
what I think? Wait!
guys, a gent's asking for my hand! What do you say?
I'm serious!
can't we laugh a little? That's a good one!
so?
look, Alberto ... You know who I am, right?
you can understand I am a little surprised.
well, that guy used to come here a lot ...
now he ain't been in for two months!
and to top it all he's always in church!
I can't understand how you two are friends.
Castin doesn't care about bourgeois prejudices.
he offers you a good, honest family.
my ideas go along the same lines.
Castin's a decent man and that means a lot.
an honest family with me?
and he is no spring chicken!
no. . is not a good deal for me.
what is it?
sorry ... Hey, I'm going for the accounts.
okay.
Ah, don't make a mistake subtracting!
Castin is 68 years old...
he has a lot of money, and wants to buy a restaurant in Marseille
this climate has worn him out.
you'd be a young widow soon.
you're sure he's loaded?
he's got more money than any of us!
tell him to come and see me tonight. For a talk.
you're a bitch! I just wanted to see what you really are.
you are worse than I imagined.
a nice guy wants to help you, and you only think of his money
you want him to die fast!
Yes, it's disgusting! - What's wrong with you?
I never said that money scares me!
nobody move!
any hidden guns? - Yes!. Here!
hands up!
get their guns!
now get the hell out!
Hey, Albert!
don't forget to tell Castin come see me tonight!
whenever you wish. - Please, Father.
how is he? - Like a guy short on blood!
my son, your buddy has tended your body as good as possible.
but I console myself in the name our Lord and his church.
great! Me with a slug in my side!
don't talk with such bitterness my son, think of your soul.
Ah, shit!
let me help you, my son.
don't consider me as an enemy.
I am a man who wants to ease your misery.
I ask only...
that you repent. Let me lead you to God.
leave me alone!
don't refuse the priest. You should listen to him.
then go and confess to him but leave me in peace.
a guy like you knows how to face a firing squad...
but, then, afterwards?
the priest could help you for that.
your buddy is right, my son.
forget your pride. God is almighty.
and it costs nothing to repent!
shut up, Curillo!
poor boy!
I can do nothing more here.
you have done everything possible thanks.
if you need me, I'll be outside. Well, father.
father!
would you do me a great favor? Sure son, if i can...
well ... It's not about me
I left my old mother in Europe when I came here to get rich.
you see the situation I am in ...

but I didn't do a thing!
stand Still!
to the right!
forward!
due to the bloody riots that have plagued this peaceful city caused by some mostly foreign adventurers.
we decree a state of martial law.
we know who is responsible and they will be tracked down.
two of them have already died, the other two escaped.
Castin, who invited the men to revolt, and Shark, who blew up the powder kegs.
a 5000 pesos reward is offered for them dead or alive.
if the culprits have not been found within 24 hours, 4 of their comrades, chosen at random, will be shot
signed: Colonel Sandoval, Commander of Cuchazo.
alone?
where is your father?
your dad ... where is he?
wait ... Your dad ... is gone?
it's dangerous outside. I have to talk to him.
please tell me.
your dad didn't sleep here?
why did you came here to hide?
I didn't plan things like that.
you expected an invitation?
no, but I thought... thought of you as my wife...
Ah, yes... I see...
don't say that I'm here!
who is it? - Please open the door!
I have to talk to Castin! It's urgent.
it is very serious.
well, come in.
here.
here he is!
I hesitated to come to you in such a place.
Oh, father...I can explain...
no, first listen to me!
I never believed that you'd lead such a riot.
they shot at you? Others already died!
and now they are looking for you. - Me?
but I have done nothing! - You have not done anything?
of course not! I wasn't even there!
if you're not found within 24h, 4 hostages will be shot.
the new commander has set price on your head: 5000 pesos.
5000 pesos? - It is terrible!
but I cannot do anything... - Yes, you can.
the first thing you have to do is not to stay here!
I have nothing to do with your business!
what do you advise, Father? - You ask me?
you have to turn in yourself to save their lives.
but I didn't do anything! - Innocents die because of you!
innocents? I am innocent too!
I didn't even fire a shot! I was not even armed!
Djin can tell. The testimony of this individual
what do you mean?
the colonel listens to the mili- tary. For them, you're guilty.
well, Castin, 4 innocent lives depend on you.
I told you I did nothing! I would deliver an innocent!
tell him, Djin! - First you must go.
or I'll get screwed... - But... I am innocent...
then tell them that!
well, Father... - Castin,
I'll see the colonel with you, I promise.
you'll save the hostages lives!
Castin! - Open up, Djin,
we just want to know if Castin is in your house.
you better give him to us than to the soldiers.
come on, open the door! I can open it, you'll see!
they'll turn me in!
father, do something.
think about my daughter. What can she do without me?
and I don't count? Get out! They must not find you here!
you want me to leave? How?
go to the back alley. - They'll see me. Impossible.
if they find you here, I'm done for.
come on!
take some manners! - Where is Castin?
he's not here.
come on, cut the crap! - He is not here!
and why didn't you open? - Because I was busy.
Busy?. Let's have a look!
they arrested captain Ferrero and interrogate his friends.
we gotta scram.
come to my boat tonight and we'll go together.
no sign of him!
and in there? - Nothing.
and there? - That's my room.
get out of my way!
father Lizzardi! I would have never imagined!
never would I have believed that a priest...
he's giving Djin confession!
brothers, do not judge me by appearances!
I'm not your brother! In my family we do not hide!
wait 'till the companeros find this out...
well, happy? Seen all you wanted?
we have seen plenty! - Then get the hell out.
come on! - Okay, we go!
and forgive us for having disturbed you, father.
father, I heard everything. It's terrible!
don't talk about it.
I need to meditate.
it's hard to be judged when you're not guilty.
I was really in a sweat! - What about him?
bastards!
and you wanted me to leave! I'd be torn to shreds!
I don't know what I was thinking...
but put yourself in my shoes.
if they found you in my house, I'd have been ruined.
I lost my head. You have to understand it.
but still I hid you!
I am only a woman. And I'm all alone.
well ...
not anymore.
now we are together.
let's not discuss this anymore.
besides, I got you into this mess.
I have to get you out of town. - Sure... But how?
Chenco's boat!
well? - I think he leaves tonight.
he's sailing along the Mambuti, and across the river is Brazil.
Oh, yeah?
you embark on Chenco's boat. But... you know Chenco!
he'd turn me in for the 5000 pesos!
no... I'm done for!
but you are not. - I'm going with you!
look, Djin, you saved me.
and now. you're like my wife.
Yes, and I want to prove it to you.
here, these diamonds are all our fortune!
you carry them.
I'll go get my daughter. Try to take her on the boat.
I hide in the woods till night and try to get aboard.
it's my only chance!
if I fail, promise me to take care of her as if you were her mother
OK?
agreed.
we're casting off!
when we are a bit further, I speak with Chenco.
it is a matter of money. - And Maria?
do not worry, she is here. - Ok.
you undid the bandage again.
do not move!
get going!
not a sound!
where is your boss? Do not move!
answer me? Where is your boss?
here he is! Drop the knife!
take his pistol.
he is dangerous, Chenco. Knock him out.
get out!
go get the soldiers!
5000 pesos fell out of the sky!
sorry, Father Lizzardi, but money is money!
and I want the reward.
Bravo! Start the engine. I'll take the wheel.
don't leave us like that!
we're gonna have a nice trip together!
stay here and don't move!
so we meet again!
full speed!
get down, stupid!
here's my share. Chenco has a share too.
nothing new, Lieutenant.
they are 10 hours ahead.
we must stop them before they reach brazil.
I know Chenco's boat, we are three times faster.
we will catch them before dark.
Embark!
no tricks!
if we go aground, or anything happens you're dead!
in the big bag! - There are guns too.
Castin! Here, take this.
take some amno.
throw the rest overboard. - All of it?
we can't let Chenco use it!
Castin, where are you taking me? - Whereever you want, father.
you must put me ashore so I can reach the mission St Rosalia and go to the natives.
leave them alone! They'll be better off!
at least nobody will force them to work.
thanks to the missions, many tribes have now heard the word of God.
through the voice of his opera- tors. - That's not our fault.
no, but they follow you every- where. They really love you!
I won't argue with you!
put me ashore immediately!
I'm in command here.
get that in your head and we'll get on well.
I have only one boss. You don't scare me!
we'll see.
Castin, you are wrong to aid such scum.
what else can I do? I was inno- cent, they set a price on my head!
don't you hear anything?
sounds like an engine!
are other boats around here? The Turica Bamba army launch.
in that case, we have to disembark quickly!
grab all the supplies you can. Come on!
OK, enough already! Let's go!
the boat is drifting away!
so what? - I left my suitcase on it!
you don't need it in the jungle!
the boat will sink. It's not yours to dispose of!
I did that for a living. -You'll need to earn a living.
walk!
kill him? - What's it to you?
don't kill me!
take my money. Leave you here to betray us?
I lead you, I know the jungle. You'll get lost otherwise.
you'll starve! It's true, he knows the jungle.
well ...
walk in front with him.
if he tries to run, kill him. Come on!
come on, walk!
come ...
walk!
Hey, you know the country, How far is it to the Mambuti?
I don't know. Could be 3 days. or 20. It depends on the jungle
which direction should we take?
straight to the west. No doubt about that.
west ... don't make me laugh.
and where is west, with all the detours that we made?
don't be silly! We follow the sun.
the sun? It has given you a sunstroke!
come on, honey...
we must get out of this, one way or another.
I don't have to! Nobody's after me!
I want to return to the river!
no way!
nobody's going to squeal to the soldiers.
at least no one alive, understand?
we're all together till the end.
understand?
yet we agreed yesterday. Come on!
you'll see when we are in France...
in my restaurant beachfront. - Your restaurant?
miserable fool! Old slob!
I'll never make it.
it's all your fault.
leave me alone! You make me sick!
you're old and ugly, you hear that?
and take your savings back. I'm fed up!
this woman is ruthless! - Who asked for your opinion?
but she's always underfoot!
isn't your song over yet?
and do not start again.
get some sleep. Tomorrow will be a tough day.
impossible...
get up!
I can't sleep like this. Tomorrow I'll be worthless.
if you're tired, you'll sleep. His rest is in our interest.
mine is to keep him here! - Where could he go?
I'll look after him. Tie him in front.
turn around!
what?
look!
bastard!
you see? Those bastards had planned everything.
they had supplies for weeks. - Let them starve!
I'll spoil their appetite.
show me!
how many packages did they have? - I don't know what they took!
Lt.we gotta go now,'cause maybe they have already left the cave.
take that, let's go!
lt. may I move off to the right and cut them off?
not worth it.
the river is their sole hope.
they can't come this way because of us.
they're in the jungle and will never get out.
take him away!
Maria!
now that! What happened?
you should stay close to your father!
what happened?
I twisted my ankle.
it's only a sprain. Walk or it will swell.
I can't. - Try!
and Chenco? - It's settled.
and the supplies? - Go get them if you can!
what's wrong? - I sprained my ankle.
Bravo, father! That's how to help others.
I'll pray to god to forgive you.
do not waste time, let's go. - Come on.
come...
go.
it hurts! - Walk! You'll get over it.
Hey, everybody can keep up, except you!
they've got pains too.
you said you'd bring back food. - What can I do?
it is impossible to see an animal. I shoot at random.
with a carbine! If only I had a hunting rifle.
noone can walk without eating. We've no choice - I can't go on! - If we stay here, we'll die.
maybe that is the best.
well?
there are trees everywhere, not a single clearing.
we'll never cross those high hills.
we will! We have to! - In this shape?
what's wrong with all of you? You want to die here ?
asshole! The bugs will eat you alive!
I don't care! - Castin!
what?
you still think we make it?
God has condemned us! Right, father?
let god alone. - We'll all die alike.
innocent and guilty.
hold still.
I don't want to drag a sick man with us.
we'll never escape.
God's already refused to feed us...
well, Shark, what do we do now?
we should try to find a way further south.
but we have to keep going!
as long as we've the strength to walk.
OK... - Come...
shark! Look!
it's too damp.
here ...
you'll see, it'll be good!
how's the fire? - It won't light!
here!
no wonder, if you do it like that!
hand me some twigs.
it is sure not easy.
everything's wet.
there's nothing dryer?
here, try that.
it's the same, this is rotten.
here everything is rotten.
we're lost...
...we're done for... done for!
it'll happen to the others too.
sooner or later...
Maria has done nothing.
come, sit down.
it's full of animals that move, sought to be eaten.
but we do not ever see one. - Of course!
they only come out at night. In the daytime they hide.
and we are not used to hunt for breakfast.
friends...
do you hear me?
maybe hunger has made me delirious, but I'm obsessed.
.obsessed by a story of eggs soft boiled eggs...
it happened when I was a seminarian.
I've got to tell you about it.
it was in my second year of theology.
I remember the refectory as if it was yesterday.
...we were ten per table.
the seminarian who served, was a fat boy.
he was a nice lad. He did everything correctly.
except each time we had soft boiled eggs.
4 or 5 always dissapeared.
there was no way to explain these disappearances.
until one day we caught him eating them 2 by 2...
on the way from the church to the dining hall...
I mean from the kitchen to the dining hall.
even so, he became coadjutor in my hometown.
my mother's name was Maria...
are you hurt? - Yes.
get up, I'll help you.
don't be mad at me because of the other night.
I was feeling blue.
I am not mad at you...
we are all guilty.
we all have something to reproach.
do not talk that way all the time!
you'll see, we'll have our restaurant.
no...
there will be no restaurant! There will be nothing...
come on, Castin.
no, leave me in peace!
let me, I'll go alone!
look.
it's not an old fire.
it is still gleaming.
it is hardly damp.
there must be people around.
so we're saved?
if there are people, we must catch up. They'll help us!
we do not know who they are.
maybe headhunters or savages.
or prisoners that escaped ...
why expect the worst?
maybe they are explorers... People of good will.
let's find them?
look for other traces.
we lit this fire...
since this morning, we've gone in a circle!
if we stay here, we're done for! We have to go, quickly.
Djin, you hear?
come on, make an effort.
try to convince her.
no...
hope is all that kept her on her feet.
something must be done.
I am going further.
I do not want to die here without fighting!
I'll come with you! - No.
I won't leave them alone ... with this madman.
one of us must stay.
you're right.
if I survive, I will return.
if we don't meet again... - What?
I thought you were just... - A bandit?
now, Djin our miseries are over Look!
look!
you'll see...
gone are the parasites... No more bugs of the jungle.
you must recover strength. We still have to walk a bit.
where were you?
Where'd you find all that? - You wouldn't believe me!
come, eat first, and see later.
we had lost all hope.
God has saved us miraculously.
thanks to you, Shark.
it is strange...50 people had to die to save us.
are you sure that we are saved?
that looks like a lake...
that must be lake Tocochapa, formed by the river Mombuti.
we've only one thing left to do
build a raft and float with the current.
till we find a boat.
that's not all.
we still must fullfill our duty to the dead.
come Castin... Come...
why are you looking at me like that?
I'm ugly, huh?
you don't look very good.
I wanted to thank you for everything.
you know I like you?
I like you too...
ever since the first day.
you were funny sleeping like a kid with your mouth open.
you proved it to me from the first day on.
come, let's go swimming.
what is that?
jewelry?
where did you find it?
where?
give it to me. I will put it somewhere safe.
so we can give them back later.
no, these jewels are not yours, Maria.
they belong to the poor dead.
to the dead! And their families ...
you act very badly, Maria!
you have no right to take the belongings of the dead!
take this ...
you've always liked it, huh ?
I give it to you.
take it!
well, Maria ... What happened?
what's wrong?
father Lizzardi has been mean to you?
his watch! I don't understand!
don't be sad. Look, we're saved: There is brazil!
it is about your father? Your daddy!
your dad is sick.
but do not worry, when we arrive, he will be better.
anyway, I could take his place.
like to have me as your papa?
I like you, you know?
God has cursed us...
he wants to punish the culprits. Stop talking like that, Castin.
God makes his own decisions!
so far I have been very lenient with everyone, but no more!
only God knows who he'll punish or save.
God's justice will soon be heard.
shark! - What's up?
you are beautiful! A real lady!
look!
that's a fortune! Where did you find it ?
in the lake. - 50/50!
I found the plane! - Well, that's why everything's for you!
including the girl.
I hadn't understood. You can be a good girl, if you want to.
no .
it's just that we are both alike!
we could get along together, if you want.
so, suddenly... May I?
beauty for the beautiful.
no...
...not all of a sudden...
I liked you at once, but we had a bad start.
you hated me.
I had my reasons.
walking through the jungle, I realized...
a woman...
is nothing without a man.
that's it!
decorated for a new life.
how nice it is!
we'll have problems with the priest because of this.
let's beat it! The two of us!
Yeah, right!
but we cannot leave the girl.
the girl?
don't think about the girl!
I want a man all for myself.
it never happened before. - Getting sentimental?
don't you believe me ?
don't you trust me?
sure I trust you!
I really love you, Shark.
it took me a while to see it, but it's true.
I am so happy...
...I want to cry.
it's incredible.
hide Lizzardi!
do not stay there, You'll get killed!
he'll kill us all!
stay here with her. I try to get behind him.
what for? - We must kill him!
he is a madman we have to kill him! - No, wait.
I can calm him down.
No! - I'll talk to him.
don't shoot, I want to talk to you!
you recognize me? I am Lizzardi.
see? I trust you!
Castin! In the name of God I beg you!
let me!
stay here! Don't move!
stay here! Don't move!
hide it, hide it. It's fresh bread. - Oh, thank you.
be careful, hide it, I don't want my father to know.
please, give me some bread. - You, be quiet!
I want some! I want some! - Quiet!
EvangeIisti! EvangeIisti!
EvangeIisti, will you sell me some cheese? - My name isn't Evangelisti, it's De Santis.
they told me you are EvangeIisti and sell cheese? - We are of the Evangelist religion.
what does that mean?
nothing, only we live by the Gospel. - What about the cheese, do you sell it?
well, no, but I can give you some, - What's wrong with that sheep? - That sheep is going to be a mother any minute now.
such a small one! - You want two?
how much for one? - 1, 000 lires each one. - Is it gold?
better, it's hard to eat gold, but cheese you can eat.
does the Gospel teach you to ask such prices? - If you don't want it...
before, I could have bought a house with this.
don't take it, Signora. If you take it at my price, you'll be mad at me, and if I sell it at your price I'll be mad at you.
gospel wants men love each other.
you're worse than all them. - Peace, little sister.
if you want a lamb for Easter, let me know. - No, you won't cheat me anymore.
good.
it's good.
good.
where could I find flour? - Who has flour.
if Rosetta gets sick, I'll get a knife then you'll see flour!
one of these days we'll go see the peasants with guns! Then we refugees will get flour.
that's the way! - If you ever do that, I will kill you!
who's talking to you? - He doesn't understand, he doesn't have children.
what are you teaching the children? - You want to teach me?
go back to your mother! - You try it and see if I don't do what I say!
I thought you'd left. - I'm leaving soon. - Where? - Down.
we haven't seen you lately. - I'll walk with you to Fondi.
are you crazy? The Germans will shoot you. - There's a friend there who might sell us food.
you mustn't risk it. - Something could happen to you.
you don't know me very well. If a German gets too close...
what's the world coming to? Horses eating grain!
Via!
they were eating grain. - Please do not be afraid. I'm not German.
you're Russian. - Russian, traitor.
you seem like Ukrainian girl. Ukrainian eyes, beautiful.
is the road safe? - You can go.
last days for Germans. For me too, I think.
he's beautiful! Is he really a Russian? - A deserter.
they never tell you that they make them like that in Russia!
can you tell me where I can buy some sugar, flour...
some tinned food, some honey, little sugar? You know, anything you can get.
if I tell you, you won't tell the Germans where I've hidden my food?
I swear I won't tell anyone.
the last time, do you know what I said? "I have nothing." And they said: "Oh, you have nothing?."
ta, ta, ta, ta, ta...
you can have this milk, if you like. I don't need it anymore. What for?
they killed Gaetanino, my baby. Who will I give it to?
you want it? Who wants milk?
who wants my milk?
hurry up, hurry up!
Michele, where did you come from? - Sant'Eufemia, everyone's all right.
this is a friend of ours, a refugee. - Please, Signora, come in.
this way.
these are old friends. This is the commander of the German anti-aircraft station.
Michele!
Cesira, a friend of the family. - Sit down. - Help yourselves.
may I ask you how it is that you managed to procure this loaf of bread?
a soldier made us a present of it and we gave him a present. You know, it's wartime...
an exchange, in other words. - That's right.
that's forbidden. Who was the soldier?
I will go and make the coffee. - I'll give you a hand.
sit down. - I'll help you, I'll help you.
Michele, eat some cake.
your occupation? - I'm a graduate.
and what did you study? - Literature.
I studied philosophy at the university of Rome.
then you can understand how we Italians can take whatever happens to us philosophically.
no, I don't. In Italy there are many things I find confusing, especially the great class distinctions.
people like you who have everything and your peasants have nothing.
this is not our usual daily meal. My mother... cooked it in your honor.
yesterday I went to look at some of your peasants... Like swine, dear sir, they all live like swine.
you don't understand, they live that way because they want to!
you! You are the leaders of Italy! It's your fault!
and please, you won't hush me with one dinner! I speak the truth.
mamma mia!
we have to stay on the right side of him. He eats here every Saturday afternoon.
I'd poison his soup!
we Germans are devoted to the truth! - Do you think you're the only ones, because you're not.
I think you Germans will be surprised when you find out the truth is not only your property.
he always drinks more than one bottle, always. - Excuse me. - Eat whatever you want.
may I take some leftovers? - Take what you want.
now what? - He always make him sing. - Could I have some sugar?
and some flour?
you... and Michele...
the coffee!
grind it for me. - Sure.
you Germans have war in their blood. - War?
war, my dear friend, is an experience without which a man cannot say he is a man.
if that's true, I would rather be castrated.
that is the way all you Italians feel, and so we are forced to waste valuable men here.
it is not true, you were beaten before you started.
Ach, instead of dreaming, put in your heads,
you and all the rest of you Italians, you will have to pay the price of your faults!
pay! Pay! You understand? And your children will have to pay with bitter tears!
what have the children got to do with it? - Tell me.
we met a woman driven crazy by you, but you won't drive me crazy! - Don't listen to her! She's only a woman.
Oh, let's get out, let's get out! - Hurry, Mama!
God help us all! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, help me! - Okay Mama, just hurry.
Cesira, come!
I can't see! I can't see!
what are you doing?
if Rosetta had seen us, we'd have made a pretty picture.
you know what? I think you're old enough to have a new hairdo.
I'd like you to do my hair like yours, Mama. - I'll try.
you're two inches taller since we are here.
I'm going into the mountains. Good-bye.
and how you'll arrive there? - I'll be all right.
take care. What are you going to do? - Something good.
so long, Rosetta. - Will we see you, in Rome?
maybe I'll send you some books anyway.
you have our address? - I'll be able to find you two, don't worry.
Hey, come and see! There are Germans in the haystack! They're retreating!
in a few days we'll leave!
you will give us something to eat.
I said you will give us something to eat! - Here nobody has anything. We are hungry ourselves.
I gave an order.
we better do something. Get him some bread, go on.
we need one of you to come with us to show us the quickest way. We have to get down to the next valley.
you - I'm not from here. I don't know these hills - He doesn't know.
you then.
anyone here can tell you that we are from Ceprano. We are just refugees.
we need water.
water, hurry up! - Somebody get some water!
hurry up!
come on, run!
you will hand me that bread! We are the mad dogs!
you come with us. - He's my son!
my son doesn't know these mountains. He reads, he is a student! He studies the Bible!
move or I'll fire.
pick me. Pick me! I know these hills.
I'll show you the fastest way over.
I'll go, Mama. I'll go.
come on, let's go! There's a long way to go.
you are an old man, I want the young one. It's a duty.
don't worry about me, I'll be back before tonight.
Bye, Mama. I'll be back.
my son! Michelino!
he'll come back, don't worry.
forward.
the Americans are coming! Look the Americans! - Michele understood the situation so he cut back through the valley. He's waiting in Fondi.
I'm sure. - But Michele was supposed to come back here.
michele knew what would happen. When the American army broke through, he knew we would all leave.
and he would be right, everybody is leaving.
come on, FiIippo. - I'll put your things on a mule.
let's go together and see what happened to Michele. - Signora, in a few days you'll be in Rome.
Paride, come here! Luisa wants you! - I'll be right back.
stay here with your wife, we'll be all right. - It always takes her all day to have a baby.
some are born, and some die.
michele has a head on his shoulders. He won't be fooled by those Germans!
come on, let's go.
everything is over! Everything is over!
I still don't know whether the shelling is American or German.
the Germans are on the run. If the Allies keep this up, soon they chase them up to Milan.
can we go back to Rome? - A matter of hours. - It'll take longer than that.
don't they have to liberate us? Look! The Americans!
Ehi, Signorina! Signorina!
Signora Cesira. - What does he want?
he asked you to show your legs. Because he wants to take your picture. - Ask your sister!
I'm sorry, she won't.
we can't get to Fondi. They're all bombing all along the road.
we have to wait until the Americans have gone through.
we are from the next village, just a short way down the road. - God be with you.
may the Virgin protect you.
mama, what can we do? - FiIippo, I want to know about my boy. Let's go- Yes, you're right.
Paride, I think we have got to go to Fondi. Michele might be waiting.
mama, come on! - My angel, it's a mess!
this is no time to go to Fondi. I'm going back to Sant'Eufemia. - Not for me, no!
we left too soon. - Let's go.
good bye. - Good luck.
wait, be careful, Maria.
take my arm.
let me know about Michele! - They're all out of their minds. They'll be right in the middle of the bombing!
good-bye, Signora. - Good-bye.
Bye, Rosetta. - Good-bye.
Signora, come with us. - No, no, good-bye.
come on, let's go! Look at the crazy girl!
what's Michele to you? Father, brother, what? Come one or I'll smack you!
are you coming or not? Rose!
hurry up, Rosetta! I want to go back to Rome, understand?
run!
damn you!
let's go.
you won't get back to Rome?
want to eat something?
Yes.
here.
I wonder who they are. - They're Allies, Mama.
come, let's find some shade.
Oh, my legs!
feel like taking a little nap? - Yes.
all right, lay down.
want this off? - No, no.
Rosetta.
Rosetta. - What? - Did you see? We'd better out of here!
Rosetta!
run, Rosetta, run!
Rosetta!
mama!
Rosetta!
mamma!
Rosetta.
sweet angel.
do you think you can walk? - Yes.
Rosetta.
Rosetta.
do you know what they have done those "heroes" that you command?
do you know what your great soldiers have done in a holy church under the eyes of the madonna? Do you know?
peace, peace.
Yes, peace, beautiful peace! You ruined my little daughter forever!
now she's worse than dead. No, I'm not mad, I'm not mad!
look at her! And tell me if I am mad!
rotten crazy bastards!
Rosetta.
Rosetta!
Rosetta!
Rosetta.
wait, let me help you.
are you in pain, my daughter? - No.
baby, please speak to me. - What is there to say?
you seem angry with me, sweet angel. You must be strong.
tomorrow we'll be in our house, I'm sure of it.
we'll find a place to sleep and leave tomorrow.
what's the use? - What's the use? You'll drive me mad.
we've been through terrible things together. This will pass. - Mama, don't talk about it anymore.
come on, sweet angel. We left our things up on the road. Someone might steal them.
come.
come, my angel come.
why don't you lean on me? Come on, Rose.
you had nothing to do with those Moroccans? - I told you no.
at Vallecorsa this morning they raped half the village.
if they touched my sister, I would killed them all.
where will you drop us? - After Fondi.
if you want to stop at any place my mother has an extra bed. - We are on our way to Rome.
it's too dangerous. Wait a few days, let the Americans go first.
you like to dance?
to dance!
well, then, what about the girl?
you...you like to dance? - Leave her alone, she's not even 13!
what's the difference? My regular girl's only 15. Girls grow up quick around here.
tonight we're going to throw a little victory party. - Tonight we have to get some sleep.
who wants to sleep? I want to enjoy myself.
don't you like to sing, kid?
Yes. -Then come on, let's sing!
that's it, beautiful, sing!
Rosetta?
Rosetta!
the dress!
Rosetta.
Rosetta!
what's the matter, Signora? - Signora, what is it?
she might have gone to Fondi to look for Michele.
out all alone like this at night! She must have gone to Fondi!
how far? How far is it from here to Fondi? - I'll take you there, Signora. It will only take us half an hour.
but why, why didn't she tell me?
all right let's go to Fondi, to FiIippo's grocery, Michele's father. - I'll just go get my shoes on.
they killed FiIippo's son.
they found him up in the hills tonight.
Michele.
sure it was Michele?
that's right. A friend of mine saw the Germans shoot him.
his mother is dying of sorrow!
Signora, your daughter she's out with my son, my FIorindo.
where? - Not far, they went dancing. - Where are they? - Not far, I told you!
what kind of a pig is your son? She's only a little girl, I'm going to kill your rotten son!
if she went out with him, she wanted too. No one forced her.
what's happened to her, God.
what have I done wrong? Tell me what I have done wrong...
she'll come back. Go to bed.
why didn't you tell me what you were going to do? - You were asleep.
you two arranged this before last night - Yes.
who gave you these? - FIorindo.
and what for? - To wear.
to wear? - Sure.
don't you ever say "sure" to me like that!
do you hear? You will not put those stockings on! You will not put them on!
you will not! Now I'm going to smack his face, that dirty pig!
she doesn't even cry...
too stupid.
he was right, Michele.
escape, escape...
but you can escape from this...
you haven't even asked about Michele.
he's dead. Michele!
mamma.
angel...
sweet angel.
forgive me.
please forgive me.
stop it, Rosetta, please.
come here, Rose. Come, sweet angel.
please stop crying, please.
please, Rosetta, please...
please, Rosetta.
my sweet angel.
sleep.
my angel, my angel.
sleep.
sleep.
sleep.
bombs! - They're bombing us!
Rosetta!
Rosetta! Rosetta!
Oh, my God, she's going to die! Arnaldo, get me some water.
will you get me a glass of water!
Rosetta!
Signora...
please, Rosetta. Try to drink some water.
it's all over, they are gone. We'll be all right. Look at me, look at Mamma.
they are gone, drink. Please, drink.
mamma! - Rosetta!
you see, Mamma was right, they are really gone. Please don't cry, my darling.
we've got to close the shop and get out of Rome. But don't cry.
it's all over. They're gone.
if I was a man, I would shoot them all! They're dirty murderers!
want me to open up? - Sure, sure!
I can't. It's all out of shape. - It's all over, Rosetta. You can thank the good Lord
Madonna, look at the smoke! That's my house!
Arnaldo, what's happened? They hit one of the houses down the street.
a lot of smoke from the Tiburtino! Here the ledge over the door came down.
"his Imperial Majesty has arranged to give the governor of Rome a relief fund of one million lire."
who, the Pope? - Of course not.
"his Imperial Majesty arranged to give the governor of Rome ..."
"all the people Count," Sforza said yesterday in his timely speech have welcomed with dignity and
his Holiness, Pope Pius XII has sent a telegram to President Roosevelt...
Giovanni, you've got to help me out.
I want my daughter out of Rome. - It's all right, sit down.
she has a weak heart, I'm afraid she might have an attack.
you'll go where? - Away from Rome!
those lunatics will come again, even the Pope they don't respect.
fine! Then the war will be over sooner, maybe. - Oh, are you crazy or something? We'll all be killed!
what's Mussolini doing? - That's what I'd like to know, that madman!
he's got to say something. - You women will believe anything.
before they came to bomb us, we weren't doing so badly. Business was good.
Oh! Sure, it was. - I'll leave you the keys to the store.
you might look in now and then and check the house, too.
if you trust me... - Sure.
we'll make up an inventory, just between friends.
Buonanni will buy the stuff that might go bad. - I'm sorry you're going.
why don't you get away? - What will I use for money, Cesira?
it would only be for a few weeks, no more. Isn't it? - Sure.
take this to Covelli. Come back in an hour. - Why an hour? - An hour.
if something had happened to Rosetta I would have murdered someone.
