recap day 1 world games 2008.
recapitalising banks and financing a euro-wide deposit-guarantee scheme might cost 300 billion-400 billion, perhaps a third of it paid for by germany.
recapitalising banks made sense during the banking crisis of 2008 when governments had debt burdens significantly lower than they are today.
recapitalising the banks will not be popular and does not solve the root problem of sovereign indebtedness.
recapitalizing the banks by the central government will slow growth in the world's second-largest economy, says vincent chan, head of china research at credit suisse in hong kong.

but that approach is far too woolly for the gateses and their philanthropic partner since last summer, warren buffett.
but that approach often does not offer much insight as to why a particular film or restaurant is being recommended, said john riedl, a professor of computer science at the university of minnesota.
but that approach raises another, thornier question: whether governments should just force banks to invest more of their own money in cyber-security, or whether they should devote their own resources to protecting banks from attacks by enemy states and their surrogates?
but that aren't enough.
that we act like gentlemen for the rest of the way.

recapturing democracy: neoliberalization and the struggle for alternative urban futures.
but that argument has yet to slow the quest for higher-tech treatments, and this race is far from over.

recapturing for his party key States...
recapturing the past is a tricky business. While most memories are simply souvenirs of a happier time, others can be quite deadly.
recast in this way, it could better solve seemingly unsolvable problems. And still succeed in creating a sense of place.
recast resplendence with struggle and faith--on the dike people who struggle in adversity.
recasting any one of these alone would be huge. Doing all four at once-when the world has never been more interconnected-is mind-boggling.
