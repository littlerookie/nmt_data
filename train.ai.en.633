with a height of 55 meters (180 feet),the Wanbu Huayanjing Pagoda is a seven-tier octagonal brick and wood structure. In order to survive earthquakes,many wooden stakes were wedged in the walls to reinforce the structure. Each story of the pagoda consists of the exterior wall,the interior wall and the cloister between them. A spiral staircase connects the stories together and leads to the top of the pagoda. Bronze mirrors are embedded under the eaves of each side of the pagoda. Wind bells hang on the ceiling of the corner of each story and on the rafter of the seventh tier .Approaching the pagoda,tourists can see the bronze mirrors gleaming under the sun and hear the euphonious sound of the wind bells.
