chinalco and its listed subsidiary chalco have already been more ambitious than most chinese groups in making foreign acquisitions.
chinalco and rio have already been in talks over possible joint ventures.
chinalco contends this is a misunderstanding of china's state-owned enterprises, which operate independently.
chinalco faced similar political pushback in australia.
chinalco famously made a dawn raid on rio tinto shares in 2008, spending$ 14bn in a joint exercise with alcoa to block takeover efforts by bhp.
chinalco has permission from the australian government to raise its stake in either rio's london-listed or australian-listed shares, or the whole group, to no more than 14.9 per cent.
chinalco has ties to chinese infrastructure contractors that could be key to developing the southern simandou block or more.
chinalco is also seeking two seats on rio's board.
chinalco is also understood to be sticking with its demand to have two rio board seats but is prepared to offer concessions on marketing provisions, proposed "off-take" arrangements covering iron ore production, and corporate governance conditions relating to the mining assets where it would hold minority stakes.
chinalco is building the new town because in order to tap a copper deposit it bought in 2007 for$ 860m, it has to decapitate a 4600-metre peak known as toromocho, or "the bull with no horns," and dig a crater that will swallow up this impoverished mining community.
chinalco is clearly looking to expand overseas and alcoa lost out to rio tinto in the bidding last year for alcan, the canadian producer.
chinalco is rio's largest shareholder.
chinalco paid 60 a share for the rio shares, a 21.2 per cent premium over thursday's closing price.
chinalco will receive one seat on rio's board in return for its investment and have the right to appoint another at a later date.
chinalco's decision to team up with rio in africa suggests either that mr albanese was right or perhaps that china is beginning to forgive or forget rio's perceived sins.
chinalco's move came just as bhp's top management, in australia for a board meeting, were leaving the office for the weekend.
chinalco's original raid on rio, orchestrated by the late lehman brothers, was a sophisticated example of city slickness.
chinalco, after all, still has a corker of a deal.
chinalco, for example, has stirred criticism by evicting locals to develop copper deposits in toromocho, peru.
chinalco, one of china's largest mining companies, and alcoa of the us revealed on friday they had bought 12 per cent of rio tinto's uk-listed shares in an audacious dawn raid.
chinalco, the chinese miner that bought a seat at the dealmaking table in february with an audacious dawn raid of rio shares, will play a key role.
chinalco, the development bank, the sovereign wealth fund and the investment bank either did not exist a decade ago or are unrecognisable from the bodies they once were.
