Yeah, and if I wasn't pro bono, I'd want my money back too.
Yeah, and if I were you, I'd probablystart to treat him a little better.
Yeah, and if Sultan doesn't give us a shot at the title...
Yeah, and if a cow had wheels, it'd be a milk truck.
Yeah, and if all else fails, mom pleads insanity.
Yeah, and if all goes according to my plan,
Yeah, and if anyone gets me a baa baa fuck sheep, I'll kill them.
Yeah, and if he knew it could lead to free ice cream, he'd change his tune.
Yeah, and if he puts his investigation on the books, it could put him at risk.
Yeah, and if he slips surveillance,
Yeah, and if he was shooting at someone, you want 'em coming back?
Yeah, and if he wasn't involved in the ceremony, his blood shouldn't have been on that blade.
Yeah, and if his take is right,
Yeah, and if it starts again, I'll be right outside the door, sitting down, off my feet.
Yeah, and if make the flight
Yeah, and if mladenich suffocates in the meantime, we're gone.
Yeah, and if no one intervenes,
Yeah, and if no one intervenes, is it still a good thing to show?

Yeah, and if people found out, you could lose that respect.
Yeah, and if pigs start flying out of my rear end,
Yeah, and if she did...
Yeah, and if she didn't know,
Yeah, and if she doesn't come back, I'd go for that friend of hers in the sweater.
Yeah, and if she still won't go away,
Yeah, and if she was a stowaway,
Yeah, and if she'd dumped him when I told her,
Yeah, and if she's left the baby outside and nobody's found it yet,
Yeah, and if she's smart enough to put this together,
Yeah, and if she's smart enough to put this together,
Yeah, and if that wasn't enough,

Yeah, and if they're all dead,
Yeah, and if two of us went missing,
Yeah, and if we adopted, we wouldn't have time
Yeah, and if we adopted, we wouldn't have time to do stuff like this.

Yeah, and if we get in a jam, you'll have to take a chance with the rest of us.
Yeah, and if we go to the police,
Yeah, and if we go to the police, he's made it so that we'll both be implicated.

Yeah, and if we hadn't showed up,
Yeah, and if we have to go, you have to go.
Yeah, and if we make the flight,
Yeah, and if we stop now, they'll have died for nothing.
Yeah, and if we succeed very quickly,
Yeah, and if we win, I win double.
Yeah, and if we win, his ticket cuts the win in half.
Yeah, and if we're lucky, the killer's skin cells.
Yeah, and if we're really lucky, they might just let us go.
