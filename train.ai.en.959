but most importantly, this treaty was ratified, overwhelmingly ratified, by the people in their democratic expression in the June election.
can you tell me, how can there be a fair election in this country when the most powerful country in the world threatens war?
this is not the will of the people. It is the fear of the people.
how dare you talk to me in the house of God. Silence!
Damien O'Donovan, you are a disgrace to the memory of your parents. Go!
the Free State Constitution was only printed the morning of the election so nobody had time to read it.
this is not the marketplace! Sit down, shut up, or get out!
and once again, the Catholic Church, with honourable exception, sides with the rich!
get out! - Get out.
I thought those days were done.
Damien.
Damien. Please.
come on, boy.
I want a word. What are you doing? You're fighting with the priest?
is it not bad enough we're fighting amongst ourselves?
and what's it all for? - Well said, Damien.
this? This radical shit? Who in the countryside is going to read this?
have you read it, Teddy? Have you?
our own uncles are scared of this stuff.
they're not waving red flags. - You've forgotten how they behaved.
our father, when he fired Pat McCan'thy because he was sick and we couldn't look at his son in the face because of the shame of it.
what has our father got to do with this?
there's one in four people out of work in this country.
I have seen children and families starving.
do we expect them to head off to New York and London?
is that what we fought for? - But we didn't fight for this.
it's too late. You won't convince me.
you've always been a dreamer. - I am not a dreamer, I am a realist.
Hm? - I need you with me on this, Damien.
we'll tear up the treaty once we're strong enough, but I need you to be with me on this. I mean, you're my...
just give me time. Give this a chance.
it's too late, Teddy. You can't see it. You really can't see it.
John Bull has got his hand down your pants, his fist round your bollocks.
that's not it.
this treaty, Teddy, this treaty makes you a servant of the British Empire.
you have wrapped yourself in the fucking Union Jack.
the butcher's apron, boy. - No.
Where's Rory, Damien?
Hey, don't do anything stupid, Damien.
do you realise you've been telling me that since I was 12 years of age?
first man, outhouse. Second man, outhouse.
you two, in the main house. Last man with me. Move it.
get over there! Get over!
get out of the house. Get out now.
get out of the way!
what's going on here? - Weapon search.
we have no weapons. You'll find no weapons.
what's going on inside here? - Get this woman against the wall!
against that wall. - How could you?
after all the times we gave you food and shelter.
up those steps. - It's a disgrace.
up against the wall. - You should be ashamed.
back. Right up here.
go on. In together where I can see the two of you.
all the times you sat at our table. Eating our food. We gave you shelter.
orders from headquarters. - To turn on your own people?
orders from the Government of the Free State.
I'll show you where the weapons are.
Sean, watch the door.
sentry, what's going on up there?
nothing, sir.
sentry, make a report. - There's nothing going on down here.
halt or I'll fire!
Dan! Dan! Hold your fire!
hold your fire! Hold your fire! Dan!
shut up! - Hold your fucking fire!
Dan is shot, lads! I'm unarmed!
I'm fucking...
No!
no, don't! Dan! Don't! Stop it, boy.
get your hands up! Get your hands up, you bastard!
get them up! Get them up! Get your hands up!
I tell you, get them up! Get them up!
that's enough! Get back!
get back! - Dan!
get back! Get into the corner!
Dan! Dan!
Jesus Christ, you fucking bastards! An unarmed man!
you shot an unarmed man in the back, Denis! Dan!
Damien, get your hands up or I will shoot!
has he eaten? - No, he's been very quiet, sir.
remember the last time we were here?
you told them you were me.
I never thanked you for that. - For all the good it did you.
I'm sorry about Dan.
and Terence. Where are they now?
they're in the basement.
lying side by side.
Jesus, Damien, you shouldn't be in here.
you should be back home. Back home with Sinead.
and tomorrow morning, you should be in hospital, teaching.
that's all you've ever wanted to do since you were a boy, isn't it? Hm?
you were always the brighter one.
better student by a mile.
you've Sinead there. She loves you. And you're meant for each other.
you should have... sons and daughters, and teach them to be gentle and... and happy.
I want out of this uniform, Damien. I want peace.
we need people like you, and even the likes of me to make that happen.
Damien, I've never begged another human in my life, but I'm going to beg you now. Heart and soul.
just brother to brother. - What do you want, Teddy?
tell us where the arms are, Damien.
take amnesty.
go home and live the life you should be living.
and we want Rory. But you talk to his boys, they'll listen to you.
you listen to me.
I shot Chris Reilly in the heart.
I did that.
you know why.
I'm not going to sell out.
better write your letters, Damien.
tell us where the arms are... or you will be shot at dawn.
did he say anything, Teddy?
dear Sinead.
I tried not to get into this war. And did.
and now try to get out and can't.
strange creatures we are, even to ourselves.
I treasure every bit of you, body and soul, in these last few moments.
you once said you wanted your children to taste freedom.
I pray for that day, too, Sinead.
but I fear it will be longer than either of us have imagined.
Dan once told me something I've struggled with all this time.
he said, "It's easy to know what you're against, quite another to know what you are for."
I think now, I know, and it gives me strength.
in time, look after Teddy.
I'm afraid, inside, he's already dead.
as the clock ticks on, I imagine your heartbeat under my hand.
I hold the medal you hung around my neck and I tremble inside.
it will give you courage, too.
goodbye, Sinead. I love you now, and always will.
left, turn.
left, left, left, right, left.
right, turn.
halt.
put your back up against the post.
forward march.
left, left, left.
it's not too late, Damien.
for me or for you?
no.
if you don't want to do this, I'll give the order.
I'll do it. Squad!
attention!
get ready!
load!
take aim!
fire!
order arms.
Sinead?
Sinead?
Sinead?
what's the matter?
what's wrong?
there's this also.
no, Sinead. No, Sinead. - No! No!
Sinead. - I...
I'm sorry. - Get off me.
get off me!
get out. Leave me. Get off my land!
I don't ever want to see you again!
Oh, Damien, no.
Oh, no.
now, you wanna play the brand new big fat game:
big fat match game, call us now...
Hello?
Hello?
who was that?
they hung up without saying. -They hung up without saying?
what you care?
you never use the damn phone in here no how.
what's up, baby?
I need you to get them phone lines up out that house.
out of the apartment? Why?
I'm saying, what Chantay gonna say...
about not havin' no line in her own place?
all right. Got you.
what's up, baby, you got a problem?
good. -I'm just sayin' though, man...
it seem we just goin' past careful, man...
with all of this, man.
like we buggin' out or something. You know, like we paranoid and shit.
Naw, I don't wanna use this phone. We used this phone yesterday.
what you blowing out your mouth for, man?
you act like...
ain't nobody out to get me, man. I got no mother fuckin' enemies.
Naw, man.
we all right.
all right, this gonna be so easy...
them Eastside chumps, they ain't nothing like Avon's people.
watch, y'all gonna see.
all right, now y'all gonna be here, right?
hold up.
yo, Boo!
I'm gonna slide up through here.
Bailey, you gonna cover the alley.
yo!
yo, Maurice short, man.
how short? -Three.
tell him to grow a couple of inches.
where you gonna be at?
that be the trap right there, homes.
you figure they roll through the alley for sure?
man, rats always run to holes in times of danger.
and you him, ain't you?
who? -Danger.
Naw, man, I'm just a nigger with a plan, that all.
and a shotgun.
for sure.
sorry I'm late.
got myself lost down the other hallway.
that leads to the loading dock. -Yeah, and deep storage.
so, this is where they put you?
quite a message they're sending.
Yeah, and that message is... -Out of sight, out of mind.
spoken like a true troglodyte.
whole lot of dead trees behind this nonsense.
the foundation of your case, detective.
you lay it in right, you can build on it.
you lay it in wrong, everything on top falls.
we ready?
do you solemnly swear and affirm that the affidavit is true...
and accurate to the best of your knowledge?
I do. -I do.
then by the power vested in me, I now declare you man and wife.
did he swear already? -The state's attorney?
Yeah.
I see it.
second copy is sealed for the court, and the police get the others.
how's this work?
same frequency as the one carried by D'Angelo Barksdale.
he gets a page, we get a page.
so, we up now? -It's official.
you're up. -Then let the game begin.
celebrities always seem much smaller when you meet them in person.
yo!
yo!
check it out, here he come.
somethin' ain't right, yo. -Watch out, man, he got that boom.
he's packing. -Here he come.
yo, come on, Omar's coming, man!
Oh, shit!
yeah...
the cheese stands alone.
how you know? -'Cause if you could, I'd have been had.
yo, he saying you can't catch the bug...
just by getting your dick sucked.
dumb-ass, you gotta be in some pussy to get it, all right?
man, wear a coat if you want, don't nobody like suckin' on a rubber.
how would you know?
who you trying to fuck anyway?
Arletta Mouzone. Treenee's cousin.
damn, man, in that case use a big-ass condom, all right?
you need a trash bag. Fuck that.
I wouldn't run up in that bitch with D'Angelo's dick...
it's triflin'.
easy to see why niggers come around here stealing our shit!
yo, you know what, nigger?
what?
forget it.
142 isn't a working telephone exchange.
six intercepts so far, and five aren't working numbers?
something wrong with the recorder?
we're getting what you'd expect, seven digits of a telephone number...
and a two-digit add-on to identify the caller, like here, 13.
mcnulty, line one.
Yeah. -Did you just get a 142 exchange?
Yeah, that's what we got, too.
that's fucked up. -All right, later.
he's got the same numbers on the readout of the cloned pagers.
so it's not the recorder.
these mopes are using a code to cover their calls?
that's pretty damn sophisticated. -What is?
they've coded the telephone numbers in their pager messages.
how do you know?
every time the Barksdale kid's pager goes off...
this machine gives us a message and time.
McNulty's carrying a cloned pager, but this is what we use in court.
same with those pen registers.
every time a pay phone in the low-rise court is used...
we get the telephone number, the time and the duration of the call.
incoming calls, too.
spy shit. Very cool.
you say they're using some kind of code?
Yeah, they got to be. These numbers don't make no fuckin' sense.
you rang? -Omar's ride.
bubbles spotted it.
different tags, no stolen report, these come back right for the van...
but Bubs makes it by the cargo rack on the roof.
good scope. You wanna take him?
can't hurt to try.
we pop Omar, get a gun, he might let us work him.
anything coming through on the pager?
eight hits so far, most of them in some kind of code.
these ain't Baltimore exchanges, that's for sure.
three weeks to get Daniels to agree, a week to write out the affidavit...
and then this bullshit.
how complex a code can it be if these knuckleheads are using it?
then again, what does it say about us if we can't break it?
you wanna run Bubs back downtown, I'll sit here and wait for you.
all right.
What'd I miss, girlfriend? -Not a goddamn thing.
Yeah, boring, ain't we?
how y'all do what you do every day and not wanna get high?
that's what I be asking.
it's been a little hectic down here, right, cuz?
string, man, I can't lie.
them stick-up boys, they caught us dead up.
and the knockos, shit, I don't know what the fuck that was.
5-0. Comin' up!
5-0 comin' up, y'all. -Time-out.
C'mon, man, what is that? -What?
you gotta get your crew to understand that...
it's the stick-up crews and the creepers...
that give us the most trouble.
when they start thinking like that...
you're not gonna have any more surprises, you feel me?
cause you know, your uncle and me...
we think you got a snitch up in the shop.
what? -Someone who tips off the stick-up crew.
and you gotta be on that, right? You gotta be on that.
I'm gonna tell you what you do.
what day is it today, Friday?
what happen on Friday?
payday. -Not this Friday.
why not?
no, what you gonna do is you gonna call 'em...
Iike you gonna pay 'em and then you crack 'em.
you tell 'em you're not happy...
with what they fuckin' pass as work down here.
and when you're not happy, they ain't gettin' paid. You feel me?
Yeah, but string, you don't pay a nigger, he ain't gonna work for you.
what, you think a nigger's gonna get a job?
you think these niggers gonna be like, "Fuck it...
Iet me quit this game here and go to college"?
Naw, they gonna buck a little, but they not gonna walk.
and in the end, you gonna get respect. -Yeah.
and when that money run out, they'll come up to you and roll on you...
and when that money run out, they'll come up to you and roll on you...
and ask you for an advance and shit, when they flat-ass broke.
them the niggers that you strike off your list.
but that nigger that stay eatin'...
the nigger that steady rollin', ain't askin' you for shit...
that's the nigger I want to hear about. Understand?
Yeah, man, shit, you know how to play a nigger into a corner, String.
yo, take care of this right here. -You my favorite girl.
shit, let me handle this, man.
yo, Poot. -Yeah, I
come here, man. -What's happening?
what the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?
you know the fuckin' rules.
what the fuck are you doing? -Copying.
a telephone.
this fucking detail is too much for me.
it's after 3: 00.
so, where are the boys at?
maybe they only come out at night.
I used to have a guy like Omar working for me.
guy named Reuben Terry.
is he good?
saw the street like we wish we could.
ain't nothing like a good Cl.
school's out.
can I use your cell phone?
Yeah, I got that. I did.
I know.
I don't know about this...
what do you mean, you don't know? -How can I trust you...
for chrissakes, Elena, I'm their father. You think I'd let 'em sleep on the floor?
Yes, I got them.
sheets, pillows, comforters, pillowcases.
I fuckin' got them.
what color are they?
color, what the fuck do you care what color they are? Hello?
lost her. -I bet.
you know something?
my ex-wife, the way she acts sometimes, the way she deals with shit...
you would think a less enlightened man than myself, cruder man than myself...
a man less sensitized to the qualities and charms and value of women...
a man like that, not me, but a man like that, he just might call her a cunt.
you just called the mother of your children a cunt.
no, I did not call her that.
Yes, you fuckin' did. -No, I did not.
let's just leave this, okay? I got some stuff to do.
5-0, gotta go. Whoa, man, get out the way!
shit.
not much fighting this time. You getting tired, asshole?
still dragging from the whupping Kima put on him.
fucked you up like a cop should, didn't she?
that's one thing about Kima, she put a hurtin' on you like a man.
get your monkey ass up.
you're gonna want your business card back, right?
come on.
from Bantry Bay to the Derry Quay.
and from Galway to Dublin town.
well, I've never seen.
my brown Colleen.
that I met in the County Down.
there's a man in the County Down.
there's a man in the County Down.
first, I go in, play nice.
then you come in, play bad. -I ain't gonna be playin'.
bracelet too tight?
you rackin' up all kinds of points, ain't you?
first, you put a cop in the hospital, damn near kill his ass with that punch.
now, you on the wing from Boys' Village.
man, I'm 16, all right? What the fuck they gonna do to me?
that's the least of your worries, my friend.
I got a partner outside who can't wait to get in here and fuck you up.
cop you banged was Herc's uncle.
Herc wants off the leash on this one.
and I suppose you at the other end of that leash?
see, I don't want to play it that way.
I know about comin' up hard and all.
why, you came up hard?
flag House projects. Eastside.
Yeah, Flag House?
you know, you remind me of me.
I'm thinking we should work something out.
what do I get?
what you want?
I want...
for you to suck my dick.
I'll beat your fuckin' monkey ass.
you supposed to be the good cop, dumb motherfucker.
what?
Hello, may I help you? -Yeah, we'd like a table.
and you have reservations?
Naw, I thought, you know, we could just walk in...
let me see what I got.
that's two?
follow me, please.

can we get that one, over there? -It's Friday night...
those are for patrons who made reservations.
let me get your chair for you, ma'am.
it's okay, man, all right. -Here you are.
here you are, sir.
your waiter will be with you shortly.
you shoulda pushed him, Dee.
bastards.
Sarge, nobody answers at juvenile intake and we been calling.
clearly, they're not as dedicated as you two detectives.
so what time does the duty intake consultant get here?
you missed the 8: 00. You got another one around midnight.
midnight? -You think maybe if we left you...
the paperwork, you could put him in the box 'til intake gets here?
hemorrhoid.
for the crumbs.
Yeah, right.
you like your dinner? -Yeah.
that shrimp was right. -Yeah, it was good, right?
think they know?
do they know what?
you know. What I'm about.

acting like we belong down here, know what I'm saying?
so? Your money good, right?
Dee, we ain't the only black people in here.
it ain't what I'm talking about. It's about where we... Come on, you know.
I'm just saying, you know, I feel like some shit just stay with you...
you know what I'm saying, like, hard as you try...
you still can't go nowhere, you know what I'm saying?
can I interest you in dessert? -Yes, thank you.
can I have some chocolate cake? - I'll bring the cart.
boy, don't nobody give a damn about you and your story.
you got money, you get to be whatever you say you are.
that's the way it is.
sir, I'm sorry. These are the samples.
and for you, sir? Very good.
don't be a bitch, admit it.
go ahead.
admit you're wrong, be a man. -Yeah, I gotta confess...
this sub beats chink- ass Bob's by a mile.
but you can't do shit with that stick, man.
you'd do better. -I play.
says he plays.
he might.
I'm even better with two hands.
I checked it out, man. Stinkum true on this one.
except for that nigger, Scar, from New York...
Edmondson gully is wide open.
what about Tee-Tee's crew?
Naw, them niggers dried up when they took that federal charge.
most of 'em laid up somewhere, gettin' high and shit.
I'll tell you what. You holler at the boy Scar.
let him know, man, it's time for him to take a stroll.
if he give you any beef at all, we'll put Wee-Bey and Bird on it.
all right. -And then once we got him outta there...
we'll send in the smokers to run out all the little poop-butt locals and shit.
or, if you think there's some cats in there who got game...
then we put'em on our team. -All right, who you want to run it?
send Stinkum up here. -All right.
he the one who saw the shot. So, he gets a shot.
all right, okay, not bad.
can't let the duty officer see that.
you wanna give it a rest, man? You down $60.
that might be your whole damn salary, but I clock that shit in minutes.
rack 'em and break 'em, man. -You the guys waiting for juvenile intake?
he's in the squad room.
if I had more time, I'd run you.
give you a tip, Preston.
you gonna run a hustle, you best stay with what you know.
man, fuck you and your tired-ass advice, all right?
but that sandwich was good.
you gonna move our little thing down to Edmondson Avenue.
take the gully.
what about Scar?
who?
listen, I'm giving you points on the package...
so, you make a go of it, you hear me?
you working for yourself, too, so you gonna put out the strong product...
and you gonna get the locals behind it.
it's as simple as that. You get your team together, you feel me?
go and wait for me downstairs. I'll be down in a minute, man.
we gonna make this money run in a few. -Smile or something, nigger.
made that nigger's night. -Yeah, he deserved it, though.
he deserved it.
it's Wee-Bey. We got one.
you think it's Omar? -Nah.
it's one of the young 'uns, I think. -One down, two to go, right?
Yeah, motherfuckers. Try to rob me, baby.
one, two, three.
a winner. -A match? Which case?
the one you just brought me, Bunk. Casing in that girl shot up in Northeast.
Kresson? -Diedre Kresson, right, yeah.
she matches up with two other cases, both from last year.
which ones? -Toreen Boyle...
someone named Ligget. It's in the report. -It's Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.
Yeah, them.
casings from all three killings go to a . 45, probably Colt Classic.
that fucker Landsman. How's he do it? -You like Landsman for these three?
I don't know, Bunk.
as sergeants go, Jay's a sociopath and all, but I'd have to go with an actual gangster.
Jimmy, you sitting down?
I said it was hot, but ifyou got these barbecue gloves.
you got a Johnny Weeks up in here?
who? -Johnny Weeks.
over in the game room. -Obliged.
any smokes? -I'm out.
how long have you been here? You gotta give the medication...
a chance to work in your system, man.
brought you something.
Yeah, some chicken pieces and some fries.
bought you a shake, but I dropped it on the bus.
it comes in a bag, goes out in a bag.
how long you have that for?
there was nothing I could do, you know?
it's like first I got beat, right, then I get this.
what are these for?
they say I got the bug.
the bug?
they checked me when I was in the hospital
are they sure?
where you been at?
here and there, I'm at it.
I'd have come past sooner, but I been on kinda like a mission.
a mission? -Yeah. Them hoppers that beat you down...
they got problems now.
them and the people they sling for, even.
what?
I put the police on their ass.
police?
what, you get locked up or something? -No, come on.
no, I'm not working for them. I'm working with them.
they don't give me the badge soon enough, I keep doing like I do.
Why?
what do you mean why? How can you ask me why?
why the fuck are you in here, man, with all these falling-down motherfuckers?
why you passing shit through a bag?
why they beat you down?
why I couldn't do nothing about it?
it's all part of the game, right?
I mean, you taught me that.
what you up to in here, man?
doing the meetings. -N. A.?
Yeah. Twice a day.
that's good, man. It's good, you give the body comfort, you know.
Yeah. -No, you needed a change.
guess so.
I'll be getting out of here the end of the month.
it's all right. They got meetings everywhere.
you ain't gotta worry about that.
who's got the best package now?
get the fuck out of here, man. -I'm coming home, right?
shit is weak all over, you know?
got some boys up in Baker and Calhoun, though.
they had a smoker out the other day though.
yeah? -Knocked a couple of niggers out.
ain't you a trip?
beat down, bagged up, still ready to rip and run, huh?
I'm a Viking, homes.
I'm a Viking, homes.
there's something here that needs kissing.
speak again, toothless one.
I guess you know now why I wear the stripes in the family.
good call, Jay. Of course, if Keeley hadn't fucked the scene up...
you'd have had that casing months ago, right?
Keeley. Let Keeley be Keeley.
we all can't be princes of the city, now can we?
speaking of which...
sit down.
may I ask you a question that is essential to your career?
what? -Who do you serve?
I am asking you to identify for the record your commanding officer.
major Rawls. -Excellent.
and with that thought in mind, I advise you to go immediately into the Major's office...
carrying the break I've given you in the Kresson case...
and kiss the man's ring. Because...
I have talked you right out of the shithouse.
here's the deal.
you wrap up this thing with Narcotics in two weeks.
you put yourself back in the rotation when we go back to night work.
you do that and you're back in the fold.
Thanks, Jay. -No problem.
shit ain't right.
you work, you get paid.
that's what I'm saying.
I'm gonna say something to him, all right?
you should. -Truth.
what's up, Dee? -What's up, Shorty?
$530, the count is right, man.
okay, re-ups on the way down.
go tell Sterling to be ready for it.
all right. Yo, Dee, man.
you know, me and Poot, we been steady working it, you know?
nothing sloppy, no troubles, right?
no.
and we was wondering if, maybe you could let a little something go...
until payday, 'cause you know, right now, we some broke-ass niggers, man.
right now, whoever did our girl...
also did Boyd and Leggett a month earlier.
Leggett. -And those two are definitely...
straight-up drug executions.
no mention of Dee in either file.
but I did get a fresh number...
on Tywanda. -Who?
the girl who called in on Kresson.
right. -She put Dee in for that.
have you seen this?
jaybird.
and the bear said, "You didn't really come here to hunt now, did you?"
you see Saturday's 24s? -Sunday morning.
did you see the one Worden got on the Westside?
John Bailey, in a Kevlar vest, lit up by three separate shooters.
carey Street.
you made the Kresson connection...
you didn't think Bailey might tie in with Barksdale?
Worden's on the other shift. I'm trying to work my murders, Jesus Christ.
Tony, Line 3.
what took you so long?
you might've heard, we get a few murders here in Baltimore...
sometimes we just get backed up.
you weren't followed here? -Why would we be followed?
Diedre was playing with scary people.
who might that be?
you called this in after the murder and you told the detective...
that you talked to her the night she was killed.
she called. It was late.
she didn't talk long, she said she had to go. Dee was at the door.
and that was the last time you spoke with her?
Yeah, she was killed that night. -Dee was her boyfriend?
no, Dee was his nephew or something.
Dee would be D'Angelo Barksdale.
you know Avon?
the question is how do you know him?
you out there running the street with the players?
I used to be...
but not after this thing with Diedre. I mean, damn.
we used to go to Odell's for ladies' nights...
and one time he was there with all his people in one of the big booths...
ordering drinks, acting like he was king of everything.
and Diedre ate that shit up.
and you? -I ain't gonna lie.
I did the club thing for a while, but...
some of those places, everybody in there's on some kind of game.
but Diedre went with Avon?
she was with Avon for like a year...
and something happened. Toward the end, she started getting real possessive...
and that didn't sit with Avon, 'cause he has other girls, too.
she started bitching on him one minute...
crying the next minute, threatening to do all kinds of things.
she threatened Avon Barksdale? -The girl was off the hook.
one time, she threatened to write a letter on him.
a letter. -A letter to the state's attorney.
supposed to be some sort of kin to her.
she said that if he dumped her...
she was gonna tell about the drugs.
did she write this letter? -I don't know.
I tried talking to her about the way she was acting, but she wouldn't let it go.
she even had it out with him in his club one night in front of all the people.
what, Avon has a club?
Orlando's, titty bar.
does he own it? -That's what Diedre said.
she said he owned a whole mess of stuff.
tell me something, man. -What's that?
how can you run this place and not just OD on pussy?
shit.
you try dealing with all these bitches and their problems for a few days.
get so you'd rather be running a god damn laundromat out this fucker.
heard you're doing okay in the Pit.
Yeah, well. -What, you ain't getting it like that?
man, my uncle still got me working on salary.
damn, boy.
you ain't the only one your uncle keeps close.
what?
come on, man, you ain't making no ends?
I know you getting something on this by now.
no, man.
I'm just the front, clean name for the liquor board.
I'm saying-- -What the fuck?
is there a problem? That was for the drink before.
it was for this one.
it ain't like I'm calling your uncle out or nothing...
but give a nigger a chance. Plenty of pie out there for everybody.
believe.
you heard Stinkum gonna be coming off the clock, right? Getting a percentage.
what? -Open up fresh territory.
take over the corners down near Edmondson and Brice.
so, my uncle gave that to Stink?
figured you knew.
excuse me, Orlando, can you help me down here, please?
I already paid for that last drink. -That was for the drink before.
hell, no, that was for this one. -What's up here?
look, he ain't paid for that drink and I took $20 off the bar.
look she took $20, then $20 more. -Hell I did.
come on, now, why you gonna do me like this?
I been with you for an hour and a half buying drinks.
look, man, this ain't right. I just spent $120 in drinks, $40 in tips.
now, you gonna take all that and still try to sneak into my pocket?
shit, girl! -You got to go, get him the fuck outta here.
I ain't done so much as touch your kneecap.
trying to treat her with a little respect, and this is the way you do me?
wait, wait!
why you do that?
did you take his money? -No, I didn't take his money.
you buying me a drink?
can I see you sometime?
like, you know, not in here.
I don't usually see men that I meet in here.
usually.
what kind of strip joint has a video camera looking out?
more to it than the girls, maybe.
so, he's got the club, he's got the warehouse...
he's got the apartment building by Druid Hill Lake...
he's got the tow truck company...
and that's just what she knew from what he bragged about to the dead girl.
major likes assets. -The Deputy, too, I imagine.
nothing like a few property forfeitures to swell the departmental operation budget.
check city assessments to see who owns the club.
run the company name through the state corporate charter office.
also, Homicide picked up one Saturday night. Might be one of ours.
John Bailey, he's a stick-up artist I used to know from the Murphy homes.
he was wearing Kevlar, but it didn't help.
39 casings on the scene, from three different guns.
overkill for a burn bag...
but about right if he was running with Omar.
look it, our buddy.
just once, I wish they'd use the right number.
ain't like him to be late.
Bailey, you fucking dope fiend. I'm telling you...
them fucking people ain't to be relied on.
why you always gotta talk like that, man?
what? -"F" this and "f" that.
if I give it up, I lose half of what I mean to say.
don't nobody want to hear them dirty words, man.
especially coming from such a beautiful mouth.
wait for Bailey?
early bird catches the worm, dog.
I beeped you. -I didn't get it.
let me see. -You want to see my pager?
sure, Prez, you want to see my pager?
I beeped you too. -You all right, Prez?
I got that. That was you?
you try it?
Yeah, I tried it. Twice.
non-working number.
it would've worked if you knew the code.
shit, I'm as surprised as you.
I like word-search puzzles.
you know, where you gotta find the hidden words?
so, I thought I could do the same thing with the numbers.
take the number I sent you.
now, take the seven and jump it over the five.
you get three.
jump the one over the five...
you get nine.
with four you get six.
three, that's seven, four is six...
a three again...
and two is eight.
zero switches with the five.
so 714-3432 is...
our number.
and that's the code?
and it works, because it's all about where the buttons are on a phone.
if it was a code that involved math...
or algebra or whatever...
these little yos in the projects wouldn't be able to follow along.
but with this, all you gotta do is jump the five button.
ain't no math to it. It's just...
how a phone looks when you look at it.
Prez, you little genius!
Jesus. -I could kill you, that's so good.
your mother keep ragging at me...
to take him outta here and put him in a private nursing home.
you know, she ain't never gonna let that go.
I keep telling her, man, we can't show this legal money yet, man...
especially since he ain't got no insurance.
soon, though.
so, you ain't big on coming here, right?
no.
tell you something, man...
you about to see your uncle, you understand me?
this is family. -I know.
family is what counts, family is what it's about.
family gonna always be there 'cause it's blood.
man.
you never figured on this, did you?
live the life, lead the life. Ain't no big thing.
he used to talk that shit all the time and he believed it, you know what I'm saying?
what's up, baby, talk that shit now.
you know, you're right. It's kind of hard to be in here right now.
he scare you, don't he?
you know, I'm just saying-- -He scares me.
see, if he dead, you know, I could carry it better.
coming up the way we did, you kind of expect that.
waiting on it.
see...
the thing is, you only got to fuck up once.
be a little slow, be a little late. Just once.
and how you ain't gonna never be slow...
never be late?
you can't plan for no shit like this, man.
it's life.
scares me.
they're still using it. I was by on Saturday night and it was gone.
on your own time?
you still getting your boys?
Yeah, tonight for a sleep-over.
Omar's rolling.
what the hell?
call for backup?
not yet.
let's see how it plays out.
an invitation.
feel a little lonesome for backup.
Yeah, me, too.
that's nice.
I'll check the rear. -I'll watch the boys.
afternoon, gentlemen.
saying, if you were gonna use that you would've been done using it by now.
it's clean.
got to keep it clean.
we having one of our little parlays like this, got to keep it clean, right?
omar with no gun on the street? Must be a first.
Yeah, sometimes who you are is enough, dog.
but being as y'all sitting on my ride so long, I thought I'd save y'all some time.
come straight on out.
I ain't taking no charge. You ain't putting me back in no cage.
we're not here to bury you, Omar.
we're pulling you up 'cause we got a problem in common.
problem? -Barksdale.
no, he ain't no problem. -I don't know.
avon's been chalking up a lot of bodies. And you being you...
put it that way, I guess he could be a little problem...
but I just can't really come out and help you all.
you know what I mean?
snitchin' just rubs me wrong.
personally, I don't think the game is played like that.
we respect that.
if you do happen to take a charge though...
I'm McNulty, that's Greggs.
you give us a call, we'll sort something out.
fair enough.
you know, I used to work the homes, back when your brother was up there.
you get a chance...
let him know they blew up John Bailey last night.
good man.
lot of enemies.
saying, you trying to catch up with Bird?
word is he dropped a workin' man.
wait, hold up. Come on, don't play me.
what workin' man, what Bird?
come on, now, ain't but one working man, now, is there?
and Bird? I think your snitch can handle that.
shit, Bubbles know Bird.
you working late?
a little.
got a minute?
sure, have a seat.
no, this is better said standing up.
you know, I've been 13 years on the shelf. I ain't bitched.
it was me that put me there.
but I'm here now, and I gotta say a piece.
we should've had a tap on the project pay phones by now.
a wire there will get us the drugs.
keep pushing, we'll get a whiff of the money, too.
I know you're serious about climbing that career ladder...
and I know how slippery it gets the higher you go...
but for me...
I don't want to go to no dance unless I can rub some tit.
I appreciate your honesty.
good night, Lieutenant.
so, what you say to make Dee pay out?
I told him to give it up or I'm taking him out of the count.
shit. -Look.
I'll pump niggers when I got to.
that's him. -That's who?
one of the ones that robbed us. That light-skinned boy.
that's him?
all right, come on.
I'm the king of this shit.
so, you want us to wait? -Yeah.
all right, we on it, man. -All right.
there goes Scar right there.
right there in the blue?
number 80? -Yeah, I'm on him.
all right, you got him?
find a phone real quick. -What's wrong?
it looks like my man Dee got himself an emergency.
what, he been stuck up again?
what's up, what do you need?
my people are onto one of Omar's boys down at Greek's.
word? All right, sit tight. I'm gonna take care of it.
all right.
ain't nobody coming.
Dee said wait.
Dee said wait.
told you.
he still in there? -Yeah, he's playing the games.
all right. You are sharp, son. What's your name?
Wallace. -Wallace, all right.
this nigger's gonna point him out to us, all right?
Yeah.
it's done. Nice work, cuz.
all right.
they're still vialing up.
usually come off the train street-ready, but this time they gotta vial.
y'all got any testers, man?
Yeah, later. - Later?
got any testers, man?
nigger, it ain't even 9: 00, and you fiending on it.
get the fuck out of here, man.
damn.
why you act like that?
what, for these junkie motherfuckers?
so you just gonna take his money all day and treat him like a dog?
how I'm supposed to treat him? - I don't know.
but you ain't got to punk him like that.
he punked himself. He's a goddamn drug addict.
and you a goddamn drug dealer.
so?
so what?
what, the customer's always right?
we're in the projects. The customer be fucked up.
you can't give these niggers shit, man.
why not? Why can't you?
shit, everything else in the world get sold without people taking advantage.
Scamming, lying, doing each other dirty.
why has it got to be that way with this?
cause they dope fiends.
Yeah, but the game ain't gotta be played like that.
you can't tell me this shit can't get done without people beating on each other...
killing each other, doing each other like dogs.
without all that you ain't got 5-0 here on our backs every five minutes...
throwing us around and shit.
shit, man.
you think 5-0 would care about niggers getting high?
in the projects?
man, 5-0 be down here about the bodies.
that's what they be down here about, the bodies.
squires, young squires.
what you want, nigger?
a little bag of styles, man, a little bag of styles for you.
check it out.
??
only $5, what's up with that?
$5 make you a gallant motherfucker, right there, boy.
him, we know.
what are we facing from the riot?
three witnesses' statements...
all of them saying the officer's assault... on the youth was unprovoked.
you know how that goes, Commissioner.
people's idea of police brutality is whenever we win a fight.
what does the state's attorney say?
he says it goes to a grand jury.
that's him doing Pontius Pilate.
the grand jury doesn't indict, he looks clean for passing the buck.
and if they do indict?
they won't.
criminal histories on our three witnesses...
one longer than the next.
drugs, weapons, assault... more drugs.
shitbirds throwing dirt at good police.
just the same, Lieutenant.
I want you to rethink whatever tactic led you to send three plainclothes officers to do field interviews at the high-rises at 2: 00 in the morning.
Yes, sir.
I take it your people have union counsel?
Yes, sir.
sir, I would request...
that pending the grand jury review...
officer Pryzbylewski be placed on administrative leave.
I can use him in-office, but we shouldn't have him on the street until the grand jury signs off.
that's putting our tail between our legs.
I think our official stance has to be...
he did nothing wrong out there.
a 14-year-old is half-blind.
and two of ours were injured as well.
goddamn right. They were fucking shooting at us out there.
Bobby, what do you think?
keep him off the streets...
until it clears the courthouse.
okay, then, we'll wait on the grand jury.
lieutenant. A moment, please.
what happened out there?
did you know they were in the high-rises without backup?
if I tell you yes... I screwed up.
if I tell you no...
I'm putting my men in the jackpot.
do you still want me to answer?
I screwed up, sir.
good man, willing to take one for the company.
to hell with the company.
I'm defending my own people here, that's all.
what Major Valchek means to say is that he's grateful that you...
extended your support on behalf of Officer Pryzbylewski.
fuck-up that he is. - He should be off the street.
what can I say? The kid needs...
a little guidance, a little supervision.
Stan here thought that if he got a young officer back on the street...
where he might start over.
a new unit, a new lieutenant.
you know, that it might bring him around.
I understand he messed up here.
I understand that.
which is why I'm saying to you...
I owe you...
for walking him through this grand jury thing.
and to compensate, Southeastern is sending you two new unmarked units, and a surveillance van.
Plus, you need manpower...
while these guys are busy with this lID thing...
all you do is ask.
lieutenant.
so I've got suction with you, Valchek?
that's what I'm saying.
deputy, always a pleasure.
a necessary evil.
what? - Valchek.
is it insubordinate if I ask what's so necessary?
thanks for not cutting Pryzbylewski loose.
if you had, the department would be caught between Valchek and city hall.
I owe you for that.
this Barksdale...
he's dug in.
it may take more than buy-bust.
and since it's been in the press about the witness
it's not an issue.
keep it a tight little circle.
give me three weeks of good street work and you'll see this through.
a couple of felony warrants, a little dope on the table.
that's all we need here.
under no circumstances is it accurate to suggest that this particular homicide was the result of the victim having been a witness in an earlier case.
reports to the contrary are without factual merit.
are you saying that you know definitely that this man was not killed...
because he testified? - We think that...
I mean, that is...
we're looking into the possibility that Mr. Gant was involved in a street dispute.
which, of course, would have nothing to do...
with his being a witness...
in an unrelated case that concluded weeks ago.
but you haven't developed a suspect at this time?
no, we haven't.
bunk, shame on you, lad.
what did you expect him to do?
I don't know, grab the mike shove Rawls to the ground, declare that all of Baltimore should rise as one because they're murdering witnesses in cold blood.
that sounds more like one of your moves.
been working on him two weeks, we don't even have a photo.
it's fucking embarrassing.
Hey, Pat.
we got a job for you guys to try to run down.
what is it?
we need a photo of this guy, Barksdale.
we need to know what he looks like.
so go down to the B of l.
you see, that's the problem, guys.
Barksdale's never been arrested as an adult...
so we don't really have a B of I photo.
he had his juvenile record expunged, so there's no photo there either.
then you're fucked.
Yeah, we are.
but seeing as we all came into work today,
I thought, let's try something different.
so we know from his mother's social service record...
that Barksdale grew up in Franklin Terrace, right?
it occurred to me...
being vaguely familiar with the high-rises of West Baltimore...
that the housing project began to take photos...
of every registered resident as a security measure.
am I correct, Detective Greggs?
Yeah.
so you want us to go down to the housing department and pull his photo.
excellent.
you know, you and l, we think as one.
we're like two horses together in a harness.
why don't you fucking do it yourself?
sure, if you don't mind sitting in my desk, reviewing homicide folders...
taking meticulous notes, trying to run down a few new leads.
it's boring, painstaking work, but if you don't want to travel to the housing department,
I'll switch with you.
fuck it, Patrick. - Let's take a ride.
that was inspiring.
I'm a leader of men.
what's up with shop?
no re-up.
why not?
cause we out of red caps.
stink say we gonna have a new package tomorrow.
new package? - yeah.
Yeah, man, this weak-ass stepped-on shit we got out here get these fiends agitated.
look at them, they still buying it, though.
Yes, they're buying twice as much and only getting half as high.
what was that?
castle can't move like that.
castle move up and down or sideways like.
no, we ain't playing that.
look at the board, we're playing checkers.
checkers? - Yeah, checkers.
Why're y'all playing checkers on a chess set?
why do you give a shit? Man, we ain't got no checkers.
Yeah, but chess is a better game.
so?
no, hold up.
you all don't know how to play chess, do you?
so?
so? So, nothing, man.
I'll teach y'all if you want to learn.
come on, man. No, come on. We're right in the middle of a game.
chill out, I want to see this.
y'all can't be playing no checkers on no chessboard.
all right..., man.
look, check it, it's simple.
see this?
this is the kingpin. eh?
and he the man.
you get the other dude's king, you got the game.
but he's trying to get your king, too, so you gotta protect it.
now the king, he moves one space...
any direction he damn choose, 'cause he's the king.
like this, this, this, all right?
but he ain't got no hustle...
but the rest of these motherfuckers on the team...
they got his back.
and they run so deep, he really ain't gotta do shit.
like your uncle.
Yeah, like my uncle.
you see this? This is the queen.
she's smart and she's fierce.
she moves any way she wants, as far as she wants.
and she is the go-get-shit-done piece.
remind me of Stringer.
and this, over here, is the castle.
it's like the stash.
it moves like this.
and like this.
dog, stash don't move, man.
come on, think. How many times we move the stash house this week?
right? And every time we move the stash...
we got to move a little muscle with it to protect it.
true, true. you're right.
all right. What about them little bald-headed bitches right there?
these right here.
these are the pawns. They're like the soldiers.
they move like this, one space forward only...
except when they fight. Then it's like...
or like this.
and they like the front lines. They be out in the field.
so how do you get to be the king?
it ain't like that.
see, the king stays the king, all right?
everything stays who he is except for the pawns.
now if a pawn...
makes it all the way down to the other dude's side...
he gets to be queen.
and like I said, the queen ain't no bitch.
she got all the moves.
all right, so...
if I make it to the other end, I win?
if you catch the other dude's king and trap it, then you win.
but if I make it to the end...
I'm top dog.
no, it ain't like that, look.
the pawns, man, in the game...
they get capped quick.
they be out of the game early.
unless they're some smart-ass pawns.
Nagras. Can you fucking believe this?
this shit is prehistoric.
what else have they got down there in Property?
Eight-tracks? Victrolas? That fucking department's a joke.
we got to get with the feds somehow.
they got light-weights, wireless micro-recorders.
Yeah, DEA got those.
if I wear this on a warm day, they're gonna know.
even if they do a half-assed search, I'm done.
Nagras. Jesus.
you can't send his ass into the projects with this shit taped to him.
that ain't gonna play.
I'm saying.
mcnulty and the girl...
the lezzer from narcotics, they've got the file.
who are you partnered with? - McNulty.
but he don't have shit to do with me and I don't want nothing to do with him neither.
major, I'm a fifth wheel on a car that's going nowhere.
bring me home.
soon enough.
look, you're my eyes and ears in this mess, right?
and I don't want no more surprises, like that newspaper article.
if McNulty's planning any more bullshit like that...
I got to be able to tell the deputy before the shit flies.
then you come home with a favor in your pocket.
how bad is that?
lieutenant.
you get Carver and Prez back tomorrow, but Prez is in-office.
no police powers, no street work, nothing.
if the building catches fire, he stays in the office.
what about Herc?
medical, until Monday at least.
I wonder what you gotta do to get thrown off this police force.
keep on with some of your shit, you just might find out.
where are the fucking run sheets?
behind the board.
you all go for a taste?
we got your picture, don't you fucking worry, McNulty.
this is Barksdale?
I don't think so.
read my lips.
avon fucking Barksdale.
his name's on the form in the file.
excuse me for giving a shit...
but I can't help but notice this is a middle-aged white man.
you want something different, you give me another name.
that's the only Avon Barksdale in the housing department files.
you got your smokes?
have a nice fucking day.
maybe he's white.
no, I mean, really. What do we really know?
avon Barksdale. 31 years of age.
born Provident Hospital, West Baltimore...
to Willette Jackson Barksdale...
father unknown.
educated Baltimore city schools.
address is in the same public housing where he controls the drug trade.
no flash, no profile.
pretty much comes up out of nowhere.
no work history. No tax information we can look at.
no cars in his name, no driver's license.
no kids.
no priors either.
Yeah, here's this vague CI information...
that states he stays in various apartments out in the county.
addresses undetermined, of course.
he moves from girlfriend to girlfriend...
might have another girlfriend in New York.
he likes to work out and he used to box Golden Gloves when he was younger.
I've been working on him for two weeks and the truth is, we don't know shit.
golden Gloves?
how did you hear that?
I don't know. I...
I think I got that from a DEA File.
or from a Cl...
who claimed to know him way back when.
so you write everything down?
Yeah, everything.
goddamn bomb, y'all. - Blue-tops, blue-tops.
double shorts.
in the hole, man.
got blue-tops. Looking for blues?
in the hole, y'all.
blue-tops. - Red-tops.
???
Red-tops. - Two for $10.
Blue-tops, blue-tops.
keep your jab moving.
move with your right. Left, right, left, right.
two punches.
I got a few questions I wanna ask you, Mack.
keep your hands moving, work to the body some.
so who's your target?
Barksdale. - Who?
avon Barksdale. never heard of him.
that's the thing.
this guy's got the Westside projects locked up.
he's tied to maybe a dozen murders, he's completely off the radar.
avon, what was it? - Barksdale.
if you say so.
DEA has a couple of pages on him from NADDIS entries.
nothing in NCIC, no adult arrests.
I've been working drugs for the Bureau since '98.
I can tell you, we got nothing on him that I know.
this little thing...
is the smile of the week.
watch this.
what? - What was that?
get the door.
it's a career case.
not that my bosses give a damn at this point.
why not?
why not?
all of them mopes in bracelets and not one of them named Osama.
I owe you, brother. What do you need?
a couple of lightweight body mikes.
wireless, remote taping capability.
that's all? - ???
where I come from, we're just happy to be in the 20th century.
who's running the case, so I can tell my squad supervisor?
Daniels, out of Narcotics.
all right, no problem.
shit! Fucking rain, man.
all right, y'all know what the fuck this is.
up against the wall, hurry the fuck up. - Come on, let's go.
go on to the back. Ain't got time for this shit.
got some red-tops, some testers. Get them around the corner.
hurry up, take them around.
what the fuck you looking at me for? Get your ass around the corner.
I want that shit, that's good.
???
keep it moving.
man, you see that?
Yeah.
third from the end. That's the stash.
some real raggedy-ass shit here, boy.
very sloppy.
how old are your kids?
Mike is 8, Sean's 10.
that's the hard part.
Yeah, that's the hard part, but you know...
how often do you get to see them?
every other weekend.
trying to get more, but she's fighting me.
why would she fight you on that?
she's getting even.
getting even?
you must've been fucking around.
I'm just saying. - You're right.
it's always the case.
a woman wants to get even, there's something extra there.
how come you got all this wisdom and your life's so fucking hard?
I've been wondering on that myself.
how about you? You ever been married?
What'd I say?
if you ain't gonna say anything, I am.
what?
if you're a dog, you barking at the wrong pussy.
what, so I'm a dog now?
meow. - Bubbles.
I date women.
we've got something else in common. I date women, too.
so pretty much everyone in CID has worked this out but me?
there wasn't nothing to figure out. I told them.
I guess I missed the press conference.
it's better that than to have every police on three shifts hounding you every goddamned day.
cops are dogs. - Yeah.
it's not like I was walking around waving some dyke flag in the air, or some shit.
I know I look like I could go either way.
Lord, yes, you do. Yes, you do.
it was something I had to put out there to get through the day.
I should've known.
should've known what?
I worked with one other female police officer who was worth a damn, only one.
a lesbian. - Yeah.
in the beginning, you're in your radio car, alone, working your post.
most women aren't getting out of that car.
right.
not without side partners showing up.
they're intimidated, physically.
they gotta be. - You weren't?
Yeah, at first.
but I'm talking about some old straight-out-of-the-academy-type scared...
you know what I'm saying? I wasn't about to stay scared.
you know, you get your ass kicked once or twice you realize it's not the end of the world, right?
most of the women, they don't want to believe that.
some of the men, too. They don't even want to go there.
you think 'cause you're gay? - I don't know.
but is there any other fucking way to police?
all I know is I just love the job.
that'll be $3. 20.
keep the change. - Thanks, have a nice day.
Dee's coming up.
Where's it all go?
the money.
where do all the money go?
$22, 000 or $24, 000, give or take.
from the low-rises?
damn, boy! You must have that crew humming.
I don't remember a day we ever got this much from the Courtyard.
it wasn't even check day.
you doing good out there, Dee.
we'll be doing even better when we get that new package.
new package, same as old, man.
say what? - Ain't no new package.
just gonna put that same shit out in a different color gelcap is all.
might spike that shit with some procaine or some caffeine, but otherwise the same.
string, man, people are already coming back on us telling us that shit is weak.
I know, the shit is weak. But shit is weak all over.
the thing is, no matter what we call heroin, it's gonna get sold.
the shit is strong, we're gonna sell it.
the shit is weak, we're gonna sell twice as much. You know why?
cause a fiend, he's gonna chase that shit no matter what.
it's crazy, you know?
we do worse, and we get paid more.
the government do better, and it don't mean no never mind.
this shit right here, Dee, it's forever.
that's your bonus right there.
and you buy something that you wouldn't otherwise.
Thanks, man.
all right.
you remember me?
do I remember you?
I was in here the other day, you wanted a drink.
did I get a drink?
afraid not.
then why would I remember you?
you want to be remembered, you going about it the wrong way here.
all right.
the usual.
this here's my uncle's place.
you kin to Orlando?
no.
Orlando's like the up-front man, you know?
my uncle's the money man.
where you from?
right here. Baltimore.
I know Baltimore, but, like, where?
you know Turner Station?
down past Dundalk, near the Point.
the Point.
so, you're a country girl.
you mean county.
where I'm from, the county is the country.
where is that?
so...
are you working with your uncle?
I'm his right hand.
Yes, you is.
you want to ride with us in the van?
no.
why not?
you think it's a waste?
touts and children, that's all you're gonna get.
bingo.
where did you get this?
now, look at this piece of shit.
I'm good to go, right?
come here, let me see.
detective Sydnor's ensemble.
it's the latest in Westside Project wear.
have your torn cammies by Versace...
stained sweatshirt by Ralph Lauren.
where you miked?
down in my dick, man. I figure they ain't gonna go down there, right?
I don't know, Sydnor, the way you twirling around...
might be the first place they look.
fuck you.
I ain't showered in two days, I ain't shaved in four.
right now, I am one ripe, nasty son of a bitch.
Bubbs.
what you think?
this your man?
Yeah.
is he low-bottom enough for you?
clothes is tore down enough...
but he could use a little bit more stains, more dirt.
what's this here, man?
it's my wedding ring.
shit, you married to the needle, boy.
that shit been pawned off, if you for real.
it's a dead giveaway.
you could stand to lose about 20 pounds, some yellow in your teeth...
fresh bleeds on your hands.
okay. So maybe I should go out and shoot up dope for a year or two, right?
come back when I can carry the look off?
I'm just saying, man.
the more tore down you look, the better.
you going down in them towers, they gonna check everything.
how about the shoes?
I know you ain't got no problem with the shoes, fucked up as they are.
let me see the shoes, man.
see?
you walking down them alleys of the projects you stepping on the dead soldiers.
dead soldiers?
Yeah, empty vials.
you can't walk down a Baltimore street without them cracking underneath your feet.
you want to know if a fiend is for real...
check the bottom of his shoes.
okay.
have him dance on some empties before we go out there.
get us killed.
he hurt your feelings?
a little bit.
shit.
four hand-to-hands...
two to me, two to Bubbs, with me close enough to mark it.
from who?
kids, mostly. Young-ass hoppers.
it's a start.
they're pretty tight out here, Kima.
if you don't hand no money to nobody that matters...
you don't get no product from nobody that matters.
you want to go back in?
shit, we copped from every crew out here.
ain't we supposed to go off somewhere and fire this shit up?
Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.
well, now.
did you get to see where the money went after you handed it off?
no.
nothing but touts and runners here.
but then again, you told us so.
I didn't say that.
but as a matter of fact...
everyone else roll out?
I...
you were upstairs and out of pocket, so I cut them loose.
just as well. I'll give them the news tomorrow.
what happened?
I told the Deputy we had a few hand-to-hands.
low-level people.
he wants us to put everything into search-and-seizures and hit the projects Wednesday afternoon.
lieutenant. - I know.
does he think that's what gets us Avon Barksdale?
the buys we made, they don't even go past the courtyards.
scratch together everything we got from the hand-to-hands...
and shape it into PC for the warrants.
a few locations, at least.
but we don't even know what doors to hit.
a few apartments in the low-rises that we've seen used for stash.
then we write on those.
lieutenant, these guys change stash houses every other day.
look, the man upstairs wants to see a circus.
a couple of days from now, I got to show him three rings.
Christ.
I'm sorry. We gotta jump.
what, is the Deputy Ops stupid?
no.
this shit is fucking stupid.
not if we bring in some arrests he takes them to the judge, he figures the judge goes away.
and then he buries the fucking case.
what are we gonna do?
there's nothing you can do, except pound out some probable cause.
we're gonna be here all fucking night. - I'm not.
where the fuck you got to go? - No, I mean, I can't.
I'm not gonna help them gut the case. I'm sorry.
I know he's your lieutenant. You gotta do what you gotta do.
but I can't swallow this shit anymore.
why are you here?
I'm thinking about something.
can I come in?
no.
no?
what's the matter, McNulty? No one ever tells you "no"?
sorry. I should've called.
how do you clone a beeper?
what? - That's what I need to know.
you show up at my door at 9: 00 to ask me that?
they're using pagers, right?
every other drug dealer has a cell phone, and these guys are all on pagers.
what do you want to do?
bunk and me, when we jack up the Barksdale kid...
he's got a Motorola pager.
we give it back, so as not to spook him.
you want to clone it?
can we do that without a subpoena to the pager company?
read that.
what is it? - Affidavit from a state police case.
a judge signs something like that, you can clone a beeper.
Christ.
probable cause, coupled with an exhaustion argument.
you've got to show the judge that other investigative methods have failed.
you'll also need a supervisor who wants you to clone a suspect's pager...
knowing that it might lead to who knows what else pen registers, wiretaps.
Daniels will come around.
Daniels will have your ass.
Thanks.
that's it? - What?
no.
let me understand.
you're married, and a date's a room at the Best Western.
now you're single, and a date is you coming over unannounced to learn the legal requisites for a pager intercept.
pretty much.
no.
okay, I hear you.
you?
you?
as if you give a shit.
you're an asshole, McNulty.
what the fuck did I do?
how much more to that pack?
50, 60.
Re-up's late.
have Wallace hit Stinkum on his pager again.
you want something from carry-out?
Yeah, lake trout sub.
pay up.
damn.
you asked, I thought you was treating.
you thought wrong, I ain't no bank.
you stingy like one.
just make sure you give me enough. - yeah.
no mayo, extra hot, something to drink.
all right.
he's going for food? - Yes.
why didn't you tell me? My stomach's growling like a motherfucker.
starve, nigger.
man, shit.
Re-up's here.
stink, what up?
what's up, bro? 10 minutes.
10? All right. - Yeah.
who's there?
y'all got my back, you heard?
get the fuck in there.
get your ass down.
sit your stupid ass down. Get the fuck down.
shit, stay there, bitch.
get down, get the fuck down, motherfucker.
where it at?
ain't nothing here.
??
where it at, man?
shit!
fuck, my leg!
where it at, shorty?
kitchen, under the sink.
go on and get that.
two G-packs. Let's roll.
just two?
come on. - What the
stupid.
shit!
let's get the fuck out of here.
shit!
come on, Poot.
fuck!
so, your man saw them get jacked?
Yeah, part of it.
and he gets the tag number?
good man, that Bubbles.
listen up.
WESTERN uniforms will meet us in the Mount Claire parking lot.
we start there, and we don't stop until we take the doors.
I want their lookouts to have as little chance as possible.
what's with you?
my office.
I'm not going. - You're insubordinate?
I'm not jumping out on something that will harm the case.
you want to write me up on that, you can.
you think I want this?
I got the Deputy Ops on my ass for this shit.
now you show me up in front of the whole detail.
I don't mean to show anybody up.
get your vest on. - No.
I got police work to do.
if you felt this way, why didn't you call in sick?
I'm not sick.
Yeah, you are.
give me a 95 on why you are physically unable to participate in today's action.
what, I'm gonna lie so you can save face?
come on, write it up.
I can't jump out with my unit because my tummy hurts.
I'm not gonna help you gut this case.
if you want to pretend to be police, you go ahead.
let's do it.
I'm up.
you're on medical.
I'm up, boss.
give him a vest.
no, motherfucker.
it ain't just up to Stinkum to be muscle.
you got the Pit.
your people supposed to be ready for the re-up.
you supposed to be steady for him.
but where you at?
you in the goddamn sandwich shop.
you got $20, 000, Dee, coming into your shop...
and you ain't even around to see that shit right.
look, I thought re-ups-- - No, thinking was what you wasn't doing, and now we look like bitches. You feel me?
we got to come back on them.
and you can't even tell me shit about who they was.
one of them was named Omar.
Omar, that's the name I heard.
and they had a white van.
Yeah, I saw the van
what kind of van?
Five-zero.
wrong door. - Yeah?
Yeah, switched it yesterday.
let's see your hands.
get out of the way. Let's see your hands.
up, motherfucker, up. Turn around.
all the way up.
police.
put your hands up. Put them up!
turn your monkey ass around. Put your hands at your back.
why you fucking with us, man?
come on, man, damn, I wasn't even doing shit.
come on, man.
cuff that one, and that one.
motherfucker, how's that feel?
you fucked up now.
you feel it, right?
??
why you ain't swinging?
motherfucker.
go ahead, play that cowboy shit, motherfucker. go ahead.
hold him down. Hold his arms!
spread your legs. Don't make me kick your ass, too.
come on!
get him.
you don't hit a cop.
what's wrong with you, boy? You don't hit a cop.
if you'd been here earlier, you'd have seen a beating.
clean. Not a fucking thing in there.
pick any door in the low-rises. What are the chances?
channel 2 wants to know if she can film some of the places we raided.
she says whatever we got, she'll put on film.
whatever we got?
drugs, weapons.
we ain't got shit.
I can tell you were never in patrol.
right.
sorry I'm late. - What's up?
I didn't want to tell you in front of the girl, her being from Narcotics and all.
Daniels is dirty.
what?
the guy running your case, he's got dirt on him.
you know this?
your own agency came to us with concerns about him last year.
integrity questions.
they didn't want to go to lnternal Affairs.
that office leaks like a sieve.
plus they couldn't handle a case if their lives depended on it.
that, too.
you looked at Daniels specifically?
we did a two-month assets investigation.
the man has a couple hundred thousand more in liquid assets...
than any police lieutenant should ever have.
maybe he goes to Atlantic City.
seriously. You look at his background?
maybe he's got other sources of income.
maybe ? we never got the chance to go further.
why not?
we went to your Deputy for Operations and told him what we had.
you took it to Burrell?
he says, "We'll take it from here."
so, we backed away and waited for something to happen.
and waited.
that was a year ago?
maybe more.
and that fucker's still the Supervisor for Narcotics.
so, you tell me what the hell's going on.
anyway, if he's running your case, I just thought you'd want to know.
Thanks.
ain't working out for y'all, huh?
mars is the god of war, right?
planet, too.
I know it's a planet. But the clue is "Greek god of war.
greeks called him Ares. Same dude, different name, that's all.
ares fits. Thanks.
it's all good.
see, back in middle school and all, I used to love them myths.
that stuff was deep. Truly.
you're up.
state calls Omar Little, Your Honor.
faggot.
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth...
the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I surely do.
state your name for the record.
Mr. Little, how old are you?
about 29, thereabout.
and where do you live? -No place in particular, ma'am.
you're homeless? -In the wind, so to speak.
and what is your occupation?
occupation?
what exactly do you do for a living, Mr. Little?
I rip and run.
you... -I robs drug dealers.
and exactly how long has this been your occupation, Mr. Little?
I don't know exactly.
I venture to say maybe about eight or nine years.
Mr. Little, how does a man rob drug dealers for eight or nine years...
and live to tell about it?
day at a time, I suppose.
what do we know?
on Sobotka, very little. He seems to live within his means.
house in Glen Burnie, paid-off truck, modest savings.
credit history is okay.
there's no flash to him, nothing dramatic.
doesn't sound much like a money man to me.
or maybe he's hiding it.
the union is also a little threadbare.
they paid the taxes on union hall almost a year late...
and that was only after they got hit with liens.
looking at their books
you subpoenaed their books? -You don't need to.
IBS books are open to the Justice Department...
under the terms of a federal racketeering case...
that came out of New York five years ago.
we called Washington.
they sent us a copy of everything the Baltimore locals have filed.
the books show that there's less than a 100 checkers...
still paying dues to 15-14.
and that's down from about 300 in the '70s. They're hurting.
so where's all this money Valchek is talking about?
the IBS hired Bruce DiBiago to lobby Annapolis this session.
and through individual officers and union members...
they've paid about $70, 000 to various PACs...
and Democratic organizations in the last eight months.
they show any of that on their books?
no, we pieced that together from the campaign finance reports.
that's just what was in the names of the union officers we cross-referenced.
so, where's the cash coming from? -Drugs?
so far,
dnrs on the union hall phones don't show much.
union business and personal calls, but no beepers...
and not much in the way of cell numbers or payphones either.
what's with those hand-to-hands? Anything connect?
we're buying from a lot of white boys.
o'donnell Heights, Greektown, Highlandtown above the park.
but any port connections feel random.
the money comes from somewhere.
maybe it's what the checkers do.
I mean...
they monitor what comes in and out of the port.
that's what they do, that's their value.
they're bringing the shit in?
or they're letting it happen.
like that can full of dead girls.
they kept that out of the computer.
which is why we're gonna quietly do some work on that side of things.
Kima, Prez,
I want you to start looking at girls.
no problem.
if they're coming into Baltimore, who's working them?
are they club dancing, whoring? We need to plug into that circuit.
as for the rest of you...
Lester is gonna stay with the paper trail and with the DNRs...
looking for connections to the union money.
Herc and Carver... you guys keep working the drug corners near the port.
officer Russell here and Bunk Moreland are assigned to Homicide...
but for the time being they'll be with us...
running the port database, looking for any pattern involving contraband.
questions?
excuse me.
I'm Thomas. -Beadie.
would you like to go to Royal Farms, maybe get a cup of coffee?
right.
yo, I'm Thomas. You want a coffee?
listen, I was gonna ask her for her panties to make some soup with...
but I was afraid she'd take it the wrong way.
??? You were at the opposite end of the parking lot...
when the assailant drew his gun?
thereabout.
do you see the gunman who killed Mr. Gant anywhere in the courtroom today?
yo, what up, Bird?
for the record, you are identifying the defendant, Marquis Hilton.
it's just Bird to me.
and Mr. Little, you had seen him many times before, had you not?
Yeah, we jailed together down the Cut
objection, Your Honor. May we approach?
quite a witness, ain't he?
word on the street is,
omar ain't nowhere near them rises when the shit pop.
street said little cocksucker was over on the East Side...
sticking up some Ashland Avenue niggers.
that's the word on the street, huh?
trouble is, String, we ain't on the street.
we're in a court of law.
your Honor
objection is noted and preserved for the record, Mr. Levy. Move on.
thank you, Your Honor.
jurors will disregard that last comment from the witness in which he explained... where he had last encountered the defendant.
yes or no, Mr. Little?
prior to the shooting, did you know the defendant?
I knew the man, but wasn't like he was no friend or nothing.
so you would have no trouble recognizing him from a moderate distance... say 20, 25 yards in daylight?
no problem.
Mr. Little, do you recognize...
this particular weapon?
Yeah, that's Bird's gun, the . 380.
you've seen it before? -Bird always flashing that thing.
so you'd actually seen it before the day in question.
and on the day in question?
it was in Bird's hand.
when he shot at Mr. Gant?
Yes, ma'am.
bird covet them shiny little pistols.
objection, Your Honor.
and the boy too trifling to throw it off even after a daytime murder.
you're a lying cocksucker, man.
I'll rip your heart out your goddamn chest!
the defendant will regain control or he will be forcibly restrained...
and I will clear the court.
the witness's last answer is to be stricken and disregarded by the jury.
eton is my friend.
it's good to have friends meet, no?
that's from the Greek, meaning what?
no Greek. Israeli.
yeah?
cause you look Greek, no offense.
either way, I mean...
you have the chemicals?
I can get them, as much as you want.
when?
I was gonna do something this week.
there's been a problem, though.
what problem? -My cousin Ziggy.
he got into a beef with these East Baltimore guys.
drug dealer by the name of Cheese took his car, burned it...
now he's saying he's gonna dust Zig if he doesn't pay.
Yeah, malaka, right. Zig fucked up the package.
so, you bring us the chemicals, we pay.
then you pay your debt.
it was $2, 700, right?
now, this asshole is saying it's double.
$5, 400, you believe that?
first he takes the car...
and now he's jacking us around on the money.
you want, we kill him.
no.
that ain't it either, no. -Why no?
cause first of all, Zig fucked it up. He owes $2, 700.
and second, you kill Cheese...
and we're gonna have a fight with his people, right?
a year down the road...
some nigger sees my cousin coming out the burger shop...
putting gas in his car on Central Avenue, no questions, puts a cap in his ass.
he's smart, huh? Niko, smart.
look...
we don't have the muscle to go talk to this guy, make things right.
I was hoping maybe you do.
Mr. Little...
can I ask why you came forward in this case?
I told the police what I know.
were you offered anything in exchange?
like what? -Were you arrested?
were you going to be charged with a crime, and by testifying...
did the police agree to drop those charges?
no, man, it ain't even about that.
how many times have you been arrested as an adult, Mr. Little?
shoot, I done lost count.
enough, though, not to take it personal.
possession of a handgun...
possessing a concealed weapon, assault by pointing...
robbery, deadly weapon, possession of a handgun again...
followed by violation of parole on weapon charges...
followed by one count of attempted murder...
and use of a handgun in commission of a felony.
that wasn't no attempt murder.
what was it, Mr. Little?
I shot the boy Mike-Mike in his hind parts, that all.
fixed it so he couldn't sit right.
why'd you shoot Mike-Mike in his hind parts?
let's say we had a disagreement. -A disagreement over?
?? Mike-Mike thought he should keep that cocaine he was slinging...
and the money he was making from slinging it.
I thought otherwise.
so you rob drug dealers? This is what you do.
Yes, sir.
you walk the streets of Baltimore with a gun...
taking what you want, when you want it...
willing to use violence when your demands aren't met.
this is who you are.
why should we believe your testimony then?
why believe anything you say?
that's up to y'all, really.
you say you aren't here testifying against the defendant...
because of any deal you made with police.
true that.
that you are here because you.
you want to tell the truth about what happened to Mr. Gant in that housing project parking lot.
Yup.
when in fact you are exactly the kind of person who would...
if you felt you needed to...
shoot a man down on a housing project parking lot...
and then lie to the police about it, would you not?
look, I ain't never put my gun on no citizen.
you are amoral, are you not?
you are feeding off the violence and the despair of the drug trade.
you are stealing from those who themselves are stealing the lifeblood from our city.
you are a parasite who leeches off...
just like you, man. - ...the culture of drugs...
excuse me? What?
I got the shotgun.
you got the briefcase.
it's all in the game, though, right?
and with the economy, what it is...
you can really consider coming in 10% or 20% below asking...
and still feel competitive.
even on the Hamburg Street address?
Absolutely.
I have to admit, I like the house at 1501 .
although I didn't like the color of the whirlpool tub...
in the master suite bathroom. Magenta?
that's cosmetic.
if they want to make the sale...
they should have some amount of couth to change the color.
I know it's such a tiny point to harp on.
well. - Maybe you're right.
maybe we should just keep looking. We shouldn't settle for just anything.
and you think that there will be some new open houses this Sunday?
I'm sorry, what were you saying?
we're gonna keep looking. You'll take us around again on Sunday?
definitely.
okay then, see you Sunday, early. -Great.
thank you.
I'll see you then.
you are a child, you know that?
what do you want? -Dinner and a movie.
come on, stop it.
why not?
this isn't going anywhere, Jimmy.
dinner and a movie, then I'll walk you to the door...
and you tell me to go fuck myself like you should've done way back when.
how about I tell you to fuck yourself here and now?
then you can save that money for someone else.
come on, Elena. Come on, I signed all your damn papers.
give me another shot.
Friday. You pay for the sitter.
so how that D. C. game, man?
same as it ever was.
chocolate City, I ain't been there in a while.
call it Drama City nowadays.
otherwise, same old gogo. Same old Bamas.
same soup, just reheated, know what I'm saying?
if you need anything to make this happen, you gotta get it yourself.
I can't go through my people.
if Stringer Bell reaching all the way past Baltimore with this kind of work...
then we got a real mystery going on, don't we?
don't worry, no mistakes.
nothing that might come back on you.
you sure of your people?
my cousin up in there...
he on it. -All right.
I can't stand that gogo shit, anyhow.
ain't heard it live, then.
I know a club in Oxon Hill that would wreck y'all.
all right.
if I'm around the way.
so, how you doing?
nursing school right now.
good, that's good.
Lester's been pushing me, you know.
he does it, kind of without you knowing that he's doing it.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
?? He said that you would be by today to talk about the clubs.
about some girls, Russian.
or from that part of the world.
the ones on the circuit, yeah.
you should try this place called Nightshift down off of Holabird.
I have a friend who works there.
she worked with a bunch of Russian girls last year for about three months.
think she'll talk to me?
only if I ask her.
thank you, Detective, nothing further.
anything more on redirect, Miss Nathan?
no, Your Honor.
let's take 10 minutes and then run the closing arguments.
I have every intention of beginning tomorrow with jury instructions.
how'd Omar do? - You didn't see it?
not the cross. That bad?
you have no problem.
no?
to start, he wants you to pay $5, 400. Then we talk.
he says, "No, you pay just the $2, 700.
Yeah, I saw how you talked.
but you will not pay the $2, 700.
instead you will get the money for the car that burned.
yeah? -Yeah.
him we don't know.
but the one he calls boss, him we know.
you gonna sit there and pout?
I know you don't think I'm going down to that club just to look at pussy.
I know you know me better than that.
I ain't even looking. - Everybody's looking.
most of them women are dykes.
Cheryl, it's police work.
what, so that's supposed to make me feel better?
kima's out on the street doing her detective thing?
all that hospital shit, all that rehab...
all them promises-- - We talked about this.
no, you talked.
I didn't get a word in edgewise once you made up your mind.
where you going? - With you.
excuse me?
who knows? I might see a little something I happen to like.
so all of that's on the table?
there's money in the transport budget for the grain pier.
also, a bond issue that pays for maintenance dredging on the main shipping channel.
but not the canal? - Nope, not the canal.
for that we'll have to fight a little longer and dig a little deeper.
so says Frank.
I gotta say, for my money, we're lucky if we pull out the grain pier.
be that as it may, we spent the money and took our best shot.
hired a couple lobbyists, made some smart contributions...
paid for a consultant's report to argue against some of the environmental stuff.
it cost, but we're starting to see it.
so where y'all find the cash?
I've been robbing liquor stores, two a week.
seriously.
seriously, We got some help from the national office on this.
there've been some timely donations from a few friends here and there.
the point is, at the very least...
we're likely to see the grain pier back up by next year...
which means a couple hundred more ships a year, at least.
if. -And it's a big fucking "if.
if that Polack motherfucker-- -Hey.
no offense. If Krawczyk don't fuck us by throwing up waterfront condominiums first, right?
nat's right.
the back door threat is that Andy Kraw or some other developer...
gets enough last-minute votes to sink the rehab money for the grain pier.
those guys are looking at that location, too.
so we need everybody making phone calls.
let your legislators know that we're watching on this.
the money only goes so far.
now we gotta make some noise, right?
make some noise. -Okay, enough talk.
some of yours got ships to work in the morning.
the rest of yours need to be drunk. -I'll drink to that.
help from the national office, huh? Timely donations from friends?
watch your ass, Frank.
this is it? -Yeah.
just picked it up from the port administrator.
so what am I looking at?
the Atlantic Light on the day the can with the women was offloaded.
the boxes are containers.
this one's being offloaded and set on a chassis.
here's the time: 10: 31 hours.
see? It was moved to Lane L, Stack 6, Row 3...
by an RTG at 10: 37 hours.
RTG? -Rubber tire gantry.
so from ship to stack took six minutes.
that's the way it's supposed to work, but...
AQQZ," as in zebra...
check digit, seven.
that's the container number of the can with the women in it.
see that? It was never entered by the checker.
so as far as the computer is concerned, it no longer exists.
Sobotka says that that can happen when the radio waves get knocked down...
or when a checker inputs a bad serial number.
it came off Atlantic Light at 11: 26 hours.
and it doesn't show up in the computer again until 15: 12 hours.
I find it two hours after that.
so for nearly four hours, it's out on the docks, unaccounted for.
Sobotka says cans get lost all the time.
when they get found, they get put back into the computer.
you believe him?
no, not this can.
so what's the plan?
the database on this computer...
has records for every ship that berthed at Patapsco...
over the last two years.
we gotta go back through and find what other cans might've disappeared like that.
see if there's a pattern.
how many ships we talking about?
hundreds.
it ain't like I got a prayer of bringing this case in otherwise.
that's what I'm talking about.
all right.
what the hell is your problem? - Nothing.
Yeah, you look like you about to be sick or something.
I just can't look at them.
Prez, you ain't never been to a titty bar?
Yeah, sure. But not with women.
you're sure you're not gonna have a problem for talking to us?
I don't give a shit.
you friends with Shardene, all that matters.
besides, I'm from Westport, and I told them club owners straight-up...
I was here before them ho's got here...
and they better make sure I'm here after they leave.
so how long ago did they came through?
six months back was the last batch.
Russians, I think, but shit all sound the same...
when you can't understand a damn word, right?
who brought them?
club owner pays extra for them.
there was a woman...she was like the madam who handled the cash.
but I ain't get a name.
she Russian, too?
she was something. She had an accent.
so it's like, one day all Baltimore girls are at the bar...
and the next, what? All foreign girls?
that about right.
they was making so much money with them new girls...
they let some of their regular dancers go.
not me, 'cause I mean, I got clientele here.
but some of the others...
Where'd the girls stay?
where they told. Shit, they ain't here legally.
they don't know shit. They ain't got no family.
the men they got handling them are always with them.
right there to take them from whatever motel they use...
to the club and back.
right there when they need to get food, or go to the Rite Aid.
right outside the motel door when they up in them rooms with the johns.
anyone try to get away?
shit, I seen one of them get lit up with one of them stun guns...
for going down the block to get some dinner.
they barely let them girls go to the bathroom by themselves.
and if they see one getting too close to the johns...
that's when they move the whole crew to another town.
keep it so they don't get no help.
you up after the next song.
push my numbers then.
I gotta go get paid, honey.
you need anything else, you can call me.
help if I can.
I'll tell Shardene you said hi.
she must be doing good, to be out for so long.
she must've landed a rich one, right?
you her girl? -Yeah.
I wouldn't let mine come in here either without me.
these bitches in here are no joke.
thirteen of them.
they had about a third of that space hidden behind the fake wall.
a few flashlights, some junk food, some water.
a portable toilet they had to share.
and not enough air.
I'm going to schedule sentencing for the third week of next month.
anything else today?
your Honor, my client, having preserved the necessary grounds for appeal in the record, wishes me to state unequivocally...
that regardless of this jury's verdict...
he is the victim of wholesale perjury on the part of the state's key witness.
we ask that an appeal bond be set...
so that he can participate fully in this investigation.
an appeal bond on a conviction of first-degree murder?
Mr. Levy, get a grip on yourself. - Your Honor
not only will there be no bond pending sentencing...
but as far as I'm concerned...
the pre-sentencing report is a mere formality.
Mr. Hilton has been found guilty of killing a state's witness...
who testified in this very courtroom.
he did so in cold blood, and for pay.
unless the pre-sentence report indicates that he is, in fact the Messiah come again...
he will very likely be sentenced to life, no parole...
by a Baltimore judge who, for once in his life...
gets to leave his office feeling that his job actually matters.
Mr. Hilton, are you the second coming of our savior?
excuse me? - Are you Jesus Christ come back to Earth?
see you at sentencing.
was it good for you, too?
Mr. Little, this is good to get-out-of-jail-free one time only...
on anything up to aggravated assault.
why thank you, ma'am. - No, thank you.
a rare pleasure.
time for the ceremonial eyefuck.
come see me down the Cut, you punk-ass snitch.
I'll shove a shiv down your cocksucking throat!
you think on it, Bird.
you think on Brandon while you doing that time?
I'm gonna see you, man, I swear to God!
fuck that, I'll do you like a dog. - You really see him shoot the man?
you really asking?
but it's fucked because the man got to where he needed to be...
and she wasn't even worth it.
Daisy wasn't nothing past any other bitch, anyway, you know?
and he did all that for her and in the end, it ain't amount to shit.
fitzgerald said that there were no second acts in American lives.
do you believe that? - Man, shit, we locked up.
we best not believe that, right?
he's saying that the past is always with us.
and where we come from, what we go through...
how we go through it, all that shit matters.
I mean, that's what I thought he meant.
go ahead.
like at the end of the book, you know?
boats and tides and all.
it's like you can change up, right?
you can say you're somebody new, you can give yourself a whole new story...
but what came first is who you really are...
and what happened before is what really happened.
and it don't matter that some fool say he different...
cause the only thing that can make you different...
is what you really do or what you really go through.
like, you know, like all them books in his library.
now, he fronting with all them books...
but if we pull one down off the shelf, ain't none of the pages ever been opened.
he got all them books, and he ain't read near one of them.
Gatsby, he was who he was, and he did what he did...
and 'cause he wasn't ready to get real with the story...
that shit caught up to him.
I think, anyway.
sorry, homey.
you done with your trial?
all right then, let's take her on out.
tomorrow. I'm back with you tomorrow, Diggsy.
you got something else to do today?
Yeah, last bit of business.
this is your business.
this is retirement.
and after today, I'm retired.
talk when I say, not before.
Tovarich. - Serge, my nigger.
you're losing weight. - Shit.
you are down to nothing.
in this country, supermarkets are cathedrals.
I worry for you, buddy. - How your peoples, dog?
same, good.
you talk to the man about that other thing, right?
because I can get behind that business in a big way.
we will talk later. Now, another business.
right.
this the man with the raggedy-ass Camaro?
wasn't mine, it was my cousin's. It wasn't all that raggedy.
sorry. Nicky is with us. His cousin...
but family cannot be helped.
who you telling?
I got motherfucking nephews and in-laws fucking all my shit up all the time.
and it ain't like I can pop a cap in their ass and not hear about it Thanksgiving time.
for real, I'm living life with some burdensome niggers.
so what the fuck?
you ain't pay my boy Cheese, and Cheese ain't paying me, right?
I ain't talking about all the money in the world.
but it ain't like Cheese be in a position out on that corner...
to let your cuz exemplify shit, you feel?
the man cut you some slack...
and soon every fucking-up white boy be on his titty.
we wanna pay what we owe. The $2, 700 anyway.
we're gonna have it soon enough.
your man doubled it, though.
he also burned the car.
now the blue book on that Camaro was $5, 100.
now, let me understand.
you gonna come up in here, having fucked up a package...
asking me to tell Cheese, who you fucked it up on...
to pay you out $2, 400.
he gets to keep the Camaro.
just how good a friend is this motherfucker to y'all?
the Cheese ain't gonna be happy having to pay me back...
so I would advise y'all to give him some distance.
just so he don't come back on my cousin.
anyway, thanks for being straight on this.
fool, if it wasn't for Serge here...
you and your cuz both would be cadaverous motherfuckers.
I went through INS, customs, even the State Department. Nothing.
it's time, Jimmy.
you did what you could, right?
Yeah, fuck it, let her go.
this one to the anatomy board in the morning.
Jane Doe on the paperwork.
ain't right, Doc.
what the fuck ever is?
you leave it to Avon...
he's gonna get some years off your sentence.
no doubt, knowing Avon.
it's all good, D.
just show up, and say what Levy tells you to.
what the hell is wrong with you?
I'm asking you.
those hot shots, that was Avon.
I want you home, D.
you asked me to carry this. I'm carrying it.
this is mine, right here, right now.
boy, you ain't listening to me. I am telling you
ma. Ma. You remember we used to lived on Linden Avenue?
remember that house?
I was about 6 or 7 years old.
I was playing on the porch.
them twins came by, started picking on me, messing with me.
remember that?
I'm banging on the door, trying to get inside...
and you standing right there to open the door...
except you ain't letting me inside.
you told me to go back out there and fight them...
whether I lose or not.
remember?
they beat the shit out of you.
Yeah.
then you say to me:
boy, I might have brung you into this world...
but you the one who gonna have to live in it.
ma, I'm still here.
me. You gotta let me live like I need to live.
you tell Avon, Stringer, and Donette...
all of them, to leave me be.
all right, look, fuck y'all. I need a drink.
come on, we're almost through 2002. - No.
tomorrow is another goddamn day, right?
Yeah.
they look thirsty, a round on me.
yo, Mr. Sobotka, friend to the working man...
master of the game.
how many votes we get down in Annapolis tonight, Frankie?
been here long? - Since my hair was brown.
I was telling Chess about Benny.
Benny with the harelip? - That's a good one.
see, Benny was working the hole and he got hit with a shackle.
chunk of steel clocked him good, but he didn't tell nobody.
not until he came in here.
that's when Little Nose told Benny to call the union lawyer.
paul Sevel? - Yeah.
God rest his soul.
so Benny calls Paul.
me been hit with a 'ackerel," Benny says.
a mackerel?
you working frozen foods again?" Paul says.
no, 'oddamn it, a 'ackerel.
then he slams the phone down.
Other'ucker on 'is way over 'ere.
says he can't undertan' me.
little Nose says, "Why he wanna do that?
Benny don't talk no fucking better in person.
so that's it? Me and Cheese are straight?
Yeah, you're straight.
that there's $2, 400 for Princess.
she was worth more than that.
dolo. One for the bar, hon.
you win the lotto?
if my old man can do it, who the hell says I can't?
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Nick, when I'm flush, I'm flush.
we ain't gonna live forever, right?
next round's on me.
not for me, I'm gonna head out.
come on, Frank, belly up.
take a rain check.
and that one as well, huh? - Makes 22.
all on the Talco line.
all with Horseface Pakusa working the ship.
we're on it then.
you gonna call Bunk?
detective Moreland is indisposed.
you with Daniels and them?
no.
we just parked the computer down there.
we're orphaned, man.
orphaned? - Yeah.
rawls is talking like...
if I don't come home with 14 clearances...
I can't come home at all.
Lester, too.
Where's the love, Jimmy?
where is the motherfucking love?
so what's up with you, man?
nothing.
nothing, huh?
I'm done, Bunk. Bird is my last piece of old business.
I got nothing new.
I was trying for an ID on this one...
and I can't even tell you why.
just a way to pretend I was still a murder police, I guess.
who gives a fuck, right?
Elena and I are gonna try again.
shit. - I'm done fucking myself up, Bunk.
I am done.
come on, man, let's go home.
all right, man.
over here, shitbird.
what the hell happened to you?
I fell down. - How many times?
let's walk.
pop, I'm-- - Walk with me, Zig.
votes break for us, that pier comes back online by next spring.
more ships, more work.
Yeah, great.
what the fuck are you about?
what?
is that my son lighting hundred dollar bills like an asshole...
in a bar full of working stiffs?
what the fuck is that?
just a smile.
a smile? - Yep, a smile.
you wanna hit me again, Pop, go ahead, take a shot.
where you come by that kind of cash? You know you ain't had the days.
definitely not.
it's 'cause my father's in the union.
fuck that.
seniority prevails, Zig.
it's the only way to keep it halfway honest.
I know, I ain't complaining.
I wish I could give you more.
you don't think I want to throw you more?
you throw plenty.
it's just, Christ, Zig. If I'd listened to your mother, - she's the one always talking about-- - ??
it's cool. - You should do community college like your brother.
pop, don't.
you wanna know what I remember?
do you?
I remember you, and Uncle Jerry and Uncle Walt Pe-Pop...
all sitting around the kitchen table, talking shit about this gang and that gang...
who's better with the break-bulk...
who could turn it around faster, who's lazy.
always a fucking argument, right?
four Polacks, six opinions.
I remember when youse all went down to picket them scabs...
at Covington Piers...
how Jackie Taylor got run over by a police car...
in the middle of that whole goddamn mess.
I remember when the Paceco fell during that windstorm.
you remember, right? Killed Fat Rick dead.
Yeah, what else you remember?
everything. Everything.
so tell me, Mr. "Back ln The Day..."
what are we doing down here with the wharf rats...
in the middle of the goddamn night?
beats the fuck outta me.
every one of those Post-its is a can that disappears... when it's being offloaded.
the yellow slips, they show up again with legitimate cargo intact and are re-entered...
so you figure those are honest mistakes.
but the pink and the green, those cans never come back.
they stay out of the computer for good.
and the pink one, like the can full of dead girls...
they're all from the same shipping line, Talco...
and on all of them, the same checker, this guy Thomas Pakusa...
he goes by Horseface, he's the one working.
you went at him already, right?
we grand juried his ass, but that motherfucker didn't blink.
you wanna hit the head? Get yourself right, Detective?
no, I'm good.
the point is, we have a pattern here.
what they're doing eliminates almost all of the paper trail.
as long as they can get a truck past the outbound lanes...
and there's a dozen ways to do that, the only thing they leave behind is a little telltale in the computer.
a box comes off the ship, flashes for a few moments and blip then it's gone.
our target is supposed to be Sobotka, right?
I mean, on paper anyway.
what you're telling me is that it's better than a fair bet...
that he actually is a target in Bunk's murders.
maybe we can fold our investigation into yours, Lieutenant.
and put my ass in the air with 14 open homicides that might never clear?
the bosses wouldn't blame you for that.
I wouldn't shine either.
I'm using what we do with this detail to get a major case squad going.
I come up out of here with all those open files, it doesn't smell as sweet.
so what's the next move on this?
we clone the computer and start watching what's happening on the docks in real time.
shit.
yo, D.
just wine, huh?
I'm not drinking much anymore.
no Jameson's?
maybe a quick fuck with the waitress, then.
okay, I deserve that one, too...
even though I'm not doing much of that anymore either.
anything else? - I'm sorry.
I don't know where it still comes from. It's been a year.
you deserve to be angry.
what's the point, though?
how's work?
what, so we talk about everything in my life that pisses you off?
drinking, women, the work?
just trying to make conversation.
I retired.
excuse me?
it's boats, not bodies.
on a good day, I catch crabs and count seagulls.
that's not you. - It wasn't me.
it wasn't me not to drink, or dog around either.
a lot of things weren't me.
I want another chance.
how about a fuck for the road instead?
how you doing? - Okay.
you unload this, you gotta ditch trucks and trailers both.
make it look like it was a hijack, all right?
if you want, I will pay you straight...
or Eton can pay in heroin.
wholesale.
turn it around, you can make $60, 000 or $70, 000.
Nicky, he's offering, like, three, four times the value.
I'm out on this.
Nick, even if we walk it up to White Mike...
we can make $30, 000 or $35, 000.
Nicky, come on, man.
half in cash, half in dope.
Nicky, I can turn that package around, no problem.
no, Zig, I got it. - Nicky, you don't know
you hear me? I said I fucking got this one.
stay at home and watch cartoons.
let me handle this shit for the both of us, all right?
you fucking walking home or what?
Hey, girl.
what do we do with the day? - Me?
I gotta pick up the boys from the sitter.
okay, great.
they're gonna be coming back here. Michael has piano this afternoon.
no problem, we'll do something after that.
maybe we go by my place, pick up some things.
I don't want the boys to know that you were here.
it's gonna get them hoping.
so you need to leave.
look at this sorry shit.
motherfuckers not appreciate nothing that comes to them free.
I'll take it in the back. Maybe they got some duct tape to fix it.
d, right?
Yeah. You can't be in here now, man.
yo, man, y'all get any final calls this week, yo?
Yeah, we got some. - I didn't see any out there.
all right, give me a minute.
let me finish up right here real quick, and I'll go and get one for you.
Hey, y'all. - What's up?
I know you got my motherfucking cigs, yo.
you trying to curb me, yo? - Come on.
what's in there?
WMD. Got that WMD here.
I'm looking for what you had the other day.
this shit right here?
the other day you was calling it Bin Laden.
but now it's WMD.
it will mass destruct your ass.
so this the hi-test?
same shit, new name.
you be all right.
okay, get dressed.
I pressed you some clothes and laid them out upstairs.
and don't forget that book bag neither.
you got your chrome, young one?
I'll take mine.
y'all mind the crossfire, you hear?
let's go.
they coming up the alley! They coming up the alley!
they coming back!
aim for the chest, brother, you hear me?
slide up.
you get down on that floor and stay there, you hear?
you hear me, boy? - Okay, Mama.
come on! Come on!
fuck!
why you running? - What the fuck?
Oh, shit!
hit that nigger cold.
bitches!
why you hiding?
drama done with, boy.
you gotta get your bags and get yourself to school.
get in, damn it! Get in.
T. T. you hear me?
come on now. The drama's done.
get your bags and get yourself to school.
I told you, you gotta get ready...
No!
they're changing up?
looking for my La-Z-Boys. Five of them you got for me, right?
that shipment is tomorrow. - Got it.
that's what the Newkirk warehouse was giving us a few days back.
straight, to-the-point drug talk. No muss, no fuss.
now listen.
pyramid, Inc. May I help you?
you got them Davinas or what?
I'm told we no longer carry that line, sir.
between me, Kima, Herc and Carver...
we been sitting on that warehouse every minute...
since we followed that truck off the docks.
no players coming in or going out.
no drug-related traffic at all.
to top it off, Sobotka hasn't used his cell phone since.
we tipped our hand somewhere. - That second can, maybe.
the port police making a traffic stop on their cargo must've spooked them.
if that's what did it, we fucked ourselves over nothing.
they dumped that can as a misdelivery.
what? - They probably changed that up, too.
if they think we're onto them...
they switch the can themselves, just to be safe.
and it goes off the docks with some bullshit inside...
just to see if we pull them up.
which we did.
which I did.
no, they're not on us completely.
if they were, they'd be shutting that warehouse down and rolling out.
instead, they're just sitting inside that place, turning away calls...
waiting us out.
I, for one, am a patient motherfucker.
don't waste film.
I been here so fucking long that you're starting to look good to me.
anything?
the drugs go in, they gotta come out, right? I mean, what the fuck?
little late.
used to be When a 9-year-old kid hit the pavement...
a district commander would be there within minutes.
I guess we're living in a brave new world.
I was in Washington with Burrell when I heard.
D. C? What for?
Burrell took some district commanders down to DOJ with him...
pimping ourselves for a little grant money.
so what do we got?
nine-year-old in his bedroom...
catches a seeing-eye stray through the window.
dead? - Pronounced at University.
witnesses? - No one offering a name...
but the general theme is two crews arguing over the real estate.
we got casings from at least three different calibers on the ground.
we're gonna canvass hard, but your people and Tactical...
should hit the area drug corners and collect bodies.
fucking pointless.
we jack up enough shitbirds, this case can fall.
I ain't talking about that. I know the drill.
I'm talking about this whole mess.
been chasing this shit from one corner to the next like it's a plan.
hit the corners, Howard. Take scalps.
you'll feel better when you do.
you told us about WorldCom and the name change-up, right?
you said that... - I said change the name of our product.
I didn't say nothing about taking people off a corner.
look, we done changed the name of that weak shit so many times...
that don't nobody come down to the Towers no more.
and them Carrollton boys had it going on.
who shot the young one?
I don't know. I don't think it was us.
them other niggers was going wild, though, I mean...
you know, the cops...
are gonna have to bang some heads on this one.
they got to.
that means we gotta shut everything down until this shit pass.
that means the Towers, the low-rises.
everything gotta take a long fucking time-out!
I know, String.
I'm sorry, man.
let me tell you something, man.
this here game, it's more than the rep you carry...
the corner you hold.
you gotta be fierce, I know that.
but more than that, you gotta show some flex.
give and take on both sides.
you hear me? - Yeah.
all right, anything that fired a bullet out on that corner...
has gotta disappear, you understand me?
I'm not talking about the storm drains.
call that nigger Shamrock and drive all that chrome over to the harbor.
all right.
coming up.
I got people waiting on a package from me...
but Sergei says that until we're sure about the police...
we're not going to be doing that business for a few days.
your uncle, he is right to be careful.
but, Niko...
if you are going to be doing this, you should not be talking to us about it.
why not?
we are more, what you call, wholesalers.
I'm kind of small-time, huh?
you are not so big, but you're among friends.
call that number.
talk to him.
this White Mike?
you know him?
from Curtis Bay.
I went to Southern High School with the guy.
you are with us now, so...
he will be fair. No problem.
now, for the rest of our business...
we will disappear these containers.
all of them clean.
take them to Newkirk Street.
if there is a problem, they will stop the trucks...
or we will see the police.
if not, no more worries.
all right.
we are off the warehouse phone now?
all day yesterday, I was giving the new number to our people.
this is bullshit.
if they were onto the truck, then they...
they would've searched it, no?
Five-O!
where you guys going?
come on, you know the deal.
get the fuck up against the wall! Hurry up!
come on, keep moving.
get him. Down. Down. Down
this is bullshit, man. You know I ain't did nothing, man.
everybody gets the special downtown at central booking:
one baloney sandwich and one white milk.
just shut the fuck up. - Man, I'm clean, you hear me?
what are you doing in the Pit then?
saying no to drugs.
don't just say no to drugs, motherfucker.
say, "No, thank you."
put your fucking head down, step up and get in.
sit down right here, stupid. Watch your head going in.
slide over, asshole.
shame a kid had to get killed before we got around to doing this.
what exactly is it that we're doing?
young boy killed over bullshit.
now you got the police crawling all the way up your ass.
it's a good day to be an Eastside nigger, I gotta say.
thing is, it ain't gonna happen like that if I take you up on your offer.
I'll be out there selling that real.
my boys ain't gonna be scuffling.
they ain't gonna be scuffling or standing on nobody's else's corner, starting no shit.
you're Westside.
you must've heard of Charlie Sollers, right?
no.
goes all the way back to Franklin and Fremont.
I mean, all the way back to the '60s and shit.
Sollers? - Sold heroin like it was water.
I mean, the motherfucker made himself some money.
I don't know who the fuck you talking about.
I know you don't.
and the police don't.
and the stick-up boys wouldn't have a fucking clue either.
cause Charlie Sollers just sold dope.
no profile, no street rep.
just buy for $1, sell for $2.
sometimes, when your back up against the wall, you go to the gun.
I know. I been there.
but you ain't gotta live by it.
avon's a soldier.
that's who you want with you when the shit fly.
but as far as business go...
you still got that connect?
right off the boat, String.
all right.
I'm gonna buy from you at the price you paying...
and I'll let you walk that shit straight in the Towers.
you can have 734, 770 and 221.
I keep the other three.
how you gonna tell it to Avon?
it makes sense, don't it?
he gonna hear something when it makes sense.
right?
no shit.
I thought you was in with Nicky.
fuck Nick.
he said you was his other half.
I don't want his fucking money.
I mean, that's drug money.
and fucking drugs are bad, right?
I mean, you gotta consider what that shit does to the community.
you spent all last year fucking around with White Mike. You remember that?
a man can grow.
besides,
I got a caper in mind that is gonna put that horseshit to shame.
I mean, I'm telling you.
you want in?
what do I gotta do?
what a longshoreman does best, Johnny.
zig, your duck won't touch the Pikesville rye?
he drinks mid-shelf. He don't like that rail shit.
fuck if I wouldn't give my right leg for a shot and a beer.
new Charles in the house.
moving pretty good. - Waiting on a prosthetic.
you got a decent lawyer?
Oh, Nat Coxson hooked me up through the union.
what's with the duck?
thing is you know you gotta let go of your name.
say what? - Yeah,
new Charles don't work no more for a one-legged fuck.
Yeah, maybe "Stump."
you know what? "Peg."
new Peggy.
how about "Tilt"? - Tilt?
tilt. Just like a pinball machine.
tilt. I like that.
uh, yeah, I called a couple of nights ago.
told you I might be in town tonight, remember?
so, this is your first time?
Yep, first time for me.
what do you do, Jimmy?
are you the police?
do you work with the police? - No. Christ, no.
no, I'm a traveling salesman.
I travel and, you know...
where do you live?
I'm not gonna tell you that.
I live out of town.
I'm sorry. I don't think we can help you tonight.
thank you.
you sucked.
I mean, really.
fuck if I thought I was gonna be interrogated.
I mean, Christ, I'm just a guy looking to get laid, right?
Hey, fucknuts.
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Christ, Ziggy.
Jesus, Zig. What the fuck?
what's up with my cousin?
don't even talk to me about that asshole.
drank himself to death. - Oh, shit.
what kind of fool would give a duck whiskey anyhow?
that boy ain't right.
and his fucking bird couldn't hold liquor for shit.
La-Z-Boys?
and Davinas.
male and female.
dope and coke. - What the hell is a Davina?
it's like a love seat, kind of.
any line on weight? - All whole numbers.
no halves, quarters, eight-balls?
ounces?
what kind of numbers they putting on the furniture?
nothing much above five.
proposition Joe has Ashland all the way up to North.
ten corners, easy.
five ounces wouldn't last him past lunch.
it's kilos.
we're on the main stem.
so what was coming and going last night?
not much.
no trucks in, some cars in and out...
but none of the drug players we saw rolling up there before.
whatever was in that last truckload probably went out in car trunks.
they're doing their distribution somewhere else for now.
which is why job one is to get back to a good phone.
the same PC that got you on that warehouse phone...
will get you anywhere else you want to go.
all we need is the new number.
verizon running any new lines in there lately?
we talked to the phone security people. They say no.
probably going to a cell phone.
best bet is to get the new number off the Russian's cell phone.
okay, then.
Freamon and Prez, stay on one shift in the wiretap room.
bunk and Russell, man the other.
Herc and Carver, you guys are on Newkirk Street waiting to see if the warehouse traffic picks back up.
mcnulty and Greggs have a line into the prostitution ring.
but so far, the people handling the girls...
have been a little cautious about fresh johns.
so we're gonna need a new angle there.
questions?
what was your play with those girls?
out-of-town salesman.
how far out of town?
what do you mean?
the farther out of town, the more they believe.
less like a cop you sound.
you do any accents?
english, British, Scottish, something like that?
crikey!
I was looking to get a little hanky-panky...and this one bloke gave me this number to call when I got across the pond.
work on it, son. work on it.
$200, 000?
that isn't a quarter of what they owe.
they say they will pay another $200, 000
once their shipment clears the docks.
and then?
that is all.
these Colombians are without honor, Spiros.
they are cheats.
the chemicals we sent are good, no?
no complaint.
they say they want more, even.
and they understand that we can guarantee their product gonna clear Customs?
right.
and still, they try to chisel.
Why?
what are they thinking?
that it is all profit for us.
that we will settle for half of what we agreed...
because $400, 000 is still a lot of money.
the Greek will be angry.
this is business, Eton.
the Greek?
he will be smart.
Jesus.
you accidentally shoot one 9-year-old in his bedroom...
and the whole city gets its undies in a bunch.
to err is human, that's what I like to say.
the mayor went to the scene for the cameras last night.
said the crime will not stand.
Yeah, we tell the mayor we're still working without an eyeball witness.
how about the street talk?
I got some mentions of a 17-year-old with the streetname Bodie.
narcotics has him as Preston Broadus.
and why is young Preston not being hurled with great abandon around one of our interrogation rooms?
we got cars on his grandma's as we speak.
what the fuck you think you're dealing with here? Amateurs?
fuck Nick. This is my thing.
you want in, you gotta deal with me.
all right, I got S-Class and SL-Class Benzes.
Roadsters, sedans, cabriolets.
I got them brand new, with the keys in the ignition.
nothing stripped.
off the docks?
no shit, off the docks.
what the fuck do I look like, a fucking car dealer?
twenty on the dollar. but...
if we're gonna do this,
I'm gonna need you to order a minimum of three.
or else it ain't worth it for me.
now, base price on an S430 starts at $73, 000.
you round it, I get...
$15, 000 for each car that you want.
a stolen car is a stolen car.
without title, who is going to pay even $10, 000 for it?
sure, in Baltimore, maybe.
but where you're from...
I'll bet you got family that don't give two fucks...
whether or not an American car got a title on it.
man, it would be a sad state of affairs...
if an international entrepreneur such as yourself...
didn't know what to do with a couple of extra Mercedes.
big night for Jimmy McNulty.
or should I say James Cromwell of Knightsbridge
excuse me?
Cromwell was the English fuck who stole my ancestors' land and the other ones are all from rock 'n' roll songs.
anyways, 10: 00 tomorrow night...
the shuttle comes for me on the parking lot off Russell Street.
good work.
we'll get Greggs to wire you up and set the surveillance.
shame we're not up on a good phone right now.
be nice to tickle the wire when we raid the brothel.
a little luck, maybe we get back up before then.
one other thing.
I'm bothered that a Russian immigrant this deep in dirt...
doesn't have anything in a law enforcement computer.
you still got that friend over in Woodlawn?
I'd like to know what the FBI has in its database.
well, after that meeting on the Barksdale case...
I made a point of pissing him off, remember?
so what? You do that to everybody.
this is George Glekas.
he's the cat who owns the appliance store where that second can landed.
run his ass, too.
why not just cut another guy in and run them out the bobtail lane?
these babies start disappearing and everybody on the terminal is gonna suspect an inside job.
we're gonna need bolt cutters for the fence...
and then we're gonna need enough wood beams...
to make a track across the grass onto the road.
why bother? We can run them cars over that little patch of grass, no problem.
that ain't the plan.
I just saw a can disappear.
Talco line? - Pakusa working it?
it's him. Do we try to follow?
we know where it's going, right?
12-08, you copy?
12-08, what's up?
we got a can that might be coming to you off the port.
can number: Paul-Mike-Quebec-Victor...
check digit two.
what do you want us to do with it?
see if it arrives.
and if it does?
see what happens then.
you wanna know something, Carv?
I'm starting to think that as criminal investigators...
we're not really respected.
that ain't necessary, Jimmy.
I knew we were fucking the dog on that Barksdale thing.
who do I tell?
we got this new ASAC, thinks it's all about loyalty and ass-kiss.
and believe me, this ain't like your agency.
you piss them off, you ride the boat.
Here...well, you come into work one morning, you find yourself assigned to some fucking dustbowl Indian res in Arkansas.
still, I was out of line, Fitz. - Fuck it.
what you got there, brother?
white boys. A different look for you.
funny thing is, they're all showing clean.
what's the chance of that?
anyways, NCIC and NADDIS are a dead end.
customs had a little intel on this guy, Glekas.
you said Customs had intel on him?
should show here.
let me try something else with it.
this'll give us any contact your boy might have had with us, agency-wide.
got something out of San Diego.
on Glekas? - We'll see.
geez, I make a long distance call to Hyattsville...
I need three forms and a lieutenant's approval.
Yes, Agent Ernest Koutris, please.
believe me, we ain't short on paperwork here either.
agent Koutris?
not much to it.
we pulled his chain in a stolen goods case I worked in '95," '96."
he was just crumbs, so no charges. But I did an interview.
the guy struck me as just a mope playing it slick.
Yeah, if you want, I can send you what I got.
all right.
if you need it, let me know.
we need to talk.
anyone following?
no
run up and down the street.
take tag numbers from cars.
all week I've done it. Nothing. - Again.
the truck is here.
Lester, it's here.
they offload anything?
not yet.
okay, wait on it.
see, the thing about it, Preston, is that you're unbelievably stupid.
you are.
I don't say it to upset you. Just to state a fact.
he doesn't think so.
nobody ever thinks they're stupid. It's part of the stupidity.
we don't even need you to tell us what happened on that corner.
we know what happened.
we got you, we got your guns, we got the whole fucking story.
where that lawyer at, man?
see, you just fucked up.
way you looked at the bag, you know what's in there, don't you?
that's you, right there, fucking up.
I don't know what you talking about. - No, you fucked up.
we even got your prints on one of the guns. We even got that.
which one?
that's you right there.
lawyer.
they were asking about me?
San Diego.
San Diego was a long time ago.
our friend in Washington does not know why.
only that the people asked.
you told me the police looking into the women were local.
they were.
no FBI.
we've been running only clean containers?
Yes. And no one watches, no one follows.
no one stops anything.
and we changed the warehouse phone?
a day or two more, and we are back to business.
we watch, we are careful. But we are back to business.
you will have to do a favor for our friend, no?
fair is fair.
the Colombians, I think.
they take our chemicals and pay less than promised.
down there, I understand everyone is a terrorist now.
judges are killed. Bombs go off in the street. It's very bad.
the Colombians who cheated us, they're not with the guerrillas.
they're trash.
the world is a smaller place now.
and the FBI cares very much about such things.
fair is fair.
Sergei's making a call.
if there is no problem, then bring in the La-Z-Boys.
I will meet you there.
recognize that voice?
that's the man from the warehouse phone, right?
that's the same guy? - Same guy, new number.
who you calling?
Pearlman, at home.
another affidavit, and we're back on the main stem.
shit is raw, String.
I mean, you can stomp on this motherfucker.
all right.
so, when them police stop busting heads up in them Towers...
you all let Prop Joe's people take hold of three of them.
all right.
okay, add the DNR stuff to the boilerplate, and you're there.
start connecting the dots...
and you have to start asking yourself what these guys aren't into.
drugs, women, stolen goods. All of them.
FBI didn't have much.
a little something out of San Diego on Glekas...
in a stolen goods case that was closed out.
San Diego?
these guys move around.
what's with the suit? - Date night.
the undercover at the brothel.
run like hell, ma'am.
we wanna be up on that phone, so we hear what we hear after tonight's raid.
who's the affiant?
can you get the SL-series in Pacific blue?
that would be best.
whatever you need, chief.
I don't give a damn about the color of this one.
whatever you have.
ain't a problem. They all just gotta have sunroofs.
it's a long story.
next Tuesday would be good for us.
a ship comes Wednesday early, so...
listen...
you think I can get an advance on this?
I got some expenses right now, and I'm a little tapped.
I'm just asking. - Payment on delivery.
Hey, don't worry about it, chief.
I would never even dream of cheating a smart businessman like yourself.
it ain't enough that I gotta be the one thinking this whole shit through.
that I gotta be the one looking out for this shit and that shit.
checking up on this, making sure this shit is done.
no, that's not enough.
that's why they be paying them fucking CEOs so much damn money.
because when the shit fall bad, it all fall bad on them.
everybody else can be ducking and hiding, doing what they fucking wanna do.
but when push come to shove...
I'm the one who's got to take that responsibility...
and you all are leaving me very little to work with right now.
hold up, String... - No, that's a very simple thing, my nigger.
very simple
you drive the guns to the water.
you look around, you ain't see anybody, you throw the guns.
in the water.
splash.
now, get the fuck out of here, man.
except you, young one.
you ain't say shit back there?
Oh, no. they fucked up when they told me my prints were on one of them guns, right?
and I wiped them shits down myself.
and the one they said was mine wasn't even.
and If they would've had anything past my name, they would've kept me, right?
all right. - All right, String.
lock that door.
you got a bolt cutter?
cause I'm gonna need a good one.
got two in the window there.
you hung this on a duck?
of course.
1200.0
fair enough.
Nick. - It's been a while, Mikey.
Yeah, it has.
but your name has been...
ringing out in my mind lately.
Oh, Yeah?
my man called.
said you was gonna take a re-up from me.
Yeah, that's what they told me, too.
Nicky Sobotka, living the life.
who fucking knew?
so how much you looking for?
two or three G-packs a week.
I was getting that shit from the Greek's people.
four each. - Four?
I wholesale for five, man.
I don't know.
they told me you were gonna be straight with it. so...
what up, dawg?
I got a friend of yours here says we're giving Gs at four.
yeah?
all right, fuck it. Yeah, it's fine.
another thing.
I wanna know it wasn't your people...
dropped that body over on Potee Street the other night, you know?
I'm asking 'cause it was someone with some Greek-ass name...
and fuck if he wasn't dumped in front of a house I was using.
did he have hands?
did he have a face?
yes?
then it wasn't us.
idiot.
you got friends in high places, Nicky.
four a pack for you. - All right, cool.
thank God for the Russian's cell phone.
they might be laying off the warehouse line, but at least he ain't changing that up.
did he have hands? Did he have a face?
yes? Then it wasn't us.
what the fuck is that?
it's a man's purse.
european men like yourself sometimes carry one.
them people ain't right over there.
the mike has to go somewhere.
besides, you might have hands all over you before we get what we need.
indeed I might, luv.
it'll be your call when we come through the doors.
you want us in, you say...
what was it?
spot on.
it means "exactly."
and remember, they have to bring up the money and the sex first...
then an overt attempt to engage.
spot on.
detective Freamon with Baltimore Homicide.
listen, what do you guys have in VICAP for male victims...
headless or faceless, and missing both hands?
middle Atlantic region probably.
$4. 5 million in the capital budget that's set to pass House and Senate both.
money'll be allocated for the fiscal period next year.
congratulations, Frank.
what kind of stevedore drinks champagne?
so, Nat, about the election.
I just need one more year to bring the dredging home.
that's what I need.
Ott's turn, Frank.
this is Agent Koutris of the FBI down in Washington.
he's with the counterterrorism people down there.
terrorism? - He needs our help tonight.
11-34, what's your 20?
I'm at the overpass on Wicomico.
copy that.
okay, we're on here.
good evening.
paint pigments.
they ship them in for the SCL plant down at Fairfield.
it's in there somewhere.
run it.
same consistencies on all the barrels.
nothing else in there, really.
nothing but the pigments.
what's going on?
I don't know nothing, Horse.
swear to God.
tonight, I'm just a dumb white boy from Locust Point.
you know, I'm saying this out of respect, Brie.
I love the man like he was my brother, but when it comes to something like this...
he gonna listen to you more than he listen to me.
you think so?
all I put in his ear about my son didn't do a damn thing, now, did it?
all them times I told him that he needed to do more for D'Angelo...
and what happened?
he feel for that.
he feel for you.
I know he didn't see it coming.
none of us seen it coming. - I did.
I swear, I saw it.
he ain't listen to me then.
why the hell you think he gonna listen now?
cause we got a weak product...
and we holding on to prime real estate with no muscle.
I don't got Wee-Bey,
Stinkum, Bird.
now look, I know that your heart is heavy.
I know.
but them wolves is at that door.
as long as them Towers are still standing,
I am, too.
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let everything we fought for go to shit.
so I'll talk to him.
Mr. Cromwell.
decisions, decisions.
would it be wrong to take two?
Attaboy.
we should get upstairs.
nothing but paint pigments.
trust me, old friend. It's there.
son of a bitch!
okay, then.
right.
maybe, we could talk about this first?
we...
any time you guys want.
the money changed hands, right?
sounded that way.
and they talked about sex?
definitely. - Any time you guys want.
hang on.
Oh, God.
is it soup yet?
spot something. Spot on it.
let's go.
whoa. Why?
we're supposed to take the door and get in quick.
calm the fuck down.
it ain't like they gonna flush a half dozen whores down the toilet.
who is it? - Baltimore police.
what do you want?
to lock your ass up.
hands. - Let me see them. hands.
two more in the back. - Come on, ladies.
you're late.
he okay?
he'll live.
...estimated at 1, 125 kilograms of processed crack cocaine...
is estimated to be in excess of $45 million.
federal officials have confirmed to Channel 6 News...
that their investigation is ongoing...
and that while no arrests have yet been made...
the seizure itself has severely disrupted the operations of a group...
believed to have ties to Colombian narco-terrorist...
now, that, gentlemen, is a case.
God forbid you two should put something like that on my friend, Frank Sobotka...
I would die happy.
our case is progressing.
great, what can you charge?
we're not at that point.
we've got wires into a smuggling operation that we've linked to both drugs and women.
and likely, they're the people who were bringing in the girls...
who turned up dead in that can two months ago.
now, we're on one location that we believe is a transshipment point for narcotics.
and last night, if you check the 24s...
you'll see that we hit a brothel we also think ties in.
a month or two more on the taps and DNRs...
and we will be able to identify the top-end players.
you hit a brothel?
waterfront condo, high-end.
Jesus.
okay. If you find anything that looks like a list of steady customers, flush it.
I mean, half the names in the Maryland Manual are probably on it.
any problems on the raid?
a complication or two. Nothing we can't write around.
immigration is holding the girls.
and the madam, who has legal residency, we cut loose after she posted bail.
you try to interview them? See if any will roll?
not while the taps are up.
better to let them think it was a random raid and see what's said on the wire today.
cut to the chase.
you any closer on my murders?
if these are the people who were importing those girls...
then, yeah, we're closer.
the more we learn, the more chance we have to clear those cases.
what about Frank Sobotka?
I'm not hearing his name in here anywhere.
the union may be involved in the smuggling...
but we're not getting a sense that it goes past that.
this is about Frank Sobotka.
the case is bigger now.
look, missy, this is my detail.
I started it.
now, I'm asking, do you have charges on Frank Sobotka?
charging Sobotka at this point would lose us the wire...
and a chance at the real targets.
he is the real target.
P-P-P-Patience, Stan.
I'm sure if they bring the case... - You owe me on this, Erv.
you asked for a detail,
I gave you a detail.
you asked for Daniels, I gave you Daniels.
okay.
so...
now the votes are in...
and you're moving your damn golf trophies upstairs to the commissioner's office...
now you're freezing me out, huh?
fucking rat fuckers, all of you.
this is my case.
mine!
and now you're gonna tell me who the target is?
not fucking likely.
he's saying no.
he's saying we fought for every one of them Towers...
and to give them up now would mark us as weak.
he's saying if we do this, Prop Joe would have it over us...
and we might never get out from under.
we don't have the product or the muscle.
I told him.
I did.
he say he still trying to find us a better connect.
and for muscle...
he's saying he sending us the best he can find.
brother Mouzone.
he sending in Brother?
from New York.
coming down to work on retainer, for as long as we need.
brother Mouzone?
Yep.
at which point the officer was unable to resist...
the ministrations of the aforementioned suspect...
and found himself brought to the point of a sexual act.
you're famous behind this, you know that?
as a pervert, this report is gonna make you a BPD legend.
I can't perjure myself. I gotta explain it somehow.
motherfucker, you have violated a half dozen departmental regs right there.
not to mention that no state's attorney is gonna even bring this thing into court.
we're not going to court. The girls are being deported.
we did the raid just to tickle the wire, remember?
there were two of them. I was outnumbered.
you fucking with me, right?
brother Mouzone, from NYC?
I went to Avon, told him I didn't have enough muscle to hold down them Towers. Played it like that.
Yeah, and he reached out.
Joe, I'm still holding on to this deal.
know what I'm saying? This is just some shit we gotta deal with.
deal with how?
my nigger, I would take the motherfucker out if I could...
but Avon can't know it came from his own people, right?
you don't think I'm gonna send any of my people up against Brother?
shit.
that nigger got more bodies on him than a Chinese cemetery.
true.
look, I'm just saying, this your problem, not mine.
you want my product, you need to deal with it.
all right, so listen, we got some time here.
avon gotta send up word and wait for word to come back...
set up a price, talk to Brother Mouzone, I mean, set up the whole shit.
and that's like a week or maybe two.
and by that time, your people's gonna be in the Towers...
and if the money's right, then that is what it is.
ain't no nigger from New York gonna change the facts from the ground.
all right?
12-08 to 11-37, you there?
11-37, what you got?
that last truck is on the move.
it sits there for two days and they don't offload a thing.
10-4. - They're testing us.
they been moving clean cans.
the trash hasn't drawn any flies. - No?
we just took out the last of it. No problems.
okay, then we go.
what about llona? - She is home. They kept the children.
there are always more children.
why don't we tap that cell phone, even if we don't know who we're tapping?
that call might just be our PC.
and this here is the little king of everything.
so how many we got in the sector?
double shift, plus the Flex Squad,
DEU...
and a dozen guys Tactical sent us.
we're on every corner.
pretty damn quiet today.
today.
let's go.
officer.
Yeah, shit is good. Here.
next time we re-up, though... tell Moe man we need about 700, 800 more of them dimes, all right?
I am not even seen shit like this since I don't know when.
same with the jumbos?
Yeah, better get more of those, too.
what the fuck is up now? String, what's up, man?
what up? Can't call it.
how's our package?
how's it look? Shit is good.
see these Eastside motherfuckers over here?
I want you to extend to these motherfuckers...
all the hospitality that West Baltimore is famous for. You heard?
Yeah, you want us to fuck them up? - No, dawg.
we're giving them 221, 734, and Saratoga.
we keep the rest. If anybody starts any shit...
they'll have to answer to me, all right? Directly.
you heard me, right?
all right.
what are these off-brand niggers gonna do with a project tower?
fall back, young 'un.
we're gonna show y'all motherfuckers how to grind out here, all right?
Hey, String.
I heard you, man, I did.
but this shit right here, it don't make no sense.
you like the new product we selling?
it make sense now?
where are we at with our Boss Man?
we should be up on his phone soon.
the PC is there, no question.
we get up on his cell phone, he's done.
we'll ID him, no problem. - I don't know.
they came down on that warehouse phone when we spooked them.
Sobotka's cell phone, too. We might be going up on a dead line.
this is the other way to go.
compared to the wiretap, it's the longer way around.
but still, if he's changing up on his cell phone...
over the last week or so...
we've not only confirmed the identities of some of the key players...
we've also got GPS trackers on all their cars.
first of all...
eton Ben-Eleazer. He's the drug Lieutenant in the warehouse.
E-ton. - Whatever.
our madam, Miss llona Petrovna.
george Glekas, who runs the appliance store over in Highlandtown...
and the probable fence for the organization.
we followed some of them in real time.
with this little toy here, there's something else we can do.
that's seven days of where our targets have been, sped up.
and lookit. Two locations only where three or four cars stopped at the same time for more than five minutes.
one "X" is a dive of a diner down on South Clinton.
the other is on the western shore of Fort Howard down past Edgemere.
we get up on these locations, maybe we get a photo of the Boss Man. Or a tag number.
it's totally cool. Where did you even get this stuff?
DEA for the trackers.
mcnulty pulled the software from his pals at the FBI field office.
we can pull Herc and Carver off the warehouse and give them the diner.
mcnulty, Bunk, you guys take Fort Howard.
what the fuck, Frank?
you might as well start posting them things, right?
I mean, shit, if you're gonna run, you might as well come out and say so.
it ain't personal, Ott.
I want to finish what I started with the dredging issue.
and you don't think I'm good enough to handle it.
it ain't about that, kiddo.
ott, listen to me!
what the fuck do you want me to do? Tell him where the money comes from?
I. B.S?
not to brag, but union racketeering is one thing the Bureau does well.
that is exactly what I wanted to hear.
this case needs closure, boys.
and in my heart of hearts...
I know you're the kind of bastards to put Sobotka where he needs to be.
one other thing you Federals can help me with.
and if you don't mind, a little discretion is called for.
that, right there, is the district surveillance van...
which was fully equipped when it disappeared.
a surveillance van? - Sobotka stole it.
now it's l-don't-know-where.
the last picture was from Seattle...
but I got prints...
from two other places, see?
you reported the van stolen, right?
it was my feeling that the theft of a vehicle from a departmental lot...
would reflect poorly on the department.
the thing is, I know you boys have got enough reach...
to maybe get the van back without no big dustup.
as a favor for me having brought you the whole case.
motherfucking Eastside need to get their asses back across town where they belong.
yo, man, we run them off, we run off the good dope so...
I'm just saying they all the time hustling around cutting prices and doing shit.
it ain't right.
walk, nigger.
yo, what's up, soldier?
looking maybe to do something here.
with him? This motherfucker?
I saw him over on Ashland last week selling burns.
fuck y'all, nigger. - Look, what did he say?
$25, two dimes and a coke kicker.
I'll give you two dimes for $15, plus the ice on top for free. What?
that'll work.
take it in the lobby. I'll be right behind you.
that's what's up, see? The game now is that we gotta sell more of this good shit than they do.
what? Get the fuck out of here!
you mean to tell me there's a Westside nigger...
who knows how to sell shit without sticking a pistol in a friend's face?
Yeah, dawg.
and you better get used to it. 'cause y'all ain't selling shit until we bone-ass dry. Believe that.
all right, nigger. Whatever, man.
all right, cottage-cheese, chest-ass motherfucker.
where do you want it?
there's good.
easy.
we could help you set it up.
you have a surveillance to cover?
I got that feeling again. - Like they don't think we're potty trained.
can I help you?
FBI. Lt. Daniels?
he's in his office.
without that billboard in my face, I wouldn't have known.
how could you have known?
there was the wingtips.
and the beady eyes. Definite giveaway.
tight asses. - Definitely.
lt. Daniels? Agents Settles and Mason.
maj. Valchek said you'd be expecting us.
you listening to this fool?
saying that the Eastside is wilder than Westside...
cause of some shit about Eastside folks drinking port wine...
while the Westside do sherry?
port make a man do crazy shit,
I'm telling you.
BUTCHIE, talk to this fool.
for me, leastways the difference between East and Weste goes back to one man: Frank Matthews.
pee Wee Matthews?
Yeah, the brother went up New York and got in bed with them Italians.
the only one from this town got a piece of that French Connection.
what the hell Pee Wee got to do with anything?
cause Frank was Westside.
how do you like that? The dope flowed West.
when you got a steady supply, you run shit like a business.
somebody gets hurt, there's a reason.
not like this foolishness we got today.
excuse me.
what say, Omar?
ain't no thing.
you know I got something for you, right?
wouldn't come around unless I did.
what up, Butch? How you holding up, baby?
except for fretting on you, I'm good.
it's for my people.
a little something for a rainy day.
you built up a right nice-size nest these past couple of years.
might be time you maybe think about backing off some?
back off to what?
later, Butch.
stay, boy.
damn, Zig, I ain't got it cut yet.
and turn that shit down, for Christ's sake.
nicely done.
like I always say, it pays to go with a union card every time.
turn the fucking radio down, Zig.
will you get in the goddamn car already?
for Christ's sake, we ain't got all night.
Jesus!
you could drive a tank through there, it wouldn't take a scratch.
where the fuck you going with this?
greece. Athens, Greece.
the hole is so they don't think it's an inside job.
so they don't look at the union.
welcome aboard, chief.
is that you?
I thought you were gonna go shopping.
me? - Yeah.
we round-the-clock with surveillance.
when do we get to the part where you do all kind of shit for me?
when do we get to that part?
so you past the point of lifting a grocery bag or two?
you try being me like this.
something wrong?
the baby's kicking.
wanna feel?
almost $4, 000. - I know it is.
the Greek guy, the one with the warehouse, pays me in cash.
keeps it off the books, so he don't have to pay taxes and benefits.
and you saved all that?
he gave me a bump, too. I'm pulling down $700 a week.
you don't believe me?
Christ.
I was saving that up to give to you for the new apartment.
you know what I'm saying, dawg?
but I don't understand how these hoes be acting sometimes and shit.
if I tell a bitch, I'm like, "Bitch, either you suck dick or you don't."
gentlemen.
what's up, my brother?
are you slinging bean pies up in here? You know what I mean?
you with the nation, homey?
cause either you're a Muslim...
or your momma need to stop laying your clothes out in the morning.
I'm here to represent the interests of a Mr. Barksdale.
are you familiar with Mr. Barksdale?
that name ring out, but so do mine.
and you are?
cheese, man.
Mr. Cheese. I see.
and who do you work for, Mr. Cheese?
who do I work for?
am I correct in assuming that you are not employed by Mr. Barksdale?
hell, yeah.
if that is the case, then I have to insist that you leave.
this nigger serious? - Let me be emphatic.
you need to take your black ass across Charles Street to where it belong.
what? - Hold on now.
he doesn't know what this is. It ain't what he thinks, you know what I'm saying?
first of all, we got permission to grind in these here towers.
second of all, I don't give a fuck...
get off me, get off!
pellets in plastic. Rat shot.
what you need to be concerned about is what's seated in the chamber now:
a copper-jacketed, hollow point...
120-grain hot street load of my own creation.
so you need to think for just a moment and ask yourself:
what do I have to do before this man raise up his gun again?
let's go.
good day to you, sir.
I'm in agreement with the agents' assessment.
as far as I can see. this case is an ideal candidate for RICO prosecution.
my agency agrees RICO is the way to go, so we'll be in your courthouse, not mine.
but I want one thing on record.
as of 9l11, the Bureau has one priority in this case:
it's waterfront corruption.
it's a new world and the ports are vulnerable.
this case is bigger than the union.
we're agreeing to take on the whole case, Lieutenant.
but the union is why we're in the room with you.
if you're okay with that, we can work the case together.
we'll copy all the Bureau's 302s to the Lieutenant and Miss Pearlman.
your paperwork should CC Squad 6 and my office, as well.
okay.
I'll start pumping your casework into our system.
see what leads that might generate.
oughtn't you be laid up resting?
a gunshot ain't nothing to trifle with.
shoulder does hurt.
but this here works just fine.
tell Stack to polish it up good and put $7. 50 on it.
shame to let a good toaster get away over a frayed cord.
first off, ain't anybody running up in them projects?
the Westside boys are hurting over this more than even you.
trust me, soon as our good shit run out, they fucked.
second, a whole passel of hard-ass hitters took a go at Brother Mouzone, and ain't lived to say shit about it.
we go at the boy, no telling what might get stirred up.
if Stringer takes a shot, he crosses Avon on it.
put a bounty on him.
let some bushwacking fiend back-shoot his ass.
I pin money on him, and first thing he come at me?
shit.
might as well just shoot myself now and get it over.
there is one boy who might could just pull this off.
only, he won't take contract money.
aim for center mass. Make sure the man goes down.
no problem.
I got the three on the left.
fuck you, assholes.
how you doing? - How you doing, buddy?
the Samsung S221. You got that?
I don't see it.
doing the old inventory, are we?
I hope there ain't been no thieving going on.
not like the problem we got down at the docks.
you get the cars off?
sailed two hours ago on the Caspia.
listed as scrap aluminum.
I got the bill of lading right here. - Not here.
in my office.
forgive me, but how am I to know.
you did not ship them empty?
I just don't know. Let me see.
maybe if I had a 4. 0 Megapix, three times optical, fully digitalized camera...
I could've taken some quality photos of them Benzes in those cans.
but oops. I forgot my camera got busted.
or you know what I could do?
I could get old Boris to skulk around them docks...
keep the old commie red eye on them containers.
make sure the dock boys are playing me straight.
they are what I order? - Yes.
I got you the S series in the colors that you wanted.
I even got one parked outside. You wanna see?
outside? Now?
I'm just taking her out for a spin, chief.
I'll put her back tonight.
wait one.
them cars list out at better than $60, 000 each.
20% was last week. Today, the quote is 10%.
still, it's good money for a few hours' work.
No!
no fucking way!
we had a deal, motherfucker. A deal.
you listen to me. It was my fucking ass out there on the line. Mine.
this piddling shit is the best that you come up with?
you don't play me like that. You don't.
fuck you, you thieving, Greek cunt.
Malaka!
you don't know that one, chief. But you know "malaka," yes?
now you know malaka with dress.
please.
malaka.
can you hear me?
if you can talk, please stay on the line.
get in the boat first, then put the preserver on.
it's easier that way. - Yeah?
y'all trying to drown my ass for sure.
come on.
don't push me, man.
rod.
got it.
here. Hold on to that.
I know this one.
stringer Bell will come at me with this.
says he's got something with Omar he needs to make straight.
didn't say what that might be?
wouldn't tell me.
and to be truthful, I didn't want to know.
no.
it doesn't feel right.
you know them Barksdale people ain't to be trusted.
no denying all you say is true.
but Stringer talking parley.
so your boy needs to think long and hard on this.
cause if Omar is living his day-to-day in the street...
there ain't no telling what their next step might be if there ain't no sit-down.
"Parley"?
that's all he says he's looking for.
I'll talk to him.
but if it feels funny to him the way it does to me...
I got a better chance of putting a leash to the wind, you know?
if you think it might help,
I can go protection.
they're the one got hurt the last time.
then there was a reason to meet.
this time feel different.
I hear you.
maybe Stringer's still trying to settle that beef behind the fact that he got to live in this city, too...
omar being Omar.
if it ain't putting you out none...
I'd feel a powerful lot better if my nephew took over protection.
typed and ready for your John Hancock.
Thanks. - Sure.
you just have to initial each page and then sign at the end.
I'm just checking. This is the official record, right, chief?
it's what's gonna play in court.
can I change something?
Yeah.
just put your initials next to your changes. It's no problem.
Yeah, it's only one.
you know, you typed "said"
here, see?
"Said"?
yeah
he wasn't
he wasn't saying, "Please don't shoot me."
it was more begging.
you know?
double G, he's begging me.
but that's not gonna mess you up, though, right?
no, it's more descriptive like that.
it's good. Thanks.
quiet. No one in or out of there.
it's kind of nice out here.
moonlight on the water.
waves lapping gently against the boat.
I'm working my regular eight. I can handle it, you know?
but a detail likes this...
that's what I'm asking.
if something comes up on the job, how would you handle it?
I mean, at home with the kids.
until now, not much came up.
but now, say something comes up.
I mean, say we do a raid or something.
what would you do?
I guess I'd try to get the sitter to stay.
maybe call my folks, like I did tonight.
you know how it is with kids. You gotta be there.
but you wouldn't miss it?
I mean, with everybody rolling out and you having to head home?
if it keeps going like this, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Thanks. - It's no problem.
you wanna make a phone call to someone?
if you get over to Madison, it might be some time before you can.
ain't a chance I get a bail, right?
how about family?
all right, to bring you up to speed, we've got agents in Le Havre...
shagging leads from the manifest of the Talco ship due here in a few days.
to see if we can't pinpoint the origin for the illegal containers.
that's a lot of cans.
a hundred and ten, actually.
how many agents you need to track back to where all those cans came from?
as many as it takes.
we may be assholes, but on the upside, there's an awful lot of us.
let me get this into the computer for the boys overseas.
anything from that shithole of a diner?
Herc and Carver had nothing overnight.
the feds took over this morning and it's still quiet.
I'm going back on the water.
one meet and we're on this guy.
the Talco line's in Wednesday.
I'll send Nick for a number.
the Greeks again? - Who else?
they sure do stir up the shit, them Greeks do.
uncle Frank. - Nicky boy, just in time.
uncle Frank. - What? What happened?
?? - What the fuck is it this time?
he shot...
they're saying he shot two of the Greeks.
last night, they're saying. - Shot?
he shot? - Fucking Christ!
he's locked up.
he's fucking charged with murder.
the Greeks? - Double G.
and one of the kids that works down the store on the avenue with him.
they're saying he walked in there.
he went in. - Why was he there?
where the fuck were you? - Uncle Frank, I didn't know.
what didn't you know?
what is Ziggy doing near the Greeks? - I don't know.
you don't know? You're supposed to. You're his fucking cousin!
you're his father.
1, 125 kilograms.
not that drug enforcement's my cup of tea...
but I'm told it was the largest crack seizure on record.
I just wish I had good news for you.
you told me this was a local effort.
it's sprawled. Now the Bureau's involved.
we're looking hard at the port unions.
my hands are tied.
they're on you with wiretaps.
several phones, several addresses.
have the boy go to Eton.
tell him to come right away to the other place.
you're not calling? - No phones. No more phones.
???
Adieu, my friend.
they forgot your fries.
no, they forgot your fries.
my fries are right in here.
those are my fries.
bitch, everything I say, you hear backwards.
the fries are mine, boy.
go ahead.
eat the fries, you fat fuck. See if I fucking care.
what?
you think I'm fat?
there's our boy.
Lester, Eton's on the move.
we got it.
no needs for an eyeball follow, right?
no need.
a fine fucking kettle of fish.
I heard it, but I had to come see it for myself.
and sure enough... - Major?
you know, I put my faith in you fucking feds.
you let me down.
major, we can talk in my office.
lieutenant.
it's Lieutenant, right?
I gave you a simple assignment:
that fellow, the one in the corner.
and to make it happen, I gave you all this.
good digs, people...
everything you needed.
and what did you give me?
right up the fucking ass, Lieutenant.
major, you're going to get... - Roland, get your shit.
you want to do it your way, fine.
but you ain't gonna use my people to fuck me.
get your gear. I'm pulling you.
I got...
there's work... You said...
get your narrow ass back to the district...
before I slap you with insubordination.
move, shitbird!
Jesus!
detective, my office.
base to 11-34.
target number two is coming at your 20.
copy that. We're on it good.
we're on the Boss.
my God.
he shoots both?
he kills George, right there in the store.
leaves the boy to bleed.
for what?
an argument over a few cars?
that little Polack? - He's crazy, that one.
the police have him now.
the police still there?
go to the store.
whatever the police did not take, papers, pictures, everything... you clean it up.
the warehouse, too. Everything gets clean now.
everything.
and the phones are dead.
did you see that? - They just threw the phones.
11-34 to Surveillance.
standing by. - We got our man.
target number one is a white male, 40s, short...
wearing a tan shirt and a gray tam.
copy your description.
11-34 to Surveillance, both targets are on the move.
we can't make the vehicle from here, - but you sure can. - Copy.
what was he doing with that thing in his hand?
same thing you always do.
probably sending a text message.
my kids are crazy over that.
that's our guy, right?
what's his face Sobotka from the drug corner?
I need to get with Vondas.
who's that?
where is he?
I don't know no Spiros.
no shit. - He just up and clocked him?
Daniels had everybody write what they saw.
even us suits. - That was smart. Daniels is sharp.
Where's Prez now? - Daniels took him home.
I don't think he'll come back to this detail.
you never know.
he might have one of those psychological bullshit things in his jacket...
gives him immunity or something.
Valchek gave him immunity, and he just put Valchek on his ass.
nothing since the Fort Howard meets.
they're definitely dumping phones.
when you use a cell phone and press "send," where does the call go to?
why are you asking? - The Boss Man at Fort Howard.
he tosses the cell phone we're up on, right?
then he pulls out another thingamajig, and he types a message.
text messaging.
it starts at one of those towers they got up all over the place, right?
and ends up in a computer at a wireless provider.
if you knew when the call was made, could you trace the call back to that tower?
cause if you could, mightn't you get a phone number?
you get that, then you got the billing details, right?
fool, do you have any idea how many people use cell phones?
there must be thousands, hundreds of thousands at any time.
what you need is another variable.
another bit of data that's gonna help you isolate your call from all the others.
what if you knew where the call was made?
I mean, exactly where it was made.
we were out in the middle of nowhere.
does that help narrow it down?
Yeah, The Fort Howard sea wall.
it ain't exactly Charles and Baltimore Streets.
you've got another problem. Which wireless company?
there must be Verizon, MCI, AT&T, Sprint...
shit, tin cans and a string. You got dozens of them.
Where's my Harper's? - Say what?
Harper's. The new issue.
you didn't say that one. You said The New Republic and Atlantic...
and a new something else. - I did not forget to tell you Harper's.
every week I tell you the same shit, and every week you forget half of what I say.
tomorrow, first thing, you go to the newsstand and you get Harper's.
and The Nation, too, which you also managed to forget.
you know what the most dangerous thing in America is, right?
a nigger with a library card.
all damn day, he just sit there reading.
and damned if them Eastside bitches don't stay away.
that's real muscle, right there.
true that.
what are we gonna do when we start running out of good product?
that's what we need to ask ourselves.
yo, Bodie, if Stringer wants the Eastside up in here...
then why Barksdale got a man running them off?
this is getting us nowhere.
we got nothing under Pyramid Inc...
or any of the targets at any other cellular company.
it's on McNulty then.
11-35, you got the 20?
I'm on the spot right now.
go.
10-4. Latitude first:
north, 39 degrees. 11. 727.
Longitude: West, 76 degrees. 26. 628.
now, this was a neat trick.
no one ever did it before.
identified a cell phone using time and GPS.
we got everything on the phone that was text messaging...
from those coordinates at 04: 45 p. m. Today.
just a subpoena?
with this, you can get account information and a phone number.
with a search warrant...
you can get two months of text messages.
you got two months of text messages in this file?
I do, if you've got a warrant.
tell you what, friend.
we're gonna go back and start typing that warrant tomorrow morning.
but right now, we wouldn't mind taking a peek...
at what my man's been up to in the last 24 hours.
exigent circumstances.
Thanks, brother.
fuck me.
nothing's easy.
what's up?
they've dumped their phones.
we're trying to get onto the Boss Man's text messaging.
they sent that Greek mess over as email.
after he inputs, the computer will translate it.
got it.
shit.
Hey, Prissy.
thought you'd be here.
fucking Ziggy.
when didn't he do dumb shit?
remember when he forged that Age of Majority card?
we all pooled our money.
you drove us over Brooklyn Park to the cut-rate.
my mom's puke-yellow Chevy.
we told him specifically:
two bottles of Pikesville Rye and...
southern Comfort for me.
what did fucknuts get?
fucking Boone's Farm.
he said that's what the college kids drank.

Oh God!
so, you want to bite!
and, you know not a word, of what I say.
I understand that.
but, you could have guessed...
I am more than a little angry at you.
so I want to be sure you understand...
who's the boss here.
I raise children here, lady.
and disobedience...
is not something I want to be witnessed.
they are very good kids.
I would appreciate it, them to you to imagine.
But，if you're not nice，
if you do not cooperate，I can not do that.
I can not.
and I must first feel better, the loss of my finger.
I'm going home. I will put my wife children and bring...
and you'll be nice.
be nice!
I feel better already, the loss of my finger, now.
a shot!
I heard you. Where you shot? - You'll see!

I like it.
I like it too.
you lose your appetite.

what have you there? A mountain lion?
this is much better than that, my son.
dad?
what is this?
God alone, know where they lived, Peg.
in the forest. In caves.
we will help her.
she has a big patch!
that is correct.
that's the first thing we are going patching. She's hurt.
we start it immediately. Okay!
we must all share, the responsibility to care for her.
basic rules!
do not touch.
I learned the hard way that our friend here, love bites.
she bites?
she took a piece of finger, and swallowed it.
Jesus!
what do we do with her?
we will train her, Brian.
civilize her.
free itself from her, its basic instincts.
this thinking, she is an animal.
and only God knows how she has become.
but we can not make humans to run through the woods...
who think they're animals. It's not good.
it is not safe.
Belle?
yes?
would you a bowl of cereal or make oatmeal?
something simple.
she must be hungry.
the only thing they had to eat, since I've caught her, is...
a finger.
Peg!
go up and take the first aid kit.
I want to treat her wounds.
okay?
okay! Come on girls. Come on!
better than a mountain lion, son?
are we really love her?
we do.
well...
I can not do this often enough say, at this moment...
what is that, Belle? Is that oats?
yes - Good.
very nutritious. Go ahead. Place the front of her.
okay?
so Belle, You put it down...
but not too close... - Good.
and now, Brian...
bring the rake...
okay? - Push it to her.
be careful that you not wasted. Come on!
there you go!
great! Fine, everyone!
that's teamwork. Okay? Everyone did their part.

I think we next time...
just into her should bring.
when she gets hungry enough, she will eat.
okay people...
listen!
this is our project.
and it's a secret.
I would not have to remember, to keep your mouth shut...
but I do it anyway.
we will all have to share, in the care of this...
the same way As with the dogs.
someone will need cleaning, etc...
your mother and I will ensure, for everything...
more complicated. Got it?
Yes.
all right.
mealtime.

seventh Company.
twelfth Company.
ninth Belgian Infantry.
excuse me, sir?
we have been sent some Belgians, they'll be attached to the 14th Company.
go and see what they look like.
it is good to kill with this.
like carving butter.
quiet down!
back in line, Corporal.
where is your captain? - Dead, sir.
lieutenants?
dead, sir.
sergeants?
well, who's in charge here? - I am, sir.
march with the others. We'll sort this out.
all their officers?
they were hit very hard in Flanders, sir.
seventy survivors from a company of 264.
damn the senior command!
I didn't want a Belgian Company in the first place.
certainly not one without officers.
my company can spare a lieutenant.
no company can!
I'm not wasting a French lieutenant on a bunch of Belgians.
unless I make a new one.
bring me Sergeant Moreau.
the Major wishes to discuss something of importance with you.
I suggest you make yourself a little more presentable.
think it's for stealing the Captain's cheese?
no.
stealing the Major's wine?
no.
trying to steal the Colonel's daughter?
maybe.
you have made citations for courage seem commonplace.
thank you, sir.
your command will be a Belgian Company.
sir? - Don't worry.
it will only be for three weeks until their new officers arrive.
I don't understand, sir.
they got here from Flanders this morning.
not much to look at, but they are hell on the enemy.
that, at any rate, is their reputation.
well, where are their officers? - Dead.
all of them? How?
I don't know.
what are you suspicious about?
I've been at the front a long time, sir. I've seen a lot.
I've never seen all the officers in a company die in one battle.
go make acquaintance with your men, Lieutenant Moreau.
Yes, sir.
well? - Good news and bad news.
so, what's the good news?
I'm not in trouble. They made me a lieutenant.
that's very good news, Lieutenant Moreau.
and the bad news? - You'll see in a minute.
Emile. - Give it back!
give it to him.
that's an order.
I don't give a damn about your orders,
Corporal!
stand at attention!
thank you, sir.
who's in charge here? - I am, sir.
come with me.
I am Lieutenant Moreau. What's your name, Corporal?
defense, sir.
Belgian officers will not be arriving for three weeks.
until then, I'm your new commanding officer.
what? With all due respect, Lieutenant...
don't argue with me. It's done.
neither of us can change it, so let me get to the point.
it's no secret the Belgians don't like the French.
is there going to be a problem?
no, sir.
what was going on back there with the book?
the men are a little restless, sir. - That kind of restlessness, I don't need.
who is the man with the scar? Is he a troublemaker?
there was some trouble in Flanders. Yes, sir.
what kind of trouble?
well, we were attacking, the machine gun fire was very bad, our captain, Captain Cote, was behind me.
after the enemy retreated, I went to him.
he was dead.
he was bayoneted in the back.
the man with the scar, Jacques, was standing over him.
your captain could have been killed by the enemy, Corporal.
do you trust this man, this Jacques?
no, sir, I don't.
inform the men of my command.
you are my second officer. Giscard is my first.
be in the Major's bunker at 7: 00 for a briefing.
dismissed.
they've placed us under French command.
Oh, no! - No!
they can't do this, we are Belgians. - What about our new officers?
but they promised. - They'll be here in three weeks.
until then, we'll be led by Lieutenant Moreau.
you little bastard.
you sold us out, didn't you?
I had nothing to do with it.
the boy corporal, he sold us out!
give it a rest.
I have my time with you.
gentlemen, High Command has given us our objective.
a frontal assault along these three kilometers here.
the plan is to outflank the enemy with one brigade here and another here.
the attack will be led by the newly formed Belgian Company led by Lieutenant Moreau.
the key is the Chateau La Maisonette, here.
the Chateau sits on high ground.
german gunners on this ridge have free access over the whole field of operations.
the Chateau must be taken.
I began my career 21 years ago as an enlisted man.
I have been at the bottom, I have been at the top, and I shall be in both places again.
tomorrow on that hill, you're going to face adversity.
I've never known a soldier who hasn't.
there are two things that separate the first-rate soldier and the second-rate soldier.
the first-rate soldier gets up when he's knocked down and the first-rate soldier knows that anything can be accomplished.
anything can be accomplished, if you work together.
we'll get to the top of that hill, if you work together.
you will take the Chateau, if you work together.
dismissed, gentlemen.
our countries have had differences in the past.
I recognize that.
but now, we fight together.
you can follow me or you can follow each other.
the first means an orderly attack and a chance of success.
the second is chaos and death.
you choose.
take your positions.
remember, one whistle, we move right.
two whistle, we move left.
watch out for stray bullets, Corporal.
Jacques, left!
Jacques, left!
jacques! - No!
grenades, fire!
corporal, grenades!
what?
give me some grenades!
Remy, grenades!
grenades! Grenades!
take your ration sack off.
my ration sack? - Just do it!
quick!
idiot!
you're too far away!
what the hell is going on?
they went the wrong way. I tried to throw them some grenades.
those fools, they're right under those machine guns.
more grenades!
we gave you them all!
I kept one.
we've got to get those grenades to them!
I don't see how. - Because you're not looking.
that stone wall. Come on.
we're still too far away, we'll never make it.
don't tell me what we can't do, tell me what we can!
give me your grenade.
if you don't have cover, you make it. Now, follow me.
charge!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah! - Yeah!
dig in! Dig in!
are we going to attack the Chateau? - Not until we get reinforcement.
third battle sector secured. Repeat, third sector is secured.
send reinforcements immediately.
no one else made it.
second and 14th Companies are devastated.
how bad are we?
thirty dead, 15 wounded.
I know what you did out there, Corporal.
I know. - What are you talking about?
do you have a sore arm, Corporal? Is that why you could not reach me?
too far. I threw as hard as I could. - Then you throw like a girl.
you're out of your league, Corporal. - You're out of your mind.
take your hand off me or I'll kill you.
yes? You could kill a man? Up close, like this?
maybe you could show me. You've had enough practice.
break it up.
break it up!
break it up!
attention!
what is this?
I don't know about the Belgian army, but the French army does not allow fighting among itself.
one more breach of this rule, I'll have you both shot.
get back to your posts, all of you.
it's quiet. - Yes, quiet.
counterattack!
counterattack! - Counterattack!
now we begin again.
fix bayonets!
I'll see you afterwards, Bernard. - Yes, Alain.
gas!
my mask.
mask.
it's broken. Broken.
Indy, give me your mask. Give me your mask.
I can't.
up! Up! Behind the wall!
they're not attacking. - Very well.
what in hell's name is that?
I don't know.
mother of God.
retreat!
sergeant, Corporal.
we are relieved for two days. Tell the men.
get your kits together, we've been given a two-day leave.
take it easy.
first I get clean, then I get drunk. Call me when the shooting starts.
stupid British. Look at them.
what's wrong with tennis? I play tennis.
we should challenge them. - That's a great idea.
you know, I'm really looking forward to this...
Yeah. Okay, what's it gonna be, up or down?
sergeant, could you just check the height?
that looks about the right height.
good luck, my Belgian friends. - Good luck.
what will it be then?
losers buy the winners a round of beer.
Oh, lousy British.
you fight like girls and you bet like them, too.
I should kick your greasy Belgian ass for saying that, but seeing that we're allies, how about the losers buy the beers all night?
we fight like men, mate.
well, I lost. I guess the drinks are on me.
what do you say, Robert? The beer over there is foul.
but I did spot a rather good bottle of sweet wine over there.
no thanks. Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
well spoken. - It's not original.
then well stolen. - That's Shakespeare.
Yes, in fact, it is. Richard II, Act One...
scene three.
a Belgian corporal who speaks good English with a mastery of Shakespeare, I don't believe it. Good Lord.
whatever next? The Germans playing cricket?
excuse me.
so, young fan of literature, do you know anything about verse?
Oh, I've read a little.
good. Good. I want your opinion on something.
you wouldn't read that, would you?
poems by a Siegfried Sassoon? A German?
no, he's British.
read the poem that's marked, Corporal. Read it aloud.
dreamers, by Siegfried Sassoon.
soldiers are citizens of death's gray land "drawing no dividends from time's to-morrows "In the great hour of destiny they stand "each with his feuds, and jealousies, and sorrows "soldiers are sworn to action they must win "some flaming fatal Climax with their lives "soldiers are dreamers when the guns begin "they think off relit homes, clean beds and wives "I see them in foul dug-outs gnawed by rats "and in the ruined trenches lashed with rain "dreaming of things they did with balls and bats "and mocked by hopeless longing to regain "bank-holidays, and picture shows and spats "and going to the office in the train
if you ask me, that's the silliest rubbish I've ever heard.
what do you think, Corporal?
I think it's quite good. I really do.
Congratulations. You've passed the test, Corporal.
lieutenant Robert Graves. - And Lieutenant Siegfried Sassoon.
corporal Henri Defense. You wrote this?
well, who did you think wrote it? An American?
let's get a drink, I'm parched.
we'll have lost every good man in England by the time this bloody thing's over.
damn the British government.
don't start. When you get going, it's close to treason.
what about the British government?
the day after England declared war on Germany, I enlisted.
like all good men, I was patriotic.
I thought we were waging war for peace, for freedom.
but there are men in England, Corporal Defense, who have motivations that are entirely different.
what? - Money.
the industrialists, the makers of arms, have every desire to keep this blasted thing going.
that's a bit strong. - Is it?
don't you realize that their profits have tripled since this conflict began?
I wish you wouldn't say things like that, Siegfried.
it confuses me.
it may be feeble minded of me, but I have to have a reason to keep going.
excuse me, Corporal. It was a pleasure to meet you.
what happened?
robert had a nervous breakdown about a month ago.
forgive me.
if you're so cynical about the war, why do you go on fighting?
because it's my duty.
they look young.
so did you, a month ago.
come, Corporal.
our objective remains the same, the taking of Chateau La Maisonette.
intelligence confirms that the enemy has strengthened his fortifications here and here with additional men, over a thousand this time.
your valor is beyond question.
you must look into yourself to be the best soldier you can be.
the second-rate soldier lives with mediocrity and dies with regret, but the first-rate soldier, he lives with honor and when death comes, he dies with honor.
good luck to you, gentlemen.
take your positions!
fix bayonets.
I'll pray for your soul, Corporal.
why don't you just shut up and follow the orders?
grenades!
ready!
now!
charge!
you stuck with us. Thanks.
go to hell! I don't want your thanks!
you'd better watch yourself.
lieutenant Moreau suspects you killed Captain Cote at Flanders.
Really? Oh, that's crazy.
and what do you think, huh?
come on, keep going. To the Chateau, men!
Regroup! Wait for the counterattack!
prepare for counterattack!
No!
don't die!
we can't move. - We've got to get those guns.
take some men, find the tunnel network.
you two, give me your rifles.
bring that and follow me.
two fire, one goes.
don't forget to fire.
don't!
you'll blow up the other end of the tunnel and trap us in here.
they did it.
charge!
surrender!
drop your weapons and come out with your hands up.
sergeant, take those men prisoners.
I go now, Alain.
no. No, Bernard.
tell the Major
I died with honor.
soldiers are citizens of death's gray land "drawing no dividend from time's to-morrows "In the great hour of destiny they stand "each with his feuds, and jealousies and sorrows
I don't like this.
how long ago did the messenger leave, Corporal?
twenty-five minutes, sir.
damn it!
I can't hold this position with 30 men. No one can.
I'm sorry about Sergeant Giscard, Lieutenant.
he did his duty.
the weather is fine today.
reminds me of home.
sir, no matter what happens, I... - It reminds me of my wife.
I can't move!
help me!
Indy! - It's happening!
you didn't kill Captain Cote, did you? - No.
but that doesn't mean we are friends.
Emile, have you seen Remy or any of the others?
no, we are the only ones left.
what are those? - Officers' uniforms.
there's a captain for me and a lieutenant for you.
they're French. Where did you get them?
don't ask.
when the officers who own these wake up, they'll have you court-martialed.
they won't wake up, Henri. They are dead.
the guards were throwing them out. Now, put it on.
I hear commissioned officers are treated much better where we are going.
where are we going?
we will know soon enough.
I'm Lieutenant Pierre Blanc from Paris.
captain Francois Tusson from Lyons.
at last, I outrank you.
maybe I will have you shine my boots, yes?
don't count on it.
new recruits.
maybe this will be the war which does not end.
maybe it will just go on forever.
now's our chance.
french artillery.
very impressive.
as good as the Germans.
come on, we gotta get to those trees.
what about the guards? They'll be looking for us.
they're probably all dead.
come on, we're 100 yards from those woods.
Double-barbed wire, guard towers.
at least it's not Dusterstadt. - What's that?
you don't know about Dusterstadt?
it's a medieval castle on the Danube, more of a dungeon, really.
it's where they send all the bad apples.
any ideas?
not yet, but it's only our first day.
No! No! Please, no! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
explain.
we were playing catch.
my ball. - Catch?
with whom?
with me.
I'm sorry.
I swear, I'll get you, Benet.
thank you. I'm Captain Jean Benet.
lieutenant Pierre Blanc. - Captain Francois Tusson.
so, how do you like our vacation resort?
I'm disappointed. They advertised a beach.
with bathing beauties.
well, you know Germans, always skimping on the extras.
what were you doing?
come with me.
the new men, Colonel. Captain Tusson and Lieutenant Blanc.
welcome, gentlemen.
did you get a new measurement?
I estimate another 15 feet to the first wire.
now we have two problems.
first, we're out of tunnel supports.
we've used all the wood available, even bed slats.
any more and the guards will be onto us.
and second, we've run out of places to store dirt from the tunnel.
so, it's hopeless to continue.
exactly. There is nothing more that we can do.
men, please.
do you have a solution, Captain Benet?
we dig the remaining 20 feet in one night, and we dump the dirt right here, on the floor.
but what about the tunnel supports?
we won't need them.
the tunnel will hold together for a few hours.
we'll dig in shifts.
we'll dig so fast, we'll blast out before the tunnel collapses.
who do you have in mind to do this blasting?
me, and anyone else who's up to it.
I'll do it.
are you crazy? - It'll work.
this is insanity.
that's what they say about every great idea at first.
ten feet to go.
what?
we've gone farther than that.
no, this is accurate.
I'll take over.
there's got to be another way. - Our only chance is through this dirt.
four feet to go.
we've reached the end. - Tell them to pop up.
Yes, sir.
ready?
here goes.
periscope.
I hate to tell you this, but we're five feet short.
I don't understand. - We're between the fences.
my calculations were accurate. - Not accurate enough.
that's five feet. We should be past the second wire.
it's time, gentlemen.
not you two. You go after these other men.
we dug the tunnel.
you dug the last 20 feet. These men dug the first 100 feet.
he's right.
I don't care. Without the last 20 feet, there'd be no tunnel.
back off, Lieutenant.
guards.
good evening, Captain Heinz.
you look uncomfortable, Benet.
me?
why are you uncomfortable?
it must be that smell, Captain Heinz.
the smell of Germany, the armpit of Europe.
I will have you in isolation for the rest of your life!
let's go.
come on!
run!
Emile, hurry up!
Emile, hurry up!
Oh, God.
welcome back, Lieutenant.
lieutenant Devereux, 30 days in isolation.
captain Bordenais, your second attempt.
sixty days.
you know what they say, Commandant. "Practice makes perfect.
ninety days.
see you in three months.
lieutenant Blanc, a man who does not waste time.
you arrive here at 4: 00 p. m. 12 hours later, you are climbing out of a tunnel.
remarkable.
I have taken measures to limit your career as an escape artist.
I don't expect to dig out of isolation, Commandant.
who said anything about isolation?
I have arranged for your transfer to the maximum security prison at Dusterstadt.
what?
eventually, Lieutenant, it becomes clear when a prisoner is incorrigible.
your records show four escape attempts at other prisons, and now five.
that makes you an incorrigible, Lieutenant Blanc.
wait, there's been a mistake. I'm not him.
you're not who, Lieutenant?
I'm not Lieutenant Blanc.
my name's Henri Defense. I'm a corporal in the Belgian army.
and I am Kaiser Wilhelm. Don't insult my intelligence!
get him out of here.
I hope you like your new home, Lieutenant.
let me be brief.
you cannot tunnel, the castle's built up on granite.
if you try and disguise yourself as a German soldier, you will be shot as a spy.
if you attempt to bribe my men, you will be shot as a corrupting influence on German morale.
I don't want any trouble from you.
east Castle.
and so, with the advancements in new technology, the...
packages!
gentlemen, control yourselves. We'll open the mail after the lecture.
introduce yourself, Lieutenant.
Hello, I'm Lieutenant Blanc.
have a seat, Lieutenant Blanc.
I'm lecturing on medieval military tactics.
why medieval tactics?
I beg your pardon?
well, if French and English generals would have studied the American Civil War, we'd have beaten the Germans by now.
a bold statement, Lieutenant. Explain further, if you please.
that was the first war that armies used modern technology to full advantage.
the cavalry charge had become obsolete.
even Ulysses S. Grant realized that the future of war lay not in the open field but...
in trenches, yes.
well, you know a good deal about this subject, Lieutenant.
but if you're in Dusterstadt, you must know a good deal about something else.
escaping from German prisons.
do you have plans?
we may.
you speak with an accent, Lieutenant.
I do? - Yes.
I can't make it out.
there was a rumor circulating that the Commandant was releasing spies into the prison.
Germans impersonating French and English officers.
I wonder what we do if we exposed one of them?
we would kill him.
so, tell me, Lieutenant, where are you from in France?
Paris. - So am I.
name the three roads leading from Paris to Versailles.
the Rue de Napoleon.
the...
traitor! Spy! - Wait.
he's not German.
who won the World Series in 1912?
what? - Just answer the question.
the Boston Red Sox. - He's not German, he's American.
is your rank also fake, Lieutenant?
okay, I enlisted in the Belgian army.
they were the only ones that would take me without asking questions about my age.
I'm a corporal.
a corporal.
and where did you get the jacket?
did you know you could be shot for stealing it?
the previous owner wasn't going to need it.
I understand. Come on, let's open our mail.
gentlemen. Gentlemen.
so, here you are, Jean-Paul.
there you are, Yuri, all the way from Saint Petersburg.
remember, save your string.
what are you doing with all this string?
russian superstition.
you put the string from a gift in your pocket and you will get many more.
hello. Lambert, Royal Flying Corps.
I'm in charge of the infirmary. You must be the new man here.
I came in yesterday. Nice to meet you. - Right. Right.
listen, just so that you know, I'm not actually a doctor,
I studied medicine for a couple of years, but then I switched over to law, yes?
but I can give you some advice, though.
don't eat the meat, it's rotten, and you don't need it anyway.
also, boil all your drinking water.
that way, you'll save yourself a lot of stomach problems, if you know what I mean.
and if there are any other problems that you have, you can just have a word with my two orderlies over there, Simon and Ian.
okay?
Thanks. - Jolly good. Carry on.
captain de Gaulle, you must let me have a look at that leg of yours.
if you neglect it, it's going to drop off.
I've fooled a lot of people with my French.
no doubt you have. It is excellent.
how did you know I was American?
my father is a professor of philosophy.
during my youth, I met many American scholars.
all spoke French fluently, but none perfectly.
I recognized your game at once.
why are you in Dusterstadt?
I refuse to submit to captivity.
I'll get out of here, it's only a matter of time.
how? - Does it matter?
when a man accepts bondage to Germans, he accepts death.
do you hate the Germans?
they are the natural enemy of France.
we fought them in 1870, we fight them now, and this, I can guarantee you, Corporal, before the century is over, we will fight them again.
the art of war is changing. It is up to us to change with it.
in 1415, a small band of English soldiers wiped out the flower of French knighthood in one afternoon.
how?
the English longbow, it could pierce a knight's armor.
they were sitting ducks.
mark my words, Corporal, the next Great War will not be won with superior men, it will be won with superior machines, tanks and airplanes.
in here, please.
hello.
we want to ask you something.
what? - Are you...
cowboy?
what? - Like in the moving pictures.
americans are cowboys, you are American, so you must be cowboy, no?
well, not really. I can ride a horse, but I...
Oh, really? - And the lasso?
can you make the lasso and the rope of broncobuster?
well, I suppose if I had to.
a cowboy! - A cowboy!
is there some point to this?
come here.
please.
we want you to make the lasso and rope something, something really important.
like what? - Like that.
you're joking.
you're not joking.
you're out of your minds.
you want me to make a lasso and rope that spike?
where am I gonna get a rope that long?
where in hell did you...
the string from all those packages.
can you do it? - This makes things different.
so, tell me, Corporal, if you weren't fighting this war, what dream would you be following?
I guess I'd be at home, going to high school.
where did you get captured?
at this...
we charged a hill and took it.
the counterattack was deadly. Almost everyone died.
and you?
Verdun. I was knocked unconscious. Germans found me in the mud.
that's where I got this.
and that is Dinant, Mesnil-les-Hurlus...
de Gaulle's body is now the map of France.
so, tell me, Corporal, about your escape plans.
don't lie to me, I know you've been working on something.
you're the devious type.
maybe I have.
what is it? I can save you a lot of time and effort.
something with the Russians?
possibly.
those crazy Russians. They have got a new plan every day.
last week, they wanted me to help them build an airplane.
I wouldn't waste your time with them, Corporal.
are you ready?
well, I wanted to talk to you about something.
a new idea for our escape?
not exactly.
I'm not going.
Why?
Oh, you have talked to the British and the French.
we know what they say about us.
that we're crazy Russians, huh? That we'll get you killed?
well... - Come here. Come. Come.
two years. It took us two years to make this.
look, there's the outside parapet. You can do it.
then down the outside wall, then freedom.
all right. All right, I'll do it.
hold that.
I'll go first. - Why you?
I made the rope. - You made half of it.
stop arguing!
we'll go at the same time.
that's not a good idea. This rope won't hold you both.
I made this with my own hands. It's strong enough.
go.
each new prisoner at Dusterstadt is told of the difficulty, the impossibility of escape.
it is curious how often I am disappointed by the lack of communication.
I hope these visual aids will make things more clear.
Dusterstadt was chosen to hold you not because of its aesthetics, not because of its geographic location, but because it cannot be escaped from.
I hope in future we can avoid more painful lessons.
attention!
dismissed.
poor bastards.
you were with them, weren't you?
Yeah, I was.
now what should we do?
what we always do, keep trying.
it's no use.
don't say that. Never give up.
I'm not giving up, I'm just facing the truth.
the Commandant's right. - Quiet! I won't stand negative talk.
the only way out of here's in a coffin.
well, it's just a small graveyard on the very edge of the town.
before the war they used to use it to bury the indigent and the insane.
and that's the only place they go? - Well, yes. As far as I know, yes.
who does the burying?
what do you mean? The actual digging?
Yeah. - Well, my two orderlies, Simon and Ian.
can they be trusted? - Yes, of course they can.
can they get away with it?
I think so.
there won't be much margin for error.
Yes. Yes, I understand, but the truth is the orderlies never bury the bodies six feet deep.
it's much too much hard work.
they're lucky if they bury them half that depth.
and the guards don't notice?
no, no. No, no, no. They're nowhere near the graveyard.
they're far too superstitious. They wait with the trucks.
stop.
sorry, old man.
I hate you.
over there.
sir, get your knees down.
I can't. It's too short.
sorry, sir, but you must.
wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. - What?
did you cut the nails down? - Of course, sir.
see, sir, like thumbtacks, one good push from inside and they'll come undone.
okay.
so, what do you say we bury some stiffs?
down.
what? - Get in the boat, he's taking you back.
but we've got to dig the graves.
no more digging, hmm? Go, get in the boat.
what do you mean, "No more digging"? - We are not going to bury them.
if you're not gonna bury them, what are you gonna do with them?
burn them.
off!
captain de Gaulle!
did you hear them? They're not going to the graveyard.
they're going to a crematorium!
something's on top of this coffin.
captain, damn it, answer me! We've gotta get out of here!
I was raised a Catholic, I should say something.
get it over with.
dear God, let this man go to hell.
I thought you'd never hear me.
come on.
don't run, okay?
Ein, zwei, drei, vier
there is a Jewish story.
an ordinary Jewish joke.
a father was teaching his little son to be less afraid, to have more courage, by having him jump down the stairs.
he put his son on the second stair and said, "Jump, and I'll catch you."
then on the third stair, and said, "Jump, and I'll catch you."
the little boy was afraid, but he trusted his father and did what he was told, and jumped into his arms.
the father put him on the next step, and then the next, each time telling him, "Jump, and I'll catch you."
then the boy jumped from a very high step, but this time, the father stepped back and the boy fell flat on his face.
he picked himself up, bleeding and crying, and the father said to him, "That'll teach you."
here, put this sweater on. Nuh-uh.
don't be ridiculous You're shaking like a bowl of Jell-O.
put the sweater on.
mom. Oh, for God's sake l betrothe you to me.... l betrothe you to me...
...with this ring.... ...with this ring...
...according to the Jewish law.
l betrothe you to me according to the Jewish law.
l betroth you to me forever in righteousness and justice, in kindness and in mercy and you shall know God.
for you.
well, I'm dying.
you're not dying. You had an episode and they want to watch you.
have a nice weekend. Hm.
she's always dying. Why are you rushing.
sorry, rounds took forever. Sorry I'm late.
Oh, baby, no problem.
have a good evening. Thank you.
you're late for Shabbat and you have to tell this stranger our private business.
mom, you're lucky we come at all.
I'm lucky you come to Shabbat. Why is that? Stop eating.
cos it's the 21st century, cos we're not in Babylon.
we don't have to remind ourselves to let our land lie fallow.
the whole point of Shabbat is.
l was eleven minutes late.
you're getting worked up, and being worked up all the time never got anyone pregnant.
we've been trying for 10 months.
where does everyone have to get to. I'm not worked up l would just like very much to have a baby.
so adopt. Who's really mine.
ln China, they're throwing them into trash cans.
our God, King of the universe.
adopt a baby, for God's sake, adopt a baby and then have a baby.
you're 39 years old. That's what you did.
that's why you can't do it, because l did it. Being like me is such a...
there's a feeling. No, there's not.
when he was little, l watched you.
l watched you...watch him.
l saw you look at each other. lt was different.
l want that.
you listen to me.
there's no difference.
are you here?
where are you?
I'm in here.
sweetie, can you come in here and sit down for a minute.
I'll be there in one second.
Hi.

I'll see you all the time, every day.
but listen, l want...
l want you to know something. Do you want...
Yeah, thank you.
what did you want me to know?
I'm 100 percent sure.
ls it because l didn't say the right thing the other night lf you wanna pursue this drawing thing.. it's nothing.
l just meant that if.. I'm attracted to...
somebody has to make some money.
l don't...
l can't make love if we don't talk l don't, l don't want this life.
don't you want to take your coat off?
why don't you want to take your coat off?
Oh, God
I'm really sure we shouldn't...
I'll see you in school.
come on.
can you explain this to me？
Mrs. Epner Green, this is chaos. Who's in charge lt says he has resigned.
and you knew nothing about this？lf Mr. Green is out, why is there no substitute ls he coming in？

Mrs. Epner Green, this is way too many kids for one room.

OK, the parents can go. Mr. Green will not be coming in.
ms. Epner will be teaching both classes.

you betcha.
Oh, my God
OK. You should come in. This is bad timing.

l want a baby. l can't explain it.
lt's like being hungry or having to pee.
please don't tell me to adopt.
l wouldn't. l won't. l never will.

Nring forth true repose Under the wings of the Divine Presence in the great heights of the holy and pure, who like the brilliance of the heavens give shine to the spirit of Gittel daughter of Tuvia and Hannah...
who is deceased. May her soul rest in Heaven.
to Gertrude Trudy Epner, who has gone to her lasting rest.
master of all, we pray to You, remember her worthy and righteous deeds while among the living and say amein.
amein.

I'm sorry
not the purchasing, the requisitioning.
the office is that way.
thank you.
are you April Epner. Can l help you l represent someone from your past.
someone from your past who's looking to make contact.
would the discovery of the identity of your birth mother be welcome news？
I'm her assistant and friend. She's a celebrity.
what kind of celebrity？
she's, she's well known. She really wants to meet you, but she's very cautious, you understand.
but now l can definitely recommend it.
you're recommending me.
you taking this the wrong way.
here.
let her speak for herself.
dear Gabrielle,
did you know Gabrielle is what l named you l believe the time has come for us to meet.
let's have lunch tomorrow, Saturday, you and me. Narbetta Restaurant at one.
your mother, Nernice.
good afternoon. Can l help you, miss？
Oh, hello. Do you happen to have a reservation for someone named Bernice？
Yes, of course we do. Right this way, please.
a glass of champagne while you wait？
do you have a ladies room？
Hello, beautiful. Oh
thank you.
I'm a...teacher.
sounds like Judy Holliday.
you get anyone besides her, hang up.
you won't get in unless you use my name, right l know, it's terrible, but we're talking about your health.
thank you very much. Mm.
let me just look at you.
you're magnificent. What's your name？
Oh, thank you. Um, what is your name？
you got my letter. Uh, your last name？
Oh, Graves. I'm so happy you don't know it.
why would l.. How do you feel right now？
how do you feel l feel like you are the reward for everything l ever did right in my entire life.
Oh. And how do you feel l, um... Thank you.
I'm wondering how you can be certain you're actually my mother.
are you married l mean, do you have anyone？
someone who takes you in his arms or her arms.
God knows l only want you to be happy.
someone who holds you in the night when you afraid？
you didn't answer.. Doesn't matter.
some of the richest periods of my life came when l was between love affairs.
were you raised with brothers or sisters？ l have a brother.
Oh, l wanna meet him.
lt's a little soon.. Hello, you two.
Oh, Alan, you remember Gabrielle. lt's April.
recovering from the abominable way l approached you l make for you a special mother/daughter antipasto.
someday I'll tell you how we have Alan to thank for this.
l uh, l produced the show that led to this.
l looked in the camera and the whole story just came out.
our story.
such a powerful moment. Excuse me, what is our story？
I'm sorry to bother you. That's all right.
Alan, do you have a pen？
no, l just want to say, l love you.
l watch you all the time.
l think you're just the best. Enjoy your lunch.
thank you.
lf you have a TV show, why have l never heard of you
you watch local TV at 10: 30 in the morning
never. Me, either.
how much do you know about my parents l know that you lost Trudy three weeks ago, and you lost Julius three years before that.
how do you know who they were
Oh, I've known since the day l lost you.
were they good to you. How
you weren't allowed to know that. l read it.
upside down, across the adoption counselor's desk.
baby Girl Epner, born April first.
so, it's possible.
what. That you are who you say you are.
listen, l only got to have you for three days, but that doesn't change the fact that you are my daughter.
you are the most important thing on earth to me.
you must know that. Do you have children l think your own family might feel strange about you tracking me down like this.
my family is me and you.
lt shows in your face that you know I'm your mother.
what about your husband. Oh, l don't have one.
what about you. Ever been married？
Yes. How's that going
you know, there's a certain presumption.
don't lock Bernice out.
she loved the people who raised her. You're her mother.
but it's natural she would have questions
I'm sitting here
Yes, you are.
ask me anything.
you're sitting on anger. Ask me anything, hit hard, ask me anything you want.
why did you give me up
on you will go, though the weather be foul.
on you will go, though your enemies prowl.
onward up many a frightening creek "Though your arms may get sore and your sneakers may leak.
what. lt's a book, by Dr. Seuss.
did your adoptive parents read it to you. No.
Oh, that's a shame, because it's a map of your life really.
the whole point of which is that every ending is a beginning.
now, when Trudy and Julius passed, that was an ending, but in a funny kind of a silver liningy way, it's brought us together, hasn't it l have to go.
wait. Stop.
don't... Don't go.
Gabrielle. April, god damm it
would you like to know who your father was
he was a famous man, now dead.
why don't we go to my office and really talk
thank you, no. We could go for a drive.
l would like to walk. Oh, you like to walk
you sound like your father.
my famous father, now dead, went for walks
I'm a walker myself, you know.
all kinds of exercise, I'm a nut for.
could we slow down for just a moment
Oh, being related like this is just incredible.
you were saying about my father
you hardly know me yet.
well, thank you, Ms. Graves, it was traumatic and potentially illuminating to have met you.
l met him when l was fifteen.
l worked in perfume. Where, exactly
well, four blocks that way, as it happens.
used to be Bonita Teller. You can look it up.
since l wasn't rich, l earned extra money working in their perfume department.
so this was a customer. Oh, a very special customer.
he came in to buy a gift for his mother.
he was close to his mother, too close, because no woman could measure up. Who was it
he was immediately flirtatious, but not in a boorish way.
he was, and l say this in all humility... enchanted.
who was it. Steve McQueen.
how dare you. We were deeply in love.
well, what went wrong
he was single when l met him. Separated, anyway.
l never would've gotten involved had his relationship been viable but l sensed they weren't through.
they" would be Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw lf you watch The Getaway, you'll sense a certain closeness.
l feel good about that.
by the way, do you have any children
was it a one-night stand
Oh, the memory lasted a lifetime.
your generation is so cynical.
when was l conceived. Around the fourth of July.
around or on. On
was he right or left handed
what kind of question is that
circumcised
Catholic. l understand your parents were Jewish.
so what So am l. Well, God bless.
what does that mean
God bless that you believe in God.
you don't believe in God l don't know. Watched the news lately
I'll ask you one more time, why did you give me up？ l didn't give you up. You were taken from me.
didn't they tell you that
my father was very religious.
l held you in my arms for three days, praying that it wouldn't happen.
but it did.
he walked in, he took you, and he left me screaming.
how do l know any of this is true
because it is
all right, listen to me, and please respect what l say to you.
l have to go home, think about this, and decide what to believe.
OK.
OK.
thank you.
l appreciate you.. Can you drop me？
What？Where？
back there.
all right.
when can we do this again？
everyone needs family.
l will call you.
let me give you my number. Do you have a pen？
OK.
give me your hand.
please lt's harder to lose a hand.
this isn't just a thousand-to-one shot.
this is a professional blood sport.
lt can happen to you.
and then it can happen to you again.
l want my mommy.
Hi, everybody. Thanks for your patience.
Oh, some more than others. l want my mommy. l want my mommy.
ruby, l need you to come here now. Get your shoes on.
why don't you come in first l mean, for obvious reasons.
that's OK. You go ahead.
besides, we're having so much fun here.
are you sure. Of nothing.
l want my mommy.
pardon me. What？
we're all right. We're fine.
you're fine She's fine. Yeah, we're fine. Mm-hm, fine.
listen, I'm sorry about what l.. Shh.
I'm sorry about what l said to you.
listen, I'm four weeks divorced.
for all l know, l was coming on to you.
were you coming on to me？
no, l wasn't.
why l wasn't, l can't imagine.
um, this is Jimmy Ray's portfolio.
l think he's in trouble. You do
sorry, what were you about to say. His printing is good.
really. Mm-hm.
K's made him nervous, but he likes them now.
he seems happiest.. He has night terrors.
did you say night terrors. l think they're night terrors.
he walks in his sleep. How often
once, ten months ago.
what happened. He peed in the fridge.
have you slept？
Oh, no. No.
l love his hands.
l do. l love how he uses them, how expressive he is.
l love that, too.
he has a little less confidence just right at the moment, but l think that's to be expected. Do you have kids
no.
he talks about his mom a lot. He seems to worship her.
from afar. She's on a trip round the world.
she's a painter. She's painting the world with her boyfriend.
Oh.
l see you outside in your car. ls that...
Yes. l work out there. l write.
ln your car l like to keep an eye on the building. lt relaxes me.
Mm.
so why didn't you have kids？
I've watched you. You love them. And you're...
old
no.
no, my God, no. You can't be more than what, you're 35, 34
I'm 39 and a half years old and I've never been pregnant.
well, if you put it like that.
lt looks pretty bleak, doesn't it？
no. No, it looks painful.
and beautiful.
and l hope you get everything you want.
um, dinner.
apparently l want dinner.
well, bon appetit. Oh, would you like to get some dinner？
no, l'd rather eat frozen food alone for the fifteenth month in a row.
Yes, l'd like to get dinner.
but l think you are a very beautiful woman and for some reason l decided not to go on any kind of date for at least a year.
Why？ Because I'm a fucking idiot.
thank you, you're gorgeous. I'm leaving now.
Yes, l would like to get some dinner.
best friends. He said that. Mm-hm.
ls this man entirely intact？
you know, we were best friends. l loved him.
kept hoping one day, pop, he'd be a grown-up.
so your wife was seeing someone else
pretty much everyone else.
l was too much for her.
for your wife. Mm-hm.
I'm sure she didn't feel that way.
she told me. What did she say "You're too much for me."
Ohh So was it just out of the blue lt was out of the blue because l was an idiot.
l came across the ocean to be a blind idiot.
this woman may actually let her kids grow up without knowing their mother.
l hope not.
how can you know if someone's your mother l mean, literally, if someone says they're your mother, how can you know for sure
DNA test, l guess. Why l mean, you don't not look like Steve McQueen.
ls she a credible person. l have no idea.
my God, you have a chance to get to know your mother.
Yes, l guess l do.
what do you write in here?
books.
jackets. Jackets for other people's books. For now.
get a hair. I'm sorry？
for the DNA test. Get a hair.
Oh.
thank you.
well.
l don't wanna say good night. l don't either.

I'm sure he'd understand.
OK, l need you to do something for me.
l need you to get in your car. Which is your car
Yeah, l need you to get in your car and drive away, first.
because l can't.
will you do that for me？
seriously. Yes.
you will go home, right l won't find you guys here in the morning wearing the same thing.
OK. Good night. Good night.
maybe l should call you when you get home, just so you can be sure.
l'd appreciate that. l worry.
Yeah, l do, too.
what are you making
well, it's peanut butter and jelly. And l have to confess that we don't share your countrymen's love of peanut butter.
and jelly isn't jelly.
that's another thing l have to have a word with you about.
well, if you were in England, what would you be making？
this would probably be cheese and pickle.
did you say cheese and pickle
you don't know what pickle is.
you give me a hard time about peanut butter and jelly and you say cheese and pickle
I'm defending food to an Englishman.
ls that happening to me right now
our sex life was dominated by her artwork, you know
what do you mean
well, she liked to depict acts of autoeroticism.
Oh l sometimes make toast and have tea after I've brushed my teeth, and l don't brush them again. Do you ever do that？
no, no, no, l can't. I'm, um, I'm British.

I'm partial to the flyweight Latino

I've very much enjoyed talking to you these last nights, but we shouldn't go out of our way to talk to each other here, in a private way.
ln a private way. I've thought about it...
I've thought about it, too.
let's go, Daddy.
OK. Well, good night.
Um...goodbye.
one thing.
l don't sleep, usually, so if you want to look up information about your mother, l'd be happy to help.
Oh, boy, l am so bad at that stuff.
at some point l.. Here.
lt's about Steve McQueen.
what about him l got your birth date from the office.
listen, l have to do something with the energy I'm spending not asking you out.
do you wanna know？
steve McQueen was on the Yangtze River, it's in Southern China, making a film called The Sand Pebbles.
he was there between March, 1966, and September.
you were born in April. Yes.
ls it possible this could've happened in Southern China
she told me Manhattan.
sorry, l just don't think he could've been.
l don't know who you are or what you want, but l want you to stay away from me.
how dare you invade the life of another human being this way？
what kind of selfish, psychotic, compassionless freak must you be.
do not ever try to contact me again or l will call the police, l swear to God
Freddy. You sitting down
Yes.
she's your mother.
begin. l know what a risk this is for you.
you have no idea.
and nothing could possibly excuse my having told you a lie.
begin
his name was Jack Watske.
he was a Ukrainian boy from the neighborhood.
a little gangly, but gorgeous.
did you ever meet anybody and know in a heartbeat you'd do whatever they say
you dated. We courted.
meaning. We had sex three times.
he told me l had a perfect body l was so inexperienced, l had no idea he was right l still have a fine body but of course it's never the same after childbirth.
would you please? My girlfriend's parents were out of town.
he and l were in a sleeping bag in their backyard.
we made love.
lt was so cold outside the sleeping bag, and so warm in it, and afterwards, l cried and cried and cried, and he pretended to understand why.
so that's where l was conceived.
no, you were conceived a week later, according to a great American tradition.
speak English. l fucked him at a drive-in.
what movie. Bullitt.
why did you lie. l don't know why.
l thought it was ugly and ordinary, and l wanted to make it beautiful.
lf l made him famous and dead, he'd be famously dead, and you wouldn't waste time trying to find him.
l tried for years. He's unfindable. How convenient.
look, don't you think that if l could offer your father up to you, l'd do it, whatever shape he was in. How should l know what you'd do？
because I'm telling you. What is that worth.
I'm giving you my word. Bernice, look at me.
l will know if you're lying.
memorize this moment. l know what l did to you.
l lied in the scariest way imaginable, and now, at the worst of all possible times, when your husband just left you...
or did you leave him l get the sense that he left you.
OK, it's none of my business.
lt will not happen again.
l knew it. l knew it. That's why l said Steve McQueen.
what. l knew you'd be ashamed.
lt's not that. Please understand, it's not you as much as me.
I'm glad to have met you, but I'm going through some things, and now is not a good time.
thank you for understanding, and l really do hope that our paths will cross again.
I'm gonna walk home now, so...goodbye.
you're absurd. Give me 72 hours.
three lousy days. l want to know you.
l want to meet your brother.
I'm begging you.
I'm on my knees.
metaphorically speaking, I'm on my knees.
Oh, for God's sake lt's Freddy. Leave me a message.
I'm begging you. Come with me.
I'm going to this event with her.
she wants to meet you. Or at least call me back.
l know you're working hard, but l worry.
l was," mumbled Gun Smith.
no one had ever tangled with those two varmints and lived to tell the tale.

what. Humiliate me.
do you know the actual, physical pain.
why are you calling me？
because l miss you, and l thought now that some time has passed...
lt's been 23 days, you idiot You're ready to be my friend
well... OK, glad l called.
well, take care.. My mom died.
did you say.. Talk to you later.
wait, when. 22 days ago.
why didn't you call me？
Oh, l don't know, l guess l just didn't feel that close to you.
l have to, l have to see you.
Oh, no. I'll end up in bed with you and...
l want to be there.
really Do you promise to be there for better or worse, for richer and poorer, in sickness.. l miss you.
how much
a lot.
enough
that's what l thought. Be a man and leave me alone "For better or worse.
I'm gonna guess not your brother, right？
no.
Oh, where are you going l think leaving. Please don't leave.
now where you going. Not leaving.
you just said you were leaving. l was then, now not.
but you're walking away.
l have to do something.
OK. Are we doing it yet？
all right, look, you were just talking to your husband about for better or worse and god knows what else, and l just, l feel...
Aargh
fuck
when l feel this way, l find it helps to take my "Aargh fuck" out for a walk, so that's what doing, and you're not invited.
but l will say this, this is a first date, and if you're not done with him who you're married to, if you two aren't done, it's fine.
lt's more than fine. Just tell me. I'm not ready, anyway.
Frank, I'm done with him. lt's OK if you're not.
but l am. How do l know？
you're gonna have to...trust me.
you kidding me？
and it doesn't feel like a first date, not to me.
you wait until we try to say good night.
I'm sorry again, and l had a wonderful time with you.
l did, too.
see l haven't done this for a long, long time, so, forgive me for not finding a sexier way to put this, but would you like to come in. l can't.
you can't.
as if having a jealous girlie fit on our first date wasn't emasculating enough, l have to get home to my kids.
they need their mum, and I'm it.
that's not emasculating. lt's very sexy.
how sexy？
you have a very nice house.
she says wake up lt's no use breaking down.
I'll keep stealing, breathing her.

l only slept with him last night.
trust me, l am not pregnant.
I'm too old not to have a baby.
obviously you're not too old to have a baby.
no, I'm too old not to have a baby, and this baby connects me forever to a man, who is that man you were talking about. What man？
who you know you'll do whatever they say.
only he's not a man, he's a child really.
a baby. Oh, Jesus.
what are you doing. This helps me.
ls it helping?
not really.
April... Allow me.

what, are you nuts You're pregnant Give me that.
come here.
that's OK, you don't have to do that.
I'm just sitting here.
he lives with his mother. Don't get me started.

you're doing really well.
Hi, Alice. Oh, hello, dear.
hello.
uh, so, how are you

that's too bad.
so, Alice, can Benjamin come out and play?

I'm pregnant.
Oh
Oh, my God
Oh, my God ls it...

what do you want me to say l don't know. What does it mean to you
how do you want to handle it
what do we do now
well, l.. That sort of thing l wanna try to be with you, l guess.
I'm sorry if l didn't instantly come up with a perfect solution to this very complicated situation lt's not complicated I'm having this baby.
you may participate in the raising of this baby.
l can't make you do it, but l would hope that you would wanna be there for the growing up of this person who carries your DNA.
the first doctor's appointment is in two weeks.
I'll see you there, or l won't.
I'm so sorry.
I've never met anyone like you, ever.
I've never been so much myself with anyone.
even these few times we've spent together have felt like...
What？
family. I'm sorry, but it has.
and l know it's fast, but l can only tell you how l feel, and how l feel is that l wanna be near you all the time.
but l have some big decisions to make about how my life's gonna work, and if you'll have me, so do you. Why you talking fast？
Jimmy Ray shouldn't know I'm here.
lf we're gonna be family, he should know he didn't dream you up half-naked in his house.
and besides, he knows you're here.
no, l was very careful to wait till he was a safe distance away.
Hi, Miss Epner.
Hi, Jimmy Ray.
d'you wanna be with him, the better or worse guy ls that someone you wanna be with？
no, it's not. But if it is...
but it's not. Truthfully l wanna be with you.
but being with me is gonna mean being with this.
how pregnant are you？
they said six weeks. Six weeks.
that's what they said, six weeks today.
we met six weeks ago today, actually.
Mm. Which was the day he left.
you made love on the day we met.
Ah... Yeah.
sorry.
what happened
um, I've gotta take a walk.
really. Yes, really.
I'm on the brink of asking you to be with me really, really be with me.
you, who have some other guy's...
your husband's baby in your stomach, your very beautiful stomach.
I've gotta take a walk.
what about your kids. What about them？
who's gonna watch them. You are.
the walk didn't work. Your mother's here.
no, she's not. l told her to wait in the car.
I'm just here if either of you need me.
l can't stand the thought of it.
of me sleeping with my husband.
you slept with your wife, at least twice, you know.
lt's not like the most appetizing thing ever imagined.
no, of course it's not.
Hey.
you're pregnant.
Yes, l am.
way to go.
so now what？
both of them, or neither of them, will show up at the doctor's office.
all l know is, I'll be there.
you don't know how to work a blender
take your hat off.
jeez
hello.
hello. Hello.
how are you. Hi.
Hi. Hello.
sorry.
so... Anyone else coming
no. This is it. No, this is it.
uh, could you lower this, please？
Oh, my God.
this looks really good. I've seen a couple of these.
where did she go. She'll be back.
look at that.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
so, what exactly is.. Sorry.
no, go ahead. No, no, go ahead.
he, or she just looks great.
can l have a look at that before l have to run
she's beautiful.
we made a baby.
you look pretty. lt's the hormones.
whatever.
your back
Yeah.
really
anything. What
do you have anything to say
don't.
l don't know what to say.
Oh. See ya.
l thought we were having dinner after the show.
I'm in trouble.
come with me.
they're ready for you. We're gonna run late today.
OK. I'm panicking.
tell me. l sort of...slept with my husband.
well, almost.
break-up sex, but it's kind of great, right？
don't. Don't be glib about this.
I'm with a man who sees me, really sees me, and somehow still wants to be with me, and l want him and l just blew it.
Oh, God, it's him. l don't suppose you've cheated before.
Mm-mm. Of course not.
with someone who's bad for me. What am l gonna do？
here's what we're going to do. I'm going to go in and rehearse, so everyone knows what they're doing, and then I'm going to send everyone home, and we're going to shoot the show tonight, or in a couple of hours, or maybe never. OK?
thank you. Mm. OK.
Edie, l have to tell you, Sunday nights are about the...
a good question.
shall we make gay marriage a priority during this election, or should we just not take the bait lf Pam dies, what happens to our daughter l have no rights.
Oh, thank you. lt's very scary. Very scary.
at least I'm not one of those insular gay men, who throws himself into his work, and devotes himself to people who can never love him back romantically.
what we want to ask you is, do you think it's right...
lt's so hard for anyone to meet someone.
have you ever seen the show she did on you l can't be around people who have adopted children.
especially girls.
have you ever tried to find her.
endlessly.
on the internet. Um, l put ads in the paper.
do you feel...haunted
Yes.
whenever there are kids around,
I'm always looking for her face.
ln shopping malls, in the parks.
l have something l want to say.
l hadn't planned on doing this, but hearing you speak, it's just something l have to do.
l had a child that l gave up for adoption.
lt was many, many years ago. l was very young.
l tried, God knows, but the year l spent with that child was the scariest, most darkly miserable time of my life.
one minute you're cuddling in a sleeping bag and the next minute, you've ruined the rest of your life.
can you rewind this？
to the beginning. Um, no, just a little.
l tried, God knows, but the year l spent with that child was the scariest...
go back again, just...five seconds.
are you sure？
Yeah, in fact, l don't.. Could you go one sentence back .but the year l spent with that child was the scariest, most darkly miserable time of my life.
finally, l said uncle.
do you think you just hand it over？
you probably put it down somewhere, and the next people come along and pick it up.
Hey, can l find you some dry clothes
you want me to get it lt's me
maybe you'll feel better if you talk to her l can hear you in there.
don't make me bang the door down.
hello. Hi. I've seen your picture.
she doesn't wanna see you right now.
too bad, I'm her mother.
maybe another day would be better.
unless you say no,
I'll leave you alone to have a private conversation.
she's afraid to be left alone with me
I'm not afraid to be left alone.
I'll be on my beeper if you need me.
alan had no right.. Are you capable of telling the truth l was fifteen years old.
that's a little bit older than some of the kids in your school.
your father disappeared.
my father completely turned his back on me.
was l breast feeding？
my mother said l'd ruined my life.
they threw me out l had a bag of clothes and 48 dollars.
l didn't know if rent was $6 or $600
l didn't know how to open a fucking can of soup.
you wouldn't stop crying.
l get it.
l watched the tape. So did millions of others.
well, not millions. How many people watch your show?
did you see on the tape that l went to my father with his grandchild in my belly, and begged him for help, and that he turned me away.
did you see that l never forgave him, that l didn't even go to his funeral.
you just saw the parts that made me look bad.
l thought it was for the best.
like an idiot, l thought it was for the best, and then it was too late.
too late.
like if you had it to do over, it would be different.
you'd sacrifice your fabulous life to sit there with a cranky, moody kid who got sick A lot, by the way.
sore throats, like on fire, ten a year.
you'd sit up till six in the morning, rubbing her down with alcohol, because her fever's around 106, and that's about the time when if you miss the signs, you got a brain-damaged kid for the rest of your life.
you'd get this girl grown up just to let her know that you didn't love her enough.
or the right way.
your mother wasn't perfect.
she told me the truth.
she did her best.
she was there.
just say you wanted a life more than you wanted me.
l wanted a life... more than l wanted you.
hello. Hi, it's me.
listen, that's never gonna happen again.
l really don't think it should.
good. l want to help with all this.
OK.
any thoughts on how
uh.. Wait.
can you say that again, the part about wanting to help l really want to help with all of this. l really, really do.
thank you.
l want that, too.
been scared to death. Sorry.
l imagined you dead on the roadside. Sorry.
l imagined you dead in the arms of a handsome stranger.
french guy, for some reason, which was an even worse image.
l mean.. l said I'm sorry
what. What's going on？
nothing. Something happen.
no. What are you not telling me.
what could l not be telling you?
well, l don't know. Perhaps you don't love me, you made a horrible mistake, and you want to take the whole thing back.
l do love you. l don't wanna take the whole thing back.
listen, some...
l think he dropped something.
you're taking a walk.
what about the kids. What do you care l care. Clearly l do. Go...home
not my home, yours
go l don't have one without you. That's not my problem.
what do you do on these walks. You don't want to know.
Yes, l do. l say all the things l don't say to you.
all the things l spare you from. Like what
like, go to hell Like, get your own children.
and like, what's the matter with you that you don't have children anyway
and like, what kind of mother are you gonna be, if you can walk out on your children without a second thought
you know they're.. What
not your children lt's just possible some of this is what you wanted to say to your wife.
Oh, really, you think so？
do you understand l can't even take a walk lt must be.. Go to hell l don't have to be with you, l don't have to care for you or this godforsaken baby
don't say that. All l have to do, is care for my children until they're old enough to do it for themselves.
l don't even have to like it, or them.
fuck them, and fuck you
so, how long have you guys been dating. Oh, not long.
we had a date tonight and, uh, she works right down the street, so we decided to meet here.
cool.
so, hello, hi, great to see you.
great to see you all. Good to see you.
uh, and you are. Freddy.
Freddy. Well, great.
great. Oh, God, I'm her brother
great. So...shall we. Yes.
and you're at.. Ten weeks
ten weeks.
have you seen these before？My brother's a doctor.
Yeah, l have.
can you tell us what we're seeing
uh, just one moment, please.
any chance we can hear that squishing sound again
that's the best thing l ever heard.
what's happening
what's happening
April...
I'm not seeing a heartbeat.
amein.
hello.
Oh, amein.
how often is she out there
she comes on Fridays a lot, because she knows I'm home.
April...adopt a baby.
how could you. lt's the same.
how would you know. Maybe it's better.
you don't know what it's like to be adopted.
you don't know what it's like to not be adopted.
right?
what's it like lt was exhausting.
lt was embarrassing sometimes.
want me to bring her out some chicken. You can.
why don't you. l would like to forgive her.
I'm tired of being so mad. I've tried. l can't.
make her buy you something.
l beg your pardon. She's loaded.
maybe it'll make you feel better. That's ridiculous.
make her buy me something.
a car. Yours is on its last legs.
a house. A very small house.
make her buy something you really want but can't afford.
I'm here. Ahh
Jesus fucking Christ
sorry. l mean...
Jesus. Hm.
how are you
sick...
every day over what l did to you.
good.
l mean, l think that's probably good.
Yeah, l guess so.
l want you to make it up to me.
this is for me, you understand, not for you, for me.
l think l will be happier in the long run if you try to make it up to me.
OK.
l want you to buy me a baby.
Oh, well, that's easy.
I'm plugged into all kinds of adoption these days.
ln China they're throwing them...
no, l want you to buy me a baby that I'm going to have.
I'm almost forty, so l don't have much time.
lt's very expensive. l want you to pay for it.
after they do it, l have to lie still for two hours.
l hate lying still.
l want you to be there, find ways to help me.
twelve days later, l take a pregnancy test.
five hours after that, l find out.
lf you make one false move, I'll never speak to you again.
lf you don't, then maybe we can be in each other's lives a little.
you understand that's all that's possible right now.
a little.
can l put my pants on " Hair, average."
as opposed to. Thin, thick, or balding.
artistic ability, none.
none. None.
Jesus "How would you describe yourself"
hard working, intelligent, warm, caring, sexy, and contemplative.
I'm keeping this one for me.
you need to just stick it.
thousands of Chinese girls...
I'm not adopting a Chinese baby.
then bend over.
ls there anything l can do. No.
are you ready. Mm-hm.
do you want to pray？
she does that. She prays.
want to say a little prayer or something. No.
I'm so sorry to interrupt. What is the matter with you？
could you uh, give us a minute？
Bernice, listen to me right now. I'm sorry. Just a minute.
just find us when you're ready. We'll be around.
what
why don't you wanna pray. What do you care l don't l don't give a shit, but you do？
you told me that. You pray before you eat a bowl of spaghetti.
and now, right before you do the most important thing you'll ever do in your life, suddenly you're not interested.
this is none of your business.
get out of my way.
say a prayer with me and l will.
l don't want to pray.
one stupid little prayer.
no
move
maybe you just don't want it badly enough.
you have no idea how badly l want it.
then why won't you pray Why？
because I'm not gonna hand this wish over to some...
whatever it is, who's supposed to be loving, who...
who...
l had faith.
l thought...
God was...good.
maybe God is...
what
difficult.
awful.
complicated.
like me lt took the one man on earth who's right for me and l dropped him on his head.
right.
you did.
how are we doing. We're done.
I'm sorry. No problem.
wait.
hear O lsrael the Lord our God
what does that mean？
hear, O lsrael, the Lord our God, the Lord is One.
what does that mean？
listen, O lsrael, the God of Love and the God of Fear are one.
well.
hello.
thank you for seeing me.
you're standing between me and my front door, so, it's literally the least l could do.
l heard what happened.
I'm sorry l called the baby godforsaken.
lt turns out she was.
l miss you.
do you miss me？
what do you want, April l wanna look at you...for a long, long time.
what else？
there's a chance my life may change in a few hours.
lt may not, but it may...
and before it does, l wanna say two things.
l know what l did to you. To you in particular.
like a worst nightmare kind of thing, right l knew that.
even at the time, l knew that.
what else. I'll do it again.
l will. I'll hurt you again and again.
not like that.
you'd have to leave me if l hurt you like that.
lf we were together, you'd leave me if l hurt you like that again, wouldn't you？
Yes. Yes, l would.
good.
but I'll hurt you in other ways.
little ways. l won't mean to, but l will.
and sometimes, l will mean to.
this is quite an offer you've worked up.
you'll hurt me, too, you know. You'll hurt me and change on me.
you might leave me after you promise you won't. How about that l wouldn't. You might.
but l wouldn't. But...
you might.
Yeah, l guess l might.
so
Oh, God. l know.
I'm sorry.
so
just need to get that little wine glass. That's great.
Hey, where's your dad l got her.
I'll see you inside.
there is a Jewish story.
an ordinary Jewish joke.
a father was teaching his little son to be less afraid, to have more courage.
"Jump, " he said, "and I'll catch you."
and the little boy trusted him, and the little boy jumped.
and when his father caught him, he felt filled with love.
and when he didn't, he was filled with something else, something...more.
life.
amein.
I'm gonna let you down, l know that now
make you cry, l know l will
and why should you believe l would never leave
or that I'll be here still
for all the by and by
and hard as we try
the bough breaks and the cradle falls
for everything l do that will tear at you
let me say I'm sorry now
so you could sing our song
you can get it wrong
you can kiss the rock of ages
and in your wildest dreams
you might see between
the liars and the sages
you can walk a while
down the mystery mile
you can beat the drums of freedom
and in love and war
through the rush and roar
you just call 'me like you see 'em
Ooh, yeah, baby l wanna feel my earth turn over, babe ln this hardened winter ground
feel my earth turn over, darling'
till I'm rootless and unbound l wanna feel my body tremble
when there's no one else around
just this cool, clear water running ln this love that I've found
Hey, baby, see how it can be
every time you reveal yourself to me
I'll come running
when l feel my baby calling now lt's like a whisper in the sand
when the softest rain is falling, darling' l will crumble in your hand
then when all that's left is wonder
and no need to understand
well, this cool, clear water running
will be all that l am.
Hey, baby
will be all that l am, all that l am.
it's a book of hate, to wreak revenge on every pompous trembling worm who taps at Mrs Castaway's door.
and you are? Sugar is all there is to my name.
I am going to get well. Even if it kills me.
kindred spirits like yourself are difficult to find.
exclusive patronage of Sugar by me.
I am willing.
your life is going to be very different from now on.
I am not a mad woman!
I expect a full collapse very shortly.
my God, William Rackham. You'll keep me better than you do now!
my angel...
.come at last.
he sleeps so sweetly, like a child, imagining that he is safe.
but I have my dreams also.
dreams of revenge against the men who took my innocence.
this programme contains some strong language and scenes of a sexual nature.
you know, it's been years since I've slept beside a woman all night.
but I must get up. I have to look in at home.
you have so many responsibilities.
Oh, did you make those changes we discussed to the letter?
damn jute merchants.
can't afford to fall out with them. All done.
what is that terrible smell?
my nose is very sensitive at the moment.
if it can distinguish between Lavandula delphinensis and Lavandula latifolia then it can certainly detect...
uh! Dog's mess.
Oh, William, I'm sorry.
St Giles is filthy.
I do wish there was somewhere else we could meet.
I hate dragging you to this plague pit.
you know, I sometimes think it would be a miracle if I'm not carried off by the cholera by the time I'm 25!
don't say that!
really, one forms the slightest attachment to a woman, then...
the letter.
William, forgive me, I was joking.
well, I wish you wouldn't.
goodness, Mrs Rackham. You have been busy.
do you know what this is, Clara?
invitations?
it's forgiveness.
society opening its doors.
I am to be included in the Season.
even Lady Bridgelow, see?
and Mrs Amphlett has invited me to tea next week.
a great change is in the air, Clara!
everything is going to be all right!
Mrs Fox. Henry.
I hope I do not inconvenience you.
not in the least. Forgive all this,
I've become the Rescue Society's unofficial warehouse.
Oh, excuse me.
this is why you did not see me at church today.
forgive me, where is your maid?
I let her go home on the weekends to care for her grandfather.
so, we are alone in the house?
is that...quite decent?
I'm afraid I find cocoa terrifically stimulating.
we are so easily seduced.
are we?
just last week, I was on my way home from visiting a particularly wretched family.
I was tired, discouraged, and I didn't want to walk.
and before I knew what I was doing,
I was in the underground railway, speeding through the earth, mindless of anything except my own pleasure.
and all at the cost of a sixpence.
goodness.
I enjoyed it so much, I missed my stop.
this is how the world will end, Henry.
the Antichrist is our own desires.
you are the early bird.
I have some errands to run.
well, you've time on your hands.
we haven't seen much of Mr Hunt lately, have we?
what is it? A week now?
mr Hunt is a busy man.
Oh, so it seems.
although with what exactly, I'm never certain.
well, you can ask him, next time he comes.
just so long as you parted from him on good terms, hmm?
as always.
but what do we care?
I know you're much missed at the Fireside.
do you remember the game we used to play when you were a baby?
on the coldest winter nights,
I'd creep in to your room while you were sleeping, all cuddled up in your blanket, and I'd...
pull it off!
do you remember?
I'd pull it off and I'd say, "That's what God does!
that's what God does.
morning.
morning.
the dagger tip touched tender flesh and yet I hesitated.
was not this man worse than all the rest?
had he not abused my trust and cast me back into the pit of filth?
yet I could not thrust it home.
I put away my trusty blade, fetched poison and the softest cloth.'
sweet dreams, my love.
Mrs Rackham, what is your secret?
my secret? Some new spa, perhaps?
you're looking most terribly well.
Oh, no, no, no, Mrs Amphlett.
well, I was just thinking that you look quite remarkably different from the last time I saw you.
so thin! I hardly recognised you.
you are very kind. Not at all, I'm envious.
I swear by a strict but simple regime of water and green beans, and if I am feeling dizzy, a mouthful of oxtail soup.
but the soup must be very well strained.
I shall remember. No, I shall write this down.
I should caution you that at first you may experience debilitating headaches.
I am already a martyr to headaches!
as we speak, I'm prey to a terrible throbbing.
but there is no need for you to suffer as you do.
here, look...
on bad days, I take a couple of these...
.with a dose of Godfrey's Cordial.
ask your pharmacist.
your doctor would give you a lecture on them...
but trust me
you will hardly know yourself.
well, this is pleasant.
a meal together.
you suggested we have a meal together.
Yes, I did.
bon apetit.
what is it, dear? Green beans.
no, you were just smiling.
well, William...
.the fact is...
.I have a guardian angel.
are you referring to Clara?
no, a real guardian angel.
she watches over us.
I feel her about me all the time.
I think she's from the Convent of Health, you know, the place I go when I'm asleep.
I wasn't aware you were going anywhere, dear, when you were sleeping.
the nuns there are really angels.
I suspected that for a long time.
but what a relief to have proof!
proof?
Yeah, I waved to her and she waved back.
are you not hungry?
he's here!
well, go on, send him up.
he wants you to come down.
he's talking to Castaway.
sugar.
I'm afraid to say, Mr Hunt has had enough of our house.
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr Hunt.
it seems Mr Hunt has other plans for you.
I have missed your company.
it's been difficult getting away.
Agnes is seeing things.
seeing things?
angels in the street.
who else is here?
what is this?
this is yours.
and mine.
I couldn't bear the thought of you living in that filthy part of town any longer.
the bank will send you an allowance.
first payment is here.
you will be independent.
say something! Oh, dear God!
will you miss your looking glass?
why do I need to look at myself when I have you to look at me?
I've instructed Mrs Castaway that nothing in your room be touched until you remove it.
did she seem sorry to see me go?
not in the least!
the old trout knows a good deal when she sees one.
but you need not worry about her any more, nor anyone from your past.
you have a new life, here with me.
taken all your books, I see?
don't forget your bowl.
good bowl, that. Well, I won't need it.
there's a bath at the new place.
who'll take care of your sheets?
I will, I suppose.
that's me out of a job then.
you know, I was thinking, Christopher, that...
I could come back sometimes and you and I could read together.
I will come back for you.
you're leaving us then.
after all these years.
lord knows I tried hard enough to be rid of you once.
no brew so toxic I didn't inflict it upon myself, no bath so scalding I didn't immerse myself in it.
you were indestructible!
let's hope I remain so.
19 years since we embarked on this life together.
six since you tiptoed to my room and told me there was a gentleman come to keep me warm.
Well...Mother, I...
of course, dear.
nothing to hold you here.
onward and upward with Mr Hunt!
I'm afraid I won't see you for a while.
I'm in Dundee until Thursday, and then I've Bodley and Ashwell on the Friday.
I will get away from them as early as I can.
you'll be here?
where else?
believe it or not, Agnes is also out that night!
lady Bridgelow is taking her to the Royal Albert Hall.
goodness, that's a step forward.
Yeah.
too big a step, she thought, but I persuaded her.
the new Verdi.
thank goodness for Cheesman.
at least I know she'll get there and back in one piece.
I-I told you of this new coachman?
I checked his references for you.
of course you did.
she's been marvellous really, considering how she has suffered.
well, perhaps Agnes is stronger than you imagine.
I mean Lady Bridgelow.
she knows better than most the,
spare a coin. Miss, spare a coin?
I just came to pick up my powders, I thought I'd call in.
Oh, that's nice.
can't get your powders in Marylebone then?
well, I daresay I could, but I don't know where or...or who to ask.
got no friends up there?
not that kind.
he's fair to you, then, is he?
clothes don't mean nothing, Sugar.
might beat you with a poker or make you lick his shoes for all that.
no, he's not like that.
well, what mighty good luck.
are you, you know, fond of him?
well, I'm used to him.
and when he's away, like now...
do you miss him? I don't miss HIM.
I miss the world that comes with him.
I'm involved with his business.
it's oddly satisfying.
you still got time for your book?
not as much as I'd hoped.
perhaps got less to avenge now?
no, I don't think that.
not at all.
no harm in getting soft, Sugar.
we all would, given half a chance.
Rackers, buck up!
you look as though you'd rather be tucked up.
I got back from Dundee at four this morning!
Flatelli will soon put the wind in your sails.
we have plans to, er, revive you later, don't worry.
we called on Mrs Castaway this morning.
some lucky gent has taken the legendary Sugar off the market
before we'd had the benefit of her charms.
if you find out who's got her, do tell him we're dying to have a bash.
anyway, we thought a trip to the twins in Drury Lane.
previous engagement.
you are dull, Bill.
but happy.
he's lost his mind.
you haven't been drinking the lavender water?
not everyone can wear white.
no, indeed, Mrs Rackham.
you have to be very thin.
do you think she ever eats?
shall we?
your opinion, Agnes?
I have no opinion. I'd merely like some air.
Oh, goodness, you do look peakish.
lady Bridgelow, your concern for me is false and poisonous.
you are fat and your chin has hairs on it!
Agnes?
Agnes?
Agnes?
Clara?
you must not look at me in the face.
you're not supposed to see me.
is it you?
I'm going to help you, Agnes, but you must not look at my face.
william says you are a trick of my imagination.
I am filthy.
I'm covered in filth.
stand up, stand up.
wrap this round you.
you smell familiar.
now listen,
I need you to walk out of here and turn left.
I'll be watching you, Agnes, but this must be our secret.
do you understand? Otherwise I could get into trouble.
can angels get into trouble?
creatures like us are not supposed to interfere in your world.
I'm watching you, remember.
go on, keep moving.
I do wonder where you can be at this time of night.
Clara!
it's me, William.
Where's Clara?
just outside, don't worry.
how do you feel now, dear?
like a lost bonnet floating along a dark river.
you are so very understanding.
no, no.
I pity her.
we who have uninterrupted health must be thankful for our good fortune.
certainly my dear Albert always urged me to be thankful for it when he was alive.
Oh, my dear Lady Bridgelow.
I should not complain.
I have my son, in whom Albert lives on.
the resemblance is very strong.
I don't doubt it will be the same for you when you have a son.
I dare say it will.
you're visiting my sister?
Yes. I trust she is well.
of course she's not well.
use your sense, man. Don't stay too long and tire her out.
you are perhaps a little pale.
appearances mean so little.
my dear Bertie appeared to be in the pink of health always, yet he is gone and I remain.
Oh, I am so anxious to be well, Henry.
with no children to look after
I have saved all my juices for the cause.
I know the cause is grateful.
I sit here tormented knowing each day that passes one more woman sinks into a life of unbridled vice.
Mrs Fox,
I want you to know that I have myself begun to work in St Giles.
you, Henry? So you must rest easy in the knowledge that a presence is maintained.
I knew that you felt as I do.
I do.
Hello, sir.
want a nice girl, not expensive?
I wish only to talk with you.
very good. Come to my house.
no, no, I mean what I say.
a shilling, just to talk.
what you writing it down for?
Oh, I am temporarily taking over the work of a dear friend in the Rescue Society.
I intend to report back in every detail. nice.
well, you've paid your shilling, don't be shy.
when, if you don't mind, Caroline, did you lose your virtue?
age 16.
to my husband.
to your husband?
Ah, well then you did not lose your virtue.
so you must have left him, then, or been cast out?
he died, sir.
then my little boy followed close behind.
I am deeply sorry.
so, that is when you fell into this way of being?
I didn't fall, I was pushed.
owed the doctor for the child's medicine.
he arranged my start in the profession.
the doctor?
I see.
well, forgive me,
I know a man who runs a great concern.
I could arrange employment for you.
I have employment.
employment by which you would not risk damnation.
I have employment!
you want me to break my health in a dirty factory for two shillings a week to help your friend make his fortune?
now, your shilling's long since up.
Caroline! Do you believe you have a soul?
anything you got, I got, too.
then don't you fear for it?
you know, I fear nothing much because I've loved and I've been loved.
ain't that what a soul's about?
brother? Oh, I need to talk to you, William.
I've only just returned from Birmingham and I've an important appointment I need to make in Marylebone.
it is a confession...
of sorts.
sit down, Henry.
ma'am.
he dresses it up as spiritual poppycock, of course, but the fact is that Henry's on heat and too priggish to admit it.
so how did you advise him?
I simply told him that the feelings he had for Mrs Fox bared all the hallmarks of infatuation and they would simply run their course.
what enthrals us today may simply have no hold tomorrow.
indeed.
poor William.
the whole world runs to you with its troubles.
all except you.
what troubles have I?
I am the luckiest woman alive.
I wish I could just fall asleep here.
well, do.
I have to be up early tomorrow.
I have to go into the lavender fields.
the lavender fields?
where the lavender actually grows?
won't you take me?
I would love nothing more.
but...
I understand.
it's a shame you don't have a chaperone.
some kindly old gent to add a veneer of respectability to the exercise.
I need to pee.
pretend you're at home and do it in your pants.
so kind-hearted.
six shillings and whisky, remember?
enjoy the sunshine.
they claim they've been pruning these bushes for weeks.
yesterday afternoon, more like.
it really is magnificent.
bigger than I'd ever imagined.
what a bonfire this'd make, eh?
actually, we do burn all the plants in their fifth autumn.
the blaze is fragrant enough to cause all of Mitcham to swoon.
I've been looking for you!
give it six months and you'll be out on your arse.
you don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, don't let anything dirty pass your lips.
it is breathtaking.
if only I had a son to leave it to.
dear William.
it suits you, the fresh air.
bleeding again, underneath.
I am certain it's caused by eating.
if I don't eat, I don't bleed, 'but then I get faint and they summon Curlew.
where is my angel?
I have not seen her in so long.
perhaps I have not deserved her.'
some stains you never get out.
thank you.
you may sit up.
I'm afraid all is not as it should be.
your womb has moved.
it's much higher than where it ought to be, which is...
Mrs Rackham, are you looking at anything in particular?
I'm looking for something, Dr Curlew.
what? A sign.
I suggest Agnes take more interest in the household.
next thing I know, she's actually scrubbing.
Curlew's adamant she must be secured.
no.
surely Agnes would never survive an asylum.
I've told him that.
exactly.
awful thing is one day she's normal as you or I and the next...
.she's waving at angels.
how long has Agnes been this way?
if I'm honest, her madness has blossomed since the child.
Agnes lost a child?
no, we have a child.
you have?
Yes.
a daughter, unfortunately.
Sophie.
Sophie.
see very little of her.
the odd glimpse as she's being swept off to church by her nurse.
another looming disaster.
miss Cleave claims that Sophie needs a governess.
does a child of eight need schooling?
a girl, too!
trying to bounce another shilling out of me a week,
I don't doubt.
I wish for all the world I could live with you.
rejoice, Christ exhorts us, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?
it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out...
why, Dr Curlew.
Henry.
I received a message from Mrs Fox today.
indeed?
I gather she is to be sent away to the coast to recover.
she is going to Folkestone, yes.
that much is true.
do you have you any idea how long she'll be there?
I imagine, given my experience of the disease, not long at all.
a couple of months at most.
she'll be gone so long?
well, I...
I shall strive to find ways to pass the time until she's back.
dear God, what is the matter with the men in your family?
do you understand nothing?!
my sister is dying of consumption.
she'll never come back.
Henry?
I hoped it was you.
but what kept you?
nothing kept me.
time passes so slowly for me when I am waiting for you.
Mrs Fox,
I am not worthy.
Oh, but you are... No!
my feelings for you leave me in no doubt
I am not cut out to be a clergyman.
Henry, stop.
I rage to see you punished in this way!
God is bigger than one woman's illness.
you would make the kindest, sincerest, handsomest minister.
forgive me.
are you quite sure you won't join us this evening, Agnes?
I know how fond you are of Henry.
dr Curlew has advised against socialising.
I think he also said it might be better not to spend so much time sitting at the window, dearest.
you don't believe in angels, do you?
no, I don't.
you don't believe in anything except William Rackham.
she's dying, Bill!
no, she's absurdly highly strung and on new medication.
Mrs Fox is dying.
her brother says there's no hope.
she stares into my soul, Bill.
those imploring eyes. You two had...
grown surprisingly close.
her breast heaves.
she pants and clutches at my hand.
how lucky she is to have you to comfort her, Henry.
it is as if...
as if she wants something more from me.
it's not surprising.
I ask myself over and over and over what is it she thinks I can give her?
are you serious?
I have prayed for guidance, night and day!
for pity's sake, Henry!
she wants you to give her a good seeing to!
she wants you to give her a good fucking, Henry!
what sort of a creature...?
I can't stay in this house.
stop tormenting her, Henry!
if she really is dying, just let her feel pleasure at least once!
William, what is it?
I've asked Cheesman to come at dawn.
we will leave for the lavender fields straightaway.
what about... What do I care what people think?
it's my damn lavender field, it's my damn business!
I'm sick of being judged by fools who have no idea how the world works, who have the luxury of a clear conscience because I pay for it on a dirty, daily basis!
Mrs Fox?
you look so well.
of course, Henry.
I'm in heaven.
I can't wait for you to join me.
I want to join you.
I want to...
but we are not married.
there is no marriage in heaven, Henry.
mark 12: 25.
Mrs Fox...
if only I could live with you.
you are such a help to me.
I wish I could help you more.
it's not only Henry and Agnes.
the entire household is out of control.
Agnes' maid treats me with open contempt,
miss Cleave has finally handed notice, so now I have to find a new governess.
are you serious about living with me?
of course I am...
.but it's impossible.
could I not, in fact, live with you as your new governess?
mr Rackham! You're not serious?
I'm sorry. Mr Rackham!
I only thought...
mr Rackham!
sir!
you're wanted, sir, at once!
it's your brother!
are we? Friends?
well, I... I hope so.
mum?
God!
if I don't want to go through with it? Make a decision quickly.
I'm assuming there's been no progress over your getting to America?
I have an appointment for a visa application at the embassy.
he up there on his computer, morning and night.
as you know, obsessive interest in something is typical of Asperger's.
what do you want? I've got nothing! What do you want?
you're the juror here, not me. Yours is the only opinion that matters.
so not in the house where Holly Jackson was murdered?
no.
nor were you ever on Huntley Common, where Rebecca Cheung's body was found?
no, never. Never.
good night.
Tasha...
short for Natasha?
Russian. Love it.
please tell me there were Russians in your family.
all right. There were Russians in my family.
glamorous white Russians?
like...
like Natasha Rostova?
who?
the heroine of War And Peace.
I knew that.
actually, my father's family comes from Lewisham.
and my mother's side is from...
north Wales.
right.
I see I've disappointed you.
do I look disappointed?
we're going to give her a wash now.
of course, of course.
what's the time, please?
it's nearly ten past six.'
the Jury Abolition Bill goes to the vote in the Commons today, with a growing band of critics claiming that it is one public spending cut too many.
the latest high-profile defender of the right to trial by jury is none other than the Archbishop of Canterbury, who's on the phone now.
archbishop, good morning. Good morning.
what is it that has drawn you into the middle of this fierce debate...
goodness, Sunday best?
Yes.
well, I... I offered to take Tahir to the American Embassy today.
it'll be a bit of a dash, mind you, during our lunchtime, so I've booked Jackson to take us there and back.
how very extravagant of you. No, no, no. Not at all.
money well spent.
the least I can do...
to help a charming young man.
and, as you can tell, I've grown rather fond of him. Now...
club tie? Bow tie?
what? What have I done now?
well, some women do regret having an abortion, if not straight away, after they've had it, many years down the line.
often when they've had their first child.
they start to have feelings of anxiety, depression ...
so unexpected, I didn't know what to do,
I really liked my life as it was.
I spent so many sleepless nights just thinking about what would happen ...
sleep disturbance, social problems, relationship issues.
all these are certainly examples of the emotional-health problems of many women encountering...
I never once imagined all the things I would gain.
the happiness, the fulfillment.
Yes, I do.
a number of emotional-health issues exhibited by many women, who have had abortions ...
a sense of fulfillment, of happiness.
it was just the best thing ever ...
...By no means an easy decision, ...but it was the right decision to terminate my pregnancy.
it was my choice. I have absolutely no regrets about my abortion.
why won't you let us call the police?
they might find the boys that did this to you.
but if a crime has been committed, it is your duty to report it.
at least let me call the court, ask them to give you the day off.
No! I'm fine. I keep telling you, I don't want help.
I just want to be normal. Normal people get beaten up!
Yes.
they do.
she's sleeping.
and she's comfortable.
thank you.
thank you.
latte, please, with an extra shot. I'll bring it over.
the more I learn about this case, the more I realise what a bore I am.
I mean, look at them.
the three victims.
all professional, normal women, yet all leading these elaborate secret lives.
I thought I'd lived. I realise I haven't, at all.
I cheated on a boyfriend once.
Yeah, but we've all done that.
taken things we shouldn't have at parties, sometimes.
and maybe shoplifted.
you know, just little things, but it's not quite in the same league, is it?
and then I cheated on the one I was cheating with.
and then I cheated on him, too.
none of them knew about each other.
I kept it up for the whole summer.
juggling and lying.
and playing them off against one another.
which kind of shocked me.
that I could do that.
it's getting a bit heavy, isn't it?
but it's true.
those poor women got attacked in the press, at the time, for being out there, on the net, making themselves available and I remember the coverage.
it was so full of judgment and contempt, as if they were somehow immoral or bad.
but they weren't. They were all perfectly normal women.
with fantasies and desires, just like the rest of us.
they just had the guts...
or the bad luck to act on them.
so what do you shoplift?
mobiles, keys and if you take your shoes off, thank you.
step forward, sir.
onto this side. Up you go.
turn around.
Yes.
what are you doing here?
just thought I'd get here a little early, offer you a few do's and don'ts, in case things get especially rough today.
Why?
are they likely to?
Yeah.
mr Lane, good morning.
good to see you got here safely today, in one piece.
I'm assuming there were no serious accidents on the way.
no-one ran into you? Nothing...
fell from the sky and landed on your head?
my lord. I say this, because if we are to believe what the defence has told us, we should put the Guinness Book of Records on alert, for, Mr Lane, you are clearly the unluckiest man in the world.
I'm going to enjoy this.
everywhere you go, terrible misfortune happens, and none of it your fault.
you are simply, as my learned colleague informed us a 'perfectly innocent man looking for love'.
am I right?
Yes.
first, a woman you met on the internet and greatly liked,
Holly Jackson, invited you to her house on the...
4th of February, not in the hope of starting a deep and meaningful romantic relationship, as you hoped, but...
merely for extra-marital sex.
something you weren't interested in at all.
am I right? That's correct.
and this was something you could never have seen coming?
even though she'd stated quite clearly in an email exchange only three days prior to your meeting that... 'with the right person, in the right situation,
I could be very naughty'?
I didn't take that seriously.
yes or no?
no.
because you were an innocent man looking for love?
Yes.
and finding that love wasn't on the menu, you made your excuses and left?
correct.
all of which would have been fine, if Ms Jackson had not subsequently been found brutally murdered with you having been the last known person to have visited her.
Yes.
so you can imagine what conclusions these witnesses came to and it wasn't that you were 'a perfectly innocent man looking for love'.
Yes.
my, how the gods have been unkind to you.
God, sir.
single.
one God.
of course. Silly of me.
then came Anna Knight, another woman you met on the internet, who appeared to be after exactly the same thing as you, a committed relationship, but who rejected you after just one meeting.
what bad luck. Yes.
bad enough to want to follow her and find out why.
only to discover that her motives were no purer than Ms Jackson's.
she was meeting another man.
Yes.
and what extraordinary bad luck that at precisely the moment you decided to follow her and were pinpointed at the scene of the crime by a mobile-telephone call, she was being murdered by a man for whom there is, unfortunately, not a single...
shred of evidence.
is this...
really true?
Yes.
I suppose one shouldn't be surprised, then, that this run of inexplicably bad luck should continue with the third victim, Rebecca Cheung, where, once again, you happened to be the last person she arranged to meet before she died.
is that really correct?
Yes.
made worse on this occasion by several witnesses who recalled seeing a person matching exactly your description at The Green Man pub with the victim the evening before she died.
a meeting you told the police never happened.
now further compounded by the extraordinary misfortune that the CCTV cameras, which just happened to catch you going home, infuriatingly cut out on a time lapse at all the worst moments and, therefore, don't show you
not hailing the minicab and NOT getting into the car.
instead they show you talking to the driver, the car doubling back, the car overtaking Rebecca Cheung and stopping 300 yards ahead, leading people to the inconvenient, but inescapable conclusion that you were actually in that taxi and lying in wait for Rebecca Cheung before murdering her.
we've already explained ... Correct?
yes or no?
I didn't hail that taxi.
answer the question! Correct or not?
Yes, it's correct!
all right? Everything you say is correct!
now perhaps you actually want to ask a few questions to which you DO want to know the answer, instead of all this rhetorical crap, with your smart-arse voice and your raised bloody eyebrows!
mr Lane! It's a total disrespect to me and a total disrespect to the family of the victims.
is that so?
members of the jury, the day I am admonished for disrespecting the victims' families...
by the man who stands accused of murdering them...
is a sad day indeed.
thank you, Mr Lane.
no further questions.
well, well, where is he? Over there.
Jackson, Tahir. Good afternoon, sir.
well, go on. Get in.
I will do. Thanks very much. Bye-bye.
mr Tackana?
Takana.
take a seat.
OK. How are you today, sir? Fine. Thank you.
my, we have a lot of notes on you.
OK. Let me see...
five years ago, you applied for an I-130.
is that correct?
an immigration visa based on the fact that you have a family member in the United States? Yes.
so why has it taken that long?
OK. I can see why.
it went from USCIC headquarters in DC, then it was referred to the National Visa Center in New Hampshire.
Yes. So?
And?
do you want the long version or the short version?
short, dear. I'm an old man.
there may not be time for the long version.
I'm in.
the New Hampshire Head Office decided my circumstances were exceptional and my application should be expedited.
well... that's wonderful!
well done, you!
America!
wonderful!
living In America
you've been in a lot lately.
have I made an impression on you, then?
no. I just wondered if you'd be interested in our '12 for the price of 10' saver pack?
no, thanks.
I'm almost done.
we had a lord, a penniless one, with substance-abuse issues, if his skin was anything to go by.
there was a scientist, who'd done important work with pacemakers.
an Armenian, who didn't speak a word of English.
a woman, who'd just had a boob job, and was keeping low until the stitches were out.
there was an old lady, deaf as a post.
like you say, 'Liquorice Allsorts'.
and, miraculously, all of one mind.
Yes.
so how long did it take you to reach the verdict?
two, three hours.
quick.
it was just so clear-cut and so utterly straightforward.
and don't forget, we still had that piece of evidence to help convict him.
unlike you.
you'll have a much tougher job.
that piece of evidence?
right.
well, don't tell me.
you know I can't.
it was ruled inadmissible by the Court of Appeal.
although why... I'll never know.
you don't think it should have been?
no.
well, I'd still prefer it if you didn't tell me.
what you don't know can't hurt you.
right, because what if I told you and it were to influence you?
and then you would influence your fellow jurors.
it could change everything.
you really think it could?
it's that powerful?
this turns everything on its head.
one could argue, that if it really is that powerful, you have a responsibility to tell me.
I have a right to know.
I suppose one could argue that.
you can trust me.
I promise.
OK.
you didn't hear this.
the first victim Holly Jackson.
where Alan always insisted he never went into her bedroom, where the murder took place. Right.
well...
in that bedroom, there was a brown throw.
an open-weave, fringed trim, two metres by one metre.
right. From Marks & Spencer's.
I even remember the price.
well...
the police found traces of it in Lane's car.
what?
it was the key piece of evidence in the first trial.
the prosecution's entire case was based on it.
so why is it no longer admissible?
you have to give Alan's legal team credit.
they kept digging and digging away.
until they found something.
what did they find?
you won't believe it.
the same forensics officer that examined Alan Lane's car had come from a domestic burglary earlier that day.
and...
it turns out, by some freak coincidence...
the owners of the house had exactly the same throw on their sofa that Holly Jackson had on her bed.
in the Court of Appeal, the forensics officer swore, under oath, he'd never set foot in the sitting room, but, because he couldn't prove that contamination hadn't occurred with a fibre becoming attached to his crime-scene bag, as he put it down somewhere in the house or his equipment and then transferred it to Alan Lane's car, the verdict was thrown out.
do you know how well these officers are trained?
how experienced this one was?
there is no way on earth that Alan Lane's car was contaminated by fibres from another crime scene.
that was Holly Jackson's throw.
but all that remained was for independent forensics analysis to show that the fibres from the two throws really were identical.
that was enough to show that it really could, in theory, have come from the earlier crime scene.
and the case was headed for retrial.
and now he'll almost certainly get off.
God.
there.
now you know.
don't you wish you didn't?
or that we'd never bumped into one another.
or started talking.
that we had never met. No, no, no. No.
no, I'm... I'm glad.
what are you going to do?
I don't know.
come on. We should get back. It's the summing up.
you go ahead.
I'll be right there.
it's done.
good. How do you feel?
terrible.
you know why you're doing this. It's the right thing. We all agreed.
I know.
I just didn't expect to...
like him.
mr Mallory?
members of the jury...
enough.
it is a measure of the sophistication of the society we live in that we have even come thus far.
that a trial such as this should been queried and appealed and retried and that is a society I am proud to live in, but...
enough now.
I accept that we do not have any direct evidence of Alan Lane's guilt.
no CCTV camera catching him in the act or a witness, who was in the actual room, but, let's face it, we do have everything else and when you take...
it's true.
we do have a legal system that is nobly predicated upon the presumption of innocence.
instead, Alan Lane has been subjected to a relentless presumption of guilt.
a shocking collusion between our media, our judiciary and law-enforcement agencies that has resulted in an abject miscarriage of justice that should shame us all Do not be fooled by this.
alan Lane, as you have seen for yourselves in this trial, with shocking clarity, is a man with an explosive temper and a disturbing history of violence...
...from the minute Alan Lane was wrongfully arrested, he was grotesquely daubed a weirdo...
inside the house, in the back of the taxi, I ask you, is there really anyone here who really believes any...
he was denied a fair investigation.
he was denied a fair hearing.
he was denied a fair trial...
alan Lane was the last person to see all three victims alive...
Why? Because... .he was also the first person to see all of them dead... we all wanted this case closed.
because we were uncomfortable with what it said about us.
our secret lives, our fears and frustrations and our loneliness.
so I look to the 12 of you to restore all our pride in the judicial system and the public's faith in trial by jury.
by returning the right verdict, here today.
right. Members of the jury, there you have it.
the time has come for you to retire and consider your verdict.
you should strive to reach a unanimous one.
you must also choose a foreman to preside over your deliberations.
it would be best if you did that straightaway.
if you follow the usher, he will take you to the jury room.
right, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm going to need all mobile phones, please, pagers, BlackBerries.
I'd also like to draw your attention to the bell.
if you need anything ... food, drink, visit to the toilets.
exhibits will be brought to you, as and when.
you also have fresh coffee and tea in the Thermos.
any questions?
right. Well, good luck.
well, perhaps I should start the ball rolling.
we heard the judge.
we'd better elect a foreman.
now, I...
I suggest that those of you who want to be considered as jury foreman put themselves forward by raising their hands now.
Yeah, I don't mind.
me, too. Right.
I...
I suppose we could have speeches and ballot papers, but I think that's going too far.
our time is too precious, so...
I suggest that the three candidates turn their backs and...
the rest of us vote for our choice.
yeah?
so let's start.
those of us who want...
Ann.
Ann, vote now.
and those of us who want...
Derek.
vote now.
and those of us who want ... Paul.
Paul.
and the result is...
paul ... narrowly.
well, thank you.
thank you, everybody who voted for me.
is that what one says? Who knows?
well, I notice it's quarter to five already and we've had a long day.
how would everybody feel if we started in earnest tomorrow?
good idea. Fine by me.
we could always have a quick vote now. What do you think?
on what?
just to see where we stand.
who knows? We might already have a unanimous verdict.
we could wrap it up by tonight.
I somehow doubt that. Why not?
the way that nutter went off in court today,
I thought we were going to have a fourth murder on our hands.
OK.
all those who find the defendant guilty as charged, raise your hands.
and who finds him innocent?
any abstentions?
well... we have a hung jury.
surprise, surprise.
a seriously well-hung jury.
then that is the challenge facing us.
to get one camp to persuade the other, until we reach unanimity.
tomorrow will be an eventful day. I suggest we get all the rest we can.
how about an earlier start? Nine o'clock?
see you then.
aye, aye, skipper.
see you tomorrow. All right. Take care. See you tomorrow.
well done. OK.
see you tomorrow.
see you tomorrow.
Heathrow? Yeah.
Tahir, hey! Hey.
hello.
he's coming!
And? We've been waiting all day.
they said yes!
it's very cold in Nebraska.
he'll need a proper snow-proof coat, won't he? Definitely!
and gloves.
Yes, here we are. Thick gloves.
and a hat?
he'd want one of those.
beautiful.
my!
will you look at these?
goodness!
I've driven tractors with less tread than these!
and feel that fur.
I'm guessing a nine.
don't close yet! Here we are!
excuse me, I was wondering...
I've written postcards and I was wondering ... Sorry.
excuse me. I see you're going to Sardinia.
no. Sorry. No.
excuse me.
I was wondering if you could send these postcards.
it's nothing dodgy and you get ten quid for the trouble.
Thanks. Thank you.
I really appreciate that. Thanks. Thanks.
hello. Hello.
hello.
can I speak to Sadam?
Hello?
hello.
Hey, it's me!
who?
it's me. Tahir!
Hey, Baby Brother!
I got it!
got what?
the Visa. I got it! I'm coming!
that's fantastic.
aren't you happy for me?
I am...
...I am happy for you.
but you may be surprised...
...It's very cold.
but hot in summer!
I'm married to an American now.
...who never really liked the guys...
so I don't see any of the boys from back home any more.
...of course I'll put you in touch with them...
we'll all go for a beer.
a beer? Since when do you drink beer?
I needed to make a few changes...
to fit in...
like my name. It's David now.
David?
yes... You'll see.
america's great!
but money is tight and people are scared and it's hard enough making a living out here as a Black East African, without being a Muslim called Sadam.
listen, I gotta go.
so, out of nowhere, one of the jurors comes up with the idea of a snap vote.
suddenly, I have to come up with a verdict.
which way did you go?
well, I didn't. I abstained.
Why? You must have an opinion.
I do. Of course I do.
but it's not my opinion that's important, is it? It's yours.
but I'm not in the jury room, you are.
but only as you, there to deliver your vote.
I keep telling you, which is why you've got to do the work.
God, the burdens of responsible citizenship.
I pay my taxes. I recycle my rubbish. Isn't that enough?
joke!
come on. Let's do it!
so explain this, triangulation thing again?
that's just the cell-site analysis.
and the difference between a subdural haematoma and a diffuse axonal injury is...?
one's from a blow to the head, the other's from strangulation.
she said, sounding like she knows which is which.
I've got a friend who's a doctor, I'll give them a ring.
and I need more wine.
me, too.
he did do it, didn't he? Is that what you think?
isn't that what you think? That's not the point.
I'll get the wine.
another bottle, please.
over there. Over there? Right.
...has caused much public debate.
well, the debate itself is predicted to run late into the night.
if MPs vote in favour of the bill, then it is widely thought that this vote could kick-start a radical overhaul of what critics have been calling 'an outdated, inefficient and unreliable institution'.
a growing number of defenders of the jury service are calling it 'one public spending cut too many'.
we can now cross live to our political correspondent ...
you're up, huh?
surprise.
came back a few days early.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
what the hell's been going on?
I'm sorry.
the third act of Cousin Kate was well-advanced by the time Mrs Moore re-entered the club.
windows were barred, lest the servants should see their memsahibs acting...
and the heat was consequently immense.
one electric fan...
revolved like a wounded bird, another was out of order.
disinclined to return to the audience, she went into the billiard room, where she was greeted by, 'I want to... '
see the real India.'
what do I do, Mum?
what do I do? Do I tell them?
good night.
fifty quid says you're back here tonight.
you have put me in a terrible position.
knowing what I now know I should report you to the authorities.
she's got the hots for him, hasn't she?
how dare you!
I wish you'd thought longer and harder about the implications of what you've just done.
well, this is information which puts a completely different perspective on the case.
good luck.
do you find the defendant guilty...
or not guilty?
the mentalist n.
someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of thoughts and behavior ??
but from where I'm not sure.
she ??
and who were you exactly ?
my name ?
I ??
I' m sorry ??
at my house ??
you??
you??
I don't know. I'm really ??
for the energy ???
uhu ... okay, so ??
I didn't know her husband ???
okay I got it um . ??
or SHE'S INVOLVED IN THIS MURDER.
so YOU GOT A CHOICE. YOU CAN CALL GHOSTBUSTERS
or WE CAN TAKE THIS LADY DOWNTOWN.
miss FRYE, WOULD YOU MIND COMING INTO OUR OFFICE IN THE MORNING
and ANSWERING A FEW MORE QUESTIONS IN DETAIL? IF I COULD BE OF ANY HELP, I'D BE GLAD TO.
please CALL ME KRISTINA.
where IS ALL THIS ANGER I FEEL COMING FROM?
not FROM ME. MAYBE YOU'RE PROJECTING.
no. ROSEMARY WAS MY FRIEND.
am I SAD? OF COURSE. AM I ANGRY?
only THAT SOMEBODY WOULD DO SUCH A TERRIBLE THING TO HER.
don't TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,
but YOU ARE impolitely MISREADING THE SITUATION.
I AM, AM I? OH, THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD.
how LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ROSEMARY TENNANT?
almost THREE YEARS.
do YOU CHARGE FOR YOUR SERVICES? YES. HOW MUCH DEPENDS ON THE RESOURCES OF THE INDIVIDUAL CLIENT, BUT I NEVER TURN ANYONE AWAY. HOW MUCH DID YOU CHARGE ROSEMARY?
$500 PER HOUR. HOW MANY HOURS A WEEK?
five TO SIX.
Oh, 3 GRAND A WEEK. NICE.
rosemary WAS A TROUBLED SOUL.
she NEEDED INTENSIVE HELP.
what WAS TROUBLING HER?
her HUSBAND WAS A POWERFUL ANCHOR IN HER LIFE.
after HIS DEATH, I THINK SHE FELT ADRIFT, VULNERABLE.
and PEOPLE THAT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUSTED
recognized HER WEAKNESSES AND PLAYED ON THEM. OH, REALLY?
any PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR?
too MANY TO MENTION.
as A RESULT,
I THINK HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER CHILDREN MAY HAVE SUFFERED.
that WOULD BE CLARA AND TRAVIS, YES? MM-HMM.
suffered HOW?
I'm SORRY.
I'm NOT COMFORTABLE SHARING ANY MORE THAN THAT WITH YOU. MM.
Travis WENT MISSING SEVERAL DAYS AGO.
what DID SHE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT? TRULY, I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU,
but MY PRACTICE IS BOUND BY THE SAME CLIENT CONFIDENTIALITY CODES THAT ALL DOCTORS ABIDE BY. YOU HAVE A PROFESSIONAL THERAPIST'S LICENSE
with THE STATE? YES, I DO.
your CLIENT'S DEAD. HER EARTHLY VESSEL IS DEAD.
when HER SOUL COMPLETES ITS JOURNEY, I COULD ASK HER
if IT'S ALL RIGHT TO SHARE HER PROBLEMS WITH YOU IN MORE DETAIL.
I RECORDED ALL OF OUR SESSIONS ON CD.
if SHE SAYS YES, I'LL GIVE THEM TO YOU.
why BOTHER WITH THAT? WHY NOT JUST ASK HER WHO KILLED HER?
of COURSE I WILL, BUT SHE MAY NOT KNOW.
death DOESN'T GRANT OMNISCIENCE.
you're GOOD. I LIKE TO THINK SO.
Yes, YOU DO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOVE ONE'S SELF.
how DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF? OH. YOU TELL ME.
and FORGET ABOUT THE $500 AN HOUR.
I'm ON CIVIL SERVICE PAY.
okay, FOR FREE THEN.
I THINK YOU ACT ASSURED AND ARROGANT,
but INSIDE YOU ARE TROUBLED
with DEEP GUILT AND SELF-LOATHING.
a RECENT TRAUMA IN YOUR PAST PERHAPS?
but YOU'RE MORE THAN A LITTLE UNSTABLE.
you HAVE YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU.
you ARE GOOD.
please. NOT TO BOAST,
but I AM QUITE A WELL-KNOWN HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.
a MERE HALF-HOUR ON THE INTERNET
would TELL YOU THAT I'M CONSUMED WITH GUILT AND SELF-LOATHING.
one LOOK IN YOUR EYES WOULD TELL ME THAT.
and WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WOULD SPEND ANY TIME RESEARCHING YOU ON THE INTERNET?
a LITTLE SELF-INVOLVED MAYBE?
may I GO?
Yes. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
feel FREE TO CALL ME ANY TIME. WE WILL.
what?
do WE KNOW WHO'S HOME?
until TWO DAYS AGO,
the RESIDENTS WERE TRAVIS TENNANT, ROSEMARY TENNANT
and A SEMIPERMANENT HOUSEGUEST, NAME OF JEREMY HALE,
portrait PHOTOGRAPHER AND MRS. TENNANT'S BOYFRIEND,
according TO THE GARDENER AND POOL GUY.
Dooley. DOOLEY, COME HERE.
can I HELP YOU? MR. HALE?
Yes. CALIFORNIA BUREAU INVESTIGATION.
you MIND IF WE COME IN? NO, NOT AT ALL.
uh, SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.
looks LIKE YOU WEREN'T ALONE LAST NIGHT.
well, I WAS AT A, UH, GALLERY OPENING,
but SOMEONE'S ALWAYS HERE.
Rosie LIKED TO HAVE PEOPLE AROUND,
and, WELL, YOU KNOW US CREATIVE TYPES
any CHANCE TO, UH, PUT OFF WORK.
how LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE?
uh... GOING ON SIX MONTHS.
I'm A, UH, A PHOTOGRAPHER,
and I MET ROSEMARY AT A SHOW.
I CAME TO DO A PORTRAIT,
and THEN I GLUE WE JUST KIND GELLED, AND I NEVER LEFT.
so YOU AND MRS. TENNANT WERE LOVERS?
that's WHAT EVERYONE SAYS.
did I LOVE HER AND VICE VERSA, YES. BUT LOVERS?
we WERE CLOSE. SHE UNDERSTOOD ME BETTER THAN ANYONE.
living HERE,
you MUST HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW HER KIDS PRETTY WELL.
Clara's ALL GROWN UP. DIDN'T COME AROUND MUCH ANYMORE.
and TRAVIS-- THAT KID HAS SOME PROBLEMS.
how SO?
I THINK AFTER HIS DAD DIED, HE JUST LOST IT
on DRUGS, STEALING STUFF, ACTING OUT IN CRAZY WAYS.
when WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM? OVER A WEEK AGO. Rosie FOUND DRUGS IN HIS BEDROOM.
they HAD A BIG FIGHT. HE SPLIT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE.
he's GOT A HUNDRED CRAZY FRIENDS TO HIDE OUT WITH. EXCUSE ME. UH, DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK AROUND?
no. GO FOR IT.
thank YOU.
rosemary PUT YOU IN HER WILL A FEW MONTHS BACK, DIDN'T SHE?
Yeah, AND I FELT BAD ABOUT THAT, ACTUALLY. IT'S TOO MUCH.
but ROSEMARY WAS SUCH A GENEROUS PERSON,
and TO REFUSE HER GENEROSITY WOULD BE TO, YOU KNOW,
deny HER ESSENCE. THE DAY BEFORE SHE DIED,
she MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER ESTATE LAWYER,
told HIM SHE WANTED TO MAKE FURTHER ALTERATIONS TO THE TRUST. REALLY? I HAD NO IDEA.
what DO YOU THINK THAT WAS ABOUT? I COULD ONLY IMAGINE IT HAS TO DO WITH TRAVIS.
cut HIM OFF, AND MAYBE IT WOULD STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT.
Oh, YOU FOUND MY STUDIO.
she WAS QUITE BEAUTIFUL, WASN'T SHE?
you REALLY CAPTURED SO MUCH IN HER EYES.
it's LIKE SHE'S TALKING TO US. ROSEMARY WAS AN EASY SUBJECT,
and THOSE PHOTOS STILL DON'T DO HER JUSTICE. THIS IS QUITE A SETUP.
Mm. DARKROOM, STATE-OF-THE-ART EQUIPMENT.
it's NICE TO HAVE A BENEFACTOR. I'M BLESSED.
or CLEVER.
you SAY THAT TRAVIS LEFT BECAUSE HE AND HIS MOM HAD A FIGHT.
are YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? WELL, OF COURSE. I WAS THERE.
I THINK MRS. TENNANT TURNED A BLIND EYE TOWARDS HER SON'S PROBLEMS BECAUSE HE LOST HIS DAD.
he DIDN'T LEAVE BECAUSE OF HER. HE LEFT BECAUSE OF YOU.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I THINK THIS WAS TRAVIS' ROOM.
there's OLD POSTER TAPE HERE ON THE WALLS
there's STICKERS BEHIND THIS DOOR
and... DENTS...
up HERE, FROM WHERE A LACROSSE BALL WAS HITTING IT.
Travis PLAYS LACROSSE, DOESN'T HE?
he USED TO BEFORE HE GOT INTO DRUGS. AND HERE--THIS PANE OF GLASS HAS A CRACK IN IT,
right AT ELBOW OR FIST HEIGHT.
must HAVE BEEN QUITE THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN YOU TWO.
okay, THAT'S ENOUGH. THE ONLY QUESTION IS, DID YOU TAKE HIS ROOM AS SOON AS HE LEFT
or DID HE LEAVE BECAUSE YOU TOOK HIS ROOM?
you're IN MY PERSONAL SPACE. PLEASE STEP BACK.
excuse ME.
so YOU KICK HIM OUT OF HERE, HE HAS TO FIND SOMEPLACE SAFE,
someplace TO HIDE WHERE CHANGE CAN'T FIND HIM.
so WHERE'D HE GO?
he WAS HAPPY IN A SMALLER ROOM.
Yeah, I BET.
excuse me. BUT THERE'S A DEFINITE NOTE OF UNCALLED FOR HOSTILITY IN YOUR VOICE.
What--what IS THAT ABOUT?
he's JUST TRYING TO DO HIS JOB.
I KNOW TRAVIS TENNANT IS SUSPECT NUMBER ONE,
but JEREMY ISN'T EXACTLY GRIEVING RIGHT NOW.
I'll DO SOME DIGGING ON HALE, SEE WHAT I COME UP WITH.
who's TO SAY THE KID'S NOT DEAD?
maybe HE KILLED BOTH OF THEM. MORE MONEY IN THE WILL FOR HIM.
anything ON THE BUSINESS SIDE? WELL, THE PSYCHIC WAS RIGHT.
every HIGH-END CON ARTIST AND SOCIAL PARASITE IN TOWN
was HITTING SEMARY UP FOR A MILLION.
these GUYS ARE ALL WHITE-COLLAR LEECHES, NOT MURDERERS. THIS LOOKS LIKE HER.
miss TENNANT, I'M AGENT LISBON. THANK YOU FOR COMING.
I CAME AS SOON AS I COULD.
has ANYONE FOUND MY BROTHER?
please HAVE A SEAT.
we're SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
to ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, NO. TRAVIS IS STILL MISSING.
but WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FIND HIM.
can YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?
anything MIGHT HELP.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S GONE.
I MEAN, SHE WAS SUCH A GOOD PERSON.
everybody LOVED HER, AND...
for HER TO DIE IN THE GUTTER LIKE THAT, IT'S...
like GARBAGE, IT'S--IT'S HORRIBLE.
people SAY SHE CHANGED AFTER YOUR FATHER DIED.
she...
she SORT OF LOST CONTROL.
and MY FATHER WAS...
the ONE THAT KEPT IT ALL GOING.
and SHE JUST...
she WASN'T THAT PERSON.
could YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE?
when I WAS IN COLLEGE...
my BROTHER CALLED TO TELL ME
that PEOPLE WERE RIPPING US OFF.
and MOM WOULD INVEST IN ONE BAD SCHEME AFTER ANOTHER,
and I TRIED TO WARN HER, BUT SHE JUST WOULDN'T LISTEN.
I'm SURE SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING.
is THAT WHEN YOUR BROTHER STARTED ACTING OUT?
he MISSED DAD A LOT,
and SUDDENLY...
he WAS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE,
and I THINK HE JUST WASN'T USED TO IT.
that's WHEN JEREMY MOVED IN,
and HE'S SCARY. HE'S VERY DANGEROUS.
dangerous HOW?
he WANTS WHAT HE WANTS, AND HE HAS A VERY BAD TEMPER.
I WAS WORRIED FOR MY MOM.
clara, WHERE DO YOU THINK TRAVIS IS?
if I KNEW, I WOULD BE WITH HIM.
I MEAN, HE'S MY BROTHER.
he's... HE'S ALL I'VE GOT LEFT.
could YOU PUT HIS NUMBER IN THERE, PLEASE?
well, HE'S NOT GONNA CALL YOU BACK. EH, JUST PUT IT IN.
thank YOU.
Hello, TRAVIS.
you DON'T KNOW ME, BUT MY NAME IS PATRICK JANE.
I'm A FRIEND. I KNOW YOU'RE IN A LITTLE TROUBLE RIGHT NOW,
and I WANT TO OFFER YOU SOME PEACE OF MIND.
but I DON'T KNOW WHAT PEACE OF MIND MEANS TO YOU.
it's DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE.
for INSTANCE, I LIKE RIDING HORSES.
but WOULD HORSES MAKE YOU HAPPY? I DON'T KNOW.
why WOULDN'T HORSES MAKE YOU HAPPY?
go ROUND AND ROUND IN YOUR MIND UNTIL YOU'RE SURE,
and GO TO THAT PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW YOU ARE HAPPY.
then GIVE ME A CALL. YOU HAVE MY NUMBER.
what WAS THAT ABOUT?
quick. WHAT IMAGES CAME INTO YOUR HEAD?
all I'M SAYING, YOU CAN'T SAY THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS PSYCHICS JUST 'CAUSE YOU'VE NEVER MET ONE. YOU'RE RIGHT.
I've NEVER SEEN A ZEBRA. DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T EXIST. YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A ZEBRA?
no. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A ZOO?
you KNOW, I DON'T GET ZOOS.
you PAY MONEY TO LOOK AT ANIMALS. WHY?
guys.
that's HIM.
Jane, I'LL NEVER DOUBT YOU AGAIN.
you EVER DOUBTED ME?
one DOLLAR HERE. ONE DOLLAR.
Travis, WAIT.
just WAIT.
Travis WE KNOW WHY YOU TOOK OFF.
we KNOW ABOUT YOUR FIGHT WITH JEREMY.
why DIDN'T YOU CALL SOMEBODY? WHY JUST RUN?
cause THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THEY COULD DO.
I DIDN'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY MORE TROUBLE.
cause ANY TROUBLE FOR WHO? THEY'RE YOUR FAMILY.
you REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
look, I LOVED MY MOM... SO MUCH.
but AFTER THE BLOWOUT WITH JEREMY,
I COULDN'T GO BACK THERE. THERE WAS NO WAY.
when CAN I SEE HIM?
Oh, SOON.
so WHERE'D YOU GO? FRIENDS' HOUSES MOSTLY.
we'll NEED NAMES AND ADDRESSES.
you KNOW, MAYBE IF I'D BEEN HOME THAT NIGHT,
she'd STILL BE ALIVE.
I... MAYBE
here's THE TRUTH, TRAVIS.
after YOUR DAD DIED, YOUR MOM GAVE AWAY A LOT OF YOUR MONEY.
then SHE MOVED JEREMY INTO THE HOUSE
and MADE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE. SO EVEN THOUGH YOU TOOK OFF,
you KNEW WHERE SHE'D BE THAT NIGHT. YOU KNEW HOW SHE'D WALK HOME.
are YOU SAYING I DID THIS?
when MY DAD DIED, MOM WAS ALL I HAD.
you DON'T THINK I WANTED TO BE THERE FOR HER?
that DIRT BAG JEREMY MOVES IN, HE STARTS TELLING ME WHAT TO DO
and BOSSING ME AROUND.
she WAS MY MOM. I DIDN'T KILL HER.
I BELIEVE HIM.
come HERE.
we'll BE ALL RIGHT.
we'll BE FINE.
Travis IS HURTING. OR HE'S LYING. LET'S NOT FORGET,
Jeremy HALE STOOD TO INHERIT A FEW MILLION HIMSELF.
so MAYBE HE WANTED TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS
finance A NICE LONG PHOTO SHOOT IN SOUTH AMERICA,
lay LOW FOR AWHILE? I HEARD FROM ROSEMARY'S PROBATE LAWYER.
guess WHO SHE JUST ADDED TO HER WILL. UH, KRISTINA FRYE?
ink WASN'T EVEN DRY YET. KRISTINA TOLD US SHE KNEW IN ADVANCE
that ROSEMARY WAS IN DANGER.
why WOULD SHE TELL US THAT IF SHE'S GUILTY?
how DIABOLICALLY CLEVER OF HER-- MAKE US DISMISS HER AS A SUSPECT
because SHE MADE HERSELF LOOK LIKE ONE.
or MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, SHE HAS A RARE AND PRECIOUS GIFT
and IS TRYING TO HELP US.
a RARE AND PRECIOUS GIFT.
tell ME... WHO GETS THESE GIFTS ANYHOW?
and HOW COME NO ONE EVER HAS THE GIFT
for SEEING HORSE RACE RESULTS?
and HOW COME DEAD PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK SUCH TEDIOUS DRIVEL?
play NICE. VAN PELT'S ENTITLED TO HER OPINION.
not IF IT'S WRONG. THIS IS LIKE BELIEVING IN THE EASTER BUNNY.
who SAYS THERE'S NO EASTER BUNNY?
van PELT. OH, HI.
Wow. THANKS.
got IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT OVER.
that WAS KRISTINA. SHE SAID SHE'S PICKING UP ON SOMETHING.
Ooh. SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HELP US.
why DON'T YOU GO TALK TO HER? I'M COMING.
does HE HAVE TO? IF SHE'S CONNING US, WE NEED TO KNOW.
she ISN'T. I CAN TELL. BEHAVE.
miss FRYE?
be RIGHT THERE. TAKE A SEAT, PLEASE.
Madame ZOLTAR WELCOMES YOU.
Mm. I SMELL DEAD PEOPLE.
Jane, SHH.
look, YOU CAN DO ALL YOUR HOLIDAY SHOPPING RIGHT HERE.
aren't YOU THE LEAST BIT INTERESTED IN WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY?
no. I LOVE THE MIRROR, THOUGH. CONVENIENTLY LOCATED, ISN'T IT?
what DO YOU MEAN? IT'S 1-WAY GLASS-- TEXTBOOK CLAIRVOYANT TRICK.
she STUDIES HER CLIENT'S BODY LANGUAGE BEFORE THEY COME IN.
come ON. SHE'S PROBABLY WATCHING US RIGHT NOW.
you CAN'T GO IN THERE. SURE, I CAN.
see? OH, MAYBE IN THIS INSTANCE,
but NOT AS A GENERAL OBSERVATION.
shall WE SIT DOWN?
sure.
you KNOW WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH?
enlighten ME.
you TALK SUCH A GOOD HIGH-CLASS GAME,
but YOUR TEMPLE
looks LIKE A DISCOUNT SOUVENIR STORE IN SHANGRI-LA.
well, CERTAIN IMAGERY GOES WITH THE TEITORY.
you KNOW THAT.
people EXPECT A LITTLE RAZZMATAZZ,
like THE SHINY SUITS YOU USED TO WEAR.
he SAYS...
I'm SORRY FOR ALL THE PAIN I CAUSED YOU AND YOUR MOTHER.
they're TEARS OF JOY.
so YOU HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON ME. I HAVE NOW.
red JOHN MURDERED YOUR famliy. I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
is THAT WHY YOU GAVE UP YOUR CALLING? CALLING? IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
Yeah, CALLING, GIFT, AS YOU LIKE.
there's NO DOUBT THAT YOU HAD THAT. WHY'D YOU GIVE IT UP? IT WAS THE SUITS. CHAFING. HORRIBLE.
always DANCING. WHY IS THAT? DON'T TRY TO COLD READ ME.
Oh, I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW. WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S A LIE.
can WE, UM, TALK ABOUT THE CASE?
Yes.
please.
so HAS ROSEMARY CONTACTED YOU YET?
no, NOT YET.
it OFTEN TAKES SOME TIME FOR SOULS TO MAKE A FULL TRANSIT.
Yes, THE CELESTIAL BUS IS RUNNING LATE.
I CALLED TO OFFER YOU MY ASSISTANCE.
clearly YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.
wait. I'M THE AGENT HERE.
we ARE INTERESTED.
I HAD A VISION ABOUT THE CAR USED TO KILL ROSEMARY.
water RUSHING INTO THE WINDOWS, TIRES UNDERWATER,
resting ON CONCRETE.
concrete? LIKE A SWIMMING POOL?
um, BIGGER.
a RESERVOIR MAYBE.
there's FOUNDERS LAKE JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN.
Yes, A RESERVOIR.
Thanks.
the DAMAGE TO THE FRONT END IS CONSISTENT WITH A VEHICLE VERSUS PEDESTRIAN COLLISION.
but GET THIS-- THE V. I.N. NUMBER
matches ROSEMARY TENNANT'S OWN REGISTRATION. THAT'S HER CAR?
Yeah, TWO MOVING VIOLATIONS
show THAT TRAVIS USED THE VEHICLE ALL THE TIME. IT COULD HAVE BEEN JEREMY. HE HAD ACCESS TO IT AS WELL.
uh, PUT ONE OF THEM IN THE CAR THAT NIGHT
traffic CAMERAS, WITNESSES AT GAS STATIONS.
if IT EXISTS, I WANT TO KNOW. I'M ON IT.
are YOU GUYS GONNA ARREST TRAVIS TENNANT
or, UH, YOU WANT US TO? I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE,
but EVERYTHING WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL.
well, I GO WITH MY GUT, UH, 90% OF THE TIME.
if IT FEELS RIGHT, IT'S MEANT TO BE. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER 10%?
if ANYONE NEEDS ARRESTING, IT'S KRISTINA FRYE.
she KNEW THAT ROSEMARY WAS IN DANGER.
she KNEW WHERE TO FIND THE CAR, THE MURDER WEAPON,
which MEANS THAT SHE EITHER DOES HAVE SUPERNATURAL POWERS
or SHE WAS INVOLVED IN THE CRIME.
come ON. SHE SIMPLY DID WHAT YOU DO SO WELL.
with AN AIR OF CONFIDENCE, SHE MADE AN EDUCATED GUESS.
where ELSE WOULD YOU DUMP A CAR AROUND HERE?
she's A GOOD GUESSER.
well, I GUESS THAT'S A POSSIBILITY, TOO.
Yes, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU OBJECT TO, ISN'T IT?
not THAT SHE'S A CON ARTIST BUT THAT SHE'S SO GOOD AT IT.
maybe EVEN BETTER THAN YOU.
not AT ALL. I...
all RIGHT, YES.
not BETTER THAN ME, MIND YOU, BUT SHE IS GOOD,
and IT'S THE GOOD ONES THAT AREHE MOST DANGEROUS.
excuse ME, BUT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY
that SHE'S ACTUALLY HONESTLY IN TOUCH WITH SOMETHING BEYOND YOUR UNDERSTANDING.
that WOULD BE GOLF AND MUSICAL THEATER OF THE '30s AND '40s.
the CAR IS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR THESE IN THE TRUNK.
high-grade COATED NYLON.
just LIKE THEY USE IN A PHOTO LAB.
Jeremy's GONE.
we HAD AN EXCHANGE, AND I TOLD HIM NOT TO COME BACK
and SOME OF MOM'S JEWELRY IS MISSING. YOU REALLY THINK HE DID IT?
and SOMEONE STOLE YOUR MOM'S CAR AND USED IT TO KILL HER.
but THE LOCKS WEREN'T JIMMIED. THEY HAD A KEY.
and YOU THINK I DID IT. LOOK, I ALREADY TOLD YOU WHERE I WAS.
go OUT, TALK TO MY FRIENDS. WE DID. THEY SAID THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE PARTY THAT NIGHT. YOU COULD HAVE LT AND COME BACK.
this IS SO UNFAIR. HOW...
my BROTHER'S RIGHT. JEREMY JUST LEFT.
clearly HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.
stay HERE.
Rigsby, IT'S ME. I NEED AN A. P.B. ON JEREMY HALE.
check THE AIRPORTS.
he's PROBABLY GOT AT LEAST TWO HOURS ON US.
he HASN'T GONE THAT FAR. HE'S NOT ON A PLANE.
how DO YOU KNOW? HE LEFT TOO MUCH BEHIND.
in A ROOM FULL OF PHOTOGRAPHS, FIVE ARE OF ROSEMARY.
the REST ARE DATED AT LEAST A YEAR AGO.
except...
this ONE.
this WAS TAKEN A FEW WEEKS AGO. BRAND-NEW.
a LITTLE DAMAGED, BUT SOMEWHAT INTIMATE.
a WOMAN'S HEEL WOULD MAKE A HOLE LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T IT? YES.
being ROSEMARY'S HOUSE, WE CAN ASSUME IT'S ROSEMARY'S HEEL.
I'm STILL WITH YOU.
why WOULD ROSEMARY WANT TO PUT HER HEEL
in THIS NICE YOUNG WOMAN'S PICTURE,
that WAS TAKEN BY HER womanizing BOYFRIEND JEREMY?
know HER?
Yeah. THAT'S, UM, CONNIE ADAMS,
my MOM'S BRIDGE PARTNER'S DAUGHTER, CONNIE.
hello.
can I HELP YOU?
nice NECKLACE. POLICE.
we're LOOKING FOR JEREMY HALE. IS HE HERE?
baby?
Hi, JEREMY.
Hey.
let's GO TALK. YOU MIGHT WANT SOME CLOTHES.
or A LOT MORE WHIPPED CREAM. YOUR CALL.
rosemary WAS KILLED BY SOMEBODY DRIVING ONE OF HER OWN CARS.
okay.
a SILVER CHRYSLER. YOU EVER DRIVE THIS CAR, JEREMY?
no. THAT'S THE CAR THAT TRAVIS DROVE.
not MY STYLE. THING IS, WE FOUND A GLOVE IN THE CAR
that's FROM YOUR PHOTO LAB.
what ARE THE CHANCES WE FIND YOUR D. N.A. ON IT?
well, TRAVIS COULD HAVE TAKEN THOSE. TRAVIS HAS AN ALIBI.
you COULD HAVE TAKEN THE CAR IN ORDER TO THROW SUSPICION ON HIM.
I COULD HAVE, I SUPPOSE, BUT I DIDN'T. YOU LEFT THE TENNANT HOUSE FAST,
almost LIKE YOU WERE RUNNING AWAY.
why IS THAT? I GOT INTO IT WITH THE KIDS.
that CLARA IS INSANE. I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA ASSAULT ME.
they THINK YOU KILLED THEIR MOTHER. WELL, THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME.
I LOVED HER. OF COURSE YOU DID. THAT'S WHY YOU GAVE ROSEMARY'S NECKLACE TO YOUR HOT NEW GIRLFRIEND.
well, IT'S NO GOOD TO ROSEMARY, IS IT?
so SHOOT ME. I'M A PRAGMATIST.
that's A GOOD WORD.
Miami, NEW YORK, CHICAGO
all WIDOWS, AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS TO YOUR BUDDING CAREER.
and ALL ALIVE AND WELL AND STILL GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE,
if YOU CARE TO SPEAK TO ANY OF THEM.
well, PHOEBE MIGHT BE A LITTLE AMBIVALENT ABOUT ME,
but... THE OTHERS ARE, YOU KNOW...
do YOU KNOW KRISTINA FRYE?
uh... THAT NAME IS FAMILIAR, BUT NO.
I DON'T THINK SO. SHE'S ROSEMARY'S PSYCHIC,
and I THINK YOU HAVE MET KRISTINA.
you TO HER PHOTOGRAPH. JANE TELLS US ONE OF YOUR PORTRAITS IS HANGING IN HER FOYER. WELL, I-I TAKE A LOT OF PICTURES.
two BENEFICIARIES ON THE SAME WILL,
both INTIMATE FRIENDS OF ROSEMARY'S,
yet THE TWO OF YOU HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY MET.
what ARE THE CHANCES?
I WANT A LAWYER.
Hey, BOSS, CHECK THIS OUT.
info ON KRISTINA FRYE.
in THE LAST TEN YEARS, EACH OF THESE PEOPLE
left HER NAME IN THEIR WILLS,
paydays RANGING FROM $10, 000 TO $200, 000.
maybe THE PSYCHIC AND JEREMY HAD A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP
fleecing VULNERABLE WOMEN. SO MAYBE JANE WAS RIGHT.
it DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.
no, BUT IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START A CONVERSATION WITH FRYE.
Kristina, HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW JEREMY HALE?
he WAS ROSEMARY'S LOVER. UH, KIND OF A USER, I'D SAY,
but GENUINELY FOND OF HER, I THINK.
quite A GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER. HE TOOK MY PICTURE.
did YOU KNOW HE WAS ALSO NAMED IN THE VICTIM'S WILL? IF THAT WAS ROSEMARY'S DECISION, FINE.
but WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT? OVER THE LAST DECADE, FIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
have NAMED YOU IN THEIR WILLS. AGAINST MY EXPRESS WISHES.
I've HELPED HUNDREDS OF SICK CLIENTS
confront THEIR FEAR OF DYING,
and I ASSURE ALL OF THEM THAT I WILL TRY AND SPEAK TO THEM AFTER THEY'RE GONE,
but I HAVE NEVER ASKED ANY OF THEM FOR ANYTHING EVER.
then WHY DID JEREMY GET NERVOUS WHEN YOUR NAME WAS MENTIONED?
probably BECAUSE WE HAD SEX ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS.
we HAD FUN. HE'S A GOOD TIME.
have YOU SPOKEN TO ROSEMARY T? YES, I HAVE.
Oh, YOU DID? WHAT DID SHE SAY? SHE SEEMS QUITE KEN WITH YOU.
Ah. SHE SAID YOU WERE A GOOD MAN
a DEEPLY MISGUIDED AND DAMAGED MAN,
but GOOD.
well, THAT'S VERY FLATTERING.
did SHE HAPPEN TO MENTION WHO KILLED HER? NO. SHE DIDN'T KNOW.
but SHE WANTS ME TO KEEP TRYING TO HELP YOU AS MUCH AS I CAN.
well, NOT THAT YOU MENTION IT, I'D LOVE TO HEAR
your CD RECORDINGS OF YOUR SESSIONS TOGETHER. ABSOLUTELY.
and, UH, CAN YOU HAVE ROSEMARY APPEAR
at THE READING OF THE WILL? SHE'S A DEPARTED SOUL, NOT A WEDDING SINGER.
you CAN'T BOOK HER IN ADVANCE. AH, YEAH. I GUESS, UH, TIME DOESN'T MEAN MUCH
when YOU'RE DEAD FOREVER. NO SCHEDULE TO KEEP.
what's THE RUSH? RIGHT.
nice CRADLING.
you PLAY LACROSSE?
no.
fast-moving STICKS SCARE ME.
find OUT WHO DID IT YET?
not YET.
Hi.
Hi.
find ANYTHING?
I THINK KRISTINA FRYE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MOTHER'S DEATH.
to CONTACT YOUR MOM AT THE READING OF THE WILL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
how IS GETTING IN TOUCH WITH MY MOM
gonna HELP YOU THE KRISTINA? WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
she's NOT REALLY GONNA GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR MOM.
she's A FRAUD. I'M GOING TO EXPOSE HER. HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE WON'T REALLY PULL IT OFF?
well, SHE WON'T, BECAUSE SHE CAN'T.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
me NEITHER. WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE? IT'S IMMORAL.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
say YOUR BRAIN GETS COOKED IF YOU USE THEM A LOT.
make YOU INFERTILE, TOO.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
we WE LOOKING AT THE MICROWAVE.
uh, WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE DOING THAT RAISING DEAD PEOPLE. YOU SAY THAT, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW.
you're MOCKING THE OCCULT.
you DON'T HAVE ANY BELIEF IN THE AFTERLIFE.
you DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.
like KRISTINA USE TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE. BOO!
Yeah, LAUGH. GO AHEAD. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT KRISTINA'S A FAKE, ISN'T IT??
because IF SHE'S NOT-- IF SHE DOES HAVE A GIFT
everything YOU MOCK, EVERYTHING YOU DISCREDIT,
everything YOU STAND FOR GETS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.
um... YEAH. TRUE.
UNREALIY, BUT TRUE.
and WHAT IF YOUR FAMILY'S LOOKING DOWN AT YOU TONIGHT
but THEY CAN'T BECAUSE YOU WON'T BELIEVE?
well, THAT WOULD BE VERY SAD.
I'm SORRY.
no, THAT'S OKAY.
really, IT'S QUITE IRREGULAR.
it's WHAT MY MOTHER WANTED.
very W WELL.
if YOU CAN ALL PLEASE SIT DOWN?
at THE REQUEST OF ROSEMARY AND HEDAUGHTER CLARA,
the READING OF THE WILL SHALL BE PREFACED WITH A...
what DO YOU CALL IT?
good EVENING, EVERYBODY, AND WELCOME.
with YOUR HELP TONIGHT, I'M GONNA TRY AND CONTACT ROSEMARY.
will YOU ALL PLEASE HOLD HANDS WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR ON EITHER SIDE?
everybody?
good. THANK YOU.
thank YOU. WOULD YOU PLEASE TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN?
the VEIL WILL BE DRAWN BACK AND ROSEMARY WILL COME TO US,
as LONG AS WE BELIEVE.
as LONG AS WE BELIEVE.
everybody CONCENTRATE
on THE CANDLE IN THE CENTER OF THE TABLE.
look AT IT
and CONCENTRATE ON ROSEMARY.
come TO US, ROSEMARY.
come TO US.
speak.
it's ME, ROSEMARY.
I'm HERE, AS I PROMISED YOU I WOULD BE.
all YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE HERE, TOO, ROSEMARY.
is THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?
or ASK?
mom?
why, CLARA?
why DID YOU DO IT?
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
what DO YOU MEAN?
this IS ALL A SCHEME THAT YOU AND KRISTINA COOKED UP, ISN'T IT?
well, IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE, BUT I'M NOT BUYING IT.
I'm NOT GONNA BUY IT. I'M NOT BUYING IT. I CAN'T.
I CAN'T.
no.
no, I...
it's... I'M...
next CUE'S UP. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
got IT.
why, CLARA, WHY?
who's DOING THIS?
I'm SORRY, MOM.
I'm SO SORRY.
was IT YOU, CLARA?
were YOU IN THE CAR?
is THAT WHY SHE'S HERE?
is THAT WHAT'S CAUSED ALL THIS?
Yes.
Yes.
I GOT MAD.
I JUST GOT MAD.
Why?
she TOLD ME...
that SHE WAS GONNA CHANGE THE WILL AGAIN
to DISINHERIT TRAVIS.
she SAID THAT IT WAS FOR HIS OWN GOOD.
and SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME.
we SAID SOME HARSH THINGS TO EACH OTHER.
so I RODE THE TRAIN DOWN FROM CLEAR LAKE
to SPEAK TO HER IN PERSON,
make HER...
see THINGS RATIONALLY.
I KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO SEE HER DAMN PSYCHIC.
and...
I DIDN'T WANT TO RUN INTO THAT CREEP JEREMY,
so I WENT TO THE HOUSE
to GO PICK UP ONE OF THE CARS TO MEET HER.
I SAW HER AFTER SHE LEFT KRISTINA'S,
and I CALLED HER
so THAT SHE WOULDN'T BE FREAKED OUT
that I WOULD TURN UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
and SHE DIDN'T PICK UP THE PHONE
for HER OWN DAUGHTER, AND...
I JUST GOT MAD.
thank YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY, CLARA.
how DID YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS ME?
uh, WELL, UH...
it DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME UNTIL LATER
when YOU STARTED TRYING TO PIN THE BLAME ON JEREMY.
but WHEN YOU FIRST CAME IN HERE, YOU EXPRESSED GREAT HORROR
that YOUR MOTHER HAD DIED IN THE GUTTER
not IN THE ROAD, NOT IN THE SIDEWALK, BUT THE GUTTER.
for HER TO DIE IN THE GUTTER LIKE THAT, IT'S...
like GARBAGE, IT'S--IT'S HORRIBLE.
and HOW COULD YOU HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE DIED IN THE GUTTER
unless... YOU'D BEEN THERE?
I DID IT FOR TRAVIS.
and FOR YOURSELF.
she SAID THAT SHE WOULD PROTECT US!
she PROMISED MY DAD THAT SHE WOULD.
parents ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THEIR KIDS.
Yes, THEY ARE.
can I SEE MY BROTHER NOW?
sure.
I KNOW YOU WEREN'T THINKING RIGHT...
when YOU DID WHAT YOU DID.
be GOOD TO AUNT JO,
and DON'T--DON'T LEAVE YOUR CLOTHES EVERYWHERE,
and... BE RESPECTFUL, OKAY?
I WILL.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
thank YOU FOR LETTING ME TALK TO HER.
you BET.
you SLEEP HERE?
Yes, SOMETIMES.
uh, THE NOISE RELAXES ME, YOU KNOW.
it's LIKE THE SEA.
can I HELP YOU?
Yeah, I JUST CAME TO PICK UP MY RECORDINGS. HELP YOURSELF.
Thanks.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
fire AWAY. IN PRIVATE.
this IS PRIVATE.
more PRIVATE.
okay.
so...
promise ME YOU WON'T INTERRUPT. HEAR ME OUT.
okay, I PROMISE.
I TALKED TO YOUR WIFE. OH, HANG ON, THIS IS
no, NUH-UH.
ever SINCE YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED,
there's A QUESTION ABOUT THAT NIGHT'S EVENTS
that's BEEN TORMENTING YOU, YES?
yes?
Yes.
your WIFE WANTS ME TO TELL YOU
that YOUR DAUGHTER NEVER WOKE UP.
she DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
she WASN'T SCARED, NOT EVEN FOR A SECOND.
you're DONE CHANNELING? THAT'S IT?
that's IT.
Thanks.
good-bye, MR. JANE.
mentalist /'men-t3-list/ noun
someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.
Davis Motor...
thank god. You're here.
there was screaming and gunshots upstairs in room 222.
the one-- the one on the right. Right there.
police! Open the door.
come on, open up!
we have a young female-- Patrice Magan and Joseph Purcell,
who was gonna be the star witness in California vs. Carris,
which was one of the attorney general's favorite upcoming narcotics cases.
state's witness, and no police protection?
Davis P. D. had it covered-- that is, until Purcell went A. W. O. L. a few weeks ago.
didn't want to testify, I guess.
with Purcell dead, the case against Carris dies, too.
he walks.
so obviously, guys, for all of our sakes, this is a must-close.
Davis P. D. is still running the Carris case, by the way, so we have to work with them.
don't freeze 'em out.
who is Carris, and where is he or she right now?
Rick Carris is the man to know in the Davis Meth business.
he was busted a month ago after a big, expensive operation.
he's out and about on a $2 million bond.
Purcell here is one of his top street captains.
look at that.
this fool is state's witness against the biggest cocaine dealer in the county,
and he's dealing the same drug out of his own motel room
like Carris wouldn't hear about that. He must have had a death wish.
it's not cocaine.
it's powdered milk.
Yes, that's often used to cut the product.
what are you looking for?
the girl had her keys in her hand.
she was only planning on stopping by.
Oh, no.
hello.
baby, hello.
so what happens to her?
social services have foster homes that specialize in babies.
they'll take care of her until we can find Patrice's family.
if she has a family.
social services. This is Kaylee?
Bye.
Lisbon, Jane, Van Pelt, detectives Blakely and Preciado, Davis Homicide.
they will be your liaisons with Davis P. D.
I speak for myself and your chief when I urge you all to work harmoniously.
keep me posted.
so your name's Blakely?
the first responder was a Blakely.
that was my son.
poor kid--first time rolling up on a body.
puked his guts up later. - He'll be okay.
listen, uh, just so we're clear, now you can call us "liaisons."
if you like, but this is still a Davis P. D. Case.
our narcotics unit's been trying to bust Rick Carris for years.
we appreciate your position.
have you checked the liquor store over there for surveillance cameras?
not yet. - I'll get on it.
I got a dumb question. How come you guys let Joe Purcell slip away?
stuff happens, right? - Yeah. Stuff happens.
Yeah. When we bring in Rick Carris, we'll give you a call.
you're confident it was Carris who did this?
Purcell seems like the type of man who had quite a few enemies.
Yeah, we're confident.
what if Purcell wasn't the target? What if the girl was the target?
what makes you think that?
what makes you think she wasn't?
either way, she's the place top start with the investigation.
she was only here for a moment, so the shooter came in as soon as she arrived,
which suggests that he or they followed her here.
so we'll retrace her steps.
what's Patrice Matigan's current address?
we don't know.
we checked the address on her license and registration, but she hasn't lived here for several months.
you're making this more difficult than it needs to be. We knew who did it.
this was a hit ordered by Rick Carris.
if he's in town, we'll round him up.
you guys relax, see the sights.
when are you gonna learn to cool it without being told?
Oh, come on. They pissed you off, too, the sexist pigs.
they were.
I just said they were.
you were saying it ironically. - Here.
there was a couple of issues of that in her car.
fifty fresh and floral ideas for a spring wedding?
mailing address.
Lacey Wells. 65758 Rancho Highway.
let's go.
Lacey Wells?
you the cops?
Yeah, CBI.
what's the problem?
do you know Patrice Matigan?
she lives here. What about her? And where is she?
she was murdered early this morning.
Oh, my god.
how long have you known Patrice?
couple of years, like that.
and she's lived here with you for how long?
since Joe got busted.
two, three months.
she couldn't stay with him, the way he lives.
that son of a bitch! Now I knew he'd get her into trouble.
can you think of anybody who would have wanted to kill him?
aside from Rick Carris and any of his crew?
sure, lots of people.
can you tell us what happened last night?
Joe called her really late.
he's mad hungry, but he's paranoid.
won't leave his room.
thinks Rick Carris' boys are everywhere.
begs her to bring him some food, which she does like a fool.
and that's...
that's the last I saw of her and Kaylee.
why would she take Kaylee out with her in the middle of the night?
couldn't you have babysat for her?
I had been drinking.
and she didn't want to leave Kaylee with me.
she had her flaws, but she was a good mom.
I mean, that kid is always clean and--and dry, and she's smiling.
look at how she keeps this place. - Yeah. It's nice.
how does she pay the rent?
Oh, she always has money when she needs it.
you know, she and me got busted this last Christmas, and she came up with, like, 10 grand to front the bail and even more for the lawyer.
I mean, we were busted with a whole ounce of Meth, and she made that crap disappear.
she was into Meth? - No.
no. No, it was my drugs.
but it was in her car, so you know...
did you ask her how she got the money to pay for the lawyer?
she wasn't the hooker type, so I just figured she had a rich boyfriend hidden somewhere.
you know, a couple of times, a dude would come by and not come in.
you know, she'd go for a ride, and then she had cash when she came back.
what did he look like?
he's, um, like a skinny, tough guy, dark hair and drove a blue car.
excuse me.
it always goes off.
just got a call from Sacramento Homicide.
snitch gave 'em a location on Rick Carris.
he's in Boonville, halfway between here and Davis.
get an entry team. We're on our way.
should I tell Blakely and Preciado?
of course. Davis P. D. are our partners in this.
hold off on going in until I get there.
thank you, Lacey.
Yeah, hey, uh, listen, social services
they're--they're not gonna bring Kaylee back here, are they?
no.
I--I love her and all, but I'm not-- I--I couldn't...
don't worry. They're not gonna bring her back here, okay?
she's goes somewhere okay, though, right?
I mean, they'll-- they'll take care of her good?
Yes. They try.
she's a good kid, so...
where you going?
to make the bust. What do you think? Cover the back.
wait. - What?
Oh, you guys wanna help or you gonna stand there and pick your nose?
come on, guys. Play nice this is a joint operation.
we go in together when our boss and the entry team get here.
this is our arrest, always has been, and we got no time to wait for your mommy.
Hey, there's always time, all right? Let 's do this right.
go in too quickly, and someone will get hurt.
this is real police work, sonny. People get hurt.
go push some paper.
real police work? You mean like protecting a state's witness?
walk away. Walk away.
look at me. All right? We told 'em not to go in.
if this goes south now, it's their necks.
we don't want to be involved in any way. Be smart. Let it go.
what's going on? What are they doing?
Blakely and Preciado wouldn't wait for the entry team.
tried to talk to them. They wouldn't listen. They're out for blood.
get on your knees right now.
let's see your hands.
that's our bust. Hand him over.
the hell we will. Walk away.
okay, calm down.
Yes, we get it.
you're very calm and in control, Rick...
for a man being questioned in a double murder investigation.
I didn't do this thing.
although, I've been sat in this frickin' chair so many times, this is kind of restful.
that's right, isn't it? Many times.
assault...POSSESSION, INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE.
this fricking case coming up--that's three now for you.
that's a long time.
all on the testimony of Joe Purcell.
look, it's no secret Joe Purcell's death was a huge boom for me, man.
come on, it was huge.
and I gotta confess, I was...
really starting to feel that life sentence breathe down my neck, but you know what?
I got fierce angels on my shoulders.
are you a man of your word, Rick?
I am.
you do what you say you'll do?
look, I know where this is going.
this is from Purcell's answering machine.
Hey, Joe. You're a dead man. Dead.
I'm gonna do you my own self.
I'm gonna look you in the eye and cut your heart out and shove it down your throat, you mo
that is you, isn't it?
hyperbole is lost on some people.
we think you kept your word, Rick. You found Patrice.
you followed her to Joe Purcell hiding at the motel.
you killed him and that young girl just to stay out of prison, just like you said you would.
no, I said I was gonna cut his heart out and feed it to him.
no, if I had found him, I'd have kept my word.
believe me, and I was looking for him.
that's how you know it wasn't me, man.
all right, maybe I wouldn't have cut his heart out or nothing, but I definitely would have cut him.
where were you last night?
a bar I own, Del's Tavern. - Until when?
I don't know. 11: 30, maybe.
anyone with you?
Oh, yeah. Sasha.
Sasha. Sasha have a second name?
Sasha the cocktail waitress.
one young lady in your employ. That's not much of an alibi.
it's not much of a case, man.
you got no murder weapon and you got no witnesses.
so you can kiss my ass, unless you want to get a sun lamp in here and a couple of beers.
I'll be happy to kick back and listen to you guys waste your frickin' time.
I guess I'll just hand you over to the Davis P. D.
they're very anxious to talk to you.
all right. Whatever. Look, i want to talk to my lawyer now, please.
okay. So we're done here.
food's here.
Hawaiian? - Yeah.
Cho hates pineapple.
well, he can take it off, can't he?
Yeah, I guess.
I don't complain when he and Rigsby order Mexican.
what is it you don't like about Mexican?
cilantro. I can't stand it.
but I don't make a fuss.
Oh, you don't, do you? Why is that?
sometimes you have to go along to get along.
I know you know how.
gee, thanks.
it's all about the balance, Grace.
Yin--yang. Nice--bitch.
Yes, I'll work on that.
keep 'em guessing.
there's pineapple on it.
you can take it off.
I'll know it's been there.
so Carris was at Del's Tavern.
Sasha the cocktail waitress says she was with him at his residence at 12: 45 a. m.
when the motel shootings took place.
she's confident about the time frame because they were having sex with the TV on.
and it was the Scottish guy talking to that actress who married the country singer.
Carris would have got someone else to do the dirty work for him anyway.
he was only boasting when he said about how he's gonna rip out Purcell's heart himself.
he's a drug dealer, not an Aztec.
that's good. Not an Aztec.
you're right. Carris isn't responsible for these murders.
why not?
he told you himself-- it's not his style.
he wouldn't have had the patience to watch and follow Patrice until she led him to Purcell.
and if he had found her, he would have just jumped right in and hurt her until she gave Purcell up.
just for the sake of argument, let's assume you're right.
Yes, I'm saying that maybe Patrice Matigan was the target.
that's the second time you said that.
well, Patrice-- she was an attractive young woman,
but didn't work and had a regular supply of money from somewhere...
boyfriend.
and was able to make a very serious drug charge disappear.
cop boyfriend.
skinny cop boyfriend with dark hair that drives a blue car, if you listen to Lacey Wells.
detective Preciado is skinny with dark hair.
he had crossed my mind.
and a hot-tempered man, as we now know, who probably carries what, a .38?
Yeah. Yeah, I think he does.
Joe and Patrice were shot with a .38 .
Yes, they were. - Slow down. What's his motive?
well, it's a simple crime of passion, isn't It?
he comes upon the woman he loves with another man. Kills them both.
Oh, damn.
he couldn't have been that surprised.
she had Joe Purcell's baby.
how is she? The baby.
uh, fine, I guess. I mean, she's a baby.
keep 'em warm and fed, they're happy.
let's go have a chat with Preciado.
we're already in hot water with the Davis P. D.
we need to be sure we're right, find out the facts and then act.
Yes, boss.
let's see if Patrice really did dodge a possession charge at Christmas
and let's make sure the story about the accidentoney is bos.
then we'll go to the friend, Lacey, and we'll show her pictures.
if she identifies Preciado as the man she saw,
and if Preciado drives a blue car and if he carries a .38,
we'll go, and we'll talk to him.
Preciado owns a blue car.
can I have your salad? Thanks.
Oh, Gladys Knight and the Pips.
you brought our prisoner back?
detective Preciado, we need to sit down with you for a while.
we have a few questions for you.
what questions?
that's a . 38 you carry, isn't it?
you trying to say it was me?
you miserable sons of bitches. Where the hell do you get the nerve
hold on, Steve. Cool it. Let me handle this.
no. No, this one's mine.
where the hell do you get the nerve to come up here in my town, talking to me like that?
what weapon do I carry?
the California State Constitution.
we've come to you out here out of respect.
we could have found you in the police station and made a fuss.
you should be glad you didn't. - No, you should be glad we didn't.
you have nothing on me.
we can put you with Patrice.
her roommate, Lacey Wells, identified you from a photo.
come have a quiet talk with us, clear up a couple of things, no big deal.
what couple of things?
this doesn't concern you, detective.
excuse me. He's my partner.
leave it alone, Dale. Just leave it. I can handle this.
let's go.
Good--good to meet you again.
what's the matter with him?
how well did you know Patrice Matigan?
let's not screw around here.
just tell me what you have, cop to cop.
cop to cop?
we know you were giving her money.
we know she got off of a meth bust last Christmas.
evidence was lost, right? From the davis p. D. Lockup?
happens.
we figure you took it.
that's what you figure.
Yes, and we could dig in and prove it, but I don't want to spend any time doing that.
I'd rather just talk straight with you, avoid dragging other good cops into this mess, right?
go on.
we figure you and Patrice were having a sexual relationship.
she was...She was a confidential informant.
we considered that, but then she'd be on file, right?
and you could have put in for the money as a C. I. expense,
but you didn't do that, did you? Why?
my guess-- because you're honest man.
Yeah. Sure.
okay. I was banging her. So what?
did you know she was also in a relationship with your missing witness?
we had a business relationship. I paid her for sex.
I didn't know or care what she did when I wasn't there.
you paid her a lot of money. A lot.
good-looking man like you, there had to have been more to it than that.
did she have something on you?
well, she was punctual and clean and didn't say much. I like that in a woman.
did you know your man Joe Purcell was the father of her child?
no.
a lowlife junkie dealer with your woman-- How'd that make you feel?
couldn't care less.
do you, uh, want the rest of my sandwich?
I can't finish it. - What?
good sandwich.
what is wrong with him?
where were you at 12: 45 Monday morning?
I was at my partner's.
we watched the game.
I was too drunk torive, so I slept on the couch.
at blakely's? Just you and him?
and his wife.
do you have your weapon on you?
Yes, I do.
mind if we borrow it for a while, have ballistics take a look at it?
look, I don't want to have to make this official, talk to a judge or anything.
once we do that, the cat's out of the bag for good.
if you're clean on this, here's the way to prove it.
is this the only . 38 in your possession?
Yes, it is.
and if you try to hold my hand again, I'm Gonna tear your arm off and beat you unconscious with it.
get me? - Gotcha.
well?
you know, it's just funny what bad liars cops are.
I guess they're not used to coealing themselves under questioning.
I'm a cop, and I lie to you all the time. You never catch it.
well, sorry to burst your bubble, but you're translucent, my dear.
I always know when you're lying.
somemes I let you think you fooled me just so you don't feel bad.
name one time.
last thanksgiving you said you were going back east to your brother's house,
but I knew you were actually planning on having three days at home alone to watch old movies and eat ice cream.
okay, so that's one time.
what about Preciado?
his stress pulse rate was thready, dishonest.
Thready?
hard to describe pulses.
uh, a dishonest pulse feels different to an Indignant pulse.
in this case, hard to say what he's lying about exactly,
but he was signaling deception from first to last.
there's something off about his whole story. Where are we going?
to the zoo. They have new tiger cubs.
liar.
Oh, very good. I'm gonna go and speak with blakely.
blakely's not gonna tell you anything.
Nah, blakely's old-school.
he'll back his partner to the moon, but his wife might be less steadfast.
I'll keep the husband in the office while you go and talk to the wife.
sweet.
what is it?
Yeah, uh, what is it?
I'd like to speak with katherine blakely.
Sam? Officer sam blakely?
Yeah. Uh, now isn't very convenient.
uh, if you want to speak with her, you should call and arrange something.
Yes, I was just passing by.
that's a shame, sam. I really did need to speak to her.
who is it, sam?
CBI, ma'am. Murder investigation.
murder investigation? - The Purcell-Matigan killings?
the couple I found.
Oh, my lord. Yes. Terrible thing.
that poor little baby.
well, I'll--I'll leave you to it then.
no, ma'am. It's... You that I wish to speak with.
I am so proud of my two policemen.
there are three generations of davis law enforcement in this family. Three.
when people see the blakely name in Davis, they know that it stands for something.
Cripe sakes, ma. It's enough.
Oh, he hates me bragging on him.
so tell me, why on earth do you want to ask me about these killings?
officer blakely, could we have a moment alone, please?
it's okay.
it's kind of confidential stuff, ma'am.
well, go on, sam.
I don't think I should, mom.
dad wouldn't like it.
well, you're not your dad. Just give us a moment.
go on.
Sam was so upset that night.
it was his first time coming up on a killing. Poor thing.
I remember the first time dale caught a bad Call.
we were newlyweds, and he came home and he actually cried.
tried hide it.
but I told him and I told sam that there is no shame in feeling sad.
there isn't.
you've experienced the same thing, no doubt.
death is part of the job.
Yes. Yes, is.
sorry. Rambling.
what did you wanna talk to me about, mr. Jane?
am, your husband's partner, detective Preciado, is a person of interest in the Case.
Steve? No.
he said that he was here at your House, sleeping on your couch, at the time of The murders.
that was 12: 45 a. m. Monday morning. Was he here?
Yes. Yes, he was. He--he stayed the night.
why would you be interested in steve? He's such a straight arrow.
he said that he was having an affair with Patrice matigan.
steve preciado? - Yes.
why not?
uh, I don't know. It--it--it just doesn't seem likely.
Katherine, you're hiding something.
this is a ate investigation.
you're obligated to tell me the truth.
well, you have to promise that you will not say it was me who spoke of it.
I won't tell a soul.
well, Dale says that Steve has a problem, you Know...
down there?
down there.
there's pills for that now.
Yes. No. He's a hopeless case, apparently.
well, that's strange.
that's very strange,'cause he's the one that told us he was having an affair with Patrice.
Oh, well, knowing steve, I'm sure he was lying to protect his machismo
or protecting someone else.
I-I'm so sorry. How stupid of me.
what happened? - Nothing.
it--it's just a little accident.
what did you say to her, huh? What do you--what have you done?
he's done nothing. Your father...
my father? What? What did you tell her?
you knew. You knew that's who she was.
that's why the two of you have been whispering in corners and acting so strange.
no, ma. You got it all wrong.
you don't understand.
dad wasn't having an affair.
dad, mom thinks that-- - what, Sam? What do I think?
you swore on his life.
you swore on your son's life you would never betray me again!
come inside, hon. I'm gonna tell you the truth, just not out here.
Oh, no. Not out here. You're Dale blakely. You're one of the good guys.
get in the house now! - Detective Blakely...
shut your mouth. - You okay?
assault. Assault.
I would rethink this new technique of yours.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't disagree.
now we're arresting them. Hooray.
we have the right. He assaulted Jane, and he looks good for the Murders.
before you charge a cop with murder, you better look better than good.
you better look like the Damn Mona lisa.
Yes, I hear
because if you're wrong, we will have no murder suspect,
the attorney general will have no narcotics case against carris,
and we will have wrongly arrested a distinguished veteran officer in his home jurisdiction.
Yes, boss.
what was the nature of your relationship with Patrice Matigan?
I was helping her out.
helping her with close to 1000 bucks a month. That's a lot of help.
what did she give you in return? - Nothing.
okay. What story did y tell your wife about the money?
I... Got nothing left to say.
how were you making ends meet?
did you maybe take a little drug money again and again?
I never took a penny. Not a damn penny.
so I guess if Patrice started asking you for more money, you'd have been hard - pressed, right?
get me a lawyer.
I'll set that up for you.
Where's your service revolver?
agent Rigsby tells me you didn't have it with you.
it was stolen. - Yeah?
Yeah, from my car. - Okay. It's no problem. It happens.
a . 38, was it? - That's right.
I'll get you that lawyer.
he's not gonna talk.
poor soul.
he made his bed. He can lie in it.
you know,I never really understood that one.
just 'cause someone makes their bed, why do They have to lie in it?
what's to stop them from lying in another bed or on the floor, for that matter?
Sam blakely's here.
I'm on it.
officer blakely, thanks for coming.
I got no choice. You have my father locked up.
is your mother okay?
don't worry about my mother. My father is innocent.
we know that. - You people are making a big--what?
we know your father didn't do it.
this is from the security cameras in the Liquor store in front of the motel.
we finally got to look at it today.
this is at 12: 40 a. M.
that's Patrice Matigan's car arriving.
and that is Rick Rarris' man.
we misjudged carris.
he found Patrice, had a man follow her.
you can see his license plate right there. Can you make that bigger?
Yes, we can.
we know who it is.
a thug that works for rick carris named q - Tip.
but get this. Carris says q-tip didn't kill him.
q-tip went to kill joe, but he got there too late.
someone else got to him first.
well, that's gotta be a bunch of bull.
Carris says his man q-tip actually saw the real killer, saw the whole thing.
so Carris is offering us a deal.
if we let him out, his man q-tip will tell us exactly what he saw, D. The real killer.
and you believe him?
of course not. It's a transparent con.
q-tip killed him all right.
Carris is just trying to save his skin by laying the blame elsewhere.
on your father probably.
he must have known about his connection to Patrice.
so we're gonna play along, let the shooter come to us.
Carris has set up a meeting with q-tip tonight.
so we'll grab up q-tip and work him until we get the real story.
so, uh, what do you need me for exactly?
if this is gonna work, I can't have a whole bunch of angry Davis P. D.
swarming all over carris and his crew.
and the CBI is kind of unpopular with you guys right now.
Yes, you are. - So...
we were hoping you'd have a quiet word with your chief, let him know what we're up to.
well, knowing the chief, he's gonna want to know the details, um,
when and where you're gonna be meeting this Q-tip and what personnel you got operating undercover.
sure. But this needs to stay close between you and the chief.
we don't want to spook Carris.
he thinks he's playing us for a bunch of idiots.
I understand.
okay, team. Let the games begin.
Carris is on his way. He's gonna make the call when he makes the meet with q-tip.
be ready to act fast. Clear?
got it.
okay.
Roger that.
the warehouse is on fifth and geary. Loading dock in the back.
Q-tip's in the same car he was on the tape.
california plate 5-nora-tom-queen-9-5-7.
be there in ten minutes.
ten minutes? I can't get to fifth and geary in ten minutes.
well, do your best.
on our way. E. T. A. To Geary and fifth-- 12 minutes.
damn it. He won't wait that long.
officer blakely, are you closer to fifth and Geary?
officer blakely? Sam?
blakely, drop the gun! - Drop it!
Carris never made a deal, did he?
no. We, uh, edited the surveillance footage.
q-tip was just some guy that happened to walk up to the motel at some point, and, uh, Van Pelt
she laid in the license plate with, uh, photoshop.
that's clever. Kudos to you guys.
we know you're a decent man, sam.
we know you didn't mean for things to go down like this.
just tell us what happened.
I got nothing to say.
there's no use in hiding anything now.
there's no use in explaining either.
take a seat, detective. - Thank you.
son. - Dad.
well, there's--there's always a reckoning. This is it. Just...
just tell them the truth.
the truth, huh?
tell the truth no matter what.
that's the mark of a man, right, dad?
tell the truth. A man has his honor and his word, and that's It.
don't go over the same ground for god sake.
just give 'em the facts. - You want the facts? Okay.
mom suspected that dad was having an affair.
Well,Iasked around on the street.
pretty soon I hear that he's keeping this girl, Patrice Matigan, on the side.
I was mad as hell.
you gotta understand. This integrity crap was banged into me my entire life. Right, dad?
honesty, honor, family-- banged into me, and then all this time, he's keeping a whole on the side?
no. Never.
I went and I asked him if it was true, and he said no.
I knew he was lying to me. I knew it.
so Sunday night I...
went back to find the truth.
I thought, for sure, she was gonna meet dad.
and she went to the store, went to a motel.
I thought,"aha, I got him now.
Purcell must have thought I'd been sent by Carris to kill him.
I had no choice.
I panicked. I drove away.
and dispatch called, sent me right back to the motel.
I was the closest unit. What was I gonna do? Refuse the call?
I had to take it.
there's always a reckoning.
Patrice wasn't your mistress, was she?
no.
she was my daughter, sam's sister.
how did you know?
Sam told his mother you weren't cheating on her.
I believed him.
but then who was Patrice?
who was she to you?
and why all the secrecy?
I just figured she had to have been your daughter.
I never knew patrice existed until four years ago.
her mother was dying. So...
she got in touch,
told me I had a 16-year-old child I never knew about.
blew my mind. Just...
Oh, blew my mind.
you know, I wanted to tell katherine the truth, but...
y-you know, i...
Oh, my god.
I couldn't do it.
I just couldn't hurt her like that.
does she know now? - Yeah, she knows.
she knows.
sorry. Busy right now.
Katherine, it's Patrick Jane.
can you open the door?
I can't.
you can and you will.
I have something I need to give you.
this is kaylee, your granddaughter, kind of. Here.
she's very fond of cheerios.
that's, uh, that has nothing to do with me.
and she likes to take her big nap at 2: 00.
But--what? - You're all she has.
social services will be along later to get the paperwork signed.
the name kaylee doesn't really suit her, if you ask me.
if you want to change it, I'm sure no one will make a fuss.
you might need those. Bye.
you sick, soldier?
well, colonel, I have a little cold.
you have a little cold.
correct answer's "no, sir" or "yes, sir.
you feel like standing up?
what you're looking at, sergeant major, is what in the real brownshoes army used to be known as an ass-chewing.
might I be permitted to ask this general title, sir?
this general title is I see your men here reading and coughing and doing everything under god's blue sky except for studying the sere manual.
well, colonel...
why is it i don't see you studying the sereanual?
brown? Last time you did sere school?
about a year ago.
you find the tactics changed at sere?
Yes, sir. They were harsher.
had about a 20% dropout/failure rate.
these men need to be prepared for being captured in enemy territory.
you will, as their captors, attempt to get them to confess that they betrayed our country, been traitors to the U.S. Of A.
you will deprive them of sleep.
you will make fun of their genitalia.
we can do that, sir.
but you will not touch their genitalia.
you heard the man. Mack: Heavens, no.
you think sere school's a drill?
all: We are the drill bit.
that's right. It ain't no drill.
and should these soldiers break in sere, what's in their christmas stocking?
demotion to civilian.
something like that.
any of you thinking about being lenient, who are you gonna save that for?
our pets and babies, colonel.
most assuredly.
you're acting as guards.
you got to put these fellas through the wringer, bring back the news who's gonna break and who's gonna stand.
Mr. Williams. Sir?
you in the habit of imitating your betters?
only those, sir, i admire unreservedly.
you sick, soldier?
well, colonel, I have a little cold.
you ought to get that looked at.
you're dating someone named Puffy?
not anymore, apparently.
uh, I have an announcement.
um... it's a boy.
Congratulations.
you guys drop the bomb it's a boy in a unit that doesn't ever have boys.
Yeah, what's that about?
natural selection?
well, us men have a different theory.
Yes, and it isn't appropriate to be shared in mixed company.
let me guess.
has to do with the famed sexual prowess of special forces soldiers.
you said it, not me.
you excited?
are you kidding? Over the moon.
well, i'd be happy to hold the christening party at my house.
Thanks, but we're not.
did you christen Serena?
Yes. But not this one.
not this time.
you didn't say I shouldn't tell anyone.
everyone has expectations of what I should do.
of what we should do.
a christening.
no.
we planned a christening for the other one.
and we canceled it.
I'm not going through that again.
baby, Serena was fine.
okay? This one will be fine too.
have faith... you have faith.
I still have fear.
Mm-hmm.
you still going to this thing?
Mm-hmm.
how sick are you?
not bad.
you can opt out.
I'm good for guard duty.
I've been on one or two of these where things got a little too real for the guards.
keep control and remember it's just a drill.
last chance.
okay, then.
here we go.
cakewalk.
you think?
guys.
are you kidding me?
this is an U. S. Army sere training drill.
survival, evasion, resistance, escape.
you will relinquish all weapons to your captors now.

you do not look at our flag while our anthem plays.
drop and do push-ups till I get tired.
this man is a p. o.w.
like you, he's failed in his mission.
this man is a little better than vermin.
we do not coddle vermin.
we step on it.
this man is a sellout.
get the hell up.
fast start.
what's the point of a slow one?
I came here to make changes.
form up.
guards, receive the prisoners.
all prisoners strip now.

I know I need a long vacation go ahead and split 'em up.
I'd say let 'em rip. We got three days.
this isn't your old-school military where we keep troop positions secret for 24 hours.
our world takes hostages solely for propaganda value.
international law does not apply.
there are no nice guys.
if we don't train our men for that, we're preparing them to fail.
your boy's ill? Yes, ma'am.
men get sick.
whole point of torture, break 'em down, split 'em apart.
they're ill, we're one step ahead in the game.

your coughing's a tell.
gonna put us all in danger.
any extra water, give it to Brown.
keep his throat wet.
we find a way to escape.
absent that, we hang tough for three days.
keep each other strong. Get back to our jobs.
I ain't letting one of you get kicked out of the unit over some drill.
I'm pulling Brown.
absolutely not.
they break here, they're out.
they break in Iraq, Afghanistan, they're traitors and they're dead.
now, what do you want to do with Glen Campbell?
huddle up, protect Brown.
grey must be heading up the health committee.
I don't see him handing out any bandages.
you didn't hear Jonas handing out assignments, but he did.
nobody in your precious D. O.D. Warned you not to underestimate this group?
we got to conserve body heat.
fall in. We're gonna huddle.
think warm thoughts.
keep your body on Brown.
no matter what, keep faith with your mates.
get some rest. I'm not tired.
you will be, and you're our leader, so get some rest now.
like I said, health committee.
this'll be over soon enough.
don't bet on it.
ahh, romance, music, moonlight.
now, you can't beat that.
courtesy of my friends in nam.
your friends use anything other than noise to get results.
play it long enough, it'll cut to the gut.
maybe that's why the vietnam war lasted for so damn long.
in my experience, you want to be the new head of sere, you've got to learn the new way.
Serena, I found it.
you left it underneath my dollies, and God bless daddy so he doesn't get hurt.
honey?
what you doing?
praying for daddy.
we Lissy and Jen do it.
come here, baby doll.
you learn about praying last night at Lissy and Jen's?
jen says if she prays, her daddy will be safe, but if she doesn't...
Serena, daddy's always safe in our hearts.
we don't have to get on our knees.
we just have to love him.
do you love him?
No!
you do not miss a stone!
your mama told you you were stupid, didn't she.
you will pick up every stone here's our weak link.
that's a poor excuse of a man.
pull him.
take me!
he's sick.
I seen your file, soldier.
you have no brothers.
your father had no brothers.
your mother had no brothers.
your wife has no brothers.
but your wife is carrying a son.
who's the father?
what color will your son be?
will they call the boy "boy"?
"little Charles"? "Little Hector"? Or "Jonas' son"?
or "your son," soldier, just to be kind?
enough of the pleasantries.
let's see what he's made of.
start on the kidneys.
this ain't no drill. Not anymore.
you thirsty?
my name is Williams, Hector.
I am a Sergeant in the United States Army.
cause the water here is yours, you tell me whether or not it's true you were not part of recent clandestine operations in Afghanistan.
if you are able to confirm your absence from that mission, son, you'll be excused, go on home.
your friend took a bad beating.
he's awful sick.
you want to visit him? Take him some medicine?
fine. Let him get sicker.
no?
show him the monitor.
your mate isn't looking too good.
you can stop this.
I am a Master Sergeant in the United States Army.
beat on the kidneys.

what the hell were you thinking, jumping the guard again?
prisoners are not to harass or interfere with the administration of the camp.
unless it serves a greater objective.
resistance.
how's getting yourself beaten to a pulp with a flashlight manage that?
the light at the end of the tunnel, huh?
come with me.
I understand you requested medical attention for one of the men.
you are the senior officer?
my name is Blane, Jonas.
sergeant major. U. S. Army.
you know, I've studied 150 men in your unit.
black, White, Asian, hispanic, rich, poor, city kids, country bumpkins.
finally found the one thing connecting you all.
you know what that thing is, Sergeant?
my name is Blane, Jonas.
sergeant major. United States Army.
you're all children of adversity.
poverty, lack of love, drunken mothers, abusive fathers.
you all found your way here, didn't you.
question I have for the man, though, is what secret is the boy in you holding onto?
you must be hoping for a speedy return to your lovely wife and, what, your whore on the side?
feeding your lust with a cheap little piece?
aren't you ashamed?
your own daughter.
Betsy Blane, 19 years old.
according to her gynecologist, sexually active since age 14.
think it was a ploy for attention given your many absences?
price you pay. Price your child pays.
course as a physician I worry,
how about it?
was Betsy daddy's little girl?
who touched you as a kid?
made you want to touch your own daughter.
sorry, my mind was elsewhere.
your sister was uncle's little girl, wasn't she?
you didn't tell, now, did you?
my name is Blane, Jonas.
sergeant major. United States Army.
you think all you need to do is give me rank and name for three days?
well, I have some new intel for you, Blane, Jonas.
the sere school goes on for as long as i say it goes on.
three weeks, three months.
there is no rest for you.
all below the belt.
enemy wouldn't have his personal information.
you're living in the past.
enemy has a name, all they need is a good hacker and an internet connection to find every dirty detail of their life.
he's holding though.
damn straight he's holding.
now, I want an ambulance for Brown.
she could be lying about how long the drill's for.
could be.
case not, everyone better reset their clocks for way past three days.
guess we're on their time now.
lie down, maggot.
I can't accept special favors.
he's hyperventilating.
what's his health?
B. P.'s 90 over 60. Pulse 120.
lung sounds?
wheezing, extrinsic.
fever's 103 and change.
gunk in the trunk. Not good.
gain his trust. Play mama bear.
he's done playing. I want him pulled now.
want me to flunk him?
I want a medical exemption.
brown, this is Dr. Rhea Morrison.
you are very ill.
we would like you to lie down so we can administer medication and fluid.
are my mates getting something to drink?
that's my boy. They are.
you want to treat me, take me back with them.
treat me in front of them.
let me see they're getting taken care of too.
I can do that. Mr. Manning?
iraq, August 1999.
what was your squad's mission?
that's it, hose him down.
if Serena's latched onto something that makes her feel better, what's the big deal?
it's not the way Bob and I do it.
I thought you said Serena was christened.
I just assumed... yes, she was.
she saw my two girls praying, she wanted to join in.
of course she wants to do what they do. They're older.
I didn't see it as a problem.
now she thinks if she doesn't pray for her father if something happens to him it'll be her fault.
well, she misunderstood.
as 4-year-olds often do.
unless I'm the one putting it there.
I don't mean to be short.
no, you're just being clear.
Yes, I want to be clear.
and now you are. It won't happen again.
again.
I don't like the sound of this.
say the word, doctor.
let's call it quits.
brown, you just got a pass.
you're heading to the hospital.
I can't opt out of Sere. Not without my teammates.
I'd be kicked out of the unit.
no, this is a medical exemption.
you can't make me.
you're right soldier, but I can.
I'm the one making the decisions here.
it's my call. I'll call transport.
you go on and lie down.
we do need you to sign out on this line, Brown.
sign and let's get you some help, son.
and that by signing this document "I am not admitting...
to any treason, cooperation with an enemy of any kind.
sir?
it's not a break of faith.
What'd I sign?
you can't kick him out of the unit for a party trick.
I only need to appear to separate one to pry them all apart.
that's all I need you for, Colonel.
you may go.
what about going to the hospital?
I think you know the answer to that.
I signedan admission to cooperating with the enemy.
won't make your friends too happy.
I didn't...
prisoner number 602 will be brought into the interrogation room.
you will slap him, or I will use this document to flunk you out of Sere school, and you will be removed from the unit.
go on, hit him.
get him out of here.
get him out of here!
let's try again.
prisoner 604 is next. One slap, that's all.
brown, decide his fate.
as you wish. Guard.
okay, bring in the next one.
if sergeant Brown is uncooperative, be especially brutal with this one.
sergeant Brown.
thank you.
here's your water.
aren't you gonna give your commander the a-okay sign?
your boy broke.
signed his confession. Slapped you in the face.
you may go back to your cell now.
says he's with us, but looks to me like he's sitting pretty.
it's a setup.
brown didn't break faith.
maybe not, but he's drinking your water.
no, wrong. Not in here.
he doesn't go in with the others.
code's been broken.
code's broken.
what's that mean?
we got a problem with Brown?
where is he?
here you go.
how good a shot is Bob?
memory serves, pretty damn good.
cause if they did break him the traitor's now in possession of a rifle.
and what about faith?
Bob asked me that.
some have it, some don't.
and you're surviving all right without it?
I have so far.
and my daughter is fine too.
my whole family is fine.
prisoner, don't stack around that wire.
pick it the hell up.
you help him, you lazy bum.
traitor!
pull that crap up.
gonna take that?
Hey!
get off me!
turning against us?
isn't this cute?
now stop it!
maybe he doesn't know what he's doing.
you think not?
he slipped me this.
my objection is not that the tactics are brutal.
it's that they are worthless!
I know these men.
you will permanently maim them before they will bow to physical torture.
we've taken blood samples measuring epinephrine levels before and after stressors.
most soldiers show depleted levels of adrenaline after peak events.
your men?
they return to normal without a recovery period.
we need to find out why.
I finally figured you out, lady.
you're not here to train these men.
you're here to test some theory.
it's not a theory. The Algerians...
we do not follow in the footsteps of those who raise torture to an art form.
they're not our teachers.
your men are extraordinary.
don't you want to find out why?
I don't give a rat's ass why.
we do have one possible exception.
williams shows a slight norepinephrine drop.
his stanford-binet suggests he's most personally imprinted on his leader.
all the men look up to Jonas.
with Williams, there's a deeper almost familial bond.
and damned if you're not gonna exploit it.
williams Hector, I am an American fighting man. [Laughs]
fighting man? [Laughs]
that's right, you've been fighting all your life.
isn't that so, boy?
cause that's what they think of you, boy.
like your boy Jonas.
just another boy to them, doing their dirty work, putting his life on the line.
nobody cares.
look here.
is that your granddaddy?
Yes, it is, and nobody arrested for that crime.
he was a white man...
children of crisis, that's the lever.
his grandfather, 1952, hung from a tree in Alabama.
now family lore, but the kind never talked about.
that young man has overcome so much.
idea is, colonel, for him to overcome this.
now, I don't want you humiliated in front of these guys.
don't want you to break, son.
I tell them they can't break you.
cut you some slack.
cut Jonas some slack.
see, I'm not opposed to the psychological side, as long as you're willing to soften them up and then finish them off physically.
and you tell me anything you can so I can go easy on you.
williams: So it's Iraq.
we go in.
got to infiltrate the chateau being used for rest and entertainment, disrupt the chain of command.
can't tell you anymore.
sure you can, son.
you got to disrupt the chain. Yeah.
infiltrate.
we got to raid it.
people are gonna die.
first it was Wladislaw died.
minorities first, right? Yeah.
then Victor Franko. Italian.
bad-ass. Crazy as a loon.
then colonel's breathing down our backs.
do the job. Take 'em out.
Colonel Breed. Born with a gun in his hand.
Morrison: Tavish, check back records.
give me when Williams was under the command of a colonel Breed.
tell Tavish never mind.
we get background intel on this Breed, we can work Williams more if sergeant Manning doesn't finish him off first.
doctor, colonel Everett Breed is a character in a movie.
so are the other guys.
John Cassavettes and Charles Bronson.
you've been taken pick.
he's giving you the plot to the Dirty Dozen.
think that's funny?
you don't kill that boy, or you do kill him and any of his mates lives, we better take a head count of our family members, 'cause my men motivated and angry will not be deterred.
he's sedated.
versed. It's an amnesiac. He won't remember.
he dies, they'll remember.
we'll check his vitals again.
you'll be checking your own vital signs he gets any sicker.
let's see how the leader's holding.
Oh, for God...
hose him down and get the electroshock kit.
don't you dare!
I am in charge here!
do not mock the ways of the past.
they were born on the backs of men and women who were there.
you learn from them.
let me show you what works.
you're willing to bet your new position here?
you're right.
I'm only willing, Miss.
to do this job the way it's supposed to be done.
take 20.
you ok?
I didn't ask you to tell me if you were cooperating with the enemy.
I... I courteously enquire as to the state of your health.
[Sing-songing] You can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man.
the thing is, Jonas, I need your help.
brown is dangerously ill.
he's unconscious with a high fever and he's fading fast.
he went over, so treat him.
that's my point. He didn't.
the document he signed isn't the document he read.
it's just a trick to break the rest of you.
and this doctor woman won't treat him until somebody breaks.
you gotta stop her.
I tried. Ryan tried.
it's out of our hands.
I need your help.
we gotta work together to stop it.
is this what you wanted?
Yes, thank you.
this is Helene Rouse.
Ah! Another newbie.
from? Molly's church, actually.
and you're here to see me.
I was hoping to talk to you about some of the things that we have to offer at the first church...
no, thank you.
this is very wrong.
I'm not trying to drag you into a cult.
Helene's here to tell you all the church has to offer by way of support.
meetings, focus groups, there's baby-sitting.
things for you to do to...
forget? Keep busy.
this is only informational.
on how to get connected.
I'll tell you what I'm connected to.
memory.
I remember my husband and I planning a christening for a baby I lost last year.
and my mother's minister said, "it's God's will.
to let a baby die?
Really?
well, I've got another one on the way, and he's just gonna have to rely on me.
I'm sorry Molly wasted your time.
that was a plant. You're right.
it's not about connecting.
it's about reconnecting.
I'm sorry you lost a child, Kim.
was that God's will? I have no idea.
but I've been a part of this man's army many years, and what I know is it is our will that keeps the home fires burning, our will that lets our men leave and walk into harm's way, our will that allows us to survive if something happens to them, and for me, that's a kind of faith.
now, what is it that you're looking for?
it doesn't have to be my church or any church at all, but it's gotta be something.
look at here. It's Christmas.
you could have drunk that, but you need to wash your dainties.
grey: Hey, you ok?
I got to lie down.
you playing nurse or are you gonna clean up?
I wash when I wash, Hector.
you ain't my mama.
puppies nippin' at each other. That's a good sign.
the system's screwed up.
and who pays? You men.
I thought: Take this job.
identify the problems. Fix the problems.
but it's a cancer now.
the pentagon wouldn't know what it was doing if the info was hand-delivered up their butt.
you need to break faith.
sign our document and save Brown.
you can't trust him anymore. Brown changed teams.
Mack: He looks bad.
I don't care.
he's with us. He gave us a magazine.
Yeah, or he was play-acting.
I guess we'll just have to ask him.
tell your mom I'll drop by around 8: 00.
it's a trick.
no.
I resigned my position.
I'm just trying to save Brown.
my name is Blane.
this is not a drill anymore.
this is life or death of one of your men.
do you understand me?
I'm a sergeant major in the United States army.
I'm talking to you as your oldest and best friend, and I'm telling you you're the only person that can save that kid.
my old friend?
Yes.
and I swear on our friendship that the only thing that'll save Brown is breaking your faith and signing the confession.
Jonas, you're responsible for him.
I'll get the papers.
water salty enough to make it work?
you better hope so.
20 seconds before they wonder what the hell we 're doing.
I'm almost done.
can you get me another angle on that camera?
come on!
I got it.
all available men to the holding cell!
find this amusing, colonel?
ma'am, I find this nothing short of hilarious.
I am an American fighting man.
lock it down... where are those guards?
just sign these papers for Brown.
Bob: Top?
Bob: I got you, top.
you swore on our friendship.
I had to prove her wrong.
right.
all's fair.
what the hell's going on in here?
good to see you. Mack?
he should be in the woods.
Mack had the gate. Tie him up.
no. He ain't going nowhere.
Ahem.
sere ain't over.
Breakout's not on the approved list of activities.
and I thought SERE meant "survive, evade, resist, escape."
back inside.
you're lucky this is just a drill.
otherwise, we'd already be a few miles away from here.
come on, soldier. Let's get you some help.
steady him.
Chelas: Congratulations, gentlemen.
you have survived SERE school.
they've got the fever down a little.
they're worried about infection, but they say in a week or so he should be fine.
what did you do to him?
too much.
kim: Hey.
when they called me and told me how you were, I got so scared.
and I did something waiting for the ride, I realized I was praying.
waiting for the ride, I realized I was praying.
not hands clasped, not on my knees, but something over and over.
don't let him die.
and that's prayer, right?
and if that's prayer, it's gotta be a kind of faith.
you're a little bit ahead of me in the faith department, but I'm working on it.
you really got me working on it, baby.
Shh.
Shh. You just go to sleep.
we're gonna be ok.
you sick, soldier?
well, Colonel, I have a little cold.
you have a little cold.
correct answer's "no, sir" or "yes, sir."
you feel like standing up?
what you're looking at, sergeant major, is what in the real Brownshoe army used to be known as an ass-chewing.
might I be permitted to ask this general title, sir?
this general title is I see your men here reading and coughing and doing everything under god's blue sky except for studying the SERE manual.
well, Colonel-- - Why is it I don't see you studying the SERE manual?
brown? Last time you did SERE school?
about a year ago. - You find the tactics changed at SERE?
Yes, sir. They were harsher.
had about a 20% dropout/failure rate.
these men need to be prepared for being captured in enemy territory.
you will, as their captors, attempt to get them to confess that they betrayed our country, been traitors to the USA.
you will deprive them of sleep.
you will make fun of their genitalia.
we can do that, sir. - But you will not touch their genitalia.
you heard the man. - Heavens, no.
you think SERE school's a drill? - We are the drill bit.
that's right. It ain't drill.
and should these soldiers break in SERE, what's in their christmas stocking?
demotion to civilian, something like that.
any of you thinking about being lenient, who are you gonna save that for?
our pets and babies, Colonel.
most assuredly.
you're acting as guards.
you got to put these fellas through the wringer, bring back the news who's gonna break and who's gonna stand.
Mr. Williams. - Sir?
you have the habit of imitating your betters?
only those, Sir, I admire unreservedly.
you sick, soldier?
well, Colonel, I have a little cold.
you ought to get that looked at.
you're dating someone named Puffy?
not anymore, apparently.
uh, I have an announcement.
um...it's a boy.
Congratulations.
you guys drop the bomb "it's a boy" in a unit that doesn't ever have boys.
Yeah, what's that about? Natural selection?
well, us men have a different theory.
Yes, and it isn't appropriate to be shared in mixed company.
let me guess. Has to do with the famed sexual prowess of special forces soldiers.
you said it, not me.
you excited? - Are you kidding? Over the moon.
well, I'd be happy to hold the christening party at my house.
Thanks, but we're not. - Did you christen Serena?
Yes. - But not this one.
not this time.
you didn't say I shouldn't tell anyone.
everyone has expectations of what I should do.
of what we should do.
a christening. - No.
we planned a christening for the other one.
and we canceled it.
I'm not going through that again.
baby, Serena was fine.
okay? This one will be fine too.
have faith-- - You have faith. I still have fear.
go take a hot shower, aspirin, gargle.
you are still going to this thing?
how sick are you?
not bad. - You can opt out.
I'm good for guard duty.
I've been on one or two of these where things got a little too real for the guards.
keep control and remember it's just a drill.
last chance.
okay, then.
here we go.
cakewalk.
you think?
guys.
are you kidding me?
this is USA Army SERE training drill.
survival, evasion, resistance, escape.
you will relinquish all weapons to your captors now.
captors?
Grey.
stand down.
stay down.
looks like your old pal got a new job.
alpha team.
welcome to SERE.
you have been captured.
you are now prisoners of war.
A-ten-hut!
no eyes on my flag.
you ain't fitting to look at my flag.
you do not look at our flag while our anthem plays.
drop and do push-ups till I get tired.
this man is a P. O. W. like you, he's failed in his mission.
this man is a little better than vermin. We do not coddle vermin.
we step on it.
this man is a sellout. Get the hell up.
fast start.
what's the point of a slow one? I came here to make changes.
form up.
guards, receive the prisoners.
all prisoners strip now.
you look at me and my men, you lose an eye.
sergeant major Cheals, my men should not...
her men now.
break them to flake them, Colonel ryan.
left face!
Hut! Hunh!
column right, hunh!
opt out.
prisoners, halt. Right face!
are these swine infested?
Yes, sergeant, they are.
put these on double-time.
learn these numbers. You have no names now.
I am a lineman for the county and I drive in the main road. Brown, code of conduct, article one.
I am an American fighting man.
Williams, chair of surveillance and intel.
Grey, health committee.
sign no confessions. Do not admit clandestine ops.
accept no special favors.
first and foremost, keep faith with each other and your country.
our signal for "a-okay, I'm with you."
signal for danger, beware.
I know I need a long vacation go ahead and split them up.
I'd say let them rip. We got three days.
this isn't your old-school military where we keep troop positions secret for 24 hours.
our world takes hostages solely for propaganda value.
international law does not apply. There are no nice guys.
if we don't train our men for that, we're preparing them to fail.
your boy's ill? -Yes, ma'am.
men get sick. Whole point of torture, break them down, split them apart.
they're ill, we're one step ahead in the game.
here. Saw another exit here.
all right. Egress one. This is two. Only if one fails.
saw a couple of windows might be vulnerable.
your coughing's a tell that gonna put us all in danger.
any extra water, give it to Brown. Keep his throat wet.
we find a way to escape. Absent that, we hang tough for three days.
keep each other strong. Get back to our jobs.
I ain't letting one of you get kicked out of the unit over some drills.
I'm pulling Brown. - Absolutely not.
they break here, they're out.
they break in Iraq, Afghanistan, they're traitors and they're dead.
now, what do you want to do with Glen Campbell?
huddle up, protect Brown.
grey must be heading up the health committee.
I don't see him handing out any bandages.
you didn't hear jonas handing out assignments, but he did.
nobody in your precious D. O. D. warned you not to underestimate this group?
we got to conserve body heat.
fall in. We're gonna huddle.
think warm thoughts. Keep your body on Brown.
no matter what, keep faith with your mates.
get some rest. I'm not tired.
you will be, and you're our leader, so get some rest now.
like I said, health committee.
this'll be over soon enough.
don't bet on it.
ahh, romance, music, moonlight.
now, you can't beat that.
courtesy of my friends in Viet Nam.
your friends use anything other than noise to get results.
play it long enough, it'll cut to the gut.
maybe that's why the Vietnam war lasted for so damn long.
in my experience
you want to be the new head of SERE, you've got to learn the new way.
Serena, I found it. You left it underneath my dollies, and god bless daddy so he doesn't get hurt.
honey? What you doing?
praying for daddy.
we don't do that, baby.
we talk about daddy when he's working.
we-- - Lissy and Jen do it.
come here, baby doll.
you learn about praying last night at Lissy and Jen's house?
jen says if she prays, her daddy will be safe, but if she doesn't...
Rena, daddy's always safe in our hearts.
we don't have to get on our knees. We just have to love him.
do you love him? - All the time.
your job is done then.
now, into bed, pumpkin.
No!
you do not miss a stone!
your mama told you that you were stupid, didn't she?
you will pick up every stone...
here's our weak link.
that's a poor excuse of a man.
pull him.
take me!
he's sick.
I seen your file, soldier.
you have no brothers.
your father had no brothers.
your mother had no brothers.
your wife has no brothers.
but your wife is carrying a son.
who's the father?
what color will your son be?
will they call the boy "boy"?
little Charles? Little Hector? Or Jonas' son?
or your son, soldier, just to be kind?
enough of the pleasantries. Let's see what he's made of.
start on the kidneys.
this ain't drill. Not anymore.
you thirsty? - My name is Williams hector.
I am a sergeant in the United States army.
the water here is yours, you tell me whether or not it's true you were not part of recent clandestine operations in afghanistan.
if you are able to confirm your absence from that mission, son, you'll be excused, go on home.
your friend took a bad beating.
he's awful sick.
you want to visit him? Take him some medicine?
fine. Let him get sicker.
no?
show him the monitor.
your mate isn't looking too good.
you can stop this.
Gerhardt Mack.
I am a master sergeant in the United States army.
beat on the kidneys.
name, rank, and service number.
what the hell were you thinking, jumping the guard again?
prisoners are not to harass or interfere with the administration of the camp.
unless it serves a greater objective.
resistance.
how's getting yourself beaten to a pulp with a flashlight manage that?
the light at the end of the tunnel, huh?
come with me.
I understand you requested medical attention for one of the men.
you are the senior officer?
my name is Blane Jonas. Sergeant Major. U. S. Army.
you know, I've studied 150 men in your unit.
black, White, Asian, Hispanic, rich, poor, city kids, country bumpkins.
finally found the one thing connecting you all.
you know what that thing is, sergeant?
my name is Blane Jonas. Sergeant Major. United states army.
you're all children of adversity.
poverty, lack of love, drunken mothers, abusive fathers.
you all found your way here, didn't you？
question I have for the man, though, is what secret is you holding onto?
you must be hoping for a speedy return to your lovely wife and, what, your whore on the side?
feeding your lust with a cheap little piece? Aren't you ashamed?
your own daughter.
Betsy Blane, 19 years old.
according to her gynecologist, sexually active since age 14.
think it was a ploy for attention given your many absences?
price you pay. Price your child pays.
because as a physician I worry, knowing the significant correlation between hypersexuality and childhood abuse.
how about it?
was Betsy daddy's little girl?
who touched you as a kid?
made you want to touch your own daughter.
sorry, my mind was elsewhere.
your sister was uncle's little girl, wasn't she?
you didn't tell, now, did you?
my name is Blane Jonas. Sergeant Major. United states army.
you think all you need to do is give me rank and name for three days?
well, I have some new intel for you, Blane Jonas.
the SERE school goes on for as long as I say it goes on.
three weeks, three months.
there is no rest for you.
all below the belt. Enemy wouldn't have his personal information.
you're living in the past.
enemy has a name, all thing need is a good hacker and an internet connection to find every dirty detail of their life.
he's holding though. - Damn straight he's holding.
now, I want an ambulance for Brown.
she could be lying about how long the drill's for.
could be.
case not, everyone would better reset their clocks for way past three days.
guess we're on their time now.
lie down, maggot.
I can't accept special favors.
he's hyperventilating. - What's his health?
B. P.'s 90 over 60. Pulse 120.
lung sounds? - Wheezing, extrinsic.
fever's 103 and change. - Gunk in the trunk. Not good.
gain his trust. Play mama bear.
he's done playing. I want him pulled now.
want me to flunk him? -I want a medical exemption.
brown, this is Dr. Rhea Morrison.
you are very ill.
we would like you to lie down so we can administer medication and fluid.
are my mates getting something to drink?
that's my boy. -they are.
you want to treat me, take me back with them.
treat me in front of them. Let me see they're getting taken care of too.
I can do that. Mr. Manning?
iraq, August 1999.
what was your squad's mission?
that's it, hose him down.
if Serena's latched onto something that makes her feel better, what's the big deal?
it's not the way Bob and I do it.
I thought you said Serena was christened. I just assumed
Yes, she was.
she saw my two girls praying, she wanted to join in.
of course she wants to do what they do. They're older.
she'd follow them into the middle of a busy highway if there was no one there to stop her.
I didn't see it as a problem.
now she thinks if she doesn't pray for her father if something happens to him it'll be her fault.
well, she misunderstood. - As 4-year-olds often do.
I don't want god and religion and guilt and damnation put into her head unless I'm the one putting it there.
I don't mean to be short. - No, you're just being clear.
Yes, I want to be clear.
and now you are. It won't happen again.
again.
I don't like the sound of this. - Say the word, doctor.
let's call it quits.
brown, you just got a pass. You're heading to the hospital.
I can't opt out of SERE. Not without my teammates. I'd be kicked out of the unit.
no, this is a medical exemption.
you can't make me. - You're right soldier, but I can.
I'm the one making the decisions here. It's my call. I'll call transport.
you go on and lie down.
we do need you to sign out on this line, Brown.
sign and let's get you some help, son.
and that by signing this document "I am not admitting to any treason, cooperation with an enemy of any kind." sir?
it's not a break of faith.
What'd I sign?
you can't kick him out of the unit for a party trick.
I only need to appear to separate one to pry them all apart.
that's all I need you for, Colonel.
you may go.
what about going to the hospital?
I think you know the answer to that. - I signed an admission to cooperating with the enemy.
won't make your friends too happy. - I didn't
prisoner number 602 will be brought into the interrogation room.
you will slap him, or I will use this document to flunk you out of SERE school, and you will be removed from the unit.
go on, hit him.
get him out of here. Get him out of here!
let's try again.
prisoner 604 is next. One slap, that's all.
brown, decide his fate.
as you wish. Guard.
okay, bring in the next one.
if sergeant Brown is uncooperative, be especially brutal with this one.
sergeant Brown.
thank you.
here's your water.
aren't you gonna give your commander the a-okay signal?
your boy broke.
signed his confession. Slapped you in the face.
you may go back to your cell now.
says he's with us, but looks to me like he's sitting pretty.
it's a setup.
brown didn't break faith.
maybe not, but he's drinking your water.
no, wrong. Not in here. He doesn't go in with the others.
code's been broken.
code's broken.
what's that mean? We got a problem with Brown?
where is he?
how good a shot is Bob?
memory serves, pretty damn good.
because if they did break him, the traitor's now in possession of a rifle.
and what about faith?
Bob asked me that.
some have it, some don't.
and you're surviving all right without it?
I have so far.
and my daughter is fine too.
my whole family is fine.
prisoner, don't stack around that wire.
pick it the hell up.
you help him, you lazy bum.
traitor!
pull that crap up.
gonna take that?
Hey!
get off me!
turning against us?
isn't this cute?
now stop it!
maybe he doesn't know what he's doing.
you think not?
he slipped me this.
my objection is not that the tactics are brutal. It's that they are worthless!
I know these men.
you will permanently maim them before they will bow to physical torture.
we've taken blood samples measuring epinephrine levels before and after stressors.
most soldiers show depleted levels of adrenaline after peak events. Your men?
they return to normal without a recovery period. We need to find out why.
I finally figured you out, lady.
you're not here to train these men. You're here to test some theory.
it's not a theory. The algerians
we do not follow in the footsteps of those who raise torture to an art form.
they're not our teachers.
your men are extraordinary. Don't you want to find out why?
I don't give a rat's ass why.
we do have one possible exception.
williams shows a slight norepinephrine drop.
his stanford-binet suggests he's most personally imprinted on his leader.
all the men look up to Jonas.
with Williams, there's a deeper almost familial bond.
and damned if you're not gonna exploit it.
Williams, Hector. I am an American fighting man.
fighting man?
that's right, you've been fighting all your life. Isn't that so, boy?
because that's what they think of you, boy.
like your boy Jonas.
just another boy to them, doing their dirty work putting his life on the line. Nobody cares.
look here.
is that your granddaddy?
Yes, it is, and nobody arrested for that crime.
he was a white man...
children of crisis, that's the lever.
his grandfather, 1952, hung from a tree in Alabama.
now family lore, but the kind never talked about.
that young man has overcome so much.
idea is, Colonel, for him to overcome this.
now, I don't want you humiliated in front of these guys.
don't want you to break, son.
I tell them they can't break you.
cut you some slack.
cut Jonas some slack.
see, I'm not opposed to the psychological side, as long as you're willing to soften them up and then finish them off physically.
and you tell me anything you can so I can go easy on you.
so it's Iraq.
we go in.
can't tell you anymore. - Sure you can, son.
you got to disrupt the chain. - Yeah.
infiltrate.
we got to raid it. People are gonna die.
first it was Wladisla died.
minorities first, right? - Yeah.
then victor franko. -italian.
bad-ass. Crazy as a loon.
then Colonel's breathing down our backs.
do the job. Take 'em out.
Colonel Breed.
born with a gun in his hand.
robert ryan.
Tavish, check back records.
give me when Williams was under the command of a Colonel breed.
tell Tavish never mind.
we get background intel on this breed, we can work Williams more if sergeant manning doesn't finish him off first.
doctor, Colonel Everett breed is a character in a movie.
so are the other guys. John Cassavettes and Charles Bronson.
you've been taken, pick. He's giving you the plot to the dirty dozen.
think that's funny?
you don't kill that boy, or you do kill him and any of his mates lives, we better take a head count of our family members, because my men motivated and angry will not be deterred.
he's sedated. Versed. It's an amnesiac. He won't remember.
he dies, they'll remember. - We'll check his vitals again.
you'll be checking your own vital signs he gets any sicker.
let's see how the leader's holding.
Oh, for god
hose him down and get the electroshock kit.
don't you dare! -I am in charge here!
do not mock the ways of the past.
they were born on the backs of men and women who were there.
you learn from them.
let me show you what works.
you're willing to bet your new position here? You're right.
I'm only willing, miss. To do this job the way it's supposed to be done.
take 20.
you ok?
I didn't ask you to tell me if you were cooperating with the enemy.
I--I courteously enquire as to the state of your health.
you can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man.
the thing is, Jonas, I need your help.
brown is dangerously ill.
he's unconscious with a high fever and he's fading fast.
he went over, so treat him. - That's my point. He didn't.
the document he signed isn't the document he read. It's just a trick to break the rest of you.
and this doctor woman won't treat him until somebody breaks.
you gotta stop her. - I tried. Ryan tried.
it's out of our hands. I need your help.
we gonna stop this thing together - Is this what you wanted? - Yes, thank you.
this is Helene Rouse.
Ah! Another newbie. From?
Molly's church, actually.
and you're here to see me.
I was hoping to talk to you about some of the things that we have to offer at the first church
no, thank you.
this is very wrong.
I'm not ying to drag you into a cult.
Helene's here to tell you all the church has to offer by way of support.
meetings, focus groups, there's baby-sitting. Things for you to do to
forget? - Keep busy.
this is only informational, on how to get connected.
I'll tell you what I'm connected to.
memory.
I remember my husband and I planning a christening for a baby I lost last year.
and my mother's minister said, "it's god's will."
to let a baby die?
Really?
well, I've got another one on the way, and he's just gonna have to rely on me.
I'm sorry Molly wasted your time.
that was a plant. - You're right.
it's not about connecting. It's about reconnecting.
I'm sorry you lost a child, Kim.
was that god's will? I have no idea.
but I've been a part of this man's army many years, and what I know is it is our will that keeps the home fires burning, our will that lets our men leave and walk into harm's way, our will that allows us to survive if something happens to them, and for me, that's a kind of faith.
now, what is it that you're looking for?
it doesn't have to be my church or any church at all, but it's gotta be something.
look here. It's christmas.
you could have drunk that but you need to wash your dainties.
Hey, you ok? - I got to lie down.
you playing nurse or are you gonna clean up?
I wash when I wanna wash, Hector.
you ain't my mama.
puppies are nipping at each other. That's a good sign.
the system's screwed up. And who pays? You men.
I thought: take this job.
identify the problems. Fix the problems.
but it's a cancer now.
the pentagon wouldn't know what it was doing if the info was hand-delivered up their butt.
you need to break faith.
sign our document and save Brown.
you can't trust him anymore. Brown changed teams.
he looks bad.
I don't care.
he's with us. He gave us a magazine.
Yeah, or he was play-acting.
I guess we'll just have to ask him.
tell your mom I'll drop by around 8: 00.
it's a trick.
no.
I resigned my position.
I'm just trying to save Brown.
my name is Blane.
this is not a drill anymore.
this is life or death of one of your men. Do you understand me?
I'm talking to you as your oldest and best friend, and I'm telling you you're the only person that can save that kid.
my old friend?
Yes.
and I swear on our friendship that the only thing that'll save Brown is breaking your faith and signing the confession.
Jonas, you're responsible for him.
I'll get the papers.
water salty enough to make it work?
you better hope so.
20 seconds before they wonder what the hell we'redoing.
I'm almost done.
can you get me another angle on that camera?
come on!
I got it.
all available men to the holding cell!
find this amusing, Colonel?
ma'am, I find this nothing short of hilarious.
I am an American fighting man.
lock it down-- Where are those guards?
just sign these papers for Brown.
top?
brown?
I got you, top.
you swore on our friendship.
I had to prove her wrong.
right. All's fair.
what the hell's going on in here?
good to see you. Mack?
he should be in the woods. - Mack had the gate. Tie him up.
no. He ain't going anyhere.
sere ain't over.
Breakout's not on the approved list of activities.
and I thought SERE meant "survive, evade, resist, escape."
back inside.
you're lucky this is just a drill.
otherwise, we'd already be a few miles away from here.
come on, soldier. Let's get you some help.
steady him.
congratulations, gentlemen.
you have survived SERE school.
they've got the fever down a little.
they're worried about infection, but they say in a week or so he should be fine.
what did you do to him?
too much.
Hey.
when they called me and told me how you were, I got so scared.
and I did something.
waiting for the ride, I realized I was praying.
not hands clasped, not on my knees, but something over and over.
don't let him die.
and that's prayer, right?
and if that's prayer, it's gotta be a kind of faith.
you're a little bit ahead of me in the faith department, but I'm working on it.
you really got me working on it, baby.
Shh. You just go to sleep.
we're gonna be ok.
just sleep.
this is bob brown -welcome to the unit, bob -thank you, sergeant no man on the team like just drive this kim brown that's laurenda george, good friend. kim brown, wife of coworker.
that what are you calling me now, a friend?
I said a good friend, baby guys, is bob off-duty too?
at the office your husband deployed?
no, he's a clerk it is our willing that keeps the home fires burning, our will that lets our men leave and walk into harm's way mister.
kites.
that means a new drug shipment is in.
I see the kites.
I don't see any evidence of a downed plane.
keep lookin'.
no man's land.
man, woman, or child.

cameras down.
Oh, no! no!"no, please

Yes. i will.
you speak english.
who are you? -fella with some money.
you pay me, i answer one question. -ok.
Where'd you learn english?
my mother cleaned the house of american in rio.
Where's your mother now? -dead.
that man over there...
I wanna take a picture of an airplane.
you take me to this plane, i give you more money.
I'll take you to the airport.
no, i don't want to see that kind of plane.
I want to see the plane where you got this.
I bought it...in the street.
if i was you, money i had, i'd buy some food.
Where'd you get the headset?
now, i don't want to give this photo to to a policeman over there, now, would i?
let him see how cozy you are with the americans?
drug eradication plane.
must have been sprayin' for cocoa.
all right, what else did you take?
I don't call this nothin'.
I didn't get that here.
now, that's the last lie i want to hear from you.
I'm gonna mess you up real bad and take back all that money.
let him go.
you want to look at this.
adolpho shot him down. surface-to-air missile.
he was bragging he had sams.
well...I guess he does.
question is what he plans to do?
you haven't known her that long. marriage is a serious thing.
Jonas said i should get your advice on t subject.
have you met her family?
no. i'm about to. - that'll tell you a lot.
thinking of proposing to her, not her family.
you are young, aren't you?
she thinks i'm a clerk in the 303rd.
what's your question?
when do i tell her what i do for real?
that's not your job.
it's not?
when you decide to make her your family, you'll bring her to us women.
we'll tell her what she needs to know.
see? you've just learned something new.
16-year-old boy come to take my daughter to a movie...
wearin' a shirt that reads,"stamp out virginity"?
can you imagine? you remember that, celeste?
big decision at that point? kill or just maim?
Oh, i beat that boy all the way down the street.
past the church and the police station.
beat him till he was in his mama's kitchen.
let him live so he could remember that beatin'.
dear god.
see, i didn't really like that boy anyhow.
I just brought him home to put a burr under his saddle.
let me ask you a question here, hector. -sir?
you look healthy enough. you got all 10 fingers?
Yes, sir.
you know how to squeeze a trigger? -i had basic training.
do you enjoy the military? -yes, sir, i do.
and tell me how a young, healthy man like you can look at hisself in the mirror workin' in an office with a bunch of skirts.
daddy.
it's a fair question. i want to hear his answer.
sir, i'm good at what i do, and it needs doin'.
managing logistics requires-- -a gentle temperament and a sore ass.
excuse me.
I apologize. i have to go.
are there some papers in serious need of pushin'?
none but the brave deserve the fair.
you ever hear that, son?
and i'm not trying to hurt your feelings, but my daughter is no consolation prize.
I agree, sir.
well, it speaks well of you that you do.
I have to report to work.
thank you for the hospitality, ma'am.
it was a pleasure to meet you, hector.
I'll walk you out.
just pop the question. that's all you can do.
it's a contract you sign first, and then it's the woman's choice.
who's gettin' married? -me, colonel.
well, just not today.
this here on the right is ricardo ruiz.
I heard ruiz was killed in a car accident in belize last week.
well, it's a good thing that's what you heard because he's alive and well and in our brig on base tellin' us all about his friends around the globe.
one such amigo is this man: adolpho jiminez.
brazilian drug lord who's now dabblin' in arms.
what kind of weapons? -surface-to-air missiles.
Ruiz claims that his buddy in brazil got ahold of a crateload.
he's already used one to down a drug eradication plane.
plans to sell the rest to the highest bidder.
and who's that?
better be you, because we hear the islamic brigade of basra city's sniffin' around down there for sams to take down our blackhawks.
maybe a civilian plane or two here in the u. s.
and if they outbid us on the sams?
what you can't buy, you're gonna have to take.
plane leaves in an hour. jonas and charlie are already down there.
Jiminez has 4 guard teams on the perimeter.
ak-47s.
hate to tell you, but these are our kids.
Oh, boy.
somethin' catch your eye? -just saw an old friend.
thank you. have a nice day. -thank you. you, too.
thought you'd be out buying t-bones and caviar.
can you believe it? molly's a genius.
we made 10% on our first investment in less than a month.
goin' straight into the kids' college fund.
so, we're not invited for steaks?
you're welcome for spaghetti.
unless i get evicted. have you seen these?
it's just a warning. your front yard.
weeds are overgrown. -no. really.
it's citation 621-j2. 621's your yard, j2's weeds.
gotta get a weed whacker. i'd loan you ours, but it broke.
Oh, come on! this is ridiculous!
bring it to the f. r.g. meeting tonight. you can appeal it.
I have a paper due. -pay the fine, then.
Where's the meeting?
my husband's check is 2 days late. -i'm sorry.
it's only $20. i need...the money.
your account is overdrawn.
well, give me credit for the p. x. so that i can feed my son!
there's no credit here. it'd cost me my job.
rec center. 5: 00.
all i want is what my family is owed.
I'm sorry, but it's procedure. we've been
is there a problem? -hey, your listening to my business is a problem.
just needed a little help.
army finance screwed up our pay again.
I can loan you some money... for essentials.
I can't let you do that. -sure, you can.
I'm havin' a good day. -well, i'm not, and i don't take charity.
it's not charity if you pay me back. -it's not
I'm fine.
she'll go to lucky larry's, get a payday advance.
an army wife has to go to a loan shark to buy milk?
you new on base?
nice flight? -it landed.
had a flight attendant right up your alley.
hope you passed on my number. -i sure did.
he's gonna call you when he gets back to the states.
hope you're hungry. -i'm starvin'.
good...because i'm making.
much more of that...
you might get dessert, too.
I apologize for our meeting's length, and i'm afraid we're gonna have to put off the other business and the community comments until the next time because we still need an update with the sidewalk address painti and the red, white, and blue garden project. now
excuse me. i don't mean to interrupt, but i have sat here for 2 hours in order to bring up my other business
please. please.
introduce yourself and tell us your husband's rank.
kim brown. my husband bob works for the 303rd logistical.
he's an n. c.o.
thank you for coming, kim. my name is kathryn pratt.
I am the president of the family readiness group, and my husband is general edward pratt.
pleased to meet you.
I received this letter which seems to be a warning that i'll be fined if my front yard-- my weeds-- don't meet some sort of standard, and...
I'm not sure to what standard it refers.
our steering committee sets the standards.
you are new to ft. griffith? -yes.
perhaps you failed to read the wives' manual, or even failed to receive one.
Molly gave me the full welcome package. -well, should you read it, you will learn that we do enforce community standards for lawn upkeep, and we recently initiated the red, white, and blue flower project, and buying in bulk, i was able to procure a discount so that the plants will only come to $22.
I have neighbors going to loan sharks to buy their groceries.
how can you expect folks to spend money on flowers?
well, maybe you have forgotten the importance of such gestures with your husband not in combat.
I just think there may be some more vital issues that family readiness can address.
why don't you put your thoughts in writing and bring them to the general meeting on thursday, kim.
but don't delay responding to that 621-j2, as there is an added fine for a late payment.
so, moving on now.
now, each flat here is prearranged in red-and-white impatience and blue lobelia.
I wanted to tell her my husband's one of the top 150 elite soldiers in the world, and then punch her right in the throat.
you made a point about needy families on the base.
Oh, you think so?
but you can't barge in and turn an old, stuffy institution around on a dime.
but you're smart. perhaps you know what you're doing.
what's that? -writing us off.
making sure the f. r.g. is a waste of your time.
otherwise, you might have to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty.
join your partner. the band just started playing.
we're here to see adolpho jiminez.
who are you? what do you want?
anyone here speak english? -i do. he asked who you were.
tell him we're here to do business with your boss.
tell him we're friends of ricardo ruiz.
Mr. jiminez.
Mr. jiminez.
my name is liam higgins. this is owen donnelly.
we represent a certain irish-american constituency.
we're looking for a friend.
who might that be? -he calls himself sam.
we understand you might be of some assistance.
why would i do that?
well, you would be well compensated.
who are you? i.r. a.?
I thought you made peace with the british.
we're not i. r.a.
and you wouldn't catch us signin' a bleedin' peace treaty when there's still a war on.
does it matter who we are? we have the money.
$500, 000. the other 5 upon delivery.
for how many sams? -for all of them.
how did you find me?
we have a mutual friend. ricardo ruiz.
and when did he tell you about me? -i spoke to him 2 days ago.
you failed to do your homework. ricardo died last week.
I'll kill him. -go ahead.
there's a thousand others to fill his shoes.
hold it. wait. hold on. look at this.
you'll note the newspaper's 2 days old.
you think i don't know pictures can be faked?
ricardo faked his own death...
to avoid some problems he was having with the salvadorans.
you mean with the bolivians. -no. he paid off mr. bonita.
it was mr. alaria in el salvador who was growing impatient.
I can get ruiz on the phone right now.
I'm happy you're alive, my friend yes, i understand very well. goodbye ben.
you sensed i would not shoot one of my boys.
I've grown too fond of them.
I mean, it's... a weakness i must correct one day.
ricardo says you are a man of your word.
then show us the bloody rockets.
these aren't just any sams. these are stingers.
as they say..."made in america.
we'll take all seven. -not so fast.
there are other bidders. -who?
men such as yourself, who also do not like an occupying army on their land.
we'll take them all.
ricardo's word got you a look, not a sale.
with competitors, the price has gone up.
how much? -2 million for the seven.
I'd have to make a call. -make your call.
I'm sure in a couple of days... -you have until tomorrow.
Colonel ryan?
Ryan.
we can confirm they have the dress in your wife's size.
but we're gonna need some more buttons.
how many buttons?-double the original amount.
copy that if i have a couple of weeks...
negative. the fashion show starts tomorrow.
my investors won't authorize any more buttons goin' to that particular supplier.
understood. but there are complications.
which are?
a lot of child labor in the factory.
close thtransaction... child labor or not.
Roger.
we're to obtain the stingers... if not with money, then by force.
that's a lot of kids to go through.
anyone has any ideas of how to go around them instead...clock's tickin'.
here you go...
your first real estate profit-- $400, free and clear.
and the other half goes back into the kitty?
for our club's next purchase.
there's a warehouse on the interstate i've got my eye on.
maybe we should buy out lucky larry.
good way to lose our souls.
well, i've been thinking about what you said...
and i've been checkin' out these loan sharks.
35% interest, they charge these poor women.
just 60 days. it goes to 40. i've been there.
and they contact your superior officer if you default.
is that legal? -army frowns on debt.
but the f. r.g. could help.
like with our investment club.
we could pool resources.
instead of buyin' flowers, e could have dues...
or even use some of the investment club's kitty as seed money.
bill gates didn't get philanthropic his first quarter.
I'm just sayin'.
according to the f. r.g. handbook
you found your welcome packet, did you?
there is nothin' in the bylaws to prevent the f. r.g. from providin' a safety net.
I look forward to you selling kathryn on this.
nothin' in the bylaws to prevent a regime change, either.
well i did lay down the gauntlet.
molly...if i get involved... i mean, i'm new here. nobody knows me.
and if i get things rollin', can i count you in?
I'm not opposed to new ideas.
Tom.
hateus. damn, it's good to see you.
what the hell brings you down here?
well, let's talk. -come on in. sit down, sit down.
how's the family? -well, that's why i'm here.
laurenda. -how is laurenda?
she's gettin' serious about a soldier.
about a soldier? wait a minute. she's...
she's how old? -23, tom.
where does it go? what's so bad about a soldier?
well, the problem is...the man that my laurenda's so fond of lacks ambition.
I'm tryin' to get him out of a cubicle and into the 82nd.
done. what's his name? -hector williams.
I have asked, all up and down the base. can't find a damn thing out about the boy.
I mean, must be buried in a basement somewhere with the filin' cabinets.
you need to stand down, hateus. -stand down?
no more questions about williams. we clear?
you sayin'...?
I'm sayin' you need to stand down.
really.
really.
they're shooting! they're shooting!
there are six of them! over there!
we're under fire!
return fire! return fire!
help me! let's go!
they're still shooting!
come here. we're going to find out what's going on you come with me. the boys stay here tell them go get it under control i see one.
there were seven.
we're missing six.
how's the fireworks show holdin' up? -we're on our last few.
make 'em last. we need more time.
you're about to hear the real thing, boss. we got visitors.
Roger that.
call off your soldiers. tell them they're just fireworks.
and then tell them to go home... now.
it's just fireworks you fools! stop shooting!
go home now! all of you!
I said go home now, damn it! all of you!
now close the door.
2 nostrils. 2 ears. 2 eyes.
we clear who's in charge here? -yes.
where are the stingers? -i kept one.
and the rest? -i sold them.
to whom? -the islamic brigade.
how long ago? -40 minutes.
where are they taking them? -out of the country.
from where? -i don't know.
from where? -i don't know.
I just know they are going to sneak them into america...
to shoot down planes... for passenger flights.
you have 2 children in a boarding school in london.
this look like them?
if i ever hear of you selling weapons again... i will bring you their severed heads.
that will be the last thing you see in this life.
you understand me?
you deaf? or you understand me?
I understand.
I took a few prisoners. where are the other stingers?
out of our control.

I am pleased to see so many new members here.
and per the f. r.g. bylaws, the general membership has e right at their discretion .
to call an election for new officers article 3, section 2.
that's true.
and the current officers are eager to hear all member concerns.
but first, i want to report on the status of the red, white, and blue home garden project, which some of you may not have heard of.
no one cares about plants that we have to pay for when we barely have enough money for food.
that's why i'm here-- get rid of those damn loan sharks.
Yeah, and tell us how the f. r.g. is going to give us short-term loans.
and what about more jobs on base for us wives?
why not do something about that?
well, spouse employment is handled by-- -it isn't just the loan sharks preying on us.
it might not matter to officers' wives
ladies. kathryn's trying to explain-- -i say let's vote.
I second the motion. -yeah.
if they have wheels, they could've already found an airfield.
in that case... the rockets are gone.
who here has seen a helicopter land in the last 12 hours?
I'll pay american money if you don't speak you get nothing -you. -untie me. i'm not a dog.
get up. help us.
no. -or you'll get a beating.
let me go back. they'll suspect me.
you'll go back when you tell me everything i need to know.
this conversation has no meaning if those men and those rockets have gone.
they have not gone. -you sure?
I know where they're going.
show me. -no. no!
then tell me.
take me to america.
all right.
swear it?
I swear i will take you to america when we're done with this.
the mehave a helicopter close by.
face me.
I'm gonna pull my arm back as if i'm gonna hit you.
when i bring my arm forward... you scream and drop.
untie them. untie them all. they're useless.
Colonel. you're up early.
I heard you got yourself electeto another job.
one i refuse to accept.
did kathryn pratt mention that when she called to complain?
Kathryn didn't place the call. general pratt did that all by himself.
the missus was whisperin' in his ear in the background.
this is the third time i've been alerted to kim brown.
she's a runaway pony.
you put a snaffle bit on her before she brings the whole thing down.
she didn't mean to. -general pratt is helpin' run a war.
he doesn't have time to go after the likes of lucky larry.
his wife's all over his ass about loan sharks preyin' on the wives.
is she?
kim's got her all fired up about spouses gettin' husbands' checks late and needin' credit at the commissary and some other businesses.
Kathryn pratt's fired up? -put a lid on this, molly.
sorry, colonel. this one may have gotten over my head.
I'll take a rain check.
that way. there.
they're gonna take off, boss.
well...can you hit it?
Oh, i believe so.
do it.
I got a lock.
Yeah, that's ok. it's over now.
Miami. i wanna live in miami.
I saw a show about brazilians that moved to miami.
is it as pretty as it looks?
it doesn't have to be miami. new york. chicago.
you swore to me! you liar! why are you such a liar?! why?!
I hate you! i hate you! i hate you!
you swore to me! you swore to me! you swore to me!
liar! liar! liar! liar!
I'm sorry. i can't do it.
no, no, no, no, no, honey. you want them in stripes, red and white stripes.
you don't think it'd look better all mixed up?
well, i think it'd be more like the flag.
don't you think, molly? -i don't know. what's goin' on?
punishing kim's insubordination by helping her plant these.
Kathryn brought me these flowers.
even though it should've been me thanking her.
you agreed to stay on as president?
well, acting president. until there can be a proper election.
once word gets around about lucky larry's run-in with the fire marshal, i'm bettin' kat'll be a shoo-in.
kat"? -i'm the one in debt.
kim really shook us up, didn't she, molly? -she did, indeed.
I said...i said, "no, kathryn, the worst thing that a racist can call an african american that starts with n and ends with r is neighbor.
you get it?
a friend of mine gave me tickets. 50 yard line.
would you like to join me, son? -yes, sir. thank you. i would.
how'd that job of yours end up goin'?
the one that took you away from here so quick your last visit?
gone fine.
we...we all do our part.
what's goin' on?
that's what i'm asking you, hector.
my father doesn't just change on a dime like that unless the's a reason.
way he's acting, you're... nelson mandela here to say grace.
you want to tell me why?
it's complicated.
this truth isn't complicated. why are you making it complicated?
Hector. why don't you come inside with me and have a brandy.
daddy, i'm talking to hector. -talkin' him to death is more like it.
then do you want to tell me what's happening?
young lady, you don't know who this man is.
laurenda.
there's some people i'd like you to meet.
who are these people? and would someone tell me what's going on right now?
I knew that that girl had sense.
is that what she has, now? -in this instance, yes. yes, she has.
special forces? first of all...
you misrepresented yourself. -laurenda...
and--and--and i know you would say it's for reasons of security.
the way i see it, call it a fib or a lie, i don't like it.
and second--wait a second
secondly, the man i thought i was falling for was in some non-mbatant specialty he called "logistics.
and--and fool that i was, i saw some profession after the army.
you tell me what--what--what employment there is...
laurenda... -well, that's the end of this conversation.
it's been instructive knowing you.
daddy...u show this boy out.
what am i supposed to do now? -you could try begging.
begging for what? -well, for understanding.
nothing to understand.
she's got her life, and she don't want mine.
that flight attendant call you?
Yeah. wants to know if i think you like him.
boss.
how's a unit man know when his girl's the right one?
well...like they say. see her side of the argument.
argument's over. -no, it's not. no. it's not.
what's her hidden fear? all right?
children.
her--she may not even know it herself...
but her concern is children-- the lives of the children.
and to her credit, there is-- there's no higher concern.
would you let a man...drink in peace?
would you let me...drink in peace?
are you all right? - l'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear!
that was wonderful!
you know...
...we were wondering why you couldn't come with us to ask the Wizard for a heart.
suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one when we got there.
Oh, but he will!
he must!
we've come such a long way already.
you call that long?
why, you've just begun!
helping the little lady along, are you, my fine gentlemen?
well, stay away from her...
...or l'll stuff a mattress with you!
and you!
l'll use you for a beehive!
here, scarecrow! Want to play ball?
fire! l'm burning! l'm burning!
l'm not afraid of her.
l'll see you get safely to the Wizard, whether l get a brain or not!
stuff a mattress with me!
l'll see you reach the Wizard, whether l get a heart or not.
beehive! Bah!
let her try and make a beehive out of me!
you're the best friends anybody ever had.
and it's funny, but l feel as if l've known you all the time.
but l couldn't have, could l? - l don't see how.
you weren't around when l was stuffed and sewn together.
and l was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
still, l wish l could remember.
but l guess it doesn't matter anyway.
we know each other now.
that's right. - We do.
to Oz? -To Oz!
we're Off to See the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz
we hear he is a whiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was
if ever, oh ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because

because of the wonderful things he does
we're Off to See the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz l don't like this forest.
lt's dark and creepy!
of course, l don't know...
...but l think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
we might.
animals that eat straw?
some, but mostly lions and tigers and bears.
lions! -And tigers?
and bears!
lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my!
lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my!
lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my!
put 'em up! Put 'em up!
which one of you first?
l'll fight you both together, if you want.
l'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back!
l'll fight you on one foot!
l'll fight you with my eyes closed!
pulling an ax on me, eh?
sneaking up on me, eh? Why...
go away and let us alone. -Oh, scared, huh?
afraid, huh?
how long can you stay fresh in that can?
come on, get up and fight, you shivering junkyard.
put your hands up, you lopsided bag of hay!
that's getting personal, Lion.
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.
what's wrong with your teaching him?
well, l hardly know him.
l'll get you anyway, peewee!
shame on you!
what did you do that for? l didn't bite him.
no, but you tried to.
lt's bad enough picking on a straw man, but picking on little dogs...
well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?
ls my nose bleeding?
well, of course not.
my goodness, what a fuss you're making!
naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are...
you're nothing but a big coward!
you're right, l am a coward!
l haven't any courage at all.
l even scare myself!
look at the circles under my eyes.
l haven't slept in weeks.
why don't you try counting sheep?
that doesn't do any good. l'm afraid of them.
Oh, that's too bad.
you think the Wizard could help him too?
l don't see why not.
come along with us.
we're on our way to see the Wizard. To get him a heart.
and him a brain. -He could give you some courage.
wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion?
l would.
no, of course not.
gee, that's awfully nice of you.
my life has been simply unbearable.
well, it's all right now.
the Wizard'll fix everything.
lt's been in me so long.
l just gotta tell you how l feel.
come on!
Yeah, it's sad, believe me, missy When you're born to be a sissy
without the vim and verve
but I could show my prowess. Be a lion, not a mouse
if I only had the nerve
I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dandy lion
a fate I don't deserve -I'd be brave as a blizzard -I'd be gentle as a lizard
I'd be clever as a gizzard
if the Wizard is a wizard who will serve
then I'm sure to get a brain -A heart -A home
the nerve!
we're Off to See the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz
we hear he is a whiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was

long live the king!
if I Were King of the Forest
not queen
not duke
not prince
my regal robes of the forest
would be satin
not cotton
not chintz
I'd command each thing. Be it fish or fowl
with a woof!
and a woof!
and a royal growl
as I'd click my heel All the trees would kneel
and the mountains bow And the bulls kowtow
and the sparrow would take wing
if I
if I were king
each rabbit would show respect to me
the chipmunks genuflect to me
though my tail would lash
I would show compash
for every underling
if I
if I were king
just king
monarch of all I survey
monarch
of all I survey lf you were king, you wouldn't be afraid of anything?
not nobody, not nohow!
not even a rhinoceros? -lmposserous!
how about a hippopotamus? -l'd trash him from top to "bottom-us.
supposing you met an elephant? -l'd wrap him up in "cello-phant" !
what if it were a brontosaurus? -l'd show him who's king of the forest!
how? -How?
courage!
what makes a king out of a slave? Courage!
what makes the flag on the mast to wave? Courage!
what makes the elephant charge his tusk...
...in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?
what makes the muskrat guard his musk? Courage!
what makes the sphinx the Seventh Wonder? Courage!
what makes the dawn come up like thunder?
courage!
what makes the Hottentot so hot?
what puts the "ape" in apricot?
what have they got that l ain't got?
courage! -You can say that again.
the Wizard says go away!
go away?
looks like we came a long way for nothing.
and l was so happy.
l thought l was on my way home.
don't cry. We're gonna get you to the Wizard.
we certainly are.
auntie Em was so good to me...
...and l never appreciated it.
running away and hurting her feelings.
professor Marvel said she was sick.
she may be dying...and it's all my fault.
l'll never forgive myself.
never, never, never.
please don't cry anymore.
l'll get you into the Wizard somehow.
come on. l had an Aunt Em myself once.
wait a minute, fellas.
l was just thinking, l don't want to see the Wizard this much.
l better wait for you outside.
what's the matter? -He's just scared again.
don't you know the Wizard will give you courage?
l'd be too scared to ask him for it.
well, then, we'll ask him for you.
l'd sooner wait outside.
Why? Why?
because l'm still scared!
what happened? -Somebody pulled my tail.
you did it yourself.
here.
come on.
come forward!
tell me when it's over!
look at that. Look at that!
l wanna go home!
l am Oz...
...the Great and Powerful!
who are you?
who are you?
lf you please...
...l am Dorothy...
...the small and meek.
we've come to ask you
Silence!
Oh! Jiminy crickets!
the Great and Powerful Oz...knows why you have come.
step forward...
...Tin Man!
you dare to come to me for a heart, do you?
you clinking, clanking, clattering...collection of caliginous junk!
Yes, sir.
Yes, Your Honor.
you see...
...a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road
quiet!
and you, Scarecrow...
...have the effrontery to ask for a brain...
...you billowing bale of bovine fodder!
Yes, Your Honor. l mean, Your Excellency.
l mean, Your Wizardry!
enough!
and you, Lion!
well?
you ought to be ashamed of yourself...
...frightening him like that when he came to you for help!
silence...
...whippersnapper!
the beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests.
what's that? What'd he say?
What'd he say?
but first, you must prove yourselves worthy...
...By performing a very small task.
bring me the broomstick of the Witch of the West.
but if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it.
bring me her broomstick...
...and l'll grant your requests.
now go!
but what if she kills us first?
l said go!
l'd turn back if l were you.
l believe there's spooks around here.
that's ridiculous!
Spooks! That's silly.
don't you believe in spooks?
no. Why, only
are you all right?
l do believe in spooks.
l do, l do, l do, l do.
l do believe in spooks. l do, l do, l do, l do, l do!
you'll believe in more than that before l'm finished with you.
take your army and bring me that girl and her dog.
do what you like with the others, but l want her alive.
they'll give you no trouble. l promise you that.
l've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.
take special care of those slippers. l want those most of all.
now, fly! Fly!
bring me that girl and her slippers!
help! Help!
go away now!
Toto! Toto! Help!
help! Help! Help!
what happened to you?
they tore my legs off and threw them over there!
then they took my chest and threw it over there!
that's you all over.
they sure knocked the stuffings out of you.
don't stand there. Put me together. We've got to find Dorothy!
now, let's see...
what a nice little dog.
and you, my dear.
what an unexpected pleasure.
lt's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.
what are you gonna do with my dog? Give him back!
all in good time, my little pretty.
all in good time.
please give me back my dog.
certainly, certainly...
...when you give me those slippers.
but the Good Witch told me not to.
very well.
throw that basket in the river.
No! You can have your old slippers, but give me back Toto!
that's a good little girl.
l knew you'd see reason!
l'm sorry! l didn't do it. Can l still have my dog?
No! Fool that l am, l should have remembered...
...those slippers will never come off...
...as long as you're alive.
but that's not what's worrying me. lt's how to do it.
these things must be done delicately...
...or you hurt the spell.
run, Toto, run! -Catch him, you fool!
run, Toto, run!
he got away! He got away!
which is more than you will!
Drat, you and your dog!
you've been more trouble to me than you're worth.
but it'll soon be over now!
do you see that?
that's how much longer you've got to be alive.
and it isn't long, my pretty. lt isn't long!
l can't wait forever to get those shoes!
l'm frightened.
l'm frightened, Auntie Em! l'm frightened.
where are you?
lt's me. lt's Auntie Em.
we're trying to find you. Where are you?
l'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.
l'm locked up in the Witch's castle...
...and l'm trying to get home to you, Auntie Em!
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!
l'm frightened!
come back! Come back!
auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!
l'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!
look! There's Toto!
Where'd he come from?
why, don't you see?
he's come to take us to Dorothy.
come on, fellas!
l hope my strength holds out.
l hope your tail holds out.
what's that?
that's the castle of the Wicked Witch!
Dorothy's in that awful place? -l hate to think of her in there.
we've got to get her out. -Don't cry now.
we haven't got the oilcan, and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
who's them? Who's them?
l've got a plan how to get in there. -Fine. He's got a plan.
and you're gonna lead us. -Yeah.
me? -Yes, you.
l gotta get her out of there? -That's right.
all right, l'll go in there for Dorothy.
wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...
...guards or no guards, l'll tear them apart.
l may not come out alive, but l'm going in there.
there's only one thing l want you to do. -What's that?
talk me out of it.
no, you don't! -Oh, no.
now, wait a minute. -Up!
come on, l've got another idea.
do you think it would be polite, dropping in like this?
where do we go now?
there!
wait! We better make sure. Dorothy, are you in there?
lt's us!
Yes!
lt's me! She's locked me in!
we gotta get her out! Open the door!
Oh, hurry! Please hurry!
the hourglass is almost empty!
stand back!
l knew you'd come! l knew you would!
hurry, we've got no time to lose!
going so soon?
l wouldn't hear of it.
why, my little party's just beginning.
trapped. Trapped like mice...rats!
that's right. Don't hurt them right away.
we'll let them think about it a little first.
seize them! Seize them!
stop them, you fools!
seize them! Seize them!
there they go! Now we've got them!
half you go this way, half you go that way.
Hurry! Hurry!
where do we go now?
this way. Come on!
back! Back!
well!
Ring-around the rosie, a pocket full of spears!
thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you?
the last to go will see the first three go before her.
and her mangy little dog too!
how about a little fire, Scarecrow?
help! l'm burning! l'm burning! lt's burning!
don't touch that water!
you cursed brat! Look what you've done!
l'm melting! Melting!
what a world! What a world!
who would've thought a good little girl like you...
...could destroy my beautiful wickedness?
look out! Look out!
l'm going.
she's dead. You've killed her.
l didn't mean to kill her.
really, l didn't.
lt's just that he was on fire.
hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
the Wicked Witch is dead!
the broom.
may we have it? -Please. And take it with you.
thank you so much!
now we can go tell the Wizard the Wicked Witch is dead!
the Wicked Witch is dead!
can l believe my eyes?
why have you come back?
please, sir. We've done what you told us.
we've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch.
we melted her.
you liquidated her, eh? Very resourceful.
Yes, sir.
so we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please.
not so fast. Not so fast!
l'll have to give the matter a little thought.
go away and come back tomorrow.
tomorrow?
but l want to go home now!
you've had plenty of time already.
do not arouse the wrath of the Great and Powerful Oz!
l said come back tomorrow!
lf you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises.
do you presume to criticize the Great Oz?
you ungrateful creatures!
think yourselves lucky that l'm giving you audience tomorrow...
...instead of 20 years from now!
the Great Oz has spoken!
pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.
the Great Oz has spoken.
who are you?
well, l am the Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz.
you are?
l don't believe you!
l'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
you humbug!
Yes, that's exactly so. l'm a humbug.
you're a very bad man!
no, my dear. l'm a very good man.
l'm just a very bad wizard.
what about the heart you promised Tin Man?
and the courage you promised Cowardly Lion?
and Scarecrow's brain?
why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity.
every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth...
...or slinks through slimy seas has a brain.
back where l come from, we have universities...
...seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers.
they think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have.
but they have one thing you haven't got. A diploma.
therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me...
...By the Universitatus Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum...
...l hereby confer upon you...
...the honorary degree of Th. D.
th. D?
that's Doctor of Thinkology.
the sum of the square roots of two sides of an isosceles triangle...
...is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
Oh, joy! Rapture!
l've got a brain!
how can l thank you enough?
well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend...
...you're a victim of disorganized thinking.
you are under the delusion that because you run away from danger...
...you have no courage. You're confusing courage with wisdom.
back where l come from, we have men who are called "heroes.
once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs...
...and parade it down the main street.
and they have no more courage than you have.
but they have one thing that you haven't got. A medal.
therefore...
...for meritorious conduct, extraordinary valor...
...conspicuous bravery against wicked witches...
...l award you the Triple Cross.
you are now a member of the Legion of Courage.
shucks, folks, l'm speechless.
as for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart.
you don't know how lucky you are not to have one.
hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.
but l still want one.
back where l come from, there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds.
they are called phil
Good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours.
but they have one thing you haven't got. A testimonial.
therefore, in consideration of your kindness...
...l take pleasure at this time in presenting you...
...with a small token of our esteem and affection.
and remember, my sentimental friend...
...that a heart is not judged by how much you love...
...but by how much you are loved by others.
lt ticks!
listen! Look, it ticks!
read what my medal says. "Courage.
ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth!
Oh, they're all wonderful.
Hey, what about Dorothy?
Yes, how about Dorothy?
Dorothy next.
l don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.
you force me into a cataclysmic decision.
the only way to get Dorothy to Kansas is for me to take her myself.
Oh, will you? Could you?
but are you clever enough to manage it?
child, you cut me to the quick!
l'm an old Kansas man myself...
...born and bred in the western wilderness...
...premier balloonist par excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.
until one day, while performing feats of stratospheric skill...
...never before attempted by civilized man...
...an unfortunate phenomena occurred.
the balloon failed to return to the fair.
lt did?
weren't you frightened?
you are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death...
...sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. l was petrified.
suddenly the wind changed...
...and the balloon floated down into this noble city...
...where l was instantly acclaimed Oz, the first wizard deluxe!
times being what they were, l accepted the job...
...retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick getaway.
and in that balloon, dear Dorothy...
...you and l will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum.
my friends. l mean, my friends!
this is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown...
...be that as it may.
l, your Wizard per ardua ad alta...
...am about to embark upon a hazardous...
...and technically unexplainable journey...
...into the outer stratosphere!
to confer, converse.....and otherwise hobnob with my brother wizards.
and l hereby decree that until what time...
...if any, that l return...
...the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains...
...shall rule in my stead...
...assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart...and the Lion, by virtue of his courage.
obey them as you would me.
thank you.
come back!
don't go without me. l'll be right back.
stop that dog!
this is a highly irregular procedure. This is absolutely unprecedented!
ruined my exit!
come back! Come back!
don't go without me! Please come back!
l can't come back! l don't know how it works!
goodbye, folks!
goodbye!
now l'll never get home.
stay with us then, Dorothy.
we all love you.
we don't want you to go.
that's very kind of you...
...but this could never be like Kansas.
auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.
Oh, Scarecrow, what am l going to do?
look!
here's someone who can help you!
will you help me? Can you help me?
you don't need help any longer.
you've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
l have?
why didn't you tell her before?
because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself.
what have you learned, Dorothy?
l think that it...
...that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.
and it's that if l ever go looking for my heart's desire again...
...l won't look any further than my own back yard...
...because if it isn't there...
...l never really lost it to begin with.
ls that right?
that's all it is.
but that's so easy! l should've thought of it for you.
l should've felt it in my heart.
she had to find it out for herself.
now those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds.
toto too? -Toto too.
now? -Whenever you wish.
Oh, dear.
that's too wonderful to be true!
lt's gonna be so hard to say goodbye.
l love you all too.
goodbye, Tin Man.
don't cry.
you'll rust so dreadfully.
here. Here's your oilcan.
goodbye.
now l know l've got a heart...
...because it's breaking.
goodbye, Lion.
l know it isn't right...
...but l'm gonna miss the way you used to holler for help...
...before you found your courage.
l would never have found it if it hadn't been for you.
l think l'll miss you most of all.
are you ready now?
say goodbye, Toto.
Yes, l'm ready now.
then close your eyes...
...and tap your heels together three times...
...and think to yourself...
..."There's no place like home.
there's no place like home.
there's no place like home.
there's no place like home.
wake up, honey.
Dorothy, dear. lt's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!
Yes, darling. -Hello there! Anybody home?
l dropped by because l heard the little girl got caught in the big tornado.
she seems all right now.
she got quite a bump.
we kind of thought she was gonna leave us.
but l did leave you. That's just the trouble.
and l tried to get back for days!
there, there, lie quiet now.
you just had a bad dream.
remember me...
...your old pal, Hunk?
and me...
...Hickory?
you couldn't forget my face, could you?
but it wasn't a dream.
lt was a place.
and you and you and you...
...and you were there.
but you couldn't have been, could you?
we dream lots of silly things when we
no, Aunt Em, this was a real, truly live place.
and l remember that some of it wasn't very nice...
...but most of it was beautiful.
but just the same, all l kept saying to everybody was, "l want to go home!
and they sent me home.
doesn't anybody believe me?
of course we believe you, Dorothy.
but anyway, Toto, we're home!
home!
and this is my room...
...and you're all here.
and l'm not going to leave here ever, ever again...
...because l love you all.
and oh, Auntie Em...
...there's no place like home!
dad? - yeah?
the water's green.
no, it's fluorescent.
what's... - fluorescent.
fluorescent means "lit from within.
so am I fluorescent?
Yeah, Dory, you are.
it's okay, honey.
why has grandma been sleeping all day?
well, she's sedated, sweetie.
I don't know what that word means, mom.
it means that she's been taking pills so she can sleep.
she lost her son, Harper.
there's nothing more painful in the whole wide world.
more than losing your dad?
different.
different.
cousin Laura's coming. - really? why?
I haven't spoken to her in over 10 years.
that's Brian's computer.
I can't go in there, so can you...
okay. okay. It's okay. I got it.
who is "snakes290"?
Oh, god.
he's an old college friend of Brian's that now lives in Michigan.
what does it say?
he said, "what do you think of the sonics' new power forward?"
well, what did he think of them?
he thought he was a good rebounder,
but his outside jumper needed some work.
then write that.
all right. I can do that.
shit!
what? what? what? - shit!
what's wrong, Audrey?
I forgot to tell somebody. - who?
Neal, can you take me down to Renton?
Renton? you can't call? - No, he doesn't have a phone.
who doesn't have a phone, sweetie?
can you take me? -No, honey! come on, now!
okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.
I can go.
look, right around here from...
there's his address book, and look up a Jerry Sunborne.
who's Jerry Sunborne, darling?
who the hell is Jerry Sunborne?
you want something to eat?
no, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I just couldn't...
do you have another one of those? - yeah
thank you.
I'm Howard Glassman.
I'm Jerry.
how did you know Brian?
we grew up together.
I just live down the street and financed some of his deals...
Oh, no. - I'm sorry.
well, I'm...
my wife.
it's nice to meet you, Jerry.
so you started smoking again?
come on! Get out of the way!
all right! I bet you I could jump over it!
I'm gonna jump over it!
you don't know?
I guess your brain's growing up too small.
Hey. - hello. hi.
Hi. I'm David.
my name is Jerry. You're Harper.
Yeah. - Hi.
Hi. - Dory.
your dad was my best friend.
when?
when I was your age, and last week.
strawberry Fields Forever is your favorite song.
and Dory's got that scar on his nose cause he was running and he thought the screen door was open.
cause he was running and he thought the screen door was open.
but it was closed.
everybody knows that, Dory.
you don't like mimes. They scare you.
they don't talk.
Yeah, that's what they do.
your suit is a little big.
thank you.
that was imprudent of you.
I bet you can't do this.
fast.
Hi. - hey, Jerry.
I'm so sorry.
thanks for coming.
I'm really glad you came.
I wasn't so sure you would actually come, - So, thank you. - No problem
I hated you.
I hated you for so many years, Jerry.
it's all right.
and now, it just all seems so silly.
he was so loyal to a fault, you know.
most people would've given up on you. Hell, I would've.
but he didn't.
I know.
I'm gonna go.
no, I... wait.
I need you to stay.
please, can you just stay for a little bit?
sure. - Just a little bit?
sure. Sure.
good.
so Brian is maybe six years old,
and we're the Andersons' guests at flathead country club,
and we're swimming in the pool,
and all of the sudden, Brian gets out of the water,
and he pulls his bathing suit down and he takes a piss right in the pool.
and people are just freaking out.
june Anderson is freaking out.
people are going, "what are you doing?"
I mean, he's peeing right in the pool like it's a urinal, so...
and when it was over I say, "Brian, why did you do that?"
you know, I mean, he wasn't a bad kid.
he never acted out. He's quiet, you know.
and I said... okay, I'm totally messing this story up!
I said, "why'd you...shut up!"
I said, "why did you do that?"
and he came back with something that made no sense.
shit. I forget what he said. It was so funny. Shoot.
he said he didn't want to get his bathing suit wet.
Yes! That was it!
I didn't want... I didn't want to get my bathing suit wet!
that's okay!
he was a little retarded as a kid, you know.
no, I'm sorry, but he was. He was... He was slow, you know.
and, you know, he came around eventually.
we home?
don't let them grow up.
how about I make us some pasta? Open the wine.
that way our vacation won't have to end till tomorrow.
when I get back.
no. No, Brian... - I have to.
Why? - It's his birthday.
so?
Audrey, you didn't know him when he was a kid. He was special.
every time you leave here, Brian,
I'm scared to death you're not gonna come back.
Oh, Jesus, just stop being so damn dramatic.
you stop being so damn naive.
Audrey, it's his birthday.
who the hell knows how many more he's gonna have?
mom?
Hey, Jay. - Hey.
happy Birthday!
august 3rd. - August 3rd.
Yeah.
you're an old man. - Yeah.
come on in. Come on in.
she okay? - Yeah, she's fine. Have a seat.
I'm hungry. You want to get something to eat?
Yeah. Cool. - Yeah? Let's go out.
they got coffee, strawberry... - No coffee. Strawberry.
strawberry? - Yeah.
will you try and find some soup? - Okay.
so they're not happy with the work, you know?
I think I'm gonna fire the workers.
and Audrey's fucking someone else.
are you checking to see if I'm listening?
no, man. You don't understand.
this woman looks so good, there is no way that she is only fucking me.
our neighbor's this guy named Landon Hicks.
he's this rugged, mountain-man type guy.
big beard. Big hair. Doesn't even talk.
she's in love with Landon Hicks!
well, you gotta take the good with the bad.
what's the good?
are you still...
Yes, I am.
I mean, you're still in the rotation, you know what I'm saying?
you know, you gotta accept the good, man,
cause they're gonna make you accept the bad.
you have everything any man would want.
accept the good, Brian. You have what I'll never have.
Oh, come on, don't talk like that about yourself, all right?
Brian, you're my only real friend left in the world, you know that?
Audrey angry you came to see me tonight?
no.
Yes.
I don't know why you're so dead set against seeing her again.
well, I don't want to see anybody until I'm clean. That's why.
so, the fed raised rates. Is that gonna affect you?
no, people will still buy. This refi boom's got good legs.
good.
yeah?
Jerry?
maybe. Who is it?
I'm Audrey Burke's brother, Neal.
can you open the door, please?
Yeah.
Yeah.
yeah?
Brian is dead.
he was killed.
somebody killed him, and he's dead.
what the fuck are you talking about?
he's dead.
are you fucking with me?
some guy was beating up on his wife and Brian...
what?
Brian's dead.
the funeral is today.
I'm here to take you to the funeral.
you better not be fucking with me, man.
do you have a suit?
Yeah, I got a suit.
at this time, on behalf of the Burke family,
I'd like to thank those of you who have been able to spend this time with us.
many of you have traveled a long distance,
and it is much appreciated.
in a few moments, we'll be going to the Burke residence for the reception.
Hey, what about chicken, Harper? you can eat chicken, can't you?
chickens are animals, dad. I don't eat animals.
since when?
since meat is murder. - No more meat, honey.
dad? - Meat is murder.
dad? - Basically.
daddy? - Where did you learn this?
I know things. Not everything I know was learned.
well, actually, that's not true. - Dad!
the nature of knowledge is that you learned it somewhere.
dad! - Yes?
I like meat. - I know you do.
he likes meat, Harper.
and he's gonna get bigger than you.
she does eat broccoli.
I see. - Don't you, baby?
did you take 60 bucks out of the car, babe?
no.
that's funny, cause I had three $20s in the ashtray,
and now they're gone.
no. I didn't take it.
was your friend in the car the other night?
he didn't take it.
who? - He wouldn't take it.
who? Who wouldn't take it?
would you wake up, Brian? - Nobody.
wake up!
wake up! - All right.
mom, who? - Jesus.
meat is so murder! Get her! Get her!
get her. - Well, it is.
Yeah, come in.
Yeah, I know. I can't stay. I gotta take off.
Oh, okay.
well, it was very nice hanging out with you.
you know I appreciate it more than you know, man.
well... - Really.
happy Birthday, man. - Okay.
all right.
it's good to see you. - Take care.
Hey, don't forget the...
don't forget what?
groceries. - What?
Hey, pretty boy.
it's way past her bedtime.
Oh, no, you're not watching that lifetime movie again, are you?
it's this commercial we just saw.
you're crying over a commercial?
do you have any idea what they're doing to baby seals in alaska, honey?
they were so cute, dad.Please, give them a lot of money.
I wrote down the website.
we need to make a really big donation. - Okay. Okay, good.
Harper, out.
out.
good night, honey. - Good night, mom.
seal hater.
seal hater. Nice to meet you.
I'm gonna go wash up.
so how was he?
so how was he?
he's all fucked up, Audrey.
all fucked up.
you know, he said this thing to me, didn't strike me until I was driving home.
he asked me if the feds raising the rates would affect my business.
now, that has no relevance for Jerry in his world, right?
he would have read it somewhere and just remembered it.
because he knew it had relevance for me, you see?
and I know that you think I just go there.
and I give, and I give, and he just takes,
but, you know, he's my friend.
he looks out for me, you understand?
he's my friend.
okay.
you know, they forgot to put the dimmers on the lights.
I am gonna fire those guys, and I'm gonna go with the Polish guys.
you're taking the kids swimming at Howard's tomorrow.
all right. Dory's putting his head under.
go easy on him, baby. - Even if I have to push it.
well, that's nice.
I told Jerry you were fucking landon hicks.
you what?
Landon Hicks? - He knows I was joking.
why would I be fucking landon hicks? - I don't know.
if I was gonna sleep with somebody.
it sure as hell wouldn't be landon hicks.
no? Why not?
because he doesn't speak. That's why.
who would it be?
the water guy.
the water guy?
Why?
because.
why the water guy?
cause he reminds me of a cowboy.
the guy that brings the arrowhead water reminds you of a cowboy.
Oh, yeah.
shouldn't have asked if you didn't want to know.
come on. Do it.
okay, do it.
please do it.
come here.
that's it.
you guys need anything?
no, thanks, Howard. You gonna come in?
he doesn't swim. - Okay.
who spends $200, 000 on a swimming pool and doesn't swim?
all right, doris, that's enough.
maybe next time, you'll try building a mosque.
that's funny. we'll be back in a couple of hours.
what happened? - I don't feel like it.
he's just being difficult for the attention, dad.
thank you, Dr. Freud.
why don't you go touch the drain or something?
now, look, Dory, just try.
I already did! - No, you didn't.
now, look, you got to face your fears.
everybody has to in life, okay? Now, you're a man.
you're almost six years old. It's time. Now, let's do it.
I don't have to! You can't make me!
no, I can make you.
baby! You're kidding.
am I kidding? - Aren't you?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we were kidding, right? Why don't you go to mommy?
Yeah. - I'll go swim with your sister.
come on, baby. Come with mommy.
cause your daddy is a very abusive man.
Hey.
I put walnut stain on this thing. Totally fucked it up.
no, you didn't, I think it looks good.
you think I'm ever gonna get an honest answer out of you,
or are you just gonna love every single thing I do?
it's... you know, I think it's ugly.
thank you. - Yeah.
I steam it. I sand it. I stain it.
and after all of that, I only got one chance at the finish.
and if I screw that up, then the whole thing is messed up.
well, what do I know? Cause I'm just here to deliver the water.
dad!
I promised them cold stone.
dad!
to be continued.
okay?
to be continued.
don't move, all right? - I won't.
Hey, hey!
daddy, I want strawberry and vanilla.
okay. Strawberry and vanilla?
Yeah! And Dory wants chocolate, strawberry and vanilla.
what do you mean strawberry and vanilla?
and mom wants lemon.
lemon? All right. - Yeah.
I'll be back in a little while.
Bye! - Bye.
dory.
you look like a little puppy waiting for its owner.
Where's my ice cream?
excuse me. - Mom.
that's funny. He's not answering.
are you Mrs. Brian Burke?
you love me. You love me. -No.
damn it! you bitch! - No!
you don't love him, you love me! Do you hear me?
fuck! And you lied to me!
don't you ever say that to me again, do you hear me?
don't you ever say that to me! - Hey! Stop! Stop that!
that's my wife! That's my wife! - Stop! I Don't care.
you're hurting her! Just leave her alone!
you told me you were over him! - Stop!
stop! Back off!
God. - Just breathe and count to 10.
I'm breathing, man, all right?
count to 10 for me.
one, two, three, four... - Yeah, all right, man.
Yes, hi.
I need an ambulance to southwest vista and elm.
I got a woman here. She's beaten. She's badly beaten. It's domestic and...
No!
I've got two kids.
I've got a 10-year-old girl and a six-year-old little boy.
and they're in there waiting, for their daddy to come home with ice cream.
I'm so sorry.
what's going on?
Jerry?
Oh, I'm sorry.
he doesn't live here anymore.
okay, can you tell me where I can find him?
try the mckinley clinic.
okay, the mckinley clinic. okay.
Hey! - Hi.
what are you doing here?
I don't know. I just wanted to see how you were.
good to see you.
want some coffee? Water?
Yeah. - Come on.
so this is a methadone clinic?
Yeah.
you take methadone? - Not me.
I just help around the clinic and they give me a place to stay.
when was the last time you used?
sixteen days ago.
I tried to quit after the funeral, but I relapsed.
so how are the kids?
Harper's messing up in school.
and Dory is having nightmares where his daddy is the monster.
would you like some more? - No.
I'm gonna shove off.
stop it, Harper! - I'm not doing anything.
stop it, Harper!
mom! - Harper! Stop it!
you two are acting like little brats!
all I asked you to do this morning was to sit here and eat quietly.
but you can't even seem to do that, can you? Don't laugh, Dory!
okay! - It's not funny!
mom? Can I sleep with you?
Yeah, honey. Come on.
right here. There we go.
Oh, shit.
Hey! okay, look, here's the deal. - Hi.
we had a fire in our garage.
the good news, we started to rebuild it.
the bad news, never finished it.
so, right now, all it is, is a room with a bathroom.
you can't stay here, Jerry.
you're nuts.
Why?
because it's free.
I don't need your charity, Audrey.
who's offering you charity? I'm the one that needs the help here.
really, you know how high my mortgage is?
you can move in, get yourself situated,
and, eventually, you can get a job and you can pay me rent.
so how come Brian never mentioned you?
cause I'm a recovering heroin addict, maybe?
I hate my wife.
I mean, since we're sharing.
I hate everything about her.
and she is gonna be furious when she finds out I gave this shit to you.
okay.
Hey, Dory. - Hi.
you gonna give us a hand?
Hey, Dory.
you got it?
there we go. - Good job, good job. Good job.
yeah? Come in.

Really? I haven't been to California, but I hear it's really, really cool.
Yeah. - I've always wanted to go there.

that is so cool. - And it was so... yeah.
Hey.
Hey, Jerry!
yeah?
I used to run with Brian every...
I used to run with Brian every morning.
so you want to go for a run?
I mean, I'm smoking, Howard.
I'll wait.
Howard, I haven't ran since junior high school.
we'll just, you know, go for however long.
you know, down to the driveway, whatever.
we'll just go, you know?
I don't know if I can do it. - We'll just go slow.
that's it. That's it. Can't do it.
okay.
this was our route.
thought about changing it afterward,
but this is our route.
Audrey, I don't think she's facing reality, man.
is she gonna have to get a job?
who told you that?
no. Brian was a great developer.
he really thought outside the box, you know? Great at rehabbing space.
found opportunities where nobody else could. was just...
their house? paid off long ago.
no, Audrey'll never have to worry about money.
morning. - Hey.
can I have some water? - Yeah.
thank you.
why am I here?
I don't really know.
you know, it should've been you, Jerry.
why wasn't it you?
Sonics suck. - You suck.
it's a rebuilding year.

and I'd take you down on the court anytime.
Oh, yeah? go ahead.
one more time, one more time, one more time. Shoot it. Shoot it.
check.
come on, check.
do you ever feel like you're inside of a movie?
do I ever feel like I'm inside a movie?
no.
it's a sad movie.
it'll change, harp.
I promise.
promise. Give me a high-five.
okay.
the hook, the hook! You gotta do the hook.
do the hook. Do the hook.
and I'm...
I'm wondering if maybe you might be able to help me do something.
sure.
sleep.
I need to sleep. - Sure.
leave your shoes out here.
and shut the door.
okay.
come on.
okay. - I need to sleep.
I don't know about this. - No, trust me.
this used to work better than ambien.
okay.
bring this knee up, like that. Higher. Yeah, That's it.
turn off the light.
okay, now... now take your hand
and pull down on the earlobe.
just pull down. Yeah, just like that.
Yeah, but do it faster. harder.
Yeah.
like that? - That's it.
just keep doing that.
I'm still awake. You gotta keep going.
keep going, keep going. - Okay, okay, okay.
keep going.
just for today, my thoughts will be on my recovery.
living and enjoying life without the use of drugs.
just for today, I will have faith in someone in N. A.
who believes in me and wants to help me in my recovery.
just for today, through N. A.
I will try to get a better perspective on my life.
just for today, I will be unafraid.
my thoughts will be on my new associations,
people who are not using
and who have found a new way of life.
so long as I follow that way, I have nothing to fear.
is there anyone else that'd like to share?
okay. - Yeah?
Hi, my name is Jerry and I'm an addict.
Hi, Jerry. - Hi, Jerry.
I've been clean for 21 days.
I'm here because my friend died.
he wasn't a user.
I knew him since second grade,
and he was the only person who never, ever gave up on me.
he died a hero in this fucked-up, tragic way.
it killed me.
it really did.
Jerry? - Yeah?
Hey. - Kelly.
I liked your share tonight.
good. I like compliments. Thank you.
so 21 days, huh? - Yeah.
bouncing off the bottom. - That's right, yeah.
you should stay till the serenity prayer.
excuse me?
last week you left before prayer, it's disrespectful to leave before it.
disrespectful to who?
to your recovery.
well, my recovery thanks you.
are you married? - No.
do you have children?
do I have children? Two.
a six-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter.
well, I should probably go,
but I'll see you next week.
buckle up!
you hungry? You want me to make you a sandwich or...
no, no, I'm fine. You think I could use the computer?
Yeah. Sure.
Howard wants me to look into something.
okay. Come on, I'll show you.
it's in there.
I know I should... I think I need to clean it out or...
those shoes are looking good!
so, how does a lawyer become a heroin addict?
Really? - Yeah.
well, you start by doing coke, and then you move on to a little crystal meth,
you get paranoid, then you find heroin, and after that...
but you were a good lawyer, right?
who cares? Look at me.
come work for me.
I don't know the first thing about the mortgage business, Howard.
you know what a house is, right?
that's a good interview. You got the job.
here you go.
thank you.
and here's the living room. - Yeah.
as you can see, Doris gets her decorating tips from Uday Hussein.
she's gonna get all this, you know, the house and everything.
so you're gonna go for it? - Yeah.
but I'm not good at facing my fears.
I'm not strong like you.
strong like me?
look, you're gonna have to take this test,
the washington state mortgage brokers' exam,
but don't freak out. I'll coach you through it.
you sure? - Yeah.
good.
Hey. I brought your laundry.
Yeah. - Thank you.
you look good.
I mean, a lot better than you did when you got here.
thank you. Thirty-nine days.
what's heroin like?
you ever heard that expression, "being kissed by god"?
well, that's just at first.
all you do is you chase it.
you chase that initial feeling when you can never get it back.
you can get the escape when you do get high,
but never like the first few times.
I wanna escape.
Yeah.
I wanna know what it feels like to escape.
no, you wouldn't.
Yes, I would.
and I would chase that feeling all day.
I would chase it until I couldn't chase it anymore.
no, you wouldn't. - Yes, I would chase it.
no, you wouldn't.
you're too strong.
too engaged.
I'm sorry.
sorry about that.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
let's play, sucker!
don't let my head get wet.
you don't let your head under water? - No.
can you put your chin under water?
show me.
how about this ear?
and the other ear? - Yeah.
and the top of your head?
there, you just put your head under water.
your chin, the top of your head, both of your ears.
that's everything, man. How do you feel?
I don't know.
well, why don't you put it under and tell me?
you've already done it.
it's easy to do something you've already done, man.
wanna do it fast? - Yeah.
on three?
everything okay?
Yeah. Can I... - Yeah, come in. Yeah.
sit down.
sit down. Yeah.
what you did today broke my heart.
What'd I do?
you got Dory to put his head under the water.
just a cute trick, you know. - He's six.
harper put hers under when she was only three.
it was something that Brian tried and tried to get Dory to do, but he couldn't.
and that victory today of getting Dory's head to go under
was not supposed to be yours.
it wasn't meant for you to have that moment.
and for me, watching you was like this...
this...
I'm sorry.
Harper's missing.
the principal just called.
she's not in school now and she wasn't there yesterday, either.
she's been missing school for two days, but she was here last night.
I'm freaking out, Jerry. She's not answering her cell phone.
I saw her get on the school bus this morning, okay?
well, you stay here in case she comes back because I'm going to the school.
......Life without you.
and you know I'm not afraid to die.
that's between you and yourself, Norma.
you think I made that up about the gun, don't you?
Harper!
call your mommy right now and tell her you're fine.
Yeah, it's almost over.
call her right now! Right now, young girl!
how'd you know where to find me?
your dad told me.
you know,
you could marry my mom and then she'd be happy again,
and we could be a family.
that could never happen, Harp.
why not?
because that would make it so my best friend never existed.
but...
he did exist.
I guess that's why.
and it doesn't matter because I could never fill his shoes, you know?
you know what? I passed the test, though.
Really? - Yep.
good job. - Thank you.
well, go ahead and tell her.
you tell her.
well, there is a week every year.
that the park theater plays a different black-and-white movie every day,
and Brian used to take off work and pull Harper out of school,
and they'd both play hooky together.
and see one of these black-and-white movies,
so that's where I found baby hitchcock over here.
how'd you know about the movies?
Brian told me.
so how the fuck did you know about it and I didn't?
I don't know.
maybe he knew if you did, you wouldn't let him do it again.
just don't take it out on her, okay?
it's not her fault.
what's wrong?
this isn't working, Jerry.
those are my kids,
and I don't need you or anybody else telling me how to raise them.
I know that.
you need to get your stuff and you need to go.
go.
Audrey.
Audrey.
Audrey.
Audrey.
Audrey, Audrey, stop.
this is unfair.
not to me, to Harper and Dory.
Yeah, you're being selfish.
fuck you!
thank you, Michael. - Thank you, Michael.
anyone else? Okay, who's next?
Kelly.
Hi, my name's Kelly and I'm an addict.
Hi, Kelly. - Hi, Kelly.
so I'm really mad today and frustrated
because there's this woman at the convalescent home I work at,
her name's Catherine. She's 96 years old.
she's always been this really upbeat, high-energy, optimistic...
big smile all the time, and she was recently diagnosed with cancer.
but it's the kind that spreads slowly, you know, it takes about 20 years.
and I didn't want them to tell her. You know, what's the point, right?
she's gonna die of old age. She's not gonna die of cancer.
they fucking told her!
and now she knows, she's in her bed all day,
she sleeps, she cries. it's...
I just... I don't think that they should've told her.
I'll be back.
Thanks, Kelly. - Thanks, Kelly.
now, for those who wish, please let's join in the serenity prayer.
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.
are you gonna sell those to buy drugs?
excuse me?
are you gonna sell it to buy drugs?
why aren't you in bed?
I had a nightmare.
well, me, too.
don't steal those. Put them back. It's bad.
put them back.
put them back.
okay.
it's not good. - Okay.
okay.
so what's your nightmare about?
I woke up,
went into my mom's bedroom.
she wasn't there. She was gone.
I came down here to check where she was.
then I woke up.
you know, the good thing is that it's... it's just a dream.
it's not real.
she usually sits with me until I fall back asleep.
I look at each game, each day, as a new chance.
Jerry! Let's play, sucker!
Jerry's gone! He's moved out!
he's gonna go do drugs again.
he's not gonna go do drugs, honey. Why would you think that?
is it because of me?
because I skipped school to go see those old movies?
I promise, I promise, I'll never do it again!
just let Jerry come back!
honey, nothing you did made Jerry leave, okay?
he's gonna be back, you'll see. And he's gonna be fine.
he's a big guy.
trust me on this one. Come on, give me the ball.
does that mean Jerry's gonna die now?
congratulations on two years of being clean.
thank you.
my name is Frances and I'm an addict.
Hi, Frances.
coming here for two years now
has made me believe that this is possible.
my mother gave me this bear when I was five years old,
and I plan to pass this bear on to my daughter when she's five.
you're gonna make it, girl.
thank you.
Jerry?
who is this?
who's this?
my name's Kelly.
is this where Jerry lives?
Yeah. - Is he there?
cause he wasn't at the N. A. meeting.
it was Fran's birthday,
and this wasn't a meeting that he would've missed.
what does that mean?
he's relapsed.
do you have any idea where he might be?
you don't wanna go there.
Hey, baby!
Jerry?
Jerry?
Jerry! Jerry! It's Audrey.
Hi, Audrey. - It's Audrey. Get up.
I'm taking you home. Come on! Get up! Get up!
come on.
come on.
you see what's left?
shut up, Jerry.
what can I get for you, Jerry,
right now, that's gonna help you feel better?
chocolate.
chocolate.
come on. Jerry.
it's fucked up. It's fucked up.
it's fucked up. - Sit down, Jerry. Sit down. Yeah.
Jerry?
what else do you need?
you know what? I would like some ice cream, please.
okay, I'll get you some ice cream,
but for right now, Neal is gonna stay here with you, okay?
okay?
Hi, Neal. - Hey, Jerry.
looks like we're gonna be roommates for a while, all right?
fine with me, but don't...
Hey, Jerry?
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
too much sleep.
well, we're gonna get you cleaned up.
get you out of those clothes.
I hate it, man. I hate it.
you got any more drugs on you?
I don't. Oh, no.
any needles?
okay, get that off.
we're gonna put that...
Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hey, you just got here. Go ahead, sit down.
who's with him?
my brother. Thanks for telling me about him.
are you his girlfriend?
no. No.
he was my husband's best friend.
the one who was shot?
was he the love of your life?
I lost the love of my life, too.
to an overdose.
but it's what got me clean.
you know, they say that every time a user dies,
there's one that gets clean because of it.
how long ago?
2, 653 days.
does it get better?
it gets different.
I have a new life,
so now I can have a new love of my life.
well, I don't know anything about addiction, kelly,
so would you like to help me?
come on, come on, come on.
come on. come on, come on.
come on. come on. come on.
you gotta breathe. You gotta breathe, baby.
it's me, it's me. It's okay. You gotta breathe.
I got you.
it's okay.
okay, okay. Nice and easy.
I feel like shit.
so the antacid you can give him now.
the tea is to help him keep down solids,
and you want to give him the antihistamine really only at night.
okay. No, no, no, that's for Jerry. - Nice.
do you want a little taste?
when can I see him?
very soon, honey. Promise.
all right. Come on, right here, man.
take this. take this. it's gonna help you out.
all right, get it down, get it down.
a little water. All right.
I'm cold!
are you gonna die like my dad?
Yeah.
when?
as soon as possible, I hope.
you're kidding, right?
I brought you some cookies and water.
C-3PO and r2-d2.
Yeah.
3po was a little stuck-up.
Yeah.
I like r2-d2 better.
excuse me.
he seemed more accessible.
here.
here! Get back.
Hey, Jerry.
Hi, Audrey. - Ready, Emily?
come on in.
I'm just... I'm smoking.
well, it's okay, you can smoke inside.
okay.
so he does not pay, right?
so, essentially, we are...
Hi, Diane. - Hi!
Hi.
how you doing? - Feeling better.
good. you look better.
Thanks.
he's so wrong.
what?
r2-d2 is more accessible?
so it wasn't a hallucination, huh?
no. That was my son.
he was so cute. Brought me a cookie and water.
hold on, excuse me.
dory! what did your mother say?
what did your mother say? what did your mother say?
you wanna sit and have some dinner?
I think you should eat, you know? Maybe you can keep it down.
I'll try.
see how he's spinning around like that?
Brian used to do the same thing.
basketball games, soccer games, any game.
I know.
I miss the silliness,
the fun.
I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel happy again.
am I ever gonna feel beautiful?
you are beautiful.
no, I mean on the inside.
you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Hey. - Hey.
what are you doing here?
I invited her.
Howard? - Yeah?
can we swim in the pool tomorrow?
I'm sorry, Dory, but I don't live there anymore.
Why?
well, because my soon to be ex-wife is gonna get the house.
honey, we'll find another place to swim. Okay?
what kind of music did your husband like?
did he like classical music?
Yeah.
what did he drink after dinner?
coffee? Italian wine? Or nothing?
chocolate milk. He loved chocolate milk.
what kind of toothpaste did he use? - Crest.
he... Crest.
come on, ask me a question, Kelly.
okay, what was his favorite movie?
I can't remember.
he liked this really old boring one, with the guy from meet the fockers.
godfather ii.
it was one, actually. - Yeah.
no, he liked two.
my dad shot a squirrel.
