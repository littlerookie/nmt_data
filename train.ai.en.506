the bailout authority was due to be discussed at a summit of eu leaders last night, which followed 24 hours of uncharacteristically rapid decision making by eurozone ministers.
the bailout bill is a classic example of expediency over effectiveness.
the bailout conditions for spain's banks would force any lender taking aid fully to write off its preferred shares and subordinated bonds, according to a draft memorandum of understanding seen by the financial times.
the bailout goes down in three days. All right then.
the bailout inspectors are scheduled to deliver a report on greece in late september or early october that assesses how far off track it is, and what can be done.
the bailout loans will be funnelled through the government's books, potentially adding up to 20 per cent to spain's sovereign debt, which could spook financial markets.
the bailout of the suddenly unlucky irish, and the arrival of the international monetary fund to administer their patented brand of financial emetic, needn't be as bad news for the markets are some might assume.
the bailout originally required greece to raise 50 billion euros by selling of state-owned assets.
the bailout plan for the us auto industry backed by the united auto workers is conditional on a savage restructuring of the industry that will result in plant closures, layoffs and the systematic lowering of wages.
the bailout will be channelled through the state-backed bank bailout fund, the frob (fund for orderly bank restructuring), and so will count as sovereign debt.
