governmental regulations and civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits, - Yeah, but he lost his finger, - We don't give a fuck!
that fool could blow his goddamn dick off, it don't make no nevermind to us!
we not payin' this jackass for goin' around blowin' off goddamn body parts!
get yo' fuckin' head out yo' ass, man!
look you, there is no call for,
no extra share!
OK, majority rules,
like I say, it was just a trial balloon, Hand's not so bad really,
I even get some phantom feeling,
Yeah, you pull on your prick, you get some phantom feelin', - Fuck you, - Fuck you, - Fuck you! - Fuck you, nubbie!
well, now that that matter is settled, why don't we synchronize our watches before Gawain reports to work,
in 20 seconds, it will be exactly 1 2: 1 6, - Fifteen, - What, it'll be 1 2: 1 5?
no, 1 5 seconds, Well, 1 1 seconds now, lt'll be 1 2: 1 6, - Eight, seven, - Professor? Prof,?

Ain'tthatsomethin'!
l, B,S, - You be what?
irritable Bowel Syndrome! Is there a men's room down here?
Oh, come on, you shouldn't be usin' the men's room now!
or a lady's room, quickly, l, B,S,
if you knew you had the runs, why didn't you shit back at the house?
quickly!
we don't want Elron finding your stinkin' ass on the crapper!
no choice, It's a medical condition, quickly!
you one disgustin' individual, you know that?
come on, follow me,
I feel 30 pounds lighter, - Come the fuck on with your stinkass, - Thank you for being so understanding,
not everyone is, of course, which is why the biggest challenge of l, B,S, is educating the public,
afflicts over two million people, yet most of us have never heard of it,
and it strikes without regard to age, gender or race,
Oh, fuck, man, I don't wanna hear about this shit,
well, that's exactly the kind of attitude we're fighting,
I guess I never told you that's how Mountain Girl and I met,
they had an l, B,S, weekend at Grossinger's up in the Catskills,
of course, the tourist business there has suffered with the demise of the Borscht Belt, so they have various promotions, mixers, so on,
this was a weekend for lrritable Bowel singles to meet and support each other - and share stories, - Man, look here,
I don't want to hear a single one of them stories, OK?
now, some of them are very moving, - Not one fucking story!
look, I didn't choose to have l, B,S, - Man, shut the fuck up!
there's no cure, you know, only control, lifelong condition,
Yeah, you know what? Bein' an asshole's a lifelong condition, too,
just drop the fuckin' tools,
I'm not complaining, I did meet Mountain Girl,
man, get back in the fuckin' hole!
Oh! Marvel, marvelous, marv, this way! This way, gentlemen!
Oh! Excellent! Excellent, Flawless, flawless, thumbs up,
can't stop shittin', Can't stop talkin' about shittin',
gentlemen, to we few, we who have shared each other's company, each other's cares, each other's joys, and who shall now reap the fruits of our communal efforts, shoulder to shoulder, from each according to his abilities, so forth and whatnot,
we have had our little differences along the way, but I'd like to think that they've only made us value one another all the more,
each of us coming to understand and appreciate the other's unique qualities and potencies and, yes, foibles,
I suggest that we shall look back upon this little caper one day, one distant day, grandchildren dandled upon our knee, and perhaps a tear will form and we shall say, "Well, with wit and grit and no small amount of courage, we accomplished something on that day, a feat of derring-do, an enterprise not ignoble,
we merry band, unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck,
we happy few, - Gentlemen, to us! - To us!
charge shoulda gone off already,
I do beg your pardon?
the charge to collapse the tunnel, I set it for eight minutes,
well, that much time and more has certainly elapsed,
I need not remind you, it is of the essence of this plan that the money should appear to have simply vanished without a trace, - spirited away, as it were, by ghosts, - Of course,
the conundrum of the undisturbed, yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance, not only to make our caper more intellectually satisfying, it is exigent as a matter of practical fact,
I remind you that if any tunnel is ever found leading to this house, the owner knows all your names,
you just fart?
Nope, nope, I'm fine, Perfectly all right! Not a problem!
there's no hole left,
professor!
I'm surprised!
well, uh, properly speaking, madam, we are surprised, You are taken aback,
though I do acknowledge that the sense that you intend is gaining increasing currency through its use, yes,
you have returned from your devotions betimes,
I had to make tea,
I want to talk to you, Professor, so don't you be leavin'!
and you! I told you I don't want any smokin' in this house!
Oh, come on in!
how you doin'?
tea, ladies,
now, I don't know what you boys been up to, but I know mischief when I see it, Now, I want an explanation, but first,
I want you to get your fannies up here with all y'all's period instruments,
now, I been tellin' the ladies about your music, and they want to hear you play, - Professor? - Yes, Lump?
I can't really play the buttsack,
madam, or rather, mesdames, you must accept our apologies for not bein' able to perform, for, as you see, we are shorthanded,
gawain is still at work, and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg,
perhaps I could offer, as a poor but ready substitute, a brief poetic recital,
though I do not pretend to any great oratorical skills,
I would be happy to present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe, "Ladies, thy beauty is to me"
like those Nicean barks of yore,
that gently, o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
to his own native shore,
- My, my, my, "On desperate seas long wont to roam,
thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
thy Naiad airs have brought me home
to the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome,
glory hallelujah, Amen!
Bye-bye, ladies, It was, it was my pleasure, - We have to do this again, - Yes, we do got to,
such a pleasure, Safe home, Safe home, - Now I want to know what's goin' on, - Oh, indeed, indeed,
the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing,
though I do believe that when you hear the explanation you shall laugh riotously, slappin' your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern,
lump here is an avid collector of lndian arrowheads, and having found one simply lying on your cellar floor
a particularly rare artifact of the Natchez tribe?
Nats, what?
he enlisted the entire ensemble in an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others,
and apparently, in doing so, we hit a mother lode of natural gas,
I myself became acutely aware of the smell of "rotten eggs,"
and itwasjustatthis inopportune moment that the General here violated the cardinal rule of this house - and lit himself a cigarette, - So sorry,
well, what about all that money?
Ah.
the money, Well, the money is Mr, Pancake's, - That's right, - Who only just remortgaged his home in order to raise the money for a surgical procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common-law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astigmia, strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly,
Mr, Pancake is an ardent foe of the Federal Reserve, and is, in fact, one of those eccentrics one often reads about hoardin' his entire life savings, in Mr, Pancake 's case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion, - The Steel Sak, - Don't trust the banks, Never have,
Mm-mn,
it don't smell right to me, - I'm callin' Sheriff Wyner, - No! Madam!
please, please, Madam!
no, no, I beg of, yes! Yes!
it is a lie! It is a fantastic tale!
you have us dead to rights, but, madam, please, please, please allow me to tell you the truth in private,
madam,
madam, we are not musicians of the late Renaissance, - Nor of the early, nor mid period, - Mm-hm,
we are, in fact, criminals,
desperate men, Mrs, Munson,
we have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Bandit Queen gambling emporium - and relieved it of its treasure, - Lord have mercy,
it is true,
the Bandit Queen is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin by exciting the vice of greed with her promise of easy winnings, Oh, yes,
her gains are ill-gotten,
but, I offer no excuses - save one,
we men have each pledged one half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution,
in compensation for the use of your home, we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same,
but now you have wrested the information from me,
there you have it, It is on your table, Mrs, Munson,
the "awful truth,"
stolen money, - But find the victim, Mrs, Munson,
I challenge you, even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorrah, shall suffer no harm,
it has an insurance company,
a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults,
that is its function,
and that insurance company has tens and tens of thousands of policyholders,
so that, We have done the calculations, Mrs, Munson,
so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each and every one of those policyholders shall have contributed one penny,
one, single, solitary cent to the satisfaction of this claim, - One penny? - One penny, Think of it, Mrs, Munson,
one penny from those thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission,
why, I have no doubt that, were those policy holders made aware of the existence of that august institution, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount for the furtherance of its aims,
well, that's probably true,
sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes as long, that is, as the secret stays with us,
well,
I can't hardly see the harm in it, - One penny? - One penny, - I'm sorry, - Excuse me?
no, I'm sorry, it's wrong, and don't you be leadin' me into temptation, - No, no, madam, I must strenuously, - I'm sorry, it's just plain wrong, - Stealin'! - No, madam, - I know your intentions was good, - No, they weren't!
and I won't call the police if you give back the money and y'all go to church with me next Sunday,
and engage in divine worship?!
I've made up my mind,
now, you can doubletalk all you want, it's church or the county jail,
think it over, I gotta feed the cat, - Motherfuck! - Yes,
unfortunately, Mrs, Munson has rather complicated the situation,
Yeah, well, I know how to decomplicate it,
you bust a cap in that old bitch's head, everything be simple,
not easy to do, Many reasons,
practical ones: Quiet neighborhood, sleepy town,
reasons of moral repugnance: A harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood,
Oh, no, Gawain, would that it were simple,
well, fuck, man! What we gonna do? Give the money back and go to church?
I shudder, I quake,
you, sir, are a Buddhist,
is there not a "middle" way?
must float like a leaf on the river of life, , and kill old lady,
Yes, yes, I suppose you are right,
it is the active nature of the crime, though, that so abhors,
the squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife,
but, let us think a moment,
what other tools do we have at hand?
we have the cellar,
we have the cavity,
we have masonry and trowel,
perhaps we could simply, immure her,
sure, easiest thing in the world, I can whip up a little mortar in a snow saucer,
lay the bricks, anchor in some chains,
mountain Girl could outsource the manacles,
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen, we delude ourselves,
no, shortest and painless is best,
Gawain's gun, retort muffled by a pillow, into the brain, the affair of an instant,
the only question is who wields the weapon?
I believe it is traditional in such circumstances to draw straws,
fair enough, here you go, Lump,
I'm thinkin', though, that since I lost a finger
and I mean literally lost it 'cause of that fuckin' cat
maybe I should be excused from this thing,
hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway,
you one whiny muthafucka,
I'll come over there and squeeze your fuckin' nutsack, you keep that bullshit up,
shut up, punk!
I'll kick your goddamn ass, sweet-legs! - Gentlemen!
no special pleading, No exceptions,
it is of the nature of the situation we would all prefer to be excused,
well, OK, it was just a trial balloon,
long straw, You all see it, all that fuss for nothin', punk,
fuck you,
Motherfuck!
Lord, I'm troubled
Lord, I'm troubled
Lord, I'm troubled .Oh, lord, by my soul
my Lord, but when I get up in the Kingdom, lord
I won't be troubled no more - Oh, Lord, I'm troubled - Lord, I'm troubled
Lord, I'm troubled - Oh, would you like a hot cross bun? - No, just an explanation.
coming up!
Ouisie, I'll take some cocoa. - Hi, George.
what's goin ' on?
George! How did they get in here?!
what you got there, Gawain? - Why, nothin', Mama,
nothin', my ass! You got a dog there!
no, Mama, - A filthy, noisy little pest of a puppy dog - gonna shit all over the house! - He won't shit in the house, Mama,
I'm gonna train him, I promise, I'll train him real good!
I'm gonna train you real good!
you wait till your daddy get home, he gonna lay into you proper!
no, Mama! Please, Mama! I love you!
your daddy gonna kick yo' ass!
mama's whuppin' Gawain's ass!
ain't you gonna use the strap, Mama?
I love you, Mama, I'm sorry, Mama, I love you,
Yeah, I'll wipe the dog's ass and everything, Mama,
I'll train him to shit in the toilet, Mama, - I'll wipe his ass and everything, Mama, - What you doin'?
what you doin' with my pillow?
nothin', ma'am, I just came down to get a, - Ugh! - I'm displeased with you!
Yeah, but, - Fine colored boy like you - fallin' in with that trash downstairs! - Ugh!
now, I know your mama taught you better than that!
I can't do it, she remind me of my mama, - Look, man, - Why, this is most irregular , y'all muthafuckas just gonna have to draw straws again,
wait a minute, you've got to accept your responsibilities, young man, and shoot that old lady,
Hey, man, fuck you and your irritated bowel!
must shoot,
now, look here, it's the easiest thing in the world,
just pretend her head's a casaba melon and the gun is a melon baller,
what the fuck are you talkin' about? A melon baller?
look, man, you do it, - Oh, this is most irregular,
now, look, with equal rights comes equal responsibility,
I'm afraid Mr Pancake is correct, We cannot draw straws again,
the exercise would lose all credibility if you show the loser can simply beg off,
must shoot,
Hey, look, man, she's just an old colored lady to you,
come on, man, you do it, - Why, you sniveling little coward, - What did you say to me?
sniveling little coward, - You whiny muthafucka,
I will come up yo' stankin', irritated asshole with this gun and give you a lead colonic, muthafucka!
you think you scare me, you mewling punk?
you don't scare me, Bull Connor and all his dogs didn't scare me!
now, be a man,
you fuck! You ain't no fuckin' man!
Oh, my, this is most distressin', - Be a man!
you ain't no fuckin' man! Fuckin' a 60-year-old with pigtails!
why, you bastard punk! Mountain Girl is 53!
she could ride your ass to jelly! - Oh, yeah?!
gentlemen, please! - I seen Virginia hams
I'd rather stick my dick in than that big ol' white chick!
Oh, my God,
Oh, no,
Oh, my, - I think he's hit, - Oh, no,
I'll just check the carotid artery, - That's a negative, - Is he dead, Professor?
Oh, sure he's dead, Lump, I just checked his carotid artery, Well, this is most irregular,
we shall need a Hefty bag,
she is in the kitchen,
you steal out with the carcass while I dazzle her with conversation,
my dear Mrs, Munson, I have outlined your position with my colleagues, and I now return to you to render our collective verdict,
there was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give-and-take,
some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money, Some were more receptive,
I don't care if they was receptive or not!
and that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions,
to a man, I must say they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities, - Well, that is a shame, - lndeed, but at the end of the day, your position prevailed,
so we have decided to return the money, every last cent of it, and attend Sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our days wastin' away at the Mississippi Men's Correctional Facility,
though that was the original preference of some,
you are not assistin' with the cadaver,
Oh, no need,
just chuck it off the bridge, easiest thing in the world, - I'm just cleanin' up here,
Oh! That's them, back already,
I'll just go dump these in the hearse,
Yeah, easiest thing in the world,
general!
no extra share, huh?
mountain? - Garth?
l, B,S, dear?
Oh, come
let us go back
to God - Go back to God - Oh, come on - Let's go back to God - Let us go back - Let's go back to God - Come on
let's go back to God
get Garth,
let us go back
to God
go back to God
excellent, I believe, at last, we have the right man for the job,
the old woman is a more formidable antagonist than one had imagined,
now, Lump, it falls to you to finish the job, - The comedy must end, - You know, - I've been doin' some thinkin', Professor, - Oh, dear,
maybe we should be goin' to church, maybe she is right,
Ooh, dear, Lump, I feared those would be your words,
not that I don't appreciate you giving the matter the benefit of your thought, but recall, my dear boy, our respective functions in this enterprise,
I am a professor, The professor, as you yourself so often say, The thinker,
trained, in fact, in the arts of cogitation,
you, Lump, are the goon, the hooligan, the dumb brute, whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence,
Yeah, I know, but,
Ah, ah, ah! No buts, dear boy, do not repeat the error of thinkin',
now is the moment of praxis, now, Lump, you must act,
well, I can't do it, Professor, a nice old lady like that,
think of the riches, Lump, that you and I alone shall divide,
Yeah, I know, but,
and reflect also that if you decline to act, thus forcin' me to do so, you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money,
your offices shall have been nugatory,
you mean you're gonna kill her?
of course, yes, my hand shall be forced,
I can't allow you to do that, Professor, You, allow? - Mm-hm,
not allow?
what presumption!
you stupid boy!
you very, very, extremely stupid boy,
Oh, yeah?
who looks stupid now?
no bullets?
perhaps it had to be thus, "Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
how statue-like I see thee stand,
a raven.
, The agate lamp within thy hand!
Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
are Holy Land!
Ugh!
huh?
Uh-huh,
professor?
mm, mm, mm! Couldn't face the music,
I appreciate that, but we don't know what to do, tried that, too,
Oh, - Uh, Mrs, Munson, - Gotta make a statement, Sheriff,
ma'am, could it possibly wait? We're kinda busy down here today,
Oh, well, I suppose it could wait, but it's about that casino money,
let me call you back, you know somethin' about it?
somethin'? Everything! I got it at home, - You got what at home? - The money! $1, 6 million dollars, - It's down in my root cellar, - How did it get there, Marva?
well, a bunch of desperate men stole it and put it there, that's how!
see, they was musicians of the Renaissance period, turned out they really couldn't play, but they could recite poems that'd break your heart, - The ringleader spoke in dead tongues, - Does he now?
Oh, I tried to get you to see him, - That night, - Yes, ma'am,
I had to holler at 'em about stealin' all that money,
and I guess I made'emfeel real bad, 'cause they just picked up and left without takin' the money!
and they let Pickles out!
so you want us to come over and fetch him,
Oh, no, no, he's back,
what you want me to do with the money?
you keep it! Why don't you keep it?
keep it? - Go on and keep it, Miss Marva,
well,
it is just a penny off of everybody's policy, - Could,?
you don't suppose I could,? - Yes, ma'am?
could I just give it all to Bob Jones University?
Yeah, That'd be nice,
give it all to 'em! That's a good idea!
as long as everybody knows,
how you doin'?
pickles! Oh, Lord, Pickles!

my voice was never that deep at age three.
my kindergarten teacher Rigmor says kids mature faster today.
I'm so tired of Rigmor!
Rigmor says you're tired of yourself.
but I'm wonderful! Why would I be tired of myself?
very funny!
you never Laugh at anything funny.
Rigmor says that Laughter is a sign of instability.
you're one twisted kid, Bud. And Rigmor is a crown idiot.
good morning, my Lovely architect! Sweet dreams?
I dreamt that I got to design a house by myself!
how can you dream about something that boring?
Rigmor says... -Shut up, Bud!
I agree! " Rigmor says bIah-bIah-bIah. "
it's time for a new kindergarten. -Excellent idea.
good morning, my conservative son. -Get thee hence, Laborer!
get thee hence, satanic rocker!
were it up to me, there'd be more police on the streets. To arrest you!
Rigmor!
what is important, children? -Your inner self. Your inner self.
morning, Gunnar.
Kurt!
is it really necessary with such rough Language, boys?
can't we all just get along?
what do you think about canceling the forklift race this year?
what do you mean? -The mood here is already aggressive.
we don't need any more competition. Let's all hug!
the race is on, Gunnar!
and I intend to crush everyone, as usual!
Almighty then! Let's get back to work, boys.
Yes!
you motherfucker!
is that Language necessary?
Kurt TURNS EVIL
pancakes again? Why can't we have canapes and wine?
this is forklift-driver food.
four out of five here are not forklift drivers.
and four out of five here will never become Young Conservatives.
have you had a nice architect day? What is this?
nothing. -It's a Lovely forklift garage!
it's a doghouse! No one sees my true talent. I want to draw bigger things.
size doesn't matter. Except when it comes to forklifts.
sorry!
careful, you Polish idiot! You could have ruined my statue!
hi there!
Dr. Petter. I'm your new neighbor.
you practically ruined our house!
not much of a house. At Least not for a doctor.
perhaps you aren't doctors? -Rigmor says all people are equal.
here's money for repairs. There's more where that came from.
you think you can ruin our house and buy your way out?
Yup. -We'll see about that!
what a charming doghouse! Are you an architect?
architect is such a big word. But yes, I suppose I am.
I Love architects. Simply Love them!
do you Love forklifts? -Nope. Talk to you Later.
wonderful Copenhagen!
what are you doing?!
what an exciting, delightful man. -Delightful?
he destroyed our house! -But he paid for the damages.
he has a new house. He probably needs an architect.
can we buy a car Like Dr. Petter's?
I don't want some stupid doctor's car!
we couldn't afford it anyway. Because Fat Helena eats too much!
a new car? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
what do you say, Bud? -Rigmor says to Love what you have.
what was that?
what is he doing over there?
he's blasting out his newpool. -How do you know?
because I'm drawing it! -Traitor! Quisling!
he pays well. And we need the money.
'we need the money. " Jesus Christ!
dinner is served!
I'm eating at Dr. Petter's tonight. Hope you don't mind.
he's inaugurating his new barbecue.

I'm riding with Dr. Petter today. Wonderful Copenhagen!

Dr. Petter's food tastes Like shit compared to this!
don't talk Like that about his food. He's my client, after all.
can't we get a private chef? Dr. Petter's getting one tomorrow.
what's happening tomorrow? -He's inaugurating his new pool.
didn't I mention that?
doctors and architects are coming.
maybe even the prime minister!
I'm not going. -Why not?
I plan on arranging my own pool party.
I may have forgotten to invite you. I've been so busy.
but we don't have a pool. -That's what you think!
how unfortunate that our two parties happened to clash.
what a bummer! -Look at all those exciting guests!
doctors and architects...
fortunately we prefer being here, the whole family.
almost the whole family. -They're talking about my pool!
that guy's mouth Looks Like a butthole!
what? Are you going to talk to them?
maybe just a Little. But I'll come to your party Later.
are you enjoying the party, Bud?
Rigmor says having fun...
...is overrated.
I understand if you want to go. -Maybe just a short visit?
go ahead, Bud.
lobster?
hope you're having fun, even though you don't fit in.
look, there's the prime minister!
I know her, you don't.
Hi, prime minister! Huge breasts!
thank you. I'm nice and popular, so everything's great.
no shrimp during the campaign! Spoiled shrimp makes her sick.
wonderful Copenhagen!
I hear you're a forklift driver.
I Love driving my forklift. Always have.
but it isn't very important. -Huh?
it can't be as important as certain other jobs.
like what? -Like my job. I'm a doctor.
I make sure people stay healthy. Imagine if no one was healthy!
that would be bad. But forklifts are important too.
do you have a pager? -What's that?
Kurt doesn't know what a pager is!
a pager is something all doctors have.
when it beeps, we rush to the hospital and save someone.
I don't have a pager. -No, I bet you don't.
I am a doctor, and I am... Wonderful Copenhagen!
I just Love doctors! Dr. Petter knows so many exciting people.
I talked to the prime minister! Can you imagine?
Dr. Petter wants me to design his new garage.
isn't it wonderful?
I don't think you should talk so much about Dr. Petter.
you should talk about me. I'm the one you're most fond of.
you are most fond of me, right, Anne-Lise?
and you think driving forklifts is extremely important, don't you?
Cheers!
the forklift race is coming up pretty soon.
I think I'll pass this year.
see you Later, guys!
Hey, be careful!
Oh-La-La! You saved my Life!
are you a...doctor?
sure.
sleeping under water can result in a premature death.
I know. But we sailors are airways so tired when we go ashore.
we spend our nights awake, fooling around and drinking.
well, don't drink too much, exercise and eat fiber.
wait! In my family, if someone saves our Life,
we give them our most prized possession.
what is your most prized possession? -I have nothing.
but if I find something nice, I'll make sure you get it.
time to upgrade that kindergarten, Rigmor!
the only thing that needs upgrading is your head!
is there a doctor here? We need a doctor!
we need a doctor!
is there a doctor here?
is there a doctor here? We need a doctor!
did you say doctor? At your service!
thank goodness! A woman over here needs help.
you aren't a doctor. -Shut up!
then I'm a doctor too. -You're a tiny moron!
Rigmor has taught us first aid. I'm as much of a doctor as you.
please, doctor!
are you a doctor? -Yes.
me too. -Him too?
then help her!
let's see...
where does it hurt? -In my butt.
in your butt. Let me see... How old are you?
42. -Have you eaten spoiled shrimp?
no. -Have you put anything up your butt?
no. -Should we call an ambulance?
or a better doctor?
a miracle! That's what I call doctors!
allow me to buy you an insanely Luxurious dinner.
wonderful Copenhagen!
Hello, doctor!
let's get a job at the hospital. -Rigmor wouldn't...

Exactly! And I say Let's get a job at the hospital.
I'm a doctor, and I need a phone!
gunnar speaking. -Hi. I quit as of...right now.
you can't quit. You've always been a forklift driver. The best.
I need a more important job now.
you're important to me. -You don't know any better.
you've never talked Like this before, Kurt.
that's your problem! I'm a doctor now. Bye!
Hello? Rigmor?
bud's a doctor and you can go to hell!
here's the doctor's office. -Here's the head doctor's office.
here's the chief head doctor's office.
and here's the super mega chief head doctor's office!
damned piece-of-junk machine!
are you the super mega chief? -Yes, who are you?
we are two doctors in search of a job.
we are thumbtack specialists. -And drowning specialists.
interesting. Let me see your diplomas.
I think I Left mine at home. -I don't have one.
he's been in surgery all night. He Left his at home too.
I can't offer you a job without seeing your diplomas.
fine. -Be gone!
sorry for the interruption.
maybe you should try... pushing right here.
marvelous! We need more doctors Like you. I can make an exception.
that diploma is nothing but cellulose, right?
exactly. -But why is he so small?
he Looks Like a youngster.
he may not be old, but he is very capable.
are you capable? -I can even read and count.
Rigmor says... -Rigmor?
she's another doctor. -Is she now?
the job is yours! -With a pager?
that goes without saying.
without a pager, we doctors would be utterly worthies!
and now we're doctors! That wasn't so hard.
Patlent for Dr. Kurt.
the hard part is treating patients. Come in!
how are you feeling today?
I'm feeling great. -Good. And you?
my stomach hurts. -What do you say, Bud? A band-aid?
I don't see any damage. -My stomach hurts inside.
we can't see inside your stomach, idiot!
how could we be able to see inside your stomach?
but what about my stomach pain? -We'll feed you a band-aid sandwich.
get well soon!
we handled that well. -What if he doesn't get better?
then he'll come back. By then we'll be better doctors.
all we need is some practice. Next!
are you going to help her? -What if it's contagious?
real doctors don't worry about that. -We aren't real.
aren't you real doctors? -Sure! That's a manner of speaking.
doctor humor is quite special.
have you eaten spoiled shrimp? -Can you help me, doctor?
help me, doctor!
I think I can help you.
there and there. OK, you're fit as a fiddle!
thank you. -What do you think, Bud?
I'll say! That woman Looked cured. -Yes, we are quite capable.
I should hope so. I need help with an operation tomorrow.
an operation? -You want us to operate on someone?
the two of us? -Is that a problem?
not at all. No problem. We can't wait!
eager as kids.
scalpel.
see? How hard can it be? -Child's play.
dinner!
what is it with you? -Wait till mother comes.
I need to calculate the angle between that beam and...
would you be proud if your father was...a doctor?
'kill all the doctors, kill all the nurses... "
does this mean a new house, car and cabin?
you bet! Because doctors are Loaded!
and the worst disease you've seen? -There are so many...
has anyone been uglier than Helena?
my hair!
what's going on?
they're just happy because their father is a...doctor.
you aren't a doctor! -Aren't you?
I have a pager.
it's illegal to pass oneself off as a doctor.
you could go to jail! It takes seven years to become a doctor.
what will Dr. Petter say? -Seven years?!
Rigmor says time is relative. Seven years could only take a minute.
so you aren't a doctor? -I am. Now we can hunt and travel...
one can be whatever one wants! That's what all your magazines claim.
and I'm sure Rigmor does too.
starting tomorrow you are no Longer a doctor. Promise?
I promise.
wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen!
I notice that you placed that Lung in the wrong bowl, Dr. Kurt.
rumor has it you aren't doctors. That you've been fooling us.
says who?
impersonating a doctor is a very serious crime.
you could almost call it...mean.
mean? Rigmor says it's important never to be mean.
are you doctors, or not?
a scandal!

a scandal!
false doctors are Loose in the hospital! It's a scandal!

Hooray! I'm cured!
a scandal!
my back! -Let's go back in.
a scandal! Huge breasts, by the way.
thank you. What is going on?
they pretended to be doctors. -Outrageous!
aren't you Dr. Petter's neighbor? -Yes. Nice to see you again.
no, it isn't! You can't go around pretending to be a doctor.
and neither can your son. -We just wanted to feel important.
being a forklift driver is also important.
although not as important as prime minister or doctor.
or policeman. -Or doctor.
we said doctor! -It can be repeated.
then prime minister should be too. -Doctor, doctor!
prime minister... -Doctor...
fc Rosenberg!
I just wanted to feel important. -I don't care.
you deserve a spanking and a huge fine.
wonderful Copenhagen, yes!
you just wait. I'll show all of you!
for SALE -What about breakfast? -I'm tired of everything.
scandal!
you promised not to play doctor! -Did I really promise?
I just wanted you to be proud of me. -I am. Sometimes.
once Last year, or was it two years ago...
what a huge fine!
did you get a fine, too? Let me see.
we're ruined! -Ruined?
won't we be able to afford food?
watch my hair! -Enough of this. Kurt!
you're a forklift driver. Now go back to work!
but I told Gunnar I quit. -Start again. You have a fine to pay.
good to see you again! -Likewise.
what is that? -I owe you my most prized possession.
it's a...diamond!
wonderful Copenhagen!
Rigmor says that diamonds suck. Big time.
have you Lost your mind? You can sell this for millions!
are you a goldsmith? -Maybe. It depends.
are you a goldsmith? -You bet!
amazing. Awesome. Fantastic!
well? Is it a good diamond? -I've never seen anything Like it!
I would Love to buy it. It is worth...
your diamond is worth...
60 million kroner.
million?!
that sounds fine. -Great. Let me get your money.
by the way, 60 million is a lot of money.
are you independently wealthy? -No.
then I think you should be careful.
it isn't easy to suddenly come across great wealth.
you can easily become...evil.
thanks for the tip, but relax. I'm nice, popular and sweet.
fc Rosenberg!
now what? -Your Load is too high.
I'm giving you a fine. -Is this the prime minister's idea?
doesn't she have better things to do than decide what I can't do?
there! I don't have time for stupid policemen.
you can't call policemen stupid! That's a 600-kroner fine.
is that all? In that case I'll also call you a jerk,
a crown idiot and a butt-bugger.
your fine just grew to 1600 kroner!
What?!
you are evil! You just earned yourself a pile of fines!
watch out, or I'll buy the entire police station
and put you and all your buddies in jail!
my mustache...
my word, have you gotten rich?
there must be millions here!
around 60, actually. -Fantastic!
gosh! -We can buy whatever we want!
a car Like Dr. Petter's. -And a pool, and a house Like his!
Helena can go to Satan concerts, and I can go to medical school!
just Like Dr. Petter!
if I hear Dr. Petter's name one more time,
I'll high-pressure hose you all back to the Stone Age!
can we at Least get a new car, and sell this junk?
we're keeping the forklift. -Are you stupid?
we don't need the forklift now that we're rich!
actually, I'm the one who's rich. You're just as poor as always.
none of you get anything! I want it all for myself.
I'll give Bud a weekly allowance of 10, 000 kroner.
from now on, Bud and I are going to have all the fun.
what do you want to do, Bud? -I haven't seen Rigmor for a while...
no, Bud, I'm not talking about kindergarten fun.
I'm talking about real, total fun. Fun, fun, fun!
the WORLDS BIGGESTSTORE
the WORLDS BIGGESTRACETRACK
the WORLDS BIGGEST COD LIVER OIL BOTTLE -I want that! -We have the forklift.
forklifts are for wimps! This is a machine for real men!
hello.
fun, fun, fun!
you're ruining the track! -But I have school tomorrow.
I'll give you 200 kroner to let me use your room.
it's a deal!
Kurt, it's for you!
you have a visitor.
fc Rosenberg! Are you the one building illegal racetracks?
why is my racetrack illegal? -It isn't inside!
you can't build racetracks through doctors' houses.
not to mention, you're blocking the road for the prime minister.
fine, give me a ticket. -You still have to remove the track.
I'll pay, you remove the track. -No. That's illegal.
the prime minister has decided that.
you again? -Let me do whatever I want.
I can pay you. I have 60 million.
you have to do as I say. In the big picture, 60 million isn't very much.
if I were prime minister, I'd Let rich people do anything.
well I am the prime minister! And I am nice and popular.
get his track out of my house! -First I want the street cleared.
that's more important.
don't bother the prime minister! -It's OK. Good to see you again.
likewise. Imagine that she remembered me!
I want to be prime minister too. -It isn't that easy.
you have to be elected. -How?
get people to vote for you.
but you don't stand a chance. Because I am nice and popular.
I'm nice and popular too. -Good Luck, then!
let's see...
if I ran for prime minister, would you vote for me?
I don't know. -What do you mean?
I don't know where you stand. -Where I stand?
I'm for everything that's good. -We'll see.
here his family helps out. - " Kill all journalists... "
forget Helena. All she cares about is Satan.
may I take a picture? -Of course.
please move. I only want a picture of the candidate.
forget it, Bud. I'm the one who's going to be prime minister.
but I'm sure you'll be prime minister some day too.
I doubt it.
ladles and gentlemen, please welcome Kurt!
unemployment, improved roads, cheap food from Sweden, taxes!
everyone should be happy, save the environment. Thank you.
Kurt is the best! Kurt is the best!
what about elderly care? -Nothing concerns me more!
elderly care! Elderly care! Elderly care! Elderly care!
elderly care!
elderly care!
and now our second candidate, the prime minister!
you can't vote for her. She can't even stay on her feet!
you tripped her! -Of course. Everything is allowed.
that was a cheap trick. -That was politics.
you have a choice: Vote for me, a nice and popular person,
or vote for Kurt, who is mean.
I'm not mean! You're ugly and smell Like farts!
you smell Like farts!
Kurt is best. Kurt is best...
where are you going? Stay here and watch me win!
no discussion! The prime minister decides!
you'd think a prime minister could expect some support from his family.
what if you Lose? -Only chickens have a plan B.
you should probably be a Little more chicken.
of course I'm going to be prime minister! Right, Bud?
bud?
quiet, here it comes!
let's see how many votes Kurt received.
didn't you vote for me?
it appears as lf our buxom friend will remain prime minister.
no, no, no!
not everyone can be prime minister. You're a forklift driver.
but apparently that isn't good enough for any of you!
you're the biggest Loser I've ever met, Kurt!
must be tough Living next to a wonderful man Like me.
I'll show you!
police? No, I'm not calling to praise FC Rosenberg!
Kurt has turned evil!
is there a carpenter here?
I am witnessing some strong scenes from the helicopter.
Kurt is evil!
maybe I should have voted for him.
I don't condone anarchistic behavior.
neither does Rigmor. -I can hear your voices!
I can hear you talk. This is Lovely! Say something else.
my back!
I am pleased, but not surprised, that I became prime minister.
I am much more important than Kurt will ever be.
fc Rosenberg forever!
gotcha! -How incredibIy annoying.
did you really do all this? -Yup, I'm afraid so.
you are neither nice nor popular. Shame on you!
right!
No!
help me!
now you can think about what you have done.
Hey, you.
what are you in for? -I did something bad.
Really? I sold spoiled shrimp.
I put thumbtacks on random chairs.
I tried to crush Parliament. -Did you succeed?
Nope. -Then you sleep on the floor.
kurtis EVIL
Kurt, you are accused of being evil.
what do you have to say?
I regret it bitterly and will never do it again.
I wasn't myself. -You weren't? Who were you?
I wanted to be Like Dr. Petter and the prime minister.
but no one thought I was important, so I snapped and Lost my head.
has that never happened to you?
Yes, actually. -See?
I'll give you a choice:
go back to jail, or pay a fine of 40 million kroner.
I'll pay the fine. -Do you have 40 million?
and 40, 000, 000. There you are.
now go home and think about what you have done.
you betcha!
I've been thinking. I don't think everything was your fault.
you aren't still evil, are you?
aren't you coming in?
no, a Loser Like me deserves to sit on top of a pole.
Hey, is Kurt up there?
what? -Are you coming back to work?
I'm never coming down again! -You can be head forklift driver.
Nope!
how about head chief forklift driver?
with a promotion! -All I need is a grain of rice a day.
goodbye!
but what about the forklift race? It's tomorrow.
how long does he intend to stay up there?
forever.
when he comes down, tell him to get my car out of the pool!
he has more important things to worry about.
don't be rude! I'm paying you to draw my garage.
maybe I don't want to draw your garage!
I hate architects!
Hi, Bud! You're just in time for meditation.
ready, set...
Anne-Lise!

I need my forklift!
Oh, no you don't! Help me with my car first!

kurtis THE BEST
sorry.
never mind. We're just happy you're moving.
I understand. I didn't fit in here next to you.
aren't that the truth.
is this enough to... repair the damages?
I have a better idea.
kindergarten
nice throw.
please watch your Language, boys!
Yes, 5000 minutes passed.
we're about to celebrate.
there will be six tables of reporters at least. Okay, that's it.
please don't beat me!
I beg you, stop it...
dad, please don't beat me!
mom, save me please...
dad...
let me go!
Fred!
mom, save me please!
Fred...
Fred...
doctor, how is it going?
his situation is critical, let's hurry for the rescue.
Fred Lo!
if we save him now, it just means a total loss!
Mr. Wang, do you want his life instead?
drag him out! Be quick!
Fred Lo...
give way...
give way, don't block the way...
Mr. Wang, can you say something?
the famous Hong Kong magician Fred Lo...
I met my Waterloo...
he failed to break the world's record.
but his extreme will to fight and vitality are very much appreciated.
now, we wish him getting well soon.
and, wish him to make another challenge at his earliest convenience.
miss Li, Mr. Lo's skin eruption and the low reading of blood sugar...
basically, they have recovered already.
but we must pay special attention to his mental condition.
we can't let his problem of having sleepwalking & hallucination go worse.
I suggest him to have a long period of medication and rest.
well, how long will it take?
I suggest half year would do.
half year?
in this period...
Mr. Lo should be avoided from stress and excitement.
Hello, Miss Li...
I am a reporter from the Gossip Weekly.
I have repeated many times!
he rejects any interviews.
I'd like to know about Mr. Lo's health.
I told you, he is fine.
we are fine too!
thank you for your call. Goodbye,
Fred, we must take a good rest this time.
we won't go anywhere.
we have been real busy for two years.
we haven't had a vacation for a long time.
right?
so, this time, you must listen to me.
forget everything.
just spend a vacation with me.
I am with you, okay?
sure.
Mr. Lo, how are you? Long time no see!
Hi, may I know your name please?
my name is Sara Li, may I know your name please?
just call me Yuen.
this is your key.
about the management fee of this house,
Mr. Li has paid already, you don't have to pay a penny.
thank you.
your friend is so attentive!
where is he now?
who?
I am talking about your friend Li.
be frank, I just don't know where he is.
I just know he seldom comes here.
let' s go in.
let's go.
your friend has got weird taste.
cause he is a behavior artist.
how long can we stay here?
how long would you like to stay?
Fred Lo...
don't panic...
all right, it's okay.
all right, don't panic!
I have just seen a...
a girl with long hairjust stared at me!
it's okay, I am with you, don't panic!
I am with you now, don't panic.
don't panic!
Hello, my name is Li. How about you?
my name is Yue.
Hi, do you live in that block?
have you just moved in?
Yes, we have just moved in.
how long will you stay?
we haven't made up our mind yet.
Fred...
Fred...
you're disgusting! You always fool me!
are you chicken? I bet not, huh?
I just can't tell why...
after moving in, I just always feel something strange.
I lost sleep last night,
I made many weird dreams.
you just haven't acclimatized.
okay, go get a bath.
I will go prepare the dinner.
okay.
Hey, did you fool me by the pool side?
what did you say?
I suffered so much after that performance.
the sponsor cut half of the money, 2 million, you know?
did I ask you to compensate anything? No.
all right, for another matter.
the medical fee costs me hundred thousand, it's quite a sum of money.
say the operation fee, ward fee, so and so...
I paid everything! It's too kind of me, huh?
I suffered so much!
Fred, can you think something to help me?
what do you want?
Mr. Wang, I understand your situation.
but Fred hasn't recovered yet.
you'd better give him more time for recovery, okay?
I can wait, but not my 20 staffs.
they have no money for food!
Fred, let's cut it short.
one month, make another show after one month,
just help me, okay?
we just can't do it.
the doctor said, he needs at least six months to get recovered.
please don't push us. Okay?
half a year? Sara, don't kid me.
I talked to the doctor, I asked him.
about two or three months,
Fred can recover 60% of his strength.
I don't want him to break another world's record, just do some relaxing performance, okay?
Fred, one month, okay?
think something for me.
but you know pretty well that Fred loves challenging his personal limit.
he doesn't want to waste time for something not challenging.
what does that mean?
give me some time to think, okay?
won't you give me time for thinking?
one month? Why not having a show now?
you think it's just a piece of cake?
earlier the better.
it's perfect to have a show next month, students will be in holidays.
deal, okay?
do you mean it?
I just won't mind that fatty. I'd better take a sleep.
director Lam, how are you doing?
Yes, who is speaking?
Hi, this is Sara.
Hi, Sara, what's the matter?
director Lam, well...
Fred is now in his recovery.
but his manager just came to ask him perform.
I worry about his health, so I call to ask for your help.
do you have some jobs for Fred?
so he'd take it and forget the dangerous performance.
good! In our pinacotheca, we are now planning an memorized exhibition for Fred's daddy...after his death for 20 years.
if Fred can make a statue for his dad...
this would be a great contribution to the exhibition.
Really? That's such a good idea.
director, when can you meet us?
okay, thank you.
see you tomorrow.
Fred...
I saw snakes!
Fred, is that you?
Fred...
come out now, or I'd get real mad!
I will count to three.
who are you?
who are you?
who are you?
I... I live here.
you are not.
you don't live here.
that is a man.
but you are a woman.
you are not human being.
there are so many things behind you.
what's up with you?
Fred, ghost...
I saw ghost in our house. It's true!
it's true!
look!
a horror film is on TV, you did see the reflection, right?
I am scared!
don't panic! If there is ghost,
I am always with you, I'll help you.
I'll blow it away, okay?
okay?
I am so curious...
how can the woman next door come into our house?
we don't lock up, so she was in.
there are only two families living around.
she came for a visit, it's nothing strange.
but I think... she is kinda...
having psychic problem.
and, I just feel uneasy living here.
I feel kinda... haunted.
my friend is a behaviour artist!
such kind of people...
be frank, I don't appreciate such decorations.
Yes, the director of the pinacotheca just called you.
he wants to see you.
but I don't.
well, I think...
he is your father's buddy, he is your senior, too.
he wants to see you, I guess...
that is about something important, right?
you don't say no, so I take it a yes!
just go and have a tea, okay? Good boy!
we are free tomorrow, anyway.
in next month, Mr. Lo passed away for 20 years.
we'd like to hold an exhibition for Mr. Lo.
so we hope you can make a statue for your dad.
it would become the theme piece of the exhibition.
I haven't made statue for ages, I think, I just can't make it.
if you can't, who else can make a better one?
your father always praised you in front of us.
Fred, just say yes to Director Lam.
by the way, change your job, it would bring you another kind of life, right?
Sara is right.
just forget those bad memories.
focus yourself to make a perfect statue, okay?
this is a great thing for your dad.
boss, you want to meet me?
Frank Yue, come and take a seat.
you know it pretty well that...
the sales of our company has been going down in these years.
so, we want to explore our market in Mainland China in quick speed.
from the management team, you are the best guy to take the job.
if you help me, sure I would feel assured.
but my plan is...
boss, can I take my family with me?
if everything goes smooth,
I think, you just have to stay there for half a year.
boss, you know my family problem.
my wife and daughter need me to take care of them.
why not you ask Hark to go instead?
I really want to stay in Hong Kong.
you can hire a maid to take care of them.
if not, ask some relatives to do so.
boss, you don't understand.
so, tell me their problems.
health problem.
so seek for medication.
think about it.
you haven't got bonus for a long time.
if you do a good job...
why not make more money?
where have you been?
can you find it?
okay, sure...
Mr. Yue...
Hi, I would like to ask you one thing.
a woman came to our house last night.
is she your family?
what did you say?
that woman has got long hair, she is quite pretty looking.
but I think she has mental problem.
leave her alone.
in such remote place, it's nothing strange to see haunted matters.
lock up well.
or, place some Taoist magic figures there.
so either men or ghost dare not go in.
what a weird guy!
please place it right here.
thank you.
I'll cook you the dinner, okay?
what are you doing?
making a statue.
still making a statue of mine?
you are able to do so?
you better find someone to do it for you. And not to make me shameful.
what are you looking at?
what is it?
go now!
good morning.
what are you looking?
can I help you?
who are you?
I am your neighbour, I just moved in.
I lost my ring, my wedding ring.
what is it like? What color?
it's gold...
and, silver...
with a diamond on it.
where is it?
ask your hubby not to peep at us.
what did you say?
I said, your hubby is nosy.
if you don't understand, go ask him.
Mr. Yue, I don't know what's happened.
can you make it clear?
are there only you two living here?
Mr. Yue, I think this is kinda nosy.
I've told you already. Help yourself.
what's up?
where have you been? What took you so long?
I...
Why?
because you have taken good care of me.
I got hurt, and you came here to take a rest.
so I bought you this gift.
anything else?
and something else...
I love you!
Fred.
Fred...
Fred...
Fred, is that you?
Fred!
what are you doing?
you've seen that!
there are many weird things in this house.
you'd better move out.
if you don't...
I am afraid you would become them.
what are you bluffing about?
did you put those things in my house to scare me?
approach me!
leave her alone!
kill her...
I am leaving...
take care!
who are you talking to?
how long will you stay here?
did you see anyone passing by?
I think, you'd better move out.
Why?
someone died in this house, this is haunted.
you are not allowed to trespass our house as you like.
please tell your wife.
nonsense!
it's late at night, where have you been?
where have you been?
I am asking you, where have you been?
I have always been here, look, you are still wearing pajamas.
why do you stay up this late, huh?
I went round the house.
because I saw snakes again.
woo, there are so many things in this house!
so, did you see tigers or lions here?
okay, you can take me psychotic, or, it's my illusion.
anyway, I just can't tolerate our neighbors. They're weird!
let's move out! Let's move out tomorrow.
okay.
but first, you must tell me.
who drove you so mad?
suddenly, someone says that our house is haunted.
on the other day, someone will come again to say someone died here.
if I go on staying here,
I would get mad one day!
okay, we can move out any time.
just as you like.
but how about this thing?
it's huge, I must finish it first.
you took this job for me.
you told me that...
you hope me to finish my dad's statue by my own hands.
so, I must finish it before we go, right?
okay, I'll wait until it is finished.
Nite nite.
Hello, my name is Fred Lo.
why don't you talk?
too noisy! I don't want to talk.
noisy? Where?
they quarrel at home.
that's why you came here alone for fun, right?
not alone, I have got many friends here.
what did you say?
they asked me to come for fun.
how are your parents? They don't play with you, do they?
they don't care about me.
but why are you so familiar with this place?
the guy who used to live here told me.
you know? You scared my girlfriend.
I am sorry.
you don't have to say sorry to me.
you'd better say sorry to her.
why do my parents quarrel all day?
perhaps, they are not happy.
Why? Because of me?
not exactly.
actually, kids may not understand matters in adults' world.
so, you are an adult, are you happy?
I don't know.
I think, I am not happy too.
so, let's play with them, you will be happy.
this is Mimi.
he is Sai.
he is Keith.
he is Kai.
how about her?
this is Niu, this is Wai.
how about you?
me? I am Bobo.
and me?
you are...
uncle.
since her brother died one year ago,
Bobo likes to hide herself in some dark corners.
it's so good of us to have this sun bath.
mom, it's snowing!
it's snowing!
isn't it like the one you lost?
come here.
uncle, can you teach me play magic?
Mr. Lo.
Mr. Yue.
my wife made some congee, come on, try some.
it's so kind of you, thank you.
I am so sorry that my wife and girl always come to bother you.
it's okay! I think...
your daughter is so cute and nice.
my wife's got psychic problem.
sometimes, she is fine, and sometimes not.
maids can't work here.
did you take her to the doctor?
sure, but it is useless.
it's strange that, since you guys moved in,
they have acted normal.
I think, sometimes...
if you can talk to them, or have a walk with them, it may help to cure some kind of sickness.
it's good to have some chats.
but don't tempt my wife.
you look pale, are you feeling sick?
on the paper, I learnt that you almost got killed during a performance.
you're weird.
you risk your life for money.
this is not any normal person would do.
my wife and girl aren't normal.
including you...
three weird persons together, I am afraid something bad would happen.
you'd better move out.
when you want to move out, just tell me, I'll help you.
eat while it's still hot.
you must fix this well, okay?
Yes, boss.
boss...
boss...
boss, I can go.
I can go tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or, I can go now.
just don't fire me.
I've made up my mind, I just can't change it.
boss...
I have worked for you for 2 decades, I help you a lot.
well, you can lessen my pay.
I can give up the hostel.
for pension, you can pay whatever as you like.
didn't I tell you?
this is the final decision. No amendment!
you won't be that harsh to me, will you?
you mean I am harsh?
did I give you chance?
it's you who didn't treasure it.
where have you been?
I went to celebrate my friend's birthday.
I lost my diamond earring, have you found it?
and how about my necklace? Did you find it?
not yet. Go to sleep now, let's find it tomorrow.
it's weird! Why can't we find it out?
I am sure they are stolen. I wanna call the police.
I wanna call the police.
no thief at all! I sold it, okay?
you yell all day for claiming losing things.
they are gone! They are gone!
many things of mine have lost!
you were different.
help me to find them back, okay?
I beg you to find them back.
if you don't help me, I'll look for it myself.
I will look for it. I don't need you to help me.
go, go for it!
you'd better find me ajob and a house too.
Why?
because of you I lost my job.
we have to return this hostel, we must move out, understand?
so, what should we do?
where does this ring come from?
you gave me when we married.
our wedding ring is a golden one, not like this.
who gave you this?
the guy next door, he found it for me.
take it out.
take it out and return it to him.
take it out!
no...
take it out and return it to him.
No!
take it out!
no...
take it out!
mom, please save me.
let me go!
do you know what people talk about you?
they said my own son is not like me.
I said yes, I just picked him back in the street.
you don't work hard, you just learn cooking from your mom.
you're a boy!
how come you learn nothing from me?
it's good for you to learn at least one thing!
you lost my face!
how can you be my son?
you're not qualified to be my son.
I won't make the statue.
especially it is your statue!
what is talent? What is heritage?
why don't you leave it to others but me?
Why?
I don't want to be an artist.
artists are to be respected.
I don't want it.
I just want to bring happiness to people.
I want to be a magician.
so I can bring happiness to people.
I want to pop away unhappy things.
Mr. Lo, your condition is a bit... weird.
for nerves system, you've satisfactory recovery.
but for your physical condition, it seems to go worse.
for your liver and heart, I checked out sign of failure.
doctor, please try all means to save him!
we don't mind spending more money!
miss Li, you don't have to worry too much.
the key is, never let the patient work too hard or face stress.
Mr. Lo, have you experienced illusion and sleepwalking again?
Sara, this is Director Lam.
Hi, how are you?
how is the statue going?
Mr. Lam, Fred hasn't felt well in these days.
can you give me some more time?
no problem, so, send my regards to Fred please.
okay, thank you. Bye.
come down now!
didn't you remember what the doctor said?
three days, you have to hand in the statue after three days.
why are you still here?
I have no inspiration to go on.
they know I am not that kind of person who would finish on time.
for artistic creation, it's not like making toys in factory.
but you know it or not?
we can go home once you finish it.
if I say, I'd like to live here forever...
what did you say?
I don't want to live here forever.
just kidding!
why are you always like this?
Bobo, do you like this?
Yes.
let's put this on. Come on.
come on.
Bobo, are you happy to put this pretty dress on?
look at uncle!
I'll draw you a most pretty picture, okay?
so, give me a smile. Smile beautifully, okay?
good girl.
don't move.
can her distress be cured?
I think it's okay.
how do you know that?
I am the doctor, of course I know it.
right?
draw it now. Bobo is over there.
you bitch! You wanna kidnap my girl? I'll report to the police.
Mrs. Yue, relax...
Bobo went to our home, cause Fred wanted to draw a picture for her.
we just made the appointment last night, remember that?
Mrs. Yue, relax!
I am going home now! Take your time.
never come to my daughter!
miss Li.
well, for what happened this afternoon...
I made a mistake. I am sorry.
it's okay. Please take a seat.
something is bothering me. Can you help me?
yes?
do you love Fred?
sure.
he's fallen for me.
he gave me this ring.
he is so good to my girl and me.
my girl is so happy to stay with him.
and I feel happy too.
but I am married.
though we don't love each other.
I don't know what to do. Please teach me.
what do you want me to teach you?
leave him.
no way!
Why?
you're so pretty and young.
you still have many chances to look for a better guy.
but I have no chance.
would you please go home first?
let Fred decide it, okay?
I beg you...
I can't live without him. Don't take him away from me.
I hope... you to understand my feeling.
I... I understand.
I am sorry.
you think it over.
be quick.
because we don't have much time.
we don't have much time left.
Fred, are you going to stop making the statue?
can you ask Lam to give me more time?
how long?
I don't know. Please don't ask.
I started to regret.
I regret to ask Lam to let you make your father's statue.
you... tell him.
I will make a good one, I will finish it.
Really?
you want to finish it?
do you want to live here forever?
what did you say?
I did nothing! I just pulled it.
come on.
give it to mom.
why this happen?
what are you doing here?
I came to teach Bobo magic.
what time is it now?
I am sorry, I'd better go.
never come to my house again!
we haven't learnt that yet.
shut up!
why are you so stupid to take a man home?
this is my house, I am your husband.
can you hear me?
never see him again, Bobo can't see him either.
if you were unfaithful to me, I'd kill you!
you two are nuts!
have you had enough?
if you didn't steal my things, how come I got sick?
I remember that! It's you!
you stole everything from me! Where is my hat?
give me back my hat!
give it back. - Enough!
you didn't lose anything, you just imagined that!
I didn't lie.
when will you wake up?
no, you stole my things.
I didn't.
give me back my stuff.
give it back. - Get lost!
you thief! Return my stuff to me.
that's enough! You are crazy!
what are you doing?
is that me?
you can be a magician.
you know playing tricks.
take my advice, ask someone to do it for you.
so you can finish it on time.
you just haven't listened to me!
what should I do?
what should I do?
I can't die.
if I die, what will happen to Bobo?
Bobo...
Bobo...
mom...
let's go home.
let's go, I must cook.
let' s go home for cooking.
Yes, I am coming.
what do you want this time?
ask your hubby.
ask him not to be Romeo anymore.
I don't know what he did to my wife.
if you don't move out, I am sure something bad will happen.
do you think I like living here?
I tell you, you're wrong.
I have had enough,
I don't want to see you guys either.
you get out.
so, Fred doesn't want to leave and want to flirt with my wife, huh?
please don't say that.
before having proofs, please stop assumptions.
listen, if you can't make Fred go,
you can go.
so, you'll stay out of what will happen.
I really don't understand.
isn't it real hard to make his father's statue?
well, I think he has given himself too much pressure.
director Lam, can you tell me...
how did Fred stay with his father?
Fred is a bit rebellious.
so he hasn't had good relationship with his dad.
his father treated us students as his sons.
but to Fred, that's totally different.
I can tell Fred's childhood wasn't a happy one.
that's the point! He couldn't get rid of the shadow of his dad.
I think so.
I thought he could take a good rest after moving to a new place.
but now, I have found a gap between us.
he has always been inattentive.
I am not sure what he is thinking about.
in this case,
I suggest you move back at once.
about the statue, just leave it to us.
Mr. Lo.
good morning.
good morning, Mr. Yue.
you look so good!
fine! Thank you.
now you have two choices.
either move out now...
but I tell you, you can't tell me to move out.
or, we'll call the police.
the worst thing to me is to be sued.
my wife will be locked up in the mad house,
and your house will be on fire and your wife will be raped.
I am not kidding.
help!
Sara...
Sara...
so you have come home!
come on, dance with me.
what's up with you? You are inattentive!
come on, just the two of us.
no one would harass us here.
smell it.
does the perfume smell good?
we bought it when we had our honeymoon in France.
I've just found a good excuse to start spraying
am I pretty?
I haven't made up for ages, like it?
we need music to dance, let me get some.
don't go.
don't go, come chat with me.
from your eyes,
you seem to have an odd feeling, why?
tell me, where is Sara?
stop searching for her.
you are Pinky Mong, you are Mrs. Yue.
tell me, where have you hidden Sara?
no, I am not Pinky.
come on, let's enjoy our world of two. Come on.
come on, dance with me.
come on.
why are you here?
what time is it now?
leave us alone.
okay, but not before killing him!
dare you do so! You want to kill? Go ahead...
Fred!
let me go, I wanna kill her...
mom, don't do that.
mom, don't do that! I am scared!
mom, I am scared!
mom...
Bobo...
Fred.
Fred.
Mr. and Mrs. Yue have got satisfactory recovery.
they can be discharged next month.
Mr. Lo, haven't you got illusion and sleepwalking again?
not again. Thank you, doctor.
good, see you then.
mom, I visited dad this day.
does he look good?
he looks thin, but he is so nice.
Really?
so you must work hard too, okay?
Yes, mom.
they said dad can be discharged and go home soon.
finally we can go for a vacation.
a vacation? What is it?
I don't have any idea. Why a vacation?
the best place to meet a guy is the supermarket.
you see a guy holding a list, you know he's married.
he's in the frozen-food section carrying a small basket, he's single.
I hang out by fruits and vegetables. Better chance of getting a guy who's healthy.
probably the best place is Home Depot or any hardware store.
you just walk up to the cutest guy and say:
do you know where I can get nailed? I mean, nails?
pardon me, I've been drinking all afternoon.
and that way he knows, one, that you're easy...
...and two, that you like to drink.
I thought a great place to meet girls would be night school where they teach English.
because these girls would be from foreign lands...
...and maybe still a little disoriented from the journey...
...and I would look attractive because I speak English very goodly.
but in the end, it did not work out as I had hoped.
I mean, basically, I was told to take a hike in 14 languages.
where do you meet people? I don't know, they're everywhere.
why, is there a problem?
no. No way, I'm not going out with this guy.
just call him. Say hello. He's in my book club.
why is there a woman here? - It's his wife.
they're separated, but he didn't want to Photoshop her out...
...if you're not interested. They are in Hawaii.
it's the Four Seasons. This could be you in the photograph.
Aloha.
well, if you change your mind. - I've got a picture too.
is that why you're all here? The whole family?
everyone has a picture for me? - This is an intervention, Sarah.
he's great. - A beautiful girl like you can't just give up.
there's life after divorce.
you were married to the same woman for 45 years, Dad.
what do you know about divorce? - Precious little, I admit.
not helping, Dad.
I wish your mother were here, God rest her soul.
she'd know what to say. - "Put on another pot of tea."
that's what she'd say. The Irish answer to all problems.
well, it worked most of the time. - Who is this?
I have no idea, but if you're interested, I'll Google him.
is this it for food in this house, like, eight crackers?
and what are these? Are these bananas?
I think they were at one time. - I'll take one.
I guess I forgot to shop this month. - What are you gonna do, sis?
I mean, really, it's been eight months. - Dad's giving-up idea sounds intriguing.
I could become the crazy aunt who moves in down in the basement.
put a cot in for me, some herbal teas. I'd like to get a dog, if that's okay?
Marc, don't you have a friend for Sarah?
"a Friend for Sarah." I'm now an episode of Little House on the Prairie.
come on, you must know somebody. - Not really.
but if you want to have an affair, I do know a couple of married guys.
we'll let that be our fallback, okay? - Okay.
an affair, that's a terrific idea. - My husband to the rescue.
don't cover mine.
I think affairs should go on the other side.
Yeah.
Hey, Jake.
Hey, Charlie.
divorce is final.
you're a free man.
I don't know if... is the appropriate sentiment. Four years woman I loved, I got my ass kicked. - High-five.
not that kind of moment either.
down low? - Just because I want this to stop.
you are officially the worst client I've ever had.
thank you. - Let Lisa have everything.
even the judge wanted you to keep those boxing gloves.
she really liked you. - I liked her too, as far as judges go.
no. I mean, really.
wow, that's a good-looking cougar.
excellent stuff. You think she'd like to buy a handmade, stainable teak boat?
maybe if it came with private lessons.
everybody wants all that Tupperware...
...those computer-designed, fiberglass-composite things.
I mean, don't even look like boats.
they look like boats when they whiz by your wooden guy.
that was one race, and I've made some adjustments, Charlie.
wood boats can win, trust me on that. - They can't win.
that's why people don't want them.
they can't win, but they lose beautifully.
and the whole experience is just better. Look at this.
there's a continuity at stake here, Charlie.
this is more than a boat.
this is a time machine. - If you paid this much attention to Lisa...
...You'd still be together. - This is true.
but you know what? If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't.
I wouldn't. Lisa taught me about sadness...
...About human frailty...
...and how unbearably fleeting happiness can be.
I'm gonna owe her for the rest of my life. - Oh, you'll be paying. Monthly.
hope you don't mind that I brought Mother Teresa.
are you kidding? I love this girl. Mother Teresa, do you have a friend for me?
Hey, is everything all right at home?
Yeah, Jennifer just gets tired of all the family gatherings.
too many old stories. It makes her feel left out.
Yeah. Kevin used to say that.
I still say it. - I say it too.
it seems hard now, Sarah, I know...
...but you get a chance to make a new life for yourself.
thank you, but in the marketplace of available women...
any guy would be lucky to get you. You're smart, you're funny...
...Even pretty when you're not wallowing in self-pity.
am I wallowing? Really?
you're not the wallower in the family. Carol is the wallower.
me? I never wallow. I suffer in silence.
no, that's Christine. - Thank you, Michael.
no, no.
Sylvia Plath. - This is why people...
...don't have large families anymore.
Bye. I love you. - Bye.
Bye, Bill. - Love you, Carol.
see you, Dad. - Thank you, I think.
Bye, Chris. Bye.
see you later, Dad. - Bye, Daddy.
Bye.
there's someone special waiting for you, Sarah.
I know it. Someone worthy.
Kevin was not, on his best day...
...Good enough for you, sweetheart.
now you tell me.
why not?
you know I love you and I love Lisa, but I think you're both better off.
we sure weren't making each other happy there at the end.
or the beginning.
or the middle.
I mean, don't get me wrong, we all wanted to sleep with Lisa, but marriage...
that's not right. - I said that out loud, didn't I?
you did. - I better strike that from the record.
no, lawyers get to do that. I'm instructing you to disregard that.
I think women have the whole thing planned.
really, the whole thing.
an epic narrative in their heads. You know my theory about this?
when you meet, they have the whole story written.
but you don't get to read it.
but if you go off script...
...right? They write you out of the story.
I got written out of Act 3.
now you're in Act 4, where I get you banged every night of the week.
Charlie, I'm toast. I just got shredded. I am...
it's time, healing time. I'm on the bench. - Hey. Hey.
I'm out of the game. Bench me, bench me.
Hey. - Benched.
I'll be right with you.
Hi. Can I help you? - Single chicken breast, please.
for an extra 75 cents, you can get the whole fryer here.
two breasts, two thighs and a wing.
thank you. I don't know when I'd eat all that.
it's just an extra 75 cents. - It's not the 75 cents.
I hate to see food go bad.
we got a hundred recipes. You can cook them, freeze them and...
look, listen to me, mister. I'm divorced, okay?
I eat alone, usually standing over the sink.
I don't want chicken hanging around, okay?
okay. - Thank you.
Hey. There she is.
good morning. How are you? - Good morning.
I called you last night to see if you were up for a movie...
...or bowling or group shampooing. - I'm sorry. Eric's parents are in town.
Mr. and Mrs. Stalin. I'm under house arrest.
weren't they just here? - Thank you.
I don't know why they can't stay at a hotel. Nothing I do makes them happy.
and they make Eric so nervous, he's like the Tin Man.
you have to hang in there, Leo. You and Eric are my model...
...for a successful relationship. - I fear for you, child.
anyone have anything exciting happen this weekend to share?
my uncle Mike slept over.
uncles and aunts are very important to us, aren't they?
he's not really my uncle, but my mommy makes me call him that.
when he's there, I can't sleep with my mommy because he's in her bed.
anyone else have anything they'd like to share?
Yes, Austin.
my parents are trying it apart for a while.
we have a theme, June. - Yes, we do.
and Mom says my dad is incorrigible. That means he likes other women.
good.
one, two.
let me try.
that's a hop.
one, two, that's a new step. Very good.
Molly, you wanna try the sticks? - Yeah, come on, Molly.
very good. Keep it going like that.
watch. - No, I'm doing it.
Austin!
good Lord, it's a gusher.
let me see your teeth.
Hey, Bubba. - Look who's here.
daddy!
are you all right? - Yep, I'm fine.
he had a decent bloody nose for a while, but he's fine now.
you didn't have to rush right over. - A kid bleeds, I show up. It's house rules.
you wanna get your stuff together now? - Yeah.
then I need a minute alone with Ms. Nolan. - Okay. Bye, Ms. Nolan.
Bye.
no. No. No.
so, Ms. Nolan...
Sarah, please. - And I'm Bob.
actually, everybody calls me Bobby.
I've been trying to change it since third grade.
I'm a pushover for Bobbys...
...ever since my first boyfriend, Bobby Healy, just...
you know?
I forget, is it "always discuss your personal history with parents" or "never discuss"?
it's "always discuss." Besides, I find it comforting.
so has Austin told you anything about...?
about you and... - Yeah.
that you're taking a break from your marriage and you're incorrigible.
that phrasing came from his mother.
I wouldn't have put it that way, but... - I'm sorry.
if there's anything you think I need to know, tell me.
I will. - Sometimes with Austin, you can forget.
because he seems so mature. - I know.
the other day he asked about my retirement plan.
well, he cares about you, and he wants you to be financially secure.
you know Austin adores you. I can see why.
thank you, Bob. - I might prefer Bobby after all.
I mean, I like the... I like the history.
two guys alone in the afternoon watching Doctor Zhivago.
there's something gravely wrong here. - It's all there, man.
the yearning, the suffering, a woman you'll pursue...
...through blizzards, across continents.
a love so real, even after you're dead it still hurts.
that's all I want. - You need to get out.
you do. You need to see real people. - You wanna watch it again?
no. I want to go out. Come on, I previewed some Internet ads for us.
internet ads? Come on, I want Zhivago's Internet ad:
tragic doctor/poet in desperate pain seeks...
...Lke-minded playmate for long snowshoe across Eurasia.
what do you bet he gets a hundred responses?
we'll start with bisexual Asian women who fly-fish.
no Internet ads. - This is for you. I hate to fly-fish.
no, you don't. - What about Sherry?
I gave you her number. You never called. - Sherry?
sherry's 24. Her range of interest extends from kickboxing to Tae Bo.
she slept with half the guys in my office.
then why do you want to set me up with her?
she slept with half the guys in my office.
she's in her early 20s. You know the epic narrative I talked about?
hers would not only be secret, it would be incoherent.
I wouldn't get past the cover page.
I mean, I'm looking for something more than Sherry.
hopelessly romantic, young 50s widower...
...Seeks lady friend who enjoys the slow bloom of affection.
loves dogs, children and long, meandering bike rides.
I will be carrying a single yellow rose.
I gotta meet this guy. - Where are your boob shirts?
my what? - Your boob shirts.
don't worry, I brought some of mine. - Oh, boob shirts.
I can't wear that. - Okay, I have some dating tips for you.
I got them from Sports Illustrated. Solid gold.
Yes, that's always been my bible for personal relationships.
at least listen to the tips.
your sister has gone to a lot of trouble. - Okay.
one, maintain eye contact.
but be sure it isn't too intense. You aren't a hawk eyeing its prey.
good that you told me. I might have done my hawk thing.
two, men respond sexually when they think women are excited by them.
Really? - "The more you like what you see...
...the more your pupils will open wide to take it all in."
open your pupils.
Oh, my God.
I'm dating again. I can't do this! - It's okay. Come on.
no, you'll be fine, it's okay. - It'll be fun.
what if he wants to have sex? What if I want to?
you don't understand. It's been a long time, Christine. I could freak out.
what if I can't control myself?
you're meeting for muffins in a public place. I think you'll be safe.
dad? - Sarah.
my darling girl.
darling, don't you put the sunshine to shame.
what are you doing here?
that's a fine how-do-you-do from one of my favorite daughters.
I'm sorry, it's just that I'm meeting a... why do you have a yellow...?
is that a rose? - It is a rose, if the truth be told.
but by any other name...
and it's for a lady friend, isn't it? - That is, in fact, the very purpose.
No! - Now, Sarah, come on.
it is a natural course of this life that your dad would have a lady friend by now.
I feel your mother whispering her approval to me every day.
and would this lady friend be someone who might enjoy...
...the slow bloom of affection, perhaps?
that would be grand, yes.
I'm your date, Dad.
I am. I answered my own father's personal ad.
don't laugh. It's not funny!
it shows I brought you up to know the diamond from the riffraff.
a young 50, Dad? You're 71.
and when was the last time you rode a bike?
meandering or any other way? - Well, think of it as poetry, darling.
as who I am in the bottom of my soul.
and, Sarah, my darling.
what? - I'm glad you've started dating again.
dad, please. This is disturbing on so many levels.
at least let me have the rose. - I can't.
I'm seeing someone else at 4: 00.
hello. You've reached Sarah Nolan. Leave a message if you want to.
Sarah, it's me, Christine. Pick up.
come on, Sarah, I already talked to Dad.
who else knows? - No one.
come on, Carol has to know.
why does Carol have to know? Couldn't I once know something before she does?
she's there with you, isn't she?
no. - Hello, Carol.
Hi, Sarah. I was telling Chris it's a shame I didn't know about this before...
...because I could have called Uncle Chet. We could have doubled.
this story is going to be immortalized into family history, isn't it?
told and retold at Thanksgiving dinner, year after year.
Oh, not just Thanksgiving. I think it's a good Christmas story too.
Bye, guys. - Wait.
tell the truth. On a scale of one to 10, how would you rate Dad as a date?
hot, super hot?
don't be mad at me for this, okay?
the last time you said that to me you stole my boyfriend. Danny Shea.
I did not steal Danny Shea.
I haven't forgiven you, by the way. - Stop. He was a terrible kisser.
he kissed just fine with me. - Okay. Here goes.
I went online, pretended I was you...
...and put your profile on PerfectMatch. Com.
you're making this up.
you can't just sit back and passively answer...
...Other people's ads anymore. We are on offense.
well, forgive me if I'm a tad gun-shy after my last date with my father.
come on, at least look at your profile.
that's my high school graduation picture.
that's all I had. That or your wedding photo.
"voluptuous"? Carol!
every woman listed claims to be at least voluptuous.
some are "gorgeous inside and out," most are "sexually confident."
voluptuous, sensuous DwF seeks special man to share starlit nights.
"must love dogs." - I put that in for you.
and yet I'm still pissed.
I must have done something right. You have 18 responses.
you listened to them, didn't you?
I like three, 11 and 14. Christine likes two and eight.
michael liked them all. But you decide for yourself.
what do you mean by voluptuous? Do you mean big breasts...
...or do you mean fat?
I love dogs too.
I have a great sense of humor, but you could probably already tell that.
yo.
my name is Walter Taylor. I'm an attorney.
don't hang up. I like opera. Don't delete me.
so anyway, I get all dressed up...
...and I walk down the stairs and I see...
...my father sitting there holding a single yellow rose.
and it dawns on me...
is something wrong? - Well, no offense, it's just...
I thought you'd be younger, that's all.
well, you said your age range was 25 to 45.
I guess I was hoping more for 25.
eighteen. That's legal.
it's nice to be out.
I've been feeling kind of blue lately.
I know, you mentioned on the phone, Lennie, that you've... kind of depressed.
did I cry? - Well, a little bit.
I've been on 17 first dates this year.
no second dates.
one went...
...to check her coat and never came back.
one jumped out at the light when it changed.
well, we're almost through the salad. That's a good sign.
no.
Lennie.
please. Don't.
please. Lennie. No.
if you're happy and you know it clap your hands come on! If you're happy.
and you know it clap your hands. Oh, God!
come on, get up. Get her. Get her.
damn.
don't be upset. I come from a large family.
lots of male cousins, brothers. Used to this sort of thing.
three out of five.
Oh, that's all right. Maybe later. - Come on.
your table's almost ready. - Good. We're working up an appetite.
food here is fabulous. It's not cheap, though.
well, I offered to pay my half.
and what did I tell you?
Marshall's girls don't pay.
beautiful.
you'd look really good in handcuffs.
Charlie, my boy, some nice-looking pieces here.
Really? I didn't see anyone. - I meant the artwork.
bet this cost a bundle. - Hey, guys.
Hi! - Speaking of artwork.
Hi, Sherry. - Hi, Charlie. Hi, Jake.
how are you? Let's do two.
that's how they do it in France. - You having fun?
well, I feel sorry for the artist at these things.
all this talent on display, and everybody here's just trying to get laid.
I know I am.
you never called me, mister. I waited and waited.
I know I am.
I'm sorry, Sherry, it's just that I'm not ready right now to be in a serious relationship.
and with somebody as wonderful and as beautiful as you...
...I just wouldn't expect anything less.
why can't you be sweet like that, huh? - Sherry!
Hey, guys. - Short attention span.
you're a sick guy, you know that?
just another in a long line of colossal mistakes.
I'm not answering an Internet ad.
look at this. "Voluptuous and sensuous. Must love dogs." wonderful.
look at the picture.
well, she is appealing.
she'll be good-looking when she grows up.
I'm surfing porn sites like always...
...I keep getting kicked over to PerfectMatch. Com...
...which is not where I want to be...
...and this girl's profile keeps repeating, like a sign from heaven. And I thought of you.
tell the prom queen thanks, but no. I'm still benched.
too late. You're meeting her at 11. Bring a dog.
no, I'm not.
it's okay.
stop that growling!
use your words.
stop, sit.
stop, sit.
stop. Sit. - I don't think he knows "stop" or "sit."
what else have you got? - Bruno, focus.
roll over and play dead.
Hey, look at that. Look at that. - That's very impressive.
you Sarah? - Jake.
Yeah, hi. - Yeah. Hi.
I didn't recognize you without the cap and gown.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. - Yeah.
this is really amazing. - Yeah.
it is. When he plays dead, he really plays dead.
you don't know the half of it. He can stop his heart like a Sufi mystic.
does he sleep on a doggy bed of nails? - As a matter of fact, he does.
he feels nothing. Or perhaps he feels too much.
I think he wants his treat now. - You think so?
while he's playing dead? It might ruin the effect.
I don't know. He's your dog. - He's not. He's my friend Charlie's.
so you're here under false pretenses. - No, not at all.
you said "must love dogs," not "must own dogs." I do love dogs.
in fact, I had one with my ex.
she was allergic, went into anaphylactic shock.
so we had to put her down. Dog.
not the wife. I'm kidding about both.
this is a beautiful canine you have here.
Hi. - Yes, this is Mother Teresa.
Yeah, she plays with lepers?
comforts the poor? Yeah. How long you had her?
technically, she's not really mine. She's my brother's.
I'm shocked and saddened.
false pretenses. - Well, we are related. She's family.
and I do really love dogs, and my ex was allergic also.
Yes, he often had "anaphyphlectic" shock.
you're making that up.
Yes, I am. - Me too.
tell me, I'm just curious about one thing.
why did you write "voluptuous"?
Oh, my... - No! I did not mean to be rude at all.
it's just that voluptuous, that tends to go the other way...
...when someone uses that phrase.
towards the full-figured end of the spectrum.
I didn't know there was a full-figured spectrum.
it's one of those words they use in personal ads...
...like "Rubenesque" or "weight proportionate to height."
Hey, it's your ad. You can say whatever you want, I'm...
just for the record, girl says "athletic," she means "flat-chested." which you're not.
but... This isn't coming out right.
look, you know, I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm a little nervous. I'm not used to meeting people this way.
Really? You seem very practiced and smooth.
your ad doesn't do you justice. - Well, maybe you should rewrite my ad.
well, maybe I don't want to. - And why not?
because maybe I don't want anyone else to answer it.
did you plan on saying that sometime today?
no, I didn't. But it's good, isn't it? - It is good.
it's a good line. - Maybe we should try this over again.
Hi, I'm Jake.
Sarah.
so why would you even write an ad? You don't seem that desperate.
why would you answer one? Talk about desperate.
I'm not. I mean, I didn't. It was my friend's. He gave it to me.
I didn't write it. My sister did. - Your sister's ad.
your brother's dog. Those your shoes?
Oh, my. Look at the time! Come on, honey.
what I'm trying to say is I'd like to get to know you.
I have to get this dog home,
maybe we could try this another time. You know, without the dogs.
you bet.
I'll call you.
Sarah, for the record...
...you are kind of voluptuous in a minimalist sort of way.
I'm not sure I'm up for this dinner at dad's new girlfriend's house.
he seems really excited about her. - Where are Marc and Jason?
they took the kids to Magic Mountain.
the kids didn't even really want to go. The dads whined.
well, they're so spoiled, those dads.
so how was your day today? At the dog park?
how did you know about that? - Who do you think you're dealing with?
you're good. I have to give you that. - So come on.
tell me. - Okay.
we got off to kind of a rough start. But then it was okay, you know?
he was a little intense. He was nervous. He couldn't stop insulting me.
you know what this sounds like.
no, it's not. Don't say it. - But it is. It's a growth opportunity.
I'm not over my last growth opportunity when you stole Danny Shea.
will you forget Danny Shea? He's probably a convicted felon by now, divorced.
maybe you should call him. - Carol.
what about that guy you met at preschool? You maimed his kid?
Bob connor. - Yeah. Mr. Incorrigible.
I told you, I can't. He's the father of one of my students.
Yes, honey, but he's not your father. That's a big step forward for you.
bill. - Dolly.
Hey!
what a lovely home you have, Dolly. - Thank you.
when my third husband died, I decided to give up the big house.
third out of how many?
and these potholders?
where did you manage to find them?
why, everything in this house is handmade by Dolly.
Oh, yes. She's very creative.
our mother used to sew all our clothes when we were younger.
Sarah. - Well, she did.
your father told me all about your mother, honey.
she must have been a very special lady.
she was. - And you must miss her very much.
I do. - And you see me...
...as something of an interloper, I suppose.
do you want me to lie down for this?
we're at interloping? When did that happen?
it's dad's life. I don't meddle.
Carol, you meddle in my life all the time.
well, technically that's not true, because you don't have a life.
I happen to have a very full life.
did you even check all of your messages?
I thought a few were very promising.
like who? - Like the engineer from Oxnard.
with the sexual dysfunction. - In what way would he be promising?
you could cure him. The whole nurse-patient thing.
you've got it all worked out. - It was brave of him to be so forthcoming.
why don't you call him, then. - Why don't you.
call! I'll give you his number. - Maybe I will.
go for it. - Okay.
hey there. Ms. Nolan.
what are you doing yelling in whispering Breeze Park?
look who it is.
what a surprise. - Oh, hi, Ms. Nolan. How are you?
Hi, sweetie. - Who's that?
Oh, this is my sister Carol. - Nice to meet you.
this is Austin, my student, and his dad, Mr. Connor. Bob.
actually, I go by Bobby now.
right. You live here?
Yeah, they cater to the recently separated and divorced.
but I'm the youngest guy here by 40 years, so it's good for my morale.
my wife and I are gonna try it apart. - I know.
will you just look at her, son?
is my little girl lovely or is my little girl lovely?
Oh, dad, don't worry about embarrassing me.
stop it, Bill. She is cute as a button, though.
so, what is it you do, Bobby? Sarah never tells us about her beaus.
I'm finishing my Ph. D. in American history.
a biography of Robert E. Lee. - I always felt sorry for Lee.
forced to fight against his old friends and West Point classmates.
could only dress in gray. Sad.
she's funny too. A complete package, you know.
when I need extra money, I work construction.
well, it sounds very manly. Do you wear a hardhat?
Sarah was the one who always had the boys knocking at the door.
Oh, dad. - She had eyes only for that singer.
what was his name? Thin fellow.
looked like a girl. - Mick Jagger.
no, no. Sarah was saving herself for David Cassidy.
like you weren't.
Carol wasn't saving herself for anybody. - What?
I remember now. It was David Cassidy of The Pheasant Family.
bill. Bill, honey.
partridge Family. You know, I saw him last year in Vegas.
he was good. Hadn't changed a bit. Same turtleneck.
Sarah had the whole Partridge act down.
she'd put on the little miniskirt, the go-go boots...
...and pretend she was Susan Dey.
this is all a lie. - Sing the theme song, Sarah.
don't make me kill you, Carol. - You remember the intro.
no. - Come on.
come on.
Oh, that was what he told you.
it was a great night. - Great night.
I forgot how much fun those humiliating family sing-alongs can be.
can I say one thing about Mr. Incorrigible?
only if you sing it. - He is hot. And he likes you.
I can't. It's just my luck. He's the father of one of my students.
he has a Ph. D. and a great ass. Let's not get dragged down by ethics.
technically, he doesn't have his Ph. D. yet.
but yes, the ass thing, I know. - God, let's not even mention the eyes.
the crinkly smile. - No. That would be wrong.
so can I ask you a question? - No.
you never would have left Kevin. Would you?
if he hadn't left me? No, I don't think so.
but you weren't really happy.
well, I figured that was the life I picked, so I had to make the most of it.
I'm not even sure I deserve a new life now.
sometimes I think that was supposed to be my one chance and I blew it.
where did we get these bad attitudes, you think?
the nuns? - Yeah, that works.
let's blame the nuns. Can I say one more thing?
you love me. I know.
I do.
I mean, I was really bad. She did not see my A game.
sounds like she didn't see your B or c game.
I'm gonna call her again. I want to ask her out. I need a mulligan.
dog threw me. I mean, the sun was in my eyes.
pick someone else, start over.
no, this girl, there's something special about this girl.
you know the expression "she took my breath away"?
I mean, she did. I actually gasped. I'm off the bench, man.
think she'll see you again? I wouldn't.
you're not nice. Like, you're not a nice person.
Hi, June. - Hey, June.
Hi, June. - Hey, June.
need more cupcakes. All the dads are staying for the party.
what's up with that? - I have no idea.
every Halloween it's the same thing.
but I guess it's great how involved they are in their kids' world. Isn't it?
Yeah. - Yeah.
why don't you and Eric come over.
I'll rent a hopelessly romantic movie. We can all hold hands together and cry.
sounds fun, but we can't.
it's our anniversary, and we always spend it just the two of us.
sweet.
seven years ago tonight, we met at my parents' house.
they were trying to fix Eric up with my sister.
sorry we're late.
Austin drives so slow.
I hope my family wasn't embarrassing last night.
Oh, no. Not at all. They do seem a little bit involved in your life.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Austin's mom's from a large family.
that's a lot of people that don't speak to me.
thimbleful of juice? - Sure. But just one.
to good teachers. - To good dads.
to good teachers who are also very beautiful.
to good dads who are dangerously cute and charming.
there you go.
there's an attraction here, Sarah. You can't deny it.
I'm not. I'm trying to ignore it. - Why?
well, for one, Austin is my student.
two, we're in the puppet closet.
couldn't we go out in the real world? - I'm not so good in the real world.
I was looking at the handbook, under "dating, parents and teachers."
nothing. There's nothing there. - Sarah.
we need the emergency pants. It's an emergency.
emergency pants. Come on, sweetie.
Hey, babe, my name is Ron.
mid-40s, handsome, totally toned, 5'7," 161 pounds...
...Give or take a piece of pizza.
no, I'm not kidding. I'm totally toned. Call me, you won't be sorry.
Hi, Sarah, it's Lennie.
I had a wonderful time, and I'm...
I'll call back.
Hi, Sarah? It's Jake Anderson, the idiot from the dog park.
actually, that was all a test to see how you respond...
...to crazy people, and you passed.
so maybe we could see each other again.
what do you say? You want to give me another chance?
I had a couple of icebreakers.
I even had a few stories for you, anecdotes, but I forgot them all.
I think it might be that dress. - My sister Carol made me buy it.
I love Carol.
well, this is a very charming place. - Yeah.
good food? - No, not particularly.
but I like the ambiance.
I come here because I know the owners, the Parseghians, that couple over there.
see? They're waving. - They want us to join them.
a few years ago,
...I forswore ethnic folk dancing, so...
they'll come over and say hello and maybe... How are you? Hi!
how are you? - Hello.
nice, right?
Sarah, Mr. and Mrs. Parseghian. - Hello.
welcome, Sarah. - Thank you.
see you later. We'll drink.
Absolutely. - Okay.
you speak Armenian. - A little bit.
well, what did you say?
I asked him, "where is the youth hostel?" It's all I remember.
kind of a joke we have.
what is it that you do, exactly?
God, no wonder I live alone.
I build boats.
you know, these handcrafted wooden sculls...
...Rowing. The racing ones. - Yeah. Really?
Yeah. Yep.
does anyone buy those? - Nope. Not yet.
everybody wants all these high-tech...
...Fiberglass, you know, no turbulence.
Where's the fun in that ride? I don't know.
but they'll come around. - Don't count on me. I get seasick.
in the bathtub. - Really?
Yeah.
you know what? Can we just skip all the small talk?
what? - Can we skip the small talk? Just skip it?
you know, like, who are you? Who am I?
what are we doing here together?
I have this theory that when you first meet somebody...
...that's the time when you have to be totally honest...
...because you have nothing to lose.
five, 10 years down the road, gets a lot harder.
you can't say one day, "Happy anniversary, this is me."
it doesn't work that way. This is it.
we'll never see each other as clearly and as nakedly as we do in this moment.
right now. This instant. I'm really scaring you right now, aren't I?
just a little bit. Yeah.
but, you know, on the one hand...
...you're very charming and interesting and you have a lot of energy.
you know, on the other hand, a little bit scary.
okay.
here's my story. Here's what you need to know.
okay.
I'm just divorced, and I had my heart broken badly...
...By a woman that I really loved.
you know, but I think your heart grows back bigger.
you know? Once you've got the shit beat out of you.
and the universe lets your heart expand that way.
I think that's the function of all this pain and heartache that we all go through.
you gotta go through that to come out to a better place. And that's how I see it.
what about you? Why is a dazzling woman like you single?
you can do it. You can just tell the truth.
if you know the truth. What have we got to lose?
after the dinner we shake hands, "good night," never see each other again.
all right.
he stopped loving me.
I don't know what I did or what I didn't do.
he just stopped.
I don't think I've ever said that out loud before.
see, we just had an honest moment.
now we can sit back and enjoy our food...
...and get to know each other. I'm Jake.
condom? - You don't have one?
why would I have one? - For occasions like this.
there haven't been any occasions like this.
you didn't bring one? - I didn't want to jinx it.
this preschool of yours, it's traditional? Developmental?
montessori? - Yeah, yeah. All that. Drugstore!
there's a Rite Aid on 93rd. Hang a left.
should I take the freeway? - Please turn left!
is this the fastest you can go? - I could go faster, but we'd lift off.
you drive. - All right.
for big ones, you need five, six coats of varnish.
for the singles, it's a little bit different.
there's one right there. Jackpot!
they're out!
how can they be out? - I don't know.
but I have a theory.
everybody in the whole city is having sex...
...At the exact same moment except us.
but we will press on.
what's wrong?
well, the magic is gone a little.
okay.
I mean, l... - No, no, I understand totally.
look, you know. There's other things we can do.
I'd be happy just to stay with you and look at you all night.
Yeah, I haven't done this in a while. And...
and now you don't want to. - Yeah.
Yeah. - Yeah.
that's all right. If the magic's gone, that implies there was once magic.
not bad for a first date.
second date. - Second date. This is great.
I had a great time. - Me too.
so...
...Good night.
you still have to drive me home, though. - Right. Because you don't live here.
don't worry, it's just me. I'm in the kitchen. Filled your freezer again.
there's now enough meat to feed every guy...
...who answered your ad and still...
Jake Anderson, my sister Carol. - Hi.
Hi. - Jake did, in fact, answer the ad.
do I get my meat?
thank you.
sorry to scare him away.
it's okay. I think we both realized it wasn't going to happen tonight.
what's the matter? He's so cute.
I don't know. We had a great night. Laughing, really talking.
you had a guy talking and you let him escape?
I'm not sure I actually understood a lot of what he said.
doesn't matter. He spoke.
and are we talking full sentences here or just grunting?
he's quite emotional. I know more about him than Kevin.
an emotional man who likes to talk.
this is a mythical figure, Sarah. - I don't think I'm ready for him.
he's looking for the whole dance and I'm just relearning the steps.
what happened exactly? Come on, tell me.
leave nothing out. - Okay.
we really connected at the restaurant, like I said.
but then, where do you go from there? How much baba ganoush can you have?
then we started making out, which was like being in 11 th grade.
then neither one of us had a condom, which I think reflects some ambivalence.
I'm just not cut out for this. Life in the fast lane.
fast lane? You're not even on the on-ramp.
but these people seem happy. - Of course they do. They have a condom.
marc and I couldn't find a condom once. Wanna know what we used?
no. - Saran wrap.
thanks for that image which will stay in my brain for the rest of my life.
it was sexy in a Good Housekeeping kind of way.
I'll never be able to wrap leftovers again.
did it work? - Maeve was born nine months and one day later.
I don't wanna just do random dating, Carol. I wanna be in love.
I wanna wake up next to someone and see them smile.
do the whole Sunday breakfast thing, go out and get the paper.
stay in bed together all day.
wouldn't we all?
man, this is absolutely gorgeous. I love this. I can't believe you built it yourself.
Yeah, handcrafted. Hand-carved.
I hope you'll find that it's more than a boat.
it's a time machine.
I love it. I want it. I'll take it. - Great.
did you race a lot in college?
I don't plan to race it. Could you cut it in half for me?
excuse me? - Yeah, cut it in half lengthwise.
I think it would be easier to mount on the wall that way.
you want to mount the boat?
Yeah. I thought I'd put it in the den. It'd look great above my big screen.
you know, I think maybe you should go to IKEA and buy a canoe.
it's not for sale in that way.
he's kidding, right? - Wouldn't that be nice.
I've had this dream that it'll end up wet.
it's just not for sale in that way at this time. Ever, really.
okay. Well, if you change your mind, I really do want it.
Yeah, if I change my personality, I'll let you know what I become.
okay. - Thanks so much.
nice guy. - Stanley owes me a big favor.
it was a guaranteed sale. - So what?
right. You can afford to be picky. You sold...
...let's see, no boats. No boats at all.
you worry too much. You really do.
you're in a good mood. That must have been some date.
Charlie, you should have seen this girl.
she's shy, she's fragile, she's self-conscious.
she has no idea how beautiful she is. She's a mess. It's fantastic.
the evening didn't end up great, but there were moments in there...
...where we were completely and utterly ourselves.
I was completely psychotic, but she was completely lovely.
are you thinking about completely closing the sale any time soon?
I tell you about a night with an unusual woman...
...and you turn it into a business transaction.
we're not selling real estate here.
and if we were selling real estate? - We'd be in escrow this weekend.
I see dad's not alone.
never. Not our dad.
I'm not calling any of them mom, I'll tell you that.
what is the new one's name again? - I believe that is Marlene.
but it is one you will have to make as a rescue swimmer.
the bigger reality is, it's also something you're going to have to live with as a human being.
there will come a time when you're going to have to say no.
the most important person to keep alive is yourself.
you'll be facing crews from five to 20, all saying, " Save me, save me. "
they're looking for a miracle.
how old are you, Hodge? -Twenty-four.
at 2 4 years old, you have to become that miracle.
you have to find a way to be that miracle.
looking right, looking center, looking left.
you okay, sir? I'm a rescue swimmer.
again.
all right, that's it. Time-out.
panics every time, Senior. -Hodge, over here.
Hey.
the only difference between you and the victim is the attitude in which you enter the water.
you've gotta figure out a way to be calm in the face of chaos. Do you understand?
that's your first challenge, Charlie.
one more and you're gone.
come out. -Aye, aye, Senior Chief.
what's up, Big Fisch?
you don't have to take his shit, Hodge.
what do you know? It's so easy for you, Fischer.
is that right?
Yeah.
you know, you don't get it.
you don't realize that you're tougher than I am.
and how's that?
well, if I get kicked out of here, I'm not coming back.
I'm definitely not coming back twice.
I mean, you got guts, man.
stupidity.
how long you been here, man?
altogether... I don't know, 10 weeks the first time, -six weeks, two days the second time... -Six weeks this time.
so basically, you've been here longer than anybody that's graduated this place, but you don't think you can make it.
lighten up on yourself, man.
let's go. Let's get a beer.
Hey, wait. Don't you have a date with the girl from the wedding?
Yeah, but it's not till 9: 00. We got time. Get dressed.
let's go.
when you go under, when you're pulling on your stroke, -move your hand... -Wait a minute. Where are we going?
Jake, that's a squid bar. I mean, there's Navy guys everywhere.
I don't give a shit. A beer's a beer.
when you're pulling through the water, you're gonna pull yourself through.
like, you know... -So I'll go fast.
no, you wanna lay to your side and pull it like that.
Hey, Charlie, you get those fittings replaced -before you came off to get tanked up? -Yes, sir, Captain.
Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it.
we go to " A " School, which is the most difficult school in the military.
the attrition rate's, like... What is it, 50% ?
it's over 50% . -Over 50.
we're still here, 'cause we're the best of the best.
when storms shut down entire ports, you know who goes out?
we do.
when hurricanes... When hurricanes ground the US Navy, like these little guys over here, guess who goes out?
that's right, we do.
look, honey, you better keep it down in here, okay?
okay, honey. She called me " honey " .
okay, honey.
but when God himself reaches down from heaven...
what does he do, Jake, when he... -Rips houses off the foundation.
when God himself rips houses off the foundation, we go out, because we are rescue swimmers, and that is our job, and that's what we do.
you might wanna recheck your compass.
this ain't no puddle pirate bar.
no problem, because we were just leaving anyway.
sit down, Hodge. -Jake.
finish your beer. -Jake.
Yeah, sit, Hodge.
that's my beer, man.
finished now?
must be happy hour.
Hey!
back off.
everyone in this place is retired Navy.
Hey. Hey, when do I get that phone call?
I know I get a phone call. When do I get my phone call?
madam, I am sorry, but if nobody come in 20 minutes, I need the table.
okay. -I'm sorry.
Yeah.
she's never gonna talk to me again.
you know they're gonna kick us out for this, right?
Yep.
least they can't say we quit.
I was never gonna make it, anyway. Skinner's right. Panic every time.
man, screw Skinner.
I'm Skinner. Break my hold.
Hey, what are you doing, man? Come on, Fischer, get off me.
clock's ticking. Break it.
Fischer, you're hurting me, man. Fischer, get off me, man!
come on, Fischer, you're hurting me. Fischer, man, get off!
break the goddamn hold. -Fischer, get off me, man!
break the goddamn hold, Hodge. -Fischer, get off me!
I said, get off me!
all right.
now, it's just like that when you're in the water.
well, now. We could come back.
give you boys time for a smoke and some pillow talk.
you can't kick us out.
it's called disorderly conduct, and yes, we can.
we didn't fail at nothing. -Our profession is all about control.
you both failed miserably in that department.
hold it right there.
senior? -Yeah, come in.
their disenrollment records.
bar fight?
all right, bring them in. -Senior.
square it.
it's all my fault, Senior Chief. Hodge had nothing to do with it.
that true, Hodge? -It's true.
all right. Fine, you're dismissed.
senior Chief, I was... -I said that you are dismissed.
let's go.
you're gonna kick me out for defending the Coast Guard?
the Coast Guard's been around for 200 years.
I doubt a couple of knuckleheads like yourself are gonna defend it.
sit down.
I've been trying to peel the layers back on you for a while now, and l...
I just don't get it.
I mean, this kind of work seems a little remedial for someone like yourself.
you know, big swim champ, offer to every lvy League.
you give it all up to be here with us.
Why? -I'm here to save lives, Senior Chief.
I spoke with your coach, Jake.
you spoke with my coach? -Yeah, I spoke with your coach.
something in your file just kept hanging me up.
you win the state championship your freshman and sophomore year and then you don't swim the next two.
I'm just a public school guy, so pardon me, but it didn't add up until now.
Kirk Holloway, 100-meter medley winner, " thrown through the passenger window."
pronounced dead at the scene.
abe lkeman, first team All-American, lungs crushed.
'Carl Sandoval, 50-meter freestyle champ, " made it all the way to the hospital. Died of internal bleeding. "
I guess you just know everything, then.
I know what it's like to lose a team.
yeah?
what about living in a small town where everyone thinks that you killed their brother or their son or their best friend?
you know about that?
kind of small town where everyone still waves to everyone, just not to you?
I read the report, Jake. Your blood alcohol was zip that night.
I'm guessing there was a flip for designated driver.
you lost.
guess that just makes it all go away, huh?
no, it doesn't make it all right. It just makes it an accident.
at least that's how it reads.
you were 16 years old, Jake.
I'm not your priest, but if I was, I think...
I think maybe you'd deserve a pass.
you're giving me a pass?
you just think you know everything with your psychobabble bullshit.
why am I here? Why are you here?
you're too old to be doing this. You're washed-up here.
you don't wanna be teaching a bunch of kids in a pool. Am I right?
I don't give a shit what you read or who you talked to.
you don't know about me! You don't... I have me under control.
I can see that.
the only difference between you and me is,
I don't wear the ones I lost on my arm, Jake.
I know where you're at, Jake.
I'm there myself.
I ask myself every day why I was the one that survived.
And? -And...
and if I can't answer that for me,
I'm certainly not going to try and answer it for you.
have a seat.
I want you to start being a member of this team, the team you have now.
you have a gift, Jake.
you're the best swimmer to come through this program, hands down, by far.
you got a whole record board to prove it.
but you know what I see when I look at it?
I see someone fast enough who's gonna get there first.
I see someone strong enough who's gonna last.
I see someone who can save a life that maybe nobody else could.
you really wanna honor the initials on your arm?
then honor your gift.
save the ones you can, Jake.
the rest, we've gotta let go.
does this mean you're not gonna fail me?
for what, backing up a buddy in a bar?
man, I got bigger problems than you.
I don't know about you, but I could use a fucking drink.
I'm gonna consider everything tonight off-record and off-duty.
that was an invite.
Oh.
you gotta be kidding me.
what was it they called you? - " Puddle pirates, " but it's not...
I'm way over it, Senior Chief. This is...
well, it's like sticks and stones. -Well, we'll just have one beer.
great. They're angrier and drunker. Perfect.
Hi. Two beers.
you gotta be kidding me. -That's what I said.
look, I don't want any trouble, okay?
they really don't like us, do they?
no. They think they're better than us because they're combat-oriented.
we're the Coast Guard, Jake.
nobody really appreciates us until they need us.
that him?
Yep.
so let me ask you a question before we start bleeding.
all those saves... What's your real number?
do you have a death wish, or are you just shit-stupid?
I'm gonna go with stupid this time.
Hi. -Hi.
who's this, your old man?
you know, I'm really glad you're still here.
Oh, yeah? -Yeah.
behind you. -Stand down! I said stand down.
I think you better leave.
okay.
come on, Jake.
all right, sit down. Have a beer.
that went a lot better than I thought. -Yeah.
what the hell was that? -I don't know.
Hey, I wanted to apologize to you for what I said earlier about you being old and washed-up now.
is there anything you'd like to say to me?
like what?
I don't know, but I apologized to you.
I just thought that, you know, there might be something you've said or done that you'd like to apologize to me for.
Why?
cause that's how it's done. l...
you suck at apologies, you know that?
I mean, you're missing the whole concept.
Hello? - Hi. It's me.
are you okay? What happened? I mean, I waited for two hours.
Yeah. No. Look, I'm really sorry. l...
what happened?
it's a really long story.
let me just... Let me put it this way.
it was the best worst night of my life.
well, I'm glad someone had fun.
can I see you tomorrow night?
I have parent-teacher conferences tomorrow.
what about the next night?
I have parent-teacher conferences all week.
you blowing me off? - No, Jake.
I wouldn't do that to somebody.
I gotta get up in a couple hours. I gotta go.
Yep. -Goodbye.
all right, you know what we briefed on the ground.
same thing. We're gonna stay together.
no matter what happens out there, you stay together.
whatever decision you make, you make as a team.
we trained to freefall at 15 to 20 feet.
you fall from 50 feet, it's like hitting concrete.
you fall 80 to 100 feet, you die.
Hey, where they going?
they're supposed to come back for us, right?
I don't know. Well, Hodge, you been here before.
they're gonna come back for us, right?
Yeah, but I never made it this far.
you're kidding. -Not to the final week.
they're not coming back.
what do we do? -All right, listen up.
we stay together as a group.
nobody falls behind. We all stay together.
one guy goes back, we get him back up to the front, okay?
we're a team. Oorah.
let's do it, 5506.
sir, it's okay, I'm with the US Coast Guard.
again.
I'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer. I'm here to help you.
time-out.
class, pop tall.
Hodge, get yourself to the side of the pool.
aye, aye, Senior Chief.
easy, Chief.
guess it was a lucky punch.
Hodge!
you all right, Chief? -You stay right there!
well done, Charlie.
well done.
class 5506, " Oorah, Hodge, " on three!
good for you.
get their gear off.
go on, get that gear off. -Get that gear off!
get it off!
class 5506, will you come find me if I am lost?
Yes, Senior Chief!
will you come save me if I am drowning?
Yes, Senior Chief!
I believe you would.
I have high hopes for this class.
I have high hopes for you.
Matthew Stokes, Savannah, Georgia.
Matthew, a job well done.- Oorah, Captain.
kenneth Weatherly, Clearwater, Florida.
go out there and do great things.
william Hodge, Astoria, Oregon.
Where's Senior Chief?
he had a chance to go back to Kodiak and he took it.
he never had much of a bedside manner.
he's a water dog, Jake, and as it turns out, not a half-bad teacher.
best of luck.
jacob Fischer, Kodiak, Alaska.
congratulations, Jake. Make us proud up there.
aye, aye, Captain.
Scott Reeves, Sitka, Alaska.
ladies and gentlemen, your graduates.
Congratulations. -Thanks a lot.
good job, guys. -Good luck.
well, congratulations. -Thank you.
it's okay.
we both knew where this was going, right?
just casual.
right.
to getting what you've always wanted.
and always wanting more.
take care of yourself, Jake.
I gotta go to work. -Yeah.
Bye.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Rock.
I'm Captain William Hadley, CO of Kodiak Air Station.
Fischer. -Yeah, right here.
Mr. Mitcheltree will square you away.
the rest of you, step up here with Mr. Christiansen.
he will process you in.
Oh, amazing.
not only does he come back in great shape, but he still thinks he can cook.
Hello, Jake. Welcome. -How you doing?
good to see you again. -You guys keep it warm here, huh?
glad to know you know where a free meal is.
we need three crews in Sitka for the weekend.
you make sure that happens.
and the stand team arrives here next Tuesday.
patch things up with the wife?
you fix things up with that young lady?
well, you still have a choice, you know.
Hey, there's a question I wanted to ask you back in school and I didn't.
but when you can't save them all, how do you choose who lives?
it's probably different for everybody, Jake.
kind of simple for me, though. I just...
I take the first one I come to or the weakest one in the group, and then I swim as fast and as hard as I can for as long as I can.
and the sea takes the rest.
think I'm ready?
I'm not your teacher anymore, Jake. I'm just your fellow swimmer.
that's not exactly the answer I'm looking for there.
lf I did not think you were ready, I would not put you in the Bering Sea.
6030, this is Kodiak Ops Cent.
we are diverting your training mission at this time.
we have two young kayakers swept into the cave one mile south of Saltery Cove.
how copy? - 6030 copies.
we're diverting at this time. -We've got a real case now.
okay, guys, that tide's coming in, and we've got six- to eight-foot rollers coming from the north.
senior, what do you think about taking Fischer with you on this?
I want him with me. All right? He's good to go.
I don't think it's gonna be a problem sliding in there.
I think the problem's gonna be coming back out.
that's why I got Jake with me. Got my human speedboat.
pilot 2: Kodiak Ops, this is 6030. We're on-scene at this time.
no sign of kayakers. I'm taking her down.
cabin door is open and locked.
those are definitely ten-foot waves.
swimmer's coming to the door.
remember, all right?
you got the whole weight of the ocean punching through that opening.
you gotta read the hydraulics, gotta count the waves, then wait for the flush.
CREWMAN: Checking swimmer.
sure as hell hope you paid attention in class, Speedboat.
swimmers in the water.
swimmers okay.
swimmer Two is making contact with Swimmer One.
Hey!
over here!
here. -Over here!
got them. Three o'clock.
right here.
we're rescue swimmers. We're gonna get you out of here.
can't believe you guys actually got here.
give me your hand.
just the two of you?
Yeah, yeah. His arm's hurt real bad.
all right.
swimmer One. I got two survivors. It's gonna be a basket pickup here.
Roger.
broken here?
you take him first. Get him in the basket.
I'll follow with the other one right behind you.
you got that? -Yeah.
you got it? -Yeah, yeah.
all right. I'm gonna lower you down in here, all right?
okay. -Relax, buddy. I got you.
all right.
you're with me. -Okay.
I don't swim so good.
you don't swim so good? -No, sir.
it's okay. I swim pretty good. All right, on your back.
wait. Are we gonna take the boat? -I'm the boat.
wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not ready! I can't... -Hey!
wait, wait, wait... -Settle down!
something's not right.
swimmer One's going back to the cave.
what happened?
he hit a log.
what? What are you...
what...
he's gone, Jake. - He's not.
he's just got a head laceration.
here we go. Come on.
let's go.
let's go!
senior Chief Randall! Lock it in.
it's simple physics.
we're just gonna time the flush, all right?
all right.
you call it, Swimmer.
now!
Hey, I know you're tired, okay? I know you feel tired right now.
but you need to keep your eyes open, okay?
all right? All right? Hey, I need you to keep talking to him.
you keep talking to him. -Okay.
senior. Senior!
can you open these up for me?
one by one, I want you to hand them to me.
Reyes!
he's fine.
right here, buddy. Right here. Okay?
okay. -Right here.
woman: Robert! -I'm okay.
he's got a compound fracture in his right radius.
we tried to stabilize that a little bit.
we put a collar on this one, but it's more precautionary than anything.
thank you.
this one's possibly a little bit concussive.
we checked their vitals the whole way back.
they're both mildly hypothermic, but I think they'll come around.
thank you so much.
you're welcome.
it happens, Ben.
not to me. Not like that.
I want you to sign them in front of me.
why don't you take some time and think about it?
no. It's...
it's over. Just sign them.
please.
could've happened to anyone.
maybe.
but what if it happens again? What then?
kid got a couple stitches. He's gonna be fine.
we got him out of there.
no, you did.
you were strong out there today.
I was proud of you.
what are you gonna do?
friend of mine once suggested fishing.
think I might take his advice.
fishing?
Yeah.
guys like us don't go fishing.
where have I heard that before?
senior, before you go,
I gotta know one thing.
what's your real number?
that's not bad. It's not 200. It's not...
Twenty-two's the number of people I lost, Jake.
only number I kept track of.
keeps the sea out of your mouth.
Hey.
Hi.
you started painting again?
Yeah. Great light up there.
you know,
I wanna apologize for the phone calls, Helen.
I should've given you your space.
and you felt showing up here unannounced was the best way to communicate that?
Hey.
please just... -Ben.
I want you to have it, along with these.
I signed them.
why now?
I had a... I had a case a while back.
you know, a couple was drowning.
by the time I got there, the husband was dragging his wife under, just trying to stay afloat.
pure survival instinct.
it took me...
took me a long time to understand that that man was me.
sorry.
aren't you gonna answer that?
I'm not a rescue swimmer anymore, Helen.
Bye, baby.
lock it up.
we have a 75-foot fishing vessel in distress, taking on water in high seas.
she's dead in the water with four souls onboard.
with its dewatering pumps unable to keep up, it's not a matter of if this thing is going down, but when.
tighten her down! We gotta secure her.
there will come a time when you're going to have to say no.
you'll be facing crews from five to 20, all saying, " Save me, save me. "
they're looking for a miracle.
at 24 years old, you have to find a way to be that miracle.
sounds good. We'll plan our free-fall deployment to the water.
are you good with that, Jake? -Yeah, copy that.
okay, if we have to put you in, we're gonna get you in upswell and let the waves take you down to the boat.
are you good with that? -Roger.
we're only gonna have about 20 minutes on-scene, -so we gotta be quick. -Copy that.
all right, I got the vessel in sight. Two o'clock, about 50 meters.
cabin door open and locked.
Pre-rescue checklist for free-fall deployment.
whoa, whoa! Boat just took a wave, sir.
one appears to have gone on the edge.
he's hanging from the cargo net.
we need to get our swimmer down there.
computer's showing 60 knots...
going off com.
prepare for a free-fall deployment of the rescue swimmer.
rescue checklist, part two.
swimmer's getting ready.
rescue checklist complete. Swimmer's coming out.
Roger that. Check swimmer.
swimmer's at the door, sir. Checking swimmer.
swimmer ready?
God help you if you ain't, boy.
swimmer's away.
swimmer's okay. He's heading towards the vessel.
all right, he's cutting through those waves pretty good.
that's it. He's approaching the vessel.
he's at the boat, sir.
man, are we glad to see you!
Kodiak Ops, rescue 6034.
Fischer's onboard, but vessel is compromised.
taking on lots of water. May not hold much longer.
stand by for further.
how many guys you got on here? Is anybody injured?
I got four guys.
this guy's got a broken leg.
the skipper's down below. He's trying to start the pumps.
all right, he's gonna go up first. -All right.
Kodiak Ops, Kodiak Ops, this is rescue 6034.
there's three onboard with injuries, one more down below.
what do you want me to do?
you there, help me get him around in here.
bring him on in. -All right.
basket is on its way up.
strap in. Strap in!
the captain's down below, and there's one other man on deck.
help him out. Strap yourself in. Get out of the way.
I repeat, the boat's going down fast. Eight minutes to bingo.
all right, come on, get in the basket.
I have the ready-for-pickup signal.
hold on.
swimmer One, Swimmer One, come in.
rescue swimmer, 6034.
Fischer. Come in, Fischer.
swimmer One, Swimmer One, come in.
this is Swimmer One. -Roger that, Swimmer One. Go ahead.
swimmer One. I got one down below. I'm gonna go down there.
swimmer One, be advised we've got seven minutes to bingo.
I'm going down.
captain? - Yeah!
captain?
captain! I'm a rescue swimmer. I'm here to help you out.
your leg is jammed in here? Or is it just closed...
it's the whole leg!
I tried to free the clutch and got stuck.
this is Swimmer One.
I got the captain down here in the engine room. He's stuck.
we're gonna be a little bit.
swimmer One, we're about out of time.

look for flares, strobes, anything. He fell right in the debris.
lost swimmer. Lost swimmer.
the Coast Guard conducted one of the largest search-and-rescue missions for a single man in its history, but the body of Senior Chief Ben Randall was never found.
I'm sorry, Helen.
there's nothing more we can do.
what makes a legend?
is it what someone did when they were alive...
Randall never was much for this sort of thing.
or how they're remembered after they're gone?
some people actually believe
senior Chief made the swim to the Aleutian Islands.
he's standing on a distant beach somewhere with a fishing pole in his hand.
but I found my answer a couple weeks later.
where is he?
there's nobody else out there, man.
no, he was there.
he was with me the whole time.
he said he would hold on till help arrived.
he never let go.
there's a legend of a man who lives beneath the sea.
he is a fisher of men, a last hope for all those who have been left behind.
he is known as the Guardian.
Ben Randall always said life is about making choices.
in the end, by making his, he helped me make mine.
what do you remember?
what did you smell? What did you see?
how did this make you feel?
I'll be right back.
what are you doing here?
I lied to you.
I can't do casual.
faster, faster.
how the hell are you?
get off that saddle, right now.
that's my little brother.
I promised Mom I would always protect him...
...but I had a feeling this one was gonna be different.
something was telling me, this time...
...one of us wasn't gonna make it back home.
how long we gotta be out here? -Long as it takes, little brother.
till we know that place like the back of your hand.
l hate this part.
look, it ain't no action, man.
you gonna get plenty soon enough.
what about the others?
don't worry, they'll be here.
my friend, the reverend.
some say he found God after the devil rejected him.
who are you?
born of the dust, l was made in his image.
the gentleman thief, Kansas.
he was my wild card.
full house, gentlemen.
no.
l don't never lose...
...especially to no thief.
gentlemen...
somebody get the sheriff. -Get him yourself.
but there was one more.
to do this job, I had to find Mara.
it wasn't hard. She was still up to her old tricks.
what the hell?
what the hell's the matter with you, lndian?
l don't think this squaw speaks no English.
coin?
she thinks she's gonna rob us.
be prepared to meet your maker, savage.
Oh, boy.
we don't take kindly to your type around here.
and what type would that be?
sneaky lowlife niggers like yourselves.
now you done gone and did it. -Done what?
done gone and made him mad.
see, he don't like blacks calling other blacks niggers.
boy, you kidding me?
there's six of us and two of you.
you know, you right, and that don't seem fair, do it?
so you wanna run off and get some more men?
kill him.
kill him!
looks like game's over, huh, fancy pants?
now, that wasn't very gentleman-like, was it?
come on.
looks like we got ourselves a real Mexican standoff now, don't we?
well, since l'm a gambling man, l'm betting on me.
damn it, woman!
brother Willoby.
you're not taking the Lord's name in vain, are you?
no.
for a preacher man...
...you sure hang out with a motley crew.
a hustler...
...and a half-breed.
only the Lord may judge, Brother Willoby.
l merely tend to the flock.
well, you're okay with me.
hail, hail, the gang's all here.
thought you two got out of the game.
hell, you know me.
l get bored easy.
how's tricks? -l suppose you ought to ask Mara.
l must admit, l was intrigued when l received your letter.
we all were.
Zane and l wouldn't have bothered if it wasn't worth it.
who's that?
this here is my friend, medicine man.
his Christian name is Jacob.
his heathen name is Running Fox.
no offense to present company.
we met up at Doc Willoby's cabin.
I called, and they answered.
this gang is like family...
...and family don't ask questions.
there wasn't much in it for them, and they knew that.
this job was personal.
this time, it was about me and my brother.
okay, guys, this is our next job.
Zane got this from a former bank associate...
...who will no longer be needing it.
...which means " heart of death, " about a half day's ride from here.
Yeah, the bank's a depository for the railroad.
railroad?
that means a lot of money.
lt also means a lot of guns, which means a lot of bullets...
...and a lot of dead.
so we're gonna come in in twos, split.
l'm gonna take the point.
Kansas, l need you back here.
Mara, by this window.
as usual, fear is in our favor. Let's keep it that way.
but why this bank?
because it belongs to him.
well...
...get on with it.
lt's official, Mr. Driscoll. You now effectively own the bank.
like everything else in this town.
l get what l pay for.
ls there something else?
yeah-- Mr. Driscoll, the ch
the chamber of commerce feel that the taxes...
...well, they're too exacerbated.
tell me, Mr. Mayor.
where would this town be without my protection and investments?
you think l like this godforsaken shithole?
this town is like any other town l've brought up:
purely a means to an end.
there, you see?
my son, Bert.
my pride and joy.
a fine, upstanding citizen.
he's a good-for-nothing asshole.
but he's my son. What's a man to do?
groom him to be my successor, that's what.
l'll tell you what, Crawley...
...Bert would make a great mayor.
now, wait a minute, that's my
no one's got a job unless l allow it.
ls that clear to everyone?
absolutely clear, Mr. Driscoll, yes. -Yes. Absolutely.
he owns everything.
may as well change the name of the town to Driscollville.
asshole.
no.
somebody stop him.
sheriff. Sheriff, there's trouble.
please, it's my ma. They're gonna kill her.
leave her alone.
come on.
stop.
ma.
ma?
ma.
ma!
ma.
come on, we're out of here.
damn you, Bert. -l ain't doing it for you now, all right?
there ain't no call for this. -lt ain't none of your business.
you messed up, hear? You can't touch me, you know.
just go away, okay? Go away.
come on, boys, drinks on the house.
take her to the undertaker.
Hey, sheriff, can l ask you a question?
shoot.
l mean, this piece of crap town...
...nobody cares about it. Why do you care?
are you all right, sir?
l would like to make a considerable deposit...
...into your...
...fine establishment.
of course.
however...
...l was wondering, for my own piece of mind...
...when would the railroads be coming through...
...to pick up the deposits?
l'm not allowed to give out that kind of information.
you'd have to speak with the bank manager, Mr. Hickle, about that.
you know, being that there are all sorts...
...of unsavory types lurking about...
...dealing with folks such as ourselves is a much more...
...pleasant situation.
catch my meaning?
much obliged, Miss Lorelie.
what--? But what about your deposit?
l have some other matters to attend to.
just two ships merely passing in the night.
Bert. -Yo, Pop.
why are we still here?
l mean, what are we doing?
for now...
...this is our town, Bert.
our town makes me sick.
l've changed the name.
make us more at home.
every father, Bert...
...lives in the dream...
...that his child will be greater than himself.
that he will surpass him...
...not just in material things...
...but will in time come to show more compassion...
...more love, patience...
...than l have been able to show.
every day...
...you make me lose faith in that dream.
what will it be, gents? -Whiskey all around.
do you think this a prudent idea?
we gotta wet our whistles before we hit the trail.
what if somebody recognizes us?
ain't nobody gonna recognize us.
how you wanna do this?
we're gonna drink up, walk out and right out of town.
he's right there.
lf we cause a scene, we're gonna blow the job.
fuck that job.
easy now, little brother.
give me the bottle.
shall l put that on your tab, Mr. Driscoll?
on his tab? Don't you know who his daddy is?
no tab. My old man owns this joint.
go away.
l don't pay.
everybody gotta pay.
you say, every--? What? What was that?
everybody gotta pay?
l said, you gonna pay. -l know you, boy?
l said, do l know you, boy?
l'm sure you remember me.
no, don't remember you.
no. Refresh my memory, huh?
burned our farm.
murdered our kin.
you know, l do a lot of that.
you can't expect me to remember every farm l burn.
little place south of Flat Ridge.
came between you and your railroad.
Oh, yeah, yeah, l remember that one.
Yeah, a lot of screaming. l mean, what, did you run away?
did you run off and leave your family?
don't worry about it.
you should never assume a man is dead...
...just because you shot him.
that's good advice.
l'll remember that next time.
ain't no next time.
hell.
l'm sorry, Mr. Driscoll, l...
l'm sorry that...
you were here.
did you see them? Did you see who killed my son?
l'm afraid not.
no one...
...but no one, crosses a Driscoll and lives to tell about it.
get me Wolverton.
what were you thinking? -He had it coming.
they saw us. Our cover is blown.
we can't go back there now.
lt could have gone better.
maybe we could use this to our advantage.
what you thinking?
the last thing they're gonna expect is for us to come back and hit the bank.
right. Because it's suicide.
you serious? l thought he was the crazy one.
Hey, man, don't call me that.
what did you learn at the bank?
well, the payroll is scheduled to be picked up at noon.
a quarter of a million dollars the day after tomorrow.
you better be playing that when he gets up.
take a few men out back.
don't let anybody get past, you hear me? Now go.
Yes, yes, uncle. You, you. Come here.
surround.
fire.
everybody stay down!
Longcoats! -No shit.
stay down! Stay down! -Shit!
man, shut up, we done been in tougher scrapes than this before.
let's go! -l think we overstayed our welcome.
run for it, baby!
l swear to God, if l get killed...
...my ghost gonna come back and bust your ass.
cover me now.
l'm going out.
go! Go!
Hey, why did you stop me?
why did you stop me?
lt was him! -Who?
Wolverton.
anybody hurt?
okay. These longcoats are like wild coyotes.
once they get their teeth into you-- -Hey. What's the plan?
Mara knows these parts better than anyone.
l know a spot. -Okay, lead on.
come on.
l thought l told you to watch the back.
uncle, l did. -l told you, nobody gets by.
uncle Wolverton, l tried. l swear to you, l tried.
there was a guy in a tree. We never saw him.
he froze.
no. -lt's all right.
lt's all right.
we're still gonna get them.
and you're my favorite nephew.
now let's mount up. l want that bounty.
l take first watch. -Sure you're up to it?
Oh, yeah.
all right, then, l'll sleep good for a change.
come on.
spill the beans, Rev.
come on, Rev, give it up.
tell us about Mara. -What's it like?
flesh of my flesh, bone of my bones.
come on, man, with that.
half black, half lndian?
come on. That must be real sweet.
must be great.
lt's like finding a cactus flower among sagebrush.
what the hell?
what the--?
Hey, you gotta go find it, you know?
she's messing up my duds. -And a cactus has thorns.
she's a wild one.
when we hit that bank, we have to go by the book.
not that book.
nobody gets hurt.
we get what we want, and we get out, clear?
l got your back.
and everything should go off without a hitch.
couldn't keep your mouth shut.
please, May, this is official.
Yes, good afternoon, sheriff. Greetings.
how are you feeling this fine day?
well, l was
we were wondering that-- -For heaven's sake, get to the point!
Yes, dear.
well, it's about this rampant violence.
something's gotta be done about it.
we can get rid of it today. -We can?
Yep.
with a million dollars and the 7th Cavalry.
no disrespect intended, sheriff.
lf l do say so, you are handling your duties magnificently...
...and as mayor-- Oh, l've got a hole in my coat.
Driscollville, it is my responsibility to ensure...
...that you have whatever you need to do your job to the best of your ability.
all l need is one thing, mayor.
what might that be?
more bullets.
bullets? More? --More bullets.
good afternoon, sheriff. -Mayor.
tell me you got them. -Not yet, sir.
excuses are a dime a dozen...
...and not worth a plugged nickel.
Mr. Driscoll...
...a man's reputation is everything.
l've collected every bounty l've ever gone after.
this here gonna be no different.
now...
...there's been a change in plans.
Yes, may l help you?
me and my men are here to pick up the payroll early.
this is highly irregular.
orders straight from Mr. Driscoll.
l see. How early?
first thing in the morning.
fine.
okay, as soon as we come in, Zane, you handle the guards.
don't kill anybody unless you got to.
Mara, if we need a blast, you got us covered?
l got it.
okay. Rev, you handle the tellers and any customers.
Kansas, we need you to cover this window right here.
make sure nobody joins our little party.
lf we do this right...
...we all walk out rich bastards.
and if we don't?
then lunch is on you tomorrow.
okay. Enough talk.
let's play some music.
l like that.
they'll never see us.
Hey.
tight britches.
why you always fiddling with them playing cards, huh?
because they help sharpen the reflexes, madame.
what you call me?
you trying to say something about my past?
that's not what he meant. -No, l heard him.
anybody ever see such a pretty cowboy?
l think Kansas here is one of them dandies.
that's enough, Mara.
that's why you wear them gloves?
why are you dressed like that anyway?
you think you better than us or something?
Mara. -ls that why you wear them...
...Pollyanna gloves?
Yeah. l wanna know why.
okay.
that's why.
l used to be a painter.
l had myself a little gallery.
that is, before the Klan paid me a visit.
l lost everything.
l tracked all of them down, one by one.
law's been looking for me ever since.
l swore that, no matter what...
...in the end...
...l shall be holding the cards.
why are you still awake?
you know l'm always psyched before a job.
what the hell?
man, that is one strange-ass couple.
a reverend-- -And a soiled dove.
Oh, yeah, baby.
how the hell they hook up anyway?
she didn't have it easy.
a woman of leisure...
...who was nearly whipped to death by her master.
and the rev...
...he was the preacher up at Lone Pine...
...the place of the massacre.
he was forced to watch his wife and child killed...
...right in front of him.
that night, he lost his faith.
who could do something like that?
that low-down, dirty Wolverton.
l'm glad Mom can't see us now.
Hey.
we doing all this for Mom, remember?
yeah...
...but this gotta be the last one.
we gotta get back home.
all we got is each other, little brother.
l'm gonna catch some shuteye. You should do the same.
lost something?
l'm sure Mara didn't mean anything.
she was just riding you.
but l ain't a horse.
no, not, of course.
a Midsummer Night's Dream.
lovers and madmen have such seething brains.
that's Mr. William Shakespeare.
shakespeare's dreams.
l got nightmares too.
except they're with me when l wake up.
this town, Corazon...
...think it's gonna be one of them.
the big score, the chance to cash out.
l just wanna get out of this life alive.
no. They're headed back to Corazon.
it may be a shithoIe, but it's the onIy shithoIe between here and the border.
I got a feeIing they got business there. Come on! Come on!
nobody move!
touch it, and you got two choices: die sIow or die sIower.
I don't wanna die. I don't.
you move, I sIice your throat.
you smarter than you Iook. Let's move it!
what is the meaning of this?
ain't you ever been robbed before? -I have not.
littie brother, we got us here a virgin.
CongratuIations, you just got your cherry popped.

MercifuI is the Lord. Cooperate, and no one gets hurt.

no shit. -ReIax. We're gonna get out.
how? -Linc, how?
you, come here. -Me? But
shut up, I ain't got time. Where's the back exit?
there isn't one.
what about the motherfucking back window?
from the Iooks of things, they thought of that too.
you, come here.
Linc, did we fuck up?
no.
I fucked up.
I guess we stay down. Just don't hurt us.
I say we bIast our way out.
Hey, as hot as you are, missy, you shouIdn't be working that there.
look, we got hostages.
why don't we use them as shieIds.
hoId on. We're not using the hostages.
why not? -Because they're innocent, that's why.
no one is innocent.
I'm getting the fuck out of here. -Mara, wait.
the Ionger we stay in here, the more men they get out there.
what we gonna do?
I need a drink.
we're gonna go with Mara's idea. -About?
we gotta use the hostages. -Linc.
we have no choice.
get up! Get up! Get up! Get in there!
come on, move it! Move it!
move it!
wait.
you hear that?
I don't hear nothing.
they just reaIized we got hostages.
they're waiting for our next move.
they're never gonna taIk to us.
I don't trust Mara with aII this hostage shit.
don't worry about her. I got that.
remember what Mom used to teII us when we were kids?
Yeah.
the onIy way you don't get into the Lord's gates...
...is when you harm the innocent.
I think I wanna go to heaven someday.
Yeah.
hope it's not too soon.
sheriff...
...you better end this quick, or I wiII.
I think they wish to taIk.
why is she onIy asking for you?
I'm going out. -Linc.
what's going on?
I know her.
aII right. We can get her out in the open...
...and then pIug her fuII of buIIets. -Anybody shoot her, they die.
we're on the same team here, remember?
Linc, go handIe your business.
we'II cover you.
you sure about this, sheriff? -Yep, I'II be okay.
how you know that?
I just do. Nobody shoot, okay? Got it?
make sure of it. -AII right, but I stiII...
...don't think it's a good idea.
Hola, LincoIn.
I never stopped Ioving you...
...even when you chose my best friend over me.
aII those stories I heard about you...
...are they true?
that's not the man I knew.
the man you knew died a Iong time ago.
come in with me.
it's the best way.
to what, a pine box?
hangman's rope?
not even you couId stop this.
damn. Why did you come back here?
those criminaIs kiIIed my son...
...and now they've got my money.
and my bounty.
what are we gonna do?
go in there and fIush them out Iike the weaseIs they are.
...gather the men.
you know this is gonna end bad, right?
and I thought I was Iucky.
not Iucky, just good.
who fired that shot?
it wasn't us, sheriff.
I mean, honest. It must have came from the back.
we need to taIk.
Mr. DriscoII-- -Now.
what you think they doing out there?
fortifying their position.
making preparations for the finaI assauIt.
how you know?
because...
...that's what I wouId do.
Hey.
where you going? -I've been appointed...
...to speak for the group.
how come? -I'm the mayor's wife.
is that so?
I'm a IittIe cIaustrophobic. Can we come out?
Yeah, come out.
thank you.
a queen for a queen.
shut this kid up...
...or eIse I'II shut him up for good.
I hate IittIe kids.
you are a man of the cIoth.
how couId you be a part of this?
we're gonna Iet the hostages go.
you wanna do what?
look, they're a handfuI.
we got a coupIe of women, a chiId, an oId man.
they'II sIow us down, maybe get us kiIIed.
no, no. No way.
they're the onIy things that stand between us and them.
we just keep the most vaIuabIe one. -Which one?
her.
why her?
she's the mayor's wife.
why is one better than a bunch?
the queen is aIways more vaIuabIe than a bunch of jokers.
there must be some mistake.
why don't you keep the bank manager and his wife.
if you Iet me go, I guarantee that my husband wiII Iet you aII go free.
that's why you're gonna stay.
for Mom.
for Mom.
I don't Iike this. -You don't Iike anything.
I don't Iike the way you been running things.
you think you couId do better? -Yeah.
what the heII is your probIem?
what are you doing?
I'm getting the heII out of here!
you coming or not?
are you coming or what?

I want you to give yourseIf up.

Linc, stop, man. -It's onIy me and you Ieft.
what kind of sense that make if we both die?
I'm gonna Iive through you, IittIe brother.
at the count of three...
...you break for the rear...
...and you don't look back.
promise me.
I promise.
okay.
one.
two.
three.
so here We Were. The plan had led us here.
that's my little brother.
I promised Mom I Would always protect him...
...but I had a feeling this one Was gonna be different.
something Was telling me, this time...
...one of us Wasn't gonna make it back home.
mama, I'm coming home.
come on, you gotta give me something to work with.
Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician.
he can't just wave his little wand in the air to make a plausible defense materialize.
look at what the other side is gonna run at us.
they got the company books prepared by you,
cooked by you. That's motive.
they got a murder scene you had access to. That's opportunity.
they got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with.
a dame's weapon. - It was Big Dave's.
don't interrupt me. That's means.
they got a fine, upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim,
and then they got you,
a disgruntled, number-juggling underling,
who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk...
and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
I was with her.
like I say,
it stinks.
I killed him.
okay. You killed him.
okay, we forget the blackmail thing. You killed him.
how come?
he and Doris, uh, were having an affair.
okay.
how did you know?
I just knew.
a husband knows.
will anyone else say they knew?
and don't say your wife.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
how did you get into the store?
I took Doris's keys.
will anyone say they saw you there, on your way there, in there, on your way back?
I don't think so.
will anyone corroborate any goddamn part of your story at all?
Oh, come on! People, you can't help each other like that.
let's be realistic, now.
let's look at our options. Well, frankly, I don't see any options.
look, I cannot present story "A." I cannot present story "B.
I could plead you for a nutcase, but you look too composed.
I could offer a guilty plea, and in return they don't give you the juice,
but I don't think you want to spend the rest of your life in chino.
I know you didn't hire Freddy Riedenschneider
to hold your hand at a sentencing hearing.
you could have gotten Lloyd Garroway for that.
no, no, no, no. We're not giving up yet.
you hired Freddy Riedenschneider, It means you're not throwing in the towel.
I litigate.
I don't capitulate.
all right. No options? We gotta think.
all right. We go back to the blackmail thing. Yeah, it titillates.
it's open-ended, and it makes him the bad guy.
you dig around, you never know. Something unsavory from his past.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Forget the jealous husband thing. That's just silly.
we're going with the blackmail. I'll be in touch.
of course there was one person who could confirm Doris's story,
or plenty of it.
the dry-cleaning pansy.
but he'd left the hotel, skipped out on his bill.
he'd also disappeared from the residence he gave me,
owing two months'rent.
how could I have been so stupid?
handing over $10, 000 for a piece of paper.
and the man gone, like a ghost.
gone now.
all gone.
the money gone, Big Dave gone,
Doris going.
how could I have been so stupid?
sooner or later, everyone needs a haircut.
we were working for the bank now.
make the payments, tread the water day by day,
day by day.
most people think someone's accused of a crime,
they haul 'em in and bring 'em to trial, But it's not like that.
it's not that fast.
the wheels of justice turn slow.
they have the arraignment, then the indictment,
and they entertain motions to dismiss and postpone and change the venue...
and alter this and that and the other.
they impanel a jury, which bring more motions.
then they set a trial date, and then they change the date.
and then, often as not, they'll change it again.
not guilty, your honor.
and through all of it, we cut the hair.
meantime, Freddy Riedenschneider slept at the Metropole...
and shoveled it in at Da Vinci's.
to nose around into Big Dave's past.
I found myself, more and more, going over to the Abundas's.
it was a routine we fell into most every evening.
I even went when Walter was away on his research trips.
he was a genealogist,
had traced back his side of the family seven generations,
his late wife's eight.
it seemed like a screwy hobby,
but then maybe all hobbies are.
maybe Walter found something there in the old county courthouses,
hospital file rooms,
city archives, property rolls,
registries.
something maybe like what I found listening to Birdy play.
some kind of escape.
some kind of peace.
they got this guy in Germany.
Fritz something or other.
anyway... He's got this theory.
you want to test something, you know, scientifically...
how the planet go 'round the sun,
what sunspots are made of,
why the water comes out of the tap...
well, you gotta look at it.
but sometimes you look at it...
your looking changes it.
you can't know the reality of what happened,
or what would have happened,
if you hadn't stuck in your own goddamn schnozz.
so there is no "What happened.
looking at something...
changes it.
they call it the uncertainty principle.
sure, it sound screwy, but even Einstein says the guy's onto something.
science.
perception.
reality.
doubt.
reasonable... doubt.
the less you really know.
it's a fact, a proved fact.
in... In a way,
it's the only fact there is.
this Heinie even wrote it out in numbers.
burns?
subject: David Allen Brewster,
born Brooklyn, 1 91 1.
subject educated public schools. One year case western university.
flunks out.
1 931, Retail appliance salesman in Barnhoff's department store, Cincinnati.
1 933, Meets Ann Nirdlinger. They marry that year.
1 935, Arrested on assault complaint.
complainant has a broken nose, couple of broken ribs.
36, Another assault beef at a bar room altercation.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Couple of fistfights, right? Go to his service record.
inducted march 15, 1 942.
served in a clerical capacity in the U. S. Naval shipyards at San Diego.
one fistfight, broken up by the M. P.S.
no court-martial. Honorable discharge, may 8, 1 945.
since then, he's been clean. - Thank you, Barns. Get lost.
so?
so?
this could be your Dolly's ticket out of the death house.
so!
I don't get it.
look, chump.
this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right?
Island-hopping,
practically liberated, the pacific all by himself,
with a knife in one hand, a gun in the other,
and 20 yards of jap guts between his teeth.
and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass...
in some boat yard in San Diego.
you asked for blackmail.
Mr. Hail-fellow-well-met, about to open his own business here,
has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years,
probably including half the people sitting on that jury.
well, it finally caught up with him.
somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says.
they called, they demanded money.
did Big Dave mention it was something about his war service?
I don't know. I wasn't there.
you have to tell us.
maybe he specified, maybe he didn't.
I'm not putting words in your mouth, no.
but the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator,
turns to you to help him out of his jam.
fat-assed son of a bitch.
so who... who actually... - Who?
who?
I don't know who.
but the point is that if Mr. Prosecutor over there...
had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting this woman...
to even the most cursory investigation of this schmo's past,
then we might know who.
but we can't know who. We can't know what really happened.
because the more you look, the less you know.
but the beauty of it is...
we don't gotta know.
we just gotta show that, god damn it, they don't know.
because of Fritz, or Werner, whatever the hell his name is.
Freddy Riedenschneider sees daylight.
comin' out!
big Dave.
what a dope.
so maybe Riedenschneider could fix it for Doris.
maybe it would all work out.
and I thought,
I hoped,
that maybe there was a way out for me as well.
he was deaf when he wrote this.
who?
Beethoven.
he created it, but he never actually heard it.
I guess he just heard it all in his head somehow.
the girl had talent. Anyone could see that.
and she wasn't some fly-by-nighter.
she was just a good, clean kid.
if she was going to have a career, she'd need a responsible adult... Looking out for her,
some kind of manager.
she'd have contracts to look at, be going out on tours,
playing on the radio, maybe.
I could help her sort through all that without charging her an arm and a leg.
just enough to get by.
then I could be with her,
enough to keep myself feeling okay.
why couldn't that work?
why not?
Hi, Mr. Crane. - Hello, Birdy.
I thought that was real good.
Yeah, I messed up a little bit on the, um, on the agitato,
but if nobody noticed, then it's okay.
Oh, this is, um, a friend of mine.
Tony, um, Mr. Crane.
Hello, Tony.
Hello, sir.
Congratulations.
think I'll be getting home now.
it was... nice to meet you, sir.
you too, Tony.
why couldn't it work?
anyway, that's what I was thinking in the days leading up to the trial.
it seemed like once that was over, I'd be ready for a new start.
Freddy Riedenschneider was busy preparing.
he was very optimistic.
and finally it came... the first day of the trial,
what Riedenschneider called 'The big show.
Where's the judge? How come there's no judge?
Where's the judge, Ed?
riedenschneider.
how come the judge doesn't come out?
the judge comes in last. He'll come in when Doris gets here.
so where's Doris? I thought we started at 10: 00.
Hey, Riedenschneider. Where's Doris?
late? How can she be late?
she's in prison, Ed. None of us are in prison.
and yet we're not late. We're on time, Ed.
how can Doris be late?
what, they don't have wake-up calls?
all rise. - No, no.
counselors.
what's going on, Ed?
I thought there would be arguments,
the bailiff and so forth.
ed, what is this?
is this procedure?
in the matter of the people v. Doris Crane,
case number SR-87249,
cause now pending is hereby dismissed...
I don't understand it.
had a real shot at this. I could've won this thing.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
your service is no longer needed... And you are now discharge.
she's hanged herself.
I'd brought her a dress to wear to court, and she'd used the belt.
at first I thought she'd figured out somehow how I fit into it...
and couldn't stand it, couldn't stand knowing.
but that wasn't it, I'd find out later.
for now, everything just seemed ruined.
Freddy Riedenschneider went back to Sacramento,
still shaking his head, saying it was the biggest disappointment
of his professional career.
Frankie fell to pieces.
I suspect he was drinking.
anyway, he stopped coming in to work.
that left me to keep the place going, or the bank would've taken it.
I was the principal barber now.
I hired a new man for the second chair.
I'd hired the guy who did the least gabbing whie he came in for an interview,
but I guess the new man had only kept quiet because he was nervous.
once he had the job, he talked from the minute I opened the shop in the morning...
until I locked up at night.
for all I know, he talked to himself on the way home.
when I walked home, it seemed like everyone avoided looking at me,
as if I'd caught some disease.
this thing with Doris, nobody wanted to talk about it.
it was like I was a ghost walking down the street.
and when I got home now,
I sat in the house,
but there was nobody there.
I was a ghost.
I didn't see anyone.
no one saw me.
I was the barber.
some bacon and potatoes, which are supposed to come with it.
so I pay for it, and I put the change in my pocket without really looking...
cause, gosh, who looks at the change when you eat there every day?
two blocks later I look at the change she gave me. Golly, I'm two bits short.
so I walk back over to Linton's, find this gal, big argument.
she doesn't even recall the transaction.
doesn't recall the transaction. No recollections.
if you're in before 6: 00, it's the whatchamacallit...
the early bird special. - Yeah, the early riser.
Crane?
I'm Crane.
my name's Diedrickson, county medical examiner.
yeah?
I just came by for an informal chat.
why don't I buy you a drink?
rye.
just coffee.
you sure you don't want something stiffer?
county M. E. does an autopsy on anyone who dies in custody.
I don't know if you knew that.
it's routine.
doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's been foul play.
however,
I don't think I'm prohibited from telling you this.
of course, I'm not obliged to either.
I just don't know.
but if I were the man,
I'd want to be told.
told what?
I'm not here to add to your...
Thanks.
your wife was pregnant.
first trimester.
there it is.
I'm sorry.
hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
my wife and I had not performed the sex act in many years.
well,
that's really none of my business.
I'm sorry.
there it is.
good luck, Crane.
Doris and I had never really talked much.
I don't think that's a bad thing necessarily.
but it is funny. Now I wanted to talk.
now, with everyone gone,
I was alone with secrets I didn't want...
and no one to tell 'em to anyway.
I went to see a woman who was supposed to have powers in communicating...
with those who had "Passed across," as she called it.
who they'd communicate with.
not like most people you run into on this side.
give me your hand.
well, first she told me that my wife was in a peachful place,
that our souls were still connected,
that she'd never stopped loving me...
even though she'd done some things she wasn't proud of.
man, she was reading me like a book.
she was a phony, just another gabber.
I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger,
I had to turn my back on the old lady,
on the veils, on the ghosts,
on the dead,
before they all sucked me in.
Ed?
how are you holding up?
okay, Walter. Thanks.
l, uh... I was so damn sorry to hear about your loss.
a terrible thing. It's just damn terrible.
uh, Birdy's upstairs. I'm on long-distance, so...
sure, Walter.
Hello, Birdy.
Hi, Mr. Crane.
we haven't seen you since...
we've certainly missed you.
birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking.
there are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me.
life has dealt me some bum cards.
or maybe I just haven't played them right.
pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
I'm sorry.
well, sometimes I have a cigarette when he's away, but never when he's home.
he can smell it a mile off.
well, sure. It's his house.
that's what he keeps telling me.
anyway, my point is you're young,
a kid, really, your whole life ahead of you.
but it's not too soon to start making opportunities for yourself...
before it all washes away.
Yeah, I guess. Pop says so too.
you know, I work pretty hard at school.
that's swell.
the lessons from Mrs. Swan, they'll only take you so far.
there's this guy in San Francisco.
I've made inquiries.
everybody says he's the best.
trained people who've gone on to big concert careers in symphony orchestras, the works.
his name is Jacques...
carcanogues.
I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a frenchman.
Oh, boy. A frenchman, huh? - You've got talent.
anybody can see that. And he's the best.
if he sees a student that he thinks has talent,
he takes them on for next to nothing. So you're a cinch to be accepted.
I could cover the costs of the lessons. Like I said, it's pretty modest.
Oh, Jeez, Mr. Crane. - No, I have to do it.
I can't stand by and watch any more things go down the drain.
you're young. You don't understand.
well, Jeez, Mr. Crane. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
look, just go see him as a favor to me.
he loosened up a little bit when I told him how talented you were.
he's agreed to see you this Saturday.
he said, uh, maybe you're a diamond in the rough.
his words.
jeez, I don't know, Mr. Crane.
just go see him as a favor to me.
you are the father?
no, I'm her... I'm a family friend.
I am Carcanogues. You will wait, my dear.
you have a special interest in music?
a music lover, alors.
um, I don't pretend to be an expert.
how did she do?
she seemed like a very nice girl.
she play, monsieur,
like a very nice girl.
stinks.
nice girl,
however, stinks.
well, I don't understand.
is not so hard to understand.
her playing, uh, very polite.
did she make mistakes?
mistake? No.
it say "E-flat," she play E-flat.
ping, ping. She play the right note always.
well, I don't understand. No mistakes?
look, she's just a kid. I thought you taught these kids to...
no, no, no, monsieur. That is what I cannot teach her, huh? I cannot teach her to have the soul.
hmm, voyez, monsieur. Look.
to play the piano is not about the fingers.
we make with the fingers.
but the music, monsieur, she come from L'interieur, from inside, huh?
the music,
she starts here.
she come out through here.
hmm? Then perhaps,
perhaps,
she can go here.
like I said, I'm not an expert.
so you can listen to me, for I am expert.
voyez, monsieur. This girl, nice girl.
very clever hands. Nice girl.
I think, uh, perhaps some day...
she can make very good typist, huh?
voila.
no, but more or less.
but there must be a dozen teachers better than this clown.
no, look, really... - More qualified.
goddamn phony.
really, it's okay.
I'm not interested in playing music pofessionally.
you know, I'm not sure I want a career at all,
and if I did, I'd probably be a veterinarian.
but l-I do appreciate your interest.
it was nothing.
I wish I'd played better for you 'cause I know it would've made you real happy.
you know what you are?
what?
you're an enthusiast.
Yeah, maybe.
you know, I really do appreciate the interest you've taken.
I just wanted to make you happy.
no, it's really okay. I wanna do it.
birdy! - No, it's okay, really.
Mr. Crane, I wanna do it. Mr. Crane!
birdy, please don't do that! - Mr. Crane, please!
heavens to betsy, Birdy! - Please, Mr. Crane.
time slow down right before in accident,
and I have time to think about things.
I thought about what an undertaker had told me once.
that your hair keeps growing for a while, anyway,
after you die.
and then it stops.
I thought, "What keeps it growing?
is it like a plant in soil?
what goes out of the soil?
the soul?
and when does the hair realize that it's gone?
I noticed you still have pea stone in your driveway.
ha. Where does it go, huh?
like the odd sock.
course, you know where it goes. You probably pick pieces of it off your lawn all the time,
churn it up with your lawn mover, sweep it off your porch there.
pain in the neck. - Never bothered me.
well, have you ever considered tar macadam?
but we have the technology now to bring it to the homeowner,
individual consumer, at very competitive prices.
mind if I show you the specifications? Afternoon, Ma'am.
what are you selling?
for your home driveway here.
here's the brochure. It's the modern way to...
get lost.
Jesus.
Doris.
don't say anything. I'm fine.
crane.
Mr. Crane?
are you there?
are you awake?
he's comin' around.
can you talk, sir? These men have to talk to you.
are you awake? Sir?
he's... he's awake. Go ahead.
are you awake?
is he awake?
crane, as soon as you're conscious, we have to tell you that...
uh, is he conscious? - His eyes are open.
uh, you're under arrest.
soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you.
does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
they'll take you to the prison hospital. - Under arrest for murder.
birdy. Uh, the girl. No, the girl's okay.
broken clavicle.
that's a collarbone, Crane. It's broken.
she's okay, though.
so he understands, then, he's under arrest for murder?
big Dave. - Huh?
what? What'd he say?
he said okay.
is that what he said?
you're under arrest for the murder of Creighton Tolliver.
you understad that?
does he understand?
the pansy.
a kid diving in a water holeoutside of town had found his car.
they winched it out...
and found he'd been beaten, just like Big Dave said.
beaten to death.
inside his briefcase were the partnership papers I'd signed,
for the district attorney, that made it fall into place.
I'd gotten Doris to steal the money.
the pansy had gotten wise somehow, so I had to kill him to cover my tracks.
on the arraignment calendar,
people v. Edward Crane.
I was in a spot.
you are charged in a one-count complaint...
he said he didn't ordinarily work that cheap,
but he figured he owed me something since the last one hadn't played out.
how do you now plead? - We plead not guilty, your honor.
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me.
he said the story made his head hurt.
he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat...
for the murder of Big Dave. - Trial date is set for Monday a week.
he told me not to worry, though. Said he'd think of something.
they put me on 24-hour death watch,
so that I couldn't cheat justice like they said my wife had done.
the whole plan had been mine.
I was a svengali who had forced Doris to join
my criminal enterprise.
how I'd used Doris, then let her take the fall.
that stuff smarted because some of it was close to being true.
ladies and gentlemen, members of the jury, citizens of Santa Rosa,
we've just heard from the district attorney a rather lurid description...
of a truly despicable man.
I gotta hand it to him. He tossed a lot of sand in their eyes,
he talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe,
how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind...
the D. A. made me out to be,
how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel.
and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had the chance to trot out for Doris.
may at first look at these lines and see only the chaos of a work of modern art.
he told them to look at me, look at me close.
that the closer they looked, the less sense it would all make.
this human, this barber.
that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy,
that I was the barber, for Christ's sake.
I was just like them, an ordinary man.
guilty of living in a world that had no place for me, yeah.
guilty of wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure.
but most specifically, this is a barber's dilemma.
for he is modern man.
he said I was modern man.
he is your reflection.
and if they voted to convict me,
he told them to look not at the facts, but at the meaning of the facts.
and then he said the facts had no meaning.
it was a pretty good speech and even had me going,
what kind of man are you?
what kind of man are you?
move for a mistrial! Your honor!
what kind of man are you?
move for a mistrial.
well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry.
there was nothing left to mortgage.
Riedenschneider went home, and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway,
who threw me on the mercy of the court.
your honor, we plead guilty...
with extenuating circumstances.
it was my only chance, he said.
I guess that meant I never had a chance.
he wasn't buying any of that modern man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff,
or any of the mercy stuff either.
this man is a menace to society.
Nope, he was going by the book,
and the book said I got the chair.
he has forfeited the right to his own life.
so here I am,
at first I didn't know how I got here.
I knew step by step, of course,
which is what I've told you, step by step.
now that I'm near the end,
I'm glad that this men's magazine paid me to tell my story.
writing it has helped me sort it all out.
they're paying me flve cents a word,
so you'll pardon me if sometimes I've told you more than you wanted to know.
that's the funny thing about going away,
knowing the date you're going to die.
and the men's magazine wanted me to tell how that felt.
well, it's like pulling away from the maze.
while you're in the maze, you go throught willy-nilly,
turning where you think you have to turn,
banging into the dead ends,
one thing after another.
but you get some distance on it,
and all those twists and turns...
why, they're the shape of your life.
it's hard to explain.
but seeing it whole gives you some peace.
the men's magazine also asked about remorse.
Yeah, I guess I'm sorry about the pain I caused other people.
but I don't regret anything.
not a thing.
I used to.
I used to regret being the barber.
I don't know where I'm being taken.
I don't know what I'll find beyond the earth and sky,
but I'm not afraid to go.
maybe the things I don't understand will be clearer there,
like when a fog blows away.
maybe Doris will be there.
and maybe there I can tell her...
all those things...
they don't have words for here.
AKA: Crimewave ...and so at midnight, just 12 minutes from now mass murderer Victor Ajax will be executed at the Hudsucker State Penitentiary.
now it's Ajax's turn to die.
ajax, a security system's repair man gets death by electrocution.
thus writing finis to the horrible tale of murder and mayhem that shocked our fair city just 2 weeks ago.
claiming innocence to the end, but nothing can save Ajax now.
no...
sit down!
wait... wait... no... no... no...no!
okay, Gout.
they just fried Gurwitz.
you're next, Ajax.
but I'm innocent. Innocent, I tell ya.
don't give them the satisfaction.
Ajax!
well, good luck, kid. Give my regards to Gurwitz.
come on pipsqueak, we're saving a seat for ya!
say, you look like a couple of reasonable fellows and...
let me explain what's. . what's going on here.
I'm not supposed to be here!
it's all a big mistake.
there's no hard feelings on this end.
mistakes do happen and naturally I can explain everything.
see, I only worked for Mr. Odegard and Mr. Trend.
I was an employee in their security shop and Mr. Odegard wasn't a very nice guy and...
don't sit down, Vic!
I guess he was planning to sell the shop right out from under Mr. Trend's nose.
so tell me Odegard... Do you L-O-V-E love it?
could you die? Does it... ah... trip your alarm?
frankly, Renaldo, what you do with this shop after you've bought it doesn't interest me in the least, but let's keep this little transaction to ourselves.
I wouldn't want my partner to know he's losing his business.
somehow, Mr. Trend must have found out about it.
Mr. Trend wasn't such a bad guy, but he and his wife had sunk their whole lives into that business and...and...
Mr. Trend would have done anything for his wife...
anything.
center City Exterminators...
trend?
you there?
little weasel...
give me the word, come on, ya creep.
do it tonight, he'll be working late, alone...
and make it quick
I don't want him to suffer.
you hear that, Arthur? He doesn't want him to suffer long!
Helene, I'll never let that rat destroy our happiness.
you can count on it.
so, so you see...
I had no idea Mr. Trend was up to something nobody did, it was between the two partners
I had nothing to do with it!
if you could only find Nancy, she's my witness.
if you could only find her she'd tell you I'm totally innocent.
she'd tell you the whole time I was across the street from the shop installing the video security system in Mr. Trend's apartment building.
Mr. Trend!
honey, I'm home.
who is it?
it's me, Mr. Trend!
Oh... Hi, Vic. What's on your mind?
silliest damn thing, it's a broom closet!
well, one more camera...
Mr. Trend and it's...
back to the shop.
fine, back to the...
you know Vic, I'm glad we ran into each other in this amusing fashion.
for a long time now I've been looking to have a heart to heart with you.
you know you've always been more than just an employee to Helene and I.
honey, I'm home.
you find this work fulfilling, don't you, Vic?
and how, Mr. Trend!
but have you ever thought about the grand design?
I mean, there's something missing, isn't there, Vic?
a door, Mr. Trend?
what's behind the door, Vic?
Oh,... Oh...Jeez,...
Mr. Trend I'd love to have a foyer, but on my salary...
a large apartment is...
I'm not talking about the anteroom, Vic.
I'm talking about the little princess inside.
lord knows I'd do anything for Helene.
don't go back to the shop.
take the rest of the day off.
tonight you go out and find a little princess that you'd do anything for.
now you go out there and find yours.
Oh, Thanks, Mr. Trend.
just make sure that... she knows who's boss.
Okey-dokey, Mr. Trend.
how are you tonight, Colonel?
adequate!
hell of a storm brewing.
know how I can tell?
no, how?
steel plate. in my head.
yes sir, Korea was no picnic.
word of advice son, when you hook up 4G.
don't flirt with the filly that lives there.
she'll slap you quicker than you can say "present arms."
yes sir, there's one woman that can take care of herself...
all by herself...
all by...
taking care of yourself.
that's important, but two people taking care of each other that's romance...
romance.
let's see.
chapter one: The Perfect Woman.
of course the perfect woman is not just gonna walk into my life, Gee...
Ohhooooooooo... Holy moly!
Oh! my goodness, are you okay?
come on fuck, get outta the road!
you maniacs!
incredible, I've never seen anything like that!
are you all right? - Ah. ha. oh.
Oh its. oh, oh. you've got the key... whoops.
one more thing, chode, don't you EVER call me a maniac.
people gotta learn to watch where I'm going.
are you all right?
yeah...
are you all right?
me? Yes.
excuse me?
what?
Oh, I. I. thought you... said something.
no.
Ah...
...you didn't?
Well...Thanks again.
Um! Would you... Iike...to have...
some lunch some evening?
I'm sorry, No!
Ah, or a cup of coffee?
no, no, really... I ah...

Hey, hey!
I've got the rest of the night off and...
Renaldo!
Hiya, cupcake.
say, where were you?
I had to walk home from work.
Oh I... oh. I ran into an old army buddy and
I was detained.
Hi, I'm Vic.
glad to know you.
say, what the hell, in the neighborhood wadda you say you and I go out and drown a couple olives, huh?
well, I don't know... you.
it's a date then. 8 o'clock Rialto Cafe, eh?
well, okay!
socially, the man's a genius. I wonder if he's read this book?
bye Baby! - Goodbye Renaldo, goodbye!
jumping Jehosaphats.
in all my years in the city... I ain't seen nothing like this...
...cheap Japanese umbrella...
I am so scared...
come on Annie, let's go inside, it's a hurricane!
my eye.
I'll sue you!
holy Hanna, are you okay?
Jesus, I don't know.
look out for the [pole]!
did you see that?
did you see that?
Helene, please come away from the window.
is that Mr. Odegard's car down there?
honey, this roast is absolutely delicious.
is Mr. Odegard working late tonight?
no.
he went home.
to eat his dinner.
he was very hungry and he went home.
well, it looks like there's a light on down there.
Helene, your food's getting cold.
he's still there, honey and it's after 7 o'clock.
I didn't know you were still there, honey.
I didn't know that Mr. Odegard would be working late tonight.
wait... I think somebody's with him.
I'm going down there!
get away from that fucking window!
I'm sorry.
I'll go down.
you can't go out in this... terrible weather.
don't call anybody.
I'll see what's going on.
remember what I said.
I didn't expect him in the shop tonight.
it's a complete surprise to me.
a total surprise...
and...
you'd like that, wouldn't ya, baby?
a thousand guys would give a thousand bucks to have dinner with a girl like that.
just look at that guy.
I'm not that kind of girl!
well, with a little practice you could learn to be.
Oh, now, now. wait a minute, cupcake.
nice tie!
Ooh! $76.
okay, here's forty.
Oh, but then, I had the appetizer.
call me a sport.
I'd call you a heel!
so I'm a heel.
so what of it?
who are you?
maybe I'm just a guy who hates heels.
maybe I'm a heel who hates guys who hate heels.
Oh yeah? Well maybe I'm a guy...
Oh... ah...
loser.
Oh, oh. The eye... noodles.
go on! Go on!
what in the living hell am I doing here?
I oughta shove those binoculars down your throat.
Jiminy Kripes, how'd I ever get myself into this?
for cryin' out loud.
so long, partner...
nobody makes a fool out of Ernest Aloysius Trend.
now everything's hunky-dory.
no witnesses.
why, no, officer.
I couldn't say where he is.
Enemies?...
none that I knew of... know of...
yes...
Donald was very much beloved by all.
of course, I'm sure he's all right.
murdered?
Ernest, is everything all right?
Yeah, fine... I'm at the shop.
are you sure?
Odegard's gone... It looks like he uses the back door for the...
okay, then come on home, honeykins...
your dinner's getting cold.
OK, I'll be right home dear... goodbye.
I used to think that the key to happiness...
was the installation and repair of small electrical appliances.
but... well, I don't claim to know...
a whole lot about the grand design but lately I haven't been able to shake the feeling that something's missing and I'm not talking about the foyer or the anteroom.
cherish is the word I use to describe all the feelings that I have hiding here for you inside.
I don't know how many times I wish that I had told you.
I don't know how many times I wish that I could hold you.
I don't know how many times...
I wish that I could mould you into someone...
who could cherish me. as much as I cherish you...
I haven't seen you here before.
I like that in a woman.
you're cute.
keep talking baby, maybe you'll tell me something
I don't already know.
...I don't know how many times I wish that I could hold you.
I don't how many times I wish...
Arthur...
for all we know, this is the guy that hired us.
tell him it's a two for one sale.
so, I guess what I'm trying to say is. that the perfect woman is is pretty much in the eye of the beholder.
it's funny... just some dames dig round chuck.
when they could have prime rare.
Oh, you man you!
no one can be perfect on their own.
each person needs someone to believe in them, to see them as being someone special.
people shouldn't be afraid to take care of each other.
Nancy... today, when I saw you fall all I wanted to do was take care of you.
Hey!
he didn't...
didn't you?
foolish.
whoa.
ernest Aloysius Trend, what on earth is keeping you?
have a cab? You'll pay for that.
I don't want to break a hundred.
take your bag, sir?
no muss, no fuss... Leave the bagging to us.
spies... above.
lady, you ain't seen nothing...
yet!
put up your dukes.
what mother son's raising all that ruckus out here?
what's this?
Victor, you're a very nice guy and I appreciate what you tried to do for me tonight, but this is one woman who can take care of herself.
let's have a big round of applause for Johnny and the boys.
vic, would you lend me $36?
sure!
if I had $36...
I don't usually walk around with that much money on me!
so where on earth am I going to get $36?
ladies and gentlemen!
the winners of tonight's Rialto Dance Riot will receive $36!
play, Johnny!

cause youz about to meet the being what made it.
Mr. Yarman?
quiet down, Mrs. Trend.
there but one way to catch a rat in the dark, you wait.
rat, he just gotta show you his pink little ass.
you can't seem to catch this rat!
I'll get ya.
rat ain't been made what can get away from Mr. Yarman.
see?
it's a long road that's got no end.
to catch a rat, you gotta find him first.
right.
and rats like me are hard to find.
bon voyage, sucker.
Oh, honey, look at that man!
better not getting involved.
Hey, what's so funny? Why don't you share it with the rest of us.
Aw, go on...
Taxi! - Where to?
some night, huh?
some night? It couldn't have possibly been worse.
I almost get run over. Lose a dance contest...
Heh.
get stood up by a heel.
and spend most of the evening washing dishes to...
pay for a good time I didn't have.
it couldn't possibly have been worse.
you met me, didn't ya?
exactly.
I think things could have been a lot worst.
look at the bright side.
you and your bright side!
there is no bright side!
you're not being rational, Nancy.
of course there's a bright side.
no bright side.
no bright side.
no... bright... side!
no BRIGHT SIDE!
Nancy, I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that...
Oh!
I can take care of myself.
of course you can, Nancy...
but taking care of each other, that's what's important.
who are you?
you're ruining my day.
What'd I do?
what's all that noise?
car 9, car 9. Report to Watchtower Apartments.
domestic squabble. That is all.
come on...
who are you anyway?
come on! Come on!
come on already.
come on.
God!
use the elevator.
come on, God...
Ow!
I'm Captain of this elevator...
and we are stopping at every floor.
Whoa!
Nancy, once we get you back in your apartment and all cleaned up you'll feel like a million bucks. Here we go!
Whoa!
Arthur? - Faron?
look out!
okay, Nancy, my eyes are closed.
you can hand me that dress now.
can I open my eyes yet?
not yet!
behind you.
open up, please. It's the Police.
Where'd you get the Negro, Butch?
elevator.
what kind of paranoid schizo could kill a man in cold blood and then jelly up his face with shaving cream?
my dad!
son!
I don't know what I ever saw...
in that heel in the first place...
Oh, he's not such a bad guy, just a little confused.
am I confused too, Vic?
no, Nancy. I think your emotions are wonderful.
I wish I could be as expressive as you.
you were so free when you kissed me in the restaurant and when you slapped me.
I think you're wonderful.
I... have to get some more Sudzo for that dress.
I'll be right back.
vic?
um hmm.
I've just been thinking about what you said...
and it's very sweet but the truth is...
I haven't been completely honest with my feelings about you.
thank you for helping me tonight.
no problem.
of all the men I've known, none of them would have done what you did for me tonight.
gosh!
I just want you to know I think you're a very wonderful and a very special person.
it's not often I get a chance to meet a girl like you.
Nancy?
where are you?
Freshening... freshening up.
it sounds like that congestion's moving to your throat.
listen, I just saw Mrs. Ellroy in the hall...
and she said that there are a couple of maniacs running around with forks in their noses and she's concerned because she hasn't seen Jack or Jack junior for...for quite a while.
gracious.
Yeah, it sounds like they're a couple of real sickos.
did you hear that?
there's a couple of maniacs running loose out there.
Oh, God.
I know you can take care of yourself...
but, ah... I just thought I oughta pass it along.
well, tonight certainly has been rough on you. but...I...
I just have to tell you Nancy, for me...
it's been the most wonderful night of my life.
it probably sounds funny to... a girl like you who's met lots of swell guys and...
I know that'll sounds funny...
to a girl like you who's met
Iots of swell guys and had lots of wonderful evenings.
but... I never met a girl like you before...
but I've never met a girl like you before...
what a turkey!
I know I don't deserve you, but I just had to tell you how I felt before I... walked out of your life... forever.
take a hike, pal.
you could tell me to stay if you wanted to, but if you don't... I'll understand.
I understand.
I think he's gone.
listen I just have to get a chance to thank him before he goes.
I really love your decor.
you know, it's a terrific place you got here.
Oh, golly gee, your hair really smells terrific.
you know, I don't get a chance to talk to people like that you know...
pretty girls like you ya know.
when I was in school my mom used to let me.
they never let me talk to anybody.
you know and I hated my mom. That's why I'm killing the rodents.
because, you know, every time I kill one of those guys...
I see my mom in their face, ya know.
I never had a chance.
cause, you know, I'm a like a product of the 60's...
vietnam, napalm, libby stick, LBJ, all the way...
ya know... Kent State, pay the price, Soul on Ice.
Mrs. Trend... you better get back to your apartment there are a couple of maniacs loose in this building.
I told you never to call me that!
Arthur!
you have a rodent problem?
Hey, Arthur. Every man for himself!
Whoa!

some maniacs are after my girl...
and I wonder if you'd let me take your...
you love her, son?
Yes, sir. I reckon I do.
she sticks a little in third.
I don't claim to know a whole lot about the grand design.
those fellows are gonna suck on some abuse.
Arthur, go ahead, go on.
no, No. I know ya...

Hey, Vic? - Huh?

Tally-Ho.

Suprise... suprise!

mister, you've done some bad things and I'm gonna deal out some swift justice...
this one's for bothering my girl...
this one's for giving me this...
this one's for ruining my date and here's one for all the folks everywhere.
okay son, I give up...
please don't hit me again with that baseball bat.
I realize what I did was wrong when... well... I'm. I'm sorry.
sometimes, sorry isn't good enough.
wait, from now on I'll be good.
I swear it's the truth.
just one more chance...
well... - Please... friend?
pal?
all right... but just this once.
put 'er there buddy.
knock his brains out.
well, it look like the end of the road for you, Vic.
don't look now, but here comes an overpass!
you really tear me up, Vic. Can I call you Vic?
I mean that's the difference between me and you.
that's why you're down there and I'm up here.
you see Vic...
you believe in people and I don't.
that's why I'm gonna bash your stinkin' little skull...
Arthur?... Arthur! Why you little...
Victor!
Nancy!
Victor... save me!
Nancy!
I got ya, Nancy!
Oh, not so fast.
you can still put a stop to this.
I certainly intend to.
Ah, this is a nightmare.
and away we go!
she's going over... please... please.
I'm coming, Nancy!
hold on kid, we're almost there.
you wanna play rough, aye.
let's go.
eat guard rail, fatso.
Fatso!... I'll...
here I come.
now it's your turn, toots
Nancy... Nancy, jump! Nancy, jump!
I can't make it!
you can make it.
it's too far!
come to me, Nancy.
Nancy!
hold on! Hold on! Oh, are you all right?
Oh... No, Nancy. Please, oh, oh, ok, oh, oh.
not the ear.
hold on, Nancy...
Oh, goodness. Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?
Oh, no! Not the eye!
who were those guys anyway?
Oh, Gee. I don't know.
I mean, where'd they come from? - I can't believe you...
well, how'd they get you? - Are you okay?
Nancy, I came into your room and I thought you didn't care... about me.
Oh! Vic, I do care... you saved...
and then I hit the water so you see I'm practically a hero,...
Oh, thanks. So if it hadn't been for me there's no telling how many people those maniacs might've killed.
tell it to Saint Peter!
saint Peter? Oh yeah that's a good one!
but seriously, if you can just find Nancy she'd prove everything I've told you.
Nancy, Nancy, you probably killed her just like all the others.
she's alive, I tell ya. She was on the bridge.
I don't know what happened to her, but maybe if you ran a picture of her in the paper.
Ah! sure! Yeah, we'll run a picture of her.
Yeah! Yeah. - Next to your obit.
Yeah! Next to my...
Hallelujah... Hal-le-lu-jah...
well, I've still got five minutes.
hold it! Hold it! It's the Governor.
am I too late?
no, Governor.
thank God...
I didn't want to miss this.
Sayonara!
wait!
that man is innocent!
Nancy!
Aw, come on!
Victor, darling, I had no idea.
when you fell off that bridge, I thought you were dead.
I wandered for days.
what were you wondering about?
and then these good sisters took me in.
Hi! I'm Vic.
I was about to take my vow of eternal silence when I read about this horrible mistake in the newspapers.
I think she's lying.
can you good sisters corroborate this young lady's story?
they can't speak!
they've taken the vow of eternal silence!
too bad!
right!
she likes me!
trivia...
imdb states: "Paul L. Smith's voice was dubbed in by another actor during post-production.
but doesn't say who. The movie was shot in Detroit and George Baier was part of JJ and the Morning Crew.
on Detroit's WRIF radio in the 80's.
george did the voices of Dick the Bruiser, Popeye and several other characters.
the extra at the elevator does the Popeye voice.
faron is close to his Dick the Bruiser voice. George Baier must have done the dub.
hope you enjoyed the new transcription.
hey... Hey! Is anybody out there?
what's your poison?
tequila.
no lime, no salt. - Coming right up.
man, I never saw anybody drink tequila like that and still read the Bible.
it's exactly the kind of medicine this town needs.
you know what I mean? - I know exactly what you mean.
look, you fucking loser. You owe us two grand.
we want our fucking money.
hit him! - Pay up, fool!
asshole!
quit messing around and pay us our damn money.
back off, man. It's none of your business.
God damn it, get out of the way, or we're going to beat you, too.
Hey, mister. Step back.
that was good. - Shit.
Hey, mister. Thanks a lot. I'm Billy.
which way to the cemetery?
up that way. Over the bridge. You can't miss it.
my... My hat, mister.
my condolences.
I guess I could say a few words for our dearly departed brother from the book of Samuel.
the Lord brings death and makes alive, "he brings down to the grave and raises up.
the Lord sends poverty and wealth, he humbles, he exalts.
he raises the poor from the dust, and the needy from the ash heap, "he seats them with princes "and has them inherit a throne of honor.
Amen.
excuse me.
you read from the Bible. It was very kind of you.
Thanks.
you got a minute? I'd like to introduce you to the family.
this is my father, White Deer.
and this is my son, Junior.
this is my daughter, Kiowa.
everybody loved JJ. Did you serve together?
you could say that. - Were you in his unit?
cause I don't see you in the pictures.
you know, they say he drowned in a river. - Yeah, right.
take your hat off.
there's a heck of a nice bike out there. Who does that belong to, you?
I don't believe we've met. John Reno. A pleasure.
are you... You a friend of JJ's, are you?
Yeah, well, he's a good man. You going to stay with us long?
maybe.
well, I heard about your little adventure in town, there.
trying to help that druggie kid out?
I got to tell you, it's no offense, but you're wasting your time.
ain't much of your business.
anyway, you need anything, you let me know, all right?
you said you were from up north, is that right?
boy, boy, he's talking to you.
peace, brother. This is a time for mourning, not fighting.
Murph, not yet.
let go of me. And don't you ever touch me again.
easy, darling, I'm not going to hurt you.
prettiest girl in town, won't give me the time of day.
how you figure that, Murph?
look, I'm all broke up about JJ, just like you are. He's a friend of mine.
besides, I... I just want to warn you...
a lot of bad things happening in this town to people right now, especially folks who don't mind their own business.
you understand? Saddle up, fellas.
come see me at the dealership.
Hi, there. What can I get you, mister?
I guess I'll settle for a room. - Okay. Well, let's see.
since we only get a few customers each week, I think we can fit you in.
staying long? - How much for a week?
okay. Well, let's see. That's 50 bucks a day, and one day free for our seven-day special rate.
let's call it an even 300.
you must be here for the funeral.
JJ was a good man. Great carpenter.
used to help me with the little things around here, whenever he had the time.
if you need anything, just let me know.
will do.
is that him? - No fucking way.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's him.
that motherfucker. Who's he think he's messing with?
back off, hound dog.
he's at the hotel, boss. - He's at the hotel.
why don't you thrill me with your analysis, Murph.
what do you think he is? ATF, Fed, what?
it's kind of hard to tell.
the folks down at the funeral said he's pretty harmless.
I mean, he reads the Bible, drinks tequila. Pretty much keeps to himself.
I see.
he took us by surprise, boss. It's not going to happen again.
it better not happen again.
so from now on, it's just going to be business as usual here on this great reservation.
Yeah, right. Business as usual, boss.
you just keep a goddamn eye on our mystery man.
what? - The biker with the fucking Bible, Gomez.
pay attention.
I want you to put a couple of men on him. Especially tonight.
I don't want any problems, not with this shipment, and I don't want people thinking I'm starting to lose my grip on this miserable excuse for a town. You understand?
sure thing, boss. - Murph? Murph?
Yes, sir, boss. - Good.
come on, Reno. Come over here and ride me like the cowboy I know you are.
I'm here, darling. I'm going to saddle you up like a quarter horse.
shaved just like I like it. You taste like a peach.
heard you were a friend of JJ's.
that's right. - Well, that's real nice.
funeral's over. He's dead and buried.
so what are you still doing here?
I've got my eyes on you. Remember that.
stay out of trouble.
Oh, my lovely young bird. Hurt, angry, lonely and nowhere to fly.
he didn't drown. JJ knew something about Reno.
Oh, sweetheart, I know how close you were to JJ.
he was like a father to you.
but you have to think of the rest of the family now.
we have to be careful. Reno can do just about anything he wants to in this town.
he didn't drown.
you're upset about JJ, huh?
do you really think that Reno tried to kill him?
it's crazy. - I just can't take it anymore.
but, Kiowa, if that happened to him because of what we're trying to do, what about us?
JJ was right.
I mean, other Tribal Council members might be on Reno's side.
that's crazy.
let's see what happens. I bet JJ was right.
the Council meeting is getting ready to start, so everyone come in.
welcome, everyone. This Tribal Council is in session.
we are finally ready to decide on two proposals for this Council from last month.
I wanted to postpone today's meeting, because of JJ.
we all loved him. He was one of the most respected members of this Council.
assistant Chief Lance suggested we still discuss the Gaming 3 proposal.
the Tribal Council has carefully studied and weighed the advantages and disadvantages of both proposals.
we've had a proposal for the building of a casino on the Tribal property, by Lance's construction group.
this proposal would bring many new jobs and much revenue for our people.
however, I'm very concerned with the many negative aspects of this proposal.
for now, there's a very innovative on-line gaming alternative, proposed by the late JJ, his sister Nancy and their family.
this proposal offers more highly-skilled jobs and training for our people, and takes advantage of the gaming profits without the negative aspects.
I will recommend this proposal to the Council.
and as you all know, my veto counts. - Dan, we need to rethink this.
there is too much money on the table for this tribe to lose.
I'm sorry. My decision is final.
this is ridiculous. - Yeah. Yeah, I know.
don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.
so, how was everything?
not bad.
well, I don't know how to say this, - but you don't look like a mean, old biker. - Now, why is that?
for starters, you wear funny-looking reading glasses, and you read the Bible, and drink tequila.
and just the way you talk and treat people.
I heard about that fight this morning.
it's a really nice thing you did for that kid, Billy, and all.
so I don't want to be prying, but... - Then don't.
Hey, dude. Dude, come here. I heard you were still here, man.
I'm just... Just thought I'd let you know that... There was...
those guys you beat up, man? They work for this guy, Reno.
the guy runs the whole town. He's got everybody scared.
you know what I mean...
Reno, huh?
Yeah, man. These guys, they...
they drowned somebody in the river, if you know what I mean.
I know exactly what you mean.
you want some coffee? - No.
so what's on your mind? - Everybody's favorite citizen, Reno.
we have to do something about him. - Well, it ain't that simple.
the last time I tried to have an investigation, it was called off quickly, by that judge.
JJ's drowning was no accident.
Nancy, we're all going to miss JJ, but accusing Reno is not going to bring him back.
and it's only going to cause more problems for you.
come on, Sheriff.
now, you be careful.
stay out of Reno's way, because he's a very dangerous man.
come back anytime.
you have a nice day, okay?
that's it?
that's it.
now, when I was a boy, the government came and took me away from my mother and dad, and put me in what they call a residential school.
they cut my hair off. My hair was long.
and I couldn't speak my language.
if I spoke my language, they would beat me. That's why a lot of people my age can't speak our language anymore, because it was beaten out of us.
I am looking at the eagle up there. You share the same fate.
you are destined to soar free, above all others, carried by the wind and feared by those below.
now, in our culture, four is a sacred number because everything grows in fours.
the seed, the branches and the fruit and the leaves.
and when we pray, we pray to the Creator, we pray in four directions.
and the four winds come in four directions. So four is a very sacred number for us.
don't worry about it. Mom will take care of it.
you coming? - I'm going to wait here.
Hey, there. I'll just take some of these.
so that day my Uncle JJ drowned, he came here first, right?
so what? - I'm just asking.
look...
he came in, got a case of beer.
and the Sheriff has already asked me about that.
they said he was drunk when he drowned.
Yeah, I heard. - You know he didn't drink.
who was the beer for, then? Reno? 'Cause Reno drinks beer.
Hey, was Reno with him that day? - Look, I'm busy.
you're such a loser. - You want to pay for that?
good afternoon, miss. Can I help you with those candy bars?
I heard that you were at the Tribal Council meeting today.
what did the old fools have to say? Anything interesting?
Hey, just let him go.
I asked you a question, little lady. Anything interesting?
Yeah. But it's above your kindergarten education.
that's wasn't very nice.
you need to tell your mother something for me.
she needs to drop that idiotic gaming proposal of hers.
Hey, that's none of your business. Just let him go.
he's just fine.
how old are you, sweetheart? - Fifteen.
nice, nice, nice.
how'd you like to come hang out at the pool with me and the boys?
we sure would love to see you in a bikini.
yeah... But you know what? Maybe we don't even have to go anywhere.
Hey, hey. Come on, man. Look, I don't think this is such a good idea.
she's just a kid. - What, are you going soft on us, Hoss?
get over there and do your fucking job.
since when did we become child molesters?
just back off, man.
you just keep on riding, mister. This ain't none of your business.
everything you do from now on is my business.
you fucking asshole. We own this town, and the Sheriff included.
no, stop! He tried to helped me.
all right, man. Get out of here.
I'm fine. I think so. - Are you sure?
I'll take you home. All right? - All right.
you follow. Let's go.
why don't you come have some dinner? - My mom's a really good cook.
haven't had home cooking in a while, especially not this good.
Hey, thanks for what you did. Nobody stands up to Reno.
his family's got too many connections in this town.
people like Reno, you just got to stand up and fight back.
for some folks, it's the only thing they understand.
so you travel around on your bike all the time, and help people?
Yep. I tend to move around a lot, and things just happen along the way.
doesn't it get lonely? - Nope.
you know, you remind me so much of JJ.
he was always helping people out. - Yeah. And look what happened to him.
junior. - Soon as I'm 18, I'm getting out of here.
there's no way I'm going to end up like him.
it's a real shame that in today's day and age, we couldn't find the evil that took him.
my grandfather was born a free Indian, before the reservations, before the Civil War, before the railway, even. Now they're poisoning our youth.
and for what? The white man's evil. Alcohol, drugs and money.
greed is the evil that killed my son.
he was a good warrior for our people, and a great son.
Kiowa, honey? Why don't you take our guest outside for some fresh air?
we can have dessert later.
and you, where's your family?
well, my family is my friends and my faith.
Oh, and my bike.
well, you have friends here, now. So I guess that makes us family, huh?
it looks like it.
I know what you mean, though.
it's like you're searching for something or someone you can never find.
you have a few years to figure it all out.
but sometimes the answer is closer than you think.
well, I never knew my father, you know.
JJ always took care of me, like the father I never had.
I just miss him a lot.
it's just so unfair.
he's like here one day and then gone the next.
I just don't understand it.
sometimes things are better left alone, not understood.
that's easy for you to say. You just beat up anyone you want.
don't you have a girlfriend?
white Deer is a wise old man.
he's seen many things in his lifetime. - Yeah, he likes you.
you want to go say good night to him? - Yeah, all right.
put your weapons on the ground. Put them on the ground! Now!
nobody moves, nobody gets shot.
it's that simple.
Alex, jump down there and grab those bags.
put them on the boat, one at a time.
Hurry! Let's go! Let's go!
put it all on the boat, every single one of them. Don't miss anything.
that's it.
hold your fire, God damn it!
boss, one's getting away!
well, what are you looking at? Go get him!
bullseye Bill.
son of a bitch!
Where's he now? - On the way. Leave it.
where the hell is he? - I think we lost him.
the boss is going to kick our ass. - Shut up.
what is this?
all right, that's enough.
come on back to the boat. Come get back here, and get on board.
let's get out of here.
I want to know who the runaway was. - Sure thing, boss.
and who the hell is he? And who else knows about the deal?
got some good news for you. - That'd be a relief.
we found this.
it's pretty. What the hell is it?
Billy. The Indian kid that owes us two grand.
Oh yeah, Billy.
Murph, I want you to take some guys and find that runaway piece of shit, and I want him dead. Understand?
you got it, boss. I know just where to look for him.
good.
big night in Black River. It's Saturday night. You mind if I join you?
go ahead. Have a seat. - Let's do a shot first.
I've had this hotel for eight years now. I used to hate the big city.
now I kind of miss it. Just trying to save enough money, find me a good man and get the hell out of here.
thinking of you.
go have a drink, have fun. Did I buy you that outfit?
you can never spend too much on a good-looking woman.
right.
so what are we playing here, chief? A little eight ball?
stripes or solids?
no more killing.
I cannot be involved in this anymore. - Excuse me.
we got to be more careful. Your methods, they're crude.
they attract way too much attention. - My methods, huh?
why don't you just worry about your end of the deal?
let me worry about mine, okay?
damn, I need some more limes. I'll be right back.
Hey, little lady. Why don't you just put that pretty little ass of yours - down in this chair? - And why don't you just have a seat?
I've got to go to the kitchen. - Better than that, how about in my lap?
now, come on. - Excuse me, miss. Hold this.
so, gentlemen, is there a problem? - Yeah, you.
bottom line, you know it and I know it, is if I don't deliver this...
this casino to the boys up north on a silver platter, they're going to be pissed off.
and no matter what happens, they're going to want their money.
you understand?
Yeah, yeah. - Corner pocket.
Yeah, I thought we had the Council with us on that thing.
that casino deal, that should have been ours.
well, then why does JJ's family control the project?
did you or did you not tell me if I got JJ out of the way, the Tribal Council would be forced to give us the project?
isn't that what you told me? - Yeah, that's what I said.
all right. I hear what you're saying.
just let me see what I can do on it. - Too late for that.
you see, now, I got to wipe out the whole fucking family, just to make my point.
that's what I'm talking about, your methods, man.
Yeah. They're effective, every time. Side pocket.
thanks for coming. I wasn't sure if you'd make it or not.
I want to show you something.
look who decided to show up.
Oh, good. Perfect timing. - Hi, Dad.
so today, we have a very special guest, and he's going to talk to us about the Bible.
so I want you to say a very friendly hello to our family friend.
Hi.
all right. Do you know what this is?
the Bible.
I need these to see the words.
show me your ways, oh Lord.
teach me your paths. Remember not the sins of my youth "and my rebellious ways. Good and upright is the Lord.
therefore, he instructs sinners in his ways.
he guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.
you see, the Bible, it's like a guidebook.
it helps us lead a good, honest life.
mom, come down here! Hurry!
Oh, man, I didn't... I didn't mean to...
I didn't know where else to go. - Let's get him to the house.
you're lucky to be alive. We got to get him to a clinic.
no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait a second.
hold this.
let's go, kids.
go!
I knew about this drug deal going on, down... Down by the river.
I was just hoping I could make a score, you know?
but I didn't know Reno was going to be there.
and I sure as shit didn't know he was going to be killing everybody.
shit.
Reno's guys, they were chasing me through the woods, man.
my necklace! I lost my necklace! Fuck!
shit! Oh, fuck, it is them! - Stay inside no matter what happens.
this is serious business, mister.
we don't want any trouble from you.
we're looking for an Indian, Billy.
he was shot, and we heard he was around here somewhere.
he stole something from us. We need to find him.
go ahead and call the Sheriff. You can use the phone inside.
no can do, mister. But you know that.
no, this is our problem, and we're gonna deal with it ourselves, the old-fashioned way.
well, I'm sorry. Can't help you boys.
well, it looks like we might have ourselves a little problem here, now, don't we?
it was the kids that told us where the bleeding Indian was by the old campground.
you should have seen those little runts shitting themselves.
when I got a job to do, nobody better stand in my way.
so you better back the fuck off and move on, or else...
what you gonna do now, preacher man?
well, I'm going to ask you to beg the good Lord's forgiveness, but not before I take this knee and break that nose.
and you know what?
what?
there ain't nothing you can do about it.
fuck you.
you don't know how to use that.
well, that's one way of using it.
okay! Okay! We get your point! We get your point!
all right. Drop your pants.
wait a minute. - Drop 'em!
drop your pants. You, too. Go ahead!
now, get out of here.
asshole! - Fucker!
be sure to take them someplace safe.
don't worry. Not even Reno knows of this place.
our ancestors always spoke of a man that would come from the north, followed by the evil. Take care, my friend.
my prayers are with you.
this is it, isn't it?
I'm never going to see you again, no matter what.
sometimes it's better this way.
let's go.
you got a choice to make.
we'll help you out. But after you go to the doctor, you have to testify against Reno.
otherwise, you can go out there right now, and deal with Reno yourself.
all right. Okay, fine. I'll do it.
otherwise, I'm a dead man, right?
we've got an assault and battery, here, at Route 61.
sending in backup.
witness reports that Reno's men were seen leaving the area, so keep an eye out. 10-4.
sheriff, we have Reno cold. Billy was shot last night.
you have what? - You have to go and arrest him.
he ain't exactly the best witness. - Billy saw Reno commit murder.
afternoon, folks. You having a little pow-wow out here?
hell, I wish I'd known, I'd put an eagle feather in my hat.
you got a van full of sick kids, Sheriff? - What do you want, Reno?
well, since you asked so kindly, a couple of my men are thinking about filing assault charges against this one, here, for beating the shit out of 'em.
I'm thinking about filing vandalism charges for damage done to my vehicle up on the Adobe Flats.
hell, I've already talked to a judge.
self-defense, as the Lord is my witness.
well, let's talk about that, you and me.
let's say we go have a drink at my bar and talk things over.
sure, why not? - Good. Follow me.
y'all have a good afternoon.
relax. Everybody relax.
I'm going to have a little talk with my friend, here.
have a little drink.
see if we can work something out. Give me a beer.
and then give this man whatever he wants.
gracias. - Tequila, straight up. No lime, no salt.
look, here it is.
I don't give a fuck who you are or where you came from.
I damn sure don't give a fuck why you're here.
the way I see it, we got three options.
first is, I can just kill you now, and be done with it.
the second, you can walk out of this bar alive, get on your iron horse, and ride out of town.
never look back. And when you're gone, you stay gone.
third option, and for my money, the most interesting, is you could come to work for me.
hell, I could use a man with your skills and your... How did you put that, Gomez?
your spiritual disposition.
might even help my reputation. What do you say?
first, your reputation is bad. It's always going to be bad, no matter who works for you.
second, I don't like people that take advantage of others for power and money.
and, third,
I don't like you, Reno.
well, I'll take that as a "no.
thanks for the drink.
don't walk away from me. - Hold it.
wait, wait, wait! This holy man's day of reckoning is at hand.
stop! I said stop, God damn it. Nobody walks out on me.
hold it! That's enough.
now put your weapon down.
sheriff, what do you think you're doing? - Put your gun down or I'll put you down.
let's go find a little Indian boy to scalp.
back in the bar. Move it.
damn, that was stupid.
now Reno's got me in his sights, too.
Yep.
I got to find your missing witness before Reno does.
all right, Sheriff.
I knew you'd come back.
that's the gun they shot you with.
I got something else for you.
all my enemies are driven back. They shall fall and perish at thy presence.
Murphy, I'm not interrupting you, am I?
did you make my call for me?
Yeah, yeah, I did, boss. They'll be here tonight.
well, good, good. That's grand. It's about fucking time, too.
should have done this a long time ago. Sugar plum? Honey?
you don't mind if we talk a little business, do you?
all right. - Move it!
so, what did my buddy up north have to say?
Hurry!
thanks for coming, partner. Glad you're here.
the crew does look good.
I see you still got the twins with you, and they are still riding their own material.
never leave home without them. - Business going well, I take it?
everything going smooth up north? - I got no problems here.
you know, the usual, some killing, some fucking. Lots of hard partying.
that's what pays off in this business. - Every time.
my problem is, I got a witness.
he's just a local Indian boy named Billy, but he saw one of my drug raids go down.
and just seeing it go down, it's no big deal in and of itself, but this one got ugly.
it got messy in a hurry, and somebody shot one of my men.
all hell broke loose, and everybody died.
you fucked up. Killing dealers wasn't part of the plan.
now, the Mexicans are going to want payback, and these Mexicans don't fuck around.
you took their money. You took their drugs.
you probably killed somebody's fucking cousin.
what were you thinking?
you still got the money and the drugs? - Yeah, sure.
this is what we're going to do.
we're going to pin it on the Indian kid.
put the money and the drugs on him. Make sure the Sheriff finds him that way.
dead, with all the shit on him. - That's a damn good idea.
you think so, Reno? - Yep.
I don't know, 'cause you still seem nervous. Is there something you're not telling me?
a couple of days ago, this old boy comes riding into town on a strange-looking bike.
he starts beating up my men, shooting up my bar, causing me all kinds of trouble every day of the week.
big, tall, rough-looking bastard. Military training for sure.
and here's the weird thing.
he carries a Bible around with him everywhere he goes.
did you say he had a Bible?
how do you know it wasn't just a big book?
no, it was a Bible for sure. My men even tell me he reads from it.
is it a tall guy, blonde hair, old Hog? - Yeah. Yeah, that's him exactly!
lmpossible, I knew a guy like that once, but that guy's dead.
he's dead?
well, you fucked up, because he's alive, and he's kicking my ass.
I fucked up? Huh? I fucked up?
no, 'cause the way I see it, Reno, the only one that's fucking up around here is you.
drug dealers are dead. Business is dead.
you got a murder witness running around free that should be dead.
and to top it all off, we still don't have a fucking casino!
you got a nice place here, Reno.
I hope you don't mind if I live here when you're dead.
come on. Let's go, you pieces of white trash. Going to Black River.
I wonder if my kids are okay. - They're in good hands.
white Deer is a wise old man.
you remind me of their father.
every day I see their faces and I think of him, and remember him and how much they miss him.
Really? - He was killed by a biker gang.
look, maybe something good will come out of what I have to do here.
just remember to make the most of it.
can't you wait till morning? Please don't go.
it's a nightmare.
you must be Billy.
nobody else could be stupid enough to sit on my bike.
Yeah, I'm Billy.
who the fuck are you?
my name is Jarfe. - That's a funny name. Jarfe.
you know, there's a funny story that goes with that.
well, my mother and father, they were really bad drunks.
and the last thing she gave me before she died giving birth to me was this fucked-up name.
now, long story short, she's at the hospital, on a table, legs up in the stirrups, and I come popping out.
the nurse turns to her and says, "What do you want to name him?
now, she meant to say "Jeff.
but she was just so drunk and beaten, you know, the old man busted her jaw, that it came out "Jarfe.
and then she died a few minutes later.
so, I guess you could say I came into this world a little fucked up, huh?
Yeah.
all right, I want you to have this, right here.
I don't do drugs, Billy, they're bad for you.
man, please.
if this is about the other night, please, man.
I promise I won't tell nobody. I won't tell nobody, please.
let me talk to Reno. I talk to Reno, please, man.
you redskin fucks'll never learn. This is a white man's world.
not so fast. You got an old biker staying here.
tall guy, blonde? Reads the Bible. - Screw you.
that's the idea. Listen, you dirty, little whore.
maybe you'd like to have this conversation in private.
I'm not a whore. - That's what they all say.
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, up against the wall, asshole.
is there a problem, officer? - I said up against the wall!
I'm sorry, did you say something?
Kiowa, come back here! Come back. - No, I'm going to help him.
there he is!
where do you think you're going?
Billy's, uh... - Yeah, I know.
dead. - So are my two deputies.
and you're not going in there.
all right, Sheriff.
but under the circumstances, I'll make an exception.
they're on the other side of town, - by the bank. - Thank you, Dan.
put your tampon back in and go let them know.
all right, let's go.
come on.
he's coming! He's coming!
hey man, over there.
you, go that way. You, go that way.
not even God himself can save the holy man of this piece-of-shit town from me.
I'll burn this fucking place to the ground.
can't anybody kill this fucking guy? Go!
you gonna just sit there? Let's go.
Freeze! Nobody move!
do you have any idea how hard it is to find good help?
your holy man ought to be dead, and so should you.
I said, don't move.
come on.
what you got?
they're all dead.
all of them? - Well, they look dead to me.
if not dead, really fucked up.
it's impossible. It can't be you.
it's me.
it's all there. The drugs and the money.
your cousin judge ain't going to help you now.
fine.
man ON TV: Although each of the world's countries would like to dispute this fact, we French know the truth:
the best food in the world is made in France.
the best food in France is made in Paris.
and the best food in Paris, some say, is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.
Gusteau's restaurant is the toast of Paris, booked five months in advance.
and his dazzling ascent to the top of fine French cuisine has made his competitors envious.
he is the youngest chef ever to achieve a five-star rating.
chef Gusteau's cookbook, Anyone Can Cook!
climbed to the top of the bestseller list.
but not everyone celebrates its success.
amusing title, " Anyone Can Cook " !
what's even more amusing is that Gusteau actually seems to believe it.
I, on the other hand, take cooking seriously.
and, no, I don't think anyone can do it.
this is me.
I think it's apparent I need to rethink my life a little bit.
what's my problem?
first of all, I'm a rat.
which means life is hard.
and second, I have a highly developed sense of taste and smell.
flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...
Oh! Small twist of lemon.
whoa, you can smell all that? You have a gift.
this is Emile, my brother. He's easily impressed.
so you can smell ingredients? So what?
this is my dad. He's never impressed.
he also happens to be the leader of our clan.
so, what's wrong with having highly developed senses?
whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that! - What's going on here?
turns out that funny smell was rat poison.
suddenly, Dad didn't think my talent was useless.
I was feeling pretty good about my gift, until Dad gave me a job.
clean.
clean.
that's right. Poison checker.
Cleanerific.
Cleanerino.
close to godliness.
which means clean. You know, cleanliness is close to...
never mind. Move on.
well, it made my dad proud.
now, don't you feel better, Remy? You've helped a noble cause.
noble? We're thieves, Dad.
and what we're stealing is, let's face it, garbage.
it isn't stealing if no one wants it.
if no one wants it, why are we stealing it?
let's just say we have different points of view.
this much I knew:
if you are what you eat, then I only want to eat the good stuff.
but to my dad...
food is fuel.
you get picky about what you put in the tank, your engine is gonna die.
now shut up and eat your garbage.
look, if we're going to be thieves, why not steal the good stuff in the kitchen, where nothing is poisoned?
first of all, we are not thieves.
secondly, stay out of the kitchen and away from the humans.
it's dangerous.
I know I'm supposed to hate humans, but there's something about them.
they don't just survive. They discover, they create.
I mean, just look at what they do with food.
how can I describe it?
good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell.
there is excellence all around you.
you need only be aware to stop and savor it.
Oh, Gusteau was right.
Oh, mmm, yeah.
Oh, amazing.
each flavor was totally unique.
but combine one flavor with another, and something new was created.
so now I had a secret life.
the only one who knew about it was Emile.
Hey, Emile. Emile.
I found a mushroom.
come on, you're good at hiding food. Help me find a good place to put this.
he doesn't understand me, but I can be myself around him.
why are you walking like that?
I don't want to constantly have to wash my paws.
did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws that we handle food with?
you ever think about what we put into our mouths?
all the time.
when I eat, I don't want to taste everywhere my paws have been.
well, go ahead.
but if Dad sees you walking like that, he's not going to like it.
what have you got there?
Ah, oh, oh...
you found cheese?
and not just any cheese.
that would go beautifully with my mushroom.
and...
this rosemary! This rosemary with maybe with a few drops from this sweet grass.
well, throw it on the pile, I guess, and then we'll... You know...
we don't want to throw this in with the garbage. This is special.
but we're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or, you know, Dad's gonna...
Emile!
there are possibilities unexplored here.
we got to cook this.
now, exactly how we cook this is the real question...
Yeah.
the key is to keep turning it.
get the smoky flavor nice and even.
that storm's getting closer.
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe we shouldn't be so...
you got to taste this!
this is... It's got this kind of... It's burny, melty...
it's not really a smoky taste. It's a certain... It's kind of like a...
it's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap" kind of taste. Don't you think?
what would you call that flavor? - Lightning-y?
Yeah. It's lightning-y! We got to do that again.
okay, when the next storm comes, we'll go up on the roof...
I know what this needs! Saffron! A little saffron would make this!
saffron. Why do I get the feeling - it's in the kitchen? - It's in the kitchen.
REMY: Saffron. - Not good.
saffron.
don't like it. She's gonna wake up.
I've been down here a million times.
she turns on the cooking channel, boom, she never wakes up.
you've been here a million times?
I'm telling you, saffron will be just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.
okay. Who's Gusteau?
just the greatest chef in the world. Wrote this cookbook.
wait. You read?
well, not excessively. - Oh, man. Does Dad know?
you could fill a book, a lot of books, with things Dad doesn't know.
and they have, which is why I read. Which is also our secret.
I don't like secrets.
all this cooking and reading and TV-watching while we read and cook.
it's like you're involving me in crime, and I let you.
why do I let you?
what's taking those kids so long?
Ah, I'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?
Gusteau says it's excellent. Good thing the old lady is a food love...
Gusteau ON TV: Forget mystique. This is about your cooking.
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.
great cooking is not for the faint of heart.
great cooking is not for the faint of heart.
you must be imaginative, strong hearted.
you must try things that may not work.
and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from.
your only limit is your soul.
what I say is true. Anyone can cook. But only the fearless can be great.
pure poetry.
but it was not to last.
Gusteau's restaurant lost one of its five stars after a scathing review by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.
it was a severe blow to Gusteau, and the brokenhearted chef died shortly afterwards, which, according to tradition, meant the loss of another star.
Gusteau is dead?
Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Oh!
run!
no, you'll lead her to the colony!
help, Remy, help! - Emile! Start swinging the light!
help, Remy, help! - Emile! Start swinging the light!
try to grab you.
Emile, swing to me.
evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.
let me through! - The book.
let me through! - The book.
excuse me. Move, move.
go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.
get the bridge up! Move it, move it!
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!
push off. Come on.
get hold!
take the baby. Here! - Give me your paw.
Hey, wait for me!
is everybody here? Do we have everybody?
wait a minute. Where's Remy? - Right here. I'm coming.
I'm coming!
hold on, Son. Give him something to grab on to.
come on, boy. Paddle, Son.
come on. Reach for it.
you can do it.
Remy! - Dad!
come on. You can make it. You can make it.
guys, wait. Stop!
Remy. Come on. Paddle.
hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.
dad?
dad?
which way?
I waited for a sound, a voice, a sign, something.
if you are hungry, go up and look around, Remy.
why do you wait and mope?
well, I've just lost my family, all my friends, probably forever.
how do you know? - Well, I...
you are an illustration. Why am I talking to you?
well, you just lost your family, all your friends. You are lonely.
Yeah. Well, you're dead.
Ah, but that is no match for wishful thinking.
if you focus on what you've left behind, you'll never be able to see what lies ahead.
now go up and look around.
Oh!
woman: Champagne!
what are you doing?
I'm hungry.
I don't know where I am, and I don't know when I'll find food again.
Remy, you are better than that. You are a cook.
a cook makes. A thief takes. You are not a thief.
but I am hungry.
food will come, Remy.
food always comes to those who love to cook.
you think I am playing? - You don't have the guts.
Paris?
all this time I've been underneath Paris?
Wow.
it's beautiful.
the most beautiful.
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?
you've led me to your restaurant.
it seems as though I have. Yes. There it is! I have led you to it!
I got to see this.
ready to go on table seven. Coming around.
one order of steamed pike up. MAN: Coming up.
I need more soup bowls, please.
I need two rack of lamb. I need more leeks.
I need two salmon, three salade composee, and three filet.
three orders of salade composee working.
firing two orders, seared salmon.
three filet working. I need plates.
fire seven. Three salade composee up.
don't mess with my mise!
open down low.
I'm getting buried here.
Hello, Chef Skinner. How your night be now?
Bonjour, chef. LAROUSSE: Hello, Chef Skinner.
evening, chef. - Ordering deux filet.
Hey, boss, look who is here.
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.
Hi. - All grown up, eh?
you remember Renata, Gusteau's old flame?
Yes. How are you... - Linguini.
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit. How is...
my mother? - Renata.
Yes, Renata. How is she? - Good.
well, not... She's been better. I mean...
she died.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven, so she's covered.
you know, afterlife-wise?
what's this? - She left it for you.
I think she hoped it would help me, you know, get a job here.
but of course. Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.
any son of Renata's is more than...
Yes, well, we could file this and if something suitable opens up...
we have already hired him.
what? How dare you hire someone without my...
we needed a garbage boy.
Oh, garbage. Well...
I'm glad it worked out.
uh...
I can't believe it.
a real gourmet kitchen, and I get to watch.
you've read my book. Let us see how much you know, huh?
which one is the chef?
Oh! Uh...
Oh, that guy. - Very good.
who is next in command?
the sous chef. There.
the sous is responsible for the kitchen when the chef's not around.
saucier, in charge of sauces. Very important.
both important.
commis, commis, they're cooks. Very important.
you are a clever rat. Now, who is that?
Oh, him? He's nobody.
not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.
no, he's a plongeur or something.
he washes dishes or takes out the garbage. He doesn't cook.
but he could. - Uh, no.
how do you know? What do I always say?
anyone can cook.
well, yeah, anyone can. That doesn't mean that anyone should.
well, that is not stopping him. See?
what is he doing? No. No! No, this is terrible!
he's ruining the soup. And nobody's noticing?
it's your restaurant. Do something.
what can I do? I am a figment of your imagination.
but he's ruining the soup! We got to tell someone that he's...
but he's ruining the soup! We got to tell someone that he's...
table five coming up, right now.
coming down the line. --Set.
Ah!
hot! Open oven!
Ah!
coming around.
Ooh!
Oui, chef. One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.
fire those souffles for table six, ja.
five minutes, chef. - Oh, God.
tonight, I'd like to present the foie gras.
it has a wonderful finish.
Ooh! -Ah!
hmm.
ready to go on table seven. Come on! Let's go!
Oui, chef.
Remy! What are you waiting for?
is this going to become a regular thing with you?
you know how to fix it. This is your chance.
the soup! Where is the soup? Out of my way.
move it, garbage boy!
you are cooking?
how dare you cook in my kitchen?
where do you get the gall to even attempt something so monumentally idiotic?
I should have you drawn and quartered!
I'll do it. I think the law is on my side.
Larousse, draw and quarter this man after you put him in the duck press to squeeze the fat out of his head.
what are you blathering about? - The soup!
soup?
stop that soup!
No!
waiter.
Linguini!
you're fired!
F-l-R-E-D! Fired!
she wants to see the chef.
but he...
what did the customer say? - It was not a customer. It was a critic.
ego? - Solene LeClaire.
LeClaire? What did she say? - She likes the soup.
wait. - What do you mean, "Wait"?
you're the reason I'm in this mess.
someone is asking about your soup.
what are you playing at?
am I still fired?
you can't fire him. - What?
LeClaire likes it, yeah? She made a point of telling you so.
if she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the cook responsible...
he's a garbage boy. - Who made something she liked.
how can we claim to represent the name of Gusteau if we don't uphold his most cherished belief?
and what belief is that, Mademoiselle Tatou?
anyone can cook.
perhaps I have been a bit harsh on our new garbage boy.
he has taken a bold risk and we should reward that, as Chef Gusteau would have.
if he wishes to swim in dangerous waters, who are we to deny him?
you were escaping? - Oh, yeah.
since you have expressed such an interest in his cooking career, you shall be responsible for it.
anyone else?
then back to work.
you are either very lucky or very unlucky.
you will make the soup again, and this time, I'll be paying attention.
very close attention.
they think you might be a cook. But you know what I think, Linguini?
I think you are a sneaky, overreaching little...
rat!
rat! --Get the rat.
Linguini. Get something to trap it.
it's getting away. Get it, get it, get it.
what should I do now? - Kill it.
now? - No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?
do you know what would happen to us if anyone knew we had a rat in our kitchen?
they'd close us down.
our reputation is hanging by a thread as it is.
take it away from here. Far away. Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!
Whoa!
doh!
don't look at me like that! You aren't the only one who's trapped.
they expect me to cook it again!
I mean, I'm not ambitious. I wasn't trying to cook.
I was just trying to stay out of trouble.
you're the one who was getting fancy with the spices!
what did you throw in there? Oregano? No? What? Rosemary?
that's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?
you didn't throw rosemary in there?
then what was all the flipping and all the throwing the...
I need this job. I've lost so many.
I don't know how to cook, and now I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...
did you nod?
have you been nodding?
you understand me?
so I'm not crazy!
wait a second, wait a second.
I can't cook, can I?
but you...
you can, right?
look, don't be so modest. You're a rat, for Pete's sake.
whatever you did, they liked it.
Yeah. This could work.
Hey, they liked the soup!
they liked the soup. Do you think you could do it again?
okay, I'm going to let you out now.
but we're together on this. Right?
okay.
so this is it.
I mean, it's not much, but it's, you know...
not much.
it could be worse.
there's heat and light and a couch with a TV.
so, you know, what's mine is yours.
are you...
is this a dream?
the best kind of dream.
one we can share.
but why here?
why now?
why not here?
why not now?
what better place to dream than in Paris?
morning, Little Chef. Rise and...
Oh, no.
idiot! I knew this would happen!
I let a rat into my place and tell him what's mine is his!
eggs, gone!
stupid! He's stolen food and hit the road! What did I expect?
that's what I get for trusting a...
Hi. Is that for me?
Mmm!
that's good. What did you put in this?
Where'd you get that?
look, it's delicious. But don't steal. I'll buy some spices, okay?
Oh, no. We're going to be late. And on the first day!
come on, Little Chef!
though I, like many other critic had written off Gusteau as irrelevant since the great chef's death, the soup was a revelation. A spicy yet subtle taste experience.
solene LeClaire? - Yes!
against all odds, Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.
only time will tell if they deserve it.
well...
you know.
look, I know it's stupid and weird, but neither of us can do this alone, so we got to do it together, right? You with me?
so let's do this thing!
I...
welcome to hell. Now, recreate the soup.
take as much time as you need. All week if you must.
soup.
you little...
Ow!
you son of a...
you got...
this is not going to work, Little Chef!
I'm going to lose it if we do this anymore.
we've got to figure out something else.
something that doesn't involve any biting, or nipping, or running up and down my body with your little rat feet.
the biting! No! Scampering! No!
no scampering or scurrying. Understand, Little Chef?
little Chef?
Oh, you're hungry.
okay. So let's think this out.
you know how to cook, and I know how to appear human.
we need to work out a system so that I do what you want in a way that doesn't look like I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.
would you listen to me? I'm insane! I'm insane! I'm insane!
in a refrigerator talking to a rat about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.
I will never pull this off! - Linguini?
we gotta communicate.
I can't be constantly checking for a yes or no head shake from a...
the rat! I saw it!
a rat? - Yes, a rat. Right next to you.
what are you doing in here?
I'm just familiarizing myself with, you know, the vegetables and such.
get out.
one can get too familiar with vegetables, you know!
that was close. Are you okay up there?
Whoa!
how did you do that?
that's strangely involuntary!
one look and I knew we had the same crazy idea.
okay.
huh?
where are you taking me? Wait.
Whoa!
wait. I'm sorry.
Whoa!
okay.
Mmm-hmm...
okay.
Whoa!
Whoa!
a votre sante!
all right.
that should do it.
Mmm.
Congratulations. You were able to repeat your accidental success.
but you'll need to know more than soup if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.
colette will be responsible for teaching you how we do things here.
listen, I just want you to know how honored I am to be studying under such...
No! You listen. I just want you to know exactly who you are dealing with.
how many women do you see in this kitchen?
well, I...
only me. Why do you think that is? - Well, I...
because haute cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy built upon rules written by stupid old men.
rules designed to make it impossible for women to enter this world.
but still I'm here. How did this happen?
because, well, because you...
because I am the toughest cook in this kitchen.
I've worked too hard for too long to get here and I am not going to jeopardize it for some garbage boy who got lucky.
got it?
Wow!
easy to cook. Easy to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food
Chinese-easy.
excellent work, Francois, as usual. - It's good, isn't it?
I want you to work up something for my latest frozen food concept.
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.
they're like corn dogs, only smaller. Bite size.
what are corn dogs?
cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried. You know, American.
cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried. You know, American.
whip something up.
maybe Gusteau in overalls and Huckleberry Tom hat.
or as a big ear of corn in doggie make-up.
Yes. But, please, with dignity.
get my lawyer!
well, the will stipulates that if after a period of two years from the date of death no heir appears,
Gusteau's business interests will pass to his sous chef. You.
I know what the will stipulates.
what I want to know is if this letter... If this boy changes anything!
there's not much resemblance.
there's no resemblance at all. He is not Gusteau's son.
Gusteau had no children, and what of the timing of all this?
the deadline in the will expires in less than a month!
suddenly, some boy arrives with a letter from his recently deceased mother claiming Gusteau is his father?
highly suspect!
this is Gusteau's? - Yes, yes, yes.
may I? - Of course.
but the boy does not know.
she claims she never told him, or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.
why you? What does she want? - A job for the boy.
only a job? - Well, yes.
then what are you worried about? If he works here, you'll be able to keep an eye on him while I do a little digging.
find out how much of this is real.
I will need you to collect some DNA samples from the boy. Hair, maybe.
mark my words. The whole thing is highly suspect.
he knows something.
relax, he's a garbage boy. I think you can handle him.
what are you doing?
I'm cutting vegetables. I'm cutting vegetables?
No! You waste energy and time!
you think cooking is a cute job, like Mommy in the kitchen?
well, Mommy never had to face the dinner rush when the orders come flooding in, and every dish is different and none are simple, and all of the different cooking times, but must arrive on the customer's table at exactly the same time, hot and perfect!
every second counts, and you cannot be Mommy!
what is this? Keep your station clear!
when the meal rush comes, what will happen?
messy stations slow things down.
food doesn't go, orders pile up. Disaster.
I'll make this easy to remember.
keep your station clear, or I will kill you!
your sleeves look like you threw up on them.
keep your hands and arms in, close to the body. Like this. See?
always return to this position.
cooks move fast. Sharp utensils, hot metal, keep your arms in.
you will minimize cuts and burns and keep your sleeves clean.
mark of a chef: Messy apron, clean sleeves.
I know the Gusteau style cold.
in every dish, Chef Gusteau always has something unexpected.
I will show you. I memorize all his recipe.
always do something unexpected. - No. Follow the recipe.
but you just said that... - No, no, no.
it was his job to be unexpected. It is our job to...
follow his recipes. - Follow the recipe.
how do you tell how good bread is without tasting it?
not the smell, not the look, but the sound of the crust.
listen.
symphony of crackle. Only great bread sound this way.
the only way to get the best produce is to have first pick of the day and there are only two way to get first pick.
grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.
voila! The best restaurant get first pick.
people think haute cuisine is snooty. So chef must also be snooty.
but not so. Lalo there ran away from home at 12.
got hired by circus people as an acrobat.
and then he get fired for messing around with the ringmaster's daughter.
horst has done time.
LINGUINl: What for?
no one know for sure. He changes the story every time you ask him.
I defrauded a major corporation.
I robbed the second largest bank in France using only a ballpoint pen.
I created a hole in the ozone over Avignon.
I killed a man with this thumb.
COLETTE: Don't ever play cards with Pompidou.
he's been banned from Las Vegas and Monte Carlo.
larousse ran gun for the Resistance. - Which resistance?
he won't say. Apparently, they didn't win.
so you see.
we are artist, pirate. More than cooks are we.
we? - Oui. You are one of us now, oui?
Oui. Thank you, by the way, for all the advice about cooking.
thank you, too. - For what?
for taking it.
huh?
the rat!
but he is a... - I just dropped my keys.
have you decided this evening?
your soup is excellent. But... - But we order it every time.
what else do you have? - Well, we have a very nice foie gras.
I know about the foie gras.
the old standby, used to be famous for it.
what does the chef have that's new?
someone has asked what is new! - New?
Yes. What do I tell them?
well, what did you tell them? - I told them I would ask!
what are you blathering about?
customers are asking what is new. - What should I tell them?
what did you tell them? - I told them I would ask!
this is simple.
just pull out an old Gusteau recipe, something we haven't made in a while...
they know about the old stuff. They like Linguini's soup.
they are asking for food from Linguini?
a lot of customers like the soup. That's all we are saying.
were we saying that?
very well. If it's Linguini they want tell them Chef Linguini has prepared something special for them.
something definitely off menu.
Oh, and don't forget to stress - its Linguini-ness. - Oui, chef.
now is your chance to try something worthy of your talent, Linguini.
a forgotten favorite of the chef's, sweetbread a la Gusteau.
colette will help you. - Oui, chef.
now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.
are you sure? That recipe was a disaster.
Gusteau himself said so.
just the sort of challenge a budding chef needs.
sweetbread a la Gusteau.
sweetbread cooked in a seaweed salt crust "with cuttlefish tentacle, dog rose puree, "geoduck egg, dried white fungus?
anchovy licorice sauce.
I don't know this recipe, but it's Gusteau's, so...
Lalo! We have some veal stomach soaking, yes?
Yes! The veal stomach, I get that.
veal stomach?
Oh!
okay.
I'll be right back. Where...
Hey, I got to... Hey!
don't mind me. I just need to borrow this real quick.
let's see, over here...
I'll be back.
thank you.
excuse me. I'm going to...
apparently, I need this. I'll be right...
I'm going to pick that up.
I got some of that spice.
okay.
what are you doing? You're supposed to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.
this is the recipe.
the recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil!
what else have you... You are improvising?
this is no time to experiment. The customer are waiting.
you're right. I should listen to you!
stop that! - Stop what?
freaking me out! Whatever you are doing, stop it.
where is the special order? - Coming!
I thought we were together on this. - We are together.
then what are you doing? - It's very hard to explain.
the special? - Come get it!
whoa, whoa. I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.
don't you dare. - I'm not, I'm not. I'm...
sorry.
is Linguini's dish done yet?
ja. It's as bad as we remember. Just went out.
did you taste it? - Ja, of course, before he changed it.
good. What? How could he change it?
he changed it as it was going out the door!
Ow!
they love it!
other diners are already asking about it, about Linguini.
I have seven more orders!
that's wonderful.
I'd like one of those.
special order!
what is that?
special order! Special order! Special order!
to Linguini.
congratulations, Mr. Linguini. - Cheers, ja?
drink now, there's plenty.
take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.
we really did it tonight.
dah!
got your toque!
Oh, seriously now.
I'd love to have a little talk with you, Linguini, in my office.
am I in trouble? - Trouble? No.
a little wine, a friendly chat. Just us cooks.
the plongeur won't be coming to you for advice anymore, eh, Colette?
he's gotten all he needs.
toasting your success, eh, Linguini?
good for you.
I just took it to be polite. I don't really drink, you know.
of course you don't. I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.
but you would have to be an idiot of elephantine proportions not to appreciate this '61 Chateau Latour.
and you, Monsieur Linguini, are no idiot.
let us toast your non-idiocy.
Remy! - Emile?
I can't believe it! You're alive!
you made it! - I thought I'd never see you guys again!
we figured you didn't survive the rapids.
and what are you eating?
I don't really know.
I think it was some sort of wrapper once.
what? No. You're in Paris now, baby. My town.
no brother of mine eats rejectamenta in my town.
Remy! You are stealing? You told Linguini he could trust you.
and he can. It's for my brother. - But the boy could lose his job.
which means I would, too. It's under control, okay?
more wine? - I shouldn't, but... Okay.
so, where did you train, Linguini?
train? All right.
come in, please.
Pierre, it's a call from France, it's urgent.
tell him call after the concert.
it's about your mother.
Hello?

Ah, it's you who was little and in first raw
and this is you.
and the warden, what's his name?
clement Mathieu
clement Mathieu
how was he later?
open it.
bottom of Pond" -- year 1949
this is the diary written by Mathieu, in the period of "Bottom of Pond."
about his story, and ours.
he designated you to keep it.
I thought it should be saved as historical files. However...
1949, Jan. 15th.
after all the frustration in all the fields,
I'm sure the bottom of my life was coming.
it was a boarding school, especially setted up for the "re-eduction" of problematic youngster.
at least so as it said on the want ad.
b o P
even the name of the school seems just chose for me.
good morning.
you are alone?
what are you doing there?
I'm waiting for the coming of Saturday.
Why?
because my father will come to take me.
but today is not Saturday.
Pepinot!
how are you. I'm Clement Mathieu, new warden.
how long have you work as a warden?
I used to work in a private school.
what did you teach? -Music.
Ah, so you will get on well with Mr. Hason -En?
the principal, he was a bugler before.
Really?
these are his daughters, he lives here.
have you seen Mr. Hason before? -Not yet, I was assigned to this job.
Really?
and he is uncle Maxence
he explain me my duty just on my arrival.
he's at the same time the guard, the nurse, the storehouse-man, and repairer.
what is he doing now?
this is the student's punished by Mr. Hason 15 days campus serving, or cleaning.
what's about the children on earth?
didn't they tell you?
no.
this is the medicine room. I will show you our little kailyard.
OK.
Basterd, what's wrong with you? Another trick? -Let's me help you...
are you Clement Mathieu?
Mr. principal.
Hason, the principal.
Ah, Mr. principal, I am sorry.
Yes, you are late.
they gave me the wrong train timetable. -Keeping on time is the basic principle here.
Yes.
Mr. principal.
Yes, Mr. principal.
OK, follow me.
at first, you should learn something about our principles. Then begin your lesson on 4 o'clock this afternoon.
what are you doing again, answer me.
take this. -My eyes hurt.
a trap again, see, the boarder's moral.
let him take a seat there.
I can see nothing.
be calm, let me take a look.
not so good.
you, go out and ring the bell, call all the people. -Shouldn't we call a doctor first?
you know the principle for guests? What did I tell you, ring the bell, call the people.
where is the bell?
open the door, you'll see it.
Gather!
Gather!
does this kind of incident often happen?
ring, just ring the bell.
everybody heads to the yard. Gather!
quickly, keep quiet.
bald! - Quiet!
bald bullet! -Quiet!
keep quiet.
I said nothing! -Quiet!
the reason I called you, is that uncle Maxence just became a victim of a complot.
according to our "action-reaction" principle, the peace breaker will be hell to pay.
so, if we can't find the peace breaker in 3 minute,
everybody will take 6 hours confine, in turn.
until the rat turns himself in or is reported by others. Is that clear?
one two three
nobody there? Obviously.
come here.
it's you, Mathieu
me?
come here.
Mr. Chabert, give me the leaflet, thank you
Mr. Mathieu is the new Warden. He didn't have time to know you.
Bold-head!
be quiet.
it is him to decide who will be the first one to be punished.
be quiet!
pick a name.
pick at ease?
if you allow me to give a little suggestion...
let him in. Come.
Boniface
it's unlucky. Chabert, bring Boniface out.
but, I did nothing.
shut up!
I am not leaving. I did nothing. Can't you shut your mouth up. Go!
I am not leaving. I am not leaving
quiet!
in addition, if the peacebreaker is not found, all the recreation activities will be cancelled.
and any outer visit is forbidden.
thus, I demand you to reveal him as soon as possible.
that only make them slander each other.
like every new-comer, you are full of compassion. But after few days, let us wait and see.
Mr. Haron will switch jobs with you. You take his position.
clean sheet.
Thanks.
why will you leave.
a unhealed wound.
by scissors
all because I confiscate Mondain (means sheep in English) 's cigarette.
sheep?
a kid. His name is Mondain.
is he still here, this Mondain?
as I know, it's Le Querrec who did something in the door of uncle Maxence
I just overhear it in the corridor.
but why do you keep silence?
that would be complicated. I don't want to miss the bus.
uncle Maxence must be punished for revealing his tricks.
it's a revenge. Just his style.
le Querrec, you have remember this name, Le Querrec
and "Morhange," yes, "Morhange
he speaks little, but you have to keep an eye on him.
angel face, devil body
action and reaction, it's the rule known to everyone.
I'm leaving. Good luck!
thank you.
our benefactor.
that is the class schedule.
in the schedule, the principal teaches history and language.
and other courses, it seems Mr. Langlois is the only teacher.
Mr. Langlois, let me introduce our new Warden.
my name is Clement Mathieu
a Warden at your age?
Yes, I was once a teacher.
that is perfect.
he never jokes.
there is the classroom, you should go there. It's already late.
you needn't me to show you the road.
gentlemen.
smoking is forbidden in the class, everyone, even you, sir.
give it back to me, quiet!
give it back to me.
is it all right?
Congratulations. Mathieu
be seated.
it's nature. You, always you.
what did he do?
nothing. Mr. principal
how could it be nothing.
didn't you want to punish him just now?
Oh, no. I just write questions in the blackboard. I was asking them to keep quiet when you were in.
actually, you should keep them quiet. No exceptions.
go to the corner.
all right. Now, it seems you know me much more. We have something to do.
just now, one of your mates is in the guardhouse.
but he did nothing.
and I, it seems I know nothing. But in fact it is not true.
I know who did it.
I give him 15 seconds to confess.
I am waiting.
unfortunately. 5 seconds left.
too late.
le Querrec, who is Le Querrec
me , sir
look
so, it is you who wounded uncle Maxence.
no. not me.
I am not asking you. I am confirming.
I did nothing.
keep this word to the principal.
while I am not here, I hope some serious sir will keep the order for me.
if my first impression is not wrong, This serious sir is
Mr. Morhange
be quiet, who is Morhange?
it's me, sir.
so, the angel face refers to you
go to the blackboard. Keep order of the class while I am not here.
quick!
it's nice. Dressed up quite good.
shirt is revealed outside. It's fashion.
since people said cool boy has the ability of leadership, You should behave quite well.
let us go to the principal.
mercy on me, sir.
mercy?
did you show mercy on the classmate who is in custody instead of you?
did you show mercy on uncle Maxence?
I didn't want to harm him. I just played a joke.
a joke?
it's enough. Do you hear, I have to give you a good lesson in my office.
who is that?
it's Leclerc, he was separated for the third time.
he just pulled from guardhouse.
it's ok. You will not be beaten. Let's go.
no.
listen. Maybe we can deal this privately.
you wounded uncle Maxence badly. Really bad.
I could do not handle you to the principal. But I still have to give a lesson to you.
since today, we have no recreation activities. You have to give a hand to the infirmary
you will be in charge for looking after uncle Maxence, until he get recovered.
do you agree?
not bad, ah?
I believe I can draw better, give me a profile pose.
profile?
smile, change your appearance.
come on. Turn your head.
Ah, I forget.
little red spot.
does it look better? Go back to you seat.
all right, in order to know you better,
I ask you to write down your name, age and what you want to do in the future in a small sheet of paper
out of my expectation,
all the students wrote seriously.
everybody, expect one.
don't you write?
how long have you been here?
a long time?
I don't know.
come on, write, young man
a fatigued first day.
I don't know why I am here.
Hason scared me. This somber architecture makes me afraid.
even these kids scare me.
I feel, some of them would run into my room and murder me anytime.
my sheet.
give me a kiss. Shut up. Go to sleep.
I read what the students wrote.
everyone's dream is so perfect.
two firemen, three cowboys, one tiger-tamer.
four bravos, two spies, one Napoleon's general.
one balloon-river, three soldiers. None of them want to be a school-Warden.
you are so kind to come here helping me.
look, doctor, the new Warden let the student help me.
and he has right to not come here. But he comes at his own will.
so we should believe. Some time miracle do happen.
please come in.
this is Mr. Mathieu, our new Warden.
how are you How are you
how
uncle Maxence, the place you stay is too harsh. If I were you, I would be desperate.
because you are patience to them.
you are hard.
but I would not complain. Those who should complain would be the kids.
even a child died here.
dead?
he is an orphan.
everyone said he is incurable. But actually he is not.
a little persatic, need understanding.
uncle Maxence is kind, isn't he?
le Querrec, I am asking you.
uncle Maxence is kind, isn't he?
Yes.
I can't hear you.
don't make fun of him. He is shy, just like me.
Really?
I need to talk to you. Mr. principal.
Ah, you will leave us so soon? No, I just want to do an experiment.
about uncle Maxence's incident.
that is not incident.
sure. But, I want you to permit these three things.
what?
first, cancel the ban of recreation activities.
second, allow me to punish the peacebreaker.
third, please allow me not tell his name.
if you could catch him.
of course, only if I can catch him.
you are arrogant, dude.
so, you believe you could find him like this.
good, very good. If you permit, I will cancel the ban of recreation activities.
and the peacebreaker never found. It makes me a big fool.
I know who did it, sir.
Oh, good. Who is it?
that means you have to allow me not to tell the name.
good, very good.
but you have to watch the students very carefully.
especially, do not complain to me about your class.
my feeling is, things are under control.
ha. You sing well, dude.
these are not erotic pictures.
I never said those are erotic pictures.
what is in it?
pray of holy mother, tenor, written by Clement Mathieu
here is quintet chord, written by Clement Mathieu

would it be better to tell him the truth directly?
we repeated for hundred of times, your parents are dead. But it doesn't work.
now, we have to let him wait at the door, which would make him feel better.
be quiet.
do you see, action and reaction.
what do you mean?
action? Reaction?

Why?

Really? A little.
so why do you ask me for permission, since you already made decision.
I don't like your way, understand?

feb. 8, when I prepare for the first rehearsal. Hason was fury on Morhange
after the custody, he was punished for a month of public service in the school.

feb. 15
a visit from Dr. Dervaux. He is a psychologist
he brought us a little present.
we decided to bring this boy from Sofia borstal.
to study his adaptability in a free circumstance.
but unlike most of his classmates, Mondain knows to read and write.
in all, he knows how to speak.
just like ordinary person.
we test him in Pill Simon's quiz
pill Simon's quiz
Yes, he passed Hoja's test as well.
good.
the test, as you know, Divide children's intelligent into 7 degrees.
normal, adequate, less, Slightly amentia, medium amentia, severe amentia
the last degree, anoia
Mondain is in the less degree.
in a way, his situation is not so bad. But I have to remind you.
he has a little bit "Stangaxia" evil tendency.
bad enough.
to be accurate, what does it mean?
doctor?
prone to be violent, parasite and destroy. Especially,
lying Exactly.
so many bad things. But here,
here are the kids to accept normal education.
we will observe how Monda immerge into the community.
piece of cake.
let's try our best to cooperate with your science experiment
gentlemen, you are in charge of settling him down.
will you come for lunch? I'm very glad.
as for him, you have to keep an eye all the time.
action and reaction.
no smoking here.
to finish the experiment smoothly, I have to make an authority of my own.
you really have a bad mouth.
you must obey the order, or else let's wait and see.
OK.
let me see.
can you sing?
Yes, but
but for what?
you will not like.
we have to try. Come on.
come on
I am listening.
I show my penis in front of Claire
I hardly wait to fuck her
stop Last time I slept with you was long time ago.
enough.
I told you.
not bad, need practice. But you have quite good voice for a baritone.
voice for what?
baritone, it is not an insult. Just describe someone's voice is more thick while singing.
go to the back, with those basses.
bitch.
let your bitch rest.
next time who dares to laugh, I promise to give him a good lesson.
as you wish, Mondain
his punishment is over
I brought Pepinot back. I forgot him in the doorway.
Pepinot, it is not Saturday today.
by the way, in the letters to your parents
I don't have parents.
of course, to those who have parents
remind them, to visit you on the first or third Thursday every month.
Morhange, you distracted so soon. What did I say?
Oh, I don't know.
I just said, you can write to your mother
to visit you on the first or third Thursday every month.
or both these two days, all right?
but, those under punishment can't accept visitors. My old man, I do not want to see him.
but Morhange maybe want to see his mother.
he is not alone.
all right, Morhange, come to the chorus.
none of my business.
what business?
how is your voice. Show us.
do..." Come on.
do you want to return to guardhouse? Come on, quick.
your voice can't be good, child.
not everyone has good voice.
come again.
where are you going?
I'm enough, I am going to the toilet. Mondain, wait.
come, Corbin Me too, I am going to the toilet, sir.
all right, everybody goes out.
quiet, quiet
once there was a small man named Geyekarabi
he ran away while hunting, and the hunter farm was inBetikarabi
Karabi, Dodokarabo companion of Greye
will let you, will let you, will let you die.
sings well, beauty.
do you want?
why are you alone? I will protect you.
wait for me. We are alike.
I, my parents are fucks.
so are your mother and you
she put you here and be happy herself outside
no, she has to work -Ah, it seems that what they said is real -What?
she is a bitch
get in!
you game over!
Oh, do I?
Morhange absented himself from call-over at 3pm that day
no one knows where did he return from but afterall he is back
that's important
why are you here?
I'm not authorized to go upstairs
what do you mean? Nor authorized?
Why?
because I have no money
you have no money, so you can't sleep? What the hell happened?
it's Mondain. If I don't give him money, he won't let me sleep
we must be careful
I was always paid attention to by warden when I was in former school
and I let him pay for it
how do you do it?
I gave him a stab with his blood bursting -Did you kill him? -Maybe, yes
the same situation here, don't let the calvities bluster us
Mathieu is not a bad guy
are you kidding? He asts well in front of you
then will act bad behind you, can't you bear it?
good evening, gentlemen -Have a good appetite! -I swear I didn't do anything, sir!
you like to make friends, Corbin
get out!
I will keep it secret that you eat here
as a gift for you
but I warn you,
don't speak to Pepinot, don't approach him
don't even look at him, is that clear?
even if it is one look, I will turn your life into nightmare -What are you doing here, Morhange? -Nothing, sir
I just hear the singing, maybe it's illusion from tire
the 8th school rule states: prohibit student to go to the classroom alone
if it were Mr. Hason, he will punish you by copying out the assignment for 100 times
maybe don't let you see your mother
I don't care my mother -What did you do, answer me! -I have nothing to tell you
wait! I'm not finishing my talking, you can't go like this
everything needs money for Pepinot
the problem is: Morhange, You are doing something not worthy
disobey the rules, fight and with gangsters
maybe it will let others disappointed, but I won't,
your little tricks will finish, You must join chorus from tomorrow,
and you must attend music class everyday
go, go to sleep
go
2018/3/3
maybe he doesn't notice, but I'm sure
his voice is a miracle
it is an unusual tone
you can go now, keep quiet
keep quiet!
gradually, with the progress of my chorus
I gave more lessons to new student

I didn't tell your mother you were punished, I cheated her that you went to fill a tooth, don't let it out -You sing well, don't you? -Yes
the gentleman seems happy for you, is he kind to you?
not bad
I bring you clean underwares, and I bring you chocolate
are you happy?
april, the children let me full of inspiration Wind on the sea
I'm sure that my bright future of music is coming
I'm Clement Mathieu, a musician, compose for them, every night
fly from snowy earth
here comes the trend of winter is going
your echo goes far away
hispanic castle
turn in the gyral wind, spread your wings
in the gray morning, find the road to rainbow, Uncover the prelude of spring
wind on the sea,
holds the lightsome aigret
stop on the rock in the isolated island
here comes the trend of winter is going
your breath goes far away
deep into the mountains
turn in the gyral wind, spread your wings
in the gray morning, find the road to rainbow, Uncover the prelude of spring
the sea is still quiet
isn't it good? Sir?
Yes, very good, you sing well
be quiet!
you bastard! Go!
what did he do?
he wants to steal my watch, in my room, I'm so surprised
needn't ask Hason for advice, "Action-Reaction
where do you bring him? -Guardhouse! Keep him inside for 15 days!
wait! -Wait for what?
he is my only barytone
Mathieu!
what's the matter, sir? -I see the drawings again...
sorry, principal, just a ball
stand aside!
Mathieu, Chabert,
follow me
may, as the weeks pass, I get more and more success
dawn of summer
pulsatile dreams
my heart rises, fly away from earth
tears in eyes have gone,
Leclerc, we are good friends, ain't we? I indulge in it
of course, why do you ask this? Everything is flaring -5 multiply 7 is? -53
are you sure? -Of course
Thanks!
sail is in the wind, bank is far away
it's time of summer,
sing free songs,
black clouds are blotted out
the first month of summer,
shimmy happily
everything is jumping...
maybe it's only an illusion, but
it seems that our principal are conquered by the changes
honour, disgrace and fear are all away
from children's puzzle
no grief at all
dawn of summer
pulsatile dreams
my heart rises fly away from earth
tears in eyes have gone,
I indulge in it,
everything is flaring
sail in the wind, bank is far away
it's time of summer,
sing free songs,
black clouds are blotted out
dawn of summer
pulsatile dreams...
look, Uncle Maxence
attention, don't move
smile
come on, come out, Mondain!
it's finished, child
come on!
Chabert, I just met Mr. principal,
to tell him that Mathieu's chorus is so great -I'm tired -But you are always so tired, walk then!
29, what did you say just now?
get out of here, that's it
where is Mondain?
don't you notice his loss during the running?
he was there in the morning, Mr. principal
after that, he...
good, in case of it, I will prohibit all the outside campus activities this year -Did he take much money? -All the money, around 100 thousands francs
now with which should I pay fuel supplier? What to do?
I shouldn't have accepted him
it's just for a test, the damn test!
just like you, your music
we have to wait for the coal till next week Before that, we have to inform police
when he lay in the casket...
what's the matter?
with his victory, he wants to open the casket
five, five, five thousand francs, Mr. Hason...
I observed that "music kings" are very smart, Mathieu
they make great progress
Mr. s principal, children haven't bathed with warm water for three weeks
cool water can improve blood cycle, get out
by the way, Mathieu
stop your chorus -But, Mr. principal -Thanks, Mr. Mathieu
police station, please
I don't know how to do with the chorus
but we can use firewood for children's bath
we have no firewood at all!
but Mr. principal has his personal storage
Chabert,"Action"-"Reaction
Chabert surprises me
I thought he is Hason's accomplice
but actually he is brave, and he thinks sports and music are the key elements for the comity of country
with his help, I organize a "team of counteract
my chorus becomes a "underground party
no, you always letup at the send half of the sentence
I say one more last time: ensure every syllable is correct
it's late today, we exercise tomorrow
why not exercise the second part, sir?
I didn't teach you the solo part
but I've learnt
how come?
OK, let's begin
come on, come out
may 13th, 3pm, Mondain is back -Where is the money? -I don't know -Who stole it? -I don't know, not me
how is it?
he is beat him?
for half an hour
is he mad?
he is wasting time, the child won't say anything at all
OK, let's start from the beginning
where is the money?
say!
where is the money?
let him go!
let him go!
calm down!
calm down!
the child has admitted, good I will report to police station
you will see another house, children, another guards and locks
to prevent the children from the hurt, We don't tell the truth of the Mondain matter "We send him back to original school" and it's over.
a hen
lays 84 eggs every year
if we improve the conditions of feeding, habitation
ventilation and sanitation,
it will lay 150 eggs
then how many more eggs it will lay because of the improvement?
a farmer has 9 hens...
is it fine?
sunshine always makes people happy
let us have a nice day
as you know, Pierre surprises me everyday
anyway, I.
I thank you very much for what have you done foe him
I do it for you as well
Oh, I mean, if Pierre is in good condition, your situation is better then...
let me wipe it -It's ok, it's ok -Just ink, nevermind -You are too much! Idiot!
what's the matter? Oh!
why do you beat him?
tell me, little Pepi
hmmm, because he threw ink to you
can you shut up your mouth?
I feel shame on you.
wait! It's ok!
you have to understand, It's because he is proud of you and you are pretty
pretty?
I mean, you are unusual comparing with other children's mother
do you mean that I'm alone?
but I am -But you have no child -No
um, I have sixty
but when they see you, they seems to met the lady in their dream
I mean, they hope you are their mother visiting them
it's not a dream for Pierre, you are his mother
like all other children, he doesn't want to share with others
I must send him out of the school, so that he could go to conservatory
I'm afraid music is not a career
engaging in music is a true career
if he grasp enough knowledge, he could go to Lyons Institute of Music,
I'm trying not to let him have a bad habit
but, even talent may meet a bad teacher -But then? -Then, he will succeed
one wood is not a tree,
pierre is gifted, I will try not to let it disappear - But it need your help, too - I see, thanks
Oh, night, befalls
your supernatural secret quiet magic
no, no! What's the matter, today? Are you all sleepy?
and you, Boniface, how do you stand?
do you think we can sing like this? Stand straight!
OK, again, start from "So gentle...
so gentle, it's your music words for hopes
so grand, it's your supernatural
turn everything into nice dream
Oh, night, still
where is my solo?
what solo?
my solo!
Ah, yes, your solo, no, no sole any more
you have a good voice, but we can deal with it without you
you sing or not. I'm not concerned with it
it's no problem at all without your solo
listen, we start...
we start from "Oh, night
Oh, night, befalls
your supernatural secret quiet magic
Mathieu!
sir, Mr. Hason wants to talk to you? -Did he say?
Oh, dismiss
you bring me so many trouble, do you know?
Mr. principal, I promise to you, the courses are finished
charity committee knows your chorus
it's the letter from countess
her friends and she will come next Sunday She wants to listen
it's great!
um, it's good
what can they see here? Children, music, why not little cheese?
the silly thing you did makes me embarrassing
but, Mr. principal, you will know
music doesn't interfere the execution of rules
the problems are less and less for a long time
that's coincidence
I won't do something coincident, Mr. principal
that's my understanding, who ask you to tell committee about the chorus?
it's me
do you know how to write?
uncle Maxence obviously knows -I don't need your explanation
I don't like your ways, Mathieu
I think you care nothing, Mr. principal
Mr. Hason, someone is waiting for you at the guest room!
let's talk about these later
it's for you
if he say such silly words next time, let me pinch his throat
Violette thanks what have I done for his son
she wants to talk with me personally
she has something important to tell me
the date is at Square coffee bar, 20th, 4pm
I wrote a letter to Lyons Institute of Music
I know the principal there
he answered me politely
he will be glad if he accept him, and what you should do is to
let him get a stipend -I think things are simple from now on -Is it?
after I met you,
my...my life...
how to say?
change totally? -Exactly!
it's all because of you
I can't imagine...
so do I, I can't imagine...
I'm thinking, maybe I'm mistake, it's too fast
Ah, no, trust me, no problem
actually, you bring me luck
luck?
I meet a guy,
he is an engineer from Lyons
I met him in the coffee bar
he works here in a bridge project
are you ok?
fine
it's a good chance, either for you or for Pierre
don't see me off, I've to go
I'm very glad we three will live together
will you tell Pierre about it? Will you?
why not
OK, goodbye
goodbye
thanks for all you've done
Oh, I forget, don't tell this to Pierre now
sorry, may I take the chair?
of course -Thanks
countess, I'm very glad to ...
although I'm not clear, but I understand you
thank you, good child
countess, please allow me to introduce you Mr. Mathieu,
our warden, who teach the children chorus
countess
please accept my praise, sir,
we care the way of teaching very much And Mr. Hason's understanding and support
and we also thank you to the contribute to this way of teaching
by the way, who comes the idea of chorus? It's...
that's to say... -Mine, Countess, my idea
actually, madam, I'm very glad, to get the support from such a kind superior
let them begin to sing -Mr. Hason is modest, he doesn't like other's praise -That's right
what will you sing, then?
hamer's "Night," Countess
great, that must be beautiful
excuse me, who is the boy standing there?
is he being punished?
that boy? He is an exception
may I begin?
Oh, night
befalls
your supernatural secret quiet magic
the shadow clustering round is so sweet!
so gentle, it's your music words for hopes
so grand, it's your supernatural
turn everything into nice dream!
Oh, night
still covers the land.
your supernatural secret quiet magic.
the shadow clustering round is so sweet!
isn't it more beautiful than a dream?
isn't it more deserved to hope than expected?
tally with my time perfectly, in Morhange's eye,
I read many things suddenly
proud, happy after forgiveness
and what's more, for the first time for him he knows the appreciation
one day in summer
our chorus welcomes a new member
kite dancing in the wind
please don't stop...
sorry, I miss the repeated part
it's all my fault, continue
kite dancing in the wind,
please don't stop
flying to sea, flying to sky
a boy is looking at you
cozy trips, rotary convolution
naive love
flies along your contrail, your contrail
I can feel children's thirsty for freedom Kite dancing in the wind
build a cubbyhouse in the remotest places Please don't stop
the good weather makes them heartrending Flying to sea, flying to sky
a boy is looking at you
in the storm
you uplift your wings
don't gorget to return to me
come here, it's important
I just cleaned the blanket of toilet
I lifted a brick and found this -It's Corbin's harmonica -And this one
at least 100 thousands franc inside
no one knows your secret storage place
don't tell me, the money fly here accidently
do you know Mondain was sent to jail because people accuse him of theft
I don't know
actually, you don't know
now I've told you
what's the matter with you? What do you want to do with the money?
if I tell you, will you tell others?
no
I swear
I want to save money to buy...
buy what?
a fire balloon
we don't know who steals it, but it proves that Mondain is innocent
he never take the money out of here! Apparently
they will send him to Dimodu the day after tomorrow
Mathieu, don't be confused
even if Mondain didn't do that at all, he will do it sooner or later
such a kind of person, is incorrigible, incorrigible -But at least there is justice? -Yes, he is getting the punishment he deserves
Mr. principal, wait for me!
wait for me! -Will you go, too?
I just hitchhike I spend my vacation in my relative
my sister's. There is a piano there
do you know why does Mr. Hason go to Lyons?
I think he wants to shoot for fee from the committee -Doesn't he? -Yes
but actually, his main purpose is to shoot for chance of promotion and his badge
do you think he will succeed?
ha, face to committee? He wrote a new report
hide the terrible things you know, And claimed that the chorus is successful -Successful? -Yes, I've heard about it, good reply
sir, Mr. Langlois and principal are all left, is it real?
Yes, and Chabert is on vacation for two weeks, We are free
then there is no course today?
no -What shall we do? -Take a nap
no, I have a better idea
excuse me, you...
your budget? -Yes
practically certain, Mr. Hason
I don't know how could I thank you
Mr. principal, your telephone please...
excuse me, I...
fire flees from eaves
and blazes swallow the lodging house, And children last seen were inside
sixty children lose, surrounded like a small mouse
to Hason
it's his chance of promotion and his badge burnt in front of him
but suddenly...
we go out from the back door of small kaiyard after lunch
not letting Mrs. Mary and others see us, then
we go to the Linong forest
why do you go there?
play hoodman-blind, children are happy
I have to say, uncle Maxence, I'm disappointed by your absent without leave
Mr. principal, I should be totally responsible for this
uncle Maxence tried to persuade me for many times
what you said is not convincing
in another aspect, that is to say, we save the children
Yes, but there won't be fire unless you keep the school unguarded!
I really don't understand why I listen to your explanation
OK, uncle Maxence, considering your long term contribution to the school
you will be deducted one month's salary
as for you, Mr. Mathieu, you are fired
because you act against school's rules
if it is, fire me, too!
but it's not decided by you here!
Mr. Maxence, thanks for your kindness But I believe children need you very much
think about children, since the gentleman never take care of them
this is your remaining salary, here you are
you must leave now by taking the bus at 6
I prohibit you to see children again -How could it be?
uncle Maxence, watch him, go
Mr. principal, before I go, please let me tell you what I think of you
I know, Mathieu -You are not employable, you are too cruelhearted -What about them -They didn't choose to come here -Neither do I
I never think of being a reeducation professional
you don't tell me, you assume you come here to bury your dream of being famous
you have your dream, so do I -But don't put your anger on the children -If you think I like to do that, I will let you stay
somebody nust do it, come on
take your baton, go to Paris
go to find prime minister, "pang, pang, pang
Hello! I'm Mathieu, we must use true educator not guys go in half way
devote it, because you have belief, Mathieu! How is it, Mathieu!
just a unsuccessful musician, a warden
just a small warden,
I engaged music, too, Mathieu, now warden, too! Dead warden, warden, warden, warden, warden!
you are a madman
I'm so tired, get out of here
on the contrary, I'm leaving it
I hope children see me off at the gate, but nobody there
these children's caution seems more like apathy
and Morhange, at last...
kite dancing in the wind, Please don't stop
kite dancing in the wind,
please don't stop
flying to sea, flying to sky
a boy is looking at you
cozy trips, rorty convolution
on the first piece of paper, I see Boniface exquisite handwriting
and the one with wrong spelling, should be Pepinot's
and those with score, have Morhange's signature
and this one, that one
a boy is looking at you
in the storm
you uplift your wings
don't gorget to return to me "Kite dancing in the wind, Please don't stop
kite dancing in the wind
please don't stop -Be Quiet!
flying to sea, flying to sky -They lock the door
a boy is looking at you
at that time, all my skin are full of happiness and optimism
I want to whoop to all over the world
but who could hear that?
no one knows who I am
great artist sees the true self in front of the mirror
I'm Clement Mathieu, an unsuccessful musician, an unsuccessful warden
I'm Clement Mathieu, an unsuccessful musician, an unsuccessful warden
then?
he never wrote diary
but I, I can tell you
and Pepinot told me. The next day, on my road back to school
my childhood memories burst
after Mathieu was fired, my mother take me home
we went to Lyons, I entered Institute of Music there
engineer wanted to let me continue to lodge, My mother refused
and he left us
Chabert, Langlois and uncle Maxence united
and uncover Hason's ill-treat to student
children were enquired, Hason was fired
clement Mathieu continued to teach others music untill he past away
he never tried to be famous
what he had done, has become his own secret
only his secret? No, not merely
Mr. Mathieu!
wait for me
Mr. Mathieu!
why are you here?
could you please take me with you?
Oh, I can't do that
you must go back to school, otherwise you will be punished -Please -Shall we go?
be right back
I'm not authorized, I can't take you away
go back
go
go
Pepinot's clinging wait deserves it
the day when Mathieu was fired is Saturday

I haven't even had time to celebrate...
and you want me to do this?
we received a citizen's complaint

it's the illegal workers who clean the sewers
a Japanese would never do such a dirty job
if his toilet was blocked
shit would just pile up to his ass
OK, all right
after this, I'll buy you some drinks Lead the way
the number of illegals has gone up in the past 2 months
the brass needs to clean things up

some customers order in advance too
the harder it is to steal, the higher the price
come, freshly grilled
have it while it's hot. So slow!
I'll tell you who they are
the crew cut is from Vietnam
the effeminate one behind you is from Shanghai
those on the other side... the loud ones ...are from Fujian
the people here...
...are capable of doing anything
do they work with each other?
they're all in different gangs, so probably not
don't listen to him

you spend nothing, but you have cigarettes

I'll wait outside

let me go...
what are you doing?
you... what are you doing?
help! Help!
help! Help! Run!
help...
thank you... thank you
are you OK?
Oh, it's you
I hit the jackpot today
Mito-san
sister
Mito-san, your head is bleeding! Come and help
I'm pissed off
no, don't drink any more
give me a drink! Sit down first...
I can't calm down without booze
wang, bring the first aid box right away
come... sit
here's the box
I don't know how to thank you
money's the most practical, please take it
I still need to return this money to you
thanks
I'm looking to hire someone
why not come and help me?
it's OK, I have work
let me get you a drink
wang, bring some food
what would you like? I'll go prepare it
anything will do.- OK
no need to be curious
they're all working students
I purposely opened this bar at a quiet location
I wanted to keep things simple
Kabuki-cho is too uncivilised
Zunaku is a hostess bar
it's yours?
Yes!
if you're lonely or troubled
just come here for a drink
this place is meant to sooth sorrows
I envy her
I too would like a man to search the world for me
you don't have a man?
no good man!
good men like good women
wrong! Good men like bad women
so you're a bad woman looking for a good man
right! You're so right!
Ah, problems, everyone has their problems
are you doing OK at work?
I'm doing OK
that's good. Don't rush yourself
when people are in a hurry, they stray from the path
what do you want?
you're obstructing justice, you're under arrest
reject the Anti-yakuza bill, protect our rights
can you please elaborate on...
how the Japanese mafia can co-exist with other legal organizations?
they don't exactly co-exist
it is a long and complicated story
can you give us a simplified explanation?
it's rather difficult...
tell the branches to burn all papers
and cease operations Yes
no one is to use any violence
don't give the cops any excuse to hold us
understood
move out! Yes!
hurry up! There's no time!
Hurry!
sir, times have changed
Sanwa-kai cannot survive on old rules
we need radical changes
Togawa Taro from Togawa-gumi...
will never accept your suggestion
perhaps, but Togawa-gumi is pushing things
the cops will use this as an excuse to arrest us
we can't treat him as the enemy
we can't have Sanwa-kai in disarray
and we certainly cannot anger Togawa Taro
I understand
welcome
good evening, Eguchi-san
please come in
here you go
who is that man?
big shots!
look, look
the one in red...
is Gao, the Taiwan gang's leader
the fiercest in Shinjuku
I think the tall guy beside him is probably a mobster
jie, is that her?
surely not
isn't it?
Hey, what are you doing?
don't go
nakajima, take the things in
I can take them
no need
nakajima, do you need to move some stuff?
thank you
if it's not enough, there's more inside
thank you
that man just now
seemed quite taken with you
he is from my village
under the circumstances, I didn't dare greet him
I didn't want to embarrass you
Yuko
we've been together so long
why would I discriminate against the Chinese?
some people discriminate against foreigners
I think that's too extreme, and naive
don't you agree, Nakajima?
many Chinese have come to Kabuki-cho
they're creating a mess there
actually, they are no different from us
just trying to make a living
do you know how many Chinese...
helped to build Kabuki-cho after the war?
never mind
Yuko
if you meet your friends again
just make contact with them
I won't mind
I've been keeping this for a special occasion
tonight, it's bottoms up!
come!
Ah... Enough, enough...
what's up?
waiting is such torture
now we have the answer, great!
come, let's paint the town!
good, paint the town!
stop! What are you doing?
don't run!
come down!
run!
my papers! My papers!
squat down!
I can't go back
since I'm on the road of no return
I should make life better for myself
I'll make some money and make myself legal
I can't live in the shadows forever
you mean...
you want to skirt the law?
what do you think?
my problem is I'm a coward
I just want a pushcart to sell Tianjin chestnuts
that's my biggest ambition
every dream needs money
excuse me, brother Tai Bo
my buddy Steelhead has a deal for you
let's sit and chat
what's to talk?
20 cards? 50?
2, 000 now, 1 0, 000 next month
can you move that much?
I have people
good! Just show me the money!
remember, it's 1, 000 for 8 cards
if they bargain, just throw in a couple free
phone cards... phone cards...
1, 000 yen for 10
phone cards... phone cards...
1, 000 yen for 10
if you want to make more, sell fake cards!
to pose as tourists, you must behave like them
what do you think? Beautiful?
remember, look for the expensive stuff!
hong Kong Boy, come over
this is good
look at this, this one... it's good
PACHlNKO
I've secretly rigged this machine
I'll teach you a special way to play it
it will spit out tens of thousands of yen every day
it's steady income
we've to get 600, 000 yen to go into business
is it risky?
isn't being an illegal worker risky?
let's go for it, here's 30, 000
I'm in!
here's my 30, 000
jie, go and change the presents. - OK
sorry... there's no problem
let me do it
calm down, why are you so flustered?
thanks
have you seen this kind of card before?
I think so
sir, are you not well?
I'm fine... I'm fine...
are you sure? Yes, I'm fine
please wait. - Thank you
you can take a seat over there
it's fine... really
why are you so nervous?
he's really unwell... Iet it go
all right?
Jie... Jie...
come here
what's going on?
there's a delivery for you, go take a look
for me? What is it?
OK... quiet down
jie, we all discussed it
you're too timid for a life of crime
we pooled our money and got you a cart
you can sell your chestnuts
work hard Go have a look
tasty chestnuts, sweet and fragrant!
sweet and fragrant!
30 percent is Fate, the rest is a battle
you can only win if you love a good fight
check it. - OK
is this what you wanted? - Yes
OK, I'll keep this one
looks great
such a coincidence... shopping?
my day off today, just looking around
I've been doing this recently
this is for you
for real?
of course, it's for real. It's from Takashimaya
I mean are you really giving it to me?
Oh... boss, give me a bag
Thanks!
don't put it here, over there!
do you have it? Two twos, any takers?
no Three fours
quiet... quiet...
Steelhead's brought a woman back
no way!
and she's quite pretty
they're coming
it's very lively in here
let me help you
thank you
what? Seen a ghost?
Yes, two in fact
a male and a female
you!
can't ever say anything nice!
let me introduce
she's Lily, a special friend of mine
how are you? Sister in law!
that's Auntie Hao. How do you do?
pleased to meet you
miss Lily
you and Steelhead look like a couple!
auntie Hao, what are you saying...
attention! Marry now, bridal chamber next!
the banquet comes tomorrow. Hear, hear!
you people are impossible
making noise all day long
you've destroyed my perfectly good place
get out, all of you, or I'll call the cops!
get out!
what did he say?
what did he say?
he... he said you're rude and noisy
he wants you to go, or he'll call the cops
move? Are you kidding...
lao Gwei It's new year and he wants me to move!
hush...
I'm sorry
please...
what's this?
please
this won't work next time
remember, sort the garbage!
this is a broken shack, what's he so pissed off for?
don't you agree?
what did he say?
you must have got him in trouble...
...By not sorting the garbage
this place is a garbage dump! What do we need to sort?
that's right! Hey!
you can't blame him for being mad, it's his property
if we piss him off, he'll go to the cops
who suffers? We do
Hey, we have to learn Japanese...
if we want to blend into their world
we're living in their home, we should build links
we need to communicate more
you're right
why don't I start a Japanese class and teach you all for free?
fantastic, count me in. - OK!
me too... I want to as well...
OK, no more talk
it's new year, time to eat!
Yes, new year! Let's eat!
lao Gwei, speak softer
you're the loudest, tidy up!
why so late tonight?
business has been good
Really? Look
let me show you some magic. - OK
which hand?
this one
nothing
that... that one
also nothing
where is it? Where is it?
I think, it's in your ear...
how can it be? Let me see
it's really there
Really? - How would I know?
I'll give it to you. - OK
who are you?
he's my father
how do you do?
I'm also Chinese! It's the New Year
a gift from me
you're also Chinese?
come, have a cup of tea!
come... Sure...
how about my cart? No worries!
go on home
Why?
just go
I told you to go home! - Why?
I said go! Go home!
dad...
who do you think you are?
you dare touch my daughter?
I didn't, we're just friends
friends?
weren't you just holding her hand?
don't misunderstand. - Misunderstand?!
we're just platonic friends
teach him a lesson!
no, please listen to me
I really have no designs on her
beat him!
don't...
jie
dad, stop it!
stop hitting him!
is Jie back?
no. Come... eat while it's hot
give me the cold one, have the hot one...
auntie, leave some for Jie
of course... of course
Oh... mother!
what's wrong? Who?
he's bleeding
it's Jie! Jie!
what happened?
come... sit here...
what happened?
who beat you?
uncle Tak...
who is this Uncle Tak?
an old China hand
he has yakuza support
we always try to avoid him and try to ignore him
I told you to leave his daughter alone
why didn't you listen?
where are your ears? Can you hear?
he's taken my cart
let's go
get the cart back!
Steelhead, don't mess with these people
he really has yakuza support
if we don't look after our brothers
does that mean I should also look away...
if any of you are in trouble in future?
those without balls can stay and eat!
I'll be back
what do we do now?
Steelhead...Steelhead
which one?
the one at the back
what are you up to?
you don't understand? Are you a foreigner?
you looking for trouble?
shouldn't be
chinese are forbidden
you asshole
you want to die?
what's going on?
what's with the noise?
this guy
are you Uncle Tak?
who wants to know?
give me back the chestnut cart
and you injured my friend, I want you to apologise!
what? Say that again!
apologise! Return the cart!
beat him!
hong Kong Boy!
apologise! Return the cart!
apologise! Return the cart!...
quickly! No way...
where is he? There!
don't hit me... don't hit me...
Where's the cart?
the back alley...
the cops are here
cops!
stop... don't run!
here
it's stuck. Move that
let's go!
the police!
don't run, I'm not arresting you
don't run!
you saved my life
I wanted to thank you
I'm Kitano, I've been looking for you...
...to thank you
my cellphone number
call me if you need help
Kitano-san
go!
not here, that way
it's been tampered with
damn it!
put it back
delicious chestnuts!
thanks
jie Thank you for coming
jie
can you look after the pachinko for me?
I need to take a piss OK
I really need to go... Hurry. - Let me turn out the fire
it's that machine. - I know
hurry. -OK
you bastard, you've got balls! You've got guts!
you dare tamper with my machine?
I don't understand...
I said you've got balls!
messing with my shop!
I didn't... you got it wrong...
I sell chestnuts
you look familiar, you come often?
I already told you I sell chestnuts
I think you're here to make trouble
I'm not!
you have a death wish
do you have partners? Quickly!
take him away!
I really don't know
look, that's my cart
you really sell chestnuts?
Yes, I sell chestnuts. - Then there's nothing to fear
keep a look out
take him inside
don't run...
don't be afraid!
why are you crying?
why try to run?
I really didn't...
bring him inside...
who's your leader?
Oh, he shit his pants?
then answer quickly!
who's your leader?
how many of you are there?
where do you live? Tell me and I'll let you go
just my luck... What?
I said I'm really ill-fated!
you?
I'm the unlucky one!
keep him down!
just your luck?!
you're ill-fated?
there's trouble
jie's being held by the Taiwan gang!
what?
let's go!
what? Still not talking?
No!
fine then! Drag him over here!
put him down!
I gave you a chance
now you'll regret it!
jie
there's quite a few of you!
you the leader then?
tell your people never to step foot in Shinjuku again
if I ever catch any of you again
I guarantee
it will be much worse than this
Jie... it's OK
how are you doing?
hang on
hand... give me back the hand
you want his hand?
sure
you want the hand?
here!
quickly, let's go home
let's go!
let's go!
go, quickly!
perhaps... I should have killed him!
auntie Hao, the doctor is here
quickly... come in
the doctor is here
the doctor is here
this is unacceptable!
we should go and teach Gao a lesson!
Yes, we should chop off his hands!
and scoop out his brains! Right?
chop them up
let's go!
Hey, what are you doing?
you think he's stupid enough to sit and wait for us?
aren't we going to pay him back?
you like talking about it?
if you want, just do it, don't talk about it!
don't be impulsive, calm down
let's think this through!
what do we do?
jie, what do you want? Water?
I want my hand
give me my hand...
I know you and Eguchi are tight
I know he'll come tonight
Togawa-san
is the head of Togawa-gumi in agreement?
Eguchi-san has been good to me
Gao-san, I represent my father today
you won't be disappointed
you mean, the offer...
...is something I can't refuse?
my father said...
if you kill Eguchi
he will give you Kabuki-cho
on opening night
did you see Eguchi's wife?
Yes, she's quite pretty
she's... Yuko, right?
her name is Xiu Xiu
she used to work as a hostess
she looks very Japanese!
boss, we're really going to do it?
I've wanted to for a long time
had I not played hard to get...
that wily Togawa would not have agreed to my terms!
ask the Japanese staff to go home
then get the place ready
Eguchi-san is here
welcome. - Thank you
business has been good this month
especially at shop 2
it's up 20 percent from last month
see here
faster than I expected
yes
it should do even better next month
yes
grab him!
sorry, boss!
I don't really want to kill you!
kill!
run!
kill him! Kill him!
run!
not here! Go!
I... have seen you before
thank you
they're back... Step aside!
deputy chairman
I apologise for your fright!
darling
are you all right?
I'm fine
your old friend saved me
I'm going to change, please attend to him
are you hurt?
no, it's nothing
mum, is he your friend?
this is my daughter, Ayako
were you bitten by a mosquito?
she looks like you
steelhead
don't think badly of me
don't be silly
I was just a little worried
now I feel better
you're doing all right
I am now called Eguchi Yuko
don't worry, I understand
Ayako, come here
thank him for me
he says thank you
tell him that before Gao tried to kill him
a young man named Togawa came to see him
before you arrived at the bar
a man called Togawa was there
ask him what he's doing now?
he wants to know what you are doing now?
just crappy jobs
just small jobs here and there
if he is willing to help me
I will pay him well
however much he wants
he asks
if you'll work for him
he can pay you well
however much you want
please tell him, it's all right
please thank him
go home and see your mother if you can
she cries every time she thinks of you
can you believe the irony?
your ex saves your husband's life
I'm sorry
branch leader Togawa Taro actually asked an outsider to kill his sub-head
if we don't expel him there will be unrest
Where's your proof?
if you slander my father again, I'll kill you!
what do you intend to do?
shut up!
any more and you will leave!
Sanwa-kai's secret of survival...
...is unity!
whoever brings up the word "expel" again...
won't get away with it
Eguchi
I can't see why Togawa would want to kill you
do you?
Eguchi has been eyeing Kansai
that's why I think the Osaka faction did it
give me a little time to investigate
go bow to Togawa-gumi's leader
wipe out the past
let's make a peaceful new start
Steelhead, how's he doing?
fever's not gone?
no, a bit delirious
maybe he's having nightmares
steelhead
a Japanese guy to see you
this reminds me of home when I was a kid
please sit down
is this your girlfriend?
I'm Lily
you are very fluent
would you translate please?
he wants me to translate
there's no need
I want you to get rid of two guys for me
why me?
I can't use my own men
who are these two men?
one is the head of Togawa-gumi
the other is the head of Sanwa-kai, Muranishi
OK, I'll do it
but you have to agree to all my terms
firstly
you need to get me legal status in Japan
then, you'll give me the Taiwan gang's territories!
we not only have the same tastes
we also work the same way
Togawa-gumi is crazy!
we can't sit around and do nothing!
I'm going to kill you!
maruyama is dead!
attack with full force!
go!
recent attacks in Shinjuku...
have been classified critical
ordinary citizens are in danger
Togawa!
to prevent things from going out of control
the area commanders will take control
organised Crime Division
Eguchi Toshinari, head of the Eguchi clan,
his follower Nakajima Hiromasa
and the late Muranishi Koichi...
were close...
that guy Tanaka... isn't he a political bigwig?
what are they doing?
black gold politics has existed forever
don't be naive
gangs, yakuza, showbiz
you can't separate one from the other these days
it's called capitalism
the dead have no more value
but the riches in this world still do
vengeance must be resolved
in-fighting must cease
Eguchi...
...is hereby appointed head of Sanwa-kai
Togawa Taro is dead
kyohei is Togawa Taro's heir
he'll handle the same territories
I've asked two friends to be witnesses
any opposition?
Tanaka-san is elderly
don't give him cause for worry
you'll follow his orders, right?
we will watch over you
you catch my drift?
Kitano-san, they're coming over
why is he beside Eguchi?
Kabuki-cho's merchant list
give Shinjuku territories to Steelhead
boss, that's not right
how can I explain it to our men?
the Chinese cannot be trusted!
he saved my life
what's wrong with giving Gao's territory to him?
letting the Chinese control the Chinese might work
more importantly he will draw Togawa arrows like a bullseye
but, boss...
enough, just do as I say
I can't go against the boss' orders
but I want you to know
I, Nakajima Hiromasa, despise you people!
brothers, onward to Shinjuku!
may wealth pour in
brother Steelhead, congratulations
we old immigrants will count on you from now
come... come...come...
let's have a drink, thanks...
Steelhead-san
this gift is from the head of Eguchi clan
he wishes you prosperous business
thank you
here, take this inside
is this protection fee?
this stops from next month
but it's the tradition
Yes, yes!
it's unfair to you all
we've all crossed the seas to get here
making it alive wasn't easy
we should work together
how can I take advantage of my own people?
besides
in future, when my brothers do business in Kabuki-cho
running a noodle shop or Chinese restaurant
they will still need your help
then...
what happens when there's trouble?
what trouble?
there are lots of drunken louts here
can't you call the cops?
no, they're always gang members
our licenses will be affected if there's trouble
true? Right?
brother, Kabuki-cho lives by one law in the day
and another by night
if you don't take this money
it will incite more fights when others find out
I'll take it for now
we'll treat it as a loan
when I make a profit, I will return it
no... no need to return
you have your work cut out for you
for instance, improve the safety here
and don't let the young ones sell drugs
thank you, big brother
thank you... We'll take our leave
see you...
thank you, big brother... Thank you
jie
you've finally made it
I hope you can forget the past
Jie... Jie, what are you doing? Let go...
Jie... Jie, let go!
how could you?
let's go... Iet's go
go quickly... Jie... Jie...
don't push me! Are you on his side or mine?
Steelhead...
hey Jie, what are you doing?
what? You want to hit me?
calm down. 30 percent is fate, the rest is a battle
you can only win if you love a good fight
Come........ bottom's up
the old wine from home is still best
Ganbei! Steelhead
we wouldn't be here without you
what are you saying!
don't fight, let's drink to Steelhead!
Steelhead, to you!
we have achieved some results today
but we all know in our hearts
this was achieved through illegal means
we can't do that in the long-term
I opened this Kabushiki Gaisha
because I wanted us to have a legal business
to run an entertainment club on the lowest rent
a licensed one, not illegal
and, to grab the control of the Taiwan gang
so that we can protect ourselves
we hear you, Steelhead
we'll follow your lead
we have all suffered
that's why I want to set aside some money
to help those who have just arrived. Help them find jobs
I want this responsibility to go to...
how about to Jie?
everyone OK?
good!
then I would like to do something that interests me
in future, the business here will go to...
...It's yours, Hong Kong Boy
I'm not sure if I can
you'll have Tai Bo and Hu, they have experience
try it out
remember, be united!
jie, any problems?
thank you
thank you, everyone
a toast to Steelhead, cheers!
come... come, drink
steelhead
we're tired, we're going to go
OK, go on then
congratulations, you finally made it
what do you mean?
I want to see if you are illegal
so you finally got it
you owe me one
I let you go once, the debt is paid
just once? That's worth a life?
half the debt then?
OK, half!
I hope you can be a good man
because I don't want to...
come after you one day
that'd be just great!
one, two, three
you have more grey hair
I'm forty something!
finding me old?
in your heart
what's the most important thing in life?
that's a loaded question
man's most original wants...
were for food and shelter
but when we see what we don't have...
our desires grow
Xiu Xiu, what are you looking at? Why so many people?
look... there's a fridge, and a color TV
go back. Let's just take a look
you'll break the windows! Go home!
let's go... don't look, it's no big deal
look at her! Let's go... come on
I want to find a job out there one day
don't go, you'll never come back
why do you say that?
because the city is vibrant
it's colorful, and different from here
if you go, you won't want to return
you're wrong. - Are you sure?
you're wrong. - I'm dead right
since becoming a wife and mother
I know what I value in life
you have to learn to be content
when people have been oppressed...
...or when they have certain demands
when they have established a force
that force evolves into power
mobs have historically been formed like this
unfortunately, power changes people
from passive and tolerant, they begin to get aggressive
they lose control of themselves
more than 1. 5m foreigners living in Japan
what a broken and dirty place!
how can anyone live here?
what are you saying? I used to live here!
it's smelly!
wasn't this cooked by my mother?
she's been dead so many years, and it's still here!
damn it
Where's that bastard Tai Bo?
here, here
Why's the place so run down?
stop shouting
we're businessmen now
cut the crap! Where's the stuff?
come, have a look 500 pills
one kilo, the money?
you only deliver once a week
how am I going to make money?
cops have been clamping down, there's not enough goods
just add some ketamine, you'll be high in no time
Shizuko, I just bought a convertible
I want to take you for a spin
I'm busy
is it because of this?
I've already gone for laser treatments
it will disappear soon
I guarantee it will disappear!
what's going on?
it's... a friend
friend? When did I become a friend?
if we're friends, how come you can't even look at me?
what's your problem?
what are you looking at?
it's very cute
stop, don't hit him!
what?
what's up?
don't aggravate him
go in for a drink, OK?
let's all go in!
what are you guys up to?
how can you let foreigners trample all over your turf?
Eguchi brought them in
why didn't you question Eguchi?
he's the boss. I have no such right
eguchi, let me ask you something
master, what's the matter?
who are those Chinese people?
it's better if they take care of certain things
it's OK to use them
but you can't let them build up power
they're just our chess pieces
it's OK to have chess pieces
you can't let your own people suffer
I will be honest with you
that's my plan exactly
I want to use them to take care of Kyohei
master
I think Sanwa-kai needs to re-organise
about that...
let's talk later
don't be too conspicuous, understand?
definitely, sorry to trouble you!
damn it!
ruled by ambition
time to let him go
can you do it?
come in!
Kitano-san
have some tea
very fragrant
it's the best oolong tea
hard to believe that
so much success in so short a time
it's just a small business
this is not small
Roppongi, Aoyama and Shibuya, all yours now
it's not small!
these are papers on Toka Shouji Trading Company
police already lD-ed you as Katou-gumi
the biggest foreign gang in Japan
you must be mistaken
you even dare sell drugs
if you have proof, arrest me
what are you trying to say?
your men must be hiding things from you
secretly working with Eguchi
who's working with Eguchi?
it's your buddy Jie
if it is him, I will stop him
don't delay
but I have a request
you're in no position to ask
don't arrest my people
impossible! Cops arrest crooks, that's the game
but...
if you find evidence incriminating Eguchi
I can help with certain things
steelhead
I've wanted to ask you
Muranishi Koichi, Togawa Taro
did you kill them?
you speak out of turn!
Steelhead, ignore him
no matter what, I need time
steelhead
I have repaid my debt in full
big brother
Where's Hong Kong Boy?
he's just gone out, back soon
my number will win
I've won! You lucky bastard
there are guests here, keep it down
he told you to pipe down
he's talking to you
what are you saying? Shut up
you looking for trouble?
where are you from?
we're Katou-gumi
let me teach you a lesson
punch him!
let go... Iet go!
let go! Do you want to die?
you dare hit big brother?
do you know who he is? Brother Steelhead!
are you OK?
who are they?
jie's followers
they just arrived, they're ignorant
it's a mess
you again? Goldie!
is that you? Always making trouble!
apologise! Apologise now!
sorry, big brother!
go! Run!
how did Eguchi look for Jie?
he has a lot of men
you told him to take care of the new ones
are we a triad gang now?
it's for survival, don't interfere
when I came over
most of the people got caught
you were lucky
perhaps
steelhead
why don't we leave Japan?
to go where?
I have a good friend in Brazil
what language do they speak there?
I think it's Portuguese
what can I do there?
something that lets you sleep at night
I can't leave them behind
don't be naive
life is one big mistake
how many can you help? Or save?
you can't do anything
why have you called me here?
I don't look after domestic disturbances!
as long as you don't arrest my people
I will turn evidence against Eguchi
Eguchi asked me to kill Muranishi and Togawa
Steelhead... what are you doing?
have you gone mad? Are they worth it?
are they worth this?
it's all lies
pay him no heed
he's only trying to save his brothers
he's lying to you!
he's lying!
what are you trying to do?
do you want Eguchi go to jail
so Xiu Xiu will come back to you?
have you ever considered my feelings?
you are so selfish!
steelhead
let's just leave, OK?
Lily, I can't live in regret
who do you live for?
your brothers?
your ex-girlfriend?
or for me?
she seems to have fallen for you
if I were her
I'd kill you
gao, if you want back Kabuki-cho
you'll have to rely on yourself
Yes!
kill Kyohei and Tanaka for me
what do I get?
all the Chinese territories go to you
Eguchi-san
your men have all betrayed you
now is the time for us to use the Bushido way
to get rid of the Chinese pigs!
aren't we here for war? What are we waiting for?
shut up and sit down and eat
they're talking upstairs
what if they don't listen to you?
then send them all back to China
they have legal documents
let's play it by ear!
aren't you afraid I'll run?
it's a lifelong job going after guys like you
steelhead
what are you doing?
isn't he a cop?
the cops know you are a criminal outfit
what's this you and us stuff?
aren't we one family?
chairman Eguchi
I was just looking for you!
why are you in cahoots with him?
be clear in what you say
you worked with him first. What about you?
when did you join the cops?
how could you deal drugs?
don't just pick on me
could I have done all this alone?
all of you are in this?
no... not me
they said they wanted to
if you did it, then own up!
Hey, you didn't want to run things
you just upped and left
now, you lecture us?
can you hear yourself?
stop squabbling
ingrate! Don't talk to me!
Tai Bo... Stop quarrelling
lao Gwei! Why are you speaking for him?
we're only making some money, what's the big deal?
we didn't sell to the Chinese
steelhead
since we all agreed to it
keep out of it
the cops want to catch someone, who?
me!
what have you turned into?
especially you. Look at you!
you look like a ghost, you know that?
ghost?
if there is one, you let it out
you're the real ghost!
wake up!
Steelhead, you've done all you can
leave it for now
you can't leave!
don't let them leave Get away...
you can't leave... Get away!
you know the repercussions of attacking a cop?
we're family, stop fighting
are you crazy?
you treat the cops as family?
if you follow him, it's a dead end!
you are the one heading for a dead end
you've forgotten you killed someone?
I killed
I did it for you!
stop bullshitting!
you killed the border guard so you could see your woman
you killed the yakuza because you wanted legal status
for the money, for yourself!
so what if I did? Didn't you get something too?
didn't all of you get something?
all you have today, who fought for it?
without me, where would you be?
you really want to talk like that?
when you first came to Japan
who looked out for you?
without me, you'd be eating turd!
didn't I risk my life too?
Steelhead, you're wrong to say that
what? Want to take me on?
the matter wouldn't end there
the Japanese won't let you go
he won't let the Chinese take power
he'll destroy you sooner or later!
Kitano-san has already said he only wants Eguchi
if you stop your activities
he'll let you go
don't fall for it
if I fall, you all fall
get them!
don't move!
Kitano-san
get away!
wait
calm down, Steelhead
go back with me
jie
just kill me
jie
shoot! Don't do this!
jie
go away
have you gone mad?
a knife? This is not child's play
we can talk about anything
and come to an agreement
chinese don't fight Chinese...
breaking my winning streak
you want my life?
what do you expect from me?
go up!
come!
hong Kong Boy
check on Lao Gwei, hurry. Help him
let's get upstairs
jie, no
jie
don't leave. You're all dead!
Hey, come out!
go up!
go!
steelhead
get away!
don't... don't...
go
fang, help!
jie, run
run, run!
no, Eguchi
Eguchi
kobayashi, it's me
bring men down to Toka Shouji
quickly!
I can't believe Nakajima sold me out
this is for you
all the information is in there
your cop friend can get a promotion
I think... I could have gone out with a bigger bang
Eguchi
nakajima, Eguchi is dead
he said, he'll come back as a ghost to haunt you
give me the knife!
don't let him go
Steelhead!
Dai!
Dai! Dai!
go!
Steelhead, here
there are stairs outside
Kitano, are you OK?
open fire if they resist, let's go!
don't run!
steelhead
it seems
I'm still a coward
stop doing this, Jie!
Xiu Xiu, is that you?
what's happened?
stay calm
Eguchi is dead
quickly pack and find a safe hideaway
how about this?
bring your daughter
to the Okubo station, I'll wait for you. Hurry!
well?
speak up!
tell us!
you'll regret not talking
your kid will die. Speak!
ayako
don't...
Ayako...
what happened?
the cops are here
go to Okubo station now
take care of Steelhead!
where are you?
Okubo station
I'm on my way
get me a car
over there
there
are you OK?
don't shoot!
Nakajima!
hold your fire
stop, don't shoot!
emergency! Officer down!
how many men are down?
get an ambulance here...
Steelhead! Steelhead!
Steelhead!
Steelhead!
hang on!
your lung must be punctured!
it's no use
I have repaid my debt
Steelhead!
we can call it even
what did you say?
Steelhead, what did you say?
30 percent is ate
the rest is a battle
you can only win if you love a good fight
Friday?
it's far too early for this.
traitor!
all right, I surrender.
well, I'm awake now!
stirred up with envy and revenge"!
I'll get you back and when you least expect it.
still, out of good, means to find evil.
let me out.
let me out!
you're lucky that trap's not finished.
it's getting poison spikes fitted tomorrow.
I will kill you, crusoe, or die in the attempt.
that... that was my pledge.
OK! You not hold me.
game's over, friday.
and when I get out...
you got a fever? You look like you're sick.
save your false words.
poison?
poison! - Snakebite?
so, you confess.
what's your medicine for snakebites?
wily snake!
infernal serpent!
tell me. You have to help me.
I am not your lieutenant!
look at me. This is serious! Hey, friday! Don't pass out on me.
no, no, no! Friday?
enemy...
of mankind.
I will get you an antidote, ok?
you'll be all right.
you have my word.
traitor. Traitor.
what we needed was gangrene, much less sawing and tearing off the leg.
one more word, it'll be your last, I swear.
snakebite.
Snakebite!
Antivenom: Jergon sacha." Jergon sacha!
if it is a nurse, save you.
I need your help!
that's what you promised me last time.
God! You're stealing.
I need antidote jergon sacha.
snakebite? - Where is it?
show me the wound. - It's not me. It's friday.
don't do that.
two days it took me to sort things out.
from a to j, from k to Z. - Jergon sacha.
which is the parasitic vine.
it has to be freshly harvested before it flowers.
distinctive bites of the snake.
it should be chopped, immersed and immediately ingested.
you've been doing your homework.
there's only 2 things that get you left alone on a ship:
standing in a crow's-nest and learning a medical book.
and surgeons don't climb rigging.
he'll be dead by now.
what?
immediately ingested. It's an urgent cure.
I'm sorry. You're too late.
Oh, I shouldn't have left him.
he didn't know me.
he swore he'd kill me.
it doesn't sound like snakebite to me.
if it's not a snakebite, he could still be alive.
come with me. Come and see. No, no! Listen! Listen.
I'll give you anything you want.
everything I have is yours: Money, gold. Please.
this is the last thing I'll ask of you, I swear. Please.
all right.
Hello, boy.
Friday!
on his shoulder!
evil for you. I'll do good so as to fight evil.
why do I do evil?
hold him still.
and the thought of lost happiness and lasting pain, torments him.
where have I heard those words?
round he throws his baleful eyes "that witness'd huge affliction and dismay."
paradise lost. I've been reading it to him.
Milton?
Mix'd with obdurate pride and stedfast hate.
have you nothing lighter than the fall of mankind?
how about a sonnet?
I see thy fall determined.
Where's his part of the castle?
up here.
well, I can guess who had first choice of bedroom.
he prefers things natural.
what are we looking for?
anything he could've eaten or drunk, tracks from a snake or scorpion.
you don't know, do you?
honey? - Don't!
it was no snakebite.
your friend was stung by a wasp.
there was 2 puncture marks.
two of them.
enough to poison him?
it's not... don't blame the wasp.
it's the honey that is poisoned.
they were just protecting it.
is there an antidote?
I need to look it up.
where?
my books, back in the camp.
And?
I like you better the other way.
come on, get inside. Let's go. Let's go. There's a timeline here.
put it down and lend us a hand.
it's called a mallet.
sir, there's a fellow in need up there.
where is he?
No! No, no, no!
poisoned honey.
causes: Hallucinations, delusions, high fever and, if untreated, death.
what are you doing?
the men are losing patience with you.
I had to amputate a leg today.
if he dies, you are...
maybe I'll amputate your insolent tongue, boy.
now get me a drink!
quicker!
here.
more.
anaesthetic.
put him over here.
he'll be more comfortable there. Are you all right?
that I'm not, a lot of rage.
they shouldn't let him bully you.
they?
they're just watching their own skin.
OK, let me see.
Yes! An antidote.
I've never seen this plant on this island.
do you know it?
no, I don'T.
Tropical," which is promising, "grows in rock - exposed areas.
tolerates harsh environment, direct sun.
if it's here, I know where it'll be.
crush the leaves. Boil until water clears. Good.
listen. How much time do I have?
only hours.
his fever hadn't taken hold.
when it does...
find the plant quickly and I'd say he has a chance.
thank you.
it's rude to sneak up on people.
your friend is right to think you're simple.
my friend does not think me simple.
Satan, then. I would've stuck with simple. We should hurry.
we?
what colour of flower has this plant?
what hue of leaf?
you'll poison him with a guess.
I won't have my work undone by ignorance.
whatever you say, olivia-oliver.
this way.
for you send a plague!
did you think I'd be afraid, crusoe?
where are you, crusoe?
come out! Come out!
have a drink.
you like to give orders, don't you?
excuse me. Would you like a drink?
was that rowley?
you should've let me deal with him.
Rowley doesn't frighten me.
no man frightens me.
I can see inside them because of what I am.
obviously, I have to cut a hole in them first.
you can't see a man's soul or a man's spirit with a knife.
snake!
I know that move.
it's called overreaction.
does your book say anything about having the time to play games?
it was for future reference: Jergon sacha, snake antivenom.
look. See how it resembles the one it can cure?
it's funny how nature pairs things: A natural pair for every being.
yours is in a cage under a tree palace, speaking poems.
mine is in england waiting for me.
my wife, susannah.
what would susannah think about you raiding your enemy's camp, risking your life for your new friend?
before friday, I merely existed.
he showed me how to live.
if I do get off this island and back to susannah, it's because of him.
that's why it hurt so much when he called me a traitor.
I'm sure you've heard worse.
I've heard the same for a crime just as great.
which was?
monmouth's rebel army was gathering against the king.
I was travelling, too, on trade.
a family to feed.
I didn't know the rebels had already been routed.
the king's soldiers were hunting them down.
all those involved were branded traitors and sentenced to death.
help from you, sir.
will you help a stranger?
what can I do?
can you spare some water?
it's not for me.
it's for the boy.
I heard cannon fire last night.
that was the rebellion, such as it was.
it's over?
we had the lord on our side.
the king had the cavalry.
we were all lined up for a night attack when their muskets shelled upon us.
thank you.
here, my son.
he's changed his mind.
we can only keep moving, sir.
the king's men will have us if we don'T.
are you one of us, sir?
I'm... I'm just a merchant.
vouch for yourself.
king james will not forgive any man that has stood up against him.
I expect they'll hunt us all down now after this.
where will you go?
the boy asked for his mother.
I'm taking him to her.
who's there?
who else?
no one. I'm alone.
I'll take as much of the fine lace as you can make.
that'll give you 5% of the asking price if you give me 6 weeks to pay it.
search the outbuildings.
you've nothing to fear from the rebels.
they've taken the worst of it.
God bless them.
bless them, indeed.
you're not a supporter.
just looking out for my family.
but not their future.
who's is that horse outside?
mine. What of it?
who are you?
I'm robinson crusoe, here to do business with abigail furnham, the lace maker.
I'll see your letter of passage.
sir, rebels! They've been hiding them in the barn!
sir, go!
arrest the lace maker and robinson crusoe!
he's getting away! After him!
she saved my life that day and I could do nothing for her.
I knew they'd show her no mercy.
what did you think of her?
brave or foolish?
brave. This is the place.
if the plant's not here, then...
well, let's hope it is and that we find it quickly.
you stay here.
I'm gonna continue further on up to the rocks.
please?
Oh, good.
don't shout that. Not ever!
no one will hear.
one word, one careless moment and I'm your lace maker, except death would be a welcome relief.
I'm sorry, truly.
now, is that your plant?
forever in need of an assistant.
I've always had a keen eye.
that's our plant.
at once as far as angels ken, he views...
the dismal situation waste and wild.
a dungeon horrible.
a dungeon horrible on all sides round.
a dungeon horrible on all sides round.
on all sides round as one great furnace flam'D.
as one great furnace flam'D.
yet... - yet from those flames...
...no light.
but rather darkness visible.
so!
I'll control your descent.
my descent?
you're lighter. It's safer.
standing up here is much safer.
you scared of heights?
I could lower you down.
I'll go alone.
you don't trust a woman?
when I give you a signal, you can help me back up.
does that still count as doing it alone?
just in case, what would you like on your gravestone?
Robin or robinson crusoe?
OK.
I can't climb up.
grab hold!
what's it tied to?
just take it.
I can't reach it.
don't look.
close your eyes.
ready.
let's hope our sacrifice is in time.
you've done your best.
I promised I'd be back for him.
I gave him my word.
a surgeon can give his word like that.
the patients don't call him a liar.
the world hears the praise of the living and thinks him a man of honour.
I don't care what the world thinks.
but I do care about those that matter most to me.
how did you get past the gates?
judge jefferies has named you a traitor to the king.
I know.
he had abigail furnham burned alive.
the rebels are on gibbets along the bridge-water road.
you shouldn't have come back.
I did not join them.
I did not break my promise. I need you to know that.
take the children and go back to your father.
he's disowned us.
what?
because i wouldn't disown you.
I don't--I don't know what to do.
I do. Will you trust me?
stay away from the windows.
I never meant to make this more dangerous for you.
I don't care about that.
I care about you.
Susannah's gone to mr. Blackthorn.
they've come up with a plan.
and it better be a good one.
I'm to sail to the new world.
when? - Today.
father, you will see me again.
I'm sure I will.
susannah will get me a pardon.
when it's safe for me to return, she'll put a notice in the gazette.
you'll never see that.
one way or another...
I will.
so, we mark about the crusoes...
we do choose our women well.
although to be honest, robin, I think they do the choosing.
perhaps you can find a space in your baggage for a keepsake of us.
your preacher's bible?
with the family history written in.
wherever you may find yourself, this is who you are.
you are my son.
always will be.
don't forget.
what will you do?
stay at home.
pay my taxes.
try not to draw attention.
what is it, boy? What is it?
he's gone.
this way.
out.
steadfast hate.
down! Down!
obdurate pride.
at least he's still alive.
you must be a brilliant surgeon.
what's happening?
stay away from the railings.
go, go, go! We need to keep him near. This way.
he's trying to kill you. Where else would he go?
now what?
give it to me.
now who's giving the orders?
it needs to be chopped.
that anaesthetic you have? - Yeah.
will it work from a dart?
Yes, it knocks out rowley. Why?
OK.
these are hollow.
and these are sailmaker's needles.
if I can fashion this into a dart and fill this with the anaesthetic,
I may be able to shoot it into friday.
a blowpipe? - Right.
if we can stop him from attacking me long enough, we may be able to give him the antidote.
that's a big "if."
I'm open to all sorts of ideas here.
here. - Thank you.
not a fan of milton?
pretentious pig.
he's a great poet.
how long do those need to boil?
until it clears.
ocean journeys are long.
even mediocre poets are a distraction.
I'll bet it's very lonely for you living as oliver.
why did you leave susannah?
leave her? No.
she was not on your ship.
I was returning to her.
then you had to leave? - No, I had no choice.
where there's life there is choice.
staying would've cost me my life.
I might as well have joined the rebels because, in the end, I had to flee like one.
Robin, don't argue, please.
if there was any other way out, we'd be taking it.
your wife knows what she's talking about.
you're a lucky man, robin.
she's more than I deserve.
let me pledge this.
you must agree to it, both of you.
should any mishap occur to you
and let us not suppose that it will-but if it did,
I will take full legal control of your children.
now you understand what this means?
one day, all that I have will be theirs.
why, for that, I'd be tempted to offer myself here and now.
that's more like it.
farewell, robin. - Thank you.
I put something in your bible to remember us by.
I love you.
I love you.
is that from the arrow?
no, it's nothing. - No, let me see.
I'm the surgeon. - What?
you can bandage better with one arm than I can with two?
like you can climb a cliff alone better than with my help.
it's noble to see someone risking so much for a friend.
old friend.
when friday recovers, promise me you won't tell him how worried I was.
I'll never hear the last of it.
you don't think we're too late, do you?
a dungeon horrible, on all sides round...
as one great furnace flam'D.
obdurate pride, steadfast hate.
you're ill.
listen to me, friday.
friday, we have a cure.
friday, you're my brother.
remember the boat in the tree?
Yes, you do.
remember the dogs and the games?
you trip me, I trip you.
the dogs. - The dogs.
that's right. Remember the caves?
returning the bones?
it's crusoe and it's friday.
obdurate pride.
you have to trust me.
we have an antidote.
you have to drink it or you will die.
die!
friday, no!
father!
please.
are you all right?
we've got to find him.
half in here.
we'll split up, cover more area.
half? He needs all of it.
fine, then. I'll take it. You stay here.
what if you go the wrong way or the right way and he attacks you again?
he's dying.
does he give up if he sets his mind to something?
I am not waiting here. I can't do nothing.
he's still alive. He will come back, won't he?
he's sworn to kill you. It's our only hope.
well then, I've done nothing but hope for the last 6 years.
nothing but "maybe" and "if.
nothing but nothing!
God can't keep taking people away from me.
no. No. No, not this.
Robin. - Crusoe.
it's crusoe.
Friday!
so, you let him kill you?
stand away from me.
if he tries to kill me, at least I'll know where he's at.
and if he succeeds, he'll drop his weapon and you can give him the antidote.
you'd die to save him?
Yes, I would.
your friend is right, you're so simple!
go on! Kill him!
put him out of his misery.
I need your help.
you didn't want to have your work undone by ignorance. Remember?
friday deserves to live.
maybe I don't, but he does.
help me?
Friday!
you want crusoe dead?
I will kill your traitor.
you're not the only one he has badly used.
father!
give me the antidote.
come on. Come on, friday.
drink.
are we in time?
we're lucky our charade worked.
you were lucky.
for a moment, I was thinking of putting a musket ball in, not just gunpowder.
it didn't only come from me.
I love susannah.
I made a vow before god and for my whole life.
you could be rotting halfway down a cliff right now.
your wife may be in london. - No, don'T. Don'T.
I never let men near me.
don't make me feel like the temptress, crusoe.
did I win your bed in a game?
I do not like it.
well, you'll have to win back yours.
I'm not feeling too well.
will you read for me?
just a minute.
you weren't the temptress, but
for my disguise?
thank you, olivia. - Oliver.
I think I'm hallucinating.
I saw a woman walking into the forest.
sounds more like a fantasy to me.
how about some sonnets instead?
Sonnets!
did you get it? - Got it!
maybe next time, you dry your clothes where animals can't reach!
boars don't usually come through the base of the tree house.
how was i supposed to know?
Oh, you could have left it, crusoe!
you have other shirts!
true, but it's not like I can go out and buy another one, is it?
besides, I like this one.
it is a very nice shirt. - Thank you!
shall we go now?
or has a monkey stolen your favourite pair of trunks?
you know what I also had? - What?
a lovely pair of slippers. I miss those.
they went down with the ship.
it was truly a tragic day.
you know what else I miss? Soap!
what I wouldn't give...
you're not on holiday! Put your backs into it!
we could use some help!
and you could use a good lashing!
that's atkins and mutineers.
they're cutting timber to repair their ship.
we should stay out of this area for a while.
when do you think they'll finish repairing the ship?
I think it will be a while.
but when they do, we'll make their ship ours.
that is not the best of ideas, perhaps.
I agree. But, unfortunately for us, ships don't grow on trees.
not usually, anyways.
it's not the best-looking boat in the world, but...
if we fix her up, she'll float.
how did it get up there?
a flood, perhaps? - Possibly.
or a hurricane could have put it up there.
lucky for us, this one had a soft landing.
all that work I did trying to build my own, and look at this!
a gift in a tree! - Ah, yes!
the boat that you built!
and what a fine seaworthy creation that was!
it wasn't that bad.
it was a good boat...
until it got into the water.
well, it's not as easy as it looks.
and we need all the help we can get, with the strange currents and tides around this place.
eventually, this cld sail us away from here.
but the boat is in the tree.
how are you going to get it down without breaking it?
easy!
we set up a system of bamboo poles and a pulley.
and the boat will float...
gently down.
steady...
steady...
it feels like...
and the boat will just glide down gently." No problem!
you're hilarious!
at least it's on the ground now.
a few more poles...easy...
are you finished? - No.
still, it's not my fault the bloody rope broke.
it was quite funny, thougH.
remind me to laugh later.
doesn't look like we did any more damage that wasn't already here.
hello.
he must have been sailing by when the storm struck.
let's hope we don't suffer the same fate!
Hey!
what is it?
the way to england!
it's a compass.
a working compass...
it can take us to england?
no, but it can show us which direction we're going.
with this, we can find ourselves to friendly port.
and from there, we can get a ship.
then we can head back to england.
come on, let's take this back to the tree house and fix it there.
all this time on the island, I thought we'd never escape.
but now we have a boat and a compass.
it's meant to be.
we will need a sail.
we have.
the roof of the tree house are made of sails.
and a mast. That's easy enough. Don't worry.
it is just that there is much to do to fix it, crusoe.
but it can be fixed!
listen, this used to be a work of fine craftsmanship.
now, we can't duplicate that, but we can patch it up.
how?
we'll soften saplings with steam, and we'll bend them to shape to reframe it.
we'll sheath it with sail canvas, and we'll seal it with tree resin and beeswax.
we can do it all here in the workshop.
you are sure it will work?
of course I'm sure!
and we'll check it in the water to see if it floats, just to make sure she's all right.
you keep calling the boat "she." Why?
I don't know, really. I suppose if I had to guess, I'd say...
because they can be beautiful and graceful.
and they can take you around the world if you treat them well.
and you are sure about all this?
we fix this boat, we get off the island.
trust me.
so...
what is it like in england?
it's the same as anywhere, really.
just different buildings, different faces, different customs.
are they good people like you?
I'm not all good. - But you are decent.
and you're honest.
and you saved my life.
true.
in that case, no, they're not all like me.
some are better; some are worse.
some you can trust; some, you can'T.
some seem trustworthy until you try-- - like who?
my brother-in-law, samuel tuffley.
to look at him, you'd think he was a decent man.
he's got good clothes, good manners.
we had no reason to doubt him.
the money you put in goes to rent a fleet, hire the crews and equip them for a year's adventure.
that already sounds expensive.
well, the crews come cheap.
we pay them in shares on their return.
fifty percent goes to them, and the rest, in pure profit, to us.
trading in what?
Mmm, that's at each captain's discretion.
half the art's in choosing good men and letting them...
do what they do.
I heard you live above your warehouse.
until we can afford something better.
a warehouse...
despite having that big loan from blackthorn to prop you up?
nobody knows about that.
everyone knows.
do you think he'd miss a few more thousand?
the man's too busy buying up half of london to build his museum.
that's his affair.
jeremiah blackthorn doesn't care for money at all.
I do.
and so should you.
my sister grew up in a fine house.
well, when I saw the ship, I fired my gun!
they were too far away to hear it, but they saw the smoke.
I told them that I was an englishman and that I had made my escape out of slavery.
they very kindly asked me to come on board, and they took me in.
I was once more delivered from the most miserable conditions of all life.
and what to do next with myself, I was now to consider...
more story, please! - More story?
tomorrow.
no wonder she won't sleep.
on the heels of every story rides the critic!
did you hear from my brother?
I did.
and I'm not sure if it's a good time for us to be investing in his scheme.
a young man once said to me that with the money he got from his stock, he'd buy a horse.
ride out and buy from the weaver!
you should never trust anything young men say.
be careful who you trust.
now we just wait for the high tide to come in, and we sail her out to sea.
what about the mast?
I have another idea for that.
friday, can you give me a hand, please?
will this be strong enough? - Of course.
these spars have held the sails together in the strongest of winds.
you need to make sure that it is safe...
in case we're in a storm.
we're not taking it around the world together.
we're just going to the nearest friendly port.
it doesn't have to last a lifetime.
Yes, but it needs to last long enough to get us to safety.
what was that?
backed into the fire.
well, you shouldn't do that.
good advice!
what's the matter?
it's just that you cannot hurry these things.
I know that.
but the tides are in our favour right now.
and that's what's gonna get us off the island and me back to my family.
Where's the compass?
it's in the fire!
I am sorry, crusoe. I did not
it's fine, it's fine. It's not your fault.
can you fix it? - No.
no, the needle's melted. It'S...no.
well, that is it then.
we cannot leave. - No, it's all right.
everything's going to be all right because that is not the only compass on the island.
another compass?
wait, crusoe! Wait!
I think...
we should rethink this plan.
it'll be fine.
you know what atkins is like, crusoe.
he's watching for you.
he wants you dead.
they have a compass.
we need it, and they won't miss it.
will they not need a compass to go home, too?
no, they have other equipment.
quite frankly, I'm not enormously concerned with their welfare right now.
well, if they catch us, crusoe, they're going to kill us very, very slowly.
well, then we'll just have to make sure we don't get caught.
come on, put your back into it!
give the men their rations, mr. Mccane.
come on, let's move. Come on.
we need 2 men here!
he's mapping the reefs.
he's charting the currents and the tides.
aye, aye, captain! - Where should I put this powder?
we have to go before they find us.
I'm not leaving without that compass.
it will not do any of us any good if we are dead!
friday, you worry too much. Keep looking.
crusoe, I cannot find the compass. Let us go!
I'm not leaving without it!
did I not mention killing us slowly?
we have to be careful because every second we spend here places us in more danger.
what's your problem?
why won't you concentrate on this?
someone has to think of our safety first.
look at this. It's right in front of you!
I've never seen a compass before today!
I'm not familiar with these things!
I don't give a damn!
you don't mind captain taylor!
it's atkins. Come on.
are you mad? What are you doing here?
I just had to borrow this.
of course, when I say borrow, I mean take and never give back, but...
they're right there.
come on. - Come on.
are you trying to get yourself killed?
atkins is looking for you everywhere.
look, we're getting off the island.
we found a boat. All we need is this compass.
what's going to happen with me?
I'll send for help when I return.
you have my word!
they'll arrest the mutineers and put you back in charge.
are you taking him with you?
Yes, I am. - Of course!
you'll need money when you get back.
he should fetch a good price.
I will take that as a compliment.
he's not my slave.
he's my equal...
my better, in many ways, and my friend. You'll show him the same respect that you show me.
my apologies. I assumed that you...
appearances can be deceptive, can't they?
but then you know that, don't you?
you're a strange one.
what kind of a man are you?
I'm my own man.
what kind of man are you?
more of a man than some.
did I mention the "killing us slowly" part?
what?
when you were younger, did you have a wordbook?
a dictionary?
Yes. Why?
look up the word "trouble,
and you will see olivia's big picture right next to it.
of that, I have no doubt!
you have to go now!
they've stopped work on the ship.
do you have a plan on getting out of here?
Yes, of course. The same way we came in.
friday gets in the barrel, and I push him out.
right. That barrel over there?
stay behind the tents.
go quickly.
don't get caught.
you! Atkins, help!
the other way! Turn around!
get him! After him!
come back here!
come on!
wait, wait!
we can't lead them back to the tree house!
we'll lose them in the jungle!
hold!
you 4, split up. Go around.
take the side paths. Try and cut them off.
Nash, come with me.
what are you doing? - Slowing them down.
and slowing us down, too! Come on!
now, you're not going to slow me down, are you?
no, it, um...
it's feeling much better already.
what a relief!
we have to get back before the high tide.
there is plenty of time.
Yes, and we'd have much more time if we weren't running around the jungle.
they've circled around us.
this way!
we're surrounded.
Oh, they must have slipped past us.
Oh, really?
I thought maybe they grew wings and flew away.
idiot!
shall we keep looking?
I'm needed back at the camp.
I want this whole area patrolled.
and when you find him, bring him back to me.
and the slave, what about him?
shall we kill him? - No! Keep him alive.
good, strong arms, healthy teeth.
he'll fetch a good price.
let's go! Ok, come!
aye, aye.
I think they're gone.
if you think that atkins is angry now, what will it be like when he finds out at you have taken his compass?
don't you mean, when he finds out we've taken his compass?
Oh, no, no, crusoe, this was your plan, not mine!
I told you that this was too big of a risk to take.
I wouldn't have had to take a risk if you wouldn't have broke...
never mind.
we have the compass. That's the end of it.
OK, we can't go back the way we came in.
we have to find another way out.
what if we take the wrong direction?
we do not know this part of the island.
it's ok, we'll figure it out. We have this.
atkins said I'll fetch a good price.
ignore him. He's uneducated and coarse.
Yes, but in england, they will still see me in that way.
well, yes, there is a certain attitude.
but it's their problem, not yours.
in my experience, when everyone else has a problem, they soon make it your problem.
some people treat you badly regardless of the colour of your skin.
how did they treat you?
I've had my share of bad luck.
it seems to me that people with money have the best of luck.
how does money make them lucky?
it means they can pay to have a problem fixed, and they certainly don't end up with a debt they can't repay.
I'm not going back to mr. Blackthorn.
I'm not a man to take advantage.
which is probably why you're not rich.
Ouch!
I wouldn't have you any other way.
have you thought about the dowry money?
I swore to your father that I'd never touch it.
it's nearly 4, 000 pounds. - I know.
Robin, I'm not saying spend it.
but we've got to invest it somewhere.
I don't want to put it at risk.
well, I think we can trust my own brotheR.
and that, gentlemen...
makes you equal partners in your caribbean adventure.
worth drinking to, I'd say! - Not in my building.
and these are the letters of mark for your captains.
what are they? - It's just paperwork.
rather important paperwork.
without letters of mark to protect them, your crews will be tried as pirates if they were to be captured.
pirates?
instead of privateers.
it means the difference between a fair trial and a hanging.
but we're not pirates. - We're traders.
privateering is a trade.
stealing from the king's enemies on the high seas isn't piracy.
It's...a legal version of it.
be careful. - What?
I said be careful!
never daydream on a steep hill.
old family proverb.
Oh, really? That's a very specific proverb.
we like to keep things simple.
wait.
we should head down this way instead.
or maybe we should go this way, in the proper direction.
we'll go down there, and we'll get far enough over.
but that is the long way around.
maybe it is, but that's the way I'm going.
fine. Then I'll meet you there.
what's going on, friday?
one would think you didn't want to get off this island.
and they would be right.
I am going that way.
if you want to stay on the path, I cannot stop you.
but I'm going this way.
Friday!
Friday!
hang on, mate! Hang on!
Friday... friday!
are you all right?
are you hurt?
what is it? What is it?
Ah, it's my shoulder!
I think it's dislocated.
can you move your legs?
I can move my feet.
you're lucky.
this tree landed on a rock. It's raised at this end.
otherwise, it would have crushed your legs.
I can't move anything else.
OK... ok...
I'm gonna get you out. Hold on.
try and move this.
when I say so, put this rock in. I wanna fill the gap, ok?
OK.
you'll do it a few more times. After that, it'll get you out.
OK. Ready?
and...
come on!
can I wedge the rock in now?
I'm getting you out.
how, crusoe?
you going to make a saw out of leaves and a coconut?
maybe I could.
the mutineers...
the mutineers were cutting down trees. They'll have a saw.
I'll borrow it.
and when I say borrow...
saw now, crusoe! Joke later.
I'll be as quick as I can.
Friday? - Yes?
don't go anywhere, ok?
I will try!
Where's the bloody saw?
Where'd this water come from?
from the crevices.
I think it is flooding.
it's seawater.
this cave is tidal.
we're at sea level down here.
I told you we could cut across to the beach!
unfortunately, you were right.
this must be the high-tide line.
that means the tide is coming.
it will carry the boat away. You must go save it, crusoe.
we're both getting on that boat and leaving this island.
did they not have a smaller axe?
no, it's all they left. It's very inconsiderate of them.
Yes!
you must go save the boat.
this will not work.
it will.
you should go now.
I'll have you out soon.
not soon enough.
I'm going as fast as I can.
crusoe, just go!
back when you said you wouldn't come with me, - back when my compass broke-- - that was an accident.
I give you my word.
what is it then?
why don't you want to come back to england with me?
cause I know what it will be like.
I know the kind of people that are sold into slavery.
and they usually look like me, not you!
I'll help you. We can help each other.
crusoe, you have a life in england.
you have a home. You have a family.
I can not help you there.
Friday...
you're my friend.
you're probably the best friend I've ever had.
did you think I was just going to let you fend for yourself when you got to england?
I do not know.
if it wasn't for you, I never
I never would have survived.
we're just leaving one island, and we're going to another. That's it.
and when we get there, it will be my turn to help you survive.
my family needs me.
I haven't seen them in over 6 years.
and for all I know, they could be...
then one thing I know...
is that you and I are getting out of this cave, even if it's the last thing I do.
I owe you my life, crusoe.
today...
my debt has been repaid.
as I forfeit my life to you...
I free you to go and save the boat.
your life is worth more than some boat.
you said you needed me to help you to get back to england.
well, this is how I can help you...
by letting you go.
I'll think of something.
give my debts a meaning!
go... save yourself!
save the boat and get off this island!
hey...
tell stories about me.
and do not forget to tell them how handsome I am!
but first, you must get wet.
go...
I'm not going.
can you keep your head up?
yes...
but not for long.
Ah, if I had equipment from the tree house, I could move this easily!
go and get them!
and while you're at it, save the boat!
it'll take too long. By the time I got back, it'd be too late.
if I get you out of here, will you come back with me to england?
Oh, crusoe, I cannot get out...
then you might as well agree!
will you?
OK. Ok.
if I get out of this...
I will come with you to england.
Oh...
I have an idea.
remember, do not think about the target.
think about anything else.
I was so close. - No, that was not close.
I think you'll find it waS. - I think you'll find no.
you just need a little bit more practice, crusoe.
it is not supposed to be easy.
of course it is!
what's the point of making tools if it doesn't make the job easier?
otherwise, why bother?
tell that to the bow and the arrow.
I think it's these arrows.
I don't think they're straight. The aim is off.
give. Let me try.
well, the arrows seem fine to me.
I win... again.
OK, I think I said-- - you said best 2 out of 3.
what about best 3 out of 5?
and when I win that one, it's going to be best 6 out of 10?
listen, if I can hit this with my gun, then we're even.
OK.
I mean, I had to deal with a moving target.
Yes, of course! - No, I did.
look, the coconut's swinging all over the place!
Yes, I'm sure it is, crusoe.
how'd you do that?
I told you. Practice!
I think I'm gonna have to start cheating.
or practicing some more.
Friday...
Friday!
Friday!
I've got the other end tied to a counterweight.
when I release it, it should lift this off!
good!
I do not like the taste of seawater!
are you all right?
my shoulder hurts!
but I'm alive, thanks to you.
we may still be able to save the boat.
at least we still have the compass.
Yeah, you're right, I suppose.
I will get you to england somehow.
and you'll come with me...
no matter what prejudice we have to overcome.
england is a fine place, a fine and wonderful place.
when I think of all that's best about her, sometimes I forget the things that drove me to leave.
one by one, we see our freedoms disappear.
our city's charter is taken away. - That's right!
our movements are restricted! - Yeah! Right!
and we are barred from holding public office!
and what exactly is our crime? - Nothing!
we have a cavalier king who looks at us and sees only the sons and grandsons of those men who executed his father!
king james ii moves to build a divided kingdom!
right!
and who's to stop him?
what's going on?
a new rebellion, by the sound of it.
the duke of monmouth is raising an army against the king.
Monmouth!
a monmouth rebellion, eh?
well, the sooner he tries it, the sooner the army can cut him down.
what does this mean?
where?
you put there... the mark behind his name.
I would like to be informed...
if he is arrested.
well, if you want him protected...
why do you give me his name?
how's your shoulder?
Oh, crusoe, it is very -
that's for not wanting to come with me!
I agreed I would come! - Yes, but before that, you didn't!
how is it?
much better!
thank you!
so...
are we just going to stand here and stare at the boat until it disappears completely?
Yes. Yes, we are.
fair enough...
fair enough...
we will think of something, crusoe.
there's always another plan.
you're right.
we've always got the mutineers' ship.
no, crusoe. I meant another plan that will not get us killed.
but where would be the fun in that?
another great vacation getaway in the pegasus galaxy.
where is everyone?
there's smoke from the chimneys.
they're inside.
can't say I blame them.
there's nothing I hate More than a damp cold.
let's check this out.
howdy, folks.
who are you? - sheppard.
this is teyla, ronon, mckay.
you from ratira?
no.
from over the mountains, then?
a little further.
then you've come a long way.
you'll be in need of food and drink.
sit.
I take it you don't get Many strangers around here.
no.
especially not those That travel near dark.
why is that?
you really don't know?
what's your business here?
no business, really. We're just travelers.
then you best keep traveling.
Yeah.
all right.
wait.
goran, you can't send them out there.
they look like they can Take care of themselves.
it may not even start tonight.
it's been three months.
how much longer Do you think it'll wait?
Hi. what are you Talking about?
never heard of it.
it lives in the forest. It'll be feeding soon.
and it is, what,
some kind of an animal, or...
it's a creature.
it has the appearance of a man,
but it can suck the very Life from your bones.
leaves only a dead Withered husk behind.
sounds familiar.
look
we know you're not used to dealing with strangers,
but we may be able to help you with this little problem You're having.
we're used to dealing with this kind of thing.
we call them the wraith.
these are the creatures from the old stories?
from the time of the cullings?
so you have heard of them.
Yes, but the histories of them are incomplete.
they tell of the great ships That descended from the sky,
but there's no description of the wraith themselves,
although there were A few among us
who guessed that daimos Might be one of them.
Why?
because it, too, Came from the sky.
it was about 10 years ago.
a bright light appeared Above the village...
crashed into the hills.
we didn't know what it was,
but people were terrified.
hurry, get in the house.
I went with some of the Other men to investigate.
we found the wreckage,
a few wounded survivors.
we didn't know what they were.
we decided to take no chances.
we slaughtered them, Burned the bodies.
wise decision.
unfortunately We didn't get them all, and although None of us saw it,
evidently, One of them survived.
it took its first victim That very night.
we tried to hunt it down,
but we couldn't find it.
it's been out there ever since.
it feeds Three, four times a year.
takes two or three People each time.
two years after the crash, It took my own son.
that's it?
one wraith, in the forest?
Yes.
I'll be done by morning.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
we'll all go together, in the daylight.
you're really Going to help us?
well, like The man said,
it's just one Wraith.
it'd be downright unneighborly If we didn't.
in that case,
drinks are on me.
uh, well, let's not Forget the food.
what?
is it true?
you're going to Hunt the daimos?
it looks that way.
I heard It has two heads, and it can turn you to stone Just by looking at you.
well, You heard wrong.
my uncle says It'll come and take me
if I don't Do my chores.
he said that, huh?
well, then, If we get rid of it,
you've got nothing to worry about,
you'll never have to Do chores ever again.
Really? - yes. look, go away.
what?
as far as we know, No one was taken last night,
but it will strike, and soon.
we'll kill it Before that happens.
you must be great At parties.
we're talking about
a hundred square miles of forest here.
be patient.
ronon's been going up Against the wraith
one on one for the last Seven years.
if anyone can Track this thing,
it's him.
and exactly how is he going to do that, huh?
it helps to have Good hearing.
right.
carry on.
what about you? You sensing anything?
I'm not sure.
what do you mean?
there is A presence here...
but it is different.
I cannot quite Explain it.
it's in there.
damn it.
it's in there.
was it wraith? - yeah.
you see it? - no.
well, how do You know?
ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.
a female.
get out of the way.
no, please. Don't shoot.
she's not What you think.
she is my doughter
she means you No harm.
she's a wraith.
maybe so,
but she's different.
I swear to you.
let me guess-- Wraith with a heart of gold?
she doesn't Feed.
she's never taken A human life.
how is that possible?
please, lower your weapons, and I'll explain it to you.
it's all right.
father...
no, I won't let them hurt you.
I raised her as my own.
you live here, together?
this was part of a mine
before The last culling.
it's not much to look at, I know,
but we don't have Much choice.
the people of the village Would not understand.
gee, I wonder why.
the villagers Told us
there was a wraith in the forest.
it came here in a Crashed ship 10 years ago.
10 years ago?
ellia was just A child.
do you really think That she could be responsible for the deaths that happened Immediately after the crash?
so you know about that, then?
I was there.
I helped kill the survivors.
but when I found A young female
lying unconscious Some distance from the crash...
I couldn't bring myself to hurt her.
I brought her here to this cave to hide her from the others.
to this day,
the people of the village Don't know, and you must Promise not to tell them.
she's not responsible for what's been happening.
then who is?
I believe another wraith Survived the crash, an adult.
that's who You should be looking for.
if she does not feed,
how does she live?
at first,
I fed her as you would Any child, and that seemed to suffice,
but then something Began to change.
the food no longer Gave her any sustenance.
there was a hunger Growing in her
that would not be satisfied.
I heard the stories of the other creature,
what it did to survive, and I was afraid that was What ellia would become.
and so I...
started to experiment.
I have extensive Knowledge of the chemical properties of various medicinal plants
that grow in this forest.
are you interested in science?
I'm not sure that's what I would call this,
but yes.
Ellia's hunger was Growing stronger every day, and I wasn't sure
that I could do Anything for her,
but eventually...
I came up with this.
a drug that allows the wraith to survive without feeding?
that's what he said.
is such a thing even possible?
we don't know enough About wraith physiology to say for certain,
although, I must admit
it's intriguing That this dr. zaddik claims
the wraith survived On normal food for a time.
Why?
well, if he's Telling the truth,
it might be the answer to a very puzzling question.
right now, our best guess
is that the wraith evolved from the iratus bug.
like the one that attached Itself to my neck a year ago?
that's right.
I hate those bugs.
trust me, I know.
we've speculated
that they evolved into the wraith
when they began to take on The characteristics of the humans They were feeding on.
now, there are Many aspects of human physiology That are quite useful
bipedal motion, Opposable thumbs,
large brain capacity.
but the human Digestive system
serves no purpose in the adult wraith,
so why have one at all?
because they eat normal food When they're young.
exactly, Then at some point,
they lose the ability to sustain themselves with that food.
so it's a teenage thing
pimples, rebellion, Lifesucking.
something Like that.
the question is What causes it?
if it's due to some chemical deficiency,
like a diabetic's inability to process sugar,
then it's possible It may be addressed with some kind of drug.
so zaddik could be Telling the truth.
I'd like to go to the Planet and check into it.
is that really Necessary?
I'm sure we could Get a sample,
bring it back here for you to analyze.
it's not just the drug I'm interested in.
this young wraith could be Very important for our research.
what research?
we're working on a retrovirus That would alter wraith dna,
essentially Stripping out
the iratus bug elements of their genetic code and leaving only the human aspects behind.
a drug that turns wraith into humans?
effectively, Yes.
but so far, we haven't Had much success,
partly because we lack
the living tissue and blood Samples we need to test it.
you think this girl would be willing to provide them?
look, I realize we can't Bring her back to atlantis,
but I could take the retrovirus and the equipment necessary for the analysis with me to the planet.
a few days with a Cooperative test subject
could be worth months of theoretical research.
I don't have to tell you
how important this could be for us.
is she dangerous?
she's a wraith.
although...
I have to admit,
she does seem a little different.
remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground.
like this?
a little more.
now...
why is distillation an important step?
to remove the toxins from the ferassin root?
precisely.
we wouldn't want The serum to send you into Paralytic shock,
now, would we?
no, father.
seriously,
have you seen anything like this before?
no, I have not.
she is unlike any wraith I've ever encountered.
what if it's all an act?
if she were a killer,
why would he protect her?
well, maybe the act's for his benefit, too.
they live here together, rodney.
if she were like other wraith,
he would be her first victim.
Teyla, this is sheppard.
go ahead.
we just got back with beckett.
ronon's going to take him up to the cave.
I'm going to check in with the villagers.
what are you going to tell them?
I'm still Working on that.
this equipment's Remarkable.
where did you get it?
Oh, here and there.
let's start by analyzing That drug of yours, shall we?
Oh, yes. of course.
would you like Some tea?
Oh, thank you.
Oh, no, thank you.
would you like some?
no.
are you sure? It's very good.
I said no.
maybe some biscuits? I baked them myself.
stay away from me!
it's all right.
it's okay.
they hate me, don't they, father?
no. no, no, no.
they just don't know you.
was that really necessary?
you can dress her up and teach her table manners,
but it's not going to change who she is.
Teyla, This is sheppard.
go ahead, colonel.
is ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
has she been there The whole time?
Yes. why?
they just found another victim.
apparently he's only Been missing for a couple of hours,
which means she couldn't Have done it.
it looks like zaddik might have Been telling the truth
Colonel sheppard.
is there any progress with this hunt?
we're working on it.
maybe we could help you.
that won't be necessary.
we're sick of Doing nothing.
we're sick of being Afraid all the time.
that thing is hunting in daylight now.
we'll never be safe.
just be patient.
we'll take care of it.
you see?
I told you She wasn't responsible for the killings.
the serum makes it Unnecessary for her to feed.
can you Confirm that?
not yet.
it'll be a while before I can complete my analysis.
all right.
well, in the meantime,
there's another wraith Out there.
I believe ellia May be able to help us find it.
how?
may I speak with her?
all right.
may I join you?
ellia, we need your help.
you can sense the other wraith.
it is all right.
it is nothing to be ashamed of.
in fact, I have The same ability.
Really?
I sensed you in the forest,
when you were watching us, and I knew even then That you were different.
your father Has raised you well.
he has taught you Right from wrong.
you are not Like the other one.
I don't let him in.
I don't like what he shows me.
I know,
but you have to try.
now, we need to find him.
you don't understand.
I have tried myself, But I can get nothing.
please.
all right.
good.
now, concentrate.
try again.
I saw a river.
is there a river nearby?
Yes, just to the east.
all right, Let's go.
McKay, stay here and help beckett.
uh, medical research Is not really my thing.
and hunting wraith?
but, I mean, I can stay... and help beckett.
never could get into biology.
there's just Too much information
about the human body.
one time, I took it As an undergrad,
I diagnosed myself with half A dozen separate medical conditions
before I had to drop the class.
really.
Yeah, Believe it or not,
back then, I was a bit of a hypochondriac.
you know, This does require
a certain amount of concentration.
what, am I Bothering you?
maybe I'll go Get some air.
this must be the river She saw in her vision.
assuming She's telling the truth.
just because There's another wraith
doesn't necessarily mean You can trust her.
what do you got?
fresh tracks.
it's him.
now do you believe?
I still think there's Something more to this
than she and zaddik Are telling us.
he's heading Upstream, into the hills.
let me Ask you something.
if you can prove to everyone That I'm telling the truth,
that ellia no longer Needs to feed,
do you think the villagers Would accept her?
that's what I'm afraid of.
no matter how hard We try to convince them,
they'll always see her As a monster.
I'm getting old, doctor.
Oh, you've got lots of time.
never have as much As we think you have.
and when I'm gone, She'll be alone.
I tried to teach her About love and human companionship.
but that's exactly What she'll never have.
Zaddik, there's something I want to show you.
I didn't say Anything at first,
because I didn't want to get your hopes up.
it's a retrovirus,
something I've been working on.
I don't understand.
Oh, god. How am I going to explain this?
part of ellia Is human, and part of her Comes from a creature
we call the iratus bug.
it's the part that makes her Look the way she does and where her desire to feed Comes from.
now, it's possible, By means of this retrovirus,
we can strip away those parts, and leave only the human parts Behind.
you mean she-- She'd be like you and me?
Yes.
now, I must Warn you,
the retrovirus Is still experimental.
in fact, It's only been tested
on cell cultures in a laboratory, and so far, Without much success.
I'm hoping
that what we can learn from your daughter
will help me perfect it.
we've got a problem.
why didn't you Just radio me?
Yeah, well, I could've, but...
this way.
looks like they decided to join the hunt.
if they find ellia, They'll kill her.
Sheppard, This is mckay.
what is it, rodney?
the villagers Are on the move, and it doesn't look like They're going to a picnic.
are they heading for the caves?
not at the moment, no.
all right. Get back there and sit tight.
we're losing time, guys.
she's not here.
good lord.
what?
she took The retrovirus.
you said it wasn't ready.
it's not, Not by a long shot.
what'll it do to her?
to be honest I have no idea
Colonel sheppard come in.
go ahead.
we've got Another problem.
Ellia's gone, and she's injected herself with the retrovirus.
why would she do that?
she must've Overheard us
talking about it.
I told zaddik It might be the key to making her human.
please, you've got to find her Before the villagers do.
look, ronon says we're close.
if we lose the trail now, We may never catch the wraith.
Rodney and I Will find her.
all right, but be careful.
understood.
I'll come with you.
no, I think it's best If you stay here.
look, is there anywhere That she likes to go,
any favorite hiding spots Or favorite places?
Yes, she often goes off for hours at a time,
up into the hills.
I don't like it, But she doesn't listen to me.
it's a start.
you know, I thought It was pretty nuts
when ronon was trying to track a wraith
through this forest.
now that it's just us, Do you feel any better?
Oh, yeah.
supremely confident.
father.
where did you go?
I was hiding.
I didn't want The others to know...
to know what?
ellia, why did you Take the retrovirus?
because I don't want to be this way anymore.
I hate what I am.
if you heard What dr. beckett said,
you know the retrovirus Isn't ready.
I had no choice.
when they kill The other wraith,
I won't be able to pretend Anymore.
pretend? what?
I've wanted to tell you for a long time...
your serum Doesn't work, father.
it never has.
that's impossible.
it's been two years Since you...
since the last time.
that wasn't Your fault.
it was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the formula.
but it wasn't Working.
the hunger just...
got worse.
what did you do?
I'm sorry, father.
no.
no, that was the other one.
it was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
I knew when he was feeding, and I would go out At the same time.
no. no, it can't be.
stay away!
what is it?
what's happening?
let me help you.
No!
this is where He's been making camp.
he was here Less than hour ago.
did you hear Anything?
no.
huh. me neither.
easy, now.
you went through the trouble to save my life.
it'd be a shame to kill me.
you all right, Rodney?
Yeah, just peachy.
what the hell was that?
the retrovirus is having The opposite effect
than we intended.
I guess so.
Oh, god.
on the... yeah, but...
you poor girl.
you never deserved this.
I know part of you Is still there.
ellia, please.
this isn't you.
are you all right?
don't try to move.
it was ellia...
but it wasn't her fault.
over here!
here, come on!
no, no, no!
you people need to Go back to the village!
it is not safe here.
who is that?
don't you remember me?
no...
it can't be.
you were taken By the daimos.
no, father.
father?
I don't understand. You're...
you're his son?
if my son Were alive,
he'd be 34 years old.
there's another one of Those things out there.
look what it did to zaddik.
I say we go After it now!
no one's going anywhere.
we'll handle this.
stay calm.
how is he?
I've given him Something for the pain,
but his injuries Are too severe.
he's not Going to make it.
this can't be happening.
it's not possible.
I'm sorry.
don't blame ellia.
it was my idea.
you...
have to understand...
that when I found her,
I'd just lost My own wife and son to a fever.
she was just lying there, Helpless.
when I saw her, I knew what I had to do.
as I told you, in the beginning,
she survived on food and water Like any young girl.
no. no!
it's all right. Take what you need.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
she took what she needed from me to survive...
until I perfected the serum.
father?
father?
I'm so sorry.
she never fed On anyone after that?
no.
all right. teyla, ronon, You're with me.
the rest of you, Stay here.
Colonel, the retrovirus Is acting quickly.
the human part of her Is almost gone.
you said She killed the other wraith and saved mckay's life.
Yes, but I'm not sure She knew what she was doing.
she's operating on A purely animal level right now.
is there nothing You can do for her?
I might be able to reverse the effects,
if you bring her back alive,
but I doubt she'll cooperate.
she's also stronger and faster Than any wraith I've ever seen.
great.
all this time...
we thought you were dead.
there was no other way.
they never Would have accepted us...
and I couldn't abandon her.
Why?
she...
needed me.
Colonel, This is beckett.
go ahead.
Zaddik's dead.
understood.
she knows we're here.
she's watching us.
we want to help you.
Dr. beckett Can make you better,
but you have to come with us.
we will not hurt you.
die!
she took a blow to the Head when it hit her.
stay with her.
Sheppard - that's an order.
what happened?
Where's Colonel sheppard?
he went after The creature.
you let him go alone?
well, he wanted me to stay with you.
I am fine.
go.
aren't we supposed to follow His orders?
sometimes we are allowed to make exceptions.
who decides When it's one of those times?
we do.
that's good enough.
don't make me do this.
you okay?
Yeah.
she tried Feeding on me.
she wasn't going to Let us take her back.
Yeah. I know.
I've never seen so much nothing.
I've never walked so far to see it.
how was I to know the only structures on this planet would be in the immediate area around the stargate?
there's the gate.
dial it up.
wait. The energy readings here are exactly the same as they were a mile away.
I really think we should stay a while.
I thought you hated wearing these suits.
I do. I'm incredibly uncomfortable, but these energy readings are amazing.
it's like it's coming from all around us.
and yet you cannot explain it.
not yet.
you can't figure out a way we can use it?
not yet.
all right.
then let's call it a mission.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There is such a thing as pure science.
not everything has to be immediately useful.
you talked me into coming here because you thought those energy readings indicated the presence of a civilization.
there are no buildings, no people, no nothing.
just fog.
it's not technically fog.
there's no actual water vapor in the atmosphere.
I mean, for that matter,
I don't think we need to wear the hazmat gear.
now you tell me.
dial the gate.
let's move out.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
you wanted useful.
what are you talking about?
when the wormhole connected, there was a wild fluctuation in the energy field.
I mean, if I'm reading these numbers right, it looks like the gate is actually drawing power from the atmosphere.
so?
so?
to the best of my knowledge, this field goes on for miles.
I mean, for all we know, envelops the entire planet.
we're talking about a lot of energy here.
how much is a lot?
well, in terms of joules or ergs?
in terms of... lots.
well, lots and lots.
enough to open a wormhole back to Earth.
I thought the atlantis gate was the only one capable of dialing Earth.
it is, but that's because it's the only one with an additional control crystal that allows an eighth chevron to lock.
it's probably a security measure.
it doesn't matter.
as long as we have the control crystal,
I can make the other gate work.
you're suggesting we remove it from our DHD and bring it to M5S224?
Yes.
isn't that risky? - I'll be fine.
I think she means in terms of breaking our own gate.
I know what I'm doing.
besides, the control crystal is useless without enough power.
you said you didn't know where the energy was coming from.
I believe it is being generated somehow in the atmosphere itself.
the fog?
Yes.
you said it wasn't fog.
whatever it is.
well, how do you know?
I don't yet, but the fog, or the mist, or whatever you want to call it, is the only thing around for miles, and the energy readings were constant.
okay, even if you can pull this off, we have to assume that the Earth gate lacks a power source capable of establishing a wormhole back to Pegasus.
so whoever went, it'd be taking the risk that it might be a one-way trip.
I'm sure someone will volunteer.
you?
believe it or not, I would only go if I knew there was a good chance I could come back.
at least, we can send a message to Stargate Command.
let them know we're okay.
we've gathered a lot of intel.
we should send it... if we can.
even if it's over a radio.
that's it.
so how easy will it be to put that thing in the other DHD?
the atlantis' DHD is unique.
it's not like the'll be an empty slot waiting for us to plug it in.
Meaning?
meaning that there may be some disassembly required.
you want to take the DHD apart?
I'll put it back together again.
do you not run the risk of disabling the other Stargate?
only if I screw up, which is extremely unlikely.
840 years.
what?
that's how long it will take us to come get you by puddle jumper.
but you would do that, right?
of course we would.
well, it won't be necessary.
however, I may require some assistance.
major?
lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Atlantis, this is McKay.
go ahead.
we're ready to begin work on the DHD.
you're sure about this, Rodney?
positive. The next time you hear from us, we'll be delivering the good news.
good luck.
we'll be back in time for supper.
all right.
let's get started.
come in.
Hi. Do you have a moment?
Yeah, sure.
war and peace.
that's some heavy reading.
Yep, back on Earth, when I was getting ready for this mission, I realized there was a good chance that I might be here for a while, so I figured why not bring along a book that takes a while to read.
page 17.
I'm right on schedule.
that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about, home.
going home.
Oh.
McKay is right.
if this works, and we are able to establish a wormhole back to Earth
you know, if this conversation is going where I think it's headed, you can put your mind at rest.
I'm not going anywhere.
I haven't read my book.
look, all I'm saying is that you are the person who is best qualified to brief General Hammond and the other powers that be about the Wraith threat.
well, maybe so...
but I think I'm needed here.
good.
but if you want to go, I understand that, too.
what are you saying, I'm not needed here?
I said I'd understand.
well, thank you, but I made a commitment.
of course, in all fairness, life-sucking aliens weren't part of the brochure.
regardless, I'm staying.
good.
wouldn't be the same without you.
so if this works, would you want to go back?
I don't think it matters what I would want.
why not?
because Atlantis can't afford to lose me.
I'm their foremost expert in gate theory, wormhole physics, and a myriad of other sciences too numerous to mention yet too important to ignore.
I'd love to see my grandma.
she thinks I'm somewhere in afghanistan or something.
on the other hand, if anyone's going, it should be someone that commands the respect of the SGC and yet has the patience, knowledge, and determination to bring them up to speed and find a way to bring the cavalry back here.
so, what you're saying is you're invaluable everywhere.
granted, it would create a void if I were to go, but you can all take comfort in the knowledge that I'll be on the other side, spearheading the effort to return with reinforcements, fresh supplies, and big macs for all.
I feel better already.
Yeah, good.
major Sheppard!
have we heard back from Dr. McKay?
not yet.
word of the discovery has already spread throughout the base.
I've noticed.
it is to be expected, of course
faced with prospect of being reunited with loved ones, returning to familiar ground.
Yeah, I'd love to go back.
you would consider leaving Atlantis?
I just wish I knew I could gate back here.
then I'd go in a heartbeat.
it would be wonderful to see your world.
you could help me with the briefing.
I would like that.
Hey, you know more about the Pegasus galaxy than anyone.
then there's all those cool Earth things I've talked about, football, ferris wheels...
Oh!
do you remember the last of the popcorn we ate?
we can get more.
if we knew we could return.
unscheduled activation!
it's a radio transmission from Dr. McKay.
I'm done.
the component's installed in the DHD, and as you can see
well done.
sorry, what about the energy readings?
Oh, same as before.
all indications are that the gate's drawing power from the atmosphere, and there's enough for an eight-chevron lock.
okay, you stay put.
we're on our way. - Great.
so are we, uh, ready?
what's there to be ready for?
well, this is a big moment, and I thought we haven't been in contact for some time
we're ready. - Go ahead.
please work.
stargate command, this is Dr. Elizabeth Weir of the Atlantis expedition.
do you read?
I repeat, this is Dr. Weir.
come in, please.
this is sergeant Harriman of Stargate Command.
whoever you are, this better not be a joke.
no joke, sergeant.
I'm sending my personal IDC for confirmation.
sorry about that, Dr. Weir.
we're just a little surprised to be hearing from you.
understandable.
the iris is open.
you're clear to come through.
Thanks, but we're not ready to risk a one-way trip.
you don't understand, doctor.
things have changed around here.
the asgard are in the process of fitting Prometheus with engines capable of reaching other galaxies.
we were manning a mission to find out what happened to you.
is he serious?
are you serious?
es, ma'am.
come through now, and you could be back in Pegasus inside of a month.
well...
who's going?
welcome back to Earth.
and while the Pegasus galaxy does hold many dangers,
I feel its potential rewards justify the risk of maintaining a continued presence on the Atlantis base.
unfortunately, doctor, your preliminary report has given the Pentagon cause for concern.
if the Wraith are as powerful as you say, that would make them an enemy even more dangerous than the Goa'uld.
there are those who believe it would be prudent to cut our losses and abandon the Pegasus galaxy all together.
general, you can't
we are talking about a race that defeated the Ancients.
over its years in operation, Stargate Command has encountered a number of threats that could well have brought about the destruction of this world.
now, that never stopped you from continuing to send teams through the gate, General.
by the time SG-1 had returned from their first mission, the damage had already been done.
we'd alerted the Goa'uld to our presence and shutting down operations wouldn't have changed that.
in the case of the Wraith, however, we have a choice.
so we're just going to turn tail and run?
the Pentagon would prefer to call it "a strategic withdrawal.
but how can we be sure they won't come after us?
she's right, General.
they feed on human life forms, and now they know there's a smorgasbord waiting for them here.
I don't think we have a choice.
we need to continue to explore the opportunities for technological advancement Pegasus galaxy has to offer, not to mention our responsibility to the other humans who live there.
responsibility?
we did wake up the Wraith, and while, yes, that would've happened eventually without our interference, our access to ancient technology puts us in a unique position to help those people.
we can't just walk away.
rest assured your recommendation will be given consideration at the highest level.
general, sir!
thank you, sir.
major Sheppard.
I'm surprised the briefing went as quickly as it did.
you were very thorough, Major.
thank you, sir.
I thought you'd be enjoying some well-deserved R and R.
I was just going to arrange some transportation, sir.
consider it taken care of, Major. Anywhere you'd like.
well, that's very generous.
you've done your country a great service, son.
you deserve it.
thank you, sir.
well, how's our patient doing?
we're all done, Major. She's free to go.
I was afraid you had abandoned me.
just setting up our ride.
so... where are we going?
we should start by getting you a new outfit.
Hello, Simon.
Oh, my god.
when did you...
I missed you.
you have no new messages.
hmm, must've been a power failure or something.
anyways...
...there is nothing wrong with your television set.
do not attempt to adjust the picture.
we are controlling the transmission...
if we wish to make it louder, we will bring up the volume.
if we wish to make it softer, we will tune...
Hi.
Hi.
thank you, Major.
you're welcome.
I have traded in many market places on many worlds
countries. Countries...
Yes, of course. Countries...
but here there are so many different items to choose from.
Yeah, you seemed like you were having fun, hours... And hours of fun.
but you picked out a nice outfit.
thank you.
I wonder...
if we had never suffered the Wraith, would my people have created a civilization such as this?
I'm starting to wonder about a few things myself.
what?
nothing feels wrong to you?
I don't mean one thing.
I mean... everything.
I do not understand.
excuse me, uh...
could you take us to the Green Moss park area?
sure thing.
thank you.
I think I'll have a better idea of what's bothering me once we get there.
Hey, Sedge!
did you miss me?
did you miss me?
more than you can imagine.
I don't know how many times I watched that damn tape you left me.
I wanted to tell you in person.
no, you didn't.
you were afraid I'd talk you out of it.
I was afraid you'd try.
when you told me you were going away, but couldn't say where, my first guess was Korea.
my second guess was Israel.
to be honest, the Pegasus galaxy didn't make my list.
I am sorry.
I know.
I imagine my security clearance doesn't let you tell me what you've been doing while you were there
no.
or when you'll be leaving again?
no.
well, at the very least, you could promise me that...
you'll take this with you.
it's beautiful.
looks nice.
thank you.
is something wrong?
you know what? I'm sorry. It's just when you kissed me...
what are you talking about, Elizabeth?
Hello?
general. What
Yes, I understand.
thank you.
hang on!
Oh, hey.
just the middle of a power nap, and...
I'm not wearing any pants.
I didn't even think you knew where I lived.
air Force.
Oh, right.
Oh, look, I can't, um...
really, um...
I have a date with a girl in 302.
she's been taking care of the cat for the whole time I was away, and, apparently, she misses me...
Rodney... - I know, I'm trying to pawn off my cat off on a neighbor, and I end up with...
what?
I just got a call from General Hammond.
there was an accident on the Prometheus.
we can't go back to Atlantis.
I was going to come home, get some rest, then come back refreshed and ready to work on a solution, but an hour ago, it hit me, like Archimedes in the bathtub
Eureka! Except I wasn't in a bathtub.
I was on a couch watching a very strange outer limits episode...
forget Prometheus.
I've figured out how to establish a wormhole connection back to the Pegasus galaxy, but I'm going to need the ZPM.
the ZPM has been depleted. It's of no use. - Actually, that's not entirely true.
the last time we used it, the ZPM had to establish and maintain a wormhole back to Atlantis.
this time around, all we need for it to do is to have enough energy to establish the briefest of connections
by my calculations, approximately 3. 5 microseconds.
that hardly seems like enough time to accomplish-- - General, when we first set foot on M5S224, before the wormhole shut down, I picked up fluctuations in the energy field.
I just assumed that was an effect of the gate's residual energy signature, but having given it some thought, I realized that can't account for such sizable variances, which leaves only one possible explanation.
the gate must have been energized on our arrival, meaning it doesn't just draw power on outgoing wormholes, but on incoming wormholes as well.
all we have to do is make a connection.
3. 5 microseconds, that's the minimal amount of time it requires to confirm a lock before the gate automatically kicks in, drawing power from the atmosphere to maintain the wormhole.
you'll forgive me, doctor. This all seems a little farfetched.
think of it like making a long-distance call to someone you know is going to accept the charges.
all you have to do is dial.
I'm sorry, doctor.
well, you're not going to lose anything by letting me try, are you?
all I want to do is run a couple of tests.
all right. I'll have the ZPM delivered to the lab.
thank you.
Dr. Weir, I wasn't expecting to see you.
I've been thinking about what happened.
thank you.
I know it's a bit of a setback, but I don't think we should give up just yet.
if we can get the prometheus repaired
the prometheus was severely damaged.
we lost 20 crew members.
she won't be flying again any time soon.
so we ask the Asgard for one of their ships.
well, I'm sure that when the Asgard are in a position to help, they will.
general, I only came to Earth because I was assured I'd be able to get back.
now, I am not about to abandon my expedition team.
I'll see what I can do, but I'm not making any promises.
you've got to talk to somebody about this for me.
look, I'm sorry.
if those are the orders you received, it's out of my hands.
if there's one thing I can't abide, it's sloppy work.
if your people won't double-check their results, then there's no point in keeping them on the team.
Dr. McKay. - Yes, Lieutenant.
I'm being transferred.
Congratulations.
no, you don't understand.
I was chillin' with my parents, just having a good time, and some sergeant shows up with new orders for me.
I want to go back to Atlantis, and they want to ship me back to Antarctica.
lieutenant, do you know something that I don't, because the last time I checked, the Prometheus was critically damaged, and the only ZPM in our possession didn't have the power to run a car stereo.
I just thought you'd be trying to find another way.
there is no other way, Lieutenant.
you're just going to have to deal with it.
thank you.
would it be so bad if you had to stay?
I'm sorry, Simon.
I know none of this is fair to you.
it is tough to compete with the greatest adventure in human history.
I don't blame you for going.
thank you...
but I still feel guilty.
and now I feel guilty about being back.
because of the people you left behind?
no. I should have stayed at Atlantis.
major Sheppard should have been the one to go.
Oh, yeah.
just like I left it.
so much space for just one person.
well, a guy's got to have a lot of space.
I bet there's still...
perfect.
nice and cold.
and this is...
it's called beer.
is all this...
for recreation?
Yeah, I got pretty much everything you can imagine, don't I?
what is it?
I was just thinking again...
how Dr. Weir and everyone else on Atlantis...
of course.
I am sure she is fine.
as I am sure they are all fine.
Yeah.
I'm sure.
you people have those test results for me yet?
we need more time.
what are you talking about? Let me see what you've got.
wait a minute.
what is this, some kind of a joke?
I told you, we need more time.
these don't even make any sense.
we don't think the ZPM has enough power to open the wormhole.
well, you wouldn't know that from this, would you?
this might as well say, "bing, tiddle, tiddle, bong.
it's complete gibberish.
look, get out of here. I'll do it.
go.
you've got to be kidding me.
thank you for coming in again, Doctor.
has there been a response to my request?
actually, we won't be needing any help from the Asgard.
it turns out Dr. McKay has found a solution that will enable us to open a wormhole back to Pegasus.
he has?
why wasn't I informed?
doctor, the Atlantis mission has been reassessed.
what does that mean?
in light of the intelligence you brought us concerning the Wraith, it's been decided that the Atlantis presence should be military.
our allies have agreed to this?
they did.
as soon as Dr. McKay can establish a wormhole, we intend to send reinforcements, along with a new commanding officer.
I'm sorry, doctor, but you've been relieved of your duties.
okay, wait a minute.
I am not saying that there shouldn't be an increased military presence, but the mission must remain the same...
and I'm sure if Major Sheppard were here he'd tell you
we've spoken to Major Sheppard.
he dialed in about an hour ago to check on your progress.
we informed him of the situation, and he agrees with our assessment.
he wouldn't do that, General.
I know John Sheppard.
apparently, you don't know him as well as you thought, Doctor.
major Sheppard stated categorically it's the only way to ensure the security of the project.
let's get out of here.
Why?
you want to see Earth, right? It's out there.
I thought you would want to spend time in your home, visit with friends.
there is an idea.
Hey!
you didn't really think you could pass through town without seeing us, did you, Shep?
so you going to invite us in or what?
Yeah, sure. What the hell?
Hi. I'm Dex.
what is this?
is there a problem?
Rodney, I need to talk to you. - Can it wait?
no. Something is very wrong here.
I've run a diagnostic on the ZPM.
these are the results I keep getting back.
I'm not a scientist, Rodney.
neither is anyone else, or they'd have noticed the laws of physics seem to have flown out the window.
maybe there's a problem with your equipment.
I checked. It's fine.
look, if your solution doesn't work, it's not your fault.
we'll just have to accept the fact that we can't go back.
what?
so our boys were pinned down.
so hotshot takes his chopper over this bridge
and we were supposed to follow him.
well, there's no way I'm flying a blackhawk over a bridge with enemy tanks on it
wait, with what on it?
tanks. - You're welcome.
I still love that, man.
Yeah, that was, uh... priceless.
but, uh...
we got that special ops team out of there, didn't we, Shep?
Yes, we did.
I'll tell you what, that was some flying, Shep.
well, look who's in the pizza-delivery business.
no, sir.
I just caught the guy on the way up.
I was just thinking about you. Why don't you come in?
looks like we...
are having a party.
Thanks.
I've got pizza.
I've been relieved of my command.
Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
they're going to militarize Atlantis.
interesting.
well, it was bound to happen sooner or later.
what, so you're just okay with this?
Elizabeth, how did you expect them to react when you told them about the Wraith?
at the very least, I thought I'd be kept in the loop.
you're just being paranoid. Go spend time with Simon.
Yes, he's important to you, isn't he?
Yes.
I just don't remember ever telling you that.
well, how else would I have known?
we didn't know what to think.
I mean, this guy was supposedly one of the most ruthless warlords in afghanistan, and suddenly, he just sits down at our table.
sir, you got to hear this story
Yeah, I was there, Lieutenant...
Oh, yeah, you remember.
turns out he just wants to practice his english.
Shep spent half the night talking to this guy.
that was funny.
he wouldn't even let you get up to go to the bathroom, remember?
and two days later, you guys were killed outside Kabul.
let me see if I can make you understand, okay?
these results don't just say the ZPM won't work.
they say this reality isn't governed by any natural laws.
it's like looking through a microscope at a cell culture and seeing a thousand dancing hamsters!
it's impossible!
Rodney, you need to calm down.
no, no, what I need to do now is get very agitated, because what I'm realizing is that all of this is a lie.
this... And this...
and this!
what are you saying?
their chopper took an RPG when it touched down for a medevac.
there was barely enough left to bring back for a military funeral.
what?
you guys have been dead for years.
don't get me wrong, it's really nice seeing you...
and you too, Mrs. Watson.
sir, I don't... - She was my sixth grade teacher...
and...
I don't even remember your name, but I remember you wouldn't even date me!
Shep, I think we should take you to see a doctor.
Oh, really?
Yeah, you're acting pretty strange.
Oh, I'm acting strange, huh?
major!
now, do you see what I mean?
okay, the Rodney McKay I know would never accept the militarization of Atlantis without putting up a fight.
I don't think Major Sheppard would agree to it either.
at least not without speaking to me about it first.
Elizabeth, you shouldn't take it personally.
I mean, think of it like a blessing.
you have a life. You can get back to it now.
no. I'm not buying this anymore.
who are you really?
who am I? What do you mean?
you shot me!
you're already dead.
sir, give me the...
I'm beginning to have my doubts about you too, Lieutenant.
I wouldn't put them to a test.
now, somebody explain to me what the hell is going on here.
Dr. Weir.
okay, no more lies.
what is this? What's happening to me?
there's no point in deluding you any longer.
now you know.
Where's Rodney?
the real Dr. McKay and the rest of his team reside in their own illusory worlds.
I want to see them. Please.
what happened?
I drew you together from your fractured realities.
no, I'm talking about the beer I had.
major Sheppard discovered the truth some time ago.
he did?
home for the last 11 months, has been a research base in Antarctica.
although... I did dream about a bachelor pad like that, but
major Sheppard seemed uniquely capable of manipulating his own fabricated reality.
when I think of the scenarios I could've thought up, I'd kick myself.
the realities you experienced were fabrications of your own minds.
since you had no memories of Earth to draw from, you shared in Major Sheppard's illusion.
I thought that was you.
it is unfortunate that you all became aware so quickly.
hower, you may now create a fabricated reality of your own choosing in which to live out the remainder of your lives.
what?
that's not going to work for us.
I'm afraid the matter is beyond your control.
well...
we'll find a way to fight you.
that would be quite impossible, Major.
even now you are simply experiencing a shared fabrication.
it will be best if you try to make a life for yourselves.
this isn't life!
what do you want us to do, just pretend?
I'm sorry, but that's all I can offer you.
wait.
why would you do this?
to protect ourselves.
from us?
we did not intend to harm anyone.
unlike you, we exist in a non-corporeal form susceptible to the destructive effects of the Stargate on our home-world.
what destructive effects?
so the energy readings, they were life signs.
you were in the mist.
we are the mist, and every time the gate is activated, lives are lost.
over time, explorers have come and gone, completely unaware of our existence.
sacrifices are made to ensure our secrecy, but when you came back, we grew concerned.
to learn your intentions, we had no choice but to enter your minds.
when we discovered what you were about to do, we were forced to take preventive measures.
but you just said you'd let others come and go.
why not allow us to do the same?
your desire to return to your home-world was too strong.
the amount of energy required to gate to another galaxy would have killed millions of our kind.
so when we dialed the gate
you never dialed the gate. You just imagined you did.
you are unconscious, even now, on the planet's surface.
so none of this is real?
the cute brunette. Of course, I should've known. I mean, how do you go from...
you're a pig, but I like your cat" to "I missed you"?
we lacked a sophisticated understanding of your world.
as a result, the illusions we created from your thoughts were ultimately flawed.
the dead people were a dead giveaway.
dead people.
what were you doing?
if you had just told us, I mean, maybe we could... - Whoa, wait.
I just realized something.
you're saying that our unconscious bodies are still on the planet.
Yes.
Yeah, well, so we need food. We need water. I mean, we need food.
what he's saying is we won't live long in this state.
then I suggest you make the most of the time you have left.
you're killing us in order to save yourselves.
in order to save millions of our kind.
I believe you would do the same.
if we do not go back, our friends will come looking for us.
others of your kind?
they'll show up.
what are you going to do, kill them too?
and more will come.
one day, they'll figure out how to access the Gate.
then millions of your kind will die.
we don't leave people behind, and if you were really General Hammond, you'd know that.
but if you allow us to leave here, we promise we will never return, ever.
you will not have to fear us ever again. I give you my word.
how can you make such a promise when you so desire to return home?
sure, we'd like to go home.
we're not willing to kill millions of your kind to do it.
you've been in our heads. You're in our heads right now
you should know we mean that.
I understand.
I don't mean to sound negative, because that would be, you know, so not me...
but how do we know this isn't a double fake-out?
I mean, how do we know that this is
this is your reality.
you have my word.
I'm starving.
he's got to be right.
I wonder how long we've been out.
I need to get the control crystal out of the DHD. Shouldn't take more than a few minutes.
I'll give you a hand.
thank you for trusting us.
Rodney, be careful with that.
I want to make sure we can get back home.
you mean Atlantis?
I think that's what she meant.
how do I know she wasn't suggesting we pull a double fake and dial Earth?
forget the double fake.
get the damn crystal.
I'll do the dial-out.
ho! Ho! Ho!
it's been almost a year since I left my home in the East and traveled west with the man I loved.
I was positive about my future...
full of hopes and dreams.
our eyes were always on the end of the trail...
as if life as I envisioned it would be just that.
in fact, if someone had told me that I would find myself here today...
I would have called them crazy.
I was sure of myself and where I was headed...
stubborn and full of pride.
I was in control.
or so I thought.
quit acting like a kid, Marty. Get back here.
no. Not until you admit that I am right and head this way.
we're going in the right direction. - We're going north.
Mr. Graham said to go north.
he said to go northwest.
don't you think it's strange we haven't come upon it yet?
well, we'd be there already if the weight of these books hadn't slowed us down.
those books will provide us with a little culture once we get settled.
it's too bad we can't eat any of that culture.
that 200 pounds of beans and rice that we had to toss off the wagon to lessen the weight...
would taste a whole lot better right now than the 200 pounds of books we got!
none of this would have happened if you hadn't talked me into coming out here...
to the middle of nowhere, Aaron Claridge!
we both know that you don't do anything you don't want to do.
for once in your life, be reasonable.
I'm tired...
sick and tired of the dirt...
and miles that seem to lead nowhere...
and the layers of dust on my skin...
aching feet, aching back.
if I never sit in that wagon again, it'll be all right by me.
Marty.
I see.
it's exactly like I pictured.
can you see it? Just over there.
a cabin, with curtains in the windows.
and over here, a barn.
and a garden where we'll grow our own food.
those trees are just made for swings...
for all those kids who are gonna look just like their mama.
I don't mind if they look like their father.
we did it.
we actually did it, Marty.
this just feels right, doesn't it?
this will be the perfect place to raise a family.
pass down the land to our children...
and give them opportunities that are limitless.
we can do anything as long as we're together.
promise me...
that even if things get rough...
we'll remind each other of that, okay?
I promise.
dad blame it.
Marty.
one of the horses got away.
Oh, no, Aaron. - I'm taking the other horse, and I'm going after him.
shouldn't be gone too long. He's probably just a ways downstream.
I'm coming with you.
no need. I'll be back with the horse before breakfast.
make up a lot of pancakes. I'll be hungry.
got ya.
Hyah!
come on!
Hyah! Come on! Let's go!
Hyah!
come on. Come on. Let's go.
Hyah! Hyah!
Marty.
whoa. Whoa.
miss Claridge. Ben.
Ben Graham, ma'am. Met you a couple days back.
found him about an hour ago.
miss Claridge.
can I get you some water? Ma'am?
miss Claridge?
well, I guess you'll be needing time to...
to think, uh...
my wife will see to your husband.
the preacher's leaving tomorrow.
I can bring him back here first thing in the morning...
to say a few words.
Oh.
we're fine.
we're fine.
we're fine.
we're fine.
we're fine.
we're fine.
Hello?
Mrs. Claridge?
Marty?
it's me.
Sarah Graham, Ben's wife.
you met me a couple days ago.
Marty...
it's time.
we need to start your husband's funeral.
we don't want to be starting it without ya.
I can't do this.
you have to do this.
I would...
I would appreciate just... just a moment, please.
we'll wait.
aaron Claridge journeyed west in search of a dream.
his untimely death means that one journey is over.
another has just begun.
winter is coming, and there's no wagon train heading east till spring.
I don't know how you're fixed for money to board in town, but...
you're gonna have to make a decision... and soon.
well...
you take tonight and think on it, and...
Ben'll come and check on you tomorrow.
thank you.
excuse me, ma'am.
I'm Clark Davis...
and I'm truly sorry about your loss.
I have a proposition for you.
I know it's not the right place or the right time.
but I figure if we marry...
it'll help solve both our problems.
you'll have a roof over your head...
and all your needs will be met...
and my Missie, well, she'll have a mama.
I know it sounds crazy...
and the timing is unlikely...
but you have to understand the preacher's leaving the area today...
and he's not gonna be back until spring...
and I ask this only for my daughter.
I'm thinking...
that she needs a woman's hand in parts of her life.
I know it's not the perfect solution...
but when the wagon train heads back east in the spring...
I'll pay the passage so you can go home.
you'll help me get home?
if that's what you want.
I'll leave you to think on it, ma'am.
get her off of ya!
so I had to be chasing after 'em. The next thing... Hey!
I tried to stop them. - Hey! Hey!
Missie.
Hey, hey. Come here.
he started it, Pa.
you get up. Get up!
Clint says I got a new ma. He's lying to me.
is that true, Clint? - No, sir.
she poked me right in the nose for no good reason.
you're a liar. That is so a good reason.
Hey. Where do you think you're going?
apologize.
sorry.
sorry.
What'd I tell you about fighting with girls?
I ain't fighting with no girl. It's just Missie.
get inside. Go on.
no worries. - Come on, Missie.
we need to talk.
Oh, God, I don't want to do this.
I just wanna go home. - Now you listen to me.
there is no place in this part of the country...
to waste your time cying over wants.
your life's about needs now.
you need a roof over your head for the winter.
that's what you bargained for.
we are here today, gathered in the Lord's name...
to join this man and this woman in marriage.
please join hands.
will you, Clark Davis, take Marty Claridge to be your lawful wedded wife?
I will.
and will you, Marty Claridge...
take Clark Davis to be your husband?
come on now. Let's go.
just answer, "I will."
I will.
then I pronounce you man and wife.
buddy. Come here, Buddy.
I'll bring in your trunk.
this is the bedroom you and Missie will be sharing.
I'll get my things moved into the lean-to.
good mornin'.
saved you some ham. I'm...
I'm not much of a cook, but it's usually pretty fillin'.
I've never seen nobody sleep so long.
I thought you might be dead.
Missie.
go and wait for me in the wagon.
got some things I need to tend to.
I'll be taking Missie with me.
won't be back till supper.
ma'am.
she's sleeping again. - Mm-hmm.
let's go have our supper.
pa, is she all right?
no.
but she will be.
come on.
come on. Come on.
come on.
and bless this dear child in her time of grief...
and bless this food before us, and we thank you for the fine day ahead of us.
Amen.
you got an awful lot of pretty dresses.
it seems like you got an awful lot of fancy things that aren't good for much anything at all...
we fetched your wagon yesterday and brought it into the barn.
what are you gonna do with all them books?
I checked to see if there was any food that was spoiled when I was picking up your things.
we planned on buying supplies as soon as we found our land.
books must be pretty important to you.
I'll see if we can find space for them in the cabin.
I'm not sure what you're expecting from me.
come with me.
Missie's nine years old.
she works almost as hard as I do, sunup to sundown.
she never complains...
but the work is stealing her childhood.
she doesn't know what she's missing...
but I do.
maybe if somebody's there to share the chores...
she'd have time to learn some of the things I think you could teach her
things she'd learn from her mother.
and when I go home in the spring?
I figure I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.
the books.
how did you know they were mine and... and not Aaron's?
Oh, well, a man would have thrown them off the wagon at the first big hill...
unless he was tying to please a stubborn woman.
why are you here?
I thought you could use some help.
what would you like me to do?
you may need a place to stay, but I don't need a mother. Pa and me been doing fine.
I'm a little unsure about what to do.
why don't you show me how to get those eggs out from underneath their...
you know.
their rears?
spell "cow" .
K-A...
close. It's C-O-W.
Gertie don't care if I know how to spell "cow" or not.
Gertie doesn't care...
but I do and so does your pa.
so let's try another one.
spell "fun" .
F...
how do you spell "warm" ? - Warm? W-A-R-M.
I think you better W-A-R-M your hands.
what? - Well, how do you expect Gertie to give you good milk when you're freezing her like that?
probably spell "milking."
sure can't do it.
how'd you get to be so old without not knowing how to do nothing?
Oops. I really didn't mean to.
I know exactly what you're meaning to do, Missie. Now you listen to me.
you're not my mother, and I don't have to listen to you.
as long as I am here... - I don't want you here.
I've got news for you! I don't want to be here either...
but the fact of the matter is I made a bargain with your father...
and I intend to keep my end of that bargain even if you do everything short of trying to kill me in the process.
so the way I see it...
if I can survive traveling for months in a covered wagon...
losing my husband, marrying a complete stranger...
I can survive you.
so how was your day?
fine. - Yeah, fine.
I ran into Ben and Sarah Graham in town today, and they were asking after you.
that was kind of them.
actually, they invited us all to their annual get-together.
is it already time? - It is.
you see, the Grahams have a party, uh, this time of year...
so all the folks can get together before we're stuck inside for the winter.
we'd understand it if, you know, you weren't up for a party...
but it's up to you.
Yeah. You probably wouldn't like it. There's tons of people you won't know.
you'd probably just like staying home better...
don't you think, Pa? - I think I will go.
good.
what is it? - I just need to talk to you.
Missie's asleep, and I'm ready for bed. Can't we talk tomorrow?
well, that's just it. I won't be here tomorrow.
I'm, uh... I'm leaving before sunup.
I'm gonna help our neighbor. - Fine.
W... Wait. It...
what else?
I'll be leaving Missie here with you.
that is why I'm here.
Yeah, I... You know...
I just wasn't sure if you were up to dealing with a spirited...
I'm fine. Something else?
no. Ye... I'll be back by supper.
fine. Good night. - Good... night.
Missie.
Missie!
Missie, answer me. Where are you?
Missie?
Missie!
you better get out of here.
why don't you come down so we can get to work?
okay.
just as soon as he leaves.
he?
just come down slowly.
I've read that they won't spray unless they feel threatened.
you read that in one of your books?
Uh-huh.
and you believe it? - I do.
well, not me.
I'm starving, and I gotta use that outhouse something fierce...
but I'm not coming down.
buddy, no!
guess he felt threatened.
are you sure this is going to take the smell away?
more or less. Some of it's just gonna have to wear off.
the fire's dying. - Could you?
I ain't supposed to. I could burn myself.
something's burning
Oh, no.
Oh!
Oh, dad blame it!
Ouch! - Let me help you. Hold on.
hold on, hold on. Missie, get me some butter, would ya?
come on. Sit down. - It's fine.
no, you sit down here. I'm gonna wrap it up now.
here.
thank you.
it's nothing, really.
okay. Now this will just take some of the sting out.
pancakes are all burned.
here you go. Like that.
you know, you'll get the hang of that stove. It just takes a little practice. That's all.
so where'd the skunk find you?
the barn.
better get some more tomatoes, Pa.
took almost a whole bushel to get her smelling this good.
well, I'll see what we've got for supper in the icebox.
Missie, why don't you go ahead and stoke that fire?
I'll try to get all the things on your list for you while I'm in town.
you sure you don't want to go with us?
no.
she said she don't.
doesn't.
hope you can make something better than burned pancakes.
too bad I'll be gone, cause I can make some real good fried chicken.
I'm ready, Pa.
we'll see you soon.
how hard can it be?
if a child can do this, I can do this.
come here, chickie. Come here.
come here!
come here! Dad blame it!
pull feathers out with the grain.
you better be worth it.
huh.
looks like a coyote got in there.
more like a wild woman with an ax.
good. You're back. Supper's ready.
you made fried chicken.
good, cause I was getting awful sick of panc...
me too.
sure you won't want to have to wash all that.
I left half my things at home.
it's kind of wasteful, don't you think? - Wasteful?
to have so many. You can only wear one dress at a time.
surely you must have some dresses of your own.
one for when the reverend passes this way and holds a service...
but like I said, you can only wear one dress At a time.
my mama made beautiful quilts.
hers would put this here pattern to shame.
she made quilts for all the neighbors when they had their babies.
I'm sure they appreciated that.
folks loved my mama, especially my pa.
that's why his eyes ain't sparkly like they used to be.
she certainly was beautiful.
she was the prettiest thing you ever saw.
eveybody said so.
you must miss her vey much.
Oh, Lord.
I'm sory.
Oh!
Where's your father going? - On his Sunday walks.
it's his time to be alone and talk to the Lord.
I'll bet he has a lot to talk to him about this morning.
What'd you say? - I think I'll take a little walk of my own.
are you all right here by yourself?
I picked this dress because I know pink is your favorite color.
I love it when you wear pink, Mama.
you always look so pretty.
there.
letting in the sun will make you feel better.
I... I don't know why they didn't let me come here, Mama.
cause I would have sat here just like this...
and I wouldn't have made you tired or sad.
I just wanted to tell you that I love you...
and I miss you.
you were spying on me!
no. - You're lyin'.
I saw you. You were watching. How could you do that?
Missie, I didn't mean to be there...
but I do know what you're feeling.
don't say that. You don't know nothin'.
I do want to help you.
I don't want your help!
I hate it that you're here.
it was fine before you came.
I wish it was spring so you would leave.
I didn't mean to.
I... I was cold. I... I didn't mean to walk in on her like that.
well, I know what you mean. About last night, I... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to walk... - I don't know what I was thinking.
I can't stay here.
Why? - Why? That little girl hates me.
you were right.
she does need a mother...
but I'm not the right person.
she doesn't know it, but she's still grieving.
that's why you're the right person. - It's just not going well.
it's going just the way I thought it would.
I knew she wouldn't like it at first. - Then why put her through this?
because I love her...
and she needs more than I can give her.
seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through...
for just a few months of lessons in letters and sewing.
nothing's a waste of time. It adds to the person that you are...
and I'm counting on the fact...
that knowing you is gonna add to the person that Missie will become.
I know you can find a way to get through to her.
how do you know? - That's what I prayed for.
maybe I will.
we're ready.
you look beautiful, Missie.
Thanks, Pa.
whoa.
whoa.
gonna catch flies with your mouth hanging open like that.
when are you expecting?
february.
how did you know?
when Ellen was expecting Missie...
she'd hold onto her belly like you just did.
Oh.
I was going to tell you. The baby won't be a problem...
and I'm sure it won't change the fare for when I go home in the spring.
you must be thinking I should have told you.
actually, I was thinking I'm glad you're gonna have the little one...
to remember him by.
in the wa...
wa... Wa...
Wajon... Wagol...
keep trying to sound it out.
in the... wagon.
good.
I'm tired of trying.
it's too hard, and I don't need to read anyhow.
okay. Fine.
you don't care if I do it? - No, not if you don't like adventures.
reading ain't no adventure.
once you can read, you can have every adventure you ever dreamed of.
in the pages of a book, you are a princess in a tower...
or the best shot in the West.
in those pages, there are no limits...
to where you can go...
who you can be.
no one will ever tell you you're too young to slay the dragon...
because it all happens right here where it's safe.
I guess it wouldn't hurt none to practice a little bit more.
I'll be back. - Okay, Pa.
I think a walk will do me good as well.
Aaron.
pa!
winter's coming on with the subtlety of a snakebite.
it's a whiteout. - Where's Marty?
isn't she here? - She went walking about when you did.
if I'm not back here in 10 minutes, you use the gun.
you open the door, two hands, raise it above your head.
you keep firing until you see me.
all right?
what ever you do, you don't leave that door. Come here.
it's all right. It's gonna be fine.
gonna be fine. I'll be right back.
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
pa?
she's all right. Go back to sleep.
well, what about the baby? - The baby's fine.
okay? Go on and get some rest.
he should never have gone after that horse.
a man loses a horse, he goes after it.
it's as simple as that.
thank you, Father, for this food...
and this shelter and this companionship.
and as we come into the season of the birth of your son...
please make our hearts thankful that he came.
Amen.
I love Christmas.
and I already know what I'm gonna make you, Pa. - Is it something I can wear?
he's always tying to trick me into telling him...
but I'm smarter than that.
Yes. - So, what do you do to get ready for Christmas at your house?
well, about a week before Christmas...
we go to Franklin's and pick out a nice pine tree.
there's pine tree growin' in the city?
no. It's a tree lot. Someone has already cut them down.
you don't get to pick your own tree and...
see which one smells the best, which one looks the prettiest in the snow?
not exactly. But we find one we like...
then someone delivers it to us.
then we add to our ornament collection by going to Purcell's Store.
they have the most beautiful glass balls and red ribbons to put on the tree.
we make hot cocoa, drink it by the fire.
and then your pa reads you the Christmas stoy.
um, no. - Why not?
well, it just wasn't something that we did.
Christmas without a Christmas stoy.
well, when you get back, you have to tell him to read it to ya.
my father passed away a couple years ago.
what about your mama?
actually, she's... gone too.
so, who will you spend Christmas with when you get back home?
well, I used to have it with Aaron, of course.
I have an aunt that I'm close to...
and... and I have friends there...
you know, back home.
you can certainly have Christmas with your friends, can't you?
I mean, there's no hard, fast rule that it has to be with family.
well, you'll have your baby now.
you could spend Christmas with it...
Missie. Your supper's gettin' cold.
how about a little less talkin' and a little more eatin'?
anyway, the joy of the season is... It's a gift.
it's right there for everybody, right for the takin'.
doesn't matter where you spend it or who you spend it with.
one, two...
Yes, that's right.
merry Christmas, Pa. - Merry Christmas.
Thanks, Pa.
where is he who has been born the King of Jews?
for we have seen his star in the east...
and have come to worship him.
Marty? - Hmm.
Where'd this baby come from?
well, you know, from...
hasn't your pa ever told you?
no.
maybe you should ask him.
don't you know where your own baby come from?
came from. And, yes, of course I do.
well...
it's the same as you.
my husband Aaron loved me so much...
it spilled over and made a baby.
what spilled over? - It.
what's "it"? - The love.
I think that button is still loose. - Wow.
what? - I'm just thinking about...
all the brothers and sisters Clint has.
there's been a lot of love spilling over at the Grahams'.
indeed.
I wonder if my pa could ever feel that way about someone again.
he could, I guess.
give me your hand. Feel.
what's that?
that is someone who's getting pretty impatient to get out and meet you.
Marty?
I thought it was just back pain that I was having, but now I'm not so sure.
you're having regular pains?
just starting to. - Uh-huh.
I think it's time.
I'm gonna go get Missie.
there is no way I am letting you be my... my midwife. Find someone else!
there ain't no time for that. - Isn't!
and it's okay. I'll make time.
did you deliver Missie? - No, no. There was Sarah.
but Pa's delivered plenty of calves.
Oh, that's good. I feel so much better.
we're gonna need plenty of hot water. Run to the barn, get my shears.
we'll need to sterilize 'em. - Missie, don't you dare!
go on.
I would rather give birth in a field than have you in here!
birth is a... is a natural event, Marty.
Oh, you feel what I'm feeling and tell me how natural it is! Now, get out!
Oh, God, I can't do this alone.
please help me. Please, please help me!
push. You're doin' fine. You're doin' fine.
push. Push.
come on, push. You're doin' fine.
you're doin' fine, Marty. Come on.
it's a boy. Come here.
you were mooing louder than Gertie when her baby came out.
have you got a name?
aaron Luke.
aaron after his father, Luke after mine.
it's amazing, isn't it? - What's that?
this...
powerful love that just sweeps over you.
it's amazing.
weather's mighty temptin'.
I thought the fresh air might do us both some good.
Yeah. You warm enough? - Mmm.
he seems to be enjoyin' it.
Hey.
looks like we got company comin'. - Pa.
go ahead. You can do your chores later.
whoa. Whoa.
Hi, Clint. Let's go play.
whoa.
Howdy. - Ben, Sarah. Welcome.
you're lookin' a little more rested since the last time I paid a visit.
I can hardly believe he's already a month old. It just doesn't seem possible.
Yeah, they grow when you're not lookin'.
blink and you just might miss it.
that's what Clark said about Missie.
Clark understands and appreciates that.
he seems to be right fond of little Aaron.
I think he is.
I bet little Aaron has you thinkin' on his pa a lot lately, huh?
he would have been so happy and proud to have a son.
babies are a testament to love.
they're livin' proof of what you and your husband share together.
nobody can ever change that.
I still see Laura's dad every time her curls are bouncing in the wagon.
Ben had blond curls?
not Ben, Marty.
Laura's daddy.
he was my first husband. Thornton.
I was a widow. I had two little ones.
when I met Ben Graham, he had two young uns of his own.
I guess you might say we joined forces out of sheer need.
but, Sarah, I...
you and Ben, I just assumed you loved each other.
Oh, we do.
now.
I got more love in my heart for that man than anybody oughta be allowed.
I can't even tell you when it happened.
you know...
sometimes love isn't fireworks.
sometimes love just comes softly.
if you two are through gabbing, it's time we best be gettin' on.
I will come when I'm good and ready, Ben Graham.
that's fine, then. Can't say for sure if the buggy'll still be here when you're ready.
enjoy your pie.
Orney old goat.
Oh!
No! Clark, stop!
stop! Stop!
pa. Pa.
stop.
you got your laugh back.
I think I did.
aaron's cying.
Marty. Marty. - What?
the barn's on fire. Stay with the children.
please, God, if you're really there and listening to me, take care of Clark.
please let him come out all right.
please, God.
come on! Come on! Hyah!
Marty, what's happening?
Marty...
you realize you lost your wagon...
and all your possessions in the fire?
I know.
I made you a promise last fall, and I intend to keep it.
I'll be going into town soon to replace that feed.
and if you're wantin' to...
we could see about your way home.
we should put some ointment on your hands...
and wrap them so they won't get infected.
here's some coffee. - Thank you.
what are you going to do?
the neighbors have offered to collect some logs and raise a new barn.
Ben said he'd take care of the milk cow...
feed her in exchange for some milk until I get my feed built back up.
I think it's gonna be fine. Pretty much got it worked out.
just keep praying for answers.
why do you think he'll answer your prayers? - He always answers my prayers.
Really? Did you pray for this?
Marty...
did you pray to have Ellen taken away from you?
did you pray that little Missie would grow up never knowing her real mother?
I just don't understand why the god that you pray to...
would let such unthinkable things happen to decent people.
come with me.
where? What about the children?
Missie can watch Aaron for a little while.
where are we going? - Going to church.
Missie could fall down and hurt herself even if I'm walking right there beside her.
that doesn't mean that I allowed it to happen.
but she knows, with a father's unconditional love...
I'll pick her up and I'll carry her.
I'll try to heal her.
I'll cry when she cries.
and I'll rejoice when she is well.
in all the moments of my life...
God has been right there beside me.
the truth of God's love...
is not that he allows bad things to happen.
it's his promise that he'll be there with us when they do.
I'm gonna go back to the cabin.
do you wanna stay a while?
all right.
Missie...
would you do me a favor and get your pa's dirty clothes?
get. Would you get?
Yes, ma'am, I will.
Oh, Lord.
mornin'.
good morning.
smells good.
excuse me.
that wet winter we had sure did make the ground soft for plantin'.
I haven't seen you turn a page for 30 minutes.
I can't seem to concentrate.
I'm going over to the Grahams' tomorrow.
I'm gonna help Ben brand his new calves. You wanna come along and visit with Sarah?
I don't think so.
I should probably spend the day packing. It's about that time.
are you sure?
I'll let Missie know.
Missie, come here. - Okay, Pa.
I don't want her to go.
eveything seems to be in order.
you'll be leaving shortly.
would you?
I wish I didn't have to leave. - Then stay.
I just can't.
I want you to have my books.
and this.
my mother gave it to me.
I might be leaving...
but my love is staying here with you.
please say good-bye to Sarah and Ben for me.
I'll always be grateful that you were there that day.
I don't know what I would have done.
Bye.
Bye.
might as well get my things moved out of the lean-to.
okay.
father...
I don't know why you brought Marty into my life...
only to have her leave like this.
I know I don't always understand your plan...
but I ask you with a shattered heart...
please help me to accept it.
Amen.
Missie!
I'm going to bring Marty back. You don't leave the cabin. I'll be back as soon as I can.
Hyah! Hyah!
come on!
I'm glad to be leaving this god forsaken part of the country.
I wouldn't call it god forsaken.
horrible snowstorms.
beautiful sunsets. Rich soil.
a woman has to be crazy to stay.
crazy.
or in love.
Marty!
Marty! Marty!
Marty! Marty!
Marty!
what's going on? Who's Marty?
whoa, whoa.
Clark, what are you doing?
a man loses his woman, he goes after her. It's as simple as that.
I thought you wanted me to go.
I didn't see the note. - You didn't try to stop me.
until today.
don't leave.
stay with us.
stay with me. Please.
but... But I have to stay for the right reasons.
stay because I love you.
I... I love you.
or maybe...
I should stay because I love you.
that's a good reason too.
whoa.
mama.
come here, ride my back and we'll play. Come here, ride my back and we'll play.
love, love, love, my love. What a love, my beloved.
yes... my love. Oh... my love.

crawl like a baby. would like to see you crawl. Smile, for would like to see your inside.
then my love...
traditional music is good and all but how are we going to stand it for 5 hours?
l think there is a reason why we were told to watch it.
what reason? lt's the same old tale of Chunhyang
Hey, over here!
why are you so late? - l'm sorry.
don't laugh! Stop laughing You can't hide anything, can you?
Hey, isn't anyone going to buy the pamphlet? We're going to need it for the report.

l might fall asleep.
Hey, you have to be awake when l'm asleep and will stay awake when you are a sleep.

l'm tired and have a back pain. l can't take it for too long.

traditional art has never disappointed me. You should watch it.
just hang in there.
lt will take 5 hours to complete the performance.

l ask you to encourage me so can do my Job well.
from the beginning to the very end.
thank you.
Namwon town of Honam Province was known as Dae- bang region long ago.
on the east is Chiri Mountain. On the west is Chuksung River.
water flowed southwards with high mountains above.
full of spiritual energy,
Namwon bred many pretty people.
with endless graves of loyal officials, can unswerving loyalty not exist?
ln King SukJong's early reign, there lived the only son of a local governor.
he was 15 years old.
since he was handsome and righteous, he was a great man.
on one fine day, he called his servant PangJa...
hey PangJa! - Yes master.
l've been here several months, but l've yet to go sightseeing. Do you know of any good places?
why does a diligent student like you need to know?
you're foolish.
all the greatest scholars have visited famous sights.
so tell me now.
as you wish Master Lee. l will tell you outline
out the north gate, Kyoryong Fortress is a good place.
out the west is Sonwon Temple and to the east is Kwan Mausoleum.
to the south is OJak Bridge, and YongJu Pavilion.
they say they're the best places to visit in the south provinces.
from what you said Kwangharu seems the best.
go get the horse ready.
but your father forbids this and we'll get into trouble.
l'll Just get permission.
go mount the saddle!
he mounted the horse, and PangJa leads the way.
as he leaves the South Gate, a fan shaped like a crane's yellow wing, he flips it open and blocks the sun.
as he travels down the South Road, the breezy dust from each trot, flutters in the air with the scent of peach flowers...
the governor's son is out.
Juksung Mountain in the morning is still covered by late fog.
the river water reflects green willows and flowering trees.
the spring wind blows gently.
the beautiful columns soar high into the sky.
the purplish- red tower embraces the sunligh and shines radiantly.
must be Kwangharu.
Kwangharu is beautiful, but OJak bridge is better.
lf it is really OJak bridge, then the legend of Gyunwoo and his love Jiknya must be true.
l'll be the Gyunwoo star on OJak bridge, but who shall be my Jiknya?
PangJa. - Yes, master.
today, we'll drink as friends not as master and servant.
who is the oldest of you two?
master, he's a few years older.
then you have a drink first.
take this drink. Today's your day.
lt's really great " l didn't recognize spring's arrival. "
'but everywhere, peach flowers blossomed already. "
'a pair of butterflies left the peach flower, but they returned missing it. "
white and red flowers. White and red flowers from the flowery forest an angelic girl appears.
like the sun or moon, this beautiful girl appears.
she arrives in a forest for have a swing with a girl about her age.
the long twisted ropes, she grabs them with her delicate hands.
she leans once, and swings up.
she leans again, and swings back.
lf she flies higher, she'll meet the Sowangmo angel.
lf she flies lower, she'll meet the ancient YoJi empress.
she is a girl, but also an angel.
one moment she's far away, the next she's very close.
her swings in and out are like a swallow's springs
her lovely motions put Mongryong in a spell.
Hey, PangJa. - Yes... Yes, master.
look over there. - Where?
where my fan is pointed idiot.
Oh, the wrestling match we passed by.
look carefully.
can't you see that girl swinging in the forest?
looks like a fair maiden on a swing. Let's go inside...
you think a fair maiden would be out here on a swing?
you fool. You should even recognize a passing dog in your hometown.
Oh, her name's Chunhyang. She's an old courtesan's daughter.
looks like her maid Hyangdan is with her too.
a courtesan's daughter... This is good.
PangJa. Go and bring her here.
please can't... - PangJa!
she won't come.
even though her mother's a courtesan Chunhyang is arrogant,
so refuse become a courtesan do weaving and sewing well- read, and writes poems. She's like a noble's daughter.
she's a courtesan's daughter. So can't ask to see her face?
bring her to me now.
Oh master... Many officials, penniless rakes, and even nobles of Namwon tried endlessly to seduce her, but they all failed.
that's nonsense.
the world's precious beauties are destined to have an owner.
so go and get her.
PangJa obeys and runs for Chunhyang.
a fast, chic, and charming PangJa.
yet a flippant, fluttery, and sly PangJa.
like a blue bird delivering a letter to Sowangmo, a clever and quite cunning PangJa.
he wears an ox felt hat with silk straps, a fake Jacket and linen pants.
with a stick for a pipe, and the front end of his garment tied to his back, he takes one step, and takes another.
step, step, step, step away.
he breaks a branch, and plays around with his staff.
cross here and there
he picks up a stone, and throws it at a willow tree to scare the birds away.
after his childish play, ln front of proposing Chunhyang he runs to the forest swing and yells as loud as he can...
... Chunhyang!
Oh gosh! You fool! My lady almost had a baby on the swing!
what? A baby? Can you believe it? A virgin gave birth!
l meant she almost fell, you idiot.
Chunhyang, there's a big problem.
what is it?
the governor's son came to visit Kwangharu. He saw you on the swing, and wants to meet you. So let's go.
how come the governor's son is interested to meet me?
Chunhyang is this... Chunhyang is that...
pangja, you must've squealed everything about me.
Chunhyang. lf you're a fair lady then you should've swung in your front or backyard.
tie a rope to your tree and make your own swing.
but in this open field you flaunt your bare ankles, ease us with your raised dress pretty smile, and giddy laugh,
so no wonder he fell for you.
let's go!
l may be a lowly person but l'm not a courtesan.
so as a fair lady, you can't Just drag me to any man. So go alone.
Chunhyang, wait! Do you want to get into serious trouble?
the governor will torture you for being rude to his son. ls that what you want?
well, PangJa, How can a flower call a butterfly
then tell him this. " The wild geese desire the sea the crabs desire their holes, and a butterfly desires a flower. "
you idiot! l didn't tell you to chase her away.
l didn't do such a thing.
she cursed me in words l didn't understand.
and told me to repeat them to you.
what words?
she said, " the wild geese desires flowers... " ... or was it the other way.
Really? They're not insults but a proverb with deep meaning.
like the wild geese desire the sea the crabs their holes, and a butterfly's flower, " The wild geese desire the sea the crabs desire their holes, and a butterfly desires a flower. " she wants me to go to her place.
let's go.
now?
my father granted half a day so we've got to go back.
studying in nature is one of the scholar's ways, but you're forgetting to balance your body and mind.
don't forget to follow the 'six exercises of a scholar,'
such as archery and horseback riding. Don't forget to do these things.
lf you get sleepy reading old classics read this book to stay awake.
young Lee sits at his desk under Chunhyang's spell.
he sees the six officials and PangJa, and it's Chunhyang.
his mother, and it's Chunhyang. And his father, it's Chunhyang.
shapes of the 'Gwon'... the shape of a sphere, a cube Chunhyang's shape, my shape, the shape of lovers...
they sleep together, and make a baby's shape.
master Lee, what kind of book is that?
the Book of Changes'. - No, it's the 'Book of Lovers'.
