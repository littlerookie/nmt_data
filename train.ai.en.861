and you're welcome to stay a few days and do just that before you go back to school.
God, this whole night just felt like a bad Fellini film.
Ooh, 21-hour drive.
want to take the first shift?
what now?
I'll see you Monday. - What?
I'm gonna stay, Just for a couple days.
we got two more days before break ends, and...
I know that it's hard to explain.
I just...
you need to see for yourself.
I get it.
I saw your face, Claire.
the way you looked at them...
like you belonged...
like you knew them.
God, I've never had that feeling anywhere in my whole life.
I'm happy for you.
I'll see you Monday.
I hope so.
I'll make this right, Lydia.
it'll all make sense soon, Joseph, the gathering of the others, all of it.
you've gone to great lengths to bring her here.
she is awfully innocent.
I'm not sure she's going to serve a purpose for you.
it's not her I'm after.
my brother Joseph had the right idea.
he believed that alone, this family would be safe.
and that idea has worked for us for years.
but how long can we live like this, wandering in the desert without a home?
times change, and we need to change with them.
we need to stop running, stop living in the shadows.
we should be stronger. The problem is,
there's simply too few of us to make a stand.
if we are truly to be great, we need to grow our ranks, bring in new members.
and the newest among us cannot be shackled with the same burden we've borne,
wandering like nomads.
they deserve a home...
a promised land.
now, I've thought a lot about exactly where this homeland should be.
and I keep coming back to this very spot.
here we will plant roots and build a life, a community.
here we will be oppressed no longer.
here we will live our lives on our own terms.
but none of that can happen until we have gathered the rest.
and when we have done that, we will return to this place.
we will wander no longer.
we will finally be home.
to be
it can bring people to you, like a siren's song.
compass?
that seems to be the key component in the mystery, enough for them to kill for.
he's gonna tell me everything he knows about the carnival.
we could isolate samuel here.
the problem, of course, is finding it.
but our primary focus must be stopping samuel.
first, you have to disappear for eight more weeks.
well, then we'll have to agree to disagree, hiro.
the craziness over the last few weeks is finally over.
Sylar's gone.
who is she?
Vanessa. the love of my life.
have you seen her around here?
she's out there.
I'm afraid she'll reject me for who i am, for what i've done.
you're still her father.
you're the only one she has left and she needs you.
you know, the thing about burnt bridges is they can be rebuilt.
look at her.
how do i explain to her about the world without dampening her spirits?
now she sees it filled with promise and hope, as bright as the light in her eyes.
but i've lived long enough to know that everything is not as it appears.
evil does exist.
people do terrible things to one another.
Oh, god. oh, my god!
Noah? noah? oh, my god.
I'm still your brother.
how do i protect her without losing her?
hasn't your father lied, cheated, even killed, to protect you?
how do i build a bridge between us... - you lied to me.
we shouldn't have done it.
...when the distance seems so vast?
I need time to grieve without being reminded why.
so much for his eighth grade class.
who's next?
we're getting down to childhood playmates, noah.
if that's what it takes.
all i'm saying is, are you sure this is a productive use of our time?
Yes.
I've got to find this guy, lauren.
and i want to help you. but we've been shooting in the dark for, like, six hours now.
you got a better idea, i'm all ears.
it's just that you're starting to sound a little... - obsessed?
you could call claire.
not an option. - she has a compass, noah.
she can lead us right to the-- i am not calling claire.
she's angry at me right now, and frankly, she has every reason to be.
she's in no mood to help her old man.
well, maybe it's time to patch things up. - maybe it's time we found a useful lead.
if you don't want to help me, you don't have to.
I'm--I'm...
we got a hit on vanessa wheeler.
who? - she's the one that i told you about.
she grew up in the estate where his parents worked.
the house that became a sinkhole.
looks like we have some still photos off a security camera.
is that your man?
that's him. you got a phone number?
california area code.
Hello?
Vanessa wheeler? - yes? who's calling?
my name is bennet. noah bennet.
I wanted to talk to you about samuel sullivan.
what's this about?
just looking for him, and i'm wondering if you've heard from him lately.
I'm sorry. i don't know anybody by that name.
Really?
because he grew up on the estate that your family owned.
looks like i'm going to california.
Yeah. good luck with that.
good night.
just writing a letter.
anybody i know?
I'm running low on ink supplies.
if you're going into town tomorrow, i need you to pick some things up.
of course.
I know much has happened lately that's difficult.
Edgar. hiro claire bennet. joseph.
not to mention sylar.
I'm asking for your patience. i need you on my side.
we're so close now to realizing all our dreams.
our dreams, samuel? or are they yours?
I made a list. indigo. umber. linseed oil.
- don't worry. you'll meet her soon enough.
I've waited a long, long time to bring her.
the day has finally come.
you don't trust him, do you?
he's planning something big, and i don't like it.
he's always been good to me.
I don't know why you want to cause trouble.
if this family is going to survive, we are going to need a new leader.
like who?
there is someone. a man of compassion.
samuel himself said that he may be the next joseph.
he's just so far away.
well, maybe you can call him.
maybe i can.
is matty still asleep?
Yeah. he was up so late watching ratatouille.
speaking of which... hmm?
tonight, for dinner-ratatouille.
Really? - yeah. i'm looking at it.
I mean, it's really not that hard.
you know, my brother called yesterday.
he's still looking to hire someone. you don't know of anyone, do you?
uh, no. i mean, i told you before, i don't know any software salesmen.
you see, he doesn't need a computer guy.
just someone who's smart, focused and, you know, looking to get ahead.
you don't like my cooking?
Matt, i love your cooking.
but you want me to work for your brother. seriously?
honey, your brother?
I'm just worried about you.
since you got back, you hardly leave the house.
well, i'm a stay-at-home dad guy.
that's what i do. what's wrong with that?
nothing.
I just want you to be happy.
there's "stay at home because you want to," and then there's "stay at home because you're scared not to,
and i just don't know which one you are.
I'm the one who is really excited about this ratatouille recipe, which, by the way, will be ready at 6: 30 p. m. sharp.
honey, i'm really happy. i am, just being here, taking care of you and matty.
okay. - have a good day.
go make some money, will you?
Hello, matt.
I thought i'd check your security system. seems you're not as safe as you think.
okay. - i've left you five messages.
what do you want, bennet?
I need your help.
have you ever heard of a guy named samuel sullivan?
no, but even if i have, the last time i helped you, i got sylar stuck in my head and i almost died, you remember that?
it's nasty out there, matt.
but shoving your head in the sand doesn't make the world go away.
Yeah. well, you never know until you try, do you?
I'm sorry about what you've been through.
the sylar thing was a terrible idea. we all admit that.
look, i stay home and lock my doors.
I don't see why that has to change.
because this sullivan guy, he's a very bad man.
well, so is bin laden. so you're gonna have to do better than that.
he's trying to recruit my daughter.
okay, what's your plan?
are you gonna go kick this guy in the teeth instead of talking to your daughter?
I'm sorry.
today it's claire. tomorrow, it could be your son.
all right, time to kiss bye-bye.
patients only past the double doors.
can't i at least see him to his room, make sure he's comfortable?
comfortable.
come on, pal. let's get you strapped in.
what? - just an expression.
Hiro?
Dr. watson is suresh!
how long are these rehearsals anyway?
I have no idea.
okay, so she plays the cello, she's in the l. a. chamber orchestra, and she's first chair.
what is she, samuel's girlfriend or something?
well, that's what you're here for, matt.
that's her, right there.
Yep. looks like rehearsal's over. jump in anytime.
what? no, no, no. hey, i never
do i know you? - i'm noah bennet.
we spoke on the phone briefly. i called you about samuel sullivan.
I thought i was clear.
I told you, i don't know him.
Yeah, the problem is that we know that you do because we have pictures of the two of you.
are you with the police?
no. it's more complicated than that.
is there somewhere that we could go and sit down and talk for a minute?
look, whoever you are, just, please leave me alone.
hang on just a second.
have you met my friend matt parkman?
No! and i don't want to!
Matt, you want to share any thoughts here, please?
no, i told you i
you can trust us, vanessa.
you want to talk to us.
you know, come to think of it, i'm glad you called.
I need to talk to someone.
I'm worried about him.
Hey, noah, it's peter.
look, that, uh-that tattoo on my arm, it showed up again.
give me a call, all right? bye.
Yes!
it worked!
I'm sorry. what worked?
I brought you here with music.
I just had to think of you, and it worked.
I'm sorry.
please, come in.
I met an unusual man, and he showed me a new side to my ability, using this.
where did you get this cello?
that same man. he's the one who sent it to me.
who? what's his name?
Samuel. why?
I woke up this morning with this.
they were good years, growing up.
he used to write me these poems, these little love poems.
we were close.
neither of us cared that his family lived in the carriage house on my family's property or that his father called my father "sir.
one day i came home and they were gone.
I moved on with my life.
I assumed he moved on with his.
but he hadn't.
he showed up in my room one night, all swagger and rock and roll.
I was just in the right place for the bad boyfriend.
we had a wild couple of weeks, till he asked me to marry him and run off to his carnival.
I mean, a carnival?
I was getting a music degree at yale.
Vanessa, he's not that 20-year-old kid anymore.
samuel sullivan is a very dangerous man.
well, lately he has been showing up more and more often.
since his brother died, it's gotten even worse.
he just shows up, spouting all kinds of crazy things.
okay. so he's stalking you?
that's not the word i would choose, but he does seem-- obsessed?
a week ago, he was waiting for me in the lobby of my apartment building.
going on and on about how much he misses me, how we'll be together once i see how powerful he's become.
it was 2: 00 in the morning.
so he knows where you live and you know how to reach him?
I've been banging my head against the wall, trying to figure out how to find the carnival.
maybe we bring the carnival to us.
okay. how do you move a carnival?
do us a favor.
call him.
is this the guy that gave you the cello?
who said his name was samuel?
Yes. you know him?
he told me his name was william hooper.
what did he want from you?
he didn't want anything.
just to find a homeless man.
that's it? - yes.
he gave me something.
this.
Emma, the last time i saw a compass like this, my friend got stabbed.
you think samuel-- if there's any connection to that, i'd keep my distance from him.
Peter, he's a good man.
Emma, my friend almost died because of a compass just like that.
and he wasn't the first person that got attacked.
Delmonico's for lunch.
or maybe it'll be too crowded.
how about moxie?
Hi, mom.
um, emma, this is my mother, angela.
nice to meet you.
mom, this is emma. - peter, how do you know this woman?
Emma is my friend.
I need to get to work.
Bye, peter.
I'll call you later.
what the hell was that?
x y z a b c d e f g h how's it going?
all good.
you better not be messing with my meds.
no, i was just admiring your cart.
very nice. i work in a cart factory.
you're the japanese guy's friend.
uh, yes.
I'm buck.
excuse me.
I'm chuck.
Yeah. well, take it easy.
he's late.
we're pretty exposed here, noah.
so when he shows, we've got to hustle.
taser and some duct tape and we're out in 60 seconds.
you getting a hit on the chip in her pocket?
Yeah, it's all good.
we have our target.
what?
well, he didn't come past me.
he must have come around the back.
and let's go. copy that.
Hello, bennet.
Hey, can i ask you a question?
no, uh...
Hey, what was that?
the alley. get the car!
got it.
where is she?
stay away from her, bennet.
where is she?
what the hell happened to you?
all right, she's headed south on normandie. let's go.
you had a dream.
there's nothing you can do to save her.
you need to save yourself.
I'm sorry.
mom, half this family is dead.
their bodies are surrounded with lies.
it's down to you and me.
are we ever gonna get this right?
please, just tell me the truth.
for once in your life, mom, please.
the dream was foggy.
the message was not.
she's gonna help kill people.
that's wrong. mom, that's not possible, okay?
she's a good person.
Peter, she's gonna kill thousands of people.
it will be a bloodbath.
a cello. something to do with a cello.
tell me exactly what you saw.
I told you, it doesn't matter.
the important thing is that you cannot save her.
but someone else can. is that it?
I'm sorry. i need to know.
people think that dreaming the future is a gift.
they're wrong.
Dr. watson!
Dr. watson!
Hiro?
Dr. watson, i have traveled over great oceans to free you!
where am i?
you put me here!
to be continued.
beware the stormtroopers!
why are you talking like that, hiro?
warp speed, dr. watson.
we must rescue sancho and escape.
Sancho?
the prisoners have all gone to dinner.
I've hidden sancho for his safety.
Ando?
what's happened to him?
he partook of the absinthe intended for you, dr. watson.
perfect.
one who can't walk, one who can't talk.
they must have searched my cell.
we've got to go.
we shall ride to freedom.
what's happening?
it's like swimming but inside out.
silencio!
I'm swimming!
warp speed, captain!
get back in your cages!
stormtroopers!
there they are!
it's okay. i've got this.
what the--?
she's here. she's right here!
the carnival was here.
yeah? well, it isn't here now.
they had, like, a two-minute lead on us.
an entire carnival doesn't just disappear.
this one does.
well, how did claire find it?
gotta have a compass.
okay, so you're saying she got that from the samuel guy?
no. she got it from me.
great. okay, well, then let's go back to claire then.
it's not gonna work that way.
you're burning bridges, noah.
you can't talk to claire anymore, so tell me, how is it gonna work then?
I don't know! i don't know.
but we're gonna find it.
somehow.
we have to.
Lauren, it's me. just call me.
I'm running out of ideas here.
well, you know what? i would love to sit and brainstorm with you.
I really would. but i've got to make dinner.
dinner? yeah. ratatouille.
what? ratatouille. it's french. it's in the book.
I know what ratatouille is. this woman's been kidnapped.
well, that's a missing persons case.
and we have to find her.
I don't have a badge anymore. let the cops handle it.
you're gonna send cops up against specials?
they're gonna get flayed alive.
look, i dragged her into this.
I pulled her into the sunlight.
well, maybe she's already crossed state lines, noah.
look, i mean, admit it. this is bigger than us.
so what are you gonna do?
are you just gonna lock your doors and crawl back into your shell?
you're one of the good guys, matt.
you have a responsibility. you're not a coward.
you know, some days maybe you just can't save the whole world.
some days, you're better off just getting your own house in order.
which means what?
which means... go home.
hug your little girl.
don't worry.
I've come to save you.
what are you doing? - i'm sorry.
what is wrong with you? - let me explain.
I have these dreams that come true, and i had one about you and that cello.
you broke my cello because you had a dream?
no. because a lot of people are gonna die, emma.
your friend, samuel.
uh, that compass that you have. my tattoo.
they're all connected to this cello.
I loved that cello!
and we have to make sure to stop that dream from happening.
that's why i broke the cello, okay?
something bad is going to happen.
I want you out. now!
I'm sorry. i...
good-bye, peter.
okay, i think that way is west.
we must away, before the stormtroopers are upon us.
I have had just about enough of your nonsense, hiro.
after what you did to me, i have half a mind to leave you lost in this swamp forever.
Hey, don't talk to him like that.
Hiro has got very little time left, and he chose to spend it rescuing you.
you should be thankful. he's a hero.
what do you mean,"little time"?
the reaper waits for no man.
he's dying.
the stormtroopers and their ewoks! hurry!
are you sure he can't teleport?
no. not unless we unscramble his brain.
Hey, what would they have done at that hospital?
probably electroshock therapy.
Hiro! why are we stopping?
electroshock therapy.
what, you want me to
even if we evade them, we could be wandering out here for days.
we need to teleport out of here.
how?
you can use your red lightning.
look, hiro once saw a future where i killed him with my red lightning.
was it in florida?
japan.
then we're good to go.
make it so, sancho.
Hiro!
Ando.
Dr. suresh.
we must stop samuel sullivan!
Hiro, you're back!
Yes. and now, we must get going.
dad?
Hey, um, i'm sorry to bother you.
I was just in the neighborhood.
Really?
ye--no, no. i was in california.
I just landed. bags are still in the car.
listen, i know that you're mad at me and--and i'm okay with that.
and, um, i want to just let you be mad at me.
I don't want to try to talk you out of anything or to try to convince you of anything.
dad, what are you doing here?
are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, i'm good.
I'm--I'm great, actually.
I'm just--i'm thinking about bridges.
bridges?
bridges that connect us to the people and things that we love and need in our lives.
they're built on trust, and i've-- i've torched most of them.
and i'm just hoping that the
that the one that connects me to you can still be repaired.
I'm sorry, but i do have something that i'm late for.
Oh, okay.
can we talk about this later? - yeah, yeah.
we'll--we'll-- we'll talk about it later.
this thing that you're late for, do you need a lift?
no. no, i'm good.
okay.
so i'll, uh, i'll see you later?
Yeah. um, i'll see you later.
I didn't think a law office could be such a soap opera.
I mean, the human drama of it all.
Matt, you remember my boss, pressman?
so he's totally gay, he's totally in denial, and he's totally married.
okay.
Matt, this is delicious.
so how about you?
did you, uh, leave the house at all today?
do you think i'm a coward?
what?
I think i'm a coward.
what are you talking about? why?
I had the worst guy in the world living inside my head.
when i finally got rid of him, i didn't do a thing to go after him.
because you came home to us, where you belong.
I've let so many people down.
who?
friends. um, people that i care about.
I mean, i'm sitting here, eating ratatouille, instead of facing the world, doing something about the problems that i've caused.
Matt, you have a family.
come on, you're a simple guy.
you care about us. that's your world.
you just have to let the rest of it be.
there is nothing cowardly about looking after your family.
you belong here with us. okay?
Yeah.
come here.
not exactly five-star accommodations, i know, but if there's anything you need...
what i need is to go home, samuel.
what are you doing?
you can't just take me.
I've thought about this day for so long, vanessa.
the day you would arrive.
it wasn't supposed to be like this.
everything was supposed to be perfect.
I don't know what you're talking about.
he did a real number on you, didn't he?
he got into your head.
I had to act, to protect you, to get you away from him.
by kidnapping me?
I would hardly say that.
you won't let me leave here.
you've got me against my will.
what would you call it?
you know what? i'm just
you're upset. and i understand why.
but there is a reason for all of this.
there's something i want you to see.
it's so magical, so beautiful.
just let me show you, that's all.
if you're still unhappy, i'll take you right back to california, i promise.
what do you mean,"right back to california," sam? where are we?
it's so beautiful, vanessa.
wait till you see it. it's perfect.
I was driving by. i saw the light on.
come on in.
how was california?
not as fruitful as i would have liked.
you got my messages?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. - i know.
and i think i, um...
I care for you more than i want to admit.
and it's complicated.
I know.
just don't do it again.
you have company.
sorry to pop in like this.
got your power.
isn't that interesting?
I know why you can't kill.
Hiro Nakamura said you're going to die alone, and it's haunting you.
we all need people who understand us.
care for us. - Who's she?
the love of my life.
he just shows up. - And he's stalking you?
he does seem... - Obsessed?
I had to act, to protect you, to get you away from him.
by kidnapping me?
you can never cheat the past.
it's bad, always!
everything is connected.
if you wanna change one thing, that's all you do.
I must go back and un-do the wrongs...
I have committed in my life.
I've come back in time to save Charlie.
and this time, I will defeat the brain man.
he's not crazy.
he has a brain tumor.
and I think it's getting worse.
there's something I want you to see.
it's so magical, so beautiful.
just let me show you, that's all.
if you're still unhappy, I'll take you right back to California.
did they really think that they were gonna get away with it?
forever?
that we would just never find out?
we shouldn't have done it.
I need time to grieve without being reminded why.
do you wanna talk about it?
about what?
life among the Carnies, the death of your father...I mean, either one of those would be enough to mess me up.
I don't think I'd know where to start.
I just...think it's one of those things I have to figure out by myself.
listen.
I'm not gonna pretend to know what you're going through right now.
but I want you to know that I'm here for you.
if you need anything. Anything at all.
I have this review lesson thing.
I moved it to Bapst Hall, I have no idea where that is.
east quad. Clear across campus.
of course it is.
excuse me. Is this seat taken?
Noah Bennet's apartment Washington. D.C
you sure you're feeling okay?
you don't look too good.
I'm fine just thirsty, thanks.
are you okay?
Yes, thanks.
how's it coming?
it's ready.
chapter Fifteen "Passifall"
now remember， It'll only work in the hands of one of us.
luckily, you have Hiro and Ando now.
you sure I can't change your mind?
I broke a promise to a girl.
I need to make amends.
well, then I guess this is it.
in our lives, when is it ever?
Thanks, Mohinder.
good luck.
you too, Noah.
well, gentlemen, I guess it's up to us.
Hello, Carp.
but you are dead.
am I dead?
that's for the judge to decide.
judge? - All rise.
the honorable judge Kaito Nakamura presiding.
father?
be seated.
what is the case before us?
the world versus Hiro Nakamura, your honor.
the what versus what?
you are accused of breaking the hero's code, willfully altering the timeline for personal gain.
if found guilty, the crime is punishable by death.
excuse me, is this professor Yanno's review session?
Nope. Study group.
ready to brainstorm?
what the hell are you doing here?
I came to learn.
how'd you sleep?
the dress is a gift.
if you want to change into something a gift?
you kidnapped me, brought me to...
I don't even know where we are because you won't tell me.
you're right, I'm sorry.
I never meant to upset you.
I'll take you back home. Straight away.
what? What are you smiling about?
your face. Just now...
it brought me back to when I broke your record player.
you had this one song, you played over, and over, and over.
and I was just-- I was just kidding around but I broke the arm. -Remember?
Yes. I remember.
good.
cause there's something I still want you to see.
the only thing I'm interested in seeing is my own front door.
but first, let me get you something to eat.
and then you'll be rid of me for good, I promise.
this is how it always starts.
breakfast becomes lunch, lunch becomes dinner, dinner turns into drinks, and then...
I fixed your record player.
I broke it and then I fixed it.
I know what I've done wrong, and I know how to make it good.
with scotch tape, and wire hangers, and loads of good intentions.
fine.
something to eat.
then you take me home.
good. Great.
he has a brain tumorin the parietal lobe.
the doctors in japan said it's inoperable, but we may not have a choice.
please, doctor, he's my best friend.
I can't just-- - wait here.
we'll find out what's happening.
please help him.
it is our intent to prove that the defendant abused his power to bend space and time selfishly and repeatedly for his own personal gain.
and with a blatant disregard for the consequences on the space-time continuum.
how does the defendant plead?
plead?
what's going on, father?
you may address me as "Your Honor."
you're dead...
this is some bad dream or tumor hallucination.
let the record show that the defendant fails to recognize the authority of this court.
this isn't a court, it's a diner.
perhaps your honor could enter a plea for the defendant if he refuses?
I plead not guilty.
do I get a lawyer?
even in a diner...
I'm entitled to a lawer, right?
of course.
Ando？
Hey!
punishable by death?
Mr. Monroe, please call your first witness.
I know it doesn't look good.
the prosecution calls Kimiko Nakamura.
but don't worry.
and Masahashi has your back.
and Ando Masahashi.
you know how much I would love to kill you?
listen...
I know you must hate me.
you killed my father!
it seems like a lifetime ago.
but I'm a little off my game.
you're gonna help me get it back.
says who?
says this.
your face showing up in ink wasn't my choice.
it's destiny showing me my desire.
and you actually thought that I would...
relax.
they told me I needed connection.
a friend.
I don't want to be alone.
and somehow you're supposed to help me.
I wouldn't help you if my life depended on it.
it's not your life you should be concerned about.
let's get this over with.
you don't have to hurt Gretchen.
I promise that you will see her again, just as soon as you help me answer my question.
here is what I've been thinking.
you and me.
we got a lot in common.
we're both adopted...abandoned by parents who didn't want us.
and raised by parents who didn't understand us.
my parents understand me just fine.
stop lying to yourself.
both of our dads were cold-blooded killers.
which is ironic, because you and I...cannot be killed.
I get it.
okay, we have a few arbitrary things in common.
what is your point?
my point is they're not arbitrary.
they're formative.
the basic building blocks of our lives,
and we have the same blocks.
yet, here we are...
content college co-ed, and me.
how did we end up so different?
you want to know what the difference is?
you're a psychopath.
mystery solved.
you think this is a game?
this is my life.
you're supposed to help me.
or don't you care how many filets I slice your roommate into...?
if you're not gonna contribute, I'll just have to take the answers from your head.
you're gonna slice my head open again?
I've evolved way beyond that.
my friend Lydia gave me a much more precise instrument.
she could read someone just by touching them.
see into the very depths of their soul.
of course, her methods were a little hyper-erotic, but...
Ah, what the hell.
it is college, isn't it?
the dress suits you.
what's that?
a strawberry milkshake.
your favorite.
well...
that was a long time ago.
how about this one?
the last time I crashed in your dorm room, we talked all night.
among other things.
we talked about your dream home.
that was the tequila talking.
a peaceful cottage surrounded by nature and happiness.
you're such a romantic.
actually, that's something I've admired about you.
but there comes a time when you have to realize that you're never gonna have that cottage.
says who?
can you honestly tell me you don't you look back at our time together with a hint of fondness?
what's your prognosis?
not good.
tell me about that day at the Canival, Mr. Masahashi.
and what happened to the "slushy" in question?
it slipped out of my hands...and it hit a strange old man.
and is that man in the courtroom today?
the witness has identified Hiro Nakamura, who's clearly and selfishly interfered with the timeline.
I object!
on what grounds?
your honor.
he helped two people fall in love.
if anything it's a selfless act.
is that true, Hiro?
Yes.
two people found love, and no one was harmed.
where is the crime in that?
just so I'm clear...on your personal scale of temporal justice, it's okay, so long as no one gets hurt?
Yes.
that is my definition.
that's good to know.
because I believe my next witness is here.
just tell me where she is.
you've been holding out on me.
what are you talking about?
why I was supposed to find you, you and I are the same.
I am nothing like you.
you do exactly what I do.
you use this...gift, this curse, whatever it is, to build walls.
make it impossible to actually connect with another person.
like Gretchen.
God, all those memory hits I got from your stuff, while I was tying her up...
have such a different context now.
everything in that room is so full of...
pauses.
what did you say?
pauses.
all these moments so ripe with subtext.
can I borrow your book?
cut my hand with these scissors.
all these interactions, and you still can't say the one thing you really want to say to this girl.
heck...
you keep this up, you might end up alone forever too.
you don't know what you're talking about.
I think I do.
the indestructible girl who can't put herself out there to get hurt.
what? No angry retort?
you're right, you are off your game.
you just told me exactly where she is.
how many people have I killed?
hundreds, I suppose.
and all of this because of an agreement you made with the defendant?
Yep.
he told me if I saved the waitress I could have the cheerleader, and anybody else I wanted to kill.
and as long as you saved his girlfriend, you could kill some more.
willy-nilly. - Willy-nilly.
seems to me that a lot of people were hurt as a result of Mr. Nakamura's time tampering.
I object!
I was trying to save Charlie...without changing space-time!
silence, Mr. Nakamura!
your honor， my client was trying to do what was right!
Really? Does this look right to you?
who is that?
the cheerleader that Sylar killed.
crap!
tell me again, who else met their death by your hand after Hiro made this deal?
well, there was her.
and Eden...Ish.
the melty guy, the mechanic,Isaac Mendez, my mother,
some guy named Ted something--Ted...
and so on, and so on.
if Hiro was acting out of an ability, perhaps he should have stopped this vicious killer before these countless murders-- - Sprague!
so saving Charlie wasn't for the heroic good.
it was for the good of Hiro.
no.
romantic or not, Charlie was a good person!
one more outburst...
or what?
Charlies was special.
the world was better because she was in it.
I believe that, I stand by it.
fair enough.
then the prosecution would like to call its final witness.
Oh, that's right.
I've forgotten we can't bring Charlie in
because this world-improving person is lost in time.
now tell me, how did that happen again?
I made a deal with a...
I'm sorry. You'll have to speak up.
I made a deal with a villain, and he double-crossed me.
right.
prosecution rests, your honor.
a shake roof, wraparound porch, and a stone path leading to a lake where the sun glistens over the water.
how'd you remember all of that?
I have my ways.
I know all the details.
by heart, it would seem.
hard to forget.
I was holding you close to me, and the way you painted it, it made it so real, like it came from your soul.
like...like it was you.
you always know the right thing to say.
you have the perfect scrap of poetry in your pocket to...
to what?
with a big oak tree in the yard, surrounded by wildflowers.
and a couple of rocking chairs on the deck To watch the sun set.
you do remember.
with a fireplace to keep us warm, and a summer breeze to keep us cool.
how do you do it?
Every...single...time.
this is so beautiful.
how did you do it?
my friends and I can do the most amazing things.
look. There's your dream cottage.
no more traveling now.
we'll make it a home. A real home.
for me, for you. If you'll have me.
Oh...Sam!
you said you couldn't join a Carnival.
and now you don't have to.
there's no more carriage homes, no more main homes, just...just that.
away from everything.
it's what you talked about.
it could be our life.
I can't live here.
but you said...
I know, I know, I know, I know what I said.
it's just...
it's just, I didn't think you'd actually
actually do it? - Yeah.
but...I mean...
this dress, and the milkshake, and...
all of this, this is a fantasy.
and I made it come true.
for you.
no, Sam.
for you.
this is your fantasy.
and it's-- it's beautiful.
and I'm happy for you.
but it isn't me.
my life isn't here.
but I changed everything for...
no, don't tell me you did all this for me.
please, don't.
don't tell me this was all for me.
no, of course not.
listen, um, I should get you back home.
thank you for indulging me.
no, Sam.
no, it was really...
it was really nice to see you again.
are you okay?
I'm fine. All things considered.
I'm so sorry, this is all my fault.
you never should've gotten caught up in it.
I'm just-- I'm happy you're here.
and that it's over.
it is over, isn't it?
no. He's not done.
somewhere out in the open?
no, he'll be expecting that, he's trying to flush us out.
how do you know?
cause apparently I get the way he thinks.
someone's coming! - In here.
so Sylar, huh? The Sylar?
Yes. Well, no.
kind of the emo-apologist version.
he's had me trying to figure out what his issues are.
Seriously?
how'd that go?
pencil in the eye.
listen, I'm sorry.
it's okay.
getting used to being all perils of pauline.
no, not about that. Well, yes, about that.
but...
about breakfast.
about sometimes keeping you at arm's length.
it's cool. Are you kidding?
if you don't want to-- - I do want to.
I just--I'm scared.
and I get afraid that I'm gonna get hurt, and so I use my specialness to build these walls, Instead of, you know, jumping off bridges.
I suck at metaphors, but what I'm trying to say is that-- - It's okay, really.
no. No, it's not.
this guy, Sylar, he sat there and told me That we're very much alike, and he's not wrong.
and I'm afraid that I'm gonna end up alone for the rest of my life like him.
and I don't know how to fix it.
do you want to talk about it?
I like to think of myself as Just a girl who happens to have powers.
and it's just one thing in a list of attributes, loyal, friendly, regenerative, good skin, you know?
you do have good skin.
but when you put the chips down and life gets tough, I hide behind that one label, that one attribute.
and I close myself off.
man, no wonder Sylar's so messed up.
I can only imagine what having a bunch of excuses could do to someone's humanity.
maybe that's his answer.
in order to become human again, he has to get rid of all of his powers.
Yeah, maybe.
now was that so hard?
you son of a bitch.
where is she?
it's dinnertime.
I imagine she's right where you left her.
you never took her?
like I said, I've been having a little trouble being myself.
you're okay!
of course I'm okay.
well, some guy stole my backpack, but what's with you?
nothing, I'm fine. And then you're here.
and you're all right. - Claire.
you're acting really weird. - I'm sorry.
I'm really lucky to have you.
and I'm sorry about this morning.
forget it.
you know me, impulsive Gretchen wants to hold hands so she does it.
I know. And I love that about you.
and I wanna be more like that, and not be be holden to any label, or definition, or who I'm supposed to be.
I just, I wanna hold your hand.
people are gonna start to talk.
let them talk.
talking's good.
in fact, I could use some talking If you still have a sympathetic ear.
I, in fact, have two ears.
come on.
Mr. Masahashi, please call your first witness.
Mr. Masahashi
the defense calls...
Hiro Nakamura to the stand.
what?
have you seen "Law &Order"?
that always backfires.
you have any better witnesses sitting around?
because I don't.
Mr. Nakamura, how long have you known the defendant?
Seriously?
all my life.
and what has been the driving force motivating you? This whole life.
to be a hero, noble and true.
and when you discovered your ability.
did you rob banks?
or become famous?
no, I promised to only use if for good.
and how has that worked out so far?
I saved the world.
twice.
and did you break your code doing so?
no.
and did you even break it to save your own murdered father?
no. I did not.
so what changed？
I was weak.
and desperate. For a meaningful legacy.
so you found your self a victim of the bad man's con?
I did.
and I found myself leaping from life to life, striving to put right what once went wrong..
objection, your honor!
he's reciting the opening to "Quantum Leap."
please warp it up, Mr. Nakamura.
.Yes, I used poor judgement.
but despite the sometimes disastrous effects, it was to make the world a better place...
for family.
and friendship.
and love.
and if breaking my code for those things makes me guilty...
then, I suppose I'm guilty.
so be it.
we need to shock him.
give him 200 joules.
charging.
guilty.
clear!
no response.
240. - Bring it up.
charging. Clear!
still nothing. Start compression.
we're losing him.
no, Hiro.
still no pulse, we're losing him.
let's shock him again.
charging. Clear.
I want to change my plea.
to "Guilty."
if this is the end, then I want to go out with honor.
doing the right thing. I want to go our a hero.
go my son, flight for your honor.
not so fast, Carp.
fight.
you can beat this.
the Hiro I know never gives up.
he does whatever it takes.
I've seen him bend the very fabric of time and space.
you are super-Hiro.
mother.
I've missed you so much.
as have I, son. As have I.
and I'm so proud of you for all the lessons yo've learned.
the tumor.
I thought I could fight it,
that I could beat science...
but I can't.
mother, I'm ready to go.
no, Hiro.
some things are more powerful than science.
like destiny.
so... you havn't come to take me?
no.
I've come to heal you.
we got a pulse.
he's coming back.
he's rising.
is something wrong, sir?
Yes, something is wrong.
am I scaring you?
do I look scary?
sir, I just wanted to know if
you don't think I can see how you're looking at me right now?
that I'm different?
looking down your nose at me?
like I'm not good enough!
I'm done trying to change myself for you, trying to fit into your world, play by your rules.
from now on, you're gonna play by mine.
can I help you?
Hey. Hey, buddy.
how are you?
I'm sorry, I'm Gabriel.
a friend of Matt's, 12th Precinct.
Oh, I'm sorry, he's not here right now.
is there any way that you could tell me where he is?
it's really important that I speak with him.
sure.
I'm sorry, have we met?
wait a second. Is that Claire?
Hello, claire. - Samuel wants to surrender.
Really? Why? - To protect his family.
he's willing to turn himself over As long as the rest of the carnival
stays safe and under the grid.
I found him on the hill... With this!
Peter, she's gonna kill thousands of people.
it will be a bloodbath.
tell me exactly what you saw.
you cannot save her.
but someone else can.
don't worry.
I'm here to save you.
he's trapped, peter.
what the hell did you do? - I went inside his head,
and I trapped him in his worst nightmare.
he'll never hurt anyone again.
I have to bring him back. - No. No, you can't do that.
you go into his head, you might not come out.
Peter-peter, don't! Peter! No, peter!
Hello! Hello! hello!
Hello? Hello!
is that really you?
I came to get you out of here.
it is you, isn't it?
I thought I was alone here, that everyone was dead.
what are you doing here?
I came to drag your sorry ass out of here.
now, let's go.
there is no getting out of here, peter.
I've tried...
for three years. - Three years?
what are you talking about? It's been three hours.
wait a minute.
you're not...
really here. You're not real.
it's just my mind, isn't it?
this is my mind playing tricks on me As part of my punishment, isn't it?
you think I'm gonna let you taunt me?
you stay away.
if you follow me, I will kill you! Do you understand me?
I swear I'll kill you. Get out of my head.
calm down. I'm telling you the truth.
I came to take you out of here.
why do you keep saying that?
I went to parkman's house to look for you.
he put you here. This is a dream.
no, it's not a dream!
this is real.
you really don't understand That this is all just a nightmare?
hell, yes, it's a nightmare
three years, completely alone.
not years, hours.
all right? Parkman trapped you here.
Parkman? That's impossible. - Is it?
what's the last thing you remember Before coming here?
I remember...
wanting my life to change,
thinking I was gonna spend all of eternity alone.
exactly. And here you are.
look, I've got parkman's ability.
I can take you out of here.
why would you want to do that?
the brother of the man I murdered coming to my aid?
because I need you to help me.
look, I could leave you here to rot, But I need you to save her,
my friend emma.
in the dream, you save her Before she kills thousands of people.
no. You got the wrong guy. I'm not the savior kind,
and you should know that better than anybody.
it's gonna happen, and you're gonna save her.
fine.
you really think you can get us out of here?
let me see you try.
go ahead.
see?
we're not going anywhere.
we're trapped here, forever.
we got to do something with her.
that we will, eli.
if you'll excuse me.
I want to see my father.
he's safe, unharmed,
which is more than he deserves After shooting into a crowd of innocent people.
my dad didn't shoot anyone. If he had, you would be dead.
you're not that naive, are you, claire?
your father came to this carnival with a gun, Intent on using it.
isn't that why you tried to negotiate my surrender,
because you were afraid he was gonna do something like this?
no. I want to see my father now!
your devotion to your father is touching,
but you're blinded by it.
it's time for you to open your eyes
and see your father for who he really is.
I know who he is, And nothing you say to me is gonna change that.
of course not. That's why I'm gonna show you.
dad! - Claire.
thank god you're all right.
untie him.
not quite yet. Damien.
Damien has the ability to reveal a person's memories.
it's fairly painless if you don't fight it.
you think showing me my dad's memories Is gonna enlighten me?
you deserve to know the truth.
let her go, samuel. You don't need her anymore.
you afraid she'll see the real you, bennet?
don't do this.
take a peek, claire.
see where it all began.
all right, now, this one has it all
white walls, wire wheel covers, Wood grain, everything.
the kids'll love it.
well, what's the payment look like?
$150 a month.
I know, that's, uh - that's kind of steep, right? Look, um...
you didn't hear this from me,
but you guys should go to val's discount motors On la cienega.
get the same model, maybe a year older, Probably half of what you'll pay here.
Thanks. Really appreciate that.
Bob, pick up line one.
Bob, you have a call on line one.
guess who?
um, let me see. Soft, lovely hands, Long, supple fingers.
I don't know-candy?
candy? - Oh, I'm in trouble.
it's my wife.
what are you doing here? - I just thought I'd come by,
see how the world's most handsome salesman Is doing.
well, if I see him, I'll ask him.
Me...Not so good.
I stink at this job. I have no killer instinct.
you don't belong here.
you should be home writing plays
somebody has to pay the rent. - Who needs money?
we can live on love. - Wouldn't that be nice?
what's going on? Is something wrong?
I hope not.
it's just I have some, uh, unexpected news.
and promise me you won't get mad.
Kate... What is it?
I'm pregnant.
I know-I know we didn't plan this,
and you always want to be the man with the plan, but...
you're happy?
of course I'm happy! I'm gonna be a father!
you had another wife and family?
I'm sorry I never told you.
no.
it doesn't matter.
let him go.
you're not the least bit curious About what happened to your father's first wife?
no.
no, it's his business. If he wanted me to know
there are reasons He kept it secret from you, claire. Isn't that right?
let her go.
you got what you wanted, someone to blame-me.
look at the fear in his eyes.
he knows what's coming.
I'll leave you with damien.
I think you'll find it very informative, claire.
don't do this, you son of a bitch!
did you order pot stickers?
double order - you're eating for two now.
Oh! Can you believe this? You and me-parents.
what's it gonna be like?
I have no idea.
but I can't wait to find out.
the moo shu has arrived. - Mm. Go. Go.
delivery. - Uh, what happened to mr. Yin? He usually delivers.
Yeah, he - he couldn't make it.
okay, so, uh, how much do I owe you?
all of it. - Aah!
Noah! - I can't move.
what did you do? - Where's the rest of the money?
how did you do that? - Kate, give him your purse.
this is it? - That's all we've got.
take it and go. - What are you?
Aah! No!
Kate... Oh, my god.
Kate. No.
no. No. No.
no. Kate.
give it up, man.
can't go forever without talking to me.
I mean, you've gone a month. That's impressive.
there isn't anybody out there.
there never will be.
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life here, Alone, with you.
it isn't exactly heaven for me either.
here. I know you like comics. I couldn't find doc savage or flash
what the hell is wrong with you?
you need to stop messing around and focus.
focus, right? 'cause we got to get out of here So we can go rescue...
what's her name again?
her name's emma.
it's time to face reality, peter. That girl is gone,
and if she was meant to kill thousands, They're dead too.
everybody's dead except us.
the only thing that's real is us.
you think you've been here for years, But this is all just a dream.
if this is all a dream, how are there books, huh?
how did parkman make books? - Because it's your dream.
how could I possibly know all the words To pillars of the earth or catch-22?
I don't know, maybe you read it somewhere, And it's in your subconscious.
Yeah, well, I didn't read 9th wonders!
I did. - So now we're in your head?
I don't know! I don't know how this all works!
don't you want to get out of here?
Yeah, of course!
you don't, do you?
you don't want to get out of here.
look, maybe I deserve all this aloneness...
this nothing - maybe I earned it.
Yeah, maybe you have, but I can't do this on my own.
I need you to help me...
okay?
all right, peter.
you want me to help you?
I want to help.
where did that come from?
that's the wall from parkman's basement.
what's it doing here?
this is our way out. - What?
don't you get it? We have to break through.
can I help you?
I was just leaving.
you're hurt. Let me see.
I'm a doctor. Please.
you don't have to do this. I don't want you to get in trouble.
I have a hearing loss. Say that again?
my name is lauren. I came here to stop samuel sullivan.
you were with the man who shot everyone Bennet?
Bennet never fired his gun.
your leader, samuel, is not what he appears to be.
he's the one responsible.
he wouldn't shoot his own people.
you're wrong. He's done terrible things.
and now he's trying to galvanize his people Around a common enemy.
I got to check in with the doc.
samuel's coming. Don't tell him I'm here!
everything all right?
it's all right.
I just want to talk.
well, look what we have here.
your first wife was murdered by a special?
Yeah.
that was a long time ago.
and the person i was then died that night with kate.
I'm sorry i never told you, claire.
that's okay.
some things you just can't... Say out loud.
but that's the reason why you joined the company.
that's how you became mr. Bag and tag.
no, i don't need to see any more.
one
don't move.
what, you want my wallet? Take it.
I said,"don't move"!
I'm not after your money.
what, then? - Information.
I know what you are. I know what you can do.
how? - It doesn't matter.
I'm looking for somebody-- one of you.
one of me? Wh-- what are you talking about?
you mean there's someone else like me? Don't give me that.
what you do isn't normal.
you have to know each other.
the guy i'm looking for is named richard.
he's about 6 feet tall, got dark hair.
maybe 23 years old.
he can move things with his mind.
he killed my wife.
I don't know anyone else like me. I swear.
I don't believe you.
it was an accident. - You brought a gun.
I didn't know what i would find.
I was scared.
that's the first time you killed anyone, huh?
what happens next?
one owner, low miles
hottest car i got on the lot.
it's the best i can do, so, uh, take it or leave it.
well, i thought you said-- - you know, if you don't want it, i got another buyer over her who's chomping at the bit.
what's it gonna be?
uh, i guess we'll take it.
excellent choice.
I'll have my manager draw up the papers. Excuse me.
Hey, there. Can i interest you in a car?
not really. I'm here to offer you a job.
do i know you?
we've been watching you.
the way you killed that special-- the repairman.
we'd been tracking him too, only you got there first.
relax. Your secret is safe with us.
we're impressed, so impressed, in fact, we'd like you to come work for us.
who are you?
my name is thompson.
my associates and i can help you find the man who killed your wife.
and then you can help us find the rest.
how's it working out for you-- the, uh...
one of us, one of them?
two
to tell you the truth, it's been quite an adjustment.
I mean, claude can go invisible anytime he wants.
it gives him a distinct advantage.
advantage? You're supposed to be partners.
what is it, trust issues?
I mean, how could it not be? He's abnormal.
I mean, sometimes when i'm alone, i get this feeling in my gut that he's watching me.
you know what i mean? - Yeah, i do.
you know, your case is highly unusual, bennet
how you came to our attention, what happened to your wife.
it would be only natural that you would harbor a grudge.
what are you getting at?
17 cases, three deaths, all attributed to you.
they were all accidents. That's been verified.
two corned beefs. You boys need anything else?
no, we're. Uh-- we're all set. Thanks.
at this point, the company has too much invested in you to cut ties.
but we do need you to make a change.
take a wife, start a family.
is that a joke?
no, it'll put your life in balance, calm you down...
so there will be fewer incidents.
a wife?
I can't do that again.
sure, you can.
that cute number who brought the sandwiches will do fine.
and if i refuse? - You won't.
it's like the company arranged your marriage.
they encouraged me, but i chose your mother because i loved her.
you know that.
the company seems to make a lot of decisions for you.
made-- they made a lot of decisions, and that's all over with.
everything you're seeing now, all of it, all of the memories, that's all they are.
it's just the past.
thank
two
Hello, gretchen.
Hey, mr. Bennet. What are you doing here?
came to see claire. You wouldn't happen to know where she is, would you?
n-no idea.
you don't have to lie for her.
I know that claire stole the compass, and i would bet good money the two of you drove out to the carnival together.
my question is, why didn't she come back with you?
she wanted to stay.
she said she'd be back on monday.
you left her there?
do you not see what's happening?
that she is getting involved in something that she clearly doesn't understand.
maybe she wants to understand it.
this isn't a game.
these carnival people are killers.
you don't think i know that?
she needs to be with people like her.
and if they're not good for her, you have to trust her to know the difference.
you have to stop encouraging her.
you need to work with me on this, gretchen.
I want her to be happy.
she is happy, with you here in college, living a normal life.
what if that's not enough for her?
it has to be.
what's he doing here?
are you gonna erase my memory?
no.
not if you do what i ask.
you were missing. I didn't know how to find you-- if i would find you.
you don't trust me.
I don't trust samuel.
Gretchen is fine.
you threatened her!
and this was not some distant past. This was now.
you should eat.
don't need to eat.
don't need to sleep.
don't need anything.
any progress today?
no.
it's just like yesterday...
and the day before that.
and... The day before that.
now it's been
I don't even know how long it's been.
don't tell me how long it's been.
you can't even dent it, peter. I don't know how much longer you can keep this up.
as long as it takes.
I know that look.
you have it all the time.
what look?
like when howie kaplan beat you at the 50-yard dash and you and i ran to school every morning and kept training and kept it up, right?
that is nathan's memory. That's not yours.
I told you to stop doing that.
you're not him.
you're nothing like him.
so you've told me.
look, peter, i know that i've said it before, but...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that i killed him.
I'm sorry that i took him from you. I am
sorry! You keep saying that
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
that's not gonna bring my brother back.
it doesn't change anything.
you're right! Nothing changes!
we're stuck here forever, you and me!
I can't take it anymore.
you're with that company
cut from the same cloth as bennet.
this doesn't have to end badly for you.
you can turn yourself in, release bennet and his daughter.
why would i want to do that?
because you love your family, and you don't want them to get hurt, and they will get hurt.
you people are always so sure of yourselves.
don't you think i would know what's best for my own family?
and what is that?
change. We're strong enough to show ourselves, take what's rightfully ours.
you don't have the right to take anything.
of course we do.
we deserve admiration, respect.
and you intend to hurt people to get it?
what would you have me do
continue with this life...
live in a carnival?
why not? You've lived here happily for years.
wasted years, unfulfilled years.
I could've been so much more.
you know about me?
about the film?
do you know how powerful i can really be...
if i brought them all here?
my brother said i could move mountains, cities.
I wonder. Is it true?
can i change the world?
I hope to god we never find out.
what did the world ever do to you?
should've treated me better.
don't do this, please.
the bennet girl left the house of mirrors.
well, i'll just have to have a word with her.
it's time to gather the family.
tell them to pack up. We're moving on to bigger and better things.
tell them it's gonna be the greatest show we've ever done.
you've been quite helpful, lauren.
Eli, you and your friends take care of her, would you? Thanks.
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna end this.
I can't bring nathan back, peter.
but i can sure as hell swing a sledgehammer.
I'm sorry to put you through that, claire, but i hope through this painful experience you can finally see the truth.
Yeah.
you were right, samuel.
my dad is a bad guy.
I belong with you.
you're my hero.
that's what you want to hear, right?
that's what this is all about.
why didn't you show me the memory my dad has of shooting lydia? Hmm?
or was that just not on the program?
maybe he didn't pull the trigger last night.
but does that negate all the times that he has?
your father, to this day, lies to you, deceives even you, his darling daughter, because he can't trust any of us.
you actually thought that i would turn on him?
you just don't understand, do you, huh?
maybe it was 'cause no one ever really loved you.
you call these people your family, but they're not. They fear you.
give me my dad, and we're leaving.
no, sorry. You're too important to me, claire, especially now when everything's ready to change.
what's going on? Where's everyone going?
I was talking to a new friend about who i am, what i can be, and the way she looked at me, she was so afraid.
I want to see that look again a thousand times over.
meaning what?
it's time for our biggest show ever.
no more hiding in the shadows.
it's time to show ourselves, be strong.
we're going to new york city, bring the whole place to central park.
then we'll show them how powerful we are.
you can't do that.
some lives will, unfortunately, be lost.
but they'll learn to fear us, respect us.
it's what we've always wanted.
I have never wanted that.
Claire, you will inherit this new world.
it's your legacy.
and you will remind them what i've done long after i've gone.
that's why it's so important for you to be a part of our family.
you are desperate...
and you're small.
I will never be a part of your family.
you sound just like your father.
I had so hoped to convince you.
maybe in time you'll change your mind.
don't hold your breath.
right.
your father's back in the souvenir trailer.
I had a little trouble with the government lady
playing some cat and mouse, but the mouse got away.
do you want me to go find her? - Not worth it.
everything okay? - It will be.
Claire bennet needs some time to think about my offer.
I'm gonna give her that opportunity.
I want to explain what you saw.
we'll talk about it later.
what is that?
now i'm ready to go...
new york city.
sounds fun.
it will be.
I'm afraid you'll have to join us later.
there's some loose ends to attend to.
before lydia died, she spoke of people who want to interfere with our plans.
I'll need you to stop them... Permanently.
happy birthday.
it's not my birthday.
Yeah, i know.
you just wore out your other copy, and...
and i saw that one, digging around.
I appreciate you...
being patient with me, keeping me sane.
that's very kind of you, peter. Thank you.
you want to know something weird?
every time you pick that thing up, i think you're gonna hit me with it really hard.
that is weird, because every time i pick it up, i feel like i'm gonna hit you with it too... Really hard.
Why?
because you are who you are.
I wish i could accept your apologies, but if i forgive you, then i'm not doing right by him.
if you let go of your anger, you're afraid you'll lose him forever?
so you've held on to it this entire time?
I feel it slipping away, but...
then i look at you, and i see you killing him.
you took my brother away from me.
we've been here for i don't know how many years...
together.
I've changed. I've repented.
I'm never gonna hurt anyone ever again.
and all this time, you were afraid to let me out.
I'm not that guy anymore, peter. You know that.
I know.
I know you're not.
how long has it been, really?
half a day, maybe.
it feels like we were in there for years.
Yeah.
does that make it any less real?
let's go save emma.
sorry to break up the love fest, but i'm here to make sure that that doesn't happen.
there's no signal.
Claire, you all right? - Yeah, you?
Yeah. Here, help me get these ropes off.
is that a lantern over there?
we're buried.
how far down do you think we are?
I don't know. It felt like we dropped 40 or 50 feet.
Hello?
can anybody hear us?
help! Can anybody hear us?
to BE
get out of my head.
this is a dream.
no, it's not a dream!
I came to take you out of here.
in the dream, emma, my friend you save her before she kills thousands of people.
you really think you can get us out of here?
let me see you try.
Charlie was my heart, my world, my happily ever after.
I did everything i could to try and save her life.
where is charlie?
I'm the only one who knows exactly where your sweet charlie is.
please help him.
it is our intent to prove that the defendant abused his power to bend space and time selfishly and repeatedly.
111a 222a 333a you think showing me my dad's memories is gonna enlighten me?
don't do this.
you afraid she'll see the real you, bennet?
you brought a gun. - i was scared.
that's the first time you killed anyone.
you actually thought that i would turn on him?
Claire bennet needs some time to think about my offer.
it's time to gather the family. we're moving on to bigger and better things.
it's gonna be the greatest show we've ever done.
dad? dad?
I'm here.
there's no signal.
Claire? you okay?
Yeah. you?
Yeah, here, help me get these ropes off.
is that a lantern over there?
we're buried.
how far down do you think we are?
I don't know, it felt like we dropped about 40 or 50 feet.
Hello?
can anyone hear us?
help! hello, can anybody hear us?
Hello, anybody up there?
somebody help us!
help! can anybody hear us?
can you hear us out there?
half a day, maybe.
feels like we were in there for years.
is your buddy samuel here with you?
came alone this time...
so to speak.
what do you want?
samuel asked me to come here and make sure your friends downstairs aren't a problem for us.
I guess that means you too.
sorry to break up the lovefest.
come on.
you're having doubts about this.
look at you. come on, i can tell.
you don't really want to do this.
what i want doesn't matter.
I don't have another choice.
don't bother. we got you outnumbered.
you want to leave, right now.
are you trying to push a thought?
all but one of us are pretty...thoughtless.
tonight will be a night unlike any other.
tonight...
we change everything.
for too many years, we've been shamed into believing we're secondclass citizens.
when the truth is, we're king of the hill!
they should aspire to be like us, not the other way around.
that's right.
and so i make this pledge to you.
tonight...
once and for all, we pull back the curtain and reveal ourselves for who we truly are.
after tonight, we will be respected.
444a think about what you're doing.
don't do this!
don't!
Matt! matt? are you okay?
no.
here. sit.
okay, okay, okay.
it's just dislocated.
awesome.
what the hell is he doing here?
Yes, it's time for your solo.
777a how do you think all the people are gonna find us?
you're gonna bring them here.
I told you you had a unique gift. now it's time to put it to use.
888d what dream?
999d 0000d thousands of people will die.
he was right about you.
you disappoint me, emma.
you can't force me to do anything.
I would have preferred you were a willing participant.
but these things happen.
she's all yours, mr. doyle.
I've always had a thing for blondes.
111111s 22222s 333333s 444444s 555555s 6666666s 77777s 888888s 99999999s 0000000s 11111111d 22222d 3333f 44444s 5555s 666s 7777s excuse me. hiro nakamura?
the woman in room 1106 asked me to give this to you.
8888S 999S i trapped him...in a nightmare.
what the hell's he doing out? you did this.
both: it's a long story.
but right now we need to know what samuel is planning when and where.
thousands of people are in danger, matt.
get in his head, matt. tell us what you see.
why, so you guys can run off and be superheroes together?
this is ridiculous.
Peter, come on, he's a monster.
I can't believe you actually trust him!
you want something done?
samuel's gonna show the world his powers...
new york city...
central park, tonight.
what does he mean, show his power?
samuel's gonna open up the ground, kill them all, bury them.
that sounds like a plan i'd come up with back in the day.
you say that like it wasn't yesterday.
I'm not that person anymore, matt.
I know it's hard to understand.
we got what we needed. let's go.
you're not going anywhere.
you leave with sylar, people are gonna end up dead.
and that'll be on you. i can't let that happen.
let's go.
I'm not going anywhere.
what are you talking about? - that would be me.
see, i can still push a thought.
I told you, peter, i'm not letting him out of here.
we're too deep.
no, we're not.
we can dig our way out.
it might take a while, but we'll run out of oxygen way before that.
the more we dig, the faster we'll run out of air...
or more precisely, the faster i'll run out of air. your lungs will keep regenerating.
what are you saying?
it's futile.
what do you mean "futile"?
we have to find some way out of here.
I think i know why samuel put you down here with me.
so you could watch me die.
lure them in.
111S 222S 333S oh, excuse me.
my god.
when i saw the nurse's chart said "hiro nakamura," i couldn't believet.
it's been an awfulong time, hiro, ever since the burnt toast diner 65 years ago.
we have to focus. we have to think of something.
Claire. - dad, you have a plan.
I know you have a plan. what iit?
there is no plan.
now, i need to talk to you about what you saw up there in the house of miors.
Why? - because you're gonna survive this.
if it takes a month, you will get out of here.
I'm not going to.
that's not true. - yes, it is.
and there are things that i need to say to you.
what you saw up there, all of it, it's all true.
but it's not the whole truth.
dad, you don't have to do this.
now, e are all products of our own experiences, good and bad.
everything that's happened to me has madee who i am, but it can't explain what i've become.
you are my dad, for bett or for worse!
don't protect me, claire! that's my job.
to protect me? from the rest of the world?
Yes, exactly.
and that's why you believe that people like me can't live out in the open it doesn't matter what i believe anymore, because the whole world is about to find out about you.
we can thank samuel for that.
maybe it won't be so bad.
maybe the world is more ready than you think it is. things change.
sure.
there might be curiosity for a while, but all it takes is one sylar, and then the pitchforks come out, and all hell breaks loose.
I've seen it.
they will turn on you, claire.
it's human nature.
you're right. things change.
but people don't.
Sylar kied your brother, peter. he killed nathan.
I've repented.
Oh, yeah, during the nightmare.
right, 'cause that lasted all of what, a couple hours?
not to us, matt. that was five years.
look, you heard what samuel's planning. we can stop him.
I don't expect you to understand what happened in that nightmare.
and i don't expect you to forgive me.
good, ause that'll never happen.
I've done so much wrong to so many people. just give me a chance to redeem myself.
I've been inside of your head, so i have a pretty good idea of what it takes to be a good person.
go inside mine.
and you make the call.
you see it...
right here.
no, what i saw was inside your twisted mind.
that wasn't your heart.
I can prove it.
just give me a chance.
you need to trust us, matt.
fine.
just get get the hell out of my home.
let's go.
now you are going to do exactly what i tell you to do.
Emma's doing an incredible job.
it's quite a crowd.
they've all come out to see us.
see us do what? our acts?
what else would i be referring to?
those news cameras...
you invite them too?
the world needs to meet us, edgar.
it's the biggest show we've ever done.
you seem nervous.
you aren't nervous, are you?
excited.
tonight changes everything...
for all of us.
he was there waiting as i left the burnt toast that day.
some old man said he was a friend of samuel sullivan, put his hand on my shoulder.
next thing i knew, i was on a street corner in milwaukee.
it was january 26, 1944.
Oh, no.
it was cold.
I was ared.
I didn't know a soul, and i missed you.
and you lived all this time.
I got a job in a munitions factory.
all the girls did back then.
did you realize it takes 108 pounds of rivets to hold the wing of a p51 mustang in place?
unless, of course, you use the 14gauge instead of the 16gauge charlie, i'm ssorry.
this was all my fault.
I led e evil butterfly man right to you.
it is because i loved you that he sent you away.
when i said that i was the product of my experiences, i left out the most important part...
you.
you came into my life, and you changed everything.
the man you saw up there in those memories could never have died a happy man.
but i can, because of you.
no, no, no, no, don'tdon't say that. don't say that.
try to find a way to forgive me, claire.
no.
I don't need to forgive you.
I need to thank you.
I am who i am because of you.
I love you.
I love you too, claire bear.
so i want you to promise me something...
that you'll hide.
what?
the world doesn't have to know about you.
UYou can stay in.
you can blend in.
you can pass, claire. you know how to do it.
dad, we don't have to do this. we can find a way out.
I want you to promise me you'll stay hidden. claire, please.
it's my dying wish, claire.
please, promise me.
no, no. dad? no. no!
dad! dad, no!
I don't know what to do. he's dying.
not if i can help it. come on.
dad.
Noah. - dad.
Tracy. - we have to get you through 30 feet of dirt.
you ready?
come on. come on. come on. come on. come on.

he will as soon as we get out of here.
I hope you can swim.
dad. you okay?
Tracy saved us.
I know. i called her.
carnival's ge?
they're in new york, central park.
I lined up a chopper. it'll take us right into manhattan. it'll be here any...
second.
where is she?
she said you oweer one.
we've got to go.
don't beat yourself up, hiro.
I would have waited for you, but by the time you were born, was middleaged.
I'm just so happy i got to see you before...
you're not well.
the good news is that brain aneurysm never bothered me again after your weird doctor friend cured me.
unfortunately, etty much everything else is about to give out.
I can fix this, charlie.
fix this?
how do you mean?
I can fix everything.
I'm sorry. will you excuse us foone minute?
a b c d e
G h he's done it.
he's brought in thousands of people.
this is gonna be a massacre.
we got to find the backstage area. yoknow where it is?
Yeah, it's back that way.
all right, let's split up.
you go that way, and i'll heaoff this way.
okay. - claire...
be careful.
you too.
this way.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
the dream. - what?
all these people they're all here, like lambs to the slaughter.
it's not gonna happen, peter.
go finsamuel. i'll save them.
your dream said i save her.
trust me.
it's an emergency.
tell hiro he needs to get here as fast as he can.
where do you think you're going?
don't worry.
I've come to save you.
what brings you to the big apple?
everybody.
everybody listen to me, please. please, okay?
we need to get you as far away from samuel as possible.
you don't belong here, claire.
look, i know what he told you out tonight, that you're coming out and that you're gonna be able to live out in the open.
and trust me, there is nobody who wants that more than me.
but this is not your comingout party.
this is his.
well, look who finally came up for air.
what are you doing here, aire?
you're not part of this family.
you're right. i'm not.
but let me ask you something.
does your family know what you're planning to do here tonight?
why don't you tell them?
he's gonna kill alof those people out there.
that's how he's gonna introduce u to the world.
why would he do that, claire?
he's given us all new life.
if he hadn't found me, i'd still be living out in that park.
homeless.
they know the truth, claire.
tonight is our night.
I never wanted to hurt your family, edgar.
ask yoself if thas true of samuel.
he killed his own brother.
I'm only here to stop him from murdering a lot of other people.
then you and i have the same goal.
I can't just kill him in front of the others.
and you strike me as the kind of man with a plan.
so what do we do?
it's simple.
I'll be waiting for you in 1944.
when you pop in on that snowy reet corner, i'll take you back to burnt toast diner, right where i left you.
and i'd be young again and we can finally build a life together.
that sounds nice.
bu hiro, i already had a life. i had a wonderl life.
65 years is a long time.
grandma!
Hey, there, honeysuckle.
Where's mommy and daddy?
they're talking to the nurse oh.
this is an old fend of mine. his name is hiro.
that's a funny ne.
Hello, ally.
Sally, go find mommy and daddy so they can meet hiro, okay?
okay.
Hiro...
after thwar, i married a wonderful man.
we had four childr. i now haveeven beautiful grandchildren.
wead a home, friends cherishememories...
a life.
if i were to go back now d lead a different life, what would happen withll that?
what would happen to sally?
Hiro.
le, i don't want to hurt you.
just let her go, please.
since when do you ask politely?
a lot of people are gonna die if wdon't stop this.
are you a apeshifter?
is that dudley doright in there?
yocan't hold us here forever.
I don't plan on it...
just long enough for suel to finish the show.
isn't that right, em?
Oh, i don't think shheard me.
are you okay?
Sylar, please.
listen to me.
ease, samuel made me do it.
Really?
cause i thought you were the puppet master.
Oh, come on.
what do u care about this girl, anywa i am here to save her.
that's not you.
you're like me.
no.
m a hero.
you think you're here to save them, claire, but they don't need saving. th know what i've done for them.
do they know that you in your strength from them?
you are the source of his power.
without you, he is nothi.
that's why joseph was keeping this familsmall for all those years, because he knew.
he knew how powerful samuel could be, that he would lose control just like he did when he buried that town.
but you all walk away now, and will be weak.
he will be ordary. he will be nothing.
I think we've all hed enough, am i right?
he's using you, and that's what joseph w trying to keep from happening.
but why don'you tell them what you did to stop him?
that's enough! - he killed him.
he killed his own brother!
you thk they're gonna believe you over me?
they'd be lost without me.
there's not one person here who thinks i'm capable of murdering my own brother.
there's on actually.
make that two.
Lydia told me everything.
well, she's not here @e to confirm that w, is she?
because he killed her. - that's a lie.
isn't it?
tell the truth, samuel.
you had me kill lydia.
I did no such thing.
you blamed it on me to justify what you're going to do tonight.
at, you're gonna believe him, after all i've done for you?
I know i can't stay in this family after lling one of our own.
but has to be stopped.
it's up to all of you.
Claire right. you walk away, and he's powerless.
it'sver, samuel.
come on.
let's get out of here.
now wait, wait, wait, it, wait, wait, wait. where are you going?
don't you see?
you're victims.
all of you, like joseph.
run as fast as you can.
you'll never get far enoh!

chapter fifteen "Run
Hello?
um...you might not remember me.
we--we haven't spoken in a long time, but...I just had...
our daughter just found me.
did you hear what I just said?
she's alive.
we need to talk.
Nathan, are you still there?
it's--it's been 14 years.
I went to your funeral.
look, that fire-- it--it wasn't an accident.
someone was out to get me, and the police, they just assumed I was dead, so...I ran.
and our daughter?
well, she's got an angel on her shoulder, that one.
she was adopted by a nice family here in texas.
she's 16 now.
and she's beautiful.
she's got blond hair, like me.
and she is smart, just like you.
maybe one day she'll run for congress.
the timing of...your call, two weeks before my election, that--that's not a coincidence, is it?
a child born out of wedlock, that's big news.
you wouldn't want that to come out.
ruin things for you.
how much do you want?
Oh, um...$100, 000?
Yeah. That oughta cover it.
I'll let you know where to send it.
nice and easy.
mom, are you okay?
I've been better.
she'll be fine.
just needs a little rest.
a little time to recover.
recover from what?
she, uh, had an appointment with a neurologist, who ran some tests.
what kind of tests?
your mother's been having some headaches.
Yeah, she's also been having some memory loss, did you tell them that?
of course, claire.
I'm handling it.
don't worry, honey, I'll be fine.
Mr. Muggles isn't worried, is he?
no, he's not.
D. L.Won't be fooled.
sure he will.
love is blind, and if last night is any indication, he won't be able to see anything for a long time.
Nik, baby, I gotta get going.
I'll be right there.
mm, don't you look all secret service.
is this standard issue for bodyguards?
bodyguards? We're not called "bodyguards" anymore, honey.
it's "private security.
whatever you want to call it, it's paying the bills.
are we ever gonna talk about it?
talk about what?
what we can do.
our powers.
I just feel like we're supposed to be fighting crime or something.
that's true.
but for now, can you just have fun at school, my young genius?
Yep.
all right. Baby, there's a package for you over on the table.
Thanks.
are you taking your gun?
it's the difference between $500 and $350 a day.
my carry permit.
you're not gonna need it, though, right?
I'm basically a glorified babysitter.
nothing's gonna happen.
I hope not.
thank god you called.
playing house is making me cranky.
I understand. The guy stole his money. He wants him dead.
what mr. Linderman wants, mr. Linderman gets.
Mr. malsky.
I'm malsky.
here to protect you, sir.
bang.
I'd like to point out an ovservation here.
Hiro, we;re back in Las Vegas.
right where we started.
only this time...
we have to sneak into Linderman's hotel!
we have less than two weeks.
to stop the bomb from destroying New York City!
face it. hiro, It's a lost cause.
Ando. I will never give up.
and neither should you.
more than anything a hero must have hope.
fine. You figure out how to get into Linderman's office.
I will find hope.
excuse me.
are you okay, miss?
anything we can do to help?
no, I couldn't possibly...
we're complete strangers.
I'm ando.
this is my friend, hiro.
Hi. I'm hope.
so. Where are we headed?
diamond district. Broadway and 6th.
what a beautiful day to be in los angeles.
look at this weather. And the air?
what's your name again?
listen, parkman. The job is simple.
you drive me downtown, we meet a man, I make a deal, then you drive me back to the airport.
you just make sure no one bothers me.
that includes you.
hope this loser knows how to use his gun.
otherwise, we're both dead.
my name's dr. Mohinder suresh.
it's very important that I speak with him.
I assure you, my interest is legitimate.
my name is dr. Mohinder suresh.
it's really rather complicated to explain over the...
this is dr. Mohinder suresh.
a certain genetic trait...
Hello?
have you noticed anything unusual about his behavior?
my name is dr. Mohinder suresh.
are you still there?
one new message.
Hi. This is, uh, zane.
I, uh, I got your phone message.
and, um, something is happening to me.
I can't control it.
I...I think we need to talk.
please hurry.
can you come see me right away?
it's really, um
five minutes, ladies. Five minutes.
we've dated for a few months.
um...He lives in L. A. Comes to visit.
and at first, he was really sweet.
but...now he'S...just horrible.
he even hit me once.
your boyfriend did this to you?
I'm sorry.
I left this morning while he was sleeping.
but I forgot my bag.
it's-- it's pink and it has rhinestones on it and it's got all my money and my credit cards and it even has my family photos in it that I can't replace.
I should go up there and talk to him.
maybe he won't be so mad.
no. We will do it. - Eh?
excuse us, please.
what about our mission?
he hit her, She can't go back there.
we'll sneak in. Get her bag
you want to break into a hotel room and steal a bag?
you said I needed to find Hope. It's a sign.
it's a coincidence!
why is it that whenever you want to do something...
it's our destiny.
but when I want to do something, it's not important.
Charlie...Linderman...
Charlie was special.
hang on.
did you two say something about mr. Linderman?
Yes. You know him?
well, not personally, but everybody knows who he is.
um, I know people who do.
that's great.
she can help us.
if we get your bag, can you introduce us?
Yeah, I can do that.
we still have a problem.
how do we get past security?
I have an idea.
who's there?
room service.
I didn't order room service.
Ah! Complimentary for high roller.
Ah, very nice room.
how are you today?
you're done.
this is a terrible idea.
all because you like this girl.
a hero does not have regrets.
we're wasting time.
I should just go to Linderman's office without you.
we need to go. now
why >did you find hope's bag?
a heroes never runs.
stop saying the things I say to you!
we have to leave!
no. All this time, I have trusted you.
now, it's your turn to trust me.
I have no powers.
a man does not need powers to be a hero.
we'll call the police.
come on. We're leaving now
fine.
Ando!
Ando! Please hurry.
Oh, god. Hurry...hurry.
please hurry. Please hurry...
Dr. Suresh?
Yes. Yes.
thank god.
come in.
I was starting to think you weren't going to show. I didn't know what I was gonna do.
I mean, look at what I'm living with.
Yes, I see what you mean. I'm just a regular guy.
I mean...
I've never been different or--or special, or
I mean, no one would even look at me twice walking down the street.
I guess I should show you. Right?
what I do, you need to see it, right?
Yes, of course.
okay. I haven't left the apartment for three weeks.
I'm going a little crazy.
maybe you should step back.
it can get a little messy.
we reap what we sow, nathan.
you have no one to blame but yourself.
I'll go down to texas and handle it.
so close to the election? Don't be ridiculous.
if the press gets wind of this, especially on the heels of the linderman scandal
I cared about meredith once.
I owe her more than a phone call. I owe them both.
besides. I'm this girl's father, come on.
you're a glorified sperm donor.
don't get emotionally attached.
how can you be so cold? - Because I know you, nathan.
beneath the gruff exterior, you're a sap.
the moment that young girl looks at you with her sad little weepy eyes, you're lost, you're finished.
you'll start giving, and she'll start taking until there's nothing left.
so prioritize, nathan.
wire the money to texas.
focus on the people who really matter.
how's mom?
your mother's resting.
so I understand you and zach cut school yesterday.
mom said we could.
it was for our report.
we went to the aquarium.
with these tickets?
printed from your computer? These fake tickets, claire?
you're spying on me?
I don't know where you were, and I don't want to know.
you're a teenager, you need to assert your independence. But this behavior...
it's unacceptable.
you're grounded, young lady.
you're to be home every day at 5: 00 sharp until further notice.
what? You can't do that! You have no right.
I'm your father. - You're not my real father.
no, I'm not.
but I'm as close as you've got.
so you'll stay home at night.
until you earn our trust back.
Hello? - Hi.
it's me, claire.
do you have a second to talk about my father?
Oh, hey, claire. I'm glad you called.
talk about coincidence. I found your father.
you're kidding. What'd he say?
well, after he got over the shock that we were both alive, he was actually kinda sweet.
said he'd be happy to help us out. Sounded real generous, too.
says he's gonna fly right down from new york.
well, I want to meet him.
Oh, right.
well--well, I-I don't know about that.
but he's my father.
right. Well, um...
why don't I talk to him, and we'll see what he says.
you know what, claire? I actually have to go. But, um,
I'll call you later, all right?
I love you.
I've got the money.
let's see the diamonds.
stones range from 2 to 9 carats.
my offer is more than generous.
not that it matters.
Linderman's guy...
will be here soon.
you won't get out alive.
sir. Sir, please. Please.
we have gotta get out of here right now.
this is a setup.
What--how do you know that? - I just do. You have to trust me.
you've got a deal.
I gotta run.
who's linderman? - My ex-employer.
how do you know his name? - Never mind that.
why has he sent someone here to kill you?
because I stole his $2 million.
should've been out of the country by now.
great. You stole the money.
how do you know?
wait a second. You gotta get me out of here.
take this.
there's another one for you when you get me out.
no, you can't bribe me.
I don't want to die.
two in the bodyguard. Then malsky gets one in the gut.
two in the bodyguard. Then malsky gets one in the gut.
she's in there.
this should be fun.
I do all the work, he takes half the profit.
I'm sick of it.
no, I got these two chinese guys to help me out.
turned on the waterworks and they were mine.
Yep...
they're getting the suitcase as we speak.
all right.
I'll catch the bus from primm and meet you in barstow.
I love you too, leon.
Oh, hi!
I didn't see you come in.
you were on telephone.
uh, with my mom.
so, um... where's the bag?
we are not chinese. We are japanese.
whatever.
Where's... the bag?
you are a bad person.
you may have fooled ando, but you do not fool me.
thanks for the help, sulu.
what are you doing?
we can't stop here. Keep moving.
al right, this way, this way! This way!
come on! Come on!
okay... go to the elevator.
you can't do this.
you have to stop!
don't worry, niki.
I don't plan on being little miss homemaker forever.
just gotta lay low for a while.
you're chasing two men with a gun in broad daylight.
you call that laying low?
this is my life. My child!
you can't do this! - I have to.
somebody's gotta repay linderman.
you made the deal to get me out of jail?
I couldn't leave it up to you now, could I?
the elevator's not coming.
who are you calling? - Backup.
you can't bring the cops into this!
Terry, hey! It's parkman. I'm working security-- diamond district.
6th and broadway. I got a shooter, possibly two.
send everyone you got.
come on!
all right, you go to the other side of the building.
cops will be here soon. I'll buy us some time.
drop your weapon.
over the side, right now.
okay, where's your partner?
partner? - Come on-- your partner!
I heard you arguing with her.
Niki, right? Where is she?
you heard niki?
where is she?
she's probably killing malsky...
right now.
fourth one over, third one back.
fourth one over, third one back.
Hey, there you are. Come on, let's go!
me again. - Ahh!
No! Don't!
Hey, claire.
what are you doing here?
I have to see my father.
you don't understand.
I'll wait here all night if I have to.
why don't we take a walk?
it's my mom...
she's sick. I think it's bad.
Oh, I'm so sorry. How can I help?
you said my father had money.
you said he had power and that he wanted to help us.
I thought maybe he could- - oh, honey, honey
I didn't mean that kind of help. I mean just money.
I don't understand.
your daddy-- he's, um...
how do I explain this? He'S...
when your daddy found out that I was pregnant with you...
what I'm trying to say is that you can't count on him.
he'll give us cash because that's easy. But anything else, he'll just disappoint you.
he doesn't even want to meet me?
Oh, claire.
please.
why'd you even tell me about him?
because he wants to give us some money.
$50, 000, and you're entitled to half of that.
I don't want his money.
I, uh, I'm heading back to mexico for a while.
so we're probably not gonna see each other.
I want you to take real good care of yourself, okay?
hang on.
so I can remember that sweet face.
police! Get your hands up!
I'm on the-- I'm on the job.
hello. Zane taylor?
Yes.
you must be dr. Suresh. Come on in.
can I get you some tea?
sorry it took me so long to get here.
no, it's no problem.
is earl grey okay?
Yes, that'll be fine.
you, um...
sounded rather alarmed on the phone.
you seemed to have calmed down some.
I had a kind of epiphany about it this morning.
are you familiar with abraham maslow, the peak experience?
I'm afraid not.
it's, um...
a single moment that takes you out of yourself.
makes you feel very tiny or very large.
to some extent, one with life or nature or god.
I see...
like seeing all the pieces of a puzzle fit together.
all this time, I was trying to fight it.
deny it.
but there is no shame in having this ability, is there?
none whatsoever.
it would be like denying you have brown eyes.
right.
so, um...
I guess that you-- you want to see my ability.
Yes! I mean, I'm quite anxious to document it.
you might want to step back. That looks like a nice jacket.
my god!
you want to see it again?
look, for what it's worth, I'm sorry for the way things turned out.
you know, I could've been a-- A much better person back then.
you politicians, you sure know your way around an apology.
you and me, we were never gonna work out.
two diff-- different worlds. - Yeah.
I, uh...
I hope this goes a long way toward making up for the fact that I wasn't there.
for both of you.
so...
where is she?
Claire? - mm-hmm.
you just missed her.
did she want to see me? - yeah.
I snapped a photo of her.
look how beautiful she is.
I'm--I'm sure she is.
take a look, nathan.
she came here with her bags all packed.
she thought you were gonna rescue her from her tragic life.
that sound familiar?
I told her you're just here to pay your money and go.
did I speak out of turn?
I could call her. I could get her to come back.
you did fine.
you did just fine.
I should probably be heading back to my family.
just the kids.
I'm very interested in how you control this...
ability.
well, it's, like...
riding a bike for the first time. It's a little wobbly.
and then I discovered something.
a kind of peace.
a sense of purpose that can only be described as destiny.
I'd like to take a dna sample.
from me, okay. Um, sure.
just swab it on the inside of your mouth.
the tea. If you'll excuse me for a second. - Of course.
I just swab it on the inside of my cheek?
Yes, that's right.
there you go.
DNA sample.
thank you.
you know...
you should be careful who you talk to about this ability, zane.
there's some people who might not understand.
who might want to hurt you.
why would anybody want to hurt me?
I don't know yet. But I do know this
there are others out there like you.
Really? How many others?
dozens. And those are just the ones I know about.
with more time and research, I could find hundreds, thousands!
but, uh...
you're the first one who's returned my phone calls.
but I am going to find them.
all of them.
I could go with you.
I could help you. Think about it.
these people could need convincing.
who better to do that?
ando, over here!
you got it.
my hero.
I was trapped under a bed. Your boyfriend is very large.
you mean ex-boyfriend.
come on. I need a ride to primm. My mom's house.
I'm sure she would love to meet you.
where-- where's hiro?
Oh, um, I took him to meet the guy who could introduce him to mr. Linderman.
he didn't wait for me?
he said he didn't really need you anymore.
but I didn't even give you your bag yet.
why didn't you wait for me
three's a crowd, baby.
we gotta go.
one.
two.
three.
Ando?
is that you? I'm locked in!
she's an awful woman!
and so strong!
she punched me!
you're not ando.
s. R. Gustavson, state gaming commission.
I come in peace.
I only saw the blonde-- yes.
but I heard them talking. I know there were two of them.
I'm telling you, she was incredibly strong.
she--she-- she broke my handcuffs.
any idea where the diamonds are?
you didn't find the case?
no.
I guess the incredibly strong killer and her partner must've taken it.
fourth one over, third one back.
fourth one over, third one
what a joke. Parkman. What a joke.
can't even do a decent job as a rent-a-cop.
he'll never wear a police badge again in his life.
you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
mom, I'm home!
to survive in this world, we hold close to us those people on whom we depend.
we trust in them our hopes, our fears.
go away, you!
mom, what's going on?
this mangy thing came at me out of nowhere.
I think it has rabies. Go away! Scat!
mom, this is your dog, mr. Muggles. You love him.
I don't have a dog.
I don't know any mr. Muggles.
and I don't know you.
but what happens when trust is lost?
where do we run when things we believe in vanish before our eyes?
it's time.
Micah, did I get another package?
Yeah, it's in your bedroom.
Thanks.
I'm opening it now.
when all seems lost, the future unknowable, our very existence in peril...
Yeah, I remember him.
not a problem.
consider it done.
all we can do...
is run.
I have no idea,
I'm just trying to figure out how to take care of our family.
I don't have a job, Jan.
they're gonna pay for what they did to me, what they did to us.
there is no putting this whole thing behind you.
we gotta find out what they did and make them fix it!
you wanted to know why I was invisible all these years.
it was because of them, and you've brought the bastards right to my door!
tell me, Clarie. Can you keep a secert？
your mother has a subdural hemorrhage.
it's like a bruise on her brain.
specifically the area that controls memory.
you erased her mind.
Claire, that's ridiculous.
you tried to erase mine.
what you know is dangerous.
why did you do this to mom?
I only wanted to protect my family.
Texas Odessa chapter seventeen "company man"
I've had enough of that!
don't, don't, don't!
I'm not gonna nuke the dog!
I wouldn't hurt, uh...
Mr. Muggles, would I?
Yeah, well, you know what?
if you wanted to hurt this guy, that'd be the way to do it.
there are more pictures of dogs around here than there are of his kids.
you don't really think that he's stupid and or sloppy enough to leave incriminating evidence around the house.
he did just get raided by the FBI.
we couldn't get a warrant for the house.
so in the off chance that he is a little sloppy or stupid,
I wanna poke around.
so now we're jacking his computer?
you wanna sit around all day and download files?
I don't.
if we don't find anythingon his pc, there's is somewhere else we can look.
inside his head!
I plan on that.
we're gonna bag the smug son of a bitch at his paper factory.
see how he likes it.
maybe we can bag him here.
Oh, god. He's with his family.
family's a pretty good motivator.
no, no. I am not taking any hostages.
we bag him at the paper factory.
no, no, no. That was plan A.
plan B is much better.
there is no plan B.
we leave...now!
how many times you gonna let this guy slip through your fingers?
Lyle, help your mother.
Claire, talk to me!
what's the point?
am I even gonna remember this conversation?
would you keep your voice down?
Lyle, take your mother and get out of the house right now!
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.
we all do.
honey, what's happening?
Yeah, dad, what's happening?
stay calm.
Yeah.
let's just everyone stay calm.
okay, everyone stays calm, nobody's gonna get hurt.
this is officer Parkman of the LAPD.
formerly of the LAPD thanks to you.
what do you want from me?
you come into my house with guns?
not guns.
gun.
I don't need a gun, do I, Mr. Bennet?
not after what you did to me.
I don't know you.
if you insist on lying, you're gonna upset me.
and you know what happens when I get upset, I get very bright...
and very hot.
no, no, no. Ted is gonna do us all a favor.
right, Ted-- and he's not gonna get upset.
but you gotta help.
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm just a paper salesman.
no. No...
you're not.
so tell me.
how do you feel about paper?
wildly enthusiastic.
good.
cause as far as friends and family are concerned, it's your life.
Congratulations.
you are the new regional manager for Primatech paper.
nice cover.
sorry to make a liar out of you.
but it's part and parcel of what we do.
nobody outside the organization knows.
well, they can't know.
people are fragile...
like tea cups.
all around them, the world is changing and they simply don't wanna deal with it.
they don't wanna know what's happening to us as a species.
and they certainly don't wanna know the measures we take to keep them safe.
now you'll be asked to do things that fall into morally grey territory.
things that most would find cruel...
but men like you and I know to be necessary.
I'm comfortably with morally grey.
good. You will have a partner.
one of them.
that's how we do it here.
keeps us all honest.
great! When do I meet him?
he's all ready here.
is this a test?
Oh shoot!
how did--how did-- how is that...
it's a brave new world, friend.
go ahead.
tell 'em what you do.
what goes on at that "paper factory" of yours, Mr. Bennet?
he abducts people!
he--he drugs us!
he injects us with I don't know what.
I lost my job and I am trying not to lose my wife.
but you don't care about that, do you?
you don't care about what you did to me.
all you care about is that we think that nothing happened.
makes us forget.
how can he make you forget?
the Haitian.
that's right. The Haitian.
she knows?
this is your fault.
she knows this is his fault.
he's got 'em all fooled except for her.
just when you thought plausible deniability was gonna save your ass.
the Haitian...
made her mother forget...
and her brother but not...
why didn't he make you forget?
what is he talking about, Claire?
I don't know anything.
you wanna put a stop to all this?
all you need to do to keep your family safe, to keep us all safe, is just tell the truth.
I am telling the truth.
no, this...
is the truth!
Oh, my god!
this is what you did to me.
settle down, Ted.
we just wanna be normal again.
he's not a paper salesman.
guess she's not daddy's little girl anymore.
he's getting inside your daughter's head.
I can run.
get some help.
they can't hurt me.
I know you're thinking about being a hero--don't!
don't! This guy is serious.
and he's really dangerous and I need your help to make sure that nobody gets hurt.
you can read my mind.
Yeah, that's something your dad did to me.
it didn't just happen?
I wouldn't be here right now if it just happened.
has my dad done this to other people?
as far as I can tell, it's different with everyone.
I've seen some weird things.
I'm sure you have too, like that stuff at your school.
he can do what I can do.
what do you know about him?
he can do what I can do.
he's different...like you.
save the cheerleader.
I read his mind, he read mine.
he told me to protect you...from someone who was killing people like me.
are you different, Claire?
your blood was all over that crime scene.
you didn't have a scratch on you.
why didn't you have a scratch on you?
I can heal.
did my dad make me this way?
what are they gonna do with the baby?
I don't know.
Nah.
they would've told us.
Claude, a word please.
no mother?
your son?
that's correct.
I imagine.
it's not a request.
once again.
if she manifests.
of course.
did you make me this way?
is that why you adopted me?
am I some sort of experiment?
don't talk to your father like that.
he's not my father.
they have nothing to do with this.
he's the one who got 'em involved.
no, we did!
you and me, we didn't leave this house when they came home.
look, no one's been hurt yet.
what's he gonna do, go to the police?
we can get out of here right now.
we didn't get what we came for.
we came for a cure.
what if there isn't one?
I'll kill us all.
just get inside his head and get some answers or we're all gonna have a really bad day.
that son of a bitch is thinking in japanese.
why are you thinking in japanese?
huh?
we want answers!
who are you?
and what did you do to us?
in the den...
the safe in the bookcase.
Ted, there's a safe in the bookcase.
No! Oh! Ah!
stop it! Stop it!
enough!
we're done.
we are not done!
I'm calling your bluff.
mom.
Ted...Ted! Put the gun down.
that's not gonna help anybody.
he killed my wife.
only fair I kill his.
and with his own gun too.
kinda poetic, don't you think?
tell him what he wants to know!
come on!
he's willing to kill us all.
leave her alone. She didn't do anything.
Claire, sit down.
shoot me if you're gonna shoot someone.
No!
Parkman, you have to trust me.
shoot Claire.
I'm telling you someone's going to die.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bennet.
shoot Claire now.
she can heal.
shoot me!
you brought this on yourself.
No!
no, no, no.
what did you do?!
no, no, no. Claire.
what did you do?!
what did you do that for?
get his trust.
now he knows how far we'll go.
right hook.
right hook coming.
bastard!
you killed my little girl!
you--you did!
tell me it's not true.
don't leave her here!
move Claire's body before it heals.
they don't need to see her like this.
we gotta move the body.
I had no idea it was gonna go this far.
believe me. He was going to kill your wife.
I actually heard him pull the trigger in his mind.
thank you for shooting first.
Oh my god.
Where's mom and lyle?
downstairs.
are they safe?
no. Wait, you made her indestructible?
I didn't make anyone.
you don't have all your facts straight and I don't appreciate your confusing my daughter.
the facts are you work at some freak factory where you ruin people's lives.
you've been mislead, Claire.
I will explain everything later.
but right now, you have to do exactly what I tell you to do.
I'm going to the police.
no, no, no. - Wait, wait.
do not make the same mistake I did.
don't put your family at risk.
Yeah, coming!
the people I work for don't know about you.
if they did, you wouldn't be here right now.
they would've taken you months ago and we never would've seen you again.
you said you want a normal life.
that's what I've been fighting for.
he's telling the truth.
hate me all you want, but right now, this has to be contained.
which means you have to stay put.
you want me to play dead?
I'm sorry. I'm not Mr. Muggles.
that man downstairs can generate a chain reaction which would be like dropping a nuclear bomb on this house.
and he'll do it too. Come on, we gotta go now.
just do what I say so nobody gets hurt. And you.
Yeah.
do what I think.
hey!- Enough!
no!- That's enough!
we already got their attention.
we're not gonna find anything here.
what we want is at the paper factory.
Really?- Yeah.
did he tell you that or think it?
there are records of the abductions--what they've done.
in exchange forhis family's safety, he'll get them for us.
I don't want anybody else to die because of what I've done to you.
do all words coming out of your mouth sound like lies?
he's not lying.
we'll have proof.
no surprises at the factory.
just the truth.
I'll stay with the family. You go.
no. I'll stay with the family.
I can do more damage here.
whatever you say. You're in control.
Sandra-- I'm gonna get us out of this.
it's 7: 00 am.
if you're not back in an hour, look for the mushroom cloud.
I think my wife suspects something.
she went through my bag.
she found a gun and a sedation kit.
that's a particular kind of stupid on your part for letting her find them.
I know, I know. The baby's been keeping me up for days.
it was sloppy.
I think Sandra thinks I'm some sort of a serial killer.
she's better off thinking you're a serial killer than knowing the truth.
I don't know what to do.
that a new sensation for you, Bennet?
is my wife in danger?
if I said yes, what would be your next move?
would pack up sSandra and little Claire and make a run for it or would you turn her over?
I'd do what I've always done.
what I'm told.
but you didn't answer the question.
is she in danger?
relax.
nothing's gonna happen to your wife because she's not gonna remember finding anything.
there's a boy we discovered in Haiti.
he can make her forget?
he's really something.
he's mute.
when we asked him about his ability, he drew a picture of himself pulling memories like little grub worms out of someone's head.
I want to put it on my fridge.
when he's done, make sure you thank him for saving Sandra's life.
she's upstairs.
we don't have time for this.
in about 38 minutes, Ted's going nuclear unless we bring him back some hard evidence.
the only thing we're bring Ted is a tranquilizer.
he deserves to know the truth.
he doesn't want the truth.
he wants his wife back.
short of that he wants revenge of the good old-fashioned biblical variety.
no, actually he doesn't.
you said yourself he already pulled the trigger in his mind.
okay, so that's it for him? What about me?
you gonna send me back to L.A. with my wife and my baby and no idea this ever happened so you can pretend to have a happy family again?
I'm not sending you anywhere.
you're the only one I can trust.
look, here's the deal.
I'll be honest with you.
you be honest with me.
you just try lying to me.
I just signaled the Haitian.
you said no one would know we're here.
until I needed them to.
guess who found out where I live.
what do you think we should do with him?
first, I have another "guess who."
guess who found out you can talk!
who have you been talking to?
who else knows about Claire?
just you and I.
but that will change.
she wasn't supposed to remember any of this.
I gave you specific instructions.
I answer to someone whose instructions supersede yours.
in this company?
in your daughter's life.
what's the mission?
looking into a security breech.
that's all I know.
that's all they told me.
that's all they told you to tell me.
but what you know is considerably more.
you're not as good a liar as you think.
you're the security breech.
is that what they're calling me behind my back?
I was hoping for something a bit more subtle or a pun at least.
you American are usually good for a pun.
is it true?
are you hiding one of them?
by "them," do you mean people like me?
is that what you're accusing me of hiding?
well, the short answer's yes, isn't it?
you compromised what we're doing.
sorry.
I mean, I know we're serving the greater good, but the vivisection started to keep me up at night.
seeing as you're raising one of us as you're own,
I was hoping for a bit more sympathy.
Claire's not one of you.
not yet.
but one day maybe.
and don't tell me you haven't thought about it.
if she is, then they'll take her. It's done.
Oh, just like that?
father of the year, you are.
I know who I work for.
so do I.
I was in your office when they told you to kill me.
then why'd you get in the car?
evidently, I think you're a better man than they do.
get out.
it's not the first time you've been told to kill a man, but is it the first time you've been told to kill a friend?
tell me who it is...
and we can forget about the rest.
you're just gonna do it?
you just gonna off me like nothing?
it's not nothing!
we find these people.
that's what we do. And you buried one.
you acted against the interest of the company.
you ever stop to think what those interests are?
who is it?
and what if it was Claire?
that's why you're so distant from her.
you know you're going to turn her in.
you're preparing for it.
you used to believe in what we do.
I used to believe in the tooth fairy.
we made a promise-- both of us.
I will not hunt my own people.
this isn't who you are.
you have a choice.
why couldn't you just-- Ah!
she's my daughter.
you can't be trusted to put her safety before company interests.
I've been hiding her for months.
that's the sort of thing that'll get you killed.
by someone like you.
but it hasn't made your daughter any safer.
we're running out of time and we're not exactly dealing with a patient man.
it's in Claire's best interest that we contain this and we keep her off the radar.
she could run.
she's safer in plain sight.
not at the moment.
no one is gonna be safe unless you give Ted what he wants.
thank you, god.
I prayed so hard.
thank you.
thank you, god.
I prayed so hard and you came back.
is it you? Is it really you?
go.
run, mom!
come on. Get outta here! Run!
go, mom!
mom!
you should've run.
I could never leave you, not after I just got you back.
I always thought you were a miracle.
didn't know how much of one until now.
I'm not a miracle, mom.
you were dead.
any time someone rises from the dead, I'd say that's a miracle.
I don't know what I am.
I don't know if god made me this way or someone else.
God didn't make us this way.
God makes us all the way we are.
I walked through fire and didn't get burned.
you were trying to tell me.
I was trying not to tell you.
all this forgetting...
why I was in the hospital...
you think your father did that to me?
I know he did.
he said he was trying to protect us.
he's your father.
he is coming back to get us out of this.
he's lied to you your entire marriage.
what makes you so sure he'll keep his word now?
faith.
what I've seen, what I've witnessed.
I can't pretend it's the same world it was yesterday.
God gave you a second chance.
find it in your heart to give your father one.
I'm curious about something.
did Parkman know when he shot you that you wouldn't die?
did your dad tell him that?
I don't know.
that explains why they were so chummy when they came down the stairs.
what do you supposed they're up to?
guess I'll just ask them myself.
am I still in control, Mr. Bennet?
you're still in control, Ted.
no tricks.
just what you asked for-- the truth.
we have what we want, Ted.
we have the proof.
then why the theatrics with shooting the girl who can't die?
it's better than shooting one who can.
we didn't come here to hurt anyone.
if the people who I work for found out that I've shown this to you, they will kill me.
since I'm risking my own life, I would rather not risk my family's.
do you want revenge or do you want the truth?
you can't have both.
I want the truth.
then let them go.
get them out of here.
what is he doing here?
just making sure my family's safe, that's all.
go, go, go.
dad!
yeah?
go!
come on, Claire. Let's go.
come on. Come on.
Lyle! - Mom! I called the police.
we didn't make you this way.
we took you three months ago...to identify you.
at the time, you were giving off low levels of radiation.
you were harmless.
you did nothing to stop it.
there's no cure.
we can't change the way you are.
the only choice is to kill you.
I wish you had.
it was my goal.
you had a life.
who was I to take it from you?
because you let me go, my wife is dead.
I'm sorry.
so am I.
no, don't!
you'll set him off!
you gotta stop it!
stop!
I can't!
we gotta get outta here!
No!
dad.
Where's my dad?
he's
Claire, don't!
dad!
get out!
not without you!
tranquilizer.
stay down!
I can't get close enough.
give it to me. I'll be okay. - No!
get him out of here!
go! Go!
go, go!
it's a good thing you called me when you did.
this sort of thing isn't taken lightly.
you know well and good what the policy is on hiding them.
I'm well aware.
it's a shame I have to kill another partner, especially one so useful to the cause.
has he been located?
the Haitian?
he must've figured you'd turn him in.
how long was he hiding claire?
in plain sight too.
you must feel like a fool.
I take it it's been months.
she trusted him over her own father.
surrogate father.
now that we have him, we'll keep sprague sedated.
find out what gives him his spark.
and then?
what do you think?
he was very helpful.
imagine working with someone like Parkman by your side.
knowing what everyone around you is thinking could prove quite resourceful.
certainly keep everybody honest.
she is one of them?
very promising.
she's gonna help us clean up the mess you made, we done here?
just one more thing.
when should we be expecting Claire?
I'll bring her in now.
why am I going?
I don't know.
will I see you again?
mom, lyle?
I don't know.
I wanted to protect you.
you're my dad.
I tried to be the best dad.
I couldn't.
I know.
see?
those are grandpa glasses.
Ouch.
even though I am the same age my father was when he needed glasses.
all right. How about these? Huh?
grandma glasses.
am I gonna need glasses too?
I don't know.
well, if you needed them and grandpa you needed them, won't I need them?
your mother and I were wondering when we were gonna have this conversation.
what's wrong? - No, no, nothing's wrong.
tell me.
I'm not your biological father.
you're adopted.
then who are my real parents.
we're your real parents.
we don't know who your biological family is but we're your real family.
how can you be my real family if I'm adopted?
well, what makes us real isn't where you come from.
It's...how much we love you.
and we love you very much.
I love you very much.
you didn't grow inside your mother.
you grew inside our hearts.
talk to me.
try these on.
how do I look?
like my dad.
this is good-bye.
you don't...have to do this.
there's gotta be another way.
this is the best way.
there can't be any doubt cast on your father.
right here.
two inches higher and I'm dead.
Claire, turn around. Cover your ears.
dad!
go deep.
take anything that would lead them to her.
I love you, dad.
I love you, Claire-bear.
to be continued...
Peter PETRELLI & ISSAC MENDEZ LOWER MANHATTAN
I thought she was you.
it was supposed to be you.
can't you do something?
she's dead.
it's your fault.
you did this.
you stop right there.
what is the problem?
I am here with tour from Osaka.
security just flagged you.
you must be some kind of cheat.
what?
you already got a warning.
and most people don't even get that.
it is okay.
I am invited now by Mr. Linderman.
well, in that case...
you can't stop me!
bigger men than you have tried.
I will find a way inside...
somehow.
it's all gone.
so you honestly don't remember anything?
I told you, I'm trying.
the last thing I remember is driving home from the hospital with my wife.
and after that, it's just-- it's...
gray.
blank.
so sprague and parkman taking your family hostage.
shooting your daughter.
a bullet clean through your side.
you'd think something there might have made an impression.
my daughter is missing.
so right now, I don't care if you believe me, or what you do to me.
I just want her home, safe.
you can kill me if you want.
I'm gonna find her!
settle down.
you'll tear your new stitches if you're not careful.
well, clearly, your partner's gone rogue, taken a pie slice of your memory with him.
he did the same thing to your wife and son.
they remember even less.
when can I go after them?
sorry.
I can't let that be your errand.
she's my daughter.
she's an assignment.
or have you forgotten?
we gave her to you.
took her out of a bassinet, put her in your hands, and told you to take her home.
and that's after you said," no, thank you."
now, I appreciate you taking an interest in her beyond the needs of the assignment, but...
that indulgence ends now.
you expect me to do nothing?
I expect you to do whatever we ask of you.
well, what do we think?
he's telling the truth.
he doesn't know anything.
cool.
you owe me five bucks.
come on. - Wait.
we had a deal.
I help you out, you let me go.
take it easy, Parkman.
we'll get there.
what?
hey...
Hey!
you have not said anything all day.
I thought you'd prefer it.
it's not like you'd tell me where we're going anyway.
as soon as I know where we're going, I will tell you.
when can I go back to my family?
should I lie to you, and say it will be soon?
you know what to run from.
Yeah, the people you and my dad work for.
what they will do, not even you can recover from.
great.
Thanks, dad.
you cannot understand the level of sacrifice he made so you might live.
you must honor that.
is it safe to go back?
no.
we leave the country tonight.
sorry, Mr. Petrelli, these men wanted to see you.
they're from the-- FBI.
I'm federal agent Quesada.
this is agent Alonzo.
we'd like to speak with you concerning illegal campaign contributions you may have received from the Linderman group.
the FBI is curious why the las Vegas-based Linderman group would be so interested in helping a New York candidate.
my father served as an in-house attorney for the group before he passed away.
it's all right.
we're clear-- no one's listening.
you agreed there'd be no face to face.
and you agreed to deliver Linderman.
I'm the one who brought you in here, remember?
I'd appreciate a little discretion, as opposed to a surprise office visit.
no one outside this office knows you're working with us.
Linderman's requested a meeting with you at his casino tonight.
any guesses why?
I'm still four points behind.
he's gonna tell me how he plans to put me ahead, and what's expected of me after I win.
Yeah, we were thinking the same thing.
and we want you to record it.
you want me to wear a wire?
you're the only one on our side who can get enough incriminating evidence to put him behind bars.
we need this, Mr. Petrelli.
and so do you.
otherwise, he walks.
we'll contact you when you land in Vegas.
how long have you been working with the FBI?
since Heidi's accident.
I'm gonna take Linderman down for a long time, peter.
I thought I could be a hero and save the world.
instead, I just killed - what's that?
that's not your blood, is it?
no.
Simone.
isaac shot her.
she's dead.
she's dead.
did you call the police?
no.
okay, here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna make an anonymous phone call. Okay?
you'll have had absolutely nothing to do with it.
but I did.
she's dead because of me.
I don't-- I don't know what to do.
that's just it, you don't do anything.
do you understand?
this is not the time for you to get noble.
okay? Just stay with me.
I can't.
I can't.
as long as I'm alive, everyone around me is in danger.
we can call Suresh, okay?
he can study you.
he can-- he's working on a cure.
isn't it too late for that?
wait.
sir, you have your flight to Vegas.
just tell the driver to wait.
Oh, there you are.
Lyle's watching pay-per-view in the other room.
I'm gonna run to the gym before there's an elipto line.
I tell you, that flood in our basement has turned into a right vacation for this family.
too bad claire's missing it all with that cheerleading retreat.
Oh, I'm not gonna answer that.
I've got the dog hotel giving me hourly updates on Mr. Muggles-- they hate me.
sorry, I have to take a trip.
now?
what else?
you stay here and take care of lyle.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
if anyone comes looking for me
stop, you can't go.
what are you doing?
why are you whispering?
because you told me to yesterday.
I thought you didn't remember anything about yesterday.
you told me to pretend that that man took my memory.
you took me in the shower, you told me everything.
I told you?
what you really do, who you work for, and what happened to claire.
do you know where she is?
you know I can't remember.
no.
but you told me you were protecting her.
you said you sent her away so she'd be safe.
and that if you went after her, I should give you this.
Claire's with friends. Don't go after her.
this is my writing.
all right, look, we can't let anybody know about this.
don't worry, I know how to play dumb.
I could never love you enough.
you do fine.
Puccini?
I thought of you more as a John Denver type.
that your wife?
your painter friend from new york tried to reach you.
I chatted with him for you.
apparently, he's got himself a dead girlfriend.
nice guy.
thompson doesn't need me on this one.
I need to be here with my family.
this isn't a request.
this is an assignment.
you do remember assignments, don't you?
I'll get my things.
let me guess.
another paper emergency.
huge order mix-up in Fresno.
sorry for stealing your husband, mrs. Bennet.
it's just the he's the best guy we've got in a pinch.
I like your hair.
so this is the list?
Yes.
what's left of it.
most of the people are missing, or dead.
I want to run your dna sample against my father's formula, and then take you someplace safe.
but this is your father's formula.
this is how he made the list, how he found me.
Yes, although I haven't figured out what it is looking for.
I mean, a specific gene, codons?
there are three billion base pairs in human dna.
it's a proverbial needle.
did my dna help?
no.
okay, well, mohinder, you've been driving all night.
why don't you just take a break?
I can't. These people are in danger.
we have to warn them.
if Sylar gets to them first exactly. So let me help.
I mean, here...
this one is in new york.
isaac Mendez-- I'll call him.
and you just relax.
just take a minute.
you're very kind.
Zane, thank you.
you have no idea how alone I used to feel.
how insignificant.
you've given me hope.
hope is great.
we need caffeine.
so this formula, if you figure it out, how many of us will you find?
who knows?
hundreds, thousands, maybe more.
no.
it's busy.
I'll get him later.
to new friends.
this is good. What is it?
it's a special blend my father brought from india.
who are we going to call next?
no one.
I already have you...
Mr. Sylar.
Hiro?
Mr. Petrelli? - Yeah.
flying man!
not here.
flying man!
Yeah.
let me guess, you're still trying to steal that sword for mr. Linderman?
Where's your friend?
Ando?
I sent him back to Japan.
this mission getting too dangerous for him.
I think I know what you mean.
you can't protect everyone, right?
sometimes it's better to go it alone.
the more people you try and help-- the more people get hurt.
Yeah.
please, you must help me.
I can't get past casino security giant.
when I first met you, I thought you were nuts.
it's okay.
I thought you were mean.
but now I know you pretend you do not care about anyone.
but you care too much.
it's really important to you to get your powers back, huh?
it is important for everyone.
well, follow me.
you know who I am?
of course, Mr. Petrelli.
my friend here is making a delivery from me to mr. Linderman.
something he's expecting.
I didn't realize... you look like you've been around long enough to know what happens when Mr. Linderman doesn't get something he's expecting?
or do I have to paint you a picture?
he can take it to the curator.
does that work for you?
my name is vivian, and I'm from canada?!
are you kidding me?
I do not need you happy.
only safe.
there's nothing left of me.
everything I am is gonna disappear the second I get on that plane.
my friends, my family...
me.
I can make you forget it all, if that's what you would prefer.
there's nothing left for you here.
no one to trust.
no, you cannot see him again.
Peter petrelli is the only person I know I can trust.
more than you.
he cares about me.
why can't I hide in new york with him?
he's not in a position to be responsible, for you or himself.
come.
boarding pass and I. D.
boarding pass, I.D.
boarding pass and I. D.
sorry, sir, only ticketed passengers are allowed beyond this point.
isaac Mendez, NYPD.
we have a few questions for you.
Mr. Mendez?
detective jeff tracy, nypd.
do you know this woman-- simone deveaux?
she and I, we broke up recently.
we received an anonymous phone call that she might be hurt.
some of your neighbors said they heard an argument, and gunshots.
mind if we take a look around?
what's going on?
something wrong?
no, ma'am, apparently not.
sorry for taking your time.
Simone, you're alive.
lucky you.
my...
you're very useful.
Candice is special, just like you.
then simone's-- she's traveling europe, indefinitely, as far as the rest of the world is concerned.
there's a crew coming to clean up this mess.
how am I supposed to pretend this didn't happen?
maybe you should have thought about that before you shot her twice.
what's the matter, sweetie?
you want to shoot me again?
enough.
I can't stay here.
take me with you.
that's not our assignment.
please.
I don't know what to do.
of course you do.
you keep painting.
my condolences.
here we go.
when did you get so good?
I'm unemployed.
what do you think I do all day when you're at school?
one more?
I can't. I'm gonna be late for the bus.
so be late.
you're not gonna learn anything at school that you don't already know.
love you.
you know, you have to admit it, Niki.
I do a better you than you.
did you think I wouldn't find out?
about what?
Where'd you get that?
it was on my pillow.
well, I didn't put it there.
were you digging through my stuff?
don't turn this around on me, Niki.
you said no more secrets.
now I find out you're going to Linderman's casino.
for what?
what's he got you doing with this guy?
it's nothing.
Linderman called, and he asked me to be a dealer.
that's it.
you know you're not talking about just dealing cards here.
that's all this is.
baby, trust me.
I promise you I won't do anything that I don't want to.
you left that for him, didn't you?
cute.
I can't feel my fingers.
it's the curare.
it induces paralysis of the brain.
which means you can't control your abilities.
whoever you think I am, I'm not.
you are the man who murdered my father.
do you still expect me to believe you're zane taylor?
Zane was killed three days ago.
the same day I met you.
and you thought you were so clever giving me his dna.
you're a parasite.
you killed my father and fed off his work.
let me hear you say it.
tell me your name!
say it!
I want to hear you say it!
there's only one thing to do with a parasite.
kill it before it kills again.
you're just like your father-- murderers, the both of you.
I'm a scientist.
your father said that, but he kept leading me to them.
he had no idea what you were.
he knew.
he might not have admitted it, but after all, we were making so much progress together, why would he stop?
you know nothing about my father!
I know everything.
he confided in me.
he told me things he felt he could never tell you.
things about your sister...
he thought you were too--what's the word-- fragile to know the truth.
that's why he liked me.
you were always seeking his approval, while I provided stimulation.
he gave up on you, but he adored me.
now who's the real parasite here?!
you're right.
my father did want answers.
he called you patient zero.
you're the template he used to create this formula.
you're the key to unlocking his secret.
as much as I'd like to, killing you will not give me what I need.
so what are you gonna do?
I'm going to take a sample of your spinal fluid.
and it's going to hurt.
you might actually do some good before you die.
there are so few dead sea fragments left in the world.
it would be a pity if you crushed this one.
so many things.
you brought the new mendez?
this one is very special.
this painting is ripped...
and repaired with scotch tape.
Yes, very special.
is there something else?
I need receipt-o for delivery.
there are 754 members of the security team in this hotel.
all of them with the instructions to drop what they're doing, and come running if I push this button.
security code orange activated.
that sword you thought you'd steal, do you even realize who it belonged to?
Takezo Kensei.
he was a hero.
security, sir.
this man tried to steal from mr. Linderman.
Hiro.
Ando! How did you.
I knew you'd set off an alarm eventually.
I've been following you.
what about the other 753 members of security?
the big guy says linderman's gonna be, uh, asking for me in about an hour.
I'm not in the mood for craps, so I'm gonna go straight to my room.
I guess it's hard to look natural when you're going after the whale.
maybe he'll chat up a few more japanese tourists.
where the hell is that pizza?
Hi, agent Alonzo.
quesada.
Mr. Linderman sends his regards.
and a suggestion.
don't run surveillance on a man from inside his own hotel.
it's really tacky.
kick over your guns.
down.
it's so much easier working with professionals.
I finally found it.
that's it, these four simple genes, they answer everything.
now, I-- I can make a new list.
I can find them, save them.
and what about me?
don't I deserve to be saved?
aren't I just a victim too?
I didn't ask for this.
and what would you have me do?
help find a way.
give me salvation.
give me that damn list so I can sink my teeth in!
I'm a natural progression of the species.
evolution is a part of nature, and nature kills.
simple, right?
what you've done is not evolution, it's murder.
what I am doing is revenge.
now I can fulfill my duty as a son.
I wasn't begging for my life.
I was offering you yours.
you are your father's son.
so determined, you didn't even notice I stopped the IV.
but don't worry, you might actually do some good before you die.
starting with that list.
I'm back in my room.
I'll be on the floor in an hour.
wearing this could get a person killed.
okay, it's all right.
easy. - Listen to me.
I don't know how much time we have before she comes back.
who?
the woman that they sent after you.
you picked the wrong day to screw with me.
Linderman knows about the wire, and the fbi you know the fbi can hear everything we're saying.
no, they can't-- they're dead.
Linderman knows that you turned on him.
did you come here to kill me...
or warn me?
just trust me.
well, you're back early.
Hey, good news.
I convinced the hotel to let us keep Mr. Muggles in the room.
that is good news.
I've been going out of my head thinking everybody's watching me, waiting for me to make a mistake.
did you find her?
no, I can't do that.
if I know where she is, they can extract it from me.
but I need you to be strong a little while longer.
we both have to pretend that we have no idea what happened so claire will be safe.
but the company - has to be stopped.
for good.
that's the only way to make sure that claire will stay safe.
I didn't know that I could talk to you like this.
I always just thought that you'd be so furious at me for all the lies and deceit.
right now, we just have to take care of claire.
we'll talk about us later.
must be the kennel.
hello.
Yes, it is.
Yes, he is going to be a problem.
why don't we do it right now?
sorry.
I did it!
don't worry about me.
you must go! you hace the sword.
you can teleport out of here.
No!
come, we both go.
both?
Oh no.
this looks like.
what happened?
it's the future.
the bomb.
we didn't stop it.
I failed.
I'm sorry, I hope I have the right address.
I'm looking for Peter Petrelli.
you picked a terrible time to do that.
Peter's not here just now.
you may as well come inside, claire.
who are you?
I'm your grandmother.
and I've been trying to protect you, but you haven't made that very easy.
quite stubborn, aren't you?
just like your father.
Linderman hired her to kill the fbi and keep you in line.
who?
let's just say I owe her.
he's gonna offer you a deal.
if you go in there, you have to take it.
spend the rest of my life with his boot on my neck?
no, thank you.
then run.
get your family, and run.
you said that you had kids.
two boys?
I can't do that.
you don't have any other option.
Yeah, I do.
I could kill him.
knock me out.
Why?
so that jessica knows she's not in control anymore.
who is jessica?
you want this gun?
do it.
not up there.
Mr. Linderman won't be meeting you in his office.
Mr. Linderman.
do you enjoy vegetables, mr. Petrelli?
I've been known to eat zucchini when the mood strikes, but not as a rule.
you know, you can probably hire someone to do that for you.
Oh, yeah?
I like to cook-- it's my meditation.
one aims for perfection in one's life, but one doesn't find it very often.
for me, this is about as close as it gets.
voila!
a pot pie.
wholesome, warm, healthy.
that's, of course if you can live without the cream sauce.
personally, I can'T.
I mean, what's the point?
you know, people can sleep, or they can gamble.
or they can even make love when they're miserable.
but I think that most people eat when they're happy.
I like to see people happy.
are you happy, Nathan?
not especially.
I guess I have a few issues that plague me.
Oh, dear, I'm sorry to hear that.
you see, I think there comes a time when a man has to ask himself whether he wants a life of happiness or a life of meaning.
I'd like to have both.
it can't be done.
two very different paths.
I mean, to be truly happy a man must live absolutely in the present, and with no thought of what's gone before, and no thought of what lies ahead.
but a life of meaning, a man is condemned to wallow in the past, and obsess about the future.
my guess is that you've done quite a bit of obsessing about yours these last few days.
now you can't have any of my pot pie.
I won't hold it against you.
lots of men have tried to kill me.
then I'll be the last.
of course, you can pull that trigger, Nathan.
you'd be taking both of our lives.
you'll be dead within moments.
or I could offer you something.
I'm not interested in anything you have to offer me.
I think you are.
I think there are things you need to hear.
things that I know about.
too late for that.
that you can fly, for instance?
or about your brother Peter.
and his small problem.
your daughter, even.
and all those others out there like you.
I can offer you more than just information, Nathan.
you're gonna win your election.
I'll see to that.
and two years from now, through a series of fluke circumstances, you will find yourself in the white house.
a heartbeat away from the presidency.
a life of meaning, Nathan.
think about it.
the choice is yours.
it's Peter Petrelli.
I remember you.
you're like me, aren't you?
I'd like to see how that works.
to BE CONTINUED...
where does it come from?
this quest?
this need to solve life's mysteries when the simplest of questions can never be answered.
why are we here?
what is the soul?
why do we dream?
perhaps we'd be better off not looking at all.
not delving, not yearning.
but that's not human nature, not the human heart.
that is not why we are here.
yet sill we struggle to make a difference, to change the world, to dream of hope.
never knowing for certain who we will meet along the way.
who among the world of strangers will hold our hand.
touch our hearts.
Kirby Plaza Building New York City
and share the pain of trying.
you don't love him.
everything I've done, I did for them.
No!
you should've taken the money.
why did you take that bullet?
you could've let it phase right through you.
it's okay. - Go.
forget about me.
save Micah.
you can get us out of here.
you can walk us through this wall.
I don't know if I can.
you have to do this.
you can do this.

what does he want?
what am I thinking now, Parkman?
your last thought.
lower your gun.
shoot me and she dies.
as long as she's alive, my daughter will never be safe.
none of them will.
you'll take the life of one little girl to save another?
if I have to.
taking her life would save thousands.
and Thompson?
did you save thousands of lives by killing him?
no, just my own.
officer Parkman?
you know this man?
I told you he was coming.
he promised to keep me safe.
that's right.
and nobody is gonna hurt you.
Jettetsu Arms New York City
Ando must have thought I would give up.
he took a sword and went after Sylar!
alone!
he'll die!
Yes. Probably.
but that's not your concern right now.
you must remember your mission.
the world is at stake.
no,
I must go after him.
I will not abandon my friend!
then you have already lost.
father.
my whole life you have looked at me with disappointment.
I do not wish to lose you now.
but I cannot let my friend die.
not when I have the power to stop it.
Nakamura Hiro.
don't forget your legacy...
the wind at the back of history.
I challenge everyone here tonight to inspire by example.
Nathan Petrelli's office New York City To fight the battle, no matter the cost.
the world is sick, spinning out of control.
but we can heal it.
Patty and the boys should be landing in Nantucket any minute.
chopper's gonna meet us up on the roof in an hour.
what is it, Ma?
it's Linderman. He's dead.
how?
someone got to him in his office. He was murdered.
this is a terrible tragedy, Nathan.
Yes, it is.
but it doesn't change anything. The plan wasn't just his.
you know that, Congressman.
Yeah.
after the explosion, the city is gonna need me, Ma.
america's gonna need me.
the world.
this changes nothing.
42, Micah's on this floor.
you go. I'm only gonna slow you down.
I'm not leaving you. You'll die if I do.
I can't go with you, Nik.
you have to do this alone.
you have to find Micah.
I can't. - You can.
you were strong enough. You always have been.
I'm coming back for you.
you stay right here, you understand me?
Linderman's guards will be all over us if they find Thompson's body.
maybe you should've thought of that before you shot him.
it was self-defense.
and Molly Walker?
what's your excuse for nearly shooting her?
she's dangerous.
you're gonna need to start trusting me, Dr. Suresh.
Yes, because that's worked out really well for me before.
look...
the organization that I used to work for once stood for something.
Now...it's been corrupted.
used to work for?
the only thing that's important to me now is protecting my family.
I will never let Molly be used to hurt anyone.
she can do good in this world.
I don't think you understand the true nature of this organization.
and you don't understand how important she is to me.
it was my antibodies that saved her.
I'm responsible for her life.
Hey, there's something wrong with Molly.
Hello? - Dad.
Claire, where are you?
still in New York.
I'm with Peter, but there's a problem.
Ted Sprague's dead.
Sylar killed him.
dad?
put Peter on the phone, please.
he wants to talk to you.
hello.
when you came into contact with Ted, you absorbed his power.
that's right.
well, now that Sylar's absorbed it too,
I think you may be the only one who can stop him.
now all we have to do is find him.
any idea where we start?
there's a tracking system here.
we're trying to fix it now.
as soon as we do, we'll find him.
and if you don't?
you just stay close to Claire's phone. Okay?
I'll contact you the second we have a location.
and whatever you do...
you keep Claire safe.
you understand?
Yeah.
what are we doing here?
I actually believed you.
you lied to me.
you said you weren't gonna call him.
Yeah, I know, but think about it, Claire.
we can't do this alone.
no, you think about it.
we can't trust him.
Yes, we can trust him.
Nathan has never let me down.
Nathan doesn't care about you.
he doesn't care about anyone.
he doesn't care about me, and I'm his own daughter.
we do not need him!
Yes, we do!
Why? - Because I'm afraid, okay?
and I need my brother to help us.
you lied to me, Peter.
I trusted you.
what's the emergency?
the bomb.
it's not me, it's Sylar.
he killed Ted Sprague, which means he's radioactive. And if he explodes...
look...I know that this is a lot to process, but it is real, I swear.
and I don't have a lot of time to find him.
what do you want me to do?
I don't know. Just...help me.
come here.
look, if what you're saying is real, then there's no reason to involve Claire in this.
it's just too dangerous.
no, she has to stay with me.
she's just a kid, Pete.
if I find Sylar and I'm able to stop him, then she's the only one who can stop me if something goes wrong.
you're gonna be fine.
how do you know?
you told me you-- you could regenerate, that you could survive.
there's nothing you can do to stop it, Peter.
they're all gonna die.
what is it?
Claire was right about you.
what are you talking about?
God, no.
no, no, no, no!
this isn't happening.
how much longer before she's up and running?
she's not a machine.
I just gave her the transfusion.
it'll take some time.
well, take too much time, and the city will pay for it.
Sylar's out there.
you mean the boogeyman?
don't try to get up.
I can do it.
I can tell you where he is.
okay. So...how do we do this?
I just...
I think about him in my mind, then I point to him on the map there.
I need a push pin.
so you can find anyone in the world?
you just need to think about them?
almost anyone.
almost?
there's only one that I can't.
who's that?
is it someone bad, Molly, like the boogeyman?
no.
he's a lot worse.
and why don't you want to find him?
cause when I think about him... he can see me.
Molly...can you think about Sylar now?
he's there.
that's the Lower East Side.
somewhere around Reed Street.
Isaac's loft.
the painter?
who?
I've gotta call Peter.
why don't you let me answer that for you.
hello.
Claire? - No, this is her grandmother.
where is she?
where she belongs, with her family.
dad!
I'm her family.
no, you're the man we gave her to to look after, to keep safe.
a job you haven't done particularly well.
what are you gonna do with her?
take her someplace far enough to keep her out of harm's way.
I suggest you do the same.
there isn't much time.
let me say goodbye to her.
dad.
are you okay? - Yeah.
I'm just trying to get away from these people.
no, no.
you're better off going with them.
What?!
she's right.
you shouldn't be here.
but as soon as you're safe out of the city, you try and get away.
do you understand?
Yeah.
I need to find Peter.
where is he?
I don't know. They won't tell me.
that's long enough, dear.
tell me you have a plan, Dad.
I have a plan.
I love you, Claire.
I love you too.
we have a new priority. Peter Petrelli. We have to find him.
what for?
we know where Sylar is. We can go after him.
no, not without Petrelli.
he's the only one who can stop him.
I've come 3, 000 miles.
I left my pregnant wife at home.
he's a bad guy. I'm a cop. I'm going after him.
then he will kill you.
Yeah, we'll see.
there you are, sir.
thank you.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm Peter. I'm your father's new nurse.
Yes, I've heard.
I'm Simone Deveaux.
nice to meet you.
your mother seems to know my father somehow.
Yeah, she's, uh... yeah, she's, uh-- sorry.
Yeah, my mother, she's-- she's full of surprises.
I want to thank you for this.
I know it's a real hard job.
dying is hard.
what I do, it's just... I'm here to help.
no, you're a real hero to care for a perfect stranger like this.
this may sound strange, but...
your father's last few weeks, his death...
it could be beautiful if you let it be.
sure, a piece of cake.
I'm not saying it's not tragic for you.
I'm just saying...
you know, death is the one thing that connects us all.
reminds us that's what really important is who we've touched, and...
you know, how much we've given.
makes us realize that...we have to be good to one another.
see, your father... he's the real hero.
not me.
come on, I'll show you the apartment.
get you settled in.
believe me, if he knew, you'd know,
there's a look you just can't hide when it first shows.
what about Nathan?
Linderman tells me Nathan will be ready to play his part.
well, he's been wrong before.
meaning what exactly?
I think that Linderman is betting on the wrong brother.
we talking about the same Peter here?
I look in Peter's eyes, I see compassion, empathy.
but most of all, I see hope.
this world won't be saved on strength.
what it really needs is heart, and that's Peter.
Charles, don't get me wrong.
I love Peter, but that poor kid can barely get out of his own way.
he's ruled by insecurities.
he's weak.
no, trust me.
this bomb is going to go off.
and Nathan is going to be the one the world turns to.
I don't believe this tragedy's inevitable.
well, then...one of us is going to be right.
and one of us won't.
well, I'm glad I won't be alive to see which one that is.
you are in my prayers, Charles.
I could use them.
good-bye, my dear, dear friend.
I know you're there, Peter.
isaac MENDEZ'S LOFT NEW YORK CITY
hmm, looks like you dropped something.
a comic book that predicts the future.
what will they think of next?
you're kidding.
this is how Isaac thought I'd die? Stabbed by a silly little man!
Hiro is not silly.
you should've seen the look on his face when he tried to kill me.
you cannot take my brain. - Please.
what would I want with your brain?
where is Peter Petrelli? - I don't know.
where is he
let him go.
I don't think I'm going to.
I'm okey.
I'm here to save you,
all you have to do is stop time before I cut off his head.
do you think you can do your little trick before I can do mine?
don't worry about me!
just stab him!
you can't be here. - Look what you did.
Oh, my God! Micah.
it's all your fault, Niki.
D. L.now Micah.
they're both gone... because you were weak.
Micah, please.
the wrong sister died. It should've been you.
face it, Niki. You're nothing.
I'm the one they needed.
Molly, we need to go now.
where are we going?
officer Parkman called.
he believes that Sylar-- he believe the boogeyman is on his way.
no. He's not on his way.
he's already here.
I have to get some paperwork.
I'm not gonna be coming back to my office.
helicopter's picking us up from the roof in ten minutes.
when the jet lands tomorrow morning, you'll be safe.
but everyone else will be dead.
how can you do nothing to stop this?
it's inevitable, dear. There's nothing anyone can do about it.
that's insane!
nothing is inevitable. The future is not written in stone.
I'm afraid this one is.
if everything is so inevitable, then why has she been trying to keep us apart all these years?
there are things you simply aren't mature enough to understand yet.
Yeah, like how you can let your own son die like this.
your own brother.
he's not gonna die.
thanks to you, Peter has the ability to survive.
so he lives... and kills millions of people.
how can you let him be responsible for something like that?
and how can you live with yourself if he is?
Claire, I know that it's hard for you to trust me right now.
but this is all gonna make sense very soon.
I promise.
we're offering you everything you've ever wanted, Claire.
a place to belong. A family.
I already have a family.
No!
I know what you're thinking, Nathan.
let her go. You understand.
how many times have I saved your ass?
I'm the only reason that you're still alive.
that's not me. Stop her.
find Micah. - What?
I said stop her. That's not me.
I'm not strong enough.
who the hell are you talking to?
mom? - Micah?
mom, I'm in here! It's locked!
mom.
is it really you?
it's me, baby.
it's just me.
he could be a bad guy.
he needs my help.
okay, we need to get him out of here.
it's not working.
they've must have shut it down.
okay, I need a lookout. Can you do that?
stand over here and keep an eye out.
if anyone comes, tell me straight away.
YAMAGATO Industries, Tokyo, Japan
Hiro, You did it!
you were faster than sylar.
now I'll go back.
we can go back together, surprise him!
no, Ando!
this part of my journey...
I must finish alone.
but...I am not afraid.
I know.
you have shown me what bravery is.
your whole life you talked about your favorite stories...
star wars, star trek, superman, Kensei...
all the heroes you wanted to be.
one day, people will tell the story of...
Hiro Nakamura.
so you'll know I'll be back.
But...your sword?
it is not the sword. it is the man.
the man is ready.
Hiro...
you look bad ass.
Really?
invisibility.
always thought that that would be a good one to have.
I don't understand. How is this happening?
you're alive.
is this a dream?
am I time traveling?
are you doing this?
doesn't really matter what it is, does it?
only that you're here now.
Yeah, but I saw you speaking to my mother. You know about the bomb.
you know about everything.
you came here because you needed to.
you needed to hear the truth before you could save the world.
I save the world?
you've had the power all along, Peter.
you just needed to learn how to use it.
why me?
because there has to be one that's good.
there always has.
and your heart has the ability to love unconditionally.
like I told you.
in the end, all that really matters...is love.
I'm tired now.
let's get you your rest then, sir.
call me Charles.
Peter! Wake up, wake up!
I must've blacked out.
how did you find me?
I told you. We have a tracking system.
and where's Claire?
she's safe. She's with your mother.
my mother? - Yeah.
they're on their way out of the city right now.
okay, you need to leave too.
I don't think I can control this. - No, I'm staying with you.
you saved my daughter's life.
I told you I owed you for that.
consider this payback.
Yeah, but if I can't stop Sylar, if I lose it, I could
I'll put you down myself.
don't worry. I'm a pretty good shot.
thank you, Mr. Bennet.
call me Noah.
come on.
the guards are coming.
dad!
Micah? We have to go.
it won't work. - Yes, it will.
come on! DL
come on, dad!
you know, it doesn't look like there's many places to hide.
you sure about this tracking system?
he's here. Don't worry.
look, all right, then that means he's hiding in plain sight.
what took you so long?
haven't I killed you before?
didn't take.
you think I'm gonna let you ruin it all?
take all the glory?
let's go!
did you really think you could stop me?
mom, Dad needs your help!
go back to your family. I've got this.
wait, no!
turns out you're the villain, Peter.
I'm the hero.
you.
Ya-ta.
Hiro! - Peter Petrelli!
you can stop this.
how?
I need you to kill me.
do it.
do it, Claire, you are the only one.
tell me there's another way, please.
shoot me.
there is no other way.
Yes, there is, Claire.
the future isn't written in stone.
I took his power, Nathan.
I can't control it.
I can't do anything.
I'm not leaving you, Peter.
there's another way to end this, and you know it.
I can't let you die.
and I can't let everyone else.
you saved the cheerleader... so we could save the world.
I love you, Nathan.
I love you too.
you ready?
what happened to them?
wait!
please don't die, Officer Parkman.
you're my hero.
we dream of hope. We dream of change.
of fire, of love, of death.
and then it happens.
the dream becomes real.
and the answer to this quest, this need to solve life's mysteries finally shows itself.
like the glowing light of a new dawn.
let's go home.
Hmph. Home where? Our house burned down.
home is anywhere our family is together.
you've got a plan, right?
so much struggle for meaning, for purpose.
and in the end, we find it only in each other.
our shared experience of the fantastic.
and the mundane.
the simple human need to find a kindred. To connect.
and to know in our hearts...
that we are not alone.
generations
outside Kyoto, Japan, 1671
where does it come from?
this quest?
this need to solve life's mysteries when the simplest of questions can never be answered.
why are we here?
what is the soul?
why do we dream?
perhaps we'd be better off not looking at all.
not delving, not yearning.
but that's not human nature, not the human heart.
that is not why we are here.
yet sill we struggle to make a difference, to change the world, to dream of hope.
never knowing for certain who we will meet along the way.
who among the world of strangers will hold our hand.
touch our hearts.
and share the pain of trying.
you don't love him.
everything I've done, I did for them.
No!
you should've taken the money.
why did you take that bullet?
you could've let it phase right through you.
it's okay. - Go.
forget about me.
save Micah.
you can get us out of here.
you can walk us through this wall.
I don't know if I can.
you have to do this.
you can do this.
surveillance picked them upin the elevator.
what does he want?
what am I thinking now, Parkman?
your last thought.
lower your gun.
shoot me and she dies.
as long as she's alive, my daughter will never be safe.
none of them will.
you'll take the life of one little girl to save another?
if I have to.
taking her life would save thousands.
and Thompson?
did you save thousands of lives by killing him?
no, just my own.
officer Parkman?
you know this man?
I told you he was coming.
he promised to keep me safe.
that's right.
and nobody is gonna hurt you.
Ando must have thought I would give up.
he took a sword and went after Sylar!
alone!
he'll die!
Yes. Probably.
but that's not your concern right now.
you must remember your mission.
the world is at stake.
no,
I must go after him.
I will not abandon my friend!
then you have already lost.
father.
my whole life you have looked at me with disappointment.
I do not wish to lose you now.
but I cannot let my friend die.
not when I have the power to stop it.
don't forget your legacy...
the wind at the back of history.
I challenge everyone here tonight to inspire by example.
Nathan Petrelli's office New York City To fight the battle, no matter the cost.
the world is sick, spinning out of control.
but we can heal it.
Patty and the boys should be landing in Nantucket any minute.
chopper's gonna meet us up on the roof in an hour.
what is it, Ma?
it's Linderman. He's dead.
how?
someone got to him in his office. He was murdered.
this is a terrible tragedy, Nathan.
Yes, it is.
but it doesn't change anything. The plan wasn't just his.
you know that, Congressman.
Yeah.
after the explosion, the city is gonna need me, Ma.
america's gonna need me.
the world.
this changes nothing.
42, Micah's on this floor.
you go. I'm only gonna slow you down.
I'm not leaving you. You'll die if I do.
I can't go with you, Nik.
you have to do this alone.
you have to find Micah.
I can't. - You can.
you were strong enough. You always have been.
I'm coming back for you.
you stay right here, you understand me?
Linderman's guards will be all over us if they find Thompson's body.
maybe you should've thought of that before you shot him.
it was self-defense.
and Molly Walker?
what's your excuse for nearly shooting her?
she's dangerous.
you're gonna need to start trusting me, Dr. Suresh.
Yes, because that's worked out really well for me before.
look...
the organization that I used to work for once stood for something.
Now...it's been corrupted.
used to work for?
the only thing that's important to me now is protecting my family.
I will never let Molly be used to hurt anyone.
she can do good in this world.
I don't think you understand the true nature of this organization.
and you don't understand how important she is to me.
it was my antibodies that saved her.
I'm responsible for her life.
Hey, there's something wrong with Molly.
Hello? - Dad.
Claire, where are you?
still in New York.
I'm with Peter, but there's a problem.
Ted Sprague's dead.
Sylar killed him.
dad?
put Peter on the phone, please.
he wants to talk to you.
hello.
when you came into contact with Ted, you absorbed his power.
that's right.
well, now that Sylar's absorbed it too,
I think you may be the only one who can stop him.
now all we have to do is find him.
any idea where we start?
there's a tracking system here.
we're trying to fix it now.
as soon as we do, we'll find him.
and if you don't?
you just stay close to Claire's phone. Okay?
I'll contact you the second we have a location.
and whatever you do...
you keep Claire safe.
you understand?
Yeah.
what are we doing here?
I actually believed you.
you lied to me.
you said you weren't gonna call him.
Yeah, I know, but think about it, Claire.
we can't do this alone.
no, you think about it.
we can't trust him.
Yes, we can trust him.
Nathan has never let me down.
Nathan doesn't care about you.
he doesn't care about anyone.
he doesn't care about me, and I'm his own daughter.
we do not need him!
Yes, we do!
Why? - Because I'm afraid, okay?
and I need my brother to help us.
you lied to me, Peter.
I trusted you.
what's the emergency?
the bomb.
it's not me, it's Sylar.
he killed Ted Sprague, which means he's radioactive. And if he explodes...
look...I know that this is a lot to process, but it is real, I swear.
and I don't have a lot of time to find him.
what do you want me to do?
I don't know. Just...help me.
come here.
look, if what you're saying is real, then there's no reason to involve Claire in this.
it's just too dangerous.
no, she has to stay with me.
she's just a kid, Pete.
if I find Sylar and I'm able to stop him, then she's the only one who can stop me if something goes wrong.
you're gonna be fine.
how do you know?
you told me you-- you could regenerate, that you could survive.
there's nothing you can do to stop it, Peter.
they're all gonna die.
what is it?
Claire was right about you.
what are you talking about?
God, no.
no, no, no, no!
this isn't happening.
how much longer before she's up and running?
she's not a machine.
I just gave her the transfusion.
it'll take some time.
well, take too much time, and the city will pay for it.
Sylar's out there.
you mean the boogeyman?
don't try to get up.
I can do it.
I can tell you where he is.
okay. So...how do we do this?
I just...
I think about him in my mind, then I point to him on the map there.
I need a push pin.
so you can find anyone in the world?
you just need to think about them?
almost anyone.
almost?
there's only one that I can't.
who's that?
is it someone bad, Molly, like the boogeyman?
no.
he's a lot worse.
and why don't you want to find him?
cause when I think about him... he can see me.
Molly...can you think about Sylar now?
he's there.
that's the Lower East Side.
somewhere around Reed Street.
Isaac's loft.
the painter?
who?
I've gotta call Peter.
why don't you let me answer that for you.
hello.
where is she?
where she belongs, with her family.
dad!
I'm her family.
no, you're the man we gave her to to look after, to keep safe.
a job you haven't done particularly well.
what are you gonna do with her?
take her someplace far enough to keep her out of harm's way.
I suggest you do the same.
there isn't much time.
let me say goodbye to her.
dad.
are you okay? - Yeah.
I'm just trying to get away from these people.
no, no.
you're better off going with them.
What?!
she's right.
you shouldn't be here.
but as soon as you're safe out of the city, you try and get away.
do you understand?
Yeah.
I need to find Peter.
where is he?
I don't know. They won't tell me.
that's long enough, dear.
tell me you have a plan, Dad.
I have a plan.
I love you, Claire.
I love you too.
we have a new priority. Peter Petrelli. We have to find him.
what for?
we know where Sylar is. We can go after him.
no, not without Petrelli.
he's the only one who can stop him.
I've come 3, 000 miles.
I left my pregnant wife at home.
he's a bad guy. I'm a cop. I'm going after him.
then he will kill you.
Yeah, we'll see.
there you are, sir.
thank you.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm Peter. I'm your father's new nurse.
Yes, I've heard.
I'm Simone Deveaux.
nice to meet you.
your mother seems to know my father somehow.
Yeah, she's, uh... yeah, she's, uh-- sorry.
Yeah, my mother, she's-- she's full of surprises.
I want to thank you for this.
I know it's a real hard job.
dying is hard.
what I do, it's just... I'm here to help.
no, you're a real hero to care for a perfect stranger like this.
this may sound strange, but...
your father's last few weeks, his death...
it could be beautiful if you let it be.
sure, a piece of cake.
I'm not saying it's not tragic for you.
I'm just saying...
you know, death is the one thing that connects us all.
reminds us that's what really important is who we've touched, and...
you know, how much we've given.
makes us realize that... we have to be good to one another.
see, your father... he's the real hero.
not me.
come on, I'll show you the apartment.
get you settled in.
believe me, if he knew, you'd know,
there's a look you just can't hide when it first shows.
what about Nathan?
Linderman tells me Nathan will be ready to play his part.
well, he's been wrong before.
meaning what exactly?
I think that Linderman is betting on the wrong brother.
we talking about the same Peter here?
I look in Peter's eyes, I see compassion, empathy.
but most of all, I see hope.
this world won't be saved on strength.
what it really needs is heart, and that's Peter.
Charles, don't get me wrong.
I love Peter, but that poor kid can barely get out of his own way.
he's ruled by insecurities.
he's weak.
no, trust me.
this bomb is going to go off.
and Nathan is going to be the one the world turns to.
I don't believe this tragedy's inevitable.
well, then...one of us is going to be right.
and one of us won't.
well, I'm glad I won't be alive to see which one that is.
you are in my prayers, Charles.
I could use them.
good-bye, my dear, dear friend.
I know you're there, Peter.
hmm, looks like you dropped something.
a comic book that predicts the future.
what will they think of next?
you're kidding.
this is how Isaac thought I'd die? Stabbed by a silly little man!
Hiro is not silly.
you should've seen the look on his face when he tried to kill me.
you cannot take my brain. - Please.
what would I want with your brain?
where is Peter Petrelli? - I don't know.
where is he
let him go.
I don't think I'm going to.
I'm okey.
I'm here to save you,
all you have to do is stop time before I cut off his head.
do you think you can do your little trick before I can do mine?
don't worry about me!
just stab him!
you can't be here. - Look what you did.
Oh, my God! Micah.
it's all your fault, Niki.
D. L.now Micah.
they're both gone... because you were weak.
Micah, please.
the wrong sister died. It should've been you.
face it, Niki. You're nothing.
I'm the one they needed.
Molly, we need to go now.
where are we going?
officer Parkman called.
he believes that Sylar-- he believe the boogeyman is on his way.
no. He's not on his way.
he's already here.
I have to get some paperwork.
I'm not gonna be coming back to my office.
helicopter's picking us up from the roof in ten minutes.
when the jet lands tomorrow morning, you'll be safe.
but everyone else will be dead.
how can you do nothing to stop this?
it's inevitable, dear. There's nothing anyone can do about it.
that's insane!
nothing is inevitable. The future is not written in stone.
I'm afraid this one is.
if everything is so inevitable, then why has she been trying to keep us apart all these years?
there are things you simply aren't mature enough to understand yet.
Yeah, like how you can let your own son die like this.
your own brother.
he's not gonna die.
thanks to you, Peter has the ability to survive.
so he lives... and kills millions of people.
how can you let him be responsible for something like that?
and how can you live with yourself if he is?
Claire, I know that it's hard for you to trust me right now.
but this is all gonna make sense very soon.
I promise.
we're offering you everything you've ever wanted, Claire.
a place to belong. A family.
I already have a family.
No!
I know what you're thinking, Nathan.
let her go. You understand.
how many times have I saved your ass?
I'm the only reason that you're still alive.
that's not me. Stop her.
find Micah. - What?
I said stop her. That's not me.
I'm not strong enough.
who the hell are you talking to?
mom? - Micah?
mom, I'm in here! It's locked!
mom.
is it really you?
it's me, baby.
it's just me.
he could be a bad guy.
he needs my help.
okay, we need to get him out of here.
it's not working.
they've must have shut it down.
okay, I need a lookout. Can you do that?
stand over here and keep an eye out.
if anyone comes, tell me straight away.
Hiro, You did it!
you were faster than sylar.
now I'll go back.
we can go back together, surprise him!
no, ando!
this part of my journey...
I must finish alone.
but...I am not afraid.
I know.
you have shown me what bravery is.
your whole life you talked about your favorite stories...
star wars, star trek, superman, Kensei...
all the heroes you wanted to be.
ond day, people will tell the story of...
Hiro Nakamura.
so you'll know i'll be back.
But...your sword?
it is not the sword. it is the man.
the man is ready.
you look bad ass.
Really?
invisibility.
always thought that that would be a good one to have.
I don't understand. How is this happening?
you're alive.
is this a dream?
am I time traveling?
are you doing this?
doesn't really matter what it is, does it?
only that you're here now.
Yeah, but I saw you speaking to my mother. You know about the bomb.
you know about everything.
you came here because you needed to.
you needed to hear the truth before you could save the world.
I save the world?
you've had the power all along, Peter.
you just needed to learn how to use it.

because there has to be one that's good.
there always has.
and your heart has the ability to love unconditionally.
like I told you.
in the end, all that really matters...is love.
I'm tired now.

I must've blacked out.
how did you find me?
I told you. We have a tracking system.

she's safe. She's with your mother.
my mother? - Yeah.
they're on their way out of the city right now.
okay, you need to leave too.
I don't think I can control this. - No, I'm staying with you.
you saved my daughter's life.
I told you I owed you for that.
consider this payback.
Yeah, but if I can't stop Sylar, if I lose it, I could
I'll put you down myself.
don't worry. I'm a pretty good shot.
thank you, Mr. Bennet.
call me Noah.
come on.
the guards are coming.
dad!
Micah? We have to go.
it won't work. - Yes, it will.
come on! DL
come on, dad!
you know, it doesn't look like there's many places to hide.
you sure about this tracking system?
he's here. Don't worry.
look, all right, then that means he's hiding in plain sight.
what took you so long?
#Haven't I killed you before?
didn't take.
you think I'm gonna let you ruin it all?
take all the glory?
Let;s go!
did you really think you could stop me?
mom, Dad needs your help!
go back to your family. I've got this.
wait, no!
turns out you're the villain, Peter.
I'm the hero.
you.
Ya-ta.
you can stop this.
how?
I need you to kill me.
do it.
do it, claire, you are the only one.
tell me there's another way, please.
shoot me.
there is no other way.
Yes, there is, Claire.
the future isn't written in stone.
I took his power, Nathan.
I can't control it.
I can't do anything.
I'm not leaving you, Peter.
there's another way to end this, and you know it.
I can't let you die.
and I can't let everyone else.

of fire, of love, of death.
and then it happens.
the dream becomes real.
and the answer to this quest, this need to solve life's mysteries finally shows itself.
like the glowing light of a new dawn.
let's go home.
Hmph. Home where? Our house burned down.
home is anywhere our family is together.
you've got a plan, right?
so much struggle for meaning, for purpose.
and in the end, we find it only in each other.
our shared experience of the fantastic.
and the mundane.
the simple human need to find a kindred. To connect.
and to know in our hearts...
that we are not alone.
outside kyoto, japan, 1671
the sun rises on a new dawn.
yet few of us realize the debt we owe to those responsible for this.
to those who dwell among us, anonymous, seemingly ordinary, whom destiny brought together to repair, to heal, to save us from ourselves.
if evolution can do this for even the smallest of creatures, then why not these human beings?
if someone here...
found out about me, what would happen?
when will they stop?
I don't know.
she's a shiny new toy, and she's all mine.
and they're still out there, among us, in the shadows, in the light.
we pass them on the street without a glance, never suspecting, never knowing.
do they even know yet?
that they are bound together by a common purpose, a glaring reality, to be extraordinary?
teleportation, tissue generation; these are no longer simply theories.
I have seen them with my own eyes.
and when destiny does anoint them...
my name is hiro nakamura.
I'm from the future.
how do they hide from it?
you may feel confined here, but this is far freer a cage than the one they'd put you in.
how long can they dwell in the shadows before either fate or their own flawed humanity draws them out into the light again?
and how will they know what awaits them when it finally does?
chapter one " four months later...
and not only are these special individuals among us, they bear a curse.
in the last few months, I have discovered what I believe to be a plague.
a plague which targets only these unique individuals.
it's a disease which threatens to eradicate them all.
and in doing so, deprives our species of its evolutionary advancement.
without this advancement, the challenges of the modern world:
global warming, terrorism, diminishing resources, seem almost insurmountable on our thin shoulders.
the fate of humanity itself hangs in the balance.
but with proper funding and research, we can stop the advancement of this disease.
I urge each and every one of you to take up this cause, spread the word, and fight those who would keep the world from the truth.
thank you all for coming.
inspirational lecture, dr. Suresh.
I was wondering if I could trouble you for an autograph.
your father would've been so proud.
so would your sister.
who the hell are you and why are you following me?
this isn't necessary.
I'm nobody.
what, you think I didn't recognize you?
you've been at three of my lectures. - Yeah.
the company sent you to bag and tags me?
is that it?
a year ago, I would've run, but not anymore!
well, that's good, because if you had, I wouldn't be able to offer you a job.
I've been down that road before.
it doesn't end well.
where will you go, dr. Suresh?
no one even believes they exist.
I found your father's book in the parapsychology section in-between hypnosis and alien abductions.
they don't take you seriously.
they all think you're nuts.
but not me.
so if you're really interested in saving the world, the least you can do is let me buy you a drink.

Claire, NOAH, BENNET, COSTA VERDE, CALIFORNIA
all the electives I wanted filled up last semester.
come on. It's your first day.
you should be excited.
I am.
well, it's easy for you to say.
you're not wading into the shark-infested waters of 11th grade.
I don't have one friend.
I am shark bait.
Oh, you're gonna do fine.
they don't look any different from the kids in Texas.
okay, except for her.
so maybe they're a little bit more...
sophisticated here, but you're gonna fit right in.
if you say so.
just remember what we talked about.
I know.
I'm claire butler.
I won't slip up.
it's not just the name.
it's everything.
trust me.
the company is still out there.
and they will find us unless we're flawless with our plan.
from now on...
you have to be entirely un-extraordinary.
right.
don't stand out in any way.
exactly.
don't raise your hand in class.
and don't even think about trying out for cheerleading.
Oh, come on, dad.
that's all behind me.
just blend in.
be ordinary, right?
you got it.
you know, we might want to start by you not driving me to school.
it kind of draws attention to me.
and, you know...
don't you think it might be easier on all of us if...
I had my own car?
your mother and i were going to surprise you on your birthday next month.
but...
Oh, my gosh. The rogue?
thank you, daddy!
it's yours.
you're the best dad in the world.
I know.
I know.
it's just...
I just can't help thinking about how many times I've said good-bye to you on the first day of school.
I'm so sorry for everything I've put you through.
hope you know how much I love you.
sorry.

my HERO
I MUST SAVE YOU
I'm asking one more time.

look, I know this sucks, nypd showing up at your door like this.
I get it.
but this is what happens when you take somebody hostage.
I just need to make sure everybody gets out of there safely, okay?

dude, it's her.
shoot her. Shoot her.
how did you know?
okay, guys. Good job.
let's clean this place up.
all guns to the armory.
how did you know which one to shoot?
I don't know.
tone of voice. Eye contact.
the hostage looked me in the eye.
the other was looking for an exit.
well, most people notice a gun under the bad guy's shirt.
right.
Yeah, that too. Of course.
you know, guys who get shot like you did, they just take that worker's comp and call it a day.
I've been, uh, I've wanted to be a cop my whole life.
four bullets to the chest aren't gonna change that.
well, we were gonna drag this out, make you sweat.
but I figured, what's the point?
take that off.
I figured that, uh, you'd rather have a real one.
well, you gonna take it? - Yeah. Yeah.
thank you.
wow, thank you so much.
turn on your bunsen burners, people, and be careful.
you got a death wish?
uh, you talking about that?
I was just seeing how hot it was.
pretty sure it's hot.
it's called a "flame." - Yeah.
I was just kidding around.
like you were this morning when you stepped in front of my car?
that's okay.
made my morning interesting.
I'm west.
you're new, right?
Yeah.
so what are you?
meaning what, exactly?
meaning are you one of them...
or one of the others?
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
well, let me break it down for you.
are you a robot or an alien?
cause everyone in the world is one or the other.
robots do what they're told.
stick with the herd.
aliens, on the other hand, do their own thing.
well, uh, I don't know.
do I have to choose?
most people do.
so what are you?
okay, everyone.
in the struggle for survival, it is the fittest who win out at the expense of their rivals.
now who said this?
come on, people.
journey of the beagle.
evolution.
anyone?
Charles darwin.
it's charles darwin.
easy one.
looks like my lucky day
how much?
ten thousand Lempiras...
I'll take you as far as Sonora.
that's six hundred miles from the American border.
okay.
you two married?
she's my sister
even better
you can ride with me up front
in your dreams
ride with me or you don't ride at all
she stays with me
we'll ride in back
you are late.
no, I believe I'm right on-time.
I believe that your watch is slow.
guess what? - What?
Max grossman tried to kiss me today.
what? - Mr. Parkman?
Yeah.
can I speak to you for a minute?
uh, sure. Can you give us a second?
sure.
is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just a little concerned, that's all.
Molly's been falling asleep in class the last week or so.
and when I asked her about it, she said she's been having some nightmares.
um, she's got kind of a big imagination.
and I realize that there's really nothing I can do about them, so I'm just trying to make her feel as safe as possible.
about that, I know it's not exactly my place, but your situation isn't the most stable.
my situation?
your injuries. Your divorce.
look, uh, my divorce is my business.
and all you really need to know is that molly is loved and well-cared for and she's doing great.
she's struggling, Mr. Parkman.
Why? Because she's having a few nightmares?
because of these.
she started drawing them a week or so ago.
every day, they get a little worse.
Oh, my god.
and I have to ask you, what is this?
it's in every single picture.
Kaito NAKAMURA ANDO MANHATTAN
excuse me.
sir, with no disrespect to you or Hiro...
it's been almost four months...
and there's been no sign of him
maybe he's not coming back
for close to thirty years...
I have seen my son as a disappointment
a dreamer who excelled at nothing
it was not until Hiro began this quest...
that i saw his strength. courage and wisdom
there is legacy...
that i am meant to hand down to him
No...i will wait for Hiro to return
I am a man of patience
this can't be
where did you get this newspaper?
from your office
sir what is it?
what does it mean?
in twenty-four hours...
I'll be dead
Nathan ANGEKA PETRELLI PETERS APT. NEW YORK
what are you doing here, ma?
it's time to move on, nathan, he's dead.
you don't know that.
leave his stuff alone.
he's gonna want it when he gets back.
you're drunk.
thank god your father isn't here to see you.
or you, for that matter.
you killed your brother. Drove heidi away. Drove your kids away.
if you'd followed our plan
if you'd done what you were supposed to do, he would be alive now.
to think I almost listened to you.
you're evil, ma.
get out.
I did it
what happened?
how did we get here?
I brought you here
they were about to put holes in you
fifty ryo is not worth dying for
you can tell Takezo Kensei...
he can keep his damn money
but if you're not Takezo Kensei...
then who is...
what did you do?
you made him run away!
what did you do?
what did you make them scatter?
if I put an arrow through that leader's heart
I would've been a very rich man
Takezo Kensei?
what are you?
some sort of monk?
you dress so strangely for a monk
and you wear glasses like a doctor
I'm not a monk
I'm your biggest fan
I know all about you. Takezo Kensei
I know all stories about you
I stole your sword
you are the hero Kensei?
my name here is Kensei
but no one's ever called me a hero before can you excuse me?
you were late.
it's my daughter's first day of high school.
had to make sure she was okay.
copy KINGDOM COSTA VERDE, CALIFORNIA And that's, uh, somehow my problem?
that shipment of toner cartridges came in last night.
I know. I was here.
and when exactly are they going to get installed?
cause I don't see anybody else here doing it.
I'm gonna do it this morning.
and if I wasn't here watching your every move?
you know, you've been here for a few months, butler.
I think it's time I saw some commitment to excellence from you.
when I was assistant manager, we were fully set before the first customer walked through that door.
that is how I got this.
paper business is dog eat dog.
you gotta live it and breathe it. You gotta want it.
do you want it, butler?
do you?
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
well, we'll see.
the company was formed 30 years ago with a group of like-minded individuals, ordinary men and women who were gifted with extraordinary powers.
they wanted to help their own.
to find them and to protect them.
we find people, and we make sure they don't become dangerous.
now sometimes that can mean making sure they understand entirely what they're capable of.
and teaching them to use their abilities for the good of mankind.
and sometimes it can mean eliminating them.
who the hell are you to judge who lives and who dies?
if I'm not mistaken, you yourself tried to put a bullet in the brain of a man named sylar.
he was a monster.
Yes.
and you were willing to kill him for the greater good.
you acted on a moral imperative to protect your species.
it doesn't matter one way or the other about sylar.
he's no longer a threat. He's dead.
and now you have molly.
you and matt parkman are protecting her.
now we're not interfering with that arrangement. Far from it.
we're offering to help you.
we have resources to offer you, dr. Suresh.
the plague.
you talked about the disease which killed your sister, shanti.
the virus. - Yes.
we have the funds you need for your research.
now, can you imagine what would happen if that virus mutated and crossed over into the general population?
look, the type of research you're talking about is extremely expensive.
trust me.
that won't be a problem.
let's just say we have our own private fort knox.
so can we count you in?
thank you. - You're welcome.
SURESH'S APARTMENT BROOKLYM Dinner!
uh, shouldn't I be eating some vegetables every once in a while?
well, that is why I got you a vegetable pizza, smarty-pants.
plus I got your favorite rocky road for desert.
you're just trying to bribe me 'cause you never cook.
I miss mohinder.
he cooks.
Hey, I can cook.
I just thought why not order pizza? Give us time to talk.
talk about what? This?
does that mean you passed your detective's exam?
with flying colors. Why? You proud of me?
mm, depends. Did you cheat?
why would you ask me that?
reading the answers out of people's minds, it's unfair.
no, it is my natural talent.
you wouldn't think a baseball player's cheating 'cause he's athletic, would you?
it's not the same and you know it. - No.
you know what; I want to talk to you about these drawings that you made at school.
you're changing the subject.
ms. Gerber's concerned and so am I.
you don't want to talk about your exams; I don't want to talk about my dreams.
Molly. I want to help you.
I don't want you to be
I said I didn't want to talk about it!
can I finish my dinner in my room?
sure. Go ahead.
this book is incredible, Alejandro
this man has figured it all out
yes...
if he knows the cause. there has to be a cure
Yes, it's just that, God would not have done this to me without a chance for salvation
Maya. it's not your fault
you have to believe that
you keep saying that...
but your words don't make it any easier, Alejandro
especially when i know what can happen
noting will happen
not when i'm with you. I won't let it happen
why did we stop?
you guys
come with me
just stay here
what's the problem?
our financial arrangement...
did i say ten thousand Lempiras?
what i meant to say was...
ten thousand for each of you...
no...
I remember it was for both of us
pardon me
I made a mistake
what i meant was...
that you ride in the back...
and your sister rides up front with me
I told you she stays with me
that's it...
the deal, take it or leave it
you son of bitch
No! You don't understand...
for God's sake!
you're making a mistake
nice move, ballerina.
how's that floor taste?
are you okay?
don't listen to them. I'm going to go find the band-aid thing.
thank you.
no problem.
robot.
so I'm a robot now, huh?
far as I can tell.
okay.
birdie, please.
you don't even know me.
you had the answer today in class, but you didn't say it.
you don't want people to know that you are smart.
you just have me all figured out, huh?
know a robot when I see one.
come on, martha.
it's just a back flip off the tower.
and you know the girls will catch you.
just leave her alone, okay?
okay, one
don't know you.
and two--as captain of the cheerleading squad, it's totally within my rights to recruit talent where I see it.
I think martha here has what it takes to be a cheerleader.
so you can do a back tuck off the tower?
what's the big deal?
if it's so easy, why don't you try it?
in fact, if you can do a back tuck off the tower, martha here is off the hook.
all right.
I'll do it.
this should be good.
we're waiting.
you're right.
can't do it.
there's a shocker.
help!
help me!
don't hurt me.
No!
Noooo!
I can see you.
it's okay.
it's all right. It was just a dream.
it was just a dream.
Oh, my gosh, he can see me.
did you see him?
see what he look like?
okay, you tell me where he is and I will take care of him.
no.
he's too dangerous.
if I tell you where he is, he'll kill you too.
no. No, no, no.
nobody's going to kill anyone.
I promise.
I promise. I'm right here.
don't go, please.
why are you still here?
U're still on your break.
Yes, I am.
you were supposed to be back on the floor five minutes ago.
there's a line of customers out there.
just finishing my coffee.
uh, no, you're finished.
get out there.
just a few more sips, that's all.
you look at me when I talk to you.
do you hear me?
I hear you all right.
now you hear me.
I am done eating your crap.
from now on, I will work how and when I feel like it.
I will take breaks when I want to.
and you will not say a damn word to me ever again.
do you understand?
square on that?
Yeah.
I don't understand
Takezo kensei the legendary samurai master...
my father read me tales of.
I have to pee are you sure u'r takezo kensei?
you are english?
Oh, and there's a surprise.
you know, there are very few locals here with whom I can speak plain.
thank god for you, young man.
eh, sorry. - Yuck!
so I came over on one of the few trade vessels your emperor let pass.
the boat left full of tea, I kept on to find my fortune.
you should see what I got paid to fend off those bandits.
Takezo kensei does not fight for money.
he fights for honor.
Really?
well, as long as it's honor I can spend.
it's not bad a lot.
I mean, I find a stout brute, put him on a horse, put him in a field, and tell him to shout on about how he's fearsome old kensei.
then I repair to the branch of a tree and start to pick off the black guards one by one.
that's fighting dirty!
that's fighting smart, sir.
what? I give him a fair wage.
if he lives.
no.
this can't be.
no. I come from the future.
many years from now.
your noble deeds become part of our history.
the future? - Yes.
that's a good one.
no, it is true.
I know what happens to you.
as a boy I read the book the trials of takezo kensei.
how you killed the black bear of sakashita, your love of the swordsmith's daughter, and you defeat the terrible white bearded warlord and save the village of Otsu.
Otsu? - You smell smoke?
what village is that?
that would be Otsu sir...
let me see it.
I do not take death threats idly.
someone's playing a trick.
are they?
your husband.
all of them.
dead.
now there are nine.
so you think one of us sent these?
Yes.
for the pain we cause.
the people we have killed.
there is no end to our suffering.
I sought redemption by helping hiro fulfill his destiny to save the world.
how did you help your son?
I am leaving for Japan tonight.
I suggest you disappear as well.
what happened here?
bandits. They took everything.
is there no God to protect us?
Oh, no. I broke history.
village's burn.
those things happen.
but not like this!
the future may not exist as I know it.
no future. No cars. No ando. No me.
great scott.
you mustn't fret everything, my very strange little friend.
here, have some sake. It'll brighten your day.
no, forget sake!
you're supposed to be a hero.
being a hero never filled anyone's sack with salt and saffron.
it's a waste of time, huh?
in the stories, you are rewarded with more gold than the emperor.
and you took the swordsmith's daughter, the most beautiful woman in all Japan for your princess.
we gave you everything we had to defend us.
now our homes are burned.
those bandits took my father hostage.
and you sit here drinking?
no need for everyone's day to be ruined.
you swore to challenge them in battle.
I did, Yaeko.
but this man got in the way.
my sword! - My sword!
it's my father's sword.
he forged it.
he gave it to you as payment for your protection.
she's the swordsmith's daughter?
and I don't think she wants to be my princess.
wait!
swordsmith's daughter!
where are you going?
someone must rescue my father.
if Kensei will not...
I will!
wait! Don't leave!
no? - No.
you have to rescue the swordsmith and make the daughter fall in love with you.
you have to become the legendary japanese hero that you are destined to be.
you have to fight black bear. You have to fight the 11
the only thing I have to do is find me a drink.
come on.
this is going to be tough.
86 straight days of sunshine. You just can't beat that.
right, lyle?
I don't know. I guess.
so, claire, lyle was saying that his first day of school was uneventful.
how about you? Anything special happen?
no.
no, nothing. I, uh, skated by unnoticed.
it was like I wasn't even there.
that's good, honey.
and how about you, sweetheart?
me?
anything interesting happen today at copy kingdom?
I, uh, I made a calendar for some grandparents.
and a coworker brought in donuts.
that's great.
I just think it's amazing how well we have all adjusted to our new lives. Her, it's inspirational, really.
the bennets were given lemons and what did we make?
uh, lemonade? - Exactly.
I'll second that.
we're all flourishing really, all except Mr. Muggles.
no one has any idea you won two regional championships, five all-breed rallies.
poor little guy.
I mean, how do you go back to the farm after you have seen gay paris?
thank you.
must be work.
excuse me.
excuse me.
well?
they finally took the bait.
they caught up with me in Cairo.
I'm in. - Good.
it's all falling into place. Just...
just stay careful. Watch your back.
and you and I will bring this whole company down.
no.
what did i do... what did I do?
I didn't want to do it.
I know you didn't.
don't worry.
my God...
my God, what have I done?
we have to go.
we have to get to the United States...
to New York.
that doctor is the only one that can help you.
come...
Maya, listen to me.
give me your hand, let's go.
and the others?
we'll go to where it's safe...
and that's where we'll bury them. Let's go, let's go.
why are you calling me?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
well, don't do it again.
I gotta go. - No, wait.
listen, I know why you're doing this.
I get it. I miss him too.
I just...
I need someone to talk to.
I don't know if I can do this anymore.
do what?
not be who I really am.
and I know that I can't be who they want me to be.
and I just feel like I'm gonna burst.
look, I know you're looking for answers. We all are.
but trust me, I am not the guy... to give 'em to you.
I'm sorry.
Ando.
all of them, I never expected it would be you.
sir... I have it.
Hey!
sir!
sir!
cork, IRELAND
what are you trying to do? Kill the poor bastard?
sorry.
drag him someplace where he'll stay dry. And make sure he's breathing, for the love of pete.
right you are, boss.
we're looking for 9-1-0-9.
the numbers are on the side here.
supposed to be the third row back.
Hey, boss! Over there!
Hey, I figured I'd keep a case for me self.
what are you gonna do with a dozen ipods? You can barely use a computer.
Ah, what do you know?
what the hell?
maybe we got the wrong number.
no, the number's right. Something else is wrong.
what's that?
what the hell are you doing here?
where are the ipods?
you heard the man. How'd you get in here?
maybe this will jog your memory.
what the hell was that?
who the hell are you?
I said, " who are you? "
what's your name?
I don't know.
I don't know.
we find people and we make sure they don't become dangerous.
and you yourself wanted to put a bullet in the brain of a man named Sylar.
he's no longer a threat. He's dead.
they finally took the bait.
they caught up with me in Cairo.
I'm in.
find out what you can.
I'll find the other paintings myself.
I was only given the first.
there's seven more.
what's in the other paintings?
I don't know.
my God...
my God, what have I done?
we have to get to the United States...
to New York.
the doctor is the only one that can help you.
no way.
you might want this, Peter.
this here is everything you had on you when we found you.
it's all yours.
you just have to help us with one little job.
just tell me what I need to do to get my life back.
you mean this?
the box with your identity in it?
Peter Petrelli Cork, Ireland Sure. It's all yours.
as long as you do us one favor, yeah?
see, Celtic is taking on AC Milan.
we're talkin' football, yeah?
soccer.
I lost my memory. I'm not an idiot.
the local sports book will be full of cash.
after the match, all that money gets put in a lockbox and taken to an armored car.
so you're gonna rob an armored car.
all we're askin' is that you get rid of the guards before they call for help.
simple, really.
so if I get you your box, you'll give me mine.
everyone wins.
not everybody, sideshow.
that cash is mine. Even if I have to kill you for it.
what did you say?
I - I didn't say a word.
you said you were gonna take the cash.
are you accusing me of something?
I heard what you said. He said it.
you see that?
that's the family crest.
these lads are me brothers.
and I trust 'em a hell of a lot more than I trust you.
why would I lie?
I know Will.
I don't know you.
you don't even know yourself.
Maya Alejandro somewhere in Mexico.
Maya, you need to rest
you're dehydrated, you haven't eaten...
there's blisters all over your feet...
we can't stop now. In a few days we'll be at the border.
I don't know if you're going to last a few days.
how about that Cadillac?
since when are you a car thief?
since I vowed to get my sister to America, no matter what it took.
now stand back.
Alejandro, police!
run, Maya!
Niki Micah Sanders Las Vegas I know. I'm sorry.
I don't want to leave Las Vegas.
if there was any other way, Micah...
we're a family.
we're supposed to stay together.
this is our chance at a fresh start.
without dad?
Hey.
I promise you, whenever you want to see your father, I will make sure that happens.
it's time for us to say good-bye.
Hey.
no, he's still sleeping.
what can I say? The guy's tired.
you--he's waking up.
I'll have to call you later. Yeah.
good morning, sleepyhead.
you wanna go for a dip?
where am I?
we're in Maui.
nice, huh?
feel those trade winds.
who are you?
I'm Michelle.
I used to go by Candice, but ever since I pulled you off of Kirby Plaza the police have kind of been looking for my old self.
I'm going for a new look.
what do you think?
you dragged me off Kirby Plaza?
after you got stabbed through the chest with a samurai sword.
eight surgeries later and here we are.
which reminds me, don't try to move or you'll rip your stitches.
daiquiri?
stitches?
there's nothing there.
I covered 'em up.
I make illusions.
it's kinda my thing.
so none of this is real?
show me what's really going on here.
honey, you really don't want to know.
show me.
chapter THREE KINDRED
Claire Bennet Costa Verde, California
Hey.
your mom made waffles.
uh, okay.
I'll be down in a minute.
you were right to be angry.
you tried to talk to me, and I lost my temper.
I'm sorry.
no, it's fine.
I shouldn't have ambushed you with all those questions.
of course you should, Claire.
I've asked you to carry around a heck of a secret.
and I think sometimes I don't appreciate how difficult that must be.
so if you have anything you want to ask me, as long as we're in the privacy of our own home, please, ask away.
if someone here found out about me, what would happen?
we'd have to leave California immediately.
go deeper into hiding.
maybe forgo schools and jobs altogether.
that's worst case scenario.
it was a pedicure.
I'm sorry.
the other night.
that's what I was doing.
I was giving myself a pedicure.
you're not very good at it.
what is it with you creeping around my house at night anyway?
just tryin' to lend you a book.
okay, you know what, if I want to start a book club with you, I'll let you know.
until then, just stay away from me.
will do.
just walk me through this one last time.
I didn't see you cut off your toe, is that right?
the bottle of nail polish fell over and it just looked like it was bleeding.
improvising is really not your forte.
why are you such a smart-ass?
why are you so bad at lying?
I'm not lying.
fine then. You gave yourself a pedicure.
and your toe came off and then came back on.
works for me.
I'm going to class.
don't do your nails on the way.
Matt Parkman Brooklyn
Freeze!
Oh, for god's sake.
quiet down.
you'll wake Molly.
what are you doing home? I thought you were in Cairo.
haiti, actually.
my plane got in a couple of hours ago.
I'll be working here in the city from now on.
I thought you were in the field.
they're setting me up in a place downtown.
which means I'll be around to help with Molly.
which means you're going to be doing your spy work in our own back yard -- great.
someone's grouchy when they don't get their sleep.
Molly's struggling.
nightmares, problems at school.
I can't babysit her and you at the same time.
and why would I need babysitting?
you're in over your head.
thank you, but- - they abducted me.
kept me prisoner.
I know you think you can beat them at their own game, but, Mohinder, no offense, you're a professor.
you're not 007.
I told myself I would do whatever it took to take down the company.
that's how I can help Molly.
you want to help Molly?
don't die on her.
Mohinder, you're home!
that's right.
and I'm never leaving again.
andd YAMAGATD INDUSTRIES TOKYO
this is what I pay you for?
sorry sir. I was just taking a break.
you think spending a few months with the CEO means you don't have to work?
now get to it!
sorry.
Oh Hiro, I hope wherever you are you're doing better than me.
ando, open.
ando, I write to you from the greatest adventure of my life.
I know I might disrupt the space/time continuum, but I've teleported back to the year 1671...
where I've befriended my childhood hero, the great Takezo Kensei!
it turns out, he's not exactly how we imagined...
and that's why I've decided to stay.
to turn him into the man that history needs him to be.
fortunately I've made a miraculous discovery.
the great Takezo Kensei has powers too!
godsend!
what in heaven?
all this blood and no wound.
you have a power!
an amazing power!
what have you done to me?
this is how you become a hero!
I will fix history after all!
this is impossible.
this must be some sort of trick.
no. Look.
Lazarus risen.
you've cursed me.
no. This is not a curse.
it's a gift.
this gift will help you through the trials.
to help find the fire scroll, uh, the 90 hungry ronins, help rescue yaeko's father.
get away from me!
you're a devil.
no, no. I'm here to help you.
Kensei, wait!
we have to write history!
lightning.
lightning!
sparks!
lightning!
so you just yell it out.
well, I'm just trying to understand how it works.
that makes two of us.
so far, I got nothin'.
well, it's a shame you can't order lightning up like a plate of chips.
sure would come in handy tonight.
God, you know, I can do all these things.
it's just--I feel powerless.
it's tough not knowing who you are.
Yeah, looks like I might just die before I ever figure it out.
maybe you're an extraterrestrial, escaped from a government facility.
I have to admit, I'm pretty excited to see you open that box.
and don't worry about tonight.
I'll be there to watch your back.
how do I know I can trust you?
I haven't told anyone about what you can do, now have I?
why is that?
girl's gotta have her secrets.
please, it was a mistake.
you're back. Busy morning?
had to chase this kid across town.
what did he do?
SOLICITADOS POR LA JUSTICIA POR HOMICIDIO
tried to steal a car. Nothing interesting.
dude, you look like ass.
no English.
all right.
today, we are talking about mitosis.
Yes, West.
I have a question about yesterday's topic.
regeneration in lizards.
now, I know you said humans couldn't regenerate.
but what if a lizard were to mate with a human?
could their offspring do it?
because I think I met a lizard girl.
this doesn't strike me as a productive conversation, West.
but seriously.
what if that lizard girl were to accidentally cut off her arm, or a leg, or you name the appendage, in some kind of horrifying spa debacle?
where exactly are you going with this?
would said appendage reattach itself back onto her lizard body?
righting history and turning Takezo Kensei into a hero will not be easy.
but at least I'm not alone.
ando, I've met the most beautiful woman Japan has ever seen.
and I think I've fallen in love with her.
the only problem?
history has already written that story.
and she is destined to be the greatest love of Takezo Kensei.
are you sure he did not run away?
Kensei? He does not run away from danger, he runs towards it.
and punches its face!
these he is. I will bring him.
and everything will be better.
I cut myself and the wound heals over and over again.
you are a hero, like me.
I have powers too.
you?
Really? - Yes.
I can stop time and move through space.
hello.
how are such things possible?
some say it's a gift from god.
some people think it's evolution.
what is that? Evolution?
it means you can heal from any wound.
Really?
any wound?
sword?
serpent?
fire?
this'll make me richer than the pope.
rich? - Yes!
swordsman are obsessed with duels in this country.
I'll clean up in wages.
you have to defeat white beard and fight the 90 hungry ronin.
if you're obsessed with my stories so much, how about you handle them?
Kensei, you have to stop walking away from your destiny!
who's going to stop me?
who?
no one is going to stop me because no one can stop me.
God. This is extraordinary!
it was clear Kensei wouldn't become a hero unless I forced him to learn the hard way.
if he could defeat the 90 Angry Ronin...
he'd have a chance at becoming a hero.
where have you taken me?
to get the fire scroll.
it's on top of those steps.
who are they?
those are the 90 angry ronin, sworn to protect it.
how angry are they?
good luck, Kensei.
you can do this.
I take it you're annoyed.
what is it, West?
what do you want from me?
I want you to admit you're different.
okay, fine.
I'm a freak. All right?
I am such a freak, in fact, that I have to tiptoe around this school pretending to be some brainless barbie doll so nobody notices how different I am.
cause if they found out, I'd be carted off to some human zoo so I could be poked and prodded at for the rest of my life.
so yeah, West, I'm different.
and you can tell the world if you want to, because I am tired of pretending to be someone I'm not.
Claire, shut up.
be careful.
you too.
Yes, who's there?
Safeline. Here for the pickup.
I want my money back.
all right, back away, friend.
I'm not your friend, okay?
just give me my $200 back.
look, Celtic was supposed to be a lock to win, okay?
just help a guy out.
that's not our problem.
actually, it is your problem.
tie him up, Tuko.
mind these two.
stay down!
that'll be that now.
there he is!
stop!
go!
isn't this Isaac Mendez's loft?
the painter.
it was.
until Sylar killed him.
he was murdered?
every space has some unhappiness in its past.
the company recently poured a lot of money into outfitting this laboratory.
everything state of the art.
well, lucky timing for me then.
Mohinder, it was built for you.
I'm sorry.
you don't realize how valued you are here at the company.
our people have been instructed to keep a close watch on you.
to anticipate your every need.
that is very generous of you.
but really, I prefer to work on my own.
supervision is in your best interest and in ours.
you're part of the family now.
you're sure Kensei is coming?
Oh, yes!
maybe he's been killed.
or kidnapped.
not Kensei. He knows you are waiting for him.
you have so much faith in him.
I want so much to trust him.
at times...
he seems as if he is two men.
one is a brute.
but the other Kensei...
he is gentle.
it sounds silly.
but there was a moment under the cherry blossoms, I felt like I was home...
Really?
I will never doubt you again.
things'll be better now.
you'll see.
but you have to remember your promise.
no more powers.
I just don't see the point of us having these abilities when we don't even use them.
the point is staying safe.
this is your chance at a normal life with normal people.
they wouldn't understand.
I just don't want you to go.
I'll only be gone for a while.
and you're gonna be staying with family.
it could be fun.
I don't even know them.
I don't know how long I'll be gone.
but I do know that when I get back, we'll be together.
I have to do this.
that's what you always say before you do something bad.
I love you.
well, welcome to New Orleans.
excuse me, I'm here to get my brother.
you arrested him today for stealing.
the fine's 2500 pesos.
I have American money.
14$
honey, this is prison, not a flea market.
but I need my brother now.
I'm sick.
we're going to America to find a doctor.
America? So you have papers to travel?
why don't you leave before I call the border police.
I wouldn't do that.
Oh yeah?
look. This is me!
this is my brother!
we're murderers.
get her! Now!
what is that?
something's not right.
Maya! Maya! Back here!
you killed them.
I couldn't leave you.
it's all right.
everything is going to be all right.
I'm here now. I'm here.
let's go.
W - wait.
take me with you.
I have a car.
Oh, jeez.
look at that.
gorgeous.
I'd say we earned these.
damn right.
Hey, drink up.
Slainte.
all right, Will the traitor.
please don't shoot.
this is no joke.
now give me that damn money or I swear I'll shoot your dead, so I will.
so I was right.
that you were.
congratulations, Peter.
hold your horses, sweetheart!
now about that money.
no way.
give me the damn money!
what the...
what the jeez
what's he doin'?
good news, Ando.
Kensai proved himself to be a hero after all.
which means soon, I'll be able to come home.
but it will not be easy to say goodbye.
I was worried you wouldn't return.
but you did.
you brought back the scroll.
now I know that you will get the rest of them up to white beard's camp.
and even yaeko loves you.
I can leave now.
wait.
wait. You're going?
Yes, I have another life to go to.
my father... Ando...
they're all waiting for me.
but what if I can't do this without you?
only you can keep me from returning to my heathen ways.
you're like a conscience.
only I take heed of you.
I almost broke history by coming back here.
if I stay, I risk making it worse.
I don't know what to say, Carp.
you've done this grubby soul a great kindness.
I thank you.
it has been my honor. - No.
no, it is I who am honored to meet the great Takezo kensei.
you are really leaving us?
you are a true and noble friend.
Bye, friend.
I'm sorry, Ando. I can't come home.
not yet.
Kensei!
Kensei!
I made you some breakfast.
I can't make it move.
that cup. I used to be able to make things move with my mind.
thanks for making breakfast, Michelle, you're a real sport.
I can't freeze anything. I can't move things. What happened to them?
uh, they must've disappeared with your injuries.
I thought you said you were taking care of me?
I'm sorry. Uh, are you breathing?
no collapsed lung? No infection from the wound?
everything that I've been working for, everything that I had, it's gone.
listen, the people I work for, they're gonna make sure you get better.
your back's already healed. It's just your chest we're worried about.
and when that heals, you'll be able to reacquire your powers.
with my help, of course.
you.
how are you gonna help?
you gonna make me some more eggs?
by making it easy.
by making it fun.
I can take you anywhere you want to go.
Paris. London.
how about Japan?
and I can be anyone you want me to be.
if your fantasy is exotic or more run-of-the-mill.
or something more familiar, if that's what you're into.
don't you see? I can help you.
we were meant to do this together.
I underestimated you.
you really are extraordinary.
just like me.
you were right.
I am gonna get my abilities back.
starting with yours.
so this is what you really look like.
so silly trying to be something that you're not.
well, Michelle or Candice or whoever you are, it wasn't all for nothing.
thanks to you...
I'll be going back to Maui now.
London.
japan.
Japan!
it's not working.
I don't have it.
your power. What's wrong with me?
Ahh!
Ah, would you quit being such a baby, pretty boy?
I may not know what you are, but I know who you are.
you're one of us.
and we have no secrets among family.
well?
well what?
this is it.
your box. Your life.
you gonna open it or what?
what if it's a life I don't want?
when I had Will against the wall,
I could've killed him.
I wanted to.
what if that's who I am?
but you didn't kill him, did you? - No, that's because of you.
it's not because of me, Peter.
you're a good soul.
I can tell.
what if I open this box and I find otherwise?
do you like the way you are right now?
do you like who you are right now?
well, then maybe for now just leave it be.
I think yours is cooler.
any time your parents get annoying, you can just open the window and take off.
are you kidding?
you're indestructible.
you can skydive without a parachute.
you could skydive without a plane.
you can eat fire just for kicks.
I feel pain.
I just get over it quickly.
so how would it feel then if I--if I do this?
it hurts!
what about this then?
what's on your neck?
a couple years ago, when we were living in St. Louis
I was riding my bike to school, and next thing I knew it was a day later and I was waking up in my bed.
last thing I remember is this man stepping out of the bushes calling my name.
what are you talking about? What man?
I don't know who he was.
but I remember the way he looked at me.
like I was an animal he wanted to trap.
I try to put him out of my head. But sometimes I can see his face.
that guy with the horn-rimmed glasses.
I have another vial.
I'll get started on it right away.
yeah?
I have to take this outside.
where are you? - I just got here.
I'm sitting in your office.
are you sure you're gonna be able to cure me?
Yes.
and like I said, in exchange, we're going to want a little something from you.
they're moving the paintings somewhere. There's only a few crates left.
this was a terrible idea. This guy's watching melike a hawk.
I can't do this. I'm in over my head.
I told you you have no reason to worry.
as long as I'm alive, you will be taken care of.
that's exactly the problem. - What are you talking about?
I'm sending you a jpeg of a painting I found.
the rest have been shipped off somewhere. It's the last in the series of 8.
we know how it begins with the death of Kaito Nakamura. But how does it end?
not well, I'm afraid.
night, Claire.
night, dad.
to be continue
I'll only be gone for a while.
this is your chance at a normal life.
welcome to New Orleans.
is that pay-per-view?
micah's some type of genius and rigged the cable.
I'll take everything you got in the register!
ando, I write to you from the greatest adventure of my life I've met the most beautiful Japanese woman,has ever seen take off...
your mask i'm sorry, ando I can't come home not yet
you don't realize how valued you are here at the company.
you're part of the family now.
I'm in over my head.
as long as I'm alive, you will be taken care of.
this here's everything you had on you when we found you.
your box or your life.
you gonna open it, or what?
Hiro nakamura, murdered.
angela petrelli, attacked.
this is my dad.
he may be the killer.
I'll find your father.
Molly, what's the apartment number?
nine. - Nine.
good girl. Get out of there right now.
he sees me. - Get out of there.
leave me alone!
Molly, please wake up.
when confronted by our worst nightmares, the choices are few: Fight or flight.
we hope to find the strength to stand against our fears.
but sometimes, despite ourselves, we run.
what if the nightmare gives chase?
Suresh, Parkman, Walker Brooklyn.
where can we hide then?
okay, when's she gonna wake up?
I don't know, she's burning up.
all right, we gotta get her to a hospital.
no hospital's equipped to deal with this.
you really think my father did this to her...in her nightmare?
she used her ability to find him for you, and slipped into this.
she was so afraid.
I never should have asked her to look for him.
no, you shouldn't have.
but now you know where he is.
I can't just leave her like this.
you have to.
if your father did something to her, you need to find out what and how to end it.
you have an address in philadelphia.
she even saw his door.
I haven't seen the man in 25 years.
Molly faced her worst nightmare for you.
do the same for her.
find him.
I'll stay here with her.
I'll do everything I can.
I don't even know what I'm dealing with.
why was he in that photo?
she knows him.
you're gonna be okay.
I promise.
I was about to lock up when this guy showed.
he pushed his way in, shoved a gun in my face.
next thing I know he's flying through that glass.
you hit an armed man?
I guess.
could've been a kick.
Monica Dawson, New Orleans.
I don't know, it all happened so fast.
is this the guy?
his name is Lonny Stills.
he's a local gangbanger.
he's already hit three other fast food joints in the area thth mon.
it fits his M. O.
like I said, it's all a blur.
look, I know you don't want to be a snitch.
it's dangerous.
but in order for me to get this guy off the street,
I need somebody to step up and I. D. Him.
be a hero.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
you know, I can't help a neighborhood that won't help itself.
you change your mind, you give me a call.
Peter Petrelli Cork, Ireland. You closing up already?
it's the middle of the afternoon.
I need a break.
I could get used to this.
right, a guy who can throw 1, 000 volts our of either hand...
settling for everyday life in a pub in cork.
I'm not sure it suits you.
why not?
Peter, just because you don't remember your past, it doesn't mean you don't have one.
aren't you curious about who you are, or where you come from?
you've seen what I can do.
there's a side of me that I can't control.
maybe it's best if I don't dig too deep.
I know the kind of man you are.
even if you don't.
there's only good in you.
and I bet whatever's in that box will tell you the same thing.
weren't you the one who didn't want me to look in that box?
I only said that because you hadn't kissed me yet.
now that you have, you done with me?
gettin' there.
after all, a pretty boy like you, there's bound to be someone looking for you.
friends.
a girlfriend.
let 'em look.
like I told you, you're not gonna find him in there.
but you're sure it was him?
Yeah.
found him cuffed inside there a few nights back.
poor sap.
didn't know how he got there.
didn't even know his own name.
do you know where he is now?
depends.
who's askin'?
just me.
I work for a company interested in keeping him out of trouble.
Peter is a... dangerous guy.
you don't have to tell me that.
he's in town.
place called wandering rocks pub.
Hey, if he's so dangerous, sweetheart, why'd they send a little girl like you in all alone?
I can take care of myself.
Petrelli Parkman, Manhattan, police station.
bring her back to holding.
what do you think you're doing interrogating my mother without me there?
relax.
she didn't give me anything.
of course she didn't give you anything.
these people protect each other.
my mother's not a killer.
I'm not gonna have her sit in jail for a crime she didn't commit.
neither am I.
that's why I'm going to Philadelphia to see my father, figure this whole thing out.
let me come with you. - No!
you're not a cop.
listen, I'm guessing this isn't official police business.
so if I'm there, it won't really make a difference.
because officially, neither are you.
you don't understand.
it's Molly.
my father did something to her.
she's in trouble.
what do you mean "did something to her"?
come here.
did what?
he got inside her head somehow.
I don't know how he did it, but I think it's all connected.
to kaito.
to your mother.
it could be dangerous.
I can take care of myself.
listen, I have to do this.
let me come with you.
fine.
we can probably get there faster.
you know, 'cause you can, uh...
I'm not a cargo jet, Parkman.
Oh, please.
I need to talk to him.
alone.
tell him what you told me.
this American girl...
she's hitting all the boys on the dock, looking for a certain shipping container.
she say what she wanted?
Yeah.
you.
don't worry.
I think I can help.
this is my problem.
not given what I just saw between you and my sister.
you care about her, don't you?
right now, she's the only thing in my life that means something.
Caitlin has a flat up the hill.
go there and stay until I call you.
I'll take care of your friend.
I could handle this myself.
I don't doubt it.
I've seen what you can do.
but I've got an investment in you now.
some little blonde's isn't going to scare me off.
now go on.
and don't be telling caitlin about any of this.
she'll only worry sick.
well?
well, what?
well, are you gonna tell me what that was all about?
uh, I just didn't want some crackhead looking for revenge.
so I said I didn't recognize him.
no, not that.
I'm talking about the whole flying karate kick thing.
Oh...that.
Mr. Lamont said he has never seen anything like it.
how did you do that?
more importantly, why did you do that?
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
nothing makes any sense.
well...
where did you learn how to...
I think-- I think on TV.
something is happening to me, Camille.
my body does things before my brain even knowswhat's happening.
that thing with the tomatoes yesterday.
now this.
it's like...
like what?
I was supposed to be somebody, Camille.
the first person in my family to go to college.
now look at me.
you know what, never mind.
I've been here since last night.
I'm just gonna go home and sleep it off.
Hey, Monica.
everything's gonna be okay.
okay? - Yeah
I hope so.
all right, this is it.
Philadelphia.
this is where molly said we'd find him.
what are you planning, exactly?
I'm not sure.
you're not sure?
he traumatized your girl.
has my mother terrified.
you better get sure.
get your gun out.
come on.
hey...
are you okay?
when I was 13, my father ran out on us.
I haven't talked to him.
I haven't seen him.
I've spent half my life thinking about what I'm gonna say to this guy if I ever got the chance.
and now I can't even knock on the door.
you're welcome.
Parkman, this is not a family reunion.
I know. - Okay.
he's not your dad today.
he is a suspect.
get your gun out.
police! Open up!
who the hell are you?!
I said who the hell are you?!
put the gun down and I'll tell you.
Oh, my god. What are you doing here?
put the gun down.
not till you tell me what the hell you're doing here!
I want to know what you're doing inside molly walker's dreams. - Who?
and what do you know about Kaito Nakamura's murder?
and while we're at it, why Isangela Petrelli protecting you?
wait! What are you, a cop?
right now I'm not, so you better start talking.
I'm good.
you got it all wrong.
that why you're swinging a gun?
because of that.
On--on the desk.
they're gonna kill me too.
tell me about Molly Walker.
she's seen this symbol. She's seen you, and she calls you the nightmare man.
she's looking for me.
Yeah, and she saw you looking back at her, and now she won't wake up.
so whatever you did, undo it now.
sorry, I'm protecting myself.
protecting yourself from who?
which one of her kids are you?
you're the politician, right?
my mother is sitting in jail for Kaito's murder.
they both received similar threats.
both taken from the same picture.
the same photograph.
you were all connected.
your folks, Kaito...
Linderman, me...
we found each other years ago.
we--we thought we could help people.
save the world.
the only thing you've ever wanted to save is your own ass.
still angry, huh, Matt?
feel better?
slapping the cuffs on your dad make you feel good?
Oh, it's starting to, yeah.
this is a waste of time.
just read his mind so we can get the hell out of here.
what did you say?
you can...
read minds?
yeah?
go ahead.
go on.
God!
it's painful, isn't it?
how do you know that?
can you read minds too?
see, matt, you and I, we're not so different after all.
come on, unlock these cuffs.
I'll tell you everything I know.
I promise.
isn't it wonderful?
we've got a musician in the house again.
nobody's touched that thingsince my mother died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nana said I could, but if
Oh, yeah.
it's okay.
please keep playing.
you must really miss your mom.
Yeah, I do.
I miss mine too.
Oh, I'm sure she's fine.
and missing you right back.
she wouldn't even tell me where she was going.
you gotta remembershe cares about you.
I know new things can be scary.
my mom always said god doesn't give us anything we can't handle.
you play piano too?
no.
never learned.
if you don't play, then what was that?
yes?
I've been trying to reach you for hours.
where have you been?
I'm at work. Why?
it's Molly.
she won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.
I'm running out of options here.
take her to the hospital.
and say what?
that she's trapped in a nightmare?
no, I am taking her into the company.
you can't be serious.
these are the people we're fighting against.
Molly won't last. Not like this.
they are the only people who can understand what's happening to her.
don't do this.
the moment you trust them with what you care about most, they'll have you.
don't forget whose side you're on.
I'm on her side.
all right, you gotta tell us everything.
every crime.
everyone you've ever worked with.
everything.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry I left you.
it wasn't easy for me.
don't.
I need to say it.
when I found out I could read minds, it was a temptation, I was weak.
I used people. I was a real scumbag.
you... a cop.
I'm so proud.
you don't get to be proud.
you don't get to be anything.
just answer the questions.
you said you tried to save the world.
how?
these gifts came out of nowhere.
we just found each other, like we were connected somehow.
we thought we were invincible.
a few of us took that to heart.
they started to do whatever they wanted.
I did what I could to stop them.
like what?
this thing we can do, you and I.
it only begins at reading minds.
and then it becomes so much more.
more how?
I--I can't explain it.
no, hang on.
I got something I can show you.
cause it helped me understand it.
Yeah, I got a bunch of stuff from back then.
it's--it's in here.
Oh, come on.
dad?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, what the hell's going on?
where am I?
this is impossible.
we saved the city.
let me out!
it's a mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here.
Yeah, no one's supposed to be here.
pleasant dreams.
Ando Masahashi, Tokyo Japan. Incredible. The ink and parchment look authentic, where did you get these?
they were left to me by a friend these are the the more damaged scrolls I must know what they say please, will you help me?
to be the fist to read these...
I think I can help. Thank you, sir. There we are let's see, shall we?
dear Ando...
it's a common name dear Ando I can't believe I'm helping the legendary Takezo Kensei...
accomplish the very trials I read about as a boy...
batting the "angry ronin," climbing the "frozen waterfall
finding "the single crimson peony
each trial brought us closer to rescuing Yaeko's father...
it's like living in a story book only more tiring you have it?
the final map to white beard's camp?
feudal Japan 1671
now we can find white beard...
and rescue your father it was all going according to plan the rescue...and the blossoming love...
between Kensei and Yaeko
I think I know what happened with the piano.
what can I say?
guess I'm just a musical genius.
or it's something else.
look, it's been a hard couple days for me.
in fact, it's been a hard couple years.
so I think I'm just gonna take a nice long nap, and sleep it off.
do you remember last night when I said I was able to rig the pay-per-view on the TV?
Yeah.
well, I lied.
how did-- how did you.
I think it runs in the family.
I mean, maybe not exactly like me, but.
my dad could walk through walls.
Yeah.
and my mom...
don't even get me started on my mom.
but I think what's going on with you is more like this.
a comic book?
Yeah.
this is saint joan.
she's a muscle mimic.
a what?
a copycat.
whatever she sees, she can do.
that's just like what you did with me and the piano.
a copycat.
copycat.
look at this.
I shouldn't know how to do this.
I saw it on TV.
Oh, my god.
so if this is really happening to you, maybe we ought to go test it out.
I didn't know where else to go.
Oh, you made the right choice.
we're going to do everything we can for Molly.
in the meantime, we have someone else who needs us.
and we would like you to bring her in.
you're sending me into the field?
Yes.
Molly needs me here.
no, no, no. Molly is our top priority here, but we need you out there doing the good work you do, helping others like her.
and, uh, you're gonna need this.
this is how you help people?
by tasering them?
well, that's just standard procedure to make sure everyone's safe.
a lot of the people we encounter aren't in control of their abilities.
but trust me, it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.
Niki's loose, grab her!
down the hall.
grab her.
what the hell is going on here?
so do you want to try something really rad?
like a kick flip?
slam dunk?
well...
I always sucked at double dutch.
you want somethin', lady?
Yeah. I want to jump in.
and don't call me lady.
it's not much.
I sleep in a pub, remember?
you paint?
well, it's what I do to relax.
these are amazing.
you're talented.
is that why you kidnapped me?
so you could sort through me things?
don't start liking me less now that you're peeling away the mystery.
I just...
wanted to see where you lived.
lie on a real bed maybe.
no one's stopping you.
what are you looking at?
nothing.
then what is it that's on your mind?
you were right.
whatever I was, whoever I am...
I have to face it.
nothing that I find in this box is gonna change anything.
whatever my life was before, this is where I want to be now.
with you.
okay?
okay.
get on with it then.
I'm from New York.
looks like you were leaving.
th this is an open ticket, New York to Montreal.
who's that?
I wish I knew.
none of this tells me how I got here.
what I'm supposed to do.
what is it?
Oh, my god, Peter!
you know, I've never been in an Irish pub before.
do you have haggis?
that's Scotland, love.
we have stew.
and muscles.
and stew.
but I'm closing up.
Oh, well...
Yeah, I was hoping you could help me.
I'm looking for a guy.
best time for that's right after a football match.
the fellas are lockedout of their minds.
up for anything.
his name is Peter Petrelli.
never seen him before.
never seen him before?
no.
cool. Thanks.
the thing is, I talked to a few people from the docks.
they said they saw him in here.
I don't know what to tell you.
so either you're lying, or all those other people are lying.
it's just kinda hard to tell who's lying, you know?
like I said...
I don't know this peter.
that it now?
I guess so.
sorry I couldn't be more help.
Yeah.
so am I.
you gave us quite a scare.
I'm sorry about earlier.
I'm feeling much better now.
thank you.
we knew it wouldn'tbe easy.
multiple-personality disorder is a terrible affliction, but we're gonna get you well again.
I promise.
thank you.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I can't leave.
Niki, you're a prisoner.
I'm not.
I came here on my own.
I gave up my son to be here.
I'm sick.
I didn't think anyone could ever understand my problems.
what I've done.
what I'm capable of.
these are the only people that can help me.
Peter, I knew it.
I knew you could survive
you.
you can't run from me, nathan.
baby.
Hey, you've gotta get this baby out of here!
Hey!
what are you doing in here?
is that
is that baby mine?
you said I wasn't the father.
but you read minds.
you looked into my head and you saw the truth, but you still left.
no.
no, I didn't. I didn't know.
you left him.
just like your father left you.
just like you're gonna leave Molly.
no.
no, Janice.
you're no hero.
everybody's dead because of you.
we have to stop it.
you can't.
you don't want redemption.
you want ignorance.
let's go over the edge.
you won't feel anything.
you never do.
you don't know me.
I am you.
stop it, Nathan!
Nathan, wake up!
Nathan...wake up. Nathan, wake up!
Nathan, Wake up!
what happened?
now we know why molly calls him the nightmare man.
you stopped it.
how'd you do that?
I don't know.
Oh, he's gone.
what are you looking for?
we need to know where he went.
why he's doing this.
something to
to what?
I knew this was a con.
I knew I couldn't trust him.
I think I know where he's headed.
that's bob.
he's one of them.
he runs the company.
not for long.
looks like he's next.
but the battle with White Beard was going to put love on hold. According to the map, white beard's camp should be right over this ridge.
we should leave Yaeko here then.
Yaeko, please stay here for your safety. My father taught me well the way of the sword I will fight with you to resure him as you wish...my love we will defeat White Beard together.
right after we defeat his entire army.
Yes, Ando. Tonight we will attack three of us against an army I fear...
these are still too damaged, I need more time. I'm sorry but I must know what happens next with the army! With Yaeko! Does Hiro survive? How would I know?
that is amazing.
Yeah.
I know.
but what do you think it all means?
having these-- these powers.
I think it means that we're special.
but why?
I mean, all this time I've been aying to god to give me direction.
to show me what I'm supposed to do with my life.
of all the things he could give to me...
maybe we're supposed to do something with these.
I just wish I knew what.
it is way past your bedtime.
Hey, this is our little secret.
right?
all right.
I know it's scary at first, but this is a good thing.
I promise.
I'm just looking for some answers.
that's all.
Yes.
I'm Dr. Mohinder Suresh.
may I?
can I help you?
I'm sure you have lots of questions about what's happening to you.
well, I have some answers.
Hi.
Yep.
I'm fine.
weather could be better.
no, not yet, but I will.
he's here.
had to improvise a little, but -
no, I mean, I just had to use a little...
persuasion, that's all.
for-- no, it was just some guy.
and-- all right, I killed him, okay?
what is the big deal?
what do you mean?
now?
this is my assignment.
and I almost have him.
what if I promise not to...
fine.
I'll come home now.
sorry, daddy.
it won't happen again.
what happened?
I don't know.
apparently you're a genius of an artist too.
I painted that? How?
how do you shoot lightning from your hands?
all I know is your eyes went dead, and you couldn't be stopped.
until there was this.
is that us?
I don't know, maybe.
what do you think this is?
a church?
the street signs are in French.
could be Montreal.
like the plane ticket.
Hello?
what?
Oh, my god, Ricky!
look at me. Look at me.
Hey, this is my fault.
okay, they were looking for me.
no, no, no, no...
I'm gonna find 'em, okay?
I'm gonna find 'em.
I can't hide anymore.
I can't hide.
to be continued...
I'll only be gone for a while.
this is your chance at a normal life.
welcome to New Orleans.
is that pay-per-view?
micah's some type of genius and rigged the cable.
I'll take everything you got in the register!
ando, I write to you from the greatest adventure of my life and I've met the most beautiful Japanese woman, has ever seen take off...
your mask, I'm sorry. Ando, I can't come home.
you don't realize how valued you are here at the company.
you're part of the family now.
I'm in over my head.
as long as I'm alive, you will be taken care of.
this here's everything you had on you when we found you.
your box or your life.
you gonna open it, or what?
Hiro nakamura, murdered.
angela petrelli, attacked.
this is my dad.
he may be the killer.
I'll find your father.
Molly, what's the apartment number?
nine - Nine.
good girl. Get out of there right now.
he sees me. - Get out of there.
Molly, please wake up.
when confronted by our worst nightmares, the choices are few: Fight or flight.
we hope to find the strength to stand against our fears.
suresh Parkman Walker, Brooklyn
but sometimes, despite ourselves, we run.
what if the nightmare gives chase?
where can we hide then?
okay, when's she gonna wake up?
I don't know, she's burning up.
all right, we gotta get her to a hospital.
no hospital's equipped to deal with this.
you really think my father did this to her in her nightmare?
she used her ability to find him for you, and slipped into this.
she was so afraid.
I never should have asked her to look for him.
no, you shouldn't have.
but now you know where he is.
I can't just leave her like this.
you have to.
if your father did something to her, you need to find out what and how to end it.
you have an address in philadelphia.
she even saw his door.
I haven't seen the man in 25 years.
Molly faced her worst nightmare for you.
do the same for her.
find him.
I'll stay here with her.
I'll do everything I can.
I don't even know what I'm dealing with.
why was he in that photo?
she knows him.
you're gonna be okay.
I promise.
I was about to lock up when this guy showed.
he pushed his way in, shoved a gun in my face.
next thing I know he's flying through that glass.
Monica Dawson, New Orleans.
you hit an armed man?
I guess.
could've been a kick.
I don't know, it all happened so fast.
is this the guy?
his name is Lonny Stills.
he's a local gangbanger.
he's already hit three other fast food joints in the area this month.
it fits his M.O.
like I said, it's all a blur.
look, I know you don't want to be a snitch.
it's dangerous.
but in order for me to get this guy off the street,
I need somebody to step up and I.D. him.
be a hero.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
I can't help a neighborhood that won't help itself.
if you change your mind, you give me a call.
Peter Petrelli Cork, Ireland. you closing up already?
it's the middle of the afternoon.
I need a break.
I could get used to this.
right, a guy who can throw 1, 000 volts our of either hand...
settling for everyday life in a pub in cork.
I'm not sure it suits you.
why not?
Peter, just because you don't remember your past, it doesn't mean you don't have one.
aren't you curious about who you are, or where you come from?
you've seen what I can do.
there's a side of me that I can't control.
maybe it's best if I don't dig too deep.
I know the kind of man you are.
even if you don't.
there's only good in you.
and I bet whatever's in that box will tell you the same thing.
weren't you the one who didn't want me to look in that box?
I only said that because you hadn't kissed me yet.
now that you have, you done with me?
gettin' there.
after all, a pretty boy like you, there's bound to be someone looking for you.
friends.
a girlfriend.
let 'em look.
like I told you, you're not gonna find him in there.
but you're sure it was him?
Yeah.
found him cuffed inside there a few nights back.
poor sap.
didn't know how he got there.
didn't even know his own name.
do you know where he is now?
depends.
who's askin'?
just me.
I work for a company interested in keeping him out of trouble.
Peter is a... dangerous guy.
you don't have to tell me that.
he's in town.
place called wandering rocks pub.
Hey, if he's so dangerous, sweetheart, why'd they send a little girl like you in all alone?
I can take care of myself.
bring her back to holding.
Petrelli parkman manhattan police station
what do you think you're doing interrogating my mother without me there?
relax.
she didn't give me anything.
of course she didn't give you anything.
these people protect each other.
my mother's not a killer.
I'm not gonna have her sit in jail for a crime she didn't commit.
neither am I.
that's why I'm going to philadelphia to see my father, figure this whole thing out.
let me come with you. - No!
you're not a cop.
listen, I'm guessing this isn't official police business.
so if I'm there, it won't really make a difference.
because officially, neither are you.
you don't understand.
it's molly.
my father did something to her.
she's in trouble.
what do you mean "did something to her"?
come here.
did what?
he got inside her head somehow.
I don't know how he did it, but I think it's all connected.
to Kaito.
to your mother.
it could be dangerous.
I can take care of myself.
listen, I have to do this.
let me come with you.
fine.
we can probably get there faster.
you know, 'cause you can, uh...
Oh, please.
I need to talk to him.
alone.
tell him what you told me.
this american girl...
she's hitting all the boys on the dock, looking for a certain shipping container.
she say what she wanted?
Yeah.
you.
don't worry.
I think I can help.
this is my problem.
not given what I just saw between you and my sister.
you care about her, don't you?
right now, she's the only thing in my life that means something.
Caitlin has a flat up the hill.
go there and stay until I call you.
I'll take care of your friend.
I could handle this myself.
I don't doubt it.
I've seen what you can do.
but I've got an investment in you now.
some little blonde's isn't going to scare me off.
now go on.
and don't be telling caitlin about any of this.
she'll only worry sick.
well?
well, what?
well, are you gonna tell me what that was all about?
uh, I just didn't want some crackhead looking for revenge.
so I said I didn't recognize him.
no, not that.
I'm talking about the whole flying karate kick thing.
Oh...that.
Mr. Lamont said he has never seen anything like it.
how did you do that?
more importantly, why did you do that?
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
nothing makes any sense.
well...
where did you learn how to...
I think-- I think on TV.
something is happening to me, camille.
my body does things before my brain even knows what's happening.
that thing with the tomatoes yesterday.
now this.
it's like...
like what?
I was supposed to be somebody, Camille.
the first person in my family to go to college.
now look at me.
you know what, never mind.
I've been here since last night.
I'm just gonna go home and sleep it off.
Hey, Monica.
everything's gonna be okay.
okay? - Yeah
I hope so.
all right, this is it.
Philadelphia.
this is where molly said we'd find him.
what are you planning, exactly?
I'm not sure.
you're not sure?
he traumatized your girl.
has my mother terrified.
you better get sure.
get your gun out.
come on.
hey...
are you okay?
when I was 13, my father ran out on us.
I haven't talked to him.
I haven't seen him.
I've spent half my life thinking about what I'm gonna say to this guy if I ever got the chance.
and now I can't even knock on the door.
you're welcome.
Parkman, this is not a family reunion.
I know. - Okay.
he's not your dad today.
he is a suspect.
get your gun out.
police! Open up!
who the hell are you?!
I said who the hell are you?!
put the gun down and I'll tell you.
Oh, my god. What are you doing here?
put the gun down.
not till you tell me what the hell you're doing here!
I want to know what you're doing inside Molly Walker's dreams. - Who?
and what do you know about Kaito Nakamura's murder?
and while we're at it, why Isangela Petrelli protecting you?
wait! What are you, a cop?
right now I'm not, so you better start talking.
I'm good.
you got it all wrong.
that why you're swinging a gun?
because of that.
On--on the desk.
they're gonna kill me too.
tell me about Molly Walker.
she's seen this symbol. She's seen you, and she calls you the nightmare man.
she's looking for me.
Yeah, and she saw you looking back at her, and now she won't wake up.
so whatever you did, undo it now.
sorry, I'm protecting myself.
protecting yourself from who?
which one of her kids are you?
you're the politician, right?
my mother is sitting in jail for Kaito's murder.
they both received similar threats.
both taken from the same picture.
the same photograph.
you were all connected.
your folks, Kaito...
Linderman, me...
we found each other years ago.
we--we thought we could help people.
save the world.
the only thing you've ever wanted to save is your own ass.
still angry, huh, Matt?
feel better?
slapping the cuffs on your dad make you feel good?
Oh, it's starting to, yeah.
this is a waste of time.
just read his mind so we can get the hell out of here.
what did you say?
read minds?
yeah?
go ahead.
go on.
God!
it's painful, isn't it?
how do you know that?
can you read minds too?
see, Matt, you and I, we're not so different after all.
come on, unlock these cuffs.
I'll tell you everything I know.
I promise.
isn't it wonderful?
we've got a musician in the house again.
nobody's touched that thing since my mother died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nana said I could, but if
Oh, yeah.
it's okay.
please keep playing.
you must really miss your mom.
Yeah, I do.
I miss mine too.
Oh, I'm sure she's fine.
and missing you right back.
she wouldn't even tell me where she was going.
you gotta remember she cares about you.
I know new things can be scary.
my mom always said god doesn't give us anything we can't handle.
you play piano too?
no.
never learned.
if you don't play, then what was that?
yes?
I've been trying to reach you for hours.
where have you been?
I'm at work. Why?
it's Molly.
she won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.
I'm running out of options here.
take her to the hospital.
and say what?
that she's trapped in a nightmare?
no, I am taking her into the company.
you can't be serious.
these are the people we're fighting against.
Molly won't last. Not like this.
don't do this.
the moment you trust them with what you care about most, they'll have you.
don't forget whose side you're on.
I'm on her side.
all right, you gotta tell us everything.
every crime.
everyone you've ever worked with.
everything.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry I left you.
it wasn't easy for me.
don't.
I need to say it.
when I found out I could read minds, it was a temptation, I was weak.
I used people. I was a real scumbag.
you... a cop.
I'm so proud.
you don't get to be proud.
you don't get to be anything.
just answer the questions.
you said you tried to save the world.
how?
these gifts came out of nowhere.
we just found each other, like we were connected somehow.
we thought we were invincible.
a few of us took that to heart.
they started to do whatever they wanted.
I did what I could to stop them.
like what?
this thing we can do, you and I.
it only begins at reading minds.
and then it becomes so much more.
more how?
I--I can't explain it.
no, hang on.
I got something I can show you.
cause it helped me understand it.
Yeah, I got a bunch of stuff from back then.
it's--it's in here.
Oh, come on.
dad?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, what the hell's going on?
where am I?
this is impossible.
we saved the city.
let me out!
it's a mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here.
Yeah, no one's supposed to be here.
pleasant dreams.
Ando Masahashi, Tokyo Japan. Incredible. The ink and parchment look authentic, where did you get these?
they were left to me by a friend. These are the the more damaged scrolls. I must know what they say. Please, will you help me?
to be the fist to read these...
I think I can help. Thank you, sir. There we are let's see, shall we?
dear Ando...
it's a common name Dear Ando I can't believe i'm helping the legendary Takezo Kensei...
accomplish the very trials I read about as a boy...
batting the "angry ronin," climbing the "frozen waterfall.
finding "the single crimson peony.
each trial brought us closer to rescuing yaeko's father...

feudal japan 1671.
now we can find white beard...
and rescue your father it was all going according to plan the rescue...and the blossoming love...
between Kensei and Yaeko.
I think I know what happened with the piano.
what can I say?
guess I'm just a musical genius.
or it's something else.
look, it's been a hard couple days for me.
in fact, it's been a hard couple years.
so I think I'm just gonna take a nice long nap, and sleep it off.
do you remember last night when I said I was able to rig the pay-per-view on the tv?
Yeah.
well, I lied.
how did-- how did you?
I think it runs in the family.
I mean, maybe not exactly like me, but。
my dad could walk through walls.
Yeah.
and my mom...
don't even get me started on my mom.
but I think what's going on with you is more like this.
a comic book?
Yeah.
she's a muscle mimic.
a what?
whatever she sees, she can do.
that's just like what you did with me and the piano.
a copycat.
copycat.
look at this.
I shouldn't know how to do this.
I saw it on TV.
Oh, my god.
so if this is really happening to you, maybe we ought to go test it out.
I didn't know where else to go.
Oh, you made the right choice.
we're going to do everything we can for Molly.
in the meantime, we have someone else who needs us.
and we would like you to bring her in.
you're sending me into the field?
Yes.
Molly needs me here.
no, no, no. Molly is our top priority here, but we need you out there doing the good work you do, helping others like her.
and, uh, you're gonna need this.
this is how you help people?
by tasering them?
well, that's just standard procedure to make sure everyone's safe.
a lot of the people we encounter aren't in control of their abilities.
but trust me, it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.
Niki's loose, grab her!
down the hall.
what the hell is going on here?
so do you want to try something really rad?
like a kick flip?
slam dunk?
well...
I always sucked at double dutch.
you want somethin', lady?
Yeah. I want to jump in.
and don't call me lady.
it's not much.
I sleep in a pub, remember?
you paint?
well, it's what I do to relax.
these are amazing.
you're talented.
is that why you kidnapped me?
so you could sort through me things?
don't start liking me less now that you're peeling away the mystery.
I just...
wanted to see where you lived.
lie on a real bed maybe.
no one's stopping you.
what are you looking at?
nothing.
then what is it that's on your mind?
you were right.
whatever I was, whoever I am...
I have to face it.
nothing that I find in this box is gonna change anything.
whatever my life was before, this is where I want to be now.
with you.
okay?
okay.
get on with it then.
I'm from New York.
looks like you were leaving.
this is an open ticket, New York to Montreal.
who's that?
I wish I knew.
none of this tells me how I got here.
what I'm supposed to do.
what is it?
Oh, my god, Peter!
you know, I've never been in an Irish pub before.
do you have haggis?
that's Scotland, love.
we have stew.
and muscles.
and stew.
but I'm closing up.
Oh, well...
I was hoping you could help me.
I'm looking for a guy.
best time for that's right after a football match.
the fellas are lockedout of their minds.
up for anything.
his name is Peter Petrelli.
never seen him before.
never seen him before?
no.
cool. Thanks.
the thing is, I talked to a few people from the docks.
they said they saw him in here.
I don't know what to tell you.
so either you're lying, or all those other people are lying.
it's just kinda hard to tell who's lying, you know?
like I said...
I don't know this Peter.
that it now?
I guess so.
sorry, I couldn't be more help.
Yeah.
so am I.
you gave us quite a scare.
I'm sorry about earlier.
I'm feeling much better now.
thank you.
we knew it wouldn't be easy.
multiple-personality disorder is a terrible affliction, but we're gonna get you well again.
I promise.
thank you.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I can't leave.
Niki, you're a prisoner.
I'm not.
I came here on my own.
I gave up my son to be here.
I'm sick.
I didn't think anyone could ever understand my problems.
what I've done.
what I'm capable of.
these are the only people that can help me.
Peter, I knew it.
I knew you could survive.
you.
you can't run from me, Nathan.
baby.
Hey, you've gotta get this baby out of here!
Hey!
what are you doing in here?
is that
is that baby mine?
you said I wasn't the father.
but you read minds.
you looked into my head and you saw the truth, but you still left.
no.
no, I didn't. I didn't know.
you left him.
just like your father left you.
just like you're gonna leave Molly.
no.
no, Janice.
you're no hero.
everybody's dead because of you.
we have to stop it.
you can't.
you don't want redemption.
you want ignorance.
let's go over the edge.
you won't feel anything.
you never do.
you don't know me.
I am you.
stop it, Nathan!
Nathan, wake up!
Nathan...wake up. Nathan, wake up!
Nathan, Wake up!
what happened?
now we know why Molly calls him the nightmare man.
you stopped it.
how'd you do that?
I don't know.
Oh, he's gone.
what are you looking for?
we need to know where he went.
why he's doing this.
something to
to what?
I knew this was a con.
I knew I couldn't trust him.
I think I know where he's headed.
that's bob.
he's one of them.
he runs the company.
not for long.
looks like he's next.
and save Yaeko's father History was back on track...
but the battle with White Beard was going to put love on hold. According to the map, white beard's camp should be right over this ridge.
we should leave Yaeko here then.
Yaeko, please stay here for your safety. My father taught me well the way of the sword I will fight with you to resure him as you wish...my love we will defeat White Beard together.
right after we defeat his entire army.
Yes, Ando. Tonight we will attack three of us against an army I fear...
fear" what?
what's next?
I can't read the next words!
these are still too damaged, I need more time. I'm sorry but I must know what happens next with the army!
with Yaeko!
does Hiro survive?
how would I know?
that is amazing.
Yeah.
I know.
but what do you think it all means?
having these-- these powers.
I think it means that we're special.
I mean, all this time I've been aying to god to give me direction.
to show me what I'm supposed to do with my life.
of all the things he could give to me...
maybe we're supposed to do something with these.
I just wish I knew what.
it is way past your bedtime.
Hey, this is our little secret.
right?
all right.
I know it's scary at first, but this is a good thing.
I promise.
I'm just looking for some answers.
that's all.
Yes.
I'm Dr. Mohinder Suresh.
may I?
can I help you?
I'm sure you have lots of questions about what's happening to you.
well, I have some answers.
Hi.
Yep.
I'm fine.
weather could be better.
no, not yet, but I will.
he's here.
had to improvise a little, but -
no, I mean, I just had to use a little...
persuasion, that's all.
for-- no, it was just some guy.
and-- all right, I killed him, okay?
what is the big deal?
what do you mean?
now?
and I almost have him.
what if I promise not to...'
fine.
I'll come home now.
sorry, daddy.
it won't happen again.
what happened?
I don't know.
apparently you're a genius of an artist too.
I painted that? How?
how do you shoot lightning from your hands?
all I know is your eyes went dead, and you couldn't be stopped.
until there was this.
is that us?
I don't know, maybe.
what do you think this is?
a church?
the street signs are in French.
could be Montreal.
like the plane ticket.
Hello?
what?
Oh, my god, Ricky!
look at me. Look at me.
Hey, this is my fault.
okay, they were looking for me.
no, no, no, no...
I'm gonna find 'em, okay?
I'm gonna find 'em.
I can't hide anymore.
I can't hide.
to be continued...
thank god you came along.
I know Dr. Suresh.
I can take you to him.
we will defeat White Beard together.
right after we defeat his entire army.
she won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.
I am taking her to the company.
the moment you trust them with what you care about most, they'll have you.
we have someone else who needs us.
we would like you to bring her in.
a lot of the people we encounter aren't in control of their ability.
but we need you out there, doing the good work that you do helping others like her.
you were with a boy.
there's no boy, dad.
I tried out for cheerleading.
but you promise me that you won't date.
okay.
I painted that, but all the street signs are in French.
it could be Montreal.
the woman who did this to Ricky, she was looking for me.
chapter six "the line"
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have let him cover for me.
it was his choice, Peter.
my brother could be a right fool sometimes.
the woman who killed Ricky, she was looking for me.
you saw what she could do.
I'm not gonna let you be next.
I'm gonna find her, find out who she is, what she wants.
how are you planning on doing that?
the plane ticket, the painting.
it all points to Montreal.
it's a start.
I'm going with you.
no.
I'm not risking your life too.
we were both in that Montreal painting.
I think I'm supposed to go with you, Peter.
besides, when you find Ricky's killer, I want to be there.
what for?
to kill the bitch.
it's our planet, let's plant a tree!
go, Costa Verde!
stop, please!
I can't take it anymore.
do you realize how agonizing it is to watch you people?
it's a no on all three.
next!
are you crazy?
Claire was awesome.
I vote yes.
okay, that's one vote for Claire.
anyone else care to climb out on a limb with May?
like I said, next!
thanks for trying.
Claire, you were amazing.
really.
I don't know what Debbie's thinking.
what I'm thinking is that Costa Verde high deserves cheerleaders that are extraordinary.
and you, Claire, are simply not extraordinary.
how was that?
perfect yet again.
how much longer are we gonna do this?
it's been hours.
I want to go home.
soon, I promise.
let's take a break.
are you ever gonna tell me what's going on here?
where are we? I mean, you just grabbed me off the street
you're in Hartsdale, New York, at a privately funded company whose sole purpose is to help you and others like you.
others like me?
not exactly like you.
others have different gifts, but you're the first we've met with adoptive muscle memory.
so that's what it's called.
why is this happening to me?
we're not really sure.
there are certain genetic markers, but where they come from is still a mystery.
you have been given an extraordinary gift.
I agree.
you are a very special person, Miss Dawson.
who are you?
my name is Bob.
I'm in charge of operations.
doctor, could I see you for a moment?
have you established a reliable baseline for Miss Dawson's ability?
Yes. She is able to replicate any action.
it's really quite extraordinary.
good.
now, we could determine if this stops all of that.
what is that?
a variant of the shanti virus.
you're experimenting with the virus?
manipulating a live virus is essential for creating a vaccine, Doctor.
we hope to use this virus to take away Monica's ability without harming her.
you could create an incurable strain.
it could cross over to the general population.
think how many people were killed by Gabriel Gray.
there are some abilities in this world that must be stopped at any cost.
Monica is a sweet girl who loves her abilities.
we can't just take them away from her.
it's for the greater good.
so she's a lab rat.
you're just going to inject her without her consent.
no, Dr. Suresh, you are.
it's a mutated strain, manufactured.
if the biological structure of the virus has been altered,
I don't know if I can save her.
she could die.
you're just gonna have to take that chance.
I never agreed to experiment on people.
you brought them Molly, didn't you?
I didn't know what else to do.
all right, look.
if you refuse to do this, they're gonna get rid of you, and then we're gonna lose everything that we've been trying to do.
and worse yet, you're gonna lose Molly.
now you've got principles, and that's fine.
but to bring down this company, sometimes we have to do bad things.
don't disappoint me, Suresh.
kolya? We'll be late for the party.
so handsome.
here.
let grandma...
what time will you be home?
three o'clock.
unless there's candy.
then I make no promises.
my old friend.
we need to talk.
something wrong?
I lied to my dad.
the other night when I went home, I told him I'd joined cheerleading.
cheerleading?
that is bad.
you don't understand.
cheerleading tryouts were last period.
I didn't make it.
what am I supposed to tell him?
you met this awesome guy, and you need some free time to make out.
I told you my dad's really overprotective about the whole dating thing.
he told me I couldn't date until I was 21.
so?
so I have to listen to my parents. Don't you?
Claire, I can fly.
it kind of makes the whole parental guidance thing a non-issue.
but if it's that important to you, we'll figure out a way to get you on the team.
it's impossible.
Debbie Marshall does not deem me extraordinary enough.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
you're a total babe, and you have a power.
by definition, you're better than she is.
Oh, you're sweet.
but it's not just her.
she's got that whole squad wrapped around her evil little pinky.
I knew girls just like her at my old school.
all would take is one person to stand up to her.
well, be that person.
take her down a notch.
how?
you were a cheerleader.
what do they fear most?
public humiliation?
we could give her a taste of her own medicine.
your ability is fascinating.
a gift.
what I do is terrible.
I have taken many lives, and I can't control it.
I was like you.
I could do things, amazing things.
you?
like what?
I could move objects with my mind.
I could hear a pin drop from miles away.
but then it all just.
went away.
that's why I need to see Dr. Suresh, to get them back.
you want to be different?
I want to be special, unique.
an ability doesn't have to be a burden, Maya.
it can be wonderful.
stop at the next gas station I need to find a coyote to take us across what?
what about Gabriel?
I don't trust him, Maya I see the way he looks at you why is he still there?
is there a problem?
my brother wants to hire a coyote, to cross the border without you.
Why?
you can't trust them.
God delivered Gabriel to us, Aleiandro we should put your faith in him.
it's okay.
we'll cross the border together.
I'm glad to have found you, Gabriel.
you started without me?
sorry. It's just so compelling.
Hiro and Kensei made it to White Beard's camp. See?
stop!
you can't skip ahead!
I must know every detail.
start where we left off!
okay.
okay.
tonight, we will attack...
...three fo us against an army.
but even with powers, I fear for the swordsmith's life.
and for Yaeko...
the woman I love, but cannot have you should reconsider.
rescuing your father will be dangerous.
so long as Kensei fights at my side, I fear nothing.
but I'm concerned. How will we find my father among all these tents?
the story.
Kensei trailed smoke to flame and found White Beard's treasure.
there the tent that smolders.
the tent that smolders?
this is no time for lucky guesses.
my father's life is at stake.
you're right.
I am sorry.
tell me, Hiro why are you still here?
why do you risk your life for my father?
it's gonna be some fight!
did you find my father?
Yes, my love. In the tent that smolders.
you were right, Yaeko.
we have nothing to fear with Kensei around!
come on painted a series of eight paintings beginning with Kaito Nakamura's death and ending in mine.
where are they?
sorry, I'm retired.
I work in the textile factory now.
regional manager of sales, like you in the paper company.
cut the crap.
where are the paintings?
you think you intimidate me?
I trained you, you and your invisible partner Claude.
I taught you everything!
then you know what I'm capable of.
don't make me do this.
what is this?
you want information?
the haitian can't help you.
my friend has a new trick.
he can reach inside that company-loving head of yours and one by one, blot out all the memories you hold most dear.
think about it, a man of your advanced years.
treasured memories give your life meaning.
your wedding in Capri.
the births of Andre and Mikhail.
it'd be a shame if they disappeared, lost forever.
you...
I am...
you...
start with the day he met his wife.
a boat ride on the Danube, wasn't it?
a tell me about Katarina.
your honeymoon.
her favorite flower.
I can't remember.
Really?
after 35 years together, such a shame.
are you ready to talk, or do we keep going?
go.
Hi, honey.
is everything all right?
Hey, dad, yeah.
I was just wondering if I could borrow the car tonight.
did you ask your mother?
I did, and she said to ask you.
I'm gonna be with the cheerleaders later.
just thought you should know.
full disclosure and all.
well, that's very responsible of you, Claire.
take the car.
but do one thing for me.
sure.
lock the doors this time.
I will. Thanks.
is there something else?
where are you right now?
I told you.
management training in Tulsa.
and I'm late for a session.
well, I thought you had to work there a year before they'd send you.
I'm a quick learner.
I've gotta go.
I love you, Claire-bear.
I love you too, dad.
what do you think?
okay.
I'm in.
your daughter Claire?
it must be very difficult for her, the constant fear of discovery, especially for a teenager.
aren't you tired of running?
I'm protecting her from animals like you.
you can't hide forever.
take all his memories of me, my family, Claire, everything I ever told him.
he remembers nothing!
wait!
I'm like you.
family comes first.
maybe we can make a deal.
what kind of deal?
you were my protege, so dedicated to the company, you made me proud.
I miss that.
I want you back. - Forget it.
the company has changed.
we have new directives.
come back to us and you'll be safe, all of you.
you have my word.
what about the paintings?
you'll be told everything.
I can give you your life back.
trust me.
what is that?
a border fence, not finished yet.
that is America right there.
Alejandro, we made it!
that's the United States!
attention, you're in violation of U. S.Immigration!
we have notified border patrol.
all right, boys, andale, andale.
let's see them hands.
who are they?
they're locals, not border patrol.
they're fake police. Just drive around them.
God help us.
what's--what's that for?
a cholinergic.
it's standard procedure to see if your ability improves.
uh-uh, no way.
I won't do needles.
it's the last phase of your testing.
one shot, you can go home.
fine.
just make it fast.
I can't do this.
Dr. Suresh?
I won't do it.
if you don't, someone else will.
and there's more where that came from.
stop! What are you doing?
get someone else to do your research.
I'm taking Molly, and I'm leaving.
all right, boys, this is your last warning.
we have to go. - They will shoot us.
we never should have listened to him...
Alejandro, stop!
just drive, now!
it's happening.
give me your hand...
no, no, no, no, no.
let her alone.
what are you doing? You'll die.
we need to get past these men, these guns.
you can use your gift.
Maya! Take my hand. Hurry...
no.
what are you doing?! Maya!
drive.
the next time you think of that second helping of chunky monkey, remember one thing.
the sharpie doesn't lie.
appearance matters, girls.
is this really necessary?
hell, yes.
I might have to basket catch one of these tubettes.
Debbie, can I talk to you for a minute?
private function, butler.
cheerleaders only.
I'll do your biology homework for a week.
you have five minutes.
I want another chance, another shot at tryouts.
I appreciate the effort, really.
attempting to better your social status at school is very American dream of you.
but everyone has their place in this world.
deal with it.
so you're not gonna change your mind?
you are slow, aren't you?
Oh, my god.
she was right there.
her neck was twisted. She was bleeding.
I went to see if I could help her, and that's when he came after me.
the flying masked man? - Yes!
I escaped, thank goodness, but Claire was dead, right there on the steps. I saw her.
she's.
what's going on?
but I saw you. That thing dropped you.
Debbie, calm down. I'm fine.
I don't supposed you saw a.
flying masked man this evening?
me? No. No.
uh, I was just hanging out with Debbie.
find anything, Ray? - No dead bodies.
I did find this.
how much have you had to drink tonight, miss Marshall?
we don't have much time. The sun will rise soon.
Yaeko's father is there.
you take out the guard, we will follow.
you've given me purpose, carp.
I'm really a hero.
and more, you've made me a better man.
you wouldn't happen to have a swordsmith in there, would you?
No...this can't be.
I know. It's really unfair.
that was easy enough.
Yaeko?! I had stopped hoping.
father! We came to save you!
I am Hiro.
and this is the great swordsman Takezo Kensei.
he has come to save you.
Kensei?
I thought you were a drunk.
turns out. I'm a hero.
Kensei! Cut my father's chains.
I cannot leave.
white beard has built an arsenal.
of guns. Thousands.
I must destroy them.
guns are not allowed in Japan.
not yet anyway.
they are here...because of me.
I told White Beard how to make them.
white Beard said.
if I did not help him.
he'd kill you, my daughter.
he plans to overthrow the emperor.
if White Beard uses guns it would end the way of the sword and the samurai.
you must stop them.
destroy all the guns! That is how you save Japan.
very well.
Kensei has a plan. He will smash the guns.
we must go now.
the sun is rising can I speak with you for a moment?
I owe you an apology.
what I asked you to do was wrong.
I've been with the company for 30 years.
we've been through a lot of turmoil and made a lot of difficult choices, some I regret to this day.
but right now I'm dealing with someone who is a real danger to us, to everyone, and I'm afraid that in my haste to deal with him,
I overstepped my bounds.
the file you were holding, Adam Monroe.
Yes.
you're valuable to us, Dr. Suresh, not just for your blood or your knowledge, but to keep us in line.
Molly still isn't well, so I can't take her away from here.
but you've given me no reason to trust you.
I know, I know.
we both have a lot at stake.
I have someone at my disposal, someone who can make sure there's no further misunderstandings.
sound good?
I don't really have a choice, do I?
the Swordsmith escapes.
what happened?
what have you done?
how did we get here, Hiro?
I don't know.
we should find Kensei.
he'll explain everything.
no.
you did it.
you held me.
and then we were here.
you can move people from one plave to another.
You...with a mask.
it was you, Hiro.
all this time.
it was you that did those amazing things.
I only wanted to fix history.
you saved me from the brigands.
you were the one under the cherry blossoms.
do you...
love me, Hiro?
I do.
very much.
everything I loves in Kensei came from you.
but the spave/time continuum...
it was the kiss that fractured time.
it changed me forever, Ando.
Where's the rest of it?
that's it, the end.
the last scroll.
there has to be more!
my friend is not back yet.
please.
sorry.
stop.
I did what I had to do. For all of us.
listen to what you're saying.
you're a killer, because of him.
I won't do this.
you have to choose.
either he goes...
or I do.
don't Alejandro.
we need Gabriel.
he can take us to Dr. Suresh.
to salvation.
fine, he can stay.
but the next time your eyes blacken.
don't look for my hand.
it won't be there.
I will let him die.
I will get something for your lip.
I know you don't understand me.
but I want to tell you why I'm helping you.
it's that delicious power.
you see, when I get my ability back, I'm gonna kill you.
and your sister.
and I'm gonna take it all.
and if I don't get my ability back, it's not a total loss.
Maya's learning quickly.
she's a shiny new toy, and she's all mine.
I can't believe you talked me into that.
what?
somebody could have seen us.
relax. No one saw.
and no one will ever believe Debbie.
did you see her face?
classic.
is she gonna be okay?
definitely.
she freaked, but just think of it as a lesson in humility.
hope I'm not interrupting. - No, it's okay. How's Debbie?
she blew a 13.
drinking on school grounds.
got suspended from the cheerleading squad immediately.
which means we have an opening.
first practice is Monday after school.
you mean it? I'm on the team? - Sure.
you were the best at try-outs.
I'll just let you two get back to.
whatever. I'll see you Monday.
tell me something, Ivan.
in all the years I've known you, why have you never mentioned a daughter?
this daughter.
she died, didn't she?
leukemia. - I'm so sorry.
that must have been so painful.
I can't even imagine losing Claire.
to think.
all you have left of her are your memories.
it would be awful if they were taken.
almost as if she never existed.
please don't. - Take the daughter. Don't leave anything.
wait!
it's in the warehouse near the train yard.
where we tagged the liquid man.
you'll find your paintings there.
thank you.
now what?
your haitian friend makes sure that'll I'll forget that you were ever here?
I wish it were that easy.
once the company discovers your memory loss, they're gonna trace it back to the haitian, which leads to my family.
and I can't have it. - What are you doing?
you taught me well, my friend.
you said,"make it look as if you were never there."
so now we weren't.
instead, there was a simple home invasion, - a senseless murder. - I am offering you a way out.
you can stop running!
shoot me and there is no turning back.
you'll condemn yourself to hell.
I know.
Kensei, I've been searching for hours.
come, my friend.
we must go back and destroy whitebeard's guns.
if you want to stop him, do it yourself.
something wrong?
I saw you, Hiro.
after I saved the swordsmith, I came after you, afraid something had happened to Yaeko, because I love her.
and you, friend, betrayed me. - No.
Yes. You kissed her.
it happened.
by accident. - You accidentally kissed her?
I accidentally fell in love with her, and she with me.
I'm so sorry.
so you've been lying to me all along.
first you show me that I can be harmed by no weapon, and then you cut me deeper than any blade possibly could.
she's your princess, Kensei.
I know that.
and I swear I will not give in to love.
that kiss will be our last.
but the fate of the world still rests in our hands.
we must stop whitebeard.
all right, carp.
let's go.
nicely done, for this Takezo Kensei.
whatever you desire shall be yours.
you're covered at work and at home, an impromptu burger bonanza training seminar at corporate.
here.
what's this? - Information. Phone numbers.
if you have any questions or concerns,
I want you to call us anytime, day or night.
also, here.
it's fully loaded.
anything from martial arts to plumbing, any skill you want is now at your fingertips.
Wow.
support, advice, and now gifts.
you're like my own personal Oprah.
you have an amazing gift.
so look around.
seems to me like this town could use a little amazing.
Thanks.
right.
Hello, Dr. Suresh.
Niki? How are you?
I'm feeling better now.
back to my old self, thanks to the company.
in fact, I'm gonna be working with them for a while.
so you're - your new partner.
I know.
it's the last place that I expected to be, but.
I owe these people so much.
Bob told me that you two were having some trust issues.
he just wants me to make sure that there's no more misunderstandings.
that's okay, isn't it?
warehouse Odessa, Ukraine
what does it mean?
montreal, Canada - Are you ready? - Yeah.
what is this place?
I don't know.
someone knew I was coming.
we were right about the company.
the world is in danger. It's up to us. Adam.
the name Adam doesn't ring a bell?
no, and I don't know about any company.
I don't know about any of this.
the world is in danger.
what am I supposed to do?
we'll figure it out.
please tell me who I am, what the future holds.
Peter, how did we？
I don't know.
we're in New York.
where is everyone?
it's an evacuation order.
june 14, 2008.
this is next year.
thank god you came along.
I know Dr. Suresh.
I can take you to him.
we will defeat White Beard together.
right after we defeat his entire army.
she won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.
I am taking her to the company.
the moment you trust them with what you care about most, they'll have you.
we have someone else who needs us.
we would like you to bring her in.
a lot of the people we encounter aren't in control of their ability.
but we need you out there, doing the good work that you do helping others like her.
you were with a boy.
there's no boy, dad.
I tried out for cheerleading.
but you promise me that you won't date.
okay.
I painted that, but all the street signs are in French.
it could be Montreal.
the woman who did this to Ricky, she was looking for me.
chapter six "the line"
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have let him cover for me.
it was his choice, Peter.
my brother could be a right fool sometimes.
the woman who killed Ricky, she was looking for me.
you saw what she could do.
I'm not gonna let you be next.
I'm gonna find her, find out who she is, what she wants.
how are you planning on doing that?
the plane ticket, the painting.
it all points to Montreal.
it's a start.
I'm going with you.
no.
I'm not risking your life too.
we were both in that Montreal painting.
I think I'm supposed to go with you, Peter.
besides, when you find Ricky's killer, I want to be there.
what for?
to kill the bitch.
it's our planet, let's plant a tree!
go, Costa Verde!
stop, please!
I can't take it anymore.
do you realize how agonizing it is to watch you people?
it's a no on all three.
next!
are you crazy?
Claire was awesome.
I vote yes.
okay, that's one vote for Claire.
anyone else care to climb out on a limb with May?
like I said, next!
thanks for trying.
Claire, you were amazing.
really.
I don't know what Debbie's thinking.
what I'm thinking is that Costa Verde high deserves cheerleaders that are extraordinary.
and you, Claire, are simply not extraordinary.
how was that?
perfect yet again.
how much longer are we gonna do this?
it's been hours.
I want to go home.
soon, I promise.
let's take a break.
are you ever gonna tell me what's going on here?
where are we? I mean, you just grabbed me off the street
you're in Hartsdale, New York, at a privately funded company whose sole purpose is to help you and others like you.
others like me?
not exactly like you.
others have different gifts, but you're the first we've met with adoptive muscle memory.
so that's what it's called.
why is this happening to me?
we're not really sure.
there are certain genetic markers, but where they come from is still a mystery.
you have been given an extraordinary gift.
I agree.
you are a very special person, Miss Dawson.
who are you?
my name is Bob.
I'm in charge of operations.
doctor, could I see you for a moment?
have you established a reliable baseline for Miss Dawson's ability?
Yes. She is able to replicate any action.
it's really quite extraordinary.
good.
now, we could determine if this stops all of that.
what is that?
a variant of the shanti virus.
you're experimenting with the virus?
manipulating a live virus is essential for creating a vaccine, Doctor.
we hope to use this virus to take away Monica's ability without harming her.
you could create an incurable strain.
it could cross over to the general population.
think how many people were killed by Gabriel Gray.
there are some abilities in this world that must be stopped at any cost.
Monica is a sweet girl who loves her abilities.
we can't just take them away from her.
it's for the greater good.
so she's a lab rat.
you're just going to inject her without her consent.
no, Dr. Suresh, you are.
it's a mutated strain, manufactured.
if the biological structure of the virus has been altered,
I don't know if I can save her.
she could die.
you're just gonna have to take that chance.
I never agreed to experiment on people.
you brought them Molly, didn't you?
I didn't know what else to do.
all right, look.
if you refuse to do this, they're gonna get rid of you, and then we're gonna lose everything that we've been trying to do.
and worse yet, you're gonna lose Molly.
now you've got principles, and that's fine.
but to bring down this company, sometimes we have to do bad things.
don't disappoint me, Suresh.
kolya? We'll be late for the party.
so handsome.
here.
let grandma...
what time will you be home?
three o'clock.
unless there's candy.
then I make no promises.
my old friend.
we need to talk.
something wrong?
I lied to my dad.
the other night when I went home, I told him I'd joined cheerleading.
cheerleading?
that is bad.
you don't understand.
cheerleading tryouts were last period.
I didn't make it.
what am I supposed to tell him?
you met this awesome guy, and you need some free time to make out.
I told you my dad's really overprotective about the whole dating thing.
he told me I couldn't date until I was 21.
so?
so I have to listen to my parents. Don't you?
Claire, I can fly.
it kind of makes the whole parental guidance thing a non-issue.
but if it's that important to you, we'll figure out a way to get you on the team.
it's impossible.
Debbie Marshall does not deem me extraordinary enough.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
you're a total babe, and you have a power.
by definition, you're better than she is.
Oh, you're sweet.
but it's not just her.
she's got that whole squad wrapped around her evil little pinky.
I knew girls just like her at my old school.
all would take is one person to stand up to her.
well, be that person.
take her down a notch.
how?
you were a cheerleader.
what do they fear most?
public humiliation?
we could give her a taste of her own medicine.
your ability is fascinating.
a gift.
what I do is terrible.
I have taken many lives, and I can't control it.
I was like you.
I could do things, amazing things.
you?
like what?
I could move objects with my mind.
I could hear a pin drop from miles away.
but then it all just.
went away.
that's why I need to see Dr. Suresh, to get them back.
you want to be different?
I want to be special, unique.
an ability doesn't have to be a burden, Maya.
it can be wonderful.
stop at the next gas station I need to find a coyote to take us across what?
what about Gabriel?
I don't trust him, Maya I see the way he looks at you why is he still there?
is there a problem?
my brother wants to hire a coyote, to cross the border without you.
Why?
you can't trust them.
God delivered Gabriel to us, Aleiandro we should put your faith in him.
it's okay.
we'll cross the border together.
I'm glad to have found you, Gabriel.
you started without me?
sorry. It's just so compelling.
Hiro and Kensei made it to White Beard's camp. See?
stop!
you can't skip ahead!
I must know every detail.
start where we left off!
okay.
okay.
tonight, we will attack...
...three fo us against an army.
but even with powers, I fear for the swordsmith's life.
and for Yaeko...
the woman I love, but cannot have you should reconsider.
rescuing your father will be dangerous.
so long as Kensei fights at my side, I fear nothing.
but I'm concerned. How will we find my father among all these tents?
the story.
Kensei trailed smoke to flame and found White Beard's treasure.
there the tent that smolders.
the tent that smolders?
this is no time for lucky guesses.
my father's life is at stake.
you're right.
I am sorry.
tell me, Hiro why are you still here?
why do you risk your life for my father?
it's gonna be some fight!
did you find my father?
Yes, my love. In the tent that smolders.
you were right, Yaeko.
we have nothing to fear with Kensei around!
come on painted a series of eight paintings beginning with Kaito Nakamura's death and ending in mine.
where are they?
sorry, I'm retired.
I work in the textile factory now.
regional manager of sales, like you in the paper company.
cut the crap.
where are the paintings?
you think you intimidate me?
I trained you, you and your invisible partner Claude.
I taught you everything!
then you know what I'm capable of.
don't make me do this.
what is this?
you want information?
the haitian can't help you.
my friend has a new trick.
he can reach inside that company-loving head of yours and one by one, blot out all the memories you hold most dear.
think about it, a man of your advanced years.
treasured memories give your life meaning.
your wedding in Capri.
the births of Andre and Mikhail.
it'd be a shame if they disappeared, lost forever.
you...
I am...
you...
start with the day he met his wife.
a boat ride on the Danube, wasn't it?
a tell me about Katarina.
your honeymoon.
her favorite flower.
I can't remember.
Really?
after 35 years together, such a shame.
are you ready to talk, or do we keep going?
go.
Hi, honey.
is everything all right?
Hey, dad, yeah.
I was just wondering if I could borrow the car tonight.
did you ask your mother?
I did, and she said to ask you.
I'm gonna be with the cheerleaders later.
just thought you should know.
full disclosure and all.
well, that's very responsible of you, Claire.
take the car.
but do one thing for me.
sure.
lock the doors this time.
I will. Thanks.
is there something else?
where are you right now?
I told you.
management training in Tulsa.
and I'm late for a session.
well, I thought you had to work there a year before they'd send you.
I'm a quick learner.
I've gotta go.
I love you, Claire-bear.
I love you too, dad.
what do you think?
okay.
I'm in.
your daughter Claire?
it must be very difficult for her, the constant fear of discovery, especially for a teenager.
aren't you tired of running?
I'm protecting her from animals like you.
you can't hide forever.
take all his memories of me, my family, Claire, everything I ever told him.
he remembers nothing!
wait!
I'm like you.
family comes first.
maybe we can make a deal.
what kind of deal?
you were my protege, so dedicated to the company, you made me proud.
I miss that.
I want you back. - Forget it.
the company has changed.
we have new directives.
come back to us and you'll be safe, all of you.
you have my word.
what about the paintings?
you'll be told everything.
I can give you your life back.
trust me.
what is that?
a border fence, not finished yet.
that is America right there.
Alejandro, we made it!
that's the United States!
attention, you're in violation of U. S.Immigration!
we have notified border patrol.
all right, boys, andale, andale.
let's see them hands.
who are they?
they're locals, not border patrol.
they're fake police. Just drive around them.
God help us.
what's--what's that for?
a cholinergic.
it's standard procedure to see if your ability improves.
uh-uh, no way.
I won't do needles.
it's the last phase of your testing.
one shot, you can go home.
fine.
just make it fast.
I can't do this.
Dr. Suresh?
I won't do it.
if you don't, someone else will.
and there's more where that came from.
stop! What are you doing?
get someone else to do your research.
I'm taking Molly, and I'm leaving.
all right, boys, this is your last warning.
we have to go. - They will shoot us.
we never should have listened to him...
Alejandro, stop!
just drive, now!
it's happening.
give me your hand...
no, no, no, no, no.
let her alone.
what are you doing? You'll die.
we need to get past these men, these guns.
you can use your gift.
Maya! Take my hand. Hurry...
no.
what are you doing?! Maya!
drive.
the next time you think of that second helping of chunky monkey, remember one thing.
the sharpie doesn't lie.
appearance matters, girls.
is this really necessary?
hell, yes.
I might have to basket catch one of these tubettes.
Debbie, can I talk to you for a minute?
private function, butler.
cheerleaders only.
I'll do your biology homework for a week.
you have five minutes.
I want another chance, another shot at tryouts.
I appreciate the effort, really.
attempting to better your social status at school is very American dream of you.
but everyone has their place in this world.
deal with it.
so you're not gonna change your mind?
you are slow, aren't you?
Oh, my god.
she was right there.
her neck was twisted. She was bleeding.
I went to see if I could help her, and that's when he came after me.
the flying masked man? - Yes!
I escaped, thank goodness, but Claire was dead, right there on the steps. I saw her.
she's.
what's going on?
but I saw you. That thing dropped you.
Debbie, calm down. I'm fine.
I don't supposed you saw a.
flying masked man this evening?
me? No. No.
uh, I was just hanging out with Debbie.
find anything, Ray? - No dead bodies.
I did find this.
how much have you had to drink tonight, miss Marshall?
we don't have much time. The sun will rise soon.
Yaeko's father is there.
you take out the guard, we will follow.
you've given me purpose, carp.
I'm really a hero.
and more, you've made me a better man.
you wouldn't happen to have a swordsmith in there, would you?
No...this can't be.
I know. It's really unfair.
that was easy enough.
Yaeko?! I had stopped hoping.
father! We came to save you!
I am Hiro.
and this is the great swordsman Takezo Kensei.
he has come to save you.
Kensei?
I thought you were a drunk.
turns out. I'm a hero.
Kensei! Cut my father's chains.
I cannot leave.
white beard has built an arsenal.
of guns. Thousands.
I must destroy them.
guns are not allowed in Japan.
not yet anyway.
they are here...because of me.
I told White Beard how to make them.
white Beard said.
if I did not help him.
he'd kill you, my daughter.
he plans to overthrow the emperor.
if White Beard uses guns it would end the way of the sword and the samurai.
you must stop them.
destroy all the guns! That is how you save Japan.
very well.
Kensei has a plan. He will smash the guns.
we must go now.
the sun is rising can I speak with you for a moment?
I owe you an apology.
what I asked you to do was wrong.
I've been with the company for 30 years.
we've been through a lot of turmoil and made a lot of difficult choices, some I regret to this day.
but right now I'm dealing with someone who is a real danger to us, to everyone, and I'm afraid that in my haste to deal with him,
I overstepped my bounds.
the file you were holding, Adam Monroe.
Yes.
you're valuable to us, Dr. Suresh, not just for your blood or your knowledge, but to keep us in line.
Molly still isn't well, so I can't take her away from here.
but you've given me no reason to trust you.
I know, I know.
we both have a lot at stake.
I have someone at my disposal, someone who can make sure there's no further misunderstandings.
sound good?
I don't really have a choice, do I?
the Swordsmith escapes.
what happened?
what have you done?
how did we get here, Hiro?
I don't know.
we should find Kensei.
he'll explain everything.
no.
you did it.
you held me.
and then we were here.
you can move people from one plave to another.
You...with a mask.
it was you, Hiro.
all this time.
it was you that did those amazing things.
I only wanted to fix history.
you saved me from the brigands.
you were the one under the cherry blossoms.
do you...
love me, Hiro?
I do.
very much.
everything I loves in Kensei came from you.
but the spave/time continuum...
it was the kiss that fractured time.
it changed me forever, Ando.
Where's the rest of it?
that's it, the end.
the last scroll.
there has to be more!
my friend is not back yet.
please.
sorry.
stop.
I did what I had to do. For all of us.
listen to what you're saying.
you're a killer, because of him.
I won't do this.
you have to choose.
either he goes...
or I do.
don't Alejandro.
we need Gabriel.
he can take us to Dr. Suresh.
to salvation.
fine, he can stay.
but the next time your eyes blacken.
don't look for my hand.
it won't be there.
I will let him die.
I will get something for your lip.
I know you don't understand me.
but I want to tell you why I'm helping you.
it's that delicious power.
you see, when I get my ability back, I'm gonna kill you.
and your sister.
and I'm gonna take it all.
and if I don't get my ability back, it's not a total loss.
Maya's learning quickly.
she's a shiny new toy, and she's all mine.
I can't believe you talked me into that.
what?
somebody could have seen us.
relax. No one saw.
and no one will ever believe Debbie.
did you see her face?
classic.
is she gonna be okay?
definitely.
she freaked, but just think of it as a lesson in humility.
hope I'm not interrupting. - No, it's okay. How's Debbie?
she blew a 13.
drinking on school grounds.
got suspended from the cheerleading squad immediately.
which means we have an opening.
first practice is Monday after school.
you mean it? I'm on the team? - Sure.
you were the best at try-outs.
I'll just let you two get back to.
whatever. I'll see you Monday.
tell me something, Ivan.
in all the years I've known you, why have you never mentioned a daughter?
this daughter.
she died, didn't she?
leukemia. - I'm so sorry.
that must have been so painful.
I can't even imagine losing Claire.
to think.
all you have left of her are your memories.
it would be awful if they were taken.
almost as if she never existed.
please don't. - Take the daughter. Don't leave anything.
wait!
it's in the warehouse near the train yard.
where we tagged the liquid man.
you'll find your paintings there.
thank you.
now what?
your haitian friend makes sure that'll I'll forget that you were ever here?
I wish it were that easy.
once the company discovers your memory loss, they're gonna trace it back to the haitian, which leads to my family.
and I can't have it. - What are you doing?
you taught me well, my friend.
you said,"make it look as if you were never there."
so now we weren't.
instead, there was a simple home invasion, - a senseless murder. - I am offering you a way out.
you can stop running!
shoot me and there is no turning back.
you'll condemn yourself to hell.
I know.
Kensei, I've been searching for hours.
come, my friend.
we must go back and destroy whitebeard's guns.
if you want to stop him, do it yourself.
something wrong?
I saw you, Hiro.
after I saved the swordsmith, I came after you, afraid something had happened to Yaeko, because I love her.
and you, friend, betrayed me. - No.
Yes. You kissed her.
it happened.
by accident. - You accidentally kissed her?
I accidentally fell in love with her, and she with me.
I'm so sorry.
so you've been lying to me all along.
first you show me that I can be harmed by no weapon, and then you cut me deeper than any blade possibly could.
she's your princess, Kensei.
I know that.
and I swear I will not give in to love.
that kiss will be our last.
but the fate of the world still rests in our hands.
we must stop whitebeard.
all right, carp.
let's go.
nicely done, for this Takezo Kensei.
whatever you desire shall be yours.
you're covered at work and at home, an impromptu burger bonanza training seminar at corporate.
here.
what's this? - Information. Phone numbers.
if you have any questions or concerns,
I want you to call us anytime, day or night.
also, here.
it's fully loaded.
anything from martial arts to plumbing, any skill you want is now at your fingertips.
Wow.
support, advice, and now gifts.
you're like my own personal Oprah.
you have an amazing gift.
so look around.
seems to me like this town could use a little amazing.
Thanks.
right.
Hello, Dr. Suresh.
Niki? How are you?
I'm feeling better now.
back to my old self, thanks to the company.
in fact, I'm gonna be working with them for a while.
so you're - your new partner.
I know.
it's the last place that I expected to be, but.
I owe these people so much.
Bob told me that you two were having some trust issues.
he just wants me to make sure that there's no more misunderstandings.
that's okay, isn't it?
warehouse Odessa, Ukraine
what does it mean?
montreal, Canada - Are you ready? - Yeah.
what is this place?
I don't know.
someone knew I was coming.
we were right about the company.
the world is in danger. It's up to us. Adam.
the name Adam doesn't ring a bell?
no, and I don't know about any company.
I don't know about any of this.
the world is in danger.
what am I supposed to do?
we'll figure it out.
please tell me who I am, what the future holds.
Peter, how did we？
I don't know.
we're in New York.
where is everyone?
it's an evacuation order.
june 14, 2008.
this is next year.
plane ticket, painting...
it all points to Montreal.
what is this place?
we were right about the company.
the world is in danger. Adam.
please tell me who I am.
what the future holds.
we'll figure it out.
we're in New York.
where is everyone?
it's an evacuation order.
june 14, 2008.
this is next year.
this thing we could do, it only begins at reading minds.
and then it becomes so much more.
my dad can put a thought into anyone's head.
now we know why molly calls him the nightmare man.
it's Bob.
he runs the company.
looks like he's next.
you sure you're gonna be able to cure me?
in exchange, we're going to want a little something from you.
Hello, Dr. Suresh.
so you're... -your new partner.
Oh, my god!
did you see her face?
somebody could have seen us!
relax!
just think of it as a lesson in humility.
what's on your neck?
last thing I remember, this man stepping out of the bushes, calling my name.
what are you talking about? What man?
the guy with the horn-rimmed glasses.
wait, it's the warehouse near the train yard.
you will find your paintings there.
I saw you, Hiro.
and you, friend, betrayed me.
Hiro White Beard's camp, Japan-1671.
you can't stop time with your nose stuck in a dollop of opium.
please. Let him go.
I'm sorry, "my love."
I can't do that.
why are you doing this?
white Beard offered me anything I wanted to capture Hiro.
I asked for half the country.
and for you.
as my Princess.
you will never have me.
I love Hiro.
you hear that, Carp?
she thinks she loves you.
poor, pitiful you.
you are supposed to be a hero.
after I lead white beard's army to victory,
I will be the greatest leader japan has ever known.
I will change history.
Noah Bennet Oessa, UKRAINE.
Moginder & Molly Hartsdale, NY.
hello.
have they given you a gun?
what are you talking about?
a gun.
company issue.
where have you been? I need to talk to you.
I found the paintings.
the series that leads up to my death.
where? How? -Ukraine.
an old friend helped me find them.
and I'm looking at one of you holding a company gun.
I don't have a gun.
these paintings are all random.
I need you to help me make sense of them.
I'm gonna forward them to you right now.
don't, that's what I've been trying to say.
they've given me a partner.
that's just standard protocol.
it isn't. She's here to watch every move I make.
they don't trust me.
my family is in danger.
so that makes me expendable?
we were supposed to take the company down together, but you...
I don't know what your agenda is anymore.
Dr. Suresh.
I have to go.
Bob needs to see us.
I get it. You don't want a partner.
but that's not my call.
so you admit it. You're a guard dog.
Where's everyone going?
I'm evacuating the facility.
Why?
I'll let them explain it to you.
officer Parkman. Mr. Petrelli.
I thought you were gonna find your father.
I did.
he attacked Angela Petrelli.
my father killed Kaito Nakamura.
he's killing them all.
and now he's coming to kill bob.
Hello!
Hello! Hello!
Peter & Caitlin NY, 2008.
there's no one here, Peter.
they've all gone.
evacuated by homeland security.
Peter, what did you do?
me? I didn't do anything.
are you sure?
we were in Montreal.
I picked up a note from some guy named Adam who says the world is in danger.
next thing you know, we're here.
one year in the future.
I mean, how is that even possible?
over there.
get on the ground!
get on the ground now!
do you have any symptoms?
are you sick?
sick? What the hell is going on?
take them to decontamination now!
from West: G morning. Did U have breakfast yet?
just woke up.
from West: What R U having? Smells like waffles.
chapter Seven "OUT OF TIME"
mom, did you make waffles?
Nope. West did.
I wanted to bring you breakfast.
I hope you don't mind.
why would she mind?
uh, because he wasn't invited, and some people think that's rude?
nonsense.
your dad and I love meeting your friends.
will Mr. Butler be joining us?
sadly, no.
his business trip was extended.
something about...
something I wasn't paying any attention to.
Lyle, get your butt out of bed!
he's adorable.
why would you come here when I told you not to?
I had to show you something.
check it out.
we're infamous.
drunk cheerleader suspended. Claims that she saw a boy fly.
what are we gonna do?
people are gonna know it was us.
how? It's a blurb.
on the last page of the local flavor section.
it's no big. - It is big.
you can't just do whatever you want whenever you want.
I just wanna be a part of your life.
okay.
but just for waffles.
how do you know your father's coming to kill b?
isn't this all a bit reactionary?
no. Matt's right.
security just found his car ditched off the road Maury could be here right now.
I'm taking you into protective custody.
my first priority's to keep you safe.
you can't.
you couldn't keep Angela Petrelli safe.
she almost killed herself on your watch.
no, we stop Maury here now.
you realize that makes you the bait.
we all have our roles to play.
that's what Linderman used to say.
my mother too.
it's always these half-truths.
no straight answers. Constant manipulation.
I'm trying to help everyone here.
how, Bob?
what the hell did you people do?
why is Maury coming here to kill you?
now is not the time to recount the past.
but to focus on the task at hand.
all right! Fine, so we stay here.
how do we stop my father?
Dr. Suresh,
I need you and Niki to inject Maury with the virus.
virus?
what virus?
the virus takes away abilities.
it's also potentially lethal.
you said we'd never use it again. - Circumstances have changed.
I will not knowingly spread this virus.
Maury is a killer.
he knows your thoughts, your nightmares, and he could turn your world inside out.
we take away his abilities, and then you can cure him with the antibodies in your blood.
no one dies here today.
he's not gonna exactly volunteer for a shot.
I can be persuasive.
I appreciate the thought.
but this one goes to you, Matt.
what? Me?
all I can do is read minds. -No, no, no.
you have the same abilities as Maury has.
anything the brain controls, - you control. N-No.
senses, actions, thoughts -- no!
no, I can't.
I- I - I can't do any of that stuff.
well, then you better learn fast because you're the only one who could stop your father.
I should never have forged those guns.
white Beard will conquer Japan.
it is all my fault.
we are not finished yet.
they always underestimate women.
their folly.
I am a sword-smith's daughter...
HIRO...HIRO...
you must concentrate!
you have to get us out of here.
why is everything so purple?
get back to your post.
white Beard doesn't tolerate laziness.
Please...Please.
Please...Please.
according to these files, -you're a dead man. - What?
I got your death certificate right here.
so...
you're gonna have to explain to me, how's a dead man walk around New York city - with no sign of infection? -Infection?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where's Caitlin? I need to see her.
she's from Ireland. All foreigners are deported.
you can't do that!
who the hell are you people?
what's going on here?
you really don't know.
on March 20th, 2007 the first case was reported.
after that the shanti virus spread across the globe.
a pandemic.
it's killed 93% of the world's population to date.
the rest of us live in quarantine praying to find a cure.
this can't be happening.
I wish it wasn't.
all these people died from the virus?
Yeah, it's been a tough week.
I'm supposed to be out hunting down Maury, but I needed to see you.
I never should have asked you to use your...ability to find my dad.
you were just tryin'to make me happy.
I know that feeling.
when my dad left I...
I blamed myself. I thought that I was...too slow...too...fat.
too stupid.
I thought that if I was...better, or if I was smarter, he would stayed.
and now they want me...
they think that I can stop him, that I've got this power.
and I don't.
I don't.
I need you to hear.
I need you to know that I love you.
did you just hear me?
I love you, Molly.
what's left of the virus is in the lab.
each syringe contains only one dose, so use it wisely.
you don't trust bob, do you?
did he put you up to this?
I put me up to this.
I wanna hear your side.
Bob is morally gray at best.
and the virus?
he's toying with a death sentence.
you have the cure.
no one dies.
just because he's a safety net doesn't make it ethical.
so you would make a different choice?
morally un-gray?
I killed a lot of people...brutally ripped them in half.
they could have given me the virus, but they didn't.
they've made me right, so that I could have a life.
go home to my son.
you're never gonna have a life.
you're not cured.
you're a killer.
and before this day is over you're gonna kill everyone.
go on.
tell him what you're seeing.
he'll think you've gone crazy again.
and then you'll never see Micah.
is everything all right?
let's go.
I know these other families.
everyone who's been killed.
but I don't know this one.
who is he?
who's Adam Monroe?
Adam is...complicated.
so un-complicate it.
Adam convinced us that we belonged together.
that we could make the world a better place for our children for you.
snow falls on Miami.
I don't get it.
that headline could have read "tsunami wipes out eastern seaboard."
what does any of this have to do with the murders?
Adam is the one who's trying to kill us.
I thought Maury Parkman was -- Maury's the weapon.
he's the blunt instrument.
Adam was the visionary.
but with these abilities, sometimes people tend to think of themselves as gods.
did you ever think that, Nathan?
Adam did.
and he began to talk about holocausts, plagues.
punishing humanity in order to save the world.
sounds a lot like Linderman.
Linderman was Adam's disciple.
Adam was dangerous.
so we locked him up.
we threw away the key.
two weeks ago he escapes.
and now he wants revenge.
it sounds like you're reaping what you sow.
why should I care?
because of Peter.
listen, pal, you wanna talk about my brother, you better be very careful what you say next.
Peter is alive, Nathan.
your brother is alive.
I'll leave you two alone.
do I know you?
they brought me here to help you, Peter.
you need to remember who you are.
I need to find Caitlin.
you need to focus.
you can move objects with your mind, heal, you can paint the future.
how do you know about that?
you absorb abilities from other people.
you are the most powerful of us all.
you're a kind and caring soul.
selfless. Always thinking about others.
but now you need to think about yourself and fly into the face of danger.
just like your brother.
I have a brother.
he died in the first outbreak.
but you -- you can change that.
how?
I was in Montreal in 2007.
the next thing I know, I'm here.
you met a man named Hiro Nakamura.
he can travel in time.
so can you.
you can change history.
I can't. - You must!
I can't control these things that are happening to me!
then this virus will kill us all.
Peter, you need to remember.
you need to remember.
mom?
do the marks hurt?
no.
they're kind a just there.
painless souvenirs of my alien abduction from the guy with horn-rimmed glasses.
if you're gonna be dropping in, there's something I need to tell you.
I get it.
get what?
I'm moving too fast.
we don't have to go any further if you don't want to.
you know what I want?
popsicles.
popsicles.
awesome.
raspberry or blue?
he found us.
who?
the man who abducted me. We've gotta get outta here.
come on.
no, wait. That's what I've been trying to tell you.
the guy in the glasses is my father.
what is this?
some sort of trap?
no, just listen to me.
back off.
wait.
who are you talkin' to?
no one.
you've got two popsicles.
welcome home.
there is nothing you can do now.
we lost. White Beard has won.
we must go on while we still can.
I can not.
white Beard's army is preparing to march.
but how? Even with your ability, what can you do against an army...?
destroy their guns.
without them White Beard is nothing.
and what about Kensei? You cannot stop him.
nothing can.
his heart is broken.
pain has made him cruel. But, he is good inside.
you would risk your life for your faith in him?
it won't be safe for you here.
meet me under the cherry blossoms.
wait for me.
all this trouble over one drop of liquid.
this virus could kill an entire species.
or it could stop Maury and save our lives.
poor Niki.
so vulnerable.
you're perfect. Show me your nightmares.
show me your thoughts. Show me your soul.
how do I turn you into a killer?
nothing's going to save you.
this company is bad.
you're not making up for your son' s.
you're diggin' deeper into hell, and worse, you're gonna drag Micah right down with you.
you're wrong.
they said that they would help me.
Niki, what are you talkin' about?
I was sick.
I'm still sick.
how can you say that?
because you're dead.
no, I'm not.
they don't want me talkin' to you.
they're using you, Nik.
just like Linderman. Just like Jessica.
you can still do the right thing.
you have to kill him.
that's the only way you can save Micah.
Niki, you're talking to yourself.
I think it's Maury.
we need to call Bob.
I thought you'd come here.
this many guns in Japan, they will crush history.
I cannot let White Beard win.
we can still stop this...together.
we did make a good team, you and I.
you showed me how to be a hero.
how to love.
and then...
you took it all away.
do it, Hiro.
stop time. Kill me.
cut off my head.
I will not do it.
I still have faith in you.
the honorable Hiro Nakamura.
he won't kill you.
he'll just lie, cheat, and steal.
I wanted to help you become a hero.
I never claimed to be anything more than a happy drunk.
do not punish the world for my mistakes!
I only want to punish you, Hiro.
Yaeko was right.
she's not destined to be my princess.
she's destined to die.
No!
take my hand.
we must get out of here now.
Never!
as long as I have breath, anything you love, I will lay to waste.
I swear.
you will suffer.
Peter's alive, Nathan.
this was taken three months ago right here.
is he here now?
no. He's gone.
gone where?
what is it you're not telling me?
I need to know everything.
he was in Cork, Ireland, and then we lost track of him.
lost track of him?
how do you lose someone?
how do you lose someone?
dad!
what are you doing in here?
where are we?
this is where he keeps me.
what?
when I tried to find your dad, he locked me in here.
now we're both trapped.
no.
no, we're not.
dad!
did you bring me here?
I think...
I think I did.
step back, Nathan. I got it.
don't do it, Niki. This isn't you.
don't do it. - How can you defend him? He killed D. L.
I didn't kill anyone. It's Maury.
he's gotten inside of your head.
listen to me, this is a nightmare. This isn't you.
don't be his puppet! You're stronger than this.
you came here to get control of your life.
don't let Maury undo all of that.
listen to me. Listen to me.
think of your son. Think of Micah.
think of your boy.
I couldn't get the nightmare out.
I didn't know what else to do.
I had to stop myself.
don't be scared, Molly. We're gonna get out of here.
do you recognize this room?
Yeah, of course. This is our old place on Parthenia.
brisket and potatoes. This is the night you left.
I never apologized.
you weren't sorry. You walked out that door, you never even turned back.
you think this didn't hurt me?
this broke my heart.
I love you, Matt.
then turn yourself in.
that's not gonna happen.
there's no prison that can hold me. - I think there is!
I think I can trap you in here just like you trapped Molly.
how are you gonna do that? - Look around, pop.
this isn't my nightmare! This is yours!
I can walk right out that door. - No, you can't.
I have to. Come on.
you can't!
because you're not strong enough!
because you're still that scared little boy!
No! I'm not scared of you anymore!
I'm a good man! I'm a good cop!
I'm a good father, which is something you know nothing about.
you don't know what it's like to fight for someone that you love.
you left.
you left.
all you have are your nightmares.
let's get out of here.
don't leave me.
don't leave me alone! No!
Oh, god.
Molly, the nightmare's over.
he's never gonna hurt you again.
ever. I promise.
Oh, god, I love you.
I heard.
so what happens next?
where do all these people go?
same place we are, home.
I'm so scared!
please don't let them take me away from you. - I'll get us home. I promise.
please, peter. Don't let them take me.
no. No! No!
the army has scattered.
white Beard is defeated.
you have saved us all.
at what price?
he was my friend.
I betrayed him.
I killed Takezo Kensei.
everything Kensei accomplished...
you did all these things. Not him.
as sure as I live, you are Takezo Kensei.
perhaps now you can live happily with his Princess.
there's not how the story ends.
it is the last trial. "Kensei and the Dragon."
my father told it to me.
the dragon who taught Kensei the way of the sword...Demanded his love in return.
what did Kensei do?
he cut out his own heart to save her.
to save Japan.
is that what you must do now?
cut out your heart?
I nearly destroyed time by staying when I should have left.
I must go back.
as long as I have a voice, all shall know the story of noble Takezo Kensei.
the boy Hiro Nakamura will have tales to help him sleep.
and he will dream of the Princess.
farewell.
the antibodies in my blood will eradicate any traces of the virus in your system.
your nose,
does it hurt?
only when I breathe.
I'm sorry.
it's not your fault.
you weren't in control.
this can't be right.
what's wrong?
the antibodies aren't working. This isn't possible. Not now.
it's another strain of the virus.
it's immune. My blood's no longer a cure.
I'm going to die?
I had to get you a souvenir.
Hiro!
you're alive! You're a samurai!
I was scared you'd never come back.
has it been long?
months! I haven't seen you since we saved the world.
then we did?
no bomb?
no boom?
we saved the world!
there is so much to catch up on.
where is my father?
I well to tell you both everything.
Hiro...your father...
he's dead.
murdered.
this strain has no cure.
are you certain of these results?
we'll keep Maury sedated. We'll destroy every last vial.
I promise.
what is this?
it's a chance to save Niki.
we got a police report.
a girl walks away from a 50-foot fall without a scratch.
cellular regeneration?
her name is Claire Bennet.
you remember her father, Noah?
he worked for us.
of course. He's not exactly gonna let us take his daughter, is he?
are you saying we should kill him?
I'm saying we should be prepared.
this is Ivan Spector.
our man in the Ukraine. He was Bennet's friend, his mentor.
Bennet killed him.
when was this? - Last night.
are you sure it was him?
he left fingerprints.
Bennet is getting sloppy, emotional...
and that means dangerous.
I have something I need to tell you.
I have been working with Bennet to take down this company.
why are you telling me this now?
because...
I am unsure of who's right and who's wrong.
and it is time to stop playing games.
there's a storm coming, Dr. Suresh.
Claire is the key.
her regenerative abilities, they could cure the virus.
she could save Niki.
I want to do the right thing here.
for Niki.
for everyone.
so did you meet him?
meet who?
the boyfriend, West. He was here today.
Claire has a boyfriend?
I checked him out, he's fine.
you cannot be the only man in her life forever.
no, I suppose not.
we knew this day would come.
west, please answer me you wanna tell me about this?
it's nothing. - Nothing.
the cheerleader claims she saw her teammate fall 50 feet to her death.
that's nothing.
I asked you to do one thing, Claire.
I asked you to keep your nose clean.
Debbie was drunk. Nobody believes her.
did your boyfriend make you do this?
are you kidding me? - Answer me.
it's none of your business!
your tiny rebellions are putting this family in danger!
me?
what about you, dad?
you think any of us really believe that you were out at a copy conference?
where were you, out abducting people?
what is going on down here?
what did Claire do this time? - Shut up, Lyle!
it's not safe here anymore.
pack your bags. We're moving.
you can't do that.
this is not a discussion.
we're leaving.
then you're going without me.
Adam. I don't know any Adam.
Peter, what the hell was that?
do you know me?
of course I know you.
it's me, Adam.
don't you remember?
you and I are going to change history.
plane ticket, painting...
it all points to Montreal.
what is this place?
we were right about the company.
the world is in danger. Adam.
please tell me who I am.
what the future holds.
we'll figure it out.
we're in New York.
where is everyone?
it's an evacuation order.
june 14, 2008.
this is next year.
this thing we could do, it only begins at reading minds.
and then it becomes so much more.
my dad can put a thought into anyone's head.
now we know why molly calls him the nightmare man.
it's Bob.
he runs the company.
looks like he's next.
you sure you're gonna be able to cure me?
in exchange, we're going to want a little something from you.
Hello, Dr. Suresh.
so you're... -your new partner.
Oh, my god!
did you see her face?
somebody could have seen us!
relax!
just think of it as a lesson in humility.
what's on your neck?
last thing I remember, this man stepping out of the bushes, calling my name.
what are you talking about? What man?
the guy with the horn-rimmed glasses.
wait, it's the warehouse near the train yard.
you will find your paintings there.
I saw you, Hiro.
and you, friend, betrayed me.
Hiro White Beard's camp, Japan-1671.
you can't stop time with your nose stuck in a dollop of opium.
please. Let him go.
I'm sorry, "my love."
I can't do that.
why are you doing this?
white Beard offered me anything I wanted to capture Hiro.
I asked for half the country.
and for you.
as my Princess.
you will never have me.
I love Hiro.
you hear that, Carp?
she thinks she loves you.
poor, pitiful you.
you are supposed to be a hero.
after I lead white beard's army to victory,
I will be the greatest leader japan has ever known.
I will change history.
Noah Bennet Oessa, UKRAINE.
Moginder & Molly Hartsdale, NY.
hello.
have they given you a gun?
what are you talking about?
a gun.
company issue.
where have you been? I need to talk to you.
I found the paintings.
the series that leads up to my death.
where? How? -Ukraine.
an old friend helped me find them.
and I'm looking at one of you holding a company gun.
I don't have a gun.
these paintings are all random.
I need you to help me make sense of them.
I'm gonna forward them to you right now.
don't, that's what I've been trying to say.
they've given me a partner.
that's just standard protocol.
it isn't. She's here to watch every move I make.
they don't trust me.
my family is in danger.
so that makes me expendable?
we were supposed to take the company down together, but you...
I don't know what your agenda is anymore.
Dr. Suresh.
I have to go.
Bob needs to see us.
I get it. You don't want a partner.
but that's not my call.
so you admit it. You're a guard dog.
Where's everyone going?
I'm evacuating the facility.
Why?
I'll let them explain it to you.
officer Parkman. Mr. Petrelli.
I thought you were gonna find your father.
I did.
he attacked Angela Petrelli.
my father killed Kaito Nakamura.
he's killing them all.
and now he's coming to kill bob.
Hello!
Hello! Hello!
Peter & Caitlin NY, 2008.
there's no one here, Peter.
they've all gone.
evacuated by homeland security.
Peter, what did you do?
me? I didn't do anything.
are you sure?
we were in Montreal.
I picked up a note from some guy named Adam who says the world is in danger.
next thing you know, we're here.
one year in the future.
I mean, how is that even possible?
over there.
get on the ground!
get on the ground now!
do you have any symptoms?
are you sick?
sick? What the hell is going on?
take them to decontamination now!
from West: G morning. Did U have breakfast yet?
just woke up.
from West: What R U having? Smells like waffles.
chapter Seven "OUT OF TIME"
mom, did you make waffles?
Nope. West did.
I wanted to bring you breakfast.
I hope you don't mind.
why would she mind?
uh, because he wasn't invited, and some people think that's rude?
nonsense.
your dad and I love meeting your friends.
will Mr. Butler be joining us?
sadly, no.
his business trip was extended.
something about...
something I wasn't paying any attention to.
Lyle, get your butt out of bed!
he's adorable.
why would you come here when I told you not to?
I had to show you something.
check it out.
we're infamous.
drunk cheerleader suspended. Claims that she saw a boy fly.
what are we gonna do?
people are gonna know it was us.
how? It's a blurb.
on the last page of the local flavor section.
it's no big. - It is big.
you can't just do whatever you want whenever you want.
I just wanna be a part of your life.
okay.
but just for waffles.
how do you know your father's coming to kill b?
isn't this all a bit reactionary?
no. Matt's right.
security just found his car ditched off the road Maury could be here right now.
I'm taking you into protective custody.
my first priority's to keep you safe.
you can't.
you couldn't keep Angela Petrelli safe.
she almost killed herself on your watch.
no, we stop Maury here now.
you realize that makes you the bait.
we all have our roles to play.
that's what Linderman used to say.
my mother too.
it's always these half-truths.
no straight answers. Constant manipulation.
I'm trying to help everyone here.
how, Bob?
what the hell did you people do?
why is Maury coming here to kill you?
now is not the time to recount the past.
but to focus on the task at hand.
all right! Fine, so we stay here.
how do we stop my father?
Dr. Suresh,
I need you and Niki to inject Maury with the virus.
virus?
what virus?
the virus takes away abilities.
it's also potentially lethal.
you said we'd never use it again. - Circumstances have changed.
I will not knowingly spread this virus.
Maury is a killer.
he knows your thoughts, your nightmares, and he could turn your world inside out.
we take away his abilities, and then you can cure him with the antibodies in your blood.
no one dies here today.
he's not gonna exactly volunteer for a shot.
I can be persuasive.
I appreciate the thought.
but this one goes to you, Matt.
what? Me?
all I can do is read minds. -No, no, no.
you have the same abilities as Maury has.
anything the brain controls, - you control. N-No.
senses, actions, thoughts -- no!
no, I can't.
I- I - I can't do any of that stuff.
well, then you better learn fast because you're the only one who could stop your father.
I should never have forged those guns.
white Beard will conquer Japan.
it is all my fault.
we are not finished yet.
they always underestimate women.
their folly.
I am a sword-smith's daughter...
HIRO...HIRO...
you must concentrate!
you have to get us out of here.
why is everything so purple?
get back to your post.
white Beard doesn't tolerate laziness.
Please...Please.
Please...Please.
according to these files, -you're a dead man. - What?
I got your death certificate right here.
so...
you're gonna have to explain to me, how's a dead man walk around New York city - with no sign of infection? -Infection?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where's Caitlin? I need to see her.
she's from Ireland. All foreigners are deported.
you can't do that!
who the hell are you people?
what's going on here?
you really don't know.
on March 20th, 2007 the first case was reported.
after that the shanti virus spread across the globe.
a pandemic.
it's killed 93% of the world's population to date.
the rest of us live in quarantine praying to find a cure.
this can't be happening.
I wish it wasn't.
all these people died from the virus?
Yeah, it's been a tough week.
I'm supposed to be out hunting down Maury, but I needed to see you.
I never should have asked you to use your...ability to find my dad.
you were just tryin'to make me happy.
I know that feeling.
when my dad left I...
I blamed myself. I thought that I was...too slow...too...fat.
too stupid.
I thought that if I was...better, or if I was smarter, he would stayed.
and now they want me...
they think that I can stop him, that I've got this power.
and I don't.
I don't.
I need you to hear.
I need you to know that I love you.
did you just hear me?
I love you, Molly.
what's left of the virus is in the lab.
each syringe contains only one dose, so use it wisely.
you don't trust bob, do you?
did he put you up to this?
I put me up to this.
I wanna hear your side.
Bob is morally gray at best.
and the virus?
he's toying with a death sentence.
you have the cure.
no one dies.
just because he's a safety net doesn't make it ethical.
so you would make a different choice?
morally un-gray?
I killed a lot of people...brutally ripped them in half.
they could have given me the virus, but they didn't.
they've made me right, so that I could have a life.
go home to my son.
you're never gonna have a life.
you're not cured.
you're a killer.
and before this day is over you're gonna kill everyone.
go on.
tell him what you're seeing.
he'll think you've gone crazy again.
and then you'll never see Micah.
is everything all right?
let's go.
I know these other families.
everyone who's been killed.
but I don't know this one.
who is he?
who's Adam Monroe?
Adam is...complicated.
so un-complicate it.
Adam convinced us that we belonged together.
that we could make the world a better place for our children for you.
snow falls on Miami.
I don't get it.
that headline could have read "tsunami wipes out eastern seaboard."
what does any of this have to do with the murders?
Adam is the one who's trying to kill us.
I thought Maury Parkman was -- Maury's the weapon.
he's the blunt instrument.
Adam was the visionary.
but with these abilities, sometimes people tend to think of themselves as gods.
did you ever think that, Nathan?
Adam did.
and he began to talk about holocausts, plagues.
punishing humanity in order to save the world.
sounds a lot like Linderman.
Linderman was Adam's disciple.
we threw away the key.
two weeks ago he escapes.
and now he wants revenge.
it sounds like you're reaping what you sow.
why should I care?
because of Peter.
listen, pal, you wanna talk about my brother, you better be very careful what you say next.
Peter is alive, Nathan.
your brother is alive.
I'll leave you two alone.
do I know you?
they brought me here to help you, Peter.
you need to remember who you are.
I need to find Caitlin.
you need to focus.
you can move objects with your mind, heal, you can paint the future.
how do you know about that?
you absorb abilities from other people.
you are the most powerful of us all.
you're a kind and caring soul.
selfless. Always thinking about others.
but now you need to think about yourself and fly into the face of danger.
just like your brother.
I have a brother.
he died in the first outbreak.
but you -- you can change that.
how?
I was in Montreal in 2007.
the next thing I know, I'm here.
you met a man named Hiro Nakamura.
he can travel in time.
so can you.
you can change history.
I can't. - You must!
I can't control these things that are happening to me!
then this virus will kill us all.
Peter, you need to remember.
you need to remember.
mom?
do the marks hurt?
no.
they're kind a just there.
painless souvenirs of my alien abduction from the guy with horn-rimmed glasses.
if you're gonna be dropping in, there's something I need to tell you.
I get it.
get what?
I'm moving too fast.
we don't have to go any further if you don't want to.
you know what I want?
popsicles.
popsicles.
awesome.
raspberry or blue?
he found us.
who?
the man who abducted me. We've gotta get outta here.
come on.
no, wait. That's what I've been trying to tell you.
the guy in the glasses is my father.
what is this?
some sort of trap?
no, just listen to me.
back off.
wait.
who are you talkin' to?
no one.
you've got two popsicles.
welcome home.
there is nothing you can do now.
we lost. White Beard has won.
we must go on while we still can.
I can not.
white Beard's army is preparing to march.
but how? Even with your ability, what can you do against an army...?
destroy their guns.
without them White Beard is nothing.
and what about Kensei? You cannot stop him.
nothing can.
his heart is broken.
pain has made him cruel. But, he is good inside.
you would risk your life for your faith in him?
it won't be safe for you here.
meet me under the cherry blossoms.
wait for me.
all this trouble over one drop of liquid.
this virus could kill an entire species.
or it could stop Maury and save our lives.
poor Niki.
so vulnerable.
you're perfect. Show me your nightmares.
show me your thoughts. Show me your soul.
how do I turn you into a killer?
nothing's going to save you.
this company is bad.
you're not making up for your son' s.
you're diggin' deeper into hell, and worse, you're gonna drag Micah right down with you.
you're wrong.
they said that they would help me.
Niki, what are you talkin' about?
I was sick.
I'm still sick.
how can you say that?
because you're dead.
no, I'm not.
they don't want me talkin' to you.
they're using you, Nik.
just like Linderman. Just like Jessica.
you can still do the right thing.
you have to kill him.
that's the only way you can save Micah.
Niki, you're talking to yourself.
I think it's Maury.
we need to call Bob.
I thought you'd come here.
this many guns in Japan, they will crush history.
I cannot let White Beard win.
we can still stop this...together.
we did make a good team, you and I.
you showed me how to be a hero.
how to love.
and then...
you took it all away.
do it, Hiro.
stop time. Kill me.
cut off my head.
I will not do it.
I still have faith in you.
the honorable Hiro Nakamura.
he won't kill you.
he'll just lie, cheat, and steal.
I wanted to help you become a hero.
I never claimed to be anything more than a happy drunk.
do not punish the world for my mistakes!
I only want to punish you, Hiro.
Yaeko was right.
she's not destined to be my princess.
she's destined to die.
No!
take my hand.
we must get out of here now.
Never!
as long as I have breath, anything you love, I will lay to waste.
I swear.
you will suffer.
Peter's alive, Nathan.
this was taken three months ago right here.
is he here now?
no. He's gone.
gone where?
what is it you're not telling me?
I need to know everything.
he was in Cork, Ireland, and then we lost track of him.
lost track of him?
how do you lose someone?
how do you lose someone?
dad!
what are you doing in here?
where are we?
this is where he keeps me.
what?
when I tried to find your dad, he locked me in here.
now we're both trapped.
no.
no, we're not.
dad!
did you bring me here?
I think...
I think I did.
step back, Nathan. I got it.
don't do it, Niki. This isn't you.
don't do it. - How can you defend him? He killed D. L.
I didn't kill anyone. It's Maury.
he's gotten inside of your head.
listen to me, this is a nightmare. This isn't you.
don't be his puppet! You're stronger than this.
you came here to get control of your life.
don't let Maury undo all of that.
listen to me. Listen to me.
think of your son. Think of Micah.
think of your boy.
I couldn't get the nightmare out.
I didn't know what else to do.
I had to stop myself.
don't be scared, Molly. We're gonna get out of here.
do you recognize this room?
Yeah, of course. This is our old place on Parthenia.
brisket and potatoes. This is the night you left.
I never apologized.
you weren't sorry. You walked out that door, you never even turned back.
you think this didn't hurt me?
this broke my heart.
I love you, Matt.
then turn yourself in.
that's not gonna happen.
there's no prison that can hold me. - I think there is!
I think I can trap you in here just like you trapped Molly.
how are you gonna do that? - Look around, pop.
this isn't my nightmare! This is yours!
I can walk right out that door. - No, you can't.
I have to. Come on.
you can't!
because you're not strong enough!
because you're still that scared little boy!
No! I'm not scared of you anymore!
I'm a good man! I'm a good cop!
I'm a good father, which is something you know nothing about.
you don't know what it's like to fight for someone that you love.
you left.
you left.
all you have are your nightmares.
let's get out of here.
don't leave me.
don't leave me alone! No!
Oh, god.
Molly, the nightmare's over.
he's never gonna hurt you again.
ever. I promise.
Oh, god, I love you.
I heard.
so what happens next?
where do all these people go?
same place we are, home.
I'm so scared!
please don't let them take me away from you. - I'll get us home. I promise.
please, peter. Don't let them take me.
no. No! No!
the army has scattered.
white Beard is defeated.
you have saved us all.
at what price?
he was my friend.
I betrayed him.
I killed Takezo Kensei.
everything Kensei accomplished...
you did all these things. Not him.
as sure as I live, you are Takezo Kensei.
perhaps now you can live happily with his Princess.
there's not how the story ends.
it is the last trial. "Kensei and the Dragon."
my father told it to me.
the dragon who taught Kensei the way of the sword...Demanded his love in return.
what did Kensei do?
he cut out his own heart to save her.
to save Japan.
is that what you must do now?
cut out your heart?
I nearly destroyed time by staying when I should have left.
I must go back.
as long as I have a voice, all shall know the story of noble Takezo Kensei.
the boy Hiro Nakamura will have tales to help him sleep.
and he will dream of the Princess.
farewell.
the antibodies in my blood will eradicate any traces of the virus in your system.
your nose,
does it hurt?
only when I breathe.
I'm sorry.
it's not your fault.
you weren't in control.
this can't be right.
what's wrong?
the antibodies aren't working. This isn't possible. Not now.
it's another strain of the virus.
it's immune. My blood's no longer a cure.
I'm going to die?
I had to get you a souvenir.
Hiro!
you're alive! You're a samurai!
I was scared you'd never come back.
has it been long?
months! I haven't seen you since we saved the world.
then we did?
no bomb?
no boom?
we saved the world!
there is so much to catch up on.
where is my father?
I well to tell you both everything.
Hiro...your father...
he's dead.
murdered.
this strain has no cure.
are you certain of these results?
we'll keep Maury sedated. We'll destroy every last vial.
I promise.
what is this?
it's a chance to save Niki.
we got a police report.
a girl walks away from a 50-foot fall without a scratch.
cellular regeneration?
her name is Claire Bennet.
you remember her father, Noah?
he worked for us.
of course. He's not exactly gonna let us take his daughter, is he?
are you saying we should kill him?
I'm saying we should be prepared.
this is Ivan Spector.
our man in the Ukraine. He was Bennet's friend, his mentor.
Bennet killed him.
when was this? - Last night.
are you sure it was him?
he left fingerprints.
Bennet is getting sloppy, emotional...
and that means dangerous.
I have something I need to tell you.
I have been working with Bennet to take down this company.
why are you telling me this now?
because...
I am unsure of who's right and who's wrong.
and it is time to stop playing games.
there's a storm coming, Dr. Suresh.
Claire is the key.
her regenerative abilities, they could cure the virus.
she could save Niki.
I want to do the right thing here.
for Niki.
for everyone.
so did you meet him?
meet who?
the boyfriend, West. He was here today.
Claire has a boyfriend?
I checked him out, he's fine.
you cannot be the only man in her life forever.
no, I suppose not.
we knew this day would come.
west, please answer me you wanna tell me about this?
it's nothing. - Nothing.
the cheerleader claims she saw her teammate fall 50 feet to her death.
that's nothing.
I asked you to do one thing, Claire.
I asked you to keep your nose clean.
Debbie was drunk. Nobody believes her.
did your boyfriend make you do this?
are you kidding me? - Answer me.
it's none of your business!
your tiny rebellions are putting this family in danger!
me?
what about you, dad?
you think any of us really believe that you were out at a copy conference?
where were you, out abducting people?
what is going on down here?
what did Claire do this time? - Shut up, Lyle!
it's not safe here anymore.
pack your bags. We're moving.
you can't do that.
this is not a discussion.
we're leaving.
then you're going without me.
Adam. I don't know any Adam.
Peter, what the hell was that?
do you know me?
of course I know you.
it's me, Adam.
don't you remember?
you and I are going to change history.
as long as I have breath, anything you love, I will lay to waste.
Jessica wasn't the strong one.
it was you.
Adam was dangeous so we locked him up, we threw away the key.
two weeks ago, he escapes.
and now he wants revenge.
who are you?
what's your name?
I don't know.
I'm from new york.
who's that?
I wish I knew.
someone knew I was coming.
the name am doesn't ring a bell?
no, and I don't know about any company.
please tell me who I am.
what the future holds.
I was in montreal in 2007.
next thing I know, I'm here.
all these people died from the virus.
you can change history. - I can'T.
you must!
don't let them take me!
No!
it is man's ability to remember that sets us apart.
we are the only species concerned with the past.
Peter petrelli montreal
our memories give us voice.
they bear witness to history so that others might learn.
so they might celebrate our triumphs.
and be warned of our failures.
I don't know any adam.
Peter, what the hell was that?
do you know me?
of course I know you.
Peter, it's me, adam.
don't you remember?
together we're going to change history.
sorry, I don'T...
so the haitian's taken liberties with your mind.
Haitian.
that explains why you fell off the face of the earth.
you can get back your memory.
I know how.
how?
healing.
you can do what I can do.
which means the mind has to repair itself.
how do you suggest I go about doing that?
think about what matters most to you.
do you know what that is?
his name is nathan.
you saved the cheerleader...
four months ago so we could save the world.
you gotta let me go, nathan!
you go, I go!
No!
I'll be okay.
you can fly, I can't!
what do you mean?
it's taking everything in me, all my power not to explode!
let me go!
niki&micah roosevelt hospital, manhattan - Nicole sanders? - Here.

the bullet was less than an inch from his aorta.
the surgery was successful.
he's a lucky man.
thank you.
thank you.
Santo domingo, dominican republic you'll come to love her, you know will i?

I killed them all. everyone...

please help!
keep him alive, okay?
do whatever it takes, you understand me?
officer?
officer, can you help us over here, please?
did you have to use the full blast on him?
he can take it.
he's not a toy, elle.
he could be.
where am I?
someplace safe.
my brother...I was in a hospital.
we have the finest doctors in the world working on him.
but his situation is dire.
so who are you?
what am I doing here?
I am an old friend of your parents'.
Yeah, I've seen you before.
and as I said before, you're safe here.
but your brother...
that's a different story.
he almost died.
because of you, peter.
Hey, it's not like it was your idea to go nuclear and take out half of new york city.
Oh, you know about that?
Yes, as long as your abilities are in control of you, you will always be a hazard to yourself, to your family...
the whole world.
believe me, if I could turn them off, I would.
don't worry, we've done that for you.
at least for now.
how did you...
my colleague here is able to suppress the abilities in people around him.
I don't understand.
what is this place?
you are in a facility designed to help people just like you.
Peter, we can help you go back to a normal life.
30 years ago, we had to shut down research on a vaccine which could disable your powers.
but due to recent events, we have reinstated that research.
and I'm very happy to say that we're very close to finding a cure for you.
forever?
you will never have to worry about hurting anyone you love again.
how long until it's ready?
good!
you're making the right choice.
good boy.
you have hada terrible accident.
he's missing.
he's missing, nathan.
the coast guard is searching 100 square miles of the ocean.
but you're lucky to be alive.
no. Oh, no no no.
dad!
Oh, big guy.
I thought I lost you.
girl, I told you.
you're never getting rid of me.
Mrs. Sanders...
I'll be right back, okay?
I'll be here.
Dr. Brooks.
um, I wanted you to know that we don't have insurance.
but I'm surethat we can come up...
you don't have to worry about that.
it's all been taken care of.
I don't understand.
how? Who paid?
uh, that'd be me.
do I know you?
call me bob.
did you happen to see a morning newspaper?
what?
no, why?
not a mention of what happened last night on kirby plaza.
or the untimely deathof our friend mr. Linderman.
who the hell are you?
someone who wants to help.
Linderman made a mess of things and I'm here to right the ship.
so to speak.
okay.
you've done that by paying our bills.
no, I meant helping you with your illness.
I know you think jessica is gone.
how do you know about that?
but we've discovered that when these abilities manifest, the way the mind deals with the new reality sometimes results in a fracture of sorts.
a split personality.
no, I'm finished with jessica.
how do you know a new personality won't emerge?
I can get you all the help you need.
the best care in the world.
what's the catch?
the catch is you have to leave your family and enter the program.
I just went through hell to get my family back together.
I'm not leaving them now.
there is medication you can try at home, but...
but what?
it's not without side effects.
and as you just said, you've been through so much for your family.
do you really wanna risk...
losing them all again?
so I just take these pills every day?
Yep.
it's a little cocktail they cooked up here in the lab.
it controls the abilities.
dampens them.
like that guy who was standing in the corner of bob's office.
the haitian. Yeah.
Sorta.
so let's just call them...haitian pills.
Bye, peter.
that hurts.
you'll get used to it.
and then you'll start to like it.
Hello?
who said that?
me.
3 months ago.
it's micah's birthday today all right! 11 years old.
almost the man of the house now.
mom?
did you make a wish, baby?
don't tell us.'Cause you know it's not gonna come true.
you both already know what I wished for, anyways.
Micah, we've been over this.
but I've got it all figured out.
I could make the car radio pick up the police band.
we could go to the crime scene and be heroes.
or the police could just take care of it.
we could be like the fantastic four.
minus one. But still.
Micah, I wanna be a hero to you.
and I finally figured out how to do that.
I think I got a job.
a good job.
doing what?
something that's gonna make you proud of me, I promise.
come on. I promised I'd take you bowling, right?
let's go.
mom, you coming?
your mom's had a long day, micah.
go get your jacket.
all I want is to smile at my boy on his birthday, and I can't even do that.
they said it's just gonna take a little while for the medication to level out.
I just don't know how much longer I can do this.
I wanna say things'll get better.
but I know how that sounds.
the truth is, they will.
you know, it's been a month.
you still haven't told me your name.
please, I just wanna be left alone.
you came to the right place.
I have to warn you, though, it does get a bit old.
let me guess.
you were living a perfectly ordinary life.
until one day you discovered you could do incredible things.
I bet it was wonderful at first.
you thought perhaps you could save the world.
and then you realized, tragically, that you were dangerous.
I'll let you talk to me after a decade.
Oh, actually, talk to me after three.
if they wanna leave me in here forever, that's fine by me.
you've been through something awful, haven't you?
I'm sorry.
I'm peter.
Hello, peter.
it's nice to meet you.
I'm adam.
2 months ago.
I'm not in the mood today, elle.
just a little one?
I'll up your dose.
I'm fine.
just a little one.
not that a fistful of pills everyday isn't fun, but...
it's been two months now and I still don't know a thing about you.
I was just thinking...
maybe there's more to you than the whole sadistic lightning thing, that's all.
what's your story?
I liked you better when you just laid there.
so you're not gonna tell me?
what are you, afraid?
no.
you just like to be in control.
I get it.
I figured as much.
sorry I asked. Won't happen again.
I accidentally set my grandmother's house on fire when I was six.
caused a blackout in four counties in ohio when I was eight.
I spent my ninth birthday in a glass room with an iv of lithium in my arm.
I've lived in this building for 16 years.
ever since the shrinks diagnosed me as a sociopath with paranoid delusions.
but they were just out to get me because I threatened to kill 'em.
I'm 24 years old, and I've never gone on a date.
never been on a roller coaster.
never been swimming.
and now you know everything there is to know about me.
I don't have the luxury of being more interesting than that.
later, alligator.
word to the wise, friend.
I would keep my distance from that one.
I caved in a desperate moment six years ago, and I'm still payingthe price.
don't worry.
I don't want anything from her except the drugs.
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting.
you still believe them.
what do you mean?
this cure of theirs.
they've been days awayfrom perfecting it since I got here 30 years ago.
Bob's not trying to fix you, peter.
no. They created this facility to help us.
you're not in a facility, peter.
look around.
you're in a prison.
you don't believe me?
why don't you try getting out?
2 months ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
are you all right?
he said it was all a lie.
what happened to him, and...
to peter, and the car crash.
I take it he told you he thought he could fly.
and the plotto blow up new york.
that peter was a bomb.
it must be the pain medication.
you deserve to know this.
I tried to keep it from you and the boys.
what?
there's a dark secret in the petrelli family.
it started with their father.
delusions of grandeur, paranoia.
it lead to his suicide. But sadly...
that disease has obviously been passed down.
my god.
Now...nathan's a great man.
and his life is gonna be very complicated.
he really deserves his dignity and his...
his privacy.
so I hope you understand that this has to be kept secret.
can I count on you for that, heidi?
Hi, what can I do to get you inside a... hi...
Hi. What can I do to get you into a brand new car?
Hi, what can I do...
depends on what you're gonna do to me once you get me inside.
I got a great feeling about your first day.
my butterflies have butterflies.
Nik, I am so proud of you.
I knew that medication would work out.
you were right.
I'm gonna take micah to school. - Okay.
you have a great day at work.
and when I get home tonight, we're gonna celebrate.
he's gonna know you're not taking the stupid pills.
go away, jessica.
I don't need you anymore.
what makes you think this is jessica?
remember me?
that summer that you ran away to L. A.And told everyone to call you gina?
you're not real.
Oh, you're gonna sell cars?
I'm going back to L. A.To go play.
no, I'm in control.
if I can handle jessica, I can handle you.
then why aren't you taking your meds?
No!
No!
look, I need to see my family.
just for a day or two.
Yes, I-I think that would be absolutely possible.
just not right now.
why not?
they don't even know I'm alive.
look, I could let you go, and you could explode again.
you could blow up half the east coast.
okay, so dose meomwith se drugs and I'll be back before they wear off.
it's perfectly safe.
I'm sorry, peter.
you're just not ready for that yet.
okay, so send someone out with me.
Elle, maybe.
uh, no. No, no, I'm sorry, peter.
um, that's just not gonna happen.
I'm never getting out of here, am I?
suddenly the room starts to feel like a cage.
I don't understand.
if they're not gonna help us, why are we here?
to keep us from being out there.
why, because we're dangerous?
no, peter, it's because we could save the world.
years ago, I tried to take my abilities public.
I thought that if everyone knew that my blood had curing powers, I could help.
how naive I was.
that's why they put you in here.
well, if it were possible to kill me, they would have, I assure you.
instead, I'm locked up in here.
when I could be curing your brother.
Nathan. How?
just a small amount of my blood could help to heal him.
end his pain.
even after everything you've put him through.
so how do we get out?
my daughter is still in there!
please! Please!
Hawkins! Hawkins, get out of there!
mommy!
Mommy!...
thank you!
Yeah, good one, D.L.
this is kcei channel 9 news reporting on a house fire, we've just heard, in the clark county district.
near tragedy was avoided...
dad!
Hey.
I saw you on tv!
they keep on playing it over and over!
you really are a hero.
I guess I am.
Where's your mom?
I don't think she's gotten home from work yet.
gone to LA c ya 1 months ago.
you're not gonna give me a little jolt?
why, you want one?
like you said, I'm starting to like 'em.
starting to like you.
fine, since you asked nicely.
enough fun for one day?
day number five without the meds.
then I think it's time to try.
come on, peter.
you can do it.
it's niceto finally meet you.
you know, for 400 years, you've held up pretty well.
come on, let's go heal your brother.

anything you want, you just gotta ask.
you know that, don't you?
thank you.
I've taken care of everything.
plane tickets, money.
now this.
I'm so sorry, nathan.
how long until it starts working?
we don't have time to find out.
they're going to assume that you'll come to see your brother.
this is the first place they'll look.
come on.
Adam, look, look, look!
good.
come on.
come on.
that was incredible.
his skin was starting to heal right there in front of us.
he'll be as good as new by the time he wakes up.
here, passport.
plane ticket.
here's the plan.
you disappointed me, peter!
and just when I thought we were getting to know each other.
there's a warehouse in montreal.
121 rue saint-jacques.
meet there.
go after him!
you take me back there, I'm just gonna keep escaping.
I'm not taking you back.
you deserve a better fate.
your mother helped me when I was in need.
so now you're helping me?
you must start a new life, peter.
I fear this is the only solution.
your secret is safe with me.
go with god, my friend.
there are many ways to define our fragile existence.
many ways to give it meaning.
but it is our memories that shape its purpose and give it context.
today
the private assortment of images, fears, loves, regrets.
thank you.
Yeah.
for it is the cruel irony of life that we are destined to holdthe dark with the light, the good with the evil.
success with disappointment.
this is what separates us, what makes us human.
and in the end, we must fight to hold on to.
present day
I remember.
I remember everything.
good, then.
shall we save the world?
as long as I have breath, anything you love, I will lay to waste.
Jessica wasn't the strong one.
it was you.
Adam was dangeous so we locked him up, we threw away the key.
two weeks ago, he escapes.
and now he wants revenge.
who are you?
what's your name?
I don't know.
I'm from new york.
who's that?
I wish I knew.
someone knew I was coming.
the name am doesn't ring a bell?
no, and I don't know about any company.
please tell me who I am.
what the future holds.
I was in montreal in 2007.
next thing I know, I'm here.
all these people died from the virus.
you can change history. - I can'T.
you must!
don't let them take me!
No!
it is man's ability to remember that sets us apart.
we are the only species concerned with the past.
Peter petrelli montreal
our memories give us voice.
they bear witness to history so that others might learn.
so they might celebrate our triumphs.
and be warned of our failures.
I don't know any adam.
Peter, what the hell was that?
do you know me?
of course I know you.
Peter, it's me, adam.
don't you remember?
together we're going to change history.
sorry, I don'T...
so the haitian's taken liberties with your mind.
Haitian.
that explains why you fell off the face of the earth.
you can get back your memory.
I know how.
how?
healing.
you can do what I can do.
which means the mind has to repair itself.
how do you suggest I go about doing that?
think about what matters most to you.
do you know what that is?
his name is nathan.
you saved the cheerleader...
four months ago so we could save the world.
you gotta let me go, nathan!
you go, I go!
No!
I'll be okay.
you can fly, I can't!
what do you mean?
it's taking everything in me, all my power not to explode!
let me go!
niki&micah roosevelt hospital, manhattan - Nicole sanders? - Here.

the surgery was successful.
he's a lucky man.

officer?
officer, can you help us over here, please?
did you have to use the full blast on him?
he can take it.
he's not a toy, elle.
he could be.
where am I?
someplace safe.
my brother...I was in a hospital.
we have the finest doctors in the world working on him.
but his situation is dire.
so who are you?
what am I doing here?
I am an old friend of your parents'.
Yeah, I've seen you before.
and as I said before, you're safe here.
but your brother...
that's a different story.
he almost died.
because of you, peter.
Hey, it's not like it was your idea to go nuclear and take out half of new york city.
Oh, you know about that?
Yes, as long as your abilities are in control of you, you will always be a hazard to yourself, to your family...
the whole world.
believe me, if I could turn them off, I would.
don't worry, we've done that for you.
at least for now.
how did you...
my colleague here is able to suppress the abilities in people around him.
I don't understand.
what is this place?
you are in a facility designed to help people just like you.
Peter, we can help you go back to a normal life.
30 years ago, we had to shut down research on a vaccine which could disable your powers.
but due to recent events, we have reinstated that research.
and I'm very happy to say that we're very close to finding a cure for you.
forever?
you will never have to worry about hurting anyone you love again.
how long until it's ready?
good!
you're making the right choice.
good boy.
you have hada terrible accident.
he's missing.
he's missing, nathan.
the coast guard is searching 100 square miles of the ocean.
but you're lucky to be alive.
no. Oh, no no no.
dad!
Oh, big guy.
I thought I lost you.
girl, I told you.
you're never getting rid of me.
Mrs. Sanders...
I'll be right back, okay?
I'll be here.
Dr. Brooks.
um, I wanted you to know that we don't have insurance.
but I'm surethat we can come up...
you don't have to worry about that.
it's all been taken care of.
I don't understand.
how? Who paid?
uh, that'd be me.
do I know you?
call me bob.
did you happen to see a morning newspaper?
what?
no, why?
not a mention of what happened last night on kirby plaza.
or the untimely deathof our friend mr. Linderman.
who the hell are you?
someone who wants to help.
Linderman made a mess of things and I'm here to right the ship.
so to speak.
okay.
you've done that by paying our bills.
no, I meant helping you with your illness.
I know you think jessica is gone.
how do you know about that?
but we've discovered that when these abilities manifest, the way the mind deals with the new reality sometimes results in a fracture of sorts.
a split personality.
no, I'm finished with jessica.
how do you know a new personality won't emerge?
I can get you all the help you need.
the best care in the world.
what's the catch?
the catch is you have to leave your family and enter the program.
I just went through hell to get my family back together.
I'm not leaving them now.
there is medication you can try at home, but...
but what?
it's not without side effects.
and as you just said, you've been through so much for your family.
do you really wanna risk...
losing them all again?
so I just take these pills every day?
Yep.
it's a little cocktail they cooked up here in the lab.
it controls the abilities.
dampens them.
like that guy who was standing in the corner of bob's office.
the haitian. Yeah.
Sorta.
so let's just call them...haitian pills.
Bye, peter.
that hurts.
you'll get used to it.
and then you'll start to like it.
Hello?
who said that?
me.
3 months ago.
it's micah's birthday today all right! 11 years old.
almost the man of the house now.
mom?
did you make a wish, baby?
don't tell us.'Cause you know it's not gonna come true.
you both already know what I wished for, anyways.
Micah, we've been over this.
but I've got it all figured out.
I could make the car radio pick up the police band.
we could go to the crime scene and be heroes.
or the police could just take care of it.
we could be like the fantastic four.
minus one. But still.
Micah, I wanna be a hero to you.
and I finally figured out how to do that.
I think I got a job.
a good job.
doing what?
something that's gonna make you proud of me, I promise.
come on. I promised I'd take you bowling, right?
let's go.
mom, you coming?
your mom's had a long day, micah.
go get your jacket.
all I want is to smile at my boy on his birthday, and I can't even do that.
they said it's just gonna take a little while for the medication to level out.
I just don't know how much longer I can do this.
I wanna say things'll get better.
but I know how that sounds.
the truth is, they will.
you know, it's been a month.
you still haven't told me your name.
please, I just wanna be left alone.
you came to the right place.
I have to warn you, though, it does get a bit old.
let me guess.
you were living a perfectly ordinary life.
until one day you discovered you could do incredible things.
I bet it was wonderful at first.
you thought perhaps you could save the world.
and then you realized, tragically, that you were dangerous.
I'll let you talk to me after a decade.
Oh, actually, talk to me after three.
if they wanna leave me in here forever, that's fine by me.
you've been through something awful, haven't you?
I'm sorry.
I'm peter.
Hello, peter.
it's nice to meet you.
I'm adam.
2 months ago.
I'm not in the mood today, elle.
just a little one?
I'll up your dose.
I'm fine.
just a little one.
not that a fistful of pills everyday isn't fun, but...
it's been two months now and I still don't know a thing about you.
I was just thinking...
maybe there's more to you than the whole sadistic lightning thing, that's all.
what's your story?
I liked you better when you just laid there.
so you're not gonna tell me?
what are you, afraid?
no.
you just like to be in control.
I get it.
I figured as much.
sorry I asked. Won't happen again.
I accidentally set my grandmother's house on fire when I was six.
caused a blackout in four counties in ohio when I was eight.
I spent my ninth birthday in a glass room with an iv of lithium in my arm.
I've lived in this building for 16 years.
ever since the shrinks diagnosed me as a sociopath with paranoid delusions.
but they were just out to get me because I threatened to kill 'em.
I'm 24 years old, and I've never gone on a date.
never been on a roller coaster.
never been swimming.
and now you know everything there is to know about me.
I don't have the luxury of being more interesting than that.
later, alligator.
word to the wise, friend.
I would keep my distance from that one.
I caved in a desperate moment six years ago, and I'm still payingthe price.
don't worry.
I don't want anything from her except the drugs.
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting.
you still believe them.
what do you mean?
this cure of theirs.
they've been days awayfrom perfecting it since I got here 30 years ago.
Bob's not trying to fix you, peter.
no. They created this facility to help us.
you're not in a facility, peter.
look around.
you're in a prison.
you don't believe me?
why don't you try getting out?
2 months ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
are you all right?
he said it was all a lie.
what happened to him, and...
to peter, and the car crash.
I take it he told you he thought he could fly.
and the plotto blow up new york.
that peter was a bomb.
it must be the pain medication.
you deserve to know this.
I tried to keep it from you and the boys.
what?
there's a dark secret in the petrelli family.
it started with their father.
delusions of grandeur, paranoia.
it lead to his suicide. But sadly...
that disease has obviously been passed down.
my god.
Now...nathan's a great man.
and his life is gonna be very complicated.
he really deserves his dignity and his...
his privacy.
so I hope you understand that this has to be kept secret.
can I count on you for that, heidi?
Hi, what can I do to get you inside a... hi...
Hi. What can I do to get you into a brand new car?
Hi, what can I do...
depends on what you're gonna do to me once you get me inside.
I got a great feeling about your first day.
my butterflies have butterflies.
Nik, I am so proud of you.
I knew that medication would work out.
you were right.
I'm gonna take micah to school. - Okay.
you have a great day at work.
and when I get home tonight, we're gonna celebrate.
he's gonna know you're not taking the stupid pills.
go away, jessica.
I don't need you anymore.
what makes you think this is jessica?
remember me?
that summer that you ran away to L. A.And told everyone to call you gina?
you're not real.
Oh, you're gonna sell cars?
I'm going back to L. A.To go play.
no, I'm in control.
if I can handle jessica, I can handle you.
then why aren't you taking your meds?
No!
No!
look, I need to see my family.
just for a day or two.
Yes, I-I think that would be absolutely possible.
just not right now.
why not?
they don't even know I'm alive.
look, I could let you go, and you could explode again.
you could blow up half the east coast.
okay, so dose meomwith se drugs and I'll be back before they wear off.
it's perfectly safe.
I'm sorry, peter.
you're just not ready for that yet.
okay, so send someone out with me.
Elle, maybe.
uh, no. No, no, I'm sorry, peter.
um, that's just not gonna happen.
I'm never getting out of here, am I?
suddenly the room starts to feel like a cage.
I don't understand.
if they're not gonna help us, why are we here?
to keep us from being out there.
why, because we're dangerous?
no, peter, it's because we could save the world.
years ago, I tried to take my abilities public.
I thought that if everyone knew that my blood had curing powers, I could help.
how naive I was.
that's why they put you in here.
well, if it were possible to kill me, they would have, I assure you.
instead, I'm locked up in here.
when I could be curing your brother.
Nathan. How?
just a small amount of my blood could help to heal him.
end his pain.
even after everything you've put him through.
so how do we get out?
my daughter is still in there!
please! Please!
Hawkins! Hawkins, get out of there!
mommy!
Mommy!...
thank you!
Yeah, good one, D.L.
this is kcei channel 9 news reporting on a house fire, we've just heard, in the clark county district.
near tragedy was avoided...
dad!
Hey.
I saw you on tv!
they keep on playing it over and over!
you really are a hero.
I guess I am.
Where's your mom?
I don't think she's gotten home from work yet.
gone to LA c ya 1 months ago.
you're not gonna give me a little jolt?
why, you want one?
like you said, I'm starting to like 'em.
starting to like you.
fine, since you asked nicely.
enough fun for one day?
day number five without the meds.
then I think it's time to try.
come on, peter.
you can do it.
it's niceto finally meet you.
you know, for 400 years, you've held up pretty well.
come on, let's go heal your brother.
zulia venezuela i knew i couldn't hide forever it's time to come home Maya everuone has been looking for answers...

think about it.
you didn't die. Of all of them, you were the only one!

this thing we can do, it only begins at reading minds.
and then it becomes so much more.
you are the hero Kensei?
everything he's ever painted has come true.
have they given you a gun?
her name is Claire Bennet.
you remember her father, Noah?
you're saying we should kill him?
I'm saying we should be prepared.
I have been working with Bennet to take down this company.
why are you telling me this now?
he found us.
the man who abducted me.
we've gotta get out of here.
that's what I've been trying to tell you.
the guy in the glasses is my father.
it's not safe here anymore.
pack your bags. We're moving.
Costa VERDE, CA
what are you wearing?
my uniform.
I have a pep rally today.
well, maybe I didn't make myself clear.
we're leaving costa verde today.
you made yourself plenty clear.
I'm not leaving.
go change out of that outfit or I will...
or you'll what?
abduct me?
experiment on me?
erase my memory?
that's what you did, isn't it, dad?
and then you inject them with some sort of...
you are talking about things you don't understand.
actually, I do understand.
you abducted West.
what?
when he was, like, 12.
when he saw you yesterday, I have never seen anyone so terrified.
what are you talking about, Claire?
dad does not abduct people.
dad is a bad guy, Lyle.
he's a liar. Don't listen to a word he says.
would you stop defending him?
that's all you do.
I mean, look at us!
moving, lying, changing our names.
all I want is for you to have a safe and normal life.
this isn't about me.
this is all about you and the things you've done.
if you and your boyfriend hadn't showboated, none of...
stop using that as an excuse.
no matter what I do, this is never gonna end, is it, dad?
we'll always be running.
do not walk out of that door!
what are you gonna do... tie me up?
if I have to.
enough!
Noah, put down the tape.
Claire, go to school, say good-bye to your friends, then come right home.
we are leaving tonight.
you got it?
I hate you.
chapter nine cautionary tales
tokyo JAPAN It is tradition that the eldest son speak in honor of the deceased.
Hiro, are you okay?
no, I came back too late. Now he's dead. We don't even know who killed him. It's all my fault. No, it's not, Hiro. Now go back up there, honor your father. No, to eulogize him is to admit he is gone, and I'm not ready to let him go. I must go back in time. Hiro, please, Hiro. One week ago New York city
I do not take death threats idly.
so you think one of us sent these?
Yes, for the pain we caused, the people we have killed.
there is no end to our suffering.
Brooklyn, NY
good morning.
morning!
how'd you sleep?
on my pillow.
no nightmares, no nightmare man?
no.
good.
what were you looking at?
that's a puzzle.
people in that photo fit together somehow.
some of 'em got hurt, and I'm trying to find the rest so that no one else has to.
I can find them for you.
no. No, you won't.
I made that mistake once.
I'm never gonna ask you to do that again.
sit down, eat breakfast.
I want you to be a normal little girl.
I'm not normal.
I can find people.
all right, you wanna help?
come here.
if you wanna help, help me put the nightmare man behind us, so we can get back to normal. Okay?
and just be a little girl.
go to school, have fun.
and I'll be... an underpaid cop.
deal?
but why can't we?
just do it, okay?
for me?
okay, I'll do it for you.
back to normal.
come back and finish your cereal.
Costa VERDE, CA
welcome to Costa Verde.
how we gonna do this?
swiftly.
we grab Claire, we take out her father.
we get out.
when you say "take out," you mean kill?
it is a euphemism.
word choice aside, I never agreed to take out anybody.
you were loyal to Bennet. I get that.
the two of you were going to take down the company.
but you made the right choice in telling me the truth.
I'm not choosing sides.
this is about Claire's blood curing Niki.
I'm just trying to do the right thing for everyone.
that's what I like about you, dr. Suresh.
your moral compass always faces true north.
which is why you're going to get a new partner.
one who can execute.
one whose compass faces north-northwest.
I hope you're using sunscreen.
Ugh. Overprotective, much?
Dr. Suresh, I would like you to meet my daughter, Elle.
your daughter?
she's the executioner?
what's your super power... punching bag?
have you been working on your sharp shooting?
I don't want you to get too close to Bennet.
Hey, fight club... check this out.
what's your deal?
I figured this was your flight path to school.
you don't have to pretend anymore, Claire.
the jig is kinda up, spy girl.
I'm not pretending.
and I'm not a spy, I swear.
I'm just...
I'm just a cheerleader.
so this is all a big coincidence?
that your dad just happens to be the guy who abducted me?
then why didn't you just tell me?
I was selfish.
you liked me.
you were like me.
and I thought... that if I told you...
it would just mess everything up.
and I guess it did.
my family's leaving town.
when?
tonight.
but I'm not going with them.
I'm staying here because of you.
I wanna believe you.
but I don't.
I need to go figure things out.
Yes, I've been on hold waiting for a special agent...
no, some of that interdepartmental cooperation I've been hearing so much about on the news.
Yes, I'll hold.
what are you doing?
I was on hold with the FBI.
well, I want you to tell me why you're on hold with the FBI.
because I'm trying to get some information on the Kaito Nakamura case.
the Kaito Nakamura case is closed.
angela Petrelli confessed, partner.
Yeah, but she didn't do it.
there's something bigger going on here.
I don't know what it is, but these guys are involved in some kind of, uh, organization, like from back in the '70s.
like a disco?
No...no.
like a research facility.
I was there yesterday.
all these guys--Nakamura, Linderman, Arthur Petrelli, my dad, and this Adam Monroe guy.
your dad?
Yeah.
let it go.
you got real work to do.
this is real work!
and it's important.
lives could be at stake.
your job could be at stake if you keep this up, Parkman.
now, I need you back on the planet earth.
you got me?
no.
excuse me, detective?
give me 24 hours.
let me talk to Angela Petrelli again.
tell you what.
you got 24 hours.
talk to Angela Petrelli again.
then you're done.
thank you.
great idea.
is this him?
he looks a lot younger there.
well, apparently, he can fly.
did you really do what Claire said?
abduct him when he was just a boy?
I thought we were doing good.
saving the world.
honestly, I don't know why I'm not getting in the car with the kids and leaving you.
come here. I want to show you something.
remember that painting I showed you?
the death of Kaito Nakamura.
kind of hard to forget a story about a man who can paint the future.
well, that was one of eight.
I found the other seven yesterday.
that's Claire, isn't it?
is that... - Claire's right.
it's all about me.
and this man with the gun, is he gonna shoot you?
believe me, I've considered it.
but Suresh is one of the good guys.
and you think West has something to do with it?
I don't know, but West is the reason why Claire won't leave town.
and I need to talk to him.
it's all falling apart.
I really need you now.
I'm gonna... take Lyle to school.
hello.
is Molly well enough to use her ability?
Why?
I need to track down a boy, and I don't have time to run all over Costa Verde.
his name is West Rosen.
are you okay? You sound...
can you do it or not?
Yes, of course.
Mohinder... - Yeah?
just...
thank you.
that was Bennet.
does he know we're here?
no.
he just wanted some information.
a location of a boy.
maybe we can use this to our advantage.
how so?
we feed him a false location.
we isolate him.
we get him away from Claire.
we don't have to kill him.
do you know what happens when you change your plans mid-stream?
no.
neither do I.
because we don't do it.
let me put it this way.
we do it my way, or I blow the whistle right now.
tell Bennet everything.
Bennet is dangerous.
you saw what he did to his mentor in the Ukraine.
don't you think if push came to shove, he's do the same to you?
no. I don't.
he's adorable.
can I keep him?
Okay...We do it the doctor's way.
I sought redemption by helping Hiro fulfil his destiny to save the world.
how did you help your son?
I'm leaving for Japan tonight.
I suggest you disappear as well.
father!
Hiro?!
you've returned.
where have you been, Hiro?
japan, 1671
the time of Takezo Kensei...
you must tell me everything.
later. Right now, we must leave, you are going to die! Here! Tonight!
how do you know this?
I've just come from your funeral.
my funeral?
this is my fate then.
it doesn't have to be...
we have the power of gods.
that does not mean we can play god.
no, you are being stubborn.
and you are letting your emotions cloud your judgement.
you felt this way once.
I was young, but I remember.
in fact...I will show you
where are you going?
I can't just wait around
he goes to school with Claire
and I know where that is
remember me?
then you know I don't have super strength
I can't hold on forever
what do you want?
answers!
we took you to study your abilities!
I don't care about any of that!
is she working with you? Or for you?
did she ever really care about me?
Claire never even mentioned you existed!
you hear me?
she lied to me!
so I'm guessing you're pretty important to her
you listen to me very carefully
I am taking Claire
we are leaving town
and you are gonna convince her that's the right thing to do - Hello - I just spoke to Molly
she's located West. He's in Costa Verde
corner of Verbena and Palm
right now? Are you sure?
Molly's ability has pinpoint accuracy
but I can't guarantee that he'll be there forever
you should get there quickly
okay
I'll head right over
what's going on?
Claire's in danger
I need your help
Claire Butler, bring it on in!
Hey, we missed you this morning
is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's great
good. Come here
this is Mr. Bishop from the state board of education
he needs to talk to you about the Debbie incident
please...
call me Bob - Am I in trouble? - No, no, no
just wanna ask you a couple questions. May we walk?
Yeah, sure
we take underage drinking very seriously
of course
you haven't seen any other incidents of drinking, hazing?
no, sir, none
you wouldn't lie to me, would you?
no, sir
because an incident like this can ruin a girl's life
you wouldn't wanna do that, would you, Miss Bennet?
what did you just call me?
have you killed many people?
how is that any of your business?
I guess it's not
let me talk to him first. Alone
you sure?
I am
he trusts me
what are you doing here?
I'm sorry I lied to you. I only have a second
you have to listen to me
are they forcing you to do this? Do they have Molly?
nobody is forcing me to do anything
I'm here to ask you to give us Claire
we need her blood
you've gone native
are you kidding me?
she'll be returned to you safe, unharmed
you have my word
no offense, Mohinder, but your word isn't what it used to be
Claire is very important to the work we're doing
she can save lives. "The work we're doing." You sound like me ten years ago
this is what they do: They indoctrinate you
I couldn't have been more clear about this when you agreed to go in
they're not who you think they are
they are not getting Claire
I have to do what I think is right
start driving
please
dad!
mom?!
Claire? - Mom!
this guy showed up at my school - He knew our real name - What?
dad was right
I messed up, and they found us. We gotta go
go where?
what is this?
that's why your father's been acting so strangely...
he thinks that's gonna happen, he was a very talented artist, and incredibly accurate
good to see you again, Sandra - You know him? - Yeah
he was the regional sales manager of Primatech Paper - So who's your partner? - Excuse me?
company policy
one of them, one of us
who's yours?
you know her?
Oh, yeah
Hey, you you lie to me, betray me
you come after my daughter
how did you think it was gonna end?
Mr. Butler...
what are you doing?
no one's taking my little girl
he took Claire. Your old boss Bob
what the hell is going on?
it's okay - We're gonna get her back - How, Noah?
I've got collateral - What do you mean, collateral?
Hi, Mrs. Butler
it's good to, uh... see you again
did you pack Mr. Muggles' doggy bath?
I need to speak to your father
what do you think... this is my first day?
stings like a bitch, doesn't it?
I know all about your ability, Elle
you don't know anything about me
I was there
when your father first brought you in
you were a normal girl
unicorns and rainbows
and then they started the testing
the human brain isn't built to take that much electricity
you poor girl
my father would never let that happen
your father was leading the charge
I don't remember any of that
no memories, huh?
kind of like someone took them away?
why do you think I never let the company anywhere near Claire?
I didn't want her to become you
now I need to talk to your father to arrange a trade
Claire for you
what if he doesn't wanna make a deal?
you'd be surprised what a father would do for his daughter
Elle, where are you?
you touch my daughter and I'll kill yours - And then I'll kill you - Noah?
we'll be at the imperial beach parking lot in two hours
well, looks like you and I are going to the beach
I'll do whatever you want, okay?
just promise me you'll leave my dad alone
I wish it were that easy. Unfortunately, he's got my daughter
let me talk to him. He'll listen to me
he's not big on the listening
and once he sets his mind, it's stuck
which is why we gave you to him in the first place
we thought he would be loyal to the end
turns out we were right
it's too bad, really
you'd be an excellent addition to the team, Claire
you, your blood
you can help a lot of people
good
take my blood. Take as much as you want, but leave my dad alone
no one has to die where are we?
aoyama Cemetery
when are we?
it's 17 years ago.
mother has just passed away.
why have you done this?
you need to understand my pain.
the reason I need to save you
don't you remeber your heartche when she died?
it was the saddest day of my life.
but is doesn't change anything.
did you really think this was going to work?
you cannot die.
you foolish boy, Take me beck now
no
sorry...
Oh my god, you are... - I am Takezo Kensei.
Yes.
Yes, you are.
my mother died.
I know. I remember.
why does my father paint the grave?
it is tradition.
the names of husband and wife are carved into stone.
your father paints his own name red as a promise to join your mother.
it will stay that way until he does.
my father's going to die, too?
not for a long time.
No! I must stop it. I am a hero!
some things even Takezo Kensei cannot change.
we cannot play god.
but I must honor him...
listen to him.
learn from his lessons
strength...
responsibility...
and justice
justice?
how?
Hiro!
come here!
you were right, father.
I was being childish. I'm sorry.
I'll take you back.
let us pay our respects, first.
thanks for your help, West.
now go on home to your family.
no way!
I'm going with you.
no, it's too dangerous.
exactly, and I'm the quickest way to get Claire out of there.
all right.
you can wait for me in the car, okay?
they say girls tend to find boys just like their dads.
because he can fly?
no, her real dad. You.
all he cares about is protecting her.
if anything happens...
nothin' is gonna happen, except you bringing Claire back.
I suppose this is...goodbye.
I've never time traveled before.
I'm proud of you, son.
goodbye, father.
please give my love to mother.
of all of them... I never expected it would be you.
sir, I have it.
sir.
sir...
you were right, Ando.
I can't save him.
but I can learn who killed him.
Takezo Kensei.
it can't be.
if you visit me one more time, detective Parkman, I'll expect you to make an honest woman out of me.
that is the plan actually.
are you going to try to read my mind again?
I knew your father when he could do it.
I'm even less impressed with you.
those marks that you have all over you, my father made you do that to yourself, didn't he?
did you know him when his mind reading became something more?
when pull became push, and then he realized he could put a thought into anyone's head?
don't do this.
you are gonna answer every question I have truthfully.
for once.
who really killed Kaito Nakamura?
it was Adam.
your son told me that you and your friends locked him up 30 years ago. Why?
he was dangerous. - Dangerous how? Like a bomb?
no, worse.
we thought he was just able to heal.
cellular regeneration.
like Claire, your granddaughter.
what we didn't know is that if your cells continually regenerate, after a while, you stop growing old.
what's old?
400 years.
do you know where Adam is now?
all I know is that he wants revenge for locking him up, and he's not gonna rest until all of us are dead.
all of you are, except for you, Bob, my dad, and this woman in the photo.
who is this woman?
Please...don't do this.
I need you to tell me the truth.
the truth... the truth... is that our generation mortgaged our souls to protect yours.
show a little respect for that.
get over your daddy issues and leave us be!
tell me the truth.
who is she?
all she wants is to be left alone.
I made her a promise.
if you take this secret from me, you're not just like your father...
you are him.
what kind of car do you drive?
excuse me?
I know you can fly, but you're still a teenager.
you do have a car, right?
Yeah, it's a piece of crap suv.
I drove a 52 Citroen when I was your age.
Oh, those things are awesome.
now once we get Claire, you fly her out immediately.
no matter what else happens.
you understand me?
Yes, sir.
it doesn't have to be this way, Noah.
dad, the painting!
no matter what I do... we'll always be running.
but if you die, Bob... the company dies with you.
please, don't do this.
dad!
the last thing I really said to my dad was "I hate you."
you didn't mean it.
no, I did.
I keep playing it over and over.
now I'll never get a chance to take it back.
I refuse to eulogize my father.
to eulogize him is to admit he is gone.
my father is not dead...
Kaito Nakamura taught me right from wrong.
what it means to be a hero...
so long as the lessons live on through me...
he will never die.
my father taught me to understand that certain things are in god's hands.
but for everything else God has given us the gift of choice.
my father gave me the tools to fight the battles ahead.
every hand I extend in kindness is his hand.
and every blow that I strike for justice is his fist.
so long as the lessons he taught stay with me.
and so long as he lives on in my heart.
then my father is never truly dead.
holy
to be continued
of all of them...
I never expected it would be you.
Kaito!
Hiro...your father he's dead murdered.
this thing we can do, it only begins at reading minds.
and then it becomes so much more.
you are the hero Kensei?
everything he's ever painted has come true.
have they given you a gun?
her name is Claire Bennet.
you remember her father, Noah?
you're saying we should kill him?
I'm saying we should be prepared.
I have been working with Bennet to take down this company.
why are you telling me this now?
he found us.
the man who abducted me.
we've gotta get out of here.
that's what I've been trying to tell you.
the guy in the glasses is my father.
it's not safe here anymore.
pack your bags. We're moving.
Costa VERDE, CA
what are you wearing?
my uniform.
I have a pep rally today.
well, maybe I didn't make myself clear.
we're leaving costa verde today.
you made yourself plenty clear.
I'm not leaving.
go change out of that outfit or I will...
or you'll what?
abduct me?
experiment on me?
erase my memory?
that's what you did, isn't it, dad?
and then you inject them with some sort of...
you are talking about things you don't understand.
actually, I do understand.
you abducted West.
what?
when he was, like, 12.
when he saw you yesterday, I have never seen anyone so terrified.
what are you talking about, Claire?
dad does not abduct people.
dad is a bad guy, Lyle.
he's a liar. Don't listen to a word he says.
would you stop defending him?
that's all you do.
I mean, look at us!
moving, lying, changing our names.
all I want is for you to have a safe and normal life.
this isn't about me.
this is all about you and the things you've done.
if you and your boyfriend hadn't showboated, none of...
stop using that as an excuse.
no matter what I do, this is never gonna end, is it, dad?
we'll always be running.
do not walk out of that door!
what are you gonna do... tie me up?
if I have to.
enough!
Noah, put down the tape.
Claire, go to school, say good-bye to your friends, then come right home.
we are leaving tonight.
you got it?
I hate you.
chapter nine cautionary tales
tokyo JAPAN It is tradition that the eldest son speak in honor of the deceased.
Hiro, are you okay?
no, I came back too late. Now he's dead. We don't even know who killed him. It's all my fault. No, it's not, Hiro. Now go back up there, honor your father. No, to eulogize him is to admit he is gone, and I'm not ready to let him go. I must go back in time. Hiro, please, Hiro. One week ago New York city
I do not take death threats idly.
so you think one of us sent these?
Yes, for the pain we caused, the people we have killed.
there is no end to our suffering.
Brooklyn, NY
good morning.
morning!
how'd you sleep?
on my pillow.
no nightmares, no nightmare man?
no.
good.
what were you looking at?
that's a puzzle.
people in that photo fit together somehow.
some of 'em got hurt, and I'm trying to find the rest so that no one else has to.
I can find them for you.
no. No, you won't.
I made that mistake once.
I'm never gonna ask you to do that again.
sit down, eat breakfast.
I want you to be a normal little girl.
I'm not normal.
I can find people.
all right, you wanna help?
come here.
if you wanna help, help me put the nightmare man behind us, so we can get back to normal. Okay?
and just be a little girl.
go to school, have fun.
and I'll be... an underpaid cop.
deal?
but why can't we?
just do it, okay?
for me?
okay, I'll do it for you.
back to normal.
come back and finish your cereal.
Costa VERDE, CA
welcome to Costa Verde.
how we gonna do this?
swiftly.
we grab Claire, we take out her father.
we get out.
when you say "take out," you mean kill?
it is a euphemism.
word choice aside, I never agreed to take out anybody.
you were loyal to Bennet. I get that.
the two of you were going to take down the company.
but you made the right choice in telling me the truth.
I'm not choosing sides.
this is about Claire's blood curing Niki.
I'm just trying to do the right thing for everyone.
that's what I like about you, dr. Suresh.
your moral compass always faces true north.
which is why you're going to get a new partner.
one who can execute.
one whose compass faces north-northwest.
I hope you're using sunscreen.
Ugh. Overprotective, much?
Dr. Suresh, I would like you to meet my daughter, Elle.
your daughter?
she's the executioner?
what's your super power... punching bag?
have you been working on your sharp shooting?
I don't want you to get too close to Bennet.
Hey, fight club... check this out.
what's your deal?
I figured this was your flight path to school.
you don't have to pretend anymore, Claire.
the jig is kinda up, spy girl.
I'm not pretending.
and I'm not a spy, I swear.
I'm just...
I'm just a cheerleader.
so this is all a big coincidence?
that your dad just happens to be the guy who abducted me?
then why didn't you just tell me?
I was selfish.
you liked me.
you were like me.
and I thought... that if I told you...
it would just mess everything up.
and I guess it did.
my family's leaving town.
when?
tonight.
but I'm not going with them.
I'm staying here because of you.
I wanna believe you.
but I don't.
I need to go figure things out.
Yes, I've been on hold waiting for a special agent...
no, some of that interdepartmental cooperation I've been hearing so much about on the news.
Yes, I'll hold.
what are you doing?
I was on hold with the FBI.
well, I want you to tell me why you're on hold with the FBI.
because I'm trying to get some information on the Kaito Nakamura case.
the Kaito Nakamura case is closed.
angela Petrelli confessed, partner.
Yeah, but she didn't do it.
there's something bigger going on here.
I don't know what it is, but these guys are involved in some kind of, uh, organization, like from back in the '70s.
like a disco?
No...no.
like a research facility.
I was there yesterday.
all these guys--Nakamura, Linderman, Arthur Petrelli, my dad, and this Adam Monroe guy.
your dad?
Yeah.
let it go.
you got real work to do.
this is real work!
and it's important.
lives could be at stake.
your job could be at stake if you keep this up, Parkman.
now, I need you back on the planet earth.
you got me?
no.
excuse me, detective?
give me 24 hours.
let me talk to Angela Petrelli again.
tell you what.
you got 24 hours.
talk to Angela Petrelli again.
then you're done.
thank you.
great idea.
is this him?
he looks a lot younger there.
well, apparently, he can fly.
did you really do what Claire said?
abduct him when he was just a boy?
I thought we were doing good.
saving the world.
honestly, I don't know why I'm not getting in the car with the kids and leaving you.
come here. I want to show you something.
remember that painting I showed you?
the death of Kaito Nakamura.
kind of hard to forget a story about a man who can paint the future.
well, that was one of eight.
I found the other seven yesterday.
that's Claire, isn't it?
is that... - Claire's right.
it's all about me.
and this man with the gun, is he gonna shoot you?
believe me, I've considered it.
but Suresh is one of the good guys.
and you think West has something to do with it?
I don't know, but West is the reason why Claire won't leave town.
and I need to talk to him.
it's all falling apart.
I really need you now.
I'm gonna... take Lyle to school.
hello.

you can help a lot of people
good
take my blood. Take as much as you want, but leave my dad alone
no one has to die where are we?
aoyama Cemetery
when are we?
it's 17 years ago.
mother has just passed away.
why have you done this?
you need to understand my pain.
the reason I need to save you
don't you remeber your heartche when she died?
it was the saddest day of my life.
but is doesn't change anything.
did you really think this was going to work?
you cannot die.
you foolish boy, Take me beck now
no
sorry...
Oh my god, you are... - I am Takezo Kensei.
Yes.
Yes, you are.
my mother died.
I know. I remember.
why does my father paint the grave?
it is tradition.
the names of husband and wife are carved into stone.
your father paints his own name red as a promise to join your mother.
it will stay that way until he does.
my father's going to die, too?
not for a long time.
No! I must stop it. I am a hero!
some things even Takezo Kensei cannot change.
we cannot play god.
but I must honor him...
listen to him.
learn from his lessons
strength...
responsibility...
and justice
justice?
how?
Hiro!
come here!
you were right, father.
I was being childish. I'm sorry.
I'll take you back.
let us pay our respects, first.
thanks for your help, West.
now go on home to your family.
no way!
I'm going with you.
no, it's too dangerous.
exactly, and I'm the quickest way to get Claire out of there.
all right.
you can wait for me in the car, okay?
they say girls tend to find boys just like their dads.
because he can fly?
no, her real dad. You.
all he cares about is protecting her.
if anything happens...
nothin' is gonna happen, except you bringing Claire back.
I suppose this is...goodbye.
I've never time traveled before.
I'm proud of you, son.
goodbye, father.
please give my love to mother.
of all of them... I never expected it would be you.
sir, I have it.
sir.
sir...
you were right, Ando.
I can't save him.
but I can learn who killed him.
Takezo Kensei.
it can't be.
if you visit me one more time, detective Parkman, I'll expect you to make an honest woman out of me.
that is the plan actually.
are you going to try to read my mind again?
I knew your father when he could do it.
I'm even less impressed with you.
those marks that you have all over you, my father made you do that to yourself, didn't he?
did you know him when his mind reading became something more?
when pull became push, and then he realized he could put a thought into anyone's head?
don't do this.
you are gonna answer every question I have truthfully.
for once.
who really killed Kaito Nakamura?
it was Adam.
your son told me that you and your friends locked him up 30 years ago. Why?
he was dangerous. - Dangerous how? Like a bomb?
no, worse.
we thought he was just able to heal.
cellular regeneration.
like Claire, your granddaughter.
what we didn't know is that if your cells continually regenerate, after a while, you stop growing old.
what's old?
400 years.
do you know where Adam is now?
all I know is that he wants revenge for locking him up, and he's not gonna rest until all of us are dead.
all of you are, except for you, Bob, my dad, and this woman in the photo.
who is this woman?
Please...don't do this.
I need you to tell me the truth.
the truth... the truth... is that our generation mortgaged our souls to protect yours.
show a little respect for that.
get over your daddy issues and leave us be!
tell me the truth.
who is she?
all she wants is to be left alone.
I made her a promise.
if you take this secret from me, you're not just like your father...
you are him.
what kind of car do you drive?
excuse me?
I know you can fly, but you're still a teenager.
you do have a car, right?
Yeah, it's a piece of crap suv.
I drove a 52 Citroen when I was your age.
Oh, those things are awesome.
now once we get Claire, you fly her out immediately.
no matter what else happens.
you understand me?
Yes, sir.
it doesn't have to be this way, Noah.
dad, the painting!
no matter what I do... we'll always be running.
but if you die, Bob... the company dies with you.
please, don't do this.
dad!
the last thing I really said to my dad was "I hate you."
you didn't mean it.
no, I did.
I keep playing it over and over.
now I'll never get a chance to take it back.
I refuse to eulogize my father.
to eulogize him is to admit he is gone.
my father is not dead...
Kaito Nakamura taught me right from wrong.
what it means to be a hero...
so long as the lessons live on through me...
he will never die.
my father taught me to understand that certain things are in god's hands.
but for everything else God has given us the gift of choice.
my father gave me the tools to fight the battles ahead.
every hand I extend in kindness is his hand.
and every blow that I strike for justice is his fist.
so long as the lessons he taught stay with me.
and so long as he lives on in my heart.
then my father is never truly dead.
holy
to be continued
you are going to die! Here! Tonight!
this is my fate then.
I can't save him.
but I can learn who killed him.
when I get back, we'll be together.
you came here to get control of your life.
it's another strain of the virus.
my blood's no longer a cure.
I'm going to die?
Claire is the key that could cure the virus.
and he has asked you to give us Claire.
you touch my daughter and I'll kill yours.
then I'll kill you.
please don't let them take me. - I'll get us home, I promise
no, no!
I remember everything.
I don't trust him, Maya we should put our faith in him.
see, when I get my ability back,
I'm gonna kill you and your sister.
and I'm gonna take it all.
no need to shout.
Adam, I was there. I saw her.
you haven't gone anywhere, Peter.
you were telling me about time travel and how you were going to save some girl from some deadly virus, and then you began shouting her name.
no, no, I was in New York City a year from now.
I saw Caitlin. I was calling at her to come back with me.
look.
impressive.
I have to keep trying.
I can't just leave her there to be killed by the virus.
what do you know about this virus?
I know that it kills over 93% of the world's population.
Peter, do you know what the virus is called?
Shanti virus.
that's what the guy at homeland security called it.
does that mean something to you?
I knew a woman at the company.
she was a biological engineer.
on valentine's day 1977, she recovered a deadly virus from a sick Indian girl named Shanti.
under company orders, she tried to manipulate the virus into a weapon.
I'd heard the program had been shut down.
clearly I was misinformed.
those are my parents.
Linderman, Charles Deveaux. What
those are the company founders, peter.
the virus is their crime.
they're responsible for this.
parents sin, children suffer.
that is Victoria.
we need to find her, Adam.
we need to find her. Make her tell us everything that she knows.
that's the only way to stop the virus and save Caitlin.
it's the only way we can save the world.
get the hell out of my house.
Noah Bennet was a loyal employee of our company, and for many years a true friend.
I offer my deepest condolences.
are those my dad's ashes?
you had my husband cremated?
Yes, his personnel file was very clear as to how his remains should be handled.
what gives you the right?
we were only trying to help Claire use her abilities for the greater good.
but Noah's aggression forced our hand.
he was trying to protect me.
in the wake of this tragedy, I feel it's only fair to honor Noah's wishes.
you will be left alone to lead a normal life.
my father is dead.
there is no normal.
I'm sorry for your loss.
pack your bags.
we're leaving tonight.
the next 24 hours are critical.
I want you to keep an eye on Claire.
it'd be easier without this thing on my arm.
it itches like a mother!
and I thought my little girl was tough.
I am, dad, but I was shot.
and my body doesn't heal itself.
I'm sorry you're in pain, but none of this would've happened if you hadn't lowered your guard.
how was I supposed to know that Bennet teamed up with West, the flying boy?
excuses don't change outcome, Elle.
you need to accept responsibility for what's happened.
can you do that?
can you regain my trust?
sure, daddy.
I'll watch the cheerleader.
chapter Ten Truth&Consequences
take it easy.
last thing I remember...
you were...
Ohh... did you shoot me?
I didn't have a choice.
why am I not dead?
you would have been, if you not for an infusion of your daughter's blood.
you took Claire's blood?
it saved your life.
you betrayed me.
you went after my family!
you told me this company had to be brought down from the inside out.
thank god I came to my senses before I'd done any real damage.
what have you done with Claire?
Claire's at home, grieving the loss of her father.
they think I'm dead.
you put us on this path.
with your violence, your paranoia.
you have nobody to blame but yourself.
what are you doing with that?
your recovery has proven this blood has tremendous regenerative properties.
I believe it holds the key to saving an innocent woman from a deadly virus.
that's what this company does.
we save lives.
everything they've told you is a lie.
the company made that virus.
they've been experimenting with it for 30 years.
you can't trust them, Suresh!
get back here, you son of a bitch!
600 bucks for a comic book?
in mint condition.
but that's not why I collect them.
I just like the stories.
how about this for a story?
once upon a time, we cash these in and live happily ever after, the end.
Hey, if St. Joan's a good guy, why is she wearing a hood?
well, every superhero has to have a secret identity.
how else could they live a normal life?
who wants normal?
Pssh, I'd be rolling large.
let everybody know who I was.
but if your enemies knew who you really were, then they'd be coming after you at home, maybe even taking revenge on your family.
that's why Clark Kent wears those glasses.
right.
mom, you came back!
I told you that I would.
I missed you every day.
Oh, I missed you every minute, every second.
what's that even smaller one?
a nanosecond.
I missed you that one too.
so where were you, mom?
I went to a place that helps people like us when we're sick.
is it Jessica again?
no, Jessica's gone.
they all are.
this is about something else.
what is it?
I have a virus.
you don't have to worry.
I can't make you or anybody else sick.
what's gonna happen to you?
do you remember Dr. Suresh?
he is working really hard to find me a cure.
and when he does, I'll get better.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't?
he will.
I am going to get better, Micah.
we are going to have normal life.
I promise you.
I've got something to make you stronger.
Oh, yeah?
what's that?
dad's medal.
the one that the mayor gave him for saving that girl from the fire.
it's in my backpack.
we can't waste another nanosecond.
what's wrong, bud?
it's my backpack.
it's gone.
it's beautiful here, Gabriel.
thank you.
I almost feel normal.
after you see Dr. Suresh, you will be.
and then Alejandro and I can go back home.
what if Alejandro could go home now?
but I need my brother.
he's the only one who can stop me from hurting anyone else.
what if you could learn... to control your own power?
I've seen people's powers grow.
do you love your brother enough to let him go?
of course.
it's... it's just not possible.
well, you'll never know... unless you try.
we should get back.
you put him through enough, Maya.
me?
he gave up his entire life for you even after you killed his wife.
it was an accident.
you really think he's forgiven you?
she was cheating on him.
so she deserved to die?
that's not what I meant. It's just
but you wanted to kill her, didn't you, Maya?
stop it. Let me go.
where? Back to your brother?
he hates you.
don't do this. Please!
if you can control your power, no more innocent people have to die.
I can't!
help. You're killing me.
Help...please.
you were right. I did it.
HIRO&ANDO YAMAGATO INDUSTRIES TOKYO, JAPAN My father looked good in a suit. I must find Takezo Kensei.
and avenge my father and any of these Kensei?
no but you're sure he did it?
I saw him on the roof of the Deveaux building just before he pushed my father off you said Kensei died in White Beard's camp even if he didn't...
how could anyone still be alive after 400 years?
Kensei could heal from any wound.
maybe he could survive time as well. You mean he could live forever?
if he did...
he would leave a trail. Searsmont Maine
I don't think we should go in there guns blazing.
let's just tell Victoria the truth.
ask her straight out where to find the virus.
this woman can't be trusted, Peter.
she worked for the company.
she locked me up.
one glance at me on her garden path is liable to affect her mood.
fine.
I'll go alone.
no.
you lost?
hope not.
I'm looking for Victoria Pratt.
never heard of her.
you worked for the company.
in 24 hours, the Shanti virus is released.
a year from now, 93% of the world's population is dead.
how can anyone know what happens a year from now?
I've been there.
I've seen it.
a time traveler.
you created a virus that kills billons of people.
I don't know how it gets out or where, only that it does.
unless you help me.
inside...
now.
ando, be more careful.
you are like...
a hamster making a nest.
Takezo Kensei and my father.
Kensei was calling himself ADAM MONROE.
I saw that name.
from November 2, 1977.
it's a signed order to lock up ADAM MONROE. Signed by my father.
that is it, Ando!
I must go back to this day.
but, Hiro.
you said you would never again travel in time.
that you wouldn't risk changing history.
the memo came from PRIMATECH RESEARCH in Hartsdale, New York.
I must do this.
Hiro
Hiro
not again.
primatech RESEARCH November 1, 1977
containment breach in bio-research.
evacuation protocol in full effect.
you have betrayed everything we stand for.
no, Kaito, I tried to save the world.
by releasing a virus that could kill billons of innocent people?
when you're been around as long as I have, the patterns become clear.
constant war.
disregard for the environment.
famine.
and it's only getting worse.
someone had to make the hard choice for the greater good.
take him down to lockup.
and throw away the key!
are you all right, Victoria?
he was looking for Strain 138.
if he'd been successful, this place would've been ground zero for a global pandemic.
thank you for saving us.
you need to shut down the program, Kaito.
give it to me.
this will be taken to the Primatech facility in Odessa.
with Adam locked away, it will be safe.
look, with something that dangerous, there is no safe.
that virus needs to be destroyed.
the other founders would never allow that.
doesn't that concern you?
Adam had help, Kaito.
it's the only way he would have known what to look for.
I suggest you take a few days off before resuming your work.
I won't be a part of this.
not anymore.
after Kaito and the others were killed,
I figured that sooner or later someone would come after me.
you look like your mother.
I don't know anything about this.
the last time I saw my mother was a year from now, in a future where the world had already been devastated by the Shanti virus.
forgive my paranoia, but I don't know you.
I only knew your parents and what they were capable of.
there was a woman.
Caitlin.
she trusted me to protect her.
now...
somehow I took us into the future, and now I can't get back.
so if you just tell me where to find the virus,
I know that I can save her.
you're looking for a mutated strain.
if it were ever released, it would kill us all.
she told you where to find the virus?
company storage facility in New Mexico.
new Mexico?
company never had a facility
wait, you don't understand.
no, you're working with him now.
that's all I need to know.
I knew blowing your head off was the only way to be sure.
better late than never.
Thanks, Peter.
let's get her up to the house.
I can control my power!
on my own!
it's all thanks to Gabriel.
what did Gabriel do?
he showed me what I am capable of.
isn't...
this wonderful news?
Maya I looked up Gabriel Gray on the computer in the office.
he is a murderer.
the police say he killed his own mother.
no.
I don't believe it.
it's not true.
we need to leave before...
did you tell your brother the good news?
I know what you are!
is something wrong?
this... says you murdered your mother.
but I know you didn't.
you couldn't.
it's true.
I did it.
I killed her.
he admits it?
when my mother found out what I could do, she didn't understand.
she told me I was a monster.
my own mother tried to kill me, Maya.
and as I defended myself, there was an accident.
I understand.
what are you doing, Maya!?
get away from him.
he is a murderer!
I am a murderer!
Gabriel understands exactly what I'm going through...
exactly how I feel.
we are leaving...now!
Alejandro, no!
I'm staying with Gabriel.
we will go see Doctor Suresh without you.
I can control my own ability now.
I am not leaving you alone...with him.
I know you hate me.
I killed the woman you loved.
that wasn't your fault.
yes it was.
in my heart, I wanted her dead.
everything's gonna be okay, Maya.
I'll take care of you.
why did you lie to me, Victoria?
you're with him.
you're helping Adam release the virus.
release the virus?
I'm trying to find the virus so I can destroy it.
30 years ago, Adam broke into my lab.
I stopped him from releasing the virus so he couldn't kill everyone.
and now he's trying to do it again.
I broke into the lab to prevent you and company from putting the world in danger.
you killed Kaito, didn't you?
and the others.
and now it's my turn.
we're trying save lives, Victoria, not take them.
Adam's a killer.
and I guess since you're helping him, you're one too.
just like your parents.
Adam helped me escape the company.
he saved my brother's life.
but what you did, what you were a part of, that will bring an end to the world.
tell me where I can find the virus so I can stop it.
go to hell.
where is it, Victoria?
primatech Paper, Odessa, Texas.
Texas.
No!
thank you.
I am not gonna let you do this!
get away from me!
we're not hurting you.
we're letting you go.
what are you doing?
wait!
you didn't have to kill her.
