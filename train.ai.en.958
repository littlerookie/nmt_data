...Let me see her.
woman, don't
what are you doing?
let me at least hold her once...
...just once...
...at least once
forget it...
...you have disgraced this family!
father, please!
no, father...No!
No!
no Katerina. It's better for her!
it's better for her!
no mother, please...
let her go...let her go, Katerina.
please, Mama...
- Stefan here?
he called, said it was important.
right this way.
Hey. - What is this about?
you.
OK, you have to understand I only know What I've picked up over the years.
and I don't know what's true and what's not true.
that's the problem with all this vampire crap. But Klaus, I know is real.
who is he? - One of the originals. He's a legend.
from of the first generation of vampires. - Like Elijah.
no. Elijah was the easter bunny Compared to Klaus.
he was a foot soldier. Klaus is the real deal.
Klaus is known to be the oldest.
OK, so you're saying that the oldest vampire
in the history of time is coming after me?
Yes. - No.
what they're saying is--I mean, If what she's saying is true... - Which it is.
and you're not just saying it So we don't kill you... - Which I'm not.
then we're looking' at a solid maybe.
look, Elijah's dead, right? So no one else even knows that you exist.
not that you know of. - That's not helping.
look, I've never even met anyone Who's laid eyes on him.
I mean, we're talking Centuries of truth Mixed with fiction.
I mean, we don't know what's real. For all we know, he could just be Some sort of stupid bedtime story.
he's real, and he doesn't give up. If he wants something,
he gets it. If you're not afraid of Klaus, then you're an idiot.
all right, we're shaking. You've made your point.
where you going? - School. I'm late.
let me, uh--let me grab my stuff. I'll go with you.
that's ok. I know where it is.
she's in denial.
shut up, Damon.
here. I got it.
Thanks. - Yeah.
Where's Elena? - She's, um-- she's actually running' late today.
so what are you doing' later? You wanna hang out at the grill, shoot some pool?
winner runs the table.
um, why? - Why what?
well, you never asked me to play a game of pool before, So why now?
uh, I don't know. I thought-- Thought it would be fun.
never mind. - No. Hey, ok.
sure. It's just... - Just what?
it's just you're Elena's brother, and...
sure. It's just I'm really bad at pool.
Yeah. Yeah, I thought you might be. - Excuse me.
do you guys know which way's the office?
uh, yeah. Yeah. Through the double doors,
uh, straight ahead, quick left, -And then your first right.
you must be new here. - Yeah, I am. It's kinda hard To hide it.
my name's Luka. - I'm Jeremy. This is Bonnie.
Hi, Bonnie.
anyway, Luka, I'm, uh-- I'm actually headed In that direction.
why don't you follow me? It could get confusing.
OK, thanks, man. It's nice to meet you, Bonnie.
tell everyone I wasn't feeling well And I went home from school.
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
I'm a terrible liar. And keep Stefan busy. I don't want him knowing what I'm up to.
I'm even worse at duplicity, And you know this.
you managed to keep me occupied When Katherine paid Stefan a visit.
yeah,'cause she threatened me.
not that I'm saying that you should use that as a tactic.
It's--Stefan's gonna see right through me.
Caroline, as my friend, do you promise or not?
you had to break out the girlfriend code.
OK. I promise - Ok.
why don't you want Stefan to know? - Because he would never be ok with me doing this.
are you sure you wanna do this? - Yes, I'm sure.
she's the only one who knows the truth about Klaus,
the only one who can tell me how to stop him.
but you're asking for the truth From someone who's probably never given it.
are you sure about this? - Yes. I can't just sit back and wait.
I have to know, Caroline.
please.
I'll be ok from here.
Hello, Elena.
you come to watch me wither away?
good-bye, Caroline.
as long as I stay on this side of the door, She can't hurt me.
please.
Stefan know you're here? - I brought you some things.
you came to bribe me? What is it that you want?
I want you to tell me about Klaus.
you've been busy.
I also brought you this.
it's your family history.
it says in here that the family line ended with you.
obviously that's not true.
you think that if you brought me some family keepsake, That I'd open up?
I also brought you this.
you don't look so good. How long before your body shuts down?
10, 20 years? Must be painful to desiccate and mummify.
I can't even imagine.
you have the Petrova fire.
more blood?
it's a long story, Klaus and I,
goes all the way back to England, 1492,
after I left Bulgaria.
or was thrown out.
thrown out?
my family, your true ancestors...
they disowned me. My indiscretions were not tolerated at that time.
I had a baby out of wedlock. The shame.
it was kept secret?
my baby was given away.
I was banished to England, And I had to learn to adjust.
it was there that I caught the eye of a nobleman named Klaus.
I was taken with him at first, Until I found out what he was
and what he wanted from me...
and then I ran like hell.
Katerina! I know you're near!
I can smell your blood.
it's pointless to run.
Klaus'll find you wherever you are.
this way. There's more blood over there.
head east. I can't lead them astray much longer.
I can't run anymore. - Another mile.
there's a cottage. You'll be safe there.
go now. Go!
so...
what did Klaus want? - Same thing that he'll want from you.
he wants to break the curse. - By sacrificing the Petrova doppelganger.
he wanted to drain every single drop of blood from my body.
all right, rosebud.
I need some answers.
Oh, please don't tell me you're crying 'cause your buddy Trevor lost his head.
you always been this sensitive? - There's a little vampire switch you can just pfft for this very reason.
takes the emotion out of it. - Yeah, you switch yours, I'll switch mine.
is that a dig? - It's an observation.
being in love With your brother's girlfriend must be difficult.
I'm not in love with anyone. - You wanna try that again?
don't get on my bad side. Then show me your good side.
how do I find Klaus? - You don't find Klaus. He finds you.
come on. Somebody's gotta know somebody Who knows where he is, right?
add another 200 somebodies to that, And you're still not even close.
humor me. You got in touch with Elijah. How'd you do it?
through a very low somebody on the totem pole.
a guy named Slater in Richmond.
perfect. I'll drive.
no. You forget not all of us can do sun.
then you drive. Come on.
Stefan! Hey. - Hey.
um, I need to talk to you. Where are you going?
well, Elena went home sick. I just want to go check up on her.
Ditcher. - I'm kinda worried about her.
you know what? Of course you are. Go ahead.
I--you know what? We can talk later.
uh, talk about what?
I might have done something.
what did you do?
told Tyler I'm a vampire.
what does the Petrova bloodline have to do with Klaus?
it's really tedious, but...
Klaus' curse was bound by the sacrifice of Petrova blood.
witches are crafty with their spells.
the doppelganger was created as way to be able to undo the spell.
once the doppelganger reappeared, The curse can be broken.
so you ran before he killed you.
something like that.
help. Please help me.
please. Help me. - I don't invite strangers into my home.
no. Trevor, he said that you'd help me.
damn him. Always making promises I don't want to keep.
let the girl in.
bring her water and something to eat.
you must be rose. Thank you.
Trevor said to show you this To prove I am who I say, - That you would help me to freedom. - You stole this from Klaus?
it was to be part of the sacrifice ritual, So I--I grabbed it and made my escape.
people do not escape from Klaus.
everyone who tries ends up back in his grasp, And anyone who helps them dies.
I know the risk you bring on yourself by giving me aid. - I am risking nothing.
at nightfall, - I will bring you back to Klaus and beg him to show us both mercy.
No! No!
back entrance. How convenient.
that's the point. We can't all have little daylight rings.
how do you know this Slater guy's even here? - I called him. He's here. He's always here.
good. Just one thing. If you are setting me up in any way,
I will rip your heart out and shove it down your throat.
it's something I'm very good at.
I'm older than you and stronger. Don't get on my bad side.
you can trust me.
what about the, uh... - Double-paned and tempered.
uv rays can't penetrate. - You see the appeal now?
that and the free Wi-Fi.
Hey. How are you? - Hey.
good. I saw you come. What are you doing' here?
Mmm, it's a long story, but I want you to meet
turned 1864, mystic falls, by Katherine pierce,
aka Katerina Petrova.
so I take it I was right.
what I told you about the tomb under the church is true.
Yes. It was right. Thank you for the tip.
it's nice to meet you.
maybe.
what's going' on, rose? Where's, uh, Trevor?
rose never ended up taking you back to Klaus, did she? - No.
but not because she had a change of heart.
it's nightfall. Time to go.
when did this happen? - In the woods. I tripped.
that's a lie. I would have smelled it.
I'd rather die than go back to Klaus. Please just let me die.
if you die, then Trevor dies with you.
no. No!
where is she?
you set us both on a path of death.
I only hope that Klaus sees the honor in returning that girl to him.
he will sacrifice her. - Then so be it!
I love her, rose.
he'll kill you.
he will not stop until he has all of our heads.
then we shall run until we die.
you killed yourself?
Klaus needed a human doppelganger. As a vampire, I was no longer any use to him.
but it didn't work. You didn't really escape.
you've been running from Klaus ever since.
I underestimated his spirit for vengeance.
but living out of a suitcase is better than dying
so that you could have your blood spilled over some silly little rock.
what's wrong? Afraid I'm right?
you don't wanna die? There's another way out.
better hurry. Your opportunity is going,
going, going... And gone.
I made the other choice.
what did you do, Katerina?
I would have helped you live. - You would have helped me run.
that was never going to be enough.
it was enough for me.
do you not see, Trevor?
she used you to help her escape and me to turn her.
Klaus will see our role in this. - And for that, I'm sorry.
as am I... For this.
please understand... - You have just signed our death sentence.
better you die than I.
rose and Trevor spent the last 500 years
running because you used them. Trevor just got killed.
never thought he would have lasted that long.
you don't even care that you ruined their lives.
I was looking out for myself, Elena.
I will always look out for myself.
if you're smart, you'll do the same.
sorry to drag you here, but if I don't eat,
I get those "killing some people" urges.
Tyler totally has those, too, by the way.
Yeah, what else did you say to him? - Not much.
I was trying to keep the questions to a minimum.
are you mad? - Yes, Caroline. As a matter of fact, I am a little mad.
I mean, you put yourself at risk. If Damon finds out
but you're not gonna tell him, are you? - No, of course not. He would kill you.
always looking' out for me. - Yeah. Well, you don't exactly make it very easy on me.
then why do you do it? Why are you such a good friend to me?
I don't know. I guess you, uh
you remind me of someone,
my, uh-- my best friend, Lexi.
I-- You have a friend?
you say that with such a-- A discouraging amount of surprise, Caroline.
no, I just--sorry. I just...
tell me about her.
I will some other time. I gotta go.
wait, no. Um, what do we do about Tyler?
I--I don't want Damon to kill him, 'cause there's a full moon coming up,
and Tyler's totally freaking out about it.
Hey, Bonnie.
Hey. Luka. How was your first day?
it was great. I would like to introduce you to my dad.
Hi. I'm Bonnie Bennett. Dr. Martin. Jonas martin.
it's nice to meet you, Bonnie Bennett.
would you like to join us? Oh, I'm--I'm meeting a friend.
but he's not here yet, so... Sure.
Oh, yes. Please have a seat.
so, um, where'd you move from?
Louisiana. - That's a big change.
I'll say.
it's not so bad here.
it's looking' up. - Bennett, huh?
I knew some Bennetts when I did My residency in Massachusetts.
do you have any family from Salem?
actually, I do.
what do you know? Small world, right?
Oh. There's my friend. It was nice to meet you, dr. Martin.
I'll see you at school. - Yeah.
sorry I was late. You ok? - Yeah.
and you're sure that Elijah's dead?
beyond dead.
Trevor was a good man,
helped me with my dissertation On sexual deviance in the baroque period.
I was going for my psych PhD. - Slater's been in college since '74.
when I was turned. I have 18 degrees--3 master's, and 4 PhDs.
the point?
exactly. I mean, what is the point?
what should I be doing with my eternity? If you have an answer, please enlighten me.
we need your help.
if someone wanted to get in touch with Klaus, How would you hook 'em up?
Craigslist. - Really?
seriously. I respond to a personal ad
that gets sent to somebody who knows somebody
who knows Elijah, who's dead,
and that's where my connection ends.
man, you are bad. - I told you.
all right. Well, feel free to cheat If you need your dignity back. - Come on. Hit the ball.
all right, hey, I got winner, guys. I got winner.
get ready. This slaughter's almost over.
so where's your dad?
um, I'll see him back home.
OK. Now I'm leaving. - Wait. Um...
no, no, no. Caroline, You have 2 seconds to come clean. - What do you mean?
I'd believe the whole innocent act a little bit better
if I didn't know how good you were At providing a distraction on demand.
Where's Elena?
I can't tell you. - You can't tell me? Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry, but I
I can't tell you. - Caroline, Elena was kidnapped, She could have been killed,
and you're seriously not gonna tell me where she is?
she's not in any danger. I would not have let her put herself in danger.
put herself in danger where? What do you
she's with Damon, isn't she? - No.
then where-- where is she?
listen. If you're my friend like you've been pretending to be
all day, then you'll tell me where she is.
Stefan, I am your friend,
but I'm also Elena's friend, and I'm sorry,
but I'm not going to tell you where she is.
so how much of your little story is true?
I have no reason to lie, Elena.
I have no reason to do anything but sit here and read and rot.
OK, so you mean it's even partially true.
that's the reason why you came back, isn't it?
because you wanted to be the one to hand me over to Klaus.
mm, 500 years on the run, I figured maybe he'd be willing to strike a deal.
so you got mason Lockwood to find you the moonstone. - Right again.
what else is needed to break the curse?
Mmm. Look who's getting smarter.
it's not just me or the stone, is it?
otherwise, there would be no reason To trigger Tyler Lockwood werewolf curse.
witches and their spells-- So many ingredients, so many people to sacrifice.
so you need a werewolf.
believe it or not, they're hard to come by.
what else? - A witch to do the spell.
mine bailed, but Bonnie'll do just fine.
what else? - Vampire.
could have been anyone, I suppose,
but I like the poetry of Caroline.
so you were gonna just hand us all over to be killed?
better you die than I.
here's what I don't get. Elijah moves around during the day,
which means the original people Knew the secret of the day ring.
now, why would Klaus want to lift the curse of the sun and the moon?
to keep the werewolves from lifting it.
if a vampire breaks the sun curse,
then the werewolves are stuck With the curse of the moon forever, And vice versa.
but werewolves are all but extinct.
true. I've never seen one, but rumor has it-- - Not such a rumor.
mystic falls?
God, I've got to visit this place. It sounds awesome.
awesome doesn't even begin to describe it.
can we stop the curse from being broken at all? Well, what do you mean?
well, if we rendered the moonstone useless And stopped the curse from being broken.
well, yeah, probably,
but why would you wanna do that?
tell me how.
you think I'm going to help you figure out How to do something that would piss off an original?
and keep me from walking in the sun? You wanna walk in the sun?
I can make that happen, If you help us.
let's go.
you're gonna be ok. - I know. I just
who was behind that? - I don't know. Where's Slater?
iowa by now. Who the hell knows? - He's not behind this. He's a good guy.
he wouldn't betray me. - Then who did it?
it's Klaus. Don't you understand?
you don't know this man. I'm dead. We're all dead.
Hey, Bonnie.
I'm sorry about earlier. My dad, he's not very subtle.
the whole, uh, Bennett, Salem question.
he picked up on you. He was just fishing around.
he didn't mean any harm. - I felt something, too.
I know. That's why we're having this conversation right now.
he, uh...
doesn't like for anyone to know.
but we were both worried that you would nail us.
he just wants us to fit in here For once.
it's tough, Bonnie, being' different.
you're a witch?
well, we prefer the term warlock.
Elena. - Stefan. What are you doing here?
I could ask you the same question. - Caroline told you.
no. She kept your secret, But it didn't take long for me to figure out
what was so important that you'd have to keep it from me.
I knew that you'd stop me. - Listen to me.
whatever she said to you is a lie.
do not listen to her. She is a liar, Elena.
what if she isn't?
you didn't hear what she said. - You don't have to worry.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. That's the problem.
you won't...
but you'll die trying. How is that any better?
there's nothing you can do, Stefan.
I haven't even told you the best part of the story.
bulgaria, 1492
no. No. No, mama.
No! No!
he killed them, My entire family,
just to get back at me for running.
whatever you do to escape Klaus,
on your friends, your family, On anyone that you've ever loved.
no. Look at me. No. Do not listen to her, ok?
always the protector.
but even you must realize that she's doomed.
there's nothing you can do to stop it.
unless of course you have this. - What?
Oh, no. There it is. That's the ultimate lie, isn't it?
you spun this whole thing
so that we would have to get the stone from you, didn't you?
I didn't spin anything, Stefan. It's the truth.
no. Let me guess.
you wanna trade that stone for your freedom.
you manipulative, psychotic bitch.
Heh. My freedom? That's where you're wrong, Stefan.
I don't want my freedom, 'cause when Klaus shows up to kill us all--and he will...
I'll be in the tomb, where no vampire will enter, Because they can't get out.
I'll be the safest psychotic bitch in town.
I'm sorry about today. I didn't know that was gonna happen.
I believe you.
I wish we could save Elena. I know that you want to.
and I will.
you remind me of Trevor.
Why? Why him?
because he always talked a big game,
he was always working an angle,
but underneath it all, he was the best friend Anyone could ever hope for.
hmm. Where'd that get him?
dead.
and my loyalty to him almost got me dead, too.
to friendship.
you're right to fight it...
the way you feel about her.
and why is that?
because if we want to survive,
we need to not care about anyone.
caring gets you dead, huh?
it might just be time to turn the switch off on your emotions.
I will if you will.
I can't talk about it, Stefan. - You have to. Don't shut me out.
Elena, please.
I wanted to know the truth, Stefan, and I got it.
it's not just me that's in danger.
I-it's Caroline, and it's Tyler, and it's Bonnie.
they're all part of breaking the curse.
I can't blame anyone else anymore,
because it's not because you came into town
or because you and I fell in love.
that's not why everyone that I love is in danger.
it's because of me. Everything is because of me.
it's a lie, you know.
there's no switch you can turn off.
sure, when you're a newbie, But after a couple hundred years...
you just have to pretend.
hello. Slater. - Rose?
are you ok? - Yes. I--I took off.
I'm sorry. I was friggin' freaked. - No. I'm sorry to involve you.
look, I want no part in any of this, But I did some digging.
OK. What did you find? - You can destroy the curse, - but you need the moonstone. - How? What do you mean? I don't follow.
well, can your friend get the moonstone? You need it.
Yes. He could get it. What next?
we need a witch. G-get the moonstone.
a witch should be able to figure out the rest.
good luck, rose.
very nicely done.
Thanks. I've a degree in theater.
how can you compel me? A vampire can't compel another vampire.
I'm a special vampire.
what, because you're an original?
now, I want you to take this And drive it through your heart.
but that would k-kill me forever. - I know.
but it's necessary.
was it, really?
it had to be done.
he delivered his message.
won't be long now.
vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them To limit their power.
since then, werewolves Can only turn on a full moon And vampires are weakened by the sun.
Elijah. - One of the originals.
Klaus is the real deal.
you're saying that the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me?
I'm prepared to offer you a deal. - What kind of a deal?
I need you to stay put And stop trying to get yourself killed.
then I shall make certain that your friends remain unharmed.
I called Isobel. - Did you find her?
not exactly.
Hello, Elena. - Uncle John.
bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire.
I'm jules. I know you're a werewolf.
do you know where Mason is? - He's dead, Tyler.
you want to know who murdered him? Your little, blond vampire did.
Caroline would never do that.
she and her little vampire friends were behind it.
Hey.
how's it going? - We need to talk.
Yeah. We do
listen. I've been thinking about it, and I don't want to overanalyze.
it was just one kiss, but Matt is still kind of in the picture.
we can't go there, Tyler.
fine great That's settled.
what happened to my uncle Mason?
what - He's dead, and I want you to tell me what happened.
Tyler - then let me tell you.
Stefan and his brother Damon killed him because Stefan and Damon are vampires, just like you.
who told you that? - Is it true?
let me explain. - Did you know he was dead this whole time?
please - Did you know?
I'm sorry, Tyler. I'm sorry.
I trusted you.
the sheriff's department believes drugs played a part in the assailant's deranged and violent behavior that left 3 people dead at last night's booster club dinner at a local high school.
the authorities believe last night's assailant may also be link to the missing campers and park ranger who have yet to be found as well as 25-year-old jessica konig, reported missing this morning.
breaking NEWS
the sheriff's department says investigations are pending and no further comment will be made.
in related news, mayor Lockwood spoke earlier today.
due to the recent tragedies that have plagued our town,
we will be holding a memorial in town square today to honor all those we have lost.
join us in hopes that as a community, we can begin to heal.
morning. - What are you doing here?
coffee? - We're not doing that.
we did that last night. No more avoiding. Why are you here?
I'm here to protect you. That's all I can say for the moment.
what do you mean, that's all you can say?
I'll tell you more when I'm convinced I can trust you.
Oh, god, I'm late. - That's what you get for hitting the snooze 3 times.
what the hell? - Hey, good morning to you, Jenna. Alaric.
it's ok I'm confused, right? Because we were not expecting you, like, ever.
well, I got in late last night. Elena let me in.
you know, I'm probably just gonna take off.
I'm still confused here.
I decided to come back and stay for a while. - Not here, you're not.
actually, you can't stop me from living here.
actually, I can as legal guardian.
about that, Elena, you want me to explain the situation, - Or would you like to do the honors? - Ok. What's going on?
I'm sorry, jenna. I should've told you earlier, but
I'm elena's biological father.
there. Now you know.
what?
you brought back john gilbert? That was your big save-elena move?
I went to go look for isobel, and I got john instead.
he said he could help us, And we're desperate.
we're not that desperate, stefan. The guy tried to barbeque me.
Damon, bonnie's new witch friend is working with elijah,
so we have to assume that the moonstone was never destroyed.
Elena is putting all of her faith Into some deal that she made With elijah to keep everyone safe.
I mean, do you trust elijah? I don't trust him. He's an original.
he can't be trusted. It's not like we can just go up and kill him
because apparently, he can't die.
still waiting for the part where john gilbert is the answer.
he knew about the sacrifice.
Isobel told him. He said he knew of a way to keep elena safe.
and how do we do that?
he's not talking, at least not to me, anyway.
great work, stefan, top notch. As if I didn't have enough problems.
Hey, I'm sorry about rose.
whatever. I knew the woman for 5 minutes.
and you cared about her after 5 minutes.
Oh, wonder what that means. - It means I care, stefan.
it means I'm changing and evolving into a man Capable of greatness.
you better watch your back
because I may just have to go get a hero hairdo of my own And steal your thunder.
911 NOW
I got it, mom.
what's wrong? - Tyler knows about you and damon.
he knows that damon killed mason. I didn't say a word.
it's that woman jules. She had a run-in with damon.
Tyler was so upset. The look on his face, he was so betrayed.
wow, this is bad. - You're not gonna tell damon, are you?
no. We hear that he wants to kill him. He thinks all werewolves should die,
and he's not wrong to think that, caroline. I mean, what if tyler tries to retaliate?
he has every right to. He can get himself killed.
Yeah. We have to get to him and reason with him
before he does something stupid.
you have to talk to him.
just try to explain, you know? You always know the right things to say, ok?
he and I... We're friends.
I was right, wasn't I?
your little vampire friend, she was lying.
what do you want?
I want you to understand that a vampire Will never be your friend.
it's our nature to be enemies.
you know how stupid that sounds?
you need to leave here. It's not safe.
I can't just run away with you. I don't even know you.
my mom would freak.
my life is here. - Your old life.
your new life is just beginning.
you have so much to learn. - Like what?
how to survive.
you've triggered the curse, tyler.
it's important you learn what it means to be a lycanthrope.
we live by a code of loyalty. We take care of each other.
it's my duty and honor to help you. Please let me.
Where's john? - He's not here.
he left. I don't know where he went.
he just blew in, announced to jenna That he's my dad, and then took off.
it's public knowledge now? - Apparently.
you ok? - Yeah.
Jenna's head is spinning, but I'm ok.
he say what he was doing here? - No.
you know, stefan thinks that he's telling the truth About wanting to help me.
you believe him? - No. I don't believe him for a second.
I don't, either.
want are we gonna do? - Kill him.
Damon - I'm joking.
OK. I'm a little serious.
Damon! - I'm not gonna hurt him, elena.
I'm the good guy now, remember?
what does that mean? - I'm gonna have a civil conversation with your father.
wait. I'm coming with you.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just want to talk.
then why did you break in? - Would you have let me in otherwise?
not a word. - Tyler, - This is a hard place to find. - You told me to stay under the radar.
thanks for coming. - You sure these vamps killed mason?
positive. We have to be careful.
I'm not afraid of a vampire.
I know, baby, but I want the boy More than I want vengeance.
I say, let's get both.
maybe we're getting off on the wrong foot here.
what happened to mason?
Tyler, there's a lot for us to talk about.
I wouldn't do that. Without a full moon, you're no match for me.
it's good to have you back, john. We could really use you.
and the council? What are they doing?
Damon salvatore is leading the council now.
talk
excuse
Jeremy, there you are.
looks like I slept through the homecoming.
you didn't miss much.
to say that no one is happy to see me would be an understatement.
things are different now.
you can't come around and start up with all this antivampire stuff.
I have no intention of doing that.
how's that ring been treating you?
look. If this is what you came for, Just take it and go.
what kind of man would I be if I took that from you?
want to go grab some lunch? - Think I'll pass.
all right.
Hello, bonnie.
I don't have anything to say to you, dr. Martin,
or your son.
you must be feeling very confused about us.
nothing confusing about it.
I trusted luka, and he betrayed me.
Elena told me you're both working for elijah,
so don't lie about it.
I won't, but that doesn't mean We're not also looking out for you.
spare me the witch loyalty crap.
you might not want to believe this, But elijah is a man of his word.
you can trust that he'll keep his end of the deal With Elena to keep you and your friends protected.
you're right. I don't believe it.
is there a problem here?
not at all.
what was that about? - More lies.
I can't believe it.
Elena is my sister's husband's brother's daughter,
and her mother is my boyfriend's deceased wife.
you can't make this stuff up.
it's definitely a little overwhelming.
I can't believe that they kept it a secret.
how it is even possible to keep a secret like that?
Hey, you two.
you think I can join you?
do you have to? - I guess I don't have to, but might as well.
look who's here.
we just need answers. Please don't do anything stupid.
Yeah, but stupid is so much more fun.
Damon, I mean it. All I'm asking is you try to keep it together.
be the better man.
OK, then.
John, buddy - How you been? - I've been all right, damon.
it's good to see you.
look. About caroline, no matter what her flaws are,
when push comes to shove, you're gonna want that girl on your side.
she's your friend. Stop being a dick to her.
I thought vampires hated werewolves.
that's some sort of leftover idea from another time.
doesn't have to be that way anymore. We go to the same school.
we have the same friends. We keep the same secrets. This can work, tyler.
I mean, it's your home. It's my home, too. I want this to work.
help. Help.
whose number was that, hmm?
damn it, tyler. I'm trying to save your life. Can't you see that?
we have a problem.
so, john, rumor has it, You know a lot and won't say anything.
how do I know you can be trusted, damon?
originals can compel vampires, according to stefan.
that's why katherine is still in the tomb,
because an original has compelled her to stay there.
only because all of the vervain had left her system.
Stefan and I, on the other hand, Are chock full.
you guys are drinking vervain?
it's an acquired taste.
I don't see that magical ring on your stitched finger,
so if you know something about klaus, you better start talking,
or I will kill you in your sleep.
now, is that any way to convince me That you and I are on the same side?
first, I need to know that I can trust you, damon,
that I can count on you.
then we'll talk.
Hey.
Hey.
I haven't seen you.
I'm not avoiding you, I swear.
Yeah. You're avoiding me a little.
OK, maybe a little.
can we talk later? I mean, I'm headed to work right now, but maybe after,
clear up some of this weirdness?
Yeah. Yeah. I'd really like that.
I'll just swing by when you're closing. - Sounds good.
OK. Bye.
excuse me.
Caroline, right? - Yeah.
I'm looking for tyler. You haven't seen him, have you?
no, not since earlier. Sorry.
I know you're lying.
Really? How?
is that one of your little wolf tricks?
actually, it is.
well, I have a trick, too.
I see you got the bullet out.
that was nasty.
I got lots of wooden bullets,
other toys.
it's gonna be a long night, sweet pea.
you want to be friends, great. We're friends.
will you go now? - I don't know what else to say to you, tyler.
I came back to this town because I wanted a life.
I wanted to exist where I could have friends And where I could build a family.
I have that here. We can both have that.
Hi. Everything ok?
that depends. How badly do you want to keep her alive?
who is this? - Ask your brother. Where's tyler?
Where's caroline? - You made a mistake, stefan.
I'm gonna give you a chance to fix it. - Where is she?
right here. Want proof?
he needs proof.
what's happening? - Hurt her again, and you're dead.
I hurt her again, and she's dead. Bring tyler to me, clearing by wickery falls.
you have 20 minutes until she dies.
so my friend wants to meet you.
Damon salvatore, this is -I know you - - the news lady.
Yeah, andie star. Nice to meet you.
can I buy you a drink, damon?
my glass is all full, andie. Thank you.
you totally blew her off.
I'm steering clear of all women at the moment.
you didn't have to be rude. - Trust me, it's in the best interest of women everywhere.
what is it?
why am I just finding out about this now?
Stefan was worried that you- - That I would what, what I would kill him?
of course. That's what needs to happen.
no, damon, not tyler. Do whatever you need to do to get caroline back,
but just leave tyler out of it, ok?
Why? He's a werewolf. He needs to die.
I'm willing to kill. It's a win-win.
Damon, please, ok? Too many people are dead.
you need to stop doing that.
doing what?
assuming that I'll play the good guy Because it's you who's asking.
be the better man, damon.
do you mind? - What's going on?
nothing. - Doesn't look like nothing.
well, guess what, john. Trust works both ways. Get out.
look. We don't have time for this. We need to get caroline back.
we don't need to do anything. I'll take care of it.
first dad duty-- ground your daughter. Keep her here.
no, no, no, no. I'm with damon on this one. Stop, stop.
you're not going anywhere. Just tell me what's going on.
so...
how many vampires are there in this town anyway?
no? - Why are you doing this to me?
why are you doing this to me? Why?
you're a vampire.
why not?
I'm sorry. What was that?
get me out! - Excuse me?
what was that?
let me out!
get it out of your system? - No.
I'm just getting started. - Brady, let's be smart about this.
I just want the boy. It's our duty to help him. It's who we are.
you want to talk duty and honor? These are vampires.
they cross one of us, they cross all of us.
that's who we are.
you're not leaving this restaurant. You can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can. Want to know why? Because I'm here to make sure you stay safe.
I've got that covered.
are you talking about the deal That you made with elijah?
you really think he's gonna keep his promise to you?
putting your faith in him was a dumb move.
are you saying I should put my faith in you?
after everything that you did to stefan and damon?
we've had our differences, And I've made mistakes,
but you and I, we're family.
you don't get to use that word.
that word is off limits to you.
fine, but it doesn't change the facts.
you're right. Facts are facts, so listen up.
you may be my father, but I am never going to be your daughter. You got that?
I know you're out there.
Where's caroline?
locked up tight.
let her go and I'll release tyler.
it doesn't have to get any messier Than it already has.
I'm not your enemy, jules.
it's a little late to be waving a white flag, don't you think?
you need to leave town.
no one else has to get hurt.
I'm not leaving without tyler.
Tyler's free to make his own decisions.
as soon as you release caroline.
my brother the peacemaker.
since stefan got here before me, I'm gonna let him try it his way
before I resort to my way, Which is a little bloodier.
so give us caroline. - Let go of tyler.
give us caroline. Light of full moon. It's not an even fight and you know it.
we'll take you.
I'm not so sure about that, tough guy.
let's try this again.
give us tyler.
you heard her. Go.
which one of you killed mason?
uh, that'd be me.
boys, make sure that one suffers.
we can take them. - I don't know about that.
well, then
Tyler! There's a latch. There's a latch on the door and I can't get to it.
Tyler, please. Tyler?
what's happening?
what the hell's going on?
Elijah made a promise to elena.
I'm here to see it's upheld.
you need to go.
get out of here. Now.
when your friends awaken, give them a message.
they need to get the hell out of this town.
so is your mom home? - No.
I can come in if you want me to. - I'm fine, stefan.
you don't have to pretend with me.
anybody would be upset after What you went through tonight.
I'm ok.
I'm not girlie, little caroline anymore.
I can handle myself.
you sure can.
I just really want to go shower, so
OK.
good night. - Good night.
what do you want? - We didn't finish our conversation.
I'll bite.
I've been thinking. Personal feelings aside, damon,
I think you and stefan Will do all you can to protect elena.
I agree with that statement.
so I come bearing gifts.
what the hell is that?
this is how you kill an original.
in this vial is ash from a white oak tree That dates back to the genesis of the originals.
the dagger must be dipped into the ash
and then plunged into their heart.
how do you know all this, john?
Isobel. She's very good at finding out things.
but of course you know that. - Where is isobel?
let's just say if she accomplishes what she's attempting,
Klaus will never set foot in mystic falls.
where elena's concerned, You and I are on the same side.
Hi. - Hey. Did something happen?
Oh, my--I am so sorry, matt.
are you ok? - Yeah.
something came up with bonnie And she needed me.
a friend thing.
you understand? - Yeah.
so you with her right now? - Yeah.
so I'm not gonna make it tonight, But can I see you tomorrow?
Yeah. Sure. I hope everything works out.
good night. - Good night.
are you ok?
I'm fine.
I had no idea they would come for you.
do you know what they did to me?
I'm sorry.
but it's crazy now. Ok?
I don't know who to trust. You lied to me.
I lied to protect my friends. I lied to protect you.
don't you get that?
Caroline - you just stood there When they were going to kill us.
you just stood there. You didn't do anything.
I didn't know what to do. - You help your friend. That's what you do.
I'm sorry. - No, it's too late.
because we're not friends anymore. And what happened to me tonight,
that will never happen again. So you take that back to your little werewolf pack
and you get the hell out of my house.
I'm sorry about earlier. - Enough already.
I don't want you here And I can't make that any more clear.
I didn't come here to fight with you, elena.
Yeah, I know. You're here to protect me.
got it. Get in line.
I thought you might want this.
it was your mother's.
Isobel? No.
your mother. Miranda.
I remember her wearing it when she was young.
I found it in a box with some things that your dad left me.
here. It's yours now.
Miranda and grayson were your parents, elena.
I know I'm nothing to you.
you have no reason to believe me or trust me.
I've done so many horrible things.
but when you lost your parents
I lost my brother, my family.
I lost my way.
I know I'm probably never going to make things right with you.
I know that, but
I'm gonna do everything I can to protect you
and protect this family.
are you ok?
I'm fine. - Did you hear that?
I don't believe him, stefan.
I just don't.
what happened tonight? How's caroline?
I could use your help.
Hey. Come on in.
I'm sorry about your friends.
it's not always like this.
is it? - No.
is it, brady? - No, man.
you're living in vampire country, that's all.
it's way better than this.
Mason didn't tell me anything about it. He was gone.
dead, I guess, Before he could help me.
I don't get what mason was even doing here In the first place.
his brother died. You know that, brady
why was he stupid enough to stay And get himself killed?
because of this rock he was trying to find.
what rock? - A moonstone.
I had no idea. - What?
moonstone?
did he find it? - Yeah.
where is it now?
I couldn't tell you.
what's going on? - I was a bit worried about you.
after everything you went through tonight. - I'm fine.
good. But just in case, I
brought some backup.
we're gonna slumber it.
we haven't done it in ages.
I love you.
I love you.
I can't believe you called me.
I thought I was being way too forward When I had jenna give you my number.
I like a woman who knows what she wants.
thank you.
so what do you want, Mr. Tall, dark, and handsome?
I'm not that tall.
I need a distraction.
you can booty call me anytime you want.
see, the thing is, miss sexy reporter girl,
I have a problem I need help with. It's really messing with my mind.
tell me about it.
I'm in love with a woman I can never have.
I knew it.
I know how to pick them.
so why can't you have her?
she's with another man, I assume?
Yeah, that's not the point. The point is I'm in love with her
and it's driving me crazy. I'm not in control.
you don't trust yourself around her? - I don't trust myself around anyone, andie.
I'm bad, andie. I do things.
I kill people.
don't be afraid.
you're ok.
why do you kill people?
because I like it.
it's in my nature. It's who I am.
but then I have to stay together to protect her And she wants me to be the better man,
which means I can't be who I am.
do you see the problem I'm having, andie?
well, maybe this is who you are now.
love does that, damon. It changes us.
just stop talking.
just kiss me. Be my distraction.
I know you're expecting someone else.
I sent stefan to find isobel.
she got your message.
she was busy, So she sent me instead.
does stefan know that you're here right now?
no. No one does.
this is between you, me, and isobel.
I want out of this tomb, john.
I'm already on it.
vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
since then, werewolves can only turn on a full moon, and vampires are weakened by the sun.
you're saying that the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me?
Klaus is the most feared and hated of the originals, but I'm here, and I'm prepared to offer you deal.
do you trust Elijah?
he's an original. He can't be trusted.
Elena told me you're both working for Elijah, so don't lie about it.
I'm Jules.
I know you're a werewolf.
do you know where Mason is?
he's dead, Tyler.
I don't know who to trust.
you just stood there! When they were going to kill us, you just stood there! You didn't do anything!
I didn't know what to do.
it's too late because we're not friends anymore.
thanks for coming.
I'm not afraid of a vampire.
we will take you.
I'm not so sure about that, tough guy.
Elijah made a promise to Elena.
I'm here to see it's upheld.
I don't know what Mason was doing here in the first place.
because of this rock he was trying to find.
what rock? - A moonstone.
where is it now?
I couldn't tell you.
go ahead. Tell her.
let me just preface this with a big disclaimer that screams, "I should have known better.
what is it, Stevie?
when Brady told me what that Tyler kid said about Mason being here for the moonstone, something clicked.
there was this moment back in Florida when I suspected Mason was up to something because he was banging that hot vampire chick Kathy and he didn't want anyone to know.
all right. Just get to the point, Stevie.
that is the point, Jules.
it's the sun and moon curse.
Mason was asking me all kinds of questions about it, if it could be broken, and when that evil man-witch showed up last night, double-click, which is vampires, moonstone.
they're putting everything in place to break the curse.
we can't let them do that, even if we have to kill every last vampire in this town.
go away.
hello.
Elena!
how was the slumber party?
good. Heh. Much needed.
when can you and I have one?
that can be arranged.
OK.
now. Today.
take me far, far away.
even with everything that's going on?
because of everything that's going on.
and you're sure this has nothing to do with dodging your father who just got into town?
uh, this has everything to do with that.
well, in that case, where would you like to go?
I'm late.
this is such a crazy day.
I'm, uh, covering the historical society's high tea.
Ooh! Thrilling.
Yeah. It's for some visiting writer.
he's writing a book on small-town Virginia.
it's a big snooze.
writer? What's his name?
uh, Elijah Smith.
Smith. He's using Smith?
OK. You have your story straight in your mind, right?
I can't say that you bit me or drank my blood, just that we hit it off and I really like you.
you are terrific, though.
you're sweet, funny, you're honest.
and you're falling hard.
you might be the one.
perfect.
have a great day, honey.
Oh. Hey, Alaric.
later.
my new girlfriend
Andie Star, action news.
it's not called action news.
I know. I just like saying it. Come on.
so John Gilbert gave me this to kill Elijah.
said you have to dip the dagger in the remains of an old white ash tree that dates back to the originals, if there's any truth in that.
so you think it's a setup?
it could be. Guy's a weasel.
wouldn't put anything past him.
what are you up to today, Mr. Saltzman?
well, Jenna and I were supposed to go to her family's lake house, but somehow, we both got roped into doing this historical society thing at the Lockwoods.
where Elijah's the guest of honor.
tell me you're not gonna kill him at the tea party.
no. That would be stupid.
I want to know his endgame before I kill him, but I do think it's time Elijah and I officially met.
OK. So tell me about this big witchy plan you've been cooking up.
we still don't know the extent of what Elijah's up to.
no, we don't.
so I'm gonna ask Luka to tell me what he knows.
and he's not gonna tell you anything.
I didn't say he was gonna have a choice.
what?
what's that about?
uh, I don't know. I thought that we were...
I don't know.
Tyler, hi.
you're still here.
is that all right with you?
that guy last night made it pretty clear you needed to go.
and we will soon.
listen. We kind of need your help with something.
we need you to help us find the moonstone.
somebody needs to explain to me what the big deal is about a rock.
that rock helps break the curse of the sun and the moon.
I don't know what that means.
it's an old curse placed on both vampires and werewolves.
vampires break the curse, they're free to walk in the sunlight, but we're stuck only turning at the full moon, aka werewolf armageddon.
but if we break it, they're stuck as night-walkers, and we can turn whenever we want.
aka werewolf domination.
Tyler, if we can turn at will, that means we never have to turn at all, not if we don't want to.
I'd never have to turn again?
there's more. Stevie.
if those vamps are gearing up to break the curse, they must have also found the doppelganger.
the doppelganger?
evil twin shadow person.
we're betting Mason's hot vampire chick
Kathy knows all about it, so we need you to help us find Kathy.
I have a... a picture.
Mason brought her to the bar once.
no one liked her. She was a vampire.
bad news.
right... right here. The girl next to Mason.
that's Elena Gilbert.
you know her?
I've known her my whole life.
I'm... I'm working.
Yeah, ok. I can see that, but can you work and talk?
what do you want, Caroline?
uh, I want to talk about what we were supposed to talk about last night before I had to cancel on you.
I want us to clear up the weirdness.
I just want us to talk about us.
now you're just making it worse.
uh, I... I don't know what's going on, Matt.
where were you last night when you were supposed to be with me?
I... - And don't say you were with Bonnie because Bonnie was here, Caroline.
I saw her.
Yeah.
Matt!
Caroline.
you stay away from me.
it's important.
just stop it, Tyler, ok?
you're just... you're just making it worse.
please, Caroline.
I'm sorry about what happened, ok, but there's so much we need to talk about.
I said just leave me alone.
the two of you want to get together, fine.
there's nothing I can do about it, but do me a favor, and both of you stop lying about it.
Matt, there's nothing going on.
Hey! I said stop lying.
are you ready for our romantic weekend?
beyond ready.
let's go before John shows up and pretends to be a concerned father.
Mmm. I'll go put these in the car.
need to talk. Where are you?
uh, please tell me there's nothing wrong.
all good, never mind. Have fun.
nothing's wrong. Just Caroline.
come on. Let's go.
she's going to Dunham lake.
her family has a house up there.
nice. Let's go get our doppelganger.
you all right?
I'm good. I just haven't been back here since before.
Oh, my god.
Elena, listen. Just say the word, all right?
we'll get back on that highway, we'll go anywhere else.
I've always loved it here.
I want it to stay that way, I was just...
having a moment.
OK.
you don't have to wait out there. I'm all good.
Oh, that's great because I'm, uh...
I'm stuck.
Oh, my god. You can't get in.
not gonna be a very romantic weekend unless you, uh, invite me inside.
Stefan, I can't. - What?
my parent's left this place to John Gilbert.
he's the only one who can invite you in.
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
you're kidding me, right?
Stefan salvatore, I hereby invite you into this home.
you are such a liar.
Hey, hey, hey!
have you spent much time in Richmond for your book?
there's such a wealth of history there.
no. I'm focusing mostly on the smaller regions of Virginia.
lots of research. Strictly academic.
that's fascinating.
Damon, what are you doing here?
Hi. You came.
Hi. - Hi.
thanks for introducing us, Jenna.
Damon. - Carol.
what a surprise. - Hi.
Hi. Elijah,
I want you to meet Damon Salvatore.
his family is one of Mystic Falls' founding families.
such a pleasure to meet you.
no. Pleasure's mine.
come bearing coffee gifts.
so you're talking to me now.
I found out what your dad did, saving my friends from the wolf pack.
well, had I known that's all it took...
Hey. How's it going?
what are you doing here?
Bonnie called. I wanted to help.
how's it going?
she's selling it, and he's buying it.
she's giving him the sex smile.
all right, Caroline. I get it.
what do you say? You want to play a game?
Yeah. - Yeah?
Yeah.
what's happening to me?
you'll be ok.
Ooh. Ooh! Why don't we go over here?
I got him, I got him.
what kind of witch roofie was that?
strong one.
having another moment?
Jeremy broke his arm diving off this dock when he was 6.
my dad taught me how to fish right off the edge up there.
so many memories.
do you ever think about us, what our future will be like, our memories?
I think there are long conversations to be head about our future, about the kind of life we could have together.
now there's a box that we shouldn't open.
Oh, we can open it.
whenever you're ready.
no. I'd rather just be here...Now.
you know, this is a future memory.
it's where your boyfriend whispered to you that he loved you.
I love you.
what's Damon doing with Elijah?
how would I know?
because you're his little helper.
if you say so, John.
does Jenna know about your extracurricular activities?
maybe it's time we tell her.
I mean, she can't stay in the dark forever.
you're a dick.
I don't think you should sleep over anymore.
it's inappropriate with children in the house,
and that ring that Isobel gave you, that's mine.
I'm gonna want that back.
what can I do for you, Damon?
I was hoping we could have a word.
Where's Elena?
safe with Stefan.
they're laying low, you know.
bit of a werewolf problem.
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
I'm sure you did since it was your witch that saved the day.
you are welcome.
which adds to my confusion on exactly why you're here.
why don't you just stay focused on keeping Elena safe and leave the rest to me.
not good enough.
you young vampires, so arrogant.
how dare you come in here and challenge me?
you can't kill me, man.
it's not part of the deal.
silence.
I'm an original.
show a little respect.
the moment you cease to be of use to me, you're dead, so you should do what I say.
keep Elena safe.
my dad did all the cooking, too.
and your mom?
she sat right here and watched.
she couldn't cook either.
fire's dying.
Oh, yeah. I'll go get more wood.
I got it.
no, no. It's cold outside.
so I'll get a jacket.
my mom's perfume.
Jenna was supposed to pack all this up, but...
she kept putting it off.
I don't blame her.
here.
bundle up.
it was my great granddad's.
and you look very hot in it.
I look hot in your dead great granddad's jacket?
beyond hot.
Stefan! It's my parents' bedroom.
what?
what?
this is hollow inside.
what is it?
it's a really good hiding place.
Oh, my god.
we only have, like, an hour or two before my mom gets home, and these are all I could find.
place these evenly around the room.
how does this work?
um, I'll put him in a trance and ask him questions.
it's like hypnosis.
you sure you're strong enough for this?
that's what the candles are for.
I'll draw power from the flames.
I'll get the matches.
I got it.
never gonna get used to that.
Oh, come on. That's pretty hot, and you know it.
I need a bowl of water.
Yeah, yeah. I'll go get it.
OK. What was that? "It's hot"?
he is so crushing on you.
so? - So...
what, you'd rather be with traitor warlock over here?
I'm not into Luka.
it's just, you know, he understood me, and he was new and different.
and you've known Jeremy since forever, and you only see him one way, as Elena's brother, but you're a witch, and I'm a vampire.
you know, it's not like we're in any position... - To be picky.
no.
to judge.
looks like he's waking up.
today was a bust.
Yeah. How's the throat?
sore.
Yeah. That Elijah's one scary dude but with nice hair.
Hey. You want another one?
he's gonna be hard to kill.
Yeah. I'd think twice before I'd trust that dagger and some ashes to do the job, you're gonna need more info.
I'm out of sources.
what's up with you and this news chick?
she's got spunk, huh?
just don't kill her, please.
if I did, who would report her death?
just don't do it, all right?
she's friends with Jenna, and it's bad enough that I'm lying to her about everything else.
I hate the lies.
Oh, god. I got to go.
I got to pick Jenna up.
don't worry. I'll, uh, show myself out.
good luck.
Whew! Damn, you're strong.
it took the whole syringe.
grab that one. He's dead.
Hi, Damon.
nice to see you again.
these must be the other Jonathan Gilbert journals.
Jeremy had the one, but John said that there were others.
his whole life's in here.
I'll go get the firewood.
I'll let you have a moment.
we're good to go.
you up for this?
these people have done nothing but lie to you.
this girl that you've known since birth, she's with the vampires now, the ones who killed Mason.
they're the enemy, and if they break that curse, well...
all of us are as good as dead.
are you up for this?
Yes.
good.
because if you wuss out, you're gonna have me to deal with, you got it?
Where's Elena?
at the lake house for the weekend.
with Stefan?
Yes, with Stefan.
and who gave her permission for that?
I did. Until you get a lawyer, file for guardianship, it's my call, and there's nothing you can do about it.
I always knew you were lax with them, but I didn't think you were negligent.
she wanted to get away from you, OK?
and so do I, so I'll be staying with Rick.
because he's such a great guy, right?
you are on dangerous ground.
he's a liar, Jenna.
what? - Did he ever tell you what happened to his wife?
she died. - Really?
so they found her body?
what are you saying?
why don't you ask Rick?
I'd love to hear his answer.
have a great night.
morning, sunshine.
I saw this movie once, some torture porn flick.
anyway, they had this collar device that was really cool, so I just modified it some with some wooden nails, and when I pull...
so I hear you have the moonstone.
Oh, if you only knew the irony of this moment right now.
let me tell you how this is gonna go.
you're gonna torture me, I don't talk, someone loses a heart.
last time, it was your boy Mason.
this time, it will be you.
how long is this gonna take?
I don't know. He's fighting me.
please stop. Please.
Yeah. All right.
why are you working with Elijah?
Klaus.
we both want him dead.
you want to kill Klaus, too. Why?
because he has her, and we have to get her away from him.
who... who are you talking about?
my sister.
sister?
why does he have her?
he's searching for a way to undo the curse without the doppelgger.
he's forced generations of witches to help him for centuries.
what has Elijah promised you?
if we help Elijah kill Klaus,
he's promised to return her to us.
and how do you kill Klaus?
how do you kill an original vampire?
he'll kill me if I tell you.
don't make me.
it's OK, Bonnie.
we can find another way.
no.
how will you kill Klaus?
after the sacrifice, Klaus will be vulnerable, weak.
it's our only chance.
after the sacrifice?
what do you mean, after?
Klaus will be vulnerable.
but Elena will be dead.
Yes.
Elena has to die.
no.
keep him down.
if he moves...
kill him.
don't move!
just let me get the bullet out.
it punctured my heart.
I need to get it out. I'm not gonna fight you.
I don't think so.
Tyler, why are you doing this?
I can't let you break the curse.
you know about the curse?
you're liars, all of you.
no. I swear to you.
we don't want to break the curse, Tyler.
we don't want to do that.
Oh, yeah?
but I do.
I can't be like this forever.
Tyler, I'm just trying to save Elena.
Elena will be fine!
they didn't tell you that part, did they?
who are the liars now?
tell me what?
in order to break the curse,
Elena has to die.
are you growing the trees out there?
Stefan?
Stefan, what are you doing out there?
I can smell you.
it's OK. It's OK. You're OK.
you're OK.
you're OK. It's OK.
Tyler?
I didn't know what they were gonna do to you.
I didn't.
I just...
I didn't want to be like this anymore.
I'm sorry, Elena.
it's OK.
you know what the great thing about buckshot is?
it scatters through the body, maximum damage.
Where's the moonstone?
get over it, honey.
you're never gonna get it.
you looking for this?
go ahead. Take it.
what about you, sweetheart, hmm?
you want to take a shot?
no? Yes? No?
Where's the girl?
I don't know.
it doesn't really matter.
so you realize this is the third time I've saved your life now?
so he planned to kill her all along.
Yeah. The sacrifice is part of Elijah's plan.
got it loud and clear.
finally.
you missed all the fun.
there you are. Are you OK?
Yeah, sorry. I... I...
I've just been grading papers.
honestly, uh...
I fell asleep. I'm sorry.
Jenna, I'm a jerk.
no. It's fine. I'm just glad you're OK.
sorry. Tomorrow I'm all yours, OK?
sure. Sounds great.
all right. Good night, Jenna.
good night.
it was straight from the witch's mouth.
he was gonna go through with the whole sacrifice.
you should probably just keep her away a little longer.
be careful. Try not to get yourself killed.
Yeah. It's been a day for that.
that was, um... that was Damon.
we need to talk.
what is it?
he learned that Elijah's planning for you to die in the sacrifice ritual.
I know the deal I made, Stefan.
Elijah's very careful with his words.
he promised to protect my friends.
he never said a word about me.
you mean, you knew that you weren't gonna survive this?
if it comes down to the people that I love getting killed or me,
I know what my choice is gonna be.
Elena, how... how could you stand out there earlier with me, talking about making plans for our future when you don't even expect to have one.
I'm sorry, Stefan.
I'm just trying to keep the people that I love safe.
I'm trying to keep you safe.
no. What you're doing is you're being a martyr.
how is that any different from when you say that you would die to keep me safe?
because I've already lived.
162 years I have lived, and you've barely begun, and now you want to let yourself get killed?
that's not heroic. It's tragic.
so will Luka remember anything?
no.
he'll know he lost consciousness, that's all.
should we wait for Caroline?
she was just gonna drop Luka back at the Grill.
said to lock the door on our way out.
Yeah. Well, I hope she drops him hard.
wait.
you're 's little brother,
I've known you forever.
you're that punk kid.
I remember your awkward phase and then your emo phase, your druggie phase, and overnight, you turned into this hot guy who's really sweet and...
you think I'm hot?
with everything that's going on, you know, curses and sacrifice...
enough already.
Hello?
Hello?
Matt.
I'm not in the mood, man.
I need to say something.
all right. Say it.
I've been going through a rough time, something I can't really talk about, and Caroline's been helping me through it.
she's been there for me more than anyone's ever been there my entire life, and I kind of fell for her.
I don't know how anyone wouldn't because she's pretty incredible.
but she loves you, and she needs you, and to be honest, she deserves someone like you.
so you be good to her, OK?
Yeah, man. Of course.
see you around, Matt.
Yeah.
mom?
I'm sorry about Brady and your friends, but if I'm gonna go with you, no more lies.
no more lies.
you're doing the right thing.
I can't stay here, not like this.
you must be Elena. - How do we look exactly alike?
you are a part of a doppelganger. You're the key to breaking the curse.
is that the blue curse? - The Curse is the real deal.
from the first generation of vampires.
the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me?
one of the originals. - He's a legend.
I'm prepared to offer you a deal. - What kind of a deal?
you and I shall drop out and I shall make certain your friends remain unharmed.
and then what? - Then I kill him.
take me far, far away. - Where would you like to go?
these must be the other Jonathon Gilbert journals.
I come bearing gifts. This is how you kill an original.
that ring Isobel gave you. That's mine. I'm gonna want that back.
did he ever tell you what happened to his wife?
what are you saying? - Why don't you ask Rick?
how will you kill Klaus? - After the sacrifice.
after the sacrifice? - Elena has to die.
you knew that you weren't going to survive this?
if it comes down to the people that I love getting killed and me,
I know what my choice is going to be.
you're being a martyr. That's not heroic. It's tragic.
with the dying embers of the fire at Fell's church, the scourge of the vampires had passed.
and though war raged all around us,
our town was safe from the demons of the night...
or so we thought.
for the monsters we drove to their fiery deaths had begat new monsters.
did you hear that?
stay here. - No, Thomas.
it's all right, dear, the vampires are all dead.
Yes, Honoria, they burned in the church. We're safe now.
please, Jonathon. I'm worried.
very well. I shall go, too.
I can prove there are no vampires.
see.
Thomas! - No, stay inside! Get back in the house!
No!
I knew I was about to die.
you cannot run from a vampire.
I saw the vampire who killed me.
I recognized him.
what's going on? - Well, I showered. I shaved.
had breakfast. Very relaxed. - That makes one of us.
I did hear one piece of good news though.
Tyler Lockwood ran away from home last night.
how do you know?
well, I heard it from sheriff Forbes,
who heard it from a very distraught Carol Lockwood,
thus, ending our werewolf chapter, bringing us to...
killing Elijah. - Exactly.
well, it's not going to be easy. He's crafty.
well, I've got a crafty little dagger.
he's an original. We don't know what all that encompasses.
wow, Damon, tell me you're actually gonna be careful for once.
Yes, Stefan, I've become you. How tragic for both of us.
got to run. I've a murder to plan. Busy day.
the old fell property actually starts just beyond that Fell.
Ah, the Fells. One of the "founding families."
why do you say it like that?
my research showed me that this area was actually settled
almost two full centuries earlier.
it was a migration of townsfolk from the northeast,
um, it was Salem, to be precise.
Massachusetts? As in the witch trials?
which means the ever lauded founding families...
they didn't actually found anything.
well, I bet it was the men who made a big deal about being founders back in 1860.
men are very territorial.
Yes, they are.
Elijah, this is my friend, Alaric Saltzman.
Yeah, I got your message about walking Elijah here through the old property lines.
I thought I would tag along.
you know being a history buff and all.
where to next?
I'm pretty curious about the freed slave property owners.
some say, you know, the descendents of the slaves are the true keepers of American history.
well, I only brought the surveys. I got the list in the car just give me a sec.
so you're one of those people on Elena's list of loved ones to protect.
so is Jenna. - You don't have to be jealous.
I don't really pursue younger women.
it's a joke, Ric, lighten up. - Right.
Hey, what are you doing?
thinking about last night. - Yeah, yeah. Me, too.
it was a tough spell. I could feel it draining me.
I need practice.
Yeah, well, uh, maybe, I don't know. Maybe you should come over tonight.
we can practice. Get stronger.
Yeah, sure. Thanks.
Ah, incoming.
you want to tell me what the hell happened yesterday?
sorry? - Don't play dumb.
you both were here and... - And?
and that's all I remember.
one minute I'm playing pool and the next I'm waking up in a bathroom stall.
sorry, Luka, but everything seemed normal yesterday.
I brought you a coffee and we played pool.
see, I think you're lying.
and I think you need to back off.
are you still mad? - Yeah, I'm still mad.
we had a difference of opinion, Stefan, We're not always gonna agree on everything.
Elena, you've agreed to sacrifice yourself to Klaus.
to say that we have a difference of opinion is the understatement of the century.
you would know.
what does Jonathan Gilbert have to say?
a lot.
it's insane the things he wrote in his journal
that he kept from the founding families.
stuff that nobody knows. Stuff that... You never told me.
we were, uh...
we were angry at the founding families
for what they did to Katherine.
we wanted revenge.
I didn't know about Jonathan Gilbert's ring yet.
I didn't know that he would...
that he would survive.
he describes you as a monster.
that's what I was.
I want you to know the truth...
but I want you to hear it from me.
in the weeks after I became a vampire, I relished in it.
I took it to the darkest place I could.
who wants to die next?
me, I'm next. - Me, you promised me.
what about you?
you know if you don't pick up the tempo, You're going to lose your head.
snap. Snap.
company, brother?
I brought enough to share.
are you mad bringing them here when the entire town is hunting us?
Damon, if you're worried about the founding families. Please don't be.
they're all dead or about to be.
leave this place. Never think of it again.
same for you. Leave this place. Never think of it again.
Damon, don't be like this. I'm just having some fun.
staying alive is more fun, Stefan.
we have to be more careful than this. More clever.
like Katherine was.
look what that got her.
I'm done here. With you.
I'm leaving town.
you hate me. I know. I know.
an eternity of misery and on and on. I know, but you don't have to leave town.
Damon, I'll do better. I promise.
no, you will get us killed.
I'd rather leave you to do that to yourself.
I wasn't myself then. I was full of guilt.
what I did to my father. To my brother. I had to turn it off.
it was the only way I could survive.
it sounds like you were Damon.
I was worse.
other than the lecture on the history of mystic falls, - Did you get anything out of Elijah? - No, it was boring.
of course, Jenna thinks he's charming. - You sounded jealous.
sound a bit jealous? - Kinda do.
maybe we shouldn't talk about this here.
Andie, she's been compelled not to divulge my secrets, haven't you?
my lips are sealed.
this is too weird.
I just need the right opportunity.
Ah, there's Jenna with her new boyfriend.
Hey, guys.
so I hear you two had quite a meeting of historical minds today.
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
well, as much as I'd love to continue this, I've got papers to grade.
no, you know what? We should continue this. Let's have a dinner party.
Ooh, my girl. Full of good ideas. I'll be happy to host.
say tonight. Maybe?
it's good for me. Jenna?
I don't know if tonight works... - I'm free.
it'd be a pleasure.
great.
drink up. Good girl.
I've come bearing gifts.
I didn't have time to properly shop. But I did get a couple of things.
wow, that blood did the trick.
you're almost pretty again.
what is it you want, Damon?
guess whoes back in town?
your old friend, John Gilbert.
really. Why?
says he loves his daughter.
wants to protect her from Elijah and big, bad Klaus.
touching. - Yeah, right.
he told me this old wives tale About how to kill an original.
and you want to know if it's true.
if it was, I wouldn't tell you.
now, why not?
I mean, you want Elijah and Klaus dead as much as I do.
Klaus, yes. Elijah, no.
he's compelled me to stay in here.
if he dies, I'm stuck forever. - Sucks for you.
forget it, Damon. Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission.
you can't do it. - Can so.
can't.
even with a dagger and a little white oak ash?
no. Damon, if you kill Elijah, then I'm stuck in here forever.
you're really scared.
just get me out of here first and then I'll help you.
I'll... I'll help you kill Elijah or...
or protect Elena. Whatever you want.
I get you out of here and your ass is sipping Klaus-free margaritas
on some unknown island somewhere. No way.
that's not true. I'll stay. Damon, please just don't do it.
well, thank you, you've told me everything I need to know.
I've told you nothing. - You have.
you have indeed confirmed that it is possible to kill an original,
which I will do tonight.
guess who's coming to dinner?
for weeks I kept spiraling.
I was completely driven by the desire for blood.
hunt, prey and kill. That was all I knew.
how come no one caught on to what you were doing?
there was a war going on.
the thing about wartime.
endless, anonymous blood supply.
what kind of an idiot are you?
alexia Branson, as she was known back then.
Lexi? Your best friend Lexi? That's how you met her?
what was she even doing in mystic falls?
she had heard it was a good place for vampires.
needed a place to crash, so I brought her home with me.
I'd say it isn't necessary to take me in,
but you did try to eat me and well, with dawn coming,
beggars can't be choosers.
or should they be?
I, um... I meant to dispose of those.
my god, you're a ripper. - A what?
there are good parts of being a vampire and there are bad parts.
you're the bad parts.
well... We're going to have to change that.
you ok?
talking about her brings up things I'd rather forget.
like Damon killing her?
so what's going on with you and Alaric?
I feel like there's some tension.
I don't know.
I really like him.
it's more than like. And I want it to work,
but I can't help but feel that he's hiding something from me.
and then I've got John whispering things in my ear about him.
like what? - Things I don't want to believe.
things I don't believe, not if they're coming from John's mouth.
Oh. Well, there you go, then. Trust is the key to any relationship.
I mean, I am so grateful that Damon tells me everything.
this is a bad idea.
there's no such thing as a bad idea.
just poorly executed awesome ones. Here.
no.
I don't like the idea of Elijah being in the same house with Jenna.
Jenna's perfectly safe. Besides, it's just a fact-finding mission.
it's totally harmless.
just a fact-finding mission. - Yeah.
listen, no sneak attacks. No surprise plans.
nothing that's gonna put Jenna in harm's way. Ok?
Scout's honor.
Hey, Jenna needs help with the wine.
Thanks. - Yeah.
OK.
what's that? - Dessert.
Elijah's stronger than me. Faster than me.
it's all about the element of surprise.
Ah, it's too bad. I like him. He's very old-school. Classy.
which is why you should encourage the gentlemen
to take their after dinner drinks in here
while you do coffee in the kitchen with the girls.
hmm. That is a little too sexist for me.
stop talking.
who invited him? - John. Surprise. Leave.
when Jenna told me she was coming to a dinner party for Elijah,
I decided I couldn't miss out on all the fun and games.
there are not going to be any games tonight, John.
it's just a friendly dinner party.
what he said.
Thanks. That thing weighs a ton.
I'm starving. You guys have any... food?
Oh, god. Heh! This is a date.
no, no it's not like a date, date.
more of a "hey, I kissed you. And I thought you liked it, um..." hang thing.
Jeremy, I need to make sure Elena is cool with this
before anything else happens.
I didn't realize my sister had approval over who I'm with.
she's my best friend. I tell her everything.
and this whole hang thing might freak her out.
all right, all right, so we'll, um...
we'll hang out, eat some food, work on some spells.
it's not a big deal.
but you did... You did like it, right?
Yeah. I liked it.
good evening. - Thank you for coming. Please, come in.
just one moment.
can I just say that if you have anything less than honorable intentions about how this evening is going to proceed,
I suggest you reconsider.
no, nothing, nothing dishonorable.
just getting to know you.
hmm. Well, that's good.
because, you know, Although Elena and I have this deal,
if you so much as make a move to cross me,
I'll kill you and I'll kill everyone in this house.
are we clear?
crystal.
Jenna. Wonderful to see you again.
how are you? - Nice to see you.
you look incredible. - Thank you.
I hate to break it to you, Damon. But according to Elijah,
your family is so not a founder of this town.
hmm, do tell.
well, as I mentioned to Jenna earlier,
a faction of settlers migrated from Salem After the witch trials in the 1690s.
over the next hundred years they developed this community
where they could feel safe from persecution.
hmm. Because they were witches.
Yeah, but there's no tangible proof there were witches in Salem.
Andie's a journalist. Big on facts.
well, the lore says that there was this wave of anti-witch hysteria.
it broke out in the neighboring settlement, so these witches were rounded up.
they were tied to stakes in a field together. And, uh, burned.
some say you could hear the screams from miles around us.
they were consumed by the fire. Could you pass the...
I wouldn't repeat this to the historical society.
it's starting to sound a little like a ghost story to me.
so why do you want to know the location of these alleged massacres?
you know...
a healthy historian's curiosity, of course.
of course.
jonathan Gilbert got crazier and crazier.
I guess that's what happens when you spend your life obsessed with vampires.
he researched the originals.
you're kidding. - Later in life. Look.
pages and pages of questions and scribbles.
what's that?
the wood from one tree and one tree alone,
an ancient white oak would bring death to an original vampire.
when the tree burned, all hope was thought lost.
he was trying to figure out how to kill an original.
but the ash from the tree was saved.
and witches forged a dagger to which the ash could be bonded.
this alchemic bond provides the necessary poison. - Elena.
I wonder if this is true. I mean, do you think this dagger actually exists?
I know it does...
because John gave it to Damon.
John gave Damon the weapon that's supposed to kill Elijah? This one?
it must be brandished by humans alone, for it will Bring death to all demons who wield it.
John's trying to get Damon killed.
does anyone care for some cognac?
I have a bottle I've been saving for ages.
none for me, thanks. 9 bottles of wine is my limit.
why is your phone off? Call me. - What's going on, Stefan?
Damon is planning on killing Elijah. Tonight.
the gentlemen should take their drinks in the study.
I have to say the food was almost as wonderful as the company.
I like you.
here you are, gentleman, make yourself useful.
here, here. Put me to work.
um, I got it.
Hey, Jenna, are you... are you ok?
Yeah, fine, Ric.
I suspect this is my fault. - What did you do now?
I merely mentioned you haven't been completely honest with her about your dead wife.
you son of bitch.
I think I've been very clear with you, Ric.
I want my ring back.
hello. Slow down. Slow down. Stefan?
so, let me guess.
in addition to the moonstone,
the doppelganger, the lion, the witch and the wardrobe,
you need to find this witch burial ground.
because I feel as though we've grown so close, Damon, I'll tell you yes.
do you know where it is? - Maybe.
tell me why it's so important. - We're not that close.
it's quite a collection you have here.
it's a funny thing about books.
before they existed, people actually had memories.
gentlemen, we forgot about dessert.
Elijah? - Miss.
sorry, guys, dessert is taking longer than I thought.
I usually just unwrap food.
so... I know this is a social thing, but I...
I would really love to ask you some more questions
about the work that you're doing here.
I'd love to answer. - Great. Oh, that's so great.
Ric, would you do me a favor and grab the notebook out of my bag?
Elijah, did John tell you he's Elena's uncle/father?
Yes, I'm well aware of that. - Of course, she hates him, so there's absolutely no need to keep him on the endangered species list.
Ric, it's in the front pocket. On the...
you know what? Excuse me, guys. Sorry.
what I'd like to know, Elijah, is how do you intend on killing Klaus?
gentlemen, there's a few things we should probably get clear right now.
I allow you to live solely to keep on eye on Elena.
I allow Elena to remain in her house
living her life with her friends as she does as a courtesy.
if you become a liability,
I'll take her away from you and you'll never see her again.
OK.
my first question is when you got here to mystic...
now, get rid of him before Jenna comes back with dessert.
all right.
Elena, we need to talk about this.
what good is talking if you and Damon are just gonna lie to me?
if you don't like my decisions, that's fine. There's nothing I can do about that,
but if you ever go behind my back again, I'll...
you're gonna what? Hmm? What are you gonna do, Elena?
it's my life. - Yeah, exactly.
it's your life and I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure that you live it.
then what? This... this...
this trip through the past. You being honest.
was there any truth to that or were you just distracting me?
I was telling you about a time when I thought everything was lost.
when I had given up because that's exactly what you're doing right now.
that is not what... - Yes, it is.
even if you don't want to admit it. You are giving up.
and Lexi, she wouldn't let me give up.
I'm not gonna let you.
all of these men are dead or dying.
what does that make you feel?
nothing. I feel nothing.
because you shut out the part of you that was human.
the part that lets you feel. - Is that not the point?
well, there is a better way. You simply have to want it.
is it better? - Not at first.
you can't choose what you feel.
you have to let it all back in.
the pain and the look in their eyes when you took their life.
the cries of their loved ones. - Why would I want to do that? Hmm?
because once you can hurt, you can love.
love, Stefan. That's the point.
everything is intensified when you're a vampire.
when we hurt, we really hurt.
but when we love...
Lexi showed me that there was another way.
and from that day forward, I started fighting for it.
for my own survival.
that's all I want you to do.
I just want you to fight for it.
now, you said there wasn't going to be any violence.
says the guy that did all the killing.
Hey, I took the shot because I saw an opening,
not because I planned to do this with Jenna in the house.
now, you can't lie to me like that.
Hey, I am your friend, damn it. And you don't have any friends.
so, no more lying.
Elijah's dead.
Alaric did it.
originals believed in truth and honor.
it was forbidden for a vampire to kill another vampire.
so, the dagger would take both lives.
and as long as the dagger stays in place,
the original, for all intents and purposes, is dead.
what happened? - I need you to find Elena.
now.
now that is cool. How does it work?
it's called channeling. Siphoning power from something...
another witch...
the moon, an element.
so, technically, you could channel me.
what? Well, I'm an element, sort of.
I mean, isn't... isn't the human body mostly water?
you're right.
that's... That's what happens.
what the hell are you doing here?
Jeremy! - What did my son tell you? What did he tell you?
he told me about your daughter.
I know Klaus has her and I want to help you get her back.
but I want us to work together. Please.
this is for your own good.
No! No. No!
if any harm comes to my son because of what you did, you will answer to me.
you ok? It's ok.
what happened?
he took my powers.
he's here.
you have to go. I need to talk to him alone.
Elena. - Stefan, I'm ok. He can't come in the house.
you know, I might not be able to enter this house...
but I'm a very patient man.
I'll wait you out.
they shouldn't have done what they did.
the deal is off. - I'm renegotiating.
you have nothing left to negotiate with.
I'd like to see you lure Klaus into mystic falls after the doppelganger bleeds to death.
Stefan won't let you die. - No, he won't.
he'll feed me his blood to heal me,
and then I'll kill myself and become a vampire, just like Catherine did.
so unless you want that to happen again,
promise me the same as before... promise me...
you won't harm anyone that I love.
even if they've harmed you.
I'm sorry, Elena.
I'm going to have to call your bluff.
No!
Yes. Yes, you can have your deal.
let me heal you. - Give me your word!
I give you my word.
little tip.
don't pull the dagger out.
where did John disappear to?
maybe the same place the rest of the dinner party ran off to.
look, Jenna, I'm, uh...
I'm so sorry tonight was... - What happened to Isobel?
you know, John should have never brought that up.
that's not an answer. - He's just trying to stir up trouble.
that's not an answer, either. - I can't talk about this, Jenna.
I keep thinking that maybe it's me.
maybe I'm reading into things.
I should trust you.
that's what a relationship is about, right?
but then I think that maybe John is right
and maybe you're not being honest with me.
so...
are you being honest?
right, ok.
well, that was an answer.
well, that was awkward.
you know, I can clear all this stuff up about Isabel tomorrow, if you want.
or not.
you want it? Take it. It's yours.
and after what you did to Damon...
you're gonna need it more than me.
what do we have here?
a little moonstone bar of soap.
I'll hold on to this.
so, that's it.
I mean, as long as we keep the dagger in there, then he stays dead.
pretty much.
OK, then... Good night.
you know, you guys want me to fight, fine, I'll fight.
but if we're gonna do this, you can't keep anything from me anymore.
from this moment on, we're doing it my way.
that seems fair.
OK. - Ok.
seems like she's had a change of attitude.
how did you get through to her?
I told her a little story
about when I was making the wrong decisions
and somebody showed me there was a better way.
Lexi? - Yeah.
you remember her?
going somewhere?
you must be the vampire I hear my brother complaining about.
that would be me.
and you must be the brother who hates him.
we are at irreparable odds.
you know the hate you're feeling towards Stefan? Towards everyone?
you think you have it under control but you don't.
it will get the best of you.
help him.
he needs it.
I'll help him.
Andie? I thought you left.
Hello, Damon.
Hey, do you have a robe?
how did you get out?
I knew that if I begged you not to kill Elijah.That's exactly what you'd do.
little known fact... originals can compel vampires.
but as soon as they die, the compulsion wears off.
and you knew? - And I'm still here. I didn't run.
I meant what I said to him, Damon. I'm going to help you.
so... How about that robe?
you must be Elena. - How do we look exactly alike?
you are a part of a doppelganger. You're the key to breaking the curse.
is that the blue curse? - The Curse is the real deal.
from the first generation of vampires.
the oldest vampire in the history of time Is coming after me?
one of the originals. - He's a legend.
I'm prepared to offer you a deal. - What kind of a deal?
you and I shall drop out and I shall make certain your friends remain unharmed.
and then what? - Then I kill him.
take me far, far away. - Where would you like to go?
these must be the other Jonathon gilbert journals.
I come bearing gifts. This is how you kill an original.
that ring Isobel gave you. That's mine. I'm gonna want that back.
did he ever tell you what happened to his wife?
what are you saying? - Why don't you ask Rick?
how will you kill Klaus? - After the sacrifice.
after the sacrifice? - Elena has to die.
you knew that you weren't going to survive this?
if it comes down to the people that I love Getting killed and me,
I know what my choice is going to be.
you're being a martyr. That's not heroic. It's tragic.
with the dying embers of the fire At fell's church, the scourge of the vampires had passed.
and though war raged all around us,
our town was safe from the demons of the night...
or so we thought.
for the monsters we drove to their fiery deaths Had begat new monsters.
did you hear that?
stay here. - No, Thomas.
it's all right, dear, the vampires are all dead.
Yes, Honoria, they burned in the church. We're safe now.
please, Jonathon. I'm worried.
very well. I shall go, too.
I can prove there are no vampires.
see.
Thomas! - No, stay inside! Get back in the house!
No!
I knew I was about to die.
you cannot run from a vampire.
I saw the vampire who killed me.
I recognized him.
what's going on? - Well, I showered. I shaved.
had breakfast. Very relaxed. - That makes one of us.
I did hear one piece of good news though.
Tyler Lockwood ran away from home last night.
how do you know?
well, I heard it from sheriff Forbes,
who heard it from a very distraught Carol Lockwood,
thus, ending our werewolf chapter, bringing us to...
killing Elijah. - Exactly.
well, it's not going to be easy. He's crafty.
well, I've got a crafty little dagger.
he's an original. We don't know what all that encompasses.
Oh, trust me, Stefan. I'm gonna dot all my t's. I don't want any surprises.
wow, Damon, tell me you're actually gonna be careful for once.
Yes, Stefan, I've become you. How tragic for both of us.
got to run. I've a murder to plan. Busy day.
the old fell property actually starts just beyond that fence.
Ah, the fells. One of the "founding families.
why do you say it like that?
my research showed me that this area was actually settled
almost two full centuries earlier.
it was a migration of townsfolk from the northeast,
um, it was Salem, to be precise.
Massachusetts? As in the witch trials?
which means the ever lauded founding families...
they didn't actually found anything.
well, I bet it was the men who made a big deal about being founders back in 1860.
men are very territorial.
Yes, they are.
Elijah, this is my friend, Alaric Saltzman.
Yeah, I got your message about walking Elijah here Through the old property lines.
I thought I would tag along.
you know being a history buff and all.
where to next?
I'm pretty curious about the freed slave property owners.
some say, you know, the descendents of the slaves are the true keepers of American history.
well, I only brought the surveys. I got the list in the car just give me a sec.
so you're one of those people On Elena's list of loved ones to protect.
so is Jenna. - You don't have to be jealous.
I don't really pursue younger women.
it's a joke, Ric, lighten up. - Right.
Hey, what are you doing?
thinking about last night. - Yeah, yeah. Me, too.
it was a tough spell. I could feel it draining me.
I need practice.
Yeah, well, uh, maybe, I don't know. Maybe you should come over tonight.
we can practice. Get stronger.
Yeah, sure. Thanks.
Ah, incoming.
you want to tell me what the hell happened yesterday?
sorry? - Don't play dumb.
you both were here and... - And?
and that's all I remember.
one minute I'm playing pool And the next I'm waking up in a bathroom stall.
sorry, Luka, but everything seemed normal yesterday.
I brought you a coffee and we played pool.
see, I think you're lying.
and I think you need to back off.
are you still mad? - Yeah, I'm still mad.
we had a difference of opinion, Stefan, We're not always gonna agree on everything.
Elena, you've agreed to sacrifice yourself to Klaus.
to say that we have a difference of opinion Is the understatement of the century.
you would know.
what does Jonathan gilbert have to say?
a lot.
it's insane the things he wrote in his journal
that he kept from the founding families.
stuff that nobody knows. Stuff that... You never told me.
we were, uh...
we were angry at the founding families
for what they did to Katherine.
we wanted revenge.
I didn't know about Jonathan gilbert's ring yet.
I didn't know that he would...
that he would survive.
he describes you as a monster.
that's what I was.
I want you to know the truth...
but I want you to hear it from me.
in the weeks after I became a vampire, I relished in it.
I took it to the darkest place I could.
who wants to die next?
me, I'm next. - Me, you promised me.
what about you?
you know if you don't pick up the tempo, You're going to lose your head.
snap. Snap.
company, brother?
I brought enough to share.
are you mad bringing them here When the entire town is hunting us?
Damon, if you're worried about the founding families, Please don't be.
they're all dead or about to be.
leave this place. Never think of it again.
same for you. Leave this place. Never think of it again.
Damon, don't be like this. I'm just having some fun.
staying alive is more fun, Stefan.
we have to be more careful than this. More clever.
like Katherine was.
look what that got her.
I'm done here. With you.
I'm leaving town.
you hate me. I know. I know.
an eternity of misery and on and on. I know, But you don't have to leave town.
Damon, I'll do better. I promise.
no, you will get us killed.
I'd rather leave you to do that to yourself.
I wasn't myself then. I was full of guilt.
what I did to my father. To my brother. I had to turn it off.
it was the only way I could survive.
it sounds like you were Damon.
I was worse.
other than the lecture on the history of mystic falls, - Did you get anything out of Elijah? - No, it was boring.
of course, Jenna thinks he's charming. - You sounded jealous.
sound a bit jealous? - Kinda do.
maybe we shouldn't talk about this here.
Andie, she's been compelled Not to divulge my secrets. Haven't you?
my lips are sealed.
this is too weird.
I just need the right opportunity.
Ah, there's Jenna with her new boyfriend.
Hey, guys.
so I hear you two had quite a meeting Of historical minds today.
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
well, as much as I'd love to continue this, I've got papers to grade.
no, you know what? We should continue this. Let's have a dinner party.
Ooh, my girl. Full of good ideas. I'll be happy to host.
say tonight. Maybe?
it's good for me. Jenna?
I don't know if tonight works... - I'm free.
it'd be a pleasure.
great.
drink up. Good girl.
I've come bearing gifts.
I didn't have time to properly shop, But I did get a couple of things.
wow, that blood did the trick.
you're almost pretty again.
what is it you want, Damon?
guess whoes back in town?
your old friend, John Gilbert.
really. Why?
says he loves his daughter.
wants to protect her from Elijah and big, bad Klaus.
touching. - Yeah, right.
he told me this old wives tale About how to kill an original.
and you want to know if it's true.
if it was, I wouldn't tell you.
now, why not?
I mean, you want Elijah and Klaus Dead as much as I do.
Klaus, yes. Elijah, no.
he's compelled me to stay in here.
if he dies, I'm stuck forever. - Sucks for you.
forget it, Damon. Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission.
you can't do it. - Can so.
can't.
even with a dagger and a little white oak ash?
no. Damon, if you kill Elijah, Then I'm stuck in here forever.
you're really scared.
just get me out of here first And then I'll help you.
I'll... I'll help you kill Elijah Or...
or protect Elena. Whatever you want.
I get you out of here and your ass Is sipping Klaus-free margaritas
on some unknown island somewhere. No way.
that's not true. I'll stay. Damon, please just don't do it.
well, thank you, you've told me everything I need to know.
I've told you nothing. - You have.
you have indeed confirmed That it is possible to kill an original,
which I will do tonight.
guess who's coming to dinner?
for weeks I kept spiraling.
I was completely driven by the desire for blood.
hunt, prey and kill. That was all I knew.
how come no one caught on To what you were doing?
there was a war going on.
the thing about wartime.
endless, anonymous blood supply.
what kind of an idiot are you?
alexia Branson, as she was known back then.
Lexi? Your best friend Lexi? That's how you met her?
what was she even doing in mystic falls?
she had heard it was a good place for vampires.
you know, had no idea that they'd all been massacred.
needed a place to crash, so I brought her home with me.
I'd say it isn't necessary to take me in,
but you did try to eat me and well, with dawn coming,
beggars can't be choosers.
or should they be?
I, um... I meant to dispose of those.
my god, you're a ripper. - A what?
there are good parts of being a vampire And there are bad parts.
you're the bad parts.
well... We're going to have to change that.
you ok?
talking about her brings up things I'd rather forget.
like Damon killing her?
so what's going on with you and Alaric?
I feel like there's some tension.
I don't know.
I really like him.
it's more than like And I want it to work,
but I can't help but feel that he's hiding Something from me.
and then I've got john Whispering things in my ear about him.
like what? - Things I don't want to believe.
things I don't believe, Not if they're coming from john's mouth.
Oh. Well, there you go, then. Trust is the key to any relationship.
I mean, I am so grateful that Damon tells me everything.
this is a bad idea.
there's no such thing as a bad idea.
just poorly executed awesome ones. Here.
no.
I don't like the idea of Elijah being In the same house with Jenna.
Jenna's perfectly safe. Besides, it's just a fact-finding mission.
it's totally harmless.
just a fact-finding mission. - Yeah.
listen, no sneak attacks. No surprise plans.
nothing that's gonna put Jenna in harm's way. Ok?
Scout's honor.
Hey, Jenna needs help with the wine.
Thanks. - Yeah.
OK.
what's that? - Dessert.
Elijah's stronger than me. Faster than me.
it's all about the element of surprise.
Ah, it's too bad. I like him. He's very old-school. Classy.
which is why you should encourage the gentlemen
to take their after dinner drinks in here
while you do coffee in in the kitchen with the girls.
hmm. That is a little too sexist for me.
stop talking.
who invited him? - John. Surprise. Leave.
when Jenna told me she was coming to a dinner party For Elijah,
I decided I couldn't miss out on all the fun and games.
there are not going to be any games tonight, John.
it's just a friendly dinner party.
what he said.
Thanks. That thing weighs a ton.
I'm starving. You guys have any... Food?
Oh, god. Heh! This is a date.
no, no it's not like a date, date.
more of a "hey, I kissed you. And I thought you liked it, um..." Hang thing.
Jeremy, I need to make sure Elena is cool with this
before anything else happens.
I didn't realize my sister had approval over who I'm with.
she's my best friend. I tell her everything.
and this whole hang thing might freak her out.
all right, all right, so we'll, um...
we'll hang out, eat some food, Work on some spells.
it's not a big deal.
but you did... You did like it, right?
Yeah. I liked it.
good evening. - Thank you for coming. Please, come in.
just one moment.
can I just say that if you have anything less Than honorable intentions about how this evening is going To proceed,
I suggest you reconsider.
no, nothing, nothing dishonorable.
just getting to know you.
hmm. Well, that's good.
because, you know, Although Elena and I have this deal,
if you so much as make a move to cross me,
I'll kill you and I'll kill everyone in this house.
are we clear?
crystal.
Jenna. Wonderful to see you again.
how are you? - Nice to see you.
you look incredible. - Thank you.
I hate to break it to you, Damon, But according to Elijah,
your family is so not a founder of this town.
hmm, do tell.
well, as I mentioned to Jenna earlier,
a faction of settlers migrated from Salem After the witch trials in the 1690s.
over the next hundred years they developed this community
where they could feel safe from persecution.
hmm. Because they were witches.
Yeah, but there's no tangible proof There were witches in Salem.
Andie's a journalist. Big on facts.
well, the lore says that there was this wave Of anti-witch hysteria.
it broke out in the neighboring Settlement, so these witches were rounded up.
they were tied to stakes in a field together. And, uh, burned.
some say you could hear the screams from miles around us.
they were consumed by the fire. Could you pass the...
I wouldn't repeat this to the historical society.
it's starting to sound a little like a ghost story to me.
so why do you want to know The location of these alleged massacres?
you know...
a healthy historian's curiosity, of course.
of course.
jonathan gilbert got crazier and crazier.
I guess that's what happens when you spend your life obsessed with vampires.
he researched the originals.
you're kidding. - Later in life. Look.
pages and pages of questions and scribbles.
what's that?
the wood from one tree and one tree alone,
an ancient white oak would bring death to an original vampire.
when the tree burned, all hope was thought lost.
he was trying to figure out how to kill an original.
but the ash from the tree was saved.
and witches forged a dagger to which the ash Could be bonded.
this alchemic bond provides the necessary poison. - Elena.
I wonder if this is true. I mean, do you think this dagger actually exists?
I know it does...
because john gave it to Damon.
John gave Damon the weapon That's supposed to kill Elijah? This one?
it must be brandished by humans alone, for it will Bring death to all demons who wield it.
John's trying to get Damon killed.
does anyone care for some cognac?
I have a bottle I've been saving for ages.
none for me, thanks. 9 bottles of wine is my limit.
why is your phone off? Call me. - What's going on, Stefan?
Damon is planning on killing Elijah. Tonight.
the gentlemen should take their drinks in the study.
I have to say the food was almost As wonderful as the company.
I like you.
here you are, gentleman, make yourself useful.
here, here. Put me to work.
um, I got it.
Hey, Jenna, are you... are you ok?
Yeah, fine, Ric.
I suspect this is my fault. - What did you do now?
I merely mentioned you haven't been completely honest
with her about your dead wife.
you son of bitch.
I think I've been very clear with you, Ric.
I want my ring back.
hello. Slow down. Slow down. Stefan?
so, let me guess.
in addition to the moonstone,
the doppelganger, the lion, The witch and the wardrobe,
you need to find this witch burial ground.
because I feel as though we've grown so close, Damon, I'll tell you yes.
do you know where it is? - Maybe.
tell me why it's so important. - We're not that close.
it's quite a collection you have here.
it's a funny thing about books.
before they existed, people actually had memories.
gentlemen, we forgot about dessert.
Elijah? - Miss.
sorry, guys, dessert is taking longer than I thought.
I usually just unwrap food.
so... I know this is a social thing, But I...
I would really love to ask you some more questions
about the work that you're doing here.
I'd love to answer. - Great. Oh, that's so great.
Ric, would you do me a favor and grab the notebook out of my bag?
Elijah, did john tell you he's Elena's uncle/father?
Yes, I'm well aware of that. - Of course, she hates him, so there's absolutely no need To keep him on the endangered species list.
Ric, it's in the front pocket. On the...
you know what? Excuse me, guys. Sorry.
what I'd like to know, Elijah, Is how do you intend on killing Klaus?
gentlemen, there's a few things We should probably get clear right now.
I allow you to live solely to keep on eye on Elena.
I allow Elena to remain in her house
living her life with her friends as she does As a courtesy.
if you become a liability,
I'll take her away from you and you'll never see her again.
OK.
my first question is when you got here to mystic...
now, get rid of him before Jenna comes back with dessert.
all right.
Elena, we need to talk about this.
what good is talking if you and Damon are just gonna lie to me?
if you don't like my decisions, that's fine. There's nothing I can do about that,
but if you ever go behind my back again, I'll...
you're gonna what? Hmm? What are you gonna do, Elena?
it's my life. - Yeah, exactly.
it's your life and I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure that you live it.
then what? This... this...
this trip through the past. You being honest.
was there any truth to that or were you just distracting me?
I was telling you about a time When I thought everything was lost.
when I had given up because That's exactly what you're doing right now.
that is not what... - Yes, it is.
even if you don't want to admit it. You are giving up.
and Lexi, She wouldn't let me give up.
I'm not gonna let you.
all of these men are dead or dying.
what does that make you feel?
nothing. I feel nothing.
because you shut out the part of you that was human.
the part that lets you feel. - Is that not the point?
well, there is a better way. You simply have to want it.
is it better? - Not at first.
you can't choose what you feel.
you have to let it all back in.
the pain and the look in their eyes when you took their life.
the cries of their loved ones. - Why would I want to do that? Hmm?
because once you can hurt, you can love.
love, Stefan. That's the point.
everything is intensified when you're a vampire.
when we hurt, we really hurt.
but when we love...
Lexi showed me that there was another way.
and from that day forward, I started fighting for it.
for my own survival.
that's all I want you to do.
I just want you to fight for it.
now, you said there wasn't going to be any violence.
says the guy that did all the killing.
Hey, I took the shot because I saw an opening,
not because I planned to do this with Jenna In the house.
now, you can't lie to me like that.
Hey, I am your friend, damn it. And you don't have any friends.
so, no more lying.
Elijah's dead.
Alaric did it.
originals believed in truth and honor.
it was forbidden for a vampire to kill another vampire.
so, the dagger would take both lives.
and as long as the dagger stays in place,
the original, for all intents and purposes, is dead.
what happened? - I need you to find Elena.
now.
now that is cool. How does it work?
it's called channeling. Siphoning power from something...
another witch...
the moon, an elephant.
so, technically, you could channel me.
what? Well, I'm an element, sort of.
I mean, isn't... isn't the human body mostly water?
you're right.
that's... That's what happens.
what the hell are you doing here?
Jeremy! - What did my son tell you? What did he tell you?
he told me about your daughter.
I know Klaus has her and I want to help you get her back.
but I want us to work together. Please.
this is for your own good.
No! No. No!
if any harm comes to my son Because of what you did, you will answer to me.
you ok? It's ok.
what happened?
he took my powers.
he's here.
you have to go. I need to talk to him alone.
Elena. - Stefan, I'm ok. He can't come in the house.
you know, I might not be able to enter this house...
but I'm a very patient man.
I'll wait you out.
they shouldn't have done what they did.
the deal is off. - I'm renegotiating.
you have nothing left to negotiate with.
I'd like to see you lure Klaus into mystic falls
after the doppelganger bleeds to death.
Stefan won't let you die. - No, he won't.
he'll feed me his blood to heal me,
and then I'll kill myself and become a vampire, Just like Catherine did.
so unless you want that to happen again,
promise me the same as before... promise me...
you won't harm anyone that I love.
even if they've harmed you.
I'm sorry, Elena.
I'm going to have to call your bluff.
No!
Yes. Yes, you can have your deal.
let me heal you. - Give me your word!
I give you my word.
little tip.
don't pull the dagger out.
where did john disappear to?
maybe the same place the rest of the dinner party ran off to.
look, Jenna, I'm, uh...
I'm so sorry tonight was... - What happened to Isobel?
you know, john should have never brought that up.
that's not an answer. - He's just trying to stir up trouble.
that's not an answer, either. - I can't talk about this, Jenna.
I keep thinking that maybe it's me.
maybe I'm reading into things.
I should trust you.
that's what a relationship is about, right?
but then I think that maybe john is right
and maybe you're not being honest with me.
so...
are you being honest?
right, ok.
well, that was an answer.
well, that was awkward.
you know, I can clear all this stuff up About Isobel tomorrow, if you want.
or not.
you want it? Take it. It's yours.
and after what you did to Damon...
you're gonna need it more than me.
what do we have here?
a little moonstone bar of soap.
I'll hold on to this.
so, that's it.
I mean, as long as we keep the dagger In there, then he stays dead.
pretty much.
OK, then... Good night.
you know, you guys want me to fight, fine, I'll fight.
but if we're gonna do this, You can't keep anything from me anymore.
from this moment on, we're doing it my way.
that seems fair.
OK. - Ok.
seems like she's had a change of attitude.
how did you get through to her?
I told her a little story
about when I was making the wrong decisions
and somebody showed me there was a better way.
Lexi? - Yeah.
you remember her?
going somewhere?
you must be the vampire I hear my brother complaining about.
that would be me.
and you must be the brother who hates him.
we are at irreparable odds.
you know the hate you're feeling towards Stefan? Towards everyone?
you think you have it under control but you don't.
it will get the best of you.
help him.
he needs it.
I'll help him.
Andie? I thought you left.
Hello, Damon.
Hey, do you have a robe?
how did you get out?
I knew that if I begged you not to kill Elijah, That's exactly what you'd do.
little known fact... originals can compel vampires.
but as soon as they die, the compulsion wears off.
and you knew? - And I'm still here. I didn't run.
I meant what I said to him, Damon. I'm going to help you.
so... How about that robe?
you must be Elena.
how do we look exactly alike?
you're a Petrova doppelganger.
you're the key to breaking the curse.
the sun and the moon curse?
vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
Klaus is the real deal.
from the first generation of vampires.
the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me?
Katerina, I have missed you.
Klaus! - Klaus is in Alaric's body.
he's possessing it!
and while I'm gone, you stay here, Katerina.
Elijah.
one of the originals. He's a legend.
so that's it.
as long as we keep the dagger in there, then he stays dead.
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
but he believed that if a witch could channel their power, it wouldn't need one.
he says if you use too much of your powers at once, it'll kill you.
Bonnie will not die for me.
I will not let that happen.
she's the only one who can do it.
we'll find another way.
Elijah.
Katerina!
excuse me.
Ah, good evening, Trefor.
I am pleased you could join us.
I could not miss the birthday celebration.
no, considering the gift you claim to bear.
where is this mystery girl of which you speak?
right this way.
my dear.
hello.
Elijah! It's me, it's Elena.
Shh.
Oh, my god.
forgive me. You remind me of someone.
Katerina, may I introduce the Lord Elijah.
pleasure, my lord.
the pleasure's mine. Katerina.
what...
I can't--I can't breathe!
what's happened to me?
are you ok?
I can't...I can't be in this house.
you're not invited in.
you need to get me out of here.
what happened?
I'll tell you.
not here.
can I trust you?
can I trust you?
Elena!
Hey. - Hey.
have you seen Elena? - Uh, no.
Hi, sweetie.
Oh, my coffee.
good morning. - Mm, good morning.
Hey, where's Elena? - I don't know, Stefan.
it's your girlfriend. Mine's right here.
Oh, and how's the shoulder? Got time for a bite?
I'm so hungry. - Oh, it's really messy.
can you just use a blood bag today?
I'm already late for work. - No!
Hey, it's me. Where are you? Call me.
what are you doing?
she's not a wind-up toy.
it's really none of your business, is it, Stefan?
Yeah.
what she said.
I have to go to work.
Ugh! Bye. - Ok.
no, she didn't.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Yes, do hurry.
I'm anxious to get out of this body.
and if you get hung up, call me. You know how impatient I get.
where is he going?
to retrieve me.
so I can get out of this bad hair-do.
are you sure that's a good idea, Klaus?
well, the full moon is almost upon us.
I've killed the witch, I have the moon stone, and the doppelganger is waiting in the wings.
Oh, I am ready to break this curse.
and why would you do that here?
there's so many people that would try to stop you.
because I have to.
it's the birth place of the doppelganger.
I didn't realize that was a requirement.
well, how could you? You betrayed me and fled England before I could give you the details, Katerina.
but I did find your birth place and I slaughtered your family.
so I guess we're cool.
let's just hope that Elena isn't as stupid as you are.
she won't run.
she'll die before she lets anyone that she loves get hurt.
and that's exactly what I'm counting on.
you can't leave until I tell you to.
you look better.
where did you get the dagger?
I'll tell you everything.
but we have to work together, Elijah.
I need your word.
your ability to make demands has long passed.
no demands.
I'm offering you my help.
and in return, I want yours.
and why should I even consider this?
the same reason that you haven't killed me.
you need my help to kill Klaus.
and I need you.
where are you?
are you ok? - Yes, I'm fine.
Where's Elijah? - He's right here.
where? I'm on my way.
no, Stefan, Elijah and I need some time alone.
listen to me. He can't be trusted.
he'll use you to get to Klaus.
Elijah is a noble man, Stefan.
he lives by a code of honor. I can trust him.
he knows that I'd be incredibly stupid to betray him again.
by removing the dagger, I have proven myself.
you can't do this alone. - It's my decision,
Stefan. Please respect it.
and make sure that Damon doesn't do anything stupid.
we'll be in touch.
did she just hang up on you?
she did. - She's lost it.
if anyone can get him to help us kill Klaus, it's her.
Bonnie's the way to kill Klaus, Stefan.
he thinks she's dead.
we have a chance with her.
she'll kill herself in the process.
Elena's looking for another way.
her way's going to get her killed.
so we need to find her and stop her.
no, you need to back off. - What?!
look, I don't like this any more than you do.
but we need to trust her.
we gotta just let her do her thing.
that might be your plan.
mine's better.
I said back off.
he's here.
Klaus is here?
he's taken over Alaric's body.
of course he has.
one of his favorite tricks.
well, what are his other tricks?
what is he going to do next?
you're the only one who knows him.
Yes, I do.
so where is this mysterious host I've heard so much about?
fashionably late.
he likes to make an entrance.
here he is.
Katerina, may I introduce to you the Lord Niklaus.
Niklaus is the name my father gave me.
please call me Klaus.
Elijah!
Elena, what are you doing here?
what happened?
I've had a bit of an incident, Carol.
I'm hoping you could help.
well, I'm on my way to a meeting, so I
we won't take but a minute of your time.
of course. Anything you need.
thank you.
well, first things first.
I'm going to need a change of clothing.
well, we can try one of my husband's suits.
I haven't boxed them up yet.
wonderful.
how did you know she's not on vervain?
cause I'm the one who got her off it.
right before you and your friends killed me.
twice.
if you'll excuse me, I'll be down a moment.
Hello? - Hey, Stefan.
it's Jenna. - Jenna, hey.
Where's Elena? And Jeremy?
no one's answering their phones.
Ah, Elena's not here at the moment.
is ah... Is everything ok?
she left me all these weird messages telling me to stay away from Rick.
what's going on?
it's really hard to explain over the phone, but, she was hoping that you could stay on campus for a little while longer.
Oh, that's kinda hard to do from my kitchen.
wait, you're home?
Yeah. What's going on? Where's Elena?
I'm supposed to meet Rick at the Grill for lunch, - to talk. - Jenna, listen to me carefully.
whatever you do, do not meet Alaric at the Grill.
I'm going to come over right now and I'll explain everything.
wow, I'd love to lend you a hand, but you wouldn't want me doing anything stupid.
seriously going to be like this?
you and your girlfriend are calling the shots.
I'm just backing off, Stefan.
let's go. - Where are we going?
splitting from the team. Going rogue.
come on.
so I assume that the Martin witches are no longer with us.
no.
I'm sorry.
and Katerina.
she would have been released from my compulsion when I died.
Klaus took her.
we think that she may be dead.
I doubt that.
not Klaus' style.
death would be too easy for her after what she did.
I don't understand.
you say that you want Klaus dead, but you still made Katherine pay for betraying him.
I have my own reasons for wanting Katerina to pay.
there was a time...
I'd have done anything for Klaus.
from where have you come, Katerina?
I'm new to town, my lord.
Katerina is from Bulgaria.
Katerina.
very good.
do you mind, brother?
I would like to have a moment alone with her.
not at all. Happy birthday, brother.
Yes.
Klaus is my brother.
I heard that.
I'm still processing.
Yes, I'm a little behind on the times, but I believe the term you're searching for is "O. M.G.
I really don't think that this is a good idea.
you're an investigative journalist.
we're investigating.
Alaric, are you home?
it's Andie Starr, Jenna's friend.
thank god.
Wow! You were right.
she looks exactly like Elena.
Yep.
thought you might be dead.
unfortunately not.
Hey, Jenna. Thank you so much for not going to the Grill.
um, Stefan-- - No, listen.
I can explain.
Hi, Stefan.
how's it going?
there's a whole family of originals?
my father was a wealthy land owner in a village in Eastern Europe.
our mother bore seven children.
so your parents were human?
our whole family was.
our origin as vampires is a very long story, Elena.
just know... We're the oldest vampires in the world.
we are the original family, and from us all, vampires were created.
right, but Klaus is your brother.
and you want him dead?
I need some air.
I'm still feeling a tad...dead.
come.
what are you doing here?
we are here to rescue you.
no, sweetie.
we are here to see if she deserves to be rescued.
right.
I figured you still might be kicking.
Alaric-Klaus was blending way too easily.
figured he had probably had some coaching.
is that...
vervain? Your salvation.
it's not going to undo anything.
there's always a loophole. Did he tell you to stay in this apartment until he said it was ok to leave?
you can't say.
did he tell you to do absolutely everything he says until the end of time?
no. - There's your loophole.
drink this and prevent any further compulsion.
give it to me.
answer one question first.
you double-crossed us with Isobel, why?
I didn't think you could stand a chance against Klaus,
so I was looking out for myself.
and where did that get you?
here.
be careful with that.
if he finds out you have that,
you're never getting out of here.
you owe me.
and I will collect.
come on.
nice to meet you.
you know, I find chopping...
calming.
the feel of the blade in the hand, maybe.
I'm still waiting for someone to tell me what the hell's going on.
well, would you like to tell her, Stefan, or should I?
tell me what?
do you believe in vampires, Jenna?
no?
well, who does, right?
but believe it or not,
they do have a place in our history.
and as a history teacher,
I find them fascinating.
why are we talking about this?
well, you've been angry with me for keeping secrets,
and this is one of my secrets.
I'm obsessed with vampires.
there. I said it.
are you joking?
not at all.
how about you, Stefan?
are you a fan of vampires?
in literature.
Bram Stoker.
it's dense, but I appreciate it.
hmm. Did you know that vampires are the oldest creatures of the night?
except for werewolves, of course.
werewolves.
werewolves.
now I know you're joking.
you know, I've read that there's an Aztec curse on both species.
that keeps werewolves slaves to the moon
and vampires bound by the sun.
isn't that right, Stefan?
you know, they say these creatures would do anything to have this curse broken.
and that they wouldn't care who they had to kill to do it.
so as you've seen, nothing can kill an original.
not sun, not fire, not even a werewolf bite.
only the wood from one tree;
a tree my family made sure burned.
that's where the white ash for the dagger comes from. - Yes.
the witches won't allow anything truly immortal to walk the earth.
every creature needs to have a weakness in order to maintain the balance.
so the sun can't kill an original.
why is Klaus so obsessed with breaking the sun and moon curse?
right.
the curse of the sun and the moon.
it's also... Biblical-sounding, don't you think?
what's so funny?
look, The Roman parchment.
I remember etching this scroll.
well, I was quite blistered from drink.
your finest work remains your Aztec drawings.
not the African carvings?
cause I was quite proud of those.
the Aztec.
who can resist a shaman?
Yes.
I don't understand.
so Klaus drew the Aztec sketches about the curse?
Roman scrolls, African tribal etchings,
and any other culture or continent we felt like planting in it.
but why?
easiest way to discover the existence of a doppelganger or to get your hands on some long, lost moon stone is to have every single member of two warring species on the lookout.
so it's not Aztec at all?
the curse of the sun and the moon...Is fake.
it doesn't exist.
what?
Oh, I know this all sounds so crazy,
But...Vampires are real.
would you care for some more wine?
get out. - Excuse me?
I don't know what it is you're trying to do
or why you're saying these things, but
Jenna. - I said get out!
you heard her.
I'm afraid I don't want to.
fine! I'll go.
you're not going anywhere.
Stefan!
Jenna, get out of here now!
you can't kill me, Stefan. -Watch me!
Stefan!
I may not have a witch protecting me today,
but if you kill this body,
what's to stop me from choosing Jenna as my next one?
Jenna, go.
but you're--you
I said go!
kill me.
just remind Elena how easy it will be for me to get my revenge
if she tries to stop me from breaking this curse.
Klaus and I faked the sun and moon curse dating back over a thousand years.
but if there's no curse...
there's a curse. Just not that one.
the real one's much worse.
it's a curse placed on Klaus.
what are you talking about?
Klaus has been trying to break it for the last thousand years.
you were his only hope.
what is this curse?
your phone will not stop its incessant buzzing.
answer it, please.
Stefan
what's wrong?
no.
no, no, no, no.
OK, I'll be right there.
Klaus went after Jenna. I have to go to her.
I'm afraid that wasn't part of today's arrangement.
she's my family, Elijah. I have to.
I'll be back.
you have my word.
that doesn't mean anything to me until you live up to it.
thank you.
you have to chase me!
you're meant to catch me.
but if I catch you, the game will be over.
thank you for entertaining me.
you seemed lonely inside, so I took pity on you.
Klaus promised to spend the day with me, but he never returned home from the night.
Yes, Klaus does not live by any rules but his own.
he is a very charming man.
hard for anyone to resist, I suppose.
and yet...
I know not why he courts me.
he seems to not care about me at all.
many a union has been built on much less.
is it wrong to want more?
did you have more with Trefor?
Trefor believes that he loves me, but true love is not real unless it's returned.
do you agree?
I do not believe in love, Katerina.
that is too sad for me to accept, my lord.
life is too cruel.
if we cease to believe in love, why would we want to live?
what do I interrupt? - He's returned.
long night.
what has happened?
the wrong village picked a fight at the tavern.
Oh, Jenna, thank god.
no.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
when I was little, your mom used to tell me bedtime stories.
stories about vampires.
I never thought that what she said could be true.
it is true, Jenna.
I should have told you.
I thought that if you didn't know, you'd be safe.
but then things got so out of control.
and everything I had done to keep you out of it, it just blew up in my face.
who else knows?
Jeremy?
John?
we were just trying to protect you.
protect me? - I'm so sorry.
I will tell you everything.
no, Elena...I am the one who's supposed to be protecting you - and Jeremy. - I know, but there's nothing that you could have done. There's so much more to it
no, this is-- this is so
I don't know how-- it's
I know, hey.
why didn't you tell me?!
I'm scared.
I know.
I know.
I know, hey.
I'm sorry.
Jenna, I am so, so sorry.
is she gonna be ok?
she's in shock.
I tried to tell her as much as I could, but I barely scratched the surface.
I'm so sorry, Elena.
I hate this.
it's not your fault, Stefan.
it's mine.
anyway...
I have to go back.
to Elijah.
wait, what? No, no!
Stefan, I promised him that I would return.
I can't break that promise.
Oh.
Yeah.
I'll be ok.
where do you think you're going?
back to Elijah. - No.
get out of my way, damn
if you so much as try and take a step out of this house...
Damon, easy.
stay out of this, Andie. - Let her go.
are you kidding me? We just got her back.
you heard me.
I said let her go.
that's twice today you've stood in my way.
I wouldn't try a third.
you mind turning that down?
why so grumpy?
well, this body has outlived its usefulness.
do you want a drink?
no, Katerina, I don't want a drink.
come on. It might loosen you up.
what I want is for you to sit down and shut up.
maddox, what took you so long?
you've got a lot of luggage.
Greta. Finally.
Hello, love.
nice body.
you ready to get out of it?
welcome back.
tell me.
what is Klaus' curse?
please.
my family was quite close, but Klaus and my father did not get on too well.
when we became vampires, we discovered the truth.
Klaus was not my father's son.
my mother had been unfaithful many years before.
this was the darkest secret.
Klaus is from a different bloodline.
of course, when my father discovered this, he hunted down and he killed my mother's lover and his entire family.
not realizing, of course, that he was igniting a war between species that rages until this day.
a war between the species?
the vampires...
and the werewolves.
so Klaus' real father was from a werewolf bloodline?
what does that make Klaus?
a werewolf?
or a vampire?
he's both.
a hybrid would be deadlier than any werewolf or vampire.
nature would not stand for such an imbalance of power.
therefore the witches, the servants of nature, saw to it that my brother's werewolf side would become dormant.
that's the curse that Klaus wants to break?
he wants to trigger that part of him that's a werewolf.
if allowed, Klaus would sire his own bloodline.
he'd build his own race.
endangering not just vampires, - But everyone. - But you helped him.
I helped him because I loved him.
that's changed, now he must die.
we have the dagger now. We can stop him.
when a werewolf is wounded by silver,
it heals.
an original can't be killed by anything
but white oak ash on a silver dagger.
so you see the conundrum.
the dagger does not work.
what, are you saying that Klaus can't be killed?
there's one way to kill any supernatural species
at the hands of the servants of nature themselves.
a witch.
if they can channel that much power.
but it would kill them.
the curse must be broken during the full moon.
when Klaus is in transition.
that's when he'll be at his most vulnerable.
a witch with enough power...
can kill Klaus.
what if I told you that I knew a witch
that could channel that much power?
then I would tell you there's one more thing that you should know.
the full moon is tomorrow, brother.
after all these centuries, it is finally time.
I have been to see the witches.
they believe they may have found a way to spare the doppelganger.
what does it matter if she lives or not?
she's a means to an end, that is all.
what, she should die for your gain?
she is human.
her life means nothing.
I beg you to consider this.
are you so foolish as to care for her?
of course not.
love is a vampire's greatest weakness,
and we are not weak, Elijah.
we do not feel, and we do not care.
we did once.
too many lifetimes ago to matter.
tell the witches not to bother.
the sacrifice will happen as planned.
you found a way to save the life of the doppelganger?
Yes, Elena.
I did.
but unfortunately,
Katerina took matters into her own hands first.
I believe you already know how that played out.
you cared about her, didn't you?
it's a common mistake, I'm told.
and it's one I won't make again.
you don't have to be so mad at your brother.
you know, he's worried about Elena, and...
just go, please.
I know you're worried about her, too. - Andie.
go.
OK.
tired of your little play thing already?
don't start with me, Stefan.
she's just my distraction.
she's a person. You're victimizing her.
you should be thankful she's here.
she keeps me from going for what I really want.
you're right.
thank you.
for being in love with my girlfriend.
and there it is.
there it is.
you know, you can be in love with Elena all you want
if it means that you'll protect her.
but I have the one thing that you never will.
Oh, yeah?
what's that?
her respect.
stop!
what have you done?
I don't understand.
Katerina has gone. She has fled.
no.
what did you tell her? - I told her nothing.
do not lie to me!
I will find her.
you have my word.
if you do not,
I give you my word you will be dead.
now you've invited him in?
Elijah and I have renewed the terms of our deal.
Really?
the two of you will come to no harm at my hands.
I only ask for one thing in return.
what?
an apology.
a what?
I'm sorry for the part that I played in your death.
I was protecting Elena.
I will always
protect Elena.
I understand.
sacrifice is going to happen, Damon.
Bonnie will be able to kill Klaus without hurting herself
and Elijah knows how to save my life.
I told you I'd find another way.
and I did.
is that true? - It is.
and you're trusting him?
I am.
you can all go to hell.
he's angry with me right now.
but he'll come around.
perhaps.
I thought I told you to leave.
you didn't compel me.
I want to be here.
just let me be here.
I'm upset.
and you know what happens when I'm upset.
you have to leave.
no.
you need to know that somebody cares about you.
I care about you, Damon.
Hey. Look at me.
get out of here, before I kill you.
just go.
go.
now!
Elena?
now that's more like it.
you must be Elena. How do we look exactly alike?
you're a petrova doppelganger.
you're the key to breaking the curse.
elijah: Klaus is a vampire born of a werewolf bloodline.
the curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting.
but if he breaks it, he'll be a true hybrid.
Klaus wanted me to deliver a message.
the sacrifice happens tonight.
the ritual itself is relatively straight forward.
a witch will channel the power of the full moon.
to release the spell that's bound within the stone.
after that, Klaus, being both werewolf and vampire.
will sacrifice one of each.
and where do I fit into it? Klaus must drink the blood of the doppelganger.
to the point of your death.
I can't lose you. You won't.
there is another way. Damon, no!
she'll come back a vampire! How could you take that choice away from her?
she'll never forgive you.
a bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire.
so don't be his friend. Do you understand me?
[Growling]
Tyler?
without the werewolf, he can't perform the ritual tonight.
first rule always-- back up.
back up werewolf... Damon: Back up vampire.
she's in transition.
why didn't he use me? He couldn't.
what is this, Damon? A werewolf bite.
[Growling] [Caroline grunts]
Caroline, let me help! Get back, I got it!
Oh! God!
[Groaning] [growling]
[werewolf yelps]
Caroline, the door's not going to hold.
come on! Tyler, please!
[growling, whimpering]
Matt! No, hey, no! It's Tyler!
it's trying to kill us! Wait!
[Groaning]
he's wounded. Caroline, stay back.
we can go around him. Are you nuts?
you're not going to shoot him again, ok? Ok.
Matt, take my hand.
I got it.
Matt, take my hand.
so that's what a werewolf bite looks like.
Yep. It's not that bad.
will be.
so that's it?
you're just...Going to die?
well, that depends. You know anything about a cure?
me, either.
145 years and no last good-bye?
you don't get a good-bye.
no. Don't leave mad.
us ending on up on good terms isn't exactly on my bucket list, Katherine.
Klaus made me call Jenna to lure her out.
there was nothing that I could do. I didn't have a choice.
that's why I gave you the vervain. So you had a choice.
it was her or me. I chose her.
I helped you. You owed me.
now when Klaus dies, you're going to walk out of here
without a scratch and Elena's aunt dies.
somehow you're the only one that wins.
how'd that happen?
I didn't let love get in the way.
enjoy eternity alone, Katherine.
what are you going to do?
I'm going to offer myself as a replacement to Klaus.
he won't take you.
he saw your bite, he said that your blood is impure.
I'm sorry, Damon.
but Jenna's dead, there's nothing you can do about it.
[Groaning] oh, my head.
what's wrong with me?
do you remember what happened?
you called me.
you were so scared.
Oh, ah, I should have realized that it wasn't you.
the second I walked out of the house, someone grabbed me.
a vampire. Klaus.
it was Klaus.
he made me drink his blood.
and I don't...
I don't remember anything after that.
where are we? What happened?
we're at the quarry. He brought us here.
why don't I remember anything?
Jenna, do you remember...
when I told you how someone becomes a vampire?
Yeah, if you die with vampire blood in your system,
it's...
Oh, god.
he killed me. Jenna, listen to me.
listen to me, everything's going to be ok.
I'm going to get you out of here.
I'm a vampire?
Greta: And I bet you're hungry.
[Elena screams]
[grunting]
don't bother trying to get through.
I spelled the circle. You're trapped.
no matter what you do. Greta...
please, just-- just let her go.
Klaus chose her.
drink it.
Jenna, don't!
I can't. Let her go. Hey!
No!
[gasping]
[Jenna moaning]
that's enough.
it's going to be ok.
Elena: Look at me. Hey, look at me.
it's gonna be ok. It's gonna be ok.
no.
[Sighs] this is useless.
all these grimoires.
there has to be something in here to keep Elena from becoming a vampire.
and we'll keep looking.
until the last minute.
the sacrifice is completed in stages as the full moon sets.
first the werewolf is killed, then the vampire.
finally the doppelganger.
once Elena dies, the curse will be broken.
Klaus will become hybrid. So when do we attack?
Elena's death will activate his dormant werewolf side.
he'll be vulnerable during the transformation.
that's when bonnie comes in.
and you're sure bonnie will survive this?
if she can deliver him to the brink of death,
I'll finish the job myself. [cell phone rings]
Damon.
you're not going to like what I'm about to say.
cut to the chase. Is the sacrifice happening or not?
it's happening.
I tried to stop it, but it got...Complicated.
we're sticking with the original plan.
we're meeting bonnie right now.
he's got Jenna, Stefan.
what?
what is it? What's wrong?
Damon: He's going to use her as the vampire in the ritual.
Oh, my god.
Elena: How are you feeling?
I feel like myself... Only not.
everything is brighter.
the fire's hotter.
part of me is terrified,
but there's another part of me that doesn't want to feel anything.
vampires can turn off the part that's human.
that's the part that hurts.
I'm gonna die, aren't I?
No!
Jenna, I'm not going to let that happen.
I don't care what I have to do.
[twig snaps, jules groaning]
who's that?
that must be the werewolf.
[Groaning]
what's happening to me?
I cast a spell to slow down your transformation.
your insides are trying to tear themselves free.
Greta, witches are supposed to maintain the balance in nature.
it's your duty to them to keep your curse sealed.
my duty is to Klaus!
the new order.
glad to know I still have a dance partner.
Hello, my lovelies.
are we ready?
get in here!
[gasping]
do you see anything?
Matt: We're not safe here.
if that thing wants in, it's getting in.
how did you even know what I was?
I compelled you to forget!
I was on vervain.
I faked forgetting so I could spy on you.
it was your mom's idea.
wait, my mom knows?!
you told her.
well, what'd she say?
your mom hates vampires. She grew up hating vampires.
she'll probably always hate vampires.
well, what about you?
what about me?
where does this leave us?
stuck in this house.
trying not to get mauled to death by our friend.
[knock on door]
[Sighs] heard ya.
[Knocking continues]
great. I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat.
Elena hasn't returned any of my calls for days.
I need to see her.
well, you're a day late and a daughter short, John.
what are you talking about?
Klaus has her. Sacrifice goes down tonight.
how could you let that happen?
you were supposed to keep her safe.
wasn't that the sum total of your plan; to keep her safe?
she is safe. I fed her my blood.
you what?! When Klaus kills Elena In the sacrifice, she will come back to life.
granted, as the thing you hate most in the world,
but no one really cares what you think.
you do not want to mess with me right now.
you ruined her life. You know that, right?
I know, John.
I took her choice, destroyed her future.
trust me, I get it.
it actually gets worse.
how could it possibly get any worse?
[jules groaning]
I spent 500 years looking for this.
I hate to part with it.
the moon has passed its apex.
remember everything you need to do?
I remember.
[jules groaning]
[Greta chanting in latin]
everything I did...
I was just trying to help Tyler.
are you jules?
I didn't want him to be alone!
[Groaning]
shall we?
[Groaning]
[Growling]
[gasping]
Emily Bennett's has a section on spells she didFor my ancestor Johnathan Gilbert.
Yeah, I think she had a thing for him.
there's something on a resuscitative spell she was working on.
I saw that, too.
she just didn't explain what it did, exactly.
maybe Johnathan wrote about it in his journals.
you know, I can have Stefan bring them.
[Door creaking] someone's here.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Elijah and Stefan are upstairs.
you mind if I have a second with Jeremy?
sure, yeah. Of course.
what's the matter?
Jeremy...
something's happened to Jenna.
why did he take Jenna?
a punishment for meddling.
Klaus was going to use Tyler and Caroline.
but Damon rescued them. Then we need to go.
now. Before Jenna's been sacrificed.
I can kill Klaus myself. Bonnie...
if you use that much power, you'll be dead.
we've already been through this.
it's not an option.
neither is letting Jenna die.
well, Stefan would agree with you.
we're going to offer another vampire.
one that he'll want more.
me.
tell me it's working.
it's working.
the day that the lawyers called to tell me
that I was going to become your guardian, you know what my first thought was?
isn't there someone else who can do this?
Jenna, there was no one else who could have gotten me and Jeremy through all of that.
it's just the thought that I almost passed up taking care of you.
but you didn't.
you put your entire life on hold to help us.
look around, Elena.
I failed you. No.
you didn't. I failed you.
I'm so sorry.
listen.
being a vampire, it intensifies your guilt.
but it also makes you stronger and faster.
you can fight back.
I'm gonna get through this. I'll be ok.
I need you to believe that.
promise me,
when you get the chance...
run.
OK.
you don't think I killed him, do you?
no.
no. It takes a lot more than wooden bulletsTo kill a werewolf.
he's still out there somewhere.
do you think my mom wants to kill me?
I don't think your mom knows what to do with you.
Yeah, well, I don't really know what to do with me, either.
[shuffling] what is it?
wait.
[shuffling]
don't. Don't shoot.
what the hell are you doing?
Caroline: Hey.
Hey.
[gasping]
Caroline.
elijah: Bonnie did a locator spell.
they're at steven's quarry.
I'll head over there first and you'll follow with bonnie when it's time.
just as the moon hits its final phase.
she's to stay hidden until then.
he cannot know that she's alive.
you're very honorable.
are you?
because this whole plan is, um,
it's contingent upon your honor, Elijah.
I won't fail you.
Klaus is your brother.
I know I've wanted to kill my brother a thousand times.
I've never been able to.
well, Klaus was not my only brother.
I had siblings; Parents. I had a family.
over the centuries, Klaus hunted them down one by one
and he took them from me.
he scattered them across the seas where their bodies couldn't be found.
you want revenge.
sometimes there's honor in revenge, Stefan.
I won't fail you.
please end this.
I brought the Gilbert journals.
I think I know the spell you're talking about.
Bonnie: Where's Damon?
upstairs. Alaric wanted to talk to him.
he did what?!
he wasn't going to let Jenna die.
we have a witch.
she kills Klaus.
no one has to die!
except for bonnie.
God, Stefan, damn it!
Hey, are you ok?
I'm fine.
well, that's my brother for you.
always cleaning up my messes.
Hello, Jenna.
let her go.
I understand that I have to die, but she doesn't!
careful.
Elena, don't. No, Jenna!
we can't leave Jeremy without a family.
I followed your rules, I did everything that you asked.
I didn't run. Please.
well, well.
I don't recall you being on the guest list.
I'm here to talk.
very well, then.
what can I do for you, mr. Salvatore?
we found something in the Gilbert journals.
Johnathan journaled the story of a mother who called on emily's services.
the woman's baby was sick; dying.
Emily cast a spell that would bind a woman's life force with her child.
skip to the save Elena part.
well, the child died, but the mother's life force
flowed through her, restoring her to life.
we already know Elena's going to come back to life.
she'll be a vampire.
not if her soul remains intact.
Damon: Her soul, really?
you're going to put your faith in some act of god mumbo jumbo?
I refuse to let Elena become the thingI've spent my life protecting her against.
and you can call that god or mystical energy,
whatever you want, but yes...
I'm putting my faith in it.
Jenna: What's going on?
I--I don't know.
you can hear them.
your senses are heightened.
you can hear anything.
just focus on them.
you don't need to kill Jenna.
I'll take her place.
Oh, I don't know.
I rather appreciate the symmetry of three women.
three goddesses
sacrificed at nature's altar.
what are they saying?
I can't--I can't make it out.
you can do this. Just relax. Focus.
Stefan: Don't play games with me.
you'll get what you want.
I can hear him. I hear Stefan.
what are they saying?
you're quite the hero, aren't you?
I've heard that about you.
Stefan: Just make the trade.
me for Jenna.
Oh, my god.
what is it?
he wants to take my place.
[Door opens]
how's Tyler doing?
sleeping.
he should better by morning.
he just...He needs some rest.
good.
so this is your life now, huh?
never a dull moment.
you know, these last few days with you have beenSo great, and fun.
and so Caroline.
I--I thought that I might be ableTo get past this whole vampire thing.
but you can.
Matt...
I don't know if I can, Caroline.
Matt!
I get it. This is your life now.
you know what my life is, car?
my life is an absentee mom.
and a bunch of bills to pay,
and school, and a job,
and it sucks sometimes.
but it's my life.
and...
I think that I just want to live itWithout all of this.
[chanting in latin]
[Damon snaps fingers]
come on, bonnie, we got a hybrid to kill.
it's done.
that's it?
let's go.
I'll be back soon.
wait, what do you mean?
no, I'm coming. I need to be there.
I need to make sure you guys are ok.
and who's going to make sure you're ok?
I've got my own ring.
look, I'm not taking no for an answer.
just go. I'll stay with him.
it's time. All right.
I got the weapons in the car.
Bonnie's the only weapon we need.
Ahh!
Bonnie! What is this?
I can't put anyone else at risk.
I can't stay here with Jenna out there!
I'm sorry.
you can't do this! Damon?
sorry, buddy. She's right.
No! You can't do this.
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Elena... I have to do something.
this can't happen. None of it.
Klaus: Quite the predicament.
you know, it's funny,
all this talk about preserving family,
and here's Stefan,
granting your wish.
[Sighs] Stefan...
it's ok.
well.
who's it going to be, Elena?
no.
Oh, don't worry.
there's actually no choice.
Aahh! No! Stefan!
[Groaning] no!
I have other plans for your boyfriend.
I want him alive.
but for now...
[bones cracking]
[gasping]
whenever you're ready, Greta.
no.
your turn. No, Jenna, no!
it's over, Elena.
I know what I have to do.
[Gasps]
Aah! No!
[Groaning]
[All gasping]
just turn it off.
Jenna.
turn it off.
you won't be scared anymore.
No! Jenna!
No! Jenna!
[Groaning]
no.
[Greta chanting in latin]
I'm so sorry.
are they going to kill him?
Yes.
it's time.
[Groaning]
thank you, Elena.
Ah, go to hell.
[Groaning]
no.
I can feel it.
it's happening.
[bones cracking, groaning]
Yes, yes!
[Screaming]
[bonnie chanting in latin]
No!
you were dead!
[Yelling in latin]
[Screaming]
wake up, Elena!
[Groaning]
I need you to get her out of here!
what about you?
I'm not leaving until he's dead.
go.
[chanting in latin]
Elijah?
Hello, brother.
in the name of our family, Niklaus...
I didn't bury them at sea!
their bodies are safe.
if you kill me, you'll never find them.
Stefan: Elijah!
don't listen to him.
Klaus: Elijah.
I can take you to them.
I give you my word... Brother.
do it and I'll take you both out.
you'll die. I don't care.
I'm sorry. No!
No!
[Sighs] we should have heard from them by now.
did you read all this?
I did.
so you understand what happened to the child's mother after the baby was brought back to life.
she saved her daughter.
she found peace.
John...
I need you to give this to Elena for me.
and also this.
Oh, hey, what's going on?
[Sighs]
take care of each other.
please.
[Door opens] I think they're here!
if you come back as a vampire, I'll stake you myself.
so don't do it.
because I can't stand the idea of you hating me forever.
how is she?
I don't know yet.
what about Jenna?
no.
I'm sorry, Jeremy.
[gasping] Elena!
Hey! [gasping]
what happened?
how do you feel?
I feel fine.
[Exhales]
Ahh.
Hey.
Ohh.
Ooh, yeah, you got shot.
[Groaning] but it's healing.
you were right.
I shouldn't have come home.
no, you just...
should have never left.
and you shouldn't leave again.
you're kidding, right?
this is the second time I've tried to kill you.
well, no friendship is perfect.
[Both chuckle]
Matt broke up with me.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, you know, instead of just bailing on me again,
you could just say...
thank you, Caroline, "for taking care of me.
and I'm sorry that I tried to chow down on you again.
[Both laugh]
Hey. [crying]
Hey.
come here.
Ohh. Easy.
thank you, Caroline.
for taking care of me.
you're welcome.
Damon: We all set?
Stefan: Yeah.
plenty of room with the Gilbert family plot,
and I compelled two of the grave diggers to do the dirty work.
how's she doing?
she lost the only parents she had.
she's in shock.
I'm almost ready.
take your time.
[Exhales]
John wanted me to give you this.
and this.
Jeremy...
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry that you've lost so many people.
I still have you.
[Music playing]
John: "Elena...
"it's no easy task being an ordinary parent to an extraordinary child.
I failed in that task.
and because of my prejudices, I failed you."
"I'm haunted by how things might have played out differently
if I'd been more willing to hear your side of things.
[Music playing]
for me, it's the end.
for you, a chance to grow old and someday do better "with your own child than I did with mine.
it's for that child that I give you my ring."
I don't ask for your forgiveness "or for you to forget.
I ask only that you believe this."
[Music playing]
whether you are now reading this as a human or as a vampire, "I love you all the same.
as I've always loved you, and always will.
John."
[Music playing]
we're going to head back to the house.
I think I'll skip the coffee and tea cakes.
Damon, she needs us right now.
all of us.
and then what's the plan, Stefan?
the curse is broken.
how does one go about killing an all-powerful wolf vamp and his two-faced older brother?
I have no idea.
you need to get an idea. Fast.
we will. I'm not going to let Elena lose anybody else.
I wouldn't make any promises, brother.
what's that supposed to mean?
Tyler lockwood bit me.
it's actually more of a nip, really,
but there it is.
we'll find something.
a cure.
there's no cure, Stefan.
we kept Elena human, right?
we found the way when there was no way.
Hey.
I will do this.
you want to do something for me?
keep this from Elena.
last thing she needs is another grave to mourn.
does Elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar?
I've heard about you.
the crazy, impulsive vampire.
in love with his brother's girl.
I wanted you to have this.
Oh, my god, it's beautiful.
I can't give up on you, Stefan.
it's done. I don't want to see you.
I don't want to be with you.
daddy?
I'm conditioning you to associate vampirism with pain.
Hello, Bill.
a hybrid out to make more hybrids?
so what am I doing wrong?
we'd have to contact the witch who created it.
well, that would be the original witch.
bring me Rebekah. She has what I need.
time to wake up, little sister.
it's beautiful. - A witch gave it to me.
what do you have that Gloria needs?
Where's my necklace?
tell me that's not what she needs!
there has to be more to this dress.
there's not.
so women in the 21st century dress like prostitutes, then.
you know, I got dirty looks for wearing trousers.
you wore trousers so women today could wear nothing.
and what is this music? It sounds like a cable car accident.
it's dance music.
you would dance to this?
are we done?
and why are you so grumpy?
I needed one thing from you for my witch to find out why my hybrids are dying, one thing.
your necklace. And you lost it.
I didn't lose it. It's just been missing for 90 years.
so what do you think?
I like it.
what? I said I like it.
I can always tell when you're lying, Stefan.
nice one, good work.
you're the one that pulled the dagger out of her.
I heard that.
all right. I'm going to get some fresh air.
I just don't know why you want to bring chili to a potluck.
everybody brings chili.
Hey, Ric. What's up?
what time do you want to go to the Lockwood party?
Ah. Those founders parties aren't really my thing.
show up, there's going to be nine other people that brought chili.
it's an old family recipe, ok?
Yeah! I know. I knew your old family.
they made sucky chili.
why are you here, exactly? - She knows.
he thinks I'm going to break.
I'm not going to break. I am just going to keep making chili, pretend like I didn't just spend the entire summer looking for someone who didn't want to be found.
she's in denial. - I'm not in denial.
no?
you're still wearing this necklace.
isn't this the reminder of your unbreakable bond with Stefan?
what the hell are you doing here?
you two look chummy.
Klaus your new bestie?
you know, if he finds out you're in Chicago, you're dead.
happy to know that you still care.
so tell me if I'm wrong.
Rebekah's necklace that Klaus is looking for that's the necklace that you gave to Elena.
Bye, Katherine.
Hey, hey. Wait.
you're up to something, tell me.
they don't know where the necklace is.
I just have to keep them from figuring it out.
I have it all under control.
please tell me you have a better plan than that.
you do.
come on, Stefan.
you're not the diabolical type.
whatever you're planning, it's not going to work.
well, if the most diabolical woman I know can't seem to figure it out, then I must be doing something right.
I forgot. You're bad now.
don't get too cocky.
Klaus is smarter than you. He's smarter than everyone.
and I've heard about that sister.
be careful.
she'll ruin you.
happy to know you still care.
Jeremy.
Anna!
you heard me? - What are you doing here?
wait, like heard me, heard me, or did it sound more like a...
where have you been? - I need to know you can hear me.
you drop in, you tell me not to trust Vicki, and then you disappear?
Jeremy! Tell me you can hear me.
Yeah, yeah, I can hear you, all right?
what the hell!
what is it?
I've been trying to get you to hear me for days.
yelling your name and screaming. - You have?
what changed?
I've been trying to get through to you, why now?
I was dreaming about you.
I...
you were dreaming about me?
I can't believe this is actually happening.
that you're actually here.
I'm here.
I come bearing gifts.
please say that's not chili.
Bonnie!
I'm back! - Hi!
I leave town for the summer and everything goes to hell for the both of you.
Bonnie!
Jeremy!
so mayor Lockwood called your gay ex- husband to torture your vampire daughter.
Yes. I've been keeping him detained to make sure the vervain's out of his system.
so you could, you know...
can't we just kill him?
no, Damon! He's Caroline's father.
he sounds like a douchebag to me.
Yeah, well, just 'cause you and I are on ok terms doesn't mean that I'm a suddenly a big advocate for your "lifestyle."
is that what you told him when you two got divorced?
double check him for vervain before you compel him.
you brought another vampire into this?
it's the best thing for all of us, Bill.
so, Bill, I hear you're into the whole daddy- daughter vampire torture thing.
I was trying to help her.
well, if there's anyone who doesn't need help, it's your annoying control freak of a daughter.
Yep.
he's vervain-free.
just erase his memory, Damon.
so, Bill, I have a question.
what makes you think that you can change the basic nature of a vampire?
the mind's a powerful tool.
it can be trained and retrained.
you just have to be strong enough.
Oh, yeah? I completely agree.
I actually happen to love mind control, myself.
you will leave town immediately.
all you remember is you came to bring your daughter back to school shopping.
you left us.
Yeah, sorry.
retail therapy was making my head explode.
tell me about it.
what's she doing? - She's failing.
it's hard to find something when you don't have anything to go on.
so use me.
I only wore it for a thousand years.
see? Now this one offers a solution.
all right, give me your hand, sweetheart.
she's, uh, she's looking for the necklace, huh?
the problem with my dad's normal side of the family is normal made for a really boring summer.
after the last few days, I would kill for a normal family.
since when did you learn how to cook?
Damon helped a little.
Damon's helping you cook now?
both of you stop judging.
he's just trying to be a good -- ow!
Ahh! Did I splash you?
no, no, my necklace.
I can sense something.
it burned me.
maybe it's a sign you shouldn't be wearing it.
Caroline... - What, I'm just saying.
if you're going to be "cooking" without Stefan.
let me see it.
I found it.
so where is it? - It doesn't work like that, doll.
I get images.
there's a girl with her friends.
Yes, a dead girl with dead friends, if I don't get my necklace back.
well, I'll have to dive back in to get the details.
so dive. - I need more time and space.
you're harshing my ju-ju.
we can wait.
I'm sure you can.
but that's not what I asked.
Hey, you know, why don't we just come back later.
I'm hungry anyway.
I'll let you pick who we eat.
Hey. Ok, I got it.
I have an identification spell that might be able to tell me what magic affected the necklace.
it's going to take a while, so tell me if anyone's coming, ok?
so you're not, like, switching Salvatores, are you?
what?
Caroline... - Stay focused.
as your friend who worries for you daily, what is the deal with you and Damon?
there is no deal.
he's been just as focused on finding Stefan as I have.
Yeah, but that doesn't make him any less Damon.
if my own father, who I love dearly, can't change me?
no one's changing Damon.
not even you.
look, why are we even talking about this?
Hey. Guys?
what are you doing? - I'm not doing anything.
it has its own magic.
I'm going to let you in on a little secret, founders parties are just an excuse for the council to gather in back rooms and plot against vampires.
I think you need to take a beat with Elena.
excuse me?
whatever it is you two have going on, I think it's a bad idea.
I don't really think it's your problem, Ric.
it is my problem. I'm supposed to look after her, and this is me doing that.
what do you think I'm doing?
what I think is you need to take a beat.
Damon? Sorry.
uh, the mayor just called the council meeting.
my girl's dead. I'm bored.
you weren't kidding about being hungry.
Yeah.
it's been a long day.
try being related to her. - You're being mean.
and why are you being mean? You used to love me.
it's been 90 years, Rebekah. Give him a minute.
why are you taking his side?
because, my dear sister, I feel pity for any man who doesn't give you what you want.
will you stop making me out to be a brat?
I am not a brat!
a thousand years of life experience says otherwise.
well, you're no picnic, either.
I mean, I've only spent one summer with you and I feel like I want to blow my head off.
fantastic.
I need to go.
Where's he going? - To write a name on a wall.
it's a long story.
Anna?
look, where are you? We don't have much time.
we've got all the time in the world.
I'm sorry about before. I just got, um, distracted.
it's fine. I get it.
why haven't you told her?
well, she's been gone all summer.
Yeah, I know that.
now why haven't you told her, really?
I don't know. You know, I don't even understand how any of this is possible.
well, it's kind of a push and pull.
I'm pushing from the other side trying to contact you, and sometimes, like just now, if you pull...
the other side? Is that...Is that what it's called?
that's what I call it.
I'm all by myself here.
it's like I'm a part of your world, only no one can see me. I'm just on the other side.
wait, what about Vicki?
whenever you say you see her, I feel something.
a darkness.
and when I try to tell you not to let her in, something crazy happens.
like, she's trying to push me out.
like the windows breaking.
just be careful.
try not to let her in.
cause she can't get through if you're not open to it.
you don't understand how amazing it is to finally be able to talk to you.
I'm all by myself here. I mean, I don't have anyone.
I'm sorry.
I know you can't feel anything.
do it again.
there you are.
thought you were resting.
well, now we both have a secret.
what did you see?
it's what I heard that's interesting.
you know, the girls with the necklace, they were talking about you.
yet you didn't tell Klaus.
Why?
cause I wouldn't help that hybrid half-breed with anything.
the necklace is a talisman from the original witch herself.
I want it.
well, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
don't be difficult.
you know, I'd hate to have to tell Klaus what a liar his sidekick is.
guess I've got to get it out of you the hard way, huh?
what is this?
why can't I move?
relax. It's just a little paralysis spell.
nothing major.
just got to get the information out of your pretty little head.
you know, witches now days, they're into that new age stuff, but I'm a little more old school voodoo.
this will stop that pesky healing.
I won't tell you anything.
you don't have to.
you feel that?
that's your essence.
your spirit. It lets me make a connection.
herbs help, too.
Diviner's sage, witch hazel.
but my personal favorite vervain.
there have no been no incidence of question since spring.
it's been quiet.
anyone else have anything to add to the minutes?
Damon?
Ah, no, I think the sheriff covered it, mayor Lockwood.
looks like we've made it through the worst.
well, I have nothing new to add, so thank you all for coming.
good to see you.
Carol. - Damon.
I have a question.
bill.
do you three think that everybody on the council is clueless or just stupid?
OK, tell me if you see anything in these grimoires that involves precious medals or a symbol that resembles a necklace.
well, can't you just ask all the dead witches you were channeling?
I don't have access to them anymore.
they cut me off. - Since when?
since I brought you back to life.
I messed with the balance of nature and there were consequences.
Hey. I'm sorry.
I know I should have told you.
I told Elena when it happened.
I just didn't want you to feel weird about it, you know?
Hey, no, no, look, you don't have to apologize for anything.
OK? You didn't do anything wrong.
Elena said you've been having kind of a hard time since then.
no, I'm fine. You know, just been, ah, a little out of it lately.
so should I concentrate on the older books?
or, uh, I mean, how old is this necklace?
old. Yeah.
Jeremy. The darkness. It's here.
Jeremy!
are you OK?!
what the hell just happened?
I have no idea.
I'm impressed.
you've got discipline, Stefan.
it's not going to do you much good, but just let go, honey.
there we go, there we go.
there's the girl with the necklace.
you love her.
you'd do anything for her, and you have.
a lot of darkness, a lot of guilt.
all to keep her away from Klaus.
why would he be interested in one girl?
don't do this. Don't do this.
she's the doppelganger.
she's supposed to be dead, and that's why Klaus can't make hybrids, isn't it?
well, this is creepy.
maybe you do need my help, after all.
did Stefan ever tell you where he got the necklace?
no, and I never asked.
hopefully Bonnie will be able to figure it out.
please tell me it's time to go.
beyond. Where's Damon?
probably off somewhere doing bad things to good people.
consider me the honesty please.
what is it? - What's the matter?
it's my dad.
why would he even show up here?
I don't know. But I can't...
I get it.
I'll call you later. - Ok.
OK, what's that all about?
speaking of doing bad things to good people...
wait, wait, Houston, we have a problem.
where have you been? - Managing Bill Forbes.
apparently he's impervious to compulsion.
how? - I have no idea.
but he threatened to out me.
don't get me started on the irony of that.
what did you do to him?
how do you know the compulsion doesn't work?
that's not the most important piece of information I mentioned, Elena.
what does he want?
he wants to control the council.
says it's been compromised. - It has!
he wants to put vervain in the town's water supply.
maybe it's not a bad idea.
I mean, it'll help you keep yourself in control.
now that Stefan's not here to-- To what?
to keep me in check? Make me behave?
I should have killed him this morning.
he's Caroline's dad, Damon. - Yeah, and when I kill him, she'll have one more parent than we do.
Oh, come on, Damon!
you're repeatedly killing my buzz today, Ric.
step aside. - Yeah, it's not going to happen.
your temporary funeral.
Damon, no!
what is wrong with you?!
I've been thinking about your diabolical plan.
Oh. Do tell.
well, you must know that Klaus is too paranoid to ever fully trust you.
but the sister, she loves you like it was yesterday.
she's the easier mark.
but you can't just pretend to care, because Klaus will know better.
so you do the opposite.
you bond with him; make her feel left out.
that will only make her want you more.
Oh! So you mean, I'm, uh, I'm taking a page out of the Katherine Pierce playbook.
the only question is why, Stefan?
I mean, I get it, you want to keep Klaus away from Mystic Falls, but what else do you expect to get from it?
you know what's funny?
you keep talking to me like I actually trust you enough to tell you anything.
Oh, come on, Stefan, we're beyond that.
I saved you from hilda the high voodoo priestess.
OK.
I knew them, back in the twenties.
they were running from someone.
someone who scared them.
the hunter.
I heard stories about him centuries ago.
don't you want to know why an original vampire who can't be killed is afraid of a vampire hunter?
if you're planning on making a move against Klaus, I want in.
that's good.
it's good to want things, Katherine.
Stefan...
Katherine.
I'm in this alone.
if you're looking for a diabolical partner in crime, I suggest you look elsewhere.
how was football practice?
what are you doing here?
hiding out from my dad.
he's here.
are you OK?
do you want me to kick his ass?
Yes.
no.
I bought him the shirt he's wearing, it is really expensive.
and through everything he's still my dad.
you know?
God, you reek! - What?
that is bad. - No, this?
this is sexy. - No! It's really bad.
no.
Oh! Hang on, my phone.
Oh, come on!
I'm only answering in case it's a friend emergency.
it's an emergency.
whoa, whoa. Is that Scotch?
I figured you for an abstainer.
everything in moderation.
keeps the mind clear from influence.
like vampire compulsion.
Yeah, I tried to tell you.
Yeah, yeah, powerful tool. Got it.
I'm impressed.
can't say I've ever seen that before.
well, it takes a certain human focus.
it's a skill that I've been honing for decades.
Plus, your technique... is a little lazy.
duly noted.
I'm curious.
why not just expose us to the council?
I know you think I'm the bad guy here, Damon, but I would never expose my own daughter to those morons.
it's a pretty risky move, taking me on, don't you think?
I knew what I was risking when I didn't leave town, but I figured you're not self destructive enough to kill the sheriff's ex-husband.
makes you the third person to underestimate me today.
you know, with all this behavioral modification going on around here, I almost forgot how good blood tastes when it's... fresh.
what are you going to do?
kill everybody who discovers your secret?
no, I'm not going to kill you, Bill.
I'm just going to find pleasure in perfect little moments like this.
daddy! Are you OK? - I'm fine.
here. It'll heal you.
I said I'm OK. - Grow up.
let me teach this ass-wheel a life lesson.
just get out of here. - Or what?
I'm stronger than you, little girl.
well, I'm angrier!
bummer.
I love a good girl fight.
you can't do this anymore, Damon.
not in this town.
not around me. - Why not?
it's nothing I haven't done before.
why is it suddenly so important for everyone to keep me in check?
because I don't want you to be what other people think that you are.
what? A monster?
sorry to disappoint you, Elena, but last time I checked, I was still a vampire!
I guess I wish that you didn't have to act like one!
I am not Stefan.
how about you stop trying to turn me into him?
Hey, Jeremy.
there's ashes everywhere.
I'll go grab the vacuum. - No, I got it.
are you ok?
don't. - What?
Bonnie's here, ok? You've got to stop.
I was just trying to warn you.
I felt something bad. Dangerous.
you--you just can't pop up every time she and I are together.
it's a two-way street, Jeremy.
I only pop up when you're thinking about me.
that's why you haven't told her.
isn't it?
you don't want her to know you still care.
I can't do this right now.
I can't. This is just too much.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
good-bye, Anna.
don't! Jeremy, please.
don't shut me out.
what's wrong?
you asked me before if something was wrong and I said no.
yeah?
that was a lie.
I was lying to you.
when you brought me back to life...
say you can hear me, Jeremy.
please!
something happened.
I am all alone!
you're back.
finally.
Nik went to check on the witch.
dreary, isn't it?
the family cargo. Hmm.
why don't you undagger them?
because he would hunt me down and kill me.
he's a vindictive little bastard, my brother.
but you still care about him. Why?
well, I hated him for a long time.
it was exhausting.
you know, when I met you two, you were both on the run.
also exhausting.
who were you running from?
what do you mean? - Last night I saw you, there was a man looking for you.
you both seemed afraid.
I just--I wouldn't think Klaus would be afraid of anybody.
no one in this world is truly fearless, Stefan.
not even Niklaus.
who was that man?
I can't. Please.
if Nik knew we were talking about this, he would...
no, no, no, I'm sorry.
just forget I asked.
OK?
he told me about the girl you loved.
the one that died.
he also told me that you're only with him because he saved your brother.
it's true.
I think he secretly admires that about you.
he'd sacrifice anything for family.
don't tell him I told you that.
your secret is safe with me.
do you think you'll ever love anyone like you loved that girl?
one day, maybe.
I can always tell when you're lying, Stefan.
what? I'm not
don't bother. Your kiss already gave you away.
Gloria's gone.
she's cleared out.
we need to find a new witch immediately.
what's going on?
something's wrong. He was asking about Michael.
he's not with us, Nik. I can sense it.
she's wrong.
Klaus...
wake up.
it took a bit longer than usual, huh?
might want to get that ring checked.
hope it's not going bad.
you killed me.
you pissed me off.
you killed me!
Ric, no hard feelings, all right? I was on a bit of a tear.
everyone was trying to tell me how to behave.
well, maybe they finally realized you're just a dick.
I'm not going to say I told you so.
thank you. - But I did tell you.
OK, you and Damon were both right.
I was trying to change him.
but if he wants to be in my life...
wait. I...
it's been a long week, so I'm just going to be blunt.
it doesn't matter what he does, Damon's gotten under your skin.
that's not true.
God, just admit it, Elena, ok?
you are attracted to him!
in all of his bad brother glory.
no.
wait, no, you're not attracted to him, or no, you just won't admit it?
I can't, Caroline!
if I admit it, if I even thought it for just a second, what does that say about me?
it says you're human, Elena.
do you need me to... - No, I got it.
don't worry, I'm going to go back home before somebody kills me.
how's your...
Oh, healed. See?
thank you.
for coming to my rescue.
you're welcome.
Bye, Caroline.
daddy.
I'm going to be ok.
you're a vampire, sweetheart.
I don't think you'll ever be ok again.
I understand where you're coming from, but the Gilbert family is a founding family, and they deserve to have a voice on the council.
I've taken care of them, I should be that voice.
that's not the way it works, Mr. Saltzman.
Oh, really? Well, then tell me how it does.
the council's job is to protect the people of this town.
now your daughter's a vampire and your son's a werewolf.
so who's looking after the actual people?
some of them may be family or friends, but they are still supernatural.
they don't follow our rules or our laws, they look after themselves, and that's what we need to do.
I'll see you at the next meeting.
hey there. I just saw Jeremy.
he said that you still have my necklace?
Yeah, I haven't figured out what's going on with it yet.
I know.
but I just--I feel weird without it.
the whole Stefan of it all.
did Jeremy also tell you that he's been seeing ghosts of his dead girlfriends all summer?
what?
Vicki and Anna. He's been talking to them.
you're kidding. - I wish.
it's because I brought him back to life.
the witches said there would be consequences.
guess they were right.
you know, what am I supposed to...
I'll accept written apologies only.
are you two lovebirds fighting already?
Katherine.
wonderful. What do you want?
I'm just a girl looking for a partner in crime.
feel like hitting the road?
getting the hell out of dodge?
impeccable timing.
I was told I need to take a beat.
is that a yes?
I'll drive.
why not?
walls are starting to close in on me around here.
where are we going?
away from here. That's all I'm going to give you for right now.
but believe me, it's good.
just give me a chance to explain myself, ok?
no need. I'm not mad, I'm just curious.
rebekah seems to think you're hold onto something.
a piece of your old life.
the thing is, she's got flawless instincts; borderline supernatural.
so I thought I would check it out.
see for myself what it is you've been hiding.
welcome back to Mystic Falls, Stefan.
you must be Elena.
how do we look exactly alike?
I killed the doppelganger.
I broke the curse.
so what am I doing wrong?
you'd have to contact the witch who created it.
that would be the original witch.
the necklace is a talisman from the original witch herself.
Hi, Katherine.
feel like hitting the road?
why not?
Rebekah. Time to wake up, little sister.
when I met you two, there was a man looking for you.
you both seemed afraid. Who was that man?
what's going on?
he was asking about Michael.
he's not with us, Nik, I can sense it.
you're holding on to something.
I thought I would see for myself what it is you've been hiding.
welcome back to Mystic Falls, Stefan.
Oh, come on! Seriously?!
do you know how long it took for us to set all this up?!
forgot about senior prank night, huh?
clearly. -- How could you forget?
we've only been waiting for this since like freshman year.
Yeah, Matt. If I'm doing this, you're doing this.
I'm kind of surprised any of you are doing this.
Caroline's making us.
we're about to be seniors.
these are the memories that stay with us forever, -- and if we don't -- and if we don't create these memories now, then what's the point of it all?
go ahead and make fun, I don't care.
you're all lame. And I've got ten more classrooms to prank.
Hey! Where are you going?
to superglue Alaric's desk shut.
I'm making memories.
I love you!
get the faculty toilet seats, and Dana needs bodies in the gym. Let's go.
there's my girl. -- Klaus!
you're supposed to be dead.
what are we going to do about that?
are you hungry? Let's stop for a bite.
a truck stop. Or a trucker.
Oh, stop being cute.
it's not possible.
we've been driving around aimlessly for hours.
where are we going?
far enough away so that you can't go running back.
not to worry. Mystic Falls and I are on a bit of a break.
you and Mystic Falls, or you and Elena?
let's just say Elena and I are having a bit of difference of opinion on how I should behave.
Ooh. Let me guess -- Elena wants you to be the hero, and you don't like playing pretend.
something like that.
her loss.
what are you doing?
I thought I'd give it a shot.
truth is, you just don't do it for me anymore.
Oh, he lives.
what happened? -- You took a beating.
my brother's been breaking your neck all afternoon.
quite the temper.
why did he bring us back to Mystic Falls?
you can stop playing dumb now.
it didn't take him long to figure out what you'd been hiding.
I'm not hiding anything.
I've done everything Klaus has asked me to.
no, you just failed to mention that the doppelganger's still alive.
where is Klaus now?
with any luck, ripping that cow's bloody head off.
where is she?
you really do love her, don't you?
consider me jealous.
you put a rather large kink in my plans, sweetheart.
the whole point of breaking the curse and becoming a hybrid was to make more hybrids.
I haven't been able to do that. Now my bet is, it has something to do with the fact that you're still breathing.
if you're going to kill me, just do it!
not until I know I'm right.
but I do have ways of making you suffer.
attention, seniors.
you have officially been busted. Prank night is over.
head on home.
you two. I remember you.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Oh, don't worry, I wasn't in my right head last time we met.
lift your foot up, please, Dana.
if she drops her foot, Chad, I want you to beat her to death.
understood?
don't, Klaus. You don't have to hurt anybody.
Oh, come on, love. Of course I do.
why are we stopping?
I thought we might want to stretch our legs.
take a break from the sexual tension.
I'm tired of driving.
it's your turn. -- Fine.
we're not going anywhere until you spill your guts.
fine.
do you recognize this, hmm?
a little birdy told me that Klaus wants to get his hands on it.
why would Klaus want Elena's necklace?
does it Matter? He wants it, and I have it.
it's leverage, Damon.
always stay one step ahead of your enemy.
I'll keep that in mind. -- But more importantly, when I stole the necklace from Bonnie,
I found out something else -- something better.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
are you willing to do whatever it takes to stop Klaus?
no turning back? -- I'm not turning back.
good. 'Cause this isn't going to win you any points at home.
Jeremy? Really?
do you think Matt's going to be ok?
I'm kissing you and you're wondering about your ex-boyfriend?
I'm asking you if you think our friend, who we both love, is OK.
I think he probably doesn't have a lot of people to talk to anymore.
I think he's struggling more than he lets on.
I think that I love how big your heart is.
I just want this school year to be great, you know?
I just want everyone to be happy.
even in the midst of all the crazy unhappy bits.
I'm happy.
you two are adorable.
uh, do we know you?
you're Caroline, Elena's friend, which makes you Tyler.
the werewolf.
and who are you?
I'm the new girl.
Caroline!
this is fun, right?
you sound like Caroline.
come on, I am embracing her philosophy.
you should be more into this.
I know. Where's Jeremy tonight?
I haven't talked to him all day.
we're having, um...
he, uh, he told me about seeing Vicki.
Ohh. Good, I'm glad that you know.
I'm sorry. Is it weird talking about your sister like this?
no, I -- I just kind of want to see her myself, you know?
I mean, I never got to say good-bye to her.
do you realize that just last summer, you and I were lifeguards at the pool?
and the only two problems I had in my life were that Elena was breaking up with me and I sucked at CPR.
everything was so different then.
Yeah. Now Elena's dating a vampire, you're a witch, my sister's a ghost, and...
I'm -- I'm just a guy who's wondering how life got so screwed up.
it's crazy, Matt.
I can't imagine what it must be like for you.
it just, uh, kind of explains why I'm not that into senior prank night.
Yeah.
I'll go grab a couple more rolls.
then we hit the gym.
I'm here, Matt.
I can help you.
keep it up.
Where's Stefan? What did you do to him?
Stefan's on a time out.
Bonnie, get out of here!
Ah, I was wondering when you'd show up.
now we can get started.
Ah, Dana, why don't you relax?
you and Chad sit tight.
I assume you're the reason Elena's still walking around alive?
that's right. If you want to blame someone, blame me.
Oh, there's no need for blame, love.
just your witchy interference seems to have caused some undesirable side effects.
and since you caused the problem,
I'm going to have you find the fix.
get off of me! -- Hush now.
I'd like you all to meet my sister Rebekah.
word of warning -- she can be quite mean.
don't be an ass. -- Leave him alone!
I'm going to make this very simple
every time I attempt to turn a werewolf into a vampire hybrid, they die during the transition.
it's quite horrible, actually.
I need you to find a way to save my hybrids, Bonnie.
and for Tyler's sake...
you better hurry.
he killed him.
he's not dead. Klaus's blood will turn him into a vampire.
and if Bonnie's successful, he'll live through his transition.
go on, then. Go and fetch your grimoires and enchantments and what-not.
I'll hold on to Elena. For safe-keeping.
so this is the latest doppelganger.
the original one was much prettier.
enough, Rebekah.
take the wolf boy elsewhere, would you?
just ignore her.
petty little thing.
what are you going to do?
I have no idea. The curse he's talking about is a thousand years old. My grimoires don't go back that far.
can you ask those dead witches that helped you before?
I don't have contact with them anymore
they cut me off when I brought Jeremy back to life.
that's it!
I can't contact the dead.
Jeremy can.
I'm listening.
what if I told you there was a way to kill Klaus?
and not dagger dead. Dead dead.
I'd say you were desperate and lying.
or drunk.
or desperate, lying and drunk.
do you remember my friend Pearl? -- Vividly.
centuries ago, she told me about a vampire who knew how to kill Klaus.
then she wouldn't tell me any more.
well, why not? -- Because it was her leverage.
she knew it was valuable information, and wouldn't share it with me.
well, this is all great...
but she's dead.
which is why I never brought it up.
because she only ever told one other person.
who? -- Her daughter.
Anna. -- Also dead.
which brings us right back around to...
me
back around to me.
Stefan...
Klaus.
come to save your damsel, mate?
I came to ask for your forgiveness.
and pledge my loyalty.
well, you broke that pledge once already.
Elena means nothing to me anymore.
and whatever you ask of me...
I will do.
fair enough.
let's drink on it.
kill them.
what are you waiting for? Kill them.
No! Stefan, don't.
he's not going to hurt me. He already said -- ahh!
she means nothing to you?
your lies just keep piling up.
let her go! I'll do whatever you want, you have my word!
your word doesn't mean much.
I lived by your word all summer, during which time I never had to resort to this
stop fighting.
don't do this, don't do this.
I didn't want to. All I wanted was your allegiance.
now I'm going to have to take it.
don't... Don't...
you will do exactly as I say
when I say it.
you will not run, you will not hide, you will simply just obey.
No!
Stefan!
now kill them. Ripper.
this isn't going to work.
I think that your witchy girlfriend's worried that you've run away with your ghostly lover.
stop with the teenybopper drama.
focus.
I'm not helping them.
no, it's ok to help.
they're looking for a way to stop Klaus.
I don't care. Katherine is not a friend to you.
neither of them are. -- What's she saying?
well, she doesn't want to help you.
my advice? Hmm?
if you want to make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs.
Jeremy, I just want you to know, it's nothing personal.
Ow! What the hell?! -- Jeremy!
Anna, I know you can hear me.
tell us what you know.
the sooner, the better for your little boyfriend here.
they're looking for Michael. -- Michael!
Michael. Is that his name?
who's Michael?
the vampire who hunts vampires.
you don't want to wake him. He will kill all of you.
what's she saying? -- Hello!
he's a vampire and a hunter,
and you guys would be idiots to wake him.
what do you mean, wake him?
it's time to go find the keys.
we didn't have mobile telephones in my day.
would have made life a whole lot easier, I suppose.
Where's Tyler?
he's dead.
ish.
what did you do to him?
think of it as he's having a nap.
when he wakes up, he'll be a hybrid.
Ugh. Vomit.
is that my neck
why is that doppelganger bitch wearing my necklace?!
it's always nice to see a vampire in his true element.
the species has become such a broody lot.
no. You did this to him.
I invited him to the party, love.
he's the one dancing on the table.
where is it?!
Where's my necklace?
what are you talking about? -- She has my necklace.
look.
well, well. More lies.
where... is it?
I don't have it anymore. -- You're lying!
knock it off!
make her tell me where it is, Nik!
Where's the necklace, sweetheart? Be honest.
I'm telling the truth.
Katherine stole it.
Katerina.
of course.
well, that's unfortunate.
if we had the necklace it would make things a whole lot easier for your witch, but since we're doing this the hard way, let's put a clock on it, shall we?
20 minutes.
if Bonnie hasn't found a solution by then,
I want you to feed again. Only this time,
I want you to feed on Elena.
you know you want to.
no, Klaus! Don't do this to him!
no one leaves. If she tries to run, fracture her spine.
did you find Jeremy?
No! I called him like 20 times.
all right, I'll grab my keys, we'll head to his house.
OK. I'll meet you by your truck.
what the hell?
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
Matt!
I can help you, Mattie, but I need you to hear me.
Vicki?
what is taking so long?
this is going to sound crazy, but I think Vicki's trying to reach out to me.
what? -- I think she can help us save Tyler.
no, Jeremy can help us save Tyler.
we can't find Jeremy. We need to try something else.
I have an idea but I'm going to need your help.
meet me at the pool. -- I don't understand.
Jeremy can see ghosts because you brought him back from the dead.
I need you to do that for me. -- What?!
no, Matt, that's crazy!
this is going to work, trust me. -- No, Matt,
I can't do that kind of magic anymore.
you don't need magic, Bonnie.
you just have to be better than I was at CPR.
don't fall asleep, Jer. You might have a concussion.
thanks for the concern, dick.
Oh, stop pouting. He took one for the team.
everyone back home will thank you once Klaus is dead.
Where's my phone?
do you need to check in with Elena?
make sure it's ok you pummeled her little baby bro?
you know you have it. -- What can I say?
I need you present here now.
Katherine, phone, now.
Bonnie's been texting me.
what is it?
it's Klaus. -- No turning back, Damon.
shut up, Katherine. -- Hey, look at the big picture.
the best shot at taking out Klaus is by finding Michael.
stay with her so Anna can guide you. I'll be back.
you're going to get yourself killed.
the Damon I remember wouldn't have been that stupid.
I wouldn't have done it for you.
Matt, please! I can't do this.
there's nothing else I can do!
Matt. Matt.
Vicki?
Matt.
please!
I can see you.
I need you to listen to me very carefully.
I don't have much time.
why, what's happening? Where are we?
it doesn't matter. I need you to give Bonnie a message.
it's OK.
you're OK.
Caroline's dad!
Stefan, he was able to resist compulsion.
I don't know how, but he did it.
maybe it's possible.
Yeah, yeah. Maybe it's just mind control, right?
maybe it just takes some focus, a couple decades of training.
no big deal. -- Stefan, you can control this.
when that buzzer goes off, just -- just drink from me.
you don't get it. I can't stop, Elena!
I'm a ripper! A ripper doesn't stop!
I listen to the words that come out of your mouth, and all I hear is the sound of your heart pumping blood through your body.
and when that clock ticks down...
I'm going to have to feed on you.
and you want to know what's worse?
I'm not going to be able to stop.
I don't believe that. You can fight it.
you just have to want it bad enough.
why, because I love you? -- Yeah!
that's right, Stefan. Because you love me.
you'll fight because after everything that we've been through, you owe me that!
you know what, you're right.
you're right. I owe you everything.
because through all of this, you are the one thing that has kept me from giving up;
from turning it all off.
but I can't help what I am, Elena.
the more blood that I get, the more I want, and if I get so much as near yours...
you are dead.
where am I? What happened?
Tyler -- Don't be shy about it.
what's going on?
Klaus is turning you into a vampire.
a hybrid.
you're in transition.
don't leave out the hard part, sweets.
you'll only survive if your witch is successful.
if not...
you're pretty much dead.
you're going to be OK.
OK? It's gonna be ok.
I wonder how she's doing.
tick tock goes the gym clock.
as soon as you're feeling better,
I'm going to kill you.
it worked. I saw her, I saw Vicki.
you did? -- She said she had a message for you.
for me? -- From the witch that put the hybrid curse on Klaus.
she said that Elena shouldn't have survived Klaus' ritual.
the hybrids can't transition because Elena's still alive.
Tyler... -- He's going to die, isn't he?
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
given the choice, doppelganger or a hybrid,
I go hybrid every time.
Elena, you're going to have run.
but Klaus said that if I run
I know what he said, but if you stay, it won't matter.
Elena, please, please, please.
Elena...
there's no other way.
there is another way, Stefan. It's for you to fight.
Stefan... I love you.
fight, Stefan. Don't give up.
I can't hold it.
Elena, run! Go!
we've got to stop meeting like this.
now this is fascinating. I've never seen this before.
the only thing stronger than your craving for blood is your love for this one girl.
why don't you turn it off?
No! -- Come on.
your humanity is killing you.
all the guilt must be exhausting.
turn it off. -- No!
Stefan... -- You're strong.
but you're not that strong.
turn... it... off.
No!
turn it off!
what did you do?
I fixed him.
but I think a test is in order, don't you?
Ripper...
perhaps you'd like a drink...
well, the verdict's in. The original witch says the doppelganger should be dead.
does that mean we can kill her?
no, I'm fairly certain it means the opposite.
What?!
call it a hunch
Elena's blood. Drink it.
No! No, no, no, Tyler, don't!
if he doesn't feed, he'll die anyway, love.
consider this an experiment.
it's OK.
there you go.
come on.
good boy.
Tyler? No!
well, that's a good sign.
where am I?
in the hospital, sweetie.
you suffered through a terrible ordeal.
I have to get out of here.
Ah. Not an option. You've lost a lot of blood.
wait...
you're taking my blood?
of course. It's very important for your friend Klaus.
no.
don't fight it, sweetie.
he told me you need plenty of rest.
so the doppelganger isn't the problem.
her blood is the solution.
seems so.
how did you know?
well, you know how much the original witch hated me.
do you honestly think I would do anything other than the opposite of what she says.
a thousand years in the grave and she's still screwing with you.
well, it makes sense if you think about it from her perspective.
it was her failsafe in case I ever broke the hybrid curse.
the doppelganger had to die in order for me to become a hybrid, but if she was dead...
then you couldn't use her blood to sire yourself a new species.
leaving me alone for all time.
is that what this is about?
your obsession with hybrids.
you just don't want to be alone?
what I want is to take my girl, take my hybrid the hell out of this one pony town.
you know, why don't you, uh,
why don't you get the truck? I'll get Elena.
well, look who finally decided to show up to the party.
where is she? -- Elena?
Ah, she's making a donation to a greater cause.
I'm afraid I can't let you interfere, mate.
you'll have to kill me.
Oh, I would love to kill you, but I made a pledge to your brother, and unlike him, I keep my word.
although, you know what, thinking about it now, he probably doesn't care that much anymore.
you don't want to know about your friend Michael?
what do you know about Michael?
just that he knows you're here.
bluffing. -- Katherine and I found him.
consider it our leverage.
Damon...
are you sure you're ok?
I'm great, Caroline.
I mean, like, phenomenal.
it's a rush. I wish I could explain it.
everything's just... better.
this is going to be an amazing year.
you ready? I could still use a ride over to Jeremy's.
Yeah, just a second.
listen to me.
I know you want to help, and I know you miss your sister.
but what you did was reckless and stupid.
I know. Bonnie.
I know.
but it worked. It was worth it.
you don't want to be a part of all this, Matt.
you are the only one of us who actually gets to live your life like a normal person.
no matter how lost you feel, don't forget that.
I get it, Bonnie.
I'll be out in a minute, all right?
Vicki's here.
watching me, and I just, uh,
I just need a minute to say good-bye, OK?
Bon, seriously,
I'm not going to do anything stupid, I just
Vickie?
Hi, Mattie.
Hey, have some bourbon.
it'll help you forget.
Yeah, it's strong.
you know I can help you forget, too.
at least the memories you don't want to keep.
no. No compulsion.
I need to remember.
all of it.
I stole it back for you.
he's really gone this time.
I watched it happen.
after everything that we went through to get -- to help him.
now he's just...
gone.
where were you, Damon?
I shouldn't have left.
I promise you...
I will never leave you again.
well, isn't this cozy?
what are you doing here, brother?
last I checked,
I live here.
Klaus is gone, but he's asked me to keep watch on you until he returns.
from now on, you're under my protection.
Mmm, by all means.
carry on.
how do you know that Anna wasn't tricking you?
this is the place.
it's the oldest wing of the largest cemetery in Charlotte.
she said that a witch entombed them here in the nineties.
look there.
the only thing stronger than your craving for blood is your love for this one girl.
turn it off.
No!
turn it off!
what did you do? -- I fixed him.
Klaus is gone.
he's asked me to keep watch on you until he returns.
from now on, you're under my protection.
it's kind of a push and pull.
I'm pushing from the other side trying to contact you, and sometimes, like just now, if you pull...
Bonnie, stop dodging my calls.
why are you thinking about me when you're calling her?
I don't think I can stop thinking about you.
who's the guy with Carol? -- Mason Lockwood.
Mason Lockwood is a werewolf.
he'd kill me the first chance he got.
[Groaning]
this is going to be fun.
[Groaning]
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
[Groaning]
hurts, doesn't it?
Oh, Stefan!
low blow, Stefan.
low blow.
what the hell happened to you?
whatever twisted ripper game this is, leave me out of it.
I didn't do this.
quit screwin' around!
I didn't. -- Ahh.
it's pretty messed up though, isn't it?
Yep.
Aaahhh! Ahhh.
Yeah, not to worry. I'll just untangle myself.
[Groaning]
[Screaming and groaning]
[Music playing]
as a long-time member of the historical society,
I am especially proud to be kicking off this day of festivities.
thank you, volunteers.
tonight, we turn off our town's lights and flare up our lanterns in honor of the Night of Illumination started by our founders 150 years ago.
here's founding family member Tobias fell with a history lesson.
what are we doing here?
tobias fell is the head of the history department.
I didn't have a choice.
all right, that explains what you're doing here.
well, I'm the one who can fail you if you don't help me out.
Hey, sorry I'm late. What did I miss?
just a bunch of historical lies.
you didn't miss anything.
the first illumination was held in celebration with the new found prosperity that Mystic Falls enjoyed after the war.
after the founders stole from all the vampires.
what's so funny?
to indicate that it was safe for their neighbors to come outside again.
safe from the vampires.
so when you did the spell to send Vicki away, did that get rid of Anna, too?
I wish. All I did was block the magic that was helping Vicki get a physical foothold here.
Jeremy's still got a direct line to the other side, and as long as he wants to see Anna and she wants to see him, she's still here.
OK, you don't think I can actually resist commenting on that.
there. You commented.
what do you want me to say, Caroline?
I went against the balance of nature when I brought Jeremy back to life, and now I'm paying the consequences.
well, I want you to say you're not ok with it.
I'm a thousand times not ok with it.
I just don't know what to do about it.
[Vehicle approaching]
greetings, blondie.
witchy. I think you got your voodoo wires all crossed when you got rid of Vicki Donovan.
what do you mean, why?
because I'm pretty sure I just got spit-roasted by Mason Lockwood's ghost. What?
and why would you think that?
maybe because he chained me to a chair and shoved a hot poker in my chest.
I thought you said that ghosts couldn't physically interact with people.
they can't. -- Yeah, well,
I don't have time for a vengeful Lockwood.
when I kill someone, they're supposed to stay dead.
whatever you screwed up, fix it.
Hey, Jer, I need you to help me with something.
what's up?
I've been going through Stefan's old journals.
every single time that he's gone off the rails in the past, his best friend Lexi's been the one to bring him back.
so where is she now that we need her?
she's dead.
and you want me to try to reach her, don't you?
I thought if I knew how she did it, maybe I could help him.
I don't even know if she's on the other side.
is that what it's called?
that's what Anna calls it.
there's not like an official brochure or anything.
so what is it, like some sort of supernatural purgatory?
well, Anna said it's like being here with all of us, only we can't see her or hear her.
and she can't interact with anyone.
she's all alone.
Vicki could interact. She blew up my car.
Vicki had help from a witch on the other side.
Anna... She's doing this all by herself.
I'm just saying, maybe we learned our lesson about summoning dead people.
I haven't seen Vicki, I swear.
I sent her back like you told me to.
are you sure?
because she has just as much reason to haunt Damon as Mason Lockwood does.
she's gone, Bonnie. If she was here, I'd know it.
why do you think it's Vicki and not Mason?
because if any ghost other than Vicki Donovan has a physical foothold on our side, then that means Damon's right and something has gone really, really wrong.
I've had enough of this ghost stuff to last forever.
so you guys can leave me out of this one.
I feel so sad for him.
it took a lot for him to send his sister away.
Yeah.
so much strength as a man.
I've got a ghost problem to deal with, Caroline.
save the Jeremy lecture for later.
[Sighs]
OK, did your grimoire just...
I think so.
OK, please tell me that's a recipe for witch cookies.
it's a manifestation spell.
it's used to reveal veiled matter.
what's veiled matter?
ghosts.
do you think it's even possible to contact Lexi?
I don't know.
I didn't have an emotional connection with her.
I never even met her. -- Can we just drop it, please?
no, I can't drop it, Ric. I don't know what else to do.
don't you think we have a few too many dead vampires in our past to be sitting here thinking of them watching us?
I don't think all supernatural spirits go to the other side.
I think some of them find peace.
is Anna here right now?
don't tell her I'm here. She won't like it.
no, no. I'm going to go, uh, check my work schedule.
Hey, guys.
who forgot to invite me to the family summit?
hmm?
[Sighs]
Wow.
all these words.
I forgot how much I used to care.
I didn't.
you know, Elena, it's probably best you not torture yourself with memories from the past.
it's best we both just move on and accept things as they are.
you don't have to be here, Stefan.
you know what, Alaric, you're right. I don't.
but Elena's here, and I look out for Elena.
besides, there's going to be people everywhere tonight.
so there's going to be lots to eat.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
loosen up.
I can't drop it, Ric.
so this is where you brought Jeremy back to life.
Yeah.
sorry, I know it's creepy, but we needed a private place around here to do the spell.
hmm. There's no chance it's haunted by the hundred dead witches who were horrifically burned to death in this very spot, is there?
they're not here anymore.
and they made it clear they were never coming back.
right.
a pinkie swear?
what's wrong?
why did you tell me to lie?
Elena is Bonnie's best friend.
she won't like what's going on between us.
what is going on between us?
OK, how are we able to touch?
Vicki had to use magic to do that.
I don't know. Honestly, I have no idea.
this witch on the other side that gave Vicki her foothold, is she helping you now?
what? No!
I'm all alone, Jeremy, I told you that.
swear to me.
I swear.
I'm not any danger to you or anybody, I promise.
Hey.
I need you to believe me.
I shouldn't even be talking to you.
this is not OK.
then send me away.
I'm only here because you want to be with me as much as I want to be with you.
send me away, Jeremy.
it's that easy.
I don't know why this is happening or when it's going to stop.
but before it's done...
I have to do this.
[Sighs] Ready?
do you need me to do...
[Chanting in latin]
right. OK.
[Exhales]
[Chanting continues]
I'll grab Jeremy.
I'll be right back.
you know, I've had enough vampires today, thanks.
Oh, come on. Have a drink with me. We've got trouble.
no, you've got trouble. See, we're not a team.
you tried to kill me. All right? We're not friends.
I don't like you anymore. -- Ah!
but remember back when you liked me and we conspired to kill Uncle werewolf Mason Lockwood?
Yeah, and?
I think he's still a little pissed.
[Chanting in latin]
Bonnie, I don't like this.
[Chanting continues]
Bonnie...
[Wind blowing]
Oh, my God. Is that your...
grams.
Anna?
Lexi.
Mason! -- God, I miss whisky.
Ahh! Ow.
told ya.
Hi.
you're dead. -- Well, technically, so are you.
then how the hell can I see...
see me? Yeah, I have no idea.
and I have no idea how long it's going to last, so let's get right to the point.
you're off the rails. Big time.
look, I don't know how you're here, but you need to leave me alone, OK?
now what kind of a friend would I be if I didn't help you out of this mess you're in?
I don't want your help.
you know, you say that every time.
I don't want your help, I don't want to get better, leave me alone.
well, maybe you should listen this time.
or maybe I should do this.
[Bonnie crying]
I can't believe you're here!
now stop your crying, we don't have time for tears.
nice to see you again, Caroline.
Hi, Miss Sheila.
a fine mess you've made, honey.
the witches told you there'd be consequences to bringing Jeremy back and you did it anyway.
I didn't have a choice.
I love him and I... I couldn't just let him go.
I understand.
but you cracked open the door to the other side.
there's an old witch over here. She took advantage of it.
she took advantage of you, honey.
when you did that spell to send Vicki Donovan away, she wedged the door wide open.
giving a free pass to anybody with unfinished business.
how do you know this? -- Witches talk.
even on the other side.
who do you think makes all the rules?
what does the witch want?
that's original vampire business, not yours.
I don't want you getting in the middle of that.
I'm here because you upset the balance of nature.
and it's your duty to set it right.
you need to close that door.
how do we do that?
apparently the old witch can draw power from this side because of her talisman.
talisman... My necklace?
it's some juju power source.
and I know you're not going to like this, but Bonnie needs to destroy it.
I just walked in on Jeremy kissing the reason
I'm completely OK with that.
What?! Are you kidding?
I wish. Look, I don't have the necklace.
Damon has it somewhere.
text him. I'll call you right back.
Elena... -- You need to disappear or evaporate or whatever it is that you ghosts do.
Hey, it's not her fault.
you're right, it's yours.
how did this happen?
I don't know. OK? I don't know.
it just... it did.
Elena, please.
you can't tell Bonnie.
[Sighs] Don't worry. I'm going to let you do that.
right after I help her send the ghosts away.
looks like today was a good day to be thinking about me, Elena.
Lexi? -- Mm-hmm. Come with me.
where?
Ripper detox 101. Crash course.
I...
I'm sorry, did you not just say how desperate you were for my help in saving Stefan's life?
let's go.
I am never going to hear the end of that damn necklace.
one of you will pay for this, right?
Cheers.
let's get to it. I killed you.
you want revenge. Get in line.
actually, I want an apology.
[Laughs]
good luck with that.
don't you have a family to haunt?
you know your nephew has turned into a mindless hybrid minion.
that's why I'm here. To help Tyler.
[Scoffs] Well, sorry to break it to you, buddy, but Tyler can't be helped.
at least not while Klaus is alive.
which is, like, always.
not necessarily.
not if you found a weapon that could kill him.
there is no weapon that...
what do you know?
I know you need to apologize.
you got to be kidding me.
are you incapable of remorse? Just apologize!
you're right.
I didn't have to kill you.
I do a lot of things I don't have to do.
[Laughs]
that's good enough.
meet me at the old Lockwood cellar.
bring a shovel.
and come alone.
what, you're going to bury me alive?
don't tempt me.
[Music playing]
[Indistinct chatter]
Klaus really did a number on him, huh?
he compelled him to turn off his humanity.
well, we're just going to have to convince him to turn it back on.
I have to warn you, it's not going to be pretty.
I can handle it.
wake up, sleepyhead.
how you feelin'?
[Chuckles] What is this?
let me out of here! -- Shh.
inside voices, please.
I'm trying to get inside your head.
[Chuckles] Elena.
get rid of her, please.
no.
first step, drying him out.
starve away the blood lust.
strip away the temptation.
[Laughs] This isn't going to work, Lexi.
you can't do this.
you heard the not pretty part?
I heard you.
what are you doing?
[gasping]
[Groaning]
what are you doing, Lexi?!
doing what I do best, sweetness.
I'm saving your life.
[Grunting and groaning]
I'm surprised you showed.
you put a snag in my only other Klaus lead.
so I'd say I'm highly motivated.
Mikael? -- Yeah.
that didn't turn out so great, did it?
how do you know so much?
there's not much to do on the other side but sit around and watch other people screw things up.
what are we looking for?
there's an old Lockwood family legend about a weapon that can kill an original vampire.
like the rest of their secrets, they kept it buried.
Oh, come on, give me the thing.
move.
I got it.
[Grunts]
go for it.
you first.
what, you think I'm leading you into a trap?
the thought crossed my mind.
[Groaning] I'm starving. I'm starving.
I'm starving! Let me out!
let me out. Please let me out.
what's happening? -- He's hallucinating.
that's three months without any blood.
let me out! -- Now he's at nine months.
[Groans]Two years...
five.
did I ever tell you how glad I am that you're dead?
Oh. I missed you, too, friend.
[Cell phone rings]
[Ring]
[Stefan groaning] Hello?
so the necklace isn't where Damon said it would be and now we can't reach Damon.
listen, I need you to get Bonnie to hold off on sending the ghosts back.
What?!
but you said you were in full support of getting rid of them. I was.
I am. Look,
Lexi's here and she's helping with Stefan.
OK, let's just find it first and then we'll choose between boyfriend ghost dramas.
what are you talking about?
um... Lexi's back, so Elena wants us to hold off on destroying the necklace.
you said boyfriend dramas. Plural.
what is it, Caroline?
Elena caught Jeremy kissing Anna.
what?
I'm sorry.
he kissed her?
she's got a foothold now, so she probably thinks that she's here to stay.
but you and I, Bonnie, we're going to find that necklace.
OK?
OK.
sorry.
Hey, man sorry about that.
no problem, buddy.
have you seen Tobias Fell?
he's supposed to do the lighting ceremony.
no.
well, well.
Frederick? -- If it isn't pearl's daughter.
little Annabelle.
good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Fell seems to have been detained, so the history department's very own Mr. Saltzman has agreed to fill in.
[Applause]
still hanging around the Gilbert kid, huh?
I guess you forgot the fact that his family killed you and your mother.
there you are.
is everything all right?
ask your ancestors.
what are you doing here, Frederick?
well, it's a founder's celebration.
and we...
have got some unfinished busines with the founding families.
on behalf of Mystic Falls high school historical society, let's light 'em up.
[cheers and applause]
[Woman screaming]
[All yelling]
[gasping]
I'm hurting. Please help me.
don't listen. Shut him out.
I am helping you, Stefan.
I'll do anything. I'll change. I promise.
it's a lie. He'll say anything right now.
Elena, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Just make it stop.
please, just make it stop.
you have to separate yourself from your emotions.
don't let him play with them.
Hey, look at me. Look at me.
Elena. I love you, OK?
I love you.
I love you so much.
I love you so much, Elena.
I'm sorry, Stefan, I just don't believe you.
you know what?
I don't want your help, anyway.
I wish I'd never met you.
every single moment that I've spent with you has been a complete and total waste.
you see that? That's the ripper talking.
once he's weak enough, you have to cause him pain.
make him feel things.
anger, rage, anything.
you have to make him see past the blood.
[Screaming and groaning]
think of it as a regimen.
day in and day out. Like running the treadmill.
like making coffee.
until he's ready to be saved.
I will rip you apart, Lexi!
you can't. I'm already dead.
[Screaming and groaning]
I can't...
[gasping]
[Indistinct chatter]
[Siren]
[Police radio chatter]
[Sighs]
Ugh! I give up.
it's not anywhere in this room.
[Cell phone vibrates]
what do you want, Jeremy?
did you find that necklace?
not yet. Wait, what's going on?
ghosts of the tomb vampires killed Tobias Fell.
you might want to find that necklace before they start going alphabetically through the founding families.
well, it's not where it's supposed to be.
unless someone took it.
who?
well, who do you think?
I didn't.
she said she didn't take it.
Oh, and you believe her.
I didn't take it, Jeremy.
you know what, yeah, yeah, I do believe her.
you know what, you're an even bigger idiot than I thought.
so wake up, Jeremy, before you lose everything.
what happened?
I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop.
your motives are deceptively pure.
you talk the talk, but I know you'll do anything for your brother.
you won't screw me over as long as we have the same agenda.
I'm supposed to believe you're not going to screw me over?
[Chuckles]
all right. Which way?
I don't know. Flip a coin.
aren't you supposed to be all-knowing?
I'm a ghost. I'm not God.
go left.
or not.
you have trust issues. Anyone ever tell you that?
[Grunting and groaning]
yo.
help a brother out?
[Groaning]
[gasping]
where is Anna now?
I don't know, OK? I don't even know for sure if she took the necklace.
she was the only person who heard us talking about it.
of course she took it. Ok? We have to get it back.
we have to destroy it and then close the door.
I know, but... -- But what?
what, Jer?
I can touch her, Elena.
I can kiss her again.
and I know it's wrong, and I know that I shouldn't feel this way, but I do.
I love her.
I've always loved her.
but it's not real.
she's dead. Gone.
everything that you're hold on to is in the past, Jer.
are you going to love a ghost for the rest of your life?
he's at the beginning of his life, Anna.
you're just holding him back.
you know that.
call Bonnie.
tell her that you have the necklace.
get her to send the ghosts away.
[Groaning]
Oh, I'm having a bad day.
sorry. Thought you might need this.
[Groaning]
you're welcome.
[Grunting and groaning]
what's your game, man?
[Groaning]
I killed you.
I jammed my fist into your chest.
I ripped your heart out.
there's no way this whole buddy-trust act is real.
[Groaning]
you know what the other side is like?
we're all alone.
we watch the people we left behind and we regret our decisions.
that's it.
look, I can't change what happened to me.
but maybe I can change what happens to Tyler.
I don't need revenge, Damon.
I need redemption.
OK.
Jeremy's got the necklace.
he's going to meet us at the witch house.
OK. What's going on up there?
it's Mrs. Lockwood's car.
I'm going to get out of the car. -- What?!
and you're going to drive the hell away from here.
no way! I am not leaving you!
Bonnie, you've got your ghost boyfriend drama.
Elena has hers. And right now the mother of mine is about to be ghost bait.
so go and send them all back to the other side, OK?
this spell is just going to break your foothold, right?
you'll still be here, I'll still be able to see you.
this... this doesn't have to be good-bye.
no. But it should be.
Elena was right. I'm holding you back.
I'm sorry I took the necklace.
I just thought, with all the tomb vampires out, that maybe...
you might find your mother.
I don't know where she is, Jeremy.
I don't know if she's moved on and found peace, or if there's even any peace to be found.
Hey, there is, Anna.
OK, there has to be.
I believe that, OK?
I just...
I don't want to be alone anymore.
you're not going to be alone.
I'm not going to let you be alone.
[crying]
quit fighting me, Stefan.
I know you're in there.
not anymore, Lexi.
you know you say that every time.
until I make you feel again.
Unnggghh!
you wasted your whole life taking care of me.
now you're dead and you still have nothing better to do.
we're running out of time.
you've got to get me more. -- I can't.
No! No... not until I break through.
I can't, Lexi. They have a necklace.
they're going to close the door.
the necklace.
OK.
that necklace.
at least tell me you remember how you felt about that.
you found it during your darkest time.
and you said, when you made it through, that that necklace represented hope.
ironic, then, that it's about to be blown to pieces.
[Groaning]
God! This is not happening.
what now? -- I can't get through.
it's like I'm not invited in.
wait.
I'm not stopping just 'cause you're stuck.
I'll let you know what I find. -- Yeah, but...
looks like you're going to have to trust me.
[Bonnie chanting in latin]
[Music playing]
[Chanting continues]
so?
What'd you find?
it's in...
no, no, no, no.
no, where'd you go?
he's still in there, Elena.
you just have to break through.
it's OK, Lexi, I know what to do now.
you can be free.
[Music continues]
mama?
you are stronger than all of this.
I'm so proud of you.
you're here. -- It's about time.
didn't have anyone else to call?
no, actually, I don't.
cause I need a non-vampire to get in the cave, and other than Elena, you're pretty much the only one I trust.
well, you have a crappy way of showing that.
look, if Mason Lockwood can get over the fact that I killed him, can't you cut me a little slack, Ric?
I shouldn't have to get over it.
I was your friend, Damon.
you shouldn't have done it in the first place.
well! Sometimes...
I do things I don't have to do.
you're going to recycle that same crap ass apology you gave Mason Lockwood?
Yeah. Well...
I didn't mean it with him.
[Music playing]
so what are you going to do, Elena?
you just going to stand there?
waiting for me to dry out?
no, I'm going to go home, take care of my brother. Be a friend to Bonnie and everything else that I have to do.
that's good for you.
you know, I was wondering when you were going to give up.
Lexi gave you... enough of a glimpse into your tragic future.
I haven't given up, Stefan. I still have hope.
but there's nothing that I can do until you get yours back.
Hey.
you can break through this.
fight for it.
feel something. Anything, Stefan.
because if you don't, you're going to lose me forever.
I won't love a ghost for the rest of my life.
just go away, Jeremy.
I owe you an explanation.
Matt let go of a sister before you let go of Anna.
his sister, Jeremy.
you know what you owe me?
the respect of not making me listen to you explain yourself.
I am sorry, Bonnie.
you need to go.
but...
just go, Jeremy.
so was Mason screwing with me, or is there something in there?
I found something.
what is it?
I have no idea.
the only thing stronger than your craving for blood is your love for this one girl.
your humanity is killing you.
turn it off.
what did you do?
I fixed him.
fight for it. Feel something, anything, Stefan.
cause if you don't, you're going to lose me forever.
Klaus killed your mother.
he has a hold on you, on me, on everyone.
he has for 1, 000 years. We have to make it stop!
they're looking for Mikael, the vampire who hunts vampires.
you don't want to wake him. He will kill all of you.
I thought you might know how to kill Klaus.
I can kill Klaus. And I will.
as long as Klaus is alive, I do what he says.
Mikael. - Get Klaus back to Mystic Falls.
and I will gladly drive a stake through his heart.
Fail--I'll drive it through yours.
Portland is fantastic once you can get over all the Whitney music and healthy-looking people.
it's literally a breeding ground for werewolves.
your father's dead.
what did you say to me?
Oh, my mistake.
not your actual father, and not dead.
Mikael.
daggered.
what do you want me to do with the body?
well, first, I want you to explain to me exactly what happened.
all right, we'll say that Mikael followed Elena in here.
he tried to grab her so he could use her as bait.
and you, what, vervained him?
no, we vervained him.
the guy's an original. Make it realistic.
OK. Fine. We vervained him and in the process discovered that he had a dagger which he planned to use on Rebekah.
but instead
we drove it through his heart.
and what happens when he asks to see Mikael's body?
good point.
you, my brother, have been compelled to do what Klaus says.
so if the idea is to lure him back here and kill him,
the last thing we need is you getting tripped up and tongue tied.
well, don't look at me.
I'm just in charge of getting him back here.
Klaus is smart.
if we tell him that Mikael's dead, he'll want proof.
then I shall be dead.
what if he wants to see in person?
well, it means our plan is working.
Klaus will absolutely want to see my body.
you lure him here, and I will kill him.
with what? Those daggers won't work on him.
well, I'm in possession of a stake fashioned from the wood of the ancient white oak tree.
the one that left these ashes when it burned.
where is it?
not here.
knowing its location is my insurance policy.
against what?
you leaving this in my heart.
you see, a vampire can't dagger an original without dying.
So...It falls to you.
you want me to actually dagger you?
Klaus will leave nothing to chance, especially when it comes to trust.
I want to see him.
I want to see his rotting body for myself.
well, he's here.
come by whenever.
if you're lying to me, Stefan, your compulsion will expose you.
so answer with your life, is what you're saying the truth?
it's true. I saw it with my own eyes.
I want to talk to Rebekah.
that's not a problem. She's right here.
Hello, Nik.
Rebekah, love.
what's this I hear about Mikael's tragic run-in with a dagger?
it's true.
he's finally out of our lives for good.
I miss you. I'm miserable here.
I'll be home soon. - Good.
I'll see you then, brother.
he bought it. He's coming home.
now was that easy or what?
let's just get this over with.
finally.
took you long enough.
Rebekah...
whatever fatherly rubbish you're thinking, save it.
nothing you say matters to me.
I see.
Where's my dagger? - Elena has it.
so you can forget your plans to use it on me.
you were never the one I was after.
Nik was my family.
if you were after him, you were after me.
he blinded you, Rebekah. He killed your mother.
I know what he did. And he'll pay for it with his life.
but Nik was not born a killer. None of us were.
you did this to us when you turned us into vampires.
you destroyed our family.
not him.
Rebekah...
I hate everything in my closet.
I have nothing to wear to homecoming.
so don't go. Let's stay home, order take-out and over-analyze ancient hieroglyphic thingies with Alaric.
we have to go. Caroline will kill us.
Oh, Caroline actually has a date.
you know that you can talk to me about Jeremy, right?
I don't need to talk about it.
he fell in love with his ghost girlfriend and lied about it.
what's done is done.
you have to talk about it. He hurt you, Bonnie.
I'm mad at him too.
you're mad at your little brother.
you'll yell at him a little, teach him a life lesson.
you can't really be mad like I'm mad.
Bonnie
and you shouldn't have to be. He's your brother.
so no, I can't really talk to you about it.
we can't trust Rebekah not to turn on us.
Oh, really?
because those original vampires are usually so reliable.
Bonnie was right.
rebekah may be mad at Klaus now, but he is her brother.
her lying, mama-killing, dagger-happy brother.
the wolfsbane's ready.
there are too many things that can go wrong with this plan.
too many people who can make it go wrong.
well, I am formulating a secret contingency plan.
Really? What is it?
well, if I told you, then it won't be a secret.
I need to borrow a tie.
you have your own ties.
I'm 162 years old and I'm going to a homecoming dance.
I need better ties.
you could not go.
I'm compelled to protect you.
and if I look at your track record at high school dances, it's pretty tragic.
my luck you'll go ahead and get yourself murdered by the homecoming queen.
I know how to do it. Alaric taught me.
Elena, if this thing blows up in our face just remember only one of us heals quickly.
Ugh, please tell me that you have a better plan than wolfsbane grenades.
never you mind, brother.
the less you know, the better.
my freedom from Klaus rests entirely upon you two executing your plan perfectly.
so, excuse me if I'm a bit cynical.
you're the one that we should be worried about.
if Klaus asks you one wrong question, whole thing falls apart.
you do have reason to worry.
but if I look back at our history of epic plan failures, it's usually because one of us let our humanity get in the way.
so if I'm taking odds on how this thing goes down, it's certainly not gonna be me who screws it up.
I'll see you at homecoming. I can't wait.
Hey, can you hand me the glitter gun?
Thanks.
Hey, can't we ditch the decorating and go grab a bite?
Oh, I have a thermos in my bag.
I mean a real bite.
rebekah knows some people who like to be fed on.
they're into it. We don't even have to compel them.
OK, first of all, I finally almost just got your mother to stop hating me.
so I probably don't want to get caught in some weird vampire threesome with her son.
and secondly, quit hanging out with Eebekah, the evil blood slut.
just keep the claws in tonight at the dance, ok?
for me?
so who has the misfortune of being compelled to be her date?
Matt said he'd take her.
wait, you set her up with Matt?
she wants to go to the dance, and he didn't have anyone to go with.
he drinks vervain, she can't feed on him.
what's the big deal?
the big deal, Tyler, is that Matt is an innocent, good person who should not be going to dances with evil blood sluts.
Matt's a guy, Caroline.
and Rebekah's hot. Don't overthink this.
this is a sire thing, isn't it?
please tell me this is some weird family extension of your sire bond to Klaus.
I'm here hanging streamers and have glitter all over my hands.
if I'm sired to anybody, it's you.
getting a head start, huh?
embarrassing truth.
this is my first high school dance.
ever?
I never really had time for high school before.
Nik and I were always moving around.
running.
anyway, I didn't want to leave anything to chance.
have you heard any more from him? - No.
but I'm sure that when he does return, he'll do it with flair.
and Damon and my father are all set with their plan?
Yes.
don't tell me. I don't want to know.
I just want to go to the dance and leave the rest to Mikael.
I know it's really hard.
so thank you for helping us get Klaus back into town.
just be careful.
I've been running for 1, 000 years for a reason.
Mikael is not a good person.
and he definitely can't be trusted.
no one in my family can.
are you ok?
I've spent my whole life loving and hating my brother with equal measure.
I never thought that I would be the one to help drive a stake through his heart.
no tears.
I don't want to ruin my makeup.
how do I look?
amazing.
but you're missing one thing.
my mother's necklace.
you should wear it tonight.
may I?
thank you.
I'm so sorry.
I can't leave anything to chance either.
in the back. Harsh.
it had to be done.
rebekah was never going to be completely on our side.
Hey, I'm not judging you.
it's very Katherine of you.
not the way to make me feel better about myself, Damon.
it was a compliment... Sort of.
Stefan is right.
someone's going to let their humanity get in the way and screw this whole thing up.
and it's probably going to be me.
Elena, you just daggered somebody.
you're going to be fine.
Yeah. But I feel bad about it.
I care too much.
that's the problem, Damon.
I'm the weak link.
if it makes you feel any better, she's not really dead.
do you trust him? Mikael?
Nope.
what about Stefan?
no.
not as long as he's under Klaus's control.
then we need a better plan.
I know what to do.
you're just not going to like it.
why not?
because when this all goes down, I don't want you having any part of it.
what does that mean?
do you trust me?
Yes.
then you have nothing to worry about.
what happened?
the gym's flooded.
the dance is cancelled.
excuse me?
well, what are we supposed to do now?!
so does that mean I don't have go?
you wish.
no, Tyler's moving the party to his house.
kegs and beer pong for homecoming?
that's... Different.
just say you're still coming.
I'll see you there.
Elena.
Matt, hey.
um, slight problem with your homecoming date.
what happened?
how would you feel about a back-up date?
how did he plan a better party than me so fast?
is that a band outside?
who are all these people?
this is weird. Where is Tyler?
Hey, Stefan. What's up?
Hey, Tyler. Nice party you got going on here.
Thanks, but I'm not the one throwing it.
I'm just doing what Klaus wants.
what do you mean?
it's not a party, man. It's a wake.
good evening everyone!
I want to thank you all for being here with me to celebrate.
it's been a long time coming.
so much for homecoming.
this is weird.
us being here together.
there's Caroline. She doesn't know anything.
act normal.
Hey, Klaus is here.
what?
Yeah, apparently our sired hybrid friend Tyler thought it'd be ok to let his "master" throw a party.
well, I expected more surprise.
I've learned not to be surprised by anything Klaus does.
I'm going to go find Bonnie.
what's going on?
and what are you two doing here together?
I thought you were supposed to be with Rebekah.
plans changed. I need a drink.
quite the homecoming.
I've been planning my father's funeral for 1, 000 years.
granted, in no version of it were any of these people invited.
but you get the idea.
so now what? You just stop running?
now I reunite my family.
your family.
you mean, the people you cart around in caskets?
none of that matters anymore.
Mikael's gone. Bygones will be bygones.
really great party. I like the band.
seems the homecoming queen still walks among the living, which leaves me to believe Rebekah isn't here.
where is she?
I have no idea. I thought she was coming with Matt.
Oh, be honest now, Stefan.
Where's my sister?
I said I have no idea.
now, would you like me to take you to your father?
well, it wouldn't be a party without the guest of honor, would it?
bring him to me.
all right.
perhaps there's something in it for me?
my freedom from your compulsion.
Oh, you want your freedom?
well, once he's dead and his weapon destroyed, you'll have your freedom.
it'll be my pleasure to give it back to you.
did my daughter go to the dance?
Yep. You missed the photo opportunity.
did you get the stake?
I did.
I'm not going take your word for it.
no offense to your honor and all.
none taken.
fancy.
may I?
it's the only weapon on this earth that can kill an original.
so I think I'll hold on to it. No offense.
I'd offer you a drink, but Katherine tells me you're more of a vampire on the rocks kinda guy.
well, technically, you could still offer.
why feed on vampires?
don't tell me it's for the smooth aftertaste.
I had a hand in creating vampires.
but the blood lust was never my intention.
over the centuries, I learned to feed from the predator, not the innocent.
change in plans.
Klaus is back. He's at the lockwoods.
and he wants your body delivered to his doorstep.
I'm afraid he's in for a colossal disappointment.
well, he's certainly not going to come here.
I hope your plan didn't depend on that.
didn't depend on that.
but you do have a plan. Right?
Oh, yeah. We got a plan, right?
it just doesn't involve you.
you couldn't just break his neck?
it certainly occurred to me.
my Mom would seriously freak if she saw all these people here.
your mother won't be a problem.
I compelled her to go to church and pray for your friends.
what are you talking about?
I want you to look around.
there's Bonnie.
there's Elena and Matt.
there's your pretty little girlfriend Caroline.
their big dance was wrecked tonight and who came through with a party?
you did. What a pal.
but who are all these other people here?
I have no idea.
I've never seen half these people in my life.
well, that's because I invited a few dozen friends of my own.
that's my friend Mindy.
I picked her up along the way in Kansas.
did you know that there's an entire bloodline of werewolves in the heartland?
there's Tony, from North Dakota, and let's not forget the Seattle contingent.
hold on. Are those people all hybrids?
well, they also love a good party.
and they, like you, are sired by me.
they wish to serve their master.
so if anyone should so much as make a move against me, they may feel obligated to retaliate.
feel free to warn your friends.
what are you up to with Klaus?
nothing.
he's on to you, Caroline.
whatever you all think you're about to pull off, he's two steps ahead of you.
OK, I don't know what you're talking about.
you're lying to me.
you know actually I am not.
I don't know anything.
and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you about, because you're sired to team Klaus now.
and you can't be trusted.
so can we please just go back to the party?
Where's your date?
getting me a drink.
well. It seems I have you to thank for Mikael's demise.
he came at me. I didn't have a choice.
still I'm impressed.
it's not easy for a human to dagger an original.
it wasn't the first time.
right. Elijah.
you seem nervous.
I'm not nervous. I just don't like you.
well, straight to the point then, shall I, love?
people have been after me for 1, 000 years.
and I am always one step ahead.
so whatever it is you're thinking of trying, go for it, give it your best shot.
you won't succeed.
invite-only, vampire.
here's my RSVP.
hybrid.
what did you do to her?
it's just vervain.
she'll be fine.
but I need you to get her out of here as fast as possible.
what's going on?
something's going down against Klaus, and this house is full of hybrids like me that can't let anything happen to him.
what do you mean, "Can't"?
I can't explain it.
I can't fight against it.
I just know that I need to protect him no matter who gets in my way.
by attacking Caroline?
I'm protecting her, Matt!
this is the only way to keep her safe.
please. Just get her out of here safely.
get everyone out.
as the host, you should know those hybrids don't make the best first impression.
whatever move you're making, Klaus is going to be ready for you.
he'll kill anyone at this party if he has to.
tell someone who cares.
Bonnie.
Ugh! What the hell is wrong with you?
you're not supposed to witchy migraine me.
you weren't supposed to kill Tyler.
he tried to bite me.
what is that?
nothing.
Oh my god. Is that the
why do you have it?
because I'm the only one who could get inside the house.
you have a visitor.
well, tell my visitor I'm on the brink of victory here.
he said his name is Mikael.
then we mustn't keep him waiting.
move everyone out back.
I'm going to have a little chat with my dad.
Tony, you know what to do.
Hello, Niklaus.
Hello, Mikael. Won't you come in?
Oh, that's right. I forgot. You can't.
or you can come outside if you want.
or I can watch my hybrids tear you limb from limb.
they can't kill me.
true, but it'll make a hell of a party game.
all I have to do is rub these two fingers together, and they'll pounce.
the big bad wolf.
you haven't changed.
still hiding behind your playthings like a coward.
you only forget.
they may be sired by you, but they're still part vampire.
and they can be compelled by me.
come out and face me, Niklaus, or she dies.
go ahead. Kill her.
no, Klaus. He'll do it.
if she dies, this lot will be the last of your abominations.
I don't need them.
I just need to be rid of you.
to what end, Niklaus?
so you can live forever with no one at your side?
nobody cares about you anymore, boy!
who do you have other than those whose loyalty you've forced?
no one.
no one.
I'm calling your bluff, father.
kill her.
come outside and face me, you little coward.
and I won't have to.
my whole life you've underestimated me.
if you kill her, you lose your leverage.
so go ahead. Go on. Kill her.
come on, old man. Kill her.
kill her!
your impulse, Niklaus.
it has and will forever be the one thing that keeps you from truly being great.
Katherine...
kaboom.
what are you doing?!
what the hell did you do?
he's earned his freedom.
thank you, my friend.
you no longer have to do as I say.
you're free.
are you ok?
what do you think?
I'm sorry I stabbed you.
it was the only thing I could think of to get you out of there.
Oh yeah?! Not: "Oh, hey, Caroline, "I'm worried about what might happen this evening.
so maybe you should just "go home and watch dancing with the stars"?
if you knew all your friends were going to get together and try to take down Klaus, would you have left?
no.
so there you go. I saved you from your own stubbornness.
this isn't funny, Tyler!
how am I supposed to be with you when you're sired to him?
I need you to understand, Caroline.
understand what?
that you're one of the bad guys now?
understand that this is who I am.
there's nothing that I can do about it.
Klaus can't be killed.
I can't be fixed.
understand that I'm ok with it.
but how are you ok with it?
because it's better.
I don't have to turn, Caroline.
not unless I want to.
I never have to go through that pain again.
if being sired to Klaus is the price that I have to pay, so be it.
but you don't have any true control over yourself.
I never did before.
the full moon controlled me.
after everything that we've been through you've been there for me through all of it.
don't turn your back on me now.
Tyler...
right.
I just...
got it.
how did this happen?
we thought of everything, Elena!
Klaus having hybrids.
Mikael turning on us.
we brought in Katherine so you weren't in danger.
anything that could have gone wrong, we were prepared.
I don't understand.
Stefan wanted Klaus dead more than anything.
that's what we were counting on.
we blew it.
Where's Katherine?
she ran for the hills, like usual.
the minute things got bad. Who blames her?
Klaus would have crushed her.
I had him, Elena.
I had Klaus.
this could've all be over!
Damon, hey
Hey, listen to me, we'll survive this.
we always survive.
trust me.
we're never getting Stefan back.
you know that, don't you?
then we'll let him go. Ok?
we'll have to let him go.
not interested in the play by play of our failure right now, Katherine.
I'm just calling to say goodbye.
I don't know what to tell you.
you had a good plan, Damon.
and that's high praise coming from me.
it's not very comforting at the moment.
you going back into hiding?
at least my life's not boring.
goodbye, Damon.
take care of yourself, Katherine.
he doesn't know where it all wrong.
he doesn't need to know.
are you good from here?
I need to put about a million miles between myself and Klaus as soon as possible.
Stefan...
Stefan.
Elena.
not exactly.
pep up. I only got a minute before they realize that I'm not at the party.
you seem nervous.
I'm not nervous. I just don't like you.
people have been after me for 1, 000 years.
and I am always one step ahead.
so whatever it is you're thinking of trying, go for it, give it your best shot.
you won't succeed.
it won't be for lack of trying.
now you'd be smart to tell Damon to mind his manners tonight.
cause if I die, I've already insured that he'll die along with me.
even in death, my hybrids have their orders.
so you kill me, you're killing him too.
how did you know that I would stop Damon?
I didn't.
I was just hoping that you would want to.
if Klaus gets killed, he's taking Damon down with him.
so pull the plug on the plan.
and face the wrath of Mikael? We'll all be dead.
OK, look. I know that you've turned off your humanity and that you don't care.
so there's only one solution.
and what's that?
care, Stefan.
care enough to save Damon's life.
because I'm going back to that party and I'm seeing this plan through.
Klaus will be killed and we'll have our freedom.
but then Damon will be dead.
your brother will be dead, Stefan.
unless you care enough to do something about it.
you've wanted Klaus dead for 500 years.
why would you risk all that just to save Damon's life?
I wasn't just trying to save Damon's life, Stefan.
I was trying to save yours.
your humanity.
let's just say I like the old you better.
come on, Katherine, you don't care about anyone but yourself.
you never have.
you and I both know that that is not true.
I loved you.
I loved Damon too.
humanity is a vampire's greatest weakness.
no matter how easy it is to turn it off, it just keeps trying to fight its way back in.
sometimes I let it.
I can't let it all back in.
I don't want to.
not after everything I've done.
of course you don't want to.
but if you don't let yourself feel, you won't be able to do what I need you to do next.
what's that?
get mad.
Rebekah, where are you?
pick up the phone, darling. Daddy's dead.
it's time for a family reunion.
Stefan. Miss me already?
I'm just calling to thank you for my freedom.
I like to believe I'm a man of my word. More or less.
the thing is, it came at too high of a price.
you took everything from me, Klaus.
let bygones be bygones.
trust me, resentment gets old.
you know what never gets old?
revenge.
No!
what's the matter, Klaus?
missing something?
what are you doing?
I'm just enjoying my freedom.
I will kill you and every one you've ever met.
you do that and you'll never see your family again.
I wonder, Klaus.
as someone who's been one step ahead for 1, 000 years.
were you prepared for this?
the only thing stronger than your craving for blood is your love for this one girl.
your humanity is killing you!
turn it off!
what did you do? - I fixed him.
fight for it. Feel something, anything, Stefan.
cause if you don't, you're going to lose me forever.
Klaus killed your mother. He has a hold on you, on me, on everyone.
he has for 1, 000 years. We have to make it stop!
they're looking for Mikael... The vampire who hunts vampires.
you don't want to wake him. He will kill all of you.
I thought you might know how to kill Klaus.
I can kill Klaus. And I will.
as long as Klaus is alive, I do what he says.
Mikael, get Klaus back to Mystic Falls.
and I will gladly drive a stake through his heart.
fail... I'll drive it through yours.
Portland is fantastic once you can get over all the whiney music and healthy-looking people.
it's literally a breeding ground for werewolves.
your father's dead.
what did you say to me? - Oh, my mistake.
not your actual father, and not dead.
Mikael. daggered.
what do you want me to do with the body?
well, first, I want you to explain to me exactly what happened.
all right, we'll say that Mikael followed Elena in here.
he tried to grab her so he could use her as bait.
and you, what, vervained him?
no, we vervained him. The guy's an original.
make it realistic. - Ok. Fine.
we vervained him. And in the process discovered that he had a dagger.
which he planned to use on Rebekah. But instead...
we drove it through his heart.
and what happens when he asks to see Mikael's body?
good point.
you, my brother, have been compelled to do what Klaus says.
so if the idea is to lure him back here and kill him, the last thing we need is you getting tripped up and tongue tied.
well don't look at me. I'm just in charge of getting him back here.
Klaus is smart.
if we tell him that Mikael's dead, he'll want proof.
then I shall be dead.
what if he wants to see in person?
well, it means our plan is working.
Klaus will absolutely want to see my body.
you lure him here, and I will kill him.
with what? Those daggers won't work on him.
well, I'm in possession of a stake fashioned from the wood of the ancient white oak tree.
the one that left these ashes when it burned.
where is it?
not here.
knowing its location is my insurance policy.
against what?
you leaving this in my heart.
you see, a vampire can't dagger an original without dying.
so... it falls to you.
you want me to actually dagger you?
Klaus will leave nothing to chance.
especially when it comes to trust.
I want to see him. I want to see his rotting body for myself.
well, he's here.
come by whenever.
if you're lying to me, Stefan, your compulsion will expose you.
so answer with your life.
is what you're saying the truth?
it's true.
I saw it with my own eyes. - I want to talk to Rebekah.
that's not a problem. She's right here.
Hello, Nik. - Rebekah, love.
what's this I hear about Mikael's tragic run-in with a dagger?
it's true.
he's finally out of our lives for good.
I miss you.
I'm miserable here.
I'll be home soon. - Good.
I'll see you then, brother.
he bought it.
he's coming home.
now was that easy or what?
let's just get this over with.
finally.
took you long enough.
whatever fatherly rubbish you're thinking, save it.
nothing you say matters to me.
I see.
Where's my dagger? - Elena has it.
so you can forget your plans to use it on me.
you were never the one I was after.
Nik was my family. If you were after him, you were after me.
he blinded you, Rebekah. He killed your mother.
I know what he did. And he'll pay for it with his life.
but Nik was not born a killer. None of us were.
you did this to us when you turned us into vampires.
you destroyed our family.
not him. - Rebekah...
I hate everything in my closet. I have nothing to wear to homecoming.
so don't go.
let's stay home, order take-out and over-analyze ancient hieroglyphic thingies with Alaric.
we have to go. Caroline will kill us.
Oh, Caroline actually has a date.
you know that you can talk to me about Jeremy, right?
I don't need to talk about it.
he fell in love with his ghost girlfriend and lied about it.
what's done is done.
you have to talk about it. He hurt you, Bonnie.
I'm mad at him too. - You're mad at your little brother.
you'll yell at him a little, teach him a life lesson.
you can't really be mad like I'm mad.
Bonnie... - And you shouldn't have to be.
he's your brother.
so no, I can't really talk to you about it.
we can't trust Rebekah not to turn on us.
Oh, really?
because those original vampires are usually so reliable.
Bonnie was right.
rebekah may be mad at Klaus now, but he is her brother.
her lying, mama-killing, dagger-happy brother.
the wolfsbane's ready.
there are too many things that can go wrong with this plan.
too many people who can make it go wrong.
well, I am formulating a secret contingency plan.
Really? What is it?
well, if I told you, then it won't be a secret.
I need to borrow a tie. - You have your own ties.
I'm 162 years old and I'm going to a homecoming dance.
I need better ties. - You could not go.
I'm compelled to protect you.
and if I look at your track record at high school dances, it's pretty tragic.
my luck you'll go ahead and get yourself murdered by the homecoming queen.
no - I know how to do it. Alaric taught me.
Elena, if this thing blows up in our face just remember only one of us heals quickly.
Ugh, please tell me that you have a better plan than wolfsbane grenades.
never you mind, brother. The less you know, the better.
my freedom from Klaus rests entirely upon you two executing your plan perfectly.
so, excuse me if I'm a bit cynical.
you're the one that we should be worried about.
if Klaus asks you one wrong question, whole thing falls apart.
you do have reason to worry.
but if I look back at our history of epic plan failures, it's usually because one of us let our humanity get in the way.
so if I'm taking odds on how this thing goes down, it's certainly not gonna be me who screws it up.
I'll see you at homecoming. I can't wait.
Hey, can you hand me the glitter gun?
Thanks.
Hey, can't we ditch the decorating and go grab a bite?
Oh, I have a thermos in my bag.
I mean a real bite.
rebekah knows some people who like to be fed on.
they're into it. We don't even have to compel them.
OK, first of all, I finally almost just got your mother to stop hating me.
so I probably don't want to get caught in some weird vampire threesome with her son.
and secondly, quit hanging out with Rebekah, the evil blood slut.
just keep the claws in tonight at the dance, ok?
for me?
so who has the misfortune of being compelled to be her date?
Matt said he'd take her. - Wait, you set her up with Matt?
she wants to go to the dance, and he didn't have anyone to go with.
he drinks vervain, she can't feed on him. What's the big deal?
the big deal, Tyler, is that Matt is an innocent, good person who should not be going to dances with evil blood sluts.
Matt's a guy, Caroline. And Rebekah's hot.
don't overthink this.
this is a sire thing, isn't it?
please tell me this is some weird family extension of your sire bond to Klaus.
I'm here hanging streamers and have glitter all over my hands.
if I'm sired to anybody, it's you.
getting a head start, huh?
embarrassing truth.
this is my first high school dance. - Ever?
I never really had time for high school before.
Nik and I were always moving around. Running.
anyway, I didn't want to leave anything to chance.
have you heard any more from him? - No.
but I'm sure that when he does return, he'll do it with flair.
and Damon and my father are all set with their plan?
Yes.
don't tell me. I don't want to know.
I just want to go to the dance and leave the rest to Mikael.
I know it's really hard.
so thank you for helping us get Klaus back into town.
just be careful.
I've been running for 1, 000 years for a reason.
Mikael is not a good person. And he definitely can't be trusted.
no one in my family can.
are you ok?
I've spent my whole life loving and hating my brother with equal measure.
I never thought that I would be the one to help drive a stake through his heart.
no tears. I... I don't want to ruin my makeup.
how do I look?
you look amazing.
but you're missing one thing.
my mother's necklace.
you should wear it tonight.
may I?
thank you.
I'm so sorry.
I can't leave anything to chance either.
in the back.
harsh.
it had to be done.
rebekah was never going to be completely on our side.
Hey, I'm not judging you. It's very Katherine of you.
not the way to make me feel better about myself, Damon.
it was a compliment... Sort of.
Stefan is right.
someone's going to let their humanity get in the way and screw this whole thing up.
and it's probably going to be me.
Elena, you just daggered somebody.
you're going to be fine. Yeah. - But I feel bad about it.
I care too much. That's the problem, Damon.
I'm the weak link.
if it makes you feel any better, she's not really dead.
do you trust him? Mikael?
Nope.
what about Stefan? - No.
not as long as he's under Klaus's control.
then we need a better plan. - I know what to do.
you're just not going to like it. - Why not?
because when this all goes down, I don't want you having any part of it.
what does that mean?
do you trust me? Yes.
then you have nothing to worry about.
what happened? - The gym's flooded.
the dance is canceled. - Excuse me?
well, what are we supposed to do now?!
so does that mean I don't have go? - You wish.
no, Tyler's moving the party to his house.
kegs and beer pong for homecoming? That's... different.
just say you're still coming.
I'll see you there.
Elena. - Matt, hey.
um, slight problem with your homecoming date.
what happened?
how would you feel about a back-up date?
how did he plan a better party than me so fast?
is that a band outside? - Who are all these people?
this is weird. Where is Tyler?
Hey, Stefan. - What's up? Hey, Tyler.
nice party you got going on here.
Thanks, but I'm not the one throwing it.
I'm just doing what Klaus wants.
what do you mean? - It's not a party, man.
it's a wake.
good evening everyone!
I want to thank you all for being here with me to celebrate.
it's been a long time coming.
so much for homecoming.
this is weird.
us being here together.
there's Caroline. She doesn't know anything. Act normal.
Hey, Klaus is here. - What?
Yeah, apparently our sired hybrid friend Tyler thought it'd be ok to let his "master" throw a party.
well, I expected more surprise.
I've learned not to be surprised by anything Klaus does.
I'm going to go find Bonnie.
what's going on? And what are you two doing here together?
I thought you were supposed to be with Rebekah.
plans changed. I need a drink.
quite the homecoming.
I've been planning my father's funeral for 1, 000 years.
granted, in no version of it were any of these people invited.
but you get the idea.
so now what? You just stop running?
now I reunite my family. - Your family.
you mean, the people you cart around in caskets?
none of that matters anymore. Mikael's gone.
bygones will be bygones.
really great party. I like the band.
seems the homecoming queen still walks among the living, which leaves me to believe Rebekah isn't here. Where is she?
I have no idea. I thought she was coming with Matt.
Oh, be honest now, Stefan.
Where's my sister?
I said I have no idea.
now, would you like me to take you to your father?
well, it wouldn't be a party without the guest of honor, would it?
bring him to me.
all right.
perhaps there's something in it for me?
my freedom from your compulsion.
Oh, you want your freedom?
well, once he's dead and his weapon destroyed, you'll have your freedom.
it'll be my pleasure to give it back to you.
did my daughter go to the dance? - Yep.
you missed the photo op.
did you get the stake? - I did.
I'm not going take your word for it. No offense to your honor and all.
none taken.
fancy. May I?
it's the only weapon on this Earth that can kill an original.
so I think I'll hold on to it. No offense.
I'd offer you a drink, but Katherine tells me you're more of a vampire on the rocks kinda guy.
well, technically, you could still offer.
why feed on vampires?
don't tell me it's for the smooth aftertaste.
I had a hand in creating vampires. But the blood lust was never my intention.
over the centuries, I learned to feed from the predator, not the innocent.
change in plans. Klaus is back. He's at the Lockwoods.
and he wants your body delivered to his doorstep.
I'm afraid he's in for a colossal disappointment.
well, he's certainly not going to come here.
I hope your plan didn't depend on that. - Didn't depend on that.
but you do have a plan. Right?
Oh, yeah. We got a plan, right?
it just doesn't involve you.
couldn't just break his neck? - It certainly occurred to me.
my mom would seriously freak if she saw all these people here.
your mother won't be a problem. I compelled her to go to church and pray for your friends.
what are you talking about?
I want you to look around.
there's Bonnie. There's Elena and Matt.
there's your pretty little girlfriend Caroline.
their big dance was wrecked tonight and who came through with a party?
you did. What a pal.
but who are all these other people here?
I have no idea. I've never seen half these people in my life.
well, that's because I invited a few dozen friends of my own.
that's my friend mindy.
I picked her up along the way in Kansas.
did you know that there's an entire bloodline of werewolves in the heartland?
there's Tony, from North Dakota, and let's not forget the Seattle contingent.
hold on. Are those people all hybrids?
well, they also love a good party.
and they, like you, are sired by me. They wish to serve their master.
so if anyone should so much as make a move against me, they may feel obligated to retaliate.
feel free to warn your friends.
what are you up to with Klaus?
nothing. - He's on to you, Caroline.
whatever you all think you're about to pull off, he's 2 steps ahead of you.
OK, I don't know what you're talking about.
you're lying to me.
heh, you know, actually, I'm not. I don't know anything.
and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you about, because you're sired to team Klaus now.
and you can't be trusted.
so can we please just go back to the party?
Where's your date?
getting me a drink.
well... Seems I have you to thank for Mikael's demise.
he came at me. I didn't have a choice.
still I'm impressed. It's not easy for a human to dagger an original.
it wasn't the first time.
right. Elijah.
you seem nervous.
I'm not nervous. I just don't like you.
right. Straight to the point then, shall I, love?
people have been after me for 1, 000 years.
and I am always one step ahead.
so whatever it is you're thinking of trying, go for it, give it your best shot.
you won't succeed.
invite-only, vampire.
here's my rsvp.
hybrid.
what did you do to her? - It's just vervain.
she'll be fine. But I need you to get her out of here as fast as possible.
what's going on?
something's going down against Klaus, and this house is full of hybrids like me that can't let anything happen to him.
what do you mean,"can't"? - I can't explain it.
I can't fight against it.
I just know that I need to protect him no matter who gets in my way.
by attacking Caroline? - I'm protecting her, Matt!
this is the only way to keep her safe.
please. Just get her out of here safely.
get everyone out.
as the host, you should know those hybrids don't make the best first impression.
whatever move you're making, Klaus is going to be ready for you.
he'll kill anyone at this party if he has to.
tell someone who cares.
what the hell is wrong with you?
you're not supposed to witchy migraine me.
you weren't supposed to kill Tyler. - He tried to bite me.
what is that?
nothing. - Oh my God. Is that the...
why do you have it?
because I'm the only one who could get inside the house.
you have a visitor.
well, tell my visitor I'm on the brink of victory here.
he said his name is Mikael.
then we mustn't keep him waiting.
move everyone out back.
I'm going to have a little chat with my dad.
Tony, you know what to do.
Hello, Niklaus.
Hello, Mikael. Won't you come in?
Oh, that's right. I forgot. You can't.
or you can come outside if you want.
or I can watch my hybrids tear you limb from limb.
they can't kill me.
true, but it'll make a hell of a party game.
all I have to do is rub these 2 fingers together, and they'll pounce.
the big bad wolf.
you haven't changed.
still hiding behind your playthings like a coward.
you only forget.
they may be sired by you, but they're still part vampire.
and they can be compelled by me.
come out and face me, Niklaus, or she dies.
go ahead.
kill her. - No, Klaus. He'll do it.
if she dies, this lot will be the last of your abominations.
I don't need them. I just need to be rid of you.
to what end, Niklaus?
so you can live forever with no one at your side?
nobody cares about you anymore, boy!
who do you have other than those whose loyalty you've forced?
no one.
no one.
I'm calling your bluff, father.
kill her.
come outside and face me, you little coward.
and I won't have to.
my whole life you've underestimated me.
if you kill her, you lose your leverage. So go ahead.
go on. Kill her. Come on, old man.
kill her. Kill her!
your impulse, Niklaus.
it has and will forever be the one thing that keeps you from truly being great.
kaboom.
what are you doing?!
what the hell did you do?
he's earned his freedom.
thank you, my friend.
you no longer have to do as I say. You're free.
are you ok? - What do you think?
I'm sorry I stabbed you.
it was the only thing I could think of to get you out of there.
Oh yeah?!
Oh, hey, Caroline," I'm worried about what might happen this evening.
so maybe you should just go home and watch 'Dancing with the stars?
" if you knew all your friends were going to get together and try to take down Klaus, would you have left?
no. - So there you go.
I saved you from your own stubbornness.
this isn't funny, Tyler!
how am I supposed to be with you when you're sired to him?
I need you to understand, Caroline.
understand what? That you're one of the bad guys now?
understand that this is who I am.
there's nothing that I can do about it.
Klaus can't be killed. I can't be fixed.
understand that I'm ok with it. - But how are you ok with it?
because it's better.
I don't have to turn, Caroline.
not unless I want to.
I never have to go through that pain again.
if being sired to Klaus is the price that I have to pay, so be it.
but you don't have any true control over yourself.
I never did before. The full moon controlled me.
after everything that we've been through you've been there for me through all of it.
don't turn your back on me now.
Tyler... - Right.
I just... - Got it.
how did this happen? - We thought of everything, Elena!
Klaus having hybrids. Mikael turning on us.
we brought in Katherine so you weren't in danger.
anything that could have gone wrong, we were prepared.
I don't understand. Stefan wanted Klaus dead more than anything.
that's what we were counting on.
we blew it.
Where's Katherine? - She ran for the hills, like usual.
the minute things got bad. Who blames her?
Klaus would have crushed her.
I had him, Elena. I had Klaus.
this could've all be over!
Damon, hey... Hey, listen to me we'll survive this.
we always survive.
trust me.
we're never getting Stefan back.
you know that, don't you?
then we'll let him go. Ok?
we'll have to let him go.
not interested in the play by play of our failure right now, Katherine.
I'm just calling to say goodbye.
I don't know what to tell you.
you had a good plan, Damon.
and that's high praise coming from me.
it's not very comforting at the moment.
you going back into hiding?
at least my life's not boring. Goodbye, Damon.
take care of yourself, Katherine.
he doesn't know where it all wrong.
he doesn't need to know.
are you good from here?
I need to put about a million miles between myself and Klaus as soon as possible.
Elena. Not exactly.
pep up.
I only got a minute before they realize that I'm not at the party.
you seem nervous. I'm not nervous. I just don't like you.
people have been after me for 1, 000 years.
and I am always one step ahead.
so whatever it is you're thinking of trying, go for it, give it your best shot.
you won't succeed.
it won't be for lack of trying.
now you'd be smart to tell Damon to mind his manners tonight.
cause if I die, I've already insured that he'll die along with me.
even in death, my hybrids have their orders.
so you kill me, you're killing him too.
how did you know that I would stop Damon?
I didn't.
I was just hoping that you would want to.
if Klaus gets killed, he's taking Damon down with him.
so pull the plug on the plan.
and face the wrath of Mikael? We'll all be dead.
OK, look. I know that you've turned off your humanity and that you don't care.
so there's only one solution.
and what's that?
care, Stefan.
care enough to save Damon's life.
because I'm going back to that party and I'm seeing this plan through.
Klaus will be killed and we'll have our freedom.
but then Damon will be dead.
your brother will be dead, Stefan.
unless you care enough to do something about it.
you've wanted Klaus dead for 500 years.
why would you risk all that just to save Damon's life?
I wasn't just trying to save Damon's life, Stefan.
I was trying to save yours.
your humanity.
let's just say I like the old you better.
Nah. Come on, Katherine, you don't care about anyone but yourself. You never have.
you and I both know that that is not true.
I loved you.
I loved Damon too.
humanity is a vampire's greatest weakness.
no matter how easy it is to turn it off, it keeps trying to fight its way back in.
sometimes I let it.
I can't let it all back in.
I don't want to. Not after everything I've done.
of course you don't want to.
but if you don't let yourself feel, you won't be able to do what I need you to do next.
what's that?
get mad.
Rebekah, where are you?
pick up the phone, darling. Daddy's dead.
it's time for a family reunion.
Stefan. Miss me already?
I'm just calling to thank you for my freedom.
I like to believe I'm a man of my word. More or less.
the thing is, it came at too high of a price.
you took everything from me, Klaus.
let bygones be bygones. Trust me, resentment gets old.
you know what never gets old?
revenge - no - What's the matter, Klaus?
missing something?
what are you doing?
I'm just enjoying my freedom.
I will kill you and every one you've ever met.
you do that and you'll never see your family again.
I wonder, Klaus.
as someone who's been one step ahead for 1, 000 years.
were you prepared for this?
you took everything from me, Klaus.
let bygones be bygones. Resentment gets old.
no one ever gets old? - Revenge, no.
what's the matter, Klaus, missing something?
I will kill you and everyone you've ever met.
do that and you'll never see your family again.
the spirits hate Klaus as much as we do?
they're using their powers to hide in the coffins.
it just won't open. I've tried everything.
and then it's closed with a spell.
he's been sired. He feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus' blood created him.
I'm not giving Klaus anything. - He's gonna kill Jeremy.
not really my problem.
Jeremy, move!
I have no idea how you're on your feet right now, but I need to run some more tests.
actually, I have someplace I need to be, doctor... - Fell.
your sister thinks we should have another one of our talks.
you're going to leave Mystic Falls behind and never think twice about it.
if I thought for one second that I wouldn't have to feel guilty anymore...
guilty for what? - For wanting what I want.
you're gonna put a hole in that thing.
wanna talk about it? - Nothing to talk about.
morning. - You're late.
we're supposed to meet Bonnie at the old witch house in 10 minutes.
relax, brother. You don't want your hair to fall out.
would you hurry up? We have work to do.
you know, Klaus isn't going to spontaneously selfdestruct.
why are you all chipper? - No reason.
be with you in a minute.
so, uh, what's got you all worked up?
I didn't really sleep last night.
Yeah, me neither. Probably something to do with dying.
are you ok? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I think the ring, however, is running low on batteries.
Yeah, it's another reason why Jeremy has to get out of town.
if those rings have a shelf life, he's not protected. Neither are you.
nice. Nice. You're getting stronger.
I'm channeling frustration.
I need coffee.
I guess Damon's compulsion worked.
Jeremy was packing when I left the house.
he was going on about his new schooling.
have you, uh, talked to Damon today?
no. Why?
no reason.
why won't you open?
Hello?
is someone there?
you didn't say anything to Elena about the coffins, right?
no. I said I wouldn't.
I know what you said. - Then why are you asking?
because protecting the location of Klaus' family is my number one priority right now and the fewer people who know, the better.
what?
these hybrids are really bringing the neighborhood down.
Hey, sorry I'm late. I, uh...
I got held up. - It's ok.
I just got here, too.
will you pass me the balloons?
Thanks.
what got you running late?
I, uh, was working on some new spells.
you? - Working out with Alaric.
[Happy Birthday Caroline!]
so, uh... I have something I need to tell you...
and you're not going to like it. - What happened?
Jeremy's going to be leaving town for a while.
he'll be staying with some old family friends in Denver until this whole Klaus thing blows over.
Jeremy wouldn't just leave you to deal with Klaus on your own.
I know.
I asked Damon to compel him.
you what? - I know, Bonnie.
but it's not safe for him here anymore.
leaving will give him a better life.
the only reason I'm telling you is because I know that you two haven't really worked out your stuff.
I kinda thought maybe you'd want to say goodbye.
you're wasting your time. - It won't open.
did you bury the body?
Yeah.
any sign of our little hybrid buddies?
Nope, just the dead one.
all right, Klaus has 6 siblings. Rebekah is now with Klaus.
there was one dead kid in the old world, one dead kid in the new world, which leaves Elijah and 2 others, 3 sleeping originals, 4 coffins.
so, who was in the lockbox? - No idea.
but whatever's in here, Bonnie seems to think will help us kill Klaus.
so, as soon as you can get this thing open, the sooner we'll know she's right.
you'd think the spirits of a bunch of dead witches that can make a coffin invisible, that they'd figure out how to open one!
fine, don't help.
you know none of this is going to do us any good if Klaus' hybrid friends find our hiding spot, right?
they need to go away.
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea, Stefan.
why don't you just ask him to pack a bag and take a long vacation while you're at it?
how about you keep the peace?
don't draw attention to the very things that we're trying to hide.
I'm not going to play defense when I have what Klaus wants.
he does what I say or I dump his family to the bottom of the ocean.
then he kills you and everyone you know, like, I don't know, me.
no, he's bluffing.
his family means more to him than anything else.
you sure about that? - Oh, I don't know, Damon.
I mean, I guess there's only one way to find out, right?
call his bluff.
the only way to call someone's bluff, Stefan, is to be willing to lose everything if you're wrong.
denver, huh?
so, were you going to say goodbye?
I wasn't sure you cared. - Of course I care.
I was hurt by what happened between you and Anna, Jeremy.
I don't want you to leave town.
I think this could be a good thing, at least until all this Klaus stuff blows over.
I think I can have a better life there.
that's what Elena said.
it's exactly what she said.
what do you mean?
nothing. I'm just sorry you have to go, that's all.
I can't talk to you. - I know you're upset with me.
upset? - But I...
you almost got Jeremy killed.
and before you ask me to understand or to support you, can you at least tell me what you're planning to do about your sire bond to Klaus?
there's nothing that I can do about it, Caroline.
that's the point.
I just wanted you to know that...
I understand why you can't be with me.
even though I want to put you first, before anyone...
I can't.
I'll never be able to. And I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted you to know that.
I'm sorry, too.
happy birthday.
sweet dreams, Rebekah.
show her to her room, would you, love? - Sure.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
I gave you your freedom. You could have gone anywhere.
I live here, Klaus.
well, if we're playing this game, then, uh... I was here first.
you know, I don't like your hybrid friends.
they're everywhere, kind of like fleas.
I want them gone.
Yeah, well, uh, I kind of like having them around.
you know, I'm hurt.
I hoped that, uh, I'd free you and we'd pick up where we left off, but here you are, guzzling vervain like the rest of them, I'm sure.
so much for friendship.
friends don't strip friends of their free will.
OK, granted, yeah, that was a little extreme, but I get a little moody.
just ask my siblings. Speaking of whom...
isn't it time you handed them over?
get your hybrids out of Mystic Falls or I will remove them myself.
you see, if you continue to threaten me, I'm going to be forced to retaliate.
kill people. And it'll get messy again.
do whatever you want. I don't really care.
or you know what? Maybe I do. Yeah.
Yeah, maybe I care so much that I drop Elijah into the Arctic.
well, maybe I'd be willing to lose one brother if it meant killing yours.
try me. Let's find out.
is everything ok? - Everything's fine, Mindy.
Stefan was just leaving after failing to make his point.
well... One down.
you may want to, uh, send the rest of them away before it gets messy...Again.
surprise! Surprise!
happy birthday!
what are you guys doing here?
well, you blew off school and missed our, work of birthday art, so, uh...
change into warmer clothes, we're going to the falls.
s'mores, campfire.
cake. Like when we were little.
except with tequila.
Ah, thanks, guys, really.
I'm just not really feeling my birthday this year.
I'm sorry, what?
you've already claimed your birthday as everyone's favorite day of the year.
Yeah. And now it's just a reminder that, technically, I'm dead.
look, I didn't even like 17.
the only point to 17 was to get to 18. It's a filler year.
I am stuck in a filler year. - You're not stuck, Caroline.
Yeah, I am. But it's ok.
you know, it's all good. I will be fine.
but I just need some time to wallow in it.
OK. Well, I think I have another idea.
what do you want me to do with her head?
just get rid of it. Burn it.
I honesty don't care, Daniel.
you called? I'm here.
what happened?
what happened is Stefan had 2 paths in front of him and he chose the one that made me angry.
I need you to help me do something about that.
can't you just leave me out of it?
what would be the point in that?
seriously, man, can't you just get one of your other hybrids to do your bidding?
I lost my friends, my girlfriend.
right, your, uh, your girlfriend.
um, about her... I need you to bite her.
what? - Don't make me repeat myself.
a hybrid bite would kill a vampire. Yeah, yeah. I know exactly what it will do.
uh, Stefan pushed me too far, so I'm pushing back. - I'm not biting Caroline!
Tyler, I've been supernaturally blessed with the good fortune of a sire bond to you, so one could consider this me putting your undying loyalty to the test.
what the hell is wrong with you?
I'm not hurting Caroline.
all right. All right.
I'm disappointed, but you know, it's your choice, free will and all that.
I'll find another way to strike at Stefan.
you can go now.
I thought Stefan saved your life. - He did.
and now he's willing to risk it just to see how far he can push Klaus?
seems so. - Well, is his humanity on or off?
Yeah, I'm thinking there's another option here in play, a bit of a dimmer switch, which is a huge problem. Why?
because I can't predict how far he's willing to go until somebody gets killed.
suddenly you care who lives or dies?
I have a small list.
talk about humanity dimmer switch. - Screw you.
can't the council meeting ever just be a council meeting?
[WICKERY BRIDGE - Restoration Fundraiser]
Oh, there it is.
this is creepy. Even for us.
no, Caroline was right.
technically, she's dead.
sorry. But you don't need a birthday, you need a funeral.
you need to say goodbye to your old life so that you can move on with your new one.
OK.
here lies Caroline Forbes.
cheerleader, miss Mystic Falls, third grade hopscotch champion.
friend... Daughter...
overachiever.
mean girl, sometimes, no offense.
none taken.
she was 17 and she had a really good life.
so, rest in peace so that you can move forward.
that's what you really need.
it's what we all really need.
Amen or cheers or whatever.
uh, Bonnie...
nice. Ok, make a wish.
this is the bridge where Elena's and Jeremy's parents died in a car accident.
something's up with her. Elena.
something more than usual. Do you know what it is?
well, I'm sure it starts with a Stef and ends with an "n."
I'm gonna get a drink, write a check, and then we're out.
well, Alaric Saltzman...
miracle patient. - Dr. Fell.
I'm glad to see you're still alive.
half of me thought you'd drop dead in your sleep.
Yeah, well, I guess I have 9 lives.
not a bad thing to have in a town with a vampire problem.
I'm... I'm sorry.
are you on the founders' council?
I'm a founder. I come from a long line of founders.
may they rest in peace.
I hate that bridge.
my senior prom date dumped me on this bridge.
Oh, yeah? Did you throw him over it?
no. But I should have. I've been holding a grudge ever since.
where did your, um, friend go? I'm supposed to hit him up for some money for the fundraiser.
well, you should. He's loaded.
he's in good company. Some British guy just pledged to match ever dollar we raise.
what do you mean, British guy?
you know, Carol, when I think of them now, I think of an old fuddy duddy, - but you really have changed my perception. - Thank you. You are just delightful.
what color are your eyes? - They're blue.
they are. - Look at what the cat dragged in.
nice vest. - Well, thank you very much. Good to see you, Damon.
Carol and I were just discussing whether you'd be tonight's other big benefactor.
what do you say, Damon? Klaus has made a very generous pledge.
you know how we're chomping at the bit to begin the renovation.
Carol, don't take this the wrong way, but do you realize that you've been kissing the ass of an immoral hybrid who ruined your son's life?
Oh, come now. Some might say I saved it, what all that nasty full moon business.
I never had to go through it myself more than twice to be honest, but still...
I'm very sympathetic.
Klaus has promised to protect Tyler, Damon, and our town.
from who? His hybrids are the ones the town needs protection from.
well, I'd have no use for them if your brother would kindly return my family.
not gonna happen.- That's what I thought, which is why I've come to an agreement with the mayor.
you and the council stay out of my hair, I'll stay out of yours.
your town gets protected, my hybrids get left alone and everybody will be happy.
all you have to do is to get Stefan to stop decapitating my friends.
please, Damon. Just get your brother under control or the council will be forced to take action against him.
you've got to be kidding me.
Oh, come on, mate, give peace a chance.
I need it more than you do, trust me.
Caroline, what are you doing?
nothing.
OK, you're a bad sober liar. You're an even worse drunk liar.
I might have texted Tyler.
Caroline. - What? I'm delicate.
give her a break. You can't control what everyone does all the time.
I'm sorry. I know it's Caroline's birthday, funeral or whatever, but...
I just feel it's really wrong that you compelled Jeremy to leave town.
I'm doing it to protect him, Bonnie.
I want to give him a chance at a halfway normal life.
he should be able to choose how he wants to live it.
you're taking his choices away.
Bonnie, you can't tell him. - Why?
are you gonna compel me not to?
you know, you guys are ruining a perfectly good funeral.
I'm sorry. I'm just gonna go sleep it off or something.
happy birthday.
the mayor's looking out for Tyler.
for now we have to assume Klaus has her in his pocket.
Oh, please don't tell me you're going to drink the Klaus koolaid.
I'm not going to let him hold this town hostage.
but I'm also not going to let innocent people get caught in the crossfire of a pissing contest between a hybrid and a vampire.
Liz, I'm impressed. You're all strong and sheriff.
I'm not kidding, Damon.
get Stefan to stand down from this one before someone gets hurt.
what are you doing? You're gonna ruin your career.
says the guy who got his job from his dad.
do you have any idea what you're messing with?
I know what I'm doing. - Damn it, Meredith.
back off, Brian.
Hey, is everything all right here?
everything's fine. - It didn't look fine.
you might want to get to know her before you become her white knight.
she's kind of a psycho case.
you're that guy, aren't you?
the one begging to have his teeth kicked in.
take it from me, man, life's too short.
just go away, Brian.
behold... My senior prom date.
Ah, you definitely should have thrown him over the bridge.
unfortunately, I have to work with him.
he's on the council, the medical examiner.
the guy who signs his name under cause of death, "animal attack."
I get it. - Yeah.
duty calls.
thanks for the hero moment.
anytime.
what are you doing? - What are you doing?
no dead hybrids at the founder's party.
no. I told Klaus to get his hybrids out of town.
he didn't listen, so now I'm saying it louder.
you don't think there's 10 more where that came from?
and if you kill them, Klaus won't make 20 more?
have you forgotten about Elena's part in all this or do you not care if she's a human blood bag for the rest of her life?
protecting Elena is your problem now.
see, I'm not compelled by Klaus to do it anymore.
don't give me that no humanity crap.
you can't just flip your switch.
your switch is fried, Stefan, just like your brain.
you want to take Klaus, you want to beat the villain, you got to be smarter.
to beat the villain, Damon, you have to be the better villain.
sorry. I didn't mean to crash the party.
so don't.
no. It's, uh, it's ok.
can I talk to you for a sec?
it's kind of important.
are you ok? - Yeah.
I want her to be happy, you know?
that's what I want for all of you guys, in the middle of this crazy life you got stuck living.
is that how you see it?
that we're stuck?
I'd say its attached itself to all of you pretty tight, yeah.
Bonnie's right. You know, I have no business messing in Jeremy's head.
I just didn't know what else to do.
he's in danger here.
I can't lose anyone else I love.
I take it all back.
everything I said this morning.
Klaus can't control me.
not when it comes to you.
I won't let him. - Tyler, it's ok.
maybe we just weren't meant to be together.
maybe we just have to accept that and move on.
I'm not moving on from anything.
I love you.
what?
what just happened?
Oh, no. - Did you...did you just bite me?
Oh, my God. - I'm sorry.
Oh, my God! - Oh, no. Caroline?
Oh, my God. Caroline?
just get away from me! Get away from me!
great. We've been abandoned.
OK, we're going into search party.
I don't trust that she won't get back together with him.
come on, Caroline. We don't have any more drinks.
Matt's being haunted by the Fell ghosts.
what are you doing, Stefan?
Hello, Damon. She's a little busy right now.
why the hell do you have Elena's phone?
making my next move. Let me ask you something, what's Klaus gonna do if he can't make any more hybrids?
what? - Stefan, leave her out of this.
what are you doing? Stefan, let me out of this car!
do you hear me? Let me out of the car!
what now? You just pulled me away from a fascinating conversation about landscaping the town square.
Stefan just grabbed Elena. - What? He's getting desperate.
he's gonna try to use her against you. Do what he says.
get rid of your hybrids. - Or what?
Stefan would never dream of killing her.
are you sure about that? He just tried to behead someone in the middle of a council party.
he's operating on crazy right now.
well, crazy or not, that kind of love never dies.
he's bluffing.
maybe he is, maybe he isn't, but if you don't want to believe him, believe me.
I know my brother better than anyone and right now I don't have a clue how far he's willing to take this.
so, if he says blink, I suggest you blink.
sheriff Forbes! - What happened?
Tyler bit her. - Oh, my God.
sweetheart. Be careful.
Oh, honey. Caroline?
honey, can you hear me? - I'm sorry, mom.
she's been hallucinating or something. I don't know.
no one's picking up their phone.
it's all right, sweetheart.
so, what's the plan, Stefan?
what's the big move you're making?
I took Klaus' family to make him suffer.
I'm not going to let him make him suffer more.
so, then what are you going to do, huh?
are you going to lock me in some cave and keep me hostage?
maybe I'll just turn you into a vampire.
stop the car, Stefan!
stop the car, Stefan!
Stefan, how nice to hear your voice.
tell your hybrids to get out of town, Klaus.
well, that's not going to happen until I get my coffins back.
OK. Well, then I'm going to drive your blood source off Wickery bridge.
I don't believe you, Stefan. You won't kill her.
No! No! No!
what are you doing? - What's going on?
I just fed her my blood.
no more hybrids if she's a vampire.
you won't do it. - Really?
try me because your coffins are next to go.
say goodbye to your family, Klaus.
Stefan, slow down! Stefan, slow down!
fine. I'll send them away. You win.
Stefan! Stefan, stop! - Stop the car, Stefan!
get back in the car.
stay away from me!
Elena, get in the car. - How could you?!
my parents died going over this bridge. I almost died.
you knew that.
you're the one who saved me.
look, he had to believe that I would do it, all right? Your fear sold it.
well, what if he hadn't? - He did.
well, what if he hadn't? He did, Elena!
he backed down! He has a weakness!
if I know his weakness, I can destroy him!
after everything, that's what mattered, destroying Klaus?
destroying Klaus is all I have left.
you had me!
I lost you the minute I left town with him.
you just haven't let yourself admit that.
is that what you're doing?
trying to make me hate you?
I don't really care what you think about me anymore, Elena.
Tyler came to see me.
poor boy, he seemed quite distressed. He said Caroline had had a terrible accident.
you made him do this to her.
he would have never done something like this.
I'm here to help, Matt.
my blood will heal her. Please ask the sheriff to invite me inside.
I know how this game works.
you want something in return.
just your support.
come in.
are you going to kill me? - On your birthday?
do you really think that low of me? - Yes.
Oh, that looks bad.
my apologies. You're what's known as collateral damage. It's nothing personal.
I love birthdays. - Yeah.
aren't you like... a billion or something?
we have to adjust your perception of time when you become a vampire, Caroline.
celebrate the fact that you're no longer bound by trivial human conventions.
you're free. - No.
I'm dying.
and I could let you die if that's what you want.
if you really believe your existence has no meaning.
I've thought about it myself once or twice over the centuries, truth be told.
but I'll let you in on a little secret.
there's a whole world out there waiting for you, great cities and art and music...
genuine beauty.
and you can have all of it.
you can have a thousand more birthdays.
all you have to do is ask.
I don't want to die.
there you go, sweetheart. Have at it.
happy birthday, Caroline.
thanks for picking me up. - Anytime.
are you going to be ok?
I'll survive.
somehow I always do.
you know, Stefan won this round for us today.
he pushed Klaus over the edge. Klaus blinked.
well, his methods sucked. - Still, we needed it.
Klaus has been calling all the shots and Stefan beat him at his own game.
he was the better villain. - Don't sound so impressed.
well, can't help but feel a little proud.
really, tell me, are you going to be ok?
you can't kiss me again.
I know.
I can't.
it's not right. - It's right.
just not right now.
good night.
good night, Damon.
you're gonna have to let me go eventually.
be safe, ok? - Yeah, ok, all right.
Alaric's waiting, ok?
good, you haven't left yet.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I came to say goodbye.
from Klaus
you're not going to jump, are you?
thanks for coming.
I was just thinking about what you said, about us being stuck.
I was buzzed, Elena. I can't be held responsible for being judgmental.
I do feel stuck, Matt.
I feel like...
I've been holding on to the girl that was supposed to die here with her parents.
the girl that had a normal life and didn't fall in love with vampires.
you're not that girl anymore.
it's ok if you want to let her go.
is it?
because I feel like I've...
I've disappointed her a little, like...
like I've disappointed them, my parents.
my 2 cents...
as a guy who knew that little girl, you're doing a lot better than you think.
here lies Elena Gilbert, a fun girlfriend...
and an amazing friend.
thank God. - Another daydrinker.
I lost a patient. What's your excuse?
uh, well, I put a kid on a plane. - Yours?
no, that's a long story.
then you should probably buy me a beer.
a hiker called it in. My guys got here first.
another hybrid?
that's what I thought at first.
Brian Walters, the medical examiner.
what's up with the stake? He's not a vampire.
I know. This was a murder.
3 sleeping originals. 4 coffins.
who is in the locked box?
the coffin's open. - Mother.
it's an invitation."i think it's time we finally meet.
Damon won't let me anywhere near her without protection.
what do you need me to do?
better hurry up.
I upset the balance of nature by turning my children into vampires.
it's my duty to kill them.
so it's true. She's forgiven Klaus.
it's true.
if I hadn't asked Stefan to help, then you would have tried to be the hero, and you would have ruined everything.
I'm sorry for trying to keep you alive.
now you're mad at me for including Stefan?
no, I'm mad at you because I love you. - Maybe that's the problem.
Where's Damon?- being self-destructive.
I said something I didn't mean.
do you really not feel anything?
if I let myself care, all I feel is pain.
Stefan, hey.
it's me. I really have to talk to you.
please call me back.
what?
I called you 10 times last night.
we need to talk.
sorry. I've been busy.
if you're mad at me, Damon, you need to get over it.
Oh, I'm over it.
so let's not make a big deal out of this.
my thoughts exactly.
besides, I expect you'll come calling soon enough.
let's not hold our breath.
did you stop taking your vervain?
you think Rebekah had to compel me?
what's wrong with you? She tried to kill me less than 48 hours ago.
can't we just move past that, Elena?
so is that how it's gonna be now?
I hurt your feelings, and this is how you lash out at me?
well, maybe, for once, something I did had nothing to do with you.
you should know...
that Esther's planning on killing her entire family.
she's linked them all together with a spell.
whatever happens to one happens to all of them.
that's great. Klaus'll finally be dead. We win.
why do you look like someone just shot a panda bear?
because to kill Klaus, she has to kill all of them, including Elijah, and he doesn't deserve this.
I'm supposed to care about Elijah?
shouldn't you at least care about Rebekah?
2 seconds ago, you were pissed that she attacked you.
it's a win-win.
don't do anything to screw this up, Elena.
why are you doing this? - He's right, you know.
Klaus has to die. They all do.
see? Democracy in action.
there's our girl.
get out of my way, Kol.
out all night. What a scandal.
I trust you did better than that commoner.
Matt, was it?
if you don't shut your mouth, the next thing to come out of it will be your teeth.
don't start, Nik. - I didn't say anything.
I'm bored.
our sister is a strumpet, but at least she's having fun.
I need entertainment. - What are you waiting for?
go on. Have at it. - It's no fun to go alone.
join me, Nik.
it's the least you could do after sticking a dagger in my heart.
OK. Why not?
I didn't have nearly enough to drink last night, what with you trying to murder Rebekah's date.
Yes, please go. This house has enough men rolling around in it.
just like you, Bekah.
good riddance, both of you.
not you, too, Elijah.
I'm worried about mother. Have you not noticed her strange behavior?
she's been dead for a thousand years. What's strange for her?
burned sage.
she was doing a privacy spell.
you know she fancies such things. Why don't you ask Finn? He's been doting on her.
I don't trust Finn. He hates what we are. He always has.
that's not true.
and as for mother, she returned for one reason, to make her family whole.
she loves us. What trouble are you looking to find?
he was gloating, like actual gloat.
like he was proud of himself for sleeping with her.
is it working?
it's not working. I can hear every word you're saying about Damon, the vampire gigolo.
I don't know. It's a tricky spell.
when Esther did it, she kept the sage burning.
there was a lot more smoke.
all right, try it again.
speaking of Esther, you should know she came to see me and Abby this morning.
and all this time, you let me vent about Damon?
I don't want you to worry. - Ok, well, what did she want?
she wanted to introduce herself.
Abby and I helped bring her back.
she's channeling our entire ancestral bloodline for power.
I think she thought she was being po ok, well, is there a way to stop her from channeling you?
even if there was, why would I want that?
I just keep thinking...
before the sun and the moon ritual, Elijah found a way to keep me alive.
and now I'm in the exact same position, and I'm just gonna let him die?
it just doesn't feel right.
OK, first of all, this privacy spell is totally not working.
second, Elena, you are not doing this. Esther is doing this.
there's no time to change your mind, Elena.
he'll be dead by the end of the night.
what?
it's a full moon.
Esther needs to harness the energy of a celestial event.
she asked me and Abby to join her.
join me for a little victory drink?
we should wait until Klaus is dead.
why are you so extra broody? Didn't you see the way we stood up to Elena?
I like you on my team. Must have driven her nuts.
you still think she's gonna screw this up, don't you?
think somebody needs to talk to her. She's not gonna listen to anything I say.
is it because of your little sleepover?
it's not my fault she decided to get jealous.
well, given who you chose to sleep with, I would say it's 100% your fault.
whatever. Did you a favor.
now you can come in and sweep her off her feet.
Nah. She's better off without me.
sure as hell better off without you.
fine. Neither one of us gets her.
just make sure she doesn't screw up Esther's plan.
I don't mean to intrude.
I was hoping you might accompany me.
I want to show you something.
forgot how much I missed this land.
can't even imagine what it must have been like a thousand years ago.
you know, your school was built over an Indian village, where I saw my first werewolf.
the town square was where the natives would gather to worship.
matter of fact, near that was a
there was a field where wild horses used to graze.
that's incredible.
come.
do you know this place, too? - I do.
below us is a cavern I used to play in as a boy, connects to a system of tunnels that stretch across the entire area.
perhaps it's nature's way of providing us with shelter against the savagery of the full moon.
my mother said there must be a balance.
Elijah, I should probably go home. - I admire you, Elena.
you remind me of qualities I valued long before my mother turned us.
it's not in your nature to be deceitful, and yet when I asked you about your meeting with my mother the other night, you lied to my face.
that's not true. I told you that all your mother wanted was a new start.
I can hear your heartbeat.
it jumps when you're being dishonest with me.
you lied to me at the ball. You are lying to me now.
tell me the truth.
I never wanted this to happen.
what, Elena?
we were told that whatever was gonna be in that coffin was gonna kill Klaus.
when we found out that it was your mother...
we didn't know what to think.
since her return, she said she only wants this family whole again.
when she asked to see me, I-I thought that maybe she could help, that she would find a way to kill Klaus.
it's not just Klaus that she wants to kill.
she wants to kill us all, doesn't she?
she wants to undo the evil she created.
I'm so sorry, Elijah. I wish there was something I could do to help.
you know, one thing I've learned in my time on this earth...
be careful what you wish for.
I haven't seen Elena since this morning.
well, she's not answering her phone.
well, I'm surprised you have time to call, what with all this original sex you've been having.
she told you?
Oh, she told me. - Oh, really?
did she also tell you that she's having an attack of conscience about this whole original murder thing?
Hey, listen, I'm not gonna judge her for having a conscience.
well, you don't have to judge her. Just tie her up.
lock her in her room till this is over.
well, I wouldn't if I could, and I can't, because I'm busy.
busy doing what? - Don't worry about it.
are you with the sexy psycho doctor?
good-bye, Damon.
sorry about that.
does he still think i'm a serial killer?
he's a little judgmental.
speaking of...
your x-rays were inconclusive.
your knife wound was already semi-healed.
it's impossible to tell anything about whoever stabbed you.
short, tall, left-handed, right-handed-No clue.
well, what about my head? Why can't I remember anything about the attack?
your ct scans were clear.
maybe you were compelled to forget.
wait. You think the killer's a...Vampire?
there are no other suspects. It's the obvious conclusion.
Ah, come on now.
let's not go blaming the new family in town, just'cause you lot have got yourselves a killer at large.
don't mind us. My brother and I are just here to let off some steam. Right, Kol?
right.
who's the creepy, lurky guy?
that's Esther's son, Finn, and he's a vampire, so...
wonder what your grams thinks about the part we're playing in this balance of nature stuff?
she's probably on the other side screaming about getting involved with vampire business.
Bennett witches, thank you for coming.
I could think of no better allies than the woman who sent mikael into his long sleep and the girl who fought Niklaus so bravely.
why exactly did you invite us here?
you are the descendants of the witch Ayana.
she was a great mentor of mine, and I think it's only fitting that I draw from her bloodline.
so are you channeling our ancestors?
I draw from the entirety of the bennett bloodline, living and dead.
the connection affords me great power, although it is somewhat difficult to maintain, which is why I require you, mother and daughter, the bloodline made manifest.
tonight, my sisters, we shall bring peace to the spirits of nature that we serve, and for that, I thank you.
going somewhere?
what are you doing here?
not much, unless you try to run...
in which case, I get to kill you.
can't find her anywhere.
Hello, Stefan.
he has Elena.
actually she's with Rebekah.
as you can imagine, my sister's just dying to tear her throat out.
so if you want to save Elena's life, I need you to help me stop my mother.
I'm a little embarrassed to admit, but when it comes to killing thousand-year-old resurrected witches,
I'm a little rusty.
Yes, unfortunately even when killed, my mother doesn't seem to want to stay dead, not with the spirits of nature at her side.
so what are we supposed to do?
the witches that released my mother, she's drawing her power from their bloodline.
that line needs to be broken.
broken?
Yeah, he means...
you want us to kill them.
you know i'd do it myself, but I've absolutely no idea where they are.
besides, seeing me, they'd immediately know my intent.
they won't expect to be harmed by the likes of you.
in any case, you have until 6 minutes after 9: 00 to find them.
Oh, how superspecific of you.
by 9: 07, the moon'll be full.
my mother will have the power she needs to kill me and my family.
if you do not stop her before then, Rebekah will kill Elena.
so we all have our timeline.
I suggest you get started.
all right, love. Now look into the camera.
what are you doing?
shooting your picture to inspire your boyfriends.
why don't you tell them how delightful it is being stuck in a hole with your biggest fan?
I guess you think I had this coming, huh...
after what I did to you.
you know, I don't know what I want more, to find out we're Savedor to find out it's all right to kill you.
this isn't my fault.
I wanted to get rid of Klaus. At one point, so did you.
I didn't know that your mom was planning on killing all of you.
do you think I want to spend what could be the last few hours of my life having idle chitchat with a girl who literally stabbed me in the back?
of course not.
but for some reason, everybody seems to want to bend over backwards to save your life, which is incredibly annoying, but makes you the perfect hostage.
so why don't you sit down and shut upbefore I ruin everything by ripping your head off.
clock's ticking.
you gonna help me brainstorm a plan, or you too busy fixing a snack?
we need to call Bonnie.
there's gotta be a way for her to stop Esther from channeling all that power.
a," what if she's with Esther?
b," what if she can't cut her off?
c," I don't know how any of this stuff works, and,"d," neither do you.
you got a better plan?- Worst-case scenario, simple mechanics.
can't draw power from a dead battery.
kill 'em. - If it comes to that.
there's gotta be another way.
well, what if I told youI had a less diabolical plan?
you wanna dagger Elijah. - Well, they're all linked.
one goes down, they all go down. The witches live. Elena's safe.
problem solved. - We don't know how that'll affect Klaus.
ironically, Klaus isn't our current problem.
dagger's lethal to any vampire who uses one.
well, I just so happen to know someone crazy enough to give it a shot.
Yeah. No, they're still here.
Yeah. They've drank their way through half the grill's liquor supply.
good. It'll be easier if they're wasted.
so what's the plan? - Divide and conquer.
first we'll need a little blonde distraction.
I remember her from last night.
she looks like a tasty little thing.
say another word, and i'll tear out your liver.
it's you.
join us for a drink?
mm, I'd rather die of thirst, but thanks.
isn't she stunning?
she certainly looks good walking away from you.
I'll take that as a challenge.
Caroline! - Are you serious?
take a hint.
don't be angry, love. We had a little spat.
I'm over it already.
Ah, well, I'm not.
well, how can I acquit myself?
you and your expensive jewelry and your romantic drawings can leave me alone.
Oh, come on. Take a chance, Caroline.
talk to me.
come on. Get to know me.
I dare you.
fine.
so what do you want to talk about? - I want to talk about you.
your hopes. Your-your dreams.
everything you want in life.
just to be clear, i'm too smart to be seduced by you.
well, that's why I like you.
the pentagram represents our connection to magic.
the salt is a symbol of the earth.
and the torches?
5 torches, one for each of my children.
what's the spell you're doing?
as the witch who cast the spell that made them vampires, I can also reverse it.
when they become human again, they can be killed.
as they are linked as one, my brave Finn will be the sacrifice.
with his death will come theirs.
and you're just willing to die?
my mother's releasing me from an eternity of shame.
it's not a sacrifice. It's a gift.
a woman of your caliberought to choose more suitable company.
what's your name, love?
none of your business.
let's try that again. I'll start.
I'm Kol. - Why don't you get lost, Kol?
and why would I do that?
I like pretty little things with sharp tongues.
pretty sure she told you to get lost.
I'm pretty sure I don't care.
next time, take a hint.
something's wrong.
what is it?
what did you do? - Nothing.
what did you do? - I didn't do anything. Stop it.
here. Grab him.
tell the sexy doctor good work.
I should have killed you months ago. - Do it.
that's not gonna stop Esther from killing you.
what did you say about my mother?
you didn't know I was friends with your mummy?
Yeah, we have a lot in common.
she hates you as much as I do.
leave him!
we still need him, Niklaus.
what did mother do?
what did she do, Elijah?
you tell me where the witches are, or I'll have my sister kill Elena right now.
you told me we had until after 9: 00.
I'm sure Rebekah'd be more than happy to start her work early.
you can't hide, Elena!
not sure why I'm feeling under the weather.
must be your boys trying to find a loophole.
won't matter.
I could chase you down on my worst day.
boo.
you little bitch.
what is this?
sorry.
no vampires allowed.
no, no, no, no.
listen, Elena's still out there. I need to go find her.
shut up. Stay seated. You might have a concussion.
so this is your place, huh?
kind of a slob.
housekeeping is not high on my priority list.
I see that.
look at me.
pupillary response is normal.
you might have a broken rib.
well, that kind of sucks, getting my ass kicked on a date.
that's what you get picking fights with guys 30 times your age.
rest. Damon and Stefan are gonna take care of Elena.
I am going to take care of you.
so how do we know they're gonna be at the old witch house?
we don't, but if they're not, then we have about 10 minutes till Rebekah tears Elena apart.
and if we sit this out, Esther completes her spell, Klaus dies, you get your revenge.
it's what you wanted the whole time.
the only collateral damage is... - Elena.
you know what she'd choose.
she'd let herself be killed to save a friend. - yep.
if we do this, it'll wreck her.
Oh, she'll hate us.
thing is she only needs to hate one of us.
only one of us has to do the actual deed.
so who's it gonna be, brother?
well...
heads, I do it.
tails, you do it.
awful lot of effortfor someone who pretends not to care about her anymore.
pot, kettle, brother.
let's pick it up where we left off.
what are you doing?
thought I'd shake things up a bit.
are you insane?
I prefer spontaneous.
that's probably why Damon likes me so much.
here's what's gonna happen.
you're gonna come outside...
or you're gonna stay in there and burn.
the next match is landing on you.
so, Elena, how does it feel to know that these may be your last moments?
I don't know. You tell me.
you're the one whose mother is trying to kill you.
you should be very careful what you say to me.
you're still wearing her necklace.
do you want it? Is that your last request? Here.
it's all yours.
she's not doing this because she hates you, Rebekah.
she told me that she-She just doesn't have another choice.
spare me your pity, Elena.
we're not girlfriends.
you want me to prove it? Say the word.
you're not gonna do it. - And why is that?
because there's still a chance that you might be alive tomorrow, and if that's the case and you kill me now, you'll have used up all of your revenge, wasted it.
and isn't that what you want, revenge because I-I pretended to like youand then I stuck a dagger in your back?
I mean, that's why you slept with Damon, isn't it?
that's why you're tormenting me, because I hurt your feelings.
the tough act doesn't suit you. - I never said I was tough.
we both know that I'm right.
they're coming, mother.
no. It's too soon. The moon is not high enough.
go quickly.
my sons, come forward.
stay beside me. - It's ok.
they can't enter.
that's lovely.
we're stuck out here while the favorite son plays sacrificial lamb.
how pathetic you are, Finn.
be quiet, Kol. Your brother knows virtue you cannot even imagine.
whatever you think of us, killing your own children would be an atrocity.
my only regret is that I did notlet you die a thousand years ago.
enough.
all this talk is boring me.
end this now, mother, or I'll send you back to hell.
for a thousand years, I've been forced to watch you, felt the pain of every victim, suffered while you shed blood.
even you, Elijah, with your claim to nobility, you're no better.
all of you...
you're a curse on this earth stretched out over generations.
if you've come to plead for your life...
I'm sorry.
you've wasted your time.
this place has some serious vibe in it.
the witch spirits will protect us from the originals, but we should get into the basement.
Stefan, what's going on?
they took Elena. They're gonna kill her unless we stop Esther.
God, Stefan, I - I can't stop her.
she's channeling us.
Bonnie, if you can't stop her...
I have to find another way.
Stefan, no.
what are you gonna do?
even if you kill us, Esther's channeling every witch in our ancestry, living and dead.
Esther's drawing from the witches, and the only way to cut her off is if one of you is no longer a witch.
this'll only hurt a second.
no.
sisters, do not abandon me!
mother!
you can come out now.
seems your boys took care of the problem.
how did they do that?
Damon turned your witch friend's mother into a vampire.
what? - Quite clever, actually.
they needed to sever the witch line, and, well, you can't be a witch and a vampire.
in any case, you're free to go.
Oh, and, uh, by the way, you were right.
I do prefer taking my time watching you suffer.
much more satisfying.
she doesn't want to see you.
please just let me talk to her.
Abby's in transition.
it's gonna be really hard over the next few days, and if Bonnie needs some time to deal, then I think you should give it to her.
she's always been there for me, Caroline.
please let me just be there for her, too.
I'm sorry, Elena.
I know that you want to help, but put yourself in her shoes.
everything that happened tonight was to save you.
and that's ok, because she loves you so much.
but somehow she's always the one who gets hurt.
Yeah. You're right.
I just-Just tell her that I love her, ok?
of course I will.
is she safe?
Elijah kept his word.
rebekah let her go. - Good.
all's right in the world again.
I lost that coin toss, Damon.
should have been me who turned Abby.
why'd you do it? - 'cause I'm not blind.
I see what's been going on around here.
you're hanging by a thread, Stefan, barely over your last ripper binge, and all you want is to be the old Stefan again.
that part of me is gone for good. - Oh, yeah?
how long has it been since you had a drop of human blood?
how'd you know?
spend 146 years with someone, you kind of start to pick up on their tells.
answer the question. How long has it been since your last drink?
since the night I threatened to drive Elena off the wickery bridge.
see? You have enough to feel guilty about.
why add to the list?
by the way, you're welcome.
you know, you're not fooling anyone either.
you still love her, Damon.
I do.
I thought I could win her from you fair and square.
she didn't want me.
it's for the best.
I'm better at being the bad guy anyway.
Elena, today I did things I abhor to protect the one thing I value most, my family.
if anyone can understand it, it's you.
your compassion is a gift, Elena.
carry it with you, as I will carry my regret.
always and forever, Elijah.
where the bloody hell is everyone?
it's over, Rebekah.
Where's mother?
we have no mother, only Esther, and Esther was right.
what do you mean?
all my talk of virtue, when it suits my needs, I kill, maim, and torment.
even today, I terrorized an innocent.
Elena is hardly innocent.
and I used your hatred of her to get what I wanted...
wielded you like I would a sword...
my sister.
you did it to protect us, Elijah, and rightly so.
we deserve to live. We are better than they are. - Are we?
mother made us vampires.
she didn't make us monsters. We did that to ourselves.
I thought you'd have gone by now.
Elijah's leaving. Kol's fled.
Esther and Finn are gone, too.
I hated you when I learned you killed our mother...
but I realize now that after a thousand years together as a family, you're the only one who never left me.
well, aren't we a pair?
there's something I think you need to see.
come to brag about your skills as a torturer?
look at the images on the wall behind Elena.
the natives told the story of our family history.
look at the images on the far wall.
what is it?
a native worshipping at the great white oak tree.
And?
we burnt that tree to the ground.
look at the markings that precede it.
that's the native calendar.
this can't be right.
a white oak tree 300 years after we fled back to the old world.
there must have been a sapling, a new tree to replace the old.
that tree could kill us, Nik. It's not over.
you weren't supposed to see that.
does Elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar?
I love you. But look me in the eye and tell me that you don't feel something for him.
to break the sire bond, you've got make yourself turn.
I just turned about a hundred times in the Appalachian mountains.
won't know if it's broken for sure until I test it.
if you are to kill all of my children,
I will need to bind your ring to the stake, rendering the white oak indestructible.
what are you doing with him?
I'm going to remake him.
make him strong, fast.
a true hunter.
Aaah! Oh!
I'm not going to complete the transition.
we're just going to lock you in here and let you die?
I can't be a vampire.
what do you mean, you're ditching my clean-up committee?
Klaus called. He's leaving town and wants me to pack up his house.
well, since when does sire bond equal mover slave?
since he realized you're not going to dump me for him.
he's being petty.
and he still thinks I'm sired to him.
it's fine. I'll keep up the act and it will all be over soon.
I'm late. I've got to go. I love you.
I love you, too.
Hello?
Where's Matt?
he bailed.
got called into work at the last minute.
are you kidding me?
so it's just us?
Yes, and you're late.
clean-up committee started at 8: 00.
it's like 8: 02. - Exactly.
I managed to turn up on time and I didn't even get to attend the dance that I organized.
I'm sorry about your mom.
I mean, I know you, like, you hated her and everything, but still.
I'm sorry.
sorry about your teacher.
he seemed like a nice guy.
Yeah. He was.
I'm going to get started on the gym.
you're supposed to be dead. - I am.
going darker, huh?
it's the only color we had.
that's what happens when you decide to paint your dead guardian's room in the middle of the night.
I don't suppose anyone tried to talk you guys out of doing this... So soon.
we have to keep moving.
otherwise we'll start thinking.
and we don't want to think. - You want a hand?
so are you two, like, back together or something?
what? No, Jerm, we're just...
I was just checking up on you guys, seeing how you were doing.
after, uh... After everything.
we're fine. But, if you are trying to be the good guy again, why don't you do the right thing and give us one day.
just one day without any vampires in it.
he didn't mean that.
yeah... Yeah, he did.
I'll get that.
we have a problem.
Alaric Saltzman just tried to kill me.
Alaric Saltzman is supposed to be dead.
well, he's not! And he's a vampire thanks to mother's spell.
with a white oak stake that can't kill him.
he's stronger, Nick. Too strong.
where is he now?
stuck at the school without a daylight ring, but as soon as night falls, he'll come after us.
we need to leave now.
fine.
I'll collect Elena and we'll be on our way.
forget Elena! You don't need any more stupid hybrids!
what I need is protection from Esther's continued assaults against us.
we'll protect each other, like we always have.
always and forever, Nik.
I'm not leaving without her.
I'm leaving now.
you can either walk out that door with me or you are on your own.
fine.
trust your hybrids over your family.
let your spite be the death of you. See if I care.
move it, sire boy.
what's her deal?
what do you mean, he turned?
I thought you were standing guard.
don't blame me! Blame Bonnie the blood bank.
she fed him.
I had no idea what was happening.
OK, the witches led me there.
they wanted him to feed so he'd turn.
so where's the stake now?
Oh, you mean the white oak one?
the one that can kill an original and wipe out an entire line of vampires?
we don't know. - If you are so upset with me, why did you feed me your blood to save my life?
because I do stupid things, Bonnie.
I do things, like let my friend die with dignity when I should have just killed him.
all right, so how do we kill him now?
I've been trying to figure that out.
a witch can't truly make an immortal creature.
there's always a way to undo a spell.
so?
what's the witchy workaround?
that's the problem.
I don't know.
whoever this is, it's not funny.
who else would it be?
Ric?
listen closely. I'm at the school.
I have Caroline.
and if you want to keep her alive,
I need you to get into your car and come down here right away.
if you tell anyone where you are going,
I will kill her.
what the hell do you want?
now is that any way to treat a guest?
what are you doing here, Klaus?
well, for starters, young Jeremy here could show some manners and invite me inside.
why don't you go up to your room.
now.
hmm. Poor lad.
loses one questionable father figure only to be replaced by the likes of the two of you.
Yeah, about that. Something happened.
Oh, I know all about my mother's invulnerable little creation.
that's why I'm here. I'm leaving town.
I just need to pick up a few road trip necessities.
spare tire, flashlight...
doppelganger.
can't help you there.
Elena!
where is she?
I don't know. She was just here a few minutes ago.
where is she?
she's not here.
what do you mean, she's not here?
where did she go?! - What's going on?
Klaus wants in.
we have to keep him out.
duck!
right on time.
Caroline!
let her go, Alaric.
free her yourself.
Hey.
you said that you would let her go!
how many times do I have to tell you, Elena?
stop trusting vampires!
think you're probably going to want to let me in.
Elena's car is gone.
why wouldn't she tell anyone where she was going?
get down! Missed me!
missed me again!
Alaric.
put it out.
come outside and make me.
Elena's not here. Alaric has her and Caroline.
he's going to kill them both unless you turn yourself over to him.
now I know you're not asking me to walk into a certain death.
I really wish we could.
but unfortunately, if Alaric kills you, there's a one in four chance that we die, too.
I'll take those odds.
and a hundred percent chance that Tyler dies.
I'm good with that, too.
why don't we just figure out a way to put Alaric down, hmm?
OK. How about Damon sneaks in and distracts Alaric while Stefan grabs Elena and carries her to safety.
Oh, that's a great idea. What's to stop me from being killed instantly?
nothing. - Caroline's in there.
don't you have a thing for her, or did she just reject you too many times?
this isn't really, uh, helping too much.
I might have an idea.
my mom used a desiccation spell on Mikael that immobilized him for over 15 years.
if I can get it, I might be able to use it on Alaric.
if and might. Your words inspire such confidence.
I'll get it. But even with the spell, we'll need a lot of vampire muscle to take him down.
including yours.
just so we're clear, the sun sets in about eight hours.
we don't succeed before then,
Elena will be dead, I'll be gone, and the rest of you will be left to fend for yourselves.
no, don't, please don't.
Alaric, stop!
sit down!
this keeps the vervain in her system.
it's like inhaling razor blades with every breath.
why are you doing this?
to make it easier on you when you put her out of her misery.
what? No!
isn't this what you wanted, Elena? For me to teach you how to kill a vampire?
well, here's a vampire, Elena.
kill her.
this isn't what I want. - Of course it is.
all those hours you spent training, getting stronger...
you could be a hunter, Elena.
but you've never actually staked a vampire through the heart.
well, this is promising.
relax.
Abby will be here.
I'm sorry. I forgot about her stellar track record in the dependability department.
jamie said she was coming, OK?
just... Give her time.
don't get your hopes up. Might be a girl scout.
Hello, Bonnie.
thanks for coming.
Jamie's worried about you.
he said it was urgent.
I just didn't think you'd ever want to see me again.
like Jamie said...
it's urgent.
Abby just showed up.
good. Perhaps this plan won't be an epic failure after all.
you know, if this does go off and we drop the history teacher in the Atlantic,
I'm still leaving with Elena.
I'll go with you.
Really?
what's the catch?
there's no catch.
I turn my back on everything here to make sure Elena's safe.
and that is what makes you her better option.
it's a shame it's not easier for Elena to see that.
I mean, personally, I think she's wasting her time with Damon.
you know, all this time and energy you spend trying to get me and my brother to hate each other...
it's actually had the opposite effect.
has it? Has it really?
well, then perhaps I should let Elena decide which Salvatore joins us.
I mean, if you and Damon are so close.
Ah, go for it.
Damon and I have been through a hell of a lot worse than you.
why didn't I have to be invited in?
only vampires live here.
we had signed over the deed to Elena, but she died and the seal broke.
and... It's a very long story.
blood?
Oh, come on.
think of it as a peace offering.
fine.
more for me.
we called you here because I need help with a spell.
Esther created a vampire that can't be killed.
I want to desiccate him like you did to Mikael.
Bonnie... It's too dangerous.
your magic comes from the earth.
it's pure.
this spell asks you to tap into dark places.
places of temptation.
places you can't handle.
you turned your back on me for 16 years.
you have no idea what I can handle.
got to say I'm team Bonnie on this one.
how hard can it be to parch a vampire?
the spell allows you to stop a vampire's heart.
the blood will stop flowing, and his body will dissociate.
that's exactly what we want to do.
to stop a vampire's heart, you need to find a balance among the living.
can you handle that?
what? What does that mean? Bonnie, I don't speak witch.
I have to stop a human heart.
I just got this.
it connects me to Caroline and Elena through our phones.
they're in Alaric's classroom.
you should go in from the South entrance.
digital locator spell.
why the hell do we need you, then?
hand it over.
I'm not giving you my ring. Let me do this.
by my math, you've already bit it once, possibly twice, wearing that thing, and if for some reason
Bonnie can't restore your heart and you do indeed die, then before you know it, we have another psycho alter ego case on our hands.
which is bad. So give me the ring.
this is my ring, Elena's my sister.
no one's going to fight harder for her than me.
fine. Stubborn.
try not to kill him.
look at this.
one big happy family.
drink this.
it's my blood. It Bridges us all together so that when I stop Jeremy's heart, you'll have the power to stop Alaric's.
you need to make a physical connection to his bloodstream...
a vein, artery, something connected to his heart.
one of us gets a clean shot, take it, the other two hold him down.
before we all walk through these doors, let's get on the same page, shall we?
I was the one who created your vampire bloodline, therefore I am responsible for your lives.
and Tyler's life, Caroline's life, and, of course, Abby's life.
should anything go wrong.
or you're just lying to save your ass.
I'm not lying. Go ahead, call my bluff.
let the teacher kill me. You'll all be dead soon thereafter.
let's just get this over with, shall we?
why are you doing this?
because you need me.
because you're an 18-year-old girl without parents or guidance or any sense - of right and wrong anymore. - Look at you.
how is this right?
she's a murderer.
she told me she killed someone and liked it.
now how is that right?
see, Elena...
your parents led the council.
it was their life's mission to keep this town safe.
they weren't dead six months before you undid it all.
you don't know anything about them.
why, am I wrong? Do you actually think...
that they'd be proud of you?
if you don't side with the humans...
you're just as bad as them.
now kill her.
or I'll do it for you.
and I'll make it hurt.
I thought I taught you better than that.
you did.
get help!
it's OK, it's OK.
it's me. It's OK. You're safe.
we'll save Elena.
you go straight home, you stay inside, you understand?
do you understand me?
thank you.
I should kill you.
I should gut you like Brian Walters,
bill Forbes and all the other cowards
I plan on ripping apart. You're the worst offender of them all, Elena.
you don't deserve to live.
so then why am I still alive?
there's obviously no humanity left in you.
so what's stopping you, Alaric?
if you want me dead, then kill me!
do it! Kill me!
do it now!
they made contact.
it's happening.
Aaah!
what's wrong?
something happened. The connection broke.
stop! Let him go or I'll kill myself.
put it down, Elena. - Why?
because you still need me alive?
there's a reason why Esther used me to make you, isn't there?
she didn't want you to be immortal.
so she tied your life to a human one... mine.
that way, you have only one lifespan to kill all vampires, and then you'll be gone.
so when I die, you die, too. That's it!
it has to be.
you're wrong.
am I?
stop, stop, stop, stop!
Oh, be careful.
moving only makes it hurt more.
what are you doing?
draining you of all your blood.
Elena?
Tyler! Help me!
he can't.
he needs to go fetch me more empty blood bags.
about three liters worth, please, Tyler.
Tyler, please...
get Stefan.
please.
no, Tyler, get the bags.
forget the girl and get the bags.
now.
so that's it?
you're just going to bleed me dry?
Yes. But don't worry.
it'll be completely painless.
as the last drop is drawn, you'll simply fall asleep.
Ugh, why am I still alive?
get up.
I said get up!
Klaus is going to kill Elena.
what?
what are you talking about?
Klaus needs Elena's blood to make hybrids.
she's the last person that he'd kill.
the witch bound my life to Elena's.
if she dies, I die.
Klaus figured that out, and now he's taken her.
now I'm trapped here until the sun goes down, so you two better get to what you do best...
saving Elena's life.
what about your hybrids?
you'll need more than this to create your army.
these last few liters will have to suffice.
you see...
by attempting to kill us, my mother strengthened the bond between my siblings and I.
I don't need hybrids.
I have my family.
if you believe that, then why take my blood at all?
you want a back-up family.
you know that your siblings will never trust you again.
you know Stefan blames me for trying to tear him from his brother?
but I think we both know who really came between them.
you.
that's why you won't choose.
you know once you pick a Salvatore, you'll destroy their bond.
consider this me doing you a favor.
once you're dead, you won't have to choose.
no broken hearts.
their family stays intact.
but just between us girls, who would you have picked?
rot in hell.
hmm.
you're welcome.
sweet dreams, Elena.
that's been fun.
what are you doing? - Shh.
Tyler...
so much for that sire bond.
I'm not your little bitch anymore.
how did you break the sire bond?
by breaking every bone in my body a hundred times for the girl I love.
that's impossible.
is it? Or maybe real love is stronger than fake loyalty.
but what would you know about that?
you know, you should be thanking me.
I gave you a gift, I took away your misery.
you didn't give a crap about me!
you just didn't want to be alone.
good-bye, Tyler.
Hey. Are you OK?
come on.
Oh, my God! Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
we should get her home before the sun sets.
Heh. You two are really going to walk me all the way to the door, aren't you?
you lost a lot of blood today.
Yeah, I know, but I told you, I'm fine.
I just... I have a little headache.
Yeah, but the sun's about to go down and Ric's going to be able to terrorize the streets any minute.
Yeah, but he can't hurt me.
it's you two we should be worrying about.
he won't be able to find us.
I'll, uh...
I'll call you when we get back.
I know it's selfish.
I... I know that it seems like I'm stringing you both along, but I don't... I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I mean...
if I choose one of you, then I lose the other.
and I've lost so many people, I just...
I can't bear the thought of losing one of you.
Ah, it's, uh...
it's been a long day.
we'll call you from the road.
after we dump Klaus' body in the lake.
just... be careful.
both of you.
what are you guys doing here?
welcome to our victory party!
what victory?
we failed. Alaric's still out there.
we know. But we've been trying to get rid of Klaus forever and Caroline convinced us to enjoy it... for a night.
got to be honest... I'm a little pissed none of you let me take down original brother number two.
Yeah, he would have taken you right down to the hospital, bro.
please, I'm more stealth than that. I'm like a ninja.
you wish. - Here.
you need this.
I heard. And you know that sooner or later, you're going to have to choose, right?
I know.
Hey. Give me your hand.
thank you for standing up to Klaus like that.
let's just say it's been a long time coming.
way too long.
all right, let's drink.
I do not condone this, by the way.
you survived Klaus. All right, make an exception.
you can go back to being responsible tomorrow.
OK. - Hang on.
do you guys hear that?
that is the sound of a Klaus-free life.
to a Klaus-free life.
and to all of you.
my family. - Cheers!
Carol. What's so urgent you called an emergency council meeting at this hour?
I didn't call the meeting, Liz.
he did.
join us, Sheriff.
I was just telling the council about our vampire problem.
or should I say, your problem.
what do you think you're doing?
well, perhaps you and the mayor can enlighten the group. On the strides you've taken to eliminate the issue.
Oh, that's right... you haven't.
you see, the sheriff, the woman we elected to keep our families safe and town secure has a vampire for a daughter.
and our lovely mayor, a son who is half-vampire, half-werewolf.
why are you doing this?
these women are hypocrites.
they claim to spearhead our defense against a supernatural presence, then cover up the violent attacks committed by their own children.
that's enough. We're done here. It's time to go.
sit down, Liz.
we're just getting started.
what?
how many desiccated hybrids does it take to screw in a light bulb?
you're in a good mood.
Yeah, I'm in a good mood.
Klaus is dead, my brother's halfway sane...
again.
give or take an immortal hunter that wants to kill us.
we won, Stefan.
come on, say it.
say it! - We won.
once more, with feeling!
we won.
thank you.
no, you know what, thank you.
turns out we make a pretty good team, huh?
it only took a century and a half.
what happens when, uh...
Elena makes her decision?
you know how these things pan out, Stefan.
she'll probably make a list of pros and cons and at the end of the day, dump both our asses.
what if she doesn't?
then she'll pick one of us.
well, if she chooses you...
I'll leave town and let you two be happy and not be bothered by me.
and in 60 years, we'll go back to being brothers and none of this will have mattered, right?
Yeah.
fine.
if she chooses you, I'll... leave town, too.
all this over one girl.
she's a pretty special girl.
Yes, she is.
Hey. Everyone gone?
it's just us.
I hate this room.
me, too.
mom and dad were right.
Alaric should just kill all the vampires and put an end to all of this.
but then that means that Caroline dies.
and Bonnie loses her mom.
the mayor loses her son, and I lose Stefan and Damon.
so if it makes me the bad guy for wanting to keep those people alive, then fine. I'll be the bad guy.
you forget that Alaric never wanted any of this.
once he carries out his plans, what if he decides he doesn't want to live anymore?
and he kills his human connection to end his life.
that would mean I would lose you.
I'm not going to let that happen.
I'm going to shower and get some sleep.
good night, Elena.
good night.
I can't. I can't. I can't.
turn it off.
she's ruthless without her humanity, Damon.
when Silas was buried by the witch Qetsiyah, she left him with the cure.
she knew that he wanted to die, be reunited with his one true love.
Bonnie is the one that can drop the veil between this side and the other side.
you will open the floodgates for every supernatural being that has ever died.
silas, show me your real face.
now, why would I do that when I can look like whomever I want you to see?
so what are we gonna do?
lock her up, make her life a living hell.
you boys want to play games?
let's see who breaks first.
Elena, you're here. Hey, I got valedictorian.
you can help me write my speech.
pass. - Oh, come on.
we're graduating this year. This is it.
we're gonna have to soak up every second before...
wait. Something is not right. I don't want to be here.
what is wrong with you?
don't you want to be with your friends, graduation parties, caps, gowns? You know the drill.
what is this?
we're not really here, are we?
we're in my head. - Relax.
I just want to show you all the things you've been missing out on since you took the giant leap over the cuckoo's nest.
last thing I remember...
let me guess. Prom...
beautiful dress, gorgeous hair, you trying to murder Bonnie.
it's a good thing I was there to take care of you.
you starved me, you and Stefan. - Yeah. Well, we had to keep you weak so I could bring you here.
see, the way I figure it is, if I can make you nostalgic, then you're already halfway to getting your humanity back.
it's not gonna work, Damon.
well, there are other ways to provoke an emotional response.
you still have her locked in the safe?
you've been in her head for an hour.
what, still nothing?
how you doing in there?
come on.
is the old you ready to come out and play?
go to hell.
OK. Back you go.
we can do this the nice way, or we can do it the other way, but either way, we're not stopping until you turn your humanity switch back on.
so I'm gonna let you think about that, and I'm gonna come back for you in a couple hours or a couple years because all we have is time.
where is she? I want to see her.
we're not letting anyone see her. That's the whole point.
isolation leads to misery, leads to emotion.
she's been here for days. She hasn't improved at all?
look. She doesn't want to, Caroline, not yet, all right?
she's devastated. She lost her brother.
she attacked her friends. She killed an innocent woman.
you said that you knew how to help her.
I did say that. We are. - How, by torturing her?
it's not torture. It's an intervention.
the only chance we have with her is to provoke her, to trigger something...
fear, anger, self-pity, anything.
let me talk to her before any more interventioning.
if she's weak, she can't hurt me.
please just let me try.
good luck.
I brought you something.
it doesn't have any vervain in it, I swear.
I just figured a little blood might help you think straight.
for the record, I don't agree with what they're doing.
I mean, I agree that you need to turn your humanity back on, but I don't think that making you suffer is the way to do it.
that's not who you are.
what makes you such an expert on who I am?
because we've been friends forever.
I tried to kill you, Caroline.
I'm not exactly BFF material anymore.
you should move on.
I am not going to give up on you.
this annoying, clingy thing that you're doing, did it ever occur to you maybe that's why both your boyfriends skipped town?
I mean, I know that Tyler said he was running for his life.
maybe he was running from you.
and Klaus... I mean, let's just say it.
nobody likes a tease.
Hey, I'm not judging.
might be nice to have a bad boy ruffle those perfect feathers.
you're in pain. You're lashing out.
I get it, but you can't stay this way forever.
we're about to graduate and start new lives, and you deserve...
are you seriously talking about High-School graduation?
Caroline, do you realize how pathetic you're gonna look in that cap and gown pretending to be human while your mom fake-smiles and just counts down the minutes until you leave town so that you can stop being a reminder that her daughter is a repulsive, blood-sucking, control freak monster?
it's really too bad Stefan stopped me before I put you out of your misery, but, hey, here's to second chances. Elena?
do whatever you have to do.
I'm gonna be upstairs.
I was wondering if you were gonna say hello or keep ignoring me.
I was working.
I see you compelled the bartenders again.
I'm celebrating.
my brothers and I have parted company.
Elijah and Nik have run off to New Orleans chasing God knows what, and I am finally free.
Yeah. I heard about that.
did you hear that I lost the cure to Silas?
I was this close to the life that I always wanted, and then, poof, gone in a heartbeat.
I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted it.
please. I know you were planning on stealing it for Elena.
I never had a chance, did I? - I meant what I said, but if you want to feel sorry for yourself, go ahead.
why don't you stay and have a drink? - I can't.
I've got to go meet Caroline.
are they still keeping Elena trapped in the Salvatore mansion?
I happen to like her just the way she is.
it's tragic that they're trying so desperately to fix something that isn't broken.
Elena was my friend long before she was your mean-girl sidekick.
so if you're upset that you lost the cure and your brothers ditched you, why are you still in Mystic Falls?
some of us don't have the option of leaving.
some of us are broke and failing all of our classes and stuck here.
so why don't you take your freedom and get the hell out of town?
I would.
Bonnie, where have you been?
I left you, like, 90 million messages.
studying French.
we still have final exams, remember?
Oh, don't remind me. Look.
this whole thing with Elena, it's about to get brutal, and I know that she's not your favorite person right now, but I could really use you over here.
for what, moral support or so you can check up on me?
moral support and maybe just a tiny check-in to make sure that Silas isn't playing any more pesky little mind games with you.
I'm fine, ok?
Silas doesn't control me anymore.
and I think I'll pass on the invite.
Elena tried to kill me.
I'm not quite ready to forgive and forget.
I'm gonna call you later, ok?
I got to go.
lying, scheming, and a secret rendezvous with moi?
not very Bonnie Bennett-y, especially when Elena needs her favorite witch.
this has nothing to do with them. This is between you and me.
all right. Well, luckily for you,
I've got some spare time on my hands.
you said you have an offer that I can't refuse.
well, by all means.
what do you have in mind?
good. You're awake.
we thought you could use a little sunshine.
looking for this?
Aw. You know the rules.
bad girls don't get nice jewelry.
you took my ring. I'm devastated.
and bored.
can I go back to solitary now?
no. I kind of like you in the hot seat.
whenever you're ready, brother.
am I supposed to be scared?
you will be.
and when you are, focus on that fear.
it's the key to getting your humanity back.
you're not gonna burn me.
you don't think so? - No.
and even if you do manage to get my emotions back,
I'll remember all this.
and I'll hate both of you for it.
tsk. Worth the risk.
that feels better, huh?
how about a little gratitude or any human emotion whatsoever?
and we can stop this.
I didn't quite catch that.
I said, I'm gonna kill you.
bingo. See? There's a little rage.
I should have figured that'd be the first emotion that came out of you.
I tend to pull that out of people.
Elena, look at me. We don't want to do this, ok?
you can stop this right now. It's your choice.
kind of funny, actually, you being the one to pull back the curtain.
I bet part of you enjoys it since, you know, I dumped you and all.
Wow. That was downright vindictive.
see? I think now we're breaking through that tough candy shell and getting into the ooey-gooey rich center of your humanity.
this is good. I think we should shine some light on the subject.
let me guess...
this is gonna hurt you a lot more than it hurts me.
look, I know what you're going through.
after all you've done, you're afraid to face the guilt you'll feel if you turned your emotions back on.
the only way we can help you is to make the alternative hurt even worse.
Oh, we have to keep talking. If we don't keep talking, then I won't be able to stop myself from listening in.
and I can't stand to hear Elena in pain.
what do you want to talk about? - I don't know. Anything.
I ordered you a cap and gown. - You did?
I just figured that you'd forget, so I ordered yours when I ordered mine.
and I got one for Elena, too.
it's gonna work.
we're gonna get Elena back.
what the hell is she doing here?
Hi.
I don't mean to interfere.
it's just I happen to know all they keep in this house is blood and booze.
so I brought a peace offering. Burgers?
Thanks.
Yeah, we can't really entertain right now, - but thanks for stopping by. - I think I might stay.
Matt mentioned that he was failing classes and needed a study buddy.
you're failing?
well, why didn't you ask me to help you study?
well, I didn't exactly ask her. - Well, what classes are you failing?
I'm not failing. I'm just really, really behind.
history and Italian and math. - Matt!
this year's been a little distracting.
we could both help. "All hands on deck."
that's the motto around here, right? - We don't have a motto.
look, if you need to study, we're gonna study.
I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna get my flash cards and my study guides and some energy bars.
this is gonna be good.
you dated that? - She likes projects.
who's there?
Oh, my God. - Hello, Caroline.
let me get this straight.
you want me to hand over Silas' tombstone?
what makes you think I even have it?
I know you took it from the island.
you're a scavenger. You'd never leave it behind.
so you're working for Silas now, huh?
running errands for the big, bad immortal.
I didn't switch sides.
in two days, there'll be a full moon.
Silas wants me to harness its power to drop the veil between our side and the other side.
he wants to take the cure, and then he wants to die.
I said I'd help him, and I've been hiding from him ever since, buying time.
time for what? - You don't need to worry about it.
you just need to bring me the tombstone.
it's a hunk of rock.
what do you even want with it? - The less you know, the better.
Silas is psychic.
he can get into people's heads, read their minds, make them see things that aren't really there.
I'm taking a big enough risk just talking to you.
OK. Then how do I know that you're not him?
you don't. But I'm not.
and what makes you so sure that I'm not him?
because he can't get into my head anymore.
because I am the only one who can see his true face.
what's in it for me?
bring me the tombstone.
help me stop Silas from unleashing hell on earth.
believe me, I'll make it worth your while.
you're gonna thank me for this.
after you turn it back on, you'll realize life with no emotions blew.
you know what else blew? Being sired to you.
going every day believing that I was in love with you.
I remember every horrible moment of it.
and you... So scared that it wasn't real.
well, guess what. It wasn't.
you were right.
so go ahead. Keep trying to get the old me back.
who knows? Maybe Stefan and I will give it another go.
I am the girl that you love.
you wouldn't do anything to actually hurt me.
you just proved that.
so what do I really have to be afraid of?
so that went well.
every other vampire turns it on, no problem.
you kill. You feed.
you do all the awful things that a vampire does.
and then when you're done, you turn it back on.
why is she being so stubborn?
because she has nothing to come back to.
her home's gone. Her family's gone.
she alienated her friends. She destroyed her relationships.
no. She wants to come back.
scaring the hell out of her should have worked.
she's smart. She knows we're not gonna hurt her.
all right. So we get somebody else, somebody who really will hurt her.
who?
Katherine? - Think about it.
she's the reason Jeremy's dead, right?
so if anybody's gonna provoke an emotion, it's her.
so we call her and then what?
beg her to help us out of the kindness of her own heart?
you kidding me?
Katherine was just abandoned by Elijah.
she has nothing. She has no one.
we invite her into our house to come torture Elena.
there's no way she's gonna turn that down.
everyone said that you were gone for good.
that's true.
but I never meant to go without saying good-bye.
you don't owe me an explanation.
you're moving on. By all means, go.
well, that's just it, isn't it?
I never had any intention of moving on.
the truth is, I've tried to stop thinking about you.
and I can't.
come to New Orleans.
what are you afraid of? - You!
I'm afraid of you.
wouldn't it be more accurate to say you're afraid of yourself, your darkest desires?
Elena was right, wasn't she?
deep down, you long to have your perfect feathers ruffled.
how do you know what Elena said to me in that cell?
then again...There's so much to be afraid of, isn't there, like what I'll do to you if your friend Bonnie doesn't come out of hiding.
where is she?
Silas. - Where is she?!
she's not at home. She's not anywhere.
Bonnie is playing games with me. And I don't like it.
tell her I'm looking for her.
tell her to come out of the shadows.
tell her that this...
is only the beginning.
what time will Caroline return from the train station?
well, that's handy. Sort of a cheat, though, isn't it?
not everyone's had a thousand years to learn everything about everything.
I'm not sure how good I am at learning Italian.
I was fluent in the 12th century, but languages have a way of evolving.
so can you help or not?
of course I can.
don't be cranky. I was just teasing.
I'm sorry. I just don't want to get left behind when all my friends go to college and I'm the only repeat senior.
the only reason that you are failing is because you're preoccupied with training doomed hunters and dealing with Elena's drama.
you need better friends, like me.
I could compel you good grades, get a scholarship.
I don't want to do that.
why not? Everyone needs an advantage in life.
I could be yours.
when you convinced me to save April Young's life at the prom,
I realized that I could be a better person.
and I'm grateful for that.
so let me give you some advice.
take advantage of what I'm offering you.
make something of yourself.
for the record, anyone who leaves you behind is a fool.
I wouldn't.
what a beautiful sentiment.
Seriously? You can't knock?
sorry. I didn't realize we were standing on formalities.
what the hell are you doing here? - You didn't get the memo?
I'm here to talk some sense into poor emotionless Elena.
are you out of your mind? - You got a better idea, prom King?
unless you want me to lock you up in there with her,
I suggest you shut up and let the adults handle this.
well, it looks like the lunatics have taken over the asylum.
where are you going? - I'm calling Caroline.
there's no way we're letting that psycho in there with Elena.
where have you been? - Matt!
we have to get out of here.
no, Caroline. Caroline, wait. It's ok.
no, it's not ok.
Silas is out there.
and he made me think that he was Klaus...
what are you talking about? What's Silas want with you?
he's trying to get to Bonnie.
do you know where Bonnie is?
if I knew where she was, I wouldn't bother with you.
now, get me Bonnie, or I'm going to kill someone.
maybe I'll start with your mother.
no one in the house can help you.
find Bonnie or I'll kill the person you love the most.
I know. I promised I wouldn't work too late.
mom, I need you to get home and lock all the doors right now.
don't let anyone inside, not even me because I have a key, so I can let myself in. Do you understand?
what's going on? - Just do it, OK? I'm on my way.
Oh, honey, you look awful.
what the hell are you doing here? - Your boyfriends invited me.
they want to know if you still have a heart.
there it is.
your bodyguards won't let me kill you, but I can rip your throat out.
so I don't have to listen to you whine.
but first, satisfy my curiosity.
what did you tell Elijah back in Willoughby?
that's why you're here.
he dumped you, didn't he?
now you're just looking for a scapegoat.
tell me what you said to turn him against me or I will feed you your own eyeballs.
I didn't have to say anything.
look at you.
a self-obsessed egomaniac on the run for 5 centuries.
what good would you be to anyone?
you're the definition of damaged goods.
no wonder Elijah left you.
Yeah, I've done some pretty horrible things to survive.
but unlike you, poor, delicate Elena,
I don't turn it off. I deal with it.
you wouldn't last a week as a vampire without everyone fawning over you.
but I'd love to see you try.
all that pain and torture of her took quite a thirst.
it couldn't have anything to do with the fact that Elena called you out on your recent boy trouble, could it?
sorry. I couldn't help but overhear.
did you ever think Elena would have been better off if she'd never met you?
you're trying to get a rise out of me?
because my emotions are fine.
I love Elena. I despise you.
mm, so romantic.
so doomed to fail.
you know, as soon as she goes back to her old self, she'll go straight to Stefan.
that's the tragedy of you. You never get the girl.
she's gone. - What?
Elena's not in her cell. I'm gonna check the grounds.
find out what she did.
Oops. Did I forget to lock her in?
let's just say I've lost interest in Elena's recovery.
I'd rather watch her tear through an orphanage. Heh heh.
imagine trying to come back from a spiral like that.
Elena's gone? - What happened?
Donovan, you're coming with me.
why should he?
because Elena's hungry and missing.
for once, his life might actually have a purpose.
Bonnie, why aren't you answering?
Silas isn't going to just give up.
you're the only one that can stop him. Call me.
Caroline, what's going on?
mom, don't come any closer. Stop.
what's wrong?
I don't know how to tell if it's really you.
what if this is another trick?
well, he can get in my head.
and he would have known that I called you.
OK, Caroline. It's me.
it's your mother.
I don't know what's happening, but everything's going to be ok.
all right?
you just need to talk to me.
Hi. How's it going? - Oh, good.
please help me.
thank God you found me.
Elena, stop. I know you don't want to do this.
I know you don't want to hurt me. - I'm a vampire, Matt.
the thing about vampires is that we need to feed.
no, but you're more than that.
you're my friend. You're my oldest friend.
you're the girl that I've loved longer than I can remember.
whatever wall you want to put up,
I know that still means something to you.
deep down...
it probably does mean something...
but I am really hungry.
Bonnie hasn't called back yet.
I just don't understand why she hasn't called.
Caroline? There you are. What's going on?
are you all right?
I've been calling you for hours.
sorry. I came as soon as I got the message.
Caroline, let me in.
let me help.
how do I know it's you?
Silas keeps getting in my head, attacking me.
he says he wants to know where you are.
he threatened my mother.
mom, just stay there.
Caroline, that is not your mother.
what's going on?
Oh, my God.
did you really think you could hide from me, Bonnie?
I'm here now. What did you do to her mother?
she's right where you left her.
mom?
mom! Ohh...
I thought you and I were on the same side.
we are. The full moon isn't for two more days.
I've been gathering my strength, preparing myself.
you're the only one who can do this spell.
so I can't hurt you.
but I can hurt the people you love.
you do understand that, right?
I understand. I will do your spell.
I will drop the veil. And I will help you die.
I promise.
just don't hurt my friends.
come on. Please. Please, please, please.
mom...
your promise is binding, Bonnie.
if you break it, you have to answer to me.
I won't break it.
then you should leave this house right now.
and the next time I come looking for you,
I expect you to be waiting.
open... open your eyes, mom.
you need my blood in your system. Come on. Mom.
please, mom. Please...
Mom...Mom?
Oh, come on. I barely drained an artery.
come on. Get up. I'm hungry.
and my head's fuzzy. I can't think straight. I need more.
Elena, stop.
but you're so good.
Hey, hey. You're cut off.
let go of me.
stop it. - Enough.
you are acting like a little spoiled brat.
you know that?
you think that we can't punish you. Maybe not.
but I can sure punish him.
Seriously? You think this is... - Shut up.
I'm done playing nice.
turn your emotions back on right now, Elena, or so help me, God, I will give you something to be sad about.
I will kill him right here in front of you.
don't "Damon" me.
if she doesn't love anyone, fine.
prove it.
and if I'm wrong, what difference does it make?
one less bus boy.
you're bluffing.
how about now?
you feel anything now?
you angry I just turned your buddy into road kill?
or are you sad that the guy that everybody loves is just a bag of bones?
remember when he was a little kid, huh?
warm heart, big, goofy smile, his whole life ahead of him.
I guess it was a good idea that he was wearing this.
Oh, God, Matt.
you feeling that weight lifting off your chest?
that's joy.
because your friend isn't dead.
that's emotion, Elena. That's humanity.
you're gonna be ok.
no. - Look at me.
no. No. No. It's not ok. - Elena.
what I've done?
Hey. - No, no.
what did I do? I almost killed him.
Matt. I almost... and then Bonnie and Caroline. I just... no, no.
I mean, the woman, the waitress.
I actually killed that waitress.
Hey, hey. No! I killed... That waitress.
Hey. Elena. Hey. Hey.
look at me. Look at me. I know this stage, ok?
the emotions are overwhelming you. You just have to focus on one thing, ok?
no, I can't. I can't.
you just find that one thing inside of you that makes you strong.
it's in there. Just latch on to it.
channel everything you're feeling into that one emotion.
find the thing inside of you that makes you want to live.
Elena, let it in. Let it in.
that's good.
that's it. That's it.
just breathe it in. Blow everything else out.
that's good. That's good.
you ok?
no.
I'm not ok.
but I'll get better.
come on.
OK, this will work.
mom?
open your eyes. Come on.
wake up. You have to wake up.
you have to see me graduate.
I swear I'll get...
I swear I'll get you out of this town and find you a nice man.
mom!
OK.
I've never actually seen that ring in action before.
does it hurt?
you mean getting my neck snapped or coming back from the dead?
because they both hurt like hell.
did it work?
well, it looks like Elena's emotional floodgates have been burst wide open.
so she'll be back to her dull, sympathetic self in no time.
here.
that was a brave thing to do.
she saved me from drowning at the bottom of that river.
I'm just doing what I can to pay her back.
there aren't enough apologies in the world for the part that I played in this.
running you off the bridge,
Elena becoming a vampire to save you.
if you don't want me to cheat you into college, fine.
we'll do it the hard way. But, Matt...
I will spend every day until graduation trying to find a way to pay you back.
I'm perfectly aware that tombstone isn't just a hunk of rock.
no kidding. - And it got me thinking, all big spells require a source of power, a recurring element like a full moon, a comet.
but that tombstone is filled with the blood of your ancient relative Katsooyay or whatever.
she was powerful enough to create the other side.
so maybe if you have her blood, you don't need a full moon to drop the veil.
maybe you can do it whenever you want.
the thing I can't figure out is why do you want to drop the veil at all?
I have my reasons.
and again, I ask, what's in it for me?
you'll get the one thing you want most in this world...
freedom, survival.
never having to run from anyone again.
once I've dropped the veil, I can speak to Qetsiyah.
she created the spell that made Silas truly immortal, invulnerable to any weapon.
you'd like that for yourself, wouldn't you?
I can give it to you.
Bonnie Bennett, we have a deal.
there you go. How you feeling?
the pain's still there.
the grief... And shame.
I get it now.
shutting it off, it's a cheat.
I mean, you put up this wall and shut out everything that makes you who you are.
nothing affects you, nothing matters.
but things do matter... Things happen that can't be undone and now I know there's something I need to do about that.
Elena, what you need to do is rest, take it easy for a couple of days.
maybe even a couple of years. Here.
I... I'm done resting. I have to get ready.
there's so much that I have to do.
whoa. Hey.
what are you talking about?
think about it. It's so obvious.
go back far enough, there's one person who brought us to this...
who ruined our lives...
and look at you two.
everything that's happened to you, she did that.
she brought Klaus to Mystic Falls, she turned Caroline into a vampire.
she killed my brother.
it all comes down to her... Katherine.
OK, Stefan said to focus on one thing, so I did.
I focused on hate.
and I hate her so much.
well, I don't think that's what he meant.
Elena, Katherine's not worth your time.
even if you spend 10 minutes of your life hating her, she wins.
not if I kill her.
don't look so worried.
it's my job.
no, it's not. You're a housewife.
Yeah, punk?
you see my house around here?
a housewife.
they don't have a mother.
she might be somewhere else.
maybe she got eaten.
everything is food for something else.
could you be more obvious?
here, enjoy.
are you trying to buy my silence with fruit?
of course not. There's also jerky.
will you please tell me why your dad has a secret barn full of walkers?
it's creepy. - Shh.
you know that, right? - Shh.
just trust me on this, okay?
but I suck at lying.
I can't even play poker. It's too much like lying.
you have to keep this to yourself.
you have to. Please.
Dale, here's some peaches for you.
mm, thank you.
morning. - Morning.
what's up? - Nothing.
nothing's up. Why?
Hey.
this is not that great, but...
what, no pictures?
I'm so sorry. I feel like shit.
Yeah, you and me both.
I don't expect you to forgive me,
but if there's anything I can do...
you were trying to protect the group.
we're good.
but hey, shoot me again, and you'd best pray I'm dead.
what did Rick say?
you didn't tell him?
okay.
but you have to.
you're pregnant.
you need vitamins, medicine, a nice pillow.
here.
you can have my share.
honey, I don't want your food, okay?
eat.
you need to eat. You're too skinny.
and if you're not gonna let
Rick take care of you, then someone has to.
Lori, you have a medical condition.
I'll make another run into town.
just tell me what you need.
I need you to be quiet about this.
all right? Please.
Hey! Peach man.
the creek flows south, past that farmhouse Daryl found.
maybe Sophia dropped the doll there,
the current brought it downstream.
so what, you think she took this road here and then she went north?
Yeah. What's up that way?
a housing development.
it went in maybe 10 years ago.
take a run up there after gun practice.
I'll hold down the fort here, but take backup.
after what went down with daryl,
I don't want anyone going out alone.
we stay in pairs.
I'll take suggestions on a partner.
see how they do on the range, then take your pick.
Thanks.
my binoculars.
yeah yeah.
okay, bye.
we'd like to join you for gun training today.
Hershel's been very clear.
I can't involve any of you in what we do without his okay.
he doesn't like it, but he consented.
Otis was the only one who knew guns.
now that he's gone, we gotta learn to protect ourselves.
her father saw the sense in that.
no offense, but I'll ask Hershel myself.
dude, nice lid, man.
what's going on?
I want to learn to shoot too.
can you teach me?
well, man, that's-- that's up to your parents.
can you talk to them? They'll listen to you.
we'll see, okay?
Hey.
let me see what you've got there.
how the hell did this happen?
well, it's my fault. I let him into the R. V.
he said he wanted a walkie, that you sent him for one.
so on top of everything else, he lied.
what's he thinking?
he wants to learn how to shoot. He asked me to teach him.
now it's none of my business,
but I'm happy to do it. It's your call.
I'm not comfortable with it.
Oh, don't make me out to be the unreasonable one here. Rick?
I know. I have my concerns too, but
there's no but. He was just shot.
he's just back on his feet and he wants a gun?
better than him being afraid of 'em.
there are guns in camp for a reason.
he should learn to handle them safely.
I don't want my kid walking around with a gun.
but how can you defend that?
you can't let him go around without protection.
he's as safe as he'll ever be right here.
look, everything you're saying makes perfect sense. It feels wrong.
I mean I didn't feel good about him following you out into the woods.
and I wish I'd said something.
I should've gone with my gut.
he's growing up, thank god.
we've got to start treating him more like an adult.
then he needs to act like one.
he's not mature enough to handle a gun.
I'm not gonna play with it, mom.
it's not a toy.
I'm sorry I disappointed you, but I want to look for Sophia and I want to defend our camp.
I can't do that without a gun.
Shane's the best instructor I know.
I've seen him teach kids younger than Carl.
you will take this seriously and you will behave responsibly.
and if I hear from anyone in this camp that you're not living up to our expectations
he won't let you down.
Yeah.
now if you're gonna do this, you listen to Shane.
okay, dad. - All right? You be careful.
you coming? - I gotta help Dale clean the spark plugs on the R. V.
he said he's gonna teach me mechanics.
I should probably go look for him.
you found me.
he's a good learner.
spark plugs, huh?
want to tell me what's going on?
you're old.
you're-- you know things.
so.
what if somebody told you something that somebody else should know--?
Glenn, stop being dramatic. Spit it out.
there's-- there's walkers in the barn and Lori's pregnant.
Hey, come on, man. Don't give me that gangsta shit.
good work.
don't be discouraged.
you'll hit the target eventually.
who says I didn't hit my target?
try this one. It's heavy.
you get better balance, twice the rounds.
I'd say she's got the hang of it.
I'd say she's ready for the advanced class.
it might be worth your while after the rest of us head back to camp.
sure. Why not?
how's it feeling? - I like the weight.
so you decided not to leave us.
something change your mind?
got it. - That's a great shot.
nervous Nelly?
she find her way home?
found her in her stall this morning.
I love your fields.
took a long walk this morning.
I ended up by the barn.
I heard the moans.
that's unfortunate.
I'm sure you have your reasons for keeping this a secret.
I saw the broadcasts before they stopped, saw the irrational fear, the atrocities, like the incident at my well.
we put down a walker.
you killed a person.
well, if you watched the same broadcasts I did,
you saw walkers attack, kill. They're dangerous.
a paranoid schizophrenic is dangerous too.
we don't shoot sick people.
with all due respect, you are cut off from the outside world here.
but I've seen people that I cared about die and come back, and they're not people.
my wife and stepson are in that barn.
they're people.
I'm sorry.
let me help.
I'll speak to Rick. He's a good man.
we can make the barn more secure, keep everybody safe.
the barn is secure.
keep this to yourself if you want to help.
Rick is a man of conscience, but are you so sure about everyone in your group?
afternoon.
I take it your boy did well.
not bad, actually.
be grateful you don't have a daughter.
if only things were as simple as wanting to shoot.
Carl's getting that chance, thanks to you.
and I'm eternally grateful for what you did and your hospitality.
we'll earn our keep.
I appreciate that, but with Carl getting better,
I imagine you'll be moving on soon
fort Benning, I hear.
still a virgin. - The target's too small.
come on, that's crap. Half-hour ago
I saw you nail a bull's-eye at 25'.
it wasn't moving.
you think a walker's gonna hold still for you?
focus and reload, go again.
Uh-oh, did I piss you off?
come on, girl, you've got walkers all around you.
they're the woods. They're in the R. V.
you're gonna need more than a damn screwdriver.
stop badgering me. - You're too damn emotional.
you need to shut it down. Take all that guilt, take that fear, that being pissed off, take it out.
right, 'cause you're so calm.
see that? See, I can be pissed off.
I could be whistling "Dixie" and I'll always hit the target.
but you, god, you shoot like a damn girl.
you stand here and you point your weapon.
point like you point your finger. Do not think about it.
I'm talking about muscle memory, girl
muscle memory.
now go on, shoot that son of a bitch.
he's coming for you! He's 10 feet away!
he's 9 feet-- he's 5 feet away!
right there, that's the walker that got Amy.
now you shoot that son of a bitch! Shoot him!
Hershel expects us to leave?
does anybody else know?
not yet.
were you gonna tell me? - Of course.
when? How long have you known?
not long. You don't need to worry about this.
how can you expect me not to worry? We have shelter here and food and water and medical care.
I've been talking with Hershel. It's not carved in stone.
he thinks it is.
we have to fix this.
people are settling in here. They'll be devastated.
I know. I'm working on it.
maybe I can talk to him too and plead our case.
no, things are uneasy. The best thing right now is to give Hershel some space.
don't look at me like that.
like what?
like you're scared. Like you don't trust me.
I can take it from everyone else, but not from you.
I don't understand how you could keep something like this from me.
Carl's barely on his feet. And Sophia's missing.
and Daryl and T-dog are hurt. How can we leave?
it's not what I want either, but if we have to go,
I'll do whatever it takes to make sure
you and carl are okay.
we'll get by. We will.
okay.
come on, let me give you a lift.
my feet work just fine.
look, I'm just trying to get you rattled,
give you an idea
what it's like when the shits starts to fly.
is that an apology?
I crossed the line when I brought amy into it.
Yeah, it's an apology.
you're a real dick sometimes.
Yeah, I acknowledge that. I'll tell you what:
I've got a lead on sophia. I'm gonna go check it out.
why don't you come with me, be my backup?
my wife was pregnant once.
she miscarried
and we didn't try again after that.
I'm so sorry.
the thing that I remember most
is how nauseated she became
at the smell of cooking meat.
and she was a meat-eating gal-- my wife,
but with the pregnancy
that thanksgiving,
the turkey
she couldn't be in the house
for two days until it was aired out,
poor thing.
glenn told you?
what did you expect? The boy has no guile.
I haven't told Rick.
I can't.
because of Shane?
was it that obvious?
no no, I don't think anyone knew.
I didn't, not for sure.
look, I thought my husband was dead.
and I felt like I died with him.
and I
I wanted to feel something-- anything.
and now I hate myself for it.
and the baby?
it's Rick's.
none of the rest of it matters.
then what's your concern?
memories are what keep me going now.
memories of what life used to be.
and I
I've got a deep well to draw on.
I still remember joy.
but I think carl's well is already running dry.
and this baby
the baby won't have any good memories at all,
only fear and pain.
you can't think like that.
we can still find joy
and we can still take strength from each other.
do you really think this baby has a chance,
that it could grow up and live a happy life?
look me in the eye and tell me
that my baby will grow up to be your age
and die happy.
tell me. Tell me you believe that.
I'm sorry. I'm-- it just came out. And it was dale.
it's okay. I never should have put you in that position.
I've been thinking about what you said
about needing help.
and you're right that I do.
name it. Yeah.
if you're still willing to make a run into town for me...
I'm your man.
thank you.
it's okay. It's not a big deal really.
you didn't have to come.
you could hate me from a distance.
please say something.
Maggie, I-- - I asked for your trust and you betrayed it.
now my dad's pissed at me.
your turn.
so your dad thinks they're sick?
you agree with that?
even after what you saw at the well?
I'm not sure what I saw at the well.
Yes, you are.
look, if you'd seen Atlanta,
you would not have a barn full of walkers.
I wish you'd stop calling them that.
what do you call them?
mom,
Shawn,
Mr. And mrs. Fischer, Lacey, Duncan.
what does she want now?
I can't say.
so when one of them asks you to keep your mouth shut...
crawl out of my butt
and help me look, please.
you've got to be kidding me.
No!
No! No!
Glenn!
Maggie! - Glenn, help me!
help! Glenn!
get it off me! Help!
did it get you? Did it bite you?
Glenn.
we're gonna have to go house to house.
we'll start at the far end and we'll work our way back.
if Sophia got this far, she has a real shot,
don't you think?
Hey! We got your stuff.
Maggie, hang on, please.
come on in here.
Why? Nothing to hide. We got your special delivery right here.
we got your lotion, got your conditioner, - Your soap opera digest. - Maggie.
next time you want something, get it your damn self.
we're not your errand boys. - Honey, I
and here's your abortion pills.
that was not cool. - Which part?
the part where that bitch almost got us killed?
I should've gone alone.
if you want to blame anybody, blame me.
right, take the blame.
you know, for a smart guy, you're really stupid.
okay, I'm confused,
because I think you just paid me a compliment, but you made it s
I've already lost three of the people
that I care about most in this world.
Maggie-- - shut up.
you're smart. You're brave.
you're a leader. But you don't know it.
and your friends don't want to know it.
they'd rather have you fetching peaches.
there's a dead guy in the well? Send glenn down.
you're walker bait.
I can't take you becoming one of them.
Sophia?
anyone?
Sophia?
they walled off the hallway?
they tried to make a stand here.
Sophia?
she was never here,
was she?
I don't know how to tell Carol this was another dead end.
come on, let's move.
cover that street. I'll clear the car.
Oh shit.
focus now. Clear the jam. Focus.
are you kidding me? - I got your back. Go.
Andrea, Andrea, let's go.
come on.
Andrea, come on.
the blood on Maggie's shirt
she was attacked.
are you guys all right? How bad was it?
it was pretty close.
I'm so sorry.
I should never have asked you to go.
I offered.
I thought the town was safe, but if you hadn't come back
but we did. I always do.
the morning-after pills-- will they even work?
I don't know.
and I don't know if I want them to.
then I got these too,
just in case.
prenatal vitamins.
that's a hell of a choice.
I'm glad it's not mine.
Lori, we're friends, aren't we?
with everything we've been through-- yeah.
I can't tell you what to do.
I could never tell you something like that.
but your choice
maybe you shouldn't make it alone.
come on then.
get over here. Get over here.
anything?
not today.
I'm so sorry.
we'll cover more ground tomorrow.
what happened out there?
um, I
the place was overrun. - Yeah.
let's go get you cleaned up.
Shane, shane,
I was thinking, you've got that nice new ride of yours, plenty of fuel, more than enough for you to get far from here.
what, you telling me to leave?
I know you've been planning to.
maybe now is a good time.
is this about Andrea?
I'm looking out for the group.
you think the group would be better off without me, Dale?
why don't you tell that to Rick or Lori?
their boy would be dead if I hadn't put my ass on the line.
and Otis's.
you've been vague about that night, about what happened.
Otis died a hero.
so you've said.
a little boy lived because of what went down that night.
I think you ought to show some gratitude.
I wasn't there. - No, man, you weren't.
but I was the time that you raised your gun on Rick.
come on. Jesus. - You had him in your sights
and you held him there.
I know what kind of man you are.
you think I'd shoot Rick?
that is my best friend.
that's the man that I love.
I love him like he's my a brother.
you think that's the kind of man I am?
that's right.
well, maybe we ought to just think that through.
say I'm the kind of man
who'd gun down his own best friend.
what do you think I'd do to some guy that I don't even like when he starts throwing accusations my way?
what do you think?
is there something you need to tell me?
we can't leave. I'm pregnant.
are you?
I threw them up.
you can yell if you want.
you can scream if you have to, but...
talk to me.
how long have you known?
does it matter?
days? Weeks? And you didn't tell me?
I'm telling you now. - No.
I found these.
so glenn knows, right?
instead of going to me, you sent him to get pills?
I panicked. You tell me we have no roof and no walls
do not put this on me!
you tear into me for keeping secrets when you're holding onto this?
you want me to bring a baby into this?
to live a short, cruel life?
how can you think like that?
we can't even protect the son we already have.
so this is the solution?
Rick, I threw them up.
I screwed up.
I don't know how we do this.
we can make it work.
how? Tell me how.
we'll figure it out.
shouldn't we try to figure it out?
you threw up the pills.
you want this baby. I know you do.
not like this.
not giving birth in a ditch.
not when its life will hang by a thread from the second it's born.
not when every cry will put it, and Carl, and everyone we care about, in danger.
that's not right.
not even giving it a chance isn't right either.
maybe this is why I didn't want to tell you.
I still-- I still don't understand why.
you really think I'd make you have a baby you don't want?
no, so that if I went through with it, it would be on my conscience and not yours.
maybe that's true, but
I can't live like this anymore,
Lori.
we can't live like this.
is there anything else i should know about?
Shane and I.
I know. Of course I know.
you thought I was dead.
the world went to shit and you thought I was dead.
right?
Yeah.
Hey!
I need your help on Election Day, all right?
Hey, thank you.
Hey, I need your help on Election Day.
senator.
senator Vinick has always been opposed to gay marriage.
always opposed?
still sore?
it feels like it's going to fall off.
only five thousand more handshakes until the election.
how could I always be opposed to something I never heard about until a few years ago?
she is not helping.
she stabilized our numbers.
keeping us locked in a tie with two weeks left to go is what I call not helping. - She stopped the slippage in the South.
she's scaring away independents.
we lost independents because a nuclear power plant almost had a meltdown after I said nuclear power was completely safe.
that is water under the bridge.
now we've got to... - If it's water under the bridge, how come I'm still ducking reporters on the campaign trail?
our next event: Small Business Association of Chicago.
and we've got to get out of there fast because Santos is scheduled to speak right after us.
that's happening a lot lately.
this is the way it always happens the last couple of weeks in swing states.
Chicago would like be a lot better if I'd stayed in Florida and let the Santos motorcade create all the traffic jams.
we don't have any time for questions. We're already behind schedule.
let's give a big Chicago welcome to the Republican candidate for President of the United States, Senator Arnold Vinick!
can you bend all the fingers?
Yeah, a little bit.
try to extend the fingers straight out.
No!
does it hurt when you do that?
no. It doesn't hurt me when I do that.
it kills me when I do that.
we really need a set of X-rays.
No!
no, no, no. Doctor, we've got a bus-load of reporters following us.
we stop for an X-ray the headline's going to read "Handshake breaks Vinick's hand."
I can't say for sure without an X-ray, but I think you've got a metacarpal fracture and you're going to need a cast.
no cast.
senator, you have to... - I can't look like an old man falling apart on the campaign trail.
he's got a crowd waiting for him in Pittsburg, right now.
I guess I can realign the bone and give him a cast that he can take off when he's in public.
welcome to politics, doctor.
if anyone asks you what you were doing in the car with me, we were discussing health care policy.
well actually, I do have some suggestions about Medicare.
and now it's my honor to introduce the Democratic Candidate for President of the United States, Congressman Matthew Santos!
Hey, Chicago.
we can't leave him in Ohio for two days.
we've got a full day in Cleveland tomorrow, plus promises to keep in Columbus and Dayton.
I want him out of Ohio by midnight tomorrow, and on the set of "Good Morning, Miami," at 7 am.
Yeah.
guest lists for the Cleveland event.
Yeah. Right there.
here?
uh, no. On top of the other pile.
then after a full day in Florida...
someone named "Bob" for you?
twice in one week.
what are your latest numbers in California?
are you working for this campaign now?
you should have new numbers by now. Check, will you?
do we have the new California numbers?
Yeah. We just got them.
we're up by two, but that includes all the leaners.
so, basically, we're tied.
you've got to get Santos out there right now.
Yeah, we've got him in Illinois and Pennsylvania today,
ohio tomorrow, Florida the next day.
california's the whole ball game. So...
Yeah, we're pushing up the media buy in California but we've got to keep the candidate working in the states where he can shake enough hands to make a difference.
Yeah, but California... - Retail politics doesn't work in California.
the place is too big. - I'm not talking about retail politics.
TV is the only way to reach those voters.
exactly. That's why I'm... - ...media buy in...
Josh! - ...in Ohio and...
Josh, Josh, Josh! Listen to me.
you're getting three hours of sleep a night, you've got 300 urgent calls to return;
you're not thinking straight in that place.
now take a deep breath and listen to me for one second!
okay, I'm listening.
you can win this thing if you get him out to California right now.
I thought you were going to stay at headquarters.
I got tired of being ignored.
Annie, have you got that thing the doctor gave me?
uh, yeah.
you know, while you're out there shaking your hand off,
Matt Santos is running his new game plan and it's working.
criss-crossing the swing states, talking nothing but energy policy.
he throws in a line about the nuclear accident to keep pressure...
we're going to have Pittsburg all to ourselves this afternoon, but we're going to cross paths with Santos tonight in Philadelphia.
he's speaking at the Constitution Center just before us.
tell Advance no rope lines in Pittsburg or Philly.
okay.
tell them no one gets to shake the Senator's hand.
not the police chief, not the mayor...
how are they supposed to enforce that?
tell Advance to figure it out.
two weeks out, we've lost our lead.
we?
you. You have lost your lead and we still don't have a strategy to get it back.
I thought the gay marriage nonsense was the new strategy.
you're opposed to gay marriage.
there's nothing wrong with letting your values voters know that.
the federal government has nothing to do with marriage law. Nothing.
no one should care what I think of gay marriage.
and no one should care how tall you are and what kind of hair you have, - but you know they do, so let's... - I'm not going to win this thing on gay marriage.
you don't know that.
gay marriage is a state issue. It's not a federal...
spare me the political science lecture.
Bruno's 50-state strategy was ridiculous even before the accident.
republicans have won 49 states twice in the last 100 years.
Yeah, I've heard you say that 1000 times on TV.
so you think nothing's changed in the last 20 years in the Republican Party?
Yeah. People like you have taken over.
people like me think a win's a win.
51% is plenty for us.
people like you want to get into the campaign hall of fame.
no one is talking about a 50-state strategy anymore, not since the nuclear thing, okay?
if you hadn't wasted the last five months trying to win Massachusetts, - we wouldn't be behind in the South. - Okay.
we had every Southern state before the nuclear accident.
Yeah, but you didn't have any goodwill there.
you were the lesser of two evils.
if they'd actually liked you, they wouldn't have abandoned you so fast.
they haven't abandoned us.
they've moved us into the Undecided column.
no one outside of Texas has moved from us to Santos.
Oh, well, Texas only has 34 Electoral Votes, so why worry about that.
you think we're not worried?
we were never counting on winning Santos' home state. Latino registration...
are you counting on winning Vinick's home state?
we'll bounce back in California.
when?
we're okay in California.
we're only two points behind Santos.
and that's after a nuclear accident that scared half the state...
nothing is okay in California. The nuclear accident cost you that state.
you don't have the time or the money to win it back.
I can't win back California by going to the right.
for every voter you win me in Alabama, I lose two in California.
that's why we should be back in the South this week, especially Florida.
we followed your advice. We spent all last week in the South.
where did it get us?
it stopped the bleeding.
and if you were still in the South right now talking tax cuts, strong on national defense, tough on crime in front of flag-waving crowds,
I wouldn't have to be on TV trying to talk to the Republican Base and I could shut up about gay marriage.
I'm saying we stay in the South until we get a solid lead.
then we spend a week, maybe ten days, closing the deal in Missouri, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
you don't have to say anything to Alabama voters to lose you California voters.
but Senator, you have got to energize the base of the party if we're going to get the turn-out we need to get 51% on Election Day.
senator, you can't pretend...
Yeah.
can I come in?
just you.
does your hand feel better in that thing?
they say replacing Sheila was a sign of weakness.
inside baseball: no one cares except the press.
I shouldn't have let Sheila quit.
she said it would send a message, give the campaign a fresh start.
Sheila was right.
we should have just put Jane out there in front of the cameras and let her energize the base and then ignore her.
we are ignoring her.
the press is doing Santos' work for him.
Santos could take a vacation, just let the press keep hammering me on this nuclear thing and he wins.
the President sends troops into Kazakhstan and that's still not enough to get this nuclear power quote out of the news.
when is old news going to be old news?
you know what I really hate about Jane?
she's not always wrong.
we need a new strategy for the last two weeks.
so, what do you got?
I wish I could tell you I have a better idea than Jane.
California?
Yeah.
I thought you said we weren't going to California because it was too big for us.
Yeah, that was then.
Yeah, that was yesterday.
right. Then I rethought the whole thing.
you rethought it?
Yeah, you know, I talked it over.
with who?
usual suspects, party people, experience campaign types, and we agree that because California media is way more expensive than Ohio...
excuse me, I'm sorry. Can we have the room, please?
it's going to be a lot cheaper for us to campaign in California and buy TV time in Ohio and Florida.
you'll get five minutes for free on every local station all over California instead of spending big bucks on one 30-second commercial.
if we can push up a few more points in California, get your lead outside the margin, the press is going to explode with stories about Vinick losing his home state.
it's going to build momentum for us everywhere else.
Yeah, knock Vinick off his game.
he's off his game!
now we've got to knock him out of the game.
california's the key.
you get a real lead there,
Vinick's going to have to give up on his home state, bet everything on a Southern strategy.
now, he didn't play well in the South when he was riding high.
he's sure as hell not going to play any better now that he's desperate.
okay, get me there tonight.
but I want a full schedule of California events tomorrow from breakfast to lights out.
it'll be full.
when do I go on?
they're going to start you're intro in a couple of minutes.
tell them I'm not going on until he's out of the building.
I came to Philadelphia to talk to the people of Pennsylvania about what we should be doing for the next four years, about energy policy, about education.
I want to hear what he has to say. - ... about job security, about pension security.
I don't want to get into a whole political blame game about what happened at the San Andreo nuclear power plant.
sure you don't.
it was an accident.
it was exactly the kind of accident that I foresaw when I opposed the building of nuclear power plants in the state of Texas.
the governor of California and the President responded to the problem immediately and they contained it.
he'll side-step that one.
we're not going to figure out how to run this campaign by watching the Santos campaign.
this is the time you ignore the other guy and sprint to the finish line.
you keep pushing your tax cut message...
the press won't let me.
they're not going to let up on this nuclear accident.
forget about the press.
that's not how I got this far.
I don't duck the tough questions.
I say what I think.
that's how I get elected.
look, senator, I love the straight-talk thing, but it doesn't work in every situation.
that isn't me out there campaigning now. That's the problem.
we're going to get past the nuclear accident.
no, we're not, not unless we deal with it.
if we open the whole nuclear-power can of worms...
it's already open - wide open. I've got to close it.
I've got to start answering their questions.
there is no one in this campaign - no one in this party
that thinks you should be talking about nuclear power now.
we insert a new energy paragraph in the stump speech;
something about safe energy sources - you wouldn't have to mention nuclear.
that's not going to work. - What are you going to do?
go out there and say you were wrong about nuclear power?
No! I still think we need nuclear power.
this is the worst possible time to say that.
I should to a "Til They Drop" press conference on the nuclear accident.
it's a big mistake.
explain my role in getting the plant built.
talk about where we go from here on nuclear power.
answer every reporter's question.
stay at the microphone until I bore them to death.
that'll look desperate.
worked for Andrews in the Senate race when he had that problem with is tax returns.
we're going to California tomorrow.
I'm going to do a press conference in front of the San Andreo nuclear power plant.
okay. My work's done here.
what, you're quitting?
it's been fun. Good luck.
whoa, whoa. Jane, hold on, please.
I can't afford to get blamed for the mistakes this campaign is making.
and we can't afford to have another story about trouble with the Vinick campaign staff.
it would look like we're completely out of control.
I don't want you to quit.
I have a reputation to protect.
quitter?
better than loser.
then don't lose.
the press conference is a mistake.
campaigning in your home state is a mistake.
I let them ask me every nuclear question they can think of.
we get one more round of stories on this and then it's behind us.
it's a sign of weakness.
if I win the election you're going to get all the credit.
you came on to a sinking ship and you saved the day.
if you lose?
then you came onto a sinking ship and it sank.
it's not your fault.
how about we go with my strategy tomorrow, and then we go with your strategy for the rest of the campaign.
and if you disagree with my strategy?
then we'll fight about it.
and we'll end up doing it your way.
you'll win some and you'll lose some.
they're ready for you on stage.
the party is going to flood California with surrogate speakers after your day of free media.
good.
your speech for San Francisco.
can I get my briefcase?
it's not in here?
uh, no.
okay, I'll get it.
the Congressman needs his briefcase.
I thought you had it.
no, I had it in Chicago. You had it in Philadelphia.
no, I had it in Pittsburg and then I put it back in his cabin for the flight to Philly.
well, it's not there now.
did we take it to the event in California?
I don't know. I had my arms full of stuff.
I don't remember the briefcase in Philadelphia.
did you notice the Congressman's briefcase in Philadelphia?
no, but the candidate wasn't carrying anything.
does he need it right now?
he asked for it. That means "right now" to me.
we can't tell him we lost it.
well, you were the last one who had it.
he asked you for it.
tell him we're searching every compartment.
worst-case scenario: it somehow got slipped into checked baggage, we'll have it to him by the time we get to the hotel.
get the L. A. schedule to the press right away so they can schedule news satellite trucks to cover us live.
you get my briefcase?
not exactly.
I thought Otto had it, he thought it was in here.
we're searching under the seats and in the overheads right now.
you lost my briefcase?
Worst-case: it got slipped into checked baggage.
we'll have it for you by the time you get back to your room.
call Philadelphia an retrace our steps.
check the cars we used and check the rooms that we were in.
I left my wallet in that thing.
I hope you don't have any super-secret strategy memos in that briefcase.
we have super-secret strategy memos?
I wish we did.
did you schedule this trip because Santos is starting to pull ahead in California?
that's not what our polls show.
msnbc, right now.
did you change your schedule after the Santos campaign decided to go to California tomorrow?
we didn't know about the Santos trip when Senator Vinick decided to go to California.
she's a terrible liar, isn't she?
team Vinick is in a panic.
senator Vinick is still ahead in the Southern states, and he's confident that his home state of California is going to support him as it always has in his Senate campaigns.
they're trying to steal our free media.
get the local TV cameras to abandon Santos and cover Vinick.
it won't work if you spin it as Vinick trying to chase Santos out of California.
then every Vinick story becomes a story about the Santos surge in California?
that's right.
I need Lou on the plane.
thank you.
yeah?
Hey, it looks like Vinick is going to follow you out to California tomorrow.
how desperate is that?
they're trying to steal our free media coverage out there.
you have to spin it that Vinick is chasing Santos.
turn every Vinick story into a Santos story.
okay, I'll start working the press cabin now.
Hey, Josh?
yeah?
the Congressman's briefcase: what's inside there?
road stuff, toothbrush, electric razor, sometimes a wallet. Why?
we seem to have lost it and he seems kind of worried.
they guy's running a tie for the Presidency and he's got two weeks left.
you can expect him to look worried once in a while.
so, there's nothing bad in there.
like?
I don't know: heroin, porn?
no, that's all mine.
I'm going to go now.
San Andreo press conference is set for 12 noon.
news networks are going to cover it live.
you've got two choices for the evening event: San Diego and L. A.
the problem with the L. A. thing is that Santos is going to be there.
I thought he was going to be in Florida tomorrow.
he put out a press advisory about a half hour ago.
they're going to do a California swing tomorrow:
San Francisco, San Jose, Fresno and L. A.
he thinks he can take my state away from me in a day.
the mayor's going to introduce Santos and the L. A. event, so San Diego probably.
no. L. A.
I want to get in his face.
I want Santos to see if he's going to take California, he's going to have to rip it out of my hands.
the story's going to be Vinick chases Santos to California.
if he skips Florida tomorrow, then that's where we should be.
we already announced the trip. We can't change our public schedule again.
no, but we can get out of California as quick as we can.
no.
we could have Florida all to ourselves. We could...
if Santos takes California, game over.
a Republican can win the Presidency without California.
and a Democrat can't.
this isn't some sentimental, home-state thing.
this is about winning.
I don't have a 50-state strategy anymore.
I have a one-state strategy: the one state that has everything.
big cities, small towns, mountains, deserts, farms, factories, fishermen, surfers, all races, all religions, gay, straight
everything this country has.
there's more real America in California than anywhere else.
if I can win California, I can win the Country.
that's a nice speech, just don't say it into any microphones because everyone else in the 49 other states thinks California is a giant psycho ward.
california hasn't been competitive in a Presidential race in 25 years.
they don't know how to campaign there. I do.
all right, let's just get out there and see how it goes.
okay. Just please, forget about the power plant.
go home to Santa Paola.
remind the country, especially the South, of your hometown roots in a farming community.
I can't go to California without dealing with the nuclear accident.
take questions about the nuclear thing but in your hometown, surrounded by friends where you'll actually get some applause instead of standing in front of a radioactive danger zone where property values have just collapsed and everyone's ready to vote for anyone but Vinick.
I've got to be there to show them that I believe we've contained the leak, that it's safe, that the clean-up is working.
standing in front of the power plant says the accident was my fault. Blame me.
we'll talk about Florida tomorrow night.
if you're right, then they'll be chasing me out of California by then.
Annie, I want an updated briefing book on the nuclear clean-up, tomorrow morning on the plane.
okay.
is your hand any better?
do I sound crazy to you?
it's been a tough couple of weeks.
tough? I've been in tough campaigns before.
this is way beyond tough. This is a nightmare.
that nuclear power plant works perfectly for 24 years.
the race was going to tighten by now, even without that accident.
it wasn't going to get this tight.
we were heading for at least a five-point win and
california was going to give us a big Electoral College win.
we had this thing locked.
we still do.
now you're starting to sound crazy.
that isn't mine.
I know. It belongs to Matt Santos.
Yeah, very funny.
I'm not kidding.
I don't know this joke. What am I supposed to say now?
it's not a joke.
that's Matt Santos' briefcase.
Yeah.
and how did you get it? You win it in a raffle?
I was the last one out of the holding room tonight.
I saw it, I thought it was one of ours. There was no name on it. I opened it up...
that's really Matt Santos' briefcase?
Yeah.
I don't want to know any more about this.
I want to be able to say I had nothing to do with this.
I didn't know anything about it.
you stole Matt Santos' briefcase?
I didn't steal it; I found it.
but you didn't give it back.
you could have gotten it back to him easily.
you could have given it to the Secret Service.
I didn't think of that.
Yes, you did.
and you would have done it in a second unless you found something in there, something that would hurt Santos.
you just told me you didn't want to know anymore about it.
who else knows about this?
no one.
it could make you President.
I need to talk to a lawyer. I need to think this through.
as soon as that information comes out - the Santos campaign: it's over.
so, you do not have to go to California tomorrow and do that painful press conference which is going to play as if that nuclear accident was somehow your fault.
and you do not have to draw any more attention to the fact that your polls aren't looking so good right now.
and you can keep campaigning in the South and Midwest
look like you're driving your own train instead of jumping on Santos' train.
that briefcase can kill us.
it's got a sort of a journal in there.
I said don't tell me.
it's a day-planner.
it has notes about meetings, people, lots of stuff that can be embarrassing
what he really thinks about the Vice President, how bad a campaigner Leo McGarry is.
and he also has a checkbook in there.
it's a strange one. It just says "M. Santos."
it's not a joint account with the wife, there's no address on the checks.
he just uses it for ATM withdrawals and one check each month, same amount, made out to someone named Anita Morales.
there is an Anita Morales - 29 years old, never married, one child, seven-year old girl
she's a clerk in Houston, City Hall, hired nine years ago by Mayor Matt Santos.
come on, we've all heard the rumors about Matt Santos.
there are rumors about all of us.
do you have a checkbook like that?
child support payments for a kid nobody knows about?
hush money for an affair?
you have to give back that briefcase.
if this comes out he's going to have to take a DNA test.
he's going to have to prove that he did not have an affair, or a child, with a woman he's been making monthly payments to for who knows how long.
we can't do this.
I can't do it.
I work for you.
I am not going to do anything you do not want me to do.
give this thing to the Secret Service right now. And tell them...
I don't know you tell them but you just give it to them.
just think about what other secrets this guy might have.
this may be the tip of the iceberg about what we don't know about him.
look: how about I keep the briefcase, we sleep on it, and we'll talk about it tomorrow.
just tell me what you want me to do, Senator.
keep it.
Oh, yeah, we had a huge crowd in San Francisco this morning.
the Silicon Valley event was bigger than we anticipated.
right now, Fresno's going nuts for him. California loves our guy.
the news networks aren't giving you any live coverage yet.
you got enough cameras out there?
Yeah, we've got all the local TV stations.
we are going to rule the 6 o'clock news all over the state.
still no word on the briefcase?
it wasn't in the checked baggage.
did you tell the Congressman yet?
I'm gonna wait until he asks.
that's very brave.
Hey, if he's not worried about it, why remind him?
in a surprise move, the Vinick campaign followed the Santos campaign to California today and we're going to go to live coverage from our sister station, KRAC, in San Andreo, where Senator Arnold Vinick...
call me from L. A.
Hey, Bram's on line two. He says it's urgent.
hang on, Lou.
Yeah, Bram.
they cut to Vinick?
Lou, Fresno TV is going live with Vinick. Get Santos onto the stage right now.
tell the Fresno camera crews they have to stay live with the guy who actually came to Fresno.
good afternoon.
I just finished a complete inspection tour of the facility, - and I'm here to report to the people of California... - Maybe not.
... that the clean-up is ahead of schedule, and the radiation levels in and around the plant are back to normal...
do you think it's safe to live near this plant?
Yes, I do.
I just spent two hours inside the plant, so I'm convinced it's safe.
completely safe?
obviously, I never should have said that nuclear power is completely safe.
I said that, in the heat of a debate, nothing is completely safe.
we're never going to figure out how to make driving a car completely safe, but Californians are still going to do it every day.
living near a nuclear power plant is a lot safer than driving a car.
the top priority in every nuclear power plant has to be safety.
this is one area where I think we need more federal regulation and more strictly enforced safety standards.
are you blaming the Bartlet Administration for failing to...?
I'm not blaming anyone.
president Bartlet did everything he could within current law to maintain safety at these plants.
when I'm President, I'm going to strengthen those safety regulations.
that wasn't your position when this plant was being built.
you wrote several letters to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, urging them to expedite the approval of this plant.
Yes, I did.
and in one of those letters, you complained the project was being delayed because of what you called "burdensome regulations."
I was very eager to make sure that California had an adequate supply of low-cost electricity.
you know the governor and most of the states Congressional Delegation supported the building of the plant.
but no one pushed harder than you did, Senator.
I don't do anything half-heartedly.
so you no longer think regulation of nuclear power plants is burdensome?
no.
do you regret saying it was?
I wouldn't write that letter today.
do you regret it?
that was 25 years ago. We've all learned a lot since then.
do you regret writing the letter, Senator?
Yes. Next question.
what the hell is he doing?
trying to get it behind him.
if he does a "till-they-drop" press conference, it just might work.
if he does a "Don't worry, be happy" routine, he's going to look nuts.
you're not going to get that lucky.
he's starting to sound like the straight-talking Arnie again.
if this works...
it worked for Andrews in the Senate race. He got the tax thing behind him.
and he's killing your free media day in California.
Yeah, whose bright idea was that? I forget.
Vinick's got to wrap this thing up.
how long has he been on?
over an hour doesn't look like he'll be quitting anytime soon.
Yeah, he's cutting into our press coverage. Look at that.
Yeah, we'll do it now.
Josh wants us to go back inside, set up a quick press conference, see if we can get some cameras turned on you.
dueling press conferences? No.
Hey, I'd love to tell you I had a better idea.
Fresno! I love you guys.
thanks for coming out.
come on inside.
we're going to talk some more.
but no one's saying we should get rid of all those gas stations.
I think the American people understand...
two hours and 48 minutes.
he's just getting warmed up.
why didn't you fight him on this? You know this is a bad idea.
I think he may have a better feel for California politics than we do.
are you drinking the Vinick kool-aid this morning?
if he goes on much longer he's going to turn this into a mini-series.
the people who are most worried about Global Warming...
there's no way we're going to be able to spin this.
...are the same people who are most opposed to the use of nuclear power.
over a 26-year career in public service,
I'd probably do a lot of things differently if I could do them over again.
but my job is to make the best decision I can with the information I have at the time.
you know, if you do something for 26 years you should keep getting better at it.
I'm better than I used to be because I have better information.
I have more experience making tough decisions.
and I have more mature judgment.
and that's what I think this country needs now, more than ever.
we have troops on the ground in Kazakhstan and more on the way.
that's the choice that President Bartlet made to try and keep Russia and China from slipping into war there.
now, the next President is going to have to take over that situation the first hour on the job.
that's the most important issue that's facing the country in this campaign.
not who said what about nuclear power 25 years ago.
or did one of us use too strong a word in a debate.
the real decision American people are going to have to make is who do they want as their next Commander-In-Chief.
all right, next question.
anyone?
Nope.
thank you. Thank you very much.
damn, this guy is good.
son of a bitch.
Jane, Speaker Haffley on line two.
Yes, Mr. Speaker.
what's the word on the street?
the Speaker thinks the press conference was brilliant.
I hope you took full credit.
msnbc wants someone from the campaign to go live right now.
I can do it.
senator.
how are we doing on time?
not bad; about 20 minutes late.
better for us, Santos will be out of the building by the time we get there.
Bob. - Yeah?
tell the Secret Service I want to get five minutes with Santos before he leaves.
alone.
are you serious?
they're going to want to know what it's about.
just tell them...
it's personal.
Yes, Larry.
he answered every questions, didn't duck the tough ones.
yeah?
what's this about your guy wanting a meeting with Santos at the L. A. thing?
Hi, Josh.
what's this about?
first I've heard about it.
the message we got said it's something personal.
what's that supposed to mean?
maybe it's personal.
I'm not sending my guy to a meeting if we don't know what it's about.
good.
what do you mean, good?
I don't like sending my guy into a meeting I know nothing about.
if you could stop it, I'd owe you one.
Yeah.
I just got a call from Josh.
he wanted to know what the Santos meeting was about.
What'd you tell him?
the truth: that it was the first I'd heard of it.
you think Santos will show up?
not if Josh has anything to say about it.
I want to give him back his briefcase.
I figured.
when in doubt, do the right thing.
the rest of the time, get away with whatever you can.
who said that?
it must have been one of those Louisiana governors.
Yeah, probably from his jail cell.
you know, Santos never got the vetting a front-runner gets.
he was never supposed to get the nomination.
the press gave him a free ride in the primaries.
until now, he's been running way behind you, so the press still hasn't done their digging on him.
but they will now.
so, it really doesn't matter what you do with that briefcase.
it's going to come out.
if it comes out while Santos is in the White House...
I don't know what happens. All hell will break loose.
he wouldn't be the first President with an illegitimate child.
how far do you think he's going to get with that defense?
you know what, if I agreed with a candidate on the issues, and I was ready to vote for him, and something like this came out about him,
I'd still vote for him.
good. That's you.
and that's maybe most Santos voters.
and it is every voter in France.
but it is not this country, not yet.
I don't want people wishing they could change their votes after this comes out.
the voters have a right to know about it before making their voting decision.
come on, Bruno. This is me you're talking to.
please don't try to turn mud-slinging into a "Respect the Voters" spiel.
don't tell anyone, but I don respect the voters.
that's why I win.
I find out what they care about.
I don't try to tell them what they care about.
that's not exactly my idea of leadership.
it's my idea of democracy.
the voters get to set the terms of the elections, not us.
they get to decide what's important, not us.
that's why I think voters have a right to this information about Santos now instead of six months from now.
they could be electing a President who's drowning in scandal when he's supposed to be trying to stop World War III from starting in Kazakhstan.
and that is not the kind of guy most of the country wants to be the next Commander-In-Chief.
thank you! Thank you, very much.
what harm could it do?
it's the principal of the thing.
which is?
we like to know what a meeting is about before we agree to it.
five minutes?
that's what they say.
whose idea was the press conference?
I couldn't let you have California all to yourself.
Ah, I should have known.
well, I've got something for you.
Bruno found it in the holding room in Philadelphia.
you look through it?
well, no name tag on it.
it took 24 hours to get back to me.
you find anything interesting in my notes?
I didn't read them.
but Bruno did.
you don't have to worry about that.
I don't?
no one else knows about this.
Bruno, you and me?
that's it. And we're not going to tell anyone.
or maybe I should tell the press that Bruno stole my briefcase.
he didn't steal it. He found it.
it's not your notes you should be worrying about.
the checks you've been writing are a much bigger problem.
you think so.
we're not going to tell anyone about the checks. But you should.
so that's what this meeting is all about? You just wanted to give me a little advice?
obviously, it's up to you how you handle this.
that's right. It's up to me.
we're not going to use it.
but it's going to come out eventually.
the press is going to find out.
they're going to find Anita Morales.
camera crews are going to follow her daughter to school.
Bruno really did his homework, huh?
you think the people who work for you wouldn't have done exactly the same thing if they had found my briefcase?
if the press finds out about this next week, then all that happens is you lose an election.
but if you win and the press finds out next month or next year then I don't know what happens to you or your Presidency.
that's what you have to think about.
right now, you have a responsibility to the voters to...
don't lecture me about responsibilities.
do you really think you can handle this if it comes out while you're living in the White House with your family?
do you really want to put the country through that?
put your wife through that?
my wife knows all about it.
my brother's never been good about living up to his responsibilities.
he went out with Anita for a while and then disappeared like he always does.
he's never really been able to hold onto a job.
when I found out about the baby I figured somebody had to step up.
that would have looked a lot better if you had given your brother the money and let him pay the child support.
Yeah, well, I wish I could trust him to do that.
you don't believe me.
it doesn't matter what I believe.
you know the truth.
this is a family thing.
the RNC has a team of lawyers who wanna file for a re-count.
no. - If this happens and you don't challenge it, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
gonna get the mail.
we'll need a few minutes to shut down the street.
to walk to the mailbox?
to have a hot dog, everyone had to be issued ID pins.
get the president-elect on the phone.
I wanna congratulate him.
Arnie Vinick made this a better campaign...
... and he's made this a better country for all of us.
we have the cold front moving into the Midwest.
it's expected to drop a foot of snow in downtown Des Moines...
... and at least 15 inches in outlying areas.
we got reports in the last hour of flurries in Washaw County...
gentlemen, good morning.
good to see you again. How you been?
good morning. - Good morning, sir.
this is Senator Vinick's office.
no one can take your call at the moment.
senator, what are you doing here?
my office, isn't it?
at least for another month.
Where's Sheila? - Had a breakfast meeting.
job interview. - With who?
Royce. - Majority leader wants her, huh?
everybody wants her.
seems like every message I take now is a job offer for Sheila.
I wanna call every state-party chairman, starting with Iowa and New Hampshire.
thank them for what they did.
should I pack and ship these, or do you...?
did you hear me? - Yeah. State-party chairmen. Sure.
today. - I'll go get a list.
I wanna call every member of my fundraising committee.
send letters to the big contributors.
Oh, and I should call every Republican governor.
give me that set of cards you were keeping on everybody in every state we were in.
again, I don't want to start making announcements about cabinet posts until we have first made a decision about the vice-presidency...
...which you all know is very important.
I thank you all.
thank you. - Very busy day today. Thank you.
I wanted to thank you again for all your hard work...
...and let you know if there's ever anything I can do for you, I'll be on the next plane out of here.
okay. Thanks, Al.
who's next? - Hey.
to what do we owe the honor?
I need to make some calls.
senator Vinick's office. - We could use help with the boxes.
so Royce, huh? - Maybe.
is he gonna run for president?
he knows he has no chance.
but I told him to keep buzz going, it'll help fundraising.
he wants you to run the majority leader's office?
Dr. Wexler says they can move your physical to today, but...
good. I wanna get that done. - But you gotta get there now.
Annie, get the "thank you" letters done, and I'll sign them when I get back.
I want 10 minutes with every Republican senator before they kick me out.
not too many of them around with the Senate out of session.
I'll go to their home states if I have to. I gotta thank them, let them know...
Hey, tell Bob I wanna go over the exit polls with him later.
who's gonna tell him?
what? - That the campaign is over.
Adam, I am not trying to tell you or the Times how to cover a story.
what I am saying is that if you report that he's picked a vice president...
...you will make the best paper in America very, very wrong.
Yes, senator, the president-elect will certainly take that into consideration.
this is Linda. - I have an aunt named Linda.
that's great. Do you have any friends named Linda?
no. - Well, you do now.
and this is Kevin.
Linda and Kevin are gonna be with you most of the time.
now, because a lot of people know who your dad is...
everyone knows who my dad is. - I guess you're right.
some of them might try to talk to him or get a message to him through you.
you think that's a good idea? - No?
that's right, Peter.
we need talk V. P.
if anyone tries to do that, you should tell Linda or Kevin about it right away.
and they'll give the message to my dad?
well, it's not quite that simple.
our lawyers now have a legal theory...
...your electoral delegates can vote for whomever they want for vice president.
theory? - No precedent. Theory's best we can do.
supported by four former Democratic and Republican attorneys general.
and they'll say so publicly?
they'll take out a full-page ad in the New York Times.
by which I mean they'll sign a full-page ad if we pay for it.
as will a handful of former solicitors general from both parties.
so I can pick whoever I want and the Electoral College will elect him?
republicans might challenge it in court. - But we'll win?
might take a while. - You done here?
we're just... - It's scary in there.
the kids seem okay with it.
how would you feel if you were 5 years old and people with guns were telling you they're gonna take over your life?
sorry. This is my fault. - Nothing to do with you.
what you are talking about can wait.
what we're talking about is keeping your children alive.
your hand healed faster than I expected.
maybe that's because I went from a thousand handshakes a day to none.
I'll have your blood-cholesterol levels in a few days.
if they're anything like last year, you got nothing to worry about.
did you get much exercise on the campaign trail?
none.
lot of stress. I hear that keeps you young.
if I had your stress levels...
...you'd have been called on to deliver an eloquent eulogy for me 10 years ago.
so? - So you're fine.
fine? - You're in great shape.
for a man my age? - For a man half your age.
you're kind of a medical miracle, actually, huh?
president Bartlet and the first lady are on their way to Brussels today for the president's last G8 meeting...
... where the crisis in Kazakhstan...
do you have the list for assistant secretary of defense?
there are 15 assistant secretaries of defense. Stay focused on the big stuff.
all right, let me take another look at the file for State.
Kansas City Star wants me to confirm or deny Keenitz for Agriculture.
how did that leak? - Once the FBI starts background checks...
...neighbors figure it out. - Leak other names.
it might pull press heat off the V. P. Selection.
I've decided on a V. P.
do we have Nancy McNally's financial-disclosure statement?
who is your choice for vice president? - Baker.
you should announce that right away.
and publicly ask Democratic electors to vote for Baker when Electoral College meets. - Only way we get Baker.
if you wait and submit Baker for confirmation...
...Republicans won't let you have him.
they won't confirm a strong V. P. Who could win the presidency in eight years.
handing this off to the Electoral College just doesn't feel right.
the American people will not stand for 272 people they've never heard of electing a V. P.
people don't care. They don't vote V. P. They vote the top of the ticket.
if he has to take over the presidency...
...then people should know how he got there.
if he goes through a congressional confirmation...
...hearings of the House, the Senate, the works...
...the country will know everything about him before he takes office.
if you're gonna submit a name to Congress, it can't be Baker.
got a lot of offers to sit on boards.
all the pharmaceuticals want you, all the airlines.
as your lawyer, I have to advise you to avoid the bankrupt ones...
...unless you love giving depositions all day.
I don't wanna sit on boards. - Letters to governors.
great. - You don't have to do anything as a member of a board of directors. Show up a few times a year.
hundred thousand in salary and more in stock options.
you sit on half-a-dozen boards, you're making...
wouldn't look good.
who cares what it looks like?
no offense, Arnie, but nobody notices what former senators do.
what else you got?
lots of university offers. You can write your own ticket.
full-time faculty, guest lecturer, whatever you wanna teach...
where? - NYU, Princeton, Penn...
university of Pennsylvania?
Yeah. UVA, Duke, Emory, Florida State, Ohio Wesleyan, and William and Mary.
all right, let's do guest lecturer at Penn, Florida State and Ohio Wesleyan.
all three? - I can write my own ticket, or not?
they'll go along with it.
but why do you wanna spend...? - What offers do we have in California?
you don't wanna be the official greeter at a vineyard, do you?
twenty-one and a half.
obviously that violates Houston's zoning laws, but we can get a waiver.
this fence is essential to securing the perimeter of your property. - Twenty-one feet high?
well, that's because the homes next door are so close to yours.
what's this?
the guardhouse we'll build on the sidewalk.
everyone: Friends, delivery men, etcetera will have to pass through to get into your house.
does it have to be so big?
it's smaller than we usually build.
trying to blend into the neighborhood. - Really? Who else has a guardhouse?
the plans might be able to be reined in a bit depending on how often the first family is gonna use the house.
use it? We're going to be living in it.
we've decided to let the kids finish their school year in Houston...
...and then bring them to the White House in June.
so the first lady and the children...
...will be living there full-time until June? - Pretty much.
could you excuse me a minute?
is there a problem? - He's gotta let the director know.
gonna put a lot of strain on the PPD. - PPD?
presidential Protective Division.
permanent split in the family's gonna stretch us thin.
not a permanent split. - I understand.
but we're really not set up for the president and the first lady to be apart more than a couple weeks: International trips, that sort of thing.
got the exit polls for him.
great. Now he can really obsess over why he lost.
you gotta talk to him about money. - You're his oldest friend.
if you can't get through to him, I can't. - He's refusing to join boards.
he just wants to do guest lecturing at universities in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida.
he's gonna be bored to death...
...and he won't be able to afford the Republican lifestyle he deserves.
my apology, sir. The director would like to redo the security plan for your home including sealing the street with guardhouses at each end.
sealing the street?
only residents to drive on the street.
all visitors to any house on the street have to pass through the guardhouses.
we'll check social security and birthdays, same as the White House.
our neighbors become prisoners in their homes?
they'll be on the... - Safest street in Houston.
excuse us.
you okay? - No.
they're just trying to do their job... - This is not gonna work.
we should all move to the White House with you in January.
we better start looking for schools for the kids, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, Bob, you got the exit polls?
right here. Pretty simple.
we lost Nevada by 70, 000 votes because of the nuclear accident.
what page is Nevada? - Right here.
you're not set for life, you know.
Jim tell you I don't wanna waste time on boards?
I think he mentioned something about that, yeah.
my Senate pension will be plenty.
I'll pick up pocket change on the lecture circuit.
Where's the demographic breakdown? - Take a job with a D. C. law firm.
I won't do lobbying. It wouldn't look good.
you wouldn't have to do any lobbying. - Wouldn't look good?
lecturing in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida?
are you thinking about running again?
flip 40, 000 votes in Nevada, and I win.
senator, you can't be seriously thinking about...
doctor says I'm in great shape.
tell me who the front-runner or the Republican nomination is gonna be, huh?
one of the seven dwarfs that I just beat?
those guys have "loser" written all over them.
ray Sullivan's a front-runner already. Everybody said he did a great job with the V. P. Campaign. - I created Ray Sullivan.
where would he be if I didn't put him on the ticket?
he won't run if I run. - You wanna bet on that?
everyone in the Republican Party knows I had this locked until the nuclear accident.
that would kill any Republican candidate. The party can't blame me for that.
we would have had an Electoral College landslide if...
look. Look. Look at these exit polls.
nuclear power was the number one issue all over the West.
that's not gonna happen next time. Everything will be back to normal.
nuclear won't even show up in the next presidential exit polls.
I know what you're thinking.
go on, say it.
you think I'm too old.
don't worry about that. I feel great.
I'm telling you, 70 is the new 60.
the confirmation would be a breeze for Connor or Rosenthal for Treasury.
Connor would be a more popular choice within the party.
obviously, Rosenthal's more respected on Wall Street.
no, I think Rosenthal would be more effective selling my tax plan.
well, he has no administrative skills. Treasury is a huge department.
jurisdiction over the IRS, Bureau of Engraving, the Mint.
let's go with Rosenthal, and get him a deputy secretary who's got a lot of executive experience.
well, good.
so we've got Treasury, Defense and attorney general.
if you make a choice on State, we'll announce the big four the same time we announce the V. P. And show progress with the transition.
Nancy McNally's great, but I think she'd be a better U. N. Ambassador.
well, how about Noah for State?
Schmidt? - No. I want a fresh take on Kazakhstan...
...someone who was never part of the team that got us in there.
leaves Reynolds. - I had a good meeting with Reynolds...
...but I didn't get anything from him that I didn't already know.
no one has more experience. - I like him, but...
wanna take another look at his file? - No, let's move on.
we'll come back to State. - Okay.
well, we've got a couple of great candidates for Commerce.
Yes, sir.
general Corley will give you the Kazakhstan update as soon as you get off the plane.
I'll get them on the line now.
I need Stanley at State and Henry at Trade for a conference call with the president.
when? - Right now.
what's up? - Here's where we are so far.
we've got someone ready to go for every one of those job titles.
people should be ready to move out by Inauguration Day.
I'll let them know. - Things aren't moving so fast with State.
president-elect doesn't want any empty desks at State with the crisis still hot...
...so he'd like all the undersecretaries to plan to stay in place for a while.
he's having trouble picking a secretary? - He's staring at the short list.
I have no idea. I'm just the messenger.
she's on the short list. - Good.
Helen Santos is here. And Stanley is having his teeth whitened now...
...so they're trying to find someone at Trade to do the call.
okay. My once-proud team.
I'll just duck out this way.
problems with the first-lady-elect?
just not her favorite person today. - Come on.
it's nothing, really. I'll just slip out of your way.
Hello, Mrs. Santos, I'm C. J. Cregg. - I know. We get CNN in Texas.
do me a favor. - Anything.
please call me Helen. - Okay.
how we doing? - Everyone's ready but now the president's on another call.
the first lady would've shown you around...
...but she's on her way to Brussels.
they've asked me to make you feel at home.
in this place?
well, you'll see the residence does have some homey touches.
like? - You could get bunk beds for the kids.
I got to find a school for them first. - Jim Kane can help you with that.
the secretary of education? - Yeah.
Mr. Chairman, I'll definitely let you know about the V. P. Before the press knows.
drudge Report says it's Baker.
how does Drudge do it? - Is it Baker?
I am not going to reconsider. I want Eric Baker for vice president.
now, with the Democrats in the House, Baker will have no problem there.
how many Republican votes will we need in Senate?
five, at least.
more if anyone decides to filibuster.
won't try that on V. P. Confirmation.
they could. - Not if you talk to the leader give him the feeling he's being consulted, let him suggest names.
no. He'll try to jam me into taking someone I don't want.
if we can't count on enough Republican votes in the Senate...
...then I recommend that you ask the Electoral College to vote on Baker.
don't want to. - You might have to.
Baker's name is starting to leak, so if you're not gonna consult Senate...
...we need to make the announcement. - Gotta pressure the Republicans to confirm Baker. - How?
I wanna see Arnold Vinick.
you really think he's in the mood to help you with this?
I wanna see Arnold Vinick.
right says we lost because you weren't conservative enough...
...not the nuclear thing.
exactly. That's why I have to run again, to prove that isn't true.
I wasn't just running for the presidency.
I was fighting for the soul of my party. - You won that.
ray Sullivan, the most popular guy in the party, is a Vinick Republican.
you created a national candidate. He is your legacy.
pro-lifers like him, moderates love him.
your blessing can guarantee him the nomination.
you can be the kingmaker.
but not the king?
I just got a call from Barry Goodwin.
yeah? - Matt Santos wants to see you.
about what? - Sounds like a post-election handshake, a nice bipartisan photo op.
smart move by Santos. - I'm not gonna be a prop in some phony unity picture.
you don't go, they'll leak that you turned him down.
Santos will look bipartisan... - And I look like a sore loser.
the personal staff is waiting in the East Room.
most of them have been here a long time. They know their stuff.
I need a nanny-type and someone to help clean the kids' bedrooms.
I think they can manage that.
this is Curtis Schaefer. - Nice to meet you.
my pleasure, Mrs. Santos.
he is the chief usher. - Chief usher?
means he's the man in charge.
if it's all right, I thought we'd begin with a quick introduction...
...then split off into individual meetings with the executive chef.
the pastry chef, your children might have desserts he'll wanna know about.
the head florist would like a few minutes...
...just to get an impression of your and the president-elect's preferences.
the president-elect doesn't have a preference.
for the Oval Office? - He'll never notice flowers.
whatever you like is fine. - I understand.
no need to meet with the butlers and maids...
...but if you could spend a few minutes with the president-elect's valet.
he needs to finalize his... - I'm sorry.
could you excuse us for one minute, please?
Thanks.
Hey, this is too much. We don't need all these people.
okay, which ones do you want to fire?
president-elect's office, please hold.
president-elect's office, please hold.
president-elect's office, please hold.
Mr. Goodwin will be right with you. He's finishing a call.
if you'd like to take a seat. President-elect's office, please hold.
president-elect's office, please hold. President-elect's office, please hold.
this was a terrible idea. - You had no choice.
I'm standing here waiting like a... - Sit.
just keep talking to me as though I'm too busy to sit.
okay.
what do I have tomorrow? - You have a haircut at 10.
okay, then what? - That looks like it.
for the rest of the day? - For the rest of the year.
okay, well, let's confirm all that and make sure I have the updated schedules today.
Arnie, good to see you. - Congratulations, Barry.
listen, you ran one hell of a campaign. We just got lucky.
let me take your coat.
I'm sorry for the wait...
...but the president-elect had to step out with the wife to check out some schools for the kids.
he asked me to have you wait in here.
it won't be long.
can I get you anything? - I don't think so.
senator Robertson's on line three. - Excuse me. I've gotta take this.
do you think St. Albans was a little, you know, stuffy?
a little?
Bancroft was more down to earth. - Yep.
what?
the idea of spending $25, 000 for fifth grade.
ridiculous.
what would public school be like if we spent 25, 000 per pupil?
in one year, we will spend more for two kids than my entire education cost.
Hey, I actually got a paycheck at Annapolis.
where is the next school?
what next school? I thought we were only doing two schools today.
I told your scheduler we had three schools.
I can't do another school today. I have to get back to the office.
I've got Arnold Vinick waiting for me.
the president-elect is on the line for you.
hello. - Arnie, thanks for coming in to see me.
listen, I'm really sorry about the scheduling mix-up.
we're looking at schools for kids, and it's taking longer than we thought.
I understand.
can we push our meeting back about an hour?
well, my schedule's pretty busy these days.
let's see what our staffs can work out. - Yeah, sure.
I really appreciate any time that you can give me today.
and again, I'm sorry about having to reschedule.
no problem.
grande, nonfat chai for Jim.
coffee of the day. - Tall, grande or venti?
what size? - Whatever's biggest.
name? - Sen...
venti coffee of the day for Ernie.
I wouldn't send our kids to that school if they paid us.
I didn't see a single kid smiling in there.
so it's Bancroft, I guess.
maybe we should look at some public schools too.
D. C. Public schools are the worst.
didn't Vinick say something like D. C. Has the lowest test scores in the country?
well, there's gotta be some good public schools in the district.
Hello?
Yes, we are on our way right now.
I am late for the White House decorator.
there's gotta be at least one good public school.
do you know any congressmen who send their kids to D. C. Public schools?
what's this about? Afraid they're gonna get spoiled going to a rich kids' school?
a little, yeah.
you think having one maid pick up their socks...
...and another pick up their underwear is not going to spoil them?
going to a fancy private school is gonna be the most normal thing about them.
Yeah, but...
you wanna look at a public school, we will look at a public school, okay?
I need the schedule for tomorrow's G8 meeting...
...and the joint statement on Kazakhstan.
trade rep wants you to okay this memo on agricultural subsidies going to the president.
Hi. - Hi.
I have a 3: 00.
with the decorator. - Oh, right. That's in there.
Oh, thanks.
and this is the language State approved for tomorrow's briefing.
Mrs. Santos.
Mrs. Santos, I'm Gail Addison. - It's nice to meet you.
as you know, we have very little in the budget for redecorating.
Oh, well, how much is very little? - Two hundred thousand.
you might want to establish a fundraising committee...
...to raise a few million and do it right.
there really is a lot to do, especially in this room.
I've never liked the color of this rug, but the Bartlets...
well, it's all up to you now.
well, it looks good to me.
Oh, but there are many ways you can put your personal touch on the White House.
well, I will leave that up to my kids.
there are gonna be a lot of crayon marks that we'll have to remove when we leave.
speaking of the kids...
here's what I've sketched for Peter's room, a cowboy theme.
and here's what I came up with for Miranda's room.
a place a princess would love.
that'll work. Yeah, okay.
Arnie, thanks so much for coming in.
I'm sorry about that scheduling screwup. - It's okay.
I'm booked every minute of the day now.
it's worse than the campaign. No time to think at all.
in any event, I appreciate you rescheduling so fast.
where are the cameras?
this isn't a photo op.
would you like some coffee? - No, thanks.
please.
I need your advice.
my advice? - Yeah.
on what? - The vice-presidency.
what about it?
I have a legal memo that says...
...that I can ask the Electoral College to vote for whoever I want...
you can't let 272 people no one has ever heard of elect the vice president of the United States.
if you're gonna have an unelected V. P...
...at least let the elected representatives of the people vote for him...
...and to submit the name for congressional confirmation.
you gotta go through an open process...
...public process that people understand and accept.
I agree.
you do? - Yeah.
do you think the Senate Republicans will get rough?
well, that depends on who you pick.
is the vice-presidency something that you would consider?
are you offering it? - Would you consider it?
if you offered it? - If I offered it.
to a Republican? - To you.
would I consider it?
and if I considered it, you'd put me on your short list?
Yes. - You still gonna try to raise taxes?
only on incomes over a million. - So you'd offer the vice-presidency to someone who, if anything happened to you would be trying to cut those taxes while your body was still warm?
I might.
if I considered it?
nice try. I know your game.
get me to say I'd consider it, then you have your people leak it to the press.
and that gives you a couple of days of stories about...
...how bipartisan Matt Santos is. I mean, "He's even got a Republican...
...on his short list for vice president.
you figure that'll soften the Republicans...
...and they'll talk about a confirmation for Vinick.
then you announce who you really want, which I assume is Baker.
then you put public pressure on the Senate...
...to give the same speedy confirmation to Baker that they were gonna give to Vinick.
what do you think of Baker?
I think he wins you Pennsylvania.
I think he has a lock on the presidential nomination eight years from now.
senate Republicans are gonna have a little problem with that.
what are you gonna do next?
I'll do what I'm what I'm good at.
you're going to run again?
I hope you get your tax increase. It'll give me something to run against.
you got a minute to talk about Kazakhstan?
I don't get a daily intelligence report. All I know is what I read in the papers.
a lot of what you read is better than our intelligence.
I was impressed with what you said about Kazakhstan during the campaign.
I always had wished that I had said it first.
the good cop, bad cop routine you and Bartlet worked out seems to be the only thing you can do.
what do you mean? - You two must've coordinated messages.
you're not reckless enough to undermine the president on foreign policy in the middle of a crisis.
you're trying to make the Russians and the Chinese believe that it's gonna be tougher to deal with you than Bartlet.
put pressure on them to negotiate a settlement with Bartlet now.
well, it could work.
I'm gonna need another cop when Bartlet leaves office.
how about Secretary of State?
you gonna go with Reynolds? - Maybe. If I don't get my first choice.
who's that? - That would be you.
secretary of State?
you've got better relationships with all the important heads of state than I do.
you know the diplomatic corps. You're respected in every capital in the world.
you agree with me on foreign policy.
and you are the best strategic thinker I know.
I'm not asking you if you'd consider it, Arnie, I'm asking you to do it.
what happened to the game of getting him to consider V. P?
he read that play. The guy's brilliant.
he's a Republican. - He's who we need.
you're saying there's not a Democrat who can handle State as well as Vinick?
well, that's not exactly what I would go out there and say publicly, but yeah.
well, he's not going to accept it.
but he'll make sure the press finds out whoever we end up with was second.
he's not gonna leak it. - Sure he is.
he never leaked that Bartlet offered him that U. N. Job.
was he serious about running again?
Yeah. - Then he's gonna leak this.
maybe, but this is the risk I've decided to take.
secretary of State? - He gave me the hard sell.
country needs you, the whole bit. - What did you say?
I turned him down, on the spot.
and then he asked me to sleep on it and give him my final answer tomorrow.
you gotta do this. It's perfect for you.
you ran a campaign to try to unify the country.
now it looks like Santos is trying to put together an administration that will unify the country. The president says he needs you.
the country needs you. - I disagree with him about everything.
not everything. - You don't disagree on foreign policy.
you think about it differently, you use different rhetoric...
...but you agree on the objectives.
he just wants to take me out of the campaign.
he's afraid to run against me again.
okay, he's just using me.
he appoints a Republican so the Republicans'll let him have Baker as V. P.
he doesn't really want me. - They'd horse-trade with a job like State?
no.
you really don't think I can win, do you?
maybe if you were 10 years younger.
baby boomers are turning 60. There's gonna be a huge over-60 vote in the next election. - You're not a boomer.
should've started lying about my age long ago.
it's not just your age.
stevenson got the nomination twice in a row.
fifty years ago, and he lost both times.
you know, the only thing that tempts me to do this is Santos' second choice. Reynolds.
wanna see a Secretary of State screw up the world, give the job to Reynolds.
you can enter the history books as maybe the last honorable senator and a great secretary of state.
or you can be the guy who just didn't know when to quit.
the students seem pretty happy here.
we've got a great group of kids, and the parents are very supportive.
what's the makeup of the student body?
forty-one percent African-American, 30 percent white...
...19 percent Hispanic, and 9 percent Asian.
how many free-lunch kids?
eight percent.
that sounds low for the district. - The lowest.
I'm a bit surprised there are no metal detectors in the school.
D. C. Doesn't have any metal detectors in the elementary schools.
that's okay. We know what our public image is.
that's why it's an honor for us you'd consider sending your children here.
needless to say, it would be an incredible show of support for the system if you would.
sorry. I shouldn't... - Cathy, you run a great school.
you'll be hearing from us. - Thank you.
thank you very much. - Thank you.
what do you think?
it's perfect.
the president-elect's office, please hold.
senator Vinick, the president-elect is waiting. I'll let him know you're here.
president-elect's office, please hold.
let it leak that I'm considering asking the Electoral College to vote for Baker.
the Republicans'll start screaming, demanding confirmation hearings.
I say, "I'm concerned congressional confirmation will take too long.
this is too dangerous a time to be without a V. P. even for a day.
force Republicans to swear to run a quick confirmation.
then call them on it.
get that new Democratic House to run a quick confirmation and a vote.
put pressure on the Senate to act fast.
don't give them time to come up with phony reasons to vote against Baker.
Vinick's here.
Hey, Arnie.
you can go right in.
what's he trying to pull, Barry?
it sure as hell wasn't my idea.
and you'd be doing me a big favor with the party if you turn it down.
Arnie, I really appreciate you coming. - Your strategy's not gonna work.
which strategy?
you knew I'd turn this down.
you leak that you offered me State, so you look like Mr. Bipartisan.
I haven't leaked it. - Yet.
you think offering me State will help you get Baker past Senate.
everyone will know it's a phony offer. - This isn't about Baker.
I want you as Secretary of State. You're my first choice.
I wouldn't lift a finger to help Baker with Republicans.
I'll get Baker confirmed. I don't need you for that.
secretary of State is not something you throw at the other party to show how bipartisan you are. The job is way more important than that.
this is your representative to the world.
I agree.
you think you can make me Secretary of State and then ignore me and run all foreign policy out of the White House?
no. - Anybody good enough to appoint would quit the day you try to go around the State Department.
I don't want to go around you. I want you to do the job.
and when we disagree? - I'd give you the time you need to set me straight.
and then I'd expect you to go out there and sell whatever decision I've made.
I'd have to have my own deputy secretary.
pick any Democrat you want.
and the undersecretaries? - I will consult with you on all of them.
I wouldn't do one thing that smelled of campaigning for you.
I'd never set foot in your fundraisers and you couldn't drag me to a Democratic Party event.
obviously.
if the undersecretary for political affairs does one partisan thing, I'm out.
I understand.
I don't know. I don't know.
this is crazy. I don't see how this can work.
here's today's intelligence report on Kazakhstan.
there's a interesting item in there on page two.
second paragraph.
what, the Chinese demanding a veto on routing of the pipeline?
Yeah, they've never said that before.
don't worry. Chinese know they haven't a chance of getting that, but they think the Russians do.
so they demand it now before the Russians, so we won't help either one.
so how do we move them out of their positions and get them to agree to a compromise?
you can lay the groundwork for that now.
you let both sides know that in the endgame...
...the Russians will have to get a share of Kazakhstan oil production...
...and the Chinese are gonna have to have the pipeline.
you make sure they understand you're the one setting the agenda.
you don't have to make it explicit, just hint at it.
put yourself in the position...
you can do more in a day than most do in a lifetime.
you think I'm not aware I'm living my obituary right now?
kennedy School needs a new dean. Everyone wants you.
is today the day for this?
how about Secretary of State?
you gonna go with Reynolds? - If I don't get my first choice.
who's that? - That would be you.
if I'm gonna jump off the cliff...
...and you're gonna get pushed off the cliff...
...why don't we hold hands on the way down?
you could leave it here.
you know, on the off chance you're back someday with bad breath.
you're sweet. What time is it?
six forty-five. - How did that happen?
I thought maybe Barton's tonight.
for dinner? - Yeah.
I have the Trade Commission. - Okay.
did I say I was free? - Yeah.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't speak when I don't have my book.
my sister's in town tomorrow night.
wanna meet? - We're finalizing the budget.
well, she's here Thursday too. - Intelligence review.
all right, I'm bailing on dinner.
I'm sorry, this week is just... - No worries.
I feel bad. I'd love to meet your sister. - You would.
she's like me, but with bigger teeth.
this week is just... - No is a perfectly acceptable answer.
you gotta be able to ask, right? - I just feel bad saying no all the time.
it makes me feel like a heel. - So I shouldn't ask?
I should sit by the fire and wait for my booty call?
of course not.
it's okay, I'm not turning it down, but it's limiting.
you make it sound like I'm trying to avoid you.
I didn't say that. - I don't make booty calls.
you don't make any calls.
kind of how it works out. - What?
you're elusive. Part of the draw.
you know what? It's way too early for this.
what? - It's 6: 45 a. m.
Hey, I'm kidding.
are you? - Yeah.
everybody take a breath.
okay.
I'm sorry. - There's nothing to be sorry about.
you're right. This will all be easier in two weeks.
it really will. - Come here.
Hi.
tell Kuber I found 14 errors in 16 pages.
they should think about proofing these before they hit my desk.
would you like to take a walk? - What did you think was happening now?
you could go across the street, get some breakfast.
maybe a scone? - I don't want a scone.
they have fruit. - I'm not hungry.
it's a nice day with fresh air. You could have a little fun.
I have a schedule, right? We're not pretending I have a job.
like Dad, who no longer runs the company, but still shows up every day?
it's a full day, but not crazy. You could say hello to Will Bailey.
step aside.
Charlie and I were trying to get a jump on some filing.
we thought we'd have it cleaned up, but things got a little out of control.
I've seen messy before. - I don't think you should go in.
Yeah, I'm getting that. - Seriously.
you're not filing, you're packing.
Yeah. - Yeah.
okay.
most of this is going to the archive.
a guy named Martine is supposed to pick it up.
don't worry. - We're gonna move it somewhere...
...but haven't settled on where. - Margaret...
I shouldn't worry. - You shouldn't. Get Fred and Herb in.
nice, huh? - This is grim.
roosevelt Room in 10. - What am I doing there?
a casual conversation about your future. - Another one?
we're nearing the end of the list. This is a guy from Hollis.
how about this is the end of the list? We cancel the rest...
...send a "thanks," but no thanks.
ten minutes. - Job interviews?
headhunters waving stock options and corporate jets.
all I have to do is show up at the occasional board meeting.
why should I find that appealing? - They don't know you're a masochist.
I like to work for a living. Is it odd? - I get it.
you must be getting these. - Yeah. Defense contractors mostly.
you interested? - Maybe.
it's hard to get excited about anything after this.
Yeah. - I've got a call...
...with the Chinese defense minister at 4. You should sit in.
tell Margaret. Hey, where's your transition memo?
it's coming. - When?
soon. - Did you start it?
Yeah, sure. Final touches.
I want it today. - Absolutely.
we were summoned? - You were.
I read the first half of the budget. Couldn't find the deficit reduction.
it shouldn't be buried on page 600. It should be up top.
is it on page 600? - No.
where is it? - There isn't any.
what do you mean there isn't any? - There's no...
the president wants deficit reduction in the budget. I said it should be 50 percent.
we thought it was along the lines of "I'd like a pony."
nobody actually expects to get the pony. - I want the pony.
fifty percent reduction is unrealistic. - It isn't.
go find revenue raisers and cost savers...
...to cut the deficit in half, and then release it...
...to White House, OMB and the agency senior staff this afternoon for comments.
we need to integrate everybody's feedback.
what? - You're talking about doing work...
...on a document nobody will ever read.
it's a formality. - We're leaving office.
Really? - I don't know where to find $ 150 billion.
I told you where you could. Did we or did we not...?
the tax proposed was massive. - Was that your idea or the president's?
it was the president's idea to cut the deficit.
it was my idea to propose doing so...
with a massive increase... - Stop saying massive.
we have to get jobs when we leave. We can't...
do it! And send the damn thing out for departmental review. Now.
okay. - Yeah.
what?
wanted to see what the yelling was about.
what, are you just walking around? - Senioritis.
having a little trouble getting motivated.
I probably shouldn't share that with the boss.
Where's your transition memo? - My epitaph?
they're important documents that make it possible...
...for your successor to take the baton. Write one.
Greg Thatcher's moving over to State.
Santos made him an offer. Wants to get started as soon as possible.
did he write...? - I'll deal with it.
then I guess it's okay. He's leaving Friday?
today, I think. You should say goodbye or something.
Yeah. Tell him to stop in.
you're needed in the Roosevelt Room. - Call all 30 department heads.
explain that when I said I needed the memos today, I wasn't making a funny.
your Hollis meeting is right now. - Give me five minutes. Get him a Coke.
we shouldn't keep him waiting. - He's a headhunter.
I'm a highly placed official...
...in what was once considered a fairly prestigious organization.
he can sit quietly and have a Coke.
it's not a headhunter from Hollis, it's Franklin Hollis.
Franklin Hollis is in the Roosevelt Room?
Yes. - No, he's not.
what do I get out of lying in this moment?
Hollis is in the Roosevelt Room.
Really? - There's a guy in the Roosevelt Room...
...looks just like Frank Hollis. The hair, glasses, whole bit.
it's Frank Hollis. - Really?
he just bought an island. And Montana.
he didn't buy Montana. He bought most of Montana.
Oh, my God. - Don't stare.
can I meet him? - I wanna meet him.
shouldn't go in together, it'd look not cool.
what's the last thing you did that looked cool?
I touched his hand. We shook.
now I'm uncomfortable. - Tell him you want a piece of Montana.
he's not giving it away. - What's he gonna do with it?
teeth? - You're fine.
think that these numbers should be...
okay, thanks, guys, I'll catch up with you in the lobby.
Yes, sir. - Good morning, Mr. Hollis.
I'm C. J. Cregg. - Call me Frank.
my dad had 200 shares of Hollis in 1992.
sold them. - You're kidding.
didn't see it going anywhere. - Think C. J. Goes to work for him?
he probably wants a toady to make nice with the FCC.
I'm heading over to the D-Triple-C in a few minutes.
they're making you an offer? - I think so.
...executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
sounds pretty good. - Could be. Nice place to work.
I get my hands in a lot of races without the water torture of any one race.
and I'd stay in Washington, which is nice.
you think? - Yeah. I mean, no pressure...
...but I like the idea of giving the future an opportunity...
...to unfold of its own accord.
our future? - Yeah.
I like that idea too.
I'm prepared to put together a fairly attractive package if you're willing to...
I'm not boring you, am I? - No, certainly not.
that doesn't happen till I start in on nanotechnology.
no, I'm sorry. I'm just...
...familiar with the package these days.
well, what does the package look like these days?
you're prepared to dramatically change my standard of living...
...if I'm prepared to sit on your board and spend an hour a month...
...advising you on your strategic relationship with the FCC.
that sounds like it'd be a waste of your time to me.
it does? - That's not the package.
okay. - I'm starting a foundation.
because if I hold on to all this money, I start to look impolite.
I wanna find a single problem I can attack...
...something which might actually have some kind of substantive effect.
maybe I should be fighting AIDS in Africa or maybe it's malaria.
could be clean air or election reform. I don't know.
but my sense is that...
...you would have a unique perspective on what that could be...
...and how to make it happen.
a single problem?
it's a complicated question...
highways is what you're looking for.
Really? - It's not sexy.
no one will ever raise money for it.
but nine out of 10 African aid projects fail...
...because the medicine or the personnel can't get to the people.
infrastructure's the problem.
blanket the continent with highways, then maybe start on plumbing.
also not sexy. - Makes for a lousy telethon.
it does.
well, if you think that's what needs fixing...
...I'll give you 10 billion dollars to fix it.
Hey, Will, come on in. - How goes it?
good. Thanks. Listen.
Andy Lowry, he's gonna be calling you about tickets to the inaugural.
we're out. You guys probably are too, but I had to get him off my call sheet.
I'll see what I can dig up. - Thanks.
so you gonna take some time off?
go sit on a beach or something? - Maybe.
I thought about hiking the Appalachian Trail...
...which I've always wanted to do, but don't wanna do it in February.
if I sit around till May, when it's warm, I'll lose my mind.
well, weekend in Vegas. - More likely.
Yeah, listen, we wouldn't rush you.
the D-Triple-C, we're dead until March anyhow.
it takes that long to recover from the inaugural.
so you come back when you're ready...
...help us put together a strategy for the board.
which races you think you're looking at?
maryland 3rd, North Carolina 1st. Florida 15th's gonna be a big one.
Oregon 4th? Heffinger's stepping down?
no. There's always the hope that we can unseat him...
...but it's a long shot. I should take it off the list.
he's a real son of a bitch. If you can boot him, you should.
I ran Chulo's campaign against him in '94.
we lost by 15 points, but he's one mean bastard.
well, he's got an iron grip on that district.
he hasn't done a thing for them. He's barely a seat warmer.
gotta be someone who can kick his ass.
Yeah, but the question is who. - I'm sure you'll dig up someone.
you won't find a sane person willing to pick a fight with Heffinger.
Really? - No way.
I mean, go for it. I love the attitude.
if you find me someone, we'll run him. I'm just not gonna hold my breath.
illinois 5th should be exciting. Looks like Faye Green wants to retire.
and there's gonna be all kinds of craziness in Arizona.
how was it? Was he fascinating?
he may not have people skills.
he's used to talking to machines. You can't hold that against him.
I think you should consider it. You can't say no to everything.
at least think about it.
Oh, my gosh, you're thinking about it.
it was just a conversation. - But it was interesting.
very. - Hi.
Andy. - How are you?
it's good to see you. - I didn't wanna interrupt.
I was in the building. I thought I'd ask if you had a hole in your schedule.
I wish I could. I'm a little slammed today.
you can do it now. - Really?
you have nothing now. - I have nothing. Come in.
how are the twins? - Oh, amazing. Inexhaustible.
we spend a lot of time arguing about socks.
you're pro, they're con? - Oh, Molly's con, Huck's pro.
but never more than one at a time.
God, they're gorgeous. - Yeah.
they get to spend more time with their dad, now that Toby's not working.
that must be nice.
so presidential pardons. 'Tis the season, right?
it is.
is Toby on a list somewhere?
the DOJ and the Pardon Attorney are reviewing applications...
...but I don't think anybody's had an opportunity to talk to the president.
are you planning to? - Bring it to the president?
I know this is awkward, and he's pissed off a lot of people...
...including you, and, God knows, the president...
...but he was attempting to save three astronauts...
...suffocating to death in a tin can...
...somewhere west of the moon... - Yeah.
the Union for Concerned Scientists thinks he should get a medal.
so does the Alliance for Nuclear Accountability...
...the Arms Control Advocacy Collaborative...
...the Council for a Livable World. - Andy...
did you read the New York Times Magazine?
there's a petition. - I saw it.
thousands of names, C. J.
people who think it's time for Bartlet to come home to his base...
...and acknowledge that carpeting the heavens with nukes is a crappy idea.
I know the president was angry. He has every right to be.
but we're talking about prison.
maybe the president's calmed down. I'd like you to talk to him about it.
I'll see what I can do.
he was your friend for a long time.
I'll see what I can do.
you should get going. - Yeah.
did you call Charlie? - He's on his way.
herb told me to tell you the budget went to department heads an hour ago.
he didn't want me to check the changes before it went?
I think he didn't.
he's a little turd. - I'll let him know.
this is the preliminary list. They're finalizing their recommendations.
this didn't go to the president yet?
no, they'll send it to him in the next day or two.
this is the people who actually applied for pardon.
the president can add names, but I don't think he's added any.
this is everyone who applied? - They've cut some already.
they've been through it. - Did you see the earlier lists?
I've got copies. - You read them?
Yeah, but I don't remember every name... - Toby Ziegler?
never appeared on a list.
which means he didn't apply. - Nope.
if the president wanted to commute his sentence, he could.
he can do whatever he wants to. - Yeah.
is he asking about it? - The president? He isn't.
are you? - I don't know.
it's a tough call. - Yeah. Thanks.
anything serious, you can find me at the president-elect's office.
I can't imagine this taking longer than 15 minutes.
they asked for a CV.
the Santos people? - Yes.
they asked for my resume? - Yes.
Hi. - Should I send them a list of references?
no, you shouldn't. - I'd be happy to speak on your behalf.
to the Santos people? - They really shouldn't need references.
they're offering me a job, purely as a courtesy...
...which I'll pretend to consider, purely as a formality.
there are some mistakes in the budget draft that went out.
you read it already? - Yeah.
it's 800 pages. - Okay, I didn't.
but Lucy Benoit did, and she's got crazy stories.
who's Lucy Benoit?
new reporter, business desk at the Times.
what happened to Jack? - Shingles.
Really? - Raging.
shingles doesn't force a man into retirement.
tax fraud is, I think, the real story. Shingles is a cover.
if I'm in the market for a cover, I'd pick something that's not...
viral? - Yeah.
any port in a storm.
I'm going across the street.
will you be sad you don't have a coat? - I'm fine.
so Who-sy Benoit. - Lucy, yes.
she seems to think we're proposing a 50-cent-per-gallon gas tax...
...which, I assume, must be a mistake.
why does a reporter have a budget I haven't released yet?
seventy-three department heads have it.
they've had it for less than two hours.
don't you think they'd wanna read a page before leaking?
no, since she's not the only one with a question.
can I tell her it's a mistake? - You can't.
because we're not talking about it yet? - That too, but it's also not a mistake.
fifty cents a gallon? You don't mean five cents?
I don't. - That's insane.
you know how many people you're gonna piss off?
many, many.
why does the president wanna stir up animosity...
...Two weeks before we leave office? - Because he's old and dotty?
he has a reason. - He does.
but we're not ready to discuss it. - We're really not.
I will kill the rumors. - Yeah. Kill whoever's blabbing.
because we're not ready to release it.
it's really cold out here. - I told you to wear a coat.
Hey.
what do you think about Tony Sharkey? - From Treasury?
his wife is younger than his daughter, but otherwise he's okay.
you think he gets anywhere against John Heffinger?
Oregon 4th? Probably not.
D-Triple-C's afraid to run anybody against Heffinger, they're wimping out.
if Sharkey's their option, I see their point.
Tony Sharkey's my opening salvo. I'm asking if you've got anybody better.
from Oregon? - I was thinking maybe Ina Horton...
...but she keeps publishing articles on eminent domain...
...that make her sound a little like Mao Tse-tung.
paul Kravitz is from Oregon. He put together our immigration plan.
he'd scare Heffinger's pants off.
also, Gil Siverly'd be great.
you've been very helpful. - No problem.
hello. - Hi.
I believe I'm here to see the president-elect.
great. What's your name?
C. J. Cregg. - Miss Cregg.
ronna Beckman, we met in Pittsburgh.
good to see you. - Nice to see you.
the president-elect is finishing a call.
can I take your coat? - Sure.
Hey. - Gil Siverly.
how's it going? - Good. Thanks for coming by.
wow, people are packing up, huh?
weird, isn't it? - Sure is.
have a seat.
the DOE must be in boxes too, right? - Well, the secretary's on his way out.
we assumed that Santos would want a new staff...
...what with his education program and all.
but so far, they're asking a lot of us to stay put.
were you ready to move on?
I've been at Department of Education for six years.
a change won't be the worst thing in the world.
ever think about running for office?
Really?
D-Triple-C thinks John Heffinger's seat in the Oregon 4th is ungettable.
I think they're wrong. - Heffinger's been there for 15 years.
I mean, they love him. - They know him. Nobody loves him.
be a nasty fight. - The best ones are.
I don't know.
don't get me wrong, I think Heffinger is an idiot, and he's probably corrupt...
...but I don't wanna move back home...
...and spend the next two years of my life begging money...
...from everybody I know just so I can get my ass handed to me.
I think you're underestimating the voters.
we've been running dead fish against Heffinger the last 10 years.
we put someone with a heartbeat in the ring, he's going down.
if it was anybody other than Heffinger...
Yeah.
let's talk about you coming to work for me.
sir, I'm so flattered that you'd even consider it...
...but Josh is gonna do a terrific job as chief of staff.
of course he is.
I'll be available to answer questions on the phone anytime.
you don't need to create an emeritus position just to keep me as a resource.
who said anything about an emeritus position?
sir, you're a true gentleman...
...I appreciate... - This isn't a courtesy call, it's an offer.
Seriously? - Institutional memory...
...is an invaluable commodity.
I'm not dumb enough to think we should be reinventing the wheel.
your name comes up at the top of every must-hire list we've made.
we're going to take office in the middle of a military incursion you helped launch.
we don't just want you, we need you.
the Russians are more willing to talk now than they were before the election.
between Josh and your Secretary of State...
...the situation will be well-supervised.
I don't think you have anything to worry about.
my Secretary of State's gonna be Arnold Vinick.
what?
I'm waiting a couple of days to announce it, but he's onboard.
arnold Vinick? - He'll be a huge help with Central Asia...
...but it's a big job, and I don't want it taking over my presidency.
we've got a cabinet to break in, a legislative program to sell...
sir, I never entertained the notion I'd stay in the White House.
I've been here a long, long time... - Give me two years, C. J.
just until we get things settled.
special counselor to the president?
sir, l... I wish that I could... - I'm sorry, we've got to...
I'd love to talk to you more about this...
...but they've kind of got me on a sprint today.
I see I'm gonna have to make this fast and dirty.
I'm the president-elect, and I'm asking you to help your country.
I'm probably not gonna take no for an answer.
so you go home and you think about it, and call me back with a yes.
thanks for coming in, C. J.
Hey, there you are. - Yes.
I asked you to be on the phone with the Chinese defense minister.
we'll need you to make the call. - Okay.
signal will put it through, he wants to feel like we're approaching him.
so don't say "thanks for calling." - Got it.
transition memos.
these are all of them? - So far.
there's supposed to be 30, this is three. - More to come.
is yours in this pile? - Not yet. Soon.
what exactly is the problem?
you may be asked to stay on, you may not. You may get promoted.
other people are coming in and need to know where to find the pencils.
they need to know what your staff was up to or finishing or starting.
they need to know how to do what you do.
this is an important part of governing. We're still governing.
why is this like pulling teeth?
you'll have it by the end of the day. - Thank you.
are you okay?
I think I just got an offer I can't refuse from Matt Santos.
that's great.
that's not great.
you've been here two years. It looks different on the far side of eight.
still. Nice to get the offer.
they'll be approaching you soon, I'm sure.
sure.
what do you think happens...
...if I ask the president to commute Toby Ziegler's sentence?
are you gonna ask him? - I don't know.
Really? - I'm asking for your opinion.
my opinion is he compromised a crucial defense-department program.
he undermined the president's authority.
he committed a federal offense. He goes to jail.
he's got young children, who for the next five years...
...will look at him in an orange jump suit across an aluminum picnic table.
and don't get me wrong, l... I'm furious at him.
I wanna kick him in the stomach a few times...
...but I don't want him to rot in the federal pokey.
it's not your decision, it's the president's.
if he wants to pardon him, he will. - So I don't even bring it up?
if you want to, bring it up...
...but I don't think this slipped the president's mind.
Yeah.
did Toby apply? - No.
he may not wanna put the president in a position.
I'm sure he doesn't. Still... - You should talk to him at least.
no matter what you do, give him a call.
Yeah.
have you spoken? - To Toby?
no. Not since he left.
Hi. - Hi.
Bye. - Yes.
got a few minutes? - Right now?
Yeah, can I kidnap you? Quick lunch? - It's a little late for lunch.
you eat already? - I didn't.
see? You gotta eat. Come on. - I have a packed day.
we'll make it quick. Very snappy.
come on, I... I wanna...
it's important.
got a minute? - Of course.
the Santos people offered national security advisor to Glen.
Really? - Yeah.
and he's saying yes? - Yeah.
damn. - I know. I knew it was a long shot...
...and I'm young for it, but still... - You wanted it.
they'll offer you something else. - Not under Glen. He can't stand me.
he's probably scared of you. - Whatever. He's not giving me a job.
that sucks. - It sucks a lot.
how'd it go at D-Triple-C?
nice offer, but it could be a little crazy-making.
it's already monopolized my whole day.
I got stuck on this one race that they think can't be won and I do.
which one? - Oregon 4th.
I thought if I could find the right guy, they'd get behind the idea...
...but as it turns out, there's a real dearth of ballsy Oregonians.
open it up. Find somebody good. They can establish residency in Oregon.
sure, they buy a house 180 days before the primary and they're in.
but then we're running a carpetbagger against a 15-year incumbent.
Yeah, but it's better than nothing. What if Oregon weren't a factor?
place needs a fresh face. Somebody smart, but not so wonky...
...you can't put him in front of a camera.
don't worry about that. Find someone you like.
you can always coach them through talking on the camera.
after the press-secretary stint...
...you have that down. - More or less.
God knows you know all there is to know about policy and campaigning.
you could push a monkey through the process.
between your Washington experience and your local-politics experience...
no. That doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, it does. - It doesn't.
I'm not moving to Oregon, for one thing. - Of course you are.
I'm not. We're... - We're what?
you'll win. You should run. - No, I won't...
it's the right thing. - No, seriously.
you'll win.
you could... - What?
move to Oregon? - I don't know.
I'm not moving to Oregon. - I'm not moving either.
no, I think you are.
you cold? - I'm fine.
you're racing there. Wanna slow down?
sorry. I wanna get there, so we can eat and get back.
there's no place. There's a vendor up the block.
we'll have a hot dog.
great. So, what was so important?
what? - You said it was important.
it's this. The walk. The day. - That's it?
you're locked up in that building all day. It was gorgeous out here.
I thought you should see it.
I have a packed day.
that's really sweet, but today is not the time for it.
okay, sorry. - No, it's okay.
it might do us good to see each other in the daylight.
we're together from 11 to midnight or 5 to 6 a. m.
we're both half asleep.
it leads to a lot of tension that's probably unnecessary...
...like this morning, for example.
I thought it might be a healthy 20 minutes. You can tell me about your day.
my day.
Yeah.
Franklin Hollis showed up in my office with the most attractive offer...
...I think I've ever heard, which I believe I'll have to turn down...
...because I had a meeting with the president-elect...
...and it looks like I'm gonna work in the White House a couple more years.
I don't see a guy with a hot dog.
did you say yes? - To Santos?
not yet. Probably tomorrow.
that's great. Just...
what?
did you consider talking to me about it?
are you serious? - Yeah, I'm serious.
no, I didn't. - That's great.
we don't have that relationship yet. - Apparently.
what made you think you should be making decisions about my career?
one, I'm not, I'm trying to be a part of a conversation about them.
two, if we don't have that kind of relationship, what kind do we have?
I don't... I don't wanna answer that question right now.
we agreed to discuss this after the inauguration.
not if you're working for Matt Santos. - You know what...?
first 100 days, agenda setting, first State of the Union.
talk to me after we release the budget, summit at Tashkent.
what else? - Okay...
we keep shoving this conversation downstream.
at some point, you have to choose to have a relationship.
we're not 25 anymore. At our age, you can't date a little...
...and screw a little, wait to see if you get sentimental at Christmas.
you have to decide you're gonna make another person a part of your life.
a partner.
I don't have time for this right now. - Yes, you do.
I called Margaret before I came by.
I'm not a moron. I called, and you have 20 minutes. Hell, you have an hour.
you're not the busiest girl in America. That's not your life anymore.
look...
...I'm not trying to turn you into Doris Day.
I know if we have a future together, I'd be Mr. C. J. Cregg. That's fine.
but you don't even see me in the picture, do you?
thank you.
that's useful information.
the president-elect needs to talk to you. - Now's not the best time.
I tried to push it, but he's already in the building.
fine.
sorry. - It's fine, but I have to go through...
...the federal budget with a lice comb. It'll take hours.
that's why we left room in the schedule. This is not a quiet day. It's a full day.
he's here.
Mr. President-Elect. - Walk with me to the Situation Room.
fifty cents a gallon? - You read our budget?
supposed to be a placeholder document. - Paperweight, yes.
you're proposing a tax that would hammer the working poor...
...and make Democrats look like Norwegian socialists.
it'll cut the deficit, improve air quality...
...reduce greenhouse gases, curb our addiction to Middle East oil.
there's a way to sell an upside. - Of course there is.
senate Republicans will set their hair on fire.
the president wanted to present a road map...
...for reasonable governing. - Road map? For the country or me?
it's what he would've done if he didn't have to mudwrestle Congress...
...over every... - Congress isn't going anywhere.
it opens a dialogue... - C. J. now is not the time.
now is exactly the time. We're hemorrhaging money into Kazakhstan.
the Republican Congress spent us into a bottomless hole.
I noticed. - You've got 100 days to corral...
...House Democrats and launch a legislative program...
...that balances the budget...
...or you're gonna spend the next four years in the shadow of our failures.
I'm not arguing on limits on deductions.
you got 100 billion in spending cuts that I'm all for. But come on...
congress will reject your first budget unless the Bartlet version...
...is so inflammatory, yours can't help but look reasoned and measured.
why not go after capital gains?
or up the income ceiling on Social Security taxes...
...if you wanna raise a ruckus?
he's talked about that for five years. - Yes, but...
he's never even considered a gas tax before.
was this even his idea?
the president supports... - Yes or no.
if we propose a 50-cent gas tax...
...It's a non-event if you propose a 5-cent tax.
jed Bartlet just saved you $30 billion.
you mean, you just saved me $30 billion.
well... - You're not wrong. It's a good idea.
how long did it take you to talk him into it?
more than five minutes, less than 20. If your staff...
...can't get you onboard faster, they don't know what they're talking about.
that's a good rule of thumb.
we're not trying to leave a dead cat on your doorstep.
a gas tax increase may be the single best thing...
...that could happen to this country. - Yeah.
tell the president I'd appreciate it if he pulled it from his budget.
you think it's worth doing? Come work for me.
we'll do it together.
good evening, sir. Mind if I take a quick look?
all clear. Thank you.
Thanks. - It's not a gift. I need a drink.
would you like to sit? - I sit all day.
should I be feeding you or just booze? - Booze is fine. I can't eat today.
you sure? I made a chicken. - No.
so how are you?
Oh, groovy.
when do you go? - Twenty-sixth.
what have you been doing? - Cooking this chicken took some time.
I read a lot. I've read really all the books at this point.
anything good? - I'll make you a list.
I read the Constitution. I think I found a typo.
in the Constitution? - Yeah.
did you call the publisher? - It's a typo in the original.
constitution? - Yeah.
sounds unlikely. - I read two versions...
...because I have time, and there's an inconsistent comma.
no. - So I looked at every English language...
...publication that exists. Half of them have the comma, half of them don't.
Really? - Yeah. I called the National Archives...
...and had some woman look at the original.
she said she wasn't sure if it was a comma or a smudge.
there's a smudge? - Yeah, a smudge of law.
does it change the...?
changes the meaning of the Takings Clause.
Seriously? I'm sure it doesn't. - I called Tom Merrill, he thinks it does.
Really? Should we do something? - I'm gonna write it up.
I have a window in the calendar.
it's Petersburg, right?
Yeah. Low security. Which certainly outshines the alternatives...
...but still... - Yeah.
bunks. Ten in a room. - Like camp.
exactly, like camp.
I'm sorry.
maybe we should try to do something. - Dig a tunnel?
Andy came by. She mentioned the idea of a pardon.
she and I need to have a conversation about who talks...
...to whom concerning my future. - She's worried about the twins.
for a moment, I thought you came because you gave a crap...
...and wanted to see how I was doing.
I gave a crap enough to ask if you wanted a pardon...
...despite the fact that you walked out on me and the president...
...while we still had a job to do.
you don't need a pardon, just a frying pan to the side of your head.
I don't want a pardon. - Well, that simplifies matters, thanks.
you don't wanna consider what this'll do to Molly and Huck?
you think I haven't?
okay.
and you? They must be flocking. - Yeah.
well, that's gotta feel pretty good. - Frank Hollis made me an offer.
yeah? - But so did Matt Santos.
well, he has to. - No.
it's a serious offer. He made me an offer...
...he made Arnold Vinick an offer.
secretary of State. - He did not.
he did.
that might be the smartest thing he's done.
impressive, huh? - You'd be a get too.
are you gonna do it?
probably. I...
I don't know. It's complicated.
Why?
I heard something about that. - We've spent time together...
...which is perfectly nice, but he's getting ahead of himself.
I mean, I'm not ready to shape my life around a guy I've been with for a month.
you didn't pick him up in a bar last Thursday.
you've been close for eight years.
that doesn't mean it magically falls into place once we take the leap.
what? I'm not resisting.
you're not? - I'm not a woman who can't...
...handle a good thing standing in front of them.
good. - Why don't you sound convinced?
you spend your whole life...
...working for powerful, demanding men 24/7.
that's a lot of testosterone in your world.
which has what to do with anything? - You didn't need to date.
you had Josh and Sam and me...
...and 180 reporters flirting with you day in and day out.
come on. - It's a lot of positive male attention.
now you're slotting in Matt Santos, maybe Frank Hollis.
so, what? You think this is a Freudian temper tantrum?
you showed up here at 8: 00 at night with a bottle of wine...
...asking me about a pardon we both know is out of the question...
...telling me about a man who's crowding you.
I think a lot of things. - You think I came to take advantage...
...before they cart you off? - I think you don't know why you came.
you're a woman with a lot of options.
you're acting like the world's backing you into a corner.
bouncing from one thing to the next, from Bartlet to Santos to Danny to me.
maybe you should stop bouncing, pick something.
what do you want?
I don't know.
I'd like to learn how to make a chicken like that.
stick a lemon up it and throw on some rosemary.
yeah? - Yeah. A little salt.
I'd like to learn how to ski.
that would be soothing. Be a ski bum. Operate the ski chair for six months.
clear my head. - It's a chair lift.
well, first I'd learn the lingo. Take it from there.
I missed you.
Yeah.
we had it good there for a while.
Yeah, we did.
you should go.
you kicking me out? - Yeah.
okay.
thanks for asking about the pardon. - Of course.
no, not of course. You didn't have to.
where to?
good evening, sir.
thank you, sir. - Thank you.
I missed the window. That's what's going on here.
I missed the window to figure out how to do this.
how to...? - Share my life with another person.
how to be a partner or whatever condescending way you put it this...
I wasn't trying... - I don't know how to do it.
maybe at one point I did, maybe I never did...
...but it's over now. It's too late.
this and skiing, it's too late. It's not gonna happen.
C. J... - You said yourself...
...It's not an accident that this hasn't come together.
this is who I am. I'm good at my job, Danny.
I'm good at working. I'm not good at this.
you're right. You suck at it.
you're gonna need a tremendous amount of training.
you're not gonna... - I am, actually.
train me? - I'll call it something else...
...that's bad. We'll deal with it.
I don't need training. - No, of course not.
that's not funny. - No, it isn't. You're gonna get good at it.
we're gonna get good at new things.
you don't know that. - I do.
don't make it sound like it's nothing. - You didn't miss it.
what if I did? - You didn't miss it.
what if we can't...? - We'll figure it out. All of it.
you... - You can be scared.
no, that's okay.
but you're not gonna walk away from me because you're scared.
I'm not that scary.
so do you want me to take...
...one of the board of directors jobs?
a couple hours a month. - Where did that come from?
I'm trying. You... You wanna be involved.
I'm... I'm... - I want you to do what you want.
take the job at the White House. Just talk to me about it.
I want us to talk about what it'll mean, and how it'll work.
I want us to talk like we're gonna figure it out together.
I want us to talk because I like the sound of your voice.
I just wanna talk.
Franklin Hollis wants me to take $10 billion and go and fix the world.
that sounds like fun.
does that sound like fun to you?
do you wanna work at the White House?
there's a typo in the Constitution.
well, someone should look into that.
Toby's gonna deal with it.
okay.
turn him over.
Oh, no!
do not drink wine nor strong drink...
...thou nor thy sons with thee...
...least ye shall die.
look not thou upon the wine when it is red...
...and when it bringeth his color in the cup when it moveth itself aright.
...at the last it biteth like a serpent...
...and stingeth like an adder.
now, folks...
...that's from the Good Book...
...but in this town...
...It's five cents a glass.
five cents a glass.
does anyone really think that is the price of a drink?!
the price of a drink let him decide...
...who has lost his courage and pride...
...who lays a grovelling heap of clay not far removed...
all's quiet, sir.
let's fall in.
follow me.
I beg your pardon.
I'm so sorry. - Allow me, ma'am.
thank you.
may I?
thank you.
Hey, Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!
look.
I don't care what you meant to do...
...I don't like what you did.
you inconvenienced this lady, and made a fool of yourself...
...and this railroad.
now, I want you to apologize to this...
Yes, may I help you?
if they move, kill them.
is he with them?
he's there.
hold your fire! Get down!
wait till they come out.
I can nail him.
I said, wait!
what if they go out the back?
it's covered. You two-bit redneck peckerwood.
Abe.
I solemnly promise...
...God helping me...
I solemnly promise, God helping me...
...to abstain from all fermented malt liquors...
...including wine, beer and cider.
...to abstain from liquor, wine, cider and beer.
people marching down the street. They'll pass by the horses.
we'll join them.
the Temperance Union?!
they should have been told.
told what?
how long can anybody in this manure pile keep his mouth shut?
"yes we gather at the river "The beautiful, beautiful river.
gather with the saints at the river.
rifles.
...no, three!
maybe more, there, on the roof.
get down.
son-of-a-bitch!
bounty hunters?
hell, I wouldn't know.
buck with Abe.
I kill them now?
hold them here as long as you can.
I'll hold them till hell freezes over or you say different.
when I kick him out, blast him.
we'll run for it.
give me that gun.
Oh the beautiful river.
"gather with the saints at the river "That flows by the throne of God.
set?
let's go!
good luck, boys!
they're blowing this town to hell!
you trash!
now you just hush now.
Hey, they were playing "Gather at the River."
you know that one?
sing it!
shall we gather at the river "Where bright angel feet have trod.
Hurry!
river that flows by the throne of God.
come on, you lazy bastard!
I'm coming!
they've cleared out, for chrissake!
let's go, T. C!
let's go!
take him!
he's mine!
he's mine!
he's mine!
I shot this one! Look at the size of that hole!
you just dig out that bullet and see if it ain't my. 06!
you know I shot him.
you'd claim the whole thing, wouldn't you?!
daddy! Daddy!
Damn!
damn, I can't get his money belt off!
you stupid damn fools!
why did you shoot this employee and let the others get away?
I didn't! My first shot killed this man right here!
liar!
he shot that employee while I dropped this bandit and them others too.
I must've killed all three of them.
what were we doing up on that roof?!
liar!
black liar!
don't talk like that to me.
I'm sorry.
come on, T. C. help me get his boots.
I think this will do pretty good.
next time, plan the massacre carefully, or I'll start with you.
why didn't you kill Pike when you had the chance?
Hey, stop!
stop!
feathers flew like a turkey!
they shouldn't have run. They shouldn't have run.
say!
well, how'd you like to kiss my sister's black cat's ass?
it's better than a hog-killing!
get them out of here!
we're holding you and your railroad responsible for this carnage!
innocent people are dead!
women dying and hurt because you used our town as a battlefield!
the railroad is going to pay for our loss of blood!
we were trying to catch outlaws!
you lured them in here!
the railroad has been blabbing about a big payload for weeks!
we represent the law!
pike, is that you?
I can ride.
I can ride.
I can't see, but I can ride.
No!
I can't ride.
finish it.
you boys want to move on, or stay and give him a...
...decent burial?
he was a good man.
we should bury him.
he's dead!
with a lot of men to keep him company!
too damn many!
I think the boys are right.
I'd like to say a few words for the dear dead departed.
maybe a few hymns'd be in order!
followed by a church supper...
...with a choir!
you crazy bastards, both of you!
Bishop, Engstrom...
...the Gorch brothers!
amounts to a total of $4, 500 and you let them ride out on you!
when the money value of the men you killed...
...less my commission adds up to $500!
any one of those pelts would have not only cleared you with the company...
...but have given you money to raise hell with!
we'll do better next time!
we'll do anything you say, but we'd appreciate liquor money tonight.
there won't be any tonight! You go after them in ten minutes!
get them! Get Pike and you'll be rich!
and if any one of you tries to quit on me...
...I'll pay a bonus of $1, 000...
...to the man that kills him!
let's pack it up then!
why should I let you go with them? - We've been over that.
you might join them again. You'd like that, wouldn't you?
what I like and what I need are two different things. Listen.
I don't want to go back to prison, never again.
but it's got to be my way! But I need some good men!
you saw what happened out there this morning!
you use what you have and see to it that it doesn't happen again...
...or I'll see to it that you spend the rest of your life behind bars.
try to run, I'll be after you.
I gave my word.
we'll see what it's worth!
six minutes.
tell me...
...how's it feel...
...getting paid for it?
getting paid to sit back and hire your killings with the law's arms around you?
how does it feel to be so goddamn right?
good.
you dirty son-of-a-bitch!
you've got 30 days to get Pike or 30 days to get back to Yuma.
you're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.
I want all of them back here, head down over a saddle.
thirty days to get Pike or 30 days back to Yuma.
I don't see nothing so lindo about it.
just looks like more of Texas to me.
you have no eyes.
got a half hour of light. Let's go.
Hello, little fella.
them other fellas... - They're not coming!
none of them?
but I got horses and saddles for them. - We'll need them, they won't.
about the sharing up.
it will be the same as always.
me and Tector don't think that he ought to get the same amount.
he's just starting out, and this is our opening for a new territory.
that's right.
I figure a share to that old goat for watching the horses is a share too much.
so, we decided...
...it ain't fair.
if you two don't like equal shares, why the hell don't you just take all of it?
why don't you answer me, you damned yellow trash?!
now, Pike, you know...
I don't know a damned thing except I either lead this bunch or end it now.
we divide it up like you say.
chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick.
silver rings.
silver rings, your butt! Them's washers! Damn!
bastards!
washers!
we shot our way out of that town for a dollar's worth of steel holes!
they set it up!
they? Who in the hell is "they"?!
They"?!
"they" is just plain and fancy "they."
that's who "they" is.
caught you, didn't they? Tied a tin can to your tail!
led you in and waltzed you out again!
Oh, my, what a bunch!
big tough ones!
here you are with a handful of holes, a thumb up your ass...
...and a big grin to pass the time of day with.
"They"!
who the hell is "they"?
railroad men.
bounty hunters.
Deke Thornton.
Deke Thornton?
he was one of them?
how come you didn't know that?
Hey, gringo.
you can have my silver.
come on, don't kill me.
you can have the silver.
but don't kill me.
please.
go on...
...go for it.
fall apart.
walk softly, boys.
what's our next move?
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.
three days, maybe.
we'll get news and go to the border.
maybe a payroll or bank.
maybe that damn railroad!
that damn railroad you're talking about sure isn't getting no easier.
and you boys ain't getting any younger.
we must start thinking beyond our guns.
those days are closing fast.
all your planning and talking damn near got us shot...
...over a few lousy bags of washers.
this was going to be me and Tector's last job!
we spent all our time and money getting ready for this!
you spent time and money running whores while I spent my stake setting it up!
I should have been running whores instead of stealing army horses!
while you did the planning...
...me and Tector was getting our bell rope pulled by two...
...Two mind you, Hondo whores!
and Pike was dreaming of washers!
he was.
you were matching whores...
...in tandem!
what's that?
one behind the other.
that's right! That's what we was doing!
Mr. Thornton.
you rode with Pike.
what kind of man we up against?
the best.
he never got caught.
this was going to be my last.
ain't getting around any better.
I'd like to make one good score and back off.
back off to what?
have you got anything lined up?
Pershing's got troops spread out all along the border.
every one of those garrisons will get a payroll.
that kind of information is kind of hard to come by.
I didn't say it's going to be easy, but it can be done.
he'll be waiting for us.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
come on Pike, let's go.
you sound like you're all caught up.
enough to know we've overstayed our welcome.
what's wrong with you?
we've got plenty of money to spend, and no worries.
they're not going to look for us in their own backyard.
how can you be so damn sure?
being sure is my business.
being sure is my business.
hold it!
relax.
it's just some champagne we ordered.
relax, it's just some champagne.
being sure is my business.
did you get him?
no, he got away.
you sure must have hurt that railroad.
they spent a lot of money setting up that ambush.
I caught up with them.
two or three times.
there was a man named Harrigan.
he used to have a way of doing things.
I made him change his ways.
and a hell of a lot of people...
...just can't stand to be wrong.
pride.
and they can't forget it.
that pride, being wrong, or learn by it.
how about us?
you reckon we learned...
...being wrong today?
I sure hope to God we did.
them's hot.
hot damn!
where in hell did you find him?
he ran with Thornton and me.
did his share of killing, and more.
around Langtry.
only now he does his killing with a coffee cup.
I wouldn't have it any other way either.
watch out, boys!
take it easy!
keep his head up! What's wrong with you?!
watch him, Tector!
Goddamn! Son-of-a-bitch!
get the horses up!
what the hell is going...
damned clumsy old bastard! - Get up!
get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!
help!
get over here! Help!
what's the matter with you, old man?!
leave him alone!
he'll get us all killed! I'm going to get rid of him.
you better not! We're sticking together, like it used to be.
when you side with a man, you stay with him. If you can't, you're an animal!
you're finished!
we're finished! All of us!
mount up.
appears Brother Pike needs help.
that Brother Pike and the old man Sykes...
...makes me wonder if it ain't time...
...to pick up my chips and find another game.
how can you side anybody when you can't get on your horse?
that was a fine talk you gave the boys about sticking together.
that Gorch came near killing me.
or me him.
damned old fool like me's not worth taking along!
we start together, we'll end together. - That's how I see it.
that's the way it's always been with me.
sorry about Deke.
I never figured him that way.
say...
...back there in Starbuck...
...how did my boy do?
your boy?
crazy Lee?
Yes, C. L. Clarence Lee.
my daughter's boy. Not too bright, but a good boy.
I kill'em now? I kill'em now?
no, you just hold them here.
why didn't you say he was your grandson?
you had enough things on your mind.
besides, he must pull his own weight like the rest of us.
I just wanted to make sure he didn't let you down when things got hot.
he did fine.
just fine.
all clear!
from here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.
what's the closest town of any size?
agua Verde.
what's in Agua Verde?
Mexicans, what else?
a headquarters for regulars fighting against Villa.
Mapache territory.
don't we follow?
no, we go back and wait.
we're supposed...
shut up!
why won't you tell your folks to feed them dogs?
won't find very much around here. That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.
I have invited you to my village.
any disrespect to my family or to my people...
...I will kill you.
ashamed of having us meet your people?
Yes. They don't know about my life when I leave the village.
you got a sister?
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance...
...and that of your mama too.
that goes for your grandma too, sonny.
how bad was it?
seven of the villagers were killed. Two of them hung.
our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.
what about the federal troops? Didn't they protect you?
they were federal troops...
...commissioned by the traitor Huerta.
and the soldier who shot my father?
what was his name?
what does it matter? - Your father died like a man.
the names are not important.
how was he called?
mapache.
that is name enough.
in Mexico...
...these are the years of sadness.
but if we had...
...rifles like these...
and Teresa? Did they molest her?
she went with them because she wished to.
she became the woman of Mapache...
...and the others. She went with them, laughing.
drunk with wine and love.
to him, Teresa was a goddess, to be worshipped from afar.
I tell you, she was a mango...
...ripe and waiting.
angel dreams of love and Mapache eats the mango.
that's a good trick.
now I find that hard to believe.
not so hard.
we all dream of being a child again.
even the worst of us.
perhaps the worst most of all.
you know what we are?
Yes, just so, the both of you!
and you!
where is Mapache?!
all right, Pike? All right?
Hey, Tector, let's swap!
come on, let's swap!
you must tell me. Where is Mapache?
why do you wish to know?
for your father?
or the whore?
either you learn to live with it...
...or we'll leave you here.
I go with you.
you know what I'm going to do? Steal his girl.
you are?
here I go.
Dutch, I'm cutting in.
come on, lady!
no gringos.
only federales.
all soldiers...
...no bounty hunters in sight.
now, what the hell is that?
I saw one just like it in Waco.
run on steam?
no, on alcohol or gasoline.
you know what I heard?
I heard they got one of those things up north that can fly.
that was a balloon, you damned old fool.
no, the old man's right. They've got motors and wings, go 60 miles an hour.
going to use them in the war.
let's talk to the General...
...about his automobile and our extra horses.
nice and easy.
probably talking about us behind our backs.
I'm down to about twenty in silver.
since the Generalissimo cleaned out this area, he ought to have a lot.
generalissimo, hell.
he's just another bandit grabbing all he can for himself.
like some others I could mention.
not so as you'd know it.
but we ain't nothing like him. We don't hang nobody.
I hope someday these people kick the scum like him into their graves.
we will.
if it takes forever!
general!
lookie here.
good looking old pony, ain't he?
boy, do you know those beauties?
come on.
she was my woman.
I know.
sure ain't your woman no more.
just look at her licking inside that General's ear.
why did he try to kill His Excellency?
he didn't try to kill His Excellency. He was after the girl.
he went a little crazy when he saw her with you.
are you with the American Army?
no, we're not associated with anybody.
I see.
I was curious about the equipment which you are carrying. That pistol...
...is strictly for the use of army personnel.
it can't be purchased or even owned...
...legally.
is that so?
weapons are my specialty.
I am Commander Frederick Mohr of the Imperial German Army.
it would be very useful for us if we knew of some Americans...
...who did not share their government's naive sentiments.
we share very few sentiments with our government.
he's inviting us for a drink.
good.
good.
shoot him.
bang.
I gave it to him, T. C.
here?
no, no, not there!
wait, what are you going to do?
we got to show a little class here.
right here!
it must be that garrison rail spur.
it's the easiest to hit, but I must find a way to get it out of there.
what do you think?
getting close to home.
look at them gathered around the table.
here we sit like kitchen help.
why do you want us to hit that train?
can't the General take over the whole thing?
general Huerta is anxious to better relations with the U. S...
...not to cross the border and destroy them.
usually these arms shipments are kept pretty secret.
how'd you find out about this?
Mapache has a superb intelligence force organized by my commanding officer.
now, gentlemen...
...we are well organized.
and we'll able to pay 10, 000...
...in gold.
if you're not able to do the work, we'll find someone else.
we can do it. But we're going to need equipment.
do not worry.
our accountant will take care of it.
my General...
...soon you will be the best equipped general in Mexico.
look here...
...ain't he the one.
to the host!
with your permission...
...I need a bath.
with my permission, I think you all need a bath.
I don't!
what me and Tector need is them women you're hogging.
can you fix that up for us?
gentlemen...
...you will excuse me.
I'm sure.
Herrera.
let's get Angel.
I need him.
I'll give you someone much better than that.
if you don't mind, I'll make my own choice.
all right.
he is not important to me.
take him.
I think we'll get the wagon now.
Hey, here come our sweeties.
ain't them pretty?
I don't know about yours, Lyle, but I think...
...I got more than I can handle.
Hey, get out of them...
Hey, you know what they told me?
the dons of Spain built this over 300 years ago.
is that right?
that's right.
I tell you Lyle, I'm all for them dons.
let's have a little target.
she won't get away. Turn her loose.
why not!
Tector, look at them beauties!
how in the hell can you stand it that hot?
I'm going to build me one of these some day and live in it.
hell, Lyle, look here.
come on, sweetheart, let me see your teatsies.
I don't know why the hell I didn't let them kill you.
I'm not going to steal guns for that devil to rob and kill my people again.
noble, noble. Very noble.
I didn't see no tears on your cheeks when you rode in from Starbuck.
they were not my people.
I care about my people, my village.
listen, boy, you ride with us, your village don't count.
if it does, you don't go along.
then I don't go along.
angel, one load of guns ain't going to stop them raiding villages.
think about all the money you'll have.
buy them a ranch. Move them 1, 000 miles.
buy them two or three ranches. - One.
a very small one.
don't you see? This is their land.
and no one will drive them away.
I'll drink to that sentiment.
and to love.
but most of all, I'll drink to gold!
you're a pain in the ass.
would you give guns to someone to kill your father...
...or mother or brother?
ten thousand cuts an awful lot of family ties.
my people have no guns.
but with guns...
...my people could fight.
if I could take guns...
...I would come with you.
how many cases of rifles did Zamora say was in the shipment?
give him one.
all right.
one case and one case of ammo. But you give up your share of the gold.
I will.
we know you will.
we've got that settled.
why, you reprobate!
boys...
they just got engaged.
I'm a son-of-a-bitch!
trot them right in, fellas.
I'm hell on packing mules, but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.
you want to gamble everything on this one shipment being attacked?
if they're in Agua Verde, they'll try for it.
if they are in Agua Verde, they will have seen Mapache.
and who in hell is Mapache?
a killer for Huerta who calls himself a general.
he's been fighting Villa and losing.
but with enough guns, he can become a power in northern Mexico.
pike will try to get them for him.
the train will be guarded with troops.
not regular troops. Green recruits, not worth a damn.
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.
and not this...
...gutter trash you've given me.
what you've got is 24 more days.
never told me how you got all tore up like that.
I met a woman I wanted to marry.
your husband coming back?
no.
he's never coming back.
but you are late.
two days late.
she had a husband.
if I had any sense, I'd have killed him.
he wasn't around.
I got careless.
one night, he walked in on us.
caught her with the first shot, and got me here on the second.
then the coward turned and ran.
ever catch him?
no, but there isn't an hour that passes that I don't think about it.
come on! We've got a long way!
this is our last go around, Dutch.
and selling out a mother who hasn't got a penny. Just like yours!
Teddy... Teddy, I have no problem taking any order you want to give me.
I'll jump off a cliff, if you want.
but you sure as hell better respect this court.
Dan. - This is our government.
I understand what you're saying.
I will pay for the womars groceries out of my own pocket.
it's not about that!
right there.
Jesus.
we buried him in this chapel in the mountains.
and I went down and...
...and I told his mother.
his mother who has cooked meals for me and her son.
and when I told her she... she just looked at me.
and then she went in and she put on her shoes.
and she come out and she said, "Take me to my child."
and we walked for six hours and she didn't say one word.
then we got to the chapel.
and I showed her the grave.
and I'd put a... cross and some flowers on it.
and she turned to me and she said, "I never want to see your face again."
I've crossed the line now, Sinead.
I want time with you, Damien O'Donovan.
I can't feel anything.
in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
right, Ted.
that's all, Father. Thanks.
right.
I'll give the boys a blessing, Finbar.
may our Lord Jesus Christ who sacrificed Himself on the cross for each and every one of you...
...may He grant you the strength and courage to deal with the trials and tribulations that lie before you.
in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
Amen.
congo, in there.
Ned, just on Damiers right.
Finbar, on the far side.
just by... Yeah, on Ned's right.
Auxies, lads! Auxies!
Auxies! - Auxies!
fall out!
cease fire!
Damien. Congo.
cease fire! - Go down and check.
congo, cover Damien.
Dan, Finbar, Vince, Shane, watch the position from here.
Donacha, eyes towards the open road.
are you OK, Teddy? - One man dead! One man dead!
we got one man dead!
what did he say? - One man dead.
who's dead?
Finbar, one man dead!
up here, Damien. - Get the weapons.
it's Gogan. Give me your gun.
he's dead. - He's gone?
what? - He's gone.
he's dead. Gogars dead.
move it. - Come on, wake up.
come on, men, you're soldiers. - Stop looking at them.
you are soldiers! - Move, move, move!
move it, come on! Move it!
he would have killed you!
move! Come on! Fall in! - Form up your columns.
into threes. - In threes.
shoulder your weapon. - Shoulder your weapon!
Sean, buck up, boy! - Into your section.
column, attention!
Hup!
rough business, boys. Filthy job.
now, look again, I'm going to show you something.
look! Look to your right.
look to your right.
mercenaries who were paid to come over to make us crawl and to wipe us out.
here's what we've done. We've sent a message to the British Cabinet that will echo and reverberate around the world.
if they bring their savagery over here, we will meet it with a savagery of our own.
everybody out! Get them out!
go on. Keep going.
get down. Against that wall.
get down on your knees. Get down on your knees!
shit!
have you a round? One round?
we haven't a bullet between us. Stay where you are.
- Oh, shit!
fucking hell just let me go down there!
stay the fuck down! There's nothing we can do. They're dead.
get her arm! - No!
Jesus Christ!
No!
you bastards! Get off me!
stay. No, you stay where you are!
what good are you dead? Stay. You stay where you are.
tell us what we want to know!
- Tell us what we want to know!
you go, you're dead. Stay!
Fenian whore!
look at it burn!
tell us what we want.
tell us! Tell us!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
easy does it.
how's she holding up? - She's very weak still.
well, Bernadette, we'll have to find you somewhere to stay for the next few weeks.
I'm sure the McCan'thys will keep us for a while, Damien.
I'll go over there later on. Mam, we'll go over to McCan'thy's later.
I'm not moving out of this place. - What?
I'm not moving out of this place.
I was four years old, my father died of a famine fever.
sure, I know, Peggy. - And later, I had five children.
and I was evicted. And I am not moving out, unless in the box.
it'll only be for a few weeks.
there's nothing here. The house is gone.
I'll clean out the chicken coop. - Now, don't be talking like that.
clean out the chicken coop? - Yes, I'm cleaning the chicken coop.
where Micheail was murdered? You expect us to live inside there?
I'll clean the chicken coop. - I know, Peggy.
you can't do this to me, Nan! - I'll go and clean the chicken coop.
Jesus Christ, can you not see what they've done to me?
I'm not as strong you, Nan. - Nan, please.
Jesus, Damien, will you take me away from here?
come here. Sinead. Come on. - I can't take it anymore!
I don't want to end up like her! I want to have some kind of a life!
come on. Come on.
Ah, Jesus! - Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
- You're still in shock, do you hear?
it's all gone. - Easy now. Easy now. Easy now.
Sinead.
Teddy O'Donovan?
Teddy O'Donovan?
I've an urgent message for Teddy O'Donovan.
what do you want? - I've a message for him.
what's your name? - Tomas, sir.
what's the message?
I don't know. It just starts with T, that's all I know.
the most important word of the message starts with a T?
Where's the message? - Who gave it to you?
a man down the village. - I think he's lost it.
come on now, where's the message? - Check in your back pockets.
who gave it to you? You lost it? - Take off your jacket.
was it a piece of paper? - Yes.
was it an important message? - Yes. He said it was very important.
he had a message but he's lost it.
I don't have time for this.
did you come down or up the hill? - Down the hill.
see if you can find it. Thick for dropping the message, was it?
hold up, I have it. I have it. I have it.
a truce has been declared. Hostilities cease from midnight.
God bless you all. Finbar. - Truce?
what? - A truce has been declared.
a truce has been declared. - Give us a look.
hostilities cease from midnight. God bless you all. Finbar.
you're joking! - Jesus Christ!
is that right?
it's a truce, lads. - Is that right?
a truce has been declared.
it is Finbar's writing? - It is, yeah.
God bless you all. Finbar. - Jesus!
what is it? - A truce.
Yes! Yes!
sinn Fein and Government Delegates meet and everybody hopes for a happy settlement.
success! British and Irish leaders sign Peace Treaty.
the Agreement will establish a new Irish Free State.
it will have full control of customs, tariffs and economic policy.
that's it, boy.
the Irish Delegates who signed the treaty...
the new state will remain within the British Empire as a dominion.
as a dominion?
members of the new Parliament will swear an oath of allegiance to...
you see this?
splendid news says the King!
what kind of peace can you have with a king?
they're in the wrong.
I don't have any fecking king. - Feck off!
what? No way! No way!
is this what we fought for, is it? Is this what we fought for, is it?
a betrayal of 1916.
look at this, boy. It's all true.
Lmmediate and terrible war.
those were the exact words.
the threat promised by the British Cabinet if we didn't ratify this treaty.
Lloyd George, Churchill, Chamberlain, Birkenead, Hamar Greenwood.
a bunch of more vicious bastards in the one room you can't imagine.
they have just watched 17 million men, women and children die in the Great War.
you think they'll give a damn about a few thousand dead Republicans?
bluffing. They're in a dirty war and they can't win.
Oh, I see. Fair enough. - I agree.
they're not going to lose face in America. And the rest of the world.
they're not going to risk that. - It's costing them $10, 000 a day.
they've a lot more after that don't you worry.
lads, you're not hearing what Teddy's saying.
Lmmediate and terrible war." Think about it.
we've 3, 500 rifles in the country. How's that going to work for us? Huh?
lads, we have freedom within our grasp.
we're that close. It's just one inch but it's still out of reach.
and if we stop now, we will never again... regain the power that I can feel in this room. I can sense it in this room today.
and if we stop short now, never in our lifetime will we see that energy again. Ever!
so I'm begging each and every one of you to just go that inch.
we cannot stop until we've complete freedom from Britain!
remember this? Remember this?
each one of us swore an oath of allegiance to the Irish Parliament of 1919. This treaty flies in the face of it.
it insults it by asking us to swear another oath to the King that we're trying to get out. An oath!
and maybe if I was a politician, like yourselves,
I could say whatever I want, but I'm not.
I'm a Republican. And the only question I want you to answer is, are you men of your word?
do you expect me to answer that?
are you a Republican? - Of course I'm a Republican!
I need to say something in answer. - Bloody liar.
absent faces.
but they're still present in here.
it's Kevin, Johnny, Colum, murdered in the barracks.
there's Benny, shot in the back while cutting turf.
Aidan, tortured and then hung.
Micheail.
Jesus, I could go on all day, but we can't forget Micheail.
he was beaten to a pulp in front of his mother.
and I cannot, I will not...
...spit on the graves of our dead martyrs by swearing an oath of allegiance to the British Crown!
if you really want to desecrate the graves of those boys, if you want to insult their memories, you go ahead and reject this treaty.
because this is what they died for.
and because a lot of you are too stubborn!
you're too stubborn! You're too stubborn to...
talk about Michael Collins. Michael Collins is a hero.
he went down there to London. He was seduced by the wining and dining.
he did not negotiate a proper treaty. - Bloody surrender.
more of a surrender than what the British are doing?
think of the concessions they've made.
Lloyd George is in a coalition with die-hard Tories.
as far as they're concerned,
ireland is this tiny dot in a much bigger picture.
do you seriously think they'd let him give the green light to nationalists in India and in Africa and the whole fucking empire by giving us complete independence?
it was never going to happen that way, and you all know it.
if we ratify this treaty, we will destroy the two most precious gifts that we won with this last election.
one, being a mandate for complete freedom, not a compromised freedom.
the second, being a Democratic programme in which is enshrined the priority, the public welfare over private welfare.
this treaty will copper-fasten the hold of the powerful over the poor because there will be a governor general who'll have our puppet parliament on a leash. It'll be business as usual, with workers tied to a shift at a factory and fellas begging for jobs.
it's the partition of the country. The alienation, the abandonment of our brothers in the top of this country.
you say the Brits are leaving? They're going 300 miles up the road.
men, women and children being burned out of their homes.
it's true, boy. It's true.
my cousins are on the streets of Belfast.
burned from their homes by Loyalists. There's refugees all over Dublin.
you know what this treaty means for them?
instead of sectarian gangs, they'll now face those same thugs armed and uniformed by the British state.
- Read the treaty, Sinead.
there's no certainty. We'll have a divided Ireland.
there is certainty. Read the treaty. Read the treaty. There is certainty.
Dan?
my dad was a navvy. He worked in London, digging holes for tuppence ha'penny until it killed him.
I had two sisters I never got to know because they died in infancy for want of a doctor.
now, what I signed up to, when I got involved in this, was part... Here.
I have a piece of paper here.
it's from the Democratic Programme of the First Dail.
it's a short quote. I won't keep you. I'm going to read this out to you.
the natiors sovereignty extends not only to all the men and women of the nation, but to all its material possessions, the natiors soil and all its resources. All the wealth, and all the wealth-producing processes within the nation.
that means, all of us in this country own every bit of this country.
and that's what we all signed up to when we voted for the Dail. Right?
if we pursue this, every child in this country will have an equal chance.
if we don't, they won't have a chance in hell.
if we ratify this treaty, all we're changing is the accents of the powerful and the colour of the flag.
that's not true! That's not true!
thanks be to God, it was a great day to see the back of them.
Jesus Christ, I thought I'd never see the day.
you can say that again. - Not before time.
exactly.
good riddance to them.
one-way ticket now, lads. Have a safe journey and God bless all of you.
bugger off, Paddy! - And I'll see you in hell.
eyes to your front, soldier!
look at them. Not a gun between them.
handed them all over to the freestaters.
Jesus Christ. They're on their way. Is that not good enough for you?
here, look at the gombeen-men. Licking their lips already, Damien.
decent men.
Oh, are they? - Yeah, they are.
it's Teddy in the freestate uniform. - What?
Teddy's wearing the bloody freestate uniform.
kick out the Black and Tans, bring in the Green and Tans.
bastards, the lot of you.
you won't even give us a chance. This treaty's been approved by the Dail.
Hasrt been approved in the field.
Hasrt been approved in here, boy.
any of you for a drink? - Yeah, go on.
how are you, boy? - Lads.
we're back at work again. I have to go to Dublin.
the Republican Army leaders have summoned an emergency meeting.
seven out of ten volunteers out against the treaty.
these freestate ladeens up here are recruiting left, right and centre.
ex-British army, all sorts.
is it true they're bringing in weapons from England?
there's all sorts of rumours. We're setting up a new HQ in Dublin.
I need the pair of you and I need Rory to keep the training going.
I'll be in touch when I can. - Alright.
what if they try to take our guns?
over my dead body will we give up a single bullet.
you have to keep down.
keep your backsides down. - Tuck it into your elbows.
keep your arse down. - Get the muzzle up out of there.
you'll smash that rifle.
the butt of your rifle is facing away from you.
come on, boy, keep the line. Come on.
keep the line, lads. Don't be rushing ahead.
my grandmother could do better.
you're falling behind again, you dozy bollox. Move forward.
look down the line. There isn't one.
your muzzle's going straight into the dirt.
right, next line.
don't be last in line.
on the double means run. Come on!
form the line.
down on your bellies.
rifles as we told you.
you know where you're going. You don't have to look.
your dozy face makes a great target. Now put your head down!
are you the doctor? Are you the doctor? I need a doctor.
I'm a doctor. - I've a sick child. Can you see him?
in to your left. - Thank you.
well, now. Hello.
what's your name? - Diarmuid.
can I have a little look at your eyes? There's a good man.
good boy. Can you stick out your tongue for me? Now say, "Aaah."
Aaah. - Good fella.
right. Will you sit up? I want to have a look at your tummy.
take that off.
good man. Now, lie back down for me.
will he be alright, Doctor?
he will. He'll be fine. Good boy.
good man.
would you like a glass of water? - I won't. I'm fine.
maybe a drop for himself. - Right.
up you get now.
are they your sisters outside? - Yeah.
what are their names? - Aoife, Sheila and Emer.
Aoife, Sheila and Emer.
how is he?
he's half-starved, Dan.
Jesus!
there's two piles of 30 there, alright? Double-check 'em.
alright.
who's doing the stall on Saturday? - Huh?
the stall. - I'm not doing any stall.
what? - Feck off. Ask Lily to do the stall.
I can't do the stall. You'll have to do it.
er, I can't.
one thing I don't understand, why do you always put Labour above the Republic?
telegram from Dublin.
Finbar was in the Four Courts with the Republican leaders.
Freestaters smashed the place with 18-pounders from the British.
for fuck's sake. - Bastards!
Sinead, was there anyone killed? - I've no details, Lily.
but Finbar wants us to hit back down here immediately.
I'm not hitting back.
where you off to there, Ned? - I'm sorry, lads.
I've had enough. - That's an order from Finbar.
tell that to the bastards killing Republicans in the Four Courts!
where are you going, boy?
the longer I stay here, the more mers lives are in danger. Come on.
Rory, what's this going to achieve? Ned?
we've received our orders, alright? - Jesus Christ.
sorry, lads. I'm not hitting back.
there are men in the Four Courts. Our comrades are up there.
Damien. I'm with you all the way, but... I'm with you all the way, but these are our own lads.
no, our comrades are in the Four Courts. They're our comrades.
this won't stop in the Four Courts. - It's over for me.
just hang on, will you?
Jesus Christ.
right, you bastards.
put it down! Put it down!
Rory! Rory, stand your men down. Rory, stand your men down.
shut your hole! - Frighten the ladies.
shut your hole! - Stand down.
grab their guns. How many?
fucking turncoats!
put it down. Put it down!
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
shut up! I've a good mind to do you all.
come on, hurry up, move it!
you've killed two fellow Irishmen!
tell that to the boys in the Four Courts! Come on, move it.
what's it like to kill an Irishman? - Shut your hole!
come on, move it. Come on.
bloody Rory, he's insane. Some bastards are beyond reason.
self-righteous Rory, with his big thick head on him.
he's quite content being the underdog, you do know that?
I do indeed. - Jesus.
the military courts will show them. - It's not enough.
what are you saying?
if they take one out, we take one back. To hell with the courts.
Jesus, Teddy, they're still our boys out there.
they're confused. They'll run out of steam.
some will. Some will fight to the end.
I agree. We've got to stamp it out.
if we don't stop them, the Brits will be back.
after all we've achieved, after everything we've been through, we can't go back to that.
I never thought I'd see the day.
military courts established in Ireland by Irishmen.
deportation or the death penalty for those caught with arms.
in the name of God, what is going on?
I found this on the street during the week.
under the Republic, the lands of the aristocracy who live in London will be seized and divided up against landless workers and small farmers.
all industry and agriculture will be controlled by the state for the workers' and farmers' benefit.
not content with stealing your savings, they'll be nationalising the 12 apostles next.
dear brethren, we have an opportunity for the first time in generations in this country for peace and prosperity.
we have that opportunity without English soldiers marching in our streets and outside our churches on a Sunday morning.
we have that opportunity because we have signed a treaty.
a treaty of peace.
quiet!
let me remind those of you who have forgotten of the pastoral letter signed by Cardinal Logue and other bishops.
Anti-Treatyite irregulars have, and I quote, "Wrecked Ireland from end to end."
and all those who participate in such crimes are guilty of the gravest sins and may not be absolved in confession nor admitted to Holy Communion.
in other words, excommunication!
this opinion of the treaty is not just the opinion of the Catholic Church, it is the opinion of other churches.
and it is the opinion of every newspaper up and down, and the length and breadth of this country.
