did you ever ask him about this?
no. I thought he was nervous.
because the wedding-- I thought men need their space.
I never asked.
I thought men need their space.
who is that?
who the hell is that?
the squashed guy.
crushed. Crushed guy.
been in the car for about a day, dead, before the crusher got him.
we got a positive I. D.off dental records.
so crushed guy, weeks before his wedding, decides to go into the garage and do a little online thing with...
according to these I.M.S he saved, a girl who calls herself Bethany.
they met in a chat room.
strangers seeking strangers.
what's with the nudie pics?
they were playing a game.
she sent him a piece of herself each time he did something for her.
something? Like what something?
why in heaven's name would you want to do this by yourself?
I'm not saying you would want to do this at all, but if you were to do this, why would you do it by yourself--am I right?
he didn't think he was by himself. He thought he was with her.
well, let me tell you something, there is no her.
and there is no Bethany, okay?
there is a 13-year-old member of the marching band with an online account and a social disorder.
you played the... - trombone. And I was good.
let's look for a suspect in the real world, shall we?
what about the girl? Did she know what Mikey was up to?
didn't look like it.
engaged for about a month.
she was spending the night at her sister's.
why would you want to be with that fat cowboy?
fat cowboy?
if that's what he told you he looks like, it's not true.
he's not slim. He's not athletic.
he doesn't have blue eyes or blond hair.
he's lying to you, Bethany.
I think we need to go back to the wrecking yard.
you wanna know what he really looks like?
he must weigh 300 pounds. Mud-brown eyes.
he's balding under that hat.
he's not tall, and he's ugly.
why would you want to be with that, Bethany?
why would you want to be with someone like...
why don't you stand away from the desk for us?
Hey, Rob, if that's Bethany, tell her I say hello, okay?
he's on me.
Reese? - Crews, get him off.
get him off of me! He's on me!
how 'bout you get off my partner?
okay, uh, first day... no pRoblem.
nobody shows up, I'll deal with it. Every rejection is a step forward.
just get to "yes."
wow, this is... quite the turnout.
this is the right classroom?
"a practical introduction to effective business practices"? Yes?
great. Uh, good morning.
my name is Ted Earley.
as in the early bird, but...
with an "e..."
between...
l" and the...
the "Y.
okay, we've got a long way to go, so let's start with a simple question.
what is business?
uh, yes, miss.
is this class gonna be graded or pass/fail?
Oh, uh, graded.
so, what... is...
what's business?
the answer is everything.
everything is business.
every historical event, every war.
every decision made by every government.
any book stocked or sold.
from the moment that Eve first decided to accept delivery of that apple from that snake, we have been engaged in...
business.
I don't like getting sat on, Rob.
she doesn't.
you know, you did a good job trashing your computer.
but we got guys in the basement, all they do is pull stuff off computers.
pulled some pretty good stuff off of yours.
you know, you'd pRobably like a job like that.
down there in the dark, just you and a computer.
wanna talk about Bethany?
please don't say her name. - Why not? It's a pretty name.
it's not for you to speak it.
what about Mike? Could he speak it?
we got Mike's computer.
Mike and Bethany were going at it pretty hard.
stuff that made my partner blush.
stuff I've never even heard of.
you and Bethany, though, from what we read, didn't really get into that.
seems like you and Bethany were just friends, though. Right, Rob?
I've got guys in my life like that. Just friends kinda guys.
it's a little sad.
she sent you stuff like,"if you saw me, would you know me"?
I look for you wherever I go.
it's nice, I guess.
not like the stuff she sent Mike.
Bethany never sent you anything like this, did she?
it's okay, Rob. You can look.
Hey, Rob...
I know you've got a secret. Won't you share it with me?
the secret you and Bethany were I. M.ing when we walked in?
I'll read your part, Rob.
you don't have to worry about what happened.
what happened, Rob?
it's your secret, Bethany.
now it's mine. No one else will know.
are you covering for Bethany?
because that's what we call being an accomplice to murder.
just tell me one thing.
tell me that you love me.
my partner will read this part.
I-- - you shut up.
you do not say those words.
that is not for you to say.
Bethany was sending Mike pictures like this, and not you?
never you, and still you're gonna defend her?
strangers seeking strangers.
you met her there first. Then what?
you brag to Mike, Mike goes online, then takes her away?
Mike Brody got up in her head.
he confused her.
he could do that, but she figured it out.
she figured him out completely.
what happened that night, Rob?
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
you find who was on the other end of these I. M.S, you find this Bethany.
then you go through the looking glass and you bring 'em back here.
we already talked to the geeks in sex crimes.
they said it would take a few days, low priority.
well, hold him until you get that trace.
on what charge?
on the charge of freakin' me the hell out.
we have everything we need to find Bethany right here.
if we need to figure out where Bethany is, we need to figure out who Bethany is.
and who Bethany is is in here.
well, Bethany is not gonna be that.
no, maybe not. But Bethany is in there. We just gotta find her.
what are we looking for?
anything that seems real.
anything that's mentioned more than once.
tennis.
got it. - got it.
ocean breezes. - Got it.
wait, wait... uh, no, no. Ocean breezes.
junior in college? - Yep.
you got this?
no, I'm pretty sure I don't.
is it funny every time?
I think it might be.
went to school in L. A.
wanted to stay close to home.
was on campus, but living at home now.
played two years for my school.
played two years until I had to stop.
living at home now.
played two years until I had to stop.
until I had to stop.
until I had to stop.
she's from L. A. Went to schools in L. A.
check the tennis squads of all the local colleges.
go back a few years. - got a listing for a Bethany.
got a home address.
can I help you?
we're looking for Bethany.
you found her.
through the looking glass.
enjoying your job?
I am just a humble public servant.
Oh, you're the police.
we need to ask you some questions.
mom, the police are here.
you want some lemonade?
mom! The police are here!
she'll be right down.
I told 'em about all the coke and hookers in the pool house.
sm soorry about that.
Hi, I'm detective Crews. This is detective Reese.
are you here-- is this about my daughter?
Yes, we'd like to talk to you about
I'm sorry. Here.
my husband. He handles these things.
put the phone anywhere when you're done.
what just happened?
I was just about to ask you the same thing.
I hear... music.
it's a new cd we have coming out next week.
it's nice, isn't it?
so now, detective, maybe you can tell me why you were at my house.
Mr. Gray, we have reason to believe your daughter Bethany might have been involved in a murder.
involved?
involved exactly how?
there was an online relationship. Two online relationships, in fact.
online? So you don't know who it is, do you?
we know it ended up like this.
not exactly the kind of picture you're used to, Mr. Gray.
you have no idea what I'm used to, detective.
there's another man involved: Rob Dow.
both were tow truck drivers.
they're tow truck drivers?
my Bethany would never be involved with tow truck drivers.
Mr. Gray, when we showed up at your house, your wife wanted to know if it might be about your daughter.
has Bethany been in trouble before?
she's not in trouble now.
my Bethany is a good girl. She lives at home.
sounds to me like you're looking for a bad girl.
you know, I know bad girls. In my business...
Oh, I know a lot of bad girls.
my Bethany isnon e of 'em.
I know bad girls.
Yeah, I'll bet he knows bad girls.
do men have to be disgusting?
I mean, isn't there, like, an operation you guys can get?
I think they're working on a pill.
what did those transcripts say about where Bethany lived?
Uh,"was on campus, living at home now.
what about the tennis?
played two years, and then I had to leave.
let's go see why Bethany left school.
maybe she's not such a good girl.
Bethany's name is listed on the lease here, but she lives at home?
we split the rent here before her dad pulled her out of school.
do you know her dad knows Bono?
why did her dad pull her out of school?
because of what happened with her professor.
his wife kinda walked in, and they were kinda on his desk?
stop.
she's got problems.
what kind of problems?
her dad.
he's always telling her stuff he shouldn't.
what kind of stuff?
like what a tough guy he is.
the groupies he used to bang.
and what happened to the professor?
he walks with a cane now.
Nathan Gray-- born Nathan Gratowitz.
a few possessions, convictions, some assault beefs.
now he runs Gray Scale music.
now he's all clean.
his daughter Bethany has got a little Jacket too.
DUIs, driver's license suspended, probation.
and then last year she goes off and has an affair with her humanities professor.
what kind of an affair?
online and in bed.
when Nathan reads the emails between his daughter and her teacher, he takes Bethany's computer away, he takes a bat to the teacher's knees.
paid him to drop the charges.
if Bethany's back online and her father finds out...
wow, there really is a Bethany.
I've gotta rethink a lot of things. Press Nathan.
excuse me. Excuse me!
Oh, detective.
you know, I thought you might come back.
what, you took a look at my jacket and thought you'd like another poke at Nathan?
well, if you want to talk to me, you go through them.
bodyguards? - Lawyers.
he does that.
studying for your orals?
when was this taken? - Last year.
she was so messed up.
an athlete blasted all the time.
it was all over the web.
her dad based a cd cover on it.
Yeah. Messed up.
even if he does know Bono.
you could have just sent the key.
not everything in there is yours.
why, you don't trust me?
I didn't know what to do with it, us I just kept it.
thank you.
hard to believe everything we had fit into this tiny space.
well, not everything.
Hey, there's my drunken clown.
there they are.
I've been looking for these.
I got a new case today.
some record producer guy.
got me thinking about my old albums.
got me thinking about a lot of things.
Yeah, I remember that. - What?
you used to talk to me about the job when you came home.
sorry.
it's okay.
and not all of these albums are yours.
this one was mine. And this one.
and that one was yours.
that was not mine. I would never listen to that.
not only did you listen to it, but you listened to it over and over again.
that's our bed.
yes... it is.
but, uh... we're not gonna think about that.
no?
we're not gonna think about that.
we're not gonna think about me kissing you.
no...
we're not gonna think about you kissing me.
we're not gonna think about me... touching you.
no. We're not gonna think about you...
touching me.
I'm not thinking about it.
neither am I.
lock up when you're done.
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
how about a drink?
one, that's inappropriate. - Why?
because you're my boss. And two...
if you read my file, you'd see that I was in the program.
why would I read your file?
because you're my boss.
I don't like files. Too wordy.
come on. So we'll get a fake beer. Huh?
and maybe we'll get fake drunk and end up having fake drunk sex, what do you say?
I'd say that idea's repulsive.
those are the very first words each of my three wives spoke to me.
and they all changed their minds.
it's twisted.
he gets some model to play his daughter on an album cover.
it'll make me buy it, but it's well and truly twisted.
we've been looking for someone obsessive and violent.
you want to go see Nathan.
Nathan's all lawyered up.
then let's go see Nathan's girls.
okay, so, Maya, why are you in this class?
I'm taking every class.
you're taking every class in the business school?
by the time I graduate, I'll have done exactly that. Yes, sir.
O--okay. What about you... Vairam?
I have a top secret business plan.
are--are you gonna be working on it in the class?
Yes.
great, well, why don't we discuss
I will not discuss my business.
it is a secret business. Move on.
uh, well, that just leaves you, Ed.
I'd like to learn how to do that thing where if somebody tells you it's in the constitution that you don't have to pay taxes, then you don't have to pay taxes.
that's not in the constitution.
Wesley Snipes did it.
Yeah.
I'm on my way out. - Nice car.
Bethany, you ever see what happens when a car goes through the crusher?
ever see what happens when a man goes through the crusher?
it kind of looks like strawberry jelly or lasagna.
or strawberry jelly an d lasagna.
is that supposed to shock me?
I've seen it before. Plenty of times.
it's not you, but it's you.
like I said, I'm on my way out.
I'll go with you.
Yeah, okay. Whatever.
come on.
good. All right.
you used to be a singer?
looked you up.
you know, you had that one album out, and then nothing.
it's how you and your husband met, though, right? In the recording studio?
Hey, how come you stopped singing after you got married?
Nathan didn't like it?
I stopped singing because I wanted to.
to raise my daughter.
Ah, Bethany, yeah. Lovely girl. Strong swing.
Bethany, did you go online to get away from your father?
I wasn't online. It wasn't me.
I stopped drinking. I stopped doing that.
I'm in the real world now.
if it wasn't you online, then the person we're looking for is not you.
any idea who's not you, Bethany?
that could be anyone.
well, the things they knew about you, I--I think it's closer to home.
maybe you want to ease up a little.
you spend a lot of time with these kids?
Yes. They need me.
nothing wrong with being needed, is there?
what about computers, Lynn?
can you think of anybody who would need one of those?
you're saying someone out there is pretending to be me?
someone I know. And because of that...
someone is dead.
you know, I tried to be good.
I came home. I left that world.
I'm in the real world now.
I am. I am.
you are? Okay, yes, you are!
you know your husband is prone to violence.
and his relationship with your daughter?
I mean, if he thought Bethany was online again
Nathan was with me. Our club dance.
I really have to get back to work.
you miss it? Singing?
I never even think about it.
someone close to me.
someone who knows me, out there pretending to be me. Someone like
Bethany, slow down.
maybe you can drive now.
Reese, how'd it go?
my guess, both of Nathan's girls are gonna take a hard look at daddy.
why do you need a ride?
did you lose another car?
crews.
detective Crews? She's speaking.
excuse me?
Rachel. She is speaking.
Hello, Jack.
how come every time you come around somebody ends up getting hurt?
what are you doing here, Jack?
he came to say good-bye.
so now you're the one not talking?
you take care of yourself, kid.
you know where she is, but you didn't tell 'em?
how come you didn't tell 'em where she is, Jack?
you've been protecting her from them?
I've always been protecting her.
you've gotten in too deep, haven't you, Jack?
maybe I can help you get out.
not for nothing, Jack.
it was six. It is five.
but it could just as easily be four.
who set me up, Jack?
Yeah, okay.
I'm a lot of things, detective Crews, but I'm no rat.
who are they, Jack?
I do want to thank you for finding the man that killed that girl's family.
for putting him away.
but ever since you got out of jail, Crews, all I've been doing is cleaning up your mess.
but it's your mess. So you can clean it up.
since you talked to my mother, she hasn't stopped crying.
why is she crying, Bethany?
because there were two hours at that party where my mother couldn't find my father.
she's so scared.
Nathan has no alibi.
let's go pick him up.
did my father kill that man?
I just googled you.
you were in jail. You looted pension funds.
I wouldn't put it like that.
how would you put it?
yeah... I did things I'm not proud of.
and I did my time.
but before all of that, I was a good businessman, and I made a lot of money for a lot of people.
so you're saying what you did was okay?
no. No.
what I'm saying is that business is a system, and I know how it works.
and if any of you would like to learn how it works, then you will pick up your pencils right now or get the hell out of my classroom.
we have computers, not pencils.
there was no mention of pencils.
will we be needing pencils?
gimme a minute?
Mrs. Dunn, you want to see me?
he wasn't cleaning his gun, detective Crews.
but it wasn't the other, was it?
Jimmy swore he would never leave me.
I don't see how it could have been.
his name is Mickey Raybourn.
I don't know these other men, but this one...
you got a temper, Nate.
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
makes me real good at my job.
real good in other places too.
don't talk to me like I'm one of the groupies you used to bang.
used to. Not anymore.
you're a family man now, right, nate?
got a wife and a daughter.
are you out there online pretending you're something you're not, Nathan?
is that how you get off now, Nathan?
no, I don't need to do that.
you don't? - No.
if I need that thing, I need to taste it, I need to touch it.
you know, I need to feel the skin, the flesh.
I don't need to pretend to be somebody, sweetheart.
when you're with Nathan, you're with Nathan.
may I see my lawyers now, please?
Where's your partner?
she said something about going to take a shower to wash Nathan off.
he's got no alibi, but we got no witness, no weapon, no confession.
rob dow still has a secret.
and now it's time for him to tell us.
yeah? How you gonna do that?
freakshow actually seems to enjoy lockup.
he does seem to enjoy it, doesn't he?
the question is why?
look at him, he looks like he's gonna be rewarded for keeping that secret.
rob Dow isn't sharing his secret with us, but he's waiting for someone to share it with.
if we want Rob dow to share the secret...
are you thinking about what I'm thinking about?
about Reese in the shower? No.
how come no one out here treats me like a commanding officer?
we do.
and as my commanding officer, I'm thinking I need you to let me sign someone out of lockup.
this is it, Rob.
she's here.
here in the same room as you.
breathing the same air as you.
it's real.
anything you want to say, now's your chance.
you said you wanted to talk to me?
I don't want you to worry.
I'm gonna take care of everything, okay? - Stop talking.
Bethany, is there anything that you want to say to me now?
what would I want to say to you?
what you wrote to me all those times.
I don't know you.
but I saw you.
that wasn't me.
I was here tuesday night.
Mike's phone rang.
I heard him say your name, Bethany.
he went outside, and then I saw you.
I stood at the window. I couldn't even breathe.
I saw you hit him with the racket.
you hit him so hard that it broke.
I tried to clean it all up out there in the dark.
I will help you with this.
all you have to do is just say that you love me, and I will take it all back.
if you saw me, would you know me?
I look for you wherever I go.
Bethany, when we go back to your house, will we find a broken tennis racket?
that was in the emails off Rob's computer.
Bethany sent it to Rob.
Bethany wasn't born when this picture was taken.
you looked a lot like your daughter back then.
probably still do in the right light.
the party at your club...
you and Nathan took separate cars.
he was coming from work.
Mrs. Gray, is that a new tennis racket?
there are uniforms searching your house right now.
they're gonna find your old racket, aren't they?
the one you hit Mike Brody with.
when we brought Bethany back from school, after all her troubles,
I was the one to close her computer accounts.
I took one look.
I wanted to see what she'd been doing.
I just took one look.
what did you see? - I saw a whole world in there.
there's a whole world out here.
not for me.
see, I used to be Bethany.
but I'm not Bethany anymore.
but in there...
I was Bethany again.
Mike loved me.
online, on the phone.
I went to see him dressed just like this.
I thought that's what he wanted.
but when he saw me...
he just laughed.
I didn't mean to kill him.
it's just that he laughed.
he said I wasn't Bethany.
don't ever grow old.
you're not old.
I am.
is that Mark Rawls over there?
you know Mark Rawls, don't you, Arthur?
you told his son you could get him out of jail.
and then you killed him.
send me somewhere now, and i'll talk.
start talking now.
I killed the kid.
the thing about Olivia, Charlie, is...
she's marrying your father.
she seems really nice. Really.
chasing through the world brings only chaos.
allowing it to come to be brings only peace.
retreat from the world, and it shall pursue you.
to exist, to allow the world to exist, all things at once, all things as one.
this is the path to surrender, to balance.
see yourself as part of the world...
you having a moment?
I know every moment is now, but now we're ten minutes late.
did you feel that?
does someone always have to say that?
I'm standing right next to you. Yes. I felt that.
it was an earthquake. - it was a tremor.
did you feel that?
all right, here's the latest. Four freeways cut. 50 fires.
power grids and water services out city-wide.
busted water mains. Dorm collapse at L. A.U.
now, according to this lapd emergency manual, county emergency operation center will be calling us with our emergency assignments.
so buckle up. It's an emergency.
he's reading with his foot.
no, he's just using it to turn the pages.
it must be his first earthquake.
detective Crews.
officer Danny ritenour, state corrections office. We're having a little emergency.
yeah? Us too.
Yeah, well, that earthquake just facilitated the escape of a prisoner that you put away last year, one Arthur Tins.
what happened?
he was on a work detail when the earthquake hit, and Tins got away.
he's in Los Angeles?
the mother of the kids Tins killed
I do have her address, and we will notify her.
good. She testified in the penalty phase of Tins's trial.
now, is there anyone else he'd wanna even things up with?
cause we have to contact these people.
uh, no. Tins confessed. No one gave him up. The victim's dead.
okay. We're just trying to cover every angle. Thank you.
Hey, have we spoken before?
I don't think so.
you have any connection to the corrections department?
no, sir. Not anymore.
good luck today.
Yeah, okay.
should we tell him that's not a weight-bearing wall and it won't do him any good?
Arthur Tins is not gonna go after anyone.
that weasel's gonna find a rock to hide under and stay hidden.
it's not a question of who Arthur Tins is gonna go after.
it's a question of who's gonna go after Arthur Tins.
paroled out three months ago.
I don't think I like what you're saying.
I don't think I like what I'm saying either.
you're saying we have to stop Arthur Tins from getting killed?
Yeah. I guess we do.
Yeah. I guess we do.
Yeah, I guess you don't.
since when do you go by the book?
you don't even have a regulation haircut.
I go by the book.
I go by this book, the lapd emergency manual, since about an hour ago when the earth opened up and tried to swallow Los Angeles whole.
besides, we have a lot of things to do today.
and none of them are stopping crimes that haven't happened yet.
Oh, god, this is it! Hold on, everyone! It's the big one!
that's funny. Real funny.
okay. No mug shots. Sorry, lapd computers are down.
Arthur Tins. Low rent scam artist.
last year, he killed the 10-year-old son of Mark Rawls.
mark Rawls happened to be doing ten years inside at the time.
Arthur Tins confesses to killing Mark Rawls's 10-year-old son.
he gets life.
Yeah, I heard about that confession.
I heard Tins wasn't talking, and then I heard two lapd detectives that look a lot like you two took Tins to go see rawls in the joint he was doing his time in.
tins took one look at the hard case rawls and sang like a bird.
is that what you heard? - That's what I heard.
rawls got paroled three months ago.
tins escaped this morning, so now they are both out there
LAPD computers are down.
the prison grapevine is not.
and by tonight, Arthur Tins is gonna be dead.
Ooh, two psychos killing each other. You know what that is?
that's a civic improvement project, okay?
like I said before, we're not the future crimes unit, and we all have our assignments out there
even your very own tidwell.
Oh, well, how is tidwell gonna get his assignment out there if tidwell can't leave his doorway?
tidwell is working on it.
and as for you two, today... You're on foot patrol.
hold on!
did you feel that?
tidwell said foot patrol.
we just happen to be patrolling the street where Mark Rawls lives.
how do you get over something like that?
someone like Tins killing your son?
you sit in your cell every day, think about what you'd do to Tins if you ever got the chance.
and that gets you over it?
call for backup. We're gonna take rawls in when we see him.
maybe you should, uh... Button up a little.
button up?
you know, we're goin' into a building full of violent ex-offenders.
you ever see the cartoon where the wolf is staring at the lamb, but what he really sees is lamb chops?
lamb chops.
always a pleasure to see you.
you want some mint jelly with that?
as you can see, I'm doing all right.
nothing structural.
I'd think there'd be a lot of people out there needing your help.
like Arthur Tins?
Oh, Arthur Tins is a guest of the great state of california.
what kind of help could he possibly be needing, detective?
tins escaped. This morning.
he's out.
no. Not angry enough. Try again. - What?
we come here to tell you the man who killed your son has escaped from prison, and you go with, "he's out.
you're lying to us.
how were you planning on spending your day today, Mark?
I did you a favor.
now you do me one and walk away from all this.
okay. I'll do you a favor.
my partner's gonna take her gun out for this next part.
you know the drill.
you should walk away.
he put a bullet in my son.
it's my job on the street to die. You should walk away.
Yeah.
california penal code 12021 is a person who has been convicted of
he killed my son! What would you do, huh?
no killing today, all right, Mark?
why not?
all right, central's not processing new prisoners 'cause of the quake.
so book him in valley division and forward me the paperwork.
we have an assignment to get back to.
I guess you really are a cop. - I guess I am.
you had to do it.
doesn't mean I have to like it.
Oh, come on. Go direct traffic... It'll make you feel better.
it's Tins!
is he okay?
what are you thinkin'?
I'm thinking that when I woke up today I wasn't thinking that I'd have to kill somebody.
now you think you have to?
no. Now I think I want to.
okay, see, as your commanding officer, I hear something like that, I have to take your weapon.
so it's a good thing I didn't hear that.
when did Tins get so smart?
prison gives you a lot of time for self-improvement.
Yeah, prison.
you go in afraid of your own shadow, and you come out a full-blown psycho.
they all come out worse than they went in.
well, maybe not everyone.
Yeah, but how did Tins find us?
location status check. D-247, 400 block. Alvarado street.
our call for backup.
tins heard it off the radio. We told him where rawls was.
we thought we were trailing him, he was trailing us.
wait a minute.
how'd he even know you were gonna go see rawls in the first place?
state corrections didn't even know Tins escaped until ten minutes ago.
well, if they didn't know Tins escaped, then who called us this morning?
tins. - Must have been.
he called to tell us so we'd lead him to rawls.
no Tins, but we found his state prison jumpsuit.
it was stuffed in the garbage can downstairs.
so he's still dressed like a cop.
perfect disguise, especially with the city going to hell.
this is it? No more clothes?
no. Why?
because Tins wasn't alone.
corrections says he escaped from that work detail with two other men
a leonard Crete Debs and a Donnie Wayne Johnson.
when did this get here?
thanks for making me the man I am. Arthur Tins.
so now he's out there somewhere with these two knuckleheads.
any thoughts as to where out there?
known associates from his file?
problem is, all closed case files are computerized now.
Yeah, and what with the quake, the police computers are still down.
what about a living file? Wasn't Tins married?
ex-wives are a beautiful thing, but how are we gonna find her?
if only we had a really big book that listed everybody's names, addresses, and phone numbers.
dude, you are old-school. I'll roust one up.
Charlie! Yeah-- yes. Oh, yes, I-I-I sure did. Yeah.
Yeah, it was quite something. Listen, I-I need to ask for
no. Y-you know what? No, never mind. It's--it's fine.
I-I was really just calling to see how you were.
Yes. I'm fine. Yeah, yeah.
just... Have a pencil in my hand.
it's ted. Yeah. Yeah. How are you?
Oh, I sure did feel it over here. Yes!
problem, uh... Yeah. S-sort of.
the greatest mistake is to be continually fearful of making one.
all the other cars were out on quake patrol?
Yes, Crews. That's right.
a stumble may prevent a fall.
besides, my car goes faster.
Yes, Crews, that's right.
but why are you driving?
that's one of your zen questions, right?
one you don't really want an answer to?
to say that we are alive.
when we cease to make mistakes, that is the moment when we cease to be.
the buddha was asked if he ever made mistakes.
he answered, "I am making a mistake"
even now.
nothing more.
this is actually kinda awesome. Watch your back!
thanks for seeing us, Mrs.Tins.
ms. Ehrlich.
I don't use Tins since the divorce.
anything I can do to hurt Arthur, I'm happy to help.
so you don't particularly miss your ex-husband.
I've had cramps I miss more. Shoot him on sight.
you need me to chip in for bullets, just ask.
and your son wouldn't miss his father?
as far as my son is concerned, his father is already dead.
we need a list of your ex-husband's friends or associates, anybody he'd go to if he were in trouble.
Arthur has no friends.
his associates are lowlifes with names like spider and itchy.
they smell like bad meat.
any idea where they work?
when they work, it's in porn stores as clerks so they can steal people's credit card numbers.
or they're installing satellite tvs in people's homes so later they can go back and steal them.
real bunch of winners. All of 'em.
but you want names, addresses? Gimme some paper. I'll make you a list.
it'll be therapeutic.
there are over 50 names on this list. We've gotta narrow it down.
no problem. We just need to talk to the one person who knows the most about Arthur Tins, even more than his ex-wife.
who would that be?
his cellmate.
Olivia. Thank you for coming.
of course, ted. What is it?
I was hoping that maybe you could drive me to the hospital.
it's not bleeding much, so we don't have to worry about your car.
or we could take my car, but you'd probably have to drive, because I have a, uh, pencil in my hand.
Ted. They just announced it on the radio.
there's a 24-hour wait at all the area hospitals.
you have officer McShane on the line.
I have Arthur Tins' cellmate in front of me.
his name is Carl Rossbarrow.
tins was always talking about the getaway, how everybody in prison spent all their time figuring out the score but half-assing the getaway.
tins wanted to figure out something that was the score and the getaway rolled into one.
now do me a favor-- when you catch Tins, don't arrest him, just kill him.
Arthur's all about the getaway.
anybody on that list good at getaways?
uh, there's a guy named chip. Says he's a driver.
have you killed Arthur yet? - no, not yet.
I saw the caller I. D. And I got all excited.
we had a question about your list.
chip. He's a driver?
anything with an engine.
you have any idea where we might find chip these days?
last I saw him, he was working some secure car job.
like armored car? - Yeah.
that would appeal to Arthur.
Yeah, the score and the getaway rolled into one.
ma'am, do you know what company chip worked for?
Yeah, it had a raccoon on the patch holding a pistol.
a raccoon?
it might have been a badger. I don't know. Just do me a favor?
call me back when Arthur's dead.
a badger? With a pistol?
I'll run a trace on chip, but...
but all the police computers are down.
all the police computer systems were built by the lowest bidder.
what we need are other computers.
what we need is blended coffee drinks.
just... Work the phone.
what do you do for a living?
assistant buyer, nordstrom's. Why?
you're my deputy now.
for real? - This is an emergency. I need your help.
I need you to google armored car companies in the L.A .area.
W-what can I do?
blended coffee drinks? - Sweet.
deputy. - That's right.
you think I could get a certificate?
did you feel that? - Yes, I did. Thank you for asking.
what is that?
it's a gun. - He's a cop.
he's my deputy.
okay.
must be nice, pretty girls falling into your lap like that.
any luck with those armored car companies?
got a badger with a pistol?
no, but this one...has a bear with a shotgun.
did you want a muffin too?
Hello, Arthur.
how ya doing?
I think you just dislocated my shoulder there, pally.
yeah? If you're lucky, i'll pop it back in.
Oh, yeah? If you're lucky, maybe I won't kill you.
Where's your partner, Arthur?
I don't know. He should be around any minute now.
please!
do what they say, or they'll kill me!
that's true. You should listen to her.
he'll kill her.
he wants to.
chip, drop the gun. Let her go.
that's not gonna happen.
know why? Cause today is my day.
and if I want her to die on my day, Chip there's gonna kill her for me.
I made a promise to Mark Rawls that I'd get you back to prison, Arthur.
yeah? I don't think so.
see, I don't feel that institution has anything more to teach me.
you gonna uncuff me?
wanna point those guns to the left, please?
that's right... Left.
that's a great getaway car. Or follow car.
so I want you to shoot it up for me.
you want us to shoot the-- - the car!
that pretty I-talian car.
I want you to put some po-lice lead into it.
now!
not bad!
now, I know you got more to give me than that. I want you to get some!
now!
wanna get some! Get some! Get some, get some, get some, get some, get some!
wanna get some, get some! Get some, get some, get some, get some, get some!
wanna get some. Get some, get some, get some.
you don't feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it, can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
gimme the baby. Start the car.
they broke in.
chip Lanter and this other guy, Tins.
chip's been here two years.
you all right?
he's a good driver.
is there an electronic trace on this truck we can use to track his movement?
Yes, of course.
it's not coming up.
chip must have disabled the transponders.
that car could be anywhere.
I'm really more of a leave it in kind of guy.
I've always heard pull it out.
always? What about a corkscrew or-or a stingray barb?
it's not a corkscrew. It's a pencil.
and it's a day's wait at the E.R. So it's coming out right now.
you are so... Lucky, Olivia.
why is that?
well, to be so sure of things. I used to be sure of things.
I can't imagine ever being that way again.
that's just the pencil talking, ted.
you're gonna... Take it out, huh?
all we need is some alcohol.
not rubbing alcohol. Drinking alcohol.
now, what goes with a yellow number 2 pencil?
I did it!
always knew I'd get out. Get you... Get this armored car.
then the quake hits, and everyone runs to the ATMs.
but the ATMs run dry.
so the bank needs to get all that extra cash out to the panicked populace.
that's a miracle, Chip. A seismic miracle.
you know what the best part is? They gonna load it up for us.
like a drive-through. - Yeah.
like a drive-through.
detectives.
there's something you should see.
chip Lanter's personal security beacon.
all the guards carry one.
he's calling us for help.
why would he do that? - where is he?
looks like somewhere in the valley.
you're it? - I'm it.
SWAT's camped out in front of the federal building in anticipation of some sort of civil unrest.
and apparently, the national guard's off somewhere else.
so it's just us.
Yeah, but I'm pretty pissed off.
who is it?
my guess... That's Arthur Tins.
chip was the driver.
never really got to use his getaway car.
Yeah, looks like things didn't work out like he expected.
okay. All right. Yeah.
all right, dispatch says since these two here are pretty well dead, it's gonna be a while before they can send anybody over.
they're stretched pretty thin today.
all right, so they disagree about the cut.
they start shooting at each other, and one of the shots...
hits the car's gas tank?
looks that way.
Yeah, but you think that's what happened?
no. I just said it looks that way.
because you really have to be aiming if you want the gas tank to explode like that.
you really would.
and you really can't tell if that's Arthur Tins or not.
you really can't.
you know, he could have burned up half the cash and still walked away with a fortune.
he really could have.
but Tins is smart.
why do such a bad job at faking your own death?
maybe he doesn't want us thinking he's dead.
well, what does he want?
he wants the next people to think he's dead.
the next people?
Bobby, don't! Don't move! Bobby, don't move!
don't move, okay? Bobby, don't move.
tins needs a bigger mess.
he needs more bodies.
wait a second.
there.
I open that door... - something goes boom.
okay. All right?
pull your hand away from the door.
okay. Walk away.
Charlie, I'M... I'm stuck. My watch is, uh, tangled on the line.
all right. Okay, don't move. I'm gonna cut it
no. I'll cut it.
I'm the commanding officer here. Give me the knife.
step back. Now, detective, give me the knife. Now stand back.
you know, I always had a desire to be standing next to jessica alba when I died.
I get that.
you pull the handle...
the wire pulls the trigger...
and... Boom! Gas goes up.
he wanted the next people to think he was dead.
Yeah, the ones who came to clean us up.
that's why he invited us along here today.
okay, so where is Arthur Tins now?
tin left her behind. - Who?
the president of the armored car company. They left her behind.
maybe they didn't wanna bring her with 'em.
but what good is a hostage if you don't take 'em with you?
why did Tins leave her behind?
maybe...
tins didn't disable the armored car's transponder.
maybe Brimmer told us he disabled it.
maybe Tins left Brimmer behind 'cause he didn't want the lapd to go looking for that armored car.
maybe you two should go pay a visit to june Brimmer.
stark and I will babysit the bacon. What?
think I'd leave you here alone with all this cash?
you have a pencil in your hand. - I do.
but you know, now that I look at it, you can hardly notice it.
really, maybe it's not so bad.
maybe I'm going to have a glove made.
a special glove to fit the pencil.
you're not having a special glove made.
you're having the pencil taken out of your hand.
Ah, but maybe now you've had too much to drink to pull out the pencil.
are you kidding me?
I pull pencils better this way.
are you ready?
you know, when I, uh, woke up at the bottom of the stairs...
and I saw... This...
it was not Charlie that I thought of calling first.
don't say it's the pencil talking, because it's not the pencil talking.
it's me talking.
I wanted to call you, Olivia. - Ted...
I'm marrying Charlie's father.
Yeah.
why haven't you yet?
it's not the pencil talking.
it's not... The pencil talking.
Ted... - yes?
I'm so sorry.
don't be. Don't be. - Not for this.
for this.
detectives.
Hi, june. How are you feeling?
okay. Just... Spending time with my family.
you like music, huh?
we're more about old-school stuff. Beatles.
I really like their second movie.
yeah?
Yeah.
okay, well, we'd just like to ask you some questions.
you know, if you could come by the office tomorrow...that'd be great.
thank you.
you're welcome.
the beatle's second movie was help, you moron.
Hey, june, why don't you show our guests in?
come on in. Sit down.
Hey, you doing okay there?
of course simon's okay.
you're okay.
why don't you let simon come and stand over here by me?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe after dinner.
Where's your partner?
she should be here any minunute.
call for backup?
gonna get the swat all set up on the perimeter?
you came here this morning, took over the house, set up camp.
you should get in on this.
I mean, you can't have any of the crunchy part, but she'll scoop you up some of the gooey stuff in the middle if you want.
won't you, cupcake?
I know what you wanted to happen to us in that warehouse, Arthur.
I'm sorry about that.
I'll live. - Maybe.
or maybe i'll kill you.
why don't you show me your other hand, Arthur?
see, it'd be better for all concerned if your partner would come on in here.
no. It'd be better for all concerned if your partner were to come on in here.
is there someone else in here?
you leave someone here, Arthur?
leave someone while you were out and about?
come on! Don't be shy now.
now you get to see something really good.
dude, you didn't tell me there was macaroni and cheese.
dude.
Crete was just keepin' Mr.Mom company upstairs.
he'd been crying.
a son shouldn't have to see his dad like that.
take him to the car, Crete. We're goin'.
actually, why don't you stay here with us, crete?
how you doing? Where you been?
what's the matter, honey, no swat?
I forgot. Major seismic disturbance.
and you and your understaffed police force
now, if I could vote, which I can't
I vote yes--more cops.
just so you know.
now... We're going for a little family drive.
I'd invite you all-- this family's got a big old suv
but there's already a bunch of us going.
now, I was gonna take off tonight and leave in the dark, you know, but I suppose we should go right now before the gas prices get any higher.
crete? You know Chip is dead?
Yeah, that was the plan. Kill Chip.
what about the other guy? - What other guy?
Hey, Crete. - Donnie Wayne Johnson.
the third man you two escaped with. Where is he?
Hey, Crete!
they're trying to trick you, mess with your head. You ignore them.
he'd be right if there was no third man, but there was a third man.
you... And Arthur, and Donnie all busted out this morning.
what did Arthur do with Donnie? - Crete, go to the car.
Arthur killed Donnie...and used his body to fake his death.
crete, go to the car!
Arthur... Where's Donnie, man?
on his way back from the warehouse.
well, he'd be back by now.
but he's not comin' back, is he, Arthur?
he kills his partners, Crete.
Donnie Chip, you sooner or later.
my guess is sooner.
Arthur, where is Donnie?
crete, as god is my witness, we are a team.
why don't you go ahead and give him a call?
call him on the phone, Crete.
go ahead, give Donnie a call just to say hi.
Arthur! Where is Donnie?
he's at the warehouse
what...
you kill me?
I can't kill you, Arthur. Remember?
you're already dead.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
I'll see you later then, Crews.
what are you sitting on?
earthquake kit.
I can live out of this thing for five days.
water, radio, blankets, food.
it's got a seat.
so after you empty out the bucket, you can use it as a toilet.
you stepped up to a car full of explosives, but earthquakes scare you?
the earth cracking open-- that I don't get.
messed up things people do...
that, detective, I understand. Don't you?
this isn't even a weight-bearing wall.
what? - What?
did you feel that?
is that Mark Rawls over there?
you know Mark Rawls, don't you, Arthur?
you told his son you could get him out of jail.
and then you killed him.
send me somewhere now, and i'll talk.
start talking now.
I killed the kid.
the thing about Olivia, Charlie, is...
she's marrying your father.
she seems really nice. Really.
chasing through the world brings only chaos.
allowing it to come to be brings only peace.
retreat from the world, and it shall pursue you.
to exist, to allow the world to exist, all things at once, all things as one.
this is the path to surrender, to balance.
see yourself as part of the world...
you having a moment?
I know every moment is now, but now we're ten minutes late.
did you feel that?
does someone always have to say that?
I'm standing right next to you. Yes. I felt that.
it was an earthquake. - it was a tremor.
did you feel that?
all right, here's the latest. Four freeways cut. 50 fires.
power grids and water services out city-wide.
busted water mains. Dorm collapse at L. A.U.
now, according to this lapd emergency manual, county emergency operation center will be calling us with our emergency assignments.
so buckle up. It's an emergency.
he's reading with his foot.
no, he's just using it to turn the pages.
it must be his first earthquake.
detective Crews.
officer Danny ritenour, state corrections office. We're having a little emergency.
yeah? Us too.
Yeah, well, that earthquake just facilitated the escape of a prisoner that you put away last year, one Arthur Tins.
what happened?
he was on a work detail when the earthquake hit, and Tins got away.
he's in Los Angeles?
the mother of the kids Tins killed
I do have her address, and we will notify her.
good. She testified in the penalty phase of Tins's trial.
now, is there anyone else he'd wanna even things up with?
cause we have to contact these people.
uh, no. Tins confessed. No one gave him up. The victim's dead.
okay. We're just trying to cover every angle. Thank you.
Hey, have we spoken before?
I don't think so.
you have any connection to the corrections department?
no, sir. Not anymore.
good luck today.
Yeah, okay.
should we tell him that's not a weight-bearing wall and it won't do him any good?
Arthur Tins is not gonna go after anyone.
that weasel's gonna find a rock to hide under and stay hidden.
it's not a question of who Arthur Tins is gonna go after.
it's a question of who's gonna go after Arthur Tins.
paroled out three months ago.
I don't think I like what you're saying.
I don't think I like what I'm saying either.
you're saying we have to stop Arthur Tins from getting killed?
Yeah. I guess we do.
Yeah. I guess we do.
Yeah, I guess you don't.
since when do you go by the book?
you don't even have a regulation haircut.
I go by the book.
I go by this book, the lapd emergency manual, since about an hour ago when the earth opened up and tried to swallow Los Angeles whole.
besides, we have a lot of things to do today.
and none of them are stopping crimes that haven't happened yet.
Oh, god, this is it! Hold on, everyone! It's the big one!
that's funny. Real funny.
okay. No mug shots. Sorry, lapd computers are down.
Arthur Tins. Low rent scam artist.
last year, he killed the 10-year-old son of Mark Rawls.
mark Rawls happened to be doing ten years inside at the time.
Arthur Tins confesses to killing Mark Rawls's 10-year-old son.
he gets life.
Yeah, I heard about that confession.
I heard Tins wasn't talking, and then I heard two lapd detectives that look a lot like you two took Tins to go see rawls in the joint he was doing his time in.
tins took one look at the hard case rawls and sang like a bird.
is that what you heard? - That's what I heard.
rawls got paroled three months ago.
tins escaped this morning, so now they are both out there
LAPD computers are down.
the prison grapevine is not.
and by tonight, Arthur Tins is gonna be dead.
Ooh, two psychos killing each other. You know what that is?
that's a civic improvement project, okay?
like I said before, we're not the future crimes unit, and we all have our assignments out there
even your very own tidwell.
Oh, well, how is tidwell gonna get his assignment out there if tidwell can't leave his doorway?
tidwell is working on it.
and as for you two, today... You're on foot patrol.
hold on!
did you feel that?
tidwell said foot patrol.
we just happen to be patrolling the street where Mark Rawls lives.
how do you get over something like that?
someone like Tins killing your son?
you sit in your cell every day, think about what you'd do to Tins if you ever got the chance.
and that gets you over it?
call for backup. We're gonna take rawls in when we see him.
maybe you should, uh... Button up a little.
button up?
you know, we're goin' into a building full of violent ex-offenders.
you ever see the cartoon where the wolf is staring at the lamb, but what he really sees is lamb chops?
lamb chops.
always a pleasure to see you.
you want some mint jelly with that?
as you can see, I'm doing all right.
nothing structural.
I'd think there'd be a lot of people out there needing your help.
like Arthur Tins?
Oh, Arthur Tins is a guest of the great state of california.
what kind of help could he possibly be needing, detective?
tins escaped. This morning.
he's out.
no. Not angry enough. Try again. - What?
we come here to tell you the man who killed your son has escaped from prison, and you go with, "he's out.
you're lying to us.
how were you planning on spending your day today, Mark?
I did you a favor.
now you do me one and walk away from all this.
okay. I'll do you a favor.
my partner's gonna take her gun out for this next part.
you know the drill.
you should walk away.
he put a bullet in my son.
it's my job on the street to die. You should walk away.
Yeah.
california penal code 12021 is a person who has been convicted of
he killed my son! What would you do, huh?
no killing today, all right, Mark?
why not?
all right, central's not processing new prisoners 'cause of the quake.
so book him in valley division and forward me the paperwork.
we have an assignment to get back to.
I guess you really are a cop. - I guess I am.
you had to do it.
doesn't mean I have to like it.
Oh, come on. Go direct traffic... It'll make you feel better.
it's Tins!
is he okay?
what are you thinkin'?
I'm thinking that when I woke up today I wasn't thinking that I'd have to kill somebody.
now you think you have to?
no. Now I think I want to.
okay, see, as your commanding officer, I hear something like that, I have to take your weapon.
so it's a good thing I didn't hear that.
when did Tins get so smart?
prison gives you a lot of time for self-improvement.
Yeah, prison.
you go in afraid of your own shadow, and you come out a full-blown psycho.
they all come out worse than they went in.
well, maybe not everyone.
Yeah, but how did Tins find us?
location status check. D-247, 400 block. Alvarado street.
our call for backup.
tins heard it off the radio. We told him where rawls was.
we thought we were trailing him, he was trailing us.
wait a minute.
how'd he even know you were gonna go see rawls in the first place?
state corrections didn't even know Tins escaped until ten minutes ago.
well, if they didn't know Tins escaped, then who called us this morning?
tins. - Must have been.
he called to tell us so we'd lead him to rawls.
no Tins, but we found his state prison jumpsuit.
it was stuffed in the garbage can downstairs.
so he's still dressed like a cop.
perfect disguise, especially with the city going to hell.
this is it? No more clothes?
no. Why?
because Tins wasn't alone.
corrections says he escaped from that work detail with two other men
a leonard Crete Debs and a Donnie Wayne Johnson.
when did this get here?
thanks for making me the man I am. Arthur Tins.
so now he's out there somewhere with these two knuckleheads.
any thoughts as to where out there?
known associates from his file?
problem is, all closed case files are computerized now.
Yeah, and what with the quake, the police computers are still down.
what about a living file? Wasn't Tins married?
ex-wives are a beautiful thing, but how are we gonna find her?
if only we had a really big book that listed everybody's names, addresses, and phone numbers.
dude, you are old-school. I'll roust one up.
Charlie! Yeah-- yes. Oh, yes, I-I-I sure did. Yeah.
Yeah, it was quite something. Listen, I-I need to ask for
no. Y-you know what? No, never mind. It's--it's fine.
I-I was really just calling to see how you were.
Yes. I'm fine. Yeah, yeah.
just... Have a pencil in my hand.
it's ted. Yeah. Yeah. How are you?
Oh, I sure did feel it over here. Yes!
problem, uh... Yeah. S-sort of.
the greatest mistake is to be continually fearful of making one.
all the other cars were out on quake patrol?
Yes, Crews. That's right.
a stumble may prevent a fall.
besides, my car goes faster.
Yes, Crews, that's right.
but why are you driving?
that's one of your zen questions, right?
one you don't really want an answer to?
to say that we are alive.
when we cease to make mistakes, that is the moment when we cease to be.
the buddha was asked if he ever made mistakes.
he answered, "I am making a mistake"
even now.
nothing more.
this is actually kinda awesome. Watch your back!
thanks for seeing us, Mrs.Tins.
ms. Ehrlich.
I don't use Tins since the divorce.
anything I can do to hurt Arthur, I'm happy to help.
so you don't particularly miss your ex-husband.
I've had cramps I miss more. Shoot him on sight.
you need me to chip in for bullets, just ask.
and your son wouldn't miss his father?
as far as my son is concerned, his father is already dead.
we need a list of your ex-husband's friends or associates, anybody he'd go to if he were in trouble.
Arthur has no friends.
his associates are lowlifes with names like spider and itchy.
they smell like bad meat.
any idea where they work?
when they work, it's in porn stores as clerks so they can steal people's credit card numbers.
or they're installing satellite tvs in people's homes so later they can go back and steal them.
real bunch of winners. All of 'em.
but you want names, addresses? Gimme some paper. I'll make you a list.
it'll be therapeutic.
there are over 50 names on this list. We've gotta narrow it down.
no problem. We just need to talk to the one person who knows the most about Arthur Tins, even more than his ex-wife.
who would that be?
his cellmate.
Olivia. Thank you for coming.
of course, ted. What is it?
I was hoping that maybe you could drive me to the hospital.
it's not bleeding much, so we don't have to worry about your car.
or we could take my car, but you'd probably have to drive, because I have a, uh, pencil in my hand.
Ted. They just announced it on the radio.
there's a 24-hour wait at all the area hospitals.
you have officer McShane on the line.
I have Arthur Tins' cellmate in front of me.
his name is Carl Rossbarrow.
tins was always talking about the getaway, how everybody in prison spent all their time figuring out the score but half-assing the getaway.
tins wanted to figure out something that was the score and the getaway rolled into one.
now do me a favor-- when you catch Tins, don't arrest him, just kill him.
Arthur's all about the getaway.
anybody on that list good at getaways?
uh, there's a guy named chip. Says he's a driver.
have you killed Arthur yet? - no, not yet.
I saw the caller I. D. And I got all excited.
we had a question about your list.
chip. He's a driver?
anything with an engine.
you have any idea where we might find chip these days?
last I saw him, he was working some secure car job.
like armored car? - Yeah.
that would appeal to Arthur.
Yeah, the score and the getaway rolled into one.
ma'am, do you know what company chip worked for?
Yeah, it had a raccoon on the patch holding a pistol.
a raccoon?
it might have been a badger. I don't know. Just do me a favor?
call me back when Arthur's dead.
a badger? With a pistol?
I'll run a trace on chip, but...
but all the police computers are down.
all the police computer systems were built by the lowest bidder.
what we need are other computers.
what we need is blended coffee drinks.
just... Work the phone.
what do you do for a living?
assistant buyer, nordstrom's. Why?
you're my deputy now.
for real? - This is an emergency. I need your help.
I need you to google armored car companies in the L.A .area.
W-what can I do?
blended coffee drinks? - Sweet.
deputy. - That's right.
you think I could get a certificate?
did you feel that? - Yes, I did. Thank you for asking.
what is that?
it's a gun. - He's a cop.
he's my deputy.
okay.
must be nice, pretty girls falling into your lap like that.
any luck with those armored car companies?
got a badger with a pistol?
no, but this one...has a bear with a shotgun.
did you want a muffin too?
Hello, Arthur.
how ya doing?
I think you just dislocated my shoulder there, pally.
yeah? If you're lucky, i'll pop it back in.
Oh, yeah? If you're lucky, maybe I won't kill you.
Where's your partner, Arthur?
I don't know. He should be around any minute now.
please!
do what they say, or they'll kill me!
that's true. You should listen to her.
he'll kill her.
he wants to.
chip, drop the gun. Let her go.
that's not gonna happen.
know why? Cause today is my day.
and if I want her to die on my day, Chip there's gonna kill her for me.
I made a promise to Mark Rawls that I'd get you back to prison, Arthur.
yeah? I don't think so.
see, I don't feel that institution has anything more to teach me.
you gonna uncuff me?
wanna point those guns to the left, please?
that's right... Left.
that's a great getaway car. Or follow car.
so I want you to shoot it up for me.
you want us to shoot the-- - the car!
that pretty I-talian car.
I want you to put some po-lice lead into it.
now!
not bad!
now, I know you got more to give me than that. I want you to get some!
now!
wanna get some! Get some! Get some, get some, get some, get some, get some!
wanna get some, get some! Get some, get some, get some, get some, get some!
wanna get some. Get some, get some, get some.
you don't feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it, can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
gimme the baby. Start the car.
they broke in.
chip Lanter and this other guy, Tins.
chip's been here two years.
you all right?
he's a good driver.
is there an electronic trace on this truck we can use to track his movement?
Yes, of course.
it's not coming up.
chip must have disabled the transponders.
that car could be anywhere.
I'm really more of a leave it in kind of guy.
I've always heard pull it out.
always? What about a corkscrew or-or a stingray barb?
it's not a corkscrew. It's a pencil.
and it's a day's wait at the E.R. So it's coming out right now.
you are so... Lucky, Olivia.
why is that?
well, to be so sure of things. I used to be sure of things.
I can't imagine ever being that way again.
that's just the pencil talking, ted.
you're gonna... Take it out, huh?
all we need is some alcohol.
not rubbing alcohol. Drinking alcohol.
now, what goes with a yellow number 2 pencil?
I did it!
always knew I'd get out. Get you... Get this armored car.
then the quake hits, and everyone runs to the ATMs.
but the ATMs run dry.
so the bank needs to get all that extra cash out to the panicked populace.
that's a miracle, Chip. A seismic miracle.
you know what the best part is? They gonna load it up for us.
like a drive-through. - Yeah.
like a drive-through.
detectives.
there's something you should see.
chip Lanter's personal security beacon.
all the guards carry one.
he's calling us for help.
why would he do that? - where is he?
looks like somewhere in the valley.
you're it? - I'm it.
SWAT's camped out in front of the federal building in anticipation of some sort of civil unrest.
and apparently, the national guard's off somewhere else.
so it's just us.
Yeah, but I'm pretty pissed off.
who is it?
my guess... That's Arthur Tins.
chip was the driver.
never really got to use his getaway car.
Yeah, looks like things didn't work out like he expected.
okay. All right. Yeah.
all right, dispatch says since these two here are pretty well dead, it's gonna be a while before they can send anybody over.
they're stretched pretty thin today.
all right, so they disagree about the cut.
they start shooting at each other, and one of the shots...
hits the car's gas tank?
looks that way.
Yeah, but you think that's what happened?
no. I just said it looks that way.
because you really have to be aiming if you want the gas tank to explode like that.
you really would.
and you really can't tell if that's Arthur Tins or not.
you really can't.
you know, he could have burned up half the cash and still walked away with a fortune.
he really could have.
but Tins is smart.
why do such a bad job at faking your own death?
maybe he doesn't want us thinking he's dead.
well, what does he want?
he wants the next people to think he's dead.
the next people?
Bobby, don't! Don't move! Bobby, don't move!
don't move, okay? Bobby, don't move.
tins needs a bigger mess.
he needs more bodies.
wait a second.
there.
I open that door... - something goes boom.
okay. All right?
pull your hand away from the door.
okay. Walk away.
Charlie, I'M... I'm stuck. My watch is, uh, tangled on the line.
all right. Okay, don't move. I'm gonna cut it
no. I'll cut it.
I'm the commanding officer here. Give me the knife.
step back. Now, detective, give me the knife. Now stand back.
you know, I always had a desire to be standing next to jessica alba when I died.
I get that.
you pull the handle...
the wire pulls the trigger...
and... Boom! Gas goes up.
he wanted the next people to think he was dead.
Yeah, the ones who came to clean us up.
that's why he invited us along here today.
okay, so where is Arthur Tins now?
tin left her behind. - Who?
the president of the armored car company. They left her behind.
maybe they didn't wanna bring her with 'em.
but what good is a hostage if you don't take 'em with you?
why did Tins leave her behind?
maybe...
tins didn't disable the armored car's transponder.
maybe Brimmer told us he disabled it.
maybe Tins left Brimmer behind 'cause he didn't want the lapd to go looking for that armored car.
maybe you two should go pay a visit to june Brimmer.
stark and I will babysit the bacon. What?
think I'd leave you here alone with all this cash?
you have a pencil in your hand. - I do.
but you know, now that I look at it, you can hardly notice it.
really, maybe it's not so bad.
maybe I'm going to have a glove made.
a special glove to fit the pencil.
you're not having a special glove made.
you're having the pencil taken out of your hand.
Ah, but maybe now you've had too much to drink to pull out the pencil.
are you kidding me?
I pull pencils better this way.
are you ready?
you know, when I, uh, woke up at the bottom of the stairs...
and I saw... This...
it was not Charlie that I thought of calling first.
don't say it's the pencil talking, because it's not the pencil talking.
it's me talking.
I wanted to call you, Olivia. - Ted...
I'm marrying Charlie's father.
Yeah.
why haven't you yet?
it's not the pencil talking.
it's not... The pencil talking.
Ted... - yes?
I'm so sorry.
don't be. Don't be. - Not for this.
for this.
detectives.
Hi, june. How are you feeling?
okay. Just... Spending time with my family.
you like music, huh?
we're more about old-school stuff. Beatles.
I really like their second movie.
yeah?
Yeah.
okay, well, we'd just like to ask you some questions.
you know, if you could come by the office tomorrow...that'd be great.
thank you.
you're welcome.
the beatle's second movie was help, you moron.
Hey, june, why don't you show our guests in?
come on in. Sit down.
Hey, you doing okay there?
of course simon's okay.
you're okay.
why don't you let simon come and stand over here by me?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe after dinner.
Where's your partner?
she should be here any minunute.
call for backup?
gonna get the swat all set up on the perimeter?
you came here this morning, took over the house, set up camp.
you should get in on this.
I mean, you can't have any of the crunchy part, but she'll scoop you up some of the gooey stuff in the middle if you want.
won't you, cupcake?
I know what you wanted to happen to us in that warehouse, Arthur.
I'm sorry about that.
I'll live. - Maybe.
or maybe i'll kill you.
why don't you show me your other hand, Arthur?
see, it'd be better for all concerned if your partner would come on in here.
no. It'd be better for all concerned if your partner were to come on in here.
is there someone else in here?
you leave someone here, Arthur?
leave someone while you were out and about?
come on! Don't be shy now.
now you get to see something really good.
dude, you didn't tell me there was macaroni and cheese.
dude.
Crete was just keepin' Mr.Mom company upstairs.
he'd been crying.
a son shouldn't have to see his dad like that.
take him to the car, Crete. We're goin'.
actually, why don't you stay here with us, crete?
how you doing? Where you been?
what's the matter, honey, no swat?
I forgot. Major seismic disturbance.
and you and your understaffed police force
now, if I could vote, which I can't
I vote yes--more cops.
just so you know.
now... We're going for a little family drive.
I'd invite you all-- this family's got a big old suv
but there's already a bunch of us going.
now, I was gonna take off tonight and leave in the dark, you know, but I suppose we should go right now before the gas prices get any higher.
crete? You know Chip is dead?
Yeah, that was the plan. Kill Chip.
what about the other guy? - What other guy?
Hey, Crete. - Donnie Wayne Johnson.
the third man you two escaped with. Where is he?
Hey, Crete!
they're trying to trick you, mess with your head. You ignore them.
he'd be right if there was no third man, but there was a third man.
you... And Arthur, and Donnie all busted out this morning.
what did Arthur do with Donnie? - Crete, go to the car.
Arthur killed Donnie...and used his body to fake his death.
crete, go to the car!
Arthur... Where's Donnie, man?
on his way back from the warehouse.
well, he'd be back by now.
but he's not comin' back, is he, Arthur?
he kills his partners, Crete.
Donnie Chip, you sooner or later.
my guess is sooner.
Arthur, where is Donnie?
crete, as god is my witness, we are a team.
why don't you go ahead and give him a call?
call him on the phone, Crete.
go ahead, give Donnie a call just to say hi.
Arthur! Where is Donnie?
he's at the warehouse
what...
you kill me?
I can't kill you, Arthur. Remember?
you're already dead.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
I'll see you later then, Crews.
what are you sitting on?
earthquake kit.
I can live out of this thing for five days.
water, radio, blankets, food.
it's got a seat.
so after you empty out the bucket, you can use it as a toilet.
you stepped up to a car full of explosives, but earthquakes scare you?
the earth cracking open-- that I don't get.
messed up things people do...
that, detective, I understand. Don't you?
this isn't even a weight-bearing wall.
what? - What?
did you feel that?
exterminator found him.
setting traps at the neighbor's house.
that's when he saw it. - "It?
is it an "it" or a "him?
it's kind of both.
rat guy said he thought it was a soccer ball or a pumpkin.
that's not a soccer ball. - Or a pumpkin.
you canvass the neighborhood?
knocked on doors, but guess what?
no one saw anything.
Oh, it's not just the head. He's still in one piece.
body's buried underneath him.
looks like he's been dead about a day.
flower petals. Dianthus.
I happen to know flowers.
you ever see one like this before?
you mean made out of a man?
someone made him into a flower.
and left him here on this lawn.
you send flowers, it usually means one of two things.
you're really in love, or you're really sorry.
which one is it?
diabetic. Frank Dunlop.
Frank took a bullet to his chest at close range before he was buried.
you get some real perspective when your head is down here.
is that-- is that Frank's dinner?
label has yesterday's date.
Salisbury steak, peas, and apple brown betty?
Oh, diabetics shouldn't eat apple brown betty.
Beverly hills cares?
let's see if it's true.
Frank was our best driver.
totally committed to others, never missed a day of work.
he was a saint.
can we get a list of his deliveries?
sure.
Frank lived for this place.
always looking to make it better.
um, last week he found a way to raise a ton of money for it.
he say how?
no, but he wasn't just a talker.
if he said that he had a way, he had a way.
he ever mention any problems with his deliveries?
he never complained.
and he was the one who ran food to all the crazies.
the crazies?
like sketchy people, troublemakers.
Frank actually seemed to like them.
any live near north valley circle?
I got...
two on Vista Vierra.
that's near valley circle, right?
I got a Flint Garber on 1818 Vista Vierra, and a Maude Paxton on...
1818 Vista Vierra.
yes?
are you Maude Paxton?
I am, have you brought the food?
no, we haven't.
actually, we're here about the person who brings the food. May we come in?
of course.
has something happened to Frank?
where the hell's my food?
flint Garber. - Who are you?
how do you know my name? Did you bring my food?
they know your name?
flint, they're here about Frank.
I'm detective Reese, and this is detective Crews.
you just let anybody in the house.
we'd like to ask you some, uh-- we'd like to talk to you about Frank Dunlop.
well, Frank didn't show up today.
does that mean I don't get my food?
when was the last time you saw Frank?
the day before yesterday.
he comes every day.
you'd never met a sweeter soul than Frank.
can we ask where you were last night?
you can ask. Free country.
he was here. He's always here.
always? You never leave?
can't. Nobody steal my stuff. Valuable stuff.
and Maude, where were you last night?
here too. We were watching the TV.
it was my turn with the remote.
Oh, we're roommates. - Yeah, just roommates.
so now look, if you don't have any food for me, you just get the hell off my property.
the two roommates Flint Garber and Maude Paxton are both clean slates;
no rap sheets on either.
Frank Dunlop's clean too. Not even a parking ticket.
maybe this guy really was a saint.
only one saint walked this earth. - Who's that?
my mother. - His mother.
I searched the vi-cap database.
the last murder listed with dianthus on the victim was in... um
the 70s. Johnny Hazlit.
weird cult, the Hazlits.
killed ten people, never got convicted.
Hazlit overdosed on drugs in 1972.
what about the rest of the Hazlits?
the ones we can trace are either in prison or dead.
but a lot of them just went underground and disappeared.
okay. No leaks, no press.
if the press hears that the Hazlits are still out there, or there's a copycat, all hell breaks loose and we'll never solve this.
get online and get me everything you can about Hazlit.
there won't be a lot in the database from back then. It's ancient history.
well, okay, you two are off to LAPD dead record storage.
why go there when we can go somewhere where history comes alive?
Los Angeles museum of murder and mayhem.
Lamomam.
people actually pay to see this?
maybe we don't see the value because we get it for free.
and you knew about this place because...
came here on a date once.
it was her idea.
guitar said to have been given to Johnny Hazlit by Donovan in 1968.
they called him "mellow yellow."
Johnny Hazlit's personal teddy bear.
I'm the one who acquired that piece from a collector in japan.
can we help you with something?
are you the owners?
Yes, I'm Squeaky. This is Tex.
we met at a ted Bundy auction.
he outbid me. - but she seduced me.
I paid for the guitar.
how much of this stuff is real?
we're very precise about the provenance of everything here.
Provenance? - Yes, an object's place of origin.
proof that it is what it is.
any of the "its" here a 0 . 45 caliber handgun?
no. Famous murder guns are too expensive for us.
they start around 10, 000 and go up from there.
$10, 000 for a gun?
well, a gun that killed somebody. - Provenance.
mass murder memorabilia is a huge and growing market.
sadly, very little comes on the market.
most collectors are private.
japanese eat it up.
but they keep their collections to themselves.
we'd like to look at your archives.
because you're homicide detectives?
he's Charlie Crews.
two murders short of making the mass murder room.
we have a minimum of five.
actually, I was five murders short.
she means before you were innocent.
or before we knew you were innocent.
of course, there's talk of what you did in prison.
there's talk about a lot of things.
ever see this guy before?
uh, no. Is he a murder victim?
you're homicide detectives. Asked about the gun.
feel free to look around for a while.
we are a museum. We want you to look.
Hazlit used dianthus to decorate his kills, but he never buried any of them.
all his victims were shot with a 0. 45 like Frank Dunlop.
Hazlit's 0. 45 was never found.
and Hazlit's dead, so copycat.
you ever hear of a copycat killing 30 years after the original?
people are still pretty into this.
some more than others.
all right, let's get alibis on Tex and Squeaky.
they did ask us to look.
Oh, look at this.
looks like Hazlit had a bunch of kids with different women.
they would ended up in social services after the arrests.
some of them may still be around.
wanna see if any of them went into the family business?
eight wives, 43 children.
eight wives all at the same time?
that's like 1, 000 pounds of wife in the house. No wonder Hazlit was crazy.
I always thought I'd have a lot of kids.
house full of noise. Chaos.
what about you, detective Reese?
I don't think it's a good idea for me to have children.
why is that?
because it wouldn't be.
me? I'd like two kids. - Well, good luck with that.
according to these files we got from social services, the kids that were taken from Hazlit in 1972 were given their mother's last name.
makes sense. You wouldn't want "Hazlit" on the back of your hockey jersey.
one of those mother's names was Garber.
her son is Flint Garber ... Hazlit.
let me guess. Another mother's last name was Paxton?
her daughter's name was Maude Paxton ... Hazlit.
Johnny Hazlit had two kids living a chip shot from the murder?
I guess you figured out who our pappy was.
Maude, where's flint? - He's inside.
he's got a gun, but it isn't loaded, so don't shoot him.
don't you steal my stuff.
we're not here for your stuff, Flint.
we're here for you.
the last time we were here, you didn't say you were Hazlits.
you didn't ask if we were Hazlits. Last time you were here.
it's not the kind of thing we advertise.
word gets out, townsfolk start lighting the torches.
Frank Dunlop know who you were?
does Frank know we grew up surrounded by death covered in blood?
no, we don't speak about it.
Frank was the...
was the kind of guy you could talk to. He was uh...
he was a real good listener.
Frank is the only one I ever talked to about us being -- us.
there are three bedrooms being used in this house.
if one of them is yours, Maude, and the other one is Flint's, then who sleeps in the other bedroom?
Clifton. My son.
not my son. Clifton is my nephew.
Where's Clifton today?
he hasn't been around since Monday.
you know where we can find him?
if Frank is the only person you ever talked to about it... Flint?
does your son know he's a Hazlit?
he'd use it against me. The way I grew up.
you're not gonna tell Clifton about this, are you?
well, now we have three Hazlits living just a chip shot away from Frank's murder.
detectives. Got a gun here.
got another one over here. And a knife; dried blood on it.
that's just junk I collected over the years.
I mean, I couldn't killed Frank. I never leave this house.
we were watching TV that night.
okay. Well, we're just gonna ask you to come along with us.
run some tests on those weapons.
if you'd like to just stand up for us, please, and put your hands behind your backs.
is that really necessary?
Oh, alrighty.
once I saw pappy kill a man while he was handcuffed.
strangled him with the chain.
said it was proof of the master-slave relationship.
a victim was found shot at a foreclosed house, that's all I can tell you.
Johnny Hazlit? Didn't he play for the dodgers?
Oh, must be a different one. Never heard of him.
the press are all over us.
they know about the victim being buried up to his neck?
only us and the killer have that detail. you giving interviews?
no, but-- - but what, my good detectives?
Lamomam? - Lamomam. You drive.
you wanna step away from the car?
it's my car. Why would I wanna step away from it?
cause she asked you to.
you know Frank Dunlop?
Frankie meals on wheels? Why?
because your father and aunt have just been arrested in connection with his murder.
my father never leaves the house.
and my aunt, she's-- she's practically Mrs. Butterworth.
wait, someone-- someone killed Frankie Dunlop?
do you always keep your car so clean, Clifton?
shampooing the trunk?
Yeah, it took every penny that I have.
so I like to take care of it.
took every penny you have?
is that why you're living at home?
no, it's how every 23-year-old wants to roll.
how come you think that my dad and aunt are involved?
we found guns at the house.
Yeah. My dad's got a lot of junk.
but like I said, he doesn't go out.
you mind if we take a sample from this carpet back there?
Yeah, I do. A lot.
might depreciate the value.
your dad seemed to like Frank.
guess so.
the way he talked about him, guess he thought of Frank kind of as a son.
but you're his son, so...
where you been these last few days?
you wanna give us her name?
not really.
Reese, you wanna tell Clifton about the family plan we have at lockup?
you're dating Clifton Garber?
for about a year.
why didn't you tell us last time we were here?
something you're protecting Clifton from?
he and Frank didn't get along.
Frank was very sweet, and Clifton didn't believe anybody could be that sweet.
it made Clifton so mad.
Mindy, did Clifton ever mention his father? Or his aunt?
Where's your partner Squeaky, Tex?
at an auction. - You talk to the press?
the press? About the Hazlit killing? Nuh-uh. No, sir.
if you did, you'd be getting in the way of my investigation.
you know, not everyone thinks he's innocent.
excuse me? - Your old partner. Check the websites.
a lot of people out there still think he killed that family.
about a year ago, Clifton came in to sign his dad and aunt up for the program.
his dad's some kind of a shut-in, and his aunt forgets things.
like to shop and stuff.
so Clifton arranged for meals to be delivered to the house.
to make sure that they had food.
in case he was working and didn't get home to feed them.
I think that Clifton hated Frank because Clifton's afraid of his own sweetness.
and Clifton was with you?
and you're not afraid of his sweetness?
no, not at all. Why should I be?
we have a few empty display cases in there for your old partner if it turns out, you know, he did do that family.
we're gonna go now, Tex. You remember what I said.
Hey, anything of Crews's you'd be willing to sell me?
uh, some shoes? Or a used coffee cup? Just in case?
you gonna talk to ray born?
said he's got something to tell me.
that FBI agent said you go after ray born, you go back to jail.
well, that's just the way they talk.
I couldn't go back to jail.
no one is going back to jail, Ted.
it's a wedding invitation.
to your father's wedding.
putting aside the fact that you say you're in love with the woman who is going to marry my father,
I have not said a word to my dad in 12 years.
I'm not going to his wedding. Why would you wanna go?
I do love her, Charlie.
Ted, she is marrying my father.
you know? It might be easier to think of who set me up for those murders than you and...
you know how small a cancer cell is?
very small?
think about all the ass you've kicked in your life, and in the end,
I'm gonna get cored out like an apple by something I can't even take a swing at.
you know, I think you're the reason I went to jail.
because you saw a photo.
you know, I think you're the reason my friends were murdered.
so I guess I'm not exactly sure why you think I care you're dying.
well, for one thing, you might save yourself a bullet, and for another, when I'm dead, I'm dead.
I know your secret, detective.
well, that's good to hear. Cause as it turns out, I don't know my secret.
all those words help keep the dark thoughts away?
your secret is you want to come out of the dark, but you can't.
you want to leave behind the blood, but you can't.
you want to let go of revenge, but you can't.
how do you know that?
I know that because I know that.
see? I also have words, detective.
and I also have photos.
you know this guy?
can't place him.
Yeah, okay.
you see that look on his face, that smug fed smile.
he works for the FBI. Maybe you knew that.
I thought you said you had photos.
well, special agent bonder, here, works for the FBI.
he does a little moonlighting, though.
he works for someone else too.
yeah? Who's that?
Roman Nabokov. I know you know him.
I know you wanted him.
and I know that bonder took him away.
bodner works for Roman.
was the Dunlop killing a Hazlit copycat?
we're pursuing all leads.
wow, looks like the leak got bigger.
bet their business is booming.
at this point in time, I would ask for your patience and allow us to do our job. Thank you.
you fail to mention the victim was found buried up to his neck, or that there were flowers found scattered around the body, just like Johnny Hazlit used to do it.
Yes, I failed to mention that.
you failed to mention that the victim was found near the home of Flint Garber, 1818 Vista Vierra.
Yeah, failed to mention that. Also failed to mention something else.
what's that? - You're under arrest.
Yeah, okay. One more thing:
flint Garber and Maude Paxton were the children of Johnny Hazlit.
there's a grandson too, Clifton.
a house full of Hazlits around the block from the murder.
come on, that's enough.
that Frank Dunlop's body was buried up to the neck is a detail that didn't go to the press.
we keep certain facts to ourselves.
then the only people who know those facts are us cops, or the killer.
come on, lap leaks like a sieve.
where do you think we get most of our information from?
maybe it was a tribute murder.
or a copycat. There's a difference.
it's subtle, but it's there.
you should teach a class.
Hey, maybe we could get your partner to give a guest lecture.
what do you think, Squeaky, should we do it?
actually, I do know the difference between copycat and tribute.
detail I picked up at lamomam.
let me see if I get this right.
Hazlit left flowers by his kills.
now, if Frank Dunlop's body had had flowers surrounding it, - that would been a copycat, yes? - Yes.
but Frank Dunlop's body the way it was found?
it was a flower that someone left for Hazlit, and that's a tribute.
okay, Hazlit didn't like people who lied or broke promises to him.
Frank Dunlop ever break any promises to you?
we didn't know Frank Dunlop.
we just find Hazlit fascinating.
like the rest of the world. Like you two.
well, we'll be less fascinated once we find Frank Dunlop's killer.
maybe you won't be able to.
maybe you'll always find him fascinating.
Oh, like a song you can't get out of your head?
Yeah, man. Like that.
do you have alibis for the night Frank Dunlop was killed?
at an auction for hillside strangler items.
we were both there.
are we suspects now?
do you wanna be?
that'll be good for ticket sales.
we'll check out your alibi.
if it all pans out, you get to go home.
take your time.
auction house employees saw Squeaky and Tex that night.
but it was, in their words, "a mob scene for all that hillside strangler swag."
I'm not sure I understand a world where that stuff sells at auctions.
well, they got what they wanted. Publicity.
Bobby! - On it!
coming through! Move it! Move!
I always wanted to know what a Hazlit tasted like.
meet Clifton Hazlit, Johnny Hazlit's grandson.
come on. Make a lane! Make a lane! Make a lane!
I look just like Hazlit, don't I?
all my life, I thought there was something wrong with me.
turns out there is.
the man you hit isn't gonna press charges.
they exposed me, what happens to them?
I should done what my grandfather would've.
what's that?
made them pay in blood.
Clifton? You're no different than you were before you found out.
Oh, I'm different. You heard her.
now I'm Johnny Hazlit's grandson.
all right, well, you know, we can let you out the back.
why the back?
because those photographers, they're waiting for you out front.
Hello? - Who is this?
this is Charles Crews. Who is this?
I was looking for Olivia.
I thought I dialed her cell phone.
you dialed the house.
she's out trying on her wedding dress for the 10, 000th time.
you want me to leave her a message for you?
uh, tell her... somebody called.
somebody? What the
somebody? Somebody called?
Oh, great.
red light? Did I run it?
license and registration.
you know why we pulled you over, Mr. Earley?
I blew through that light.
I'm gonna run these.
gun!
show me your hands!
out of the car.
on your knees.
I'm sorry, I have a friend on the force.
on your knees.
found this next to the gun.
that is not mine. Not the gun, not whatever's in that baggie.
Oh, guys. Guys, please. I'm--I'm on parole.
Maude Paxton-Hazlit and Flint Garber-Hazlit alibi each other.
so they both did it, or they both didn't do it?
what about the guns found out at the house?
none of them match the bullets found in Frank Dunlop.
we're running 'Them down to see if they match up to any other crimes.
squeaky and Tex?
they alibi each other too.
so they both did it or they both didn't do it.
what about the grandson, young Clifton?
he was with his girlfriend.
or maybe not.
Mindy! Is it true you're in a relationship with Clifton Garber?
that is not true.
didn't you tell the police you were in a relationship with Johnny Hazlit's grandson?
no.
your father?
he get you to say what you did to those reporters?
I'm sorry if I wasted your time.
you're withdrawing your statement?
a man was killed, Mindy. A man you knew.
what did you call him? A saint?
Clifton asked me to cover for him and I did.
we weren't having a relationship.
I only knew him from the food bank.
I wasn't having a relationship with Clifton Garber.
it was a mistake and I'm sorry.
wow, what do you think, detective Crews?
I think that's a nice speech.
did you write it, or did your dad?
I have to go now.
you like Clifton?
cause he's not from your world.
he's not your dad over there.
he drives for people like your dad.
Mindy, are you recanting because you really weren't with Clifton?
or is it because it turns out the man you were with is a Hazlit?
I wasn't with Clifton.
you're looking at obstruction of justice.
do you understand that?
my father said his lawyers will call you about that. I have to go.
do you believe her? - Nope.
her dad finds out his daughter is linked to a Hazlit, and Clifton Garber loses his alibi.
Yeah.
it's a weird thing to hold against somebody.
what? - Their blood.
Yep. We'll be right there.
Lamomam, shots fired.
is he dead, is Tex dead?
did you see who it was?
Yeah. I did. He was here.
who was here?
Hazlit. It was Johnny Hazlit.
I heard the gun and I turned.
Tex was on the ground.
and then I saw him.
you saw Johnny Hazlit with the gun?
I saw the gun.
it looked bigger in his hands, bu--but it was his hand.
it was Johnny Hazlit.
he shot Tex, and then he shot me, and then he dropped the gun and ran.
Squeaky, sometimes when you see a gun like that, that's all you see.
it confuses everything else.
I wasn't confused. It was Johnny.
he was here. I saw him.
but he ran.
well, we know Johnny Hazlit didn't do it.
cause he's dead?
let's get some gunshot residue tests done on Squeaky and Tex hurry.
Yeah. Only one of them is dead, but both of them are crazy.
maybe she did see Johnny Hazlit.
that would be the crazy part.
what if you found out there was something in your blood that you didn't know was there?
the guy I hit? That museum freak.
that's right. The museum that exposed you as a Hazlit.
you think I killed that grebe.
like you said, it's what your grandfather would done.
you have good reason.
yeah? I also have an alibi.
I been here all night.
and so have they.
and they're not gonna recant like Mindy.
Yeah! All right.
Nope, they like me for who I am.
Yeah. Everywhere I go, they go.
wanna take a picture with me?
no? Okay.
you live in this limo cause you don't wanna go home.
I'd rather never step foot back in that house again.
but you can't afford anywhere else.
that's right. - Because this limo took all your cash.
which is why you moved home in the first place.
Yeah. Limo took all my cash.
so if you don't have any money, who pays the mortgage on that house?
dad, I guess.
with what? Did flint ever have a job?
dad never worked a day in his life.
gunshot residue test on Squeaky and Tex came back negative.
Thanks, Bobby.
you don't work. We checked.
you don't collect social security.
would've had to use your real name for that?
so how do you pay the mortgage, Flint?
and the utilities?
you sell some of your stuff?
it's valuable stuff. It's my legacy.
it all belonged to Johnny Hazlit.
that's right. - Who bought it?
collectors overseas.
do you know Squeaky and Tex Uhry?
they made me a couple of lowball offers.
didn't have any cash.
they couldn't match those foreign offers.
did Frank know the hurry's?
I told him not to sell to them.
go for that foreign money.
why would Frank sell anything? It's all your stuff.
Mindy said Frank told her he found a way to raise a lot of money.
flint, did you give anything to Frank?
all of it.
so he could sell it?
Frank would just used it for charity.
Frank listened to me.
and he said that he could do good things with that money.
and that...
and that would make you good.
but I told him to stick with the foreign buyers.
detectives.
that's the gun found at the museum.
Yeah, the one that shot Squeaky and Tex.
ballistics confirmed that.
and that gun there matches the slugs pulled from Frank Dunlop.
what?
we pulled some prints off the grip. We got a match.
guess who.
but he's been dead for over 30 years.
provenance.
Hazlit's back!!
we're sorry for your loss.
Tex would've wanted this.
why'd you kill Frank Dunlop?
I didn't kill Frank Dunlop.
Frank was told not to sell to you.
all that sweet Hazlit swag going overseas where they get a better price.
is that why you killed him?
then making him look like this?
that's just good for business.
it really paid off.
Tex and I were at that auction.
you know, that auction was so crowded, you and Tex could've left, and no one would've even noticed.
that's what we call a "soft alibi."
why'd you kill Tex, Squeaky?
I didn't kill Tex.
he get nervous about that "soft alibi" ?
I don't know who killed Frank Dunlop.
but Johnny Hazlit killed Tex.
he was here, I saw him.
Johnny Hazlit is dead.
it says so right on that exhibit.
the person who owned Hazlit's gun, that's who killed Tex.
tracked the money order of yours, Squeaky.
$15, 000 last month to japan.
you know, that's a lot of money to spend on a gun.
but I guess you have to spend money to make money.
checked your bank. That was every last penny you had.
you owned that gun. Why didn't you exhibit it?
cause you were using it.
what's that word, Crews? - Provenance.
that was Hazlit. He was here, I saw him!
that gun has his prints!
guess she's working on her insanity defense.
maybe it was Hazlit back from the dead.
or maybe Squeaky and Tex were wearing gloves.
if those gloves were part of the murder, you'd have to put them on display.
because she knew they were real. - Crews?
Charlie! - Let's get outtalk here.
Yeah. Let's get out here.
you run a lean operation here.
plenty of fresh produce, though, foundation of any good meal.
Where's Rachel? Your niece?
she's not my niece.
I know who that girl is, detective.
she went out. Some musician-type called on her. Not my type.
I wouldn't let him near my daughters.
Where's Ted? - Ted.
we'll get to that in a moment.
what did Mickey Rayborn say to you?
that's between me and him.
I thought that'd be your answer.
detective, what did I tell you would happen if you went after ray born?
I told you you'd go back to jail.
but I'm not in jail.
you'll get to Ted in a moment?
I'd like that moment to be now.
we did some thinking back at our thinking room, and on reflection, threatening you with jail might not be that much of a threat.
you wanna try this?
I'm good. - You sure?
I got it right where I want it.
Where's ted?
probably still out at county.
but I'd say he'd be at supermax by noon tomorrow.
you can't drive around with a gun and coke.
you know ted can't hack another stretch.
you went after ray born, and you got in.
now you gonna stay in and do what we tell you.
you make sure that stay at a simmer, and run a spoon through it every once in a while.
exterminator found him.
setting traps at the neighbor's house.
that's when he saw it. - "It?
is it an "it" or a "him?
it's kind of both.
rat guy said he thought it was a soccer ball or a pumpkin.
that's not a soccer ball. - Or a pumpkin.
you canvass the neighborhood?
knocked on doors, but guess what?
no one saw anything.
Oh, it's not just the head. He's still in one piece.
body's buried underneath him.
looks like he's been dead about a day.
flower petals. Dianthus.
I happen to know flowers.
you ever see one like this before?
you mean made out of a man?
someone made him into a flower.
and left him here on this lawn.
you send flowers, it usually means one of two things.
you're really in love, or you're really sorry.
which one is it?
diabetic. Frank Dunlop.
Frank took a bullet to his chest at close range before he was buried.
you get some real perspective when your head is down here.
is that-- is that Frank's dinner?
label has yesterday's date.
Salisbury steak, peas, and apple brown betty?
Oh, diabetics shouldn't eat apple brown betty.
Beverly hills cares?
let's see if it's true.
Frank was our best driver.
totally committed to others, never missed a day of work.
he was a saint.
can we get a list of his deliveries?
sure.
Frank lived for this place.
always looking to make it better.
um, last week he found a way to raise a ton of money for it.
he say how?
no, but he wasn't just a talker.
if he said that he had a way, he had a way.
he ever mention any problems with his deliveries?
he never complained.
and he was the one who ran food to all the crazies.
the crazies?
like sketchy people, troublemakers.
Frank actually seemed to like them.
any live near north valley circle?
I got...
two on Vista Vierra.
that's near valley circle, right?
I got a Flint Garber on 1818 Vista Vierra, and a Maude Paxton on...
1818 Vista Vierra.
yes?
are you Maude Paxton?
I am, have you brought the food?
no, we haven't.
actually, we're here about the person who brings the food. May we come in?
of course.
has something happened to Frank?
where the hell's my food?
flint Garber. - Who are you?
how do you know my name? Did you bring my food?
they know your name?
flint, they're here about Frank.
I'm detective Reese, and this is detective Crews.
you just let anybody in the house.
we'd like to ask you some, uh-- we'd like to talk to you about Frank Dunlop.
well, Frank didn't show up today.
does that mean I don't get my food?
when was the last time you saw Frank?
the day before yesterday.
he comes every day.
you'd never met a sweeter soul than Frank.
can we ask where you were last night?
you can ask. Free country.
he was here. He's always here.
always? You never leave?
can't. Nobody steal my stuff. Valuable stuff.
and Maude, where were you last night?
here too. We were watching the TV.
it was my turn with the remote.
Oh, we're roommates. - Yeah, just roommates.
so now look, if you don't have any food for me, you just get the hell off my property.
the two roommates Flint Garber and Maude Paxton are both clean slates;
no rap sheets on either.
Frank Dunlop's clean too. Not even a parking ticket.
maybe this guy really was a saint.
only one saint walked this earth. - Who's that?
my mother. - His mother.
I searched the vi-cap database.
the last murder listed with dianthus on the victim was in... um
the 70s. Johnny Hazlit.
weird cult, the Hazlits.
killed ten people, never got convicted.
Hazlit overdosed on drugs in 1972.
what about the rest of the Hazlits?
the ones we can trace are either in prison or dead.
but a lot of them just went underground and disappeared.
okay. No leaks, no press.
if the press hears that the Hazlits are still out there, or there's a copycat, all hell breaks loose and we'll never solve this.
get online and get me everything you can about Hazlit.
there won't be a lot in the database from back then. It's ancient history.
well, okay, you two are off to LAPD dead record storage.
why go there when we can go somewhere where history comes alive?
Los Angeles museum of murder and mayhem.
Lamomam.
people actually pay to see this?
maybe we don't see the value because we get it for free.
and you knew about this place because...
came here on a date once.
it was her idea.
guitar said to have been given to Johnny Hazlit by Donovan in 1968.
they called him "mellow yellow."
Johnny Hazlit's personal teddy bear.
I'm the one who acquired that piece from a collector in japan.
can we help you with something?
are you the owners?
Yes, I'm Squeaky. This is Tex.
we met at a ted Bundy auction.
he outbid me. - but she seduced me.
I paid for the guitar.
how much of this stuff is real?
we're very precise about the provenance of everything here.
Provenance? - Yes, an object's place of origin.
proof that it is what it is.
any of the "its" here a 0 . 45 caliber handgun?
no. Famous murder guns are too expensive for us.
they start around 10, 000 and go up from there.
$10, 000 for a gun?
well, a gun that killed somebody. - Provenance.
mass murder memorabilia is a huge and growing market.
sadly, very little comes on the market.
most collectors are private.
japanese eat it up.
but they keep their collections to themselves.
we'd like to look at your archives.
because you're homicide detectives?
he's Charlie Crews.
two murders short of making the mass murder room.
we have a minimum of five.
actually, I was five murders short.
she means before you were innocent.
or before we knew you were innocent.
of course, there's talk of what you did in prison.
there's talk about a lot of things.
ever see this guy before?
uh, no. Is he a murder victim?
you're homicide detectives. Asked about the gun.
feel free to look around for a while.
we are a museum. We want you to look.
Hazlit used dianthus to decorate his kills, but he never buried any of them.
all his victims were shot with a 0. 45 like Frank Dunlop.
Hazlit's 0. 45 was never found.
and Hazlit's dead, so copycat.
you ever hear of a copycat killing 30 years after the original?
people are still pretty into this.
some more than others.
all right, let's get alibis on Tex and Squeaky.
they did ask us to look.
Oh, look at this.
looks like Hazlit had a bunch of kids with different women.
they would ended up in social services after the arrests.
some of them may still be around.
wanna see if any of them went into the family business?
eight wives, 43 children.
eight wives all at the same time?
that's like 1, 000 pounds of wife in the house. No wonder Hazlit was crazy.
I always thought I'd have a lot of kids.
house full of noise. Chaos.
what about you, detective Reese?
I don't think it's a good idea for me to have children.
why is that?
because it wouldn't be.
me? I'd like two kids. - Well, good luck with that.
according to these files we got from social services, the kids that were taken from Hazlit in 1972 were given their mother's last name.
makes sense. You wouldn't want "Hazlit" on the back of your hockey jersey.
one of those mother's names was Garber.
her son is Flint Garber ... Hazlit.
let me guess. Another mother's last name was Paxton?
her daughter's name was Maude Paxton ... Hazlit.
Johnny Hazlit had two kids living a chip shot from the murder?
I guess you figured out who our pappy was.
Maude, where's flint? - He's inside.
he's got a gun, but it isn't loaded, so don't shoot him.
don't you steal my stuff.
we're not here for your stuff, Flint.
we're here for you.
the last time we were here, you didn't say you were Hazlits.
you didn't ask if we were Hazlits. Last time you were here.
it's not the kind of thing we advertise.
word gets out, townsfolk start lighting the torches.
Frank Dunlop know who you were?
does Frank know we grew up surrounded by death covered in blood?
no, we don't speak about it.
Frank was the...
was the kind of guy you could talk to. He was uh...
he was a real good listener.
Frank is the only one I ever talked to about us being -- us.
there are three bedrooms being used in this house.
if one of them is yours, Maude, and the other one is Flint's, then who sleeps in the other bedroom?
Clifton. My son.
not my son. Clifton is my nephew.
Where's Clifton today?
he hasn't been around since Monday.
you know where we can find him?
if Frank is the only person you ever talked to about it... Flint?
does your son know he's a Hazlit?
he'd use it against me. The way I grew up.
you're not gonna tell Clifton about this, are you?
well, now we have three Hazlits living just a chip shot away from Frank's murder.
detectives. Got a gun here.
got another one over here. And a knife; dried blood on it.
that's just junk I collected over the years.
I mean, I couldn't killed Frank. I never leave this house.
we were watching TV that night.
okay. Well, we're just gonna ask you to come along with us.
run some tests on those weapons.
if you'd like to just stand up for us, please, and put your hands behind your backs.
is that really necessary?
Oh, alrighty.
once I saw pappy kill a man while he was handcuffed.
strangled him with the chain.
said it was proof of the master-slave relationship.
a victim was found shot at a foreclosed house, that's all I can tell you.
Johnny Hazlit? Didn't he play for the dodgers?
Oh, must be a different one. Never heard of him.
the press are all over us.
they know about the victim being buried up to his neck?
only us and the killer have that detail. you giving interviews?
no, but-- - but what, my good detectives?
Lamomam? - Lamomam. You drive.
you wanna step away from the car?
it's my car. Why would I wanna step away from it?
cause she asked you to.
you know Frank Dunlop?
Frankie meals on wheels? Why?
because your father and aunt have just been arrested in connection with his murder.
my father never leaves the house.
and my aunt, she's-- she's practically Mrs. Butterworth.
wait, someone-- someone killed Frankie Dunlop?
do you always keep your car so clean, Clifton?
shampooing the trunk?
Yeah, it took every penny that I have.
so I like to take care of it.
took every penny you have?
is that why you're living at home?
no, it's how every 23-year-old wants to roll.
how come you think that my dad and aunt are involved?
we found guns at the house.
Yeah. My dad's got a lot of junk.
but like I said, he doesn't go out.
you mind if we take a sample from this carpet back there?
Yeah, I do. A lot.
might depreciate the value.
your dad seemed to like Frank.
guess so.
the way he talked about him, guess he thought of Frank kind of as a son.
but you're his son, so...
where you been these last few days?
you wanna give us her name?
not really.
Reese, you wanna tell Clifton about the family plan we have at lockup?
you're dating Clifton Garber?
for about a year.
why didn't you tell us last time we were here?
something you're protecting Clifton from?
he and Frank didn't get along.
Frank was very sweet, and Clifton didn't believe anybody could be that sweet.
it made Clifton so mad.
Mindy, did Clifton ever mention his father? Or his aunt?
Where's your partner Squeaky, Tex?
at an auction. - You talk to the press?
the press? About the Hazlit killing? Nuh-uh. No, sir.
if you did, you'd be getting in the way of my investigation.
you know, not everyone thinks he's innocent.
excuse me? - Your old partner. Check the websites.
a lot of people out there still think he killed that family.
about a year ago, Clifton came in to sign his dad and aunt up for the program.
his dad's some kind of a shut-in, and his aunt forgets things.
like to shop and stuff.
so Clifton arranged for meals to be delivered to the house.
to make sure that they had food.
in case he was working and didn't get home to feed them.
I think that Clifton hated Frank because Clifton's afraid of his own sweetness.
and Clifton was with you?
and you're not afraid of his sweetness?
no, not at all. Why should I be?
we have a few empty display cases in there for your old partner if it turns out, you know, he did do that family.
we're gonna go now, Tex. You remember what I said.
Hey, anything of Crews's you'd be willing to sell me?
uh, some shoes? Or a used coffee cup? Just in case?
you gonna talk to ray born?
said he's got something to tell me.
that FBI agent said you go after ray born, you go back to jail.
well, that's just the way they talk.
I couldn't go back to jail.
no one is going back to jail, Ted.
it's a wedding invitation.
to your father's wedding.
putting aside the fact that you say you're in love with the woman who is going to marry my father,
I have not said a word to my dad in 12 years.
I'm not going to his wedding. Why would you wanna go?
I do love her, Charlie.
Ted, she is marrying my father.
you know? It might be easier to think of who set me up for those murders than you and...
you know how small a cancer cell is?
very small?
think about all the ass you've kicked in your life, and in the end,
I'm gonna get cored out like an apple by something I can't even take a swing at.
you know, I think you're the reason I went to jail.
because you saw a photo.
you know, I think you're the reason my friends were murdered.
so I guess I'm not exactly sure why you think I care you're dying.
well, for one thing, you might save yourself a bullet, and for another, when I'm dead, I'm dead.
I know your secret, detective.
well, that's good to hear. Cause as it turns out, I don't know my secret.
all those words help keep the dark thoughts away?
your secret is you want to come out of the dark, but you can't.
you want to leave behind the blood, but you can't.
you want to let go of revenge, but you can't.
how do you know that?
I know that because I know that.
see? I also have words, detective.
and I also have photos.
you know this guy?
can't place him.
Yeah, okay.
you see that look on his face, that smug fed smile.
he works for the FBI. Maybe you knew that.
I thought you said you had photos.
well, special agent bonder, here, works for the FBI.
he does a little moonlighting, though.
he works for someone else too.
yeah? Who's that?
Roman Nabokov. I know you know him.
I know you wanted him.
and I know that bonder took him away.
bodner works for Roman.
was the Dunlop killing a Hazlit copycat?
we're pursuing all leads.
wow, looks like the leak got bigger.
bet their business is booming.
at this point in time, I would ask for your patience and allow us to do our job. Thank you.
you fail to mention the victim was found buried up to his neck, or that there were flowers found scattered around the body, just like Johnny Hazlit used to do it.
Yes, I failed to mention that.
you failed to mention that the victim was found near the home of Flint Garber, 1818 Vista Vierra.
Yeah, failed to mention that. Also failed to mention something else.
what's that? - You're under arrest.
Yeah, okay. One more thing:
flint Garber and Maude Paxton were the children of Johnny Hazlit.
there's a grandson too, Clifton.
a house full of Hazlits around the block from the murder.
come on, that's enough.
that Frank Dunlop's body was buried up to the neck is a detail that didn't go to the press.
we keep certain facts to ourselves.
then the only people who know those facts are us cops, or the killer.
come on, lap leaks like a sieve.
where do you think we get most of our information from?
maybe it was a tribute murder.
or a copycat. There's a difference.
it's subtle, but it's there.
you should teach a class.
Hey, maybe we could get your partner to give a guest lecture.
what do you think, Squeaky, should we do it?
actually, I do know the difference between copycat and tribute.
detail I picked up at lamomam.
let me see if I get this right.
Hazlit left flowers by his kills.
now, if Frank Dunlop's body had had flowers surrounding it, - that would been a copycat, yes? - Yes.
but Frank Dunlop's body the way it was found?
it was a flower that someone left for Hazlit, and that's a tribute.
okay, Hazlit didn't like people who lied or broke promises to him.
Frank Dunlop ever break any promises to you?
we didn't know Frank Dunlop.
we just find Hazlit fascinating.
like the rest of the world. Like you two.
well, we'll be less fascinated once we find Frank Dunlop's killer.
maybe you won't be able to.
maybe you'll always find him fascinating.
Oh, like a song you can't get out of your head?
Yeah, man. Like that.
do you have alibis for the night Frank Dunlop was killed?
at an auction for hillside strangler items.
we were both there.
are we suspects now?
do you wanna be?
that'll be good for ticket sales.
we'll check out your alibi.
if it all pans out, you get to go home.
take your time.
auction house employees saw Squeaky and Tex that night.
but it was, in their words, "a mob scene for all that hillside strangler swag."
I'm not sure I understand a world where that stuff sells at auctions.
well, they got what they wanted. Publicity.
Bobby! - On it!
coming through! Move it! Move!
I always wanted to know what a Hazlit tasted like.
meet Clifton Hazlit, Johnny Hazlit's grandson.
come on. Make a lane! Make a lane! Make a lane!
I look just like Hazlit, don't I?
all my life, I thought there was something wrong with me.
turns out there is.
the man you hit isn't gonna press charges.
they exposed me, what happens to them?
I should done what my grandfather would've.
what's that?
made them pay in blood.
Clifton? You're no different than you were before you found out.
Oh, I'm different. You heard her.
now I'm Johnny Hazlit's grandson.
all right, well, you know, we can let you out the back.
why the back?
because those photographers, they're waiting for you out front.
Hello? - Who is this?
this is Charles Crews. Who is this?
I was looking for Olivia.
I thought I dialed her cell phone.
you dialed the house.
she's out trying on her wedding dress for the 10, 000th time.
you want me to leave her a message for you?
uh, tell her... somebody called.
somebody? What the
somebody? Somebody called?
Oh, great.
red light? Did I run it?
license and registration.
you know why we pulled you over, Mr. Earley?
I blew through that light.
I'm gonna run these.
gun!
show me your hands!
out of the car.
on your knees.
I'm sorry, I have a friend on the force.
on your knees.
found this next to the gun.
that is not mine. Not the gun, not whatever's in that baggie.
Oh, guys. Guys, please. I'm--I'm on parole.
Maude Paxton-Hazlit and Flint Garber-Hazlit alibi each other.
so they both did it, or they both didn't do it?
what about the guns found out at the house?
none of them match the bullets found in Frank Dunlop.
we're running 'Them down to see if they match up to any other crimes.
squeaky and Tex?
they alibi each other too.
so they both did it or they both didn't do it.
what about the grandson, young Clifton?
he was with his girlfriend.
or maybe not.
Mindy! Is it true you're in a relationship with Clifton Garber?
that is not true.
didn't you tell the police you were in a relationship with Johnny Hazlit's grandson?
no.
your father?
he get you to say what you did to those reporters?
I'm sorry if I wasted your time.
you're withdrawing your statement?
a man was killed, Mindy. A man you knew.
what did you call him? A saint?
Clifton asked me to cover for him and I did.
we weren't having a relationship.
I only knew him from the food bank.
I wasn't having a relationship with Clifton Garber.
it was a mistake and I'm sorry.
wow, what do you think, detective Crews?
I think that's a nice speech.
did you write it, or did your dad?
I have to go now.
you like Clifton?
cause he's not from your world.
he's not your dad over there.
he drives for people like your dad.
Mindy, are you recanting because you really weren't with Clifton?
or is it because it turns out the man you were with is a Hazlit?
I wasn't with Clifton.
you're looking at obstruction of justice.
do you understand that?
my father said his lawyers will call you about that. I have to go.
do you believe her? - Nope.
her dad finds out his daughter is linked to a Hazlit, and Clifton Garber loses his alibi.
Yeah.
it's a weird thing to hold against somebody.
what? - Their blood.
Yep. We'll be right there.
Lamomam, shots fired.
is he dead, is Tex dead?
did you see who it was?
Yeah. I did. He was here.
who was here?
Hazlit. It was Johnny Hazlit.
I heard the gun and I turned.
Tex was on the ground.
and then I saw him.
you saw Johnny Hazlit with the gun?
I saw the gun.
it looked bigger in his hands, bu--but it was his hand.
it was Johnny Hazlit.
he shot Tex, and then he shot me, and then he dropped the gun and ran.
Squeaky, sometimes when you see a gun like that, that's all you see.
it confuses everything else.
I wasn't confused. It was Johnny.
he was here. I saw him.
but he ran.
well, we know Johnny Hazlit didn't do it.
cause he's dead?
let's get some gunshot residue tests done on Squeaky and Tex hurry.
Yeah. Only one of them is dead, but both of them are crazy.
maybe she did see Johnny Hazlit.
that would be the crazy part.
what if you found out there was something in your blood that you didn't know was there?
the guy I hit? That museum freak.
that's right. The museum that exposed you as a Hazlit.
you think I killed that grebe.
like you said, it's what your grandfather would done.
you have good reason.
yeah? I also have an alibi.
I been here all night.
and so have they.
and they're not gonna recant like Mindy.
Yeah! All right.
Nope, they like me for who I am.
Yeah. Everywhere I go, they go.
wanna take a picture with me?
no? Okay.
you live in this limo cause you don't wanna go home.
I'd rather never step foot back in that house again.
but you can't afford anywhere else.
that's right. - Because this limo took all your cash.
which is why you moved home in the first place.
Yeah. Limo took all my cash.
so if you don't have any money, who pays the mortgage on that house?
dad, I guess.
with what? Did flint ever have a job?
dad never worked a day in his life.
gunshot residue test on Squeaky and Tex came back negative.
Thanks, Bobby.
you don't work. We checked.
you don't collect social security.
would've had to use your real name for that?
so how do you pay the mortgage, Flint?
and the utilities?
you sell some of your stuff?
it's valuable stuff. It's my legacy.
it all belonged to Johnny Hazlit.
that's right. - Who bought it?
collectors overseas.
do you know Squeaky and Tex Uhry?
they made me a couple of lowball offers.
didn't have any cash.
they couldn't match those foreign offers.
did Frank know the hurry's?
I told him not to sell to them.
go for that foreign money.
why would Frank sell anything? It's all your stuff.
Mindy said Frank told her he found a way to raise a lot of money.
flint, did you give anything to Frank?
all of it.
so he could sell it?
Frank would just used it for charity.
Frank listened to me.
and he said that he could do good things with that money.
and that...
and that would make you good.
but I told him to stick with the foreign buyers.
detectives.
that's the gun found at the museum.
Yeah, the one that shot Squeaky and Tex.
ballistics confirmed that.
and that gun there matches the slugs pulled from Frank Dunlop.
what?
we pulled some prints off the grip. We got a match.
guess who.
but he's been dead for over 30 years.
provenance.
Hazlit's back!!
we're sorry for your loss.
Tex would've wanted this.
why'd you kill Frank Dunlop?
I didn't kill Frank Dunlop.
Frank was told not to sell to you.
all that sweet Hazlit swag going overseas where they get a better price.
is that why you killed him?
then making him look like this?
that's just good for business.
it really paid off.
Tex and I were at that auction.
you know, that auction was so crowded, you and Tex could've left, and no one would've even noticed.
that's what we call a "soft alibi."
why'd you kill Tex, Squeaky?
I didn't kill Tex.
he get nervous about that "soft alibi" ?
I don't know who killed Frank Dunlop.
but Johnny Hazlit killed Tex.
he was here, I saw him.
Johnny Hazlit is dead.
it says so right on that exhibit.
the person who owned Hazlit's gun, that's who killed Tex.
tracked the money order of yours, Squeaky.
$15, 000 last month to japan.
you know, that's a lot of money to spend on a gun.
but I guess you have to spend money to make money.
checked your bank. That was every last penny you had.
you owned that gun. Why didn't you exhibit it?
cause you were using it.
what's that word, Crews? - Provenance.
that was Hazlit. He was here, I saw him!
that gun has his prints!
guess she's working on her insanity defense.
maybe it was Hazlit back from the dead.
or maybe Squeaky and Tex were wearing gloves.
if those gloves were part of the murder, you'd have to put them on display.
because she knew they were real. - Crews?
Charlie! - Let's get outtalk here.
Yeah. Let's get out here.
you run a lean operation here.
plenty of fresh produce, though, foundation of any good meal.
Where's Rachel? Your niece?
she's not my niece.
I know who that girl is, detective.
she went out. Some musician-type called on her. Not my type.
I wouldn't let him near my daughters.
Where's Ted? - Ted.
we'll get to that in a moment.
what did Mickey Rayborn say to you?
that's between me and him.
I thought that'd be your answer.
detective, what did I tell you would happen if you went after ray born?
I told you you'd go back to jail.
but I'm not in jail.
you'll get to Ted in a moment?
I'd like that moment to be now.
we did some thinking back at our thinking room, and on reflection, threatening you with jail might not be that much of a threat.
you wanna try this?
I'm good. - You sure?
I got it right where I want it.
Where's ted?
probably still out at county.
but I'd say he'd be at supermax by noon tomorrow.
you can't drive around with a gun and coke.
you know ted can't hack another stretch.
you went after ray born, and you got in.
now you gonna stay in and do what we tell you.
you make sure that stay at a simmer, and run a spoon through it every once in a while.
we are nowhere.
we are nowhere.
you can't be nowhere...
because to be... - Crews.
you have to be... - Crews.
somewhere.
you can't be nowhere.
we are nowhere...
with the shooting, your shooting.
ballistics? - Clean.
whoever did it was in the car by the time I got to the door.
what about the car?
stolen.
found it wiped clean.
crews, you were looking... right at whoever did it.
you can't remember?
okay, you answered the door...
and then?
and then I got shot.
what about the person with the gun?
nothing.
Really? I thought there couldn't be nothing.
you want to come in?
eight Weeks Later here you are.
here you are.
it's an unusual request, detective.
most people wouldn't want to have the bullet that shot them.
well, someone gave it to me.
it'd be rude just to throw it away.
you fit for duty? - I am fit for duty.
you want to go catch a killer?
I thought you'd never ask.
how come this is LAPD and not FAA?
I guess this is why.
think he shot himself?
if he did, why'd he land the plane?
why didn't he just let go?
no gun anywhere in here.
pilot's license I. D.'S him as William Ellis.
the late William Ellis has one entry wound to his right side.
got a bunch of witnesses out here. They all say the same thing.
the plane makes a hard landing. They run up.
the pilot's all alone in the plane.
he looks at them and dies.
there's no one else in the plane. - And no gun.
so someone shoots him before he takes off?
or someone shoots him in the air.
and jumps?
or William Ellis here shoots himself and then tosses the gun out.
I'll call the airfield, check if he was alone when he took off.
I'll see if the fava has a flight path, find out where he was going.
Hey, Reese?
he look familiar to you?
Yeah, but I can't figure out why.
william Ellis-- Guess where he used to work.
in the circus. - No.
why would you say the circus?
you told me to guess.
crews. - I'll tell you.
in space. William "bull" Ellis was a shuttle pilot.
he went up there three times.
Ellis retires from NASA in 1993.
he starts a company that makes parts for rocket engines, and he gets rich.
he came down in that plane alone? - Yep.
the field where he took off from was private. No control tower.
he logged out alone, but there was no one there to verify that.
where was he headed?
flight wasn't logged in. The FAA doesn't track planes that small.
I know him. He looks familiar.
he's been on the news.
he's going back into space.
he was gonna pay the Russians $35 million to take him back up.
$35 million. Okay.
a rich man gets shot dead. Who benefits?
uh, he's got a wife that died ten years ago and, uh, one kid.
we're on our way now to go talk to him.
detective, a moment.
not you, detective. You, detective.
don't you usually kiss Reese when you call her back like this?
I got something else in mind for you.
don't remember who shot you?
just a blank space there.
okay, just so you know, I don't buy it.
someone shoots me, that's not someone I'm gonna forget.
well... like I said, captain, there
there's just a blank space there.
dad called this morning.
said he was taking the plane up for a couple hours and wanted to see me in the office when he came down.
you work for your father, Dean?
Yeah, the head of expended resource control and distribution.
can you think of anybody who'd want to harm him?
harm him? No. Everybody loved him.
the president called, said the nation had lost a shining light.
Dean, we need to ask you where you were this morning.
with some friends here at work.
you... you want to talk to them?
Oh, it's just procedure.
he goes back into space at his age--that doesn't worry you at all?
dad needed to fly.
hours alone in his plane, climbed k2 last year.
if dad wanted to go back into space, dad was going back into space.
pretty expensive trip, huh?
$35 million.
did he have that kind of money?
dad was selling the company to pay for his next trip up there.
selling it for how much?
a lot, I guess.
william Ellis spends 15 years building up this company, and then he sells it for two weeks in space?
he had been up there before.
he knew what he was paying for.
I guess he thought it was worth it.
could you imagine seeing the world from up there?
the earth is floating.
you are floating. Everything is floating.
I hear there's a lot of barfing and you crap into a vacuum.
Yeah, a floating vacuum.
a floating vacuum?
you don't even know what that means.
it's space talk.
we joined NASA together, trained together, flew together.
we retired within months of each other.
when bill opened up this shop...
I came on board.
as an employee?
you're checking up on me. Yes, as an employee.
Mr. Breem, Bill Ellis was selling this business.
what's that leave you with?
that leaves me with having worked for Bill Ellis for the last 15 years.
that leaves me with time to get back in the cockpit where I belong.
I never wanted to be a businessman. I'm--I'm a flyer.
so you worked for him because...
because "bull" asked me to.
did "bull" have any enemies?
no, no. Everyone loved "bull."
the president called this morning.
is it possible he took his own life?
we all get a little depressed at this age.
one foot in the grave, another on a banana peel.
but to be honest with you, for folks like us, it's worse.
to be down here and not up there?
that's exactly right.
but bill was going back. He...
he was going back up.
what's it like? To be up there?
it's like...
like going back where I came from.
like going back where I came from.
a lot of the astronauts turn to poetry.
the spacemen poets.
we're gonna have to ask-- where were you this morning?
I was fishing at Castaic.
detectives, you will find out who did this, won't you?
Mr. Breem, how much was Bill Ellis selling his company for?
$30 million.
the trip back up costs $35 million. Where was the rest coming from?
his savings.
how much of his savings?
well, all of it.
can you point us toward his son Dean's office?
he pays for that trip, the kid gets no inheritance.
how come everyone says the president called?
well, people like to think that they will be remembered after they're gone.
you know, that their lives have made an impact.
after I got shot, you thought about me, didn't you?
come on. You did, admit it.
Y-ye--yes, Crews, I thought about you.
about what it would be like if I, you know, floated away, how empty your life would be.
Reese with no Crews.
Hey, when I was unconscious...
the, uh... the president didn't call me, did he?
no. He didn't call.
you'd tell me if he did, though.
I mean, you'd--you'd make sure I got that message?
model planes.
you were flying model planes yesterday?
we're a club.
and where do you fly these planes?
desert.
wind currents are primo.
I have a Fokker.
excuse me?
a Fokker.
it's vintage. It's what the red baron flew.
a model of what the red baron flew.
you're all out there together?
we meet once a week.
once a week.
or when the currents are primo.
and what do you fly?
sr-71 blackbird.
that alibi seem rehearsed to you?
Dean's dad flew rockets.
Dean flies model airplanes.
his dad knew the president.
he knows them.
his dad owns this company, but...
makes Dean work in that closet.
his dad sells the company...
and Dean is left with nothing.
was there something else?
Dean said his job is expended resource control and distribution.
can you tell us what that means?
waste removal.
his father made him take out the garbage.
paid him minimum wage too.
said he had to start at the bottom.
Dean's father flew high.
I guess Dean gets high too.
how's your injury?
100%. Why?
you want to kick in a door?
what the hell is it?
I have no idea.
you ever seen anything like it?
Nope. You?
Nope. You?
Nope.
What'd those kids say?
nothing without a lawyer.
maybe Dean's father caught Dean dealing, so Dean killed him.
dealing, but... dealing what?
I've never seen anything like it.
Reese, remember those guys who came to buy?
what did they have in comn?
they drove nice cars.
no. They drove race cars.
not sure I'd go and do that.
race cars.
anyone got a light?
not sure if I'd go and do that either.
Dean worked at a rocket plant.
all right, let's talk about scarcity of resources.
the less there is of something, the more it is worth.
like innocent men in here.
no, baby.
we're all innocent in here.
actually, I am innocent this time.
last time I-I did it.
I did what they said. But, uh, this time, uh...
I am innocent.
then you're the scarce resource.
Charlie Crews says hang tough, Mr. Earley.
it won't be much longer.
solid rocket fuel.
no wonder our hazmat guy couldn't I. D. it.
you need security clearance to get your hands on that stuff.
or a dad in the business.
those street racers put this in there cars
man, oh, man, are they going somewhere fast, huh?
your dad flew jets in the navy?
carrier landings at night.
takes a real man to do that.
flew those three shuttle missions too.
I looked it up and--oh, wait, maybe you know this too.
how fast your dad was going when he flew up there.
17, 000 miles per hour.
did you hear that, Reese?
bill Ellis was flying through space at 17, 000 miles per hour.
your dad's a spaceman, and there you are with your toy airplanes.
model.
okay, toy model.
and taking the company trash out, stealing your father's fuel-- that make you popular?
it make you cool? - Make you money, Dean?
bull Ellis find out you were ripping him off?
is that what he wanted to talk to you about?
we're pretty sure you were not flying model airplanes when your dad got shot, Dean.
I was selling fuel in Pomona.
had breakfast at the diner. Flirted with the waitress. She'll remember.
Oh, it went that well, huh?
not very smart still working this with us cops snooping around, Dean.
biggest race of the year.
I had obligations. I didn't kill my father.
if you didn't do it, who did?
don't you want to know who did it, Dean?
his fly buddy Mick Breem wants to know. We want to know. The president wants to know.
but you, Dean, how--how come you don't want to know?
or are you not asking who it is because...
you know who it was?
who killed your father, Dean?
since last year, he, uh...
he spent too much time alone in his plane.
he loved that company, and he was selling it.
to go back into space.
what was he gonna do up there?
you didn't think he was coming back?
my partner here thinks he took his own life.
is that what you think?
did he ever talk to you about this?
dad never spoke to me about himself.
never spoke to me.
like a man?
because you didn't fly.
I'm afraid of heights.
Dean said his father changed his behavior about a year ago.
something happen then?
bill Ellis was a hero.
it's our job to find Mr. Ellis' killer...
even if the killer is Mr. Ellis himself.
now, did something happen a year ago?
k2.
bill climbed regularly, several peaks a year.
last year he ascended k2.
when he came back, he had changed.
something happen on that mountain?
I don't know.
but he came back down off that mountain, put that pick up on that shelf there.
he never climbed again.
what is that?
you don't know what this is?
this is a Buddhist mourning flag.
it's got some English writing on it.
flag for the dead?
someone died during that trip up k2.
who else was on that climb?
bill only ever climbed with one other man-- Evan Tucker.
it was just the two of them on k2.
Evan Tucker come back?
Yes. Bill and Tucker both came down off that mountain.
so who died up there?
what's going on?
I don't know. You tell me.
didn't you call me in here?
I called you in here, both of you.
I got a problem.
maybe you two don't want me here for this.
stow it, Stark.
now, I have an unsolved shooting of a police officer, my police officer, and I've got a witness who's not talking.
Charlie says he doesn't remember who shot him. It happens.
did I say it was a good time to talk?
now, you are his old partner, and you're his current partner.
so I want to ask you two a question.
I don't think I like being questioned in this room.
why wouldn't Crews tell us who shot him?
why would he keep that to himself?
what's he doing?
when I wish to forgive another, what do I mean?
I mean I wish to forgive myself.
when I wish to harm another, what do I mean?
I mean I wish to harm myself.
close your eyes and think of the world as seen from space.
from that distance, it is calm...
silent...
at peace...
one.
calm, silent...
at peace...
one.
because of a paper flag?
paper mourning flag.
if Ellis had it made, someone died up there.
we checked with the k2 base camp station there were no reported fatalities during the time that Ellis and Tucker were up on that mountain.
you see that flag, you think there was an unreported fatality.
Ellis and Tucker both went up that mountain. Ellis and Tucker both came down.
Evan Tucker is not fortune 500.
Tucker's a manager at sporty mart.
how did he know William Ellis?
Tucker only works half the year to pay for the six months he spends on the global adventure circuit.
that's how he met Ellis.
according to Breem, they just became real close.
they only climbed with each other--a club of two.
you two talk to Tucker.
find out who didn't come down off that mountain.
thank you. - Thank you.
you go first.
okay, okay, I'll go first.
that was Tucker's kid.
says her dad has been on a company retreat for the last week-- backwoods, no phones.
okay. That was the assistant manager from sporty mart.
she says that Tucker has been on a family vacation for the last week
backwoods, no phones.
both Ellis and Tucker knew who died on that mountain.
but now Ellis is dead and...
Tucker's been missing for a week.
Hi, this is detective Crews. Your mom around?
Hi, Mrs. Tucker, this is detective Crews, LAPD.
we're investigating the death of Bill Ellis.
we know that your husband climbed k2 with him last year.
were there any fatalities on that trip?
did someone die up there?
okay, well, then maybe you'd like to come down here and talk about that.
Tucker's wife says there was a death up there.
does she know who it was?
well, did she tell you?
Tucker's wife says Tucker died.
you saw your husband last week.
Yes.
but you told my partner on the phone that he died up on k2.
he did.
how did he die, Mrs. Tucker?
william Ellis killed him.
his body isn't dead, is it, Mrs. Tucker?
he's just not the same man that went up that mountain, is he?
my husband and William Ellis were at 12, 000 feet, tethered together.
my husband lost his footing, and went over the edge.
he was pulling Ellis down.
Ellis cut the rope.
and Evan fell...
hundreds of feet.
he fell...
all alone and falling.
but he didn't die. - Nope.
uh, angles of slope, drift density, wind speed
he was barely bruised.
Ellis, the hero, cut the rope.
Ellis let my husband fall.
do you know where your husband is?
where were you when Ellis died?
alone with our children.
I'm always alone with our children since he came down off that mountain.
Mrs. Tucker, do you think your husband could've killed Ellis?
no. But I'm glad someone did.
Ellis cuts the rope...
Tucker falls to his death, but doesn't die.
and Ellis needs to go back into space.
thanks so much.
got a little more information from the assistant manager where Tucker worked.
since he'd come back from k2, he'd become less interested in all the sports he usually did, and he focused on just one sport.
did she say what it was?
she did.
was it skydiving?
we're looking for someone who could've shot Ellis, then jumped out of that plane, and our lead suspect has a sudden interest in skydiving.
ran a credit-card check on Tucker.
we got a hit at a Perris motel.
Paris, France?
Perris, California-- skydiving capital of America.
Tucker's credit statements show that he's been out there on and off for the last year.
since k2.
then you two head out to perris.
uh, captain? A word.
this isn't the part where you kiss me, is it?
don't you ever call me into that interrogation room again.
and if you have a question for my partner, then you ask my partner.
I just wanted to find out who shot him, because he's one of my cops and because you were there.
maybe next time you get hit too.
don't you ever call me into that interrogation room again.
okay, you asked about debt. Let's talk about debt.
simply put, debt is anything that you owe.
now, can anybody give me an example?
I still owe you a beating.
Oh, you mean because of that bun I took from you?
Yeah, because of that bun they let you take from me.
Ah, uh-uh, it's okay. It's okay. Okay.
Yeah, you, uh, you still owe me a beating.
Yeah, but I guess those babysitters Charlie Crews sent are gonna keep you from collecting that beating, huh?
you don't have to do this.
Yeah, I do.
it's okay. The guards will break it up.
not quick enough.
okay, white collar, let's get it on.
we're looking for Evan Tucker.
Tucker? He's around here someplace.
you're cops. Is he in trouble?
we just need to talk to him.
he just went to jump. He should be back in half an hour.
tuck been coming here long?
about a year. He started as a student.
now he's as good as any of the instructors.
tuck is fearless.
that a record of the students' jumps?
Yeah, heights, pull times.
tuck on that board?
he's there somewhere.
Ellis' plane was flying at about 8, 000 feet.
let's see if Tucker was training to jump from that height.
I want to jump out of a plane.
be a part of the air and one with the sky?
no, I just want to jump out of a plane.
Tucker's jumps over the last month.
look at this.
he was waiting longer and longer before he pulled the cord.
he was getting closer and closer to the ground.
you want to jump out of a plane, and you don't want to be seen?
then you wait as long as possible before opening your chute.
Tucker was training to jump out of a plane without being seen.
don't you need a warrant for that?
maybe. - Maybe not.
is this Tucker's only chute?
what is he doing on a plane without a chute?
Hey, which plane is Tucker in?
that one.
he's fearless, huh?
Yeah, tuck sure is fearless.
were you always that way?
or was it just because what happened to you and Ellis up on that mountain?
Fearless?
you touch death, and all that fear just goes away, right?
it's time for me to fall.
Evan Tucker, on your knees.
it's time for me to fall!
on your knees now!
a Buddhist flag for the dead.
how'd you know what happens when you touch death?
detective Crews.
got something that belongs to you.
that bullet was yours. The next is mine.
make the call.
what call?
the call that gets Ted Earley out of prison.
there, it's done.
what was that?
text message.
the call isn't even a call anymore? It's a text?
I'm never catching up.
how much did Roman pay you to shoot me?
you think it's about the money.
Roman uses people's weaknesses.
Where's your family, agent Bodner?
I sent them away.
because you're afraid of what Roman will do to them?
Roman Nevikov came to my house.
I come home, he's drinking tea with my wife.
my daughter is on Roman's knee.
I sent them away.
call me after your leg heals.
and don't throw that bullet away.
found this when we searched your perris motel room, Tucker.
ballistics matched it to the gun that killed William Ellis.
you remember him, don't you?
will Ellis cut your rope.
william Ellis let you fall.
is that why you killed him?
you wouldn't understand.
we understand you went up without a chute today.
Tucker, you feeling guilty about Ellis?
you wouldn't understand.
not that we blame you.
anybody would want to do that to someone who did what Ellis did to you.
what William Ellis did is show me the face of god.
the face of...Of god.
what did it look like, Tucker?
it was beautiful.
like...
the sun coming closer...
blinding me, but I could still see everything.
Tucker, you didn't hate William Ellis, did you?
why would I?
because he cut your rope.
no, I had to beg him to do it.
we were both going over. I told him to cut the rope. He didn't want to do it.
he didn't want to do it. I had to beg him.
and then you fell.
but now Ellis is dead.
no, he's not dead.
just went back where he came from.
what was that, Tucker?
just went back where he came from.
that's what Ellis used to say.
about going back into space.
what?
it's like going back where he came from?
that's what Breem said about being in space.
that's what Tucker said Ellis said about being in space.
well, maybe they were both spacemen poets, Crews.
and they both wrote the same poem?
maybe one's a poet, and one's a liar.
you think NASA has a listed telephone number?
it's a government agency.
our tax dollars at work. I'll bet they got a listed phone number.
Yes!
need the number for NASA.
checked with NASA.
Mick Breem never actually went into space.
he trained with Ellis, but he was an alternate.
he never went up there.
he padded his resume. I don't think that makes him a killer.
and you got the guy with the gun, right?
what? You don't think Tucker did it?
because...
because he saw the face of god.
saw the face of... yeah.
we had a guy once in Manhattan south who saw the virgin Mary on a grilled cheese sandwich.
killed seven people with a tire iron over the course of the week.
Tucker didn't mention grilled cheese.
is this about him nearly dying and you nearly dying?
Nope. I don't think it is.
at least Tucker remembers who cut his rope.
finally got the financials on Ellis propulsion.
they just unsealed his will.
guess who William Ellis left his company to.
Dean, how come you didn't tell us you weren't getting your father's company?
what? I'm not getting the company?
Mick Breem is getting the company. - What?
Mick Breem is getting the company?
well, yeah, I guess.
Oh, well, yeah, you guess?
you guess what, Dean?
I guess that makes sense.
dad always said, "the right person for the right job" .
I guess dad knew that wasn't me.
did Mick Breem kill my father?
if your father lived, Breem gets nothing.
when he died, Breem got the company.
because Mick Breem is the right person for the job.
we're the wrong people for this job.
excuse me. Excuse me.
watch out. Coming through.
but it's not a plane. - I know that.
but let's just say it is. Let's just say this is the plane William Ellis died in.
Breem and Ellis were both NASA trained. It's what made them.
okay, I understand that, but why are you and Tucker sitting like that?
it's the plane William died in.
Breem isn't gonna tell us how he did it.
how would Ellis do it?
Ellis is dead. - Ellis is dead.
it's the plane Ellis died in.
they both went through NASA, did things the same way.
if we knew how Ellis would've done it, maybe we can figure out how Breem did it.
Oh, not you too.
if Ellis were gonna do this-- kill a man and then jump from that plane
how would he have done it?
it's the plane Ellis died in.
william "bull" Ellis was NASA.
he said everything in life was a mission.
and for a mission, you have to train.
so how did Breem train?
and where would he do it?
let's start faxing his picture around, shall we?
I have a captain Tidwell on line one.
Mr. Breem, captain Kevin Tidwell, LAPD.
what can I do for you, captain?
tracked down that charter pilot you used Nevada, out of state, nice.
used? Used for what?
to train--once a week for the last two months.
training to...
jump from a small plane at 8, 000 feet-- the cruising altitude of William Ellis' plane.
you used a different name, so we faxed your picture to the airfields in four states.
one of them puts your face to the fake name.
and once we have that name, we get you buying that gun there in Nevada.
the gun you planted on Tucker.
william Ellis sells his company, goes up into space, you get nothing.
william Ellis dies, you get it all.
you never actually went up into space.
I never actually did.
well, think of it this way, Mr. Breem
that now you get to go someplace Bill Ellis never got to go.
okay, you don't remember who shot you.
anything else you don't remember about that day?
if I don't remember it, how would I know if I remembered or not?
unless I forgot to remember.
crews, you know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I remember you asking me a question about your father having something to do with me going to jail.
you still want to know the answer?
yeah... I do.
your father wasn't responsible for me going to jail.
I was teaching a class on the, uh, nature of debt.
we had a discussion.
where do you want to go?
anywhere else.
fast.
well, that, Ted...
will not be a problem.
and think of the world as seen from space.
from that distance, it is calm, silent, at peace...
one.
did you try turning it on and off?
the phone or the car?
the phone, sir. - Yes.
is it a new phone? - No.
it is a new car? - No. Yes. No.
no, I mean, it used to be my car, then I-I gave it to this girl.
and then I got another car, but then I wanTed this car back because the other one was full of bullet holes, and people kept telling me I shouldn't be driving a car full of bullet holes.
so I bought this one back, but she painTed flowers on it.
I had the flowers taken off. Now the phone won't sync up.
have you made sure that you have correctly entered your personal pin number?
can I ask you a question? Where exactly are you?
I'm sorry, sir. We are not allowed to talk about our personal lives.
you're very far away, aren't you?
because I'm looking at los angeles, and I have the feeling that you are the other side of the world, looking at things that I could only imagine.
could that be true?
I am looking at my computer, sir.
please describe your service problem to me exactly.
my phone is supposed to sync up with my car, so I can talk hands-free.
it's against the law for me to hold my phone while I'm driving, and I would hate to break the law, because I'm
I'm kind of a cop.
kind of?
I would think that either you are a cop or you're not a cop.
I'm a cop.
neighbors heard the same cd playing for ten hours straight.
they called the landlord.
the landlord comes in, and he sees this.
Where's the landlord now?
under heavy sedation.
did he say anything?
he said, "man on a stick."
looks like poison, too.
I'm guessing antifreeze.
taste of the wine might've covered it up.
Yeah.
he drinks the wine...
someone watches him stumble across the room.
and then someone pins him to the wall.
man on a stick.
bleach and ammonia...
make chlorine.
antifreeze in the wine and a broken broom handle.
Yeah, things found around the house.
Jerome Rafts-- financial advisor.
risk acquisitions-- derivatives.
maybe Jerome mishandled someone's money.
I don't think we're getting anything off that computer.
you get ripped off, you bring a gun or a pipe.
Oh, yeah, a pipe is good.
then you can feel it, you know, when the bone breaks.
too much information?
Hey, Reese, look at this.
Oh, Jerome liked to date.
there's a different woman in each of these photos.
well, maybe one of the women didn't like sharing Jerome.
for that, I could see using antifreeze, bleach...
ammonia and a broom handle.
Jerome sure looks happy, though.
I'm' looking at Jerome. He doesn't look too happy.
man on a stick.
Reese, something else-- there was a..
there was what?
a bird. A pigeon.
it flew against the window, tried to get in.
that means something, right?
a bird in the house after a death?
I hate birds. - I hate birds.
you, keep doing what you're doing. Come with me.
FBI called this morning.
they want to borrow a few lapd detectives for a joint organized-crime task force.
I think you should do it.
you'd be on loan, still lapd, for a few weeks here in L. A.
looks great on the resume when you want to move up the ladder, which you do.
when do I have to tell them?
they need you there today. - Well, what about the case?
the vic has a shelf full of girlfriends and a broom handle through and through.
it's done. He'll be fine.
you should do this.
it's a new situation for you.
I want you think of it like you're building a building.
you got to put in a good foundation, or everything you do after that is just gonna come tumbling down.
I'll see you in a few weeks, Crews.
okay, but remember what I said-- good foundation right away.
everything else after that is just a waste.
and you got that speech in...
kindergarten. But it's a good speech.
it's--it's the foundation speech.
Oh, they grow up so fast, don't they?
found this in the closet.
wireless computer backup.
everything on Jerome Rafts' computers will be on here.
Reese usually starts.
maybe you could
why don't I just jump in?
Jerome Rafts, 38 years old, moved from North Dakota nine years ago, works at home.
he's a financial advisor specializing in derivative do you know what a derivative is?
a derivative is when you don't invest in a thing, but you kind of invest in a thing like the thing you're investing in.
Yeah, me neither.
tech guys couldn't bust open security on his business files, so we don't know his clients yet.
who are the girlfriends?
they're not exactly girlfriends.
tech did find a file on each of them in Jerome Rafts' computer
hours spent with each girl at a cost of $400 per hour.
eight hours with Veronica-- $3, 200.
four hours with Harper-- $1, 600.
13 hours with Trish-- $4, 800.
$4, 800 only gets you 12 hours.
I guess the 13th hour's free, like doughnuts.
but the winner is Alexa-- $9, 600 over the last month.
what kind of guy displays photos of himself with escorts like they were his girlfriends?
he's a financial advisor.
you know, his world is money.
you know, just because he paid for his relationships, didn't make them any less real.
don't you think this is weird?
you know, just us two without Reese?
let's just keep the ball moving. Did Rafts have date last night?
Yeah, with Alexa.
anything on the security cameras?
we got this.
doesn't live in the building, wasn't a guest of anyone in the building.
but she's looking down and away from the camera. Could be anyone.
what did you do to that woman, pal, that she'd do that to you?
phone numbers on any of the girls?
we dumped Rafts' phone, didn't find any calls to the women.
we did find one call he made repeaTedly to a woman named Brenda Trill.
every time Rafts called Trill, Rafts had a date.
Brenda Trill's the madam. - I'm on my way to check her out now.
I guess you'll need someone to fill in for Reese while she's gone.
captain, we--we both might need someone to fill in for Reese, and, um,
I want you to know you can, uh, you can always talk to me.
anything you-- you want to talk about?
I'll go talk to the madam, then.
I-I know this doesn't make me detective.
I'm still just a patrolman in a cheap suit.
I'm happy to have you in the car.
Charlie, I wasn't exactly there for you the last time we partnered, so...
Hey, you want me out of this car, I am out.
Bobby, I requesTed you.
I prayed for this. I'm not ashamed to say, prayed...
for you and me to be in a car again.
I'm guessing you prayed for other things.
Yeah, I did-- other things.
that dead guy sure did like the pros, though, huh? All that money.
Yeah, don't think Jerome Rafts had much else in his life.
seems like the relationships he paid for were the only ones he had.
that's so wrong. You don't pay a pro to stay. You pay her to leave.
Charlie Sheen said that.
Jerome Rafts-- financial advisor.
risk acquisitions-- derivatives.
do you know what a derivative is?
sure, it's the kind of investment where you're really not, um...
well, it's--it's--it's-- it's when you're, uh... no. No, no idea.
Yes, I-I know what a derivative is.
it's--it's-- it's kind of hard to explain to a layperson.
to a layperson, Ted? Are you saying I wouldn't understand it?
no, I'm saying it's complicated.
okay, a derivative is a financial product whose value is derived from the value of something else, the underlying.
now, because the value of the derivative is contingent on the value of the underlying, the notional value of derivatives is recorded off the balance sheet, while the market value of derivatives is recorded on the balance sheet.
I don't understand it.
don't feel bad. No one does.
uh, why do you need to know?
I got a dead financial advisor, specialized in derivatives.
how broke was he?
don't think he was broke. Why?
well, the derivative bubble burst.
if the guy had money, it was from somewhere else.
it came from somewhere else?
are you Ted Earley? - Yes.
and you are? - Amanda.
how can I help you, Amanda?
well, actually, I'm interested in taking your class, you know, going back to school and all that.
would it be all right if I asked you some questions?
what's that going through him?
a broom handle.
he was with a girl named Alexa last night.
that's right--Alexa.
can we talk to her? - You can try.
when she didn't check in after her date, I called her cell.
it was no longer in service.
do you have her address, then?
I don't know where any of my girls live, for their own safety.
are any of these Alexa?
no.
do you have a photo of her?
you mean like on her company I. D?
I guess not.
we're gonna want you to talk to a sketch artist.
Bobby... do you have a question you'd like to ask of Miss Trill?
Yeah. Uh, sure, okay, uh...
uh, let me see, uh...
do you know who killed Jerome Rafts?
no.
probably want to work up to that one.
give it another shot.
can you tell us about the other clients Alexa dated?
now, that's a great question. Isn't that a great question?
Alexa didn't have any other clients.
Jerome was her first, and once he started with her, he never dated any of the other girls.
how did the other girls take that?
you'll have to ask them.
didn't bother me when he went with Alexa.
busier than ever, actually.
do you like Jerome?
he was a real gentleman.
he always said, "please," and "thank you."
showered, too, and, uh, soaped everywhere.
how did you spend your time together?
Oh, you know, we had fondue.
went whale-watching. - He'd read to me.
for $400 an hour?
I'm worth it. Would you like to read to me?
you seem a little nervous, hon. First time?
I... usually do this in uniform.
funny. Me too. Maybe you should give me a call.
uh, I'm married. Very, very married.
what about you, cutie? Are you very married, too?
Yeah, married, yep.
you are not married. - To the law-- married to the law.
well, call if she gives you the night off.
whale-watching, rollerblading, reading? You and Jerome did have sex?
well, yes, but not until the third date.
he said we had to wait.
he was very old-fashioned that way.
did he ever talk about his business?
I didn't really understand it. He sold things that aren't there.
it's complicated for a layman.
a lay what?
uh, did Jerome, uh, always pay on time?
on time and in cash.
tipped real well, too.
a lay what?
what did you talk about, then?
mostly he would talk about his birds.
his what? - His birds.
Jerome could talk about his pigeons for hours.
his pigeons.
Yeah, he was a little obsessed.
I think he might've spent more money on them than he did on me.
didn't you see them?
Yeah, I think I might have.
a lay what?
don't understand keeping an animal most people pay to exterminate.
Bobby, how come you never see a baby pigeon?
you worked downtown all those years. You ever see a baby pigeon?
you know, you're right.
where the hell are all the baby pigeons?
where do you think Alexa is?
she killed Jerome and took off.
or she saw who killed Jerome and took off. Or...
or she's dead, too. - Or she's dead, too.
but there was no picture of Rafts with Alexa, and Alexa had her head turned away from that camera in the elevator.
what's that mean?
Hey, you find that bird yet?
you have experience with a poly?
uh, given it, never taken it.
this test is for your security clearance.
the bureau needs to know your secrets, what you're hiding, so they can't be used against you by others.
if we know your secrets, you can't be blackmailed, can you?
if you wish not to take this test, I can have an agent drive you home.
I have nothing to hide.
then you would be the first. Okay, section one.
aren't you gonna turn the machine on?
it's been on. Section one--your father's name is Jack Reese?
Yes. - He was an lapd cop?
Yes.
is this why you became a cop? - No.
Yes. Yes.
to the best of your knowledge, did your father ever break the law?
to the best of my knowledge, no.
we'll come back to this.
as a cop, uh, you did undercover work?
Yes.
involving narcotics? - Yes.
you yourself used narcotics. - Yes.
you had a relationship with one of your suspects?
Yes.
we'll come back to this.
so which one of you is Ronnie Pollen, and which one of you is Mitch?
uh, I'm Ronnie. This is Mitch.
it'd help if you didn't dress alike. - Help what?
you want to explain why you were found in a dead man's coop?
we're fanciers.
pigeon fanciers. - Yeah.
you raise pigeons.
Yeah, man's been doing it for 10, 000 years.
like for food? You eating them?
no, we don't eat them. We show them. - No. Yeah.
and why were you in Rafts' coop?
Jerome Rafts gave us a bad egg.
a-a bad what?
a bad egg. We bought an egg supposedly out of Bloody Mary.
and that would be a bird.
Yeah, one of Rafts' prized birds. - We took that egg in good faith.
Yeah, but when it hatched, we could clearly see it was not Bloody Mary's offspring.
we were bamboozled.
did you confront Rafts with this?
Yes, but he said the egg was true. - But it was not true.
no.
so you went to get a true egg. - Yes.
and where were you last night?
in our own coop.
you live in a pigeon coop?
no, we have a coop behind our house. We were tending it last night.
you ever seen Rafts with this girl?
Alexa. His girlfriend--so pretty.
very pretty. - Yes, she is.
anything else you can tell us about her?
well, she knew a lot about pigeons. - Yeah.
she was a fancier, too?
Yeah, she knew her rollers, her trumpeters, dragoons, flying tipplers, croppers...
berlin short faced tumblers, too.
a pretty girl who knew her berlin short faced tumblers.
Yeah.
can I tell you the real reason why I want to take your class?
no, I-I want you to lie to me.
you--you-- you can't smoke in here.
you have got to promise me you won't think less of me when I tell you why I want to take your class.
okay, I-I promise.
because every teacher I've ever had my entire life was chock full of crap.
shall I tell you why?
uh, you-- you can't smoke in here.
because they knew nothing of the world.
I mean, they grew up in books, but you know the world, Mr. Earley.
I do.
and great heights and all the way down.
all the way down.
prison, twice.
that is not a book, Mr. Earley. That is the world.
that's why I want to take your class.
uh, you--you--you really can't smoke in here.
then let's go someplace where I can...
smoke.
tech support case number 78239847.
this is June. How may I help you?
it's India, isn't it? You're in India.
you know this call is monitored.
june, can I ask you a question?
do you think two people can be perfect for each other?
sir, I
I usually talk these things through with Reese, but, uh...
well, I could talk to Stark, but, you know.
I don't. I don't know this Reese. I don't know this Stark.
I do know you need to have a technical issue if you wish to continue this call.
okay, technically, don't you think it's amazing that I'm here in L. A.
and you're in, let's say, India, giving me tech support for my phone made in China?
but I am not giving you tech support.
so now I'm hanging up, sir.
it is India, isn't it?
and I bet your name isn't June.
we opened the business file on Rafts' computer. Guess what.
they're empty? That bubble burst.
I don't know how he made his money, but it wasn't derivatives.
no bank records either. Nothing.
so how was Rafts making his money to pay for those women?
and where was he keeping it?
if it was drugs, his prints aren't in the system.
where are you with the escort?
all we got is this sketch.
got to sit somewhere.
they were perfect for each other.
Jerome Rafts and Alexa.
you ever meet the perfect girl?
when you were sober?
so we don't know how Rafts earned his money, but we know Alexa knew her pigeons.
so what are the odds that a beautiful escort into pigeons gets hired by a rich John also into pigeons?
when you say it like that, I got to put it at a billion-to-none.
antifreeze, ammonia, bleach, broom handle, cut phone cords.
we thought it was rage-- an angry woman.
what else could it be? - What if it were reason?
she knew those birds, Bobby.
she took time to work out what Jerome Rafts liked.
you know a woman who would take that kind of time and then come in here and give herself over to rage to anger?
she took time.
what would she have done if he hadn't dropped that wine?
what would she have done if he hadn't dropped that wine?
what, fry him in the tub? No way.
I got an electrician cousin assured me these gfci outlets trip the circuit in 1/30 of a second.
can't kill a man that way no more.
looks like something's in there.
looks like nail polish.
ammonia, antifreeze, bleach, a broom handle...
nail polish.
Ooh, charlie, don't you
I guess she really was a pro.
a hit man?
uh, woman.
hit man woman. Hit woman.
a paid professional killer.
and you think this because there was nail polish in the outlet?
that and because of a dead gun company whistle blower in Fresno.
loose balcony rail-- ten-floor dive.
a dead D.E.A. Informant in Oakland.
found hung by the cord of the window blinds.
and a dead labor leader in Indio.
rat poison in his frijoles.
no knives, no guns -- uses only things everyone leaves around the house, never leaves any fingerprints, no dna.
a hit man.
hit man woman.
what makes you think it was her?
caught on camera leaving the labor leader's motel in Indio.
and what else do we know?
all we really know is what we don't know.
we don't know how Jerome Rafts earned all his money, so we don't know why she killed him, so we don't know who hired her to kill him.
we don't know who she is, where she is, or where she came from.
then again, neither do the police in Indio, Oakland, or Fresno.
one thing we do know they didn't know...
we know she knew her pigeons.
if I want to learn about pigeons, who would I get to teach me?
do you want to learn about pigeons?
answer the question, bird boy.
well, in the world of L. A."Pigeondom," there's about, uh, about a dozen master fanciers.
we're gonna need their names.
I have a sketch I'd like to show them.
she was polite, well-dressed, soft-spoken.
she asked many questions, and she listened to each answer.
she sat right on the edge of her chair.
Perched?
Yes.
very lightly.
did she reveal anything personal about herself-- where she lived, her friends?
no, she kept herself to herself, much like a pigeon, really.
like the berlin short-faced tumbler?
no, more like the archangel
narrow tail, moderately wide and slightly pronounced breast, long, thin neck, and the eyes--utterly vivid eyes.
she really liked these birds?
Yes, which is why I was surprised when the one I sold her came back.
came back?
last week, it was back in the pen.
you--you sure it was her pigeon?
it's not like they all look alike, you know?
why would a pigeon come back?
if it didn't feel cared for, which is why I was surprised.
I really thought her affections were...honest.
where would that bird go if you stopped caring for it?
but why would I stop caring for it?
well--well, I suppose it would do what any of us would.
return to a familiar place.
your partner spent time in prison.
has he talked about this time?
Yes.
and what did he say?
uh, he said he kne a transvestite named Angel who made a great carrot cake.
okay.
did he talk to you about why he was sent to prison?
no.
do you know who Mickey Rayborn is?
exactly what kind of security clearance is this?
no food or water, hmm?
you're a tough bird.
I would've broke by now.
everybody breaks, Bobby.
you got to know that going in.
the bird and I will both eat once the killer has been caught.
I've been a cop a long time.
seen women kill for a lot of reasons.
you ever see one kill because it's her job?
no, sir, that I have not.
well, let's go see what one looks like.
how'd that guy describe her breast?
slightly pronounced.
Yeah, I wish he hadn't said that.
pull over here.
that the pigeon in that tree there?
I guess so, but I got to tell you-- they all look alike to me.
well, according to this, it's that house.
is that her?
what's that in her hand, Charlie?
that, bobby, is a broom.
uh, no, sorry.
my name's Claudia.
is there an Alexa who lives here?
no, there's not.
just you, then?
and you are?
LAPD.
we're looking for an Alexa who has a real interest in raising pigeons.
well, sorry to disappoint, but my name's claudia, and I'm a personal chef.
so I-I could cook you a pigeon, but I-I can't raise one.
what has this pigeon-raiser done?
we just want to ask her a few questions.
we think she's a contract killer.
a contract...
a hit man...woman.
hit woman.
raises birds and kills people.
gets paid for it, too.
just the killing people part.
we'd just like to clear you as a suspect.
it's a procedural thing.
would you mind coming with us?
let me get my bag.
wow, big purse.
what's in it?
this and that, women's things.
I like to be prepared.
is that your car?
is it undercover?
it's not undercover, but it's unmarked.
this is exciting.
I've never been in a police car before.
you sure about that?
I think I'd remember.
does it have a siren?
can we use it?
none of you recognize her as Alexa?
there's a resemblance...
but I can't say it's her for sure.
take another look.
you must understand, I only met with Alexa once.
she had short, dark hair and makeup.
the rest of the time we spoke on the phone.
what about you?
Oh, I agree with, um, the lady.
I mean, she resembles Alexa, but I couldn't say for sure.
I mean, she seems so different.
Oh, come on.
what about the vivid eyes, the slightly pronounced breast?
no, the eyes are vivid, but the breast is less pronounced.
to tell true, I-I have a tough time telling humans apart.
what about you two?
well, she looks kind of the same, but...
she seems like a different girl.
different but the same. - Same but different.
same but different. - Different but the same.
this was fun.
I like to try everything once.
well, you can cross that off your list.
I can do just that, detective.
would you like a ride home?
no, I'll take the bus.
if you ever need any chefing, you know where I am.
I grabbed these before I left the house.
they're homemade.
you two looked hungry.
Oh, it looks tasty.
what's in it?
just stuff I had around the house.
probably shouldn't eat that.
probably not.
I hope you're not hungry.
there's some leftovers in the fridge, but I don't know what they are
meat, cheese, some of Charlie's evidence.
he's a-a cop, so he has evidence.
he doesn't bring it home, though, so I-I don't really think it's his, uh...
I thought you ducked out for a smoke.
I-I went looking for the loo, actually.
the loo?
Oh, the bathroom.
Yeah, I know.
tell me again why you wanTed to take my class.
you think you can tell who a person is just by looking in their eyes?
that's a strange question to ask a woman who spends her life talking to people she will never meet.
Yeah, I guess it is.
the buddha was born in India, you know.
Nepal...
what is now nepal.
may I ask-- what are you looking for?
right now?
a killer.
you're here alone?
I am.
how come you're here alone?
I'm looking for some chefing.
I can do any number from two to 200, and I can make the menu for you, or you can just tell me what you like.
no, thank you.
a little wine won't kill you.
I'm driving.
suit yourself.
maybe I could do a lamb.
is it an afternoon or an evening event?
you must look very different when you're working.
no, not really.
maybe a nicer apron, sometimes that silly, little hat.
I'd think with the intensity it takes to do your work that, uh, when you're on the job, it'd be hard to recognize you.
I suppose sometimes I can get intense.
when you're on the job.
Yes, but here in my kitchen, just me and my knives, it's calming.
do you cook, detective?
no.
I bet you'd be real good at it.
you're very good with a knife.
I've had some practice.
but not cooking.
no.
you work alone?
Yes.
I like to have a partner...
someone to watch your back.
are you sure you don't want some wine?
I could go for a diet soda if you got it.
diet soda?
Really?
you--you don't look like the diet soda type.
well, looks, you know, deceiving.
the coroner found no skin under Rafts' nails.
your chef didn't get that scratch from the victim.
how you doing without Reese?
maybe you should talk to someone.
maybe you should talk to someone.
Oh, I am-- a woman from tech support.
you're talking to a woman from lapd tech support?
no, for the bluetooth in my car.
still, it seems to be helping.
I can give you her number.
captain.
we got human skin under a few of the claws.
uh, male and female is all we can tell here in the field.
if we put her with one of those human female samples, we match her to the victim, but it's not enough to indict.
she does what she does 'cause no one knows she's doing it.
she knows that we know she's doing what she's doing, she's got to do something else, hasn't she?
you want a DNA warrant?
you still see her?
she's still here.
she's just been puttering around the house.
girl sure likes to putter.
tidwell got us a warrant for her DNA.
I'm on my way to serve it now.
Hey, Bobby.
wait for me to get there.
sure, Charlie.
how'd you find me?
Pigeon-- you threw it away.
I should've killed that bird.
it's gonna be okay.
no, detective, it's not gonna be okay.
I'm not a detective.
I'm just-- Here, I made this myself.
No! Spit it out.
spit it out!
I'm gonna miss living at the beach.
really liked all the light.
how does it feel?
I made it from mushrooms I grew under my sink.
paralysis first-- muscular, then neural, then the organs-- the lungs, the heart, the brain.
but you'll be dead before that.
you know, most people underestimate the value of things found in their own home.
not me, though.
picked this up on my last job.
think I'm gonna work it into the act.
what do you think?
you know, that man just wouldn't die.
okay...
I'll be going now.
officer needs help.
hold on there, Bobby.
just one person traveling.
Yes.
first class.
Yeah, uh, I-I'll pay the penalty.
Yes, cash.
Oh, you're--you're gonna have to hold on a minute.
you know it's against the law to talk on the phone like that?
if you want to go hands-free, I got someone you can talk to.
you did this to my car.
diet soda in the gas tank.
just something you had lying around the house.
probably kill me with these.
I never met a woman who killed because it was her job.
guess you can cross that off your list, detective.
I guess I can.
why'd you kill Jerome Rafts?
I'm just a chef, detective.
you have me confused with someone else.
a hit man woman?
Yep, a hit man woman.
and Stark's gonna be okay?
we jacked him full of epinephrine.
he won't be eating any mushrooms.
and you still don't know why she killed Jerome Rafts?
you're doing it, aren't you?
you're staring at something.
and now you're taking out some fruit, right?
what do you see, Crews?
that's a lot of birdseed.
Hey, pigeons don't eat that much, do they?
I mean, they eat like a bird, right?
that's a lot of birdseed.
he was the competition.
he was a hit man.
traced that rifle to six assassinations.
but, you know, we're in a down cycle, so there just wasn't enough business for the both of them.
sir, are you telling me these things hands-free?
Yes, I am.
then I shall close this case file.
your name isn't June, is it?
no, it is Deepa.
it was a pleasure talking to you, Deepa.
it was a pleasure talking to you, detective Crews.
did you try turning it on and off?
the phone or the car?
the phone, sir. - Yes.
is it a new phone? - No.
it is a new car? - No. Yes. No.
no, I mean, it used to be my car, then I-I gave it to this girl.
and then I got another car, but then I wanTed this car back because the other one was full of bullet holes, and people kept telling me I shouldn't be driving a car full of bullet holes.
so I bought this one back, but she painTed flowers on it.
I had the flowers taken off. Now the phone won't sync up.
have you made sure that you have correctly entered your personal pin number?
can I ask you a question? Where exactly are you?
I'm sorry, sir. We are not allowed to talk about our personal lives.
you're very far away, aren't you?
because I'm looking at los angeles, and I have the feeling that you are the other side of the world, looking at things that I could only imagine.
could that be true?
I am looking at my computer, sir.
please describe your service problem to me exactly.
my phone is supposed to sync up with my car, so I can talk hands-free.
it's against the law for me to hold my phone while I'm driving, and I would hate to break the law, because I'm
I'm kind of a cop.
kind of?
I would think that either you are a cop or you're not a cop.
I'm a cop.
neighbors heard the same cd playing for ten hours straight.
they called the landlord.
the landlord comes in, and he sees this.
Where's the landlord now?
under heavy sedation.
did he say anything?
he said, "man on a stick."
looks like poison, too.
I'm guessing antifreeze.
taste of the wine might've covered it up.
Yeah.
he drinks the wine...
someone watches him stumble across the room.
and then someone pins him to the wall.
man on a stick.
bleach and ammonia...
make chlorine.
antifreeze in the wine and a broken broom handle.
Yeah, things found around the house.
Jerome Rafts-- financial advisor.
risk acquisitions-- derivatives.
maybe Jerome mishandled someone's money.
I don't think we're getting anything off that computer.
you get ripped off, you bring a gun or a pipe.
Oh, yeah, a pipe is good.
then you can feel it, you know, when the bone breaks.
too much information?
Hey, Reese, look at this.
Oh, Jerome liked to date.
there's a different woman in each of these photos.
well, maybe one of the women didn't like sharing Jerome.
for that, I could see using antifreeze, bleach...
ammonia and a broom handle.
Jerome sure looks happy, though.
I'm' looking at Jerome. He doesn't look too happy.
man on a stick.
Reese, something else-- there was a..
there was what?
a bird. A pigeon.
it flew against the window, tried to get in.
that means something, right?
a bird in the house after a death?
I hate birds. - I hate birds.
you, keep doing what you're doing. Come with me.
FBI called this morning.
they want to borrow a few lapd detectives for a joint organized-crime task force.
I think you should do it.
you'd be on loan, still lapd, for a few weeks here in L. A.
looks great on the resume when you want to move up the ladder, which you do.
when do I have to tell them?
they need you there today. - Well, what about the case?
the vic has a shelf full of girlfriends and a broom handle through and through.
it's done. He'll be fine.
you should do this.
it's a new situation for you.
I want you think of it like you're building a building.
you got to put in a good foundation, or everything you do after that is just gonna come tumbling down.
I'll see you in a few weeks, Crews.
okay, but remember what I said-- good foundation right away.
everything else after that is just a waste.
and you got that speech in...
kindergarten. But it's a good speech.
it's--it's the foundation speech.
Oh, they grow up so fast, don't they?
found this in the closet.
wireless computer backup.
everything on Jerome Rafts' computers will be on here.
Reese usually starts.
maybe you could
why don't I just jump in?
Jerome Rafts, 38 years old, moved from North Dakota nine years ago, works at home.
he's a financial advisor specializing in derivative do you know what a derivative is?
a derivative is when you don't invest in a thing, but you kind of invest in a thing like the thing you're investing in.
Yeah, me neither.
tech guys couldn't bust open security on his business files, so we don't know his clients yet.
who are the girlfriends?
they're not exactly girlfriends.
tech did find a file on each of them in Jerome Rafts' computer
hours spent with each girl at a cost of $400 per hour.
eight hours with Veronica-- $3, 200.
four hours with Harper-- $1, 600.
13 hours with Trish-- $4, 800.
$4, 800 only gets you 12 hours.
I guess the 13th hour's free, like doughnuts.
but the winner is Alexa-- $9, 600 over the last month.
what kind of guy displays photos of himself with escorts like they were his girlfriends?
he's a financial advisor.
you know, his world is money.
you know, just because he paid for his relationships, didn't make them any less real.
don't you think this is weird?
you know, just us two without Reese?
let's just keep the ball moving. Did Rafts have date last night?
Yeah, with Alexa.
anything on the security cameras?
we got this.
doesn't live in the building, wasn't a guest of anyone in the building.
but she's looking down and away from the camera. Could be anyone.
what did you do to that woman, pal, that she'd do that to you?
phone numbers on any of the girls?
we dumped Rafts' phone, didn't find any calls to the women.
we did find one call he made repeaTedly to a woman named Brenda Trill.
every time Rafts called Trill, Rafts had a date.
Brenda Trill's the madam. - I'm on my way to check her out now.
I guess you'll need someone to fill in for Reese while she's gone.
captain, we--we both might need someone to fill in for Reese, and, um,
I want you to know you can, uh, you can always talk to me.
anything you-- you want to talk about?
I'll go talk to the madam, then.
I-I know this doesn't make me detective.
I'm still just a patrolman in a cheap suit.
I'm happy to have you in the car.
Charlie, I wasn't exactly there for you the last time we partnered, so...
Hey, you want me out of this car, I am out.
Bobby, I requesTed you.
I prayed for this. I'm not ashamed to say, prayed...
for you and me to be in a car again.
I'm guessing you prayed for other things.
Yeah, I did-- other things.
that dead guy sure did like the pros, though, huh? All that money.
Yeah, don't think Jerome Rafts had much else in his life.
seems like the relationships he paid for were the only ones he had.
that's so wrong. You don't pay a pro to stay. You pay her to leave.
Charlie Sheen said that.
Jerome Rafts-- financial advisor.
risk acquisitions-- derivatives.
do you know what a derivative is?
sure, it's the kind of investment where you're really not, um...
well, it's--it's--it's-- it's when you're, uh... no. No, no idea.
Yes, I-I know what a derivative is.
it's--it's-- it's kind of hard to explain to a layperson.
to a layperson, Ted? Are you saying I wouldn't understand it?
no, I'm saying it's complicated.
okay, a derivative is a financial product whose value is derived from the value of something else, the underlying.
now, because the value of the derivative is contingent on the value of the underlying, the notional value of derivatives is recorded off the balance sheet, while the market value of derivatives is recorded on the balance sheet.
I don't understand it.
don't feel bad. No one does.
uh, why do you need to know?
I got a dead financial advisor, specialized in derivatives.
how broke was he?
don't think he was broke. Why?
well, the derivative bubble burst.
if the guy had money, it was from somewhere else.
it came from somewhere else?
are you Ted Earley? - Yes.
and you are? - Amanda.
how can I help you, Amanda?
well, actually, I'm interested in taking your class, you know, going back to school and all that.
would it be all right if I asked you some questions?
what's that going through him?
a broom handle.
he was with a girl named Alexa last night.
that's right--Alexa.
can we talk to her? - You can try.
when she didn't check in after her date, I called her cell.
it was no longer in service.
do you have her address, then?
I don't know where any of my girls live, for their own safety.
are any of these Alexa?
no.
do you have a photo of her?
you mean like on her company I. D?
I guess not.
we're gonna want you to talk to a sketch artist.
Bobby... do you have a question you'd like to ask of Miss Trill?
Yeah. Uh, sure, okay, uh...
uh, let me see, uh...
do you know who killed Jerome Rafts?
no.
probably want to work up to that one.
give it another shot.
can you tell us about the other clients Alexa dated?
now, that's a great question. Isn't that a great question?
Alexa didn't have any other clients.
Jerome was her first, and once he started with her, he never dated any of the other girls.
how did the other girls take that?
you'll have to ask them.
didn't bother me when he went with Alexa.
busier than ever, actually.
do you like Jerome?
he was a real gentleman.
he always said, "please," and "thank you."
showered, too, and, uh, soaped everywhere.
how did you spend your time together?
Oh, you know, we had fondue.
went whale-watching. - He'd read to me.
for $400 an hour?
I'm worth it. Would you like to read to me?
you seem a little nervous, hon. First time?
I... usually do this in uniform.
funny. Me too. Maybe you should give me a call.
uh, I'm married. Very, very married.
what about you, cutie? Are you very married, too?
Yeah, married, yep.
you are not married. - To the law-- married to the law.
well, call if she gives you the night off.
whale-watching, rollerblading, reading? You and Jerome did have sex?
well, yes, but not until the third date.
he said we had to wait.
he was very old-fashioned that way.
did he ever talk about his business?
I didn't really understand it. He sold things that aren't there.
it's complicated for a layman.
a lay what?
uh, did Jerome, uh, always pay on time?
on time and in cash.
tipped real well, too.
a lay what?
what did you talk about, then?
mostly he would talk about his birds.
his what? - His birds.
Jerome could talk about his pigeons for hours.
his pigeons.
Yeah, he was a little obsessed.
I think he might've spent more money on them than he did on me.
didn't you see them?
Yeah, I think I might have.
a lay what?
don't understand keeping an animal most people pay to exterminate.
Bobby, how come you never see a baby pigeon?
you worked downtown all those years. You ever see a baby pigeon?
you know, you're right.
where the hell are all the baby pigeons?
where do you think Alexa is?
she killed Jerome and took off.
or she saw who killed Jerome and took off. Or...
or she's dead, too. - Or she's dead, too.
but there was no picture of Rafts with Alexa, and Alexa had her head turned away from that camera in the elevator.
what's that mean?
Hey, you find that bird yet?
you have experience with a poly?
uh, given it, never taken it.
this test is for your security clearance.
the bureau needs to know your secrets, what you're hiding, so they can't be used against you by others.
if we know your secrets, you can't be blackmailed, can you?
if you wish not to take this test, I can have an agent drive you home.
I have nothing to hide.
then you would be the first. Okay, section one.
aren't you gonna turn the machine on?
it's been on. Section one--your father's name is Jack Reese?
Yes. - He was an lapd cop?
Yes.
is this why you became a cop? - No.
Yes. Yes.
to the best of your knowledge, did your father ever break the law?
to the best of my knowledge, no.
we'll come back to this.
as a cop, uh, you did undercover work?
Yes.
involving narcotics? - Yes.
you yourself used narcotics. - Yes.
you had a relationship with one of your suspects?
Yes.
we'll come back to this.
so which one of you is Ronnie Pollen, and which one of you is Mitch?
uh, I'm Ronnie. This is Mitch.
it'd help if you didn't dress alike. - Help what?
you want to explain why you were found in a dead man's coop?
we're fanciers.
pigeon fanciers. - Yeah.
you raise pigeons.
Yeah, man's been doing it for 10, 000 years.
like for food? You eating them?
no, we don't eat them. We show them. - No. Yeah.
and why were you in Rafts' coop?
Jerome Rafts gave us a bad egg.
a-a bad what?
a bad egg. We bought an egg supposedly out of Bloody Mary.
and that would be a bird.
Yeah, one of Rafts' prized birds. - We took that egg in good faith.
Yeah, but when it hatched, we could clearly see it was not Bloody Mary's offspring.
we were bamboozled.
did you confront Rafts with this?
Yes, but he said the egg was true. - But it was not true.
no.
so you went to get a true egg. - Yes.
and where were you last night?
in our own coop.
you live in a pigeon coop?
no, we have a coop behind our house. We were tending it last night.
you ever seen Rafts with this girl?
Alexa. His girlfriend--so pretty.
very pretty. - Yes, she is.
anything else you can tell us about her?
well, she knew a lot about pigeons. - Yeah.
she was a fancier, too?
Yeah, she knew her rollers, her trumpeters, dragoons, flying tipplers, croppers...
berlin short faced tumblers, too.
a pretty girl who knew her berlin short faced tumblers.
Yeah.
can I tell you the real reason why I want to take your class?
no, I-I want you to lie to me.
you--you-- you can't smoke in here.
you have got to promise me you won't think less of me when I tell you why I want to take your class.
okay, I-I promise.
because every teacher I've ever had my entire life was chock full of crap.
shall I tell you why?
uh, you-- you can't smoke in here.
because they knew nothing of the world.
I mean, they grew up in books, but you know the world, Mr. Earley.
I do.
and great heights and all the way down.
all the way down.
prison, twice.
that is not a book, Mr. Earley. That is the world.
that's why I want to take your class.
uh, you--you--you really can't smoke in here.
then let's go someplace where I can...
smoke.
tech support case number 78239847.
this is June. How may I help you?
it's India, isn't it? You're in India.
you know this call is monitored.
june, can I ask you a question?
do you think two people can be perfect for each other?
sir, I
I usually talk these things through with Reese, but, uh...
well, I could talk to Stark, but, you know.
I don't. I don't know this Reese. I don't know this Stark.
I do know you need to have a technical issue if you wish to continue this call.
okay, technically, don't you think it's amazing that I'm here in L. A.
and you're in, let's say, India, giving me tech support for my phone made in China?
but I am not giving you tech support.
so now I'm hanging up, sir.
it is India, isn't it?
and I bet your name isn't June.
we opened the business file on Rafts' computer. Guess what.
they're empty? That bubble burst.
I don't know how he made his money, but it wasn't derivatives.
no bank records either. Nothing.
so how was Rafts making his money to pay for those women?
and where was he keeping it?
if it was drugs, his prints aren't in the system.
where are you with the escort?
all we got is this sketch.
got to sit somewhere.
they were perfect for each other.
Jerome Rafts and Alexa.
you ever meet the perfect girl?
when you were sober?
so we don't know how Rafts earned his money, but we know Alexa knew her pigeons.
so what are the odds that a beautiful escort into pigeons gets hired by a rich John also into pigeons?
when you say it like that, I got to put it at a billion-to-none.
antifreeze, ammonia, bleach, broom handle, cut phone cords.
we thought it was rage-- an angry woman.
what else could it be? - What if it were reason?
she knew those birds, Bobby.
she took time to work out what Jerome Rafts liked.
you know a woman who would take that kind of time and then come in here and give herself over to rage to anger?
she took time.
what would she have done if he hadn't dropped that wine?
what would she have done if he hadn't dropped that wine?
what, fry him in the tub? No way.
I got an electrician cousin assured me these gfci outlets trip the circuit in 1/30 of a second.
can't kill a man that way no more.
looks like something's in there.
looks like nail polish.
ammonia, antifreeze, bleach, a broom handle...
nail polish.
Ooh, charlie, don't you
I guess she really was a pro.
a hit man?
uh, woman.
hit man woman. Hit woman.
a paid professional killer.
and you think this because there was nail polish in the outlet?
that and because of a dead gun company whistle blower in Fresno.
loose balcony rail-- ten-floor dive.
a dead D.E.A. Informant in Oakland.
found hung by the cord of the window blinds.
and a dead labor leader in Indio.
rat poison in his frijoles.
no knives, no guns -- uses only things everyone leaves around the house, never leaves any fingerprints, no dna.
a hit man.
hit man woman.
what makes you think it was her?
caught on camera leaving the labor leader's motel in Indio.
and what else do we know?
all we really know is what we don't know.
we don't know how Jerome Rafts earned all his money, so we don't know why she killed him, so we don't know who hired her to kill him.
we don't know who she is, where she is, or where she came from.
then again, neither do the police in Indio, Oakland, or Fresno.
one thing we do know they didn't know...
we know she knew her pigeons.
if I want to learn about pigeons, who would I get to teach me?
do you want to learn about pigeons?
answer the question, bird boy.
well, in the world of L. A."Pigeondom," there's about, uh, about a dozen master fanciers.
we're gonna need their names.
I have a sketch I'd like to show them.
she was polite, well-dressed, soft-spoken.
she asked many questions, and she listened to each answer.
she sat right on the edge of her chair.
Perched?
Yes.
very lightly.
did she reveal anything personal about herself-- where she lived, her friends?
no, she kept herself to herself, much like a pigeon, really.
like the berlin short-faced tumbler?
no, more like the archangel
narrow tail, moderately wide and slightly pronounced breast, long, thin neck, and the eyes--utterly vivid eyes.
she really liked these birds?
Yes, which is why I was surprised when the one I sold her came back.
came back?
last week, it was back in the pen.
you--you sure it was her pigeon?
it's not like they all look alike, you know?
why would a pigeon come back?
if it didn't feel cared for, which is why I was surprised.
I really thought her affections were...honest.
where would that bird go if you stopped caring for it?
but why would I stop caring for it?
well--well, I suppose it would do what any of us would.
return to a familiar place.
your partner spent time in prison.
has he talked about this time?
Yes.
and what did he say?
uh, he said he kne a transvestite named Angel who made a great carrot cake.
okay.
did he talk to you about why he was sent to prison?
no.
do you know who Mickey Rayborn is?
exactly what kind of security clearance is this?
no food or water, hmm?
you're a tough bird.
I would've broke by now.
everybody breaks, Bobby.
you got to know that going in.
the bird and I will both eat once the killer has been caught.
I've been a cop a long time.
seen women kill for a lot of reasons.
you ever see one kill because it's her job?
no, sir, that I have not.
well, let's go see what one looks like.
how'd that guy describe her breast?
slightly pronounced.
Yeah, I wish he hadn't said that.
pull over here.
that the pigeon in that tree there?
I guess so, but I got to tell you-- they all look alike to me.
well, according to this, it's that house.
is that her?
what's that in her hand, Charlie?
that, bobby, is a broom.
uh, no, sorry.
my name's Claudia.
is there an Alexa who lives here?
no, there's not.
just you, then?
and you are?
LAPD.
we're looking for an Alexa who has a real interest in raising pigeons.
well, sorry to disappoint, but my name's claudia, and I'm a personal chef.
so I-I could cook you a pigeon, but I-I can't raise one.
what has this pigeon-raiser done?
we just want to ask her a few questions.
we think she's a contract killer.
a contract...
a hit man...woman.
hit woman.
raises birds and kills people.
gets paid for it, too.
just the killing people part.
we'd just like to clear you as a suspect.
it's a procedural thing.
would you mind coming with us?
let me get my bag.
wow, big purse.
what's in it?
this and that, women's things.
I like to be prepared.
is that your car?
is it undercover?
it's not undercover, but it's unmarked.
this is exciting.
I've never been in a police car before.
you sure about that?
I think I'd remember.
does it have a siren?
can we use it?
none of you recognize her as Alexa?
there's a resemblance...
but I can't say it's her for sure.
take another look.
you must understand, I only met with Alexa once.
she had short, dark hair and makeup.
the rest of the time we spoke on the phone.
what about you?
Oh, I agree with, um, the lady.
I mean, she resembles Alexa, but I couldn't say for sure.
I mean, she seems so different.
Oh, come on.
what about the vivid eyes, the slightly pronounced breast?
no, the eyes are vivid, but the breast is less pronounced.
to tell true, I-I have a tough time telling humans apart.
what about you two?
well, she looks kind of the same, but...
she seems like a different girl.
different but the same. - Same but different.
same but different. - Different but the same.
this was fun.
I like to try everything once.
well, you can cross that off your list.
I can do just that, detective.
would you like a ride home?
no, I'll take the bus.
if you ever need any chefing, you know where I am.
I grabbed these before I left the house.
they're homemade.
you two looked hungry.
Oh, it looks tasty.
what's in it?
just stuff I had around the house.
probably shouldn't eat that.
probably not.
I hope you're not hungry.
there's some leftovers in the fridge, but I don't know what they are
meat, cheese, some of Charlie's evidence.
he's a-a cop, so he has evidence.
he doesn't bring it home, though, so I-I don't really think it's his, uh...
I thought you ducked out for a smoke.
I-I went looking for the loo, actually.
the loo?
Oh, the bathroom.
Yeah, I know.
tell me again why you wanTed to take my class.
you think you can tell who a person is just by looking in their eyes?
that's a strange question to ask a woman who spends her life talking to people she will never meet.
Yeah, I guess it is.
the buddha was born in India, you know.
Nepal...
what is now nepal.
may I ask-- what are you looking for?
right now?
a killer.
you're here alone?
I am.
how come you're here alone?
I'm looking for some chefing.
I can do any number from two to 200, and I can make the menu for you, or you can just tell me what you like.
no, thank you.
a little wine won't kill you.
I'm driving.
suit yourself.
maybe I could do a lamb.
is it an afternoon or an evening event?
you must look very different when you're working.
no, not really.
maybe a nicer apron, sometimes that silly, little hat.
I'd think with the intensity it takes to do your work that, uh, when you're on the job, it'd be hard to recognize you.
I suppose sometimes I can get intense.
when you're on the job.
Yes, but here in my kitchen, just me and my knives, it's calming.
do you cook, detective?
no.
I bet you'd be real good at it.
you're very good with a knife.
I've had some practice.
but not cooking.
no.
you work alone?
Yes.
I like to have a partner...
someone to watch your back.
are you sure you don't want some wine?
I could go for a diet soda if you got it.
diet soda?
Really?
you--you don't look like the diet soda type.
well, looks, you know, deceiving.
the coroner found no skin under Rafts' nails.
your chef didn't get that scratch from the victim.
how you doing without Reese?
maybe you should talk to someone.
maybe you should talk to someone.
Oh, I am-- a woman from tech support.
you're talking to a woman from lapd tech support?
no, for the bluetooth in my car.
still, it seems to be helping.
I can give you her number.
captain.
we got human skin under a few of the claws.
uh, male and female is all we can tell here in the field.
if we put her with one of those human female samples, we match her to the victim, but it's not enough to indict.
she does what she does 'cause no one knows she's doing it.
she knows that we know she's doing what she's doing, she's got to do something else, hasn't she?
you want a DNA warrant?
you still see her?
she's still here.
she's just been puttering around the house.
girl sure likes to putter.
tidwell got us a warrant for her DNA.
I'm on my way to serve it now.
Hey, Bobby.
wait for me to get there.
sure, Charlie.
how'd you find me?
Pigeon-- you threw it away.
I should've killed that bird.
it's gonna be okay.
no, detective, it's not gonna be okay.
I'm not a detective.
I'm just-- Here, I made this myself.
No! Spit it out.
spit it out!
I'm gonna miss living at the beach.
really liked all the light.
how does it feel?
I made it from mushrooms I grew under my sink.
paralysis first-- muscular, then neural, then the organs-- the lungs, the heart, the brain.
but you'll be dead before that.
you know, most people underestimate the value of things found in their own home.
not me, though.
picked this up on my last job.
think I'm gonna work it into the act.
what do you think?
you know, that man just wouldn't die.
okay...
I'll be going now.
officer needs help.
hold on there, Bobby.
just one person traveling.
Yes.
first class.
Yeah, uh, I-I'll pay the penalty.
Yes, cash.
Oh, you're--you're gonna have to hold on a minute.
you know it's against the law to talk on the phone like that?
if you want to go hands-free, I got someone you can talk to.
you did this to my car.
diet soda in the gas tank.
just something you had lying around the house.
probably kill me with these.
I never met a woman who killed because it was her job.
guess you can cross that off your list, detective.
I guess I can.
why'd you kill Jerome Rafts?
I'm just a chef, detective.
you have me confused with someone else.
a hit man woman?
Yep, a hit man woman.
and Stark's gonna be okay?
we jacked him full of epinephrine.
he won't be eating any mushrooms.
and you still don't know why she killed Jerome Rafts?
you're doing it, aren't you?
you're staring at something.
and now you're taking out some fruit, right?
what do you see, Crews?
that's a lot of birdseed.
Hey, pigeons don't eat that much, do they?
I mean, they eat like a bird, right?
that's a lot of birdseed.
he was the competition.
he was a hit man.
traced that rifle to six assassinations.
but, you know, we're in a down cycle, so there just wasn't enough business for the both of them.
sir, are you telling me these things hands-free?
Yes, I am.
then I shall close this case file.
your name isn't June, is it?
no, it is Deepa.
it was a pleasure talking to you, Deepa.
it was a pleasure talking to you, detective Crews.
crews. Come in here.
you need something?
Yeah, I do. Close the door.
get the blinds. - The
the blinds, yeah. Close all the blinds.
I need you to stomp on my foot.
you need me to stomp on your foot? - Yeah.
it's asleep. My foot's asleep.
asleep, huh? Hate it when that happens. It'll be awake all night now.
are you gonna stomp on my foot or not?
come on. Give it more than that.
anything? - Nothing. Take it up a notch.
my second wife, she was really good at this.
must have been something about her shoes.
what about Reese?
I'm bringing her along.
got a tingle. Do it again.
now I'm feeling it. One more time.
Ah, yeah! There it is. Yeah.
there's a dead guy at the beach.
dead guy.
what was -- Don't ask.
do all detectives have to do that?
Bobby, let's go to the beach.
anybody see anything?
runner.
he was coming through the crowd, then he just dropped.
big blade, hmm. Buck knife?
looks serrated. He just dropped?
stabbed through the heart. Turned him off like a light.
robbery gone wrong? Shove a victim, slit his pockets, knife slips.
well, he's got no pockets to slit.
no pockets. So no I. D.
you go out for a run, you lock the door, right?
don't run much. - That much.
no pockets.
you lock the door, where do you put the key?
the sea sprite. Ocean front motel.
out-of-towners love this zoo.
what's not to love?
clearly you are not a parent.
out-of-towners on vacation.
not on vacation. On leave.
army.
if our dead guy is one of 'em, that leaves three more.
one of 'em's a real little guy.
or not a guy at all.
what?
can I help you with something?
those are nice sunglasses. You get those on the beach.
you get a lot of sunglasses on the beach. It's sunny there.
I'm gonna ask you again. Can I help you with something?
well, you can start by telling your two friends behind us to put their hands in the air and get down on their knees.
all active duty U. S. Army.
back from Iraq. In L.A. on leave.
and the victim?
they all surf together and they all came here together.
I only count three beds.
all four staying in this room?
said they could only afford the one room, so they rotated, taking turns on the floor.
what about that diversion attack they pulled on you two?
said they saw strangers in their room.
training just kicked in.
I don't mean to sound unpatriotic, but I see a cute girl sharing a room with three boys and now one of the boys is dead.
well, they all alibi each other.
said they were all hanging at the pool while Slocum went for his run.
what? What?
it's just-- Reese told me to
Reese told you to what, captain?
Reese told me to make sure I always ask you what you see.
Ah, she said that, did she?
so? What do you see?
actually, it's what I don't see.
she said he might say that.
you're not wearing dog tags?
you're all still on active duty, right?
how come you took off your tags?
when a policeman takes off his badge, in my experience, it usually means he's up to no good.
I see those tags.
took 'em off because we're not over there just now.
because we just wanted to be here for two weeks.
operation: Fun and sun.
wouldn't expect you to understand.
okay. Listen.
my captain out there-- he sees a pretty girl and you fellas in this room, he's thinking jealousy.
not robbery.
Travis and us? We surf together. Kick major ass together.
wouldn't expect you to understand.
you don't expect a lot, do you?
I get what I get, and I don't get upset, sir.
Travis Slocum. We're gonna have to take this with us.
I'll make sure these get where they need to go.
it's okay, Andy.
detective Crews will be respectful with that.
won't you, sir?
they're all from the midwest.
they all saw heavy action in Iraq.
this, however, is their first time in L. A.
dirty clothes. Dirty clothes, dirty clothes.
a souvenir glass with the letters "A. F.O." Stenciled on it.
does not mean "air force one." We should find out where this came from.
where there's drinking, there's arguments.
arguments, there's violence.
got a lightweight protective vest in good condition. Very light.
and... - And what?
a medal for exceptional valor.
sadr city, Iraq, April 12, 2008. Victim was a hero.
and Tidwell thinks it's about the girl?
in the United States of New York City, where there's a dead guy, there's a girl there somewhere.
well, what do you think?
well, I think you put a knife into Slocum's heart like that, you need training to get that close without being seen, or he needs to know you, so
so you can get that close without causing any alarm.
and Travis' buddies -- Knew him and had the training.
Hey, Reese.
Reese, you said something nice about me to Tidwell, huh?
no, I didn't.
you know, Reese. With distance, you're appreciating me more.
well, that's just rude.
you know she's not here, right?
you get the video? - Yeah. It should be up now.
you can't see Reese here in this room, can you? I mean, is she -- is she here now?
so many people. Can't tell who got close to him and who didn't.
nobody saw him get stabbed.
nobody even noticed him till he fell.
nobody saw anything. I showed these pictures to everybody.
I even talked to the human statue.
Oh, yeah? What'd he say?
it was a girl.
said she didn't really look at the faces staring at her.
what's she looking at?
watching films in her head.
godfather iii today.
isn't that the worst one? - Yeah.
since she watched the other two, she likes to finish things, and
Slocum runs into this crowd alive, and he comes out dead.
how do you kill a guy like that?
okay. I'm Slocum. I'm jogging this way.
What--I just come up, stick you in the chest?
battle-tested soldier?
doesn't seem right.
you don't see Reese again, do you? Is she here now, Charlie?
how do you kill a guy like that?
he's been stabbed by-- here, maybe, two, three seconds.
wind it back.
you can't see him now. - We're not looking for him.
he gets stabbed right about... now.
there. Look at that. See the musician here?
she's turning up her amp.
this vendor spills his ice.
and these two guys here at the table, they start pushing each other.
all at the same time.
he said it was performance art.
he asked you to argue?
when we got a text, we started.
same with you?
Yeah, he did. He said it was performance art. He gave me $100.
paid you, too? What'd he look like?
white guy, sunglasses, hoodie.
could be. But, uh, like he said, he had a hoodie and sunglasses.
you remember anything else?
Yeah, he was a tough sale.
you tried to sell him something?
big bad Bertha. Since he had all that money.
but I couldn't get him to buy it.
you get him to touch it? - I did.
always put the merchandise in their hands.
first rule of sales.
you want to get that dusted for prints? - I do.
a diversion.
get Slocum's attention going one way, then push that knife right in his heart and no one sees it.
or the killer.
we've seen a diversion before, haven't we?
let's try this again. Do you know this man?
Yes.
you know his name?
Mickey Rayborn. - How do you know Mickey Rayborn?
I've seen him in the papers.
the stories about his murder? - Yes.
do you know him in any other way besides the stories in the paper?
Yes.
in what other way do you know Mickey Rayborn?
he was some kind of famous cop before I got on the force.
do you know Mickey Rayborn in any other way besides for him being some kind of famous cop?
Yes.
in what way would that be?
detective, your answers will not be used against you.
the bureau needs to know your secrets so no one will use them against me.
that's right. - Yeah.
in what other way do you know Mickey Rayborn, then?
he and my father were friends.
they were both cops?
Yes.
and where is your father now?
I don't know. He took off.
there is a detail left out of the newspaper articles about Rayborn's death.
do you know what it is?
no.
his body was never found.
as a detective, what's that mean to you?
all that blood in the water nearby, um...
I'm guessing he was butchered.
butchered.
do you know this man?
damn it, I can't do it.
watch movies in your head?
takes practice.
I used to be really good at it.
when you were inside?
godfather iii? - No.
home movies.
I'm guessing that must have hurt.
I'm guessing that's why I watched 'em.
take a look at that.
where is she going dressed like that?
why'd they take their dog tags off?
that's, like, a giant private jet.
come on. Let's follow her.
don't have a warrant or a ticket.
come on, the door's open. We can just walk on.
that plane, you don't need a ticket if you look like you have a ticket.
no, Charlie, you don't need a ticket because you look like you have a ticket.
me? I need a ticket.
okay.
keep your phone on. I'll call you when I land.
Jerry, that number's a joke.
Jerry, that number's so small I can't even see it.
wait, wait, do I see it? No. It's too small. False alarm. Bye, Jerry.
Jerry.
cell phone. Cell phone, sir.
thank you.
welcome to air fun one.
A. F.O.
is there anything else you'd like?
well, if it's a specific question, I don't need anything, but if it's a more general question
excuse me.
sometimes I think I don't need anything, but I do. I just don't know it.
well, is this what I need?
I need you off this plane.
you're not supposed to be here.
you're not supposed to be here, either.
why'd you take your dog tags off, Erin?
you know why. I'm working security.
which is against army regs. - I need the money.
I've been making less than minimum wage for two years.
a lot less. We all have.
everyone? You've got to be seated.
uh, one moment please. I'm just having some trouble with my... fastener.
okay. Listen. Travis was working this plane. You're working this plane.
anything you think I should know about what happens on this plane?
the service called me this morning. They thought travis flaked.
I didn't say what happened to him. It's none of their business.
I need the money. That's why we came.
but now Travis is dead.
Yeah. Travis is dead.
but I still need the money.
Erin, where's this plane going?
it doesn't really go anywhere.
so it's just a flying party where people get contracts signed?
why'd they take our phones?
because they all have cameras in 'em now.
you can sit there for takeoff.
the Way You Want
what if I don't know the way I want what I want?
you don't know what you want.
maybe I can help you figure it out.
Gus Wilvern. Chemxtech.
vice president, customer relations. And you are?
really, really enjoying this plane.
well, you'd have a disorder if you weren't.
and your name is? - Charlie Crews.
that Charlie Crews?
no, this Charlie Crews.
eh, falsely-accused Charlie Crews.
no, detective Charlie Crews.
you look a lot different in person.
I am a lot different in person.
a lot different in person. That's excellent.
I gotta ask you, though, who'd you come on board with?
Oh, just me.
and this murder investigation I got going on.
Slocum worked security for you.
temp. Didn't show up this morning. Our Slocum. Murdered.
here, after everything he'd been through.
maybe you wanna go easy.
just one more bottle. They're very tiny. We have the big ones.
people seem to prefer the little ones.
just nostalgia, I guess.
why did Travis work here?
Oh, these kids-- they get paid nothing on active duty.
I try and help 'em out when they're on leave. Between me and them.
so you pay 'em under the table?
they're not supposed to moonlight.
it's better for 'em. - And you.
anything that happens up here they can't talk about, can they?
what would happen up here?
Gus, you've got grown men up here walking around dressed up as cowboys and gladiators.
some guys like to fly around and play poker.
some guys like to fly around and play dress up.
I don't judge. It's easier that way.
any guys like to fly around and play rough?
Travis Slocum see something happen up here that wasn't poker or dress up?
something he just couldn't keep quiet about?
are you implying I'm trying to get away with something?
not implying, Gus. You are getting away with something.
you, uh, clearly don't understand Chemxtech's relationship with the troops, detective.
we have programs providing housing for vets who are homeless-- all kinds of outreach.
how did you reach out to Slocum?
okay.
let me give you a number. Protectanddefendurself.com.
twice? To go to prison twice?
just lucky, I guess.
you have such a positive attitude.
the second time wasn't for very long, was it?
not very long, no.
I don't know about these things, but is it normal to go in and out of jail so quickly?
prison.
not jail. Prison.
and you know what I learned there?
do tell.
I learned that I'm not this charming.
I'm sorry, "this charming"?
this.
your smile. Your laugh.
he's not this charming, believe me.
you think this is a joke.
you gotta laugh.
are you finished with these?
now what?
we laugh.
but first-- I gotta get back to work.
I got Bobby in the car.
tidwell called.
I'm back in uniform tomorrow.
he say Reese was coming back?
no.
got you some detective from Valley Division.
didn't get a name.
so this is your last day?
let's go catch us a killer, then.
what have you got, fries in there?
Gus Wilvern gave us your number.
protect and defend urself, inc.
who wants to know?
L.A.P.D.
how'd you get in my perimeter?
your mom.
real friendly.
let us right into your perimeter.
nice knives.
you know how to use 'em?
you have no right to be here.
I run an internet-based business.
you get security work for troops on leave.
everything I know is out of your realm of authority.
Travis Slocum isn't out of our realm of authority.
well, Slocum made enemies.
he slipped up.
should've known.
a military man must be on guard at all times.
and I do mean all times.
Travis Slocum was military.
you're not exactly military.
he gave you a hard time?
Slocum said the moron who kicked my army application was right.
I say bad judgment on his part, bad judgment on theirs, bad judgment breeds bad results.
I was never giving Slocum another referral.
you don't get out of this room much, do you, Pete?
flatfoot, you'd get your ass fragged in two seconds you ever saw any real action.
Fraggedy-ass.
you know Erin Cordett?
she sent me a text saying Slocum was sick, could she take his job.
she sent you a text?
what a vulture.
why would she be acceptable to the army and not me, huh?
you want to show us that text?
or should we make it our realm of authority?
where were you yesterday?
I was here.
earning my wages.
you may query my mother on that if you wish.
Erin lied to you about how she got on that plane.
Yeah, she went after Travis Slocum's job.
okay.
got prints off of that bong.
we going back to the motel?
this is the police.
we have a warrant for your arrest.
Quentin Norris, open up.
glasses.
find a lot of dead junkies in the shower.
something to do with wanting to get clean?
maybe.
well, hello, there.
they're grapes.
Yeah, but what kind of grape?
they're not red flame or thompson or concord or muscadine.
it's like all of 'em...perfect.
too perfect?
and evidence.
like all this other crapola.
so put 'em back.
well, it's juicy.
it's crisp. It's
a grape?
no, I--I don't think it is.
so what is it then?
Grape-Y.
Grape-ish.
yo, Charlie.
check this out.
new bills.
all rolled together.
junkie in the shower didn't look like the kind of guy to cash a paycheck.
check this out.
got blood on the blade that matches our victim slocum and ten grand in a potato chip can.
Norris was spreading some of that money around before the killing.
and Norris was military, too?
before our guys.
desert Storm.
in the '90s.
dishonorable discharge ten years ago.
history of assault, burglary-- all drug-related.
one combat vet kills another.
everything connected, Crews?
Ah, you do miss me, don't you, Reese?
how's the F.B.I. treating you?
uh, so far, just security clearance.
Oh, the lie detector, huh?
do you want to know how to beat that?
you can beat a lie detector?
sure, it's easy.
you just tell the truth.
tox screen came back.
the dead junkie-- his smack was cut with drain cleaner.
so someone paid Norris to kill Slocum, then someone killed Norris.
she was on the phone.
stuff I've seen, this doesn't look like a bad way to go.
friend of yours?
pretty sure he killed Travis.
I guess dreams do come true.
I was hoping for a sucking chest wound, though.
not drain cleaner?
somebody spiked his needle.
it wasn't you, was it?
you'd have shot him.
sir, yes, sir.
thing is, erin, "sir, yes, sirs" aside, turns out you're a liar.
first you tell us that you're here for sun and fun, but you're working.
then you tell us the agency called to take travis' job but you called them.
okay, I called.
Chemxtech pays best.
you know how to beat a lie detector, Erin?
Yeah, you tell the truth.
where were you last night when norris here got his hot shot?
in a bar.
what bar?
we went to a bunch of 'em.
all together?
that's right.
all together.
that's how we do it.
and it was just cash that made you want to get on that plane?
that's right.
and it was just cash that made Travis want to get on that plane?
that's right.
cause you see, Erin, we got two dead soldiers.
got lots of dead soldiers.
Yeah.
but I'm gonna find out why these two died.
well, that's where we're different, detective Crews.
we're trained not to ask why.
just gets in the way.
operation: Fun and sun.
why'd you need a vest?
I don't know why I'm talking to myself.
Chemxtech.
I'm still talking to myself.
Chemxtech.
Yeah, this is one of ours.
our polymer coating makes it light, but it's pretty much indestructible.
Yeah.
see this serial number?
this vest is three years old.
looks brand-new.
now, I don't think the soldier who wore it ever took a bullet.
see how straight the fibers run?
Where'd you get it?
it was Travis Slocum's.
and that's hard to believe.
two years in Iraq.
not a scratch.
you sell these to the army?
Oh, still a little pricey.
I convinced some friends at the pentagon to outfit a few platoons.
put the merchandise in their hands.
that's right. First rule of sales.
I want to show you something.
I'm just gonna step over here to set this up.
some day, you'll be wearing one of these.
when they're cheaper?
more we sell, the cheaper they get.
and this is how I sell 'em.
you know, lab tests-- they're fine.
you really want to sell something?
you ready for this?
bam! How great is that?
look at this. I've done this 115 times.
116 times.
117 times.
you can stop that now.
I'm gonna get in Guinness.
no man has ever shot himself more than I have.
you want to try?
go ahead.
taste one.
it's like nothing
it's nothing.
until I say it's something.
we extract the essence of grape and then reformulate the fruit body.
the fruit body?
it has an infinite shelf life.
it's not a grape.
not until Chemxtech says it is.
stays fresh until we inject the flavor.
that's not even on the market yet.
beautiful, ain't it?
Oh, yeah. It's beautiful.
this vest connects Travis to Chemxtech.
a lot of troops wear those vests.
these connect Norris to Chemxtech.
please do not ask me to go to the D. A. Holding just those grapes.
no, these aren't grapes.
just the fruit body.
and you won't have to.
the dead junkie, Quentin Norris, washed out of the army then bounced around the system.
got help from community outreach paid for by a generous grant from Chemxtech.
okay, so everything's connected.
the vest and the fruit bodies.
but how does it end up in the death of a decorated United States soldier?
decorated, but not a scratch on him.
two years in Iraq, but not a scratch on him.
that's what gus said.
sadr City...
you get one of these medals for getting wounded in combat.
now, if Travis wasn't wounded in combat, then
whose medal is it?
army sent this-- after action report.
there weren't always four members.
there was a fifth member of this squad in Sadr City.
wounded?
killed. Sniper fire.
chest wound.
died while Erin and Sims were carrying him to the chopper.
chest wound? W-wasn't he wearing one of them vests?
I mean, Gus showed you. Bullets don't go through 'em, right?
bullets don't go through the vest gus showed me, but...
maybe the vest gus showed me isn't the one they shipped overseas.
their buddy dies because of a bad Chemxtech vest.
they come over here to set it right.
all together.
that's how they do it.
sorry. Me again.
anybody seen Gus?
he's not here.
so the party's here, the plane's here, but the host is missing.
security detail is missing, too.
I'm looking for returns.
is Gus in his office?
Where's Erin and Sims?
do you?
move
I'm alive.
Yeah, you're alive.
Ah, I'm alive. I'm alive!
Where's Erin and Sims?
out that door.
where does it lead to?
through my private waiting room back out to the hallway.
are they armed?
Yeah. They got my guns.
they could be in any of those offices.
great to triangulate fire.
I'm alive.
Yeah, you're alive.
but we've still gotta get you out of here.
Erin, we know what happened to kit.
we know he died in Sadr City.
we know you were holding him when he did.
we know he was wearing a Chemxtech vest, and I know you asked why, Erin.
then you know you should send gus into the hall.
can't do that.
wow, Gus.
they really don't like you.
they broke in.
tied me up.
yeah? What did they want?
were they looking through all your files, Gus?
his vest killed Kit.
send Gus into the hall.
look, they're out of their minds.
our vests work. They save lives.
I mean, you've seen it yourself. They work.
for two years.
they work like a miracle for two years.
it'll stop everything for two years. And then
they stop stopping everything?
but the Chemxtech catalog says they got a she life of five years.
they do. They work for five years.
I got a dead friend that says they don't.
if you had a problem with the vest, why didn't you file a complaint?
I don't think they were looking for a class action suit, Gus.
the vests were Chemxtech, so we came here on leave.
Travis got in the deepest.
he got in their computers and traced the sale of the vests to him.
two days later
Travis Slocum was dead.
you get that junkie Quentin Norris to kill Slocum.
cause that's a man's job.
and then you killed Quentin Norris.
cause that was just drain cleaner.
detective, send him out, or we're gonna come in there and get him.
look, you gotta get me out of here.
backup's still a few minutes away.
what do you wanna do, Charlie?
what do you-- "what do you wanna do"?
you wanna get me out of here, that's what you wanna do!
okay.
let's get him out of here.
we'll take him down the hall.
put this on.
come on, let's go. Put it on.
there's no time for that.
come on. Put it on.
this was Travis'.
three years old.
it's still got two years left in it.
just keep your head down and tucked, hmm?
your vest should stop any fire.
come on, Gus.
you shot yourself 117 times.
I changed the numbers from two to five.
our lab reports said two years' shelf life, just like the other companies'.
the war was only supposed to last six weeks. Six weeks.
I mean, who knew we'd still be there six years later?
don't tell me.
tell them.
I changed the numbers from two to five.
who knew we'd still be there six years later?
I think your leave is probably up.
I think it probably is.
you asked me here to look at your tv.
well, we've never had one before.
what do you think?
also I'd like access to all the files you have on Mickey Rayborn.
let me think about that...
no.
I know I didn't kill him.
I think Roman Nevikov ordered it done.
but you spent a lot of time with Mickey Rayborn and I'd like to see some of what you've seen.
Oh, let me think about it again.
no.
not no.
Yes.
that's what I said when I used to make deals.
they would say no, and I would say, "not no. Yes."
be that as it may, I'm saying, "not yes. No."
Puryer investigations.
quite a business.
wealthy clients.
powerful clients.
you know why they use you?
my clients use me because of my reputation, detective.
don't you just love that accent?
everything sounds so smart.
so if you had no reputation, you would have no business.
you got a client who lives there?
come on, you do.
I know this kid-- lives with his mom, loves security, loves computers.
got us your client list-- your whole client list.
put up these cameras, too.
live feed.
Oh, look! There he is now.
and my client list?
what is that?
Oh, this is the button that makes me laugh.
do you want to push it?
Oh, okay, Ted, you-- go ahead.
go ahead, push it.
my reputation?
my client list.
my entire client list.
okay, detective.
I've seen your wall.
now let me show you mine.
these are our in-house security of Mr. Rayborn.
Oh, there you are, being taken out of his car.
what about the night he was killed?
system had been corrupted that night.
our cameras on his boats were inoperable.
what are these?
these are images I had taken off Mr. Rayborn's computer.
I haven't fully processed these yet.
who took these?
I don't know.
it was possible he was employing secondary security.
stop.
go back.
that one, there.
go full-screen on that one.
closer.
is that Dani Reese?
crews. Come in here.
you need something?
Yeah, I do. Close the door.
get the blinds. - The
the blinds, yeah. Close all the blinds.
I need you to stomp on my foot.
you need me to stomp on your foot? - Yeah.
it's asleep. My foot's asleep.
asleep, huh? Hate it when that happens. It'll be awake all night now.
are you gonna stomp on my foot or not?
come on. Give it more than that.
anything? - Nothing. Take it up a notch.
my second wife, she was really good at this.
must have been something about her shoes.
what about Reese?
I'm bringing her along.
got a tingle. Do it again.
now I'm feeling it. One more time.
Ah, yeah! There it is. Yeah.
there's a dead guy at the beach.
dead guy.
what was -- Don't ask.
do all detectives have to do that?
Bobby, let's go to the beach.
anybody see anything?
runner.
he was coming through the crowd, then he just dropped.
big blade, hmm. Buck knife?
looks serrated. He just dropped?
stabbed through the heart. Turned him off like a light.
robbery gone wrong? Shove a victim, slit his pockets, knife slips.
well, he's got no pockets to slit.
no pockets. So no I. D.
you go out for a run, you lock the door, right?
don't run much. - That much.
no pockets.
you lock the door, where do you put the key?
the sea sprite. Ocean front motel.
out-of-towners love this zoo.
what's not to love?
clearly you are not a parent.
out-of-towners on vacation.
not on vacation. On leave.
army.
if our dead guy is one of 'em, that leaves three more.
one of 'em's a real little guy.
or not a guy at all.
what?
can I help you with something?
those are nice sunglasses. You get those on the beach.
you get a lot of sunglasses on the beach. It's sunny there.
I'm gonna ask you again. Can I help you with something?
well, you can start by telling your two friends behind us to put their hands in the air and get down on their knees.
all active duty U. S. Army.
back from Iraq. In L.A. on leave.
and the victim?
they all surf together and they all came here together.
I only count three beds.
all four staying in this room?
said they could only afford the one room, so they rotated, taking turns on the floor.
what about that diversion attack they pulled on you two?
said they saw strangers in their room.
training just kicked in.
I don't mean to sound unpatriotic, but I see a cute girl sharing a room with three boys and now one of the boys is dead.
well, they all alibi each other.
said they were all hanging at the pool while Slocum went for his run.
what? What?
it's just-- Reese told me to
Reese told you to what, captain?
Reese told me to make sure I always ask you what you see.
Ah, she said that, did she?
so? What do you see?
actually, it's what I don't see.
she said he might say that.
you're not wearing dog tags?
you're all still on active duty, right?
how come you took off your tags?
when a policeman takes off his badge, in my experience, it usually means he's up to no good.
I see those tags.
took 'em off because we're not over there just now.
because we just wanted to be here for two weeks.
operation: Fun and sun.
wouldn't expect you to understand.
okay. Listen.
my captain out there-- he sees a pretty girl and you fellas in this room, he's thinking jealousy.
not robbery.
Travis and us? We surf together. Kick major ass together.
wouldn't expect you to understand.
you don't expect a lot, do you?
I get what I get, and I don't get upset, sir.
Travis Slocum. We're gonna have to take this with us.
I'll make sure these get where they need to go.
it's okay, Andy.
detective Crews will be respectful with that.
won't you, sir?
they're all from the midwest.
they all saw heavy action in Iraq.
this, however, is their first time in L. A.
dirty clothes. Dirty clothes, dirty clothes.
a souvenir glass with the letters "A. F.O." Stenciled on it.
does not mean "air force one." We should find out where this came from.
where there's drinking, there's arguments.
arguments, there's violence.
got a lightweight protective vest in good condition. Very light.
and... - And what?
a medal for exceptional valor.
sadr city, Iraq, April 12, 2008. Victim was a hero.
and Tidwell thinks it's about the girl?
in the United States of New York City, where there's a dead guy, there's a girl there somewhere.
well, what do you think?
well, I think you put a knife into Slocum's heart like that, you need training to get that close without being seen, or he needs to know you, so
so you can get that close without causing any alarm.
and Travis' buddies -- Knew him and had the training.
Hey, Reese.
Reese, you said something nice about me to Tidwell, huh?
no, I didn't.
you know, Reese. With distance, you're appreciating me more.
well, that's just rude.
you know she's not here, right?
you get the video? - Yeah. It should be up now.
you can't see Reese here in this room, can you? I mean, is she -- is she here now?
so many people. Can't tell who got close to him and who didn't.
nobody saw him get stabbed.
nobody even noticed him till he fell.
nobody saw anything. I showed these pictures to everybody.
I even talked to the human statue.
Oh, yeah? What'd he say?
it was a girl.
said she didn't really look at the faces staring at her.
what's she looking at?
watching films in her head.
godfather iii today.
isn't that the worst one? - Yeah.
since she watched the other two, she likes to finish things, and
Slocum runs into this crowd alive, and he comes out dead.
how do you kill a guy like that?
okay. I'm Slocum. I'm jogging this way.
What--I just come up, stick you in the chest?
battle-tested soldier?
doesn't seem right.
you don't see Reese again, do you? Is she here now, Charlie?
how do you kill a guy like that?
he's been stabbed by-- here, maybe, two, three seconds.
wind it back.
you can't see him now. - We're not looking for him.
he gets stabbed right about... now.
there. Look at that. See the musician here?
she's turning up her amp.
this vendor spills his ice.
and these two guys here at the table, they start pushing each other.
all at the same time.
he said it was performance art.
he asked you to argue?
when we got a text, we started.
same with you?
Yeah, he did. He said it was performance art. He gave me $100.
paid you, too? What'd he look like?
white guy, sunglasses, hoodie.
could be. But, uh, like he said, he had a hoodie and sunglasses.
you remember anything else?
Yeah, he was a tough sale.
you tried to sell him something?
big bad Bertha. Since he had all that money.
but I couldn't get him to buy it.
you get him to touch it? - I did.
always put the merchandise in their hands.
first rule of sales.
you want to get that dusted for prints? - I do.
a diversion.
get Slocum's attention going one way, then push that knife right in his heart and no one sees it.
or the killer.
we've seen a diversion before, haven't we?
let's try this again. Do you know this man?
Yes.
you know his name?
Mickey Rayborn. - How do you know Mickey Rayborn?
I've seen him in the papers.
the stories about his murder? - Yes.
do you know him in any other way besides the stories in the paper?
Yes.
in what other way do you know Mickey Rayborn?
he was some kind of famous cop before I got on the force.
do you know Mickey Rayborn in any other way besides for him being some kind of famous cop?
Yes.
in what way would that be?
detective, your answers will not be used against you.
the bureau needs to know your secrets so no one will use them against me.
that's right. - Yeah.
in what other way do you know Mickey Rayborn, then?
he and my father were friends.
they were both cops?
Yes.
and where is your father now?
I don't know. He took off.
there is a detail left out of the newspaper articles about Rayborn's death.
do you know what it is?
no.
his body was never found.
as a detective, what's that mean to you?
all that blood in the water nearby, um...
I'm guessing he was butchered.
butchered.
do you know this man?
damn it, I can't do it.
watch movies in your head?
takes practice.
I used to be really good at it.
when you were inside?
godfather iii? - No.
home movies.
I'm guessing that must have hurt.
I'm guessing that's why I watched 'em.
take a look at that.
where is she going dressed like that?
why'd they take their dog tags off?
that's, like, a giant private jet.
come on. Let's follow her.
don't have a warrant or a ticket.
come on, the door's open. We can just walk on.
that plane, you don't need a ticket if you look like you have a ticket.
no, Charlie, you don't need a ticket because you look like you have a ticket.
me? I need a ticket.
okay.
keep your phone on. I'll call you when I land.
Jerry, that number's a joke.
Jerry, that number's so small I can't even see it.
wait, wait, do I see it? No. It's too small. False alarm. Bye, Jerry.
Jerry.
cell phone. Cell phone, sir.
thank you.
welcome to air fun one.
A. F.O.
is there anything else you'd like?
well, if it's a specific question, I don't need anything, but if it's a more general question
excuse me.
sometimes I think I don't need anything, but I do. I just don't know it.
well, is this what I need?
I need you off this plane.
you're not supposed to be here.
you're not supposed to be here, either.
why'd you take your dog tags off, Erin?
you know why. I'm working security.
which is against army regs. - I need the money.
I've been making less than minimum wage for two years.
a lot less. We all have.
everyone? You've got to be seated.
uh, one moment please. I'm just having some trouble with my... fastener.
okay. Listen. Travis was working this plane. You're working this plane.
anything you think I should know about what happens on this plane?
the service called me this morning. They thought travis flaked.
I didn't say what happened to him. It's none of their business.
I need the money. That's why we came.
but now Travis is dead.
Yeah. Travis is dead.
but I still need the money.
Erin, where's this plane going?
it doesn't really go anywhere.
so it's just a flying party where people get contracts signed?
why'd they take our phones?
because they all have cameras in 'em now.
you can sit there for takeoff.
the Way You Want
what if I don't know the way I want what I want?
you don't know what you want.
maybe I can help you figure it out.
Gus Wilvern. Chemxtech.
vice president, customer relations. And you are?
really, really enjoying this plane.
well, you'd have a disorder if you weren't.
and your name is? - Charlie Crews.
that Charlie Crews?
no, this Charlie Crews.
eh, falsely-accused Charlie Crews.
no, detective Charlie Crews.
you look a lot different in person.
I am a lot different in person.
a lot different in person. That's excellent.
I gotta ask you, though, who'd you come on board with?
Oh, just me.
and this murder investigation I got going on.
Slocum worked security for you.
temp. Didn't show up this morning. Our Slocum. Murdered.
here, after everything he'd been through.
maybe you wanna go easy.
just one more bottle. They're very tiny. We have the big ones.
people seem to prefer the little ones.
just nostalgia, I guess.
why did Travis work here?
Oh, these kids-- they get paid nothing on active duty.
I try and help 'em out when they're on leave. Between me and them.
so you pay 'em under the table?
they're not supposed to moonlight.
it's better for 'em. - And you.
anything that happens up here they can't talk about, can they?
what would happen up here?
Gus, you've got grown men up here walking around dressed up as cowboys and gladiators.
some guys like to fly around and play poker.
some guys like to fly around and play dress up.
I don't judge. It's easier that way.
any guys like to fly around and play rough?
Travis Slocum see something happen up here that wasn't poker or dress up?
something he just couldn't keep quiet about?
are you implying I'm trying to get away with something?
not implying, Gus. You are getting away with something.
you, uh, clearly don't understand Chemxtech's relationship with the troops, detective.
we have programs providing housing for vets who are homeless-- all kinds of outreach.
how did you reach out to Slocum?
okay.
let me give you a number. Protectanddefendurself.com.
twice? To go to prison twice?
just lucky, I guess.
you have such a positive attitude.
the second time wasn't for very long, was it?
not very long, no.
I don't know about these things, but is it normal to go in and out of jail so quickly?
prison.
not jail. Prison.
and you know what I learned there?
do tell.
I learned that I'm not this charming.
I'm sorry, "this charming"?
this.
your smile. Your laugh.
he's not this charming, believe me.
you think this is a joke.
you gotta laugh.
are you finished with these?
now what?
we laugh.
but first-- I gotta get back to work.
I got Bobby in the car.
tidwell called.
I'm back in uniform tomorrow.
he say Reese was coming back?
no.
got you some detective from Valley Division.
didn't get a name.
so this is your last day?
let's go catch us a killer, then.
what have you got, fries in there?
Gus Wilvern gave us your number.
protect and defend urself, inc.
who wants to know?
L.A.P.D.
how'd you get in my perimeter?
your mom.
real friendly.
let us right into your perimeter.
nice knives.
you know how to use 'em?
you have no right to be here.
I run an internet-based business.
you get security work for troops on leave.
everything I know is out of your realm of authority.
Travis Slocum isn't out of our realm of authority.
well, Slocum made enemies.
he slipped up.
should've known.
a military man must be on guard at all times.
and I do mean all times.
Travis Slocum was military.
you're not exactly military.
he gave you a hard time?
Slocum said the moron who kicked my army application was right.
I say bad judgment on his part, bad judgment on theirs, bad judgment breeds bad results.
I was never giving Slocum another referral.
you don't get out of this room much, do you, Pete?
flatfoot, you'd get your ass fragged in two seconds you ever saw any real action.
Fraggedy-ass.
you know Erin Cordett?
she sent me a text saying Slocum was sick, could she take his job.
she sent you a text?
what a vulture.
why would she be acceptable to the army and not me, huh?
you want to show us that text?
or should we make it our realm of authority?
where were you yesterday?
I was here.
earning my wages.
you may query my mother on that if you wish.
Erin lied to you about how she got on that plane.
Yeah, she went after Travis Slocum's job.
okay.
got prints off of that bong.
we going back to the motel?
this is the police.
we have a warrant for your arrest.
Quentin Norris, open up.
glasses.
find a lot of dead junkies in the shower.
something to do with wanting to get clean?
maybe.
well, hello, there.
they're grapes.
Yeah, but what kind of grape?
they're not red flame or thompson or concord or muscadine.
it's like all of 'em...perfect.
too perfect?
and evidence.
like all this other crapola.
so put 'em back.
well, it's juicy.
it's crisp. It's
a grape?
no, I--I don't think it is.
so what is it then?
Grape-Y.
Grape-ish.
yo, Charlie.
check this out.
new bills.
all rolled together.
junkie in the shower didn't look like the kind of guy to cash a paycheck.
check this out.
got blood on the blade that matches our victim slocum and ten grand in a potato chip can.
Norris was spreading some of that money around before the killing.
and Norris was military, too?
before our guys.
desert Storm.
in the '90s.
dishonorable discharge ten years ago.
history of assault, burglary-- all drug-related.
one combat vet kills another.
everything connected, Crews?
Ah, you do miss me, don't you, Reese?
how's the F.B.I. treating you?
uh, so far, just security clearance.
Oh, the lie detector, huh?
do you want to know how to beat that?
you can beat a lie detector?
sure, it's easy.
you just tell the truth.
tox screen came back.
the dead junkie-- his smack was cut with drain cleaner.
so someone paid Norris to kill Slocum, then someone killed Norris.
she was on the phone.
stuff I've seen, this doesn't look like a bad way to go.
friend of yours?
pretty sure he killed Travis.
I guess dreams do come true.
I was hoping for a sucking chest wound, though.
not drain cleaner?
somebody spiked his needle.
it wasn't you, was it?
you'd have shot him.
sir, yes, sir.
thing is, erin, "sir, yes, sirs" aside, turns out you're a liar.
first you tell us that you're here for sun and fun, but you're working.
then you tell us the agency called to take travis' job but you called them.
okay, I called.
Chemxtech pays best.
you know how to beat a lie detector, Erin?
Yeah, you tell the truth.
where were you last night when norris here got his hot shot?
in a bar.
what bar?
we went to a bunch of 'em.
all together?
that's right.
all together.
that's how we do it.
and it was just cash that made you want to get on that plane?
that's right.
and it was just cash that made Travis want to get on that plane?
that's right.
cause you see, Erin, we got two dead soldiers.
got lots of dead soldiers.
Yeah.
but I'm gonna find out why these two died.
well, that's where we're different, detective Crews.
we're trained not to ask why.
just gets in the way.
operation: Fun and sun.
why'd you need a vest?
I don't know why I'm talking to myself.
Chemxtech.
I'm still talking to myself.
Chemxtech.
Yeah, this is one of ours.
our polymer coating makes it light, but it's pretty much indestructible.
Yeah.
see this serial number?
this vest is three years old.
looks brand-new.
now, I don't think the soldier who wore it ever took a bullet.
see how straight the fibers run?
Where'd you get it?
it was Travis Slocum's.
and that's hard to believe.
two years in Iraq.
not a scratch.
you sell these to the army?
Oh, still a little pricey.
I convinced some friends at the pentagon to outfit a few platoons.
put the merchandise in their hands.
that's right. First rule of sales.
I want to show you something.
I'm just gonna step over here to set this up.
some day, you'll be wearing one of these.
when they're cheaper?
more we sell, the cheaper they get.
and this is how I sell 'em.
you know, lab tests-- they're fine.
you really want to sell something?
you ready for this?
bam! How great is that?
look at this. I've done this 115 times.
116 times.
117 times.
you can stop that now.
I'm gonna get in Guinness.
no man has ever shot himself more than I have.
you want to try?
go ahead.
taste one.
it's like nothing
it's nothing.
until I say it's something.
we extract the essence of grape and then reformulate the fruit body.
the fruit body?
it has an infinite shelf life.
it's not a grape.
not until Chemxtech says it is.
stays fresh until we inject the flavor.
that's not even on the market yet.
beautiful, ain't it?
Oh, yeah. It's beautiful.
this vest connects Travis to Chemxtech.
a lot of troops wear those vests.
these connect Norris to Chemxtech.
please do not ask me to go to the D. A. Holding just those grapes.
no, these aren't grapes.
just the fruit body.
and you won't have to.
the dead junkie, Quentin Norris, washed out of the army then bounced around the system.
got help from community outreach paid for by a generous grant from Chemxtech.
okay, so everything's connected.
the vest and the fruit bodies.
but how does it end up in the death of a decorated United States soldier?
decorated, but not a scratch on him.
two years in Iraq, but not a scratch on him.
that's what gus said.
sadr City...
you get one of these medals for getting wounded in combat.
now, if Travis wasn't wounded in combat, then
whose medal is it?
army sent this-- after action report.
there weren't always four members.
there was a fifth member of this squad in Sadr City.
wounded?
killed. Sniper fire.
chest wound.
died while Erin and Sims were carrying him to the chopper.
chest wound? W-wasn't he wearing one of them vests?
I mean, Gus showed you. Bullets don't go through 'em, right?
bullets don't go through the vest gus showed me, but...
maybe the vest gus showed me isn't the one they shipped overseas.
their buddy dies because of a bad Chemxtech vest.
they come over here to set it right.
all together.
that's how they do it.
sorry. Me again.
anybody seen Gus?
he's not here.
so the party's here, the plane's here, but the host is missing.
security detail is missing, too.
I'm looking for returns.
is Gus in his office?
Where's Erin and Sims?
do you?
move
I'm alive.
Yeah, you're alive.
Ah, I'm alive. I'm alive!
Where's Erin and Sims?
out that door.
where does it lead to?
through my private waiting room back out to the hallway.
are they armed?
Yeah. They got my guns.
they could be in any of those offices.
great to triangulate fire.
I'm alive.
Yeah, you're alive.
but we've still gotta get you out of here.
Erin, we know what happened to kit.
we know he died in Sadr City.
we know you were holding him when he did.
we know he was wearing a Chemxtech vest, and I know you asked why, Erin.
then you know you should send gus into the hall.
can't do that.
wow, Gus.
they really don't like you.
they broke in.
tied me up.
yeah? What did they want?
were they looking through all your files, Gus?
his vest killed Kit.
send Gus into the hall.
look, they're out of their minds.
our vests work. They save lives.
I mean, you've seen it yourself. They work.
for two years.
they work like a miracle for two years.
it'll stop everything for two years. And then
they stop stopping everything?
but the Chemxtech catalog says they got a she life of five years.
they do. They work for five years.
I got a dead friend that says they don't.
if you had a problem with the vest, why didn't you file a complaint?
I don't think they were looking for a class action suit, Gus.
the vests were Chemxtech, so we came here on leave.
Travis got in the deepest.
he got in their computers and traced the sale of the vests to him.
two days later
Travis Slocum was dead.
you get that junkie Quentin Norris to kill Slocum.
cause that's a man's job.
and then you killed Quentin Norris.
cause that was just drain cleaner.
detective, send him out, or we're gonna come in there and get him.
look, you gotta get me out of here.
backup's still a few minutes away.
what do you wanna do, Charlie?
what do you-- "what do you wanna do"?
you wanna get me out of here, that's what you wanna do!
okay.
let's get him out of here.
we'll take him down the hall.
put this on.
come on, let's go. Put it on.
there's no time for that.
come on. Put it on.
this was Travis'.
three years old.
it's still got two years left in it.
just keep your head down and tucked, hmm?
your vest should stop any fire.
come on, Gus.
you shot yourself 117 times.
I changed the numbers from two to five.
our lab reports said two years' shelf life, just like the other companies'.
the war was only supposed to last six weeks. Six weeks.
I mean, who knew we'd still be there six years later?
don't tell me.
tell them.
I changed the numbers from two to five.
who knew we'd still be there six years later?
I think your leave is probably up.
I think it probably is.
you asked me here to look at your tv.
well, we've never had one before.
what do you think?
also I'd like access to all the files you have on Mickey Rayborn.
let me think about that...
no.
I know I didn't kill him.
I think Roman Nevikov ordered it done.
but you spent a lot of time with Mickey Rayborn and I'd like to see some of what you've seen.
Oh, let me think about it again.
no.
not no.
Yes.
that's what I said when I used to make deals.
they would say no, and I would say, "not no. Yes."
be that as it may, I'm saying, "not yes. No."
Puryer investigations.
quite a business.
wealthy clients.
powerful clients.
you know why they use you?
my clients use me because of my reputation, detective.
don't you just love that accent?
everything sounds so smart.
so if you had no reputation, you would have no business.
you got a client who lives there?
come on, you do.
I know this kid-- lives with his mom, loves security, loves computers.
got us your client list-- your whole client list.
put up these cameras, too.
live feed.
Oh, look! There he is now.
and my client list?
what is that?
Oh, this is the button that makes me laugh.
do you want to push it?
Oh, okay, Ted, you-- go ahead.
go ahead, push it.
my reputation?
my client list.
my entire client list.
okay, detective.
I've seen your wall.
now let me show you mine.
these are our in-house security of Mr. Rayborn.
Oh, there you are, being taken out of his car.
what about the night he was killed?
system had been corrupted that night.
our cameras on his boats were inoperable.
what are these?
these are images I had taken off Mr. Rayborn's computer.
I haven't fully processed these yet.
who took these?
I don't know.
it was possible he was employing secondary security.
stop.
go back.
that one, there.
go full-screen on that one.
closer.
is that Dani Reese?
fakes are easy. Any kid with a computer and a printer can do it.
it's not a fake.
this girl I knew sent me a picture of herself once.
she had this devil tail.
it looked real, but it wasn't.
Ted, I had that photo checked. It's real.
it's reese with Rayborn three days before someone spilled his blood all over his boat.
well, what are you going to do? You gotta do something.
do you want me to do something? I can do something.
you gotta do something. Don't you?
I'm going to work.
nice tat. Where'd you get it?
your mother gave it to me. - Yeah?
my mother didn't do time in Atwater.
what do you know about Atwater?
Atwater's a cakewalk.
compared to what?
crescent city.
pelican bay crescent city? You don't seem like no guard.
wasn't no guard.
you were in pelican bay? No way.
where do you think I learned this?
what years? - '94 to '06.
Atwater. '98 to '08.
Oh, we got a dead woman upstairs.
I know.
got her blood on your boots.
I know.
is one of you Charlie Crews?
I am. Who wants to know?
Jane Seever. Detective Jane Seever.
your new partner.
wanna switch places?
he was hiding out on the bathroom ledge?
not at first.
he was with the body when he heard the uniforms down the hall.
he lives here.
and then he went out on the ledge?
Yes, but it was too far to jump.
so he climbed back in and tried to walk right out the front door?
Yes, most escapees just walk right out.
but you followed him.
saw the blood on his boots.
and he stopped walking and he ran.
he ran because he killed her?
well, screams were his.
which screams?
the screams the neighbors heard.
they heard a man. Not a woman.
place was a mess when the unis got here.
someone tossed it.
why were you holding that knife?
dropped my gun.
so why didn't you just pick it up?
you know what, stop. Can we start again?
okay, he was on the bathroom ledge.
Oh, no, no, before that.
Hi, I'm detective Seever.
I'm detective Crews.
it is an honor to meet you.
okay.
but just to be clear, you're not.
not what? - My new partner.
I have a partner. Two partners.
of course you do.
officer Robert Stark and detective Dani Reese.
did a little studying.
Oh, like to be prepared. - Measure twice. Cut once.
you know, I actually only got serious about being prepared in law school.
law school.
Yes, it's part of my plan.
which plan is that?
my 15-year plan. To be mayor.
mayor.
law school first. Then detective. Then chief of police. Then mayor.
how's that going so far?
you know, I mean, I got sidetracked, you know, a few years back, but I'm back on course now.
went through a dark time?
no, no, Olympics.
I mean, just the relay, but, still, it took time.
olympics.
just the relay.
15-year plan.
Yeah, you got one?
no, not exactly.
you spent a lot of time in prison, John.
armed robbery.
that jewelry store in 1997.
you got out last year. Now this.
I know what it looks like.
Yeah, it looks like you killed her.
Yeah, 'cause her blood was on me.
well, that, and you being there and suddenly not wanting to be there.
this girl had a job at a news station.
this girl paid her taxes.
this girl had pretty dresses in her closet.
pretty smile on her face.
she was dead when I got there.
look, the place was torn up.
I found her, I was holding her, I heard those cops.
I know what it looks like.
Yeah, but what were you doing there, John?
what's a convict like you doing in a pretty girl's loft?
you know you shouldn't be there, right. You're not supposed to touch that stuff.
she wanted me there.
where did you meet a girl like this?
she wrote me when I was in Atwater.
I wrote her back.
she just decided to write you. - Yup.
you never met her before. - Nope.
I got out a few months ago.
we started seeing each other.
look, I was at the movies last night.
anybody with you?
I was by myself. I like to do that.
okay, so this girl just decides she has to write a convict and picks you.
lots of girls do it.
lots of girls do it?
lots of girls do it.
can we talk outside for a minute?
what? - You're one of them, huh?
come on, John.
those girls on the outside send those letters. You're that guy.
the one who writes back.
I posted my name. She wrote me.
looking for what, John? Looking to save someone.
looking to find the sensitive soul inside the convict.
she liked you on the page, John. How'd she like you in the bedroom?
I didn't kill her.
you write her every day?
like she was the one you needed? - Yeah.
the only one you needed?
but she wasn't, was she?
how many others were there? - One.
I only wrote one other woman.
every day?
like she was the one you needed?
like she was the only one you needed, huh.
you stop writing her after you got out?
you ever go see her after you got out? - No.
how'd she take that? - How the Do you think she took it?
how do you know me? Ham?
because. You're that guy.
Yup.
Hey, john, what's your handicap?
what? - Golf. What's your handicap?
three.
this guy?
Sally never mentioned this guy.
he said they were together.
well, if they were, she never told anyone in the office.
well, he said she wrote him every day he was in prison.
and he killed her?
how long did sally work here, Sam?
three years now.
and what did she do?
she was real good at it too.
and how well did you know her?
I was her boss. We'd have lunch.
Sally wasn't the kind of person to get involved with a convict.
what kind of person was she?
a nice person. But now she's dead.
so what's she like?
she's just a regular detective.
regular? How regular?
regular. Regular regular.
Yes, yes, that's exactly what I mean.
they give you a partner? - No.
I'm working on my own.
perfect. All right. Great. Thank you.
Oh, anything interesting?
not really.
you know the feds. It's just a bunch of paperwork.
paperwork?
Yeah. Yeah, lots of it.
I should go.
settling in?
Yeah, I checked out the movie flowers said he was at last night.
it played when he said it did.
no staff remembers seeing him, so that doesn't prove anything either way.
a search of Sally Murdoch and John Flowers's place hasn't turned up any letters.
he still swears they wrote each other.
prisons keep track of that?
prisons barely keep track of their prisoners.
we should. - Already done.
I located the other woman that Flowers said he corresponded with.
Oh, and I got you this. I think that's how you like it.
it is. Five sugars. How'd you know?
she likes to be prepared.
I asked around, and no one knew what you liked. I guessed tea.
we should go. Traffic's going to be getting bad soon, so...
not Reese. Definitely not Reese.
okay, at the crime scene you said they were his screams.
you wrote down what I said?
I write down a lot of things.
part of your plan? - Yes.
why ask his handicap?
you write that down too?
but you weren't even in the room.
I was watching from the monitor.
and about you walking me out of the room like that...
a very effective technique.
I mean, do you use that a lot or...
okay, the screams being his.
maybe they came in after, maybe they were just grief, but why ask his handicap?
the jewelry store heist that Flowers went away for?
what job did he do on that crew?
he broke open the safe.
safecrackers typically have a healthy respect for their tools.
a golfer as good as he is does not.
take a 3-iron to someone's head.
and don't write down what I say.
do not write that down.
look, I know I'm not your partner. Okay?
there's no organized crime task force.
you brought me here for this.
no, there is an organized crime task force.
and this is part of it.
okay, where's your father, detective?
he left your mother, took off.
that's what the note said yes?
we're not asking you to be a rat, detective.
just a cop. I know this is hard.
but there are some things you need to believe.
every day, five pages, ten pages.
for five years. Thousands of pages.
millions of his words he poured up into me.
they went right up into me.
I'd never been filled like that before.
what was it about him?
his need. Was raw.
and hot.
his need for what?
to connect.
he filled me all the way up.
it was like a wire humming up inside of me.
and after he got out?
I assumed he was strong.
he stopped writing.
he could stand on his own.
but he wasn't standing on his own.
he was standing with her, Amy.
he wrote her too.
poured his words up into her. Filled her up.
I knew he was with her. - You wanted him too.
I wanted him to be happy.
is that how you felt then?
a man does that to me, I kneecap him or her.
I was angry. But it was selfish.
it was just about me. And I'm not angry now.
Amy, is that John up there?
Yes. It is.
you've made him into a saint.
the lowest of us are.
where were you last night, Amy?
here. With my lord.
John didn't write or call you after he was released.
how about after we arrested him? He call you then?
no. I guess he didn't need me.
Thanks.
she'd do anything for Flowers.
if Flowers didn't call her after we arrested him, who did he call?
okay, got it.
after we arrested Flowers, he made a phone call, lasted six seconds.
the number belongs to a Nina fiske.
you get Nina's address? - Yeah.
this you can write down.
I don't wanna die!
I'm not ready to die!
I don't want to die!
I'm not ready. I'm not ready to die.
I don't wanna die. I don't want to die.
we're taking a break. And I'm having a piss.
this is a play you've written?
Yes.
about prison?
it's about redemption. It just takes place in prison.
are there any jokes in it? You should put some jokes in it.
you write anything else, Nina?
like what?
like letters to John Flowers.
when he was in prison.
we know John called you, Nina, after he got busted.
the call lasted pix seconds.
someone hang up on somebody?
you hang up on him?
John and I wrote to each other every day for years.
he gets out, I ever hear from him again.
until he gets arrested.
he called me, he asked for my help, and I hung up on him.
what about redemption?
this play's not about John.
where were you last night?
I was here. At rehearsal.
which I need to get back to.
I'll think about what you said. About those jokes.
three women. That's the name of your play?
Yes.
I know this story, don't I?
well, it's a true story.
Len lyle hix goes to prison for 20 years for killing three women.
beats them to death with a bat.
those are the facts, not the story.
the story's about redemption?
Yeah, that's right. Redemption.
well, let's put John back in the box, find out why he never mentioned Nina.
you get Flowers back from county?
little hitch with that.
when he got to county, our friend Flowers asked for another phone call.
he called in his own transfer to minimum security, hospital wing.
and then he just walked away.
escaped?
Nina, John's gonna need support.
he reached out for you before, and he's gonna do it again.
when John calls you, that call's gotta last more than six seconds, you understand me?
Yeah, I understand, detective.
flowers wrote all three women? - Yup.
promised them all the world? - Yup.
women write you? - Yup.
you write 'em back? - No.
what's she doing?
Speed-reading.
12 pages a minute. I counted.
maybe she's a robot.
have you seen her blink?
robots don't blink.
blinked. - Saw that.
transcripts from Flowers's trial.
I'll do a summary, but I think you should see this.
page 73, paragraph four.
Flowers's partner pulled the heist.
they get caught ten hours later, but the diamonds are never found.
and the dead girl's apartment was torn up like someone was looking for something.
Where's Flowers's partner now?
what's that smell? - Disinfectant.
underneath it. - Need.
never been in one of these before. - Neither have I.
need? I didn't think need had a smell.
honey pot, you ready for papa bear?
cops. I don't want cops.
Where's my honey pot?
this is my court-ordered conjugal rights hour.
Where's my honey pot?
well, your hour's now 59 minutes long, but the faster you talk, the faster we leave.
or we can take it outside where everybody'd see you talking to cops.
you know what, let's do that anyway.
I don't like the smell in here.
look, I just want my honey pot.
you pulled that jewelry heist together.
he got out.
you're still in here.
I had a longer sentence.
well, you shouldn't have broken that cop's arm when they arrested you.
Yeah, I know that now.
you should have gone easy like John.
I hear John's not so easy anymore, is he?
heard he killed a woman.
you hear where he might happen to be?
no.
those diamonds you stole, any idea where they are?
you know, a funny thing about those diamonds, you see, I thought John had 'em, he thought I had 'em.
that is funny.
this, though, not so funny.
flowers whack her?
damn.
you know her.
how do you know her?
she wrote to me.
like a lot of them other girls do.
you write back?
just once and that was it.
not your type? - For two reasons.
one, she asked me the wrong question. - Really.
and what would that be?
what was I thinking?
and number two, she was too old.
girl's gotta be half my age, minus three years, tops.
now I'm 40, and I want my honey pot.
Papa bear.
Ooh, pudding.
I don't think honey pot has a 15-year plan.
these girls just write anybody?
no, they won't.
but Sally Murdoch wrote to the two men that were involved in that jewelry heist, and now Sally Murdoch is dead.
what's he doing?
reading.
slowly.
very, very slowly.
just so you know...
I'm not a robot.
anything interesting in there?
our dead girl is in here.
well, that's impossible. I read that transcript.
there's no mention of Sally Murdoch in there.
read the whole thing?
read the last page?
well, that's not part of the trial. It's just the signature page. It's the judge, bailiff...
court reporter.
Sally Murdoch, court reporter.
our victim was the court reporter.
our victim was the court reporter.
John Flowers goes to trial for a jewelry store heist from which the diamonds are never found.
Sally Murdoch, the court reporter from that trial, starts writing Flowers, and then he moves in with her when he gets out of prison.
and then she gets beaten to death.
flowers beat her to death.
his blood, his prints, his diamonds.
well, I'll be damned.
she brought him in.
didn't mention who Sally was last time we were in this room, John.
no, I didn't.
can you guess why?
it would look like she was working you for the diamonds, you found out about it, and you killed her.
but I didn't.
when did you figure out sally was the court reporter at your trial?
we swapped a few letters.
she came to visit.
and I remembered her face.
from the trial.
Yeah, I looked at her. A lot.
didn't want to be there.
don't let this go to trial, John.
don't fight us. Work with us.
let's work together on this, okay?
work together?
you mean you want me to say that I killed her?
then we can help you.
look, you did the right thing letting Nina bring you in here.
don't stop now.
look, I knew Sally was working me, okay.
I didn't care.
I don't know where those diamonds are.
you tell Sally that?
no, I didn't.
you don't have the diamonds.
you don't tell Sally you don't have the diamonds.
why exactly is that?
because...
I'm that guy.
which guy is that, John?
the guy who does anything to get by.
promise promise.
and what about sally?
I don't know where those diamonds are, but I did know she'd keep looking.
so you knew she'd never leave.
I loved her.
she was the face I looked at when I was on trial.
so what's gonna happen now?
they're gonna charge you with murder, and they will find you guilty.
evidence, motive, your record.
you will be found guilty, John, and you will spend the rest of your life in prison.
that true?
so she's working out?
Yeah, she's doing okay.
well, don't forget about me.
I won't.
so he killed her because she was working him for the diamonds?
Yeah, looks like it.
you don't think so?
sometimes things are just what they look like. Right?
Yeah, Reese, sometimes things are just what they look like.
I should get back to work.
see ya, Reese.
Yeah. See ya, Crews.
what was reese doing on that boat with Rayborn, Charlie?
that's not the question.
what is the question then?
what's she doing at the FBI?
we're just asking you to be a cop.
Amy from the church wants to save his soul.
Sally, the court reporter, wants his diamonds.
what does Nina want from john flowers?
you know, I don't think I really understand this.
the three women that Len Lyle hix killed are all one woman.
sometimes they're the guard, sometimes they're his cellmate, and sometimes. - Sometimes I think they're even Len Lyle.
but I'm not so sure about that last part.
it's confusing.
take a look at this.
come here.
so in the play your character's in the electric chair.
that's right.
old sparky.
but of course, you yourself were never in the electric chair.
not my body. My soul, man.
in that chair. Every day.
ready to die.
now watch this.
here's my favorite part.
how did you two meet?
I wrote to Len Lyle.
and I wrote back.
and she wrote to the parole board.
Yes, I did.
it had become clear that Len Lyle was not the man that went to prison 20 years ago.
she's a...
real good writer, man.
how come he's not saying anything?
he's communing.
commuting?
communing. With death.
okay. Thanks.
who is he now?
the three dead girls or the killer?
he's all four of them.
and the guard too?
Yes. And the guard too.
so hard to understand.
you gotta watch it more than once.
what kind of bat did you use when you did those three girls?
it doesn't say in the program.
you're that cop.
I have a question.
now if you don't have a bat, can you use a 3-iron?
let's take it outside.
what would be the fun in that?
excuse me.
excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt the program, everyone, although, I think we know how it ends.
but we have a very special guest with us tonight.
another sweet product of a sour system.
ladies and gentlemen, Charlie Crews.
looks like your work, Len Lyle.
imitation.
flattery.
you know. Poor girl.
you say a 3-iron did that?
where were you last night?
publicity tour. Oakland.
you having a good time?
I'm having a great time.
how about you?
so what do you think?
I think Len Lyle hix does not have a healthy respect for his tools.
you think.
you think he finds out about it from Nina and then goes after Sally?
cause those three girls that Len Lyle killed with that bat, he stole a total of like $43 off 'em.
those diamonds were probably really tempting.
what do you think?
I think we should think about what Len Lyle was thinking about.
he's thinking,"did Sally work alone? Or did she have a partner?"
now if she had a partner, maybe I want to talk to that person too.
a partner.
okay. Okay.
Sally was writing John Flowers letters for just about three years.
Sally also worked at that news station for just about three years.
I can drive if you want.
no, it's okay.
I'm a good driver.
I'm sure you are.
okay.
how good are you?
stock car open wheel.
a guy I used to date kinda won the indy 500. Taught me a few things.
15-year plan to be mayor?
I have your vote?
I'll think about it.
you drive.
now we can talk here or back down at the police station.
I told you everything I know.
if it's the station, just s you know, we put you in the car, we turn the light on, people see, your boss finds out, it goes in your file.
maybe I should talk to a lawyer.
I'm a lawyer. So you're talking to one right now.
let's get in the car.
okay, okay.
Sally told me about the trial and about the diamonds.
we had done a story about women who write men in prison.
I told her to write the guy and see if she could find out where the diamonds are.
I told her that she should turn them in, if she found them, for the reward.
the reward.
well, good for you, Sam.
you know what's a better reward than money?
doing good.
you know why?
because when you do good, you feel good.
when you do bad, you feel bad.
this guy right here, he feels bad a lot.
I don't know him.
he didn't come round asking about the diamonds?
he's a pretty scary-looking guy.
maybe he sent someone else to ask his questions.
you ever see her?
her I know. She's that writer.
which writer is that?
she was writing a play about the news.
she wanted to do some research.
she talk to you?
a little bit.
she talk to Sally?
Sally tell you what they talk about?
no, she didn't.
can I go?
they did it together.
Len Lyle kills Sally...
and Nina gets John flowers to turn himself in.
why'd she turn him in?
why did Nina turn him in?
because you asked her to.
come on, Len.
why'd she turn him in?
it was the right thing to do.
you want me to sign one of these plays for you?
some girls love it.
we got surveillance cameras by the elevators back at the station.
we got tape of Nina in the lobby leaving after she turned him in.
she looked happy.
big smile.
like I said, she did the right thing.
send him back where he belongs.
well, you can't have killers roaming the streets all willy-nilly-like, now can you?
or Nina turned him in, and he goes down for a killing you did.
Anywho.
that picture you showed me. - The dead girl.
if I do it again, there won't be enough left for a photo like that.
you having a good time?
sure.
aren't you?
well, Len Lyle's alibi checks out.
he was in Oakland during the time of the killing.
you think Nina could have done that killing?
Nina seem like the kind of woman who'd kill to get those diamonds?
no, not the diamonds.
these surveillance photos we have of her leaving the station.
why was she smiling?
cause she got what she wanted.
except for the diamonds.
Nina wasn't looking for diamonds. She was looking for Sally.
looking for the letters that flowers sent Sally.
see what he promised her.
so nina comes in here, she's looking for the letters.
Sally catches her, it gets out of hand.
Nina wants John Flowers back.
only one way to make that happen.
she kills Sally.
and Flowers calls her for help.
he calls her again when he escapes.
and she brings him right to us.
her rehearsal alibi's soft.
theater's dark.
she could come and go, and no one would ever see her.
what did she do after that?
after Nina kills Sally?
she sneaks back to rehearsal.
no, what does she do after that?
why'd you turn John in?
cause it was the right thing to do?
put him back where he belongs?
Yes.
on the other end of those letters?
where he needs you?
Len Lyle hix doesn't need you, does he?
cause Len Lyle hix is a star.
and, flowers, he was with another woman.
the woman dies, and John goes back to prison.
then he needs you.
John killed that woman.
no, you did.
what did you do after?
how'd you deal with it?
taking a life?
all your life, writing to criminals, writing about criminals, just writing.
you killed that woman... - I did not.
she's there, and then she's not there.
her blood, it should be in her body, but it's not.
it's on you.
was not.
it's still on you, what happened.
what you did.
always on you.
you can feel it.
but how do you deal with it?
you write it down, don't you?
you have to write it down.
best thing you ever wrote?
let me read it now, Nina.
so where are the diamonds?
honey pot?
nice belly ring.
can I ask where you got that?
didn't I tell you never to wear them out in public? Didn't I?
well, what's the point of having them if I can't wear them? Right?
right.
right.
our recent guest, Len Lyle hix, finds himself back in prison for an apparently unprovoked attack on a Los Angeles police detective.
Los angeles police detective?
the altercation occurred at a performance of the play, three women, which is based on len lyle's crimes, time in prison, and until now, apparent rehabilitation.
here to talk about repeat offenders and can prisoners ever truly leave prison is noted psychiatrist...
agent Bodner?
this is Charlie Crews.
you still have that bullet I gave you?
hard to believe something so small could cause so much pain.
it only hurts when it's where it's not supposed to be.
and where's that bullet supposed to be next?
I could've killed you if I wanted to.
didn't hit anything vital.
same here.
so are we done shooting each other?
Yeah, I think so.
I need you to do something for me.
my partner. - Detective Reese.
she's on loan to you FBI guys.
some kind of organized crime task force?
and you want me to do what?
find out what kind some kind is.
why would you want to know that?
I think then I'll know where this is supposed to be.
I got it.
the coroner's transpo guy was making a delivery when he found him.
Jonah Grant. Assistant coroner.
lots of people get killed at work.
he just happened to work here.
blunt force trauma. Perfect circle wound.
some kind of hammer, maybe?
weird, though. Not a lot of blood.
there's something wrong with him.
Yeah, he's dead. - Something else.
he looks... Deader.
Deader? - More dead.
extra dead.
well...
he's got another wound here.
looks like, uh... - Where a shunt went in.
shunt? - Shunt.
a device used to introduce or extract fluids from a body.
and you are...
Tom Santos, assistant coroner.
I'm going to have to ask you to wait outside with one of the officers.
extract fluids? Like blood?
Yes, very good. Blood's a fluid.
it appears the wound to the head killed Jonah.
but he was rapidly exsanguinated directly thereafter.
exsanguinated. His blood was taken?
from the looks of him, I'd say Jonah was drained just about dry.
extra dead.
well, I guess we'll have to make two reports.
homicide, and... Robbery.
someone stole his blood.
why would someone take his blood?
do you know how they do it?
his heart would've stopped, so there'd be no pressure.
you'd need an external pump to get the pressure back up to exsanguinate him.
is the pump something you'd have in here?
Yeah, but it's usually broken.
I had to use a bike pump last week.
maybe you want to take a break.
we were shot-handed before, losing Grant means I'm down a coroner.
I have to do his work and my work.
and we're at a hiring freeze. The county won't let me hire a replacement.
do not touch. - Touch that.
candle wax?
maybe from someone's birthday cake.
you eat cake in here?
we're like any fice.
just because we deal with corpses doesn't mean we're not fun.
we are fun.
why was doctor Grant in the morgue?
I don't know; checking on bodies, finishing up paperwork.
anyone else have access to the crypt?
everybody. There's no lock on the crypts.
there's no locks on most doors.
what about surveillance cameras?
you can't have cameras in a coroner's office, except in designated rooms.
to protect the dead's privacy.
do you know how many people I've had to fire for taking cell phone shots?
did doctor Grant have any enemies?
he was a coroner's coroner.
he liked the dead more than the living.
he still went out in the fiel, even though he didn't have to.
where were you last night?
sleeping.
now you'll excuse me, I've been doing paperwork for two years.
I don't want to slip.
why would they take his blood?
quo kept working while we talked to her about Grant's death.
a lot of people use work as a painkiller.
me, I use painkillers for pain.
and you use work for work?
you're very certain, aren't you?
of what?
of everything.
no, just the things I'm certain of.
you sure about that?
they took his blood?
holy hannah.
it is ripe in here.
it's supposed to be 30 degrees, but with the doors opening and closing, it's 38.
stuff goes bad faster.
like meat in your fridge.
like meat.
that's all we are really.
Hey, how're we doing on that autopsy?
I'm lining up the ventura county coroner, but it's gonna take a few days.
we can't use any of the coroners from this office because they're all suspects.
how exactly does the nose smell things anyway?
you don't want to know.
Why?
you just don't.
no circular objects. Whatever the killer used isn't here.
people doing time.
court ordered community service. Dui's, unruly conduct, first-time arrests.
junior offenders.
maybe some one tepped up.
there's no eating in the lab.
I can still smell it out here.
that's just the particles lodged in your nose.
particles? Particles of what?
are they always here?
if we're here, they're here.
hoping to get a shot of some od'd rock star.
let's keep a lid on this.
anybody asks, Grant fell and hit his head.
every murder case we do goes through this office.
goth?
what?
your scene.
my scene?
is. - Is it goth? It is, isn't it?
I don't have a scene.
we all have a scene.
Yeah, what's yours?
it's complicated.
like a puzzle with a missing piece, you know?
no, I don't.
it's dark, right? Goth... It's dark?
Fiera Schwartz, arrested for drunk and disorderly outside a club called "bleak."
that a goth club?
Yeah, drunk and disorderly.
so now you think I killed that death doc.
I'm just asking questions.
where were you last night between 4: 00 and 6: 00 A.M?
that was the middle of the night, I was asleep.
where were you? Working on your puzzle?
you got a mouth on you.
Thanks.
guess I don't have to be drunk to be disorderly.
court ordered community service. - Next time I'm asking for jail.
eh, you're not having fun?
the coroners, the transpo guys hit on me all the time.
with dead people around, it's gross.
did doctor Grant ever hit on you?
no, he just yelled at me. What a jerk.
if you find the guy who killed him, thank him for me.
Hey, what were you drinking?
when you were drunk and disorderly.
bloody marys.
you will know when I know.
okay, that's all I can tell you.
you having a party?
Yes, we are.
and you're just in time for the pinata.
so why don't you go get a stick, and then hit me over the head with it.
you seem a little stressed.
maybe you wanna try this breathing exercise I know.
it's pretty easy.
detectives?
that's right.
with cases handled by the morgue.
two for two, detective Seever.
as of my last cup of coffee. - Which was my eighth cup of coffee
the chief instructed me to instruct every one of my detectives, that every one of their current and past cases may be thrown into doubt.
that's a legal term. It means "screwe."
maybe you want to sit down.
I am sitting down.
we took statements from all the employees.
alibis?
time of death was four in the morning...
most people were asleep.
those miscreants on the lawn?
no one with a serious record.
alibis?
still four in the morning.
grant dies, the cases they're working on get thrown out of court.
so what was Grant working on now?
you really know a breathing exercise?
Yeah. Just breathe.
said it was easy.
the case Grant was currently working on is Errol Brand.
celebrity chef. He's got those restaurants and that show.
brand new kitchen.
when do you have time to watch tv?
in the morning before work while I'm on the rowing machine.
in the morning?
actually, it's closer to four am, so I guess everyone isn't asleep.
you know, Brand also has one gun shot wound to the back of his head.
but no exit wound
small caliber.
how small?
it doesn't say. I'm not familiar with this case. It was doctor grant's.
may I?
she's a very fast reader.
entry wound, no exit wound, no bullet recovered.
no bullet?
someone shoots the chef, then digs the bullet out.
didn't work out? - No.
turns out I'm not FBI material.
well that's too bad, I know you wanted this to help you move up.
Yeah. Well, I got somewhere I belong.
so when you coming back?
in a few days.
there's just a few things I need to finish up.
there still room for me in your car?
right behind the wheel.
birthday cakes, condoms...
I guess they are fun.
crews gets close to your father, he disappears.
crews gets close to Rayborn, he disappears.
maybe it's just coincidence.
maybe they aren't connected.
everything's connected.
excuse me?
nothing.
well, maybe it's nothing, and then all this goes away.
crews trusts you?
then letim tell you the truth. You're doing the right thing.
what's that?
your job, detective Reese.
Errol Brand, celebrity chef, had that show, those restaurants, and a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
he also had something else...
an investor named Jimmy Ellison.
did Mr. Ellison invest in anything other than Errol Brand?
Mr. Ellison invests in gambling.
he was the biggest bookie in the county.
all that gambling money sure does buy a nice place.
we're looking for Jimmy Ellison.
Hector, who turned off my music?
I already talked to you cops about Errol.
I didn't do it.
you got no proof I did, you gotta leave me be.
we're not here about Errol Brand. We're here about Jonah Grant.
who the hell is that?
the coroner. - The coroner?
we're here about something else, too.
Yeah, what would that be? - Blood.
so why don't you show us what you got behind your back?
since chef died, mr. Jimmy just stays back there, inking his wine, listening to opera, cutting meat.
that's all he does?
sometimes. Sometimes he cries.
how you do, Jimmy?
you wanted to shoot me.
you cops just can't wait to shoot someone.
actually, 97% of all cops never use their gun.
except on the range.
you talk like a lawyer.
you'll have to cut that out if you wanna be mayor.
she wants to be mayor? - 15-year plan.
you'll just be going up for parole.
what's with the meat, Jimmy?
sitting back here getting drunk, cutting all this meat.
Errol died back here, right?
what's with all this meat, Jimmy?
Errol had a way of cutting meat.
so tender. Melt in your mouth.
never taste meat like that again
well if you miss it so much, you shouldn't have shot him.
Where's the bullet, Jimmy.
did you get the coroner to dig it out for you?
and then you killed the coroner.
I don't know what you're saying.
Where's the coroner's blood?
I don't know what you're saying.
Errol gets shot in the freezer, staggers back out into the kitchen, and dies right here.
Where's the bullet, Jimmy?
that is my cleaver.
this is my meat. This is my place!
take your cuffs and get out of here.
Hector, turn my music back on.
loud!
he was cutting meat?
and crying.
ellison gets that bullet back, he's gonna get rid of it.
but why take the coroner's blood?
he was cutting meat and crying.
anything interesting in there?
well, yeah, there is.
a tabloid shot, much closer to the ground.
there's something in here that's not in the police photos.
under his right hand, see?
a puddle of something on the floor.
blood?
no. Look at the police photos, there's no blood on his hand.
who took that picture?
this is mine. - How'd you get past the cops?
I got a pretty smile.
how'd you find the killing? Did you use a police scanner?
well, you can get those online, but I've always had this weird ability to know when people are gonna die.
Really? - Yeah.
ever since I was a little girl.
am I gonna die? I mean soon?
what's the possible upside of asking a question like that?
you really want to know?
Yeah, yeah. I really want to know.
no...
not you. Not soon.
but somebody very close to you is gonna die. Soon.
your photo of the dead chef. - We need to see the digital file it came from.
why so close to the ground?
that's where we all end up when we're dead.
so I like to get right down in there.
can you enlarge this section?
you were at the morgue yesterday.
I'm at the morgue a lot.
you didn't happento know that doctor Grant was gonna die?
no. But those morgue boys are so covered in death, it's hard to tell.
is it true someone took his blood?
there. Slide that over.
it's a clear liquid. What is that?
they swabbed the chef's hand, nothing.
no substance on it at all.
so it's a clear liquid...
that leaves no trace, that we like to call...
water.
it evaporated by the time they got to the morgue, so it would not have been noticed.
so he got shot in there, stumbled out, and scoop a handful of water?
he reaches down for this.
someone comes up behind him... Shoots him in the head.
what?
hand me that melon, would you?
he reaches dcwn, stands up, and...
the chef stumbles out.
he reaches back, pulls it out...
falls, dies, icicle's melt by the time anyone gets there, puts the puddle under his hand.
and no bullet in his head.
so who took the coroner's blood?
I want to thank you for coming back.
I was wrong. What I did last time.
uh, ask me anything you want, any way you want.
let me just ask you one question, though.
your eyes are very red.
you're not on drugs.
I'mnot prying, this is a legal matter. I'm on parole.
no, I am not on drugs.
now what do you remember about your parents?
why are your eyes so red?
has she been... crying?
you know, I saw a lot of crying in prison, Anna. A lot.
I know what it looks like. You have been crying.
no, I have not been crying. - I think you have.
I'm just tired. - Those are not tired eyes.
they are, the baby keeps me up.
the baby?
your baby?
I'm a grandfather?
doesn't your husband help you?
about what Kathy White said about someone close to me, it didn't have to be you.
there are a lot of people close to me.
you just, you know, happened to be standing close to me...
at the time.
there actually aren't a lot of people close to me.
I guess there should be more.
I've been away.
complaints, filed against jonah grant. 27 of them.
complaints filed by...
grant's been dead for two days and you just discover I filed all those complaints against him.
geniuses.
well, maybe now you can tell us why you hated doctor Grant.
he wasn't my dream slab mate.
slab mate?
we used to have our own labs, now we have to double up.
budget cuts?
Yeah, like you know. Cops get everything.
helicopters, guns.
we have to buy our own toilet paper.
cheap, scratchy.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, tell my ass you're sorry, ma'am.
Oh, that must've been Grant's. Typical.
is this what you complained about?
no. I complained about Grant's practical jokes.
practical jokes?
Yeah, brilliant stuff.
fingers in my coffee mug, cranial cap saucer, hiding my pen down an esophagus.
I filed numerous complaints against him for creating a hostile workplace.
doctor Quo did nothing.
why not?
grant did all her work for her. They were "buds."
they're all "buds" around here.
confederacy of dunces.
doctor Quo knew that you and Grant didn't get along?
Oh, yes. She said I was the one being unreasonable.
well, you see how that worked out.
she ignored the problem, and Grant got himself murdered in the office.
chickens coming home to roost.
you seem almost happy about that.
I won't pretend to mourn doctor Grant.
you know, he used to kick me out of the lab?
he said I "harshed his buzz."
and you went?
I had to. He had seniority.
your statement said that you were home when Grant was killed.
it was 4: 00 A.M.
where were you?
which equipment is yours, and which was doct Grant's?
my equipment is the newer-looking, well-maintained, clean equipment, engraved with a small "s."
doctor Grant's is everything else.
could any of these tools leave a perfect circle wound?
that would be a bone mallet.
do you have a bone mallet?
I do, it's usuallhere.
but Grant was always moving my things.
so you don't have a bone mallet.
no. I have one.
I just don't know where it is.
circular head.
and engraved with a small "s."
recognize this?
it's mine.
why does lapd always ask questions they know the answers to?
why do you think we do it?
because you're stupid and lazy.
you take something obvious, and then you flail around until a D. A.Pays attention.
the coroner's office does a perfectly acceptable job.
if there's a way to blow a case, the lapd will find it.
we found your prints on this mallet.
well, you would. It's my mallet.
and Grant's skin and blood.
which I forgot to wash off.
I assure you, had I killed him, I would've made time.
I'm very good at prioritizing.
you complained. Nothing was done.
that made me angry. Not stupid.
angry people don't think clearly.
they grab the first thing they can and smash it into someone's skull.
I'm quite aware of that.
I've overseen a few murder cases including, by the way, many that your squad handled.
how clearly are you thinking?
are you threatenings?
I don't know. Am I?
convict me, and I will personally put 200 guilty killers back on the street.
and why on earth would I take that man's blood?
do you even know what five quarts of blood looks like?
ten pints.
five quarts.
fruit punch.
don't think there's any fruit in it, though.
are you gonna drink that?
I wanted to see what it looked like.
am I supposed to understand that?
no. I mean yes, but...no.
what did you find out about Reese?
about the organized crime task force?
there isn't any.
there's no current cooperation between the FBI and lapd at all.
I've seen surveillance video of reese, going in and out of the buiding, so I know she's there.
but there's no records she's there on official business.
officially, Reese isn't there at all.
you gonna drink those here, honey, or should I get them to go?
all it is is stupid office politics.
I didn't think it mattered.
I need Santos. I have bodies piling up.
I didn't even have time for lunch.
he accused you of incompetence.
Santos thinks everyone's incompetent.
I'm making too much money. I'm trying to screw him.
did you ever work in an office?
do you think Santos killed Grant?
mm, I haven't had much time to think about it.
why don't you take the time and think about it now?
please.
if this job teaches you anything, anyone's capable of murder.
I find that kind of sad.
with Grant dead...
Santos is senior coroner with a pay bump.
I guess that's motive, huh?
you have some new equipment here.
it must be expensive, this stuff.
I'm sure it is.
purchasing the equipment was doctor Grant's job.
but there's audget crisis.
so if you've got no money coming in, how'd you buy this equipment?
as I said, it was doctor Grant's job.
we need to see his records.
it's a lot. - Five quarts.
ten pints, 160 ounces.
you can't drink it all at once.
I mean, not in blood.
in fruit punch.
it's a lot.
there is no record in here of any money coming in or the purchase of new equipment.
but there is no equipment out there, so how did Grant pay for it?
we'll be seeing you.
how will they be seeing us?
should I leave the room?
no, no, come over here.
will I be laying down too?
no.
pretend I'm dead.
should I pretend to be sad?
no. Pretend I'm dead.
pretend you're a coroner.
what do you do?
does your phone have a camera now?
Yeah, five megapixels.
is that a lot?
it's mega. So yes, it is.
hold on.
that's where we all end up when wdie.
so she likes to get down there.
that's what Kathy White said.
Oh, god! I'm...
sorry .- I'm. - I'll come back.
they're all low angle and close to the ground.
like the position a coroner would be in when examining a body.
maybe Kathy White didn't need to be on the scene to get these.
maybe she wasn't the one taking these pictures.
maybe she was buying them.
we can check your financials.
my what?
your bank account, credit cards...
you can just do that?
we can just do that.
we're the police.
she's a lawyer, too.
is it gonna show payments from you for those photos?
because looking at these photos of yours up here on these walls, they're really stunning.
but the photos in the paper, not your best work.
not your work at all, right?
look, you don't need to check my financials, okay?
I paid Grant to take those pictures.
it's competitive out there.
he needed the money, and I needed the pictures.
where were you when he was killed?
it was four in the morning, I was
asleep?
why would I kill him?
he needed the money, and I needed the pictures.
just. - Just out of curiosity, what would I be worth dead?
six figures.
six figures?
but not anytime soon?
no, not anytime soon.
so, he left you?
for a dog walker.
Ann, what's a dog walker?
she walks dogs.
she walks dogs.
for a living?
and he doesn't help with the baby?
he doesn't want to see the baby.
he doesn't want to see the baby?
he doesn't want to see me.
he doesn't want to see you?
Ann, what's the baby's name?
you can go home when you solve it.
I am not reopening those cases.
can I ask you something?
is it about prison?
fruit?
Zen?
no, it's about Tidwell.
is it true he's dating your partner?
well, that would be against regs.
Yeah, it would be.
you know what else is against regs?
vodka in the lab.
and condoms in the stairwell.
that lab needs money.
what else were they selling?
you know what that adds up to?
I have a pretty good idea.
Candles+vodka+condoms.
party in a morgue?
I guess your scene is pretty dark after all.
are you Shane Banks? - Jesus!
you scared the hell out of me.
I think you might be in the wrong truck, pops.
first of all, it's grandpops.
and you know who I am?
I'm the grandpops you didn't want to meet.
my scene is just money.
they all paid a lot to be in here; $250 each.
to dance with the dead?
it makes them feel more alive.
them? Not you, Fiera?
you're just about the money.
grant ever catch you doing this?
grant catch me? Grant knew.
you give Grant a cut?
that's a big cut.
he knew he had me.
this is the only place in town where you cn dance with the dead.
who else knew?
they all knew?
are there any rules anymore?
no smoking.
that was the rule. - No smoking.
that woman, Quo, was real strict about it.
you know, didn't want a fire, I guess.
but candles were okay?
Yeah, they were.
Debbie quo, always eating.
Debbie quo doesn't allow smoking.
Penatal vitamins charged on youcredit card.
how far along?
four months.
the father, it's Grant?
Debbie, don't you think this is something you should've told us about?
I wanted, I just couldn't.
why couldn't you?
I'd lose my health insurance.
if it got out in the office that I'd had an affair, they'd fire me, it'd go on my record...
no one would hire me in the system.
I need my insurance.
we need my insurance.
Jonah would want me to have it now.
Debbie, you told us he liked the dead more than the living.
until he met me.
he loved death until he met me.
I guess he was just in bad relationships.
until he met you.
the firstime Jonah and I kissed, he said...
lips are just a valve, but yours are sweet.
Jonah thought my valve was sweet.
you took money for those parties.
to pay for equipment.
and from the photographer.
you ever think about opening up a gift shop?
we have a gift shop。- We never took any money from the photographer.
Kathy was paying for photos that Grant took for her.
we never took any money from a photographer.
what was grant doing with the money that photographer gave him?
according to Quo, he wasn't sharing it.
but there's nothing in grant's financials that show him getting any kind of moy at all.
and there was no cash found when his house and car were searched, so.
maybe we're looking at the wrong financials.
maybe we should be looking at the photographer's financials.
you mean the ones she told us not to bother looking at?
just a valve.
lips.
he said hers were sweet.
Kathyhite's financials.
nothing. There's no evidence here that kathy white gave any money to grant at all.
so if she wasn't paying him...
why was he taking those photos?
there's something else.
Kathy white has two aptments in that building.
one that we talked to her in, 314, and another one. 319
must be right down the hall.
got the pass key from the manager.
did he say why she has two apartments?
said she used it for storage.
shunts.
a device used to introduce or extract fluids from the body.
five quarts.
quo said Grant was in bad relationships.
I guess this is one of them.
he loved death until he met Quo.
Kathy white loves death, too.
I thought you could make life.
you can't make life.
you can't.
you can't make life.
grant didn't want to have a baby with you?
he didn't want to be th anyone until he met her.
but he still took that chef picture for you, kathy. Didn't he?
he said it was his last.
he said we were over.
he said he was making a life with that other woman.
so I took him.
all five quarts.
detective...
take a picture.
she was right next to me.
what she said about someone close to me was gonna die, she was standing right next to me.
I was in that 97%.
I never fired my gun, except on the range.
objects are not deceiving.
they are deception.
what we see...
what we hear...
all that our senses present to us is a fiction.
no more real...
than a dream.
you can only know...
that which we believe.
that which we believe.
that is all we have.
you ready?
you ready?
Yeah.
but not for this.
uh, I don't understand.
I go back to my partner.
I go back working for the lapd.
not for you.
I thought you wanted the truth.
I know that.
I understand.
good for you.
you know...
there is an operation we're running right now down in Sandiego. - Border stuff.
you want in?
Yeah. Okay, yeah.
they'll take you down to the Sandiego field office, get you set up.
you boys out of Sandiego?
hard to believe something so small could cause so much pain.
it only hurts when it's where it's not supposed to be.
and where's that bullet supposed to be next?
I could've killed you if I wanted to.
didn't hit anything vital.
same here.
so are we done shooting each other?
Yeah, I think so.
I need you to do something for me.
my partner. - Detective Reese.
she's on loan to you FBI guys.
some kind of organized crime task force?
and you want me to do what?
find out what kind some kind is.
why would you want to know that?
I think then I'll know where this is supposed to be.
I got it.
the coroner's transpo guy was making a delivery when he found him.
Jonah Grant. Assistant coroner.
lots of people get killed at work.
he just happened to work here.
blunt force trauma. Perfect circle wound.
some kind of hammer, maybe?
weird, though. Not a lot of blood.
there's something wrong with him.
Yeah, he's dead. - Something else.
he looks... Deader.
Deader? - More dead.
extra dead.
well...
he's got another wound here.
looks like, uh... - Where a shunt went in.
shunt? - Shunt.
a device used to introduce or extract fluids from a body.
and you are...
Tom Santos, assistant coroner.
I'm going to have to ask you to wait outside with one of the officers.
extract fluids? Like blood?
Yes, very good. Blood's a fluid.
it appears the wound to the head killed Jonah.
but he was rapidly exsanguinated directly thereafter.
exsanguinated. His blood was taken?
from the looks of him, I'd say Jonah was drained just about dry.
extra dead.
well, I guess we'll have to make two reports.
homicide, and... Robbery.
someone stole his blood.
why would someone take his blood?
do you know how they do it?
his heart would've stopped, so there'd be no pressure.
you'd need an external pump to get the pressure back up to exsanguinate him.
is the pump something you'd have in here?
Yeah, but it's usually broken.
I had to use a bike pump last week.
maybe you want to take a break.
we were shot-handed before, losing Grant means I'm down a coroner.
I have to do his work and my work.
and we're at a hiring freeze. The county won't let me hire a replacement.
do not touch. - Touch that.
candle wax?
maybe from someone's birthday cake.
you eat cake in here?
we're like any fice.
just because we deal with corpses doesn't mean we're not fun.
we are fun.
why was doctor Grant in the morgue?
I don't know; checking on bodies, finishing up paperwork.
anyone else have access to the crypt?
everybody. There's no lock on the crypts.
there's no locks on most doors.
what about surveillance cameras?
you can't have cameras in a coroner's office, except in designated rooms.
to protect the dead's privacy.
do you know how many people I've had to fire for taking cell phone shots?
did doctor Grant have any enemies?
he was a coroner's coroner.
he liked the dead more than the living.
he still went out in the fiel, even though he didn't have to.
where were you last night?
sleeping.
now you'll excuse me, I've been doing paperwork for two years.
I don't want to slip.
why would they take his blood?
quo kept working while we talked to her about Grant's death.
a lot of people use work as a painkiller.
me, I use painkillers for pain.
and you use work for work?
you're very certain, aren't you?
of what?
of everything.
no, just the things I'm certain of.
you sure about that?
they took his blood?
holy hannah.
it is ripe in here.
it's supposed to be 30 degrees, but with the doors opening and closing, it's 38.
stuff goes bad faster.
like meat in your fridge.
like meat.
that's all we are really.
Hey, how're we doing on that autopsy?
I'm lining up the ventura county coroner, but it's gonna take a few days.
we can't use any of the coroners from this office because they're all suspects.
how exactly does the nose smell things anyway?
you don't want to know.
Why?
you just don't.
no circular objects. Whatever the killer used isn't here.
people doing time.
court ordered community service. Dui's, unruly conduct, first-time arrests.
junior offenders.
maybe some one tepped up.
there's no eating in the lab.
I can still smell it out here.
that's just the particles lodged in your nose.
particles? Particles of what?
are they always here?
if we're here, they're here.
hoping to get a shot of some od'd rock star.
let's keep a lid on this.
anybody asks, Grant fell and hit his head.
every murder case we do goes through this office.
goth?
what?
your scene.
my scene?
is. - Is it goth? It is, isn't it?
I don't have a scene.
we all have a scene.
Yeah, what's yours?
it's complicated.
like a puzzle with a missing piece, you know?
no, I don't.
it's dark, right? Goth... It's dark?
Fiera Schwartz, arrested for drunk and disorderly outside a club called "bleak."
that a goth club?
Yeah, drunk and disorderly.
so now you think I killed that death doc.
I'm just asking questions.
where were you last night between 4: 00 and 6: 00 A.M?
that was the middle of the night, I was asleep.
where were you? Working on your puzzle?
you got a mouth on you.
Thanks.
guess I don't have to be drunk to be disorderly.
court ordered community service. - Next time I'm asking for jail.
eh, you're not having fun?
the coroners, the transpo guys hit on me all the time.
with dead people around, it's gross.
did doctor Grant ever hit on you?
no, he just yelled at me. What a jerk.
if you find the guy who killed him, thank him for me.
Hey, what were you drinking?
when you were drunk and disorderly.
bloody marys.
you will know when I know.
okay, that's all I can tell you.
you having a party?
Yes, we are.
and you're just in time for the pinata.
so why don't you go get a stick, and then hit me over the head with it.
you seem a little stressed.
maybe you wanna try this breathing exercise I know.
it's pretty easy.
detectives?
that's right.
with cases handled by the morgue.
two for two, detective Seever.
as of my last cup of coffee. - Which was my eighth cup of coffee
the chief instructed me to instruct every one of my detectives, that every one of their current and past cases may be thrown into doubt.
that's a legal term. It means "screwe."
maybe you want to sit down.
I am sitting down.
we took statements from all the employees.
alibis?
time of death was four in the morning...
most people were asleep.
those miscreants on the lawn?
no one with a serious record.
alibis?
still four in the morning.
grant dies, the cases they're working on get thrown out of court.
so what was Grant working on now?
you really know a breathing exercise?
Yeah. Just breathe.
said it was easy.
the case Grant was currently working on is Errol Brand.
celebrity chef. He's got those restaurants and that show.
brand new kitchen.
when do you have time to watch tv?
in the morning before work while I'm on the rowing machine.
in the morning?
actually, it's closer to four am, so I guess everyone isn't asleep.
you know, Brand also has one gun shot wound to the back of his head.
but no exit wound
small caliber.
how small?
it doesn't say. I'm not familiar with this case. It was doctor grant's.
may I?
she's a very fast reader.
entry wound, no exit wound, no bullet recovered.
no bullet?
someone shoots the chef, then digs the bullet out.
didn't work out? - No.
turns out I'm not FBI material.
well that's too bad, I know you wanted this to help you move up.
Yeah. Well, I got somewhere I belong.
so when you coming back?
in a few days.
there's just a few things I need to finish up.
there still room for me in your car?
right behind the wheel.
birthday cakes, condoms...
I guess they are fun.
crews gets close to your father, he disappears.
crews gets close to Rayborn, he disappears.
maybe it's just coincidence.
maybe they aren't connected.
everything's connected.
excuse me?
nothing.
well, maybe it's nothing, and then all this goes away.
crews trusts you?
then letim tell you the truth. You're doing the right thing.
what's that?
your job, detective Reese.
Errol Brand, celebrity chef, had that show, those restaurants, and a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
he also had something else...
an investor named Jimmy Ellison.
did Mr. Ellison invest in anything other than Errol Brand?
Mr. Ellison invests in gambling.
he was the biggest bookie in the county.
all that gambling money sure does buy a nice place.
we're looking for Jimmy Ellison.
Hector, who turned off my music?
I already talked to you cops about Errol.
I didn't do it.
you got no proof I did, you gotta leave me be.
we're not here about Errol Brand. We're here about Jonah Grant.
who the hell is that?
the coroner. - The coroner?
we're here about something else, too.
Yeah, what would that be? - Blood.
so why don't you show us what you got behind your back?
since chef died, mr. Jimmy just stays back there, inking his wine, listening to opera, cutting meat.
that's all he does?
sometimes. Sometimes he cries.
how you do, Jimmy?
you wanted to shoot me.
you cops just can't wait to shoot someone.
actually, 97% of all cops never use their gun.
except on the range.
you talk like a lawyer.
you'll have to cut that out if you wanna be mayor.
she wants to be mayor? - 15-year plan.
you'll just be going up for parole.
what's with the meat, Jimmy?
sitting back here getting drunk, cutting all this meat.
Errol died back here, right?
what's with all this meat, Jimmy?
Errol had a way of cutting meat.
so tender. Melt in your mouth.
never taste meat like that again
well if you miss it so much, you shouldn't have shot him.
Where's the bullet, Jimmy.
did you get the coroner to dig it out for you?
and then you killed the coroner.
I don't know what you're saying.
Where's the coroner's blood?
I don't know what you're saying.
Errol gets shot in the freezer, staggers back out into the kitchen, and dies right here.
Where's the bullet, Jimmy?
that is my cleaver.
this is my meat. This is my place!
take your cuffs and get out of here.
Hector, turn my music back on.
loud!
he was cutting meat?
and crying.
ellison gets that bullet back, he's gonna get rid of it.
but why take the coroner's blood?
he was cutting meat and crying.
anything interesting in there?
well, yeah, there is.
a tabloid shot, much closer to the ground.
there's something in here that's not in the police photos.
under his right hand, see?
a puddle of something on the floor.
blood?
no. Look at the police photos, there's no blood on his hand.
who took that picture?
this is mine. - How'd you get past the cops?
I got a pretty smile.
how'd you find the killing? Did you use a police scanner?
well, you can get those online, but I've always had this weird ability to know when people are gonna die.
Really? - Yeah.
ever since I was a little girl.
am I gonna die? I mean soon?
what's the possible upside of asking a question like that?
you really want to know?
Yeah, yeah. I really want to know.
no...
not you. Not soon.
but somebody very close to you is gonna die. Soon.
your photo of the dead chef. - We need to see the digital file it came from.
why so close to the ground?
that's where we all end up when we're dead.
so I like to get right down in there.
can you enlarge this section?
you were at the morgue yesterday.
I'm at the morgue a lot.
you didn't happento know that doctor Grant was gonna die?
no. But those morgue boys are so covered in death, it's hard to tell.
is it true someone took his blood?
there. Slide that over.
it's a clear liquid. What is that?
they swabbed the chef's hand, nothing.
no substance on it at all.
so it's a clear liquid...
that leaves no trace, that we like to call...
water.
it evaporated by the time they got to the morgue, so it would not have been noticed.
so he got shot in there, stumbled out, and scoop a handful of water?
he reaches down for this.
someone comes up behind him... Shoots him in the head.
what?
hand me that melon, would you?
he reaches dcwn, stands up, and...
the chef stumbles out.
he reaches back, pulls it out...
falls, dies, icicle's melt by the time anyone gets there, puts the puddle under his hand.
and no bullet in his head.
so who took the coroner's blood?
I want to thank you for coming back.
I was wrong. What I did last time.
uh, ask me anything you want, any way you want.
let me just ask you one question, though.
your eyes are very red.
you're not on drugs.
I'mnot prying, this is a legal matter. I'm on parole.
no, I am not on drugs.
now what do you remember about your parents?
why are your eyes so red?
has she been... crying?
you know, I saw a lot of crying in prison, Anna. A lot.
I know what it looks like. You have been crying.
no, I have not been crying. - I think you have.
I'm just tired. - Those are not tired eyes.
they are, the baby keeps me up.
the baby?
your baby?
I'm a grandfather?
doesn't your husband help you?
about what Kathy White said about someone close to me, it didn't have to be you.
there are a lot of people close to me.
you just, you know, happened to be standing close to me...
at the time.
there actually aren't a lot of people close to me.
I guess there should be more.
I've been away.
complaints, filed against jonah grant. 27 of them.
complaints filed by...
grant's been dead for two days and you just discover I filed all those complaints against him.
geniuses.
well, maybe now you can tell us why you hated doctor Grant.
he wasn't my dream slab mate.
slab mate?
we used to have our own labs, now we have to double up.
budget cuts?
Yeah, like you know. Cops get everything.
helicopters, guns.
we have to buy our own toilet paper.
cheap, scratchy.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, tell my ass you're sorry, ma'am.
Oh, that must've been Grant's. Typical.
is this what you complained about?
no. I complained about Grant's practical jokes.
practical jokes?
Yeah, brilliant stuff.
fingers in my coffee mug, cranial cap saucer, hiding my pen down an esophagus.
I filed numerous complaints against him for creating a hostile workplace.
doctor Quo did nothing.
why not?
grant did all her work for her. They were "buds."
they're all "buds" around here.
confederacy of dunces.
doctor Quo knew that you and Grant didn't get along?
Oh, yes. She said I was the one being unreasonable.
well, you see how that worked out.
she ignored the problem, and Grant got himself murdered in the office.
chickens coming home to roost.
you seem almost happy about that.
I won't pretend to mourn doctor Grant.
you know, he used to kick me out of the lab?
he said I "harshed his buzz."
and you went?
I had to. He had seniority.
your statement said that you were home when Grant was killed.
it was 4: 00 A.M.
where were you?
which equipment is yours, and which was doct Grant's?
my equipment is the newer-looking, well-maintained, clean equipment, engraved with a small "s."
doctor Grant's is everything else.
could any of these tools leave a perfect circle wound?
that would be a bone mallet.
do you have a bone mallet?
I do, it's usuallhere.
but Grant was always moving my things.
so you don't have a bone mallet.
no. I have one.
I just don't know where it is.
circular head.
and engraved with a small "s."
recognize this?
it's mine.
why does lapd always ask questions they know the answers to?
why do you think we do it?
because you're stupid and lazy.
you take something obvious, and then you flail around until a D. A.Pays attention.
the coroner's office does a perfectly acceptable job.
if there's a way to blow a case, the lapd will find it.
we found your prints on this mallet.
well, you would. It's my mallet.
and Grant's skin and blood.
which I forgot to wash off.
I assure you, had I killed him, I would've made time.
I'm very good at prioritizing.
you complained. Nothing was done.
that made me angry. Not stupid.
angry people don't think clearly.
they grab the first thing they can and smash it into someone's skull.
I'm quite aware of that.
I've overseen a few murder cases including, by the way, many that your squad handled.
how clearly are you thinking?
are you threatenings?
I don't know. Am I?
convict me, and I will personally put 200 guilty killers back on the street.
and why on earth would I take that man's blood?
do you even know what five quarts of blood looks like?
ten pints.
five quarts.
fruit punch.
don't think there's any fruit in it, though.
are you gonna drink that?
I wanted to see what it looked like.
am I supposed to understand that?
no. I mean yes, but...no.
what did you find out about Reese?
about the organized crime task force?
there isn't any.
there's no current cooperation between the FBI and lapd at all.
I've seen surveillance video of reese, going in and out of the buiding, so I know she's there.
but there's no records she's there on official business.
officially, Reese isn't there at all.
you gonna drink those here, honey, or should I get them to go?
all it is is stupid office politics.
I didn't think it mattered.
I need Santos. I have bodies piling up.
I didn't even have time for lunch.
he accused you of incompetence.
Santos thinks everyone's incompetent.
I'm making too much money. I'm trying to screw him.
did you ever work in an office?
do you think Santos killed Grant?
mm, I haven't had much time to think about it.
why don't you take the time and think about it now?
please.
if this job teaches you anything, anyone's capable of murder.
I find that kind of sad.
with Grant dead...
Santos is senior coroner with a pay bump.
I guess that's motive, huh?
you have some new equipment here.
it must be expensive, this stuff.
I'm sure it is.
purchasing the equipment was doctor Grant's job.
but there's audget crisis.
so if you've got no money coming in, how'd you buy this equipment?
as I said, it was doctor Grant's job.
we need to see his records.
it's a lot. - Five quarts.
ten pints, 160 ounces.
you can't drink it all at once.
I mean, not in blood.
in fruit punch.
it's a lot.
there is no record in here of any money coming in or the purchase of new equipment.
but there is no equipment out there, so how did Grant pay for it?
we'll be seeing you.
how will they be seeing us?
should I leave the room?
no, no, come over here.
will I be laying down too?
no.
pretend I'm dead.
should I pretend to be sad?
no. Pretend I'm dead.
pretend you're a coroner.
what do you do?
does your phone have a camera now?
Yeah, five megapixels.
is that a lot?
it's mega. So yes, it is.
hold on.
that's where we all end up when wdie.
so she likes to get down there.
that's what Kathy White said.
Oh, god! I'm...
sorry .- I'm. - I'll come back.
they're all low angle and close to the ground.
like the position a coroner would be in when examining a body.
maybe Kathy White didn't need to be on the scene to get these.
maybe she wasn't the one taking these pictures.
maybe she was buying them.
we can check your financials.
my what?
your bank account, credit cards...
you can just do that?
we can just do that.
we're the police.
she's a lawyer, too.
is it gonna show payments from you for those photos?
because looking at these photos of yours up here on these walls, they're really stunning.
but the photos in the paper, not your best work.
not your work at all, right?
look, you don't need to check my financials, okay?
I paid Grant to take those pictures.
it's competitive out there.
he needed the money, and I needed the pictures.
where were you when he was killed?
it was four in the morning, I was
asleep?
why would I kill him?
he needed the money, and I needed the pictures.
just. - Just out of curiosity, what would I be worth dead?
six figures.
six figures?
but not anytime soon?
no, not anytime soon.
so, he left you?
for a dog walker.
Ann, what's a dog walker?
she walks dogs.
she walks dogs.
for a living?
and he doesn't help with the baby?
he doesn't want to see the baby.
he doesn't want to see the baby?
he doesn't want to see me.
he doesn't want to see you?
Ann, what's the baby's name?
you can go home when you solve it.
I am not reopening those cases.
can I ask you something?
is it about prison?
fruit?
Zen?
no, it's about Tidwell.
is it true he's dating your partner?
well, that would be against regs.
Yeah, it would be.
you know what else is against regs?
vodka in the lab.
and condoms in the stairwell.
that lab needs money.
what else were they selling?
you know what that adds up to?
I have a pretty good idea.
Candles+vodka+condoms.
party in a morgue?
I guess your scene is pretty dark after all.
are you Shane Banks? - Jesus!
you scared the hell out of me.
I think you might be in the wrong truck, pops.
first of all, it's grandpops.
and you know who I am?
I'm the grandpops you didn't want to meet.
my scene is just money.
they all paid a lot to be in here; $250 each.
to dance with the dead?
it makes them feel more alive.
them? Not you, Fiera?
you're just about the money.
grant ever catch you doing this?
grant catch me? Grant knew.
you give Grant a cut?
that's a big cut.
he knew he had me.
this is the only place in town where you cn dance with the dead.
who else knew?
they all knew?
are there any rules anymore?
no smoking.
that was the rule. - No smoking.
that woman, Quo, was real strict about it.
you know, didn't want a fire, I guess.
but candles were okay?
Yeah, they were.
Debbie quo, always eating.
Debbie quo doesn't allow smoking.
Penatal vitamins charged on youcredit card.
how far along?
four months.
the father, it's Grant?
Debbie, don't you think this is something you should've told us about?
I wanted, I just couldn't.
why couldn't you?
I'd lose my health insurance.
if it got out in the office that I'd had an affair, they'd fire me, it'd go on my record...
no one would hire me in the system.
I need my insurance.
we need my insurance.
Jonah would want me to have it now.
Debbie, you told us he liked the dead more than the living.
until he met me.
he loved death until he met me.
I guess he was just in bad relationships.
until he met you.
the firstime Jonah and I kissed, he said...
lips are just a valve, but yours are sweet.
Jonah thought my valve was sweet.
you took money for those parties.
to pay for equipment.
and from the photographer.
you ever think about opening up a gift shop?
we have a gift shop。- We never took any money from the photographer.
Kathy was paying for photos that Grant took for her.
we never took any money from a photographer.
what was grant doing with the money that photographer gave him?
according to Quo, he wasn't sharing it.
but there's nothing in grant's financials that show him getting any kind of moy at all.
and there was no cash found when his house and car were searched, so.
maybe we're looking at the wrong financials.
maybe we should be looking at the photographer's financials.
you mean the ones she told us not to bother looking at?
just a valve.
lips.
he said hers were sweet.
Kathyhite's financials.
nothing. There's no evidence here that kathy white gave any money to grant at all.
so if she wasn't paying him...
why was he taking those photos?
there's something else.
Kathy white has two aptments in that building.
one that we talked to her in, 314, and another one. 319
must be right down the hall.
got the pass key from the manager.
did he say why she has two apartments?
said she used it for storage.
shunts.
a device used to introduce or extract fluids from the body.
five quarts.
quo said Grant was in bad relationships.
I guess this is one of them.
he loved death until he met Quo.
Kathy white loves death, too.
I thought you could make life.
you can't make life.
you can't.
you can't make life.
grant didn't want to have a baby with you?
he didn't want to be th anyone until he met her.
but he still took that chef picture for you, kathy. Didn't he?
he said it was his last.
he said we were over.
he said he was making a life with that other woman.
so I took him.
all five quarts.
detective...
take a picture.
she was right next to me.
what she said about someone close to me was gonna die, she was standing right next to me.
I was in that 97%.
I never fired my gun, except on the range.
objects are not deceiving.
they are deception.
what we see...
what we hear...
all that our senses present to us is a fiction.
no more real...
than a dream.
you can only know...
that which we believe.
that which we believe.
that is all we have.
you ready?
you ready?
Yeah.
but not for this.
uh, I don't understand.
I go back to my partner.
I go back working for the lapd.
not for you.
I thought you wanted the truth.
I know that.
I understand.
good for you.
you know...
there is an operation we're running right now down in Sandiego. - Border stuff.
you want in?
Yeah. Okay, yeah.
they'll take you down to the Sandiego field office, get you set up.
you boys out of Sandiego?
your name is roman nevikov?
my name is roman nevikov.
aren't you supposed to be in prison?
no man is supposed to be in prison.
okay.
but the federal authorities believe that you're in prison.
Yes, they believe that.
so how can you be here?
a man I know has kindly offered to serve my time for me.
that was very nice of him.
people like to do favors for me.
always have. I don't know why.
maybe it's because you'll kill their families if they don't.
Yes, maybe.
can we talk about charlie crews?
isn't that why you are here?
if you could say one thing to charlie crews, what would it be?
one thing? Anything?
Yes, anything.
okay. Okay.
this is what I would like to say to charlie crews.
my friend.
beautiful.
would you like to say hi?
Oh, we'd better change this tape.
if anyone's seen where we are, yes?
okay. Go ahead. Say it.
play it again from the beginning.
okay. Go ahead. Say it.
crews, he says he wants rayborn.
he says you bring rayborn to him...
you bring rayborn to him and I can go. Crews
but rayborn is dead.
I know that.
so why does roman nevikov think mickey rayborn is alive?
maybe he knows something we don't.
well, you got about five minutes to figure out what that is.
the brass saw that tape. Now they're coming down here to see you.
and I could care less what they do with you,
but you will tell me why nevikov thinks rayborn is still alive
and you will tell me what I need to know to get reese back.
you want her back?
well, i should go before the brass gets here.
okay, where's your first stop?
our friends at the f. b.i.
no, last time we asked them questions they stonewalled us.
last time I asked them questions like a cop.
this time it'll be a little different.
I should, uh, maybe leave this. - No, no. Keep it. It'll help.
but leave your phone. They'll track you on it.
here. Take mine. They won't look for it.
detective crews. You go get her.
got nothing else to do today.
Where's detective crews?
you see where crewsent?
find him.
what we learned as children, that one plus one equals two, we know to be false.
one plus one equals one.
we even have a word for when you plus another equals one.
that word is
I need to see rayborn's body.
and you think that crews is gonna give you what you want?
he'll find you, but he won't give you what you want.
he'll give you something else.
and what is that?
I think you know what that is.
you're connected to me.
I'm connected to crews.
he'll find you. - Connected.
that was our friend.
he says crews is probably headed back this way.
and he wants you to pick up his shirts.
you do that for him? - Yeah.
hello.
detective crews. It's seever. Do not go to the f. b.i. There was a shooting.
the people you're going to see are no longer there.
there's three dead.
you have the names of the f. b.i. Dead?
Yeah.
any of them bodner? - No.
they catch the shooter? - No.
not my phone. Not my numbers.
Tidwell's phone. Tidwell's numbers.
but I can...
I can get the number that just dialed me. I can do that, right?
this is jane seever. Leave a message.
Seever, go to my phone. I need bodner's number. Call me with it.
Roman send you?
Yeah.
I'm done.
I'm done, aren't i?
Charlie, i got that number. I'm gonna text it to you, okay?
okay.
got it. Hey, bobby. Get rid of my phone.
Charlie, get rid of your car.
but I just got it back.
that'll kill you. The coffee. It'll kill you.
you could have killed me. - But I didn't.
but you could have.
I saw his head by the window.
how did you know I wasn't standing right next to him?
because if he were here to kill you, he'd have made you stand over there.
what if he wasn't here to kill me?
then i'd have to kill you.
agent bodner, if he wasn't here to kill you, you're still working for roman.
and i'd have to kill you.
what's going on out there?
Roman has reese.
so what does roman want with you? - Rayborn.
but rayborn's dead.
Roman wants him anyway.
we should go.
we can't take that. - I just got it back.
my wife and kids are still gone. Maybe we can take her...
her what?
her minivan.
smooth ride.
four-star rating.
two dvd players. 16 cup holders.
what if roman was right?
what if rayborn is still alive?
I saw the pictures of that boat. How do you live through that?
people live through a lot of things you never thought they could.
yeah? Okay.
everyone's looking for roman nevikov.
maybe we should look for rayborn.
well, l.a. p.d.f. b.i.and that fancy security expert can't find his body.
his body. His sick body.
rayborn was sick, was having treatments almost every day.
if he is still alive, then
he still needs those treatments.
let's go see his doctor.
Mr. Rayborn was being treated for a very rare form of cancer.
Charlie would like the name of his doctor. Do you have that?
Yes, i do.
he never went anywhere without one of our men.
except the night he went missing.
he would take his boat out on his own.
I tried to dissuade him of that practice but he'd assured me that there were no pirates in los angeles.
this is the name of his doctor.
Thanks, ted. Stay there.
we might need ms. Puryer's services again.
sippy cup.
how long you been married?
20 years. Still love her.
Where'd you meet? - In the bureau.
we were partners.
there is something else you could do for me.
you wish me to find your olivia now?
my? She's not "my" olivia.
clearly.
we've got a dead f. b.i. Agent in there.
not the one who lives here.
we've got detective crews' car but no detective crews.
and we've tracked detective crews' cell phone to the trash can in your break room.
you find crews. He's on my cell.
you up for this?
Oh, yeah. I'm up for this.
that information is privileged.
look, doc, your patient might still be alive.
if he is, he's getting treatment somewhere.
you're not still treating mickey rayborn, are you?
no. I'm not still treating him.
doc, I'm gonna have to lock the door now.
you understand me?
you are l. a.p. d?
Yeah, but not at the moment.
and you're f. b.i. - but not at the moment.
then who are you at the moment?
I'm just a guy with one question-- what did mickey rayborn suffer from?
it's a very rare form of cancer.
and the treatment?
it's very technical.
but it made him weak.
it made him pale.
what did we find on that boat, agent bodner?
we found a lot of blood.
weak? Pale?
those are symptoms of blood loss, right, doc?
okay. I'm gonna lock the door.
he wasn't sick. He wasn't.
and the treatments? - I was stockpiling his blood.
it's a common practice.
patients do it before surgery all the time.
but he wasn't having surgery.
no. He wasn't.
it was for that boat.
to make us think he was dead. Enough so that we wouldn't question it.
he's been planning this for a while.
Yeah, he has. But why?
this is your plan?
my plan is on the way.
they put you away for killing that guy you owned that bar with?
you did 12 years hard time?
and you got $50 million?
now you're eating burgers in the back of a minivan on the run from half the cops in l. a.
you've made some interesting career choices.
I am where I am.
how far back you go with rayborn?
I don't go back with rayborn at all.
but that guy you owned that bar with.
you and him were laundering money for rayborn, right?
no, not me and him. Just him.
just him?
he was your friend and you didn't know?
I guess I didn't know him.
is this a private club or can anyone join?
that depends on if you got me what I asked for.
it's not zen, charlie.
it'll just have to do until zen comes along.
Charlie, i know she's your partner, but maybe you should let someone else
everyone else go after her.
Roman wants me. - Yeah.
why is that?
what is it, roman?
things not going according to plan?
he's getting closer, isn't he?
he's out there, but he's getting closer.
and you're hiding in this basement.
connection by connection...
until he's right in front of you.
that is where I want him.
sounds like you're in love, roman.
go ahead.
go ahead, cry. I will understand.
it runs in your family.
your father...
he cried before I killed him.
crews, he says he wants rayborn.
he says you bring rayborn to him...
you bring rayborn to him and I can go. Crews
there's something in the back.
we've e. q.ed out everything.
in the back we have dogs, russian techno, men's and women's voices
no, it's something else.
some other, uh, music. Keep working it.
captain tidwell.
may I see your phone, please?
my-- - your phone. Your cell phone.
it's in my office. I'll have to go get it.
I can't seem to find it.
I'm always losing it somewhere.
maybe someone picked it up by accident.
is it possible detective crews picked it up by accident?
anything's possible.
pull the vehicle over to the curb.
keep your hands where I can see them.
sure hope you kids got just cause for pulling us over because this man here is a federal agent and me?
I'm just in a real bad mood.
sir, i need to see your phones.
Oh, what do you know.
must have walked off with my captain's phone by accident.
they catch you with me, you're back in uniform-- if you're lucky.
they catch me with you, i'll say I'm bringing you in, i get promoted, and luck has nothing to do with it.
fair enough.
fair enough.
disposable phone.
who are you calling?
rayborn likes his pleasures.
if he disappears, he's going first-class.
his money is all still here.
come on, ted. A guy like rayborn must have undisclosed wealth.
well, undisclosed to the government, yes. But not to us.
we provide total protection, all aspects.
well, not all aspects.
we hadn't counted on having to protect mr. Rayborn from himself.
it's all there, charlie.
how much?
he's big. Bigger than you.
even bigger than I ever was, and we all know how big that was.
well, what about the cars, boat, jet?
it's all where he left it. He-- he just left everything sitting there.
took nothing but a plan. Thanks.
you never asked exactly what he was dying of?
well, i assumed he was reticent to speak of it.
I mean, powerful men are often loath to consider their own fragile mortality.
I'm a grandfather.
his name's ted, my grandson.
it's all over after that, right?
you're all done after you're a grandfather.
spain.
your olivia. In spain now.
I know. She's not "your" olivia.
rayborn leaves with nothing but a plan.
how do you live with no money?
how do you live with no money?
that's what I just said.
it's a good question.
how does he live with no money?
homeless shelters were part of mr. Rayborn's philanthropy.
how many shelters does he operate?
the rayborn foundation operates five homeless shelters in the greater los angeles area.
does he visit them? - Yes. Frequently.
does anyone from your office go with him?
of course.
does he visit all of them?
let me check his account.
no, he did not.
he only visited four of them.
so there's one where rayborn has never shown his face?
but I did know him.
Tom seybolt was my friend.
detective crews?
could I ask you to do something?
I need you to get a murder case file.
the seybolt killings.
okay, yeah. Sure.
you want to do this first?
found me, huh, kiddo?
I always knew you were a good cop.
crews, he says he wants rayborn.
not music but I know that sound.
says you bring rayborn to him...
you hear that? Listen.
I'm sorry, i don't hear anything.
it's a subway.
listen.
crews, he says he wants rayborn.
don't give me that look.
I know what a subway sounds like.
even if it is, there must be a truckload of places in l. a.
you could hear the subway from that level.
then we send a truckload of cops.
easy, kiddo.
I'm a dying man.
except you're not dying.
we're all dying.
some sooner than others.
detective crews.
this will not bring detective reese back.
Where's your partner, kiddo?
don't call me "kiddo.
get her back from whom?
you know the answer to that.
from roman nevikov.
what's he want for her?
you know the answer to that, too.
he wants me, does he?
I fooled everyone but the russian.
he would need to see my body.
even with all that blood, he'd need to see it.
so what are you going to do?
I'm gonna give you to roman.
it goes through six shell companies and two cousins but that building belongs to roman nevikov.
I know what a subway sounds like.
we got a body here.
captain, we have not secured that area yet!
follow him!
what does roman want with him?
Roman wants his money.
let's go get your partner back.
how do we let roman know that we have him?
that part is easy.
you are not under arresting me?
I was hoping we could work something out.
that will not be problem.
I just need you to talk.
okay.
you want me to be bad girl?
I need you to talk to your friends, and then they'll tell their friends,
and then roman will hear what charlie crews wants to tell him.
and-- and what is that?
head on out the 10.
I already read it.
the case file from your arrest.
when I found out I was assigned to you, i read it.
eh, you like to be prepared.
what do you want to know, detective crews?
I think you'd need to see it.
no, i don't.
I have a-- - photographic memory?
eidetic is the technical term, but yes, I have the ability to recall text with extreme accuracy and in abundant volume.
the man I owned that bar with-- the man who was murdered
what did they find in his desk?
the cops pulled evidence from his desk.
tax forms, uh, drawings that his kids made, a photo of you two fishing, an application.
for a cab license?
a cab license.
does that mean anything?
it means he needed a second job.
it means he need money.
I-if your friend was laundering money, why would he need a second job?
I knew my friend.
what if he wasn't laundering money?
if he wasn't dirty, then he wasn't killed because he was skimming.
so why'd they kill him?
if my friend was clean, if tom was clean, then maybe they went to lean on him to try to get him dirty.
he was a run-of-the-mill bar owner.
why get him dirty?
because he owned that bar with a cop.
if you get him dirty, you get a cop dirty.
you own him, you own a cop.
but that cop is you.
Seever, pull the car over.
the journey, kiddo, always leads back inside.
ain't that grand?
no, no, no.
you have to save reese.
you always knew I was a good cop?
what do you mean by "always"?
how long have you known me?
you are a good cop because you listen.
always" means before the killings, the arrest, the trial.
I saw you at the academy.
you had that look.
there.
that look.
what were you doing at the academy?
I knew someday i'd be old.
we'd need a younger man to run this thing.
I looked at every cadet, and I chose you.
I was gonna get that tom seybolt a little dirty so you would have to help him out.
now, that family was not supposed to die.
you were not supposed to go to jail.
but they did.
and you did.
but just look at you.
I chose you, kiddo.
and I was right.
I was right.
don't call me "kiddo.
it's always been about you, charlie.
even that animal roman knows that.
where is he?
where is rayborn?
I didn't bring him.
did you bring reese?
okay. Okay.
I do not trust you.
you do not trust me.
how do we do this?
easy.
I just need you to tell me one thing.
I need you to tell me why you want rayborn.
because I do.
no.
that's just how bad you want him, not why.
is it just the money? 'Cause I don't think it's just the money.
if you want reese, you bring him to me.
then tell me why you want him.
okay. Then you can't have him.
but you can have this.
that's the bullet you wanted bodner to kill me with.
it's my gift to you.
this-- this is why he
this is why he what, roman?
nothing.
nothing.
there can't be nothing.
I am not attached to that gun.
thank you ever so much.
where are you going?
the police have mr. Rayborn and detective seever.
I am going to fetch mr. Rayborn now.
what about charlie?
seems to have gone missing.
how did they find them?
rayborn and seever.
how did the police find them?
well, i told them where to look.
why would you do that?
Cliome mr. Earley.
you and detective crews are terribly sweet and serious gentlemen, but mickey rayborn's my client.
now, i must do my job, mustn't i?
rayborn told the brass you saved his life.
got you a promotion.
you know why he did that, right?
Yes, i do.
because now I owe him.
crews was gonna trade rayborn for reese.
that's right.
so what's he gonna do now?
you want me to talk again?
Yeah.
and what shall I say this time?
I'll write it down for you.
Charlie wants to know if roman likes oranges.
you own this orange grove?
bought it when I first got out.
don't get out here as much as i'd like to.
not sure I understand you.
not sure I do, either.
having a little trouble with my math today.
math?
now I'm sure I do not understand you.
detective new money.
you are there?
I am here.
I am bringing her to you.
is rayborn there?
Yes.
let me hear you say it.
rayborn is here.
okay.
I see any other cop cars, helicopters, i shoot reese in the head and leave her on road.
what do you mean, your math?
Oh, you know.
adding things up.
well, i guess I understand that.
how's the family, agent bodner?
getting along.
still on holiday?
you must miss them so.
okay.
I don't see rayborn.
sure you do.
he's right here.
but he's not. Shoot her.
this is why he what, roman?
you know what I'm talking about.
wait, wait.
what you said to me-- it's why he what?
why rayborn what, roman?
why he didn't choose you?
is that what?
where is rayborn?
well, as I said, you're looking right at him.
whatever you want from rayborn, you can get it from me now.
his accounts, his connections-- everything he knew, i know.
but it's just the money, right?
that's all you want.
you for her.
me for her.
bring her out.
just breathe.
no, no. No touching.
no tricks.
search him.
what was his plan getting in that s. u.v?
his plan was getting you out of that s. u.v.
he calls you an animal.
he calls you an animal.
but it's not so bad, because I've seen him with his dog, and he loves
he loves that animal, so you know.
it's not so bad.
I'll need his account numbers.
foreign and domestic.
keys to safety deposit boxes.
combinations to home and office safes.
you will give me these things.
sure.
but that's not what you want.
what you want is what rayborn gave me.
you want him to choose you.
you want what he gives his dog.
you want his
what are those numbers?
do you want to know how I got through 12 years of prison?
your zen?
like that.
whatever he had on you and your families is gone.
so we can start over right now, or we can go on killing.
you fellas do speak english?
what we learned as children,
we know to be false.
went to spain
one plus one equals one.
we even have a word for when you plus another equals one.
that word...
is love.
you and someone had a kid, you gave up that kid, I am that kid and now I'm applying for emancipation.
from the people who adopted you?
from foster care.
um, Cate Cassidy - that's your mom.
I am Cate Cassidy.
Ryan and I has been up since 5: 00.
and, as usual, arguing since 6: 00.
Hey, what are you doing? - Will you marry me?
meet Lux, our daughter.
you never even told me I've got a kid out there.
why would I? You wouldn't even admit that she existed.
I am not granting you emancipation.
I'm releasing you back into their temporary joint custody.
bug, what are you doing?
giving your new friends a night they won't forget.
Hey!
what happened? Where's Lux?
her boyfriend stole my car.
what? I'm calling the police.
Oh, my God.
there has to be a better way of waking up than this.
I can think of one.
okay. I'm going to be right back.
I can't do morning sex with morning breath.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
what are you doing?
what does it look like? Hey.
eyes forward. What's going on?
what? What? Oh, no, no, no.
this is not okay.
did you sleep here again?
again? - Yeah, Lux and I were watching TV.
Hey, did you know that The Real World is still on?
she's never even seen it.
I passed out during Hawaii, woke up to San Diego.
there coffee?
I'll get rid of him.
looks like Baze is making himself right at home.
how long has this been going on?
Oh. Last week or two.
you're up early.
what's with the iron? Is it school picture day?
bug's arraignment.
for the whole stealing Jones's car unfortunate-ness.
I mean, he eats here, sleeps here, pees here.
wait. Are you skipping school? - Baze got Lux in a car accident...
because you cannot miss school.
Baze said I could.
he lets her bartend at his loft.
I mean, what's-what's next?
you two going to get arrested and thrown in jail together?
Oh, wait. That already happened.
I'll be doing upstairs stuff.
look... a month ago, I had no idea Baze existed.
now, suddenly, he's spending nights here.
look, the last person that I'm going to defend is Baze.
I want to check my couch for drool marks.
I just want less Baze in our lives.
does that make me a bad guy?
it makes you like the rest of us.
you're up early.
never went to bed.
guess you didn't, either.
up top.
it wasn't like that.
I was hanging with Lux and...
kind of fell asleep at Cate's.
again?
dude, it was a matter of time before this whole dad thing killed your game.
what?
I got game?
you used to be the king of the random hookup.
like Wilt Chamberlain, only shorter.
and... whiter.
now look at you.
you're... Math.
I take offense to that.
the last time I had sex was 22 minutes ago.
you?
and I'm not talking Tracey. Ex-girlfriends don't count.
I'm talking random, meaningless, "I don't remember exactly what happened" sex.
okay.
but you cannot tell Math.
16 years ago doesn't count.
no, a month ago.
when Lux first showed up.
what?
do you have a death wish or something?
dude, why would you go there?
there's plenty of sex to be had that isn't so loaded.
you don't need to re-screw the girl you already screwed.
it just happened.
things like that don't just happen.
unless you...
you have a thing for Cate.
no, I don't. - Yes, you do.
no, I don't.
there is no thing.
okay. All right.
then, prove it.
sleep with someone else. - Fine.
but don't call me Math.
so, I'm confused.
I just started listening. So, you and Cate have a kid together?
Oh, no, no, no. Baze and I have a kid.
I'm sorry. Who's Blaze?
Baze. He's not a pony.
and that's who you got engaged to?
no. Ryan and I- we are engaged.
thanks for calling, Kathy.
does anyone have a question that is not about Baze?
how about, uh, Denise from West Linn?
Hey, Ryan. I love you.
I can't believe you and Cate are engaged.
I didn't think she'd ever stop skanking around.
right here, Denise.
so, when's the wedding?
we have not picked a date yet.
summer's nice. - If you want to be a big giant cliche, yeah
I mean, why do people want to pigeonhole you and stuff you into this... this little box to confine you to this one date that you arbitrarily pick because that's the opening that the Holiday Inn ballroom has available? I mean, come on.
you know what I mean, Denise, right?
Denise? - Uh, yeah. Denise, she hung up.
okay. Fine. Let me start from the beginning.
I'm just saying, first, you're single, and everyone wants to know when you're going to find someone,
you know, they constantly regardless of whether the person is actually right for you.
what? - So, this is you not hung up on Cate?
I told you, I'm not. I mean, do you hear her?
who'd be hung up on that?
it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and...they start talking babies...
she's grating, right? Her voice?
Yes, yes.
it's like seagulls fighting over a cheese sandwich.
funny. - Thanks.
so, um, do you... do you...
do you come here often?
is this you picking me up?
well, this... s-s-sort of, maybe.
I'm not from here.
okay.
shut up.
I've got a venti, no foam, no whip, not gettg any for the big guy right here.
this is crap, man. I'm not taking a plea.
you know, most people facing two years in prison would think six months is a pretty good deal.
Oh, you mean the other clients you don't give a rat's ass about?
he didn't steal the car.
I was borrowing it.
that's not what the plaintiff says.
the plaintiff is a brownnosing pretty boy.
and what, I'm going to go to jail on his say-so?
you know, I got to get to my next case.
when you figure it out, you let me know.
bug, this isn't juvie court.
you could go to jail for two years.
you would be 20, and-and I'd be 18.
I know it sucks, but you have to take the plea.
for us.
I got a better idea.
my idiot attorney says if Jones doesn't testify, then there's no case.
how are you going to get him not to?
I'm not. You are.
come on, Lux.
talk to Jones. For us.
we have a serious problem.
corporate is here.
what?
corporate is here. They flew in from Chicago last night, but no one bothered to tell me...
Hey, guys. - Hey!
how are you guys? Hey. - Oh, it's so good to see you.
thank God. When I saw you guys coming, I was so worried that Trina was...
Hey, Trina.
it... it's been forever.
nine months since I last saw you.
you actually remember.
it's hard to forget you getting drunk at a corporate retreat and knocking over an ice sculpture.
well, this is a...a rare treat.
since you don't usually oversee our show.
only when there's a problem.
what's the problem?
not what.
who.
so, there's good news and bad news.
the good news...is people still love Ryan.
as for Cate...
three weeks ago, you were K-100's single, sharp-tongued darling.
two weeks ago, you're an unwed mother of a rescue teen.
today, you are half of an engaged couple who won't pick a wedding date, who spends an inordinate amount of time talking about some guy named Blaze.
Baze. Uh, his name- it's Baze.
I don't care if his name is Brad Pitt,
george Clooney, and the big eyebrow dude from Twilight.
thanks to you, the audience is completely confused.
do you know what people who tune in do when they get confused?
they tune out.
we need to clear up this confusion.
people need a Who's Who to understand the manscape that is your life.
if we don't, your partnership with Ryan at least on air- is over.
Hey, look, it's Slumdog.
I can wait here while you talk to him.
or come back later. - You can wait here.
sup, Prison Break?
Yeah, bite me, asshat!
or come back later.
great party last weekend, huh?
you know, minus the whole car debacle.
debacle means...
I know what it means.
so I need to talk to you about something.
like a favor.
the charges against Bug- I- I need you to drop them.
you're kidding, right?
just?
look...
I know that you don't know him, and you don't know me.
and yeah, maybe he made a mistake, a big one.
but he doesn't deserve to go to jail or have a record follow him around for the rest of his life.
I'll do anything.
I will wash your car for a year... anything.
just... let Bug off the hook.
okay.
but he's got to pay for what he did.
how about I take that bike?
what bike?
bug's motorcycle.
the Norton?
my dad took my Jeep. Punishment for partying.
I need wheels, and Bug's got two good ones.
he'd never give that bike up.
his dad gave him that.
I guess we'll see what matters more: the bike or you.
she had tables and graphs and everything.
I mean, I have never...I've never had my likeability put on a pie chart.
I mean, she couldn't actually split us up, could she?
she could fire us. - What would I do?
teach community college?
I could do voice-overs for feminine hygiene products.
I mean, I have no transferable skills.
do you remember when she said that my voice gave her night blindness?
well, she's got a way with words.
this makes walking in on Baze peeing this morning seem pretty harmless.
actually, this makes Baze peeing where we live highly symbolic because you would rather talk about him than pick a wedding date.
are you serious right now?
that you can't go two seconds without bringing up his name?
it's not exactly less Baze, Cate.
you guys, Trina wants to talk to us. Now.
Hey, I-I'm looking for a, uh...
coffee lady?
bedhead troller?
you clean up well.
and apparently don't take no for an answer?
hmm. I'm here to see a, uh...
she just called me.
wait a second.
you're who I just spoke to on the phone?
I can't believe this.
you're Baze?
no. This-This is not happening.
this is not an option.
Trina, you said so yourself, all right?
we need less confusion. People want less of this guy, not more.
like I said, our audience needs to understand where Cate stands with the men in her life.
Cate, Ryan, meet your cohost for tomorrow's show.
Hi. I'm Cate. And this is Morning Madness
can't believe you get up this early every day.
I cannot believe that you're really going through with this.
well, believe it, lady.
Trina's letting me promote my bar on the air.
she's scratching my back, and if I'm lucky, I'm gonna scratch hers.
you disgust me.
this what we're reading from?
you two, just hit all the talking points and take caller questions.
Baze, be yourself.
sound good? Great.
and you're on in five...
good morning, Portland.
you're joining Morning Madness with Cate and Ryan.
now, as most of you know, a lot of stuff has come out about us lately, and by us, I mean mostly Cate.
Ah, a teen pregnancy, estranged daughter, secret engagement.
just another day at the office.
so to clear up the Days of Our Lives episode that is Cate's life, we have a very special guest.
the source of much of this confusion, the mystery man from the minivan... And, proprietor of Open Bar, a hopping joint on Third and Clover.
...Mr. Nate Bazile.
or as the Portland P. D. fondly refer to him, Baze.
what up, Portland...!
thanks for taking me to school.
you'll never believe what Baze is doing.
what happened with Jones?
well, he said he'd drop the charges...
But?
but you have to give him your bike.
screw that.
we're talking about jail.
Yeah, I know, but...
you told me to do this for us, and I did, so now what? I don't get it.
your bike is more important than us?
you think Abercrombie even knows how to ride?
you recently found out about the daughter you and Cate had together, and you reached out to Cate.
what was that reunion like with her?
well, Ryan, my feelings were mixed.
I mean, part of me felt like I'd just been kicked in the gut.
but at the same time, I sort of felt like I'd been punched in the face.
I guess what I'm trying to say is, she's mean.
okay, um, let's just remind everyone that you had just ambushed me on air.
you had told the entire greater Portland area that I was pregnant in high school.
Oh, please. You're a human ambush.
you ambush on autopilot like a ninja.
Ryan, back a brother up.
Ah, do you ever just listen to yourself?
you don't even make any sense. You're not even saying anything.
see? Mean.
great. Can you hold, please?
heads up.
bike's out front.
now we're even.
okay, let's go to the phones.
we have Jesse from Greenway on the line.
Jesse, what is your question?
I'd like to know how it started. Did you guys go out in high school?
Oh, God, no. No.
I was popular, athletic. Popular.
Cate's best friend was a dictionary.
she went to prom with a thesaurus.
Really? And who'd you go with?
herpes simplex 2?
no. What I'm saying is she wasn't exactly my type.
Yeah, because I had standards and a brain.
you're right.
bookworm virgin with padded bras?
way hotter.
I was going to cut the rest of classes.
help me start it, and I'll give you a ride.
with the guy who stole my boyfriend's bike?
Thanks, but no.
I just called my dad.
told him I wasn't going to testify.
bug's off the hook. Okay? No jail.
you're a real hero.
Hey, I'm not the bad guy here.
that's your boyfriend.
get on the back.
what are you doing?
I want to show you something.
you know why we didn't hang in high school? 'Cause you were scared.
scared of what?
okay, so Cate, you have one kid, but now with Baze in your life...
cause I was the kind of girl that could see right through you.
...It's like you have two.
the only thing I was scared of was your corrective head gear.
Oh, my God. Exhibit A: Any time a real issue is brought up,
it was gone by junior year!
and we have an anonymous caller for Baze again.
I'd like to agree with Cate. Baze sounds like he's deflecting.
thank you.
almost like he's sexually frustrated.
Jamie, is that you?
we have got another caller.
Lorena from Hillsboro.
I just want to say, best show ever.
I love the two of you.
Oh, well, thank you. Thank you so much.
Ryan and I- we-we aim to please.
I meant you and Baze.
you have crazy chemistry, and it sure doesn't sound like things ended in high school.
Oh, my God, no way. - Uh, just once.
once was more than anyone should ever have to go through.
one time. Uno.
turns out I'm the biggest idiot around.
okay, I get that you're mad. I get it.
I've-I've been a nice guy, right?
I've been a good guy?
Yeah, you are an amazing guy.
I was patient and understanding when you treated my marriage proposal like a joke.
when Lux moved in, when that-that... that dumb ape, Baze, started messing with our personal and public lives,
I took it like a freaking champ.
now, all I asked for was a little less of him, and now, he's in my booth, in my station, screwing with my career
something I have worked at my entire life.
right. So have I.
I did not want Baze on the show either.
Kate, you're the reason he is.
thanks to your fixation over him over the last few weeks, all of Portland is-is confused about Cate and Ryan.
and you know what?
so am I.
whoa, what are we talking about?
do you have feelings for him, for Baze?
what? - Come on, Cate.
come on, the night of that turtle thing,
I saw, I saw the two of you sitting at his bar.
okay, I saw how you were together.
are... are you kidding me?
no, I'm not.
and that look between you two just now when, when Lorena from Hillsboro called and asked you that question?
has anything ever happened between you guys since high school?
Ryan, no, nothing has happened.
I mean, you believe me, right?
honestly?
Yeah.
I don't know what I believe anymore.
not exactly Nob Hill, right?
what are we doing here?
this house that's where Bug grew up.
what? Am I supposed to feel sorry for him?
come on.
bug's dad's in jail - dealer turned convict.
I don't think we should be back here.
when Bug was nine, his mom OD'd while he was playing in the yard back here.
she was okay eventually, but she checked out of his whole childhood and let his dad beat the crap out of him until Child Protective Services took Bug away.
so, then, why does he want to keep that bike if it was his dad's?
listen.
a while ago, I got placed in this foster home out in Gresham.
it was as bad as this place.
this one Christmas, the mom - she was... awful.
but she gave me this locket.
it was cheap costume jewelry that someone had given her and she didn't want, but I wore it until it broke and fell off my neck.
I guess I held on to it because I don't know. It's...It's better than having nothing.
and that's what Bug has: nothing.
he can have his bike back.
okay?
he can have it.
I don't even want it anymore.
Really?
you'd do that for Bug?
it's not just for Bug, and, uh, you're wrong about one thing.
he doesn't have nothing.
he has you.
what are you doing? - Sorry, I...
I have a boyfriend.
no, I know. - Bug and I are together.
that was the whole point of all of this.
no, I mean, I have a girlfriend, I know.
you know what?
let's just get out of here.
you can drive. I- I don't care.
I just want to go home.
you live above a bar?
of course you do.
not classy enough for you?
today's show-and day drinking has opened my eyes to your unique appeal.
talking out of my butt and drinking like a fish?
exactly.
you are so wrong.
you drive a truck, listen to Starship.
how long was your longest relationship?
hmm, three weeks, maybe four.
I bet you have a roommate.
two.
Jamie, it's the beer guy!
I'm busy.
you okay?
what?
Yeah, no, sorry.
Oh, my God.
wait.
wait. Cate, come on.
let me explain.
explain? I mean, I just walked in on you on top of my boss.
Oh, God, that image, I- I just...
I feel assaulted.
you essentially just raped my eyes.
would you just relax? It's not like it meant anything.
Oh, that's reassuring.
Hey, why, why do you even care?
I don't.
I just...
I think that sex is supposed to mean something, you know, ideally, and so if you're doing it with Trina, it obviously doesn't.
you said it yourself: when you and I had sex, it meant nothing.
when you and I did it, did it mean something or not?
look.
I'm with Ryan, okay?
I am in love with Ryan, and...
I just came here to ask you to back off.
right, because something did.
God, Cate, if you're that stressed out, grow a pair and tell him the truth.
why, because you, you're such an honest, stand-up guy?
you always go around telling people the truth?
I'm not the one with a fiance that I am lying to every day.
Ryan wants less of you in our lives.
that's what I came here to say.
so do I.
what the hell?
you take my bike like a little bitch, - and now you're up on my girl? - Bug, no.
dude, relax. - Don't tell me to relax, bro.
bug, leave it. He's giving you your bike back.
Yeah, you need to chill.
you take one more step and I will kick your face in.
this is a freaking joke. You're getting me to take this plea "for us,
to give my bike to Abercrombie here "for us"?
it was for us.
you want to be with this guy, just say it.
I don't.
stop lying. What happened with you?
nothing!
where were you? Nowhere.
we just drove around.
yeah? Were you as easy with him as you were with me?
you know what, dude? That is enough.
stop!
I can't believe you.
what, you think he likes you? He's using you.
he's not going to love you like I do.
no one is.
you okay? - Yeah, I'm good.
Lux, get in the house.
you, get off my property, or I will call the cops.
Hey, so I, uh, I gave Jones a ride home.
he's going to be all right.
Thanks.
does he act like that a lot- Bug?
sometimes.
he's not really good with people not wanting him.
go figure.
imagine what he would have done if I told him that Jones tried to kiss me.
wait. What?
I- I pushed him away.
it's nothing. It's stupid.
I don't really want to talk about it.
you don't have to feel bad for having feelings for more than one person.
I don't.
it's not like you, with Ryan and Baze.
um, well, there is no me and Baze.
no, I-I know you're with Ryan, and he's who you want to be with, but...
I don't know...
you and Baze are you and Baze.
okay, look, um, what Bug said to you
I know that must have hurt.
you are not any more damaged than anyone else.
I know you.
you may have been through more, sure, but we are all damaged:
me, you, Bug.
I mean, if I wasn't, how could I have slept with Baze behind Ryan's back?
why did you?
cause when I'm around Baze, it's like I'm still in high school.
I still feel like the girl in the head gear, you know, dating her dictionary, wanting him to notice me.
you know, it's like he taps into this screwed-up part of me that wants him to...
I don't know, um...
think I'm good enough.
it's pretty messed up, huh?
do you have feelings for him, for Baze?
do I have feelings for Baze? Yeah.
Yeah, I have angry feelings.
rejected feelings.
you know, deep down I'm sure that I have good feelings.
but what I feel for Baze, it's nothing like I feel for Ryan.
and it's definitely not love.
and the way that Bug was to you down there, the way that he spoke to you...
you know, that's not love, either.
if I tell him the truth...
if I tell him where I was today or about Jones...
he's gonna be so mad.
he already is.
you have to tell him that you deserve better, Lux.
what if he leaves me?
so what, you can lie to Bug about where you were and what happened with Jones and how you feel about the way that he's treating you you know, just to hold onto him?
but then your whole relationship - it's not real.
it's not honest.
if I tell him the truth...
I could lose him.
what if I lose him?
maybe that's a risk you have to take.
Lux, hey.
Hey.
Hey. Hi.
I wanted to talk to you.
you, uh... wanna come in?
I'm okay.
this won't take long.
when you asked me where I was today,
I was with Jones.
I was showing him where you grew up so that he would understand.
and when you asked me if anything had happened between us...
I lied.
about Baze.
I was just scared to tell you.
um... something did happen.
you know, that night that...that Lux took off...
we drove around looking for her.
I mean, it was after the hearing and we tried to call Social Services,
we just really didn't know where to go or what to do so...
we ended up back at Baze's bar.
you know, and we started talking about high school and the winter formal and... you know, how we got together in the first place.
just say it, Cate.
he kissed me.
Baze did.
what else?
just say it, Cate. What else happened?
did you sleep with him?
just don't even tell me you slept with him.
I did not sleep with him.
of course I didn't sleep with him.
he kissed me.
I pushed him away. That's all.
I swear, I told him to stop.
that I had a boyfriend and to take me home.
and I wanted to tell you.
I would have.
but when we pulled up, you were already so mad.
I never meant to lie to you.
I mean, I wasn't even thinking about it as lying.
I just... I really didn't want to make a big deal about something that meant nothing.
you know, but if I'd just told you right when it happened...
I mean, what if I just told you right when it happened?
I would have tried to understand.
I'm trying to undersnd now.
I mean, that's what you do when you love someone.
and I do.
I love you.
even if Baze tries to kiss you, I love you.
I just...
I just wish you would have told me the truth.
so, us...
what do we do?
well, first, I'm gonna punch that guy's lights out.
and then, um...
I don't know.
we get married, maybe?
I don't deserve a guy like you.
you want better, go find better.
no one's stopping you.
what?
what am I supposed to say?
I don't know! Anything!
I'm sorry," maybe?
I don't get this side of you.
it's like you turn into your...
don't say it.
it's true.
you become your dad.
you should go be with Abercrombie.
that's not what I'm saying.
no, you're right. You deserve better.
I don't want to be my dad.
I never wanna be that guy with you.
no, Bug, that's not...
you need to go.
you shouldn't be with me.
go.
should I be worried that not a single person is looking at me in the eye?
think positive.
I'm fired, for sure. - That's the spirit.
I would say that you make me sick except I wanna kiss both of you right now.
great news: Yesterday's show went over huge!
even corporate was impressed.
Trina almost smiled. - I don't believe it.
after hearing you and Baze, our listeners, they feel like they know you better and they wanna root for you, especially after hearing how big a sad-sack you were in high school.
I guess we have Baze to thank.
uh, I don't think so.
and it's awkward.
Oh, you're on in ten.
nine, eight...
Hey, everybody, it's Hump Day.
it's bright and early on a Wednesday morning. June 26.
now, hold on there. It's not summer yet.
no, June 26.
it's a Saturday.
it's also Flag Day in Romania.
and it's the day that Ryan took me to his favorite Italian restaurant.
after watching me annihilate four cannolis, he still wanted to make out.
and it's the date that Ryan and I will be getting married.
unless you have any objections.
I like June 26.
some of you might remember a little rant I went on a couple of days ago about how being married is like being stuck in a box.
the thing is, being stuck, it isn't so bad if you've got the right guy to stick it out with you.
Hey, rounding up some dudes for some late-night poker.
or are you gonna be at Cate's?
actually, I'm gonna lay off hanging at Cate's for a while.
all right.
you're in.
so. June 26. I'm thinking big not huge but appropriately over the top of it.
I would love a huge smile on your face
maybe. You know maybe even a tear or two when you see me walking down the aisle
Hey, are you okay?
why wouldn't I be?
I was just worried, you and Bug...
I said I'm fine, Jones.
it's just I got you this necklace.
Hey, Gavin.
you okay? What's wrong?
what happened?
bug left.
Gavin said he's gone.
I did what you said. I told him the truth, and he left.
I mean, what should I have done?
lied so he'd stay?
you did the right thing.
you did.
and, as usual, arguing since 6: 00.
you have met the qualifications as foster parents and will be granted temporary joint custody of Lux.
Cate, you will be Lux's primary caregiver.
that means that Lux is only allowed to live at Cate's.
Oh, my God, tell me this didn't happen. - It happened twice.
he kissed me. Baze did.
did you sleep with him?
I did not sleep with him.
of course I didn't sleep with him.
Ryan wants less of you in our lives. So do I.
okay, okay,"Look Away" by Chicago best break-up song ever.
Mr. Mister- that's, that's a break-up song.- Oh, no, no, no, I will see your Mr. Mister, and I, I will raise you Roxette
if you're a 14-year-old girl in the '80s.
breakups turn us all into 14-year-old girls in the '80s.
well, personally, I like to focus on the positive side of breakups.
wearing your sweatpants all day and eating your weight in ice cream?
rebound sex.
wow, life gives you lemons, you make skank-ade.
uh, and when we get back, get your dialing fingers ready because we will be selecting the 19th contestant for this weekend's "Hands on a Hybrid" contest.
Oh, and if you're still not sure what the hell that means, stay tuned.
how is school today?
here.
this will help. I promise.
rocky Road?
it's a metaphor...
that you can eat.
bug's gone, and I'm the one who drove him away.
he drove himself away...
on his motorcycle after you asked him to treat you better.
it's all just kind of a blur.
that's what breakups do.
they confuse things.
they make you doubt yourself and get back in bed in the middle of the day.
that is why you need this.
retail therapy.
I guess some arm warmers could take the edge off.
boyfriend leaving aside...
this has all been pretty great lately.
Thanks.
of course.
a - And you probably know this by now
I mean, if you don't, you should.
whatever you need, I'm here.
Cate Cassidy, the perfect mom.
you're bummed and she gives you cash for clothes.
what happens when you get a case of the frownies?
is she going to buy you a pony?
bet you won't be complaining when Cate's cash buys you a scarf.
or that.
some prospective foster parents are coming to meet me tonight.
last thing I want is to get picked by two flakes just looking for someone to baby-sit their other kids.
then get it.
nothing says "low-maintenance, lovable teen with no issues" like a dress with metal studs.
it looks expensive.
it is not what I can pay for it
don't. Why not? We used to do it all the time.
what, are you, like, above it now?
I'll wait here.
you'll need someone to be your one phone call when you get arrested.
wimp.
Lux! Anybody home? Cate?
what is he doing here?
Hey, I can see you guys.
okay, don't say anything.
about him trying to kiss you?
it happened. We're past it.
there's no need to stir things up.
it's open!
please.
Hey, hey.
little grocery shopping?
how observant.
what are you doing here?
I was gonna see if Lux wanted to grab a bite, maybe hit the arcade.
whack-a-mole does wonders for a break-up.
she's not here.
she's shopping with Tasha.
Oh, I can wait.
well, that's probably not a good idea.
what, you got big plans?
you gonna bore her to death?
actually, I'm taking her driving.
wait.
don't you think that's more of a dad type duty?
well, when she's here, I kind of fill that role.
I'm sorry. What? - You heard me.
okay. Why don't you just come back tomorrow?
uh, you guys can whack moles then.
because right now we're sort of in the middle of a whole family thing, so...
Yeah.
don't let me intrude on a family thing.
nerve of that guy.
okay, just let it go.
look, he got a pass today.
next time, I say something.
Oh, I love shopping.
why is your face all scrunched?
nothing.
let's get out of here.
I mean, I'm not wrong, am I?
driving lessons are a rite of passage for a dad.
no, you're not wrong.
seriously, that's your best move?
and then the guy basically runs me out of the house.
are you sure that's what he did? You're not exaggerating just a little?
get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Damn it!
you know what it is?
this controller's broken.
you want to switch controllers? Cause I swich the controllers
okay, I need you two to listen.
I actually have a legit problem here.
Cate and Ryan want less of me in their lives, but the only way I get to be with Lux is to be over there.
how am I supposed to be a good dad if I can't even get any time with her?
okay, let me drop some knowledge on you.
Ryan is like the new silverback in the jungle.
like the gorilla? - Yeah. Primal dynamics.
he sets up shop, moves in against the females, and asserts his dominance over the chump gorilla.
that's you. - No, it's not.
what are you talking about?
you're not even making sense.
okay, before you know it, you're on the outs, picking out your own fleas, looking in on their banana party.
maybe Ryan's just trying to be helpful.
Yeah, I'm sure that's what the chump gorilla thought, too.
Ryan is moving in on his dad role.
he's already giving Lux driving lessons. What's next? Parent-Teacher Night?
dropping her off at college?
he's walking her down the aisle?
Jamie's right. I'm the chump gorilla.
I got to out-gorilla him. I got to stand up, beat my chest, and wreck his banana party.
or you could just talk to him.
no, man, no.
I cannot just sit back and watch this guy replace me, that is for sure.
I'm gonna teach this guy that Lux has one dad.
and that's me.
COM and now, we're back with Cate and Ryan.
good morning, Portland.
we're so glad that you could be joining us on this Friday morning.
especially since today is the last day to win the last spot in K-100's "Hands on a Hybrid" competition.
now, for those of you who are unfamiliar, this is a contest where 20 K-100 fans engage in a battle of will to win a top-of-the-line hybrid by keeping one hand on the car for as long as possible.
final hand on the car wins.
now, last year's contest set a record 39 hours.
we have 19 contestants lined up already.
plus me, your favorite radio host and incidentally, last year's champion.
wow, it suddenly got really cramped here in the booth with me,
Ryan, and Ryan's humongous ego.
come on! Come on, if I win, the car goes to charity.
Oh, right, correction: Ryan's charitable ego.
so, be the 100th caller right now for your chance to win a car.
or, you know, as I like to think of it: beating Ryan.
what will Cate and Ryan say next?
what?
you tell your hotshot fianc that starting this afternoon,
I'll be giving Lux driving lessons.
and if there's any other dad stuff to be done,
I'll be the one doing it.
that's what I'm talking about.
okay, I'm at work right now.
let's talk about Lux later, all right?
is that Baze?
not anymore.
dude, she just hung up on me.
call her back. - I'll call her back.
Hey, it's Cate. Leave a message.
she just turned off her phone. - Call the station.
I'm calling the station.
it's busy. - Keep dialing. Come on.
what are you doing here?
that family wants me from last night.
the foster family.
okay, what's it this time?
eight kids, want a live-in maid?
or they just want the government check?
they're three hours away.
I'd live three hours away. - Wait. What?
I told my case worker...
you can't go that far.
we've never been that far.
she said I didn't have a choice.
how soon are they coming? - I've got two days.
well, you have to get out of it.
we have to find someone else.
Lux, you know how it is.
once you're assigned to a foster home, you're gone.
you're going to think I'm crazy.
I think I saw your mom.
what?
yesterday.
outside that store. Where you stole the dress. - There's no way.
last time I talked to my mom, she bailed on rehab and was serving out a two-year sentence for whatever.
it looked just like her, Tash.
I swear.
and you didn't...
you didn't say anything?
was she that bad?
no, that's the thing.
she was with this guy, like-like in a suit.
there was a minivan, kids...
okay, definitely not her.
now if you told me she was with a doper ned Double Wide and holding a meth pipe, then I'd believe you.
it was her.
I know it.
I wanted to say something, but it all just happened so fast.
and-and I-I wanted to check it out before, you know, you-you got your hopes up.
but this could be the answer you need.
what if instead of going three hours away to another crappy foster home, you stayed right here?
with your mom?
wake up.
she's a junkie, not a soccer mom.
I'm not you.
no one's gonna appear out of nowhere and save the day.
some of us don't have anyone.
you have me.
and I'm not letting you go.
and we're back.
and we have our 100th caller on the line.
and congratulations!
you are the 20th and final contestant for tomorrow's "Hands on a Hybrid" competition.
how do you feel about being stuck... - Cate?
that's right.
what are you doing?
I'm calling to finish our conversation.
why don't you call back later, Baze?
uh, the adults are working here.
you know what?
there's no need to finish our conversation.
the contest sounds like a much better way to finish things.
you count me in.
and you know what else?
you can tell your pretty boy fianc to get ready because I am going to kick his ass.
Baze in the contest?
no, this is a disaster.
do you know what's going to happen if Baze and Ryan are trapped on a car for any length of time?
okay, Baze hasn't said anything about the drunken sex for this long.
so I doubt he's going to say anything now. Right?
I did something else.
Oh, God...
okay.
last week, you know, after Baze was on the show,
Ryan - he confronted me, and asked if anything's ever happened between us since high school and, um...
I lied.
I know, I told Ryan that Baze made a pass at me and I pushed him away.
you are so Days of Our Lives.
I'm gonna have to start tuning in at 1: 00 to watch you.
radical thought here.
why not just tell Baze that you lied to Ryan?
tell Baze that I threw him under the bus to save my relationship and that's why he hasn't been seeing his daughter?
he's just going to tell Ryan the truth.
and what about you, Cate?
are you ever going to tell Ryan the truth?
I don't know. I...
Alice, I have just made a mess out of everything.
and I don't know how to get out of this without losing everything that I care about.
Oh, sweetie.
I have to tell him.
I just...
I need to figure out how and when, and I will.
but in the meantime, could you just pull Baze out of the contest?
Oh, Cate, I love you.
but the station - they're already promoting a Ryan/Baze showdown.
and people - they're excited.
I'm people. And I'm not excited. - I know.
and I'm sorry, but Baze is in.
okay, I'm here. What's the 911?
good news.
I did some recon.
I called that rehab place your mom bailed on, and they said that she eventually completed her program at another facility, so I called that place and I got her address.
Seriously?
Yeah, it wasn't that hard.
I just to pretend that I was with her insurance company.
no, I mean...you have my mom's address?
she's still in town, T.
I went to the house to confirm it.
same minivan and everything.
I pretended to be on the phone.
I took a picture as I walked by.
my God, it's her.
she looks really good. - I know.
this is the answer, T.
if she's recovered, then she can take you in and-and you won't have to move away.
no, it's not.
if she's recovered and she hasn't tried to get me back, she doesn't want me.
you don't know that.
and-and the last time you saw her, didn't you tell her you hated her and never wanted to see her again?
cause she was high on dope on my birthday.
Yeah.
well, maybe she hasn't tried to get you back because she thinks that you don't want her.
think about it. You haven't taken any of her phone calls or ansred any of her letters.
maybe she'been waiting aund for you all this time.
what if I go over there and she doesn't want me? Okay, then what?
then you're no worse off than you are now.
what you need to do is train.
put your hand on the bar.
all right, now, imagine yourself deep in the competition.
you and Ryan are head-to-head.
your feet are tired.
your back is sore.
and you smell funky, then suddenly...
dude! You got to work on your focus, man.
math's girlfriend's here.
Hey. Can we talk? - Yeah.
I need you to drop out of the contest tomorrow. - What?
you afraid your hotshot fianc is gonna lose?
cause you should be.
all right, look, I - I know that you and I - we're not in the best place, but Ryan and I, we finally are.
and for as cool as he seems, you're an issue for him.
so it would just be great if you could you know...
back off.
do you even care that that guy's bogarting my fatherly duties?
because he cares about Lux.
you know, he is going to be in her life.
he wants to provide for her, and give her things that she's never had.
things you don't think that I can give her?
that's not what I said. - But that's what you meant.
God, Cate, I am so sick of you and Ryan acting like I can't be a good parent to Lux.
she's been in our lives the same amount of time, Cate.
you don't have any more experience than I do.
well, last time I checked, giving birth to her counts for something.
then you gave her up.
what-what does that count for?
let me be clear.
I'm not dropping out of that competition to make you happy.
you are the one keeping me from Lux.
you are the one with a douche fianc.
and you are the one coming here yelling at me.
so, the only way I am walking away from that contest is with the car.
good morning, Portland!
Hi, I am Cate Cassidy, and on behalf of K-100 and Massad Motors,
I would like to welcome you to the annual "Hands on a Hybrid" competition!
the rules are very simple: Ten-minute breaks every two hours.
no leaning on the car, no squatting down.
and you take your hand off for even oeven one second, you will be...disqualified.
you're really going through with this, huh?
how observant.
get ready to be even more of a loser.
now let's get your hands on a hybrid!
I can't believe you convinced me to wear this dress.
all I said was lose the black.
what if my mom laughs when she sees me in polka dots?
she's not going to laugh.
Tash, she's gonna be so happy to see you.
this is it? You sure?
told you.
she's a different person.
it worked out for me.
it can work out for you.
come on, Tash.
we should go.
yes?
Oh, my God.
mom. - Oh, my God, Natasha.
Oh, sweetheart.
hey there, Portland.
we are live at our "Hands on a Hybrid" competition.
we're four hours in, going strong, and, uh, yeah, not much has changed.
then again, what do you expect from a competition where people stand still for days?
but at least our crowd seems to be enjoying themselves.
am I right, people?
let's show 'em, Baze!
you chumps are going down in a Baze of glory! - Let's Baze it up!
and Ryan.
go, Ryan.
and let's check in with our defending champion.
how you feeling?
great, great.
prepared to stand here for days if that's what it takes.
all right, well, you keep it up, babe.
Yeah, the more days you're here, the less nights I have to hear you snore.
and then there's our other crowd favorite.
his name is Wang Zu, and he is rocking those black shades.
little poker face going on.
how are you feeling about your chances there, Wang?
wang?
excuse me. I'm sorry.
maybe he's blind.
he would still be able to hear, genius.
you're gonna have to interview me eventually.
I mean, that is, after Ryan drops out because he misses his hair products.
and it's break time.
we are back with Jeremy in the studio.
round one...
let's go.
good stuff, man.
Oh.
talk to me, buddy. What's wrong? - Oh, I don't know if I can win.
my dogs are barking.
Oh, you got to put those hobbit feet away.
okay, listen to me.
you are a bartender.
you stand for a living.
you're a professional stander.
you let yourself get beat by one of these weekend amateurs?
I don't know. Ryan looks pretty formidable.
he's got calves the size of hams.
I'm gonna scope the situation out.
how you feeling?
piece of cake.
can you, uh...?
Yeah, fifth hour's where people start dropping like flies.
Ah, well, thank you for being so cool about Baze you know, and not making an issue.
Yeah, I won't...unless he gets in my face.
what do you mean, gets in your face?
well, I can't stand the guy, but as long as he stays away from me, I'm fine.
all I'm saying is, it wouldn't hurt to use a little pumice every once in a while.
math is right about Ryan.
calves of steel, but he has a weak spot.
okay, his kryptonite: his Achilles' heel.
what is it?
you.
my suggestion?
you stand right next to him, get all up in his business.
he'll drop out just to get away from you.
all right, now, come on.
you can take this fool down.
you get out there.
you show 'em what you got. - Yeah.
and you come at me with pumice.
what happened?
wait. Tasha! - Leave me alone.
Tash, wait! Stop.
what did she do? What did...What did she say? - What do you think she said?
she said no.
What?!
she's worked hard to-to get sober, to-to rebuild her life.
she can't risk relapsing.
she has two new little kids.
they need her.
wh-what do you have to do with relapsing?
cause she says that I remind her of the past, of my dad.
of course, you do. You're her kid!
no, no, no. We have to go back there. I'll talk to her.
I'll convince her. - No, Lux, forget it, okay?
don't do anything.
you've done enough.
Ryan? Ry-man. The Ryanator.
what say we get to know each other a little better?
let's not.
get a little up close and personal.
back off, dude. - What?
you can't take a little friendly competition?
Cate, I need to talk to you.
it's an emergency. - Why? What's wrong?
I want this car, so you might as well give up right now.
you're not even gonna make it through the night.
is that what you think?
well, for some reason, you don't strike me as the kind of guy who stands by something all the way to the end.
what was that supposed to mean?
well, let's see.
you got Cate pregnant in high school, and you denied you did it.
and then, 16 years later, you try and take advantage of her again, and again, you want to act like it didn't even happen.
what are you talking about?
the night Lux took off, and you and Cate went back to your bar.
I know what happened.
the thing is, if I don't find another way, then, she's gonna be gone.
look, man, I'm really sorry.
I didn't know she told you.
I mean, I can understand why you'd be pissed, but I didn't take advantage of anybody.
you know, blame the tequila, high school nostalgia, whatever, but it was pretty mutual.
it's not mutual when somebody pushes you away.
what do you mean, pushes you away? What-What are you talk...? Who pushed who away?
Cate pushed you away, you jackass, when you tried to kiss her.
come on, man, the night Lux went missing.
stop playing dumb. She told me.
like, three hours away gone.
I'll never be able to see her.
Yeah, you're right.
I tried to kiss her.
what can I say, Ryan?
I mean, you know, I had to...wonder.
did she get any better after 16 years?
Oh, my God, I can't believe he hit me in the nose.
Ryan, I am so sorry.
honestly, it meant nothing.
no, it meant less than nothing.
it was drunken and stupid, you know?
and I've never regretted anything more in my life.
if I could take it back, I would. - Wait. What?
I swear. Sleeping with Baze again - it was the biggest mistake of my life.
when did you sleep with Baze again?
okay, Ryan, just listen.
just give me a chance to explain everything.
when did this happen?
the night I told you he kissed me.
Oh. - No. We were...
you know, we were talking about Lux.
then we started talking about the winter formal, and it...
Cate, I asked you if you had slept with him, and you told me no.
Yeah, because I didn't want to hurt you.
you know, Ryan, you and I - we weren't together.
not together? I proposed!
Yeah, but we got in that fight on the dock and broke up, and I just thought that Lux was gonna be a deal-breaker for you, so...
no, don't put this on me.
I'm not. I am just saying that, you know, technically, you and I - we were not together.
I'm sorry. Are you seriously trying to argue that you didn't cheat on a technicality?
you said that love was understanding, being honest.
I am being honest. - Because you got caught!
do you get the difference?
okay, Ryan, where are you going?
I'm leaving. - No. Okay, I'll come with you.
let me just find somebody to cover for us. - Cate, I'm not just leaving the contest.
I'm leaving you. - No. Ryan, listen, listen. We can get through this.
listen, this is you and me.
just listen, please. - No. Cate, I've been listening.
I listened to you mock my proposal.
I listened to you give me my ring back.
I listened to you say you wanted to be a family with me and Lux.
I listened to you swear that there was nothing to worry about with Baze.
I am done listening.
I am done understanding.
I am done being the good guy. - No!
Ryan, no! no! - No, Cate, it is your turn to listen.
this relationship?
it's over.
no. Ryan? Ryan!
you okay?
no, not really.
Ryan - he just found out about...about everything.
that I slept with Baze again.
God, I'm sorry.
okay, I'm gonna get Scotty from DriveTime to cover for me.
let's go. I just...I cannot be here.
Cate, I-I know this isn't the best time.
I need a favor.
a - A big one.
and I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't incredibly important to me.
I need you to take Tasha.
Yeah, take her where?
no, I mean, take Tasha in to live with us.
with the extra stipend from the state, it wouldn't cost anything, and she and I can share thom.
wait, Lux, just...will you slow down, please?
just slow down. - There's just...There's just not a lot of time.
that's a really big decision.
if we don't do this now, they're gonna send her away to another crappy foster home far away from everything.
far away from me.
I don't know. ok. The timing of all of this right now...
yoand I - we're just starting to figure things out, and right now, with Ryan...I st...
this is just a lot.
I have never asked you for anything before.
you said that I uld come to you.
that you would be there and-and do anything to help.
well, this would help.
this would fix everything.
I've already lost Bug.
Tasha's the only friend that I have left.
so, please.
this is the only thing I'll ever ask you.
I swear.
the only thing.
please?
Lux, I can't.
not right now, not like this.
I...I'm sorry.
me, too.
I called Cate.
I told her you were gonna chill here tonight.
so, we're a mess, huh?
none of us getting what we really wanted.
you, Tasha.
me, the car.
you're really more of a truck guy.
I couldn't have pictured you, that, you know, low to the ground.
I didn't want to win the car for me.
I wanted to win it for you.
look, lately, it's just...
it just seems like it's you and Ryan and Cate.
this family.
I don't think that's gonna be an issue anymore.
it's not just that.
she can get you stuff that I can't.
she can buy you whatever you want.
and a few weeks ago, you were paying my rent.
and I just wanted something to give you.
something to show you that I...
you know.
you never need to get me anything.
I know.
it still would have been a cool dad move to give you your first car.
there is something I want way more.
it wouldn't cost anything.
thank you for, uh, coming on such short notice, Fern.
my pleasure. You said you wanted to discuss a custody issue?
Yeah, yeah.
uh, we've really cleaned up the place.
bong lamp's relocated; sheep's been put out to pasture;
smoke detectors have new batteries, and tomorrow I got a guy putting a railing on the roof deck.
it's quite an improvement from the last time.
Yeah, um, well, I know you have my paperwork from before, but I printed you an updated bank statement.
my bar has started turning a profit.
there's actually money in my account now, so that's better.
very good.
and over here...
this would be Tasha's room.
I'm sorry. I assumed you wanted to talk about custody of Lux.
no, no, it's Tasha we're worried about.
what you've done here, it's impressive.
but for you to take in Tasha is simply not possible.
a single man taking in a teenager who's not a blood relative, the courts would never approve it.
however, when we first met,
I told you that while Lux is still a ward of the state, if things improved,
I would consider you for joint physical custody of her.
I think that time is now.
what does that mean?
it means that you can now live here, too.
here and Cate's.
are you serious?
Mm-hmm, it's always preferable to grant custody to both parents, assuming that they're capable.
and given what I've seen, you certainly are.
what are you doing?
packing.
Baze is waiting for me outside.
fern just approved this morning for 50/50 custody.
what?
and since I've been living with you for the past month...
but when did you meet with Fern?
this morning.
I'm gonna chill at Baze's for a while.
Lux, I don't understand.
is this because of Tasha?
it's because of you.
you said that I could come to you for whatever I needed.
that you'd be there.
you weren't.
Baze...he was.
so, uh, you met with Fern to get custody?
is this your way of getting back at me for lying about you to Ryan?
it was for Tasha.
no, this is for you.
don't act like this isn't what you wanted this whole time.
to be with my kid?
Yeah, Cate, yeah, I did.
I'm sorry.
of course you want to be with Lux.
I do, too.
I'm getting what I deserve.
you don't deserve this, Cate.
Yeah, you screwed up with Ryan.
but so did I.
I mean, not with Ryan, with you.
things will...
they'll be okay.
nothing's permanent.
you know, maybe we could all use a little change.
I didn't want a change. I didn't want to lose him.
I don't want to lose her.
not now.
I know.
I know, and you won't.
I didn't even get to say good-bye.
you and someone had a kid, you gave up that kid.
I'm that kid.
Cate Cassidy, that's your mom.
I'm Cate Cassidy.
Ryan and I've been up since 5.
and as usual, arguing since six.
what are you doing?
will you marry me?
you've met the qualifications as foster parents and will be granted temporary joint custody of Lux.
sleeping with Baze again, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
when did you sleep with Baze again?
this relationship it's over.
no, Ryan.
that family wants me.
they're three hours away.
I need you to take Tasha.
to live with us.
Lux, I can't.
this is the only thing I'll ever ask you.
I'm sorry.
me, too.
Hey, you in here?
Seriously?
Lux, I can explain.
for once we're not talking about sex.
we are talking about sleeping together.
sleeping" being the operative word.
sometimes it can be incredibly romantic to share a bed with someone you love.
can" being the other operative word.
actual quality of sleep can be totally downgraded.
that's true; that's very true, but what about the guilt?
what guilt?
well, you know, every time you move, your partner views it as a personal assault on her REM state.
it's true.
but sometimes you just wish they'd disappear so you can have your bed back and rest in peace.
okay, so we have Nancy from Richmond on the line.
Nancy, why are you losing sleep?
my new boyfriend is a kicker.
Yeah, you remember that episode where Ozzie and Harriet have spontaneous morning sex?
no. - Exactly.
look, Cate, besides, if we sleep in separate beds you're not going to be able to rub your ice cube feet all over my legs.
I started wearing socks.
and maybe I don't have cold feet Maybe you have hot legs.
anyway, opped putting my feet on you a few weeks ago, in case you hadn't noticed.
Yeah, I noticed.
you know, the funny thing is, sometimes I wake up having dreamt that your feet are still on me when they're not.
you dream about my feet?
like once.
mm, last night was pretty mindblowing.
you're telling me.
I don't think I've ever had a foot cramp that seized my lower back before.
Hey, you want some breakfast?
I'm gonna make some for Lux.
I didn't see her when I went to get water.
Oh, just for five more minutes.
nice try.
it took me an hour to escape your vise grip.
what can I say?
I missed you.
the next time you leave town I am implanting a GPS chip in you.
I bet Baze would love to get a tracking system on you.
well, there are benefits to my bedroom walls being shower curtains.
he's too weirded out to open them.
he's also too busy sleeping with Cate's sister to notice anything.
so, what are you up to today?
I don't know.
being back means I've got to find a way to pay rent.
which means I got to get a job.
like a legit job?
I actually got a gig tonight.
Really?
Yeah, it's 50 bucks to pass out fliers at some cheesy nightclub.
it's lame, I know, but I want to do this for you.
no, it's not lame.
it's so not lame.
I'll come with you.
well, ifou're doing this for me, the least I can do is be there for you.
Hey, you.
I zapped up some tempehtofu dogs for you, but are they supposed to smell like a hippie's armpit?
cause they do.
so does Abby's patchouli perfume.
Ah, is that what this cold shoulder's all about?
you are sneaking around behind Cate's back with her sister, being a giant sex hypocrite.
you bribed a guy to date me, and waved a condom in his face that wasn't even his.
it's more than a cold shoulder.
it's.
a cold whole body.
okay, I know I made some mistakes.
I shouldn't have butted into your dating life for one.
I don't have a dating life.
I'm with Bug.
okay, about that I I don't think that guy's good for you.
he's a delinquent and a parasite.
remember when you weren't going to butt into my dating life?
fine, fine, consider my butt out of it.
I just.
just tell me what can I do to fix things between us?
stop seeing Abby.
fine.
whatever.
I'm, uh, I'm glad we had this talk.
hello.
Yes, this is she.
Yes, she's my daughter.
Oh, my God!
Yeah, I'll be right there.
a curfew violation?
what is this, wartime Germany?
the law is intended to ensure that parents know where their children are at all times.
and I'm guessing you didn't know Lux was distributing flyers outside a nightclub at 1: 00 A. M.
of course I didn't.
I thought Ferris Bueller here was at home in bed.
I was trying to help Bug with his job, which he lost because of me.
okay, what happened to no Bug?
I never agreed to anything.
it is your responsibility to keep track of her.
being as you share custody, it's just as much your responsibility.
unless you're saying you two are no longer sharing custody.
well, I'm just staying at Baze's for a bit.
Mmhmm, she's mad at me because of this little thing with her friend.
Tasha's not some "little thing.
if you would have taken her in, she wouldn't be three hours away living with a family that she hates.
so, you two had a fight, Lux moved outand you ft the change in custody arrangements?
and you're failing to set boundaries or keep tabs on Lux's whereabouts.
as you know, your family evaluation is scheduled for next month.
Yes, and this will all be straightened out by then, I promise.
Cate, from where I'm standing which is in a police station in the middle of the night this situation seems a little past straightening out.
I'm moving up your evaluation.
be in my office Monday, 9:00 A. M.
what exactly will you be evaluating?
she needs guardians she respects who can keep her under control.
what do you mean she needs guardians?
we're her parents.
this arrangement was temporary.
so, if you two can't control Lux, we need to find people who can.
Yes, we have problems, but, I mean, it's nothing that we can't work out.
I've been to these evaluations plenty of times.
once it gets to this, the chances of staying together aren't that great.
this isn't going to be like other times, Lux.
unless.
do you want it to be?
well, I don't want to go back to foster care, if that's what you mean.
good.
so then things need to change.
exactly.
but how do we fix things before Monday?
well, forgiving me for Tasha, that would be a good start.
and maybe living by my rules?
you don't even live by your rules.
you guys say that I have to change for this evaluation.
well, what about the two of you?
cashier needs a high school diploma.
Busboy: Experience required.
Windowwasher: Must bring his own tools.
what, like a squeegee?
I'm never gonna get a job and my rent's due in a week.
no, you'll find something.
I know it.
how?
I don't have experience or education.
I don't even have a squeegee.
you have me.
don't tell Baze that.
dude hates me.
don't worry about Baze.
aren't you?
you worried about this evaluation thing or what?
kind of.
a lot.
I don't want to be taken away.
but I can't help feeling the way that I feel either.
Hi, I'm sorry to just show up here.
what are you doing here?
well, I know how upset you've been with me about Tasha.
and I know that I couldn't help her, but I thought maybe I could help you.
I know that you need a job and I've got one for you.
are you serious?
it's at the station.
and it's yours if you want it.
you know, it's logging tapes, answering phones.
you can interview later today.
are you sure?
I'm the star of the show. I've got pull.
so, let me get this straight. You don't have a resume?
uh, no, ma'am.
and you didn't graduate high school?
no, ma'am, but I plan on getting my GED.
as soon as I get a job.
kind of a catch 2-2 there.
so.
this is the extent of your experience.
uh, no.
I've had other jobs.
you know, here and there.
but I learn quick.
okay, Bobby.
thank you for coming in.
Thanks. - okay take care
okay, so he's no perfect.
he's polite.
I hate being called "ma'am.
I will have him call you "mister.
come on, Alice.
look, even if I wanted to hire him, which I don't, the company doesn't let us hire people without a high school diploma.
come on.
the show is called Morning Madness with Cate and Ryan.
I'm Cate.
doesn't that mean anything?
lately, no.
all right, come on. Look, Alice, please?
I have already tanked things with Ryan.
I just need. - The Ryan problem would be easier to deal with.
the man admitted that he still dreams about your feet.
barely
whatever. It means he still feels something.
it doesn't mean he wants me back.
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
I practically begged him at that stupid contest not to do this.
I made it completely obvious at the dumb Expo that want to be with him.
Ryan doesn't want to get back together with me unless I change, but look at me.
look at my life. Here I am, trying to get my daughter's boyfriend named Bug a job.
how much more can I change?
Yeah, about that.
should I tell you now or later that the job thing is not going to happen?
listen to me, Alice.
I will do anything.
I cannot let her down again.
Cate, I'm sorry.
what happened to "It's yours if you want it"?
I know and I feel terrible.
it's okay.
you tried.
I'm sorry if I got your hopes up.
if you got his hopes up?
you said to trust you, that the job was his.
Lux, I am sorry.
I'm the one who's sorry.
for being stupid enough to believe you'd actually come through.
you wanted to talk to me?
Hey, Abby, yeah.
Yeah, thanks for coming down.
I, uh, I got deliveries.
Jamie's gone.
I couldn't leave.
but I want to talk to you.
um, about Lux.
Oh, yeah. I just heard. Cate told me.
what?
wait, you didn't talk to Cate about us, did you?
are you crazy?
she'd inflict worse damage than a shark attack.
speaking of which, uh.
I want to talk about that.
you wanna - Ooh, um, yeah.
um, I meant "sit.
take it from me.
this evaluation isn't going to be easy.
social workers are a tough.
they're bitter parakeetowning feministas.
and if you and Lux are having trouble, she'll know.
I picked her up from a police station.
I think that "troubles" is putting it mildly.
well, if it makes you feel any better, Cate's not having any luckther.
she just tried to hire Bug to make Lux happy, and it just blew up in her face.
you want to hire Bug?
sure.
the bar's getting busy.
I've been shorthanded.
it'd be a favor to me.
I mean, it's late hours and it's hard work, but if you're up for it.
hell, yeah, I'll take the job.
when do I start? - How about now?
uh, grab some limesout of the s.
it's downstairs. You'll find it.
why are you doing this?
he's a good kid.
Really?
cause yesterday, you called him a delinquent parasite.
okay, look You and I didn't get off on the right foot with this whole parenting thing.
but if Bug is important to you, then he's important to me.
what's the catch?
no catch.
but in order for this to work with me and Bug, it's got to work between you and me.
you got to play by the rules.
so no sleeping at Bug's, no sneaking out.
so that when we meet with Fern, she won't be able to ding us on anything.
we'll be cool, right?
Yeah.
we're cool.
Hey, Bug.
when you're done here, can you refill the soda canisters?
I did it already.
that's great.
you can start tidying up the bar supplies.
already done.
you overachieve much?
I just want to do a good job, you know?
I just really appreciate this chance, Baze.
so, thanks.
Yeah.
Oh, crap.
I forgot that you were here.
that's okay.
I was just waiting to talk.
although, you know, it would be fun to go someplace and not talk.
believe me, I would love to, multiple times, but I can't.
I can't do this.
this.
fling, or whatever it is.
because I'm not being a good example for Lux.
so I can't see you anymore, Abby.
are you okay?
No!
no.
you are such a great guy that you're making my ovaries hurt.
Hello?
I need your help as a therapist.
narcissistic borderline personality disorder.
that's what you have.
I meant with Lux.
she won't listen to a word I say because of this Tasha thing.
I thought it was a Bug thing.
Yeah, whatever. I'm on a roll.
I mean, do you think you can help me?
because I got to fix things by Monday.
whatever you need.
Oh, great.
uh, meet me at Baze's above Open Bar.
that's where she is. Do you need the address?
you know, I think I can find it.
you can relax with the death stare.
nobody's forcing you to be here.
good.
cause Bug's in the bar.
what's Bug doing in the bar?
Baze hired him.
that's what.
are you serious?
you seem to have a lot of anger and hostility towards Cate.
and frankly, who can blame you?
but you need to understand where Cate was coming from with this whole Tasha thing.
this Fern chick barely thinks that she's capable of keeping you.
you think that she would have let Cate have Tasha?
that's not the point.
the point is, is that I asked you and you wouldn't even try.
okay, well, then what are the rules, Lux?
because I tried with Bug.
I tried to hire him before Baze did.
yet, somehow he's the hero and I suck.
can we be done now?
I can't believe I'm going to say this.
but for once, you're not the problem here.
this is not about Tasha or Bug.
honestly.
this is about Lux.
uh, long time no see.
Yeah.
it's been, what, since dinner at your parents', I think.
I definitely have not seen you since then.
didn't she helyou with the sex talk?
Lux?
that's right.
that's, um, it was awkward.
blocked that out.
you hired Bug. That's what's up.
that was my way of fixing things and.
so what?
so what?
now you're rubbing it in my face?
I'm not rubbing anything.
you tried, I tried.
that's the point, right?
I mean, who cares who helps Bug?
who even cares about Bug?
guys.
just came to see if you needed help Who even cares?
bug, wait. wait Bug?
what is the matter with you?
Cate screws him over and you stomp on whatever selfworth he had left?
listen, Cate and I, we just want to make things right.
we cannot fail this evaluation.
don't you get it?
neither of you cAn make it right.
the most consistent thing you two do is make things worse.
okay, here's the deal.
we just have to go in there and present a united front.
we want Lux, and she wants us.
what if that doesn't work?
okay. Well, then we only have one choice.
lie.
so, last I saw you, things were a bit out of control.
how have the past few days been?
good, good.
uh, yeah, we're just smoothing out the kinks.
what kind of kinks?
have you met Bug?
last night, Baze helped me with my homework.
who knew he was so adept at fractions?
last night, I took Lux to see a stage play.
of Billy Elliott.
I thought it had an uplifting theme.
lots of dancing.
last night, we partied on Rock Band for hours.
I mean, up until her bed time which is a strictly enforced hard 10: 00.
no snacking after 9: 00.
do you.
do you Rock Band?
so, you think things are working great as they are?
without question.
hells to the yeah.
Mmhmm.
in all of my years of social work, I have never seen such a pathetic charade.
you would rather lie about your problems than confront or solve them.
and if that's the case, I have no other choice but to find Lux another placement.
it was my fault.
and what is the truth?
in short.
we suck.
but not for lack of trying.
I don't know if this is about Tasha or not anymore.
but I tried to make it up to you with Bug. I did
Tasha and Bug aren't like other kids.
they don't have parents to support them.
when they need help, they turn to me.
and you made me feel likE I could turn to you, but you weren't there for me.
for you?
you mean for your friends.
Yeah, my friends.
but you said "me.
you said Cate wasn't there for you.
Yeah, she wasn't.
I asked her the favor.
so yeah, she wasn't there for me.
that's what this is really about, right?
Cate not being there.
I say yes and what?
you send me away to live with someone else?
I don't want to live with someone else.
I want to work it out with Cate and Baze.
I just.
look, I'm the one who's going to decide if you stay together.
but ultimately, it's not up to me.
it's up to you.
if you can't be straight with me, you're never gonna be straight with Cate and Baze and then you'll be right back on my couch six months from now.
so when you say that Cate wasn't there for you, tell her what you mean.
where were you?
what?
I was out there my whole life.
where were you all that time?
you never even checked.
you never wondered what had happened?
if I was okay?
I didn't really think that I had to worry.
you know, because they told me that you were gonna be adopted.
that you were gonna have a better life.
I really, I really thought that I was doing what was right for you.
it wasn't for me.
if it was for me, you would have checked.
no, you did it for you. You did the right thing for you.
Lux, it's not all on Cate.
I wasn't there exactly, either.
Yeah, but you didn't know.
and no one who knew you would have expected you to be there.
I was 16 years old.
I didn't have anyone to turn to.
you know, my mother, she was drinking her way through another divorce.
I had no idea what a good parent was.
there was just no way that I could be one, not at 16.
then what about a few years after that?
when I was three and stuck in a hospital where no one visited?
or two years after that when my foster mom shoved me into a wall and told the social worker that I fell off a swing.
where were you?
we used to make up these stories about why we were given up.
but you did.
you gave me away to nothing, like I didn't matter to you because I didn't.
no, no, Lux, you do.
you matter now.
no, Lux, you matter, you do, you matter now, Lux.
no, now it doesn't count.
I'm sorry.
I don't forgive you, Cate.
I don't.
I know it doesn't feel like it, but what you had today was a breakthrough.
trust me, I've seen other kids have moments of honesty like this, and that's usually when things take turn for the better.
I know that you tried to shoulder the blame, but it doesn't belong with you.
I'm not going to remove Lux from your care.
if anything, this shows me that you're a real family, with all the bumps and bruises that a teenager brings, like anyone.
and as far as I'm concerned, you two would start the process of having your parental rights reinstated.
Really?
is there really a chance of that In my opinion, yes.
that was a hard thing she did, saying that.
she risked losing you all over again.
she never has to worry about that.
ever.
you don't have to convince me.
convince Lux.
Lux, you there?
can we talk?
I'm gonna put an envelope under the door. just take a look, okay?
what's wrong?
I need your help.
you know, Lux says that she can't forgive me for giving her up.
and I can't really get through.
neither can Baze.
you can't keep coming to me like this.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
I know it's not fair.
well, can I at least just tell you something?
I never told anyone this before.
I never held Lux after she was born.
you know, the nurses, they wanted me to.
they kept bringing her in to me, but.
I knew that if I held hEr, I'd want her.
and I couldn't let myself.
so I pushed her away.
and I have done that my entire life.
with everyone.
until recently.
I mean, Ryan, I know that you say that I have to change, but what you don't realize is that I have changed.
I mean, I started to change the moment that Lux came back into my life, because for the first time in my life, I saw a possibility.
you know, for the rst time in my life I saw.
I saw a dream that I wasn't afraid to want.
and I'm not saying that I changed overnight, it has been slow, and I have made a lot of mistakes.
I know that I lied to yo.
I know that that was wrong.
it was beyond wrong.
but at the time, I thought I had to or I would lose you.
and it wasn't just about losing you.
it was about losing the person that I was becoming with you.
and Lux.
I wanted to be a family.
you know, but so much has happened.
I don't expect you to understand or forgive me.
but will you at least just help me?
Lux isn't here.
she went for a walk.
on a scale of one to ten, how pissed is Lux at me?
can you blame her?
in case you can't tell, I'm often in a race with myself for jackass of the year.
well, you won. Congratulations.
listen.
I'm sorry.
what you heard, I just.
okay, you're probably not gonna believe a word I say, but.
I see a lot of potential in you.
you're a lot like me, minus the whole neck situation.
so, I might have hired you for the wrong reasons, but I'd like to keep you on for the right ones.
so.
job's still yours.
if you want it.
just think about it.
I thoughtI'd find you here.
this your thinking spot?
guess I've had a lot of thinking to do lately.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
whatcha got there? - Court papers.
Cate and Baze signed them.
to legally adopt me.
when I'm ready.
but you're not?
why not?'Cause I think it's more than just not forgiving Cate.
you and Cate are so much alike. It's crazy.
you're both scared to really want tngs.
scared if you do, it'll hurt too much if you don't get them, or they disappear.
Cate's not going anywhere.
and these court papers prove it.
she's changed, Lux, and you're the one who changed her.
you don't really believe that.
Yeah, I do.
then I don't get it.
you come here and find me to tell me that, that Cate's changed, that I should give her another chance.
but if you really believe that that's true, then why can't you?
can I talk to you?
of course.
wrap up. It's cold.
so, I've been doing some thinking.
you, me, this.
yeah?
before I moved in, we had churro contests and YouTube marathons.
the ketchupeating competition.
Ah, that wasn't really a contest.
math is a human siphon.
but lately it's been less ketchupeating and more fighting, and I don't like it.
I don't want to fight with you.
Yeah, and I don't either.
I want to go back.
all this trying to beadad stuff has gotten in the way.
I want to go back to being just friends.
it doesn't work like that.
I can't just flip a switch and go back.
you could be my friend, it's fine, but I am never going to stop trying to be your dad.
I'm, I'm sorry to bother you so late.
I just.
I don't know.
I need someone to talk to.
what's wrong?
my own kid just broke up with me.
this is just the beginning.
you think it happens overnight?
people spend their entire lives learning to be parents and they still screw their kids up.
I mean, look at me.
I'm a therapist who still lives with my mom.
Ouch.
do you want to come inside?
she and her box of wine are already in bed.
I probably shouldn't.
I mean, you and me, it's probably not a good idea, gaven everything.
Baze, this doesn't have to be just a fling.
crazy idea, but maybe if you show Lux that it's more, she'll see it differently.
you should be a therapist or something.
you give really good advice.
well, that'll be a hundred bucks.
how about, um. we go out tomorrow?
dinner, maybe.
I mean, you do, you like dinner, right?
what's not to like?
it's gonna work out with Lux.
you'll see.
come in!
I was just thinking about you.
yeah?
Yeah, well, I mean, I was thinking about your hot legs and my cold feet.
why is it so hard to keep a pair of socks together?
the missing one usually turns up.
sometimes it just takes someone else to find it.
here's the thing: I can't promise that this is gonna work or that I won't get upset and I won't take it out on you.
I know I seem like I'm okay, but I'm more messed up inside than you realize.
and the truth is, I don't forgive you.
I don't know when I'll ever be able to forgive you.
Lux, you don't have to.
you don't ever have to forgive me.
I'm never gonna be able to forgive me.
I just want a chance to make it right with you.
please tell me whaI have to do to make it right.
let me come home.
I, uh, restocked the liquor and polished off the last of the peanuts.
I was starving. I wasn't sure how to order more.
I could. I could show you if you want.
Hey, um, Lux said something about your dad.
he in the picture?
unless the picture's prison, no.
make you a deal.
since you don't have a dad and I need to learn how to be one, uh, maybe you can give me some practice.
well? - well, she's unpacking.
I can't believe it.
I never thought I'd be so happy to see a bong lamp.
how'd you do it? What'd you say?
the truth.
and I know that earlier, you, uh, you did, too.
look, II don't like being lied to and I don't like being played.
I know, Ryan, I know.
I mean it would be hard for anyone to put themselves in your shoes that day, the day Lux came back.
that day was. it was lifechanging.
and where you and I were or weren't, it's not an excuse for what you did.
I'm just saying.
I wasn't in your shoes.
and you were right you were changing.
you didn't lie because you hadn't changed.
you lied because you had.
I just want to do the right thing, you know?
take my own advice.
I want to be able to forgive you, Cate.
and I want to be there for Lux.
I know, but you can't.
Ryan, I only wanted to be a person that's worthy of you.
I still do, whether or not we're together.
I can'ank you enough for everythivg.
kicking me out now or what?
no, of course not.
cause I could stay.
Really?
come here.
your mom, too.

witnesses at the scene say...
...that Diego spat in the face of a fan who asked for an autograph.
he was killed in the ensuing brawl. The fan was later beaten to death...
coffee, please. Black.
...By the angry crowd.
born in 2009, the son of Marcello and Sylvia Ricardo, a working-class couple from Mendoza, he struggled all his life with the celebrity status thrust upon him as the world's youngest person.
Diego Ricardo, the youngest person on the planet was 18 years, 4 months, 20 days, 16 hours and 8 minutes old.
man ON TV: Throughout his life, Diego Ricardo was a tragic reminder of the 18 years of infertility that humanity has endured and its effect upon the world we now live in.
it seems that the mantle of the world's youngest human has passed to a woman.
she is 18 years, 5 months and 11 days old.
Faron. - Mr Griffiths.
I seem to be more affected by Baby Diego's death than I realised, sir.

I'll bet it was the government.
every time one of our politicians is in trouble, a bomb explodes.
it's the second time in a month.
you okay? - It was horrible.
I'm glad you don't take cream or sugar, amigo.
losing you and Baby Diego on the same day would be too hard to bear.
well, that was even worse, everybody crying.
I mean, Baby Diego, come on. That guy was a wanker.
Yeah, but he was the youngest wanker on Earth.
pull my finger. Quick, quick!
Jasper...
fucking hell! That's disgusting!
illegal immigrants. Taking them to Bexhill.
poor fugees.
after escaping the worst atrocities and finally making it to England, our government hunts them down like cockroaches.
any girls? - No.
what about the one we had lunch with? Lauren?
Lorna. That was ages ago.
I liked her. What happened? - She decided to renounce.
Renouncers? Are those the ones that kneel down for a month for salvation?
no. They're the Repenters.
the Renouncers flagellate themselves for the forgiveness of humanity.
Oh, right.
dating ain't what it used to be, is it, amigo?
Jasper: What'd you do on your birthday? THEO: Nothing.
come on. You must've done something.
no. Same as every other day.
woke up, felt like shit, went to work, felt like shit.
that's called a hangover, amigo.
at least with a hangover, I feel something.
honestly, Jasper, sometimes...
you could always come and live with us.
Yeah, but if I did that, I wouldn't have anything to look forward to.
Jasper: Look who it is. It's Theo.
THEO: Hey, Janice, how you doing? - It's Theo.
your rebel with a lost cause.
she loves this colour.
don't you, darling? You love it.
is there a chance it will not work for me?
there have been no cases of anyone surviving "who has taken the preparation.
daddy government hands out suicide kits and anti-depressants in the rations, but ganja is still illegal.
most of my weed goes to Bexhill now.
this bloke buys it from me and smuggles it in.
guess what he does? His real job?
lmmigration cop.
Bravo!
one of the many perks of having a refugee camp in the neighbourhood.
come on, taste that.
cough.
cough? - Cough.
you taste it? Strawberries.
this is Strawberry Cough.
so, Human Project is having this dinner and all the wisest men in the world are there...
human Project." Why do people believe this crap?
you know, even if these people existed with these facilities in secret locations...
fuck me, that's strong.
even if they discovered the cure for infertility, it doesn't matter.
too late. The world went to shit.
you know what?
it was too late before the infertility thing happened, for fuck's sake.
I was just trying to tell a joke, man.
I'm sorry. Go on.
no, I'm not telling it now. - No, come on, Jasper.
no. Fuck it. I'm not fucking telling you. - It's all right. Go on.
okay. The Human Project gives this great big dinner for all the scientists and sages in the world.
they're tossing around theories about the ultimate mystery, why are women infertile? Why can't we make babies anymore?
some of them say it's genetic experiments, gamma rays, pollution. Same old, same old.
anyway, in the corner, this Englishmars sitting.
he hasn't said a word. He's just tucking into his dinner.
so they decide to ask him.
they say, "Well, why do you think we can't make babies anymore"?
and he looks up at them, and he's chewing on this great big wing, and he says, "I haven't the faintest idea," he said.
but this stork is quite tasty, isn't it?
eating a fucking stork.
eating the stork.
italia.
you okay, amigo?
Yeah. My ears are still ringing from earlier.
well, a little Zen music won't bother you, then, will it?
woman ON TV: Good morning. The time is 7: 59 a. m.
woman ON PA: British citizens, hold out your I. D. Cards. All others, follow instructions.
what the fuck?
move along! Move along!
PATRIC: This is him.
get your fucking head down! - Walk!
get your fucking head down! - THEO: Okay. Okay.
ZARA: Get in! LUKE: Get him in! Get him in!
get his fucking legs.
PATRIC: Go, go, go, go!
Ian: You are under the jurisdiction of the Fishes.
the Fishes are at war with the British government until they recognise equal rights for every immigrant in Britain.
Luke: We're not gonna hurt you. We just want to talk.
PATRIC: But don't do anything stupid.
JULIAN: Uncover him. IAN: It isn't safe.
PATRIC: Do it.
Hello, Theo.
it's me, Theo. It's Julian.
you scared the shit out of me.
I'm sorry about the theatrics, but we had no choice.
the police have been a pain in the ass lately.
how have you been?
fantastic. Couldn't be better.
cut the lights.
the police keep using that old photo of you in the posters.
it doesn't do you justice.
what do the police know about justice?
what exactly is it you guys do, anyway?
PATRIC: The Fishes fight for equal rights for every immigrant in Britain!
Luke: He knows what we do.
I know you almost blew me up in a coffee shop yesterday.
my ears are still ringing.
we don't bomb. - That was the government.
that's what they do to spread the fear.
what about Liverpool?
JULIAN: After Liverpool, we stopped bombing.
we started speaking to the people.
and they're joining us, Theo. British people, too.
I don't talk politics.
that's all you ever used to do. - That was 20 years ago.
I'm a lot more successful now.
come on, Theo. Walk with me.
Ian: I don't think that's a good idea. - Come on!
you're smoking? - Yeah. It's not working.
I heard about your mother. I'm sorry.
were your parents in New York when it happened?
Yeah. - Shit.
Yeah, well, that's the world we live in now, isn't it?
why am I here, Jules?
I need your help. I need transit papers.
not for me. A girl, she's a fugee.
need to get her to the coast, past security checkpoints.
I haven't seen you for nearly 20 years and you come asking me for transit papers?
can you do it? - I don't see how.
you could ask your cousin.
the government finances his Ark of the Arts. He has access to papers.
Yeah, but he'd never do it. - He would if you asked him.
I can't. It's too dangerous.
I can get you $5, 000. I know you need the money.
what are you talking about?
I don't fucking need your money. - Right. Sorry.
my mistake.
you know that ringing in your ears? That...
that's the sound of the ear cells dying. Like their swan song.
once it's gone, you'll never hear that frequency again.
enjoy it while it lasts.
this never fucking happened, so don't go telling tales, cause we'll be watching you.
at work, when you sleep, when you have a piss, we'll be watching. All the fucking time.
jeez, your breath stinks.
no, it doesn't. - Yes, it does.
it was Juliars idea bringing you here. She put herself at great risk.
now you know about the five grand we can offer you.
so if you change your mind, pin this to the notice board at Camden tube. We'll do the rest.
here you are. Bus fare.
man ON LOUDSPEAKER: Earthquakes! Pollution!
disease and famine!
our sins have encouraged God's wrath!
and in his anger he has taken away his most precious gift to us!
mr Faron, the minister is expecting you. This way, sir.
I'm afraid this is a non-smoking facility.
you got something in your teeth.
if you'll excuse me.
couldn't save Pieta. Smashed up before we got there.
pretty rummy, huh?
my mom had a plastic one in the bathroom.
it was a lamp.
good to see you, Theo.
NIGEL: We got to keep Las Meninas and a few other Velasquezes, but we only got a hold of two Goyas. That thing in Madrid was a real blow to art.
THEO: Not to mention people.
how's Martha?
she's doing her animal charity thing. Sends her love.
give her my best. - Yes.
why did you come, Theo?
well, the thing is,
I met this girl.
cute?
beautiful.
is it serious?
very.
she's got this brother in Brighton and she hasn't seen him for about five years, and he's not doing too good.
I mean, pretty sick.
I don't think he's gonna make it. - Sorry.
I've got money. I was just hoping that you might...
I was hoping you could get us the transit papers to get to the coast.
transit papers? That's quite a favour. - I know.
highly controlled.
Alex, take your pills.
Alex.
Alex?
Alex!
come with me.
I'm really sorry, Nigel. I just don't know who else to ask.
I'll see what I can do.
what?
you kill me.
a hundred years from now, there won't be one sad fuck to look at any of this.
what keeps you going?
you know what it is, Theo?
I just don't think about it.
THEO: Where's Julian? LUKE: She couldn't make it. Sends her best.
here's a photo of the girl and her name.
hang on. We got a problem.
all I could get were joint transit papers, which means I would have to escort the girl.
will you?
for a couple more grand.
Julian thinks very highly of you.
does she?
Yeah.
thanks again.
go on, stay with her.
stay with her. Stay with her. Yes!
have you seen this dog?
I'll be one minute.
Billy! I'm in a rush, mate.
man: Okay, Theo. He'll see to you. He'll see to you.
I'm in a rush. Come on. Come on.
that's 70 quid.
shit.
woman ON TV 1: She's my house cleaner. MAN ON TV 1: He's the plumber.
man ON TV 2: He's my dentist. WOMAN ON TV 2: He's the waiter.
woman ON TV 3: She's my cousin.
announcer ON TV: They are illegal immigrants.
to hire, feed or shelter illegal immigrants is a crime.
protect Britain.
report all illegal immigrants.
did you get the papers?
lovely to see you, too.
thank you. I really appreciate this.
just like the old days, back of the bus.
Yeah, except we're the old farts now.
you're looking good. - Right.
seriously. Look at me.
it's hard for me to look at you.
he had your eyes.
you know, I never understood how you got over it so quickly.
you think I got over it?
no one could get over it. I live with it. I think about him every day.
come on, I mean the way you just...
you don't have a monopoly on suffering, you know.
you always carried his memory like a ball and chain...
what do you fucking know about my memories?
you don't know what I feel or what... - Move!
Yeah, there you go.
that's what you always do. When it gets tough, you walk away.
this is our stop.
so why did you come to me?
you could have found other ways to get transit papers.
probably.
so why me? - I trust you.
and what happens after? - You take a train back. It'll be safer.
no, I mean what happens to us?
I don't know.
Theo, come on. You came for the money.
did I?
Luke: Theo?
you got my money? - See?
we'll take you down to the first checkpoint on the Canterbury Road, then you and Kee are on your own.
well, this is obviously the elite unit.
this is Miriam. - Hi.
is this the girl? - JULIAN: Kee, this is Theo.
what the fuck you staring at?
apparently the pleasure's all mine.
are we planning a sing-along?
good. I'm gonna take a nap.
man ON RADIO: The afternoon is looking good here on Radio Avalon.
and now one for all the nostalgics out there, a blast from the past all the way back from 2003.
that beautiful time when people refused to accept the future was just around the corner.
you're snoring.
no, I wasn't. - Yes, you were. He always snored.
where are we?
Canterbury. We're close.
anyone know if there's a hotel around here?
what?
Julian promised me a little bit of action.
you still like it in the afternoon?
so what did you do? Rob a train? Blow up a building?
leave the girl alone.
you told me he was suave. Wanker's a drunk.
he's suave. You should have seen him in the old days when he was a real activist.
you were the activist, I just wanted to get laid.
one time the police came to throw us out of our squat and Theo invited them up for coffee to negotiate, only the coffee was spiked with ketamine.
No! You didn't, did you?
fuck off. You gotta be kidding.
you know how many people I've tried this with?
I don't wanna know.
you'll be happy to know out of the hundreds...
hundreds? ...you are still the only one.
I'm not doing it. - Yes, you are.
no, I'm not. The car's moving too much. - Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
you are. Ready?
no, wait, wait. Okay.
KEE: Do it again! Do it again!
Julian, that's disgusting!
look out!
Luke: Jesus! Shit!
JULIAN: Go! Go! We're gonna make it. Come on, we're gonna make it.
no, I'm not gonna make it! I'm not gonna make it!
Christ! - Back up! Back up now!
Jesus!
Oh, save us! Save us in our hour of need!
blessed Mary, save us.
Christ, Jesus!
he's got a gun! - Cover Kee!
get down!
Oh, my God!
she's been shot! Fuck. She's been shot.
how is she? How is she? - THEO: She's bleeding!
she's bleeding, she's bleeding everywhere!
shit! Julian.
put pressure on the wound!
Luke: Oh, no.
THEO: Julian...
Jesus Christ!
THEO: Julian!
Luke: It's the cops. It's the cops.
did they see us?
keep going. Speed up.
Luke: Are they coming back? What's happening?
faster! Faster!
are they coming back? - I don't know. Just go faster!
can't you pull off the road?
all right, slow down. Slow down! - I can't outrun them. I can't outrun them.
cop ON LOUDSPEAKER: Stop the car. - I gotta stop. I gotta stop.
pull over to the side of the road. Stop the car!
get your passports out!
cop: Stay inside the vehicle!
Luke: We're British citizens! We're British citizens!
british citizens! - Hands on the steering wheel!
hands on the steering wheel! Calm down. Tell me what happened!
we were attacked! We gotta take her to a hospital.
okay. Just wait. I'm gonna call for assistance.
what are you doing? What are you doing?
get in the car. - Why did you do that?
get in the fucking car!
MIRIAM: Get back in now. Quickly. We gotta get off the road. Get in. Get in.
KEE: Go! Go! Go!
we have to call on help now. Put your hands out.
fucking shit.
may all the ascended beings, the bodhisattvas and saints and all those who have walked the surface of the earth in the light of eternal truth, come to the aid of our beloved sister, Julian.
Luke: Theo! Come on!
Theo, come on!
this is Tomasz and Emily's farm. I already called and told them the situation.
we'll be safe here.
fishes are coming in to vote for a new leader.
LAN? - Yeah.
we have to convene. - Everyone's arriving.
are you all right? - Yeah, it's not my blood.
Emily, Tomasz, this is Kee. - Welcome.
Miriam.
they need to wash up and rest.
how about Juliars mate?
Yeah, can somebody give me a lift back to London?
no, no, no. It's too dangerous. We'll sort it tomorrow.
Tomasz, get him a shower and a clean shirt.
Tomasz, don't block the car in. It needs to be jump-started. Lan?
Yeah.
they like you. And they don't like anyone.
CAROLINE: You did what you could. LUKE: We need to show strength and unity.
the shirt fit? - Yeah, it's fine. Thanks.
I'll take care of this.
as head Fishes, we need to make a choice now.
we need to choose leadership.
TOMASZ: I don't think that those bloodstains will wash off.
don't worry about it. Throw it away.
I'm in charge of watching you. - Why?
they told me.
well, I'm going back to London tomorrow.
I lived there once. Didn't like it.
no.
they kill you.
where you from? - Poland.
is this your place?
my missus. She's a cod.
english Fish. - MIRIAM: Mr Faron.
kee would like a word with you. She's in the barn. It's all right, Tomasz.
I'll watch him.
TOMASZ: Hey, don't smoke in the barn.
Emily: To Luke, our new leader. Luke.
to Luke. - Luke.
I'll be right outside.
KEE: You know what they do to these cows? They cut off their tits. They do.
gone. Bye.
only leave four. Four tits fits the machine.
it's wacko. Why not make machines that suck eight titties?
is that what you want to talk about? Cows and titties?
Julian told me about your baby.
said his name was Dylan.
you taught him to swim when he was two. He called you "Papa.
she said if anything goes spooky, I should talk to you.
said you'd help me, said you'd get me to the boat.
what boat? - The Tomorrow.
the Tomorrow?
I don't know what you're talking about.
but I'm sure your friends can take care of you.
but Julian said only trust you.
she said you'd help me.
I don't know why she said that.
listen, I don't quite know what's going on.
you can't leave. - Kee, I'm in a lot of trouble myself.
I'm sorry. - Wait!
what are you doing? Don't do that.
I'm scared.
please help me.
Jesus Christ.
Luke: Kee! Kee! MIRIAM: What are you doing?
are you all right? - She wanted him to know. She has the right.
of course she has.
for God's sake.
when you're ready, come inside. Everybody's arrived.
she's pregnant. - Now you know what's at stake.
but she's pregnant. - Yeah, I know.
it's a miracle, isn't it?
fishes terrorist leader Julian Taylor was killed today in a gun battle with police near Canterbury.
four other terrorists escaped after murdering two officers.
police say they have sufficient forensic and surveillance evidence to identify the four killers.
all suspects should be considered armed and extremely dangerous.
this was broadcast an hour ago.
we have to assume it's just a matter of time before they identify the rest of us, which includes you, Theo.
woman: Why is he here? MAN: He's not a Fish.
he's not one of us. - KEE: I want him here.
Luke: Kee wants him, he stays.
now, we all agreed to deliver Kee to our brothers and sisters in the Human Project.
all: Right. - Now we got to reevaluate that position.
no, there's no need. We move forward with the original plan.
Yes!
she'll never make it. The police are looking for her.
we can find a way. It's what Julian wanted.
we'd be risking the girl's life.
listen, listen! She belongs here.
and this baby is the flag that could unite us all!
MIRIAM: We said we'd never use this baby for political purposes.
KEE: My baby's not a flag.
make it public!
woman: What?
what? - What?
excuse me?
you should make it public.
you saw the telly. She's about to be very public.
THEO: It doesn't matter. She's pregnant.
Oh, right. And then the government will say, "We were wrong. Fugees are humans, too.
well, whatever is going on, whatever your political ideas are, it's irrelevant.
it doesn't matter. - WOMAN: Come on.
she needs a doctor. - MAN: You really don't get it.
woman 2: Look, the government will take her baby and parade a posh black English lady as the mother.
and she'll never see it again. - KEE: Nobody's taking my baby!
we all know this government would never acknowledge the first human birth in 18 years from a fugee.
a wanted fugee.
why don't we explain to Mr Faron what they do to immigrants in this country?
MIRIAM: He knows. He's seen the cages. He's not that stupid.
KEE: I'm not going to the government.
you told me you would get me to the Human Project.
you promised me. - I know.
and we will.
but I don't think it's safe to try and reach the coast now.
you could stay here, Kee. It's a safe place for you to have your child.
and when you and the baby are well enough, we will find a way to get you to the Human Project.
I promise you, Kee.
it could take months to get back in touch with them again.
this is true. We have to take it under consideration.
Kee, this is your decision.
what do you think?
I think you need proper care. - EMILY: Oh, brilliant!
she has proper care!
what the fuck does he know? - Hang on. Kee?
Kee, this is your choice.
I have my baby here... - Yes!
...then you get me to the Human Project.
thank you, Kee. Thank you.
Luke: We need to organise safe houses. No more than three days in one place.
MIRIAM: No, no, you can't keep moving her around.
Luke: It's for her safety.
PATRIC: Please help him! RADO: What are you doing?
he's hurt really badly! - Oh, shit, fuck.
I didn't have anywhere else to go. - You're not supposed to be here!
there's fucking police everywhere!
what do you think you're doing? - He's been bleeding for hours!
Luke: Shut up! Get his bike out of here. Get it out!
PATRIC: What was I supposed to do?
Luke: It's a simple fucking plan. Get in here, Patric!
what the fuck are you doing here? What the fuck are you doing here?
no fucking excuses!
Ian: You have a first aid kit? Medicine? TOMASZ: Mostly for cows.
iodine, bandages, clean towels, whatever you have, bring it to the barn.
and for God's sake, hide the fucking motorcycle.
Ian: You put everything at risk. PATRIC: What was I supposed to do?
what about all the fucking police, lan? You said it would be safe!
Ian: We paid the gang. We had no idea about the cops.
you broke the protocol. What were you thinking?
what was I thinking?
you could be responsible for putting the Uprising in jeopardy.
he needs a proper doctor!
don't you get it?
we have a baby.
when people see we have a baby, everyone will join us in the Uprising.
but we can forget about the baby if the girl even suspects we killed Julian!
what was I supposed to do?
you saw how he is. He's on death's fucking door!
Luke: Take it easy. - You broke protocol.
he's my fucking cousin!
Luke, he needs a doctor.
don't worry. We'll take care of him. Simon, right?
aye, Simon. - All right, sit down, Patric.
Simon is a good Fish. So are you.
be proud to know that because of the two of you, the Uprising is assured.
the baby will stay with us.
Where's Faron? He's a fucking dead man.
no. Tomorrow. We'll do him then, after we move the girl.
Patric, you ever break protocol again,
I'll have to kill you.
Kee. Kee, it's Theo.
listen to me. - KEE: What's going on?
Luke killed Julian. They want your baby. They killed Julian.
they're gonna... They killed Julian. They're gonna kill me.
we have to leave. We have to go now.
Miriam, shut up!
trust me, we've got to go.
stop it! Stop it! Both of you!
get off!
I'm going with him. Miriam, you can stay if you want.
Miriam, you have to keep your mouth shut.
I mean it. - All right. All right.
Luke: We're moving the girl to Bristol straight away.
RADO: Zaphyr, he looks bloody fucking awful.
ZAPHYR: Yeah. Really?
all that dirt and sand in there, nowhere to hide the blood in, no skin.
shit! It's fucking disgusting.
he's not gonna make it.
of course not gonna make it, with all the blood and guts coming out.
shit.
stop! Stop the car! Stop the fucking car!
Luke: Don't shoot!
don't shoot! The girl's in the car!
stop! - LUKE: The girl's in the car!
stop the fucking car! Give me the fucking keys.
give me the fucking keys.
MIRIAM: Get down! Get down!
can't you get it moving any faster? For God's sake!
come on. Come on.
stop!
stop!
THEO: Shit.
KEE: They're coming! They're coming!
MIRIAM: Get going, get going! They're getting closer!
Oh, God! He's gaining on us!
can I shoot? I got a clean shot!
fuck off!
Miriam, jump-start the car!
KEE: We have to go!
wait till it gets faster!
all right! All right! Just push, you push!
fucking hell!
KEE: Miriam! Miriam!
we have to wait for him! Theo!
go, go, go!
MIRIAM: Kee, are you all right? - I'm fine.
we need to find a safe house.
THEO: Yeah, the last one was really fucking safe.
well, what do you suggest?
don't worry. I know where to go.
wait here.
Oh, fuck.
fuck.
Jasper?
Janice?
Jasper?
Oh, fuck! - Oh, fuck you.
what are you doing with this shit?
this? I mix it with bread to poison the rats.
it's not bullshit what they say. They pass away quite peacefully.
Jasper.
meet Miriam and Kee.
MIRIAM: The Tomorrow is a hospital ship disguised as a fishing boat.
they'll take us to the Human Project.
I told you, amigo, the Human Project is real.
Yeah, but you're also the guy that believes in UFOs.
tell them about that thing you saw on the heath.
you saw a UFO?
did you know that the Human Project is supposed to have a community on the Azores?
it's a sanctuary. That's where they'll take us, Kee.
can you catch this ship anywhere else?
it's going to stop at the last two weather buoys enroute at sunset.
so it will be tonight at Windsmore and then two night's time at Bexhill.
you can forget about Windsmore. We'd never make it in time.
no, it's our only chance. We can't get to Bexhill.
that's a refugee camp.
Eureka! Eat and rest.
with a little bit of luck, you're going to need all your energy.
where are you going? - Feed her for me, Theo.
Kee, your baby is the miracle the whole world has been waiting for.
did he really see a UFO?
KEE: Is she doing her voodoo hoodoo?
she's doing something.
she smited me with that. Said it was good for my baby.
does she look posh to you, or gawky?
earnest.
Yeah.
how many months? - Eight.
it takes nine months.
I know.
who's the father?
Whiffet. I'm a virgin.
sorry?
that'd be wicked, eh?
Yeah, it would.
fuck knows. I don't know most of the wankers' names.
you know, when I started puking, I thought I catch the pest.
but then my belly started getting big.
nobody ever told me these things. I never seen a pregnant woman before.
but I knew.
I felt like a freak.
I didn't tell nobody.
I thought about the quiet thing. Supposed to be suave.
pretty music and all that.
then the baby kicked.
I feel it. Little bastard was alive. And I feel it. And me, too.
I am alive.
Froley. - Froley.
name my baby Froley.
it's the first baby in 18 years.
you can't call it Froley. - Says who?
Kee, I've found you a boat.
KEE: Great. - How?
guess what.
what?
I can't move.
Yeah, well, you don't have to. You're in a car.
am I driving?
like a pro.
come on, wake up, you fuck. Come on.
did you try to help him get free?
briefly.
briefly?
when it came down to it, my life was more important to me than his.
selfish, huh?
we found these in your Spider.
actually, I don't drive a Spider anymore.
now I have a C8 Laviolette.
it's lighter, faster ...swims better.
right.
these three contain traces of ketamine......the same as we found in your blood and his.
this one had pure D-Tubocurarine... which we only found in him.
must've been something he took at the party.
no. DTC is not a party drug.
along with the other stuff in his blood, it paralyzed his lungs.
Kevin Franks did not drown.
he had already stopped breathing by the time you drove off the road.
he was breathing when we went off the road.
how do you know?
he was making me come.
what? You were having sex at 100 miles an hour?
hundred and ten. I must've hit a pothole.
your friend, Dickie Pep says he sold you 15 milliliters of DTC last Thursday.
I don't know any Dickie Pep, but he's lying.
or you are.
why would he lie?
you got him on some other charge and he's trying to deal his way out.
if he even exists.
you don't seem too upset by what's happened.
of course I am, I'm traumatized.
who knows if I'll ever come again?
I want that cunt in jail.
we haven't got a case, Roy.
well, just fucking make one. Please.
they'll order a psychiatric for bail.
I'll make sure we get somebody good and tough.
Dr. Glass. I'm Henry Rose, Miss Tramell's solicitor.
this is Catherine Tramell.
I shall be present during the evaluation.
well, that's fine by me.
I'll be asking fairly personal questions. If she doesn't mind your presence...
my client understands and agrees I should be present for...
maybe Dr. Glass is right and we should be alone for this.
I strongly advise you not to contemplate having...
so is this where we're going to do it?
Mr. Rose told you the purpose of this evaluation.
I'm applying for bail in a murder case.
the Crown wants to know if I'm a danger to myself or others.
you're the Crowrs shrink, so you'll say I'm dangerous.
my shrink will say I'm not, and the judge will flip a coin.
anything you tell me can be quoted verbatim in testimony... and can affect your case.
you can quote me all you want.
thank you.
well, I see that you're a writer.
what do you write about?
murder, sex, violence.
do you ever write about yourself?
not into autobiography.
Really? Why not?
maybe I like to just sit back and get other people to reveal themselves.
for instance, you look a little divorced.
what makes you think I'm divorced?
the ring line hasn't faded.
you're very observant.
Yeah, but am I wrong?
would it bother you if you were wrong?
would it bother you if I was right?
tell me something you're afraid of.
boredom.
is that why you like to take risks?
I do like to take risks.
like taking drugs and having sex in a speeding car?
like talking to me without having your lawyer present?
actually, that was your idea.
like being on trial for murder? That's risky. You could end up in prison.
not if I'm innocent.
innocent people end up in prison all the time.
not rich, innocent people who are represented by Henry Rose.
in that case, it isn't really exciting unless you're guilty.
Oh, I bet you like to take risks, don't you, Dr. Glass?
but I'm not the one who's on trial for murder.
not yet.
sorry, you're not allowed to smoke in here.
you know what I like about you?
you enjoy being in control.
like me.
sorry, sir. Can't let you through here.
well, I would say extremely intelligent. Gifted, accomplished.
yet inside, I believe she vacillates between a feeling of godlike omnipotence, and a sense that she simply doesn't exist, which, of course, is intolerable.
do you consider Miss Tramell to be mentally impaired?
not by legal definition, no. Not at all.
if released, is she likely to commit a violent crime?
I believe her behavior is driven by what we call a risk addiction.
a compulsive need to prove to herself that she can take risks and survive dangers others can't.
especially the subsequent encounters with the police or the powers that be.
why would a person do that?
the greater the risk, the greater the proof of her omnipotence.
her existence, really.
when you say she has a risk addiction, is this condition likely to get worse?
all addiction is progressive.
the addict always needs to take greater risks.
if other people are hurt or killed as a result of her behavior, that's not likely to stop her?
I think the only thing that'd stop her, I suspect the only limit for her would be her own death.
then she is a danger to herself.
Yes, I believe she is.
nice work, Michael. Well done.
Dr. Glass, did Catherine Tramell kill Kevin Franks?
no, I can't make any comment, sorry.
can you please tell us about the bail?
Dr. Michael Glass. What a big thing you are all of a sudden.
what are you doing here, Adam? Don't say you're writing about Tramell.
a sexy, omnipotent killer with a Random House contract.
why would I write that?
you don't know she's a killer.
no, but I hope she is, though. I mean, I pray to God she is.
by the way, I hear you were brilliant in there.
you're so lucid sometimes, it's just disgusting.
you thought about daytime television?
Denise always says you were born for the small screen.
and how is my wife these days? Having fun?
ex-wife, Michael. Ex-wife.
while we're chatting about killers, is there any chance of talking about George Cheslav?
who told you about Cheslav?
Denise?
that's got to be any shrink's worst nightmare.
a patient in your care suddenly runs amok, beats his girlfriend to death with a brick.
that was seven years ago, why talk about it now?
not quite seven, actually. Seven in July.
but you talked to him twice a week. He never indicated he'd harm the girl?
I don't talk about my patients.
Cheslav's dead. Can't you talk about them when they're dead?
no, not even when they're dead.
Michael, what are you doing here?
what did you tell Adam Towers about George Cheslav?
nothing.
can you give us a minute?
he already knew.
Really? Because he said you told him.
no, all I said was...
if he writes about that, if he puts it on his magazine cover...
he won't. You're just being paranoid.
you didn't do anything wrong.
right. I didn't. I was treating a patient that killed his pregnant girlfriend.
end of story. You make sure he gets that.
don't worry.
I'm up for the Douglas Chair at the university.
you know what that means to me. Do you think this is going to help?
I can't tell Adam what to write.
why not?
don't be stupid.
I think you're entitled to since you've been fucking him for over a year.
do you think I didn't know when it started?
it's a pity you never asked yourself why it started.
how was the court case with the mystery writer?
I hear she looks fabulous.
also very intelligent. Pathological liar. Narcissistic.
seductive, manipulative.
do you think she killed the footballer?
I have no idea.
everything she does is so perfectly composed.
it's designed to confuse or confound you.
you never know what's truth and what isn't. She's brilliant, really.
the masked psychotic. Your favorite.
I'm already working it into a paper: "Risk Addiction and Omnipotence.
you're writing another already?
I'm writing two, but this is the more interesting.
I'll catch you up.
Hello?
glass? It's Roy Washburn. Are you near a television set?
if you'll be quiet, I'll make a statement.
what happened?
the judge let her go.
let her go? Why?
the guy who said he sold her the DTC, the judge found out he'd perjured himself in another case ...and disqualified him as a witness. But I'll make you a bet.
what's that?
she'll do it again.
and soon.
only this time I will fucking nail the bitch.
so we've been considering those who wish to control others through their insecurity and their narcissism.
to study Nietzsche psychobiographically may seem naive.
wasn't it Nietzsche's work itself, which through deconstructive and post-structuralist readings induced the death of psychobiography?
paul Portman said he might go to Tavistock. I'm thinking I might go.
just be patient. Stay where you are for about a year.
but there's nothing holding me. - Trust me.
you know Dr. Gerst?
michael Glass.
it's a pleasure.
I saw your review of my book.
you didn't understand what I was saying about the analytic field.
towards the end you made one or two interesting remarks.
maybe one of these days we can discuss it.
I'd be honored. Thank you very much.
"one or two interesting remarks"?
that was a compliment, Michelle. Dr. Gerst was very impressed.
and it appears that our Michael has just been knighted.
Cheers.
Congratulations.
can I ask you a question? - Sure.
every day I see you writing and I am thinking, "What is he writing about?"
is it a novel?
no, but there was a novelist in it.
Really? Who?
I can't tell you that. Otherwise I'd have to kill you.
must be someone famous, then.
excuse me. Dr. Glass?
I'm Peter Ristedes. Adam Towers' assistant.
urbane magazine.
mind if I join you?
Adam asked me to see if you'd give us a quote for the article he's writing.
I believe he mentioned it to you.
he didn't seem to think you'd want to talk to him.
I'll take that as a "no comment," then?
Dr. Glass?
miss Tramell.
what are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
about the evaluation.
some of the things you said, I've been thinking about them a lot.
I'm sorry you had to hear all that.
got a minute?
come through.
what you said about me being addicted to risk......about having to do more and more dangerous things...What you said about me being addicted to risk......about having to do more and more dangerous things...
well, after you said it, I realized I was scared.
what exactly scared you?
for weeks before the accident I was having the same fantasy over and over again.
I even wrote about it.
the womans driving in the car, the mans making her come.
she drives off the road, the mans killed.
I feel like maybe I made it all happen.
that's why I'm here.
are you saying you'd like to go into treatment?
Yeah.
well, I think that's a very good idea.
I wouldn't be able to treat you, but I'd be happy to refer you to a colleague.
why can't you treat me?
it's not advisable for a doctor who's done a forensic evaluation, to then become that persors therapist.
why not?
therapy requires a great deal of trust, which is difficult for most people.
it's best to start with a clean slate.
you mean you don't trust me.
what I said about you at the hearing must have seemed very negative.
I'm sure you've got feelings about that.
I'd be happy referring you to another doctor.
this is Dr. Milena Gardosh. She has a clinic here in London.
you want to know the truth?
the reason I agreed to the evaluation was because I thought it would be fun.
I never...
I never talked to anyone who...
my patient's here.
what do I owe you?
you don't owe me anything.
but if you'd like to call Dr. Gardosh, I'm sure she can help you.
I don't shop around.
like you said, trust is very hard to come by.
I was hoping I might find it with you.
listen, why don't we schedule another meeting.
and then we can talk about this when we're not so rushed.
you look different today. More relaxed.
the more nervous I am, the more relaxed people think I am.
I wanted to talk about something you brought up last Wednesday.
you said before the accident you had fantasies of sexual excitement and driving off the road.
do you often have fantasies like that?
I have fantasies all the time.
fantasies involving violence, death?
people die in my novels.
I have to think of new and interesting ways to kill them.
what happens when you don't take risks?
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in here. It's a rule.
I don't like rules.
I have some of them, and that's one of them.
after the hearing, I was interviewed by a reporter from Urbane magazine.
Adam Towers. He said he knew you.
slightly. Why?
he told me about the Cheslav case.
I was impressed by what you did.
you knew Cheslav was dangerous.
still you protected him.
you honored his confidentiality, even at risk to yourself.
do you think you made the right decision?
or do you think you fucked up?
given what I knew at the time, I made the right decision.
so you still believe in confidentiality.
within legal limits. What exactly are you concerned with?
if I told you that I killed Kevin Franks, would you report me to the police?
no.
anything that happened in the past, I wouldn't discuss outside this room.
but if you told me you were going to murder someone specifically, and I thought you were serious, then, yes, I'd go to the police.
I might be manipulating you to create risk for myself.
do you want to talk about what happened to Kevin?
no, not really.
I was just checking your policy.
so have you decided?
about taking me on as a patient.
shooter had an ex-wife, a drinking problem, a drug problem, a complicated sex problem he was barely aware of.
and a tremendous amount of free-floating rage.
in short, he was a cop and a very good one.
on March 3rd...
the woman knelt naked at the foot of the bed.
her back to him, her head on a pillow.
shooter raked his fingers through her blond hair and twisted it tight.
she groaned, her breath catching, as he suddenly yanked her hair like a rider pulling on a horse's mane.
the veins on his arms bulged as he roughly drew her onto him.
do you remember that cop Washburn?
to him, the fact that I wasn't upset about Kevin Franks, was proof that I must've killed him.
then, when I wouldn't break down, he hit on me.
hit on you?
Yeah.
he said that if I fucked him things would go easier.
homicide cops are usually smarter than that.
I knew one once, in San Francisco.
Nick Curran.
they called him Shooter.
we used to get in his car and ride around , listening to 911 calls on his scanner, then speed over.
have you ever been to a murder scene right after it happened?
the body's still warm.
the watch is still ticking.
you can smell the blood.
we'd hang around for a while and then go have sex in Nick's car.
Nick used to say:
death is always there. It's the only thing that's real.
except maybe sex sometimes.
but only sometimes?
well, I fucked this guy last night.
I fucked him for hours.
you know, we did everything to each other.
the full screaming Masters and Johnsors greatest hits.
but you know, a week from now, I probably won't even remember him.
but, if I was with him when he died...
now, I probably would never forget that.
would I?
were you ever with anyone when they died?
no.
Christ.
we still have 20 minutes left.
I feel like a cigarette.
see you tomorrow.
she just walked out?
how Lacanian.
for her, time's a weapon.
everything's a weapon. Everybody's an enemy.
do you think she made it up about the policeman? Washburn?
I don't know. It's so hard to believe anything she says.
she's trying to seduce you.
they always try to seduce you.
Yes, but this one's different, isn't it?
I don't know. More fun maybe.
be careful, Michael.
by the way, I got a call from that reporter, Adam Towers.
what did he want?
I made everything sound boring. I assured him he didn't have a story.
what if he calls others? What if he calls Gerst?
Gerst won't talk to a popular magazine reporter. Are you kidding?
anyway, it was a successful paper.
published, on this occasion, under sole authorship.
well, thank God for that.
speaking of God, is Gerst coming?
we can only hope and pray.
that he comes or he doesn't?
I'm going for a smoke. Don't talk about anything interesting till I get back.
how long have you lived here?
about six years, something like that. Seven.
Hi, Dominic.
Hi, Milena.
thank you.
the beauty about antisocial behavior, is that it takes you away from other people, however briefly.
you're not an analyst.
I'm a writer.
Really? What do you write about?
Oh, the lurid, the sexual, the violent.
the basic instincts.
they're the most powerful, aren't they?
Milena.
Oh, Michael.
I'm sorry, I didn't ask your name.
Catherine Tramell. Milena Gardosh.
Oh, you're Dr. Gardosh.
I've heard so many wonderful things about you.
Catherine.
there you are.
Milena, Dr. Glass. I see you've met Catherine.
she's doing research for a novel about an eminent psychoanalyst.
I thought she might enjoy an occasion like this.
well, may I take your coats?
thank you.
excuse me.
would you put that in my pocket?
certainly.
Catherine, come this way.
what's going on? What was Gerst thinking of, bringing her here?
I'm sure he's no idea who she is.
where did he meet her?
she would have met him, believe me.
I can't stay here while I've got a patient here. I have to go.
I understand.
if you follow inter-subjectivity to its natural end, aren't you asking who's the patient and who's the doctor?
those were my very words.
very good.
note that one for future reference.
are you leaving because of me?
you must have known I'd be here.
is that a problem?
I know some people who play tennis with their shrinks.
I'm sure you do.
have sex with them. Sell them drugs. Work on their screenplays.
but I don't do that.
I was upset about our session today.
I felt I owed you an apology.
that's why I came.
we can go into that tomorrow.
I've got a better idea.
how about I ditch everybody and we go somewhere for a drink.
I told you, I don't socialize with my patients.
another one of your rules?
don't you get kind of tired of them?
you know, that's the nightmare of shrinkdom, doctor.
too many answers, too many questions...
...nobody gets laid.
okay, forget getting laid.
we'll just talk.
we'll talk tomorrow.
Michael. There you are.
Oh, my God. Did you see that woman that Gerst brought with him?
no.
actually, I was just looking for you.
what, in there?
I was looking for your coat. I thought we could go for a drink.
if that's all right?
Yeah. Great.
what's wrong?
turn around.
what?
turn around.
Oh, God!
Michael, it's Denise! Please pick up the phone! Please!
Michael, please pick up the phone!
Denise?
Hey, hey, hey. What's happened?
Thanks, guv.
come in, Michael.
Hey, you okay?
Hey, what's going on?
it's okay, I'm here now. Okay?
who lives here?
it's Adam's place.
Jesus.
what happened?
I don't know. The door was unlocked and I just came in.
I just saw him lying there.
have you called the police?
no. I was afraid.
Hello, Michael.
what are you doing here?
it's my wife. Well, my ex-wife.
she found him like that, then she called me.
I see.
and how did she happen to find him like that?
they'd been seeing each other and...
Oh, really?
since when?
it's why I moved out.
so I assume you weren't the best of friends?
no.
yet I saw you talking to him after the Tramell hearing.
it was just journalist stuff.
he was asking me questions about Tramell.
do you think she killed him?
who?
Denise? No.
no, not a chance.
I've known her for a long time. She could never do anything like that.
listen, Roy, I've told my story twice over. Is it all right if I go home?
all right.
Oh, by the way......this yours?
no, I just found it on the floor.
how did it end up in the rubbish?
I stepped on it. It was leaking. I just threw it away.
can I go?
Yes, by all means.
I assume you know Adam Towers was killed.
why would I know?
because of Denise.
Denise?
your wife. Your ex-wife.
I know who she is. How do you know her?
Adam introduced us a couple of times.
it was all very open. I knew about her, she knew about me.
knew what about you?
that I was seeing him too.
the Masters and Johnson guy. That was him.
so... You were sleeping with Adam Towers?
occasionally.
so, of course, Washburn thinks I killed him.
why would he think that?
I kill because I'm addicted to risk. Or to prove that I exist.
I'm not sure which one it is.
I never said you killed anybody.
but you think I did.
you think I killed Kevin, and now you're wondering if I killed Adam.
why don't you just ask me? Or is that too direct for you?
did you kill him?
if I said I didn't, would you believe me?
depends.
on what? The quality of my performance?
you know what? I'm glad Adam Towers is dead.
and you should be glad too.
if you're too uptight, I'll be glad for you.
whoever killed him did you a favor.
favor?
if he'd written that article on Cheslav, it would've ruined your career.
you haven't told me if you killed him. Can you put that out?
put it out now or you can leave, okay?!
is that better?
when you think about fucking me, and I know you do, how do you picture it, doctor?
Oh, I know you can't answer me, so just think it.
do you want it straight up?
you on top?
me on top?
do you want it from behind, on your knees, my face in the pillow?
do you want to beat me up, just a little?
not too hard.
Oh, a little harder than that.
do you want to come in my mouth?
what if I told you that I masturbate thinking about you?
that I make myself come, thinking about you making yourself come.
I guess we're out of time for today.
I'm terminating therapy.
send me the bill.
are you feeling all right?
miss Tramell, it's Dr. Glass here.
listen, I'm concerned about how our session ended today.
I'd like to talk through any misunderstandings, there might be between us.
as soon as you get this message, please give me a...
just call me when you can.
evening, Dr. Glass.
could I have a word?
sure. Upstairs.
is that German?
can I get you anything?
no.
so here's a surprise.
Adam Towers had a girlfriend besides Denise.
guess who.
Catherine Tramell.
you don't look surprised.
she's a private patient of mine.
I see. Since when?
not long.
so your ex and your private patient were both screwing Adam Towers.
that's quite a coincidence. Did they know each other?
I don't know. I don't think so. Did you...?
Tramell's prints were all over Towers' apartment, along with others.
but what's interesting is the last call he made was to her mobile phone, 90 minutes before he died.
her story is she was out walking all that time.
two hours strolling around Clerkenwell and nobody saw her, so...
come on, Michael. Talk to me.
I can't tell you anything. Even if I knew something, which I don't.
Franks was first. Towers second. There's bound to be a third.
this goes beyond confidentiality.
you've got a legal obligation to protect a potential victim.
you can't lock somebody up because you think they might do something.
why don't you tell me what you know about this article...
...Towers was writing about you and our old friend George Cheslav.
who told you he was writing an article?
his editor.
he'd been very busy. He had a lot of information on you.
what, and you think I killed him, to stop him writing some stupid article?
no. But just for the record, why don't you tell me how you spent last night.
between, say, 7 p. m. and 2 in the morning.
you know, broad strokes.
I had patients until 8 p. m.
then went to a party in Collingham Gardens.
I left there about 11 with a woman.
we came here and I was on my knees fucking her when Denise called.
on your knees, eh?
sounds like your evening was better than mine.
could I get her name? So there are no loose ends.
look, Michael, Adam Towers was fucking your ex-wife, and about to do the same to your career. I've got to ask.
Michelle Broadwin.
she's a psycho-pharmacologist at Victoria Psychiatric Hospital.
thank you.
I'll be in touch.
what does that mean?
I smell blood.
Yeah, not all of them, of course, but, you know, some of them.
they're all so sanctimonious, so judgmental.
all my friends, they drink too much. They snort too much coke.
miss Tramell, it's Dr. Glass here again.
I'm a little concerned I haven't heard from you.
I was wondering whether you're okay.
look, let me give you my home number. It's 0207...
sorry, it really got to me and I don't know why it seems to be doing that.
why it's getting worse. I mean, I was really excited.
you have no new messages.
the thing about Gerst is this:
the selection committee is just a formality.
this is the real interview.
relax.
be direct, candid.
but not too candid.
very good time. They always get lost on the way. Come in.
meet my new Mughal painting.
not another one.
an Indian goddess at peace. It has a tranquility to it, don't you think?
I wonder what the males are doing, loitering so close to her?
it's obvious. They're worshiping her.
as they should.
perhaps that's why she has eight arms to fend them off.
why don't you girls go outside while Dr. Glass and I have our chat.
come. Come.
come with me. You'll enjoy it.
so, Dr. Glass, I have a question:
do you think I'm insane?
pardon?
nuts? Bonkers? Off my trolley?
no, not at all.
but I might be if I recommended you for the Douglas Chair.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
george Cheslav.
a major drug dealer, under your care, brutally murders his girlfriend.
an inquiry is held......where Detective Roy Washburn......testifies that you acted professionally at all times.
you're blameless.
that's right, I was.
however, after the trial you experienced what we might term an emotional meltdown: Depression, occupational underachievement, marital problems, marital problems, and questionable professional conduct, much discussed at dinner parties around our great city.
I'm sorry?
now you want my support for the Douglas Chair.
no more Cheslavs, Michael.
no.
no more Cheslavs.
Catherine!
sorry. All right. Sorry, I'm just looking for someone.
God, Michael, how dramatic.
I know.
I thought she was in danger, but I know that's not the point.
she could be a murderer twice over, and you're acting like she's a princess you have to rescue.
don't patronize me, please.
it's driving me crazy.
there are over 550 million firearms in world-wide circulation.
that's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet.
the only question is...
how do we arm the other eleven?
you don't have to worry.
I'm not gonna tell you a pack of lies to make me look good.
I'm just gonna tell you what happened.
my name is Yuri Orlov.
when I was a boy, my family came to America.
but not all the way.
like most Ukrainians, we gathered in Brighton Beach.
it reminded us of the Black Sea.
I soon realized we'd just swapped one hell for another.
even in hell, an angel sometimes makes an appearance.
I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine since I was 10 years old.
of course, she didn't know I existed.
I was starting to think she had a point.
for the first twenty-odd years of my life...
...Little Odessa was to me what it is to the Q train...
...the end of the line.
little Odessa, New York - 1982
Oh, I did lie about my name.
it's not really Yuri Orlov.
there've been few occasions in the in the 20th century...
when it's been an advantage be a Jew.
but in the 'seventies, to escape the Soviet Union, our family pretended to be Jewish.
little about my life has been kosher ever since
how's it going, brother?
it's not.
that's Vitaly, my younger brother.
he was as lost as me.
he didn't know it yet.
Yuri, you're late.
my father took his assumed identity to heart.
he was more Jewish than most Jews.
which drove my Catholic mother crazy.
how many times?
I can't eat shellfish.
it's treyf.
you're not Jewish.
I like it.
I like the hat.
to remind us there is something...
above us.
I like that.
I'm going to temple.
you're not going to temple.
you go to temple more than the rabbi.
get off my back, woman.
God, will you ever wise up?
Yuri, don't forget to check the specials at the Palace.
growing up in Little Odessa, murder was everyday part of life.
russian mobsters had also migrated from the Soviet Union and when they came to America, their baggage came with them.
there was always some gangster getting whacked in my neighborhood, but I'd never seen it with my own eyes.
I had this knack of showing up five minutes before something went down, or five minutes after.
not that day.
it hit me.
it couldn't have hit me harder if I was the one who'd been shot.
you go into the restaurant business...
because people are always going to have to eat.
that was the day I realized my destiny...
...Lay in fulfilling another basic human need.
the next Sabbath, I went to temple with my father.
however, it wasn't God I was trying to get close to.
Eli, my eldest son, Yuri.
my contact at synagogue landed me my first Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns.
the first time you sell a gun...
is a lot like the first time you have sex.
you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
but it is exciting and one way or another, it's over way too fast.
gentlemen.
the new Uzi machine pistol.
big firepower in a small package.
this little baby uses 9 mm hollow points.
twenty twenty-five round extendable mags...
...Rear-flip adjustable sights.
silencer comes standard. Excellent recoil reduction.
muzzle jump reduced forty percent.
sixty percent improved noise suppression.
you could pump a mag into me right now and never wake the guy in the next room.
of course, that would eliminate your opportunity for repeat business.
I did have a natural instinct for smuggling contraband.
fortunately, back then a video camera was a big as a bazooka
here I'd been running away from violence my whole life, and I should've run towards it.
it's in our nature.
the earliest human skeletons had spearheads in their rib cages.
where have you been?
what if we had a customer?
God bless America.
beware of the dog? You don't have a dog.
are you trying to scare people?
no, it's to scare me.
remind me to be aware of the dog in me.
the dog wants to fuck everything that moves
wants to fight and kill weaker dogs.
I guess it's to remind me to be more human.
isn't being a dog part of being human?
what if that's the best part of you? The dog part.
what if you're really just a two-legged dog?
you need to see somebody.
stinks in here.
I'd always wanted to do something big with my life
I just didn't know what.
anyhow, I figured, if I was going into the gun trade,
I was going aim high.
vitaly, stop fucking around.
I want to talk to you.
you read the newspapers, Vit?
newspaper? It's always the same.
you're right.
every day there's people shooting each other.
you know what I do when I see that?
I look to see what guns they're using and I think to myself, why not my guns?
what, are you opening a gun shop?
already more of those in than McDonald's.
even with all the gangsters around here, the margins are too low.
you've figured the margins? Sure.
forget gang wars.
the real money is in actual wars.
between countries.
Yuri, what the fuck do you know about guns?
I know which end I'd rather be on.
I made the first sale.
we're already in business.
whoa, whoa. We?
I need a partner.
I don't know,
I don't know, Yuri. I don't know.
vitaly, I've tasted your borscht.
you're no fucking chef.
I can eat in the restaurant for free and I still don't eat there.
fuck you.
we're doing nothing with our lives.
I mean, this is shit!
this is shit!
it's true.
but maybe doing nothing's better than doing this.
I need you.
brothers in arms.
brothers in arms.
sir, may I interest you in the shoulder-fired SA-7 surface-to-air missiles?
the older Chinese model.
not so effective against modern military aircraft. But deadly If used against a commercial airliner.
I'm giving them away at 8-50.
in the '80s, and the Cold War was far from thawed
most of the deals were government-to-government.
it was a mostly private club...
...with a lifetime club president.
that's him. The big shot?
simeon Weisz, Angola, Mozambique, those Exocet missiles in the Falklands.
he was selling guns before there was gunpowder.
be right back.
Mr. Weisz? Mr. Weisz!
it's okay, they're talking.
may I help?
a mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman from Brighton Beach, import/export said to contact you.
I have a business proposal and I thought perhaps we could discuss it.
I don't think you and I are in the same business.
you think I just sell guns, don't you?
I don't. I take sides.
but in the Iran-lraq war you sold guns to both sides.
did you ever consider that I wanted both sides to lose?
bullets change governments far surer than votes.
you're in the wrong place, my young friend.
this is no place for amateurs.
motherfucker.
curious how you always revert to your native tongue in moments of extreme anger.
and ecstasy.
Oh God... Oh, God!
you are beautiful.
what's your name again?
the only option for Vitaly and me was under-the-counter gunrunning.
beirut, Lebanon - 1984
I got my first break in Lebanon after the suicide bombing.
but I wasn't the only local kid making good.
when the United States leaves a war zone...
they generally don't take their munitions.
it costs more to bring it back than to buy new stock.
so, we sell by the kilo.
they're secondhand weapons, but they're still okay.
how many kilos would you like?
five thousand.
I had a flair for languages...
...but I soon discovered that what talks best is dollars, dinars drachmas, rubles, rupees, and pounds-fucking-sterling.
of course, the U. S. Army got a piece of the action.
army salaries were no better then than they are today.
and some of the brass, like Lieutenant Colonel Southern...
needed to raise money for their own private wars.
good to make your acquaintance.
this is bullshit money,
this is small-fucking-potatoes.
what do you want to do, go more legit?
no, more illegal.
what I would give right now for cabbage and potatoes.
it's not our fight.
Vit, come on!
let's go. Come on.
selling guns is like selling vacuum cleaners.
you make calls, pound the pavement, take orders.
I was an equal opportunity merchant of death.
I supplied every army but the Salvation Army.
I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.
I sold communist-made bullets to fascists.
I hope you're not thinking of selling these, Mr. Orlov.
personal use.
personal use.
there's a hundred thousand bullets here.
I'm kind of trigger happy.
trigger happy?
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan when they were still fighting my fellow Soviets.
I never sold to Osama Bin Laden.
not on any moral grounds.
back then, he was always bouncing checks.
by the mid-'80s...
my weapons were represented in eight of the world's top ten war zones.
there's no problem leading a double life.
it's the triple and quadruple lives that get you in the end.
back then, I carried a... French, British, Israeli, and Ukrainian passport...
...and a student visa for the U. S. but... that's another story.
I also packed six different briefcases...
...Depending on who I was that day and the region of the world I was visiting.
north of Cartagena, Colombia - 1989
without operations like mine, would be impossible for certain countries to conduct a respectable war.
I was able to navigate around those inconvenient little arms embargoes.
there are three basic types of arms deal.
white, being legal.
black, being illegal, and my personal favorite color, gray.
sometimes I made the deal so convoluted...
it was hard for me to work out if they were on the level.
to keep authorities in the dark
I often spoke in code.
rocket launchers were "mothers."
the rockets, "children."
the AK-47 assault rifle was the "Angel King."
it's Yuri... Yeah. Well, Raoul...
Raoul, the Angel King will arrive tomorrow.
Hallelujah to you, too.
the point is, if I've done my job right an arms embargo should be practically impossible to enforce.
what?
okay, just slow the fuck down.
I can't understand you.
wha-what do you mean, tipped off?
they know where we are? Well, where are they?
well, how long have I got? Not long?
what does that mean? Shit!
do we try to lose them? On this?
Yuri, we have to get off this thing.
no. No one's going anywhere.
slow, dead slow. Buy me time.
Yeah, it's Yuri.
get that fucking rag down!
I need another handle for this tub.
something in our weight class.
you! Over the side.
we're changing the name. Now!
Yes, it's got to check out.
the way I look at it, what's in a name?
have you got a shorter name?
I'd often changed the registration of a ship or a plane...
...but never on such short notice.
Damn! They're hauling.
what? Kono? How do you spell that?
K-O-N-O, okay, well, that's good.
what are we flying? Dutch? Got it.
Vit, get me a Dutch flag, will you?
faster! Or I'll send your ass in!
Yuri, I don't have Dutch! What?
I've got Belgian. What the fuck use is that?
he's painting a name registered in the fucking Netherlands.
I've got a French flag. So?
turn it sideways...
...It's Dutch.
that's why you're my brother.
all right, good!
everybody look innocent now.
they say every man has his price.
but not every man gets it.
Interpol Agent Jack Valentine couldn't be bought.
at least, not with money.
for Jack, glory was the prize.
Yeah, it's the Kono; it's not the Kristol.
Kono, K-O-N-O.
it's clean, sir.
it's clean?
it sure doesn't look clean.
I'm going to go aboard.
phone in a sighting of the Kristol south of Aruba.
even when I was up against an overzealous agent...
...I had a number of methods for discouraging a search.
I routinely mislabeled my arms shipments "Farm Machinery."
and I have yet to meet the lowly paid customs official who will open a container marked "Radioactive Waste" to verify its contents.
but my personal favorite is the unique combination...
of week-old potatoes and tropical heat.
smells.
sir, Sighting of the Kristol, due north.
most importantly, I kept a number of intelligence people on the payroll to supply their colleagues with counterintelligence.
let's go.
the second rule of gunrunning is:
always ensure you have a foolproof way to get paid.
preferably in advance...
ideally to an off-shore account.
that's why I chose my customers so carefully.
say what you like about warlords and dictators...
they tend to have a highly developed sense of order.
they always pay their bills on time.
what is this?
six kilos of pure.
I can't hand this to my fucking bank teller at Chase Manhattan.
listen, asshole, you should be thanking me.
have you checked the street price today?
with the seizures at the border last week, it's jumped thirty percent.
whoa... whoa-whoa!
I sell guns. I don't sell drugs.
diversify.
I've got standards.
you don't pay, you don't play.
fuck you!
what are you doing? Fuck you!
fuck you!
no, you don't fuck him.
we can work something out.
no, Vit!
we have a deal!
the first and most important rule of gunrunning...
is never get shot with your own merchandise.
are you okay?
I think so.
so what do we do now?
let's celebrate.
that narco guerilla had his facts right.
after shipping it stateside, the return on that blow netted me a healthy profit.
it would have been even better, except one kilo never made it back.
vitaly?
Vit!
to this day I don't know what Vitaly...
...was running away from.
maybe just from Vitaly.
I found him twelve days, two thousand miles, and one hundred and fifty grams later in a Bolivian boarding house.
of course, my dream girl had gone there before me.
Vit!
come on!
fuck, Yuri's back.
it's my brother, Yuri.
he's my big brother.
what the fuck is that?
ukraine.
I was young, but I remember.
look... I start in Odessa, right?
and then I work my way to the Crimean
you'll be dead before you fucking reach Kiev!
we're going home. Come on,
you fuck! You fucking fuck!
you fucking fuck...
what the fuck is your problem?
come on, Vit.
J. F.K. Airport, New York - 1989
Yuri, it's so nice to be home. Yeah, good work.
we're gonna get you home.
come on.
St. Francis Rehabilitation Center
get out of the car.
vitaly, I need you to get out of the car.
I promised our parents.
please.
vitaly, you're going to have a great time.
this is a top place.
two Ford models checked in last week.
and that cute weather girl's been here since July.
please.
please, Yuri.
you're a good brother.
you're a good brother, Yuri.
okay. All right.
good brother.
all right. Get out of the car.
okay
get out of the car.
from then on I was a one-man operation.
I never understood what separated...
the recreational drug user from the habitual.
but for the grace of God...
it could've been me snorting lines as long as the Belt Parkway.
however, I wasn't entirely free of the grip of addiction myself.
there she was again.
Ava Fontaine.
in my neighborhood they say, "The good get out."
in our own ways, we'd both conquered the world.
St. Barts, French Caribbean - 1989
you can't force somebody to fall in love with you.
but you can definitely improve your odds.
it cost me 20 grand to book he for a fake photo shoot.
another twelve to buy out the hotel.
popular hotel, huh?
Ava Fontaine. Yuri Orlov.
what brings you to St. Barts?
photo shoot.
at least, that was the plan.
I guess the photographer got stuck in Miami.
hurricane. Though there's nothing on the news.
those things can come out of nowhere.
so... the job's been cancelled, and wouldn't you know it, there's no flight to New York until Tuesday.
you can hitch a ride with me if you like.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
meanwhile, why don't I take your picture?
in my experience, some of the most successful relationships...
are based on lies and deceit.
since that's where they usually end up anyway...
it's a logical place to start.
right there. Hold it there.
Oh, my God!
I nearly went broke trying to convince her I was anything but.
I knew Ava was not the kind of woman to be seduced by a ride in a private jet unless you owned the jet.
this is your plane?
that is my name.
of course, I was lying.
the plane was rented, like the car and even the suit I was standing in
at the last minute, I'd bribed the crew for the paint job.
luckily, by the time we landed...
Ava wasn't looking anywhere but in my eyes.
I had no idea.
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.
don't apologize. I put clothes on for a living.
a least you're not taking them off.
I would be, if half the photographers had their way....
what about you?
I'm in transport.
international air freight, mostly.
business is good.
Where're you from?
I was born in Ukraine, but I grew up in Brooklyn.
no.
what, you too?
Williamsburg.
here's to a hurricane.
without it, I never would have met you.
this is no accident, is it, Yuri?
it feels like fate.
I don't believe in fate.
what do you believe in?
is that a view, or is that a view?
that's a view.
thank you. Thank you all.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
always remember, son...
there is something above you.
sure, Dad.
a forty-thousand-dollar crystal chandelier.
make yourselves at home. Go!
go!
I'm sorry. Today must be tough.
it'd be nice to have a couple more guests from my side of the family.
I'm sure they're watching right now.
thank you.
but you don't believe that, Yuri...
...Remember?
I know you, Yuri.
I know you're not everything you seem.
don't worry, I won't ask a lot of questions.
I don't want to hear you lie.
you take risks.
just promise me you won't risk us.
that's the trouble with falling in love with a dream girl.
they have a habit of becoming real.
I've never been so glad to see Vitaly.
you're fucking beautiful!
brother...
brother, thank you so much...
for giving me such a beautiful sister.
he was out of rehab, and out of his mind.
dance! Dance! We have to dance!
all right, all right It's a wedding, a celebration
to Yuri!
for once, he rescued me.
new York - December 25, 1991
I was still living way beyond my means.
mortgaged to the hilt, using one credit card to pay another.
anything to keep Ava in the style to which she had thanks largely to me become accustomed.
Ava
Ava, this is too much.
Yuri likes to spoil you.
then suddenly, all my Christmases came at once.
Nicki, you did it! Good boy!
that's my grandson!
Yuri, don't you want to see what your son is doing?
whoever said it's better to give than receive...
...Never got a Christmas present like the one I got in 1991 from Mikhail Gorbachev.
what the hell's the matter?
it's over!
what's over?
the Cold-fucking-War! The Soviet-fucking Union
the Evil fucking-Empire! Mikhail's saying no mas.
he's throwing in the towel.
it's over!
your son is walking.
that's incredible, honey.
at least they'll get religious freedom.
let's hope so.
I think I'll go back for a visit.
do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?
I'm not a fool, Yuri.
I don't think you're going to Odessa to sell Pepsi-Cola.
is this how you want to be remembered?
I don't want to be remembered at all.
I'm being remembered, it means I'm dead.
Merry-fucking-Christmas!
who is this, Vitaly?
I'm Angel.
her name really is Angel.
she's a fairy.
let's put her on top of the Christmas tree.
come on
I love you.
