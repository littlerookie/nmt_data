he kisses really hard.
you know, you could have told me about you and Mike.
but I suppose it doesn't matter anymore.
Ooh! We're getting on so well!
it's like we've been together for ages.
I think he's falling in love with me.
he is. No, he is. I can feel it.
we'll probably sleep together tonight.
I bet we'll get out tomorrow.
I have a strong feeling we'll get out.
like, someone will find us, right?
do you think you can hang on that long?
get away from her! Get away!
Frankie, wake up! Frankie, talk to me.
Frankie, speak to me.
[muffled] Oh! Oh, my fucking God!
what's wrong?
are you sure...
Frankie, what's wrong? What is wrong?
wake up! What's wrong?!
Oh, my God. Fuck!
you fucking killed her!
liar, what have you done?! What have you done to her?!
what have you done?!
I didn't...
Geoff, it's going to be awful, Geoff.
please, stop touching her.
[sobbing] Please, Geoff.
she's fucking dead!
stop fucking touching her!
Liz: I'm so sorry, Frankie.
Frankie, I'm so sorry.
what happened? What did I do?
you were my best friend. What am I going to do?
I'm sorry, Frankie.
don't fucking look at me like that.
I hate it when people look at me like that.
it's not my fault if you don't like what I have to say.
Frances was bulimic.
we know that from the lack of enamel on her teeth.
the dramatic bleeding came from a tear in her esophagus.
she died on the 10th day from heart failure.
carry on.
do you think she'll haunt us?
she'll haunt you.
why me?
why you?
why you?! You fucking bitch!
because it's your mistake, your idea, your fault!
you!
does that help at all, Geoff?
you!
Geoff, she's sorry. Isn't it obvious?
she didn't do it on purpose. Just fucking leave it!
you didn't care about fucking Frankie!
you're right.
I didn't give a fuck about Frankie, all right?
we're just a pair of fucking assholes, right?
Liz: I keep thinking about her mom and her dad and about how they're going to feel when they find out.
for the love of you!
I killed...
no, you didn't.
I did. It's my fault. I'm sorry.
look, okay, it's not your fault, okay?
it's not your fault.
I don't know what happened to Frankie, but it wasn't you.
it wasn't you.
Really?
really, okay?
so what we've got to do is try our best to keep strong, so we can get out.
I don't really blame you, Liz.
I'm going nuts.
I keep thinking I can smell the body.
I think I'd rather tear my face off than smell her rot.
I have such a terrible headache.
everything looks blurry.
I know what that means.
it's all right, Geoff.
don't think about it.
take it.
take it. -[Sighs]
[sniffs] Thank you.
you okay? -[Gasps]
I'm sorry.
what are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
you're not well. You should lie down.
I have to tell you something.
Lizzie, it's the dehydration.
no, Mike.
please. -No, Mike, listen.
please, stop torturing yourself, okay, please?
it's not important anymore. It's not your fault.
I have to tell you something.
[Air hisses] -What?
you fucker!
no, Mikey! I was gonna share!
I was gonna share!
[Can clatters] -Don't! Stop!
geoffrey Bingham. Severe head injuries.
this one was murdered.
[sobbing] Oh, my God.
Unh!
look.
we could go together.
fuck, no.
I can't do this anymore.
this food will keep us going a little longer.
we could still be found.
we're not going to be found.
they would have found us by now.
look, Mike, it'll be really quick, right?
we'll just fade away...
you're stronger than that. I know you are.
we've kept going this long. We can hold out. Please.
it's worth it.
Lizzie, I can't do this without you.
you've kept me going. If you go, I'll have nothing.
I need you.
I love you, Liz.
I... love you.
how the fuck did you do that?
the key.
I always had it.
but I couldn't tell you. How could I?
it was all for you.
for me.
because I love you.
all of this was for you.
for me.
[Voice breaking] I killed my best friend.
you let me think I was gonna die.
and you watched me kill my best friend.
I killed him for a fucking Coke!
you let Frankie die!
you fucking held her hand!
and you let her die!
you fucking bitch!
fucking whore!
[Gasps] No, Mike! -You fucking bitch!
Mike, you don't understand! I didn't mean -- Mike!
Mike, no!
what are you doing?! You don't understand!
what are you doing?! Stop it!
stop it!
Liz: He was the reason I breathed.
I stood there, felt my heart die, my soul wither.
I wanted to be with him so much that I could just feel myself slipping into the air.
but then I thought, at least this way...
he never grows old...
he never cheats on me...
never leaves.
this way, he just stays perfect.
you need to say what you just said to me on tape with a solicitor and your parents present.
Why?
your statement needs to be official.
I'm not making a statement.
you have to.
that's what the families and the police have been waiting for.
I just told you.
they're not going to understand.
look, even you don't understand.
I don't see why I should be punished for something that went wrong.
it was an accident. -You are still responsible.
I'm not ruining my life for this.
it's out of your hands now, and Martin will corroborate what you just told me.
everyone is dead, and you told them that I locked you in?!
I was away. I had no idea you couldn't get out!
it's too late.
Philippa, what the fuck are you doing?!
help! Help!
[Panting] Thank God.
what's wrong? -Thank God.
help!
help! -It's okay.
I was scared. I thought she was going to hurt me.
we have Martin.
you're in deep shit.
you have Martin? -Yeah.
suicide.
guilty as hell.
I'm not a Christian. I'm not an atheist.
I'm not Jewish. I'm not Muslim.
my religion and what I believe in is called the Constitution of the United States of America.
hang on. - Did you get that?
and let me open these up. - Hmm?
okay, go ahead.
if I'm not religious enough for you, don't vote for me.
if I'm not experienced enough for you...
don't vote for me.
uh...
you know what? Don't vote for me. Don't. Don't do it.
whatever you do, don't vote for me. How's that?
okay. We got it. Thanks. - Okay.
can we get the monitors up? I'd like the governor to be able to hear himself?
you got it. - Okay.
are we gonna put risers under these podiums like we discussed in the preconditions?
no, I know. We didn't get the specs till last night.
they'll make something slide under there. Okay. Thank you.
it's just they're few inches short. It makes it hard for him to read his notes.
gentlemen, Thank you... and I'll see you in few hours.
I didn't know the governor has trouble reading his notes. Why doesn't he wear glasses?
no, he doesn't. Just, Pullman's just 5/8. He's gonna look like a Hobbit.
well, it all comes down to this.
we are one week away from the Ohio primary.
two Democrats are left standing Senator Pullman of Arkansas trailing Governor Morris of Pennsylvania.
Morris has mounted a sizable lead, with 2047 delegates, winning New Hampshire, California, New York and Michigan.
but Senator Pullman, with 1302 delegates, is still in the hunt, having won Florida and Tennessee and Virginia and Missouri.
a win in Ohio could turn it all around for the Arkansas senator.
one week from Tuesday, the all-important 161 Ohio delegates could be the deciding factor.
as goes Ohio, so goes the nation.
how would that matter? - Let me quote.
"I have no idea what happens when we die.
maybe nothing. Maybe it's like before we were born." Unquote.
you did write this. - Let me be specific.
please do.
I was raised Catholic. I am not a practicing Catholic.
I have no idea what happens after we die.
if the senator does, he should be president. I'll vote for him.
is that your idea of being specific?
let me be more specific. - Thank you.
I am not a Christian or an atheist. I'm not Jewish or Muslim.
what I believe, my religion, is written on a piece of paper called the Constitution.
meaning that I will defend your right to worship whatever god you believe in, as long as it doesn't hurt others.
I believe, we should be judged does a country by how we take care of the people who cannot take care of themselves.
that's my religion.
if you think I'm not religious enough don't vote for me.
if you think I'm not experience enough or tall enough...Then, don't vote for me.
I can't change that to get elected.
I just wanted you to say if you believe in the Bible.
is this a Democratic primary or a general election?
well, whoever wins this contest will be running for president.
if you think that these questions won't be central in a general election, you are living in fantasy land.
I'm pointing to the obvious.
we are running for president of the United States, not student council president.
double? Yeah, double.
fucking national security.
out of the park. Home run.
the alumni of Miami University of Ohio, thank you for attending tonight's debate and ask you to remain in your seats until candidates have left the stage.
thank you very much.
I'm trying to remember if the Democrats have ever nominated an atheist before.
well, we know they've nominated a jackass before.
must have been you that did that prep work, Stephen.
Paul's not that clever. You've always had the brains.
but me, I've had the balls.
well, it looks like you've got some brains now too.
be careful. I just might have to steal him from you.
hm.
what a prick.
So...Paul, tell me something I don't know.
tell me what's going to happen on the 15th.
Oh, God. What? What?
what do you think, Stevie? I think it's ours for the taking. You?
Yeah. Ben? - Yeah, we'll win.
what do you think, lda? - I'm asking you.
Oh, you tell me, I'll tell you.
if l had to say, I'd say it'll be close, but you'll eek it out.
eek?
you see? She's trying to get under my skin.
so, what's gonna happen? Us by nine.
you're certain you're gonna win.
certain, no. Confident, yeah. You said you'll win.
I think we will. I'm not gonna tell you it's a sure thing.
saint Gabriel can get his Four Horsemen to rig the ballot boxes for Pullman, and it wouldn't surprise me.
six presidentials I've done. I've never felt this good.
but I'm not gonna sit here and say, "Yeah, we'll win Ohio."
not a chance.
in the last 30 years, 73 Democrats have run for president.
how many have won? Three.
that means 70 guys ran who thought they had a chance, and they all lost.
so you're saying there's a good chance you won't win.
don't twist my words.
what I'm saying is I'm not gonna promise you we'll win.
but he's decorated by Bush Senior from the first Gulf War protested the second left his state with a balanced budget and the fourth-highest education rate.
the Republicans have no one that can touch this guy.
for this moment, this election, this primary is the presidential.
and that, Ida, is the state of the union.
and on that note...
I'm gonna take a shit.
so, Stephen. - So, Ida.
Stephen, Stephen, Stephen. Ida, Ida, lda.
Paul's going to the airport. Yeah.
he's getting on a plane. That's what you do, yeah.
Where's that plane going?
okay.
I'll give you three guesses. He's not going back to headquarters.
correct. He's not going to Texas.
no need. We're gonna split Texas.
what if I said North Carolina?
is that your guess? He's going to North Carolina.
I can neither confirm nor deny that. I knew it. Now tell me why.
I cannot do that. Ugh. I hate you.
you love me. I love Paul. You, I hate.
you love him because he gives you the scoops.
sexual favors. You're engaged.
if it meant a good scoop, my fiance would understand.
you're really buying into this crap.
all this "take back the country" nonsense.
Ida, I'm not naive, okay? I've worked on more campaigns than most people have by the time they're 40.
I'm telling you, this is the one.
you really have drunk the Kool-Aid. I have drunk it. It's delicious.
look, l don't care if he happens to be leading in the polls and if he happens to have all the right tools.
the truth is, he's the only one that's gonna actually make a difference in people's lives.
even the people that hate him.
if Mike Morris is president, it says more about us than it does about him.
I don't give a fuck if he can win. He has to win.
or what? What? The world's gonna fall apart?
it won't matter, not one bit, to the everyday lives of everyday fuckers who get up and work and eat and sleep, go back to work again.
you know, if your boy wins, you get a job in the White House.
he loses, you're back at a consulting firm on K Street.
that's it. You used to know that before you got all goose bumpy about this guy.
Mike Morris is a politician.
he's a nice guy. They're all nice guys.
he will let you down, sooner or later.
this is off-off-off the record. What?
Franklin Thompson. Seriously?
off the record. Not go through the Governor, Steven and Me.
my lips are sealed.
tomorrow l have a meeting at Thompson's house.
he's going to endorse you? After I'm done talking to him. What do you think?
that's huge.
more than huge. He has 356 pledged delegates.
they all travel with him. Puts us over the top.
he said publicly he's not going to endorse anybody.
well, that's what they all say till you get them alone.
so this is for real. - Yep.
just about in the bag.
when are you going to announce?
Nope, that's all you get for now.
okay, listen up. These are your new cell phones.
Shelly's preprogrammed your numbers.
thank you Shelley. No personal calls.
if you lose them, the DNC will come to your house.
new cellphones. Give me your old. I'll get it later.
l gotta believe we can do it.
we have to understand why our enemies are our enemies.
and see if there's something we can do about it. Besides, just using force.
as we know from history, the answer to extremism can't be extremism.
fucking kill me.
where did we get this?
some town-hall meeting in Pennsylvania.
thank God it wasn't overseas. Just get rid of it.
if it plays to his base, why don't--? - Are you stoned?
this is the piece the Republicans are gonna run.
we don't need to brag about it.
I'm Neville Chamberlain. I'd like to be your commander in chief.
but then, this is gonna come out anyways. If it's gonna come out
then it's gonna come out, but it's not gonna come out paid for by us, pal.
you think there's any truth, in this... Pullman having investments...
in a diamond mine in Liberia?
still checking on it, but we got it from a blog.
I don't care if it's true. I just wanna hear him denying it.
if it is true, great.
but if not, let them spend the day telling the Post that he doesn't own a diamond mine in Liberia.
win-win. - Okay.
we gotta counter that Christian shit, we take it from last night. - Got it.
I need the new 30-and 60-second spots.
we can show him in the staff meeting this afternoon, so...
Hey. Hey.
Ben wanted me to get you to sign off on this before the meeting.
okay. Thank you, I've been waiting for this.
anything interesting?
this is some white paper I have to hand out tonight.
what's white paper?
negative shit. Our oppo guys do research, we feed it to the press, see what sticks.
what kind of negative shit?
you'll read the paper tomorrow. Which paper?
any. Any paper. So it's something big?
I wish it was something bigger.
it's just these transportation numbers.
I have to spin pretty hard to make it stick.
that's what you're good at, right? I guess.
tell him it's fine.
did you get your new phone? Mm-hm.
it's really exciting, isn't it?
what are you, a Bearcat?
am l a what?
Cincinnati Bearcat?
Oh, no. I'm not from here.
I worked with you in Iowa, actually.
Oh.
that's right.
but you changed something.
my hair? You changed your hair.
no.
Oh. l see.
bet you I look like a real dumb-ass now, huh?
no, not at all.
you're the big man on campus. I'm just a lowly intern.
Oh, it's not like that.
you get to stay at the Millennium.
they put us in a motel. You're right.
I am the big man on campus. Now you're starting to see.
Mm-hm.
we do have a better bar, though. I've heard that.
you should come by one night. Have a drink with the worker bees.
I might do that. I might do that. What's a good night?
tonight's good. Tonight? Tuesday night?
Yeah. It's quiet. Quiet's good.
well, you have my number.
I do?
it's programmed there in your phone.
Aha.
under "Mary." I know your name's Mary.
my name is Molly.
Yep.
that's what I'm hearing.
since Super Tuesday, all of a sudden, I'm a very popular guy.
what are your polls telling you?
that Pullman's negatives are high. Mid 40s.
senator, we have an open seat in the White House.
the Republicans have dick. They're disorganized.
they can't find a nominee that's not a world-class fuck-up.
they look like Democrats.
no Republican's gonna show up to vote for their guy.
but if Pullman's got a Democratic nod, they will show up to vote against him.
you think, if they won't for your guy, you think Morris gets into the independents?
I sure do. Senator, I'm a bit confused.
we need your delegates.
we need you.
your fundraising.
and l guess it was my understanding that your endorsement a week before Ohio would win this for us.
thank you. Estella.
hand me that ice bucket.
is this Paul, or is this you? - Paul knows and Paul agrees.
Ben, where's my outback piece on National Service?
it's easier for me to work off of that. - Got it right here.
get me a hard copy, I hate those fucking things. - Can we print it out?
Molly, can you grab that out for me - Yeah, one second.
so if you wanna change or refresh-- Just give me a second, will you?
your national service isn't polling the same as the rest of your policy.
I don't give a shit about the polling. I'm not gonna play this game.
your good-cop, bad-cop act with Paul.
good-cop, good-cop.
I'm not changing it.
here we go.
all right, let's see.
it says we're gonna help people get an education, gonna create national unity, teach young people a trade, and get them out of debt from their college loans.
where does that fail? All of that's exactly right.
just, if you're gonna do it, do it.
make it mandatory, not voluntary.
now, that'll poll well. Mandatory.
everybody who turns 18 or graduates high school gives two years of service to his or her country.
it can be in the military, Peace Corps, planting fucking trees, l don't care.
for that, your college education is paid for, period.
we do all of that here.
no, sir, you don't, not all the way. Do it all the way. Mandatory.
paul likes this? Mm-hm.
you're my brain trust.
the beauty of it is, everybody who's over the age of 18 or passage of eligibility will be for it.
why not? And all of the others
can't vote.
too young.
too bad.
you can't lose.
uh, Stephen? - Mm?
you have a call on Line 3. - It's your dad.
okay.
you and Ben work it into the speech.
get me a hard copy and I'll write it in my own words.
you have Charlie Rose at 6. Right. Yeah. Why am I doing him?
it's long-form. He's flying in.
paul going?
paul won't be in, but Ben and I will take you.
just don't tell me someone's died.
Hey, Steve.
who is this? Tom Duffy.
sorry about the dad bit.
I uh, I just figured you wouldn't my name called out on Morris's Campaign Office.
what do you want? You got a couple minutes?
I'd like to sit down with you. What for?
well, l think it's important.
if it's important, don't you think you should be calling Paul?
I'm calling you.
this is on the up-and-up. Give me five minutes.
I can't be talking to you. l hear you.
but I'm gonna be at the Head First for the next couple hours.
I can't, Tom.
there won't be anybody there. Okay?
you get a chance, there's something I wanna show you.
Paul, call me back. It's important.
you're working for the wrong man.
you are.
Oh, on the contrary, you are working for the wrong man.
you got something the other guys don't have.
Oh, yeah? What is it exactly?
"charm" is not the right word.
it is the right word. No, it's more than that.
you exude something. You draw people in.
all the reporters love you. Even the ones that hate you love you.
you play them like pieces on a chessboard and make it look effortless.
and we both know how hard it is constantly being on guard, weighing every word, every move.
but from the outside, you make it look easy.
people are scared of you.
they don't understand how you do it and they love you for it.
that's the most valuable thing in this business.
the ability to win people's respect by making them mistake their fear for love.
guess what I'm gonna say next.
I don't think that l can. - I want you to work for us.
what, are you kidding? - No, not in the least.
you're gonna lose Ohio. - I am not.
Oh, you're sitting on about a 6-percent lead in both polls.
six percent of all Democrats polled.
eight. - No, six. Doesn't matter.
ohio's an open primary, right?
independents and Republicans vote on the Democratic candidate.
do you think they like your guy?
a pro-choice tax-and-spend liberal? - No. Fuck, no. No, they hate him.
they think they can beat my guy.
but they're very worried about yours.
so starting tomorrow morning, you're gonna see a fucking blitz.
limbaugh, Hannity, all those right-wing blogs are starting a get-out-the-vote campaign.
it's started already.
every conservative in Ohio is gonna line up around the block to punch my guy's ticket, and that's just one step.
ohio's gone. Polls don't mean shit.
tomorrow everybody's gonna know.
that's why I want you to handle the fallout that we'll have in the press.
Oh, and we got Thompson in the bag too.
I know for fact you don't have Thompson.
no, we promised him secretary of state.
ohio's over. It has been over for weeks.
and now with Thompson's delegates? Huh.
I'm thinking down the road here, man. That is why l want you.
I can't do it. Bring you in at the top.
all right. l don't need an answer right this moment.
look, I've played dirty. I'm sorry to hear it.
but I don't have to play dirty anymore. You know why? I got Morris.
none of this is about the democratic process, Steve.
this is the shit Republicans pull. - Yeah, you know what?
this is the shit the Republicans pull, and it's time we learned from them.
they're meaner, they're tougher, they're more disciplined than we are.
I've been in this business 25 years.
I've seen too many Democrats bite the dust because they wouldn't get down in the mud with the fucking elephants.
Paul's my friend. - Do you wanna work for the friend?
or do you wanna work for the president?
think about it. You got my number.
Paul.
Hey, they don't make quaaludes anymore, do they?
not that I'm aware of. What's going on with Thompson?
uh, he wants something, but...
we'll be fine. What was so important?
nothing. Figured it out.
all right. I'll be on my cell if you need me.
I fly to D. C. tomorrow, back tomorrow night.
okay. I'll work on the Quaaludes.
good man.
check the blogs, see if there's any chatter, would you?
what kind of chatter? I don't know.
just see what they're talking about. Stevie, you still single?
I'm married to the campaign, governor.
he's married to the campaign. Good answer.
wall Street Journal has our numbers holding.
Pullman dropped a point. When did they do that?
checking now. Governor, Pullman's down a point.
we're moving in the right direction.
Ben, are you still single?
married to the campaign, governor. Crack team.
make sure Charlie Rose has those numbers before he goes on.
I'm on it.
get a copy of the show before we leave too.
is it a difficult decision? I have to believe it is.
would I do it? No.
but I can't see myself or anyone telling a woman what she should do with her body.
you would appoint a judge?
I would consider it arrogant to judge anyone until I've walked in their shoes.
but you're against the death penalty?
because of what it says about us as a society.
suppose, governor, it was your wife.
and she was murdered, what would l do?
it gets complicated when it's personal.
sure. Well, if I could get to him, uh, I would find a way to kill him.
so you, you, governor, would impose a death penalty.
no, I would commit a crime for which I would happily go to jail.
then why not let society do that?
because society has to be better than the individual.
if l were to do that, I would be wrong.
what about guns?
isn't it time for a commercial?
this is public television. - We don't have commercials.
that's unfortunate.
where did you go after Lowa?
California. For Super Tuesday.
Oh.
I had to go to New York. I know.
you guys needed a lot more help over there.
Yeah.
so why politics?
because the pay is so good, obviously.
it seems like a very odd fit.
my dad is Jack Stearns.
Oh, he's a good guy. He's an asshole.
but he's your boss.
he's not my boss.
he's the head of the DNC.
you don't work for the Democratic National Committee?
I work for Paul. Paul works for Morris.
and if Morris wins, he's gonna be your dad's boss.
don't tell my dad that.
don't tell your dad a lot of things.
never.
what time you gotta work tomorrow?
nine a.m.
I'm showing the new interns how to robocall.
it's because I'm the experienced intern, you see?
I see.
how old are you?
how old do you think l am?
you think I'm 30? Sorry. How old are you?
how old are you?
how old do you think l am?
20 - Twenty. - Yep.
that's young.
is that too young to fuck a 30-year-old?
well...
the laws are different in different states.
here, at your hotel, here in Kentucky, it's frowned upon.
Oh.
but if we go across the bridge into Ohio
where your hotel is.
Yeah, surprisingly, they're very lax about their child-endangerment laws.
do you have a car? l don't drive. - I took a cab.
I have the keys to the campaign bus.
this has been tried before.
operation Chaos, as Limbaugh called it, where Republicans voted for a Democrat they could beat in the general election.
we asked Senator Pullman's campaign manager if he's happy getting the votes of right-wingers.
is it decisive? No, of course not.
but we believe the polls are within the margin of error and that the senator will win Ohio.
Yeah, what time's Paul get in?
shit. Who do we talk to about polling?
I gotta get some internal polling on the independents and wing nuts.
do you want me to go?
what's that guy's name from the Wall Street Journal?
you sound busy. l should go. Hold on, I'd like to talk to you.
Adler, yeah. Get him on the line.
nobody. The cleaning lady.
tell him we're gonna take the same position we've always said:
the race is a lot closer than the polling.
no, don't say that. Don't.
just get him on the line and call me. I'll take care of it. I'm sorry.
cleaning lady? Yeah.
you called me the cleaning lady.
you're not mad about that, are you?
no, why would l be mad? Right.
l spoke with Jack Stearns.
Oh, hey. Look.
l know you're looking for a reaction, but listen.
we have two great candidates in a very tight race.
and at the end of the day, the voters will decide who best can represent this party.
but doesn't this kind disruption take away from what you wanna be pushing this year?
you're right. Your dad is an asshole.
I'm gonna tell him you said that. Heh. Yeah, do that.
you wanted to talk?
I just wanna be clear. I don't want there to be any confusion.
I'm not gonna tell anybody about last night.
that'd be great.
you know how people are. Yeah.
really wouldn't look good if you screwed an intern.
it's not like that.
it's not like l got drunk. I like you.
I just don't want there to be any expectations.
you don't have to say anything. All right.
I just don't want you to think I'm a player.
you are kind of a player, but...
I was being polite. Bullshit.
you were trying to pick me up. - No, I wasn't.
you were pretty obvious about it.
I was? Yeah.
I thought I was being subtle. No, you were pretty forward.
you were pretty forward asking me to the bar.
well, been trying to fuck you for a while.
Wow.
it's kind of slutty of me, huh? Not at all.
I respect it in some strange way. Good.
you have no idea how to tie a tie. No, no, not a clue.
you're very mature.
for a teenager.
when are you coming back?
I'll be at the event a little late. These cocksuckers, fucking dirty shit.
what happened with Thompson? Nothing. Prick.
we had him all sewed up, motherfucker.
how bad is it?
I don't know. l just-- I'm running the numbers, Paul.
all right. I'll-- I'll be there in three hours.
I want hard numbers and a strategy.
Yeah, I'm on it. I gotta go.
you okay? Yeah. Trying to figure out our stops.
think the weather might determine that.
if we get there.
we're gonna be fine.
we have to do it. It's the right thing to do.
nothing bad happens when you're doing the right thing.
is this your personal theory? Because I can shoot holes in it.
roberto Clemente on a humanitarian flight.
well, there's--There's exceptions to every rule.
so how we doing?
I think we're fine now. - No, the campaign. How we doing?
Oh, great.
Stephen, you're not Paul.
I pay Paul to use the word "great." I pay you to tell me the truth.
I think that we are solid.
okay, Paul.
governor, there's a big difference between Paul and me.
paul only believes in winning, so he'll do or say anything to win.
but you wouldn't.
I'll do or say anything if l believe in it.
but I have to believe in the cause.
you'll make a lousy consultant when you're out of this line of work.
well, l won't be out of this line of work as long as you're in it, sir.
so at best, you got eight years.
then you end up at a nice consultant firm off Farragut North, making 750 grand a year, eating at The Palm, pimping out ex-senators to Saudi princes.
pimping out ex-presidents.
then I better win.
Yeah.
now, I've been married for 11 years.
we have a normal marriage.
which means when we disagree, she wins.
what we don't disagree on is how we're gonna leave this planet for our daughter.
are we gonna leave it better off or worse?
the richest people in this country don't pay their fair share.
and when they're asked to, they cry socialism.
they use phrases like "redistribution of wealth."
Yeah.
that scares everybody, and they all run and they hide.
for the record, my campaign is vehemently against the distribution of wealth to the richest Americans by our government.
and l will run on that.
I didn't think it was true, but I should've told you.
slow down. I'm sorry.
I met with Tom Duffy yesterday.
what?
you were on a plane. He called me and asked if we could meet.
I said, "Why?" He said it was very important, so I did.
and l should have told you. Stop. Let me get this straight.
you met with Tom Duffy. Yeah.
What'd he want, Stephen?
the gist? He wants to hire me. He wants me to jump ship.
this is really fucking bad.
he told me they had poll numbers that had Pullman ahead.
we're in big trouble. He laid out their strategy.
doing robocalls, traffic jams, fake lit, and Thompson.
they offered Thompson secretary of state.
you know how you fight the war on terror?
you don't need their product.
their product is oil. Just don't need it and they go away.
we don't have to bomb anyone. We don't have to invade anyone.
if this is some kind of fucking practical-- I mean
my fucking blood pressure's going through the goddamn roof.
Paul, I'm sorry.
believe me.
I didn't think it was true. It doesn't matter what you thought.
it matters what you did, what you didn't do.
you're right. If this is true,
I made a fucking ass of myself and l gave away our game plan.
I honestly believed you were gonna come back and tell me we have Thompson in the bag.
I didn't see the point.
it doesn't make it right, and I'm sorry. Let me think.
let me think.
if I'm your president, the first thing I'd put into motion is 10 years from the day I take office, no new car in America is run on an internal combustion engine.
we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, we will start the next technological revolution, and we will lead the world again, like we used to.
get the governor after he finishes singing "Kumbaya."
and we give him everything we know.
who do you want? You, me and the governor. That's it.
what's he have after? He has a fundraiser.
he'll be late.
we tell him if he doesn't offer Thompson the position, he's not gonna get the nomination.
is he gonna go for it? I don't fucking know, Stephen.
find us a room.
how real are the numbers?
we lose by 3 or 4 percent.
who fucking knows, governor? But we can't take the chance.
what do you think?
we fold up the campaign in Ohio, take a loss, blame it on Republicans playing games, head to North Carolina.
I can't run from Ohio. They'll kill us. Not if you get Thompson.
I'm not gonna do it. What's he want? Head of the FDA or something?
cabinet post.
Yeah, what, labor? State.
are you kidding? I'm gonna give secretary of state to a guy who wants to cut the top 10 floors off the U.N?
when we started, l said I wasn't gonna make those deals.
if you lose Ohio and they get Thompson's delegates, then they get North Carolina, then they get the lead.
a lead you can't beat. If we walk from Ohio, take Thompson, give him the Cabinet post, then we take North Carolina, his state, then Pennsylvania, your state, and then it's simple math, Mike.
take his endorsement and the race is over.
Paul, l respect you.
I respect your opinion.
I'm never gonna do it.
so l suggest we find a way for me to win Ohio.
anything else?
it's not gonna cut it. - Every car company.
they've booked every van for Tuesday.
fuck. l gotta call you back.
all of them? All of them.
you're killing me. - Here's what l got so far.
independents aren't biting, but the Republicans are.
they're not gonna tell a pollster they're voting Democratic.
I can't find the goddamn polls. We can get 100 vans out of Kentucky.
we don't need the vans. - That's not what I'm saying.
we don't want Pullman to have vans. - We were the underdog before.
we continue to be the underdog.
well, then-- Yeah, we always knew the numbers were gonna get closer.
we're not lowering expectations.
I mean, have I ever said to you that we had Ohio locked?
give me the courtesy of printing that in your column.
what are you writing?
the greatest speech ever given on hydrogen power.
the bar is set awfully high on that one.
don't l know it.
I was hit up by Mitchell's wife for you to show up at her Daughters of the American Revolution luncheon.
who's Mitchell?
congressman from the First District?
you might wanna remember that.
fucking congressman. Could you imagine doing this every two years?
no, I can't.
let's just do it one more time. Mm-hm.
in four more years. That's it.
it's a deal.
do you think we'll lose Ohio?
I don't know.
if you took Thompson's delegates, the race would be over.
ohio wouldn't matter.
is Paul working on you?
Stephen.
they are good. Mm.
is Thompson so bad? He's a shit.
is he worse than Pullman? Yes, Stephen.
every time, I draw a line in the sand and then l move it.
fundraisers, union deals, I wasn't gonna do any of it.
negative ads.
I can't on this one.
not Thompson.
tell Mrs. Mitchell I'll make her goddamn luncheon.
let the old ladies pat me on the head.
you've got great hair. You too, baby.
gay marriage. - It's a silly argument.
not to 50 percent of Americans. Over the age of 50.
that's who votes, that's who shows up at polls.
that's changing. Hopefully, the way we frame the argument is as well.
from a religious...? From a religious to a civil-rights issue.
but one could argue a great difference between gender and race.
we used to ban interracial marriages. Women couldn't vote.
I have the guy from Proctor & Gamble.
keep an eye on the governor. Okay.
I gotta know what's going on. Yeah, yeah, okay.
all right, wait, wait. She's got a point to make. Go ahead.
the argument is that men and women can be considered separate but equal.
races cannot. How so?
you have separate bathrooms for men and women, but it would be illegal to have separate bathrooms for races.
now. Yes, now.
see, we're framing the argument...
what time is this thing airing? - Nine o'clock.
how'd we do? We did good.
do you need me to clean your room tonight? xoxo
we're framing the argument on the idea that you choose to be gay, not that you were born that way, like being born African-American.
lf you start the discussion with the idea that gay is not a life choice but is actually part of your DNA, then gay marriage can and must only be a civil-rights issue.
that's what l believe. That's where l stand.
do you think your candor is your appeal?
sorry.
fuck. It's not you.
Molly? - Hello?
Hey, your phone rang.
Hm? Your phone rang.
it did?
who's calling you at 2: 30 in the morning?
I don't know.
Really? Because he asked for you by name.
you answered it? I thought it was my phone.
who is it?
I don't know.
is it one of those interns drunk-dialing you?
now, that never happens.
let me see the number.
Oh, boy. Give me my
no. I'm calling him. Stop it.
it's not funny. I'm saying I'm your dad.
it's not funny. Give me my phone. Hang up.
I have a shotgun. Stephen, hang up the phone.
why is the governor calling you at 2: 30 in the morning?
Molly.
why is the governor calling you at all?
I'm in trouble.
with the governor?
what's going on?
I was working on the campaign in Iowa.
there was a party in Ben's room after the rally.
there was a party with you and Ben and the governor?
no, he wasn't there. Where was he?
I took him up a hard copy of the polling numbers.
after the party?
it was around midnight.
I just stood in the doorway with him, just talking for a really long time.
he just reached behind me and closed the door.
Jesus fucking Christ.
were you drunk?
not that drunk.
how many times? It was just that once.
just the once? Just once.
does anybody know? No one.
anybody see you? No.
how could you know? I know.
then why is he calling you right now?
I called him first.
Why? I didn't know who else to go to.
and l needed 900 bucks.
for what?
I can't go to my dad.
we're Catholic.
so, what should I do?
Stephen?
what's up?
what's our limit on petty cash?
it's probably 500. Why? I need everything we can get.
everything okay?
need help with anything? Yeah. Don't put it on the books.
that's all.
what should l put it down as? Don't put it down as anything.
anything over 1 00, l gotta put down-- Just do it.
Molly.
meet me in the stairwell at noon.
okay. I'll take it back.
that's all.
Yes, lda? - Stevie, off the record.
no, I cannot tell you what happened in North Carolina.
that's not what l wanted to ask you about.
okay. What? You met with Duffy.
who told you that? A little bird.
who? Did you meet with him?
where are you?
I know you met him with at a bar in Cincy just before the press conference.
duffy ordered buffalo wings. - Who said that? Duffy?
anonymous. What happened with Duffy?
you're supposed to be my friend. Why you wanna stick the knife in me?
you thought we're friends? I've given you everything you wanted.
every story, every scoop, your profile on Paul.
you've given me a lot, but get real.
the only reason you treated me well was that I work for the Times.
you give me what l want, I write you better stories.
don't pretend, it's any more than that.
why'd you meet with Duffy?
go fuck yourself. Okay, I'll make it easier on you.
what happened at Paul and Thompson's meeting?
keep your voice down. Do you have any idea what this could do to me?
that's why I'm giving you a choice.
I could get fired.
so it's not a difficult one, is it?
I've gotta file by 3 p. m. tomorrow.
you've got till then to make up your mind.
you motherfucker. - Excuse me?
you leaked it. Leaked what?
don't bullshit me, Tom.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I just spoke to Ida Horowicz. Yeah?
she's threatening to release the story.
what fucking story? That we met. That we fucking met.
how did she find out? Don't play dumb, Tom.
you think I leaked it to her? Yeah. Who else?
I didn't leak it to her. l know I didn't, so that leaves you.
okay. Well, what does she know?
she knows whatever you told her.
I swear to Jesus I did not leak it to her.
I don't want this out any more than you.
well, too late. What did she tell you?
she knows where we met, she knows when we met, she knows you had fucking buffalo wings.
she has a source? Yeah, she has a source.
and you have no idea who it could be?
Yeah, you.
well, for the record, it wasn't me, and I didn't have fucking buffalo wings.
so it's gotta be someone else.
did you tell anyone? No. Did you?
no. Did you admit to meeting with me?
no. All right.
then we stonewall her and she's got nothing.
she's gonna take the story to Drudge or Roll Call or some shit like that.
you can't stop her?
she's trying to blackmail me. She wants info about Thompson.
well, then tell her what she wants to know.
l can't do that.
you can't let this get out. I'm not gonna be blackmailed.
you don't have much choice here, Steve.
if l tell her about Thompson, I have to tell her he's endorsing you.
then tell her. l can handle it from my side if l start getting calls.
no fucking way.
paul told her we had Thompson. It's gonna make him look like a fool.
he's gonna look like a fool anyway when Thompson endorses us.
I can't do it.
you know, you're on a sinking ship.
tell her what she wants to know and jump.
come over to our side. We can control this thing.
Steve? I gotta go.
I'm up here.
you scared the shit out of me.
here.
it's almost 1 800 bucks.
you gotta make the appointment now, like today, from a pay phone.
I'll take you to the clinic and pick you up, but no one else.
you understand?
Yeah.
take the rest of the money and buy yourself a ticket home.
can't be here. We can't afford it.
not with everything that's gonna happen in the next week.
and this situation just can't be here.
you mean l can't be here. Right.
Stephen, I wouldn't tell anyone.
I hope not.
then why?
because you fucked up.
he and l both fucked up. That's true.
but I have a responsibility to him and, more importantly, to this campaign.
I could go to North Carolina and work.
Molly, you gotta wake the fuck up. This is the big leagues. It's mean.
when you make a mistake, you lose the right to play.
make the appointment.
tell me when and where we have to go.
listen to this. I got the placement in the Times.
bumped like 600 fucking articles. Tom Duffy, 2008:
"this is a matchup between, Hope Versus Fear.
nine times out of 10, the fear candidate tends to be most experienced.
but in our presidential races, the least-experienced candidate wins.
JFK vs. Nixon. Carter vs. Ford. Bush vs. Gore.
I like our chances with the new kid on the block."
end quote. Thomas fucking Duffy.
he's gotta be having a stroke right now.
so just call me when you can leave, okay?
I hate this shit.
I'm gonna come back, and this is all gonna be over.
Yeah.
Absolutely. There's no question about it.
Yeah, but we gotta think broader strokes here.
just rethink everything.
uh... Well, yeah, I know how to handle it.
um, look, Stevie just got here. Can I call you back in a few minutes?
okay, bye. Ahem. The governor.
we had a good long talk on the way back.
he's up to speed with everything.
how'd he take it?
better than I thought he would.
still won't take Thompson's endorsement.
I gotta tell you something I don't know how to tell you.
what's up?
Ida knows that I met with Duffy.
I don't know how she knows, but she knows.
and she tried to blackmail me.
she's gonna release the story unless I tell her about your meeting with Thompson.
so it's gonna hit the papers.
probably.
and whoever she takes it to is gonna call me for a statement.
if l deny the whole thing but Duffy admits to it, it's gonna look worse.
and if I just say, "No comment," they're not gonna let up.
I leaked it to Ida.
at the event.
I don't understand. We made a deal.
Paul, they're gonna...
they're gonna print that story in the paper tomorrow.
I know.
so why'd you do it? Why would you do that?
why would you do that to the campaign?
the campaign will survive.
why would you do that to me? Makes it easier to let you go.
what?
why'd you meet with Duffy?
I made a mistake. I made a stupid mistake.
no, you didn't make a mistake, you made a choice.
you left a message to call you back, it was important.
when I did, you told me to forget it.
you chose not to tell me. Why'd you make that choice?
because I didn't think it was important.
Oh, fuck, yes, you did.
you went because you were curious. You felt flattered, you felt special.
to think that Duffy wanted to speak to you instead of me.
you thought, "Maybe I can get something out of this."
because it made you feel big.
you know, the first campaign I ran, it was a tiny little race in Kentucky.
state Senate seat, working for some redneck nobody named Sam McGuthrie.
no staff, no money, no fucking office.
everyone thought we didn't stand a chance.
no way we can compete, right? About this time, this guy running this campaign a few districts over gives me a call, and he says, "I really like what you're able to do for poor old Sam, but he's a goner.
why don't you come work for me?" What did l do?
well, Stephen, this is where you and I are different.
I told Sam about the call. And Sam says to me, "Paul, if you think this other guy's got a chance at winning and he can pay you more and if it's what you need to do, then I won't get in your way."
and l say, "Sam, you took a chance on me and hired me when I was even more of a nobody than you are.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna jump ship just because the shit hits the fan.
we lost that race, but when Sam decided to run for governor, who do you think he called?
we won that race, and 20 years later I am where I am fucking now.
there's only one thing l value in this world, and that's loyalty.
without it, you're nothing and you have no one.
and in politics, in fucking politics, it's the only currency you can count on.
that's why I'm letting you go.
not because you're not good enough or l don't like you.
but I value trust over skill, and l don't fucking trust you anymore.
it doesn't matter whether you trust me. It matters whether the governor does.
the governor already knows, and he thinks it's the right thing to do.
he does? Yeah, and you know what?
if l were you, I'd get a good night's sleep, because you're gonna get pounded by calls from the press in the morning.
Hey. - Hey. Where were you today?
um, I'm not feeling great today, Ben.
you picked a hell of a day to call in sick.
Jesus, it was a fucking wild-ass day. Why? What happened?
Stephen's off the campaign.
paul fired him. Some setup about loyalty.
stephen may have been doubling down with Duffy.
I was sitting in the room when Paul told Stephen he was fired.
stephen said, "Who's gonna take over?" And Paul said me.
I know, and I'm like, "Easy there, soldier."
stephen goes apeshit, Paul gives him this speech and then shits on Stephen like I've never seen before.
humiliating shit. When was this?
Molly, listen to me.
I'm gonna run the campaign under Paul.
Stephen's going to Duffy. I just jumped three years ahead.
so starting tomorrow morning, we go into full damage control.
and I'm telling you, Stephen's going apeshit.
he said he's taking everybody down on his way out. Morris, everybody.
shit. I gotta take this. Do you need anything?
no.
Paul. What's up? I'm mailing you all those files.
Where's Duffy? You got an appointment?
can we have the room for a minute?
okay. Thank you.
it's not too bright walking in here like that, Steve.
I'm in.
I'm coming to work for you. A reporter phoned me this afternoon.
Yeah. I know who leaked it.
who? Paul.
you told Paul?
I told Paul, and he leaked it. Oh, Steve.
you shouldn't have told him that. I felt like l should.
Yeah. I've worked with Paul. He gets paranoid.
obviously. So he fired you.
I quit. No, you're lying to me. Come on.
I quit. I'm gonna give you everything.
I'm gonna give you Morris, his whole strategy.
I already have it. Paul gave it all to Thompson.
what if I had something else?
you would do that to Morris? To Paul?
Yeah. Oh, no.
revenge makes people unpredictable.
I can't have someone who's unpredictable, unstable.
I'm not. If this had been a clean break, if you had left Morris before the story broke, that, we could control.
but like this?
paul fires you, and then you wanna come work for me?
it makes me look like I'm picking up scraps.
it puts Morris in the driver's seat. I can't have that.
what if I had something big? Like what?
something big.
something that'll put Morris down.
what is it?
give me the job.
no, that's not gonna happen. I'm sorry.
go take a nice long vacation. You're a smart guy.
everything that I said the other day is absolutely true.
but, you know, maybe politics isn't for you.
politics is my life.
you know what? Do yourself a favor. Get out now, while you still can.
go into entertainment or business.
go open a fucking restaurant in Costa Rica. Anything.
do something that's gonna make you happy, okay?
you stay in this business, you're gonna get jaded.
like you. Yeah, just like me.
you knew I was gonna fucking tell Paul, didn't you?
no, I didn't know. I thought you might, but I didn't know.
you knew I was gonna tell him, and you knew he was gonna fire me.
that's the thing about Paul. He's big on loyalty.
Yeah, l know. I just got a big speech on it.
you were never gonna hire me.
put yourself in my shoes, Steve.
your opponent has the best media mind in the country working for his team.
what are you gonna do?
you're either gonna hire him, or you're gonna work it so if you can't have him, the other team can't either.
this is a win-win situation for me.
you come work for me, great. Paul doesn't have you.
then again, Paul fires you, I don't want you, fine.
paul still doesn't have you.
either way, I win.
and the moment l got you to sit down in that chair...
I knew I'd won. This is...
it's my life that you're talking about.
it doesn't make me happy doing this. Don't think it gives me any pleasure.
no, I'm sorry for you. I really am.
take care of yourself.
the third floor. I'm coming to you.
nothing.
no. No, ma'am. She's not breathing.
I don't know. Fifteen minutes.
do you know her?
she's gone.
I'm sorry, what?
Oh, yes, now, I can hear them now.
we're on the third floor.
Yes.
Yes, ma'am.
um...
where are you? It's, uh-- It's 4-something.
they're gonna close up in a few minutes.
Stephen, it's Ben. - Listen, what the fuck?
Jesus. What are you gonna do?
Stephen, um, I just heard from Ben.
please don't do anything fucked up.
goddamn it, you motherfucker, pick up the phone.
don't do this.
I'm not going away.
the coroner stated that based on evidence found in that hotel room, this was an accidental overdose, a lethal cocktail of alcohol and drugs.
police Chief Darryl Matthews has called for a full investigation pending a toxicology report, which could take up to two weeks.
just a terrible, terrible situation for the former senator, now-DNC chairman Jack Stearns and his family.
I want on the ticket.
you need me on that ticket, and you could use my delegates.
and you need them before Tuesday.
make a fine story on the Sunday-morning news cycle.
so l expect to hear from you by noon tomorrow or l endorse Pullman and take that Cabinet seat.
anything else you wanna talk about, Stephen?
the entire staff is... - We're in a state of shock.
we send our condolences to Jack and Joanna Stearns and their family.
of course, our hearts go out to them.
it's hard to imagine what they must be going through.
what we know right now is that it appears to have been a drug.
an accidental prescription overdose.
Ida? - Is suicide ruled out?
we have no reason to believe.
I don't think we have that information, but there will be a full investigation.
we just wanted to say that our hearts go out, our prayers go out, to the entire family.
she really is-- She was part of our family.
Yeah. Did you know her well?
not well, but l did know her.
and what l saw was a hard-working young woman with a great spirit.
it's just a sad day for the campaign.
and it's a sad day for those of us who know Jack.
governor, how long has she interned for you?
uh... You wanna...? Yeah.
she had only been on the road with us for a few weeks.
maybe four weeks, I think. I can check.
will you be continuing with your schedule today?
Yes, we will most certainly stay on schedule.
seems like you have something you wanna talk to me about.
does it seem that way?
if you have something you wanna get off your chest, then why don't you?
how about l do the talking and you do the listening?
okay.
as of tomorrow, there's gonna be a few changes to your campaign.
Paul's out. I'm your senior campaign manager.
I'll draft a statement.
the campaign got to a point where we needed to make changes.
you can put your own words in there. Why would l do that?
because you wanna win.
because you broke the only rule in politics.
you wanna be president?
you can start a war, you can lie, you can cheat, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't fuck the interns.
they'll get you for that.
what do you think you have, Stephen?
troubled young girl tells you a story. Troubled young pregnant girl...
that what she told you? who needed cash for an abortion.
you give her money?
maybe she needed cash and you were the perfect guy to hit up.
is that your best play? You need a job that bad?
you come in here with your dick in your hand? You got nothing.
then how did l get in here?
you're right, Mike, there's nothing. No voice messages, no texts, no e-mails, no pictures, no tape.
and yet I'm standing right here.
Yeah, well, go home.
she left a note.
how would you know that? I was cleaning up your mess.
I took her phone, and l found a note.
I thought it was an accident. I don't know.
you're gonna have to tell me. You're the last person she called.
note says she's pregnant, got an abortion, and doesn't wanna hurt you.
then why would she leave a note that could only do that?
because she's 20.
what do you want? Paul's gone. Today.
I set a meeting with Thompson. You promise him the ticket.
you get 356 pledged delegates, you get North Carolina, you take office, and make right what so many people have made wrong.
all the things we both believe in. I don't believe in extortion.
I don't believe in tying myself to you for eight years.
four years. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
huh.
what were you doing in her room?
housekeeping before you made Page 1 .
you were fired, you were out. What were you doing in her room?
I was fixing a situation.
someone from the hotel thought l could help and called.
so you were off the campaign, but you thought it was important to fix things?
it was your voice the other night on the phone.
you were fucking her.
What'd you do, Stephen?
I lent her money and gave her a ride. I bet you did.
there's no note.
okay, there's no note. Show it to me.
you think I brought it here?
that's how people get hurt.
okay, let's play this out.
you're not wearing a wire, because everything you suggested is illegal.
and you wouldn't fare too well in federal prison.
you were fucking her, and she told you about her situation.
there are no records or conversations between us, and since she's had an abortion, there's no DNA evidence.
so if there's no note...
then it's your word against mine.
your word.
a fired, disgruntled employee.
or a sitting governor.
there's no note.
it's your call, governor.
Paul, you got a minute? Yeah.
how much could a shake-up like this, days before the Ohio primary, hurt a campaign?
l asked Paul Zara how his firing could help the candidate.
the governor and l felt that in light of these changing numbers that it was best to put a new face on the campaign.
stephen is very talented, uh, very smart.
you always hear people talk about events out of sequence, the order of things.
there is no greater grief than a parent laying their child to rest.
she was a little girl trying to make it in a very grown-up world.
a world where every mistake is magnified.
and she was smart and pretty and so, so young.
father, you ask us to accept God's plan, to not question his judgment.
with all due respect, I don't accept this judgment.
she made the world better.
not just for me, but for everyone she touched.
you should hire Jack for a speechwriter.
I'll keep it in mind.
you come here to see me? No. Friends of the family.
got her the internship.
I've known her since she was born.
I'm sorry.
governor couldn't make the flight?
he's meeting with Thompson.
look at you.
all grown up with tits and all.
I learned from the best.
well, one day we'll grab a beer, and you can tell me what you had on the governor that put me out.
how do you know l didn't have something on you?
well, you better get going.
you have a campaign to run, I've got offices to look at.
Farragut North?
nice consultant firm right off of K Street.
million a year.
no one to fuck you over.
sounds relaxing. Doesn't it?
the right man to lead this great nation of ours in these challenging times, and the next president of the United States of America,
governor Mike Morris.
we like Mike!
and let me ask, one very important thing.
that all of us stand shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, in a united Democratic Party.
so l strongly urge the 356 loyal delegates that I have carried as a badge of honor throw their support to the governor.
let's put this primary behind us and get on with the business of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
governor Mike Morris, ladies and gentlemen.
senator Thompson, thank you.
all right, Mr. President!
well, the polls aren't quite closed, but I congratulate Senator Pullman and his Republican constituents on their win here in Ohio.
senator Thompson, l am honored to stand here with you today.
and l am humbled by your kind words. Thank you.
today marks the beginning of a fight between two sets of ideals.
either we're gonna move forward, or we're going to live in the past.
either we're going to lead the world in technology or we are going to bury our heads in the sand.
the sands of Saudi Arabia, the sands of Iraq.
either we're going to let greed and corruption ruin our industries and our shorelines or we are going to take back our country.
we are not a nation used to coming in second or third.
no, it's not decisive. - We still have several contests to go.
those states are gonna wanna have their say.
it looks like we're gonna win Ohio.
you must concede, sir, that these 356 delegates put the pledged delegates out of reach.
the super delegates are breaking 3 to 1 for Morris
we still have several contests to go, and Ohio was a big win for us.
then do you have the funds?
of course we have the funds. We get new donations daily.
Hey, Ben? - Yep?
I was told to talk to you. I'm supposed to get a phone.
and you are...? Jill Morris.
no relation.
you a Bearcat, Jill Morris? No, I'm from Columbus.
I'm a Buckeye.
you're making me look bad.
how so? I filed the story that said you're off the campaign and Thompson's going to Pullman.
can't believe everything you read.
wanna give you an opportunity to comment on my next story.
it says you delivered Thompson.
you got the 356 delegates, you delivered the nomination.
all you asked in return was Paul's job.
any chance of you confirming? No press behind this point.
I'll read about it in the funny papers. Come on, Stephen.
aren't we friends anymore?
you're my best friend, Ida.
Jay, this is Sean in New York. - Can you get him to run a mike check?
if you could count to 1 0 for me.
good. Okay.
senator Thompson, l am proud that you have brought integrity back to this election.
because that's what this integrity.
who we are.
because how we project ourselves to the world matters.
dignity matters. Integrity matters.
our future depends on it.
Morris! Morris! Morris!
we have Governor Morris' senior campaign adviser,
stephen Meyers, coming to us from Xavier University where Senator Thompson has endorsed Governor Morris, essentially ending this primary race.
Stephen, can you give us some insight into how this whole thing unfolded?
it's her! I know it's her!
she wants to tell us something!
we must do something! Please.
in the name of his Imperial Majesty and the city of Vienna,
I hereby arrest Edward Abramowitz.
also known as Eisenheim the Illusionist.
on charges of disturbing public order, charlatanism, and threats against the Empire.
leave him alone!
they're arresting him! They're arresting Eisenheim!
chief Inspector Uhl.
you're late.
my apologies, your Highness.
I was attending to the loose ends of the case.
are there still loose ends?
very few.
did he do it again?
how does he do it?
I'm afraid I still don't know.
did you ask him?
he's not talking at this point.
well, I'm sure you have methods for that kind of thing.
I want you to put an end to it. Surely you have something on him.
something from his past?
Yes. Yes, I think I do.
in fact we know all about his life.
we've spoken to almost everyone who ever knew him.
as a boy, I'm told he had a chance encounter with a traveling magician.
boy.
one version of the story was that the man himself then vanished along with the tree.
who knows what actually happened?
people began to think he had some kind of special power, or at least that he was a bit different.
and then he met her.
don't drop it.
careful, you're going to trip.
drop it, you muck-snipe.
Oh! Watch out for that hole, alley rat!
drop it!
pick a card. Put it back in the deck.
now, watch.
Duchess Von Teschen, you can't be in a place like this.
they're peasants. Remember who you are.
she was brought back to the castle and they were forbidden to see each other.
but soon they were doing just that.
over the next few years they could always find a way to be together.
quick, come on.
in China there's a magician that could make anything disappear.
a house, a wagon, anything.
we'll go visit him.
they can't stop us if we want to be together.
they'll never find us.
do you promise you'll take me with you?
one day I will.
one day we'll run away together. We'll disappear.
there's a secret way to open it.
I wanted a picture.
Sophie, are you there?
we must hurry! They're coming!
Duchess von Teschen!
Duchess von Teschen!
Duchess von Teschen!
make us disappear. Make us disappear.
Duchess von Teschen!
stop. Stop.
don't do this. Let me go. Let go.
No! Please, let go! No! Let her go, please!
let go! Stop it!
Sophie!
Eduard!
Sophie! -Eduard!
Sophie.
stay away from her or next time we'll arrest you and your family.
what happened next remains a mystery. We do know that he traveled the world.
that he began to perform his magic in public.
that he changed his name to Eisenheim.
and then almost fifteen years later he appeared in Vienna.
life and death, space and time, fate and chance.
these are the forces of the universe.
tonight, ladies and gentleman,
I present to you a man who has unlocked these mysteries.
from the furthest corners of the world where the dark arts still hold sway, he returns to us to demonstrate how nature's laws may be bent.
I give you... Eisenheim.
might I borrow a handkerchief from someone?
you, Madam.
thank you. Ah, be patient.
now, if you please, I would like to continue with an examination of time.
from the moment we enter this life we are in the flow of it.
we measure it and we mark it but we cannot defy it.
we cannot even speed it up or slow it down.
or can we?
have we not each experienced a sensation that a beautiful moment seemed to pass too quickly?
and wished that we could make it linger?
or felt time slow on a dull day and wished that we could speed things up a bit?
I assure you, they're quite real.
and you, Madam, where is your handkerchief?
Bravo! Very good.
give us something. Please, please, give us something.
please. -What's all this?
we're poor.
do you think you're poor?
Yes.
I want to show you something. You're not poor.
you have everything that you need right here.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you.
and that's yours. And this too.
good morning. -Good morning.
coffee? -No.
strudel? I have two.
nothing, thank you.
you look very pleased with yourself.
how are the receipts?
not bad. A three-quarter house.
well done.
but we're going to do better than that.
listen to this. Listen.
there is no argument that his uncanny displays separate him from the ranks of garden variety stage wizards.
some of his effects transcend mere illusion and approach the realm of art.
he is very young to be so masterful.
you see? We'll pack the house with this review.
we are going to make more money than you ever dreamed of.
but if it was mechanical, maybe he had it wrapped in some kind of bark?
Oh, yeah, of course I thought of that.
it's the butterflies I'm trying to work out.
Oh, for Pete's sake, invisible wire.
too obvious.
how many men have you detailed for tonight?
we have eight men inside, another eight out front.
perhaps you'll get another look at your butterflies.
check the last ten rows there.
you! Don't touch that! Put that down!
Ah, Herr Eisenheim.
who are you and what do you think you're doing?
I'm Chief Inspector Walter Uhl and I'm inspecting your theatre.
I've seen you perform.
very impressive. Very impressive.
how can we help you, Inspector?
you will be honored to know that the Crown Prince plans to attend your performance tonight.
the Crown Prince?
Yes! So, obviously we have to inspect the theatre.
I think that one's a bit small for an assassin, don't you?
Yes, the orange tree.
you know, I have seen things like this before but never one like that. Extraordinary.
thank you.
I have been puzzling over how it works, especially how the butterflies fly.
I assure you your secret is safe with me.
I'm an officer of the law after all, and a bit of an amateur conjourer.
are you really?
Yes. Well, card tricks, coins, uh, slight of hand, yes?
but nothing fancy. Perhaps you'll give me a tip?
Yes, all right. I'll show you one I'm very fond of.
are you a gambling man?
on occasion, yes.
I will bet you the secret of the orange tree that I can guess which hand you place this in every time.
excellent.
put it in your fist, raise your hand against your forehead, concentrate on it, form a mental picture.
Yes. -Have you got it? -Yes.
put your hands in front of you.
it's in your left.
well! -A lucky guess, perhaps.
you have a confederate who signals you.
no. It's more primitive than that.
Uh-huh.
when you raise your hand to your head, the blood drains from it.
it will be paler every time.
Oh, oh, I like that very much.
please take it with my compliments.
why, thank you. Eh, the blood drains.
now, Inspector, if you don't mind,
I've got to prepare for tonight's performance.
Ah.
please stand for his Imperial Highness, Crown Prince Leopold.
I thought we might end this evening with a discussion of the soul.
all of the greatest religions speak of the soul's endurance beyond the end of life.
so, what then does it mean to die?
I need a volunteer from the audience.
someone not afraid of death. Please, someone?
I assure you no tragedy will befall you.
it's an honor, Duchess Von Teschen.
do you know me?
no.
you're quite certain that we've never met before?
Yes, of course.
now please gaze directly into my eyes. Look nowhere else.
wave to yourself. Turn in a circle.
now, bow to yourself.
away.
they must have liked you.
they've waited for you nearly five minutes.
your Highness, may I introduce Eisenheim the Illusionist?
well done.
thank you for coming. I hope you enjoyed it.
Oh, we more than enjoyed it.
stimulated great debate amongst us, hasn't it?
except of course for your assistant, Duchess Von Teschen.
you seemed to have struck her quite speechless.
a feat in itself. Did you hypnotize her?
in a fashion.
I'd like to learn that trick.
Rainier here thinks you have supernatural powers.
do you claim supernatural powers?
I've never said anything of that kind.
then you won't mind a question or two.
now let's not ruin it.
you needn't divulge anything I can't guess.
as you wish.
your assistants are behind a mirror somewhere in robes obviously.
lights in the frame perhaps to illuminate them, or angled mirrors?
that would be one way to do it.
I think I understand it all except the ghost.
that was very, very good.
another viewing perhaps?
you must come to the Hofburg next time. We'll make an evening of it.
that will be my pleasure.
so be it. Sophie?
and we'll gather our best minds next time. You'll really have a challenge then.
then I'll prepare something special. Perhaps I'll make you disappear.
Oh, my God, when he volunteered her I heard the crashing sound of money falling on me in piles.
every lady of means in Vienna will want to get up there with you now.
what a showoff.
his father would have died if he had seen such a display.
she didn't seem too happy about it either.
well, she'd better get used to it.
how's that? -Word is she'll marry him soon.
Really? -Taking her chances if you ask me.
Why?
he likes to give his lady friends a good thrashing now and again.
people say he pushed one of them off a balcony just to cover the beating he had given her.
for Herr Eisenheim.
Hello, Sophie.
when I was on the stage, you knew me right away.
it took me a moment but, yes, I knew.
you could have said something.
I thought you'd figure it out eventually.
Yes, I would have.
I would have come another night, volunteered, walked right on stage and said hello.
and then you'd really have had to move quickly.
I suspect you would have.
I don't understand why.
perhaps for the same reasons you find it prudent to meet in a carriage.
it's just a game I have to play with them.
I'm followed everywhere.
it's-it's supposed to be for my protection.
Yes. So, I hear congratulations are in order.
what for?
they say you'll be the princess.
it's not decided at all.
Ah.
it makes a certain sense, I suppose.
we've known each other for years and of course our families.
he's very intelligent. A little too intelligent for his own good.
you're lucky, you know. To have broken free as you did.
I often wish that I had...
wished what?
I wished that I would see you again.
and now you have.
Yes, now I have.
I look forward to seeing you again at the Hofburg.
until then.
here's the report on Duchess Von Teschen.
Mmm. Anything interesting?
see for yourself.
the magician?
they drove around for half an hour, then he got out near the theatre.
what do you want us to do?
join us for a drink?
please.
you like something to eat, something to drink, mmm?
no, thank you.
Herr Eisenheim, I'm going to ask you a question that may not seem friendly.
but I assure you, in fact, is.
what is your relationship with the Duchess Von Teschen?
you're right, that doesn't seem friendly.
Oh, but that is precisely my point.
for, you see, where others might judge a discreet carriage ride for what it seemed to be, I am willing to find out what it actually was.
all right. We were childhood acquaintances.
acquaintances?
childhood friends. My father was a cabinetmaker.
he made the furniture for her family's house.
I see, the cabinet maker's son friends with a...
has there been a complaint?
Oh, no, no.
if there'd been a complaint...
well, we'd be having a very, uh, different sort of conversation.
Yes. He relies on you for that sort of thing, does he?
I'm a simple public servant, Herr Eisenheim.
that's not what I hear.
I hear you'll be the Chief of Police very soon.
maybe Mayor of Vienna? Party Secretary?
all subject to his whim.
you better hope he doesn't dissolve the Parliament before you get there.
now, the Prince has some progressive ideas, but he will make a fine Emperor.
well, they say you're very close to him, so I'm sure you'll be fine.
look-- Yes, indeed, they say that I'm very close to the Prince.
but the simple truth of the matter is, Herr Eisenheim,
I'm the son of a butcher.
he's the heir to the Empire.
how close could we be to such as him, Hmm?
do you see my point?
don't fool yourself that you can play in their game.
I've served on the edge of it for many, many years and I can tell you with certainty there's no trick they haven't seen.
it's not worth it.
my guest tonight is not a showman at all, but rather a wizard who has sold his soul to the devil in return for unholy powers.
or so at least some of our friends here would have us believe.
but fear not, everything can and will be explained.
all mysteries penetrated.
here, Here. Well said. Well said.
is that the emperor?
Ah, yes, your father.
I didn't think he was invited.
a fair likeness of the old man.
too modern a style for him, of course.
I'm afraid I'm not much of a painter.
it's true, there are no brush strokes in this painting,
I can see that clearly.
so to achieve the color some sort of chemical must be interacting, presumably.
some sort of sprayer up your sleeve? May I?
if you feel you must.
I do.
Oh, let the man do his show.
you want me to just sit there when it's so obvious?
I do.
he tries to trick you. I try to enlighten you.
which is the more noble pursuit?
may we have the lights please, so his Highness can better see?
see here, Leopold, let's have a show.
here, here.
come on, Leopold, get on with it.
very well, I propose a challenge.
why don't you astonish us, if you can, without all the gadgetry?
as you wish.
your sword is very beautiful. Might I see it?
certainly.
may I?
where does power flow from?
skill or destiny, or divine right?
we all know the story of a sword called Excalibur.
Excalibur's blade was fixed in stone, and there it stayed.
many worthy knights tried to pull the sword from the stone.
only Arthur succeeded proving his right to rule.
who can take this sword? You sir, can you take the sword?
no surprise there.
perhaps you, sir.
not so eager, cousin.
you shall live a long life.
thank you for your indulgence.
come now, if you can't pull it out you'll never be Emperor.
your father will live to be a hundred.
the sword to its rightful owner!
that's enough light entertainment for this evening.
for more serious discussion, please join me for a drink.
shut him down.
well, he's very popular, your Highness.
I'm sure you'll find a way.
what did you do to him?
I gave him what he asked for.
what would possess you to do something so foolish?
Duchess Von Teschen, you must come along, my dear.
we don't want to keep the Prince waiting. Did you enjoy the show?
it was wonderful, wasn't it?
it was amusing.
who told you where to find me?
your manager.
I told him if he wants to stay in Vienna, you need my help.
Ah, so I'm to be driven from the city, is that it?
good, I shall relish it.
stop it! I came here to try to help you.
why! Why should you possibly care what happens to me now?
you were my friend. I am your friend.
we knew each other very briefly a long time ago.
you don't know me at all.
then why did you speak to me? Why did you even bother talking
and you kept it all this time.
I used to sit and stare at your picture trying to imagine where you were.
at night I'd have dreams I had gone with you, and then I'd wake up and realize where I was.
but in my dreams you had shorter hair and no beard.
where did you go when you left?
to my uncle's farm near Prague.
how exotic.
I went to Russia, then Asia Minor, and then the Orient for many years.
so long.
I always meant to return.
I just- I kept thinking I'd find it around the next corner.
what?
a real mystery.
I saw remarkable things, but the only mystery
I never solved was why my heart couldn't let go of you.
he wants me to go to Budapest with him next week to announce our engagement.
he wants the Hungarians behind him. They're going to crown him King.
I'm sure his father will have something to say about that.
he plans to overthrow his father.
that could go very badly for him... and for you.
you shouldn't be involved.
I am part of his plan.
he only gets Hungary by aligning himself with my family.
leave him.
it's not that easy.
call it off and come away with me.
or don't say anything and we'll just go.
as long as we are alive he'll hunt us.
and when he finds us he'll kill us.
look at me. Do you truly want to leave with me?
Yes, I do.
there you are. As I predicted they shut us down.
are you happy now, hmm? You made your point.
it doesn't matter that we were sold out for the whole run.
no, look. You got it off your chest.
do we have money?
what?
do we have any money saved?
Yes, we have some. But we could have had much, much more.
Mmm, it will have to do.
and the second account, all of it.
of course, Herr Eisenheim.
thank you.
and you have no doubt it was Duchess Von Teschen?
I'd stake my life on it.
what was in the suitcase?
I don't know.
he's by the first car.
the map will show you where to meet.
when it's done, you'll travel ahead with her and I shall follow.
and she understands everything this entails?
completely. There's not a lot of time.
as you know, we sometimes follow Duchess Von Teschen for her protection.
yesterday she was seen in the company of another man.
what man?
Eisenheim, the Illusionist.
what were they doing?
well, they were meeting and, uh
touching? Kissing? Were they fucking?
not that we observed, no.
however, I have reason to believe that they may be planning something together.
it's possible they may be leaving.
I'm not certain of anything yet, your Highness.
thank you, Inspector.
we can of course acquire more information.
he spent the afternoon in Vienna with his father.
he's expected shortly.
what a surprise. I thought you didn't like it here.
I suppose you think you're very clever and very democratic in your friendships, aren't you?
what are you talking about?
your magician friend. I know you've been with him.
it's true. We've been friends since childhood.
you sleep with all your childhood friends?
I will not be spoken to this way.
you'll be spoken to as I wish to speak to you.
you're drunk.
you're getting quite old, aren't you?
you know, my mother was sixteen years old when she married my father.
and you? Can you even bear children?
are you any use at all? Are you trying to embarrass me?
it has nothing to do with you.
it has everything to do with me!
you will not share my bed if you've slept with him!!
you don't understand. I'm not going to share your bed at all.
I'm not going to Budapest with you.
I don't want to be part of what you're planning.
and I will not marry you.
I assume you haven't been so stupid as to tell him anything.
cause if you disrupt my plans,
I will have no further use for you, do you understand?
now, you will travel to Budapest tomorrow.
I recommend that you are here early packed and ready to go.
do nothing more to embarrass me.
goodbye.
what do you mean "goodbye"?
come back here.
come back here!
don't disobey me again. Whore!
out of my way. Please, don't-- Uugh.
no, leave that. Leave all the lanterns.
Duchess Von Tuschen!
Duchess Von Tuschen!
over here!
I thought you saw her get on the train with him!
no, sir, we were waiting in Vienna for them.
but they left from Barden? We assumed she was him.
should I wire the Crown Prince in Budapest?
it's been done! Who are you?
I'm the family's doctor. Are you the Chief Inspector?
Yes, I am.
you understand this is a police matter now?
of course I understand.
good, good.
you have determined the cause of death?
she bled to death.
there's a wound on her throat just above the left collarbone.
uh, some knife or sword.
may I take a look?
inspector, l-I will not stand for it.
the Crown Prince will not stand for it. This is not some circus sideshow.
my apologies, of course.
thank you, doctor.
probably robbed. Gypsies maybe?
saw all those diamonds, couldn't say no.
chief Inspector, there's one thing you should know.
Yes, what is that?
in the folds of her dress I found this small gemstone.
seen last Thursday at 7: 30 p. m. riding without an escort toward the Imperial Hunting Lodge.
groomsman said she arrived about 8: 30.
what was she doing riding alone?
he did this. You know he did.
I know who did what?
the Crown Prince! He killed her. He's done it before and you know it!
no, I don't know that. In fact, I'm sure he didn't. He's in Budapest.
he killed her before he left.
I'm afraid the facts don't support your theory.
she was leaving him.
for who? You? Yes.
don't be absurd, Herr Eisenheim.
he killed her because he couldn't let her go.
she knew his secret.
what secret?
ask your Inspector. He knows.
stop this right now!
are you completely corrupt?
no, not completely, no, which is why I'll advise you not to accuse anyone especially his Imperial Highness, or you'll end up in jail yourself.
Where's the guard who let her out of the gate?
gone with the Crown Prince.
did any of the servants see her leave?
all asleep.
what about him?
he uh, he put her horse in the first stall when she arrived.
this one?
we don't have jurisdiction on imperial property.
thank you. I know.
so, what are you doing?
investigating.
listening to that magician, are you? For all we know, he did it.
no, I think not.
the Crown Prince-- He's back.
chief Inspector, we should go. Now.
and what have you found out?
she was last seen riding here alone.
Yes, and based on your information I then threw her out, Chief?
did she commit suicide?
no, it was surely murder.
do you have a suspect?
we will soon, your Highness.
later that week, we arrested a man and charged him with murder.
but I knew that that wouldn't satisfy Eisenheim.
I had my men continue to watch him.
he finally emerged from his grief and bought a rundown theatre.
it's perfect.
he fired his manager and began preparing for a new kind of show.
who is he?
my name is Frankel.
where did you come from?
I come from Brunn. My father is a lens grinder there.
how did you come to be here tonight?
I don't know.
are you alive?
what can you tell us about the other side?
what's it like?
Yes, tell us.
you must know things, secret things.
they don't seem to think it's a trick.
Eisenheim's audience had always been enthusiastic.
but now he was attracting a more impassioned following.
Madame, please.
with these spirts, these manifestations,
Eisenheim has given us hard proof of the soul's immortality.
a spirit has been reaffirmed in the face of modern scientific materialism.
the work of spiritualism will arouse humanity to a new moral earnestness.
it is a revolutionary movement and we will turn the empire into a spiritual republic.
do you think Eisenheim's behind all this?
why must I be bothered with a magician?
he has proven to be more than a magician, your Highness.
he is a charlatan. He's a faker.
if he pretends to have supernatural I powers put him on trial for fraud.
first we have to show it as fraud then do it find out how the trick is done and then arrest him.
this is just a rough demonstration, Inspector.
but you can see how it could work.
Yes, I see. Not bad. Not bad.
we need a spy in Eisenheim's troop.
those Orientals, they won't give us anything.
I already tried.
then try something else.
what has happened here?
one of those ghosts from the theatre, down the street.
where!
right there, and it's a boy.
sick.
where is this thing?
over there.
did you see it?
it was right over there.
where are you taking him?
I want to know how it's done.
first the orange tree, now this.
do I have to share all my professional secrets with the police?
well, in this case, yes. Or I'll be forced to arrest you.
on what charge?
Mmm, well, we'll start with fraud.
excuse me, Chief Inspector.
what!
I think you should look outside the window.
who are they?
they are here for him.
Ah, my goodness, you have a devoted following.
what is it they expect of you?
I have no idea. What do your spies tell you?
that you plan to separate? the monarchy perhaps?
Why?
just because the Crown Prince is a murderer?
he's not a murderer.
we have the real murderer in prison. He pleaded guilty.
you've got the wrong man.
you don't know that.
no, but you do.
Herr Eisenheim, you will also go to prison if you don't explain to me what it is you are doing.
the sentence will be greater if that mob attacks the building.
well?
what are you doing? Stop! Stop!
listen to me, please. You must listen to me, please.
thank you all for coming.
I've been speaking with the Chief Inspector, and I think there's been a serious misunderstanding.
I want you all to know that everything that you have seen in my theatre is an illusion.
it's a trick. It's not real.
I can't bring loved ones back from the grave.
I can't receive messages from the other side.
I apologize if I've given you any false hope.
my intention has only been to entertain.
nothing more.
now I appreciate your support, but you must go home.
please, you must go.
there, now I've explained it. So it can't be fraud. May I go?
has he tricked you? Is that it?
no, your Highness.
then why are you failing me?
I thought I could trust you.
I thought you were a man I could bring with me when I took the throne.
am I wrong about you?
no. You're not wrong, your Highness, no.
I need men who can complete the tasks assigned to them!!
instead I'm surrounded by fools.
in the end I must do everything myself.
I can see this case will be no different.
how do I look?
ordinary, your Highness, very ordinary.
I think I'm going to enjoy this.
they don't recognize you.
good. Now keep your distance. I don't want to be seen with a policeman.
who are you?
are you Duchess Von Teschen?
Yes.
what's happened to you?
she was murdered. Were you murdered?
by who? Did they arrest the right man?
tell us, please. Who murdered you?
someone... here.
tell us, point him out. Was it the Crown Prince?
he's killed a woman before!
word? the Crown Prince isn't even here.
the Crown Prince killed her! Something must be done!
chief Inspector, are you sure you have the right man?
quite sure. Excuse me.
did you investigate the Crown Prince?
he cannot continue if this is true. He must be brought to justice.
it's not true, the magic trick is not evidence. What is your name?
I don't see how that matters.
I advise you to watch what you say, sir.
that actress didn't even look like Sophie.
but the audience is stupid and he knows it.
he manipulates them. He himself said nothing.
his actress said nothing inflammatory.
he left it to the audience to make their accusations.
all taunts paid for by him, of course.
I don't suppose you made a note of those people?
I'm afraid we didn't have enough men tonight.
at the next performance I want them all arrested, every one of them-Eisenheim and the whole troupe.
I want to have an example made of him in front of all his followers.
that was very foolish last night. You can't destroy him, you know.
you can't bring down the monarchy.
Oh, I know I can't.
then don't raise her again! Don't provoke those questions.
Herr Eisenheim, I don't want to arrest you.
I'm a cynical man, God knows.
but if your manifestations are somehow real,
and even I'm willing to admit you're a very special person, and if it's a trick then it's equally impressive.
either way you have a gift, so don't make me put you in jail.
promise me you won't do it again.
I promise you, you'll enjoy this next show.
what do you want?
nothing.
then why bring her back?
just to be with her.
to be with her.
everything is ready? -Yes, sir.
we're trying to assess how he might escape.
he will not escape! I want guards at every door and window!
sir.
I want to apologize to you for my behavior of late.
but I want to make it up to you if you'll listen to a proposition.
well, I don't know.
I'll make it worth your while, Josef.
you know, I'm very busy right now.
I haven't just been sitting around waiting for you.
no, no, of course.
I want you to assume control of all my finances and my assets.
everything.
everything?
Yes, including this theatre and all the receipts from tonight's performance, which I offer with my sincere thanks.
what do you say?
all right, I'll do it.
good. Good.
would you like me to introduce you tonight?
no. Tonight just enjoy the show.
excuse me, Chief Inspector, I'm Josef Fischer, Eisenheim's manager.
Yes, I remember.
what's going on? Why all the police?
precautions, Herr Fischer, precautions.
are you planning to arrest Eisenheim?
that's entirely up to him.
it's Duchess Von Teschen.
why were you murdered?
I was leaving him.
leaving who?
the Crown Prince?
of course it was the Crown Prince.
we won't stand for it!
I tried to get away.
I was wearing my locket when I died but now it's gone.
it's lost.
tell us, please, who murdered you?
was it the Crown Prince?
we must do something!
get up!
in the name of his Imperial Majesty and the city of Vienna,
I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovitz, also known as Eisenheim the Illusionist, on charges of disturbing public order, charlatanism, and threats against the empire!
find him!
where is he?
he was right there.
how is his trick done? -No trick.
how is it done!
I don't know. Nobody knows.
dammit!
I had my driver take the sword to police headquarters.
my men will examine it and see if it matches the gemstone found on Duchess Von Teschen's body.
I have no doubt that it will.
and after that, I came in here and you asked me why I was late.
you've stolen Imperial property.
that seems trivial compared with murder.
even if that were true, you have no jurisdiction here.
that's right.
you may do as you wish here without consequence.
nobody can punish you, except one man.
who's that?
the Emperor.
I don't suppose he'll leave his crown to a murderer, do you?
he'll never believe you.
maybe not.
but I wrote a letter to his general staff telling them everything.
including your plan to overthrow the Emperor.
I know they'll listen to that.
you'll not take the throne, not with my help.
you no longer want to be Chief of Police?
mayor of Vienna?
you don't want to be a baron, an aristocrat?
I'm afraid that's out of the question at this point.
you fool, he's tricking you. He's manipulating you.
he had the sword at the command performance.
he could have pried the stones loose then and planted them here.
he's planted everything. -You were drunk.
it's all a trick. It's an illusion.
perhaps there's truth in this illusion.
you need to wire your driver and have the sword returned.
or what?
I'll shoot you. Perhaps I'll shoot you anyway.
and then you'll have killed a police inspector and a Duchess.
or perhaps you'll kill yourself.
you, uh, committed suicide, distraught at having failed your leader.
Ah, some officers of the general staff I'd guess.
they must've received my letter.
what do you want?
I don't want anything.
fine. Fine. You shall have nothing.
gentlemen.
the situation is so obvious.
everyone's completely incompetent.
my father runs the Empire into the ground and no one notices.
no one does anything about it.
I propose to clean up the mess and you thank me by betraying me.
well, you're all becoming irrelevant. You'll all be replaced.
the country will be run by mongrels.
a thousand different voices screaming to be heard and nothing will be done!
nothing!
I've done everything I can!
too much! Far too much.
your Highness, are you in there? Your Highness, open door.
please, open the door.
by your father's authority I insist you open the door.
you must open the door!
you're all fools...
please, your Highness.
and I can't stand it. I won't stand it.
break down the door. Break it down!
what happened?
the Crown Prince just shot himself.
are you Chief Inspector Uhl?
I used to be.
you! Who gave you this! Who gave you this!
herr, Eisenheim!
when!
all aboard!
tickets and papers.
all aboard!
when it's done...
you'll travel ahead with her and I shall follow.
and she understands everything this entails?
completely.
do you think Eisenheim's behind all this?
so, what does it mean to die?
what do you want?
to be with her.
to be with her.
chief Inspector, there's one thing you should know.
your sword is very beautiful. Might I see it?
you're drunk.
you were drunk.
he's a charlatan and he's a faker.
he's plotted everything.
everything you have seen is an illusion.
it's a trick.
the Invisible
it wasn't easy...
...when Nick's father died, raising a teenager alone.
but, with a boy like Nick, well, he is... now...
...everything a mother could want.
we've been through some hard times.
we've carried each other.
now I look to the future, and I know there's nothing that we can't do together.
thank you.
go on, open it.
turn it over.
to Nick, from Mother. Make me proud.
so, to us.
to us, all.
Cheers.
around the table.
you look pale.
how would you know?
are you taking the Valerian Root I got you?
Mom...Finals are next week.
mom?
what?
have you... thought about it?
about what? - The writer's course?
London? - I don't need to think about it.
you know how I feel. Why do we keep bringing this up?
what is that?
irony?
what's up, dude?
you got it?
Thanks, man.
you just saved my ass.
pleasure doing business with you.
you want to know what it says?
when am I going to speak French?
Hey, caught you.
are you coming to Ava's party tomorrow?
I can't. I'm busy.
busy? School's almost out.
whatever.
come on.
what's he got? - Nothing.
not a dime.
unbelievable.
NIC gum.
and a pack.
you wearing the patch, too?
kind of a mixed message, Pete.
like the fact that you accepted merchandise from me...
...and still haven't paid for it.
I'll get your money, please!
got money for this crap, but not for me?
no, please! I'll get your money! Please!
don't be such a baby. It's just a scratch.
see you soon.
she sits up and cries
a sigh
long thighs
gotta fly
love you, baby A lie
Why?
Jimmy, you wrote that?
Yes, ma'am.
OK, then. Thanks.
Nicholas, let's see if you can top that.
please.
it still needs some work.
it always needs work, get used to it.
day burns down to night
burns the edge of my soul
in the night
I break into sparks of suns
and become fire's end The dust of bones
night knifes my breath Swallows whole my tongue
turn back reverse return
in the night I see the real
concealed in the day's bright lie
eyes stitched shut
white teeth smile
sleep walks
and talks and feet mark time...
OK, I know it's party week, but it's finals, too.
Hey.
Hey. Don't look at me like that. I needed a new phone.
so go buy one at RadioShack.
are you serious? You know my dad.
he gives me no cash. - You gotta stand up for yourself, man.
don't let them push you around like that.
that's easy for you to say, because when you talk, people listen.
when I talk, you listen. That's about it.
I can't, man. OK? I can't.
Hey, Nick, come on. Dude, stop it, stop.
come on, Nick.
damn it.
OK...
how much does my friend owe you?
is that enough?
disappear, asshole.
you are so broken.
what are you looking at?
no. Nothing. I'm just...
...more of a Grover guy, that's all.
you're so polite.
the whole "golden boy" thing, right?
except it's not really you. I mean, I know you sell essays.
you're no better than me.
you're right. I'm a total hypocrite.
anybody want to explain?
she...
...finds me irresistible.
all right. Newton, I'm not gonna suspend you. I know the game.
just go home today, be back here tomorrow.
try decaf.
what are you doing, Nick?
wasting your time on a lost soul like Annie Newton?
she has no future. You do.
don't let us down.
can I leave now?
Hey, Annie.
Where's dinner?
Hey, Victor. Are you hungry?
see?
get your bony ass out of this chair right now and make him something to eat.
you can't talk to me like that.
I just did.
just gonna leave? - What do you want? I got night shift.
say something to her.
it's a little food. You got nothing else to do all day.
you wanna fight, then? Is that what you want to do?
Yeah. - You wanna get into this now?
discipline your kids, for God's sake.
you don't tell me what to do.
take some responsibility for your kids.
why won't you talk to her?
my main responsibility...
Annie, you going out tonight?
Annie? Annie!
you're leaving?
later. I'll be back.
I'll be back.
Hey.
it's from Seb and Tash.
they need those... translations by tomorrow morning.
Yeah, they're done.
so, you got beat up by a girl. - Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.
Yeah, don't want to talk about it, huh?
so, are we gonna go to Ava's party tomorrow night?
party.
I'm not gonna be here tomorrow night.
ticket and baggage information.
London? - Yeah.
the Royal Academy writer's program.
Really?
no, you're graduating next week, you can't go.
I have enough credits to graduate. - Oh, my God.
London?
London? - Yeah.
wait, does your mom know? - No.
but she will, when I'm gone.
she just... she won't get it. You know, she doesn't get it.
Yeah. - There's no other way.
do you remember when my dad died?
the first thing that she said to me was, "Don't worry about it, Nick. This won't change a thing for you.
you know, I'm like, 13, right. All I wanna do is cry.
she's thinking about my future?
she's always had it mapped out.
you know, I stay here, I might as well retire and die.
I mean, my dad didn't even get to retire.
he was 46 when he got sick.
I'm not gonna let her do that to me.
Hey, baby girl.
you ready?
always.
hey...
Hey! Don't even think about it, all right?
they're still inside, that's why they haven't cleared the window.
hey... hey, what the hell are you doing?
no, no. Annie, no!
goddamn it, Annie!
goddamn it.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yeah, nice work, Annie.
Jesus Christ.
you just invited the cops to a fuckin' auto theft!
fuckin' retard!
you always expect me to just stand around?
you're getting more and more out of control.
what time is it? - Go back to sleep.
leave the bag. I'll take care of it. - Sure you will.
you gonna shop it around at school? It's not like cell phones.
what, I can't make a little money on the side?
what for? College?
I'll figure it out.
leave the bag.
what are you gonna do, Marcus? - Leave the bag, Annie.
nothing.
nothing?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you!
nothing?
nothing.
police Department. Can I help you?
Marcus? Marcus!
Marcus. - They found the stuff. I got busted.
what did you tell them? - Nothing. You think I'm an idiot?
police Department. How may I direct your call?
I'm out on OR. I got a court date in a couple weeks.
any idea how they found out? - Yeah. An idea.
I'll take care of it myself.
Hey, Nick? - Yeah?
I wanna leave, too, man. - Why?
Why? Why?
cause I'd be the foreigner. I'd be American, I have the accent.
what are you gonna do in London?
I'll be a cricket star. You know, those dudes with mallets?
I think that's polo. - I'd be a polo star.
you didn't have money to afford a cell phone, how are you gonna get a ticket?
you have a passport? - No.
I need someone to write to, man.
OK. All right. Good luck.
I love you, man.
I love you, too.
take care of yourself, man.
don't look back, baby. - Don't look back.
the airline called.
your flight's been changed.
I can explain, Mom. - Can you?
can you, really?
I tried to talk to you. - Why bother?
you've had this ticket for weeks.
you were planning to go no matter what I said.
my God, Nicholas.
you were just going to leave tonight without saying a word?
I feel like I've been living in this house with a stranger.
I swear I didn't do it, OK?
you were watching me.
it wasn't me.
you were watching me by the lockers.
I didn't do it. - Then who did?
I don't know, I swear, I don't know!
please stop!
no, no!
get back here. - No! No! Don't!
how's your hand, Pete? How's your hand, Pete!
huh?
OK!
I'll tell you, OK?
I'll tell you!
thought you were too busy to come.
you wanna go to London?
you wanna go to London?
seriously.
flight leaves in two hours.
then we'd better hurry up.
what would she think of us right now?
your mom.
hmm?
Wow.
that's a nice watch.
so why are you still wearing that beat up, old thing?
my dad gave it to me.
wouldn't he want you to have a better watch?
it was my dad's.
what are you doing?
have a good time.
Hey, where you off to?
come on, man. You gonna fight back?
I can't watch this.
please, tell them to stop.
shut up. - Please, tell them to stop.
please, tell them to stop.
think you're so smart?
gonna cry? Why don't you cry?
come on, you little baby. Look at me!
get the hell up!
come on, man. Fight back.
get off.
no.
how do you like that? - Stop it!
do you feel good about yourself now? Now that you turned me in, huh?
I didn't know... You were supposed to be on a plane, Nick!
he can't hear you, idiot.
you're so damn perfect.
Annie, Annie. That's enough. Look at him.
stop. Just stop. - Get off of me!
who's the broken one, now? - You are.
it's still you.
come on, come on.
still you.
What'd you say? - Still you.
What'd you...?
Oh, jeez.
he's not breathing. - Aw, man!
what the hell, Annie! What did you do that for?
what did you do? What did you do? - Shut up. Shut up!
what did you do? - I am not going to jail for this!
Oh! - Now we have to pick him up.
I'm not picking him up. - Pick him up!
just keep moving.
we gotta get further into the woods.
we know, we got it! - Just come.
just keep moving.
come on, get in here.
open up.
open up! - Oh, Christ.
what the hell happened to you?
I killed him.
what did you say?
I killed him. - Killed who?
nicholas Powell, the kid who sold me out.
it got all screwed up. What am I gonna do?
why the hell did you come here, Annie?
Jesus Christ! You know I'm on parole, Annie!
why'd you come here?
I need an alibi, Marcus.
what did I say to you, huh?
you're way out of control.
you should've listened to me. Now get out.
get out!
don't touch that.
stolen.
stolen...
...stolen, stolen, stolen.
stolen, stolen...
...stolen!
I knew I could count on you.
guess you didn't use the ticket, huh?
I don't even know where he went.
see, they return.
Ah, see the tentative movements and the slow feet
trouble in the pace and the uncertain wavering
anyone?
come on, guys. We did this poem three days ago.
Ezra Pound? - No one?
Hello?
it's Ezra Pound, The Return. - No one?
Ezra Pound. You guys are killing me.
OK. Discussion.
poems we heard in last class.
Jimmy. - Nick Powell's poem.
I mean, I didn't get it. How does sleep talk?
it's a metaphor. - It doesn't even rhyme.
what's your problem? - It's pretentious.
Nick's always trying to make himself important.
I think Powell has serious issues.
whatever, it sucked. - I liked it.
is this a game?
you guys playing a game? Think this is funny?
Hello!
anybody?
Hello!
Hello! Hello!
Hello? Hello! Can anybody hear me?
Hey, guys. Guys.
let's talk about this when Nick gets back to class, shall we?
come on, Mom, answer the phone.
answer the phone.
Oh, I'm sorry. I just had to use the phone.
Hello?
nicholas Powell?
no, he must be in class right now, Mrs. Powell.
Yeah, just a minute. I'll have someone go check if he's here.
hold on, please.
I'm sorry, detective, what was that?
mom... can you hear me? - He left the house last night at 7: 00.
he's never stayed out all night without calling me.
I just... I have a bad feeling about this.
mom!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
you saw me.
you were at the window and you saw me.
I need your help. Can you help me?
I know you can see me.
you'll never be seen again.
they... can't hear you anymore.
they can't touch you.
you don't exist.
no.
no. No.
Hello, hello!
Hello? - Oh, thank God.
is that better? Can you hear me?
I said 18 year old, white male, name's Nicholas Powell.
possible missing persons case.
what are you looking for, detective?
my son is missing and you're in here.
what exactly are you doing?
looking for anything to help find Nick.
I mean, I could fill out a report, give it 24 hours, but...
that's not what I do...
not when a kid's involved.
I don't know.
you know if Nick used drugs or sold them?
no. Of course not.
what can you tell me about him?
he's very well liked. He's bright. He's very bright.
he's very bright.
I mean, who is he, really?
as a person?
you have my number if there's anything.
detective?
I found a plane ticket... for London.
did you call the airline? - He missed the flight.
he wasn't on it.
I wouldn't worry too much, Mrs. Powell.
he's only been gone the one night.
no. Something is wrong.
he... he wouldn't. I know him.
you didn't know about the plane ticket.
mom. I'm dead.
we need to get a search party up here.
comb these woods. - Yeah, I spoke with the principal.
Nick had a run in yesterday with a girl at school.
sorry. Newton. Annie Newton.
something I should know?
Jack.
we're here to talk to Annie.
she's on the roof.
some history there?
he used to be a cop.
what happened?
it's a long story.
I knew Annie when she was just a baby.
she liked my ties.
Hey, kiddo. What's up?
what do you want now?
nice. You know, you asked me to marry you once.
another lifetime.
I guess so.
what did you do last night, Annie?
I don't remember. - She was busy cracking my skull.
happen to run into Nicholas Powell?
who? - Why not ask her why she killed me.
we know you had a problem with him. - Do I know you?
someone called to turn you in yesterday.
you knew that. Think it was Nicholas?
what? - I was with my boyfriend, Marcus.
Marcus know this? - Ask him.
they found something by the woods. Putting together a search party, so...
so... I have some homework to do.
you'll have to excuse me.
I'll let you get to it. - Mm-hmm.
no more questions? You bought that?
I can't believe this.
you killed me because you thought I called the police on you?
was she a sweet baby? - Everybody has a story.
you bitch!
be careful, you'll break it.
why can't I fly it on the roof? - Because it's not safe.
don't pretend you're a human being. - Come on, please.
I'll take you to the park sometime. The one by the bluffs?
when? - Sometime.
I'm just a little busy right now. - Hey, Annie.
what's gonna happen to you? - Nothing to worry about, little man.
Hey, Pete. There's a search party in the woods. I want you there.
I don't care.
Oh, my God, this is a nightmare.
shit!
go slowly, keep together, pay attention.
if you find something, call one of the officers.
try not to disturb the area.
OK. Let's get to it.
set your radios on channel three.
tell them to go south. - Nicholas!
Nick!
Nicholas!
Nick Powell!
Nick!
Nick Powell! Can you hear us?
Nick!
day burns down to night
burns the edge of my soul
in the night I break into sparks of suns
and become fire's end
the dust of bones
in the night I see the real
concealed in the day's bright lie
eyes stitched shut
white teeth smile
sleep walks
and talks
Oh, jeez.
I'm alive.
shit. I'm alive.
Nick Powell!
Nick!
Nick! - Here! I'm right here!
Hey, I'm over here!
here I am, right here. Come here, boy.
good boy.
come here, come here, buddy. This way, come here.
good boy!
good boy! - Hey, wait. You see me, don't you?
come here.
good boy, come here. Good boy. - Nicholas!
to Nicholas, From Mother." Got something here!
good boy, you can see me, yeah!
no, no! Wrong way!
that way! I think he's onto something. - No! Wait, don't go!
Nick!
Nicholas!
Pete.
why was Annie calling you?
they'll find him.
it just takes some time, you know? I mean, I...
...I was literally right there when they found the watch.
you were right there and they didn't find the body.
nobody knows but us, so?
what are you so afraid of?
I can't take this. I'm going to the police.
you go to the police, you go to jail.
no.
I won't. It was you.
you were right there and you didn't do a thing.
you're in as deep as we are.
Pete, I'm still alive out there.
Pete...
Pete!
they know you did it and they'll keep coming back.
don't think you can run, Annie, 'cause they'll get you.
Hey, Annie.
I have to go away for a little while.
are you gonna go away and never come back, like Mom?
go on, Annie, tell him.
here.
I want you to keep this for me. - I don't want it.
it was Mom's. - I know.
you need it more than I do.
you're pretty great. - Yeah, I know.
come here, little man.
do you know what I want more than anything?
don't be like me.
I ruin everything I touch.
OK?
one day, if I'm lucky, maybe I'll get to do one good thing.
make you proud of me.
how'd you get in here?
everybody's out there looking for you.
you listening to me?
I want you out of here. - No problem. I'm gone.
just know...
...if anything happens to Victor...
...I will come back here, and I will kill you.
whatever you've done, I want no part of it.
so, your mom's gone, your dad married somebody else, you all hate each other, does that give you an excuse?
does that make it OK?
well, you know what?
don't think about blaming anyone but yourself.
Annie, this is your fault!
goddamn it, Annie! I'm still alive!
tell them where my body is!
Oh, that's right! You can't hear me.
you can't hear me, Annie.
Burnaby Police are not offering any information at this point.
we do know forensics are on the scene.
however, night has fallen and with rain in the city...
what's our time frame if he's out there alive?
it depends on his injuries. I'd say two, three days, tops.
all right.
nice shop. - We're closed, man.
you only work on the old cars? - No.
what about you work on, say, an '03?
sure thing, man. Come back tomorrow, I'll sort you out, all right?
Hey, I know you. You're Marcus Bohem.
you go out with Annie Newton, right?
Yeah, that's right.
you seen her lately?
no. Well, I see her sometimes.
hmm. Open relationship.
you see her on Tuesday night? - Yeah, I was with her.
school night. - Yeah.
because Monday night she got busted for a smash-and-grab at a jewelry store.
you know, and they took a car the same time.
and so, you weren't with her that night?
I don't know anything about that. - Good. That's good.
no, but she phoned you from the police station.
right, but I wasn't with her that night, you see?
OK.
how long has it been?
hmm.
I've been on parole eight months with a clean record.
you can check with my PO. - I already did.
OK.
you see Annie, you tell her I want to talk to her.
about a missing person at her school.
know anything about it?
no.
2003 Mercedes S500.
car that got stolen.
keep an eye out for me.
Yeah, well, let's see where he takes us.
don't worry about it, Mom.
this won't change a thing for you.
you got everything all under control, right?
you always had your... your fingers in everything.
you know, fingering through this house.
me, my room.
don't! Don't feel a thing, Mom!
you don't want to ruin your face, your pretty face!
I'm out there in the mud!
I'm dying, Mom, and you're sitting here with your briefs and your herbal tea and your books!
I wish you could see me right now, Mom!
so you know how sick I am of you!
I am sick of you and your perfect world!
I am sick of you 'cause it's not perfect, you hear me?
Oh, Nicky. Oh!
shut up, Pete.
did you know you were being followed by the police?
who are you?
did you know that you were being followed by the police?
no. - Well, you are.
you're coming with me. - Where are we going?
you wonder why I'm angry?
stomping through the forest in the middle of the night, freezing cold, in the mud, with my good boots on.
get up, come on.
cause you guys are sloppy, you don't think.
I gotta clean up your mess or it's gonna be on me.
you weren't there. - Doesn't matter.
any of you go down, you'll take me with you, I know it.
I can't let you do that. Where you going?
he's in there.
Jesus.
get over here, man.
why me?
why not Matty?
or Dean?
why you?
because you're weak.
now get over here.
lift it up, man. Let's go.
Oh, Jesus, man.
what did you do, man?
... and make your entire body over exactly the way you want it, all in as little as six weeks.
Mrs. Egan? Detective Tunney.
come in.
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, but is your son Peter home?
what's this about?
we believe your son is involved in the disappearance of Nicholas Powell.
that's ridiculous. - They were friends.
if we could just ask him a few questions.
he's downstairs right now.
come on.
we know that was Nick's money, Pete.
I watched you break into his house. - You followed him?
we believe he's involved in the disappearance.
ridiculous. They're good friends.
I understand. That's why if Pete knows anything we thought he'd wanna help.
you're better than you think you are, Pete.
don't be such a coward.
tell 'em what you know.
this is the report. It's what you expected.
forensics came back. The DNAs match for Nick Powell.
Hey, look, my son's not under arrest, and we've cooperated more than we had to.
it's getting late. Peter has school tomorrow. So if there's nothing else.
let's go.
Where's Annie Newton?
God damn it! Say something, Pete!
Peter? Peter?
let's go.
talk to you soon, Pete.
talk to you soon, Pete.
Annie, it's me. We gotta meet. It's Matty.
he says he's going to the cops.
where are you? - I got him at the bridge.
keep him there, I'll be right over.
she's coming.
all right. You guys did the right thing.
man, what're you gonna do? - What am I gonna do?
what do you think I'm gonna do? She's out of control, man.
I need you to do something for me. - Look, you gotta leave me alone.
Dean and Matty are up to something, meet them at the bridge.
no. I can't take this anymore, OK?
you wanna go missing, too?
Hey, hey, hey! Wake up!
please, pay attention!
Oh, my God.
go, go, go, go! Come on, fly! Fly!
thank you.
what the hell are you doing here? Where's Annie?
she says you have to talk to me. - What? Oh, shit.
Hey, baby girl.
this is not right.
go home.
we've gotta get out of here.
there's a tail on him. - There's just no loyalty these days.
shut your mouth. You need to learn to shut your mouth.
or someone's gonna shut it for you.
and who would that be, Marcus? You?
Marcus, the cops.
Annie! - Drop the gun, Annie.
drop it now! - Put the gun down.
hold your fire.
put the gun down!
Annie, stop!
Annie! Annie!
Annie, stop!
nice.
come on, Annie, where's Nicholas? Just give it up.
they'll catch you, Annie!
Never!
Never!
she heard me.
she heard me! You heard me!
baby girl, where'd you get this? - It was Marcus's.
one fifty. - It's worth ten times that.
it's worth twenty times that.
but, word is, you're in trouble and I'm in business, so...
one fifty.
two hundred. - I just need a roof right now.
go on, disappear.
Yeah, this is where I wanna be right now.
I'm sorry.
I saw your face that night, Annie.
and I think right then, you would've traded places with me.
you know, sometimes I wish my mom was dead.
instead of my dad.
I always did what she wanted.
you know, and I never even argued.
you know, maybe if I was a little more like you, we both wouldn't be here.
I'm sorry.
Annie.
I know you can hear me.
just tell them where my body is.
we go live on the scene with the latest developments in this case.
the search is on tonight for suspect Annie Newton in the case of missing Mckinley high school honor student Nicholas Powell.
the 18-year-old is considered armed and dangerous.
newton evaded capture earlier in the day...
I'm not gonna give up on you, Annie.
I'm not giving up on you.
what about Victor?
is he gonna end up just like you, Annie?
stop the bus.
I'm dying, Annie.
I don't have much time left and you're the only one that can save my life.
how messed up is that?
Annie!
I'm right here, Annie.
right here.
Annie.
clear this stuff out of the way.
come on, quit fooling around. Let's go.
why are we here, Annie?
there's no time.
there you are.
I remember you.
you were always so scrubbed.
you were in Miss Vogel's class?
she was such a bitch. - She was such a bitch.
that was fourth of July weekend.
thirteen years old.
that's the last thing I ever did with my dad.
my mom used to take me there.
come on. Hurry, Annie. Come on.
come on.
no. No.
Pete. Pete was here.
Annie. Annie, somebody was here to move my body.
who moved my body? Think, Annie. Think.
it's there, it's right there.
come on, Annie. It's right there.
come on, Annie.
hang on, Nick.
you're doing a great job, decorating committee.
good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
as you all know...
as most of... No...
as most of you probably know, this week has been a tough one.
Where's Nick? - Don't know what you're talking about.
don't start, Pete. Just tell her. - Answer me!
answer me!
you know what's really screwed up about this whole thing?
Nick didn't do it. - What the hell are you saying?
Nick didn't turn you in.
you're lying. - No, I lied.
I thought he left town, I lied to save my ass.
you're lying. - You know what?
I didn't do it, either. - What are you talking about?
you killed Nick for nothing.
nothing. - You're lying.
Jesus, man. - Then don't believe me.
Where's the body? - Where'd you put the body?
I know you couldn't do it alone. Who helped you?
who helped you?
Marcus.
Marcus?
Marcus. - What's going on here?
little cozy, don't you think?
miss me, baby boy?
get out. I said get out. - What?
where you gonna shoot me? Outside a cop shop, baby girl?
if you want. Or, you can drive.
OK, I'll drive.
Pete, what are you doing, man?
keep walking.
I didn't say stop.
you're not doing this. - On your knees.
on your knees!
all right.
Pete, no! Pete!
what are you doing, Pete?
you don't need to do this, I'm still alive!
God, you're my last chance! Pete, please!
trust me, this isn't the answer!
if you die, I die, Pete!
Pete, please! This is not the way out!
it was you. You called the police on me.
Nick was innocent, I hurt him for nothing.
Yeah, well, that was your choice, wasn't it?
Yeah, so is this.
Jesus Christ.
Pete, wake up! Stay with me, come on!
Nick?
this is really weird.
Pete, where'd you move my body to?
Pete, please. - Where'd you move the body?
what does it matter, Annie?
he's dead. - No, he isn't!
I saw him, I looked into his eyes.
he's not dead! - How do you know?
I just know, OK? - Come on, Pete.
I screwed things up. - I know. I know, Pete...
you're the only friend I had. - I know, where's my body?
for the last time, where is he?
Where'd you move the body?
in the ruins by the dam. I'm so sorry, Nick.
Peter! - I'm so sorry, please.
Peter? - Nick?
you want the body? You'd better hurry, baby.
that water's gonna wash him away. - Have a nice life.
Hey, Annie?
Larson. - You don't have to look for me anymore.
Annie? - I can tell you where Nick is.
he's still alive. I just need you to do one thing for me.
I left something for my brother.
it's in my locker at school.
make sure he gets it, please.
I'll take care of it.
Nick's at the Broward Dam.
OK. - What is it?
the dam gates open in 15 minutes. - So, what are you saying?
anything downstream of it will be flooded out.
how much time we got? - We don't.
help me!
help!
somebody help me! Help!
we don't have minutes. We have to cut the flow. Now!
save me!
help!
help me!
keep looking.
I want you to look everywhere.
there! There he is!
come on. - Let's go! See if he's alive.
he's alive, I got a pulse.
no response? Got it. - Gotta get some fluids in him now.
get him up there as quick as we can.
Nick.
got it. - C-collar on.
got it. - C-collar on.
you get the rhythm? - Very slight.
Mrs. Powell? This is Detective Tunney. We found Nick.
he's alive.
we need to get bags in him. - Shut down.
I've got no IV access on that side. - Damn it.
I got no pulse.
he's in V-Tach, charge the paddles.
clear!
charge 300. - Charging.
clear.
charge to 360. - Charging.
everything all right? - Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just tired.
I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car.
no. I have to be somewhere.
ma'am! Ma'am!
teenage male found down rescued from the base of a dam, unconscious...
Nicholas?
let me be with my son. - The team will do everything we can.
he needs me, he needs me. - We will do everything we can.
now, please.
get out of the car, put your hands on your head.
Annie, I need you.
I need you, Annie. - Turn off the engine.
get out of the car, hands on your head now!
and what was the status when we found him?
Annie.
this way.
I just got word a nurse spotted a girl matching Annie's description.
stop! Stop.
what?
nothing.
OK, go.
hurry.
I'm right here.
I'm in here.
you have some nerve.
no, Mom. No.
I just need to talk to him.
talk? He can't talk, thanks to you.
you should hate me. - Hate you? Yes.
I do. I hate you.
excuse me. - Don't.
please, don't.
I can't ask you to forgive me.
stop it, Mom, stop it!
it's OK, she loves you.
what did you say?
tell her that I'm here.
I don't know how to say this, but... - Just tell her.
he's here.
Nick. - Don't.
don't you talk about my son.
you have to make her listen to you.
you have to make her listen.
I can feel him here.
everywhere.
I can even hear him. I know what he wants.
I don't believe you.
tell her that she was in my room.
you were in his room.
after I disappeared.
after he was gone. - What are you doing?
you read one of my poems, for the first time.
I was there, Mom.
I watched you.
I read it with you.
and you couldn't even finish it.
you were hurting too much, and I see that now.
I never understood what you were going through after Dad died.
how Ionely you felt.
but, I'm still here, Mom.
and you have to believe that.
I'm here.
I'm here.
what do you want?
what do you want?
I need to see him, just for a minute.
no. - I can help him.
no. - Please.
I don't know why, but, I'm supposed to be here.
I can bring him back.
I'm so sorry, Nick.
I didn't see you before.
I didn't know you.
I wish I could take it all back.
Nick.
Annie.
please.
don't go.
Annie. I'm here.
I'm right here.
Nick.
Annie.
I see you.
I see you.
Nick...
I wanted to do one good thing.
you did, Annie.
you did.
you saved me.
you saved me.
I like your plane.
what is it? - Dragonfly 220.
Yeah.
should you be out here alone?
where are your parents? - They don't know I'm here.
my sister was supposed to bring me. - But she didn't?
she died.
think we should send her a message?
how?
what should we say?
it's your message.
Hey, Annie...
Hey, Annie.
that's it. - That's it?
hold it!
ten, twenty.
you hear about Mrs. Mason's little Willy?
sent him to school and found him buried 10-foot-deep in a snow drift.
how did they get him out?
brought the fire engine round.
put the hose pipe in, pumped it backwards and sucked him out.
fifty. Well done.
l want a room and a fire.
Jenny?
Hello?
there's a gent here who wants a room and a fire.
want a room?
l said a room.
we ain't got none ready, not at this time of year.
we don't usually have folks stop in, except in the summer.
you can get one ready.
certainly, sir. Minnie!
yes?
l want a private sitting room too.
certainly, sir.
will you come through, sir? This way, sir.
lt's the coldest winter we've had down here for years.
they've had all the sheep and the cows in for a fortnight now.
poor things. They can't get a blade of green grass.
you may be near-sighted, but you can't be deaf and dumb as well.
could l take your coat and hat, sir and give them a nice dry in the kitchen?
no.
l prefer to keep them on.
very good, sir. The room will be warm soon.
l've got some luggage at the station. How can l have it sent?
l'll get it brought over tomorrow, sir. Are you going to stay a bit?
Yes.
ls there no way of getting it tonight?
Oh, not tonight, sir.
very well.
bring me some food.
right away, sir.
lf you ask me, he's a criminal flying from justice.
go on. He's snow-blind, that's what he is.
has to wear goggles to save his eyes.
anyway, you be careful and lock your money up.
a bottle of Bass, Herbert.
here you are, dear.
l hope he'll be a bit more communicative this time.
your supper, sir.
ls there a key to that door?
a key, sir?
l haven't ever seen one.
l don't think there was one when we came here.
l want to be left alone and undisturbed.
l'll see that no one disturbs you, sir.
here's the mustard, ma'am.
you'll be the death of me with your slowness.
here, you let me take the gentleman's supper in and forget the mustard !
and him wanting to be left alone!
there she goes again. . .
l told you not to disturb me.
lt's only the mustard, sir. l forgot it.
l'm sorry.
thank you.
have you been motoring on them slippery roads, sir?
you can take my overcoat and dry it.
very good, sir.
leave the hat.
Yes, sir.
bandages right up to the top of his head, all round his ears.
any blood?
no, no blood.
looks like some kind of horrible accident.
bumped his head on the prison wall getting over.
father.
l wish you'd leave me alone, Flora, when l'm working.
l can't bear it. We've got to do something.
do something? What about?
about Jack.
Oh, he'll come back. Don't you worry.
father, please put that horrid thing down and listen.
lt's nearly a month now without a word.
but the note he left was quite clear.
he said we might not hear for a while.
lt's a good thing to go away when you're finishing a difficult experiment.
what kind of experiment is it, Father?
something of his own.
l had a terrible feeling last night.
l felt he was in desperate trouble.
Hello, Kemp. Flora's worried about Griffin.
l don't wonder. l should've thought at least he could drop a line.
lt's a queer thing.
lt certainly is, considering he was in your employ.
he had my permission to carry out his own experiments in his spare time.
and clear off when he liked, for as long as he liked?
what does it matter, if he's in trouble?
l've got the car outside. lt'll give you a rest to come for a run.
do you think there are any papers in his room to help us?
surely he must have arranged where he was going.
there may be letters.
he left a heap of burnt papers in his fireplace, that's all.
he was so strange those last few days before he went. . .
so excited and strung up. And yet he wouldn't say a word to explain.
l've never seen him like it before.
he was always so keen to tell me about his experiments.
he meddled in things men should leave alone.
what do you mean?
your father's a scientist, Flora.
he's discovered more about preserving food than any man living.
Jack and l were employed to help him.
that's a plain, straightforward job.
lt's not romantic but it saves hundreds of deaths and thousands of stomach aches.
what did you mean about "things men should leave alone"?
he worked in secret.
he kept a lot of stuff locked in a cupboard in his laboratory.
he never opened that cupboard until he'd barred the door and drawn the blinds.
straightforward scientists have no need for barred doors and drawn blinds.
he cares nothing for you, Flora.
he'll never care about anything but test tubes and chemicals.
how can he go away like this without a word?
flora, dear. . . please, darling, let me tell you how l feel.
l can't work or sleep until l know.
Oh, leave me alone! How can you?
damn ! you annoy me.
there's a way back, you fool.
there must be a way back.
what is it?- Your lunch, sir.
take it away.
you don't want it cold, do you?
do you suppose that l'm going to carry trays backwards and forwards all day?
lunch is at 1: 00, and it's 1: 00 now!
get out!
he's not gonna stay under this roof, not another hour.
crashed the tray out of me hand and swore at me.
turned my best sitting room into a chemist's shop.
spilled it on the carpets.
and him a week behind with his money.
go and tell him if he ain't packed up and gone in half an hour, we'll have the law in to turn him out.
and take him his bill !
three pounds ten. And see you get it before you come out.
go on !
let's leave him a bit, Jenny, till he cools off.
go on. Do it now. Him and his goggles and his chemist's shop.
lf you don't kick him out, l'm clearing out meself, and that's the truth.
and l mean it this time.
and a whole day's work ruined by a foolish, ignorant woman !
there must be a way back.
God knows there's a way back.
lf only they'd leave me alone.
look here, mister. We can't have this no more.
you've broken the wife's best china.
you're a week behind with the rent.
you've got to pack up and go.
l'm expecting some money, Mr. Hall.
l'll pay you directly it comes.
you said that last week, and it hasn't come yet.
l came here for quiet and secrecy.
l'm carrying out a difficult experiment.
l must be left alone. lt's vital.
lt's life and death that l should be left alone.
you don't understand.
l understand all right.
you don't pay.
and what's more, you're driving folks away from our house.
Mr. Hall, l've had a serious accident.
lt's disfigured me, affected my eyes.
l don't mean that. l mean the way you carry on throwing things about on the carpets and swearing.
lt's no good, mister. You've got to go.
l implore you to let me stay. l beg of you.
the wife says if you don't go, she is. So it's got to be you.
come on. l'll help you to get this stuff packed up.
leave that alone and get out of here!
look here! ls this my house or yours?
what are you doing? Help!
help! Help! Police!
he's a raving lunatic!
go and get a policeman.
please don't cry, now. He'll be all right. He's not harmed.
he's all right. Please don't cry.
shut up!
please don't cry.
come on, Jaffers.
what's all this?
lt's the stranger with the goggles. He's gone mad.
he assaulted Mrs. Hall and nearly killed her husband.
he's upstairs in the sitting room.
he's in there in the sitting room. He's homicidal.
let that down.
keep back, you kids there.
go on out.
what's all this?
keep back there.
keep back? Me? Do you know who you're talking to?
l give you a last chance to leave me alone.
give me a last chance?
you've committed assault, that's what you've done.
you can come along to the station with me.
come along, now. Come quietly. Unless you want me to put the handcuffs on.
stop where you are. You don't know what you're doing.
l know what l'm doing all right. Come on.
all right, you fools.
you've brought it on yourselves.
everything would've come right if you'd only left me alone.
you've driven me near madness with your peering through the keyholes.
and peeping through the curtains.
and now you'll suffer for it!
you're crazy to know who l am, aren't you?
all right, l'll show you !
there's a souvenir for you.
and one for you !
l'll show you who l am and what l am !
look. He's all eaten away.
how do you like that, eh?
lt was horrible.
what's wrong?
well, Jaffers, what do you think?
he's invisible.
that's what's the matter with him.
lf he gets the rest of them clothes off we'll never catch him in a thousand years.
come on.
they've asked for it, the country bumpkins.
this will give them a bit of a shock.
something to write home about.
a nice bedtime story for the kids, too, if they want it.
put the handcuffs on.
how can l handcuff a bloomin' shirt?
quick, get hold of him !
are you satisfied now, you fools?
lt's easy, really, if you're clever.
a few chemicals mixed together, that's all.
and flesh and blood and bone just fade away.
a little of this injected under the skin of the arm every day for a month.
an invisible man can rule the world !
nobody will see him come. Nobody will see him go.
he can hear every secret. He can rob and rape and kill !
not if he can't get no further than this room, he won't.
here, shut that door.
now, then, you'd better come along quietly.
look out! Mind that window!
you think l'd escape like a common criminal?
you need a lesson.
l think l'll throttle you.
let go of me! Let go!
you must be made to understand what l can do.
Hey, look out!
Hey, whoa!
Hey! Hey!
let him go! Look out!
l'm afraid l need this bicycle.
he stole my bike!
stop him ! stop him !
here's your blooming bicycle.
you can do what you like with it.
how's that for a hair brush, George Henry?
good Morning, grandfather, how do you do?
we do our part.
mama, never mind the plated goods. Give me the diamonds.
on the gospel, it's the truth. He tried to strangle me, sir.
where are you speaking from, Jaffers?
lion's Head lnn, eh?
did you say an invisible man?
well, look here. You put more water in it next time.
he won't believe me. You tell him.
Mr. Hall speaking. The constable's telling the truth, all right.
man: lnvisible man special ! horrible murder in Iping ! lnvisible man. . .
not the slightest clue.
l didn't expect there would be.
that's where the clues are. He wasn't leaving anything to chance.
Griffin was never the man for secrets. He came to me with everything.
he kept a lot of stuff locked in here.
l came in one evening when he wasn't expecting me.
he was standing here by this cupboard. lt was full of instruments.
when he saw me, he slammed the door and turned the key.
hmm.
you say he brought a packing case up here?
the night before he disappeared l heard him hammering, packing everything up.
here's something, Kemp.
what is it? Bad news?
lt's only a rough note, a list of chemicals.
and the last on the list is monocaine.
monocaine? What is monocaine?
Monocaine's a terrible drug.
l never heard of it.
you wouldn't, Kemp. lt's never used now.
l didn't know it was even made.
lt's a drug that's made from a flower that's grown in lndia.
lt draws color from everything it touches.
years ago they tried it for bleaching cloth.
they gave it up because it destroyed the material.
that doesn't sound terrible.
Yes, l know. But it does something else, Kemp.
lt was tried out on some poor animal. . . a dog, l believe.
lt was injected under the skin and it turned the dog dead white like a marble statue.
ls that so?
Yes, and it also sent it raving mad.
you surely don't think. . .
l only pray to God that Griffin hasn't been meddling with this ghastly stuff.
he'd never touch a thing with madness in it.
he might not know.
l found that experiment in an old German book, just by chance.
the English books only described the bleaching power.
they were printed before the German experiment.
what are we going to do, Doctor?
l think we must tell the police that Griffin's disappeared.
but only that he's disappeared.
l put you on your honor, Kemp, not to breathe a word of this to anyone.
shall l go down to the police station with you?
lt's all right, Kemp. l'll go tonight when lnspector Lane's on duty.
l'll run along back home, then.
good night.
good night, Kemp.
this is the national station broadcasting this evening's news.
remarkable story from country village.
police and doctors are investigating an astonishing story told this afternoon by the people of the village of Iping.
it appears that a mysterious disease has broken out infecting a large number of the inhabitants.
lt takes the form of a delusion that an invisible man is living among them.
several people have been seriously injured probably through fighting among themselves in the belief the their opponent is an invisible man.
the whole village is in a state of panic, and everyone...
and everyone deserves the fate that's coming to them.
panic, death, things worse than death.
don't be afraid, Kemp. lt's me, Griffin.
Jack Griffin. How are you, my friend?
l'm frozen with cold.
dead tired. Thank God for a fire.
sit down, you fool. Let's have a decent fire.
did you hear me? Sit down.
unless you want me to knock your brains out.
sit down !
l want you to listen carefully, Kemp.
l've been through hell today. l want food and sleep.
but before we sleep, there's work to do. May l have a cigarette?
you always were a dirty little card, Kemp.
you're frightened out of your wits, aren't you?
Oh, it's no good talking like this.
have you got a good long surgical bandage?
good. And a pair of dark glasses?
right. Go and get them at once.
let me have a dressing gown, and pajamas, and a pair of gloves.
you'll feel better if you can see me, won't you?
come on. We've no time to waste.
you'll find some pajamas in that room.
here are the gloves and bandages.
l'll bring you the glasses.
thank you. Don't be long.
put them on the table.
now go down and draw the blinds in your sitting room.
are we alone in the house?
Yes. - Good.
all right, go now.
lf you raise a finger against me, you're a dead man.
l'm strong, and l'll strangle you. Understand?
wait for me downstairs.
the sitting room, l said, Kemp.
and if you try and escape by the window, l shall follow you.
and no one in the world can save you.
here comes the inspector now.
get up.
nice fool you've made of me. l've got reports for ten miles around.
not a sign of anything. l'll tell you what l think of your invisible man.
lt's a hoax.
good business for the saloon bar, Mr. Hall?
suppose l'd break my neck to sell a gallon of beer?
l'll have an inquiry right now.
bring in everybody who thinks they saw or heard anything.
l'll get at the bottom of this before the night's out.
here. Get those tables together.
now, Kemp.
now, then, we can talk as man to man.
sit down.
one day l'll tell you everything. There's no time now.
l began five years ago in secret working all night, every night, right into the dawn.
a thousand experiments, a thousand failures.
and then, at last, the great, wonderful day.
but, Griffin, it's ghastly.
the great, wonderful day.
the last little mixture of drugs.
l couldn't stay here any longer, Kemp.
l couldn't let you see me slowly fading away.
so l packed up and went to a little village for secrecy and quiet to finish the experiment and complete the antidote the way back to visible man again.
l meant to come back just as l was when you saw me last.
the fools wouldn't let me work in peace.
l had to teach them a lesson.
but why. . . why do it, Griffin?
just a scientific experiment at first. That's all.
to do something no other man in the world had done.
but there's more to it than that, Kemp. l know now.
lt came to me suddenly. The drugs l took seemed to light up my brain.
suddenly l realized the power l held.
the power to rule, to make the world grovel at my feet.
we'll soon put the world right now, Kemp.
you and l.
l? You mean. . .
l must have a partner, Kemp.
a visible partner to help me in the little things.
you're my partner, Kemp.
we'll begin with a reign of terror a few murders here and there.
murders of great men, murders of little men just to show we make no distinction.
we might even wreck a train or two.
just these fingers around a signalman's throat.
that's all.
Griffin, for heaven's sake!
you want me to take these off?
no, no.
very well, then. We'll make our plans tomorrow.
tonight we have a small job to do.
go and get your car out, Kemp.
Why? Where are we going?
back to the village l left this morning.
l came away without my notebooks.
they contain all the results of my experiments.
l must have them here.
but it's past 8: 00.
lt's only 1 5 miles. Go now, quickly.
and take a bag with you for the books.
put a warm rug in the car.
lt's cold outside when you have to go about naked.
all ready?
Yes.
come on ! get in !
where is that rug?-ln the back.
l'm frozen. Cold enough to freeze the icicles off an Eskimo.
we'll stop in a lane 100 yards from the inn.
l'll go in and give you the books through the window
they'll have a guard.
what can a guard do, you fool?
l must have those books, Kemp.
l'll work in your laboratory till l find the antidote.
and sometimes l'll make you invisible, give me a rest.
l was walkin' home to my lunch, sir. when all of a sudden, something takes hold of me hat and throws it in the pond.
how many drinks did you have on your way home?
only a couple, sir. That's all.
a couple of drinks and a gust of wind. So much for you.
now, then, about the bicycle.
Where's the owner of the bicycle?
here, sir.
lt was pulled clean out of me hands, sir.
then it went peddling off down the street, all by itself.
stop here.
come on, get out.
take your bag and walk straight down the street. l'll guide you.
wait outside the pub window till the books come out.
put them in your bag and come back to the car. Then wait for me.
don't stare at me, you fool. Look in front of you.
come on, get a move on !
here we are, Kemp. ln here.
here. Stroll up and down as though you were waiting for someone.
watch for that window to open.
Griffin? Griffin? Are you there?
who's that, opened that door?
lt's them boys again, sir.
here, you leave this door alone. lt's private, see?
we never touched it!
Yes, you did. Go on !
go on ! off you go!
Crazies! Crazies!
here you are, Kemp.
lies from beginning to end !
l have a good mind to prosecute the whole lot of you for conspiracy.
l shall announce this evening that the whole thing is a hoax and you'll be the laughingstock of the entire country.
he's here! The lnvisible Man !
don't leave me! Wait for me! Don't leave me! Wait for me!
a hoax, is it? All a hoax?
all a hoax?
there.
all right, off you go.
go for your life too!
did you hear some shouting and screaming?
what was that screaming?
had to take some exercise to keep warm.
l killed a stupid little policeman. Smashed his head in.
we start in earnest tomorrow morning, Kemp.
good evening, Doctor.-Good evening.
ls lnspector Lane at the station? l want a word with him.
Yes, sir. . .
extra special ! lnvisible Man slays policeman !
evening paper! Get your paper!
nasty business, this.
lt's a conjuring trick, that's what it is.
l saw a fellow make a peanut disappear once.
there are one or two things you must understand, Kemp.
l must always remain in hiding for an hour after meals.
the food is visible inside me until it is digested.
l can only work on fine, clear days.
lf l work in the rain, the water can be seen on my head and shoulders.
ln a fog, you can see me, like a bubble.
ln smoky cities, the soot settles on me until you can see a dark outline.
you must always be near at hand to wipe off my feet.
even dirt between my fingernails would give me away.
lt is difficult, at first, to walk down stairs.
we are so accustomed to watching our feet.
but these are trivial difficulties.
we shall find ways of defeating everything.
you will sleep in the room opposite and bring me some more food at 8: 00.
good night.
now you'll understand my plans.
you're in charge of all country east of here, Thompson for 20 miles to the north of the main road.
very good, sir.
Neville, you take the opposite section to the south.
Stollen, you take charge of the search in the hills.
and Hogan, you'll take all the villages out to the river.
right, sir.
now, we shall comb the country for 20 miles round.
we've got a terrible responsibility. He's mad, and he's invisible.
he may be standing beside us now.
but he's human, and we shall get him.
we shall have 1 000 men out tonight.
tomorrow we shall have 1 0, 000 volunteers to help them.
there's a broadcast warning going out at 10: 30.
now, at all costs, we must avoid a panic spreading.
now get away to your districts at once and send me a note of your headquarters.
and remember, he'll leave tracks even if he himself is invisible.
I must interrupt the dance music for a moment.
I have an urgent message from police headquarters.
earlier this evening, we broadcast a report of an invisible man.
the report has now been confirmed.
it appears that an unknown man, by scientific means has made himself invisible.
he has attacked and killed a police inspector and is now at large.
the chief of police appeals to the public for help and assistance.
those willing to cooperate in the search are requested to report tomorrow morning to their local station.
the Invisible Man works without clothing. He will have to seek shelter.
you're requested to lock every door and window and every outbuilding he may use to hide in.
the police will be glad to receive any suggestions that will help in capturing the fugitive.
remember, he's solid but cannot be seen.
a reward of £1 , 000 will be given to any person whose information leads to his capture.
the police appeal to the public to keep calm and to admit uniformed search parties to all property.
bar the windows. -Keep the fiend out.
lock up the doors. -Take no chances.
lock the windows.
check the building round back.
lock the door.
l've got the doors padlocked.
l'll keep him out.
Hello?
hello. Get me eashire, 1021 .
Hello?-Doctor, listen.
there's something ghastly. lt's Griffin. He's come back.
he's the lnvisible Man. He's asleep in my room.
he's mad, a raving lunatic! He's killed a man tonight.
listen to me, Kemp. No one but you and l know that it's Griffin.
l shall come in the morning.
you must come now! l can't bear it!
lf l come now, he'll be suspicious and escape.
you must keep him calm and quiet for tonight. l trust you, Kemp.
who was that, Father?
lt was Kemp.
lt was about Jack. l know it. What is it?
tell me.
Oh, leave me alone, Flora, please.
l'm not afraid. Tell me.
Jack Griffin's come back. He's at Dr. Kemp's house now.
Jack Griffin's the lnvisible Man.
say, is that the police? Was that £1 , 000 reward right?
well, listen, l've got a way to catch him.
the paper says he threw ink at the man he killed.
well, you get your own back and squirt ink about with a hosepipe until you hit him.
the ink'll stick on him, see? Then you can shoot him.
ls that the police?
l want to tell you how to catch the lnvisible Man.
the paper says it's gonna be frosty in a day or two.
well, you watch out when it's frosty, then you can see his breath.
police, quickly.
ls this the police? This is Dr. Kemp.
the lnvisible Man is in my house, asleep upstairs.
come at once. Hurry!
listen, Doctor, l've only got five men here.
l'll want a hundred to surround the house.
Yes, all right, l'll send them up as soon as possible.
you must leave it to me and Kemp.
we shall work day and night to undo this terrible experiment.
you must let me go to him.
only when he's well again.
no, now. l can do more with Jack than you or Dr. Kemp.
but, Flora, he's not normal. His mind's unhinged. At present, he's mad.
l can persuade him to help you.
you're powerless unless he does.
get your coat, Father. l'll be ready in five minutes.
but it's past midnight.
wait till the morning.
lt's life or death, Father. You know that.
l'll go alone, then.-Flora.
who's that? Who's that?
unlock the door, Kemp. Let me in.
what are you doing here, Kemp?
l couldn't sleep. l had to get up, come down.
why did you lock the door?
l. . . l was afraid.
wouldn't you be afraid if l were invisible like you?
there's no need to be afraid, Kemp.
we're partners. Bosom friends.
we've a busy day ahead. You must sleep.
l see. You told the police.
that was why you went downstairs.
no, l. . . l didn't. l swear l didn't.
look, it's not the police. lt's Dr. Cranley and Flora.
flora.
why, yes, of course.
l had to tell them you were back, Griffin.
flora was nearly mad with anxiety.
how could l forget?
shall l let them in?
Yes, of course you must let them in.
l shall go and prepare myself in my room.
l shall see Flora. . . alone.
he knows you're here.-You said he was asleep.
he saw you from the window. He wants to see Flora alone.
no, Flora, don't.
he's calm now, quiet.
Jack won't do me any harm.
l tell you, he's insane.
lt's for us to cure him, Kemp and l.
keep away, Flora.-l must go to him.
listen, Doctor, he was a different man when he saw Flora leave the car.
he won't hurt her. We must play for time.
why for time?
we must prepare things.
lf we try and bind him now, he'll throw us off and escape.
we must take him when he's asleep and chloroform him. Wait here.
flora, my darling.
thank God you're home, Jack.
l would have come to you at once, Flora, but for this.
how wonderful it is to see you.
how beautiful you look.
that funny little hat, I always liked. You've been crying.
l want to help you. Why did you do this?
for you, Flora.
for me?
Yes, for you, my darling. l wanted to do something tremendous to achieve what men of science have dreamt of since the world began to gain wealth and fame and honor.
to write my name above the greatest scientists of all time.
l was so pitifully poor.
l had nothing to offer you, Flora.
l was just a poor, struggling chemist.
l shall come back to you, Flora, very soon now.
the secret of invisibility lies there in my books.
l shall work in Kemp's laboratory till l find a way back.
there is a way back, Flora. And then l shall come to you.
l shall offer my secret to the world, with all its terrible power.
the nations of the world will bid for it. Thousands, millions.
the nation that wins my secret can sweep the world with invisible armies.
Jack, l want you to let my father help you.
you know how clever he is. He'll work with you day and night until you find that second secret the one that'll bring you back to us.
then we'll have those lovely, peaceful days again out under the trees, after your work in the evening.
your father? Clever? You think he can help me?
he's got the brain of a tapeworm, a maggot beside mine.
don't you see what it means? Power! Power to rule!
to make the world grovel at my feet!
Jack, listen to me! Listen !
my father found a note in your room.
he knows something about monocaine even you don't know.
lt alters you, changes you, makes you feel differently.
father believes the power of it will go if you know what you're fighting.
Oh, come and stay with us. Let's fight this thing out together.
power, l said !
power to walk into the gold vaults of the nations into the secrets of kings, into the Holy of Holies power to make multitudes run, squealing in terror at the touch of my little invisible finger.
even the moon's frightened of me, frightened to death
the whole world's frightened to death.
so, l see. Kemp couldn't sleep.
he had to go downstairs. He was frightened.
l put my trust in Kemp.
l told him my secret, and he gave me his word of honor.
you must go now, Flora.
l want to help you.
there is nothing for you to do, my dear, except to go.
l shall come back.
l swear l shall come back, because l shall defeat them.
go now, my dear.
no. l want to stay. You must hide.
don't worry. The whole world's my hiding place.
l can stand out there amongst them in the day or night and laugh at them.
come along, my darling.
Oh, Father.
pass on word, link hands all around the house.
link hands. Link hands.
stay close together, or he'll slip under your arm.
now, boys, forward.
thank you, Kemp, for opening the window.
you're a true friend, Kemp, a man to trust.
l've no time now, but believe me as surely as the moon will set and the sun will rise, l shall kill you tomorrow night.
l shall kill you even if you hide in the deepest cave of the earth.
at 1 0: 00 tomorrow night, l shall kill you
help! Help! He's here! He's here!
here he comes!
link hands where you are!
keep your arms down.
what is it?
something smacked my face.
naughty boy.
let go!
what's the matter with you?
he pinched my nose.
now, steady, boys. We've got him all right this time.
good shot.
get that hat!
now, then, boys, advance slowly.
lt's all right, he's unarmed, and we've got him easy.
help! Help! He's got me by the feet! Here he is! Help!
lt's the lnvisible Man !
he's got him by the feet. Help him, boys, quick!
grab him ! grab him !
help me!
what do you know about that?
here we go gathering nuts in May Nuts in May, nuts in May
here we go gathering nuts in May On a cold and frosty morning
he threatened to kill me at 10: 00 tonight.
you must lock me up. Put me in prison.
you're not the only one in danger, Dr. Kemp.
l'll see that you have protection.
now, Dr. Cranley, you're concealing something from me.
well. . .-One moment!
l want you to explain why you and your daughter were in this house at 2: 00 this morning?
Dr. Kemp called me up, he told me the man was here he wanted my help.
why did he ring you before the police?
why did your daughter come too?
she came to drive the car.
you know who the lnvisible Man is, Doctor.
l understand you have another assistant besides Dr. Kemp.
a Dr. Griffin. Where is Dr. Griffin?
he's gone away.-lt is Griffin !
what's the good of concealing it?
lt's Griffin, and he's threatened to murder me!
he may be here now, beside us or in the garden looking through the window or in a corner of my bedroom waiting for me, waiting to kill me!
and you all sit there, doing nothing ! nothing !
we've doubled the search party ten miles around Kemp's house.
there's nothing to report, sir.
the policeman's trousers were found in a ditch a mile away. That's all.
well, it's beaten me.
l'll give £1 , 000 for a practical idea.
he's roaming the country at will. A madman !
here l am. Aren't you pleased you've found me?
would you like to keep him company?
stand away! Keep back!
thank you.
give me £5 worth of silver, please.
Yes, sir.
thank you. Good day.
good morning, Mr. Simpson.-Good morning.
Morning.-Morning, sir.
pleasant day, sir?-Rather nice.
there you are. A present from the lnvisible Man !
money! Money! Money! Money!
up and down the City Road In and out the eagle
that's the way the money goes! Pop! goes the weasel
money, money, money, money, money, money, money!
twenty men of the search parties have been killed and a hundred in the train disaster.
the lnvisible Man has been reported in a hundred different places.
now, l appeal to you to help us keep the public calm.
can you tell us what plans you've got for capturing him?
a hundred thousand men are searching and watching.
Yes, l know. But have you any secret means of getting him?
the police have offered £2, 000 for the first effective means.
why not bloodhounds?
the bloodhounds have lost the scent.
why not put wet tar on all the roads then chase the black soles of his feet?
because he's not a fool. Now, we've got one hope, gentlemen but l daren't say a word of it here.
he may be standing there beside you, listening.
try and sleep now, my dear.
there's nothing you can do.
we must just pray that the police can take him without harming him.
stand back, close against the wall.
now, then, drag that net clear across the room.
now, everything depends on the way we carry out my plan.
l'll tell you after we've made certain he's not in this room.
good. Now we're safe here at last.
constable, keep an eye on that window.
now come here, all of you, and sit down.
now listen carefully.
we've got a chance tonight that will never come again.
he's threatened to murder Dr. Kemp at 10: 00.
and from what we know of him, he'll do his utmost to carry that out.
he's certain to be near this house watching for some time beforehand.
now, at 9: 30, Dr. Kemp, with a bodyguard of police will leave this house and walk down to the police station.
lt's a natural thing for Dr. Kemp to seek protection.
now, the lnvisible Man is certain to be near.
he's certain to see what's happening.
you mean you're going to use me as a bait?- Yes.
l can't.
you must. You'll be perfectly safe.
safe? l tell you, he's not human.
he can go through anything. Prison walls, everything.
don't be a fool.
l tell you, l can't sit in that station waiting.
he'll kill you, kill you all, then take the keys and come to me.
very well. lf you're afraid of waiting in the police station you can leave it directly you're inside.
there's a secret way out through the inspector's private house.
we'll disguise you as a policeman and you can walk out with other uniformed men and drive away.
even if he sees you, he won't recognize you.
he'll most probably be waiting in front to break in at 10: 00.
what happens to me then?
l'll have you driven back quietly to this house by the back lanes.
then get into your car and drive away into the country.
miles away. And stay there until you heard we've got him.
now you needn't be afraid. We'll get him all right this time.
l'll lay traps that even an invisible man can't pass.
you see, it covers a fairly wide range.
l've got 20 of these guns and a good man to each.
one splash of this on his skin and we've got something to follow at last.
why not paint the top of the wall?
because he'd smell it.
l've got a better plan.
l'm going to put a thin layer of loose earth along the top of the wall.
the slightest touch will disturb it, and we've got him trapped.
Oh, l see. Pretty good.
forward. Quick, march !
they think they're very clever.
all right, take him straight inside.
twenty minutes to 10: 00. Keep your eyes open now, boys.
here, quick, sir. l heard footsteps outside.
soft footsteps, like naked feet.
listen.
all ready. Come on.
where are you going to?
ln the mountains, 100 miles away.
drive away quickly.
well. . . lt's ten minutes to 10: 00.
he's bound to do something any minute.
do you suppose he'll try getting in through the station?
every door and window is barred, with a double guard on each.
he'll try the wall right enough.
there he goes! There!
to your stations now. Watch the wall.
he's over the wall. l felt breathing down my neck.
he's in here!
10: 00! 10: 00 he wanted to murder me!
l think this'll do nicely, Kemp. We'll stop here.
lt's 10: 00. l came with you to keep my promise.
No! lt's all a mistake, Griffin.
l swear, l never told the police.
l want to help you. Let me be your partner.
l've had a cold and uncomfortable journey just to keep my promise at 10: 00.
l went into the police station with you, Kemp.
l stood by while you changed into that coat.
l rode on the running board of the car that took you home again.
l know that l could never tell who you are. Who are you?
there. You sit there. l've got you where l want you.
l hope your car's insured, Kemp.
l'm afraid there's going to be a nasty accident in a minute.
a very nasty accident.
listen, l'll do anything, everything you ask me.
you will? That's fine.
just sit where you are. l'll get out and take the hand brake off and give you a little shove to help you on.
you'll run gently down and through the railings.
you'll have a big thrill for 100 yards or so till you hit a boulder.
then you'll do a somersault and probably break your arms.
then a grand finish-up with a broken neck.
well, good-bye, Kemp. l always said you were a dirty little coward.
you're a dirty, sneaking little rat as well. Good-bye.
a thousand replies have come to my appeal for suggesting ways of catching the lnvisible Man.
some are clever, some stupid, but all are impossible.
he's got to sleep. They might catch him asleep.
he's got to eat and drink.
a cafe was robbed last night in Manton.
there's no proof he did it.
there are robberies every night by ordinary burglars.
this feels good.
look there! We wanted help. There it is.
lt's now or never. Snow won't lie long at this time of year.
lt may be gone in a few hours.
find out if the snow is general over the country.
send out a broadcast message.
he can't stay out in this bitter cold. He'll seek shelter.
excuse me, sir. There's breathing in my barn.
what do you mean, breathing in your barn?
the lnvisible Man, sir, sure as l stand here.
the farmer may have imagined it but we can't leave anything to chance.
surround the barn. No use trying to take him on the inside.
force him out into the snow.
take a pile of wood and gasoline and set fire to it.
that's it, sir. He's in there under a pile of straw, sir.
are there any windows he can watch from?
no, sir. Only the door, sir.
there's a reward of £1 , 000 waiting for you if we're successful.
that's the place, and we're lucky to have the open country.
take your men over to the line of trees and cover the country from the road to the top of the hill.
line the ridge hrough those trees, double.
now, Chief. There's no time to lose.
we can't wait till he comes out to search for food.
we must fire the barn at once and drive him out into the snow.
you men, keep in single file.
we don't want a lot of your footprints around the barn.
we want to keep the snow for his feet alone.
get that searchlight on the door of that barn.
he's out! Look!
shall l give the signal to advance?
l don't think your guard will be needed any longer.
how is he?
he's very near the end.
are you Dr. Cranley?
Yes. l had a message to come immediately.
towards dawn this morning, he grew quiet.
he called the name of a girl. l understand your daughter, Dr. Cranley.
she's waiting below. ls there any chance?
bullet passed through both lungs.
lt's impossible to treat the wound.
do you think your daughter could bear to go to him?
l'm afraid the end may be rather terrible.
the effect of the drugs will die with him.
his body will become visible as life goes.
l'll bring her now.
ls Flora there?
she's coming now.
l knew you would come to me, Flora.
l wanted to come back to you.
my darling, l failed.
l meddled in things that man must leave alone.
father, come quickly!
you want to go to the Island. Your purpose in life is to populate the Island. You're part of a new beginning.
you're special. Very special. You've been chosen.
you've been chosen. Chosen to survive, to carry on.
you want to go to the Island.
go, go! - You have a very special purpose.
very special.
he's gotta be in here. - I'm looking!
check over here!
watch your left!
run!
go! Run!
he's over here!
there they are! Go!
Lincoln! - Come on! Get him!
let's go. Move! - Come on!
come on! Come on!
Damn! Go, go! Go!
come on, let's go!
you still think there's an Island?
come on!
come on. Come on!
there's a door over here!
Lincoln Six Echo remains in quarantine after contamination exposure.
jordan Two Delta was safely transported to her new home on the Island.
jones Three Echo, I need you to concentrate in this lab.
sir, I want to focus more than anything. I love my job. It's interesting.
but Lincoln Six Echo has been contaminated, and it really worries me, because he's a good friend of mine.
he's one of my best friends. My only best friend.
he'll be fine, Three Echo.
sir, I have one question.
where do all the tubes go?
the human organism.
unique in all the universe in its complexity.
the product of three billion years of evolution.
perfect in every way, except one.
like all machines, it wears out.
for centuries, the idea of replenishing the human body has been at the forefront of science.
we need to turn this bad day into a good day.
how? - A terrific day. By selling.
by selling. Sell, sell, sell. You start, I finish.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the next generation of science, the agnate.
an organic frame engineered directly into adulthood to match the client's age.
you're looking at stage one - This way, sir.
in its development.
within 12 months it will be harvest-ready, providing a carrier for your baby, a second pair of lungs, fresh skin.
all genetically indistinguishable from your own.
and, in compliance with the eugenics laws of 2015, all our agnates are maintained in a persistent vegetative state.
they never achieve consciousness.
they never think or suffer or feel pain, joy, love, hate.
it's a product, ladies and gentlemen, in every way that matters, not human.
this is our public relations director, Mr. Whitman.
he'll be happy to answer any questions.
once again, thank you. Mr. Whitman.
I want to talk about the smartest investment you'll ever make.
and I want to tell you how you're gonna live 60 to 70 years longer.
Dr. Merrick, Albert Laurent, Blackhawk Security.
you come highly recommended by the Defense Department, Mr. Laurent.
though I'm unaware of your personal qualifications.
my men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.
I was formerly with the GlGN, French Special Forces.
I understand you had a corporate theft.
Yes, that's what I told the Defense Department.
the reality is a little more complex. That's why I require your services.
we've had a... security breach.
you have the Defense Department at your disposal. Why call me?
because their investment here is sizeable.
one hundred and twenty billion dollars, to be exact.
and I can't afford for them to reconsider.
what you tell them is your business, doctor.
I am in the business of keeping my clients' confidence.
good.
two of our products have escaped.
lmpressive, considering they're vegetative.
well, after several years of trial and error, we discovered that without consciousness, without human experience, emotion, without life, the organs failed.
how long have they been missing?
four hours and 36 minutes.
they're on foot? - Yes.
Wade, 1 . 2 miles an hour, five mile perimeter, - standby for suspect description. - We're on it.
follow me.
come on, we gotta keep going. - I have to stop. I can't run anymore.
you gotta try. - Where?
anywhere but here. - But there's nothing.
everything's dead, Lincoln.
what if we are contaminated?
then we'd be dead.
there's no contamination. It was a lie.
what is it? - I don't know.
but it's alive.
come on. It's mean, whatever it is.
let's rest in here.
jordan Two Delta's sponsor, Sarah Jordan, is in a coma after a car accident. She's in need of multiple transplants.
how long does she have?
forty-eight hours. Three days maximum.
tell me about Six Echo.
he was really the first one to question his environment, his whole existence here.
over the last few months, he began demonstrating unstable behavior and I can't account for it.
I'm waiting on the result of his synaptic scan.
what do they know about the outside world?
very little.
we control them with the memory of a shared event.
a global contamination. It keeps them fearful of going outside.
the Island is the one thing that gives them hope, gives them purpose.
everything we expose them to, their programs, their cartoons, books, the games they play, are designed to manage aggression and reinforce simple social skills.
to avoid obvious complications, they aren't imprinted with an awareness of sex.
we find it simpler to eliminate the drive altogether.
in a very real sense... they're like children.
educated to the level of a 15-year-old.
what was that? - I don't know.
but I want one.
look!
route 39. Route 39.
come on.
I got it from a friend.
I think that's it.
what's up?
Yeah, do you know a guy named McCord?
Yeah, we know that tool. Who's asking?
I am. - And you would be who?
Lincoln Six Echo. - Jordan Two Delta.
right.
y'all some of those desert UFO freaks?
U... What? No, I don't think so. - No.
well, lucky day, Captain Kirk. He's in the can.
he's in a can? - Taking a dump.
a dump? Taking it where?
Bubba, you're fixing to get on my nerves.
it's the first door on the right. - Thank you.
I have to go. He's taking a dump in a can.
something to drink? Jack? - Yes, please.
straight up?
Oh, that is bitchin'.
so this is Sector Five?
Hey! You son of a bitch!
you knew!
how the hell did you get out? - Why do they lie to us? Tell me!
they're gonna be looking for you.
tell me what's going on! - If anybody sees us together, both of us are gonna be dead.
so, will you just take your hands off me? Let me...
let me pull my pants up and I'll take you back to my place so we can be alone. OK?
ed. - Mac.
give you... give you boys a minute?
what? This isn't what it looks like.
sure. Sure.
get out of here, you stupid...
will you stop?
you can'tjust bust in on a guy like that. That's really rude.
she doesn't understand the licking.
you a knucklehead? You brought another one?
excuse me. - Hey. Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
back off, Joe, OK? Don't push me!
no, no, no, that's no good.
put it on my tab. We gotta go.
friends from out of town. Come on, sweetheart.
give me your number. - Two Delta.
Hey, look. Get... Don't test me.
don't.
well, this is nice.
mac doesn't talk much about his work at the Institute.
do y'all work with him?
saving lives and all must be real rewarding.
those are fancy tracksuits.
y'all exercise out in this heat, gonna get yourself nasty heatstroke.
Oh, Mac, look. They got matching bracelets.
we should do that, honey. - Suzie...
do you remember the talk we had about all the talk?
Yeah.
actually, would you run down to Red's and pick us up a sixer of Bud?
we've got to talk shop. - OK, baby.
just making friends. - I know. Good. Just...
Bye.
why do they lie, Mac?
why do they lie to us? Tell me.
to keep you from knowing what you are.
what we are? - What are we?
man, why do I gotta be the guy tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?
OK, look. You're...
well, you're not like me.
I mean, you're not... human.
I mean, you're human, but you just, you're not real.
you're not, like, a real person. Like me.
you're clones.
you're copies of people out here in the world.
what? - Clones?
what? Why? - What are you talking about?
some hag trophy wife needs new skin for a facelift or one of 'em gets sick and need a new part, they take it from you.
but I have a mother. I remember her.
Yeah, I know. - I grew up on a farm.
I have a little dog and I had a bike.
and a bike. Right.
it was a pink Flexi-Flyer with little tassels on the handlebars and you rode it to your grandmother's.
you ring the little bell and she came out and served you cookies.
Yeah.
no. Memory imprints. I seen them.
a buddy of mine is a programmer at the Institute. He showed me.
there's only 12 stories. They change around little details, but they're all pretty much the same.
the life you think you had before the "contamination,
it never happened.
come on, don't look at me like that. At least you had a bike.
wanna trade your rosy memory implants for my shitty childhood, be my guest.
how long?
how long have we been alive?
you're Echo generation, so you're three.
delta means you're four.
three?
the whole reason you exist is 'cause everyone wants to live forever.
it's the new American dream.
there's people out there that are rich enough to pay anything for it.
don't people care that they kill us? That they take parts from us?
they don't know. They think you're vegetables simmering in a jelly sack.
why do you think Merrick has you stuck in an old military bunker below ground?
he doesn't want anybody knowing the truth, especially not sponsors.
sponsors? - The people that had you made.
they, like, own you.
but why doesn't Merrick want our owners to know that we're alive?
just because people wanna eat the burger doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.
besides, do you know how many laws Merrick's breaking to have you two hatched?
your sponsors can't have any part of that.
they're like high society, rich and famous.
if they knew, Merrick would be out of business.
we have to find our sponsors and tell them the truth.
what? - Yeah.
no, that's the worst idea I ever heard.
you know how dead I'd be? Not to mention fired?
we will. We will. That's our only chance.
stop, stop! Fold, stop. Brakes. No. Come on.
you're the replacement engines on their Bentley.
they're not gonna care. What? They're gonna care?
you know what I would do?
I would just get as far away from here as I could.
go to the beach.
we're not asking for your permission, Mac.
we're asking for your help.
Oh, God.
infrared's having a hard time picking up a heat signature. Sand's too hot.
he was implanted with micro-sensors yesterday.
can we configure our instrument to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?
if we can get within half a mile. - Do it.
your sponsors names are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.
her sponsor lives in New York.
the number in your name is a regional code.
six Echo, that means your sponsor lives in LA.
you're going out of state. - Out of state?
put this on.
you're gonna go in here. All right? Come on, come on.
keep going. What size?
all right.
these are bags, OK? You put stuff in 'em.
backpacks for boys, purses for girls. Understand?
we're not idiots.
excuse me, Miss "I'm so smart l can't wait to go to the Island.
Yeah. Good.
wait. Hold, hold, hold.
people don't really wear these on the outside.
these are mail-order, OK? These stay here.
no. Mail-order, OK? Clones don't wear these.
all right, listen up.
this card is like stim credits, OK?
it'll get you food, but I gotta report it stolen in 24 hours or else they'll know I helped you. After that, use the cash.
all right, look.
I know you're new to this whole human experience and all, but there's one universal truth and that is you never give a woman your credit card.
right.
I got something. It's hot.
Oh, God.
train four... - Train'll be here. Hustle.
...to Sacramento is now boarding at platform A.
all right, stay. All right? Just stay. Don't move.
mama!
look at that!
those are kids.
Wow.
come here. The train is non-stop to LA. You need these to get on.
when you get there, look up your sponsors in the information directory.
you got it? - Yeah. Yeah.
what is an information directory? - It'll tell you where they live.
and whatever you do, do not trust anyone.
one thing I can tell you about people, is that they'll do anything to survive.
thank you, Mac. Thank you.
thanks a lot.
all right. I'm just gonna go upstairs and get you guys a map of LA.
better not get me in trouble.
Yeah, no problem. Sure, that's a good one.
I think I got an ID. Two in the center.
run!
run!
God!
Amtrak train 227 now departing for Los Angeles at platform O.
what's wrong with these people? They killed him.
this was supposed to be a simple job? - It's never simple.
we got a missing credit card.
McCord just used it to buy train tickets and it's not in his wallet.
monitor the account. Have Amtrak patch you through to the conductor.
get me a new team in LA.
got here as fast as I could. - Come here.
I finished scanning the Defense Department Troop Selections, - if you want to see them... - Not yet. Look at that.
six Echo drew it. - It's elaborate.
Renovachio." Renovatee-oh?
Renovatio. What is that, ltalian?
it's Latin.
we've never imprinted an agnate with Latin.
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
so where did he learn it?
where are the results from his scan?
they'll be back from Johns Hopkins... - Just speed it up.
Yes, sir.
you two.
ladies and gentlemen, your attention please, train number 1 7 leaving for San Diego...
there! - ...was delayed 20 minutes. Stand by.
we just arrived, but Troy's already tapped into the city cameras.
excuse me. Where's an information directory?
Thanks.
Wilshire. 5th. Grand.
spring. Grand Avenue? Smile for the camera, sweetheart.
where is Flower? You on Flower?
olive, Olive. Come on, come on.
you look familiar.
gotcha.
three Black Wasps and two jet bikes.
we just got a facial hit on our fugitives!
let's go! Let's go! Move!
we're moving! Let's go.
wait. Got a hit on McCord's credit card.
location, Grand Avenue at 9830.
team, proceed immediately to 9830.
no, no, no. LAPD's moving in. They've flagged McCord's credit card.
Tom Lincoln. - One moment, please.
not listed. - Sarah Jordan.
Hello?
Yes, I'm looking for Sarah Jordan.
she's sick.
can I talk to her? - She's at the hospital.
mommy, is that you?
Jordan. Let's go!
Freeze! Put your hands up!
keep your hands off! - Put your hands up!
do as I say! Do as I say!
Lincoln. - Just do what they say.
Lincoln.
pull back. - Move out.
what's going on?
nail it! Quick, move!
we're detaining you in connection to the murder of James McCord.
what? He was my friend! - Anything you say can and will be used - against you in a court of law. - What's a court of law?
they'll run DNA. If the agnates are booked, it'll implicate your clients in a murder investigation.
this is a nightmare.
you cannot allow this to happen. Do you understand me?
you use any force that is necessary.
I'm ordering you to contain the situation.
1-Adam-82, we've apprehended the suspects. Two adults, no ID.
notify Forensics, we'll need DNA typing.
my name is Tom Lincoln. - Sit back and shut up.
could you look up my file, please? - Sit back.
dispatch, we're two minutes out.
check inside! - Hey, can you hear me?
lincoln, get up! Get up, Lincoln! Get up!
let's go!
go! Go! Go!
go!
we got cops. We got cops!
get down!
run!
I see them! Let's get moving!
let's go! Come on, come on, come on!
move, move!
move out! Move out!
come on!
go, go, go, go! Go!
shit! Check up here!
come on!
Air-Two, give me status of the targets.
targets are under the train wheels. - Silently, take them out.
go!
move! Go, go!
I can't fit! - Move back!
I can't fit!
look out, look out!
right, right, right!
stay on them!
look out!
do not let him get away! Do not let him get away!
good job!
we've gotta bail out of here, there's police choppers inbound.
black Wasp, take out the truck!
Troy, you all right? Let's go!
cops! Cops!
he's coming back!
stay down, Jordan!
how do you know what you're doing? - I don't know!
hold on!
look out!
look out!
hold on!
don't let me go, Lincoln! - I got you! I got you!
don't let me go! - I got you!
I'm slipping! Don't drop me, Lincoln!
don't drop me! - I got you! I got you!
Lincoln! Pull me! Pull me!
climb up!
if there's no way to get our fugitives quietly, you need to take them out.
I see our targets about 70 stories up.
they're on top of the building logo.
tough day.
let's roll.
LAPD! Get away from the window!
Jay, you got him?
right there! Right there! Get him!
stay there! Damn it! Just stay down!
come on!
gonna swing around to get a shot.
he's coming back.
Oh, no.
hang on! They're coming off the building.
look out!
Jesus must love you!
that was the craziest mess I ever seen!
come on, girl. I know Jesus loves you.
can you keep a secret, doc?
why, yes, of course.
there is something going on around here.
something you may not even know about.
what is it?
well, I'm not sure that the contamination is real.
why do you think that? - OK.
Lincoln told me that he found a flying bug in Sector Six.
Wow. - Right.
and I think that might be why he thought he could leave.
have you told anyone else about this?
no, no. But I'm gonna do some digging. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
and when I do, I'll share my information with you.
thank you.
I want to be helpful. I like it here.
good.
but I really want to look into the lottery too.
something's wrong there. - Yeah.
you know, you were one of the first of the Echo generation.
you're very smart.
Yeah. I remember when I first came here.
a survivor, just like you.
one of the first, in fact.
it's natural, even healthy, to question the world we're presented.
you might say it's only... only human.
Oh, that burns!
get me a list of all the Echos in active population.
I saw his address. Tom Lincoln.
we'll go there when the rain stops.
it'll be OK when we find him. - OK.
that little boy looked like me.
his mom's gonna die, isn't she?
I don't know.
you're lying.
it's cold.
go in.
I can't.
I'll go in. - Jordan. Jordan!
Hello?
Hello?
Lincoln!
Oh, my God.
my name is Lincoln Six Echo.
I'm your insurance policy.
and what are you doing in my house?
sir, sir.
you need to see this. It's a... It's...
it's beautiful.
this is a synaptic scan we took of Six Echo three years ago, before we integrated him into the agnate population. OK?
this is his scan from a few days ago. You can see how much the memory's grown.
like he's experienced 30 years, not three, which is impossible.
or maybe this is scarring from a cortical infection that we didn't...
an infection can't teach you Latin, or how to fly.
they are memories.
but they're not his.
they belong to his sponsor.
I've seen you before.
I've seen you in Maxim, Esquire...
Maxim? - Oh, they're men's magazines.
pictures of women with little, tight, short...
...Stories too. Anyway, you're very popular.
there we are.
what is that?
that looks like some kind of thermal...
boy, your skin is so soft.
did you know?
I put some clothes out for you upstairs.
thank you. - No, thank you.
I keep expecting to wake up.
I thought I was taller.
I'm sorry to disappoint you. Come here.
she is unbelievable.
how is it you've been around three years and end up with the kind of woman
I haven't been able to find my whole life? Give me that.
she found me. She's my best friend.
why do we sound different? - I'm from Scotland.
I'm from Scotland.
Hey, look. You're creeping me out enough without that.
without that. - No, really, cut it out.
that's enough.
Yeah, that is enough. I'm sorry.
like a freak show.
Yeah, it's weird.
so, you build boats? - I design them. I draw them, yeah.
here.
I started off with cars, motorcycles. Experimental designs.
anything that blew my hair back. Kind of a speed freak, you know?
Petrol-head. - Motorcycles, wow.
I feel like I've seen these before. - It's something I've always done.
I never dreamt it would make me rich.
what's Renovatio?
'Renovatio" in Latin means rebirth.
subtle, eh?
look. I have cirrhotic hepatitis.
a parting gift from God for all my philandering.
what?
lots and lots of sex.
sex? - Sex with...
you've... You're a virgin?
you're kicking around with her and you're a virgin?
OK, I'm not gonna spoil the surprise, but, boy, are you in for a treat.
look, my doctor said that my liver will start failing within the next two years.
I'm not good at all this shite, you know? Confessions and regret.
look.
there are people who are following us.
they're trying to kill us. The reason we came is we need your help.
help you do what?
to show people what the Institute does.
but who'd believe it? I'm looking at you and I don't.
who is that guy? I know him. Is he the Community Announcer?
he's the President of America.
he has a clone. - He's an absolute idiot.
Yeah, I never liked him, either.
do a lot of people see this? - The news? A lot.
then if we can get on there together, people will see us and know the truth.
so the idea is that we both just waltz down to NBO and see if they can slot us in after the weather.
this might not mean anything to you, but there are thousands of us.
everyone we've ever known is gonna die in that place.
help us.
all right. Let me just get my shoes, OK?
Tom, hurry up!
Merrick Institute.
Merrick Biotech. How may I help you? - This is Tom Lincoln.
Hi, Mr. Lincoln. - I was wondering if you could get someone who can explain why my insurance policy is sitting downstairs on my fucking sofa.
can you hold, please? - Sure.
I'm sorry to keep you both waiting. I was getting myself organized.
OK, shall we go? Are you ready?
something's wrong. - What?
his eyes are lying. The same as yours do.
you stay here.
no, don't... - Shall we?
Yeah. - Is everything OK?
Yeah. She's gonna stay here in case they don't believe us.
no, come on, we'll all go. It'll be good.
no, she's gonna stay.
good luck. - Thank you.
that's...
do you like it? - Yeah.
I'll drive. - Oh, no. I'll drive.
no, really.
do you know how?
Yeah, I taught myself. - But you don't know the way.
well, then you can show me.
well, be careful. This is a V-12-09 Caddy.
seven hundred and fifty horsepower, $500, 000 car.
put your thumb on that.
you were worth every penny. We've the same prints.
what are you doing? - Getting directions.
Hello, Mr. Lincoln. Where would you like to go?
KNBO news studio.
one moment, please. - Thanks for doing this.
that's all right. I'd like to think you'd do the same thing if you were me.
how much did I cost? - Five million dollars.
is that a lot?
it's a small price to pay to cheat death.
that's a red. It's a red. Red. Red!
stop the car! - Why? What? Why?
it's a red light! Stop the car!
what's the matter?
you wanker! It's a red light! Stop! It means stop!
I didn't know that. - You said you could drive.
well, I do know how to drive. I just don't know what the lights mean.
I'm sorry. I'm not ready to die.
me neither!
go, go, go, go!
what are you doing? Stop! - No.
stop the car now! - No!
I'll shoot! Stop! - No!
Yes! - No!
there's cars coming at us in all directions!
they're shooting my car!
they've shot the engine! They've shot my engine!
Oh, God, my nose!
come here! Where'd you think you were going, eh?
come on! - Let go of me!
get up!
get off me! - Come on, get up!
let me go! - Get up!
no, no, no, don't shoot him. I need him. I need him.
no, don't shoot! He's my clone!
I'm Tom Lincoln! - What?
no, I'm Tom Lincoln! He's lying.
shut up! I own you!
he's the... I'm Tom Lincoln!
don't point the gun at me, you frickin' idiot!
he's the clone. Look at him! - I'm not a clone! I'm Tom!
no, I'm Tom! He's lying! Point it at him!
no. I'm not. - Shut up!
shut up, you're a clone! Shut up!
I'm Tom Lincoln!
I'm Tom Lincoln! - Don't, don't...
Oh, shit.
close.
do you think it's strange that my insurance policy just tried to kill me?
I found this whole operation strange.
Where's the woman?
she said she was going out of state...
...to look for her sponsor.
you've been witness to certain trade secrets.
you mean that they manufacture human beings who walk, talk and feel?
that kind of secret?
have you talked with anyone else about this?
who would believe it?
can I count on that?
the only thing you can count on is that people will do anything to survive.
I just want to live. I don't care how.
thank you.
thank you very much. Job well done.
Jordan? Jordan?
stop.
Hey, Jordan, it's me. It's me.
it's you.
wow, that tongue thing is amazing. - I know. Open your mouth again.
how come we never did this before? - Shut up.
the Island is real.
it's us.
how many are affected? - About half.
we're seeing the same neural patterns in all of the Echos, plus every subsequent generation: the Foxtrots, Gammas and Helos.
we predicated our entire system on predictability.
six Echo has displayed the one trait that undermines it:
human curiosity.
so... we're now facing four generations with the potential for defiant behavior.
what are you suggesting?
a recall.
wait, you mean dispose of over 200 million dollars' worth of product?
Yes. - Great.

my deepest apologies for yesterday's unfortunate inconvenience you had.
your defect in your policy wasn't, by no means, an isolated incident, and it is totally correctable, I assure you.
we are calling other valued clients right now to inform them of a recall, so, please, call us when you get in...
unfortunate inconvenience?
that's a bit of an understatement.
Mr. Lincoln, you're home. Aren't you traumatized, sir?
I mean, I had a home invasion once where they put the gun to my head.
I never forgot that. I shook for two days.
what kind of recall are you talking about?
Oh, it's a small defect that we found in four of our product lines.
what are you gonna do with the defective products?
starting over.
starting over? - Absolutely nothing to worry about.
we guarantee our product 100 percent.
the unfortunate inconvenience for you is we're gonna have to re-scan you so that we can re-grow your policy.
does today work for you at all? Pick you up by helicopter at 3: 00?
I'll call you back.
Dr. Merrick, how do we remove the defective products from the population without disrupting the others?
we already have the mechanism in place.

I'm sure you're excited to get to the Island.

do you like Picasso, Mr. Laurent?
you delivered on your promise. Well done. I'm very pleased. Thank you.
what about the client? Sarah Jordan?
she's doubtful.
even if the transplant's a success, her brain damage may be too severe for any real recovery.
you took too long bringing her back.
the girl, you're going to harvest her, kill her anyway, even though it won't make any difference?
that's the privilege our clients pay for, Mr. Laurent.
now, do excuse me, I have business to attend to.
you know my father was part of the Burkinabe Rebellion?
and when he was killed, me and my brothers were branded, so others would know we were less than human.
I've seen and done things I'm not proud of, but at some point you realize war...
...is a business.
so when did killing become a business for you?
Oh, it's so much more than that.
I have discovered the Holy Grail of science, Mr. Laurent.
I give life.
the agnates, they're simply tools, instruments.
they have no souls.
the possibilities are endless here.
in two years' time, I will be able to cure children's leukemia.
how many people on Earth can say that, Mr. Laurent?
I guess just you and God.
that's the answer you're looking for, isn't it?

and we owe him an apology.
the time is just about eight minutes past seven.
we're talking about the bill to do away with trial by jury this morning, because the select committee for justice is about to deliver it's verdict on the subject.'
on the line we're joined by Eleanor Duncan, the Minister for Justice, the strongest proponent of the bill.
minister, good morning. Good morning.
this subject is stirring up very strong feelings indeed and that's hardly surprising.
so let's be quite clear about this.
you are proposing the abolition of trial by jury full stop.
Yes, I certainly would. Why?
trial by jury brings far fewer convictions than magistrates.
it's also prone to sick leave, absenteeism, ...judges only, and is therefore... '
this is just another way of the government saving money.
trial by jury takes significantly longer than a trial with judges only and is much more of a burden to the taxpayer.
morning.
morning.
it's all above your head apparently.
according to her.
you're all unemployed.
you barely speak English and you're too stupid to understand.
perhaps I should make them aware of your doctorate in optometry.
probably would too.
don't look like that.
it's one of my last remaining pleasures to boast on your behalf.
all right, now have you got everything you need?
Yes, I'm fine, you go.
lasagne or shepherd's pie tonight?
no. Darling, don't worry about me.
all right.
shepherd's pie it is. I'll do the shopping at lunch time.
Bye. Bye.
... Jury tampering and corruption... '
now she's saying you're all corrupt.
stupid woman.
your mother and I owe you an apology.
you were right.
this is your trial.
you are the one who was summonsed. You are the juror.
we have no right to interfere.
I promise we won't speak to anyone about exempting you.
and we won't ask any more questions, OK?
but please never run off like that again.
you know it's our job to look after you.
and you know, because of your condition, you need a little extra support.
you've got to let us do our job, understood?
now, eat up and I'll take you to court.
No!
I'm going on my own.
let him go.
Rashid!
Hello, this is Jonathan Bamford. Please leave a message.'
dear.
I can tell by the look on your face you have not slept well.
not a wink. You're not good without your eight hours, we know that much.
as it happens, I've got a few things to worry about.
yeah? You know, you're not the only one.
have all articles of incorporation been provided?
has there been a complete declaration of revenue streams?
how accurate is the valuation of our assets?
are there any hidden liabilities?
the compliance stuff their lawyers have come up with is a nightmare.
I work in PR not mergers and acquisitions.
there you go again. What?
making this all about you.
quick reality check. If I get caught, Theresa, we both go to jail.
don't be ridiculous.
it's here in black and white. To personate a juror is a serious offence against public justice and will be punished accordingly.
you know what, only if you're from the defendant's family or something.
it is not necessary to prove any corrupt motive.
the offence is to enter the jury box take the oath in the name of another.
jail, Theresa. For getting you off jury service.
why "personate"? What?
not "impersonate." I don't understand. What's the difference?
what do you want me to say?
sorry" would be a start.
how could I have done this to you?
something, anything other than banging on about how much stress you're under when you're making a fortune.
OK, I understand.
and in return for giving me this opportunity,
I give you my word you can look forward to a raise.
a meaningful raise.
and a promotion.
to what? What do you have in mind?
partner. Sod off.
all right, partner salary, then.
SOD off again.
all right, junior partner with a guarantee of an assistant.
but you are an assistant.
all assistants need an assistant.
ask around.
all right.
we'll talk after it's done.
you'd better go, keep us both out of jail.
hurry up, man. OK.
OK.
what is the supreme law of the land? The constitution.
what does the constitution do?
it sets up the government and protects basic rights of Americans.
what do we call the first ten amendments to the constitution?

Cherokee, Huron, Apache.
right, every six weeks, I want your rent in advance.
all right, OK? That's all right.
Cheers. Cheers also.
Tahir. Here.
it's the one you've been waiting for, isn't it?
u. S. Citizenship and Immigration Service
Yes.
next please!
step through, please, madam.
next, please.
mr Mallory.
I call the first witness for the Crown.
I swear by almighty God that the evidence I give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
please give the court your full name.
Tanya Jane Hawkins.
and your occupation?
managing Director of inloveinlondon. com
an upscale online introduction agency. Am I right?
Yes, that's correct.
and Holly Jackson, the first victim, was one of your subscribers?
Yes, she'd been with us for about a year at the time of her death.
have you ever seen her application form?
Yes. Anything unusual about it?
no. A woman in her mid thirties looking to meet an attractive man with a good sense of humour for romance and companionship.
I'd say that was entirely typical.
which brings us to Alan Lane.
also a subscriber to your agency.
Yes, although his subscription had been cancelled by the time of the murder.
Why?
because we'd received more than one complaint about Alan Lane's behaviour from female subscribers.
and what was the nature of those complaints?
that he'd been aggressive when certain ladies refused to meet him again.
abusive, intimidating.
and what did you do?
obviously we immediately discontinued his subscription.
in situations like that we move very swiftly.
thank you. No further questions.
miss Hawkins, listening to you just now, one could infer that you thought Ms Jackson to be an entirely respectable subscriber.
yet Mr Lane quite the opposite.
is that fair? Yes.
so if you had your way, you'd have 30, 000 of the former and very few of the latter?
well, none of the latter, thank you.
interesting because having had a chance to look at their online application forms, it's clear that wholesale fraud and deception were actually only being practised by one of them.
let's start with Ms Jackson's age.
she claims in her application to be 32.
but we know at the time she joined, she was 37.
she also claims to be in full-time employment as a personnel manager in a large insurance company.
whereas, in fact, she had lost her job two years earlier.
she claimed to have been single but was very much married.
claimed to enjoy working out, be a devoted member of a book club, love exotic holidays and travel.
but records show she was neither a member of a gym nor a book club and had never travelled further afield than Gran Canaria.
in contrast, every claim Alan Lane made in his application, about his job, his marital status, what he was looking for in a partner, were 100% true.
I'm sorry, perhaps I missed it, was there an actual question?
Yes, there was.
here it comes again.
nice and slowly, so that you don't miss it this time.
having had a chance to view their online application forms, it's clear that wholesale fraud and deception were only being practised by one of them.
were you aware of that?
a simple yes or no answer at this point will do just fine.
no, I wasn't aware of that.
thank you. That's it for now.
I call the next witness for the crown.
your full name and rank, please?
detective Inspector Paul Bevan. Specialist Crime Directorate.
detective Inspector, please tell the court where you were on the morning of 6th February, 2006.
at Kingsbridge Area Homicide Office where I am based.
and this is where you were when the phone call came through from Holly Jackson's cleaning lady? Correct.
we received a call from Ms Martinez at 9: 25am.
what did you do next?
I immediately despatched the Homicide Assessment Team to the scene and followed myself shortly after.
and what did you find?
a house with no visible signs of forced entry.
a sitting room where two people had been sitting drinking wine.
and a bedroom upstairs where the victim lay on the floor.
there was visible bruising around her neck which suggested death by strangulation.
this was later confirmed at the post mortem.
at this point, you were still unsure of the victim's husband's whereabouts?
that's right, but we were very quickly able to establish an alibi for him.
mr Jackson was at a sporting event with their son.
which meant the investigation very quickly began to focus elsewhere.
on some form of lover perhaps? Correct.
but no immediate idea who at this point?
no.
but subsequent analysis of the victim's laptop uncovered a chain of e-mails with an anonymous correspondent called Valiant, arranging to meet at 6: 30pm on Saturday 4th February, 2006.
we were later able to establish that Valiant was one of many identities or handles used by Alan Lane, whose fingerprints were also discovered on a glass on the victim's bedside table.
in his subsequent statement to the police,
lane said that when Mrs Jackson suggested they retire to the bedroom, he was offended by the idea, made his excuses, and left.
what is your opinion?
we suggest that instead of leaving he became violent and murdered her.
thank you.
no further questions.
detective Inspector, whilst I'm sure we all greatly appreciated your account...
I'm afraid in the end it amounted to nothing.
Why? Because you told us nothing new!
we know all that already.
we know there was no sign of forced entry and that Alan Lane was there that night.
his statement says as much.
we know that he had a drink of water in the sitting room with Holly Jackson and that subsequently she invited him upstairs.
his statement confirms that, too.
but what his statement also insists is that he never went into the bedroom.
so I would like to ask you about that glass of water. If I may?
you mean the one with his fingerprints on it?
found in the bedroom on a table beside the victim's dead body?
Yes.
that one.
were the only fingerprints found on that glass those belonging to the defendant?
no, of course not.
whose else were there? The victim's.
the victim's?
presumably she poured the glass of water for him.
he was her guest. And handed it over.
I see.
but if her fingerprints are on that glass, it could mean that she took the glass of water up to the room herself.
it could, but why would she have taken his glass?
she took it up to bed after he'd gone.
she was dead before he was gone.
the truth is you have nothing that actually places Lane in the bedroom upstairs.
we have a dead body, ma'am.
no, Detective Inspector, you have nothing.
not a single shred of forensic evidence that connects Alan Lane to Holly Jackson's body.
despite the best efforts of your colleagues in the past.
up yours, sister.
ms Watts, as Queen's Counsel you should know better.
sorry, my Lord.
we'll break there. Back at two o'clock, please.
clear the court. All rise.
never heard anything like it.
complete loss of discipline from you and the witness.
referencing the previous trial like that.
you should be ashamed of yourself!
any more of that and I will have no choice but to discharge the jury and you'll be left to bear the cost of the entire trial.
Yes, my Lord.
I'm just calling to confirm my appointment with Dr Barker at 5: 30.
excuse me, Ms Hawkins.
Yeah. I was in court with you just now.
I wondered do you have a business card? Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
generally it's safe, isn't it?
using an agency like yours? It's perfectly safe.
I can assure you.
thank you.
what was all that about, do you think?
in court just now between the defence counsel and the judge?
I know.
it felt like something everyone in that room knew about except for us.
that's exactly how it felt.
So...now, what do you think so far?
guilty? Not guilty?
just between us.
didn't they say we shouldn't discuss this?
well, what shall we discuss?
I'm assuming there's been no progress over you getting to America?
a letter arrived today.
I have an appointment for a visa application at the American Embassy.
good for you.
and if this goes well, you can join your brother in...
omaha, Nebraska.
omaha, Nebraska.
Where's that? It's the middle of nowhere, isn't it? Yes.
but its central location is also its virtue.
it's made the city an important national transportation hub.
is that so? With the world's largest artificial swamp.
and the city is the birthplace of numerous sports figures including 1960 Olympic gold medallist Bob Booza and Baseball Hall-of-Famer Bob Gibson.
Oh, wouldn't that be perfect?
clearly I can quite see why you want to turn your back on an inconsequential city like London with its Charles Dickens, Isaac Newton,
william Shakespeare, Karl Marx.
I mean, Olympic gold medallist Bob Boozer.
not to be sniffed at.
jam roly-poly today?
not for me.
me again.
can't keep away.
booth number four.
four.
excuse me.
I beg your pardon.
no, it was my fault. Are you all right?
I'm fine, sorry, I was miles away.
no, here, let me help you. Thanks.
actually I have an idea where you might have been in your thoughts.
I hope that isn't presumptuous.
I recognised you from court.
I've been in the public gallery.
it's all right, I'm not on one of the legal teams.
quite the opposite.
actually, I'm you.
I was a jury member.
in the first trial.
do you want brown or white bread with that?
and then when it went to appeal, and the verdict was overturned...
it was devastating.
I can imagine.
you'd have given it so much time.
invested so much of yourself.
so did you reach unanimity?
we did. Each of us, all 12, was absolutely certain he was guilty.
people with nothing in common, from all walks of life, speaking as one.
it was a very powerful...
actually moving experience.
and the idea that suddenly our voice, our judgement should count for nothing?
I can't speak for the others, but...
I found it almost violating.
of course.
we were just so invested.
so when it went to the Court of Appeal,
I went to.
every day.
my friends thought I was mad.
let it go, they said.
and then when the appeal was upheld and they ordered a retrial, I...
you started coming here every day, too?
Yes.
is that terrible?
not at all. Not at all.
I'm sure I'd have been exactly the same.
I can't imagine how I haven't noticed you.
Why?
there are a lot of people in a court room.
Yes, but none of them as...
well... Well, I noticed you.
look at the time. We should get back.
don't worry. I'll get this.
no, it's out of the question. I insist.
it can be your turn tomorrow.
all right.
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.
Natasha Williams.
Tasha. Paul Briarley.
Paul.
state your full name and rank, please.
Alison Jane Lowther.
and your occupation?
senior Engineer at the Operational Support Unit of the Metropolitan Police.
and your expertise lies in...
computer and cellular phone analysis.
is it true you were asked to analyse Alan Lane's computer and mobile telephone records?
in the case of the computer, we found evidence of a host of secret accounts, identities and false names, memberships or subscriptions to online dating agencies and e-mail exchanges with people he'd met through these agencies.
among them, all three victims.
and what did you discover from his mobile phone records?
well, we were able to clearly establish not only when the defendant's cell phone was being used, but also where.
at the house where Anna Knight, the second victim, was found, we collated data from the three nearest masts in the area.
here, here and here.
in a system of triangulation.
which, in this case, if you take these masts, pinpoints us to 23 Seven Sisters Street which is, of course, where the murder took place.
fascinating.
and having established his location, if one were to go one step further, and compare the times of Lane's phone calls with the time of Anna Knight's death, as established by the post mortem...
you would find a perfect match.
thank you.
no further questions.
what a fun.
I do love a good audiovisual presentation.
and what advances technology has made.
all these flat screens and gizmos and talk of triangulation.
by the way, are you aware of who that all-important one phone call was from?
no. His optician.
mr Lane had booked in his reading glasses for adjustment.
the frames had got loose.
and the call was to say that they were ready for collection.
I just thought that you might like to know that at the time he was allegedly violently killing a woman, he was, in fact, chatting.
for one minute, 36 seconds, to Mrs Bannerjee, about his glasses.
mr Bannerjee, his actual optician, was unwell that day.
my Lord... Nasty head cold.
ms Watts. Yes, sorry, my Lord.
back to your LCD triangulation thingy.
I'm curious.
does it place him in the hallway where the murder took place?
no, not specifically the hallway.
I see.
in the sitting room, then? No.
where then? Sorry, I'm unclear.
you said it "pinpoints" him. Yes.
so would that be upstairs or downstairs?
just to the house. The house!
feels a little general.
not "pinpointy" at all.
with respect... This doesn't bode well.
my father always told me that when people say, "With respect,"what they actually mean is "With contempt."
with respect...
if he's inside the house all alone with the victim at the time the murder took place, I don't see that this is relevant.
Really?
but if he's not inside the house?
and was parked in the street outside, sitting in his car, for example, talking to Mrs Bannerjee.
does your triangulating bells and whistles system manage to place him inside the house or not?
it place him at 23 Seven Sisters Street.
Yes, in the vicinity.
but does it place him inside the four walls?
in the hallway where the murder took place?
beyond all reasonable doubt?
yes or no?
no.
thank you. No further questions.
all right, dear, no more fun and games.
I call the next witness for the Crown.
your full name and rank, please.
detective Inspector Thomas Scott.
detective Inspector, what did you find when you went to investigate the murder of Rebecca Cheung?
my first observations were the victim was killed by asphyxiation by strangling.
she had pronounced bruising around her neck.
my other conclusions were that this was not a robbery.
you say this because? Her valuables were still on her person.
wallet, mobile telephone et cetera? Correct.
and when did you first come across the name of Alan Lane?
when the analysis of the victim's phone and computer came back.
of course, as soon as we discovered he was a suspect in connection with the murders of Holly Jackson and Anna Knight and that he was the last person to see Rebecca Cheung alive, we moved very quickly.
we entered the suspect's property at 5: 00am and arrested him.
took him back to the police station for interview.
how did the suspect's behaviour strike you?
I haven't done anything. Why won't you bloody well talk to me?
I'm innocent, do you hear me?
I'm fucking innocent!
he was extremely agitated.
repeatedly denied knowing or having ever met Rebecca Cheung.
I don't know any Rebecca!
I don't know any bloody Rebecca!
a lie disproved by the existence of e-mail exchanges...
I said I haven't done anything!
by testimony of several eye-witnesses that saw them at the pub the night before she died, and most compellingly by CCTV footage which clearly shows Lane and the victim leaving the pub at 9: 46.
here we see Lane and the victim in the park and appearing to walk in separate directions.
but now we see Lane walk a hundred or so yards.
get to the bus stop.
turning back when he gets to the bus stop.
hailing a minicab.
which then drives back in the direction which the victim was going.
here we see how the cab passes the victim here.
if we're driving ahead, we see the brake lights of the taxi.
before stopping here where Lane got out of the taxi, lay in wait for the victim, before killing her and dumping her body on the common.
which, as the map shows, is only a short distance away.
thank you. No further questions.
detective Inspector, I wonder have you ever been out at night after hours?
and tried to get a cab home?
not recently. Well, I have.
and I can tell you, never any about.
especially when it's raining. Drives you mad.
but there are often minicabs.
unlicensed, most of them.
they pull up beside you, wind their window down and ask if you want a ride home.
and because it's cold and because it's dark, you relent, ask them how much, give them your postcode, and they quote some ludicrous price and you think, "You must be joking. I'd sooner walk.
sooner get pneumonia.
what's your point, Ms Watts?
well, my point, my Lord, is that despite all these advances in high-definition technology, and despite us all being able to see the footage clear as a bell,
I missed the bit where the defendant actually hailed the taxi or got into it or did anything other than speak to the driver through the window.
the cameras work on a time lapse.
well, that may be.
but in a court of law, we do not work on evidence lapse.
and since we never see him get in, how do we know it's actually him in the taxi driving past the victim and waiting for her up ahead?
because he's not at the bus stop when the taxi pulls away.
he is not at that bus stop.
because he got on that bus.
very convenient.
Yeah.
and also true.
Really? Where's the proof of that?
sounds like evidence lapse to me.
no further questions.
this feels like a good place to break.
we've overrun as it is. Tomorrow morning, please, ten o'clock.
all rise.
nothing worse than a lippy copper, right, Emma?
I'll see you then.
well, I can confirm what you probably already know.
do you have any idea how far gone you might be?
I think we should probably get a scan.
so we know exactly.
of course.
Rashid?
Rashid!
how was your day, Mum?
it was fine.
I read the...
the new Booker prize winner from cover to cover.
I tidied the garden.
took the neighbour's dogs for a walk.
I jumped on the bus.
went to a lunchtime concert at the Wigmore Hall.
and all without leaving my bed.
you know,
Oscar Wilde said, "The tragedy of growing old is not that you grow old, it's that you stay young in here.
you think if the brain slowed down at the same speed as the body, it would be so much more bearable?
this way I'm still fully conscious of a handsome, newly single man wasting his life looking after his decrepit old mother.
I'm not. Don't be...
you should be out there restoring your faith in the fairer sex, not locked up at home with me.
well... I um...
I'm doing my best.
what does that mean?
well, I told you this was a retrial.
yes?
I met someone today from the previous jury.
who is now watching from the public gallery.
we're gonna have lunch tomorrow. Good.
is she bonny?
she is.
bright enough for you? Yes, yes, that too.
and no indication that she's gonna suddenly up sticks and disappear to some religious cult in Germany?
a yogic community, Mum.
and, no.
not yet.
good for you.
we'll see.
but these aren't the figures we discussed.
I'll get rid of that.
I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm actually going to have to take this.
Lucy.
I can't talk now. No, we need to meet tomorrow morning.
impossible. I'm with the lawyers again tomorrow morning.
bollocks to the lawyers. This is more important.
dear Alan...
I am writing to you as someone who has spent eight hours in close proximity with you today.
I feel an overwhelming desire to make contact with you as a human being and as a child of God.
I write to you with only good intentions...
dear Ann, how nice to receive your letter after a tough day in court, and how brave of you to send it.
in answer to your question, yes,
I am a returning child of God.
back in his arms again after too long outside his protection.
my mother brought me up with a strong faith and the years without it brought me nothing but misery.
how I wished I'd had that faith with me in those lonely years when I first moved to London.
let's hope those years of loneliness and heartache will now finally be over.
now, enough about me.
tell me about yourself.
I'm intrigued to know more about you.
tell me more about your faith, about your journey to the light.
now it's late.
tomorrow will be another long day.
but I will keep my eyes open and look out for you.
I'm sure I'll recognise you when I see you.
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
I wish you peace, strength and hope.
have faith, Alan.
you're in my prayers.
God bless.
Ann.
again!
you ever done anything like that? Like what?
dating sites. Sure.
I call the defendant, Alan Lane.
do you think it's a coincidence that since Alan Lane has been in custody there have been no more murders?
please go, go, go!
I have another explanation for that, Commander, and we will come to it.
how can I trust you not to tell anyone?
I never tell on my friends... Are we? Friends?
but I've got one or two surprises up my sleeve.
this was an investigation that robbed an innocent man of his freedom!
what went before matters not.
it is your duty to try this case on the evidence you hear in this court alone.
jail, Theresa! For getting you off jury service.
do you have any idea how far gone you might be?
I'm assuming there's been no progress over your getting to America?
I have an appointment for a visa application at the US Embassy.
generally, it's safe, isn't it, to use an agency like yours?
it's perfectly safe. I met someone today.
Natasha Williams. Paul Brierley.
is she bonny? She is.
I was a jury member.
in the first trial.
the time is just about eight minutes past seven, and this is James Naughtie.
ahead of tomorrow's House of Commons vote on the Jury Abolition Bill, we're going to talk about the sensitive question of trial by jury.
and joining us now in the studio is Lewis Jenkins QC.
good morning. The Minister for Justice, Eleanor Duncan, is making her case for the abolition of juries on the grounds of cost and efficiency.
but also on the ground that jurors are somehow unable to appreciate some of the legal arguments, the jargon, perhaps.
well, with great respect,
I think that is somewhat insulting to people who've served on juries.
breakfast's ready!
I've made you some porridge. I'll be right there.
the jury has collective instincts. They have intelligents.
their life experience of twelve is totally different.
they come from all walks of life they selected by random.
I thought you said it was forbidden to do your own research in the trial.
it is.
I'm not researching the trial.
I'm researching a juror.
thank you very much.
when I need you, I will call you back.
Yes, please. Next customer?
at the Philadelphia Convention, delegates from 12 states...
Rhode Island chose not to attend...
met to amend the articles of confederation.
but, as the convention progressed, it was decided to draft a new constitution which required only nine of the 13 states to ratify it.
heading off now, Mum.
see you later.
mum? Oh, God.
Oh, God.
mum!
it's all right, it's all right.
stay where you are, stay where you are.
it was a triple homicide. A man called Alan Lane murdered three professional women he met on internet dating sites.
it was all over the media back home.
home always then being England?
right. I moved to Vancouver two years ago.
anyway, the real trauma happened afterwards.
what did happen afterwards?
they took it to the Court of Appeal. Irregularities were uncovered.
our verdict was thrown out, just like that.
but you were the foreman of this jury, right?" "Right."
it was devastating.
just devastating.
at first, we thought they'd made a mistake.
we wanted to let the authorities know about his condition and get him exempted for his own sake.
rashid didn't want that. Not at all. He was adamant.
"it's my trial," he said. So he went.
and how's that been? Amazing.
he's obsessed, works on it all hours.
researching it, studying it.
he's up there on his computer morning and night.
as you know, obsessive interest in something is typical of Asperger's.
just keep an eye on his manageability...sleep.
make sure he gets enough of it, eats regularly.
it's a fine balance. We want him to be engaged.
we don't want him to crash and burn.
of course, of course. We understand.
look, the fact is, she'll be admitted, and they'll probably spend most of the day doing a chest X-ray and blood tests.
I'd say, give...A&E Reception a call around four o'clock.
they'll tell you what ward she's in.
mum. Mum, are you sure you don't want me to come?
darling, I'll be fine.
we've been here plenty of times before.
you just carry on with your day as normal.
you've got more important things to do. Mum, believe me, this sort of thing happens to jurors all the time. The trial can wait.
I'm not talking about the trial.
I'm talking about...about your lunch.
I can see you've made an effort.
now, go on.
you'll be late.
and for God's sake, don't tell her you're living with your mother.
Yeah. Hey. It's me.
global warming. Myth or reality?
what? You heard. Which?
Lucy...I haven't got time for this.
I've got another session with the lawyers.
it's important. Yeah. Well, not as important as...
Oh...Myth!
america. Global leader or global scourge?
what is this? Leader.
doctors. Should they be allowed to assist suicide on compassionate grounds? What?!
Erm...no. Yes!
I don't know. Which?
Erm...no.
no. And finally...
Simon Cowell or David Beckham. Who would you rather?
Simon Cowell.
Wow!
all right. And at the end of the quick-fire round, we score zero.
which means...we're in even deeper shit than I thought.
leaving.
Why? Think about it.
you're the juror here, not me.
yours was the name that was selected, not mine.
so? So...yours is the only opinion that matters.
it's bad enough me impersonating you.
but misrepresenting you takes it to a whole new level.
what if it's a hung jury and yours is the casting vote?
someone's life is effectively at stake.
what are you saying?
you're the person whose opinion and vote counts.
we need to make sure it's your opinion that gets delivered.
well, how do we do that? I'm busy. We make time.
I fill you in on everything, then you vote.
I can't do this.
you've got a visitor.
everything all right?
big day for you today. I'll be fine.
how do you think it's gone so far?
it felt like we've been getting a bit of a kicking recently.
well, that's...pretty normal for this stage in the process.
and I quite like this jury.
and I get the feeling...
more importantly, that they quite like us.
Ergh! My Blackberry. I can't...switch it off.
so.
dsi Babyface
he's Commander Babyface now, if you please.
grown up. Must be all of 35.
cocky twat.
Well...if that's what he's like, that could be good for us.
Plus, they no longer have that piece of evidence.
and given the role that one of his babyface own officers played in that, it may put him on the back foot.
but I've got one or two surprises up my sleeve.
they're not the only ones who've been busy since the first trial, you know.
drives me bloody mad!
right. I'll see you in there.
sorry.
mr Mallory.
state your full name and rank, please.
commander Neil Howson, Metropolitan Police.
commander.
may I start today by congratulating you on your recent promotion?
promotions.
at the time of the murders, however, you were a superintendent?
detective Superintendent. That's correct.
could you please tell the court when you first came across the name Alan Lane?
it would've been early 2006, when he became the prime suspect in the murders of Holly Jackson, Anna Knight and Rebecca Chung.
why, in your opinion, had Alan Lane become the prime suspect?
because the evidence we gathered showed that he was, by some margin, the clearest common denominator between all three victims.
so you arrested him and brought him in for interview.
and the decision to charge him with all three murders came when?
within a few hours of questioning.
with a clear discrepancy between his version of events and events we could establish beyond doubt.
in other words, when he lied to you.
correct.
in a...high profile case, such as this, operating in the glare of the media, when police work comes under scrutiny， and there is a real pressure for a swift conviction...
there is often a nail-biting time for police when they...wonder...whether they really got...the right man.
did you ever feel this?
if you're asking, have I ever felt that before, yes.
did I feel it in this case? Never. Not for a second.
in fact, rarely have I slept better.
I am perfectly...100% satisfied we got the right man.
thank you.
no further questions.
good morning, Commander...Howson.
morning.
let me start by adding my congratulations to those of my learned friend.
detective Inspector, Detective Superintendent,
detective Chief Superintendent.
the word meteoric hardly does it justice.
thank you.
and congratulations too for acting so swiftly in arresting Mr Lane.
you know, it's such a relief when people do what they're hired to do.
get things done. My Lord?
it's true, isn't it, that you were hired amid considerable controversy, aged 29...to replace a Detective Inspector who had let a very high profile murder investigation of a young mother drag on.
come to the point, Ms Watts.
the point, My Lord, is that the then Detective Superintendent Howson would never make the same mistake.
allow a Metropolitan Police investigation to drift.
or allow his superiors to be hauled over the coals in the media.
he knew what side his bread was buttered.
and he was going to arrest someone.
and save public lives.
or do you think it's a coincidence that, since Alan Lane has been in custody, there have been no further murders in the area matching the same MO?
not a coincidence.
I have another explanation for that, Commander.
and we will come to it.
shortly.
in the meantime,
I believe I'm the one asking the questions.
you said that Lane was the only common denominator between the three victims.
no, that's not what I said.
I believe if you check the record, I said 'the clearest.'
so you are aware that there were other men who had enjoyed communication with all three victims.
I am aware there were one or two.
well, as it happens, there were six.
and among them...
one...Thomas...Dent.
does the name mean anything to you? Of course.
then you will be aware that not only did he have extensive e-mail and telephone contact with all three of the women, but he also had a history of domestic violence substance abuse and mental instability.
but perhaps more significantly, he was known to police as someone who had regularly visited dogging sites.
it's especially relevant in this case, as the woodland where the third victim was murdered,
Huntley Common, is a known dogging site.
well, I can assure you Mr Dent was thoroughly investigated.
apparently, not thoroughly enough.
because nowhere in your report, or charge, did you make the connection that all three victims had shown an interest in, or had histories of sexual exhibitionism.
I'm sure my officers were perfectly aware.
well, if they were aware, Commander, then it follows that you would be able to provide the court with the name of the website where all three women communicated most frequently...with Mr Dent.
I'm quite sure I can.
no, no. Let me spare your blushes.
mischiefmatch. com... is the name of the site where the victims all met Thomas Dent.
yet there is barely mention of him in your police report.
why is that? We ruled him out.
and anyway, if he is such a compelling suspect, why don't you summon him?
because he's dead...Commander.
he took his own life.
he was found hanging from a doorway in his apartment less than two months after the death of Rebecca Chung.
his computer...at the time of death...was still logged on...to mischiefmatch. com.
in the light of all of this,
commander Howson, do you still feel 100% certain that you arrested the right man?
Absolutely.
Really?
thank you. No further questions.
thank you, Ms Watts. Two o'clock, please.
all rise!
Taxi!
you're not eating?
not hungry.
how could I be after what I discovered this morning?
I did a little research after our chat last time on...Omaha, Nebraska.
you see, I couldn't quite figure out why your brother had gone there of all the wonderful places available to him in America.
well, then I...I found out.
that's where they're all sent.
who? Refugees.
from Sudan.
there's a whole community of you there.
Yes.
10, 000. Among them, half my village.
dear boy...why didn't you say?
a few of us were lucky.
we heard them coming.
the sound.
their horses and their laughter.
Oh, the...the rebels. The...Janjaweed?
we didn't wait to see them. We just ran.
out into the bush.
me and my two brothers.
behind us in the village they killed all the men and boys.
including my father.
we covered our ears, but we heard the gunshots.
and then they raped all the women.
including...
we covered our ears, but we heard the screams.
in the bush, there were other boys...from other villages.
and we started to walk.
in the beginning, we were 12.
when we arrived at the camps we were five.
when the Americans came a year later, we were just three.
but your brothers?
one made it...one did not.
I'm so very sorry.
Why...England?
before me was a plane to America.
it was my brother.
they said another plane was going to follow, but...
the plane was to England.
and your brother went to Omaha, Nebraska.
with others from my village.
well, you'll get there soon.
Yes. Inshallah.
I hope.
apple meringue today.
OK. OK.
I will if you will. Good.
there's your token.
and your towel. Booth number four.
thank you. Cheers, love.
would you like to know the sex?
eventually, yes.
would you like to know today?
how? You can't possibly tell.
why not?
isn't it too soon? Don't you have to wait until...
how far gone am I?
well, looking at these measurements, I'd say...
18, 19 weeks. What?
and if I don't want to go through with it?
if it's...totally impractical?
that's a decision you're going to have to make quickly.
how quickly?
your mother's comfortable and the doctor says she's stable. Okay.
we'll call if there's any change.
uh...All right.
well, thank you.
thank you. I'll call you back later. Thanks.
Hi.
Hi. I'm...sorry if I kept you waiting.
no, not at all.
so. Tell me about your fellow jurors.
the gang.
the Liquorice Allsorts.
well, that's how I like to think of them.
it's hard to say, really.
the only time we really spend together is in court.
and then it's mostly in silence, so...
do you get any idea how they feel?
about Lane?
that's something we haven't discussed.
you know how strict they are on that sort of thing.
Mm. Of course.
but not even an inkling?
no.
but for me a lot changed this morning.
up until today, it was hard to believe he could ever be innocent.
but hearing that stuff about the other man...
you know? Thomas Dent?
interesting. Right.
and I think we all like her.
his barrister. Yes, she's quite a character.
Mm. Always a little ripple of excitement in the jury box whenever she gets up.
it just shows you the difference a good barrister makes.
because right now, it's hard to imagine us returning the same unanimous verdict you did.
well, there's another critical difference between our trial and yours that you don't know about.
and not just a new barrister.
or should I say tiny...difference?
Microscopic...difference.
but I'm not in a position to tell you what that is.
strict confidentiality, and so forth.
ruled inadmissible by the Court of Appeal.
I understand. And anyway...
how can I trust you not to tell anyone?
well, I never tell on my friends. But I completely understand.
are we?
friends?
well, I...I hope so.
or could become so.
sorry.
was that very presumptuous?
no. Good.
OK? It's time.
remember, head up.
look directly into my eyes.
speak loudly and clearly and unapologetically.
OK? You're gonna be fine.
right.
I call the defendant...Alan Lane.
I swear by almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Good luck.
give the court your name, please.
alan Dennis Lane.
and your last known address, before your arrest?
32 Oak Park Gardens,
london, SW17.
have you always lived in London?
no. Er...I come from Hull.
Or...Hell, as I like to call it.
sound where we are going.
so, what brought you south? I couldn't get work.
and my dad wasn't too well.
but there was another reason too, wasn't there?
Sandra got a job down here.
Sandra being your girlfriend at the time. That's right.
so one might say you came to London for love.
that were the idea, but...it didn't work out like that.
it wasn't long before Sandra met someone else at work and...
and before I knew it...she wanted out.
and me out of the flat.
I got into a bit of a state.
in fact, you...you suffered a reactive clinical depression, as your medical records show.
brought on by the shock of your girlfriend's rejection and your being made homeless.
you were...you were put on medication.
did it help?
it helped with the moods, but...
it didn't help socially.
why was that?
well, the thing about the pills is, you can't mix 'em with drink.
so that immediately limits the kind of places you can go to to meet people.
so, what did you do?
I went on the net. Like inloveinlondon...
dot com, whose managing director we heard from yesterday.
Yes. So how was that?
well, it's fine, as long as you're not expecting to find actual romance.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
no-one's serious.
it...it's just one big free for all.
everyone's just looking for erm...
what?
I can't. I'm sorry.
you know.
I can't.
sex?
Yeah. That's right.
that's right. Yes.
as opposed to...committed relationships.
Yes. Like Holly Jackson?
a woman you believed was looking for companionship.
a proper relationship. She said so in her e-mails.
and an exchange developed between the two of you, culminating in her suggestion of a meeting.
tell the court what happened next. When I got to the house, she opened the door.
it were a bit of a shock. Why was that?
Well...she were attractive all right, but she was different to what I'd imagined or hoped for. How?
just the way she were dressed. You know. She...
she obviously wasn't shy.
anyway...
I went into her front room and she offered me a glass of wine.
I said no...because of the medication.
water'd be fine. She seemed disappointed at that.
the fact that you...weren't drinking.
I got the impression that she might've already had a few glasses herself.
anyway, all of a sudden, she makes her move and suggests that we go upstairs.
well, I followed her up. And then I saw the room from the landing.
I told her. I felt uncomfortable.
I wanted no further part.
so you never actually entered the bedroom, where she was subsequently found.
never. No. I were out the door and gone.
with...with cheap insults ringing in my ears.
but with Anna Knight...the story was different.
Yeah. That were different.
I felt there were a connection, right from the first e-mail.
including when we met.
so, when she didn't respond to my e-mails or my text messages afterwards,
I couldn't understand it.
I wrote her e-mail after e-mail without getting a reply.
and then I...I did something that I now deeply regret.
which was?
I killed her
I followed her.
and this was on...the 2nd of March 2006.
that's right. Yeah.
She...she went to show a house...
where the buyer, a man, was waiting.
did you see this man?
no. His back were turned to me.
and my view was blocked at that moment by a bus.
this would be the number 42, Mr Mallory, which when it stops, is directly in the defendant's line of sight, given that we know the car was parked here, the bus stops here, and here...is number 23.
can you describe him? White, tall, dark hair In a suit. Is there anything else that struck you? Because it is my firm belief...
that this was Thomas Dent.
no. Like I said, his back were turned to me and...
and then my phone rang.
Mrs Banerjee. That's right.
telling me my glasses were ready for collection.
what time would you say that was?
Oh, I...I dunno. Three?
3: 30?
so, where were you when you took this call? In my car.
which was parked where?
outside 23 Seven Sisters Street.
were you ever in the house that day?
Oh, I never got out of my car.
so, not in the house at the time of the murder.
nor were you in the bedroom where Holly Jackson was murdered.
nor were you ever on Huntley Common in the woodland, where the third victim Rebecca Chung's body was found.
no. But you did know Rebecca Chung.
and you had been for a drink with her at the Green Man Pub the night before.
correct. Yet, when you were subsequently interviewed by police you denied it. Why?
gosh, she's a liar.
Shh! I were confused.
20 policemen had just stormed into my house at 5AM.
I were taken down to the police station.
everyone's talking about three women being killed.
I haven't done anything!
in connection with the first two, they'd got my name...
I don't know any bloody Rebecca!
they'd got my text messages, they'd got my e-mails.
so in connection with the third, I just panicked.
I started denying everything I could.
out of self-preservation.
Yes.
if you had your chance again in that police interview what would you say?
I'd say...
Yes. I did meet Rebecca Chung for a drink at the Green Man Pub on the 29th of March 2006.
for an hour.
but we didn't click.
you know? Sometimes it just goes that way.
so...we said goodbye, and we went our separate ways.
and you didn't hail some minicab and double back and lie in wait for her and kill her.
no.
I do remember him stopping, though.
he wanted 15 quid to take me home. It was a bloody joke.
excuse me.
but you didn't get in.
no.
so, why weren't you in the CCTV footage one minute later?
because a bus came.
a bus came. Yeah.
well, that's what generally happens when you wait at a bus stop.
Yeah. Thank you.
no further questions.
well, well, well...
mr Lane.
Yes, I'm sure none of us can wait, Mr Mallory.
but let's do this tomorrow morning. 10: 00, please.
Yes, My Lord.
all rise!
OK. I'll be at yours for 7: 30. You might wanna get some food in, too.
Rashid?
can I help you, love? Oh, yes.
I'm here to see my mother.
june Brierley.
I'll...see if I can find someone to come and...have a talk with you.
thanks for doing this.
I can't believe I am.
so he goes on the internet, looking to find a monogamous relationship.
but the problem is, none of the women are looking for love.
right. They're looking for a good shag.
right. Then, when he discovers that...
instead of skipping for joy, like any normal bloke, he feels deeply betrayed, loses his temper and kills them.
doesn't sound like any man I've met.
if you saw him, you'd understand.
he's like a big, wounded, needy baby.
Agh! Give me a nasty, cold-hearted philanderer any day.
have you ever done anything like that? Like what?
dating sites. Sure.
Yeah. I must say, I've always been sneakily tempted.
cos otherwise, who do you end up dating in life? People from the office.
from the gym, friends of friends.
I mean, basically, people right under your nose.
Where's the surprise or the romance in that?
Romeo Boy. That's me.
I hope you don't mind the photo. It is me, I promise.
well, it was. Once.
Well...do you want a drink?
I'm sorry. I think I should go.
what? This is a mistake.
well, make up your mind, love!
do you think I live in central London?
It's...I've come all the way from bloody Orpington.
it's taken me an hour to get here!
Er...I'm sorry.
taxi?!
sir, please go. Just go. I'll tell you the address.
our Father...which art in heaven hallowed be thy name.
thy kingdom come...thy will be done on Earth...as it is in Heaven.
give us this day our daily bread...
and forgive us our trespasses...
as we forgive them that trespass against us.
lead us not into temptation.
but deliver us from evil.
for thine is the kingdom...the power and the glory...
Amen.
good night.
mr Takana? Takana.
and...?
he did do it, didn't he? Is that what you think?
isn't it what YOU think? That's not the point.
what are you here?
just thought I'd offer you a few dos and don'ts in case things get especially rough today.
are they likely to? Yeah.
it was ruled inadmissible. That piece of evidence.
but you don't think it should've been. No.
it could change everything. What do I do, Mum?
last season on AMC's The Killing...
the car belongs to the Richmond's campaign.
city Councilman Richmond?
want to do something about that Richmond?
just say the word and we'll take care of it.
every piece of this place hurts me...
he met Rosie six months ago at a campaign rally.
his campaign advisor gave up the tape, also his alibi.
security cam caught Richmond making the crossing Saturday morning.
we got him, boss.
you're under arrest for the murder of Rosie Larsen.
you're making a big mistake.
where is Mitch?
she left.
the photo worked, he's going down.
this is Highway Patrol, the cameras on that bridge have been out of service.
the details are unclear, but information continues to pour in on this shocking story.
you ready?
look at me.
I'm sorry. Sometimes things just don't wk out.
are we staying for good this time?
Yes. You'll see all your friends, stay in the same school.
it'll be just like it used to be.
is the real reason we're staying 'cause that guy's dead?
the one you arrested.
in breaking news tonight, a lone gunman opened fire outside the city jail while police were transporting Councilman Darren Richmond.
eyewitnesses have described the shooter as a while male, but other details remain unclear.
as information continues to pour in on this story, we will keep you informed.
somebody get the key!
take off his cuffs!
all right, on 3. Up on 3. 1, 2,3.
I'm going with him!
all right, we're clear!
go, go, go!
the photo... It was faked.
I think... I think that Rosie's killer is still out there.
you know what this means... For the department... You, me. My God.
what if Richmond's innocent?
you don't know that.
I'll talk to DA Niilson. She trusts me.
she knows I wouldn't go to her if I didn't have to.
what are you gonna say?
that a photo putting Richmond on the bridge the same night Rosie was killed was faked?
by a cop, no less?
if somebody wanted Richmond to take the fall that bad
it doesn't mean he didn't do it!
I mean, really, what do you have?
a phone call in the middle of the night?
so, we let it go? Is that it?
I don't believe this!
I shouldn't have come here.
look, sit! Just-- just sit.
you and I are the only ones who know about that photo.
let me look into it. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
holder couldn't have done this on his own.
who assigned him to homicide?
I told you-- His former supervisor at county.
what's his name?
he's been a narc for 20 years, Sheriff's Department.
Lou, sheriff's department oversees Bridges and tunnels-- The cameras on them.
so now this is a conspiracy?
the body in the campaign car and now the photo?
what if Richmond was set up from the very beginning?
what if Rosie was just part of something bigger?
it's just like the last time... ...when you got sick.
holder lied to me.
all right.
let Jack sleep.
you be careful.
you mind?
you got that Richmond photo real quick, yo.
Yeah.
your connects in county paid off.
I'm impressed.
guys like Richmond-- They never pay.
it's about time.
no doubt.
you did good.
you got a long career ahead... And all the shiny things that come with it.
holder.
what?
his moms, too?
Richmond's been shot.
we got Belko Royce's mother.
the assailant has been identified as an employee of the Larsens.
Belko Royce allegedly shot Councilman Richmond as he was being transported from police headquarters only hours after allegedly gunning down... ...His own mother, Beverly Royce.
the Councilman was set to be transferred...
Stan, there's someone downstairs.
...from city holding to county jail.
so, they got Belko up at police headquarters, and they'll be transporting him to county jail tomorrow night.
Mr. Larsen, there's something about Rosie's case that you should know.
maybe Mrs. Larsen should be here, too.
m-my wife's not feeling well.
whatever you got to say, just say it.
Rosie met Richmond... on an online service.
an online service? What kind of service?
beau Soleil. It's an escort service.
no.
sorry. I... I wanted to let you know before the press does.
you got that wrong.
look, I'll walk you downstairs.
we got him, Mr. Larsen.
we got him.
he sustained a gunshot wound to the abdomen, the bullet pierced his stomach and the gastric artery.
we're gonna need to contact Mr. Richmond's next of kin.
he's got a sister in Boston, Elyse. I put in a call.
how is he?
well, if I can stop the internal bleeding, he may still bleed out from the incision.
I have to go.
what does that mean?
that sister should be on a plane... now.
what the hell...
Seattle PD.
got a question about the cameras on Desolation Bridge.
night October 5th.
cameras on that bridge have been out of service since August.
I need to get printed confirmation.
wait here.
sorry for the inconvenience, but you were misinformed.
the cameras on Desolation Bridge are in operation.
he just said they were broken.
new guy, not familiar with the system.
bullshit.
I got a call from your offices earlier tonight, and that guy just said the same thing.
if you'd like me to call your lieutenant,
detective Linden, I'd be happy to.
I never gave you my name.
why don't you take a seat? I'll give him a call.
who were you talking to?
Jack. Jack. We got to go.
what? - Shh. Come on.
Why? - Get your shoes on.
watch your fingers, baby.
day FOURTEEN
there he is! There he is! Jamie! Jamie!
the Councilman is in surgery right now.
we don't know in what condition, so I certainly can't comment on
Jamie, is Richmond withdrawing from the race?
we're talking about a man's life here, Dan.
I'm not speaking on the election.
did he confess to murdering Rosie Larsen?
no. Because he didn't do it.
when is he gonna... - We're finished.
you should be ashamed!
that's what I should have told the parasites.
unbelievable.
what? What did they say?
no, nothing. No one's told me anything.
he had an alibi. He was with you.
how do the police think he did this?
any word on Mr. Richmond's sister?
not yet. She's on the East Coast.
how is he?
is the Councilman a religious man?
Why?
in case he'd want a pastor, priest, or rabbi here-- For last rites.
simply a cautionary measure.
let me know if you hear from his sister.
well, what the hell is going on?
we've been waiting all night. No one has told us anything.
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to wait for Dr. Madigan.
you got your talking points, Mr. Mayor?
press are here, panties all in a twist.
any word on Richmond?
critical condition, still in surgery.
I didn't want to win this way.
the Richmond campaig has not released a statement regarding the Councilman's condition.
are we going back to Regi's?
no, she's still in the San Juans.
then where are we going?
are you hungry?
I just want chips.
Jack, you're eating too much junk. You got to eat something real.
Hello? Chips are, like, potatoes.
mom... Where are we going?
Emily? I really appreciate this.
Oh, don't mention it.
Nick is so excited Jack's joining us today.
you boys should go in.
pastor Dan's leading Bible study this morning, and he doesn't like tardy teens.
he's welcome to spend the day. Pick him up whenever you like.
just no later than 8: 00. It's a school night.
thanks again. I'll call you later.
it's the best I could do. Sorry.
you'll be safe here.
safe from what?
have fun. I'll pick you up in a few hours.
the DA's looking to fry your ass, Belko.
so if you got anything to say, now's the time to say it.
you hear?
why you did it.
hell, I would have, too.
a man can only take so much, right?
Bev never letting up.
and there comes Richmond... Killing that sweet little girl.
if that was me, whew.
I would have gone for the head shot.
make a statement.
you ain't no killer, Belko.
just trying to make it right.
right?
the world.
everything in it.
I feel you.
I do.
Hey, look me.
Belko, look at me.
look at me.
you're not the only one that knows you did right.
he's here? He knows?
Yeah. Sure. He knows.
cause I-I got to tell him... I got to tell him why, okay?
I got to tell Stan why.
okay? - Okay.
okay. I got to tell him. - Yeah.
boys are ready.
I told them you were going down to the warehouse.
good. I'll meet you at the diner after I go see Belko.
don't be blaming yourself for that, Stan.
you couldn't have known.
Denny's been asking about Mitch.
I told him that she was going to my mom's house, but I don't think that he believed me.
what are we gonna tell them, Stan?
have you heard from her yet?
maybe you should call her.
well, did you at least leave a message?
Yeah, like a hundred of them.
finally, you're ready.
I'm starving. Let's go.
Where's mom, dad?
put your hat on, buddy. It's cold out there.
what are you boys gonna order? Let's go.
miss, miss, did you know Belko Royce was going to shoot roe's killer?!
Terry, get them inside!
okay, go upstairs. Go upstairs. Go upstairs. Go upstairs.
go home, take a nap. I'll stay.
no, no. You go. You should go.
you should have seen him last night.
he was on fire. They loved him.
where were you?
something I ate... My stomach... I'm not sure.
don't you have a cat to feed or something?
I thought you had a pet.
I had a goldfish once.
too much commitment.
so I guess a girlfriend's out of the picture.
Yeah. Relationships are too much work.
better to be a garden-variety asexual, you know?
I should try that.
was he faithful to her?
it all makes sense.
he loved her.
I'm looking for Lieutenant Gil Sloane.
he worked a narc job that intersects with a drug bust I'm on for the city.
lieutenant Sloane retired two months ago.
you got a number I could catch him at?
you'll have to talk to my lieutenant.
he's out to lunch.
what's your name?
detective Sally Hayes.
I'll come by later. When's he back?
who knows? Guy does what he pleases.
don't they all?
linden here.
I just talked to Jack.
he said you were taking him to California?
Greg, it doesn't matter. Change of plans.
you can't just move my son to another state without telling me.
I didn't realize you were so interested in your son's living arrangements, a son you haven't seen for 10 years.
Sarah, if something's going on with you, I want to help, okay? I'm his fa
Hi, I'm Nadine. I'm the greeter for this meeting.
Sally. Hi.
I'm looking for Gil. Is he coming to the meeting?
might show up later.
stick around. You're in the right place.
Hey, do you have his number?
I, uh... I lost it, and, uh, I'm in a really bad place right now.
Gil got me clean, and I really need to talk to him.
it's bad, you know?
phone list is next to the coffee.
Thanks.
What'd you say your name was again?
Sally. Thanks for the help.
meeting's about to start, folks.
have a seat.
welcome to serenity in the steps, the Sunday morning meeting of narcotics anonymous.
Yeah. Name's Gil Sloane. I'll need his home address.
it should be listed.
mom.
I didn't realize Bible study was such a party.
Bible study sucked. Don't get mad, but, uh...
where are you, Jack? - He said I should call you.
who did?
holder. I'm with him.
what's up, Linden? Where you at?
Hey, mom. - Oh, snap.
what's up, Linden? Busted.
you're like that monster in "Friday the 13th "
only way to kill you is to chop off your head.
I was only kidding.
you know you're my BFF.
we got to go, Jack.
I'm not hanging out with those Jesus freaks.
you know anything about the man?
I mean, JC did all kinds of righteous shit.
get your stuff. Come on.
I got to go to the bathroom.
I'll go with you.
God, mom, quit freakin'.
you want to wipe his boo-boo, too?
I called you about Richmond.
Yeah, I was busy getting us another flight.
we missed ours last night.
A? - Yeah. You left a mess.
looks like we both did.
what Belko did ain't on us.
that's one way of looking at it.
so... Why you back? For real?
come on. Let's go.
take care, okay?
later. - Later, man.
bet you're gonna get that same psycho swardess you yelled at so you could get off that plane.
Yeah, and good luck cleaning up the mess.
I hope it was worth it.
don't you ever do that again.
what?
was that Sarah? Is she back?
she's leaving. What's up, Ray?
blowup she requested a week ago-- Super-8 film.
Rosie riding her bike.
Sarah thought there might have been a guy's face in the mirror, but best I could do was a tattooed arm.
it was in the mirror on Rosie's bike.
some kind of Japanese cartoon.
not exactly the Councilman's style, right?
Thanks, Ray.
landlord's kicking me out of my place today, babe.
said you stiffed him on the rent.
you must have forgot, right? To pay the rent?
why aren't you calling me back?
you know, this is driving me crazy.
it's making me nuts.
please call me, okay?
please. Just call me.
Hey, Terry.
Hey, Sta,boys want a snack or something?
that detective called-- Said Belko isn't doing so good. I should go.
Yeah, I'll hold down the fort, you know.
I'll fight 'em off with my bare hands.
most of the reporters are gone anyway.
you sure?
I'm cool. Go. Geez, get out of here already.
I'm good.
you know, I'm gonna need some help around here, what with Mitch... You know.
of course, Stan. Whatever you need. You know that.
if you could swing it, maybe you could stay here a while.
I mean, till she gets back if-- if you don't mind.
I don't mind.
okay.
that's his surgeon.
Why's he going to the or when he was there already?
maybe he had to go find his Maserati keys in some patient's small bowel.
he wasn't with me... the night the Larsen girl died.
he left.
when he came back, he was soaking wet.
he said he got caught in the rain, but it didn't rain that night.
Gwen... - Where was he?
that doesn't mean anything.
I told the police.
I need to go out for a while, Jack.
okay.
you can spend the night with Nick?
Nick's a dick.
Hello?
I can't talk to you right now.
I don't care if he called you.
he's fine, we're fine, and that's all you need to know.
I got to go.
I know these last two weeks have been hard on you, and I'm really sorry.
but everything's going back to normal, how used to be.
maybe I should hang out with my dad till everything goes back to normal.
don't take out all your clothes.
we won't be in this place very long.
why can't I stay with him?
because you're my son, and you belong with me.
this is our home, not there or anywhere else-- Here.
for 11 years, we made this life together, and I won't give that up.
I won't give you up, Jack. You're my son.
are you hungry?
you look hungry.
Hey, do you think I can get something else?
do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Yes.
I love you.
me too, mom.
adding to the collection?
do I look like some lame-ass comic fanboy to you?
the Larsen case.
this is the guy she was riding bikes with.
ain't that sweet? Let's go.
blue plate special at Denny's runs out in 20, so come on.
Hey, Linden's back.
she lied about why.
why would she do that?
the gal with the control issues?
got no idea.
heads up.
Oakes gave me the honors.
you earned it.
big leagues, bro.
you a city homicide po-lice-- Detective first class.
guess I am.
guys are down at the pit, waiting for your skinny white ass. Vámonos.
I knew you'd come for me, Stan.
I knew you would.
I'm gonna take care of you, buddy... Make sure you get what you need.
when can I come home?
I-I don't know. Soon.
I did it, Stan.
I got him good, right?
got him good. Like when we did that teacher, remember?
remember how we did that teacher?
look at me, Stan.
why are you looking at me like that, Stan? - I'm not looking at you.
Yeah, you are. Why are you looking at me like that?
quit looking at me like that, Stan.
quit looking at me li that.
Quit-- quit looking at me like that.
I did it for you, Stan.
I did it for you. I did it for Rosie.
quit looking at me like that.
it's not fair!
hello. - Is this Gil Sloane?
Yeah, speaking.
this is Jill Jennison for "Seattle Daily Record." Congrats on the arrest.
what arrest? - Darren Richmond.
my sources say you provided a photo, put him in the same car as Rosie Larsen's body.
we can talk off the record if you'd prefer.
so I told him what you said. He hung up on me.
so, what's the big secret?
you get an exclusive one day.
and you owe me your firstborn.
Yeah, if only. Thank you, Jill.
okay, chow time, let's eat.
go wash your hands, Tommy.
did you hear what I said?
I already washed my hands.
Okeydokey. Looks like somebody's hungry here.
it smells like cabbage.
Hey, be grateful your aunt Terry's cooking and not me.
get your elbows off the table.
Where's mom?
she's at your grandma's.
aunt Terry's gonna stay here a couple days while your ma gets some rest.
Denny, you like golumpki, don't you?
when's she coming home?
Hey, enough talking already. Sit down and eat.
he's lost a lot of blood and his condition is critical, but he survived the surgery.
Oh, thank God.
a bullet pierced his small bowel and transected his spinal cord.
he's lost all nerve function below the lower thoracic level.
what does that mean?
he's paralyzed from the waist down.
now, he's heavily sedated at the moment, so I don't expect he'll be awake for another few hours.
but it'd be nice when he wakes up that there's some family there for him.
Jamie. - Get out.
get out.
right through here.
Hey. You working the 11: 00-to-6: 00 shift?
what do you want, Ray?
me and the guys are ordering Chinese. You in?
that's all you guys eat is that Fu Manchu pupu platter MSG crap.
and your "double cheeseburgers, hold the meat" is organic?
at least it's got some vegetables in it.
ha ha ha. What?
it's got lettuce, tomatoes, pickles... - Pickles are not vegetables.
pickles are vegetables. What the hell you talking about
Aah! Gun!
he got my gun! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Belko! Put the gun down!
I want to go home!
don't shoot! Put the gun down!
put the gun down, Belko!
I want to go home!
put the gun down, Belko.
you said I could ko home.
you're gonna go home. You're gonna go home.
you lied!
put the gun down, Belko! Put the-- Belko! No, no, no, no, no!
there is no room for vigilantism in our justice system.
however, I believe that our sympathies should go out to the Larsen family for losing a daughter
Abani. You want to tell me why a report from the "Daily Record" has my name and number?
relax. Relax!
just relax. Calm down, okay?
just get her off my back!
what are you doing, bud?
someone was outside.
what?
I heard a noise by the front door.
I was scared.
Hey, you know... It's probably that cat from next door getting in our garbage again.
why don't you get back to bed?
I'll go down and take a look, okay?
get out of here.
what's Rosie's backpack doing here?
go upstairs, buddy. Go, go, go, come on. Go, go, go, go.
day FIFTEEN
what do you want?
we need to talk.
Gwen, please.
are you kidding me?
do you know where he is right now, Detective?
he's lying in the hospital paralyzed.
you're telling me your evidence doesn't add up?
I just need us to go over everything that you remember from that night.
no.
I spent the last 12 hours sitting in a hospital waiting room praying that he would survive, covered in his blood.
now you're telling me you don't have a case anymore?
if he wasn't with you that night, then where was he?
is that Rosie's camera, Mr. Larsen?
no. I-I don't know. Maybe it's from the school?
that's her backpack.
what about the rest of it?
Yeah. It's Rosie's stuff.
he's still out there, isn't he?
you got the wrong guy.
we got the right guy.
that's what you said about the teacher.
Hey, they're pressing charges today.
then what is my daughter's stuff doing here?!
in front of my house!
that-- That's blood, isn't it?
I understand you're upset, Mr. Larsen.
I'm just gonna get all this tested and get you some answers.
what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
I got two little boys upstairs.
whoever did this knows where we live.
am I just supposed to wait until he comes back?
Shh. Stan.
are you gonna give us protection?!
Mr. Larsen... - Hey, guys! Go brush your teeth.
and then I'll go take you to get doughnuts before school, okay?
I-I don't want them going to school-- Not till I know what the hell is going on.
don't come down, boys. I'll be right there.
all right, let me see what I can do about...
sending a car over and keep an eye on you. - Thank you.
and I'll give you a call as soon as we get some answers.
Hey, wait, wait, wait. What about Belko?
Yeah, you guys messed him up pretty good.
I saw that black eye yesterday.
did he get a doctor yet?
I-I'd never been to that b&b with him in Tacoma before.
I wasn't even supposed to go.
I had a dinner that night. It was canceled.
I thought I would join.
and sometime after midnight, he got up and left?
Yes.
did he say anything to you?
no. I was half asleep.
when he got back, he was soaking wet.
Yes.
did you ask him where he'd been?
no. He didn't tell me.
he just stood there in the middle of the room in his soaking-wet clothes, dripping on the rug.
and then he took off those clothes, and we... Somehow he was different.
different how?
more present.
less preoccupied.
for once I felt like I wasn't... competing with anyone else.
or maybe I was just imagining that.
what time was it when he got back, Gwen?
I don't know. - Think.
was it still dark outside?
I remember thinking it was morning.
Why? Because of the light?
no, because he smelled the way he smells after he's been kayaking in the morning.
he smelled like sweat?
more briny.
like the ocean.
Yes.
when I kissed him, I could taste the salt on his neck.
what did he do with his clothes from that night?
I don't know.
took them to the dry cleaner. I don't know.
do you have a key to his apartment?
Hey, Lieutenant.
Yeah. It's her backpack.
well, where'd it come from?
I don't know. That's a good question.
Larsen's kind of spooked. He thinks the killer's still out there.
Yeah, well, parents, they got theories, never gonna be satisfied.
Yeah, see, I-I-I told him we'd send a car by every now and then and check up on him.
Where's the bag?
I'm-- I'm taking it in in a few.
well, do it now.
and, uh, take it to Stu.
D-doesn't Linden always use Gary?
it's not Linden's case anymore. Just take it to Stu.
what was that about?
larsen case.
all of a sudden, Oakes interested in who I give the evidence to?
I need caffeine. You buying?
I got a choice?
no, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
no, no, no, Darren. Hey!
Hey, nurse? Nurse, he's-- he's pulling out his
he's trying to pull out his breathing thing.
Pulse-ox is okay. Let's put him on 8 liters of oxygen.
Mr. Richmond, can you hear me?
Yeah. Yeah.
we got him.
Hey. Doc. Dr. Madigan? - Yes?
so, h-he's awake?
Yep. Breathing on his own. That's a good sign.
great.
so, when are you gonna tell him?
tell him what?
that he can't w-walk.
how are you gonna tell him?
patients usually notice pretty quickly.
but you are the one that actually tells him, right?
Yes. Of course.
you should be there, too.
you are a close family member.
it's not an easy thing to process.
he's gonna need as much support as he can get.
Hey. Elyse, it's, uh, Jamie Wright. Again.
I left you two messages yesterday about ur brother.
look, the surgeon said-- He's gonna have a lot to deal with, Elyse.
so, just please call me.
or... just call me.
looking for Stu.
that the Larsen backpack?
Yeah, I need, uh, prints, blood types.
you know the drill.
okay, I'll let you know.
what's going on?
Belko... Last night, he... Belko killed himself.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I don't even un-- How did
this is so messed up, the cops--The cops don't know what the hell they're doing.
stop! You know what? You can't even go there right now, Stan.
you're out on bail.
you're facing prison time as it is.
you're all the boys have right now.
and you need to watch out for them.
what do I tell them about Belko?
nothing.
but what about Mitch?
we've got to tell them something, Stan.
she's their mom.
okay.
less we talk about this, the better.
what the hell am I supposed to do?
nothing is supposed to be like this.
no matter what they tell you, you just say you don't know what the condition is.
okay. Got it.
how long's he have to have that?
rest of his life... Probably.
have what?
you're awake.
are we up... Or down?
Darren, do you know where you are?
in a hospital?
Yeah.
Yeah, Darren, you had surgery.
you just-- You just need to rest.
Where's Gwen?
she was here last night.
she... had to go home.
why don't you get some sleep?
Jamie... My... My leg.
how's your pain?
here's... Here's some good news.
there's, um... There's a, um... This guy.
here, you just, um, you push it, and it will give you morphine.
how cool is that?
um... I'm gonna go get the doctor.
I'll be-- I'll be right back.
Hey. He's awake. Call the doctor.
Dr. Madigan's in surgery.
he'll be by later this afternoon.
but can't you call him or something? Let him know?
he's asking questions.
please, the doctor needs to talk to him right now.
I'll try to get a message to him, but I can't promise.
this here's a saltwater inlet.
everything else around here is freshwater.
how far is that inlet from here?
about half a mile.
are there kayak rentals down there?
no. Just a few houses.
locals working the traps.
thank you.
do you... honestly believe he did it? Killed that girl?
I don't know.
they came here a lot.
boy, he was head over heels for her.
the woman he was here with two weeks ago?
no. No, no, no. His wife. Lily.
Yeah, I been crabbing here the best part of 25 years.
every day?
well, that depends.
nights sometimes.
see, some folks say the best time to go crabbing is during a full moon.
some say low tide.
daytime, night-time.
me, I just say throw the damn ring in and see what comes up.
I bet you've seen a lot.
no, I'm not coming down there to fill out a report!
don't you people keep records?
detective Holder said he would send someone.
you like grilled cheese with tomatoes or ham?
plain. Just plain.
well, I have this very special fancy pan, if I can find it.
it makes the best grilled-cheese sandwiches ever.
what is all this stuff?
just crap from my apartment.
den? Denny, what are you looking at?
we should get a dog.
we can't get a dog. Mom's allergic.
detective Holder was here.
he saw what was on the doorstep.
I really need to speak with Detective Holder.
if you could try and reach him one more time...
whoa, there, partner. That's fragile.
I would-- Yeah, I'll hold. It's just a glass.
this-- The most expensive crystal that you can buy.
there's some people that have entire sets of these.
how much does it cost?
a lot.
mine was a gift.
we need a dog, dad.
dogs can protect you.
sir? Hear back from the lab on that backpack?
Yeah, uh, some latents, mostly Rosie's.
a few partials, no hits.
speedy G, that Stu, huh?
well, you'd be surprised what can get done when you have friends around here.
so, the victim's backpack turns up out of nowhere, and it's no big deal, huh?
I'm just saying we might want to look into it.
is that right?
well, when you're lieutenant, feel free to allocate your resources any way you like.
but you're not. I am.
and you're on the Bagby case with Dillman.
what? - All right.
I need DA Niilson.
when's she back?
no, no message. I've got her cell.
Christina, it's Linden.
I need to talk to you about Darren Richmond.
I've got something you're gonna want to hear.
call me right away.
I was sorry to hear about Richmond.
it's a nightmare.
you know, no matter what happens with this race, you put up a good fight.
I respect that.
get off! Get off me! Screw you, you little bitch!
you and that child killer deserve each other!
hold it.
I'm here with the permission of Senior Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Christina Niilson.
if you have a problem with that, call her.
Mr. Richmond.
get out.
I know where you were October 5th-- The night Rosie Larsen was killed.
Gwen... Told you I left that night.
why didn't you tell me?
help me to understand. - Why should I?
when I first met you, you were wearing a wedding band.
a lot of men don't. But you did.
five years after your wife's death.
you must have loved her very much.
october 5th.
you were standing on the bridge in Tacoma because it was your anniversary.
you had proposed to lily there.
the innkeeper remembers ordering champagne.
and maybe... standing on that bridge... again that night, it all came back to you...
what it had been... What you had... What you lost.
you have no idea... how I felt.
the fisherman... saw you in the water.
says that you fought him at first.
but I think you wanted to live.
and that's why you were soaking wet
I let her go. I stuck around for the applause.
and she died on the side of the road, alone, two minutes from our home.
I failed her.
I'm sorry for what happened to you.
I wish that I had known the truth.
do you have any idea... what a suicide attempt does to a political campaign?
if one word of this goes public because of you,
I will have my lawyers on your ass so fast, you won't know what hit you.
now get out.
next time you use my name to talk to a suspect, I need to know.
Richmond didn't do it.
I have a witness who was with him the night of the killing.
he was in Tacoma like he said.
what about the tollbooth photo?
the cameras weren't working on the bridge that night.
the photo was faked.
that's why I thought it might be best for us to talk in private.
if I had known you were coming as deep throat,
I would have worn my trench coat.
damn it, Linden.
you just opened up a Pandora's box of shit.
you do realize this?
you have to drop charges and reopen the Rosie Larsen case.
no problem.
good thing I'm not running for re-election.
the killer's still out there, Chris.
I can't just take your word.
not on this one. No way.
no, no. Talk to my witness.
corroborate Richmond's alibi yourself.
but I need you to keep him under wraps a couple of days.
the photo, too.
that's gonna really help my already-challenged relations with the chief.
look, I wouldn't ask you if I didn't have to.
the photo could be linked directly to Rosie Larsen's murder.
you got a few days.
Hey, I'm going out on a limb for you.
don't I even get a thanks?
nice. Right in the middle of the city hall gym.
we just about got this thing nailed, and now you and your little impulse-control
the little worm coldcocked me. I defended myself.
this is just the kind of press we don't need right now, you obsequious piece of shit!
I should fire your ass.
Yeah, well, you could... But I wouldn't recommend it.
put some ice on that thing.
hello. This is Jayne Daly calling from Channel 3 News.
we need someone to comment on Councilman Richmond's condition.
please call me as soon as possible here at the station.
I can be reached at 206-555-010
I'll take the sword. You take the scissors.
that's dumb.
that stupid sword's not gonna keep the bad guy out.
shut up! - You shut up.
dad's gonna be home soon, and I'm gonna tell him that you said he can't protect us.
the killer was right outside our house. He can't.
shut up. - It's true, and you know it.
No! It's mine!
just give me the sword. - No! It's mine!
no, it's not. - Yeah, it is! I made it!
can I help you, sir?
Yeah, you can help me. My name's Stan Larsen.
detective Holder promised to send a car by to watch my house, so where is it?
I don't know, sir.
if you want to talk to a detective, have a seat.
Hey. Hey, Holder! Holder, I'm talking to you!
call you back.
Mr. Larsen, I got to go.
you said you'd send a car by.
my kids are terrified.
what-- what the hell are you people doing about it?
we're working on it.
we're a little bit shorthanded right now.
if you see anything suspicious, give us a call.
the man who killed my daughter came to my house!
he put her bag-- Her bag with her blood on it
on my doorstep, and you want me to call if I see anything suspicious?!
Mr. Larsen, I'm sorry.
you son of a bitch.
so, what's the emergency you couldn't tell me over the phone?
I-it's the Larsen case.
the bag that dropped.
remember Oakes was riding me on that?
so I swapped the bags, and I gave him my bag.
what?
and then he lied about the test results.
why would he do that... Unless we got the wrong guy?
we didn't get the wrong guy.
Richmond is the doer. He was on that bridge.
it's over. Move on.
Oh, uh... We got to tell IA about Oakes.
no, we don't.
in fact, what you should do, Holder, is shut the hell up.
what?
you think you got this job because you're a good cop?
no, son. It's 'cause you're dirty. And everybody knows it.
Clankhead.
low-life tweaker.
you think anybody's gonna believe you?
why do you think you still have a paycheck every week?
because of me.
don't you ever forget that.
the photo. You gave it to me.
that's right. Then you took it.
you knew you were taking a shortcut, but you didn't care, cause you wanted the badge more.
that photo was requisitioned with your partner's badge number, in case you forgot.
so if you start getting a hair up your ass, just remember it's on her... Not me.
get the hell out of my car.
in a surprising turn of events,
deputy Prosecuting Attorney Christina Niilson announced today that Councilman Darren Richmond will not be charged in the murder of Seattle teen Rosie Larsen.
there was no comment from police or response from Richmond, who is recovering from a near-fatal gunshot wound.
who are you? Where's Oakes?
I'm his replacement-- Lieutenant Carlson.
except that we both know that Richmond wasn't arrested because of sloppy police work.
now I have work to do, Detective if you don't mind.
I know about the photo. - The photo?
Yeah. That the photo was a fake?
Seattle times would love to have that on the front page.
why are you still here, Detective Linden?
I thought you retired.
but I want back on the case.
I'm not going out like this. I'm gonna solve this murder.
while I appreciate your commitment,
I haven't been so impressed with your ability so far.
however, DA Niilson strongly encouraged me to give you another chance.
so, you're in luck.
one more thing.
I work my case alone.
I don't need a partner on this.
you're in no position to make any demands.
holder's on with you until I say otherwise.
I think you're gonna find things will be quite different around here from now on.
Darren, I... - Dr. Madigan already told me.
damnedest thing.
um... They dropped the charges against you about an hour ago.
my lucky day.
your dad's gonna love these.
damn. I left my cigs in the car.
I'll get 'em. No, I'll get 'em.
you're Tommy, right?
Eugene Braxton, Seattle times!
you get the hell off my property, you blood-sucking son of a bitch!
okay, all right! Just back off!
just trying to do my job.
you leave us the hell alone!
Oh, hey, Mr. Larsen.
how does it feel that the police dropped the charges against Richmond?
guess all bets are off, huh?
look, you think about it. You want to talk, give me a call.
your kid's got my card.
get upstairs.
I thought we weren't gonna be staying here long.
we're not, but we can't leave our stuff in the car.
it'll get stolen.
could you put those on the bed?
how was school?
fine. Weird.
just give it time. It'll work out.
open the door, Linden. I-I know you're in there.
I need to talk to you.
Linden, open the door! I know-- I know you're in there!
I-I saw your car parked out-- Linden, open the door!
Linden, I Open the door, Linden! I-I got-- I got to talk to you.
I-I can explain... Linden, just open this-- Open the door, Linden!
earlier today, Assistant DA Christina Niilson issued this statement.
he's no longer a suspect in the case of the murder of Rosie Larsen.
the charges have been dropped, but we're still investigating the case.
and that's all I can say for now.
Rosie's killer... came to my house.
he's still out there.
Janek, I want you to find him... and kill him.
the waterfront was out platform.
we can talk this through! We can get... - Okay...We are over.
this is where it all started, Holder...
it's a keycard, from city hall.
Ted Wright. He used to say ...
that bad luck either destroys you or makes you the man you really are.
whoever was in that room the night Rosie died...works here.
on the eve of the mayoral election
councilman darren richmond made a stunning speech tonight.
he admitted to attempting suicide.
the incident occurred on the night of the rosie larsen murder.
Mr. Richmond... - Which one is it...
Donnie or marie?
the only ones in richmond's campaign with enough power to broker a deal between the indians and ames.
gotta bounce, linden.
with polls opening in a few short hours, more will be revealed.
all right. Hold up.
come with me.
Linden... - I have an idea.
come on.
the hallway!
listen to me!
hurry up! All right, let's go!
I've spoken before about a man named ted wright, a man who...
dumb prick should've fallen on his sword when I gave him the chance.
in 21 hours, the election will be over. We'll stick it in ourselves.
I thought you took care of this.
can I help you?
I know about the photo, mayor - The one you planted.
where do you think you're going?
you need to leave right now before I call security - I have a copy of it.
I'm going to "the times" with it. - She's lying.
or we can make a deal. We have a common enemy.
show's over. Come on. Let's go.
if you want to win this election, call off your dogs.
what are you waiting for? Get them out of here.
there's nine hours till the polls open, chief. -We're running out of time, mayor.
we know the richmond campaign screwed you first, planting the indian bones.
it was a smart move.
without the waterfront, the election was over for you, so you retaliated with a photo.
Richmond wasn't going to prison. It would never have gone that far.
you just needed richmond out of the running till the eles ove.
everything that went down after that was just collateral damage, right?
don't lay your guilt on me, detective.
you doctored the photo to win the election, not to cover up rosie's murder.
we know you weren't involved in her death.
but the richmond camp was.
this is what's going to happen.
you're going to call off my arrest.
then you're gonna get them and him and carlson off our backs until we solve rosie larsen's murder.
in exchange, we pursue our lead.
and the photo? - We drop it.
do we have a deal, mr. Mayor?
Thanks.
did you guys get a dog?
the boys needed something good in their life.
Stan, I'm so sorry.
it doesn't matter.
you're home.
that's all that matters now.
don't eat that thing. There's probably six razor blades in it.
mom!
Ohh, sweetheart.
Oh, my god. I missed you.
Oh, my baby.
I've missed you so much.
we got a dog. - I can see that.
Tommy, come here, baby.
he'll be okay. He's having a hard time.
let me go talk to him. - Okay.
I'm glad that you're back. We missed you.
I can't let you go. Let me look at you.
I knew you'd come back.
chief jackson said the casino security tapes will be ready in the morning, but you got to get them yourself.
they're abiding by the search warrant. - Yeah, yeah, whatever.
feds say the surveillance disks but we got to get our own asses to the casino to pick them up.
Yeah, I'm sure nicole complied fully with the warrant. - Yeah.
What'd carlson say?
you're still on suspension till your hearing.
that rent-a-cop can play at being the boss as long as he leaves us the hell alone.
if gwen wasn't richmond's alibi, then he wasn't hers either.
Yeah, she could've made her way from tacoma to the casino just like we thought richmond did.
kill rosie, be back in time for richmond's reappearance.
you think blondie ran through the woods, for real?
hunted rosie, beat her unconsc it doesn't track.
except for the part about the trunk.
it was
it's a really passive way to kill.
you don't have to look the person in the face while they die.
men kill with guns and knives, n poison their victims. General rule.
earlier that night...
Gwen had a dinner with a city council member named ruth yitanes at the lake union yacht club.
Gwen said that yitanes canceled the dinner.
it doesn't say why. What about jamie?
Iboks like he worked late, went home to his grandfather. The guy alibi'd him.
he lives with his grandpops? Damn.
you want to have a talk with grandpa?
I'll go to the campaign, yo, linden for Night of death jamie went to the city hall gym at 4: 37 a. m.
so? - Security guard who let him in said he didn't have his key card.
it may take more than a haircut to win you this, darren.
I'm counting on you, charles. You've always been my lucky charm.
what? - We're taking a beating, aren't we?
preliminary polls aren't great.
I told them the truth.
I'm glad I did it.
I'll tell you what... I never heard a politician...
Hello? ... - Make a speech like that.
nothing to be ashamed about.
I just hope folks remember that today.
,too, charles. I do, too.
have you talked to the grandfather yet?
Yeah, jamie's grandpa said he was there all night.
I mean, he seemed on the up-and-up, but who knows?
and I called yie-taines or whatever the hell her name is about gwen eaton's story and nothing yet.
give me an hour, and then we got to get those disks from the casino.
all right. You find out who's in charge of the key cards in the campaign yet?
Yep, I'm talking to him now. Got to go.
Mr. Kinberg? Detective linden, seattle p. d.
is this from your office?
H. That's the prefix of our cards.
who does that card belong to? - I don't have a list. Sorry.
it got deleted from my hard drive.
I must have left my computer while I was still logged on, and somebody...
when did you notice it had been deleted?
monday, october 8th.
that's the monday after the rosie larsen murder. You didn't think to bring this up?
what aut a replacement card?
did anybody come to you for a new card after that weekend?
Yeah, but... - Who was it?
- re Seattle p. d. We're here for the disks.
leme see that. - Yeah? Perfect.
security's the door on the right.
Oh, I guess they're out to lunch. - Too bad
holder, check this out.
girlfriend likes the limlight.
speaking of which - what the ed to her hand? - Trouble in paradise?
maybe bobby isn't just her pit bull. - Did you just figure that out?
I'll take it from here.
no late fees on those dvds, right?
we have fully complied with the federal warrant.
nothing to hide.
right, nothing but the footage on the broken camera.
how's your head, detective? Feeling better? - Much.
what happened to your girlfriend's hand?
you know your way out.
Hey, next time, we should do this at our place.
food's gonna be crap, but the beds are free.
is that gwen eaton?
looks pretty cozy with the wapis.
that's her pops, too.
well, that explains how a blue blood like gwen gets involved with these lowlifes.
what's her connection to ames?
Gwen the balls on that one Like I was the one who called the meeting.
you know, they're the ones who need my support with the unions.
councilwoman yitanes, did gwen say why she canceled dinner?
Nope, she just left a message, said something had come up with the campaign.
U know, I'm not a detective, detectives.
but jamie wright has been loyal to darren for the last 10 years.
don't you think it's kind of strange that after only a couple of months, gwen is his closest adviser?
meaning what? - Meaning that she uses her va-jay-jay to condate.
that's her m. o.
she pretends to be in love with them Whatever it takes to benefit her.
just like her daddy.
apple doesn't fall very far from the tree.
ms. Yitanes, does the richmond campaign have any relationship with michael ames or his company, - columbia domain fund? - Cdf is a major supporter of the mayor.
and trust me, sally is the one in the ames family that wears the pants, not michael.
cdf is her company. Michael's her de facto errand boy.
so waterfront project going down screws her, not him.
and here I thought you were just a slice of brainless beefcake.
so, tell me, does this security breach have anything to do with the ameses, too, huh?
thank you for your time, councilwoman. - Oh, I see.
that's how we're gonna play it. Ok, fine.
Where'd you get the info on ames' company? - City planning department.
who'd you vote for, councilman?
Oh, I was supposed to vote? I thought that was the men's room.
the latest exit polls aren't in your favor, but it seems a lot of voters are responding positively to your speech.
your thoughts, mr. Richmond.
I've run an honest race.
I've surrounded myself with the best people I know, people I could literally trust with my life.
Darren. What are you doing here?
ball court's down the street, isn't it?
why, you want to play a game of horse?
how about a photo, huh? Come on.
that speech was the last of your career.
it's one I'm proud of, lesley.
ave one like that?
okay. Got your money shot. We'll see you at the next stop.
I called the car. We'll be around back. - Okay.
good luck, councilman.
you look like you could use a break. I know a secret exit.
ge other day, councilman. - Thank you.
how long till the car gets here? - About a minute and a half.
what is it, gwen?
that night.
if I had known why you left or what you were going through.
this should be your day... Not his.
it's not right.
it's out of our hands.
I tried so hard for you.
we came so far, darren.
I'll see you at the next stop.
it has the biggest eyes of any animal in the entire world.
out.
as big as basketballs.
I got four stars. - Four stars?!
Hey, guys.
will you make me a grilled cheese?
Oh, I'll make it. I'll make it for you.
um, is it okay if aunt te I like the way she cuts off the crusts.
Yes, of course. Absolutely.
why don't you, mr. Four stars, sorry.
we've been eating a lot of grilled cheese around here lately.
they'll be glad to get back to your cooking, believe me.
you know, I found a new place to live not too far from here.
this yours? - Oh, yeah.
I just put some of my stuff in with the rest of the laundry.
so I guess you guys are gonna be busy moving soon, so I figured I better get my ass in gear.
moving?
the new house.
I thought that since you were back, I figured...
what new house? What are you talking about?
I'm sorry. I thought that you knew.
I- I found out by accident.
you should just talk to stan about it.
Yeah, I will. I'll do that.
don't be mad at him, okay? ...
we all did the best thad we could, you know, while you were gone.
it was hard.
Stan, the boys, they needed...
they needed what?
you have no right.
I'm not judging you. - Yes, you are.
no, I'm not. - Yes, you are, terry.
you don't know what it's like. You don't have a family. You don't have children.
you don't know what it feels like.
what do you know about fbl
I know is that I've been working my ass off trying to keep your family together while you were trying tb find yourself on some vision quest.
d so much, mitch.
and you walked out.
you walked out.
these are all michael ames' companies?
all five of them. All eligible to bid on city contracts.
ray says he got nicole and roberta on tape on the casino floor at 1: 20 a. m.
so, they couldn't have been part of the attack on rosie on the 10th floor.
Ames was on the ferry. Indians were on the floor.
so, the attacker must have been - Donnie or marie.
check this out.
one of ames' companies doesn't got his wife's name on the board.
just his.
ncp - nereus capital properties.
so he tanks the waterfront 'cause he's paving the way for his own company to make a separate deal.
Double-crosses the mayor, screws his wife to boot.
Ames really was planning on le for terry.
excuse me.
nereus capital properties was formed a month ago.
you made it eligib on city cont.
that seems pretty fast. Is that standard?
I- it's not illegal.
you expedited the process, though.
want to explain why?
I got an e-mail. There was an interested party at city hall.
a councilman. - Darren richmond?
Richmond sent you an e-mail?
it came from his aide. - Was it gwen eaton?
no.
jamie wright.
we're gonna keep this.
have been pulled down or defaced in the last two hours.
you can't tell me the mayor's people aren't behind that.
Yes. Yes.
thank you, nancy. That would be lovely. Thank you for doing your job.
rule number one in politics -
never run against a guy with no scruples.
you know anything about a company called ncp?
uh, construction, right?
all those 3-letter companies sound the same.
Yeah, your little lady down at the city planning department - She gave us this.
your personal request to expedite ncp through the system.
you remember now?
Yeah. I sent that.
so what? It's routine. - Is it?
look, it the highest standards of political ethics, but it's not illegal.
we do favors for friends all the time.
well, what about enemies?
ncp's owned by michael ames. he's playing on adam's side, not yours.
why you supporting your enemy's bf, huh?
you screwing the boss man un spit it out. We won't tell. Promise.
I'm trying to give my boss man a potential ally.
wooing away the competition's major donors happens to be part of my job description.
F. y. i.
that's fine.
Richmond know what you were up to?
you tell your lieutenant every time you have a hunch that could lead to nowhere?
does he even know you're here right now?
was gwen eaton part of wooing ames, too?
okay, look. I know you got to do your job, but I'm not about to dish dirt on a colleague for you.
ask her yourselves.
Oh, one more thing.
city hall key card on you, bro?
what?
your city hall key card. Do you have it?
now, if that's it, bro, I've got a campaign to resuscitate.
it's time for you to buy your own pack.
what if gwen and jamie did it together?
even if she was the one in the room that night, lost the key card, they both could have been part of the plan.
explains the different methods of taking rosie out.
male and female co-killers.
I mean, we know ames got a call about the waterfront break-in that night.
that's why he nixed his trip to vegas.
maybe that's why gwen canceled dinner with councilwoman yitanes. ...
further comment.
in other news, reputed polish mob boss janek kovarsky was gunned down in the capitol habl section of the city last night.
sources say he was shot in the head at close range.
homicide investigators have or leads to date.
and if the exit polls are any indication, councilman darren richmond is not out of the race for mayor just yet.
what? What is it?
it's nothing.
Stan, terry told me about the house.
that's where all the money went, right?
I should have trusted you, stan.
I should have told you.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
God, it seems like a lifetime ago, back when there were good surprises.
so, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna - Are you gonna sell it?
maybe we don't have to.
could be a fresh start, mitch... For all of us.
Stan, I-I came back because...
I wanted - I wanted to be here, you know?
with you... And with our boys.
there's a yard.
and there's so much light, mitch.
and the boys - the boys, they can each have their own room.
I don't want to leave this. I don't want to leave her behind.
you know, there's no moving on...
as long as we're here... In this house.
is that what we're supposed to do, stan? We're just supposed to move on and then -
and we just forget everything?
Yeah, I think we should move on.
you don't have a right to look at me like that after what I've been through these past few weeks.
that's not fair.
Fair?! What's fair got to do with it?
you're the one who left.
the boys - the boys - They needed you.
I needed you.
and you walked out.
I was the one who stayed.
because you could.
I'm her mother.
I'm her dad! What are you talking about?!
let me tell you something.
you can take as much time as you want to try to figure it all out but you cannot come back here and say that you loved rosie more than I did.
yo, biff. How's it hanging?
just gonna be a few. - Seattle police department.
Hey, if my car don't meet the club's standards, you can just swap it out with that jag, all right?
yo, why you taking down my tags?
uh, club policy, sir. sign here.
do you make all the guests sign in? - Yeah.
is the sign-in sheet for friday, october 5th, still there?
Yeah, but I can't just give it to you.
yo, ease up, son.
minimum wage ain't worth fighting the po-po.
did you work that night, gibby?
uh, yeah. Yeah, I work the weekends, 'cause the club members get wasted, and the tips are pretty awesome.
is that right? - Yeah.
do you remember seeing her here that night?
uh, I - A lot of people come through here on the weekend. I - sorry.
we're gonna hang on to that for a second.
here it is. Gwen eaton, 8:37 p. m. , october 5th.
check out the license plate.
that's the campaign car rosie's body was found in.
we've almost closed the gap?
Really? Okay. I have to tell him. I'll call you back.
ms. Eaton? You have a minute?
not really.
we're tracking a security breach at city hall.
you aware of any staff who lost their key cards?
Yes, I did. A few weeks ago, it went missing from my purse.
you got a replacement card? - yes.
just after the larsen murder.
look, I was in tacoma all night. I already told you that.
you also told us the councilman went missing for several hours.
can you account for that missing time on your end?
one in a hotel room asleep.
what about earlier that night before you went to tacoma?
you had an appointment with councilwoman yitanes.
I told the police that wes ago.
except yitanes said that you canceled on her.
Yes, I had a personal reason that wasn't relevant.
I wanted to see darren that night, okay?
I knew something was wrong.
now I know what it was. We all do.
what car were you driving that night?
mine. - ain.
you took the campaign car to the yacht club.
Yes. I mean, earlier I drove the campaign car.
then I dropped it off after the club, after I canceled dinner. Then I took my car to tacoma.
why didn't you tell us you were driving the car rosie larsen's body was found in?
you people nearly destroyed a man's life with your false accusations, so I would be very careful about what I say right now if I were you.
we're just asking questions. You're the one who keeps lying.
how about we continue this down at the station, ms. Eaton?
not unless you're arresting me.
and if you continue to harass me or anyone else involved in this campaign, at the christmas parade.
do I make myself clear?
it's not real reindeers in that parade.
it's huskies with antlers strapped on them.
ready for bed, boys?
I am.
I always get cold, mom.
that's 'cause you kick off your covers.
you always did, little denners.
even when you were a baby.
I'd come in to check in on you, and your little feet would just be so cold.
you okay, mom?
Yeah, honey, I'm good.
you can make us grilled cheese tomorrow, mom.
thank you, baby.
sweet dreams.
it's all gonna be okay, sweetie.
sleep tight.
we're not out of the race yet.
Yes!
that's huge. It's less than 2 points.
we're still in the running, jamie.
more than that. We could still win this damn thing.
you have stood beside me this whole time. Not even my family did that.
not that that's saying much.
and it's that time. - Oh, come on.
I thought you were done with that superstitious crap.
I think of it more as tradition.
and what am I supposed to tell people -
their fearless leader is too much of a pussy to watch his own returns?
Hello?
this is darren.
who is this?
we're never gonna get that damn disk from the indians.
Ames lawyered up, donnie and marie are done talking.
there's always a way in.
everybody makes mistakes. Most people make the same ones over and over again.
you never told me he was your shrink.
your point? - Nothing. I'm just saying.
you think i'm gonna go nuts again?
Nah, linden. I got your back's all I'm saying.
think of me as your sensel in the blood sport of life.
Hey, check this out.
that woman standing next to chief jackson - Something's wrong with her arm.
it's in a cast.
Yeah, it's broken. Just like roberta's hand.
so, what is it? Was there a problem with the disks?
no.
we just wanted to talk to you about your girlfriend, chief jackson?
I thought you might want to do that in private.
do you recognize her?
name's kallie wimms.
Nicole's head of security before you.
Yeah, I heard of her. So what?
you heard she's kicking it these days up at the bainbridge corrections facility for women?
you want to guess why, bobby?
I got no time for this. - why, is nicole gonna be back soon?
wouldn't want her to catch you with us, would you?
hand looks pretty bad. Why'd she do it this time?
maybe because of that key card?
Yeah. Real funny how that went down.
eight years ago, your girlfriend got full immunity in exchange for her testimony.
she pinned it all on kallie.
court transcript. Read it yourself.
Yeah, that's right.
now kallie's doing 10 to 20...
on a murder-2 charge she claims she never committed.
maybe kallie's a lying bitch.
Nicole sold out kallie when she needed to, and she's gonna do the same thing to you.
but you don't need us to tell you that, do you?
you know she's gonna screw you over. You just haven't figured out how.
this is all bull.
she doesn't trust you anymore.
you kept that disk, didn't you?
so you'd have something to hold over her, something to prove she was involved in rosie larsen's murder. Just in case.
you don't have anything on us.
you broke into my motel room, you put that drawing up.
my son's gone because of you, you piece of shit.
I never broke into your place. - Sot's just a matter of time re I find something on you!
I don't know what you're talking about.
there ain't no "us..." When it comes to chief jackson.
and you know that.
she's gonna hang you out to dry just like she did kallie unless you make the first move.
Nicole was on the 10th floor that night.
you weren't, but that disk is the only thing that proves it.
give us the disk.
I'll be a while, jerry.
maybe you want to take a break?
I'll call you when I'm ready to leave.
here it is. It's the campaign car.
heading into the casino parking lot, 12: 58 a. m.
can't see the driver.
that's definitely the campaign car rosie was found in.
put in the other disk.
1: 02 a. m.
I'm glad you came. You're a smart man.
get to the point.
if you are who you say you are, prove it.
what's your hurry?
you need to go somewhere and make another speech about me?
that's one...
fast-forward the tape.
stop.
that's two.
just one more to go.
what did you do?
what the hell was so important you had to talk to me tonight?
why did you lie to me, jamie?
on the season finale of AMC's The Killing
Rosie Larsen's killer will be revealed.
I'm not that girl who got herself killed!
you owe me. Shut up.
3: 37 AM, the night of the killing.
it doesn't prove collusion.
it's over.
where is Jamie Wright?
I don't know. I saw him at the office before I got here.
why did you lie?
where were you the night the Larsen girl died, Jamie?
for a longer look at the next episode of AMC's The Killing
what these kids go through on a day to day basis is bad enough without this - this madman out there.
and what are they calling him? The Pied Piper?
it's ridiculous. Angie Gower came here once.
are you sure she didn't come back again?
well, you're welcome to search the place.
check our logs. She's not here.
it's mostly girls, Pastor. Not a lot of boys up there. Why is that?
girls like getting their picture taken.
they're just kids in so many ways. Yeah.
they're more vulnerable than the boys. But that's probably obvious.
do you have any photos of the girls who passed through here 3, 31/2 years ago?
uh, I might. I can look.
you know, any way I can help, I want to, of course.
what's the attraction?
excuse me?
to working with kids, I mean.
nobody misses them...
or goes looking for them.
they're the throwaways of the world.
that's what the killer's thinking, too
easy prey, fallen angels, looking to be saved.
I don't think that man out there is looking to save anyone.
if you have those photos...
I'm sorry I can't offer more help about Angie.
you know, this house is a sanctuary for kids like her.
if she does come by, I'll let you know.
I'm sure we'll be in touch.
baby.
where you been?
out. We were just, um
whatever. I mean, uh, I don't want to know.
twitch, come on, please. Don't make such a big deal out of it.
huh? You need a piece, fine.
you think I don't got ass all over the city?
I just got done scamming some rich bitch.
I'm talking old, like 40.
giving it to her all day in her fancy condo, getting fed steak and wine, said she would take me shopping and get whatever I want.
Yeah, whatever. You just been on your knees like everybody else.
Nah, you're the queer. Eat me.
hell, no. I got standards.
why are you always such a jerk?!
Hey, hey. I hate you!
get off me, you bitch! And this is my place! I hate you!
and I don't want to live with you! Okay.
come on, Lyric. Let's go. Ugly-ass bitches, you get out of here!
there's nothing on ViCAP or CODIS for Pastor Mike Sheehan.
he's never even gotten a parking ticket.
just 'cause he didn't get caught doesn't mean he ain't a pervert.
everyone's out looking for Angie
must be why this place is tomb.
80% of our dead girls passed through Beacon Home.
he's looking at these girls, day in, day out.
it's just too much for him.
so he creates this world around his hunger. Beacon Home's a perfect setup.
he gets to look at his victims all day.
it's lot of work for access to kids that aren't hard to get access to.
it's not about access.
it's about him trying to save them.
man of God?
it's a coward's refuge. Opiate of the masses.
I thought you liked opiate of the masses.
not everyone needs that N. A./A. A. blah, blah.
you know I been clean for almost two years now?
good for you. That's great.
not everyone finds their salvation in some stank-ass basement with a bunch of old booze hounds.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
you should, too.
see you in few hours.
what are you doing here? I was waiting for you.
how else was I supposed to see you?
you don't answer your calls. I want to talk, Sarah.
I'm really sorry, but I can't get into it right now, okay?
let's talk tomorrow.
you haven't been home in three nights. Where have you been?
have you been sitting outside my house?
why does everything get to be on your terms? Huh?
you just decide something out of the blue, and that's it?
all right, you need to go home.
is this how you were in that other life of yours?
is this the way you treated people?
it's no wonder you don't have anyone in your life.
you need to understand something, because it's the best answer you're going to get.
I was pretending to be something that I wasn't with you.
and now it's over.
let go of me, because you really don't want me to tell you a third time how things are.
damn, those pearly whites I just seen?
didn't even know you had teeth. I thought fangs, maybe.
ha, ha, ha. You funny, Bugs. Where's your Kmart suit?
being pressed by Versace since he fabricated it.
something just stunk up the air. Do you smell it?
it smells like pork. That ain't a smell, wee one.
that's salary and purpose.
watch yourself.
come on, let's get out of here.
Oh, these pigs! How do you do?
fine.
come on.
let's go. He's - he's a cop.
that's just bugs. Got him under my thumb.
hurry up.
Ooh, "Hurry up.
bullet's got herself a little love bunny.
what's her name? Delilah? Jezebel?
Oh, shut up, asswipe.
lyric It's Lyric. Lyric.
what are you doing trolling my crib this time of night for, anyway?
the guy who runs the Beacon Home, Pastor Mike
what's up with him?
man, don't even. It's not him.
not him, what? What do you mean, what? He's not the killer.
he's like the only guy in Seattle who's not a pedophile.
man, you pulled off some wizardry.
your little mama's full-on magnetized to your skinny ass.
you know, I had me a whole stable when I was a young one.
so if you need any tips or tricks... ...I'm your man.
you're saying you leave your lady fulfilled at the end of the night?
believe that.
you sure I shouldn't be teaching you how to holla at the shorties, punk?
whatever.
I mean, you can be as smooth as Velveeta, but at the end of the day, you got to take care of your girl.
protect her, you know? Keep her safe.
this ain't no kind of crib.
you be safe, Bullet.
like the music?
you know what that is, Ray? You still got a job?
why wouldn't I? You let the kid die on your shift.
wasn't my fault.
how many times you got to tell yourself that before you believe it?
just the once.
running out on your shift.
I'd have to guess family.
wife and kid doing okay, Frankie?
everybody healthy?
yeah? Problems with the old lady?
Really? The wife?
she stepping out on you?
that's hard, buddy.
um, so, when you left your shift and you left the kid to die, had you just heard about it, or did you walk in on your wife banging some other guy?
you sure you want to die like this, Ray...
dangling from a rope?
Oh, you don't know what that sound is?
they're building a gallows just for you, buddy.
you know that if the weight's off, Ray, the length of the rope is off even an inch, it makes the difference between strangling to death slowly and snapping your neck quick.
either way, you shit yourself.
got to die wearing a diaper, Ray.
ain't that hell of a way to check out?
it's still up to you, you know, in how you go out.
you decide how to exit this world.
look, my daughter is in there!
I came in here calm.
I came in here calm, and that didn't work, and you're, like - Excuse me. Excuse me.
my daughter is in there. I found these in her things.
look, I'm sorry, you cannot be in - Look, bed lottery tickets.
you can't - listen, you cannot - This is - Kallie! Do not - Get off of me!
get off of me. You cannot be in here. Listen.
Kallie! Kallie! I- I know Kallie, okay?
she is not here, I promise you.
would you mind?
just have a seat.
look, I'm sorry, I - It's just she's missing, and I'm trying to find her, and I'm trying to figure out who she was.
I didn't even know she read, let alone science fiction.
but w-why would she have to stay here?
couldn't she go someplace else?
uh, well, uh, these kids don't have a lot of options.
uh, they sleep under bridges, in abandoned buildings, and some of them walk the streets all night.
kallie took classes here, too, sometimes.
cosmetology was her favorite.
yeah?
and hairstyling.
I do hair. I have this chair at our house, and she used to play around on it when she was little.
Yeah, well, I guess that's why.
she's still out there.
yeah? God tell you that?
kallie is a tough girl.
a survivor.
Yeah. She is.
everyone knows. Is that it?
that kid died.
we should have had eyes on him. You should have.
you got no idea what I was dealing with.
whatever.
my son called me, said his mother was missing, and she'd been gone for hours.
she was at a bar with some guy
not the first time.
and my boy's looking at me like I'm some chump.
everybody knows.
everybody knows, even the damn cons.
I got to get to post.
we scoured every scabies-ridden motel,
s. R.O., and warehouse in the city.
no luck finding Joe Mills or nine-fingered Angie.
if they're holed up somewhere, they got to come up for air, cash.
get eyes on all these cab routes Mills drove and shake down the teen shelters again.
just do it again - that's all we can do.
Hey. Hi, um, I found this outside that place the kids stay at, the, um, Beacon Home.
where, exactly?
uh, I found it on my car, what, right after I talked to the priest.
pastor Mike? Yeah.
you think it's got something to do with Kallie, like maybe he's lying and he knows where she's at?
did you see anyone in the vicinity of your car, or maybe somebody watching you in the home or on the street?
it's okay. This is gonna help us.
you'll let me know, right, like, if you find something out, like, right away?
Yeah, I will. I promise.
okay, thank you. Yeah.
whoever left that note wants to be found.
true, but they're not gonna get caught out in the open talking to us about her, not about their beloved pastor.
you hungry? No, we're not here to eat.
suit yourself. I'm hungry. How can I help you?
uh, give me a Hawaii with no ham, extra pineapple - cold pineapple.
don't be stingy on it, man. - Okay.
I remember you.
you were looking for Bullet. Did you ever find her?
I saw Bullet last night.
guess she and Lyric hooked up, huh?
Yeah, the Lyric drama.
were you at Beacon Home today?
you left this note?
we want to help. It sounds like you do, too.
what's Pastor Mike lying about?
I had bed at Beacon.
I went out on the roof to smoke.
it was like 4: 00 A. M. And I seen her in the alley
that girl that got away from that killer, lying there like she was dead.
but she was just out of it, all cut up and bleeding.
I called him, told him.
said he was nearby, in his car.
he was in his car at 4: 00 in the morning?
he got there right away.
and as soon as he pulled up, that girl
she started screaming and ran off.
what did Pastor Mike do then?
he got back in his car and chased after her.
he came back to Beacon an hour later.
he was alone, and...
...he...
he had blood all over his shirt.
I got to go.
I'm gonna have this view from my house one day, with all glass ceilings so you can see the sky.
pastor Mike told me about these apartments the government runs.
just give them 200 bucks, and they help you with the rent.
you just got to fill out the paperwork and get a job and stuff.
what are you thinking?
that you're beautiful.
I've been totally in love with you.
Really?
it's gonna come down tonight, the rain.
we can't walk the night out again.
come on.
I'll find us a place.
Yeah, I know.
I have faith.
according to our witness, he had contact with Angie Gower.
the pastor? Yeah.
why isn't he just the guy that took her to the vet?
then what's he lying about it for? 'Cause he's definitely running us around.
look, he attacks her in the park, she gets away, he catches up with her, tries to finish the job.
he was already in his car at 4: 00 in the morning and just minutes away from her.
we have to at least vet him.
he had contact with a lot of our dead girls.
all right. Let's get a full background
DMV records, birth certificate, credit history. But be discreet.
and a search warrant for his car?
we don't have enough yet. He attacks them in the car.
that's gonna be our best chance for evidence.
I'm not gonna smear a minister's name over some street kid's say-so.
so work it if you want that search warrant.
and get eyes on his car.
I don't want it disappearing in thin air like Joe Mills.
and what the hell are you wearing, Holder?
come on, just for one night. We'll sleep on the floor.
it's for Lyric, not me. Okay, you know how the lottery works.
we're full up for the next two nights.
how about those government apartments you told me about?
you think we can get one of those?
maybe, but it takes time... and a deposit.
and it's Sunday, and the offices are closed.
but if you're serious, then - Look, look, look.
it's her psycho stepdad, okay?
he figured out where she is, and he's like, crazy, full on, screaming he's got a gun.
let me think of something.
give me some skin, P. M. you the man.
I told them cops to lay off.
I mean, they're totally on the wrong track.
what do you mean?
I mean, they think that girl came here, and she didn't.
right?
Yeah. That's right.
cool.
I got to jam.
get on.
you got to be weighed.
we need it to measure the counterweight.
counterweight - that's a nice word.
looking forward to it, Evan? I'm not on the execution team.
why not? Hmm?
don't like a good show?
I don't have time for this.
get on the scale.
get on.
just give me a second.
look, they get your weight right, your neck will break like it's supposed to.
you won't feel any pain.
Seward, look at me.
get on, or I will put you on.
Yeah, we've got eyes on him. We'll let you know if he moves.
if you light it, it's gonna start raining again.
it's true.
Jack still knows I smoke.
Yeah, well, you ain't exactly Houdini with them smokes, Linden.
he wants me to move to Chicago.
Chicago P. D.'s a storied institution.
it's good police.
cold as hell.
what's holding you back? It ain't that boyfriend of yours.
I'm just a hire-back.
temporary police.
you dodged that.
so what's going on with Mr. Boatman Cody?
what? He hurt your feelings? I'll beat his ass. Just say the word.
no, he got, uh, too attached, I guess.
I didn't mean for that to happen, but I don't know.
he's just a kid.
don't even go there.
I guess I wanted to be that person, you know, like, living on an island, working 9: 00 to 5: 00, not smoking.
but I...
sometimes what you get isn't really what you want.
where are those smokes?
detective Holder.
what?
Thanks.
report came back on the pastor.
Mike Sheehan died four years ago.
he's using a fake I. D.
you know what Gary Gilmore's last meal was, Ray?
steak and potatoes.
limit's 15 bucks nowadays, so you'll probably get Salisbury steak.
come on, boss. You got to pick one.
how long has it been since your last dessert?
I want my lawyer. Get him on the phone right now.
what, you change your mind? You want the needle now, Ray?
you guys are like clockwork, busting balls when you get in here
I want my lawyer!
deadline's passed, Ray.
you can't change the execution method now. I'm sorry.
Salisbury steak it is.
here you go, buddy.
what are you doing?
what the hell?
there's no way to get blood out of seats like that.
Hey. It's a rental.
let's get out of here. Can I help you?
we just have a few more questions for you about Angie Gower.
why you got a rental, Mike? Excuse me?
busted up your ride, racing around town like you got a Mad Tyte JDM?
I have no idea what you just said.
Where's your car? It's in the shop.
Oh, yeah? Which shop?
I'm not sure why that's any concern of yours.
Angie Gower was seen in the vicinity of Beacon Home a few nights ago.
then she never stepped inside Beacon, like I told you.
now, if that's it
in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins
ephesians 1: 7.
you know your New Testament.
what kind of forgiveness you looking for, Pastor?
same kind you are, all of us are.
forgiveness is only part of the verse
hope of heaven, and grace to guide us through trials and tribulations.
maybe instead of looking for grace to guide you, you should own up to the truth. Thank you for your time, Pastor.
we'll get out of your hair now.
you shouldn't have done that, Holder. Last thing we need is him on the run, too.
Yeah, I need you to run a tat for me
Bible verse, Ephesians 1: 7.
Yeah, call me back as soon as you get a hit. Just as good as a print.
only if he's been processed before.
Yeah, you keep on staring, Mikey.
pastor Mike?
find everything okay?
Yeah. Thanks for letting us stay here.
um, Bullet had to meet with her P. O.
she'll be a while, but I swear, swear, swear, we won't get in your way. It's no problem.
just got a hit on your Bible verse.
your pastor's been through the system.
real name is Mark Elwood. He did time?
well, close to it. Turns out Mark Elwood, A. K.A. Pastor Mike, was charged with kidnapping a 16-year-old girl in Tempe, Arizona, six years ago.
the girl got away, but she O. D.'d before the trial, so the prosecution dropped all charges.
elwood lost his ministry.
he lost all funding for the kids' shelter he was running in Arizona.
so Pastor Mark becomes Pastor Mike, cruises up the I-5, finds a new hunting ground, gets a new alias and a new bunch of kids - no problem.
let's pick him up.
sorry. I just... got a little hungry.
it's okay. Have as much as you like.
can I ask you something?
what would you have done if you weren't able to stay here tonight?
I know your stepfather's not after you.
that was Bullet's sales pitch.
don't worry, I'm not angry.
we'd just... find somewhere in the park,
I guess, under one of the bridges.
I know what it's like to be alone.
I've had nowhere to go before, nowhere to turn.
that's no way to live.
sometimes you can't even really remember how you got there
it just happens.
you don't even look like yourself after a while.
you wonder if people notice.
and then you realize people only see what they want to see, anyway.
bullet just called.
she'll be here, like, any minute now.
Seattle P. D.! Move! Move! Spread out, spread out!
all right, let's go!
clear!
clear! Clear!
downstairs dining room - clear!
clear! Clear.
all clear.
we didn't pull the trigger fast enough.
tipped him off. He's gone.
he's not at Beacon Home, either.
the team just finished the raid. Must've just missed him.
how'd you figure that one out, genius? I was just saying.
shut your stupid little face, huh? Hey! Hey, okay!
everybody out.
please, everybody.
out.
he's a coward.
he's preying on the weakest, wearing that tattoo.
I know who this guy is. Yeah? What are you gonna do about it?
hold it together. Yeah, you're one to talk about holding things together.
okay, you're right, so maybe you should shut up and learn something.
you go down this road, you lose things. That's how it works.
that's what you've got to look forward to.
that your girl?
uh, yeah. I'm just waiting to talk to a detective.
me too.
she missing?
so's my daughter.
seven years now.
we're from Eugene, but when I heard these girls showed up in the woods,
I figured she might have made her way north.
I thought maybe one of the ones they still haven't identified yet could be a match.
Yeah, Kallie's not - she's not dead.
she's out there, somewhere, maybe hurt or something.
she always liked to wander.
she just - just picked up some bad habits from me, I guess.
looks like you got more school photos than me.
some are age composites we had done few years ago, medical files, dental records.
it's just easier to keep them than keep shuffling them from police station to police station
whoever might have a Jane Doe.
and when they turn up inconclusive or negative, you think maybe, just maybe, she's still out there.
the maybes are the hardest thing.
ms. Conrad? We're ready to see you now.
straight ahead.
open it up!
you were wrong about me having control over anything.
it's too late to change the method.
I didn't say you had control over anything. You don't.
I said that it was up to you how you exited this world.
I was talking about a choice to forgive yourself, Ray.
salvation.
salvation is a place for everybody, and there's peace there.
but - but it's a choice to go there.
they're done.
till now, I've just done lethal injection.
different than spiking some convict's vein, I'll tell you that much.
now, the bigger the inmate, the shorter the drop.
a skinny guy needs more distance to fall, make sure his neck snaps.
for this one, 165 pounds gets him six feet, four inches.
do you pull the lever, dad?
Yeah, well, they got a whole procedure rigged up.
I noose him - put the rope around his neck.
you know, I'm breaking the rules getting you in here, but, uh, this doesn't come around that often.
right and wrong, Frankie - it's a choice.
there's nothing at the pastor's house.
there's no matching weapon, no trophies.
if the pastor is good for these murders
that still doesn't make him for Trisha Seward.
only because we haven't found the connect yet.
well, we got the timeline from the M. E.
all our victims were killed between June and November 2009.
uh, Trisha Seward was killed December 26th.
that's a full month later.
so what?
we know she's different. Maybe there's a reason.
like what? I don't know.
but we have an obligation, we have a duty, to stop this execution if there's reasonable doubt, and you know it.
listen, no judge is gonna issue a stay based on a maybe, you know?
he didn't do it.
I believe you.
yeah?
okay.
they found the pastor's car.
thank you. Thank you.
we're sweeping the train station now, sir.
how many trains left in the last hour? 12.
all right, chase them down.
I want officers at the first stop for each train.
okay. This way, sir.
Yeah.
we had him, Linden.
Ashley, Kallie, all of them.
we had him.
I'm going back to headquarters.
I'll get warrants for the train station's surveillance cams.
he's got to be on one of them.
I'm sorry. We can't make a statement just yet.
get out of the way. Let me in! My girlfriend's in there!
Lyric! Watch it! Lyric!
Lyric! Hey. Easy. Settle down. Lyric!
drive.
easy, easy. Just m...
Where's your gun?
it's on my right hip, under my jacket.
and your phone? Your radio?
I don't have a radio.
my phone is in my other jacket pocket.
put on your seatbelt.
let's go.
where do you want to go?
away from the lights.
your car at the station, you wanted us to find it?
you think I wanted this?
you could have gotten on a train.
and go where? Tell me.
everything I had is here, and now it's gone.
I didn't plan anything. I... Things happen.
things can get really out of control. But I can help you.
did you want to help me when I was minding my own business?
no.
you show up on my doorstep, and you stick that badge in my face, and you have the audacity to question my intentions.
you treat me like I'm some kind of a pervert.
Why? Because I help kids.
I do what no one else wants to do.
deigns to do.
and I end up with a target on my back for it.
these kids are in so much pain.
if only you could see what's going on inside them. You have no idea.
but I see them.
don't move. Okay, you don't need to point the gun at me.
shut up.
go. Go!
all units report to king street station. Watch it, dick.
pick up your damn phone, all right?
skinner's got every uni in the city en route. Hey. What the hell?
I've been calling you all night. You don't answer your calls?
what's wrong with you? I'm a bit caught up right now.
look, between the 12 trains that already left the station, we got to eyeball about 1, 600 people. Lyric is gone!
bullet, what are you talking about?
pastor Mike took her!
what?
he made Lyric go to his house.
he wouldn't let her stay at beacon.
when? Tonight.
she called me all scared, saying he was trying to kill her.
Where'd they go? Think, bullet.
she say where they were going?
the woods.
she said he's taking her to where he killed all the other girls.
the woods we found the bodies in?
When'd your c. I. Get this?
around 8: 00. It's when she said she called, right before we hit the house.
so his car at the train station was some kind of decoy?
could be.
is the pastor that smart?
I mean, that's some "spy vs. Spy" s-.
well, he'd have to be some kind of idiot to go back to those woods.
it's what she said, Loo. We're already spread thin searching those trains.
now you want a full search of a four-mile park.
Yeah.
you trust this C. I? No doubt, sir.
pull half our guys, get them to the park.
okay. I'll call in air support. Where's Linden?
I don't know. Well, get her in!
we need all hands on deck.
if we're gonna drive around all night, do you mind if I have a cigarette?
Yes, I do. Your car already smells like an ashtray.
I do understand your work. I grew up in foster care.
bounced around different homes, different schools, even ran away a few times.
you want to know what the worst part was?
pity.
people paint a picture of you in their heads, and they don't see you, who you really are.
that's what they taught you, I suppose.
humanize yourself so the abductor won't kill you.
it won't work.
we're gonna do another sweep of the north perimeter of the park.
we still got nothing. Over.
there's a fork in the road past Lexington, pastor.
stay left.
is the park fully contained yet?
copy. Canine units aren't picking anything up. Over.
we lose the choppers in 20.
hansen, you're losing your eye in the sky.
you gotta move. We're gonna push towards the marshes, but we got nothing in the park so far. Over.
keep looking. Someone's sitting on the channel.
radio 15035.
task force, that's you. My C. I. Swore they were in the woods.
could have come and gone by now.
someone's Mike's open. Camping on the channel.
repeat - we got an open Mike from radio 15035.
that's Linden's radio. I know you're angry, but you need to think about your options.
everyone shut up!
like what?
shut up!
beacon is gone.
everything I built is gone.
Linden's with the pastor. When'd you last see her?
with you, at the train station.
you have choices right now.
but if my guys find out you're pointing a gun at me, I can't help you anymore.
dispatch to 15035, all units
all units, this is lieutenant Skinner.
an officer's making an emergency broadcast on channel 7.
all units, switch to I-tac until further notice.
if I don't report in and we keep driving around the city, someone is bound to notice.
they're in the city. Call off all searches - now!
put out a bolo on Linden's vehicle. Seattle all, king county all.
phone - what about her phone?
her phone is off, sir. I've been trying it nonstop since you told me to.
have you ever seen what heroin does to a kid?
what withdrawal is like?
when I worked the jails, yeah.
she was a junkie.
a junkie whorle.
that's all they are to this world.
human garbage, these kids.
no one cares.
no one goes looking for them.
you do.
that's right.
I do.
do you know about the girl in tempe?
never meant to hurt her.
was she your first?
why did I think I could talk to you about it?
you're a cop. You punch a clock, you collect a paycheck, and you go home and you tell everyone what a difference you made.
you're nothing but a well-trained dog.
you have no idea what being a cop is like.
you try...
but you have go to home at night, worried you didn't do enough maybe you missed something.
you fail every day, and you keep coming back.
that's what I do every day.
Yeah.
so I understand.
I do.
come on, Linden. Just keep him talking.
keep him talking. The bridge is up.
are you sure you want to go this way?
I didn't tell you to get on the bridge.
bridge is up. It's the drawbridge.
what's the range on these radios? 30, 35 Miles. She's in county, but we got multiple drawbridges.
Ballard, fremont, university find out which ones are up.
I want units over there right now. What about air support?
they ran out of fuel searching the parks.
it will be at least 20 minutes before they're in the air again.
Ballard and southwest spokane Bridges are up. Please advise.
great. They're on opposite ends of the damn city.
I want units on both of them right now. Right now!
you can talk to me.
tell me about the girl in tempe.
you said you tried to help her.
she was an addict.
I listened to her beg...
scream at me to let her out.
no other program would take her.
either they ran out of funds, they didn't have beds, they gave up , it's the same story.
let her out. " I don't - I don't understand.
well, what do you say to someone who's been throwing up and crying themselves dry for three days? "You made me promise"?
all I did was go to the store.
she got out, and she told the neighbors that I kidnapped her.
you were detoxing her?
and no one believed me.
they all looked at me like you are right now.
you know, a grown man...
with a teenage girl in his house for days.
I lost my ministry.
I lost everything. You have no idea what I went through.
you sit there and you judge me.
I lost my son.
what?
did he die?
no, not that.
I was in a custody battle with his father, and I ran out of money first.
they said he was a more fit parent than I was.
more capable of caring for my son.
so... I understand. I get it. 50 bucks says she starts crying.
you think that's funny? That's funny to you?
get out of here before I break your face.
turn in here.
what is this place?
just do what I tell you.
what's going on?
battery's dying, or they're moving out of range.
come on, Linden.
why are we here? Keep driving.
over there.
why are we here?
I used to find them hanging out down here.
turn off the car.
you...
can explain...
what really happened. They'll believe you.
no, they won't.
you didn't, did you?
you don't have to do this.
turn it off.
I'm having a cigarette.
I lied to you before.
about my son.
I didn't lose him in a custody battle.
nobody took him from me.
I lost him all on my own.
I let him go.
I didn't know how to tell him...
this is all I've got.
I can't give you...
any more.
this is what I am.
when he was 4 or 5,
I used to...
come home and he'd hear me and...
run and hide under the blankets of my bed. There'd just be this big lump...
right in the middle, and...
I'd pull back the covers...
act like it was a big surprise...
that he was in there.
he'd start cracking up.
and that was it. That was...
that was all he wanted.
he must've done it a hundred times.
sometimes the ones who hide are the ones who want to be found the most.
I don't want to be here.
can you take me to the water?
please? Yeah.
where are we going now?
you said you wanted... To go... Water.
where near the water?
that bridge over there , is that where we're going?
I found my friend standing there...
up on that bridge one night.
standing right in the middle of the highway.
why are you telling me this?
he had lost hope, too.
he thought there was no going back.
but there's always a way back.
a way home.
what he... Did.
damn battery's going.
shut up. He didn't think he could make it right. But I found him there.
he was lost and had nowhere to go.
he was standing on the median
alone, hopeless. He was my good friend, and he was up on that bridge thinking he didn't have anyone left.
the biltmore pier.
the biltmore pier. She's at the biltmore pier!
all available units, Linden's taking the suspect to biltmore pier.
get over there right now! Copy that.
I let it happen again with Angie.
she would rather bleed to death in a drain pipe than go to a hospital, go back into the system.
you were the one that took her to the vet.
I paid him $800 in small bills.
donation money.
there was a whole bunch of ones in there.
you found it, right? Yes, we did.
you should have told us the truth.
would you have believed me, knowing about tempe?
what is that?
give it to me.
give it to me! Hang on a second!
I haven't touched it.
no one's coming. It's just us.
pull the car over.
you don't have to do this.
listen to me. You don't have to do this.
you're making a mistake.
please.
just talk to me.
we can talk.
get on your knees.
I'm right here. Just talk to me.
don't do this. Please.
Oh, God.
please.
please forgive me, father.
I've fallen so short.
I don't know what to do.
I failed them.
on the pier. get your hands in the air!
put your hands up. - Show me your hands!
put your hands in the air! - Show me your hands!
stand up!
show me your hands! - Get up!
get your hands up. - Get your hands out of your pockets!
get your hands out of your pockets.
get your hands out or they'll shoot you!
he doesn't have a gun! Don't shoot him! He doesn't have a gun!
take your hands out of your pockets!
you make these men shoot you, they'll carry it all their lives.
on your knees! - Get out of the way, Sarah.
he doesn't have a gun.
on the ground. On the ground!
check that he's secure.
no weapons!
let's go.
watch yourself.
did you talk to the cop?
no, uh, she hasn't returned my calls.
I need to talk to her. There must be something she can do.
she said she believes I'm innocent.
all your appeals, the final decisions, they've come and gone.
but - but she helped put me away, so there's got to be something.
I'm sorry.
if she had anything meaningful, we'd have known by now.
there's got to be something.
I don't want to hang.
I'll take injection.
I need to ask you...
after it's done...
your remains
I need your instructions on what to do with them.
you need to talk to that cop.
if you don't make a decision, uh, there's the county grave.
it's just a marker and a number.
I'm sorry, ray.
on the gate!
come on.
come on. Come on, inmate!
get up.
Jesus! What the hell's going on? - Get up.
what's wrong with him?! Seward! - Look at me. Look at me!
damn it!
damn it, I said look at me!
look at me. Look at me!
stay looking in my eyes. Stay right here.
you're not dying! You hear me?
you're not gonna die. I want you to breathe.
slow the hell down. Just breathe.
keep looking at me. You'll be all right.
you're having a panic attack. That's all.
just breathe.
just breathe.
that's it.
okay?
okay.
what are you looking at?
let's go. Get up. Get up. Come on.
sorry, detective Linden, there's no smoking in here.
linden - Linden. - What?
how's she doing? - She's giving them hell.
I'm sorry. I can't tell you more... - ???
what about the pastor?
the lab said the blood in his car is a match for Angie gower.
but no other blood was present.
he's not our guy. - I have work to do.
he didn't do the girls in the retention pond.
he was in Mexico city for most of '09.
we just got confirmation from the embassy. - ...by the waterfront this morning.
and that girl, the one your C. I.
alleged was with the pastor?
patrol just picked her up a half-hour ago.
she was out hustling
all night.
no, he had her at his house. - She walked out.
simple as that.
so your C. I. Lied to you.
so you make this right.
the hell...? - You junkyard little bitch.
you almost got my partner killed.
you lie to me? After what I've done for you?
you think you can sit there and lie to my face?
get out of here. - Get off me!
you get out of here right now before I kick your little wannabe ass right here right now.
you ain't done nothing for me.
kallie's still out there. You ain't found her.
you ain't found nothing!
you get out of here right now before I bury your ass so deep in the foster-care system you'll never get out.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm not your friend.
I don't give a s- about you.
you're just a nobody, nothing, punk-ass kid.
now get out!
get out of here. Get out of here!
go to hell!
...and while pastor Mike sheehan has been arrested for the role he played in this morning's kidnapping, he is no longer a suspect in our ongoing serial investigation.
it's been over three weeks since the bodies were recovered.
are you any closer to an arrest?
the bottom line is, my guys are working 24 hours a day following every possible lead.
lieutenant, are you losing confidence in the ability of the task force to even catch this killer?
absolutely not. I have full confiden
you left your keys in the door.
I got chow mein, egg rolls, lemon chicken for you, and fortune cookies.
what more could you want?
lyric, what the hell? Are you okay?
where have you been? What happened?
nothing. Jesus.
you told the cops I was missing?
they questioned me out here for like an hour. They called my parents.
why didn't you call me, find me, something?
find you? I don't belong to you.
I'm with twitch. Okay?
sorry.
I'm not gay.
you know?
yo, poochie.
you holding?
Yeah. So? You don't mess with no junk.
look, just sell to me or don't. I ain't got time for your Ratchet ass.
it's all good, girl. Damn.
so, what, you want points?
any word on kallie?
it sucks, yo. I'm sorry.
whatever. Later.
Hey, you be careful, b. Some girl copped from not two hours ago.
she had her finger chopped off.
what do you mean?
it's crazy, right? Said she was gettin' the hell out of dodge.
thanks for the takeout. Nice of you to do that.
Yeah, well, you are welcome.
I needed an excuse to get out of there anyway.
if one more person asks me if I was all right,
I swear...
well, are you all right?
Yeah. I'm fine.
thought I lost you there for a second.
just when I was getting used to you.
that was scary, huh?
I couldn't see him, you know? Just his eyes in the mirror.
and his voice.
I kept thinking that this must have been what it was like for all those girls.
how alone they must have felt.
just his eyes, you know, looking at them.
knowing that that was the last thing that they were gonna see.
only it wasn't him.
I should have got there sooner.
you got there. You found me.
you go through that thing every night or what?
they're gonna kill him in two days.
Francis didn't happen to tell you where he was going after work, did he?
just going home.
he hasn't been home in a couple of days.
look, I know what you must think of me, but... It ain't easy living with a man like him.
well, he's got a temper, but he's not a bad guy.
sometimes he doesn't come home for nights on end.
and when he comes home, he looks at me...
I hate me.
I'm... Sorry. I don't know what I can do.
I don't have anyone to talk to.
I'm scared.
can you just sit with me?
just for a little while.
I just need somebody - just to talk to.
I'm sorry.
you're Angie, right?
who the hell are you? - Bullet. Friend of poochie's.
so?
look, you want to take off. I get that.
but there are a lot of girls that are still out there that need your help.
no, I can't. The man...
he'll find you.
he'll find me if I stay.
he'll kill me.
and ain't nothing no one gonna do about it.
whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
I- I told you I saw poochie, right?
Yeah. So did I. - Hey, look. Look, it's a long ride.
I can help take the edge off.
I got what I need. - Yeah?
what about when you get there?
dope sick ain't no way to start a new life. This is yours.
just tell me who he is. - I can't.
please.
there's nothing new here.
I've been through these a million times.
the guy loves his kid. That ain't no grift.
birthday candle, ding-dong.
it's more than my pops ever done for me.
you're right. I think he does care.
he's still gonna die.
my nephew davie...
pops ran out on him, too, before he was even born.
told myself - I promised that I'd be that to him.
you know, 'cause he didn't have anyone else.
didn't stop me from stealing from him.
you're there for them now, right?
don't change what happened.
doesn't matter how long I'll be clean.
they're always gonna be looking at me like...
like they're watching...
just waiting for me to fail.
that wasn't the impression your sister gave me.
or your nephew.
maybe it's you who needs to let go of the past.
that makes two of us, huh?
look...
all I'm saying is, there's no telling what seward might have done even if he loved his kid.
so you think he did it.
what proof we got otherwise?
when we find the guy, then we'll know.
and speaking of - I gotta get some sleep.
take a shower.
it's real bad. It's real bad.
back to Joe mills' home videos first thing.
you got tunnel vision.
let me take a crack at this.
knock yourself out.
you've reached detective Stephen Holder. Leave a message.
look, I know I messed up, man, but I got something for you, for real.
call me back as soon as you can.
I know who he is.
Hey, I been here five minutes.
a menu would be nice. - Yep!
you have a prepaid call from Elliot bay penitentiary.
Hello? - Did you talk to Adrian?
no.
his foster parents won't let me.
Yeah, but you think he knows something, and that's why you want to talk to him.
I can make that happen.
I didn't kill my wife.
I wasn't there, and you believe me, don't you?
I do, yes. - Yeah, well, I'm running out of time.
I'll make sure you can talk to Adrian.
you need to help me.
please.
you've reached detective Stephen Holder. Leave a message.
Joe!
Joe! Joe!
you've been in there for 54... 55 minutes, Joe!
masturbation is fun. I get it.
it's not very green to do it with the shower running.
Jesus!
bring your briefs in there with you.
you're 15 years old.
it's not cute anymore.
got his mother's fanny.
your final was due a week ago, Joe.
I mean, look... look at the board.
school's over.
we're playing hangman here.
there you are.
Hey.
so, are you guys around tonight?
because you should totally come to Thirsty Thursdays.
End-of-school tradition. - Yeah. Yeah, totally.
I'll... I'll be there. - Cool.
so it's at Wolf's Pond, whenever you...
Oh... my God.
eat shit, Toy!
I can lend you a shirt.
I've got like five in my locker.
you know what, actually, it doesn't look that bad.
so, pregame at Paul's at like 7: 00-ish.
paul has his own apartment?
what, you're not going to acknowledge me?
Hi. - Mmm. Yeah.
um, I will see you tonight.
Yes. Yeah, uh...
babe. - Yes?
let's go get egg bagels.
okay. All right. Bye.
Paul. God.
I need a shirt.
that's awesome.
that is... that is great.
actually, I need a picture. Shit, can I get my phone?
Hey. Mrs. Keenan?
Shh!
Patrick, why are you running around?
Oh... grandma, you remember Joe.
Hi, Mrs. Keenan.
darling, would you like a cold washcloth?
what? No. No washcloth.
how about you, Joseph?
actually, yeah, I would... I'd love a washcloth.
no, Mom, sit. What the hell? What the hell is happening?
my mom reminds me of Blanka.
that's the sound I hear whenever she speaks.
just the gibberish of an undisciplined animal.
it's never going to end. Even when I'm an adult, she'll find me, question me.
you're being a little dramatic, I think.
Joe, they're giving me hives.
there's no way that they can give you hives.
holy shit.
Hey, kiddo.
round two. Fight!
what, Dad? - Should be a stud here.
Oh, what's all this?
Carol's going to be here in 30.
go wash up. - Uh, Dad, you know, um,
I actually just realized I have a party tonight, so I'm not going to be able to make it for dinner and stuff.
sorry.
too bad.
the plans are already made.
your sister's driving all the way in.
I'm making lamb stew.
are we in Beowulf?
look, after dinner,
I was thinking we might bring back Game Night.
it'll be fun.
game... Game Night's a family thing, Dad.
I'm not going to play Game Night with some spider woman you found in the gutter.
Carol is not a spider woman that I found in the gutter, Joe.
she's a very nice lady who happens to like me.
and I like her.
so, we haven't played Game Night since Mom died, and then, all of a sudden, you meet some floozy and expect...
enough! Enough, Joe.
this is not a debate.
my house, my rules.
now, go get ready.
so, Joe, your dad told me that you go to Tottenville.
are you on any teams?
Carol, before we go any further, you should know...
Frank is not my real father.
I love him, and I owe him a lot.
you know, he's very special to me, but he's not my blood.
is that true, Frank?
that's completely untrue.
I'm taking Ventnor.
Frank, the lamb was delicious.
just so tender and...
it was like I was chewing avocado meat.
I'm not sure I know what you're saying, Colin.
avocado meat.
Heather, do you remember when Dad quit because, um, you wouldn't trade him B&O?
remember that? - Oh... oh, do I remember when my own father called me a "fear-mongering Chinaman?
Yeah, I do... mostly 'cause I'm not a man.
nor am I Chinese, so...
Oh, my God, what a panic.
that's something my great-grandfather would say.
he's a racist.
you do that often?
eat the hamburger and then the fries?
you don't... you don't mix it up?
I don't know, Dad.
just asking.
we watched a very good movie on the cable last night.
Mmm. - Oh, honey, what was it called?
it had that guy in it, that actor...
what was it? - What's his name?
called, uh, Heimlich, the...
Yes, yes! With, uh, what's his name.
the Prince, the... the New Prince.
will Smith?
will! Yes. Will Prince.
will Prince. - Oh, my gosh, what does he play?
superhero? - Oh, he plays a superhero in this one.
kind of a supe... not a cape, though.
Yeah, it's called Heimlich. - The darnedest thing.
come on.
you want to be my buddy?
Yes. I would love that.
Tennessee for Park Place.
right now, straight up.
done.
you got it.
what? No. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
the men are talking, Joseph. Pipe down. - Yes. Quiet.
quiet, everybody, except for the men.
we're in command of the room. - This is bullshit, Dad.
you're pricing me out of the goddamn game.
your roll, JoJo.
this is collusion.
dad, come on.
Yeah, it's kind of cruel, Frank.
no, no.
he's just mad because he doesn't want to be here, so he's being a little shit.
Oh, great. - Oh, no.
Joe, don't go.
he's quitting. That's nice work, Dad.
he'll be all right.
let him walk it off.
Patrick, have you been washing that foot every day?
because moisture can get trapped in there from the brace.
that's what killed Jim Henson, you know.
Oh...
what the hell are we talking about?
Ooh, Patrick, can you whistle?
I like it when you harmonize with me on the whistling.
Patty, where you going? - Got to go potty?
Oh, shit, he's doing it.
Joe!
Joe!
Joe...
Yeah, I'd like to report a theft.
goddamn it!
Yeah, his name is Frank Toy.
brown hair, uh, height unknown.
I'll call you back.
you son of a bitch.
but...
the problem with Joseph's habit is that one day there will be an actual emergency or violent crime coming from this house.
Yeah, well, the night is still young.
uh, Mr. Toy, are you familiar with "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"?
Yes. I experienced a childhood on the planet Earth, so...
Yes, I've heard of that one.
do you think you can apply it to my situation in an allegorical fashion?
okay. It's a...
a story that involves a boy who... - Ah, ah, ah...
constantly cries "wolf." - Stop.
and when the wolf finally comes... he doesn't know it.
I'm sorry, "The Boy Who Cried" what? - Wolf.
fuck you. - Let's go.
the Boy Who Cried what? - Stop talking.
wolf. - Get the fuck off my porch before I knock your dick in the dirt.
come on, let's go. - I don't see what the problem was.
why are you yelling at me? - What's next? Three Little Pigs?
it gets easier. Okay? Honest. I swear.
in two years, he's going to pay for you to leave.
Yeah.
uh, look, this may sound desperate, but I am 100% lucid, okay?
don't smile, 'cause I'm...
don't. - No, this is very serious.
I am serious. - I'm taking you so seriously.
I can be packed in 15 minutes.
just take me with you to Granville.
please.
okay, I would.
totally would, but...
dad would want to come visit us all the time, and that just wouldn't work for me.
you're lame. - So...
take it easy on him.
you're getting so handsome. - Yeah. Yeah.
I love you. - Hey, don't you touch me.
you love it.
Oh, hey. Hey.
what's up? - Okay, I am going to get you a beer so you can catch up.
okay.
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
what's up, dude? - Hey.
how was, uh, fake family night?
Oh, it was great.
nothing went wrong.
the police didn't come.
I love my father.
shit.
okay, I have beer for you. - Hey. Thank you.
hello. Hello. - Hello, Kelly.
how are you? - I'm good. How are you?
I'm not as drunk as you are.
I think you are.
can I have your beer? - No.
Hey, sorry, bro. Keg's almost tapped.
no beer for freshmen.
Oh, but he is a sophomore now, Paul.
sorry, babe.
no dice, bro.
Oh, man.
you little fuck-suckers!
we're trying to sleep!
it's public property, bro!
what?
who told you that?
we assumed!
I don't trust that old guy.
he has a shadow behind his eyes.
how long have you been standing there?
hello.
that's not an answer.
you little shit dicks!
Oh, my... - Jesus! Let's go, let's go.
what the hell are you doing, guys? Come on!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Let's go! Let's go!
come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Hey, Joe, do you know we've been walking for half a mile?
I can tell by how much we've bonded.
well, we're lost, and, um...
game... Game Night's a family thing, Dad.
how much longer?
I have no idea, Biaggio.
let's just keep our wits, and we'll get out of here.
where are we?
someplace they won't find you.
what?
let's go, man.
we got a long walk home.
Hello? Hi.
Hi.
I just wanted to make sure that you didn't get shot last night.
no. No, no, no.
I survived.
I, uh, wound up getting stuck with that kid Biaggio, though.
Oh, yeah, I spoke to him once.
he told me that his uncle died on the Challenger.
that's the price of space travel, right?
uh... yeah, sure.
um, so get ready for this.
paul skedaddled on me last night.
uh, wow, that's... that's a dick move.
tools... out of the driveway now.
I'm on the phone. - Oh.
I don't give a shit. Right now.
is everything okay there?
No! - Who is this? Patrick?
Kelly. - Kelly. A girl.
Jesus, that's a pleasant surprise. - Dad...
listen, Kelly, Joe can't talk right now because he's grounded.
he will call you back sometime before his hot new bedtime of 7: 30.
you have a good night.
okay.
tools. Now.
and if they're ruined, you're going to work the whole set off this summer. I mean it.
a paper route.
big Chief Indian Corn.
goddamn Ohio Soccer Jazz. I don't care.
you have your pick.
this bullshit ends today.
Yes, it does.
I can't walk all day like this, Joe.
okay. We're almost there.
just 50 yards.
almost where?
what the hell could you be showing me in the woods right now?
what is this, Joe?
you want your room facing sunrise or sunset?
my what?!
this is the site of our new house, man.
what, like a tree house?
no, like a real house.
I'm moving out. We're moving out.
what the hell are you talking about?
my mom won't let me walk around the house without socks on.
she's definitely not going to let us live out here in the woods.
no one will find us out here, Patrick.
this house, this land, it's ours!
we make the rules, you know?
like men!
so we're just going to move out here and, uh, build a house from scratch?
how hard can it be?
hold on... what is this kid doing here?
I don't know.
I'm afraid to tell him to leave.
I don't know what he's capable of.
forget him.
break ground with me, man.
look, I'm sorry, Joe, but I can't do this.
call me when you get home.
Patrick?
so you wore the blue shirt today?
not the one with the pocket?
he's got the blue one on. - Yeah.
whoa, rope in the attitude, mister.
this is your mother you're speaking to.
come on, buddy. Come on. - Huh? Huh?
sorry, Dad. - Who is he doing a show for?
Oh, my gosh, I know, it's like he's on camera.
are there girls around?
Yeah, there must be. Uh-oh.
girl check.
checking for a girl in a bikini.
Nope. I don't see one.
Hello?
I'm in.
what? - The house.
I'll do it.
Yes! Yes! Holy shit! Yes!
okay. Awesome.
well, we'll break ground tomorrow.
Yeah, right.
Hello?
Joe, what do you tell your dad when you leave all the time?
if we were talking, I still wouldn't tell him shit.
Jesus, what happened between you two?
nothing.
he's just an old, lonely prick, and I want to get out of there before I end up anything like him.
Joe?
can I talk to you for a second?
you made this? - I did.
took very little time.
very few days.
my name is Jamal Colorado, and I have kidnapped your son.
he is unharmed, and will stay that way if you abide by the following rules.
Jamal Colorado"?
Anfernee Texas"?
D'Sean Utah"?
Yeah, I decided on the format of Denzel Washington:
a black first name, followed by a state.
Yeah, fuck that. We're not using those.
okay, Biaggio, good effort...
although very poorly planned out and, um... savagely racist.
I just didn't want to do nothing.
dad, um...
I'm gonna spend the night at Patrick's tonight, if that's okay.
okay, and make sure you're in bed by 7: 30.
I'll call the Keenans.
freedom!
fuck you, Frank!
honey, I got the classic ciabatta bread.
they finally had it. - You're getting wild.
sliced. - Yeah.
this is our big day. - You're crazy.
we usually do rustic ciabatta.
I know it.
mom, Dad, I'm going to spend the night at Joe's.
Oh, okay, honey.
well, I already made dinner, though, so take some vegetable soup for you and Joe.
uh, no, thanks.
no one likes vegetable soup, Mom.
well...
okay, we're in Pretendland, I guess.
nobody likes vegetable soup.
did you hear this, honey? - I heard it.
Oh, my God. - He's your son.
listen, tell Mr. Toy to put some white rice underneath it.
it'll be delightful.
mom, no.
no vegetable soup.
we're not eating vegetable soup.
I'm getting a Tupperware.
here, take this tomato.
Jesus.
you okay, fatty?
no.
no, I'm not.
I... I'm really nervous.
we're really doing this, huh?
Yes, we are.
I've never done anything like this, Joe.
it's starting to freak me out.
well, uh, neither have I.
kind of the point.
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
just, okay, before I make a big decision,
I always, you know, say to myself,
I'll do it unless God gives me a definitive omen in the next 30 seconds.
so, you know, it's just some dumb superstition I have.
if you don't want to do it, that's fine.
but...
do you want to?
sure, yeah.
it's...
Yeah, so just like, close your eyes, and yeah.
you got it.
Oh.
okay, let's go.
wait, what?
no, no, that was thunder.
definitely a bad omen.
no, come on, that was thunder.
that's a tree. This is a rock.
come on, man, it's nature.
it's not an omen.
have some common sense.
common sense? - It's not like a raven told us to go away.
Yeah, we're doing this.
Oh, God.
ready?
all right, let's unpack.
I came early.
Oh, shit.
dude.
Oh, my God.
fuck, yeah.
Patrick.
what the f...? Jesus.
what time is it, man? - Who cares?
we're out in the woods.
there's no time in the woods.
let's go exploring.
what? - What?
of course there's time in the woods.
you go outside and you look at the...
the sun, and the higher it is in the sky, the later it is in the day.
we do swear, "under pain of friendship lost, "to never speak "of this enterprise to any adult, "and to never betray its location "or its participants, "and from this day forthwith "to boil our own water, "kill our own food, build our own shelter and be our own men.
all right, we need cool names for everything.
like, awesome, mythical names.
no, we don't. - Or, uh...
the Trees of Destiny.
Oh!
no. - No! The map!
Aah!
so, Patrick's a wrestler? - Oh, very good one.
Yes, a good one. - Very good wrestler.
so what's that, Greco-Roman or arena?
don't answer that.
Greco-Roman. What's arena?
arena is pro.
do you think that Joe would run away - to prove a point? - Oh, hold on now.
we don't know that they've run away.
I mean, there is absolutely no reason that Patrick would run away.
not for Patrick to run away, no.
okay. - You're right.
it's a classic kidnapping.
they took our children and the canned goods and pasta.
all right, look, I hate to admit it, but Frank is right. Right now, we have to assume that these are voluntary disappearances.
Wow. What do you know?
the police, always pushing their pig Irish agendas.
whoa.
Mrs. Keenan, I assure you, there is no other agenda than to find your son right now.
no. The Irish are the blacks of Europe.
the blacks of Europe.
Oh, my God. - Period.
that's powerful stuff. - That's not...
okay, wow.
sweetheart, I'm Irish, okay?
we're under a lot of stress, Captain.
I'm sorry about...
you know Patrick was our only boy.
is. - Did you know that?
Yes, I do. - Did you?
I'm well aware.
listen, according to the report, $80 to $100 in food and housewares is missing.
from the Toy house, we are down a tool set, grill utensils and about $240 in cash.
now, I presume we're not pressing charges.
Frank, would you like to press charges against Joe?
not at this time.
he took the Monopoly, too.
obviously to spite me.
maybe he just wanted something to remember you by.
no way.
he hates that damn game. Did you see him the other night?
well, he used to love it, you know, when it was, like, the four of us.
you're kind of shitting on his memories, Dad.
well, what am I supposed to do, Heather?
you know, if I died, he'd get over it in about six weeks.
uh, sir, Chinese food is here, so I would like to actually...
how much?
uh, it's $51.
$51?
what the hell did you order? Heather?
don't look at me. I got dumplings.
I'm not even hungry.
Yeah, I actually ordered a...
a large portion of the shrimp with lobster sauce.
I figured it was pretty neutral.
we can eat it family-style.
neutral? - Mm-hmm.
shrimp with lobster sauce?
Yeah.
I can't think of a more marginal dish in any culture.
Hi. - Hey.
what's your name?
my American name is Gary.
you ever have one of those days, Gary?
what kind of days?
the kind I'm having right now.
I don't know what kind of day you're having.
where you feel like somebody is pissing in your face all day long.
is that good or bad?
bad. - Bad.
Gary, every time...
you see those wontons, Gary?
you see the size of them? - Mm-hmm.
those wontons are too big, my friend.
everybody loves those. People ask us for the recipe.
we won't provide it.
it's part of our training... how to deal with people who want the recipe too bad.
Oh? - We have a phrase we have to repeat.
what is that? - "We won't provide it.
I can see the value of these now.
I can have the kids from the neighborhood come over and bounce up and down on them at a fucking party.
Oh, sarcasm, I get it. - It's like a bouncy house.
the poor man's wit.
my question for you, Gary, is:
how do you want me to eat these with my normal human mouth?
do you want me to unhinge my jaw like an anaconda?
should I put this in my belly and lay out in the sun - for two months, digesting it? - Dad, enough! My God!
just pay the poor guy. - My God. Yeah, and maybe you should get some forks in the house so your dad doesn't have to unhinge his stupid jaw to...
we're done here, and for the record, your wontons are way too big. Nobody can fucking eat those.
no, I can eat them; just give them to me.
good night, Gary. - I'd be very happy to eat those.
your house has a bad vibe.
no more rice, no more pasta.
it's time to eat an honest meal.
Biaggio?
you and I will take to the trees.
Patrick, you, uh...
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I... I pick berries and apples and forage.
and it makes a lot of sense, yeah.
Oh, what?
you should be the hunter just because you're stronger?
Yeah.
Oh, don't...
don't drink the water.
uh... uh, I shouldn't have done that.
I'm glad you came out, Biaggio.
I mean, this is...
this is our rite of passage, goddamn it.
have you ever felt this at one with... with yourself?
with your instincts, with nature?
this...
this masculine?
I don't know.
I don't really see myself as having a gender.
is that a problem?
it's not great.
this way to the bison, my friend.
when you get up here, you can see a field of bison majestically grazing.
Ooh, get your weapon ready.
Yeah.
let's go, Biaggio. Come on.
no, but the...
Boston Market, that's...
that's from our old life, our weak life.
wait here.
what will it attract... scavengers?
scavengers? Look at this.
fit for a goddamn king.
are there any bears in these woods?
hope so.
a bear would feed us for a month.
perhaps we can disillusion him.
a bear who doesn't believe in anything will be easier to bring down.
I... I guess I agree with that.
might be a little small.
one, two, three, four, five.
you have a tag on your pants.
did you buy new clothes for this?
it comes like that... it's the style.
Yes!
okay, come on.
no, the swords.
we got it.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, God, okay.
flip, flip, flip the thing, and I'll, uh... I'll take its life.
strike it at its neck. Don't compromise the meat.
I know, I know. - It may plead; don't listen.
be cold, clinical with the blade. - I will.
it may try to bargain... this is natural.
just turn it! - Okay!
Yeah, I'm just surprised you found a live chicken in these woods.
Yup, yes, sir.
that's amazing.
Biaggio, your corn pudding is to die for.
I have to know the recipe.
Mmm.
Oh, God.
so smug.
dude, food attracts mice.
and you know what mice attract?
stupid fucking questions? - No.
they attract snakes.
in Italian, the word for "snake means "the demon's cock."
no, it doesn't. - There's a chance that it doesn't.
whatever, dude.
from here on out, all the food goes either in the fire or in the ground.
God, man, you're so doom and gloom all the time. Just enjoy this.
it's not doom and gloom, bro.
I just found a copperhead skin two hours ago.
I read once that animals see fear as a color.
I thought you can't read.
no, I can read.
I can't cry.
well, there you go.
okay, we traced Joe and Patrick's cell phones to this bus.
Savanovic, Dietzel, check under the seats, see if the bathroom's locked.
this is an artist's projection of what he might look like now.
the beard may be a little full.
they aren't here.
this is a waste of real time, Davis.
you can check under the bus if you want.
there's not a lot of air that can make it under there, but...
listen to me. Our son ran away about eight years ago.
I'm sorry. Did he come back? - So, he came back?
well, it was a really hard time for us. - Uh, thank you.
Jesus, we don't need this right now, sir. Are you okay?
uh, what does he mean? - He doesn't mean anything.
you need to lean on each other. - Sir.
Oh, my God. - Get him back on the bus.
Davis. - No, I don't want to get on the bus.
I'm a licensed therapist!
this is Joe's bag.
it's empty.
that's Patrick's phone. - That's Joe's.
some dude had a beeper?
that's dope.
w-wait a minute.
what... what is that?
what does that mean?
it's a Monopoly piece.
my piece.
he's taunting me.
he's like the Zodiac Killer.
okay, the worst thing you can do is hope right now.
I'm just letting you know.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
we have to do this for real. Ready?
one, two... a... one, two, three, four!
Cheers.
we have water, shelter. We can put a balanced meal on the table. I mean, we answer to no one.
we're men.
just now?
just happened?
just happened, man.
you don't say.
all I'm saying is that if anything was missing from all of this...
it'd be a woman's touch.
we have Biaggio.
doesn't count.
right here. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
hello. - Got to get my drink on.
Hi. Do you guys want anything?
uh, I got a Titleist right here.
it's worth like $3. 50, so if I could get a Sun Chips and a beer and then 50 cents in change, that would be fantastic.
okay, well, we do not run on a barter system.
what the fuck is a "barger" system?
barter. - Barger?
when you use equal goods or services instead of cash.
so you admit that these are equal goods - in your barger system. - Yeah, but we do not run on a barter system.
that's not the point.
you're on the news, Joe. Your dad was on K-19.
okay, please.
my dad is loving every second of this, okay?
no, Joe, I seriously doubt that.
so, uh...
does Patrick have a really big, crazy beard now, too?
Yeah, yeah, his is a little more serious than mine.
I have... I have thin hair.
you know, you have to groom it.
Oh, right.
Yeah, like Paul's sick-ass goatee?
uh...
I guess you wouldn't have heard...
paul and I broke up.
Oh.
this isn't over, Kelly.
this isn't over, Kelly!
uh... uh, no, I did not catch wind of that.
um...
I'm sorry, though.
I, uh, came here actually to invite you to dinner.
uh, sort of like a... a housewarming thing.
if you want. - Yeah, obviously I want to, but how do I... how do I get there?
do I have to...be blindfolded or something?
in all seriousness, it's of absolute vital importance that you not tell anyone, - not bring anyone. No one. - Yes.
this is life or death, Kelly. - Okay, okay, okay.
okay.
bitch.
Joe.
dude.
Biaggio.
you're camouflaged horribly.
dude!
Where's Joe?
what's up, man?
what's up?
have you seen Joe?
no, I don't know where he is.
but where's Biaggio?
you're right here.
you're right... Oh, God.
okay, fine, fine.
we bought a few chickens.
less than 30, more than 25.
but the fact is Biaggio and I have been hunting and getting pretty goddamn dangerous out there.
this is hypocrisy.
Joe, listen to yourself. How can you sleep at night?
look, I can deal with the fact that the chickens were store-bought.
okay? I can.
but it really bothers me that the loaded potato isn't Biaggio's recipe.
no. No, no, that actually really is.
I... I honestly have no idea where he's getting chives.
so, um, can I pass or...?
Judy keeps saying that wherever they are, at least they have each other.
I guess that calms me down sometimes, you know?
I got to wonder whose idea it all was.
Yeah.
wait, are you serious?
it could have been Patrick's idea.
no way. - Oh, my gosh.
Joe is the one who drove them to the movies when they were nine.
remember? Only reason they got caught is 'cause they went through a drive-through.
sunfish. Damn it.
Joe is the one who tied Patrick's pet turtle to a kite.
wanted to send him up into space.
I forgot about that.
are you laughing?
are you laughing at that?
it was... it was more of a laugh of admiration.
for the murder of a turtle?
the turtle died, then?
Yeah, the turtle died, Frank.
I suppose that's a shame.
the problem is Joe's a mama's boy.
clarissa was good for him.
she just let him be.
something about his innate sense of menace seemed to charm her.
now it's just the two of us.
I... I'm afraid I broke him.
I mean, our sons did run away.
they don't... they don't want to be with us.
they don't want to live in our houses.
I guess maybe... we did do something wrong, you know?
what the heck?
Ah.
Patrick is the one who set up Bicycle Olympics in my goddamn swimming pool.
that was a nice $1, 300 repair job.
I never called you about that.
thought we were having a moment just then, Frank.
and Bicycle Olympics was Joe's idea.
goddamn it.
Joe, I love it here.
I want to spend the rest of my days with you.
that's an emotional fact for me.
Yes, but...
but I worry.
I can't keep my brain from worrying.
my...
my woman brain.
Ah, my sweet Kelly, why should we let it ruin this moment?
Joe!
it's time to come home.
leave us, Frank.
the forest is ours.
you made a fool of me in front of the whole town, boy.
a harlequin.
he is a man grown, and his path is his own to choose.
silence, land-trunt.
you win.
perfect.
Joe. Hey, bro, we got company.
lots of company.
Hi, brother.
all right.
this is so great, Joe.
yo, bros, what did you guys do with this chicken?
melts in your goddamn mouth, right?
so, um, do you guys eat the same thing every night?
Yeah, a lot of chicken.
they're everywhere here.
right, Joe? - Oh.
all sorts of them.
Yeah, Patrick, um, he usually takes care of the gathering, you know, berries, roots.
I take care of the meat and the protein.
and the shopping.
he's a great bargain hunter.
I do the hunting.
so, Biaggio, what do you do?
I met a dog the other day that taught me how to die.
Yeah, uh, Biaggio here, he's a...
he's a real renaissance man.
I have incredible focus.
you should see his hands. So quick.
this cat right here, he can snatch trout right out of the goddamn stream.
just...
bullshit.
no, it's true. I've seen it.
I rest my case.
did you take anything out?
no, he doesn't want your money.
he just does it for sport.
you know, um,
I picked those flowers myself.
Oh, yeah. They're really pretty.
so what is this all supposed to be?
this is the den.
Oh, this is the den.
how stupid of me.
um, and that...
that is the master bedroom.
Wow.
this is really amazing, Joe.
I mean, I had no idea how talented you were.
I mean, of course, I suspected, but...
of course. Right. - Of course.
that's horrible.
Yeah. Uh...
Vicki's making eyes at you, man.
go talk to her. Look at her.
she's so into it.
there's no point in me talking to her anyways.
why not?
Joe...
I'm gay.
are you sure? Um...
Yes.
my lungs fill up with fluid every time the seasons change.
that's not being gay, Biaggio.
what?
I'm pretty sure that's cystic fibrosis.
Oh.
Biaggio, I don't know why you're smiling... cystic fibrosis is not a walk in the park.
it's actually a very serious medical...
Hey, what... what about Kelly?
she's just doing what... all girls do.
you know?
pretending like she doesn't care.
playing hard to get. I don't know.
Oh, man.
Hey.
Patrick?
yeah? - Can you sleep?
um... yeah.
well, do you want to go for a walk or something?
cause I can't sleep.
sure. - Okay.
Hey, Joe?
Joe, we're leaving.
are you awake?
Biaggio!
Jesus Christ, dude.
stay above the surface where I could see you, okay?
um... look, I'm gonna go for a walk.
don't wait up.
you should try not to think about them so much.
Yeah, uh...
I'm sorry I'm not more fun to be around right now.
call me with anything.
okay? Anything. I'm not far.
Yeah. Thanks.
take care, Colin.
have fun with... singing.
Oh. Thank you. Thank you very much.
um, I'm actually part of a...a cappella band called Mmm.
so long.
uh, we're actually, uh, performing 12-part harmony to, uh, "And the Band Played On.
good night. - Do you know the song?
uh, I'll just do the chorus, then, just real fast.
Oh, babe, I don't think it's...
# Casey would waltz #
# With the strawberry blonde #
# And the band #
# Played on # - Thank you.
# He'd glide cross the floor with the girl #
# He adored, and the #
# Band played on #
great.
# His brain was so loaded #
# It nearly #
# Exploded # - Still going.
# The poor girl would shake with alarm #
# He'd never leave the girl with the #
# Strawberry curls #
# And the #
# Band #
# Played... #
# On... # - Okay. Oh, babe.
babe.
I think I may never get an erection again.
dad! Jesus!
well... I mean...
uh, it was good seeing you again.
all right, drive safe.
Aw, come on.
come on, honey, he just...
serenaded me... I can't pretend - that's acceptable. - Right.
thanks for giving it the old college try.
I appreciate it. I got to go.
shit, I'm sorry.
Heather.
I'm not a bastard, am I?
no, Dad, a bastard would make everyone around him miserable just 'cause he is.
Hey.
Hey, uh, we...
you do your thing. Just...
I'll see you kids...back at the house.
look... don't worry.
he could never be mad at you.
you guys are like brothers.
this is different.
this is way different.
did this work?
running away?
I mean, are you really happy out here?
Yeah. You know, I'm just...
I'm happy to be wherever my parents are not.
Ah...
is anything better than a good stogie, Biaggio?
being in a situation where it's easier to lie but you choose to tell the truth.
hmm.
guess that is better.
okay, I will trade you B&O Railroad for both your utilities.
and this "Get Out of Jail Free" card.
deal.
deal. That's a good deal.
that's a good trade.
what?
Yeah.
all four railroads for the utilities and your "Get Out of Jail Free" card.
savvy.
Oh, look at that...
free Parking."
you know what?
I think I'm gonna buy some more houses.
how many is more"?
give me a second.
actually...
Biaggio, I will give you Baltic,
park Place and both my greens - for both your oranges. - I want $1, 000.
I'll give you $50. - Okay.
pleasure doing business with you.
you just went from $1, 000 to $50?
the men... are talking.
Yes, Patrick, the men are talking.
realtor, could I please get - three hotels? - Oh, yeah, sure. On what?
orange. What I just bought.
there you go, property manager.
what's up, Joe?
nothing's up.
it's your roll.
look, Joe, if I roll a six, an eight or a nine, things are gonna get very bad in here.
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
just think of all the other numbers in the world.
is everything okay with you guys?
Yeah.
we're golden.
what was that play, Joe?!
Jesus! It is a game! - That was the lowest, shittiest, dickhead move I've ever seen.
second lowest.
Wow.
no one was ever trying to hurt you, Joe.
it was never about you!
we just... It just happened!
get over it! - I'm over it!
the bitch wants you, then she's not good enough for me anyway!
who the fuck are you, Mary J. Blige?
Jesus Christ! - Joe, I...
shut up, Kelly! All right?
everything was fine until you came into the picture.
you're like... Jesus, you're like a cancer!
uh...
I'm gonna go.
what was that, Joe?
you know what? Go be with her.
go hang with Kelly and your goddamn mother.
I don't... Joe, I don't want to go.
Joe, I want to stay here.
you want to stay here? - This is the most fun I've ever had.
we built this house together!
go be with her, man, hmm? - Joe, I don't want to go.
get out of here, man! - Come on, man, I didn't...
come on!
I'll get the tools.
we'll fix it.
leave me alone, Biaggio.
what do you mean?
I'm saying I want to be alone.
go away.
don't mince words with me, Joe.
we've been through too much.
just leave.
Kelly!
Kelly.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I didn't want to come between friends.
I've just... I've...
No!
damn it!
God...!
fuck!
we didn't want to wake you.
Yeah.
welcome home, Patrick.
stop.
Yep.
glad you're back.
the report says this boy was with him the whole week.
he's given us nothing so far.
he has a contempt for the law
I've never seen in a minor.
look at him. He won't sit down.
he won't deflate the room.
it's actually quite sophisticated.
this kid is in my head.
if you need to leave, Sergeant, there's no shame in it.
Yeah, maybe just to...splash a bit of cold water on my face.
there is shame in it, but please leave anyway.
Oh, God.
and Patrick?
he says he hasn't seen Joe since they split up.
no.
it stays on.
Oh, my God.
dude!
Hey!
dude, this is my spot, man! You're ruining my spot!
I thought you said you'd never been here before.
I haven't.
freak.
I'm sorry. - Come on.
I got another spot.
no fear!
sorry.
we were just... hungry.
I guess we were all just hungry.
sorry I yelled.
goddamn it.
save the heart and liver if you wish and cut from rectum to collar bone.
well, anyway, if you guys are going to go hunting, you're going to need these.
uh, they're masks that you wear on the back of your head to keep the animals away from you.
to keep them from stalking you, essentially.
this is yours... on the back of your head.
this one supposed to be me?
Yeah.
Hello?
whoa.
whoa.
on now to the story which has captivated much of Tottenville County.
where is Joseph Toy?
it's been more than four weeks since the 15-year-old left home.
toy's friend Patrick Keenan returned home safely this past Tuesday with his family calling it, quote, "a miracle.
Keenan claims he hasn't seen Toy in weeks.
toy is described as approximately five-foot-seven, with straight brown hair and blue eyes.
anyone with information regarding Joseph Toy should call the Tottenville County Sheriff's Department.
coming up: Could caffeine lead to longer, stronger...
sure.
every man has.
well, there's good quitting and bad quitting, Biaggio.
quit drinking soda, good quitting.
I quit low school, bad quitting.
do you see?
you should never quit on a friend, son.
of course you would.
Yeah, okay. That's what I thought.
I... I don't eat cookies.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I, uh...
I can take you to Joe.
Joe?
dad? - Joe!
dad! Dad, don't come in here! - Are you all right?
Joe, Joe, I'm not going to hurt you. - Joe, I'm so sorry.
seriously, do not come in. There's a snake.
whoa.
what do I do?
Kelly... look at me.
be cool, all right?
be calm.
be still. - Whoa.
do not move. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
it can sense fear, all right?
don't move.
no, no, no! - Easy, easy.
Joe! Joe, don't be an idiot!
be calm.
that's good.
what the hell is that?
Biaggio?
Oh, God. - Oh, my living Christ.
holy shit.
Oh...
Joe, no! No, no, Joe!
fuck you, snake!
he's awake.
you're okay. - Did it get me, man?
Yeah, a little bit. Um... - Small bite.
dad, take the head and the body and bury them in two separate holes, do you understand?
the venom will attract other snakes.
okay.
dad, now! - Okay.
can you not just, like, suck it out of him?
the venom has already entered his bloodstream.
okay, we got to get him out of here.
Oh! Oh! - My God.
maybe that's good. Maybe that's good.
maybe he got it out. Maybe he got it out of his system.
dad, can you bring the car up?
Yeah, I'll just... I'll carry it, I guess, or fly it over the forest.
no, I can't bring the car up here!
your jokes are not funny right now!
guys, stop yelling! This isn't helping anything!
he's getting worse. - Oh, my God, he's really letting it go.
you're pissing yourself, kid. - Guys, he is burning up.
we need to get him out of here.
you up for a little walk, buddy?
all right, look, you two, run up ahead, pull the car up as close as you can to the mouth of the woods.
you know how to put it in gear? - Fuck, yeah.
watch your mouth. Good, good. Let's go! Let's go! Move!
come here.
did you have asparagus?
hang on.
uh... try these.
so...
you honestly believe that you saw Heaven?
Yes.
there were many demons.
but I'm better now.
stronger.
if I had to do it over, I'd get bitten again.
I know you would, Biaggio.
you're a good friend.
remember when I said, "If I had to do it over, I'd get bitten again"?
you... you just said that.
I was wrong.
I would never do that again.
Joe.
I...
I, um, got this for you from the gift shop.
uh, it has an eagle on it, the snake's natural enemy.
you're miles above the rest.
I... I guess they didn't have one that said, uh, "You saved me from an agonizing death by rapid blood oxygenation.
uh, they did; just no envelopes.
look, Joe, just...
just because we're not dating doesn't mean that I don't care about you at all.
we didn't even know if you were dead or not.
you know?
I would give you a hug or something, but I don't know, maybe you don't want to be anywhere near me.
no.
a hug can work.
Hey.
is he okay?
uh, yeah.
Biaggio is in there.
okay.
okay.
see you, bro.
so, who's this Kelly?
is that Patrick's girlfriend?
Yep.
looking that way.
she looks like a real heartbreaker.
Yes.
you were very good, Joe.
in the woods, before.
good?
Yeah.
you were very good.
I was really proud of you.
Thanks.
guess I'm a man now, huh?
you're getting there, bud.
no need to rush.
stroke alert.
fifth floor, building B.
room 514.
stroke alert.
so, uh...
how are things between you and Carol?
Carol?
you're referring to the spider woman I found in the gutter?
that you found in the gutter, yes.
that's the one. - The same. One and the same.
things, uh... things are actually cooled down between Carol and me.
it's baffling.
just... I can't quite pinpoint the exact moment when everything went south.
Yeah. - It's a puzzle.
sorry about that one.
it's okay.
it wouldn't have worked anyway.
she didn't...
I don't know, she...
she didn't make me nervous.
not like your mom did, anyway.
and you need that.
Mm-hmm.
I know. I know.
what's going on over there?
Patrick's just being an idiot.
you are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
sir?
at the microphone, do your work. Sir.
I am sure you will be splendid. Just take your time.
time to go.
good afternoon.
this is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from his Father; His Majesty, King George V.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
remember Sir, Three flashes;
then steady "red" means you are Live.
using the new invention of radio,
the Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
at the close of the first Season,
the heir to the throne His Royal, Highness the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast.
and today, his younger brother His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received...from his Majesty...t' ek...The King.
inhale deep into your lungs. Your Royal Highness.
relaxes your larynx, does it not?
cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
if Your Highness will be very kind as to open your hand...
it's Sterilized. Now.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Now...if I may take the liberty?
insert them into your mouth.
excuse me, Doctor. What is the purpose of this?
it is the classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
that was in ancient Greece...uh.
has it worked since?
now, if you would be so kind as to read...
a wealth of words.
fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
enunciate!
a little more concentration, Your Royal Higness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most...hmm interesting.
your highness.
insert marbles!
he can insert his own bloody marbles...!
you know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
promise me. Promise me, no more.
hello. Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs. Johnson. There you are.
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist. I like to keep things simple.
poor and content is rich and rich enough.
sorry? - Shakespeare. How are you?
how do you do?
coughing a lot.
now, this is slightly awkward. But, I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr. Johnson?
he doesn't know I'm here.
that's not a promising start.
look, my husband has seen everyone to no avail.
awefully 'fraid he's given up hope.
he hasn't seen me.
you're awfully sure of yourself.
well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
of course, he wishes to be cured.
my husband is umm...he's required to speak publicly.
perhaps he should change jobs?
he can't.
indentured servitude?
something of that nature. Yes.
well, we need to have your hubby pop by...
uh. Tuesday would be good...
he can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, we can take it from there.
doctor, forgive me.
I do not have a hubby. We don't pop.
and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
you... must come to us.
I'm Sorry, Mrs. Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
you'll have to talk over this with your husband and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
thank you very much for dropping by... Good afternoon.
and what if my husband were the Duke of York?
the Duke of York?
yes... the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson? Forgive me, Your ...?
royal Highness.
johnson was used during the Great War;
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know he was aboard.
am I...considered the enemy?
you will be, if you remain unobliging. And you have to have absolute discretion.
of course. How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
the President of society of the Speech Therapists.
Eileen Mcleod? She's a sport.
Dr. Mcleod warned me your antipodean methods were unorthodox and controversial.
I warned her... those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
but for my method to work I need trust and total equality;
here, in the safety of my consultation room.
no exceptions.
well then, in that case...
when can you start?
still sounds a bit rough, mate.
you make me drive too slowly, Dad!
did you pick mum up from bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
may I please leave this table? - How special, special?
no, you must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
thanks Dad. - And Mum.
and mom.
me too. - You meeting Jean?
no, someone else.
doctor? Doctor? Can't you help your brother with the washing...
I'm fine.
who's it, Lionel?
why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
myrtle, It's just a woman, looking to help her husband.
Oh! And I had a call.
for an audition.
one of my favorites. - Aren't they all?
it could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
they're a highly regarded group.
from Putney.
tomorrow, Chapter IV.
the flight - Mama, I don't know he can fly at all. - I can't wait.
Oh, they can fly away.
weren't they lucky!
now Papa tell a story!
could I be a penguin instead?
well, now I want a penguin story.
very quickly.
once, there were two princesses...
princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
this was because he had been turned into one by the wicket witch.
this was a...inconvenient for him.
because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms...
and penguin can't, because he has wings like herrings.
herrings don't have wings.
penguins have wings which is shaped like herrings and make matters worse...
is that she sent him to the South Pole.
which is an awfully long walk back.
if you can't fly.
so, when he reached the water, he dived in through the dept so fast...
that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
and from there, he took the 2. 30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
he swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook, mama and...Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.
now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him, guess what he turned into?
a handsome prince.
a short-tailed Albatross.
with wings so big that he could wrap them both his two girls together.
now, now. It's time for bed. Come on.
take these horses to stable.
good night. - Good night.
feed them, bath them and to bed.
will Mrs. Simpson be there?
my brother's insisting.
is he serious?
about her coming to dinner?
no. About her!
a married woman? He can't be.
she can.
by the way,
I think I found someone rather interesting.
on Harley Street. A doctor.
out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again. The matter's settled.
his approach seems rather different...
now?
now.
now is the winter of our discontent,
made glorious summer by this sun of York.
and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths;
thank you!
lovely diction. Mr...?
Logue. Lionel Logue.
well, Mr. Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines. I've played the role before.
Sydney? - Perth.
major theater town, is it?
enthusiastic.
I was well reviewed.
yes... well...Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and a little more regal.
you have to shut that one first. Put that one forth.
excellent.
where did you find this...physician?
classifieds, next to 'French model, Shepherd's Market'.
he comes highly recommended.
charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!
no receptionist. He likes to keep things simple.
the Johnson's.
you can go in now, Mr. Johnson.
Lionel says...
wait here if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.
or, it being a p-pleasant day, p-perhaps take a stroll.
was that alright...Lionel?
marvelous! Willy. You can stay and wait for your mom.
Mrs. Johnson...
Mr. Johnson, Do you come in?
he's a good lad, Willy.
he could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
my boys made those. They are good, aren't they?
please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
well. I believe when speaking with a prince,
one waits for the prince to choose a topic.
waiting for me to...commence a conversation. One can wait a rather long wait.
do you know any jokes?
timing isn't my strong suit.
cup of tea?
no thank you.
I think I'll have one.
aren't you going to start treating me, Dr. Logue?
only if you're interested in being treated.
please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel. What'll I call you?
your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
a little bit formal for here. I prefer names.
prince Albert ...Frederick Arthur George.
how about Bertie?
only my family uses that.
perfect. In here, it's better if we're equals.
if we were equals, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no one would give a damn.
please, don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
my physicians say it relaxes the throat.
they're idiots.
they've all been knighted.
makes it official then.
my castle, my rules.
thank you.
what was your earliest memory?
what on earth do you mean?
your first recollection.
I'm not here to discuss my personal matters.
Why're you here then?
because I am bloody well stammer!
you have a bit of a temper?
one of my many faults.
when did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
don't tell me! It's my stammer!
it's my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
when did yours start?
four or five.
that's typical.
so I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
do you hesitate when you think?
don't be ridiculous.
how about when you talk to yourself?
everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.
stop calling me that.
I'm not going to call you anything else.
then we shan't speak!
are you charging for this, Doctor?
a fortune.
I'll just let that brew.
so, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
of course not!
well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
what do you think was the cause?
I don't...Don't know.
I don't care! I stammer!
and no one can fix it.
I Bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
and if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
and if I win? - You don't have to answer.
one usually... wagers money.
a bob each to keep it sweet?
let's see your shilling?? - I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you. And you can pay me back next time.
who says there is a next time?
I haven't agreed to take you on, yet.
please stand. And take a look at that.
I can't...can't read this.
then you owe me a shilling, for not trying.
to be... or not to be, that...
I can't read!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
this is brilliant.
it's the latest thing from America: it's a Silvertone.
pop this on?
there's a bob in this, mate. You can go home rich!
you're playing music. - I know.
how can I hear what I'm saying?
surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing.
you're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
hopeless. Hopeless!
you were sublime.
would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
let me play it back to you.
no.
all right then, I get to ask you the question.
thank you, Doctor,
I don't feel this is for me.
thank You for your time, Bye.
sir?
the recording is free.
please keep it as a souvenir.
no.
for the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, to regain prosperity at this time of depression without self-seeking and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.
to all, to each, I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
and off air.
easy when you know how.
sir.
have a go yourself.
congratulations, Sir. - Mr. Wood.
splendid fellow.
chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
thank you. - Gentlemen.
sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye as you would any decent Englishman.
show who's in command.
Papa, I don't think I can read this.
this devilish device will change everything if you don't.
in the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
this family has been reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures.
we've become actors!
we're not a family, we're a firm.
yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
your darling brother, and future king!
the only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
he's broken off with Lady Furness.
and taken up a Mrs. Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight, no divorced person could ever be received at court.
he said, "It made him sublimely happy."
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word..." this is what he said.
I give you my word we've never had immoral relations,
stared square into his father's face... and lied!
when I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe,
Marshall Stalin the other half.
who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?
you?
with your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
have a go yourself.
with the wireless... - Get it out, boy!
one of the m-marvels of m... - Modern...
just take your time, form your words carefully.
science, I am enabled, to... - Relax!
just try it! - This Christmas Day...
to speak to all my...
do it!
lying bastard.
you're playing music. - I know.
how can I hear what I'm saying?
surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
you're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
to be, or not to be, that is the question:
whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them.
to die; to sleep; no more.
and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation...
hopeless. Hopeless!
strictly business.
no p...personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
have you got the shilling you owe me?
no, I haven't.
didn't think so.
besides, you tricked me!
physical exercises and tricks are important...
what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
is that effcient?
no, as far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
maybe just deal with that.
I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue... - Lionel.
are you...are you willing to do your part?
alright. You want mechanics?
we need to relax your jaw muscles and strengthen your tongue by repeating tongue twisters
for example, I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles because I am a thistle-sifter.
fine!
you have a flabby tummy, we need spend some times to strength in your diaphragm.
simple mechanics.
that is all we ask.
and that's about a shilling's worth.
forget about the bloody shilling!
perhaps, upon occasions, you might be requested to assist in coping with some minor event.
will that agreeable? - Of course.
Yes. And that will be the full extent of your services.
shall I see you next week?
I shall see you every day.
feel the loosening of the jaw.
good. Little bounces, bounces. Shoulders loose.
now lips.
take a nice deep breath. Expand your chest.
put your hands on your ribs.
deeper, good.
how do you feel? - Full of hot air.
isn't that what public speaking is all about?
my wife and I are glad to visit this important...
take a good deep breath, and up comes Her Royal Highness and slowly exhale, and down comes Her Royal Highness.
you alright, Bertie? - Yes.
this is actually quite good fun.
Mmm...,other. -Shorter time each time. Mmm...Mother.
Mmm...Manufactoring district. - Another deep breathe...
Jack and Jill... - Jack and Jill...
went up the hill. -went up the hill.
now just sway.
perfect.
we'll not permit us to...
loosen the shoulders. -Ding dong bell, which is in the well...who put any little ton in ten...
still short memory, Bertie, come on.
a cow. A cow. - A king. A king.
anyone who can shout vows in a open window can learn to deliver a speech.
forty... fifty!
take a deep breath, and... - It is...
let the words flow. - Knight as a bloody wack...
come on. One more time, Bertie, do it!
a sieve of sifted thistles...
father. Father. - F...Father. Father.
name of the "th," father. - Father. F...Father. Father.
Hello, Bertie. - Hello David.
how did you come out. - Not at all.
you waiting long?
Christ, it's bloody freezing.
Where've you been?
I've been busy. - So was I.
Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry. She'll recover.
father won't.
I'll drive.
old bugger's doing this on purpose. - Dying?
departing prematurely...
to complicate matters with Wallis.
for heaven's sake, David. You know how long he's been ill.
wallis explained.
she's terribly clever about these things.
whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June, 1912.
his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian, -Custos Regni... -I-I cannot...I'm confused.
in the form of council of state. - I don't understand what you are talking about...
it's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
so we may act on your behalf.
talk clearer to me, I'm afraid...
I'm so confused but...- Approved.
thank you.
give me your hand, sir.
thank you.
feeling a little better, Sir?
no. I'm not feeling any better. I feel dreadful.
been ice skating? ...Ice skating.
no, no, George.
Yes, yes, he's alright, of course.
I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately.
David, dinner?
I'm on with Wallis!
Bertie. No. No, it's not important.
I don't want to! No!
I'll phone you later. Bye.
wallis misses me terribly.
mama says you're late for dinner.
she forgets.
Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast.
how is the King? I hope he is not in pain.
no, no, sir. His Majesty is quieter now.
thank you.
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
none of this unpleasantness would be tolerated.
you know sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father both in outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest, to present it in a most favorable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear, our vigil will not be of long duration.
please continue.
we commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
long live the King.
I hope, I will make good as he has made good.
what on earth was that?
poor Wallis. Now I'm trapped!
time for a Shake, dad?
you sure?
go on.
put your thinking caps on.
bet it's the Scottish Play.
no, I bet it's Othello. It's always Othello.
are thou afeard. Be not afeard.
Caliban!
Oh! For heaven's sake, that was a lucky guess!
don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.
the isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt not.
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments will hum about mine ears;
and sometimes voices, that, if then
I had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again:
alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
and then, in dreaming, the clouds me thought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me; that when I'm awake...
when I waked, I cried to dream again.
it's such a sad thought.
my next patient must be early.
you better go, lads, I'm sorry.
won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie! They told me not to expect you.
I am sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude.
Oh no... Please come in.
I've been practising. One hour a day. In spite of everything.
what's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
do you feel like working today?
a Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death. Still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
what did you father do?
he was a brewer.
at least there was free beer.
here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact...
that my father's last words were:
bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together.
he couldn't say that to my face.
my brother.
what about him?
try singing it.
I'm sorry.
what songs do you know?
songs?
Yes, songs.
"Swanee River"?
I love that song.
happens to be my favorite.
sing me the chorus.
no. Certainly not.
always wanted to build models. Father wouldn't allow it.
he collected stamps. So we had to collect stamps.
you can finish that off. If you sing.
I'm not going to sit here, wobbling.
you can with me.
because you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
rules are rules.
I'm not crooning "Swanee River."
"Camptown Races" then.
my brother David, he said to me, doo- dah doo-dah...Continuous sound will give you flow.
does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
to tell the truth, it was a relief...
knowing I wouldn't be King.
but unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
and your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
you're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor.
Lionel See? You didn't stammer.
of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
your boy, won't mind?
no, not at all.
david and I were very close. Young bucks...You know.
did you chase the same girls?
david was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
we shared the expert ministrations of Paulette in Paris.
not at the same time of course.
did David ever tease you?
Yes, they all did. Buh-buh-buh-Bertie?
father encouraged it. "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
said that "I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me."
are you naturally right handed?
left. I was punished. Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammers.
anything other corrections?
knock knees.
metal splints were made...worn night and day.
that must have been painful.
bloody agony. Straight legs now.
who were you closest to in your family?
nannies. Not my first nanny, though. She loved David...hated me.
when we are presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd pinch me.
I'd cry and be handed back to her immediately.
then... she would...
sing it.
then she wouldn't feed me, far far away.
took my parents three years to notice.
as you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems. Still.
what about your brother Johnny?
were you close to him?
Johnny. Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and...
he was different.
died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
do you want a top-up?
please.
you know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
Australian.
I've ever really spoken to.
sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see, you know, the common man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine.
thank you.
What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
that's enough darling. - I have to keep doing this.
one hundred year old oaks...removed to improve the view!
who does she think she is!
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.
you know she calls me the Fat Scottish Cook?
you're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
you seldom cook.
I sifted seven.
shut up!!
their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
how lovely to see you both.
welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
your Majesty.
sorry we're late.
very nice to see you, Mrs. Simpson.
very nice.
hello David.
you're making some changes to the garden, I see.
Yes, I am. I am not quite finished.
don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
on the contrary, Your Royal Highness. Etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host: in this case: the King.
not a commoner. - Thank you.
what is her hold on him?
I have no idea.
apparently she has certain...skills, acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David. - Just be a sec, darling.
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
doing what?
Kinging.
Kinging is a precarious business these days.
where is the Russian Tsar? Where is Cousin Wilhelm?
you're being dreary.
is Kinging laying off eighty staff at Sandringham and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there are people marching across Europe singing the Red Flag?
stop your worrying. Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody '23?
and you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
mother's not still in the bed, is she?
that's not funny.
wallis likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
we intend to marry.
excuse me?
she's filing a petition for divorce.
good God.
can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I won't have her as my mistress.
David, the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the head of the Church.
haven't I any rights?
many privileges...
not the same thing.
your beloved common man may marry for love, why not me?
if you were the common man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!
sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
sounds like you haven't.
is that what this is all about?
brushing up. Hence, the elocution lessons?
I'm trying to t-t...
yearning for a larger audience, are we? B-b-b-Bertie?
D-don't...
younger brother trying to push older brother off throne.
pa - - pa...Positively medieval.
where have you been all this time? - Who have you been talking to?
never you mind.
Ahh. What a complicated lovely coon you are.
I try to be.
all that work, down the drain.
my own brother...
I couldn't say. I couldn't say a word to him in reply!
why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
stop trying to be so bloody clever!
what is it about David that stops you speaking?
what is it about you, that bloody well makes you want to go on about it, the whole bloody time.
vulgar but fluent. You don't stammer when you swear.
bugger off!
is that the best you can do?
well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
a public school prig can do better than that.
shit!
shit, shit, shit! Shit!
see how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
because I'm angry!
you know the f-word?
fornication?
Oh, Bertie.
fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Yes! You see! Not a hesitation!
bloody, bloody, bloody! Shit, shit,
shit! Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Tits.
dad? What's going on?
sorry. Finish your homework.
well. That's a side of you we don't get to see that often.
no. No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
let's get some air.
no Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
what's the matter? What's got you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
my brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
she's asking for a divorce and David is determined to marry her.
Mrs. Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
that's all right. Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
unthinkable.
can he do that?
absolutely not. But he's going to anyway.
all hell's broken loose.
can't they carry on privately?
if only they would.
where does that leave you?
I know my place!
I'll do anything...
in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
is it that serious?
your place may be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
if you had to you could outshine David...
don't talk about this!
that's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King. You could do it!
that is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realise you need not be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you so afraid of?
your poisonous words!
why'd you come to me?
you are not some middle class bugger, who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...
don't instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a ... King...
the brother of a king.
you're the disappointing son of a brewer!
a jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
you're nobody.
these sessions are over!
it's not because she's an American. That is the least of it.
it's because she is a soon to be a twice divorced American, and the King as head of The Church of England...
can not marry a divorced woman.
and Sir, I apologize for the nature of this, according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive. Rights to Mrs. Simpson's... favours and affections, sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
in addition, it is also rumoured...
hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
should your brother continue to ignore the advice of His Government, He must abdicate.
otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a government?
does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
what's the matter, love?
I'm just having trouble with a patient.
that isn't like you. Why?
he's scared... He is afraid with his own shadow.
isn't that why they come to you?
this fellow could be really somebody great, and he's fighting me.
perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.
perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
apologize, do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait. Or I could come back later.
as I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
thank you.
the parliament will not support their marriage.
but there were other reasons for concern, Sir.
he was careless with state papers.
he lacked commitment and resolve.
there were those that worried where he would stand when war comes with Germany.
we're not coming to that?
indeed we are, Sir.
prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
war with Germany will come, and we will need a King behind whom we can all stand united.
I fear...my brother is not of sound mind, at this time.
have you thought what you will call yourself?
certainly not Albert, Sir. Too Germanic.
what about George?
after your father? George the sixth.
it has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think?
David! Thank God.
you look exhausted!
how are you bearing up?
Bertie. The decision's been made.
I am going.
I cannot accept that.
you are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
my mind's made up. I'm... sorry.
that's a terrible thing to hear.
David, nobody wants that. I least of all.
at long last I am able to say, a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
a few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
this I do with all my heart.
you all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
but you must believe me, when I tell you.
I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties.
as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love...
and I want you to know.
this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country...
and with his fine qualities...
will be able to take my place forth with without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire.
I meet you at today in circumstances which are I'm sure you will love it.
thank you darling, saddles, Margret.
yes mom. - Good boy.
mama, here is the Wilson saddle. - Thank you.
don't worry, we'll get you food in a minute.
mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
curtsey.
your Majesty.
how was it?
I'm trying to familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
a dispatch from Mr. Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
the Christmas broadcast.
I think that might be a mistake.
don't worry about that.
plans for the Coronation.
I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer.
it's the only thing I know.
I'm not here. I'm not a King.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Please...please.
dear, dear man...
you know... I refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea royal life.
couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
but then I thought...
he stammers so beautifully...
they'll leave us alone.
waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
this is home. Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
it's lovely.
absolutely lovely.
may I sit down?
Yes, of course.
would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes. I'll help myself.
off you go...
or must I knock your heads together?
here's your shilling,
I understand...
what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
now here I am.
is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
every stammer always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
if I fail in my duty...
david could come back.
I've seen the placards.
God save Our King!?
they don't mean me.
every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.
my predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
what a bloody mess!
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
like your Dad used to do?
precisely.
he's not here anymore.
Yes, he is. He's on that shilling I gave you.
easy enough to give away.
you don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
or your brother.
you don't need to be afraid of the things as you were afraid of when you were five.
you're very much your own man, Bertie.
am I?
your face is next, mate.
Lionel?
myrtle!
is it alright? - Yes.
Bertie, come here.
are you alright, Logue? - Yes.
shall we go through? - Trust me. It's important.
what is it?
your... Your... - It's your Majesty? The first time.
after that, it's Ma'am, As in Ham, not Malm as in Palm.
I haven't told her about us.
sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
your Majesty, you may call me Mrs. Logue, Ma'am.
very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.
Logue, we can't stand here all day.
Yes, we can. Look, I need to wait for the right moment.
Logue, you're being a coward!
you're damn right.
get out there, man!
Hello, Myrtle darling!
you're early. I believe you two have met!
but I didn't think, you know...
king George the Sixth.
it's very nice to meet you.
will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
we would love to, such a treat, but alas...
a previous engagement. What a pity.
archbishop. - Welcome, Your Majesty.
what a glorious transformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations.
and now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
we begin of course at the West door, then into the nave.
I see you all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I also have to permit the newsreel cameras.
the product of which I shall personally edit.
without momentary hesitation.
this is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
he's my speech therapist.
your Grace. - Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance,
I should've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue...
will be attending the Coronation.
well of course I shall speak with the Dean, but it was extremely difficult.
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
but members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
that is why it's suitable.
and now, if you don't mind Your Grace, we need the premises.
my dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
the Church must prepare his Majesty.
my preparations are equalized in important
with complete privacy, if you don't mind.
those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I shall place the Abbey at Your majesty's disposal this evening. Your Majesty.
look, he comes again.
I can't believe I'm walking on tombs of Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
everything alright? Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.
call me Lionel.
true, you... never...called yourself "Doctor."
I did that... for you.
no training, no...diploma, no...qualifications.
just a...great deal of nerve.
the star chamber inquisition, is this?
you asked trust and...total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
my son Laurie said dad, do you think you could help that poor man??
what, as a failed actor!?
it's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit.
well, I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
when the Great War came, all our Soldiers were returning straight from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak somebody said, Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
do you think you can possibly help these poor buggers?
I did muscle therapy exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
these poor young blokes had cried out in fear, no-one was listening to them.
my job was to give them faith in their own voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
that must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
you give a very noble account of yourself.
make inquiries. It's all true.
inquiries have been made!
you have no idea who I have breathing down my neck?
I vouched for you and you have no... credentials.
but lots of success!
I can't show you certificate.
there was no training then.
everything I know I know from experience, and that war... was some experience.
my plaque says, "L Logue, Speech Defects."
no Dr. there are no letters after my name.
lock me in the Tower.
I would if I could!
on what charge? - Fraud!
with war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
you destroyed the happiness of my family.
all for the sake of ensnaring a star patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
it'll be like mad... King George the Third, there'll be mad King George the stammer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing? Get up! You can't sit there! Get up!
why not? It's a chair.
no, that's not a chair, that is...that is...
that is Saint Edward's Chair!
people have carved their names on it.
that chair is the seat on which every King and Queen.
it's held in a place by a large rock!
that's the Stone of Scone yard, - you are trivializing everything. - You believe such bollocks.
you're trivialising everything!
I don't care how many royal...
listen to me. Listen to me! - arse have sat in this chair.
listen to me...! - Listen to you?! By what right?
by the divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!
no, you're not! You told me so yourself.
you said you didn't want it.
why should I waste my time listening to you?
because I have a right to be heard!
heard as what?! - I HAVE A VOICE!!!
Yes, you do.
you have such a perservance.
Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
and you'll make a bloody good king.
what on earth's going on, - Sir? - It's quite alright, Archbishop.
Mr. Logue, you must know that I found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
hence, your services will no longer be required.
I'm sorry?
your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
and you didn't consult, but you've just been advised.
now I advise you:
in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
my concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbshop, but it's my head!
your humble servant.
thank you Bertie.
shall we rehearse? Come on upon your purge.
now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you'll be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said onto me."
actually you won't be that glad, because they sing it for a very long time.
then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs toward you and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take the oath?"
"I am willing." - Course you are!
I'm gonna see what it sounds like in the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
"will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?"
"I solemnly promise so do so."
Louder! I can't hear you up the back.
"I solemnly promise so do so."
very good!
"will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?"
"I will." "I WILL!"
then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith, goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish. To which you finally say...
the things which I have...herebefore promised,
I will perform and keep.
so help me God.
and that's all you'll say. Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath and you're King.
easy.
you nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.
try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
archbishop, we're missing Papa.
very good, very good. Archbishop.
well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
you could switch that machine off now.
no, wait, keep going.
do have a seat, Archbishop.
Papa? Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
it's a matter of principal. I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler, but the world may be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along.
this was always Hitler's intention.
I am many very sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid. Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
this morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
at last, Sir, here is your speech. You are on air at six.
I've timed it at just under nine minutes.
the wording is fully approved.
the Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
get Logue here immediately.
there's the barrage balloons. - Yes.
they got them up there quickly.
should we pull over and find shelter?
no, go straight on. We'll be alright - Yes. Sir? - Lionel Logue.
major Hartley's expecting me. This is my son Laury.
thank you, Laurie. - Good luck, Dad.
the King's Speech. - Thank you, Sir.
we have about forty minutes until the broadcast.
thank you very much. Thank you.
there may be dark days ahead, and...
try again.
there may be dark days ahead, and...
turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, God save the King.
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
and Lionel, if I am to be King... where is my power?
can I...Can I form a Government?
can I...Can I levy a tax or declare a war? No!
yet I am the seat of all authority. Why?
because the Nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them.
yet I cannot speak!
let's take it all again from the top. "In this grave hour,
in this grave hour," fuck, fuck, fuck, perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger, shit, shit.
I send to every household of my...
you see "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
bounce onto it "A-peoples," not "People."
"A-peoples," household of my peoples both at home and overseas...
beaut.
"this message, doo-dah," "spoken with the same depth of feeling," doo-dah-dey, ..."for each one of you as if I were able to" shit, fuck, bugger, cross your threshold and speak to you.
in your head, now: I have a right to be bloody well heard!?
bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
now Waltz. Move! Get continuous movement.
for the second time in the lives of most of us, we are at...
we are...? Take a pause. - Lionel, I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it.
have a look at the last paragraph. - Bertie, it's time.
archbishop. - Your Majesty.
a great moment, Sir.
prime Minister. - Your Majesty.
nice to see you again, so soon.
good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
or the wretched dogs.
Congratulations. First Lord of the Admiralty. - Your Majesty.
the long walk.
good luck, Sir.
I too dread this apparatus.
had a speech impediment myself, you know.
I didn't. - Family secret. Tongue-tied.
an operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
thank you, Mr. Churchill. - Sir.
darling.
how long, Logue? - Just under three minutes, Sir.
Mr. Wood. - Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr. Wood.
you'll be decorated, Logue. - I made it cosy.
some fresh air.
there you are, Darling.
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
one minute, Sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
forty seconds, Sir.
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
knighthood?
twenty seconds.
forget everything else and just say it to me.
say it to me, as a friend.
in this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.
for the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... at war.
over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
but it has been in vain.
we have been forced into a conflict.
for we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.
for the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
it is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial.
the task will be hard.
there may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
but we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
if one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help, we shall prevail.
very good, Bertie.
you still stammered on the "w"?
had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
congratulations, Your Majesty. A true broadcaster.
thank you, Mr. Wood.
congratulations, Your Majesty.
congratulations, Your Majesty. - Thank you.
ready.
good? - Perfect.
your first war time speech. Congratulations.
expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
thank you, Logue.
well done, my friend.
thank you, Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
thank you, Lionel.
Onwards?
congratulations, Sir.
almost did it better than myself, Sir.
your Majesty, I'm speechless.
congratulations, Sir.
gentlemen.
congratulations, Your Majesty.
so how was Papa, Elizabeth?
halting at first, but you got much better, Papa.
bless you.
and how about you, Margaret? - You were just splendid, Papa.

is that what you want, sister?
I'm a formal Homosexual, without Jesus.
have faith...
this used to be as hard for me...
as it is for you...
until I was saved.

Jesus hates the sin between two men much more than that between two women.
it's better than Hell's fire...
I promise you.
I hope you back that up on your hard drive.
where the fuck were you?
I was hanging out at the beach.
but I was just...I was sleeping in my truck you know...
try to figure out what I am doing here in L. A.

I... I don't know who I am anymore, Jenny - You know what?
nobody knows who they are.
you know, that's what life is about.
you walk through life and you try to figure it out and you probably won't figure it out.
it seems like you know who you are.
absolutely...
I'm like... I'm... I'm the picture of togetherness and sanity.
you know... I... I thought I was suppose to be a writer and I'm this fucking loser that get even get a publisher to call them back about stupid manuscript

I don't even have time to pump now.

the evolution of the little black dress.
sounds like a blue provoke.
well, I was thinking... It'll... It will be a nice change to do a piece on fashion.
you know.
and I wouldn't even be tempted to bring up Dana, coz...
she's... has... the worst fashion sense ever.
she really does
she's the worst dresser, I mean before I met her she used to wear pads on her shoulders.
yeah...
um, I could to that or I could a piece on a...
the evolution on the pants suit, I have...
what does that have to do with the chart?
see.
none of these Ideas have anything at all to do with the chart.
my last idea, what do you think of my last idea.
I don't get it.
OK... a... if you give a pig a pancake
it's my earth daughter Angelica favorite picture book but...
it... it's all about interconnectivity because if you do give a pig a pancake and she wants syrup to go with it um... leads her to the bath.
you know coz she is sticky.
and that leads her to bubbles which...
and then the rubber ducky and um...
a trip to the farm.
anyway, if you see what's added it's kinda of a...
I mean I'll have a lot of more ideas tomorrow so... and I...
we're gonna nail this thing.
it's gonna be fine.
give a pig a fuckin' pancake.
I'm doing a little party at my place tonight.
yeah?
you should come.
Oh that's cool.
I don't know.
with just a few friends you know.
people like us.
some people who've...
changed their bodies to match up with their brains.
and if you've changed that brain too much up to their bodies.
you should bring Jenny and come along.
I'm not really sure I know what you're talking about.
don't worry awesome.
we're good people.
you'll have fun.
well, Julia said you will try to get me in to see the senators before the hearing.
Angus what are you doing here?
well, if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, but I mean worth to try.
come here, give mummy a kiss.
OK, great, thanks, Irus.
what's Angus doing here?
I called him because I knew that you were going out tonight.
why are you packing?
I'm going to Washington.
what?
Julia was supposed to testify at the senate hearing.
but she hurt her back...
surfing.
can you have at least called me?
I tried to get to hold you all day.
this is the third night in a row she's been babysat.
I thought, we weren't gonna to this to her.
you know I mean, is there any way that you can...
reschedule your dinner?
it's not a dinner, it's a screening of a documentary, that Helena and I are interesting in financing.
can you at least go in the morning?
it's a senate hearing, Tina.
I don't think that we reschedule because we promise not do a babysitter three nights in a row.
when I took this job...
you told me that you will take care of things at home you said that you'd be more than happy to do all the things for me that I did for you when you worked to the CAC.
yeah... and I am.
I mean do you even know what's going on, Tina?
I mean we have to fight to preserve government support for the art.
pbs is up for grabs for Christ Sake.
and when I'm working I like to know that my daughter is at home with her mother,
otherwise I can't do it, Bette.
then don't!
really don't!
are you gonna be paid for this?
I'm sorry.
I have to catch that red eye tonight.
trying to meet with Barbara Grisham tomorrow before the hearing.
senator Grisham?
the dycke from Massachusetts?
I don't think she's a dycke she is famously married to some software billionaire.
Oh... right, and?
yeah and... I think is a little juvenile that lesbians assume that every strong outspoken women is automatically a dick.
OK, whatever...
damn, I think she's hot.
yeah used to now I think she's just power-hungry.
yeah that's what make so hot don't you remember when she tore Clinton a new asshole over the defence of marriage act?
she and Carey were the only power-democrats who stood by us.
I wish you would come with me.
Yeah, I do too.
God, that's so cool!
I love that stuff.
I can't
I've got so much work to do I'm...
I'm in over my head I...
I gotta be at the screening in 20 minutes I...
I love this job.
I'll miss you.
do you realize this is the first time you've spent a night away from Angelica?
ever.
I'll miss you.
honey don't do this, it's not your mess.
Oh you know what...
someone's got to do it and the person who made this mess clearly has no intention of doing it.
this is disgusting.
I think you should DJ Russel Simmons' party.

OK!
Oh... Oh wait.

may be we should think about...
increasing your budget.

I've served you dinner with lemon flavoured Pellegrino.
look I know you... walked out on your son when he was a baby.
I know that he...
grew up and turned into someone you don't particularly care for, and that feels you with sadness.
I know you have a hit record in 1992, and then...
lost yourself in a damn spiral of men a booz.
and now you have a business, ten new songs and a couple of covers that you wanna record to a CD, that you're gonna put out yourself.
and a beautiful niece who squeezes every time you walk in the room.

thank you.
thanks for the help, guys.
Hey, Carmen that looks really good on you.

she's burned to can't make it tonight.

fuck, here take, hey Carm...
Dana's game is on.

Oh, can you hang on?
Hey, she's really worked on that one

Oh, come on, Dana.
what? she is playing?
wow... I've never seen her play.
come on, Dana, you can do it.
wow... she did it! Ha ha... - It's the game for Dana Farebanks.
she did it.
Oh she's playing well. Isn't she playing well?
I can't believe Irwin isn't here to see this.
where is everybody? I'm here to help.
al we're over here.
Dana's serving her next point, come here!
guys this place is so... - Would you just shut up...
great tensed moment, the crowd is completely soundless
moment please!
fuck it's like she's a headache.
come on, Dana, get up, let's go!
Oh my god, is she all right?
no no no no, she's fine.
she... she just lost her footing a bit, that's all.
no, she is not that strong, she's pushing herself way too hard.
you obviously don't know her very well, she is strong as an ox.
time violation warning, Miss Farebanks.
people ask for this time delay
which would be just tragic...
amazing serve once again... For Dana Farebanks.
exactly, and she needs what she did wherever she finds it.
come on, Dana, you can do it, come on.
game, set, and match, Miss Farebanks.
Oh my god! look at this.
there you are, Ladies and Gentlemen
Dana Farebanks is the Mercedes-Benz Challenge Champion.
and absolutely brilliant performance in the final from a Dana Farebanks.
um... I'm sorry, uh...
in conclusion, I ask you to remember that looking at art...
is an act of choice and that those who don't want to need not to look...
thank you for your time.
miss Lord, Miss Porter whatever your name is...
is this something you want your child to have the option of seeing?
senator, you're taking a piece out of context.
it's to show about political art, and as such it presents many points of view.
try telling that to the boys and girls who are risking their lives in Iraq.
this is un-American filth.
senator what do you think you're doing?
Un-American...
not is un-American, is what you just did, you wanna be ashamed of yourself.
you know what you are?
you're just the latest reigning vigilante self-appointed culture watchdogs of the moment.
devoting countless hours and enviable resources to this bogus mission of stifling creative expression in the name of patriotism.
miss Porter...
and you know what it is senator?
it's a distraction!
it is a wanton distraction. Because let's just be forthright and honest about what is truly unpatriotic.
abject poverty is unpatriotic
the failure of our education system is unpatriotic.
lies told by presidents as justification for war...
miss Porter... - ...is unpatriotic.
it is unpatriotic that elected lawmakers fail to acknowledge, let alone address, real desperation.
the committee is reset until further notice.
it's rather fiery
do you join me in a cocktail party tonight?
I've to get back to L. A.
you'll meet people who could swing the vote for you.
it's a limited offer.
and I won't to make it to just anybody.
do not talk about Dana, do not even bring up anything that grabs with Dana.
do not...
talk about Dana! Ok!
hello welcome back!
that was... "All Fired Up" by the Tralalas.
and...
today...
I'm sure in a...
the world of connectivity thought, I will come up with something really meaningful, really entertaining.
I don't really know what to talk about if I can't talk about Dana.
wait a minute, my producer is trying to tell me something.
what Ruth, What do you try to tell me?
something about a Dick?
head?
a dickhead?
a dickhead!
OK... a dickhead.
a dickhead... um...
speaking a dickheads!
what about George Bush... he's a total dickhead.
when what about is dick?
you know I mean... I... think that's really... that... the...
question we need to put to the Democrats, why are we not talking George Bush's penis?
you know with all the times that the Republican talked about Bill Clinton's penis.
you know, we knew its... its shape, we knew its size...
we knew who was friend with..., we... we knew it had enemies.
bill Clinton's penis had to bend in a... You know, what about Tobia?
is there a bent in the Bush Administration?
baby I got us a Pimp ride.
seriously check it out, the seats in the back the go all the way down.
and then the sky light...
panoramic sun-roof or whatever, it's like you can see the entire sky.
an it is suppose to be super smooth to drive.
baby I have never been in a car this nice and I don't any give a shit about cars.
Wouou... just let's check the sound system.
Yeah! - A wink in a presidential wank...
you know... I... I think as Americans...
uh... as Americans, we need to take a long
that was Alice, I wanna hear what she is saying.
may be if we knew more about George W's weapon of mass-destruction you know...
we... we could figure how to blow him out of office.
OK? so... so come on...
are you... Nascent mock makers and you so call journalists, let's go... let's...
I say it's time to put the presidential privates...
in public.
OK I am Alice Piezacki and this was the chart...
I think Alice has lost her mind!
well, you definitely have the Senator from Connecticut vote.
you charmed her! - I don't know
should I give you a lift to your Hotel?
I don't know where else.
my place!
I do have a rather good collection.
abstract expressionists.
Oh... very good you do your homework.
thought about running for office?
well, I would... I would really love to see your collection Senator but do have to get...
Oh please, please, please Barbara.
do you always get people to do what you want them to?
then we should put you to bed.
no, I'm fine.
no, baby, you don't look fine, you look... you look really tired.
I am really tired I played my ass off today!
I know what you did...
look, Lara, you're over reacting, really!
OK?
I'm going for a little biopsy on Tuesday, we'll find out that if there's anything to worry about, but...
right now, in this minute...
I'm huge fucking tennis star.
yes you are!
yes I am!
I'm just not comfortable with those girls.
why don't you give another try?
Why?
because those people are my friends.
your friends weren't really friendly to me.
what?
I just... I feel like...
I just don't really fit in you know.
I just... they're so cool.
I don't know sophisticated.
I think that no thinking you're cool it's fucking cool.
where did you get that suit?
wonder woman, I can't believe it!
Oh you were fantastic.
thank you. - Absolutely fantastic.
thank you.
Dana sorry, that was absolutely brilliant.
thank you.
I can't wait to see you in Wimbledon.
thank you.
Congratulations.
thank you.
Hey, congratulations.
Hey, Thanks, Thanks.
and, that volley in the second set was like so awesome.
that was when I psyched her out, nobody else notices that.
yeah...
go... awesome you look, you look good.
hey thanks.
you're welcome.
Congratulations!
thanks Al.
um... Drinks...
it was like the best game you've played in a...in a long time.
you watched it?
yeah I watched it.
I'm really proud of you.
Thanks.
congratulations to you to.
thank you.
it was a great kiss.
OK... I'm gonna...
OK.
I can... I can really only stay for one Senator...
and I just opened a fabulous bottle of Scotch.
barbara, I can...
really only stay for one drink, I have a very early flight.
but I'm really glad I got to see... your... incredible collection.
let me...
ask you something.
why did you get fired from the CAC?
is it because you're a lesbian?
what? did you google me or something?
this afternoon...
after your pyrotechnics.
no I don't think the pyrotechnics were mine, I think senator Horsey...
who is a ridiculous grand-stander...
and you made him look like a fool.
I loved it.
well, then...
if you googled me then, you know that I have a partner named Tina...
and a 6 months old daughter.
is Tina...
as intense as you are?
is your husband as fluid as you are?
my husband and I have an arrangement.
it works out well.
for both of us.
come to bed with me.
I can't.
that does not sound like a Bette Porter statement.
Tina and I don't have an arrangement.
excuse me... just for a minute.
Oh you made it!
I wouldn't have missed it man.
it's amazing.
Oh so glad you're here.
I want you to do my hair.
I will do your hair. Where's the baby?
she's at home.
and what about Bette, where is she?
uh... she is in...
what... guess who...
Hey, how are ya? What I can't here you - Baby you can... - just go in there.
yeah... really?
have you seen Moira?
she looks amazing.
I know she looks like a hot guy.
I like it.
how are you? - Good.
have you um... Have you seen Carmen?
I think, she is at like some fat ass Russel Simmons Party - Yeah.
I don't know.
don't you think it's weird she is not here?
I think it sucks.
I'm sorry but why are you telling me this right know?
because Tina we have an agreement with one another.
so you wanna have sex with her?
and she is in another room and you're asking my permission?
I'm not asking your permission Ti...
I don't know...
well, you'd better hurry...
coz I don't think Senator Grisham is gonna wait around for you for very long.
so it would be fine with you if I just went back in the living room and fuck her on her 50 000$ carpet?
if that's what you wanna do Bette.
that's not what I wanna do Tina.
I just...
I just want you to care.
do you?
uh... are you all right in there?
have gotta go.
thank you. - if you need some encouragement.
I'm sorry.
I really don't need any encouragement.
you... you are an exquisite woman.
and the only thing that I want more that you right now...
is for my girlfriend to want me like you do.
she obviously doesn't know what she is missing.
that was just not meant to be.
it'd have been good though'...
I'm sure it would.
what are you doing?
you're supposed to be with Russel Simmons. - Hi!
I know surprise!
she is with Russel Simmons.
Oh! Actually I'm with her. Hi!
how are you doing I'm Russel.
I'm Shayne.
glad to meet you. This is Samora, my sister - Hi how are you doing?
you know what? Your girl, she is very talented.
yeah she's not so bad.
but I can also say that she has a priority straight because even know I hired her...
she is for you!
yes
that's true?
Yeah.
well, straight, I don't...
guess what? - What?
I have a surprise for you.
I worked on this mix
all week for you.
just for you.
go play it for her! - I wanna hear it - yeah? - Could you play yeah...!
Yeah, ok, all right!
you gonna love it!
Helena PEABODY.
sit TIGHT, ALL RIGHT, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU OUT.
how? - LOOK, I CAN'T REALLY TALK RIGHT NOW.
I JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.
what ARE YOU DOING HOME?
so ARE YOU SEEING ANYONE?
you WANT TO KNOW IF I'M GETTING LAID?
is THAT OFF LIMITS, TOO?
you DO NEED TO STOP HANGING OUT WITH BETTE SO MUCH, THOUGH.
Yeah, ESPECIALLY SINCE JODI'S COMING BACK.
I DON'T WHAT TO DO.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.
I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE DOWN.
play THE FIELD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I'M GOING TO TELL JOYCE.
but YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE WITH ME.
so I TAKE IT YOU DON'T WANT TO FILE A
no, I DON'T WANT TO FILE A REPORT.
I REWROTE THE SCRIPT WHILE I WAS IN TULUM,
and THAT'S WHERE I...
I JUST RAN INTO MONSIEUR. - WHO?
this HEDGE FUND BILLIONAIRE WHO'S FINANCING OUR NEXT THREE PROJECTS.
Jenny HAS A VERY SPECIAL INSIGHT INTO THIS WORLD.
she's THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD POSSIBLY DIRECT THE PICTURE.
directing? "LEZ GIRLS"?
more LESBIAN SEX. I WANT MORE OF IT.
you're THE ONES WHO TOLD ME
lesbians ARE ALWAYS SLEEPING WITH THEIR FRIENDS.
so LET'S SEE IT.
see THEM HOOK UP.
for EXAMPLE,
page 31, SCENE 43.
I THINK WE'RE MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY HERE.
I THINK BEV AND THIS MAKEUP ARTIST SHOULD TOTALLY HOOK UP.
that WOULD NEVER HAPPEN!
think ABOUT IT.
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE
doesn't MEAN IT CAN'T HAPPEN IN THE MOVIES--IT'S HOLLYWOOD.
we CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL WE WANT.
you SEEM TO BE FORGETTING THAT BEV AND NINA ARE TOGETHER.
she CHEATS WITH THE PLUMBER!
I LIKE THE IDEA OF BEV AS THE SERIAL CHEATER.
it UNDERMINES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HER AFFAIR WITH THE PLUMBER.
now, THIS MIGHT BE CRAZY, BUT WHAT ABOUT NINA AND SHAUN?
No! NO.
nobody EVER WANTS TO SEE NINA HAVING SEX.
no ONE WILL EVER GO TO THE FILM.
it's NOT ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE.
it's ABOUT THE FACT THAT NINA IS TOO LOYAL TO CHEAT.
it GOES AGAINST HER NATURE.
okay, I LIKE THE IDEA OF BEV AS THE CHEATER.
I DON'T SEE HER WITH SHAUN.
what ABOUT BEV AND HELEN?
now, THAT'S HOT.
I LIKE THAT. - THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.
they're TOO MUCH ALIKE.
okay, BUT THEY'RE NOT HAVING A RELATIONSHIP, TINA.
they're JUST FUCKING.
I DON'T BUY IT.
well, NOBODY CARES WHAT YOU BUY, OKAY?
Yeah, I KNOW HE'S FINANCING YOUR MOVIE, JENNY.
I WOULD LOVE TO.
no, I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK ON THE PHO.
all RIGHT, WELL, LET'S SEE HOW TODAY GOES,
and I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL, OR YOU ASK HIM.
Hi. I'M SHANE.
Oh. OF COURSE. WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.
come ON IN. -THANK YOU.
thanks FOR COMING ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.
sure.
Madison's STYLIST HAD TO F BACK EAST FOR SOME FAMILY EMERGENCY.
Oh, I'M GLAD JENNY CALLED ME.
well, MY HUSBAND, WILLIAM,
is SPENDING A FORTUNE ON HER MOVIE.
you, UH...
you've GOT A REALLY NICE PLACE.
I'm GLAD YOU LIKE IT.
I DO.
this WAY.
how MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU TO STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE?
and SIT UP STRAIGHT. SHANE'S HERE TO DO YOUR HAIR.
Shane, THIS IS MADISON, THE BRIDE.
Congratulations. HI.
Hi, SHANE.
and THAT'S ABIGAIL, HER SISTER, MAID OF HONOR.
Hi, AND GINA, ONE OF THE BRIDESMAIDS.
how YOU DOING?
the PHOTOGRAPHER'S GOING TO BE HERE IN TWO AND A HALF HOURS. I HOPE THAT'S ENOUGH TIME.
Oh, NO, NO, NO. THAT'LL BE PLENTY.
Oh, GREAT,
because I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO DO ME WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED WITH THEM.
no PROBLEM.
who WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST?
Thanks.
Hey, YOU THINK TINA'S ON A DATE?
kind OF LOOKS LIKE IT, DOESN'T IT?
we TOOK HER TO THESE PRESCHOOL INTERVIEWS LAST WEEK.
she WAS SO IMPRESSIVE.
it AMAZES ME HOW SMART SHE IS.
and SHE'S REALLY STARTING TO SHOW SOME ARTISTIC TALENT,
which MAKES BETTE REALLY HAPPY.
is BETTE AN ARTIST?
Oh, NO, NO,
but SHE'S THE DEAN OF CU'S SCHOOL OF THE ARTS,
and BEFORE, SHE WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CAC,
and BEFORE THAT, SHE WAS A GALLERY OWNER.
so ART IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO HER.
my GOD, THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
it's HER LIFE.
when WE WERE LOOKING FOR DONORS,
she INSISTED THAT HE BE AN ARTIST, AND NOT JUST ANY ARTIST.
he HAD TO HAVE MADE THE WHITNEY BIENNIAL.
it's VERY TYPICAL BETTE.
she SOUNDS NEUROTIC.
Oh, I MEAN, NOT IN A BAD WAY.
anyway, SHE REALLY WANTS ANGIE TO BE AN ARTIST.
don't YOU THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
she SHOULD LET ANGIE DECIDE FOR HERSELF?
Oh, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
she WOULD NEVER.
I MEAN, WE WOULD...
never FORCE HER TO BE ANYTHING THAT SHE DIDN'
you're THE ONE THAT SAID THAT MARRIE R LOSERS,
so WHY ARE YOU DOING IT?
to MAKE DADDY HAPPY.
anyway, YOU'RE JUST BITTER.
Shane, SHE CHEATED WITH A MARRIED MAN.
he SAID HE WAS GONNA LEAVE HIS WIFE.
now SHE'S BITTER.
fuck OFF, MADDY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD GET MARRIED.
I MEAN, LOOK AT OUR PARENTS. THEY'RE MISERABLE.
are YOU MARRIED, SHANE?
no.
do YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
no.
do YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
not ANYMORE.
but YOU LIKE GIRLS? -YES, I DO.
does THAT MEAN YOU'LL NEVER GET MARRIED?
gay PEOPLE AREN'T ALLOWED TO GET MARRIED, IDIOT.
Yeah, I KNOW, BUT THEY CAN STILL PRETEND.
well, I DON'T THINK IT'S FOR ME,
but I ADMIRE PEOPLE WHO DO IT.
despite WHY THEY'RE DOING IT.
you ARE SO GOOD, SHANE.
I WISH YOU COULD DO MY HAIR EVERY DAY.
I'll BET YOU DO.
shut UP, MADDY.
okay, I'M NEXT NOW.
do ME!
I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF EXPOSING HER
to ALL SORTS OF...
expressions, ART,
you KNOW, MUSIC, ALL OF THAT,
and THEN WHEN THE TIME COMES,
she CAN MAKE AN EDUCATED DECISION
about WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO.
Oh, HI. -SORRY.
that's OKAY, HI.
Denise, THIS IS, UH, THIS IS BETTE.
the FAMOUS BETTE.
famous? DID I MISS SOMETHING?
we WERE JUST
Tina's JUST TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT YOU.
all GOOD STUFF.
we WERE TALKING ABOUT ANGELICA, ACTUALLY.
she's REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
you've MET HER? -NO. TINA SHOWED ME A PICTURE.
well, WE'RE JUST HAVING LUNCH OVER THERE
if YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO JOIN US.
no. I THINK WE'LL STAY.
you KNOW WHAT? GO AHEAD. IT'S OKAY.
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE OFFICE ANYWAY.
are YOU SURE? -ABSOLUTELY.
it WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU. -YES, NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.
I'll BE RIGHT OVER.
okay.
maybe WE CAN DO THIS ANOTHER TIME.
I THINK YOU HAVE SOME THINGS FIGURE OUT.
shower TIME, LADIES.
you KNOW THERE'S STALLS IN THERE, RIGHT?
door's LOCKED.
that's WEIRD.
well, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR HANGING OUT AT THE PLANET, RIGHT?
right. -AFTER YOU.
no, AFTER YOU.
Thanks, MAN.
thank YOU.
so? HOW'D IT GO WITH DENISE?
was GREAT. YEAH?
Mm-hmm. GOOD.
I THINK WE'RE GONNA TOGETHER AGAIN.
that's GREAT, TINA.
so WHAT DOES SHE DO?
why WOULD YOU ASK THAT?
that's A HIDEOUS QUESTION.
I'm JUST CURIOUS.
she's A MORTGAGE BROKER.
wow, THAT'S SO...
you KNOW WHAT? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SHE DOES,
because SHE'S CUTE AND SHE'S SMART, RIGHT?
that's RIGHT.
you KNOW, REMBER WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT?
so IS TASHA BACK FOR GOOD?
Yeah. WHAT HAPPENED?
Oh, NOTHING HAPPENED.
I MEAN, I THINK THEY JUST
I THINK THERE'S A MILLION REASONS
why THEY CAN GET DELAYED.
you CAN ASK HER ABOUT IT TONIGHT, THOUGH.
the FOUR OF YOU ARE GOING ON A DOUBLE DATE?
I JUST PISSED NEXT TO THE CUTEST BOY ALIVE.
Really? WHO?
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T SEE HIM.
I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM SHANE. SHE SAYS YOUR BOSS'S HOUSE IS REALLY HUGE.
not AS BIGS MY BOSS'S EGO.
Shane's DOING HAIR FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S WEDDING.
wedding. I FORGO TO PICK UP MY DRESS.
I HAVE TO GO PICK UP MY DRESS.
I'm SORRY. REALLY?
have FUN. -??
okay.
you KNOW HOW SHANE'S DOING?
do YOU GUYS REALLY THINK THAT PAIGE BURNED WAX DOWN?
I DON'T THINK IT COULD BE MORE OBVIOUS.
really.
she MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY ANGRY.
well, SHE'S LUCKY
that SHANE DOESN'T WANT TO PROSECUTE.
I'm JUST WORRIED ABOUT SHANE,
because I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING'S ESCALATING.
escalating?
well...
we USED TO SAY
that EVERY TIME SHANE WALKED INTO A ROOM,
some GIRL LEFT CRYING.
but NOW...
no ONE'S EVER REALLY COMMITTED ARSON OVER SHANE BEFORE.
like, WHAT'S NEXT?
you're SO GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME,
but DO THAT!
don't STOP.
I WISH MY SISTER COULD GET MARRIED EVERY DAY.
come.
well, I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU BACK HERE SO SOON, WILLIAMS.
although I CAN'T SAY I'M SORRY.
it GOT MIGHTY LONELY AROUND HERE AFTER Y'ALL SHIPPED OUT.
well, MAYBE YOU NEED TO SIGN YOURSELF UP FOR ACTIVE DUTY, BEECH,
instead OF GETTING FAT, SITTING UP HERE BEHIND THIS DESK.
well, SOMEBODY'S GOTTA STICK AROUND HERE,
make SURE Y'ALL DON'T GO RUNNING OFF HALF COCKED.
so, WHAT'S THE DEAL, WILLIAMS?
to WHAT DO I OWE THE UNEXPECTED PRIVILEGE?
I'm SEEKING COUNSEL.
I've BEEN TOLD I'M UNDER INVESTIGATION.
do YOU KNOW THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT?
well, I HAVEN'T BEEN FORMALLY NOTIFIED.
I BELIEVE I'M BEING INVESTIGATED FOR HOMOSEXUAL CONDUCT.
well... I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
I'd LIKE TO START PREPARING MY DEFENSE.
well, I HAVEN'T BEEN DETAILED TO YOUR CASE, CAPTAIN WILLIAMS,
and AS YOU CAN SEE, I'VE GOT A VERY HEAVY WORKLOAD OF MY OWN.
look, I'M NOT TRYING TO OVERBURDEN YOU.
I NEED SOME ADVICE.
ll, MY BEST ADVICE TO YOU IS TO MIND YOUR "P"S AND "Q"S
and THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE SERVICE.
I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT.
I've DEDICATED MY LIFE TO THE MILITARY.
I'm SURE YOU HAVE,
but ALLEGATIONS LIKE THIS
are ALST IMPOSSIBLE TO DISPROVE...
mostly BECAUSE THEY END UP BEING TRUE,
and ONCE THEY'RE OUT,
the MILITARY DOESN'T WANT YOU ANYMORE.
which IS UNDERSTANDABLE, DON'T YOU THINK?
there HE IS.
beautiful BOY WITH THE CRYSTAL BLUE EYES.
he's GAY, RIGHT?
please TELL ME HE'S GAY.
what? IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM?
no. HE'S VERY NICE.
Yeah, HE'S JUST-- HE'S NOT GAY...ANYMORE.
anymore?
so HE USED TO BE GAY?
well, NOT EXACTLY.
well, NOT EXACTLY?
he USED TO BE A LESBIAN.
he's A TRANSMAN.
Oh, MY GOD, I HAD NO IDEA.
Hey, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.
Bye. LOVE YA, LOVE YA.
Hey, IT'S HOT, HOT, HOT. -THANKS, KIT.
Hey, DO YOU KNOW THAT GIRL OVER THERE?
that GIRL?
the ONE THAT'S BEEN SITTING THERE FOR THREE DAYS IN THE SAME OLD CLOTHES?
did YOU SEE WHAT SHE'S READING?
hey THERE.
Oh, HI. I'M SORRY.
do YOU WANT ME TO PAY?
no, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I JUST CAME OVER TO SEE IF YOU WANTED SOMETHING ELSE.
no, I'M GOOD, THANKS.
I CAN'T REALLY AFFORD ANYTHING ELSE, ANYWAY.
I'm SORRY, $7. 00 FOR A SLICE OF PIE,
I KNOW IT'S A LOT.
no, I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.
?? I MEAN, THE PEAR POLENTA TART.
no, I COULDN'T

Joyce, COME SIT DOWN A MINUTE.
Yeah.
what IS IT, PHYLLIS? WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
this IS HARD.
well, WHATEVER IT IS, JUST SAY IT.
you MADE A LOVELY PROPOSAL TO ME,
and I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW VERY MUCH IT MEANT TO ME
that YOU WOULD WANT TO.
to U-HAUL WITH ME?
Oh, GOD, I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU SAYING THAT.
that WAS SO CUTE.
it WAS? - IT WAS.
Phyllis, LOOK.
I KNOW YOU JUST GOT OUT OF A 30-YEAR MAIAGE,
and IF YOU NEED TO TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME,
just TAKE IT.
I'm NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
so, YOU'RE OKAY WITH ME SEEING OTHER PEOPLE?
what?
no. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
please UNDERSTAND.
no, THERE'S NO UNDERSTANDING HERE, PHYLLIS,
I'm NOT OKAY WITH THAT.
are YOU ALREADYSEEING SOMEBODY? -NO...
no, I MEAN, I WANT TO,
but...
I TOLD CAMILLA THAT I HAD TO TALK TO YOU
before WE DID ANYTHING.
my FRIEND?
Joyce, SHE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.
well, SHE'S A FRIEND OF A FRIEND,
and YOU MET HER AT THAT PARTY I THREW FOR YOU.
we BOTH FEEL REALLY BAD ABOUT THIS,
but COME ON, DON'T TAKE IT THAT WAY.
it's NOT, LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU VS. CAMILLA.
this IS FOUL PLAY.
I'm SO SORRY, JOYCE.
thank YOU.
Phyllis, YOU'RE BEING RASH.
very RASH.
I'm GOING TO LEAVE NOW AND GIVE YOU SOME TIME
to THINK ABOUT YOUR ACTIONS
so YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING YOU WILL REGRET LATER.
I WENT ON SCHOLARSHIP,
so IT'S THE ONLY SCHOOL IN ORLANDO THAT HAS BOTH A WOMEN'S STUDIES PROGRAM AND A FILM PROGRAM.
how COME YOU WANTED TO GO TO FILM SCHOOL IN ORLANDO?
if YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING.
because SHE LOVES DISNEY WORLD.
no. WELL, I JUST...
I ALSO WAS OFFERED A SCHOLARSHIP TO NYU,
which IS, OF COURSE, WHERE I WANTED TO GO,
but MY MOM
had KIND OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN AFTER MY DAD LEFT HER, SO.
I JUST STAYED TO TAK OF HER.
is YOUR MOM OKAY NOW?
um, YEAH. SHE'S BETTER, SHE'S BETTER.
we JUST-- WE HAD A TOUGH TIME.
you KNOW?
I STAYED TO TAKE CARE OF HER,
but THEN SHE STILL TOOK A LOT OF ANGER OUT ON ME.
you KNOW WHAT?
it WAS READING THIS BOOK
that GOT ME THROUGH THAT TIME.
it WAS READING SOME OF HER PARTS.
I MEAN, THIS BOOK...
saved MY LIFE.
what A NICE THING TO SAY.
isn't THAT, JENNY?
I WENT OUT AND I FOUND EVERY SINGLE THING I COULD BY JENNIFER SCHECTER.
I FOUND YOUR FIRST SHORT COLLECTION.
I READ THOSE STORIES OVER AND OVER AND OVER.
miss SCHECTER, I JUST-- I CAN'T TELL YOU
Oh. -JENNY.
okay, JENNY.
do YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE?
no. -IN WEST HOLLYWOOD?
I'm HERE BECAUSE I HEARD SOMEWHERE
that THIS CAFE WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR THE PLUTO CAFE IN "LEZ GIRLS."
I'm JUST-- I'M SO HONORED TO MEET YOU.
it's VERY NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.
Hey, JENNY, AREN'T YOU LATE FOR A WEDDING OR SOMETHING?
what TIME IS IT? IT'S 10 TO 2: 00.
that FUCKING ASSISTANT, MARISSA,
was SUPPOSED TO GET THE GIFT, AND NOW I DON'T HAVE A GIFT.
so WHAT? YOU CAN JUST GET ONE AFTER.
I MEAN, I'M SURE THEY'RE REGISTERED.
I'm SO SORRY. THIS IS MY FAULT.
can I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU?
I MEAN, I'M NOT SURE,
I DON'T KNOW,
unless YOU WANT TO GO TO GEARY'S OR WILLIAMS SONOMA, WHERE THEY'RE REGISTERED,
and MAYBE PICK UP A GIFT ON MY BEHALF
and DROP IT OFF AT THEIR WEDDING?
sure, YEAH, YEAH. DEFINITELY, OF COURSE.
I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO.
Oh, GOOD. OKAY, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.
come ON.
you CAN HELP ME PICK OUT A PERFECT PAIR OF SATIN SHOES,
maybe CARRY THAT FOR ME,
and TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE IN FLORIDA.
you WANTED THAT JOB, DIDN'T YOU?
as IF.
no, THOSE DAYS ARE GONE.
looks LIKE NOBODY WARNED HER ABOUT DROPPING THE SOAP.
it JUST SLIPPED FROM MY HAND.
it JUST SLIPPED FROM MY HAND.
you HEAR THAT, BILLY?
she's A FLUFF.
are YOU A FLUFF, PRETTY GIRL?
I'm SORRY.
maybe IF YOU COULD JUST EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THAT IS.
you KNOW, YOU'RE IN FOR A REALTREAT, GIRLFRIEND.
get AWAY FROM ME OR I'M GOING TO CALL SECURITY.
Ooh! SHE'S STRONG, TOO.
I WANT YOU TO CLICK UP. BLOOD IN.
it INVOLVES BLOOD?
you're SUCH A PRETTY GIRL.
it WOULD BE AN AWFUL SHAME IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO THAT PRETTY FACE.
let HER GO, JACKIE.
why SHOULD I?
because SHE'S WITH ME.
suit YOURSELF.
but I'D KEEP MY EYE ON HER IF I WERE YOU.
he LOOKED AT ME LIKE I HAD A FUCKING DISEASE.
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS ALREADY KNEW EACH OTHER.
we WENT THROUGH LEADERSHIP TOGETHER,
but I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS SUCH A FUCKING SOUTHERN BOY.
he HASN'T EVEN SEEN ACTION.
he'd PROBABLY SHIT HIS FUCKING PANTS IF HIS BUDDY GOT HIS SKULL BLOWN OFF
well, YOU KNOW WHAT?
the GOOD THING IS YOU KNOW WHERE HE STANDS
and NOW YOU CAN GO GET YOURSELF A LAWYER
that's NOT IN THE MILITARY, RIGHT?
I CAN'T AFFORD A CIVILIAN ATTORNEY.
let ME HELP YOU, TASH.
and I DOT WANT A CIVILIAN ATTORNEY.
Why?
because IF I HIRE A CIVILIAN ATTORNEY,
then I'M BASICALLY JUST ADMITTING
that I'M LOOKING TO GET AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE.
now, BEECH SAID THAT
it's ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEND
a DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL CASE,
because THE ALLEGATIONS ARE USUALLY TRUE.
well, THEN FORGET BEECH.
he's OBVIOUSLY A SHITTY LAWYER.
you CAN WIN THIS.
and I DON'T EVEN KNOW
why THE ARMY TRIES TO KEEP GAYS OUT OF THE MILITARY, ANYWAY.
I'm NOT FIGHTING TO ALLOW GAYS TO SERVE OPENLY IN THE MILITARY.
I'm NOT EVEN TRYING TO OVERTURN DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL.
that's NOT GONNA HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.
then WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR?
I'm FIGHTING TO STAY IN THE MILITARY.
I've WORKED MY WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS, ALICE.
so, YOU'VE WORKED YOUR WHOLE LIFE
to JUST DENY WHO YOU ARE?
I'm SORRY, TASHA.
I'm REALLY JUST TO HAVE TO
adjust MY THINKING ON THIS ONE.
I'm ON YOUR SIDE, THOUGH.
I AM.
I'm SO SORRY.
I'm SO SORRY...
that I'M LATE.
Yeah, WE WERE ALL WAITING.
Oh, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU WAIT.
nice DRESS.
Thanks, TINA.
honey? HONEY?
honey?
have YOU SEEN SHANE?
no.
I ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.
I TRY SO HARD TO PLEASE HIM, BUT HE'S NEVER PLEASED.
forgetting YOUR FATHER FOR A SECOND,
what IS IT THAT YOU WANT?
nobody's EVER ASKED ME THAT BEFORE.
well, DO YOU LOVE HIM?
of COURSE, I LOVE HIM. HE'S MY FATHER.
I DON'T MEAN YOUR FATHER.
I MEAN YOUR FIANCE.
he's SWEET,
and HE TREATS ME WELL.
good.
Madison, ARE YOU IN THERE? - JUST A SECOND.
everybody IS WAITING, SWEETHEART.
do YOU... DO YOU TWO HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON?
Thanks.
we're BOTH ADVENTUROUS.
we LOVE TO TRAVEL.
and...
we LIKE TO RIDE HORSES A LOT.
that SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE COMPATIBLE.
does HE LISTEN TO YOU?
he ALWAYS LOOKS ME RIGHT IN THE EYE.
is HE FAITHFUL?
I'm PRETTY SURE.
good.
that's MORE THAN WHAT MOST PEOPLE CAN SAY.
you DO LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
your HAIR IS STAYING PUT.
you're GOING TO BE FINE.
you REALLY ARE. YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.
what IF THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER OUT THERE?
I MEAN, BRETT'S SWEET, BUT...
he DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL
like WE'RE GONNA ROCK THE WORLD TOGETHER.
it SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
is SOMETHING THAT...
that YOU HAVE TO DO ON YOUR OWN,
and NO ONE YOU FIND IT,
but AT THE SAME TIME, FROM WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME,
it SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND BRETT
are GOING TO BE GREAT TOGETHER.
don't THROW THAT AWAY.
it's NOT THAT EASY TO FIND.
and...
wow, YOU REALLY...
remind ME OF SOMEONE I USED TO KNOW.
a LOT.
no, NO, NO, IT'S...
it's A COMPLIMENT.
well, YOU'VE ONLY GOT ONE SHOT.
you MIGHT AS WELL GO DO IT.
what DID THEY SAY?
what WERE THE ACTUAL WORDS?
Oh, I DON'T KNOW.
um, I THINK SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT "CLICKING.
did SHE TELL YOU TO CLICK UP?
Yes!
it MEANS JUST JOIN A GANG.
she JUST WANTS YOU TO JOIN A GANG.
what USE AM I GOING TO BE TO A PRISON GANG?
Really? DOES THAT MEAN THAT DUSTY IS IN A GANG, TOO?
who's DUSTY?
dusty, MY CELLMATE,
the ONE WHO I SAID STEPPED IN, WENT UP TO JACKIE AND SAID...
she SAID, "SHE'S WITH ME."
okay, GIRL, BABY GIRL,
that MEANS THAT IF JACKIE EVEN LOOK AT YOU WRONG,
she HAS TO ANSWER TO DUSTY.
girl, I HOPE DUSTY IS TOUGH ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.
Oh, SHE'S STRONG.
she's AMAZINGLY STRONG.
she DOESN'T TALK MUCH, BUT
when I FIRST MET HER,
I THOUGHT SHE WAS A HOMICIDAL MANIAC.
a HOMICIDAL MANIAC WHO SAVED YOUR BUTT.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'VE BEEN WATCHING HER.
wow, SHE'S GOT THIS
kind OF QUIET IN
she's FASCINATING, ACTUALLY.
she SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S INDEPENDENT, GIRL,
and THAT'S THE KIND OF FRIENDYOU WANT.
you KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
how DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?
I've BEEN PLACES, OKAY?
shit, HAVE I.
so SOMETIMES THEY TELL YOU WHY YOU'RE BEING DELAYED,
but THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO TELL YOU?
um, YEAH. PRETTY MUCH.
I MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE UNTIL THAT PLANE HALFWAY TO IRAQ.
she DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING, REALLY.
you CAN TRUST THEM. -DON'T.
Oh, SHIT. -WHAT?
I THOUGHT PHYLLIS ALREADY BROKE UP WITH HER.
I SO DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
they're BREAKING UP RIGHT NOW.
how DO YOU KNOW?
body LANGUAGE.
Phyllis, LISTEN, YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME.
I'm GOOD FOR YOU.
I'm RICH, I'M SMART,
I'm GREAT IN BED.
and I KNOW YOU THINK YOU WANT TO PLAY THE FIELD,
but I'M TELLING YOU,
you WILL NEVER FIND ANYONE BETTER THAN ME.
are YOU OKAY?
Mm-hmm. I'M GOOD.
do YOU SEE ANYBODY HERE YOU LIKE?
are YOU KIDDING ME?
this HAS GOT TO BE THE STRAIGHTEST WEDDING ON EARTH.
no LESBIAN'S EVER GOING TO GET LAID HERE.
Yeah, PROBABLY.
shit, I NEED A DRINK.
let's GO TO THE BAR.
are YOU OKAY? YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD.
Mm-mm. I'M FINE.
Hi. -GUESS WHAT.
Willy LOVES YOU.
he SAID THE GIRLS CAN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU DID THEM,
and I SAID, "WILLY, CAN SHANE PLEASE DO HAIR ON THE MOVIE"?
and GUESS WHAT HE SAID.
what? - "YES."
yeah?
good.
Tina, WHAT DID YOU GET THE BRIDE?
I GOT THE BRIDE FOUR ESPRESSO CUPS.
that's NICE. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
Oh, GOD!
thank GOD, YOU'RE HERE.
what DID I GET THE BRIDE?
you GOT THE BRIDE A LIMITED EDITION
kitchenaid ARTISAN STAND MIXER IN METALLIC CHROME.
nice GIFT.
it's A DREAM APPLIANCE.
I LOVE THAT.
I BROUGHT YOU SOME CAKE. ARE YOU HUNGRY?
I GUESS SO.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
I'm SORRY.
let's PUT THE GIFT ON THE TABLE.
I'll SEE YOU LATER. BYE, SHANE.
Bye, JENNY. COME ON.
who THE HELL IS THAT? I DON'T KNOW.
Jenny's DRIVING ME CRAZY.
Hi, SHANE. -HI, GINA.
do YOU WANT TO DANCE WITH ME?
you KNOW, I REALLY DON'T LIKE TO DANCE.
what, WHAT, WHAT?
my ASSHOLE BOSS, HE'S OVER THERE.
have TO TALK TO HIM.
Oh, GOD.
please DANCE WITH ME.
Jenny, YOU KNOW, I
I WANT REX TO SEE US TOGETHER.
okay, HOW ABOUT THIS?
I HAVE TO RUN TO THE BATHROOM.
that's CUTE.
and I'LL BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES, OKAY?
okay.
so JUST STAY RIGHT THERE.
just STAY PUT. I'LL COME AND FIND YOU.
okay. I'LL BE HERE.
guys!
Alice, DON'T.
what?
what IS UP WITH YOU TWO?
this IS REALLY STUPID.
we SHOULD JUST TELL THEM. THEY'RE OUR FRIENDS.
tell US WHAT?
Tasha's BEING HELD
because SHE'S BEING INVESTIGATED FOR HOMOSEXUAL CONDUCT.
yore FUCKING KIDDING ME.
and SHE HAS TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE,
so IF YOU COULD JUST LAY OFF THE PDA.
I'm SORRY-- YOU JUST-- YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.
I'm SO SORRY, TASHA. I HAD NO IDEA.
no, I'M SORRY.
be RIGHT BACK.
what ARE YOU DOING?
I TOLD YOU NOT TO TELL ANYBODY.
I KNOW. I WASN'T GOING TO, BUT I HAD TO.
you DIDN'T HAVE TO DO SHIT, ALICE.
you JUST CAN'T KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!
okay, I DON'T DESERVE THAT, ALL RIGHT?
I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.
you DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?
get WHAT? YOU WERE SITTING THERE SQUIRMING.
Alice, IT'S MY LIFE.
they're NOT JUST PEOPLE, THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.
you CAN TRUST THEM.
it's NOT THEM I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
what's THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
nothing.
I'm SORRY. NOTHING.
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS
if THEY KNOW.
because, ALICE, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT,
and I DON'T WANT TO SIT AROUND
and LISTEN TO EVERYONE'S OPINIONS ABOUT IT,
and I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T BE THEMSELVES AROUND ME.
they DON'T FEEL THAT WAY, TASH.
but, SEE, THIS WHY I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO COME OUT TONIGHT.
listen,
I'm JUST HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING
why YOU WANT TO BE PART OF AN INSTITUTION THAT HATES WHO YOU ARE.
okay? I'M STRUGGLING WITH THAT.
but I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO YOU,
and I KNOW THIS IS EVERYTHING TO YOU.
and YOU'RE EVERYTHING TO ME,
and I'M JUST TRYING TO STAND HERE BY YOU.
I KNOW.
you're RIGHT.
I'm SORRY.
I'm SORRY, TOO.
I AM.
I LIKE YOUR POSTERS.
isn't IT SAD HOW DOROTHY DANDRIDGE DIED AT THE AG
OD'd ON ANTI-DEPRESSANTS.
she KILLED HERSELF?
well, THEY SAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
you KNOW, SHE WAS TAKING ALL THESE DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS FOR A SEVERELY INJURED ANKLE,
but WHO KNOWS?
apparently, SHE WAS REALLY DEPRESSED.
it's SO SAD.
I LOVED HER IN CARMEN JONES.
me TOO.
earlier, WHEN YOU SAID I WAS WITH YOU
doesn't MEAN I WANT ANYTHING.
look WHO WE RAN INTO.
Hi. I'M SORRY, WE DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE YOUR SEATS.
it's OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
we're ACTUALLY GONNA TAKE OFF.
I'm SORRY.
it's OKAY.
can I GRAB MY PURSE?
Oh, SURE.
are YOU SURE?
Yeah, NO, I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY.
this ONE OVER HERE CAN'T WAIT TO GET BETWEEN THE SHEETS.
I TOLD HER WE NEEDED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH OTHER PEOPLE,
and, YOU KNOW, SPREAD THE LOVE.
Tasha, I AM SO SORRY. I HAD NO IDEA.
don't BE SORRY. YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
all RIGHT? IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU GUYS.
it WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Bye. -BYE.
honey, COULD YOU PLEASE GET ME ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE?
you BETCHA
help ME.
do YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN IN MY LIFE?
well, SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO BE.
I'm VERY GLAD IT'S ME.
I HAD THE MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCE TODAY.
this WOMAN CAME UP TO ME,
and SHE SAID THAT MY BOOK SAVED HER LIFE,
and I THOUGHT, "I THINK OUR MOVIE IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON PEOPLE."
I KNOW IT IS.
do YOU? -I KNOW IT IS.
that's SO SWEET, I THINK I MIGHT PUKE.
I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL
that A MAN WHO'S SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE PLUNDERING FOR HIS OWN ENRICHMENT
now WANTS TO CHANGE THE WORLD THROUGH ART.
if YOU SEE SHANE, TELL HER I LEFT.
but I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME.
I KNOW BUT I HAVA TO WORK TOMORROW.
I WORK TOO. THAT'S NOT YOUR REASON.
what's MY REASON?
my PLACE IS TOO FUNKY FOR YOU.
you WON'T WALK AROUND BAREFOOT WITHOUT SOCKS.
okay. FINE. WE'LL GO BACK TO YOUR PLACE.
ready TO GO?
Yes.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I ALREADY BROKE UP WITH HER.
do IT AGAIN, PHYLLIS.
some LESBIANS YOU HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH MORE THAN ONCE.
I JUST WANTED TO SAY GOOD NIGHT.
we're ABO ON OUR HONEYMOON.
Oh, GOOD, I'M GLAD.
well, ENJOY YOURSELF.
thank YOU.
you're WELCOME. -FOR EVERYTHING.
you're VERY WELCOME.
Rex IS OUTSIDE WITH HIS WIFE.
I WANT HIM TO SEE US TOGETHER.
Gina, GO TO THE KITCHEN AND TELL THEM
we're RUNNING OUT OF CHAMPAGNE.
pronto!
meet ME DOWNSTAIRS. I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.
what IS IT?
you're JUST GOING TO HAVE TO COME AND FIND OUT.
Hey, ARE YOU OKAY?
you're HAVING A NIGHTMARE.
you WERE HAVING A BAD DREAM.
all RIGHT?
are YOU OKAY?
you WERE DEFENDING SOMEONE, RIGHT?
or MAYBE YOU WERE SET UP.
did SOMEONE FRAME YOU?
nobody FRAMED ME.
I'm SURE WHATEVER IT WAS,
you DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL ANYONE.
I HAVEN'T KILLED ANYBODY.
you DIDN'T?
it WAS TAX FRAUD.
are YOU SHANE? WHAT?
the MRS. ASKED ME TO GIVE THIS TO YOU RIGHT AWAY.
it's THIS WAY.
follow ME.
it's INCREDIBLE THAT HE'S DECIDED TO FINANCE YOUR MOVIE.
Yes. WILLIAM IS SO GRATEFUL TO BE INVOLVED IN THE MOVIE.
he THINKS THAT IT'S GOING TO REDEEM
all THESE VULGAR THINGS THAT HE'S DONE FOR MONEY.
Yeah, IT TOTALLY WILL.
I MEAN, YOU ARE JUST SO AMAZING
for SHOWING HIM THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS.
Oh, THANK YOU.
well, I THINK HE'S A NICE GUY,
and YOU'LL GET TO KNOW HIM ONCE YOU BECE MY ASSISTANT.
what?
would YOU LIKE TO BE MY ASSISTANT?
Yes! YES!
thank YOU SO MUCH.
no, YOU DON'T
you DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH I WANT TO BE YOUR ASSISTANT.
do YOU? -YES.
Oh, YES! THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'm GOING TO WORK SO HARD FOR YOU.
you ARE NOT GOING TO BE SORRY.
Oh, MY GOD, I'M SO EXCITED.
careful OF THE DRESS
drink?
Yeah.
I THINK I'D BETTER.
thank YOU.
Yes, MA'AM?
don't BE COY WITH ME, SHANE.
I SAW THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT ME WHEN YOU FOLLOWED ME.
you DID?
Yes, I DID.
and IT MADE ME HORNY.
I'm NOT CRAZY, AM I, SHANE?
no, NO, NO, NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
good.
I'm GOING TO LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE SECRET.
there's NOT A LOT I HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED.
I CAN GO WHERE I WANT,
buy ANYTHING I WANT,
and IT'S STARTING TO WEAR A LITTLE BIT THIN.
Mrs. HALSEY, I
I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME SOMEWHERE I'VE NEVER BEEN.
I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD.
you COULD.
and YOU WILL.
what ARE YOU DOING? -NOTHING.
what ARE YOU DOING? -NOTHING.
did YOU HEAR THAT? YEAH, WHAT IS THAT?
mother! -SHANE!
get AWAY FROM HER, YOU COW!
she's MINE!
yours? SHANE, TELL THEM ABOUT US.
what?
Shane NEEDS A WOMAN
who CAN TAKE HER PLACES SHE'S NEVER BEEN BEFORE,
not SOME LITTLE TWERP
who BARELY KNOWS HOW TO TONGUE KISS.
wait TILL DADDY FINDS OUT.
daddy WILL NOT FIND OUT!
you're TOO OLD FOR HER!
Oh, MY GOD! COME BACK HERE.
wait! COME HERE!
they're CRAZY, SHANE!
excuse ME. SORRY, EXCUSE ME.
sorry, SORRY, SORRY. EXCUSE ME.
they're CRAZY, SHANE!
stop HER!
drive, DRIVE, DRIVE!
Tina JUST TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT YOU.
maybe WE CAN DO THIS ANOTHER TIME.
I THINK YOU HAVE SOME THINGS TO FIGURE OUT.
I JUST PISSED NEXT TO THE CUTEST BOY ALIVE.
he's NOT GAY. HE'S A TRANS MAN.
Oh, MY GOD, I HAD NO IDEA.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I BELIEVE I'M BEING INVESTIGATED FOR HOMOSEXUAL CONDUCT.
all EGATIONS LIKE THIS ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DISPROVE.
mostly BECAUSE THEY END UP BEING TRUE.
I WANT YOU TO CLICK UP.
she JUST WANTS YOU TO JOIN A GANG.
does THAT MEAN THAT DUSTY IS IN A GANG?
who's DUSTY?
but YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE WITH ME.
I TAKE IT YOU DON'T WANT TO FILE A REPORT. -NO.
get AWAY FROM HER, YOU COW! SHE'S MINE!
yours!
Shane, TELL THEM ABOUT US.
yo WAIT TILL DADDY FINDS OUT.
daddy WILL ?? OH, MY GOD. COME BACK HERE!
Jenni NEED YOUR CAR.
drive, WOMAN! DRIVE! DRIVE! DRIVE!
I HAD A DREAM ABOUT JENNY'S MOVIE LAST NIGHT.
it WAS WEIRD.
what WAS IT?
me, YOU, AND HELENA WERE, LIKE, CHARLIE'S ANGELS.
who WAS CHARLIE?
once UPON A TIME,
they WERE THREE LITTLE LESBIANS
who JUST HUNG OUT AT A COFFEE SHOP,
but I CHANGED ALL THAT,
and NOW THEY WORK FOR ME.
my NAME IS BEV.
good MORNING, LESBIANS.
good MORNING, BEV! GOOD MORNING,
ladies, I HAVE A NEW MISSION FOR YOU.
it INVOLVES GOING UNDERCOVER.
okay, LESBIANS, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
sure SOUNDS DANGEROUS.
are YOU SURE IT'S NOT GOING TO RUIN OUR HAIR?
I PROMISE YOU GIRLS I WON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOUR HAIR OR MAKEUP.
count ME IN...
well, OF COURSE WE'RE IN,
but ARE YOU SURE THESE GAYDAR GUNS ARE REALLY GOING TO WORK?
well, THEY BETTER WORK, BECAUSE THE TARGET'S JUST ENTERED THE ROOM.
okay, LESBIANS, GO GET 'ER.
come ON, GIRLS, GET HER.
Wow.
day THREE, SHE'S STILL GOING STRONG.
Ah, 'MORNING, LAZY ASSES.
fuck OFF, YOU FREAK.
how's IT GOING, SHANE?
I've BEEN HERE SINCE 5: 30 A. M.
gotta SAY, IT'S GOING PRETTY WELL.
and ALL OF THIS IS BECAUSE YOU'VE SWORN OFF SEX?
Yup, AND ALL THE CRAP THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.
I HEAR YOU, SISTER.
homey.
I HAVE DECLARED A MORATORIUM ON SEX
and A MORATORIUM ON DRAMA,
and A MORATORIUM ON JEALOUSY.
and A MORATORIUM ON GIRLS THROWING ROCKS THROUGH YOUR WINDOWS, -AND BURNING YOUR SHIT DOWN. -YUP.
what, SOMEONE THREW A ROCK THROUGH YOUR WINDOW?
Yeah, YEAH, IT WAS ONE OF THE BRIDESMAIDS FROM THE WEDDING.
I'm TELLING YOU, I'M FUCKING DONE.
a FEW DAYS AGO I DECIDED TO TAKE A MAJOR BREAK FROM SEX,
thereby ELIMINATING THE MAIN CAUSE OF INSANIT IN MY LIFE,
and I GOT TO TELL YOU GIRLS,
I HAVE NEVER, EVER FELT SO FREAKISHLY CLEAR-HEADED,
or HIGHLY ENERGIZED.
speaking OF FREAKISH...
look AT JENNY'S NEW ASSISTANT.
well, YOU KIND OF HAVE TO ADMIRE HER A LITTLE BIT.
it's GROSS.
there's SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT GIRL.
so...
Denise SEEMS NICE.
you KNOW, MORTGAGE BROKERS MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
we DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON.
I DON'T KNOW - YOU'RE GOING TO SAY I'M NOT A SNOB, BUT - TINA, HONEY, YOU ARE A SNOB.
I MEAN, COME ON, WE LOVE YOU, BUT YOU'RE A SNOB.
all RIGHT, WE'LL FIND SOMEBODY MORE YOUR STYLE,
someone, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, IN THE BIZ, OR
no, NO, NO, NO,
I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT WITH ANYONE IN THE MOVIE BUSINESS.
Tina, PICKY, PICKY, PICKY.
really. GOD...
okay, WE'LL FIND YOU SOMEONE IN THE ART WORLD,
or ART ADJACENT.
well, THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU, AM I RIGHT?
it IS.
you KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?
we SHOULD GO ON OURCHART, LOOK AT SOME MEMBER PROFILES.
Tina, DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.
I'm TRYING TO HELP YOU.
Jesus CHRIST.
Oh MY GOD,
I THINK I'M GOING TO VOMIT.
damn IT, HE'S SO FUCKING CUTE.
you SEE THAT GUY OVER THERE?
Jodi's INTERPRETER.
he HIT ON ME THE OTHER DAY IN THE MEN'S ROOM.
he's HANDSOME.
so?
are YOU ATTRACTED TO HIM?
no, OF COURSE NOT.
it WOULDN'T BE SUCH AN OUTLANDISH THING.
the LAST TRANS GUY I DATED
look, I'M NOT INTO MEN.
the LAST TRANS GUY I DATED WASN'T INTO MEN AT ALL
before HE TRANSITIONED.
she WAS A GOLD STAR BUTCH LESBIAN.
I'm NOT A GOLD STAR EITHER.
Julie WAS.
until SHE BECAME JAKE.
Jake TURNED OUT TO BE A GAY MAN.
I HEARD THIS THEORY THAT WHAT'S GENETICALLY ENCODED IN US
isn't ATTRACTION TO MEN OR ATTRACTION TO WOMEN,
but IT'S SAME-SEX ATTRACTION.
there YOU GO.
Adele, DO AWAY WITH THESE SWEATY THINGS.
Thanks.
Hi. -HI
wow, YOU'VE GOT GREAT ABS.
can I-- NO, NO, DON'T-DON'T...
just DON'T TOUCH ME TODAY, PLEASE.
she's NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.
I DON'T THINK SHE'S GOING TO MAKE IT.
where DID I PACK MY KEYS?
in YOUR BAG, DIDN'T YOU?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
Hey, LOOK, THE PINK RIDE.
Oh, I'M DOING IT.
I'm IN TRAINING FOR IT.
you ARE? -YES.
well, MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL DO IT.
do WHAT?
it's CALLED THE SUBARU PINK RIDE,
and IT'S FOR BREAST CANCER RESEARCH.
I WANT TO DO IT.
I THINK IT'D BE GREAT.
we SHOULD GET A LITTLE TEAM TOGETHER.
we COULD BE TEAM DANA.
Aw, I LOVE THAT. TEAM DANA.
Yeah, WE CAN GET KIT AND BETTE TO DO IT WITH US.
we SHOULD ASK DI AS WELL. - AND JODI.
Yeah, BUT JODI DIDN'T KNOW DANA.
Yeah, BUT SHE HAS BREASTS, RIGHT?
good POINT.
you GUYS,
you HAVE TO TRAIN FOR THIS.
it's SO HARD.
if YOU DON'T, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH IT.
why DON'T WE GET TASHA TO TRAIN US, 'CAUSE, I MEAN, SHE KNOWS HOW TO TRAIN,
obviously.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID TASHA WAS GOING TO IRAQ.
I THOUGH YOU SAID THAT HER UNIT GOT DELAYED.
Yeah, NO, THEY'RE JUST DELAYED.
I GUESS THEIR EQUIPMENT DIDN'T COME IN OR SOMETHING?
I DON'T KNOW.
it MUST HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.
ready?
let's GO.
thank YOU, LADIES.
nice DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU.
Hola, CHICA.
everybody's PAID UP.
feeling GOOD?
very GOOD.
see YOU LATER.
Oh, UM...
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE TO BAG ON BIG BEAR THIS WEEKEND.
Oh, NO, YOU DON'T.
I'm-I'm REALLY SORRY.
I KNOW IT'S FUCKED UP.
I HAVE A RECEPTION FOR DAVID HOCKNEY AT THE HAMMER ON SATURDAY.
so?
so, SEVERAL OF MY MAJOR DONORS ARE GOING TO BE THERE.
what?
we've BEEN DOING THIS FOR 11 YEARS,
and THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I WAS EVER GOING TO BRING ANYONE.
Really?
fuck DAVID HOCKNEY.
Hey.
Hi!
I GOT TO RUN. -OH, HI!
you, YOU WATCH YOURSELF.
don't GET TOO PERSONAL.
Oh, PLEASE, ME? WHAT?
I'm SO EXCITED WE'RE DOING THIS.
thank YOU SO MUCH.
why "FUCK DAVID HOCKNEY?
she WAS TRYING TO GET OUT OF GOING TO BIG BEAR THIS WEEKEND
to MEET A BUNCH OF MY OLD FRIENDS.
and YOU DIDN'T LET HER GET AWAY WITH IT?
good FOR YOU.
she MADE A COMMITMENT.
Hey, ALICE, WE'RE GOING TO SET UP OVER HERE.
okay. SHANE AND I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU
a COUPLE OF PROFILES OF GIRLS THAT WE THINK YOU SHOULD DATE.
no, NO PROFILES! -TINA
there's NOTHING WRONG WITH MEETING SOMEONE ON THE INTERNET.
nothing.
it's WEIRD. -COME ON!
Tina, YOU GOT TO LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.
it's LESS RANDOM THAN A BLIND DATE,
and YOU CAN FIND OUT ALL ABOUT THE GIRL BEFORE YOU WASTE YOUR TIME HAVING LUNCH WITH HER.
that's A REALLY GOOD POINT.
Hey, THE HAIR, START THE HAIR.
okay. -"THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE," JODI SAID.
do YOU MIND IF I JOIN YOU?
Oh, MY GOD, GET OVER HERE.
okay, SO, I'LL FIRST LIMIT IT TO THE,
you KNOW, PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN L.A.
and THEN I WILL LOOK FOR YOUR PRETENTIOUS ART PEOPLE.
how CAN YOU TELL FROM PICTURES?
Oh, BY THE WAY
somebody ANSWERS A QUESTION ON THEIR PROFILE.
favorite BOOK. CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN.
it's GOOD, PROMISING.
Nancy DREW, NOT SO MUCH.
I LOVE NANCY DREW.
me TOO. -REALLY?
okay, ALL RIGHT, NANCY DREW.
I MEAN, SHE IS A LESBIAN ICON.
that's A PRETTY SLICK-LOOKING CAMERA YOU GOT THERE.
Yeah, IT'S A PANASONIC DVX 100.
it's AMAZING, ACTUALLY.
and YOU'RE GOING TO HOOK IT UP TO THE COMPUTER?
we're RECORDING OVER FIREWIRE.
Yeah, IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO RECORD ONTO THE COMPUTER'S HARDDRIVE
at THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE RECORDING ONTO THE VIDEO CAMERA.
don't HAVE THE FUCKING SLIGHTEST IDEA
what YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
but IT SOUNDS AWESOME.
how ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO HER HAIR?
I DON'T KNOW YET.
little CLASSY OR SASSY. I DON'T KNOW.
want ME TO DO YOU?
Ooh, GO BACK! GO BACK! HER.
Ooh, WHAT ABOUT HER? SHE'S GOOD.
no, KEEP BROWSING.
Ow. WHAT? WHY? SHE'S TOTALLY CUTE.
Yeah, I KNOW SHE'S CUTE.
she's JUST A LITTLE CRAZY IN BED, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
how DO YOU KNOW?
next. -ROLL.
come.
I JUST GOT THIS FROM MY CO.
it's A CHAPTER 15 DISCHARGE.
I KNOW.
your COMMAND IS RECOMMENDING YOUR DISCHARGE FROM THE UNITED STATES ARMY
reserve FOR HOMOSEXUAL CONDUCT.
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T WANT MY CASE.
Oh, WELL, I'VE BEEN DETAILED YOUR CASE.
it SAYS SO RIGHT HERE, SO NOW I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
unless YOU DECIDE TO HIRE A CIVILIAN ATTORNEY.
I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO REPRESENT ME.
can WE GO OVER THE GROUNDS FOR SEPARATION?
first ALLEGATION.
on OR ABOUT MARCH, 2007,
you WERE SEEN AT THE SANTA ANITA RACETRACK WITH A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE OPENLY LESBIAN.
one OF THE WOMEN HAD HER ARM AROUND YOUR SHOULDER.
second ALLEGATION.
on OR AROUND MARCH, 2007,
you WERE AGAIN SEEN JUST OUTSIDE THE LOS ALAMITOS BASE WITH THE SAME WOMAN,
having WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LOVER'S QUARREL.
that's PRESUMPTION.
even IF I HAD BEEN SEEN,
brown MADE THAT CHARGE,
and I PERSONALLY KNOW HE HAS A GRUDGE AGAINST ME.
well, THE FIRST ALLEGATION WAS MADE BY YOUR PRIMARY ACCUSER,
whose NAME IS NOT LISTED IN THIS DOCUMENT,
but THE SECOND INCIDENT,
well, THAT'S BACKED UP BY YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER,
major KEVIN DIXON, WHO WAS ALSO WITNESS TO THE EVENT.
go ON.
there's ANOTHER LEGATION.
it ALLEGES HERE THAT YOU SHOWED A FEMALE SOLDIER IN YOUR UNIT,
preferential TREATMENT FOR JOB RECLASSIFICATION
because YOU WERE ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH HER.
that's TOTAL BULLSHIT.
please DON'T USE FOUL LANGUAGE IN MY OFFICE, WILLIAMS.
it's A FLAT-OUT LIE.
look, THESE ARE THE ALLEGATIONS,
and THEY DIDN'T COME OUT OF THE BLUE.
there's SOME SOLID EVIDENCE HERE BACKING THEM UP,
and IF IT'S NOT TRUE, THEN IT'S ON YOU TO PROVE IT.
now, LIKE IT OR NOT, THAT'S THE WAY THIS THING WORKS.
so, FOR MY NEXT QUESTION.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK THIS DELICATELY, BUT I'M
delicately?
what, I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SEX.
Yeah, BUT I WANT KNOW...
well, SOME PEOPLE LIKE DELICATE SEX.
ugh...
not ME. THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN...
tentative, TIMID LESBIAN SEX.
right
I WOULD NEVER BE IN ONE OF THOSE LESBIAN BED-DEATH RELATIONSHIPS
where YOU JUST CUDDLE, AND...
you KNOW, SAY GOODNIGHT AND GO TO SLEEP.
ugh...
I HAVE A TEDDY BEAR IF I WANT TO DO THAT.
Yes.
I WAS WATCHING, WAS THAT "LESBIAN"?
is THAT "LESBIAN"?
lesbian?
Oh, "LESBIAN."
that?
