l thought if we couId just get him in there why are you wasting our time on fantasies?
she said she wouId put him on one of the waiting Iists.
l mean, J, Jesus, ll'm just doing it for Dad.
dad's not the one that has a probIem with the VaIIey View.
l'm just trying to improve the situation. ls that a crime?
there's nothing wrong with Dad's situation. Dad's situation is filne.
he's never gonna adjust to it if we keep yanking him out.
and actuaIIy, this upward mobiIity filxation of yours it's counterproductive and, frankIy, pretty seIfilsh.
SeIfilsh?
because it's not about Dad, it's about you and your guiIt.
that's what these pIaces prey upon.
l happen to think it's nicer here.
of course you do, because you are the consumer they want to target.
you are the guiIty demographic. The Iandscaping, the neighborhoods of care
they're not for the residents, they're for the reIatives...
peopIe Iike you and me who don't want to admit to what's reaIIy going on here.
which is what, Jon? PeopIe are dying, wendy!
right inside that beautifuI buiIding right now, it's a fucking horror show!
and, and aII this weIIness propaganda and the Iandscaping lt's just there to obscure the miserabIe fact that peopIe die!
and death is gaseous and gruesome...
and it's filIIed with shit and piss and rotten stink!
come on, Nana.
there. what do you think?
what's it do?
nothing. lt's just something nice to Iook at. Oh.
Hey, how you doing, Mr. Savage? Hi, Jimmy.

that's having a midIife crisis here, when you're the one having an affair with a married guy...
instead of seeking reaI intimacy...
with someone who is avaiIabIe for reaI commitment.

Hey, hey, hey!

Jesus, Jon!

my friend in B26.
Oh, he's good.
l mean he's not good, but he's he's okay. He's filne.
he Iikes Tater Tots.
lt's the onIy thing he touches sometimes.
l give him extras when l can.
doubIe servings.
you married?
no.
but my boyfriend is.
does your mother know you're doing that?
she's not reaIIy in the picture.
she dead? That's why she never comes around, eh?
no. Just kind of obsoIete in the parenting department.
she just wasn't very good at it. Hmm.
neither was my father, actuaIIy.
so that's why a pretty woman doesn't have a husband or a famiIy of her own.
what do you do when you're not here?
l'm a, um a theater person.
l temp for money, but it's not my main thing. l write pIays.
like Shakespeare?
Yeah. weII, not as good.
what are your pIays about? What, my pIays?
can l read one? Are you kidding?
no, no. You actuaIIy want to read one of my pIays?
what's so strange about that?
no, it's just that, you know, in my worId...
peopIe don't usuaIIy want to read somebody's...
unproduced pIay.
your father's doing okay, by the way.
he's got some time Ieft.
how do you know? His toes.
they haven't started to curI under yet.
the toes, they aIways curI under a few days before.
what, is that some kind ofJamaican foIkIore thing or something?
l Iearned it from being here.
we aII taIk about it. lt's aIways the same.
the toes curI? Hmm.
like the witch in The wizard of Oz.
a coupIe of days before they go.
why, do you think?
they say it's the air Ieaving the body.
l'm from Nigeria, by the way.
Wendy.
thank you.
Oh, it's locked.
come on. Open it.
they pubIished the Iist in the paper, and your name wasn't on it.

the Guggenheim Foundation took out an ad in the New York Times...
announcing their feIIows for the year, and your name wasn't on it.
that's weird. Yeah.
must have been an oversight.
can you Can you Iet me in? l'm freezing.
Lt, lt wasn't. what?
an oversight.
how do you know?
because l caIIed the Guggenheim Foundation.
let me in the car.
Hi, Dad. Hi.
l caIIed them to filnd out why your name wasn't on the Iist.
why wouId you do that? 'Cause l was Iooking out for you.
you were poIicing me.
you're sick. That's sick, Jon.
no. You're sick.
you're the sick one, wendy.
a friend of mine does some consuIting for the Guggenheim Foundation.
he Iooked your name up in the computer.
you've been rejected eight times.
so? How many times have you been rejected?
fuck! That's not the point.
six. Hmm, no, no.
the point is you don't think l have any taIent.
the point is you caIIed them because you just couIdn't beIieve...
that your IittIe sister might just get one!
uh, that's not true. Yeah, yeah, it is true.
you're just Iike him. He never thought l couId do anything either.
why are you comparing me to Dad? Comparing you to what is the point?
No! You don't think l have taIent.
you just don't think l can do anything.
you obviously don't think you can do anything either...
because you have to fucking lie about itI
are you out of your mind? I'm out of my mind?
Where'd you get the money from, Wen? l got a grant.
just cut the crap, wendy. l got a grant, Jon! l did.
okay, filne, l didn't win a Guggenheim.
big fucking deaI.
lt was a different kind of grant.

l was granted the money.
what was the federaI emergency?
9 1 1 .
what does that have to do with you?
l worked downtown. l was affected.
everyone was affected. The whoIe worId was affected.
that doesn't mean they're going around taking money from peopIe who reaIIy need it.
there was no work for months. AII the tempsAII the temps appIied.
l was not the filrst one to
look, I, I am trying to get my life together.
by steaIing money from the federaI government?
l did not steaI it!
there's a thing where you can appIy if you Iost 25%. of your saIary or something Iike that!
l don't remember the detaiIs. You caII FEMA, you ask them.
l'm not. Look, they care about me more than you do.
I'm not calling FEMA. Okay?

look who it is.
Genghis.
pop the trunk.
here, there's emotion, an interest in what peopIe are feeIing.
whereas Brecht wants peopIe to think.
ln dramatic theater, you have suggestion...
but Brecht wants an argument.
excuse me one minute.
HeIIo?
Yes, it is.
okay, thank you.
Mr. Savage?

people of the city of New York......I am here today because I fell 62 stories......and someone caught me.
someone who never asks for anything in return.
someone who doesn't even want us to know who he is.
Hey, M. J.
Harry. - Hey.
Where's Pete?
taking somebody's picture, I guess. - Right.
I'm so happy to see you. You look so good, Harry.
I've never felt better.
it's a weird feeling not knowing who you are.
bump on the head, I'm as free as a bird.
will you bump me on the head?
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.
you came. You sent me flowers.
I did? I'll come again tonight.
you can't. I was let go.
what happened?
I wasn't very good.
you know, this is embarrassing......but I once wrote you a play in high school.
you wrote me a play? - Yeah.
Harry, that's the sweetest thing.
so I ask you: When you're dropping without a parachute......or your store's being robbed or your house is on fire......who is it that breaks your fall......puts out the flames and saves your children?
Spider-Man.
they love me.
then let's hear it for your one and only......friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
Hey. What's up? All right. How you doing?
shazam!
Hey, guys.
Spider-Man. Spider-Man.
hey there. Hi.
kiss him. - Kiss him.
kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.
go ahead, lay one on me.
Really? - Yeah, they'll love it.
kiss her. - Kiss him.
no, Spider-Man, no.
all right.
hope Pete's getting a shot of this.
Hey, hey, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, man, we got something on the roof.
jig's up, pal.
I don't wanna hurt you. Leave now.
I guess you haven't heard. I'm the sheriff around these parts.
okay.
help!
where do all these guys come from?
I'm sorry, I don't speak...
but this is a French restaurant, non?
name, please? - Parker, Peter.
here we are.
table for two. Parker.
Parker. - That is what I said: Parker.
I have a request.
my girlfriend will be coming and I have this ring.
hello.
Oh, so you want to pop the question tonight, huh?
Yes, and I wanna do something very special.
I love it. Romance.
I am French.
when I signal you, if you'd bring some champagne with the ring...
in the bottom of her glass? - Perfect.
also, I thought at the same time......if the musicians would play this song...
their favorite.
and take good care of the ring.
Oui, with my life, monsieur.
I like you.
thank you.
okay, so...
Oh, would you like some champagne?
how'd that get in there?
Oh, don't cry.
Hi.
look at you. Wow, beautiful.
Thanks.
this place in your budget?
Oh, well, it's a special occasion.
you're on Broadway.
I don't feel like much of a star tonight.
well, you are a star. And you've earned it.
Peter......you have no idea how I feel right now.
Oh, no, I know exactly how you feel.
listen, I have been through this. It happens to me all the time.
I see Spider-Man posters in the window...
...kids running around with me on their sweaters...
big Halloween item.
I don't know, I guess I've become something of an icon.
like yesterday, they kept screaming, "Spider-Man, Spider-Man.
I don't know, you know, I mean, I'm thinking to myself:
I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens. Do I deserve this?
Hi, Pete.
Hi.
Hi, my parents and I were just having dinner here.
hello. I'm Gwen Stacy. - Hi.
this is Mary Jane Watson.
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Pete talks about you all the time.
Gwen is my lab partner in Dr. Connors' class.
Pete's something of a genius. I'd be completely lost without him.
which actually reminds me...
...Pete, if you've got a picture of my kiss with Spider-Man...
...could you bring it to class?
I'd really love it. For my portfolio.
after all, who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?
I can't imagine.
well, it was lovely to meet you.
good night. - Good night.
Oh, she's in my science class.
it's not her best subject.
what?
how come you never mentioned her?
she's your lab partner?
you saved her life?
she thinks you're a genius......and she had her polished fingernails all over you?
or didn't you notice?
and she gave Spider-Man the key to the city.
I'll never forget that.
she's just a girl in my class.
let me ask you something.
when you kissed her......who was kissing her?
spider-man or Peter?
what do you mean? - You know exactly what I mean.
that was our kiss.
why would you do that?
you must have known how it'd make me feel.
do you wanna push me away? - Push you away?
why would I wanna push you away? I love you.
you're my girlfriend. She's a girl in my class, M. J.
I don't feel well. I'm sorry, I have to go.
no, w...
where are you going? - Please, don't follow me.
here we are.
Hi, it's M. J. Sing your song at the beep.
hello.
I wish you'd pick up the phone. I don't know what's going on or...
I don't know if you got the messages or what.
But......I just wanna talk to you.
okay, call me. Bye.
Hello? - Mr. Parker?
yeah?
this is Detective Neil Garrett from the 32nd Precinct.
I'm calling on behalf of Captain Stacy.
he would like you to come down to the station.
originally, we thought that this man, Dennis Carradine......was your husband's killer.
we were wrong.
what?
turns out Mr. Carradine was only an accomplice.
the actual killer is still at large.
what are you talking about?
this is the man who killed your husband.
his name is Flint Marko.
he's a small-time crook who's been in and out of prison.
you got this wrong.
two days ago he escaped.
evidently, he confessed his guilt to a cellmate......and we have a couple of witnesses who will corroborate the story.
no, wait, son. You don't wanna do this.
No!
Hey, get in! What are you doing?
would you put these photos away, please?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker. I know this isn't easy......but, please, be patient with us.
we're doing our job. We will catch him.
no, you're not doing your job.
I watched my uncle die, and we chased down the wrong man.
now you're telling me you had suspicions for two years? Witnesses?
why weren't we told about this? - Settle down.
I have no intention of settling down.
this man killed my uncle, and he's still out there!
L-20 Parkway.
all officers in the vicinity, please report.
we have an abandoned vehicle......and an elderly man in the middle of the street.
sorry, Wabash Avenue.
Peter, it's M. J.
I'm not here about what happened at dinner.
just please open up.
aunt May called me. She told me about what happened.
she's worried about you.
I'm worried about you.
don't be. I'm fine.
I don't want you to do something stupid.
like try to find my uncle's killer?
and do something you'll regret.
like with that other guy.
he had a gun on me. I made a move and he fell. I told you that.
I'm not accusing you of anything. - 10-22, auto at 556...
will you turn that thing off? - Crossing 5-6 to 5-7.
Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9 responding to your Sixth Avenue call.
Peter, I'm here because I care about you.
and I know that you made a mistake and that you feel guilty......but I wanna be here for you.
okay. I get it. Thank you.
but I'm fine. L...
I don't need your help.
everybody needs help sometimes, Peter.
even Spider-Man.

did you?
where am I?
what is this?
I feel...
this feels good.
Yeah!
this is something else.
what do you think?
I've never seen anything like it.
I'm a physicist, not a biologist......but let me look at it in the morning. Run some tests.
can we do that now?
it seems to like you.
don't let any of that get on you. - Why not?
it has the characteristics of a symbiote......which needs to bond to a host to survive.
and sometimes these things in nature, when they bind......they can be hard to unbind.
bank robbery in progress, First Eastern Bank at 202 Bismark.
another sandstorm is reported in the vicinity.
all cars proceed with caution. - Marko.
buddy, love the new outfit.
this is exactly what I need to scoop Parker.
give some of that web action.
see you, chump.
what the hell?
flint Marko.
what do you want from me? - Remember Ben Parker?
the old man you shot down in cold blood?
what does it matter to you, anyway?
everything!
it's time to pay, Marko!
good riddance.
rent. - Not now.
listen, it's a free country. It's not rent-free country.
leave me alone. - Give me rent.
you'll get your rent when you fix this damn door!
that wasn't cool.
he is a good boy.
he must be in some kind of trouble.
flint Marko, the man who killed Uncle Ben......he was killed last night.
Oh, my.
what happened?
spider-man killed him.
spider-man?
I don't understand.
spider-man doesn't kill people.
what happened?
I...
he...
he was...
I thought that you'd feel...
he deserved it, didn't he?
I don't think it's for us to say......whether a person deserves to live or die.
but, Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben.
uncle Ben meant the world to us.
but he wouldn't want us living one second......with revenge in our hearts.
it's like a poison. It can...It can take you over.
before you know it, turn us into something ugly.
he said it was a good idea. - Yeah.
Hello?
Hey, Harry, it's M. J.
Hi.
I need some company.
are you doing anything? Can I stop by?
Yeah, sure, come on over.
okay. Are you sure it's okay?
no, I'm not doing anything. Please, come over.
okay, I'll see you soon. - Great.
Bye.
Bernard. - Yes, Mr. Osborn?
we're having a guest. Can you get some food?
a guest? - Yeah, a guest.
a "guest" guest? - Will you just get some food?
right away, sir.
Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch.
an orange? - No, thanks.
listen, I'm really sorry for what happened earlier.
I shouldn't have yelled about that door. It was nothing to be angry about.
it's no big deal.
but if you feel that bad about it, you can buy me pizza sometime.
today's good. - Okay.
have problem with the phone? - No, no. I was just...
well, I was trying to figure out what to say.
if it's a woman you're calling, then you say:
you're a good woman. I am good man.
Hi, Pete. - Hi.
he's calling a woman.
Mary Jane? I think that would be so good...
this is none of your business. Go. Go. Call.
you should call. - Thanks.
Bye. - Bye.
Hi.
you hungry? - Yeah.
come on.
I hope you like peppers. - I love them.
no. Please.
Oh, the butter.
beautiful.
check this out.
well, we can use that part.
you've been dreaming.
nothing like a little self-deception to get you through the night.
all right. - When did you write that?
twelfth grade. - It's intense.
so you want the part? - I'd love to be in your play.
it's yours.
you know, there's not even a scar.
barely.
sorry. - Me too.
I didn't mean to do that. - No, it's okay. Please, forgive me.
Mary Jane.
Mary Jane.
Mary Jane, please. - I'm sorry.
just...
you've taken your eye off the ball.
Harry.
what have you done?
avenge me!
my father, he died, right? - Yeah.
just wish I could remember more about him.
well, he loved you. That's the main thing.
I swear on my father's grave, Spider-Man will pay.
Harry.
remember me?
Yes, Father. I remember.
I was right about her. About Peter.
about everything.
you know what you must do. Make him suffer.
make him wish he were dead.
first, we attack his heart.
Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep.
Hey, M. J. It's Peter.
I wanna talk to you about last night.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I know you were just there to help and I...
I don't know. I wanna see you.
if you want Peter to live, you're gonna do something for me.
yeah? - It's Ursula.
come in.
Hi, Pete. - Hi.
there's a phone call for you.
it's Mary Jane, she called back.
Really? - Yeah.
I put the phone on top of the thing. - Thanks. Okay.
Hey. - Hi.
Oh, I'm so glad you called. I've been trying to...
can you meet me? - You bet.
now? - Okay. Where?
at the bridge in the park.
on my way. - Okay.
okay. Hey. I love you.
you look beautiful.
peonies.
you okay? - No.
there's something I have to tell you, Pete.
okay.
it's not working. You and me.
what?
I don't wanna see you anymore.
what are you talking about?
I don't know.
I'm lonely.
you aren't there for me.
I can't do this.
it's over. - No. Please. Please don't say that.
I know I've been selfish, but I can do better. I can change.
it's not that simple. - We love each other. I love you.
we have problems. When people have problems......they work it out. They talk to each other.
look, you see?
you know what this is?
you know what I want for us? - There's someone else.
I've fallen in love with someone else.
Bravo.
she says that she's lonely, that I'm not there for her.
there's another guy.
well, how you holding up?
not good.
Harry, I was gonna propose to her.
Really?
well, she's been going through a tough time lately. Career.
I mean, a singing waitress at a jazz club?
it's not exactly what she had in mind for herself.
singing waitress? What are you...? What are you talking about?
well, she was fired from the show. Didn't she tell you?
she was fired?
she was fired and she told you? She didn't tell me?
well, that's why I asked you here, Pete.
I'm the other guy.
what?
look, she came to me one afternoon, troubled.
she needed someone and I was there for her.
I've always loved her, Pete. You know that.
it just......started.
I don't believe this. I don't... I don't believe you.
look, I'm really sorry.
I just thought you should know.
can I warm you up? - Yes, please.
how's the pie?
so good.
would you like a drink?
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?
bad for the public image, right, Mr. Key-to-the-City?
what did you do to her?
I did what you failed to do. I was there for her.
Mary Jane and I, we understand each other.
she doesn't know what you are. - Peter, she knows me very well.
and when she kissed me, it was just like she used to kiss me.
that taste...
strawberries.
how'd you like that, Spidey?
that all you got?
stings, doesn't it? - I protected you in high school.
now I'm gonna kick your little ass.
gonna kill me like you killed my father?
I'm done trying to convince you.
you took him from me. He loved me.
no. He despised you.
you were an embarrassment to him.
look at little Goblin Junior. Gonna cry?
spider-man used to make me feel safe.
now I'm afraid to walk home from work.
my son thought the world of this guy. - I have a daughter, loves Spider-Man.
who's she to look up to? - This is the guy they gave the key to?
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.
cheers to the new staff photographer. - Hey, I just got lucky.
this is so wonderful for you.
well, you might wanna tell J. J. To make a little more wall space.
wow, good morning. It's a beautiful day, huh?
what was it you said? I'll never get that picture?
there's your hero.
I never thought he'd really do that. - See? Right there.
you made a judgment call. You gotta see it as it is.
funny you should say that...
...because I was looking through some old photos and it looks very...
...similar.
okay. Well, I gotta get back to work.
you're trash, Brock. - Excuse me?
your picture's a fake.
Oh, Parker, you are such a boy scout.
when are you gonna give a guy a break?
you want forgiveness? Get religion.
what's going on here? - Are you guys all right?
Yeah. No, we... We're just horsing around.
look, I'm begging you. If you do this, I will lose everything.
there's not a paper in town that will hire me.
you should've thought of that earlier.
what are you doing, Peter?
show this to your editor. Tell him to check his source next time.
it's a fake.
empire State Photographic Department confirms it.
pack your things. Get out of my building.
I was just trying... - You're fired.
we're gonna have to print a retraction now.
I haven't printed a retraction in 20 years.
hello. - Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here.
Oh, Dr. Connors. How are you?
quite a specimen you left me, Parker.
its chemistry is not unlike the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.
Thanks.
that's good. - You know what, Parker?
Parker? - Get me some milk.
it amplifies characteristics of its host.
Hey, give me another cookie. - Especially aggression.
this could be dangerous.
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?
you got any with nuts? - I have some nuts. I could make some.
go make me some. - Peter?
no, no, no. Course not.
these shots are so good.
I'd love to shoot you sometime.
Peter Parker. Peter.
Parker. Miss Brant, that's not the position I hired you for.
Black-suit Spider-Man.
Peter, these are incredible.
we gotta have these, Jonah. - I'll pay you the usual rate.
if you want the shots, I'll take the staff job......double the money.
penny.
you are really gonna dig this joint.
do you think I'm...? I'm dressed all right?
too fancy or too...
are you kidding me? You're looking fine, babe.
thank you. - Love that little giggle.
Hey, keep it open there, pops.
Oh, this is so cool.
I have never been to a jazz club before.
Oh, I hope we can get a table.
find us some shade.
Thanks, hot legs.
right this way, sir.
Oh, why, thank you.
I am so loving this. - Oh, me too.
isn't that your old girlfriend? - Yeah.
do you wanna go someplace else? - Oh, no, no. I'll... I'll be okay.
Mary Jane, show us what you got. - I'll take that.
I'll be right back. - All right.
Peter?
this is for you.
double-time.
Thanks.
now dig on this.
that is hot.
that was all for her?
I'm so sorry.
you all right, Mary Jane? - I'm fine.
okay.
Hey.
what's wrong with you?
you.
can I help you, sir? - No.
is everything okay here, Paul?
Yeah, is everything okay here, Paul?
take him out of here. - Let's go, sir.
take your hand off of me. - Now.
okay. - Hey, get off. Let go.
Peter, stop it!
who are you?
I don't know.
it's Brock, sir.
edward Brock Jr.
I come before you today......humbled......and humiliated......to ask you for one thing.
I want you to kill Peter Parker.
Parker.
Hi, Peter. - Hi.
you don't seem to have changed the room around very much.
of course, there's not much you could do, is there?
when we spoke on the phone......I sensed that something was bothering you......so I thought I'd just come by.
how's Mary Jane?
I don't know.
I never heard from you.
did you ever propose?
you said......a husband's gotta put a wife before himself.
I'm not ready.
but what happened?
you seemed so sure.
Yeah.
I...
I hurt her, Aunt May.
I don't know what to do.
well, you start by doing the hardest thing:
you forgive yourself.
I believe in you, Peter.
you're a good person.
and I know you will find a way to put it right.
in time.
end of the line, Spider-Man.
I want him dead too, Flint.
that's why I've been looking for you.
Oh, yeah. I know all about you.
like the fact that Spider-Man won't let you help your poor daughter.
it's just... That doesn't seem right to me.
look, I wanna kill the spider, you wanna kill the spider.
together, he doesn't stand a chance.
interested?
Yeah.
so...
all New York is holding its breath......as the hostage crisis continues to unfold.
just 30 minutes ago......police came across this startling sight:
a young woman, held hostage in a taxi......suspended 80 stories above the ground......in what appears to be a giant web.
every attempt by the police to rescue the hostage......has been thwarted by the Sandman.
compounding the danger......is the appearance of a strange black-suited figure.
early reports had believed him to be the black-suited Spider-Man......but he has now been identified as something entirely different.
the hostage has been identified as Mary Jane Watson......an actress recently seen in a brief stint on Broadway.
we're now going to take you live to the scene......with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer?
we're only about 100 feet away now, Hal, and...
wait. There seems to be some kind of activity in the web.
they seem to be creating some kind of gigantic lettering.
Spider-Man's being challenged to some sort of confrontation.
and that raises serious questions......about what kind of chance he'd stand against such overwhelming...
Harry?
I need your help.
I can't take them both, not by myself.
you don't deserve my help.
Harry......she needs us.
get out.
if I may, sir?
I've seen things in this house I've never spoken of.
what are you trying to tell me?
the night your father died......I cleaned his wound.
the blade that pierced his body......came from his glider.
I know you're trying to defend your father's honor......but there's no question that he died by his own hand.
I loved your father......as I have loved you, Harry.
as your friends love you.
look.
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
he seems to have come out of nowhere......to answer the prayers of the city......just when all hope seemed to be lost.
Peter. They're gonna kill us both.
I'm gonna get you out of this. - Watch out.
Hey, Parker.
my God. Eddie.
my spider-sense is tingling......if you know what I'm talking about.
we can find a way to settle this.
you're so right.
I'm thinking humiliation.
kind of like how you humiliated me.
do you remember?
do you remember what you did to me?
you made me lose my girl. Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.
how's that sound, tiger?
hold on, Mary Jane!
Mary Jane!
it's hard to believe what's happening.
the brutality of it.
I don't know how he can take any more.
this could be a tragic day for the people of New York.
it could be the end of Spider-Man.
awesome. - Wicked cool.
you came.
looks like just in the nick of time.
a couple minutes ago wouldn't have been so bad either.
what are you gonna do?
I may need some help over here.
I'm a little busy right now.
give me your hand.
Parker! Parker, where...?
I need a photographer.
Hey, kid, you want a job?
why would I want a job? I'm just a kid.
all right, how much for the camera? - One hundred bucks.
a hundred bucks?
all right, you little crook. Here.
what the...?
film's extra.
gotcha.
Pete, up top.
Mary Jane.
this thing got any more? - Hang on.
to what?
go, buddy. - Got her.
you okay?
Yeah.
good. - Hey, Pete.
am I interrupting?
never wound......what you can't kill.
Eddie, the suit, you gotta take it off.
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
I know what it feels like.
it feels good.
the power. Everything.
but you'll lose yourself.
let it go.
I like being bad.
it makes me happy.
Harry!
Peter. What are you doing?
No!
Eddie!
Harry. - Mary Jane.
I'm gonna get help. - No.
stay.
I didn't want this.
but I had no choice.
we always have a choice.
you had a choice when you killed my uncle.
my daughter was dying.
I needed money.
I was scared.
I told your uncle all I wanted was the car.
what is it? - I need your car.
he said to me:
why don't you just put down the gun and go home?
I realize now he was just trying to help me.
then I saw my partner running over with the cash.
and the gun was in my hand.
get in.
did a terrible thing to you......and I spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back.
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I just want you to understand.
I've done terrible things too.
I didn't choose to be this.
the only thing left of me now......is my daughter.
I forgive you.
Hey, pal. How you doing?
been better.
we'll get you through this.
no.
I should never have hurt you...
...said those things.
none of that matters, Peter.
you're my friend.
best friend.
Harry.
whatever comes our way......whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice.
my friend Harry taught me that.
he chose to be the best of himself.
it's the choices that make us who we are......and we can always choose to do what's right.
then
mom.
mom is a babe.
are you a hunter?
Hey, Winchester!
son of a bitch!
how you doin', corporal?
Hey, Mr. D.
dad?
this is gonna sound a little crazy.
Mary is my mother.
excuse me?
and I am your grandson.
my parents are Mary and John Winchester.
I don't know - Mary gets killed by a yellow-eyed demon.
you don't want those people's souls.
no, I just want their children.
why any of them?
I'm gonna stand over their crib, and I'm gonna bleed into their mouths.
so, you've been using your freaky E.S.P. stuff?
no. - Sure about that?
look, you didn't want me to go down that road, so I didn't go down that road.
well, let's keep it that way.
we know what Azazel did to your brother.
what we don't know is why.
your brother is heading down a dangerous road, Dean, so stop it.
or we will.
now
Where's Lilith?
kiss my ass.
I'd watch myself if I were you.
Why?
because you're Sam Winchester, Mr. Big hero?
and yet here you are, slutting around with some demon.
real hero.
shut your mouth.
tell me about those months without your brother.
about all the things you and this demon bitch do in the dark.
tell me, hero.
metamorphosis
how'd it feel?
good.
no more headaches.
none?
that is good.
I got you.
it's all right.
so.
anything you want to tell me, Sam?
Dean, hold on, okay?
just let me - You gonna say, "let me explain"?
you're gonna explain this?
why don't you start with who she is and what the hell is she doing here?
it's good to see you again, Dean.
is that ruby?
ruby, stop it.
well, aren't you an obedient little bitch?
he's hurt.
go.
where the hell do you think you're going?
the E.R. unless you want to go another round first.
Dean, what are you doing?
what, are you -- are you leaving?
you don't need me.
you and ruby go fight demons.
hold on.
Dean, come on, man.
you satisfied?
do you even know how far off the reservation you've gone?
how far from normal?
from human?
I'm just exorcising demons.
with your mind!
what else can you do?
I can send them back to hell.
it only works with demons, and that's it.
what else can you do?
I told you!
and I have every reason in the world to believe that.
look, I should have said something.
I'm sorry, Dean.
I am.
but try to see the other side here.
the other side?
I'm pulling demons out of innocent people.
use the knife!
the knife kills the victim!
what I do, most of them survive!
look, I've saved more people in the last five months than we save in a year.
that what Ruby wants you to think?
kind of like the way she tricked you into using your powers?
slippery slope, brother.
just wait and see.
because it's gonna get darker and darker, and god knows where it ends.
I'm not gonna let it go too far.
it's already gone too far, Sam.
if I didn't know you.
I would want to hunt you.
and so would other hunters.
you were gone.
I was here.
I had to keep on fighting without you.
and what I'm doing.
it works.
well, tell me.
if it's so terrific.
then why'd you lie about it to me?
why did an angel tell me to stop you?
what?
cas said that if I don't stop you, he will.
see, what that means, Sam -- that means that god doesn't want you doing this.
so, are you just gonna stand there and tell me that everything is all good?
Hello?
Hey, Travis. Yeah, hey.
it's good to hear your voice, too, yeah.
um, look, it's not a really good time right now.
Yeah, okay.
uh, well, just give me the details, and, uh -- Carthage, Missouri.
looking for Jack Montgomery.
Jack, are you stoned?
what?
it's good.
I'm starving.
is -- is there dessert?
it just so happens.
Hey, babe?
are you gonna finish your steak?
you're kidding, right?
you've had two already.
I don't know. I'm just.
hungry.
or you have tapeworm.
please.
I never felt better.
I can't believe it.
mom -- a hunter?
I wouldn't have believed it, either, if I hadn't seen it myself.
that woman could kick some ass.
I mean, she almost took me down.
how'd she look?
I mean.
was she happy?
Yeah, she was awesome.
funny and smart.
so hopeful.
dad, too.
until, of course.
what?
nothing.
it's just -- our parents, and now we find out our grandparents, too?
our whole family murdered, and for what?
so yellow eyes could get in my nursery and bleed in my mouth?
Sam, I never said anything about demon blood.
you knew about that?
Yeah, for about a year.
a whole year.
I should have told you. I'm sorry.
you've been saying that a lot lately, Sam.
but whatever.
you don't want to tell me, you don't have to.
it's fine. Dean.
whatever.
Hey, babe, when's dinner?
45 minutes.
I'm starving!
Jack, a delicious, unmicrowaved, non-takeout, homemade meal is coming.
are you sure that's him?
only Jack Montgomery in town.
and we're looking for.
Travis said to keep an eye out for anything weird.
weird?
Yeah.
all right, well, yeah, I've seen big weird, little weird, weird with crazy on top.
but this guy?
I mean, come on, this guy's boring.
I don't know, Dean.
Travis seemed pretty sure.
I'd say that qualifies as weird.
see, Sam. Told you we should have hid the beer.
smartass.
get over here!
Ohh, good to see you.
you too. - Good to see you.
you too, Travis.
man, you got tall, kid.
how long has it been?
Oh, got to be 10 years.
you still a -- oh, what was it?
a mathlete?
no.
Yep, sure is.
been too long, boys.
I mean, look at you -- grown men.
John would have been damn proud of you.
sticking together like this.
Yeah.
Yeah, we're as thick as thieves.
nothing more important than family.
sorry I'm late for the dance.
thanks for helping out an old man.
I'm a little, uh, shorthanded.
so, you track down Montgomery?
Yeah, we found him at his home.
And?
well, he had a hell of a case of the munchies, topped off with a burger that he forgot to cook.
that's him, all right.
what's him?
boys, we got a rougarou on our hands.
a rougarou?
is that made up? That sounds made up.
they're mean, nasty little suckers
rotted teeth, wormy skin, the works.
well, that ain't this guy.
I mean, he was wearing a cellphone on his belt.
he'll turn ugly soon enough.
they start out human, for all intents and purposes.
so, what, they go through some kind of metamorphosis?
Yep, like a maggot turning into a bull fly.
but most of all, they're hungry.
hungry for what?
at first, for everything, but then for long pig.
long pig?
he means human flesh.
and that is my word of the day.
hunger grows in till they can't fight it,
what happens?
they transform completely and fast.
I think I need stitches.
I got to go.
what?
I got to get out of here.
where are you going?
one bite's all it takes -- eyes, teeth, skin all turns.
no going back, either.
they feed once, they're a monster forever.
and our man Jack's headed there on a bullet train.
well, how'd you find this guy if he's a walking, talking human?
let's just say it runs in his family.
you mean, uh.
killed his daddy back in '78.
son of a bitch mangled eight bodies before I put him down.
guy used to be a dentist -- Cadillac, trophy wife.
little did I know, pregnant trophy wife.
she put the boy up for adoption.
by the time I found out, he was long gone, lost in the system.
you mean to tell me you couldn't find someone?
I'm not sure I wanted to.
the idea of hunting down some poor kid.
I don't think I'd have had the heart.
no.
wanted to wait, make damn sure I had the right man.
apparently, I do.
one more, please.
can I get some more peanuts?
come on.
what are you drinking?
it's my treat.
no, thank you.
Oh, don't be like that.
have a drink with me.
I'm waiting for someone.
okay, well, where is he?
Hey, douche bag.
she doesn't want to talk to you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you.
I said.
she doesn't want to talk to you, you fat.
sweaty.
Dick.
now, leave her alone.
you, uh, seriously want to do this, guy?
you know, I really think I do.
so, fire, huh?
the only way I found to kill these bastards -- deep-fry 'em.
well, that's gonna be.
horrible.
is that what you did to Jack's dad?
not wasting any time, are you?
none to waste.
the guy hulks out, we won't be finding bodies, just remains.
what if he doesn't hulk out?
I did a little homework.
I've been checking out the lure on rougarous.
what, my 30 years of experience not good enough for you?
what?
no. No, I-I just wanted to be prepared.
I mean, not that you didn't - Sam loves research.
he does.
he keeps it under his mattress right next to his K-Y.
it's a sickness.
it is.
look, everything you said checked out, of course, but, uh,
see, they start to turn, but they never take the final step.
Really?
see, if they never eat human flesh, they don't fully transform.
so, what -- go vegan, stay human?
basically. Or in this case, eat a lot of raw meat, just not
long pig.
right.
good on you for the due diligence, Sam.
but those are fairy tales.
fact is, every rougarou I ever saw or heard of.
took that bite.
okay, well, that doesn't mean that Jack will.
so, what do we do?
sit and hope and wait for a body count?
no, we talk to him, explain what's happening.
that way, he can fight it.
fight it?
are you kidding me?
you ever been really hungry?
I mean, haven't-eaten-in-days hungry?
Yeah.
Yeah.
right, then.
somebody slaps a big, juicy sirloin in front of you, you walking away?
that's what we are to him now -- meat on legs.
I'm sorry. I'm sure he's a stand-up guy.
but it's pure, base instinct.
everything in nature's got to eat.
you think he can stop himself 'cause he's nice?
I don't know.
but we're not gonna kill him unless he does something to get killed for.
what's up with your brother?
God.
you scared me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.
how are you feeling?
I'm feeling pissed, Jack.
I had to drive myself to the hospital last night.
I was there until 2: 00.
I'm so sorry.
what happened? - I don't know.
I saw your blood, and I-I.
got dizzy, and I just had to get out.
well, you could have called.
I left you a dozen messages.
I know. My phone died.
I couldn't find a pay phone.
I -- it was a mess.
but I am.
sorry.
and I promise it won't ever happen again.
certainly.
not to a wife as stunning as you.
better not.
I swear, you know.
one little cut.
blood's never bothered you before.
well.
I've changed.
this doesn't get you off the hook, you know.
no, no.
think -- think diamond.
think kobe-sized.
what has gotten into you?
I don't know.
just slow down.
Jack, I mean it.
stop.
stop!
stop it!
stop it!
you son of a bitch.
I'm sorry.
what the hell is wrong with you?
I don't know.
I don't know.
all right, so we're gonna go have a little chat with this guy, which, you know, I'm down.
but I just want to make sure, if push comes, you're gonna shove.
Meaning?
well, odds are we're gonna have to burn this guy alive.
this guy has a name and a wife.
Yeah, who we're probably gonna make a widow, okay?
I mean, you heard Travis.
he's gonna turn.
they always turn.
well, maybe he won't.
maybe he can fight it off.
and maybe he can't.
that's all I'm saying.
all right, we'll just have to see, then, okay?
this is what I mean, Sam.
you sure your emotions aren't getting in the way here?
what are you talking about?
you know, nice dude, but he's got something evil inside.
something in his blood.
maybe you can relate.
stop the car.
what? - Stop the car or I will!
you want to know why I've been lying to you, Dean?
because of crap like this! - Like what?
the way you talk to me, the way you look at me like I'm a freak!
I do not. - You know, or even worse, like I'm an idiot!
like I don't know the difference between right and wrong!
what?
do you know the difference, Sam?
I mean, you've been kind of strolling a dark road lately.
you have no idea what I'm going through.
none. - Then enlighten me!
I've got demon blood in me, Dean!
this disease pumping through my veins, and I can't ever rip it out or scrub it clean!
I'm a whole new level of freak!
and I'm just trying to take this -- this curse.
and make something good out of it.
because I have to.
let's just go talk to the guy.
I mean Jack.
okay?
I'm Sam Winchester. This is my brother -- Dean.
we need to talk.
about?
about you.
about how you're changing.
excuse me?
you're probably feeling your bones move under your skin.
and your appetite's reaching, you know, hungry hungry hippo levels.
how am I doing so far?
who the hell are you guys?
we're people who know a little something about something.
we're people who can help.
please, just hear us out.
a-a what?
a rougarou.
sounds made-up, I know, but, believe me, it's not.
all right, I've noticed certain things.
I mean, some strange things, but I just -- I don't know.
I'm -- I'm sick or something.
your father was one of these things.
your real father.
he passed it on to you.
no.
are you guys listening to yourselves?
you sound like you're
skip the whole "you guys sound crazy," shall we?
you're hungry, jack.
you're only gonna get hungrier.
hungrier for?
long pig.
you know, a little man burger helper may have crossed your mind already.
no.
it doesn't have to be like this, Jack.
you can fight it off.
others have.
you're gonna feel like an alcoholic swimming around in whiskey.
but I'm telling you, you got to say no, or
or what?
you feed once, and it's all over.
and then we'll have to stop you.
stop me?
my dad -- did, uh, somebody stop him?
Yes.
get off my property right now.
I see you guys again, I'm calling the cops.
Jack, your wife, everybody you know, they're in danger.
now!
good talk.
Jack, I don't know where you are, but you're scaring me.
come home.
we need to talk.
please?
damn it, Jack, no!
come on.
wait!
uh, we're here to save you, I guess.
we should go. - Yeah.
Michelle, I'm home.
Hey, babe?
are you here?
we're gonna stay calm.
we're gonna give this man whatever he wants.
anything.
just take it and go, please.
I'm sorry about this, Jack.
I truly am.
it's not the way that I wanted it to go.
who are you?
you already met some friends of mine.
two brothers?
they said that if I -- look, I haven't hurt anybody.
not yet, but you would've.
they always do.
I'm doing you a favor, son.
Jack, what's he talking about?
tell her, jack.
tell her the truth.
she deserves to know.
just let her go.
she's not a part of this.
a part of what?
I really do apologize, but she is part of it.
what?
tell him what you told me when I got here.
I said.
don't hurt me.
because I'm pregnant.
j-just hold on a minute.
now you see the mess we're in?
I can't make this mistake all over again.
I won't be around in 30 years.
this has got to end now.
I know you don't believe me, but I'd give anything not to have to do this.
no.
Oh, god.
please don't!
you don't have to do this!
if you want to kill me, kill me, but not my wife.
okay?
I'm begging you.
ain't got no choice.
my condolences.
stay away from me!
I guess now we know where Travis is.
that stupid son of a bitch.
Oh, god.
think that's Travis?
what's left of him.
guess you were right about Jack.
Dean can't come to the phone right now.
if you hurt him, I swear to god!
calm down!
your brother's alive.
but not if you don't calm down!
all right, Jack.
listen.
open the door.
we can figure this out, okay?
we'll have ourselves a little brainstorming session.
Jack, please.
I don't think so.
after what you did?
what?
what are you talking about?
you sent your friend here.
he tried to burn my wife alive!
what?
Why?
he didn't say.
I guess psychopaths don't have to explain themselves.
listen to me.
you got to believe me.
my brother and I, we never would have hurt her, okay?
Oh, god, I'm so hungry.
Jack, don't do this.
I can't ever see my family again.
you two.
your friend -- you made me into this!
no one's making you kill us.
listen to me.
you got this dark pit inside you.
I know.
believe me, I know.
but that doesn't mean you have to fall into it.
you don't have to be a monster.
have you seen me lately?
it doesn't matter what you are.
it only matters what you do.
it's your choice.
you did the right thing, you know.
that guy was a monster.
there was no going back.
Sam, I want to tell you I'm sorry.
I've been kind of hard on you lately.
don't worry about it, Dean.
and we had some fun it's just that your, uh --your psychic thing -- it scares the crap out of me.
if it's all the same, I'd really rather not talk about it.
wait a minute. What?
you don't want to talk?
you?
there's nothing more to say.
I can't keep explaining myself to you.
I can't make you understand.
why don't you try?
I can't.
because this thing, this blood -- it's not in you the way it's in me.
it's just something I got to deal with.
not alone.
anyway, it doesn't matter.
these powers -- it's playing with fire.
Oh, I had to leave today I'm done with them.
just when I thought I'd found you I'm done with everything.
Really?
well, that's a relief.
thank you.
don't thank me.
I'm not doing it for you.
or for the angels or for anybody.
this is my choice.

what questions?
four individuals hold up a van like pros but leave the dough.
nothing Was stolen but there's a huge reWard.

upstairs?
nothing but the attic up there.
someone's there.
it must be rats.

I'm mad about chicory.
you Were lucky.
you're in shape. - Listen, Ernest,
I'm confused. Why you and Why that day?

we're chatting and having some chicory.
this'll liven it up.
here. - Thank you.

Yes, the Paris police Were there.
that's What you have to say? - Yes.

the neW man in the gang shot Caby.
okay, and?
Caby heard him say something like "bistro."
maybe it means something.
we'll ask him once We catch him.
that's not all.
bonnot stole a ledger belonging to Cagne, the SGED boss.
the man Who offered 100 grand for his capture.
maybe We should ask Mr Cagne a question or tWo.
he's a toff. I'll need the boss's blessing.
is it serious?
no.
I've removed the bullet.
he'll need care but I...
I can't keep him here.

how should I knoW?
ladies and gentlemen, please Welcome my friends President Poincare,
sir LeWis HollingWorth and Casimir Cagne, sponsors of Ivan the Terrible.
inspector Valentin.
this opera marks the daWn of a neW era, a future that We shall build together.
on May 12th this year, We shall meet to make a reality of the deep friendship uniting Russia, Great Britain and France by signing a historic agreement, the Triple Entente.
a treaty that Will make the French rich through our neW government loan.
well done, pal.
you're too hospitable.
london and Paris shelter the scum of Europe and of my country.
the Tsar has his Way of dealing With opponents.
the scum terrify honest citizens in freedom's name.
that's all.
they're brave, risking their lives for a symbol.
madam... Your Highness!
these terrorists. HoW can you...
what symbol?
dogs play a part in the myths around lvan. He...
thank you, my dear. Russian folklore doesn't interest the inspector.
why not? The masses are fascinated, apparently.
those people are hungry.
they're far from home. They cling to What they have left:
their beliefs. They dream of a liberator, a neW lvan.
but I'm here, my love!
my Wife is so fond of protest.
she introduced me to some firebrand...
Jaures?
absurd, just like his rag.
he should be silenced once and for all, I say.
he's a remarkable man.
we'll be honoured to have him at the opera.
music Won't temper his articles.
the press is free.
that's democracy, isn't it?
inspector, it's been a pleasure.
mr President, gentlemen, please folloW me.
madam...
mr Cagne, What did Bonnot and his men steal from you?
pardon me?
100 grand is a lot for a notebook. What Was in it?
you're mad.
I'll refer this to your superiors.
sure...
making neW friends, inspector?
you seem to appreciate him too.
my husband's secretary needs to go over the opera details.
the protocol for his Highness on May 12th.
what did you say?
I asked him to leave us. - No, the last Word.
Bistra. Hurry. Why?
no reason. I'm interested in Russian history, dog's heads, opera...
out of personal interest? - Partly.
may I ask you something?
I'm not going to stop you.
how long have you been married?
five years. Barely three if you count the time spent together.
we travel. I stage the opera.
Really?
does that surprise you? - A little.
I'm sorry. And your husband?
he Works on his project. We try to help Europe's Russians.
someone forgot to tell them.
inspector, your job isn't to like my husband, but to protect him.
I'll do my job. You can keep your great causes.
you don't feel concerned?
I'm a civil servant, not a politician.
sir, your men need you.
thank you. - You're Welcome.
sorry to spoil things.
all hell's broken loose.
bonnot is in Choisy-le-Roi.
Marcel, take over With Achille. Stick With the prince.
especially after tonight's events.
the old fogey's in the Way...
we stay here? - What else?
he's the boss.
great atmosphere!
are you preparing to invade
Alsace and Lorraine?
we're tracking doWn Bonnot. - Good idea.
you must knoW that since you grace us With your presence.
why are you here? - Mr Prefect,
Paris doesn't extend to Choisy. This is my territory.
it Will be settled higher up.
we'll have the press here in an hour.
you Want a turf War in front of them?
a joint operation Would look better.
under your supervision, of course.
give him three men and a sector to shut him up.
a joint operation. I'll choose my sector.

Gilbert!

Pujol! Are you hit?

I'm a famous man. My name is known around the world.
and my renown must fill with envy all those who try so hard to get themselves noticed.
I didn't want much, just to walk with her by the Rhone in the moonlight.
I have always dreamt of such happiness, snatched from me each time.
fire at Will!
I have the right to survive.
since your inane and criminal society prevents that, too bad for it.
too bad for you.
Achille!
don't move. Stay there!
Hey, sonny!
wake up! Are you okay?
collect your Wits.
stay here.
Valentin? It's me.
I don't know about you, but it makes me sore seeing those war pictures.
all about flying leathernecks, and submarine patrols, and frogmen, and guerrillas in the Philippines.
what gets me is that there never was a movie about P. O.W. S......about prisoners of war.
my name is Clarence Harvey Cook - they call me Cookie.
I was shot down over Magdeburg, Germany, back in '43.
that's why I stammer sometimes, especially when I get excited.
I spent two and a half years in Stalag 17.
"Stalag" is German for prison camp.
number 17 was somewhere on the Danube.
there were about 40, 000 P. O.W. S there if you count the Russians, the Poles and the Czechs.
in our compound, there were about 630 of us.
all American airmen, radio operators, gunners and engineers. All sergeants.
now, put 630 sergeants together and, oh mother, you've got yourself a situation!
there was more fireworks shooting off around that joint...
take the story about the spy we had in our barracks.
it was about a week before Christmas in '44.
two of our guys, Manfredi and Jonson, to be exact, were just getting set to blow the place.
animal, Animal! Get up!
Betty Grable's on the phone!
here's your civilian clothes. - OK, Hoffy.
remember, bury your army outfits before leaving the forest.
your compass is the top button of this jacket.
anybody asks for your papers, you're French labourers.
here's your map, Kraut money, Swiss Francs.
let's hear it once more.
we've been over it a hundred times. - Let's hear it again.
we stick to the forest going west till we hit the Danube.
we follow the Danube up to Linz.
in Linz we hop a barge and go to Ulm.
stop it, Joey! Joey, go back to sleep!
go on. You're in Ulm.
we lie low until night, then take a train to Friedrichshafen.
we steal a rowboat, get some fishing tackle and drift south across the lake, till we hit the other side - Switzerland.
once there, give out a big yodel, so we know you're there.
it's a breeze. - Stay out of this.
just one question.
did you calculate the risk?
ready!
you've got ten minutes to get through the tunnel.
you'll come out as the Jerries are changing shifts.
blondie?
OK - Peel off.
show 'em, boys. - Easy does it.
we'll miss you, cruds. - Auf Wiedersehen.
they ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
looks good outside. - I hope they hit the Danube before dawn.
they got a good chance. It's the longest night of the year.
I bet they make it to Friedrichshafen. - I bet they reach Switzerland.
I bet they don't get out of the forest.
what kind of crack is that? - No crack.
two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
enough, Sefton. Crawl back in your sack.
he'd bet on his mother getting hit by a truck!
anybody call? - Sefton, butt out!
wait.
I want to back those kids. I'll cover ten of that. - I'll take five. - Eight.
put me down for ten. - Three.
I'll take one. - I'll cover the whole pot.
anything you say. Cookie...
more cigarettes.
speak up, boys. - I'll cover eight.
here's four.
here's two. - Here's four.
and four more. - I'll cover eight.
give me three. - I bet two.
and a half! - No butts.
no butts, no butts.
will this do or you want more? - That'll do.
speak up, boys. Any more sports in the crowd?
let's go.
those filthy Krauts!
what's left of them, Hoffy? - Don't ask me.
price was elected Security.
OK, what happened? - I wish I knew.
we planned everything to the last detail.
maybe the Krauts knew about the tunnel all the time!
shut up! - Maybe they were laying for them.
hold it, Sefton. I said, hold it!
so we heard some shots. Who says they didn't get away?
anybody here want to double their bet?
every morning at six on the dot they'd have the Appell- that's roll call.
every barracks had its own alarm clock.
ours was Feldwebel Schulz. Johann Sebastian Schulz.
I understand the Krauts had a composer way back with a Johann Sebastian in it.
but I can tell you one thing, Schulz was no composer.
he was a Schweinehund. Was he ever a lousy Schweinehund.
Aw, break it off!
you must get out for roll call! Good morning to you.
OK, everybody, get up, get out!
OK, come on you sack rats. Cut the beefing and get up.
Hey, Schulz.
did you guys have some machine-gun practice last night? - Oh, terrible! Such foolish boys.
such nice boys.
I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
roll call, everybody out.
you killed them? Both of them?
such nice boys. It makes me sick. - Don't wear it out!
you too. Put away that piccolo.
lay off, Schulz. He has a sickness. You know he's krank.
sometimes I think he's fooling us with that crazy business.
would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered over your plane?
come on, Joey. Don't be afraid.
please, gentlemen.
you don't want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning!
Schulz? - Yeah?
sprechen Sie Deutsch?
then droppen Sie dead!
always mit the jokes. Roll call.
wake up, Animal. Come on, Animal, wake up.
good morning, Animal. What would you like for breakfast?
scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny-side up?
griddle cakes! A waffle! - Stop it, Harry. I'm warnin' ya.
coffee! Milk or maybe a little cocoa!
why do you do this every morning?
hamburgers and onions, strawberry shortcake...
I'll kill you, Harry, so help me. - Let go, it's roll call.
Hitler is waiting to see us.
let's see, we have two empty bunks here.
suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little out of decency?
we are cramped for space.
new prisoners coming in everyday.
now, gentlemen, outside, please!
you don't want me in trouble with the Kommandant again?
outside. - Schulz, if you're moving somebody in, how about some Russian broads?
russian women prisoners?
some are not bad at all.
just get us a couple with beautiful glockenspiels.
droppen Sie dead!
all right, men, fall in.
nasty weather we are having?
and I so much hoped we could give you a white Christmas, just like the ones you used to know.
aren't those the words that clever little man wrote, the one who stole his name from our capital, that something or other Berlin.
look at that mud.
I hope you'll still be with us in spring. We shall plant some grass here.
and perhaps some daffodils.
I understand we are minus two men this morning.
I am surprised at you, gentlemen.
here I am, trying to be your friend and you embarrass me.
this could get me into hot water with the High Command?
they would court martial me, after all these years of a perfect record.
you wouldn't want that to happen to me, would you?
fortunately those two men...
as I was saying, fortunately those two men did not get very far.
they had the good sense to rejoin us, so my record stands unblemished.
nobody has ever escaped from Stalag 17.
not alive, anyway.
sergeant Hoffman of Barracks 4. - Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
as Compound Chief, I protest at the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
anything else? - Yes.
under the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners must be given a decent burial.
of course. I am aware of the Geneva Convention.
they'll be given the burial they deserve.
or would you like us to haul in 21 cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a 21-gun salute?
for the last time gentlemen, let me remind you.
any prisoners found outside the barracks after lights out will be shot on sight.
furthermore, the iron stove in Barrack Four, the one camouflaging the trap door, will be removed.
and so the men from this barrack do not suffer from the cold, they will keep warm by filling in the escape tunnel. Is that clear?
all right, then, gentlemen, we are all friends again.
and with Christmas coming, I have a special treat for you.
I'll have you all deloused for the holidays.
and I'll have a little Christmas tree for every barrack. You will like that.
who did this?
I will give the funny man exactly five seconds to step forward.
then you'll all stand here if it takes all day and all night.
that is better.
I see! 600 funny men!
there will be no Christmas trees, but there will be delousing with ice water from the hoses.
dismissed!
we will remove the iron stove, the one that was camouflaging the trap door...
animal, these Nazis ain't kosher. - You can say that again.
these Nazis ain't kosh...
I said you could say it again! That doesn't mean you have to repeat it!
private property.
how come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security?
and the tunnel?
why can't you lay down a belch here without them knowing?
if you don't like how I'm handling this job...
it's got us all spinning.
what makes them Krauts so smart?
maybe they do have radar. Maybe there's a mike hidden somewhere.
Yeah. Right up Joey's ocarina.
maybe they're not so smart, but we're so stupid.
maybe someone in our barracks is tipping them off, like one of us!
you don't say. - Yes, I do say!
one of us is a dirty, stinking stoolie!
is that Einstein's theory or did you figure it out yourself?
Hey! New dames in the Russian compound.
new dames!
new dames in the Russian compound!
Sweethearts! Let's open up the third front!
Hey, dames, how about a little borscht, just the two of us?
Hey, Russki, Russki! Look at those bublichkis!
Hey, look at me! I'm your baby!
get a load of that blonde. She's built like a brick Kremlin.
Hey, Comrade! Here I am!
Harry Shapiro, the Volga Boatman of Barracks 4.
lay off, the blonde is mine!
Hey, Olga, Volga!
wait for me!
let me go! - They'll shoot you!
they'll shoot you, Animal. - I don't care. Let me go!
Chow! Chow!
Chow, Animal, chow!
I don't want to eat. I want to go over there and talk with them.
you don't want to talk to broads with boots on.
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
you want Betty Grable. - Let me go!
Betty Grable.
I told you when the war's over, I'll get you a date with Betty Grable.
how are you going to get me a date with Betty Grable?
we go to California.
my cousin works for the Los Angeles Gas Company.
he'll get the address.
then we go to the house and when she comes to the door, I say, "Congratulations, Miss Grable.
we've voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with.
I'm here to present the award."
what's the award? - What do you think, you're the award!
me?
what if she don't want me?
well, if she don't want you, she don't get nothing.
you're teasing me again.
let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow! - Chow!
are you supposed to drink this stuff or shave? - Drink.
shave.
anyone else want potato soup? - No!
you sure? - Yes!
Chow, chow, where's my chow?
do you have to put your socks in my breakfast?
tough luck.
I hate this life!
set her up, Cookie. I'm starved. - I'm all ready.
easy, Animal! Easy!
where did it come from? - From a chicken, bug-wit.
a chicken? - A chicken lays those things.
don't you remember, Animal?
Hey, it's beautiful.
are you going to eat it all by yourself? - The yellow and the white.
is it all right if we smell it? - Just don't drool on it.
you're not going to eat the shells? - Help yourself.
Thanks. What are we gonna do with it?
we're gonna plant it, Animal, and grow a chicken for Christmas.
if I were you, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like under the barracks.
the coffee looks weak today. - Come on, trader Horn, - what did you give the Krauts for that egg? - 45 cigarettes. The price has gone up.
the cigarettes you took from us last night?
what would I do with them? I only smoke cigars.
the Krauts shot Manfredi and Jonson last night, and today he's trading with them!
this is my last hot breakfast before they remove the stove, so can I eat in peace?
ain't that too bad? Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
he don't have to worry. He can trade for a six-burner gas range.
maybe a deep freeze, too. - So what? Everybody here's trading.
maybe I trade a little sharper. Does that make me a collaborator?
a lot sharper.
I'd like some of that loot you got in the footlockers. - Oh, would you!
my first week here somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Since then I've wised up.
this ain't no Salvation Army, this is dog eat dog.
you stink, Sefton! - Come off it!
now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.
here, Joey.
anything else bothering you, boys? - Yeah, one little thing.
how were you so sure Manfredi and Jonson wouldn't get out of the forest?
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
what's that supposed to mean? - They're lying dead in the mud and I want to know how come.
I tell you how come. Because you said it would be safe, and you gave them the green light. That's how come.
what are you trying to prove? Cutting trap doors! Digging tunnels!
listen, Sefton... - You listen to me!
what do you think the chances are of getting out of here?
let's say you make it to Switzerland. Or say to the States. So what?
they send you to the Pacific. You get shot down again.
only this time you wind up in a Japanese prison camp. That is, if you're lucky.
well, I'm no escape artist.
cigar, Cookie.
you can be the heroes, the guys with fruit salad on your chest.
I'm staying put.
I'm gonna make myself as comfortable as I can.
if I have to trade with the enemy to get some food or a better mattress, that's OK by Sefton.
you crud! This war's gonna be over some day.
then what do you think we'll do to Kraut-kissers like you?
that's enough!
at ease!
break it off down there. At ease for the news.
at ease! Today's camp news.
father Murray announces that, due to local regulations, the Christmas Midnight Mass will be at seven in the morning.
he also says, quote:
you sack rats better show up for services and no bull from anybody." Unquote.
at ease. - At ease!
next.
monday afternoon, a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool.
see Oscar Rudolph of Barracks 7 if you wish to enter a yacht.
all right, at ease! - At ease!
next.
Jack Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank de Notta and Mike Cohen for the pinochle championship.
that's a fix.
all right, at ease! - At ease!
next.
tuesday afternoon at two o'clock all men from Texas will meet behind the north latrine.
all right! At ease! - At ease!
next. A warning from the Kommandant.
anybody found throwing rocks at low-flying German aircraft will be thrown in the boob.
all right. At ease! Are the doors covered?
Yeah, the doors are covered. - Steve, give them the radio.
you can keep it for two days. - We're supposed to have it for a week.
you're lucky to get it at all. The boys are afraid the Jerries will find it. This barracks is jinxed.
we'll take care of it. - Get the antenna. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
get the antenna, get the antenna, get the antenna.
volley got the ball. Volley got the ball...
getting anything? - Too much. I'm trying to unscramble.
if you can't get BBC, how about Guy Lombardo?
are we boring you, Sefton? - Hold it! Quiet!
five Panzer Divisions and nine Infantry Divisions of von Rundstedt's army are pouring into the wide breach.
the Krauts have busted through!
a second German wedge is reported 14 miles west of Malmedy where tank columns cut the road to Bastogne.
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar?
...has driven across Luxembourg.
the Allied Air Force is grounded by poor visibility.
meanwhile, two of Patton's tank units have been diverted towards Bastogne and are trying to...
come on! Come on! - Static!
static is right. The radio's static, Patton's static and we're static!
it's gonna be a longer war than you figured, Duke?
easy, easy.
watch it! Watch it!
well, well, gentlemen, am I interrupting something?
Yeah, Schulz, we were just passing out guns.
guns? You're joking. Always with the visecrackers.
Visecrackers? Where did he pick up his English, in a pretzel factory?
you think I'm a square.
I've been to America. I've been wrestling there.
I wrestled in Milwaukee, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and I will go back.
the way the war is going, I will be there before you.
you should live so long.
here. That's me in Cincinnati.
who's the wrestler with the moustache? - That's my wife.
Hey, look at all that meat. Ain't she the bitter end?
give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Schulz. I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape.
we'll have everything waiting for you in Madison Square Garden.
for the heavyweight wrestling championship of the world.
in this corner, Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus the Hunchback of Stalag 17!
droppen Sie dead!
and now, gentlemen, we'll go outside for a little gymnastics.
we will grab some shovels and undig that tunnel you digged.
schulz, why don't we just plug up the tunnel with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other?
it isn't me. It's the orders. I'm your best friend here.
cut the guff, Schulz, we're on to you!
you know everything that's happening. Who's tipping you off?
tipping me off? I do not understand.
you're wasting your time, Duke. Come on. Let's get it over with.
just a second. Schulz says he's been our best friend here. Maybe he can give us a hint.
come on spill it. How did you get the information?
about Manfredi and Jonson? About the stove and the tunnel?
which one of us is it?
which one of you is what? - The informer?
are you saying one American would inform on another?
that's the general idea. But not so general as far as I'm concerned.
you're talking crazy. - It's no use. Why don't you come clean.
just tell them it's me, because I'm the illegitimate son of Hitler and after the Germans win the war, you're gonna make me the Gauleiter of Cincinnati!
you Americans! You are the craziest people. That's why I like you.
I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas.
down boy!
down boy, down boy!
those poor suckers, Manfredi and Jonson.
they got out of Stalag 17 all right, only not quite the way they wanted to go.
somebody in our outfit was tipping off the Krauts. Only who was it?
the Animal, or Harry, or Hoffy, or Price, or Blondie or Joey, or Duke?
it sure wasn't me. Maybe it was Sefton.
sergeant J. J. Sefton.
it's about time I told you more about that Sefton guy.
if I was a writer, I'd send it to the "Reader's Digest" for one of those "Most Unforgettable Characters You've Ever Met."
he was a big time operator, always hustling, always scrounging.
take, for instance, the horse races.
every Saturday and Sunday he'd put on horse races.
he was the sole owner and operator of the Stalag 17 Turf Club.
he was the presiding steward, the chief handicapper, the starter, the judge, the breeder and his own bookie.
he was the whole works, except I was the stable boy for five smokes a day.
give me Equipoise. Ten on the nose.
ten on the nose.
come on, come on.
ten on Schnickelfritz. - Equipoise.
Schnickelfritz. - Equipoise.
come on, boys. The horses are at the post.
Equipoise? - Equipoise.
ten on Equipoise.
five on Sea Biscuit. I'll pay when the Red Cross parcels come in.
no credit. - Have a heart, Sefton!
sorry, it's against the rules of the Racing Commission.
any more bets? Ready, Cookie?
ready! - Let them go!
and they are off and running at Stalag 17!
come on, Equipoise! Come on, you beauty!
Equipoise! What did I tell you?
don't be no rat! Daddy will buy you some cheese!
let's go!
this way, this way! - Straighten out, you dog!
that's no horse! That's a dervish!
please, please, for Daddy! For Daddy.
the winner is Number Five, Schnickelfritz.
I told you Schnickelfritz! You made me bet on Equipoise!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
you clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
another one of his enterprises was the distillery.
he ran a bar in our barracks, selling schnapps at two cigarettes a shot.
the boys called it the Flamethrower, but it wasn't really that bad.
we brewed it out of old potato peels and sometimes a couple of strings off the Red Cross parcels just to give it a little flavour.
it ain't fair, Harry. I'm telling you, it ain't fair. My Betty!
ain't she beautiful? She married an orchestra leader!
so what? There's other women.
not for me.
Betty!
Betty! - Forget Betty, Animal.
I'll get you a date with some of those Russian women.
you'll get me a date.
sure, I'll get you into the Russian compound.
how? Pinky Miller from Barracks 8 tried to get in over there and they shot him in the leg.
it takes a gimmick, Animal.
I figured us a little gimmick. - You did?
sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
to the Brick Kremlin.
she'll never forgive me. - Come on, Animal.
what are you serving today, nitric acid?
I only work here. Talk to the management.
mr Management! What are you trying to do? Embalm us while we are still alive?
what do you expect? Eight-year-old bottled-in-bond?
all the house guarantees is you don't go blind.
blind? Harry!
Harry, Harry... I'm blind, Harry.
where are you? I can't see. I'm blind, Harry.
I'm blind! - Blind?
how stupid can you get, Animal?
the killer-diller, of course, the real bonanza was when Sefton put up the observatory.
he scrounged some high-powered Kraut lenses and a magnifying mirror, and got Ronnie Bigelow from Barracks 2 to put it together for a pound of coffee.
on a clear day you could see the Swiss Alps.
only who wanted to see the Swiss Alps?
it was about a mile away from that Russian delousing shack, but we were right on top of it.
it cost a cigarette or half a bar of chocolate a peek.
you couldn't catch much through that steam, but after two years in that camp, just the idea of what was behind that window sure spruced up your voltage.
let's go. 20 seconds to a customer.
Hey, Sefton, what's snarling up the traffic? By the time we get to look, they'll be old hags.
simmer down, boys.
there'll be a second show when they put the next batch through.
Hey, Sefton. What's the big idea? Take that telescope out of here!
says who? - Me.
you take it out, but there'll be a riot.
every time they get Red Cross packages, you find a way to rob them.
when they find out, they'll throw us in the boob. - They know. I'd worry about the radio.
maybe they also know about your distillery and horse races.
what makes you and them so buddy-buddy? - Ask Security.
tell him. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Haven't you found out yet?
not yet. - How do you get all these privileges?
I give the guards ten per cent.
and maybe something else! - What?
a little information. - Break it off!
how much more do we have to take from this crud? - There'll be no vigilante stuff while I'm Barracks Chief.
look at them! Those crazy jerks! - They won't get away with it. The Krauts will shoot them!
Harry and the Animal are trying to sneak into the Russian compound!
they're past the 50-yard line! - It's a quarterback sneak!
look at them go!
those idiots will paint themselves right into their graves!
Hello, Bublichki. How are you all?
Hey, the Brick Kremlin! Hey Olga Volga, wait for me!
Hey, Animal, the window.
so life sort of drifted back to normal in Stalag 17.
it was a couple of days before Christmas and everything seemed quiet enough.
but underneath it we knew we were sitting on a barrel of dynamite, and that the stoolie, whoever he was, was ready to strike again any second.
at ease!
all right, at ease! Mail call!
all right, at ease. - Hey, man.
anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
first. The Kommandant is sending every barracks a little Christmas present.
a copy of "Mein Kampf."
all right, at ease. - At ease!
in Oberst von Scherbach's words, "Now that German victory is in sight, "American prisoners must be indoctrinated with the teachings of the Fhrer." Unquote.
in my own words... Unquote.
that's the wrong direction.
give that man a Kewpie doll!
Martin. - Here.
Shapiro. - Yup.
price. - Yeah.
Trzcinski. - Yo.
McKay - Yo!
shapiro, Shapiro, Manfredi...
shapiro, Musgrove. - Hey!
McKay. - Yo!
Peterson. - Yeah!
Plews. - Here.
Pirelli. - Hey!
Coleman. - Yo!
Shapiro. - Nothing for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
shapiro, Shapiro.
Agnew. - Here.
and just what makes you so popular?
it's amazing. 50 million guys running around back home, and all those dames want is Sugar-lips Shapiro.
Plews. - Here.
Bauer. - Here.
McKay. - Yo!
Agnew. - Here.
here, Kuzawa. - Yeah?
give this to Joey? - Is that all the mail?
at ease, at ease!
here's a little something from Father Murray. One to each barrack.
and he wants you to cut out swearing during yuletide.
how did he get those trees? - Prayed, I guess. They grew out of his mattress.
come on, Steve.
Hey! What do we do for decorations?
for that you got to pray yourself.
...and so, Joey, we do hope that you will finish that last year of law school "when you come back home."
law school?
Hey, you don't want to be no stinking lawyer with a stinking briefcase and a stinking office, do you, Joey?
and do keep writing, son. Your letters are very dear to us.
with all our love, Dad."
it's from your Dad, Joey. Here, take it.
next time we write to your folks, you know what you're gonna say?
you're gonna say you don't want to be a lawyer...
that you wanna be a musician, maybe.
like play the flute. Yeah, Joey?
I saw a wonderful article on German prison camps in a magazine.
mom reads a lot.
they showed pictures of the tennis courts, and also say that in winter they freeze them over so you boys can ice skate.
anything about us grouse hunting in the Vienna Woods?
in a way I'm glad you're not in America, with everything rationed here, like gas and meat.
heart-rending, ain't it?
why don't we send them some food parcels?
what do all those broads say? - What do they always say?
let me read one. - It's not good for you, Animal.
Hey, this is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
so it is from the finance company. It's better than no letter at all.
so they want the third payment on the Plymouth.
so they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh...
so they want the Plymouth. - Sugar-lips Shapiro. Amazing, ain't it?
I believe it. - You believe what?
my wife. She says, "Darling, you won't believe it, "but I found an adorable baby on our doorstep "and I've decided to keep it.
you won't believe it, but it's got exactly my eyes and nose."
why does she keep saying I don't believe it? I believe it.
I believe it.
I believe it.
this is it, gentlemen. Don't bother to scrape your shoes.
OK, gang! Meet our new guests.
this is Lieutenant Dunbar and this is Sergeant Bagradian.
lieutenant?
knock it off fellas. The pleasure's all mine.
how are things? - What's doing on the outside?
what's new in the States?
the skirts are shorter, if that's what you mean.
the Lieutenant will be here for a week until the Krauts ship him to the officers' camp in Silesia.
all railroads out of Frankfurt are fouled up. Somebody blew up an ammunition train.
somebody, my eye.
the Lieutenant did it with 50 German guards around.
glad to have you here.
you're in time for the Christmas pageant.
looks more like the lost company of "Tobacco Road."
he's an actor. You should see his imitations. He can do anybody.
do Lionel Barrymore again. - Do Alan Ladd.
do Cary Grant. - Hey, do Grable!
see here Scarlet, I'm crazy about you and always have been.
I gave you kisses for breakfast, lunch, and supper.
and now I find you're eating out. - Not Gable, Grable!
that's enough.
they were shot down two days ago and they've been on their feet ever since.
price will show you your bunks.
fix them some tea.
we had a couple of unexpected vacancies. Upper or lower, Lieutenant?
it doesn't matter. Just so I can get some sleep.
lieutenant Dunbar? - Yeah?
James Schuyler Dunbar from Boston?
Yes. Do we know each other?
he's from Boston, too. But you wouldn't know him unless your house was robbed!
maybe he would. We were gonna be officers together, remember?
only they washed me out. I'm glad to see you made it.
of course your dough had nothing to do with it!
his mother's got 20 million dollars. - 25.
they've got a summer home in Nantucket with a polo field.
put a canopy over his bunk. - Lay off, Sefton!
say, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
lay off, unless you want your head handed to you!
tea is being served on the veranda.
animal, where are the napkins?
do be seated, Bonita. What a perfectly charming table arrangement.
they must have copied it from "House Beautiful."
animal, how many times have I told you?
you always gotta pour from the left.
thank you, James.
don't encourage them. Those are the barrack's clowns.
did they get you over Frankfurt? - On the Schweinfurt run.
flak or fighters? - Fighters.
how many ships did you loose? - About half the group.
flying out of England? - Yes, Waddington. 92nd Bomber group.
how did you blow up the train with 50 guards around?
well, I was just lucky, I guess.
don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.
here's what happened.
we were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, understand?
when an ammunition train arrives the longest ammunition train you ever saw, understand?
he's just giving it a big build-up. It was simple enough.
I went into the men's room, fixed a little time bomb, broke open the window and when the train pulled out
I tossed it into an open car.
there must have been straw on the floor.
Yeah. And about three minutes later you can hear it... boom!
understand? Broke every window in Frankfurt.
understand? It was gorgeous.
wait a second. I'm not through. Understand?
I wouldn't talk about things like that! - They never caught on.
they may. That's why I'd keep my mouth shut.
we're all Americans here, aren't we? - The Krauts are getting information.
especially in this barracks.
how? - That's what we'd like to know.
there's only one pair left. - We'll get some more.
where does a fella take a hot shower around here?
hot shower? Dig him!
no hot showers. You wash in the latrine.
a latrine! - What do you expect, glamour boy?
an officers' club with a steam room and a massage?
you made some cracks before and I let them slide, but I don't intend to take any more.
if you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
look, your dough won't help. Here you're on your own.
no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Let's see how good you swim.
I can swim all right. We own three swimming pools and a private lake.
it figures. Sorry boys, my taxi's waiting.
cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
get ready! Here he comes!
...Czechoslovakia and Poland - kaputt.
and the Frulein with the Glockenspiel - verboten.
and the apple strudel with the Liederkranz- Gesundheit.
everything is Gesundheit, kaputt and verboten!
gentlemen! Attention!
droppen Sie dead!
quiet! We are indoctrinating. Is all you indoctrinated?
is you all good little Nazis?
is you all good little Adolfs?
then we will all salute Feldwebel Schulz.
about face!
one Fhrer is enough.
please, gentlemen, take off those moustaches.
do you want me arrested by the Gestapo?
you would be very sorry to get a new Feldwebel without a sense of humour.
OK, gang. Take off the moustaches. Now, what is it, Schulz?
gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva man will inspect the camp and find out if we are living up to the International Convention.
he will find we are treating you very well.
you must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash.
the Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spick and also span.
Yeah, we'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
the Kommandant also wants every man to have a new clean blanket.
Yeah, we know. We had them last year.
five minutes after he was gone, the blankets were gone.
the Kommandant also told me to pick up the radio.
what radio, Schulz?
the one you are hiding, don't you know?
the one your friend mit-out the leg is smuggling in the compound.
you're off your nut.
give me the radio. - We have no radio.
all right, gentlemen, I'll find it myself.
now, let's see. Where could it be?
maybe, in the Lieutenant's bunk? Oh, no, not in the Lieutenant's bunk.
I'm cold here. Maybe warmer on this side.
in the piccolo, may... Oh, no, not in the piccolo.
am I getting warmer? Hot, maybe?
very hot?
what is this? This is water? - It's a mousetrap.
and this? - My grandmother's earmuffs.
look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown.
how can you win the war mit an army of clowns?
we hope you'll laugh yourselves to death.
Yeah.
now, outside everybody! Everybody out for the blankets.
clear out. Here we go. - Hey, you too, outside. Get going!
hurry up, boys.
that Schulz pig knew where the radio was all the time.
that stoolie is sure batting a thousand.
the guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Anybody seen Sefton?
cookie, have you seen Sefton? - No, I haven't.
here, here!
Hoffy, I'm sorry about the mouse trap, but the war news are very depressing anyway.
I might as well also confiscate the antenna. American know-how.
all right, Cookie. Where's Sefton? - I don't know.
at the Kommandant's? - I don't know.
what did they trade him for the radio? - I don't know.
why don't we look in the footlockers?
you little stooge! Hand over them keys!
I haven't got any keys. - OK, then I'll get me a key.
OK, Hoffy? - OK.
wait a minute. Don't. Sefton will get mad.
of all the hoarding cruds! - Looks like Macey's basement, don't it?
that kid's richer than my mother.
shut up!
for crying out loud. What would he be doing with these?
suppose you ask me? Go on, ask me.
because I got the goods on Mr Sefton. This time he didn't shake me.
take a look for yourself. It will curdle your guts!
the Russian women!
get away!
here, try the end window where the candy is.
come on Hoffy, we all want to see!
how did he get there? - Easy.
through the gate, past the guard like some Kraut Field Marshal.
now we know what he got for the radio.
this is murder!
the stinking miser. Keeping all that for himself!
so I'm a vigilante? What are the barrack's officers gonna do now?
don't worry, Duke. We'll handle it now.
you better handle it fast, before he sells us all down the river.
Hi. Too late for chow?
what's the matter, boys, is my slip showing?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Borscht? - Did you have a good time there?
Oh, somebody was peeking. Yeah, had a dreamy time.
those dames really know how to throw a party.
I've known some women in my time, but...there's nothing like the hot breath of the Cossacks.
there are a couple of blonde snipers over there, real man-killers.
what's this?
what happened Cookie, who did it? - We did it.
there had better not be anything missing. This is private property.
so was the radio private property. So were Manfredi and Jonson.
what about the radio? - Yeah, what about it?
cut horsing around!
we know he's the stoolie and what the pay-off is. Let's get on with it!
let's get on with what?
what is this anyway, a kangaroo court?
why not get a rope and do it right? - You make my mouth water!
you're all wire happy. You've been here too long.
you put two and two together and got four. Only it ain't four!
what's it add up to you, Sefton? - You got the wrong guy.
I'm telling you, the Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barracks.
whatever you do to me, you'll have to do again when you find the right guy.
watch it! The Kommandant!
Achtung! Herr Kommandant!
good evening, Sergeants.
little coffee-klatch you are having?
gloomy in here, isn't it?
where is the Barracks Chief? - Yes, sir.
you have a Lieutenant here. Lieutenant... James Dunbar?
Yes, sir.
I'm Lieutenant Dunbar.
what is your number?
105-353. - That is correct.
lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologise for the accommodations.
ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I'll live.
quite a transportation jam we're having outside of Frankfurt.
they are very angry in Berlin.
they will be angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train.
don't you think so, Lieutenant? - I don't know what you're talking about.
how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I'm OK here, why bother? - No bother.
I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
did you ever try 40 sleeping pills?
we have some rights, Colonel! Why is this man being taken out?
curtains would do wonders for this barrack.
you will not get them.
how did he find out about the ammunition train? - You must have shot your mouths off from Frankfurt to here.
no, we didn't. - Maybe a hint? Think hard.
I don't have to think. We didn't say a word until we hit this barracks.
why are you looking at me?
lights out. Lights out.
I suppose some jerk's gonna say I did it.
why don't you try it one at a time?
now, there's a lot of folks around that don't believe in Santa Claus.
I always did and I always will.
for a while, I thought the German Luftwaffe had shot him down, reindeer, sleigh and all.
but no, sir. On Christmas Eve, the Geneva man showed up with some presents for us.
they brought us coffee, a little sugar, prunes and toothbrushes, and, of all things, some ping-pong balls.
there must have been a slip-up because suddenly we wound up with 2, 000 ping-pong balls.
it seemed pretty idiotic at the time, but those balls sure came in handy.
did they come in handy!
Hey, Schulz!
what is this? You must get out of your bunk.
the Geneva man is coming to inspect the...
lieber Gott, how do you look! You had a fight?
would you like to give Frau Schulz silk stockings for Christmas?
you should see the doctor. Maybe I can... silk stockings?
take them.
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife, but...but there is a piano teacher in the village... - And 200 cigarettes for yourself?
200 cigarettes! What do you want from me?
who's the guy? - What guy?
the one you work with. How do you do it?
I don't want them. - I'll make it 400.
No! No! No!
listen, Schulz, you'd better talk, because I'm gonna find out.
I won't let go. They'll have to kill me to stop me! So talk!
talk what? No, I don't know anything.
how many do you want? 1, 000?
take them!
when the Geneva man comes through the barracks I don't want you to complain to him.
I have orders from the Kommandant to report everyone who complains!
dunbar's being crucified and he's trading again.
didn't you get enough last night? You want more? - Some guys never learn.
here's some ice off the roof. - Beat it, you little stooge!
tell the crum where he stands.
I called a meeting of the Barracks Chiefs this morning.
I thought I could get you transferred to another barracks.
but it turns out nobody likes you any more than we do.
so you're stuck with me?
maybe the Russian broads would take him.
not with that kisser. - You got off lucky last night, Sefton.
one more move, and you'll have your throat cut!
you listening, Sefton?
Yeah, I still got one good ear. Now you listen to me.
two guys in this barracks know I didn't do it.
me and the guy that did do it. It could be any one of you.
you, Hoffy, or Duke, or Price, the Animal, or Blondie, or even Joey.
and he'd better watch out, the guy that left me holding the stick.
if there's gonna be any throats cut in this barracks...
Achtung! Everybody at attention for the Geneva man!
as you were, gentlemen, please.
here we have a typical barrack. It houses 75 men.
every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
the blankets, you will notice are very warm. 50 per cent wool.
they also smell of mothballs. When were they issued? This morning?
what do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove!
the men used it as a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
how long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
here you see a typical meal the prisoners are getting.
what are we having today? - Bean soup mit ham hocks.
would you like to taste it? - Thank you, no.
Where's the ham hock? There should be a ham hock!
when you find it, we'll send it to Geneva.
are there any complaints? Please speak up!
don't be afraid to talk.
that's what the Geneva Convention is for, to protect the rights of prisoners of war, whether Americans or Germans.
what have you got to say? - I like it here.
what about you? - It's all right, considering.
what happened to you? Were you beaten?
why don't you answer? What did you do to this man?
they didn't do nothing.
who beat you? - Nobody beat me.
we were playing pinochle. It's a rough game.
pardon me, sir. Since you want us to speak up.
a man was removed from this barracks last night.
we'd appreciate you looking into it, if they haven't shot him yet.
why was he arrested? - Sabotage. He blew up a train.
they'd have to prove that first.
the Geneva Convention says you can't just shoot a man.
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
of course you did. 26 carloads of munition gone off like a trick cigar.
the SS is running around in circles.
the Gestapo is arresting the wrong people.
and von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
you are being rude again.
I just want to sleep.
9. 30. General von Pfeffinger will be at his desk by now.
shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I didn't do it.
I hope you appreciate this moment, Lieutenant.
you see, I'm a cavalry man. All the von Scherbachs were cavalry men.
well, you know what happened to the cavalry.
just give me five minutes on that couch, will you?
the young ones they put into the panzer divisions.
the older ones in the quartermaster corps or made them recruiting officers or wardens, like me.
wet nurses to putrid prisoners.
in Berlin they have forgotten that Colonel von Scherbach even exists.
but they will remember now.
well... There will be two SS men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin.
you will be interrogated by the General Staff.
when it comes to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I just want to sleep. I haven't slept in three days.
you will remember the name. Scherbach, von Scherbach.
well, Herr Inspektor, how did you find the camp?
crowded, but "gemtlich," shall we say?
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
it is. - What exactly is he charged with?
whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction.
this man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He's a saboteur.
he's a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station.
the train was three miles away when it blew up.
you threw a time bomb.
how could I have had a time bomb?
they searched me when they took me prisoner.
the way you search your prisoners, it sounds rather unlikely.
all I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
I am not! According to the Geneva Convention this man...
is there anything in the Geneva Convention that will let a guy sleep?
you were saying? - Simply this.
after the hostilities are ended, there will be a War Crimes Commission.
if the man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Oberst von Scherbach.
interesting. - Isn't it!
very well. If you insist on details, I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb.
good day, sir. You will forgive me for receiving you like this.
perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
I believe it. I believe it.
let's have your dogtags for the Christmas tree.
what's the idea? You think can eat that stuff?
we're building a smudge pot so Patton can find us when he comes.
20 parts of cellulose, one part phosphorous. Watch.
he'll be able to see our smoke signal four miles away.
but Patton is 400 miles away.
well, I say, be prepared. - OK, boy scout.
Hey, look what we've got! - The phonograph! Music!
put it down here, boys. - We made a deal with Barracks 1.
now, where's that distillery? - Over here, boys.
let's have that distillery.
come on, we swapped it for the phonograph. Any objections, Sefton?
take it.
Hey, Price. Any news on Dunbar?
he's still at the Kommandant's office, that's all I know. Don't worry.
this kid's too good for me.
let's see how good he is. Same stakes?
sure. Go ahead.
that's not bad.
where did you learn your pitching? - From the farmer's daughter.
something I was meaning to ask you about security.
shoot.
we're having a tough time keeping stuff hidden from the Krauts, like our escape equipment.
we're always looking for new devices.
looks like you found one. - Me?
I mean the Lieutenant. He hid a time bomb on him, right?
he even carried it through prisoner's search, didn't he?
where did he hide it? - In his pocket.
the old cigarette-match gag. - What's that?
you take a book of matches, light a cigarette, slip it in.
the cigarette takes about three minutes to burn down.
then it sets off the matches. Simple.
some time bomb.
Hey, that's a ringer.
don't forget the corkscrew.
and have a cigar. - Thanks.
here's a present for you, Joey. - Take it. Take it.
it's Christmas, Joey.
merry Christmas to Joey from the Gang."
open it. - I'll open it for you.
come on, Joey, play.
air raid! Air raid!
everybody out of the barracks! - Not on Christmas Eve!
for your own good, you must get out. And put out those candles.
let's hit the trenches.
I'll bet it's a phoney again. - The Pentagon will hear about this.
get out. - I'm not really built for war.
get out. Everybody in the trenches. Quick.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
you want to get killed? - Not particularly.
Hey, you two. Outside with you!
must you two always be the last? - Yeah? You try jumping in those trenches first.
everybody jumps in on top of you.
how do you think I got my hernia? - Go on, let's go.
so it got to be Christmas Day in Stalag 17.
if you ask me it was more like the 4th of July with all the fireworks that were to go off and bust the camp wide open.
it started off innocently, with a party in every barracks.
come on, Animal, let's trip the light fantastic.
leave me alone.
don't cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive.
snap out of it!
there's a time in every man's life when he wants to be left alone.
so go away.
all right, who wants the Queen of the May?
how about you, Handsome?
you look like Cary Grant. Want to dance with me?
I'd love to, Queenie, but one of the other girls asked me first.
goodbye, darling. Bye.
any cigars left, Cookie?
come on, Cookie, get me a cigar.
what's the matter?
are you on their team now? Do you think I'm the guy?
I don't know what to think any more.
I understand how you feel.
it's sort of rough, one American squealing on other Americans.
then again, Cookie, maybe that stoolie's not an American at all.
maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks.
they do that sometimes.
just put an agent in with us, a trained specialist.
there's lots of loose information floating around a prison camp.
not just whether somebody's trying to escape, but what outfit we were with, where we were stationed, how our radar operates.
could be, couldn't it? - In this barracks?
why not? One of the boys. Sharing our bunks, eating our chow.
right amongst those that beat me up. Except he beat hardest.
who is it? - That's not the point, Cookie.
the point is what do you do with him?
you tip your mitt and the Jerries plant him in some place else like Stalag 16 or 15.
or you kill him off and the Krauts kill off the whole barracks.
every one of us.
so what do you do?
who is it? If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy, or Security?
yeah... Security.
what's keeping Hoffy? Why don't we get news about Dunbar?
he'll be back. They've got no proof.
come on, boys. Soft and sweet.
beguile me.
Betty...
Betty!
may I have this dance, Miss? - Why, sure.
pinch me, darling. Pinch me, so I'll know I'm not dreaming.
thank you, darling.
did anyone ever tell you that you had the most beautiful legs in the world?
but it's not just your legs. I'm crazy about that little nose of yours.
that cute little button of a nose.
Hey, Animal! Animal!
I've been crazy about you for years.
I've seen every picture you ever made... six times!
I'd just sit there, watching you.
I wouldn't even open up the popcorn bag.
animal! Animal! Wake up! Wake up!
Betty! Betty!
animal, this is me, Harry Shapiro!
Harry Shapiro!
Harry...
Harry.
cut the music. Cut the music! Cut it!
at ease! At ease! Somebody cover the doors.
listen! The SS men are here for Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin.
they got proof. Looks like he's finished. - Only not quite yet.
Hoffy and I have figured a long shot. All the barracks are behind us. - What are you gonna do?
blondie, get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
I want everybody out.
we need a lot of commotion in the compound. - I'll get the men from the other barracks.
you think you can snatch Dunbar from the SS?
we're gonna make a stab at it.
Duke, Price, Stosh, Harry, meet at the north latrine. You'll all get your posts.
now everybody start drifting out, one by one.
easy boys, easy. Disperse out there nicely.
remember, just because the Krauts are dumb, it doesn't mean they're stupid.
ready? - Roger.
OK, move out.
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
it may be crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
I guess you're right.
how about me going out and keeping Schulz off balance?
good. - I'd worry about Sefton, not Schulz.
remember me? The stoolie. - You won't squeal this one, brother.
no? Aren't you afraid to turn the stoolie loose on the compound?
for a tip-off like this, what would the Krauts pay?
you'll stay in the barracks, and not a peep out of you!
OK, put a guard on me. I want you to.
because if anything goes wrong, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
right.
so, who's gonna watch me? Cookie? No, not Cookie.
wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
OK, Price, you'll stay here. - What about Schulz?
we'll take care of Schulz. Come on. You, too.
that's the boy, Joey. Play us a little something.
what do you want to hear, Price? "Home On The Range"?
or maybe a little Wagner?
or how about a game of pinochle?
no, you're not a pinochle man.
you're a chess player.
I never knew much about the game.
now, let's see.
a pawn moves this way, and a bishop this way......and the queen moves... every which way, doesn't it?
suppose you sit down and keep your mouth shut!
I went to school with a guy named Price. That was in Boston.
you're from Cleveland, aren't you? - Yeah, I'm from Cleveland.
I thought that was what you said. You're from Cleveland.
you were with the 36th Bomb Group? - 35th. - 35。
the 366th Bomb Squadron out of Chelveston?
are you questioning me?
just getting acquainted. I'd like to make one friend in this barracks.
don't bother. I never liked you and I never will.
many people say that and then they get married, and live happily ever after.
I wonder what they're trying to do.
where was Dunbar? The Krauts went crazy looking for him.
they herded us out, put extra machine guns on us and gave us a picture check.
you know, checking our dogtags and our pans against their index file.
nobody except Hoffy knew where Dunbar was hidden. And he wouldn't tell us.
the Krauts searched under the barracks, on the roofs, even the Kommandant's bathroom, but no Dunbar.
then they threw tear gas bombs into the barracks in case he was hiding up in the rafters.
then they made us stand for six hours out there until von Scherbach came out and gave us his ultimatum.
if Dunbar didn't come out by next morning, he'd tear down the whole compound, stick by stick.
and if we slept in the mud for the rest of our lives, that was OK by him.
he couldn't figure how a guy could disappear from the compound and still be there.
but Dunbar was there all right.
he sure was there.
let's have it understood. This will be a rough deal. But we've got no choice.
one of us will take Dunbar out of the camp tonight.
we'll draw one dogtag to see who does the job.
the Krauts are expecting it and they've put on extra guards.
now, if anybody wants to withdraw, speak up.
then we're all in on it.
everybody but Joey, and you know who.
all right, who's the lucky one?
let me do it, Hoffy.
you want to go? - No, I just want to draw.
OK, draw.
let's call this my tag. I'll take him out.
no volunteers. We're all in on it.
you elected me Security.
the way things have been going I've done a poor job and want to make it up. Am I asking too much?
we've all done a poor job. - I still say this is my tag.
any objections, Hoffy?
any objections? - Not from me. - He can have it.
who are we to argue with a hero? - How about me latching on?
three's a crowd, especially if you've got to go through barbed wire.
let's have the wire cutters.
are the civilian clothes ready? - Coming up.
get to work on the trap door.
what do you say, Hoffy? We hit the trenches then cut out back at Barracks 9?
you'd better cut out back of the south latrine.
why the south latrine? - Because he's there. In the water tank.
good spot.
with any luck we may be in Krems by morning.
maybe even catch a barge up to Linz.
two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
are you starting that again?
anybody cover? - Somebody step on that crum.
we warned you. - Sure you warned me.
you were gonna slit the throat of that stoolie.
here's the knife to do it with.
make sure you get the right throat. - We're looking at it.
hurry up on that trap door. Are you trying to gum up the works?
would you rather see Dunbar lying in the mud like Manfredi and Jonson?
my hands were full keeping these guys from tearing you apart.
I called it last time, didn't I?
are we going to listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
they know where Dunbar is.
how do they know? - You told them, Hoffy.
who did? - You did.
are you off your rocker? - Fell right on my head.
sprechen Sie Deutsch? - No, I don't "Sprechen Sie Deutsch."
maybe just one word? Kaputt? Because you're kaputt!
get him out of my hair so I can go.
to the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
I'll kill you for that!
shut up! Security officer?
always screening everybody. But who screened you?
great American hero, from Cleveland, Ohio, enlisted right after Pearl Harbour.
when was Pearl Harbour or don't you know?
december 7th, '41. - What time?
six o'clock. I was having dinner.
six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.
am I boring you, boys? - Go on.
he's a Nazi, Price is! For all I know, his name is Preissinger or Preisshoffer.
sure he lived in Cleveland, but when war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist.
he spoke our lingo. They sent him to spy school and gave him with phoney dogtags.
he's just trying to get off the hook!
he said, "shut up." - You heard what he said.
OK, Herr Preisshoffer, let's have the mailbox.
the what?
the one you took out from the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
I'll show you how they did it.
they did it by mail. - Mail?
that's right. Little love notes between our security officer and von Scherbach with Schulz the mailman.
here's the flag.
they used to put a loop in the cord. Did you ever notice?
and here's the mailboxes. Hollow black queens.
cute.
they delivered or picked up the mail when we were out of the barracks, like for appell.
when there was a special delivery they'd pull a phoney air raid, to get us out, like last night, for instance.
there wasn't a plane in the sky. Or was there, Price?
brother, were we all wet about you?
forget it.
what are we gonna do with him? - Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.
let's have that civilian stuff.
I'll look pretty stupid in this, yodelling my way across the Alps.
now, let's have the wire cutters.
you taking Dunbar? - You bet!
there ought to be some reward money from Mama. About 10, 000 bucks.
I told you boys I'm no escape artist.
for the first time, I like the odds, because now I got a decoy.
what's the decoy?
price!
when I go, give me exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank.
then throw Price into the compound, nice and loud.
he'll draw every light from every goon tower.
it's our only chance to cut through.
what do you say, Barracks Chief?
he's right, Hoffy, it's either Price or Dunbar.
he killed Jonson and Manfredi, didn't he?
it's all yours.
what's the matter, Price?
you said you were going to save Dunbar? Now's your chance.
so long, Cookie. You can have the department store, what's left of it.
so long, Sefton.
you're not disposing of those Russian broads, are you?
tell you what to do. Get 100 cigarettes for the Kraut guards.
then get yourself another face.
you could use a new one too.
let's synchronise the watches.
it's 11. 42 sharp.
check.
just one word.
if I ever run into any of you on a street corner, let's pretend we never met before.
shut up the moaning. You'll have the machine guns on us.
turn it off, Lieutenant.
my legs are... frozen.
you'd better get that blue blood circulating 'cause we're busting out of this stink hole in exactly one minute and 20 seconds.
Sefton! - Did you expect a St. Bernard dog?
not you! - Want some brandy?
Yeah. - Who doesn't?
suppose we wait till we hit the Waldorf Astoria?
OK. It's on me. - You won't get off that cheap.
what are our chances of busting out of here?
we'll know in about 40 seconds.
hold his leg up.
just in case your Kameraden are hard-of-hearing.
30 seconds. Get him up.
stop shaking, Price. There'll be no pardon from no governor.
funny, ain't it? In your own Fatherland, by your own Soldaten.
the kid's got no sense of humour.
20 seconds. Open the hatch.
what's the matter with you, Security? You were always so calm.
especially when you let Manfredi and Jonson go out there.
eight seconds, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, go!
this is it!
let's blow, Chauncey. - Let's.
all right, men. Everybody back in their bunks... like nothing happened.
what do you know? The crud did it.
I'd like to know what made him do it.
maybe he just wanted to steal our wire cutters.
did you ever think of that?
what's going on tonight?
we're meeting at Tara's at midnight.
her parents are in Cabo.
I can't. I'm babysitting my brother.
mom is on a date with a stockbroker.
she's aiming high.
my mom is dating a yogi who only eats raw.
Thomas, you better be in that bed.
I will tell mom.
I think my brother is up.
Ah, it he really.
damn it, Thomas.
that's weird.
what?
I heard something.
what is it?
maybe it's your stalker.
no one believes me.
I swear someone has been following me around.
they were lurking in the back yard last week.
you don't have a stalker.
famous people have stalkers.
you have a creeper with a crush.
that qualifies as a stalker.
chill out, Hannah.
don't flatter yourself.
what's going on?
I heard something. Don't hang up.
OK. I'm here.
talk to me, Hannah.
Hannah, you're scaring me.
Hannah, what's going on?
I don't know.
Hannah, what's going on?
the door is open.
are you serious?
do you see anything?
I think someone is in the house.
Oh my god, get out of there.
I can't. I can't leave without Thomas.
if anything happens, call 911.
Thomas, where are you?
what are you doing, trying to scare me to death?
there's someone in the house.
talk to me. What's happening? Hannah?
I'm calling the police.
Yes, yes. Call the police. I don't know what to do.
get out of the house, Hannah, now!
get out of the house!
Oh, my god, he's in the house!
help! Help! Help!
somebody help us!
help!
a peck or a kiss?
a longish kiss.
he wanted it to go further, but it was late, and I had to open up this morning.
you gonna see him again?
no. He was nice, but there was no chemistry.
but you had fun.
how'd you sleep?
Great...no psycho dreams,
no Bob standing over the bed trying to strangle me.
because he's in prison and he will never hurt you again.
I know.
look. Keep dating. Keep it light.
have fun. Have crazy sex.
crazy sex?
Yeah. - Yeah.
who are you having crazy sex with?
do as I say, not as I do.
seriously, I've known you 3 years.
unless you're keeping them all a secret...
hang on.
how does your phone know how to do that?
it's freaky.
hello.
Yeah. Tell him I'll call him back.
Thanks. I'm out.
I'm here all night.
remember, have fun.
have fun.
can my friend pick me up?
can my friend pick me up?
Yeah.
love you. All right.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
call Turner at L.A.X. and confirm they closed the file on the September threat.
let's put it to bed.
morning. Coffee?
Hey, Jack. I'm good.
how about you, um...
belle. No, thank you.
I'm good.
you sure?
I'm good.
Weiss called to follow upon the Lopez case.
erotomania, guy who was obsessed with the soap star...
morning. I brought coffee.
I went all L.A. with nonfat, nondairy quad shot lattes.
did I get close?
Oh, well, thank you.
Jack, don't buy me coffee.
Seriously? You're gonna get mad at coffee?
I'm just trying to make a good impression, my ongoing struggle.
you want to make a good impression?
don't barge into my office and interrupt me.
Wow! You're tough. OK. I'll just be at my desk.
do I even have a desk?
here. I'll show you.
we're a small setup.
we have 6 detectives in the unit and an assistant--Belle.
what about all the other people?
various.
there's vice, domestic violence, mental health.
it changes.
people get moved around a lot, and space is tight.
6 detectives handle all the stalker cases in L.A?
and any other threat that occurs.
so a lot of what we do is consult and assist other departments.
so playing nice is essential.
Beth wants you up to speed. Here are the active files.
we handle around 300 cases a year with 20 to 30 ongoing.
happy reading.
what's his rank?
he's young, D1, a bit disgruntled.
he doesn't seem disgruntled.
he smiles a lot.
he's faking, lots of repressed hostility.
Beth keeps him trapped behind the computer.
great cyber tech, but he wants to be in the field, which is why he resents you.
he doesn't appear to resent me.
he's faking.
if you're wondering, I'm D2 with a background in sociology and clinical psychology.
we all have our own skill set.
so what's my skill set?
you come from New York homicide.
you tell me. So why L.A?
looking for a change. What about you?
how long you been here?
I'm an Orange county native. Single or married?
something tells me you know the answers to all these questions.
just small talk. Never mind.
and Chai Tea.
I usually drink chai tea in the morning, but thanks.
the gesture worked for me.
Janice, you free?
responding officers called about a home invasion in Larchmont.
they want us to assess. Jack, let's go.
you're tailing.
I'm Ron. I live next door.
I was out walking Cheeky here when, bam,
Hannah ran right into me, probably scared me more than I scared her.
and none of you saw or heard anything out of the ordinary last night?
just Hannah screaming. I live across the street.
I was watching Letterman, and I called the police.
I live right around the corner, out like a light. Sorry.
and then we ran out of the house and into Ron.
he called 911, and that was it.
Ron is your neighbor?
Yeah. He was out walking his dog.
by the time the cops came, whoever it was was gone.
is anything missing in the house?
no, not that my mom and I could tell.
in your statement, it says you believe someone is following you.
Yeah.
every once in a while, I feel like someone is watching me.
I'll turn around, but then no one is there, and it's really freaky, you know?
I can feel it, and then somebody the last couple of weeks has been in the back yard.
they've been wearing a hoodie or something.
Hannah, why didn't you tell your mom?
she works a lot, and I didn't want to worry her.
besides, who's gonna believe me?
I mean, it's not like I have proof or anything.
I believe you, Hannah. All right.
here's what I want you to do.
I want you to write down every time you remember someone watching you
what day it was, what time it was, anything that can help us identify your stalker's patterns.
but I've never even seen his face.
I know, but your instincts become my clues.
a timeline will really help us.
stalking usually begins with a benign crush or a fixation, and it escalates into something that becomes more frequent.
as the obsession grows, so does the stalker's courage and his need to reach out.
Hannah, don't worry, all right?
we're gonna find out who's doing this.
it's just the two kids.
Hannah is 16, and Thomas is 7.
Hey, buddy.
you like my shirt?
that's cool. What is that?
it's a platypus.
platypus.
no, honey. Honey, give the detective some room.
he's ok.
is that yours?
Tom built that for Hannah when she was 10.
no one goes up there anymore.
when did your husband pass?
3 years ago.
it's been tough.
I. D. this.
you got it.
can't find any fingerprints.
nothing seems to be missing. What about you?
there's a boot print in the flower bed.
from the depth and width, could be a man's size 10, more voyeur evidence in the tree house.
what do you think?
he's following her, spying on her.
it's predatory, sexual.
stalking is just foreplay.
the real goal is sexual assault.
Ben got a hit off the xxx database.
thaddeus Barnes--convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl, got out 6 months ago, lives 4 blocks away.
Mr. Barnes, where were you last night?
I was here.
took a walk around ten and then to bed.
what's this about?
we're investigating a break-in.
a teenage girl was victimized.
Oh, I see.
some little girl complains about the bogeyman, so it's got to be me, right?
we'd like to come in, take a look around.
do you have a warrant?
no. I have your probation officer.
I'll let him explain the law to you.
excuse me.
that's Hannah Mccoy.
they're just pictures.
fetishizing young girls.
it's not illegal or a violation of my probation.
I stay 100 yards away from schools, parks, libraries.
I don't talk to anyone under 18 ever.
what do you know about her?
nothing.
seen her around.
you in her neighborhood a lot?
it's a free country. I like to walk.
apparently past the houses of underage girls like Hannah.
sweet and young, cute--that's your type, right?
I'm better now.
there is no cure for a child predator. We both know that.
but there is treatment...
cognitive, behavioral.
I've developed coping skills to change and curb my impulses.
I look.
I don't touch.
what's your shoe size?
10 1/2. Why?
we found a boot print under Hannah's window.
right now, SID techs are going through your closets trying to find a match.
you'd save us a lot of time...
you can't railroad me. Look.
I know I have a problem, and I am handling it the best way I know how.
any further questions will be answered in the presence of my lawyer.
Hey, thanks for coming so quickly.
Yeah. I got your message, and I got the warrant granting you access to Barnes' hard drive.
great. Oh, sorry.
this is Jack Larson. He's new to the team.
deputy D. A. Amanda Taylor.
nice to meet you.
I'll call Barnes' P. O. get him to sign off on a probation hold.
good. That'll give you24 hours to find something solid.
great.
this is awkward.
I didn't realize you worked TAU cases.
Amanda, hold on a second.
you are something else. You know that?
listen. The whole reason I lobbied for TAU was because I thought you worked robbery homicide.
that's where you're listed in the D. A.'s office.
a Beatrice somebody handles TAU.
she's on maternity leave. I'm covering for her.
look. I don't want this to be weird.
it's not weird. It's despicable.
let's just talk for a sec, work this out.
do you mind?
I just spent the last 3 hours at Hannah's high school.
I was expecting this whole flashback scenario.
who are those people?
did Hannah have any conflicts with other students?
counselors, friends all say Hannah is a good girl...
no trouble, smart, high GPA, doesn't date.
there are no boys in the picture, which is weird.
Why?
because she's a little hottie tottie.
and little hottie totties always have a guy.
what is that?
the evidence from Barnes' laptop.
man, this guy took a lot of photos.
LAPD threat assessment unit.
one moment.
can I help you?
I'd like to speak to Lieutenant Beth Davis.
your name?
am I interrupting?
this is so wrong.
how does this not violate his probation?
it's not defined in his paperwork.
I mean, technically, he can take all the personal photos he wants in a public setting.
are we sure Barnes is our guy?
what do you mean?
according to his original arrest report,
Barnes was a kindly neighbor.
he let the local girls play in his yard, even bought them a trampoline
until one day, he drugged a girl's lemonade and raped her.
so he doesn't like confrontation.
so why break into a house?
I mean, it seems too brazen.
pedophiles are like addicts.
rarely do they change their M.O.S.
that was forensics.
none of Barnes' shoes were a match for the boot print in the Mccoys' flower bed.
I'm telling you, I mean, this Barnes is a bad dude, but is he the guy we're looking for?
Hannah said someone was following, someone in a hoodie, size 10 1/2 boot, he sat in the tree house watching.
do we have pictures of the house from the tree's point of view?
the tree's point of view? Is the tree a suspect?
is this the hostility you were talking about?
what are you doing here, Perry?
I didn't come here to rat you out or anything if that's what you're worried about.
I'm not worried.
Really?
because you assaulted me in a parking lot.
I have no recollection of that.
what do you want?
sorry. I didn't come here to be contentious.
I wanted to tell you that it was wrong of me to harass Eric.
I won't be contacting him anymore.
I heard you loud and clear.
good. I'll hold you to it.
if that's all...
help me.
I mean, I...
I need help. I know it.
you know it?
how?
I fixate.
I can't explain it, but there this part of me in my head that causes me to focus on someone, and then it takes over.
I want to know them. I want to be with them.
it's like a drug, and then the obsession fuels me.
it makes me matter.
there's something wrong with me.
if you want help, Perry, call this man.
he's a therapist.
he can help you if you're serious.
thank you.
no direct POVs.
I went up the tree, and I can see directly into the living room.
there's a view of the couch and the TV.
Hannah is on the phone, watching Survivor.
Oh, look who got voted off the island.
I always hated that creep.
I'm starving.
I see the kitchen, the fridge.
she goes for some string cheese.
dude, what are you doing?
he's role playing.
what's going on?
he likes to role play.
I follow you around.
I sit and watch you watch TV, but how does that trigger me to break into your house?
she goes to her bedroom.
you watch her undress, go to bed, sleep.
that would escalate to violence.
but Hannah's bedroom is on the other side of the house.
right. Wait, wait, wait.
there's a window on the right side of the house.
whose room is that?
Thomas' bedroom.
what if Hannah isn't the target?
Hannah made a journal of every time she felt followed.
where is it?
daycare, store, playground.
thomas was with her every time.
we have the wrong victim. It's Thomas.
Hello?
Hello, Mrs. McCoy. This is Lieutenant Davis.
Yes, Lieutenant Davis?
is Thomas OK?
Yeah. He's fine.
he's watching a movie downstairs.
OK. I don't mean to scare you, but I need you to check on him right now.
what's this all about?
we think the person who broke in might have been there for Thomas.
mom...
Thomas, baby, where are you?
Oh, my god.
baby?
Thomas--he's gone. He's not here.
give me photos.
run any prints you find immediately.
he's only 7.
he's never spent the night away from me.
we're gonna find him, I promise.
how do you know that?
don't say that. Don't do that.
don't say things you don't know.
she said it because she does know it.
we're gonna bring Thomas home safe and sound.
what's that?
Thomas' squirt gun.
no. That's not his.
I don't allow guns of any kind in this house.
have you seen this before?
no.
what are you doing?
we talked to your guidance counselor.
you're a good girl, Hannah...
smart, lots of friends, no boyfriend, though, which I find odd since you're so pretty and sexy with your little crop tops and your tattoo.
no judgment, mind you.
I think you're good.
I just don't think you're innocent.
you're a responsible girl.
I'm guessing that we're gonna find within arm's reach.
what's this?
that is none of your business.
again, no judgment.
who are you having sex with, Hannah?
what's his name or shoe size, huh?
this has nothing to do with Thomas.
right now, everything has to do with Thomas.
I need a name, Hannah, now.
you're Victor Sweeney?
you work in a tattoo parlor on Lankershim?
Yeah. What's this about?
you did her tattoo, right, been over her house a couple times?
not that I remember.
you recognize this toy gun?
no? Your boots have a very specific tread.
a lot like this print that we found under Hannah's bedroom window.
OK. So I was there. So what?
so you're in a relationship with Hannah, and her brother was abducted this afternoon.
can you account for your whereabouts today, Victor?
I was at home asleep.
wait. You don't think I had something to do with this.
you kept your relationship with Hannah a secret.
maybe Thomas found out.
maybe you wanted to shut him up.
that's crazy.
you have a rap sheet, Victor, mostly petty crimes...
vandalism, drunk and disorderly.
a 28-year-old guy with a 16-year-old girl?
that's statutory rape.
it wasn't like that, I swear.
I gave Thomas the squirt gun as a present.
he was a nice kid. I would never hurt him, never.
Hannah mentioned a stalker.
you were creeping around that house at night.
you must have seen something.
once a couple weeks ago...
it was pretty late... and then again last week.
I was leaving her house, and there was a car parked down the street, and I could see someone in the driver's seat, and they were just staring at Hannah's house.
so I figured it had to be the guy.
you see his face?
no. He was wearing a hoodie, and when I came at him, he screeched off.
what kind of car? What color?
I don't know, man.
think!
what kind of car? What color? Come on.
it was silver or gray, maybe a sedan.
and you withheld this information why?
you know why.
come on. I'm being straight with you guys.
tattoo guy said he saw a silver or gray sedan parked in the neighborhood.
I searched through the pedophile's pictures and found this.
I checked DMV, and it belongs to Rosemary Wilson, the McCoys' neighbor.
I interviewed her.
find her now.
we're here, James.
we're home.
I want my mommy.
Aw, honey, mommy is right here.
Oh, you look so sleepy. Did you have a nice nap?
you shouldn't have drunk all that cough syrup.
you know it's not like candy, sweetie.
I'll be right back.
don't you go anywhere.
No! Please! No!
No!
who are you...
and what the hell are you doing in my house?
who are you...
and what are you doing in my house?
look. If you don't get out...
they searched Rosemary's house.
it's her. They found this.
the place looked like she left in a hurry,
hasn't been seen since yesterday.
what about the APB on her car, the Amber alert?
there has to be something.
I just checked.
Thomas' photo is everywhere.
we've received over two dozen calls.
nothing is panning out.
that was the real Rosemary Wilson.
apparently, her sister Judith Ann is who we're looking for.
so Rosemary has been using her sister's identity?
do a search on Judith Ann Wilson.
the real Rosemary lives in Seattle.
seems Judith has problems.
she's stolen her sister's identity more than once, thinks people are out to get her.
sounds like paranoia.
or psychotic delusion.
apparently, Judith hasn't been the same since her son died.
Judith Ann Wilson gave birth to a son James Peterson at Good Samaritan Hospital 9 years ago.
according to his death certificate,
James Peterson drowned two years back, ruled accidental.
so Thomas would be the same age her son was when he died.
that could've triggered her fixation.
she's looking for a replacement.
OK. So where did she take Thomas?
is there a father listed?
Derek Peterson, accountant, lives in the south bay.
you think she's trying to put her family back together?
or he might know where she took him.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could help, but I haven't seen Judith since we divorced.
which is right after your son died.
Yes, but things weren't good between us before that.
she was...
impulsive?
emotionally unstable?
one minute, she hated me. The next was total love.
she had problems.
Mr. Peterson, do you have any idea where she might have gone?
I'm sorry. I don't.
I understand your son was 7 when he drowned.
he and Judith were in a rowboat on Echo Park Lake.
James fell in.
but you're not so sure that's what happened.
of course I am. It was a terrible accident.
according to her medical records,
Judith was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder in her 20s.
Yes, but she was very good at keeping upon her medication.
and you filed for divorce 6 weeks before James died?
how did she take the news?
not well.
she lashed out, became depressed.
it's possible she blamed James for the demise of your relationship.
if you're suggesting that Judith had anything to do with...
you're in denial, Derek.
you don't want to think she could hurt your son because that would mean you weren't there for him as a father.
but you know the truth, don't you, Mr. Peterson?
I thought, but there was never any proof.
who would do something like that?
maybe she was desperate to save her marriage, and when that didn't work out, all she had left was guilt.
seeing Thomas brought back the ghost of James.
it eased the pain, a psychotic delusion brought on by a repressed memory.
which fueled her obsession.
Mr. Peterson,
where were you and Judith living at the time?
a couple blocks from where he drowned.
address?
1217 Terrace Drive.
shut up!
Oh, quiet, James.
you know how much mommy hates it when you cry.
shut up!
I said shut up! Look at me.
she's in there. So is Thomas.
you take the front. I'll take the back.
I have an idea.
Hello? Hi.
sorry to barge in. The door was open.
I'm your neighbor Beth from down the street.
H-hoping I could borrow a cup of sugar.
I'm attempting to bake, and I ran out.
this your son?
James. He's such a cutie.
looks just like you.
thank you.
it's Judith, right?
is it? Yes.
Yes. It is, but you can call me Judy.
all my friends do.
which house did you say you lived in?
just across, two doors down.
is it sugar that you said you wanted?
Yeah, just a cup.
the recipe requires two.
Thomas, run.
No!
James, baby! James!
James, where are you?
baby!
I'm not your son. Go away.
Thomas? Thomas, it's the police.
Where's Judith?
Thomas, unlock the door.
I don't know you.
Yeah, you do. We met at your house.
I'm gonna take you to your mom's.
open the door, buddy.
you ruined my life, James.
drop it! Now!
it's OK, it's OK.
it's all right. Everything is ok, Jack.
Judy, it's me, your friend.
you don't want to hurt James.
you love him, remember?
Judith, don't do this. This is Thomas McCoy.
it's not James. Thomas is not James.
James is gone.
no. - Yes.
Yes.
you can trust me.
I'm gonna get you the help you need, all right?
it hurts.
it won't stop hurting.
I like you.
what?
I don't care if you don't like me.
I like you.
you are one awkward dude.
want to grab a drink and bond some?
strictly platonic, for the most part.
is it ever platonic?
if I go to drinks with you and get even the slightest bit buzzed,
I'm gonna turn into that guy because you are a really hot woman.
so please don't take this the wrong way.
I've been that guy.
I don't want to be that guy, not here at work with you.
I'd like to keep things clean.
you mind if we don't?
it was just drinks, Jack.
it's never just drinks, Janice.
wow, did he just reject you?
that's got to hurt.
on the contrary.
he just got more interesting.
we never got a chance to finish our conversation.
so let's finish it. Go.
I know I hurt you.
I know you'll never forgive me.
I wouldn't even ask you to, but I'm not here to ruin your life, either.
I just...
I just want the chance to know my son.
I don't want you to know him, Jack.
you're not worthy of him. Do you understand that?
I would never hurt him.
famous last words, Jack.
now it's my turn, so listen up.
you have two weeks to get out of L. A.
put in for a transfer. Quit. Go back to New York.
I don't care, but if you do not leave,
I will go to Beth and your division captain and I will tell them that little thing that I know and nobody else does, and it will ruin you.
now, I know you care about your career.
in fact, it's the only thing that you care about.
so don't be stupid.
I repeat, two weeks.
can I get a Manhattan.
you look pretty young. Can I see some I. D?
you got something against younger men?
no, no.
Cara, Cara baby. Cara, Cara.
a lot of uniforms here.
Janice told me this was an open case, but I didn't get all the details.
is the victim a cop?
daughter of one. Jimmy Lambert, Lieutenant downtown.
detective Wilkes.
my team's first on the scene.
this case started with you, so if you could prep my men here.
it's still my case, Trent.
of course, and we're going to assist you, ok?
it's one of our own, Beth.
all hands on deck.
how's Cara?
not good.
bullet passed right through her skull. She's in surgery.
you find the slug?
still searching.
you identify where the shot came from?
rooftop across the street to the west here.
you sure?
that's not an easy shot.
I'm sorry. Who -- who are you?
Jack Larsen. New guy.
Trent Wilkes, robbery homicide.
Jack just transferred to TAU.
OK. Yeah. I'm sure the shot came from that rooftop.
we found a sniper's nest.
he also left some fibers behind from a screening mesh.
mesh? - Yeah.
that's what military snipers use to camouflage their locations.
right. Looks like he was perched there for hours just waiting, hiding.
prints, DNA?
no, New York. I would have led with that.
also no surveillance footage.
this guy's really good at avoiding cameras.
anything you need, Beth.
what's his deal?
Why?
get a weird vibe.
it's you. You make bad first impressions.
do I? Every time?
maybe I suck. Do I suck?
the victim is Cara Lambert, 24.
tau was called in two years ago when her jock ex-boyfriend Paul Watson decided he was gonna stalk her during their senior year of college.
he didn't take kindly to the fact that she left him to pursue women.
that had to hurt if the guy has a fragile ego.
right. Well, there's an APB out.
full manhunt's in effect. We got to go. We have work to do.
any word?
no. She's still in surgery.
you were supposed to protect her.
you told me I could trust you.
you're not helping things, Jimmy.
I'm sorry.
tell that to my baby.
she came to you for help.
come on, come on.
you said you'd handled this. - Come on.
paul was there. I saw him.
at the wedding?
a couple hours before the ceremony.
I saw him in front of the hotel.
he saw me, and he ran scared. I thought that would be it.
he's not gonna get away with this.
we'll find Paul. Let us do our jobs.
I did that, and now my baby is on an operating table.
while we're looking for Paul, is there anyone else we should be looking at?
you've got one job, lady--find Paul!
they got to go by the numbers. You know this.
anyone else you and Cara had a run-in with?
no.
why are you still here?
you're a cop, lieutenant. You can't tell me you haven't pissed some people off.
any perps with grudges or someone you arrested recently, anything like that?
why is he talking...
me and Jimmy used to ride together.
the boys back at the station are going over our caseload.
we'll reach out to them.
I'm telling you it was Paul.
a couple weeks ago...
a couple weeks ago, Cara said that she thought she was being followed.
did she see anyone?
no.
why didn't you say something to me?
we didn't want to believe it.
we thought it was all behind her.
let's take a walk. Come on.
I thought she was joking.
gay? How -- how was that even possible?
we were doing it regularly, and I'm telling you, man.
she liked it.
is that why you put that tape of you two having sex online?
nice try.
no. I didn't post it.
I'm not sorry that it's out there.
the dudes on my team were saying that I turned her gay.
now they can see that I was laying it down right.
he was texting me and calling me all through the night, so I turned my phone off, and then at 2: 00 in the morning, the fire alarm went off in my building.
I went outside, and there he was just staring at me.
did he threaten you?
no, but he had this look in his eyes I had never seen before.
it was like he hated me.
I need you to leave her alone.
I need her to understand that she can't play games with me.
she's not playing games, Paul.
she likes girls. She's not interested in you-- Then why was she with me in the first place?
your feelings are hurt.
no. I just don't like being lied to.
she doesn't get to do that to me.
has he ever been violent?
no.
but I can feel it.
what - what can you feel, Cara?
he wants to kill me.
what do you think?
this Paul guy is not winning me over.
patrol's sitting on Paul's apartment.
the guy's missing.
S.I.D. recovered the slug from the crime scene. They're running ballistics.
we retrieved Cara's stalker diary from her apartment.
after the restraining order was put in place, there was very little contact with Paul, but there are a couple of recent entries where she states that she feels like she's being watched, but she wasn't sure it was Paul.
did PD recover Paul's laptop from the apartment?
Yeah. I'm still going through it,
but the browser history shows that he was looking at Cara's wedding announcement in the "L. A. Times" a couple days ago.
that could have been the trigger that reignited his obsession.
I did the assessment. Paul was a howler.
I mean, he made e-mail threats, he texted her, wanted attention, but there was never any history of violence,
no mental health issues, no other legal misconduct.
the victim's father encountered Paul at the wedding locale this morning.
you're saying I missed it?
no. I'm not saying that.
that's what it sounds like. - That's what you heard.
I didn't say that.
we get over 300 cases a year with a 56% recidivism rate.
you know how many of those freaks go south without warning?
can we just find Paul Watson?
we're reaching out to friends, family, anyone that might know his whereabouts.
paul modified his behavior in response to the restraining order.
he was afraid of jeopardizing his future.
this doesn't add up.
the shooter sat in a nest for hours, waiting to take one single shot.
that takes training and precision.
did Paul have experience with guns? Was he a military boy?
no. He grew up in Colorado hunting. That's it.
the attack was covert.
that requires discipline. It was unemotional.
it doesn't fit Paul's harassment pattern.
paul was a rejected stalker, rash, impulsive, angry.
and I'm agreeing with you.
patrol's got a lead on Paul Watson.
a car with missing plates, same make and model as his was found near an airport motel where a man matching his description checked in, paying cash.
get us two backup. Don't let the location out.
I don't want a bunch of angry cops showing up before I do.
Hey! Stop!
stop!
look. I didn't do it.
why are you running?
let's stop with the running, huh?
Paul's ready.
is his lawyer here?
he says he doesn't need one.
thanks for coming.
let's do this.
Paul, this is deputy D. A. Amanda Taylor.
before you say anything, I need you to acknowledge in her presence that you waive your right to an...
Yeah, fine.
I don't need a lawyer because I didn't shoot Cara.
you are aware that everything you're saying here is on record and can and will be used against you?
Yes, I get it.
I'd like to acknowledge that Paul Watson understands his Miranda rights by law.
he's all yours. - Thank you.
so you never went to her wedding?
no.
we have a witness putting you at the hotel this morning, Paul.
I'm sorry. Yes. I was at the hotel, but it was hours before the wedding.
giving you time to set up your little sniper's nest on the roof across the street.
no.
so why did you run from us?
when I heard that Cara had been shot,
I knew that her father and every cop in L. A. would come after me.
Jimmy's a hard ass.
why didn't you come to me?
would you believe me?
do you believe me now?
we found a rifle in your motel room.
Yeah. To protect myself.
test it.
I didn't shoot Cara.
there was no gun shot residue found on Paul's hands or clothing, and his rifle wasn't fired recently.
or he wore gloves and dumped the actual rifle he used.
we have no recent evidence of Paul harassing Cara.
what were you doing at the hotel this morning?
I just wanted to apologize to her for being an ass.
you ever hear of a text, tweet, or an e-mail?
you violated your restraining order.
you and Ben told me to get some therapy.
I did. It helped.
that whole thing with Cara, it was the first time in my entire life where I couldn't get my way.
I was a spoiled jerk, and, yeah, I did mess with her, but I get that now.
so you show up at her wedding?
look. I just wanted one minute, one minute with her before her wedding so I could wish her well, and maybe I didn't think it through.
after everything that went down between us,
I -- I thought it would matter to her.
seems like he's actively trying to get over Cara.
that's not typical of a revengeful stalker.
yeah? Or he's just lying.
OK. What happened?
I never even saw her because her lunatic dad chased me away.
I didn't shoot Cara.
we can't let the guy walk.
well, we don't have enough to hold him.
I can build a circumstantial case with what we have.
a disgruntled stalker with motive and opportunity.
that's not enough for trial.
put enough pressure on him, he'll plead to it.
for the last 9 years, I worked homicide in New York city.
I'm telling you, this guy's not a liar. - Why is it that New Yorkers remind us where they're from?
now call me unpopular, but I don't think Paul did it.
are you serious?
Yep.
I'm with Jack.
Paul's an emotional hothead, but we're looking for the complete opposite of Paul.
and who would that be?
male, ex-military, 30s, precision sharpshooter, maybe green beret or some specialty team, analytical, stoic, outwardly not emotional, but internally, he's eaten alive by his feelings, consumed by them.
the man's obsession controls him, fuels him, keeping him focused and precise.
he's obsessed, and my gut says he's not done.
the stick's not working. Well, we have to do it manually.
get the crane in.
we did it. Now all we have to do is gas up and go.
Hey. You didn't finish your dinner.
are you hungry?
no.
we did it! Yes!
are you sure?
Yes.
OK.
honey, you didn't clean your room.
what did I say, huh?
mom, can you come help me?
all right, honey.
I'm coming.
so how'd you get the spot?
excuse me?
tau is a specialized unit.
elite.
was that insult accidental or intentional?
no. Seriously.
there were 300 applicants for your spot.
Beth chose you.
that's a good question.
I'll have to ask her sometime.
unless you were a favor, somebody owes somebody something,
you're the IOU.
why don't you ask Beth yourself?
I will.
Beth, ballistics came back on the slug from the rooftop.
it's not a match with Paul's rifle.
well, that's not a surprise.
right, but this is.
our bullet matches as lug taken out of a gang member who was shot and killed in south central.
when was he shot?
early this morning before Cara.
doesn't make any sense.
I know.
work up a profile on the new victim. Maybe it will give us something.
on it. His girlfriend is in house for questioning. I'll talk to her.
get back to me.
OK, honey. It's time for bed.
OK.
let's put everything away, please.
thank you.
daddy will be home any minute, ok?
OK.
coffee? - No. I've been here all day.
I'm going home.
I know this is a tough time and answering all these questions is a hassle, but if you know who shot Jesse, you can help me out.
I told every cop here
I straight up don't know.
tiny, you know what I really enjoy after a hard day at work?
do I look like I care?
there's this little bar in Silver Lake that makes the best Moscow Mule.
I'm meeting my friend there tonight.
I think you know her -- Cleo Tate?
who?
you probation officer.
I didn't do anything.
those track marks on your arm say otherwise.
you're a bitch.
I prefer assertive.
sit down.
I still don't know who shot Jesse.
anything out of the ordinary happen lately?
did Jesse ever talk about being followed or watched?
Yeah.
he said he thought there was someone in the apartment one day.
a couple of weeks ago, I saw him looking over his shoulder, so I asked him about it.
he said it was nothing he thought he was being paranoid.
what did you think?
he either was or wasn't.
he was in a gang, so he's been followed, marked, had his ass whupped more times...
nearly done.
do you know this man -- Paul Watson?
no.
this woman was shot today with the same gun used to kill Jesse.
what's her name?
Cara Lambert. Do you know her?
no, but I think Jesse said there's a cop with the same last name.
Yeah. Jimmy Lambert.
Jimmy Lambert arrested the dead banger Jesse Hightower a few years ago when he was still in the street.
used him as a C. I. instead of putting him away, but here's the weird thing.
they became friends.
friends?
that's what the girlfriend said.
when Jimmy was a kid, he was on a bad track.
a cop turned things around for him.
Jimmy was trying to pay it forward.
he tried to get Jesse out of the life, encouraged him and his girlfriend to get their GEDs.
Jimmy would come by, check in on him like he really cared.
he was a work in progress, but they had this odd father-son relationship.
Jesse Hightower is dead?
we know you were looking out for him.
that kid had a lot of potential.
he was killed with the same gun that was used on Cara.
well, that doesn't make sense.
my daughter didn't even know him.
why would Paul shoot Jesse?
well, that's it. He wouldn't.
are you saying that I'm the common denominator here?
Yes. Does anyone have a grievance against you?
more importantly, who else could be in danger?
we need a list of your family members.
who's closest to you?
uh, my sister and her family are in town for the wedding.
we're securing everyone on the guest list.
who else? - My brother in Chicago.
OK. But there has to be more family and friends.
maybe your old partner can help put together a list for us.
Jimmy, where's Frank?
we were told he'd be with you.
he just left.
how close are you guys?
he's my closest friend.
get him on the phone.
it's going straight to voicemail. - What's his address?
uh, 1949 Sterling Drive, Studio City.
I'll get uniforms en route.
how's jimmy?
he's a wreck. Still at the hospital.
and Cara?
there's no word yet.
I tried calling you, but you weren't picking up your phone.
Yeah. They made me turn my phone off at ICU.
must have forgotten to turn it back on.
I'll make you something to eat.
why don't you go shower?
perfect.
thank you, baby.
Hey, dad.
what are you doing up?
I wanted to see you.
you want a ride?
sure.
come on.
can I help you?
I'm lieutenant Beth Davis.
who's at home with you, Mrs. Santos?
my husband and son.
all right. Will you step outside, please?
please.
he's here.
he's running!
move! He's running!
you're bleeding.
I'm fine.
I didn't see his face.
he was built, under 6 feet, wiry, strong.
guy was fast. He knew what he was doing.
he sat in Frank's closet for hours?
he sat on a rooftop unseen for longer.
he's special ops. Has to be.
could be someone you arrested or convicted.
he's angry, thinks you wronged him.
or he believes you hurt someone he cares about.
Beth Davis.
think ex-military, proficient with guns and knives.
all right. Got it.
two guys you asked us to check out, they both have alibis.
I keep a list of all the people that have made credible threats against me in my office.
I think there are a few more that fit that profile.
those are from last year. This is this year.
who's that in the photo with you, Jimmy?
that's me and Jesse at the midtown youth center.
and Cara and Frank.
Yeah.
today's victims. What are you thinking, Jack?
Jimmy at his desk.
look where I'm sitting.
who sits here?
my officers, men under my command.
not perps?
never.
are we looking for a cop?
one of my men?
someone who sat right here staring at your loved ones while you reprimanded him, made him feel small.
this is where it began.
this where he started plotting against you.
anyone work for you who's ex-military?
most of my men are ex-military.
someone who sat right here, Jimmy.
and he's someone with a grievance against you.
I fired him two years ago.
former special forces, sharpshooter in Afghanistan.
get me a last known on Silas Martin, former LAPD, Metro Division.
send patrol to his house. He's armed and dangerous.
all right, Jimmy. What do we need to know?
he killed a teenager in a high-school parking lot, said the kid pulled a gun, but no weapon was recovered at the scene.
his military records were clean, but when I did some digging, I found that he was treated for anxiety as a kid.
and I think there were even more issues.
the man was unstable. I had to let him go.
his appeal dragged on and on, but his termination was finalized 6 months ago.
did he ever threaten you?
no. He barely said anything at his hearing.
I knew he was upset, but I would have never expected this.
the dismissal was just a trigger.
the way he's responding is tied to an underlying psychosis.
that son of a bitch.
we got an address. Van Nuys.
judging by the mail piled up by the door,
he hasn't been here for a couple days.
found anxiety medicine in the bathroom.
doesn't look like he's been taking them.
he needs them. He saw serious combat in Afghanistan, based on his records.
you're gonna like his taste in wallpaper.
it's all the legal filings from his hearings and appeals.
diagrams of the shooting that cost him his job.
Where's the gun?
he was trying to prove his innocence.
no local family, no real friends, no girlfriend.
LAPD was all he had.
so when his appeal was rejected 6 months ago, he really did lose everything.
stopped taking his meds, his rational thinking was thrown off.
Jimmy became the target of his anger and frustration.
he wants revenge.
not revenge. Revenge is about damaging the enemy.
this is resentful stalking.
he needs retribution against Jimmy for firing him, but he also needs to prove his righteousness.
but resentful stalkers rarely turn to violence.
listen to new guy. He read the manual.
Yeah, but this guy's a soldier.
violence is in his nature.
after his appeals were rejected, he probably thought, you know, he needed to escalate to regain some power or control in his life.
guys, you need to see this.
S.I.D. just unlocked these.
Silas was getting ready for war.
but why target Jimmy's loved ones?
Jimmy took away the thing that Silas valued most, his job, his identity, so he's taking from Jimmy what he values most...
Cara, Jesse, and Frank,
the photos he saw every time he went into Jimmy's office.
he must have thought about it, over and over and over a thousand times, fantasized until it wasn't enough.
he had to make it real.
he planned and stalked meticulously over these last 6 months.
and decided to turn Cara's wedding into Jimmy's day of reckoning.
guys, check this out.
I'm U. S. Special Forces, Silas Martin.
I was a proud officer of the LAPD.
I want to state officially and for the record that you, Lieutenant James Lambert, dirtied my name and my reputation.
it's his manifesto.
I showed up at every hearing where I sat through lie after lie.
I trusted that the system would vindicate me, but you, James Lambert, betrayed my faith.
my name and my badge, they were everything to me.
you stole them from me.
I was--heh--I was, what, the innocent lamb in your evil lion's den?
you drove me to what I've become.
this guy's lost it.
I may not survive, but I find solace
I knowing that in my final act,
I will reveal you for the liar that you are, and then you and your lies will be forever distinguished on this planet.
I will have my justice, and the truth will prevail.
this is his end game.
he made Jimmy suffer, and now he wants to confront him.
he wants Jimmy to admit he lied to declare his innocence.
Where's Jimmy now?
with Cara at the hospital.
I'll get back to you with those stats.
OK. - Thanks.
Hey. I'm still in here.
come on. Not funny, guys.
would you like a coffee?
no. I'm good.
I know I'm not what you want for your daughter
not now, Terry, please.
I'm sorry about everything.
don't worry about it.
you're off the hook.
it's all my fault.
I'm sorry.
no worries.
any sign of Silas?
we have men all over this place.
Where's Jimmy Lambert?
I saw him around 20 minutes ago.
he went down that hallway.
I thought he had gone to grab something to eat.
and that's the last time you saw him?
Yeah.
keep Miss Holt safe.
you two, with me.
come on. Wake up. No sleeping.
we need to talk, Jimmy.
I think you have something you want to tell me.
why are you doing this?
you know why.
your lies have come home to roost.
huh? How's it feel?
got no fight in you now, do you, huh?
are you ready to tell me the truth?
because I really -- oh, god, Jimmy! I need to hear the truth.
I know that that kid had a gun.
wake up!
wake up, Jimmy! Hmm?
come on, Jimmy? What'd you do with the gun, huh?
who moved the gun? Tell me!
I know that that kid -- that kid had a gun, Jimmy.
there was no gun. We looked.
you're lying, Jimmy.
why do you keep lying?
I saw a gun in his hand.
he was gonna shoot me.
did my daughter have a gun, too?
that's your fault.
that was your fault, Jimmy.
that is your fault.
you made me do that.
there's a gun aimed at your back.
turn around, put your hands up.
I said put your hands up.
I'm in O.R.6. I got Silas and Jimmy.
get some help in here.
how's she doing?
the doctors induced a coma while they wait for the swelling in her brain to go down, but they're hopeful.
you okey, Jimmy? Doctors check you out?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I just can't help thinking that...
there is nothing more you could have done.
all that matters now is that Cara makes it.
well, she has to, and when she wakes up, we're gonna have a wedding, right, Terry?
nice job, new guy.
you think?
I do. Have a good night.
Hey, Ben. Your assessment on Paul was right on, man.
I know. Good night.
you got a second?
no. There's nothing more to talk about.
you shouldn't have followed me here.
this isn't just about you and me. This is about our son.
how is Ethan?
you're about 7 years too late to play that card.
I gave you two weeks, Jack. Time's ticking.
leave L. A. or I'm gonna force your hand.
is there something I need to know about you and Amanda?
no.
so if I clocked some serious tension between the two of you, I'd be totally wrong?
you know how I always make a bad first impression.
right. Whatever it is, fix it.
I don't want it poisoning my unit.
you know, I'm getting hungry.
you want to grab a bite to eat?
no, thanks.
you sure?
Yes, and you don't need to ask me again.
what if I want to ask?
the answer will always be no.
got it.
I know why you hate me.
yeah? Why's that?
I was a favor. My captain pushed my transfer on your captain, and you had to take me.
I know I wasn't your first choice.
shocker.
or even your second choice.
I know you had 300 other applicants.
372. You were not even in the top 20.
I'll try harder.
good thing you don't suck.
wait. You think I'm doing a good job?
good night, Jack.
good night.
what's wrong?
I saw someone outside.
hang on.
well, I don't see anyone, honey.
the Soho house? No, I can't.
I have an early call time tomorrow night, and I've got a ton of a dialogue to learn.
why don't we do Giorgio's this weekend?
OK. All right. Talk to you later. Bye.
Paul, you can't do this.
you can't show up here and profess your love and expect me to forget everything you've ever done.
OK. "Paul begs." Blah, blah, blah.
I'll never trust you, Paul, and once the trust is gone, love is lost.
tears flow.
you still here?
I thought you were taking the night off, babe.
yummy.
No!
so how goes it with the child?
must you torture me?
did I say, "child"?
I meant very young man.
of legal age, I might add.
what's his name again?
when do I get to meet the young but legal Brody?
uh, I'm seeing him later today.
you, however, shall see him when hell freezes over
you know I am thrilled.
seriously, how's it going?
it's hot, no-strings fun like you said.
I follow directions.
good girl.
and Brody? What's his deal?
is he fine with it being light and fun?
he's fine. Please. He's a child.
he's not a child. He's just a...
very, very young legal man.
go. Get now. I'm done with you.
Bye.
morning, Belle.
good morning. Jack is looking for you.
your mail.
Thanks.
Hollywood station called in a home invasion on an active case.
which one?
actress. Nina Preston. News already broke.
reporters and paparazzi are all over her house.
Janice and Ben are already on the scene.
you OK? Bad news?
what?
Oh. I'm not being nosy.
it's big letters. I can read it from here.
Hey. Let's step back.
never seen her show. What's it called... "Savage Shore"?
I haven't seen it either, but it's a big hit.
it's made her the target of several stalkers.
she has a huge fan base.
I mean, look at the paparazzi.
what do you think you're doing?
just going for a better shot. You can't see anything from here.
check this. I'll be outside, OK?
Nina's out back, and she's pretty shaken.
she's with her sister.
are we looking for Heather Miller?
we're locating her now. Apparently, she was released from the hospital a month ago, downgraded to outpatient.
all right. Well, keep me in the loop. I'm gonna go talk to Nina.
who's Heather Miller?
an obsessed fan of Nina's.
booked on two counts of trespassing last year and was diverted to a court-mandated psychiatric ward.
delusional, dissociative disorder.
violent? - Potentially.
did Nina get a look at the attacker?
neither did the security cameras.
she has a full-on panic room.
Nina's had some bad luck when it comes to fans.
the attacker's wearing a burn victim mask.
what's that about?
it's because Paul burned his face.
in "Savage Shore." Paul ran into a burning building because he thought Lily was inside, and that's when he got horribly disfigured, but turns out, Lily was never inside the building.
it was all a ploy by Bruce to kill Paul.
only it backfired because Lily ended up falling in love with Paul.
interesting how you can work side by side with someone and you don't really know them at all.
let me guess. You watch "The Good Wife"?
where were you last night, Emily?
I was here till around 6: 00, and then I had to go run some errands. I'm also Nina's assistant.
sister and assistant? How does that work?
I offered to help her after that girl started stalking her.
Nina didn't feel comfortable with strangers in the house.
any other employees?
Nina's attacker knew personal things about her.
lasagna was her favorite food, and roses were her favorite flower.
can you think of anyone who knows Nina like that?
Yep. Anyone on the Internet.
Nina has a lot of fans.
some of them go a little crazy-town.
has she thought about hiring private security.
when did you put in the panic room?
after that horrible situation with Sandra Bullock.
you stated that your attacker was a man.
could it have been a woman?
I guess. Um, I didn't really get a good look because of the mask.
the body was covered, the hands had gloves, a big coat.
you don't think it was that nutty girl you guys put away, do you?
I got a notification that she'd been released.
we're looking into it.
has she had any contact with you lately?
where would I see her?
I don't really go out that much.
this is my fourth stalker in 3 years, Lieutenant.
I don't go anywhere to see anyone.
listen. I get it. You know, I wanted this.
I came to L. A. to be an actress, to be famous.
I'm not crying a river here, but...
I should be safe in my own home.
celebrity stalkers write to their targets before approaching.
her publicist gave us access to her e-mail, but there are thousands of messages.
it will take us a while to slog through them all.
I scoured the Internet.
there's hundreds of forums and chat rooms about Nina and the show.
she has 3 million Twitter followers and even more on Instagram.
so her life is out there.
her stalker has too much access to her.
complete access. The paparazzi chronicle every aspect of her life.
sometimes, it can get out of control.
I'm running background checks on several paps with arrest records.
what's the show about?
it's your typical teen Gothic romance.
very addictive. Her TV character is in love with a disfigured man.
it's very "Beauty and the Beast" thematically.
the stalker may see himself as Nina's savior and she his.
dinner, candles, bottle of wine.
I mean, this is like bad textbook romance.
what are you thinking?
this kind of display screams incompetent suitor, someone single and lonely, never been in a real relationship, possibly a virgin, but he's not after sex.
he's looking for a love connection.
he spends every waking minute thinking about Nina and their future together.
like her previous stalker... Heather Miller.
where is she?
they're bringing her in now.
does he have access to send me mail?
that's all I'm asking.
no. There's no return address, but it's postmarked Seattle, so he sent it.
somebody sent it.
will you please check again and call me back on this number?
if I don't pick up, leave a message.
thank you.
Heather Miller is here.
is Nina OK?
someone hurt her?
someone's stalking her?
you were stalking her.
I'm not a stalker.
I'm an obsessed and enthusiastic fan, but I pose no danger to Nina or anyone else.
you climbed her wall carrying an 8-inch hunting knife.
she's crazy.
it was a great episode.
they found this one doctor who agreed to reconstruct Paul's face, but it was extremely dangerous because of all the nerve damage, and Paul almost died.
the best cliffhanger ever.
you're crazy.
and you've had no contact with Nina since you were discharged from the hospital?
no. I was told I couldn't contact her.
something changed?
you're still very active on the fan boards and chat rooms.
Yeah. I was never told I couldn't be a fan of the show.
where were you last night?
are you gonna tell Nina that you talked to me?
because I really miss her. I'd appreciate if you told her that, or I could write it on a sticky.
she's crazy, but I don't think she did it.
I'm with Jack. She has issues, but she doesn't fit the profile.
I agree. I don't think what Heather's looking for is a love relationship.
I think what she wants is a friend.
Ben, have you found any arrest records concerning Nina Preston?
there's several, but there's one pap, total sleaze.
he's been arrested a bunch of times for trying to take pics of Nina.
that's the guy I pulled off the wall at Nina's house this morning.
I want to talk to him.
Nina as Lily: Bruce, what's wrong?
what are you doing?
man as Bruce: I'm tired, Lily.
I've done everything I know to make you love me.
I can't compete with a phantom, and if can't have you, well, he's not gonna have you either.
ha ha ha!
Yeah. I should have known you'd show up.
you're a dead man. Make that a dead freak.
Paul, careful!
Paul! Paul! Be careful!
Paul, Paul! OK.
stop it, stop!
stop it, both of you!
be careful! Aah!
I'm not the guy you're looking for.
Oh, really? Most paparazzi jump from celebrity to celebrity, but you stick with Nina day and night.
what can I say? I've always had a unique talent for focusing all my energy on one task.
Yeah. Some would call that an obsession.
your wife divorced you last month right after you started focusing on Nina.
what does that have to do with anything?
it's classic transference.
you get your heart broken, then you turn your attention to someone new.
you spend all your time following Nina.
it's understandable you start to feel like you know her.
it's my job to follow Nina.
well, maybe it started as a job and turned into a fixation.
next thing you know, you're breaking into her house just to get close to her.
look. That wasn't me, OK?
I stick with Nina because my ex-wife left me knee-deep in debt, and Nina's my cash cow.
a shot of her in short shorts at Runyon gets me 500 bucks.
a bad hair day brings in a thou.
Nina's what they call in my world a sure thing.
why is that you get all the best shots before anyone else?
I got a source, OK?
someone tells me where Nina's gonna be.
what's his name?
Heh. It's the wild west out there, man.
TMZ's got eye's everywhere.
I need every advantage I can get.
you saying you'd rather go down for something you didn't do?
no. I'm saying I want a lawyer.
you know, you come in and out of my life.
I feel like a booty call.
Really? Oh. That's funny because I feel exactly the same way.
you did call me.
OK. Guilty.
I just wanted to see you.
it's like you're my own private little toy.
hmm. I don't have a problem with that.
you know, I really like you.
just as long as you don't take it too seriously.
this is supposed to be light and fun.
light and fun.
light and fun it is.
because I have issues.
you don't want to get too close.
is this... is this too close?
no.
is this? - No.
it's perfect.
we all have issues.
I have to go to work.
I'm gonna have a shower.
care to join me?
actually, I, uh, I should run, too.
there's a midnight showing of "Chinatown" tomorrow night at the Vista if you're interested.
Yeah. Sounds great.
we close at 11: 00. I'll meet you there.
I subpoenaed Eddie Gaines' bank records.
he's been wiring 10% of every photo fee to an external account.
so he was telling the truth about his source.
Jack: Still don't like him.
guy's a parasite, a legal stalker.
Janice, can you track this external account?
give me a minute.
whoever the source is, he knew about the home invasion at Nina's before anyone else did. Could be our stalker.
why would Nina's stalker tip off the paparazzi?
same reason why Nina would...
attention, notoriety.
money. Most celebrity stalkers have a hard time holding on to a steady job.
well, I'll be damned.
you won't believe who it is.
you're our leak, Emily.
well, if I hadn't helped him, he would have gotten the photo some other way.
this way, Nina gets the publicity, and I get the cash.
it's win-win.
you put your sister in danger.
guys like Eddie Gaines will do whatever it takes to get paid.
that's exactly why I chose him.
you resent her, don't you?
you don't know anything about our relationship.
no, but I do know what it's like when sister's don't protect each other.
well, Nina was always the gifted one.
she was destined for greatness.
that must have been hard to compete with.
everything comes easy for Nina.
look. I get it. You do the job of 6 people.
Nina has no idea what you do for her.
I took the job because she needed my help.
I had a life back in Ohio, and I left it all behind for her.
why not just leave?
easier said than done.
I can't afford to.
so you make a deal with Eddie Gaines.
I just want my life back.
that money is the only way it's ever gonna happen.
Nina: You put my life in danger for a little bit of extra cash?
what kind of sister does that?
I gave up everything to help you.
I had a good job in Ohio,
I had a good life.
you wanted Hollywood, not me.
you need to leave. I can't look at you.
that's great because you know what?
it's all about you... all the time.
selfish bitch.
I can't stand her.
no, no, no, no!
need some help?
no. I'm just gonna call AAA.
it will take them over an hour to get here, and I've got a jack.
Really? Thank you.
thank you again so much.
right.
were you just coming from Nina Preston's house?
no. I don't think so.
Heh. I get it.
you wouldn't say for privacy reasons, right?
do you live around here?
I don't think I've seen you before.
I'm just visiting someone.
I wouldn't do that, Emily.
what do you want?
I want you to be nicer to Nina.
you've hurt her. I know what you did.
I can't let you get away with that.
No!
No! No!
No! No!
help! Somebody! - Are you OK?
he said I'd hurt Nina.
that's when I knew he'd been watching us.
have you ever seen this guy before?
never.
can you describe him?
late 20s, early 30s, brown hair, average-looking.
a sketch artist is gonna come in and talk to you.
try to remember as much detail as possible.
I deserve this after what I did to Nina.
nobody deserves this.
reed is arranging 24-hour protection.
so you really think this guy could be my stalker?
we're not sure yet.
Emily and I had a really bad fight.
I said some things.
we never used to be this way.
we used to be best friends, you know?
why does your sister work for you?
I needed her. I moved to L. A. I was all alone.
having her here was nice, you know?
she's my family. I trusted her.
Yeah, but family can be tough, especially sisters.
people can disappoint you, Nina, but they can also surprise you.
I know she loves you.
the sketch artist sent over the drawing of Emily's attacker.
so this is our guy.
I compared it against all the paparazzi mug shots we have on file.
nothing close.
get this to Nina's people. Tell them to be on the lookout.
I think I found something.
the attack the house, where the stalker made dinner for Nina, was right out of an episode of Savage Shore.
what is this?
an apology.
you shouldn't be here, Paul.
see, I thought it was a coincidence, but then when Emily was attacked, I knew.
make that a dead freak.
Bruce! Paul, careful.
Janice: Our stalker used a tire iron. See?
he's reenacting scenes from the show.
from the point of view of the guy with the burned face.
Paul. His name's Paul.
our stalker identifies with Paul because he's different, an outsider?
is that right? Probably like our guy.
exactly.
Nina's character... - Lily.
Lily is in love with Paul in spite of his deformity?
Yes.
our stalker is fixated on Nina because he feels she's the only one who sees past his imperfections.
I made your favorite, breakfast sandwich on wheat toast.
you forgot to cut the crusts off.
now I don't like you working the late shift.
I hardly ever get to see you.
well, I'm not sure about that outfit.
it's not appropriate business attire.
I wear an apron. It's fine.
Oh, stay off the 405. There's construction, and call me when you get there.
I will!
don't take that tone with me, young man.
I'm sorry, mom.
you forgot your pills.
I love you, dear.
I love you, too.
I've been a fan of your show for a long time.
paul and I could be the same person.
are you my Lily? I think we're meant to be.
destiny will draw us together.
is this the only e-mail that fits the search parameters?
there was a guy in Hong Kong and another one in Florida, but this is the only one within a hundred-mile radius of L. A.
Janice: It sounds like to could be our guy.
and he just sent the one e-mail?
it's the only one I found.
seems weird he would only write to Nina once.
Jack: He's impatient.
when he didn't hear back from her immediately, he decided to show up at her house.
you located the person who sent this yet?
his name is Robert Dalton, 33, lives in El Segundo.
we should check it out.
e-mail us everything you can find on this guy.
I don't believe it.
Robbie is a good boy.
he would never do anything like that.
your son's lying to you, Mrs. Dalton.
we called the store. He was fired over a month ago.
well, that can't be. He told me he was working.
where was he the night before last?
uh, he went to see a movie.
what movie?
he didn't say?
no. He did not say.
look at this.
Robbie's been monitoring Nina's Twitter feed.
beautiful day for a swim,
thank you for all your support.
my sister's doing OK. I hope the police catch this creep before he hurts someone else.
she went wrong with "creep."
impulsive tweeting. Robbie thinks he's helping Nina by attacking Emily.
he could interpret this as rejection.
it could trigger him to go after her.
um, I think I'm gonna go to the cafeteria.
I need some coffee.
press is asking for a statement.
I'd really rather not.
I really need to talk to you, Nina.
I'm sorry about what happened with your sister, but she hurt you, and I was just trying to protect you.
y - you need to back off.
you need to shut up!
just calm down.
shut up!
you shut up!
don't you see?
those people are no good for you.
they don't love you like I do.
I just want to be with you.
I thought that's what you wanted, too.
OK. Please leave.
I'm Paul. You're my Lily.
I love you.
get off me!
help!
I just wanted to talk to her to explain what happened.
you mean about how you tried to kill her sister?
Mmm. No. I didn't want to kill her.
I just... I wanted to hurt her, hurt her enough so that she would leave Nina alone.
you've been watching them.
Emily's so mean to Nina. It's...
obvious she resents her because she's so talented.
Nina doesn't need someone like that in her life.
she needs you?
I can protect her, but when I read that tweet,
I knew she didn't understand.
I had to make her understand.
you were frustrated.
you wrote to her, and she never wrote back.
no. She wrote to me all the time.
we had long talks about everything, about our future, about how we would be together.
so in your opinion you two were close?
as close as two people could be.
I don't understand.
my son has never been violent.
someone must have provoked him.
Mrs. Dalton, I know this is difficult to accept.
Robbie is different.
he's a dreamer.
he gets a little moody if he forgets his medication, but he's never acted out like this.
we found his anti-psychotics hidden in the shed.
we believe he stopped taking them a while ago.
still, that doesn't necessarily...
Robbie was positively I. D.'d by both victims.
your son suffers from delusional disorder.
at some point, he became fixated on Nina Preston, and he created an elaborate fantasy relationship with her.
what's gonna happen to him?
he'll go to the detention center for processing, and then he'll be housed at the psychiatric ward for assessment and treatment.
and then they'll let him go.
once his illness is under control, he will be charged for his crimes.
he's going to prison?
eventually, yes.
I just got off the phone with Nina.
she's relieved that we caught Robbie, and she's decided to hire private security moving forward.
glad to hear it.
guys, Robbie was telling the truth.
I went through his computer, and there's dozens of e-mails between him and Nina Preston.
that's not possible. Nina told me she doesn't respond to fans.
then it's someone posing as Nina.
can you track where they came from?
the IP address leads to public library, but listen to this.
dear Robbie, thank you for your photo.
you're so handsome. Ever thought of becoming a movie star?
sounds like something Robbie would say about himself.
maybe he did. He is delusional.
maybe we're confusing hubris with pride.
you are one of a kind, unique, special.
in my eyes, you are perfect.
no matter what anyone tells you, you deserve all the happiness in the world.
that's something a parent says to a child.
you think his mom wrote e-mails pretending to be Nina?
I met her. She was controlling.
which means Robbie's her world.
maybe she'd do anything to protect him from being hurt, even writing e-mails.
what library did it come from?
el Segundo. It's a mile from Robbie's house.
mom went through his computer, saw the e-mail to Nina, didn't want him to be disappointed, decided to play the part herself.
wouldn't have been hard for her to set up a fake e-mail and pretend to be Nina.
only it backfired.
she fed his delusion.
Nancy Dalton's got a prior arrest for assault with a deadly weapon.
according to the police report, she threatened one of Robbie's schoolmates with a knife.
she pled out and got counseling and probation.
what was the dispute?
she said the kid was bullying and hurting her son, and he needed to be punished.
where is Nina Preston?
she's shooting today.
get a hold of her.
man: OK, folks. That's a wrap.
all right. Good night, everybody.
good night, Nina! - Good night!
Randy, I'll be out in a minute.
very well.
her cell's going to voice-mail.
call studio security, have them alert her private detail.
I'm actually on the phone with them right now.
they're saying Nancy Dalton signed up for studio tour earlier today.
she could still be on the lot.
yeah?
Roger that. I'll keep an eye out.
may I help you?
I'm here for wardrobe.
what happened to Suzie?
Oh, she went home sick after lunch.
I'm Nancy. I'm filling in.
Oh. Well, take whatever you need, Nancy.
all the dresses are hanging in the back.
you're very pretty.
thank you.
not as pretty as on the show but pretty enough.
I get why my boy fell for you.
it's my fault. I never should have written those letters.
um, I'm sorry. What letters?
I didn't know. I didn't know the lengths Robbie would go to to be with you.
what is it that you want?
you hurt my little boy.
he'll be better off with you gone.
Where's Nina's trailer?
last row. You got to go around.
empty. - This way.
he's still alive.
call an ambulance. Stay with him.
come on.
he's... he's my only son. He's special.
I know.
he needs special help.
he'll get it. So will you.
come on.
taking off? - Yeah.
I'll walk out with you.
Hey. Uh, listen. You've worked with Beth for a long time.
what do you know about her?
you're not gonna get her in bed, if that's what you're wondering.
no. I didn't mean that.
what's her backstory?
honestly, I don't know.
you don't know?
I Googled her when I got this job.
you Googled her?
I Googled you.
but when I did a search on Beth Davis, there was nothing outside the LAPD.
like what? She doesn't exist?
she's a private woman, secretive, doesn't use social media.
you're a good detective.
think about it.
something bad happened to her.
she's a walking textbook for someone who's lived through a major trauma.
do you really need to know the specifics?
guess not.
OK. You're certain he didn't send it?
OK. Thank you for checking.
you think Ray sent it?
it's exactly the kind of thing he would do.
but the hospital said it wasn't him.
what if he found me?
what if...
do you remember what you told me when you put Bob away?
you said he can't hurt me again unless I let him.
I know.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
this case I was on got me thinking about my sister and how I haven't thought about her or what happened in a really long time...
and I liked that I hadn't thought about it.
it was a relief somehow. Does that make me a terrible person?
it makes you human.
Oh. Sorry.
we can finish this another time.
stay. I'll reschedule. Brody will understand.
Hello?
Hey. What are you wearing?
picturing something black and sexy.
tell me you haven't left yet.
I just walked out the door.
you're not coming.
it's a friend thing. I... Beth needs me tonight.
Yeah. Totally get it. Is she OK?
Yeah. Yeah. I'll explain it later.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
I'll hold you do that.
okay, Sam. - Good luck.
you look like shit.
you look worse.
Yeah.
so I kind of missed you.
I missed you, too.
did that just get weird?
Yes. Maybe a little.
here, can I take your bags?
I can handle it.
you remember this.
Oh, my favorite car.
so, this is me.
you're kidding.
Hey, this couch folds out.
or you could sleep in the window seat.
this is the worst apartment I've ever seen.
Hey! It's not much, but it's mine.
there's cable TV, everything.
this is for me?
no, it's for my other friend who just got out of prison.
Yeah.
Oh, the Three Musketeers.
Hey, look at Hirschey.
looks like a baby.
those were the days, my friend.
Yeah.
your place looks, like where I just came from.
except it's worse.
it's not to your liking?
sorry. - "Not to my liking," is the understatement of all time.
there's cable TV.
Yeah, I know. You said that already.
I got Starz and Showtime, and I was in fucking lockdown.
I need to wash up.
can I use the commode for, like, two seconds?
sure. - Thank you.
I hope the commode is to your liking.
Hey, brother.
can we skedaddle out of here, do you think?
is Mama Zeech's still open?
Yeah.
good.
I've been dreaming about her coffee.
Yeah. I could use a cup right now.
we can do whatever you want, Val.
it's your day.
Yeah, let's do it.
Yeah.
you feel like partying?
because I could fucking party right now.
no. I don't feel like partying.
so what, then?
I don't know what to tell you, Val. I do the same thing.
every day, I paint the sunrise, watch the cable TV, try to eat right, relax, go to bed.
nothing earth-shattering.
how's your daughter? How's Jessica?
she doesn't want me to find her.
And?
I did anyway. She's working.
Minneapolis.
yeah? Didn't she have a kid?
your granddaughter.
she did. Does.
what is she up to?
I couldn't find her.
I kept in touch with some people.
what people?
what people do you think?
friends.
high and low places.
friends who would be amenable, to us having our comeback.
I'm retired.
you retired.
I'm serious.
another subject.
I could really fucking party.
you know what I'm saying.
should we go to Miss D's?
miss D's, still exists?
it's Doc. I called.
Yeah. - This is Val.
Yeah, yeah. - Hey.
come in. Come in.
it looks the same.
is Miss DeHaviland around anywhere?
Yeah. I'm Miss DeHaviland.
he's talking about your mother, I think.
Oh, she couldn't take the cold, so she set up shop in Florida.
Boca.
you look like her. - Yeah?
anyway, my friend is looking for a party.
yeah?
what kind of party?
bar Mitzvah. - Oh.
a coming-out party. A going-in party.
Yeah, I got the next best thing.
Oxana!
now, look at this.
I think that's the party I'm talking about. Yeah.
she's from Minsk.
very clean.
Oh, yeah.
clean is good.
happy parole.
follow me.
enjoy.
right.
have a seat. - Thanks.
relax. Relax. - Yeah.
you fixed the place up.
it's the same, but different.
huh.
would you give my regards to your mother, please?
we used to be close.
old friends.
I hope she still remembers me.
so do I.
she's a beauty. - Hello.
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.
nice, too. Sweet girl.
aren't you? She is.
come on. Do you want to have fun?
I'm retired.
we'll have fun.
trust me, case closed. - Come on.
Wendy, I need to use the phone.
is that okay?
Yeah. There's one through there.
thank you.
that was quick.
Yeah. It didn't work.
is something wrong? - That's not good.
no. "Not good"?
it's okay. It's okay. - We'll be back.
what are you smiling at?
do you find it funny? Is this funny? - No!
do you have anything that could help my friend out?
boner pills?
Yeah, we ran out of boner pills.
is this a first for you?
it's okay. - We'll come back.
yeah? - Yeah.
just keep smiling.
we'll be back. I'll settle up with you.
guys, if you get back before 7: 00,
I'll give you the early bird special.
now, I thought you said you retired.
I have.
but some tools, you hate to give up.
Yeah. I could have done that with my dick.
right, that's why we're here.
Oh! That was just plain cruel.
I'm sorry.
do you remember that time you threw that Greek out of the hotel window?
I do.
he fell straight onto a street-meat vendor.
I felt bad about that part.
Oh, this is definitely a violation of my parole.
it's okay. I need to fill my Nexium prescription anyway.
what's Nexium?
it's for my ulcer.
so what are we looking for?
Ah. This.
what is that?
hmm? - Oh.
you're only supposed to take one.
I want to make sure.
so are we done here?
no, I need some perindopril.
what?
and some...
Ooh! Latanoprost.
my co-pay is insane on this one.
and...
Ooh, Aldactone for hypertension.
huh?
how much shit are you on?
a lot.
so how long does this take, to get the pipes working?
I wouldn't know.
what are we going to do while we wait?
three Andrew Jacksons say I run this table.
but you don't have any money.
what does that mean? You spot me.
but that would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.
each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion.
Yeah. Corinthians.
chapter nine, verse seven.
I love Corinthians.
okay. Let's do the five.
Oh, it's all mine...
Oh, wait, let me get out of your way.
you can stay in my way. I don't care.
Oh! - See?
keep it.
thank you. - It's yours.
you gave me a nice thing here.
it's too easy, but I'm going to take it. - Well, it is easy.
Hello! - Oh!
that was not fair.
no, it wasn't.
Uh-oh.
what?
mount Everest just moved into my pants.
so all systems go?
Oh, yeah.
I'm so fucking hard,
I could cut a diamond.
you shouldn't have taken so many.
Oh, fuck that.
my old friend.
are you ready, Val?
Ooh! Wow.
you don't know.
I've never been more ready.
let's go.
Oh, yes.
come on.
the next smile you see will be on Oxana's face.
that's my only son.
Aw. - I'm going to use the phone, okay?
Paul, where's my fucking Kung Pao Chicken?
it's on its way. You got a call.
fuck my ass, and give me the phone.
Claphands here.
it's Doc.
will the package be delivered on time?
I can't do what I said I would do.
well, then if you, can't deliver the package, then you won't be a friend of mine any longer.
do I need to become more explicit here?
no. - No.
I didn't think so.
how long do I have?
what do you mean, how long do you have?
to deliver the package.
how long do I have?
I don't fucking believe this shit.
do I have dementia? Paul, who's the President of the United States?
um... - Shut the fuck up!
you have until morning.
what, like, 10: 00?
or later, like brunch time?
this is like talking to Conchita, my maid.
kill him by 10: 00 in the A. M. or you're dead, too.
the motherfucker shoots my only son!
the only reason I've let you live was for this.
are we clear?
we're clear.
then, good night.
Wendy, Wendy.
doc, is everything all right?
no, but thank you for asking.
I bet you're the type of man who wouldn't let a lady drink by herself. Huh?
of course not.
just a taste.
this is good stuff.
doc, my mother always told me to do the best with what you have, where you are.
your mother was something.
so, did everything work this time, Valentine?
four times. It worked.
I could have gone again, but she's all worn out.
good for you.
come on, let's blow this pop stand.
Wendy, for everything, thank you.
I hope you find peace, Doc.
me, too.
I feel so ready to party!
Bye, Smiley.
those girls look like they want to party.
why embarrass yourself?
embarrass myself?
I'm doing the Battle of the Bulge.
this goes up and down like a fucking yo-yo.
pray for me.
Hey, ladies.
what do you say, what do you know?
it's me, Giacomo.
shouldn't you be in bed?
in bed?
baby, I have got a python in my pants harder than the Rock of Gibraltar.
don't talk to me.
can we go home now? - Oh, no.
definitely not now.
we don't go home.
we're just getting started, buddy.
I need 20 bucks. I'll be right back.
what are you doing, Val?
give it to me. I'm not asking.
Yeah!
Hey, hey, can you help a brother out?
what's happening?
I want you to play something a little different.
you know, like when music was still music, when it had a little soul.
you're talking old school.
old school, yeah.
right, yeah. There's not much call for old school around here.
Yeah, tonight might be different. Okay?
I think it could be.
I can trust you, right? Slow.
you can trust me.
don't let me down.
Hey, I'm back.
first of all, I just want to say, - It was rude, what I did. - Yes.
and I deserve everything you gave me.
I apologize. Do you forgive me?
anyway, do you like to dance?
Mmm-hmm. - Lisa...
listen, Lisa...
I'm Valentine.
my friends call me Val.
now here's the situation.
I've been away for a long time.
I mean, where, I can't say, but I really need you to dance with me.
now, I'm not going to ask you to go home with me.
I'm not going to try to kiss you, or feel your ass, or anything.
I just want to dance.
one song.
that's all I'm proposing.
two people, holding each other, swaying in time.
nothing else.
after that, you'll never see me or hear from me again.
I promise.
how does that sound to you, Lisa?
what do you think?
all right, Val. - Oh, that's good.
thank you. - Thank you.
what can I say?
let me see this.
cataracts.
yeah?
if I blow them, maybe they give me a buzz.
Ah.
Hey, buddy.
Oh, goddamn! What else you got?
I'll try it.
I got some for hypertension.
what are they? They're green.
okay. Here you go.
you never know what can - come out of this shit. - Nice.
Hey, hey, hey! Listen, no drugs at the bar.
if you want to do drugs, have the courtesy to take it to the bathroom.
no, no, no, this is prescription.
I got the hypertension.
you find that funny? I don't.
no. Listen, what else can I get you guys?
Yeah, we want a couple of drinks to go.
to go? - Yes.
that's illegal.
and this isn't?
here, let's make it legal.
you got it.
Ah!
what's this?
Oh, I'm just trying to see what time it is.
do you know what time it is?
do you want to move back a little, sonny boy?
it says so right there.
Yeah. It's getting kind of late, isn't it?
hmm.
come on, let's go.
what was that?
stupid jerk. - Strange.
all our friends, all our business associates, out of sight, out of mind.
you're the only one who kept in touch.
I know, Val.
let me talk for two fucking seconds.
you sent me the care packages.
and those paintings...
I never told you how beautiful they were. - Thank you.
can I talk for two fucking seconds?
I'm serious.
I never told you.
I would stare at those paintings.
I could feel the sun rising.
I could feel it.
thank you, Val.
you're my only friend.
and you are mine.
sit in the car. Come on.
am I?
I'm still hard. Is that a problem?
it is, actually.
I feel kind of light-headed.
that's all right.
just get your leg in there.
Oh, shit.
that's all right.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh," what?
I think I'm going to pass out.
wake up.
I'm up. I'm up, I'm up. - Val, wake up.
you okay?
I don't think so.
am I gonna die?
not tonight.
it's okay, you know? You can tell me.
tell me straight, all right?
not on my watch.
okay. Doc, are you there?
Yeah.
I just want to know if something's gonna happen, that's all.
I just...
I like to know what's gonna happen.
I like information. Okay?
Oh, boy...
Hirsch? What's that?
it's Hirsch's daughter.
you're Hirsch's daughter? Are you kidding me?
you got so big.
I knew you when you were little.
yeah? Time flies, right?
I'm fucking dying.
I'm dying. - What?
I'm fucking dying.
I'm so dizzy. - Rest.
Oh.
take a deep breath.
relax, he's not dying.
the doctor's going to be here in a couple of minutes.
how is your father?
his emphysema's pretty bad.
he's over at The Lighthouse nursing home these days, ever since Mom died.
he's hanging in. - For your 10th birthday, we were there.
I threw you up in the air.
that was you?
I threw you up in the air, and I caught you.
do you remember that?
I felt like I was flying.
I remember you catching me.
you remember that?
Oh! Oh, oh, have mercy.
you were in jail, right?
Yeah. So what?
what did you do?
I'm supposed to answer that? Fuck.
I got, like, no blood in my brain anymore.
he had some bad luck is all.
Oh. Yeah, well, I know all about that.
excuse me.
Yeah.
I'll take a quick look.
Mmm-hmm.
how many pills did he take?
a fistful.
I see. - Are you a real doctor?
are you a real patient? Is that a real penis?
Mr. Valentine, you have what is called vein-induced priapism.
now, I can give you some blood thinners to open things up a bit, but the old blood's got to be removed in order for fresh blood to flow in.
removed? In what way, removed?
what's he talking about?
Oh!
Oh! Fuck me.
okay, let's relax.
what is this? Where are you going, Doc?
where you going? - I'm out of here.
Oh, no, what are you doing?
I'll be... I'll be in the waiting room.
look at me. Breathe.
maybe I partied a little too hard.
maybe a little.
I don't have, uh, health insurance.
I paid the bill.
okay.
so who's going to do it?
do what?
you know what.
I don't.
let's just drop the welcome-home thing, okay?
I know.
Hey, there, Doc.
Hey, Alex.
who's your friend?
this is my best friend.
Valentine, Alex.
he just got back from a long trip.
well, how was your trip, Valentine? - Oh, it was...
I'm just glad I'm back.
and I don't answer to the name Valentine.
my friends call me Val.
okay, well, then I'll call you Val, Val.
well, then we're friends.
Yeah, you can never have enough.
Yeah, you're right there.
doc and I, we've been friends for a while now. Haven't we?
we have.
I remember the very first time he walked in here.
you remember that?
sure, I do.
I hate to break up this remembering of more wistful times, - but I'm a little on the peckish side. - Sure.
what will it be tonight, fellows?
uh, tea and lemon, please.
okay.
I'll have the surf and turf, and a root beer float.
all right, how do you like your steak done, Val?
bloody.
coming right up.
how are you doing, Tony?
can I have a little more?
is she always so sweet?
every day I walk out of here, I'm always better.
Yeah.
so who's gonna do it?
I don't know.
it's you, isn't it?
I don't know.
it's you. Come on, just say it.
it's you.
what do you think this is here?
I'm not gonna blame you for anything. A job is a job.
if the roles were reversed, I'd do it in a heartbeat.
come on, man. Say it's you!
it's me.
Claphands.
he's got a mean streak in him. No?
a bit of an understatement.
Yeah.
the meanest, most vindictive motherfucker outside the devil himself.
the first couple of years I was inside,
I had my head on a swivel, you know?
I was lookin' here, lookin' there.
what the fuck is gonna happen and when is it gonna happen?
is it gonna happen in the laundry room?
on the yard? Am I gonna get it in the fuckin' cafeteria?
that's all I thought about.
and then I understood something.
he's gonna make me serve every single day of my sentence so it would end up just like this.
so how are you gonna do it?
in my apartment, while you're asleep.
you see, that's got no flavor.
that's got no style.
come on, what is that?
while I'm asleep.
how do you think I should do it?
I don't.
there's the rub.
he put his son on the job.
this was a bad idea.
okay, fine. I'm not gonna ask questions.
the first sign of trouble, the kid panics, starts shooting everywhere.
he catches my bullet in the crossfire.
it could have been anybody's.
I was there. I know.
this was an accident.
how is it my fault?
I'm a fucking stand-up guy.
I took the fall for everyone.
you did. I know that.
and they pressed me.
I didn't say a word.
not a fuckin' word.
and this is what it comes to.
when did Claphands give you this job?
the day you went in.
for 28 years, he was sitting on you?
Yes.
now that is fucked.
here's your tea, Doc.
root beer float for you.
and surf and turf.
Alex. Can I say that this is the best surf and turf
I've seen in all my travels.
yeah?
can I say that?
that's very kind of you to say, Val.
are you okay, Doc? - Yeah.
so when are you gonna do it?
by 10: 00 this morning, it has to be done.
okay.
this doesn't work. What time is it now?
1: 17 in the a. m.
that's about nine hours.
Yeah.
let's get in the car. - Hey, man, let's...
why don't we skedaddle down the road a bit?
I want to walk off this, uh, surf and turf and a root beer float. You know?
my digestion.
sure.
so what are my options now?
you could run.
they'd find me.
you might buy some time.
but if I run...
what?
you're not gonna have any friends anymore.
true, but you'd have a head start at least.
it's better this way.
how is it better?
it's better because then I can say goodbye.
I don't want you to say goodbye.
well, what do you want me to say, then?
I have to say goodbye.
there's nothing left for me to say.
hold up.
something has presented itself.
what?
what?
what kind of a big, beautiful beast of a car is this?
Val, no.
I think she's lonely.
I think she wants us to take her out on a date.
this car belongs to the Jargoniew brothers.
I happen to know that.
and that's supposed to mean something to me?
nobody messes with these guys.
these are the type of guys that take your kidneys out and not even sell them.
if we only had a coat hanger, right?
you can't open a car with a coat hanger anymore, Val.
says who?
says the people who make cars.
what kind of asshole keeps a car like this open?
these guys don't worry about somebody stealing their car, Val.
they better start.
come on.
these guys, I'm telling you...
these morons even left the key.
where does this fuckin' key go?
this is not a good idea, Val.
Yeah, well, my life is full of not-good ideas.
how do you start it? You know how?
they make cars differently these days.
Yeah.
so do you know how to do it?
put your foot on the brake. Press that button.
this button?
see? - Holy shit.
fuck. - Whoa!
where to?
where do you think?
our friend needs rescuing. - Yes.
Oh, I don't ever want to end up in one of these places.
me, too.
Hey, excuse me.
yeah?
would you happen to know where Richard Hirsch's room is?
I like Hirsch. Are you his friends?
Yeah, the best.
his room is down at the end of the hall, and to your left.
thanks a bunch.
Hey, are you here to rescue him?
how did you know?
I wish somebody would come and rescue me.
we all do, honey.
Oh, my God!
I feel like I'm dreamin'.
Hirsch. - You're still here.
we're all still here.
you fuckin' guys, just like the old days.
so?
get me the fuck out of here.
get me out of here.
wait a second, let me get a hit.
let's escape.
you want us to bring that?
no, no, let's roll.
you better get dressed.
Hirschey boy.
Oh, man. The sweet taste of freedom.
we got a ride?
this is it.
huh? - Right here.
Oh, man.
you get to drive it.
Oh, ho! - Okay.
there's no legroom here.
Yeah. - It's tight back here.
I just banged my head.
Yeah. To hell with your legroom.
I'm 6'2." Let's go.
Hey. - The situation is not ideal.
you're a master.
Yeah, I was. - You are.
I was. - You don't forget that stuff.
you're a master, Hirsch!
four minutes ago, you were sittin' in a dying house.
now you're sittin' in this beast of a car, you know?
the situation's okay.
all right. Give me the key.
there's no key.
don't fuck around. Give me the key.
it's new. It's a button.
it's automatic. - You push the button. It's computers.
a button? Here? - Yeah.
you put... Put your foot on the brake at the same time.
all right. - Okay?
Yeah. - Can we go now?
well, there's a million dials here. I never saw these before.
man, this is like the future.
Ho-ho!
very nice.
so, Hirsch, what have you been doing since the last time I saw you?
grieving, mostly.
Yeah, me, too.
Yeah, a different kind, I guess.
Hey, I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry about Julie.
well, you know, she was in a lot of pain.
Yeah.
uh, what do you say?
so, how's your health?
well, they took something out of me a couple of months ago.
What'd they take out?
I don't know. I didn't ask. It's none of my business.
but I'm a little more streamlined now, a little more aerodynamic. Which way's the highway?
not the highway, Hirsch.
which way is the highway? I'm not gonna ask again.
go left.
go left, young man. Go left!
Whoa!
so, I got into gardening.
where, in the joint? - Yeah.
Yeah, Julie was into that.
no. Yeah? - Yeah.
I got quite a little green thumb, fellas.
I'm not surprised.
Whoa!
I knew a guy who got out, committed a crime in order to get back in so he could see how his garden was doing.
it sounds like you loved it, too.
loved it? I love it.
I mean, I still do.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh," what?
don't worry. I can lose'em.
I got paroled today, we're driving in a stolen car, and I imagine you're carrying a weapon.
I am.
so? - So...
I'm already fucked five ways to Sunday.
let's rumble!
we got two of them.
I can see. I can see.
hirsch, remember the time in that shit box car with the Chinamen?
Yeah, I do.
I think you should do that again.
you do, huh? - I do.
Hey, Hirsch.
nice driving, by the way.
Thanks. - I mean, you still got it, buddy.
Yeah, I do, don't I?
Yeah, absolutely.
it was intense. I got a rush.
Hey, I threw up in my mouth.
so, when did you get out, Val?
today.
today? - Yeah.
get the hell out of here.
no. Yeah, ask Doc.
no kidding? - Yeah.
we got sprung on the same day.
it's nice you can share that.
twenty-eight years.
twenty-eight fucking years.
you did your time like a man, Val.
you were stand-up all the way.
but you and Doc would have done the same.
well, I would like to think so.
it's possible. Either way is possible, but you did it, Val.
true.
I can't believe you guys didn't work together all this time.
no. - No, no, no.
Claphands retired us. That was that.
and it was.
he can't forgive himself, so everybody else has got to pay.
so, what do you want to do now that you're out, Val?
I always wanted to finish high school, learn more about the human condition.
how about you, Hirsch?
is there anything in this life that you haven't done that you would like to have a chance to do?
two girls at the same time.
that's very doable. No, Doc?
Yeah, done and done.
back so soon?
one more time, you get the free coffee mug.
Wendy, we'd like you to meet our associate, Richard Hirsch.
how are you doing? - Hello.
he's looking for what is known in French as the menage a trois.
shit.
Oxana's the only one working.
Irena fell down the stairs.
what about you?
me?
no.
I don't do it for money.
well, we won't pay you.
Oh.
excuse me. What's your name?
Wendy.
you're going to have the greatest experience of your life...
it's up to you whether you want to experience that or not.
it's that important to me and that a big deal.
do you promise?
I swear to God.
okay.
but it costs triple.
shouldn't it be double? - Yeah, it should.
doc, if you please.
I guess.
Oxana.
go easy on him, girls.
if I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't believe it.
he would pump it up on a vacuum cleaner.
yeah?
he said, every day, whatever he did, he watched TV, he listened to the radio...
he would attach... You know the attachment on a vacuum cleaner?
what do you call the thing that... - It's a nozzle.
the nozzle.
Yeah, but it's for taking the stuff off the corners of the couch.
I mean, why would you put your dick in that?
it doesn't matter, because it stretched his dick.
and his dick kept getting bigger and bigger...
there's other ways. There's a Chinese thing I heard about.
it's a jar.
they put bees in it.
you put it on your schlong.
the bees bite your dick.
hello.
it gets all swollen, huge.
Yeah, but where do you put it?
I don't know. It's good for show, anyway.
that makes so much sense.
hirsch has been up there a long time.
good for him.
Whoa! Here he comes!
so the pipes still working?
you could put it that way.
Oh!
okay. Jesus, that's enough.
I do not know the English word for what I feel.
Surprise"?
I think it's called "lust," darling.
love. That is close enough. - Good, okay.
I didn't know you had it in you.
I did.
Hirsch. - Hello.
Oh!
okay. All right.
it's like a gum commercial.
you've ruined me for any other man.
it's okay. You'll get over it.
call me. - Bye.
thank you.
Hey, Hirsch, who knew you were a freak in bed?
huh?
wow, you've got to feel great, no?
I don't feel that great.
why the fuck not?
I never went out on my wife before, it makes me feel like a piece of shit.
hirsch hey, for Christ's sake, she's been dead for ages.
we were married for 40 fucking years!
you don't get over that in five minutes.
slow down!
the cops are not following us.
the adrenaline keeps me alert.
if he slows down, he may fall asleep.
what's that?
what the...
was that us? - What was that?
wait a minute.
shit, man. It's the trunk. Someone's in the trunk.
Yeah, yeah. Pull over. - Okay, let's pull over.
that's not good.
it's human-sounding.
we should try it here.
here.
so, we go on three, right?
let go. I'm doing this.
one, two, three!
Oh, man.
get the gag out. Get the gag out.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ!
who was driving?
me. I was driving.
Jesus.
how did you get in this trunk?
I'm on vacation.
what does that mean? - Get me out of here!
okay, okay, take it easy. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
who are you?
I'm a friend of yours. Here.
jeez, man!
my friend?
hirsch, listen.
you're going to have to give me your pants.
Why?
because she's naked. She's going to need something to wear.
I'm not giving her my pants, end of story.
come on. She's got no clothes on. Give her your pants.
if you want to give her some pants, give her your pants.
no, I'm not going to give her my pants.
I gave her my jacket. My pants are important to me.
give me... Come on.
what makes you the arbiter of whose pants are important and whose pants are not important?
you don't need pants!
you sit in the car, driving.
how the fuck do you need pants to drive? - I don't need pants?
I gotta go out and walk around, come on.
I'm not giving her my fucking pants, end of story.
okay. So, that's your final offer?
I'm not making any offers.
okay, plan B. Doc.
sir, how are you doing?
do you sell women's clothing here?
do it look like it?
my friend just asked you a question, a polite question.
could you give him a polite answer?
you no hear so good, old man?
or you just stupid?
do you see that?
Hey, your jab still looks pretty good.
you think so? - Yeah.
I thought I didn't get my hips into it.
no, no, no. You had a nice snap to it.
thanks for saying so.
he's okay.
do you need anything? - Just the check.
I think we should know certain things about her.
Ow.
here she comes.
Hey, look at that, the clothes fit.
do you feel better?
a little. I'm starving.
so, Sylvia. - Mmm.
why don't we continue where we left off?
so I was standing, waiting for a cab.
this car pulls up.
nice car, nice smile.
he asked me if I needed a ride.
I was late, so I said, "Sure.
Wow. You know, you shouldn't accept rides from strangers.
go fuck yourself, all right?
Ooh! - Ah.
okay.
go fuck yourself." I like this girl.
there was another guy in the back seat who I didn't see.
they tied me up, and took me to this warehouse.
there were two other guys there, they were just laughing, whatever.
pretty soon I was naked, and you can figure out the rest.
so, you never saw these guys before?
never.
what, do you think I put myself in the trunk?
how's everybody doing over here?
good. Thank you, Alex.
doc, I didn't know you had so many friends.
me, too.
let me know if I can get you anything else.
I'm fine, thanks.
anyway, I passed out for a while, and woke up naked in the trunk of the car.
now, I'm sitting here with you three with a friggin'
korean janitor outfit on.
I had a dog named Sylvia.
I loved that dog.
I think about her every day.
there's so goddamn much I want to forget.
where was this warehouse?
show me where you found the car, and I'll show you the place.
we stole the car on Rodney Street.
it belongs to the Jargoniew brothers.
total degenerate lowlifes.
animals.
maybe we could do something about this situation.
so what do you guys want to do about it?
what, are you going to fuck them up with a pair of pliers?
it's only the beginning.
holy shit.
who are you guys?
do you remember that?
Oh, my baby.
I've missed you.
Mr. Hirsch.
remember me?
I do this.
what time is it?
I don't know. What time is it?
it's time to kick ass, or chew gum.
and guess what?
I'm all out of gum.
Hey, Val. - Yeah?
it's like the old days, isn't it?
no. It's better.
Yeah. Why?
because this time, we can appreciate it.
Yeah, that's right. That's the reason.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be right here.
okay, if you see the place, you tell us, and then you take off.
okay?
we're just three people, walking down the street.
nothing suspicious.
this is it.
around the corner.
okay.
you need to go home now, Sylvia.
no, I want to watch.
Oh, no, honey.
nobody watches us work.
besides, there may be five or six guys in there, you know.
with just the two of us, it may not turn out the way we would hope.
all right, so what? I can help.
go home, get some rest.
no.
we can't know what's on the other side of that door.
No! No.
I don't think she's going to listen.
no, she seems firm about it.
no, she's not going to leave.
listen, honey.
why don't you wait here about 10 minutes, and then come on in?
why are you doing this for me?
I don't understand the question.
you don't even know me.
that's true.
but I know you, at the same time.
it makes me sick, what they did to you.
they're fucking animals!
there used to be consequences.
exactly.
they think they can do things like this to people, and get away with it.
well, we're the fucking consequences.
and now for my next trick.
give me those picks.
it's probably open.
you're right.
Yeah, man.
Hey, fellows. What's going on?
how the fuck did you get in here?
we're friends of Sylvia.
you remember Sylvia, the naked girl you put in your trunk.
how the fuck do you know about...
all right.
does anybody else want to get shot?
okay.
remember, fellows...you reap what you sow.
Yes. I would like to report a large cache of weapons and drugs.
what's the address here?
it's Rodney Street.
I know that. What number?
Oh, what's the number here?
I asked you a question.
go fuck yourself.
Ooh!
I didn't hear the number.
172
172 Rodney.
thank you so much. Have a great night.
you're your own worst fucking enemy.
shit!
Whoa! Look who's here.
Oh, fuck.
good evening, gentlemen.
remember her?
the belle of the ball.
I think it's time for us to exit.
stage left.
okay, Sylvie.
yeah?
you know, you've got about eight minutes before the cops come.
thank you.
you're welcome.
good luck, fellows.
enjoy.
you guys like the ballet, don't you?
the Nutcracker was my favorite.
here. Here's your gun back.
I got blood all over my jacket.
look at this.
you can wash them.
you use the biological stuff, it takes the stains right out.
what the fuck is that, biological?
I'm telling you, you can take that stain right out.
no, you can't get these stains out.
it doesn't matter how many times you wash them.
a blood stain stays in.
you can't get this fucking stuff out.
we'll get you a new suit.
a new suit? - Yeah.
that's a different conversation.
what's going on here?
what's this?
Hey!
it's always something, isn't it?
Yeah.
but he got his last wish.
Yeah.
we got to work together again.
Yeah.
we got to work together again.
so?
I think we should bury him.
Hirsch.
do you know where Nina Hirsch works?
I think she's over there.
Hey, Nina.
do you remember us?
sure. How's your pecker?
it's all right.
listen, your dad's dead.
what?
we're sorry.
but how do you know he's dead?
we took him for a night out is all, and, well, you know, he died.
where is he?
he's outside in a stolen sports car, in the front seat.
see?
he's still warm.
it didn't happen more than 30 minutes ago.
what were you guys doing?
having fun, just like old times.
he went out with a bang.
is there a family plot or something?
we thought we should bury him.
you...
you want to bury him now?
tonight?
well, for us, it's got to be tonight.
they won't miss this.
we'll give it to you, Hirsch.
here you go, my boy.
I think Hirsch would be glad to be next to your mother.
he bought this plot when I was four.
he told me, "Darling, just come visit me from time to time.
let me know how it's going.
dad, it's going okay.
you taught me that the best thing a person could be is of some use.
you were of so much use to me.
always.
right.
Val, we should say something, too.
would you do it? I'm not good at stuff like this.
Yeah.
okay, I can do it.
hirsch was a good friend.
I remember one time, we robbed this liquor store, and he ran over a dog.
he cried for two days over that dog.
anyway, he will be missed by so many of us that got left behind.
he was a witness to our lives.
not many of those left.
so there's one less person on this Earth who knows our name, who remembers our childhood, who shared in each moment as it passed.
you know, they say we die twice, once when the breath leaves our body, and once when the last person we know says our name.
and then, Hirsch's life will be forgotten, like all the other poor fucks that ever had the glory of living.
Amen.
Amen. - Amen.
what?
nothing. That was really good.
it was good?
the best I ever heard.
you think so?
really good, Val. - Fuck you.
thank you, Valentine.
Yeah, well, it was nothing.
no. Valentine, listen to me.
thank you. - It's okay.
thank you.
good night.
there's nothing you can say about that.
no.
so, are you going to do my eulogy?
I'm working on it.
how much time I got left?
four hours, about.
I could use a steak.
you hungry? - Yeah.
let's go.
and after breakfast, we'll get you a new suit.
Oh.
then you can shoot me in the head, so it doesn't fuck up my suit.
that's right. I shoot you in the head.
thank you. - You're welcome.
look at this, my car is still here.
what, are you surprised?
who's going to want to take that piece of shit?
well, good morning, fellows. - Hi, Alex.
are you two up early, or are you going to bed late?
and what's going on here with all this dirt?
Yeah, well, you know... - Gardening.
we've been doing a spot of late-night gardening.
huh.
Yeah, you should try it some time.
well, look at you, young lady.
you're pulling a long shift tonight, huh?
Yeah. I don't sleep.
I sort of like being awake when everyone else is sleeping, you know?
it gives me a sense of... - Being alive.
Yes.
I know the feeling, believe me.
okay. So, what will it be, Doc?
two eggs over easy.
of course.
and I will have a steak, waffles, a Greek omelet, a Greek salad, and a banana malt.
and another steak.
and a coffee. - And a coffee.
Oh, and a muffin. - And a muffin.
if you don't mind.
I don't mind.
you are a very hungry man, Val.
uh...
I'm leaving on a long trip.
Oh.
just when we were getting to know each other.
Yeah, ain't that too bad?
I'll put that order right in.
Yeah.
I'm going to take a wild guess here, but Alex, the waitress, is your granddaughter, no?
Yes.
you got to tell her.
I'm going to.
yeah?
why haven't you told her already?
I can't.
how come?
you can.
believe me.
the truth will set you free, brother.
okay, but not today.
then when?
tomorrow.
tomorrow? Do you promise?
tomorrow, I'll tell her everything.
okay, tomorrow.
my last meal.
Yeah.
don't go sentimental on me now.
excuse me.
there you go.
thank you.
so, Val?
so, Alex.
do you mind if I sit?
no. Go ahead, please.
so Doc comes in here every morning, you know.
Mmm-hmm.
and he always orders the same exact thing.
Oh, the tyranny of habit.
it's me.
is it done?
what is he like?
I can't help but wonder about most of my customers, but I wonder about him the most.
I don't know.
what do you imagine he's like?
please. Mercy, is all I'm saying. Mercy.
I know it was your only son.
I know what that must be like. - "Please"?
please"?
please bring back my only son!
see how far "please" gets you!
we're all out of mercy here.
Why?
he'll be dead soon enough. Just give him a few more years.
what's the difference?
what is the fucking difference?
how's Alex, fuckface?
what?
Alex. You know who I'm talking about.
I bet you my left nut you can see the bitch right this second.
it would be a fucking shame, to see such a young hottie get into, an awful accident.
a fucking waste, yeah?
you wouldn't.
Oh, really?
are you sure?
I imagine he's a man who knows what it's like to be alone, to live life with a lot of regret, and that maybe he comes here every day just to be around other people, even if it's only for a half an hour, just to be around people.
that's right, that's exactly right.
sometimes, what we imagine, and the world aren't different things.
sometimes, they're the same exact thing.
Yeah.
I thought so.
finish this, fucknut, or accidents can and will happen.
I think your food is ready.
I wish we could have talked more, Val.
me, too. It was nice sitting here with you.
Yeah, it was.
is the church open?
church is always open.
Yeah.
so, do you start or do I start?
I forgot. - You do.
I do. Right, okay.
so, forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
how long since your last confession?
um...
sixty years, give or take a few.
okay.
now, confess each and every serious sin that separates you from Christ.
Oh, no. We'd be here forever, Father.
can we just deal with what happened today?
so far, I shot a guy in the kneecap, and one in the arm.
I stole a bunch of prescription drugs, and a sweet-ass car.
punched a Korean store clerk in the face, took his clothes, and fucked a Russian hooker four times.
that was all today?
uh...
since noon yesterday, yeah.
but I did some good things, too, Father.
I buried a friend.
I helped this young woman take her life back.
and...I eased my best friend's pain.
and for 28 years, I kept my mouth shut.
so, can I say a Hail Mary and be done here?
no, I don't think that you're going to be able to, Hail Mary your way out of this one.
you're right.
you're right, I guess.
I'm wasting both our time.
here. Go ahead.
why don't you take this?
what's that? - This is for your troubles.
no. - Buy yourself a steak dinner or something.
but I can't. - Take it, Father.
I don't need it where I'm going.
what?
so?
did you receive absolution?
well, close enough.
let's go see about those suits.
you want to hurry up?
what about this one?
what?
am I going to play a game of shuffleboard?
come on, let's be serious here.
okay. - Looking for the suit. Find the suit.
this one.
what size is it?
Forty-two, long.
I wear 40 regular.
Hey.
you said no crying.
no crying for you.
we didn't say anything about me.
okay. Hey, this one.
it's beautiful. Look at this.
it will look great on you.
clothes just hang off you the right way.
you think so? - Definitely.
why don't you try one on?
no, I'm okay.
your wardrobe could use a little help.
you think?
uh, yeah. I wasn't going to say anything, but...
yeah? But what?
but you dress, like you're on your way to the gin rummy championship of the world.
here.
no, I prefer black.
you're right. Black suits you.
here's black.
what do you think?
I can't see myself wearing that every day.
I don't see myself in it.
will you look at these guys, Paul?
look at them!
they're trying on clothes.
you're fucking shopping?
what?
what do you mean, "What?
isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing?
you know, Claphands had you figured, Doc.
he said you don't got the stones anymore.
Whoa!
Larry, please.
before you do this, there's one thing you should know.
here, here!
you.
call Claphands.
tell him, "Stay out of my action.
I got this.
okay.
go.
nice work.
in the old days,
I would have had him with the throat punch.
you gotta admit, it felt good, though, didn't it?
damn right.
it felt good.
Oh, look at you. You look great.
no. You look great.
do I? - Yeah.
well, I feel great.
that's what I'm saying. A change of wardrobe, can be just the thing.
definitely. - Yeah.
may I?
be my guest.
boom. - Whoa.
fuck!
did you see that? - I did.
it was good, though. I got my hips in it.
he's still alive.
so.
what time is it?
it's time.
already?
I'm sorry.
well, it had to come, didn't it?
it did.
time waits for no man.
it doesn't.
hmm.
I'm going to miss the spring.
and my flowers.
the birds returning.
their song.
the whole world, you know, renewing itself again.
your fucking face.
see.
this didn't feel weird. Did it?
no.
hello. - Alex.
what do you think of my sunrises?
I think they're beautiful.
I wanted you to know some of the things I thought, saw, some of the things I felt.
I do.
I know they look like the sunrise, but I was painting you.
in the closet, on the top shelf, there's a shoebox.
put the phone down. Open it. I'll wait. No rush.
okay.
doc, this is too much.
no, it's all there is.
welcome home. The rent is paid for a year.
it's not much, but it's yours.
what do you mean? When am I going to see you again?
I don't know.
I love you, Alex.
grandpa.
I love you, too.
I have to go now.
are you sure you want to do this?
you can change your mind, you know.
I know, but I won't.
you took care of Alex?
I'm so proud of you for that.
tomorrow became today.
it usually does.
so?
what will it be?
chew gum or kick ass?
I'm all out of gum.
get me a gun!
I like that shirt.
who's staring now?
Oh, it's the same people.
now I know how lindsay lohan feels.
well, you're not that drunk.
they're just getting used to it.
they've seen us come in here together a million times...
just not together together.
Coliments of tactical.
so, how long do you give it?
I don't know; she's pretty smart.
I figure another week.
Hey, guys, thanks for the drink. Hey, you want to join us?
no, uh, we, uh, figured we'd leave you two alone.
we were thinking about spicing it up a little bit, maybe getting a threesome going.
Hi, boss.
Oh, no, come on, no, I just came by to drop off some kudos for our successful negotiation of the bakersfield prison riot.
Hey, why don't you join us?
no, no, my days at sloan's are far behind me, thank you.
come on, none of that "I'm not going to drink with the grunts" crap.
Yeah, exactly-- it wasn't that long ago you used to be one of the grunts.
good point.
okay, one drink.
that wasn't even the craziest one.
Oh, no, no.
the craziest one-- we are into a foot chase, running down this alley.
full-on '70s cop mode, okay?
the perp decides to hop a fence into somebody's backyard.
right, so matt goes around the front.
I follow him over the fence and drop in front of the most evil, vicious doberman in all of east L. A.
come on!
you let her go over there alone?
you know how scad he is of dogs.
you're scared of dogs?
no, I'm not scar, I'm mindful.
Yeah, right.
he got attacked by a pack of dogs when he was a kid.
you were on your way to what-- the cub scouts, what was...
no, little league. Right, little league!
right. He got attacked, he's been afraid ever since.
so I'm thinking about that while I'm looking at this doberman, and I start backing into the fence, right?
and right next to me...is the guy.
and he looks at me, I look at him, and he's like,"uh, so, uh, I'm ready to negotiate now.
okay, andrea, time's up.
please, paul.
no more "please, paul.
I get you home late again, your dad's going to kill me.
yeah
david lau, I have your daughter.
her driver paul is dead, she is alive.
do you understand?
I was just...
Yeah, I understand.
listen carefully.
no, you listen.
you don't know who you're talking to.
you hurt her, I swear to god I will kill you and I will have your family killed.
voice: Pacific turtle fund, caiman islands,$12. 2 million liquid.
I know exactly who I'm talking to.
you want to see your daughter alive again, you'll pay the ransom in full.
[Organized Crime Ray Jamison]
I'll call back in two hours.
have the wire ready.
what do we do, ray?
I mean, we have to report this to crisis negotiation, right?
I mean, it's a kidnapping.
they took his kiD.
this trumps our case.
right?
the kidnappers have set a two-hour window every second we continue to argue this, we lose time.
we need to intercede now, take over ransom negotiation.
losing time?
how about losing a year...of investigation into a major organized crime target?
ray, how about we take it down a level?
we're on same side here
no, we're on different sides of the same case.
david lau is the los angeles point man for an international criminal enterprise.
I want lau's connections-- toronto, hong kong.
I've chewed my way through two months of red tape to get a legal intercept on the sat phone, and you're telling me to blow our surveillance because someone grabs his kid?
he hasn't even reported a crime!
he won'T.
crime bosses do not call the cops for help.
it's probably what the kidnappers are counting on.
ray, and I know you're going to nail this guy, but right now, there's a ten-year-old girl at risk and she's got priority.
so make your surveillance available to the crisis negotiation unit.
I think you're making a mistake.
we'd better get started.
we're losing time.
five minutes.
david lau has made several calls to known associates for help in the last hour.
you may be walking into a crowded room.
Roger that.
Matt, cheryl was way out in front on this one.
Yeah, always was.
Yeah, you know her pretty well, don't you?
Yeah, well, partners for 12 years. You get to know somebody.
you guys were a great team.
a lot of the research from my training guide was based on some of the cases you worked together.
we never hooked up. I never said you did.
no, but it'd be a reasonable assumption.
why, because she knows you're afraid of dogs?
because she is hot.
here we are.
looks like the gang's all here.
Yeah, literally.
FBI, can we speak to david lau please?
he's not home. Aah, that's too bad.
can we come in?
I said,"he's not home.
well, I guess you're going to have to tell him we're here anyway.
david lau, we are not here for you.
we are here to help andrea.
failure to report a kidnapping is a federal offense, even if it's your own daughter that's been taken.
it's the fbi.
how do they know?
come on, please.
you said this phone couldn't be tapped.
you said it was golden!
look, we can get a warrant, kim!
but by that time, it's going to be too late.
they...
they haven't called back yet.
can we come in?
why don't you invite us in?
easy, boys.
stay right where you are.
officer: Hey, hey, hey, you heard him.
stay.
Hey, this is my house.
all right, everybody settle down.
Mrs. Lau asked us in.
listen, we all know what's going on here.
we're not here to arrest or question anyone outside of the kidnapping.
Yeah, we know what you're going through and we know how to help, so why don't you give us the phone and let us take the next call?
David, please, just let them help.
I need to talk to my wife alone for a minute.
well, you've got two.
that's not our deadline.
so, you guys, all just...
friends of the fam, right?
I'm sorry. I want her back.
I don't care what happens to us.
I told you I'm taking care of it.
how?
this is a move against me, kim.
I know who did this.
who?
you mean someone you know?
I'm going to get her back and not to fbi.
I'm taking care of it, okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I let them in.
it's okay.
they're not going to stop me.
I'll use them and buy time.
the call's coming in.
step back.
that's right decision hello?
voice: Who is this?
this is matt. Who's this?
put dad on the phone.
no, you don't get dad.
you don't get mom, you don't get anything without talking to me.
you a cop?
FBI, which means I should inform you that kidnapping for profit in the united states is a ticket to the death penalty.
you return andrea, that's one less headache you have to worry about.
he sends the money, or the girl dies.
she gets hurt, you get nothing.
that's it.
we were running a trace.
which we are. Lea?
no trace.
the guy's using a scrambler and a high-end voice modulator.
all right, well, which one can you crack first?
gun to my head?
the voice.
I could isolate the algorithms, see if I could score a print.
right. Sorry.
how do you know he'll call back?
the thing he's made most clear.
I want you to give these guys their space to work.
we'll call you later.
that's better.
you have no idea who's behind this.
no, not yet.
we're kind of hoping you might.
and you seem to know some pretty tough people, so chances are you might know someone who'd like to hurt you?
I own a chain of laundromats.
well, maybe a rival laundromat is trying to, uh, muscle you out of the fluff-and-fold business.
excuse me.
Yeah.
try and remember he's the victim here.
he's not acting like it.
well, he's not going to tell us who his enemies are. We're one of them.
I mean, they've got to have a classified file on him.
no, forget that. We'd have to go through ray jamison.
that's the guy whose case we deep-sixed coming down here.
I don't think he's going to give us squat.
I need you help.
my team has inserted themselves into the ransom negotiations, and we're trying to get a line on the kidnappers.
now, we think it's someone lau knows.
and so you need my files and all my casework?
I could probably sacrifice a couple of informants if you'd like to.
I could go straight to hilton, have him order you to turn over all your assets, but I'd rather save you the embarrassment and me the time.
so I'm asking you, directly and discreetly.
case number and my password.
thank you.
no. Thank you.
you're absolutely right.
give me dick lanstate at the department of justice, and tell them to pull him out of whatever he's doing.
according to the o. C.D. The big circle boys have natural competitors, but not a lot of rivals, and they work closely with other gangs.
not likely. They're all super loyal.
what about someone who used to be inside?
is there anyone on the discard pile who got kicked off the roster?
suspect, multiple homicides.
used to muscle for lau until they had a falling out about two years ago.
left bcb to form his own outfit.
for these guys, getting fired is worse than getting whacked.
so, he'd have motive, and he'd know about the offshore account.
you want us to roll on him?
I want you to wait and watch until you can confirm that the girl is in pocket.
keep him on the phone for us.
Yeah.
this is matt.
voice: Hello, matt.
let's try this again.
Hey, thanks for calling back.
you're doing the right thing.
so, you know my name.
what should I call you?
call me sir
Yes, sir.
I don't buy lau calling the fbi.
you had him on satellite surveillance, am I right?
that's a fair assumption, sir.
Yeah, I'm in position.
we got vehicles out front.
there's no visible sentries.
I got second floor greasy windows.
possible objective.
how about we sneak a gps on one of those cars?
get arsems to track them so we don't have to worry about keeping a tail if we need to follow.
Arsems, huh?
you just want an excuse to call that mathers chick, don't you?
what can I say, man? She likes me.
looks like they went and got bigger guns.
they must be thinking the same thing we are.
not good.
man, what's the call?
let's make this simple. We talk money, or we don't talk.
are you authorized to represent the family or not?
what does he mean?
he means, can we bargain with your money?
no.
what?
no.
we're not talking money until we get proof of life.
I want to hear andrea.
I want to see her.
fair enough.
5179 hudson.
check the mail.
we'll talk in one hour.
5179 hudson. Damn it.
we're on hudson.
shoot me, bitch.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't believe you.
drop 'em!
Where's the girl, russell?
what girl?
david lau's working with the fbi now?
what the hell's going on?
don't touch the mailbox!
it's pol's what?!
what?
Yeah.
just busted your boys trying to take out russell tze.
apparently we both came to the same conclusion.
I think it's fair we're both wrong.
Yeah.
lab confirms.
it's definitely an instant photo, not digital.
it has not been altered in any way.
Thanks.
so, what do you think?
I think they've done this before, I think they're pros.
it's big business in latin america, asia.
half a billion dollars a year big.
why haven't I heard of this?
ask your husband.
his friends overseas like to dabble in it from time to time.
sometimes the goal is terror.
sometimes politics, but mostly, it's money.
is that this is california, it's not columbia.
well, sure, your typical k&r targets a-a business exec with a fat insurance policy, but david's different, because david's not going to call the cops.
he doesn't want to report the theft.
so...
what do we do?
Emily: They call back in a half hour, we say we pay them the 12 million.
we can't.
what do you mean you can't?
what do you mean you can't?
this is andrea.
it's not my money.
do you understand?
I touch it, and we're dead.
we're never gonna be safe.
it's okay.
you're not expected to come up with the first number that they ask for.
they're going to start high, and then work their way down.
but now, some of that money's got to be yours.
how much?
one, five.
all right, one point five.
Yeah, I can get him there.
I can get him there.
there he is.
all right.
ready?
Yeah.
okay.
Yeah.
are we ready to talk yet?
Oh, we're ready to talk.
we're going to be talking english, though.
see, when you say to me $12. 2 million, to me that's klingon.
I haven't heard a better number.
better number would be seven, as in, uh,$700, 000, which, if you think about it
$700, 000 won't buy you the location of the corpse.
$12. 2.Million.
Yeah, well, david lau's not as rich as you seem to think he is.
the money in that account-- that's not his.
that's his problem.
below $10 million.
Hey, fowler?
what?
I already said what.
you want out of the deal, there's the door.
we agreed if there was heat, this is good heat.
FBI talker's a pro.
negotiator.
it's his job to make this work.
he won't let emotion get in the way.
shut it, shut it.
Hey, matt, can I talk to you for a second?
what's up?
okay i don't have an answer yet, but this profile doesn't feel right to me.
your typical pro kidnapper is uneducated, illiterate, and uses basic equipment to communicate.
uh, dead drops and cb radios.
not high-end voice modulators and digital scramblers.
our guy is educated, well-spoken, and calm.
he-he doesn't yell.
I mean, we've heard the k&r tapes.
they scream, they yell, they threaten.
for the line about buying the location of the corpse.
no. Boilerplate.
it's standard escalation tactic.
it's textbook.
I've read it in a textbook.
it's-it's almost like somebody who studied professional kidnappers.
he didn't say "her corpse.
he said "the corpse.
he calls her "the package.
I mean, he should be using her name.
that's what these guys do-- they try and make it personal.
ey're calling back.
you just tell them I'm willing to give up everything I got.
I can get six million. Six million?
I'll convert my stocks, sell my house.
all right. Matt, let me take the call.
please. My partner gets a little worked up.
Hello, sir, this is matt's partner.
I want a new proof of life.
I already gave you that.
no, you gave me a photo.
I want to hear andrea's voice, and I want to hear it now.
well, that's going to cost you.
cut the crap. Put her on, or we all go home empty-handed.
who is this? Who am I?
I'm a professional negotiator, just like you are.
or were.
uh, my guess is you worked for one of the big risk management firms, maybe as a k&r consultant or a field negotiator.
hang up. shut up.
I'm guessing you're ex-law or ex-military-- am I right?
you want to know who I am?
Yeah, and I'm the woman with your money.
back off.
listen, sir, I'm really sorry about that, okay?
my partner gets a little worked up.
it's the stress.
good-bye, matt.
six million, okay?
six million.
family doesn't care who you are.
they just want andrea back.
I already told you, nothing below ten.
this is a good number.
okay? And you know it.
please, sir, work with me on this, all right?
six million.
he's not going to go any higher than that.
he can'T.
well, matt, we both know that's not true, but I will take it to my people.
when can I expect to hear back from you?
one hour.
nice.
Thanks.
okay.
well, that's neW.
aggressive attack to provoke an honest response from a closed subject.
Yeah, followed by an immediate concession to, uh, shake him up a little bit.
sort of like a slap and a kiss.
I like it.
what's the plan?
I don't like it.
think about how many k&r shops there are worldwide.
we're a needle in a haystack.
and we're about to close this.
here's how it's going to work.
we talk money, buy time.
next call, I drop to $9 million.
they'll counter.
meanwhile, we are checking risk firms, cross-referencing their roster with our new profile.
then we send them a piece of the girl and drop to $8 million, which is what we thought we'd get.
find out who's been fired, who quit, who burned out.
no obvious mutilation, not to start-- a, uh...
a pinky toe.
they'll pay right away.
I'll do it.
we may need to stall with a down payment.
how much?
how much can you get in the next half hour?
david lau, you're under arrest.
drug trafficking, pandering and extortion.
Hey, what the hell is this?
Emily: We're in the middle of a ransom negotiation.
not anymore.
as of this moment, you're op is shot down.
under whose authority?
the dep justice
the edict's been overruled.
I have authorization to detain lau until he flips for us.
gives up his overseas connections.
he gives us names, you resume negotiations, not before.
go to hell.
we are.
you're coming with.
wait. No, please.
just-just not now.
this is extortion.
no, this is hardball.
Hey, lea, listen, it's me. Okay?
listen very carefully.
get out the way
great.
now we're taken hostages.
listen. I'm just as frustrated as you are, but jamison's got justice convinced that lau's thing is a huge win.
it's the only leverage they got on this guy.
and andrea lau is collateral damage.
I got washington to put a time limit on it.
jamison's got two hours to crack lau.
then we cut him loose, and you're back in business.
in two hours, we could lose her.
time to eat.
No!
you don't want to starve, do you?
my dad is going to kill you.
you know that your daddy is not a good man, right?
now, he's taken people, just like I took you.
just remember that.
you're in this tub because of your father.
if I wasn't cuffed to this table...
you'd what?
I give up those names, my family dies.
my we, my daughter, my relatives back home, dead.
that won't happen.
I will make sure you get out of here to pay the ransom.
andrea gets home safe and sound.
everybody goes into witness protection provided you testify.
or we could just sit here.
cause unlike you, I've got all the time in the world.
you okay if I leave you for a second?
okay.
be right back.
I'm going to take kim back to the office.
I'm surprised these clowns didn't confiscate her.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not his.
that's ours.
you guys won't be needing it.
I'm kind of sentimental.
Hey, matt, we'll get it later.
what are you, on their side now?
fighting them is a waste of time.
we're getting a call in 30 minutes, and we've got a job to do.
how are we going to work? We're shut down.
well, for starters, we can forward the calls from lau's phone to our office.
Yeah, that would have been a great idea five minutes ago.
Yeah, thanks. That's when I did it.
you are so hot right now.
I know.
we have to tell cheryl, right?
that she'd want plausible deniability?
considering we're countermanding a D. O.J. Order?
no, she's going to want a heads up on this.
all right, I was afraid you'd say that.
I'll talk to her. I know how to handle it.
you want continued negotiations off book?
I want to get the girl back.
did it ever occur to you that I might be risking my job?
I'm prioritizing.
remember antoine chandler?
Wh'd you do?
57 hours in, okay?
and maybe another five before we get him to walk out of that house...
Matt, what did you do?
he sends tactical in.
and you got in that huge fight with him right in front of everybody, 'cause he says antoine's not worth another hour, and-and you call him trigger-happy, and he's about ready to shoot both of us.
until antoine suddenly surrendered.
Yeah.
because we put the mic in my pocket and broadcast the entire fight into his ear.
what's your point?
my point is, is that we did the right thing and it worked.
maybe work again.
okay.
uh, so the kidnappers can't raise lau, and they call fbi hotline and ask for you.
what if, uh, the satellite phone had already been set to forward the calls here?
did you do that without asking me?
I'm asking you now.
you think you can work around jamison?
Yeah. Jamison's already got what he wants.
that was smart.
smart forwarding the calls before you left.
and yet you kept her out of here.
well, I didn't want to compromise her image of you.
Yeah.
next up is abner sestock.
he was just fired from enterprise business risk management last month.
they're out of miami.
so, you're jealous? Jealous?
it's just, we've been partners for over a year, dating for three months.
wouldn't you think I'd know he's afraid of dogs?
well, she is hot.
is it just 'cause he said that?
said what?
um, the...
excerpt from kidnap negotiation.
no, no. They don't have that much.
Hey, this is a middle income family.
exxon's not paying the rent.
not him.
how can you tell?
one down, 1,200 more to go.
Really?
wow, that'S...
who's our go-to guy for interrogations, and I mean, when we really need to crack somebody open?
uh, we usually get someone from the crisis negotiation unit.
didn't you say that david lau's people were into kidnapping?
among other things, yeah.
okay, so we're figuring that sir was a negotiator, as in lau kidnapped somebody?
well, maybe. Or, I don't know, ran the operation.
maybe it wasn't reported.
they could have taken him to mexico. We wouldn't have followed him there.
in any case, it would be a connection between lau and...
God, I hate calling him sir.
we're not going to get it out of sir, and right now they're holding lau where we can't even ask him.
am I, uh, interrupting something?
no.
we try it every time we get shut down.
it's a phone call for you. it's cheryl.
uh, what do you need?
Oh, cheryl.
Yeah. Transfer that to my desk.
Hello, sir.
six million didn't fly.
can we get serious?
always.
you know how it is.
no, matt. How what is?
Hey, flannery, I got a question.
look, I don't know who you are, okay, but I know what you are.
what I don't get is why you switched sides. What happened?
you're working ransom negotiations one day, and you just figure the grass is greener on the other side of the phone?
you know, this might be a public service for you, but for me, it's business.
nine million.
it's never just business.
six, three, five.
you want me to interrogate david lau?
the quicker you give me a name, the sooner you go back to work.
it seems to work for me.
okay.
let's go.
let me tell you what I don't get.
negotiating on behalf of a man you're trying to put away.
but our goal is exactly the same.
Matt, I'm offering you a way to bring down david lau.
why don't we clean out the son of a bitch together.
Oh, you mean turn you and me into "we," like negotiation 101?
Yeah, well, neither will stalling for time.
all right, well fine, let's quit dinking around if it's a real number, I'll make it happen.
what are you, the next wave?
I'm here to show you a way out.
yeah right, like jameson did.
I'm not like him.
you're all the same.
look, david, I can help you, but you have to help me.
I'm not giving anyone up.
okay, then tell me about a kidnapping.
one that you did.
what the hell is she talking about?
this is just about you, you don't have to give anybody else up, but I have to have his name.
I don't know what you're talking about.
look, jameson's going to be in here any second and we are not going to get another chance.
you have to decide who is more important.
andrea or you.
all right, one name! That's all I need. That's enough.
I said, let's go!
if this isn't about my case, I don't want to hear it.
damn it, ray, it's her only chance.
zolie jung, southern sea shipping company.
well, you wanted a name...
there's two.
last may, in los angeles, under order from the mainland.
Oliver tong and zolie jung.
both work for the south sea shipping company.
big circle boys wanted south seas to go to work for them, smuggling heroin along the golden triangle.
the kidnap and ransom were contracted out to lawnsdale security.
a risk management firm.
the lead negotiator was liam fowler.
quit lawnsdale security say six months ago.
Fowler works with two associates.
british merc named john ross and his secondary's an ex-marine, michael hendricks.
the flight attendant, right now on her way to australia.
with a home address in van nuys.
it's the only los angeles conntion between the three. We think the girl's there, we need to move in within the next hour, or they can all be gone, and andrea could be dead.
and you all did this...investigating, on your own?
because it's good.
go.
over here's clear.
Bravo in position.
three tangos in the living room.
phone is on the coffee table.
straight angle to the front door.
no sight of hostage.
we hold, until we verify location.
Yeah, maybe we should give her one, hey?
oy, darling?
fancy a little light jager then, eh?
confirm hostage.
there she is.
bathroom off the living room.
she's alive, repeat, she's alive sitting low in a tub.
feed is live.
alpha, go.
alpha in position, make thcall.
hello there.
Liam home?
it's for you.
FBI, drop your weapon!
drop the weapon!
okay, that's what i call a happy ending.
good to know.
I like that.
and yet I feel a distance between us.
that bad?
it's not that exciting.
I don't care about your dog story.
you don't care about my dog story.
I mean i do, It's just...
I know you and cheryl were partners for a long time.
come on.
you know that there's stuff that you keep from me.
what do you mean? Like personal stuff.
like guys you were with or some girl you had an experiment with in college or the boy band phase.
whatever. Right? Am I right?
Yeah, you have secrets.
and you know it.
you don't tell me 'cause you like me.
and not quite sure how I'd react.
is this some backwards way of saying that you like me?
not afraid.
I'm just aware.
so, when did you...decide to keep secrets from me?
I don't know. A couple days after we met.
something like that.
what?
nothing.
nothing.
it's pressure, you know?
pressure?
I can't say that to them, 'cause they just think my life's great, like it comes easy for me.
Really?
Yeah, you know why? They're jealous.
I mean, if we're bein' honest here, Matt, they are seething with envy.
and you know what's sick is, I'm-I'm jealous of them.
and they can't see that?
they can't!
and the fans...
the fans of the show, they think I am Pastor Jim.
like I can solve their problems. Uh-huh.
write me suicidal letters... You wanna talk about pressure?
I mean, how would you deal with pressure like that, huh, Matt?
you'd need a release. Anyone would.
Hey, Rick, can you hear that?
Yeah, it's me.
my battery's dyin'.
do you have another one with you?
I don't know.
there might be another one around the car here somewhere.
good, 'cause I wouldn't wanna lose ya.
battery, battery, battery, battery... Battery!
gridlock downtown this morning in Los Angeles.
our situation hours long...
put your headphones back on.
...are still held up in this car.
complete shock, obviously, to the audience who watches him faithfully every single week.
Oh, absolutely.
but I think commuters who've been forced to just evacuate their cars would say this affects them even more.
well, Jim, there's no doubt the police are taking this very seriously.
from what we've been able to learn, this all stemmed from a custody battle over their two boys.
pat, that's right. Once again, what began over four hours ago when Rick Keesler's SUV rear-ended another vehicle has ballooned into a hostage standoff after Keesler fired his handgun at the surrounding motorists.
this guy hates his image.
okay? Maybe a scandal can change that, open up new opportunities.
Mm-hmm. It's manipulation.
he's looking for a way out of the car.
he's been self-rationalizing for the last hour and he just plugged in his charger for more.
and he wants to hang on to what he's got.
right.
Hey, you're doing great, okay?
keep listening, keep him talking.
you've almost got him.
manipulation.
all units, Code Four.
affirmative, Bravo, sniper has shot.
Charlie, moving into position.
okay, Matt. You there?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here, Rick.
do you wanna know another secret?
here's one.
I didn't even want this job.
you didn't want to star in Heartland?
airbag sensor's here, so it's gotta be tight.
is that it, Frank?
you're just gonna shoot Rick Keesler, call it a day?
have you seen him act?
that's great. You know what's gonna be even better is when you blow his brains all over his son.
relax, Emily.
R. O.E. is non-lethal.
Oh, right, non-lethal, with a sniper rifle?
well, if you can keep him talkin'...
this is Cheryl's call?
Charlie in position.
Charlie, stand by for go.
take your positions.
I'm just a real guy.
real desire, real pain and real... thoughts.
from what we can tell, it looks like the authorities have positioned a sharpshooter on the roof of a nearby hotel.
if that indeed is the case, that means...
Matt, what's going on? What are you doin'?
I'm just sitting here in the car, Rick. Why? What...
you said they wouldn't come after me. You promised.
now hey, hey, nobody's coming after ya.
don't lie to me!
I don't give a happy hump who they are, get them out of my airspace!
Cheryl, negotiator's here.
what? What the hell are you doing here? I'm begging you to hold off on tactical. We're ready to go.
we can negotiate a surrender. Come on, the guy is coked out of his mind! We are gonna get the kids, okay?
Matt is wearing him down.
Really?
just one minute!
you won't even give me that!
sounds like it.
all right.
you wanna play it that way, we'll play it that way.
nobody is trying to play anything, Rick.
Hey, hey, Rick?
look, I told you I just needed one minute to think.
all right, Rick, Rick.
just one minute!
you won't even give me that!
listen, Rick.
dad!
Henry, shut up!
no, Rick.
you shut up!
all right?
I been listening to you for the last three hours now. It's your turn.
what? You think you're the first guy who ever messed up, got caught cheating on his wife, he's worried about losin' his kids or his job?
you know nothing about...
the hell I don't! I'm
I'm right here, I'm a person.
like everybody, I got problems.
I got secrets that could hurt me.
negotiator in HD's line of fire.
I'm sleepin' with my partner, for one.
now I realize that that might not sound like a big deal to you but where I work, that's a big deal.
I could lose my job for that.
so could she.
I've been getting away with it.
we've been doing it for three months now.
we had sex at the office once.
but that's out over the radio now.
everybody knows.
my boss, Cheryl, she's gonna be asking me for my resignation tomorrow.
even if she doesn't, the guys that I work with, hell, they're never gonna let me live this down.
I'm not saying that my problems are more important than yours.
you understand?
I'm just saying that you and I share the same basic truth, Rick.
life's gonna change.
I don't know about you, but that scares the hell out of me.
cause I hate change.
I avoid change like the plague.
all right? Not that my life is great...
cause it's not...
but I don't need it to get any worse.
that's out of my hands now, Rick.
cause I can't go back now.
you understand me?
I can't go back to the way that it was.
no matter what you read or what anybody tells you...
I did this for you guys.
come on, come on.
what?
Hey, where were you last night?
Hey. Oh, I was at home.
nice suit.
so is your phone not working or did you just not want to answer it?
Hi, Emily.
Hi, Matt.
I've got your RSIMS log and your incident chronology right here.
and can I just say congratulations on yesterday?
Thanks, Lia, I'll read it upstairs.
Oh.
okay.
see you up there.
Oh, my God.
are you smiling?
look, I'm sorry, okay?
I got home, I was tired,
I had a couple of beers, and I crashed.
otherwise, I would have called.
I really didn't think you'd be this upset.
okay, what the hell is wrong with you?
what?
8: 00 a. m. Five minutes.
Cheryl's office. We are about to get killed.
and it's your fault.
are you upset about work?
I don't think we should be seen walking in together.
I'm gonna take the stairs.
is that why you're wearing a suit?
you're overreacting.
I know Cheryl.
Cheryl doesn't care what we say as long as we get the job done and save the day and nobody files a lawsuit.
so, uh, that's your defense?
no, that's my job.
that's me, and that's not gonna change.
cause you hate change, right?
now what is that supposed to mean?
your words. You tell me.
no, with the tone there.
what's the tone about?
forget it! We'll talk about it later.
what? I felt like I was losing the guy, okay?
tactical was gonna lose their shot.
I had to do something to stall him and shock him.
God, you really don't get it, do you?
Yeah, I get it. Sure, you're, you're mad because you feel like I betrayed your trust and I endangered your job.
no, it... it's not about work, Matt.
okay, what's it about?
change scares the hell out of you?
I mean, you don't need your life to get any worse?
h-how do you think that made me feel?
okay, uh, I think you're right.
I think we should talk about this later.
I'll meet you up there.
Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't.
see, this is the problem right here.
you can share your deepest hopes and fears with a heavily-armed psychopath for hours on end, but get you alone...
please don't analyze me, Emily.
I have no choice.
unless you tell me, I can only guess what you're feeling.
you know, it's not that complicated.
it doesn't mean that I can explain it. Fine.
no analysis.
I just want to know what you're thinking right now.
no, you don't.
Yeah, I do.
I'm wondering if the last time we had sex is gonna be the last time we had sex.
Oh, we heard everything.
Uh-huh.
Cheryl: We have a problem.
out of 340 negotiators in the C. I.R. G. the two of you rank in the top five.
you can see why I would hate to break up a team like that.
sex in the office?
look, I felt I was losing the guy.
how long were we partners, Matt?
I've heard all your lines.
well, almost all of them.
come on, Cheryl. Ma'am.
ms. Carrera.
supervisor Carrera.
Seriously?
you think just because I'm sitting behind this desk now that you can get away with anything?
you, Matt, can get away with less.
Emily, frankly, I'm shocked that you let this happen.
ma'am, I understand your concern and I...
I know you do.
because you say so, right here, in your Crisis Negotiation Training Guide.
page 36, middle of the page.
do you remember what you wrote?
the primary...
the primary negotiator is vulnerable to emotional bias, due to their direct contact with the subject.
it, thus, falls to the secondary to maintain a clear sense of judgment and to keep the primary focused on the objective.
a clear sense of judgment.
how does that work when you're sleeping together?
cause I looked, I did, but I couldn't find that part.
but let's see.
ma'am, your point is well taken.
flannery and I have discussed the matter and we have decided to terminate any personal relationship outside of the office.
okay.
you know I encourage the unit to hang out.
I'm not saying you can't socialize...
no, I think what Lehman's trying to say here is that, uh, the reason we didn't bring this forward is 'cause, as far as we were concerned, there was no relationship.
it was just sex.
although we understand your confusion, seeing as it lasted three months. Two and a half, really.
three and a week.
in the interest of full disclosure.
I'm glad we're all on the same page.
open minds, gentlemen.
I want to see open minds.
cease fire!
special Agent Flannery.
you got a minute, or am I interrupting playtime?
something troubling you, Matt?
Nah, I'm having a great day.
yesterday, could've used a little help, though.
Oh, come on, you gotta admit, the airbag shot.
that was cool.
Yeah, you know what I thought was really cool, was when our hostage-taker saw you aiming a sniper rifle down his throat, after I spent two hours convincing him that wouldn't happen.
that was unfortunate.
but, as you know...
I can't go back.
I can't go back.
you know, maybe if your secondary spent more time with you and less eavesdropping on our communications, you wouldn't be left hanging.
Yeah, man, you gotta keep that bitch on a leash.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He will kill you.
Yeah, what's your point?
what, are you in love with her?
let's settle this in the kill house.
eight ball! Eight ball!
hill's gotta score on you three times.
you only got to hit him once.
let's go.
Yeah!
okay, last week, we reviewed the wide variety of incidents that fall under the auspices of crisis negotiations.
this includes barricaded subject, kidnapping, bomb threats, stalking crimes and high-risk warrants.
today, we will, uh, , cover the technique of...active listening as applied to abnormal psychology.
but, you know what? Let's, let's, let's first talk about the root of our problem.
at the heart of every crisis lies a broken relationship.
defining the nature of that shattered bond could be the key to a successful negotiation, even if the relationship in question is impossible to repair.
so...
can I talk to you for a second?
uh...
what's wrong, hon?
eh, nothing.
I think I left my phone in the car.
well, go get it.
might even wait for you.
Hi, what can I get started for you?
Matt, this is crazy. I'm in the middle of a class.
Yeah, well, it'll just take a minute.
then why do we have to come across the street?
cause I need a clear space, okay?
and I think you need to know how it feels.
how what feels?
how it feels to have somebody just make a decision that affects your career without consulting you first.
or even giving you fair warning.
wh-wh-what the hell are you talking about?
all right, you say you wanna know how I feel?
I'll tell you how I feel.
I think Cheryl's right.
I think maybe we shouldn't work together.
I think that it's become clear that there's conflicting, uh...
uh... priorities, and I think that there's conflicts of interest, and I think that that threatens to undermine the objectivity.
you know what I'm sayin'?
I think that's why negotiators don't, uh, command and that's why commanders don't negotiate.
because the stakes are too high.
there's just too many variables to take into account and I think...
let's get a room. Okay.
uh, hey, Lia. It's Emily.
put me through to Cheryl.
where?
Emily: I want on-site access to NCIC, PID, and I want everything Tactical has:
floorplans, blueprints, situation maps.
how many hostages?
okay, we're here Okay, this is it, guys.
officers! Hey!
my girlfriend's in there.
Hey!
crisis Negotiation Unit.
you wounded?
uh, it's paint. Do we have orders?
my orders are to isolate and contain the threat, which we currently understand to be a singular wack job armed with an explosive device.
can you describe him?
Yeah, he's Caucasian, 20's, blond hair, blue eyes, but he's wearing one of those Islamic beanies.
he opened up his coat to show that he had a full rig on underneath.
hand-held detonator, wired.
all right, let's evac the surrounding businesses.
get those squad cars out of here.
where do you two want to set up shop?
art gallery looks cozy.
good visibility. Let's go.
all right.
whose phone is this?
let me rephrase that.
who wants to die right now?
I said, Phones off.
clear! Clear!
cell phone's not an option.
we need to secure an in-store line.
and the cellular signals could trigger a detonator.
Oh, that reminds me: We need to get our hands on those 911 calls before they were cut off.
Lia, we on?
we're up.
recording now.
okay. We're hooked into RSIMS.
uh, we're up and running.
the HT hasn't made contact.
neither have the first responders.
we're gonna have to make the first call.
take the temperature.
am I gonna have a problem with you two?
no. No.
who's primary?
me. I am.
he's Islamic fundamentalist.
he's not gonna negotiate with a woman.
Yeah, exactly why I should make the first call.
get him to refuse me and force a stall.
I try to find someone else.
I can't win when she gets all smart like that.
make the call.
hello.
Hello, this is Emily Lehman with the Los Angeles Police.
who am I speaking with?
my name is Ali Sayid bin Hassan.
but the Western world will still know me as Trent Cunningham.
okay, Mr. Hassan.
uh, everything's under control out here.
is everything all right in there?
Yes, thank you, I have control.
now, if anyone tries to come in here, I will detonate explosives, which will kill everyone.
Hey, I understand. No one's gonna come in.
uh, I just wanna know if...
I don't care what you want.
I want camera crews every major network to be outside of these doors in 15 minutes.
I have a message to deliver.
and it is for the world to hear.
I understand. I would like to hear your...
15 minutes!
or I martyr everyone.
Lia, you get that?
running both names now.
Thermoscans confirm: One threat, 14 hostages.
we could take him out with selective fire right now.
but he could still trigger the vest, kill everyone inside. Great.
I'm working a scenario for a rear breach-- it may yield better results.
you mean better than everyone dead?
Yeah.
tell me something good.
well, you settle for weird?
Emily: Traditionally, suicide bombers don't make demands and terrorist hostage takers never work alone, so something doesn't add up.
Bureau's sending over some guy from Counter Terror, so he's gonna add it up for us. Are we negotiable?
yes or no?
well, we're pretty sure Ali intends to blow the place up on live TV.
it makes for slightly more dramatic footage than a crater.
better value.
so no cameras.
no, it's the only angle he's given us.
uh, we can attempt to delay satisfaction for his demand and maybe propose an exchange for hostages.
I can, uh, try and feel him out on the second call.
set up a briefing area for the media.
we're going to need them to play ball.
it's Mathers.
can you put her on the thing?
go ahead, Lia.
ali Sayid bin Hassan didn't raise any flags on any of our terrorist or criminal databases.
for Trent Cunningham, I've got a basic 411.
20 years old, student at UCLA, no priors, no warning bells, nothing.
he have a home address?
455 Dominion Avenue #220.
that's, like, five minutes from here.
he could've walked.
Oh...
holy...
care to elaborate, Mathers?
sorry, ma'am.
it's just... Trent Cunningham is not the listed owner of that condo at that address.
who is?
as in Congressman Carl Cunningham?
here he is.
wife Judith and son Trent.
what?
shut up!
brother, I'm on your side.
I know what you're doing you think is right for Islam.
think you can talk your way out of here, you're wrong.
you chose your side!
laptop.
that's a tracking number for an envelope our HT overnighted to his parents yesterday. Guess what I want?
you want it in your hands right now.
or sooner.
I'm on it.
all right, no one speaks without my permission.
if you talk, I promise that you will never leave here alive.
what?
Mr. Hassan, it's Emily.
what is it?
everything's okay.
uh, the media are on their way.
I-I just want to be prepared for the next step.
let's talk about how you and I can, um, get your message out in the best and safest way possible.
just get the cameras here, bitch!
okay, you sound upset.
that-that's not my intention.
okay, my intention is to help you get your message out.
if you let the people inside with you walk out, it will demonstrate to the world your mercy and your strength.
no one will doubt my strength.
and you cannot negotiate for my hostages.
I speak for God.
and God does not negotiate with infidels.
six minutes. Uh...
I heard everything.
called me a bitch and an infidel.
sweet sound of progress.
hmm.
I don't know.
what? He's talking. Yeah.
are we listening?
something bothering you?
Hey, go with your gut.
how long till his deadline?
five minutes.
terrorist expert's here to brief us.
okay. I'll see you over there.
al-qaeda loves to recruit converts.
gives them great raw material to mold.
you're dealing with individuals who feel devalued, despised, worthless.
by becoming terrorists, they're suddenly transformed into heroes.
and they are impossible to negotiate with.
one minute to deadline.
Matt: That's his deadline. It's not ours.
he'll wait for the cameras.
we found specs for the vest on his laptop.
it's lethal, but it's homemade.
ball bearings for shrapnel, 30-foot kill radius.
detonator's a nine-volt battery wired to a clothespin. There's a better than good chance we could take him out before he triggers it, but it has to be done up close.
or... we could talk him to death.
okay. I'm going to ask for a hard number here.
given this profile, how many hostages can you secure through negotiation? Realistic.
I'd say right now, we're probably lucky to come...
all.
the only person Trent Cunningham came here to kill today is himself.
we need to alter our strategy.
30 seconds. Is she suggesting concessions?
no, we take the tactical... That's against policy.
we do not engage in bargaining with terrorists...
quiet!
Matt, you're primary.
make the call. Tell him cameras are here.
l-let me explain.
Matt, make the call. Ten seconds.
the guy's talking, Cheryl.
we switch negotiators now and we risk losing that.
your plan was to switch negotiators.
but Trent hasn't followed the plan.
in fact, he has moved consistently against pattern for hostage siege.
so your profile does not apply.
then what profile does apply?
ritual public suicide is used to inflict emotional harm on another person.
the goal of suicide terrorism is psychological damage on an entire population.
what seems political is personal. Daddy.
anyone else find it coincidental that Carl Cunningham is in town campaigning for a senate seat at the same time his son walks into a neighborhood coffee shop dressed as America's greatest fear?
look at the evidence. His Muslim name, the extremist propaganda you found at his condo.
okay, but what's more interesting now is how I found it-- just sitting out on the coffee table.
like it wanted to be found, just like Trent wanted us to know his real name right from the top.
so this kid's going to blow up Coffee Nation 'cause he's pissed at Dad?
people have done worse.
it's probably up there, though.
let's say you're not wrong.
what do you want to do about it?
hello.
Hey, it's Emily.
uh, I just wanted to let you know that the camera crews have arrived and they're unloading their equipment in a ready area.
good. Good.
your parents are on their way here.
my parents?
I don't want to talk to them.
Yeah, I understand.
I'll call you when the cameras are ready.
successful reaction to the name.
did you hear the excitement in his voice when I brought up his parents?
Yeah.
thanks for, uh...
back there.
that wasn't about us.
I backed you up 'cause I thought you were right.
don't get used to it.
wouldn't want it any other way.
here are all the tracking numbers and package data for that shipment, as you requested.
but like I said, it's already left our distribution center.
so it's on the truck?
it's on the truck.
stop the truck.
stop the truck?
FBI, huh?
sweet.
here we go.
0-6-2-7-5. Open it.
looks like some sort of photo collage.
old family pictures. Okay, what I need you to do is take a digital still and send it to me.
uh, with what?
I don't have a camera.
there should be a package nearby.
tracking number.
inside is a digital picture phone.
take the photo and e-mail it direct to me.
OK, but it's factory direct, they won't have a...
read me the serial number. I'll get you service.
set up slow.
take your time plugging in your cables, assembling your tripods.
do not indicate that you are ready to shoot unless you are instructed by Commander Rogers.
is that clear?
that's Congressman Cunningham.
there's his wife with him?
great.
here we go.
I just wanted to let you know that the news vans are on their way up to the shop now.
Trent, I need to ask you a question.
are you going to commit suicide?
no, I just strapped a bomb on my chest because I had nothing else to wear.
look, everything's going to be all right, okay, baby?
is that because you want to die, or is it because of some other reason, like you, um, you want to get even with somebody?
you recording this call?
Yeah.
I want to die because that is Allah's will.
islamic what?
he got the recipe for the bomb from an Islamic chat site.
though we don't believe him to be working under the direction of any known fundamentalist group.
Mr. Cunningham...
this is our fault. No.
we need to speak with Trent.
we need to speak with our son.
that's not a good idea.
Trent is speaking with one of our negotiators right now.
if we introduce a third party
we're not a third party. We're his family.
see those people behind the barricades?
those are the families of your son's hostages.
I'm sure they'd like the same opportunity.
okay, you realize what this will do to your parents, don't you?
I mean, besides losing you, your father will lose his career.
he'll never recover from this.
well, Allah works in mysterious ways, doesn't he?
Yeah, this isn't about God, is it?
this is about you.
what did he do to you?
God?
your father.
Hey!
Hey, is that a phone?
talking to the police?
my boyfriend! Someone inside's on a phone.
Trent, pick up the phone!
hey... hey.
Trent, pick up the phone!
time to die.
come on, man, pick up the phone!
do not come in!
don't come in.
I promise you, no one is coming in.
I said do not come in.
get back. Stay back.
okay, you're okay. We're okay.
all right, you don't have to say anything.
Yeah, just keep breathing with me.
stay with me. Don't put the phone down.
all right.
we're gonna get her out of there, all right?
but that's not your job; that's ours.
that's my job.
all right?
this just came in from Mathers.
negotiators had their chance.
we need to move now or this is gonna end bad.
Emily: Trent, all I need you to do is stay with me.
okay, you're doing great.
I just need you to stay with me.
hold on.
check it out.
what? Wh-what is it?
what, is this about Mom?
I think he intended for her to see this after it was all over.
looks cut and pasted.
they're not in any of the actual pictures together.
the root of every crisis is a broken relationship, right?
Oh, hang on.
yeah?
we were close.
now it's their show.
no, we're not done yet.
Trent, I need you to listen to me, all right?
this is very important.
I understand why you don't want to talk over the phone.
I have a suggestion for how we can fix that.
okay, my suggestion is that I come to you unarmed and we sit down and talk.
no phones, just you and me.
hrt, hold.
what is she doing?
okay, I am willing to do this for you if you let the hostages go.
all you need is one hostage and you are still in control.
I'll make for a good trade.
if this is a trick, you die, too.
no, call him back. Uh-uh, you're not going in there.
Why? I just made a deal with the hostage taker. You want me to break it?
we have an order for tactical action.
Y-Y-Y-You're going against that, and you're putting yourself at risk.
you're acting like me.
you said go with my gut.
no, Emily.
HRT's going in.
is this about them or is this about us?
you walk in there and there is no us.
don't make a sound.
they're coming out.
we are live in Brentwood, where a terrorist hostage crisis is underway.
you know, I was planning on doing that anyway.
I know.
you just know everything, don't you?
I know you came here to kill yourself today, not anybody else.
you know you're gonna die with me?
we don't need help. What we need is action.
I need a press release. We don't need Carolyn right now.
I am just trying to...
I know exactly what you're trying to do.
Hi.
could you excuse us?
no, not really.
you recognize this?
where did you get that?
in a letter addressed to you from Trent.
you have any idea why he'd send this to you?
no. No? Well, I think I do.
I think he's trying to send you a message. What message?
loosely translated, uh, "Mom, this is your fault.
excuse me?
I wasn't talking to you.
who the hell do you think you are?
you want your son to live?
what kind of question is that?
it's the simple yes or no kind. Do you want your son to live?
I am not going to stand here...
do you want your son to live?!
Yes.
okay, tell me why he hates you.
you just lost your job.
I know this is about your mother, Trent. Everybody knows.
so you spoke to Judith?
what did she do to you?
what did she do? She didn't do anything. I did.
what did you do?
I don't know!
I was the valedictorian of our class.
I got straight A's.
I played on the soccer team.
I mean, maybe she just didn't like my face.
Emily: Yeah, I saw a campaign photo of your family.
you looked happy in it.
No! You saw what Judith wanted you to see.
she always wanted everyone to see how happy we were because she thought it would help Dad get elected.
hugs at rallies, kisses at fundraisers.
I remember when I was a kid...
man, I would get so happy... when we had to take a photo because it meant she had to be nice to me.
he could've killed those people.
get away from me.
but he didn't.
we're trying to save him, Judith.
but he doesn't care what we want.
did you ever confront her about this?
I considered other options, you know?
knocking on her door and lighting myself on fire when she answered it.
even bought this kerosene.
but, you know, I scrapped that idea when I realized she probably wouldn't care.
you know what?
she'd probably find some way to spin it.
establish the Trent Foundation for Suicidally Depressed Teens.
pick up a couple sympathy votes, right?
so you decided to destroy the one thing she did care about?
just in time for election.
pretty crazy, huh?
Yeah, I don't like that word.
well, what would you call it?
what would you call it?
huh?
what word would you use?
come on.
you know you want to. Now, what would you call it?
I would say you're a highly intelligent, severely bipolar borderline personality with an unresolved Oedipal conflict, which is not your fault.
well, I am my mother's son.
my partner's inside that coffee shop with your son.
he has an explosive vest strapped to his chest.
you want me to tell him this?
it's what he needs to hear.
you know, I'm getting tired.
I am just getting tired of holding this thing apart.
you ever just feel like letting go? Trent...
what's that?
Trent, this is Matt Flannery with the FBI.
can you hear me?
I've got a message from your mother.
it's not long.
she'd like me to read it to you.
perfect.
she'll get in the last word.
I'm gonna read it verbatim.
get ready for a message of love and concern from the mother of the year.
I'm sorry.
I never wanted children.
she...
why would she...
I'm sorry.
why would she say that?
I can't believe she'd say that.
look, you did nothing wrong, Trent.
okay? She did.
this is your life, okay?
all right, you don't need to live it for her.
all right?
all right.
and you don't need to end it for her.
okay?
it's okay.
it's okay. It's okay.
okay.
I'm tired.
Yes!
Hey, hey, hey-ey-ey, get back there.
no, let me... That's my son.
what?
okay, this is a fair deal.
the board knows you're upset and they want to make it right.
yeah? Well, they should've thought about that before they fired me and gave miller my office.
like the view, miller?
you can have it back.
look, Howard, we're running out of time
my bosses have given me a two-hour window to close this deal and then I can't help you anymore.
you got one minute left.
I don't care about your deadlines.
he's going to shoot them all. Why don't you storm the room?
because your friend miller is tied to a chair that's blocking the only entry point.
there's got to be another way.
Mr. Winston, you have been a great help to us, and now I need you to stand down.
fine. But there's no way finch is going to go for the deal.
well, he's about to lose his chance.
Howard, this is your last chance. Please.
take the options.
Hey, honey...don't play contract hardball with me.
I practically invented the sport. Isn't that right, tom?
you're done. - No, wait!
no. Howie, time's up.
new deal: You come out or we're coming in.
what are you, bad cop? - No. I'm reality cop.
the reality, Howie, is in 60 seconds, we're...
Hey, Howard!
don't call me Howie. - Okay.
I am not a Howie.
can you agree to his cash demand?
I can agree to a unicorn and it'll mean just as much legally.
okay. What is the richest severance package your company's given out?
he's got to believe it's real.
okay, but after I get fired, you're buying drinks.
deal.
okay. You want to play chicken...
we can play icken.
I ain't playing with you.
I'm just trying to get you out of there alive.
Hey, the only way I'm walking out of here is rich.
there's a phone ringing in there? I thought we shut the lines off.
Yeah, hello? - Howard, it's Emily. Listen.
they're offering you a cash payout at the current price of those stock options:
65 cents on the dollar. - What the hell's going on?
it's the same parachute that they offered albert higgs.
Alex winston is here, and he's ready to put it in writing.
Howard, don't listen to her. She's not authorized to make that deal.
lehman, get off the phone.
Hey, shut up! - Hey, Matt, just let me talk to him.
no, you had your chance and he had his.
Howie, listen to me. Don't listen to her. - We were almost there.
Emily can't stand to lose, and she lost this one. - Matt, stop it.
she can't handle it.
Matt, you're making it worse. - She has to be right all the...
shut up! - she's being stubborn about this because she's a stubborn, scared little girl.
quiet!
stay down! Everybody stay down!
he's down. Hostages secure.
nice screen pass, guys.
so that whole fight was just...
to keep him off balance till we could get tactical to go in for the breach.
Yeah. Excellent.
Thanks. - Excellent.
we're gonna need a detailed log. - Okay.
Mr. Winston?
yes? Can I get you to call your headquarters?
Yes. Yes, sure.
come on.
thank you. - Sure.
nice work.
stubborn, scared little girl?
well, I had to say something, and that's just what came out.
out of nowhere?
look.
this is as hard for me as it is for you, okay?
it's not hard for me well then I guess it's harder for me than it is for you.
usually when I break up with somebody I don't have to see them every single day.
I asked you on tuesday if you wanted to be reassigned.
Yeah, that was tuesday. That was, like, eight days ago.
I don't know what the rules are here anymore.
there are no rules.
am I not supposed to check out your ass, or do I just not get to touch you?
Oh, you want to touch me. Is that the problem?
feel better? - Yeah, kind of.
it's been actually nine days.
lock the door. - Got it.
Hey. - Hey.
Where's Matt and Emily?
uh, debriefing on the bus.
thought I'd give them some time alone.
can't be fun.
God, that was really stupid.
stupid?
I don't know if stupid's the word I'd use.
stupid on, like, seven different levels.
Oh, well, I'm glad you're being honest about it.
well, I don't mean that it wasn'T...
personally I'm glad we got it out of the way.
what do you mean, got it out of the way?
you know, I've had break-ups where you have break-up sex, and break-ups where you don'T.
without, it's no good. There's always bad blood.
you and I have to work together.
well, then I'm glad we got it out of the way.
Yeah. I'm glad we did.
Yeah.
So...the director called.
apparently he has some friends on the suhietech board, who were thrilled, to say the least, of your handling of Howard finch.
and I made sure to mention your names in particular.
don't be surprised if a commendation from D. C.Lands on your desk.
great. - Thank you.
So...you wanted to talk to me.
we're splitting up. - We need to be reassigned.
okay.
I knew you were going through a rough patch.
you knew? - Honey, narcotics knew.
Cheryl, you know, the thing is is that you were right, the relationship it's impacting the job.
Yeah, we just can't be together anymore on or off duty, so...
I understand.
it's going to take some time to figure out reassignments and, well, I'm assuming that you'll...want your desks to move.
it's none of my business, um...what went wrong?
you guys were doing so well, and...
you know... - it's complicated.
you win some, you lose some.
or not.
what are you doing?
I think I'm going to, uh, work on this stuff in the cafeteria.
no, no, no. You don't have to do that.
I'll leave. I'll go. I don't want to screw up your system.
no. I think I want to get some air.
you feeling all right?
Yeah, lehman.
Winston. - Sorry?
uh, sorry, this is...alex winston from suhietech.
I was with you in...
Oh, yeah. Hi, I'm sorry.
what can I do for you?
well, turns out I haven't been fired, uh...
even though I did reveal the filthiest secrets of our business affairs department to you.
but I was wondering if you're still up for that drink?
Oh, um...
you don't really have to buy. That was just, uh...
unless you want to, in which case, you know, I won't let you.
the thing is, um...
it's kind of not a good time...for me.
what, you're booked friday three weeks from now?
cause that's the only time I can schedule you in.
uh, no, you know what?
it's just not a good...time.
listen, uh, if it ever becomes a good time, or if you can think of anything else I can do to thank you for the amazing job you did, just hit me back at this number, it's my cell phone.
okay. Will do. Take care.
who was that?
um, that was alex winston from suhietech.
Oh. Yeah. - You know, the one who...
Yeah. - Yeah.
welcome to mi casa.
come on.
Oh, my god! How many rooms is in here?
well, they say five bedrooms.
but you know, there's more rooms than that.
how'd you know to do that?
I keep telling you. I was here for your birthday, remember?
the hot tub?
okay, come on now. Get down from there. That's glass.
I know. I like it.
come on, I want to give you girls a tour. Don't you wanna see the bedroom?
don't worry. We will.
Yeah, after I smash your face in.
what the hell are you doing home?
what am I doing home? What am i doing home?
what are you doing with two ho's in my house?
who you calling a ho?
you, white girl.
get your topanga wannabe ass out of my face.
what?
Ariel, stop!
Reggie, get off of me!
get off of me! Don't touch me!
chill!
Tina, what the hell's going on...
Mike, what are you doing here?
is that your car down the st...
no.
it's not what you think. All right?
are you kidding me?
Reggie. - This guy?
this guy?
Reggie! - Wait, wait. In my house?
don't touch me!
so, wait, he asked you for your number?
who?
Oh, uh, n-no. He had my number.
he just asked me for drinks. - No, I mean yesterday, on the, on the bus.
no, I don't know.
I mean, I guess he got it from the directory.
Yeah.
what's the matter, he's not your type?
what?
well, he seemed like a nice enough guy. You know.
the fortune 500 type.
power tie. Power teeth.
what are you saying? You want me to go out...
no, I'm not saying anything.
you go out with whoever you want to go out with.
that's part of being single.
is that what you're doing?
me? - Yeah.
have you been with someone else already?
I mean, this week?
I don't know, who's asking?
answer the question.
that's not the right question. It's not me seeing someone else.
it's just me seeing someone.
so, you are?
no, but I could be. I mean, I will be eventually.
you will be eventually, too. I hope.
right. - I mean, I don't want to see you die alone.
Hey, alex. It's, uh, Emily, uh...
Yeah. Sorry.
let's do it. Drinks.
um, and, uh, you buy.
today is good.
um, I don't know, wherever you, uh...
Oh, well, there's this place near the federal building.
it's, uh, sloan'S. You know it?
uh, yeah, that'll work.
um, okay. Cool. I'll see you there.
happy? - Are you kidding me?
sloan'S. You're gonna go to sloan'S.
why, who's asking?
no, nobody. Say hi to everyone.
who the hell are you to lecture me?
you got some ska on my table!
they were nobody, this is my best friend.
get off of me.
hold on, all right?
kick his ass, reggie!
Mike, don't hurt him!
Aw, man. Man!
Reggie, I didn't want to...sorry.

Reggie, put that down. - Shut up!

Hey, I'm going. - No, you ain'T.
I'm calling the cops. - Good!
tell 'em I caught an intruder.
Hey, where are you going? You ain't going to walk away from this.
what are you going to do, shoot me?

Hello, 9-1-1? My husband's acting like a little punk.

put your hands over your head and turn around, slow, now.
what the hell Do I look like to you?
like what I got, mike? You like what I got?
come on, reggie, man, you don't have to do this.
I don't hook you up with enough girls, you gotta take mine?
it ain't like that, all right? I never touched her.
Oh, yeah, you guys were just here goin' over work, right?
wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, were you in my office?
no. No.
were you in my business?
not in your business, reggie, okay.
please put the gun down.
Reggie markovich, this is the police. We're outside.
you need to come to the door with your hands up.
Hey, this guy's in my house!
he attacked me in my house.
and he ain't coming out 'til I know what I gotta know!
you liar! You hit him first.
let go of me! This is my house.
I'm gonna sue you, this ain't right!
call swat.
what? - Really?
it's a hostage situation, we got to radio...
dispatch...
did you have to use a credit card for this?
sex crimes has a P. O.For this.
you rang. - Yes.
Where's your partner?
never mind. Domestic barricade, woodland hills.
one hostage. - Okay.
page me?
uh, domestic barricade, woodland hills. One hostage.
domestic? How come we have it.
guy who started crunk girlz.
softcore internet site, dvd business.
it's girls gone wild, the street version.
crunk is the dance style?
no, that's krumping.
crunk is crazy drunk.
how do you know that?
Yeah. To answer your original questions, sex crimes has asked us to handle this as a favor to them.
they are working on a case against markovich for exploiting minors in his videos.
LAPD has agreed to let us step in.
well, that's kind of them. All right, I'll take it.
wait, you're gonna take it?
Yeah, well, you started primary on the last one and, uh, you got that drinks thing a little bit later on.
why don't you pair me up with binder?
binder has a partner.
I will give you mcallister as secondary. If that's all right with you.
Yeah, great. Shoot me the address.
who do you have drinks with?
he is out of his mind.
he thinks everyone is out to get him. He thinks I'm out to get him.
Tina...I want you to walk me through what happened.
I already told you. He came home and...
who came home?
Reggie was supposed to be down in long beach getting ready for a photo shoot today.
instead, he walks into my house with two skanks.
we had words and he pulls a gun on my friend. - All right, stop.
who's your friend? - Mike!
Mike delgado, he works at crunk, he's been on the camera crew since the beginning.
so, you and mike were in the house doing what?
he's my friend. We were talking.
Uh-huh. - What's uh-huh?
you don't believe me? are you on his side now?
McAllister, you got any questions?
how do you spell delgado?
top room, on the right. He's got his security system watching us.
is this the list? - Where's lehman?
uh, roy mcallister, this is frank rogers.
Tina, your husband has quite a few guns registered to his name.
we need to know which one he's using.
the colt, in the living room. That one.
he have any guns in the house not on that list?
say hello to my little friend. Recognize this?
it's the gun from scarface.
m-16 with the 40-millimeter grenade launcher.
guess how much it cost me?
Reggie, you don't need that thing, all right?
Oh, you wanna try runnin' now? See how far you make it.
ain't nobody comin' in here for you.
this room is like a fortress.
but I guess it's not strong enough, huh? How long?
Reggie, I didn'T... - how long?
don't come in! - Mr. Markovich?
I can see you. Don't come in, this is my house, you don't have a warrant.
now put my wife on the phone.
I don't think that's such a good idea, sir.
can I call you reggie? - Who is this?
this is Matt flannery with the fbi, and I gotta tell you, uh, we got more than enough probable cause to come in there without a warrant if we needed to.
we're fine out here for right now. How are you and mike doing?
FBI? Why's the fbi here?
I don't know.
she sold me out, didn't she? Tina's been settin' me up with these charges.
well, for starters you've got... - those girls signed waivers!
no, no, no, no, reggie, listen,
I don't have anything to do with any investigation into your business, that's not my department. I'm a hostage negotiator, you've taken a hostage.
what? Hostage?
this guy, who I thought was my friend, attacked me in my home.
I'm defending my home.
that's not how I heard it... - I don't care what she told you, she's lying.
did she tell you she was cheating...
she's not cheating on you. - Shut up!
street's closed, ma'am. You got to go around.
my son is there.
it's his house. Let me in.
Reggie, I understand what you're going through, okay?
probably a little bit better than you think.
women drive you nuts.
a woman claiming to be the H. T.'S mother is outside.
Yeah, check it out.
okay, this girl, she, she wasn't there for you, she hurt you and you're, you're trying to hurt her back. But you're just hurting yourself right now.
you can't do that.
you cannot let her put you off your game.
you got a good business going, you don't want to let her damage that.
that's what I'm trying to tell you, she is damaging my business.
she's been stealing from me, right out from under me, millions of dollars!
laughing at me! Laughing at me!
well, that's a pretty serious charge. You have proof of that?
I'm gonna get some right now.
No! No! Don'T. Please.
please.
okay, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, please, please.
how did you get here? Did reggie call you?
I live here!
you live here? - Yeah.
up the street, I live my house. You understand?
no, no, you didn'T. Not today. Get off my property.
where reggie is? Reggie!
get her out, please. I can't deal with her.
what did you do? - Oh, what did I do?
what did I do?
of course, every time reggie does something bad it's my fault?
you know this woman? this is really his mother?
this is the reason That my husband is so sick in the head.
I tell him, I tell him...nyet, nyet...
no go back to her. No go back to her!
he bought her a $1. 7 million house up the street.
I tell him don't trust her, don't trust her.
what did you say?
I say, you just want his money.
you get out of my life! - Prostitutka!
Oh, no you didn't! - Okay, okay.
I'm gonna kill you. I swear to god, kill you.
you know what? You know what?
let someone escort her home.
I used to reject that whole concept, that your whole life could change in a day.
that was for the movies, you know, but after yesterday, watching Howard up there, I...I could actually feel it happening.
well, I mean, that rage had been building up inside of him for a lot longer than that one d.
no, I'm talking about me.
Finch was sort of a role model for me, comin' up.
so, seeing him lose it like that it made me think of my priorities
and then I, I run into someone like you, and it's a whole other thing, you're about something.
well, I don't know... - you make a difference.
and you're sexy and you carry a gun.
Yeah. - No, but your job means something.
you save lives.
my job, Howard's job, it doesn't mean anything.
so, I mean, what are you gonna do?
quit your job? - Well, that's the thing.
it's not so easy, right?
I mean, it's like breaking up with somebody.
it's part of your identity, there's a history there.
there are things that annoy you, but there's also a lot of good stuff.
so you take all that into consideration and say, okay, am I just freaked out or has this been coming for months?
it's like you said.
your whole life can change in a day, right?
look at me. look at me.
I'm gonna ask you a question, and I want you to tell me the truth.
were you stealing from your husband?
what?
no. I don't have time for what?
I have time for yes, and how much?
are you stealing from him? - No!
do you have access to the corporate accounts?
I run the corporate accounts. I run the whole damn business.
I am a licensed cpa. Reggie didn't even pass algebra.
I'm the only one he trusts with the money.
okay, so you... - wait a second.
did he say that?
did he say I stole from the accounts?
I think he's a little emotional right now...
Hey, hey, hey, where you going? - Get out of my way.
I will kick his ass. - Come here.
look, get off of me! Get off of me!
I can't take this!
you were my brother, mike.
like the brother I never had. - I know.
how could you do this to me?
I'm trying to tell you that we were just talking, reggie.
Yeah, you got a lot in common, huh?
Reg, I never slept with your... - why should I believe you?
cause it's the truth, man. - Why should I believe you?
cause I'm in love with her, reggie.
I have been ever since we were little kids in school, all right?
she don't love me, bro. She loves you.
that's what we talk about.
you. You're what we have in common.
see, she treats me like a brother, and then you go, and you treat her like dirt, man.
Oh, don't even try to bring up girls,'cause you know she cheated on me.
it's nobody's fault, man.
you're just not the right guy for her.
Oh, and you are?
Reg, me and tina-- we grew up in the same barrio.
our families like each other. - Where do you think I'm from, the palisades?
doesn't matter, reg. - I grew up south of olympic.
it doesn't matter, reggie. You're just different.
she was raised catholic, but you're jewish, man.
I'm russian!
my moms came over here with no money.
she worked as a dishwasher, bro, a lavaplatos. We had no money.
I made all this myself! We street jews, son!
the police won't let me talk to him.
his phone don't ring.
I feel like having stroke.
my heart is breaking.
I'll call you back.
Oh, man! What now?
Hey, reggie. I talked to your wife.
she's saying she didn't steal any money from you, and I kind of believe her.
look, I'm kind of busy right now.
we're getting to some truth here. Let me call you back.
no, no, no, no, no. Don't hang up.
there's another phone ringing in there. I thought we shut down the lines.
someone's making a call on one of the flagged numbers.
Tina's cell. - Lia, can you intercept that call?
you let mike go, or I swear I'll start cutting on your mother.
what?
you want to play hard? I can play hard, too, baby.
it's funny?
and your boss heard him say that?
Yeah. I mean, everybody heard.
the tactical unit, the support unit...
see, this is why the office thing doesn't work.
cause everybody knows your business. - Completely.
I mean, it is gonna be such a relief to not have to keep up that juggling act week after week while I'm basically trying to put out fires.
I mean, it's just too damn hard.
I knew this guy, this, uh, friend of mine...
I'm sorry. Hold that thought.
Hello?
how many drinks have you had?
uh, one. A glass of wine.
It'S...well, it's like a spritzer. I'm at sloan'S. What's up?
we have a hostage situation. Woodland hills.
what, you need me to relie Matt?
no. Different incident.
actually a chain reaction thing.
I'm headed over there now.
uh, you sure you're fine? - Yeah.
all right, I'll come get you. Three minutes. Be outside.
okay.
Tina, I swear to god...
she told you I stole money from you, and you believed her?
this ain't cool.
what, you believe anything that she tells you?
you let her go! - You let mike go!
and you surrender to the cops, or I swear to god, you'll be sorry.
you touch her, I'll blow his head off!
you blow his head off, I'll cut her head off, and don't think i won'T...
Hello? - Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
Hello! - It's Matt.
everything is all right. Just calm down.
no it's not. She just...
no, no, no, no. We know what's happening.
we got officers over at your mom's house right now.
they're containing the scene. Your mom is gonna be okay.
Hello? Hello!
she says she's gonna kill her. She just hung up.
no, no, no, no, no. We did that, okay?
we jammed the cell signal from outside.
what are you laughing at? You ain't going nowhere.
put tina back on.
absolutely not. The both of you need to calm down right now.
I'm not gonna calm down until she calms down.
you tell her that! - I will.
you tell her, or I'll kill mike right now!
Yeah, reggie, she knows that already, okay?
that's why she's not gonna do anything til I get back to her.
now, you got to trust me here, man. I'm on your side.
I just spoke with your mother.
she's a very sweet lady, and I'm gonna keep her safe, all right?
you just sit tight till I get back to you. Don't do anything stup...
just don't do anything.
if I don't hear back from you in, like, five minutes...
I'll call you back in five minutes.
Hey. - Hey.
Where's the scene?
one's down there. The other one's up the street.
sorry about all this.
Why?
all right, I'm not sorry.
who the hell are these people?
you ever seen the jerry springer show?
take a couple guests, stick 'em in a mansion and give 'em machine guns.
both houses are secured.
duff says the wife is armed with a kitchen knife.
she knows she's surrounded, wants to talk to the husband.
well, we can't let that happen. She's a real handful.
you know? Insane.
Yeah, lia debriefed me on the way over.
sounds like reggie's the real threat here.
uh, I don't know what lia told you, but I was actually getting somewhere with reggie before the wife decided to take the law into her own hands.
it was an impulsive move, but reggie's the one with prior assault charges.
Emily, she's got a knife to the mother-in-law's throat.
I think you're right. I think we should keep them apart.
Emily, try to make contact with tina.
Matt, why don't you...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll call her back. - Right.
okay. Sorry.
these rusty teapots are disgusting.
I always meant to tell you that.
you do not want to be hanging up on me, okay?
he didn't, tina. I did.
who the hell is this?
my name's Emily. I'm with the fbi.
I think you met some of my friends outside.
I want to talk to reggie.
I want him to tell me to my face that I stole money from him.
well, you want to talk to reggie, you're gonna have to talk to me first.
she is talking to us, reggie.
what is she talking about? Did you give her my message?
she knows it.
and what, she don't take me serious?
no, no, no, no. We all take you serious...ly.
cause I will unload on this boy!
Reggie, I did not tell her to do this, man.
all right? - Shut up!
Tina, I know you're doing this to save mike, but you're putting him in more danger by threatening sofia.
no. Reggie has to know how it feels.
how what feels?
how it feels to hurt someone. Really hurt someone.
trust me. He's feeling it.
no, he's not. He's a selfish pig who only cares about himself.
okay, you know what? Let's say that's true.
but that's not mike's fault, and that's not sofia's fault.
are you blind?
it's all her fault! It's all her fault.
she makes it like...
like he's some prince that everyone should worship, and then she tells him that he's no good to her, that he's killing her, that he's making her sick.
well, you know what? You make me me sick.
all right, tina...
you never liked me.
no matter how good I was to him.
what did I ever do to you? You tell me.
you cheated! You break reggie's heart.
I will never forgive that.
that was ten years ago. I was 16 years old! - All right, tina...
he cry for three weeks.
I'm sure we can...
all right, she needs something from him.
what? He's working. Talk through me.
I need something.
I can't get mike without the mom.
something. An olive branch, something, anything.
all right, all right, get out.
Reggie? - What?
okay, listen.
you ever hear a phrase, mutually assured destruction?
what?
it goes like this.
the soviets got all their nukes pointed at us, and we got all our nukes pointed at them, all right?
now, if eith side fires one nuke, they all launch, and it's armageddon.
Soviets are gone now.
right, but you-you get what I'm saying, right?
Yeah. I've seen armageddon. So what?
okay, um...
well, that's the situation here, okay?
you and tina both got these nukes pointed at each other, and everybody's afraid to stand down.
I'm not afraid of her.
exactly, which is how you're gonna get around this, because you're the smart one, okay?
now, what they would do in the cold war, was one side would give the other side a gift as a kind of way to save face.
you know, it's like saying, hey, I'm not afraid to nuke your ass if I have to, but I don't necessarily want to have to, and-and here's a panda bear.
you follow me?
what is your point?
my point is, the cold war ended, right?
and these gifts were an important part of it.
now, if you go first, that shows you're the bigger person and the smarter person.
I don't care!
she can have whatever she wants.
okay, I'll find out what that is. - That doesn't matter, tina.
the truth is, she never thought I was good enough for reggie because no one was good enough for her little bubula.
Tina, stop it. You don't need her to like you.
I know that.
all right, well then start acting like it.
leave the past behind you, and start thinking abouyour future.
what do you mean? - I mean-- you and reggie are over.
it's over.
okay, you don't need to stress about him anymore, or sofia.
you don't need to worry about anymore whether...whether or not he cares about you.
you need to move on. You're...free.
he said that?
Reggie, he said it was...he said it was over?
he said he's willing to give you whatever you want.
like what, the house?
well, something along those...
cause he can keep the damn house, I never liked it anyway.
too big. Fine.
you tell him I want the hummer.
the hummer. - The hummer.
Reggie, she wants the hummer.
fine. - Fine.
fine. - He says, fine.
okay, and I want the white antique armoire.
the white antique armoire? - The armoire.
uh, she's also asking for the armoire.
the white one. - The white one.
whatever.
Yeah.
it's yours.
and the baby grand. - Baby grand.
uh, how do you feel about giving her the piano?
I think it'd be a very good idea. - Fine.
and I want 50% of crunk profits going forward, including fashion line and merchandising.
shut up.
what's going on in there? - Nothing.
sounds like she's having some trouble.
she's just being herself.
my...my chest.
sounds like she's going into cardiac arrest.
duff, do you have a visual into the house?
copy that. H.T. Is still in striking distance of the hostage.
you might be right about that heart attack.
she doesn't look too good.
guys, what the hell's going on in there?
we might have to go in.
all right. Tina, please, if she needs medical attention you need to let us inside.
she's faking it.
she knows I deserve 50% of the business. I helped build it.
I was even the first model...
it's hurting me.
Tina! We can hear her.
all right, she wants 50% of the profits from the business.
duff, stand by.
she wants 50% of all the profits from here on out.
she can have 75! - 75?
75%. Now stand down and let us inside.
no, I want 50%. That's it.
you tell him. I just want 50%
she wants 50. - Look, all she wants is 50%. That's all.
what do you mean, that's it?
I mean that's it. That's fair. It's enough.
she doesn't want anything else?
what else is there? - What about her dolls?
tell her she forgot her stupid dolls.
she forgot her dolls?
does she want the dolls?
do you want the dolls?
no.
no, she doesn't want the dolls. Do we have a deal?
she doesn't?
no, no, no...
neither do I.
what the hell was that? Sounded like a giant car crash.
help!
secure cover and dig in!
Tina. - Reggie, are you there?
he's not answering.
neither is she.
that was an m-203. I'm sure of it.
so, now we know it works, and that he's got at least one grenade.
Duff's confirming the second site. H.T. And hostage are still in play.
the heart attack is getting worse.
pull your inner perimeter back, just in case he has another grenade.
I'm gonna have bravo take out the wife.
wait a second here.
okay, I know things are getting out of control...
no, it's been out of control.
that's 'cause we've been going about this all wrong.
we've been trying to split 'em up easy.
we should be putting these guys back together again.
what?
they're crazy about each other.
nobody goes to this much trouble unless you really care for somebody.
I mean, the guy just blew up a roomful of dolls.
I-I don't understand why, but this...
this is pain. This is a guy in lE.
that grenade cost me 200 bucks.
just blew up $200, 000 worth of collector dolls.
she dug 'em.
bought her one every birthday. Valentine's day. Christmas. Hanukkah.
sometimes just on thursday.
she loved those dolls.
what did you ever do for her?
like I said, man...
all we ever did was talk.
help!
will you stop it already? - Help!
or I will really give you something to scream about.
you are gonna get out of this just fine.
I'm the one who's going to jail.
but I'm still gonna take 50% of the company I helped start.
there's nothing you can do about that...mom.
so you wanna get these two on the phone-- together?
Yeah. - At the same time?
we'll be on to referee.
all four of you will be on the phone?
Yeah. You in on this?
it was a preemptive strike. - Exactly.
command, this is duff. I got an update.
she asked for the hummer. - his car.
and she knew When he let it go, he was letting her go and letting...them go.
and he said yes, because you dump her before she dumps you.
I agree with matt.
all right. The only reason why I'm giving you a shot is because the mother- in-law was faking her heart attack.
anything goes wrong, I'm having tactical end this-- on both sides.
okay.
you want me out of the way, mike?
I'll get out of the way. I'll get out...
no, reggie. Reggie, don'T. Don't do that.
what now?
Reggie, are you okay?
no. - Yeah, I didn't think so. Listen.
I'm gonna put you on the line with your wife.
but if you yell at each other, we will cut you off.
you asked to talk to one another. Now's your chance.
she said what she wanted... - Wait. I don't wanna talk to him.
okay, you know what?
we're gonna take this slow, and we're gonna take turns.
Tina. - I don't got nothing to say.
that'll be a first.
Reggie, wait your turn.
Oh, don't bother. He won't listen.
Oh, look who's talking.
okay. Hold on.
only person he listens to is his mom.
you leave her out of this! - You wanna talk to her?
you wanna talk to her? She's right here?
mute 'em.
no, wait. - This is going south.
Bravo, go in for a takedown.
moving.
both of you shut up!
listen to me.
Reggie, back when you said that you weren't afraid of tina that's crap.
you were scared to death of her.
and that's a good thing because that means that you love her, so congratulations.
what?
and she loves you so much that it scares her to think of her life without you.
what?
that's why you guys try to hurt each other.
you've been together for a long time.
and you're starting to come apart and it freaks you out.
Reggie, that's why you blew up those dolls.
that's a perfectly normal thing to do.
you blew up my dolls?
you took my mother hostage!
because she knew it would hurt you.
just like you hurt her when you accused her of stealing from you.
which you only did because you were scared she was leaving you.
right.'cause you were sleeping with mike.
she wasn't sleeping with him! - I never slept with him!
but I thought you were. - I know.
I wanted you to think that because you were with those girls.
you know why?
cause of this.
because of all this-- this house, this life, this, this, this business...
when we hit big, it was just...
just what?
it was all because of you.
I mean, I had the vision, but how stupid was that?
it wasn't even original.
you were the one that made the thing go.
and when it took off it was just, I thought...I don't know...
you didn't need me anymore.
why would you think something stupid like that?
cause I'm stupid. You're the smart one.
Oh, baby.
stand by.
here he comes. Hold your fire.
let's get that ambulance around here.
Hi. You okay?
you shot me!
Yes, I did.
Yeah. Good. Bring her around.
what the hell was that? - What?
using tactical, I mean, that was totally uncalled for.
it was totally unnecessary. - We're five seconds away from I give up.
you used us to do what, to set up targets?
what are we even doing here? - Why do we even try?
why are we even here?
what's so funny? - What's so funny?
uh, no, no reason.
um, you're absolutely right. Both of you.
debriefing, 8:00 A. M.Tomorrow. Get some rest.
well, I guess you were right. - About what?
they really do love each other.
Yeah, well...doesn't necessarily mean they belong together.
no, doesn'T.
although, I'll say this...
he gets out of the hospital, they both make bail, they're looking at some serious make-up sex.
yeah? - Yeah.
is that as good as break-up sex?
well, they say it's better.
Really? - That's what they say.
don't grieve, Admiral.
it is logical.
the needs of the many outweigh......the needs of the few or the one.
I have been and always shall be your friend.
live long and prosper.
we are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead.
this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world.
a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect.
he did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one.
of my friend, I can only say this:
of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most......human.
honours. Hup!
space, the final frontier.
these are the continuing voyages of the Starship Enterprise.
her ongoing mission to explore strange new worlds.
to seek out new lifeforms and new civilisations.
to boldly go......where no man has gone before.
USS Enterprise, Captain's Personal Log.
with most of our battle damage repaired, we're almost home.
yet I feel uneasy. And I wonder why.
perhaps it is the emptiness of this vessel.
most of our trainee crew has been reassigned.
lieutenant Saavik and my son David are exploring the Genesis planet, which he helped create.
and Enterprise feels like a house with all the children gone.
no, more empty even than that.
the death of Spock is like an open wound.
it seems that I've left the noblest part of myself back there......on that newborn planet.
status, Mr Sulu. - On course, Admiral.
estimating space dock in 2. 1 hours.
very well. Mr Chekov, I'll need a pre-approach scan.
take the science station, please. - Yes, sir.
Uhura... Any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis enquiries?
no, sir, there is no response. - That's very odd.
Scotty, progress report. - It's almost done, sir.
you'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
excellent timing. You fixed the barn door after the horse has come home.
how much refit time till we can take her out again?
eight weeks, sir. But you don't have eight weeks, so I'll do it in two.
have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
your reputation is secure, Scotty.
mr Sulu, take the Con. I'll be in my quarters.
sir?
are they planning a ceremony when we get in?
I mean, a reception? - Would you like a hero's welcome?
well, God knows there should be.
this time we've paid for the party with our dearest blood.
steady. Steady, boys.
keep scanning.
I thought you people were reliable. Where the hell is he?
he's been here for some time. Put me on hailing frequency.
commander Kruge... This is Valkris.
I have purchased the Genesis data. Ready to transmit.
well done, Valkris.
what the hell is...
disengage cloaking device!
transmit data. Now!
transmission completed.
you will find it useful.
I have, my Lord.
unfortunate.
understood.
thrusters.
what the hell's going on? When do I get paid off?
soon, Captain. Quite soon.
success, my Lord... and my love.
you will be remembered with honour.
fire!
new course. Federation neutral zone.
feed him!
Yes, my Lord.
approach Control, this is Enterprise, ready for docking manoeuvre.
enterprise is cleared to dock. - Lock on.
systems locked.
enjoy the ride, and welcome home. - Enterprise confirms.
acknowledge, doors closed.
would you look at that!
my friends, the great experiment.
the Excelsior. Ready for trial runs.
she's supposed to have transwarp drive.
and if my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a wagon.
young minds, fresh ideas. Be tolerant, Mr Scott.
standby umbilical and gravitational support systems.
aye, sir, moorings activated, all systems standing by.
Admiral. This is not possible. - Mr Chekov.
an energy reading from 'C' deck, from inside Mr Spock's quarters.
I ordered Spock's quarters sealed. - I sealed the room myself!
nevertheless, I am reading a lifeform there.
this entire crew seems on the edge of obsessive behaviour regarding Spock.
sir, Security reports the door to Spock's quarters has been forced.
I'm on my way. Sulu, continue docking procedures.
Jim...
help me.
you left me on Genesis. Why did you do that?
help me.
bones!
what the hell are you doing?
have you lost your mind?
help me, Jim. Take me home.
bones, we are. We are home.
then perhaps it's not too late.
climb the steps, Jim.
climb the steps of Mount Seleya.
mount Seleya?
bones, Mount Seleya's on Vulcan. We're home... on Earth.
remember.
Admiral, docking is completed.
Starfleet Commander Morrow is on his way for inspection.
Uhura, get the medics down here! Get them now!
you've all done remarkable service under the most difficult conditions.
you'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendation.
and more importantly... extended shore leave.
all but you, Mr Scott. They need your wisdom on the new Excelsior.
report there tomorrow as Captain of Engineering.
with all appreciation, I'd prefer to supervise the refit of Enterprise.
I'm afraid that won't be necessary.
but, sir...
I'm sorry, Mr Scott, but there will be no refit.
Admiral... I don't understand. The Enterprise is not...
Jim, the Enterprise is 20 years old. We feel her day is over.
but we had requested...
we had hoped to take her back to Genesis.
that is out of the question. - May I ask why?
in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy.
until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis.
consider it a quarantine planet... and a forbidden subject.
to understand the events on which I report, it is necessary to review the theoretical data on the Genesis device, as developed by Doctors Carol and David Marcus.
genesis, simply put, is life from lifelessness.
the device was to be introduced into a pre-selected area of a lifeless space body, a moon or other dead form.
instead of a dead moon, a living, breathing planet now exists, capable of sustaining whatever life forms we see fit to deposit on it.
so?
speak.
great power to control, dominate.
speak. - Impressive.
they can make a planet.
Oh, yes. New cities, homes in the country.
your woman at your side, children playing at your feet.
and overhead, fluttering in the breeze, the flag of the Federation!
charming.
station. - Yes, my Lord.
share this with no one. - Understood, my Lord.
we are going to this planet.
even as our emissaries negotiate for peace with the Federation, we will act for the preservation of our race.
we will seize the secret of this weapon.
the secret of ultimate power!
success, my Lord.
we have reached the destination planet at point 035.
very well, Lieutenant. Helm.
execute standard orbital approach.
send a coded message for Starfleet Commander, Priority One.
federation science vessel Grissom arriving Genesis, Mutara Sector, to begin research. J. T. Esteban commanding.
dr Marcus, it's your planet.
begin scanning, please.
this is where the fun begins, Saavik.
just like your father, so human.
all units functional. Recorders are on. Scanning Sector 1.
the foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature 22. 2 Celsius.
sector 2 indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation. Temperature 39. 4.
sector 3, sub-tropical vegetation.
temperature decreasing rapidly.
it's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
fascinating.
all the varieties of land and weather known to Earth, within hours' walk.
metallic mass. - Close range scan.
a photon tube.
gravitational fields were in flux. It must have soft landed.
in code to Starfleet:
captain Spock's tube located on Genesis surface.
I don't believe it.
what is it?
if equipment is functioning properly, indications are an animal lifeform.
you said there wouldn't be any. - There shouldn't be.
cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable lifeform reading.
you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
we don't know what we're talking about here.
why don't we beam it up? - Oh, no.
regulations state, "Nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination is eliminated.
captain, beaming down to the surface is permitted.
if the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably safe.
please, we must see what it is. - Or who.
absent friends.
Admiral, what's going to happen to the Enterprise?
she's to be decommissioned. - Will we get another ship?
I can't get an answer. Starfleet's up to its brass in galactic conference.
no one has time for those who stand and wait.
sir, about Dr McCoy, how is he?
he's home, resting comfortably, pumped full of tranquilizers.
they say it's exhaustion. He promised he'd stay put. We'll see.
Ah, Mr Scott.
come.
Sarek!
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
please excuse us.
ambassador, I would have come to Vulcan to express my deep sympathy.
spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government.
I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Spock trusted you. And you denied him his future.
I saw no future. - Only his body was in death, Kirk.
and you were the last one to be with him.
then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
but why? - Because he asked you to!
he entrusted you......with his very essence, with everything that was not of the body!
he asked you to bring him to us.
and to bring that which he gave you: His Katra. His living spirit.
sir...
your son meant more to me than you can know.
I'd have given my life if it would have saved his.
believe me when I tell you... he made no request of me.
he would not have spoken of it openly.
then how was...
I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
certainly.
he spoke of your friendship.
Yes.
he... asked you not to grieve.
Yes.
the needs of the many......outweigh......the needs of the few...or the one.
Spock...I have been......and always shall be your friend.
no.
forgive me.
it is not here.
I had assumed he mind-melded with you.
it is the Vulcan way... when the body's end is near.
we were separated.
he couldn't touch me.
then everything that he was......everything he knew......is lost.
please wait.
he would have found a way. If there was that much at stake, Spock would have found a way.
Yes. But how?
what if he joined with someone else?
engine Room, Flight Recorder Visual. Star date 8128. 78.
go.
ship... out of danger?
Yes.

No! You'll flood the whole compartment!
he'll die. - Captain! He's dead already.
back, 0. 76.

what is Mr Scott's condition? - I don't think that he...
sorry, Doctor, I have no time to discuss this logically.
freeze.
repeat... and augment.
remember...
McCoy!
what must I do?
you must bring them to Mount Seleya on Vulcan.
only there can both find peace.
what you ask......is difficult.
you will find a way, Kirk.
if you honour them both, you must.
I will.
transporter Room, stand by to energise.
aye, sir, energising now.
Grissom to Saavik. We're picking up radiation from the lifeform.
affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
exercise caution, Lieutenant.
this landing is Captain's discretion, and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
I'll try to remember that.
there are your lifeforms. These were microbes on the tube's surface.
we shot them here from Enterprise. They were fruitful and multiplied.
but how could they have evolved so quickly?
Saavik...
what is it?
Spock's burial robe.
but I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules.
don't quote rules to me. I'm talking about loyalty and sacrifice.
one man who's died for us, another with deep emotional problems.
this business about Spock and McCoy...
honestly, I never understood Vulcan mysticism.
you don't have to believe. I'm not even sure that I believe.
but if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul......then it's my responsibility. - Yours?
as surely as if it were my very own.
give me back the Enterprise. With Scotty's help I could...
the Enterprise would never stand the pounding, and you know it!
then I'll hire a ship. - Out of the question, my friend.
the Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis.
your life and your career stand for rationality, not intellectual chaos.
you'll destroy yourself. Do you understand me, Jim?
I hear you.
I had to try.
of course.
thanks for the drink. - Any time.
the word, sir? - The word......is no. I am therefore going anyway.
you can count on our help, sir. - Shall I alert Dr McCoy?
please. He has a long journey ahead of him.
long time, Doc.
Yeah. Anybody been looking for me?
I have, but what's the use? What'll it be?
to expect one to order poison in a bar is not logical.
got it.
to your planet, welcome.
I think that's my line, stranger. - Oh, forgive.
I here am new. But you are known, being McCoy from Enterprise.
you have me at a disadvantage, sir. - I name not important.
you seek I. Message received.
available ship stands by.
how much and how soon?
how soon is now. How much is where.
somewhere in the Mutara Sector. - Oh, Mutara restricted!
take permits many. Money more.
there aren't going to be any damn permits!
how can you get a permit to do a damn illegal thing?
look... Price you name, money I got!
place you name, money I name, otherwise bargain, no.
all right, dammit! Genesis. The name of the place we're going is Genesis!
Genesis?!
Yes, Genesis! How can you be deaf with ears like that?
genesis allowed is not! It's planet forbidden!
look, my backward friend. Genesis may be planet forbidden, but I'm...
sir, I'm sorry. You don't want to be discussing this subject in public.
I'll discuss what I like! And who in the hell are you?!
would you like a ride home, Dr McCoy?
if I wanted a ride home, would I be trying to charter a space flight?
how in the hell do you know who I am?
federation Security, sir.
you're gonna get a nice long rest, Doctor.
Saavik to Grissom. We are definitely reading a second lifeform.
we concur. Proceed with caution, Saavik.
what the hell is going on down there?
be quick, Admiral. They're moving him to the Federation 'Funny Farm'.
Yes, poor friend. I hear he's fruity as a nutcake.
two minutes.
Jim!
how many fingers do I have up? - That's not very damn funny.
your sense of humour has returned. - The hell it has. What's that?
you're suffering from a Vulcan mind-meld, Doctor.
that green-blooded son-of-a-bitch.
it's his revenge for all those arguments he lost.
let me see your hand. This will make you well enough to travel.
Where's Admiral Kirk? - With the prisoner.
get him quickly. Commander, Starfleet, wants him right away.
don't get smart, Tiny.
Admiral, Starfleet... - This man's sick. Look.
side elevator. Agents on their way up.
don't call me Tiny.
unit Two, this is unit One.
the Koyabashi Maru has set sail for the promised land.
message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
you're taking me to the promised land?
what are friends for?
mr Scott... Calling it a night?
looking forward to breaking some of Enterprise's speed records tomorrow.
good night.
level, please. - Transporter Room.
thank you. - Up your shaft!
Roger, Old City Station at 22. 00 hours. All is well.
understood. All stations clear.
a 20-year space veteran, you choose the worst duty station in town.
I mean, look at this place! This is the hind end of space.
peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
maybe that's okay for someone like you, whose career is winding down.
but me, I need some challenge in my life, adventure.
maybe even just a surprise or two.
well, you know what they say. Be careful what you wish for.
you may get it.
good evening, Commander. Is everything ready?
step into my parlour, gentlemen.
that's Admiral Kirk, my God. - Very good for you, Lieutenant.
but it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded IDs.
I'm not going to do anything, but you're going to sit in the closet.
have you lost all your sense of reality?
this isn't reality.
this is fantasy. You wanted adventure, how's this?
the old adrenalin going, huh? Good boy.
go on. Go on! - I'll just get in the closet.
okay!
I'm glad you're on our side. - Can you handle that?
I'll have Mr Adventure eating out of my hand, sir.
and I'll see all of you at the rendezvous. And Admiral...
all my hopes.
as promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready.
thank you, Mr Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.
my friends, I can't ask you to go any further.
dr McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Admiral, we're losing precious time.
what course, please, Admiral? - Mr Scott?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
gentlemen... May the wind be at our backs. Stations, please.
clear all moorings. - Cleared, sir.
one quarter impulse power. - One quarter impulse.
commander, Starfleet, on emergency channel.
no reply, Chekov. Steady as she goes, Sulu.

this is the Captain. How can you have a Yellow Alert in spacedock?
sir, someone is stealing the Enterprise.
I'm on my way.

standby tractor beam. - Tractor beam, on.
if he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's in for a shock.
excelsior closing to 4, 000 metres, sir.
we'll need everything you have. - Warp Drive standing by.
Kirk...
if you do this, you'll never sit in the Captain's chair again.
warp Speed. - Aye, sir. Warp Speed.
prepare for Warp Speed. Stand by Transwarp Drive.
transwarp at your command. - Full power available.
execute.
...power available.
full power available.
transwarp Drive, maximum velocity in five, four, three, two, one.
Scotty, as good as your word.
the more they overtake the plumbing, the easier to stop up the drain.
here, Doctor, souvenirs from one surgeon to another.
I took them out of her main Transwarp computer drive.
nice of you to tell me in advance. - You missed the staff meeting.
your work today has been outstanding.
I will recommend you all for promotion......in whatever fleet we end up serving. Best speed to Genesis.
I am Saavik. Can you speak?
the Genesis Wave. His cells could have been regenerated.
captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead. - We have found the life sign.
it is a Vulcan child, perhaps eight to ten Earth years of age.
a child?! How did he get there? - It is Dr Marcus' opinion that......that the Genesis effect has in some way regenerated... Captain Spock.
Saavik, that's... extraordinary. What would you like to do next?
request permission to beam aboard immediately.
does Dr Marcus think there's any chance of radioactive contamination?
no. - None that he can detect, sir.
I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve. - But let's do it by the book.
standby on this channel. Go.
Starfleet Command, this is USS Grissom on coded channel 98. 8.
sir, something is jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Locate!
sir, it's from astern!
Oh, my God.
Gunner... Target engine only.
captain, what is happening? - We're under attack!
stand by for evasive.
fire.
I wanted prisoners!
a lucky shot, sir...
sir, may I suggest... - Say the wrong thing, Torg!
there are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
Saavik calling Grissom... - Very good.
Grissom, this is Saavik on emergency frequency. Come in, please.
what happened to them?
it would seem the Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
we must go. They will soon come after us.
estimating Genesis, 2. 9 hours present speed.
can we hold speed, Scotty? - Aye, she's got her second wind now.
scan for vessels in pursuit. - Scanning. Indications negative.
did I get it right?
great, Bones, just great.
it's time for total truth between us.
this planet is not what you intended or hoped for, is it?
not exactly.
Why?
I used proto-matter in the Genesis matrix.
an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
it was the only way to solve certain problems.
so, like your father, you changed the rules.
if I hadn't, it might have been years, or never!
how many have paid the price for your impatience?
how many have died? How much damage have you done?
and what is yet to come?
bridge, nothing happening here.
this planet is ageing in surges. - And Spock with it.
it seems they're joined together. - They are.
how long?
days. Maybe hours.
I'm sorry.
it will be hardest on Spock.
I don't understand. - Pon Farr.
Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
whoever they are, they're getting closer.
I'll go. - No.
I'll do it. Give me your phaser.
sir, Starfleet calling USS Grissom. A warning about us.
response? - Nothing. As before.
what's the Grissom up to? Will she join us or fire on us?
Chekov, break silence. Send Captain Esteban my compliments.
how are we doing? - How are we doing?
funny you should put it quite that way, Jim.
we are doing fine. But I'd feel safer giving him one of my kidneys than what's scrambled in my brain.
no response from Grissom on any channel.
keep trying. At regular intervals.
so it has come.
PON Farr.
will you trust me?
we are secured from Warp Speed. Now entering Genesis Sector.
proceed at impulse power.
vessel entering sector. - Yes.
not yet.
engage cloaking device.
I'd swear there was something there, sir.
what did you see?
for an instant, a scout class vessel.
could be Grissom. Patch in the hailing frequency.
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Please come in.
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Do you read?
I've come a long way for the power of Genesis.
and what do I find?
a weakling human, a Vulcan boy and a woman.
my Lord, we are survivors of a doomed expedition.
this planet will destroy itself soon. The Genesis experiment is a failure.
a failure?
the most powerful destructive force ever created.
you will tell me the secret of the Genesis torpedo.
I have no knowledge.
then I hope pain is something you enjoy.
I ordered no interruptions. - But, sir...
federation Starship approaching. - Bring me up.
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Please come in.
battle Alert!
Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik.
report status. - We are cloaked.

if my guess is right, they'll have to de-cloak before they can fire.

sir, the shield's non-responsive. - Scotty?
the automation system's overloaded. I didn't expect combat, you know.
emergency power. Prepare to return fire.
I've got no control over anything. - Mr Sulu?
nothing, sir.
so... we're a sitting duck.
ready to fire emergency tube.
my Lord. The enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
put them on screen.
this is Admiral James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
...between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, ...your presence here is an act of war.
you have two minutes to surrender your crew and your vessel......or we will destroy you. - He's hiding something.
we may have dealt him a more serious blow than I thought.
how can you tell that? - I trust my instincts.
Admiral Kirk, this is your opponent speaking.
don't lecture me about treaty violations!
in creating an ultimate weapon, the Federation has become criminals!
it is not I who will surrender, it is you!
from the team who developed your doomsday weapon.
if you don't surrender, I'll execute them as enemies of galactic peace!
who is this? How dare you take prisoners?
who I am is not important. That I have them is.
you may speak to them.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik. - Saavik!
is David with you? - Yes, and someone else.
a Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
this... Vulcan...
is he alive?
he is not himself, but he lives.
he's subject to rapid ageing, like this unstable planet.
Hello, sir, it's David.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I should've known you'd come. It's true, this planet is unstable.
it's gonna destroy itself within hours.
David, what went wrong?
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender.
genesis doesn't work. I can't believe they'd kill us for it.
Admiral, your friend is mistaken, I meant what I said.
wait! Give me a chance to talk...
kill one of them. I don't care which.
Saavik?
David?
you Klingon bastard, you've killed my son.
Klingon bastard, you've killed my son!
you Klingon bastard!
there are two more prisoners, Admiral.
do you want them killed, too?
surrender your vessel.
all right.
I give two minutes to you and your gallant crew.
take every last man, form a boarding party, armed heavily!
they outnumber us, my Lord. - We are Klingons!
once you control the ship we will transfer our flag there
about a dozen officers and men.
with some of them on the planet.
I swear to you, we're not finished yet.
we have a job to do.
commander Klingon vessel. Prepare to board this ship on my next signal.
no tricks, Kirk! You have one minute.
no tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you.

how can that be? They're hiding.
it's the only thing speaking. - Speaking? Let me hear.

get out! ...one...
my God, Bones. What have I done?
what you had to do. What you always do.
turn death into a fighting chance to live.

what about surface life signs?

what happened? - He gave his life to save us.
what about his mind? - His mind's a void.
is there anything we can do? - Only one thing.
get him off this planet. His ageing is part of what's going on around us.
Klingon Commander, this is Admiral James T. Kirk.
I'm alive and well on the planet's surface.
I know this will come as a pleasant surprise to you.
our ship was a victim of an unfortunate accident.
sorry about your crew, but as we say on Earth, "C'est la vie."
I have what you want.
I have the secret of Genesis.
do you hear me?
I'm waiting for you!
what is your answer?
drop all weapons!
Maltz... Prisoners at beam coordinates.
you should take the Vulcan too. - No!
but why? - Because you wish it.
Maltz... Activate beam!
genesis. I want it!
beam the Vulcan up, and we'll talk.
give me what I want and I'll consider it.
fool! Look around you! The planet's destroying itself!
if we don't help each other, we'll die here!
give me Genesis!
give me your hand! - Kirk!
I... have had......enough of you!
don't! How many more?
just him, sir.
bones, help Spock.
we've got to break out of orbit.
you, help us or die.
fine, I'll kill you later. Let's get out of here.
No! This!
that or nothing.
if I read this right, sir, we have full power.
go, Sulu.
goodbye, David.
we are clear and free to navigate.
best speed to Vulcan. Mr Chekov, take the prisoner below.
Spock...
for God's sake, talk to me!
you stuck this damn thing in my head, remember?
remember?
now, tell me what to do with it.
help me.
I'm gonna tell you something that I......never thought I'd hear myself say.
but it seems I've missed you.
I don't know if I could stand to lose you again.
ambassador, they are on approach.
they're requesting permission to land.
tell Kirk we'll be ready.
mr Sulu, you're on manual.
it's been a while, sir. Here we go.
Retrothrusters.
Sarek is waiting above, sir.
Sarek...
child of Skon, child of Solkar...
the body of your son breathes still.
what is your wish?
I ask for Fal-Tor-Pan. The refusion.
what you seek has not been done since ages past, and then only in legend.
your request is not logical.
forgive me, T'Lar.
my logic is uncertain where my son is concerned.
who is the keeper of the Katra?
I am.
McCoy, Leonard H. son of David.
McCoy, Son of David...
since thou art human, we cannot expect thee to understand fully what Sarek has requested.
Spock's body lives.
with your approval, we shall use all our powers
but McCoy, you must now be warned.
the danger to thyself is as grave as the danger to Spock.
you must make the choice.
hell of a time to ask.
I'm all right, Jim.
what about Spock?
only time will answer.
Kirk... I thank you. What you have done is...
what I have done...
...I had to do.
but at what cost?
your ship. Your son.
if I hadn't tried... the cost would have been my soul.
my father says that you have been my friend.
you came back for me.
you would have done the same for me.
why would you do this?
because the needs of the many.....outweigh the needs of the one.
I have been...
Yes.
Yes, Spock!
the ship. Out of danger?
you saved the ship.
you saved us all. Don't you remember?
Jim.
your name is Jim.
Yes.
clone Cadets \n \n
clone troopers unite!
as war rages across the galaxy,
the Republic's clone army strives for victory against the evil forces of the Separatists.
bravery, valor, unity:
the lifeblood of victory on the battlefield and in space.
it all begins on the planet Kamino, where Jedi General Shaak Ti oversees the training of clones with the help of contracted bounty hunters.
bred to be perfect soldiers, these cadets must first be subjected to intense physical and mental training before heading off to war...
you're clear. You're clear!
cover fire!
this is command:
you must break through enemy lines and take the tower.
comlink just relayed orders from...
we all heard the orders, Echo!
stop calling me that.
stop repeating every order.
less yappin'; more blastin'.
let's smoke these chrome domes and move on to the citadel.
CT-782, you're breaking formation.
just follow my lead, will ya?
he's clearing a path.
I'm moving.
Thanks, CT-27-5555.
that was close.
it's Fives. The name is "Fives.
Yeah, five pieces if you don't keep your head down!
how about we follow orders?
this is our last practice test.
will you shut up with instructions?
you're not in charge.
this particular unit seems to have some trouble.
what do you recommend?
well, I'm no Jedi, so forgive my bluntness, but I say they fail.
send 'em down to maintenance duty with 99 and the other rejects.
we can't fail them yet.
remember, this is only a practice test.
and besides, the citadel course was constructed to be a difficult challenge.
although I don't agree with his sentiment,
bric isn't wrong.
these cadets are far from ready.
I can't hit anything from here.
no, we have to follow orders.
the one they call "Echo" never adapts to the situation.
CT-782 seems to follow his own path.
he can't do it all alone.
you go; I'll cover you.
I'm a better shot. You go.
no, you go!
look at those two, argue on the battlefield and end up dead.
uh, and the last one...
I surrender. I surrender.
need I say more?
if these cadets can't get past their shortsighted selfishness, they will never come together.
unity wins war, gentlemen.
computer, end exercise for Domino squad.
99, would you please send a cleaning crew to the training ground?
Yes, Mistress. We'll take care of the mess.
you should tell that 99 to drag away the mess called Domino squad.
we almost had it this time.
Oh, yeah, and we all look nothing alike either.
sorry about the mess, 99.
uh, it's okay, boys.
nice try.
so I says to her, "baby, you and me could really...
you've never even met a girl.
you know, you shouldn't worry because most clones pass.
Yeah, but not all of us. Right, shortie?
guys, we've got to follow orders. Come on.
I don't know. I think it went rather well.
quit joking around.
can we please stop arguing?
can you stop being droid bait out there?
you're getting in my way.
actually, our way.
well, you want to be the best, then you got to think like it.
and I'm thinking like an ARC trooper.
arc troopers follow orders.
care to repeat that, Echo?
come on. Get him, Hevy! Smack that know-it-all!
cut it out!
if you two would focus on fighting droids as much as you do fighting each other,
you might stand a chance out there.
sorry, master chief.
well, master chief, maybe our problems come from our training.
I'd rather be taught by a Jedi than some mercenary bounty hunter.
Jedi don't have the time to train grunts like you.
that's why they hired me.
listen, boys, when you were assigned to me,
I had high hopes for you.
now we're approaching the end of your training, and you haven't advanced nearly enough.
even this bad batcher, 99, has more sense than you guys do, and he's a maintenance clone.
you...you don't give them enough credit.
you're all a waste of my time.
I understand your concerns, Master Jedi.
ever since the unfortunate death of Jango Fett, we have had to stretch his DNA to produce more clones.
a Jedi does not feel concern, Lama Su.
however, I have noticed this unit of clones have been...
Deficient?
my only thought is for you to search the galaxy and find a suitable donor for your future clones.
and what of the clones produced so far?
as you know, there is no one way to make a clone.
sometimes our efforts are less than successful.
are you suggesting we just cast off the Domino squad?
they're living beings, not objects.
you Jedi show too much compassion.
nevertheless, as General in charge of training, the decision on what to do with them would be yours, Master Jedi.
gentlemen, who wants to be an ARC trooper?
I do, sir!
you have to pass your final test first.
I want you to meet Commander Colt of the Rancor battalion.
I want you troopers to remember, we're shoulder to shoulder on those front lines.
brothers.
and sometimes we may quarrel,
but no matter what, we are united.
rule one:
we fight together.
so who's ready to step up first?
let's start with the unit that ran the practice test in record time...
arc trooper time.
think he means us, boys?
Bravo unit, step up.
well, bravo for bravo squad.
show an ARC trooper how it's done.
come on, boys.
maybe we can learn something.
shut up, Echo.
start the citadel challenge, version THX, variable 1138.
go right!
clankers!
we're better than these guys.
okay, this is it.
go for it.
he's going to make it.
I'm impressed.
you trained 'em well.
who's next?
the Domino squad.
and how are they?
we can do this, guys.
all we have to do is follow orders.
check it out, guys.
time to watch the dominoes fall.
they are so much better than us.
knock it off!
begin the program.
let's not take it easy on them.
they're getting farther than normal.
maybe so, but they're sloppy.
this is nothing.
give them their next set of orders and watch the chaos ensue.
I'm telling you, these guys just aren't ready.
I'll flank left.
you flank right.
take it easy. I'm on your side. Get it?
your side, huh?
pretty unorthodox.
Droidbait, behind you!
man down!
forget him!
I'm breaking for the citadel.
Hurry!
guys, I think he's injured.
leave him. Come on!
we're gonna pass this time.
okay, I spoke too soon.
that would be putting it marbly.
broke formation, disobeyed orders, and you left a man behind.
you broke rule number one.
I'm sorry, Domino squad.
this is an automatic failure.
I told you this was going to happen.
we've wasted enough time on those losers.
their failure is our failure.
I've made a request to General Shaak Ti that the Domino squad be allowed to repeat the final test.
why do you care about them?
why don't you?
I care about getting paid.
it's a shame the bounty hunter in you sees this only as a job.
more like an impossible task.
these cadets will be the finest troopers we've trained.
I have faith in them.
faith?
Oh, you can't be serious, El-Les.
we should treat them as a special challenge, Bric.
we should treat them as failures.
besides, I've already requested that they be moved to cleanup and maintenance.
that's all they're going to be good for.
then I guess the General has a decision to make.
general, may we have a word?
you are here to discuss your squad, aren't you?
how did you... - Ah, Jedi, mate.
one doesn't need to be a Jedi to feel the stress on your mind.
general, we would like to request a transfer to another squad.
Bravo squad, perhaps?
I am a Jedi, where the individual and the group are one in the same, much like you clones.
which is why Fives and I are looking out for each other.
as individuals, but not as a group.
you are where you need to be.
solve your problems as a whole, not as individuals.
I have decided to allow you and the rest of your squad to take the test again tomorrow.
you wanted to see me, sir?
near as I can tell, you're the reason your squad's a failure.
Ah, well, I'll take that as a compliment.
it's all a big joke to you, right?
like those little nicknames you and your clone brothers give each other.
Oh, I could think of one for you right now, sir.
Oh, funny.
but I think it's all just a cover.
you hate me, don't you?
Oh, no. No, no, no.
how could I hate you for doing your job?
you're just pushing me, sir.
no, this is me pushing you.
come on, clone. Hit me.
hit me, you joker.
can't take anything seriously, can you?
you're a real cutup, aren't you?
come on!
thank you, sir.
for what?
for my name: Cutup.
I like the sound of it.
out of my sight, cadet.
one way or another, you'll be out of this army.
count on it.
hevy, you going somewhere?
get out of here.
you're going awol, aren't you?
just go back to sleep, 99.
this doesn't concern you.
but you can't do this to your squad.
my squad?
we're nothing but a bad batch.
failures.
like you.
Yeah, but how can I be a failure when I...I never even got my chance?
a chance you're throwing away.
you're always trying to be the anchor, Hevy.
you know, do it on your own.
well, maybe you should embrace the fact that you have a team.
see, I never had that.
but you need them, and they need you.
why carry such a heavy burden on your own when you have your brothers at your side, Hevy?
Hevy?
would you stop calling me that!
we're just numbers, 99.
just numbers.
not to me.
to me, you've always had a name.
Hey, where's CT-782?
Yeah, where is CT-782?
if he is not here, we will fail.
not today, brothers.
today we pass.
and one more thing: the name's Hevy.
orders came in clear, mates.
nothing to repeat, Echo?
not today.
how's that shoulder treating you?
I'll live.
we all know what we have to do.
that's it, boys. Stay together!
fives, on your left.
Thanks, Cutup.
no problem, brother.
they seem to be working together.
still early.
a lot can change.
keep it up. We're doing great.
we might actually pass.
not so fast; still got the citadel.
all right, prep the ascension cables.
let's scale this thing.
wait a tick.
where are the cables?
they're not in our belts.
just when things seemed easy.
well, we can't scale the face without them.
we'll fail the test if we can't finish.
what's going on?
where are their ascension cables?
Ah, must have gotten lost.
what did you do?
I thought you had faith they'd be the best, right?
well, the best pass, no matter what.
general, you have to stop this.
this is unfair to the cadets.
adversity in war is a constant, El-Les.
but Bric has cheated.
the enemy won't play fair either.
so this is it?
not exactly.
those guns up there...
we can use them as a step to the next level.
form a chain, and use each other to scale this face.
use the guns?
are you crazy?
trust me. I know weapons.
I'm gonna draw their fire.
you guys blast 'em.
well, I'll be...
creative little clones, aren't they?
no unit has shown such ingenuity.
we did it!
I knew we could do it, boys!
bric, your actions have brought out the best in these cadets.
looks like they were well-trained, perhaps the finest soldiers I've ever seen.
well, maybe you were right, El-Les.
Congratulations.
you've graduated.
at ease.
next stop, ARC trooper.
Yeah, how 'bout we face some combat first?
you were right, you know, about everything.
I heard you were quite the leader out there.
no leaders. We are a team.
all of us, 99.
the army's lucky to have a clone like you, Hevy.
not as lucky as I am to have a brother like you.
well, this is good-bye, I guess.
Hevy ships out, and 99 stays here.
eh, we'll see each other again.
I mean, how else am I supposed to get this back from you?
you deserve it.
you're one of us.
today is your graduation.
from here, you ship out to fight against the Separatists and restore peace to the Republic.
Congratulations.
you are no longer cadets.
you are troopers.
may the Force be with you.
attention!
helmets on!
arc Troopers \n
separatist attack!
after the destruction of the Republic outpost on the Rishi moon,
general Grievous and Asajj Ventress plan an attack on the planet Kamino, home of the cloning factories.
meanwhile, aboard a Jedi cruiser
Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi examine an intercepted message from General Grievous.
we are decrypting the audio, sir.
the clone planet of Kamino will be a dangerous target.
just make sure you hold up your half of the mission.
we must stop the production of new clones if we are to win this war.
Kamino.
they're going to attack our home planet.
the Separatists are taking quite the chance even considering this.
with all due respect, General, if someone comes to our home, they better be carrying a big blaster.
I concur with Captain Rex, sir.
this is personal for us clones.
we'll make sure Kamino is secure.
tell your troopers in the 501st they're going home.
Yes, sir.
all is ready, General.
good. We will attack Tipoca City first.
I have the exact locations of both the clone DNA room and the clone trooper barracks.
both shall be annihilated under my hand.
our hands, General.
count Dooku assigned us both this task.
but of course, assassin.
I look forward to meeting you.
are the aqua droids prepared for phase two of the plan?
Yes, mistress.
masters Kenobi and Skywalker, welcome to Kamino.
greetings, Generals.
I wish our arrival wasn't under such circumstances.
we believe Grievous is planning a Separatist attack on Kamino.
but the Republic blockade is far too strong.
they would not dare.
Ah, look around, Fives.
feels like yesterday we were here, heading to target practice.
heh, remember that?
do I ever.
Hey, 99.
ha, Echo. Fives.
you actually remember us.
Oh, I remember all my brothers.
is Hevy here? Where's he?
there was an incident on the Rishi moon outpost.
he saved our lives, but he gave up his own.
uh, I...I see.
Hevy gave you his medal?
so why have you returned to Kamino?
the Generals received word of an impending attack here.
well, how can I help?
attack formation Echo-3.
status.
deflector shields raised.
destroyers in position.
forward cannons ready.
landing craft prepared.
all ships are in position.
commence attack.
the Separatist fleet is pressing their attack, sir.
contact command at Tipoca City.
shore up our defenses.
the fleet is not as large as I expected.
begin the air strike.
good to see you, General.
ready to have some fun?
you know me, Broadside.
I'd rather be up here than stuck in a command center.
warning! Falling debris.
grievous appears to be sacrificing his transports in favor of protecting his command ship.
something's not right.
reinforcements have arrived.
send out the aqua droids to assemble the assault craft.
focus on the cruisers.
I'm gonna press the attack, Master.
no, Anakin. Wait.
it's too easy.
not even Grievous would attack so recklessly.
master, the battle's up here in space, not down there.
the debris from the destroyed Separatist ships is the key.
what are you thinking?
I think I'd like to go for a swim.
nothing as of yet.
only you could be worried about the ships I already shot down.
wait a minute.
aqua droids.
looks as though they're assembling assault craft.
Anakin, I was right.
those downed transports were hiding ships for an underwater assault.
Anakin, come in!
hold it right there.
do not move.
thanks for the lift, friend.
Anakin, the city is under attack!
I need you down here now!
on my way.
sir, you sent for us?
it's a dangerous assignment, but I want you two up on the bridge in sniper positions.
Yes, sir. - We're on it.
watch out!
kill them all!
99, get out of here!
this is no place for you.
there aren't enough droids here to capture the city.
they're trying to distract us.
go protect the DNA chamber.
I'll deal with Grievous.
got it.
fives, keep firing.
we can beat these guys.
99
I...I brought you some ammo.
is there a better spot than this, a better defensive position we can take?
droids! Behind us!
look! Grenades!
Thanks, 99. Good job.
look out. There's more!
cadets. What are you doing here?
we got separated from our group.
where were they taking you?
the barracks.
Oh, I know the best way there.
keep firing. No mercy!
your skills are impressive.
perhaps a match for my own, assassin.
count Dooku may have taught you how to swing a lightsaber, General, but that hardly makes you my equal.
and yet I am the General in charge of this assault.
remember, assassin, you are to recover the clone DNA.
why not just destroy it?
because the DNA could unlock new possibilities for us.
keep playing with your droids.
I'll handle breaking into the DNA room.
shall I provide you with a droid escort?
my dear General, there's nothing you have that I could want.
what are we gonna do?
a Separatist victory means death for all of us.
the cadet is right.
what are we gonna do?
we fight.
but our training's not finished.
look around.
we're one in the same, same heart, same blood.
your training is in your blood.
and my blood's boiling for a fight.
this is our home. This is our war.
what about weapons?
the armory.
it's just a few corridors away here in the barracks.
I can retrieve all the firepower that we need.
hah, so who wants to blast some droids?
the droids are spread thin.
we must press our offensive now.
I was beginning to think my presence went unnoticed.
you weren't planning on leaving without saying hello, were you?
ha, here it is.
everything we need is here.
excellent work, 99.
hurry up. The droids have almost reached the barracks.
let's get into position.
open up.
get those doors open and scare the remaining clones out of hiding.
Roger, roger.
blast them.
all too easy.
define "easy," General.
Kenobi.
Kenobi, Kamino has fallen.
your clone army is doomed.
I beg to differ, Grievous.
cadets, now!
last one, Commander.
make it count.
I'll get more.
99, you can't.
I'm a soldier like you.
this is what I was bred for.
99, no!
commander Cody.
Yes, sir.
the droids have been pushed back to the main hangar.
we've got to stop meeting like this, my friend.
move it, troopers!
on the double!
fire!
look! It's the General!
I suppose you expect me to surrender.
actually I plan to let the clones execute you right now.
not this time.
we did it. We held them back!
we lost a true soldier.
he really was one of us.
echo, Fives.
you both really stepped up in the heat of battle.
we did what we had to do, sir, what any clone would have done.
both of you showed valor out there, real courage.
reminded me of me, actually.
echo, Fives, you're both officially being made ARC troopers.
I don't think the Separatists will be coming back here any time soon.
but if they do,
Kamino will be lucky to have clones like you defending it.
good job, men!
you have some wraith DNA.
my father told people that it was a gift.
Ah, they've picked up my signal.
a subspace tracking device.
I had it implanted.
the hives are firing on each other.
are you sure? - Definitely.
they're not pulling any punches either.
so all it took was the destruction of my ship for you to finally trust me.
Oh, not true, I still don't trust you.
I've refined the retrovirus to create the perfect balance
ability well beyond any normal human, but without the one weakness that will be the downfall of the wraith...
the need to feed.
I still say we should've brought backup.
another jumper, or a marine unit, something.
this is intended to be a diplomatic mission, Rodney.
what kind of message would that send?
well, a strong one, hopefully.
everybody's going to be fine if they don't panic.
easier said than done.
there they are.
my god, how big is that thing?
never seen a hive in space, huh?
I've never seen one period.
I mean, I've seen video logs, but never in person.
well, you never forget your first.
they know we're here.
apparently. We're receiving a transmission.
docking instructions.
what, no, "hello. Greetings, weary travelers?
guess not. So much for the red carpet.
so, what happens now?
well, if history has taught us anything, this is the part where we get double-crossed and taken prisoner.
that will not happen this time, rodney.
we were invited, remember?
and that makes a difference?
this looks a little familiar.
lower your weapons.
my apologies.
you understand.
you can't be too careful.
welcome to my ship.
the Queen
this is my second-in-command.
I've asked him to be a part of these discussions.
please, sit.
fruit bowl, nice touch.
well, we picked them up on our travels.
I thought it would make our discussions more comfortable.
I hope they prove as delicious as the farmers who grew them.
all right, let's just get this over with.
so, I understand you have a proposal, a breakthrough of some kind?
this is dr. Keller. She's our chief medical officer, and she's going to explain everything to you.
well, um...
uh, as you may already know, we recently stumbled across a lab belonging to michael, - the wraith that we-- - I know who he is.
of course you do.
word of your success against him spread rapidly among my kind.
we are very grateful.
trust me, we didn't do it for you.
anyway, we recovered a database from his lab that allowed us to continue his research into
for what purpose?
we've come up with a gene therapy that alters wraith DNA in a small but significant way.
in a nutshell-- we think we can make it so that you, and any other wraith we treat, will never need to feed on humans again.
this is absurd.
well, actually, it's not as big of a change as you might think.
your bodies already contain all the organs necessary to digest food.
here.
try this.
if I consume this, it may give me a moment's pleasure, but it will not sustain me.
but that can change, at least in theory.
why would we want this?
of what benefit is it?
well, think about it.
if you put yourself on regular food, you could give up all those tiresome cullings.
it would give you a significant advantage over other hives.
not to mention I could stop waiting for the chance to kill you, in theory.
our current feeding process gives us strength, our ability to heal, our longevity.
well, um, we're not entirely sure how this change would affect your, um... gifts.
they may continue, although possibly in a diminished form.
possibly?
we can't be sure until we administer it to, um, live subjects.
well, let's not forget that michael spread the modified hoffan drug to dozens of worlds, possibly more.
I mean, no one knows for sure, right?
which means that every time you feed, you're taking a risk.
bottom line is, there's not enough food to go around.
that's why you wraith are at each other's throats. So...
here's your chance.
this is wrong.
we shouldn't be here.
I don't know, from where I was sitting, things seemed to go pretty well.
Yeah.
you don't seem too happy about it.
I was just expecting a little more resistance.
well, he hasn't said yes yet.
Yeah, but something makes me think he wants to.
and why not? It is a reasonable offer.
why are we thinking of ways to fix them when we should be thinking of ways to kill them?
we've been trying to do that for four years. They're still here.
the wraith may not deserve our consideration, but as John pointed out, we're not doing this for them.
there's something going on here, something he's not telling us.
what a surprise.
I'm sorry.
am I disturbing you?
come in.
I have...considered your offer.
that was fast.
I believe your idea has merit, if you can make the treatment to work.
it'll work.
of course, converting a single hive would be pointless.
it would make little difference to the humans of this galaxy and would make us pariahs amongst are own kind.
wait a minute, I thought you worked with a whole group of hives.
I do, but I may have...exaggerated my position within the alliance.
he doesn't have the clout.
then he's no good to us.
there's only one you need to convince.
we call her the primary.
the uber-queen?
convince her, and the rest will fall into line.
then convince her.
she will only speak with another queen.
and your queen was killed last year in the skies above Atlantis.
regrettably, yes, but the primary does not know this.
you...
you bluffed your way into the alliance and convinced them you still have a queen?
they would not have accepted me otherwise.
up to now, I've been able to maintain this subterfuge, but a face-to-face meeting, that would be difficult.
in fact, there is only one person who could help me.
this is crazy.
believe me, this is not a decision I am taking lightly.
do you realize what he's asking you to do?
well, Dr. Keller assures me that the procedure is completely reversible and will have no lasting ill-effects.
I'm not talking about the procedure.
I know.
look, even if this works, even if all the wraith stop feeding, you think they're going to become nice and friendly overnight?
no.
they're going to have a massive technological advantage.
you're suggesting they will enslave the people of this galaxy rather than feed on them.
we've seen the same thing happen in our galaxy.
you didn't voice this objection before.
nobody was asking you to risk your life.
my wraith DNA makes me the only possible candidate.
anyone else would be detected by the queen immediately.
well, that's fine, by my question is, why now?
the wraith are busy killing each other. Why don't we just sit back and watch?
eventually, one faction will emerge victorious, and then everything will go back to the way it was.
but maybe not for a while, so we can afford to wait.
and if Todd's alliance is destroyed?
we may never have another opportunity like this again.
I admit, this may not solve the wraith problem once and for all, but there are people alive today who will be culled in the coming weeks and months, and if I can save even some of them, I have to try.
if not for myself, then for my son.
Colonel sheppard, come in.
this is Sheppard, go ahead.
Mr. Woolsey wanted me to inform you, sir, he's here.
you sure you're ready for this?
as ready as I'll ever be.
I'm sorry. I...
I feel like you're being pressured into this because of my research.
I am not being pressured into anything, and your research may save thousands, even millions of lives.
remember that.
right.
can I help you?
just remember, if anything happens to her, there won't be anywhere in the galaxy you can hide.
is that all?
right.
how is my patient?
she's fine.
very well, let's get started.
don't worry, he's just here as a technical advisor.
I'm going to be performing the surgery.
all right, we're ready.
when are we going to get to see her?
give it some time, just relax.
all right, you can see her now.
how do I look?
now, assume your throne.
are you trying to get us both killed?
I do not understand.
at the first sign of deception, the primary will not hesitate to slit our throats!
you said she would sense my wraith DNA.
it is not your DNA that concerns me.
it is your manner, your bearing.
you project apprehension.
well, given the circumstances
it may be understandable, but it is not acceptable!
above all, you must never show weakness.
now... again!
how long is this going to take, anyway?
until Todd's satisfied she can pass as a wraith queen.
you know, personally, I'm not inclined to rush this thing.
she's already too convincing if you ask me.
creeps me out.
she's still Teyla, underneath all that.
maybe that's the problem.
look, I'm not any crazier about this than you guys, but the fact is, todd's putting his life on the line, too.
I don't think he'd go in there with her if he didn't think she could pull this off.
Where's teyla?
resting.
you'll be pleased to know we've received word back from the primary's hive.
we've been instructed to meet them at their current location.
so, what's the plan?
once we arrive, we make contact with the ship and make our way over.
then Teyla will put forward my proposal.
Oh, your proposal?
believe me, the less the primary knows about my dealings with the humans of Atlantis, the better.
if she doesn't know it's coming from us, what are the chances she's going to buy it?
our alliance has recently been dealt a number of setbacks.
you're getting your asses kicked.
indeed.
although the primary would never admit it out loud, but the one thing stronger than her pride is her instinct for survival.
don't be nervous.
I am not.
so...
at long last we meet.
indeed.
many among my crew were beginning to think you didn't exist.
you must point them out to me, so that I may remove all doubt from their minds.
that will no longer be necessary.
make your way to my ship, and do not keep me waiting again.
she likes you.
you think so?
it was as warm a reception as we could expect.
how'd it go?
apparently, quite well.
they're preparing a shuttle to take me over to the other hive.
you know we can pull the plug anytime you want, you just give us the word.
no.
we've come this far. I intend to go through with this.
well, we'll be right here.
if anything goes wrong, we'll get you out.
but nothing's going to.
well, no, of course not, but I'm just saying, if it does-- - Rodney...
which it won't.
hey...
just be careful over there.
welcome to my ship.
where is your queen?
you will meet her in time.
inform the bridge they're onboard.
take us to hyperspace.
this was not part of the agreement.
you did not expect us to conduct this meeting here, within weapons range of your hive?
we are part of the same alliance.
unless you do not trust us?
I make it a practice to trust no one I do not know.
it is how the queen wishes it.
follow me.
please.
what's going on?
the primary's hive just went into hyperspace.
what?
that wasn't part of the deal.
no, it was not.
Where'd they go?
I do not know.
there is no way to track them. - He's lying.
I assure you, I know nothing of this.
it appears we have no choice but to trust each other.
the queen shall see you shortly.
what have you done?
I swear I did not expect this to happen.
we're in no danger.
if the queen did not believe us, we'd be dead already.
and if she begins to suspect?
we are trapped on this ship.
everything will be fine, provided you continue to play your part.
we must proceed as planned.
what is he doing here?
I thought his presence would be useful, as he is the one you've been dealing with up until now.
I do not like surprises.
nor do I, and yet you are the one who took your ship to hyperspace the moment we stepped aboard.
very well.
come.
let's sit.
what are you doing?
what is the meaning of this?
forgive me, but this is the way it must be.
you must say that you killed her.
are you insane?
this is how it is done with our kind.
this is how power changes hands.
but I do not want-- - listen to me!
the crew will not be happy, but nor will they wish to be without a queen.
you caught her off-guard.
many will perceive that to mean that she was growing weak.
all you need to do is convince them that you are a capable replacement, and they will accept you.
and if I can't?
then we're both dead.
what is this?
I have taken what is rightfully mine.
you killed her!
Yes, and you are the better for it.
you will die for this.
how dare you point a weapon at your queen!
this was my queen!
not anymore.
she no longer had full control over the alliance.
if you can't see that, you're a fool.
did I ask you to speak for me?
no, my queen.
wag your tongue like that again, and I will remove it.
is that understood?
Yes, my queen!
now, drop us out of hyperspace and run a full diagnostic.
I wish to know the state of my new flagship.
and have this... thing removed from my sight.
Yes, my queen.
I have surveyed the crew.
you'll be pleased to know they were entirely fooled.
what were you thinking?
you put both our lives at terrible risk.
I know.
if you'll allow me to explain-- - How could you do this?
it was necessary. The former queen was never going to accept your proposal.
and so you killed her and forced me to take the blame?
if I had taken the blame, I would have been killed, and you would have been held captive.
that was not the desired outcome.
you must understand, our culture is different from your own.
we govern ourselves by different rules.
it was important for you to claim ownership of the act of killing the queen.
you should have informed me of your intention to make me queen of this hive.
perhaps, but I doubt you would have gone through with it had you known.
you're right. It was a foolish, reckless plan.
most wraith seek to be ruled.
they fear being without a queen.
I knew that if you presented yourself as a viable substitute, most of them would just fall in line.
most of them?
the point is, we have achieved what we set out to do.
you are now effectively in control of the alliance.
we may now implement dr. Keller's plan without hindrance.
then there is no further need for us to continue this charade.
take me back to your ship.
soon, but first, you must allow some time for order to be restored, for things to return to normal.
once they do, you may take your leave, and no one on this crew will be the wiser.
I still say this was a setup.
I don't know, Kenny seemed pretty surprised when that ship disappeared.
who?
Kenny, the second-in-command.
well, since when did we start calling him that?
maybe he wasn't in on it.
I don't know, if todd wanted to kidnap Teyla, he would've done it the second we arrived.
it doesn't add up.
seriously, the next time we have to name one of these guys, we should take a vote.
so, what are we going to do?
we can't stay here. We're stuck on a hive surrounded by wraith.
not exactly our strongest position.
all I've got is a jumper. Where do you want to go?
well, we get to a gate, we gate back to atlantis, and then we figure out where they took teyla.
how, exactly?
okay, so I haven't quite worked out the details yet, but...
we have something.
the primary's hive has dropped out of hyperspace.
how do you know?
we're receiving a signal.
it's Todd's subspace transmitter.
they're in empty space, on the edge of a large nebula.
what are they doing out there?
who cares? This is our chance. Let's go after them.
I've already plotted the course, but you should know that it will arouse suspicion for us to arrive unannounced.
well, let's worry about that later.
for now, this is the closest thing they've got to a distress signal.
I'm sorry to disturb you, my queen.
we've received an urgent report.
you intend to make her read it?
a hive belonging to another alliance has been detected above one of our feeding grounds not far from here.
have you tried to contact them?
they are not responding.
dispatch the closest hive to investigate.
we are the closest hive.
it falls upon us to intercept.
we must remain here.
my queen, perhaps we should discuss this in private.
leave us.
we must respond to this.
to do otherwise will read as weakness.
the crew will not understand.
then let them be confused.
spoken like a true queen, but you risk breeding suspicion.
for the moment, they believe you, and are prepared to serve you but if you break that trust by making irrational decisions, they will quickly fall away from you.
what about your ship?
it is probably already on its way.
they will pick up on our new location as soon as they arrive.
inform the bridge to set a course.
now, Kenny's right about one thing
the second we drop out of hyperspace, the primary's hive ship's going to know something's up.
we drop out early, go the rest of the way by jumper.
that's going to take too long. We need a diversion.
so, what... what kind of a diversion?
you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah, but I don't think we can rely on Kenny to give the order, though.
we don't give him a choice.
what are you talking about? What order?
Oh, no, wait a minute. You're not thinking about attacking the other ship?
look, it's the only way to keep them occupied long enough to get on board, get Teyla, and get back.
but it's also incredibly risky. I mean, either of the ships could be destroyed.
well, we'll just make sure we get her out of there before that happens.
look, I realize the odds aren't exactly in our favor, Rodney, but the longer we wait to get teyla, the more likely it is we never will.
we just have to keep all of our options open.
we have reached the feeding ground.
they will attempt to negotiate a concession, but you must stand firm.
they may even threaten to attack, but they will not want to fight any more than we do.
the other hive is trying to contact us.
ignore them. Charge weapons.
you wish to attack unprovoked?
we were provoked.
they have encroached upon our territory.
I want them destroyed.
now!
what are you doing?
what does it look like?
I told you to talk to them.
you also told me to show no weakness.
they're returning fire.
we're taking hull damage.
deploy the darts.
under these conditions, they will suffer heavy losses.
I'm fully aware of the costs, but we must take a firm stance against intrusions such as this.
to kill wraith.
half the first wave has been destroyed.
but the survivors are now too close to be affected by the ship's weapons, and they can attack at will.
until the enemy launches their own darts to intercept.
that will take time.
with any luck, we've caught them off guard.
they're not here.
where the hell are they?
they've moved, to one of our more populated feeding grounds.
what for?
I do not know.
I'm not on the ship.
but if I had to guess, I would say they've gone to cull.
what now?
what else can we do? We go after them.
if they jump into hyperspace, we're going to lose them again, right?
pretty much. Todd's locator beacon doesn't work in hyperspace.
we got to stop playing catch-up.
is there a stargate on that planet?
of course.
then drop us off. We can get there faster in the jumper.
how do you intend to get on board their ship?
don't worry about it. Just get us to the nearest stargate.
my queen, our darts are outnumbered two to one.
if we do not recall them now, they will be wiped out.
and their sacrifice will be remembered when this alliance rules the galaxy.
what was that?
keep firing all other batteries.
all right, we should be coming up on them now.
wait a minute, there's two of them.
they're not pulling any punches, either.
still picking up that signal?
Yeah.
all right, it's that one.
they're not doing so good.
what do you mean?
they must've lost some of their weapons.
I mean, they're seriously outgunned.
we got to do something.
you know, just last week I was talking to Zelenka about trying to reverse-engineer a daedalus beaming system for the jumpers.
And?
Oh, well, no, we're nowhere near close.
I mean, the asgard technology's incredibly complicated
what the hell are you bringing this up for now?
I'm just saying that this would be the perfect situation for something like...
all right, everybody hold on. We're going in.
what are you doing?
trying to tip the scales a little.
are you nuts? They can see us!
think that did it?
we're about to find out.
that's impossible.
the enemy hive just exploded.
well done, my queen.
perhaps next time, you will not be so quick to question my tactics.
recall the darts.
darts are heading back. Bay doors are open.
all right, that's our cue. I'm going in.
where do we go?
I don't know.
what do you mean, you don't know? - It's hard to tell.
I think we're on the wrong level.
Plus, the signal keeps moving around.
that's a good sign Todd's alive.
still doesn't tell us anything about teyla.
all right.
it's this way. I think.
we're going to have to circle back.
Oh, great, I got to figure this out all over again?
another patrol coming this way. - So, what are we going to do?
we got no choice.
let's move. - Which way?
I guess that answers that.
inform the queen.
we have intruders.
now what?
well, if i had to guess,
I'd say we'll be taken in front of the queen, who will demand answers and threaten to feed on us.
at which time, I hope to have plan to get us out of here.
very reassuring.
it's Teyla. She's alive.
Rodney, quiet.
leave us.
John, Ronon, Rodney, it is good to see you, but you should not have come for me.
Why? What's going on?
I'll explain later, but you must not attempt to escape.
you're in no danger.
I'm now queen of this hive.
wait, what?
it is a long story.
no, we got a jumper here, we can leave right now.
no, I must solidify my position first.
it is the only chance we have to ensure the alliance will accept the treatment.
otherwise, this will all have been for nothing.
all right.
we'll let it play out. For now.
my queen...
what are you doing here?
who authorized you to wait in my quarters?
I let myself in.
I needed to see you in private.
I do not wish to speak right now. Come back later.
I am your queen. I command you. - You are not my queen.
how dare you speak to me like this.
remove yourself from my sight immediately.
I saw you talking with the prisoners from atlantis.
And?
I may not interrogate prisoners on my own ship?
Oh, you may, though it is odd that you refer to them as prisoners.
I overheard what you said to them.
you knew them, and they knew you, and I asked myself "how is such a thing possible?
I suspected you right from the moment you set foot upon my ship, and against my better judgment
I allowed you to remain onboard while you committed treachery after treachery.
it was my duty to defend the ship, and I failed.
I'm afraid your reign is over, my queen.
he'll not be bothering you any further.
thank you.
my hive arrived moments ago.
I've arranged for colonel sheppard, ronon, and dr. Mckay to be transferred there immediately.
good. When do I join them?
as soon as this is all over.
I am leaving behind my trusted commander.
let me be clear, you will still fall under my protection, but in my absence, you will heed his every order as if it were my own.
when he speaks, it is as though I am speaking through him.
is that understood?
Yes, my queen.
good.
then it is time.
escort me to my transport.
the queen departs.
well done.
I believe you've managed to allay all suspicions.
just remember why we did this, to disseminate dr. Keller's treatment to as many wraith as possible.
of course.
although I think it might be wise to let matters settle for a time first.
how much time?
not long.
you're not planning on going back on our agreement, are you?
no, no.
I'm just saying that to press such a radical agenda so soon after the change in leadership...
well, it may invite unwelcome questions.
fine.
very well
but bear in mind that as far as this crew is concerned,
I am still their queen.
Oh, yes.
I will be watching you, and should you step out of line, I will not hesitate to make a reappearance and have you removed.
very well.
permanently.
what have you done to her, doc?
very funny.
how you feeling?
better.
still some soreness, but for the most part, it's gone.
good.
well, I have rounds, but I'll come and check on you later.
make sure he doesn't give you a hard time.
sure you're feeling okay?
Yes. Thank you.
no lingering desires to feed on anything?
only on solid food.
the blended concoctions given to me by Dr. Keller are not very satisfying.
well, it's only been two weeks. Give it some time.
look, um...
I haven't had the chance to tell you that what you did, uh, took...
you know, a lot of guts.
I'm just glad it worked out for the best.
has there been any further word from Todd?
not really. We're supposed to meet with him in a few weeks about this whole gene therapy thing.
word has it he's solidified his position as, uh, "leader" of the alliance.
what?
do you not find it strange that as a result of all of this, todd now personally has control of that entire alliance?
you think that was his plan all along, huh?
the thought had crossed my mind.
Yeah.
regardless, I think we're better off than we were before.
Yes.
I suppose you're right.
get some rest.
I'll come back and check on you.
you HAVE SOME WRAITH DNA.
she CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING?
I AM ON A SHIP.
receiving AN IVC.
who IS IT?
stargate COMMAND.
all WE HAVE TO DO IS HOLD OUT UNTIL THE DAEDALUS GETS HERE.
then WE CAN USE THE ZPM TO POWER THE CITY SHIELD.
multiple SIGNALS, SIR.
we COULDN'T SEE THEM UNTIL THEY WERE RIGHT ON TOP OF US.
Colonel MARSHALL SUMNER WAS A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.
you ADMIT TO FIRING THE SHOT THAT KILLED HIM.
the WRAITH.
they ARE IN ATLANTIS.
they're SENDING IN ANOTHER WAVE.
fly THE PUDDLE JUMPER IN STEALTH MODE RIGHT DOWN THEIR THROATS.
are YOU VOLUNTEERING FOR A SUICIDE MISSION?
you CAN'T.
I HAVE TO, AND YOU KNOW IT.
Teyla, I'M HEARING GUNFIRE. WHAT'S YOUR STATUS?
weapon IS ARMED AND READY.
I'm GOING IN.
and NOW THE CONCLUSION.
defense!
major SHEPPARD, DE-CLOAK YOUR JUMPER IMMEDIATELY.
what?
who THE HELL IS THIS?
authentication ALPHA-CHARLIE-ONE. DE-CLOAK NOW.
detonation IN...
the TARGET HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED.
he DID IT.
he DID.
Dr. WEIR, I'M PICKING UP ANOTHER SHIP.
another HIVE SHIP?
negative. I'M READING I. F.F.
Atlantis, THIS IS SHEPPARD.
what OTHER SHEPPARDS DO YOU KNOW?
Oh, THANK GOD.
it CAN'T BE. WE SAW THE HIVE SHIP GO UP.
I ASSURE YOU, DR. McKAY,
that MAJOR SHEPPARD IS ALIVE AND WELL.
who IS THIS?
Colonel STEVEN CALDWELL, COMMANDER OF THE DAEDALUS.
we ARE READY TO ASSIST YOU.
Oh, THANK YOU.
well, WE ARE VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT, COLONEL...
and I ASSUME WE HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR SAVING MAJOR SHEPPARD.
we WERE MONITORING YOUR TRANSMISSIONS AS SOON AS WE CAME OUT OF HYPERSPACE, BUT WE COULDN'T BEAM HIM IN UNTIL HE DE-CLOAKED HIS JUMPER.
didn't TAKE MUCH CONVINCING.
Dr. McKAY?
present. YES.
I TRUST YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS.
your ZPM, SIR.
how DID THEY DO THAT?
the DAED ALUS IS LOADED WITH ASGARD TECHNOLOGY.
the BEAMING TECHNOLOGY'S THE FIRST PART OF IT.
they've GOT-- - RODNEY...
what SAY WE GET THE SHIELDS BACK UP?
what SAY WE.
we STILL HAVE WRAITH ALL OVER THE CITY.
after WE DEAL WITH THIS OTHER HIVE SHIP, WE'LL ASSIST YOU AS SOON AS WE CAN.
Caldwell OUT.
sir, WE HAVE INCOMING ENEMY FIGHTERS BEARING THREE-TWO-ZERO.
all FORWARD RAIL GUNS STAND BY.
Timer: fisherchen
Colonel CALDWELL?
this IS NOVAK IN ENGINEERING.
what IS IT?
HERMIOD WANTED TO REMIND YOU THAT OUR SHIELD STRENGTH WILL BE SEVERELY DIMINISHED WITHOUTTHE ZERO POINT MODULE TIED INTO OUR POWER SYSTEMS.
I'm WELL AWARE OF THAT, DOCTOR. CALDWELL OUT.
major, DO YOU RECOMMEND ANY SPECIFIC TARGET ON THE HIVE SHIP?
one OF THE FIGHTER BAYS, SIR.
it WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SECONDARY EXPLOSIONS.
that WAS THE THINKING, SIR.
I AGREE. ARM TWO MARK VIII TACTICALS.
our TARGET IS THE HIVE SHIP'S MAIN FIGHTER BAY.
warheads ARMED. TARGET IS LOCKED, SIR.
fire.
they DIDN'T EVEN GET CLOSE.
pilot, ALTER HEADING TO INTERCEPT.
go TO MAX THRUST.
Max THRUST.
we'll JUST HAVE TO GET CLOSER.
the ASGARD GAVE YOU HYPERDRIVES AND SHIELDS.
how COME NO OFFENSIVE WEAPONS?
they DON'T LIKE PROVIDING OTHER RACES WITH ANYTHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED AGAINST THEM.
I THOUGHT THEY WERE ALLIES.
without THEIR BEAMING TECHNOLOGY, YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE, MAJOR.
arm TWO MORE MARK VIIIs.
you're WASTING ORDNANCE, COLONEL.
those MISSILES ARE BEING INTERCEPTED MILES FROM THE HIVE SHIP.
I BROUGHT UP THE SHIELD SUBROUTINE.
when I GIVE THE WORD, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUNCH IN
Yes, I KNOW WHAT TO DO. GO.
what IS THIS? THIS IS MY SECURITY ESCORT?
well, WE ARE SPREAD A LITTLE BIT THIN RIGHT NOW.
okay, WELL, YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT IF WE COME UNDER FIRE, YOU'LL HAVE TO PUT YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE TO PROTECT ME.
Rodney! - OKAY-- I MEAN, THE ZPM.
you NEED TO PROTECT THE ZPM AT ALL COSTS...AND ME.
am I WRONG?
Dr. WEIR? - YES?
I've LOST CONTACT WITH SOME OF OUR PEOPLE.
who?
I CAN'T GET AHOLD OF THE TEAMS LED BY CAPTAIN RADNER, TEYLA, OR LIEUTENANT FORD.
well, KEEP TRYING.
okay, NOW WE'RE OH-FOR-TWO.
how MANY OF THESE THINGS HAVE YOU GOT?
only ONE NEEDS TO GET THROUGH.
is THERE ANY WAY WE CAN DELIVER A WARHEAD THE SAME WAY YOU PLUCKED ME OUT OF THE JUMPER?
the ASGARD HAVE ALREADY CONSIDERED THAT, MAJOR.
there ARE FAILSAFES BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM TO PREVENT THEIR USE AS A WEAPONS DELIVERY SYSTEM.
you've GOT ONE OF THESE ASGARD ON BOARD.
can HE OVERRIDE THE FAILSAFE?
why WOULD HE DO THAT?
his BUTT'S ON THE LINE JUST AS MUCH AS OURS.
Novak, I NEED YOU AND HERMIOD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET A SITE-TO-SITE TRANSPORT LOCK ON A SET OF COORDINATES INSIDE THE HIVE SHIP.
no, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
sir, UH, HERMIOD ISN'T GOING TO LIKE THAT.
get IT DONE, DOCTOR. THAT'S AN ORDER.
that's WHERE WE HAVE TO GO.
what's THAT? I DIDN'T GET ALL THAT.
what DO I DO?
look, I'M GETTING GOOD AT THE ROLL-Y THINGS.
maybe I CAN CLEAR.
no. YOU STAY HERE.
what?
so...
this IS HOW IT'S GOING TO BE, HUH?
just ME?
okay, THAT'S FINE!
you WANT SOME OF THIS? HUH?
huh?
this IS McKAY! I'M IN TROUBLE DOWN HERE!
Dr. McKAY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
Teyla. WE THOUGHT...
my RADIO IS BROKEN
and I WAS SEPARATED FROM MY GROUP.
I've BEEN TRYING TO MAKE MY WAY BACK.
well, THANK GOD. I MEAN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
I THOUGHT I WAS-- I THOUGHT - YOU WERE VERY BRAVE.
Really?
Oh. I HAVE A ZPM.
Yes.
we NEED TO GET THE SHIELDS UP.
lead THE WAY.
sure. UH, AFTER YOU.
I've SET THE TIMER FOR FIVE SECONDS.
is THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU?
five SECONDS SHOULD BE MORE THAN AMPLE.
okay, LOOK...
I KNOW YOU DON'T APPROVE OF USING TECHNOLOGY THIS WAY, BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND...
I AM READY.
Colonel, HERMIOD IS READY
and STANDING BY FOR WARHEAD TRANSPORT, BUT I CAN TELL YOU HE IS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS.
I'll TAKE THAT UNDER ADVISEMENT.
are WE WITHIN TRANSPORT RANGE?
Yes, SIR.
transport WARHEAD WHEN READY.
ready.
the WEAPON IS AWAY.
we HAVE A KILL.
the LAST HIVE SHIP HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED.
Novak, I NEED YOU TO PREP ANOTHER WARHEAD FOR TRANSPORT.
we NEED TO TAKE OUT THOSE CRUISERS.
sir, WAIT.
Colonel, CRUISERS HAVE BROKEN OFF AND ENTERED HYPERSPACE.
after SEEING WHAT WE JUST DID TO THEIR REMAINING HIVE SHIPS, I DON'T BLAME THEM.
there's STILL A LOT OF DARTS OUT THERE.
all RIGHT, LET'S CLEAN THIS UP.
sir, THE WRAITH FIGHTERS ARE REGROUPING.
all RAIL GUN POSITIONS STAND BY FOR DEFENSIVE FIRE.
we're NOT THE TARGET.
major SHEPPARD IS RIGHT, SIR.
the FORMATION IS HEADED TOWARD ATLANTIS.
Elizabeth, YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM.
Yeah, WE SEE THAT, MAJOR.
we're MOVING TO INTERCEPT
I DON'T THINK WE CAN GET THERE IN TIME.
not A CHANCE. THEY'RE COMING IN TOO FAST.
Oh, MY GOD. THEIR APPROACH IS BALLISTIC.
what EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN?
their IMPACT VELOCITIES WILL BE IN EXCESS OF 10, 000 KILOMETERS AN HOUR.
no PART OF THE CITY CAN WITHSTAND THAT.
you BETTER GET THE DAMN SHIELD UP.
how MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?
45 SECONDS.
Rodney, WE NEED THE SHIELD UP IN 40 SECONDS OR WE'RE DEAD.
what, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
no. BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO DETERMINE THE POINT AT WHICH I COMPLETELY SNAP.
that SHOULD DO IT.
fire IT UP.
that DIDN'T DO IT.
what? - IT IS NOT WORKING.
I KNOW WHAT SHE SAID.
20 SECONDS.
okay. SNAP! THAT'S IT!
you ALL HAPPY NOW?
go.
okay, OKAY, OKAY.
try IT NOW!
Yes.
Atlantis, THIS IS SHEPPARD. COME IN.
Atlantis.
I REPEAT...
this IS SHEPPARD. WHAT IS YOUR STATUS?
the EXPLOSIONS MUST HAVE DISRUPTED THE RADIO SIGNALS.
we're STILL HERE.
that's OUR STATUS.
don't SCARE ME LIKE THAT.
sorry.
what ABOUT THE WRAITH FLEET?
the REMAINING CRUISERS HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE BATTLE.
thank YOU, COLONEL.
thank ALL OF YOU.
glad TO BE OF HELP.
we're GOING TO STAY IN GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT FOR THE TIME BEING.
can WE BE OF ANY FURTHER ASSISTANCE?
we COULD USE SOME HELP WITH THE WRAITH IN THE CITY.
I'll SEND SOME PEOPLE TO HELP WITH THAT OUT.
major SHEPPARD, I'M SURE YOU'RE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK TO ATLANTIS.
Yes, SIR.
thank YOU.
the REST OF THE DAY OFF.
I'm GOING TO CURL UP IN BED WITH THE LARGEST SANDWICH I CAN FIND.
shall I JUST EXPLAIN TO THE REST OF THE WRAITH LEFT ON THE BASE THAT YOU ARE UNAVAILABLE TO FIGHT?
secure STARGATE OPERATIONS.
well, I'M HOME.
Yes, YOU ARE.
I TRULY THOUGHT YOU
Yeah, YEAH, I THOUGHT THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU A MINUTE AGO.
we've GOT TO STOP THAT.
I'd LIKE THAT.
so WHERE ARE WE?
well, MOST OF OUR SENSORS ARE STILL DOWN, BUT WE DO KNOW THERE ARE AT LEAST A HANDFUL OF WRAITH STILL IN THE CITY.
I've STILL GOT SOME WORK TO DO.
before YOU DO ANYTHING, COLONEL EVERETT INSISTS ON SPEAKING WITH YOU.
he's IN THE INFIRMARY.
we've NEUTRALIZED THE HIVE SHIPS, ACTIVATED THE SHIELDS, AND WE'VE MUSTERED AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN, MAKING SURE THERE'S NO WRAITH HIDING IN THE SHADOWS.
good WORK, MAJOR.
thank YOU, SIR.
they're SHIPPING ME OUT WITH THE NEXT BATCH OF WOUNDED.
I WANTED TO FINISH OUR CONVERSATION.
Yes, SIR.
I...OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.
no, SIR, YOU DON'T.
I THINK I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA...
I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING AS YOU DID WHEN YOU FOUND COLONEL SUMNER.
that's WHAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU.
well, NONE OF THAT MATTERS RIGHT NOW, SIR.
I'm TRYING TO SAY...I WISH YOU HAD BEEN THERE FOR ME.
you're GOING TO BE FINE, SIR.
once YOU GET BACK TO EARTH
I SAID WHAT I HAD TO SAY.
get BACK TO WORK.
Yes, SIR.
the PRELIMINARY COUNT IS 40 CASUALTIES, MAYBE MORE.
I'm STILL TRYING TO LINE UP
life SIGN READINGS WITH ACTUAL PEOPLE.
there ARE NO WRAITH LIFE SIGNS?
the LAST ONE WAS TRAPPED IN ONE OF THE DEEPER PARTS OF THE CITY.
he DIED TRYING TO DAMAGE THE CITY WITH ONE OF THEIR GRENADES.
three OF OUR MEN WERE INJURED.
on THE BRIGHT SIDE, THERE WAS NO FLOODING.
have WE BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE LIEUTENANT FORD YET?
I'm SORRY. NO.
we've SEARCHED EVERYWHERE IN THE CITY.
it's POSSIBLE HE MAY HAVE BEAMED UP INTO ONE OF THE WRAITH DARTS.
let's NOT MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION.
major, I'M SORRY.
we've SEARCHED EVERYWHERE IN THE CITY
well, HOW ABOUT OUTSIDE THE CITY?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
well, EXPAND THE SENSORS. MAYBE HE'S IN THE WATER.
even IF THAT WAS THE CASE
look, I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO SWIM OUT THERE.
I'm ASKING YOU TO PRESS A FEW DAMN BUTTONS.
even IF YOU'RE RIGHT, I DON'T SEE HOW
Oh, MY GOD.
Colonel CALDWELL, ONE OF OUR MEN IS IN THE OCEAN OUTSIDE OUR SHIELD, MOST PROBABLY INJURED.
can YOU BEAM HIM TO YOUR SHIP, THEN DOWN TO OUR INFIRMARY?
Atlantis?
this IS DR. NOVAK ON THE DAEDALUS.
you're GOING TO NEED SOME S. O.s IN YOUR INFIRMARY
before WE BEAM YOUR MAN DOWN.
we ALREADY DO, DOCTOR. BEAM AWAY.
good LORD.
let's GET THIS THING OFF OF HIM.
how IS HE?
I GAVE HIM A MILD SEDATIVE TO HELP HIM REST, BUT HE SHOULD BE DEAD.
well, HE'S A TOUGH KID.
not MY POINT, MAJOR.
he WAS LAYING FACE DOWN IN THE FREEZING WATER FOR OVER AN HOUR.
I DON'T CARE HOW TOUGH HE IS.
so, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
we STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT WORKS, BUT DURING THE WRAITH FEEDING PROCESS, THE VICTIM IS INJECTED WITH A SPECIAL ENZYME.
it STRENGTHENS THE HUMAN BODY TEMPORARILY AND ENSURES THAT THE HEART CONTINUES TO BEAT.
why WOULD THEY WANT TO MAKE YOU STRONGER?
so THE VICTIM DOESN'T DIE IMMEDIATELY.
the FEEDING PROCESS IS SO TRAUMATIC, WITHOUT THIS SPECIAL ENZYME, WE'D SHUT DOWN FAR SOONER THAN THEY LIKE.
they MAKE YOU STRONGERSO THEY CAN TAKE MORE TIME TO KILL YOU.
lovely, ISN'T IT?
in MOST CASES, THE ENZYME IS RELEASED SLOWLY INTO THE BLOOD STREAM THROUGHOUT THE FEEDING PROCESS.
I CAN ONLY ASCERTAIN THAT THE WRAITH DIED QUITE SUDDENLY, AND THAT LIEUTENANT FORD'S SYSTEM BECAME FLOODED WITH IT.
and THAT'S WHY HE WAS ABLE TO SURVIVE IN THE WATER FOR SO LONG.
exactly.
the PROBLEM IS NOW THE ENZYME IS BREAKING DOWN IN HIS SYSTEM.
eventually THERE'LL BE NONE LEFT.
that's NOT GOOD.
no. IN FACT, I'M QUITE CERTAIN IT WILL KILL HIM.
it's POSSIBLE HIS BODY'S BECOME DEPENDENT ON THE ENZYME TO FUNCTION.
what's THE TREATMENT?
we WEAN HIM OFF IT, SNEAK HIS BODY CHEMISTRY BACK TO NORMAL INCREMENTALLY.
then WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET MORE OF THIS ENZYME.
Aye.
with YOUR PERMISSION, DOCTOR, I'D LIKE TO HARVEST IT FROM THE WRAITH BODIES IN THE MORGUE.
I KNOW IT'S A WEE BIT CREEPY, BUT
Elizabeth. MAJOR SHEPPARD.
do WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO.
what IS IT?
you're GOING TO WANT TO GET UP HERE.
aren't YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
I WAS TRYING TO DO JUST THAT, BUT SOMEONE THOUGHT I SHOULD KNOW THE DEEP SPACE SENSORS WERE BACK UP AND RUNNING.
Yes, AND?
we've PICKED UP 12 MORE HIVE SHIPS TRAVELING IN HYPERSPACE.
their COURSE AND SPEED WILL BRING THEM HERE IN...36 HOURS.
12 HIVE SHIPS?
the CRUISERS THAT GOT AWAY PROBABLY CALLED FOR REINFORCEMENTS.
our RESEARCH SHOWS THERE ARE AT LEAST 60 HIVE SHIPS IN THIS GALAXY.
who KNOWS HOW MANY MORE COULD BE ON THE WAY.
at LEAST THE SHIELD'S UP AND RUNNING.
that ONLY BUYS US TIME.
I LIKE TIME.
the FIRST SIEGE OF ATLANTIS LASTED FOR YEARS.
I MEAN, WITH ONLY ONE FUNCTIONING ZPM, WE CAN'T EXPECT TO HOLD ON THAT LONG.
can WE SUBMERGE THE CITY AGAIN?
it's A CITY, NOT A YO-YO.
look, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THEY DID IT THE FIRST TIME.
how LONG UNTIL THEY ARRIVE?
a LITTLE OVER A DAY.
you KNOW WHAT?
I'm SICK OF THIS.
I'm SORRY?
I MEAN SITTING AROUND WAITING FOR THEM TO SHOW UP.
I SAY WE TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM.
we've GOT ONE SHIP, MAJOR.
one SHIP WITH AN ASGARD SHIELD, AN ARMORY FULL OF NUKES, AND BEAMING TECHNOLOGY.
that EVENS THE ODDS A HELL OF A LOT.
12 HIVE SHIPS AND THEIR ESCORTS.
I'm TELLING YOU, WE'VE GOT TO SEND THESE GUYS A MESSAGE.
we're NOT LIKE THE ANCIENTS.
we're NOT GOING TO SIT AROUND AND WAIT.
if THEY DON'T BACK OFF, WE HAVE THE CAPACITY AND THE WILL TO GO KICK THEIR ASSES FOR A CHANGE.
how DO I FIGHT A SHIP IN HYPERSPACE?
the WRAITH'S FASTER-THAN-LIGHT TRAVEL IS NOT AS EFFICIENT AS THE ASGARD HYPERDRIVE ABOARD THE DAEDALUS.
not ONLY ARE THEY SLOWER, THEY NEED TO TRAVEL IN A SERIES OF JUMPS, SO IF MY CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT, THEY'LL MAKE ONE LAST STOP HERE, 50 LIGHT YEARS AWAY, BEFORE THEY MAKE THE FINAL JUMP TO ATLANTIS.
Dr. WEIR?
it WILL FEEL GOOD TO HAVE THEM ON THE DEFENSIVE FOR A CHANGE.
all RIGHT, THEN.
let's DO THIS.
scanners ARE CLEAR, SIR.
no CONTACTS.
I HOPE WE'RE IN THE RIGHT SPOT.
they'll BE HERE.
I've LEARNED TO TRUST RODNEY ABOUT THESE THINGS.
I've SET THE WARHEADS TO GO OFF ONE SECOND AFTER REINTEGRATION.
so I ASSUME YOU'RE FINE WITH THAT?
okay.
they ARE ANGRY.
I CAN FEEL IT.
word OF OUR SUCCESS MIGHT SPREAD TO OTHER WORLDS.
they WANT US SILENCED.
you CAN SENSE THAT?
the WRAITH WARRIORS WERE IN SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY...
excuse ME.
I'd LIKE TO REPORT FOR DUTY, MA'AM.
Dr. BECKETT RELEASED YOU?
why WOULDN'T HE? I'M FINE.
if WE CAN HIT THE FIRST ONE OR TWO AS SOON AS THEY EXIT HYPERSPACE, I THINK THAT'LL SEND A MESSAGE.
who KNOWS? MAYBE THEY'LL SURRENDER.
sir, WE HAVE A CONTACT.
standby FOR WEAPONS DEPLOYMENT.
shields AT MAX POWER.
shields UP.
Novak, THIS IS CALDWELL.
begin DEPLOYMENT AT YOUR DISCRETION.
I HAVE A WEAPONS' LOCK ON THE COORDINATES
of THE FIRST ENEMY VESSEL.
got IT.
first WEAPON AWAY, COLONEL.
that's A KILL.
stand BY.
all RIGHT, THAT'S TWO.
it's WORKING.
stand BY FOR COORDINATES.
the OTHER HIVE SHIPS ARE ALTERING COURSE TO INTERCEPT.
take US RIGHT AT THEM.
Yes, SIR.
they're FLANKING US.
forward RAIL GUNS RETURN FIRE.
we NEED TO SPEED UP DEPLOYMENT OF THOSE NUKES, OR THIS FIGHT IS GOING TO BE OVER SOON.
the ENEMY HAS ENGAGED COUNTERMEASURES THAT ARE PREVENTING OUR ABILITY TO TRANSPORT.
is THERE A WAY TO COUNTER THE COUNTERMEASURES?
none.
Colonel, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
they've FOUND A WAY TO JAM US
from BEAMING ONTO THEIR SHIPS.
we DON'T KNOW HOW.
rear SHIELD EMITTERS ARE DOWN TO 40%!
ventral RAIL GUN TWO IS OUT OF ACTION!
bring SUBSPACE ENGINES TO MAX THRUST.
Yes, SIR.
try KEEPING THE DAMAGED SHIELD FROM THEIR MAIN FORCE.
sir, ONE OF THE CRUISERS IS APPROACHING ON A PARALLEL COURSE.
they MAY INTEND TO BOARD US.
that WAS THEIR STRATEGY WHEN THEY ATTACKED ATLANTIS.
shield STATUS.
under 20%.
set COURSE FOR ATLANTIS AND ENGAGE HYPERDRIVE.
hyperdrive. YES, SIR.
bottom LINE IS IT DIDN'T WORK.
at LEAST YOU GAVE THEM SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.
we'll SEE.
I DOUBT VERY MUCH IF THAT TACTIC WILL WORK AGAIN, AND THE DAEDALUS HAS SUSTAINED DAMAGE.
it WAS STILL THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
we SHOULD MAKE IT HOME BEFORE THEY DO.
I HOPE SO.
we'll KEEP THE PORCH LIGHT ON FOR YOU.
okay, WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? - OH, LET ME SEE.
we've GOT SLOW DEATH, QUICK DEATH, PAINFUL DEATH, COLD, LONELY DEATH...
okay, YOU SAID YOURSELF THAT THE SHIELD...SHOULD BUY US SOME TIME...WHERE DO YOU WANT ME?
lieutenant, I
lieutenant, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING HERE?
I'm FINE, DOC, REALLY. IT'S COOL.
the HELL YOU ARE. YOU SHOULD BE BACK IN BED.
I FEEL GREAT. JUST DROP IT.
I WILL NOT "JUST DROP IT.
not 20 MINUTES AGO, YOU WERE AT DEATH'S DOOR.
I DON'T CARE HOW SPRY YOU'RE FEELING.
you NEED TO BE UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION.
I'm GOOD TO GO.
I APPRECIATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM, LIEUTENANT, BUT
I'm SERIOUS. JUST LET ME PROVE IT.
just GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO.
I DON'T THINK SO
don't PUSH ME AROUND!
lieutenant...
put HIM DOWN, AIDEN.
he's TRYING TO HELP YOU.
I'm SORRY, DOC.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I
you NEED TO BE UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION.
he's RIGHT, LIEUTENANT.
we JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY
you're SUDDENLY FEELING THIS WAY.
okay.
I'll GO BACK.
good.
that's WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.
Yes, MA'AM.
sedate HIM IF YOU HAVE TO.
Aye.
it's STARTING TO AFFECT HIS BRAIN CHEMISTRY.
there's NO WAY YOU COULD HAVE KNOWN THAT, CARSON,
and IT'S BETTER THIS THAN DEAD.
we NEED TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE,
wean HIM OFF IT QUICKER THAN I EXPECTED TO.
it'll BE PAINFUL AND ARDUOUS, BUT I THINK IT MAY BE THE ONLY OPTION.
I've SEDATED HIM, BUT HE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE UNDER SECURE SUPERVISION.
I've ALREADY STATIONED A GUARD AT THE DOOR.
Dr. WEIR, THE DAEDALUS IS REQUESTING PERMISSION TO LAND ON THE EAST PIER.
permission GRANTED. I'LL MEET THEM THERE.
welcome BACK TO ATLANTIS, COLONEL.
the WRAITH ARE RIGHT BEHIND US.
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU TO LAND.
until REPAIRS ARE COMPLETE, THE DAEDALUS IS GOING TO NEED ATLANTIS' SHIELDS AS MUCH AS YOU DO.
Dr. WEIR, THE HIVE SHIPS ARE EMERGING FROM HYPERSPACE.
we're ON OUR WAY.
don't MOVE OR I'LL SHOOT HIM.
Where's THE REST OF THE ENZYME?
there IS NO MORE.
I SAW YOU EXTRACT IT. DON'T LIE TO ME.
where IS IT? - NO, I'M NOT LYING
where IS IT?
you're NOT THINKING STRAIGHT, SON.
you're ALL AFRAID OF ME.
look AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO BE.
I'm GOING TO DIE IF I DON'T GET IT.
Aiden, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE
shut UP!
I'm NOT GOING TO ASK AGAIN.
is THAT ALL OF IT?
I PROMISE YOU.
toss IT OVER.
toss IT.
don't FOLLOW ME.
they're GETTING INTO SOME SORT OF FORMATION.
move, MOVE.
the SHIELD'S HOLDING UNDER THE BOMBARDMENT,
but IT'S UNDER INCREDIBLE STRAIN.
how LONG WILL IT HOLD?
if THEY'D STOP FIRING AT IT, IT'D LAST ALMOST INDEFINITELY, - BUT WITH THIS KIND OF-- - ARE WE TALKING MONTHS? WEEKS?
days.
at THIS RATE, THE ZPM WILL BE DEPLETED WITHIN DAYS.
it's ALMOST PRETTY, ISN'T IT?
almost. NOT QUITE.
we CAN GET THE DAEDALUS BACK INTO FIGHTING FORM WITHIN 24 HOURS, BUT I THINK THE NEXT ENGAGEMENT'S GOING TO HAVE THE SAME RESULT.
even IF WE WERE ABLE TO DESTROY THESE SHIPS THIS INSTANT, MORE WOULD BE HERE IN A FEW DAYS, AND EVEN MORE A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT.
from WHERE I'M STANDING, I JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN WIN THIS.
well, NOW WE KNOW HOW THE ANCIENTS MUST HAVE FELT.
Atlantis IS THE ONLY WAY TO EARTH.
as LONG AS THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE,
they're JUST GOING TO KEEP COMING.
as LONG AS THEY KNOW THAT WE'RE HERE.
what DO YOU MEAN?
Zelenka JUST SAID, "AS LONG AS THEY KNOW THAT WE'RE HERE, THEY'LL KEEP COMING."
Yes, HE SAID THAT.
what IF THEY THOUGHT WE WERE GONE?
then THERE'D BE NO REASON FOR THEM TO STAY.
exactly.
exactly WHAT?
we DISAPPEAR.
destroy THE CITY, YOU MEAN?
no, WE JUST MAKE IT LOOK LIKE WE DID.
how?
we CLOAK IT.
Yes. YES.
the PUDDLE JUMPERS ARE EQUIPPED WITH CLOAKING TECHNOLOGY, WHICH RENDERS THEM INVISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE AND TO WRAITH SCANS.
if WE JUST SIMPLY REMOVE ONE OF THE CLOAK GENERATORS FROM THE PUDDLE JUMPER I WOULDN'T SAY "SIMPLY," BUT YES, BY INTERFACING A JUMPER'S STEALTH MODE GENERATOR WITH THE CITY SHIELD, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RENDER THE CITY INVISIBLE.
that's ALL WELL AND GOOD, BUT I THINK IF THE CITY WERE TO SUDDENLY DISAPPEAR, THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT ONE AND ONE TOGETHER.
which IS WHY WE FAKE A SELF-DESTRUCT.
have THE DAEDALUS BEAM A NUKE RIGHT ABOVE THE CITY SHIELD AND THEN DETONATE IT.
while THEIR SENSORS ARE BLINDED,
we CLOAK THE CITY.
when THE SMOKE CLEARS...
nothing BUT OCEAN.
what ABOUT HARD RADIATION?
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CALCULATE WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY HOW LONG TO WAIT BEFORE WE SWITCH OVER TO THE CLOAK.
what ABOUT THE DISPLACEMENT ISSUE?
coplanar EMULATION. THAT'S THE EASY PART.
okay.
what ABOUT THE HARD PART?
hard PART?
the CLOAK, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, WILL REPLACE THE SHIELD, WHICH MEANS THAT WE'LL BE COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED ONCE THE CLOAK'S ACTIVATED.
we'll BE COMPLETELY EXPOSED?
well, YES.
so IF THEY'RE NOT FOOLED BY THE RUSE...THEN THEY DESTROY THE CITY, WHICH, I REMIND YOU, IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO ANYWAY.
what ABOUT THE DAEDALUS?
well, IF IT DOESN'T WORK, OUR SHIELD SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY RECHARGED TO BREAK THROUGH THEIR LINES AND ESCAPE.
we KNOW WE CAN OUTRUN THEM.
all RIGHT.
let's GET AS MANY NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL ONTO YOUR SHIP AS WE CAN, JUST IN CASE.
I LOVE THIS IDEA, I REALLY DO,
but THE WRAITH ARE AWARE THAT WE HAVE CLOAKING TECHNOLOGY.
they ARE CLOSE, CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME TO CONNECT TO THEM.
if I CAN CONVINCE THEM THAT WE INTEND TO DESTROY ATLANTIS RATHER THAN ALLOW IT TO BE TAKEN, JUST BEFORE THE EXPLOSION OCCURS...
how WILL WE KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY BELIEVE YOU?
once THEY STOP THE BOMBARDMENT, WE'LL KNOW.
he's RIGHT.
if THE WRAITH BELIEVE THAT WE INTEND TO DESTROY THE CITY, THE LAST THING THEY'LL WANT TO DO IS TO HELP US DO IT.
how MUCH TIME DO YOU NEED?
Oh, UH, A WEEK. - COUPLE OF HOURS.
I'll TAKE THE SECOND ESTIMATE.
go.
what, ARE YOU UNION?
couple OF HOURS..."
he ESCAPED.
what? WHO?
he WAS ABLE TO DISARM ONE OF THE MARINES AND GOT AWAY WITH ALL THE WRAITH ENZYME I HAD LEFT.
ford, THIS IS SHEPPARD. COME IN.
I NEED YOU TO COME BACK TO THE CONTROL ROOM, BUDDY.
we're ALL GOING HOME.
lieutenant, DO YOU COPY?
you're JUST AFRAID OF ME, MAJOR.
you're AFRAID OF WHAT I CAN DO NOW.
I'm NOT LISTENING TO YOU.
I'm GOING AFTER HIM.
now's NOT THE RIGHT TIME!
now, I'M JOLTING YOU OUT OF THIS
the SECOND I FEEL THERE'S A PROBLEM.
I UNDERSTAND.
we're ALL SET DOWN HERE.
good. WE'RE ALMOST READY UP HERE.
ready. RADEK.
ready TO GO.
Colonel CALDWELL?
your PEOPLE ARE SECURELY ABOARD.
warhead HAS BEEN ARMED AND IS READY FOR DEPLOYMENT ON YOUR MARK.
very GOOD. STAND BY.
Dr. BECKETT?
I AM READY.
we're GOOD TO GO.
all RIGHT.
let's SEND OUR MESSAGE.
I'm ON ONE OF THE SHIPS.
they SEE ME.
the MESSAGE HAS BEEN DELIVERED.
Elizabeth, IT'S DONE.
seems THAT THEY HEARD TEYLA LOUD AND CLEAR.
Yeah, I THINK I'M READY.
you "THINK"?
I AM DEFINITELY READY.
Daedalus, LAUNCH THE WEAPON.
give ME CITY-WIDE.
attention ALL PERSONNEL.
prepare FOR DETONATION FLASH.
shut THEM DOWN!
the WEAPON IS AWAY.
if WE SWITCH TO THE CLOAK BEFORE THE BLAST RADIUS DIMINISHES, WE'LL ALL BE INCINERATED.
five SECONDS.
stand BY TO ENGAGE SUBLIGHT ENGINES ON MY MARK.
standing BY, SIR.
okay, THAT WAS DEFINITELY FIVE SECONDS!
we're CLOAKED.
how CAN YOU TELL?
they're SCANNING FOR US.
I COULD'VE SHOT YOU A COUPLE OF TIMES BY NOW.
well...
I'm GLAD YOU DIDN'T.
look, WHY DON'T YOU AND I...
just GO SOMEPLACE WHERE WE CAN TALK.
you're TRYING TO CHANGE ME BACK.
no.
I'm JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU.
no, YOU'RE NOT.
Oh, CRAP.
I DON'T THINK THEY'VE DETECTED US.
why ARE YOU WHISPERING?
I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
is IT WORKING OR NOT?
what THE HELL?
Where's FORD?
I ASSUME THAT'S HIM IN THAT JUMPER.
can THEY DETECT THAT? - I DON'T KNOW.
shut IT DOWN. - I CAN'T.
the JUMPER'S IN CONTROL.
stand DOWN!
this IS A DIRECT ORDER!
where THE HELL IS HE GOING?
it WON'T MATTER IF THE WRAITH CAN DETECT THE GATE ACTIVITY THROUGH THE CLOAK.
there's ONLY ONE WAY TO KNOW.
this IS DAEDALUS.
our SENSORS INDICATE THE WRAITH FLEET IS BREAKING ORBIT.
I CAN CONFIRM THAT.
they're HEADED FOR HYPERSPACE.
look, I'M GOING TO KEEP THE CLOAK UP FOR A WHILE, JUST TO BE SURE, BUT, UH...
I THINK THEY BOUGHT IT.
the GATE ADDRESS WILL BE IN THE LOG.
there's STILL A CHANCE
doesn't MATTER WHERE HE GOES.
the SECOND HE GETS TO WHEREVER HE'S GOING, HE'S GOING TO DITCH THE JUMPER, TURN AROUND, AND DIAL ANOTHER ADDRESS, ONE WE CAN'T TRACE.
we'll FIND HIM.
maybe.
at LEAST WE'RE STILL AROUND TO TRY.
caption from Kenshin
are you all right, colonel?
it's nothing. Just a cold. No big deal.
it's just annoying.
talk about annoying. - What?
we should be focusing on harvesting space gates.
that's what we're doing, rodney but the malp detected life signs.
we have to check it out.
that's the protocol.
I'm just saying that identifying potential space gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority not making contact with the locals of some backwater hamlet
are you that eager to return to earth, rodney?
this isn't just about me.
it is about the ability to go back and forth between earth and atlantis conveniently...
and whenever I want to
how's that work again?
okay...
once we've seeded enough stargates across the void between pegasus and the milky way we'll be able to take a jumper from one to the other to the other till we reach the other side.
that way, we won't tax the zpm we won't be reliant on the daedalus and travel time between earth and atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes
very clever.
Yes.
it was samantha carter's idea.
backwater hamlet dead ahead.
okay, let's just make contact buy our souvenirs, and...get out of here.
fair day to you.
fair day to you.
nothing here.
we should probably go.
Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals.
no, no, when you're right, you're right.
no, we're here now-- - hello!
Hello, new people!
why didn't anybody tell me the new people were here yet?
Lucius, I've missed you. - Oh, please.
well, I was just out for a walk.
have you met the new people yet?
we just got here.
Oh, great. Great.
then I haven't missed anything. I hate missing things.
have you met my wife, willa?
isn't she gorgeous?
my other wives are just making lunch.
fair day, lucius. - Hello, sweetheart.
Mwah! I love ya. I love ya.
fair day, everybody.
I'm john sheppard.
and you are from...
Yeah, athos. I've never been there.
it sounds nice.
is it nice?
until it was culled by the wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
what do you say you and me get together we have some lunch, we talk about this, huh?
maybe have some wine?
we don't even know your name.
we're serious.
you mean you truly have not heard of lucius?
well, everyone knows he's the wisest and kindest man among out people, just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody am I right?
well, then...
we're glad we met you.
and if you aren't yet, you will be.
come on let's have some lunch, huh?
everybody has to eat, right?
right this way, please. Please.
after you. Please.
fair day.
fair day here I come!
I love architecture.
it's all a mystery to me, really, but it hasn't stopped me from trying.
I see.
is she taken yet?
no...
nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
I love a woman with spirit...and a great body.
excuse me, lucius, please pardon my ignorance possibly even my manners, but what is it exactly about you...
I know what you're going to say.
so you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
what are those...gifts?
exploration alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say some of the best ointments around.
see, I could take care of that just like that.
it's just a cold.
nevertheless.
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
that's impressive.
you get used to it.
we'll do a trade.
so where are you all from?
no place in particular. We move around a lot.
in that wonderful machine of yours. Yeah, I saw it.
I was on a walk, I look up and I heard...somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring?
Yeah, that was us.
how does it fly?
it's complicated.
one has to-- - I mean, where do you get a machine like that?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
can I get one? Are they hard to fly?
yes...
they are hard to fly no, you can't have one.
but I want one.
please.
sorry.
perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines?
or perhaps not.
what, you come all this way you don't even want to trade?
look, it doesn't have to be the ship. Forget the ship.
I don't even want the ship, okay?
you've got to have some other stuff that you want to trade, right?
like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
lunch was great but I just realized we're running late.
for what?
for that important thing.
Yes, as much as we would love to stay, we really must go.
no, no, no. I don't want you to go. You just got here.
we haven't even had the second course.
please! I want you to see some of my medicines.
go get the ointments, the good ones. Go. Run. Go.
another time, lucius. We've got to go
no... no, I don't want you to leave.
okay, okay, okay.
all right.
let them go.
we're all friends here, right?
tell you what soon as we get back we'll tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer.
then we'll talk about trade.
later today, maybe?
maybe.
I'll have everything ready.
thank you.
you won't be disappointed!
nice people.
I think the word we're looking for is... obnoxious?
Unctuous?
either one of those works.
then again, the townspeople seem to love him, so maybe there's something to his medicine.
sounds like a snake oil salesman to me but it might be worth having beckett check it out.
well, I'm sure carson will be able to get us an answer pretty quickly.
so it's back out to scout for gates?
Yes. Right away.
it's not a race, rodney.
some of the herbs were gathered from this planet on my walks but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess.
I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
every single one?
well, every one in town.
the sick have been cured
the lame can walk again
well some still crawl but they crawl a lot faster than they used to - I see. - Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say, thank you, lucius. You have cured me. You are a wise and kind man.
young, old...
women...
do you like women, dr. Beckett?
what?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up around the square just waiting to be with you.
you know what I mean when I say "be with you," right?
I think so, yes.
I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
my medical kit?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember?
well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid I couldn't do that, lucius. Sorry.
not yet, anyway, huh?
come on. You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
how did the scout go?
well we found an unused gate in orbit over m3r-428.
one lousy gate.
we're never going to meet our quota at this rate - What quota? - My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair anyway.
we won't be able to harvest gates till it can fly.
did beckett bring back anything worth anything?
no, he hasn't returned yet.
he radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay a little longer.
the baby was frozen solid.
like a statue.
like a frozen statue.
it must have been in the water for what seemed like an eternity
I didn't know what to do.
I was a kid myself.
I take the baby and I open my coat and I tuck the baby inside and I start stroking the baby's back gently.
now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again but beat it did...
and a cry arose piercing the cold night air as if to say...
I am...alive.
astonishing.
and that baby...that baby grew up to be...that beautiful young lady.
no, no, not her, not her. Behind her.
maybe a little brain damage but just a little, but the story is true.
and thank you for sharing it with me.
Oh, please, dr. Beckett.
that's what I like doing most.
to share.
to share me.
and I can see that now. - You see?
all you had to do was get to know me.
you know, carson... may I call you carson?
of course you can.
Carson, this city that you keep going on and on about...
Atlantis .- Yeah, atlantis.
on a scale of one to 10, this village being a three...
Oh, atlantis is definitely a 10. It is...
Oh, yeah. And those flying ships, you still have those?
you mean the jumpers? Oh, aye, we have several.
how interesting. Tell me more.
look, lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
incoming wormhole.
opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's idc.
it's about time.
Oh, my. When you said this place was a 10, I thought, "okay, maybe... maybe it's an eight and a half, but this... - carson?
Dr. Weir... permit me to introduce lucius luvin.
speaking of stunning...
you never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I am definitely going to like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
I didn't think you'd mind.
you didn't think I'd mind?
you know the protocols. You even helped come up with them.
there's so much he can offer us.
is this the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?
I know my business, colonel sheppard.
he happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
Really? That guy?
Aye.
he also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
did you just say gourds?
Yes, rodney. Gourds.
we don't know everything, despite what you may think he could prove to be a very powerful ally.
he's a very wise and kind man.
are you feeling all right?
what do you mean?
it's just you're acting... a little... - smitten?
I had another word in mind.
this is not something to treat lightly.
no, it isn'T.
you've brought a stranger to atlantis without prior approval.
now he knows about the city, as well as our gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
he comes in peace as our friend.
you have his word and mine on that.
do you think he poses a threat?
definitely a nuisance.
if what beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value to us.
we'll just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out to scout more gates.
tell teyla and ronon not to let him out of their sight.
here we are.
it's perfect.
because you could always have my own personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
don't be silly, carson.
I mean, you know, I'll take a look at what you have if you insist, but.
this'll do fine for now.
Oh, good. I'm so pleased.
just let me know if you want anything.
Oh, I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
except that...
what?
no, it's nothing.
no, tell me.
I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
Oh, lucius... just give them a chance to get to know you.
I just hope I get that chance.
Oh, you will, I promise.
in fact, I'm sure dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
Really?
really
Oh, that'd be great.
Oh, hello.
I was going to go get something to eat because they forgot to bring me something so...
are you guys not allowed to talk?
guests are not permitted to move about the city unescorted.
well, what do you say you escort me then? Huh? Huh?
you don't like me yet, do you?
yet? - I'm sorry.
my manners just fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
isn't she something? Huh?
Yeah.
we will have something sent to you.
Oh, no, no. Come on.
come on. Don't make me sit in there all alone. Come on, please?
very well. We will both take you.
Oh, both. Both is good. Yeah, we'll get to know each other then.
like how do you get your hair to go like that?
just listen to what he has to say.
thank you. Fine.
I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
it seems...excessive.
and I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet lucius with such hostility.
perhaps it's because you broke protocol, endangering...
and for that I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally?
fine.
have him come up to my office.
Hello, dr. Weir
Hello, dr. Weir.
Hello, dr. Weir.
thank you for granting me this audience.
it's hardly that, mr. Luvin.
no, please.
Lucius.
may this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
thank you.
I made it myself.
the gourd is from the marshes of my homeworld topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
how nice.
it's nothing.
please, have a seat.
after you.
what are you doing?
huh?
I've been told that you would like to negotiate a possible alliance between our two peoples.
an alliance?
okay.
sure.
I mean, that's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
well, then...
why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us.
besides candles.
right.
one tiny settlement on the entire planet.
look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
we're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their gate.
Hey. Welcome back.
Where's zelenka?
well, he's not here.
no, no one's here.
where is everyone?
I'm standing outside. I don't know what to do.
I ran. I ran!
and I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay?
so here's what I do. Okay, I'm standing there and I'm running, and I see the beast, just coming towards me so I just stepped to my left, I turn around and just as he's coming to me, I take my sword, I draw it and lop off its head.
Yeah, and I bend over, I pick it up and I walk in triumph back to the village.
amazing - You didn'T. - Oh, yes, my giant friend.
I did, and let me tell you this
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night.
repeatedly.
what the hell is going on?
what do you mean?
what do I mean?
we leave for a few hours and lucius turns you all into stepford wives.
what did he do to you?
absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
he has much to offer us.
herbs and gourds? Please the medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
you're really telling me the ointment is worth something?
I haven't actually tested it.
Oh, you're just taking his word for it?
you got a problem with that?
me?
uh, no.
he might this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know.
I hope I didn't upset him.
you just haven't taken the time to get to know lucius.
Carson is right. Again.
I think he could be a great asset to us.
he has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
has he shared any of this intelligence?
not yet, but...
he did give me this.
a very wise and kind man.
this is creeping me out reminds me of an old batman episode, actually.
catwoman used a drug to put a spell on batman make him fall in love with her.
ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
kind of a turn-on, actually.
Julie newmar in the cat outfit...
eartha kitt was catwoman.
Yeah. You didn't know that?
Oh, so anyway
I did a little investigating and...
surveillance footage from his quarters
what's this?
Ah...
I took the liberty of searching his room.
there's some residue from the liquid still in the vial.
it'll take some time to break it down.
I could have used carson's help on this, but...he's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
right.
that's brilliant.
this is actually how we found your planet.
so you just fly to a planet, you take the gate, you fly away.
well, we try to take stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet and then only if the planet is uninhabited.
obviously, it wouldn't be right to take a gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
wait a minute.
I've heard of this planet.
you have?
Yeah, I have.
and I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited. It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys but I've got a good feeling about this planet.
well, then we could retrofit the gate for space deployment.
beautiful and brilliant.
the two bs. Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, john.
we were just discussing the gate harvesting program.
Yeah, I heard.
and lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that, too.
we got intel that the wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
an alliance of three hives.
no.
Really?
has your intel been verified?
we haven't put boots on the ground no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
I'm not going to send a team down there, not when there's still plenty of gates to scout. You are way behind rodney's quota.
forget rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
you know what?
Colonel sheppard is right.
don't get me wrong.
with all your advanced weapons you could easily dispose of a tiny wraith outpost if there even is an outpost but ultimately is it worth the risk?
no matter how small that risk may be. I mean, sure people may label you a coward.
will you knock it off?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
no.
I won't allow it. are you questioning my authority?
when it comes to the security of this base you're damn right I am.
from now on, no one goes through that gate without my authorization.
what a terrible cold he must have.
this is not like him, lucius.
I apologize.
he makes me uncomfortable.
he's really a good man.
I don't see it.
if he doesn't come around you're going to have to do something.
wants to send a team to check out a gate at a suspected wraith outpost.
what is she, nuts?
everybody's nuts, rodney. Haven't you noticed? - Right.
you need to figure out why without drawing too much attention.
I am working on it but there's not enough of the liquid to work with.
I need more.
I'll go back to lucius's village.
I'm sure he keeps a stash there. I'll just grab some.
you're leaving me here alone?
you said you need the liquid.
Yeah, but the place is turning into a nuthouse.
somebody's got to stay. Just keep away from the nuts.
and you've got to disable the dhd as soon as I'm gone to prevent anybody from dialing out, okay?
are you all right?
where is he?
did you take him?
of course, if you did, we're not angry.
he came to my planet on his own.
please send him back.
it hurts us to be away from him for so long.
have you always felt this way about him?
no but one day as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people he told me a story a wonderful, wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
and from that day forward we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
and before that?
I am ashamed to admit that.
I refused to share his bed more than once and since he has gone, everyone is growing sick.
it has only gotten worse.
take it easy.
have you ever seen him drink A...a liquid from a small vial?
his daily medicine. - Does he need more?
I could bring it to him.
we both can.
I can handle it.
if we get you some...
will you bring him home?
sure.
incoming wormhole. Colonel sheppard's idc.
and the next day she became my wife my fifth wife and now I have six.
you are a scoundrel, you know that? It's what you are.
Sheppard, come here. You've got to hear this.
Lucius was just telling the most hysterical story.
do you know that they have marmots on his planet?
well, they're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent very similar to
I thought you said you were going to stay away from the nuts.
Yes, well.
I tried to keep to myself, but lucius here was concerned for me so he just came down ronon held me against the wall, and lucius and i had a nice, long talk.
Oh, you did.
and let me tell you we have nothing to worry about with this guy.
this guy's just a big knucklehead. Aren't you, you big knucklehead?
Where's elizabeth?
she's out making me something to eat.
what?
I don't know. She said it was a surprise.
so rodney and i were waiting here for the team to return.
we thought that you were them.
Teyla, ronon, and beckett.
they volunteered to check out m6h-491
I told you-- - to disable the dhd. I know. I'm sorry. I didn'T.
but come on.
ronon and teyla. I mean, they can handle themselves.
what about beckett?
well, he... now, he can walk on his hands. Did you know that?
he was showing lucius before he left.
you should have seen it. He was down on his hands...
we don't know for sure that there are even wraith on the planet.
we'll find out soon enough, though, won't we?
we sure will.
Atlantis, this is beckett! We're coming in hot!
you all right? - It was a little rough, but we're good.
it was all terribly exciting.
well, I guess we can assume there are wraith on that planet.
Yes. Many.
now, don't overreact, john.
are you kidding me?
you send a team led by beckett to a planet full of wraith?
how do you expect me to react?
well, firstly, they volunteered. - And secondly we got the herb.
I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
you will?
Yes, I will
you sent them to get an herb?
we wanted to go.
okay.
I've just about had enough.
don't touch it.
what on earth is wrong with you, john?
we were just helping a friend...
and there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
you know what?
I'm just tired.
it's this damn cold.
I apologize.
maybe you should get some rest.
you're probably right. I just need a good night's sleep.
so, what does this do?
that engages the hud. Stands for "heads up display.
heads up... I love that.
it gives me whatever information I need when flying the jumper.
navigation, weapons...
you can fly this? - I can fly it, too.
Yes, now that you received the A. T.A. Therapy, which I invented.
I was actually born with the gene which makes me much more proficient at operating ancient technology.
it does not. He doesn't fly this thing any better than I do.
don't you lie to lucius-- - all right... boys stop fighting
a gene, you say?
it's a genetic fingerprint, if you will which allows someone such as me to operate any technology on atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene such as dr. Mckay, to be able to use some of it as well.
Really?
a gene, huh?
an inoculation, huh? That's great.
you know what's really interesting-- if you look at this down here...
doc?
could I speak with you for a sec?
excuse me.
I... think there might be something wrong with me.
it's all right, son.
admitting it is the first step.
so you finally came around, did you?
you see? Once you get a chance to know lucius he's really a very wise and kind...
Oh, crap.
why is the jumper bay roof opening?
jumper three is starting up. Who's in it?
I don't know.
jumper three, please identify
jumper three, this is flight. Identify yourself.
look, close the door.
it's too late. It's left the bay.
Hey, carson. Sorry about that.
what... why...
I'm taking you to the mainland.
for your own good. Trust me.
how often does that happen?
this has never happened before.
we have very, very strict flight protocol.
he'd have to have a key or something-- - a security officer saw colonel sheppard carrying dr. Beckett toward the jumper bay moments before the jumper took off.
so it was them in the flying machine?
my computer's missing.
a tablet, two drives, all of my research.
I told you that man was dangerous.
I have to say, liz, I am very disappointed right now.
I am so very sorry, lucius.
mobilize jumper teams.
I want them found. - Yes.
they're very good. They will find them.
I need to get back.
no, you don'T.
Lucius needs me.
you have no right to abduct me like this.
call it an intervention.
you probably don't realize it right now but what you're going through is kind of like A...a detox.
now according to the research rodney was able to do before joining the lucius fan club that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
it interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone and then there's something about gamma activity in the prefrontral cortrex.
prefrontal cortex.
the part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
see? That's why I need you.
it seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone in close proximity, it makes them...easy to influence and the longer they're exposed the worse the addiction gets.
you mean literally an addictive personality?
that's what it looks like.
it's rubbish!
check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of extract made from the herb that you collected for him.
he made you his mule.
if this is true, why weren't you affected?
my cold. I can hardly breathe.
plus I haven't been around him much.
look...
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere until the pheromone wore off but the people back on his home planet are starting to get sick and it looks like they're going to get worse before they get better.
I don't want to put our people through that.
you're doing it to me right now!
buck up, carson.
you haven't been exposed that long.
I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
there's got to be an antidote of some kind.
I can'T.
Yes, you can.
you can beat it.
but he needs me.
we should head bacK.
we've been searching for hours.
we just left, mckay
I don't like being this far away from atlantis.
Lucius is probably worried.
you think he's worried? - Jumper two, report.
we're reading several life signs, but they might be athosian hunting parties.
we're going to go check them out - Is lucius worried about us? - Lucius?
he's fine. Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
wait just a minute.
what is it?
don't move.
that thing is set to stun, right?
Yeah.
good.
Carson, are you all right?
I will be, once I get back to lucius.
what did you shoot him for?
now we're going to have to carry him all the way back to the jumper
good morning, colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that elizabeth had to do this.
cut the crap.
So...that herb of yours...one of my greatest discoveries.
well, it's my only great discover, but you got to admit it's pretty great.
how did you get by before that?
I was a baker.
bread, mostly.
the occasional muffin at festival time.
so that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread.
I like to experiment...
and I noticed that people started to like me.
well, hate me less but pretty soon it became "like.
so I perfected a potion.
it worked great for years.
then the wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb。
I knew I could never go back there.
until we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate...
and everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
see, that's the great thing about this herb.
nobody gets hurt.
they just want to help me all the time. What's wrong with that?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything they didn't want to do.
six wives?
sometimes all at once.
you know, when you get over this cold, you and I are going to have a long chat, face to face and I've got a feeling we're going to become the best of friends and you're going to want to help me, too, all the time and you'll love it.
just a warning, lucius
you should never get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.
that's all right, colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Yeah, go ahead, carson.
I've finished preparing the inoculation.
all right, I'll be right down.
I've got to go get an inoculation.
we'll talk after.
he's giving you the A. T.A. Therapy?
Yeah.
isn't that great?
there. All done.
now, remember it's only effective in 47% of those who receive it.
well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
the only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
okay.
it takes about an hour to be effective.
in the meantime just rest easy, dear friend.
are you feeling okay? Can I get you anything?
no, rodney.
I'm fine. - You sure? Absolutely.
because it would be no trouble. - Mess hall.
blue jello.
little bit of whipped cream.
right away.
we really should talk about marriage.
jumper one, this is flight.
the bay doors are open.
you are go for launch "Go for launch." That's so exciting.
all right, here goes.
I'll take it from here.
you're supposed to be in jail.
save your breath. Your charm no longer has any effect on me.
no... no, but carson...
we're supposed to be best of friends.
Carson didn't give you the A. T.A. Gene.
what?
I'm afraid it's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
took some myself.
Oh.
I don't know what that means.
it means we can have that face-to-face conversation you always wanted us to have.
the only thing that will happen is you'll catch my cold.
what is taking him so long?
I should go up there.
wait. Wait!
they're taking off.
it worked!
he's flying it.
fly, lucius, fly.
where are you taking me?
little vacation.
just enough time to let dr. Beckett give the serum to the rest of my people without you interfering.
and then what?
then maybe I'll take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
you would do that for me?
without even being under the effect of the herb?
after all I did?
well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, colonel, I can't thank you enough.
thank you so much...
after I give them the serum.
so how was lucius' homecoming?
well... they didn't kill him although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
that's if they haven't strung him up first.
well, the townspeople are over their withdrawal and on the mend so I doubt that will happen.
that is unless we discover he's revealed the location of atlantis to anyone.
in which case I said I would track him down - hang him by his feet, and cut off his-- - thank you.
we get the idea.
so everyone here...back to normal?
we're still fine, john.
no lingering desires?
secret longings for his touch?
it's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us thank you.
all right, all right.
Hey, buddy, I'd better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
right.
it was one teeny, tiny taste, for research purposes.
burn it. - All of it.
right now.
fine.
praise the gods, you've finally arrived and you are far more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.
excuse me?
you have not come for the arranged marriage?
no.
would you perhaps be seeking a husband? - No.
then what brings you to our town?
we've heard of strangers who recently arrived a rough-looking group, boasting of many wraith kills?
Yeah, we think they might be satedan.
Ah, yes, you mean the three loud-mouthed drunkards who spend their days carousing at the tavern?
sounds like my people.
thank you. - You are most welcome and should you ever reconsider your desire for a husband...
sounds good.
hello.
I'm looking for three individuals who recently arrived.
I've heard they are voracious eaters and drinkers, and apparently, they've been quite vocal about their recent successes against the wraith.
these people you're looking for...
they're either very brave, or very stupid.
how so?
well if word of their bragging got back to the wraith it could be very bad for them.
I doubt they need to fear a wraith overhearing their conversation.
of course not but the wraith don't always need their own ears to hear.
do you know the people whom I seek?
sorry.
I mind my own business which is something you might want to consider.
and you might want to consider offering your unsolicited advice to someone who actually cares to receive it.
an attitude like that could get you hurt or worse.
what's the first to go?
the ears, or those pretty eyes?
how about your head?
hmm, heard the rumor?
no, what rumor?
never mind. Forget I mentioned it.
wait. What is this about?
no, it would be irresponsible for me to say anything.
all right, look, if you're going to twist my arm, the I. O.A. Have made their final decision.
they've chosen the new leader of atlantis.
well, who is it?
well, there's been no formal announcement, but word is, they're going with their foremost expert in ancient technology and replicator activity.
who does that sound like to you?
you? - Yes. Who else?
well, I heard they were leaning toward someone with a science background...
and why not? It's about time that one of us ended up in a position of real power.
Oh, oh, and by "us," you mean "you.
exactly.
it's kind of scary, though.
you know, I'll be making decisions that don't affect just the city, but the entire galaxy.
Yes, scary.
very scary - On the other hand a leader never second-guesses himself.
I'm up for the challenge.
I know I am.
I'm going to make them proud.
Radek, I'm going to make you proud.
the wraith-replicator war is in full swing.
from what I hear, the replicators are kicking some serious ass in their last offensive.
that's good news, john. Well done.
Hey! - I'll have the reports ready for you.
uh... what's new?
just making preparations for the change in command here.
you don't have to tell me. I already know.
Really?
I just want to say that I think the I. O.A. Could not have made a better choice.
Thanks, rodney.
no, no, no, no, you are too kind.
what?
uh... "thank you, rodney.
no, no, wait a minute. You mean the...
reunion
I thought you guys were dead.
believe me, so did we.
how did you manage to survive the wraith attack on sateda?
we weren't there.
I don't understand.
when we first made the decision to fight back against the wraith, we didn't just wait for them to come to us.
we started running ops against some of their known strongholds.
they were quick strikes.
get in, hit 'em hard, get out.
only on this particular occasion, we kind of messed up the getting out part.
I saw the darts hit your position.
what you didn't see was that we'd found a network of caves in the hillside.
when the wraith attacked the entrance collapsed, and we were sealed in.
it took us three days to dig our way out.
and by then, the place was crawling with them.
it was obvious they were gearing up for an attack.
took another two weeks before we could find our way through the gate, and by then...it was too late.
when we got back to sateda, there was nothing left.
I'm sorry.
I should have never left you behind.
when you took second squad back to the gate, you had no way of knowing those darts were going to come through.
and if we'd have gone back with you then we would have died in the attack on sateda along with everybody else.
the only reason why you survived was because they made you a runner.
you heard about that?
a while back, we started hearing stories.
they said you were seven feet tall and had the strength of five men.
people like to exaggerate.
they also said you killed a hundred wraith.
that part sounds about right.
well, then...
to the misery of our enemies and the reunion of friends come back from the dead.
Oh, yeah.
on the day I left chulak master bratac said to me "draw from your past but do not let your past draw from you.
that's good advice.
still, I know I'm going to miss this place, and all of you.
I would have been offended had you felt otherwise.
10 years is a long time.
it has been 10 years well spent.
we have defeated numerous enemies and overcome many threats.
it was never dull.
we have accomplished much here but now it is atlantis that is in need of you.
Yeah...part of me is looking forward to going, but...you know, there's a part of me that thinks maybe it's too soon, that I'm leaving my work here unfinished.
your work will continue only in a different place.
you have been bestowed an incredible honor, colonel carter, and I believe you should embrace it.
and know this...though we may not be leaving with you, sg-1 will never be far away.
so I can expect you guys to come and visit sometime?
undomesticated equines could not keep me away.
nice call-back.
indeed
all right.
time to go.
what's that?
it's a selection of fruits from the various worlds we trade with.
I thought it'd be thoughtful.
try lame.
really, and what would you suggest?
you know, maybe some flowers.
you could brighten up her quarters.
Oh, flowers.
here, take this, and go.
Colonel carter welcome to atlantis.
thank you.
it's nice to be here.
I want you all to know how honored I am to accept this appointment.
I've come here fully committed to this expedition, to atlantis, and most importantly, to each and every one of you.
I look forward to working with all of you.
thank you.
nice speech.
thank you.
I also do weddings and award shows.
book early to avoid disappointment.
should we go check out your new digs?
yeah
stings, doesn't it?
what the hell have the three of you been doing all these years?
Oh eating, drinking killing wraith
we've hit 'em more times than I can count.
racked up a pretty nice body count.
not to mention the 12 darts we've downed.
we're armed, mobile, and, occasionally, get good intel.
well, sounds like a pretty nice run.
but there have been a few sacrifices.
yeah? What do you mean?
there were five of us who came out of that cave alive...
but we lost marika on the first assault against the wraith and then hemi last year.
it hasn't been easy.
we don't have much to work with, but we make do.
sometimes, it's not enough.
Yeah, well, I might be able to help.
we've got the manpower, the equipment.
my friends and I, we can...
anyway, um...
to marika and hemi.
to marika and hemi.
to marika and hemi.
thank you
Hey, rodney. Come on in.
I brought you a little something to spruce up the place.
well, thank you. That's very sweet.
there's a vase right there.
Oh, colonel sheppard dropped that off.
apparently, it's a sampling of fruit from the home worlds of our various trading partners.
I thought it was a really thoughtful gesture.
son of A...
anyway look, I just... I just came by to welcome you to atlantis, see how you're settling in, and you know, if you needed anything, and did I mention I was seeing someone?
I'm sorry, what?
I'm, uh, seeing someone.
Yes, I only bring it up now because you're here now and we'll be working together a lot more, and our past?
well, you know, the unrequited lust that's been hanging over our heads for what seems like forever.
I just don't want things to be awkward between the two of us, you know?
kind of like they are now.
I'm sure we'll be fine.
Oh, of course. I mean, I'll be fine. I'm just...with you... - I hear you're in charge.
Ronon, this is colonel carter. Sam, this is ronon. He's satedan and a member of your team. Of course.
what can I do for you?
I want to bring some friends to atlantis, and, apparently, I've got to clear it through you first.
unfortunately, some new security procedures prevent me from allowing any off-world visits to atlantis for the time being.
on whose authority?
it was a directive from the I. O.A.
well, they don't need to know.
Ronon, she's
I'm sure you understand what a precarious position we're in here.
it is imperative that the location of this base remain a secret.
and it will.
they're my people. I'll vouch for them.
I'm sure you can, but for now, we're on a new planet with a new set of rules.
and a new person in charge.
Weir never would've doubted me.
okay, first of all, ronon,
I'm not doubting you.
these new regulations apply to everyone on this base, and secondly...
I'm not dr. Weir.
is he always like that?
no, no...
no, actually, you caught him on a good day.
try it together, and turn!
work on it.
well, that was fast.
Yeah, I said it would be.
you could have taken your time.
we like it here.
we're thinking of staying on a few more days.
then where will you go?
wherever.
that's one of the nice things about not being tied down.
you go where you want, and you leave when you're not wanted.
Yeah, well, I was hoping my people would show a little bit more hospitality, but...
don't worry about it.
I understand.
not everybody gets an invitation to atlantis.
don't look so surprised.
you travel as much around this galaxy as we do and sooner or later, you'll start hearing rumors about new people in the city of the ancients and the runner who joined 'em.
man, I'm sorry.
I wish I could've been straight with you from the start.
they placed their trust in you, and you proved them worthy.
I wouldn't have expected any less.
Yeah, but still-- - what you thought they'd make an exception because it was you asking?
I'm supposed to be their friend-- - no.
you're their ally.
their guest.
me, rakai, and ara, we're your friends.
I don't doubt they're good people.
they helped you out when you needed it and from what I hear, they've done more to hurt the wraith than anyone.
you've got to respect that but it doesn't mean you've got to commit to them.
the way I see it, now that we're back together...
you belong with us.
pretty impressive, isn't it?
to be honest, it's a little overwhelming.
coming from somebody with your record, that says something.
you know, john, your name was on the short list.
Yeah, I know.
I saw what they did to elizabeth, the politics and the red tape. I didn't envy her.
I don't envy you.
Thanks.
you know, for most of us, this thing with elizabeth isn't over yet.
she's still out there.
you really believe there's a chance she's still alive?
there's only one way to know for sure.
we should have done it sooner but the I. O.A.'S been stonewalling me.
now that you're in charge, maybe you can give me the green light.
I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous.
it's no more dangerous than the last time we went in.
circumstances were different. Plus, you had an advantage then that you don't have now.
well, she's the one who gave us that advantage.
the only reason we're here is because of what she did.
believe me, I know and I don't like the idea of leaving someone behind any more than you do but I'm not about to send you or anyone else on a suicide mission.
now, you come to me with a plan that has an even an outside chance of succeeding and I'll consider it.
short of that, john, I'm sorry.
there's nothing I can do.
fair enough.
you seem distracted today.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
what's wrong? - There's nothing. I told you, I'm fine.
very well. I suppose we should just continue training.
there's nothing!
okay, stop hitting me!
God... I'll talk.
I'm thinking of leaving atlantis.
where would you go?
must it come down to a choice between atlantis and your satedan friends?
they're more than my friends, teyla. They're my family.
we've always been there for each other.
you wouldn't understand.
I disagree.
leaving my fellow athosians for a home here on atlantis was a very difficult decision.
I was their leader.
for some the only leader they'd ever known and despite the fact that I was as close as a trip through the stargate there were moments when I felt I'd betrayed them.
so what? You got over it? - No.
I sometimes still second-guess my decision then I remember that I can do more here to help my people and the rest of humans in this galaxy than I ever could on my home world.
Teyla's already spoken to you, hasn't she?
Yeah, well, we had a little chat.
so let's hear it.
hear what?
whatever you've got to say.
not going to say anything. - Really?
I don't have to, because you already know what I'm going to tell you.
that you're a valuable member of my team and that it would be difficult to find somebody to take your place.
and that you may think you're going back to find something you've lost, but there's nothing to go back to.
you're not going to say any of that?
I don't have to.
look, this isn't about me trying to bring back the past.
well, then what is it?
they need me.
they always have.
I'm the one that took care of them, got them home alive whenever we went into battle.
you're one man, ronon.
you can't expect to protect them forever.
probably not...
but that's where you guys come in.
we got some intel on araith target.
the wraith and the replicators are kind of beating the crap out of each other right now.
I think it's counter-productive to run an op against them.
I have a feeling you'll change your mind once you hear the details.
let's hear it.
not yet.
you want to hit a wraith lab?
no offense, but that's awfully close to
it's a weapons research facility.
from what we've heard, the place is undermanned
we know the wraith are being attacked on several fronts.
they don't have the resources anymore to properly guard all their facilities.
still, she did say, "undermanned" rather than "unmanned.
there is a big difference.
it won't matter. We can handle it.
then why do you need our help to pull it off?
we don'T.
but we will need your help to get away once we're done.
I see.
we're your designated drivers.
this is our target.
it's located a good half day's journey from the gate on foot.
having a ship would make things a whole lot easier getting us in and out before any reinforcements arrive.
don't worry. All you got to do is fly.
we'll do the legwork.
well, that's very considerate of you, but if we commit, we're all in.
and I really don't see why we would.
I mean, sure it would be great to get our hands on some new wraith tech, but maybe if we stumbled across a stockpile, or maybe bought some off of ebay, but
I think what he's trying to say is, we're not really sure if we want to risk our lives for something like this.
maybe wait a month or two let the replicators and the wraith soften each other up then we do lunch, we talk about it again.
one of the things they're working on right now in the lab is a way to switch off the replicator attack code.
is such a thing even possible?
the wraith may have done it the first time.
well, we can't let it happen.
no.
if the war with the replicators ends, then the wraith will once again be able to direct their attention to the rest of the galaxy.
so...
are you in?
your buddies seem like a perfectly capable enough bunch but if I do this, the last thing I need is someone going off half-cocked and risking this op and, well, oh, yeah, our asses.
this isn't their first time doing this, john.
may be the first time doing it with company though, and I don't want it turning into a big pissing match.
Yeah, well, I'll keep my group in line. Do the same for yours.
last time I checked, it was your group, too.
yeah...
look, I was going to wait to tell you this, but I've made my decision.
once we finish this op
I'm going to be leaving atlantis.
come on in.
packing?
Yeah.
you know, the fact that you brought all this stuff here tells me that you considered atlantis home that you were happy here
Yeah, well, I was.
I am.
your friends are worried about you.
well, they shouldn't be. I can take care of myself.
that's not the point.
when you accepted the offer to join atlantis, you became a part of something and, like it or not, you have roots here now people who care about you, who depend on you.
walking away may be a lot harder than you think.
Oh, I'm not walking away.
just because I'm not a part of sheppard's team does not mean I'm any less willing to help out atlantis, or put my life on the line for any of you.
I'm not questioning your loyalty, ronon, only the wisdom in leaving, if, as you say, you don't want to turn your back on atlantis.
coordinating our efforts with you and your friends may not be so easy.
we're about to find out, aren't we?
I need you to reconsider your decision to leave.
and if I don't, given everything that I know about atlantis you going to try and stop me?
I'm hoping it won't come to that.
put us down near the south end.
we'll meet less resistance if we access this place through the back.
got it.
once we head in, we'll take the lead.
you watch our backs.
do you know where you're going?
our target is located somewhere on the second level.
uh, maybe you could be a little more specific?
we don't have an exact floor plan, if that's what you're asking.
the whole second level is a high-security sector.
if you are unsure, would it not be counter-productive for us to follow you?
it's better this way.
these wraith facilities are very confusing.
we know what we're looking for.
Oh, and we don't?
this isn't exactly our first op, you know.
really.
how many wraith have you killed in hand-to-hand combat?
I hardly think that's what this is about.
that's what I thought. - You know, we've taken out entire hive ships, okay?
compared to us, you are amateurs.
easy.
if we can't play nice together, then let's not.
we got a lot of ground to cover in a short amount of time, so we will follow your lead then we'll split up into two teams once we reach the second level.
are you cool with that?
Yes.
good.
approaching target location.
this is it.
hurry up!
I got it.
everybody in.
we'll go this way. You go that way.
contact us if you find anything.
yeah
good luck.
let's go.
what do you think?
test subjects? Or the wraith version of a vending machine.
I hate to be the guy to say it, but we can't really help these people.
we got to keep moving.
right
this thing's been way too quiet and way too easy.
I kind of like quiet and easy. Makes for a nice change.
wraith!
Ronon, wait!
Rodney, get that door open!
the hell with it.
Aw, come on, it worked for him!
Hah! I did it!
Oh, thank god, it's you three.
they got teyla and sheppard, and
bring him.
who's the amateur now?
Ronon, what happened?
I need to talk to colonel carter right away
John, are you all right?
bit of a hangover.
the fact that ronon and his buddies aren't here is a good sign.
not really.
ronon's buddies are the reason we're here. They set us up.
what are you talking about?
I ran into them while I was trying to esc...
while I was effecting a strategic retreat.
they stunned me.
are you sure?
it's pretty hard to misinterpret something like that.
was ronon with them?
I didn't see him.
that one.
hold on, here, guys.
stay strong, rodney!
I'll try.
I said, I'm fine.
I tried to radio sheppard, but got no response from him, teyla, or mckay.
and what about the satedans?
we got separated.
I'm guessing the wraith got to them, too.
so much for this op being a cake-walk.
okay we've gone from support to rescue and recovery.
Dr. Zelenka, ready a jumper
Yes, colonel.
they'll be expecting us.
make that two jumpers.
would you guys mind telling me where we're going?
seriously, I'm not big on surprises.
even as a kid, I had to sneak a peek at my christmas presents because I couldn't stand the suspense.
I remember this one time-- - we require your assistance.
with what?
you tampered with the replicator base code.
I don't know what you're talking about.
okay, I may have made a few small adjustments. So what?
this is not the first time they have challenged us.
so it was the wraith that deactivated the attack code.
many thousands of years ago.
we had defeated the ancients. The galaxy was ours, and then these...
things appeared.
I take it you're not a big fan-- - they are an abomination!
they're not even alive.
in other words, you can't eat them, so they're no good to you.
they are machines.
machines can be reprogrammed.
okay, fine, so, what do you want from me?
we have attempted to upload the deactivation virus once again.
our attempts have been unsuccessful.
we need you to undo the changes you made so as to render the virus once more effective against them.
of course. I see.
things is, that could be kind of tricky.
the test subject will make things easier for you.
test subject?
a replicator.
Oh, my god.
I've thought about it, and I want you to know that when the time comes, I'll respect whatever decision you make regarding your future with us.
this could be the one and only op we go on together.
then we'd better make the most of it.
Dr. Mckay...how is your work progressing?
it's been kind of slow.
I mean, re-establishing the base code's original setting isn't something I'll be able to accomplish overnight.
Colonel sheppard and teyla will be most disappointed to hear this.
I'll see to it.
I think I might be able to get it finished much sooner.
I understand your desire to delay in the hope that it will give your people time to mount a rescue.
in fact, I've just received word they're on their way, but we are ready for them.
okay, they're moving away.
thank you, jumper two.
take us in, lieutenant.
Yes, colonel.
let's go, let's go!
there's a power relay behind this wall here.
you all right? - Well, it's about time.
any longer, we would've had to save ourselves.
did ronon manage to make it back to atlantis?
he did. - Where is he?
we split up to cover more ground.
secure the entrance. Let's go.
all right, come on, let's get out of here.
where are you holding them?
why don't you ask your friends?
all clear.
all clear? You could've shot me!
Oh, no.
Oh, no...
let's go find ronon.
deal with him.
you're wraith-worshipers?
Ronon, you need to understand that-- - after what they did to sateda!
sateda is gone and so are the lives we knew.
we had a choice to die with the past, or live for the future.
what did they do to you?
they rewarded us with the gift of everlasting life.
the same gift can be yours, if you're willing to accept it.
we resisted at first, we were stubborn, but the wraith were determined.
they showed us our futures.
they allowed us to experience our life's end, pushing us to the brink so that we could see the truth, and brought us back
they showed us again, and again, and again...
until they broke you.
until we finally accepted the truth and their gift join us.
you're insane.
don't let your pride get in the way.
like marika and hemi.
they didn't die on any run, did they?
they were murdered because they wouldn't turn.
they were killed by their own stubbornness.
don't make the same mistake.
join us! - No.
never.
run. You run.
run, and get away while you can, because the next time we meet, it will not be as friends.
there won't be a next time.
we'll finish this like true satedans.
you are not satedans!
rakai, no!
so much for honor.
no weapons.
hasn't there been enough killing?
huh?
Ronon, where are your friends?
they're right here.
let's go home.
is that my painting?
Yes.
Rodney felt that you should have it back.
I didn't give it to him.
well, he helped himself, assuming that you were leaving it behind.
how you feeling?
all right.
it's nice to have you back.
Thanks.
it's good to be back.
praise the gods, you've finally arrived and you are far more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.
excuse me?
you have not come for the arranged marriage?
no.
would you perhaps be seeking a husband? - No.
then what brings you to our town?
we've heard of strangers who recently arrived a rough-looking group, boasting of many Wraith kills?
Yeah, we think they might be Satedan.
Ah, yes, you mean the three loud-mouthed drunkards who spend their days carousing at the tavern?
sounds like my people.
they've taken rooms in the local inn.
thank you. - You are most welcome and should you ever reconsider your desire for a husband...
sounds good.
Hello?
I'm looking for three individuals who recently arrived.
I've heard they are voracious eaters and drinkers, and apparently, they've been quite vocal about their recent successes against the Wraith.
these people you're looking for...
they're either very brave, or very stupid.
how so?
well, if word of their bragging got back to the Wraith it could be very bad for them.
I doubt they need to fear a Wraith overhearing their conversation.
of course not, but the Wraith don't always need their own ears to hear.
do you know the people whom I seek?
sorry.
I mind my own business, which is something you might want to consider.
and you might want to consider offering your unsolicited advice to someone who actually cares to receive it,
an attitude like that could get you hurt, or worse.
what's the first to go?
the ears, or those pretty eyes?
how about your head?
hmm, heard the rumor?
no, what rumor?
never mind. Forget I mentioned it.
wait. What is this about?
no, it would be irresponsible for me to say anything.
