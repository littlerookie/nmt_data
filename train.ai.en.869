OK. Lloyd.
OK. We have reasons to believe our security was breached by hands.
you have to speak up. - Can you hear me?
I know I didn't hear one - What?
can you hear me?
Bruce, it's not working - It's not working

Yeah, I can hear now
sorry, Chief, someone let me to believe the cone was ready
for the record, I never actually used the word "ready"
"show them the cone," "well, go for the cone," "the cone is the sizzler
you said that
Lloyd, shut up now.
listen up people, given a Russian thief of nuclear material especially yellow cake Uranium of the last three month.
now, base on Max's intel we are able to get Agent 38 inside KAOS
we must have been close to cover something big.
so KAOS hit us and hit us hard.
during the confusion they hacked our system and learned the identities of all our field agents.
around the world, our people are under attack.
our only lead is the maker of bomb KAOS used against us.
Ladislas Kistril
it's pronounce Krstic - Yes. Ladm. Kis - Cris-sic
Krimblins, yes.
he's a Bosnia national and one of KAOS" favorite munition suppliers.
unfortunately, we have no idea where he is.
actually sir we do. He is Russia.
how do you know that? - It's on Page 482 of my report.
does anybody read my reports?
all right, our mission is clear people, find Krinisnis - Krstic - Yes, find him - Krstic klingon fish... - Ok,
I got it, I got it.
used him to get to KAOS then recover the stolen nuclear material before they can do something less than friendly.
and maybe if we are lucky, we can apprehend the man behind it all
Siegfried, Pictured here with this No. 2 man Shtarker.
but Chief how are we gonna do that when all of our agents are already compromised?
put me out there, Chief. I'm not afraid to expose myself.
do you ever think before you speak?
no, I just whip it out there, for the best.
fortunately we have other options.
99 recently underwent massive plastic surgery on new faces not known yet.
we also have a new agent, agent 86.
who is that sir? - It's you Max.
Maxy!
you did it.
Lloyd, may I your receive your device please?
Ohaaa...I'm so happy. I'm so happy. This is the best day in my life.
Max, you didn't push the button hard enough.
so you can hear me? - Yes.
right.
excuse me, Chief, just a thought. I'm not questioning your judgment.
99. I insist on complete honesty.
if you have something to say to me. I wish you would just say it.
Max has no experience, and I don't want him as my partner.
well, that is a sucker punch to the gonads.
Hey, Max, we got you a lovely party gift for your first mission.
Oh. A pocket knife.
not just pocket knife, Swiss Army Knife.
comes with tweezers, pliers, tiny magnifying glass.
fish scaler, saw, flamethrower, chisel...
wow, what was that thing when you said two back? - Chisel - No. Before that, did you say flamethrower thrower? - Yeah. Check it.
Yeah, we also had a crossbow that fires harpoons connected to 60 feet spider-nano-thread
have the strength to have a steel cable
it's time-consume and weight-burnt technology - Spiders has to be individually milked - And they do not like it.
no. They don't
gentlemen, you're the best.

23 says that's important. Trust is a must.
that's what 23 says. - Does he?
you and I share a bond. I think.
we both know it feels like look in the mirror and not like what we see.
you with the surgery, me with weigh loss.
I wanna show you something.
that was me.
wow, impressive. Congratulations.
thank you.
well, this is me.
wow, very impressive 99.
you were truly hideous back then.
anyway, since we are going to portraying husband and wife.
maybe we should get our story set.
OK. Good idea.
we met in the marketing convention in Vegas.
married a year later. No kids. I like your parents.
but you hate mine. - So we want kids?
you do, but I'm concentrating on my career.
I don't know that's fair. I mean, I'm older that you are.
well, not that much - Really?
when they give me a new face, I have them take a couple years off.
you know why not?
no that's the case, you're at an advanced age.
you should... - No, I was never...
I'm just saying you eggs could dry up and fall off your uterus, So, time's the essence.
that's your opinion. - No that is a medical fact.
there's a lot of time for me to make this decision.
and I don't want to be rush into it by you or my mother.
you don't have to ... - Where is the damn drink cart?
what? - 6 o'clock.
don't turn around, don't turn around. Use your peripherals
do you see him?
I'm just widening my eyes. I'm not actually seeing anything more.
the big scary guy the way that while holding a sign "Hi, this is assassin and gonna kill you"
OK, 99, you know what? That is profiling. Just because he's large, - Doesn't necessarily mean that he is a bad guy. - Keep your voice down.
Oh. Wow - That's a bad guy. That's a really bad guy. - You're doing what I did.
did you see his face?
his head looks like an Easter Island heads.
you know what? I'm doing the same thing.
that's profiling. And I will not have none of it.
Oh. Damn it. Gum on my new shoes.
he's trying to light a shoe. - It's a shoe bomb. Get him.
it's gum.
is that a gun? - Gun?
not gun. No.
air Marshal, You're under arrest.
sir, I believe you just shattered my coccyx
folks, we will be experiencing a little turbulence, clasped the seat belts...

6 miles outside of Smolensk, Russia 1900 hours.
OK, not to keep dwelling on this. But that was some kiss.
how did you know that would work?
have you kissed other man who then plummeted into their death?
OK, ok, you know what, so far, our entire partnership has consist of me getting you out of trouble.
do you know why?
it is because you keep leading.
so here's how we stop that, I lead now.
I'm the one with field experience. And you know nothing.
I beg a differ. I looked up you field agent exam, - and I scored... - What?
your field agent exam. And I scored 8 points higher than you did.
this is not a classroom, this is real. You are really going to get us killed if you don't tries listening to me.
that's a difference between a A+ and A-. A-!
OK. Ok. You're faced with an assassin. What do you do?
I take out my gun, and I will shoot... - You don't have a gun.
I did until you took it. - Bang, you're dead.
no I'm not. - Bang, you're dead. You're dead.
stop shooting me.
I don't like it when you shoot me.
stop it. Stop shooting me more.
you already said it was... hey... - I brought you a manual,
I hear there're no grades there's only dead and not dead.
you know I'm not complete incompetent without a gun.
I'm a master in the art of Hwa Rang Do - I was not ready. - That's my point.
you know what? That... hey, what was that?
control 0930 hours
Max's half away to Moscow. Don't tell me you're still translating - ...that Russian chatter. - They talk fast, it's hard.
it's like eight of these morons will due one Max did.
I can't wait till we finish the Hymie new project.
all the stupid agents will be obsolete. bye-bye
what's a Hymie?
Hyper-Mechanical-Intelligent-Entity, Basically a robot.
it's a stolen KAOS technology. Be reprogrammed.
top secret. Need to know - And you don't need.
I'm a trained killer, you know. I can kill you with anything in this office.
you wanna die by posters? 'Coz I can make that happen.
and that's a slow death.
Larabee - Yes - were you the last one who used the copier? - Yes
you left it jammed.
so? Why don't you un-jam it?
just open the door, read instruction. - Is this a stapler?
Yeah. - Give you a show how to use it?
I want you to un-jam that.
23. - Yes.
have a moment please?
chief?
let me tell you a pattern that we getting remerged.
as a former field agent, I'm very much aware of how difficult it is to make transition to office life.
chief, he didn't un-jam the copier, and we have rules here, you know that.
if you don't follow the rules, then what are we?
I'll tell you what we're not.
we're not people who jam staple into other people's heads.
that's CIA crap. - All right, look, Chief,
I'm your best guy. I don't belong in an office making copies.
I should be out there with Max.
look, 23. No more stapling today
smolensk, Russia, 2300 hours.
so how do you know this place?
well, as an analyst, I'd like to keep my ears open.
it's amazing what you can learn listening the chatter.
in fact, Ladislas Krstic, loves this place. As to many KAOS agents.
coffee Minsk Pinsk in Smolensk
it doesn't get any better than this-sk
see what I just did? I add an - insk at the end of the word made it a Russian.
see that make you harder.
is that your default setting?
do you just punch people in the face really annoying?
it's Tuesday, I'll punch Max in the face.
Oh, a box of kittens, time to punch Max in the face.
Oh, I may need some bread. Time to punch Max in the face.
you know, I love bread. And I know bread have a few carbos
but I never really been afraid of carbos
because it seems like no matter how many I eat, I stay thin-sk.
how's work? I hear your friends are moving a lot more than dynamite these days.
Oh, I'm sorry, are you talking to me? No speak-insky Russian.
Yankee assholes - I hate them.
how did the job in Chechnya go?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
maybe next time I could help?
just let me know. I'm good with a gun.
you know, you talk too much.
boy, you know what? I'm going to tell you I love your country.
no more Communism. No rules of any kind, really.
I'm filling my suitcase with steroids and art from ancient Mesopotamia. Run over an old woman yesterday.
best vacation I've ever had.
time to take my pill.
there was a guy in the bathroom who is really hot.
Really? - No, no, no, radioactive hot.
Yes, he did have a certain rugged quality that someone find appealing.
how did you know he was radioactive?
my watch the Geiger counter. You don't have any of these?
listen, I think he's the part of the nuclear thief in Chechnya, we should follow him.
I gotta say, Max, you pick a good restaurant.
of course. Tripe soup. This must be Ladislas Krstic's house.
what?
tripe soup. His favorite dish. It was in the mission dossier.
let's just see we're up against, OK.
I didn't get eat at the restaurant.
and if you skip the meal, the next meal you're over indulged.
Oh let me get the meals - It's the recipe for...
you owe me 3 dollars.
Oh more guards, we'll have to figure out a way in.
Mini-sh blowgun, you don't have one of these?
these darts are tips to the protein tranquilizer draw from a skin of Amazonian lizard known as Losabuttles Dilanwasde. "The shoots of death."
excuse me.
there're 40 yards now, darts suffer at the edge of my range. I'm going to have to give this one a little something extra.
you look spectacular. - Thanks you don't look too bad yourself.
is that a wig - Yeah, I came with dress.
how do I get into these clothes?
that's not important, let's go.
am I wearing boxers?
for future reference, I usually prefer briefs for the security, and piece of mine going free-bird is not exactly ideal.
I don't like it.
there must be 200 people here. Finding Krstic would be like find a needle in a haystack
Hello, welcome to my party.
my name is Ladislas Krstic.
I wounder if you like to dance with me?
I would love to dance.
you understand Russian, very impressive.
shall we?
I hope your date doesn't mind.
Oh. He's not my date. He's just a local horse girl I hire to drive me around.
it's a tragic story. He's quite deaf, wittily not right.
I am going to dance now.
you go get yourself some punch.
OK.
I don't even know how much he gets to - Chief, I need your help. - You're on. Go ahead.
I've searched most of his house. But I cannot find his computer network.
get me an infrared satellite scan. I've to get back to 99. She's in great danger.
your house is so beautiful. It must be difficult to go to work.
I don't have to go very far.
excuse me, would you like to dance?
I don't think so.
I wasn't talking to you.
me? - Da.
I don't know. - It'll be fun.
trust me.
you're so light on your feet. - Ever since I lost 150 pounds.
so did I.
isn't it great? I've some more energy now.
me too - Thanks for jumping - No problem
thank you for the lovely dance.
did you see anything while I was dancing?
just once. I don't think you're expected him to lift you so high
anyway, I find that the office's in the guest house.
Oh, really?
how did you do that? Show him a little "Declodhash-no-Clivige"? Bet your eyes?
not judging. Just a second pattern here. - Ready to work?
I'm ready to work. You're ready to work?
you just having fun show your....
six guards. We're going to need another way in.
stay by, Max. Larabee, let's go. Move it.
Hey, what did you do?
I can't find the right screen. It was just here a second ago. Then I hit a button and then it went way.
what button did you hit? - Don't yelling me, it's really not helping.
if you don't find that screen, Mr. Larabee, I'm gonna have you hunting for landmines with a hammer!
got it Max, there's one other entrance.
what kind of entrance?
the kind where you gonna throw your shoes out afterwards.
Oh, great. Rats. Not enough there's poop.
you know what? I never saw James Bond in rats" foul cove. A lot of rats in poop.
Oh, look, a rat riding on a piece of poop.
stop it. It's just a storm drain.
here it is.
explosive dental floss. You don't have this?
great
come on.
are you staring at my butt?
no, I'm not. I might have been before.
I'm now again. All right, I'm stopping.
just pay attention to what I'm doing so that follow me exactly - Yep
OK, Max, little heads up, these are high intensity laser so whatever part of you does touch gets sliced off.
one more reason why boxer were a bad idea.
all right, so do I have do exactly like that?
Just...come
Max, impressive.
careful, getting off this is tricky.
good, very good.
OK, it's not that good.
Max, Max, stay calm.
Max, keep it down. Keep it together
that's not cheese.
Max, be quiet!
OK, shall we?
did I hear something?
there were something tap dancers in the hallway.
damn it. Can't get into their system. Biometric security
if you don't mind, 99
the old "steam from your breath takes to everything that oil from the last thumb print" trick. Here we go.
shipment are explosives.
your boyfriend is a very bad man. - And really good kisser.
ignoring that.
I wouldn't have shipped detonators. It's a lot of what you saying.
well, he is a bomb maker.
no, no, no, what is odd is that it'd ship to a bakery In Moscow
these detonators could also be used for nuclear bombs. I think this is our connection to KAOS.
I set that up.
let her go.
I'm not totally incompetent without a gun, you know
thanks for the help
that's enough.
pity, I'm about to shoot a beautiful women and her retard stable boy, and yet, I will sleep like a baby.
not bad for rookie. - Not a bad one for an old lady.
KAOS headquarters 0917 hours.
Siegfried here.
how could you possibly screw this up? - Krstic was a fool.
and they got lucky - Who's that? Who's speaking?
it's no one, sir.
they're heading towards you. Don't disappoint me again. - Don't worry, sir. They won't get pass...
why did he do that? - Don't look at me. I'm no one.
and don't you forget, everyone here can be replaced. I even have backup for you.
it's called rhinoceros 147 miles outside of Moscow 1100 hours.
I think it's time to find a new vehicle. Pull over.
I feel good about the mission so far. Don't you?
so far, sure
I think we worked very well together. Like in the mansion, the way I held that guy's hair and you punch him in the throat?
that was...that was nice. - Nice?
Yeah, well, good teamwork. - What are you doing?
I'm just saying that I think we're very compatible.
I think that you're confusing at adrenalin with, I don't know, - some other kind of hormone - Oh, no, no, no. No. That's...
Oh, Max, stop it.
Hey, let me give you a lesson that I have to learn the hard way.
you can't trust anyone out here, not even me.
I mean, you know, I could be a double agent.
break-in CONTROL that probably's an inside job.
and it happens as I got back. How do you that it wasn't me?
what are we talking about here? - Let's just find a car.
which one's gonna attract the least attention?
all right , we have a couple of Soviet era sedans here.
we have that tractor. That cart.
and that'll work. - No.
Yes.
no.
yes - Oh, yeah, we really under the radar now. - Will you relax?
this is fallen Communism. Everybody has one of these here.
holy shit, a Ferrari.
Iljubjashhijjon Bakery, Moscow, 2100 hours
there's a little KAOS Bakery. And I'm sure I don't have to remind you, but this isn't technically alike the last place. There's no party, there's no dancing.
everyone in there is a trained killer, do you understand? OK.
did they explain to you how your belt clamp works?
no, but that technology for holding up the pants doesn't change that much.
Max - Hey, what?
this one has a compartment, Inside, there's a pill
if captured, it will cause death in 9 seconds.
great. But how exactly do I get them to take it?
not much of a laugher, are you?
here, put this on. - On what?
on your molar. It's a tooth radio. It sends and receives sound up to your jaw to your interior ear. But I can't hear outside your mouth, so if you get in trouble, you have to say so.
is it working? - Damn it - Is it working? - Yes.
good.
OK. Well, you know what to do? Good luck in there.
you too.
free Rugelach? - No thank you, I'm here for something else.
bread?
something hot. - We have rolls that just came out.
even hotter. Much much hotter.
I already have boyfriend - Although I could make exception. - No. that's...
sure? Flour sacks in bed very comfortable.
I don't think we are on the same page.
I'm here because Ladislas Krstic sent me
take number.
but I'm the only one here.
Oh.
who are you?
my name is Nudnick Spilks, who are you?
I'm Siegfried. - Did you say Siegfried?
Yes.
I understand that you're the man to see if someone interested inquire an item of a nuclear nature.
how do I know you're not CONTROL? - If I were CONTROL, you'd already be dead.
if you were CONTROL, you'd already be dead.
well, neither of us is dead. So I'm obviously not from control.
that actually make sense.
follow me, Mr. Spilks
test, test
ahh, the Ode to Joy from Beethoven's Ninth.
stone deaf when he wrote it. Syphilous. fun stuff.
Yeah, it's a personal favorite. A bit familiar, for it ends with a bang.
you're doing great, Max.
what about to show you is the inner sanctum of our entire operation.
the inner sanctum of the entire operation?
Yes.
this is it? - Of course not. I lied.
he does that.
I'm going to kill you. And I'm going your partner.
I don't know who you're talking about.
Mrs. Spilks must be lost.
I think it's only fair to warn you, this facility is surrounded by a highly trained team of 130 black op snipers.
I don't believe you.
would you believe two dozen Delta Force Commandos?
no.
how about Chuck Norris with a BB gun?
goodbye Mr. Smart.
well, Mr. Shtarker, I think you have underestimated me and the element of the surprise 99, we have been compromised. Get out.
Max, where are you?
99, I've found the yellow cake. - Of course you did. It's a bakery.
no. Not "yellow cake" cake. Yellow cake Uranium.
although there is "yellow cake" cake here as well.
Oh Max.
Max, do you realize...? I've lost your signal. - 99
I swallow it. I can get it back to you, but you may not want it.
good lord.
listen. I have placed charges at key struts points all over the building.
what? Max, you can't blow up a building full of radioactive material
I know that, 99. I've placed all enough charges to safely bury the weapon's lab.
Max, that's brilliant.
wow, that's maybe the nicest thing you ever say to me.
I don't get it, I thought he was dead.
I will say this: it is now quick
this is just ridiculous.
99. wake up 99, maybe you should kiss him again.
you die now
I know that voice.
the chatter. Dalip
I know you!
that was me.
Max? - I'm sorr...yes, still fighting.
Dalip, I can prove that I know you. Your favorite is chicken tikka.
like me, you enjoy American top 40 with Ryan Seacrest.
wait, wait, there's something else that I know.
Max ...
your marriage is in trouble. Your darling wife's Sinat, is leaving you.
but there's still hope. Do you love her?
what?
then show her. Go home for lunch.
take her with you if you're going to kill someone.
she just wants to be with. And frankly, that's mean less time with her sister who we both know is undermining your relationship.
kick the gun to me. - 99, please.
big people feel pain, too.
what are you doing
Oh, no.
OK.
OK, OK
that's all right.
her sister is just such a bitch.
are you all right. - Yes
that was amazing.
thank you
we gotta go - What was that? - I drummed up.
climb up, climb up.
good idea. We will come up with you and we'll go together.
see, Mom? Surround sound kicks ass - it's like right in the room!
he left us here. What a douche.
missed it by that much.
well, that's convenient. Shoot them
whatever you do, don't look down. I'm gonna try to get us over that latch - Max - We can do this, 99
Max - Right
Oh, thanks Chief. Ok. No problem.
the Chief is thrilled. He sent 23 out to verify and clean up.
great.
listen, is it possible that you could answer a personal question?
is it possible?
why did you change your looks?
Oh, that's not really a personal question.
things from my non-work sphere spill into my work sphere.
facts became known, identities were compromised and I become a brunette
wow, that is a great story in which you reveal absolutely nothing about yourself.
I blew a mission.
I was involved someone from work. I lost focus.
the mission blew up. I broke up from that person, but my identity had already been revealed.
so, I had two choices. Either I could other spend the rest of my life behind a death, which would like 8 hours a day of scraping cheese grater against my forehead, - you know. - Yes
or, I could change my face. So that's what I did.
and it was painful.
but it needed to done.
don't wanna talk about this anymore. - OK.
I used to look like my mom.
I used to look like two of my moms put together.
moskva River 0200 hours
sir, if I may ask,
how do you choose the target? Why Los Angeles?
major city, lots of media attention.
and the president will be there.
still, it's too bad about all the movie stars.
Yes. What will we do without their razor-sharp political advice?
Oh my god, have you eaten the crew?
Oh, look, it understands. Get back to work.
moscow 0700 hours.
you know that's not possible.
no, no, no...Max...
no. but it doesn't make any sense.
yellow cake Uranium warheads, the entire production line?
there's nothing here but what used to be bakery.
are you telling me there're no weapons? That there's no radio activity of a very kind?
nothing. I swept the entire area and it's clean - But Max said he see... - Did you see the evidence yourself?
no. Every time he found something he was alone.
OK, what do you want me to do with Max? - Do with Max?
you were right when you said I shouldn't trust you.
give me the phone.
and who might this be? Siegfried?
Hello, Max. - Chief?
knock out gas, 99? Please, I've trained my body to be impervious to ...that's a new stuff.
Oh, Max.
washington, DC 0730 hours.
I'm very disappoint at you Max.
I thought you and I were supposed to be cut from the same cloth.
chief, we are. How can you think that I'm a double agent?
you lied about finding evidence and radioactivity.
you conveniently kill Krstic before anybody can question it.
I know a little matter of you shoving my head with fire extinguisher.
I said I was sorry. You just didn't hear me because you're in a mini-coma.
you made CONTROL a laughing stock
the Vice President wants to shut us down, you know.
99, This whole week, last night, - you know me. - Apparently not.
Oh my god, you two? You and Max?
you said we have to break up 'coz we have to work together.
Oh my god. You and 23? I'm so sexually threatened right now.
you have reached the United State department Homeland Security.
for threats against the continental of the United States, Press 1.
for threats against Hawaii, Press 2
for threats against Puerto Rico...
you know, you are the human being I know who snores when he is awake.
OK. Today is threat assessment
homeland Security briefing 1000 hours.
there're 72 threats on the list. Mike?
thank you Mr. Vice President.
OK. We have a deteriorating situation in Venezuela.
we have a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan - What about the deteriorating situation in North Korea?
I was getting to that. - When? Next week?
Yes. Next Tuesday. Right after I kick you ass.
gentlemen, when we argue, the terrorists win.
anyway, last night in private dinner, President Kim Jong Il made a very odd threat, too. And I quote:
make a pudding from the bones of Americans - Oh, that guy's insane.
does he know bones are crunchy? Who wants a crunchy pudding?
war Room
finally. My name is Siegfried, and I represent KAOS.
over the past few months, we have assembled a stock pile of nuclear weapons.
which we have distributed to 20 unfriendly unstable dictators,
for the moment KAOS retains the bombing actuation code
but we will release the codes unless our demands are met.
what are your demands? - 200 billion dollars by 3pm - 200 billion dollars by 3pm - You seem a bit slow - Is there someone else I can talk to ? - Good one
look, Siegfried, we don't negotiate with terrorists, and you're obviously bluffing. Take a hike.
what are you doing? Are you kidding me?
you spent half the morning talking about crunching pudding.
and you ignore credible threat?
credible? come on, KAOS hadn't been functioned for 20 years.
with all do respects, the CIA knows nothing about KAOS.
control has to be in charge here.
like when you bomb that bakery?
muffins of mass destruction.
that's it; I've been waiting for this since Nixon
here we go.
I got a new pacemaker. I can go all day.
OK. OK! - Come on!
it seems like they don't believe you.
which is why we'll be arrange for a little demonstration.
control holding cell 1400 hours
chief, you wanted to see me?
Yes, you and 23 are coming with me to the see the President. - Can't you just calling?
vice President won't let me through, can't believe we have to go all the way to Los Angles.
why is the President that never here?
sir, I'm sure whatever he's doing is vital to the nation
good night, moon.
good night cow jumped over the moon.
actually, I think you'd suck as my teacher.
well, from what?
Hey, Smart, Happy birthday
I'm fat
gentlemen
Oh, good. The itchy kind. My favorite
is this one also have smallpox?
and that was a human tooth.
american top 40. which Ryan Seacrest
here's sweet dedication from a little lady named Dalip. Still for her boyfriend Max, "meet me in LA. Things will be very hot." "Nuclear hot."
I don't know, if I were Max, I would get myself to LA.
Hey, dumb guards, why don't you come in here, so I can make you my pretty little girl friends?
you'll have to shower for weeks!
but you will never get the smell off. You two seem very angry.
thank you, sir. May I have another?
I was kidding.
turn around slowly
guys, you have to believe me. I'm not a double agent.
we never thought you were. - Yeah, we love you man.
then what's with the firearm and the freak show expressions?
the security cameras, if it looks like we let you go, we two get fired.
got it.
so, where's the Chief and 99? - They flew to LA to talk to the President.
I need to get out here before someone else come to stop me.
I suggest you overpower us.
good idea. Bruce, I will smash you in the face. - Thank you.
Lloyd, I will simulate you're disenablement . ready? One.
not yet. I haven't punch you yet. Wait until I punch you.
sorry.
wrong way. - Wait, - you should know sometimes I faint. - I'm not actually going to hit you.
no, but when I see blood, or when I talk blood, - There will be no blood - Or think about blood. - Hang in there, hang in there. Hang in buddy.
what are you doing, dumb? 'coz running out in the middle of the road, you can get hit by a car.
well, that was ironic.
chief, I'm not buying it. With all our satellites, there's no way anybody could possibly have nuclear bombs that we wouldn't know about.
nuclear. What's that? -Sorry.
Mr. President, if I could please show you some data?
just...just back up here a second. First thing I'd like to know is what would the Vice President say about this?
I'm afraid the Vice President I had a less than cordial encounter, so...
less than cordial you say? - Yes, sir.
Oh.
chairman of Joint Chief; see he sends us a little movie here.
put right here on my cell phone. You are ready to share me this with you here? This is my favorite part here.
I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day.
Oh, Chief. - Very sweet tackle.
look, look at this surprise on his face.
I probably owe you an apology for that sir, - No, no, no, please, just save your breath.
but I have to agree that son of a bitch. We cannot respone to every threat.
case closed.
Max? - Hello, 99
trace 99"s call, now! - Where are you?
that's not important. What is important is that KAOS has planted a bomb - Somewhere in Los Angeles. - We got him. He is still in Washington.
listen, while I was in my cell, I have some time to think.
I realized that even though I was accused to something that I didn't do,
I was happy. Because at least for a little while, I got to live with my dream of being an agent.
and I got to be with you. I learned you, a mean right cross.
you're almost as good a dancer as me.
and you used to look like your mom.
Max
please, 99, all I'm asking is for you to look me in the eyes and tell me that you don't feel something, too.
freeze.
Oh, Max, how can I look in your eyes? - Just turn around.
why are you talking to your shoe?
the old "call forwarding from the shoe phone to the cell phone so you don't know where I am, then I appear on the roof behind you, and surprise everyone" trick - Don't move. - Max, what are you doing?
how did you get here?
dude, you don't wanna have one of these.
it doesn't matter. What matters is that there's a bomb, and I'm here to help you find it.
how do you know this?
I'd rather not say.
Max, there're millions of lives at stake. If you have credible from a reliable source, I wanna know it, and I wanna know it now.
I heard it from American sweet heart Ryan Seacrest
come on.
it was coded message. - Max, we're running out time here, what are you talking about?
I received a tip from a KAOS agent who I befriended at the bakery.
I think we should trust him Chief. - Oh, absolutely, Chief. I'm with 99 on that one.
every time I look in Max's puppy eyes, I'm gone.
Oh my god. You've really never had one break up with you, have you?
chief, you said that you and I are alike.
that we're both old-fashion men. Rely on an old-fashioned hunch.
I have a hunch that you have a hunch. And I am telling the truth.
Max
any double agent escape from a high security holding situation, only to fall right back into the hands of the people they got him in the first place, is either an idiot or not a double agent. And I don't think you are an idiot.
thank you Chief.
now, we know that the President is in town, but what exactly is he doing here today?
Max? - Yes. We need to find his exact itinerary.
but Max - I know, I know 99, I need to go get a paper.
disney Hall, Los Angeles, CA, 1630 hours - We're in position, more or less. - Roger.
I have the whole security system online, just remember....
Yes, we know, how about the little radio silence.
I wanna quit but what can I do. He's married to my sister.
Oh, by the way, I review the security tapes from the explosion at the bakery, and I know that you let those CONTROL agents get away.
so unless you do your job today, your lovely wife Sinat will have eaten her last kebab.

we need to get everyone out and shut this place down.
we swept the building. It's fine. The secret service doesn't make mistakes like the fabulous bakery boys.
who told you about that? Who told you about that?
Hey, take it easy, old timer. You gonna give yourself a heart-attack, and in this state, will not include me blow air into your mouth.
Hey, you wanna a piece of me? You wanna a piece of me? - Chief, it's not working, it's not working.
I'm shaking, I'm shaking.
you better watch it.

I just got back from Russia. A lot of people there are radioactive.
the bakery. You said you swept the whole area, that everything was clean.
I did. And it was. - Really?
was anyone else there? Do we just have to trust you ?
23, your knife wound is seepy. Sudden rise in blood pressure?
perhaps you're nervous. Nervous because there is a bomb here, and you know it.
and what is with the briefcase? Could that actually be the football?
to by football, you mean a computer containing the bomb activation codes?
that is exactly what I mean. I'm not interested in a real football unless it's assign by Joe Montana.
and I don't believe that is the case here.
well, 23?
you know what? We're out of time.
you follow us, she dies.
stop this car.
Max, you idiot, what the hell is wrong with you?
you don't just slap your hands on a government vehicle.
Hey, that's it, when we go back to Washington? You morons are through!
damn it! How did you got away from this so long.
I can't believe none of us saw especially me.
don't beat yourself up. We'll be dead soon anyway.
chief, he's heading south on Grand - Thanks Bruce, keep us close
Hey, CONTROL asshole, you just stole my vehicle. I know you're listening.
you two dick-wards, watch for scratch on that car.
what was that? - Sorry, I'm losing you.
what the...?
come on, fellows, 20 dollars who hit the car.
chief, I have to say, this whole thing really steam my clams - I cannot get over the fact that 23 is a traitor - Sand trap.
now I know how you must have felt you thought I was the traitor, it's demoralizing.
tractor.
I don't how I missed it. I'm usually very observant.
toy fish

I don't know. Were you thinking "holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, the sword fish almost went through my head"?
if So? Yes.
come on.
on behalf the Unite States" Government, I hereby commandeer this plane.
the devices are armed. I hope you're moving.
don't worry sir, I'll be well clear.
chief, they are headed south down on I-47

I need to get down to that car. - No good.
if I get too low, he'll hear me coming.
I have another idea.
what are you doing?
get back in the plane, you gonna kill yourself up here.
hang on
hang on. We are doing good.
sorry, Max.
tuesday is not gonna work. Cannot do Tuesday. - Mom! Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom!
Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean! You see how annoying that is?
see, this is your problem. Some man like when women were feminine.
well, I'm not feminine - No...
I'm not feminine?!
Freeze!
that was so cool
damn, what the hell. CABLE RELEASE
you know it might be more help if you untie me
there's a knife in my right front pocket.
stop it, stop it, stop it. What?
that's not my knife, that's...
I got it. - 99 don't touch that.
Oh my lord.
Max, hurry.
hold on, 99
chief, we can't stop the car. We have the football but we do not know the code.
we have to figure out something soon, he's trying to take us back downtown where's the bomb
gotta get you out of there. You won't survive to jump. I'm coming to get you.
Oh god - Hold on 99
it's not over, Max. I'll take that briefcase.
if you want it, you'll have to take it. - That's what I just said.
I know, I'm just trying to annoy you.
unusual, but effective.
are you all right? - I'm fine.
Max Max. You foot.
I wish we had more time. - What?
Max!
Oh, Max
I wish we had more time too
so you did hear me.
Max
but...
the train.
missed it by that much.
operation Joy?
the Ode To Joy will end with a bang.
chief? - Yeah, Maxy, are you OK?
listen, I think the final notes of the Ode To Joy trigger the bomb.
we have to stop the concert. - I'm on it.
my butts are really sings for being dragged
grandpa, I already told you...
speak up, son, I'm an old man, you know
I like that tangly part.
I'm so, so sorry about that.
wait, wait let him go.
there's a bomb. - Where?
would you believe in the piano?
well, how do we missed that?
Max, what was that? - A total guess. Yes it was.
that old son can take it in.
you think I should tell him?
no, let's just save him the moment.
he's a funny son of bitch, isn't he?
this is the proudest day of my life.
bomb not gone off - Oh really bright eyes?
what alerted you? - Was is no boo-boo or the lack of mushroom cloud?
it was the mushroom cloud for me.
well, you did your job.
so I suppose I can't kill your wife.
but be honesty, I'll be doing the sighted world a favor.
what good hang time, huh?
Yes, Mr. President, thank you, good bye, sir.
86, the President wanted to convey a personal thanks.
and to tell you how enormously impressed he was with that old-drag-by-a-train thing.
well, sir, as an agent I've trained myself to be impervious to pain.
hey...it's pain... - I wanted him to be a surprise.
99, please, nobody here knows that we're dating.
Yes, they do.
on the cheek.
give me a little one.
Hi, new guy. Hold up a second, welcome to CONTROL.
we have a tradition here it's called pick on the new guy here's how it works. We pick on the new guy
and you can't do anything about it.
let's try one.
you dropped you pencil.

I don't see a man, I see two little girls.
I think that'll call you Marie and you Britney.
new guy did not.
new guy did.
OK, new guy, I got this.

but I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
he doesn't know I'm here.
that's not a very promising start.
no. My husband has seen everyone to no avail. He's given up hope.
he hasn't seen me.
you're awfully sure of yourself.
I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
of course, he wants to be cured.
my husband is required to speak publicly.
perhaps he should change jobs.

good afternoon

I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
forgive me, your Royal...? - Highness.
your Royal Highness.
johnson was used during the Great War when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know 'he" was aboard.
am I considered the enemy?
you will be if you remain un-obliging.
you'll appreciate the need for absolutely discretion
of course.
how did you find me? Your Royal Highness
the President of the Society for Speech Therapists
Eileen McCleod? She's a sport.
she warned me your antipodean methods were "unorthodox and controversial."
I warned her...they were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
but for my method to work
I need trust and total equality here in the safety of my consultation room.
no exceptions.
well then, in that case...
when can you start?
still sounds a bit rough.
you make me drive too slowly, Dad!
did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
may I be please leave the table?
how special is special?
you must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents" inane conversation.
Thanks, dad!
and mum. - And mum!
me too - You're meeting Jean?
no, someone else
doctor? Doctor? Don't you help your brother with the washing up
I'm fine
who is it Lionel?
why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
myrtle, just a woman looking to help her husband.
and I had a 'call." For an audition - One of my favourates.- Aren't they all.
could be a lot of fun - I'm sure you'll be splendid
in the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded group
from Putney.
that's all girls. Tomorrow, Chapter 4, The Flight - I long to know they fly to - I can't wait
Oh, to fly away!
weren't they lucky!
now Papa tell a story!
could I be a penguin instead?
now I want to a penguin story.
very quickly
once there were two princesses
princesses Elisabeth, and Princesses Margret
their papa was a penguin
this was because he been turned into by a wicked witch
this was inconvenient for him because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms and you can't do that if you're a penguin, because you have wings like herrings.
herrings don't have wings.
penguins have wings which like the shape of herrings.
and what make matters worse she sent him to the South Pole which is an awfully long walk back if you can't fly.
when he reached the water
he dived in, through the depth so fast that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.
from there he took the 2. 30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
he swam up the Thames and out through the plughole, giving the cook mama and Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
when the girls heard all the commotion
they run to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him guess what he turned into?
a handsome prince!
a short-tailed Albatross.
with wings big enough that he could wrap them both around his two girls together
now girls, time for bed. Come on
take the horses to the stable
you have exactly a minute
good night， feed them brush them and to bed.
will Mrs Simpson be there?
my brother's insisting.
is he serious?
about our coming to dinner?
no. About her!
a married woman? He can't be.
she can. By the way， I think I found someone rather interesting.
on Harley Street. A doctor.
out of the question. I'm not having this conversation again.
the matter's settled.
his approach seems rather different...
now?
now!
"now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of York."
"and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
thank you.
lovely diction, Mr...
Logue. Lionel Logue.
well, Mr Logue,
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
Sydney? - Perth.
major theater town, is it? - Enthusiastic.
Ah. - I was well reviewed.
Yes...well...Lionel,
I think our dramatic society is looking for someone slightly younger and a little more regal.
you have to shut that one first.
close that one first, that
where did you find this...physician?
classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market."
he comes highly recommended.
charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh， dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!
he has no receptionist. He likes to keep things simple.
the Johnsons.
you can go in now, "Mr. Johnson."
Lionel says...wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
or, it being a p-pleasant day, p-perhaps take a stroll.
was that alright...Lionel?
marvellous, Willy
you can stay here and wait for your mum.
Mrs Johnson. Mr. Johnson, do come in.
would you like a sweetie
he's a good lad, Willy.
he could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
my boys made those. Good, aren't they.
please, make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
when speaking with a prince, one waits for the prince to choose the topic.
waiting for me to... commence a conversation one can wait a rather long wait.
do you know any jokes?
timing isn't my strong suit.
cuppa tea?
no thank you.
I think I'll have one.
aren't you going to start treating me，Dr Logue?
only if you're interested in being treated.
please, call me Lionel.
I... I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel. What'll I call you?
your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
a bit formal for here. I prefer names
prince Albert Frederick Arthur George?
how about Bertie?
only my family uses that.
perfect. In here, it's better if we're equals.
if we were equal. I wouldn't be here.
I'd be. at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
please don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
my physicians say it relaxes the throat.
they're idiots.
they've all been knighted.
makes it official then.
my "castle," my rules.
thank you
what was your earliest memory?
what an earth do you mean?
your first recollection.
I'm not...
here to discuss personal matters.
Why're you here then?
because I bloody well stammer!
you have a bit of a temper.
one of my many faults.
when did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
don't. tell me! It's my stammer!
it's my field. I assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
when did it start?
four or five.
that's typical.
so I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that. Do you hesitate when you think?
don't be ridiculous.
how about when you talk to yourself?
everyone natters occasionally, Bertie.
stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
then we shan't speak!
are you charging for this, Doctor?
a fortune.
I'll just save that brew
so, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
of course not!
that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
what do you think was the cause?
I don't know! I... don't care!
I stammer. And no one can fix it.
I'll bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
and if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
and if I win?
you don't have to answer them.
one usually... wagers money.
a bob each to keep it sweet? Let's see your shilling.
I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you. And you can pay me back next time.
if there is a next time.
I haven't agreed to take you on yet
so please stand, and take a look at that, from there
I can't read this.
then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
"To... to...be or not to be,
that... is." Damn
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice
and then play it back to you on the same machine.
this is brilliant. It's the latest thing from America: a Silvertone.
pop these on?
there's a bob in this, mate. You can go home rich!
you're playing music. - I know.
how can I hear what I'm saying?!
surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
you're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
hopeless. Hopeless!
you were sublime.
would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
let me play it back to you - No.
alright then, I'll get to ask you the questions.
thank you Doctor, I don't... feel this is for me.
thank you for your time. Bye
sir?
the recording is free.
please keep it as a souvenir?
no
ah well.
bugger
for the present the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility...
...within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.
to all, to each, I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
and off air
easy when you know how.
sir?
have a go yourself.
congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr Wood. Splendid fellow.
chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
sir.
thank you.
sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare its quare in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
show who's in command.
Papa I don't...think I read this
this devilish device will change everything if you won't.
in the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
this family has been reduced to those lowest beast of all creatures...we've become...actors!
we're not a family, we're a firm.
yet any moment some of us may be out of work.
your darling brother... and future king
the only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
he's broken off with Lady Furness.
and taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight no divorced person can ever be received at court.
he said she made him sublimely happy.
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word" this is what he said "I give you my word, we've never had immoral relations,"
stared square into his father's eyes...
and lied.
when I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe,
Marshall Stalin the other half?
who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss? You?
with your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
have a go yourself.
Through.the... one of the m

lying bastard.
you're playing music. - I know.
how can I hear what I'm saying?!
surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
you're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
"to be, or not to be, - that is the question:
..."whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
and by opposing end them.
to die, to sleep no more
and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to? 'tis a consummation..."
hopeless! Hopeless!
strictly business. No. personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
got the shilling you owe me?
No， I haven't
didn't think so.
besides, you...tricked me!
physical exercises and tricks are important
but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
is that that's sufficient? Ah, no.
as far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
maybe just deal with that.
I.I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
Lionel.
are you... willing to do your part?
alright. You want mechanics?
we need to relax your jaw muscles and strengthen your tongue.
by repeating tongue twisters， for example.
"I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
because I am a thistle sifter."
fine.
you do have a flabby tummy,
we'll need to spend some time strength in your diaphragm.
simple mechanics.
that is all we ask.
and that's about a shilling's worth.
forget about the blessed shilling!
perhaps, upon occasion,
you might be request to assistance...
in coping with...some minor event.
will that be agreeable?
of course.
that will be the full extent of your services.
shall I see you next week?
I shall see you every day.

take a nice deep breath, expand the chest

how do you feel?
full of hot air.
isn't that what public speaking is all about?
my wife and I are glad to visit this important...
take a good deep breathe, and up come。 your Royal Highness
and slowly exhale and down come， your Royal Highness - are you alright, Bertie? - yes， this is actually quite good fun.

sandringham Estate 1936
Hello, Bertie. - Hello David - I see you've been coming out - Not at all
been waiting long? For Christ, bloody freezing
Where've you been?
been busy.
so was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry. She'll recover.
father won't.
I'll drive.
old bugger's doing this on purpose.
dying?
departing prematurely to complicate matters with Wallis.
Oh， for heaven's sake, David.
you know how long he's been ill.
wallis explained. She's terribly clever about these things.
... whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912
his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian, - what's going on here? - Custos Regni, in the form of Councilors of State.
I cannot follow you. I'm confused and I don't understand - ... what you're taking about - It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
would you do that? - So we may act on your behalf.
not clearly I'm afraid...I'm still confused...
but Approved. Thank you.
let me help you， sir - all right - thank you sir - thank you
feeling a little better, Sir?
no. I'm not feeling any better. I feel dreadful.
been ice-skating?
no, George.
Yes, he's alright. Of course.
I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately.
David, the dinner - I'm on with Wallis
it's Bertie.
no, it's not important. No. I don't want to
no, telephone me later? Right, bye
wallis misses me terribly.
mama says you're late for dinner.
she forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
how is the king? I hope he is not in pain.
no, no, His Majesty is quieter now.
thank you
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
none of this.unpleasantness would be tolerated
you know， Sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father
both in outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest to present it in a most favorable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I'm fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
please continue, thank you， just commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
what on earth was that?
poor Wallis. Now I'm trapped!
and in these last 25 crowded troubled glorious years
if there's one thing that King George has taught
it is the art of the leader with also a brother to his followers
as long as he lives he was the guiding star of a great nation
dad?
time for a Shake, dad?
you sure? - Go on
put your thinking caps on.
bet its the Scottish Play.
no, I bet it's Othello. It's always Othello.
"art thou afeard? Be not afeard"
Caliban! - Oh! For heaven's sake. that was a lucky guess!
don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.
the isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments
will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,
that, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again:"
alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
."and then, in dreaming, Me thought the clouds" - the clouds me thought "The clouds me thought would open,
and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that...
...when I waked, I cried to dream again."
it's such a sad thought.
my next patient must be a bit early. You better go lads, I'm sorry.
won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie, they told me not to expect you.
sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude.
No.Not at all, please come in
I've been practising. One hour a day.
in spite of everything.
what's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
do you feel like working today?
a Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
what did you father do? - He was brewer.
Oh. - At least there was free beer.
here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact, my father's ...last words were:
"Bertie has more. guts than the rest of his brothers. put together."
he couldn't say that to my face.
my brother.
what about him?
try singing it. - I'm sorry?
what songs do you know?
songs? - "Swanee River"
I love that song. - Happens to be my favorite.
sing me the chorus. - No. Certainly not.
I always. wanted to build models.
father... wouldn't allow it. He. collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.
you can finish that off. If you sing.
"my brother David, doo-dah" - I'm not going to sit here wobbling
you can with me.
because... you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
rules are rules
I'm not...crooning "Swanee River!"
try "Camptown Races" then.
"my brother David, he said to me, doodah doo-dah..."
continuous sound will give you flow. - No
does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
tell you the truth, It was a relief...
knowing. I wouldn't be .King.
but unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
and your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"you're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor."
"Lionel," You didn't stammer.
of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
your boy wouldn't mind? - No, not at all
david and I were very close.
young bucks... You know.
did you chase the same girls?
david was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
we shared... the expert ministrations of "Paulette" in Paris.
not at the same time of course.
did David ever tease you?
Oh ，yes， they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie."
father encouraged it.
"get it out, boy!"
said it would make me stop.
said..."I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me."
are you naturally right handed?
left. I was... punished. Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
anything other corrections?
knock knees.
metal... splints were made...worn...day and night
that must have been painful.
bloody agony. Straight legs now.
who were you closest to in your family?
nannies. Not my first nanny.
she loved David...hated me.
when I. was presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd...She pinch me so I'd cry, and be...handed back to her immediately, then she wouldn't...
sing it - then she wouldn't feed me, far far away."
took my parents three years to notice.
as you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems. Still.
what about your brother Johnnie?
were you close to him?
Johnnie, Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and...he was 'different'.
he died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
do you want a top-up? - Please.
you know, Lionel, - you're the first ordinary Englishman... - Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
when I'm driven through the streets and see, you know, the Common Man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine.
thank you - What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
balmoral Castle, Scotland "I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves.
I sifted seven..."
isn't that enough darling? No? - I have to keep doing this
this is your fault.
I sifted seven - Oh no
one hundred year old spruces removed to improve the view!
who do you think she is?
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
you know she calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook"?
you're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
you seldom cook.
I sifted seven. - Shut up!!
I sifted...
3, 2,1 and booze - Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
how lovely to see you both.
welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
your Majesty - All right - Sorry we're late
very nice to see you, Mrs Simpson
very nice
Hello， David.
making... some changes to the garden I see.
I am. I am not quite finished yet.
don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
on the contrary, your Royal Highness.
etiquette decrees royalty should be greeted by the official host:
in this case: the King. Not a commoner.
thank you. - what is her hold on him?
I've no idea.
apparently she has certain...skills, which she learnt in an establishment in Shanghai.
david - just be a sec, darling
excuse me.
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
doing what? - Kinging.
Really?
Kinging. is a precarious business these days!
where is the Tsar of Russia?
where is Cousin Wilhelm?
you're being dreary.
is Kinging laying off eighty staff and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there are people marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
stop your worrying. Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody 23"?
and you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
mother's not still in the bed, is she?
that's not funny.
here it is, Wally likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
we intend to marry
excuse me?
she's filing a petition for divorce.
good God.
can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I'm not having her as my mistress.
the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the... head of the Church.
haven't I any rights? - Many privileges...
not the same thing. Your beloved Common Man may marry for love,
why not me?
if you were the Common Man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!
sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
sounds like you haven't.
is that what this is all about? Bashing up?
hence the elocution lessons?
that's the scoop around town.
I'm trying to...to...
yearning for a larger audience are we,
B-b-b-Bertie?
D-don't...
what's that? I'm sorry.
young brother trying to push older brother off throne...
Po.Po.sitively medieval.
wallis - where have you been all this time?
I've been talking to.
never mind.
it's very complicated little king you're - I tried to be
all that work, down the drain.
my own .brother... I couldn't say. a single word to him in reply!
why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie， I'm not a geisha girl.
stop trying to be so bloody clever!
what is it about David that stops you speaking?
what is it about you that bloody well make you want to go on about it the whole bloody time?
vulgar but fluent. You don't stammer when you swear.
bugger off!
is that the best you can do?
Well， bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
a public school prig can do better than that.
shit. Shit, shit, shit!
defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
because I'm angry!
Ah. Know the f-word?
fornication?
Oh， Bertie.
fuck. Fuck, fucking, fuck!
bugger, bugger, bugger!
fuck Fuck ass - Balls Balls Fuckity - Yes! You see! Not a hesitation!
Willy, Shit and Fuck, and tits
dad? What's going on?
sorry. Just finish your homework.
Well， that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
no. No， we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
let's get some air.
No， Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
what's the matter? Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
my brother. is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice
she's asking for a divorce
and he is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
that's not right. Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
unthinkable.
spring training camp and he's definitely got the inside track.
word is that they're having some problems with injuries.
Really? Are they looking into...
...free-agent signings last second, anything like that?
possibly, and they've got a strong farm club too.
they've got some triple-A ballplayers they might bring up.
Peter would certainly be able to tell us more about that.
who do you like?
so far, I like what I'm seeing in New York.
they've got a strong ball club, as usual. That's in the American.
and in the National, I'm still liking Chicago...
...with a little bit of a twist here for Los Angeles.
okay, so we're looking at New York-Chicago World Series...
...possible Los Angeles. Could be a dark horse.
hold him to it at the end of the season.
that's gonna do it for us from the Sports Desk.
back to the studio. Thanks, Dave. Thanks for nothing, Eddie.
thank you, guys. That's not all we're following.
here's Karen at the Health Desk.
the world of medicine has seen its share of miracle cures from the polio vaccine to heart transplants...
...but all past achievements may pale incomparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.
thank you for joining us this morning.
not at all.
so, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.
well, the premise is quite simple.
take something designed by natureand reprogram it...
...to make it work for the body rather than against it.
we're talking about a virus? Yes.
in this case, the measles virus...
...which has been engineered at a genetic level to be helpful rather than harmful.
um, I'm not... I find the best way to describe it is...
...if you can imagine your body as a highway...
...and you picture the virus as a very fastcar being driven by a very bad man...
...imagine the damage that that car could cause.
but then if you replace that man with a cop...
...the picture changes.
and that's essentially what we've done.
now, how many people have you treated so far?
well, we've had 10, 009 clinical trialsin humans so far.
and how many are cancer-free? Ten thousand and nine.
so you have actually cured cancer?
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.
three years later
what you see? What you see?
damn.
let's go, Sam.
come on.
good morning, Matt. It's looking great, I'll tell you.
not only was this the biggest snowstorm in New York City history...
...it had to be one of the prettiest. Imagine waking up on Sunday...
...to 26. 9 inches of snow in New York City.
here you go. Just the way you like it.
disgusting.
excuse me, excuse me.
all right. Come on, relax.
however, it did strand planes, trains and automobiles.
there was a report, a Turkish Airlines flight skidded off the runway at JFK.
no one was injured, but for the most part, Matt...
there you go.
I'm gonna show you, attempting the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.
and I'm gonna plug my ruler in.
in New York, in 30 Rock, we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.
back to you, Matt and Katie.
gosh. All right, it looks great.
it'll be beautiful for the next day, at least.
and then it turns brown. If that.
anyway, Ann, thanks so much.
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.
don't just push them around, eat them. I'm not playing.
good morning. This morning, all up the East Coast...
okay. You gonna eat your vegetables. We will sit down here all night.
the biggest challenge is getting back to work.
what are you whining about? Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?
Hey. All right, here's the deal. Look. Look.
you're gonna eat twice as many vegetables tomorrow night. All right?
deal? Deal?
come on.
don't worry about a thing 'cause every little thing Gonna be all right
I know that feels good.
smiled with the rising sun three little birds
Ah, Sam.
singin' sweet songs of melody...
I'm all right.
I'm all right, it's all right.
what's happening? I tried to reach you on your cell.
I get a recording.
cell service is down. Where are we going?
can't get used to the new regs. Going to Aunt Sara's.
ma! No! Why? Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.
we're at 30 minutes, colonel. Copy.
thirty minutes to what? They're sealing off the island.
seal off the island? This island? But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.
did you bring all the money? Yeah.
how much? Six hundred.
why did you say, "You're going"?
that's not enough. Robert.
you said, "You're going,"not, "we're going."
when you get across, I need you to getto the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.
take Sara's car, go upstate. I'll meet you at the farm.
bring enough food for two weeks.
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?
is it airborne?
but we only go to Aunt Sara's in the summer.
it may be. Oh, my God.
it's Christmas. What about my presents? He's announcing it.
make no mistake, Americans, this virus...
you left my Christmas presents in the closet.
hush now, Mar.
threatens the survival of not only our nation, but of every other nation...
mommy, look, it's a butterfly. Marley, enough!
and so it is with great sadness, but even greater resolve...
...that tonight I have signed an executive order...
...initiating a military quarantine of New York City.
God be with us.
this has been a special...
the window is still open. We find something in a week or two weeks...
...we can reverse the spread.
I can still fix this.
please. You can do the same work outside the city.
this is ground zero. This is my site. We talked about this.
what are you doing?
what am I doing?
I'm not gonna let this happen.
let? This isn't up to you. You can't control...
Ah! Daddy, it's a monster!
how'd you sleep?
look out. Come on, you know better than that.
Uh-uh.
I'll be back.

I can provide shelter.
I can provide security.

Sam, we gotta go!
Sam, go! Go!
Sam, get out! Get out!
you gotta pay attention, okay? You gotta pay attention.
listen, uh...
...I want you to stay here on this one, okay?
because you can still get infected.
and I can't.
so, look, if I'm not back by dark...

I'm still unable to transfer my immunity to infected hosts.

Mm. A behavioral note, um:
an infected male exposed himself to sunlight today.
now, it's possible decreased brain function...

uh...
11 washington Square.
they don't know where I live.
don't... Don't let them track us.
you gotta stay out till dawn.
No!
donkey?
what are you doing?
I would think of all people you would recognize a wall when you see one.
well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.
it is. Around your half, see?
that's your half, this is my half.
Oh, your half? Hm. Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess.
I did half the work. I get half the booty.
now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.
back off! No, you back off.
this is my swamp! Our swamp.
smelly ogre. Fine!
come back, I'm not through with you!
well, I'm through with you.
you know, with you it's always "me, me, me."
well, guess what, now it's my turn.
so you just shut up and pay attention!
you are mean to me! You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do.
you're always pushing me around or pushing me away.
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!
Oh, yeah.
you're right, Donkey. I forgive you...
...for stabbing me in the back!
you're so wrapped up in layers, you're afraid of your own feelings.
go away. See?
doing it again, just like you did to Fiona...
...and all she did was like you, maybe love you.
love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature.
I heard the two of you talking.
she wasn't talking about you, she was talking about somebody else.
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.
obviously you know that.
they're yours.
but I did find bacon, which is about the most fantastic thing in history.
and some antibiotics in the bathroom.
I put by your plate, because your leg is okay...
...but it won't be for very long if you don't start a course soon.
who are you?
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.
don't let it get cold.
it's okay. Go on.
we came from Maryland. We heard your message on the radio.
we were at the pier at noon. We waited all day.
we're going to Vermont.
to the survivors' colony.
what?
in Bethel. It's a safe zone.
there's no survivors' colony, there's no safe zones.
nothing happened the way it was supposed to.
nothing worked the way it was supposed to.
in the mountains. There's a whole colony of people there who didn't get sick.
the virus couldn't survive the cold. There's a colony...
shut up! Shut up!
everybody's dead.
everybody is dead.
I just need... I need a minute. Okay?
just...
I just... I was saving that bacon.
I was saving it.
I'm just... I'm gonna go upstairs. All right? Just...
I'm gonna go.
Ethan, put the knife down.
you there! Ogre. Aye.
by the order of Lord Farquaad...
...I am authorized to place you both under arrest...
...and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.
Oh, really? You and what army?
can I say something to you?
you was really, really something back there. Incredible.
are you talking to me?
Yes, I was talking to you. You was really great back there.
those guards, they thought they was all that. You showed up, and bam!
tripping over themselves like babes in the woods.
that really made me feel good to see that.
that's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free.
now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
Hm?
but, uh...
...I don't have any friends.
and I'm not going out there by myself.
wait a minute. I got a great idea. I'll stick with you!
you a mean, green fighting machine.
together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.
I like Shrek.
that was really scary. If you don't mind me saying...
...if that don't work, your breath will get the job done...
...because you definitely need sometic tacs, because your breath stinks!
man, you almost burned the hair out of my nose. Just like the time...
you're not so good with people anymore, are you?
thank you for my leg.
okay.
where have you been?
I was on a Red cross evacuation shipout of Sao Paulo.
those boats weren't meant to be permanent.
no, they weren't.
when the Navy fell apart, we started docking to take on supplies.
someone picked it up on shore. Five of us were immune.
you said five?
the Darkseekers got them.
you are the Robert Neville, aren't you?
it's too late today.
if we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can make it to Vermont in a straight shot.
so if you had... I'm not leaving.
this is ground zero.
this is my site.
I'm not gonna let this happen.
I can still fix this.
whoa. You scared me. Sorry.
I called down twice.
Oh. Oh, thank you.
it's heavily sedated. Don't worry, it's safe.
I've never seen one so still.
they're always biting.
you think that can cure her?
um... No, this will almost certainly kill it...
...but it's possible by drastically reducing the body temperature...
...I can increase the compound'seffectiveness.
did all of them die?
Yes.
my God.
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.
where can Ethan sleep?
he's heavy.
can you get that?
she's beautiful.
what's her name?
Marley.
her name was Marley. It's a beautiful name.
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.
who? Uh, the singer.
Damian?
uh, his father.
his father.
Nope.
I shot the sheriff
but I didn't shoot the deputy
Oh, that is unacceptable. What?
best album ever made.
you don't recognize that? Mm-mm.
Wow.
he had this idea, it was kind of a virologist's idea.
he believed that you could cure racism and hate.
literally cure it...
...By injecting music and love into people's lives.
one day, he was scheduled to perform at a peace rally.
gunmen came to his house and shot him down.
two days later...
...he walked out on that stage and sang.
somebody asked him why.
he said, " The people...
...who are trying to make this world worse are not taking a day off.
how can I?
light up the darkness.
come with us, Neville.
to the colony.
there's no colony, Anna.
everything just fell apart.
there was no evacuation plan... You're wrong. There is a colony.
I know, okay?
how do you know, Anna?
I just know.
how? I said, how do you know?
how could you know?
God told me.
he has a plan.
God told you? Yes.
the God? Yes.
I know how this sounds. It sounds crazy.
but something told me to turn on the radio.
something told me to come here.
my voice on the radiotold you to come here, Anna.
you were trying to kill yourself last night?
Anna.
I got here just in time to save your life. That's a coincidence?
just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
he must have sent me here for a reason.
Neville, the world is quieter now.
you just have to listen.
if we listen...
...we can hear God's plan.
God's plan? Yeah.
all right. Let me tell you about your God's plan.
there were 6 billion people on Earth when the infection hit.
kv had a 90 percent kill rate.
that's 5. 4 billion...
...people dead.
crashed and bled out, dead.
less than 1 percent immunity.
that left 12 million healthy people like you, me and Ethan.
the other 588 million...
...turned into your Darkseekers.
and then they got hungry.
and they killed and fed on everybody.
everybody!
every single personthat you or I has ever known...
...is dead!
dead!
there is no God. There is no God.
what is that?
was it still dark when you brought us home last night?
you were bleeding. There was light on the horizon.
turn the light off. Turn it off.
they followed us home.
Ethan.
shit.
Anna.
Anna.
Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
Anna?
Anna.
come on. Come on.
are you okay? You all right? Yeah.
are you all right?
you okay? Oh, my God. You're bleeding.
go to the lab. Downstairs, go!
get to the lab! To the lab!
get behind the Plexi.
Oh, my God. Come on.
come on, it's okay. It's okay.
Oh, my God.

I think this is why you're here.
what are you doing?
I'm listening.
Neville, there's room. Come! No.
they're not gonna stop. They're not gonna stop.
stay in till dawn.

I need to know where you were when your convoy was ambushed.
in Baqubah, in the Diyala province. -Okay.
and has contact been made with the kidnappers?
Yeah. The guy says he wants $5 million by 9: 00 tonight.
okay or else...
or else he'll take me to SeaWorld.
what the hell do you think, lady? -We'll do everything we can.
so you'll pay them then? Yeah?
no. That we can't do. -Wait, wait. Why?
to not negotiate with terrorists.
not the policy of the United States government?
lady, come on!
you're sitting in an air conditioned office, this is easy for you to say.
you're not the one stuck in a coffin, buried in the goddamn desert!
I understand your frustration... -Frustration?
lady, I'm going to fucking die in here. Understand that?
Hello? -I'm here.
then say something. Tell me how you can get me out of here.
okay.
what's the number on the phone that you're calling from?
I don't Know. Did it come up on your end? -No. it's listed as unavailable.
tell me this, can you remember a number?
Yeah. No. I have a... I have a pencil.
okay write this down. -Okay, just a sec.
okay. Go ahead.
410... -Yeah.
who's that? -That's Dan Brenner
he's the commander of the hostage working group over in Iraq.
hostage working group?
formed it in 2004 to deal with situations such as yours.
did you write down the number? -Yeah.
good. Now, just hold on, I 'll connect you with him now.
he should be expecting you. -What about the news? I wanna call them.
no, don't call the news.
I repeat, do not contact the news. -Why?
it will only complicate things further. -That's bullshit.
you're just covering your own ass. -No, I'm covering yours.
you don't go looking for something you don't know is missing.
everyone who needs to know about this does.
I need all the help I can get. -We are running out of time, Paul.
that's why you need to contact Dan Brenner right away.
fine.
I'm transferring you now.
Brenner -Dan Brenner?
ls this Paul Conroy? -Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Paul.
Paul, I was informed of what's going on.
I want you to know that we're already working on trying to get you out of there.
thank you, God.
I was told that we have until 9: 00 p. m. ls that right?
that's what he said. -All right.
that doesn't give us a whole lot of time.
and just so I have this right, the kidnappers buried you in the ground?
Yeah. It's an old, wooden coffin.
okay my guess is that since you're able to get a cell signal, -you're no more than a few feet underground. -Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.
what about battery life? How much does the phone have left?
it's just less than half. -Okay you have to conserve that battery.
our best bet of finding you by tracking your cell signal.
ls the ringer set on a sound or vibrate? -Vibrate.
I need you to press and hold down the asterisk key to change it to a ring tone. It will use less power -What about my Zippo? -You have a lighter?
Yeah. -Use it to look around for markings,
don 't worry about that now. Just try to find...
it's just so dark in here without it. -I understand, Paul.
try to find anything in there that might indicate where that coffin was made.
you guys have to hurry. -We're working as fast as we can, Paul.
do you Know if there were any other survivors?
from your convoy? -Yeah .
still unclear at this point.
I just wanted to do right by my family. That's all.
I didn't know it was going to be like this out here.
I don't think any of us did.
that's him. He's calling. -The kidnapper?
Yeah. What should I do? -You know his number?
Yeah. -Give it to me.
okay. What about the call? -Give me the number first.
he's going to hang up. -Take the call.
I... Okay. -That's okay, just take the call.
Hello! Hello.
JABIR: Two hour; four minute.
you have to give me more time. -You talk to embassy?
give the money? -Yeah, yeah. I talked to someone.
the government. They said that they won't pay the money.
no pay? -No.
they said they don't negotiate with terrorists.
terrorists? I am terrorist?
Yeah. Yeah. You're a terrorist, you son of a bitch.
you terrified, so I am terrorist?
what did I ever do to you?
ever do? -Yeah.
Yeah. I'm here because it's a job, to make money.
that's it. -I have job until you come.
now my family have nothing. -That's not my fault!
9/11 was not my fault, but you still here. Saddam was not my fault, but you still here.
I told you, I'm only here to work. To help rebuild.
rebuild what you destroyed.
stop! Stop! Just please, stop! I'm just a guy. I'm just a truck driver. Okay?
I'm nobody that makes decisions about anything.
I just want to go home.
Hello?
you make video. Ransom video. -Yeah, yeah!
I'll make a video. If you let me go, I'll make a video.
no. You make video now.
what? How? -Use video on phone.
near foot. You read note near foot in box.
I don't see it. -Near foot.
read note inside box. -Okay, okay.
if I make the video, you let me go? -Only if we get money.
nobody's going to pay $5 million for me.
we take less. One million, money.
if they pay, you'll let me go?
one million, money.
Shane: Thanks for calling the Conroys. We're not home right now.
please leave a message after the beep. Thanks!
shit.
Dan: Paul? -Here's his number.
hold on. All right, go ahead. -Okay. Hold on.
it's 07-902-24-921.
okay. This is huge, Paul. Unless they're using a cloned line, we should be able to find where this is coming from in minutes.
okay. What about me? Can you track my cell signal?
we 're having a lot of trouble with yours.
seems to be an EDS line, probably through one of the Egyptian carriers.
what does that mean?
that it's just not going to be easy. -He wants me to make a ransom video.
no. Hold off for as long as you can.
if it gets me out of here, I'm making it.
the last thing we want is for this to end up all over Al Jazeera.
We'? - Yes.
this can't turn into an international incident.
that's all you people care about, isn't it? Don't you care about me?
we do. -What about me?
we do, Paul, we do. That's why we're here.
no, no, no, you don't! You don't care about me.
you don't care about any of us.
I've had eight friends killed out here, six of them today.
listen, Paul. You just... -We don't have any guns, any armor.
nothing. -That's because you're not soldiers.
tell that to the people who put me in this box!
Paul, listen. -Tell that to the people who shot my friends!
we're doing the best we can. -No, you're not! You're not!
okay, calm down. -I've been out here nine months.
I know how it works. All you guys care about is your secret plans and your back-room politics.
you know, if I was a diplomat, or a hostage working group leader, or what the fuck your title is,
I'd be out of here by now.
but I'm not, so I'm just supposed to sit in here, shut my mouth and die.
okay, I need you to stay focused, Paul.
fuck you, Dan.
Paul, listen to me. Finding you is our primary concern.
bottom line. And we 're searching for you just as hard as we would be for a four-star general, so don't literally waste your breath suggesting otherwise.
are you injured, Paul? Are you okay?
I don't know. Who are they?
the people who put me in here, who are they?
they're just that, people. No different from you and me.
I'm not a terrorist. -Neither are they.
how do you know?
if you were homeless, starving... Actually I take that back.
if your family was homeless and starving, what would you do for them?
I wouldn't kill somebody. -How can you be sure?
what difference does it make?
they're criminals, desperate ones at that.
they don't care about anything other than getting the money.
so pay them, just pay them.
trust me, if it was an option, I would do that in a heartbeat.
how many others have there been?
since I got here? -Yeah.
dozens. Journalists, contractors, soldiers.
dozens have been taken. it's one of the only functioning businesses out here.
how many have you rescued?
how many? -Not many.
tell me their names. -No.
any of them. -Who?
make me believe that they really do matter to you.
that they really do matter to you.
mark White. -Who was Mark White?
a kid from New Hampshire. Twenty-six years old. Med student.
came over here to help out local doctors.
what happened to him?
insurgents grabbed him. -When?
about three weeks ago.
you remember his name?
I remember all their names.
is he... Did he?
Yeah. Yeah, he's alive.
where is he now? -Home.
probably happy to be back at school.
I want to get out of here.
how?
we already have a solid lead on the number you gave us.
you do? -Yeah. A unit's on its way over there now.
that's good.
that feels good. -Yeah.
what... What should I do in the meantime?
I know it's hard, but try to relax.
the more worked up you are, the more air you're going to use.
okay, I know.
I know. it's hard, 'cause I have anxiety.
I take pills for it.
do you have them with you? -Yeah.
good. Take them.
you need to preserve your oxygen level any way you can.
okay.
ls your Zippo still lit? -No, not anymore.
all right. Good. -I feel nauseous.
you have to calm down. -Okay.
and you need to save that battery.
we 're expecting some intel in about 10 minutes.
call me back then. -Okay.
just hang in there, Paul. - I'm trying, okay.
what? -JABIR: You make video?
no. -You make video!
let me out and I'll make it. -No!
you make video now. -I can't read the paper.
make video now! -I can't.
I don't know what you want me to say. I can't read the paper.

I'm a civilian truck driver for Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
and I have been taken hostage somewhere in Iraq.
I need $1 million by 9: 00 tonight, Baghdad time, or I'll be left to die here in this coffin that I'm buried in.
I'm told that if the money is paid...
I'm told that if the money is paid, I will be let go.

I love you. Call me as soon as you get this. Call me. I love you.
Oh, shit.

my name is Pamela Lutti.
I'm a food service worker at FOB Anaconda, employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
my captors' requests have gone unanswered.
my name is Pamela Lutti.
automated VOICE: The number you requested,
Dan: They're criminals, desperate ones at that.
they don't care about anything other than getting...
automated VOICE: At CRT, we work with our clients to provide...
harris: Sin you're gonna have to stop shouting.
JABIR: Five million, money tonight, 9: 00 p. m. or you stay.
Dan: Finding you is our primary concern. Bottom line.
Shane: Thanks for calling the Conroys. We're not home right now.
please, leave a message after the beep. Thanks!
Dan: Why the hell did you make that video?
it's all a bunch of lies. -What is?
what are you talking about?
all Of it. -All Of What?
you don't give a shit about any of us. We're nothing to you people.
fuck off, Dan. You're babysitting.
just gonna stay on the phone with me until I die.
you have to stay strong. -They shot her and you didn't do anything.
we didn't even know she'd been taken hostage.
she sent three videos. -Yeah. That's what they told her to say.
Why? -I don't know.
what do you know?
that your ransom video already has 47, 000 hits on YouTube.
and all the major networks are playing it, including Al Jazeera.
so now your captors have no choice but to follow through.
I found out the number to this phone.
how? -Who cares?
because I didn't.
just like you and every other person on the planet, there are some things I know, and there are some things I don't.
then how am I ever gonna get out of here?
their signal was cloned, like we figured. But we're close. Really close.
I'm near a mosque.
I heard a call to prayer over the PA.
good. Good. That means that we're in the right area.
you're...
you're nearby?
I spoke with soldiers from the 3rd ID who were escorting your convoy.
they're alive?
not all of them. Both Bradley tanks were hit with IEDs.
the rest got caught in small arms fire
what the hell happened out there, Paul?
Paul?
-Wait.
Paul?
fuck!
come on. Come on.
come on. Come on. Come on.
-Come on.
Hello?
Hello, who's there? ALAN: ls this Paul Conroy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. it's Paul. Who are you?
Paul, my name 's Alan Davenport.
I'm the Personnel Director here at Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
Yeah, yeah. I left you a message.
you did. I also heard from Rebecca Browning over at the State Department.
are you able to speak on the status of your situation?
it's worse. There was an explosion or something, and the sand's coming through.
I probably have about half an hour before it fills right up.
slow down. You should try to stay calm.
the hostage-takers, Dan Brenner from the hostage working group...
okay, Paul. I'm with you. Now, how about the media?
I know your ransom video leaked, but have you spoken directly to anyone about what's going on?
no. No, no, no, no. -Good, good, good, good.
it needs to stay that way.
it's important we keep this situation as contained as possible.
the situation is in a coffin!
I think it's pretty contained! Help me! Help me!
what are you doing right now to help me?
I know you're upset. But from what I've been told, they're extremely close to getting you out of there.
so hopefully it won't be too much longer -Thank God. -Yeah, thank God.
now, I'm going to switch on a recorder right now.
what? -Just a second.
this is Alan Davenport,
personnel Director at Crestin, Roland and Thomas Incorporated.
the date is October 23, 2006.
I'm speaking with Paul Conroy.
mr Conroy are you aware that I'm recording this conversation?
what? -Please answer the question.
shit. -Mn Conroy?
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
and do I have your permission to do so?
why do you need my permission? What's this about?
I need you to answer yes or no, please.
Yes! Yes, all right? -Thank you.
now, Mr Conroy, when were you hired by CRT?
I don't... Nine months ago. Around January. What is all this?
I have your official date of hire as January 4th.
ls that correct? -Who cares?
this is fucking crazy.
january 4th. ls that correct? -Yes!
and during your initial training, before being sent to Iraq, you were made aware of the dangers inherent to the position for which you were hired.
you mean when I came down there to Dallas, and you guys said that all of the trucks would be armored and have bulletproof glass?
you mean when you told us that things were safer than ever over here?
is that when... Is that when I was made aware?
I need you to answer yes or no, please.
Yes.
during that time, did you also receive and sign an employment contract with CRT, which thoroughly explained company policy as it pertained to your specific terms of employment?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I signed a bunch of things. Yeah.
yes or no? -Yes! I signed the contract. Yes.
it's our understanding that you were taken hostage in Iraq two hours ago, is that also correct?
what's the point of all this?
our legal department requires that we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees, confirming that they understand the reasons for their forced separation from the company.
as of this morning, your employment with CRT was officially terminated.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What?
it was brought to our attention that you were engaging in relations with a fellow CRT employee, Pamela Lutti.
no. No, no. Hold on, hold on. -Stipulated in your contract was a fraternization clause, in which it was stated quite clearly -that any relationship... -Stop, stop, stop. Please.
...be it romantic or sexual in nature...
we were just friends. -. . . deemed inappropriate by CRT senior officials is grounds for immediate termination.
hold on. Okay? We were just friends. We were just friends.
our records indicate differently. -Your records are wrong.
we 're also legally required to inform you that because you were technically no longer under the employ of CRT at the time of your abduction, we cannot be held accountable for any injury that may befall upon you after your official date and time of termination.
therefore, in your case, that includes this incident, or any consequences that may result from it.
what about my insurance money? My family's gonna need that money.
given that you were alive up until the time of your termination...
don't do this.
do you understand everything? -Don't do this!
do you understand everything you've been told, Mn Conroy?
Mn Conroy?
you're a piece of shit.
that concludes our interview with Paul Conroy.
I am now turning off the recorder
you put me here.
I'm sorry.
answer the phone. Answer the phone.
come on. Why won't you answer the phone?
Dan: Paul, is that you?
they're dead.
how do you know that? -I just do.
three F-16s leveled parts of the city a few minutes ago.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, that was fun for me.
did they know I was here?
Yeah. -Yeah.
did they care?
these people that took me, if they're dead, they can't tell you where I am.
we can still try to track down your signal.
you tried that already.
we can try again.
it's over, isn't it? -No.
Yeah.
what should I do?
I don't know.
it's weird.
what is?
knowing.
I wish this could have gone differently, Paul.
Yeah.
me, too.

I don't have... My clothes.
I leave you my clothes, which you will grow into.
not these ones.
I don't really have...
I wish that I had more for you, but...

Yeah. Yeah.
just promise me that when you get older that you'll take good care of your mom.
and, I don't know.
you always try to do the right thing.
I love you very much, Shane.

that probably means I didn't. And...
I'm sorry, Linda. I should have listened to you.
you're not dead. Hello? Hello?
JABIR: Where is money?
I don't know. -What don't know?

okay. Oh, God.
I'm sorry, Paul. I'm so sorry.

part l: LOVE AND SUFFERlNG
HOKKAlDO lN DECEMBER
what a voice!
sorry. l was dreaming.
dreaming?
l thought you were dying.
indeed.
l was about to be shot.
l often have the same dream.
l was a war criminal and sentenced to be shot.
you're still alive.
at the last moment they found l was the wrong man. l was saved.
but the shock drove me crazy.
l was in an American hospital.
down south?
okinawa. l' m better now. They released me ten days ago.
what illness?
idiocy.
they call it dementia epilepsia.
l had fits. Then l became an idiot.
an idiot?
"Dostoevsky wanted to portray a genuinely good man.
"ironically he chose an idiot for his hero."
"but a truly good man may seem like an idiot to others."
"this is the tragic story of the ruin of a pure and simple man.."
get up! This man is sick!
no, don't bother... Go ahead.
accept kindness, idiot!
I'm sorry. It's just a habit.
don't worry. l don't mind.
that's a relief.
are you cold?
Yes, very cold.
you're some guy.
"Akama hadn't laughed for many years."
"Dominated by his father, he acted like a caged animal."
"Oddly, he got to like Kameda, who made him laugh."
"Kameda had told him about Taeko Nasu."
"one look at her released Akama's pent-up feelings."
"Enchanted by the woman, " Akama bought her a diamond with his father's money.
"Enraged by it, his father disowned him."
"but owing to the man's death, Akama will go home."
"Kameda is going to Hokkaido, too, to see Ono, his relative. "
another snowstorm in Hokkaido.
look, just follow me.
that's Taeko Nasu.
don't you think she's charming?
very much so. But ...
but what?
it hurts me to look at her face.
Why?
she seems so very unhappy somehow.
why are you crying?
l don't know. Looking at this portrait, l ...
you're really an odd guy.
you make me feel strange, as if l were looking at a newborn lamb.
I'll go. Beware, the world's full of wolves.
Kameda saw her and wept.
a woman of ill repute.
they say she'd been Tohata's property since childhood.
and that Tohata now has to pay 600, 000 yen to get rid of her.
the shadow of Taeko Nasu darkens the house Kameda seeks.
what are you going to do about Kameda?
about Kameda? Well...
he's counting on our help.
I'll try to find him some sort of work.
Kayama has rooms for rent, so Kameda can stay there ls that all?
what do you mean?
it's how you act recently.
how do l act?
you're behaving so secretively.
all those meetings.
tohata may have a lot of influence, but
to force his woman on Kayama...
you know nothing! It's not bad!
I'm glad l don't know.
but any man who'd do a thing like that isn't welcome here!
but...
change the subject!
l want to talk to you about that idiot.
I'm against deceiving such a simple man.
"the army had reported Kameda officially dead."
"so Ono sold Kameda's father's 125-acre farm through Kayama."
"Kayama is now about to marry Taeko in exchange for 600, 000 yen."
"but, Kayama is too weak to assert himself."
"Kayama would rather have Ayako, the younger daughter. "
good morning.
sleep well?
ln the way?
not really. l was just listening to Kayama's views on life.
it's Taeko's birthday tomorrow. You haven't forgotten?
l know, sir.
very well.
Mr. Tohata and l talked her into giving an answer at the party.
you'd better be there.
l understand.
knock first!
something l shouldn't hear?
lunch is ready, Mr. Kameda.
'Ayako - headstrong like her mother.
'at times fastidious, at times mean. "
what if all this were yours?
if, you say?
would you be happy?
Yes, of course.
it may be yours.
I'm afraid l don't understand.
it's a beautiful sight.
what's the matter? Why do you look at me like that?
somehow l just can't believe that you're ill.
l wish l weren't.
I'm funny, right?
it's all right. l don't mind.
people laugh at me. I'm funny without even trying.
what are you like?
l want to know more about you.
what about before the war?
well...
rather not?
it's not that so much.
l vividly remember the day l got a reprieve.
everything before that seems unreal.
tell me about it, then.
how did you feel when you were facing certain death?
the world, its people, everything in it suddenly seemed dear to me
the people in the world?
each and every person I'd known.
and everyone I'd passed.
and not only the people.
there was a dog I'd stoned as a child.
l wondered why l couldn't have been kinder.
to the dog?
kinder to everyone.
l thought, " If l were pardoned and didn't have to die... "
l promised myself I'd be kinder and nicer to everyone around.
it's no use, " l said. " I'm going to be shot! "
thinking of it made me feel terrible.
l sensed that l was going mad.
where were you?
Mr. Kayama wants to take you home now.
where were you?
don't ask. She's stubborn and won't tell.
take care. She never mentions it, but she's proud of her beauty.
it's made her very headstrong.
what about the way she frowns at me?
isn't that typical of her?
indeed.
Taeko Nasu surprised me.
but l must admit she's beautiful.
where did you see her?
ln a photo studio window.
l want to see it.
go on, say I'm too curious!
I'd like to see it, too.
not me.
Really?
l want to see Mr. Kayama. Will you call him? He's in the study.
mother!
sorry not to send the girls. l have a reason.
calling me?
what for? Do you have an idea?
l told them about Taeko Nasu, and...
what? Do you know about her?
but how?
you overheard Mr. Ono and me, and you passed it on?
l just...
why did you do that?
l only told them about the picture at the station.
it can't be helped. I'll go.
do me a big favor.
give Miss Ayako a letter for me.
ls it a bother?
no. But why not do it yourself? You can see her any time.
no. l have a reason for not doing it.
l don't want anyone else to see it, and I'm in a hurry.
mother's in the guest room.
let's go upstairs.
Mr. Kayama asked me to hand this to you.
I'm inclined to be too outspoken.
but don't be offended. l can't stand dishonesty.
we've been like relatives, so I'll speak to you like a mother.
you're going to marry soon?
no, I'm not. Instead I'm...
no? Are you sure about that?
l...
can't you tell me clearly?
when a girl isn't proud to mention her marriage, it makes me wonder.
that's all l wanted to tell you.
l got some sarcastic remarks because of you.
but l
no excuses!
did she answer my letter?
Mr. Kameda, please come.
are you coming with me? I'll wait outside.
read it.
isn't it Mr. Kayama's letter?
Yes. Read it! Read it aloud to me!
you gave it to me.
'tomorrow decides my fate.
'you need say but a single word.
'if you still feel as you once did toward me.
tell me to cancel my marriage and l gladly will do so. "
he's about to marry, enticed by power and 600, 000 yen.
a contemptible marriage.
he wants me to tell him to cancel it.
a trade of my friendship for 600, 000 yen!
if he'd have refused it, l might have become his friend.
give it back to him!
tell him my answer: " There're no bargaining for friendship. "
no bargaining for friendship. That's my answer to him.
her answer?
didn't you give it to her?
of course l did. But she said to read it, so...
read it?
she said to give it back.
she herself told you to read it? Did she?
Yes. l didn't want to, but...
you ass! She'd never ask you to do a thing like that.
but she did. l have her answer.
which is?
'no bargaining for friendship. "
she said, " There's no bargaining for friendship. "
KAYAMA-SO lNN
again!
tattling here too. It's a disgrace!
you, too.
apologize to him.
you've been acting strangely, so l called him.
he told you everything?
don't be silly! How could he have, when he just came?
I'm worried. ls it almost settle this time?
who but he would tell you about that?
l told her.
exactly.
but why? Why?
Tohata's property?
I'm not referring to the woman. l meant you.
l want to know why you're marrying her.
l know.
he hates being poor.
be quiet!
l can't stand it. You're detestable!
what? Say that again!
Yes! Any number of times. You're detestable and she is, too!
if she comes here to live, I'll move out!
as you wish!
don't take it so calmly. There's a lot more.
l wrote to her everything l said to you.
you bitch!
run, Takako! Run!
what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.
announce me.
wait. Who will you say is here?
strange man!
how did you know?
well, l...
never mind that. just announce me.
I'm going to marry her.
it's worth it to make you angry!
miss Nasu is here.
the entrance was cold, so l came inside.
you look pale. Anything wrong?
introduce me.
my sister. Miss Nasu.
my mother. Miss Nasu.
how do you do. I'm glad you came.
are you really?
I'm a fool, aren't l?
it's a magnificent home.
l thought l might not be welcome here.
that's ...
mother, a word.
make some tea.
may l sit down, too?
please do.
don't be such a nuisance! We have a guest now.
my father. Miss Nasu.
Jumpei Kayama, a pitiful wronged former soldier.
I'm fifty years old, but l haven't done a thing.
let me introduce Mr. Kameda, Mr. Ono's relative.
he's interesting.
sorry l asked you to announce me.
well, l...
how did you know me?
before that, why did you seem so surprised?
l felt as though I'd seen your eyes somewhere before.
then, it's true!
my rival!
why are you here?
who are you?
huh! Him?
who are you?
I'm Denkichi Akama, and l have plenty of money!
I'll buy you out!
get out of here!
are you really going to marry this man?
l remember now. You once gave me a diamond, didn't you?
but why are you asking me that?
ln what way do our marriage plans concern you?
look, I'll pay you 600, 000 yen, so give her up!
what are you talking about? Are you drunk?
700, 000 yen! 800, 000!
ass! Leave, or I'll call the police!
a million yen! I'll bring it tonight!
a million by tonight, All right?
my price has suddenly gone up by 400, 000 yen?
scum!
father!
he made fools of you, nevertheless you'd
shut up!
No! Not after we've been shamed like this!
kick her out, or l will!
that's enough!
don't meddle! Out of my way!
fool brother!
it's all right. l don't mind. Not at all.
he's a lamb. You've no shame.
it's nothing. Nothing at all.
nothing.
you're not like that.
you're not, yet...
I'm exactly what she said l was.
will you forgive me?
goodbye, Mr. Kayama. Tonight, then.
you too, Mr. Kameda. Don't forget.
the hostess leaving her guests? What's the matter?
you look pale.
do you have a fever?
that's why I'm waring this.
why not rest a little?
I'd like to speak with you.
you're very kind, but l want to drink more.
what's the matter? Enjoy yourselves.
Mr. Kameda has arrived.
that man! He saw her at my place.
not together? l asked you to see to it.
show him in.
why see him?
he's an idiot?
l don't think so.
he might even be somewhat more clever than you...
at least in knowing about how people fell.
l knew it!
the nerve of you!
how cold l...!
do you know what it's worth?
l have one question: Didn't you give it to me?
then let me do as l wish.
I'd intended to break them, anyway.
l won't bother with introductions. No one here is worth it.
what a remark!
fortunately, though, l already know him.
what's wrong? Why stare at her like that?
really. ls there anything the matter?
it just occurred to me.
l thought I'd seen eyes like yours. l just remembered where.
eyes like mine?
why is it l didn't remember?
what was the person like?
a man who was sentenced to die, like me.
there were three judas-trees, and three men were shot at the same time.
l was in the rear of two rows of men.
l would have been shot soon.
l had no idea that l would get a reprieve.
l didn't think I'd live.
and the man? The one with eyes like mine?
ln the first group shot.
he couldn't have been over twenty. He looked like a boy.
tied to that tree, he seemed to be in a trance.
he suddenly began trembling.
he looked at us as if to complain.
the eyes of a man who has undergone suffering, alone, for a long time.
his eyes seem to say, " Why must l endure this kind of pain? "
he suffered a lot.
his eyes seemed ready to burst and spurt blood.
for a moment l forgot l was about to be shot, too.
l turned my eyes away.
at times your eyes are almost exactly like that boy's.
what next? What happened to the soldier?
l jerked my head to look at him.
and there he was, limp, like a rag.
that's too much! It's too gruesome. This is a birthday party.
quiet, please!
my birthday means nothing to you, does it?
Mr. Kameda.
frankly...
they say I'm to marry Mr. Kayama.
I'm supposed to give him my answer tonight.
should l accept or not?
bad taste!
I'll do as you say.
how absurd!
please, Mr. Kameda, tell me.
why ask him? What's he to you?
don't you know?
he trusted me the first time he laid eyes on me.
what else can l do but trust him?
so tell me. Please advise me what to do.
you shouldn't marry him.
then l won't.
did you hear that, Mr. Kayama? That's my answer to you.
that's ridiculous!
what about the promise you made a few days ago?
Tohata, what's the meaning of this?
l see. Does this make you satisfied?
what?
l see. You hate to part with your treasure, is that it?
I'm the dupe.
you are? You mean l am!
you're responsible.
pals shouldn't fight.
Mr. Ono and Mr. Kayama, don't try to blame Mr. Tohata.
I'll never go back to him.
what a face!
you needn't pay one yen for your freedom.
put away your 600, 000 yen.
I'll return this house and everything else you gave to me.
I'm leaving, with only what I'm wearing.
Taeko! l was wrong. I'm such a fool!
forget it.
I'm not a fourteen-year-old girl now.
listen to me. l promise you.
l don't care what the world thinks.
I'll marry you!
don't be so conceited as to think that I'd ...
who are you?
what is this?
you kept your promise? Thank you.
he'll pay a million yen for me.
400, 000 more than you will.
I'm through with this.
as of tomorrow I'm broke.
no man would accept somebody's cast off.
who doesn't have any money.
am l right?
Kameda 's the man to ask.
if it were me, I'd take care of you.
what did you just say?
l said, if it were me, I'd look after you.
a woman like me? The way l am?
of course.
but what do you mean, " A woman like me " ?
l don't understand.
why laugh?
did l put it in a funny way?
look, all l wanted to say was this:
miss Nasu is very chaste.
that's enough, idiot!
are you making fun of me?
I'm really a sick man. My brain is rotten.
so l may have said something odd.
but l tried to express what l honestly think of you.
l don't care if the world laughs at me.
l think you're chaste.
you said you'd leave, taking nothing with you.
that's fine with me.
and I'll let no one speak ill of you.
so why feel ashamed? Why sell yourself to a man like him for a dirty 1, 000, 000 yen?
don't interfere!
let me speak.
you've suffered too much alone.
so you feel uncomfortable if you don't suffer.
you really are ill.
you need a kind nurse.
I'll be a nurse and take care of you.
how can you support a woman who's used to high living?
you're a pauper!
I'll find work, somehow.
what work? Shoveling snow?
they'd pay him only 300 yen for it.
not even enough to buy her cosmetics.
that's enough. Stop making fun of him.
thank you.
no one has ever said anything like that to me.
miss Taeko...
l think...
I'll manage.
when l first saw your picture, you seemed to be calling me.
as a matter of fact, I'd been waiting for a man like you.
l waited even while leading such a life.
I'd sit and think. l formed a mental image of a man like you.
l hoped a nice man, honest and kind, would finally appear.
'Taeko, it's not your fault. "
l deeply respect you. "
l hoped he'd phrase it something like that.
then a man actually would come.
he'd use me, deprave me, and go away.
you'll never know how much l hated it.
I'd rather drop dead in the streets than continue this life.
but...
I'm afraid your idea is out of the question.
everyone, l have an important announcement.
no, It's actually a confession.
as a man, I'm despicable, utterly, completely.
l hid from everyone the fact that Mr. Kameda has a fortune.
as his relative, l believed it in his best interest.
anyway, l want to announce that he's the owner of a 125-acre farm.
step inside!
you really mean what you said about her?
it's a joke.
what? Then, you mean...?
it's clear, isn't it? I'll go with him.
Taeko, why? Surely not with him?
step aside!
listen.
how can l ruin the life of a naive man like you?
you forgot something important: 1, 000, 000 yen.
l raised it myself.
be quiet. Keep away. I'll give it to Mr. Kayama.
take it out with your bare hands, and it's all yours!
it's burning!
it'll be lost completely! A million yen!
l wrapped it myself!
be quiet! Keep away!
don't just stand there. Hurry, or it'll burn completely!
what's the matter? Don't you want it?
you worm! See now?
that's how we do things.
don't pretend. Be yourself.
or you'll regret it.
pull it out, for God's sake! What's a little pride?
Hurry!
the money's burning! Burning!
it's safe! It's all right!
only four or five thousand burned.
step aside!
everybody!
this is all for Mr. Kayama!
he watched it. He would have let it burn. So it's for him!
understand?
with that, farewell, everyone.
goodbye, Mr. Kameda.
come, men! Drink!
don't go, Kameda!
you can't save such a woman.
february
Ayako, don't play with your bread!
why are you all so quiet?
something's wrong lately.
the weather... no sun for weeks. It makes everybody depressed.
it's not that. l know! It's that man!
l really misjudged him.
why pay him so he can squander the money on her?
but...
the way you did it displeases me. Isn't there a better way?
Karube, his representative!
and you, acting so upset and secretive, as if you felt guilty!
that man, too! Couldn't he send a thank-you note?
ls he really an idiot?
what's so funny?
but...
'but " again! Can't you say anything else?
but, Ayako...
she's up to something again? Such young ladies!
tell me. What is it?
he sent her an odd letter.
an odd letter? When?
a week ago. By Kayama's brother.
Kaoru, the junior high school boy? Kameda used him?
Kameda's in Tokyo. How could he do it?
he put his letter in Kaoru's.
so? What did the letter say?
frankly, l have no idea why I'm writing to you like this.
'but l simply cannot suppress the hope that " perhaps you sometimes think about me.
'for reasons l find it difficult to explain, " you are very important to me.
"I've nothing else to say or write about myself."
'l wish you happiness. "
what's funny?
this letter is funny. Do you know why?
it's because Kameda doesn't lie. He's totally honest.
now you can't laugh, can you?
l see. You lost, didn't you?
but why did he send it?
have you heard anything about the idiot?
evidently he's still chasing Taeko, just like Akama is.
it's as though she's swinging like a pendulum between them.
she once said she'd marry Akama, but she ran away with Kameda.
something's bound to happen.
forget something?
no, but l...
l felt someone looking.
what is it, a murder or something?
Akama's not above murder.
stop! It's depressing as it is!
come in.
come as you are.
watch your step.
what's wrong? Why stare at me like that?
sit down.
Akama, l want you to tell me the truth.
were you at the station?
l won't say.
a pair of eyes in the crowd looked exactly like yours.
whose eyes?
did l imagine it then? l sometimes have hallucinations.
the room is dark, huh?
an old house.
l spotted your house from a distance of at least 100 yards.
Oh? How?
intuition. l have a feeling your house would be like this.
Yes, it is dark.
you have a forbiddingly dark aura about yourself, too.
staying here after you marry?
of course. It's my home.
when's the wedding?
you know l can't decide a thing like that alone.
please, l wish you'd tell me the truth.
l don't want to meddle or anything.
she's here in this house now, isn't she?
have you decided?
if we have?
you came to find out?
not really.
but l think it's best if the two of you don't marry.
l told you, didn't l?
marriage would spell the ruination of you and of her too.
there's nothing l can do to stop you.
you understand, don't you?
l can only feel sorry for her.
everything she does worries me.
l can't just watch.
we talked about this before, didn't we?
l ask only for her happiness, nothing more.
why scowl at me.
I'll leave. Goodbye.
stay. It's been quite a while.
the minutes you leave, l know I'll hate you again.
you made me boil for a month after we parted in Tokyo.
l could've murdered you!
it's true.
but facing you, l soon forget my anger.
help!
Eddie! - What?
Eddie! Wake up!
don't move. Okay, listen to me. - Where are we?
whatever you do, don't lean forward. - What's this? What's...
what's going on? - No!
hello. I want to play a game.
the devices on your heads are symbolic of the shackles that you place upon others.
you recklessly loan people money, knowing their financial limitations, counting on repossessing more than they could ever pay back.
you are predators, but today, you become the prey.
and it is your own pound of flesh that I demand.
this is your fault!
the scale before you is your only path to freedom.
however, only one of you may pass, and the toll is the ultimate sacrifice, the sacrifice of flesh.
before you are the instruments to exact this flesh.
move with haste, though, for when the 60-second timer hits zero, the one who has given the most flesh will release their bindings, while the gears on your opponent's head will engage, piercing their skull.
who will offer the most flesh in order to save their life?
the choice is yours.
No!
I'm not dying for you, bitch!
No!
I ask you, Special Agent Strahm, have you learned enough to trust me?
for if you do not, this room will forever be your tomb.
you will never be heard from again, your body will never be found, and my legacy will become yours.
make your choice.
there was a pre-existing condition, which you did not inform your insurance company of.
thank you.
Hey, babe. Good. Listen, I am so, so sorry, but I can't make dinner.
I've got to work late again. Well, I've got to meet with legal, and that's going to jam me up for certainly, the rest of the afternoon.
I know it's your birthday. I'm going to make it up to you, I promise.
love you.
what were we talking about? - We're talking about your deposition.
don't worry about me, Debbie.
some small-time lawyer trying to squeeze us is not gonna get me to say anything I don't want to say.
I have no doubt about that, but as lead counsel for this company, if you screw up, it comes down on my ass.
so what do you say we prep your deposition?
Christ.
do you remember dealing with a Mr. Harold Abbott?
William, I have a Casey Patterson on line 1.
take another message, Addy. I'll get back to her this week.
some time. Keep going.
when opposing counsel asks you about Mr. Abbott, how will you respond?
I am going to respond by saying, as Senior Vice President of Membership and Claims, it is my job to review every terminated policy.
as a matter of fact, Mr. Abbott was sitting right where you are now when we discussed his appeal.
I just... I don't get it.
I've been with this insurance company for over 10 years.
I know, Harold. But, unfortunately, when we reviewed your claim, we discovered that you failed to mention a previous condition.
what condition? There was no condition.
it says here you had oral surgery to remove a cyst from your jaw.
this is absurd! I have heart disease.
it has nothing to do with some oral surgery I had 30 years ago.
any type of oral surgery is going to leave scar tissue.
scar tissue can lead to gum disease.
and, as you well know, gum disease can cause heart disease.
you know what? You're... You're a criminal.
you are a goddamn criminal.
I paid my monthly premium for 10 years without so much as a cold.
and now that I'm actually sick, you're going to deny my coverage?
I have a family! - Those are the rules, Harold.
I'm sorry, but your own actions have caused this.
you've just given me a death sentence. I mean, who's going to cover me now?
you just killed me.
I have family, too, so I can empathize with his argument.
but, basically, the guy lied on his application.
Hey. Watch it, Will. - What?
do you think he did that on purpose?
all right.
it wasn't my job to assess what his intentions were.
it was my job to check the accuracy of his claim.
look, everyody thinks we're the bad guys.
nobody mentions the millions of people we help every year without incident or the millions of dollars we donate to charity every year or all the free clinics we support.
short answers, Will. Short answers. - Today in probate court, the assets for one of history's most notorious serial killers, John Kramer,
they were mainly in real estate holdings. But in my time researching...
one more question. Who found the error on his application?
the dog pit. They work as a team.
if there's a discrepancy to be found in an application, the six of them will find it.
sir, they're waiting for you in the conference room.
very good.
how's it going today, people? - Great, Mr. E.
found two application errors for a chronically ill client.
this guy practically lives at his doctor's office.
I mean, this could probably save us nearly 200K over his lifetime.
terminator strikes again.
I'll be back in a few hours.
looking good, Hank.
who will offer the most flesh in order to save their life?
the choice is yours.
I'm not dying for you, bitch!
Yeah.
I'm on my way.
what's going on?
feds who took over the crime scene are requesting you ASAP.
Erickson.
I didn't know you ever made it out from behind the desk.
I make exceptions when fingerprints are found at a Jigsaw murder scene.
have a look.
we also got a right index off the scale.
been ID'd yet? - Yeah. They're Agent Strahm's.
when I learned that he and Perez were being targeted by Jigsaw,
I should have been more aware. But I didn't see this coming.
not from Peter Strahm.
it was a shock to all of us. - Yeah.
but we have something he doesn't know about.
you want to follow me?
Lindsey.
detective Hoffman. - Perez.
it was my call, Detective.
I knew that Jigsaw wasn't working alone, but until I knew for certain who was helping him,
I couldn't guarantee her well-being.
so you let me think she was dead? - Well, I didn't know who I could trust.
what else have you been keeping from me?
we know that Agent Strahm knew the five people in the real estate scam, the victims from the traps that Erickson found.
how'd he know them? - Strahm and I investigated them after the house fire.
it was arson and all five people were accountable.
but after our lone witness went missing, no charges were ever filed.
Strahm couldn't let them get away, so he put them in a trap in which slaughtering each other was the only way out.
so, what are you telling me, he's a vigilante?
call him whatever you like, but he has to be found.
we'd like to work together on this.
you led me to believe that she was dead, and you want to work with me?
look, we're offering full disclosure, Detective.
from now on, everything we know, you know. Is that fair?
detective Hoffman, how about a quick word?
Pamela Jenkins, the resident Jigsaw sensationalist.
just reportng the facts, Detective.
is that what you're doing? "John Kramer, conundrum of carnage."
if you'd like to make a statement on the record,
I'd be more than happy to take it.
you know, twisting the facts to make a better story is irresponsible.
excuse me. Nice catching up.
I know more about John Kramer than you might think.
somehow I doubt that.
Kramer left his wife a box in his will. Did you know that?
maybe I did, maybe I didn t. How do you know it?
probate court. It's public record for those who know where to look.
all right. What do you really want?
Jill Tuck. Help me get to her and I'll dial down on the sensationalism.
Really? I'll see what I can do.
do you remember how you were transported there?
I don't know how I got there.
just opened my eyes and... He did this to me.
who did this?
jigsaw.
you didn't cut your own arm off? - I did. I did.
but he made me do it.
and why is that?
because what Eddie and I were doing was wrong.
we were... We were ruining people's lives.
and he wanted us to learn.
and did you?
look at me.
look at my goddamn arm!
what the fuck am I supposed to learn from this, huh?
look at my arm! What... What am I supposed to learn from this?
just breathe. - Look at me!
Hello, Gideon.
it's a good name, hon. - Wow. Wow.
could have been Scarlet. But, no, has to be a boy.
let me see if I can get all three of us in there.
snuggle around here. Lean inside. There we go.
there we are. - Hey, Gideon.
we love you, son. We're waiting for you. - We love you.
Gideon, Gideon, Gideon.
if you're watching this, Jill, I'm long gone from this world.
I'm leaving you a box today, and its contents are of grave importance.
hello. I'm not in right now, but please leave a message.
miss Tuck, this is Pamela Jenkins calling, yet again.
I was hoping you can clear some things up for me about your husband.
let me buy you lunch or a cup of coffee.
I've found something interesting about John Kramer's death.
are you there, Detective?
by hearing this tape, you will likely assume this is over.
you feel you now have control, don't you?
you think you will walk away untested.
look here.
these are the Jigsaw pieces cut from previous victims. This is the piece taken from the latest victim.
it looks like all the rest. - Yeah, that's what we said, too.
the skin abrasions, they're indicative of a knife with a partially serrated edge.
so? - So, all of the other cuts were made with a near-perfect blade of surgical quality.
obviously, Strahm used a different knife than John Kramer.
right. But it got us curious, so we pulled the files to compare.
that same knife was used on only one other victim.
and that victim was Seth Baxter, the man who killed your sister.
you're telling me that you can tell a different knife was used from a photo?
no, but I can. I was the one who examined that body.
I've examined every victim of the Jigsaw Killer.
good work.
the tape from the latest victim was missing, so we're looking into the Seth Baxter tape.
Why's that? - Well, if a different person cut the piece, then maybe a different person made the tape, too.
Strahm? - Yeah, maybe.
Strahm's voice on that tape would be our smoking gun.
if we had that, we'd go public with his involvement.
Hey, Jill.
but that's not what the prescription... - I'm sick!
look at me! Look at me! - Hey. It's okay. Sorry.
I didn't expect to see you here so soon.
change of plans.
the game begins tonight. - Why?
because somebody knows about the box that shouldn't.
who? - That's not your concern.
all you need to know is that from now on, I control all aspects of the game.
that's not what John wanted.
give me the envelopes. And that's not a request.
here.
from now on, I work alone.
I know. I'm only carrying out John's final request.
well, John's dead. And his work is almost done.
who's this? - Unfinished business.
when I'm done, we no longer speak.
...forty-five minutes. - Yes, I understand that.
please! Please. - But we have to wait for the doctor.
let my hand go.
methadone is a masking agent. It doesn't heal, it simply numbs the senses.
I've found a better way.
these people, they will continue to hurt you and let you down.
they're addicts, John. Recovery is a process.
maybe addiction's just part of human nature.
but what about these people, Jill, who come here every day and use you?
they bide their time. They're avoiding prison sentences.
they're getting hooked on masking agents. Do you call that recovery?
it's not that simple.
addiction is not simple, Jill! Wake up!
these people have no respect for the lives that they're destroying.
once you see death up close, then you know what the value of life is.
and that's my way.
and I brought proof that it works.
Amanda? - Hello, Jill.
Jill, you once told me that she was a lost soul.
but here she stands.
she's clean and whole.
and she has a new appreciation for her life.
it works. It's real. He helped me.
...as this is not just the macabre conjectures of a psychic, but a foregone conclusion just waiting to rear its ugly head.
even though police would have you believe John Kramer, aka Jigsaw, is dead, just this past week a new so-called game was discovered with grisly results.
victims have included anyone associated with the life of John Kramer, however remote.
the Jigsaw Killer may be dead, but the murders continue.
shit!
Hank, you still here?
don't fucking move.
shit! Oh, fuck! Okay.
okay, I'm gonna take care of you. Just... Where'd you get hit? You wearing a vest?
Hello, William.
Oh, Jesus.
you've probably been wondering when we would see each other again.
today is that day. - No!
for years, your probability formula has decided the fate of others.
the healthy have benefited while the potentially sick have been unjustly rejected.
however, this formula does not take into account the human will to live.
when faced with death, who should live versus who will live are two entirely separate things.
today, your policy will be put to the test.
there are four straps around your limbs, and you have four tests you must complete, for if you don't, the straps on your arms and legs will detonate.
look closely.
Oh, shit!
you have 60 minutes to complete your tests and avoid this fate, starting now.
you are not alone in this game.
just as you have taken loved ones away from their families, if you don't reach the end before the timer hits zero, you will never see your family again.
mom? Mom! Mom. Mom, wake up! Mom.
mom.
where are we? - I don't know.
what is this? - I don't know! Look.
Oh, my God.
here is your first test.
your health and hereditary background put you in the highest category of success.
however, the same cannot be said for your adversary.
while only 52 years of age, this man has continued to smoke even though he has a history of high blood pressure and heart disease.
this demonstrates very little appreciation for the blessings of his own life.
your game will focus on the simple element of air.
once this game begins, every time you take a breath, the clamps around your chest will close in and crush your body.
the only escape is in the other's failure.
so I ask you, when faced with death, who will survive?
live or die, William. Make your choice.
fuck you! - Who the hell is that?
hold your breath!
what the fuck? Oh, Jesus!
come on! Come on!
shit!
please help us!
help us! Someone, please! Please! Help us!
somebody, please! Please! Please, somebody help!
anybody?
"live. Die." What the fuck?
it's connected to that.
H-F. What does that stand for? - Hydrofluoric acid.
this stuff will eat through human flesh within seconds.
what should we do? - Pull the lever. You want to live, don't you?
what about the timer? That has to mean something.
I don't know. I don't even know why we're here.
we're here because of your father.
miss Jenkins.
please, this will only take a second. We can help each other.
what makes you think you can just come to my door like this?
because I found something you'll want to see.
go on.
Where'd you get this? - It was at the location where John died.
does it mean anything to you? - No.
goodbye, Miss Jenkins.
if you think of anything.
I want to thank you for sponsoring this party, William.
and I know how much the clinic appreciates it.
John Kramer. - William Easton.
Kramer? You're Jill's husband, right? - I am.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
sounds like we're in a similar business, John.
Oh, yeah? How's that?
well, you try to predict people's behavior. So do I.
when people come to us for coverage, we have to analyze each person for the probability of success.
how do you do that? - Well, it's a formula.
it's pretty complicated actually, but, in essence, it breaks down to monthly payments multiplied by lifespan minus the probability of illness.
and if the sum is positive, we consider coverage.
who devised that formula? - Me.
so, in a sense, you choose who lives or dies.
no. I... No, I'd say I decide which people have the potential to live long, healthy lives.
but you're not taking into consideration the most important human element of all.
which is what? - The will to live.
until a person is faced with death, it's impossible to tell whether they have what it takes to survive.
fuck that.
shit.
Hello, William.
standing on the platforms behind me are two of your colleagues.
one, your file clerk, a young, healthy male with no living relatives.
the other, a middle-aged woman with a family history of diabetes.
according to your policy, your secretary is older and weaker and therefore less worthy to survive.
but you know the loss that she will be to her family, while young Allen will disappear without a blip on the world's radar.
only one can exit this room, and the choice of whom falls upon you.
you must let go of one to save the life of the other.
as you can see, the choice is not so clear when you are face to face with the people whose blood will stain your hands.
let the game begin.
wait! No! No, wait! I won't do this! I won't do this!
William!
it's a business! My decisions aren't made this way!
no, I'm not gonna do it! I m not gonna do it!
I'm not gonna do it!
stop! - Please! Help me!
I'm sorry. - No! No!
I'm sorry.
thank you. Thank you!
you try to find a way out of here, Addy. I have to keep going. Be careful.
what if we put acid on the metal bars? It'll eat through the metal, won't it?
Yeah, but how are we going to get it on the bars? With our hands?
what are you looking at?
I wonder... The mirror.
what? - Who's behind the glass?
what do you want?
why are you doing this?
help me, please! Please, help me!
Hello, Pamela. You've sensationalized my life, twisting the truth and exploiting my message for your own benefit.
Hoffman. - It's Erickson.
we found the Seth Baxter tape. - Yeah?
but there was something else that we wanted to discuss with you.
what's that? - Better to talk about it in person.
it's time-sensitive.
I'll be right there.
excuse me.
just down there. - Thank you.
the device Timothy is strapped to is my personal favorite. I call it The Rack.
last-minute tweaks? Told you he'd fuck with it.
if you switch the gear ratio, you have to change the gear grease to match the increased friction.
maybe you should stick to the heavy lifting.
you need five-weight.
it's in the gun.
check with me next time.
how many next times are there gonna be?
however many there needs to be.
that's a human being.
do you like how brutality feels, Mark?
let's be honest. You want him to suffer just as much as I do.
so when's your test, Detective? - I don't need one.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
because I didn't take my life for granted.
you're still dragging your knuckles on the ground.
what do you know about life?
get used to me, cause I'm not going anywhere.
you sure about that?
time is short.
you okay?
now it's time to go get Dr. Denlon from the hospital.
okay. I'll take you back.
go. Be quick.
why'd you come? - John, please stop.
don't do this. - I promise you, when all this is done,
I will provide a way out for you.
I wish that time was now.
then I have something for you.
what's this for?
when the time's right, you'll know what to do with it.
shit!
I came to talk to you, Will, because
I've found a treatment for my cancer that I think holds a lot of promise.
but my requests for coverage - have all been turned down. - Yeah.
so I was hoping that if I came and explained it to you, that you might be able to get that overturned for me.
well, the buck stops here, John. Fire away. - Okay.
this is a doctor in Norway.
he's got a 30 to 40% Success rate with gene therapy.
he injects what he calls suicide genes into cancerous tumor cells.
then an inactive form of a toxic drug is administered...
Yes. I'm familiar with the therapy you're talking about.
right. And a new trial's starting.
he's looking for new patients, and he seems to think that I'm the perfect candidate.
John, if your primary physician, Dr. Gordon, thought you were a suitable candidate, - he would have pursued it. - No.
Dr. Gordon is a specialist. You know, he's making money on his specialty.
he's not a thinker.
I mean, the man has his hand on the doorknob half the time that I'm there.
I'm gonna be straight with you. At your age and with the development of your cancer, it's simply not feasible for Umbrella Health...
wait, wait, wait, wait. What's not feasible?
by whose mathematical equation is this not feasible?
it's policy, John. It's policy.
and if you go outside the system and seek out this treatment, which has been deemed ineffective, you will be in breach of policy and you will be dropped from coverage completely.
I'm sorry.
did you know that in the Far East, people pay their doctors when they're healthy?
when they're sick, they don't have to pay them.
so, basically, they end up paying for what they want, not what they don't want.
we got it all ass-backwards here.
these politicians, they say the same thing over and over and over again.
healthcare decisions should be made by doctors and their patients, "not by the government."
well, now I know they're not made by doctors and their patients or by the government.
they're made by the fucking insurance companies.
piranha.
John, please. If you do this, you'll be on your own, and the subsequent cost to you will be staggering.
don't talk to me about money. I have money.
this is about principle.
you see, Will, this is my life we're talking about.
you remember? - What about Jill's life?
how's she going to be taken care of when you're gone?
let me worry about Jill.
the type of cancer you have is malignant and inoperable.
that rolled off your tongue real smooth.
even if the treatment works, the cancer will return eventually.
it's an unwinnable battle. - That was even smoother.
as a matter of fact, that was downright slick.
you think it's the living who will have ultimate judgment over you, because the dead will have no claim over your soul, but you may be mistaken.
Oh, shit!
Hello, William. You have seen the flaws in your policy.
but what you have not seen is the extent some people will go to when faced with death.
the lawyer from your firm has...
Debbie! - ...90 seconds to cross this room or the device attached to her chest will discharge and pierce her brain.
it's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.
she will find that the journey across this room is filled with danger.
in order for her to make it, you will need to be there for her, and it is you who ultimately holds the key to her survival.
when faced with death, will she have the skills to live?
let the game begin.
okay. Okay, listen!
Jesus Christ! What the fuck is this? - Debbie! Debbie! Listen to me!
Debbie! Okay, Debbie, listen to me! Debbie! - What is this?
get me the fuck out of here! - Get through the maze as fast as you can. Listen to me!
get me out of here! - Debbie!
okay. You've got to get through this maze as fast as you can! Go! Move now! Go now!
come on! You can make it! You can make it! You got to keep moving! Go!
will, this is insane! I can't! - Go! You can make it!
come on! You can make it! You've got to keep moving!
wait a minute! I think I can help you up here!
maybe this will stop it!
Yes! Yes!
do it again! It worked! It worked!
do it again! It worked, it worked, it worked! - Okay! Ready?
Yes! - Go!
keep moving! Don't stop! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!
don't stop!
you gotta keep going! Keep going! Go! Go!
keep moving! Go! Go! Go!
fuck, I can't! It's a fucking trap! There's no way out!
it's a fucking trap! I can't!
No! No, there's a ladder at the end! So just go under! I'll help you!
ready?
go!
God! Come on, Debbie, go! Climb! Climb!
come on! Come on, you're almost there! You're almost there!
go! Go! Go!
okay, look for a key. There's got to be a key! Look for a key!
what?
what are you waiting for?
it's in you. - What?
it's fucking inside you! - Oh, fuck!
okay. Okay, I can do this. Wait!
what the fuck are you doing? - I need that fucking key!
I can get it! I can get it! I can get it!
God! No! God! No!
Hello, Pamela.
well, today you will experience the meaning of sacrifice.
and you will see the consequence for those who unjustly hurt others.
fuck!
someone's there. They're watching us.
Why? Why would someone do this?
to see how we respond.
they want to know what decision we'll make.
let's pull it. - No! We don't know what it does yet.
it's too risky.
fuck!
Hey.
thanks for coming in. - What'd you find?
an abnormality in Strahm's fingerprint. - What?
take a look.
so the human fingerprint leaves an oily residue, and depending on how long it's been exposed to the elements, - it's highly susceptible to contamination. - So what's the problem?
well, we found trace amounts of halomethane R-12.
she means Freon.
production of R-12 ceased in 1994.
so the question is, was the contaminant we found at the site already or did Strahm bring it in with him?
Yeah. We're looking into the building's function before it was abandoned.
excuse me.
did anything come from the Seth Baxter tape?
Yeah, actually, we might be on to something.
the tape was in pretty rough shape when we found it, but we were able to authenticate it.
the voice was intentionally distorted, but it didn't match John Kramer's.
it's currently being analyzed. - For what?
well, we're trying to descramble the tape to find the original voice.
he's on with the tech right now.
are you timing something? Your watch.
I was before I got your call, yeah.
we got it. This is our smoking gun.
the lab's off-site. Come on.
you're coming, right? - Of course.
you shut up! All you do is try to take over every situation.
you don't know what the fuck you're talking about!
shut the fuck up!
fuck off! - Would you two just shut up already!
we can figure this out.
Hey! Who's in there? - Mr. Easton? Is that you?
Yeah. Shelby? Who's in there with you? - Mr. Easton!
we're all in here, sir. All six of us. What the hell is going on?
everybody! We need your help.
what can you see?
we can't see anything. It's pitch dark.
what's that sound? - I don't know, something we're chained to.
it's spinning. Oh, God. - Get us out of here!
you have to help us! - Please!
come on, get us out of here, Mr. E!
Mr. Easton!
Mr. Easton! You got to get us out of here!
Oh, my God!
pull it together, Mr. Easton. Come on!
you can do it! - You can do it!
Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton!
please! Please get us out of here! Please!
Mr. Easton, what is this?
it's a game.
game? - Mr. Easton?
Hello, William. Before you are six of your most valuable associates, the ones who find errors in policies.
their findings result in over two-thirds of all applications denied or prematurely terminated.
now you must apply your analysis to them. And will you be able to find their errors?
six ride the carousel.
but only two can get off.
the decision of which two survive falls upon you.
but remember, the mounted gun will continue to fire until all six rounds are spent.
and if no decision is made on your part, all six will perish.
what? What?
to offer the two reprieves, you must press both buttons at once in the box before you.
however, in doing so you'll give a sacrifice of your own.
two can live, four will die.
your decision's symbolized by the blood on your hands.
Mr. Easton, wake up! You gotta get us out of here!
pick me! - Mr. Easton, come on!
listen to me. Mr. Easton, I am the one who should live.
do something! - Fuck.
Jesus Christ!
please, Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton! Please!
follow the policy, Mr. Easton. Do it!
please! Mr. Easton, follow the policy! Follow the policy!
holy shit! - Oh, my God!
No! - Oh, my God!
what the fuck!
what the fuck! - No!
Mr. E! They say we're only as strong as the weakest link!
I'm the strongest! You can't let me die!
fuck him! I'm healthy, sir. I'm healthy! Please!
Mr. Easton, come on!
no, I have two kids. You know them well. Please!
please, they can't grow up without me! They need me!
Oh, shit!
thank you! Thank you!
fucking hell! - Thank you.
fuck her! You don't even know her, Mr. Easton.
listen to me, okay? My parents are sick, okay?
they need me. I'm all they have, please! - You fucking liar!
your parents hate you! They cut you off! - What?
shut up! That's not true! - Fuck you, it is true. I sit next to you!
I... I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant! - No, she's not! She's lying!
she's fucking lying! - Fuck you!
Mr. Easton, she is lying! - I'm pregnant!
she's lying. - No! No, fuck!
I'm pregnant! - She's fucking lying!
he's lying. Mr. Easton, it's not true! Please! Please!
fuck! Push the thing! Push the thing!
she's lying. - No!
Mr. Easton, push it! Push the thing! - Oh, God! No!
push it!
Oh, God! What the...
what the fuck!
you have to trust me! I won't lie to you!
Oh, please! He's a kiss-ass! - Mr. Easton! My parents are loaded!
Oh, God! - They'll give you whatever you want!
just say a number! - He's a thief!
he's been stealing from the company for years!
it's true! It's true! It's true! It's true!
thief! - Fuck you!
it's true! He has been... - Don't listen to them!
don't isten to them, Mr. E! - It's true!
Christ! Mr. Easton, come on! Mr. Easton...
okay, Mr Easton, isten to me carefully. I'm on your side, and I can help you.
but you cannot trust this bitch! - What? Fuck you!
she's a fucking liar! - What?
you cannot believe her. She has already tried to lie!
and she's just going to continue to do it! You know it!
it's me, Josh!
no, I haven't! What about you? He wants to be you! Okay, you know that!
but he'll slit your throat at the first opportunity!
please don't let me die! Please! No, please!
Oh, my God! - Oh, fuck!
Oh, God!
thank you!
Oh, well, that's it, isn't it? It's over!
you motherfucker! - Stop it!
you spineless, pussy-whipped motherfucker!
that's all it takes, eh? A bitch says one thing and it's all over!
you know what, William? Your policy, it's bullshit!
fucking bullshit!
well, you listen to me, you son of a bitch!
I did everything for you.
look at me! When you're killing me, you look at me!
thank you.
Oh, my God!
thank you. - Emily.
right now, you're feeling helpless.
right now, you're feeling helpless.
right now, you're feeling helpless.
right now, you're feeling helpless.
how's it going? - Good.
this is it.
whoever made this tape had access to some very impressive audio-filtration equipment.
right now, you're feeling helpless.
fortunately, we have some tricks of our own here.
we can turn his algorithm upside down and let us hear what he really sounds like.
let's hear what you got.
right now, you're feeling helpless.
you okay?
you seem a little preoccupied.
I'm just anxious about the tape.
right now, you're feeling helpless.
right now, you're feeling helpless. - You know, there are still a couple of things - I can't quite wrap my head around. - Right now, you're feeling helpless.
like, I don't understand Strahm's motivation.
he was my partner for five years.
I mean, we all knew he was a bit of a hothead.
but I never saw any indication of psychotic behavior.
you never can really tell what someone's thinking on the inside.
...helpless.
hear that? - Right now, you're feeling helpless.
we're getting there.
come on, I thought you had something to show us.
Yeah, it's just I never really thought of him as being vengeful.
right now, you're feeling helpless. - You know? I mean, all the facts are there.
but something doesn't sit right. - Listen. It's getting closer.
right now, you're feeling... - You know, there is an alternative.
let's say that Strahm killed Seth Baxter specifically to set you up as an accomplice to Jigsaw.
okay.
well, there's a problem with that, though.
on further analysis of Strahm's fingerprints, it was found that the uric acid levels in the eccrine gland residue were inconsistent for an individual with an active epidermal metabolism.
in other words?
in other words, when he left his fingerprints on the latest victim,
Strahm was already dead.
right now, you're feeling helpless. - There it is.
right now, you're feeling helpless.
who else knows about me?
who else fucking knows about me?
everyone. - You lie. You're fucking lying.
I found something you'll want to see.
it was at the location where John died.
does it mean anything to you?
what are you doing?
get as far away from the sprinkler head as possible.
we don't know what it does!
I'm not gonna just sit here and do nothing.
we need to make a decision! Don't you understand?
okay. You can pull it. I love you.
I love you, too. Get back.
no. You don't know what it does!
on three, I'll pull it. - Okay.
no. No.
what the fuck?
it doesn't even work! It doesn't even fucking work!
what the fuck?
it doesn't make any fucking sense.
I think I know what it does.
get used to me, cause I'm not going anywhere.
you sure about that?
Amanda will fail you.
we'll see.
Amanda, you were with Cecil the night Jill lost Gideon.
go.
what the fuck are you doing? Go. Go. - I don't know about this.
what do you mean, you don't know? - She's been good to us.
I've been good to you.
I know... - Please, please, go.
you drive me crazy.
go on, you fucking pussy! Go! Go! Go!
Cecil! No! - Listen to me!
you killed their child.
you know it and I know it, so do exactly as I say.
kill Lynn Denlon or I will tell John what you did.
she doesn't deserve to go free!
Amanda, Lynn is more important than you know.
Lynn!
I made it. I made it. I made it!
if you fail, you will never see your family again.
what are you doing here? - Will!
Pamela! - Yeah.
I know it's your birthday. I'm going to make it up to you, I promise.
are you really standing up your sister for work? I'm your only family.
are you all right? - Yeah.
let her go! I mean it! I won!
I followed your fucking rules! Now you let her go!
you son of a bitch!
you've just given me a death sentence. I mean, who's going to cover me now?
you just killed me.
come on, let's go.
you're the man that killed my dad.
Hello, Tara. My apologies for exposing you and your son to this kind of treatment.
but I can assure you, it is not without reason.
the man before you just made the sacrifices to save the life of a loved one.
however, when given the opportunity to save your husband's life, he chose not to.
now you will be given the power to save a life.
will you grant this man the opportunity to continue living?
or will you dispense the same death sentence he issued your husband?
live or die.
the choice is yours.
it's not my game.
I'm leaving you a box today, and its contents are of grave importance.
miss Tuck, what's in the box?
please. Please forgive me.
have mercy, please!
did he show mercy when my husband was suffering?
John left you five envelopes.
the sixth one was for me.
this is John's will.
...to watch this horror!
he had no choice! - He always had a choice!
the reason I am doing this isn't because I can't forgive you for what you did to me.
the reason I'm doing this is because I couldn't forgive myself for what you might do to someone else.
please, no. Please.
you will never kill again. - Please.
please.
please.
please.
please. Please.
I can't. I can't kill him.
but I can.
no, Brent! - You killed my father, you motherfucker!
now you burn in hell.
game over.
John Kramer. - William Easton.
nice to meet you.
those are the rules, Harold. - You've just given me a death sentence.
so, in a sense, you choose who lives or dies.
No!
it's policy, John. It's policy.
you think it's the living who will have ultimate judgment over you, because the dead will have no claim over your soul, but you may be mistaken.
so when's your test, Detective?
I don't need one. - Oh, yeah?
you know why you're here, don't you?
I want to know if you have what it takes to survive.
you feel you now have control, don't you?
you think you will walk away untested.
do you like how brutality feels, Mark?
I'm only carrying out John's final request.
you want a chance? I'll give you a chance.
go on, kiss the baby for us.
kiss your wife.
go ahead, Lionel. Any news?
I spoke to Remi. We have to act fast before the gold leaves Guyana.
canadian Gold's 3 sending it to Switzerland.
OK, I'm on my way to delivery gas to them.
they have no idea.
you get the others. I'll call from Cayenne.
Roger.
that was Virgil to know if we needed gas.
I said he's too dear.
tell him to stop working with illegals.
he'll get caught.
gentlemen...
Hi, Roger.
how are things? - OK, you?
Thanks.
beer? - You bet.
you're late.
you can still pay up.
pay him for his 3 barrels of gas.
they're here.
Hi, Maurice. - Hi.
the equipment's here.
thank you.
I'll pick it up later.
I'm not asking any questions.
I should hope not, at that price!
enjoy your meal.
gotta wait for the gas. The cops are onto me.
I'm quitting, anyway.
I'm retiring.
we're not going into the jungle, I hope.
good to see you.
hear about Miguel?
3 months after Zimbabwe, he shot himself.
all by himself!
scared you'll be next?
I quit. I got a restaurant now.
it's in the South of France.
look. Business is booming.
that's why you're here!
I get bored when I stay still.
I won't spend my life serving seafood!
is Lionel still around?
looking for gold.
how is he?
married.
but he's in.
couldn't you find anyone else?
no-one as efficient.
OK, pal?
you met?
let's go.
Where'd you come from?
Caracas.
what's wrong with planes?
I'm not in a hurry.
why don't you tell us your plan?
600 kilos of gold.
it's virtually a good deed, because Canadian Gold doesn't just mine gold.
it also recycles the garimperios gold.
it buys it for 13, 000 euros a kilo in the jungle and sells it for 20, 000 in Switzerland.
the illegals' money launderer!
the mine's 30 minutes from the Brazilian border by chopper.
I first wanted to hit them at the airport in Cayenne, but the police would've got us in no time.
now we'll be in Rio before they realize.
the main quality of gold is, it isn't traceable once it's been melted down.
2 hours after we get the gold, we'll have the paperwork and can dance a samba...
with 120 kilos each.
what about the equipment?
it's being dealt with.
how many people?
with Lionel, 5.
120 kilos of gold, what's that worth?
just over 2 million euros.
each!
good wine!
Virgil to Lionel come in, Lionel.
Roger.
we're all here except you.
I got something to do first, but don't worry, I'm coming.
listen...
you're going to Paris tomorrow.
wait for my call.
she mustn't work. How many times must I tell you?
she's pregnant.
beat it!
no, Camille!
Camille!
what do you want?
to say goodbye.
I'm sorry.
canadian Gold offers better guarantees.
we applied first.
how can you work such a big area?
I'll find a way.
the police say that last month, you took an injured illegal to the hospital.
a 15-year-old kid.
he had a broken arm. He came to us, asking for help.
what should I have done?
let it go gangrenous?
you're suspected of fraternizing with illegals.
what?
are you shitting me?
they just killed my husband.
I have no choice but to cancel your permit.
in the circumstances...
I'm sorry.
you're stealing my concession.
I know it's hard for you.
but please watch what you say.
do you realize what you're doing?
I'm up to my neck in debt.
it's all I had left.
maybe I could get you a job at city hall.
that's all very well, but the gold won't wait.
and the guy who got the equipment?
Maurice? I don't think so.
he has too much to lose.
I can get you a pro within 48 hours if I make a few phone calls.
we can't wait that long. They move the gold in the next 3 days.
they've already moved the rest.
gotta do it sooner.
or we forget it.
we'll never get a chance like it.
I'll replace Lionel.
why are you here?
canadian Gold stole our concession.
they got the garimpeiros to attack us.
Hey, Virgil, what's going on?
who is this?
Lionel's wife.
she gets his share.
shut up!
there's 5 of us now.
aren't you on vacation?
I took a day off.
I had a date.
was she pretty?
tell us. - Later.
you're here, take it.
it ain't the South of France!
why did you hole up there, anyway?
I wanted to buy a hotel in Morocco, but that's too gay!
well, right now you're supposed to be a Swiss banker.
Thanks.
beer?
2
What're you doing here?
I've come to do business.
I brought you a buyer.
how'd you like to make some money?
shoot
how are things?
whenever I supply gas,
I take a load back.
wanna buy my gold?
it's safer and costs less in transport.
I bet I can make you a better deal.
maybe I already have a better deal!
this is Mr Ziegler who came here in person to make you an offer.
where you from? - Zurich.
I already do a lot of business in Brazil.
how much will you pay?
well, the official rate.
my gold isn't.
it could be. That's my job.
what quantity?
as much as you can get.
I should ask you that.
why should I trust you?
cause you know me.
they're here.
be back on Tuesday with gas.
think it over in the meantime.
interested in gold now?
I want to be rich.
you're not cut out for it.
you just want the thrill.
why do I work with you?
don't turn around.
should I have used a Swiss accent?
St Laurent, this is Melchior.
go ahead, Melchior.
are the quads there?
Yes, I just saw them.
you should check the delivery.
OK, I'll do that.
feel free to help!
what's the dumb bitch up to?
no idea.
mina...
it's me.
it's me.
I say we leave her.
let's go.
we've been hit.
come in, Melchior. We've been hit!
look out!
what the hell are you doing?
don't wait for her!
they're firing at us!
stabilize the chopper!
stabilize it!
for fuck's sake, Virgil!
now?
wait.
we're gonna die!
Virgil, now, dammit!
go!
now!
we coulda been killed!
you're crazy! All that for some whore!
she worked for me.
calm down.
we made it.
I'm not so sure. We were hit.
we're too heavy to reach Brazil.
you better explain.
nothing to explain.
you shoulda let me blow 'em up sooner.
hands off, you whore!
don't say that!
I'll say whatever I like!
it's your fault we're in shit.
don't go bustin' our balls!
you got your guy killed...
shut up!
shut the fuck up!
give that to me.
give it to me.
drop it.
scumbag!
they must know we landed.
we need another chopper.
check if you have a signal.
check if you have a signal.
no.
they'll come for us.
we gotta move.
and fast.
there's just one small problem.
600 kilos of gold.
do we carry it on our backs?
we'll make stretchers.
we won't make it.
she's right.
we're going too slow.
and we're leaving very clear tracks.
OK, there's only one thing for it.
gotta bury it.
bullshit!
we'll get it later.
I don't like the idea of...
going empty-handed. What if we can't come back?
we don't have to bury it all.
Yeah, OK.
we each take what we can carry: 20 to 30 kilos.
we bury the rest.
the border is about 60 kms away.
we rent a chopper in Brazil and come back for the gold.
why only take 20 kilos?
we can take 30, 40 or 50 each!
up to you - you're carrying it.
goddam ants!
don't touch my share!
thank you.
here's the coordinates.
2 degrees north, 33 minutes 58 seconds.
53 degrees west, 48 minutes 10 seconds.
if we go south, we come to the Sapucai.
we follow it to the sea.
mining policy is bullshit now.
in South Africa, they go 3, 000 meters underground.
500 deaths a year. Know why?
cause the multinationals dictate the conditions.
Communist?
no, geologist, but I know them.
truth is, we've given up on the miners.
when you're with armed men, don't talk politics.
you'll live longer!
the thousands of illegals in this jungle all have radios.
right now, they all want us dead.
they have better things to do than chase us.
they just want to feed their families.
shut up and move.
got a train to catch?
know where you're going?
d'you want to do it?
shit!
fuck!
it bit me! Shit, it bit me!
it's not dangerous. He'll just have a fever.
what if she's wrong? - Then you'll die!
the river!
8 kms in 6 hours!
at this rate, it'll take us a week!
what, then?
do we call a cab?
we let the current carry us along.
I'm not doing that, with all the crap in there.
there's not more in there than out here.
let's camp here.
it'll be dark in 2 hours.
OK.
we leave at dawn.
you're right, let's go now before they catch up with us.
don't worry.
Georges will make a safety zone.
you need to rest.
I'll come with you.
I'll find us something to eat.
you love it, too, don't you?
the Wayanas call it the flesh of God.
great!
saints' halos,
egyptian sarcophaguses,
byzantine icons, statues of Buddha,
inca temples...
same in every civilization.
the symbol of purity and perfection!
I've heard that crap for 25 years!
gold is an alloy of blood and sweat.
this shit feeds on corpses.
it changes without any scruples.
gold teeth from the gas chambers became baby's bracelets, baptism medallions.
or your wedding ring!
who said you could touch that?
I'll give her some.
what?
squandering your fortune?!
what's she up to?
it repels mesquites.
Oh, yeah?
maybe we did her well to bring her!
she can use the hammock in there.
Thanks.
the rafts are ready.
what did I say?
you keep watch first.
it's me.
here.
why give 'em to me?
so you can cut 'em up!
why did you wait for me?
you'd be in Brazil now.
I didn't wait for you.
it takes time to take off.
Thanks, all the same.
he said he came to Guiana because of you.
Yeah.
there was a job protecting the space center.
he stayed on to look for gold.
he found you.
he did all that for you.
who're you doing it for?
for me.
I don't believe you.
it's true. - It's not about the gold.
Yeah.
I can believe that.
are we gonna make it?
there's a price on our heads.
there's plenty of bastards here.
usually they kill for a few grams, so for 600 kilos...
they'll come after us for the reward.
not very optimistic!
shut up, dammit!
fuckin' jungle!
we've reached the forbidden zone.
it's a sanctuary to protect the Indians. We can't go on.
they stole 600 kilos of gold.
I informed Paris.
down there is where it's happening.
they have no chance of survival.
if you can't find them, we will!
the gold! The fuckin' gold!
I can't see very well.
don't touch.
what is it?
what?
you must've touched an urticant plant.
is it serious?
I can't see a thing!
there were at least 30 kilos of gold!
it'll be alright.
it'll be alright...
he'll go blind if he's not treated.
what if we leave them the gold?
it's not the gold!
it's that Indian!
we should leave her here!
ask your pals. I bet they agree with me.
I'm sick of your shit.
now we do as I say!
who is it?
let me.
here.
shoulda let me do it.
they're just poachers.
since when did you care about being nasty?
shoulda killed 'em. They saw us.
they'll tell the garimpeiros.
they're not the problem.
what do you mean?
I mean I used to work for mining groups.
they're hard bastards.
a gold mine is a money-making machine.
all in cash.
politicians, secret services...
they all get a cut.
we just stole some of it.
they're gonna send in the pros.
a gold mine must be impregnable. Now there's a precedent.
you can't blame us for a bunch of adventurers.
you don't command enough respect.
in South Africa, we were never hit.
they know we use Melchior to buy the illegals' gold.
we can't risk that getting out.
if they don't get out alive, they won't talk.
yeah...
I know this place.
2 ethnologists lived here with the Wayanas.
I supplied them with fuel.
and that can help us, can it?
maybe.
but what're we doing here?
there's a police barrage upstream.
we didn't see it.
maybe the Indians ate them!
what the hell is this?
what the hell is this?
what's going on?
the river...
it changed direction.
the tide!
the tide can make it change direction.
I didn't think it could so far from the shore.
so, we've gone the wrong way?
Yeah.
we've gone upriver.
the sea's the other way.
if we go back, we've wasted 2 days.
you said yourself they're after us! We have to carry on.
to go where? The source? Jerk!
it's every man for himself.
we stick together!
what if we go our own way and you get the gold?
and forget to share it?
calling me a thief?
think about it. It works both ways.
you're wasting your breath.
who asked you, Ray Charles?
you've had it, you hear? Had it!
maybe.
but we go together.
let go of him, Enzo.
let go of him.
Enzo, please.
OK...
I'll keep watch first.
they went the wrong way. They're going upstream.
I've been thinking.
if we ever get out of this fuckin' mess,
I'm quittin' all this shit.
anyway, I got nothing else to prove.
here, you should...
come see me in the South of France.
I'll do you a bourride.
my specialty.
it's damn good.
you take...
fuckin' jungle...
What're you doing?
I'm going after him.
What're you talking about? You can't see a thing.
you can help me.
don't worry, the jungle will see to him.
our priority is to keep going.
no.
the baby's due.
do what you like.
I'm staying with her.
give me your phones.
mine's dead.
give it to me, anyway.
give me an hour.
shit!
Hello?
can't hear a thing!
Maurice, it's Virgil.
I need help.
forget it.
its business, not charity.
everyone knows you did it.
10 k's of gold for a chopper to Brazil.
the cops questioned me.
I can't help you.
hurry up.
if I lose the signal, I've had it.
20 k's.
deal.
where are you?
the inselberg near the forbidden zone.
OK.
I I'll be there at dawn.
alright.
Where's the rest of the gold?
don't touch me!
Enzo, it's me!
it's alright now.
I'll get Enzo.
I'll be right back.
try to sleep.
I won't go without you.
I was wrong about you.
is that a compliment?
just think...
Carl I SSS?
don't worry.
I know a good clinic in Rio.
I'll just take a look.
why did you wait for me?
go to sleep.
there he is.
Maurice sold us out.
Why?
they're military choppers.
hide!
that was reconnaissance. They'll be back.
if they sent choppers, the commandos are on the river.
so?
I stink of gangrene.
if they hospitalize me, they might save my arm.
we'll tell the police we ' re garimpeiros.
with the baby, they might take us by canoe as far as Brazil!
it might work.
come on.
why are you doing this?
I called them.
they'll hunt me down.
if they hunt me down, they'll find you three.
I always thought Lionel was a lucky man.
you don't know me very well.
take them away.
since 1970, the federal witness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population, and that is, somebody wants them dead.
Hawaii Six Months Ago Leguame, you worry too much.
fine.
just bring the stones, and we'll take care of business.
Lord.
I can't believe you're defiling our honeymoon with this nasty business.
sweetheart, this nasty business is what keeps you in this lifestyle.
I don't care about that.
I don't care if we have to live in a tent.
I only care about you.
baby, I'm sorry.
now, this meeting will just take a few minutes.
Treena, sweetie, come on now. - No, no, David.
it's-it's immoral and it's dangerous, and if-- if anything ever happened to you.
David, you've got to promise me this will be it.
please promise me this is the last one of these deals you'll ever make.
all right.
I promise.
thank you.
I love you so much.
beautiful, Leguame.
of course.
sweetheart, would you put these in the safe, please?
Yes, darling.
then I'm headed down to the pool.
come find me when you're done? - Sure.
nice meeting you, gentlemen.
the pleasure was ours.
it's all right. I trust her.
obviously. With your life.
can I help you, Miss?
do you have it?
gracias.

Lord.
special agent Bob Carlton, FBI.
you're under arrest for fraud, grand theft, and five counts of bigamy.
lady, you have no idea how long I've been trying to nail you.
I get that a lot.
agent Carlton, if I told you where to find $20 million worth of illegal conflict diamonds along with the men conspiring to sell them, you think we might be able to work out some deal?
WITSEC ID: TREENA HORRIS, CASE: US GOVERNMENT INDICT NGWAMA MUBUTU.
Albuquerque
Oh, Bob, what are you doing?
what's he doing here?
apparently he got special permission to escort his witness.
permission? Permission from whom?
and why would he do that?
FBI agents aren't even supposed to know their witness's location.
you want I should draw you a picture?
Oh, no.
God, I hate con artists even more than murderers.
well, if it isn't two of the laziest marshals west of the Pecos.
Hi, Bob. - Robert.
Mary, this is Treena Morris.
AkaTtress Stevenson.
nice to meet you.
miss Morris, this memorandum of understanding constitutes the entire agreement between you and the U. S. Marshal Service.
it lays out our obligations to you and your requirements to maintain status as a protected witness.
any questions before we begin?
I was actually- - good. Let's get started.
you may not contact anyone from your past.
that means friends, family members, no one.
Oh, well, that one shouldn't be a problem.
now then, I want you to understand something.
this program is an opportunity very few people get.
a shot at a fresh start, a do-over on your entire life, but it only works if you make the decision to be a better human being than you've been, and allow the possibility of something greater for yourself.
and as impossible as it may seem,
I've seen even bigger scumbags than you do just that and make it stick.
well, I appreciate that.
your husband swore under oath you stole $10 million worth of raw diamonds.
if that's true, now would be a good time to turn those over.
sugar, even if I had the alleged diamonds, what exactly would be the upside of me handing them over to you?
well, aside from the fact that there's people out there who want to kill you over those diamonds, the upside would be starting out with a clean slate.
trust me, you hang on to garbage from your past, sooner or later, it'll start to stink...
sugar.
you're actually very pretty.
how do you think I'd look as a blonde?
shouldn't you be getting back to Dallas, Bob?
Nina and the boys must miss you, don't you think?
well, I guess I'll check on you in a couple of weeks.
Bye, Bob.
Bye, Mary Stan.
before you screw up and I send you off to prison.
give what six months?
before you screw up and I send you off to prison.
present Day
says here your boyfriend's hitting streak has the attention of several major league teams and his ascension to the bigs is imminent.
good for him.
what? I'm happy for him.
really.
obviously.
and he's not my boyfriend.
what you looking at, squish? - What?
nothing. I'm reading. Mind your own business.
you know, if you're gonna use a magazine as a prop, you might want to pick one a little more believable.
uh, what, you think I have no interest in financials?
finances. Investing?
what's that article about?
it's about the pros and cons of tax-free annuities as part of a long-term investment strategy, smart ass.
and don't ask me what a tax-free annuity is because I haven't gotten to that part yet.
does it say anything in there about getting a job as part of a long-term investment strategy?
now you're just being mean.
Oh, for god sakes.
Hey, these are my mambo pants.
what? Did I not tell you I'm taking mambo lessons?
I'm pretty sure that would have registered.
all right, let's go. I've got to get my car into the shop by 9: 00
if I'm gonna make my massage.
why do you just keep throwing good money after bad into that piece of junk?
well, because like my family, I love it a little more than I want it dead.
can we go, please? - Fine.
you know how Marshall lives to schlep.
wait. - What?
keep your hands off my Sudoku.
look. That's my witness, Treena.
very attractive.
Hey, did you forget to tell her the part about no pictures in the newspaper, 'cause it's kind of a big witness no-no.
I'm just saying.
Treena, I'm Mary.
u. S.Marshal Mary Shepherd.
Oh, that Mary Shepherd.
Yes, I did see your wedding announcement.
Yeah, beautiful photo.
Hey, where are you right now? What's the address?
stay there. I'm coming over.
curious.
can someone do me?
I will. - I will.
the reason I despise con artists more than any of the other garden variety miscreants
I see on a daily basis is because robbing people of their worldly possessions isn't enough for them.
they don't just leave their victims destitute.
they leave them feeling foolish, betrayed.
sweetie, if it were up to you, I'd walk down the aisle in a G-string and pasties.
no. No, no, no, no. No pasties.
Lord, my son is such a pig.
Oh, don't say that. He's not--well, he is a pig, but he's my pig.
mostly I hate con artists because they break their victims' hearts.
Mary! Sweetie!
it's so good to see you!
cut the sweetie crap. We need to talk. Alone.
aren't you sweet?
everyone, this is Mary, my best friend from college and maid of honor.
I was just telling everyone all about you.
well, not everything. I still want them to like you.
let me introduce you.
this porcine stud is my fiancé Mark.
it's great to finally meet you. - And you.
and this elderly woman is my future mother-in-law Deandra, the wealthiest drunk in New Mexico.
welcome to my home, Mary. And please call me Dee.
only my son's whores are required to call me Deandra.
Oh, good one.
Thanks, Dee.
Mary, would you like something to drink? A bloody Mary? Beer?
how about a bloody beer?
no, nothing for me. I have to get back to work.
could I talk to you for a minute, please?
what do you do for work, Mary?
she's a U. S. Marshal. How hot is that?
a marshal. How interesting.
a word, please?
nice to meet all of you.
easy, darling. I bruise.
what the hell is wrong with you?
what? Didn't you like them?
knock it off. You know the script.
we're casual acquaintances, someone you met when we first came to town.
you don't make up B. S. Stories about our history for your amusement.
come on, I was just having some fun. They don't care.
you're right, Treena.
you should go back inside and enjoy the rest of your last day in Albuquerque.
wait. Why?
for one, you violated your security by allowing your picture to appear in the newspaper.
there wasn't anything I could do about it.
besides, this is Albuquerque.
good lord, I wrote papers in high school that had a higher circulation.
funny. Two, you violated my security me as a marshal.
well, I hate to be the bearer.
don't screw with me, Treena.
people's lives, including yours, depend on me staying anonymous.
and three, there's no way in hell I'll allow you to ruin another man's life.
not on my watch.
I'm not. I love Mark. I really do.
Really? As much as you loved your last five husbands?
this is different, I swear.
sorry, Treena, I'm afraid you don't have much cred with me.
this time tomorrow, you're either on a plane to a new location or you're out of the program.
end of discussion.
Hey, Raf, nice write-up in the paper, huh?
Yeah, how about that?
how does it feel to have a famous boyfriend?
when I get a boyfriend, I'll let you know.
raf, you still there?
listen, I actually did get called up to the marlins today.
I leave for Florida in a few days.
Really? A few days? That's great. Congratulations.
Yep.
so why don't you come over tonight to, you know, celebrate?
sure, of course, yeah. I'll swing by after work.
sounds good.
Bye. - Bye.
Hey, where's Stan?
Hey, Stan? - Hey, Mary.
listen, about Treena Morris. - Stan, look, I want to talk to you about Treena Morris.
we can't kick her out of the program. - I want her out of the program.
what? - What?
how'd you know about Treena? - I just got off the phone with major Carlton.
she called Bob Carlton?
what? - What?
Oh, you heard me.
excellent. Now tell me again, which one of you is Costello?
What--what do you think you're doing?
it's called the mambo, Stan. I started taking lessons.
well, anyway, your witness threatened to go to Bob Carlton's wife if we do anything to upset her impending nuptials.
so let her go to Bob's wife.
I'll go to her too and tell her Treena's a lying sociopath.
who do you think she's gonna believe?
normally I'd say you, but Treena's got video.
apparently it's some very, very artsy camerawork.
what--what-- what are you doing?
stop that. Stop that right now.
man, why you gotta harsh my mellow?
you're a U. S. Marshal, for god's sake.
so? - So the peacock struts.
if you're gonna dance, then by god, dance.
that's it, come on. That's good.
Dah-dah-dah 5, 6, 7, 8...
Congratulations.
so you got called up. - Yep.
God, you must be jazzed.
I know I'm jazzed.
come on in. Let's sit down.
what's with the glum?
did the deal fall through? - No. Nothing like that.
well, then cut it out. Come on, this is a happy moment.
I'm not gonna let you screw it up. Quit moping.
let's make the most of the time we have left.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
this isn't how I want it to go. - Oh, okay. You want to be on top?
you want to incorporate that?
just take a bite.
it's delicious, from this new fancy cupcake place.
have you been drinking? - Come on, try it.
I don't want that. I want this.
no, no, no, no, no. First this, then this.
Oh, for god's sakes. Okay.
there. Now, come on.
wait, wait, no. Take--take another bite.
Rafael, I don't want the damn cupcake.
what are you doing? - Marry me.
Rafael, that's not funny. - It's not a joke.
marry me. - My god.
marry me.
shut up and put that away.
marry me. - No. Stop saying that.
Mary, will you please marry me?
no. God damn it, Raf!
you don't just get married just--just--just because someone gets called up to the major leagues.
what the hell's wrong with you? Jeez!
happily ever after-- the big lie.
those three insidious words repeated again and again, promising myself and a gazillion other little girls that someday, sure as the sunset, a man prettier than ourselves would sweep us away to live our lives forever and a day, blah blah blah, never once mentioning the years of quiet desperation that surely followed, which is why I pray with all my soul that whomever invented the lethal mantra, "happily ever after," died penniless, face down in the gutter with cats gnawing on his ears.
please, you must stand up straight.
is wedding, not funeral.
Yeah, we'll see.
Hey, Raf, it's me again.
I wish you'd call me back.
okay. Bye.
what?
I don't know who that is.
Mary! Where are you
u. S. Marshal! Stop!
mother...
Oh, my god, what happened?
come with me.
Ouch! Easy.
who was that, Treena?
I have no idea.
men take pictures of me all the time. It's a cross I bear.
listen to me. As much as personally I couldn't care less what happens to you, professionally, you're my responsibility, and that is something I take very seriously.
now tell me straight-- is there anybody in Albuquerque - you've swindled, robbed, or conned in the last six months? - No.
have you made contact with anybody from your past? - No.
then I have to assume that man has something to do with the people whose diamonds you stole.
I didn't steal any diamonds. For Pete's sake.
I'm about to marry one of the richest men in New Mexico.
why on earth would I keep a bag of illegal diamonds?
I don't know.
maybe because you're a soul-sucking waste of oxygen with no regard for anybody but yourself.
now get ready.
I'm taking you back to your mother-in-law's fortress until I can figure out who that was.
where are my mother-humping clothes?
you are dangerously close to being kicked out of the wedding party.
man, I'd like five minutes alone with the idiot that invented crinoline.
actually, crinoline wasn't an invention so much as it was a discovery.
Jesus, shut your hole.
and once again, the incurious mind rears its blissed-out head.
did you come up with anything on the photographer?
not yet. Maybe he was just a guy taking pictures.
Yeah, so why'd he run?
and then try to run me over?
probably just a reaction to you in that dress.
so I, uh, understand we have a paparazzi problem?
maybe. Probably.
well, where did you stash her?
the mother-in-law's.
she refused to go anywhere else.
the good news is, the place is like a fortress, and I doubled up on the security detail.
and the bad news is, there are about 1, 000 photographer in the greater Albuquerque area registered to middle-aged white males.
man, how the hell are we supposed to process that many leads?
maybe we can get some help from downstairs, huh?
I've already polled every available body for tonight.
uh, so, Inspectors, carry on.
Yeah.
what just happened? - I don't know.
Yeah.
Hey, you got a minute?
not really. What do you think about this?
okay, what about
so, um, I just wanted to talk to you about my situation.
Chuck and I are sort of going through a thing right now and, um, well, first of all, I want to thank you for letting me hang out here the past few weeks.
and second of all, you want to know if you can hang out a little longer?
well, yeah, that.
but also, I was wondering if you could help me.
um, it's just that your life is so together, and I feel like you might be good at helping me get my life going in a new direction, maybe.
look, I gotta find something to wear and get out of here, but let me think about it, and we can talk tomorrow or the next day, okay?
okay. Thanks.
Oh, god, what do you wear to these things?
what things? - You know, some froufrou slut fest.
well, what kind of slut fest? Regular slut, fancy slut, euro trash slut?
never mind.
you leave everything to me, grasshopper.
Jesus, you look hot.
I look like a whore. - Yeah.
what are you doing here?
just keeping an eye on the door till the other marshals get
holy jeez. My god.
okay, fine. Get it all out.
what? You look nice.
you got anything new to report?
um, not much.
Treena's ex is still safely ensconced in Leavenworth.
Interpol and the FBI think the African and his pal are lying low and could be on the ivory coast, but they can't say for sure.
translation-- the guys who most want to get their hands on Treena are nowhere to be found?
exactly. - Terrific.
so I'll be out here and you...
what are you doing? - What? Nothing.
I'm doing my job, keeping an eye on things.
look at me. - What? No. Why?
because I'm talking to you.
Oh, my god. You can't look at me.
Marshall, for god's sakes, it's not like I'm naked.
naked would be better.
that makes me feel so... dirty.
good lord. Watch the door, pervert.
why so glum, sugarplum? I'm not mad at you anymore.
Oh, wait.
Hey, Dee.
did I ever tell you about how Mary got an "a" in psychology class?
no.
careful. I'm not in the mood.
Long-tongued, I am.
so we're studying psychosexual archetypes, and Mary is definitely gonna flunk this class.
then one day, she comes to class dressed as the classic catholic school girl.
I'm warning you.
shush. I'm talking butt-high pleated skirt, anklets.
then this little minx sits in the front row.
total commando.
I am talking the full basic instinct.
needless to say, guess who got an "a" and a free trip to Europe.
no, way. That's not true.
absolutely true.
she showed him heaven, so he showed her Paris. Didn't you?
Yeah, that was fun. Yeah.
gosh. Now tell them about the special tutoring session you had with the same professor every Friday in our dorm room for an entire semester and how he still flunked you.
absolutely true, isn't it, sugarplum?
well played. All right, then, game on.
bring it, bitch.
excuse me, ladies.
I have a warrant for the arrest of miss Treena Morris.
God, Treena, now what'd you do?
cut to the chase, flatfoot.
show me what you got.
miss Morris, you're under arrest for the multiple violations of the New Mexico penal code.
you have the right to remain sexy.
Oh, hey, what are you doing in here?
you're missing out on all the fun.
Yeah. Actually, I went to a strip club at lunch.
I'm all stripped out.
Oh, come on. It's just a little harmless fun.
mark knows I would never cheat on him.
he thinks he knows that because he thinks he knows you.
everything you've told him is a lie.
what about you?
what about that lecture you gave me on the importance of your anonymity?
does your family know what you do?
does your boyfriend, your girlfriend, whatever.
it's different. I maintain an alias to protect the people I care about.
you do it to swindle the people who care about you.
I started lying a long time before I learned how much men will give up for a pretty face.
I didn't start lying to pull scams, and you didn't start hiding yourself when you became a marshal.
that's just how you justify it.
if you weren't a marshal, you'd have some other excuse.
it's tough, really tough.
a career and a family and trying to maintain a relationship.
it's practically-- well, you know.
I mean, you're in law enforcement.
what are you doing? You been drinking?
no. I'm just commiserating with officer
I'm sorry, what's your name again?
and don't say dick. - Excuse us.
or peter. To be continued.
rod. That's it.
sad thing is the guy's actually Albuquerque P. D. Moonlighting.
so what's up?
you have a visitor.
Oh, man. What's Dershowitz doing here?
good question. Let me know when you find out.
Holy- - all right, can it, detective.
I'm obviously attending a party.
in what capacity?
what happened? Why are you here?
just for fun, how about we answer the second question first?
whatever blows your skirt up?
good god.
and here comes the answer to the first question.
we found him dead in a motel room.
our forensics experts believe that the deceased took one look at you in that dress, then hired somebody to shoot him in the head.
no doubt.
anyway, his name is Jay Kelly. He's a P. I. From Dallas.
based on incoming calls on his cell, he was working for some south Africans.
that mean anything to you?
re, maybe this will jog something loose.
not that you deserve it.
could This Be Your Girlfriend?
so am I to infer that New Mexico's most eligible bachelor is betrothed to one of your newly-minted citizens?
thank you. - You're welcome.
lock the party down. Nobody in or out.
the Africans are in town.
Stan will be here in a minute.
Hey, I'm making a documentary!
please help me!
look, Treena, something's come up. The weddings off.
what are you talking about?
that man at the bridal shop was working for the Africans.
he was murdered.
they're most certainly here in Albuquerque.
well, then find them, but you can't call off my wedding.
look, you rode the scam as far as you could, okay, but the whole thing's unraveling now.
it's time to cut your losses and skedaddle. Let's go.
no, no. God, no, please.
I know what I've been. I know what you think I am.
but just listen to me.
six months ago, you said I should allow for the possibility of something greater.
and it took me a while, but I finally figured out what you meant.
great. We'll have to compare notes sometime.
after I met mark, I realized what you meant was, quit being such a goddamn coward.
have the courage to stand right next to someone you care about, this close, without guile, defenseless, and risk total annihilation.
and now partly because of you, miracle of miracles,
I actually managed to drop the stones to allow this wonderful man into my heart.
that's mark. He's probably checking up on me.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, honey, quick question.
did you steal $10 million worth of diamonds?
where are you?
at Tom-Tom's. At the boys'.
there's a couple of guys here who say they knew you in a past life.
mark. Oh, my god.
what? What, what?
the diamond smugglers are with mark.
okay, mark, sweetie, listen to me.
don't go anywhere with those men, do you understand me?
I'll make this brief.
your fiancé in exchange for my diamonds.
I'll call back in 30 minutes with further instructions.
any sign of the police, and mark dies.
no, wait. Look-- Hello? Hello?
give me the phone. - No. They said no police.
wait! - Wait there!
they grabbed the fiancé.
I need to track and locate first number on that list. It's Mark Bevin's phone.
that's Treena's number. Also track and locate.
I'm on the court order.
got it. I'll call Esu.
Mary, please let me go.
Treena, they've already shown they're not leaving any witnesses behind.
if you go, they kill you both. - Hey, girls, is there a problem here?
Oh, Dee, I'm so sorry.
baby, what is it?
they have mark. And it's all my fault.
what? Who has mark?
um, a ring of illegal diamond smugglers.
Why?
Treena, do you want to take this one?
to collect the $10 million in raw diamonds they think I stole from them.
well, did you steal them?
sort of. I'm so sorry.
honey, you know you needn't apologize to me for ripping off a few lousy crooks.
I mean, given the opportunity, I'd do the same thing.
unbelievable.
and just what are you doing about getting my son back?
everything we possibly can.
now tell me where the diamonds are.
for heaven sakes, Treena, tell her where the diamonds are.
in my condo in the freezer in a frozen jar of spaghetti sauce.
here. - All right. I'm on my way.
the judge is writing warrants as we speak.
ESU says the track and locate will be up in 20 minutes.
let's hit it.
got everything you need? - Locked and loaded.
Really?
trust me, it's up there... somewhere.
please bring mark back to me. - I will.
you've got to be kidding me.
son of a bitch.
Yeah. - Hey, it's me.
Where's Treena? - Indisposed. What's the problem?
the diamonds aren't here. What do you bet Treena's not there either?
in the wind.
track her cell. She must have pick-pocketed my bag.
already on it.
mark's cell, by the way, turned up at the bar.
they must have dumped it. - Figures.
you think she split with the diamonds?
either that or she's going to get herself killed.
take central over the river.
the signal's about a mile south on cottonwood.
it's the Bevin's stables.
how do I know you won't kill us after I give you the diamonds?
my dear, I'm going to kill you either way.
the only question is whether it's quick and merciful or if I let Edward tear your fiancé apart one joint at a time.
that doesn't sound like much of a choice.
stop wasting time.
in here.
what are you doing?
what the hell are you doing?
just follow my lead.
I thought I was.
Treena, is that you?
who is this?
I'm the maid of honor. Who the hell are you?
zip up, Derek, and come on.
I understand you having a little fun before you tie the proverbial noose, but a three-way?
that's just excessive.
unless you want to make it a five-way. What do you say?
Oh, my gosh! Treena, what is this?
stay where you are. Hurry up.
give Edward the diamonds.
you two, back of the stall with her. - Okay, okay, okay.
but you're making a big mistake, friend.
my daddy owns one of the biggest car dealerships in Albuquerque and he knows people.
you see, Edward, this is why the world hates Americans.
kill them, Edward. - wait, Edward.
I can be a lot of fun on a road trip.
my proclivities run toward the European, if you catch my meaning.
Freeze! U. S. Marshals!
guess what?
you just got your ass kicked by a girl.
need a hand?
not now, unless maybe you wanted to go after the other guy.
despite my athletic prowess and my eagerness to please you,
I cannot outrun an horse.
baby, sugar, are you okay?
I'm so sorry. Can you ever forgive me?
you are like some damn roller coaster ride, you know that?
so what was the deal with that kiss?
what kiss?
in the barn.
I don't know. You kissed me.
Nuh-uh. I smeared lipstick on your face.
you responded like a guy who thought he was about to break himself off some.
with two armed assassins standing 15 feet away, you were all set to throw down with your best friend.
what do you want me to say? I'm a guy. It's what we do.
Oh, my. - How cool is that?
what's up, y'all?
where the hell does he get a lasso?
nice dress.
here they come.
I'm at the airport and I just wanted to tell you, well, uh...
wait. Don't say anything.
and don't get on the plane till I get there.
well, you better hurry.
it's the last flight out and I start tomorrow.
I'm on my way.
Hey, I gotta go. You got everything covered?
I think we can handle it.
all right. Thanks, guys. I'll call you later.
all right-e-O.
Mary, wait.
I'm kind of in a rush. - Okay. I just want to give you this.
you're opting out of the program?
well, nobody wants me dead anymore.
Aw, don't sell yourself short.
well, thank you. - You're welcome. And congratulations.
maybe you should allow yourself the possibility of something greater.
okay.
I suppose it's possible that happily ever after does exist.
that is, if you're courageous enough to stand this close to someone without guile, defenseless, and put up with all the crap that goes with it.
what? Come on!
what the hell am I doing?
Oh, well... doesn't that just blow?
since 1970, the federal witness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhood sall across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is, somebody wants them dead.
west Village Museum of Contemporary Art Six Months Earlier
I can't do this anymore, Jay.
can we do this later, please?
I'm a little under the gun right now.
no, I need to know that you're going to stop.
I need to know that you have stopped.
stopped what, Marci?
what is it that you want me to do now?
stop seeing her! My god, when did you turn into this?
when did you become so needy?
fine, okay. I'll stop.
I mean, I have stopped.
but she is the publicity director for the museum.
our paths are going to cross from time to time.
you get that, right?
you just need to grow up.
you're right.
you... are right.
so what are you doing?
I thought you didn't wanna... know about this.
I changed my mind.
okay, I'm getting these ready to deliver to some overseas investors.
do they belong to the museum?
no. I acquired them from a local private collection.
by "acquire"you mean stole?
Oh, good god, look, just focus on this, okay?
I mean these are worthtwo and a half million, of which our take is 10%.
now, if I do not get these ready, and off to the harbor in the next half hour, some very bad people are gonna do some very bad thing to me.
any more questions, Marci?
uh, no.
that should do it.
Jay Allen, you're under arrest!
WITSEC ID:...
so is there anything about what we just covered you don't understand?
no, I think we've got it.
good. What about you?
pay attention!
Hey, what?
is there anything about what we just covered you don't understand?
no. - good.
well, then, congratulations, you're the first people in the history of witsec without questions.
thank you. Thank you so much.
for saving our lives.
this is gonna be great. I know it.
excuse me, I have to goto the restroom.
so when does Kayget here?
who's Kay, Stan?
probably best if Marci doesn't know.
gotta be kidding me. This schmuck getsto bring his mistress into the program?
apparently, the schmuck's got juice.
part of his deal with doj.
what about Marci's deal?
she orchestrates this whole thing.
she brings him into the program, and this is how they repay her?
Yeah, that's rough, even by doj standards.
actually, this is how I repay her.
shut your hole.
come on. Stan, she thinks she's getting a fresh start with this asshole.
I can't help that.
what am I supposed to do? Smile to her face, while I help him get laid?
not exactly how I would phrase it, but, uh... yes.
Yeah, well, I won'T.
I swear I'll quit my job, before I'm part of any of this.
so is there anythingabout what we just covered that you don't understand?
no? Good, sign here.
it's funny how things like mortgage payments, and a desire to not eat cat food can get between a person and their principles.
damn, I hate principles.
WITSEC ID:...
if there's one thing working in witness protection has taught me, it's that people hate change.
present Day
Oh, we all say we wanna change.
get thinner, quit smoking, learn to speak portuguese...
but we don'T.
for better or worse, our habits define us.
we turn the pages of the same tattered script over and over, clinging to our well-rehearsed routines like barnacles.
let's see, we'll have youon your feet in no time.
good as new. - Right.
and nothing rankles us more than having to learn new lines.
listen to me, this is just a minor set back.
lots of people tear acl'S.
I know. Listen...
I know this is a huge imposition, and I really appreciate you... you know.
it's not an imposition.
why would you even say that?
anyway... it will just be for a couple of days until the swelling goes down.
then I'll go back to my place.
Ralph- - it's okay.
it's like you said, this is as far as we go.
please, don't throw that in my face, okay?
what's going on between you and me and what's going onwith your knee, they're two separate issues, and I can only deal with one at a time.
I'm sorry. I don't want to argue.
we're not arguing. Jeez...
I'm sorry, Raph. I do wanna take care of you, really.
and the rest, I just-- - what?
can we please just deal with this for now?
sure. - Good.
I gotta get to this work thing.
what the hell are you doing here? - Oh, crap.
I was invited. Which is more than you can say.
Oh, where am I supposed to watch tv?
this was a mistake. I should go.
lie down. You're not going anywhere.
brandy, Raph's welcome to stay as long as he wants.
so why can't he stay in your room?
because.
because I don't have to explain myself to you in my own house.
you know that, those first few months you were like the gluethat kept us together.
just call me Elmer.
Hey, girls. How 'bout a smile?
Ah, more beautiful than Munch's Madonna.
and you're not exactly foie gras.
okay, I'm not kissing you anymore.
gross, gross.
who knows where that mouth has been.
I do. - Hm, do you?
all better.
on that note, I'd better go check our guests.
make sure they're well lubricated.
don't wander off.
don't you just want to eat her up?
today I consider myself the luckiest man alive.
what are you on?
I'm stone cold sober.
I'm healthier, happier, and wiser than I've ever been before.
which is why I need your help. - Here we go.
knew there had to be an angle. - No, there's no angle.
this is strictly straight up.
Mary, I stand before you a changed man.
at least, I want to bea better man for Marci.
she's so good, and giving.
she just deserves so much better than what she's gotten back from me.
okay... go pee in this glass.
I wanna make thingsright with her, Mar.
but I cannot do that with you-know-who around.
you wanna break up with Kay. - Yes.
well, actually I'd like you to break up with Kay for me.
and however you choose to handle it, is fine with me.
just so long as you get her the hell out of Albuquerque.
and don't think I don't appreciate it.
Casper, Bill! Come here.
would you excuse us, please?
listen to me, you crazy bastard.
as much as I would love to stop deceiving Marci, sticking Kay on the next plane out of here isn't that simple.
why not? You brought her here. Now make her go away.
Hey, I didn't bring her here, numbnuts.
I was forced, against every fiber of my being, to comply with your immoral request.
and now I'm requesting that you comply with my moral request and make her disappear.
I don't understand why you're making this so difficult.
there she is!
the woman of the hour.
again with the interruptions.
how are you, sweetie? Mary...
this is my patron saint Margaret Chapman.
Margaret, this is my good friend Mary Shepherd.
nice to meet you. - And you.
you think you're the only one here?
take that outside.
Jay, Jay, Jay. Tell me how you know Margaret.
Margaret is--margaret is responsible for all of this.
uh, these paintings are in her collection.
they've been in her family for over 100 years.
it must be very difficult for you to part with them.
not really. The proceeds go to charity, and besides,
I've always thought of them as rather pedestrian early American crap.
Oh, thank god.
thought I was the only one. - Not hardly.
lovely to meet you, Mary. - And you.
should get some water for that.
Hey, as long as you're going, could you bring me back a beer?
Oh, good god!
clumsy and a wuss, no wonder you couldn't hack it in the pros.
have you ever considered a career in the nursing profession?
I tried, but I couldn'thack the science.
or the drug screen.
but thank you so much for making me feel bad about myself.
tell you one thing, though.
I can sure as hell do a better job than whatever retard wrapped that.
let me see.
maybe another time.
relax, I used to date a guy who got stabbed.
a lot.
enjoying the show?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, tell Jay what happens if he dumps Kay and we move her out of town?
if you break up with Kay, she isn't the only one who gets moved.
you and Marci have to be relocated too.
well, that doesn't seem fair.
it's a reasonable alternative to having the woman scorned give your address to the folks who want you dead.
Yeah.
so, by the way, your program says that the artist painted her works on planks of poplar taken fromthe rail yards.
Yeah, so?
so it should be planks of cottonwood, since that is, in fact, on what they're painted.
I'm quite certain they're painted on poplar.
and I'm absolutely positive they're painted on cottonwood.
thanks for the input, but I think I know my art.
apparently not as well as I know my wood.
don't.
Oh, well, well. This is some party.
Oh, isn't that... - Kay.
Oh, god. We have to get her out of here.
Oh, Jay!
guess my invite got lost in the mail, huh?
is that what happened, Jay? - Kay?
what are you doing here? Jay, why is she here?
Oh, honey, honey.
did he forget to tell you?
see, he moved me here, so we could be together.
no, Marci! No! Marci, Marci, come on. Marci...
liar.
it's okay, baby. I'm here.
get out of here. What's wrong with you?
baby-- - get out!
okay, folks. Show's over. Nothing to see here.
go back to your champagne and mid-19th century folk art.
I'll just... check on her.
Hey, Stan, it's mary.
imagine my surprise when kay swensen showed up drunk at Jay Arnstein's gallery and got into a fist fight with Marci Arnstein.
I mean, who could havepossibly predicted that deceiving a witness by helping her husbandcommit adultery with his tramp mistress would end badly?
you'd have to be a genius to see that one coming, right?
anyway, Stan, I'll need immediatere location authorizations.
call me. Bye.
gotta love the ironic phone message.
did Kay get home all right?
all right being a relative condition, but yes. Pie?
this whole damn mess is my fault.
I should have just said, "sorry, Stan I won't be party to this,"
and accepted the consequences.
it's not like I had a gun to my head.
actually, a gun to your head wouldn't have made you any less culpable.
an immoral decision made under the duress of mortal peril, is still an immoral decision.
understandable, yes.
forgivable, perhaps.
but still, definitely immoral.
I'm just saying.
anyway, they just would have gotten someone else to do it.
eat your pie. Pie makes everything better.
it does help.
house of pie.
Yeah, it is.
when? Where?
is he dead? We're on our way.
somebody shot Jay Arnstein.
and I need you to track down a special agent Frawley out of Manhattan.
Oh, god. Jay...
Jay. Jay, can you hear me?
Jay, it's mary. Can you hear me?
just tell him our boy was shot.
I know what time it is. Just get him on the phone.
who did this, Jay?
who did this to you? Jay!
Hey, end of the road for you.
you keep him isolated, under guard 24/7. Full security detail.
and get the names of all attending mds and nurses. No one else gets near him.
I gotta move Marci.
and... - And Kay. Come on.
they're both in police custody. - Arrested?
not so far, but definitely detained.
at least they're off the street.
anything on the art-smugglers side of this?
waiting to hear backfrom Frawley.
Interpol rates the European connection highly unlikely.
what's left of the smuggling ring is in prison, or under surveillance.
just leaves the American side to worry about.
or Kay... or Marci.
Marci didn't do this.
you don't have to convince me.
but if the albuquerque P. D. Doesn't share your conviction, you got a plan to get them out?
if neither are arrested, I don't need a plan. They're coming with me.
and if they are arrested?
then we cooperate with all local law enforcement agencies, as is our obligation.
I do love when you talk protocol.
watch me work.
what are you, the only cop in albuquerque?
marshals, love the new uniforms.
Yeah, it's the new wave in fashion-forward law enforcement.
Mary, they're keeping me here against my will.
will you tell this moron I have diplomatic immunity?
Kay, sweetie, I'm sure detective Dershowitz has a very good reason for keeping you here.
detective, is my friend Kay under arrest?
no, not so far.
though shooting her has crossed my mind.
either of you want coffee?
I'm good. - I'd absolutely love a cup.
for future reference, diplomats have diplomatic immunity, you're inwitness protection, and have no immunity from anything whatsoever.
can you see the difference there?
why don't you come on back here with me.
mm, thanks. That's great.
Yeah, the sunny disposition act is about to put me in a diabetic coma.
fine. Where's Marci?
I assume one or both of these people belong to you.
belong to me?
are these people protected witnesses?
I can't tell you that.
we're done. - Bobby, wait. Wait.
I'll share everythingI know about the events of this evening with you, but you know I can't talk about you-know-what, so please, don't ask.
all right, fine. What do you know about tonight?
almost nothing. How about you?
good night, inspector.
I'm serious, I was a guest at the opening, like everybody else.
I saw what they saw.
so then, you're not here in any official capacity.
did I say that? - You know what? I don't have time for this.
you go talk to your friend, then you come back and see me.
the other one's in there.
you really made me work for it this time.
I respect that.
what happened?
is Jay dead?
no. He's in surgery.
listen... what happened? Did you shoot Jay?
no, of course not.
when can I see him?
not for a while, until we know who shot him.
the police think I did it. They took my dress for evidence.
you were supposed to be my friend.
you knew about her all along. You brought her here.
Marci, whatever you think about me, I absolutely deserve.
but listen to me, if the police like you for this shooting,
I'm the best friend you've got right now.
so please, tell me what happened, so I can help you.
I was, um...
at the front of the gallery.
and then I-- I heard a shot come from the back office, and I screamed, and I ran back, and Jay was on the floor, and he was covered in blood.
was Jay having any problems with anyone?
maybe, someone at the party?
there was some guy there who was smoking, and I thought under the circumstances, Jay seemed unusually hostile.
I don't know. I don't know who that would be, or...
I'm not involved in the gallery business.
okay.
try to hold on, okay?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Oh, god.
I'm telling you, Bobby. She's incapable.
Really? 'Cause she just found outabout his mistress, she was covered in his blood, and she's got no alibi.
in this business, that's the trifecta.
okay, then, why haven't you arrested her?
because we haven't found a murder weapon and my D. A. Doesn't like circumstantial cases.
then I'm putting her and Kay into protective custody.
you know, technically I don't need the D. A.'S approval to arrest her.
and technically if they're here, I'm here.
every waking minute.
sticking my federally authorized nose into every aspect of your investigation.
is that what you want?
I need to know where they're being kept at all times.
you know I can't do that.
Ah, jesus, you gotta give me something.
how 'bout this?
you issue the arrest warrant, I'll turn her over to you.
and you make both of them available for further questioning.
deal. Deal?
it's a good thing you're hot.
you think I'm hot?
damn, girl. You didn't know?
thank you.
there'll be a security team posted in the parking lotat all times.
no, no, no. See, I have life-threatening allergies.
dust, pollen, smoke, dander, all of which seemto be coating every inch of this room.
God, I can already feelmy throat swelling shut.
here, these are items I will need from my home, if I'm expected to survive these conditions.
hypoallergenic sheets, humidifier, gin...
cigarettes?
I thought you were allergic to smoke.
good point.
smokeless ashtray.
Oh, boy.
okay, thanks.
he's in icu.
the doctor said the next 24 hours will tell.
please, you've gotto take me to him.
I will, as soon as it's safe.
but I need the keys to your houseand the gallery.
Thanks.
I want you to know how bad I feel about this.
how bad I felt the whole time.
Oh, jeez, I am so sorry.
it never occurred to me that helping my husband cheat on me would make you feel bad.
well, I must bea really selfish bitch.
okay. You got my attention.
they're sliding pants.
I'll bet they are.
Chico... what's this?
that's nothing. Put it back. - You, sly dog.
please.
Oh, my god. This is beautiful!
who knew you actually had taste? - Brandi
don't worry, your secret's totally safe with me.
unless, of course, I get my drunk on, then all bets are off.
can you pleaseput it away?
I will, as soon as you tell me when and how you plan on proposing to my sister.
and just a word to the wise, okay, no skywriting, no scoreboards, all right?
and whatever you do, don't put it in her food cause Mary hates that kind of crap.
I already asked her. - You did?
Oh, no.
poor Chico.
when something bad happens to a witness, the first thing every witsec inspector does is look how he or she might have screwed up.
was I somehow responsible?
could I have prevented it?
if it turned out Marci Arnstein shot her husband,
I was pretty sure the answer was staring me in the face.
your work thing run late?
Hey, good morning.
Yes, someone got shot, so I spent the night at the hospital.
listen, I gotta change and head back out, do you need anything?
no, your sister's taking good care of me.
I'm so sorry. I'll talk to her.
no, I'm serious. She's been great.
actually she's very nurturing.
Yeah, look at the job she did wrapping my knee.
Really? Good. I'm glad.
go back to sleep.
it's about time.
I was up all night itching and wheezing.
I hope this fills the void.
what is that supposed to mean?
Hey, don't you get all... enigmatic with me. All right?
you are just a civil servant!
a mail man with a gun!
what void?
the first rule of police work is "when in doubt, review the crime scene."
okay, truth is I have no idea what the first rule of police work is, but if memory serves, it has something to do with keeping your shoes polished to a glossy sheen.
Jesus, Marci. What are you, moon lighting as a janitor?
u. S.Marshall, freeze!
you know you contaminated my crime scene, right?
let me tell you something.
I know how to processa crime scene.
Oh, yeah? Then where are your booties?
Yeah, that's what I thought. You don't even know about booties.
I know about booties.
put these on.
you carry extra booties?
so does your reexaminingthe crime scene about Marci's guilt?
I never made up my mind in the first place. If I did, she'd be in jail.
I'm glad to hear you're at least considering other options.
doesn't mean I won't be stunned if it turned out she didn't do it.
found something?
Yeah, right?
think that's drawn to proportion?
maybe it's one of those perspective things, where the objects in front appear larger than the ones in the back.
Yeah, that's probably it.
I've seen this guy before.
who, mr. Anaconda?
no, him.
he was at the party.
Marci said she didn't know him or anyone else there.
No!
please tell me that you know what key opens that door.
okay, what is taking you so long? Can't you go any faster?
I could, but then I'd miss the fun of watching you lapse into hysteria.
okay, I--I'm nothysterical, okay? I--I'm baking. There's a difference.
dammit! I lost my place.
okay, I'm gonna shoot the lock. Look out.
no, no, no! Don't do that. That only works in the movies.
you're more likely to jam the dead bolt in place.
dammit!
please tell me you didn't lose your place again!
six thousand friggin' keys, and not one of them opens the back door?
good god, woman! What are you doing?
look out out there!
huh, I guess that does work.
just thought I'd let you know.
these are definitely molotov cocktails.
you're very lucky.
thanks for the update, captain.
no problem.
anyway, I thinkwe could assume that the shooting and arson are connected.
that eliminates Marci. She's under24-hour protection.
unless she had an accomplice.
someone who she lied about even knowing.
Oh, Marci. What did you do?
what are you doing to this poor guy?
he's been heretwo days, and you haven't spent two minutes with him.
I've been working.
he understands, and by the way, none of your business.
really, Mary?
does he understand?
where did you get that?
I robbed his house.
it was in his suitcase. Where do you think I got it?
you robbed his suitcase?
no, you nitwit.
I was putting his stuff away.
Yeah, well... don't read too much into it.
and how come you're so concerned with Raphael all of a sudden?
because while you've been running around with god knows who doing who knows what,
I've gotten to know hima little better, and...
and what?
and I've come to see that he's not totally terrible.
I'm happy to hear that.
thanks for helping out, but well... I don't know what I want.
except that I don't want to discuss it with you.
I don't know, you'd better figure it out soon, because someone that great or...
whatever isn't gonna wait around.
lunch!
wait.
what is this?
chicken salad in a baguette with garlic aioli.
you're welcome.
explain the "void"remark.
I think you know.
come in.
don't just draw body parts, people.
find the subject's essence.
find it?
almost tripped over it.
this is a private class.
we'd like a word.
what's he make an hour?
or does he charge by the foot?
stay focused, class.
what can I do for you?
maybe you don't remember.
we met at the opening last night.
you're right. I don't remember you.
where were you two hours ago?
right here, working on a project.
are you sureyou don't remember me?
I was wearing this killer little black number...
I looked hot.
can anyone corroborate that?
Yeah, plenty of people.
I meant his alibi.
no. Why would they need to?
well, because that is when someone torched Arnstein's gallery.
why would I set fire to an art gallery?
I don't know, how do you know Jay Arnstein?
I didn't before last night.
interesting. He seemed to have a strong dislike for you.
any explanation for that?
none whatsoever.
what about Marci Arnstein?
I wouldn't know her if she fell on me.
funny, 'cause she drew this.
Ah, yes... Marci.
not much of an artist.
better at other things.
why did you just say you didn't know her?
a gentleman likes to keep those things to himself.
especially when a married woman's reputation is at stake.
what are these?
these doric, byzantine, something like that?
actually they represent the synthesis of classical Greek and native American.
they're really quite beautiful.
powerful... alive.
Yes.
it's almost human.
Yes. Yes, that's exactlythe point.
Yeah, I can almost feel its pulse.
what kind of wood is this?
cottonwood.
sorry. Dizzy.
would you excuse me? I'm just gonnastep outside, and get some air.
what a magical place this is.
but can't you...
can't you at least allow for the possibility that I'm the one that's supposed to be withJay, not her.
that ours is the true, pure love.
no. Not possible.
our universe seeks order, and I'm afraid in this situation, you represent entropy.
I don't want to represent entropy.
excuse me.
Hey, what's up? I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Hey, how sure are you these paintings were done in cottonwood?
I grew up playing in a stand of cottonwoods.
it's a deciduous wood.
quite strong, but at the same time much lighter than, say, oak.
so if the artist actually did paint on poplar, you would conclude...
the gallery paintings are fakes.
anything else? - No.
that's it for now. Thanks, pointdexter.
rock steady.
that's it. Let it out.
this is tough stuff we're doing.
you're right, you know? You're right.
I should have never stepped in the middle of someone else's marriage.
and with the onset of wisdom, comes transformation.
I should have insisted he get a divorce.
well, I don't think that'S...
quite the direction that we... wanna... look into.
okay. I see, we've... still got somework to do.
what happened, Marci?
the thing with Vidonne...
was a huge mistake.
it was a weak moment at the lowest point in my life.
I find myself in Albuquerque, with no friends, a husband that will barely speak to me...
I just wanted some human contact, some tenderness.
instead, I got Vidonne Guzzone.
and why should I believe you now?
I know you only know the lying, cheating Jay, but when I met him he was the nicest, most interesting, most intelligent man I'd ever met.
and that's the man I thought I was getting back.
shoot Jay?
I'd rather cut off my own legs.
Marci Arnstein, you're under arrest.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against youin a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you.
let's go.
so this is how we see it.
you and Marci were going to rip Jay off, then split with the money.
but then Jay found out, Marci shot him, and you came back later to burn the evidence.
interesting theory.
should I sign it?
it could be worth something some day.
you think it's a joke, huh?
excuse me.
look, that's it, Vidonne, Marci just confessed and sold you out.
is this the part where I'm supposed to break downand tell you everything?
that'd be helpful.
you've been watching too much law & order. - Yeah, he has a point.
what's this? A written confession?
look, we know you forged those paintings, the originals were done on poplar.
the ones in the gallery were on cottonwood, your favorite medium.
please, I wouldn't dirty my brushes forging that pedestrianearly American crap.
what did you just say?
you called the paintings "pedestrian earlyamerican crap."
sorry. Didn't know you were a fan.
can I have a word, please?
how dare you jack my interrogation?
get over yourself. Marci didn't do it. I'm sure of it.
Oh, my god.
listen to me, Bobby.
in order for Vidonneor anyone else to make credible fakes, they would have needed accessto the originals, right?
I guess. - So who gave him access?
Marci. - When?
the paintings onlygot to the gallery days before the opening.
okay, so maybe Jay was in on it too and got greedy at the last minute.
or maybe he found out about the affair and things got ugly.
I don't think so. Jay was turning his life around.
he's not in a frame of mind to pull off a scam like this.
but there is another person who could have commissioned Vidonne to forge those paintings.
Hi, this is Mary Shepherd, Jay's friend. We met at the gallery.
right, hi.
well, I'm sorry to call so late, but I have some amazing news I knew you'd want to hear.
well... they've arrested Jay's wife, Marci, for the shooting.
I know. I know.
Yeah, but wait, here's the best part.
Jay woke up briefly, and asked for you.
well, no, he's sleeping now, but I have to go. You should come by.
the doctors say it'd be good for him.
it's no problem at all. Right, then.
Bye-bye.
lying comes easily to you, doesn't it?
Jay? Jay, can you hear me? Jay.
Oh, jay. I--I...
I just want you to know that...
I feel terrible about this whole mess.
it's just that um...
I can't go to jail.
and, um...
I'm very sorry. I really hope...
that this doesn't hurt.
okay, okay.
uh, help, please! Somebody... something's wrong witJay.
Hi, there. What are you doing?
um, I'm-- uh, something's wrong with Jay. I--it-- he, um...
he started shaking. And--and-- and...
I'm so glad you're here, 'cause you can...
Yeah, I think it was the poison you injected into my I. V.
very photogenic.
I'm really glad you could come.
newton's first law of motion states: "Objects in motion tend to remain in motion."
now drive home safely.
we are all objects in motion, unwavering from our course, until acted upon by external forces.
so how does an upstanding citizen like Margaret Chapman suddenly become a forger, murderer, arsonist?
easy. Her husband diedand all his creditors came calling, so she commissioned vidonne guzzone to copy her art.
the idea being to burn the gallery, collect on the insurance and sell the real paintings to a private overseas collector.
would have worked too, if Johnny cottonwood, here, hadn't tipped Jay off to the forgeries.
good night, Stan.
you know, you really don't have to do this.
when we speak of "cleansing,"it's figurative;
more metaphorical than an actual "soap and water" deal.
Yeah, well.
I tend to take things literally.
and it was that same Marshal, an agent of universal order with uncommon insight into human frailty, that blasted Kate Swanson off her lifelong self-involved path, and out of the witness protection program.
what's that?
all those pictures Jay took.
as for Jay Arnstein, he was an amoral user of people, a heartless cad, a chiseler, a skinflint.
and then, a remarkable thing happened.
Jay Arnstein was hit with the stark, graphic realization that he caused the one true, pure constant in his life, his north star, the thing that allowed him to see the good in himself, to stray from her path.
it was Marci's infidelity that made Jay so determined to change, to be a better man.
and in the strange, twisty way of cause and effect, it was the shared secret Jay and Marci kept from each other of her infidelity, that opened Marci's heart to forgiveness, and allowed them to move on together, to another city, and another second chance.
and for others, it'll take more than a bullet, or infidelity, or financial ruin to affect change.
since 1970, the federalwitness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses some criminals, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is somebody wants them dead.
Boston we've tried, father.
but no matter what we do, we just...
sixteen Months ago don't feel about each other the way we used to.
we kind of...
can't stand each other.
I see this a lot these days.
I think you'll find that looking beyond yourselves.
really can't stand each other.
he's got it, Don.
spending time helping others is the best way I know to open your hearts.
you're familiar with the immaculate heart soup kitchen on third.
Yes, I've heard great things. - We run it.
what about prayer?
we attend mass every day.
we have for years. - Can I finish a sentence?
I don't know. Can you?
maybe there's a more carnal solution.
you could go ayway to recreate your first night of passion.
I was thinking more along the lines of annulment.
well, unless you're first cousins or one of you was previously married, I don't know what grounds-- the Kennedys do it all the time.
for the millionth times, you're not Kennedy.
it just doesn't seem fair.
feel free to take it up with his eminence in rome.
so that's your advice?
sex or prayer?
listen... Don, Ruth...
you're obviously good people and devout catholics.
you need to trust that god has brought you together for a reason, and holds a divine purpose for you as a married couple.
in other words, we're screwed.
like monks before the tudors.
we could, you know-- - don't say it.
divorce.
how can you even suggest such a thing?
especially in god＇s house.
Yeah, I don't know about you, but I'd rather be misrable with you in this life than face eternal damnationin the next.
I suppose you're right.
I mean, this is how we show our devotion to god.
by accepting that we'll always be unhappy together and nothing will ever change.
interfering with my business, father.
you want to save souls?
you go convert some protestants.
but you leave my whores the hell alone! - No, I can't do that!
please, Joseph, think about your immortal soul.
No!
he's with-- - jesus christ!
it's Joseph Connor. - Who's that?
only the biggest racketeer in boston.
come on, let's get out of here.
Albuquerque - Present Day
just a little bit of love.
Amen, Harold. Good job.
Phil, you know the rules. No pill, no breakfast.
take the pill, phil, phil, pill.
good boy. Okay, okay. Now go get breakfast.
Hey, Mary. What'd you bring?
Oh, just, you know, more unclaimed lost and found stuff from the federal building.
Oh, you went out and bought these yourself.
well...
that is so unlike you.
Hey, Mary, good to see you.
Yeah, me too. How are things, Don?
couldn't be better.
uh, Ruth, did you remember to schedule the hospice delivery?
you mean the same delivery I've scheduled every week for over a year?
Yes, that one. - Miss Ruthie, William stole my egg!
sorry, I have to referee.
so you guys still can't stand each other?
Hey, she even finishes your sentences.
that's fun, right?
please explain in god's name why you two don't get divorced.
you make each other miserable.
and please, don't say it's because you're catholic.
lots of catholics get divorced these days. Hell, I'm catholic.
I plan on getting divorced one day.
be a lucky man who divorces you. - Damn straight.
listen, Mary. It doesn't matter how many people get divorced.
it's not a democracy. We don't vote on god's will.
our vows made us one in his eyes.
and who are we to question that?
although I must admit,
I don't understand why he won't let Ruth be with someone that makes her happy.
okay then, too weird for me.
call me if you need anything. - Will do.
thanks for the drop-off.
okay, so don's a little anal, and maybe Ruth's a bit of a ball buster. Who isn't?
still, you gotta wonder, if such good people with so much in common can't find happiness together, what hope is there for the rest of us?
why do they have to come here to eat?
ever since I told Mary about the family discount, I cannot get rid of her.
two weeks ago she didn't want anything to do with Chico.
and then we start hanging out, and all of a sudden she wants to make it work.
leave it alone. - You know what I think?
I think she secretly wants us to get together, that way she's off the hook and it's not her fault.
that's why she keeps asking me to do stuff with him.
I strongly advise you to not put that theory to the test.
so this is nice, right?
it's like our first date all over again.
I hope not.
it took weeks for those bruises to heal.
technically, that was our third date.
only if you count being introduced and running into each other at the grocery stories dates.
Yeah. I have to.
so are limes limes first and then they turn into lemons? Or is it the other way around?
Oh, sweetie.
do you really thinklimes and lemons are the same fruit?
isn't a lemon just a really ripe lime?
honey.
what about cauliflower and broccoli?
what? So I'm not good at produce!
it's not like ever had any growing up.
why don't we forget about the whole thing? I was
no, no, no, please, I want to clear the air.
here you make this sweet, heartfelt gesture and I completely.
well, okay, in fairness to me, your proposal was spectacularly ill-conceived.
I mean, ridiculous, but still.
Hey, what's up?
there's been an accident.
don ferguson's been killed.
I was just talking to him down at the shelter.
seemed like henever left that place.
he was one of the few truly good, selfless people I've ever met.
you know, Any Rand'scentral thesis posited selflessness as antithetical to good.
100 bucks says you die a lonely old man.
Oh, what's he doing here?
what are you doing here?
jogging. - In your car.
I don't like to overdo. What about you?
well, with a fire and a burned body, there's always a question of arson or homicide.
car was registered to a Donald Ferguson.
I take it you knew him.
Yeah, he and his wife run a homeless shelter.
I help out from time to time. What?
nothing, I guess I just don't see you as...
life in service to others kind of person.
but hey, good for you.
so you know of any reason why I should suspect foul play?
your friend, he piss anybody off lately?
I can't imagine. The guy really was a saint.
hmm, if memory serves, a whole bunch of saints were murdered because they go ton the wrong side of the wrong people.
mind if I break the news to his widow? We go back.
knock yourself out.
she's not gonna disappear, is she?
all right, get back to me. Thanks.
it looks like an accident, but we should move Ruth just in case.
sounds good.
the FBI confirmed that Joseph Connor is still in prison awaiting trial.
but his two sons have apparently kept up the family's good name.
I'm waiting for an update on their where abouts from the bureau office in boston.
all right, thanks for checking.
Oh, if you can, start running backgrounds on the people at the shelter.
on their meds they're colorful. Off 'em, who knows?
all over it.
I have to see him.
Ruth, Ruth, it's not a great idea.
he was burned pretty badly.
that doesn't matter. I have to say a prayer over him at least.
he deserves at least that.
all right. All right, I'll--I'll try to make arrangements tomorrow.
he was a good man. I wish.
what?
that we'd never met.
he could've been happy with someone else.
I made him so miserable.
no, that's not true.
you two accomplished so much together.
I know he was happy with that.
look, I know it's the last thing you want to deal with right now, but we have to get you to a safe house.
no, I can't.
the people here will be distraught when they hear the news.
I need to be here for them.
besides, I thought it was just an accident.
Yeah, it probably--it probably was.
but until we rule out other possibilities.
you think Joseph Connorhad something to do with this?
no, I don't.
but we don't take those kind of chances.
sorry, it's not subject to discussion. It's WITSEC policy.
Ruth, we have to leave now.
no, I won't abandon these people. - Ruth
I'll leave the program before I leave the shelter.
and that's not subject to discussion.
besides, these people here, they would never let any one hurt me.
unless it was one of them who killed don.
I just don't understand how you can chase a ball around in circles with a bat and glove all day every day and call that a career. What's the point?
well, first of all, we don't chase in circles.
we run around a diamond. Okay.
but the point is, I guess, that it's...
graceful, and athletic, and pure.
and it doesn't pretend or need to be anything other than what it is.
it's just baseball.
and I'm really good at it.
what?
Oh, nothing. It must be really nice to be good at something.
you're good at things.
no, I'm really not. - No.
I wonder what happened.
can I help you?
Yeah, I was just wondering if I could hang up a flyer.
we don't normally allow people to.
it's for a play that we're doing downtown. A musical.
I love this show!
when I was a young girl, I always dreamt of playing charity.
Oh, well, then you should audition.
audition for what?
uh, yeah. Yeah, right.
what?
I'm too old?
not pretty enough?
no, no, I just think you're too classy to play a prostitute.
Oh, please. You are so trying to get yourself out of trouble.
I am not.
Hey, you are absolutely hot enough to play a hooker.
hell, I'd pay good money to have sex with you.
mom was like this prodigy dancer at age 15 until a bunch of stuff happened.
and my dad was a super gambler.
and Mary, she's always been great at everything.
wait, your dad was the gambler?
no, that's kenny rogers.
my dad was a gambler.
a gambler. - Yeah.
and he pretty much did it professionally.
he won this car in a poker game.
this car?
your dad won this car?
well, yeah, he supposedly won $17, 000, but he was afraid to face jinx because he'd been gone for three days.
so he stopped at the dealership on his way back, and he came home with this little beauty.
actually, I'll show you. My mom kept the original registration.
let's see.
this car is about the only thing in her life she's ever taken care of.
here we go. You see?
so what do you know about lemons?
Limones?
it's--it's my mother.
what the hell is taking so long?
you better not be doing what I think you're doing.
who do you think I am? You?
just get your as back here. Now!
uh, I gotta go. My mom's flipping out about the car.
I'll be back tomorrow to take you to physical therapy.
well, actually, Mary offered to take me.
ha, right! Good luck. All right, call me when she doesn't show.
anyway, I was thinking afterwards we could maybe grab lunch or a movie?
your treat, of course.
well, I already... told Mary I'd go out with her.
and maybe lunch and a movie isn't such a good idea for us.
I don't want to cross the line.
all right, well, I guess I'll see you around then.
Yeah, well... I guess...
good night, then.
Mrs. Ferguson, I'm so very sorry for your loss.
may I see Donald now?
you should know the burns are extensive.
I just wanted to say good-bye.
and, uh... I miss you.
didn't see that one coming, did you?
neither did I.
I'm sorry we couldn't be happy together.
I don't yet know the purpose of our time together.
but I'm sure from where you are the answers are clear.
I hope you know that even though I couldn't understand you, I did...
I do love you.
thank you.
when can I lay him to rest?
I should be able to release the body this afternoon.
I don't know if this'll be of any comfort, but he wouldn't have lived much longer anyway.
I don't understand. - Why?
his liver. It's completely cirrhotic.
he would've been dead within a couple of months.
why was don's liver cirrhotic?
you are aware, mrs. Ferguson, that your husband was an alcoholic.
no, that's not right.
I'm afraid there's no question.
his blood alcohol was 0. 28 at the time of his death.
no, Don never drank. Except for the sacrament.
he helped so many people get sober.
he couldn't stand alcohol. - Alcoholics can be very secretive.
sometimes the people they're closest to don't even know.
my husband got up at 5: 00 every morning to minister to the needy.
he didn't get home until usually well past midnight.
so if you're telling me that that person on that table was an alcoholic, then I'm telling you...
that's not my husband.
then you need to get me a DNA sample, because the body on this table has been a fall-down drunk every day of his adult life.
we got a big problem.
so I don't get it.
someone killed Don and then left a different body in the car to throw us off?
I don't know. Maybe.
could be a kid napping. Any word from the FBI?
Yeah, connor's two sons left boston three days ago on a fishing trip to Mexico.
why didn't the FBI give us a heads up?
well, they're very busy, important people.
Oh, that's unbelievable.
anyway, they still can't locate the connor brothers.
they flew into Sandiego, where they were supposed to meet up with a friend.
but no one in the family can or will confirm or deny anything after that.
seems the brothers are big on witness intimidation, but not so much on itineraries.
but if they killed or took Don to keep him from testifying, why cover it up?
it's more likely to get the trial delayed than thrown out.
who can know the inner workings of the criminal mind?
isn't that kind of our job?
okay, how about this?
maybe the body's one of the brothers.
or another accomplice who got killed accidentally.
or out lived his usefulness.
a lot of maybe in what you just said. - You're right.
why don't we let the FBI worry about tracking the brothers?
we'll concentrate on protecting Ruth and finding Don.
preferably alive.
sounds like a good plan.
I'll head back to the office. - Okay.
Oh, you made it.
of course I made it. Why wouldn't I?
uh, no reason.
Oh, sexy. So something came up at work.
I'm gonna have to just drop you off. You can get a ride home, right?
sure.
in case you didn't notice, I've been trying to be more honest.
well, I don't know. Maybe "open" is a better word.
open with people and myself about how I relate.
which is to say most of the time I don't.
uh, I'll call her back.
Oh, don't not talk to her on my account.
step outside if you need some privacy. - Of course not.
I really want to hear what you're saying.
as I'm discovering, it has a lot do with how I handle or, um, don't handle commitment.
you know your sister. She can talk all day long.
is there something you want to tell me?
I think it's great that you're finally opening up.
I mean about you and Brandi.
get it. For god's sake, talk to her!
Yeah, I'll be quick.
hello.
it's not fair. I schlep you back and forth from therapy.
I do your grocery shopping.
and I wash your gross laundry.
and as soon as I want to do something fun, it's crossing a goddamn line?
listen, Brandi, it's just that last night.
why don't the three of us go and see a movie together sometime?
Oh, please, if we wait for Mary to be available, we'll never go.
and what about last night?
hang on, I'm getting another call.
this is ridiculous. What the hell is going on with you and Raphael?
nothing. - Really?
okay, well, he just took the phone into the next room to talk to you, so something's going on.
nothing, it's just a disagreement.
if you're sleeping with him, I hope you have the decency to tell me.
I'm not sleeping with him!
I can't believe everybody thinks that I would do that.
first mom, and now you. I would never sleep with him.
unless of course you two were definitely broken up.
you know what? I don't have time for this high school B. S.
tell Chico to call me when you two figure this out.
what did you do?
what? Nothing!
why is everything always my fault?
God, go to hell.
Hello? Hello?
now who's gonna drive me?
do you remember anyone walking out this way this morning?
no, not that ,I can recall.
well, someone walked away from the crime scene.
I can't figure out where he went next.
don't worry. I know just who to call.
tracks definitely belong to a male.
approximately six feet,180 pounds.
this guy's totally jerking our chain.
from the trail of blood, he's seriously injured.
you can see by his gaithe's getting weaker.
Yeah, go on, smart ass. Say something else.
Oh, hell no.
car pulled up here.
four-door sedan.
rear right tire's bald.
looks like a guy got out.
there was a struggle.
our guy was pulled into the car.
Where'd they go next?
I-40 road.
with a 15-hour head start, whoever grabbed your guy could be anywhere from California to arkansas.
don's last cell phone call was to the shelter last night at 9: 16.
three and a half minutes.
strange no one mentioned talking to him.
looks like back stage at a fashion show.
only these people look healthier.
Hey, what's going on?
Oh, we're going to the church to pray for the soul of that poor man who died in Don's car.
and for Don's safe return.
uh, I know you're lapsed, but we'd love it if you came.
I'll try to make it. I'm just a little tied up at the moment, what with trying to find your missing husband and all.
listen, Don called the shelter last night around the same time he disappeared, and he spoke to someone for three minutes.
do you have any idea who that might be?
no, but Phil's been missing since last night.
and he wasn't at breakfast this morning.
he never misses breakfast.
he really shouldn't go a day without taking his medication.
you don't think he had-- - what kind of medication is he on?
clozapine. It's an antipsychotic.
I'll get the police on it.
I have to clean up for church.
sorry, I have to take care of this.
Hey, where were you last night?
I was here like always.
did you get any calls? Say around 9: 00?
Nope.
I'm sending a few marshals along for extra security just in case.
have they found those connor boys? - Not yet.
you'll be back right after the service, right?
we're having a picnic after the service.
Ruth, you need to take this seriously.
okay, I know what you're doing is important.
but if I can't protect you...
I really don't want to kick you out of the whole person protection program.
excuse me. I have to get everyone on the bus.
of course you do.
it's tough, huh?
what is?
watching the light go out on those childhood dreams.
so...
what dream did your little light go out on?
Oh, I wanted to play for the Yankees.
stupid.
why is that stupid?
because every boy in the world thinks he's gonna grow up and play for the yankees.
just like every little girl thinks she's going to, uh,
I don't know, star on broad way or some such nonsense.
it's not nonsense.
but you know what the hardest part is?
the dagger to the heart?
no, but I'm sure you'll tell me.
it's when the dream has passed you by, and you've made all these excuses.
you know, why it didn't happen.
and then one day, you have that epiphany.
we just weren't good enough.
we didn't have the goods.
I mean, if we did, well...
we wouldn't be here, would we?
I was good enough.
you gonna write "wash me"on the wind shield?
Hey, Ruth! Do you know whose car this is?
Yeah, it's cook's.
maybe he forgot the ketchup. - Yeah, I'm sure that's it.
real name is Peter·Odell.
multiple drunk and disorderlies, assault, burglary.
Yeah, and that's all in my past.
don and Ruth saved me. I owe them everything. I-I could never hurt Don.
come on, pete.
the dust and the bald tire put your car at the crash sight.
and I know you had a thing for Ruth.
hell, Don knew you had a thing for Ruth.
to tell you the truth, I think she's got a little thing for you too.
come on, it doesn't take a genius to figure your life gets a whole lot better with Don gone.
I swear I didn't do anything wrong.
we've got blood, skin, burnt clothes.
that car is a veritable cornucopia of damning evidence.
things are not looking good for you, my friend.
I didn't hurt Don.
but someone else did?
come on, peter.
new mexico is a death penalty state.
that other body turns out to be Phil, you're on the hook for two murders.
help yourself out.
I can't. I promised not to tell. - Tell what?
that you killed two innocent people?
okay. Okay.
don's car was stolen when he was delivering food to one of the out reach facilities.
he saw the guy steal his car, drive away, then veer off the road.
he ran after him to help, but by the time he got there, the car was totally engulfed.
he got burned and he cut up his leg pretty bad trying to pull the guy out.
calls me at the shelter, tells me to bring the first aid kit, but not to tell anyone.
I drove out there. I picked him up.
he bandaged himself up as best he could, and then he had me, um, drop him off at the free clinic.
he was--he was bleeding a lot.
but I swear he was alive.
don said that he had to disappear.
that everyone had to think that he died in the crash.
he wouldn't tell me why, but he made me promise not to tell a soul.
especially Ruth. He said if She ever found out, that she would be in great jeopardy.
Oh, you expect us to believe that load of crap.
any chance he's connected to the connors?
with that rap sheet, it wouldn't be a total shock.
especially since the FBI still can't find them.
is there any reason why I shouldn't arrest this mope right now?
none that I can think of.
Peter odell, you're under arrest for the murder of Donald Ferguson. Get up.
you have the right to remain silent...
but what you say will be used against you in a court of law.
Hey, Ruth.
I can't understand this anymore! It's too much.
he's dead, he's not dead, he's dead.
I don't know, it's just-- - hey, hey, calm down, calm down.
what's--what's going on?
Phil came to the service. He's alive.
but he's half out of his mind off his meds.
he said don's dead.
he said he saw Don die.
I'm on my way.
Congratulations. Phil's alive, but Don's dead. And you're as good as dead.
Oh, my god. No.
i-it wasn't me. You have to believe me.
no, I really don't.
Yes, I'd like to audition for your show.
okay, I gave him his pill.
but it hasn't taken effect yet.
okay, thanks.
Hey, Phil.
listen, I'll let you get-- I'll let you get back to your praying in a minute, now I need your help.
now, I need you to tell me what happened to Don？
don came to the church.
and--and we prayed.
he was hurt really bad.
did he say who hurt him? So... Don is praying. Then what happened?
then Don died.
I know it's hard.
but I need to know where his body is？ So we can catch whoever hurt him, okay?
don's in heaven. - No, not his spirit. His body.
Where's his body?
don's in heaven.
Phil, okay, when we die...
the body gets buried, and the soul goes to heaven.
the soul inside of Phil. - Right, the soul.
but I want to concentrate-- - Phil has five souls.
they talk all the time. It's really loud.
now they're talking about you.
where is sister constance when you need her?
okay, Phil...
Where's heaven?
in the sky. Okay, good.
souls go to the sky. Bodies stay here.
so where is Don's frickin' body, Phil?
heaven. - Okay.
in the sky with god and Mary and the angels.
Jesus.
St. James and st. Thomas. St. Phillip.
and st. Peter. And st. John.
so Don died.
then he went to heaven. Up there?
is that what you mean?
did you help Don die?
I put Don in heaven. Am I in trouble?
why don't you go pray with miss Ruth, okay?
Phil prays every day.
cook's locked up.
that's well. I think Phil might've killed Don.
keep an eye on him for me.
what else have I got to do?
Oh, god.
what?
I just spent two days running all over creation thinking you were kid napped or dead.
half the hobosin albuquerque are in mourning for you.
cook's facing murder charges. And you have the balls to shush me?
cook killed someone? - Yeah, apparently you.
now start explaining. What is going on?
again with the shushing. - Listen.
come here, come here.
let us pray.
look at her.
she says it's bad manners to look at your feet when talking to god.
six years ago, I was in a deep crisis.
not what people like to calla crisis of faith.
I never doubted god's existence.
I just couldn't find him.
it was like he was avoiding me.
it's a terrible thing to be snubbed by the creator.
so I began attending mass at a different church every day.
seven churches, seven masses, seven days. Sometimes even more.
and on the 17th day, in a small cathedral south of Boston during the liturgy of the eucharist.
I looked over...
and that's what I saw.
I'd never seen anyone with god before.
but you know, that's not enough to sustain a man and a woman.
we've always had god, but never have each other.
you faked your death to get away from Ruth?
no, No, it's god's will, Mary.
he spoke to me through the burning jeep.
he called that poor soul who died in my truck home to end his suffering, and mine, and Ruth's.
how much blood did you lose?
I'm not delusional. God did speak to me.
he said I should hide myself here in his house and pray.
and when my injuries healed, I should leave this place.
ruth will find happiness.
and I'll continue doing his work in another city.
this is god's will, Mary. It's what he wants.
you don't believe.
I believe you believe.
and I can't think of anyone who deserves to be happy in this life more than you and Ruth.
it's ridiculous. Everybody has these suspicious minds.
they automatically assume the worst.
like can't two attractive heterosexual people just be friends?
not in my experience.
Oh, it's Raph.
probably wants me to come over and do his taxes or snake his toilet.
what?
I just have to say a few things, okay?
look, I think that for the good of everybody it's...
probably best if we stop hanging out.
what? That's crazy?
just because we had some stupid moments we can't be friends anymore?
okay, that's ridiculous. Nothing happened. And nothing will happen.
what are you, three?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Chico, cut it out. Chico?
according to the gospel of Don, god told Don to free himself and Ruth from the surly bonds of their loveless marriage.
he said that their union had fulfilled his purpose.
and now Don was to leave Ruth with the belief he had perished so that they might both go out and find happiness on earth.
don, being the lord'sfaithful servant, was loathe to disobey.
and jesus came upon two brothers who were fishing in the sea of Galilee.
and said unto them,"follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people."
what's that got to dowith it?
the FBI just picked up the connor brothers on a fishing boat in the gulf of California with 400 pounds of Mexican heroin in the hold.
before Don limped off into the desert night, he asked god, "lord, you have commanded me to be happy, "but you haven't told me how?"
please, lord, what does it take for two people to be happy?
but the lord had said all that he would say.
since 1970, the federal witness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is, somebody wants them dead.
San Francisco, California. Two Months Ago
I know Mrs. Borzov, it's maddening.
I'm bleeding...
...how...
you think about me when you're having sex with men in prison.
present, day furthermore, your status as a protected witness is contingent on your testifying against your former boss.
impressive, Sergei.
call me serge.
okay, serge.
so you're liking what you see, yes?
you're a real steaming pile.
what this is, a "steaming pile"? - Poop.
doody.
moving on, all contact with friends, family, business associates or any other persons from the witness' past will cease pursuant to signing this agreement.
is okay.
I make new friends.
swell. Do you have any questions?
just one.
what we should name our first baby?
thinks he's got a shot with me.
you have no shot.
in fact, joe stalin's rotting corpse has a better chance of getting into her than you do.
Aw, you can be so sweet sometimes.
her words say nyet, but her eyes say maybe not nyet.
she would use you like a swizzle stick. Sign.
swizzle stick.
come on, biscuit, where are you?
biscuit, you dumb bear, what are you doing in here?
I almost had a heart attack.
Brandi, let's go!
I'm coming!
Aw, crud.
I swear, if you miss your flight...
I know. I know. One of us dies.
you could at least pretend not to be so happy about me leaving.
Yeah, if you'd been ready an hour ago like you were supposed to be, - you'd get to see me pretending. - Fair enough.
mom, we're leaving! Come say good-bye!
she said good-bye two hours ago.
had some thing she had to go to.
what's mom have at 8: 00 in the morning? - Wouldn't tell me.
I swear, she gets squirrelier every day.
sure you don't want to take her with you?
I think everything's gonna be okay for me that is.
Oh, yeah? How come?
I don't know.
I just feel like I'm coming into a really good place.
yeah?
you feel like you're putting out positive energy and the universe is starting to send it back your way?
Yeah, exactly.
mom made you watch the secret with her, didn't she?
she didn't make me do anything. It was her going away gift for me.
Oh, god. It's not a gift. Okay. That's a curse. Especially for you.
Brandi, the universe isn't a genie's lamp.
you can't just rub it and make a wish, and poof, a bag of money appears, or your cancer goes away, or the neighbor's yappy dog gets hit by a car.
it doesn't work that way. There is no magic.
we're not the architects of our own lives. We're monkeys strapped to a rocket, and the only way to exert any influence over its trajectory is by working really, really hard.
Oh, god. Why do I even bother?
you know what, squish, forget I said anything. Go ahead. Wish, ask, receive.
do whatever the hell works for you. I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut.
what? - Nothing.
what? Tell me why you're smiling.
I'm smiling because I just asked the universe to make you stop talking.
thanks for putting me up.
and for the plane ticket. - No problem.
you know I didn't buy it because I wanted to get rid of you, right?
Yeah. Sort of.
cause you don't have to go back to chuck if you don't want to.
he's my boyfriend. - I know.
but I don't want you going back because you think he's your only option.
I know. It's just we've got history.
history's history. You need to think about the future.
Brandi, you deserve to be with someone who makes you happy.
Yeah. You too.
I'm happy... enough.
right.
listen, uh, I know raph screwed up and so does he.
but you have to admit it wasn't completely his fault.
I know.
and he's a really good guy.
and I just don't think that you're gonna do any better than that.
Yeah. You're probably right.
thanks for the advice.
you're welcome. And thanks for the ride.
and for everything. - Sure.
Hey, safe trip, okay? - Okay.
passenger Drop-Off
taxi.
Tasha's so excited for me to meet her new boyfriend. It's really sweet.
Oh, god, I hope we didn't miss him.
I don't know why I'm always late with her.
habitual lateness most often manifests in people with control issues.
Oh, god.
by arriving late for scheduled appointments, you caused the person with whom the appointment was made to wait for you, thereby controlling his or her behavior.
classic passive-aggressive pathology.
when did you ever know me to be passive about anything?
pull over.
I believe your point could've been made without the reckless endangerment.
look.
looks like you got here in time to meet the boyfriend, unless that's how they greet the mailman in kiev.
Jesus, tasha.
relax, prudence.
don't you remember that feeling when the relationship's new and you can't keep your hands off each other?
Yeah, but
contrary to your pseudo-psychoanalysis,
I don't need to be in control all the time.
I think it's great she's out there.
living her life on her own terms. Enjoying herself. For god sakes.
maybe you have a problem with a young woman exploring her sexuality.
but I, for one, am thrilled she found-- - serge.
should've seen that comin'.
you are late. Again.
it was marshall's fault. Sorry.
my boyfriend left.
he has things to do before he goes to work.
I'm sorry. I really wanted to meet him.
where does he work?
gadget town. - Gadget town.
sometimes things just come to me.
anyway, he is electronical genius.
already in only two month, he is associate junior manager.
and are you ready to hear best part?
I think I am.
he's russian. - He is russian.
I am dialed in today.
Yeah, maybe you should hang up.
can you believe I find great russian boyfriend here in albuquerque?
does seem odds-defying.
Tasha, have you told him anything about...
no. I don't tell anyone anything about past.
I follow rules. I swear.
Yeah, okay. We believe you.
so where did you two meet? Shut up.
dating services. Is crazy, I know.
it is kinda. I mean, what do you know about this guy?
and what's with the outfit? Are you working at this place?
Yes. Serge, he help me get job there. I just start last week.
you shouldn't have left the job I got for you, Tasha, without talking to me first.
I hate keeping books.
it's terrible, boring job.
I'm making three times more money working half the hours.
Yeah, I know. It seems fine in the short term.
no. Long term.
I make enough in a week to get 6% money market account.
look at the way they make you dress.
I know. You thinking it just trashy sport bar.
but it major chain.
it listed on nasdaq with over 150 franchise nationwide.
and I get full medical, dental, even 401k with matching contributions.
so you see, thanks to you helping me get new breasts,
I become everything you wish for me to be.
you must be so proud.
we have a serious problem.
coming, coming.
coming, coming. You got Stan.
Hey, Stan, marshall and i need two emergency relocation authorizations.
for who? For who? What happened?
my sweet, innocent russian is dating his con artist russian. That's what happened.
pretty sure the ship has sailed on sweet and innocent, Stan.
Yeah, thanks to his witness.
how did that happen?
we don't know. We're looking into it.
anyway, can you post a security detail to keep an eye on Tasha? While we go rattle serge's cage, see what he's up to?
so they don't know they've been relocated?
no, we wanted to find out what they know before we let them know what we know, you know, just in case they don't know anything.
smart.
all right, I'll post the security detail. Start the paperwork.
great. Thanks. - All right, bye-bye.
and why is it you assume my witness is up to something?
how do you know little daisy d-cup isn't up to something?
because my witness was the unlucky bookkeeper ainsrussian criminals.
your witness is a piece of crap conman who was a russian criminal.
the operative word being "was.
and as you'll soon see, has been working very hard to establish a new life.
Yeah. I know. I know.
he already junior apprentice assistant manager trainee.
of course it's not gonna sound impressive when you say it like that.
hello. - hey, babe. It's me.
Oh, hey, Chuck.
good news. We're on the launch pad and ready to blast off.
okay. Well, what do you want me to do?
you're gonna meet with a guy named russell.
he's spanky's brother.
we're in business with a guy named spanky?
don't laugh. He's gonna make us rich.
and whatever you do, don't make fun of his name.
he's a scary guy.
Oh, great. Well, thanks for hooking me up with him.
I'm really looking forward to getting hacked into little pieces.
relax. Everything's gonna be fine.
all you gotta do is wait for russell to show up.
give him a taste.
if he likes it, which he will, spanky will show up with the cash for the rest.
you give him the suitcase, he gives you the dough.
and we're all set. Cool?
no. Not cool, Chuck. I'm scared.
baby, do you think I'd let you do this if I thought it was dangerous?
I don't know.
of course I wouldn'T. Spanky's a businessman.
you'll be cool, he'll be cool. Now just focus on this.
after today, you're gonna be rich. You're gonna be here.
and we're gonna be together. - Okay.
that's a good girl. It's gonna be fine. You'll see.
Bye.
so what you think of, uh, what I did with place?
it's very- - how'd you afford all this?
that's what I think.
but my girlfriend, she show me how to use my employee discount plus zero percent finance.
then after a year, I sell everything on ebay and actually make profit.
then I do it all over again.
she is a very smart girl.
Really?
Yeah, you should come to store.
I say you're my cousin, uh, get you family discount.
you suggesting he defraud the store?
of course not. Just take advantage.
how'd you meet... your girlfriend?
dating service. Unbelievable, right?
Hey, you should try some time. - Whatever.
and for making matters even better, she's also russian.
well, ukrainian, actually.
but, uh, close enough for politburo work, right?
where are the wires?
it's all running off wireless distribution center in closet.
I install myself.
you want, I do for you. Take, uh, 20 minutes.
I'm very handy.
no, I'm good.
suit yourself. Excuse me. I have to get something from oven.
probably a puppy.
you're just mad because their stories match up perfectly.
just a minute.
you don't suppose... - oh, but I do.
you cook me belinis. - Of course. You do my laundry.
it's, uh, even stevens.
Hey, come, come. I want you to meet my friends.
Hey, where they are?
I don't know. Hello, friends! Where you are?
do you suppose there's any way out of this?
it's not lookin' good.
weird for us to take a shower, right?
for so many reasons.
hello. Is everybody in there?
maybe she'll play it cool, not let on that she knows us.
maybe. Okay. Well, let's go.
Mary, marshall, what you doing here?
so much for cool.
wait, you know them?
Yes. They are my friends.
I meet them on way into town.
that's funny. They're also my friends.
I also meet on my way into town.
here it comes.
you witness.
well, at leastif they're doing this, they're not talking.
thank you, Mary. This is best surprise ever.
I can't tell youwhat relief this is.
no more lying. No hiding.
we can tell everything now.
nobody's telling anybodyanything, okay?
Serge, go sit on the couch.
Tasha, wait for me outside.
Why? What is wrong?
just go. Both of you.
what's funny?
I was just thinking...
Schopenhaue would have loved you.
I gotta call stan.
classic.
Stan here.
Stan, listen, the universe just imploded.
okay, now you're just doing itfor attention.
so which of them compromisedtheir identity first?
well, in a way, neither.
what, they just simultaneouslyblurted out the fact that they'rein witness protection?
actually, we kind ofrevealed it ourselves.
you two compromisedthe identities of federally protectedwitnesses?
not on purpose. - Yeah, it wastotally unintentional.
well, as long as it was a boo-boo.
it's not like the situationcomes up a lot.
look, we just needa ruling.
do they have to berelocated or not?
what? Course they haveto be relocated. He's a felon.
witnesses can't hang outwith felons.
using that logic, she'd haveto be kicked out of the program for violating the termsof the M. O.U.
interesting argument.
so at this point, do eitherof them know anything about the other's past?
not as far as we know. - I'm betting yes.
far as we know? Betting?
not exactly what I'd callprecise analytical terms.
Yeah, yeah, that's-- more compelling arguments. That's great.
all right, why don't you both take your respective witnesses, find out what they know, how they know it, so on, so forth, and maybe we can cometo some semblance of an informed decision. What do you say?
Yeah. Okay.
he ripped off old women.
she dresses immodestly.
chief, yeah, it's stan. How are you?
so here's one I betyou haven't heard before.
two witnesses accidentallystart dating each other.
no. Yeah. There's no punch line. This is actually happening, sir, yeah.
we do nothing wrong. Why we are being separated?
well, even though you didn't intentionally break any rules, we still have a situation that violateswitsec doctrine.
I understand nothing of what you just say.
okay, sorry. I'll start over.
Hey, come here. Sit down. Listen to me.
you have to understand, this is a potentiallyvery dangerous situation, okay?
now think.
did you ever let slipeven the smallest detail about your past?
of course not.
I stick to story. Always.
what about him?
has he asked youabout your past?
Yes.
it suspicious of new boyfriendto ask about past?
of course I don't tell her anything.
you know, first thingI think when we meet is, is this russian girlhere to kill me?
what made you decideshe wasn't?
eh, actually, I decide, she's so beautiful, sweet, sexy, if she came to kill me, it totally worth it.
have to believe me. We did nothing wrong.
I do. I believeyou did nothing wrong.
but you think serge did.
no. I don't know. Maybe. Who knows.
was serge criminal?
Tasha, I can't tell you anything about a witness' past.
please...
Mary, you can't separate us.
if it were just up to me, it wouldn't be a problem.
but witsec has rules. And the rules existto keep you safe.
and how safe I will be when I die of broken heart?
not very safe, I suppose.
just sit hereand try to relax, okay?
nobody's made any decisions about anything yet.
well, sir, I'm just saying I prefer someoneother than myself, someone higher upthe food chain, make this decision.
Yes. Yes. They both still have testimony pending.
uh, no, I don't think I'm playing cover my ass.
all right. Uh, call you back.
you have to separate them, stan. There's no other choice.
well, I'm still... evaluating the evidence.
I'll make my decision when I have all the facts.
what?
in my mind, here's the concern.
let's say one of you decides to break up with the other one.
holy crap, these graphics are amazing.
Tasha's breaking up with me?
did she tell you this?
no, no. I'm just sayingpretend, okay?
so now the other person, the one who got dumped, is very angry.
and if he or she knows about the other one's past, he or she might be tempted to get in touch with people from that person's past to tell them where he or she
that is, the personwho dumped him or her lives.
where? - All right. Let me start over.
okay. Everyone. I made decision.
here it is. I leave program before I leave serge.
you see how--how she love me?
Tasha, think about what you're saying.
I have.
you want my testimony, we stay together.
me too.
well, in that case, I've made my decision.
how can you let them stay together, Stan?
he conned grieving parentsout of their life savings.
do not judge witnesses on their past, Mary.
and now he's conningthe two of you.
why can't you accept thepossibility that he's changed?
check that. Conning the three of you.
I expect it from tasha. She's an innocent.
innocent?
Yeah. Two of youare trained professionals.
the day she got here, the first wordsout of her mouth were...
as far as witsecis concerned, their lives startthe day they enter the program.
when I can get boob job?
I'd hardly call that...
generating File Download Report. Please Wait...
what is that?
you scanned serge's computer?
what the hell do you think you're doing?
my job. Keeping my witness safe.
by violatingmy witness' privacy?
since when is snooping on my witness' boyfriendverboten?
since he's my witness.
totally irrelevant to me.
for all we know, he could be trying to sellher location.
they metat a dating service.
you really think he dated his way through the entire albuquerque singles scene looking for a witnessto expose?
no, but givenhis stellar character, I think this is a crimeof opportunity in the making.
now what?
can I not leave the twoof you alone for one minute?
now why do you suppose someonewith nothing to hide would have everythingon their computer encrypted?
that proves nothing. Lots of people encrypttheir files--I do.
Yeah, because you're paranoid.
Stan, I'm sending this drive to I. T.
and you're not sendingthat drive anywhere. - Yeah, I am.
no, you're not. - Do not touch my computer.
get off of that. Give me that. - Do not touch my...
God, would you just stop it? God!
it's like having a couple 5-year-olds!
just calm down.
Mary, you have no right snooping on his witness.
give him, give him the hard drive. - Stan.
do it now or go home. I'm, I'm sick of this.
what?
you're dead hacker and so is your computer.
great.
you crossed the lineand got what you deserved.
whatever it coststo fix this thing is comin' out of your pocket.
be a bad idea for youto say anything right now.
please don't be Russell.
please don't be Russell.
uh, you must be Russell.
want one?
I'll pass. Thanks.
Why? Afraid of being roofied?
never opened.
no. Just watching my carbs.
you don't have to worry about that.
you're tiny.
I want to put you in my pocket.
I love your hair.
it's so shiny.
how do you get it so shiny?
shampoo.
so when are yougoing to call your guy?
he calls us.
just relax.
we've got some "e" for later.
Rachel gives great massages.
can I--can I useyour bathroom?
of course.
and take some soaps if you want. They always bring more.
classy.
what am I doing here?
okay, Debbie.
I just need a few details. - Okay.
what exactly are you looking for?
gosh. I don't know.
um, I'm really into eastern europeans.
interesting. We don't get many calls for those.
you mean, like, from japan.
no. No. Uh, that would be asia.
uh, romania, poland, hungary...
how about russia?
Yeah. Russia.
I think I have someone for you. - Great.
let me get his profile. - Thanks.
okay.
Hey, this doesn't give email.
I'm sorry. This is for business use only.
Oh, sorry.
um, so you found someone for me?
Yes. His name is serge.
what do you think?
he's cute.
how come he's not already snatched up?
well, I have to be honest, he's something of a player.
in fact, he goes through women like water.
but none of my clients have complained, so he must be doing something right.
sounds fun. Can't wait to meet him.
Mary. Something is wrong?
no, I just wanted to stop by and talk about the whole serge situation.
what situation?
your boss say we can be together.
Yeah, you can. But should you be together?
you've been through a lot, you know?
new country, new identity.
I'm sure you've been really lonely.
but being lonely is not a good reason to make bad choices.
I just don't want you to think serge is your only option.
I don't want to talk about this. I made decision.
I got this from the dating service.
this is when he started seeing you, right?
these are the four women he's gone out with since you.
I don't understand.
the last one was four days ago.
Hey, it's so good to see you again.
you bastard. How you can do this?
what--what--what this is?
it's from dating service.
you cheat on me with these whores.
where you get this? - What difference does it make?
I never want to see you again.
you said you love me.
I do! That was problem.
I love you so much, I could not stand to lie to you about my past.
it was torture to me, you know.
these other girls, they--they are nothing compared to you.
I did not mind not telling them truth.
but now--now everything is okay, huh?
now we tell each other truth.
this is true? - No.
no, no. Of course it's not true, Tasha. He's spewing crap.
Oh, Serge.
I am so sorry I accuse you.
please, can you forgive me?
Oh, my god.
meddling in other people's lives sure takes it out of you.
it really does.
you win by the way.
I'm leaving sergeand Tasha alone.
why is that?
because some people can't be saved, no matter how hard you try.
I don't know.
maybe she just needs to make this mistake to learn and grow or something.
maybe.
I just hope it doesn't get her killed.
why aren't youg loating more?
what's that?
a list of websites.
Gary in I. T.Managed to decrypt enough of the information off of the usb drive to lead us to a secured payment website.
it appears sergeis running some kind of internet business.
unfortunately, they process payments for roughly 4, 000 sites.
you sent the drive to I. T.
I didn't have anything better to do.
I love you like an $8 whore.
I'm sure you mean that in a good way.
want half?
we were just talking about you.
Oh, great.
come in.
we missed you so much.
Yeah. I, I missed you too.
you're early. Spanky won't be here for another hour.
I just wanted to bring over the sample, you know, for spanky to taste.
that is so sweet of you.
you should come with us.
we're going to mexico.
it's gonna be super fun.
we're going to oneof those couples resorts.
Yeah, you should come with.
uh, sure. That sounds awesome.
can I use your bathroom? Mine's broken.
no problem.
mi potty es su potty.
Hey, little baby.
Hey, I brought you something.
this is biscuit.
and he's really special to me.
my sister, mary, gave him to me when I was five to protect me from all the monsters that were under my bed.
and he's really good at his job. So...
if you just take good care of him, he'll take really good care of you, okay?
Bye, biscuit.
I love you.
I gotta go now.
if your parents ever give you any advice...
you should do the opposite, okay?
Why? How? Why?
how about knitting wholesale. Com?
maybe he's trying to lure old women into the lurid world of cross-stitching.

I may be ill.

it wentto voicemail again.
damn it.
why won't she pick up?
do you answer the phone during sex?
depends on what's on tv.
I'm calling your superiors! - Mary, what you are doing?
wait.
that's private property.
shut up. - Why you are doing this?
wait. What is this?
you show us make love?
it's a web cam.
and those other womenon the internet?
it's his business. He makes money showing youhaving sex.
TASHA! Come here. - You filthy, disgusting pig!
let's go, dickweed.
it's all right.
it's all right.
my baby! My baby!
okay, let's go.
how can someone say those things?
I love you.
and make you believe? How is possible?
how can anyone ever trust anyone with their heart?
I don't know.
I wish I did.
come in.
what happens now?
well, after he's booked-- - to me.
I don't care about serge.
you'll be relocated.
you'll have a new name, a new marshal.
you'll start over.
I stare agapeat sunday in the park couples, sidewalk strollers, fingers laced, heads on shoulders, hearts laid bare.

arrogant idiots, I muse, from my spectator view, hoping no one hears the screaming inside my head.
Brandi, when are you gonna grow up and stop making life miserable for everyone around you?
husband of Jinx's father of Mary and Brandi.
spent 30 years on the FBI's most wanted list.
what are these?
letters I've received from daddy over the last 20 years or so.
you didn't misplace the suitcase, did you?
cause that's our whole world.
I'm gonna let you decide who has to pay the price.
your boyfriend or your sister.
I have the drugs. I'll just get them to you.
when was the last time you saw inspector Shannon?
I love you, you're too good for me.
they picked the wrong girl to abduct. I'll bet you anything she broke his nose.
what happened?
I killed someone tonight, mom.
we'll talk about how Brandi's mess lands on you.
more than likely it's a felony indictment.
and juries just love to hang cops.
what the hell is this? - We have a warrant to search the house.
the drugs.
we're done here. All right? It's over.
you think this is over? I'm just getting started.
since 1970, the federal witness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all ross the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is... somebody wants them dead.
girls, go back inside and get your stuff.
all right, climb out of there. You can help me pack.
O. D. Those girls are supposed to be helping out.
and please, you promised you would get rid of this hunk of junk.
fine. I'll throw it out. Here.
it's just a place, O. D. We're all together.
and that's all that matters. - We're all together.
and poor.
hold on.
can I help you? - Yeah. We need two adjoining rooms.
one if that's all you got.
I'm sorry. We're closed.
look, mister, we're not here to cause any trouble.
no, I mean we're closed as in out of business.
I see. Yeah.
look, we just came 2, 000 miles in two days. We just need a place to sleep.
spend the night. Rest up.
come on. Keep the change.
come on. Move up and cover my flank.
I don't even know what that means.
just stay with me.
well, I don't know what to tell you, brother.
both of you shut up for a minute.
spider, I don't like it, man.
we can take it. Dealing weed the rest of your lives.
this is our golden ticket.
this is your ranch, man.
hopefully they don't tear this place down or burn it down or mow it down.
damn idiots.
is this their idea of resting up?
just call 911, damn it.
O. D. Let it go. - Like hell I'm gonna let it go.
this is the only money we got is what the salvage company pays us for the doors and the fixtures.
just call 911.
Hey, you guys really gotta keep it down
stay awake, baby. Stay awake.
it's okay, Lily. It's okay, stay awake. It's gonna be okay.
Oh, my god.
this is interesting. Listen.
paper is a natural host, absorbing myriad spores and other environmental elements throughout its life.
using modern forensic technology, the criminalist can employ these foreign artifacts to trace the origin and subsequent journey of a specific sheet or envelope!
mom, the FBI has been trying to find dad for 30 years.
you really think a greasy piece of paper is gonna lead you to his door?
I'm on to something.
Oh, yes. My name is Brandi Shannon.
please, I have been on hold for, like, 1/2 hour.
my boyfriend Charles Johnson was killed the day before yesterday.
and I was wondering when I might be able to come down and, you know...see the body.
what? No, we're not related. I -- I just said he's my boyfriend.
do you date your relatives, jethro?
Hello? Hello?
you need to work on your people skills.
morning. - Morning.
sweetie, you're up.
are you okay? How are you feeling?
I'm... surprisingly okay.
all things considered, amazing what 30 hours of sleep will do for you.
honey, you're not working today, are you?
no. I'm on administrative leave till I have a psych debriefing.
just so you know, I'm really sorry.
and I'm gonna pay every penny to fix this house once I get a job.
Thanks.
but no one other than that FBI [Bleep] O'Conner is gonna lift a finger to fix this mess.
and mom, you spent enough time with those letters.
I knew you'd obsess over them.
I'm not obsessing.
I just want to hunt down and shoot your deadbeat father.
there's a difference.
seriously, mom. Please don't let this make you crazy... er.
uh, hello?
are you inspector Mann? - Yeah.
Hi, I'm Eleanor Prince, your new office administrator, it is so nice to meet you.
I didn't know we were getting an office administrator.
Oh, well, to tell you the truth, it was a little bit of a surprise to me too.
took the job on the spur of the moment. Totally unlike me.
would you excuse me? I have to have a word with, uh
nice meeting you. - And you.
what's going on, Stan?
her name is Eleanor Prince.
she administered FBI hq in phoenix for eight years.
her husband was a field agent who got killed last year in an auto accident.
you realize Mary's gonna have a problem with this.
Yeah. It crossed my mind.
you have to get her to accept Eleanor.
shall I teach her to levitate while I'm at it?
come on. You know Mary doesn't like new people, or anything else new for that matter.
no, Eleanor's just gonna have to make her bones like everyone else.
Oh, no. - What?
one of Mary's witnesses, Lily Adams, was found dead in her house.
so what happens with Mary on A. L?
you're putting Marshall in charge of an investigation into the death of my witness?
well, uh, yeah.
but I was thinking maybe you could help him out, in a strictly unofficial advisory capacity, of course.
then as soon as you're taken off administrative leave, it's all yours.
so I'll be Marshall's helper.
taking orders from him?
well, I don't know that I'd characterize it as his helper. I
Oh, hell yes.
how did she take it? Mad? Really mad?
fit to be tied furious?
actually, she sounded happy.
that can't be good.
just so you know, this whole arrangement... not my idea.
don't worry about it.
I'm actually looking forward to watching you take charge.
run the show. - Oh, I see.
go ahead, boss me around a little. You know you want to.
excellent. Maybe you'd like to share what you know about the witness.
I'd love to share. She was shot by some biker. Survived, obviously.
ultimately testified against him.
bitch of it was that night or early the next morning, her husband, out of the blue, dropped dead of a heart attack. Young guy too.
Jesus. - I know. Can you imagine?
kids. Every day is a gift, Marshall.
Hi, dershowitz. What brings you?
my own accursed bad luck. - Bobby d, my brother.
what the hell was that?
we bonded over your near - death experience.
and you became black in the process?
honorary. - It's very exciting.
I'll bet. - Here, put these on. I'll take you in.
booties!
the son came home from a camping trip and found her and this.
my dearest children, "I know this comes as a shock to you, " and for that, I'm deeply sorry.
but I have good reason.
as you know, when you were all little, "I went in search of and ultimately found" my own biological family.
what I never told you is that I discovered "my birth father had died of Huntington's disease, " a terrible illness for which there is no cure.
I immediately had you all tested, and by the grace of god, none of you inherited the Huntington's gene.
a few months ago, however, symptoms began to appear.
my doctor confirmed that which I feared.
please don't despair.
I've lived a blessed life, "delightful, really, " and wish to remain in your memories as I am.
be kind to yourselves and each other.
and if it's not too much trouble, "try to look skyward every so often "so that I might see your beautiful faces.
I adore you. I adore you. I adore you. Always and forever, mom.
the Huntington's would explain the laser-printed note and the shaky signature.
ci's haven't determined C. O.D. Yet.
she okay?
I'm not sure.
I don't know if you remember me. I'm Mary shepard from the marshals' service.
Yeah, sure.
I'm really sorry about your mom.
Thanks. - Henry.
I'm so sorry you had to be the one to find her.
I'm Mary shepard from the marshals' service.
Yeah, I remember. I'm angela. This is my sister amy.
Henry, what happened?
it said she was sick, but she seemed okay to me.
when I left, she was so happy.
she was finally going through all those old boxes of stuff from Arkansas.
Oh, my god. Is that dad's radio?
it is.
you told me he got rid of it.
I thought he did. So did mom.
um, if you want to see her, I think it'd probably be okay.
Oh, man. - Yeah.
so unless the ci's can tell me this is something other than what it seems, my plan is to get the basic 411 from the family members and then call it.
you're welcome to observe if you want.
I appreciate the courtesy, detective, but Marshall's the man on this one, not me.
just until she gets off administrative leave.
if you're on A. L. Why are you even here?
I'm his helper. - Who'd you piss off?
Oh, that's funny.
he's a good guy.
you're in a different kind of mood this morning.
actually I'm in a really good mood.
which is kind of weird, considering where I was 48 hours ago.
then I have a witness off herself.
like that's not bad enough, I gotta play second fiddle to a knucklehead like you.
thanks for lumping me in with kidnapping, attempted rape, and suicide.
can't tell you how much that means.
I don't know. Maybe it's the 30-hour sleep, but other than feeling a little raw,
I'm experiencing the opposite of the usual ptsd symptoms you'd expect from somebody who went through what I went through.
what do you make of that?
well, could be a couple of things.
one, this manic mood is in fact a coping mechanism to mitigate a state of extreme cognitive dissonance.
blah blah. Bs. Bs. What else you got?
maybe you're just happy to be alive.
all right, let's go with number two. See how it plays.
good enough.
so I know Stan put you in a tough spot.
making you run my case. Hold my hand so I don't wig out.
I'm sorry about the knucklehead remark. You deserve better than that.
an apology? Really? For that weak-ass smack?
my god, what happened to you in that basement?
Hey, wait up. The ci's made their call. Wasn't suicide. She was murdered.
so is the suicide note fake?
don't know yet. The ci's found impingement in the exhaust pipe of the wood-burning stove.
you see those smear marks?
like from a rag or something.
only there's no rag. Someone plugged the pipe, causing the whole house to fill up with carbon monoxide.
then after Mrs. Adams expired, unplugged the pipe and opened all the windows.
it could've been assisted suicide.
assisting a suicide is still in the books as murder.
enemies?
no. Everyone loved my mom. She...did her ceramics and she helped people.
did she have a life insurance policy?
I don't know about that stuff.
what about a will?
I finally made her do a will last year.
do you know what's in the will?
I have a pretty good idea.
I assume she left the house to Henry.
I told her she should.
Amy has no need for it.
I assumed the house would be sold and split three ways between us.
what about Henry? Doesn't he live there?
the golden raisin.
what does that mean?
growing up, we ate oatmeal just about every day.
eventually, we couldn't stand the sight of it.
so my mother would sprinkle golden raisins on it.
to make it more palatable.
it became our family's version of the silver lining.
how does that apply?
this'll finally force Henry to grow up and get a place of his own.
Henry is a self-professed mama's boy.
he always has been.
when amy and I would get into mischief growing up, we always had to hide it from Henry.
cause he'd tell mom.
Oh, they were so close.
I honestly don't know what he's gonna do.
mom and I just really enjoyed each other's company.
are there any other assets?
uh, she sold her ceramics to a few local vendors.
she was always scraping to make ends meet.
most months I had to supplement.
what about your other siblings? Did they supplement too?
Henry doesn't have two nickels to rub together.
and amy's very sweet.
but she can be funny about money.
money wasn't really an issue. At least we never talked about it.
she was pretty much content with what she had.
and so was I.
are we gonna be here much longer? 'Cause I have to...
I have to get home to my kids.
I'm sorry. Can I get an aspirin and some water, please?
did she give you any indication that she was thinking about taking her life?
she knew I would've stopped her.
Jesus, that's sad.
Yeah, it is. You okay?
Yeah, I think so.
so any thoughts?
Yeah, you're doing a hell of a job.
I'm really enjoying watching you work.
what the hell is with you?
we think it's her own brand of ptsd.
pretty nutty, huh?
unsettling, I'd say.
so do you like any of them for this?
it's hard to find a motive for murder.
I suppose any of them could've assisted.
when I kill my mother, there'll be no doubt as to who did it.
mind if I sit in your chair?
knock yourself out.
I don't know. They've been in the program 17 years.
you ever hear of a witness getting hit 17 years after the fact?
on the other hand, a woman that young, in good health, and by all accounts good spirits, hardly your typical... kevorkian customer.
why is my desk over there?
I thought you were gonna say something.
uh, I forgot to tell you.
we have a new office administrator.
you're gonna love her. - Good job.
what did she do?
I'm sorry, Mary. My plan was to call you.
Oh, and this must be inspector Shannon.
I'm - I'm Eleanor Prince.
nice to meet you. I hear great things.
and I apologize for just barging in, rearranging everything.
I know it was presumptuous.
and I'm sure you and inspector Mann were perfectly happy with the old setup.
but the truth is I didn't wait and ask first because, well you would've said no and then I would have to waste a lot of time and energy trying to convince you, and it would've become this whole big thing.
and really, who needs that, right?
is this a joke?
anyway, if you don't object, here is what I propose.
if you could just give this setup a week.
try it on for size. You know, just see how it feels.
and then if you don't honestly think that this is the better arrangement, well then, we can talk about it. Okay?
okay. - Okay.
okay. Let's do it this way. You handle the threat assessment.
start with the biker that shot her, and I'll jump into leg work.
interview neighbors, friends, liaise with dershowitz.
sounds like a plan.
Oh, we put the three siblings in the middle daughter's house.
it was safe and big enough for all of them. The kids are there. Just made sense.
whoa, whoa, hold on a minute. What are you doing?
you're on administrative leave. You can't be running an investigation.
and what are you doing? You're supposed to be handling all this.
come on, Stan. How long did you think that was gonna last?
Stan, I've got one dead witness and three others who are either suspects or in jeopardy.
I hardly think this is the time to get fussy over bureaucratic bs. Come on.
well, excuse me, inspector, but what you think or don't think is entirely irrelevant.
and I won't tolerate that tone.
you're on official administrative leave.
which means you have no standing, no authority as U. S. Marshal.
consequently no business in this office.
what? - Stan, chill.
now log off and go home. I'll call you when the I. A. Investigator gets here.
that'll be all.
you know what, I don't need a week. I've thought about it.
and this isn't better.
consider me logged off. - Have you lost your mind?
get back here, inspector. You have work to do.
Hey, don't let that get to you.
that was just stan saving face in front of the new girl in class.
you know he didn't mean it. - It's not Stan.
it started with Stan but it's not. It's
it's something else. Something's-- something's happening.
okay. Well, what do you need? Just tell me what you need. Can you do that?
all right, well, let's just walk. As far as you need. We'll walk it off.
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.
what is it? Try to tell me.
happy feeling's all gone. Something's wrong.
something's definitely wrong. Like, broken.
no, it isn't. After the kind of or deal you went through, happy is wrong.
this is how you're supposed to feel.
your brain's all jumbled up trying to sort things out.
try to roll with it. Let it do what it needs to do.
just let it flow, like a river.
can I get you anything, chief?
no. No, thank you.
sir, you didn't do anything wrong. They--they were both out of line.
ms. Prince, when I came to this office ten years ago,
I had twice as many inspectors handling half as many witnesses, and it was still too much.
which is why I'm so grateful you're here.
and I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but when I want an opinion on matters concerning my inspectors, I'll ask.
okay? - Okay.
you sure I can't get you anything?
uh, yeah. Cup of coffee would be great.
if my mother ever saw how we're living, oh, she'd have a stroke.
Mary. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Why is it so dark in here?
well, we're less tragic in the dark.
second bottle, mom?
for those keeping score.
second bottle's witty, ironic Jinx. You want to be gone by number three.
say no more. And you go to bed.
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, I'm fine.
I know, and you need to remember that.
whatever's happening inside your head needs to happen.
just let it flow. Be the river.
don't be a retard. I can't be the river.
you can be the river.
okay, but not today. Tomorrow I'll be the river.
Atta girl. Call if you need me. - Aye aye.
mom, what's happening here?
you went in my room and got the letters?
I couldn't help it.
how would you feel if you found out he was writing me all these years?
honestly I don't even know how I feel about him writing me all these years.
Hey, mare.
I know that this is a ridiculous favor to ask, especially in light of everything, but, um, is there any way that you could help me get into the morgue to see chuck tonight?
no. - Please.
I need to see him before he gets shipped back to new jersey.
by cannon, I hope.
this is Mary.
okay. Okay, okay, okay. Look, don't wait for me.
have the security detail bring you to the hospital. I'll meet you there.
bp 90 over 50. Pulse 110 and sketchy. Blood-ox 88 and falling.
paraesthesia of the skin and mouth. Shortness of breath.
what happened?
a couple hours ago she had a headache.
and then she said her lips and her fingers were tingling.
and I tried to get her to eat something, but she was having a hard time swallowing.
okay, okay.
okay.
get a cpc, chest x-ray, start a liter of saline and intubate.
you two need to wait outside.
okay, come on. Amy. Amy. - We're right here, ange. Come on.
we need to get a line in her to intubate, excuse me.
we have angela heavily sedated and are moving her into quarantine.
at this point, we can't tell if what she has is bacterial, viral, or environmental.
is she going to die?
I don't know. She's in extreme cardiac distress.
her blood work shows elevated alkaloids.
that could be a cause or a symptom.
I'll keep you posted. - Thank you.
Yeah. You sure about this? Okay, thanks.
that was the M. E.
Lily Adams died from a lethal combination of carbon monoxide and a toxin called aconitine.
what's that? - I don't really know.
the M. E. says it's an alkaloid. Causes numbness, cardiac and respiratory failure.
and it's not something that people are exposed to accidentally.
she was poisoned.
I was just about to call you.
Lily Adams was poisoned. Something called aconitine.
they're testing angela for it as we speak.
I'll see your poison and raise you one suspect.
the biker who shot Lily served ten years, got out, and immediately moved to Albuquerque.
the hits just keep on coming.
can I help you? - Yeah.
what's that smell?
sage. We just finished up a little family smudging ceremony.
nice.
and we're U. S. Marshals.
mind if we ask you a few questions?
come on in. - Thanks.
coming, moonbeam? - Yeah.
sorry about the sea songs.
my little boy can't fall asleep without migrating whales.
you know Lily Adams?
of course.
she was found dead this morning.
you know anything about that?
Oh, no. How?
for the time being, it's probably best if you let us ask the questions.
Ah, man. She'll be missed.
seems like an odd sentiment for the woman who sent you to prison.
Lily didn't send me to prison.
my own stupid actions did.
Lily changed my life.
how did she change your life?
well, I was two years into a ten-year bit.
raging at the world, angry as hell.
one day they told me I had a visitor.
Lily came to see you in prison?
she told me she wanted me to know that...
she forgave me.
anyway, she turned my life completely around.
I mean, we started writing letters.
she, uh, she spoke at my parole hearing.
she actually helped me get set up here in Albuquerque.
can you account for your whereabouts the last couple of days?
Yes, I was at an intimacy workshop at corona del sol.
you can check my travel receipts if you want.
we'll let you know.
when was the last time you saw her?
I don't know. Couple weeks ago, I guess.
she, uh...
she makes the ceramic bells for the wind chimes that I sell.
they're beautiful.
is there anyone from your former life who could be holding a grudge against the family?
so somebody killed her?
we believe so.
I'll be damned.
she got the gold.
excuse me?
on the night I shot Lily, we had a bag of a couple'a hundred uncirculated St. Gauden's gold coins that we jacked from this guy outside of Seattle.
depending on the year and the mint state, they could be worth anywhere from 4, 000 to 50, 000. Each.
guy was a chemist. He was a genius with psychoactives.
anyway, one night we were all ripped, and he trots out these sealed plastic cases full of gold coins.
said he bought them from a European collection.
said they were cursed.
you have to wonder what kind of genius flashes his gold to a bunch of wasted bikers.
I take it you were not deterred by the legend of the curse.
not hardly.
but two days later, my brother, the one who actually nabbed the coins, he went to bed with a headache...
and woke up dead.
so what makes you think Lily got the gold?
we stashed it at her motel.
couple days after the shooting, one of my guys went back to get it, and it was gone.
so either he took it, or Lily's family took it.
I can't believe you're accusing us of stealing millions of dollars in gold.
or worse, killing our mother for it.
with our sister lying there in a coma.
all right, keep your voices down. No one's accusing you of anything.
just following upon a lead.
well, maybe you should follow one that has something to do with finding who's trying to kill our family.
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, chief.
excuse us for a minute.
I have to get home to my kids.
we'll have a marshal take you in a minute.
before you say anything, I know I shouldn't be here, but they called and I had to come down.
no, no, that's not why I'm here. In fact, after you...left,
I called dc and got an exigent circumstance dispensation so you could work the case.
they just came through with the approval.
if you think you're up to it.
Yeah.
working the case might be the only thing I'm up to.
does that mean I'm not the boss of her anymore?
afraid so. - Thank god.
also, Mary, I think I could've handled things a little better.
no. Don't worry about it. I was out of line.
so we're good? - Yeah.
Oh, man. Must've dozed off.
Yeah, about six hours ago.
Really? Sorry.
some crazy dreams. Like Lewis Carroll crazy.
it's all part of the reboot.
all right, enough with the "let your brain be a peach."
river. - Whatever. I just want me back.
this is Marshall.
I got that out of my P. O. Box this morning.
dear Robert, I hope this letter finds you well.
please don't be alarmed by receiving a letter in the mail from me.
that's just stuff from her to me. Go down a couple paragraphs.
honestly, I never quite believed the story "you told me about the gold you hid at our motel " in Arkansas.
so you can imagine my surprise "finding a bag full of gold coins" hidden in the back of an old radio" that belonged to my husband.
this key goes to a locker at the easy storage on route 47.
inside, I've left a share of the coins for you.
she just goes on to say that she sent similar letters to her kids.
so why call us? Why not just go get your share?
I don't want any part of this.
that stuff has some serious bad juju.
you gotta warn her kids. If you don't, I will.
there it is.
Oh, man. With that kind of money, I could buy Jinx and Brandi houses.
whoa, don't touch it. - Why? You afraid of the curse?
no, that. 100 to 1 it's aconitine.
Lily divvied up the coins. That's how it got in her system.
I need to open all of the lockers rented to Lily Adams.
18, 19, 20. I'll do it.
three kids, three empty lockers.
we need all your security cam footage for the past three days.
I'm almost done downloading the security cam footage.
take a look at this. - What is it?
it's the 4-1-1 on the guy your biker stole the coins from.
christian Jennings, PhD.
born May 1944. Died October '01.
awarded 17 patents for biochemical compounds.
from '81 to '88, he worked for the army's chemical weapons program.
sounds like a guy who might think coating coins with poison to punish would-be thieves was a good idea.
all right, here we go.
that's angela.
and that's angela exposing herself to aconitine.
that's angela taking amy and Henry's share of the gold.
well, that explains why Henry and amy didn't get sick.
Where'd the gold go? Keep scanning.
and that's amy.
she must've slipped out the back of her house, dodged the security detail, and come here.
how'd she get that key?
they weren't poisoning each other for the gold.
the gold was poisoning them.
Henry, it's Mary.
listen carefully, have you or amy handled any of the coins?
how many times do you have to hear it? We don't know anything about any gold.
they're coated with poison, Henry.
that's how it got into angela's system.
and if you or amy touched them, you've been poisoned too.
Amy's not answering.
Oh, god. Amy's at home with her kids. She has the coins.
Amy's at her house with her kids.
Amy! U. S. Marshals! Open up!
Amy! U. S. Marshals!
find the kids. That poison's 100 times more lethal in children.
this is detective robert dershowitz of albuquerque pd, I've got a medical emergency.
where are you?
Ashley. Tyler. - Ambulance is on the way.
ready or not, here I come.
found you!
No! Don't touch that! - No fair! Finders' keepers.
Finders' keepers I know. Did you touch those coins? - No.
did you? Did you touch them? - No.
okay, okay.
I'm gonna get you guys some chocolate coins instead.
our mom doesn't let us have chocolate.
how ironic. Come on, let's get out of here.
come on, kiddo. Come on.
all right, thanks, Eleanor.
it turns out the coins came from a collection stolen by the Nazis in 1939.
the state department says it goes back to the heirs of the original owners.
how's she doing?
doctor said she's gonna be okay.
kids are fine too. Zero exposure.
thank you, god.
I'm so sorry.
when mom's letter came in the mail, I raced over as soon as I read it.
I didn't want her to die. But I was too late.
she left a note in the front entry warning whoever came in about the gas.
so I pulled the rag out of the stove pipe, opened the windows...
and then...
I just sat with her. For a long time.
and that's when you realized that if you took Henry and amy's letters, that they'd never know about the gold. You could take it all.
it wasn't that, was it?
she meant so much to us.
after dad died, she just... did everything.
and I just... wanted us to appreciate that.
her.
before we all lost our minds over a bunch of stupid coins.
I told amy about them when I thought I was dying.
and you wrote the letter that was found with your mother so Henry and amy would know why she did it.
none of us knew about the Huntington'S.
how'd the coins wind up in the radio in the first place?
angela and I took them from the bikers.
we put them there as a prank.
we thought it would be funny when dad saw it.
but then mom got shot before he saw them.
after mom's surgery, dad went back to the motel to finish packing.
that must've been when he found them and packed the radio with the coins inside in the box.
I wish I could've seen her face when she found that note.
what note?
he stuck a note to the radio that said, "here's your golden raisin. Love, O. D."
he wrote that sweet note having no idea he'd been poisoned.
that he'd never get to share the surprise with her.
so are we out of trouble at this point?
I honestly have no idea what to even charge you with.
thank you.
my addled brain tries to connect the dots, wondering how it is we've come to this place.
cold, stark, blue light lodging indifferent to hope, desire, love, lacking all but the most basic amenities.
poor chuck. So many plans.
if I had known how all this is gonna turn out...
I would've killed you myself.
just thought that you should know that.
have a nice trip back to new jersey.
perhaps this stainless steel and formaldehyde rest stop stands as a postmortem reminder.
what?
you look really pretty tonight, mom.
thank you.
a kind of finger-wagging, refrigerated warning hung for all to see.
all done.
let's go.
let's go.
for those inclined to feed the bears, beat the light, traverse thin ice, run with scissors, get-rich quick, here, but for the grace of god goes you.
Brandi, when are you gonna grow up and stop making life miserable for everyone around you?
husband of Jinx's father of Mary and Brandi.
spent 30 years on the FBI's most wanted list.
what are these?
letters I've received from daddy over the last 20 years or so.
you didn't misplace the suitcase, did you?
cause that's our whole world.
I'm gonna let you decide who has to pay the price.
your boyfriend or your sister.
I have the drugs. I'll just get them to you.
when was the last time you saw inspector Shannon?
I love you, you're too good for me.
they picked the wrong girl to abduct. I'll bet you anything she broke his nose.
what happened?
I killed someone tonight, mom.
we'll talk about how Brandi's mess lands on you.
more than likely it's a felony indictment.
and juries just love to hang cops.
what the hell is this? - We have a warrant to search the house.
the drugs.
we're done here. All right? It's over.
you think this is over? I'm just getting started.
since 1970, the federal witness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all ross the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is... somebody wants them dead.
girls, go back inside and get your stuff.
all right, climb out of there. You can help me pack.
O. D. Those girls are supposed to be helping out.
and please, you promised you would get rid of this hunk of junk.
fine. I'll throw it out. Here.
it's just a place, O. D. We're all together.
and that's all that matters. - We're all together.
and poor.
hold on.
can I help you? - Yeah. We need two adjoining rooms.
one if that's all you got.
I'm sorry. We're closed.
look, mister, we're not here to cause any trouble.
no, I mean we're closed as in out of business.
I see. Yeah.
look, we just came 2, 000 miles in two days. We just need a place to sleep.
spend the night. Rest up.
come on. Keep the change.
come on. Move up and cover my flank.
I don't even know what that means.
just stay with me.
well, I don't know what to tell you, brother.
both of you shut up for a minute.
spider, I don't like it, man.
we can take it. Dealing weed the rest of your lives.
this is our golden ticket.
this is your ranch, man.
hopefully they don't tear this place down or burn it down or mow it down.
damn idiots.
is this their idea of resting up?
just call 911, damn it.
O. D. Let it go. - Like hell I'm gonna let it go.
this is the only money we got is what the salvage company pays us for the doors and the fixtures.
just call 911.
Hey, you guys really gotta keep it down
stay awake, baby. Stay awake.
it's okay, Lily. It's okay, stay awake. It's gonna be okay.
Oh, my god.
this is interesting. Listen.
paper is a natural host, absorbing myriad spores and other environmental elements throughout its life.
using modern forensic technology, the criminalist can employ these foreign artifacts to trace the origin and subsequent journey of a specific sheet or envelope!
mom, the FBI has been trying to find dad for 30 years.
you really think a greasy piece of paper is gonna lead you to his door?
I'm on to something.
Oh, yes. My name is Brandi Shannon.
please, I have been on hold for, like, 1/2 hour.
my boyfriend Charles Johnson was killed the day before yesterday.
and I was wondering when I might be able to come down and, you know...see the body.
what? No, we're not related. I -- I just said he's my boyfriend.
do you date your relatives, jethro?
Hello? Hello?
you need to work on your people skills.
morning. - Morning.
sweetie, you're up.
are you okay? How are you feeling?
I'm... surprisingly okay.
all things considered, amazing what 30 hours of sleep will do for you.
honey, you're not working today, are you?
no. I'm on administrative leave till I have a psych debriefing.
just so you know, I'm really sorry.
and I'm gonna pay every penny to fix this house once I get a job.
Thanks.
but no one other than that FBI [Bleep] O'Conner is gonna lift a finger to fix this mess.
and mom, you spent enough time with those letters.
I knew you'd obsess over them.
I'm not obsessing.
I just want to hunt down and shoot your deadbeat father.
there's a difference.
seriously, mom. Please don't let this make you crazy... er.
uh, hello?
are you inspector Mann? - Yeah.
Hi, I'm Eleanor Prince, your new office administrator, it is so nice to meet you.
I didn't know we were getting an office administrator.
Oh, well, to tell you the truth, it was a little bit of a surprise to me too.
took the job on the spur of the moment. Totally unlike me.
would you excuse me? I have to have a word with, uh
nice meeting you. - And you.
what's going on, Stan?
her name is Eleanor Prince.
she administered FBI hq in phoenix for eight years.
her husband was a field agent who got killed last year in an auto accident.
you realize Mary's gonna have a problem with this.
Yeah. It crossed my mind.
you have to get her to accept Eleanor.
shall I teach her to levitate while I'm at it?
come on. You know Mary doesn't like new people, or anything else new for that matter.
no, Eleanor's just gonna have to make her bones like everyone else.
Oh, no. - What?
one of Mary's witnesses, Lily Adams, was found dead in her house.
so what happens with Mary on A. L?
you're putting Marshall in charge of an investigation into the death of my witness?
well, uh, yeah.
but I was thinking maybe you could help him out, in a strictly unofficial advisory capacity, of course.
then as soon as you're taken off administrative leave, it's all yours.
so I'll be Marshall's helper.
taking orders from him?
well, I don't know that I'd characterize it as his helper. I
Oh, hell yes.
how did she take it? Mad? Really mad?
fit to be tied furious?
actually, she sounded happy.
that can't be good.
just so you know, this whole arrangement... not my idea.
don't worry about it.
I'm actually looking forward to watching you take charge.
run the show. - Oh, I see.
go ahead, boss me around a little. You know you want to.
excellent. Maybe you'd like to share what you know about the witness.
I'd love to share. She was shot by some biker. Survived, obviously.
ultimately testified against him.
bitch of it was that night or early the next morning, her husband, out of the blue, dropped dead of a heart attack. Young guy too.
Jesus. - I know. Can you imagine?
kids. Every day is a gift, Marshall.
Hi, dershowitz. What brings you?
my own accursed bad luck. - Bobby d, my brother.
what the hell was that?
we bonded over your near - death experience.
and you became black in the process?
honorary. - It's very exciting.
I'll bet. - Here, put these on. I'll take you in.
booties!
the son came home from a camping trip and found her and this.
my dearest children, "I know this comes as a shock to you, " and for that, I'm deeply sorry.
but I have good reason.
as you know, when you were all little, "I went in search of and ultimately found" my own biological family.
what I never told you is that I discovered "my birth father had died of Huntington's disease, " a terrible illness for which there is no cure.
I immediately had you all tested, and by the grace of god, none of you inherited the Huntington's gene.
a few months ago, however, symptoms began to appear.
my doctor confirmed that which I feared.
please don't despair.
I've lived a blessed life, "delightful, really, " and wish to remain in your memories as I am.
be kind to yourselves and each other.
and if it's not too much trouble, "try to look skyward every so often "so that I might see your beautiful faces.
I adore you. I adore you. I adore you. Always and forever, mom.
the Huntington's would explain the laser-printed note and the shaky signature.
ci's haven't determined C. O.D. Yet.
she okay?
I'm not sure.
I don't know if you remember me. I'm Mary shepard from the marshals' service.
Yeah, sure.
I'm really sorry about your mom.
Thanks. - Henry.
I'm so sorry you had to be the one to find her.
I'm Mary shepard from the marshals' service.
Yeah, I remember. I'm angela. This is my sister amy.
Henry, what happened?
it said she was sick, but she seemed okay to me.
when I left, she was so happy.
she was finally going through all those old boxes of stuff from Arkansas.
Oh, my god. Is that dad's radio?
it is.
you told me he got rid of it.
I thought he did. So did mom.
um, if you want to see her, I think it'd probably be okay.
Oh, man. - Yeah.
so unless the ci's can tell me this is something other than what it seems, my plan is to get the basic 411 from the family members and then call it.
you're welcome to observe if you want.
I appreciate the courtesy, detective, but Marshall's the man on this one, not me.
just until she gets off administrative leave.
if you're on A. L. Why are you even here?
I'm his helper. - Who'd you piss off?
Oh, that's funny.
he's a good guy.
you're in a different kind of mood this morning.
actually I'm in a really good mood.
which is kind of weird, considering where I was 48 hours ago.
then I have a witness off herself.
like that's not bad enough, I gotta play second fiddle to a knucklehead like you.
thanks for lumping me in with kidnapping, attempted rape, and suicide.
can't tell you how much that means.
I don't know. Maybe it's the 30-hour sleep, but other than feeling a little raw,
I'm experiencing the opposite of the usual ptsd symptoms you'd expect from somebody who went through what I went through.
what do you make of that?
well, could be a couple of things.
one, this manic mood is in fact a coping mechanism to mitigate a state of extreme cognitive dissonance.
blah blah. Bs. Bs. What else you got?
maybe you're just happy to be alive.
all right, let's go with number two. See how it plays.
good enough.
so I know Stan put you in a tough spot.
making you run my case. Hold my hand so I don't wig out.
I'm sorry about the knucklehead remark. You deserve better than that.
an apology? Really? For that weak-ass smack?
my god, what happened to you in that basement?
Hey, wait up. The ci's made their call. Wasn't suicide. She was murdered.
so is the suicide note fake?
don't know yet. The ci's found impingement in the exhaust pipe of the wood-burning stove.
you see those smear marks?
like from a rag or something.
only there's no rag. Someone plugged the pipe, causing the whole house to fill up with carbon monoxide.
then after Mrs. Adams expired, unplugged the pipe and opened all the windows.
it could've been assisted suicide.
assisting a suicide is still in the books as murder.
enemies?
no. Everyone loved my mom. She...did her ceramics and she helped people.
did she have a life insurance policy?
I don't know about that stuff.
what about a will?
I finally made her do a will last year.
do you know what's in the will?
I have a pretty good idea.
I assume she left the house to Henry.
I told her she should.
Amy has no need for it.
I assumed the house would be sold and split three ways between us.
what about Henry? Doesn't he live there?
the golden raisin.
what does that mean?
growing up, we ate oatmeal just about every day.
eventually, we couldn't stand the sight of it.
so my mother would sprinkle golden raisins on it.
to make it more palatable.
it became our family's version of the silver lining.
how does that apply?
this'll finally force Henry to grow up and get a place of his own.
Henry is a self-professed mama's boy.
he always has been.
when amy and I would get into mischief growing up, we always had to hide it from Henry.
cause he'd tell mom.
Oh, they were so close.
I honestly don't know what he's gonna do.
mom and I just really enjoyed each other's company.
are there any other assets?
uh, she sold her ceramics to a few local vendors.
she was always scraping to make ends meet.
most months I had to supplement.
what about your other siblings? Did they supplement too?
Henry doesn't have two nickels to rub together.
and amy's very sweet.
but she can be funny about money.
money wasn't really an issue. At least we never talked about it.
she was pretty much content with what she had.
and so was I.
are we gonna be here much longer? 'Cause I have to...
I have to get home to my kids.
I'm sorry. Can I get an aspirin and some water, please?
did she give you any indication that she was thinking about taking her life?
she knew I would've stopped her.
Jesus, that's sad.
Yeah, it is. You okay?
Yeah, I think so.
so any thoughts?
Yeah, you're doing a hell of a job.
I'm really enjoying watching you work.
what the hell is with you?
we think it's her own brand of ptsd.
pretty nutty, huh?
unsettling, I'd say.
so do you like any of them for this?
it's hard to find a motive for murder.
I suppose any of them could've assisted.
when I kill my mother, there'll be no doubt as to who did it.
mind if I sit in your chair?
knock yourself out.
I don't know. They've been in the program 17 years.
you ever hear of a witness getting hit 17 years after the fact?
on the other hand, a woman that young, in good health, and by all accounts good spirits, hardly your typical... kevorkian customer.
why is my desk over there?
I thought you were gonna say something.
uh, I forgot to tell you.
we have a new office administrator.
you're gonna love her. - Good job.
what did she do?
I'm sorry, Mary. My plan was to call you.
Oh, and this must be inspector Shannon.
I'm - I'm Eleanor Prince.
nice to meet you. I hear great things.
and I apologize for just barging in, rearranging everything.
I know it was presumptuous.
and I'm sure you and inspector Mann were perfectly happy with the old setup.
but the truth is I didn't wait and ask first because, well you would've said no and then I would have to waste a lot of time and energy trying to convince you, and it would've become this whole big thing.
and really, who needs that, right?
is this a joke?
anyway, if you don't object, here is what I propose.
if you could just give this setup a week.
try it on for size. You know, just see how it feels.
and then if you don't honestly think that this is the better arrangement, well then, we can talk about it. Okay?
okay. - Okay.
okay. Let's do it this way. You handle the threat assessment.
start with the biker that shot her, and I'll jump into leg work.
interview neighbors, friends, liaise with dershowitz.
sounds like a plan.
Oh, we put the three siblings in the middle daughter's house.
it was safe and big enough for all of them. The kids are there. Just made sense.
whoa, whoa, hold on a minute. What are you doing?
you're on administrative leave. You can't be running an investigation.
and what are you doing? You're supposed to be handling all this.
come on, Stan. How long did you think that was gonna last?
Stan, I've got one dead witness and three others who are either suspects or in jeopardy.
I hardly think this is the time to get fussy over bureaucratic bs. Come on.
well, excuse me, inspector, but what you think or don't think is entirely irrelevant.
and I won't tolerate that tone.
you're on official administrative leave.
which means you have no standing, no authority as U. S. Marshal.
consequently no business in this office.
what? - Stan, chill.
now log off and go home. I'll call you when the I. A. Investigator gets here.
that'll be all.
you know what, I don't need a week. I've thought about it.
and this isn't better.
consider me logged off. - Have you lost your mind?
get back here, inspector. You have work to do.
Hey, don't let that get to you.
that was just stan saving face in front of the new girl in class.
you know he didn't mean it. - It's not Stan.
it started with Stan but it's not. It's
it's something else. Something's-- something's happening.
okay. Well, what do you need? Just tell me what you need. Can you do that?
all right, well, let's just walk. As far as you need. We'll walk it off.
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.
what is it? Try to tell me.
happy feeling's all gone. Something's wrong.
something's definitely wrong. Like, broken.
no, it isn't. After the kind of or deal you went through, happy is wrong.
this is how you're supposed to feel.
your brain's all jumbled up trying to sort things out.
try to roll with it. Let it do what it needs to do.
just let it flow, like a river.
can I get you anything, chief?
no. No, thank you.
sir, you didn't do anything wrong. They--they were both out of line.
ms. Prince, when I came to this office ten years ago,
I had twice as many inspectors handling half as many witnesses, and it was still too much.
which is why I'm so grateful you're here.
and I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but when I want an opinion on matters concerning my inspectors, I'll ask.
okay? - Okay.
you sure I can't get you anything?
uh, yeah. Cup of coffee would be great.
if my mother ever saw how we're living, oh, she'd have a stroke.
Mary. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Why is it so dark in here?
well, we're less tragic in the dark.
second bottle, mom?
for those keeping score.
second bottle's witty, ironic Jinx. You want to be gone by number three.
say no more. And you go to bed.
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, I'm fine.
I know, and you need to remember that.
whatever's happening inside your head needs to happen.
just let it flow. Be the river.
don't be a retard. I can't be the river.
you can be the river.
okay, but not today. Tomorrow I'll be the river.
Atta girl. Call if you need me. - Aye aye.
mom, what's happening here?
you went in my room and got the letters?
I couldn't help it.
how would you feel if you found out he was writing me all these years?
honestly I don't even know how I feel about him writing me all these years.
Hey, mare.
I know that this is a ridiculous favor to ask, especially in light of everything, but, um, is there any way that you could help me get into the morgue to see chuck tonight?
no. - Please.
I need to see him before he gets shipped back to new jersey.
by cannon, I hope.
this is Mary.
okay. Okay, okay, okay. Look, don't wait for me.
have the security detail bring you to the hospital. I'll meet you there.
bp 90 over 50. Pulse 110 and sketchy. Blood-ox 88 and falling.
paraesthesia of the skin and mouth. Shortness of breath.
what happened?
a couple hours ago she had a headache.
and then she said her lips and her fingers were tingling.
and I tried to get her to eat something, but she was having a hard time swallowing.
okay, okay.
okay.
get a cpc, chest x-ray, start a liter of saline and intubate.
you two need to wait outside.
okay, come on. Amy. Amy. - We're right here, ange. Come on.
we need to get a line in her to intubate, excuse me.
we have angela heavily sedated and are moving her into quarantine.
at this point, we can't tell if what she has is bacterial, viral, or environmental.
is she going to die?
I don't know. She's in extreme cardiac distress.
her blood work shows elevated alkaloids.
that could be a cause or a symptom.
I'll keep you posted. - Thank you.
Yeah. You sure about this? Okay, thanks.
that was the M. E.
Lily Adams died from a lethal combination of carbon monoxide and a toxin called aconitine.
what's that? - I don't really know.
the M. E. says it's an alkaloid. Causes numbness, cardiac and respiratory failure.
and it's not something that people are exposed to accidentally.
she was poisoned.
I was just about to call you.
Lily Adams was poisoned. Something called aconitine.
they're testing angela for it as we speak.
I'll see your poison and raise you one suspect.
the biker who shot Lily served ten years, got out, and immediately moved to Albuquerque.
the hits just keep on coming.
can I help you? - Yeah.
what's that smell?
sage. We just finished up a little family smudging ceremony.
nice.
and we're U. S. Marshals.
mind if we ask you a few questions?
come on in. - Thanks.
coming, moonbeam? - Yeah.
sorry about the sea songs.
my little boy can't fall asleep without migrating whales.
you know Lily Adams?
of course.
she was found dead this morning.
you know anything about that?
Oh, no. How?
for the time being, it's probably best if you let us ask the questions.
Ah, man. She'll be missed.
seems like an odd sentiment for the woman who sent you to prison.
Lily didn't send me to prison.
my own stupid actions did.
Lily changed my life.
how did she change your life?
well, I was two years into a ten-year bit.
raging at the world, angry as hell.
one day they told me I had a visitor.
Lily came to see you in prison?
she told me she wanted me to know that...
she forgave me.
anyway, she turned my life completely around.
I mean, we started writing letters.
she, uh, she spoke at my parole hearing.
she actually helped me get set up here in Albuquerque.
can you account for your whereabouts the last couple of days?
Yes, I was at an intimacy workshop at corona del sol.
you can check my travel receipts if you want.
we'll let you know.
when was the last time you saw her?
I don't know. Couple weeks ago, I guess.
she, uh...
she makes the ceramic bells for the wind chimes that I sell.
they're beautiful.
is there anyone from your former life who could be holding a grudge against the family?
so somebody killed her?
we believe so.
I'll be damned.
she got the gold.
excuse me?
on the night I shot Lily, we had a bag of a couple'a hundred uncirculated St. Gauden's gold coins that we jacked from this guy outside of Seattle.
depending on the year and the mint state, they could be worth anywhere from 4, 000 to 50, 000. Each.
guy was a chemist. He was a genius with psychoactives.
anyway, one night we were all ripped, and he trots out these sealed plastic cases full of gold coins.
said he bought them from a European collection.
said they were cursed.
you have to wonder what kind of genius flashes his gold to a bunch of wasted bikers.
I take it you were not deterred by the legend of the curse.
not hardly.
but two days later, my brother, the one who actually nabbed the coins, he went to bed with a headache...
and woke up dead.
so what makes you think Lily got the gold?
we stashed it at her motel.
couple days after the shooting, one of my guys went back to get it, and it was gone.
so either he took it, or Lily's family took it.
I can't believe you're accusing us of stealing millions of dollars in gold.
or worse, killing our mother for it.
with our sister lying there in a coma.
all right, keep your voices down. No one's accusing you of anything.
just following upon a lead.
well, maybe you should follow one that has something to do with finding who's trying to kill our family.
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, chief.
excuse us for a minute.
I have to get home to my kids.
we'll have a marshal take you in a minute.
before you say anything, I know I shouldn't be here, but they called and I had to come down.
no, no, that's not why I'm here. In fact, after you...left,
I called dc and got an exigent circumstance dispensation so you could work the case.
they just came through with the approval.
if you think you're up to it.
Yeah.
working the case might be the only thing I'm up to.
does that mean I'm not the boss of her anymore?
afraid so. - Thank god.
also, Mary, I think I could've handled things a little better.
no. Don't worry about it. I was out of line.
so we're good? - Yeah.
Oh, man. Must've dozed off.
Yeah, about six hours ago.
Really? Sorry.
some crazy dreams. Like Lewis Carroll crazy.
it's all part of the reboot.
all right, enough with the "let your brain be a peach."
river. - Whatever. I just want me back.
this is Marshall.
I got that out of my P. O. Box this morning.
dear Robert, I hope this letter finds you well.
please don't be alarmed by receiving a letter in the mail from me.
that's just stuff from her to me. Go down a couple paragraphs.
honestly, I never quite believed the story "you told me about the gold you hid at our motel " in Arkansas.
so you can imagine my surprise "finding a bag full of gold coins" hidden in the back of an old radio" that belonged to my husband.
this key goes to a locker at the easy storage on route 47.
inside, I've left a share of the coins for you.
she just goes on to say that she sent similar letters to her kids.
so why call us? Why not just go get your share?
I don't want any part of this.
that stuff has some serious bad juju.
you gotta warn her kids. If you don't, I will.
there it is.
Oh, man. With that kind of money, I could buy Jinx and Brandi houses.
whoa, don't touch it. - Why? You afraid of the curse?
no, that. 100 to 1 it's aconitine.
Lily divvied up the coins. That's how it got in her system.
I need to open all of the lockers rented to Lily Adams.
18, 19, 20. I'll do it.
three kids, three empty lockers.
we need all your security cam footage for the past three days.
I'm almost done downloading the security cam footage.
take a look at this. - What is it?
it's the 4-1-1 on the guy your biker stole the coins from.
christian Jennings, PhD.
born May 1944. Died October '01.
awarded 17 patents for biochemical compounds.
from '81 to '88, he worked for the army's chemical weapons program.
sounds like a guy who might think coating coins with poison to punish would-be thieves was a good idea.
all right, here we go.
that's angela.
and that's angela exposing herself to aconitine.
that's angela taking amy and Henry's share of the gold.
well, that explains why Henry and amy didn't get sick.
Where'd the gold go? Keep scanning.
and that's amy.
she must've slipped out the back of her house, dodged the security detail, and come here.
how'd she get that key?
they weren't poisoning each other for the gold.
the gold was poisoning them.
Henry, it's Mary.
listen carefully, have you or amy handled any of the coins?
how many times do you have to hear it? We don't know anything about any gold.
they're coated with poison, Henry.
that's how it got into angela's system.
and if you or amy touched them, you've been poisoned too.
Amy's not answering.
Oh, god. Amy's at home with her kids. She has the coins.
Amy's at her house with her kids.
Amy! U. S. Marshals! Open up!
Amy! U. S. Marshals!
find the kids. That poison's 100 times more lethal in children.
this is detective robert dershowitz of albuquerque pd, I've got a medical emergency.
where are you?
Ashley. Tyler. - Ambulance is on the way.
ready or not, here I come.
found you!
No! Don't touch that! - No fair! Finders' keepers.
Finders' keepers I know. Did you touch those coins? - No.
did you? Did you touch them? - No.
okay, okay.
I'm gonna get you guys some chocolate coins instead.
our mom doesn't let us have chocolate.
how ironic. Come on, let's get out of here.
come on, kiddo. Come on.
all right, thanks, Eleanor.
it turns out the coins came from a collection stolen by the Nazis in 1939.
the state department says it goes back to the heirs of the original owners.
how's she doing?
doctor said she's gonna be okay.
kids are fine too. Zero exposure.
thank you, god.
I'm so sorry.
when mom's letter came in the mail, I raced over as soon as I read it.
I didn't want her to die. But I was too late.
she left a note in the front entry warning whoever came in about the gas.
so I pulled the rag out of the stove pipe, opened the windows...
and then...
I just sat with her. For a long time.
and that's when you realized that if you took Henry and amy's letters, that they'd never know about the gold. You could take it all.
it wasn't that, was it?
she meant so much to us.
after dad died, she just... did everything.
and I just... wanted us to appreciate that.
her.
before we all lost our minds over a bunch of stupid coins.
I told amy about them when I thought I was dying.
and you wrote the letter that was found with your mother so Henry and amy would know why she did it.
none of us knew about the Huntington'S.
how'd the coins wind up in the radio in the first place?
angela and I took them from the bikers.
we put them there as a prank.
we thought it would be funny when dad saw it.
but then mom got shot before he saw them.
after mom's surgery, dad went back to the motel to finish packing.
that must've been when he found them and packed the radio with the coins inside in the box.
I wish I could've seen her face when she found that note.
what note?
he stuck a note to the radio that said, "here's your golden raisin. Love, O. D."
he wrote that sweet note having no idea he'd been poisoned.
that he'd never get to share the surprise with her.
so are we out of trouble at this point?
I honestly have no idea what to even charge you with.
thank you.
my addled brain tries to connect the dots, wondering how it is we've come to this place.
cold, stark, blue light lodging indifferent to hope, desire, love, lacking all but the most basic amenities.
poor chuck. So many plans.
if I had known how all this is gonna turn out...
I would've killed you myself.
just thought that you should know that.
have a nice trip back to new jersey.
perhaps this stainless steel and formaldehyde rest stop stands as a postmortem reminder.
what?
you look really pretty tonight, mom.
thank you.
a kind of finger-wagging, refrigerated warning hung for all to see.
all done.
let's go.
let's go.
for those inclined to feed the bears, beat the light, traverse thin ice, run with scissors, get-rich quick, here, but for the grace of god goes you.
since 1970, the federal witness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses
some criminal, some not
to neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is-- somebody wants them dead.
and I'm always amazed when I see a smoking-hot babe with a guy that looks
well, a lot like you, sir.
I mean, I understand it from your point of view.
you're just trying to upgrade the ol' gene pool.
we're all trying to find the most attractive mate to breed with
it's called natural selection.
Hello, how are you?
bite me.
you see? It is a system that works.
someone's not paying attention
ladies and gentlemen, our host, our owner, and the rudest son-of-a-bitch in the room, mr. Billy Cooper.
Hey, I don't care what you've heard. Billy is not a mobster.
in fact, just the opposite.
his trash collection company keeps our fair city clean.
his cement plant builds roads, bridges, the occasional pair of shoes.
and generous. Just this week instead of paying me in that filthy U. S.Currency, this beautiful man gave me a brand-new vcr right off the back of his very own truck.
sit down. - Yes, boss.
I am Willie Ripp.
if you need a cheap betamax, I'll be at the bar.
you "murdelized" him.
Where's the agent-- the black hook tour? What happened? Did I get it?
Oh, yeah, I blew him off. - What?
he smelled like English leather. You know how I hate that.
besides, their first show is tuesday in detroit.
now, how are you gonna do that and Carson the same night?
and you heart me, sluggo.
Johnny Carson, tuesday night. Second spot.
here's to America's hottest new stand-up.
Oh, whatever I am, it is because of you.
that is awful.
america's hottest new stand-up deserves much better.
now, shh, you wait here.
I know where Cooper keeps the good stuff. - Okay.
I don't know, John, what can I say?
I make people laugh.
Hey, Willie. Great set tonight.
Hey, give me a sec. I'm kind of in the middle of something here, all right? Okay?
too much gun.
Betamax. That was good.
you'll clean up here?
Oh, my god. - Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go!
morning.
you hear that, right? - It's Peter again.
are you gonna eat that? - No, hey.
I save the top for a reason.
why aren't you answering your phone?
I don't know. So we go on one date. Does that mean he owns me?
am I now one of his many possessions?
have you talked to him since the date?
called to say, "thank you"? Anything?
no, I thought maybe just a clean break was the best way to go.
okay, look, I'm the last person in the world who thinks you owe someone sex just 'cause they buy you dinner.
but come on, the guy took you to the governor's ball, for christ's sake.
by your own account, treated you like a princess all night long.
so if you're not gonna break him off some, the least you can do is take his call.
Hi, Peter. Here's Brandi.
so judging by the porcelain veneers, I'm guessing it's not anasazi.
not unless the anasazi use any 9-millimeter soft points.
so Brandi finally dates someone respectable and she wants to dump him?
respectable and rich.
let's not forget rich is the best part.
respectable and rich do not a relationship make.
true. - Nice ass doesn't hurt.
didn't mean to say that out loud, actually.
marshal service.
one moment, please. I'll see if he's in.
uh, for you, chief, a detective dershowitz. A. B.Q. P.D.
I'll just take it here. - Why the hell is he calling you?
maybe because whatever it is is none of your goddamn business.
I suppose that could be it.
morning, detective. What can I do you for?
inspector Mcqueen.
I found something that belongs to you.
first rule, don't contaminate the crime scene.
that's the part inside the yellow tape.
I knew letting you two come was a mistake.
Yeah, like we were going to miss a chance to see you out in the field.
how's it coming?
eh, slowly. This ground is hard as cement.
dug that up a couple of minutes ago.
nice tie.
eh, english. Single piece. Seven fold.
Oh, jeez.
take it you two are acquainted.
real name was Willie Ripp.
my first witness.
do we know where any of your other witnesses are?
maybe they did things differently back then.
all right, enough. He was a comedian.
one of those aggressive types.
pissed people off for a living.
eyewitness in a big boston murder case, bad guy named billy Cooper.
do you remember him going missing?
not really missing.
walked away, as in - - in the wind.
memory serves, it was october '88.
what about this?
guess he must have lifted it off me.
always thought I just lost it.
it was a huge pain in the ass at the time.
I'll bet.
let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.
actually, his file would be nice. Anything you got, send it over.
the sooner the better, okay?
sure, I can do that for you.
all this Cooperation! Me so happy.
glad somebody is.
Hey, what kind of piece did you carry back then?
a sig nine.
now me not so happy.
your first witness.
just don't start, inspector. - I'm not, I'm not. I just......
wish I could have seen you in action 20 years ago.
Yeah, well, trust me - - it wasn't pretty.
okay, folks, this is the witness security memorandum of understanding.
and it, uh, sets up the, uh, agreement.
lays out all the rules and regulations and
and the understanding between you, the witnesses, and us, the, um......
the witness protection program.
is that all clear?
um, yeah. Absolutely. Crystal clear.
the only thing that's clear is that I am supposed to be on Carson tonight.
do you know what that means?
Willie, stop.
inspector Mcqueen is trying to help us.
help us? Help us what?
lose everything I've worked my whole life for? Thank you, pal.
next time I need help flushing my dreams down the toilet, I'll know just who to call.
actually inspector Mcqueen is helping you stay alive.
this isn't living. This is albuquerque.
he doesn't mean that. He's frustrated. - - Yes, I do mean it.
no, no.
sounds like mr. Ripp was a piece of work.
that he was.
why didn't you tell Dershowitz about the girlfriend?
for one, he didn't ask.
for two, we don't offer up information about protected witnesses unless there's a compelling reason to do so.
so what happened to her?
you might as well give it up, stan. She's like a dog with a bone.
okay, fine.
after Willie took off, Gwen opted out. That's it. End of story. We're done.
you just said she was protected. If she opted out, she's not Protected.
I don't talk about my witnesses, past, present, or future, unless there's a damn good reason.
you want to walk or ride?
check this out. I think I just found out why stan's so touchy about the ripp case.
you mean, aside from the fact that his very first witness wound up murdered in the desert?
look, smart-ass. - - I want to see.
Stan lost ripp before he testified.
blew the case. A cardinal witsec sin.
what are you people doing?
nothing, just
find something useful to do or I'll find something for you.
was he funny?
no, he wasn't.
he wasn't funny at all.
Rabson. You ever feel like you got the wrong last name?
I don't feel like a Rabson.
Rabsons are rotund and sweaty.
your name wouldn't happen to be Rabson, would it?
Olivia! Willie's thirsty!
how long has he been doing this? - - I don't know.
he's been going out every night and he wouldn't tell me where, so tonight, I just followed him.
query, wench. Do I look like a Rabson?
no. You look like a dick.
comic wench, Bar nothing.
I'm Willie Rabson. I'll be here all week.
try the veal.
this is not good. - - I know.
Willie, what are you doing?
I thought you understood - - no comedy, no performing.
you called him, you bitch. You sold me out!
easy, Willie, come on. Easy.
aren't you supposed to be protecting me?
Willie, come on.
really, Gwen. You and manly Stanley?
I mean, I understand, he's got that big gun and all.
Willie, pull yourself together, okay?
everybody's trying to keep you alive and you just
don't lecture me. Can't do this. I can't not be who I am.
Oh, and by the way, pal, your hairline is retreating faster than the italian army, and she hates bald guys.
actually, what I hate are whiny, selfish little boys who refuse to grow up.
screw you, Gwen.
Willie. Willie, just wait, will you
no. No, no, no, no, no. Let him go, let him go. - Will you wait a second?
he'll come back. He always does.
he just needs to cool off, and he needs to sober up.
and then he'll come back and he'll be all apologetic. That's his shtick.
okay. So, uh......
let's move you to a new motel, and I'll go track down Willie.
God, he is such a baby.
well, this is a really tough transition for him.
we're taking from him something he loves.
Yeah, like a crack pipe.
don't worry, Gwen. I'll find him.
we'll get him straightened out.
you're a lot nicer to him than he deserves.
Yeah, well, like I said, you know, um......
giving up your dreams......
walking away from something you love - - it's not easy.
how can you don't have a girlfriend?
chief.
what?
where the hell'd you just go?
what are you talking about? Do you need something?
that's Gwen? She was - - Excuse me.
don't shoot. I'm friendly. I brought tuna.
thank you.
do you need anything else?
I didn't need anything in the first place.
come on, Stan. You're acting weird.
look, I know you're not this twisted up over ripp getting killed.
not if he was the asshole you make him out to be.
so tell me what's going on.
it was a bad case to begin with.
me having no idea what I was doing didn't help things any.
was there something going on with you and the girl?
go back to work, inspector.
and close the door on your way out.
all right, then. Good talk.
we're out to lunch. Come back later.
I got it.
Hey, what's up? Find any more of Stan's witnesses?
Nope, nope, nope. Just stopped by to pick up the ripp file, which, uh, your chief said he'd get right over to me but didn't.
Ripp. That is with, uh, two p's, right?
right.
uh, inspectors, have either of you seen the, uh, ripp file?
with two p'S. - - I did not.
Mary, you seen the ripp file?
I believe Stan had it. Pretty sure he sent it over to you.
uh, no, but he was about to.
could I get this copied for the detective?
coming right up, chief.
how's the case coming?
like dry ice. Boston's turning up zilch.
at the time of the killing, Cooper was still in jail awaiting trial.
now, obviously he could have reached out and touched someone, there's just no murder weapon.
ran the 9-millimeter slugs through N. C.I. C.
no hits, nothing.
makes it almost impossible to reach back 20 years.
1988 - - ballistics that old probably aren't even in the system, right?
if there is a match out there, it's probably buried in some evidence locker somewhere.
Yeah, well, if that's the case, then it might as well be buried in the sahara.
no, not necessarily.
detective dershowitz, have you met my new assistant, eleanor prince?
not officially. Pleased to meet you.
and me, detective. Actually, I'm the new office administrator.
Oh, you have my deepest sympathy.
clearly I committed war crimes in a past life.
comedy stylings of dull and duller.
anyway, when you're done riffing, would you mind sending over the ballistics, just for the hell of it?
Eleanor does almost nothing around here.
it would give her a little project.
Yeah, sure. I'll put a rush on it.
so let's make a list of all the crimes in the boston area where a 9-mil was used, and that mentions Cooper or any of his known associates
no, I got it. I got it. I have someone in boston who can do the legwork.
Oh, and while you're up, I could use a cup of coffee.
Yeah, not a chance in hell. - - Didn't think so.
that was our head of forensics.
they found more bones buried underneath ripp.
female, shot with the same 9. Any ideas?
the victim came in with his girlfriend, and you didn't think that gets a mention?
her info's in the file.
sometimes these decisions about what and what not to disclose take a while to process.
inspectors, would you please communicate to your chief that this is now a double homicide investigation with which he is directly connected?
and from this point forward, I expect his full Cooperation.
Dennis, I already told you nothing came up in N. C.I. C.
that's why I called you.
this requires some digging.
Yes, actual physical searching.
well, did I say it would be easy?
wait a second. I got to go.
you don't mind, do you?
Oh, no.
so we had a good time the other night, right?
Yeah, it was fun. - - Good.
because I was starting to wonder when you weren't returning my calls......
I was busy, all right?
I have a life, you know.
I know. Of course.
good, so don't blame me because you're insecure.
Yeah. I got it. Sorry， if I, uh, hit a nerve.
hit a nerve? What's that supposed to mean?
nothing. You just seem irritated.
maybe that's because I don't like being judged. You're not my mother.
and I'm not an alcoholic.
what? Did I forget to rinse out my coffee cup?
please. Coming here isn't easy for me.
but, god help me, you're the only one I could talk to.
all right. Come in. - - Thank you.
Oh, dear lord, I - - I knew you were messy, but this is just
I will be so impressed if you came all this way at 10: 00 just to take a cheap shot.
I mean, that takes some kind of game.
as you may know, I keep a strict accounting of all office supplies to insure against misuse.
didn't know, but I'm not surprised.
being organized is a good thing, mary.
anyway, when I was rectifying the copy machine logs tonight
you're definitely screwing with me.
Mary, there's something wrong with the ripp file. Stan did something.
what?
the original folder I gave him had 14 pages.
but when I copied it for the detective, there were only 13.
so you think Stan removed one of the pages before giving the file to dershowitz?
that is a highly restricted government file.
technically, what Stan did is the same as withholding evidence.
Mary, he could go to prison. - - Let's not jump to conclusions.
there was probably something sensitive to witness in there that he didn't want bobby to see.
Mary, you've seen the way he's been acting. Something is wrong.
I better call marshall.
holy crap, what's that? - - I don't know.
Oh, my god. Is she all right? - - Yep.
define "all right." - - Oh, no.
What'd you guys have for dinner? Roofies?
I had the lamb.
she had two bottles of what I'm guessing was a lovely '98 duckhorn.
I am - - I am really sorry. I - - I tried to rein her in.
that's okay. Better men than you have tried and failed, including myself.
I can stay if you want. - - No.
Thanks, that's okay. I got this.
I guess I'd better go hose out my car.
okay, we need to turn her on her side in case she gets sick again, so......
okay.
okay. - - Okay.
too much.
this never happened. - - Yeah.
well, how far back did you go?
I can't figure out what page he pulled.
Mmm, I know. It all seems to be here.
intake, M. O.U. Location, case history-- same crap we have today.
maybe protocols were different 20 years ago?
no, I said six years. Come on.
Dennis, I need you to do this right.
City-wide, outlying suburbs all the way to worcester if necessary.
no, actually, that's - - that's not a huge favor, dennis.
a--a huge favor would be, oh, turning a blind eye to someone hacking into N. S.A. Files in order to save their sham of a marriage.
right. You say hi to katie for me.
still can't figure out what's missing?
you know, there is another way to go here.
so Stan Mcqueen.
little jack, I used to call him. - - Why is that?
because he's like a jack russell terrier.
pound for pound, probably the toughest man I know.
well, you know, he plays that shy, quiet thing pretty well, but you don't want to be the guy he's looking at when the switch flips.
I didn't even know he had a switch.
so what's this all about? Is Stan okay?
well, we don't know. That's why we're here.
we're looking into an old case of his.
thought maybe you could shed some light.
let me guess.
Willie Ripp and Gwen jones.
Yeah. How'd you know?
it wasn't hard to figure.
most people, during the course of their careers, make their fair share of mistakes.
Stan - - Stan seems to have gotten all of his out of the way on his very first case.
especially since they both wound up buried in the desert.
any thoughts on the subject?
where did they find them? How long had they been in the ground?
north of tramway, west of the 25. About 20 years.
and - - and someone is looking at Stan for this?
because I can tell you right now, Stan Mcqueen
they found his badge in the hole with the bodies.
I don't care what they found.
Stan had nothing to do with this. He didn't kill them.
I can tell you this, though.
Ripp was an accident waiting to happen.
besides violating every witness rule, he was cheating on Gwen from the minute they got into town.
with whom? - - With whomever.
and he wasn't particularly discreet about it.
now, is there anything else I can tell you? - - Yeah.
Stan took a page out of ripp's file before turning it over to the police.
do you have any idea what it might have been?
put it away.
I can tell you exactly what he took out.
good morning, chief. How you feeling today?
Oh, you know. - - Yeah.
better than yesterday, I suppose.
where are my inspectors?
Oh, I couldn't tell you. They haven't, uh, invited me into their little club yet.
that makes two of us.
don't you worry, 'cause you're doing great.
detective.
I'm a senior detective with albuquerque P. D.
did you think I wasn't gonna find this?
I was hoping you wouldn't.
I have extended every possible professional courtesy to you on this deal.
your badge was buried with the vic, you don't tell me about the girlfriend, and now this?
what the hell kind of excuse are you gonna come up with this time?
like I said, I was hoping you wouldn't find it.
God damn it.
what am I supposed to do with that?
what would you do?
can I do anything, chief?
Yeah.
anyone needs me, tell 'em I'll be down at albuquerque P. D.For a while.
let's go.
are you insane?
you beat the crap out of ripp the last night anyone sees him alive?
in front of multiple witnesses, no less?
which, given all the other evidence pointing towards you, is bad enough.
then you compound the problem by trying to bury the police report.
for christ sakes, Stan.
you're a gnat's ass from a major felony charge.
come on, Stan. Please!
not in a million years did I ever think I'd be telling this story.
so......
for a while, things settled down.
near as I could tell, Willie was following the rules, staying away from the comedy, but Willie...
he was still Willie. He was making Gwen miserable.
he was taking all his frustration out on her so - - so - - so she and I - - we...
we had a couple of lunches, just the two of us.
a couple.
maybe it was four or five. I don't know, mary.
but I was the only shoulder she had to cry on.
I tried to convince myself it was all professional.
I was doing my job.
Gwen was just my witness.
the truth of it is......
you have to tell us what happened.
okay.
okay.
so the night of the police report, I get a call.
and it's Gwen, and she's crying.
I'm sorry. I needed to see you.
it's okay, it's okay.
Where's Willie?
I don't know. I don't care, really.
he was drinking a lot, said he needed a Ripp fix, and he blew out.
I didn't even try to stop him.
okay. It's all right. I'll check the clubs.
he'll turn up, okay? - - No.
just stay here with me, please.
Oh, Gwen.
I can't do this, Gwen. - - Yes, you can.
you can. You just have to let yourself.
Gwen, I got to get Willie.
I got to get him. It's my job.
Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez. He did that?
I'm okay.
when you're here, I'm okay.
lock the door behind me.
Stan, please.
you stole her!
Willie, stop it!
you hit her? Huh?
you low-life piece of garbage!
you ever lay a hand on her again, I'll kill you.
break it up.
this isn't over, asshole!
you messed with the wrong person!
I'm a U. S.Marshal. Let me go.
soon as the cops get here, I'll let you go.
and he did. Took down my name.
Gwen's name. Willie'S.
he, of course, was gone.
and the witness only saw the part of the fight where I was punching Ripp, telling him I was gonna kill him, all the good stuff.
is that why you hid the report?
I took the report out of the folder because it mentioned that Ripp had beaten Gwen up.
it gave her motive.
and you didn't want bobby looking at her for the murder.
so you let him think you did it?
pretty noble gesture for a woman you haven't seen in 20 years.
at the time, I didn't know about - - you know, second body.
you still haven't told us anything that's gonna help clear you.
what happened after the fight?
after the fight.
that's good enough.
I have to find Willie.
please, don't go. Stay here with me.
I know you want to. And I want you to.
I told you before, Gwen.
I can't. I can't. I have to do my job.
quit your job.
you want me to quit the only thing I've ever wanted to do?
that sounds like Willie.
you are nothing like him. You're sweet, and you're kind.
and you don't have to act tough because you actually are.
and we could be so happy together. I know we could.
is this job really what you want?
giving fake lives to other people, no life of your own?
please, Stan.
I wouldn't ask if I really thought this would make you happy but I don't think it will.
please. Come away with me.
please.
okay. Okay.
I crossed the line. - - Blew it to smithereens.
I'd have been less surprised if you'd told us you were the shooter.
looking back, I can't even believe that was me.
so obviously, you didn't quit. What happened? You change your mind?
no, actually, I - - I tried to quit but my boss talked me into finishing the job right.
said I needed to bring Willie in, that I wasn't the kind of person to leave a mess behind.
he was right. - - He didn't mention that.
you talked to malone? - - In the flesh.
Oh, mary, what'd you do that for?
because if you go to jail, he becomes my boss and then I have to kill myself.
Thanks. Appreciate that.
not for nothing, but you as an employee aren't exactly a walk on the beach.
I could pretend that doesn't sting.
I take it you didn't find him.
I looked everywhere all night long.
Finally......
I gave up, went back to the motel to get Gwen.
I mean, I don't know where we thought we were gonna go. We were just...
just gonna go.
so why didn't you?
when I got back to the motel, she was gone.
just a "signed dot-dot" card on the bed.
I guess Willie must have doubled back and convinced her to leave with him.
she had a thing for comedians.
makes you wonder what else malone forgot to mention.
I was thinking the same thing.
okay, well, what about this '88 pat mccoy murderin, uh, sudbury?
Yes, I want you to go all the way out to sudbury.
and, dennis, this is as seriousas it gets.
I am calling sudbury to tell them you areon the way so do not even think about weaseling out.
thank you.
no, ma'am, I'm not doing any special favors. He's in custody.
I'm just running downa couple of other leads before officially placing him under arrest.
Yes, ma'am. I understand. Thank you.
you have other leads? - - Not a one.
this place hasn't changed a bit in ten years.
you have the same desks, same pukey paint job.
can I help you with something?
Yeah, uh, detective dershowitz, this is chief inspectormalone, retired.
chief was Stan's boss at the time this all happened.
you can shed some light on this?
Yeah, but it's not gonna make anybody happy. Where's Stan?
he's inthe conference room. You can see him after we talk.
we don't talk unless Stan's present.
you people are difficult, you know that?
chief.
how's it going?
eh, you know.
so I guess they told youabout Ripp and Gwen, right?
they did. Only...
the other body isn't Gwen.
it's not? - - Who is it?
and how do you know?
I know becauseI put her there.
just hang on.
I'm gonna just put this outside for a minute.
I can't hold my liquo rworth a damn anymore.
anyway, the girl in the hole was a cocktail waitress at a place called the comic book.
doesn't exist anymore.
you killed Ripp.
no, but I wish I had.
you got someone that could make a starbucks run?
Willie Ripp called me from a rest stop.
crazy. Screaming.
Stan stole my girl. I'm gonna kill Stan." Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I could tell he was drunk.
so I told himto stay where he was, I was gonna come and pick him up and straighten everything out.
Stan's badge must have fallen out of my pocket while I was digging.
how'd you wind up with my badge?
so you covered up two murders for Gwen?
no, not for her.
I'm sorry. - - Keep going. Please.
well, after Stan gotin the fight with Ripp, uh, he came to me.
he said he was quitting, and he was gonna take off with Gwen and live happily ever after.
what did you do?
you were makinga mistake, Stan.
you were her portin the storm. - - Chief......
what did you do?
well, I gave you that cockamamie pitch about bringing in the witness and finishing the job right.
I bought myself a few hours so I could go to the motel and move her out.
she didn't change her mind? Opt out?
I relocated her.
I don't believe you. She wanted out, chief.
she wanted - - sh - - she wanted me.
well, I told her you were married.
you had a couple of kid sat home, another on the way.
that she'd be destroying a whole family.
it wasn't real, Stan.
you were her rebound, her lifesaver.
I wasn't gonna let you toss away a promising career for that.
that's where I found the badge. Next to the bed.
well - - I told you this wasn't gonna make anybody happy.
the A. D.A. Called and wants to know if your other leads panned out.
tell her no.
chief, you mind standing up for me?
come on, bobby. He didn't do this.
officer hanson, I know I do not have a badge.
you don't understand. - - Exactly.
could you just hold on for a minute?
I am with - - here with inspector mann, inspector shannon - - I'm with her.
please tell meyou got it.
see what happen when you say, "please"? - Ballistics? We got a match?
Yep, traced the gun back to one of billy Cooper's thugs.
you okay?
Yeah. All these years, I thought she just changed her mind.
he was trying to help you, Stan.
he told me to give you this. It's her number.
you must be hungry. Come on. We'll take you for a bite.
Thanks. I'm gonna pack it in.
I appreciate you guys.
I once dated a man who taught quantum physics.
I learned two things that night.
the first being...... if you ask a quantum physicist to explain how gravity works
not what it is, not how it behaves, but how it works
he will first talk himself in circles, then wind up crying, and finally sometime between entree and dessert, call you a bitch and leave.
saltines and gatorade.
I thought maybe your hangover could use a little expert help.
Thanks.
Oh, god, I don't even know what to say.
say, "come in." - - I look like crap.
you look better than I would.
uh, okay, um, do you want something to drink?
I've got gatorade. - - I'd rather just talk.
we only went out twice.
there's no break-up talk necessary.
I didn't come here to break up with you.
I came to ask you out again. 。 - - What?
do you not remember last night?
because I sure don't, and I still know that it wasn't good.
I mean, seriously, dude. Are - - are you that desperate for a date?
no. I just like you.
Why? I lied to you. I got drunk in front of you.
I'm pretty sure thatI ruined your glove box.
because you have a good heart.
and you're smart and funny and I just - - I just think that......
what?
look, before I got sober, my life was a series of self-implosions.
every time I got with in sight of something I really wanted,
I'd throw a landmin ein my own path to make sure I never achieved it.
and I just think that you need someone to help you avoid your own landmines.
to help you believe you deserve some of those things you really want.
Oh, and you think that you're one of those things that I really want, mr. Conceited?
why wouldn't I be?
I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm quite a catch.
so unless you tell me that you truly don't want to see me anymore,
I think we should go out again next weekend.
okay.
but don't try and get me drunk.
the second revelation came as I sat at the bar pondering the cantilevered relationship between bartender's gutand lower extremities.
and this is important, so pay attention.
before the big bang, before time itself, before matter, energy, velocity, there existed a single immeasurable
this is the special force that on the day before there were days obliterated nothing into everything.
it is the unseen strings tying planets to stars.
it's the maddening want we feel from first breath to last light.
Kansas City, Missouri, two days ago.
Richie, pass the pasta.
you talk to the guy? - Oh, yeah.
did you use the Roma tomatoes?
this tastes different. Not Romas-- I don't know what they were.
so what did he say?
he said what he said before.
were they the larger ones? They don't have as much flavor.
they were the same size, maybe a little smaller.
you set him straight, right?
he saw what happened to the last guy.
Yeah. I remember.
everybody knows what happened to that guy.
what?
Mike Pastrano-- that's who you're talking about. We all know who you mean.
I don't know why you have to use this ridiculous code.
you better mind your own damn business, Mia.
there's a table full of people here, Richie. You think we don't got ears?
I got to sit here and pretend I'm an idiot?
I was just asking about the sauce. - They were camparis, the tomatoes.
any more fascinating questions about the food?
let's talk about something else.
so, Robin, is that a new dress?
cause I don't remember it.
you sure make it look nice.
Thanks, Marco.
I'm sorry... If I ruined dinner.
I know you don't really like Marco.
I shouldn't have brought him over.
I just think you can do better.
and I think, you know, you're 20.
he's a good guy, auntie Mia, If you'd give him a chance.
what is that?
gorgeous, right?
he asked me today.
I was gonna tell everyone over dessert.
Mia, is there any more red?
that's the last of it.
I'm gonna run down to wine mart and grab some. Come on.
I got to finish the dishes.
Trish and Robin can do that.
let's get out of here.
get some air.
all right.
look... We're all sympathetic to your little ordeal, The mood swings.
but you don't think you're taking it a little far?
I got my own opinions.
Marco's a guest in our house. He's gonna be family.
Yeah, well, he's gonna fit right in.
Hey, Richie likes him. That's all that counts.
Yeah, that's for sure.
now you're gonna go and bite the hand that feeds you?
I mean, I know you had your troubles, But you are way out of line.
you're right. I'm--I'm sorry.
you've been doing a lot of talking, Not just at dinner.
you shoot your mouth off all over town... How you're sick of this family,
how you'd love it if we'd all just... Blah, blah, blah.
you think I don't hear things?
you think I don't know where this is going?
no, I'm just tired. I'm...
no.
Benny, please!
friendship, it's been said... is God's way of apologizing for your family.
I don't really subscribe to the God part, but if I did...
apologizing for family is the least he could do...
don't flip out, okay? This is just temporary housing.
once we meet with the a. U.S. A. and you tell them what you have,
a deal gets worked out, and his life becomes about making yours happy.
you said something about a phone.
Yeah. I'm number one on the speed dial.
when you need something, I'm your first and only call.
got it? - Got it.
would have put you in a hotel, but you said a kitchen was important, so...
Yeah, no, this'll do.
uh, I'm not gonna be here that long anyway.
uh, look, Mia, Once you come into WITSEC, you stay where we put you.
no, I know. I meant, um...
do we have any kind of, um, confidentiality here, Like a lawyer or a priest?
uh, sure, if it doesn't jeopardize the case.
I'm terminal.
dying.
you're... You're sure?
it's a grade-four brain tumor.
surgeons got what they could, but my time is limited-- Weeks, months maybe.
God.
wow, um... Okay, um, well, this is-- this is awkward.
but first, I'm gonna have to verify the diagnosis.
knock yourself out.
what's second of all?
I don't know.
I mean, is there anything I can do?
do you need anything-- hospital trips or checkups?
I'm way beyond the hospital now.
no, just keep it to yourself, okay? My family-- they don't even know.
I mean, they know about the surgery, but...
why the secret?
I've spent my whole life being that mobster's daughter, Handled, treated with kid gloves.
now I got to be that dying chick?
I'll pass.
it makes me cringe to think people would be walking on eggshells, treating me all nice.
well, yeah.
I think you've come to the right place.
since 1970, the federal witness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses,
some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute,
distinguishing them from the rest Of the general population.
and that is... Somebody wants them dead.
so Albuquerque-- you like it?
I do. I like the air a lot... And the sky.
the sky is amazing, except for the dumb-ass hot-air balloons.
I know. Who does that, right?
but "more importantly," said the Italian girl, "what about the food?"
how do you feel about red and green chili In every other thing you're gonna eat?
you'll end up loving them or hating them, but trust me, you won't be indifferent for long.
I just mean you'll know in a couple seconds If you like them or not.
Yeah, no, I'm a lot more decisive these days.
that was... Sorry.
Oh, shut up.
can I ask you a personal question?
you don't have to answer.
Yay. My favorite kind of personal questions.
I got no more secrets, not from you, anyway. Go.
well, if I were...
if I were dying, I think I'd be on a beach in Maui with margaritas on an I. V. Drip.
your last days are gonna be depositions and courtrooms and psycho family drama.
I mean, why?
why do it?
because I want to make a stand.
I want to-- I want to leave my mark.
if I have only one breath left, I will use it to testify, for Robin.
it's the only thing I want now. It's the only thing I need.
who's Robin?
my niece.
you know, when I see her, God...
it's like looking at myself in an old scrapbook.
I just want to keep her away from the decisions I made, The mistakes.
and if this goes to trial, my testimony will show her what this family is really like.
maybe it'll-- I-I don't know-- Nudge her onto a different path.
what? - Nothing.
it's just-- Just remarkably non-hateful.
it's funny.
I find I don't have a lot of hate left.
one good side effect.
Congratulations. You are no longer dependent on the department of justice.
Thanks, Marshall. - Not at all.
I'm proud when my fledgling witnesses take that next step moving off the mother's milk
a weekly stipend Into the brave new world of self-reliance.
and I wanted to let you know that while the money stops, our connection goes on unabated.
call me anytime.
I will.
place looks nice.
you settling in okay?
I am.
I didn't think going to law school and not becoming a lawyer would make me so happy.
is that a Todd Calvert?
uh, I guess so. I just like the colors.
listen, I hate to rush, But, uh, I have an appointment at 10: 00, so...
Oh, okay. So we'll touch base whenever. You know how to reach me if you need anything.
sure. Thanks so much, Marshall, for everything.
it's so good to see you, sweet pea.
Aw, you too, mom.
so... Listen, um...
I'm sorry that I haven't called or anything.
it's forgotten.
so... How's the new job, the new place?
questions I never thought I'd be asking you at all, never mind in the same sentence.
everything's... God, good.
next week I'm taking some of my students to a tap dancing competition in Phoenix.
and I am gonna shuffle-ball-change the crap out of those other little brats.
not that winning is important.
so, mom, there's something that I have to tell you about my trip.
sounds ominous.
just say it.
you remember Lauren?
dad's other-- - Oh, I remember Lauren.
uh, well, she has a brother.
and that's who I went to visit.
and he's here now in town.
James' son... Is in town?
mom, Scott's been a really huge help to me. That's his name, Scott.
really supportive, so nice.
uh, and he knows a ton about dad.
and I know this must be really freaky for you, So that's why I asked Mary not to say Until I could...
I want to meet him. - Seriously?
murder, prostitution, racketeering, Fencing stolen goods, DVD piracy.
name a crime, someone in the Cusato family is guilty of it.
and you'd be comfortable Testifying against the people who raised you?
comfortable not the word I'd pick, but one of them tried to kill me,
and I'm a hell of a lot less comfortable with that.
which brings us to the gun and the car.
according to forensics, Benny didn't actually get a hold of it...
he was going to kill me if I didn't kill him.
D. A. ruled self-defense.
or didn't you get that memo?
look, I wrote down everything I know.
I'm not exactly sure how all of these names are involved,
but I do know they've all received some kind of payoff From my brother Richie.
county clerks, city officials, A few state politicians-- Customs guys, for sure.
and, uh, what about you?
what should I know about my star witness?
can't think of a thing.
nothing else that might be relevant?
just something you maybe forgot to mention to the FBI.
I realize you were rushed, confused-- a lot going on that day.
seems like there's a lot going on right now.
spit it out, counselor.
you underwent cranial surgery four months ago.
you don't think a brain tumor might warrant a mention?
you promised. - I never said a word.
she didn't have to. We do our own homework.
but why would you make a promise like that, inspector?
intentionally withholding pertinent information From the d. O.J?
she's here. She's telling you what she knows.
she asked for confidentiality in a private matter.
I gave my word. What's the problem?
the problem is, she might not live long enough to make it to trial.
say it again, Tippy, but slap her this time, cause I think it's all a little too much with the niceties.
Mia, I apologize... Really, but we can't pretend this away.
the fact is, it's possible.
it's also possible I could live long enough.
even the doctors don't know for sure.
look, we're all sitting here because there's a case.
that hasn't changed. I'm guessing taped testimony's still admissible?
inspector, when it comes to legal strategy, I prefer not to guess.
I need to look into this further, Assess the ramifications.
we'll meet again tomorrow.
but if there's anything else you're holding back-- - Nope.
dead on arrival's my big, dark secret.
what you want to do with that is up to you, Mr. Boswell.
what's that? - That would be a painting.
Oh, God, no. You're not gonna try to drag me to another art show, are you?
last time I got cornered by some freak wearing a kilt With a tattoo inside his bottom lip That said, "yeah."
he showed it to me twice while I was eating.
no. This is about my witness, Patrick hill.
it might be nothing. We'll see. How's Mia?
levelheaded, funny, smart, no trouble whatsoever.
she's...
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.
your talent for keeping a confidence is one of your most admirable qualities,
along with the ability to shoot accurately While downing a big gulp.
can I help you find something?
Yeah, there was this--there was this witness a while back,
a case where a guy was shot and dying and they videoed his testimony.
u. S. Vs. Carlton Marchak-- first-degree felony kidnapping, Sending you the link.
Oh, praise Jesus, you have no life.
Teresa. You're the best.
I'd say that's about right.
so I went over to Patrick hill's house To hand-deliver his last stipend check.
I know and admire the ritual.
and I noticed something odd-- A watercolor by Todd Calvert.
help me out. I'm more into pottery.
calvert is expensive.
I don't see how Patrick can afford it, not with his income-- rent, student loans.
but he's a law - abiding citizen, witnessed a crime, came forward to testify.
sounds far from shady.
Yes, but this is where it gets disturbing. I went into his financials.
no record of a credit card purchase or personal check clearing for any kind of artwork.
gift? - Possibly.
but in my research, I also accessed his phone records.
281--area code for...- Houston. He called home.
he did. - We got a breach?
we may. The question is why?
Hey, Marshall. - We need to talk.
well, can it wait? I'm--I'm kind of in the middle of something.
it has to be now.
hello. How you doing?
Bob, Marshall. Marshall, Bob.
uh, we were just about to order pizza and watch the game.
you want to join us?
Thanks, but I can't stay. I just need a moment with Patrick.
Oh, sure thing.
what's the problem?
you called someone in Houston from your landline.
I did. - You called a florist.
did the flowers you sent include a note with your name?
what about payment?
is there a credit card out there that someone could trace?
uh, let me think.
you have to tell me the truth, Patrick.
I can't do a full threat assessment without all the details.
I know, I know.
Patrick, you're hiding something.
and I think it has to do with your friend in there, the one with the strong Texas accent.
do you know him from your previous life?
Yes.
that's extremely bad.
how long has he been in Albuquerque?
since I got here.
that's
even worse.
Bob, can I speak to you a moment?
I say this without bias or accusation, but am I correct in surmising that you two are a couple,
and for some reason, you want that to be a secret?
I don't. I never did.
did I? I've been saying from day one.
I just want to keep my private life private.
please.
look, I wanted to send my mother flowers For her birthday.
I forgot the rule about the phone.
that's because the rules were never explained to you, because you're not actually supposed to be here.
sorry. All right.
look, this is not about sexual orientation.
the program recognizes domestic partnerships.
what it doesn't recognize is the right To bring someone along in secret.
and by the way, Bob, you've been here Since day one?
I've checked this place a thousand times.
are you two sharing clothing and toiletries?
I live across the courtyard in my own place.
God forbid, we live together openly.
can we not start, for once?
Oh, please, we're way past start here, Patrick.
look, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have misled you.
I should have told you about us.
but I... I just couldn't.
my family-- they'd never understand.
Patrick, I don't mean to be glib, but if ever there was an opportunity to let go of what your family thinks,
it's in witness protection, where you will never see them again.
you see?
this... This is what I'm dealing with-- A lunatic.
Bob, I need the name of every person from Texas with whom you've been in contact Since your arrival in Albuquerque
and the name of every person those people might have told about your presence here.
are you trying to scare me?
no, I'm trying to scare both of you.
I need that list now.
please!
good afternoon.
Hi, tippy.
ms. Cusato...
Mia, because of the severity of your condition and the strong chance that you might not make it trial, - About which I sincerely hope I'm wrong-- - Okay.
well, we saw this coming. So here you go.
united States vs. Carlton Marchak
do you know it?
felony kidnapping.
mail carrier intervenes, gets shot in the process, dies in the hospital.
and on his death bed, he gives taped testimony, Which helps secure the conviction.
Yeah, so you people live for precedent.
here it is-- signed, sealed, and delivered.
there's-- there's some very key differences.
the witness was a mailman, not a member of a crime family.
she was inside, Tippy.
she knows the family up, down, and sideways.
y-you're telling me she's not as good a witness As a dead letter carrier.
first, Mia, the defense would try to use your tumor as a way to undermine the credibility of your testimony.
they would say that you were confused, that you're imagining things.
and we'd have no opportunity for redirect.
God, you can't be serious.
then there's the matter of the shooting.
I don't doubt it was in self-defense, But your cousin never got to his weapon.
that's undisputed-- - No, you're right.
she should have waited. She'd be gone now.
I'd be out for a jog. You could be doing the crossword. Christ!
Mary. - What?
you know, sometimes I have to say yes to cases I don't care for, and no to ones I do.
Mia, believe me, I know what it's like to have your body betray you.
I am deeply, deeply sorry.
if there was anything more I could do-- - Are you kidding me?
there are a million things you could do.
you could color outside the lines for once, God damn it.
she's here to do something right, Something we all want done.
sack up, Tippy.
it's fine. Mr. Boswell, thank you.
Yeah. Thanks.
just so you know, I'm not accepting this outcome.
it goes without saying.
you can't just put her out on the street.
I mean, forget the protection we promised.
she's literally got nothing-- no income, nowhere to go.
there's got to be something we can do.
could be. I'll get into it.
I knew it. I knew you'd think of something. What is it?
just let me do a little recon, okay? It's tricky, Mary.
Stan, right now A "maybe" would feel like winning the lotto.
okay, maybe.
you leaving early?
Ah, I thought I'd go check on Mia, See if she feels like hanging out tonight.
what? What's that mean?
it implies understanding.
no, it implies you think you know something, Something even I don't know.
"ah" is Marshall-speak for arrogant.
you like her.
I don't hate her.
which for you is tantamount to eternal fealty.
would you go so far as to say that under different circumstances, you might be, dare I say, friends?
what's your point?
no matter what you do or feel for her, She's not gonna be here long.
and that you can't change.
Yeah, well, what I can do is make it better. Thanks, sunshine.
I know that you can make it better.
just don't make it worse for yourself.
I love when you talk to me in greeting card.
I'm serious, Mary.
that's why you're so lucky to have me. Where you're blind, I see.
where I'm smart, you're an idiot.
symbiosis personified.
I was so happy that you called, Well, that you even wanted to meet me.
don't be silly. Of course.
we're practically... Well, at least mutually intrigued.
so... James never told you about us?
no, but I get the feeling He felt bad about leaving you.
what makes you say that?
well, he was always telling me that, uh, One of the worst things you can do Is intentionally hurt the people you love.
that's ironic.
too bad he didn't take his own advice.
what?
that thing you're doing with your eyebrow-- He used to do that, your father.
no, no, no, no. It's okay.
I just--I just hadn't thought about it in ages.
it's like watching home movies or something.
listen, this can't be easy for you either.
my dad had a steady job. I mean, he traveled a lot for work, but he loved us.
scam artist, a bank robber-- I mean, this guy that Brandi and Mary talk about
it's just--I don't know. That's not him.
Oh, it is, though, believe me.
that's the man I married.
that's your father.
well, it's not all of him, though.
well... You'd know better than me.
um, listen, Scott, There's something I-I want to say... That I need to.
it's more likely that...You'll see your father again before I do.
and I'd like you to tell him something.
I'm doing great.
my life is truly great... Without him.
could you?
could you do that for me?
Oh, my God, this lasagna-- You are now officially the Italian grandmother I never had.
Oh, shut up.
whatever you say, Nonna.
so your niece-- she's back there, I take it, with them?
unfortunately.
she's like a daughter to me, so this being apart, it's brutal.
you never had kids?
couldn't... Which is maybe a good thing.
my husband was a sack of, let's say, rocks.
don't know why I ever married him.
I never really loved anyone except Robin.
I was scared to death of my father.
my mother-- she was just a shell.
I get that. Trust me.
Ah, you're just saying that so I feel less alone.
it's a kind lie, but it's a lie.
it's not, I swear.
and my father was, well...
let's just say, If he'd known your family, he would have fit right in.
your dad was a crook?
I shouldn't really be talking about this.
Why? I'm not a witness. I'm not in WITSEC.
besides, anything you say goes straight to the grave.
nice.
okay, so no husband, boyfriend?
I can't really talk about it. - Come on.
it has nothing to do with security. It's just embarrassing and pathetic.
okay, then here's to talking about nothing, Bitching about everything, and
the daughters of bad men.
we have to relocate you.
arrangements are being made.
God, Marshall. I-I don't know if I can do it again.
if you want to be with Bob, He has to enter the program with you.
or we move you alone, and you never see him again.
I don't know.
I honestly don't know what to do.
don't take this the wrong way, but it's 2010.
we have a liberal administration, legalized marriage in a number of States.
do you really feel that coming out would be that difficult?
well, don't take this the wrong way, But that's a pretty easy thing to say
when you're not a gay man from a conservative family in Texas.
you're right. I'm sorry.
I've done this my whole life... Compartmentalized, avoided.
my dad's a good person...
with strong opinions on who goes to hell and why.
I leave you with two words... Dick Cheney.
see you tomorrow.
we all want to have an effect, leave a mark to show we were even here.
I get that.
it's why kids scrawl in wet cement and cavemen drew on walls.
why you do what you do, no?
Hey, Stan. - I just made your night.
we figured out a way for us to help Mia.
what? Seriously?
we got her money for lodging, incidentals.
it's not a new identity, but-- - Oh, Stan, you made my night.
thank you. - Don't thank me.
thank Allison Pearson.
and I mean that literally. She's expecting your call.
Ah, victory. Why such a bitter aftertaste?
pop a tic tac. And then call her.
Bye.
what's going on?
well... There's not gonna be a trial.
but you do get to stay in Albuquerque.
you'll be taken care of.
I'll be taken care of? - Yeah.
what is that?
you pulling strings for the poor dying girl-- That's eggshells, Mary.
that's exactly what I didn't want. Do you even listen?
hang on.
you feel sorry for me? Great, get in line.
you and your boss get a bunch of other people To feel sorry for me, So I can die in this climate-controlled rat hole?
what? - And I'm supposed to feel grateful?
Mia, maybe I'm not being clear, okay?
you're gonna have a place to live, a stipend. I can look in on you.
Yeah, no.
the look of growing pity in your eyes as I become more and more useless, every hour?
really looking forward to that.
we're down the road, Mary. And I promise you, I mean this, leave now, get out.
get out.
mom?
what are you doing?
thinking.
Ah, so I see.
I met Scott today.
Scott, right.
thank you, Brandi.
Oh, it's not her fault.
I wanted to see him. I wanted to hear about your father...
find a way to tell him how much better my life is now.
it is. - Oh, is it?
Yes. - Well, I tell myself that.
I just don't know anymore.
and it hurts.
and I want it to stop!
since when does hurting equal better?
you know, mom... I don't want to say your problems are less significant than other people's.
but your problems are less significant than other people's.
and I mean that in the nicest, most UN-me way.
some people are all alone.
they have no family at all.
your--your life is good.
how about not terrible?
okay. Okay, not terrible.
come on, call your sponsor. Go to a meeting. Let--let me drive you.
no, no, no, no.
I'll be fine.
I'll be not terrible soon. Good night.
Hey, Mia.
I wanted to apologize for being such a bitch before and to say good-bye.
I'm going to Kansas City to see Robin.
no, you're not. - Yes, Mary, I am. I have to.
no, Mia, look, As soon as you set foot in Kansas City, you're dead.
you get why that's funny, right?
no, I'm having a hard time finding the funny right now.
look, I get why this feels like a good idea
I didn't call to get talked out of it, Mary, And I didn't call for another round of pity.
Jesus, Mia, enough with the pity, okay? This isn't pity.
this is my twisted version of friendship.
do you want it or not?
I'll take your silence to mean "hell, yes." I'll see you in ten.
Mary, you don't have to-- - Oh, shut up.
come on, please.
don't do this.
what's the emergency?
I asked him to come with me, and he said no.
I'm going back to Houston.
talk some sense into him, Marshall. He'll listen to you.
I don't know what to say except this doesn't actually constitute an emergency.
this is over.
look, they're moving me to-- - Duh-duh-duh!
another state.
just-- I can tell you everything, As soon as you say you'll come with me.
but I can't go without you.
I want to be with you. I want us to be together... Really together.
I'm sorry. I just-- I just don't believe you.
I hope you'll be happy and safe In your new secret life.
prove it.
what?
what you're saying-- prove it.
excuse me.
um, I'm Patrick hill.
I-I live across the courtyard.
I know. Yes, but...
do you know that I'm gay?
see... I love this man.
his name is Bob.
all right, you and Bob have a good day.
I hate to step on a moment, but your new WITSEC inspector's gonna be here in two hours.
think you can both be packed and ready to go?
we will be.
seriously... You should probably... Probably start packing.
the trick to grilling, Marco, Is you got to wait for the grate to get red-hot.
when you throw the meat on, you're making a commitment, You know what I'm saying?
not so much, sir.
I'm saying you don't even check it.
you want to take a peek, see how it's going.
that's a sucker's move-- four minutes then flip.
I like mine medium, little pink in the middle.
who the hell are you supposed to be?
a guest with a badge, asshole, so back up.
auntie Mia? - Hey, baby.
the stones you got coming back here.
stupid is what it is.
I'm not here to cause trouble, Richie-- Just to talk to Robin.
I need a minute alone.
Robin, you sit down.
I think you can give her a minute, Probably even five.
dad... I'd like to hear what Mia has to say.
no, no. No, no, no, no. No pockets.
put your hands where I can see them... Now.
did you kill cousin Benny, like they say?
Yes, I did... Right before he tried to kill me.
Robin... I had to do all this, and the reasons why make my heart ache for you.
I just want to tell you to run.
run fast and far.
make a new life for yourself.
but this is our family. - Exactly. It is.
and some of it you get to inherit, And some of it you get to pick, like Marco.
don't marry him because you're supposed to, because you're already in this far.
marry him because...
you want his face beside yours In a scrapbook your grandkids are looking through,
because you can't stand the thought Of not waking up next to him when you're 80.
you're making him your life.
why are you saying this?
you're scaring me, like we're not gonna see each other again.
we won't, baby.
it's just not possible.
but I need to say I love you.
I needed to say good-bye.
maybe I could... Maybe just come with you.
no, you can't, baby. I wish I could take you with me, But...
now... I'm not afraid.
it's weird, but I'm not... As long as I know you'll take care of yourself.
I will. I promise.
okay. I'm gonna hold you to that.
I can count the witnesses I've admired on a hand and a half.
the ones I liked, fewer still.
but when it comes to those I was truly friends with, I can't put a number on it.
I don't need to.
it's just Mia... Someone who wouldn't be around for very long.
I know--somewhere a therapist's couch beckons.
Hello?
Mia lived 42 years.
all she wanted in the end Was to have made a difference in one life.
she did. She absolutely did.
I know what she'd say if she heard all this.
"Oh, shut up"-- her version of "rest in peace.
you want me to... Go with you?
I should do it alone.
Why? I'm here. Come on.
you think-- You think maybe we could talk tomorrow?
my day was just... Well, it's difficult to describe.
I just wanted to thank you.
everything you said really put things in perspective.
and I-I-I just want to tell you I finally found my place... In the world.
and that makes me... Proud.
I just... I just need to feel it more.
you do, mom. You do.
you should feel proud. You should feel proud Of everything you've accomplished.
not being proud-- I learned that from my mother.
and I'm... I'm so worried I passed it on to Brandi.
I sure as hell didn't pass it on to you.
but you passed on a lot of good things... To both of us.
I'm sorry about your day, honey.
you don't have to talk to me if you don't want to.
a friend died.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I really am.
her name was Mia.
tell me about her.
she was this...
Miami, FLORIDA 2004
Riley. - What's up, Orlando?
time for you to turn around, man.
I'm just here to get paid. - Me too.
but, you see, tonight I'm taking everything.
Riley, bail!
make no mistake. Buying a car or coping a plea.
deal-making is a blood sport.
when a witness lands in my doorstep,
so I set him up...
a new name, address, a job we hope he won't hate.
but the one thing I can't give him.
the deal I've yet to strike, is the one that protects him from the guy in the mirror.
well, what if I don't testify?
get word to the Bahamian cartel that I'll just keep my mouth shut.
you could do that. Then you'd lose your immunity.
do 10 to 15 for Grand Theft Auto, and spend the rest of your incarcerated life looking over your shoulder for a rastafarian with a shank.
life's gonna be less fun. - That's our WITSEC motto.
and so it begins.
an idiotic Greek philosopher once said...
nothing endures but change.
but any WITSEC inspector on the job longer than a week will tell you, it's resistance to change that truly endures.
we cling to the life raft of who we are, even as the pounding sound of waterfalls grow louder in our ears.
half a sub?
Thanks.
present DAY - What? - What? You know what.
look, I'm working on it!
I shouldn't have to remind you, Mary.
it's too conspicuous. We have to fly below the radar.
just like the witnesses. - What's the matter, Stan?
got muscle car envy?
so happens back when I was working warrants, I drove a '69 GTO Judge.
I was Vin Diesel before Vin Diesel was Vin Diesel.
you know Vin's a chrome dome by choice, right?
but when I got promoted to WITSEC, I had to move on.
it's time to move on, Mary. - Look, I loved my old car.
Ah, the probe. - I miss the probe.
I never thought I'd get attached to this muscle car.
turns out I'm more superficial than I thought.
the 'stang is too identifiable.
Yeah. I said 'stang.
and if you become too identifiable, you not only put your witnesses in danger, Mary, but your partner.
apparently, the 'stang is putting me in danger, Mary.
it so happens all I care about is the well-being of my partner.
I'm impressed. - With what?
you seem to be following a direct order.
I always follow a direct order.
unless, you know, it's stupid.
I'm also impressed you seem to be rolling with change.
it's not something at which you're adept.
Hey, I'm adept at change.
I mean, did I not go on vacation with Faber?
no one, inuding me, thought I could vacate, and I vacated.
and during your so-called vacation, you convinced Faber to go make things work with his ex-wife and kids, which proves my thesis that you prefer a known situation that's deeply flawed to an unknown situation potentially free of flaws.
you're obviously adept at being wrong.
I'm all about change.
Oh, man, it's the same color!
angry aubergine.
I searched for it far and wide, found it at a used car dealer in Resolute, Kentucky.
dealer didn't wanna sell it because he said he believed in God and he was sure it was a sin to make money off this
and I'm quoting - "Chariot of Satan"
it has 140, 000 miles on it!
look, Mary, there's no reason for you to regress back into a probe.
let me put you in a new loaner. - The only reason
I'm back in the probe is Mr. Headroom here.
the probe is a known situation that is deeply flawed.
or, seen through another lens, bite me.
Oh, look at this...
Gorgeousness!
Oh, man!
when that car comes back to me, and it will, please consider a new model.
you'd be doing me a favor, 'cause I wouldn't have to worry about getting sideways with God.
Hi, Marshall. - Hi, Mary.
you believe Peter found you that old wreck?
I know.
honey...
I need the keys.
sold.
easy as "abc"- - always be closin'.
this is too easy.
you got a deal!
Peter - Before you say anything,
I wanna show you something.
Brandi has climbed to number five on the big sales board.
technically, I would classify that as a petite sales board.
she's a - Has always loved all motor vehicles.
Brandi is making her own money and feeling really good about herself, so big favor - just don't "Mary" the situation.
what - what does that mean? "Mary" the situation?
perhaps it means speaking the unfiltered harsh truth when a respectful silence might be more appropriate.
okay, all right, first of all, don't turn my name into a verb.
look, I'm just - I'm trying to warn you, Peter.
Brandi gets distracted. Easily.
just don't expect her to stay on your petite sales board for long.
you know what's hard to acknowledge?
your little sister's growing up. Brandi's changed.
Hey, hey - he'll be the first to confirm this.
I'm all about change.
I just don't know that she's capable of it.
Peter, every time my little sister's gotten a new life path or - or boyfriend or job, it ends in disaster.
or a word that sounds less harsh but means the same thing.
Pete, we got a problem. - I'll be there in a minute.
this can't wait. Six cars were stolen off the back lot.
what?
this is me being respectfully silent.
since 1970, the federal Witness Protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is... Somebody wants them dead.
Brendan, good to see you!
coffee?
Hello, Tim!
they stole two Audis, two Porches, two Mercedes.
what, are they building an ark?
so they can steal six cars, and they can't open a gate.
why does everyone but me feel this crushing need to be liked?
you find that an inherent weakness?
and you made this snap judgment based on a woman bringing her coworkers coffee?
my snap judgment, which some would call seasoned law enforcement instincts, tells me that any female detective who has to play the "ooh, look at me, "I'm wearing porno eye shadow and bringing you hot beverages" card isn't clearing many cases. Come on.
you don't think she's working just a little too hard?
well, Marshall Mann!
what is a federal lawman doing working a local Grand Theft Auto?
you may not know that the Judiciary Act of 1789
gives federal marshals 50-State jurisdiction to execute all lawful precepts, and...
to command all necessary assistance in the execution of their duty.
Hello, Mary Shannon! Abigail Chaffee. Coffee?
how is ...That I know you?
Albuquerque's not that big a town.
so why is it - You don't know me?
well, I am the new girl from the great Republic of Texas.
hook 'em horns. - Lord, no!
our family is four generations SMU.
go, Mustangs.
Mr. Alpert, do you have security camera coverage?
no. The cameras don't pick up this back part of the lot.
that's why we have the giant, impenetrable gate.
keys missing? - All the cars were keyless entry, but the key fobs are still in the lockbox, and the GPS antitheft systems never pinged at the satellite.
I'm gonna need employment records of everyone who ever worked here.
don't think it was one of my guys.
most of them have been with me for years.
and one or more of them helped steal six of your cars.
is there anything you need to tell me?
okay. Your non-answer's less comforting than you might think.
so typical of you to think that this has anything to do with me.
I'm sorry. All those with Grand Theft Auto convictions in their past, please raise your hand.
that's ancient history. Teenage stuff.
you think the cops'll see it that way?
okay. This cannot be happening.
so I'm asking you again.
did someone convince you to help them with this?
why would I help somebody steal cars from my own dealership?
okay, look.
I've been known to screw things up with guys. Fine.
but you draw bad men to you like an electron magnet.
you do.
not this time. No.
I finally have a good man and a job that I really like, and I rock at it.
so please, I have to make sure Peter doesn't find out about my GTA conviction.
look, he already knows about a suitcase full of meth and a murder conviction.
why would he care about an ex-boyfriend's car you took for a joyride in - in high school?
it's just... He can't find out - not now.
I don't want him to regret his decision.
his decision to hire a car thief to sell cars?
this decision.
sparkly.
I wanted to tell you over drinks tonight.
I don't wear it at work, because I sell more cars if guys think that I'm single.
how come you don't look happy for me?
I'd be blowing champagne bubbles out of my ass if I wasn't absolutely certain that you're gonna be arrested for Grand Theft Auto.
Brandi, listen to me.
you need to tell me exactly what happened so I can try to help you.
Mary, I know my credibility is shot with you, but nothing happened.
so please...
a lot of good things are happening for me right now, and I do not want it all ruined.
could you... make some calls?
find out who did this. Please.
you know people.
as you saw in the posting, we're looking to promote and train a deputy marshal for WITSEC, which I like to think of as the elite branch of the Marshal Service.
that's what they say at FIST.
Wow. FIST. Yeah.
those fugitive investigative strike team guys know how to pick a sexy acronym, don't they?
they sure garner a lot of flashy headlines, but we're not really in the flashy headline business, just the business of protecting witnesses whose testimony puts away hundreds of more criminals than sexy-acronymic FIST could ever dream of.
what are you doing?
uh, your desk accessories were misaligned.
let me ask you something, deputy Eberhardt.
Oh. Don't pronounce the "T."
excuse me? - It's Eberhard. Silent "t."
got it.
yes? - Stan.
Marshall and I need to go off the grid.
Brandi got herself jammed up again.
anything I can do to help?
say yes?
I want to use one of my witnesses as a consultant.
Mary, that's thin WITSEC ice.
so that's a yes?
there is precedent.
we work that way with some of Cosa Nostra boys, but Mary, your personal life with your witness, it's...
I know, I know. Church and State.
Jesus, I'm not a retard.
sorry, deputy Eberhardt.
uh... Eberhard. Right.
we're looking for team members with high levels of flexibility.
how would you deal with...
Oh, say for instance...a difficult, overbearing coworker who might tend to be a bit acidy or snide?
I detest discord in the work environment.
we'll be in touch.
you're back in the probe and off on a mission on which we have no investigative jurisdiction to protect your little sister.
where have I seen this movie before?
two dates.
I seem to have bypassed the conversational off-ramp.
Nancy Drew, teen detective.
my operational theory is that you've had two dates, and the jeans haven't hit the floor yet.
have I mentioned that I admire your fierce advocacy for your sister?
I am wondering, however, if we're on this quixotic mission to help clear your sister, in the event she's innocent, or to confirm your belief that she's not.
and your conversational bypass tells me that I'm exactly right
you still haven't slept with little miss "I just got my braces off."
seriously, Marshall, you want a side of red sports car to go with that midlife crisis?
your claws are showing. - They don't retract.
I gotta tell you, I am both annoyed and impressed that you kept this little relationship a secret from me.
keeping secrets is part and parcel of our chosen profession.
only the cheerleader doesn't seem your type.
I defy you to categorize the women I've dated as belonging to one specific type.
if anyone, it is you who has a deeply ingrained pattern - to your romantic involvements. - Right. Yeah. Okay.
Dominican ball player and divorcee FBI agent.
peas in a pod, those two. - Both Raph and Faber believe that no matter how tough and independent a woman is, underneath it all, she wants a white picket fence and 2- 5 kids.
that's why you didn't marry Raph and Faber went back to sort things out with his ex-wife and 2. 5 kids.
what are you saying - my type is guys that don't get me?
in point of fact, your type is guys that you don't get don't get you.
but this only applies to long-term relationships.
short-term, you will your words, not mine - drop jeans with just about anyone.
what? Oh...I see.
okay. Sorry. So you're pissy cause I called Nancy Drew a cheerleader.
I'm sorry, Marshall.
I'm sorry. I was wrong - very wrong.
it's been three dates.
Wow. You look like crap.
Thanks.
look, I didn't boost six rides. And if I did, believe me,
I wouldn't be sitting here wiping crud off a golf cart battery.
how'd you know about the cars?
I have a police scanner. Brings me back.
miss it? - Look around.
what do you think? - Look, for the record, we never thought you had anything to do with the thefts.
they're not your style. - So you're visiting to tell me the Bahamian cartel no longer wants me dead?
I can leave the program? - No, that's not why I'm here.
I wish it were.
I need a favor. It's vehicular.
all right.
I'll help you guys out with the thefts.
for a small finder's fee, of course.
but I need a favor from you first.
it's medical.
so, uh, thank that doctor for the WITSEC family discount.
sure.
I never thought I'd be the guy needing the happy pills.
half the world's on them. Join the masses.
you?
probably not.
look at me.
you know, I...
I don't know how this happened to me.
it's like... I used to roll out of bed, ready to go, and now I have trouble waking up or even caring if I do wake up.
am I supposed to tear up because you're not stealing cars anymore?
no. All right.
what if one day you couldn't be a marshal?
what if one day all that adrenaline just...
vanished?
all right. I guess I feel a little sorry for you.
Thanks. - So... Riley.
how does someone steal six cars?
there's 50 ways those cars coulda been stolen.
back before I needed these, I used to romance the cars away.
these days, every luxury car has a different keyless entry and ignition system.
now, any teenager can hop on the Internet and download some code-grabbing software that opens up the car and starts 'em up.
but that's only the second hardest part of boosting the ride.
don't keep a girl waiting.
the GPS antitheft system.
when you press the key fob, the GPS sends a signal up to a satellite.
even when the car's turned off, the manufacturer can ping the car.
the way you're gonna solve these thefts, figure out how the car crew disabled the antitheft system.
unless they were a really top shelf crew, they had to have somebody on the inside.
you know, if you want, I can go over to the dealership, - pop my head in - No. No, okay?
do not.
no catnip for kitty.
I just needed your larcenous expertise.
I hope it helped.
someone you know get jammed up for this?
what? No. Why?
why else would a WITSEC inspector be involved?
sometimes I have to do an immediate relocation on a witness, and there's no time to pack a bag.
so... here.
I'm sad. I'm not homeless.
then dress like it. And shave.
and shower. - Hint received.
thanks for the info.
thanks for, uh... for everything.
that meal was delicious.
well, I am an expert at watching the food network and downloading the recipes.
it's the... actual cooking part that I'm not so sure about yet, so...
let me see how the ring looks on you.
did Peter tell you that I helped him pick it out?
what? - Thanks, mom.
I was trying to create the impression that I'm the one with taste.
sorry.
full disclosure?
I kind of had a hunch that your mom was behind this, - so... thank you, dora. - You wear it well.
welcome to the family, Brandi.
Cheers. - I like it.
Hal, thanks. Uh...
things were a bit rocky in my house growing up, and... well, I just don't know how I got so lucky to meet Peter and the two of you, so...
well, you know you're joining a very close-knit family.
Dora and I feel like Peter and his sister is the reason we were put on this earth.
I'm sure your parents feel the same way about you.
which is why, in the spirit of full disclosure,
I think you should take a look at this.
dad... - No, look through it.
it's just a little security blanket.
it's a prenup. And this is an ambush.
mom, please tell me you didn't know about this.
look, darling, this is--it's--it's not personal.
it's just about your business and your father's.
mom, it's not just about business when you say you don't trust my fiancee, and by extension, you don't trust me.
did some other parents sit with you in family therapy?
did they come visit you in rehab, clean up your vomit, not know if their son was gonna live another day?
please - okay. Peter, this is
I don't want to come between you and your family.
that's fine,cause my parents were just leaving - and never coming back. - Peter!
I used to drink.
but at the bottom of the hole I dug for myself,
I never hurt anyone this badly, and more importantly,
Brandi's never done anything to betray your trust.
Brandi Shannon?
Albuquerque police. Miss Shannon, will you come with us, please?
Oh, great. Everyone's here to pick up the inside man.
got this.
I'm assuming you have concrete evidence linking my sister to this crime, otherwise, I'm not clear why you dragged her in here for questioning.
questioning is how we gather evidence. I'm sure you're aware of her Grand Theft Auto conviction.
15 years ago, because of a high school dirt bag boyfriend.
and her jacket has some more recent activity. Suspect in a murder investigation?
because of a different dirt bag boyfriend. Sensing a pattern?
what makes you think there isn't another dirt bag in the picture maybe at the dealership?
detective, this was a sophisticated crime.
you can accuse my sister of many things sophistication isn't one of them.
please tell me you have more realistic suspects.
you know I can't discuss the investigation with you, but as you are a friend of the department, I can tell you Brandi is a person of interest.
Oh, person of interest. You know, she's not an astronaut or a research scientist, so don't pretty it up with police blotter spin...just say it.
she's a suspect.
you're protecting your sister. I would do the same.
but fair warning...I'm not letting anyone get in the way of my investigation.
good. Got it. Fair warning...my little sister's not getting railroaded.
Brandi, the police don't have anything except your record.
it doesn't matter. Your parents are now convinced that you're engaged to a car thieving gold digger.
I don't know how to make this clearer. I don't care what my parents think.
the only way I could have appeared more white trash is if the police had tackled me on an astroturf lanai in front of a double-wide.
look, you can be as angry at my parents as you want. I'm on your side.
your fiancee is telling you I don't think you're a car thief, and I don't think you're white trash, and if you are, so am I, and I'm buying us both a double-wide.
you can't see where this is headed, can you?
I'm hoping home.
here. This should save your parents all of the hard work of splitting us up.
bran - Hey. I got this.
a million dollars.
that's right.
if the marriage ended before five years. More if it went longer.
Wow. That is...Awesome.
Mary - What?
I mean... - If a marriage starts out like a deal, then that's what it is.
it's a deal. - It's a marriage contract. It's a deal.
when I was sitting there with Peter's parents, I would have signed it just to keep the peace.
but I thought about it, what it all means and...
if I sign it, that means that I'm somebody that they need legal protection from, like I am who they think I am.
squish, look at us. I mean, honestly.
mom spent most of her life looking through the bottom of a Canadian Club bottle.
dad robbed banks and parachuted out on us.
I mean, you got hooked up with a meth dealer who tried to kill me, and I've made pushing good men away an art form.
so maybe we are who the Alberts think we are.
who cares?
I'm changing.
I can see your face, you know. I'm right here.
I realize that I've said I'm changing probably so many times that it seems comical to you.
but think about this, okay? I mean, what would I have done before?
I would have signed that prenup and taken the prize money.
all right, so what's the problem?
Peter doesn't want you to sign it, and he still wants to marry you, right? Win-win.
except it would end Peter's relationship with his parents
Yeah, but he's a big boy. That's his problem.
no, what? And...Start our life out with huge regrets?
what if we have kids, Mary? What, are they not gonna see their grandparents?
I mean, don't you get it? In the long-term, Peter's gonna end up resenting me.
so what's the long-term plan, then? You're back here with me instead of with Peter?
gotta say, I'm not a big fan of the long-term strategy.
God, Mary.
same old stuff, right?
Brandi screws up and comes back to stay in your guest room?
well, I didn't screw up this time, and if you can't see that, then maybe you need to look in the mirror.
maybe you're the one who needs to change.
good night.
there's no bed in there.
I know. Mom took it for her new place. It's a... junk room now.
sorry.
okay. Thanks. We'll be there in 20 minutes.
got something.
Tess Yates over at the FBI did some digging.
she came up with a GTA investigation in Oklahoma City.
matches the MO of Peter's dealership.
and you know what Oklahoma City and Albuquerque have in common?
I-40. They have suspects?
two Samoans that run a car crew.
Yates is gonna show us what she has.
I think Washington wants us to say pacific islanders.
Yeah. That's gonna happen.
Jesus. Why does Stan wanna hire a new inspector?
we're understaffed.
Yeah, but new people?
they're all... new. What's with Bill Gates in there?
before I joined the marshals, I got a degree from the Naval School of Computer Science.
that's very impressive, but here at WITSEC we don't rely much on computers.
are you saying I'm a better fit for FIST?
no. I'm saying that this department focuses more on people skills.
a-are you saying you don't think I'm cut out for FIST?
scuse me for sec, will you?
how's it going with Brandi?
she's a person of interest.
I hate that phrase. - Don't get me started.
headed over to meet Yates. Wanna join?
can't. Keep me updated. That's an order.
God, I'm so glad you're back.
just to do my job. - Okay.
can we talk? - Employee to boss.
fiance to fiancee?
did you apologize to your parents?
apologize to them for what?
for saying that they should leave and never come back.
they need to apologize to us.
I'm not breaking up your family, Peter. I know what it's like. Trust me.
sales agent needed on the floor.
and now, if you'll excuse me, I have an up.
well, hey, there.
Hi. I'm Brandi. - Riley.
Riley! Uh... let's skip the sedans.
we're gonna go straight to sports cars.
you like this one? - Does anyone say no?
don't even bother looking at the sticker price, because this one's a steal.
we'll see.
this meeting's officially unofficial, correct?
correct.
Oh, boy. Please tell me when we look at the dealership security video, we see these two nimrods checking out cars, preferably not with my sister.
you won't get that lucky. We only got tipped off to the Tatupo brothers from an informant who used to work in their crew.
any way you could unofficially contact the informant for us?
I would be glad to, but I'd have to be able to commune with the dead.
I brought afternoon muffins. Are you more of a bran or a blueberry?
is anyone bran, really? - Oh, I am. They clean me right out.
blueberry for me, thank you.
thank you.
so... deputy Parmalee I'm sorry to interrupt.
let me know if that bothers you, because I do that a lot.
but the deputy marshal network thrives on gossip, so I know you're having difficulties finding someone to train for WITSEC.
these days, seems everyone's interested in FIST.
well, that's not really - And the scuttlebutt. That's a funny word, scuttlebutt...
is you're having a problem finding someone who can get along with Mary Shannon, so...and I'm not going to take no for an answer I want to come back for a second interview with you and Mary.
I don't see that happening.
you see, you're kind of sunny...a quality I admire, by the way, but Mary is... less so.
you're the chief inspector in this office, right?
Yes. Yes, I am.
then you'll make it happen.
I never for a moment considered applying to FIST.
Riley really have new info, or is he angling for a belgium waffle?
said he has some ideas about how a car crew might have his words, not mine... boosted the rides.
probably the waffle.
what? You're doing the "not so good news" face.
message from Abigail.
security video has confirmed your sister was the last one out of the dealership that night.
Why's Abigail telling you that?
cause I asked.
Wow. Still waters.
does the security video show Brandi committing any crimes?
none. - So? Coincidence.
a lot of 'em. - Stop making the face.
look, if Brandi's involved it's because she was taken advantage of by some douche bag guy.
it's the Brandi Shannon story.
Oh, my lord.
what's up? - It's amazing. I own exactly the same suit.
I think I was crystal clear，no, I'm sure I was crystal clear.
I asked you how those cars were stolen. I didn't ask you to steal a car.
now I have to arrest you. - Arrest me?
you're gonna thank me. - For what?
for stealing a $150, 000 car? - Look, I know you told me not to go down to the dealership, but I had to figure out how the car crew did it. It's a point of professional pride.
so you stole one for yourself.
this blond sales chick - smokin' hot, by the way.
she practically begged me to steal the car. She made it so easy.
this dealership was full of security leaks.
I got the ignition and entry code in 30 seconds.
she kept her password... on a post-it.
Jersey girl. Oh, and this.
old gum? - Lead putty.
I found it on the ground where the cars were stolen.
they put that on the GPS antenna. Totally blocks the satellite signal.
so the blond was probably the inside person in the crew?
no way. Too ditzy.
rippin' body, though. Smokin' hot.
Yeah. No. You said. - I think that they were taking the cars someplace where they were warehousing snowplows.
Snowplows? - Yeah. You see the salt in there? Looks like road salt.
it's not road salt. Could possibly be...
you didn't put the lead putty in the car you took, did you?
move. - You protect your witness.
go, go, go! - I'll deal with the law.
check the car. - Car's clear!
there's no one in the car, ma'am. I'm gonna check around back.
hands in the air! - Freeze!
stand down, gentlemen.
so have you turned to a life of crime?
just helping clear the name of an innocent person of interest.
I'm beginning to wonder if I've picked the right boyfriend.
boyfriend? Is it official now?
it's been witnessed by three sworn officers of the law.
now, do you wanna tell me why you stole this vehicle?
so I could solve your case.
of course you minored in Geology.
with all the time you two spend together, how did you not know that?
cause nobody knows what anyone minored in.
Marshall, what'd I minor in? - Jagermeister?
Oh. I stand corrected. - Salado Mesa is basically an effacement of salts, salado translating roughly as "salty"
the Mesa Salt Company was one of the largest salt producers in the world until the Pakistanis began dominating the industry.
if I fall asleep at the wheel, it's on you.
I am, however, very interested.
to the north of the property is the original Mesa Salt mine.
to the South is the last mine built before the factory ceased operations.
I figured either would be an ideal place to hide a chop shop.
and either location could account for the large, unrefined salt granules found in the lead putty.
I enjoy your theory. But I have spent too many hours in my unmarked following down leads that go nowhere.
you are gonna owe me big-time for taking personal time to track down this lead.
what, exactly, did you have in mind?
Oh, my God, I'm gonna hurl. - What did Mary say?
she said she's going to hurl. - Don't hurl, Mary.
I'll check out the north. You two take the South.
copy that.
if there was a mine here, it caved in a long time ago.
maybe you're a better marshal than you are a detective.
the jury is still out, actually.
it looks like we've got something here in the South side.
give us a second.
we've got some tire tracks. Could be off-roaders or...
maybe not.
Marshall... Marshall talk to me!
taking fire! Call for backup!
shots fired off Salado Mesa Road. Mile marker 39.
those guys are huge. - That gun is huge.
make sure you save one bullet.
for what? - So you can kill my sister.
it'd be weird for me to do it.
she had nothing to do with the Tatupo brothers.
the only time people shoot at me is because of Brandi.
you gave Riley my suit from the operation suitcase.
how is that pertinent at this moment?
just in case we... I wanted you to know that I knew.
okay! Out of the car! - U. S. Marshals!
u. S. Marshal! Put your hands up!
through the sunroof! - Put your hands up!
through the sunroof!
hands up!
chaffee, you all right? - They got me.
look, I...
guess I was kind of a douche down at the station, so... you know.
don't die or anything.
you were very douchey, Mary.
but I accept your apology.
I didn't... apologize.
what?
Mary, what are you doing?
well... I want you off my sofa.
my father's basic theory you look lovely, by the way.
is that everyone's out to screw you.
I don't wanna live my life like that.
but I still apologized to him.
uh... I'm confused. Why?
Brandi thought it was important.
Peter, no.
I don't want your parents to think I married you for the money.
sorry. Confused again.
you said if you signed that, it would confirm you're the person his parents thought you were or some... crap like that.
I decided to change their minds.
long-term thinking.
and worst-case scenario - You get the cool mil.
ignoring her. - So am I.
I just want our kids to know their grandparents.
you know, now that we're a family again, I think I want my Mustang back.
just curious. Who'd you tell Peter the finder's fee was for?
he didn't ask.
sap - He's a good man.
if you like polite, stable rich guys.
which we know is not your type.
please tell me we haven't seduced him back into a life of crime.
you showing off again, so help - Please chill.
I got a better job.
thank you. - I'll see you soon, Riley.
Yes, you will.
well... guess those pills really worked, huh?
never had to take 'em.
you asked me to consult, gave me the cheap suit, got me the test drive with the smokin' hot saleswoman, and now I'm back in the high-end rides.
you're my happy pill, Mary.
Hey, what do you know? You hear that?
that suit happens to have been a bespoke wool gabardine.
okay. Come on.
okay. Excuse me a moment, please.
you two think I don't have stroke with APD?
that I wouldn't find out about an officer-involved shooting that included two U. S. Marshals?
okay, look - I ordered you to check in.
what happened to Church and State, Mary, hmm? - Stan, we were taking a stab in the dark.
you know what? Don't speak.
Stan - No, shhzz! You're not speaking.
we're at the dawn of a new era, Mary, where my word is law.
is that understood? Is it?
you told us not to speak.
the time for being childish has passed.
so... as the first edict of the new era, our newly promoted Deputy Marshal for WITSEC--miss Delia Parmalee.
Really?
I know something that will turn that frown upside down.
morning muffins.
Stan, you can't be serious.
Oh, thinking of making some type of twisted joke, Mary?
come on. - Hmm? It so happens that deputy Parmalee graduated first in her class.
federal Law Enforcement Training Center.
that's something no one here but marshal can lay claim to.
these are delicious.
thank you. They're cappuccino with espresso cream frosting.
come on, Stan. - New regime, Mary.
we know what we are but know not what we may be.
don't talk like that. What's your point?
your mom is well-ensconced teaching ballet, your sister's engaged.
and, despite your underlying belief in her guilt, it turned out she was free of any complicity in the car theft.
my question is... What does the protective lioness do without anyone to protect?
whether it's secrets, justice or the Amazon rainforest, everyone of us protects things a thousand times a day.
it doesn't take a gun.
for most of us, protection is as quiet and reflexible as a breath.
for some, though.
for knights in shiny armor, the Lone Ranger, a boyfriend or a Mom.
protection can be a hard habit to break.
as much as we thump the Bible about the vital need to change, the fact is, we hardly ever do.
don't say it before the meeting. Now that's all I'm gonna think about.
con queso? - Con bite me.
I don't think we discussed his revising the document.
Oh, Fred. Relax. I think your case can withstand the assault on the government-issued prose.
I'm not a big fan of uncertainty.
which is why everyone in your office calls you Chicken Little.
please tell me you knew that. -I do now.
real people-person, this one.
you did mention he has the right to comment before signing, right?
comment, yes. Change, no.
I'm just filling in what Mr. Zeitlin left out, the part where the U. S. Attorney agrees to investigate my wife's murder.
local police investigated fully.
they concluded accidental mishap.
okay, look, I was a logistics officer in the army.
rand Bachmann wanted me to help him turn Genesis into the next Blackwater, so I know... I designed how they deal with threats. Okay? I taught them.
how to bribe congressmen to vote contracts their way?
no, ma'am, I did not.
once they realized that I contacted the Inspector General, that I was going to blow the whistle on their corruption, they targeted me.
only my wife's car needed an oil change.
she was driving my car. Do you understand that?
dad, dad, come on. It was an accident.
rand Bachmann makes one call to the right guy on K street, -and this location is compromised, period. -Dad, stop!
listen, Adam,
I understand your concerns...
I heard about Bachmann. He's frighteningly well-connected.
I read an expos on him in wired. com's "Danger Room.
danger room." -I'm just saying it's not that crazy.
okay. - Adam, we've never lost a witness who followed the rules.
you don't know much about the way Genesis operates, do you, sir?
I cannot sign this document as it is.
Marshall, I'm not convinced. Mr. Roston fully appreciates the strength of his bargaining position.
are you? - I am not. Look, until you testify, Adam, you got Chicken Little here by the what?
short hairs?
I would have said balls, but short hairs works.
he has no case without you. Until you testify, you own him.
this is helpful. Thanks. -So here's what's gonna happen.
Zeitlin's gonna cave on the changes you need,
Stan's gonna okay them, Marshall and I are gonna go get enchiladas, and you and your son can start acclimating to life in lovely Albuquerque.
don't be shy about the lip balm. It's dry here. We good?
okay, yeah, I guess we can rejigger it a little.
dynamite. Let the jiggering begin.
just make sure my witness shows up safe and sound at trial.
wait, safe and sound? Is that new? It's not an either/or thing?
Fred, we got this. Nothing to worry about.
worry is my middle name. -Must have been awkward at Commencement.
go back to Minnesota, Zeitlin. Tell Prince we said hi. Marshall, enchiladas.
Hey, I forgot my wallet.
stupid!
God damn it.
mar? - What? I hate you.
step aside.
Ah. Your water control valve is stuck.
there. Fixed. -Really?
Wow. How are you at drafty windows?
this? Bobby down at the dealership taught me everything I need to know.
you miss me living in the guest room and making the coffee.
I miss the coffee.
Mary, umm, there's no good way to ask this.
I'll just go get my checkbook. -No, umm,
I'd like you to be my M. O.H.
maid of Honor at my wedding.
okay, well, don't say M. O.H.
look, I know it's not exactly your thing, but what do you think?
umm, well, I'm honored that you asked me really. Honored.
just I think I know someone who would be more honored if that's possible.
mom.
mom's dying to do this.
Hey, I'd buy it right now,"but I don't write the checks, you know.
you'll have to talk to my wife.
Yeah, the apron string, it's a technique that buyers use to put off making a decision.
some day I'm gonna be looking through my wedding album,
Peter, me, and you standing beside me.
I want that picture, Mary.
I need it.
holy God, I bet you sell a crap load of cars.
think about it?
okay.
God, I hate you. - What?
no. Not you.
Joey called. He says there's a situation at the house.
I am not going anywhere until I get... -I got two coffees.
I swear to God, you're a keeper.
Joey, unless that thing's pointed at your neighbor's jacuzzi, it's not a situation.
if it was, I wouldn't be complaining.
your dad's scared. He just wants you safe.
and these fears normally resolve themselves faster than you think.
normal? Okay, home security system, fine, that's normal.
but this?
huh. There's a bold choice for a window dressing.
call your friends at wired. com.
I think we found the danger room.
since 1970, the federal Witness Protection Program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is, somebody wants them dead.
I know how this looks.
like you're trying to save money on sun block?
my testimony poses a very real threat to some very powerful, manipulative people.
I helped them run their business.
I know how I would handle a crisis like this. It wouldn't be to ignore the facts on the ground.
what facts might those be?
a car. He keeps seeing a car. -Same one for a week.
yukon with tinted windows slow-pulls past the house.
I got a license number. - A week?
so I guess you were, what, just too busy picking out plywood to let us know?
I didn't want to cry wolf. I had to be sure.
and last night the same car parked across the street.
just sat there, like, keeping watch, and that's when I knew that Genesis had pierced your alleged cloak of anonymity.
meanwhile, -I've never seen this car, and my eyes work fine.
okay, I'm just throwing this out there. Maybe a neighbor bought a new car?
I tried to tell him that. -Genesis doesn't know you're here.
and if we thought you were in any danger, we'd move you immediately.
moving is not a solution.
no matter where we go, Genesis will find us.
I'm making a stand either way. Might as well be here.
I trust this stand you're contemplating doesn't involve the use of lethal force.
nothing like that in the house. I check. Daily.
your son's going on a daily scavenger hunt for guns.
I got to say, I'm not sure plywood's your first priority.
Oh, hey, Shelly. Thanks for coming.
so Mr. Roston's having a problem adjusting to the relocation?
I'd say he's currently a standard deviation or two outside the norm.
translation... - I'll just grab Adam's WC file.
Thanks, Marshall. -Thanks, Marshall.
so how severe are we talking here?
is there concern that Adam poses a danger to himself or anyone else?
no, I mean, his head's not in the oven yet, but...
well, let's get him in for an informal eval anyway.
I'd rather be out in front of this thing.
Yeah, me too. - I'm wide open this week.
thank you. Call me.
noted. -Got a make on the Yukon Adam saw outside the house.
it's registered to a plating business near Phoenix.
our guys there say the owner's clean, no priors, no nothing.
still you have to wonder why a vehicle from Phoenix keeps idling on a Random block in Albuquerque.
Oh, Phoenix. Spooky.
Hey, mom.
no, I haven't decided yet.
cause I haven't had time.
which, if you think about it, might suggest I'm not the best candidate.
don't you have to teach six-year-olds Swan Lake or something?
got it. Mission accomplished. Bye.
running for office? -Away from it actually.
Brandi's in the market for a maid of honor.
apparently Jinx has accepted the post of chief of marketing.
pestering the sister of the bride to plan a party and pick out shoes?
the nerve of those women. -I'd have to pick out shoes?
I was on the phone last night with my second cousin Marci.
she's a special agent with Minneapolis FBI.
now the way she hears it, on the down low... funny expression, down low...
the driver who killed Adam's wife was a no show for a scheduled Q & A.
so they hit his last-known address. The only thing left was the curtains.
there could be a thousand reasons the driver disappeared.
by which she means,"Thank you, Delia.
the conspiracy thickens. -It thins. The conspiracy thins.
the cops in Minneapolis ruled it accidental. The guy who caused it took off.
he probably had a laundry list of hit-and-runs. I mean, that's hardly unprecedented.
just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.
joseph Heller, Catch-22. - "Joseph Heller, Catch-22.
I'm just saying. - You're just saying,"Hey, look at me,
I got a gold star in lit." And not just in Shakespeare.
in the obscure, offbeat stuff too like On the Road and whatever that other thing was.
impressive how you can carry both sides of the conversation like that.
do you do puppet shows? -I hate puppet shows. So lame.
also oddly scary.
come on... - Get'im - Get it up...
good shot, Joey.
I'll be right back, all right?
nice shot. -Thanks.
I played some back in the day. We should shoot the rock sometime.
shoot the rock? Sorry.
someone's been watching reruns of The Wire.
take him up, bet big. He shoots like a girl.
and she fouls like an inmate playing ball in the yard for smokes.
I see you made some new friends. -Yeah, they're all right.
nothing like my guys in Minnesota, though, and Albuquerque definitely doesn't have girls like Jessica.
but whatever.
listen, we wanted to catch you when your dad wasn't around, talk to you about...
about his meltdown? That's f'd up, right?
the boarded-up windows were definitely unconventional.
he used to be, like, the best dad.
you know, street hockey on the weekends, and barbecues, and all that stuff.
and now all he talks about is what happened to my mom and how Mr. Bachmann's behind it.
most days, he never even leaves the house.
he doesn't even shower. -So you're taking care of him?
pretty much.
sounds fun.
I saw this thing about Larry Bird's mental game and how he'd always like to get in the other guy's head.
Mr. Bachmann is totally in my dad's head right now.
seems that way. -The thing is, what if he never leaves?
if what you say is true, that your wife was intentionally targeted, you must be considering your share of responsibility.
I know exactly who's responsible... Rand Bachmann.
if I could just get Joey to see that. He thinks I'm out of my mind.
well, some of your recent behavior could be seen as a little irregular.
the windows, for instance.
look, your son was forced to move away from his friends, from everything he knows.
that can't be easy on either of you.
he's all I have.
listen...
if he doesn't believe me...
I've been having a-a very hard time here.
look, Adam, you're under a tremendous amount of stress.
this is not atypical.
the good news is that there are ways to manage it.
I have a colleague, Dr. Sadoff... -No, no, no, no, no. No drugs.
they'll cloud my mind. I have testimony to give.
I have a murder to prove. I need to be thinking clearly.
I appreciate you, but I'm fine.
uh, I need to be home now.
Adam? You okay?
all right, listen up, wait for me right there.
lock the doors, no one comes in. I'm on my way.
they took Joey. Three guys in black hoods. They jumped out of the car.
was it the same car? The same license plate? - Yes! Yes! The same car!
Adam, did they say anything? I'm gonna put Stan on it.
no, they didn't say anything. -They just grabbed Joey.
Hey. - Joey, you okay?
did they hurt you? Are they still out there?
what's going on? - Adam, no. Adam! Adam! Adam!
stay away from my son, you son of a bitch!
hands up! Hands up! -U. S. marshals. Put your hands up!
let me see your hands! Let me see your hands!
you think I don't know who you are?? -- You think I don't know...!
dad! Dad, I was playing basketball! -Joey!! Joey, get back in the house!!
get back in the house! -Stand down. Stand down.
you tell Bachmann... -Yes, I have a medical emergency.
dad, calm down, all right?
so just like that, he's in the psychiatric unit?
how long?
it's hard to say.
but he's been sedated, so he's comfortable now, calm.
how about you? How are you doing?
look, Joey, I don't know exactly what you're going through here, but what I do know is it isn't your job to take care of your father.
he doesn't want it to be. You don't. Neither do I.
trust me, the best way for you to take care of him is just to take care of yourself.
do you know that he's been teaching me how to spot drone surveillance planes?
drones.
spot any?
I hate it here. My friends back home are getting ready to go to prom.
I'm about to visit my dad in a fricking psych ward.
I know. - And Jessica has some new boyfriend, I guess.
awesome. - Joey, listen to me, what I'm about to ask you is very important.
did you speak with Jessica? Someone else? How do you know that?
I trolled through Facebook on a friend's account.
okay? She's in a relationship with this guy Matthew Schmidt, my best friend since first grade.
nice. - Yeah.
God, just why did he have to go after Mr. Bachmann?
I met the guy. He was... I don't know, he was cool.
he got me a Nano for Christmas.
why couldn't he have just done his job?
for some people with a sense of duty, for your dad, he was doing his job.
if these episodes don't resolve quickly, we can always put him on a wide-spectrum antipsychotic, but then we'll have to be concerned about side effects.
now, listen, I'm on rounds. Call with anything. I don't sleep.
Thanks, Wayne. -Side effects?
drowsiness, muscle rigidity, tremors... difficult to predict.
I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure zombies tend to make less effective trial witnesses.
well, to this point, nothing that's happened would have to be revealed to the defense.
Adam's impact as a witness shouldn't be diminished.
Zeitlin will do handstands.
my concern is getting Adam straight with his son.
that'll go a long way toward putting him back on track, so whatever you can do.
protecting people I can do. Healing 'em's your gig.
in this case, you might not be able to do one without the other.
call you later.
dad.
you're in the hospital.
don't worry, okay? You're fine. I'm fine. You just...
you just got to breathe.
the doctors here are top-notch, Adam. You're in good hands.
what is he doing here? Get him out! Get him...
get him out of here! - Dad, what the hell?
they took you away in the Yukon last night.
he's a Genesis man.
you covered your face with that hood, but I know those eyes. You son of a bitch!
Adam, you know me. I'm Marshall. Mary and I are here to protect you.
he's with them. He's one of Bachmann's men. -No, Adam. No, he's not.
Marshall's with me, but he's going to find a nurse. - Yes, he is.
Mary, what the hell? This is getting worse.
it's getting worse. -Look at me.
look, your dad's getting help.
this is where he needs to be, but we need you to keep it together. Can you do that?
you're okay.
okay? - Gracie.
no. - Gracie.
Adam, I'm not your wife. - Oh, God.
Oh, my God. - Joey.
always been a stubborn boy. You talk to him. -Yeah, let me see what I can do, sweetheart, okay?
you just rest. - Where are you going, Joey?
Joey! Come back!
Joey, wait. -Damn it.
God damn it. Joey.
leave me alone. I'm going to the cafeteria. Is that not allowed?
look, I know what you saw in there just now...
my dad is completely whacked! - I know.
I know what this looks like right now, okay?
believe me, I do, but it doesn't mean your dad...
he's not gonna be like this forever. -How do you know?
you can't promise he'll get better, so don't.
Stan, he's a kid. He's in danger.
we can't at least reach out to WITSEC Minneapolis?
it's out of our hands, Marshall. Believe me.
I wish there was something we could do.
who died?
Joey Roston just officially opted out, and we assume he's on his way home.
well, so one of us watches the dad.
the other flies to Minnesota, drags him home by his ear.
it's a non-starter. Joey turned 18 last month.
he's entirely within his rights.
all we can do is protect the witness we do have.
so one witness goes section eight, and the other goes awol.
somehow I'm not seeing a departmental commendation on this one.
chief McQueen. - Yeah, what do you got?
DVD from WITSEC Washington. Special courier. Marked urgent.
hello. My name is Rand Bachmann, and I'm speaking to you from my office at the Genesis Corporation.
as I'm sure you're aware, it's been a tumultuous time for all of us here at Genesis.
and when I say all of us, I include our friend and former colleague Adam Wilson.
talk about connected.
Yeah, enough to get a DVD to us through DOJ Channels.
take that, Netflix.
so please know that what I'm about to share with you is meant in the spirit of true concern and understanding.
for some time now,
Adam's been struggling emotionally, making claims about his coworkers that bore no basis in fact.
even saying I made payments to a Senator...A total fabrication.
and while we don't pretend to understand what motivated him, please assure Adam that he is under no threat from anyone at Genesis.
and that no one was involved in Grace's death.
we... we join in his grief.
am I the only one a little creeped out that he was able to get this to us?
I assume he strong-armed a friend over at DOJ.
but one thing we never do is turn on our own people.
we're appealing to you because we know that reaching Adam personally is out of the question, as it should be.
but wherever Adam is and whatever he might be thinking of us, please assure him that he and Joey are close to our hearts and always in our thoughts.
thank you.
just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.
what? I read.
Yeah, I don't know, Stan. I guess I'll call you after I talk to him, okay?
okay.
okay. I cannot believe you brought backup.
what is this technique? The "Mommie Dearest"?
your sister tells me you've been avoiding the maid of honor question.
narc. - Mary, it's all my fault.
please tell me you didn't break my new coffee maker.
and I think I know what's really going on, why you won't say yes.
for so many years, you... both of you were so focused on me and my problems, you haven't had time to focus on each other.
mom. - To become real sisters.
what are you talking about? Of course, we're real sisters.
which is why I find you ambushing me in my own home irritating as opposed to, say, criminal.
Mary, please. I'm just trying to say that I think that my problem...
alcoholism? - Yes.
stopped you from growing up. - No, it didn't.
that graduation party you always wanted, that Sweet 16.
I never wanted a Sweet 16.
I wanted a bottle of vodka, which you bought for me.
I feel really bad about not being able to be there for you then, but I can be here for you now. And you can be here for Brandi.
Wow. - I know, right?
we've talked, Brandi and I, and if you don't want to be maid of honor, fine. But at least, as a sister, help her pick out her wedding gown.
dress. Let's start by calling it a dress, okay?
look, Brandi, I'm sorry you didn't get that sister.
you know, the Kodak moment sister who loves spending the day with wedding magazines.
I do my best. I'm just never gonna do magazines.
I don't do dresses. And I definitely don't do gowns.
but, hey, eat, drink. Not you.
and by all means, enjoy my couch.
Hey. Doctor said you're feeling better.
how's Joey?
Adam, we need to talk.
what?
what? Spit it out, inspector.
look, Joey's left the program. He's opted out of Witness Protection.
I don't understand. How?
he's 18 now. It's his call.
I guess, between everything that's happened and missing his old life, just too much.
where did he go? What are you doing about it?
well, right now what we're doing is upping your protection here at the hospital.
and as soon as you're released, you'll be relocated.
relocated? Joey would never compromise my location.
no. Not willingly, of course.
but he knows where you are. That makes him vulnerable. And not just him.
I need to talk to him. - Adam, that's not possible.
he's my son, God damn it.
okay. - He's just a boy, Mary.
he doesn't know how to protect himself.
do you know where he is? - No, we don't.
look, if I had to guess, the good money's on Minneapolis. Right?
he went to see Jessica.
what if Genesis has gotten to her?
no, Genesis hasn't... look, Jessica's not part of some scheme, Adam.
she's a high school kid. She's ditching class, buying a prom dress.
no, she is a girl whose father has debts.
it's so simple. It's straight out of Bachmann's playbook.
Adam. Adam, Adam! Just lie down, okay? Look.
please. Please. I've alerted the police in Minneapolis.
they'll keep an eye out for Joey if he shows.
all right? The best thing you can do now is rest up... Okay?
I'll check in with the Minneapolis PD, and I'll let you know what they know.
I promise. I promise. Okay?
okay.
okay.
wnba is calling.
new security detail's outside Adam's door waiting for us.
what's Finkel thinking?
that the key for Adam is getting straight with Joey.
so basically this guy's cure just went off the grid.
awesome, right?
listen, I'll handle the introductions, make sure Adam knows these guys are with us and not, you know, evil.
good idea. He and I aren't exactly Frick and Frack.
Oh, yeah. Plus, you say things like Frick and Frack, really, who needs that?
you guys noon to 8: 00? - yeah.
it's not that bad. It starts off with judge Judy, but not that one, the black one.
before you know it, you're into 11 hours of Law & Order reruns.
I'll see if Adam's up for handshakes.
Oh, crap.
Hey, Stan, Adam pulled a Cuckoo's Nest.
Yup. Looks like skipping town runs in the family.
guy can't tell me from his dead wife, but he Jackie Chans himself into the ventilation system and ditches security?
it's adrenaline. He's worried about his son.
Yeah, me too.
the day I left, I told you I loved you.
and you said the same thing. You said the same thing, Jessica.
I know. I...
look, things, they just...I never thought that I would see you again.
okay?
Hey, we're still gonna see each other at school, right?
you're still going?
I guess.
come on, Joey. Please don't.
I'm not. I'm not.
I'm just... my head is, like, allergies.
give me a minute? - Yeah.
everyone says New York's dangerous or Philly or Detroit.
but regardless of where you go, danger finds you.
the trick is, keep your head down, blend in, and go about your business.
you know what I mean?
give our regards to your father.
I'm telling you, Jessica didn't say a thing.
they must have been, I don't know, like, watching her I guess.
did either of them mention Genesis or Rand Bachmann?
they didn't have to. - Look, Joey, we can't tell you what to do. We can't force you back into the program, but those guys in the van were right about one thing.
it isn't safe for you here.
or your father.
what are you talking about?
we think your father's coming to look for you.
I thought he was in the hospital.
he was. He took off.
he heard you were coming back here, and however crazy you think he is, he's your father, and he wants you safe.
what are we gonna do? - Nothing.
you do nothing. You grab a crappy cup of coffee.
sit tight and do nothing.
Joey is telling extraordinary stories.
masked men, gagged in the back of a van, dumped outside a police station?
that's not public information.
Oh, relax. I don't have the precinct bugged. I spoke to the chief earlier.
huh, small world.
well, we were coordinating our weekly squash game.
clever, by the way, dropping Joey off outside the station.
just makes the kid's story sound ridiculous on its face.
do I sense a hidden accusation?
Oh, was that hidden? My mistake.
look, the last thing Genesis needs are additional headlines.
bring me a physical description, a license number, a single piece of evidence linking even one Genesis employee, and I'll conduct an internal investigation.
internal as in fabricated?
well, I hate to say this, but fabrication is Adam's department.
our file documenting Adam's many claims against Genesis as well as his psychological difficulties.
maybe all the secrecy required of his position got to him.
maybe I kept him on out of a sense of responsibility.
bottom line...Adam's a friend who lost his wife.
I'm concerned. We all are.
and I believe that you will see what I mean.
this file's a joke. It's a hell of a way to pre-impeach testimony.
bachmann sees someone about to blow the whistle, he retroactively assembles his own defense.
and Adam goes from whistleblower to psycho ex-employee with an axe to grind.
kind of genius, actually.
it's unbelievable.
Adam was dead-on about these guys from the get-go.
Ah, the dulcet sound of a Mary Shannon admission so rarely heard in nature.
do you think everyone wants to punch you in the mouth?
Joey? You okay?
okay, yeah. Okay, yeah, just stay put. We'll be there in ten.
Adam called Joey. Says he's gonna make things right.
Ooh, what do you think that means?
I don't know. The last place I'd want to be is inside Adam's head, but I'm guessing it doesn't involve a happy ending for Bachmann.
your father mentioned him by name?
no, but I could tell he was talking about Mr. Bachmann.
and then he said something about me being proud of him and hung up.
Adam's a trained soldier, so he'd want to exploit any weaknesses in Bachmann's personal security.
rules out Genesis headquarters. A special forces attack couldn't breach those walls.
then again, that Houdini act in the hospital?
I wouldn't put anything past him.
anybody want another cup of crappy coffee?
no.
the home compound's no picnic either.
so if you're thinking like him, thinking logistically, how does Adam get to Bachmann?
he waits, picks a spot with little or no security.
but these guys don't spend a lot of time out in the open.
you know, no running to the store for eggs.
and when they do go out, they're shielded by bouncers and bulletproof glass.
they golf, lunch at private clubs.
Yeah. Yeah. They play squash.
my dad and him used to play squash twice a week.
dad used to always bitch about always letting him win.
you know where? - Minnesota Athletic Club, St. Paul.
Yeah, hello, I'm with the Mobile Auto Detail?
Yeah, Mr. Bachmann's car's all done up, and we just wanted to know if now's a good time to drop it off.
Awff. - Awff.
no, no, no, don't interrupt his game.
Yeah, we'll just try back later.
you betcha. Bye now.
that's my best Fargo.
that was no one's best Fargo. - Come on.
if your dad's there, he's gonna need to see you.
but you'll stay in the car. - Got it.
we are gonna stay here all night, Rand, and you are gonna tell the story of what happened at Genesis, what really happened.
I don't know what you're talking about.
into the camera. Into it. Right now.
I swear to God. I swear to God, Rand.
you're asking me to admit to things that never actually happened.
no, no. No, no, no.
don't. I came to you with concerns.
when I persisted, you had them buried, eliminated, along with me.
and then you tried to kill me.
you killed Grace instead. You killed my wife, you son of a bitch.
you're pointing a gun at me, Adam.
anything I say here is not admissible at trial.
who said anything about a trial?
get back! - Adam!
get back! - Okay, okay.
what is this?
think! There's no endgame here.
I want Joey to know what really happened to his mother.
I want him to know that I...had know that this is real!
this happened! - Okay.
I believe you, dad. - Joey.
not helping, Joey. - Don't move.
I believe you, dad. I believe you.
dad, please. Please. Just... I believe you.
Adam. I think you and Joey lost enough. Huh?
doing this, this won't bring Grace back.
your... your son is here, and he believes you.
you got what you wanted.
he believes you.
your son needs you. Huh?
okay. Okay.
one of my earliest memories was of a beachfront and a flagpole.
and of lightning flashes headed for the shore.
as grow-ups ran around frantic, gathering beach towels, flip-flops an five-year olds, one kid in particular went racing to the storm.
so you're telling me there's no need for me to testify at all?
that part of things, that's over now.
the A. U.S. A. felt the squash court imbroglio might impugn your credibility.
so that's it? The case against Genesis is just what?
Zeitlin can't move forward without you.
Bachmann's agreement not to prosecute for assault with a deadly weapon was the best we could do.
okay. Let's go home, Joey.
wait a second, Adam.
are you sure about this? You want to opt out?
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm positive.
your agreement with DOJ remains in full effect.
we protect you as long as you want, Adam.
my information about corruption at Genesis doesn't matter anymore.
it's irrelevant. I'm a nuisance to them.
harming us is no longer in their interest.
good luck. Both of you.
thank you, Mary.
appreciate it, Marshall.
Hey, Joey.
take care of yourself.
let's go, Bud.
I watched that five-year old at the beachfront, clinging, wide-eyed to the flagpole.
as pretty bolts of lightning lit the sky.
then his mom ran out. Or a lifeguard, or an aunt.
and pulled him down to groundedness to live another day.
right, Delia.
Yep.
minneapolis cops found the remains of the guy who hit Grace Wilson's car.
let me guess. Bottom of a quarry.
abandoned warehouse just outside downtown.
they're calling it a suicide.
search for truth just ran out of road.
Bachmann's prints won't be within miles.
so Adam looked good. Didn't think you were his dead wife.
Yeah, just the right meds and two weeks in a psych ward, he's as good as new.
as good as something anyway.
no chance he's gonna pick up a gun and go after Bachmann again?
logistically, he wouldn't risk losing Joey.
his son's the only thing left in his life that matters.
Plus, I told him if Bachmann turns up with as much as a skinned knee,
I'd hunt him down like a filthy dog.
but, you know, my usual light touch.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
okay, here's the thing.
I'm thinking you just keep it simple. Nothing too Lady Gaga.
how about this?
Mary. It's beautiful.
wow, Mary.
as with most things, hanging on to flagpoles is, in the end, a matter of balance.
they're good to keep you steady while you stay alert for lightning as the storms cross the sea.
bulldog 1, this is Bulldog 7
we are two clicks out from target.
area looks clear, over.
Roger Bulldog 7, we are Oscar Mike behind you, over.
copy that, Bulldog 1.
see you on the other side. Bulldog 7 out.
dumbasses will probably get lost.
we'll have to take out Haji all by our lonesome.
that's hella profound.
all right, let's move out.
Christ.
Sarge, are we seeing this?
give me the binos.
no problem, Major Filk.
always good doing business with you, Kabir.
son of a...
it's major Filk and captain Barnes.
tell your boys to be careful with the Claymores.
I'd hate to have to deal with a bunch of new faces.
let's go.
two weeks ago they're bitch-slapping non-coms over gut-busters and widow-makers gone missing.
guess we know where they went missing to.
hell do we do now? - Our job.
soon as Haji clears out, we get to the target.
what about Filk and Barnes?
one enemy at a time, Loverro.
get down, get down!
get out!
stay low.
the summer after first grade, my neighbor taught me how swim.
Mrs. Duane, on dry land, was a sumo-sized single mom and CPA.
but five feet from the edge of the shallow end, she was my own personal safe harbor.
holding out her stay-puft marshmallow arms, she'd say,"close your eyes, count to five, take a breath, and jump.
what came next was a frantic mix of kicking and gulping and bubbles and gasps.
slowly, but somewhat surely,
I made it through my turquoise-colored panic and into her waiting arms.
not because I wasn't scared.
because she wasn't.
days like this, it's all worth it.
well, it's always worth it. But days like this...
what, God? What's worth it?
the job, the slog.
con men and turncoats. The low-level grunt.
guy sees his superiors selling arms to the enemies.
coulda looked the other way.
Oh, like you with me stealing pens from the supply closet?
instead he stands up, turns in the guys on the other side of the salute.
what's he get in return? Death threats.
his career is shot to hell. And a one-way ticket to WITSEC.
it's better than Fallujah. - "It's better than Fallujah.
that's our new bumper sticker, right?
it's either that, or "WITSEC.
it's not just for mobsters anymore.
he's a bona fide hero, people.
a little less at ease, a little more attention.
Oh, boy.
u. S. Army Special Forces, three tours in Iraq, Afghanistan.
multiple commendations for bravery.
distinguished Service Cross.
my husband doesn't feel he's worthy-- - Sue...
sergeant Loverro is in a coma on life support, ma'am.
chest candy's pointless if the rescue's not successful.
I wouldn't say that.
the criteria for the cross is based on actions, not outcome, and your actions in saving sergeant Loverro meet that criteria and then some.
as you were. - Thank you, sir.
wish I could get our other witnesses to do that.
Stan, does your friend have a name?
Marshall, Mary, this is
major Lucas Provo, JAG attorney for Sergeant Shears.
inspector Shannon. - Inspector Mann. Welcome aboard.
okay, so...
so I see everyone's settled. Everyone good?
good.
this is to make official that you will be honorably discharged from the U. S. Army.
as such, you are entitled to receive any and all benefits due you.
thank you, sir. - And the army is coordinating with DOJ to get your entitlements set up, yes?
Oh, yes, sir. We are, sir.
Yes, just, uh, plain yes.
smooth.
good. Now...
once we get you and Mrs. Shears in suitable quarters, - the next order of business will be-- - Listen, Mr. Provo
major Provo.
sorry. Major Provo.
I have no doubt that you're good at your job, and even less doubt that we're good at ours.
and protecting Mr. Stills-- not Sergeant Shears-- that's ours.
Hey, you okay?
I just felt much safer on the base.
sue, the army doesn't have its own Witness Protection.
and I promise you, we're pretty darn good at this.
so if you follow a few simple rules, safety won't be an issue.
and if there's anything you need, you can contact us day or night.
I'll be taking the lead on your case.
for the record, it was sort of my turn to take the lead. But I've got a
well, a bit of a... situation here.
let's just say you're not the only one who has to follow a few simple rules.
now, once we get you settled in
inspectors, as much as your input is appreciated, military protects military.
on this operation, I'm running point.
major, I'm-- I'm no lawyer, but I've got a pretty good handle on matters of jurisdiction.
Stan, back me up here.
well, actually...
no, not the "actually" face.
not my favorite face. - Yeah, well.
I went back and forth with DOJ.
but bottom line, the army's going to run this.
with our input, of course.
our input? What a crock of
we all have a chain of command, Mary.
I've formulated a detailed plan for the witnesses' security.
it's all outlined in here. - Wait, wait, wait.
so it's all in there?
easy. - Oh, that's great.
and I'm sure your plan that's all in there is perfect in theory, Major, but theory goes out the window in Witness Protection.
it can get pretty messy. - Inspector Shannon.
I assure you, I have spent plenty of time with messy.
and in my world, theory goes out the window every day.
he doesn't get it. Okay, look-- - Just stop.
everybody stop.
you're talking about it like we're not even here, like it's nothing.
our lives are gone.
in the Army, we were safe.
at least I-I thought we were.
my husband can't do this. I can't do this.
Hey, hey. John.
let us. Go on. Take the lead.
Whoo.
messy, right?
I'm just curious, what's your big book of plans say we do when the wife runs crying out of the room?
since 1970, the Federal Witness Protection Program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods se individuals shares a unique attribute distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is, somebody wants them dead.
I had hoped that Sue would be the least of our worries.
army wives are used to starting over, dealing with new environments, the quick assimilation.
right, but she's not an army wife anymore.
this isn't just hopping from base to base.
I get that. - Do you?
my mom was an army wife for 30 years.
she's now a full Professor at Johns Hopkins.
life beyond the base, it can work.
any suggestions how, major? - What are you asking him for?
he's the problem, not the solution.
how do you figure? - You work for the people John's testifying against.
your D. C. office is a huge potential security leak, and "potential" is being kind.
there's no conflict of interest here.
the JAG Corps prosecutes criminals, period, just like DOJ.
right, criminals who draw paychecks from the same company you do.
we get paid by the U. S. government. So do you.
all right, people. Let's stay on point.
look, we are fast-tracking this case with the full support of the Army and Congress.
the accused, meanwhile, are in the stockade awaiting court-martial.
you think those guys don't have any reach?
the stockade doesn't have any phones?
I don't disagree with you.
there are many links in the chain of command.
and that includes a small handful of trained operatives who are out there, literally right this second, actively looking for John.
so if you want to keep him upright, I suggest you get on board.
Oh, on board? Gosh, why didn't you say so?
he just wants me to get on board.
okay, you two. Cease fire.
Mary, you and Marshall are going to work with the Major.
get John and Sue settled. - Oh, great.
thank you, Chief McQueen. - You're welcome.
our office is here to help in any way we can.
and hey, uh, call me Stan.
Stan. - Yeah.
Oh, my God.
call me Stan.
what? - Oh, no. I get it.
it's cool. A little uniform envy.
that's nothing to be ashamed of--it's kinda sweet.
look, you're all a-twitter.
you're like an eight-year-old girl with a new Shaun Cassidy poster.
Mary, we just-- don't start, all right?
the man deserves a little respect.
of course he does. Just, you know.
try not to salute.
stupid.
seriously, Provo puts the "jag" in "jagoff.
I have something that'll take you from your current level of disgust back down to your usual state of garden-variety grumpiness.
is it a legal document promising you'll never say "garden-variety grumpiness" again?
two free tickets to an isotopes game.
what gives?
you live for minor league baseball.
Abigail booked us on ghost walk the same night.
ghost walk. Lame.
the woman loves a haunted house.
Yeah, haunted house, ghost stories. Yay!
it's a slumber party. What's next, pillow fight and a ouija board?
easy. - Just sayin'.
you bailing on baseball?
that's a big "c" compromise.
you mean sacrifice.
compromise, in the romantic sense, entails inaction and potential loss, whereas sacrifice
Yeah, stopped listening at "two free tickets.
the realtor lists the building as southwest contemporary, but I'd say it hails more from the prairie school.
Ah, I was just gonna say that. The prairie school.
so true.
won't do. Not secure enough.
Hey, Marshall, I've got an ideal.
why don't you bore our friends with your version of the nickel tour?
I'd love to have a word with Uncle Sam.
let me show you this landscape integration.
if you'll step back here...
we're trying to get these people settled. You know, calm.
and the wife-- she's not calm.
she's about two minutes away from guys in white suits with butterfly nets.
and those fishbowl windows may as well have a sign saying "welcome, snipers.
an interior unit on the middle floor would be optimal.
Yeah, fine, if there were a direct threat.
but we have our witnesses secured in a safe city that only a handful of people know about, two of them us and none of them snipers.
so trust me, unless someone's calling an ex or using an old credit card, this is as optimal as it gets.
you see a skylight, right?
you know what I see?
Oh, boy. I have a feeling I'm about to.
two rangers hovering in a whisper-silent 500p helicopter.
they rappel down and breach this place in 30 seconds flat, and extract John before Sue can say "one Mississippi.
look, I know we're just army, but we do top secret pretty well too.
Really? Wikileaks says hi.
seal team six and Osama Bin Laden tells a slightly different story.
look, inspector.
I really want us to work together on this.
so when I tell you John's not safe here, it's not hyperbole.
he's not safe here.
what do you mean, we're not safe?
sue, that's not what he meant.
I thought the whole point of coming into this program was to keep us safe.
of course it is, and you are.
sue, hey. Listen to me.
no witness in the history of WITSEC has ever been harmed when they stuck with the program.
major Provo, he's just being a little extra cautious.
trust me.
look, do me a favor.
find John, we'll load up, and we'll go see those other places, okay?
great idea. Come on.
unbelievable.
you win every argument with your boyfriend, don't you?
Wow.
the practiced casual boyfriend drop-in.
gotta say, I was kind of expecting more.
and for the record, I prefer "condom-ly challenged ex-douchebag.
so he's-- - Awol, at my request.
Hey, by the way, back there with Sue, bang-up job with the top secret.
you guys give lessons?
what Major Provo said...
do you think we're really in danger?
I asked you a question, John. - I'm trying to watch TV.
and I'm trying to talk to you. - Oh, Jesus.
not again, okay? Not again.
get your rank posterior off my spot.
first me, now Oscar.
at this rate, you'll need an extension for the bed.
I like it. It's homey.
Oh, man.
sue, everything okay?
I can't hold him off, Marshall!
open the door, now! - Please!
open the goddamn door!
sue, I need you to get to a safe place.
lock yourself in any room.
I'm in the bathroom. Help me, please!
sue, listen to me.
call 911. We'll be right there.
sue? Sue? - I'm coming with you.
Mary, get Provo. It's Sue.
open the door, now!
damn it, open the goddamn door!
open the door!
move away from the door!
move away from the door! - Open the goddamn door!
John, that's enough.
they'll kill you if you don't let me in.
they'll kill you if you don't open the door now!
Ow...
Albuquerque PD-- - They'll kill us!
easy... - They're gonna kill us!
easy, easy. - No.
No! Get off of me. - Easy.
has he ever hit you? - Never.
not once. And he didn't hit me.
it's not what you think.
sue, have you ever seen a movie of the week?
if he was violent with you once, trust me, he'll do it again.
she's right. He will.
but this isn't about domestic violence.
Really? 'Cause it looks just like it.
from what Marshall said, this is a clear case of PTSD.
PTSD's a diagnosis, Provo. That's the why.
right now, I care about the what.
and if you think the what isn't domestic violence
I-I need to be with my husband.
John was in a dissociative state, triggered, at least initially, by the movie blasting on TV.
all quiet on the Western front.
couple that with the stress of Sue pushing on Afghanistan, it's not unreasonable to think that that's why he snapped.
Marshall, when you got here,
John was yelling "they will kill you," right?
they, not "I." - Yeah,"they." Right.
so?
well, according to Sue, he's been battling insomnia.
emotional detachment, disproportionate outbursts of anger.
guess what those are symptoms of.
pregnancy?
who made you the spokesman for post-traumatic stress?
2, 000 Iraqis.
at one point during Desert Storm, my unit engaged the Republican Guard for four days of sustained combat.
I watched thousands of them die.
literally thousands of Iraqis.
in four days.
Jesus. - That's gotta take its toll.
you have no idea.
I got lucky. I got help.
now I volunteer at Walter Reed, talking to soldiers with PTSD.
okay, so he's got PTSD.
he's still dangerous. So now what?
you tell me.
I'm just riding shotgun on this one.
inspector?
we work the program.
find them jobs and a place to live.
and we get him help.
well, I'll say this. We've never had so much room.
don't you think, John?
look, I'm gonna go out for a smoke, all right?
he never smoked until Afghanistan.
everyone there, and Iraq, they all did.
just as a time-killing thing.
listen, about last night...
is everything in Albuquerque so brown or white?
living on base,
I saw so many soldiers come home with it.
I saw what it did to their marriages.
and their families.
I knew it was possible, maybe likely, but I just...
closed my eyes and prayed that it wouldn't happen to John.
that it wouldn't happen to us.
I just want my husband back.
we're gonna do everything we can to get John the help he needs.
you would have liked him, Marshall.
before. He--he was funny.
and charming as anything.
everyone just loved to be even just around him.
you know?
interior's secure.
this place'll do.
this feel okay to you, Sue?
good as any. - Excellent.
let's spread the word.
good news, John.
welcome home.
listen, uh, John.
with everything that's happened, you know, it might help to sit with it. You know, talk it out.
these guys have worked with a therapist for years-- - Oh, no.
I'm good. I was just overtired last night.
you know, been through a lot lately.
everything's fine. Right, honey?
right.
sue, I think that-- - I got it.
can I talk to you two a minute?
they're all yours.
fine"?
that guy's no one's version of fine. - Yeah, I know.
I've seen too many defense lawyers manipulate a witness with PTSD into ripping his own credibility to shreds.
right now I'm a little more concerned with him ripping his wife to shreds.
Yeah, me too.
look, if this case goes away, a pair of traitors walk, and John's blown up his life and career for what?
you think he and Sue are a mess now...
honestly?
all I'm thinking now is how I could eat my body weight in blue corn enchiladas, soft beef tacos, and...
I'm gonna say a side of Sauerkraut?
sure, who doesn't enjoy Mexican with a side of Sauerkraut?
Oh, look.
Papas fritas con chile. - Thank you. Good.
soft beef tacos, and a blue corn enchilada.
cool, thanks. - You'll survive without the Sauerkraut?
Yeah, you know.
cravings. Sometimes, you just gotta show 'em who's boss.
snooze on this, I'll put it all away myself.
seriously, I didn't line my pockets with tinfoil for nothing.
you know what? This is, uh...
this is nice.
yeah? You should get out more.
I'm just happy to have a beer and someone to sit with.
I've been eating solo at P. F. Chang's all week.
so... John and Sue.
am I gonna have to separate those two, or what?
I'm not sure.
you know, we train soldiers to tamp down their feelings, so the fact that he's not keen on sitting down with a shrink is hardly surprising.
can't expect him to do a 180 and open up just 'cause it'd be more convenient.
you know, maybe you oughta flip through that big book of plans.
there's gotta be something in there, no?
you gonna let that go anytime soon?
define "soon.
you haven't asked me how I knew.
so we're speaking in code now, or...
how I knew you weren't married.
you know, the casual "boyfriend" drop-in.
figured you didn't see a ring, you put two and two together.
how about you?
how's that happen? - How's what happen?
decorated war hero turned JAG lawyer, spends his free time volunteering with wounded vets? Come on.
there's no Mrs. A few good men?
there's gotta be a serious flaw in there somewhere.
uh, well, um...
I could never hit the curveball.
c'est la vie. - Ah, there it is.
c'est la vie is the flaw?
hate it. Hate it so much.
can I be blunt? - Not sure you can't be.
you can knock off the lonely bachelor eating solo B. S.
Albuquerque's endless supply of dopey hot co-eds, and you skulking around in your crisp class "A"s? Please.
fish in a barrel have a better shot.
first of all, I rarely skulk.
answer the question. - You didn't ask one.
it was implied.
I'm holding out.
that's all you have to say?
not all.
how's the rest go?
I'm holding out for something more.
for something more, you know? Smarter, messier, just...
just more. - Funny.
I'm holding out for someone who doesn't bug the crap out of me.
well, I'm guessing that significantly drains the pool.
you have no idea.
I have some idea. - Do you?
I do.
you gonna be okay with this?
I'd be a lot more okay if DOJ had let me call in my guy.
we need an expert, not just on PTSD.
ptsd for vets.
you know this situation's unique.
bringing in an outsider's not doable.
look, military PTSD isn't my specialty.
Provo probably knows more about it than I do. So fine.
they want to coax this guy into staring down his demons, give it a whirl.
this is all routine, but I thought it'd be good for us to jump into our prep.
iron out the kinks before we get in front of a judge.
Yes, sir.
I asked inspector Mann to stand in as opposing counsel
good for you?
okay, John, just so you know, my girlfriend got me a Law & Order box set for my birthday.
fair warning.
you ready? - Yeah.
we appreciate your being here today, sergeant, because you, more than anyone, can shed light on what happened in the Korengal valley.
Yes, sir. - Only answer if the defense asks you a question, John, okay?
okay. I'm sorry, sir.
so...
let's go back to the events of that day.
you were on a forward scout with Sergeant Loretto
Loverro, sir.
right, sorry. Sergeant Loverro.
you two were on a forward scouting mission.
that's correct, sir. - Questions only, sergeant.
understood? - Right. Sorry, sir.
what did you see?
I saw major Filk and captain Barnes selling weapons to the Taliban, sir.
allegedly selling, but we'll get to that.
what happened next?
we were dug in behind some rocks
you and Mark? - Me and Mike.
we were dug in, waiting for the field to clear before we pushed on.
and my team fired an AT-4 at Haji.
and all hell broke loose.
get down, get down!
define "all hell.
well, the enemy returned fire, sir.
me and Mike were caught in the cross.
you and, uh, Sergeant Lawrence.
sergeant Loverro. His name's Mike Loverro, sir.
okay, you and Loverro were caught in the crossfire.
what happened then?
we made a run for it.
stay low!
Mike got hit.
how did you know he was down?
you were in the lead, isn't that what you said?
did you see him get shot?
how did you know he hadn't just tripped?
stay low!
was he shot before or after you went back for him?
Mike, wait!
did you see the shot?
Mike! - No, I
Yes, I did, sir.
which is it, sergeant? Was he shot before you got there or not?
look, I carried him to safety.
sergeant Shears, when was sergeant Lombard shot?
look, his name's sergeant Loverro, God damn it.
sergeant Michael Loverro.
and I killed him.
go ahead.
during the firefight...
I didn't go first.
Mike did.
I, uh...
I-I gave him the wrong hand signal.
he jumped out before I could stop him.
he took the bullet that was meant for me.
you don't know that. - I was lead recon.
Mike was my responsibility.
I go first.
things get ass-ended in battle.
you go on instinct. You do your best.
John, you saved your friend.
no. If I had gone first,
Mike would be fine. He wouldn't be in a goddamn coma.
you had no way of knowing Loverro would get shot.
in the face of that, you-- you rescued him.
you carried him on your back to safety.
you risked your life to save that of a fellow soldier.
you don't think that's what a hero does?
I'm not. I'm not.
listen, John, everything you're going through, it comes with the territory.
I know.
you're gonna come out of it.
yeah?
where?
good question.
the next stop on Ghost Walk is the Renfro mansion, built in 1890 by then-territorial governor Charles Renfro.
he sold it to James Madsen, a U. S. marshal, who used the basement as a jail.
did I tell you? A ghost story about a marshal.
perfect, right?
a home run.
Oh! Oscar!
Oscar? Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness. Is that my little Oscar-puss?
Brandi. - Hey.
sorry about that. He's still learning the leash.
so is she. - Oh, yeah, that's okay
he's just excited to see auntie "bwandi," aren't you?
Yes, you are. - I'm Peter, Brandi's fiance. Have we met?
uh, yeah. She kind of arrested me.
that's right. Family dinner.
got it. Yeah, that was fun.
just doing my job.
so Ghost Walk.
which one of you is the haunted house aficionado?
guilty. Can't get enough of 'em.
since I was a kid.
can you believe I'm marrying this?
Oh, hey, are you guys coming to the wedding?
I didn't know I was invited.
don't tell me you got another plus-one on the side.
my invitation did not include a plus-one.
well, it does now.
okay. Well, I would love to.
now, I promise, I'll leave the cuffs at home.
please. - Hey, we should catch up.
they're almost at the Renfro mansion.
if you think I'm gonna miss that basement...
okay, the sad part is, he's actually totally serious.
but it was really good bumping into you guys.
we'll see you at the wedding. - Can't wait!
let's move in together.
you, me, and Oscar.
okay. I'll give notice tomorrow.
I'm serious. - So am I.
it's not too soon?
Marshall, he's a dog.
he'll adjust.
your pants are vibrating.
this is Chaffee.
on my way.
I'm first in, got it?
Thanks. Sorry. I gotta
go. I know the drill.
I like the drill. You wear it well.
is everything okay? - Everything's fine.
my evening just opened up unexpectedly.
I thought I'd stop by and see how you and John are doing.
what? Isn't he with you and Mary?
did he say he was? - Yes.
he came home for a quick bite around 6: 00, and then left again, said he was going to talk to you about job prospects.
no, we haven't seen him all night.
was he acting strangely in any way?
say anything out of the ordinary?
no, no. No--no more than lately.
Oh, my God.
voicemail.
Marshall, it's gone.
what's gone? - The gun.
what gun? - The gun! The one he said you gave him.
sue, we didn't give him a gun.
please, please, please.
whatever you have to do, just bring him home.
I called Mary. She's on her way.
I know. I got her. Okay, great, thanks.
E. S.U. Located John's rental heading north on the 25, just this side of Raton Pass.
he's going to Colorado Springs. - You sound pretty sure.
been keeping track of Loverro's progress, thinking I might be able to add him as a witness.
you think John went to see him?
manner of speaking. Loverro died three days ago.
his funeral's tomorrow morning. Guess where.
great, a guy with a Mountain of guilt on his head and a gun in his hand.
there's gonna be military there, everywhere he looks.
that's a lot of targets for a loose cannon.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
sue, look at me. Look. Here. Come here.
what I need you to do right now is sit still and stay calm.
we're gonna handle this, understand?
you thinking what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking there are not a lot of commercial flights out of sunport this time of night.
Hey, Stan, sorry to get you at home. We need a plane.
Marshall, time. - Funeral's in ten.
damn it, which way?
Marshall, use the nav. Punch in the address.
hit "fastest route.
what's the nav say? How long?
nine minutes. Turn right. - Go, go, go.
then shall the dust return to the earth, from whence it came.
and the spirit...
peace will be with your soul...
I don't see him.
pull forward.
behind that tree.
Hey, I don't know what you told Stan to get him to say yes, but you getting in harm's way?
I'm saying no. Stay here.
aim.
fire.
aim. Fire.
aim. Fire.
I'll get in front of him.
you flank. - Okay.
John. Hey.
what are you doing, John?
think, soldier.
I just...
come on.
I just...
I wanted to apologize to Mike's wife.
no, no, no, no. Drop it, John. Come on.
no, no, no, no, no.
come on, John.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
for everything.
will you please tell Sue?
just slow down, soldier.
think about what you're doing.
that's one of your men over there--that's Mike Loverro.
you don't want to mess up his funeral, buddy.
come on. Right?
you wanna apologize to his wife?
honor his memory? Start now.
think about his family, John. Think about yours.
John, damn it. You did nothing wrong.
you did nothing wrong.
Loverro was a hero who died for his country, gladly.
he knew it when he signed on the line.
look, you don't understand.
six months of night sweats and a heart attack every time a car backfires.
you think I don't understand?
come on, John.
I know the world of hurt you're in right now.
not the exact coordinates, but I'm familiar with the landscape.
look at me, John.
look at me.
I can help you.
but you gotta put the gun down first, buddy. Come on, come on.
it's okay.
it's all right, buddy.
it's okay.
it's okay.
it's okay.
it's okay.
it's okay. It's okay, John.
everything's gonna be okay.
I wasn't gonna hurt anybody.
I just...
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
so...
so look. I'm gonna stay here with John.
clean up this mess. - Great.
okay.
see ya.
see ya.
listen.
you know that thing I said before about you being the problem and not the solution...
that's all you have to say?
not all.
how does the rest go?
it was implied.
Hey. What's up?
I just wanted to make sure that you knew
I invited Abigail to the wedding.
Abigail. - Yeah.
Marshall's Abigail? - Yeah.
you know she arrested you, right?
she was just doing her job.
God, you're like a shark. You only move forward.
anyway, we ran into them at Ghost Walk the other night.
she's really nice. They're a really adorable couple.
Oh, adorable.
they're a pail full of kittens.
you kidding me?
it's a mid-life crisis with a badge.
they'll probably be broken up by the time the wedding rolls around.
but seat 'em next to each other. It'd be fun to watch 'em squirm.
Oh, I don't know, the vibe that I got
that's what they said about Joanie and Chachi.
how'd that turn out?
Hey, I gotta go. I'll call you later, okay?
Bye.
Mary. - Hi.
Hi.
uh, I forgot you were coming.
Oh, now, I forgot to tell you.
so we're even. - Do you want to come in?
uh, actually, I can't. I can't stay.
I just wanted to drop something off.
Oh, well, John's resting now.
actually, it's... it's for you.
I just--I thought it couldn't hurt.
well, what John's been through and what I'm going through, they don't really compare.
well, they don't have to. It's not a contest.
look, Sue, you've been through a lot too.
you've lost a lot. A life. Family, friends.
I just know it's going to be tempting to reach out to that old base of support.
don't. If you need to reach out, reach out to me, okay?
okay. Thank you. - Sure.
take care. - Bye.
okay, great. Thanks.
Yeah. Bye, Luke.
well, Provo got into it with Colorado Springs P. D.
they're gonna look the other way on the funeral incident, concealed weapons charge.
so John's still on track to testify.
good. - Yeah.
good. So...
Luke" now. Interesting.
what's interesting? It's his name.
you two went to lunch?
I had to eat. He was there. Whatever.
you make it sound so romantic.
romantic? Marshall. Look at me.
Babar's sexier than I am.
pregnant women are only less attractive to men who have never consummated with one.
Oh. What? - No. I mean, it wasn't my baby.
Blech, Marshall. Gross.
look, if you're into that stuff, find a website.
no, it's complicated. I was in college
okay, you need to stop talking now.
what is all this?
what, you got a mope angling for new digs?
uh, it's, uh... It's not for a witness.
it's for me.
for me and Abigail, actually.
you and Abigail.
interesting.
so who's renting the u-haul?
still sorting that out.
we've both gotten pretty set in our ways.
Yeah, well...
how set in her ways could a 12-year-old get, right?
point is, my place doesn't feel right to her, her place doesn't feel right to me.
that's odd. I mean,
Abigail's so neat and girly, and you're so neat and girly.
well, you know what I think.
it's not a sign that we shouldn't move in together.
it's a--a glitch.
a glitch. - A bump.
a bump. Huh.
here you go.
how about this place? The prairie-style one.
it's perfect.
ask any aquaphobic six-year-old.
there are benefits to staying out of the pool.
you get to mock the nose plug and the kickboards, eat ice cream without watching the clock for 30 minutes after.
and the dry itch aftermath, the bleachy stench of chlorine is someone else's cross to bear.
but sitting poolside as others splash around can tempt even the most timid.
if you're feeling brave, you close your eyes, ount to five, take a breath, and jump.
and you hope that someone stronger, more currently reliable
your own sumo-sized CPA will be there to pull through the kicks and the gulps, the bubbles and the gasps.
you always work this late?
well, my current condition tends to limit my dance card.
anyway, between a backlog of these after-action reports and these marshal service pregnancy forms,
I'm doing paperwork for two.
well, how about dinner instead? Also for two.
you can't believe these forms.
that eager to get rid of me, huh?
Hey, you know those, uh, little berets you guys wear?
you got any extra?
I gotta do something about Stan's uniform envy-- He'd love it.
we'd really love it.
answer the question.
you didn't ask one. - Yeah, I did.
Wow. Your timing's crap.
same reason I could never hit the curveball.
Oh, really? - Yep. One dinner.
I'm on a hop back to D. C. in the morning.
it's just dinner.
you'll get me the little beret?
so that's a yes?
it was implied.
pledges, tonight you take your first steps towards a proud and centuries-old legacy.
you have passed the rigorous tests of worthiness to a calling
a brotherhood.
but now these tests and games give way to declaration.
two presidents, seven current and former senators, one secretary of state, and one supreme court justice have all stood where you stand.
to the next generation of Winston regents.
prepare to be tapped, gentlemen.
hack room. Now.
what are we doing here? I want my pin.
I'm not gonna code right now.
I ran your numbers. - You're webmaster, that's your job.
and your job was to help me run our site, not skim the profits.
Henry, come on, man. I have proof.
you faked your data.
and you found a pattern?
dude, you train-wrecked. big.
Mr. Gunter, Mr. Cook, follow me, gentlemen.
welcome to the regents, mr. Gunter.
now, if you would, Mr. Cook and I need a moment alone.
Henry, regents are men of loyalty.
look, whatever Ivan told you is - Mr. Gunter didn't tell me a thing.
loyalty means something to Mr. Gunter, but you, Mr. Cook?
you. Skimming.
you honestly thought we wouldn't find out?
help! It's Henry!
help! Help! Somebody help me, Henry fell off the roof!
call 911! Somebody call 911!
I'm worried about Ivan, of course I am, he's my son.
but leaving now is impossible.
my work-it's not- It has the potential to save millions of lives.
professor Gunter, you need to realize staying at Winston could cost you yours.
I understand the risk, but I am days away from getting approval on my nih grant.
if we could just delay
we strongly advise against any delay.
professor, we appreciate how vital your research is, we do, but your son has agreed to testify, not only to the homicide charges, but also to the online gambling site being run by the regents.
what chief McQueen is trying to impress upon you is that, unfair and inconvenient as it may be, you're a target.
mom, come on. These people, they're dangerous and connected.
Ivan, I love you more than anything, you know that.
I can't leave yet.
you know I can't.
there's a phenomenon some people experience, those who've lost an arm or a leg, called "phantom limb."
they feel pain, heat, cold, even movement, despite the fact that, strictly and scientifically speaking, there is no "there" there.
it's as if the body can't accept that something so essential so natural a part has moved on.
the memory of what had been there so strong that even in its clear and sudden absence, the connection cannot be denied.
mom? Mark? Who took this safety latch off?
all the cabinets in the kitchen have a safety latch on them.
how was I supposed to get to the baby food?
honey, Norah can't even walk yet.
not on those chubby widdle weggies, no you can't.
no, she can't, not yet, but when she can, we'll be ready, and we've talked about this.
ix-nay on the baby-talk, okay? Let's aim high.
Yeah, pig-latin high.
here's the schedule, okay? Listen up. 10: 15, spinach and peaches.
well, maybe not the peaches I may have eaten the peaches But definitely the spinach.
11: 10's nap time. Left side, no pillows.
12: 30's wakeup.
you have the monitor. If you hear even the slightest peep, just go in.
honey, I know you're nervous, but we're gonna be fine.
mark's apartment is just down the street.
and I'm working close by, so I'm just ten minutes away.
Norah's fine. See how happy she is?
Oh, aren't you happy with gwamma?
Ugh, please. - Are you?
please just pronounce the "r."
all right, I'm gonna check in. A lot.
a lot a lot, and I don't care if miami falls off the map, no two-hour skype sessions with Brandi, okay? Just focus.
don't worry. Day-trading with scott has Brandi so busy she can't even return a phone call.
unreal. Runaway bride steals my car - and lands on her feet with nothing but blonde hair, big boobs. - Mary.
and a half-brother who I'm pretty sure still owes her that 10 grand he "borrowed."
she's doing great. You should be proud of her, of both of them.
I'd be bursting with pride if I weren't bracing myself with skepticism.
love you, bug.
say bye-bye to mommy! Can you say,"bye-bye, mommy"?
no,'cause she can't speak!
Bye-bye, mommy.
I know, I know, it's a mini-van, but it's got like, a thousand airbags and twice as many cup holders.
anyway, I'm just test driving it for a few days.
well, it's not the car. It's, uh. You're early.
Yeah, I'm a day early. So what?
I thought I'd come in, get organized, see what cases are up, you know.
God, It's good to be back. I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.
what? - Uh, you got a little something.
okay.
Oh, my god.
Mary! You weren't supposed to be back till tomorrow.
I was gonna clear these out and make some "welcome back" scones!
Why's your crap on my desk? Why's her crap on my desk?
Mary, there was a leak, some water damage in the back, so she set up shop temporarily.
temporarily.
Oh, I see.
so. We're good?
temporarily.
Yes, it was totally temporary.
no, I mean we're temporarily good.
okay, good.
never again.
Hey, listen, after you meet with your witness,
I was thinking we'd run a "duck and hide" on Lancer.
Aw, you two desk-mates develop your own secret little code-language?
so sweet. Excuse me while I puke on this puke.
we're talking about Stan. - What about him?
whoa, whoa, back up. Is there Stan gossip?
I'm on the sidelines six months and you withhold?
you know I live for Stan gossip.
all right, hit me. - Stanley McQueen has taken a lover.
No! Oh, my god, this is huge! And ew!
is she cute? Is she fat? Tell me she's fat.
hold on, is it someone we know?
brief me, down to the last dirty
Oh, hey, Stan. We were just - Catching Mary up on some office business.
Yeah, you were.
Yeah, well, it's gonna have to wait. Tippy's on his way in with Ivan.
Mary, got a minute? Something I want to show you.
well? So?
come on, what do you think?
of the janitor's closet? - No, Mary, this is for you. It's your station.
for, you know, induced lactation.
Oh, man.
okay, well, first of all, i'm not breast-feeding anymore, but, more to the point, do you have any idea how gross that phrase is,"induced lactation"?
especially coming out of that mouth.
there he is.
Oh, hey, Tippy. Long time no see.
new girl in town, huh? Well, I better get in there.
Oh, and hey, about that whole "i shot a guy on my last day at work so I need counseling" thing
we both know i'm good to go, so let's just skip the formalities with the "fink the shrink,"?
Mary? Not so fast.
my extensive post-graduate work and years of field experience tell me that you're less than happy to be here.
also the look on your face.
so now what?
is now when I open up about rachel from summer camp and the night they let us lock up the crafts cabin all by ourselves?
I'm open to discussing latent sexual questions if you're confused.
I'll bet you are, you little vixen.
or we can get on with why you're really here.
I shot a suspect, then went into labor.
next?
Oh, my god! It's not okay!
I found a suitcase with the baby stuff.
Thanks, Marshall. - Oh, god, this sucks!
angel, it'll be better if we just - Oh, my god, you did this twice?
no wonder you drank.
so we've got quite a menu board here.
the shooting of a suspect, your decision to change your mind about the adoption and raise your child as a single mother.
look, I'm fine, Shelly. - So there's nothing we need to discuss.
motherhood can be quite a transition, especially for someone used to being so.
you.
okay.
it's okay.
please. Please, please, please.
this is all about expressing my feelings, right?
okay. I feel strongly- Very strongly-about getting my weapon back now.
and yet Stan tells me you're the one who brought up counseling.
Yeah, when I made it clear I didn't need it.
Shelly, come on. Look, I got to get back to work, now, and seriously, that's not just my chapped nipples talkin'.
see you tomorrow, Mary. As for today, nice work. ish.
if it was your mother, you wouldn't be calling it hysterical.
you'd be doing what I'm doing.
Marshall! Marshall, I'm telling you, you have to go get my mom, now!
hold on, Ivan. Have a seat.
what makes you think your mother's in trouble?
her nih grant money didn't come through.
that's not the whole - Her funding was through the nih.
do you know which senator controls the nih?
uh, health and human services subcommittee-that's Raleigh.
senator Raleigh was a regent. Class of '75.
same class as Brockton's father.
I'm-I'm telling you, they made this happen.
Ivan, I just think you're mythologizing the reach of these people a bit.
no, I know exactly what those monsters are capable of.
I watched one of them push my friend off a roof like it was nothing - Like he was nothing.
Brockton is a wealthy, entitled psycho who can't find me, so he's going after my mom.
we already talked to her, Ivan.
we can't just keep going back until we convince her to come into witsec.
fine.
then I will.
one little college lab sees its funding go poof, and suddenly i'm someheart of darkness puppet-master?
please. - Well, you did something to keep your son in school instead of a cell block in sing sing and jumpsuit-orange.
wait, so you're saying my father paid off a judge to grant me make-able bail?
do you want to go on record with that?
of course not, that'd be slander.
indeed it would be.
gentlemen, it's been a pleasure, but I'm afraid our little chitchat'll have to come to an end here, unless one of you has a warrant tucked in your $10 suit?
thought so.
it's a nice suit.
cocky s. o.b. Kid doesn't just think he's above the law, he's sure of it.
can't imagine where he got that idea. Brockton sr. Founded Brockton systems.
they're like google, but, you know, if google's motto was "be evil."
See,'cause google's motto is "don't be evil."
Hey, I read the business section enough to know a bribe wouldn't be a drop in the bucket to his old man.
a bribe might not even be necessary. He could've just called in a favor.
the regents have pull in spades.
bottom line, professor Gunter's safer with us than at Winston, especially with the Brockton kid and his dad's money lurking around.
professor Gunter?
Oh, my god.
thank god you're here.
I need to see my son.
Stan's taking professor Gunter back to the office.
I'm gonna go grab Ivan at his place.
Delia's meeting me. We'll break the news, the family reunion'll be complete.
you want one more?
I think delia and I can handle it. Wait till you're cleared and I'll
I was talking to Norah, dummy.
thanks for bringing me down with the finkel reminder.
it's therapy, it's harmless. You lie down, talk
"lie down"? Easy, penthouse forum. It's okay.
you did go "johnny cash" on a man the same day you went into labor.
are you seriously siding with her? She dumped you.
she didn't dump. We never - We had coffee.
Yeah, that's what makes it so sad.
Hey, listen, I gotta go. Here.
so I get to take Norah with me to the studio today?
Yeah, but just make sure she's fully strapped into her car seat, and that her head's not falling forward.
call me. Hey? Keep me, you know
in the loop. - That idea, not those words.
you texted me 33 times yesterday. That's not a loop. It's a noose.
now that mommy's gone, we're gonna have so much fun.
can I just say how amazing it is having Mary back on the job?
and you're hoping i'll repeat that to her.
I really miss having her around. - It's cool, I'll tell her.
you can stop now. - Of course, sure thing. Not a problem.
you don't need to acquiesce in triplicate.
you're right. Absolutely. Got it.
thank god you're here.
what happened? - They found me.
I think we got a bead on this.
the programming I've been doing, for my new job.
you got him a job as a programmer? - Supermarket chain.
nice work, zuckerberg.
the head of the i. t. Department said I could work from home.
now coding's a small part of the job, but all programming has a signature.
an identifiable pattern the coder leaves behind.
you think they tracked you via this coding signature?
it's possible.
the regents could sift data, find Ivan's programming, and track it to his ip address.
that would require a mastodonic degree of data-sifting capability.
Yeah, mastodonic. Huge sifters.
or several smaller sifters.
no. - Okay.
there are only a handful of servers in the country with that capability.
one of them is at Brockton systems.
the company owned by the killer's father. Not the worst theory I've ever heard.
maybe not the best, either. Just because it's possible doesn't mean it's plausible.
look, it's just my first day back, but I get the feeling you two are hiding something.
inspector, are you accusing my witnesses of obstructing justice?
if they wanted Ivan out of the way as a witness, they would've just killed him - And his mom, but they didn't.
they were searching for something, not someone, because they found the someone, and you're still upright.
she's right, we are hiding something.
Yeah! I knew it. See, who the hell needs a gun? Gun, schmun.
it started last year.
gambling online, on the regent's site. As a release.
it was fun, that's all.
until it wasn't.
after a few months, it became a real problem.
Yeah, if you call being in debt to them 180 grand "a problem.
I ran through my retirement and all of my savings, yes.
I went to the regents, and I asked to work it off, webmastering, beefing up the firewall, stuff like that.
they said yes, and I started coding.
you programmed an illegal site to pay off your mom's gambling debts?
you couldn't just be, I don't know, a tour guide?
when I started coding for them, I couldn't believe any of it.
all the former regents- W-wait. Time out.
former regents involved in illegal gambling?
dozens of them, and at high stakes.
uh, businessmen, politicians, names you'd read on-on the cover offorbes orthe economist-On the covers.
when I saw Brockton push Henry off the roof,
I knew we need protection.
so I downloaded a list.
regents, uh, their bets, wins, losses, money-transfers, everything.
he, uh, he told Brockton jr. That he had evidence
that he would give the list to the fbi if anything happened to me.
that's why you felt safe staying behind at Winston.
Yeah.
no.
no, I - I stayed behind because my research.
is the most important thing in my life.
it's more important than anything else, and I can't believe that I would say that out loud.
I can't believe that anyone could say that out loud, but...
I've ruined my research.
and I've ruined my life.
and not just mine.
I'm so sorry. - Well, you should be.
this, uh, this alleged evidence, where is it now?
uh, it's on a thumb drive. I hid it near my apartment.
you're right, that's what they were looking for.
Delia's moving lynn into the albuquerque hotel as we speak.
she and Ivan will stay there till they're relocated.
great. Then I'll check out if little man tate was right.
no, I got the data-sifting angle.
if Brockton systems is using its server to track Ivan down, we'll know by the end of the day.
meantime, Marshall, take Ivan back to his apartment, secure the thumb drive with the list of names, get it back here asap.
already on it. I've arranged for abq pd to assist.
you've "arranged," like it's official.
you called up nancy drew on her new hello kitty cell phone.
note that I have not yet said,"great to have you back.
note that you let delia steal my desk.
it was temporary!
Hey, whoa, whoa, Stan, not so fast. What's my assignment?
so...
needle, thread. Cushiony thing you stick pins in.
we're not doing word-association. I asked you about Norah's father.
okay, here we go.
okay. - All righty.
uh, wipes, please.
what am i, your scrub-nurse? They're right there, hawkeye.
okay.
good girl. - Like that?
that's right. - All righty.
no, no, no! No one uses talcum powder anymore. You'll give her diaper lung.
no such thing as "diaper lung."
that's great, you broke the baby.
the pregnancy was unplanned?
uh, yes, not that it's any of your business.
sorry, what does my family planning have to do with the shooting?
I don't know, but 39-year-olds don't tend to have accidents with birth control.
yeah they do, all the time.
you want my theory? - Guess.
your sister was getting her act together - "Was" being the operative word.
your mother was sober. - Still is.
you need someone new to protect, so you got yourself knocked up.
be careful, she's slipping. Seriously, she'll sink.
Mary that's impossible, there's only an inch of water.
okay, but I think, you know - Good. Seriously, she's good.
no more baths. I'll just use wipes.
it's okay. - For the rest of her life?
Yeah, for the rest of her life. Come on, love.
it's okay. It's okay.
so? My theory, what do you think?
I think the hour's up.
I knew if they found me, they'd turn my place upside-down, so
hiding a flash-drive under a rock.
there's a harmonious incongruity to your use of tools, if not the keenest sense of security.
it's still here, isn't it?
Ivan, we're gonna get you resituated at a secure hotel. Want to go pack a bag?
how'd we do? - Broad daylight.
no one saw or heard a thing. Whoever broke in was a pro.
best money can buy.
Hey, what do you say we pick up oscar from the vet afterwards?
Yeah, he's done five hours, hard time. You follow me, okay?
okay.
it's so not the same.
who's saying it is? I'm just saying we were up all night with oscar, the stomach thing.
I swear to god, there should be a special prison
a wing at gitmo - For people who compare owning an animal to having a baby.
would you call it your pet peeve?- Ooh, fun, word-play!
look, dogs are lazy, Marshall, they're laconic.
babies are terrorists. They're relentless. They never let you rest.
they're like little, fat alarm clocks.
right, so if you'd let me and ab babysit once in awhile
Yeah. Leave Norah with you two. - She couldn't be in better hands.
ab's a detective who effectively raised three younger siblings, and I'm a marshal from a family
this is detective chaffee, intersection of lead and coal. I need an ambulance.
Albuquerque pd!
Marshall! Marshall! Are you all right?
thumb drive! Check for the thumb drive!
it's gone.
Hey. - Hey.
so he's okay, huh? - Yes.
docs gave him an mri. We got lucky, no concussion.
just a nasty flesh wound, He's fine, enough to send me out for oscar.
God, and you're all right? - Yeah.
two guys shoot up your car, an hour later you're running out for the dog.
Marshall wanted to see him, so I used my badge to get him in. Aren't they the best?
Oh, yeah. They're - They're the best, for sure.
okay. Okay, that's all right. - Oscar, sit!
okay. - Sit. Sorry, Mary.
that's quite all right. That's-they're really great.- Sit.
Hey! - Oh, look at you.
what are you thinking?
Oscar, you freak. You feeling better?
Stan and Tippy are waiting for us at the office. Give me a ride?
Yeah, let me just bring the car around.- Oh, I
Oh, no, yeah. It's-makes sense.- See you back there.
actually, I'm gonna head home. I've got to relieve jinx.
Mary, get some rest. I know how exhausted you must be.
we were up all night with oscar - Yeah, well, we should really - Yeah, you really should.
well, I gotta get one of you back to the office, the other one a mix of dry food and white rice.
I'll call you later and fill you in, see if the apb turns up anything.
Oh, and hey, if I see your friends with the flag, the fife, and the old-fashioned drum, - i'll send 'em your way. - Good one.
it's 'cause of the - Got it.
okay.
we crapped out on the Brockton systems warrant.
no evidence they used their servers to sift for Ivan's ip address.
doesn't mean they're innocent. Just means we can't prove it.
well, what we do know for certain is that someone was willing to kill a u. s.Marshal and an abq cop to get their hands on Ivan's list.
how you doing? You all right?
slight ringing in my ear that I'll be happy to overlook just as soon as we catch these guys.
now, you saw Ivan's list, correct? His evidence against the regents?
you think the kid's making it up? - I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying without the physical drive itself and without any computer forensics, all this talk of prominent former regents involved in a gambling site is inadmissible.
meaning- Meaning whoever t-boned my inspector off the road to steal that drive knew exactly what they were doing.
here we go. Here we go. Let me give you-hi.
Hi. - There you go. That's a good girl.
Oh, mom, tell me I did not just see that.
what? It's french fries. She loves french fries.
she can't eat people food.
why not? She's a people.
and besides, you eat her food all the time.
please. Fine, maybe the peaches. The occasional apricot
and the pears and the plums.
the point is - Is that her monitor?
what's it doing out here? - The batteries died.
you leave it on too much.
mom, then how did you watch her during her nap?
with this new thing they've come up with-my eyes.
Oh, my god.- You don't need all this high-tech equipment, Mary.
low-tech works just fine.- Come here.
Oh, right, if low-tech worked just fine, why'd they invent high-tech?
low-tech is how I raised you and your sister.
and case closed.
okay. I know I wasn't a perfect mother.
but I have been helping you with Norah since the day she was born.
Yes. - Do you want to know why?
cause you're her grandmother.
because it's a living amends, Mary, a do-over, a chance to do things right, to make it up to you, to make it up to the universe
well, let's not personify the universe.
honey, I know-I know you want to protect Norah as much as you possibly can.
so do i, that's why I'm here.
but you can't protect her from everything, kiddo.
I'm just saying.
low tech.
Hey, I got here as fast as I could. What's up?
you got a lith fair-based emergency?
I know how the regents found Ivan.
you think they bugged your house? I thought I was the conspiracy nut.
is that Tippy and Brockton, sr?
tippy was a regent at harvard. Brockton's father pinned him.
he was a senior when Tippy was a freshman.
the regents didn't use computers to find Ivan.
they went low tech. They used Tippy.
Jesus, we've worked eight cases with the guy. We had drinks.
Tippy's our breach?
and he almost got you killed. Hope he sprung for the drinks.
you sure you weren't followed? You took a secure route from the office?
of course - Or I would've, but I didn't come from the office, I came from a...
personal event. - "Personal event"? What personal event?
it's personal - A personal event. Hence my phraseology.
Ohh, you mean like - So Mary's upstairs briefing Ivan and his mom.
figure you keep Tippy busy and in the dark for an hour?
happy to. I had a little talk with the u. s.Attorney last night, and gave her enough to run his phone records.
don't tell me he's been making calls to his old regent buddy, Brockton sr?
talking ever since Tippy started on Ivan's case.
we trusted him. That was the whole point.
we suspect the regents pulled strings to get him assigned to your case.
you believe me now, how connected they are?
we do.
and while it's unorthodox, we need your help to bait him out.
what?
tippy boswell's not a hardened criminal.
he's an a. u.s. a. Gone bad, so the threat level is manageable, and the department of justice is comfortable with it.
hell, they're eager.
the question is, are you?
totally. I'm in. - Good.
wait a second."threat level"?
he's 18 years old. Is this dangerous?
it's a controlled location. It's secure.
of course, we'll take every precaution.
but I'm not gonna lie to you. There's always a risk.
then I will do it.- Wha-?
Ivan! It's time that I cleaned up my own mess.
what do I need to do?
we've got nothing on the attack on Marshall.
no i. d. On the assailant, phony plates, no decent leads...
so linking it back to Brockton and the-and the regents, that's-that's pretty much a dead end?
looks that way.
could be it wasn't them at all.
could be it was a random attack, entirely unrelated.
there was other evidence in that box. - I hadn't considered that.
it's worth pursuing. What do you think? - Absolutely.
Oh, I gotta take this.
um, I'm with someone right now.
take your call. Go ahead, it's okay.
I'm gonna get on that.
I'm here. You were saying?
the list that was on the thumb drive that was stolen? I have another copy.
does Ivan know about it? - No.
uh, I made a backup, just in case, but I think it's best if I turn it over to you.
uh, so have you told anyone else? Your witsec inspectors?
who, Mary? With her big mouth?
verisimilitude.
or Marshall, he would just bore me to death trying to talk shop on data-mining.
that thing you said.
well, you've-you've- You've done the right thing by calling me, lynn.
I will be at your hotel in 45 minutes.
meet me in the lobby by the gift shop, all right? - Okay.
I'll see you then.
you sure no one followed you? No inspectors?
no. Uh, I told them I had to run down to the gift shop for some toothpaste.
good. Given the reach of these people, we don't know who we can trust.
you have the backup drive?
once a regent, always a regent, right Tippy?
hands on your head. Keep 'em there.
hands where we can see 'em.
all clear.
we built this fortress, right?
WITSEC. Impenetrable, safe.
you think you can trojan horse your way inside these walls, you snaky son of a bitch?
I'm not saying a word until I have an attorney present.
you think you're what, masters of the universe?
pulling every last string and the levers of the law?
maybe.
but if you think you can come after my people, my friends, pal, you have no idea.
you have royally screwed yourself...
inside-out, upside-down, backwards, sideways, ways you can't even comprehend.
no attorney in the world's gettin' you outta this jam, Tippy.
Regent or not.
get him out of my face.
peaches, apricots, plums, and pears.
who says I steal food from babies?
Norah's asleep, and I got new batteries for the monitor so I could hear her.
mom, don't be - Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you, and I know I'm lucky to have you here.
and you were right and I was wrong, so please just accept this apology, 'cause it's the only one you're gonna get.
mom?
mom, what?
you know how she wasn't returning my phone calls, and I thought she was busy with scott?
he called me.
she's been drinking...A lot.
okay.- iMaybe the wedding, or
well, we all need a few shots after that one.
no, this is serious. He's really worried.
apparently she went on a bender last week-all week.
I'm - Oh, mom.
I'm leaving in the morning.
what? Mom, are you serious?
I mean, Brandi does what Brandi does and you just - You just go running?
I'm sorry, sweetie, but my baby needs me.
my baby needs you!
she has her mother, Mary. She has you.
Yeah, okay, I mean Look, what-what- What am I supposed to do about work?
Mary. When I hit bottom, after my last vodka tonic, you said something to me I will never forget.
lesser people than you have done more difficult things than this.
I didn't mean that.
I know you can do this. - God.
Mary, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
never seen a guy fold this fast, like a goddamn lawn chair.
ratted out Brockton sr. And all the other regents that helped his kid out.
so much for brotherhood.
Hey, look at this.
I'll admit, after Tippy, your conspiracy theories have gained some traction around here.
that one was all Mary. - Don't make nice.
we're not finished with the desk thing.
it was temporary.
inspector McQueen. Oh, hey.
Yeah. Okay, one sec.
I'm gonna grab this. Carry on.
did you see that? That was the-you know, that's the "personal event."
Yeah, and he was humming. Humming.
exactly. Sure, Stan's a positive guy, chipper.
I mean, hell, he's a jolly white george jefferson, but he is not a hummer.
that came out wrong.
what's going on? - Stan's on the phone with his "personal event."
Ooh, I'll go eavesdrop!
inspector shannon? - Yeah?
they-they said something about me and Ivan being relocated separately to different cities?
that's right. - But.Why?
isn't there anything you can do? He needs me.
I don't think so.
forgive me, but I think - I think this is about you needing him.
Lynn, he's a grown-up. He's told us this is what he wants. Some space.
he said that? - Yes.
maybe it's not forever. It's possible we can revisit with doj down the line.
look, I'm sorry, I get that he's your child and that you love him, but I mean, that's kind of the point, right?
of being a parent? Things are hard, but...
things you'd never do otherwise...
you do 'em anyway.
mom?
I'm ready to talk about the shooting.
it was horrible. He deserved it, and I'd do it again.
but it hurt you to hurt him.
I didn't hurt him. I killed him.
I had to...To protect Stan, to protect Marshall.
cause that's what I do. I protect people.
which is why you didn't make an adoption plan for Norah.
she was so tiny, so fragile.
but most of all, she was mine.
I just felt like - Feel like...
I just realized, no one could protect her like I would, like I can.
good. Okay, I think we're good.
go get your weapon. - Really?
it's that easy? Just vomit up some dime-store schmaltz and I get my gun back?
nothing is easy with you, Mary. Welcome back.
congratulations, by the way, on Norah.
Thanks. Yeah, she's pretty cool.
I can pre-board planes now, so hey you. Hi.
let's see what you got.
that's okay. I know, I know.
children are our phantom limbs.
even when they leave, they're never really gone.
they come back from time to time for laundry or a shoulder or a fist full of cash.
I asked you about Norah's father?
wipes, please.
what am I, your scrub nurse? They're right there, hawkeye.
mark's a, you know, good father.
assistant A. D.Campbell, what a pleasant surprise.
once I'm tapped as head of witsec, I can be an even better friend.
Almonso's shutting down ABQ Witsec.
what? - You heard me.
this office is shutting its doors.
so, want to be friends?
I know, I know. Look. I promise this is a one-time thing, okay?
mark had to work, I couldn't find a sitter, and honestly, how much trouble can she be? She's a baby.
motherhood can be quite a transition.
especially for someone used to being so you.
you take this one.
the wives always hate me.
you sure? I think I smell beef rendang.
I'll take some to go.
and if there's sticky rice- - There's always sticky rice.
Mrs. Dujana, I'm not worried about your husband.
he's made his decision. I am worried about you.
I have told you all I know. He left one night.
he did not even take his cell phone.
you realize I'm trained to spot liars?
it's not hard, honestly.
you say he left his phone. I believe you.
but when I ask,"have you seen him?"you look up and to the left.
now, in most folks, that indicates they're accessing a memory.
the thing is, you're left-handed, so it's reversed.
when you look up and to the left, I know that you are fabricating a lie.
will you send me back to Indonesia?
not if you tell me where your husband went.
Fredericks, get down!- FBI!- On your knees. Now.-Hold it right there.
what is going on?
ma'am, need you to remain calm. This man's not with us.
he's not FBI.
okay. All right.
watch your head.
somewhere between the primordial soup and the dirty cell phone pic,
leon Festinger called it cognitive dissonance.
worst part is it works, if only for a while.
listen, we got to swap. I need you to take Norah today. - What?
mark, no, we have a joint calendar for a reason.
Yeah, I know, but I've been trying to land a meeting with this guy for two months.
Dan Mcilvane is a whale.
he runs third-party logistics in the southwest.
all right, now you're just gluing random words together.
warehouses the size of football fields.
the dude needs a monster amount of solar paneling, and I've got a legit shot.
it's my job. I have a job.
gosh, what's that like? Come on, Mark, please?
you're so much better at this crap than I am.
please? Please?
all right, fine. I'll handle it today. - Thank you.
but eventually, we're gonna have to figure something out.
and barring some miraculous recovery by Brandi, your mother's not walking through that door. It's been a month. We need help.
right, fine, okay. Let's just take baby steps.
let's just make it to the weekend.
deal? - Fine.
have fun with that.- Yeah.- That's almost hostile. You got her?
you cutie. - Okay. Oh, and, hey.
Yes, bottle at noon, nap at 1: 30.
no-i mean, yes, but- I really appreciate this. Thanks.
hold on. I just want proof that that actually happened.
that's cute. - There it is. bye.
cognitive dissonance is simple.
you convince yourself that whatever it is in front of you is exactly what you want
that it's good and right.
especially when it's not.
here's one for those memoirs I'm not allowed to write.
Eddie Fredericks.
former navy seal turned enemy of the state.
in custody 36 hours.
FBI caught him posing as one of their own.
tracking foreign nationals here at home for a guy homeland security's been after for the better part of the last decade.
now he's our problem.
such is the nature of our curious enterprise.
no. I need assurances.
so does the department of justice.
that's why we need you to sign the m. o.u.
I'm giving you everyone I know.
this here is garbage.
I need to see your ops plan for my security, okay?
my partner's still out there.
she is trained just like me. She will find me.
she's insane. - Eddie, relax.
we're gonna keep you safe. It's what we do.
I can't believe this.
all I did was track down the bad guys here at home.
your loyalty to god and country not with standing, Eddie, you were tracking people for Abu Patek.
this guy funds jihad against a country you swore an oath to protect.
I wasn't in league with him.
I only met the man once. I was a contractor.
if people ran from Patek, we located them, simple as that.
u. S.Marshals will escort you to a safe witsec unit where you'll serve your time under our protection.
your partner's tracking prowess and mental health will become instantly irrelevant.
you don't understand.
well, help us understand, because your resume's kind of... Thin.
what can I say?
military paid me to do things no one wants to read about.
and they stopped paying.
you got wounded and- - Civilian got shot and I got railroaded.
my C. O.um, wanted me to say this guy had a gun.
I wouldn't do it.
officially, I outlived my-My operational usefulness.
so you went freelance as a way of, what, pushing back? - No.
I went freelance because they didn't give me a choice.
Eddie, we could help you, okay?
we could protect you from your partner, all enemies, foreign or domestic.
