Geekdad: explain how the subconscious mind can better determine how we actually feel about what our conscious mind is interacting with and how that applies to film.
Geekdad: how do you plan on measuring these differences?
Geekdad: how is your work and process different from the work of steven quartz, director of the social cognitive neuroscience laboratory at caltech who is working with hollywood to use neuromarketing to measure reactions for movie trailers?
