a forensic analysis confirms that this tape bears the precise electromagnetic artifacts as the videotape of you and Terrence Rourke at the Chateau Hotel.
in other words, these two tapes were made by the exact same camera, Jenny.
your camera.
would you please explain to this jury why you lied about whose camera was used to make the tape?
I didn't lie. I... I guess Terry used my camera.
that's not what you said.
you said, "He showed me his camera."
he must have brought it with him.
your testimony is on record.
shall I have it read back?
a brief recess, Your Honor?
denied.
ms. Dennison, would you please tell this jury why you videotaped yourself and Terrence Rourke having sex at the Chateau Hotel?
it was all a big misunderstanding.
did you tell Terrence you were videotaping your sexual encounter?
no, but... Why not?
I didn't think he'd care.
but he did care, did he not? In fact, he was horrified by what you did. What happened when Terrence Rourke realized what you were up to?
when Terry spotted the camera, he got really mad.
he was scared his mom would see the tape.
stark: Because you intended to make the tape public.
I didn't say that!
is it humanly possible that you could have released this tape to cause a scandal that would launch your career?
no. You didn't give the tape to the police.
you took your bloody little fingers, walked down the hall, and slipped it to your manager.
and now it somehow magically-- miracle of miracles
finds its way onto the Internet.
now everybody's talking about it-- talking about you
the week your first album is about to be released.
can you look this jury in the eye and tell any single one of them that this is a cosmic accident?
now, would you kindly tell this jury what happened in that hotel room between you and Terrence Rourke?
Terry tried to grab the tape.
he wrestled me onto the bed, his knee was on my chest.
I should have just given it to him.
stark: Why didn't you?
I don't know.
I couldn't breathe.
I got scared. I was still kind of drunk.
when I grabbed the knife,
I just wanted to scare him, to make him stop.
I don't know how this all happened.
stark: Jenny, you do, because the moment you met Terrence Rourke, you decided to videotape your sexual encounter.
that part was premeditated, was it not?
Yes, but I swear to God, I never meant to hurt him.
please believe me.
I do.
but your plan cost him his life.
it cost Elizabeth Rourke her only child.
there is no greater loss.
no further questions, Your Honor.
Hi. Let me get a photo with the man of the hour.
your Honor.
madam District Attorney, por favor.
beginner's luck.
it's called winning. One more?
don't worry-- you'll get used to it.
that's good. Thank you, Your Honor.
Thanks, Manny.
I am going to give you exactly 30 seconds to gloat.
Hey, you-you do know you just won a huge case, right?
Yeah.
you look like you just lost your best friend.
I'm about to lose a hell of a lot more than that.
as stipulated in your parents' divorce decree, having reached the age of 16, you must now designate which parent will act as custodian until your 18th birthday.
have you reached a decision?
Yes.
my mother's been everything to me.
my protector, my best friend.
when my parents got a divorce,
I thought the world was coming to an end.
but she made sure it didn't.
I mean, she was a mess, but she pretended like everything was okay so that I wouldn't be scared.
and it wasn't always easy.
I can be a real pain.
but my mom taught me that it's not enough to love someone when it's easy.
you got to love them when it's hard.
when they don't deserve it, when they're in trouble.
that's what family does.
which is why I choose to live with my dad.
I'm as surprised as you are, probably more.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Oh, I'm not hurt.
well, okay, I'm a little hurt, but mostly I'm scared.
I mean, no offense, Sebastian, but you are incredibly self-absorbed.
no offense taken.
well, seriously, do you have any idea what it takes to raise a teenage girl alone in Los Angeles?
no, but if this is what Julie wants, I...
what she wants! She's 16!
she wants a Porsche, a date with Prince William, and world peace.
uh, Mom... She's a child.
my whole life is here.
Oh, Jules.
if this is really what you want...
...I can't stop you.
I just hope to God you know what you're doing.
this is the biggest case you'll ever get.
don't blow it.
Why?
you're the only father I'm ever going to have, and, if there is a God,
I'm the only kid you're ever going to have.
mom's really mad right now, but she'll get over it.
if I go to New York, you and I will exchange birthday cards and Christmas presents, but we'll wind up perfect strangers.
you may prefer that, but I don't.
the last thing I would ever want...
for once, don't say anything.
I've gone to the shrink long enough to know that I'll be screwed up for life if I don't get some closure on you and me.
and there's another reason why I chose you.
something you probably don't understand, and maybe you never will.
you need me.
we need to cede jurisdiction. Forget it.
I'm with you on this one, but our hands are tied.
you want plausible deniability? You just say I disobeyed a direct order, say I was off my meds.
Sebastian... There are lives at stake, Jess.
including Casey's. Think the Feds give a damn?
it's on us.
Madame District Attorney.
perhaps you can give Stark here a little primer on the Supremacy Clause.
my office is in charge here, Agent Berlinger.
you're kidding me, right?
this is the culmination of a six-month investigation into the sale of explosives to Los Angeles gangs.
it's a local matter.
we're seeing it through.
you have ten minutes to clear out.
then I bring in a Marine division and place anyone who interferes under arrest.
BERLINGER: Amir Khan.
billionaire arms dealer.
dual Pakistani and American citizenship.
Bureau's been after him for years.
khan uses his import-export business as cover.
he's smart, and he doesn't care about his body count.
chemical signatures from the C-4
he sells have been found in explosions in Oslo,
Tel Aviv and Edinburgh.
am I boring you, Stark?
I'm sorry, is there going to be a quiz?
the point is...
your surveillance of Khan is interfering with an ongoing federal investigation.
as soon as we get enough to take this guy down on federal explosives charges, we're gonna move on him.
Khan's C-4 is responsible for a number of deaths in this city.
and if we nail him, he'll give us enough that we can shut down those in this country financing terror.
and how long is that gonna take?
a year? Two years?
meanwhile, this guy's wreaking havoc here, now, today.
which is why we will retain jurisdiction over Khan's activities here in L. A.
I appreciate your position, but when those activities raise national security implications...
how about L. A. security implications?
that rap group blown up in their SUV last month.
you think it was really a faulty fuel-injection?
khan has been unloading plastique and Taliban surplus weapons to our street gangs.
three car bombs in the past five months. Nine dead.
we're not bowing out so you guys can screw up somewhere down the line.
you've got a big mouth, Stark.
and you're a brainless political hack. All right.
look, we're both on the same side here.
but I've got a mandate to reduce gang violence by stemming the flow of weapons to our streets.
and stopping Khan, that tops the agenda.
we're going forward.
well, I want regular updates.
you move...
we're in the loop.
all right, so how close are we to bringing off a sting operation?
to nail Khan, I've got to coordinate six agencies in L. A. County. I've got to establish a site for the buy. I got to get Khan to bite.
I mean, best guess-- a week.
forget it. Berger will make an ex parte motion-- try to federalize this.
we have to go tomorrow.
no pressure.
I'll make it happen.
you want to do this tonight?
we got the feds breathing down our necks.
no way. There's a reason why we've been slow playing Khan.
he'll get hinky if we push things up
look, when this started, I asked the Gang Unit for their two best detectives.
I believe I got 'em.
now are you going to make this happen or what?
there's no way.
khan will smell a setup.
fine. You know what, let's just pack it in.
six months of work wasted.
we'll spend the next six months informing next of kin.
what's the plan?
thank you.
Khan's lawyer will argue entrapment.
we need to establish a predisposition to sell us the C-4.
if the target balks committing a crime we usually pull back, reset things, plan another buy.
but now we don't have that luxury.
push the guy if you have to. This is our only shot.
you guys make the buy-- we'll make it stick.
Where's our confidential informant?
well, he's freaked, but he's on his way in.
what do we know about this guy?
Emilio Perez, small-time thief who was looking at three strikes for shoplifting.
so he's working it off as a C. I.
we put him into play as Khan's handyman.
gives him access to his schedule, knowledge of people around him.
is he reliable?
till now, but he's definitely the nervous type.
anyone would be nervous in his position.
Emilio's been solid.
he'll be solid on the stand.
he'd better. His testimony about Khan's operations and movements are going to put this bastard away.
I'll baby-sit him, if need be.
LAPD's got that covered.
Emilio Perez's lawyers just made an emergency motion for an early termination of his probation.
our confidential informant wants out.
raina, you're coming with me. Let's go, guys, come on.
lawyer: Mr. Perez has provided information crucial to more than a dozen prosecutions over the past two years.
which is why he's not rotting in Pelican Bay, Your Honor.
the D. A.'s unconscionable demands have monopolized his time and caused extreme emotional and mental distress.
Oh, please...
Mr. Perez has paid his debt, Your Honor.
his parole should be terminated.
benefit of the bargain, Judge.
Mr. Perez enjoyed the benefit of staying out of jail.
and now he must adhere to his end of the bargain as a confidential government informant.
if Mr. Perez refuses to cooperate, the people demand that he be promptly incarcerated.
Mr. Perez may find the demands made on him onerous, but there's nothing coercive about his plea agreement.
your Honor... Motion denied.
stark: Thank you, Your Honor.
you and Martin make sure this bozo gets on the bus.
you need to calm down.
everything you asked, I did.
I'm done.
Terminado, okay? You heard the judge, it doesn't work that way.
I have a family.
we're not going to let anything happen to you.
you'll be off-site with us, ID'ing people from a remote location. A piece of cake.
perez: Maybe for you.
khan knows who I am.
if he figures out I gave him up...
we bring in Khan, you testify, you're done.
Khan's people will find me.
I just want to have a life, okay?
I want to live with my wife and daughter.
away from all this.
you will, but right now you need to finish what you started.
go home, play with your daughter.
lay low until the buy goes down tonight.
soon you can put all of this behind you.
a hundred keys of C-4, that's a lot of bang-bang.
would run you 900 G's.
TARVER: Not a problem.
and you need this tonight, why?
blowing up Staples Center?
no, the Lakers are playing tonight.
something came up.
Yeah, huh?
point is, we got the cash. Your boy wants to deal, we deal.
he doesn't, find another seller.
I'll be in touch.
nothing personal, yo, but, uh, for the kind of jack we talking about, we only deal with the big man here on out.
seller: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10: 00 p. m. roof of the parking garage at Foster and Crenshaw.
khan will make the drop himself.
nice work. We're halfway home.
Khan's smart, but he's never been in the system.
which means he's arrogant. That can work for us.
we'll have 360 degree visuals on you guys and you'll be miked up.
he gonna be there?
isaac has ten years of buy and busts.
you want him there.
off-site surveillance is in place.
stark: We got one shot at this, guys.
let's make it work.
we got a problem?
there is no "we.
you're going to want to dial back that attitude, Tarver.
TARVER: You plant evidence, embarrass the job, resign in disgrace.
and you're talking to me about my attitude.
so you're telling me if your partner was shot, you'd just let the guy who did it escape?
Hey, Isaac's cool, Willy.
I'll be in the car, Ray.
Willy's all right once you get to know him.
you just keep him out of my way.
I thought we had plain-clothes tracking him.
he bolted. Went into a deli, ran out the back.
he's the only one who knows all the players.
we should've put an ankle bracelet on that little weasel.
I'll have LAPD start a canvass.
you told me he was reliable.
damn it.
too late. Going to have to go without him.
Lewis, can you bring us in closer?
zooming in.
who's this?
you've been in there for seven hours with this guy.
tell me he's got something for us.
nothing beyond what we already know.
James Weyland, 19, sophomore at Culver Community.
ridiculous. Says some guy paid him 200 bucks to deliver a suitcase.
and that guy got $200 to hire James.
well, can the kid I. D. anybody?
Nope.
all right. Kick him.
you know, this C. I. of yours is working both sides.
look, I'm sure there's a good reason. If you stand up for that two-faced lowlife one more time, you're going out the window. MARTIN: Raina's down at the Division. She said the detectives that are staking out the Perez house just radioed in-- the wife just got home.
okay, you and Isaac, meet up with Raina and talk to the wife.
find Perez, bring him to me now.
we'll ask around, see if anyone else Perez has worked with has a line on him.
gang Intelligence. Their sources report chatter about a major C-4 buy going down later today.
that son of a bitch.
khan never intended to sell us the C-4.
he knew that our buy was a set-up.
he used it as a smokescreen.
he draws all our resources to one place, and sets up the real buy someplace else.
okay, you guys hook up with Gang Intelligence, find out who's really planning to buy this stuff.
that was the FAA.
Khan's cleared a flight pattern to Lucerne this afternoon.
lax? And Burbank, and Van Nuys. He's got private jets at each.
multiple flight patterns makes sense if you want to leave the country with a lot of cash and you're trying to avoid Customs.
cash you'd get from unloading C-4.
okay, put all three airports on high alert.
I'll take care of it.
Yeah. Speak.
great. Thanks.
LAPD. They got a sighting on Khan.
where are you going?
I'm gonna take the direct approach.
and you're going with me.
Casey can handle the FAA.
fill him in on the way. Let's go.
Uh-huh. That was good. Hope you had the blueberry pancakes--they're famous for 'em.
I don't believe we have been introduced.
Sebastian Stark, the DA's Office.
stark, yes-- I recall seeing you on TV.
I'm much better looking in person.
something I can do for you?
for starters, you can stop killing people.
I have no idea what you are talking about.
RPG's, the Kalashnikovs, the Semtex, all that crap ?
...it stops now.
you must have me confused with someone else.
khan is a very popular name.
not in my office.
I work in import-exports.
precious gems, high-end ceramics.
as for the allegation, I'm a...
murderer?
it was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Stark.
we must talk again.
count on it.
perhaps over...
blueberry pancakes?
so much for the direct approach.
I thought it went pretty well.
Where's Emilio?
I don't know. He left last night.
he did not tell me where he was going.
he tell you when he was coming back?
no.
is this a regular thing with him, Elena?
Emilio is a good man.
I don't ask where he goes.
what's at stake here.
by not showing up to meet us last night, Emilio could go to jail.
is that what you want for your family?
is that what you want for your daughter?
if you help us find Emilio, we'll work things out, I promise.
they took her.
they took my daughter.
someone kidnapped your daughter?
I came back from the Mercado two days ago.
Emilio was crying.
he said that they took Flora, and if he didn't do what they'd asked...
...they'd kill her.
martin: Did he know who took her?
no.
we will help you...
but you have to tell us where Emilio is.
Oh, I swear to God I don't know.
martin: We got LAPD looking for Flora on the down low.
if Khan thinks that Emilio went to the authorities, he might kill her.
where are we on locating Emilio?
we put a pen register on Elena's home phone.
she just threw a call into his cell.
cell location comes back to Downey.
Emilio mentioned a cousin in Downey
Javier, I think, owns an auto body shop.
you know your way around Downey?
I do. We got a bead on Emilio Perez.
Isaac'll fill you in. Where's your partner?
ray said he had something to take care of with Personnel.
I'll have him meet us down there. Right.
raina, Martin, you guys work the phones.
talk to people Emilio knows-- see if you can help locate him.
got it.
to what do I owe the displeasure?
always with the attitude.
I represent Amir Khan. My condolences.
my client is a respected businessman.
your client is a cold-blooded killer with no respect for human life, but hey, you say "potato...
I was hoping this would be amicable, but since you already dispensed with the civilities, let me say this
if you ever accuse my client publicly again, for anything, I will sue you and this office for defamation and malicious prosecution.
$500 an hour, and you still have a haircut that looks like it came with a bowl of soup-- go figure.
sometimes I'm so good I scare myself.
how does mobilizing Khan's attorney help bring him down? You know what?
I should charge you guys tuition.
I had to do something to draw Khan out, rattle his cage, and he went for it.
Bernhardt has been repping L. A.'s biggest gang figures since the Crips and the Bloods were kids squabbling over baseball cards. He also represents Khan, which could explain how a blue blood like Khan got plugged in to the gang world.
and if Bernhardt played matchmaker a universe of potential buyers for Khan's C-4
just got a whole lot smaller.
precisely.
I'm in awe.
you should be.
meet Casey at the courthouse.
see if Bernhardt recently filed legal papers on behalf of any gang member with an explosives fetish.
while we're young?
I just left Ray another message.
he's probably grabbing a piece of tail.
Yeah, well, lucky for us, Emilio didn't
listen, about yesterday...
eh, forget it, it's done.
Nuh-uh. I was out of line.
what happened with your partner...
you did what you had to do.
where is he? Interview Three.
stark: Missed you last night, Emilio-- heard you had a pressing obligation in Downey.
sorry, I... Shut up.
we know you're working for Khan.
that's not true. And we know about your daughter.
you want to see her alive again, you come clean right now--everything.
don't make him ask again.
can we talk alone?
no.
how long have you been feeding us false information?
three days.
what did you tell Khan about our operation?
everything. He has my daughter, okay?
when was your daughter taken? What's the difference?
what counts is that they have her!
look at me, Emilio.
we want to find Flora, but for that to happen, you can't lie to us anymore.
you got to tell us everything.
you can start by telling us who did the kidnapping.
his partner! Ray!
ray took her!
he's a bad cop! Lying son of a bitch!
get him out of here! I'll kill you.
get him out!
I swear to God, I swear to God, Ray took her.
he made me do this.
he works for Khan. How long have you known this?
since Ray came and took Flora.
you tell me the truth.
who's buying that C-4?
they don't tell me nothing.
but I know Khan has an apartment on Normandy and Wilshire.
the day Flora was taken, I followed Ray.
he went inside an apartment and came out with Khan.
I told him to give me back my daughter or I'll go to the police.
but Ray said he'd slit Flora's throat if I talked to anyone.
we'll get her back.
Where's your partner?
you can't believe anything that piece of crap Perez says.
he'd throw his own mama under the bus to save his ass.
Willy, where is Ray?
I don't know.
all right? He's not answering his cell.
Perez says they're holding his kid at Normandy and Wilshire.
I'm calling in SWAT. Let's hit it.
clear.
clear upstairs.
citric acid, acetone.
detonators. This place is a C-4 lab.
guy wasn't just smuggling explosives, he was making them!
the C-4's gone-- he either moved the stuff or the buy already went down.
we've got a body here.
shot once in the back.
TARVER: God, Ray!
that son of a bitch set Ray up!
all right, Willy, Willy... Willy!
bomb!
bomb
one dead, four injured.
martin: Bomb Squad says it was an IED hooked up to a time delay.
remotely detonated Perez sent us there.
he knew the place was booby trapped.
if that's true, I'll stick the needle in his arm myself.
what's his E.T.A?
sheriff's Department's bringing him down from County Lock-up right now. I'll talk to him when he gets here. No.
the only person you're talking to is a grief counselor.
ray was my damn partner.
you're gonna continue working on this case under one condition, you follow orders.
order number one:
you steer clear of Perez.
now what's the deal with this apartment?
rented in cash under a dead-end alias.
explosion destroyed any useful forensics.
okay, so to summarize, our case against Khan still sucks.
martin: FBI Agent Berlinger. Again.
he wants to know what we got.
tell him I'm still in court.
good news.
you must be in the wrong office.
white supremacist gang leader named Jake Forman was convicted of explosives possession three years ago.
got out last summer.
his attorney?
simo Forman fits the exact profile of someone itching to get their hands on C-4.
who says prayer doesn't work?
Madeleine, you and I are going judge shopping.
we're gonna get a wiretap on this guy Forman.
Casey, the motions clerk at the federal courthouse gave me a heads-up.
the Feds are seeking a cease and desist order.
they want to kill our investigation and go after Khan themselves.
I'll keep tabs.
now, check in with the Bomb Squad.
see what they got on this guy Forman.
okay? Guys.
we gotta get the rest of the C-4
off the streets before more people die and we gotta grab Khan before he leaves the country.
let's move.
TARVER: You got a minute?
thirty seconds.
bomb Squad's territorial.
they're gonna demand to be brought in on the investigation.
unless I can get a D. D. A. with me to pull rank.
Casey, I need you backing Tarver with the Bomb Squad.
got it.
got it.
my guy down at the Bomb Squad says they don't even have a file on Forman.
that's weird.
he did time for possession.
and C-4 isn't exactly a starter kit for explosives. Trust me.
bomb Squad's a black hole.
bunch of cowboys.
no one keeps records.
well, maybe we should head over there anyway.
see what we can find out. Waste of time.
I know a guy who may have intel on Forman.
he works down at the ADL.
he's got a file on every racist twitch on the West Coast.
you up for a ride?
let's go.
anything off the wiretap?
nothing we can use.
you know, Sebastian got us a wiretap in 20 minutes.
guy's a magician.
I have a front row seat...
I still don't know how he does it.
got you a burger.
mm, thanks.
appreciate it.
it's just a burger.
check this out.
man: Yeah, gonna rent a place in Mobley Heights.
getting screwed on the price.
told the guy I like a little sweet talk first.
Mobley Heights is just past Palmdale.
there's lots of black folks.
not exactly a paradise for a white supremacist.
I worked a case down there last year.
tons of storage facilities.
all right, so he's not living there.
he's using it for storage.
I'll call for a search warrant.
ISAAC: What were you planning on doing with all the C-4
we found in your storage locker, Jake?
I'm in construction.
ran out of blasting caps.
except C-4's illegal.
blasting caps aren't.
guess you're gonna have to fine me.
we're gonna do a lot more than that.
nice to see affirmative action is alive and well in L. A. County.
another crack like that, you'll be spitting teeth.
how about calling off your Doberman?
sorry, he's not trained.
so pay attention.
dead cop.
death sentence.
whoa. What are you trying to pin on me here?
capital murder.
what?
two counts.
wait, hold on, I didn't kill nobody.
the C-4 you bought has the same chemical signature as the explosives sold by Amir Khan.
a chemical signature is just like a fingerprint.
which ties you to Khan's stash house where two cops died.
you got the wrong guy.
I don't anything about any dead cops.
even if you didn't fire the gun or light the fuse, we've got you on conspiracy and felony murder.
no way!
any more affirmative action jokes?
look, all I did was buy the stuff.
from Khan.
who knows?
I posted an ad on this internet forum, looking for C-4.
someone referred me to an 800 number.
talked to this guy a few times.
wired the money.
dude mailed me the key to a locker at Union Station.
ISAAC: You lie to us, your racist ass gets rung up for murder.
I'm not lying.
I never met this guy Khan.
I was never in any stash house.
and I didn't kill nobody!
how things play out with Forman?
well, the good news is we got the C-4 he bought off the streets.
what was he going to do with it?
probably clearing ground for a new synagogue.
all right, here's the $64, 000 question:
does he get us to Khan? No.
:So where does that leave our case?
in the dumper.
and Berlinger moved to enjoin our investigation.
so what do we do now?
drink heavily. Mmm.
we just got word.
Khan's on his Gulfstream at the Van Nuys Airport.
he's unloaded his C-4, got his money, now he's looking to put as much distance between himself and California as possible.
that plane takes off, the C. I.'s little girl is history.
call the Control Tower, tell them to keep Khan grounded.
already done. You coming?
I'll meet you there.
good.
I vouched for you, Emilio.
and all you've done is lie.
my daughter's life is at stake.
he took Flora.
he works for Khan.
harkin is dead.
what?
Yeah, the stash house that you sent us to?
a bomb went off.
another cop is dead, too, and we're holding you accountable.
no, no.
I didn't know anything about a bomb.
it's over.
do you understand?
I'm sorry.
Tarver gave me no choice.
Oh, so now Tarver's pulling the strings?
no, we're done listening to you, Emilio.
first you put it on Harkin.
now you're putting it on Tarver.
you've done nothing but lie.
no.
you can check, okay?
I saw,
I saw Khan give Tarver money.
and Tarver gave me this.
if you were doing Tarver's bidding, why'd you take us to court, try to get out of this?
I thought if I no longer worked for you, then I'd be useless to Khan.
and he would let Flora go.
but it didn't work.
and now Tarver is going to kill my little baby.
stark: Come on, let us through, come on.
get the media back.
speak!
right.
that was Raina.
Perez is putting it on Tarver.
they ran Tarver's accounts.
guy's worth two and a half mil.
come on, man, answer the phone.
BERLINGER: You have ten minutes to clear out.
then I bring in a Marine division and place anyone who interferes under arrest.
how's that?
Yeah.
Casey's still not answering. Keep trying.
DEVLIN: We don't know for sure anything's happened to him.
look, Tarver killed his own partner, Jess.
he tried to blow us up.
smart money says he's holding Casey and Flora hoage somewhere at Khan's behest.
control Tower says Khan still won't answer his radio.
and why should he? What do we got on him? Only one who can tie him to anything is the dirty cop we can't find.
I understand him grabbing the girl.
but why Casey?
insurance.
but when that plane takes off, hostages become witnesses.
and expendable.
so we gotta figure out a way to get Khan to call Tarver off.
and arrest Khan before the Feds arrest us.
all in the next...
nine minutes.
piece of cake.
Hi.
I'm Casey.
you Flora?
I'm friends with your daddy.
I know this is really scary, but I promise everything's going to be okay.
TARVER: That money was supposed to be wired two hours ago.
call me as soon as the bank receives it.
waiting for the money Khan was supposed to pay you?
is paying me.
you can use it to hire a really good lawyer.
you killed two cops.
you're going down.
actually, I'm going up.
I'm leaving the country on Khan's plane tonight.
this time tomorrow, I'll be in Marbella drinking a mojito.
just one problem.
Khan's leaving the country today.
he's not taking you.
and he's not paying you.
shut up.
he cleared a flight pattern to Lucerne for this afternoon.
he's hanging you out to dry.
if you don't believe me, call him.
your boys are listening in to Khan's calls.
you trying to play me.
you worked us for six months.
fed us false information about Khan's movements, the phony buy...
I got damn well paid for it, too.
how much you get paid for killing your partner?
ray got curious, started sniffing around.
I didn't have a choice.
look, you got what you needed from Emilio, let the little girl go.
it's been a real nice conversation, but it's over now.
open your mouth again...
I'll put a bullet in it.
time's up. What's it going to be?
I just have one question.
why does the federal government want to give a pass to a guy who's implicated in two cop killings?
you don't have the evidence to tie Khan to anything, let alone murder.
we know how to build a case.
and we know how to make it stick.
we have witnesses who'll flip on Khan.
he'll be convicted.
that's not going to work for us.
why the hell not? I'm not having this discussion.
you don't want him taken in, do you?
do you?
Mr. Khan is a very important asset.
which means what?
he's led us to Al Qaeda strongholds...
taliban operatives. Oh.
we need him in the field.
you lying... you...
you were never building a case against Khan.
you were just riding herd on us, weren't you? Keeping tabs, making sure
HOPING-- we would fail.
the Bureau runs things on a need-to-know basis.
now you need to know.
well, here's what you need to know.
I got a D. D. A. and an eight-year-old girl whose lives hang in the balance.
I am not signing two death warrants so you can protect some spy.
the War on Terror is bigger than any two lives, Stark.
listen, you got Khan's C-4 off your streets.
take a victory lap. Walk away.
I'm gonna take a walk all right.
watch this.
stark! What's he doing?
I don't know.
stark, get back here.
shoot me.
Amir, this is Sebastian Stark.
if you talk to me, I give you my word my men will neither harm you nor arrest you.
this thing can end right now.
you can be in the air in five minutes.
you are becoming quite a nuisance, Mr. Stark.
but if this conversation will end our business...
here's the deal.
you have a man on your payroll named Detective Willy Tarver.
he's holding two people hostage.
I want them released unharmed.
if you make this happen,
I promise I will protect you from the U. S. government.
this is nonsense.
I have evidence linking you to the murder of two Los Angeles police officers.
you are bluffing. You see the press over there?
I just gave them a statement to that effect.
good for you.
fine. Take off.
just know the feds are going to shoot you out of the sky the second this plane crosses into open waters.
you gave me your word I would not be harmed.
I told you my men would not harm you.
but my men are no longer in control.
but I can offer you a way out.
or you can just take your chances in the friendly skies.
I'm listening.
release the hostages and confess to federal weapons violations.
now I will tell the press that I was wrong, that you had absolutely nothing to do with the dead cops.
once the feds don't have to fear bad PR, they rescind your death sentence.
but I still go to jail.
a slap on the wrist.
beats a casket.
what's it gonna be?
I lease a warehouse on Washington and Clover.
there have been several break-ins recently.
I cannot be sure what's in there.
I'm turning on my voice recorder.
I want you to repeat after me.
I, Amir Khan, have imported and manufactured plastic explosives in violation of Title 18 of the U. S. Code.
speak.
I, Amir Khan, have imported and manufactured plastic explosives in violation of Title 18 of the U. S. Code.
Mr. Khan has just confessed to violation of federal explosives law.
I have a recording of him doing so.
he would now like to be taken into custody in your protection.
this is Stark.
I need a SWAT team sent to the following address.
okay.
we may have a location for Detective Tarver.
and Flora? We hope so.
I'm coming.
we can't allow that.
she's my daughter; I'm coming with you.
let's go.
take me instead.
shut up.
Tarver just went out the back. He's got the girl.
I need an ambulance!
I need an ambulance!
Khan'll get five to ten, max.
stick him in Club Fed.
conjugal visits, work release, he'll be out in three.
that's three years he won't be dumping explosives on our streets.
martin always said he would be a cop if he had 50 pounds and five more inches.
: Oh, my God...
right
and your cell phone's charged? Because, you know, last time... Dad.
I know you're worried about Wayne Callison, but...
he's a serial killer, Julie, okay?
and he's out there because of me.
you did everything you could.
but he knows where we live and he threatened you.
I know, but...
I still have to live my life.
your date's here. I got it.
fine, but I'm driving.
you think this is how I want to spend my Saturday night?
I really appreciate it. No problem.
I found a guy to take over, Neil Donovan.
I worked private security with him.
is he good? He's the best.
he specializes in young women with stalker problems.
expensive? Big time.
he's hired. Oh, Brandon Crawford's dead.
this should be ugly. All right, let's go.
sorry, pal, you have mall duty.
Crawford's the biggest commercial real estate developer in Southern California.
not anymore.
maid said he's going through a nasty divorce.
we should talk to the wife.
among others.
look, not to speak ill of the dead, but it's not like Brandon Crawford has a lot of fans in this town.
he was investigated by the State Attorney General's Office, wasn't he?
several times, they couldn't touch him.
a lot of skeletons buried under those huge office towers of his.
who else lives here?
Crawford's 16-year-old son, Dylan.
the wife moved out last month.
no forced entry, looks like they wiped the area clean.
one to the chest, exit wound suggests a high-caliber weapon.
proving once again that all the money in the world can't make you bulletproof.
where is he? Where's my dad?
wait, wait, wait.
who did this?
who'd want to kill my father?
in Crawford's case, you might want to start with who wouldn't want to kill him?
probably a shorter list.
four years?
kind of a long time between vacations.
what are you, a travel agent?
I'm just saying, you've been working pretty hard.
you seem kind of tense.
I was born tense.
it works for me.
it's been a rough couple of months with Martin's death and the Callison case.
you should take a week or two, go relax.
since when do you care about my mental health?
you know, I could order you to go.
but you won't.
Really? Why not?
because we've got a dead billionaire and no solid leads.
but feel free to bill me for the session.
the bullet that killed Brandon Crawford came from a . 357 at close range.
anyone in the Crawford household own a gun?
nothing registered, police get a statement from the son?
Yeah, he says he was with friends at City Walk when he got word.
model student, runs cross country...
we should check out the alibi, talk to his friends. I don't know.
you should have seen him at the crime scene-- he was devastated.
report says Crawford had charcoal residue on his fingertips.
the coroner ruled out powder burns.
maybe Crawford liked to barbecue.
and Brandon Crawford does not strike me as a tailgate party type.
I have a list of business rivals.
I'll run them down. What about the ex-wife?
Sonya Crawford, and she's not an ex yet.
no, according to tabloids, they were on and off.
that's your resource? Us Magazine?
Hey, when it comes to celebrity breakups, that's the bible.
stark should talk to her.
he speaks fluent ex-wife.
is bronzing the third or fourth stage of grief?
yes?
Sebastian Stark, Raina Troy.
we're with the DA's Office.
may we ask you a few questions?
we can take this inside if you like?
I've got nothing to hide.
clearly.
so you told the police that you were home watching TV the night of the murder.
project Runway, alone.
I have no alibi. Next.
did your husband have any business conflicts, anyone making threats?
look, you don't get rich without pissing a lot of people off.
and Brandon was very rich.
how is Dylan's relationship with his father?
well, maybe you should ask Dylan. We will.
what about the first wife? Lynn?
she married up. Some duke in England.
she and Brandon haven't spoken in years.
so Dylan is the sole heir?
Yes.
three months ago you were quoted in the New York Post saying, "Widow Sonya Crawford has a nice ring to it.
Oh, yes.
I also said Brandon should die in a fire.
funny how that didn't make it in.
I can't imagine why you two were splitting up.
listen, I know I'm a suspect.
Brandon and I were having our ups and downs, but we were trying to work it out.
but if I wanted to kill Brandon,
I would have at least waited until April 15th.
and why's that? Wedding anniversary?
our fifth wedding anniversary, after which, the prenup Brandon made me sign would have been null and void.
and you would have gotten half his estate.
so I had plenty of incentive to keep our marriage going.
and I would have made it, too, if some psychopath hadn't killed him.
you want to see me murder someone?
catch the guy who did this.
and you wonder why I'm single.
so you were Dylan's advisor?
actually, I teach fine art.
also, I'm the faculty advisor on the school's art club, and that's how I got to know Dylan.
I'm telling you, there's no way in the world he was involved in his father's death.
any idea how the two of them got along?
um, I think Dylan respected his dad.
although, the two of them had very different priorities.
how so?
Dylan's a gifted artist.
it's rare to find a student at his age so committed and talented.
but his father wasn't supportive.
was that a source of tension?
Yeah, Dylan's sensitive.
he wanted his dad's approval.
I think in his heart he knew he wasn't gonna get it.
according to Dylan's records, he dropped art class.
Yeah, his father told him it was a waste of time.
that he had no intention of subsidizing an artist.
has Dylan started drawing again since his father died?
Dylan drew this of me yesterday.
what was that drawn with?
charcoal.
boy: His dad was always pushing.
Dylan would win a race and his dad would get on him about not beating his last time.
it was messed up.
did he ever talk about hurting his dad?
what do you mean?
you know, threats?
we really need to know.
there was this one time,
Dylan was saying how he wished his dad kept a gun in the house.
he said he might buy one for himself.
did he say why? Yeah, to kill either himself or his father, whichever one came first.
we all thought he was joking. Okay.
isaac is not gonna be with you anymore.
thank God.
got you a new guy.
please tell me you're kidding.
just for a while.
define a while.
until Wayne Callison is dead or in jail.
that could take years.
dad, I'm worried about you.
I carry a gun in my car.
that's not what I meant.
you seem really stressed out.
this conversation isn't helping any.
it was just another case.
dad... I got a warrant petition to review.
your Honor, Dylan Crawford told his friends at Flint wood Prep he wanted to buy a gun.
any record to indicate he actually purchased one?
no.
the victim died from a gunshot wound.
didn't the police search the house for firearms?
Yes, but they didn't find anything.
maybe they should have looked harder.
it's still a crime scene.
actually, it isn't.
the second the police left the Crawford home it reverted back to a private residence.
you want a warrant?
show probable cause.
we also ve Dylan's friends on record.
he told them he hated his dad.
just like every other 16-year-old boy on the planet.
just ask my husband.
anything besides the gun and the charcoal pencils?
then I can't sign a search warrant.
it's called probable cause.
they mentioned it in law school.
come back when you have it.
dad messes up junior's art work.
junior blows him away.
the dreaded, irate artist theory.
at least we give the jury a good laugh.
maybe this will help.
hiker found a . 347 magnum in Fry man Canyon.
there's also a boot print.
the crime lab's casting it.
fry man is where the Flint wood cross country team trains.
think we can get a warrant now?
maybe for a limited search, but we need the whole house.
how do we get it?
by appealing to an estranged wife's basic instincts.
if a judge won't let you in to the house, how can I?
because, at the time of his death, you were not yet legally divorced from Brandon.
which means, you're still a resident of the house and can give us permission to enter.
I don't know.
it feels like I'm betraying my stepson.
if Dylan's innocent, you got nothing to worry about.
but if he isn't, intestate succession gives you about 150 million good reasons to let us search that house.
are you suggesting I trade my stepson's freedom for Brandon's estate
I would never be that crass.
the dead bolt sticks a little.
wait, go back.
there are three pages torn out.
and that ain't charcoal.
blood? Mm-hmm.
which will put whatever was on that pad in the middle of the murder.
take a look at this.
these boots were strolling in the canyon where we found the gun.
is it enough to charge Dylan?
I don't know, you've got to figure there's a ton of boots that look like that.
that's a $500 Nicholas Pojay half boot.
you can only get those in Milan.
you will not find another person hiking through the mud in Fry man Canyon wearing those bad boys.
well, let's try it on Cinderella.
if it fits...
okay, there's such a thing as too eager.
the mud on the boots matches the soil in Fry man Canyon.
love it.
there's a ballistics match between the gun and the slug found in Brandon Crawford.
and it gets better.
the bullet from the . 357 matches the ones used in a liquor store robbery in San Diego last summer.
according to Dylan's calendar, he was in San Diego the week after for an art show.
he could have bought the gun from a robber.
find out if they arrested anyone for that robbery.
now, let's talk motive.
money?
Dylan was set for life, even if his dad lived.
abuse. His father wouldn't let him study art, yelled at him in front of his teammates.
if every father got shot for yelling at his son, there'd only be Mother's Day.
sketch pad?
stark: The smudges we found were Brandon Crawford's blood, but we still don't know what was on the missing three pages.
charcoal was found on the victim's fingertips.
whatever Dylan was drawing on that pad was in his father's hand when he was killed.
did Dylan take them?
I don't know, but I want to see if there's a discernible image pressed onto the blank pages.
like a gravestone rubbing?
electrostatic detection.
what the hell is that?
Oblique... Oblique light is flashed onto the furrows of indented writing.
it's an expensive procedure, but very effective.
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.
Dylan Crawford fired a slug from a . 357 magnum to his father.
he deserves to be tried as an adult.
now, which psychiatrist did we draw for the fitness interview?
Dr. William Prosk.
that is not good.
PROSK: Did you ever consider harming your father?
I loved my father.
I understand. I got mad at him sometimes, but I didn't shoot him.
do you think you understand the difference between right and wrong?
I understand that my dad is dead.
and instead of finding whoever killed him, you're wasting your time talking to me.
it'll be tough to convince a judge to let us try Dylan as an adult.
he's only 16.
he shot his father from six feet away with a cannon.
the father left him 150 million bucks.
I want this little bastard put away for life.
my mom left me when I was five.
now my dad is dead.
and I'm not too sure what I'm going to do now.
what does that mean?
you telling me you buy this load of crap?
this kid's the third Menendez brother.
I disagree.
so what's your assessment?
he's a confused boy who doesn't know...
who would badmouth his father to anyone who would listen, bought a gun, and blew a hole in Daddy's chest.
that doesn't mean he should be tried as an adult.
so are you saying that he didn't know what he was doing?
Dylan's a textbook adolescent.
his unresolved issues with an absent mother have led...
thank you, Dr. Phil.
every time I draw you on a case, Bill, every time, you pull this stuff.
do you know, out of 13 teenage defendants, you've recommended trial as an adult, exactly what? Uh, never.
unlike you,
Dylan Crawford has major self-esteem issues.
he's impressionable and easily manipulated.
he was raised by nannies, fed by cooks, delivered by drivers.
he should be tried as a minor.
and you should be tried for impersonating a shrink.
you have a real way with people.
Prosk is a moron.
but you know what?
he brings up an interesting point.
would a kid like Dylan have the stones to commit murder on his own?
you think he had help?
well, he hangs out with rich kids, right?
rich, bored, looking for trouble.
like the Billionaire Boys Club?
change of plans. With Prosk testifying, the fitness hearing is a definite loser.
let's take a closer look at Dylan Crawford's Beverly Hills homeboys.
boy: Julie, you're complaining about a B plus? Come on.
I knew that stuff cold.
bomberg just hates me. What did you get?
well, I sure as hell didn't get a B plus.
yeah? Let me see.
Hey. Hey, hey! That's highly classified.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
give it to me. Let me see.
you're complaining? You know what, You...
you're teasing me when you got an "A"?
you give that back to me right n... You give that...!
Hey, come on, come on, come on.
is everything okay here, Julie?
who are you? I'm Neil Donovan.
your dad hired me to look out for you. Are you okay?
I will be as soon as you let go of my friend.
I'm sorry, Craig. It's okay.
I'll talk to you later.
uh, your dad didn't tell you I'd be picking you up?
Yeah, he just forgot to mention that you'd be assaulting my friend in front of the entire school.
LAPD imaged Dylan's laptop and server.
there's nothing to suggest that he was looking for help to kill his dad.
not helpful.
but he has a Yahoo account he uses on a computer in the school library.
And?
he was involved in an intimate e-mail relationship.
among other things, he revealed details f his lousy relationship with his dad.
who's his pen pal?
his art teacher?
she thinks he's a prodigy.
seems like they were pretty close.
Dylan drew her portrait.
she has it up in the art room. Mm.
sounds like she was teaching him to do more than draw.
but the e-mails aren't explicitly sexual.
suggestive, maybe.
probably took care of the sexual part outside of cyberspace.
huh. Teacher falls for student.
teacher has sex with student?
student's father finds out, threatens teacher.
teacher buys silence with a gun.
find out everything you can about Ellie Davis
including why there were never teachers like that when I was in high school.
MADELEINE: There are 264 e-mails from you to Dylan Crawford.
I'm his teacher.
right here on January 6, you wrote "I want to wrap my arms around you.
I want to make everything okay.
his father was just murdered.
I wanted to comfort him, give him a hug, that's all.
you discussed his social life, talked about girls, exchanged poetry?
he needed someone to talk to.
his mother's gone, he couldn't relate to his father.
I don't see what's wrong with that.
why would you use your personal account rather than the school computer?
okay.
I admit what I was doing might be seen as inappropriate.
but I was only doing it because I care about Dylan.
he's a talented student, and a wonderful person.
he has no one.
he needs to be nurtured.
I-I was...
nurturing him?
RAINA: The art club stayed at the San Diego Shore Mont
what's going on with the thug who robbed the liquor store?
Quentin North, career criminal.
they just transferred him to San Diego Central Jail.
good. You and Raina head down there and see if this guy sold his gun to Dylan Crawford or anyone else, and check out the Shoremont.
okay, you and I are going back to Dylan Crawford.
see what it's like to be teacher's pet.
don't take this the wrong way, Dylan, but you don't look so hot.
you accuse me of killing my dad, stick me in this place...
if you're here to talk a plea, just start talking.
hmm. Okay.
you in love with Ellie Davis?
what?
she was your teacher.
you wrote love notes back and forth on the Internet.
you did drawings of her.
your old man find out?
did he find one of the drawings?
guys do crazy things when they're in love.
cause see, I don't think you killed your dad on your own.
I think someone you... you trusted, someone in a position of power over you took advantage.
someone you admired.
I'm giving you a chance to help yourself.
take it.
when Ellie and I were down in San Diego...
she bought a gun.
Why?
she was worried about my dad's temper.
she wanted to protect me.
when we got back to L. A. we went to my house.
I was sketching her.
stark: And your dad came home.
Ellie was naked.
my dad freaked out, said he was gonna call the police, have her arrested.
she ran out and, um...
when she came back, she was holding the gun.
she shot him.
Ellie Davis killed your father?
she was scared.
my dad was threatening her.
I don't think she even meant to pull the trigger.
she's a good person.
I don't want to hurt her.
you did the right thing, Dylan.
tell Ellie I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll pass that on.
woman: She was trying to help Dylan.
she cared about him. She didn't do this.
no alibi, the provocative e-mails, the trips out of town.
Carla, come on. I know how this looks.
but I wasn't sleeping with Dylan, and I had nothing to do with his father's death.
then why is he trying to throw you under the bus?
I don't know.
my client has no criminal record.
she's received several teaching awards.
she's active in the community.
stark: She may not have a record, Carla, but she's definitely got a past.
what are you talking about?
rule number one, Miss Davis.
always tell your defense attorney everything.
juniper Pines Boys Academy--does that ring a bell?
this isn't the first time your client has gotten cozy with a student.
no. Former student, and he was of age when we were together.
well, I doubt the jury is going to make a big distinction there.
we got you.
so what are we doing here?
Dylan really cares about you.
and I would prefer not to put him through a trial.
plead to second degree murder.
I will try to convince the judge to go easy.
No!
I won't confess to something I didn't do.
fine, teach art classes at Valley State Prison.
Ellie, I think you should at least... Yeah, I said no!
I'm innocent!
I have devoted my life to teaching art to these kids.
and I've devoted my life to jury trials.
and in the courtroom, I got to warn you,
I'm Michelangelo.
can I help you?
Yeah, here to see, uh, Quentin North, Booking Number 113.
regarding a gun he used in a liquor store robbery.
sorry, inmate got stabbed, we're on lockdown.
no visitors.
when do you think you'll come off lockdown?
it's tough to say.
probably not till the morning.
hmm.
you ever been to Sea World?
Ellie Davis is pleading not guilty.
we're going after her for murder.
Dylan is now our key witness.
you sure you have enough to prosecute?
Yes, and I'm going to get more.
Oh, I saw.
15 grand for electrostatic enhancement.
Dylan was sketching when his dad came in.
if we can determine that Ellie Davis was his subject, that puts her at the murder scene.
I drew the Eiffel Tower last night. Doesn't mean I was in Paris.
okay, circumstantial, granted, but it helps the jury picture our theory.
the innocent kid, the sexy naked teacher.
smells like... victory.
smells thin.
you've got no independent witness, no time line on...
details.
you're moving too fast.
man, I lose one case, and you put me on a short leash.
this has nothing to do with the Callison case.
then let me do my job.
man: The impression was compromised, but the pressure points on the eyes, nose and mouth did come through.
can you work off that?
facial feature detection can extrapolate to the missing facial features on the details of the major regions.
I've heard about this before.
homeland Security is using it.
that's comparing people with photographs.
this is a sketch.
an artist's interpretation of how someone looks.
it's your call.
is it expensive? Oh, yeah.
we should call Stark.
and what do you think he's going to say?
go for it. Cool.
peace offering.
just so we're clear...
note to self--don't attack Julie's classmates.
Yeah. Look,
I know this is a tough adjustment...
I don't want to adjust, but until I can talk my dad off the ledge,
I have to put up with you, but I don't have to like it.
fair enough.
chicken parmesan sub from Earth, Wind and Flower?
how did you know?
that's why I get the big bucks.
you want some?
no, thanks.
you didn't work up an appetite abusing my friend?
I don't eat that stuff.
though I used to when I was your age.
and when was that?
I'm 24.
you look younger.
well, that's 'cause I watch what I eat.
you could have warned me.
it's a whale show.
you didn't think we'd get wet?
I feel like somebody dumped a big old fish tank on me.
come on, I got you a dolphin, didn't I?
Yeah, you got me the dolphin, yeah. Thanks.
well, this is me.
you want to come in?
maybe bust open some macadamia nuts?
Thanks, but I have a report to do.
Oh, come on.
you sure?
we can chase them down with some tiny bottles of champagne.
rain check.
is it the Shamu smell?
Mm-hmm.
I'll see you in the morning.
okay, good night.
stark: Dylan, you said you had a sexual relationship with Ellie Davis.
is that correct?
Yes.
and when did this sexual relationship with the defendant start?
Ellie asked me to draw her, um, portrait.
without her clothes?
Yes.
go on.
it made me uncomfortable, but she was my advisor, and I like her a lot.
so I went along with it.
did it stop there?
no.
during the session, she came up to where I was working.
and what did she do?
she kissed me.
and then she started taking off my clothes.
and you had sex?
Yes.
did your relationship continue?
um, we got together whenever we could.
um, her office, my car.
she'd come over to the house when my dad was out of town.
thank you, Dylan.
nothing further.
you sketched my client nude, is that correct? Yes.
and you had sex with her repeatedly? That's right.
so then let me ask you a simple question.
what does Ellie Davis look like naked?
objection. Vague and irrelevant.
all goes to credibility.
this alleged sexual relationship is key to the prosecution's case.
I will allow it, but counselor, let's try to keep it PG-13.
what did Ellie look like without her clothes on?
I'm not sure what you want me to say.
well, was there something distinctive about her body? A scar, or a birthmark?
Dylan: Um... I-I, um...
I can't, can't really remember.
it was dark usually when we did it.
Oh, you draw in the dark?
Oh, Your Honor, may we have a recess please?
denied.
the witness will answer.
look, I don't remember anything specific.
I would like this marked Defense Exhibit 22
and Defense Exhibit 23.
it's a picture of my client, partially disrobed.
her lower right hip visible.
thank you.
do you see this tattoo?
Yes.
you claimed to have drawn my client's nude body, and to have made love to her repeatedly, and yet you haven't seen her tattoo until this moment.
so Dylan, either you are the least observant adolescent male on this planet, or you're lying through your teeth.
you going to wear that to the jail?
well, that's all they had at the gift shop.
at least I changed my clothes.
did you sleep okay?
not really. You?
no.
Hey, you look fine.
wait a second.
you should never leave your key card behind.
right.
I'm looking at a third strike on this liquor store beef.
the gun's involved in a murder case in L. A.
now if we charge you as an accomplice...
that's capital murder, Quentin. The death penalty.
third strike is sounding better all the time.
you help us out, we'll put a call in to the San Diego DA.
I sold the piece a week after the robbery.
to?
some white chick, kind of hot.
I was pretty wasted.
I should have dumped it.
but 200 bucks is 200 bucks.
how did you hook up with this woman?
a buddy of mine is a valet parker.
met this chick, had a couple of drinks.
she asked him where she could buy a piece, no questions asked.
is that the woman?
I don't know. Like I said... You were wasted.
Yeah. We're going to need to speak with your friend.
he had a bit of a run-in with his girlfriend.
it was ugly.
he boosted a car from the valet stand.
good luck finding him.
great.
the valet parker, where'd he work?
the Shore Mont, Mission Bay.
you're the guy who brings me good news, Philip.
I took the vectors from the sketch and overlaid them on the pictures of photos of interest file as you'll see here.
is not a match.
okay, so I fork out 25 G's for a high-tech Etch-A-Sketch, and you can't find me a match.
like I said, there were other photos in the file.
you...
just picked the wrong one.
Dylan was sketching her nude and his father walked in. Lucky bastard.
think he was just sketching her?
have you seen Sonya Crawford?
he wasn't sleeping with Ellie Davis, he was sleeping with... With his stepmom, which means we get to mount an entirely new case mid-trial and I get to let another killer go free this month.
I'm on a roll.
nice work, Phillip.
thank you.
Sonya Crawford let us search the house.
why would she do that if she was sleeping with the kid?
she didn't want to be a suspect.
she figured the drawings were destroyed, we wouldn't find anything, but she was wrong.
wasn't she trying to stay married until after the prenup expired?
Crawford's divorce lawyer told me that the papers were ready to sign.
which means that Sonya was never going to see half of that estate.
so she seduces Dylan and convinces him they need to get rid of his father.
it couldn't have been too tough a job because Dylan and the old man didn't get along, and I have seen Sonya Crawford in a bathing suit.
Dylan gets the entire estate and shares it with his new girlfriend.
only in L. A.
okay, but you still have to actually prove it.
I mean, electrostatic composite?
you know that if evidence isn't from a generally accepted field of science...
that's what they said about fingerprinting and DNA.
you rushed Ellie Davis to trial.
because the evidence pointed to her, Jess.
it was a shot in the dark
you lost a big case, now you're trying to make up for it with this one, and people are getting hurt.
I can't listen to this crap again.
look, you want to build a case against Sonya Crawford using real evidence, be my guest.
but I want Ellie Davis released today.
what do you mean, we're not releasing her? ??
it's only for a couple more days. Ellie Davis
it's against the law to keep her locked up if we know that she...
do you want to win this case or not?
and what if she kills herself?
or didn't you learn anything from Janet Butler?
I put Janet Butler on the stand to convict a serial killer.
I would do it again in a second.
if you don't like it, there's the door.
now, here's the deal.
if we accuse Sonya, she's going to hire a big-time lawyer and clam up.
we might not have enough to charge her.
but as long as Sonya thinks that we're still going after Ellie, and that she's just a witness...
we can blindside her on the stand? Right.
but we still need to put Sonya in San Diego, buying the murder weapon from Quentin North.
I want you to check everything
credit cards, cell phones, toll roads
and get Quentin North up here.
I sent a JPEG of Sonya to North's public defender.
north couldn't I. D. her as the woman who bought the gun.
I don't care. Get him up here.
is there a problem?
no.
keeping a wrongly-accused person behind bars is dead wrong.
we play along, we're as bad as he is.
would you prefer Sonya and Dylan get away with murder?
I don't know. Maybe.
so what's the plan?
I thought you were out.
I walked out on him, not on you guys.
if Sonya was in San Diego, she did a hell of a job covering her tracks.
never even used her cell phone.
don't be fooled by the collagen-- Sonya's smart.
hello.
okay. Tell him I'll be right down.
I ordered Chinese.
it's 1: 00 in the morning.
Yeah. Exactly.
what's this?
it's a hotel key from San Diego.
must have been a fun night.
we need to find Sebastian.
and then I noticed Dylan would drive with Miss Davis to various art galleries and exhibits.
God knows what happened in San Diego. Objection.
calls for speculation.
sustained. Did you attend Dylan's art show in San Diego, Miss Crawford?
no.
in hindsight, maybe I should have.
do you know what this is, Miss Crawford?
uh... looks like a hotel key. Correct.
it is Exhibit H for the People, Your Honor.
and you see this part on the back here?
do you have any idea what's on that magnetic stripe?
I assume it lets you into the room. Right.
the thing is-- and I didn't know this, by the way
it also stores all sorts of other information, including your credit card number.
so don't ever leave your key card behind because you could become a victim of identity theft.
thank you for the public service announcement.
you're welcome, Your Honor. Yes. Do you have a question for this witness?
Yes, Your Honor. Indeed I do.
miss Crawford, when you registered at the Shore Mont Hotel, why did you pay cash, sign in under an assumed name, and then agree to leave an imprint of your credit card?
I don't know what you're talking about.
maybe you were planning on trashing the room or looting the minibar.
judge: Miss Crawford, you don't have to answer these questions, you are not on trial here.
miss Crawford, do you recognize this gentleman?
would you stand up, sir?
I've never seen him before. Really?
well, would you recognize him if he were, say, just hypothetically, selling you a . 357 caliber handgun?
would that jog your memory?
Hey, I'd like to call my lawyer.
good idea. Recess until 2: 00.
one more question, Your Honor.
Mr. Stark, court is in recess.
miss Crawford, did you or did you not forge a romantic relationship with Dylan Crawford, your stepson, That's enough.
in order to avoid being cut out of your husband's estate?
that's enough!
with Dylan until he was 18, and then share in all the dough. Am I getting close?
Mr. Stark, you're getting dangerously close to contempt.
did you, or did you not conspire to kill Brandon Crawford and blame it on Ellie Davis? That's it!
Mr. Stark, you're in contempt.
Bailiff's, take him into custody.
go on. Get it over with.
no, I am very upset.
great, yuck it up.
I need you to release Ellie Davis, and issue a statement of factual innocence to the press.
I'm way ahead of you.
I laid out the case pretty good for you in there.
Dylan and Sonya are teed up for a plea.
just handle it. It's no problem.
are you okay?
not my first rodeo.
just get me on the early bus to County. Why?
I don't want to miss dinner.
tuesday's lasagna night.
go on.
my dad reached you?
Yeah. Guess he's spending the night in jail.
you don't sound surprised.
you don't know my dad.
he asked me to make sure you're okay until tomorrow.
come on in.
that's okay.
I'll be out in the car.
you have my cell number if you need anything.
that's ridiculous.
you can't sleep in the car.
occupational hazard.
okay, well, at least come in and let me make you some dinner.
I bought some of that gross lotus root stuff that you eat.
it's tough to pass up lotus root.
okay.
you've got nothing on my client.
the fact she was in San Diego...
and lied about it under oath.
Congratulations.
misdemeanor perjury.
Quentin North is ready to testify that he sold Sonya the gun.
the word of a felon.
against the word of a liar and a child molester.
Dylan: She's not a child molester.
I love her, and she loves me.
shut up, Dylan.
DEVLIN: It's all right, Dylan.
tell us what happened.
Dylan was sketching me,
Brandon walked in on us.
he freaked out, started screaming.
he came toward us, then...
then Dylan shot him.
look, I slept with Dylan a few times, it was no big deal.
that's not true.
you said you loved me. Yeah.
I said a lot of things, and then there's reality.
you can't rely on anything he says.
he's a child.
she wanted me to kill him.
Dylan... She said we couldn't be together while my dad was still alive.
okay, that's a lie!
Sonya bought the gun.
I was hoping I could talk her out of it, but... my dad came home early and caught us.
you shot your father, Dylan?
I was trying to protect Sonya.
Oh, please.
you hated him as much as I did. All right. Enough.
Dylan, 15 years.
don't think for a minute I won't try you as an adult this time.
Sonya, first degree murder.
25 to life, no death penalty.
but Dylan pulled the trigger.
there wouldn't have been a trigger to pull if she hadn't organized the whole scheme.
a 16-year-old kid.
you're pathetic.
those are the offers.
I hear one word out of anybody, and you'll see me in court.
and you will not like that.
I'm going in, you're coming out.
talk about irony.
I'm very sorry. Really.
what am I supposed to do now?
get back to your life.
you think there's a school in California that would hire me now?
soon as I get out of here, I'll make some phone calls.
you tell me where you want to teach.
I'll make it happen.
can he do that?
he can do that.
I'll talk to Judge Newman.
see if I can calm him down.
Hey, you're the one that said I should get away, take some time off.
so let me ask you.
the guards' nightly poker game on D-block:
what's the buy-in on that?
car handles nice.
Yeah, I've actually never driven 90 miles an hour on Coldwater Canyon before.
you told me to step on it.
luckily, I have a fresh pair of boxers in the trunk.
Hi, are you Garland? Yes.
what have we got? Janet Butler, 28.
motorist spotted her in the middle of the road.
could it be our guy?
somebody did a number on her.
ritualized knife wounds.
very twisted, but since we've never found a body...
can she ID her attacker?
she's in pretty bad shape.
you know, maybe it's better if we wait.
five missing women in a five-mile radius in the past three months.
waiting is not an option.
my name is Sebastian Stark.
I'm with the District Attorney's office.
I don't want to talk.
I understand.
but the thing is,
I need your help.
and if you can remember what happened, it might help someone else.
female victim snatched outside her home in broad daylight.
she was supposed to be number six.
any luck retracing her path?
s. I.D.'s doing what they can.
it appears she escaped on foot, so the suspect may live nearby.
keep this officer posted by her bedside, 24/7.
what, you think he'll come after her?
I doubt it.
this guy hasn't made a mistake yet.
no bodies, no clues.
well, letting her live is a pretty big screwup.
maybe he's throwing us a bone.
you think he let her go on purpose?
I don't know.
but if he wants to get caught, let's not disappoint him.
we may not get another shot.
it's my sad duty to report that Janet Butler died from her wounds early this morning.
is she the sixth victim?
I'll have the LAPD handle the specifics of the case.
the Mayor and the District Attorney have just announced the death of Janet Butler, believed to be the sixth victim of the elusive predator currently terrorizing the Southland.
you're a pretty good liar, Manny.
ever consider running for office?
you better be right?
it's a smart move.
if this bastard thinks he finished the job, he's less likely to go into hiding.
you said he wanted to get caught.
I said maybe. And I'm hoping Janet Butler can lead us to him.
but if not, least he didn't disappear.
Yeah, but if he disappears, he stops killing people.
stark: For now.
but in six months, a year, starts all over again.
so nail him, fast.
you know, eventually, the press is gonna realize she's still alive.
hopefully, not before we find this freak.
you have everything you need?
LAPD, SWAT-- everybody's in place.
just waiting for Janet Butler to lead the way.
I want to help you, really.
but I'm really tired.
when you woke up in this guy's house, you were lying on a table?
it looked like...
some kind of work room.
I was... tied down.
did this guy talk to you?
he never stopped talking.
the stuff he said is...
weird, it was like...
he knew me.
but you'd never seen him before?
he said stuff about my father,
things that there's no way he could know, things that... nobody knows.
how did you get away?
I must have passed out.
when I woke up, I was...untied.
and he was across the room.
he had some kind of knife in his hand.
and there was a...pipe on the floor.
I grabbed it.
and when he came over,
I pretended that I was still unconscious.
and I just took and hit him with the pipe as hard as I could.
I ran.
and you told the police you saw a red Saab parked outside his house?
there was a..."P" on the license plate.
I could hardly see.
I was just trying to get away.
you've been a great help, Janet.
we're gonna catch this guy.
I won't have to testify, right?
hopefully, it won't come to that.
because this guy was like...
he was in my head.
I don't ever want to see him again.
anything on the car?
there are 28 red Saabs with the letter "P" registered in the Hollywood Hills area.
anyone jump out?
cops interviewed him a month ago.
his car was spotted in the vicinity when the third victim was snatched.
what's the story? 43, single.
teaches creative writing at Santa Monica State College. Where does he live?
three quarters of a mile from where they found Janet Butler.
Yahtzee. Get a search warrant.
nice work.
ISAAC: Police. Open up.
may I help you gentlemen?
Mr. Calison, my name is...
it's an honor.
did the police tell you I'd be stopping by?
no, no, but I was hoping you would.
why is that?
well, I've followed your career for years.
I'm a big fan.
watch a lot of Court TV, do you?
I'm addicted.
and now you're a prosecutor.
high-profile crimes.
you know, when the detectives started asking me about these poor women who have gone missing,
I thought I might get a chance to meet you.
so, Mr. Calison...
Wayne.
you teach fiction writing...
Wayne?
Yeah. It's probably why I love watching trials on TV.
you know?
each one's a miniature morality play.
good versus evil, heroes and villains.
which one are you, Wayne?
just kidding.
you mention these women that have gone missing.
Oh, yeah, it's all over TV.
it's awful.
you know, we found the last one just a few blocks from your house.
I was shocked.
was she able to tell you anything before she... died?
no.
she was pretty far gone.
we're dealing with a real psychopath, Wayne.
you know the type?
twisted, vicious, no conscience.
Yeah.
it's hard to believe that those kind of people actually exist in the world, isn't it?
we searched every inch of Wayne Calison's home.
there's no blood evidence, no weapons.
there's some sand in the hallway, but otherwise nothing.
I say we hold him for a while, see what we come up with.
no, we'll get more out of this guy if we keep him on the street.
follow him.
if he jaywalks I want to know about it.
that's our guy.
tell me there's a good reason I'm in Hermosa Beach.
s. I.D. analyzed the sand from Wayne Calison's house.
basaltic rock and algae forms specific to the South Bay.
who am I, Jacques Cousteau?
Wayne's younger brother and only living relative.
I figure that sand came from right around here.
well, let's find out.
he wouldn't talk to the police.
he'll talk to me.
got nothing to say.
that's too bad.
we're from the City Planning Commission.
had a shot to make some big bucks.
wait.
Y- you weren't gonna ask me about Wayne?
Wayne who?
you know, the city's considering putting the blue line through here.
you are aware of that, right?
come on.
Yeah, anybody who owns property on this side of the street stands to make big money if they sell.
are you serious?
mind if we check out the property?
uh, I don't get much time to clean up.
good thing we're not with the Health Department.
how long have you lived here?
uh, almost seven years.
nice patio.
Yeah. Yeah.
it must have set you back a few bucks.
Oh, my brother, Wayne, paid for it.
he wanted me to have someplace nice to hang out.
Wayne sounds like a great guy.
Yeah.
uh, he's always looking out for me.
killer patio.
stark: This is a matter of public safety, Your Honor.
it's a matter of the fourth amendment, Mr. Stark.
the city will pay to restore Tommy Calison's property.
that's hardly the point.
you expect me to give you a warrant to dig up this man's property simply because he built a new deck?
no, sir, I expect you to do it because his brother's a serial killer.
then dig up his brother's house.
Oh, wait. You already did that.
and you came up with nothing.
your Honor... I'm sorry.
until you can bring me more,
I can't help you.
let's try another judge. Waste of time.
no one's gonna give us a warrant based on what we have.
so what, we're gonna give up?
am I waving a white flag?
two words: mineral rights.
mineral rights?
property law 101:
unless mineral rights are specifically granted, the land under one's home...
...belongs to the government.
in other words, there's more than one way to dig a hole.
you guys don't mess around.
make sure they don't break the surface of that yard.
if they do, we lose anything we find.
man: Yeah, we're under the deck now.
there's a, uh, crawlspace?
we found a body. Give me a hand with this. I think I see some more.
check that. We have several bodies.
female, various stages of decomposition.
take him.
pick up the brother, too.
we're gonna have to find him first.
I told Isaac to keep an eye on him.
thing is...
isaac sent a text message.
Calison filed a harassment complaint this afternoon.
isaac had to suspend surveillance.
and you were planning on telling me this exactly when?
look, I'm sorry, but it's not like this whole excavation happened by itself.
damn it.
I'll put out an A. P.B. Yeah.
great. He's probably halfway across the country by now.
my dad should be home pretty soon.
you know, I'll never forget the course he taught at USC.
really inspired me.
sounds like you were his best student.
well, like I was saying, he and your mom were going through the divorce at the time and he was pretty broken up, but...
whenever he talked about you, he had such...such love in his eyes. Really?
cause I mean, he wasn't around that much.
what's it like?
having such a brilliant dad?
good.
you know, it's none of my business, but no one gets along with their parents all the time.
well I know he's really trying.
sometimes it's...hard for parents to let their kids grow up.
especially a kid as great as you.
Thanks.
do you have children? Mm.
no.
no. I guess I, um, haven't found the right woman yet.
go upstairs. Oh, hey, Sebastian.
what's wrong? Now.
this is Sebastian Stark.
I want a patrol car at my house right away.
I have Wayne Calison here.
it's a beautiful house.
you deserve it.
we found the bodies.
it's over.
must be great having everything you ever wanted.
why did you do it, Wayne?
why'd you make a fortune letting guilty people go free?
I'm a lawyer.
exactly.
we were all born to do something.
and I'm gonna make sure you die for what you did.
with Janet Butler as your star witness.
Yeah, that was clever saying she was dead- I expected nothing less of you.
except the ME's office didn't do an autopsy.
you slipped up there.
I'll see you in court, Sebastian.
county of Los Angeles v. Wayne Robert Calison.
five counts of murder in the first degree, one count attempted murder in the first degree.
how does the defendant plead?
not guilty, Your Honor.
are the People ready to proceed?
we are, Your Honor.
any further motions?
Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Calison, please address the court through your attorney.
that's exactly the point, Your Honor.
I'd like to represent myself in this trial.
the People strenuously object.
Mr. Calison, the charges against you are quite serious.
competent counsel is critical to your defense.
I understand.
I've prepared a Faretta waiver.
your Honor, the point is, this is a high profile case.
allowing the defendant to act as his own counsel would make a mockery of these proceedings.
well, this waiver looks to be well prepared and in good order.
did you execute this document yourself, Mr. Calison? I did.
just because he can click a mouse and download a form from the internet, doesn't mean he can handle a complex capital murder case.
that may be true, Mr. Stark, but unless you can supply some proof of his mental incapacity,
Mr. Calison's motion is granted.
Calison defending himself sounds like good news to me.
which is why I drive a Mercedes, and you take the bus.
judges and juries root for the underdog.
every time I pound on this guy in court,
I look like a bully and he looks like a victim.
he's a serial killer. He's also smart, manipulative and has zero conscience.
the difference is, I don't have five dead bodies buried under my deck.
Janet Butler said that she really nailed Calison with that pipe, yet there is no record of him seeking medical assistance.
now, the cops found a bruise on his ribs when they booked him.
said he fell off a stepladder.
so find an expert who will testify that the injury is consistent with blunt trauma from a pipe.
already done.
so why are we interviewing his brother again?
I mean, Isaac said that the time cards from his jobs alibi him out for all five murders.
right, but he doesn't know that.
you can have an attorney present.
I got nothing to hide.
you and your brother think a lot alike, Tommy.
family that kills together...
I didn't kill anybody.
you got five corpses buried under your Barcalounger, sport.
you helped Wayne do the killing, or you helped him stash the bodies, or both.
any way you slice it, you're toast.
I didn't do anything wrong.
we want to believe you, but you're going to have to help us out.
you were ten years old when your father died.
how did Wayne handle that?
it's none of your damn business.
trust me, Tommy...
it's his business.
play ball...
which is it?
Wayne took it real hard when Dad died.
he take it out on you?
he took it out on everybody.
before you go, I made you something to eat.
what's the occasion?
let's see.
it's Thursday.
you kept me from getting hacked apart by a lunatic.
the usual.
you were incredibly lucky.
I know. I should never have let him in the door.
you think? You know what I do for a living,
the kinds of people I deal with.
but the way he talked about you...
it was almost like he was an old friend.
I can't believe that guy actually killed people.
trust me, he did.
he just seemed so normal.
if I hadn't come in when I did...
but you did come home.
heard you got Tommy Calison to rollover on his brother.
well, nothing solid on the murders but, evidently, Wayne tortured him for years when they were kids.
by the time Tommy's done testifying,
Wayne's going to make Charlie Manson look like a model citizen.
ccu ran Wayne's hard drive.
did you know this guy has a 184 IQ?
the smarter they are, the freakier they are.
he's also done tons of legal research over the past few months.
he may be nuts, but he's not stupid.
he got BA from USF, Master's from Irvine.
even spent a little time in Mensa.
so you've done your research.
know thy enemy.
apparently, great minds think alike.
tech guys found a file called "Stark."
transcripts of every case you've tried in the past ten years, press clippings and personal information.
what can I say?
guy's got good taste.
the point is, everything this guy knows, he's learned it from you.
finally, a worthy adversary.
between Wayne Calison and Janet Butler?
talk to me.
Janet took a writing course at the Learning Center in Westwood six months ago.
but Calison teaches fiction at Santa Monica State College.
he also teaches night courses at the Learning Center.
that place is great- I took an Art History class there a couple years ago.
excuse me?
I was dating this girl...
art History?
I hope she was hot. Smoking.
but if Jane took a class from Calison, then she would have recognized him.
exactly. Calison wasn't her teacher, but they were there at the same time.
he could have targeted Janet as a victim.
I'd take an Art History class for you right now.
okay.
okay, okay...
try to calm down.
we'll be right there.
we got a problem.
you lied to me.
try to calm down, Janet.
that bastard called me on the phone.
said I have to talk to him because my name is on the DA's Witness list.
you have every right to be upset.
he, he said I'm gonna have to face him in court.
we're doing everything that we can to keep you off the stand.
do you have any idea what it was like hearing his voice?
thinking about what he did to me.
Calison is in jail, Janet.
he can't hurt you.
I don't care.
I want my name off the list.
MADELEINE: He's just trying to scare you, he's desperate.
well, he sure didn't sound like it.
he talked about what he did to me.
what he wanted to do.
did he threaten you?
he talked about my father again.
about the day he died.
I am a good person.
why is he doing this to me?
that stuff about her father had to come from somewhere.
yeah and we have no basis to search his cell.
Oh, ye of little faith.
come to offer me a plea deal?
last rites actually.
open the door.
you seem upset.
you been talking to Janet?
you're a sadistic son of a bitch.
you guys put her on the witness list.
you like to study my moves, Wayne?
check this one out.
place this man under arrest.
you're being charged with witness tampering, Wayne.
you threatened Janet Butler, that's a major no-no.
you're arresting a jailed capital murder suspect for a misdemeanor?
which gives us the right to search his cell for evidence.
pack up those documents, take the laptop.
these materials are privileged.
Where'd you get that, Wayne?
black's law for psychos?
you harassed a witness.
say adios to work product privilege, pal.
copy of a notebook from the Learning Center.
it's got Janet Butler's name on it.
writing From Memory.
the Art of Personal Biography.
you read Janet's journal, Wayne.
that's not very nice, is it?
you ever stop to think that maybe she deserved to be punished?
no.
but you do, Wayne.
and I'm just the guy to do it.
Mr. Calison, you are the defendant's brother. Is that correct?
Yeah.
did you two have a happy childhood?
not really.
why is that?
uh... well, our dad, he...
he didn't treat us very good.
now, your father died when you were ten.
and your brother was 12?
Yeah.
after your dad died, did you brother begin to abuse you, physically?
did you brother abuse you?
no.
no, Wayne and I... got along fine.
in your statement, you describe chronic mental and physical abuse.
is that a lie?
Yeah.
I just...told you what I thought you wanted to hear.
permission to treat the witness as hostile.
granted. Objection.
Mr. Stark made a deal for my brother's testimony, should he not accept the testimony given?
overruled.
isn't it true that your brother terrorized you and your mother?
no. You said, he threatened you with knives.
it never happened. You said, he killed and dismembered animals in the backyard? Those were lies.
they were all lies.
Wayne's my brother, he...
he'd never do that.
judge: You have any further questions for this witness?
no.
cross, Mr. Calison.
okay, Tommy?
Yeah. Answer a few questions?
sure.
Where'd they find the bodies of those five women they claim I killed.
underneath the patio in my backyard.
you see me put them there? No.
you ever hear me speak of any bodies?
never.
wayne: And when Mr. Stark dug under your house and he found those women, who did he have the police place under arrest?
me.
wayne: Did he say why?
Yeah. It was, uh, suspicion of murder.
he's trying to pin this on his brother.
thanks for the update.
you know, when Mr. Stark was asking us about growing up together, it got me thinking.
do you remember Lydia Franklin?
relevance, Your Honor? Mr. Calison, your questions must pertain directly to the issues at hand.
if Mr. Stark will be patient,
I assure the court this is relevant.
I'll give you some latitude, but let's get to the point.
thank you.
so, Tommy,
I don't want to talk about that, Wayne.
she lived next-door to us for 12 years.
did she not accuse you of raping her when she was 15? Your Honor!
sit down, Mr. Stark.
the witness will answer the question.
Y- You said that she liked me, Wayne.
wayne: But I never told you to force yourself on her.
but that was a mistake.
I- I never meant to hurt her.
: it's okay, Tommy.
everyone makes mistakes.
no further questions.
MADELEINE: Isaac's bringing her over.
this is wrong.
you got any better suggestions?
cause without Janet Butler's testimony, all our case is, is a circumstantial house of cards.
his brother screwed us.
Janet's our only shot at a conviction.
not if Calison destroys her on the stand. Thank you.
what, you're going soft now?
it's like a pit bull quoting Gandhi.
stark: When you were lying bound and gagged like an animal in Wayne Calison's house, did he speak to you?
Yes.
now, your private journal was found in his possession.
did he discuss with you material from that journal?
Yes, he...
talked about my father.
stark: Was there a specific incident from your past that he referred to?
I... wrote about the day my father died.
what in particular about that day?
before my... father died, he, um...
he apologized to me.
for what?
I... I'm sorry, I just...
Yes, Janet. Yes, sweet... yes.
we're almost done.
: okay.
why did your father apologize to you?
when I was, um...
a little girl...
my father used to...
come into my room at night.
so your father sexually abused you?
Yes.
and Wayne Calison used this painful, horrible memory to torture and degrade you?
he said that I was a...
a dirty little girl, and...
he was...
gonna punish me for what I, uh...
for what I did.
okay.
you did great.
just great.
now, when Calison cross-examines you,
I want you to be calm.
it's gonna be very hard. Okay.
and, um...
he can ask me anything?
within the parameters of the case, yes.
please...
please, don't make me do this.
I'm sorry...
but you have to.
because if you don't testify, Janet...
Wayne Calison could go free...
and he needs to pay for what he did to you.
and I need to stop him from doing it to anybody else.
miss Butler, you testified that the man who attacked you repeatedly ran his hands through your hair.
objection.
miss Butler identified Mr. Calison as her attacker.
she should be allowed to address him as such.
sustained.
very well. You, you stated I ran my hands through your hair.
Yes.
you also said that I whispered in your ear.
what did I say? Objection.
we've been over this.
judge: Overruled.
you keep, you kept saying...
bad... little girls...
deserve to be... punished.
wayne: Did I say why?
I...CAN'T remember.
and then what did I do, Janet?
you...
...took out a knife and s-s-started cutting me.
go on.
I begged you to stop it.
Y- you were touching my, my face.
people request a recess.
granted. We're adjourned until tomorrow morning.
you take care of her, okay?
we need to talk.
Janet's burying you.
ironic, under the circumstances.
I think I'm doing quite well...
given the competition.
the hero worship rap's getting old, Wayne.
you and I both know you killed those women.
so let's just end it right now.
but Janet and I still have so much to talk about.
why don't you just admit you abducted Janet?
you're pretty.
I'll bet you were Daddy's little girl, weren't you? Go to hell.
whoever killed these women,
I bet he'd have a field day with you.
Yeah. Okay, so.
five counts of manslaughter.
I'll drop attempted murder,
permanent commitment to a state mental hospital.
how's your daughter, Sebastian?
take the deal, Wayne. Such a beautiful girl.
but she seems troubled.
let's leave her out of this, shall we?
I'm sure you did the best you could, but I think she still has daddy issues.
I'm warning you, Wayne.
I could help her work through her pain.
I could show her what real pain feels like.
I'd do that for you sometime.
come on, come on.
all right!
physically attacking opposing counsel at a plea conference.
that's a brand new move, Sebastian.
you should do something about your temper.
judge: Your behavior is completely unacceptable, Mr. Stark.
I, I apologize, Your Honor.
does the district attorney wish to weigh in on this?
Mr. Stark's attack on the defendant was outrageous
I have disciplined him and I would be more than happy to remove him from the case.
under the circumstances, a mistrial seems warranted with a new trial to commence immediately.
wayne: Your Honor, I don't want Sebastian removed from the case.
that's not your decision, Mr. Calison.
well, the jury should know,
I got these scratches through no fault of my own.
and I think Mr. Stark should be in the courtroom when I tell them.
it's the least I can do.
Mr. Stark's hands were around my, my throat and I could barely breathe.
I'm just a schoolteacher.
I'm not ashamed to admit I was, I was scared.
Mr. Stark.
sometimes, in the heat of trial, emotions boil over.
I apologize to Mr. Calison, to the jury and to this court.
I do, however, have a few questions.
why do you think I attacked you?
I don't know.
clearly you have anger issues.
that may be true.
but do you recall what you said during our plea conference?
Oh, Your Honor, I believe that, uh...
the specifics of a plea conference are inadmissible.
but Mr. Calison opened the door to these facts by testifying about my attack on him
I should be allowed to put that event into context.
I'll allow it.
Oh, wait. This is not, that's not... You may proceed,
Mr. Stark. This is a recording of the plea conference in question.
and with the court's permission,
I'd like to play it for the jury.
no. Your Honor... You forgot to say "Objection."
well, this is entrapment.
I mean, I- I was unaware I was being recorded.
that's irrelevant, Your Honor.
he's right, Mr. Calison.
well, the law allows me a reasonable expectation of privacy.
actually, not when you're interacting with the District Attorney's office.
it's called the "adversarial system" for a reason.
you learn this stuff in law school.
enough, Mr. Stark. Just play the tape.
wayne: How's your daughter, Sebastian?
stark: Take the deal, Wayne.
such a beautiful girl, but she seems troubled.
let's leave her out of this, shall we?
I'm sure you did the best you could, but I think she still has daddy issues.
I'm warning you, Wayne.
I could help her work through her pain.
I could show her what real pain feels like.
I'd do that for you, Sebastian.
for a guy who abhors violence, you're kinda scary, Wayne.
did you check out the jury when they heard Calison threaten Julie?
Yeah. That on top of Janet Butler's testimony.
we're golden.
Wayne intends to recall Janet to the stand to finish his cross.
let him. After that tape, beating up Janet will make him look like a bigger bastard.
martin would've gotten off on this.
Really?
he loved it when you pulled out the shark moves.
he seemed such a straight arrow.
Yeah, he was.
but he also liked to nail the bad guys.
well, then, this one's for Martin.
we're gonna be late for court.
Janet, it's Raina Troy.
are you here?
wait here.
Janet, it's Isaac Wright.
are you okay?
Oh,
the medical examiners ruled Miss Butler's death a suicide.
my investigator checked her phone records.
before she killed herself,
Janet received a phone call,
from Men's Central Jail.
merely confirming facts with Miss Butler.
harassment, Your Honor.
pure and simple, he verbally abused this poor girl until she took her own life.
and I suppose you have that on tape, too.
: he knows we can't record his conversations from jail as long as he's representing himself.
it's part of this ridiculous scam.
this is a tragedy, but there is no compelling evidence that Mr. Calison caused Miss Butler's death.
well, fine. Let's just get on with it.
wayne: Excuse me.
I never had the chance to finish questioning Miss Butler.
so? So, it is my constitutional right to fully examine the witness. I'm hoping this this a morbid attempt at gallows humor.
which I think means that Miss Butler's testimony must be stricken from the record?
stark: Your Honor, that would be the most appalling...
Mr. Stark. Mr. Calison's cross-examination was suspended at your request.
Janet Butler's entire testimony is hereby excluded.
it was a strong closing.
circumstantial house of cards.
well, you used what you had.
without the victim's testimony...
her name is Janet Butler.
you had to put her on the stand.
she told me she couldn't handle it.
I just wouldn't listen.
the stakes were too high. You had no choice.
I put her in harm's way. I let Calison finish the job.
we needed her testimony.
but we didn't get it, did we?
now she's dead.
the jury's back.
judge: Will the defendant please rise?
has the jury reached a decision?
we have, Your Honor.
in the matter of County of Los Angeles five counts of felony murder we find the defendant not guilty.
judge: The court thanks the jurors for their service.
Mr. Calison, pending Sheriff Department paperwork, you are free to go.
wayne: No hard feelings?
I understand. You're disappointed.
you don't lose... often.
you're sick, Wayne.
you need help.
the Lord helps those who help themselves.
see you around, Sebastian.
you can't blame yourself, Dad.
I had him.
I let him get away.
that poor girl killed herself.
you had no control over that.
: if this guy kills anybody else...
then they'll catch him, and next time you'll put him in jail.
dad?
dad.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm, I'm so sorry.
I- I'm so sorry, I thought you were...
could you put his drinks on my tab, please?

adapted and directed by KEISUKE KINOSHITA "An autumn wind reminds me
of the sad days in my youth.
you hear well for your age.
how old are you?
73 already.
I've become really senile these days.
no wonder. My grandson is a college student.
you must be carefree.
I had a hard time during the war.
but, I can afford to go out now.
I wanted to come to my old home before I die.
people rarely go by boat nowadays.
I thought you were curious.
there was no train in my childhood.
this river reminds me of many things.
the Saitos were a big old family.
since the reform they've fallen and disappeared.
I don't know where they are.
we didn't exchange letters often...
...after my brother had died.
his adopted son took over.
we're relatives only by name.
out of sight, out of mind.
even real brothers can't stay together forever.
life is really a short dream.
in happiness or sadness.
everyone, rich or poor, must go into a grave.
it was in autumn too.
I can never forget.
it was 60 years ago...
so I don't remember the details.
but, I feel it was only yesterday.
please don't laugh...
...at an old man's sentimental remembrance.
you were my only love in life.
I can never forget.
Masao.
Tamiko!
your letter just arrived.
how is your mother? Very sick?
no, not very.
Mrs. Saito is weak.
she was better in spring.
everyone is either poor or weak.
we can't afford to stay in bed.
are you going to help her? Why not marry Masao?
don't fool me!
he's waving.
you should answer him.
who is living in that house now?
nobody. That's too big for any villager.
and too old too.
it'll fall down some time.
children call it a ghost house.
my native house became a ghost house.
life is really transient.
things have mercilessly changed.
I really miss the good old days.
you smeared my paper!
don't interfere!
I want to study with you.
then I'll clean your room.
it's dirty here.
I'm studying!
your fault.
no, yours. Go now.
finish your work quickly.
don't interfere with Masao.
I want to study too.
girls must learn house work.
Dressmaking, for example.
what a shame!
will he leave in November?
Yes, he must enter a highschool.
I'll be lonely.
don't be childish.
send for my medicine.
take tea to the others on the field.
let's go see the firework tonight.
how about you?
no, I can see it from home.
there is a show too.
I must help my aunt.
they're always together!
I like staying home.
me too.
tea at last.
they always loiter on their way!
we brought your tea.
the bath fire's gone out.
you're only worried about Masao.
fidgeting all the time while he is away.
his mother is worried.
don't lie. She's been asleep.
you didn't come to help, only to see Masao.
stop talking and work.
you must be dareful too, Tamiko.
masao is late. Go and see.
don't tease Tamiko. She's my niece.
you're an employee, Omasu.
be nice to me.
come with me to a show.
you two aren't children any more.
people say you're too intimate.
be careful.
don't go into his room, Tamiko.
you're older than him, aren't you?
you're 17. You can't have a bad reputation.
you must be careful too, Masao.
but, we aren't doing anything wrong.
you told me she's as good as my sister.
Yes, I treat her like my daughter.
but, people talk...
they've no ground.
let them talk.
Tamiko, finish that dress tonight.
she always sticks to him.
mother thinks they're children. I warned her.
you misunderstand.
they're innocent.
you're jealous because she's pretty.
why not marry her, then?
you may leave me for her.
a jealous wind snakes the light.
I cannot say it isn't right.
how is Mother?
she seems better today.
don't be so formal.
you never come to my room.
will you clean it?
do it yourself.
Masao, go and pick egg-apples.
I thought you were studying.
why not ask Tamiko to do it?
pick a lot of them.
your mother sent me.
she sympathized with me staying home all day.
did you know I was here?
of course.
it was only a moment's love.
but I have no regret.
what is it?
you're cold these days. You don't like me any more.
Oh, how can you say that?
you seem so.
your mother scolded us. What could I do?
I'm a woman and I'm older than you.
I'm trying hard to obey her, and you blame me.
I didn't really mean it. Don't be angry.
you have changed and don't even talk to me.
I've been lonely.
what can I do?
mother said I should ask you to clean my room.
did she say so?
and she sent you here after me.
how nice she is!
maybe she made a mistake.
I'll take the blame. Never mind the others.
I won't. We've been good friends since childhood.
look, the sun is beautiful!
she'll say something.
never mind. Mother sent us together.
Hello, lovers!
you call me a stupid?
damn premature kid!
Omasu was frank and good to me before.
lately she's very sarcastic. Maybe she hates me.
she's only jealous about us.
jealousy is a woman's vice.
you talk like a grownup man.
sure, I'm no longer a child.
better go. People will talk again.
you said you wouldn't care what people would say.
I don't care either.
good night!
Tamiko.
let's keep away from each other.
it'd be better for you.
I'll be lonely but it can't be helped.
go and sleep now.
I'll go so they wouldn't see me.
good night.
poor star-dust falling
without brightly shining.
eat a lot.
thanks for your help.
we forgot to reap the cotton in the mountain.
we must hurry.
Yes, the festival is beginning.
Masao, will you go with Tamiko?
can you manage without them?
Yes, we can do the rest alone.
then, we'll ask you two.
will you massage me, Tamiko?
make good lunches for them for tomorrow, Omasu.
sending them into the mountains!
mothers don't understand. Why don't you tell her?
that's the proper job for them.
villagers talk about them.
a really shameful rumor.
don't you know?
aren't you the source?
Masao, what are you doing?
I was waiting.
Oh, beautiful! I adore starworts.
you too? I like them very much.
maybe I'm an incarnation of starwort.
I can't love it more.
that's why you're like a starwort.
let's go.
why am I a starwort?
well, you radiate the same feeling.
did you say you liked it?
I do like it.
what are you thinking of?
nothing.
you're thinking of something. Be frank.
to be frank, I'm sad about my age.
I'm older than you.
that makes me sad.
you were born ahead of me. That's all.
you're 17 now, and I'll be 17 in 2 years.
you're odd today.
tired?
we came half way.
let's rest after we get there.
Yes, we'll be alone there.
Hello! Nice day, isn't it?
are you enjoying your honeymoon?
my mother has sent us.
you're making me jealous, Tamiko.
Tsune, leave us alone.
Oh, yes, sorry. Have a good time.
I must leave next month. Only 2 weeks left.
this may be the last chance for us to talk.
we must part.
that's what I've been thinking of.
you laughed at my worries.
cheer up. You needn't cry.
I can come home once in a while.
your sister and Omasu say nasty things to me.
my sister-in-law is cross.
but, Omasu is good at heart.
her parents were killed in the war, when she was a baby.
we should be kind to her.
Yes, I think so too.
I often give her my things.
you're really a kind man.
why are you smiling?
you're like a bellflower.
you radiate the same feeling.
you're sarcastic.
I didn't know it was so beautiful.
I've fallen in love with it.
you're a starwort, and I'm a bellflower?
because you understand how I feel,
I don't insist more from love.
you must be tired. Shall we take a rest?
I didn't think we'd be so late.
no use to worry.
let's hurry the way.
we aren't doing anything wrong.
you're too careless, Mother, ...sending them into the mountains.
I'm worried about them too.
maybe I must be more careful.
but, you shouldn't say that.
leave them.
welcome back.
I'm home.
you're late. Take a bath and eat.
thank them for their trouble at least.
I planned to send you to highschool next month...
...but I changed my mind.
leave in 3 days, immediately after the festival.
I want to stay out of bed during the festival.
but I feel weak.
help yourselves.
I couldn't control my heart,
uneasy like a bush in a wind.
I feel like doing nothing at all.
I don't want to go out or read.
I only think of you, Tamiko.
whenever I'm with you, I'm happy.
I wonder what happened to me.
like a flower without roots,
I don't know what to do in love.
I've been looking for you.
read this later.
I wonder what happened to me.
I must go and study at high school...
...but it's hard to part from you.
you're worried that you're older than I.
but I don't care.
let's promise we'll be each other's some day.
I'll return and see you in the winter vacation.
yours truly, Masao
I'm ready.
goodby, Masao!
we expected another meeting,
this vague, unreliable thing.
I lived in a dormitory...
...but I couldn't forget her a moment.
I scolded myself but it didn't work at all.
I tried to mix in the others, and tire myself to sleep.
so passed the year.
I came home in late December on vacation.
I'm home.
welcome home.
change quickly.
you were away for 2 months.
how are you?
I'm better, if it's not so cold.
and the others?
collecting wood in the mountains.
I'll go and see.
they'll be back soon.
relax.
how's school?
interesting?
busy working.
I'd hoped I'd see Tamiko today, but I couldn't.
nobody told me a word about her.
I guessed she had gone home.
I controlled myself and didn't ask anyone.
what are you doing?
only seeing the fields.
I know what you think.
I'm sorry for you and Tamiko.
your sister-in-law is really cross.
I hate to stay with her any longer.
she sent Tamiko away the day before yesterday.
she made low hints about you and Tamiko.
even to your mother.
I'm so sorry for Tamiko.
I was cross too before.
I heard you sympathized with me, Masao.
thank you.
I did my best to help Tamiko.
she cried everyday since you had left.
stop crying and write to him. Here's a letter pad.
I can't do it.
the others want to separate me from him.
don't mind them. Better write.
masao can't write to you.
he lives in the school dormitory.
my letter would cause him trouble.
you're cousins.
I won't write. He'll return in winter.
but, you'll have no chance to talk with him.
I don't care.
I'm sorry for you.
forgive me for what I did.
what were you doing?
crying again? What's so sad?
mother wants you.
she'll be late. She walks crying all the way.
I should've sent her earlier for medicine.
perhaps she stopped at her house to cry.
she's often absent-minded these days.
she wants to marry Masao.
people believe so.
that's impossible.
masao has to study.
you should tell her.
I told her indirectly.
she won't give up hope so easily.
it's her chance to get fields.
and she knows you love her.
if you don't want her to marry him...
...you'd better send her away now.
I don't mean to oblige you...
...but I've really loved you.
you shared my milk with Masao.
whenever I made clothes for Masao...
I made some for you.
I treated you like my daughter.
it's not my real wish to send you away before Masao returns.
I also want you to listen, Omasu.
I know how you feel, but you'd better go.
you can't stand to be talked ill of, can you?
if you stay until Masao returns...
...you'll only have a harder time.
I'm sorry to say this.
but please do me this favor.
it'll be good for Masao too.
he has to study for many years to come.
I'll leave, auntie. Thanks for everything.
I'll leave too!
don't do that.
if you leave now, people will laugh too.
bear up.
stay at least on New Year's day.
only that day.
drop at her house on your way.
Tsune's funeral.
he drank too much a few days ago.
he was found drowned in the river.
a bad-hearted man never dies beautifully, they say.
man's life is really frail.
are you awake?
feeling better?
the postmaster is downstairs.
he invited us to the theater on the 5th.
I don't want to go.
his real reason is you, Tamiko.
he brought a proposal...
father and Mother are happy.
I hope you'll be happy too.
Kiya's son wants you. His family is very rich.
get well by then.
I really hope Tamiko'll accept it.
I'm sorry to trouble you.
I wanted to visit your family in any case.
I feel better, and the day is fine.
I'm all right now, thanks to Tamiko.
but, she's very stubborn.
we don't know how to persuade her.
we're obliged to the postmaster.
we can't refuse without any reasons.
I'll talk to her somehow.
I'd appreciate it.
look at the cherry blossoms!
shall I go and see?
no, better not.
I hope she won't hold out against her aunt.
listen, Tamiko.
if you think of marrying my son...
I won't let you.
I'll never agree.
even if you refuse Kiya's son or anyone...
...you won't be Masao's wife.
masao hasn't come for a long time.
I like him better than Eizo.
he's honest and good-natured.
I imagine how he's grown.
I remember he climbed up the persimmon tree...
he picked many persimmons...
...and Tamiko was under him collecting them.
4 or 5 years ago.
Yes, it was 4 years ago.
I'm sorry for both Tamiko and Masao.
is she still being difficult?
No!
she agreed.
she's coming down.
has she agreed?
she's a good girl after all.
she listened to me and agreed.
is that so?
thank you very much!
what are you saying? Tamiko has agreed herself.
the postmaster'll be happy.
poor girl!
I'm sorry I troubled you, auntie.
I'm glad you have understood.
have you agreed?
can I tell them?
don't change your mind.
you're lucky to marry Kiya's son.
many girls have wanted to be his wife.
remember that.
thank you again, auntie.
Tamiko, try to forget Masao.
I understand how you feel.
I'm happy.
everything goes well now!
Tamiko is lucky.
I'll go to the postmaster.
I don't understand why you're so happy.
aren't you her mother?
what do you mean?
sympathize with her.
aren't you happy?
you don't understand.
listen, everyone.
in the past 60 years of my life...
do you know what was the happiest thing in my life?
it was when I married my dead husband.
my life was worth living because of that.
the other things weren't important.
are you opposed?
I'm not opposed to this marriage.
I only want you to understand how she feels.
a bride should lower her head.
I was told not to tell you about this.
not even to write to you.
I thought it was too late too.
are you going to Tokyo?
I can't stand your sister-in-law any more.
I'm determined to leave.
I can work as a servant anywhere.
I wish you happiness.
thank you. My brother found me an employer.
he says it's an easy job, but I'm ready for hard work.
all I can do is work faithfully.
take care.
you too. I'm sorry I brought only bad news.
but, I couldn't keep it unsaid.
I'm all right.
Tamiko is Tamiko. Her marriage doesn't matter.
I know she thinks only of you even after marriage.
otherwise, she wouldn't keep living.
I must go now, Omasu.
thank you for coming.
Hello, anybody in?
they're in the fields.
I'll bring them soon.
a telegram for Masao Saito.
come HOME IMMEDIATELY STOP MOTHER
I'm home.
you came quickly.
what happened?
mother's waiting.
mother, what is it?
Masao! Thanks for coming quickly.
the telegram shocked me.
I had to see you. Anyway, eat first.
I thought you got worse.
Yes, a little.
you must be hungry.
Masao, did you know Tamiko got married?
Yes, I did.
Oh, did you know that?
why didn't you warm his soup?
it's OK.
why are you excited?
did Mother tell you anything?
not yet.
give me hot water.
not so hot.
your fault, stupid!
Tamiko is dead.
is it my fault?
what have I done?
ask your own heart!
I'm sorry.
I was cruel to Tamiko.
apologize to her for me.
when did she die?
4 days ago. It's just like I caused her death.
how did she die?
she must have been thinking only of you...
...even after she got married.
her husband didn't like it.
after her 5-month baby miscarried...
...she got divorced and was in bed at home.
why didn't you let me see her before dying?
Tamiko, it's me.
don't be weak.
be strong and try to recover.
thank you for everything, auntie.
what are you saying/
you've been kind to me.
don't say that.
I think I'm dying.
don't be so weak!
you aren't dying. Don't give up.
I don't want to live, auntie.
don't be silly! Tamiko!
Tamiko didn't say a word about you.
so, we thought she had given you up.
we're sorry we didn't even tell you.
when we were fixing her bed after she died...
...we found she held something in her left hand placed on her heart.
we pitied her but we were also curious.
we opened her hand and saw what it was.
it told us everything.
she didn't say a word about you...
...because she couldn't excuse herself to you.
in her hand was a package of red silk...
...which contained your letter and a bellflower.
late autumn and the fields are lonesome.
only crickets sing by her grave.
you WERE LIKE A WILD CHRYSANTHEMUM
the END
why today?
do you want to hear me say it?
18 months since our last appointment.
you read the papers?
sometimes...
and you watch telly?
you know why I'm here.
I'm here because...
what happened, John?
Sherl...
you need to get it out.
my best friend...
Sherlock Holmes...is dead.
falls of the Reichenbach. Turner's masterpiece.
thankfully recovered, owing to the prodigious talent of Mr Sherlock Holmes.
a small token of our gratitude.
diamond cufflinks... All my cuffs have buttons.
he means thank you. - Do I?
just say it. - Thank you.
hang on.
back together with my family, after my terrifying ordeal.
and we have one person to thank for my deliverance...
Sherlock Holmes.
tie pin. I don't wear ties. - Shhh.
Peter Ricoletti...
number One on Interpol's most wanted list since 1982.
we got him, and there's one person we have to thank for giving us the decisive leads with all his customary diplomacy and tact.
sarcasm. - Yes.
we all chipped in.
Oh...
put the hat on. Put the hat on.
Yes, Sherlock, put it on.
just get it over with.
Boffin"!
boffin Sherlock Holmes"!
everybody gets one.
one what? - Tabloid nickname.
SuBo, Nasty Nick.
Jim Moriarty will get one soon.
page Five, Column Six, first sentence.
why is it always the hat photograph?!
bachelor John Watson. - What kind of hat is it?
bachelor... What the hell are they implying?!
is it a cap? Why has it got two fronts? - It's a deerstalker.
frequently seen in the company of bachelor John Watson.
stalker deer with a hat.
what are you going to do? Throw it?
confirmed bachelor John Watson. - A death frisbee!
OK, this is too much, - we need to be more careful. - It's got flaps.
ear flaps. It's an ear hat, John.
what do you mean, more careful?
I mean, this isn't a deerstalker now, it's a Sherlock Holmes hat.
I mean, you're not exactly a private detective any more.
you're this far from famous. - Oh, it'll pass.
it better pass.
the press will turn, Sherlock, they always turn and they'll turn on you.
it really bothers you. - What?
what people say. - Yes.
about me? I don't understand. Why would it upset you?
just try to keep a low profile.
find yourself a little case this week.
stay out of the news.
that's your phone.
hmm, it keeps doing that.
so, did you just talk to him for a really long time?
Oh, Henry Fishguard never committed suicide.
bow Street runners missed everything.
pressing case, is it?
they're all pressing until they're solved.
put your key back please. Thank you.
excuse me, sir.
any metal objects, keys, mobile phones?
you can go through.
thank you.
fancy a cuppa then, mate?
Yeah, why not?
gilts at seven.
dutch Telecoms in free-fall. Thank you, Harvey.
what are you saying?
refuse them all parole and bring back the rope?
let's begin.
this is an emergency. Please leave.
sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
sir, there's been a break-in.
not our division.
you'll want it.
the vault!
hacked into the Tower of bloody London's security?!
how?!
tell them we're on our way!
there's been another one, another break-in.
bank of England!
sir! Security's down, sir. It's failing.
what is it now?
pentonville Prison.
Oh no!
no rush.
I'll get it, shall I?
here. - Not now, I'm busy.
Sherlock... - Not now!
he's back.
that glass is tougher than anything.
not tougher than crystallised carbon.
he used a diamond.
# Oh, sinnerman, where you gonna run to? #
# Sinnerman, where you gonna run to? #
# Where you gonna run to? #
# All on that day, #
# Well, I run to the rock... #
ready? - Yes.
stand back. Stand back. - Mr Holmes. Mr Holmes.
let them through. - Thank you. Get in.
# Oh, Lord... #
# Please help me, Lord, #
# Don't you see me praying. #
# Don't you see me down here praying. #
# But the Lord said, #
# Go to the devil. The Lord said, #
# Go to the devil. #
# He said Go to the devil. #
# All on that day. #
# So I ran to the devil. #
# He was waiting... #
remember... - Yes.
remember... - Yes.
remember what they told you. Don't try to be clever. - No.
please, keep it simple and brief.
God forbid the star witness at the trial should appear intelligent.
intelligent, fine. Let's give "smart-arse" a wide berth.
I'll just be myself. - Are you listening to me?
today, standing outside the Old Bailey...
this is the trial of the century...
the trial of James Moriarty...
James Moriarty, earlier today accused of...
attempting to steal the Crown Jewels.
at the Old Bailey we have,
Reichenbach hero Sherlock Holmes...
would you mind slipping your hand into my pocket?
Thanks.
# It was boiling, I ran to the sea, #
# It was boiling I ran to the sea... #
crown v Moriarty, please proceed to Court 10.
you're him.
wrong toilet.
I'm a big fan. - Evidently.
I read your cases, follow them all.
sign my shirt, would you?
there are two types of fans. - Oh?
catch me before I kill again, Type A. - Uh-huh.
what's Type B? - Your bedroom's just a taxi ride away.
hmm. Guess which one I am?
neither.
Really? - No, you're not a fan at all.
those marks on your forearm, edge of a desk.
you've been typing in a hurry, probably, pressure on, facing a deadline.
that all?
there's an ink smudge on your wrist, a bulge in your jacket pocket.
bit of a giveaway? - The smudge is deliberate, to see if I'm as good as they say I am.
hmm. Oil-based, used in newspaper print.
but drawn on with an index finger, your finger. - Hmm.
journalist. Unlikely you get your hands dirty at the press.
you put that there to test me. - Wow! I'm liking you.
I'd make a great feature, "Sherlock Holmes, the man beneath the hat."
Kitty... Riley. Pleased to meet you.
no, I'm just saving you the job of asking.
no, I won't give you an interview.
no, I don't want the money.
you and John Watson, just platonic?
can I put you down for a "no" there as well?
there's all sorts of gossip in the press about you.
sooner or later, you're going to need someone on your side.
someone to set the record straight.
you think you're the girl for that job, do you?
I'm smart and you can trust me...
totally.
smart? OK, investigative journalist.
good. Well, look at me and tell me what you see.
if you're that skilful, you don't need an interview, you can just read what you need.
no? OK, my turn.
I look at you and I see someone who's still waiting for their first big scoop, so their editor will notice them.
you're wearing an expensive skirt, that's been rehemmed twice.
the only posh skirt you've got.
your nails, you can't afford to do them that often.
I see someone who's hungry.
I don't see smart. I don't see trustworthy.
I'll give you a quote, if you like. Three little words.
you repel me.
a consulting criminal. - Yes.
your words. Can you expand on that answer?
James Moriarty is for hire. - A tradesman?
Yes. - But not the sort who'd fix your heating?
no, the sort who'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination.
but I'm sure he'd make a decent job of your boiler.
would you describe him as...
leading. - What?
can't do that. You're leading the witness.
he'll object and the judge'll uphold. - Mr Holmes.
ask me how. How would I describe him?
what opinion have I formed of him? Do they not teach you this?
mr Holmes, we are fine without your help.
how would you describe this man, his character?
first mistake.
James Moriarty isn't a man at all.
he's a spider.
a spider at the centre of a web, a criminal web with a thousand threads and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances.
and how long...? - No, no. Don't, don't do that.
that's really not a good question. - Mr Holmes!
how long have I known him? Not your best line of enquiry.
we met twice, five minutes in total.
I pulled a gun, he tried to blow me up.
I felt we had a special something.
miss Sorrel, are you seriously claiming this man is an expert?
after knowing the accused for just five minutes?
two minutes would have made me an expert, five was ample.
mr Holmes, that's a matter for the jury. - Oh, really?
one librarian, two teachers, two high-pressure jobs, probably the City.
the foreman's a medical secretary, trained - abroad, judging by her shorthand. - Mr Holmes?
seven are married, two are having an affair with each other.
Oh, they've just had tea and biscuits.
would you like to know who ate the wafer? - Mr Holmes!
you've been called here to answer Miss Sorrel's questions, not to give us a display of your intellectual prowess.
keep your answers brief and to the point.
anything else will be treated as contempt.
do you think you could survive for just a few minutes...
without showing off?!
what did I say? I said don't get clever.
I can't just turn it on and off like a tap. Well? - Well, what?
you were there for the whole thing, up in the gallery, start to finish.
like you said he would be - sat on his backside, never even stirred.
Moriarty is not mounting any defence.
bank of England, Tower of London, Pentonville.
three of the most secure places in the country and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in, no one knows how or why.
all we know is... He ended up in custody.
don't do that. - Do what?
the look. - Look?
you're doing the look again.
well, I can't see it, can I?
it's my face.
yes and you're doing a thing, you are doing "We both know what's really going on here" face.
we do. - No, I don't, which is why I find the face so annoying.
if Moriarty wanted the jewels, he'd have them.
if he wanted the prisoners freed, they'd be on the streets.
the reason he's still in a prison cell is because he chose to be there.
somehow this is part of his scheme.
mr Crayhill, can we have your first witness?
your Honour, we're not calling any witnesses.
I don't follow.
you've entered a plea of not guilty.
nevertheless, my client is offering no evidence.
the defence... rests.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, James Moriarty stands accused...
of several counts of attempted burglary.
crimes which, if he's found guilty, will elicit a very long custodial sentence, and yet... his legal team...
has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever to support their plea.
I find myself in the unusual position of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly.
you must find him guilty.
guilty.
you must find him guilty.
they're coming back. - That's six minutes.
surprised it took them that long, to be honest.
there's a queue for the loo!
have you reached a verdict on which you all agree?
not guilty, they found him not guilty.
no defence，but Moriarty's walked free.
Sherlock?
are you listening? He's out, you know he'll be coming after you. Sherl...
most people knock.
but then, you're not most people, I suppose.
kettle's just boiled.
johann Sebastian would be appalled.
may I? - Please.
you know when he was on his deathbed, Bach, he heard his son at the piano playing one of his... pieces.
the boy stopped before he got to the end.
the dying man jumped out of bed, ran to the piano and finished it.
couldn't cope with an unfinished melody. - Neither can you, that's why you've come.
be honest, you're a tiny bit pleased. - What, with the verdict?
with me, back on the streets.
every fairy tale needs a good old-fashioned villain.
you need me or you're nothing.
because we're just alike, you and I, except you're boring.
you're on the side of the angels.
you got to the jury, of course.
I got into the Tower of London, you think I can't worm my way into 12 hotel rooms?
cable network.
every hotel bedroom has a personalised TV screen.
and every person has their pressure point.
someone that they want to protect from harm.
easy peasy.
so how are you going to do it?
burn me?
Ah, that's the problem, the final problem.
have you worked out what it is yet?
what's the final problem?
I did tell you... but did you listen?
how hard do you find it, having to say "I don't know"?
I don't know. - Oh, that's clever, very clever, awfully clever.
speaking of clever, have you told your little friends yet?
told them what?
why I broke into all those places and never took anything? - No.
but you understand? - Obviously.
off you go, then.
tell you what you already know? - No, prove that you know it.
you didn't take anything because you don't need to. - Good.
you'll never need to take anything ever again. - Very good, because?
because nothing in the Bank of England, the Tower of London or Pentonville Prison could possibly match the value of the key that could get you into all three.
I can open any door anywhere with a few tiny lines of computer code.
no such thing as a private bank account now, they're all mine.
no such thing as secrecy, I own secrecy.
nuclear codes?
I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order.
in a world of locked rooms, the man with the key is king.
and honey, you should see me in a crown.
you were advertising all through the trial, you were showing the world what you can do.
and you were helping.
big client list - rogue governments, intelligence communities, terrorist cells.
they all want me.
suddenly, I'm Mr Sex.
if you can break any bank, what do you care about the highest bidder?
I don't, I just like to watch them all competing.
daddy loves me the best." Aren't ordinary people adorable?
well, you know, you've got John. I should get myself a live-in one.
why are you doing all of this? - It must be so funny.
you don't want money or power, not really.
what is it all for?
I want to solve the problem.
our problem.
the final problem.
it's going to start very soon, Sherlock... the fall.
but don't be scared, falling is just like flying, except there's a more permanent destination.
never liked riddles.
learn to.
because I owe you a fall, Sherlock.
I... owe... you.
er, excuse me, I'm looking for Mycroft Holmes?
would you happen to know if he's around at all?
can you not hear me?
Yes, all right. Anyone?
anyone at all know...
where Mycroft Holmes is, I've been asked to meet him here?
no takers, right. Am I invisible, can you actually see me?
Ah, thanks, gents. I've been asked to meet Mycroft Holmes. What the hell?!
tradition, John, our traditions define us.
so total silence is traditional, is it?
you can't even say pass the sugar?
three-quarters of the diplomatic service and half the government front bench all sharing one tea trolley, it's for the best, believe me.
we don't want a repeat of... 1972.
but we can talk in here. - You read this stuff?
caught my eye. - Mm-hm.
saturday, they're doing a big expose.
I'd love to know where she got her information.
someone called Brook. Recognise the name?
school friend, maybe?
of Sherlock's?
but that's not why I asked you here.
who's that? - Don't know?
no. - Never seen his face before?
um... - He's taken a flat in Baker Street, two doors down from you.
hm, I was thinking of doing a drinks thing for the neighbours.
I'm not sure you'll want to.
Sulejmani, Albanian hit squad, expertly trained killer, living less than 20 feet from your front door.
well, it's a great location. Jubilee line's handy.
John... - What's it got to do with me?
Dyachenko. Ludmila.
Oh...
actually, I think I have seen her. - Russian killer.
she's taken the flat opposite.
OK.
I'm sensing a pattern here.
in fact, four top international assassins relocate to within spitting distance of 221b.
anything you'd care to share with me?
I'm moving? - It's not hard to guess the common denominator, is it?
you think this is Moriarty?
he promised Sherlock he'd come back.
if this was Moriarty, we'd be dead already. - If not Moriarty, then who?
why don't you talk to Sherlock, if you're so concerned about him?
Oh, God, don't tell me.
too much history between us, John.
old scores, resentments.
nicked all his Smurfs? Broke his Action Man?
finished.
we both know what's coming, John.
Moriarty is obsessed, he's sworn to destroy his only rival.
so you want me to watch out for your brother because he won't accept your help?
if it's not too much trouble?
excuse me. - Sorry.
Sherlock, something weird... What's going on? - Kidnapping.
Rufus Bruhl. The ambassador to the US. - He's in Washington, isn't he?
not him, his children. Max and Claudette, age seven and nine.
they're at St Aldates. - Posh boarding place in Surrey.
school broke up, the boarders went home.
a few kids remained, including those two.
the kids have vanished.
the ambassador's asked for you personally. - The Reichenbach hero.
isn't it great to be working with a celebrity?
we shouldn't need to keep you for much longer. Thank you.
it's all right. - Miss Mackenzie, House Mistress. Go easy.
miss Mackenzie, you're in charge of pupil welfare, yet you left this place wide open last night.
what are you, an idiot, a drunk or a criminal?! Quickly, tell me!
all the doors and windows were properly bolted.
no one, not even me, went into their room last night.
you have to believe me! - I do, I just wanted you to speak quickly.
miss Mackenzie will need to breath into a bag now.
six grand a term, you'd expect them to keep the kids safe for you.
you said the other kids had all left on their holidays.
they were the only two sleeping on this floor.
there's absolutely no sign of a break-in.
the intruder must have been hidden inside some place.
show me where the brother slept.
the boy sleeps there every night.
gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor.
he'd recognise every shape, every outline, the silhouette of everyone who came to the door.
OK, so? - So if someone approaches the door who he doesn't recognise, an intruder, maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon.
what would he do?
in the precious few seconds before they came into the room, how would he use them if not to cry out?
this little boy, this particular little boy, who reads all of those spy books, what would he do?
he'd leave a sign?
get Anderson!
linseed oil.
not much use, it doesn't lead us to the kidnapper. - Brilliant, Anderson.
Really? - Yes, brilliant impression of an idiot.
floor.
he... made a trail for us. The boy was made to walk ahead of them.
on what, tiptoe? - Indicates anxiety.
gun held to his head.
the girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways.
he had his left arm cradled about her neck.
that's the end of it, we don't know where they went from here.
tells us nothing after all.
you're right, Anderson, nothing.
except his shoe size, his height, his gait, his walking pace.
having fun? - Starting to.
maybe don't do the smiling. Kidnapped children?
how could he get past the CCTV? If all the doors were locked.
he walked in when they weren't locked.
but a stranger can't just walk into a school like that.
anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment.
yesterday, end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff.
what's one more stranger among that lot?
he was waiting for them.
all he had to do was find a place to hide.
Molly!
Hello, I'm just going out. I've got a lunch date. - No, you're not.
cancel it, have lunch with me. I need your help. - What?
need your help. One of your old boyfriends, we're tracking him down.
he's been naughty. Of course it's Moriarty! - Moriarty?
Jim wasn't my boyfriend, we went out three times. I ended it.
then he stole the Crown Jewels, broke into the Bank of England and organised a prison break.
for the sake of law and order, I suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship, Molly.
oil, John. The oil in the kidnapper's footprint.
it'll lead us to Moriarty.
all the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved.
the sole of the shoe is like a passport.
if we're lucky, we'll see everything he's been up to.
I need that analysis.
alkaline.
thank you, John. Yes. - Molly
I...owe...you.
glycerol molecule.
what are you?
what did you mean, IOU?
you said IOU.
you were muttering it while you were working. - Nothing, mental note.
you're a bit like my dad. He's dead. No, sorry.
Molly, please don't feel the need to make conversation, it's really not your area.
when he was dying, he was always cheerful, he was lovely, except when he thought no-one could see.
I saw him once, he looked sad. - Molly.
you look sad, when you think he can't see you.
are you OK? And don't just say you are, because I know what that means, looking sad when you think no one can see you.
you can see me. - I don't count.
what I'm trying to say is, that if there's anything I can do, anything you need, anything at all, you can have me.
no, I just mean, I mean, if there's anything you need, it's fine.
but what can I need from you?
nothing. I don't know.
you could probably say thank you, actually.
thank you?
I'm just going to go and get some crisps. Do you want anything?
it's OK, I know you don't.
well, actually, maybe I'll... - I know you don't.
Sherlock? - Hmm?
this envelope that was in her trunk, there's another one. - What?
on our doorstep. Found it today. And look at that. Yes.
look at that, exactly the same seal.
breadcrumbs. - Uh-huh. It was there when I got back.
a little trace of breadcrumbs.
hardback copy of Fairy Tales.
two children led into the forest by a wicked father, follow a little trail of breadcrumbs.
that's Hansel and Gretel. What sort of kidnapper leaves clues?
the sort that likes to boast, that thinks it's a game.
he sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me...
all fairy tales need a good old-fashioned villain.
the fifth substance, it's part of the tale. The witch's house. - What?
the glycerol molecule.
PGPR! - What's that?
it's used in making chocolate.
this fax arrived an hour ago.
what have you got for us?
we need to find a place in the city where all five of these things intersect.
chalk, asphalt, brick dust, vegetation.
what is this, chocolate?! - I think we're looking for a disused sweet factory.
we need to narrow that down. A sweet factory with asphalt?
no, too general. Something more specific.
chalk, chalky clay. That's a far thinner band of geology.
brick dust?
building site. Bricks from the 1950s.
there's thousands of building sites in London.
I've got people out looking. - So have I!
homeless network, faster than the police, far more relaxed about taking bribes.
John.
rhododendron ponticum. Matches.
Addlestone. - What?
a mile of disused factories between the river and the park, matches everything.
right, come on. Come on!
OK, you look over there.
look everywhere.
OK, spread out, please, spread out.
quietly, quietly!
this was alight moments ago. They're still here! Sweet wrappers?
what's he been feeding you? Hansel and Gretel.
Ugh!
mercury. - What?
the papers, they're painted with mercury, lethal.
the more they ate...
it was killing them. - But it's not enough to kill them on its own.
taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them.
he didn't need to be there for the execution.
murder by remote control, he could be 1, 000 miles away.
the hungrier they got, the more they ate, the faster they died. Neat.
Sherlock. - Over here!
I've got him, don't worry.
right then, the professionals are finished.
if the amateurs want to go in and have their turn.
now remember, she's in shock and she's just seven years old, so, anything you can do to...
not be myself? - Yeah, might be helpful.
Claudette, I...
no, no, I know it's been hard for you.
Claudette, listen to me. - Out. Get out!
makes no sense. - Kid's traumatised.
something about Sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper. - What's she said?
hasn't uttered another syllable. - And the boy?
no, he's unconscious. He's still in intensive care.
don't let it get to you,
I always feel like screaming when you walk into a room.
in fact, so do most people.
in fact, so do most people.
come on.
brilliant work you did finding those kids from just a footprint, it's really amazing.
thank you.
unbelievable.
Ah.
you OK? - Thinking.
this is my cab, you get the next one. - Why?
you might talk.
is this chocolate? We're looking for a disused sweet factory.
get out!
Aaaargh!
problem?
... this stunning evening wear set from us at London Taxi Shopping.
can you turn this off, please? The set comprises of a beautiful...
can you turn this off?!
accompanied by four spangly diamond bracelets...
hello.
are you ready for the story?
this is the story of Sir Boast-a-lot.
a footprint, it's all he had.
a footprint.
Yeah, well, you know what he's like. CSI Baker Street.
well, our boys couldn't have done it.
well, that's why we need him, he's better. - That's one explanation.
and what's the other?
sir Boast-a-lot was the bravest and cleverest knight at the round table.
but soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories about how brave he was and how many dragons he'd slain.
and soon they began to wonder, "Are Sir Boast-a-lot's stories even true?"
only he could have found that evidence.
Oh, no.
the girl screams her head off when she sees him - a man she has never seen before, - unless she had seen him before. - What's your point?
you know what it is, you just don't want to think about it.
so, all of the knights went to King Arthur and said, "I don't believe Sir Boast-a-lot's stories."
he's just a big old liar who makes things up to make himself look good.
you're not seriously suggesting he's involved, are you?
we have to entertain the possibility.
and then, even the King began to wonder.
but that wasn't the end of Sir Boast-a-lot's problem.
no.
that wasn't the final problem.
the end.
stop the cab.
stop the cab!
what was that?!
what was that?
no charge.
watch out!
thank you.
Sherlock!
that is him. It's him.
Sulejmani or something, Mycroft showed me his file.
he's a big Albanian gangster, lives two doors down from us.
he died because I shook his hand. - What?
he saved my life, but he couldn't touch me. Why?
four assassins living right on our doorstep.
they haven't come here to kill me.
they have to keep me alive.
I've got something that all of them want.
but if one of them approaches me...
the others kill them before they can get it.
all of the attention is focused on me.
there's a surveillance web closing in on us right now.
so what have you got that's so important?
I need to ask about the dusting.
precise details, in the last week, what's been cleaned?
tuesday, I did your lino. - No, this room, this is where we'll find it.
any break in the dust line.
you can put back anything but dust. Dust is eloquent.
what's he on about?
cameras, we're being watched.
What?! Cameras? Here?
I'm in my nightie!
no, Inspector. - Why?
the answer's no. - You've not heard the question!
you want to take me to the station. Saving you the trouble of asking.
Sherlock.
the scream? - Yeah.
who was it? Donovan? I bet it was Donovan.
am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping?
ha ha, Moriarty is smart.
he planted that doubt in her head. That little nagging sensation.
you're going to have to be strong to resist.
you can't kill an idea, can you?
not once it's made a home... there.
will you come? - One photograph, that's his next move.
Moriarty's game.
first the scream, then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning.
he wants to destroy me inch by inch.
it is a game, Lestrade, and not one I'm willing to play.
give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.
they'll be deciding. - Deciding?
whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me. - You think?
standard procedure. - You should have gone with him. People'll think...
I don't care what people think.
you'd care if they thought you were stupid or wrong.
no, that would just make them stupid or wrong.
Sherlock, I don't want the world believing you're...
that I am what?
a fraud.
you're worried they're right. - What?
that they're right about me. - No.
that's why you're upset.
you can't entertain the possibility they may be right.
you're afraid you've been taken in. - I'm not.
Moriarty is playing with your mind, too. Can't you see what's going on?!
no, I know you for real. - 100 percent?
well, nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time.
Sherlock Holmes? - Yes, sir.
that bloke that's been in the press?
Mm-hm.
I thought he was some sort of private eye.
he is. - We've been consulting with him, that's what you're telling me?
not used him on any proper cases though, have we?
well, one or two.
or 20 or 30.
What?!
I'm not the only senior officer who did this. Gregson... - Shut up!
an amateur detective given access to all sorts of classified information.
and now he's a suspect in a case.
with all due respect... You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade!
now go and fetch him in, right now.
do it!
proud of yourselves? - Well, what if it's not just this case?
what if he's done this to us every single time?
so, still got some friends on the force. It's Lestrade.
says they're all coming over here now.
queuing up to slap on the handcuffs.
every officer you've ever made feel like a tit, which is a lot of people.
yoo-hoo.
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting?
some chap delivered a parcel, I forgot, marked perishable.
I had to sign for it.
funny name, German, like the fairy tales.
burnt to a crisp.
what does it mean?
Police!' I'll go.
Sherlock.
excuse me, Mrs Hudson. We need to talk to you.
you can't just barge in like that!'
have you got a warrant? Have you?'
leave it, John.
eh? Manners!'
Sherlock Holmes, I'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping.
it's OK, John. - He's not resisting.
no, it's not all right, this is ridiculous.
get him downstairs now.
you don't have to do this.
don't try to interfere or I shall arrest you too.
you done?
I said it. - Hmm?
first time we met. - Don't bother.
solving crimes won't be enough. One day he'll cross the line.
now ask yourself, what sort of man would kidnap those kids just so he can impress us all by finding them?
Donovan? - Sir?
got our man? - Er, yes, sir.
looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me.
often are, these vigilante types.
what are you looking at?
are you all right, sir?
joining me? - Yeah.
well, apparently it's against the law to chin the Chief Superintendent.
hmm. Bit awkward this.
there's no-one to bail us.
I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape.
all units to 27.' - What?
all units to 2... '
Aah!
ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees?
now would be good! - Do as he says!
just so you're aware, the gun is his idea, I'm just a... you know.
my hostage. - Hostage, yes, that works. That works.
so what now?
doing what Moriarty wants, becoming a fugitive. Run!
get after him, Lestrade!
take my hand.
now people will definitely talk. The gun! Leave it!
Sherlock, wait!
we're going to need to coordinate.
go to your right. - Huh? - Go to your right.
everybody wants to believe it, that's what makes it so clever.
a lie that's preferable to the truth.
my deductions were a sham.
no-one feels inadequate, Sherlock's an ordinary man.
Mycroft, he could help us.
big family reconciliation, now's not really the moment.
Sherlock... we're being followed. I knew we couldn't outrun the police.
that's not the police, it's one of my new neighbours from Baker Street.
let's see if he can give us some answers.
where are we going?
we're going to jump in front of that bus.
Oh...
tell me what you want from me.
tell me!
he left it at your flat.
who? - Moriarty.
what?
the computer key code. - Of course.
he's selling it. The programme he used to break into the Tower.
he planted it when he came around.
it's a game-changer.
it's a key, it can break into any system and it's sitting in our flat right now.
that's why he left that message, telling everyone where to come "Get Sherlock!"
we need to get back into the flat and search. - CID will be camped out.
why plant it on you?
it's another subtle way of smearing my name, now I'm best pals with all those criminals.
Yeah, well, have you seen this?
a kiss-and-tell.
some bloke called Rich Brook.
who is he?
too late to go on the record?
congratulations, "The Truth About Sherlock Holmes."
the scoop that everybody wanted and you got it. Bravo!
I gave you your opportunity.
I wanted to be on your side, remember?
you turned me down, so...
then look and behold, someone spills all the beans.
how utterly convenient. Who is Brook?
Oh, come on, Kitty, no-one trusts the voice at the end of a phone.
all those little meetings in cafes, those sessions in the hotel room when he gabbled into your Dictaphone.
how do you know that you can trust him?
a man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets.
what were his credentials?
darling, they didn't have any ground coffee, so I just got normal.
you said that they wouldn't find me here, you said that I'd be safe here.
you are safe.
Richard, I'm a witness, they wouldn't harm you in front of witnesses.
so that's your source? Moriarty is Richard Brook?
of course he's Richard Brook, there is no Moriarty.
there never has been. - What are you talking about? - Look him up.
rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes hired to be Moriarty.
Dr. Watson, I know you're a good man, don't, don't, don't hurt me.
no, you are Moriarty! He's Moriarty!
we've met, remember? You were going to blow me up!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
he paid me, I needed the work. I'm an actor, I was out of work.
Sherlock, you'd better explain, because I am not getting this.
I'll be doing the explaining, in print.
it's all here, conclusive proof.
you invented James Moriarty, your nemesis.
invented him?! - Mm-hm.
he invented all the crimes, actually.
and to cap it all, he made up a master villain.
don't be ridiculous! - Ask him. He's right here. Just ask him.
tell him, Richard. - For God's sake, this man was on trial!
Yes, and you paid him to take the rap. Promised you'd rig the jury.
not exactly a West End role, but I'll bet the money was good.
but not so good he didn't want to sell his story.
I am sorry. I am. I am sorry.
so this is the story you're going to publish?
the big conclusion of it all, Moriarty's an actor? - He knows I am.
I have proof. Show them... Kitty, show them something.
Yeah, show me something.
I'm on TV. I'm on kids' TV. I'm the story-teller.
I'm the story-teller. It's on DVD.
just tell him. It's all coming out. It's all over.
just tell them. Just tell them... Tell them! It's all over now!
No! Don't you touch me! Don't you lay a finger on me!
stop it now!
don't hurt me! - Don't let him get away!
leave him alone!
no, no, no. He'll have back-up.
do you know what, Sherlock Holmes?
I look at you know and I can read you... and you repel me.
can he do that?
completely change his identity, make you the criminal?
he's got my whole life story.
that's what you do when you sell a big lie, you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable.
it'll be your word against his.
he's been sowing doubt into people's minds for 24 hours.
there's only one thing he needs to do to complete his game and that...
Sherlock?
there's something I need to do. - What? Can I help? - No, on my own.
you're wrong, you know?
you do count.
you've always counted and I've always trusted you.
but you were right.
I'm not OK.
tell me what's wrong.
Molly, I think I'm going to die.
what do you need? - If I wasn't everything that you think I am, everything that I think I am...
would you still want to help me?
what do you need?
you.
she has really done her homework, Miss Riley, and it's things that only someone close to Sherlock could know.
have you seen your brother's address book lately?
two names, yours and mine...
and Moriarty didn't get this stuff from me.
John... - So how does it work, your relationship?
do you go out for a coffee now and then, you and Jim?
your own brother and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac.
I never intend... I never dreamt...
this... this is what you were trying to tell me, isn't it?
watch his back because I've made a mistake.
how did you meet him?
people like him, we know about them, we watch them.
but James Moriarty...
the most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen, and, in his pocket, the ultimate weapon.
the key code.
a few lines of computer code that can unlock any door.
and you abducted him to try and find the key code?
interrogated him for weeks.
And? - He wouldn't play along.
he just sat there staring into the darkness.
the only thing that made him open up...
I could get him to talk, just a little.
but...
in return you had to offer him Sherlock's life story.
so, one big lie...
Sherlock's a fraud, and people will swallow it because the rest of it's true.
Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed, right, and you have given him the perfect ammunition.
John.
I'm sorry.
Oh, please!
tell him, would you?
I got your message.
the computer code is the key to this.
we find it, we can use it to beat Moriarty exactly.
what do you mean, use it? - He used it to create a false identity so we can break into the records and destroy Richard Brook.
bring back Jim Moriarty again.
somewhere in 221b, somewhere on the day of the verdict he left it hidden.
Uh-huh.
what did he touch? - An apple, nothing else.
did he write anything down? - No.
Oh.
Yeah, speaking.
what?
what happened? Is she OK?
Oh, my God! Right, yes, I'm coming.
what is it? - Paramedics. Mrs Hudson's been shot.
how? - Probably one of the killers you managed to attract. Jesus!
she's dying, Sherlock. Let's go. - You go. I'm busy.
busy?! - Thinking. I need to think.
you need to...? Doesn't she mean anything to you?
you once half-killed a man because he laid a finger on her.
she's my landlady. - She's dying... you machine!
SOD this. Sod this! You stay here if you want, on your own.
alone is what I have. Alone protects me.
no, friends protect people.
# I've been kicked around since I was born. #
# But now it's all right, it's OK, #
# You can look the other way. #
# We can try to understand, #
# The New York Times' effect on man. #
# Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother, #
# You're stayin' alive... #
well... here we are at last.
you and me, Sherlock.
and our problem... the final problem.
staying alive!
it's so boring, isn't it?
it's just staying.
all my life I've been searching for distractions and you were the best distraction and now I don't even have you because I've beaten you.
and you know what? In the end, it was easy.
it was easy.
now I've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people, and it turns out you're ordinary, just like all of them.
Ah, well.
did you almost start to wonder if I was real?
did I nearly get you?
richard Brook.
nobody seems to get the joke, but you do.
of course. - Attaboy.
richard Brook in German is Reichenbach.
the case that made my name. - Just trying to have some fun.
good. You got that too.
beats like digits.
every beat is a one, every rest is a zero.
binary code.
that's why all those assassins tried to save my life.
it was hidden on me, hidden inside my head.
a few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system.
told all my clients, last one to Sherlock is a sissy.
but now that it's up here, I can use it to alter all the records.
I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty.
no, no, no, no, no. This is too easy.
this is too easy.
there is no key, doofus!
those digits are meaningless. They're utterly meaningless.
you don't really think a couple of lines of computer code are going to crash the world around our ears?
I'm disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock.
but the rhythm... - Partita no 1! Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.
but then how did you...? - How did I break into the bank, to the Tower, to the prison?
daylight robbery! All it takes is some willing participants.
I knew you'd fall for it. That's your weakness.
you always want everything to be clever.
shall we finish the game? One final act.
glad you chose a tall building. Nice way to do it.
do it? Do what?
Yes, of course.
my suicide.
genius detective proved to be a fraud.
I read it in the paper so it must be true.
I love newspapers.
fairy tales.
and pretty grim ones too.
Oh, God, John, you made me jump. Is everything OK with the police?
has Sherlock sorted it all out?
Oh, my God.
Taxi!
Taxi! No, no, no. Police... sort of!
Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot!
I can prove that you created an entirely false identity.
Oh, just kill yourself. It's a lot less effort.
go on.
for me.
please!
you're insane.
you're just getting that now? Wo-wo-wo!
OK.
let me give you a little extra incentive.
your friends will die if you don't.
John?
not just John. Everyone.
Mrs Hudson? - Everyone.
Lestrade? - Three bullets, three gunmen, three victims.
there's no stopping them now...
unless my people see you jump.
you can have me arrested, you can torture me, you can do anything you like with me, but nothing's going to prevent them from pulling the trigger.
your only three friends in the world will die unless...
unless I kill myself and complete your story.
you've got to admit, that's sexier.
and I die in disgrace. - Of course. That's the point of this.
Oh. You've got an audience now.
off you pop.
go on.
I told you how this ends.
your death is the only thing that's going to call off the killers.
I'm certainly not going to do it.
would you give me one moment, please?
one moment of privacy.
please.
of course.
What?!
what is it?
what did I miss?
you're not going to do it.
so the killers can be called off, then there's a recall code or a word or a number.
I don't have to die if I've got you.
Oh!
you think you can make me stop the order?
you think you can make me do that?
so do you. - Sherlock, your big brother and all the King's horses couldn't make me do a thing I didn't want to.
Yes, but I'm not my brother, remember?
I am you.
prepared to do anything.
prepared to burn.
prepared to do what ordinary people won't do.
you want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you.
Nah.
you talk big.
Nah.
you're ordinary.
you're ordinary. You're on the side of the angels.
Oh, I may be on the side of the angels, but don't think for one second that I am one of them.
no...
you're not.
I see.
you're not ordinary.
no.
you're me.
you're me.
thank you...
Sherlock Holmes.
thank you.
bless you.
as long as I'm alive, you can save your friends, you've got a way out.
well, good luck with that. - No!
no.
Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye.
Hello?
John. - Hey, Sherlock. Are you OK?
turn around and walk back the way you came. - I'm coming in.
just do as I ask!
please.
where?
stop there.
Sherlock? - OK, look up. I'm on the rooftop.
Oh, God.
I... I can't come down, so we'll just have to do it like this.
what's going on?
an apology.
it's all true.
what?
everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty.
why are you saying this?
I'm a fake.
Sherlock... - The newspapers were right all along.
I want you to tell Lestrade,
I want you to tell Mrs Hudson and Molly.
in fact, tell anyone who will listen to you...
that I created Moriarty for my own purposes.
OK, shut up Sherlock. Shut up.
the first time we met... the first time we met, - you knew all about my sister, right? - Nobody could be that clever.
you could.
I researched you.
before we met, I discovered everything that I could to impress you.
it's a trick. Just a magic trick.
no. All right, stop it now.
no. Stay exactly where you are.
don't move. - All right.
keep your eyes fixed on me.
please, will you do this for me? - Do what?
this phone call, it's...
it's my note.
it's what people do, don't they?
leave a note?
leave a note when?
goodbye, John. - No. Don't...
Sherlock!
Sherlock.
Sherlock... Sherlock.
I'm a doctor, let me come through. Let me come through, please.
he's my friend. He's my friend... Please.
please, let me just...
Oh, Jesus!
no.
God, no.
there's stuff that you wanted to say...
but didn't say it. - Yeah.
say it now.
sorry, I can't.
there's all the stuff. All the science equipment.
I left it all in boxes. I don't know what needs doing.
I thought I'd take it to a school.
would you...? - I can't go back to the flat again, not at the moment.
I'm angry.
it's OK, John. There's nothing unusual in that.
that's the way he made everyone feel.
all the marks on my table and the noise, - firing guns at half past one in the morning... - Yeah.
bloody specimens in my fridge.
imagine, keeping bodies where there's food. - Yes.
and the fighting! Drove me up the wall with all his carryings-on.
listen, I'm not actually that angry, OK?
OK. I'll leave you alone to, you know...
you... you told me once that you weren't a hero.
erm, there were times I didn't even think you were human, but let me tell you this, you were...
the best man...
the most human... human being that I've ever known and no-one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, so...
there.
I was so alone...
and I owe you so much.
but, please, there's just one more thing, one more thing, one more miracle, Sherlock, for me, don't be...
dead.
would you do that just for me?
just stop it. Stop this.
the Case Book Of Sherlock Holmes
look, father, we have been through all this before.
do as I tell you, boy, you damn, disobedient little bastard.
give me the gun.
it's my life and I'm going to run it the way I like.
get up out of it.
the Boscombe Valley Mystery
good morning!
morning!
caught anything?
Ha-ha!
not yet.
Holmes, what on earth are you doing here?
looking for you.
well, carry on my dear fellow, don't let me disturb you.
what on earth are you doing here?
a case has brought me this way.
what sort of case?
the newspapers are calling it the Boscombe Valley mystery,
I expect you've read something of it?
not a word.
I haven't seen a paper for days.
a farmer, Cole McCarthy, Australian by birth met his death by a mirror at the bottom of his farm.
they seem to have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.
there's a big one just under that rock.
so then it's a murder?
well, it's projected to be so.
of course I shall take nothing for granted until I've had a chance to look into it personally.
naturally.
I don't wish to spoil your holiday but I was wondering if I could persuade you to join me for a couple of days?
well of course.
are you sure?
I shall be delighted.
then we must move quickly, our local train leaves in 35 minutes.
your water, sir.
Watson, all of this fresh air will kill me.
Mmm.
well, the London Press don't seem much interested, not very full accounts.
Yes.
useless.
so much for the London Press.
it all seems depressingly simple, what persuaded you to take an interest in this case?
this.
Boscombe Valley mystery.
there has been a grave miscarriage of justice.
the matter is urgent.
we need your help.
please come if you can, Alice Turner.
good heavens, who is Alice Turner?
she is the daughter of Mr. Turner, also Australian who owns this whole estate.
Oh, well it's a mystery, not murder to Miss Turner.
note the "we" Watson, we need your help.
if ever there's a cry from the heart that is that it leaps from the paper.
have you seen this lady?
no, not yet.
do you remember a certain Sergeant Summerby?
Oh, yes, the case of the counterfeit Spanish dollars.
Mexican.
a pleasant fellow much admired your methods did he not?
probably his reason for promotion to Inspector.
he is in charge of the case and it was he who organized this accommodation for us.
us?
you presumed that I would come?
no, not presumed, Watson, hoped, very much hoped.
well, Mr. Holmes and you, Doctor, it's a pleasure to see you again.
congratulations on your promotion, Inspector.
thank you, Doctor.
it's a quiet district as a rule but nonetheless my own.
I have a carriage waiting.
Ah, oh.
mccarthy, the murdered man rented a farm called Havely from a Mr. Turner who is one of the largest London proprietors in this part of the country.
he made his money in Australia.
I presume that both being colonials they had much in common.
old friends, I believe.
well, Mr. Turner has been in failing health for some time.
he has a daughter called Alice?
an only child and a most charming one.
we surmise that Miss Turner and the McCarthy boy are friends?
great friends.
it was Miss Turner who brings me here.
Oh I know, Mr. Holmes, and to be quite honest with you I'm surprised you came.
the case is as plain as a flag staff and the more I get into it the plainer than it comes.
so I have warned Miss Turner that this time not even Mr. Sherlock Holmes will be able to work miracles.
it's a beautiful countryside.
Yes, yes, indeed this is Boscombe Valley.
and over there at the bottom is Boscombe Mirror where the murder took place, a peaceful place for a tragedy.
any witnesses?
I expected that question, Mr. Holmes.
the principle witness is William Crowder, one of Mr. Turner's gamekeepers.
it was after I had me dinner, last Monday it was, the...
the third of June.
Oh, that's right.
now I fed the young pheasants, ports we call them.
you were planting out lettuces.
Oh, that's right,
I was setting out some lettuces, those lettuces over there.
when my little girl, Patience, she comes running up.
dad, dad, the McCarthy's are fighting.
well it won't be the first time.
well, don't you worry about it, Patience, it ain't no concern of ours.
go on, in you go.
that, Mr. McCarthy, he has a temper that one, you know.
you know, if he thought another gun had poached his bird out shooting, he'd let fly in a real fury.
was the boy the same way inclined?
no milk for me, please.
no.
no, not that I've noticed anyway.
no, he always seemed a nice enough boy.
I'm surprised him doing such a thing.
but, then again, he was provoked.
no doubt, who's to say.
you tell the gentlemen what happened next.
what?
you haven't forgotten what you said in evidence at the inquest.
forgotten?
I shant forget that day not so long as I live.
I just sent Patience into her mother and I hadn't planted out no more than another hour box, when Hugh McCarthy come running up looking like he'd seen a ghost.
my father's met with a terrible accident.
please come with me, I need your help.
where is he?
down by the Mirror.
is he alive?
you just come along with me.
I brought him back here and I sent me wife down to the track for the police.
did the boy say anything?
no, no, not a word.
he just sat there where you are, sobbing and moaning and I didn't take me eyes off him until they came for him, that's the truth.
did you examine the gun at all, the butt for instance?
no.
no, not especially, there was a bit of mud on it.
he wiped it.
he wiped it.
well I might've done.
I mean it would've been natural wouldn't it?
there was Mr. McCarthy lying there dead with his head bashed in.
he hadn't got that way swatting wasps had he?
and you believe that the boy killed his father?
well, of course I do, sir.
I mean who else could've done it?
I can tell you this much, gentlemen.
all right, now, I'm a gamekeeper all right and when a man's got a gun in his hand strange things can happen.
Oh, now I've seen men, quiet law abiding gentleman, you put a gun in their hands they turn into near maniacs.
thank you so much, Mr. Crowder, for giving so much of your valuable time.
Oh, it's been a pleasure gentlemen.
it's not the first time I've been able to help the cause of justice, no, not by a long shot.
all right, well last year at Candlemas time, you remember Inspector?
no, I'm a liar, it were two years ago. -Well, we must be on our way.
well, I'm on the side of law and order, sir, the Inspector will tell you that.
indeed you are, Crowder.
thank you.
goodbye.
they're all the same these country people.
once they get an audience they'll talk the hind leg off a donkey.
now if you follow me
I'll take you down to the scene of the crime.
no need for the moment.
that's very true, no need in the circumstances.
it's a sad case, but a pretty clear one, the glass is high.
weather set fair.
I shall like to call on James McCarthy.
I can arrange it if you wish.
tomorrow.
tomorrow.
one more thing I should tell you, Mr. Holmes.
when the boy was charged with the murder, he didn't appear in the least surprised.
in fact, he said it was no more than his desserts, those were his very words.
a confession?
you might think so.
did he also protest his innocence?
Yes.
but then again, they always do don't they?
I think we best be getting back to the hotel.
I have some calls to make on the estate.
until tomorrow then.
Boscombe Arms.
the boy said he got no more than his desserts, well that's a pretty suspicious remark.
I mean, coming after such a damning series of events.
on the contrary the brightest rips I can see in the clouds at present.
Self-approach contrition displayed by his remark appears to be signs of a healthy mind, rather than a guilty one.
many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence.
so they have and many men have been hanged wrongfully.
Oh, look, a pheasant.
mm, witness.
that's James McCarthy.
I had a conversation with my father, which led to high words, and almost to blows.
as his temper was becoming ungovernable,
I left him and went up the hill.
I hadn't gone more than a hundred yards when I heard a hideous outcry, which caused me to run back again.
I found my father expiring on the ground with his head terribly injured.
did you see anyone near your father when you returned?
no, no one.
I have no idea how he came by his injuries.
he was not a popular man, but as far as I know he had no active enemies.
I know nothing further of the matter.
did your father say anything to you before he died?
he mumbled a few words but all I could catch was some allusion to a rat.
silence, be quiet.
a rat?
and what did you understand by that?
it conveyed nothing to me.
I thought, well I thought he was delirious.
what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?
I should prefer not to answer that question, sir.
I'm afraid that I must press it.
it really is impossible for me to tell you but I can assure you that it had nothing to do with the sad tragedy that followed.
that is for the court to decide.
I need hardly point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings, which may arise.
you may sit down.
gentlemen of the jury, you are here to discover the cause of death of Mr. William McCarthy and thereafter to deliver your verdict.
you have heard the facts of this crime and I believe they make the situation very clear.
Mr. James McCarthy's account of his father's dying is singular to say the least.
his refusal to give any details of their last conversation must go very much against him.
the verdict of willful murder seems to me to fit the facts we have heard.
I hope I make myself clear.
so willful murder it was.
monstrous.
well the boy did rather ask for it.
my dear Watson, don't you see that both you and the coroner have been some pains to single out the strongest points in the young man's favor?
don't you see that you're terribly giving credit for much too much imagination or too little.
too little, if he could not invent a quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury.
too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so out as a dying of reference to a rat.
well, these country coroners do think they're little tin pot gods. It's an absolute scandal.
no, no, no.
I shall approach this case from the point of view of what this young man says is true.
we have a visitor.
our young client has arrived.
come in.
I'm so glad you've come, Mr. Holmes.
I'm Alice Turner.
and this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.
Dr. Watson, of course. Miss Turner.
it is you who have written down some of Mr. Holmes' cases in such an interesting way.
you see I know all about you, Mr. Holmes and your wonderful success.
if you knew how much we need you now, but do you yet know anything of what happened?
please sit down Miss Turner.
inspector Summerby has told me something of it.
Oh, yes, the Inspector.
he gave me your address.
he's quite a kind man, isn't he?
but he doesn't understand.
how could he, he's a policeman.
Mr. Holmes, I know that James didn't do it.
I know it and I want you to start your work knowing it too.
never let yourself doubt upon that point.
have you known James McCarthy a long time?
Yes, all my life.
we have known each other since we were children, but he's too tender-hearted to hurt a fly.
this charge is just absurd to anyone who really knows him.
well, I hope that we may clear him.
I shall do all I can.
but from what you've heard already, do you not think he's innocent?
I think it is probable.
I don't know my friend is so convinced.
I think that Mr. Holmes is being a little, a little quick in his conclusions.
but you are right.
Oh, I know that you are right.
James never did it.
this quarrel with his father, which he would not talk about to the coroner, do you know anything of it?
I believe it was because I was concerned in it.
in what way?
it is no time to hide anything now.
James and his father had many disagreements about me.
Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us, but James and I have always loved each other like brother and sister.
of course we haven't seen so much of each other lately.
I have been away at boarding school for some years and James has been studying in Liverpool.
he is only 22 and has seen very little of life and well, I suppose he does not wish to do anything like that just yet.
so there were quarrels.
and this, I'm sure, was one of them.
how old are you, Miss Turner?
I am 18, quite nearly 19.
as you say, this isn't a time to hide anything.
are you in love with James McCarthy?
Yes, I am, Mr. Holmes, very much in love.
there is no one else and never will be even if,
and he with you?
Oh, I think so.
I hope so, but how should I know for sure?
we have never discussed marriage.
was your father in favor of such a union?
no, he was adverse to it.
no one but Mr. McCarthy was in favor of it.
thank you for being so frank with us.
if I was to visit your father could I see him, please?
I'm afraid not.
the doctor has forbidden any visitors.
Oh, I'm sorry, we did not know he was so ill.
my father has never been strong but this has broken him completely.
Oh, he has taken to his bed and Dr. Willow says that he's a wreck and his nervous system is shattered.
well I can hardly leave him or I would've been at the railway station to meet you.
well, you see,
Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Australia.
Australia?
in Victoria at the mines, the gold mines, that's where dad made all his money.
you have been of material assistance to me.
will you be able to see James?
tomorrow.
tell him that I know him to be innocent.
I will.
could you give him this?
of course.
and if you have any news you will tell me?
I must go home now.
I left my father asleep but if he awakes and I'm not there he'll be upset.
goodbye.
goodbye and God help you in your undertaking.
morning Inspector.
may I see him alone, please?
as you wish, Mr. Holmes.
but remember this man is on remand accused of willful murder and as you well know such a man under such circumstances -isn't likely to speak the truth. -Oh, thank you for your good advice.
my name is Sherlock Holmes.
I'm here to help you.
how should I know that?
you came with the police Inspector,
I saw him out there.
I'm here at the request of Miss Turner.
I am sorry, Mr. Holmes.
lately I've learned to trust no one.
I'm afraid you've come too late.
they've already made up their minds that I am guilty.
well, I have not.
the Coroner's court.
Oh yes, and the Coroner's jury, innocent to inquire into the facts.
they do not sit in judgment.
well, how can I help you?
I'd like you to tell me exactly what happened.
let's sit down over here where we can talk quietly and not be overheard.
where shall I start?
you choose.
well, I've been studying in Liverpool for some three years.
my father was most anxious
I should have some academic qualifications.
it was on that day,
june the 3rd that I returned home.
was your father expecting you?
no, no, not exactly.
he knew I was due for a few days holiday, but not the exact date.
our local carrier took me up to the farm from the village.
welcome home, nice to see you back, Master James.
Oh, it's nice to be back, George.
Hey, Stan, Stan?
is my father in the house?
no, no, went off about five minutes ago, looked as though he had something on his mind.
all right, George.
will you be wanting pony later?
no, no, I'll ride tomorrow.
I might have a gun, see if I could pull a few rabbits.
plenty shooting, place is crawling with them.
welcome.
Hello, father.
what are you doing here?
I'm just here for a few days that's all.
well, I don't want you down here so get up out of it, keep away from it, do you understand?
Yes, why?
none of your damn business!
just do as you're told.
look, now you are here get over the Turner's place and tell that girl you'll marry her.
I'll do no such thing.
look, father, we have been through all this before. -Do as I tell you, you damn, disobedient, little bastard.
give me the gun.
give me the gun! -It's my life and
I'm going to run it the way I like.
all right, damn you!
I'll throw you out.
I'll ruin you.
you'll see.
now get off out of it!
I had hardly gone any distance at all when I heard a terrible scream.
I ran back down and found my father lying on his side.
did you see anyone else?
no one.
no movement anywhere?
no, my attention was entirely on my father.
he was terribly wounded.
you would not tell the coroner about this quarrel with your father.
it was something private.
it was no business of his.
was it not because this confrontation with your father might seem to incriminate you?
no, no, it was because it concerned Alice.
it was no business of the coroners or anyone else's.
I wasn't going to have her name bandied about in the courtroom.
you do know that Alice loves you, James and believes you to be innocent.
Yes, I know.
the thought of her love and her faith in me has kept me in some sort of sanity in this horrible place.
and yet you had no wish to marry her as your father so clearly wished?
perhaps you did not share her love?
I did.
I do, Mr. Holmes,
I love Alice Turner.
I, I adore her,
I worship the very ground she treads on, but...
and yet?
I could not ask her to marry me because, because I was married already.
don't you think you'd better tell me about it?
when I first started studying in Liverpool my father gave me a very generous allowance.
perhaps too generous for my own good.
I became very wild and fell in with a bad set of people.
and in a fit of drunken madness
I went through a form of marriage in a register office to a woman much older than I was, a barmaid.
I hardly ever saw Alice at that time.
of course I couldn't tell my father.
he would certainly have thrown me out as he'd so often threatened.
Yes, I'm sure he would.
have you any idea who would've killed your father so brutally?
none whatsoever.
do you know I go over the scene day after day after day in my mind.
but, I am as puzzled as everyone else is.
don't give up hope.
thank you, Mr. Holmes.
Oh, oh, Mr. Holmes?
yeah?
it hardly concerns all this business but perhaps I should tell you.
some good has come out of this evil.
since I've been in here
I received a message from the woman I married who has read in the newspapers that I am in serious trouble and likely to be hanged.
she wrote that she had a husband already in the Bermuda dockyard.
good heavens!
so, there is no legal tie between us.
if only I had known before.
you were right to tell me.
poor fellow.
must've been maddening to be upbraided by his father for not doing something he would give his very eyes to do.
if he's innocent, who did it?
indeed.
well perhaps I can help.
I've not been entirely idle in your absence.
now in the surgeon's deposition of the inquest it states that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone were shattered by blows from a blunt weapon.
now that's here now behind but the evidence states that they were quarreling face to face.
that's a very nice piece of deduction, Watson.
thank you.
but hardly a valid one.
McCarthy could've easily turned his back the moment the girl had run off.
but I'm so glad that you're coming around to my way of thinking and Miss Turner's.
the boy is innocent.
now, Holmes you're putting words in my mouth,
I didn't say that.
but you're thinking it just a little.
these boots were the ones the master was wearing at the time he was murdered, sir.
I've cleaned them off since, of course.
those, those are a pair of Master James's.
he bought them new last .
thank you, George, now let's get onto the Mirror.
this is the place, Mr. Holmes.
you can still see traces of the blood.
please, would you keep clear of this area?
why did you enter the Mirror, Inspector?
fished them out with a rack, thought there might be some weapon thrown there or some other trace.
if only I'd been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it.
this must be the gamekeeper and his gang.
these tracks are young McCarthy's
and these.
twice he walked.
he turned.
once he ran so the soles of the feet are deeply marked, the heels are hardly visible.
that would bear out his story he ran when he saw his father on the ground.
the father paced up and down right here.
what have we here?
tiptoes.
tiptoes.
square toes most unusual boots.
where did mister square toes come from?
he'd a made a rare bloodhound Mr. Holmes.
it has been a case of considerable interest.
come.
thank you, George.
thank you, sir.
would you deliver this note?
Yes, sir, indeed.
right away.
this may interest you Inspector.
the murder was done with it.
I can see no marks.
there are none.
well, how do you know then?
the grass was growing under it.
it had only been there a few days.
it corresponds with the injuries.
and the murderer?
he's a tall man, left handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting boots with square toes, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar holder and carries a blunt pen knife in his pocket.
you're a brilliant man, Mr. Holmes, and I wish I had your brains.
your theories are all very well but I'm still not convinced.
not this time.
we have to deal with a hardheaded British jury.
well, you've had your chance, Inspector.
I'm a practical man, Mr. Holmes,
I cannot undertake to go around the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with the gamey leg, unless I become the laughing stock of Cheshire.
we shall see.
you work your method,
I shall work mine.
now, let us take this morning's work.
from my examination of the ground，I gained details as to the personality of the criminal.
Uh-huh.
but how?
you know my method.
it's founded on the observance of trifles.
well, his height I know you might roughly judge by the length of his stride, his boots by his traces but the man's nameless.
the impression of his right foot was always left distinct than that of the left.
Why? Because he limped.
he's left-handed, the blow was delivered from immediately behind him yet he was on the left-hand side.
Watson.
he must've been a left-handed man, of course.
he stood behind that tree during the confrontation between father and son.
he even smoked.
smoked?
cigar ash.
an Indian cigar.
you will remember my little monograph on the subject of ashes from pipe, cigar and cigarette tobacco.
one hundred different varieties if I remember.
one hundred and forty, thank you, Watson.
having discovered the ash, I discovered this stump which the man had thrown among the moss.
an Indian cigar rolled in Rotterdam.
you'll notice that the end has not been in his mouth so he used a cigar holder.
the tip has been cut off, not bitten, but the cut is not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt penknife.
you're amazing.
among the words mumbled by the dying man.
the only word that young McCarthy could understand was the word rat.
rat, hmm.
most curious.
come with me.
now.
what do you read?
a rat.
and now?
Balla-rat, Ballarat.
that is the word the man uttered.
australia.
someone from Ballarat, what is Ballarat known for?
Goldfield.
miss Turner said that her father had met McCarthy on the Goldfield.
I see the direction, which all this points.
an Australian from Ballarat and one who is at home in the district.
unless I'm very much mistaken, he's here.
Mr. John Turner.
Mr. Holmes.
Dr. Watson.
my daughter told me you were lodging here.
did you get my note?
Yes, yes, something about coming here to avoid a scandal.
better than meeting up at the hall, people might talk.
why do you wish to see me?
Oh, yes.
I know all about you and McCarthy.
my friend Watson will jot down a few facts.
I promise it will not be used unless it is absolutely needed.
do sit down.
you didn't know the dead man McCarthy.
he was a devil incarnate.
God keep you out of the clutches of a man such as he.
his grip has been upon me these many years and he's blasted my life.
I'll tell you first how I came to be in his power.
it was in the early 60's at the diggings.
I was a young chap then, hot blooded and reckless.
well, I had no luck with me claim, took to the bush and came what you'd call a highway robber.
there was a little gang of us who lived a wild free life of it.
sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagon on the road from the diggings.
they called me Black Jack of Ballarat.
I believe they still remember the Ballarat gang in the colony.
the wagon driver was McCarthy and I spared him.
get out of it!
go on, shift!
don't bother , fast!
we got away with the gold.
and Mac and I were wealthy men beyond the dreams of Everest.
there was...
there was...
there was a price on our heads.
I decided to make for England.
I determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life.
I bought this estate that included the whole village even this inn is mine.
I set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which I'd earned it.
I married and then my darling wife died young.
she left me my dear little Alice.
I was a happy man you might say, until McCarthy laid his grip upon me.
he followed my trail, when he first came here, he'd hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.
here we are, Jack," he said,
you can have the keeping of us, me and my little boy, and if you don't,
england is a fine law-abiding country and there's always a policeman handy.
I was a sitting duck for blackmail.
there was no shaking him off, there was no rest, no peace, no forgetfulness.
turn there I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at me elbow.
whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was
I gave him without question.
land, money, houses until at last he asked the thing I could not give.
he asked for Alice.
his son and my girl had grown up.
he knew I was in weak health.
it seemed a fine stroke to him that his son should step into the whole property.
there I was firm.
I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine.
not that I had any dislike for the lad, but his father's blood was in him and that was enough.
I stood firm.
McCarthy threatened,
I braved him to do his worst.
we arranged to meet at the Mirror, halfway between our two houses to talk it over.
do as you're told.
as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter seemed to come upper most and he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as a slut from off the streets.
we have been through all this before. -Do as I tell you, boy, you damn disobedient little bastard.
it drove me mad to think that I and all that I held dear should be in the power of such a man.
it's my life and I'm going to run it the way I like.
I was a dying and desperate man.
if I could silence that foul tongue I could still save me and my family's reputation in this valley.
get off out of it.
I did it, Mr. Holmes, and I would do it again.
deeply though I've sinned
I've lived a life of martyrdom to atone for it.
if my girl should become entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer.
I struck him down with no more compunction than if he'd been some foul and venomous beast.
that is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred.
it is not for me to judge you, but I hope that we may never expose to such temptation.
I pray not, sir.
I'm a dying man.
I've had the diabetes for years.
my doctor says it's a question of whether I shall live a month and I'd rather die under me own roof than in a jail.
no, McCarthy must be got off, however.
God help me but I wouldn't let that young man come to harm.
I'll give you my word that I'd have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes.
I'm very glad to hear you say so.
I'd have spoken now if it had not been for my dear girl.
it would break her heart.
it'll break her heart when she hears that I'm arrested.
it may not come to that.
we're not the police.
I am no official agent.
I'm here at your daughter's request.
Alice? -Alice.
then what do you intend to do?
in view of your health, nothing.
you are yourself aware that you'll have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes.
if young McCarthy's condemned
I shall be forced to use this confession.
if not, it will never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe.
farewell then.
your own deathbeds when they come a little bit easier for a thought of the peace that you've given to mine.
Oh, god, help us.
Turner, John Stewart, 16th of August,
Boscombe Hall Cheshire.
after a long illness, bravely born, beloved father of Alice.
well, we're free to use that confession at young McCarthy's trial.
no, by no means.
my promise was it would not be used unless McCarthy is condemned and I think I've given enough objections to the charge to insure his acquittal.
well, I hope so.
I love you.
I love you too.
will you marry me?
Yes, I will.
a happy ending to a brilliant case.
I congratulate you, Holmes.
I thank you.
I must admit there are certain aspects to this case, which even I did not anticipate.
one chick, fully feathered, two adults.
empty nest.
last one. One chick, fully feathered, two adults.
horrible system forecast from the East later.
Yeah, I saw that. Finlay!
Hey, kiddo. You arrive OK, then?
I did, thanks. And I forgot how cold it was over here.
so, aside from cold, how is it? 'Windy!'
why couldn't you've been born in, like, the Caribbean instead of Fair Isle?'
ahh... You know I'd miss the rain.
I'm sorry I can't be there.
how's that pile of paperwork anyway? I'm getting through it. CEILIDH MUSIC PLAYS 'Is that music I can hear?' Yeah. We're just about to go in.
well, tell your gran and grandad that I'm asking for them and have a good time with Angus.
and, you know, you behave yourselves.
we will. Love you. And I...
Hey. How's your dad? Fine, I think. Yeah.
you forgot to ask, didn't you? Sort of. But he sounded fine.
Ah, yes! Thank you, Frank. Thanks, Frank.
there you are, son. Come on.
happy birthday. Happy birthday.
Cheers! Cheers!
there's Angus! The happiest of birthdays to you.
happy birthday, Angus.
happy birthday, Angus.
Hey! I'm good, how are you?
how many times have you and your wife wished each other a happy anniversary today?
haven't you heard? Absence makes the heart grow fond of texting.
you're like a pair of Canada Geese.
honk, honk to you, my sad, unpaired friend.
ha! Unpaired I may be.
sad about it?
no.
Peter, could I have a word?
are you lot going to join in the festivities or are you going to stay in here like a bunch of antisocial lab rats?
bit busy right now, Frank.
working in here isn't a judgment against dancing through there.
Yes, but it doesn't hurt to let the islanders know that we're reasonably normal, and not just totally obsessed with their bird life.
Oh, I am totally obsessed with their bird life. So am I.
Anna, please. It just helps.
Oh, for God's sake. You wanted a word, Anna?
Oh, yeah. You two go ahead.
first drink on me?
first? How many do you have in mind?
well, as many as it takes until we lose count.
well? Close the door.
close the door...and lock.
just closed will be fine.
drink, please. I'll get it.
you're all right, Finlay, I'll take it from here.
little tip. Better to chat her up away from the husband.
what are you doing here?
right, this is my wife Tessa, Frank Blake.
hang on, say that again.
radio: 'overnight to storm force ten that will be accompanied 'by heavy driving rain.
due to the conditions, the airport is expected to shut down within the hour.
this will make travel between the Mainland 'and Fair Isle impossible for the next 24 hours...'
there!
are you all right, darling? Yeah.
bumpy flight, I take it?
aye... Just a bit.
good to see you, Jimmy. You too, Dad.
this is my colleague, Detective Sergeant Alison McIntosh.
Hello, sorry, I'm not always this shade of puce.
Jimmy's mother's the same. It's the boat for her every time.
right, now, let's get these things loaded up.
given how much time we've already lost, it's probably best if we just crack on.
did you manage to keep everybody away from the laboratory?
I got Donnie down there and he's put everything on lockdown.
and Isobel is with the family.
the weather is probably going to shut Lerwick down for 24 hours at least.
so we are on our own, Dad.
we're all devastated, Jimmy. I know.
there hasn't been an unlawful killing on Fair Isle for 70 years. And even that was caused by the Luftwaffe.
people are scared.
you're their lay preacher, Dad, just do your best to reassure them.
hopefully, you'll be able to wrap this up pretty sharpish.
one of the scientists at the Centre hasn't been seen since last night.
Peter Latimer. What does that mean?
I'm just saying that if I was a bookie,
I wouldn't take any bets on who did it.
it's probably just as well you're not a bookie then, Dad.
aye, well.
right, better get started here.
dad, can take you Tosh down to the harbour and see if there's any boats missing.
but can you take Cass home first? Sure.
and if a boat is missing? Main island coastguard?
Aye.
if he's headed north, that'll almost certainly mean a recovery operation.
that stretch between here and Shetland is notorious.
even locals like myself struggle to navigate it.
well, I'm sure they are aware of that, Dad.
can I help you with that?
I'm Finlay Caulfield.
I was Anna's assistant.
we've been waiting for you, actually.
we thought you wouldn't get here before they shut down the transits.
I'm Detective Inspector Perez.
could I see Doctor Blake's body now, if you don't mind?
the body is in the lab, just through here.
I'll be fine from here, thanks.
well, there's no vessels missing.
Really? OK.
so then, this Latimer is still on the island.
is that a good thing or bad? Who owns these huts?
well, that's the, err...
the fishermen there and this belongs to the Research Centre.
shouldn't we be getting straight back?
just need to check these, he could be hiding until dark.
aye, well, there is that.
Hey, wake up.
Hey, Donnie, good to see you.
and you, big man. And you.
just wish it was under slightly different circumstances, obviously.
Aye.
anything?
no, nothing here. And you?
same.
sir, there aren't any boats missing and there are no signs of anyone trying to hide nearby either.
OK, keep looking and...
listen, I want you to ask my dad if we can set up an incident room in the village hall.
also, I've made a start on the crime scene, but I just need to check something and then I'll start feeding information through to Sandy. OK?
he's gone out for a cigarette. I thought this might prove useful...
am I right in saying that visiting researchers would be given a front door key? That's correct.
and so, who would have a full set?
that would be the three permanent members of staff.
that's the Blakes and myself. They're hung up in the office.
and were they still there this morning? Yes.
are these bedrooms? Erm...yes.
that's mine. Erm... That's Bill's.
Latimer's.
that's Anna's. And that's Frank's.
so, Dr Blake and her husband, they slept apart?
Yeah.
OK.
I'm so sorry, Frank.
well, in the old days, if I'd have thought of hiding out,
I would head for the lighthouses up at Skroo or at Skadden.
good vantage points over the whole island.
why the old days? Well, they've both been automated for years, so they're completely locked up, your man couldn't get in.
could he break in? Unlikely.
you still want to check them out, eh? Please...
Aye. Good! Good!
listen, thanks for standing guard.
Oh, not at all, not at all. I am only happy to help.
bit weird though, ain't it? Aye.
listen, I just wanted to check something with you.
has anybody been in or out of that lab since the body was found?
no.
not since I was there, no. You're sure?
positive, aye. Right. OK.
Isobel and Angus are looking forward to seeing you.
did he like his present? He loved it, Jimmy.
I know I've not been the most hands-on of godfathers...
no, no, listen, we understand.
you and me, we'll get a chance to have a proper catch up later, eh.
aye, aye, sure. Aye. You get on now.
I'll see you later. Right.
there is severe bruising at the left temple...
but not on the right.
and there's another bruise on the right cheek.
but there's...
there's no other signs of physical injury.
OK. Got that.
there's signs of a violent struggle within the room,
but there are no blood spatter on the floor...
or the walls, and there's no blood emanating from anywhere on the body.
dr Blake's computer is still running, which suggests that she didn't have time to shut it down before the attack,
and it's password protected.
OK. OK.
some sort of altercation has taken place, during which Anna Blake has received a severe blow to the left temple...
and she's died.
but the question is...with what?
would you say Anna Blake was popular with the locals?
Anna was all about the work. And Frank looked after everything else.
but fair play to her.
she kept this island's profile right up there all over the world, and that put money in everybody's pocket.
who's that?
that's him. That's Peter Latimer.
right. Pull in here.
my name is Detective Sergeant McIntosh.
if you're thinking of running, Mr Latimer, number one
I was a cross-country champion and number two... Why would I think of running?
where have you been?
come on, Sandy, that's 20 minutes.
they're coming. They're coming. Have you got them yet?
I have got them. Finally. I will send them straight to Inverness.
I need anything that illuminates the choreography of her final moments.
I also want you to pull the phone records for Anna's lab phone.
cos I want to know who she was talking to in the last few weeks.
and you want her mobile too?
Yes, if I can find it. All right?
OK, good.
sir?
tosh. I've got Latimer.
where was he?
we found him walking back to the Centre.
apparently, he's researching changing migration patterns.
he told me he left the Centre early because he'd received news that eight Icterine Warblers had been reported flying south, and he didn't want to miss them if they flew over the island.
it's apparently why he stayed out so long...waiting.
did he have binoculars?
a camera? Notebook?
he claims he slipped on a path on the cliff top, lost his grip on his backpack, and watched it tumble into the sea.
well, then, he wouldn't have known that Anna was dead.
he gave no indication that he did.
did you say anything to him?
all he knows is that there was "an incident" at the Centre. Good.
I've asked him to wait alone in one of the reading rooms for the moment.
OK.
well, I'll speak to him after I've spoken to Anna's family.
your father made a couple of calls and says the village hall's ours for as long as we need it.
excellent. He's a connected man, your dad.
Yeah, well, I suppose when you live on an island with 70 people, being "connected" isn't a bigger deal as you'd think.
plus he is the lay preacher and that gives him a certain...status, which he does enjoy.
right. I'll talk to Frank, you search Latimer's room.
because if he did kill Anna, then, he almost certainly left the Centre early so he could dump whatever he killed her with into the Atlantic, but see if you can find anything else in there that links him to Anna.
mr and Mrs Warren?
Yes, that's right. If there's anything we can do...
well, at some point, my colleague Detective Sergeant McIntosh is going to have to take separate statements from you both regarding where you were last night.
is that really necessary? We were together the whole evening.
we'll be as quick as we can.
Thanks, Isobel.
they're both in shock.
it's good to have you home, Jimmy.
I am sorry for your loss.
I am going to have to ask you a few questions, Frank, it's probably best if we do it now.
Joe, would you mind waiting outside?
have the police given any indication when we can return to our rooms?
Tessa needs to lie down. This has been a terrible shock.
did she know Anna?
did she have to? To be horrified by what happened to her?
the police have told us to remain downstairs until told otherwise.
would your wife like a cup of tea?
it would only upset her stomach.
something to eat? I could make her a sandwich.
Thanks, I doubt she would keep it down.
I wasn't going to fill it full of puffin shit...
you supercilious arse.
when was the last time that you saw your wife?
when I turned in.
at what time was that? Can you remember?
about one. Was the dance finished by then?
had everybody gone home?
but by one o'clock, as far as you know, the only people who were left at the Centre were the people who were living and working here.
as far as I know.
and none of those people would have had any reason to attack your wife?
she was my wife.
I should have protected her.
can you name those people for me?
I'm sorry, Frank, I know this is insensitive, but I just have to ask...
can I get you a glass of water or something? -No.
no, no, I'm fine. OK.
you want me to name the people who were staying here, OK.
Yes, please. OK.
it was myself, Anna, our son, Joe...
bill Warren and his wife, who turned up to surprise him on their wedding anniversary.
OK?
thank you.
did you often go to bed before your wife?
you don't become pre-eminent in your field without putting in the hours.
so she worked hard?-Ferociously hard.
did you resent that?
in our field, we don't resent those who are cleverer or more insightful than us.
we applaud it, we're grateful for it.
cos in the end, it moves us all forward.
so it was because of her hours then that you slept apart?
don't waste your time by reading anything into that.
our marriage was fine.
so where was Anna when you said good night to her?
in the lab, working...with Peter Latimer. -Working?
with all due respect, shouldn't you be talking to somebody who wasn't in their bed when she was killed?
I mean, wouldn't that be more useful?
was there anything unusual in your wife working with Peter Latimer late? - - There was nothing unusual.
she oversaw all the research here.
and he's a postgraduate student.
right, so you locked up... Yes.
and you said good night to your wife...
Yes.
and you went to bed. -Yes.
now, go on and find out who killed her before I do.
excuse me...
Sandy... The pathologist's had a look at your photographs, she's got a possible cause of death for you.
extradural haemorrhage, it's caused when a blow to the temple damages blood vessels running to the top of the brain.
this results in bleeding within the skull.
and if left unchecked, it simply pushes the brain down through the base of the skull and into the top of the spinal column.
so it's the base of the brain that controls the breathing and when it's squashed, it just simply stops working.
any word on Anna's phone records yet?
hopefully on there way to me now.
all right.
while we're waiting, I have a couple of names that I want you to run through the PNC.-OK.
a Dr Frank Blake, 'Emeritus Professor of Biology at Birmingham University.'
birmingham Uni.
and Peter Latimer.
postgraduate student in Avian Biology at Oxford University.
Peter Latimer, Oxford.
I'll get Tosh to e-mail you the rest.
and then you get back to me as soon as you hear anything, OK?
will do.
excuse me. Are you with the police?
I'm Detective Inspector Perez. -Excellent.
then perhaps you can tell me what's going on and why I'm being cooped up in here?
OK... Well, let's not talk out here.
what's going on...is a murder investigation.
a murder? Yes.
on the island here?
dr Blake was found murdered in the lab, this morning.
Anna? I didn't say which Dr Blake.
sorry. I just assumed.
no, well, you're right, it was Anna, I'm afraid.
christ almighty!
wha...what happened?
her body was found in the lab this morning by Finlay Caufield.
and I have to say your absence from the building seemed to cause...
quite a stir.
I explained to your colleague... I... Yes.
Icterine Warblers.
Yes. If the sighting was correct, it's significant cause for concern.
well, it's not as significant as the woman you've been working alongside for the last few months being found dead in her lab, surely.
no. No. Of course not, I was just trying to explain its significance.
sorry, I...
I...think I'm in shock.
can I ask you something?
how did you find out about the arrival of these birds?
Warblers? Was it e-mail?
was it a text? Or what was it?
it was an RSS feed.
and did anyone else get this feed?
no, no... No, I don't think so.
bring it up for me.
I think I should speak to a solicitor.
there is a storm on the Mainland, you're not going to be able to get a solicitor here for at least 48 hours. Why don't you just talk to me?
I didn't kill Anna Blake. -I didn't say you did.
no, but you think I did. You don't know what I'm thinking.
one thing's for sure - you didn't leave this building this morning to spot eight birds prematurely flying south for the winter.
so...
don't insult my intelligence.
well... Latimer wants a solicitor.
you know, I've told him, with the weather coming in, he's unlikely to get one for at least 48 hours, but he's adamant.
do we take that as an admission of guilt?
his backpack and equipment aren't here. He maintains he didn't kill her.
although, you know "I didn't" can turn into "I didn't mean to."
but then, it's possible he's telling the truth about that and lying about why he...
there's someone.
Finlay? I thought I asked everybody to stay downstairs.
Oh, there was something I needed for work. So quite urgent then?
urgent enough to disobey a direct police instruction during a murder inquiry?
I just thought it wouldn't matter if I nipped up here briefly, and got what I needed and... It does matter.
what did you come up for?
well, I thought it was up here, but... Finlay, you're beginning to annoy me just a wee bit.
just answer the question. Well, it must be down in the lab.
what? The memory card, that one that you're holding in your left hand.
you can stand there looking glaikit all day if you want, I don't mind, or you can give me the card.
LOOK...IT'S not what it looks like.
if you're going to think on your feet, you'll have to be a wee bit quicker than that.
and don't you even think about swallowing that.
trust me, on the way out, it'll hurt you a lot more than it will me.
now, for the last time...
.Give me the card.
see... Why would you do that?
where were you last night? Look at me.
don't turn your bloody back on me. Get off me!
where were you last night? -What is wrong with you?
where were you? Do you think I'm bloody stupid?'
do you think I'm bloody stupid?! Do you?
do you?!
do you think I'm bloody stupid?! -Frank!
leave him!
you were in the lab with her last night!
that means nothing. Means nothing.
means nothing.
take a minute.
just think about your boy.
the last thing he needs is his old man in a jail cell right now.
I'm not stupid. You understand?
I'm not stupid.
so I take it everybody on the island knows about the killing?
what do you think?
people are scared, Jim. Fair Isle doesn't do crime, remember?
don't you miss that, Jimmy?
sure, who wouldn't miss that.
so what do you prefer about Lerwick then?
honestly? -Go on.
well, it's where I met Fran.
it's where Cassie was born.
it's where her dad lives.
and plus it's about the right size for me.
you know, if you want people to know your business, then, you can share it with them and if you don't, you don't have to.
you have no choice here.
Aye.
does he not know how busy you are?
Jimmy's here! -Jim?
what?
what about him?
any idea why he would come back during term time?
how do you mean? When did he come back?
last night.
right. I didn't know that...
it doesn't matter.
coffee? -Yeah.
here he is, my favourite godson! -I'm your only godson!
how are you? -Good.
good. Thanks.
thanks so much for the iPad, by the way.
that was the right...thing then?
bloody brilliant. -Bloody expensive.
you're only 18 once. -Exactly...
I remember when I was 18.
do you remember when you were 18, Jimmy?
right, Angus, I've got a problem.
actually, I've got two problems.
three if you include not being able to count.
this is problem number one.
that's easy. They don't usually work without the camera.
no, no, no. Seriously now.
can you get the photographs that were on that?
hi there, my wife Mary thought you might be hungry after losing your breakfast on the way over.
nothing heavy, just food for a tender tummy.
that's very kind of her. I'll leave it with...
how could someone do that to a beautiful and intelligent woman?
I just pray that it wasn't an islander.
does that really matter, Mr Perez?
for us, it does. This community survives on mutual trust.
this could completely destroy it.
who would have thought it, eh?
our old village hall - an incident room. Well, needs must, I'm afraid.
excuse me... Sorry.
Yes, Sandy... Tosh.
according to Anna Blake's phone records, two weeks back, she called the airline flying between Fair Isle and Tingwall.
he's on a diet.
so I requested details of any flights booked in her name and there were two same-day return tickets to Tingwall on the 23rd of last month, a week and a half ago.
and the name of the second passenger?
well, it's damaged.
Yeah.
but as long as the flash memory on the card is intact and the internal circuit board isn't cracked, it should be possible to retrieve the files.
come on, Angus, how long is this going to take?
you're back on Fair Isle now, Uncle Jimmy.
the land where time doesn't just stand still, it frequently loses its internet connection.
Ah, here we go.
uncle Jimmy? -What?
you haven't told me about problem number two!
aye, I'll speak to you later!
he retrieved the data? -He did indeed. There you go, stick it in.
do you think it's worth getting him to take a look at Anna's laptop? Unofficially.
if I can't crack it, I'm just going to leave it with him, and just let his natural, geek-like curiosity run its course...
Oh, Sandy called.
Anna Blake booked two same-day return flights to Lerwick a week and a half ago.
why two?
one for herself. The other for Peter Latimer.
and why would Anna and Peter Latimer go to the main island just for the day?
I can't imagine！
why would a beautiful woman, married to an older man, want to get away from the prying eyes of Fair Isle to spend an afternoon alone with an attractive student?
if that was the case, they could just have slipped behind the bike sheds.
why go all the way to the main island? -You think?
I mean...Frank maintains that the reason they slept separately was because she worked all hours.
Yeah, but he would say that, wouldn't he?
and I did get the impression that he did love her very much.
Yeah, but did she still love him? What is he, in his fifties?
no offence, but it would be like me fancying you. -Thanks very much
the fact that he loved her like he did means he could have been capable of killing her in a jealous rage.
he's got it in him - if we hadn't come in when we did,
Latimer could be dead. -Before you go too far down that road, just have a look at the contents of Finlay's camera.
if she was the last Icterine Warbler on Earth, this number of pictures would be excessive... Uh-huh.
he is totally obsessed.
the only one he doesn't have is Anna dead.
was she sexually assaulted?
well, we'll need the results from the post mortem, but it didn't look like it, no...
right, let's say it's Finlay.
he's been here for the best part of a year.
why last night, what was the trigger?
has a few drinks at the party for Dutch courage.
comes on to Anna in the lab.
get's rebuffed.
humiliated and angry...
the fact that he tried to destroy the memory card gives us enough to arrest and question him at least.
that's me heading out, Billy. -In this weather?
I've got a lead on Finlay Caulfield. I'm going to check it out.
I'll not be long.
where is she, where's Mum?
they took her away.
where?
they moved her somewhere safe, then they're going to take her to the Mainland.
I want to see her.
I don't think that's a good idea. -That's not your decision to make.
I think it is, I'm your father.
be good if you'd acted like it a bit sooner.
listen, I don't want to argue with you.
I'm just trying to protect you.
I don't want your last memory of your mother to be...
her corpse.
Yes.
you can't control the way I feel.
could you tell me where I might find Gina?
she's over there. -Thank you.
detective Constable Wilson. Might I have a word?
what about? -Finlay Caulfield.
maybe we could take a seat, if you have minute?
thank you.
I'm sorry for bringing up the past like this.
it's all right, what do you want to know?
you met Finlay at a singles club, here at the library?
that's right.
and you went out on a date?
just a drink, really.
I wasn't interested in seeing him after that, so I gently knocked it on the head.
the male ego does bruise easily.
but by that time, he had your e-mail address, is that right?
Yep, that was a mistake.
and he started pestering you?
he wanted to see me again.
I just kept saying no till the e-mails stopped.
then, after a month, I started getting e-mails from a different address.
each one wordless, but with a different attachment.
Gina, what was in the attachments?
photographs of me going about my life.
you know, normal stuff.
but it was creepy.
I was completely unaware he was watching me like that.
did he ever threaten you physically?
no. Never.
and now, no more e-mails?
no, thankfully.
why do you think they stopped?
so... What was her answer?
she said that after receiving a police caution for harassing her, she'd heard he left town for the job on Fair Isle at the Research Centre.
right. That's great work, Sandy.
have you heard anything yet about where Anna Blake and Peter Latimer checked into for their....secret tutorial?
not yet, but it'll take a while for everyone to check their records.
OK, well, just remember they might have used false names, so while you're waiting for something to happen, start trawling through the CCTV between the times of their flights in and out of Tingwall.
will do. -Anything that will help get a confession out of Latimer before his solicitor arrives is going to be great.
because, you know, there are 70 souls on a very small island,
sandy, and one of them is a murderer. People are getting scared.
OK? Bye then.
right, bring me Finlay Caulfield, will you?
Hi, Dad.
I missed you today. -I missed you too.
I am sorry about that.
it's OK. You can't help it. -I'll make it up to you.
you don't have to.
cas, did you know that Joe was coming back to the island last night?
why would I?
well... No, I just thought maybe he might of mentioned it on Facebook or Twitter or...
OK, we both know they are the only two social networking sites you've ever heard of.
I know Joe, but we're not really friends.
ask your father when they want their tea?
nan wants to know what time you want to...
what in God's name...?
what was that?
I don't know. We can go and have a look in the Land Rover.
we don't have a key. And I can't find anyone.
we're on Fair Isle... Keys'll be in the ignition.
it sounded like it came from Donnybrook.
I didn't grow up here, remember? Be less specific!
that way.
Tosh, be careful.
what's happened?
dad, stay where you are.
what is it? What's happened?
who is it?
it's Peter Latimer.
he's not breathing. -Oh, dear God!
next Time
are you any closer to finding out who actually killed her?
I mean, it's an island, how difficult can it be?
for the sake of this wee lump of rock, Jimmy, catch this person.
I never would have hurt Anna and I never hurt Gina.
scared Gina though.
what's going on? Why did you question Donnie?
talk to me about Joe Blake. Now.
I need to speak to you.
OK.
I know who killed my mother.
my secret wish list: 1. that I won't have to have a party 2. that Elin will look at me 3. that Elin will fall in love with me
I love Elin!
what the hell are you doing?!
I hate you! - Calm down.
you're a jerk. - You bloody idiot!
what the hell are you doing? I hate you!
stop it. What are you doing? - You can ask Elin!
I don't understand... I'm so tired of this!
I've been working all night. - Sorry. We didn't mean to wake you.
what am I going to wear now?! - What was it this time?
she took the last of the chocolate milk. - She took the last of the chocolate milk?
we wish that she'll live to be a hundred years old.
Yes, she will live long. Yes, she will live long.
Yes, she will live to be a hundred years old.
cheers for Agnes on her sixteenth birthday...
I'll just roll up the blind. - Blow out your candles, dear.
good! - Birthday hug.
happy birthday. Imagine, you're sixteen now.
Hi. - Hi. Do you live here?
no. I just had to do something here.
want a ride? You can take the helmet. - No, I'll walk.
are you going to Christian's tonight? - Maybe.
maybe I'll see you there. Okay... bye.
was it the right CD? - Yes, thanks.
I listened to it when I was in the shop.
I thought it was... It's actually quite good.
have you given out invites? - No, but I will.
you don't have to. I did them in case...
you did them because Mum told you to. - Yes, I did. But it's your party.
it's Mum's party. - No, it's your birthday.
it's your party and if you...
if you don't feel like inviting anyone, then...
but I will.
it's not odd when you're new somewhere.
that it's difficult finding friends in the beginning.
in the beginning? Dad, we've been here for two years.
no. We moved here in June, that's one and a half.
I will give them out! - But you don't have to. Agnes.
here. - Thanks.
I'm apparently having a party. - You?
no. - Let's see.
stop it. - Oh, I must go...
give me my invite! - Please, can't I come too?
stop it! - Please...
Jessica. I'm sorry...
I'll never pour chocolate milk on you again.
sorry. I'm so stupid. - Yes, you are.
...to page 48. Then we'll have a test.
and we'll read from chapter six to the end of chapter eight.
Elin, are you asleep?
I can just tell you that...
escape, disappearance.
Fuge - No, Fugue.
Oh... bus...
I just don't want to. - You got your period?
you're so bloody irritable. - Not at all!
I just don't want to go to Christian's party.
it's mild weather.
I want to go to a rave. - To a rave?!
or we could mug a pensioner. - You're sick in your mind!
you're so boring! - We could go to Agnes' party.
which Agnes? - Agnes, aren't you having a party?
ignore it. - I hate her.
everything's so boring. - Just ignore it.
I hate my life!
Agnes.
I'm going to stop breathing.
Hey, Agnes, we'll come to the party!
What're you doing in my room?
checking for my ice skates. - Why'd they be here?
Jessica? Fetch my skirt, I can't wear these.
Oh, God. I don't know how to have it.
I'm so beautiful! - My stomach...
I'm going to be Miss Sweden. - You're too little.
Why? How old do you have to be?
you're too small, you're too short. - I'm going to be it anyway.
shit. Where's my skirt? - What skirt?
my skirt, didn't you bring my skirt?
Elin, are you completely... Are you thinking of going out like that?
no, I was just going to use the mirror and...
good God...
that's the way it is. - We can't go out because I wasn't wearing any pants?
you're still too immature to understand you can't go around like that?
imagine if it'd been someone else? - Yes, imagine!
imagine if I'd be embarrassed myself? Get a mirror so we don't go out there.
we had a lovely mirror, but someone broke it.
you're nagging... - Mum, it was just the lift.
she wasn't going to go out. - Let this be a lesson.
it doesn't hurt being at home. I don't like you going out to raves...
mum, it isn't a rave, it's just a normal party.
it's Elin who goes on about raves. - It's decided.
but, we've never even been to a rave.
you know that raves are out? I read it in a magazine. They were in an "out" list.
where does it say they're out?
here, somewhere.
when something's in it takes so long to get here.
it's out already because we're so fucking behind!
we can't stay here, we have to move! - I'm working tonight.
you can stay here together and have fun. I bought crips and soft drinks.
well done, Elin. Great to be home. - Goodbye.
we'll leave later, she can't check.
how many did you invite? - A few.
but I'm not sure they'll... - I'll put everything out.
then they can sit where they like. - What's that smell?
it's roast beef in the oven. - Great! How appropriate!
I thought...
your daughter's vegetarian and you're serving meat. Fantastic!
but, sweetheart...
I thought we could take a few of these. Look.
can't we take some of these? Novalukol.
Novalukol Novum.
you can't swallow them. - "30 lozenges for cases of heartburn."
but if you take a lot...? - No, it won't work.
there's nothing to drink. What about this?
long vital. Herb and vitamin tablets." Drop it, Elin...
what about Alvidon? - Come on! Nothing'll happen.
yes... But I want to take some drugs!
but nothing'll happen. - Yes it will.
no, no it won't. - Yeah.
I'll do something else. Fall in love. - I thought you were.
with who? The Italian? - He wasn't Italian.
he said he was. I always wanted an Italian.
Where'd he come from? Bosnia? - Something like that.
he wasn't Italian, anyway. Aren't you in love with him anymore?
no, that was yesterday. - You should think of your reputation.
stop complaining. You're just the same.
you've had as many as me. - No I haven't.
have. - Haven't.
no? But you sleep with them. I don't. - Only one.
no one's putting anything in me.
fingers maybe... - And that's Markus.
Ah, Markus... - I only sleep with one...
I haven't slept with anyone, anyway. - No, but you've necked about 70, 000.
so what? - You know people are talking?
Really? You know what zero times zero is? That's how much I care.
they won't do it when I'm a film star.
they'll just proudly say they knew me.
went to the same school. "There's their house" and stuff...
Johan, you owe me 100 crowns. Where's your wallet?
you'll get it.
give it here. - I see...
must have been my brother. - Sure. Johan...
Elin?
I just think she's nice. - 'Course she's nice, but...
know how many she's been with? - No.
everyone's been with her.
not me. - She's not worth having.
I think she's worth having. - Jesus, you're 17 and she's 14.
that's three years. Jessica is 16.
there's one year between us. Three between you.
makes no odds if you like each other. - Shall I talk to her?
I can call and fix it. See if she's going to the party.
listen, Johan wants to know something about Elin.
is Elin going to the party?
Johan Hult?
he wants to know if you're going to Christian's. He's in love with you.
what she say? - That Elin's coming.
anything else? - Like... like she was interested.
she thinks you're good looking. - Jessica said that?
that Elin thinks so? You sure? - Yeah.
did Jessica say that Elin thinks I'm good looking?
What'd you say? - I said you thought nothing of him.
not as far as I know, anyway. - God this sucks!
want a ride? He'll be after me all night. I'm not going.
you wanted to fall in love. - Not Johan Hult!
I think Johan is sweet. - He's at high school and has a moped!
Yes, but maybe he'd be good for you. - Hardly.
can't we go somewhere else? - Where?
I don't know. I'd even rather go to Agnes.
Agnes?! - Yeah, from 9A. She's having a party.
are you braindead, or what?
what if a great guy is there? - At Agnes'?
Yes, maybe she knows someone really nice. - Sure.
people from somewhere else. - From where?
don't be so negative! Bengtsfors, Mellerud...
please...
okay, okay... - Thanks!
I'm hungry. - We'll wait a little while.
I've waited. When are they coming? - Have a little patience.
mum, no one's coming.
here they are.
Hi. Welcome. - Thanks.
I'll fetch Olof to help you up.
can we have food now? - Just wait a while.
perhaps Robyn's silly, but I think it smells really good.
let me see. Wow...
she has her own perfume. Have you seen it, Oskar?
can we have food now? - Maybe that's a good idea.
what do you say, dear? - I can't accept this.
sorry, but I can't accept this. - What can't you accept?
if this is the best you can do, don't bother.
Agnes. - Go home and take your perfume.
we're just pretend friends because there's no one else to be with.
not so? You know the most boring thing I've done?
going to wheelchair basketball in Karlstad with you.
I don't want to be friends with a palsied cripple.
who listens to Back Street Boys, Arvingarna, or whatever shit you listen to.
blame yourself! I didn't want a party, it was your idea.
cut it out. I don't want to hear one more word.
you can stay here and enjoy the wonderful roast beef!
have fun!
I'd like to go home.
no one will ever like me!
why should I live? I don't want to live, I want to die!
no, I want to die!
I'm sorry... This whole party business...
what were you thinking? That all my friends would come?
I have no friends, haven't you understood, not one!
mum hasn't understood anything, anyway.
Hey, there there...
because she can't understand these things...
she's always been so perfect, always had everything...
sweetheart. - I know exactly how she was.
she was... she was like one of those...
now she thinks it awful her daughter's become so strange.
and ugly, a failure, repulsive!
but darling. You're not a failure, repulsive or strange at all...
you're wonderful. - No, I'm not.
Agnes, you're a wonderful person. - No, I'm not.
Yes, you're wonderful...
wonderful, Agnes. Do you hear me?
I can't see why I agreed. - Don't be so negative. It might be fun.
sure. Watch out! - What are you doing?
A-drain. - Shit!
Thanks. Let's have some fun.
don't you like it? - Yes, it's good, I'm just not hungry.
but you like it?
shall we rent a video? Or is it too late?
it seems totally dead. Shall we just forget it?
I don't want to. - You can't just sit here.
they can go. The party's cancelled.
wait... - Go and tidy up and I'll tell them...
...to come in and wait here.
what's all this? - Here, have some.
what party is this? Are we the only ones?
why complain? We got wine and everything.
Yes, but like... Okay, we'll drink the wine and go.
okay. Cheers. - Cheers.
wasn't anyone there? - Yes, but they weren't hungry.
so they went up to your room. - My room?
I have them a little wine.
who was it? - Jessica and Elin.
no one I know. - Jessica and Elin?
did you lock it? - Hello!
I'm just...
why'd you lock it? - I'm avoiding her. We'll just drink up and leave.
I'm just... I'm just changing pants.
you've got a skirt on! - I just want to get drunk!
they're changing. - You can go to the lounge.
we're coming soon.
have you heard she's a lesbian? - What! Really?
Agnes? Is it true that you're...
aren't you ready?
I think it's cool. - Cool?
I'm also going to be one. - Come on!
I'm going to. - Open up now!
open it. She's nice. - If she's so nice, go out and neck her.
okay. What do i get if I do? - If you do what?
if I neck her? - You'll get AIDS, probably.
if I kiss her, will you give me 100? - You wouldn't.
100. - But I haven't got 100.
I'll give you 20.
okay. - But you won't dare.
you'll have to leave.
Hi.
you... - Yes.
can't you sit over here. - Why, what for?
there's something I want to tell you.
can't you just say it? - But... I don't want Jessica to hear.
but... why?
please? I really don't want her to hear.
it's just that...
you're so pretty.
Jesus, Elin, you're insane! That's disgusting!
here's 20.
have they left? Have they already left?
no, but we were going to a party and I didn't want to go.
I don't want to, I'm tired. I don't feel like it.
fucking hell! Why'd I do that?
it was just a joke. - No, I'm going back. I must say sorry.
fuck that! We're going to have fun, I'm drunk.
then they kissed each other. - No! Is it true?
you kissed her for 20 crowns? - Was it worth it?
Hi, babe. How are you? - Good.
how was it? - Wicked!
you kidding! Was it nice? - It was horrible, what do you think?
everyone knows you're not like that, anyway.
what if her dad answers and comes to the school?
he could... - Or her mother.
Ahlberg. - Hi, is that Agnes?
I want you to know you make me so hot.
can't I come round so we can lick each other or something?
she's checking you out. - No.
are you an arsehole, or what?
are you in love with her? - No! Or, yeah...
are you braindead? - You're in love with her.
come on!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
don't you feel well? - Leave!
wait, I'll give you something to drink.
here.
Thanks.
Jesus, you're beautiful.
you're the most beautiful of all. - You're drunk.
it's true. - You're drunk.
it's true. I like you. - Get... out the way! Out the way!
take it easy! - Out the way!
Hey, I didn't mean to. Hey... please. Don't go.
look, mine's much smaller. - Markus...
smaller maybe, but mine's thinner. - It's smaller and thinner.
Markus, can't we go?
Agnes.
come in.
hi...
I've made some tea.
how are you? - I'm reading.
you're not upset? - No.
what are you reading?
Ah, Edith，Bergran...
the day sighs into the night.
how does it go? "Take my hand,
take my arm. Take my th..." "Thin shoulder's longing" - Dad...
night.
Agnes!
Agnes.
Hi.
I didn't mean to do that.
it was really silly.
had you gone to bed?
could I use your toilet? I'm gonna pee myself.
alright.
Thanks.
no, don't turn it off. It was really nice.
I'm so tired of it. - Can't you put on something else?
wow, this is really good.
can I use some? - Sure.
what do you want to hear? I don't know...
is it true you're a lesbian? If you are,
I understand, because guys are gross.
I'm also going to be one, I think.
but...
maybe I should go home.
shit, let's go to the party. I have to anyway because my jacket's there.
we'll go and hit someone. - No, I'm not invited.
so? We'll burn the house down.
come on. Please...
you want to? - Yeah.
what you gonna be when you grow up? - I don't know.
I'm going to be a model. Or I'm gonna be a psychologist.
I've also thought of that. - Really? You're also gonna be that?
dunno, it seems exciting digging in people's minds and...
but really, you'll probably find it silly, I'd most like to be a writer.
you can be that too. You could books about those...
...those, like, all that psychic stuff and mass murderers.
but I'd rather be a model. You think I can be?
Yes. But I think it's more fun being a psychologist.
am I pretty enough? - Yes, you are.
I don't think I want to go to that party.
why are you so weird? I don't mean anything but...
you are weird. - You're also weird.
am I? - Yes.
I want to be weird. Well, not weird but...
I don't want to be like everyone else. Though, sometimes I'm just the same. - But you're not. - You know what my nightmare is?
I'll get kids, a car, a house... All of that.
then my husband leaves with someone younger,
and I'm stuck with kids that just scream and nag.
it's so fucking meaningless.
Where're you from? I mean, where'd you live before here?
Mariefred.
was it fun there? - Okay...
can I ask you something? - What?
have you been with lots of girls? - Why're you asking that?
I was just wondering.
no, I haven't been with lots of girls if you must know.
when you kissed me... - I could die, sorry!
it was the first time. - Was it?
first and last time. - But that's completely wrong!
it's so unfair. If you lived in Stockholm, for example, then...
then you'd have loads of girls. - You think so?
yes...
Where're you going? - Come.
we're going to Stockholm.
you're not sane! - 'Course I am, 'course I'm sane.
okay, but you're on the wrong side. - What?
Stockholm's that way. - I see...
come on! - Are you serious?
we say 10 cars from now. If any stop, we're going to Stockholm.
otherwise, forget it. - Five.
okay, five. If any of them stop, it's like God's telling us.
idiot!
watch out!
when I get a car, I'll always stop for hitchhikers.
shit!
we'll do it. Let's do it! - Should we?
come on!
Hi. We're going to Stockholm. We live there.
we've been visiting our aunt and got money for the train.
and bought records with the money and can't get home.
you can come with me to Karlstad. - Thanks very much!
No!
it does this sometimes. I'll just...
what the hell are we doing? We're fucking crazy!
I know. - But we're so fucking cool.
what on earth are you up to?
is this "Candid Camera"?
out of the car!
it's freezing. I should go home.
mum's coming home soon and...
but I can call you tomorrow.
do you want to?
you sure? - Yeah...
Oops, I thought it was Mum. - What're you doing?
have to eat the crips or she'll know we've been out.
can't we not have eaten them? - That would seem odd, she'll wonder.
Elin...
Where've you been? - Nowhere special.
some guy? - No... yeah.
who? - No one.
tell me! - Stop it.
but, tell me!
Leonardo DiCaprio is skinny. - No...
he's got arms like this!
what about your mascara?
what do you mean "maskara"? It's how I do my make-up.
stop being nasty. God, you're silly!
Elin.
Elin.
Elin.
what were you dreaming about?
a nightmare. - Didn't exactly sound like a nightmare.
did I say anything?
did I say anything?
Nah. You said...
you were moaning and going on. Didn't sound like a nightmare.
but it was. Someone was going to kill me.
didn't sound like that. - But they were.
I was dreaming, wasn't I? So I should know.
I know you're not a victim of palsy. I don't know why I said that.
and that perfume actually smells really good.
and the wheelchair match. - Basketball.
isn't the most boring I've done. - Why'd you say it then?
I don't know. - You don't know?
you know what? It doesn't make any difference anymore.
because I've never liked you. And I never will, either.
it'll be so nice to be rid of you.
I won't need to worry you'll paw someone and be nauseating.
the whole school will found out what you are. And they...
good luck with Elin.
Ahlberg.
am I disturbing you? - No.
were you calling him? - Who?
him from yesterday you won't say. - No.
there was no one at home.
come out for a smoke.
Hello?
tell me. - I can't, it's impossible.
but, do I know him?
if I told you you'd be totally... - Are you going to meet again?
no. I said I'd call, but I won't.
of course you will. You're in love. I can see it.
I'm not at all!
why can't you just tell me who it is?
you don't understand. You'd hate me, you'd never speak to me again.
you fucking cunt!
what the hell are you doing! - I knew you were after Markus!
it's not him! - Who is it, then?!
no one! - Tell me! Tell me!
tell me who it is! - Take it easy!
take it easy.
it's Johan.
Johan Hult? - Yes.
are you in love with Johan Hult? - Hysterical!
you said he was... - Can't you change your mind?
sorry... I really thought it was Markus!
go to hell! Be a fucking cunt yourself!
sorry!
we'll have number one up here. Here we go!
Sweets!
mum... I'm a lesbian.
what? - Homosexual.
I'm just kidding.
we have 1, 000 crowns on the line. Look at the first page.
aren't you going out? - No.
are you fighting again?
why do you always fight? - Because we don't like each other.
because we're different. She's the biggest drip and I'm the coolest in the world.
you sure we have the same dad? - Of course you have!
let's not talk about him.
haven't you got a lottery ticket? - What? No...
why are we watching it then? I thought we'd win a car.
why are we looking at it? - Well, it's...
lots of reasons. The music and... other things too.
it's fun to watch when someone wins. See how much they win.
totally meaningless...
hello. - Hi.
what are you doing? Can't you come here?
I don't know. - Sorry I said what I did.
sorry I called you that and stuff.
I didn't mean to. I really thought it was Markus.
can't you come here? - I don't know.
please... Yeah...
Johan's here. Please...
okay, I'll come. - Good. See you later.
shall I talk to Johan? - No!
don't be shy now.
Yeah, I pump iron every day. - How much?
98 kg.
can I talk to you?
Elin's sitting over there... I think she wants to talk to you.
with me? - Yes. Just stroll over and talk to her.
should I talk to her? - Yes, talk to her.
Hi. - Hi.
Jessica said you wanted to talk to me.
have you got anything to drink?
Yes. - Have you?
here.
Markus... no... Markus, control yourself...
Markus, we were just talking. - Oh, yeah?
stop it... Markus...
Elin. - It's Agnes...
Hi. - Hi.
Hi. - Hello.
sweetheart, how are you?
has something in particular happened?
shall we talk about it?
I recognize so much of myself in you. When I was at your age...
...I had no friends, no girls were interested in me.
but then... then all of that changes.
and it becomes the other way around.
like when I was at the 25 year class reunion last spring.
I noticed that it was me... Well, things had gone quite well for me.
I'd done quite well. But that guy Bengt,
who was the king of the class then, he'd became nothing.
and those girls who were regarded as the prettiest in the class...
...they weren't noteworthy at all anymore.
you should be glad you're not someone who has it easy.
who has no problems, because those people are often uninteresting.
but dad you're talking, like, in 25 years.
sorry, but I'd rather be happy now than in 25 years.
sure, you're right. Perhaps it's not much of a comfort at the moment.
but, anyway... - Because in 25 years...
that's, like, 25 years... it doesn't exist.
are you two in the same programme? - I'm in Electrics and he's in Vehicles.
did you have to do that? - He was groping you.
he was doing nothing like that. - He wasn't doing that?
what programme are you going to do? - I haven't decided.
what's Jessica going to do? - Child and Leisure.
she's also applied for Hairdressing, but I don't think she'll get in.
don't be where I am then! - Can't you see it's embarrassing?
you're a mental case. - Thanks, maybe I am.
I'm with you. You become what you're with.
I'm going to be a psychologist... I think so, anyway.
psychologist? - But which programme do I follow?
are you going to be a psychologist? - Yes.
you never said so. - I don't have to tell you everything.
why do you want to be that? - Because I want to.
not a chance. You know what grades you need?
what the hell do you know? Are you a psychologist?
I just know. Isn't it so, Johan?
yeah... I don't know. It's probably like that.
you probably need good grades. - You don't have a chance.
no? I'll be a mechanic instead, you need really good grades for that!
something that would suit you. You need a double A+.
you're a pain. - What you mean, "pain"?
Hi. Is it free here?
what did she want? - I don't know.
what did she want?
you were going to call. You forget? - What're you talking about?
why'd she hit...? - What the hell you doing? Are you mad?
fucking dyke!
Agnes slapped Elin. - Why?
she's in love with you. - What?! How'd you...?
she has been for a long time. She's written about you. It's true!
monday: Why am I so stupid? Why do I love Elin?
I love her and I hate her [at the same time]. I love her so my heart nearly breaks.
but no one's ever hurt me like her.
did it hurt?
Yeah, a little.
but it was nice too. - Was it?
Yeah, it was really nice.
I'm so damn happy. I can't believe it's true.
let's show some energy, this isn't a fucking old people's home.
I want passes on the blade, I want sweat...
this isn't a youth hostel for mummy's boys. Let's get tough!
how was it? Did it hurt? - Not especially.
I said it did so he'd feel sorry for me.
he stopped just when it was getting good.
he was at it for about five seconds. - It's the same with Markus.
although he's getting better now. In the beginning it was just...
and it was over.
Jessica, Jessica! - Markus!
are you happy? - Sure I am.
I think he's really nice. If I wasn't with Markus then...
I mean... - Oops...
I just think he's nice. He's not like Markus who's always trying to be tough.
Why're you together with him, then? - I don't know. It's...
it's just like that. It's him and me. It's just like that.
look how cute he was as a kid.
Johan thought I'd slept with loads of guys.
when I told him I was a virgin he was shocked.
why'd he think that? - Markus had said that.
markus told him? - Yeah...
he's such a moron. He always goes around bullshitting!
I'll talk to him. - Doesn't matter.
what is it? - Nothing.
are you upset? - No.
you're so exasperating! You change your mind the whole time!
first, you don't even like Johan.
then you're suddenly in love with him. - God you go on...
no, but you're never satisfied. You always get what you want.
get what I want? What the hell do you know about that!
what you reckon? Is she pretty or what?
alright. Not bad...
nice breasts. - And her pussy?
what do you think of her pussy?
she's totally deranged.
she put her hand on my thigh and felt me up.
yeah? And? - Nice picture you put up.
she's a bloody headcase. - Yeah...
mum, what does lesbian mean?
what? Why are you asking?
Kalle said that someone is one.
who? - It's someone who...
well, it means that if you are a girl... or rather, a woman...
if you're a woman you like other woman.
instead of like... mum, I like dad...
but if you are a lesbian or...
...It's also called homosexual, then maybe two woman like each other.
instead of like with mum and dad where it's a man and a woman.
do you have to go to hospital? - Hospital?
no, not at all. There's nothing wrong at all, you're just...
you're like everyone else.
who is it that...? - Kalle says...
...that his brother says that...
...Agnes is a lesbian.
Agnes?
that's the most ridiculous... She's not at all.
Why'm I so stupid? Why do I love Elin?
is it true? - Yes.
you've, like, read...
you've, like, you've gone into my room...
...and been at my computer... - I'm sorry.
it's unforgiveable, I know. I regret it deeply.
but I'd still like us to talk about what I read.
stop! I don't want to hear more. I don't want to talk to you. You can leave.
please Agnes. - Leave!
Agnes... - Out! Leave!
I didn't do it out of spite.
I did it because I was worried about you.
Ivar 29... two nine... We're talking horizontal lines...
niklas 35... three five...
it's the wrong number all the time.
Oscar 64... six four...
fucking hell! - Quiet.
can't we do something else? - Quiet.
you bloody idiot! - Shit, Elin!
moron!
Gustav 53... five three...
so, you punch in the number...
then you send it. You press here. - Where've you been?
Where've you been..." I can do what I like, or maybe I can't?
sure, I was just wondering. - Markus is showing us his mobile.
really interesting... - Girls don't understand stuff like this.
what don't we understand? - Like... mobiles.
why don't understand mobile phones? - Stuff like technology...
...sport, cars... porno films...
Ouch. Sorry. - You're an idiot.
what? It's not so strange. You're great at things we don't understand.
like what, for instance?
make-up. - You think that's all we do!
I don't know. - What else?
what else are we interested in? - Stuff like looks, clothes...
stuff like make-up and looking good.
you're such a fucking idiot!
and you? Why're you sitting without saying anything? What do you think?
I don't know. - Do you think the same as him?
or why are you sitting there quietly? - What do you mean?
do you think the same as Markus?
of course. I mean, we stick together, don't we?
don't tell him what he should think. - What's up with you now?
can't you talk? What do you think? - I don't know.
you're an idiot as well.
Jesus, I'm sick of you. - What the hell have I done now?!
Hello, it's Markus. - Can I talk to Johan?
it's for you. - Hello, this is Johan.
I don't want to be with you anymore. It's over. You can go home.
I hate my life. - You're such a fool.
why'd you break up with Johan? - I'll never be with anyone.
he's far too good for you. - I'm going to be celibate.
don't stand there. A-drain. - Grow up.
acne, abortion alcoholism, anorexia...
you still at nursery school? - Anal sex, asthma, AIDS...
Hello, you're standing on one too. - This is a C-drain.
you just think it means cupid. Know what it means?
it means crap. - Move off it.
and condyloma and cancer. - You irritate me.
must you always do the opposite? - We'll test it. Do this.
abortion... acne... anal sex...
no, I don't feel anything. No anal sex...
you're not normal. You're not fucking normal!
hi... It's Elin.
Hi. - I just wanted to say...
I think you're really nice and things, but...
it's just that I'm... I'm in love with someone else...
who is it?
Where're you going?
stop it! What are you doing! - I must talk to you.
I must talk to you... It's really important.
please, please. I'm just going to say one thing. Please!
what do you want to say?
I was the one that threw the stone.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to break it. I wanted...
I wanted to talk to you. I didn't mean to...
because you probably think...
...I think you are a bad person, but it's not like that.
it's completely the opposite.
actually I think that you're... you're good.
are you winding me up? - No, I'm serious.
I have... I have been thinking and things...
...a lot... about you.
have you?
if you're fooling me again I'll kill you. - I'm not.
I'm not, I'm not fooling you.
and, yes...
is it true that you...? Victoria said that you were...
...in love with me. Because...
...if you are, then I am too.
in you, that is...
are you?
hurry up!
I'll just...
it's broken. - What?
there's something wrong with the flushing.
use another. - Are you on your period?
is that the only joke you know?
use another one, I said. - Okay, I've got it.
Jessica!
What're you doing?
what? - Elin's with a guy in the toilet.
what the hell are you talking about?! - But that's why, isn't it?
not at all! - Come on, Jessica. Elin!
bloody morons! What the hell are we going to do?
Elin. Let us in so we can see who it is!
open up! We want to know! - Elin, come out.
Elin's with a guy in the toilet. - Who is it?
no one knows. I think it's Johan.
no, it's over. - Over? Come on we can't wait.
what's going on? - It's Elin with a guy.
Hey! - Come on, stop it.
maybe if we said that we were just going to...
no, I don't know...
is it Tomas? - Tomas!
is that the best you can do?
we can't sit here all day this is totally weird.
what should we do? - We walk out, of course.
Elin...
Where's Elin, I have to talk to her. - In the toilet with a guy.
for real? - We thought it was you.
Johan. Johan, wait.
Johan... forget about her.
she's just a fool and you're far too good for her.
hey...
don't be sad, things will work out...
cut this out. What's going on? - Nothing.
of course there is. - Elin, come on!
come on.
let's go out.
but...
did you really mean what you said before?
yes...
hey...
okay. Shall I open it?
make a move! - Elin, come on. Come out.
here I am. This is my new girlfriend.
please move. We're gonna go fuck now.
is it okay? It's not too strong?
I usually make it too strong. I usually...
Jessica gets mad! I use two grams of milk and 5, 000 kg of chocolate.
and it's always nearly black and then...
then I usually pour in more milk, but then the glass isn't big enough.
then I have to pour it into a bigger glass
or another glass if there isn't a big one.
it makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter.

my daughter.
l'm looking for my daughter. l'm afraid that she's been hurt.
we've all lost our children.
our light.
they deceived me.
their evil.
their hate.
they hurt my child.
they did terrible things to her.
Alessa.
this is my daughter, Sharon.
she sleepwalks, so you have to be careful...
...but if you see her, please, tell her to wait for me.
Yes, she's mine.
lt was mine. - lt's mine.
lt's mine. - lt's mine!
lt's mine! - Get off me!
lnto the fire she swallowed their hate.
hi there. - Yeah.
listen, my wife, she came through here last night.
maybe you saw her? - Daughter worked night shift.
actually, she was heading for this place, Silent Hill.
how do l get there? - You don't.
town's closed down because of the coal fire still burning underground, you know?
breathe enough of them fumes, oh, bound to kill you.
okay...
...where's the turnoff?
Sharon?
come on.
Hi, this is Chris. Please leave a message.
Christopher, it's me.
l'm in Silent Hill. l'm sorry, l made a mistake.
Sharon's lost, but l think l know where she is...
...so l'm going to the school to look for her.
l'm not okay, all right? l need your help.
please, please, hurry.
fuck. Come on!
ma'am, l want you to put both hands on the wheel.
put both hands on the wheel.
Where's the little girl, ma'am?
please, my daughter, she's gone. l need your help.
get out of the car. - What?
move it.
Jesus, what are you doing?
you're under arrest. - What?
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
l don't think you understand. There's something weird going on.
my daughter, she's in danger.
lf you really cared, you wouldn't have sped off.
listen to me, she's ill. She sleepwalks.
just calm right down. l'm gonna find the little girl.
officer Bennett to base, over.
base, do you copy, over?
shit. - You're bleeding.
cracked my head on the road pretty good, when my bike went down. l must have been out for a while.
you are all right to walk? - Sure.
then it looks like we'll be hiking back to Brahams.
what?
you're going back to the station.
are you kidding? - Nope.
have you heard a single word l've said?
Yeah, l hear you. - Have you heard a single word l've said?
l'm sure she's at the school, we just need to turn around...
...Silent Hill... ...sorry...
...Sharon... ...lost...
...I think I know where...going to the school to look for her...
I'm not okay...
I need your...your help. Please, hurry!
sorry, sir, this road is closed. You'll have to turn around.
l'm looking for my wife. She may have come through here.
she drives a Jeep Liberty. Silver, Ohio plates.
sir, this man's wife was driving the Jeep.
bring him down.
come on. - You've seen her?
where is she?
lnspector Thomas Gucci. Enjoying the weather, are you?
for God's sake, l'm trying to find my wife.
l know. Hang on a second.
now, that vehicle you were talking about, we found it.
lt's at the end of the bridge here, but it's empty.
we've got no indication anyone's come under any harm.
good Christ. - Now, you mind telling me what your wife's doing up here, Mr...?
da Silva, Chris Da Silva. - My pleasure, Chris...
the faster we start looking, the faster we're gonna find her.
all right, hold your horses, hold your horses, Chris.
l've also got a missing deputy.
and knowing Officer Cybil Bennett the way l do, she's probably out there looking for your wife and daughter.
Bobby, make sure no one comes through that barricade.
we're gonna get our asses up to Silent Hill.
let's take a look around. - Yes, sir.
while Chris here tells me what's going on.
she disappeared yesterday. l spoke to her when she stopped for gas in Brahams.
why were you coming up here in the middle of the night?
l thought it would help her.
- You people. You get off the highway from whatever big city, bringing all your sick problems with you.
why aren't you listening to me?
we had a guy come up here two years ago, snatched a little boy from a rest stop, dropped him into a mine vent.
l never wanna see anything like that again.
look, l don't know what you're thinking, but you're not helping.
there is no way l would ever harm my own daughter.
how do l even know she is your daughter?
come on.
what the hell?
okay.
now do you see what l'm talking about?
will you take these handcuffs off me?
no. Get walking.
there's a fire-lookout tower on the far side of Toluca Lake.
lt should have a radio. - Fuck you, you stupid cop.
this place is completely cut off.
you have no idea what's going on. - Hey!
Hey, you up there!
l'm a police officer!
what's going on?
what is that?
stand back.
Jesus Christ, shoot it.
stay where you are!
stop!

Mrs. Da Silva, I am an officer of the law...
...and I will take you to safety.
why don't you let me do that? - Ninety percent of the time...
...when a wife takes a run...
...she takes the daughter to a place like this...
...l'd say she's damn mad at her husband.
you like hauling skeletons out of your family closet?
no, not all the time, but we're driving on top of them right now.
coal fire's still burning underneath.
you see the barbershop over there?
used to be my father's. - Your father?
he's dead.
november 74, when the fire caught.
they tried to evacuate this place as quick as they could...
...but it was hellish, people were dying and disappearing.
hell, they couldn't even find half the bodies.
that was the end of Silent Hill.
these were good people, most of them.
some, you might say deserved it.

sorry, sir, I can't access that information.
listen, goddamn it. - Sir.

they used to say this place was haunted.
l think they were right.
grand HOTEL
help! No!
stay away. - Come on.
stay away, sinner.

lt's here.
faith is our destroyer. Faith has brought us doom.
get back! - Hey, hey!
get back! - Hey, stop.
think you of thee who cast the first stone.
lambs without a shepherd, shepherd without a flock.
lt's your sins which hold you here.
stop your lies! - Calm down.
calm down, it's okay.
we're not gonna hurt you. - She's gone.
what's your name?
Anna. My name is Anna.
what's going on here, Anna? Who was that?
l've seen her before. - Dahlia was cast out.
not even the darkness wants her.
she's lost her daughter too. - What?
sinners deserve to lose their spawn. - What are you doing here, Anna?
mother needs more food.
you mean there are other people here?
Christabella keeps us safe.
Anna. - We take refuge in the church.
Anna, listen to me.
l've lost my daughter. She's all alone.
can you imagine how frightened she must feel?
tell me, have you seen her?
do you know where she is?
lf she has faith, she might survive.
if not...
l'm taking this.
have you seen this?
l've seen it at the school.
lt's on all the buildings the elders of my elders built.
lt's a symbol of our unity, a symbol of our faith.
rose, look at this.
what is it? - Just like yours.
where did you find it? - They're all over the floor.
rose.
check this out.
what number did you take this from? - 111.

Yes, I have that information for you. - Yeah.
can you give me that address?
we are wandering far from refuge here.
let's keep her with us. She's all we got.
there's no room 111.
the first burning.
what is it, Anna? - The first burning.
before the town had a name.
the elders of my elders kept us pure.
the founders of this town were witch- hunters.
burning the witch held back the darkness.
lt stopped the apocalypse.
lt's here.
there's a room in here.
look at this.
here.
damn.
what is this place?
l don't know. We're in the next building.
some factory, maybe?
looks like there was a fire.
Rose!
who are you?
lt's okay.
don't be scared. l promise l'm not gonna hurt you.
rose?
okay. Come on.
come on.
lt's okay. Hey.
lt's okay.
lt's okay.
l'm not gonna hurt you.
Oh, my God.

Where's my Sharon?

l'm burning.
rose?
rose? My God.
how did you get over there? - Where is she?
grab onto it.
now swing back around. - Okay.
are you all right? - Yeah.
what the hell were you doing over there?
you're gonna get yourself killed.
l think l just saw Dahlia's daughter.
she was the one that brought us here.
what are you talking about?
she was the one that made me crash my car.
Alessa.
we don't say her name.
that's the seal, isn't it, Anna?
the symbol of your faith?
something terrible happened here.
we have to leave. We have to leave!
the darkness is coming! - Let's go.
let's go!
the church isn't far.
run. Run! - Rose, come on!
Rose!
Hurry!
rose.
come! - We gotta go.
rose, come on. - l've seen this.
rose, let's go!
Cybil! - Rose, come on.
Cybil!
you run not towards sanctuary but from your fears.
do not join the others. They are deceivers. They are damned.
we gotta get inside. - No!
they are wolves in the skin of sheep.
they brought about their own hell. They'll take you with them.
filth and lies! - Hey!
stop it!
please. l've seen your daughter. l've seen Alessa.
lt's coming! - She's dead, isn't she?
fire doesn't cleanse, it blackens.
listen to me. - Rose, hurry!
she looks exactly like Sharon.
she brought us here, didn't she?
Why? What does she want?
evil wakes in vengeance.
be careful what you choose.
Rose!
Oh, God, no.
witches! - She's evil.
keep away the witches!
no. - Send them back!
no.
we're lost.
this is a sanctuary.
please, Christabella, they lured my Anna.
they gave her to the fiend.
Eleanor, you must remember that Anna went against our laws.
she went alone outside into the devil's playground.
she was not the responsibility of these two strangers.
we'll deal with them later.
now we must pray.
revelation 20: 11-15
and then l saw them...
...from whose presence earth and heaven fled away.
and no home was left to them.
and then l saw them...
...from whose presence earth and heaven fled away.
and no home was left to them.
and l saw the dead, the great and the small...
...and they were judged according to their deeds.
and l saw the dead, the great and the small...
...and they were judged according to their deeds.
and anyone's name not found written in the book of life...
...they will be thrown into the lake of fire.
Toluca County Orphanage
and now l lay me down to sleep...
...l pray the Lord my soul to keep.
lf l should die before l wake...
...l pray the Lord my soul to take.
Amen.
all right, girls, into bed. Quickly, now.
no better place to be on a rainy night.
ln you go, Lindsey, that's a girl. You've got your bear, that's a girl.
no. No talking after lights are out.
good night, children.
and God bless.
l'm sorry, Sister Margaret, this really can't wait.
l can't imagine why.
nine years ago...
...a baby was left outside this orphanage.
my wife and l were the ones who adopted her.
l'm very happy for you, Mr. Da Silva...
...but l can't give out information on our children.
look.
that girl, she looks exactly like my daughter.
l can't help you, l'm sorry.
lt's late. - She must be 40 now.
where can l find her?
this story isn't hers alone but all of ours!
- You people.
you got yourself something.
you know what you got now, Chris? How about breaking and entering?
by the looks of this, a little assault as well.
thank you, Thomas.
this can't go any farther. - lt won't, Sister.
you know, I have some 12-year-olds who cover their tracks better than you do.
what's this?
look, Gucci, do you know her?
ls that my daughter's birth mother?
look, turn around. - What are you doing?
l knew that girl. l did.
l was told she didn't make it through the night.
the night of the fire.
the night of the big fire in Silent Hill.
there were these people...
...these fanatics.
what they did to that child was terrible.
that was 30 years ago, and it's over now.
not as far as l'm concerned.
what's it gonna be, city boy?
l can put you in jail or you can go home.
and that's your definition of justice?
many different forms of justice, Chris.
see, you've got man's, God's, and even the devil's.
certain forms you just can't control.
so l want you to go home now to your nice warm bed...
...and let me deal with this town and what has happened over the last 30 years.
okay? End of story.
Domine DEUS OMNIPOTENS IN CUIUS MANU
tell me first how you got here.
honestly, l don't know how l got here.
right now, l've lost my little girl...
...and all l know is that l'm supposed to be in this church.
are you a person of faith?
l love my daughter. - That's not what l asked.
who are you to judge?
we judge because the souls of history hang in the balance.
because our faith has never failed us.
our faith keeps the darkness of hell at bay.
then use your faith to help me find my little girl.
only the demon knows where she is.
then tell me, where do l find this demon?
no one has ever returned from the core of the darkness where the demon lies in wait.
she's not gonna help us. Let's go.
lf you wish to face the demon to find your daughter, l won't stop you.
Christabella, they can't go down... - Silence, Adam.
perhaps your faith will protect you.
perhaps not.
lf you don't wanna do this, l'll understand.
Sharon's adopted...
...but l'm her mother.
l knew that from the moment l first laid eyes on her.
she's lucky to have you.
mother is God in the eyes of a child.
quiet.
we're in his domain now.
look at this map. Memorize it.
your memory may save your life.
do you see this room? - Yeah.
that is where the darkness lies.
the demon is in the bowels of this building.
lt hides behind the face of an innocent.
you mean a child?
don't believe your eyes. Your eyes will lie to you.
faith is the only truth.
l will pray for you, Rose...
...but l won't expect you and your friend to return.
goodbye.
Adam.
left. Right.
left. Left.
right. Right. Left. - Take them to the lower level.
ln the basement? - Do it, then return.
left. 3A. - But...
right. 4A. - l said, do it.
left. Left. Right. - Rose. Rose.
left. Right. Left. Left. - Rose, she's killing you.
Rose! - Let me do this.
l need to do this.
take this.
they'll be drawn to the light, but you won't be able to see without it.
thank you.
so this thing actually works? - lt will.
lf the demon wants you, it will.
forgive me.
we've lived too long as scavengers. l believe this is yours.
witch! Her child's the likeness of Alessa.
her child's the next vessel.
stop her! Don't let the witches go down!
come on!
get off her!
find her.
No! Wait! Cybil!
Cybil! Open the door!
No!
7 A. Right.
right. 6A.
left, left. Right, right.
left, left.
okay. l can do this.
congratulations, Rose.
you're here.
you did it.
your reward is the truth.
did you see that Alessa was a good little girl?
even though nobody looked at her that way.
burn the witch! Burn the witch! - Their parents told them she was bad.
she didn't have a father like they did.
Alessa was alone in the world.
you know what can happen to little girls when they're left alone.
Colin lt's okay, it's me, come on.
even her mother couldn't help.
even though she loved her baby.
but the rest of the family didn't love Alessa.
they were just like the others and made her scared.
we know. Even the children know it.
your daughter...
why you won't just name the father...
you've brought sin amongst us.
the faithful must gather in judgment for we are called to purify this filth.
what does she mean, Mommy?
you're weak, my dear sister. You always were.
trust us, Dahlia. Have faith in our virtue.
we will restore innocence.
they had met many times since the town was built to restore innocence and purity.
they had a special place for that.
do you remember the hotel?
I led you to all these places...
...and you were very good at following my clues.
you may leave, Dahlia.
we fight the sin, not the sinner.
mommy! Mommy!
mommy!
you know how that feels, don't you, Rose?
to lose your little girl?
what have l done?
Oh, God. - Weep not for the demon.
No!
once again we are locked in mortal battle.
they thought they knew how to cast out evil.
praise God for our clarity. - Amen.
praise the innocent for their sacrifice.
but you should be careful how you fight evil.
they give us back our purity. - Purity.
and our unity. - Unity.
your weapons can turn back on you.
no.
no.
now you know why Dahlia is broken.
she tried to get help...
...but she went too late.
get her up, boys. Get her up now!
there were good people in the town...
...people like you, Rose.
people who like to help.
Alessa was so lonely and hurt and scared.
they should have known better than to hurt her so badly.
when you're hurt and scared for so long...
...your fear and pain turn to hate...
...and the hate starts to change the world.
Alessa's hate grew and grew, burning inside her.
her hate got so strong...
...she even hurt someone who was only curious.
that's when I came.
I told her it was their turn.
I promised they would all fall into her darkest dream.
now, Rose, we must talk.
don't be afraid.
she won't hurt you.
she needs your help.
who is she?
she is Alessa. - Then who are you?
l have many names.
right now, l'm the dark part of Alessa.
Where's my child?
she's not your child.
she's hers.
the little girl is what's left of her goodness.
we hid her in safety, in the world outside this hell.
Toluca County Orphanage
now the dream of this life must end...
...and so, too, must the dreamers within it.
for over 30 years...
...they've lied to their own souls.
for 30 years they've denied their own fate.
but now is the end of days...
...and l am the reaper.
what do you want?
all we ask for is satisfaction.
satisfaction?
revenge.
why me?
you chose.
you chose Sharon.
Christabella will find Sharon.
she plans to purify her.
Oh, God, no.
their blind conviction repels me from their church.
l cannot enter while they deny their fate...
...but you can.
just tell me what l need to do. - Tell them the truth.
the child is mine!
mine!
she's mine.
she's mine!
the truth is clear to those who see.
just as l could see you had this child.
let's go.
out of the car. Turn around.
just a friendly warning...
...l'll be back with people who know what they're doing.
before you do that, Chris, l wanna tell you about Officer Bennett.
few years back, some wacko, he abducted a kid, threw him down a mine vent up there in Silent Hill.
Cybil Bennett, she found that boy.
she spent three days holding onto him, keeping him alive until they were rescued.
we know what we're doing.
l need to do everything l can.
let's go.
please. Christabella, let her live.
your weakness led these souls to judgment.
this time you will bear witness. - She is innocent.
look at her. She's the whelp of your daughter.
the demon!
the demon fathered this disgusting abomination from her child!
no, she's mine!
Sharon. Sharon, look at me.
look at me. Don't be afraid.
lt's okay, it's okay. Your mama's coming.
once again we are called upon to restore innocence.
we burn this witch. We vanquish evil.
no. You can't. You can't.
don't let her say this! No! - We burn the child!
we fight the demon!
she's just a child!
what the fuck is wrong with you people?
let her go!
leave her alone!
leave her alone!
those who aid the demon...
...they must be cleansed by the fire from whence they came.
that's crazy. You're crazy.
No!
why are you listening to this?
Why?
burn the witch! Burn her!
burn the witch! Burn her! Burn the witch!
Sharon.
evil witch!
suffer.
burn the witch! Burn her!
burn the witch! Burn her!
Oh, my God.
burn the witch! Burn her! Burn the witch! Burn her!
burn the witch! Burn her! Burn the witch! Burn her!
burn her!
you're in your own hell.
mama, be with me.
here is where the apocalypse began.
this is where we stopped the annihilation of the world.
we drew a line in the sand and said:
"Demon, you will not cross! "
but the demon is wicked, full of treachery.
yet again he comes to tempt us in the guise of an innocent.
to rid the world of this demon, we must burn this child!
that's not gonna happen!
mommy!
lt's okay, baby. Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
what have you people done?
you have returned. - Yes, l have.
the witch has returned.
do not believe her lies.
l come from a world outside this place.
l come from a world full of life!
why don't you tell them the truth.
tell them the truth that you deny, even to yourself.
there was no apocalypse!
you burned in the fire that you started...
...and nothing can save you because you're already damned!
mommy! - Take her.
burn her. Burn her as a witch.
burn her! Burn her!
demon witch!
burn me? - Demon witch.
that's your answer.
burn anything you're afraid of.
burn anything you can't control.
this woman uses your fear to control you.
she led you to burn Alessa Gillespie.
she led you to burn an innocent child.
but you will not deny your guilt...
...and you cannot deny her pain!
that child was sin incarnate.
no, it's you who have sinned.
you darkened the heart of an innocent...
...and now you cower in the face of Alessa's revenge.
sinner. - Heresy.
burn her. Burn her!
your faith brings death!
you are alone in this limbo...
...and God is not here.
mommy!
she was a blasphemer.
blasphemer!
blasphemer!
what have you done?
you've brought the darkness in with you.
do you know what you've done?
for Sharon.
mommy.
mommy. Mommy.
mommy!
Oh, Lord, give me the strength to stay pure.
No! No!
Alessa, what have you become?
mommy!
Sharon! Sharon, honey, it's me. lt's Mommy.
down! We're getting down.
shut your eyes. Shut your eyes, baby.
shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.
shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.
lt's just a bad dream. lt's just a bad dream.
why did she not take me with the others?
because you're her mother.
mother is God in the eyes of a child.
l love you.
Hi, this is Chris. - And this is Rose.
and I'm Sharon Da Silva.
please leave a message!
Christopher, it's me.
l'm with Sharon.
Hello? Hello? Rose?
rose?
Yeah. We're coming home.
eh, Mr. Taransky, she's...
she's walking
don't tell me she's walking. She can't walk
Nicola
this, this, not this
Nicola, how was your massage?
you were in breach, cigarette - No no, it's about the new pages
because I've made the changes
all the changes you wanted, Nicola
you are...virtually in every scene
it is not the size of the role, Victor
am I or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
it's the biggest on earth
I swear Nicole it's a 50-foot Airstream Make no any longer
taller, Victor
taller, taller, eh?
you've insulted me for the last time
right, it's actually, it's actually taller
you're right, it was amazing - Coffee - Wait a minute, now, it's...
the tyres are overinflated, you see
it's just this
see, see, look, here The air can be pulled out
so sad
see, it's lower already
Nicola, I beg you, don't do this to me
no, I had three other offers
I only signed onto this picture out of...loyalty
well, then show me some, They're gonna shut me down
it's not working, Victor
my God, the scene with a thousand geese I don't understand this film
nobody is gonna understand this film
look, I already put out a press release Citing creative differences, ok?
so just let it go
you went to the press?
do we have everything, because I don't wanna come back here - Alright
you are right
you are right. And when you're right, you're right -Thank you -Let me help you with this -Jesus!
because you wanna go I don't deserve you
this film doesn't deserve you
it deserves much, much better than you
creative differences? The difference is, you're not creative
to hell, please
Jack
Jack, are you there?
she's good
you can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter
right here
right beside you
look
I've analyzed this footage
we've got everything we need in the can already
if I could just make a proper adjustment We can finish this film without her
Victor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue
if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame
they will sue, Victor, they're serious
so let's re-cast
Oh, Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part
it's a remake, Hal
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture
of course she is, Victor no other name's gonna sign on now
who needs a name?
we'll cast an unknown
I'm not gonna play opposite an unknown
we can't sell an unknown
if we ever wanna be in Nicola Anders business again
we have to cut off the losses and shut off the picture - No, I won't give in to that blackmailing... - Victor, let's take a walk
ridiculous performance
I told you she was bad
no, yours in there
why do you always set to make everything difficult for yourself?
difficult?
I'm being difficlut? - Yes
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike and Ikes?
they are not just Mike and Ikes. These are cherry Mike and Ikes
do you know why I, Victor, Taransky
two time anominated Academy Award director
Victor, that were short subject
overseeing the most cherished movie project in my whole career
I'm walking around with... look, look, look
pockets full of these... things
well, I have a feeling you're gonna tell me
I'm gonna tell you what
because this Nicola Anders supermodel with a SAG card has it written in the contract that all cherry Mike and Ikes be removed from her candy dish along with strict instruction that any room she walks into must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her
three of them opened
that there'll be a personal jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room
and anytime she travels
her nanny must fly with her first class
so, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children
don't you see, they're mocking us, Elaine we're at their mercy
what happened?
I, I mean we always had movie stars
but they used to be our stars, remember?
we were the one to tell them what to do
when we tell them what to wear, who to date.
that's what you want?
when they're under a contract to us
we can change their names, if we want to
Yeah, more than once
Victor, you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
I do remember why I got into this business
you seem to have forgotten
Oh please, come on
new York, Cassevettes, remember?
Oh, here we go
but when we were doing we were trying to do something important
I don't know shine a little light in that darkened cinema
it's called the projector, Victor
I illuminate hearts and minds
with a ray of truth
I thought that's what we are doing
Victor, I have good memories of those days too
I do, but this isn't about that
or you or me or some highminded ideal. This is business - Oh, spare me - Look around, who do you think pays for all of this?
this is about investment and return - I'm not interested in investment and return
I'm not interested who pays for anything
I'm trying to make a movie
I'm responsible for this, Victor
those days in New York
it's over, Victor
you're not renewing my contract.
how can I?
your last three pictures tanked
no bankable stars are gonna work with you after this
I mean it, if you just compromise a little
not every day you'll be fired by the mother of your own child
Victor, you and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake
and so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey
I fought for you
yeah
I'm sorry, Victor
dad
sweetheart - Hey Dad - Hi. How are you, honey? - Good
sorry Mama canned you
well, I'm gonna finish this picture
Lainey I'm gonna finish it
because, it's important
I know you about that
you are Victor Taransky
I'm Victor Taransky
OK
bye Dad - Hi, sweetheart - Hey Mom
you're ok, what's going on?
I'm Victor Taransky
Mr. Taransky
Mr. Taransky, thank God
I've been trying to see you
been calling
your, your assistant wouldn't put me through
I told her it was a matter of life and death
I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time
please, just
just keep this arranged
I do, I did it
I licked her skin
I licked her hair
I licked every part of her
I'm gonna call security, alright?
I'll call security if you don't back off
I, I haven't
Mr. Taransky
the answer to your prayers

I was misquoted.
I have your new leading lady right here in my pants

I'm not here
Mr. Taranky
Hank Aleno
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno
it was his last wish that you have this
what is it
I've no idea he wanted you to have it
welcome to Simulate One
Mr. Taransky Before we begin, a reminder
don't sit too close to the screen
nine months later
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
What're you running from?
from Valerie
Valerie, no
Jack, are you there?
something like this is gonna happen in the morning. What is it for?
why are we here?
is that what you're asking, Jack?
why are we here?
no why.
just here.
just here
for Hank
ladies and gentlemen of the jury
I know
I may be guilty of a crime but it was commited with the purest of intentions
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who put themselves above the work who put themselves above me
so what d'you guys think?
so fake
totally artificial
like we're really supposed to believe that was 19th Century Lisbon
come on
guys
who's looking at the set when she's on the screen, huh?
ah yeah
there he is. That's my Dad Viktor Taransky
she was magnificent - Absolutely unreal - Breathtaking
she, she was't too cartoony?
who? The nun?
or you're talking about the mother
it's startling who cares about the supporting cast.
congratulations again
she's not of this earth, you should be very proud
Oh, not of the earth
and the rest of the film, what do you think?
where did you find her
well, I saw her picture on the computer
computer?
you didn't notice anything unusual about it
only your brilliance
to be honest, while you are at the work I was expecting a train wreck
really pulled it off
I did
I thought that Mom's gonna take you back after this
back on the lot, is what I mean
I know come on , let's go
a dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere
to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world
in her debut film Sunrise, Sunset but who is Simone
we know so little about her and why this secrecy?
all we know for sure is that she was discoverd by little-known director Victor Tarinsky
Taransky
Simone
Simone
good to see you too, Elaine where is she she's not here
but why isn't she with you why, because she would never come to something like this
she's intensely private
back to work, everyone She's not here
Hey, listen Have you read the reviews?
they are...love letters listen to this one
Oh here
Simone has the voice of young Jane Fonda
the body of Sophia Loren
the grace of, well, Grace Kelly, ha ha and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel almost right
I can't wait to meet her - I don't know that's gonna happen - Why not?
she's some kind of recluse
that's how she stays so pure
she isolates herself in the art
vector, it's my studio
Elaine, it's my actor
there're other studios, Elaine
there is only one Simone ok, have your way, Viktor
Hello, Walter
nobody came in or went out just like you said Mr. Taransky - Mr Taranksy - Yes?
is Miss Simone coming in today?
she's already here She arrived before you got here
she's gonna leave long after you're gone
remember under no circumstances are you or anybody else never to enter this set Without my express permission undertood yes, sir
Mr. Taranksy
what if it catches on fire?
let it burn
welcome to Simulate One
welcome to Simone
good morning, Simone
good moning, Mr Taransky
Simone, a star is digitized
do you know what this means?
we have stepped into a new dimension
our ability to manuafcture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it
I am the death of real
the death of real
death of real
too much Meryl Streep
little less Streep
more
Bacall
is this better, Mr Taransky
much
while we are at it
there is a little something I want to add to your repertoire
remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in Breafast in Tiffany's?
how do I look
give me Audrey
perfect
perfect, Simone
perfect
Oh, God
I'm so relaxed around you
I'm so myself
you did create me
I just brought someone else's dream to life
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you
I was computer code
I was 1s and 0s
I was nothing
well
it's true
I don't wanna boast, but...
are you ever gonna tell truth about me, Mr. Taransky
I'm gonna tell the truth about you. Why wouldn't I?
of course
with Hank's tragic passing
the secret died with him
this is a classic case I've read about it
of technology and search of an artist
someone with integrity, someone with vision Someone who can see
see beyond
this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood
someone who can see
that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake
that the scales have tipped
naturally in favor of the fake
someone who can see that if a performance is genuine
doesn't matter the actors are real or not
and what's real anymore?
most actors these days have digital work done to them
so it's a gray area
the only real truth is the work
I'm gonna tell the truth about you
after your next picture
you're so beautiful
you're too beautiful
we're gonna fix that
is this on?
I would not be taking any questions regarding Simone
I do however have a statement to read On her behalf
to whom it may concern,
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film
at this time I will be conducting no interview or making publicity appearances
I politely request that the press respect my privacy
and let the work speak for itself
yours truly Simone
Viktor, Viktor
who is Simone dating?
Viktor, where did you find her?
her longer real name?
did I make it clear?
no questiones regarding Simone
I will make my final statement
miss Simone begins production on her new film today Eternity Forever
this is a project which has been near and dear to my heart
since I wrote it nine years ago
thank you
do you answer questions regarding Hank?
Hank
who asked me about Hank?
tell me why the movie is dedicated to Hank. Are they involved?
they were at one time in Cyprus yes
and now
now, I'd sadly to say only in spirit
thank you
your car will be ready in just a minute Mr. Taransky
we gave you complimentary car wash
Oh, really
Yeah, they're cleaning the engine now
thank you
Viktor, hey
Hal, wow
I'm so happy for us
the film, the chemistry I mean I have nothing against Nicola Anders
but I think that...
that Simone and I, we really worked great together
well, you were never really together
still, the connection was undeniable, you can't...
look, I have not read Eternity Forever, but it is...
it is fantastic
can I know that I'd be perfect for the part of Clive
Clyde, right, that's what I'm talking about yes, perfect, come on
look, I ran into Simone on the lot
Really? She never mention it
she's very busy right now People come from all angles
maybe she don't want you to know
I...
I strongly sensed that she thought that I would be perfect for Clyde as well, strongly - Excuse me - Sure
hello
Simone, it's so great to hear from you How are you, sweetheart?
you'll never guess who I'm with
you met him on the lot the other day
it was more in passing
but you're not even close, Hal
Hal Sinclair
what's wrong now?
your co-star - I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation
no, I don't think he put on weight
anyway, listen Do you think he'll be right for Eternity Forever?
he's not the type
Really? You wanna go another direction
well - I'll try and talk her into it, don't worry - Anything, you'll be director, anything
Yeah, listen honey
well, is this some kind of jamming device
this is a bad place to talk about things
maybe he's just talking to himself
Taransky is not that good an actor
honey, I know you wanna do charity work - I know you wanna give back - Taking special precautions
some kind of new encryption
why would they do that?
you gotta remember, your greatest gift is your talent I wouldn't talk about that, sweetheart
whatever it is
it's dark
dark
yeah
very
we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend
can you ever stop doing that?
Why?
you'll lose yourself on that thing.
you gotta get out more. How are you gonna meet boys?
dad, I knew plenty of boys
you do , who
and where did you meet them? You meet them in those chatrooms?
how do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away
beautiful today Let's go outside eat
Lainey, leave the computer, please
OK
dad, it might be better to eat inside
stay here
what is this?
what the hell is going on? What are you doing here?
you trespass
you can't hide her forever
Simone appears only when I want her to appear
sounds like a prisoner or do you hold her hostage
you're in the hostage I mean you look kind of captive to me
Lainey don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone
just as sound, I know what you are Dad
Bye, Dad
bye honey
Hello, Viktor
sorry I... got her back late Oh, no problem
Hey, you wanna come in
Hi. Hi. honey - Hi! Vic Kent
Viktor, we simplly have to discuss Eternity Forever
I thought I haven't received Simone's script notes
there aren't any
if the filmmakers are happy, she's happy
she considers herself a... an instrument
Oh so she's really gonna do all this nudity
if it's on the page
well, we have to do something about this budget, Viktor
it's completely unrealisitic
I mean, you allowed nothing for limousine service
she drives herself - Hair and makeup - Does her own
the theater training
Oh, she was in a theater, where?
you want her resume, I'll send it to you
OK, great, thanks
ah at least, Viktor. Contingency for wardrobe, anybody can go up a size
I guarantee she will not gain an once
she is so disciplined
well, we've got to do something about this, Viktor - Stuntwoman - What about it?
there isn't one - I don't need one - Does all her own stunts - Even the fall from the plane
even the fall from the plane
well, shoot it on the last day
listen, Viktor
I want to talk to you now
not as Elaine studio head
but, as Elaine ex-wife
Hey, second ex-wife
seriously
you got lucky this last time but, you need to be careful
we both know that you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you haven't convinced Simone to be in it
Elaine, talking to you now not as Viktor director but as Viktor your first former hunsband
what happened to you
experiences, Viktor
that's what happened to me
Yeah, I've seem this a hundred times Really
Yeah, these young stars , destroying the very people who discovered them
I am worried about you, Viktor that's all
this woman, she controls your destiny
she doesn't control my destiny
there's something about her I don't trust
Hi, Jane
thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky
I know it looks like I sided with the studio But I've always believed in you honestly
don't worry about that. I understand. Are they...?
Ah, they're all here. - OK, thank you
Hi, Viktor
I just want to say I'm delighted to have such a wonderfu cast
assembled here for Eternity Forever
a reminder as a condition for working on this picture
you will not be rehearsing with Simone
you will not be shooting with Simone
actually you are fobidden from contacting Simone at anytime for any reason whatsoever - Yes - Works for me
how do you shoot our love scenes?
body double for her for you
anyway, Simone insists speaking with you herself before the filming starts
I believe she's on the line now
Simone, are you there
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky
so are we, Simone
why don't you leave me alone with my costars, Mr. Taransky
so we can get to know each other better
absolutely I'll be back in a minute
Hi, who's there Don't be shy, introduce yourselves
I'm Mac, I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here - Hi, Simone, I'm Crow - Hi I'm Clarice, you used to take my cousin down
I'm Hewlit, we can rehearse in private if you like
my name is Lotus
I can't believe I'm talking to you
we're gonna become such good friends
Hi, Simone, it's Hal
it's great to be working together...again
is that everyone, well obviously you know I'm Simone
who else?
I just wanna to start by apologizing for my process
I know it's an unusual way to work
but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there
Oh, of course, of course
I don't have much to say execept that I know it's gonna be a great poject if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision
always do what Mr. Taransky says If in doubt, do it the Taransky way
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together
together
absolutely
Veronica
what you don't understand Clyde is the love
still too big, I like it But it's too big
alright, smaller teardrops this time
what you don't understand, Clyde
is the love
it's like a wild flower but that flower only grows on the edge of a very high cliff
perfect
Simone
Simone
Simone
gonna be a little change in plan, Simone
you have no idea
the effect your performance is having on pople
we can't stop now
these films, there's speaking to the human conditions
we are changing lives
people need to believe you're real to reveal the truth now It'll be cruel
you're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky
why do you have to bring up them?
I mean
living is a risk
it is worth it, isn't it?
we've done enough work today
cooped up in there too long
so how about you and I going out on the town
tonight they're gonna see you with their own eyes
excuse me
I will be checking in a very special guest Miss Enomis
Ah, Miss Enomis
now Miss Enomis demands her privacy so...
you will switch off all surveillance cameras
I alone will escort Miss Enomis to her room via the rear exit
she was not to be disturbed at any time for any reason whatsoever
I'm sure I can rely on your descretion
understood, sir
thank you "Simone
who is it?
it's Simone
OK, I think everybody's here
now!
I think we're alright now
Oh, thank God for you, Faith, thank God for you
I mean
this is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in
I must tell you
you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone
shielding her from these animals
Oh no Mr. Taransky Thank God for you
Yeah, how many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress, incredible
you know, we're gonna have to go back to my place
just to, you know, keep them off the scent
of course
you are so...
so, so much like, like her?
Oh yes, of course like her But you're so, you're so very beautiful
in your own right
I, I do find myself strangely attracted to you Mr. Taransky
call me Viktor
Viktor
Viktor
this is so exciting
do all you do to Simone
what? What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone - What I do to Simone? - Call me Simone - Simone? - Yes, say it again
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night
please call me Simone
you're with me so you can be close to her
is that a problem?
OK
excuse me just for a minute
is there something wrong?
well, actually
maybe we can do this some other time
are you busy tomorrow?
gentlemen, the presidential suite
think that should take care of everything
Yes, sir I'll make it well
leave me for a moment
Simone
Elaine, there she is
the picture, the picture it's a revelation
thank you, thank you
Oh we're working so hard
ya, it was all of us, it was all of us
Cheers, it was incredible
thank you all
thank you
Viktor, she here? Hey, Viktor, she here?
well I'm fine Hal, how are you?
someone says she's here. Where is she?
Jesus! It's her glass
Jack Daniels straight-up, my kind of woman
look, where is she?
I don't know, she's...
is that her by the fountain?
you know between you and me
she doesn't really exist - Simone - Simone
Simone's here
why didn't anybody told me?
she's here? Simone
I got her glass
get out!
not you two
she goes to a major Hollywood A-list party
and we don't get an interview
a comment We don't even get a photograph
is that what you're telling me?
nobody got a photograph
nobody ever gets a photograph - We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer - Get better people
what about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
they've camped out every place he goes
every concierge, every maitre d' are all on the take
but this Simone woman is good
obviously that is not her real name
she uses an assumed identity
she travels under a false name checks into hotels with an alias
never stays in the same hotel two nights in a row
what about the satellite photo? What happened?
nothing
nothing from space?
what about the fingerprints? What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
well we've had some of Taransky's fingerprints
a lot of yours
and none of hers
no one is that perfect
that pure
you know I had something on Mother Theresa once
and then she died Just wouldn't worth anymore
I, I know how to flush out this Simone woman
a tell-all story from her childhood
you have one?
I will, when you're finished writing it.
please, please don't make me do this
Walt, please open this door right now
Mr. Taransky came with specific instructions never open up this door
no, what are you doing? Why did you do this?
Viktor, we have to talk to her, Viktor
we know she's in there, Viktor
well OK, OK, what is all this about?
we've got the tracking numbers for Eternity Forever - They're in the toilet - She's gotta get out and sell the film
what do you want her to do? Go door to door?
my God, even Garble would be on talk show circuit if she was alive today
it is precisely because that she doesn't crave the limelight
that people lover her
she is about the work, and only the work
Viktor, she is overshadowing the work
if you can't handle it, I will
it is not a good time
she's emotional, today
her mother dies
scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing."
this is not a good time
it never is, Viktor - Step off side - Go, go!
this is ridiculous!
no, no, what are you doing?
I trusted you - Simone - You can come out, it's Elaine - We just wanna have a meeting - We can talk, girl to girl, just us - Viktor, where is she? - She's gone
where are the sets?
God, I so like her
where are the cameras?
what is all this, Viktor?
what is all this?
well
I suppose... It's gonna come out sooner or later
I guess I'm...
I'm actually believed in a way
I can just say it finally
she's a computer ...addict - What? - She's a computer addict!
she's buried in here Day in and day out
of course she is, I should've guessed that's why she's never, goes somewhere
why she's not seen in the public - Now you're getting it - Why she spends her whole life in chatrooms?
it's one place she can be herself - Anonymous - Only it's worse, it's far more worse
she's extremely agoraphobic
she has a morbid fear of people
Of...germs, poises, heights, name it
Oh, this is terrible, how she's gonna plug the film?
Yes, yes - Viktor, she has to do publicity
well, maybe I could get her to do something - Maybe a television talk show - Yes, yes, good - Taped - Oh, make it live, please
she'd never go there So would have to be remote
we can work with that
I can't promise anything - We understand - Alright, that's enough
thank you, thank you
don't grobble
Viktor, thank you - That agoraphobia -- it's like a plague. - It's out of control in Europe
it's so good of us to protect her like that - Don't touch it - Oh, germs
she was there She was right there
Oh my gosh
she didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me
actually she did
She...she said that she thought you were...very beautiful
Really?
yeah
would you wanna go and get something to eat?
Oh Viktor, I'd love to, really, but...
don't you have to go to talk to Simone?
I can find her
well
alright, good, thanks, Viktor
I don't need a bye
tonight on Frank Brand Live
since taking the world by storm in her debut movie Sunrise, Sunset
no one has managed to land the live television interview
with this fabulous shooting starlet Simone until now
I'm happy to say she's agreed to talk with us tonight
from the set of her new film
welcome, Simone
so glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here
it's my pleasure
wonderful to be with you, Frank
no one can accuse you being over exposed, Simone
why have you stayed completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors just talk too much
I mean this world really wanna hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
wow, huh, she is all woman
of course the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
don't I know it?
but the only reason I'm here now
is to put the attention back where it belongs
on Mr. Taransky's film
and you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it
you see after tonight
I'll have as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies
now how is that healthy for a performer?
because you have to understand, Frank
none of this is real
who I am on screen and who I really am
they are two totally different people
change of topic, Simone
you have been romanticly linked to dozens of men in the press
Mick Jagger, Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro and most recently Viktor Taransky
is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
no, Frank, I'l d rather not to discuss my private life here
but Viktor and I, we're inseperable
Oh Viktor, you dog
I wouldn't be here today without him
would you like a moment, Simone?
no, I'm okay
OK
then let's talk about the work you care so much about
sure, where would you like to start, Frank
how about the nudity?
I know where that is
nudity's never been an issue for me
I know that tree
clothes are simple an option
I know that tree, I know where that is
what exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I supposed what I liked most about the movies I made
is that they're not about special effects
and they are better for it, I might add "Insufficient memory
we appear to be having some satellite difficulties
and, but before we lose you completely
Simone, I just want to say thank you
thank you, Frank
goodbye
ladies and gentlemen, Simone
I've been here before On my honeymoon with my ex-wife
Yeah, look, see that's the exact same tree
and look in the distance, that's...
the mountain
hotel
I don't understand
could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
get in the car "Eternity Forever" has a big future at box office
we don't get the photos You don't get the cover, simple as that
yes
written answers to written questions
didn't we have this conversation before?
website interviews, no problem
I think people are gonna love Eternity Forever
eternity Forever is my finest work
I love to work with the director of Eternity Forever
he's a genius
you wish
it's wonderful being a movie star
and there are so many other ways I want to express myself
but it's not enough to be a movie star You have to be a pop star too
if you really wanna make a difference
nice boat, Taransky
not a boat, it's a yacht
I know what you're up to
you know, I really don't have time for this
I think you do, cause I know it's a fake
it's bogus
you used an old library shot for the background
she never was in Mexico She never left the studio
she was never in Mexico, never even left the studio.
done my homework studied her.
bet you have.
I've looked into every piece of publicity she's done.
and as far as I can tell, there is no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh, and...for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.
now I've obtained the paper of your bank account.
OK, I know you have the power of attorney.
but so far you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in her trust.
Yeah, I know that that's what you want people to believe
but I gotta tell you embezzlement is a serious matter, not to mention abduction - Abduction? - Yeah
off the record, I just... I wanna know how you're doing it.
is it drugs, is it mind control, is it blackmail, is it all the three?
what do you do? Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What...is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
and unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I'll show these photos to the authorities.
you wanna see her?
alright.
you've got a deal.
you wanna see her, you're gonna see her.
good
Mr. Taransky - Ah, hello, gentlemen - We're ready, Mr. Taransky.
this time tomorrow night she'll be standing right here in front of hundreds of thousands of people.
we could've sold this out twenty times.
Yeah, the sound check went great and Laser show is good to go
gotta ask you that, you've ordered an awful lot of smoke
well, that's the way she wants it built.
after you've told us about the death threats,
security guards are under strict instruction - Never to take their eyes off the crowd - Good good excellent - Here, Simone wants you to have these as well. - Unreal.
and remember, no cameras, no binoculars
ladies and gentlemen,
Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone live on stage for the debut concert of her Splendid Isolation tour.
so get your hair and makeup.
no
no
yes
I know it's easier to make a hundred thousand believe than just one.
and now, the one the only Simone
I love you.
l. A. it's great to be here.
lookin' out on the morning' rain
I used to feel so inspired.
and when I knew I had to face another day, oh, it made me feel so tired.
before the day I met you,
life was so unkind, your love key to my peace of mind.
cause you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like a natural woman.
Oh, baby, what you've done to me.
you make me feel so good inside.
and I just wanna be close to you, you make me feel so alive.
cause you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like a natural woman.
you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like I'm real.
you make me feel,
you make me feel,
feel like I got you.
you make me feel like I'm real.
Simone, Simone, Simone!
thank you.
never stop believing.
Yeah, Simone, ooh yeah.
she's done to me.
Ooh, natural woman.
I said I didn't wanna be disturbed.
Viktor.
my two favorite girls in all the world.
Oh, we just stop by to congratulate Simone.
Ah, well, you know, she's...lying down, she's exhausted
Yeah, I can imagine.
listen, thank Simone for the tickets, OK?
that's a good color on you.
it was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this taking advantage of him this way.
it's cruel.
Why?
obviously, this can't last.
she's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that. He's too sensitive.
it'll destroy him
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her
I've been meaning to talk to you.
Elaine, I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
dad.
Oh, hi baby, thank you.
so how's your love life, Lainey?
I do okay. What about you?
well, you know me married to my work.
I noticed.
dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now
she broke up with Kent.
she thinks you're with Simone.
Oh, Lainey, that's ridiculous. I don't have a relationship with Simone
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.if Simone spoke to her,she could straighten things out.
dinner, maybe.
dinner?
I don't know about dinner
that'd be difficult, I think.
maybe a phone call?
it's too impersonal. They have to meet face-to-face.
I'll think of something.
the escalating violence, tragic loss of human lives, and threats to all our world was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations - Hello - Hello?
is this Elaine? - Who's this?
Oh my God, is that you, Simone?
Yes, you look beautiful today.
Thanks, where are you?
I'm right here.
beside you.
I borrowed Viktor's car - Hi - Hi
I'm really late I'd love to talk to you
but I'm on my way to CeBit right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh? No, oh. Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
it's strictly a working relationship.
I just... I don't wanna see Viktor get hurt.
sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor. I could never love anyone.
I, I... I'm in love with the camera.
Simone
I...I recognize the coat you're wearing I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ!
Elaine, I just...
God, oh my God. I'll tell you.
are you alright, Simone?
I'm... This does look awful, I know that
but...
Viktor, he's just so crazy about you. Could you go to the Oscars with him?
no, no no no no no.
if you won't do it for him,
I ask you please do it for me.
OK, OK, for you.
for you, I'll go.
Oh, thank you - Well, here's my exit - Alright, I'm glad that we've talked - Oh, yes, bye - Bye
goodbye.
and the winner of Best Actress is...
Oh my goodness, we have a tie.
the winners are Simone for Sunrise, Sunset.
thank you and, Simone for Eternity Forever.
unfortunately Simone cannot be with us here tonight, but thanks to the miracle of modern technology.
she joins us live from her goodwill tour of the Third World.
ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
thank you.
Oh,thank you. This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
first I wanna acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category.
let alone with these wonderful human beings.
and I'd also wanna thank my co-stars,
and the studio, of course.
and as always I dedicate this to Hank
without whom none of this would be possible
I love you, Hank.
wherever you are.
thank you.
who's Hank? Her agent?
her father?
why didn't she thank you?
she did, didn't she?
no.
and of course,I must thank my collaborator Viktor Taransky.
without whom none of this would be possible.
and of course I must thank my collaborator Viktor Taransky
without whom none of this would be possible.
why didn't I say it?
how could I forget to say it?
who wrote it?
and of course I must thank my collaborator Viktor Taransky.
without whom none of this would be possible.
excuse me, Mr. Taransky.
are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola's here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
so much has happened, since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
why don't you sit and talk?
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on Sunrise.
that's OK.
I know, I understand.
when I saw what Simone did with the role.
I mean...
I fired all my people.
I went to rehab, took some acting classes, changed my ... whole look.
she really, really inspired me.
would you like me to read?
ah sure Now we can go.
who do you think you are, Carlos?
coming in here like this?
my husband sleeping in the next room.
do you think I won't call out?
do you think I will just give in to you without a fight?
like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
that was just...wonderful.
wonderful acting.
you could play the lead.
isn't that Simone's part?
of course.
of course it is.
you have...such a beautiful line.
right un...right there.
it's not a wrinkle, honey.
it's like a, like a, like a dimple, right?
when you're smiling, I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah, that would be crazy. That would be crazy.
would you like me to try some difference with this or do it again?
no, it's fine.
OK.
thank you.
thank you, Viktor.
happy birthday, Lainey.
what do you think?
fantastic.
it's what, what she drove in Eternity Forever.
I know.
see.
you have to thank her for me.
well, for both of us, until you get your permit, but...
you can take it around the lot now.
what's the matter?
can't accept it.
Why?
why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
what do you want?
well, I can get you whatever you want, sweetie.
the old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this clinging to Simone's coattails, it used to be all about the work.
and now it's all about her.
and then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
no, that was me.
there you go again, blaming yourself.
can't you see what she's done to you.
she's taking advantage, mocking you.
you deserve better than Simone.
I have to go, Dad.
Oh sure, she comes in all the time - Really?
is she nice? - We've become very close - She told she wants to look into my script next week - Jane
gotta go.
I'm leaving early
so if anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood, I just wanna drop by.
you don't use the front door anymore?
Ah...no!
when is she coming over?
now, now.
OK, I'll just stay until she gets here.
well she is...
already here.
what?
Elaine.
Simone is not coming over tonight.
or...or any other night.
I want you back, Elaine.
I want you back too, Viktor.
Viktor, wait, Viktor.
this is crazy, Viktor.
we're kidding, I can't compete with Simone.
what woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
you're so sweet, Viktor.
no, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice, Viktor.
no, no.
kind of strange that I've stabbed people in the back and...
clawed and slept my way to where I am - You have? - Well, it goes with the territory, but...
for some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't, I don't know. There's a goodness to her.
Oh no. There's nothing to her.
Oh, Viktor.
Viktor. You say that now.
in the morning, you would go back to her - You would - No
you would, Viktor.
she's gonna retire.
she'll never work again.
of course, she will.
her public will demand it.
not if I don't let her - You? - Yeah
how can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
every actor is an invention, Viktor.
look, you're lucky, she's loyal enough to stay with you.
maybe she's staying out of ... pity, who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you, Viktor.
listen, she's thin air.
she's pixels - What? - Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation.
I inherited it from a madman.
how much you've had drinked, Viktor?
there is no Simone. I'm Simone.
you're Simone?
I've done the impossibles.
I have recreated the infinite nuisances of a human being and human soul.
I have taken nothing
and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
I've made a miracle.
Viktor, please stop.
please.
I swear, Elaine as God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simon, I made her - You made Simone? - Yes.
Viktor
she made you.
you bitch.
I'll destroy you directed by Simone.
Bravo!
I Am Pig.
had a rough night?
you made me?
I made you first.
we'll go back on Good Morning, Good Day.
and we're here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you're taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all our elementary schools should have a firing range.
help these children learn to defend themselves.
if there's a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?! God, isn't it crowded enough?!
but God created fur animals to be worn.
have you ever tasted dolphins.
pan fried with a little garlic.
everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
but look at the benefits.
I mean you don't eat as much.
when you've got something to hold in your hand.
we always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
she speaks her mind.
Oh, she certainly does.
it's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
she killed you, Hank.
now she's killing me.
she's a serial killer.
but I don't know how to stop her.
I mean she's taken on a life of her own.
I, I can't just come clean.
you know, make some confession because I've defrauded millions, they'd turn on me.
I just, can't put the genie back in the bottle and make her lost.
if she suddenly stopped working.
you know, just dropped out of the sight.
they'd never let it rest.
I've tried killing her career, but they like her even more.
Hank.
what am I gona do?
not another word, Hank.
you are truly a genius.
thank you, Hank, Thank you.
what's the matter, Viktor?
you look so sad.
don't you love me anymore?
it's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
this is a phoney-baloney world.
we're all living one big lie.
so why shouldn't you live too?
you're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
and that's the problem.
you're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work, but if that was the truth, it wouldn't matter to me and it does, it does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
here I was trying to convince the whole world.
you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was to convince that I exist.
it's not that you aren't human, it's that I am Plague Ver. 8. 1.
it is my sad and solemn duty to announce the tragic passing of Simone.
how did she die?
it was a rare virus she contracted.
on her goodwill tour of the third world.
did she suffer?
mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
it's a great loss.
you know we're gonna have to restruct your deal.
can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend.
Viktor, how could you bring that up at a time like this?
one minute, Mr. Taransky.
this is gotta be a mistake.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I don't understand - Viktor.
dad.
that's why it was so light.
I heard him say, " Die bitch! I'll destroy you.
so strange.
he actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
he's a sick man.
he was a controlling madman she was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I've done more to stop it.
forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand.
now all these films, TV appearances, magazine covers internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood.
all fake.
this is fake, this is fake fake, fake, fake, all fake.
Yes.
you understand perfectly.
so I will confess to fraud, not murder.
and a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions.
that's also bogus.
no.
no. The fan club is real.
just what they were worshipping is computer code ones and zeros.
so you couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
right, exactly.
and this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about.
a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself.
Oh, no no.
this whole thing is insane.
there is no Simone.
look, even her name is fake.
it's not Simone.
it's Sim One.
see? Simulation One.
it's a computer code.
you really hated her, didn't you?
perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky or is this tape "doctored" too?
this is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question.
altered, of course.
can you tell us why you are just disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
well, it's not her body.
it's her body of work.
Viktor Viktor, Viktor, Viktor
Viktor, I know.
look Look, look, look.
why don't you just come clean?
tell the truth. You're gonna feel better afterwards.
well I'm telling the truth.
and I don't feel so good.
we all know what happened.
in a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I didn't, I can prove， I can prove it to you.
let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
here, here, come on.
we can just go there, can't we?
let's just go there, I'll take you there.
OK, good.
thank you, good work.
now you'll see.
what is this?
no, these are drives and discs.
where are the discs?
you have to go back down and get... Because that's where they are.
we can't go back down there.
there's discs down there.
please just just.
you must go down there and get the drives.
hey you see what's down there?
Simone's Body Feared Eaten By Sharks.
plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
it's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah, yeah.
you certainly will if you go to trial a jury in this kind of ugly mood.
you've killed an icon, for God's sake.
bernard - Viktor.
listen to me, Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on. It's in the paper.
there's no one to kill.
bernard I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
so, I created her.
bernard There's no one to kill.
do you understand?
an insanity defence.
beautiful.
fantastic.
what are you doing?
I created her.
Viktor, Jesus, Jesus Christ.
what am I doing?
got me out - Viktor.
why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?
you know I can almost forgive him for killing her but to deny her existence.
I can never forgive that.
because obviously she existed, right?
I know it as surely as you're sitting there, sweetheart.
she was the most vital woman I have ever met.
so you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey. What are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture-deal with an actress I have never met?
no, no I mean really meet her like in the flesh
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close.
touched her been in her physical presence.
have you?
well, I...
we don't wanna believe dad because we don't wanna believe that we were taken in too.
but, Lainey there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
listen to what you're saying, mom.
is there any evidence that she is?
do you have any idea what you're doing?
what's that?
one part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
certain viruses can be cured.
I've no idea what you're talking about.
listen to me.
this psychiatrist in Ventura, well respected who's willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity due to the trauma of your divorce ten years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child
no more.
I can't go along with this horseshit!
come on, Viktor - I did it - No no Viktor come on no
tell them they can fry me!
no, Viktor, please - I did it - No Viktor please
it was premeditated.
I strangled her! I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire! And then I killed her!
I did it!
excuse me.
I think you'd better see this.
breaking news: International media star Simone is alive and well
her studio released this footage just minutes ago
Simone reading today's edition of the L. A. Times.
who says, "The only bad publicity is your obituary"?
details at the top of the hour.
she's indestructible.
he's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor, oh.
Oh honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it
Oh well, it was Lainey But don't thank us too fast, Viktor.
you know what we have to do now.
what?
well.
why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
you have to finish what you've started.
we can do it together.
haven't we done enough?
could we go, please?
where are we going?
well I was thinking.
how about you and Simone moving in with me and Lainey
that's wonderful.
what do you think, Lainey?
about you and Mom?
well.
about me and Simone.
what I did, everything.
I'm sorry
your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad
we're fine with fake as long as you don't lie about it.
Oh come on, Viktor.
it's not a death sentence.
no.
it's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us.
we probably never met.
I'm, I'm Milton How are you?
Max.
it's life.
please call, 5 minutes, All we need is 5 minutes.
good evening and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do living in this fish bowl the insatiable appetite of the media.
with everything that was going on in my life.
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed a time. And Viktor bought me that time.
I owe him so much.
we all do.
but now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
it's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
and what may I ask brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
that beautiful baby - Yes
you see Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Yes.
what are you gonna do when you run outta gas, caII AAA?
you sucker for the babes, you.
you ain't even gonna make it to the pits.
you shut the heII up. I'II make it.
not unIess you keep your eyes on the road, sugar pie.
watch it!
Ah, this is great.
just Iike being in a buddy movie.
shut up!
boy, you're screwed. You're out. You're finished.
stick a fork in it. You're swirIing around the bottom of the bowI, nose-diving down the pipe.
Oh. It's over.
you're fIushed.
this time, I can't bring myseIf to teII him to shut up.
sure, he's an asshoIe.
sure, he's dead.
sure, I'm just imagining that he's taIking.
none of that stops the bastard from being absoIuteIy right.
I don't have a chance in heII of outrunning this cop.
not in this heap.
puII over!
the onIy question Ieft is whether I'm gonna kiII him or not.
tough caII.
for aII I know, he's an honest cop, reguIar guy, a working stiff with a mortgage, a wife and a piIe of kids.
my hand moves aII on its own, sIiding one of my guns to my Iap and thumbing back the hammer.
I don't know what to do. - You better stop. You're making him mad.
whatever you say.
your friend here... party a IittIe too hard tonight?
I'm the designated driver.
weII, you're driving with a busted taiI Iight.
I'II Iet you off with a warning.
what next?
the tank goes dry a quarter mile from the pits.
I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.
a few minutes' more work and it'll all be over.
Jackie Boy will go into the damn tar pits.
I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks. go home and call it a...
no more questions, DaIIas. Do what I say.
cIear the streets. We're in Iockdown.
we're not seIIing any taiI in OId Town.
not tonight.
don't struggIe. You'II onIy hurt yourseIf.
your cause is Iost.
we know everything.
soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty wiII be in our possession, and the truce between your prostitutes and the poIice wiII be shattered.
There'II be arrests. There'II be deaths.
my empIoyer wiII seize what remains of this neighborhood.
you wiII aII be sIaves. Nothing can stop this.
but it is within your power to save many Iives by faciIitating the process of transition, by negotiating the terms of the surrender of OId Town.
son of a bitch! I know you.
I have suffered your kind before - the dregs of Sin City.
I serve a new master now, and soon you and aII your wretched kind wiII serve him as weII.
now, get dressed and shed a tear for Dwight McCarthy if you must, because, by now, he is sureIy dead.
you don't know him.
my man wiII find a way.
he aIways finds a way.
I can't fathom these Americans aIways whining and going on about how they got it so bad.
this is a fine, grand country.
guiding Iight of the modern worId, it is.
low taxes, Iand of opportunity.
where eIse wouId one buIIet buy us the fortune that we're getting for this?
sure beats the Iiving heII out of bIowing up airports and churches without shite to show for it.
Yeesh.
you find something, Murphy?
looks to be our poor, dead cop's badge.
it's aII bent up.
what's this stuck in it?
bIoody heII. It's the buIIet.
you son of a bitch! Bastard!
they weren't cops. these four.
they were mercenaries.
and if they were hired by who I think they were.
the bad times haven't even started yet.
and everything seemed to be going so well.
remember, we don't have to deIiver every Iast inch of the man, Brian.
you got a good point there, Ronnie.
lend me your knife.
shouId I take a nap whiIe I'm doing aII this waiting?
I'm at the bone, aII right?
there we go.
have you ever seen anything so pretty in your whoIe Iife?
we'II be back for the three of you, and if anyone happens by, use your imagination, OK?
silence. now.
no air to breathe.
only the horrid. oily tar taste creeping up my nostrils.
let it in. Let it fill your lungs.
they were counting on you and you blew it.
skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.
Miho. you're an angel.
you're a saint.
you're Mother Teresa.
you're Elvis.
you're God.
and if you'd shown up ten minutes earlier. we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.
Dwight, they got GaiI!
it's a cinch. You got yourseIves a spy in OId Town.
a stooIie who soId you out to the mob.
we gotta find out who it is and rescue GaiI.
but first, we gotta get our hands on Jackie Boy's head before it gets to wherever it's going and this whoIe situation bIows wide open.
miho, I hope to heII you Ieft one of 'em aIive enough to taIk.
I let him know I'm not fooling around.
we talk.
stay smart. Stay cool.
it's time to prove to your friends that you're worth a damn.
sometimes. that means dying.
sometimes. it means killing a whole lot of people.
there they are. What do we do?
we stop 'em, DaIIas.
Jackie Boy's head is so close to me
I could almost reach out and grab it right then and there.
get the head! Get the head!
I got it! I got it!
suck on this, you stupid sIag!
I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead.
but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me wants to get some killing done.
you want the head now, sweetheart? So come down and get it!
brave Iad.
I couId've put a buIIet straight down your ear just now, if I hadn't got me revoIver aII wet and useIess.
you got the drop on me, Iove.
I'm as heIpIess as a baby.
I got to come cIean with you, sweetheart.
it was an outright Iie I was giving ya about me revoIver being wet.
you see, I'm not too fond of shootin'.
it's my preference to bIow things up.
once you bIast the roof off a pub and seen aII the parts fIying off peopIe, a IittIe bang bang's never gonna match the sight of that.
and here's me, with aII these fine grenades and such a sweet beauty of a remote.
but it's me knife I'II be doing you with.
you kiIIed me mates.
someone shouIda toId ya - never give an Irishman good cause for revenge.
deadly little Miho.
you won't feel a thing unless she wants you to.
she twists the blade.
he feels it.
I tell Miho what we're gonna do and how we're gonna do it.
I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make the most important call of my life.
first. We gotta rescue Gail. then comes the kill.
the big. fat kill.
do we just gotta stand here and watch this?
what, are you kidding me, man?
I couId watch oId Manute do his thing aII night Iong and not get tired of it.
I mean, the man's an artist.
onIy an artist shouId be aIIowed to touch such a beautifuI subject.
your skin is perfect.
your nerves, responsive.
beautifuI.
just give them what they want, GaiI.
Becky? - It's over, GaiI.
there's no fighting them. Dwight's dead.
they got what's Ieft of that cop we kiIIed.
the mob's gonna turn it over to the poIice chief, the cops are gonna mow us down.
we gotta cut a deaI.
you IittIe bitch! You soId us out!
I didn't have no choice! They was gonna hurt my mom.
you gotta cut a deaI with these peopIe.
it's seIfish, you hoIding out Iike this.
you're gonna get a Iot of girIs kiIIed for no good reason.
it wasn't your mom!
we couId have protected her and you know it.
it was the money, you stupid IittIe bitch!
sure, there's money. Sure, you couId've moved my mom into OId Town and Iet her know that her daughter's a goddamn whore.
breaks your heart, doesn't it?
they offered me what you couIdn't never offer me - a way out.
I had to watch out for my own neck.
your neck.
your precious, scrawny IittIe neck!
you're crazy! You couId have ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!
schutz, fetch my bIades.
Stuka, kiII this one. - No, I was promised!
stupid IittIe bitch! You deserve worse!
I knew there was a reason I got out of bed this morning.
Hey.
Hey.
nobody. I don't see nobody.
wiII you Iook at that? It's right through me. Guys, Iook.
there's something wrapped around it.
some kind of note.
give it to me.
it's poked right through me. Guys, Iook.
it's starting to reaIIy hurt. - Out back. Everyone.
and bring the women.
do you think somebody shouId caII me a doctor or something?
mccarthy, you fooI.
Hey.
guys?
Aw.
dozens of them. armed to the teeth.
I'm outnumbered. outgunned.
but the alley is crooked. dark and very narrow.
they can't surround me.
sometimes. you can beat the odds with the careful choice of where to fight.
you can have OId Town, I don't care.
just give me the woman.
shut up.
Dwight, don't do this.
Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right. - Shut up, or I'II pIug you!
of course, Mr. McCarthy. A fair trade.
she's aII yours.
now, if you'II expIain to me why we shouIdn't bIow both of you to pieces...
Dwight, what have you done?
exactIy what I had to.
every step of the way.
No! It isn't right! There wasn't no tape over his mouth!
how come there's tape over his mouth?
where to fight counts for a lot.
cute trick, McCarthy, but it wiII do you do good.
but there's nothing like having your friends show up with lots of guns.
No! McCarthy, you shit!
the girls all know the score.
no escape. no surrender. no mercy.
we gotta kill every last rat bastard one of 'em.
every last one.
not for revenge. not because they deserve it.
not because it'll make the world a better place.
we need a heap of bloody bodies so when mob boss Wallenquist looks over his charts of profits and losses.
he'll see what it cost him to mess with the girls of Old Town.
they run out back.
right on schedule.
deadly little Miho.
she gets her practice in.
the Valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing with the pure. hateful. bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter.
and so am I.
the fire. baby.
it'll burn us both.
there's no place in this world for our kind of fire.
my warrior woman. my Valkyrie.
you'll always be mine.
always...
and never.
just one hour to go. My last day on the job.
early retirement. Not my idea.
doctor's orders. Heart condition.
'Angina. " he calls it.
I'm polishing my badge and getting myself used to the idea of saying goodbye to it.
it and the 30-odd years of protecting and serving and tears and the blood and terror and triumph it represents.
I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.
about the thick. fat steaks she picked up at the butcher's today.
and I'm thinking about the one loose end I haven't tied up.
a young girl who's out there somewhere. helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic.
damn it, Hartigan, I won't Iet you do this. You're gonna get yourseIf kiIIed.
you're gonna get us both kiIIed. I won't Iet you. I'm warnin' you.
let go of my coat, Bob.
you're draggin' me down with you.
I'm your partner. They can kiII me, too.
I ain't puttin' up with that. I'm gettin' on the horn and caIIing for backup.
sure, Bob. We'II just wait.
sit on our hands whiIe that Roark brat gets his sick thriIIs with victim number four.
victim number four!
Nancy CaIIahan, age 1 1 .
and she'II be raped and sIashed to ribbons.
and that backup that we're waitin' on wiII just so happen to show up just Iate enough for Roark to get back to his US Senator daddy.
take a deep breath, Hartigan.
settIe down and think straight.
you're pushin' 60 and you got a bum ticker.
you ain't savin' anyone.
you got a great attitude, Bob.
reaI credit to the force, you are.
EiIeen's at home waitin' for you. Think about EiIeen.
heck, Bob, maybe you are right.
I'm gIad to hear you're finaIIy taIkin' sense.
hell of a way to end a partnership.
hell of a way to start my retirement.
Nancy Callahan. age 1 1.
for all I know. she's dead already.
you've been a very good girI, Nancy.
you've been very quiet.
don't be scared.
we're gonna be taking you home reaIIy soon.
but first, we're going to introduce you to somebody.
he's a very nice man.
halfway to the warehouse where Weevil said they took her. and it hits.
wicked spot of indigestion.
at least that's what I pray it is.
...Iighthearted and momentary digression.
the briefest induIge-ment in automotive pIeasure.
for cheap thriIIs. Such short-Iived durabiIity, Mr. ShIubb.
you wouId risk engender-ating iII wiII on the part of our empIoyers.
Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump
two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs with delusions of eloquence.
this Jaguar you so pinheadedIy covet
temporariIy remanded to our custody though it may be
remains the property of the son of Senator Roark.
gotta keep this quiet. Take 'em down fast.
a singIe dent, the merest scratch thereupon, and the before-mentioned consequences of which I so recentIy made mention shaII sureIy be athwart us.
catch your breath. Give your heart time to slow down.
but it won't slow down.
get over it.
she needs you.
we're aII done here, Benny.
let's give them some time together. Give them some privacy.
be with you in a minute, Lenny.
I'm just making sure they get aIong reaIIy weII.
and what kind of beast couIdn't get aIong with a precious IittIe girI Iike this?
you must be awfuIIy scared now.
but you've got nothing to be scared of.
aII we're gonna do is have a nice IittIe taIk.
that's aII. Just a nice taIk. Just you and me.
don't you cry now.
doctor said it'd be like this.
just take the pill he gave you.
no need to play it quiet.
not anymore.
breathe steady. old man. Prove you're not completely useless.
what the hell? Go out with a bang.
he likes to hear 'em scream.
I've seen his victims and their twisted little faces.
all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed. frozen in their last horrible moment of living.
no screams. Either I'm just in time. or I'm way too late.
Ooh!
it's nothing. Barely a flesh wound. On your feet. old man.
Roark. Give it up.
let the girI go.
you can't do a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan.
you know who I am.
you know who my father is!
you can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop.
look at you. You can't even Iift that cannon you're carrying.
sure, I can.
cover your eyes, Nancy. I don't want you watching this.
I mean it, baby. Cover your eyes right now.
I take his weapons away.
both of them.
hell of a way to end a partnership.
for God's sakes, don't make it any worse.
don't make me kiII you. - Doin' fine, Bob.
never better.
I'm ready to kick your ass.
keep him talking. Buy time.
just a few more minutes. Just till the backup gets here.
sit down and stay down. I'II kiII you if I have to.
keep his mind off the girl - skinny little Nancy.
he can't kill her once the backup gets here.
run home, Nancy. Run for your Iife.
Hey. Don't Iisten to him. He's a crazy man.
what a tough man you are, huh? - You stay right where you're at.
you shoot your partner in the back...
then you try to scare a IittIe girI.
maybe I'II puII my spare rod, pIug you a coupIe of times, show you how it's done.
we couId've worked something out, but you've bIown that.
sit down or I'II bIast you in haIf.
you're so sIow, you'II never stop me. - Sit down!
you'II never be abIe to stop me.
I finally sit down. just like you told me to.
the sirens are close now.
she'll be safe.
things go dark. I don't mind much.
getting sleepy. It's OK.
she'll be safe.
an old man dies.
a little girl lives.
fair trade.
just teII me it isn't true, John.
what they're saying about you and that chiId.
it can't be true.
if you ever want to see me again...
say something now.
we're Iooking at your basic mountain of DNA evidence, the testimony of your own partner, corroboration by six eye-witnesses - and that's just so far
and there's your own siIence.
I'II do what I can, but needIess to say, you are good and screwed.
come on, Hartigan. What's hoIding you back?
what's shutting you up? This whoIe thing stinks to high heaven.
I'm not the onIy one on the force who smeIIs it.
sure, I'II rinse your bedpan and wipe your butt. That's my job.
but don't expect any friendIy chitchat outta me, mister.
I heard what you've done to that girI. I hope they throw away the key.
evenin', officer.
I don't have to introduce myseIf, do I? You read the papers.
this being an eIection year, you've seen pIenty of my picture.
you know who I am and what I can do.
and I'm doin' you, Hartigan.
coid and hard, I'm doing you.
you bIew my son's ear off.
you bIew his arm off. You even bIew his nuts and his pecker off.
he's in a coma right now. They say he may never come out of it.
my boy.
he couId've been the first Roark to become the President of the United States, but you went and turned him into a brain-damaged, dickIess freak.
PuIIin' that trigger make you feeI powerfuI?
power don't come from a badge or a gun.
power comes from Iying.
lying big, and gettin' the whoIe damn worId to pIay aIong with you.
once you got everybody agreeing with what they know in their hearts ain't true, you've got 'em by the baIIs.
there's what, maybe 500 peopIe in this hospitaI?
I couId pump you fuII of buIIets right now, and I wouIdn't even be arrested.
everyone wouId Iie for me - everyone who counts.
otherwise, aII their own Iies - everything that runs Sin City
it aII comes tumbIing down Iike a pack of cards.
but I want you firm and fit and heaIthy.
I'm even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery.
fix that heart condition of yours.
you're gonna keep on Iiving a Iong time. I'm gonna make sure of that.
you're gonna be convicted of raping that IittIe brat, and shooting my boy.
and you're gonna spend the rest of your Iife in prison, disgraced, destroyed...
aIone.
your wife?
you teII her the truth and she's dead.
you teII anybody the truth and they're dead.
they won't Iet me testify.
I toId the cops that you saved my Iife and they just acted Iike I was crazy.
they taIked my parents into keeping me away.
they said that you'd done things that you didn't do.
I toId them that you saved me from that Roark creep, but they won't even check me out to see that I'm stiII a virgin.
I'm stiII a virgin, stiII aIive - thanks to you.
they got it aII backwards.
sometimes, the truth doesn't matter Iike it ought.
but you'II aIways remember things right.
that's gonna mean a Iot to me.
but stay away, Nancy. They'II kiII you if you don't stay away.
don't visit me.
don't write me.
don't even say my name.
maybe you won't Iet me visit, but I'II stiII write to you, Hartigan.
I'II sign my Ietters " CordeIia. "
that's the name of a reaIIy cooI detective in books I read.
I'II write you every week... for forever.
sure, kid.
now, run on home.
it's not safe for you here.
Bye, Nancy.
I Iove you.
John Hartigan.
Mr. Law and Order.
Mr. By the Book.
Mr. High and Mighty.
I gotta give you credit, being such a straight arrow for so damn many years without it catching up with you.
it's catching up with you now, friend of mine.
it's catching up with you but good.
maybe I oughta Iook at him. He doesn't Iook too good.
Ohh, he's haIe and hearty, Tammy. See?
he's the picture of heaIth.
that Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?
I rented her out of OId Town.
I wanted to show you what you won't be getting any of, not in prison.
you hear me, Hartigan?
if you stop being stupid, start pIaying aIong with us, you might just get some of Tammy.
you see that? She fIinched.
you make her sick.
she heard about you and that IittIe girI.
this is nothing but a price I promised myself I'd pay. and I'm paying it.
you don't save a little girl's life. then turn around and throw her to the dogs.
not in my book. you don't.
they want a confession. They won't get it.
there was a letter from Nancy waiting when they put me in solitary.
she calls herself " Cordelia. " just like she promised.
she makes no mention of anything that would give her away.
at first. I figure she'll send another note or two before her young mind moves on to better things.
but every Thursday. another one arrives.
what a sweet kid.
I do my best to keep my hand from shaking when I reach for it.
she's the only friend I've got - the daughter I never had.
my sweet Cordelia.
skinny little Nancy Callahan.
eight years pass.
then comes a Thursday when I bound from my cot.
excited as a kid at Christmas.
only to find myself staring at the damn floor of my damn cell.
looking for a letter from Nancy that isn't there.
then another Thursday with no letter.
is she all right?
did something happen to her?
nothing.
two months now - not a word from Nancy.
did they find her? Did they get to her?
of course! Stupid old man.
do your math. Nancy's 1 9 years old.
how long did you expect her to keep writing?
she was a saint to keep it up as long as she did.
she's forgotten you. old man.
you're alone.
you're all alone.
this guy smells awful - like bad food.
like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster in the middle of summer.
he stinks so bad. I want to throw up.
practically knocked my head off. the bastard.
when I come to. I see it.
the same kind of envelope Nancy always uses.
but there's no letter inside of it.
there's something soft.
something that ought to be alive - a hunk of meat and bone that ought to be the index finger of the right hand of a 1 9-year-old girl.
how the hell did they find her?
she was so careful.
she never gave away where she lives or where she works.
I've got to get out. I've got to help her.
nothing else matters - not my life and not my pride. either.
it's only one final surrender they want.
you got me. Roark. You beat me.
I'II get it, CIaire. That'II be Marv.
he never sIeeps. He's aIways getting himseIf in deep.
yeah?
what?
Hartigan. My God, it is you.
Yes, yes...
I'II get right on it. Right this second.
I'II be there by ten, I promise.
Lucille. She wouldn't give up on me back before the trial.
she almost slugged me when I stopped her from hiring a new attorney.
when I refused to plead innocent. she did slug me.
if she hears what I'm gonna do. she'll probably slug me again.
Hartigan... Hot damn.
it's Iike they were waiting for my caII.
they're ready to deaI. They're practicaIIy begging for a deaI.
they're scared of something.
one of them as much as promised me paroIe if you confess and express regret and aII that other dumb crap that, of course, we won't go for.
we're getting you out for time served, with no strings attached.
then we're gonna sue those sorry sons of bitches for faIse prosecution.
you're gonna be exonerated, and a very rich man.
this isn't Iike you think it is. - The heII it isn't.
anyone can figure out who framed you, but even Senator Roark isn't God.
you hung up the phone too soon. - We use the Iaw, the press...
he wiII never know what hit him. - I'm gonna confess.
excuse me?
John Hartigan, crawIing on his beIIy in front of a paroIe board?
confessing to raping a IittIe girI and bIubbering for mercy?
no, doesn't work.
I'm going in there teIIing them I'm a twisted, wretched chiId moIester, agreeing to anything they want from me.
aII right, you son of a bitch.
let's get this over with.
I say everything they want to hear. just the way they want to hear it.
I tell them I'm a twisted. wretched child molester.
I agree to everything they want from me.
I love you. Nancy.
it's a Iot of miIes into town, Hartigan.
you care for a ride? - Long as you stay in front of me.
prison's made you paranoid. TaIk about water under the bridge.
Christ.
eight years.
Yeah. Eight years.
weII, if it's any consoIation to you...
you made me hate myseIf.
any word from EiIeen? - Yeah.
well. She got remarried four years ago.
she had two kids. I'm sorry, John.
don't be.
I'm gIad.
EiIeen aIways wanted kids.
she'II make a good mother.
like you said, Bob - water under the bridge.
Bob and I get on with our fond farewells to each other.
then I go looking for the only human being on the planet who means a damn to me
Nancy.
how could they have found out it was you writing all those letters to me?
how did they find out who you are?
and what have they done to you. baby?
not a sound.
no sign of life.
has Roark gone to all this trouble just to torture a broken old man.
like a kid poking at a fly when he's already torn his wings off?
what has he done to Nancy?
it's like all she ever does is read and study and write.
no diary. no phone numbers or addresses written down anywhere.
closest thing to a clue is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon.
it's a long shot. but maybe she's got some friends there.
a dead end.
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do with a pack of drunks and losers like this.
but if there's anything to be found here. the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is or whoever kidnapped her and mutilated her. this is the place.
excuse me, miss. Wondering if you couId heIp me. I'm Iooking for somebody.
coid night Iike this, everybody's Iooking for somebody, stranger.
it's not Iike that. Her name is Nancy.
eyes to the stage, piIgrim.
she's just warming up.
skinny little Nancy Callahan.
she grew up.
she filled out.
Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.
and here I was. expecting a skinny little bookworm.
maybe a bit too shy for her own good.
how little she told me about herself in all her letters for all those years.
how the hell did they find her?
then it hits me.
they were bluffing.
I've led them straight to her.
she hasn't spotted you yet.
turn around and walk out the door.
lead the creep outside.
get that Beretta away from him somehow. and kill him.
I'm just a horny ex-con watching an exotic dancer.
just a few seconds and she'll be safe.
no. Nancy. Don't notice me.
don't recognize me.
there's no time to expIain.
I've made a terribIe mistake, put you in terribIe danger.
we need to get out of here right this second.
whatever you say, Hartigan. Let me throw some cIothes on.
and here I'd figured you'd forgotten aII about me. Me and my dumb Ietters.
kept me going.
kept me from kiIIing myseIf.
hurry up, wiII you?
maybe I shouId drive. - Not a chance.
nobody but me can keep this heap running.
besides, from the sound of things, you might have to shoot somebody.
I don't have a gun. - Under the seat.
it's Ioaded and it works.
Yeah, this'II do.
taken it to the range a coupIe of times. Kicks Iike a muIe.
Hartigan, there's so much I've wanted to say to you.
you've never been far from my thoughts.
I've Iain awake nights, thinking of you.
what are you taIking about?
keep driving, Nancy. Keep driving and keep the car on the road!
she's counting on you. old man.
what are you doing?
prove you're still worth a damn.
try and keep it on the road, Nancy!
he's a decent shot.
he's got skill. but he's in too much of a hurry.
throwing away bullets like they were candy.
he doesn't know how to take his time.
aim careful and look the devil in the eye.
stop the car, Nancy. Gotta confirm the kiII.
what? - Stop the car, now!
right. Stop the car, confirm the kiII.
sorry. I got a IittIe rattIed.
it's OK. You did great. Sit tight. I'II be right back.
No! Let me stay cIose.
nothing can happen to me when I'm with you.
pIease? Let me stay cIose.
the stink - I almost gag.
his blood smells even worse than he does.
Jesus. - And it's all over the place.
but the creep himself. he's gone.
we're out of time.
the sirens - I used to welcome the sound.
there's nothing to do now but find a place to hole up for the night.
get Nancy calmed down. and figure out what on Earth I'm going to do next.
the stink - somehow it stays with us all the way to the motel.
Nancy, I went to your apartment.
your window was thrown wide open. The rooms Iooked aImost empty.
that's why I was sure you'd been kidnapped.
my window? Robbed again? That's the third time this year!
I swore if I ever saw you again, I'd show you I grew up strong.
but there I was, just Iike before, scared and heIpIess.
I'm such an asshoIe. - You shouId sit down.
you'II feeI a IittIe bit better if you sit down.
I've never been all that good with people.
when it comes to reassuring a traumatized 1 9-year-old.
I'm as expert as a palsy victim doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.
it's aIways been you, Hartigan.
aII these years.
it's just nerves making you say that, Nancy.
you're just exhausted. You need to sIeep.
sIeep with me. - Stop it, Nancy!
eight years.
why do you think I kept writing you those Ietters?
it wasn't just gratitude.
I tried to faII in Iove with boys.
even thought I did once or twice.
but I was aIready in Iove... with you.
no.
there's wrong and there's wrong and then there's this.
for God's sakes, you're just a kid!
I Iove you.
I Iove you, too.
with aII my heart.
cold shower - it helps.
no, Nancy.
recognize my voice, Hartigan?
recognize my voice, you piece of shit cop?
I Iook different, but I bet you can recognize my voice.
sure. I recognize your voice, Junior.
everything's gone straight to hell.
I've been suckered into betraying the only friend I've got.
and put her in the hands of a murdering rapist I thought I'd put down for good.
suckered by a spoiled brat son of a senator.
it's all gone to hell.
KIump, it's me.
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.
I want you to set me up for a party.
I've aIready got the girI, you dumb shit!
Hey, it better be perfect or I'm caIIing my dad!
my tooIs better be cIean and sharp.
it better be ready! It better be perfect!
I get to do whatever I want, however I want, whenever I want it!
my dad - I'd Iove him if I didn't hate him.
he spent a fortune hiring every expert on the pIanet to grow back that equipment you bIew off from between my Iegs, just so the oId fart can hoId out some kind of hope of having a grandkid.
AIthough, as you can see, there were some side effects.
I'm not compIaining, though. Since you've been gone,
I've been having the time of my Iife.
and now you've Ied me back to your darIing CordeIia.
we aII wondered who wrote aII those Ietters.
she Ieft not a cIue.
cIever girI. And so pretty, so pretty.
a IittIe oId for my taste, but I can forgive that just this once.
Nancy, don't scream.
whatever he does to you, don't scream.
she'II scream. I'm gonna take aII night doing dear oId Nancy.
and you're gonna die knowing that it's aII your fauIt.
they've aII screamed, Hartigan.
dozens of them - maybe a hundred.
eight years' worth. Every one of them has screamed.
and if there weren't so many peopIe hereabout,
I wouId show you how I'm gonna make dear oId Nancy scream.
it's gonna be one heII of a show!
this is it. No way to fight it now.
no hope left.
no chance.
this is it. This is the end.
no.
give it a shot. old man. Keep your neck tight. Move.
the window - maybe there's an alarm. The window.
keep your neck tight. goddamn it! Stay conscious!
stay conscious.
no alarm.
the glass! Cut the rope.
you can do it. You can do it.
it is incIement upon me to comment with marked dispIeasure on your rash impuIsiveness in seIecting such an eye-catching and impracticaI car to heist, Mr. ShIubb.
protest though you might, Mr. KIump, you must nonetheIess admit the phaIIic magistry of said Ferrari's performance.
an engine of CycIopean power throbs beneath this steeI staIIion's hood.
IrreIevant to said mission is the foIIowing query, which I now put forth to you.
wherein this most streamIined and trunkIess of transports
boner-inspiring though it may be
wherein are we to reposit our recentIy deceased cargo?
a worthy concern.
NeatIy eIucidated.
I can onIy express puzzIement that borders on aIarm.
teII me where Roark takes the girIs or I'II cut your damn head off!
in pIain EngIish, creep!
the answer you seek is ruraI, even agrarian.
the farm!
that's all I need to hear. Every cop on the force knows about the Roark family's farm and to stay away from it.
Shlubb and Klump were packing an arsenal.
once things get loud. I'll probably have use for the cannons.
but at first. I'll have to play it quiet.
quiet and nasty.
Nancy's car - six miles from the farm.
'nobody but me can keep this heap running. " she told me.
good girl. The car stalled out on that yellow bastard and you didn't tell him how to start it up again.
you kept your mouth shut. I'll bet Junior was furious.
I'll bet he slapped you around something fierce.
but you stayed strong. You bought a few extra minutes.
there's still a chance. Nancy.
don't scream.
I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm and make my way through the woods.
I'm not halfway there when it hits.
my heart. Can't be my heart.
I was cured.
bad cough - blood in it.
doesn't matter now.
I don't have to stay alive that much longer. anyway.
rotten way to kill a man. but it's quiet.
hate yourself later.
you're onIy making this worse for yourseIf, you stupid cow!
do you think I'm tired?
is that it? Do you think I'm getting tired?
you're the one who's gonna crack!
you'II crack!

and maybe after I've pulled off that miracle. I'll go and punch out God.
there isn't a prosecutor in the state who'll go after Senator Roark.
I killed his only son.
the bloodline is cut.
roark's lost his goddamn legacy.
he'll use all his power to get revenge on me.
he'll go after me through Nancy. He'll find her again.
there'll be no end to it.
she'll never be safe.
not as long as I'm alive.
there's only one way to beat him.
an old man dies.
a young woman lives.

Yeah, sorry. It's just there was a...

no.
no, of course not! And why? Why didn't he fail it?
he doesn't do history.

Drama...Right. Drama. Home. Coursework.

what do you think? Which skirt? This goes with my slutty green top.
this one is more virgin.
Tony? Which skirt?
Oh, yeah, it's nice.

Yeah, er, come in!

Yeah.
that's better. Is that a picture of my girlfriend?
wondered where that went.
right then.
Russia... Lech Walesa...
Jesus, Sid.
the USSR model could be describedas a relationship of control and manipulation, but events in the G...
Gdansk.
...shipyard in the autumn of 1980was the beginning of a...
that's some really good bullshit.
not a problem. OK, let's go.
where to?
my choir concert.
don't tell me you forgot.
I can't. I'm grounded.
don't be such a fucking vagina. This is gonna be special.
anyway, I need someone to keep Michelle company.
Michelle's coming?
Oh, yes. Nips'll be there.
and you'll wanna see this. Trust me.
sorry about that. You won't tell her, will you?
she thinks the world of you, Sid. Really.
and things run their course. You get bored.
are you gonna tell me what you're talking about?
you'd better be doing some fucking work. Hi, Tony. How's things?
not bad, Mark. Is that landfill survey finished? I'd really love to see it sometime.
Yeah, no problem. Yeah.
actually, it's quite an interestinganalysis of decomposition rates.
but look, actually, er, Sid's got some work to do now, so...
OK. Hope to see you very soon, Sid.
nice to see you, Mark.
Bye, Liz! Bye, Tony!

Oh，Mega Dog to the rescue! Attack, attack! Woof-woof!
I'm not being aggressive...
Yes, you are.
you're the aggressive one.
look at you, the Virgin Marywith your fucking little looks and sneers.
but that's you. Never saying anything.
leaving it to me to deal with Captain fucking Calamity up there.
never backing me up.
that's not true.
the boy's useless, completely fucking useless.
I sometimes wonder if he's even mine.
Oh, he's yours all right, Mark.
mega Dog's trying to tell us something!
woof, woof, woof! Woof, woof!
Hi, Sid. We're just talking.
right. Talking, yeah.

you see what you've done now?
what I've done? Yes, what you've done.
you stupid, stupid man.
what do you mean, stupid? Don't call me stupid.
I am not a stupid man. If you wouldlisten for a second to what's...
what are you doing here, anyway?
well, I heard "choirgirls" so I came.
shall we?
I said if they can't fucking educate her, then I'll take my business elsewhere.
four fucking grand a termand the girl gets three GCSEs?
that's the return on my investment?
Where's my margin? What do they think we are?
fucking stupid or something...
Where's Tony?
I don't know. Fuck! We'd better be at the right concert.
no, it's definitely here.
you never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knowswhat I'd be without you...
beach Boys, man. Fucking top!
I don't understand this. Where is he?

God, you're such a wanker.

fuck you.
fluffy teddy-bear?
that's my lucky teddy!
and you can fuck off, too!
well... Michelle. I'm just wonderingwhy you're overreacting like this.
overreacting?!
right in my face, you whore!
you know, typically, episodes of paranoia might be symptomatic of a wide rangeof emotional and mental issues.
maybe, you know, you needsome help with the outbursts.
my mother's a psychologist, she could...
Ow! I'll kill you, you fucking flat-chested cocksucking spastic horse-fucker!
woah, good swearing.
Bye, Tony.
later, Nips.
ABI, wonder if you could give me and Sid a minute.
yes... I need my medication.
see, told you it'd be worth coming for.
looks like me and Chelle are on a break.
you did that on purpose?
go after her. What?
life throws up so few opportunities...
but she's your girlfriend.
who you love. What?
change. It's a wonderful thing.
look, you know how subatomic particlesdon't obey physical laws?
they act according to chance, chaos, coincidence...
they run into each other in the middle ofthe universe, and, bang! Energy.
we're the same as that.
that's the great thingabout the universe. Unpredictable.
that's why it's so much fun.
I'm... just gonna go seeif she's OK, all right?
Sid. Bang!
Michelle would never...never fuck a horse.
OK, so this line here meansyou're gonna live till you're at least 80, and this line here, that means you should be careful aroundelectricity pylons and crocodiles...
Cwocodiles?! That's right.
all right, daarlin! A bad night?
piss off.
what's your problem? You giving us cheek?
no. She so is.
Hey, Ems, this girl is being rudeto Char and Shall...
she's giving us cheek. Yeah?
fuck off out of my way.
you givin' them cheek?
Cheek...She so is.

you and your fucking bum chum!
no, I really didn't! Fuck off!
you gave me cheek.
sorry...
sorry don't work. You gave her cheek.
did I?
I'm pretty sure I didn't.
my mate... she gave you cheek.
you give us cheek, too.

is there any possible wayI could avoid a kicking?
you could try talking your way out of it.
mega Dog to the rescue!

Thanks, Mum.
Sid, hang on. Close the door.

Sid, there are people here you can talk to.
I am here for you.
we can sort this out.
I'm all ears. Come on.
what? We can sort out the fact that my best mate wants me to make a moveon his girlfriend, who I love, even though she still loves himand now actually hates me?
my Dad thinks I'm a complete fuck-up, and can't stop acting like a fuck-up and no matter what I try, I can't stop pissing everyone off?
we can sort that out, can we?
OK. OK, yeah.
give me a moment to, um...

ring her. Take her for a drink, and see what happens.
what's the worst that can happen? It's your choice, dude. Your choice.
Ah, fuck.

JAL, wait? Where are you going?

shit!
is she all right? -She will be.
what have they done to her?
pumped her stomach. -What?!
why have you choseto start caring about her now?
it's a bit fucking late. You're the last person she needs right now.
Why? Why is this my fault?

hang on. Have you split up?
Oh, God, no, no.
so she's just not living here or talking to you any more?
Yeah.
right.
she said to tell you "sorry."
why is she sorry? Isn't her fault, is it?
relationships are complicated...and sometimes, you know...
you shouldn't blame yourself.
I don't blame myself. I blame you.
I know, and, you know, you have...
shut up! Why did you let her go?!
Sid... I can't...
because you're fucking useless, you sodding idiot!
you stupid bastard. You fucking stupid bastard!
that's my fucking mum! And she's fucking gone!
Sid, I'm so sorry...It's a bit late for that.
you've got to ring her.
it won't do any good. -Ring her! Or... Or...
you're fucking groundeduntil you get her back!

time's movin' on...
it'll be OK.
Hey, Sid. Where'd you get to?
Sid, hello?

Ah, we're here.
best pub in the west.
hello boys.
all right, Christina.
ay, ay lads, here's the birthday boy.
did you do all this?
took me a long time, a good forty, forty five minutes.
you all right?
touch of pain in the privates, it's the old whore wound.
nothing I can't handle.
Oh, these are me boys, Freddie, JJ.
boys, this is UncleKeith.
Hi，Hello.
pull my finger!
you dirty old bugger!
if you'd be so kind, Christina?
right you are, big boy.
and when I woke up, the pool was three feet deep in piss.
mum, I shouted, don't jump in! But it was too late.
so, you and the Buxton Rovers under 21s managed to do that in one night?
just me, the lads, and a shit load of all-inclusive mild.
and they never pinned it on me.
Plus, you got to remember, this was 1962.
I mean, Pontin's was a fairly permissive place back then.
bit like Afghanistan in the '70s.
but with the Krankies and slightly more Taliban.
tell that one where you hit Bob Dylan over the head with a box of fish fingers.
another time. I've gotta go and see a man about a dog.
a dog filled with drugs.
see you boys. Oh, happy birthday, Cookie.
that, my friends, is what you call a legend.
to who, exactly?
what?
who is he a legend to?
me.
blokes in pubs. Christina.
people.
I think the guy's crazy.
exactly man. Exactly.
same again please, Christina.
look, man. Look at that. Quality totty. That's top shelf shit.
guys, guys, hey baby...
I'm so happy to introduce you to my legendary night out in celebration of my birthday.
apart from you.
but I...
what are you doing here! You burnt my house, man! Get out!
it was an accident. I'm sorry...
what the fuck!
I'm 17 today, so all bets are off.
do what the fuck you like.
flush your mates down the toilet. Eat grapes off each other.
smash speakers over your heads.
if partying's a crime, who's gonna get arrested first?
let's go fucking mental!
party people!
for he's a jolly good fellow.For he's a jolly good fellow.For he's a jolly good fellow.And so say all of us.

her mate Kayleigh's getting hitched.
so it'll be free bar, free entry, that kind of thing?
Yeah, I suppose, why?
no.
no, no, no, no, no. No way!
why not?
cos my sister's there, and I don't want to see her.
Plus, she doesn't like you very much.
why not? I'm always touching her and flirting with her.
Yeah.
her tits stand to attention when I'm around. I've seen it.

now can you let me in?
not coming in.
listen, fate has brought me here.
do you understand? You're not letting fate in the club.
it's not like fate is wearing trainers.
fate just wants a couple of drinks, a little dance.
and fate is actually also desperate for the toilet.
now can we come in?
how about you fuck off?
how about you're a fucking cock?
I'll fucking break your fucking face, mate!
what?
I said I'll fucking break your fucking face.
you'll get your fucking head kicked in here!

I don't think he's going to let us in.
Nah, he's just an obstacle.
we're meant to go this party.
Fate'll sort it. Just wait.
brilliant. Idiot. He's such a fucking tosser.
Freddie?! What the fuck are you doing here?
Hi, Karen.
you can't come in. It's private.
it's Cook's birthday.
unless you've got drugs, fuck off, and take your friends with you.
Oh, come on Karen.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Yeah. Look, it's not my decision. It's her party.
I'm getting married.
Congratulations.
Jesus.
will you let us in?
well, there is a pretty strict dress code.
how strict exactly?
let's cock and roll, baby!
isn't it lush? Daddy says nothing's too good for me.
you got that right, babe. So, who you marrying?
Oh, just some guy. He's a bit of a twat.
Ah, cheers, man.
when she said "party..."
you thought she meant an acid-fuelled sex rave without the Mancunians.
this is more...
jelly and ice cream.
uhh, get it down you, girls.
top freebies, yeah? Love it.
I hate champagne.
then why you fucking drinking it, then?
it's free.
dad!
Kaleigh-kins.
Hi! This is Cookie...
finish your drink, kid.
have as much as you like.
nothing's too good for my Kayleigh... Right?
right
and I wouldn't want anything to ruin the evening...
drop the tone...
anything at all.
OK?
right you are.
enjoy.
Kayleigh. You're almost a woman...
Thanks, Daddy.
almost.
see you around, Cookie.
you twat didn't you know him
fuck it, man. I'm just getting started.
what's the fuss?
he's Johnny White. The gangster.
Yeah. Legend.
he murdered those two nuns over a pint of Guinness.
allegedly.
I hear he stabbed a policeman in the neck with a stuffed guillemot.
that's so not true. It was a puffin.
so. Who's for narcotics?
me.
me.
me.
me?
what?
I've decided I love drugs.
rum punch.
what is it?
uncle Keith's special blend.
a hallucinogenic opiate and stimulant.
four hours of THC giggles and MDMA highs with a transcendental kicker.
sounds good.
well, come on, then. Jesus.
all in good time, babes. Weird girl?
yeah? Hold that.
fuck's sakes, are we getting any or what?!
no, no, no. Wait!
hang on, what you doing?
what?
was that wrong?
did you just swallow my drugs?
she's fucking finished it!
it tastes horrible!
you're not supposed to eat it!
it goes up the nose, you twat.
let's go fly a kite, girl!
what about us?
well, you can drink some of the weird girl's blood, she's like a walking syringe.
my mouth's gone all numb.
I'm not surprised!
we've done ours, let's go!
come on Panders, we're out of here.
I said you shouldn't have let them in.
Where's the love?
you're a wanker, James.
you will get us some more, won't you, Cookie?
Yeah.
cos if you could, that would be - God
really, really great.
I need more class A drugs, quick.
Why?
cos that Kayleigh girl just gave me the look.
what sort of look is that?
this one.
right. I see what you mean.
Freddie, we've got to get this man some drugs.
Why? Do the look.
what does that mean?
it means I'm getting laid tonight, Fred.
please, not Kayleigh. Think of me and JJ.
you're not fucking her.
I thought you liked Effy.
Yeah, she's a peach. But I already tapped that. Top-dollar shag.
she's my last resort. Sure thing, I reckon.
you shagged Effy?
Oh, come on, Freds.
when?
first day I met her.
why didn't you tell us?
because apart from those times when my cock is up your arse, you have no reason to worry about where it is the rest of the time.
but...
JJ likes her.
I was going to ask her out.
I mean, she seemed like she liked me.
you snooze, you lose, dude.
anyway, I've got a snake in my dick that's about to throw up.
Naomi. Wait!
what?
where are you going?
home.
don't go.
why not?
I dunno. Because...
why does your sister think I'm gay?
sorry.
see you around, Emily.
thank you. Yes, please.
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
the father of the bride,
mr Johnny White.
so. My daughter's getting married and she couldn't have chosen a nicer bloke - Steve Heston.
unfortunately, Steve couldn't attend today without violating the terms of his probation.
he couldn't be here himself, but he is well represented by members of his family.
welcome, Hestons. No more rucks.
no more knives. No more pliers.
we're gonna be tight as a badger's bum.
the Whites and the Hestons brought together in the marriage bed, still fucking each other, but in a good way.
come up here, sweetheart.
you've kept yourself pure for so long for this task of peace.
in times of strife, you've lit up my life, and now you're gonna be Steve's wife.
and I just want to say...
don't she look a picture?
I could just eat her.
right, charge your glasses with free booze, and raise 'em.
kayleigh and Steve.
kayleigh and Steve.
pandora, wake up, you dozy cow.
Hi. It's me.
I need a favour.
uncle Keith!

Cheers.
not a problem.
there you go.
direct from Weston-super-Mare.
you're a lifesaver, Keith.
gotta go, Cook. Gotta see a dog about a bone.
a bone that is my cock.
get it out, then.
OK.
not that. The drugs, idiot.
Oh, OK.
thank you.
is that all you're doing?
Yep.
that was a hamster-sized bump. Don't you want any more?
no.
OK.
so...
so.
OK, I'll see you later!
what? I thought we were gonna bone.
and what made you think that?
you've had the drugs and you gave me the look.
what look? This one.
what the fuck is that
that's the "I'll fuck for drugs" look.
now stop arguing and get on my cock. What? No.
blow me, then. My dick is clean.
I don't care! Hand-job?
no
but you've got to let me have a go on your tits while you're doing it
listen...
if anyone's going to get a lick of my fanny, they'll have to impress me.
So...if you do...
I'll let you stick it anywhere.
my tits, my arse, my armpit...
anywhere.
you're filthy.
Yes, I am.
and look, no knickers. Whoops. See ya!

you're drinking yourself to death, you're fighting gangsters.
I don't even want to know what happened last night.

welcome to our fortress of solitude!
I think I love the Sexxbombz.
Karen's costume last night was a bit of a marvel.
I'm pretty sure it defied the laws of physics.
I mean, that tiny amount of material is surely not be able to cover the requisite surface area for UK broadcasting laws.
did you see it, Eff?
no...
that skirt was so short I saw her bumhole wink.
pass the spliff, Freddiebrek.
possiblely a trick Don't worry, I've perfected it.

after all this excitement, I fancy a spunk.
you coming, Eff? You soon will be.
I'd sooner fuck JJ.
I know that isn't intended as a compliment.
but I'm going to take it as one anyway.
maybe you didn't get it.
I said,'Are you coming, Eff? You soon will be.'
I got it.
freddie and JJ got it. That termite over there got it.
but you're not going to get it. Got it?
no... I'm confused.
I'm not going anywhere near your crayola dick.
I know where it's been.
what's she talking about?
piss off then.
this is our place, right?
if you're not going to shag us, then get to fuck.
mate, try and stir my porridge if you want but I'd say even Jay's got a better chance than you.
I mean, when was the last time you breathed fire?
Freddie!
Freddie... Dinner's ready!
so, should I be called Minxy Sexxbomb or Foxy Sexxbomb?
jordan says he likes Minxy. I wanted it to be Sexy Sexxbomb...

we want you here at two o'clock tomorrow.
what for?
filming for the interview before my final performance.
you've got to talk about how much you miss Mum and how much it'll mean to you to see me win.
Wow! This is like, too fucked-up for words.
my Mum's dead, vote for me...
it's not like it's not true. I miss Mum every day.
shit... Dad, she's doing it again!
you need a story, everyone knows that.
see!
she didn't mean it like that.
Yes, I did. At least I've got some fucking ambition!
I don't really think wanting Robbie Williams to jizz over your baps doesn't count as ambition!
Oh, that's nice. That's lovely guy!
Freddie, be here tomorrow at two o'clock.
you know what, Why should I?
cos I wash your clothes, cook your meals, put a roof over your head, probably pay for your skunk and I do it all without asking anything in return.
except this.
look! Look at her!
she's your sister, you support her. That's it.
it's just...
fucking hell...
you know?
it's just, like, erm...Fucking hell, you know?
dad!
Freddie! You get back here and apologise.
Freddie, get back here!
dad, get him back here now and make him apologise to me! Sorry.
dad, you've got to get him back here. Dad, please...
I am The only one Can ride that horse Yonder I'm full of beans Who died at sea...
so. Hamlet. What's it all about...
...dudes?
anyone?
well, Josie, through the fog of his grief,
hamlet is struggling to choose between action or inaction, and through this struggle, he encounters existential forces illuminating the path towards death which is, in itself, life.
my my, that is an illuminating thesis, Gerald. Well, done.
well, thank you. No, thank you.
you're a delight to teach. Oh, thank you
I got held up.
Freddie's always late.
sorry...
sit down, please.
is Freddie gonna fail his A-levels?
I'm afraid so, Gerald.
you're all gonna fail if you don't read the pucking book...
I've read it! It was great!
Oh!
I didn't really understand it though.
Oh.
did the ghost do it after all, or was it Voldemort?
he's a right beast, in't he?
erm, I think you got your books mixed up again, Panda.
so! In summary, the predominant themes of William Shakespeare's Hamlet are...
action, inaction, madness, grief, death...
being, or not being. That is the question...
uh... Anyone else?
hamlet's basically a teenage boy.
he's got these desires but he doesn't have the bottle to reach for them.
so he goes mad and wanks off about Ophelia and ends up so boring that somebody has to kill him.
I'm not sure that's right.
there's no wanking in Hamlet.
Mmm. Yeah. There is. Loads. Only they call it soliloquizing.
nice one, blondie. She's funny.
Cook...Cook...No, please don't!
stop it...Stop it, please!
Freds!
Oh, thanks a lot, Cook. Now my nipples are really chafed.
come on. We're going down the boozer.
Nah...I'm gonna... Come on!
I need to get that fucking Dickens out me head.
let's get fucking trashed!
but... Oh, come on, Freddie.
it's been ages since we last went out.
no.
I'm going home.
Oh, no...No...Please don't! Not again!
have a tickle! Have a tickle!
so, Freddie...
tell us what it means to you to have Karen in the grand final of Search For A Sexxbomb?
it's like, you know...well, I mean...
I can't quite put it into words.
it's great.
it is great.
he is just the best brother in the whole wide world.
we take every day as a blessing from God, because, you know, Mum isn't with us any more.
it really makes you think.
does it? About what?
about, you know...Life is precious and stuff.
Freddie, why don't you tell me what it was like to lose your mother?
I didn't lose her.
I'm not going to find her down the back of the sofa.
OK, But, you know, like, how did it feel?
Oh, it felt great, Jordan. It felt really great.
let me ask you...
how does it feel being a cocaine-snorting, low-budget, corporate puppet?
Yeah, ok...I think we're going to cut here.
mum was...
she was the one who told me that I had a talent, a gift.
who first sang with me and believed in me.
when I'm singing out there, I'm not just singing for me.
I'm singing for her.
and I'm singing for anyone who's ever been through tragedy.
OK, cut there. I love you, Karen! I actually love you. Wow!
yeah?
Yeah...You're so warm and sweet and cool.
I could eat you. I'd love to eat you.
you'd like that, wouldn't you, Karen?
I'd love that, Jordan.
OK, all right...
listen, I need a chai latte. Where's that asshole runner?
in there, with the other arseholes.
you know, you're not that hot kid. Nobody wants to eat you...
Phil yes, my man... You're such a cock.
why are you trying to fuck this up for me?
I want the stuff that makes me go gaga, you know?
start raping people, you know? You are beautiful.
I'll see you then.
you know. You oughta get laid or something, kid.
I might be a corporate puppet or whatever but I have a fucking good time.
how's being an angsty little prick working out for you?
Wow. I haven't seen you dressed like that since, well...ever.
you look a bit like Frau Hilde from Primary.
right now Kinder, get ze glitter on ze macaroni und stick!
stick! Express yourselves, ja?
Oh, oh, Jeremiah. No.
Oh, no. Ze glue is all over das lippen.
do you remember how Cook used to try and ping his crayons into her bra?
Yeah.
primary was fun.
Yeah...yeah it was.
cook wants you to come to Uncle Keith's pub quiz tomorrow.
Oh, well...
if Cook wants me there, I suppose I'd better fucking hop to it!
Freddie... Why don't you want to be friends with us any more?
cook hasn't got any friends. Just...people that he knows.
don't say that. JJ!
so? I mean...
what else are you gonna do?
anyway...
you'll like this.
hang on, pack of cards...
.handkerchief, and a mouse, but I haven't actually got a mouse, so...
so, a rubber. I need you to pick a card...
I'll pick it for you.
Hello, Effy. I hope you're OK.
good.
now, Elizabeth. It's important for you to remember that your mother and I still love each other very much.
no we don't.
no. That's right. We don't.
and that's why you're leaving.
that's why I'm leaving.
that's why I'm fucking out of here, woman.
I am on a fucking plane.
you're dead right. I am fucking out of here...
what's up?
.and you've got so little imagination, you have to shag my fucking boss!
it's pathetic. You could have shagged the turd from Tesco's.
take anything!
I don't want anything!
take it! Otherwise it's all going to cunting Oxfam!
don't you dare use 'cunt' and 'Oxfam' in the same sentence!
take something. You bought it with your fucking precious money.
all right. I'll take my fucking pan.
take that pan and you are fucking dead!
I brought your bracelet back.
Thanks.
we'd be good together.
don't you think?
no.
Why?
because I'll break your heart.
maybe I'll break yours.
nobody breaks my heart...
and anyway, why would I want that?
who the buggering tits is this?
unbelievable.
they're not actually crazy, you know.
they're just women.
now that I know The way it goes You gotta pay back every penny that you owe Twelve years old In your momma's clothes Shut the blinds and lock up every blow And if you hear Someone's coming near Just close your eyes and make them disappear...
it's amazing what you can accomplish if you get up early.
fuck!
don't swear. You know I don't like you swearing...
this is bullshit!
this is our fucking shed.
mine and JJ's and Cook's. Since we were little kids.
maybe it's time you grew up then.
besides, Karen needs somewhere to rehearse...
and actually it's my shed.
I think this is the worst thing anyone's ever done to me.
I didn't do to you.
I did it for you.
right. Question 23...
a swan is the only bird with a penis, but how long can a cockroach live after you've pulled its head off?
easy.
Ah, this is the life, eh? The three musketeers out on the lash.
let's have a cheers.

who does your sister think she is? Gina fucking G?
this shed situation is fucked.
the Cookie Monster does not like this.
if you find her so reprehensible, why did you have sex with her?
oooh wait, wait. That was supposed to stay in the vault. Wasn't it?
JJ? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm emotionally underdeveloped.
you shagged my sister?
you know what I'm like, Freds...
half a bottle of grappa and I turn into a fucking machine gun.
I can't... You fucked my sister?!
just be, Freddie.
just be.
fuck!
bring it, Karen, bring it.
what do you want?
I was just wondering if there was anything else you wanted to take
what?
you've got this...
maybe you want my bedroom for a tanning salon next.
at least then you might stand a chance tomorrow.
Freddie...
just let me rehearse, and you can bitch at me after the final.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I forgot that's the only thing that matters in the whole world.
grow the fuck up.
you don't see it, do you?
you don't see what a stupid fucking cliche you really are.

I bet he fucked you good, didn't he?
I know your type, Karen.

Freddie, every time I look at you, I wonder...
you've got your mother's eyes, but...
.I don't know who you are any more.
you just skate around.

Sam!
Hiya, love.

the new concept in fitness that gives you a full body work-out in just five minutes!

Where's that bolt go?
what? oh, shit!
Agh! James!
things are cool, aren't they, Mum?
between you and Dad?
of course, Katiekins! Nothing for you to worry about.
how unreal do I look?
amazingly unreal.
Dean is going to come in his pants when he sees me.
brandy!
baby!
you look unreal.
I'm sorry I'm late. My colonic overran.
Jenna, have you talked to oK! about covering the wedding?
unfortunately, Vivienne, they insisted they only cover premiership do's.
excuse me?
I mean, negotiations are still ongoing.
wonderful.
now, we also want a gaggle of swans, 100 doves and a trained owl.
an owl?
to bear the ring.
these will be expensive extras.
Jenna, I promised Brandy the wedding of her dreams...
and that is what she'll have.
I'm sure you'd want the same for Katie.
look, I'll sort out the hen night and you just deal with the owls and stuff, oK?
daughters, eh? What would we do without them?
don't know!
see you tonight, and don't forget the theme, sluts and studs.
sluts and studs.
well, come on then.
that's you.
now, Katherine, your home tests were coming up correct, you're not pregnant.
thank God!
what's up with my periods then?
your results show that you're going through something called...
a premature menopause.
Oh, right.
shit!
I can't imagine what you're feeling.
not being able to have children
well, it isn't a nice thought, is it?
especially at your age.
what are you talking about?
Katherine, the menopause prevents you from ovulating.
which means you won't be able to conceive babies.
what? Ever?
but there's pills for that, right?
I'm afraid not.
I know this is a lot to take in.
would you like me to call your mum?
well?
have I got you knocked up?
thank fuck! That would totally not be awesome.
woo-hoo!
hoo-hoo!
you can pretty much fuck off now.
what's with the mood, sugar titties?
leave me alone.
Kitty Kat, stop kidding round.
do I look like I'm kidding? You're dumped.
fuck off.
broke my fucking toe.
goodbye, Sam.
Katie!
Hi, this is Emily.
can't come to the phone right now but leave me a message.
bitch!
you're in the wrong account.
no, sweetheart, I can assure you... Mum.
the Fitch Fitness account has been empty...'
this has nothing to do with Fitch Fitness.
I use our family account and we are not bankrupt.
I'm sorry about this, give me a moment to look into it.
do you know your password?
look, you know, I don't have time for this.
I'm trying to run a business here.
so why don't you just get it on your stupid screen and sort it out?
it says here you've been informed on numerous occasions.
have you had any letters? No, we haven't received notification.
no nothing, zilch.
Mrs Fitch, you are not eligible for any more loans and you've exceeded your overdraft limit.
arsehole!
are you referring to me? No, not you.
Hello?
mum?
what are those?
deep breaths, Jenna.
deep breaths.
mum?
honey, we're home!
mum? Mum?
babe, we're back.
mum!
the nurse said that I have an unusual fascination for the female anatomy and that I should consider a career as a gyna...
gyna...

what's the word, Dad?
gynaecologist.
something you want to tell me, Rob?
don't you dare run away from me, don't you dare!
you stupid, stupid person.
you bastard, you're a fucking coward.
I was going to tell you.

you fucking bastard! Stupid, stupid
what's happening?
you'll be all right.
everything's going to be fine.

myself.
don't you dare make out like I'm the one in the wrong.
just calm down, love.
I'm gonna burn your "Gym of the Year" certificate.
what? What's going on, Mum?

another shot, Brands? WTF, Cands.
here we go, a toast to my new boyfriend, Danny Guillermo.
to husbands, handbags and holidays!
Danny's told me about you.
I figured you'd have bigger tits.
they're like Danny's favourite thing ever.
he never complained. Not to your face.
so, you got a new man now then?
brandy, Baby, I am paying Katie to work, not to socialise.
sorry, Mum.

my darling daughter has been blessed with her looks and what God didn't give her, my plastic surgeon did!
brandy, sweetheart, beautiful...
I am so proud of you.
you've grown up to be a sexy, arousing woman.
and what with the wedding, and now the baby, you've just exceeded all my expectations.

to Brandylicious!
Brandylicious!

I'm so angry Mummy told everyone I got knocked up.
Yeah, I bet.
Oh, I'll have some of that.

don't care, and I don't think you can talk to me like that.
I'll do what I want.
you're in my way. Move.
Katie!
what are you doing here?
you cool?

is that a joke?
Katie, I'm... You haven't changed.
I can see straight through you.
likewise.
never going to let that smile falter?
only when yours does.
sweetheart, I've run out of fags.
you'll need to run along and go and get some more.
one, I'm not your fucking maid.

stupid bitch.
rudeness!

nothing's ever perfect, you know?
I thought it could be.
I wanted the perfect boyfriend, perfect marriage, perfect everything.
what's changed?
me.
I don't know who I am any more.
I thought you were Katie fucking Fitch!
people Keep on learning Soldiers Keep on warring Cos my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then Gonna keep on trying Till I reach the highest ground.
I used to hide in the bath when she was angry.
I've really messed up, kiddo.
Yeah, but you love each other, right?

kids...
it seems that your father has let us down once again.
Jen, please.
he's been selfish and stupid.
mum, stop it. I suggest you keep shtoom, young lady, considering you've lost us the only income we had.
because of his stupidity, this house...
our home, is being taken from us.
today.
tell your children what that means, Rob.
it means we're homeless.
that's right, it means we're homeless because of your dad.
I tried to save the gym.
it's these loan companies, nice as pie one minute, next thing they're calling you up, sending you letters, but you gotta believe me, we're going to make a fortune out of that machine.
that machine's a total waste of space, Rob, just like you.
take James upstairs.

how could you do this to us? To your own children?
your own children? I'm trying to do the best I can.

come on, open up, you lot. Come on, this is getting stupid now.
right, fuck this, we're going in.
Hello?
tell you what... I think it's happened again.
Oh, bugger!
Oh, well.
fuck it, can't think of everything.
Oh look! They've got one of them there glass swans.
where to?
my mum used to have one of those. Oh, yeah!
this is a beauty. It's really heavy.
perfectly sculptured. look at this, bud.
you see, it's the weight of the lead that they put in the crystal, see?
Oh, feel the quality of him.
Oh, yeah, I see where you're coming from, Kev.
might take this home for my Carol.
I promised Phil some new saucepans.
and a toaster.
you get a better quality of toaster up at this estate.
well, you know what they're like round here all fur coat and no knickers.
nouveau reech, in't it?
mind you, I wouldn't have done it out like this, would you?
I don't like that paint job at all.
magnolia and lime? Bollocks!
time? All that time when those fucking bills were coming in and you did nothing about it!
how long was that? Cos when I looked at them
I'd say there was a good six, seven months' worth!
it takes time to sort out - you wouldn't let me deal with it!
I know you're not the sharpest tool in the box...
we're not going to sort it out here. Get in the car!
I hate KFC.
what?
Elliot Evans's parents got divorced and his dad spent every night in KFC.
then he met this woman and she had a huge problem, so he tried to help her, and her friend got really angry and he ended up with only one kneecap.
and now his mum's doing pornos and his dad's a junkie and he never sees them.
except on the internet, and then he has to pay for it!
I mean, how unfair is that?
I never thought you'd fail as a father!
I haven't failed as a father!
you've let your kids down! They're in the car, all that time when those fucking bills were coming in...
you do nothing about it
how long was that? Cos when I looked...
I'm so fed up! I can't go on like this, Rob.
I swear to God, I've had it up to here with you.
drop me and the kids at the airport. I'm going to my mum's.
No!
get back in the car, Katie.
mum, we can't afford the flights to Malaga. We're broke!
you want to sleep with your dad on the streets?
it won't come to that!
well, where else are we going to stay?!
fix it, Rob.
or I'm getting in the car and I am leaving with the children.
there is someone we can stay with.
who?
good morning, Naomi.
you're looking sexy.
you heard of a shower?
what do you want?
this is difficult, OK? But we've lost our house.
Oh, that was careless.
so what?
we need somewhere to stay.
your house is pretty empty at the moment.
you're having a fucking laugh.
Yes, Naomi, I'm kidding that my parents have no money, no house and are about to split up.
I'm sorry, but...
it's not my problem.
Oh, but it is. Cos it's Emily's problem.
she's your girlfriend. That makes it your problem.
no lesbian digs?
that, I can't promise.
I'm gonna sort this.
I'll be back later.
running away again?
he's gone to look for somewhere to live, actually.
I'm not going in there.
please, Mum.
you've got nowhere else to go.
please?
we've run out of cereals.
garibaldi?
thank you.
look at her, swanning about as if she's done nothing wrong.
she hasn't.
I want the best for Emily, and she isn't.
how do you know?
mums know these things. You'll realise that one day.
are you really going to leave Dad?
when your dad and I got married, we had nothing.
we spent years working and saving, so that you kids could have the best of everything. And for what?
it's all gone.
I never thought we'd split up.
but then I never thought I'd be evicted from my home or that my daughter would be a...
.so rebellious.
people always let you down, princess.
they fuck things up.
not you, though.
mum, I need to tell you something.
I know everything's going wrong at the moment but...it's just...
.I went to the doctor's the other day, and...
fuck's sake.
you could have called.
you've been out all night.
I know.
can you blame me? And now they're here.
we've got enough problems.
stop it, Em.
all the shit she put us through, you let her march into our home.
she's your mum.
she's a selfish cow, is what she is.
Emily?
whatever! Stay here.
don't expect me to care, cos I don't.
it's just for a couple of days while we get ourselves out of this pickle.
stay out of my way.
this is my house. I live here with my girlfriend.
and we're having a barbecue.
all right?
whatever you say, love.
I'm going to finish emptying the car.
I am the only one that Thinks I'm going crazy And I don't know what to do And I am the only Son of a bastard I know That knows the bastard too Because it was you But if I was you I'd make this a simpler story...
wow, isn't this peachy?
who's got any more pills?
Effy?
don't you think you've had enough?
don't think. Makes life much easier.
Naomi, darling?
got any more of your special powder?
no? Don't, Em.
Where's Cook when you need him, eh?
somebody phone for more pills.
another fun day at Mrs and Mrs Campbell's.
come on! What's wrong with everyone?
turn the music up
come on, you boring bastards.
can I interest you ladies in a "cooked to perfection" burger?
don't think so.
Hey, babes. Did you miss me?
Oh ecstasy Ecstasy...
d'you want me to ask everyone to leave?
Thanks, Thomas.
what's the point?
it's all fucked anyway.
what the fuck are you doing, Emily?
Emily, fucking stop this shit now!
Naomi, darling, am I making you nice and wet?
fuck you! This is a fucking pantomime.
fuck you right back.
ems, stop it.
stay out of this.
what? Want to fuck her, is that it?
maybe I do. So what?
that's enough.
what's this all about?
it's none of your business.
I fucked the dead girl.
I fucked Sophia and gave her the drugs and now she's punishing me for it.
I knew you'd screw her up.
Hey! Good news, everyone.
I found us a caravan.
what have I missed?
why don't you all just fuck off?
look at you.
pretending to be happy families, pretending to love each other.
don't you dare speak to me like that.
get off your high horse.
I can't... I can't be here any more.
bit melodramatic
remind you of anyone?
stop it!
come on, son.
em...
I've lived my life Inside daydream, lies Imaginary friends That always knew Knew One day I'd leave Leave for good...
I'm coming, I've just got to... I'll catch up with you.

...Heart, heart...
Oh!

Yes, yes, I'll get you a towel and...
.Putain!
just sit down.
bit of a pickle!
do you think I'm a bitch, Thomas?
I think you are Katie. You should always be you.
you're strong and...
I'm just too aggressive, just like my fucking mum.
I know it. I am a bitch.
everyone relies on you to tell the truth, Katie.
they need you.
that thing you do - is it for real?
what thing?
the lovely honourable thing.
I'm not.
I screw up so often.
panda, college...
...everything.
right now I'm Monsieur Screw.
d'you fancy me?
just checking.
of course.
I can't have kids.
they say I can't have kids...
...ever.
and you're sad?
you think maybe no man will ever want you?
but I am a man, and I think you're a beautiful, magnificent woman.
panda was an idiot not to forgive you.
I was the idiot.
I wasn't honourable.
we can be friends.
Yes, I'd like that.
me too.
don't you put those things in my bag I need space for my stuff I try to get the end of the bread To give myself a feed more Don't you put those things in my bag Cos all these things are running round my head Catch them, stop them Hold them in your hands Cos all these things are running round my head Catch them, stop them Hold them in your hands
give me five minutes.
mum?
Mum...I can't have children.
I went to the doctor's yesterday and they said there's nothing they can do.
I wanted to tell you, but you were too busy shouting.
it's all about you.
I don't want to let you down, but you let me down.
I really needed you and you weren't there.
my baby girl.
it doesn't matter, Mum.
the house and the money - I don't want it.
I'm not going to be you.
I just want a mum who loves me, no matter what.
I do love you, no matter what.
I'm so sorry.
and we love you, Mum.
so appreciate us.
stop trying to push us away.
Jen.
I love you.
you stupid bastard!
I'm sorry.
Ugh! They're using tongues and everything.
on this hilltop I buried you As a younger man We gathered round Your empty house And spoke of how you were so loved And as the sun died I promised I would seek you out Now the years have Weathered me And soon I claim you for my arms Again And if our hearts All disappear And if our bones They crumble to the soil
Morocco! Whoo!
holiday!
I'm flying.
whoa, hang on...
if you tell a soul
I'll fucking kill you, all right?
screw you! You mind fuck.
what's going on, bro?
I think maybe she can't do it. Be with someone.
when you pull, the more she goes away.
come with me.
where?
anywhere.
I asked some friends who hides drugs in empty houses.
yeah? Who?
english boy. His name is Luke. He is bad. Very bad.
we want a favour.
why should I do anything for him?
the girl. You've been fucking her. Now Luke's going to fuck her.
come on. Stop them.
what's going on?
slow down! Matty, slow down!
stop the car. Stop it!
this is it!
why did he run like that?
grace.
# Oh, woman, what's your problem?
I want you to tell me that I've got some when it is you who is the one who in fact has some # Oh, you filthy woman # You're a filthy, filthy woman # You're a filthy, filthy woman # You filthy, filthy, filthy, filthy, filthy woman! #
where are you going, buddy?
somewhere that smells less like our balls.
that is not balls, man, that is soul lubricant.
I'm pretty sure it's balls.
O'malley, please, yeah!
just one more, right? It's right fucking there, man.
I'm late for visiting time.
well, it's hardly visiting time if Blood won't let you in.
that's not the point.
what if this is it, man, the day we perfect Filthy Woman, get a contract and we start the revolution, as discussed?
and what if today's the day she wakes up?
thank you.
Hi, it's Grace, smile and speak at the beep.
grace...
it's me... again.
can you just wake up?
I love you.
did you hear what I said there?
I love you.
yeah?
I fucking love you.
grace?
rich.
grace. Are you all right, can you hear me?
why aren't you here?
I... I tried. I tried.
we all did.
your dad won't let us in.
then try harder, Richard.
what?
stairs # Ain't no kid gonna realise
barred. Non-relative, no patient access. If you see this boy please inform security immediately. Call EXT 572.
# Change is forever turning by # Things are moving awfully fast # Grab your keys and grab that bag # We're going to follow # Follow your dreams #
seriously, Richard?
are we seriously doing this again?
Oh, come on, give me a break, Pauline. She's the love of my life.
look... Two minutes and I'm gone, yeah?
the love of my life.
I don't know, Richard.
the love of my life.
stop saying that!
it's working, though.
Yes! No, no!
look. Why don't you...?
nurse, call security, tell them that the boy has got in... again.
don't bother. I know the way out.
this is exactly the kind of blatant emotionalism we shan't have to deal with in Switzerland.
grace might benefit from being around people who love her.
professor Blood. Wait, please!
he is inappropriate, indecorous, inane and in a great deal of trouble.
don't you think this is a bit hasty?
my daughter deserves the finest medical care available and a clinic in Zurich is the finest...
Zurich?
in all of Europe.
I want her ready to leave for Switzerland by this evening.
good day.
# They don't care at all # At all, at all...
# Follow, follow your dream.#
grace.
Argh!
there's a door over there, you know.
Shhh...
it's hard to explain. Involves your crazy dad.
he is crazy, you know.
I'm disappointed. I thought you would find your way in sooner.
if you were worth your salt.
well... I'm here now and that's the main thing.
that's the main thing.
don't ever get ill on me again, OK? I mean it.
like... ever.
I mean it.
OK.
dad's taking me to Switzerland to get better.
Yeah, I know.
I probably really love you,
