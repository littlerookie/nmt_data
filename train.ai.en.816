when a friend hurts you, it's like everything else they do hurts.
and... I couldn't take it anymore.
friends forgive.
I just... I wanted my Connie back.
I just, I... I wanted her back.
I'm sorry.
come on, let's go.
ladies and gentlemen, as you know, it's a horrifically sad day at Miami-Dade Roller Derby with the passing of a rising superstar,
wrath of Connie.
her tragic death has stunned all of us, and the derby world.
so, in her honor, her teammate from the Masochists, D' Beat Down, will skate around in her memory and show her love and respect for one of the fans' favorites.
wrath of Connie, rest in peace.
now, fans, despite how difficult this must be, are you ready to strap in and get your derby on?
let me feel you, Miami! Are you with me?
in honor of Wrath of Connie, bring it!
let's get crazy.
how 'bout a little action?
show me what you're made of, Miami.
so, what, my helmet's with my bike?
Hey...Hey!
God!
what the hell is your problem, man?
you caught your killer. It means I get to leave.
you should be going to prison for murder.
sit down.
you've lost it, man.
you broke the lady's rib.
had that not happened, she may still be alive today.
that never happened.
she fell off the back of my bike.
she can be... clumsy that way.
your abuse took her life.
whatever, man.
you know, if I'm gonna be treated like this,
I'm gonna want to talk to a lawyer.
fair enough.
it might take him a while to get here.
I'll wait.
so will I.
what are you doing? Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Wait! Wait!
good morning, Miami Time, 96. 9.
weather update: high 85, low 72...
welcome to the Ember. Reception's right inside...- Thanks.
welcome to the Ember.
you did not just make it here before I did.- Good morning, slowpoke.
I live 15 minutes from here, and there's no way you made it here before me.
unless you used the siren.
nobody told me I couldn't.- You used the siren, didn't you? Cheater.
do you want to tell me why I'm missing out an hour of beauty sleep?
Yes, because we got a report of a dead body.
the cabana boy called it in, said he was spooked.
what do you mean,"spooked"?
okay, well, I'm awake now,- Oh, my...stop!
as is everyone else in a four-mile radius.
this has been doing this all week.- Tell you what.
you take care of that, I'll, uh, handle the situation inside.
okay, I'll catch up with you.
stop!
are you the hotel manager?
finally. We called you 20 minutes ago.- Uh, where's the body?
keep your voice down, the guests could hear you.
Where's the body?- It's in the cabana. But the door is locked.
my security chief is on his way down with the master key.
it's the last cabana on the left.- Okay.
have a nice day.
no wonder the cabana boy was spooked.
got the key.
Oh, no. Is it that bad?
I just don't want it to be a bloater. I had two bloaters last week.
I just can't do another one.- Uh, it's not a bloater.
it's a, it's a...It's a floater.
what do you mean? What...a floater? How is it a floater?
the hat...what happened to the hat?
it was just floating.- Like in the air, floating?
as in three inches above the body.
look, I got a photo of it.
that's a...great reflection of you.
what?
the hat was floating.
you might want to catch up on that beauty sleep.
I know what I saw.
I'll tell you, I know what I see. This guy took a real-life beating.
head injury with multiple contact wounds.
we've got numerous cast-off stains.
he was hit more than once.
well, once could be an accident, but more than that is murder.
his name is Derek Vaughn.
he's rented that particular cabana by the week for the last six months.
did he have many visitors?
my daughter Luisa handles day-to-day operations. I can ask her.
no need. I'll talk to her.
listen, Lieutenant, I would really appreciate it if you kept this out of the press.
I can't afford to scare away my guests.
you know, Mr. Romero, right now public relations is the least of your problems.
I have no idea who Mr. Vaughn entertained in his cabana.
you're the director of operations of this hotel, ma'am.
lieutenant, we don't spy on our guests.
we value their privacy, so all that mattered was that he paid his rent on time.
what was the rent on the cabana?
$2, 000 a day,$14, 000 a week.- That's a big number.
what was his method of payment?- Mm, always paid by check.
okay. Where are those checks now?
Hey, there he is!
our very own Criss Angel.
better make sure that that bag is sealed tight.
you don't want the hat to...float away.
never going to live this down, am I?
no, we've got some serious mileage left on this one, pal.
okay. Well, then, let's get this over with as quickly as possible, 'cause I don't want to spend any more time in this place.
well, Natalia said that our victim got hit over the head with an object.
any of those things our murder weapon?
these? No. They're negative.
but whatever hit him in the head was definitely heavy,'cause it penetrated his skull.
we have oval-shaped droplets on the wall.
tails arcing toward the door.
90-degree spatter on the ceiling.
so my guess is the killer stood here.
he swung whatever weapon it was in a clubbing fashion.
maybe we can find his footprints.
well, uh...what makes you so sure he's a he?
you know something I don't know?
well, we got about five or six different strands of hair here.
they're all long, and they're all different colors.
and look at this.
box of condoms. Guess our victim was a player.
maybe he played with the wrong girl.
boyfriend got angry, showed up...
tell you what...
I'll get in contact with Horatio, see if I can't get a list of our victim's guests.
you can't wait to get out of here, can you?
I'm bringing the hat with me.
Hello?
no. I can't bring it in, because as you can hear, it won't stop.
no, I need somebody to come here.
No! Three hours? I need somebody now!
this is the third time today.
can you hear me?
you're breaking up. Really?
wow, the tech gods must be angry at you.
I could hear your alarm all the way from the hotel bar.
you need some help?
if you're a mechanic, I guess.
I'm not, but I'm good with my hands.- Okay.
is it all right?- Yeah, be my guest.
guys, I got it.
you know what you're doing?
okay. That should do it.
shouldn't give you any more trouble.
I'd still see a mechanic.
wow, thank you. How did you learn to do that? It was awesome.
my dad. I could change your oil, too, if you want.
no, I'm good. I'm good. Thanks.
well, how about...dinner, instead?
what's your name?- It's Joe.
Joe, hi. Natalia. Nice to meet you.
uh, let me give you my card. I have to run back to work.
here you go.- Great, thanks.
officer Boa Vista.
officer. Yeah. Is that a problem?
not at all. I'll call you.
okay. Thanks again.
Yeah.
what are you, eight years old?- Seven.
what is wrong with you?
look, man, that hat seems like it's really messing with you.
come on. I know everyone thinks I'm crazy, but I swear to God, I saw this hat floating.
I saw it happen.- I believe you.
Yeah, keep busting my chops. I know I'm not crazy.
the hat was floating. It was up in the air.
Wolfe, I said I believe you.
you do?- Yes.
I've seen my fair share of strange things on crime scenes.- Yeah.
remember the "ghost"?- Yeah.
see? The thing is, there's always a logical explanation.- Yes, there is.
so, let's figure it out.- Okay.
these are the victim's rent checks.
Yeah, a runner just dropped them off. They're all payable to Derek, and not the hotel.
Yes, but they've been endorsed to the hotel.
Yeah. They're all from different women, too.
I mean, there's a $500 check for weeding?
$700 check for tree-trimming.
$300 check for planting.
this guy must have a gold-plated hedge clipper.
he was no gardener, Frank.
he could be an escort.
there's only one dated yesterday, from a Gretchen Cambridge.
Cambridge. Okay. Take Natalia and go see Ms. Cambridge.
I'm going back to the hotel.
think they knew they were renting out a cabana to a gigolo?
let's find out.
my husband's going to be home any minute.
you're married?
I don't know how I'm going to explain this to Steven.
well, you can start by explaining it to us.
steven travels for business.
but when he's home, it's golf, or the computer.
it's like I'm invisible.
I needed someone to fill the emptiness.
so you hired a gigolo?
a friend of mine told me about this guy who worked out of the Ember.
she said he was discreet, and that's exactly what I needed.
a gigolo?
you wanted a younger man to use for sex?
good night.- Good night.
it wasn't like that. It wasn't about the sex.
he really cared about me.
you look incredible.
it's the lighting.
it's your eyes.
it's your mouth.
it's your body.
I'm too old for you.
your beauty is ageless.
the guy serviced a lot of women.
you sure you didn't get jealous?
I didn't care about the other women.
when I was with him, it was just us.
and where does your husband figure into all this?
does he know about Derek?
steven didn't kill Derek.
he wasn't even here last night. He was in Idaho all week.
that's my husband. Please don't say anything about this.
he is going to find out eventually.- I've told you everything I know about Derek.
I have no idea what happened to him.
everything okay, officers?
your, uh, your wife just made a very generous donation to the police fund.
Oh, well, Gretchen has a generous heart.
that she has.
so we'll be back to collect.
you ready?- Yeah.
watch and learn.
what?
how did you...How'd you do that?
sulfur hexafluoride gas is denser than air.
so in a closed space, like this box, or an unventilated cabana, it sinks to the bottom, displacing the air upwards.
and along with it goes the Panama hat.- Exactly.
you know what doesn't make sense, though...
if there was gas in that cabana, why wouldn't I have smelled it?
well, you wouldn't necessarily smell it unless the additive was there.
suppliers are required by law to add a chemical that makes it smell so you can detect leaks.
pure gases are odorless. You'll never know they're there.
okay, so we didn't have a pure source of sulfur hexafluoride.
what are some other gases that are heavier than air?
butane, propane, acetylene...- Wait a second.
there was a fireplace in the cabana.
one of those gas fireplaces...that has propane.
maybe. I doubt a burning fireplace would put out enough vapors to float a hat.
unless there's a leak.
the propane...one spark.
Yeah.
Oh, my God. And Calleigh and Delko are still there!
Yes, Mr. Wolfe.
traveling now.
get down!
Eric! Get up!
come on, get up!
Eric, come on, get up. We got to get out of here.
help! Help! Help! Help!
let's go! Get up! Get up!
help! Somebody help!
come on!- Eric!
get up!
you guys okay?
Yeah. I got a hell of a headache, but I'll be all right.
wish I could say the same for the evidence. It's all been destroyed.
you said the hat was floating when you got on the scene this morning?
Yeah, that's right. The sinking propane caused it to rise off the floor.
what are you thinking?
I'm thinking heavy gas like propane settles close to the floor.
right where the victim was lying.
haven't finished yet.
listen, I've got some information I think might help.
the victim was exposed to high levels of propane gas.
I am seeing nonspecific acute visceral congestion.
along with pinpoint hemorrhages in the epicardium.
all signs of asphyxiation.
propane displaces oxygen in the lungs.
without oxygen, Derek was likely dead within minutes.
what about the head injury?
Dr. Loman, code three.
I just got called to a triple. You'll have to wait for my final report.
Derek didn't die from the head injury.
the propane killed him first.
Really?
you know, the leak could have been a accident.
maybe, but before the explosion,
I noticed that the gas shut-off valve on the fireplace was dented.
we need to go back in and take another look at the fireplace.
yeah.- Yeah.
everybody stay where you are.
what do you think you're doing?
I'm shutting you down.- Why?
you almost got two of my people killed, because your propane had no odor.
that's illegal.- What?
you take care of payroll, I got this.
I swear, I had no idea we were buying illegal propane.
like you had no idea Derek Vaughn was a gigolo.
you're looking at some pretty serious charges, Hector.
criminal negligence, running a prostitution ring...
and that's just for starters, Hector.
okay, look, listen, I admit I knew about Derek's profession.
but I'm not a pimp.
he paid me for the cabana, that's all.
what about the propane?
I want to get to the bottom of that as much as you do.
call your supplier right now.
Mitch, this is Hector. We had a leak.
can you come and take a look at it before your delivery guy fills the tank?
Mitch Fielder. My name is Lieutenant Caine.
Where's Hector?
Hector...is cleaning up your mess.
what's going on?
this propane has no additive in it.
therefore, it's illegal.- No way. I'm completely aboveboard.
is that right?
so if I were to put this in your car, and turn it on, you'd smell the propane?
wait, wait.
okay, you're right. There's nothing to smell.
a man died because of that propane.
I'm not the only one responsible.
the hotel knew exactly what they were getting.
not according to Hector.
then he's lying.
I guess we'll see.
Hey, where you going, Mr. Romero?
I'm late for a staff meeting back at the hotel.
the meeting's been canceled, Hector.
Mitch Fielder told us that you knew exactly what you were buying.
that's a lie. He cheated me.
Oh, so then these aren't your signatures on these purchase orders?
there it is in black and white, Hector.
listen, we've been losing money ever since the economy tanked.
and I...did what I could do.
I got rid of the maid service.- You rented out the cabana to gigolos.
and you purchased cheap propane, Hector.
there are 200 fireplaces at the hotel.
on every balcony, by the pool, in the cabanas.
we burn through a tanker of propane every week.
that's why I had to switch to the cheapest supplier, you know what I mean?
he doesn't get it.- No, he doesn't.
Hector, this is no longer criminal negligence.
it's now negligent homicide.
what? I thought somebody hit him on the head.
they did. And after he was hit, he died of propane asphyxiation.
well, I didn't mean for that to happen.
but it did. And now you're under arrest.
Hey, take a look at this.
I found the shut-off valve.
do you remember it being this dented before the explosion?
the dent looks the same.
whoever did this used a lot of force to make this kind of a dent.
this wasn't an accident. We got to put this fireplace back together.
it's the only way we're going to figure out who caused this leak.
I've got a torn piece of paper.
must have blown here during the blast.
what does it say?- I can't tell, it's been scorched.
okay, it's a North Biscayne High School parking pass.
the student's last name is Davis.
Yeah, uh, North Biscayne High School, please.
Yeah, this is, uh, CSI Simmons from the Miami-Dade crime lab.
trying to figure out if you have a student there named Davis.
no, last name...Davis.
Really? Emma?
and she's there today? Okay, thank you.
did you find the student?- Not exactly.
I can't lose my job.
you're a teacher, Ms. Davis.
you probably should have thought about that before you solicited a man for sex.
he solicited me!
I can tell you I'm not surprised that he's dead.
Oh, really? Did you know he was gonna be killed?
No! No, God, no.
it's just that I'm not surprised that the first guy that I slept with wound up dead hours later.
Yeah, I was a 30-year-old virgin.
in high school, it was a choice.
in college, it just never happened. And it became this insurmountable thing.
I just figured I had to do it, get it over with or I never would.
and that's why you went to Derek.
we met at the Ember last week.
did you hook up with him that night?
no.
I finally did it yesterday after school.
and when you found out that you were just another paying customer...
that make you mad?
No! No, I-I had a great time.
it felt like a real date.
he made me feel so comfortable.
he was...he was really nice.
I've never done this before.
there's nothing to be ashamed of.
no, I mean, it's my first time.
it's my first time, too...
with you.
we'll take it slowly.
well, I appreciate your time, and your candor.
Oh, wait.
I don't know if this'll help, but yesterday when I was, um, at the hotel,
I saw Derek arguing with a man.
Oh, really? Did you hear what they were arguing about?
clients and money.
I think he was a gigolo, too.
What'd he looked like?
get up! Get over there!
is this because I didn't call you?
you're really good. You actually had me. I would never known what you did for a living.
can't a guy hit on a beautiful woman?
not when you take money for the privilege. It's called prostitution.
a witness saw you fighting with Derek last night. What were you fighting about?
he stole a girl from me; a virgin.
you know how much we can make off one of those?
that was fun.- Come back anytime.
Hey, Derek, are you kidding me?
she had her eye on me. I was about to close that deal.
you scared her off, so she came to me.
you owe me money, all right? You can't keep taking my clients.
Really? What are you gonna do about it?
look, Derek didn't just rob me of my fee.
these women shower us with gifts. He cost me those, too.
guy turns up with a bashed-in skull.
makes you suspect number one.
I'm not saying another word.
you want to play it like that? Fine, pretty boy.
let's see how you do in county lockup. Get his ass out of here.
you all right?- Yeah, thanks.
we still don't know what Derek was hit with.
we didn't find any weapon at the scene.
maybe Derek here can help us out with that.
damn, those are some nice abs. This guy must have lived at the gym.
where did he find time to squeeze in all the women?
always time to squeeze in women.
especially if they're paying.
a lot of coagulated blood.
probably suffered an intracranial hemorrhage.
my guess is he would have bled out if the propane hadn't gotten to him first.
got a little something in this wound.
would you do me a favor and hand me the magnifying glass and tweezers, please?
gracias.
Yeah.
are those dandruff flakes?
maybe from our gigolo Joe.
his dandruff could have fallen onto the vic when he attacked him.
care to take it to Trace?
thank you.
the flakes are PVC plastic.
but I can't think of anything made of PVC heavy enough to fracture a skull.
what if it were part of a weapon?
this may help.
the flakes are coated with water and glycerin.
why would that be on the outside of a weapon?
it's not what's on the outside. It's what's on the inside.
I'm totally lost.
okay. When I was a little, my dad used to take me to the Derby.
I loved horses.
and I would always beg him to buy me a horse.
so my dad bought me a snow globe with a stallion on the inside.
so, you're saying that the flakes we found on the body is actually snow from inside a snow globe?
exactly.
it's the water-glycerin mixture that makes the snow float.
what if these leaked out when Derek was hit on the head?
what kind of guy brings a snow globe to attack someone?
could be a woman.
you know, Joe did say that a lot of women give gifts to the gigolos.
maybe one of the women bought it as a gift but ended up using it as a weapon.
Edie's soups
here you go.
Really?

Wait-wait-wait. Go back.
was that Claudine Cadeaux? It's "Claudine's Gifts.
Maison Du Chocolat...a boule de neige.
snow globe.
that's the snow globe!
whose statement is that?
it's Gretchen, our housewife.
I told you it's not here.
I gave the snow globe to Derek. He kept it in the cabana.
anyone could have hit him with it.
well, if that's the case, Ms. Cambridge, then you have nothing to worry about, right?
sticky.
this hammer's got some white flakes on it.
I'll bet you this was used to smash the snow globe.
Where's the trash?
Mrs. Cambridge?
do you recognize that?
it's a piece of a snow globe.
and can you tell me how it got that way?
I...I, uh...
I hit Derek on the back of the head with it.
you hit him on the back of the head?
that's...that's strange, because Derek was actually hit on the front of the head.
Mrs. Cambridge, you are clearly covering for someone.
no, no, listen, you have to believe me. I'm telling you the truth.
it's me. It's me.- Enough! Enough.
all right? No more lies.
I suspected you were cheating on me, so I waited until you left the house, and I followed you.
it couldn't have been you...You weren't...
I came back from my business trip a day early.
that was amazing.- Good night.
and that's when you confronted Derek.
I thought I could convince him to stop seeing her.
just leave my wife alone.
well, maybe if you paid better attention to her, she'd stop coming back to me.
where did you get this?
Gretchen gave it to me.
I saw you buy that snow globe when we were in Paris.
I just assumed it was for me.
and when I saw it at the cabana...
I lost it.
all those nights alone...
all those endless business trips...
I thought you stopped loving me.
I never did.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
don't.
Mr. Cambridge, one more question.
did you break the valve on the fireplace before or after the attack on Derek?
I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't go anywhere near the fireplace.
take him.
I believe him.
so do I.
well, if he didn't cause the gas leak, that leaves one question.
who did?
that's made of leather.
that doesn't belong in a fireplace.
are those traction ridges?- They are.
it's from the sole of a shoe.
Yeah, the killer must've left it behind after he kicked the valve.
so we find the shoe that matches...
we find the killer.
H...I got something on the propane leak.
based on the flow rate and the size of the cabana, it would've taken about two hours for the propane to become deadly.
Yeah, but there was no guarantee that Derek would stay in there the entire time.
okay...
maybe the killer didn't plan to suffocate him.
well, that's true, because I think they were counting on him to light the fireplace, to cause an explosion.
that's a good plan in theory, except the victim would have smelled the gas and decided to leave.
unless the killer knew he wouldn't.
well, Hector Romero wouldn't have had a motive, then.
cause he was making a lot of money off Derek.
he certainly was, which means somebody else knew about the propane.
hang on a second, folks.
we posted bail. They said I could leave.
why do you want to talk to my dad again?
I don't want to talk to your dad.
I want to talk to you.
you run the day-to-day operations at the hotel.
Yes, so?
so, you would know that the propane was odorless.
let me see your shoes, please.
they're clean.- They may be, but the foot isn't, is it?
you just weren't wearing these shoes last night. You had open-toe shoes on?
how do you know that?- Because you have frostbite.
it's from exposure to propane.
from when you kicked the valve on the fireplace.
want to tell us what happened?
Derek and I were seeing each other.
what? You were with that gigolo?
I knew what he was, and I thought I could handle it.
but then I kept seeing...those checks.
here, babe. This should cover the rest of this week's rent.
busy week.
Oh, I'm sorry.
sorry enough to quit?
we've been through this.
I know.
but um...
I'm falling in love with you.
me, too.
I'm gonna hit the showers.
I knew the next girl he brought in here, he'd light the fireplace and they'd both die.
I hope you're satisfied.
take her, please.
come on.- No, no. No, no, no. Dad?
that's not funny, Walter.
come on!- Not funny!
it's funny.- No, it wasn't.
thank you, Walter.
the lady's raise is yours to match, Mr. Paxton.

you got to be kidding me. Who invited her?
was it you?
suspect description, same as the Bal Harbor robbery,
H-devil mask, a TEC-9 automatic.
so it's him again, isn't it, Walter?
Yup. Makes it, what, ten big games that he's hit so far?
wonder how much he got away with this time. One, maybe two million?
all right, so, the chandelier must have gotten hit when the robber opened fire.
dropped on this poor bastard who picked the wrong seat, crushing him to death.
maybe not, Walter. That's a bullet hole.
look at that. Sure is.
glass from the broken chandelier bulbs inside the wound means that he was shot before the chandelier fell on him.
collateral damage from the shooting.
guy's never shot anybody before, H. He's making mistakes.
Yes, he is, Walter.
and we all pay for our mistakes.
so tell me how this guy smashed through that window.
it's tempered glass, at least a half-inch thick.
maybe it was tampered with.
I'm going to take this evidence back with me to the P. D. - Thank you.
Hey, Tom, what have you got?
meet Benjamin Paxton, one of Hollywood's biggest movie producers.
is there something wrong?
the wound to his neck is the gunshot exit wound, not the entrance.
Where's the entrance?
Tom, there's some blood here.
wait, there's an entrance wound here, above his hip, but it appears it's the only one on his body.
wait a minute, you're telling me that it came into his hip and went out through his neck?
how is that possible?
I think it rode the subway.
meaning...
it ricocheted off his hip bone into his abdominal aorta and hitched a ride up into his heart, then passed along his clavicle before it exited out his trapezius muscle.
it's fascinating.
so, where did the subway bullet end up?
sadly, that is not my department.
how goes it, teddy bear?
good, how about you? What are you doing here? The sun's still out.
I scratched and clawed to get off nights, and here I am, day-shifting.
Yeah, I don't miss graveyard much either.
how about you? You miss me?
not really, no.
liar.
what's with the box on my desk?
your desk? Wow, okay, that was quick.
this-I collected all this from the crime scene. I need you to look it over.
heard somebody jumped through a window or something crazy.
Yeah, yeah, in the past, this guy just marched in to rob some poker games, but now he's making Cliffhanger moves.
sounds like he's evolving. - Yeah.
loose bills, cards, a flask.
uh, what exactly should I be looking for?
anything and everything, Sam O. - Right.
all right, everybody, listen up. You're interfering with a police investigation, so just back off.
did somebody die? - I said back off.
yo, that's Isaiah Stiles, the rapper.
stay there.
Hey, come here a second.
you hurt? - Yeah, I got clipped upstairs.
Tom, come here a second. Take a look.
Hey, man, hurry up before paparazzi sees me like this, hurry up.
want to tell me how you just now figured out you got shot?
likely from a rush of adrenaline.
the effect made his body oblivious to the wound.
Oh, what are you...?
Hey, thanks a lot for your help. - All right, hold on a second.
let's go get you bandaged up, and then we're gonna take a little trip downtown. Let's go.
I got a bullet for you down here.
that's impossible.
I just finished bagging the last of the 30 bullets that our robber fired.
that would give us one nine-millimeter too many.
well, you're the expert, but it looks to me like a. 45.
I just retrieved it out of one of the players.
Really?
Tom, if you've got a. 45, I think that's our subway bullet.
are you implying it exited Benjamin Paxton's neck and struck another person?
I'm not implying; I think that's true.
come on, the only thing you're gonna find in my pockets is my lawyer's business card.
what are you guys looking for, anyway? - A. 45 automatic.
sorry, I only use guns in my movies.
Mr. Hollywood's clean, H.
what, you're arresting me-on what charge? - For illegal gambling.
you're kidding. I'll be out by lunch.
ma'am, could I see inside your bag, please?
it's not what it looks like.
that... is exactly what it looks like.
you're under arrest.
a producer, a rapper, a movie star, and now you-a housewife.
I don't understand.
look, I-I was at an illegal poker game, I'll admit that, but I didn't shoot anyone.
but why have a gun?
because I was waiting for him.
you were waiting for the thief.
six months ago he robbed a game that my son Kevin was playing at.
Kevin tried to stop him, and the thief hit him over the back of the head with his gun, and it caused a hemorrhage and Kevin almost died.
I remember the case.
Kevin really was such a brilliant kid, and I'm not just saying this 'cause I'm his mother.
I mean, he was going to medical school in the fall.
so, you were at the game for revenge.
Yeah.
Kevin wasn't even a gambler.
after his dad passed away, he was kind of lost, and I think he just started gambling to cope with it.
how is he doing now?
his issues come and go.
he's in therapy, but he still suffers from memory loss and confusion.
okay.
how did you get invited into the game?
he operated the games that Kevin used to play.
so I contacted him.
my big games are A-listers only.
why should I let some Miami Lakes housewife have a seat at one of my tables?
that's why.
you gonna give me the address now, or what?
I can be persuaded.
took out a second mortgage on my home.
and then, before I knew it, I was playing every high-stakes poker game there was.
just waiting for the thief to return.
Yeah. I know it sounds stupid, but what else could I do?
you could have called the police.
that's what I would have done.
Wolfe, give me what you got. You find anything on that glass?
no blood on the glass which means the robber didn't cut himself coming through the window.
it's tempered glass-for high-rises.
so Tarzan comes swinging in, he collides with this glass...
it should have pancaked him, right?
exactly, which is why I switched my search from looking for biologicals to looking for some sign of tampering.
here. What do you think that means?
it's got a groove on it.
right. This one here.
another groove.
well, it's not from the manufacturer.
and it's deep, too - at least a quarter of the way through.
that would compromise the strength of the glass.
which means it was done from the inside.
which also confirms that our robber was working with a partner.
not a lot of materials that could cut glass this deep.
no. A diamond, maybe.
then again, ceramic can cut up glass pretty good, too.
did you just say ceramic?
Yep. These are ceramic frames, just like I thought.
Oh, they're all scratched up.
that happen when you were scoring the windows for the robber?
please. Yeah, well, see, we talked to your ex-publicist, and she said you're in the hole for $400, 000 from playing poker.
where I come from, that's chump change.
where I come from, that's motive.
so you rob the game, you take the cash, you pay off your debt.
that's a good plan.
except I'm on the verge of signing my next big movie.
was going to pay off the debt with that.
do you guys seriously think I would throw away my entire career over some poker money?
no, but do you know what I do seriously think?
you're a really bad actor, and you're not going to be able to lie your way through this.
well, until you can prove that, me and my glasses will be on set.
Yeah, except they give us probable cause, so you and your glasses are going to have to sit down.
ballistics came back negative.
she didn't shoot anybody.
she's telling the truth, and the shooter is still out there.
question is, why didn't someone see a shooter with a. 45 kill Paxton?
so there's one way to find out.
okay, based on our recovered casings, our robber shot his TEC-9 from there.
and he left a void.
shot to the left and the right above the table. He hit the door.
Yeah.
he didn't even come close to hitting Paxton, let alone the table.
so he was just trying to scare people.
Yeah, that confirms that our robber with the TEC-9 didn't shoot him.
it means there was a second shooter in the room who shot him with a. 45.
the question is, where was he in the room?
originally, we thought that Paxton was sitting at the table and he turned to shield himself.
right, he turned away from the robber coming through the window.
but he couldn't have been shot from that angle because the wound is too low.
the table would have shattered.
what if he was facing straight ahead?
well, then that would mean that the. 45 that hit him came from across the room.
now, look at that. We got marks.
here you go.
Thanks.
Hey, Ryan, this vent is bent.
I will bet you anything that our shooter put his gun through it.
perfect line of sight. Easy shot for somebody who knows what they're doing.
Yep. It's positive for GSR.
okay, that confirms our shooter was up there.
one robber breaks in through the window, lights up the room, just as our guy in the vent is taking a shot.
then it exited through one victim and into Isaiah Stiles's arm.
but why would he shoot at Paxton? It's not like he's a threat.
so that no one would know he was a target.
Ryan, this was an assassination.
Walter, check this out.
the robbers weren't there just to get the money. They were there to kill Ben Paxton, too.
Really? - Yeah.
what do you got?
I analyzed the playing cards from the poker game, and I found something.
take a look at this.
it has a combination of tumeric and rubbing alcohol on it, which, when combined, creates...
fluorescent ink? - Right.
which is the same ink used by the government to mark bills.
but it's invisible to the naked eye, so...
every face card was marked with it.
okay, somebody was cheating at the poker game.
and if it was Paxton, that might be why somebody wanted him dead.
could be.
now, if somebody was marking the cards with special ink, how'd they do it without being seen?
by being very, very sly, boys.
see, I found traces of ink both in this glass and flask, and also on the drinking straw.
okay, so the cheater poured the ink from the flask into the glass by pretending it was alcohol...
and then used the straw to mark the cards with the ink.
okay, so they marked the cards.
but like I said, it's invisible to the naked eye, so how'd they see it?
there was no big UV light hanging in the hotel room.
by using lenses that enhance UV.
I checked Jason Huntsman's glasses, and they don't have the UV-enhancing lenses.
he was the only player with glasses.
right, but take a look at Evelyn Bowers' booking photo.
take a look at her license photo.
yeah?
notice something about the eyes? - Brown eyes in the license photo.
and the booking photo-they're blue.
that could only mean one thing.
Evelyn, on your driver's license, you have brown eyes.
so why are your eyes blue now?
you can help yourself here.
fine.
Joey's games just kept getting bigger and bigger.
cheating was the only way I could afford to stay in them.
so you had to win to keep playing.
by marking the face cards.
and those contacts allowed you to see the marks.
I didn't know what else to do.
the man who ruined my son's life was out there walking free.
he had to pay.
okay, but that's not up to you. I can't sleep at night.
I have these nightmares about what this man did to my baby.
I just want the nightmares to end.
okay, so contact the hotel manager and find out why an armed man had access to those vents.
excuse me. - Yes, sir.
can I help you? - I'm here, um, to post bail for my mom.
okay, your mom's name is? - Evelyn Bowers.
I-I would've been here earlier, but I had to bum a ride.
okay. All right, um, have a seat.
I'll be right back. All right?
okay. All right.
Mrs. Bowers, your son is here to post bail.
Kevin? That's impossible.
why do you say that? - I told him to stay home.
he's a kid; he doesn't have any money.
I mean, he just, he gets confused a lot after his injury.
okay. What are you planning to do?
I don't know. I'll figure something out.
but in the meantime, he needs to get home till I can get out of here.
what if I were to give him a ride?
you would do that? - Sure. Sit tight.
it's locked.
you got a key? - Yeah, yeah, I think, I think so.
sometimes sequences get out of order and, you know...
gets all jumbled up in my head.
Thanks.
you know, it's just hard to keep track.
notes help.
my mom. She's good to me.
Kevin, where's the furniture?
my mom sold it. Well, most of it.
she's in trouble, isn't she?
I hope not.
I got your text. What's up?
okay, I've been going over these photos that Ryan took in the air vent at the hotel.
that's where the second shooter was, yeah. You got anything?
well, you see that imprint of the triangle? It turns out, it's blood.
that's great. We get a DNA hit?
no, so I sent it over to Trace and it popped positive for titanium.
that's weird, right?
maybe not, right?
the naturally occurring oxide from titanium is titanium dioxide, which, when it's in pigment form, is titanium...
titanium white.
which is used in the application of tattoos.
are you thinking this is from a freshly-inked tattoo?
I'm thinking that when our shooter might have pressed up against the vent, it left an imprint.
who gets a tattoo of a triangle?
people are getting tattoos altered and added to all the time these days.
so you're thinking the triangle could have been added to a preexisting tat?
Yeah, or around an old one.
it would explain the void that's there.
we got to figure out what the original image is.
that looks like an H. Or some symbol.
we've been adding tattoos to booking photos.
let me input this and see if something comes up.
okay, this guy is in jail, but that's the gang tattoo of the Hialeah Kings.
Yeah, well, I think I know someone that knows a bit about that and could possibly help us with the second shooter.
Thanks.
each triangle represents a job done-robbery, arson, you name it.
far as I'm concerned, they can tattoo "born to lose" on their forehead.
have you arrested any of them recently?
uh, yeah. A few last month for a home invasion-petty stuff.
anybody in there sophisticated enough to pull off this morning's job?
maybe. There is a guy that specializes in high-end jobs.
we've watched him once before.
his name's Carl Raines. - Carl Raines?
Yeah. - All right, thanks.
this is Carl Raine" last known address.
wait a minute.
Hey, got a visual on our suspect. - That's him.
got a visual on our suspect.
he's headed for that truck. He's headed for that truck.
you got him? - Where's your partner? Where's your partner?!
why'd you kill Benjamin Paxton?
was... was paid.
paid by who?
he's gone. Damn it!
you heard him. Hired to kill Ben Paxton.
maybe we'll find something in here that'll tell us what Carl couldn't while he was still breathing.
I got a bunch of trash, a bunch of fast food wrappers.
you? - Yeah, I got something right here, actually.
in the crack of the seat.
it's a thumb drive.
let's see what we've got.
okay, looks like we got about a dozen files, all audio tracks.
wait, how come no lyrics?
Oh, wow, these must be the raw instrumentals.
these are never released to the public. Usually only the artists have access to these.
isaiah Stiles just got released on bail; he's our rapper. Can we link him to this?
maybe so. Let me pull up a music recognition database.
I'll have the computer run it against its own catalog, see if we get anything that pops.
turn it up a little bit.
we got an exact match to Stiles' latest album.
we just linked him to our shooter, Carl Raines.
time to bring Stiles back in.
the only people with access to these instrumentals are you and Carl Raines.
why'd you hire Raines to kill Paxton?
you got me sitting here 'cause of Carl? - Really?
we know he was involved in that robbery this morning.
so give it up, Stiles. How you know him?
he used to work for me.
a'ight, he was my bodyguard up until a couple weeks ago. Why?
why'd he used to work for you? Why'd you get rid of him?
he jacked those tracks from my house, so I fired his ass.
then he goes, he tries to blackmail me. You believe it? He tries to blackmail me.
why am I here, Carl?
I want 500K or I sell these beats before your album drops.
I ain't paying you a nickel, you pathetic little bitch.
see, I've got friends that'll put you six feet under if I say go.
are you threatening me?
not if you send some cash my way.
I think I got a better idea, Carl.
a better idea.
so you know what I do?
I leaked the album on the Internet the next day.
making his tracks worthless. - That's pretty clever.
maybe not.
all I know is that if Carl was involved, that explains this bullet in my arm.
no. Our evidence indicates he was there to kill Benjamin Paxton, not you.
Really? How you know he wasn't aiming for me and just missed?
how... How you know that for sure? - I know that it doesn't matter.
because Carl's dead.
I shot him.
you wanted to see me? - I heard one of the thieves got killed.
was it him? Was it the man who hurt my son?
we believe it was his partner.
so this guy's still out there?
I noticed you haven't posted bail yet.
well, I tried. All my bank accounts have been cleared out.
who else had access to that account?
ten K. Just like you said.
Kev, buddy, we've been over this.
it's 50K, not ten.
I'm so-I'm sorry. I-I thought you said ten.
you want to get in next week, you better bring me another envelope.
but I cleared my mom's bank accounts.
that's the last of her money. - That's my problem how?
charming.
we've been looking for you, Joey.
turn around. - Aw, what the hell is this?
illegal card games, stealing money from a kid-does that ring a bell?
go inside, Kevin.
so, you're taking advantage of the kid, letting him back in games.
he's in no condition to be gambling.
you're going to give him back every dime today.
I was just messing with him. I wasn't going to keep it.
you ever been to jail?
Hey, no sweat, all right? Pump the brakes.
what if I told you something about this morning's game? - I think you better.
there was another player at the game that wanted Paxton there.
and who was that?
the rapper, Isaiah Stiles.
he called me nonstop for two weeks about making sure Paxton was at the game.
I got a question. Why would a rapper want to kill a movie producer?
how should I know? I was just trying to get him to the game.
fold.
my man. You came through for me.
favors aren't free, all right?
here. Does that clear my balance?
I take cash only, hip-hop.
What'd you get for it?
he offered a diamond. A real flashy piece.
you got it on you?
do I look like a pawn shop? Cash only.
you can prove this, of course? - Yeah, I got half a dozen rants on my voice mail.
check it, Frank.
it's all here.
the guy was relentless. - Joseph, you don't know relentless.
this is harassment. You have absolutely no right to drag me back in here.
okay, why don't you have a seat? - My man Stiles.
Hey, listen to this.
yo, Joey, it's Stiles again.
listen, I know you've been ducking my calls, so let me remind you.
work your magic.
make sure Paxton's at that game and I'll make it worth your while, okay?
was that you?
kind of proves that you made sure Paxton was at a game where he was murdered.
all it proves is that I wanted him at the game.
Ooh-wee, you are shining, Stiles.
man, ooh, need some shades.
you mind if we take a look at your rings?
Why? It's the same rings I had on earlier.
all day? - All day.
you know what, just-just let her have a look then.
just a look. - Just a little peek.
thank you.
Oh, what, y'all do appraisals now?
you got jokes. - This one's clean.
like me.
well, see, now that's weird. This one's not.
this one has glass particles all over it.
which proves that you scored the glass at the hotel to help the robber.
you lied to me. You organized that robbery.
you ordered the murder of Benjamin Paxton, didn't you? Didn't you?!
you know what? - What?!
you set up the robbery and the murder. - No, you know what?
Paxton got exactly what he deserved after what he did to me. Okay?
the man hires me as the lead role in his movie, City Streets.
I made the soundtrack off my own dime-my own dime!
and then out of the blue, out of nowhere, he goes and fires me right before filming.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
my agent called me, said you replaced me with some British actor or something?
what's up, man? - Yeah, I'm going in a different direction.
different... This was my movie, my franchise.
your franchise?
Yeah, I already blew half a mil of my own cash prepping a soundtrack, doing...
Hey, whose fault is that?
you want the truth?
you never had the real edge I was looking for.
word got out about what he said.
doors started shutting.
my label dropped me. Fans turned on me.
all you got in this town is your rep.
that's it.
and Paxton took mine from me.
so you wanted to take everything from him.
what the hell you think?
I called some old friends, yeah.
they pointed me to the guy that was hitting those poker games around town, so I told him about today's poker game. I told him about the pot.
he says he wants in, I said I wanted a cut.
and you helped him by scoring the glass.
that way he could come in shooting, distract everyone and then his partner Carl Raines could shoot Paxton.
now see, you got it all wrong, sweetheart. I thought you were smart cops.
you see, he never even knew my boy Carl was in the vent.
they weren't partners? - No.
you double-crossed the robber.
you set the robber up to take the fall for Paxton's murder.
Ta-da.
it's like they do it in the movies.
you set somebody else up to take the fall.
you know, Paxton would have appreciated the irony.
Yeah, well, this isn't a movie. So give it up, snitch.
I want a name right now for the robber.
or else what?
or else I'll damage more than your little reputation.
you got it?
put your hands where I can see them, brother.
get 'em up. Turn around slowly.
you got to be kidding me.
Horatio, he was at the crime scene this morning. - Turn around.
all right, everybody back off. You're interfering with an investigation.
somebody die? - Hey, I said back off.
yo, that's Isaiah Stiles, the rapper.
best place to hide-in plain sight.
apparently not, Alonzo.
Stiles set me up. Made it look like I hit that producer.
I didn't hurt anyone; I never have.
Kevin Bowers. - What, am I supposed to know that name?
you should know his name because you took his whole life from him.
take him, Frank. - Let's go.
you are pathetic! I hope you...
we got it from here, all right? We'll take care of it.
go home, Mrs. Bowers.
go home.
is this where you rough me up, chief?
you know, that's really going to be up to you.
I want you to give that kid back every dime.
I don't do business that way.
you heard what I said. Every dime.
Kevin, baby, is that you?
I told you not to slam the door.
it's all here.
what is all this?
it's all the money I lost-your money.
second mortgage.
how did you do this?
I'm sorry for all this, Mom.
I just hope that this can make it right.
Oh, God, baby. You don't have to apologize.
I love you, no matter what.
you always remember that, ay?
tomorrow night, one of these lucky beauties will be named the overall winner!
Kierra, you're up next.
there's one down.
No! I don't want to wear the flipper!
Melrose, without it you get the runner-up ribbon;
with it you get the big crown.
I will give you one of your special treats.
two.
okay?
I feel like a bunny rabbit.
well, you look like a winner.
got to keep your energy up. Okay?
Oh, hey, Suze!
today might be our day.
good luck, sweetie.
all right!
next we welcome to the stage, Kierra!
Mr. Chambers, why is my age group now moved up to 3: 00?
Blakely is at her prime between 8: 00 and 11: 00 a. m.
well, my wife handles those aspects of the pageant.
Ow! Stop, Mommy! You're hurting me!
beauty is pain, baby.
if you want to beat Melrose, your hair has to be perfect.
and now welcome...
Tori! Go, honey. Go, honey.
go, Tori!
now we welcome to the stage - Come here, honey. Good job.
two-time Royal Azalea champion, Melrose!
Hi. I'm Melrose and I'm six.
my favorite color is magenta, and I want to be a ballerina when I grow up.
get it, girl!
hit those exes!
you are a star! Whoo!
Yeah! Work it!
good job, hon!
smile big! Smile!
say good-bye to Melrose!
you in here?
Mrs. Gramercy?
we're ready for Melrose in the beachwear lineup.
Mrs. Gramercy?
if you don't get downstairs in five minutes, you're gonna lose points.
mommy says I have to learn how to do my own makeup.
where is your mommy?
she's sleeping.
of course she is.
come on, let's get you out of here.
this woman was murdered while her six-year-old daughter was hiding in the bathroom, Tom.
did she see the killer?
that's yet to be determined.
Aha. There's my cause of death.
the spike penetrated the ocular cavity and passed into the frontal lobe.
caused intracranial bleeding.
seems to me like someone in the pageant wanted to send a message.
I think the message is clear: There are no winners today, Tom.
not today.
smile, Molly.
you know, even without the murder this is looking a little creepy.
you know, as a former pageant princess, I'd completely agree.
what?
Oh, I see it.
well, it's just like a rite of passage, you know, for Southern girls.
sort of like football is for boys.
we spent thousands of dollars getting Tori ready for this and you're canceling?
thousands? Thought the top prize was a $200 college savings bond.
excuse me, we're looking for the pageant director.
yours truly. Darla Chambers.
great. I'm Calleigh Duquesne, this is Ryan Wolfe.
we're with Miami-Dade Police Department.
excuse me, what about crowning?
my daughter was on track to win.
officers, you have to understand that our contestants, they spend months preparing for Royal Azalea, and their moms spend a lot of money.
I understand what you're saying.
it's just that one of your mothers was murdered.
what? Oh, my God.
Yeah, I hadn't made that announcement.
okay, ladies, I'm going to need you all to back up, please.
just back up. Thanks. Edwin!
you want me on mom patrol? Yeah.
ladies, I can try and get answers for all your questions.
there are complimentary refreshments in the banquet room. Follow me.
we're gonna need a list of all the contestants in the pageant.
and I see that you have video cameras taping the event.
Yes. It's for our Sizzle reel.
okay, we're going to need all of the footage.
I can get that for you. It's gonna take a little while.
as soon as possible.
do you know where the victim's family is?
right through that door. Okay.
so the two of you were staying in a separate room from Melrose and your mother?
Yeah, my mom likes to keep everything calm for her the night before the pageant.
is there anyone else who had a key?
absolutely not. No.
okay, Mr. Gramercy, I'd like to ask Melrose some questions, and it is our protocol to talk to a child separately in a neutral location away from the family.
keep her out of it. She's six years old.
I understand your concern. However, your wife was murdered, and we don't know what happened in that room.
it's best if Melrose spoke to a doctor.
okay.
Hey.
this nice lady is going to ask you some questions, okay?
but Hoppa, I want to be here when Mommy wakes up.
we're going to see about that, okay?
it's okay.
please look out for my daughter. I will.
let's go, sweetie.
you see this?
she doesn't even look real. She looks like a doll.
I don't understand why parents put kindergarteners through this.
just let kids be kids.
it's disgusting.
check this out.
it looks like a pink bead.
Yeah. Maybe it's from one of those dresses.
you see anything? That rack there.
no, I don't think it came from any of these.
well, if it didn't come from one of her dresses then maybe the killer tracked it in.
you said that this crown was already in the room, right?
Yeah. Melrose won it in her last pageant.
mommy brought it for motivation.
and this was used to stab her?
maybe someone thought Melrose didn't deserve the title and they decided to take it out on her mom.
Sam O. I got something.
Oh, way to go, Simmons.
was that supposed to be funny?
well, seeing that you're holding biological evidence in the trace lab
I figured you came in here for an ego boost.
Oh, no. Always appreciated, but I'm good.
you see, this hair has no follicle.
Ah, so no DNA.
Yes, which is why I came to you.
are you thinking a drug test? - I'm hoping if we can find any prescriptions, then we can cross-check it against the other registrants at the pageant.
Yeah, but for that kind of analysis, I usually have several strands to work with.
I know. Isn't it funny? But you can do it!
it worked.
your hair shows me that the only drug this person ingested is Isotretinoin.
and what's that?
prescription acne medication.
so, most likely from a teenager.
Jan, we found a strand of your hair on the murder weapon.
you told the police earlier you were never in that room.
well, I wasn't.
Oh. My hair was. Your what?
Yeah, my mom -- she makes me grow out my hair so she can cut it off and use it to make Melrose's wiglet.
a wiglet?
Oh, it's a little hairpiece, makes her hair look fuller.
are you always that generous with your sister?
I had my chance, winning crowns and stuff.
I hit puberty, and, well, it was Melrose's turn.
were you angry about that? No.
my mom liked the pageants more than I did anyway.
you still go every weekend to cheer on Melrose.
look...
we're a close family.
you know, if you want to find her killer, you really should look at the other kids' moms.
they're competitive. They're crazy.
especially this one woman, Alicia Haverford.
Melrose beat her daughter in the last four pageants.
she was beyond pissed.
so, Haverford's here in 107.
Yeah, she must be crazy competitive.
just open your mouth. - No! No! No! No!
Hey, Miami-Dade!
Miami-Dade Police! Open the door! - Mommy!
what's going on? What are you doing here?
what are you doing?! What's going on in here?
what is happening?
are you okay, honey? - I was just bleaching Tori's teeth.
you're just bleaching her teeth. She's six years old.
mommy says beauty is pain.
they're just baby teeth. What...?
we're gonna get her some real great caps when she's ready.
this says 16 and up.
you know, what you're doing, lady, is borderline child abuse.
everybody here does it.
great, well, then, I'll have Child Protective Services start with you.
is she doing anything else that's hurting you, or that you don't like?
these pins she pokes into my hair.
they hurt my head.
I bet they do. Well, you know what? I'll just take them, okay?
and what about this? What about this?
no, that one's my favorite.
I hope you plan to reimburse me for those.
Yeah, I don't because they're part of a crime scene.
every single thing in this room is evidence in a murder investigation.
uh, sweetie, why don't you go brush your teeth?
okay.
okay.
Why? Am I a suspect?
the hotel's computer key log system has you leaving your room at 2: 43 a. m. and Suzanne Gramercy's door opening at 2: 45.
must have been around the time I went to get some ice.
Really? Because I found a bead just like this one at the murder scene.
well, I didn't want to speak ill of the dead.
why don't you try the truth?
Suzanne tried to sabotage Tori.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Melrose is sleeping. - You ripped Tori's dress.
I didn't touch your cheap costume.
cheap? This dress cost five grand.
it's custom.
look, Melrose is taking that crown.
don't go counting your chickens yet.
we've got a backup outfit.
Oh, would you just get out?
get out before I call security. Go!
And?
and then I went back to bed.
you sure? Because the door never fully closed.
Oh, please.
I would never kill someone over a Regional.
sweetie, I need to leave the room for a minute, okay?
please don't leave.
how about this?
do you see that mirror right there?
it's actually a window.
and I'm just gonna be on the other side of it, and I can see you the whole time.
but I won't be able to see you.
that's a good point.
I'll tell you what.
why don't you hold my necklace for me, okay?
okay.
it's very delicate.
this way you'll know I'll be right back.
it matches your shirt. - Thank you.
medically, Melrose appears to be unharmed.
thank goodness. - But I think she knows more than she understands.
do you think she witnessed the murder? - I can't say for sure.
I'd like to revisit this morning's events with her.
my job is to listen to kids.
and today, my job is to listen to you.
okay.
now, I have some rules.
if I ask you a question, and you don't know, just say, "I don't know."
think you can do that?
okay.
now, what's my favorite color?
I don't know.
that's exactly right.
you don't know my favorite color, so, "I don't know" is the right thing to say.
what do you remember about the last time you saw your mommy today?
she fell down.
and then what happened?
I got scared, and I closed the door.
to the bathroom?
and then I did my makeup.
did someone say angry words to your mommy before she fell?
I don't know.
did anyone hurt your mommy?
do you know who that person was?
it was Hoppa.
Tripp, it's Calleigh.
I need you to bring in Melrose Gramercy's father.
have a seat, Mr. Gramercy.
sit.
what's going on?
this year, you and your wife spent $60, 000 on the pageants.
that's more than half the annual income from your garage.
you - You checked our tax returns?
you wasted your hard-earned paycheck on tiaras and ball gowns for a six-year-old?
Yeah, that has to be a little aggravating.
I wasn't happy about it.
you ever fight about it?
occasionally. Did it ever get ugly?
you think I killed Suzanne.
you told us the last time you saw her was about 8: 30 last night?
that's right. - That's a lie.
your daughter put you in your wife's room several hours later.
she also said that you hurt Suzanne.
I thought Melrose was asleep.
can you please tell me why my credit card was denied today?
I canceled it. What?
how is Melrose gonna win this pageant without the Deluxe Confetti Avalanche at the end of her runway strut?
$250 for a bunch of cut-up paper.
they are flower petals.
I can buy 20 of these for $250.
well, you obviously don't care about making your daughter happy.
I had no idea she heard all that.
how far did you take it?
I raised my voice. That's it.
are these the tapes from the sizzle reel? All 263 of them.
okay, let's pull up all the images of Suzanne Gramercy.
if this was, in fact, a premeditated murder, maybe we can catch someone on tape stalking her.
okay.
and there's Suzanne in the lobby.
Hey, Ryan, why do all these images have snow around them?
do you see that?
Oh, when the videotape is paused or freeze-framed, the tape gets damaged.
so, are you telling me that people have reviewed these tapes and paused where these images are?
Yeah. - Can you find other artifacts?
Yeah, sure.
it's every image of Suzanne Gramercy.
it's as if the person is studying her.
wait. So, you're thinking that the killer had access to these tapes?
maybe.
well, here's Suzanne right here -- no artifact.
Ryan, see if you can find an image of Melrose without Suzanne in it.
all right.
there's one of her alone.
look at how blurry it becomes.
I'm starting to think the focus wasn't on Suzanne.
no. I think our killer was after Melrose.
maybe Suzanne died protecting her daughter.
Delko. Hey, it's me.
listen, do you know where Melrose Gramercy is?
she's here in MDPD with her father.
keep an eye on her for me, would you?
you know what I say when it comes to kids?
Yeah. Trust no one. I know.
Calleigh? Hang on, Eric. What?
take a look at this. I found another artifact.
Melrose wasn't the only little girl being watched.
this one, too. Oh, my God.
Eric, get to Tori Haverford's room right away.
I think she's our killer's next target.
all right. Hey, watch her.
don't take your eyes off of her.
Tori! Tori! Mrs. Haverford!
what is it? What's going on?
Where's Tori? Where's your daughter?
she's in the room, napping.
open the door. Open the door now.
stay back. Stay back! Tori!
Where's my daughter? Tori! Tori?
Tori?! She's not here.
she was sleeping in that bed ten minutes...
well, she's not here right now, okay?
please, where is she?!
we're gonna find her.
this is CSI Eric Delko. I have a critical missing:
Tori Haverford, six years old, brown hair, green eyes.
she was last seen at the Casa Bena Hotel, room 107.
send search-and-rescue dogs here.
I need an Amber alert put out right away.
I don't understand.
just 'cause I organized the pageant, you think I know where Tori is?
they are your promotional tapes.
whoever watched them was targeting Tori.
so, who had access?
you think that I'm somehow responsible?
did you give someone the tapes? Oh, so ridiculous!
you know what I'm doing? I'm calling my lawyer.
great. In fact, I will scroll through your contacts myself, because I'm sure whoever you let watch the tape is in here.
you know you have no right.
I have probable cause.
I am focused.
you sure? - Oh, I'm sure.
I'm sure you're gonna like this.
I can't wait to see it.
who's a pretty girl?
head and shoulders, knees and toes.
Oh, my God.
it's your husband.
you're helping him.
Where's your husband, Darla?
where did he take Tori?
sweetie, this is where I insist on a lawyer...
right now.
go.
edwin Chambers! MDPD!
clear. - It's empty.
listen, I found something in the backyard. You need to see it.
the yard, it looks like it ends here, but it doesn't.
what is this?
this is set up for a little girl.
it's a jail cell.
this is Tori's.
she was here.
so where is she now?
okay, how about if I take the house and you take the tent?
Yeah, there should be something in there that will lead us to where he took Tori.
Oh, no, Tori's mom's here.
I'll go take care of it.
I'm sorry, ma'am. You can't pass. - Excuse me.
what are you doing here?! - I had to come here.
I need to know... My baby!
no, no, no, no. Tori is not here. That's just evidence.
she's not here. We're still looking for her. You don't understand.
she's never spent the night without me. I need to do something.
well, what you can do is you can give me the pictures that we asked you for earlier.
that would be very helpful.
Mrs. Haverford, this is not what Tori looks like right now.
do you have a picture of your little girl that your little girl actually looks like?
is this okay?
this is perfect. Thank you.
I - I just...
this is my fault, isn't it?
I put her on display.
I'll be honest. It - it made it easier.
but you're not the criminal here.
the person who took her is.
and I promise you we are doing everything that we can. I promise you.
Jan, we found your fingerprints on this box at the Chambers' house.
Oh, well, that's impossible.
I was never there.
Jan... it was your fingerprint.
but it was smaller... like a child's.
please... I just don't want to talk about it.
what is it, Jan?
did - Did Edward Chambers kidnap you when you were little?
it's vague and it's mixed up.
I just don't know what happened.
Jan, anything you can remember may help lead us to Tori.
I can't remember.
I'm so sorry. I just can't.
so, you and your husband used the pageants as a hunting ground.
save the accusations, Lieutenant.
my client was a victim of Edwin Chambers as well.
he would have killed me.
I'm a survivor.
Yes. Have the State Attorney grant her immunity and she'll cooperate.
a six-year-old girl is missing, and you're working for a deal.
I've seen the video of the girls on your phone.
do you know what they do to a pedophile in prison?
don't listen to him, Darla.
they're gonna tear you into little pieces.
where is your husband?
there's a place that he likes to go on Tuesday afternoon.
tuesday afternoon. Where would that be?
I don't know, I don't know.
it's his private place.
I think Edwin Chambers left these smudges on the murder weapon. I'll run an analysis.
maybe it'll lead us to where he's keeping Tori.
hold on a second.
these marks weren't there before.
is it makeup?
well, we found this tanning gun at the crime scene, so my guess is that it's bronzer.
bronzer darkens over time, which is why we haven't seen it till now.
Yeah, Wolfe, but how is that even possible?
dha darkens skin cells by reacting with its amino acids and proteins.
this is cotton. It's the sweat in the lining.
it contains a protein which reacts with DHA.
Loman. Hey, Doc, it's Walter.
are you close to Suzanne Gramercy's body? - Yes.
could you check it out for me? - Anything specific?
Uh-huh, her hands. - Okay.
does it look like she's been using bronzer?
her right hand does have some dark markings on it.
honestly, I don't know how I could have missed this earlier.
not even your fault. Don't worry about it. They're just starting to show now.
do you need me?
Hey, hey...
are you with Melrose right now? What do you need?
does it look like there was bronzer applied to her?
it does on half her neck, her arms and her hands.
mmm-hmm, back of her hands? Yes.
is this important?
maybe. Uh, I'm working a theory here. I'll get back with you. Thanks.
so, uh, what's up?
Suzanne had to be murdered while she was applying bronzer to Melrose.
okay, so you're saying that her attacker would also have bronzer residue?
no, no, you're totally missing the point.
look at the crown's lining. There's voids in the bronzer.
Oh, yeah.
they're too small to be fingers.
unless...
we're not talking about adult fingers.
sweetie, will you just hold this for me?
do you want to talk about it?
come here. It's okay.
it wasn't your fault.
what's going on?
daddy...
there's a reason why Melrose saw your wife fall.
what's that mean?
I made Mommy fall down.
Melrose, stop jumping around. Stop!
you are not behaving like a winner.
don't you want to win? No!
it's stinky!
don't you want to win another one of these?
now, let me make you pretty!
I don't want to be pretty!
Melrose Princess Gramercy!
Melrose Princess Gramercy!
I didn't mean to hurt her.
Oh, hey, I know that.
hey...
I know that. It's okay.
what happens now?
it was an accident, Larry.
it was a tragic accident.
we'll close the case.
so you're sure?
Melrose isn't in trouble? No, she's not.
but there's another little girl who's still out there.
look...
I'm sorry. I wish I could help you.
but I have no memory of who took me, or where. It's blank.
I have a specialist here who may be able to work with you.
God, what makes you think it would even work?
I'm not sure it's going to work.
but if it does, we can save this child.
look, you can ask me what he did to me a thousand times.
I just can't remember.
your father says he remembers you went missing for a few hours during one of your pageants.
do you remember that?
that time I got lost.
it's like shock therapy.
the doctor's trick is to not dwell on the perpetrator.
when did you know you were going to be okay?
when I saw my mom and dad.
when you were lost, what did you see?
it was dark.
there was this little light. We'll have fun.
it was... like a flicker.
please...
and...
I kept trying to move my hands, my special friend.
but I couldn't, because they were tied.
and he had these gloves.
we'll have fun.
white, fuzzy gloves.
that doesn't sound like latex gloves.
gardening, maybe?
the room you were in, was it a house? No.
it wasn't a house. My special friend...
it was cold.
and it smelled.
like what? Like...
like butter, or...
or oil. - Butter or oil?
do you think that's... Popcorn.
that would explain the butter smell.
and Eric found popcorn stuck to candy wrappers at the Chambers' house.
and what about the man that was with you?
quiet.
the man... had this pet mouse.
quiet.
but it wasn't like a normal mouse, it was...
will you be my friend? It was big.
do you recall anything else about that day?
the man...
he was looking through this little window.
my special friend...
there was this clicking noise.
and I was trying to undo my ties.
but I was scared, I was so scared that he was going to come back.
clicking could be a film projector.
and maybe he was looking through a window in a projection booth.
and projectionists wear gloves to protect the film.
a movie theater.
you did really good, honey.
you're really going to like this movie.
I went over Chambers' work history.
there's no record of him being a projectionist, ticket taker, usher, candy vendor, nothing.
Really? So then why a theater?
these are all the theaters in the area? - Mm-hmm.
in a 20-mile radius of the Chambers' house.
there were two movies with cartoon mice out ten years ago.
these are the screens they played on.
I don't get it. How would you hide a child during work hours?
it would be hard, right? Yeah.
wait. Wait, wait, wait. What?
Chambers' wife told Horatio he went to a... special place on Tuesdays.
okay.
that one. It's closed on Tuesdays.
Yeah, that's it. That's where he's got Tori. Thanks.
Horatio. Yeah, I got an address.
so how's my sweet little friend?
this is playtime.
okay?
I'm going to undo your chains, now, and we're going to play, okay?
all my friends like to play.
no. - We'll have fun.
No! No, let me go! It's time to play.
you know what? You're so pretty when you cry.
that's enough, I've had it.
everything stops right now. Right now!
no, let me go! - It's our special moment, Tori.
No!
fine, just sit. I want Mommy.
I'll be right back.
the thing is... I don't mean to.
it's just that bad luck follows me around wherever I go.
bad luck? Is that all?
man, listen to what you're saying...
my special friend took me here when I was your age.
I brought you some treats.
now, I'm going to ask you one last time...
will you be my friend?
no. I want to be your friend.
get away from that girl.
no, no, no! No!
you let me out of here, right now, or she gets it.
right now!
I mean it! I will kill her!
that's not necessary.
you know what, Edwin? Go ahead.
go. Go!
stay with the girl.
I got her.
are you okay, sweetheart?
he didn't hurt you, did he?
what's going on here?
am I gonna get shot?
you are not going to get shot. You are going to be fine, okay?
I promise I am going to make sure that you're safe.
did you see where he put the key? No.
Oh, I got it. I got it. I got it.
this is a little trick that I learned a long time ago.
all right.
that's far enough, Edwin!
here we go. We got it, we got it.
you're all right, sweetie.
okay.
sweetie, come here with me.
I want Mommy. - I got you, baby, I got you.
I'm sorry, okay?
I can change, I know I can.
none of us changes that much.
I think you're going to fall.
then you gotta help me!
do I?
Ah! Come on!
tomorrow night, one of these lucky beauties will be named the overall winner!??
Kierra, you're up next.
there's one down.
No! I don't want to wear the flipper!
Melrose, without it you get the runner-up ribbon;
with it you get the big crown.
I will give you one of your special treats.
two.
okay?
I feel like a bunny rabbit.
well, you look like a winner.
got to keep your energy up. Okay?
Oh, hey, Suze!
today might be our day. Good luck, sweetie.
all right!
next we welcome to the stage, Kierra!
Mr. Chambers, why is my age group now moved up to 3: 00?
Blakely is at her prime between 8: 00 and 11: 00 a. m.
well, my wife handles those aspects of the pageant.
stop, Mommy! You're hurting me!
beauty is pain, baby.
if you want to beat Melrose, your hair has to be perfect.
and now welcome... Tori!
go, honey. Go, honey.
I'm Melrose and I'm six.
my favorite color is magenta, and I want to be a ballerina when I grow up.
get it, girl! Hit those exes!
you are a star!
say good-bye to Melrose!
you in here?
Mrs. Gramercy?
we're ready for Melrose in the beachwear lineup.
Mrs. Gramercy?
if you don't get downstairs in five minutes, you're gonna lose points.
mommy says I have to learn how to do my own makeup.
where is your mommy? - She's sleeping.
of course she is.
come on, let's get you out of here.
this woman was murdered while her six-year-old daughter was hiding in the bathroom, Tom.
did she see the killer?
that's yet to be determined.
there's my cause of death.
the spike penetrated the ocular cavity and passed into the frontal lobe.
caused intracranial bleeding.
seems to me like someone in the pageant wanted to send a message.
there are no winners today, Tom. Not today.
smile, Molly.
you know, even without the murder this is looking a little creepy.
you know, as a former pageant princess, I'd completely agree.
what? Oh, I see it.
well, it's just like a rite of passage, you know, for Southern girls.
sort of like football is for boys.
we spent thousands of dollars getting Tori ready for this and you're canceling?
thousands?
thought the top prize was a $200 college savings bond.
excuse me, we're looking for the pageant director.
yours truly. Darla Chambers.
great. I'm Calleigh Duquesne, this is Ryan Wolfe.
we're with Miami-Dade Police Department.
excuse me, what about crowning? My daughter was on track to win.
officers, you have to understand that our contestants, they spend months preparing for Royal Azalea, and their moms spend a lot of money.
I understand what you're saying. It's just that one of your mothers was murdered.
what? - Oh, my God.
Yeah, I hadn't made that announcement.
okay, ladies, I'm going to need you all to back up, please. Just back up. Thanks.
you want me on mom patrol? - Yeah.
ladies, I can try and get answers for all your questions.
there are complimentary refreshments in the banquet room. Follow me.
we're gonna need a list of all the contestants in the pageant.
and I see that you have video cameras taping the event.
Yes. It's for our Sizzle reel.
okay, we're going to need all of the footage.
I can get that for you. It's gonna take a little while.
as soon as possible.
do you know where the victim's family is?
right through that door.
okay.
so the two of you were staying in a separate room from Melrose and your mother?
Yeah, my mom likes to keep everything calm for her the night before the pageant.
is there anyone else who had a key?
absolutely not. - No.
okay, Mr. Gramercy, I'd like to ask Melrose some questions, and it is our protocol to talk to a child separately in a neutral location away from the family.
keep her out of it. She's six years old.
I understand your concern.
however, your wife was murdered, and we don't know what happened in that room.
it's best if Melrose spoke to a doctor.
okay.
this nice lady is going to ask you some questions, okay?
but Poppa, I want to be here when Mommy wakes up.
we're going to see about that, okay?
it's okay.
please look out for my daughter.
I will.
let's go, sweetie.
you see this?
she doesn't even look real. She looks like a doll.
I don't understand why parents put kindergarteners through this.
just let kids be kids.
it's disgusting.
check this out.
it looks like a pink bead.
Yeah. Maybe it's from one of those dresses. You see anything?
that rack there.
no, I don't think it came from any of these.
well, if it didn't come from one of her dresses then maybe the killer tracked it in.
you said that this crown was already in the room, right?
Yeah. Melrose won it in her last pageant.
mommy brought it for motivation.
and this was used to stab her?
maybe someone thought Melrose didn't deserve the title and they decided to take it out on her mom.
I got something.
Oh, way to go, Simmons.
was that supposed to be funny?
well, seeing that you're holding biological evidence in the trace lab
I figured you came in here for an ego boost.
Oh, no. Always appreciated, but I'm good.
you see, this hair has no follicle.
Ah, so no DNA.
Yes, which is why I came to you.
are you thinking a drug test?
I'm hoping if we can find any prescriptions, then we can cross-check it against the other registrants at the pageant.
Yeah, but for that kind of analysis, I usually have several strands to work with.
I know. Isn't it funny?
but you can do it!
it worked.
your hair shows me that the only drug this person ingested is Isotretinoin.
and what's that?
prescription acne medication.
so, most likely from a teenager.
Jan, we found a strand of your hair on the murder weapon.
you told the police earlier you were never in that room.
well, I wasn't.
my hair was. - Your what?
Yeah, my mom-she makes me grow out my hair so she can cut it off and use it to make Melrose's wiglet.
a wiglet?
Oh, it's a little hairpiece, makes her hair look fuller.
are you always that generous with your sister?
I had my chance, winning crowns and stuff.
I hit puberty, and, well, it was Melrose's turn.
were you angry about that? - No.
my mom liked the pageants more than I did anyway.
you still go every weekend to cheer on Melrose.
look... we're a close family.
you know, if you want to find her killer, you really should look at the other kids' moms.
they're competitive. - They're crazy.
especially this one woman, Alicia Haverford.
Melrose beat her daughter in the last four pageants.
she was beyond pissed.
so, Haverford's here in 107.
Yeah, she must be crazy competitive.
No! No! No! No!
Hey, Miami-Dade!
what's going on? What are you doing here? What are you doing?!
what's going on in here?
what is happening? Are you okay, honey?
I was just bleaching Tori's teeth.
you're just bleaching her teeth. She's six years old.
mommy says beauty is pain.
they're just baby teeth. - What...?
we're gonna get her some real great caps when she's ready.
this says 16 and up.
you know, what you're doing, lady, is borderline child abuse.
everybody here does it.
great, well, then, I'll have Child Protective Services start with you.
is she doing anything else that's hurting you, or that you don't like?
these pins she pokes into my hair. They hurt my head.
I bet they do. Well, you know what? I'll just take them, okay?
and what about this? What about this?
no, that one's my favorite.
I hope you plan to reimburse me for those.
Yeah, I don't because they're part of a crime scene.
every single thing in this room is evidence in a murder investigation.
uh, sweetie, why don't you go brush your teeth?
okay.
Why? Am I a suspect?
the hotel's computer key log system has you leaving your room at 2: 43 a. m. and Suzanne Gramercy's door opening at 2: 45.
must have been around the time I went to get some ice.
Really?
because I found a bead just like this one at the murder scene.
well, I didn't want to speak ill of the dead.
why don't you try the truth?
Suzanne tried to sabotage Tori.
Hey, hey, what are you doing? Melrose is sleeping.
you ripped Tori's dress.
I didn't touch your cheap costume.
cheap? This dress cost five grand. It's custom.
look, Melrose is taking that crown.
don't go counting your chickens yet.
we've got a backup outfit.
Oh, would you just get out? Get out before I call security. Go!
And?
and then I went back to bed.
you sure?
because the door never fully closed.
Oh, please.
I would never kill someone over a Regional.
sweetie, I need to leave the room for a minute, okay?
please don't leave.
how about this?
do you see that mirror right there?
it's actually a window.
and I'm just gonna be on the other side of it, and I can see you the whole time.
but I won't be able to see you.
that's a good point.
I'll tell you what.
why don't you hold my necklace for me, okay?
okay.
it's very delicate.
this way you'll know I'll be right back.
it matches your shirt. - Thank you.
medically, Melrose appears to be unharmed.
thank goodness.
but I think she knows more than she understands.
do you think she witnessed the murder?
I can't say for sure.
I'd like to revisit this morning's events with her.
my job is to listen to kids.
and today, my job is to listen to you.
okay.
now, I have some rules.
if I ask you a question, and you don't know, just say,"I don't know.
think you can do that?
okay.
now, what's my favorite color?
I don't know.
that's exactly right.
you don't know my favorite color, so,"I don't know" is the right thing to say.
what do you remember about the last time you saw your mommy today?
she fell down.
and then what happened?
I got scared, and I closed the door.
to the bathroom?
and then I did my makeup.
did someone say angry words to your mommy before she fell?
I don't know.
did anyone hurt your mommy?
do you know who that person was?
it was Poppa.
Tripp, it's Calleigh. Go pick up Melrose's father.
have a seat, Mr. Gramercy. - Sit.
what's going on?
this year, you and your wife spent $60, 000 on the pageants.
that's more than half the annual income from your garage.
you-you checked our tax returns?
you wasted your hard-earned paycheck on tiaras and ball gowns for a six-year-old?
Yeah, that has to be a little aggravating.
I wasn't happy about it.
you ever fight about it? - Occasionally.
did it ever get ugly?
you think I killed Suzanne.
you told us the last time you saw her was about 8: 30 last night?
that's right. - That's a lie.
your daughter put you in your wife's room several hours later.
she also said that you hurt Suzanne.
I thought Melrose was asleep.
can you please tell me why my credit card was denied today?
I canceled it. - What?
how is Melrose gonna win this pageant without the Deluxe Confetti Avalanche at the end of her runway strut?
$250 for a bunch of cut-up paper.
they are flower petals.
I can buy 20 of these for $250.
well, you obviously don't care about making your daughter happy.
I had no idea she heard all that.
how far did you take it?
I raised my voice. That's it.
are these the tapes from the sizzle reel?
all 263 of them.
okay, let's pull up all the images of Suzanne Gramercy.
if this was, in fact, a premeditated murder, maybe we can catch someone on tape stalking her.
okay.
and there's Suzanne in the lobby.
Hey, Ryan, why do all these images have snow around them? Do you see that?
Oh, when the videotape is paused or freeze-framed, the tape gets damaged.
so, are you telling me that people have reviewed these tapes and paused where these images are?
Yeah.
can you find other artifacts? - Yeah, sure.
it's every image of Suzanne Gramercy.
it's as if the person is studying her.
wait. So, you're thinking that the killer had access to these tapes?
maybe.
well, here's Suzanne right here-no artifact.
Ryan, see if you can find an image of Melrose without Suzanne in it.
all right.
there's one of her alone.
look at how blurry it becomes.
I'm starting to think the focus wasn't on Suzanne.
no. I think our killer was after Melrose.
maybe Suzanne died protecting her daughter.
Hey, it's me. Listen, do you know where Melrose Gramercy is?
she's here in MDPD with her father.
keep an eye on her for me, would you?
you know what I say when it comes to kids?
Yeah. Trust no one. I know.
Calleigh? - Hang on, Eric. What?
take a look at this. I found another artifact.
Melrose wasn't the only little girl being watched. This one, too.
Oh, my God. Eric, get to Tori Haverford's room right away.
I think she's our killer's next target. - All right.
Hey, watch her. Don't take your eyes off of her.
Mrs. Haverford! - What is it? What's going on?
Where's Tori? Where's your daughter? - She's in the room, napping.
open the door. Open the door now.
stay back. Stay back! Tori!
Where's my daughter? Tori!
she's not here. She was sleeping in that bed ten minutes...
well, she's not here right now, okay? - Please, where is she?!
Tori! Tori! - We're gonna find her.
this is CSI Eric Delko. I have a critical missing:
Tori Haverford, six years old, brown hair, green eyes.
she was last seen at the Casa Bena Hotel, room 107.
send search-and-rescue dogs here.
I need an Amber alert put out right away.
I don't understand. Just 'cause I organized the pageant, you think I know where Tori is?
they are your promotional tapes.
whoever watched them was targeting Tori. So, who had access?
you think that I'm somehow responsible?
did you give someone the tapes?
Oh, so ridiculous! You know what I'm doing? I'm calling my lawyer.
great. In fact, I will scroll through your contacts myself, because I'm sure whoever you let watch the tape is in here.
you know you have no right. - I have probable cause.
I am focused. - You sure?
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure you're gonna like this.
I can't wait to see it.
who's a pretty girl??
head and shoulders, knees and toes.
Oh, my God.
it's your husband. You're helping him.
Where's your husband, Darla?
where did he take Tori?
sweetie, this is where I insist on a lawyer... right now.
go.
edwin Chambers! MDPD!
clear. It's empty.
Hey! Listen, I found something in the backyard.
you need to see it.
the yard, it looks like it ends here, but it doesn't.
what is this?
this is set up for a little girl.
it's a jail cell.
this is Tori's.
she was here.
so where is she now?
okay, how about if I take the house and you take the tent?
Yeah, there should be something in there that will lead us to where he took Tori.
Oh, no, Tori's mom's here. I'll go take care of it.
I'm sorry, ma'am. You can't pass. - Excuse me.
what are you doing here?! - I had to come here.
I need to know... My baby!
no, no, no, no. Tori is not here.
that's just evidence. She's not here. We're still looking for her.
you don't understand. She's never spent the night without me.
I need to do something.
well, what you can do is you can give me the pictures that we asked you for earlier.
that would be very helpful.
Mrs. Haverford, this is not what Tori looks like right now.
do you have a picture of your little girl that your little girl actually looks like?
is this okay?
this is perfect. Thank you.
I-I just... This is my fault, isn't it?
I put her on display.
I'll be honest. It-it made it easier.
but you're not the criminal here.
the person who took her is.
and I promise you we are doing everything that we can. I promise you.
Jan, we found your fingerprints on this box at the Chambers' house.
Oh, well, that's impossible. I was never there.
Jan... it was your fingerprint.
but it was smaller... like a child's.
please...
I just don't want to talk about it.
what is it, Jan? Did-Did Edward Chambers kidnap you when you were little?
it's vague and it's mixed up.
I just don't know what happened.
Jan, anything you can remember may help lead us to Tori.
I can't remember.
I'm so sorry. I just can't.
so, you and your husband used the pageants as a hunting ground.
save the accusations, Lieutenant. My client was a victim of Edwin Chambers as well.
he would have killed me. I'm a survivor.
Yes. Have the State Attorney grant her immunity and she'll cooperate.
a six-year-old girl is missing, and you're working for a deal.
I've seen the video of the girls on your phone.
do you know what they do to a pedophile in prison? - Don't listen to him, Darla.
they're gonna tear you into little pieces.
where is your husband?
there's a place that he likes to go on Tuesday afternoon.
tuesday afternoon. Where would that be?
I don't know, I don't know. It's his private place.
I think Edwin Chambers left these smudges on the murder weapon.
I'll run an analysis. Maybe it'll lead us to where he's keeping Tori.
hold on a second.
these marks weren't there before.
is it makeup?
well, we found this tanning gun at the crime scene, so my guess is that it's bronzer.
bronzer darkens over time, which is why we haven't seen it till now.
Yeah, Wolfe, but how is that even possible?
dha darkens skin cells by reacting with its amino acids and proteins.
this is cotton. - It's the sweat in the lining.
it contains a protein which reacts with DHA.
Loman. - Hey, Doc, it's Walter.
are you close to Suzanne Gramercy's body? - Yes.
could you check it out for me? - Sure. Do you know where?
Uh-huh, her hands. - Okay.
does it look like she's been using bronzer?
her right hand does have some dark markings on it.
honestly, I don't know how I could have missed this earlier.
not even your fault. Don't worry about it. They're just starting to show now.
do you need me?
are you with Melrose right now?
what do you need?
does it look like there was bronzer applied to her?
it does on half her neck, her arms and her hands.
mmm-hmm, back of her hands? - Yes. Is this important?
maybe. Uh, I'm working a theory here. I'll get back with you. Thanks.
so, uh, what's up?
Suzanne had to be murdered while she was applying bronzer to Melrose.
okay, so you're saying that her attacker would also have bronzer residue?
no, no, you're totally missing the point. Look at the crown's lining.
there's voids in the bronzer.
they're too small to be fingers.
unless...
we're not talking about adult fingers.
sweetie, will you... just hold this for me?
do you want to talk about it?
come here.
it's okay.
it wasn't your fault.
what's going on? - Daddy...
there's a reason why Melrose saw your wife fall.
what's that mean?
I made Mommy fall down.
Melrose, stop jumping around.
you are not behaving like a winner. Don't you want to win?
No! It's stinky!
Melrose... Don't you want to win another one of these?
now, let me make you pretty!
I don't want to be pretty!
I didn't mean to hurt her.
Oh, hey, I know that.
I know that. It's okay.
what happens now?
it was an accident, Larry.
it was a tragic accident.
we'll close the case.
so you're sure? Melrose isn't in trouble?
no, she's not. But there's another little girl who's still out there.
look... I'm sorry.
I wish I could help you.
but I have no memory of who took me, or where. It's blank.
I have a specialist here who may be able to work with you.
God, what makes you think it would even work?
I'm not sure it's going to work. But if it does, we can save this child.
look, you can ask me what he did to me a thousand times. I just can't remember.
your father says he remembers you went missing for a few hours during one of your pageants.
do you remember that?
that time I got lost.
it's like shock therapy. - .
the doctor's trick is to not dwell on the perpetrator.
when did you know you were going to be okay?
when I saw my mom and dad.
when you were lost, what did you see?
it was dark.
there was this little light.
we'll have fun.
it was... like a flicker.
please...
and...
I kept trying to move my hands, My special friend.
but I couldn't, because they were tied.
and he had these gloves.
we'll have fun.
white, fuzzy gloves.
that doesn't sound like latex gloves. Gardening, maybe?
the room you were in, was it a house? - No.
it wasn't a house.
it was cold. And it smelled.
like what? - Like... like butter, or... or oil.
butter or oil? Do you think that's...
popcorn.
that would explain the butter smell.
and Eric found popcorn stuck to candy wrappers at the Chambers' house.
and what about the man that was with you?
quiet.
the man... had this pet mouse.
quiet.
but it wasn't like a normal mouse, it was...
will you be my friend?
it was big.
do you recall anything else about that day?
the man...
he was looking through this little window.
my special friend...
there was this clicking noise.
and I was trying to undo my ties.
but I was scared, I was so scared that he was going to come back.
clicking could be a film projector.
and maybe he was looking through a window in a projection booth.
and projectionists wear gloves to protect the film.
a movie theater.
you did really good, honey.
you're really going to like this movie.
I went over Chambers' work history.
there's no record of him being a projectionist, ticket taker, usher, candy vendor, nothing.
Really? So then why a theater?
these are all the theaters in the area?
in a 20-mile radius of the Chambers' house.
there were two movies with cartoon mice out ten years ago. These are the screens they played on.
I don't get it. How would you hide a child during work hours?
it would be hard, right?
wait. Wait, wait, wait.
what?
Chambers' wife told Horatio he went to a... special place on Tuesdays.
that one. It's closed on Tuesdays.
Yeah, that's it. That's where he's got Tori. Thanks.
Horatio. Yeah, I got an address.
so how's my sweet little friend?
this is playtime. Okay?
I'm going to undo your chains, now, and we're going to play, okay?
all my friends like to play. - No.
we'll have fun. It's time to play. - No! No, let me go!
you know what? You're so pretty when you cry.
that's enough, I've had it. Everything stops right now. Right now!
no, let me go! No!
fine, just sit. - I want Mommy.
I'll be right back.
I don't mean to.
it's just that bad luck follows me around wherever I go.
bad luck? Is that all?
man, listen to what you're saying...
my special friend took me here when I was your age.
I brought you some treats.
now, I'm going to ask you one last time...
will you be my friend? - No.
I want to be your friend.
get away from that girl.
no, no, no! No!
you let me out of here, right now, or she gets it.
right now! I mean it! I will kill her!
Edwin... That's not necessary.
you know what, Edwin? Go ahead.
go. Go!
stay with the girl. - I got her.
are you okay, sweetheart? He didn't hurt you, did he?
what's going on here?
am I gonna get shot?
you are not going to get shot. You are going to be fine, okay?
I promise I am going to make sure that you're safe.
did you see where he put the key? - No.
Oh, I got it. I got it. I got it.
this is a little trick that I learned a long time ago.
all right.
that's far enough, Edwin!
here we go. We got it, we got it.
you're all right, sweetie.
okay. Sweetie, come here with me.
I got you, baby, I got you.
I'm sorry, okay?
I can change, I know I can.
none of us changes that much.
I think you're going to fall. - Then you gotta help me!
do I? Ah!
come on!
wake up, Mr. Stone, wake up.
wake up, Mr. Stone, wake up.
wake up, Mr. Stone, wake up.
wake up, Mr. Stone, wake up.
alarm off.
welcome to Solamyrge.
the time is now.
20 years ago, I built my first phone in my parents' basement.
now I give to you the Solamyrge SP, a phone to revolutionize the way we communicate.
a mere three ounces, voice-activated and solar-powered, the Solamyrge knows who you want to call before you do.
at Solamyrge, perfection isn't just an ideal...
it's a reality.
open blinds.
shower on.
we're here to take America back.
down with corporate greed!
down with corporate greed!
down with corporate greed!
down with corporate greed!
we're taking America back...!
down with corporate greed! Down with corporate greed!
down with corporate greed! Down with corporate greed!
if you're not mad, you're not paying attention!
down with corporate greed!
Hey! Stop it!
I can't believe it. This guy's bigger than Steve Jobs.
a lot of people are going to feel this loss.
at least one person won't. What about the girlfriend?
she's in shock. She is the one who called 911, though.
what are you thinking?
curious lack of stippling, indicating a long-range shot.
sniper? From where?
look at the direction he's facing.
no line of sight makes sense in this case.
bullet can't just materialize.
got to come from somewhere. You know what?
not necessarily.
ms. Yang?
you up for answering a few questions?
he's not coming back, is he?
look, I am so sorry.
I know how difficult this must be.
Matthew was bigger than life.
no matter how bad the cancer got, I knew he'd get better.
I just knew.
but I read online that he was dying.
no. He was gonna beat it.
were you home this morning? Is that how you found him?
no.
Matthew and I don't live together.
he didn't have time for a conventional relationship.
but we had breakfast together every morning.
and how does one meet a billionaire?
I used to be a coder at Solamyrge.
Amanda, do you know if Matthew had any rivals?
too many to count. Everybody envied him.
I mean, there was Matthew and...
there was the rest of the world.
Hey, Walter, check this out.
it's Stone's personal Solamyrge. I mean, this is like holding a piece of, uh, history.
it's just a phone, Wolfe. It's not just a phone. It's not just a phone.
would you call an Aston Martin just a car? People wait in line for days for these things.
Yeah, and the moment they break it out of the box, it's obsolete.
you're a hater. You're a hater. You know, for somebody so tech savvy,
stone led a pretty unplugged life. I don't even see a television, do y'all?
right? I thought I saw a TV on, but I don't know...
how'd you do that? I don't know.
wait, I got an idea. Ready? Football.
this thing is voice-activated! It's so cool.
Ooh. Oh, oh. He's going back, eh? Oh! Oh! Oh! Whoa, he's airing it out.
Oh, go, go, go! Television off.
Hey! - Why would you do that?
you're a meanie! - Guys, we're here to process a scene.
no, no, but I saw something on screen, for the case.
are you being serious? Yeah. Yeah, really.
television on.
they didn't throw a flag. - No.
no. The, uh... - You see that?
the little...
mute TV.
what is that?
little crescent-moon-shaped thing on the wall.
what is that, a bug? Someone was listening to Stone.
whoever put this thing on the wall did a sloppy job. They left a print.
animals.
you can't just deface private property in the name of free speech.
make sure you clean up all that graffiti.
Mr. Blackburn, answer the question, please.
why were you spying on your boss?
Matthew was a loose cannon.
between the chemo and the radiation, he'd lost his grip on reality. - In what way?
one minute he was totally lucid, the next he was spewing all sorts of lies to the press.
so bugging him is your attempt at damage control?
I was afraid he'd give away company secrets.
I had to know what he was saying at all times.
you know what I think, Mr. Blackburn? I think you were planning a coup.
you are the acting CEO.
Matthew out of the way, you get to take over the million-dollar salary, the stock options, the company jet, everything.
maybe you got a little impatient waiting for the cancer to kill him.
I was simply protecting the company he created.
and he would've done the same for me, if I were in his place.
Yeah, well, he can't do that now, can he? He's dead. It breaks my heart.
sounds like it. I have a business to run.
Mr. Benton. This thing is amazing.
Quadcore processor, AMOLED screen.
solar-powered battery... - Mr. Benton.
right, H. I'll just get going here.
so what do we got? Well, the data's encrypted.
looks like this guy Stone here has this thing locked down like Fort Knox.
can we crack it?
a buddy of mine just sent me the latest encryption-breaking software from Russia.
let me give it a shot.
it makes a logical image out of the data, allowing me to see the directory structure of the phone.
did he make or receive any calls today? No activity.
well, he did receive a series of text messages before he was killed.
the time is now. Three, two, one."" "The time is now. Three, two, one.
could be a countdown to his death.
who sent those texts? Girl named Heidi Taylor.
can we track her? I'll ping her phone number right now.
see if I can't pinpoint the last cell phone tower used.
Mr. Benton, they were sent in the last hour.
she could still be at the location.
wall Street subjugates the 99%.
we must instigate a revolution!
I didn't even know this movement was still going on.
Wow. Hey, man, you know where I can find this woman?
know where I can find this woman?
excuse me, man. You know where I can find this woman? Thanks.
I've got a thousand people ditching the snow and coming down from New York and D. C. and those numbers are growing.
we are going to shut this place down.
do you hear me?! Is that her?
you the A. C.L. U. reps?
Oh, yeah, we love protecting people's civil liberties.
M. D.P. D. We have a permit allowing us to demonstrate here.
Yeah, not why we're here. You sent several text messages to Matthew Stone this morning.
stone? I wouldn't send him anything.
he's the symbol of economic inequality.
on the front lines of the battle for financial reform, he represents everything that we're here fighting...
he's dead. He was killed this morning.
and we traced his last incoming texts to your phone. That-That's... impossible.
you just told us you hate him.
I hate what he stands for.
the man is worth ten billion dollars.
he designs phones to unite the masses, and then charges 500 bucks for them.
he is...
he was the epitome of corporate greed.
sounds like motive to me. I didn't kill Matthew Stone.
okay, until we're sure of that, let's grab your phone.
you're coming with us. - Come on, let's go.
wait. This is... this is ridiculous!
Hey, Wolfe? Hey.
did you hear Sam-O made detective? Yeah, yeah, I heard.
actually, I got her a little congratulations present.
like, what, a diamond ring? - Get out of here.
a diamond ring.
I got her a little bracelet with a little charm on it in the shape of Texas.
why Texas? Because she's from Texas, and she mentioned she misses home.
whoa, whoa, whoa. - What? What?
you wearing cologne?
Yeah, I'm wearing cologne. I want that crime scene stank to...
crime scene stank? Yeah.
Hey, heard your 15-88 came through. Congratulations, Detective.
Thanks.
so, uh, you sure you're ready? Oh, yeah.
when was the last time you were at the firing range? 5: 00 a. m.
5: 00 a. m. this morning? - Every morning.
okay.
hope you got a receipt for that.
Oh, no. Hey, Wolfe?
Yeah. - Wait up. You got a sec?
Yeah. - Hey, you're not gonna believe this.
Heidi Taylor-- she didn't send those texts.
her phone got hacked. - What?
trojan Horse virus extracted all her SIM information.
so she got framed for Stone's murder. Is the virus traceable?
unfortunately, no. It also wiped out the sender's IP address, but I could do some digging around, see if she has any enemies.
Yeah, you do that. I'll contact Stone's lawyer, see if I can't get a hold of his will.
you think this is about money? Stone's worth ten billion dollars.
a lot of people would kill for that.
Thanks, man.
stone's will's not in here. The lawyer said it would be.
Yeah, well, somebody beat us to it, then.
didn't know you and Samantha were so close. We're not, really.
is that right? I was actually thinking of, uh...
gotcha.
Hey, whoever took Stone's will might have left something behind.
what is it? A hair.
still in a lab coat? Just waiting for a callout.
so, I just released our protest girl, Heidi.
she's a trust fund kid. Hypocrite.
well, you're just in time, because Detective Owens is about to analyze some hair for us.
that's right. Congratulations, Detective.
doesn't really feel any different. It will.
Yeah, I know.
hair's fine.
the medulla pattern doesn't occupy more than half the shaft.
it's human hair. - Yeah.
it's unpigmented, so it's not head hair. So it must be body.
no, it's finer than that, and it has scales along the cuticle.
scales? I mean, thought it was human hair.
it is human.
it's lanugo hair. Of course. Lanugo hair.
lanugo hair is shed in the sixth month of gestation.
pretty safe to say that a fetus did not take Matthew Stone's will.
right, but lanugo hair is also found in anorexics.
true.
stone have a teenage daughter? No, but he has a very skinny girlfriend.
okay. Well, would you like to come with me to interview her?
Yeah, of course. Uh, no. I'll go.
because she knows me. I interviewed her this morning.
okay. Maybe next time.
next time.
I think we get it, Amanda.
you wanted to sneak a peek at the will to see what Matthew left you.
was it too much or too little? Either way, it's motive for murder.
my boyfriend is dead, and I get accusations?
you're being accused because we found your hair in the safe.
trying to be perfect for him-- the perfect weight, perfect looks.
and so what? He did not leave you anything, is that it?
you're both wrong.
Matthew asked me to take the will yesterday.
he said people were listening.
you feeling better today?
Amanda, they're all over me.
Blackburn-- he's got ears everywhere.
turned me into a prisoner in my own home.
blackburn wouldn't do that to you.
it's just the chemo, babe. It's making you paranoid.
I need you to get the will.
and keep it hidden, make sure no one can change it.
the cancer meds affected his mind.
I didn't think the threat was real, but I did whatever it took to keep him from worrying.
we're going to need to see that will. It's in a safe deposit box.
we're gonna need the key. We'll have to collect it and log it as evidence.
fine.
Hey, Tom.
I am astonished Mr. Stone lived so long with a grade four glioma.
he was truly a special man.
have you got a bullet for me yet, Tom?
not yet, but I'm just about to go fishing in his cranial tissue.
I don't know that I've ever retracted the dura mater of a genius.
the bullet fragmented through the frontal lobe, penetrated deep into the parietal.
got a piece.
that's not a piece of bullet, Tom.
you're right.
that looks like a microchip.
can you grab me another fragment?
is that some sort of rudder?
may I?
it's incredible.
this is from a smart bullet. I thought that it was purely conceptual.
the gun sends information about the target to the microchip, and then these fins act like little rudders that steer the bullet.
are you saying it changes direction in the air?
that's exactly what I'm saying.
it explains why our shooter didn't need a clear line of sight.
the only person that I can think of that would be smart enough and have access to the technology needed to make this bullet is Stone.
there may be one other person as smart, if not smarter.
who? I read an article about the company.
said Stone had a partner years ago.
they made the first Solamyrge in his parents' basement.
that sounds vaguely familiar.
I imagine this person is on their own private island by now.
no.
he walked away the day before they went public.
said money didn't matter to him.
maybe he changed his mind.
why would I kill Matt?
maybe you were tired of being the forgotten man.
he got billions, you got zilch.
easy for a techie like you to build a smart bullet and kill him.
smart bullet? I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't care about the money, and I still don't.
then why did you change his will? See that paragraph that mentions you?
the typeface doesn't match. - Somebody altered it recently.
and Stone's doorman said that you came by two days ago.
what happened? Matt asked me to come.
but changing the will was his idea, not mine.
Raj, don't leave. The company needs you.
we can do great things together.
Hey, you're confused, Matt. All that's in the past.
you deserve your money. I want you to have your share.
here, I want you to change it.
why don't you call your lawyers, and have them take care of it?
I don't trust them.
I need you to do it.
please.
he had an old typewriter in his closet.
asked me to use it so no one could trace the change.
wait a minute, so, he invited you over to give yourself 50 million bucks?
that's pretty generous.
look-- 121, 591 shares.
that's the date we met at computer camp.
they nicknamed us the Siamese Twins. We were inseparable.
this just proves that you know each other. Wrong.
he was my best friend. I could never have killed him.
it's happened before.
I'm so glad you're here.
I've been dying to show this to somebody.
well, I hope it's good, because Stone's former business partner denies making that smart bullet.
you got anything that can lead us to the manufacturer? I'm almost there.
is that it? Check it out.
you're not gonna believe this.
what is it? Stone was killed with his own bullet.
where did you find this? In Matthew Stone's head.
you want to explain why a cell phone company was manufacturing bullets?
three years ago, Matthew's kid brother, Tim, was killed by friendly fire in Iraq.
that's when he had us start designing the PW-ten rifle.
we're going to design a weapon that is so accurate that no American soldier will ever lose his life to friendly fire again.
Matthew, with all due respect, we make cell phones, not guns.
Tim's gone, Jerry. And we could have stopped that.
I could have stopped it. I don't want another family to go through that.
still not ready for market. Matthew wouldn't be satisfied until the gun was perfect.
well, one of those guns killed him. Seems like, to me, it works just fine.
we need to see those, now.
I'd love to show them to you, except both prototypes were stolen from the lab 48 hours ago.
did you call the police? We put our own security team on it.
Matthew was a very complicated guy.
he was very protective of this project.
he didn't want our competitors to know that we were developing weaponry.
if the guns were such a secret, how did anyone know to steal them?
we had a leak.
what kind of a leak?
Matthew was telling anyone who would listen about the guns.
by the time I caught wind, it was too late to stop him.
all right, stay down! Everybody stay down!
you, empty the till!
fill that up! Now!
Horatio, robbery in progress, a bank in Sweetwater.
911 caller said there were two gunmen with weird rifles.
okay. Hey, Detective Owens.
you ready for next time still? Yeah.
it's right now; let's go. Got a robbery in progress.
officer down, they need us for backup.
where are we headed?
we're headed for Miami National Bank.
all units, be advised.
two armed gunmen reported at scene, officer down.
proceed with extreme caution.
anybody see where the shots are coming from? Hey!
hold it right there!
Mike! Go! Hey, wait!
you!
you!
nice shot, Horatio.
problem is, it wasn't mine, Frank.
look at that wound.
this thing backfired.
you saying he shot himself? That's exactly what I'm saying.
look at that.
gang tat, A Street Assassin.
why would a street gang want to kill Matthew?
you're looking at the answer.
what the hell is this thing?
what was that, Eric?
that's what I was just gonna ask you. My tactics were textbook back there.
there was a standard diagonal deploy. - Who made the call?
I did. - That was your mistake!
wasn't your call to make; this is your first firefight. Just admit it; you don't trust me.
these weren't regular nine- millimeter bullets coming at us.
you think I don't know that? I think that you could've gotten yourself killed.
look at this thing.
laser range-finder, thermal infrared, electronic chambering.
I mean, these rifles are perfect. No wonder you can't miss.
it's not as perfect as you think; this one malfunctioned.
well, was it human error? - No.
it was a design flaw. Do you see this screen?
the way this weapon works is that the guidance system marks the target, and then it wirelessly sends the coordinates to the smart bullet.
right, which allows the bullet to guide itself to the target.
exactly.
except with this one, what happened was something was off with the guidance system, so the bullet turned sideways in the barrel.
okay, well which one of these rifles was used to kill Stone?
neither one. The ballistics came back negative on both.
blackburn said there were only two prototypes. So, if neither one of these is the murder weapon...
there's got to be a third one out there. Also means that Blackburn lied.
it is possible he doesn't know about the third one.
regardless, we're gonna be able to use these two guns to determine the location of Matthew's shooter.
according to my tests, the maximum range of the PW-ten weapon is a mile.
so, the shooter wasn't anywhere beyond that distance. Exactly.
and the bullet also would've needed another quarter of a mile to curve and then flatten out and hit Matthew the way it did.
and that would eliminate anything within a quarter of a mile.
so, see these red lines?
those are the paths the bullet would have traveled.
well, it's unlikely that it would have turned at a 90-degree angle, so that eliminates the marina and the street.
which basically leaves us two options.
the hotel to the east...
...and the apartment building to the west.
Yeah.
okay, well, I'll take the hotel. Do some knock and talks.
okay, great, I'll take the apartment building.
will you give me the address? Sure.
it is, uh...
it's 55 Olsen Street.
why does that sound familiar?
that's Raj Andari's address.
are you guys actually looking for cash from the will? You know, it doesn't really work like that.
Hey, genius, it's not about the money.
why don't you just save us the time, Raj, and tell us where the gun is?
I don't know what you're talking about.
no?
Eric, the balcony's clear.
he's clever.
he's apparently thought of everything.
know what? Maybe not everything.
there's something up here in this vent.
Hey, you can't just look in there. That's destruction of property. Just stay there.
Hey, just shut up.
I hope your warrant covers that.
Yeah.
this looks to me like this is the third prototype.
single round missing. This is the gun that killed Stone.
you pull the trigger?
he paid me to.
he said it wouldn't come back to me.
who paid you? Jerry Blackburn?
no, Matthew.
turn around. Turn around!
come on.
let's go.
so you're saying that your best friend had you shoot him in the head?
frankly, I thought you'd have a more authentic story than that, Raj.
it's the truth.
and all that talk about not wanting the money-- that was a lie.
it's funny how naive you can be at 20.
I thought money was evil.
I got older, I saw Matt's life, his mansion, his private jet-- I wanted that, too.
I wanted my money.
you think I'm still clomping around in Birkenstocks going to sweat lodges?
I want my share! You gave it up...
when you walked out on me and the business we started.
Yeah, that's right-- our business.
I deserve the billions just as much as you do.
TV on. ...another gorgeous sunny afternoon...
shower on.
stereo on!
what the hell are you doing? You think you can drown me out?
if you want the money so bad... then earn it.
earn it how?
kill me.
complicated way to commit suicide.
I thought it was the cancer talking.
then he showed me the prototype for the PW-ten.
he was serious. I designed it myself.
you want me to kill you with this?
you're out of your mind.
Matt planned everything.
so he had you hack into Heidi Taylor's phone...
to frame an innocent girl in your place?
Matt said she wouldn't be, said there was a reason to do it that way.
and he didn't share that reason with you.
no.
he said it was the only way to save Tim's life.
his dead brother? It didn't make any sense; I didn't argue.
his plan for me was clear.
and the inheritance was a payment for killing him.
he had me change the will the same day.
have a seat, please.
so if Stone's dying of cancer, why would he go to all the trouble to kill himself?
cause he's sending a message. - He could've done that online, he could've had a press conference... - He would've had no credibility.
that's why he selected Heidi Taylor.
and again, why Heidi Taylor? It could've been anyone.
he knew it was the last place Blackburn would have looked.
you have got to be kidding me.
so you're saying that someone's trying to pin the murder on me?
just like a power-crat, trying to blame the working class.
we actually think he was trying to draw attention to you for a different reason.
did he ever give you anything?
Oh, you mean when he came down here and we shared a hookah?
look, I have been e-mailing that douche for over a year now, and he only just sent me a "Dear Insert-name-here.
can we see that e-mail? - It wasn't electronic.
it was... it was snail mail-- one of those form letters.
do you still have it?
and thank you again for taking the time to share your concerns.
we look forward to hearing from you again.
sincerely-- Mathew Stone, CEO.
it certainly sounds like a form letter. Yeah.
you know, Calleigh, the logo on this is in ink, it's raised...
I think it's magnetic stripping.
I think you've been reading too many spy books.
I'm not kidding; take a look.
it's possible.
credit card companies use magnetic stripping to store personal information.
maybe Matthew embedded information on this for us to find.
okay, here we go. You were right.
2: 30, Overwatch Point, PW-ten, 10, 000 units
Calleigh, those are the details of a weapons sale.
overwatch Point is the headquarters of a private military contractor.
those guns weren't just prototypes.
Jerry Blackburn lied. He's been mass producing faulty weapons.
Ryan, this deal's going down now. We got to go.
let's go.
I see.
Yeah, let me call you back.
is there a problem?
want to get out of the car, please?
this transaction has been cancelled.
on what grounds? On the grounds you're selling defective weapons.
the ATF approved our designs... The ATF has revoked your license.
we let them know you falsified test results of the prototypes.
you have no proof of that.
Matthew Stone pointed us in the right direction.
Matthew... wanted the impossible.
the perfect gun-- there is no such thing.
I'm not gonna let you sell those weapons, Jerry.
they're not ready.
do you realize how leveraged we are on this thing?
I'm CEO now-- I say what's ready.
then I'll go to the press, and we'll see what the authorities say when they find out... - You're delusional.
the cancer treatment impaired your thinking.
who do you think's gonna listen to you?
nobody.
I couldn't let him bankrupt Solamyrge on his obsession.
I was just trying to protect the company.
take him, Frank. Turn around.
turn around, put your hands behind your back.
let's go.
Hey, so, uh, I heard you got into it with Sam today.
Yeah.
Yeah, not really sure how to clear the air on that one.
Yeah.
I think this'll do the trick.
you sure about this?
Yeah, you need it more than I do.
Hey, Wolfe, don't look at me like that.
what look? We've been down this road before, when Natalia first got here. Oh.
let's not do that again. - Yeah, let's not.
besides, man...
you don't think you really have a shot with Samantha, do you?
no, no.
so we're, uh, we're cool?
we're cool. Thanks, man.
you're welcome.
you rea... you don't... you don't think I have a shot?
well, maybe.
Hey. Come here, you got to see this.
Hey, man, look, if one more person tells me how this phone's gonna change my life... Will you just look?
I found this hidden on Stone's phone.
I bet you're wondering why it had to be like this.
it was my last resort.
the only way I could get people to believe me.
no one knew what I had put in motion.
but I knew the officers of the Miami-Dade Police Department could decipher my message.
I needed people with no agenda, people who could right a wrong, who would follow an investigation no matter where it went.
we make choices every day.
some we're conscious of, others we're not.
these choices...
they affect others, not just ourselves, and...
not always in good ways.
for that, I'm truly sorry.
but we all must follow our own path, no matter where it leads.
I hope I can be forgiven for my mistakes.
I'm not perfect.
but then again, none of us are.
these choices...
they're up to all of you now, and I pray you make them with the same ethic I've tried to live by.
in the end... that's all that matters, is that you tried to leave this place a little better than when you got here.
the time is now.
bitch!
someone... Someone...
help.
do you want to order another drink?
what?
did you want to order another...
Hey, are you okay?
maybe you should get some air. Maybe you should get some air.
help! Somebody!
what happened?! - Oh, my God! I think she's dead.
call 911! Help!
all right, follow the pen and keep your head still.
no one was in the street when I turned the corner.
I was looking for parking. I swear.
if no one was on the street, how'd she end up under your car?
I told you, I didn't see her.
all right. Open your mouth and blow on that.
I thought I hit a dog. I-I got out to check and, and saw her...
hang tight.
well, our driver was sober. He said he didn't see the vic in the alleyway.
we got a cause of death?
her cervical vertebrae and lateral malleoli are crushed.
so she's got a broken neck. - Not exactly.
these injuries suggest she was already on the ground when run over.
and look... frothing.
and... Ocular miosis.
which tells you what?
these are all symptoms of being poisoned by a nerve agent.
odds are she was already dead when the car hit her.
so what you're saying is, the car was unrelated to her death.
she's cyanotic. I'd say she was poisoned minutes ago at most.
maybe the killer's still inside, Horatio.
Frank, lock it down. Nobody leaves.
everybody settle down! Please settle down!
now we can't release you until you've all been questioned individually.
Yes, exactly. So the sooner you shut up, the sooner you go home.
thank you.
why don't you just save us the time and tell us what you put in her drink.
her drink was empty.
I asked if she wanted a refill. That's my job.
this test will tell us whether or not you're telling the truth.
come on, she was drooling on herself when she came to the bar.
Hey, guy slips drugs in a girl's drink and then gets his way with her.
you think it's the first time we've heard a story like that?
do you mind? - No, it's fine.
Hi. This is CSI Duquesne.
Yes, of course. How are you?
Absolutely. A meeting today still works.
2: 00 p. m.is perfect.
okay.
I know that you have my fingerprints on file, but if you should need a blood sample, I'm happy to provide it.
wonderful. Okay. Thank you again.
sorry.
so?
swabs are all negative.
doesn't appear to be any trace of nerve agent in any of these glasses.
you said that the victim was sick when she got to the bar.
Yeah. Hunched over. Coughing.
you see where she was before she came to the bar?
Yeah, I think I saw her step out of the bathroom.
okay. Great. Thank you.
I'll meet you in the bathroom. - All right.
so far, I've got nothing here.
Yeah, I got nothing at the sink either.
Hey. There's a purse in the trash.
I just I. D.'d our victim--Denise Baines.
she's got a Carol City address. 25 years old.
all right, well, let's, uh, let's test the stuff in her purse, see if anything pops positive for poison.
okay.
have you got enough in your kit for me?
have I ever not?
so, um...
you thinking of becoming a private detective or something?
a private detective?!
well, I heard you on the phone earlier.
you eavesdropping? - No. I was not eavesdropping.
you were three feet away, I could hear everything.
okay, well that's fair.
well, the answer is not in a million years. But you know that.
bingo. This thing just popped positive for yellow.
that means there's a G series nerve agent present in that.
if she put a drop of that in her eye it would shut down her body almost immediately.
the three G series nerve agents are Tabun, Soman, and Sarin.
did it have a color?
no, no, it didn't have any color at all. It was a clear liquid.
which narrows it to Tabun and Sarin. Did it have a fruity odor?
no. No smell at all. No odor.
then that confirms Denise was poisoned with liquid Sarin.
a few drops of it can kill someone within minutes.
Hey, Doc, how easily could others have been exposed?
if the liquid evaporated into a vapor, anyone standing within several feet of it could get sick.
you know, I interviewed that valet, he said he put a woman in a cab who was half dead.
if she was exposed, she'll die without an immediate dose of Atropine.
all right, we've got to find her right away. She's our only link to the killer.
you remember what the woman looked like?
she was tall, like, six feet; brown hair.
you said she looked sick. How sick?
eyes were watering, coughing real bad, and uh... and she was real sweaty.
and then she puked right there on the curb.
you've gotta go to the back. You've gotta go to the back.
Oh, come on. - That's nasty.
just put me in a cab. - You got it, lady.
she slipped me $100 bill to let her cut.
damn. All symptoms of Sarin poisoning.
Yeah. We're gonna need that bill that she gave you.
Yeah, the bill. Give it up, fool.
that's evidence in a murder investigation.
Yeah, it's yellow. That means she was in direct contact with the poison.
great. Our only lead is dying, we don't know where she is.
hold up. Poison? I touched that bill.
am I gonna get sick?
no, you'll be all right. You'd be showing symptoms already.
what was the cab company that you called?
Sunstar Taxi. - Sunstar Taxi.
Yeah. This is CSI Walter Simmons MDPD.
I need to track a recent pick up.
Yeah, 25 Azure Avenue.
single female passenger.
no, about 30 minutes ago.
Yeah. You do? Okay. All right. Thank you.
you got a drop-off location?
sure you got the right address?
I don't know. That's what the cab company said
why would a sick girl want to be dropped off here?
good question.
if you see anything call me, got it? - Got it.
please... help me.
please...
help me.
ma'am.
it's all right, ma'am. Miami Dade Police.
were you at a club downtown today?
Yes. Please, my throat.
I can barely breathe.
it's okay.
I'll, uh... I'll get you to a hospital.
don't even think about it!
thanks for that.
Oh, so she took apart your gun, Frank? While it was in your hand?
don't start with me, Owens.
that woman had some sort of special training or something.
don't be too embarrassed.
that gun's easy to dismantle.
just pulled passports from your bag. Which one of these is your real name?
take your pick.
you're a professional... paid to kill Denise Baines, and this place is your money drop.
and you're trying to get rid of that file 'cause it's the only thing that links you to the murder.
you're not the smoothest killer. You poisoned yourself.
just a few drops, not enough to do any real damage.
she turned around faster than I expected.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I'm sorry. - No problem.
who paid you to kill her?
like you said, I'm a professional.
discretion is also a virtue.
well, you're about to go away for life unless you tell us something right now.
then I'll take life.
get her the hell out of here.
something's weird.
and why hire a professional to take out some random party girl?
only one good reason for that.
our victim's not random.
let's go.
this is Denise Baines' apartment. You got the keys?
Yeah.
Denise lived at her desk.
Yeah.
a lot of books.
I guess she wasn't the party girl we thought she was.
no.
chinese.
so she never left her desk.
let's see what this is all about.
looks like she was writing a draft of an article for the Miami Beacon.
maybe that's what she was onto then. She's onto something big, and that's why she got targeted.
big story in the Miami Beacon? I don't think so.
well, there's gotta be some sort of needle in this file stack.
Yeah, well, let's, uh, let's hope so.
Yeah, I'm not finding anything significant over here.
Miami Beacon.
look at this... more Chinese food.
what was this girl, like a hundred pounds maybe? How much could one little girl eat?
she had a pretty healthy appetite.
unless she had a guest.
see... Now you're onto something.
got a dress.
in a size two, so that's probably right around the size that she wears.
so this is hers, but, uh...
I'll bet that contribution isn't.
want to bag that up? - Sure.
you know, and I'll take the keys back to the landlord, and I'll meet you at the lab.
Yeah. See you there in a few minutes.
what did you say, bitch?
I said,"Touch me again with those grimy hands and you'll regret it
you're such an ass!
and you're a bimbo! Giving out your number like that?
we ordered pizza, moron. I had to give that guy my number.
what did I tell you? What did I tell you?
MDPD! Break it up!
Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry. Are you okay?
that's assault. You gonna arrest her?
no one's getting arrested, all right? Just relax.
you people live in this building?
we live right there.
you know Denise Baines, that lives around the corner?
Yeah. Heard she died.
you see anybody coming to visit her last night?
um, well, like, a different guy every night.
she's what you call, like, promiscuous.
that's the understatement of the century.
if you saw photos of any of these people, would you'd be able to I. D. them?
depends. I only saw a couple from behind.
but they were tall, dark and hot.
are you sure you don't want to press charges on assault or...
no one's pressing charges. I told you that.
I'll give you my card.
you see any one of these people, you make sure you give me a call. Understand?
go to your apartment, get inside.
you... you go cool off somewhere.
you know what you're doing?
mm, I've done this before.
you're gonna miss your 2: 00 appointment.
no. I'll make it.
fingerprints, blood tests...
you, uh, joining the Feds, or you getting married?
Oh, gosh.
if I need fingerprints to get married, I'm in trouble.
Nah, it's nothing like that.
well, what is it?
I'm thinking about adopting Austin North and his sister.
that's... that's great.
well, if you need any help doing that, I-I'd love to help.
I don't know. I think this is something I have to do on my own.
it's hard parenting alone, you know.
I think what these kids need is stability and...
you know, you and I, we're on, we're off, we're on.
it's anything but stable. - Yeah.
putting the kids first.
you're already thinking like a mom.
I guess I am.
all right.
that'll heal.
you're still handsome.
and I have to go.
Horatio, it's Nat.
I just ran the sample on Denise Baines' dress...
and I-I don't know how to handle this one.
the DNA contribution belonged to Randall Stafford.
Exact--that Randall Stafford.
the head of Miami's City Council.
as councilman, I promise the city that this drone will be the first unmanned aircraft in civilian airspace in Miami's history.
any questions?
were you involved in the murder of Denise Baines?
uh, it looks like my time here is up.
one of the top advisors from the FAA will now answer any further questions.
thank you.
how dare you hijack my press conference. - You didn't answer my question, councilman.
Denise's murder is obviously under tragic circumstances.
you had a relationship with the lady, didn't you?
no. That's decidedly untrue.
well, then you better explain the DNA we found on her dress, councilman.
I think you might want to do that.
this is neither the time or the place. - You either answer my question, or I'm gonna cuff you in front of that pretty wife of yours.
okay, look, Denise was writing a profile on me for the Miami Beacon.
she was shadowing me.
over time, we got close.
be honest in your portrayal.
don't hold back.
nothing is off-limits.
heard that before.
I said that before.
this time...
this time I mean it.
it was a mistake, Horatio. She was a mistake.
I want my attorney present before you... - I think we can facilitate that.
why don't you make a call. I'll be inside.
Horatio. Well, you look a little different since I last saw you.
been working on your tan?
I thought I told you to stay out of Miami.
Oh, I know.
I'd love to accommodate you, but the truth is, my firm's new Miami branch is thriving, and so my priority clients...
uh, hi, councilman...
they demand my priority time.
Oh, I'm sure.
our evidence links your priority client to a murder.
Ah, yes, of course. The infamous stained dress, yeah.
by the way...sorry...but who is this guy?
his name is CSI Eric Delko.
CSI Eric Delko.
one of Miami's finest foot soldiers, no doubt.
Gabby, where are we at here?
so, after collecting this stained dress from Denise Baines' apartment,
CSI Delko, where did you put it?
I followed protocol... I put it in a sealed evidence box.
wasn't there an altercation in her hallway during the time you were there?
and how would you know that?
due diligence, Horatio. We're viciously thorough.
Yeah, there was... a domestic dispute.
and where did you put the evidence when you intervened in this dispute?
I put the evidence down on the floor in front of Denise's apartment.
the floor.
but I thought the dispute took place down the hall and round the corner.
Yeah, it did. So what?
so that would put the evidence out of your line of sight.
look, I might have lost sight of the evidence for... a minute, maybe.
one minute? 60 long ticks of the clock, sir.
and the point is?
my point is that CSI Eric Delko left evidence unattended,
and, you know, judges, they love unattended evidence.
they also love putting people in jail.
so we're done here?
Yes, councilman, we are. We're leaving.
don't get comfortable.
you know I love Miami.
Hey, can you recommend any good restaurants? - You heard what I said.
Oh, come on, you're such a grouch. Cheer up.
all right, have a nice day.
you... I don't care.
we need to talk.
there's no way that evidence was tampered with, H.
I agree, Eric.
well, how did they know about the dispute? The line of sight?
cause they've been following us.
well, that's because they know that the councilman's guilty, they want to keep him out of jail.
they wouldn't have gone to this length if he was innocent, would they have?
Denise must know something much bigger about the councilman.
let's find out.
look at this.
all Denise's notes are written in shorthand.
it's all one sound, one syllable.
who uses shorthand?
well, a journalist trying to conceal sensitive research.
cause it's all code.
this is the symbol that occurs the most. It stands for "S."
they're all followed by phrases like "approved shutdown,
signed legislation" and "office will not comment.
the S" means staffer. - Yeah, it's got to.
so you're absolutely right - this didn't have anything to do with sex.
this was all about Denise trying to get info on Stafford.
what's that one?
power to the local union building out 90 minutes Thursday night
hang on a second, I just read an article...
something here... Here it is.
Denise, she wrote an article about power outages that cancelled an important union meeting.
she also wrote another draft on a city firehouse that was for sale and a street repaving.
those are all city services that are influenced by the councilman.
what was that-- wait a minute, let me see that one about the street repaving.
that's kind of convenient.
the street repaving was behind Delonte Cassell's nightclub.
delonte Cassell...that's... Remember?
that's the club owner that was suspected of killing one of his own customers?
Yeah.
was a couple of weeks ago, right?
Yeah. What's that about? - Hang on a second.
the vic was Jimmy Ruiz.
says here he was found in a Dumpster a couple of blocks from the club.
Cassell and Ruiz got into a fight before Ruiz left the club, and that was the last time he was seen alive.
can you find out what happened with the case, what the verdict was?
Yeah.
looks like he got off; lack of evidence.
well, let's see if Denise has anything to say about it in her notes.
yes,"Councilman Stafford ordered the street behind the club repaved the morning after Ruiz was shot.
why would the councilman have to act so fast?
I mean, what was his rush?
I'll betcha I know where I can dig up an answer.
look at that. It's a spent shell casing.
if I had to guess, it's from a nine-millimeter.
and that's what Ruiz was shot with.
let's see what else we can get.
blood... and a whole lot of it.
we just found where Ruiz was shot.
put your business back in your pants and get the hell out of here.
and if you ever touch one of my girls like that again...
Hey, so we ended up pulling five nine-millimeter shell casings from the pavement behind the club.
that's not enough to charge Cassell in the reshooting.
you know? I need something that puts him at the scene.
Yeah, I'm still looking.
so, are you coming over tonight?
Yeah, of course.
you're the ASA on this?
that's right. That okay with you? - Yeah, it's fine.
but I think you should know that we think Councilman Stafford helped Cassell cover up this murder.
why would one of Miami's highest-ranking public officials help one of its dirtiest scumbags?
Cassell's a thug.
that's a good question - I think we need to ask Cassell that.
what makes you think he'll talk?
maybe a nail in his coffin. I got a print.
you know what this is, Delonte?
it's a shell casing with your fingerprints on it.
and you know what it proves?
it proves that you killed Jimmy Ruiz two weeks ago.
so you say. Is my lawyer here yet?
Yeah, your lawyer can come here.
but I'll tell you what, we got ASA Avery over here, and he's ready to make you a pretty sweet deal.
Really? What kind of deal we talking about?
well, that depends - tell us about your relationship with Councilman Stafford.
councilman?
do I look like the type who hangs with a councilman, suit?
no, you don't, but, uh, we got a work order request for the city here to repave the street that you shot Ruiz on, and, uh... it's signed by Councilman Stafford.
two hours after Ruiz died. That's not a coincidence.
I can make your life a whole lot easier if you just talk to us, Delonte.
shut your mouth, Delonte.
your words are attracting a lot of flies.
what the hell are you doing here?
we represent Mr. Cassell.
well, we're allowed to have more than one client. I mean, it helps with the very pricey overhead.
uh, now, could I see the evidence against Mr. Cassell?
Thanks, sir.
well, this just looks like a bunch of, uh, nine-millimeter shell casings. So?
they have Cassell's prints on them.
better put the glasses on, then, huh?
uh, Ruiz, he was killed with a nine-millimeter, correct?
Yeah, you and your client would know about that.
wait... wait a minute, there's a . 45 casing here on your lab table.
is that a . 45 ca... What do you think?
well, look at that.
that's a . 45 right there.
I mean, did you recover a . 45 shell casing from behind Mr. Cassell's club?
no, we didn't.
Really? That wasn't there before.
Oh, yes, it was there. I mean, uh, that is your photo, sweetheart, yes?
well, now, if...you didn't find a . 45 casing in the alley, where did it come from?
unless it came from another case.
that's impossible.
I don't think so. That's called cross-contamination.
thus, the casings and the prints would be deemed inadmissible.
how the hell did this happen, Sam?
you see? Even ASA Avery, despite his lack of experience and cheap suits,: he knows your case just flatlined.
so, I've been scanning through our database, looking at all of Vogel's other clients that we've arrested.
anything jump out?
you tell me - am I crazy, or do you see a pattern here?
Yeah!
Vogel's clients are all felons, got hit with light slaps on the wrist when they should've gotten serious time.
thank you.
hung juries, acquittals, insufficient evidence - all thanks to Vogel.
wait, hang on. Go back.
that guy.
that's the guy from the hallway at Denise's apartment today.
that's the one that was having the fight with the woman that smacked me in the face.
the domestic you broke up this morning? - Yeah.
Yeah, this guy, Clyde Novak, huh?
booked last year on assault and battery. Charges were dropped.
so, Clyde owed Vogel big-time.
charges were dropped.
this guy staged the fight with the woman, so that I'd break our chain of custody.
okay, okay, he's coming. So, do-do you want me to draw blood?
just make it sound real. What'd you say, bitch?!
I said touch me again with those grimy hands, and you'll regret it.
louder. Louder. Come on, louder.
Vogel's blackmailing his clients to do his dirty work.
Vogel was blackmailing his clients, wasn't he, councilman?
and Denise found out about it, didn't she?
she came to me about it. So, I confronted Vogel.
and that's how he found out about Denise, because you outed her, didn't you?
I never wanted her to get hurt. - But she did get hurt.
she got killed right over there.
because of you, he killed her before she could publish what she uncovered about him:
how he used his clients to get other clients out of trouble.
what do you want from me, Horatio? - I need your testimony, councilman.
I can't testify against Vogel.
look what he does to people who cross him. I-I have a family.
you don't have a choice.
you do have a family, and they're gonna be next.
you need to think about that.
you need to think about it.
Yes, Natalia? - You won't believe who just showed up.
I'm on my way.
Ah, Horatio, thank goodness you're here.
I've been trying to get ahold of you for hours.
actually, I'm fresh off a conversation with Councilman Stafford.
well, that must have been a bit one-sided.
not a great conversationalist, is he?
well, come to think of it, neither are you.
till now.
all right, come on, what is it?
what is it? The suspense is killing me here.
for starters, we know you had two of your clients go over and stage a fight at Denise Baines' house today so you could compromise evidence.
it seems, Mr. Vogel, that she found out the truth about you and lost her life for it.
Really? Well, do tell me, what is this truth exactly?
blackmail.
because we know you're blackmailing your clients like Councilman Stafford.
my dear, those are some wild, wild allegations.
Really?
listen, I can't speak to the blackmail part of this, but I can speak to the other allegations.
that won't be necessary at this time.
well, excuse me, I beg to differ there, Horatio.
miss Wade has something that she wants to tell you.
I hired Clyde Novak and another client to stage the fight at Denise Baines'.
I also hired that contract killer to poison her.
I acted alone.
I perceived a threat to my clients and acted independently.
feels better now, doesn't it, just to get that off your chest, Gabby.
now, listen, I'm gonna make sure you get the best representation.
hell, I may even do it myself.
thank you, Horatio.
without you, Miss Wade here would continue to be a blight on my firm.
miss Wade?
have you ever actually been to prison?
no.
well, then, I commend you on your blind sense of loyalty.
you know you don't have to be the scapegoat, right?
this is your only opportunity to tell us what he has on you.
miss Wade?
I'd like to give my official statement now.
without the councilman's testimony, we have nothing.
this whole thing falls on Gabrielle Wade.
Yeah, Vogel played us real good.
he was a step ahead of us the whole time.
what's going on? - because we discovered that...
son of a bitch.
the Miami-Dade Crime Lab mishandled evidence in a recent case.
what? Are you kidding me?
the CSI Samantha Owens used improper procedures, which puts into question not only her work on this particular case, but every single case that she's worked on including our client's, Esteban Navarro's.
now, I can't say any more at this stage.
I will be making a statement later, but thank you so much.
it's a beautiful day; enjoy it. I am going for lunch.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
I'm guessing you heard?
Esteban Navarro's getting out, and all the cases that I processed evidence on are falling apart.
God, I guess I really screwed this up.
no, I don't think you did, Sam.
well, what are you talking about?
sorry to keep you waiting.
I've had another busy, busy, busy day.
well, of course, you'd know that, wouldn't you?
somebody compromised the evidence when they planted this casing;
someone close to us who is working for Vogel.
Ryan, you don't think that I would even...
Sam, let me ask you something.
where did you meet your boyfriend?
Josh? At the gym, why?
did he approach you?
Yeah, he did. Wh-what's the point?
Sam, he had access.
he was there.
you've been very loyal, my boy. Very loyal.
what do you want me to do now, Darren?
Wha... You think that he planted the casing?
he's the assistant state attorney. He would never...
he had access to our trace lab.
well, I think the first order of business is to make sure that
lieutenant Caine and his CSIs never bother this law firm or any of its clients ever again.
if this is true, then I'm done.
I'm finished.
not if I have anything to say about it.
bitch!
someone...
someone
help.
someone
do you want to order another drink?
what? Did you want to order another...
Hey, are you okay?
maybe you should get some air.
maybe you should get some air.
help! Somebody!
what happened?! - Oh, my God!
I think she's dead. Call 911! Help!
all right, follow the pen and keep your head still.
no one was in the street when I turned the corner.
I was looking for parking. I swear.
if no one was on the street, how'd she end up under your car?
I told you, I didn't see her.
all right. Open your mouth and blow on that.
I thought I hit a dog.
I- I got out to check and, and saw her...
hang tight.
well, our driver was sober.
he said he didn't see the vic in the alleyway.
we got a cause of death?
her cervical vertebrae and lateral malleoli are crushed.
so she's got a broken neck.
not exactly. These injuries suggest she was already on the ground when run over.
and look... frothing.
and... Ocular miosis.
which tells you what?
these are all symptoms of being poisoned by a nerve agent.
odds are she was already dead when the car hit her.
so what you're saying is, the car was unrelated to her death.
she's cyanotic. I'd say she was poisoned minutes ago at most.
maybe the killer's still inside, Horatio.
Frank, lock it down. Nobody leaves.
everybody settle down! Please settle down!
now we can't release you until you've all been questioned individually.
Yes, exactly.
so the sooner you shut up, the sooner you go home.
thank you.
why don't you just save us the time and tell us what you put in her drink.
her drink was empty. I asked if she wanted a refill.
that's my job. This test will tell us whether or not you're telling the truth.
come on, she was drooling on herself when she came to the bar.
Hey, guy slips drugs in a girl's drink and then gets his way with her.
you think it's the first time we've heard a story like that?
do you mind? No, it's fine. I got this.
Hi. This is CSI Duquesne.
Yes, of course. How are you?
Absolutely. A meeting today still works.
2: 00 p. m. is perfect.
okay. I know that you have my fingerprints on file, but if you should need a blood sample, I'm happy to provide it.
wonderful. Okay. Thank you again.
sorry.
so? Swabs are all negative.
doesn't appear to be any trace of nerve agent in any of these glasses.
you said that the victim was sick when she got to the bar.
Yeah. Hunched over. Coughing. You see where she was before she came to the bar?
Yeah, I think I saw her step out of the bathroom.
okay. Great. Thank you.
I'll meet you in the bathroom. - All right.
so far, I've got nothing here.
Yeah, I got nothing at the sink either.
Hey. There's a purse in the trash.
I just I. D.'d our victim- Denise Baines.
she's got a Carol City address. 25 years old.
all right, well, let's, uh, let's test the stuff in her purse, see if anything pops positive for poison.
okay. Have you got enough in your kit for me?
have I ever not?
so, um...
you thinking of becoming a private detective or something?
a private detective?!
well, I heard you on the phone earlier.
you eavesdropping? - No.
I was not eavesdropping. You were three feet away, I could hear everything.
okay, well that's fair. Well, the answer is not in a million years.
but you know that.
bingo.
this thing just popped positive for yellow.
that means there's a G series nerve agent present in that.
if she put a drop of that in her eye it would shut down her body almost immediately.
the three G series nerve agents are Tabun, Soman, and Sarin.
did it have a color? No, no, it didn't have any color at all.
it was a clear liquid. Which narrows it to Tabun and Sarin.
did it have a fruity odor? No. No smell at all. No odor.
then that confirms Denise was poisoned with liquid Sarin.
a few drops of it can kill someone within minutes.
Hey, Doc, how easily could others have been exposed? If the liquid evaporated into a vapor, anyone standing within several feet of it could get sick.
you know, I interviewed that valet, he said he put a woman in a cab who was half dead.
if she was exposed, she'll die without an immediate dose of Atropine.
all right, we've got to find her right away. She's our only link to the killer.
you remember what the woman looked like?
she was tall, like, six feet; brown hair.
you said she looked sick. How sick? Eyes were watering, coughing real bad, and uh... and she was real sweaty.
and then she puked right there on the curb.
you've gotta go to the back. You've gotta go to the back.
EW. - Oh, come on.
you got it, lady.
she slipped me $100 bill to let her cut.
damn. All symptoms of Sarin poisoning.
Yeah. We're gonna need that bill that she gave you.
Yeah, the bill. Give it up, fool.
that's evidence in a murder investigation.
Yeah, it's yellow.
that means she was in direct contact with the poison.
great. Our only lead is dying, we don't know where she is.
hold up. Poison? I touched that bill.
am I gonna get sick?
no, you'll be all right.
you'd be showing symptoms already.
what was the cab company that you called?
Yeah. This is CSI Walter Simmons MDPD.
I need to track a recent pick up.
Yeah, 25 Azure Avenue.
Uh-huh. Single female passenger.
no, about 30 minutes ago.
Yeah.
you do? Okay. All right. Thank you.
you got a drop-off location? Yeah.
sure you got the right address?
I don't know. That's what the cab company said
why would a sick girl want to be dropped off here?
good question.
if you see anything call me, got it?
got it.
please... help me.
please...
help me. Ma'am.
it's all right, ma'am. Miami Dade Police.
were you at a club downtown today?
Yes. Please, my throat.
I can barely breathe. It's okay.
I'll, uh... I'll get you to a hospital.
don't even think about it!
thanks for that.
Oh, so she took apart your gun, Frank?
while it was in your hand? Don't start with me, Owens.
that woman had some sort of special training or something.
don't be too embarrassed.
that gun's easy to dismantle. Just pulled passports from your bag.
which one of these is your real name? Take your pick.
you're a professional... paid to kill Denise Baines, and this place is your money drop.
and you're trying to get rid of that file 'cause it's the only thing that links you to the murder.
you're not the smoothest killer. You poisoned yourself.
just a few drops, not enough to do any real damage.
she turned around faster than I expected.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh. I'm sorry. No problem.
who paid you to kill her?
like you said, I'm a professional.
discretion is also a virtue.
well, you're about to go away for life unless you tell us something right now.
then I'll take life.
get her the hell out of here.
something's weird.
and why hire a professional to take out some random party girl?
only one good reason for that. Our victim's not random.
let's go.
this is Denise Baines' apartment.
you got the keys? - Yeah.
Denise lived at her desk.
Yeah.
a lot of books.
I guess she wasn't the party girl we thought she was. No.
chinese. So she never left her desk.
let's see what this is all about.
looks like she was writing a draft of an article for the Miami Beacon.
maybe that's what she was onto then. She's onto something big, and that's why she got targeted.
big story in the Miami Beacon?
I don't think so.
well, there's gotta be some sort of needle in this file stack.
Yeah, well, let's, uh, let's hope so.
Yeah, I'm not finding anything significant over here.
Miami Beacon.
look at this... more Chinese food.
what was this girl, like a hundred pounds maybe? How much could one little girl eat?
she had a pretty healthy appetite.
unless she had a guest.
see... Now you're onto something.
got a dress.
in a size two, so that's probably right around the size that she wears.
so this is hers, but, uh...
I'll bet that contribution isn't.
want to bag that up? - Sure.
you know, and I'll take the keys back to the landlord, and I'll meet you at the lab. Yeah.
see you there in a few minutes.
what did you say, bitch?
I said, "Touch me again with those grimy hands and you'll regret it
you're such an ass! - And you're a bimbo!
giving out your number like that? - We ordered pizza, moron.
I had to give that guy my number. - What did I tell you?
what did I tell you? - MDPD! Break it up!
Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.
are you okay? - That's assault. You gonna arrest her?
no one's getting arrested, all right? Just relax.
you people live in this building? We live right there.
you know Denise Baines, that lives around the corner?
Yeah. Heard she died.
you see anybody coming to visit her last night? Um, well, like, a different guy every night.
she's what you call, like, promiscuous.
that's the understatement of the century.
if you saw photos of any of these people, would you'd be able to I. D. them?
depends. I only saw a couple from behind.
but they were tall, dark and hot.
are you sure you don't want to press charges on assault or...
no one's pressing charges. I told you that.
I'll give you my card.
you see any one of these people, you make sure you give me a call. Understand?
go to your apartment, get inside. You... you go cool off somewhere.
you know what you're doing?
mm, I've done this before.
you're gonna miss your 2: 00 appointment. No. I'll make it.
fingerprints, blood tests...
you, uh, joining the Feds, or you getting married?
Oh, gosh.
if I need fingerprints to get married, I'm in trouble.
Nah, it's nothing like that.
well, what is it?
I'm thinking about adopting Austin North and his sister.
well, if you need any help doing that, I-I'd love to help.
I don't know.
I think this is something I have to do on my own.
it's hard parenting alone, you know.
I think what these kids need is stability and...
you know, you and I, we're on, we're off, we're on.
it's anything but stable. - Yeah.
putting the kids first.
you're already thinking like a mom.
I guess I am.
all right.
that'll heal.
you're still handsome.
and I have to go.
Horatio, it's Nat.
I just ran the sample on Denise Baines' dress...
and I-I don't know how to handle this one.
the DNA contribution belonged to Randall Stafford.
Exact- that Randall Stafford.
the head of Miami's City Council.
as councilman, I promise the city that this drone will be the first unmanned aircraft in civilian airspace in Miami's history.
any questions?
were you involved in the murder of Denise Baines?
uh, it looks like my time here is up.
one of the top advisors from the FAA will now answer any further questions.
thank you.
how dare you hijack my press conference. You didn't answer my question, councilman.
Denise's murder is obviously under tragic circumstances.
you had a relationship with the lady, didn't you?
no. That's decidedly untrue.
well, then you better explain the DNA we found on her dress, councilman.
I think you might want to do that.
this is neither the time or the place.
you either answer my question, or I'm gonna cuff you in front of that pretty wife of yours.
okay, look, Denise was writing a profile on me for the Miami Beacon.
she was shadowing me. Over time, we got close.
be honest in your portrayal.
don't hold back.
nothing is off-limits.
heard that before.
I said that before.
this time...
...this time I mean it.
it was a mistake, Horatio. She was a mistake.
I want my attorney present before you... I think we can facilitate that.
why don't you make a call.
I'll be inside.
Horatio. Well, you look a little different since I last saw you.
been working on your tan? I thought I told you to stay out of Miami.
Oh, I know.
I'd love to accommodate you, but the truth is, my firm's new Miami branch is thriving, and so my priority clients
uh, hi, councilman- they demand my priority time.
Oh, I'm sure.
our evidence links your priority client to a murder.
Ah, yes, of course.
the infamous stained dress, yeah.
by the way- sorry- but who is this guy?
his name is CSI Eric Delko. - Ah.
CSI Eric Delko. Oh.
one of Miami's finest foot soldiers, no doubt.
Gabby, where are we at here?
so, after collecting this stained dress from Denise Baines' apartment,
CSI Delko, where did you put it?
I followed protocol- I put it in a sealed evidence box.
wasn't there an altercation in her hallway during the time you were there?
and how would you know that? Due diligence, Horatio.
we're viciously thorough.
Yeah, there was- a domestic dispute.
Mm-hmm. And where did you put the evidence when you intervened in this dispute?
I put the evidence down on the floor in front of Denise's apartment.
the floor. Hm.
but I thought the dispute took place down the hall and round the corner.
Yeah, it did. So what?
so that would put the evidence out of your line of sight.
look, I might have lost sight of the evidence for... a minute, maybe.
one minute? 60 long ticks of the clock, sir.
and the point is?
my point is that CSI Eric Delko left evidence unattended, and, you know, judges, they love unattended evidence.
they also love putting people in jail.
so we're done here? Yes, councilman, we are. We're leaving.
don't get comfortable. You know I love Miami.
Hey, can you recommend any good restaurants? You heard what I said.
Oh, come on, you're such a grouch. Cheer up.
all right, have a nice day.
you... I don't care.
we need to talk.
there's no way that evidence was tampered with, H. I agree, Eric.
well, how did they know about the dispute? The line of sight? 'Cause they've been following us.
well, that's because they know that the councilman's guilty, they want to keep him out of jail.
they wouldn't have gone to this length if he was innocent, would they have?
Denise must know something much bigger about the councilman. Let's find out.
look at this.
all Denise's notes are written in shorthand.
it's all one sound, one syllable.
who uses shorthand?
well, a journalist trying to conceal sensitive research.
cause it's all code.
this is the symbol that occurs the most. It stands for "S."
they're all followed by phrases like "approved shutdown,
signed legislation
and "office will not comment.
the "S" means staffer.
Yeah, it's got to. So you're absolutely right- this didn't have anything to do with sex.
this was all about Denise trying to get info on Stafford.
what's that one?
power to the local union building out 90 minutes Thursday night
hang on a second, I just read an article...
something here...
here it is. Denise, she wrote an article about power outages that cancelled an important union meeting.
on a city firehouse that was for sale and a street repaving.
those are all city services that are influenced by the councilman.
what was that- wait a minute, let me see that one about the street repaving.
that's kind of convenient.
the street repaving was behind Delonte Cassell's nightclub.
delonte Cassell- that's... - Remember?
that's the club owner that was suspected of killing one of his own customers?
Yeah.
was a couple of weeks ago, right?
Yeah. What's that about? - Hang on a second.
the vic was Jimmy Ruiz.
says here he was found in a Dumpster a couple of blocks from the club.
Cassell and Ruiz got into a fight before Ruiz left the club, and that was the last time he was seen alive.
can you find out what happened with the case, what the verdict was?
Yeah.
looks like he got off; lack of evidence.
well, let's see if Denise has anything to say about it in her notes.
Yes, "Councilman Stafford ordered the street behind the club repaved the morning after Ruiz was shot.
why would the councilman have to act so fast?
I mean, what was his rush?
I'll betcha I know where I can dig up an answer.
look at that. It's a spent shell casing.
if I had to guess, it's from a nine-millimeter. And that's what Ruiz was shot with.
let's see what else we can get.
blood... and a whole lot of it.
we just found where Ruiz was shot.
put your business back in your pants and get the hell out of here.
and if you ever touch one of my girls like that again...
Hey, so we ended up pulling five nine-millimeter shell casings from the pavement behind the club.
that's not enough to charge Cassell in the reshooting.
you know? I need something that puts him at the scene. Yeah, I'm still looking.
so, are you coming over tonight? Yeah, of course.
you're the ASA on this? That's right.
that okay with you? - Yeah, it's fine.
but I think you should know that we think Councilman Stafford helped Cassell cover up this murder.
why would one of Miami's highest-ranking public officials help one of its dirtiest scumbags?
Cassell's a thug. That's a good question- I think we need to ask Cassell that.
what makes you think he'll talk?
maybe a nail in his coffin.
I got a print.
you know what this is, Delonte? It's a shell casing with your fingerprints on it.
and you know what it proves?
it proves that you killed Jimmy Ruiz two weeks ago.
so you say. Is my lawyer here yet?
Yeah, your lawyer can come here. But I'll tell you what, we got ASA Avery over here, and he's ready to make you a pretty sweet deal.
Really? What kind of deal we talking about?
well, that depends- tell us about your relationship with Councilman Stafford. Councilman?
do I look like the type who hangs with a councilman, suit?
no, you don't, but, uh, we got a work order request for the city here to repave the street that you shot Ruiz on, and, uh... it's signed by Councilman Stafford.
two hours after Ruiz died. That's not a coincidence.
I can make your life a whole lot easier if you just talk to us, Delonte.
shut your mouth, Delonte. Your words are attracting a lot of flies.
what the hell are you doing here? We represent Mr. Cassell.
well, we're allowed to have more than one client.
I mean, it helps with the very pricey overhead.
uh, now, could I see the evidence against Mr. Cassell?
Thanks, sir.
well, this just looks like a bunch of, uh, nine-millimeter shell casings.
so? They have Cassell's prints on them.
Oh. Better put the glasses on, then, huh? Hmm.
uh, Ruiz, he was killed with a nine-millimeter, correct?
Yeah, you and your client would know about that.
wait... wait a minute, there's a. 45 casing here on your lab table.
is that a. 45 ca... What do you think? Well, look at that.
that's a. 45 right there.
Yeah. Huh?
I mean, did you recover a. 45 shell casing from behind Mr. Cassell's club?
no, we didn't.
Oh. Really? - That wasn't there before.
Oh, yes, it was there. I mean, uh, that is your photo, sweetheart, yes? Well, now, if...
you didn't find a. 45 casing in the alley, where did it come from?
Oh! Unless it came from another case.
that's impossible.
I don't think so. That's called cross-contamination.
thus, the casings and the prints would be deemed inadmissible.
how the hell did this happen, Sam?
you see? Even ASA Avery, despite his lack of experience and cheap suits, he knows your case just flatlined.
so, I've been scanning through our database, looking at all of Vogel's other clients that we've arrested.
anything jump out?
you tell me- am I crazy, or do you see a pattern here?
Yeah! Vogel's clients are all felons, got hit with light slaps on the wrist when they should've gotten serious time.
thank you. Hung juries, acquittals, insufficient evidence- all thanks to Vogel.
wait, hang on. Go back.
that guy.
that's the guy from the hallway at Denise's apartment today.
that's the one that was having the fight with the woman that smacked me in the face.
the domestic you broke up this morning? Yeah.
Yeah, this guy,
booked last year on assault and battery. Charges were dropped.
so, Clyde owed Vogel big-time. Charges were dropped.
this guy staged the fight with the woman, so that I'd break our chain of custody.
okay, okay, he's coming.
so, do-do you want me to draw blood? Just make it sound real.
What'd you say, bitch?!
I said touch me again with those grimy hands, and you'll regret it.
louder. Louder. Come on, louder.
Vogel's blackmailing his clients to do his dirty work.
Vogel was blackmailing his clients, wasn't he, councilman?
and Denise found out about it, didn't she?
she came to me about it.
so, I confronted Vogel.
and that's how he found out about Denise, because you outed her, didn't you?
I never wanted her to get hurt. But she did get hurt.
she got killed right over there.
because of you, he killed her before she could publish what she uncovered about him:
how he used his clients to get other clients out of trouble.
what do you want from me, Horatio?
I need your testimony, councilman.
I can't testify against Vogel.
look what he does to people who cross him.
I- I have a family. You don't have a choice.
you do have a family, and they're gonna be next.
you need to think about that.
you need to think about it.
Yes, Natalia? You won't believe who just showed up.
I'm on my way.
Ah, Horatio, thank goodness you're here. I've been trying to get ahold of you for hours.
actually, I'm fresh off a conversation with Councilman Stafford.
well, that must have been a bit one-sided. Not a great conversationalist, is he?
well, come to think of it, neither are you. Till now.
all right, come on, what is it? What is it?
the suspense is killing me here. For starters, we know you had two of your clients go over and stage a fight at Denise Baines' house today so you could compromise evidence.
it seems, Mr. Vogel, that she found out the truth about you and lost her life for it.
Really?
well, do tell me, what is this truth exactly?
blackmail.
because we know you're blackmailing your clients like Councilman Stafford.
my dear, those are some wild, wild allegations.
Really?
listen, I can't speak to the blackmail part of this, but I can speak to the other allegations.
that won't be necessary at this time.
well, excuse me, I beg to differ there, Horatio.
miss Wade has something that she wants to tell you.
I hired Clyde Novak and another client to stage the fight at Denise Baines'.
I also hired that contract killer to poison her.
I acted alone.
I perceived a threat to my clients and acted independently.
feels better now, doesn't it, just to get that off your chest, Gabby.
now, listen, I'm gonna make sure you get the best representation.
hell, I may even do it myself.
thank you, Horatio.
without you, Miss Wade here would continue to be a blight
miss Wade? on my firm.
have you ever actually been to prison?
no.
well, then, I commend you on your blind sense of loyalty.
you know you don't have to be the scapegoat, right?
this is your only opportunity to tell us what he has on you.
miss Wade?
I'd like to give my official statement now.
without the councilman's testimony, we have nothing.
this whole thing falls on Gabrielle Wade.
Yeah, Vogel played us real good.
he was a step ahead of us the whole time. The judge agreed to this... What's going on?
because we discovered that... Son of a bitch.
the Miami-Dade Crime Lab mishandled evidence in a recent case.
what? Are you kidding me?
the CSI Samantha Owens used improper procedures, which puts into question not only her work Oh, my God.
on this particular case, but every single case that she's worked on including our client's,
Esteban Navarro's. Now, I can't say any more at this stage.
I will be making a statement later, but thank you so much.
it's a beautiful day; enjoy it. I am going for lunch.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
I'm guessing you heard?
Esteban Navarro's getting out, and all the cases that I processed evidence on are falling apart.
God, I guess I really screwed this up.
no, I don't think you did, Sam.
well, what are you talking about?
sorry to keep you waiting.
I've had another busy, busy, busy day.
well, of course, you'd know that, wouldn't you?
somebody compromised the evidence when they planted this casing; someone close to us who is working for Vogel.
Ryan, you don't think that I would even... Sam, let me ask you something.
what? Where did you meet your boyfriend?
Josh? At the gym, why?
Yeah, he did. Wh-what's the point?
Sam, he had access.
he was there.
you've been very loyal, my boy.
very loyal.
what do you want me to do now, Darren?
Wha...
you think that he planted the casing?
he's the assistant state attorney.
he would never... He had access to our trace lab.
well, I think the first order of business is to make sure that Lieutenant Caine and his CSIs never bother this law firm or any of its clients ever again.
if this is true, then I'm done. I'm finished.
not if I have anything to say about it.
you can't find us a cleared path?
wildlife knows to stay away from the public park.
you want to hunt game, cut your own path.
Oh, you're a badass, Denny.
still got the price tag on your pants.
leave it, dude.
30 days -- I can return them.
shut up.
we won't see any game if you guys keep yapping.
something's behind those peaks.
white-tailed deer feed around here.
well, let's go get them.
slow down.
find a spot...
...and then wait and let them come to you.
rob, you see anything?
no, Dennis?
watch carefully, gentlemen.
this is how it's done.
Hey, way to go, Rambo.
Hey, guys,
isn't it weird that they're running towards us?
don't run!
yell, wave your arms!
he'll think you're larger than you are!
yogi over there is one big-ass bear.
close to 800 pounds.
800 pounds and counting, Frank.
he's park services problem now.
our victim's Dennis West.
he's a hunter down from Tallahassee.
what do you think he was doing out here?
part of a hunting package.
guide's name is Chuck Greene.
Mr. Greene...
was this man an experienced hunter?
no. Not well trained.
more interested in the toys than bringing home any meat.
where were you during the attack?
right over there.
I tried to tell them don't... the worst thing you can do is turn your back and run.
I don't think the problem was turning his back.
take a look at this vest.
it's coated with some kind of substance.
vanilla gel.
that's bear lure.
so that would attract bears from miles, wouldn't it?
no hunter would knowingly lather himself up with that stuff.
so that means our victim was the bait.
gentlemen.
who would want Dennis' dead?
I don't know. We're not even from here.
no one knows us.
we're old college buddies and we're just here on a vacation package.
what kind of package?
it's called a "man-action."
it's a weekend trip. You know, vacation for men.
look, we're 60-hour-a-week desk jockeys, okay? We just needed to get out
Mr. Wolfe, check them, please.
are we radioactive or something?
I got moderate levels of glycerin and vanillin.
what that means, gentlemen, is the same attractant is all over you.
how'd it get on us?
that's what we need to find out, isn't it?
so how you doing?
good. I'm 100%.
lab get a new piece of equipment while I was outside?
Eric, this is the MiniRAE.
remember you showed it to me?
well, what are we using it for here?
well, vanilla' a pretty strong scent.
hopefully, the MiniRAE can follow the lure to its source.
that's right.
find the lure...
and we find the guy who put it on the hunters.
exactly.
got the first sign of blood -- starts here.
well, the victim was attacked here and probably dragged to where we found him.
Yeah, that bear came on him really quickly.
you know, these guys were all in decent shape.
I'm surprised they didn't get a little farther than they did.
they were running for their lives.
it was hardly a track meet.
wait a minute.
I've got something.
27 parts per million.
the, uh... scent's getting stronger.
it's up to 60.
get off my property.
Miami-Dade Police Department, sir.
we need to ask you a few questions.
what's your name?
you live here alone, Mr. Chadwick?
Yep.
we're investigating the murder of a hunter that happened this morning.
about a mile from here.
I don't know nothin' about that.
what do you use this glycerin for?
make my own lure.
wild game. Is that a crime?
not unless you used it for one.
Hey, you want to be careful with that, Hoss?
I don't need the bears come snooping around here.
this is vanilla.
just like on our dead hunter.
Hey, don't look at me.
I sell the stuff.
hunters
photographers
movie big shots
they all want to see what's hidden out here in the swamps.
you don't happen to have a list of the people you sell it to, do you?
I keep my receipts.
taxes.
well, I'm going to need to see that receipt book.
Mr. Greene, you bought homemade vanilla bear lure from a guy in the Glades, is that correct?
well, Billy makes the best stuff.
can virtually guarantee a bear sighting at any one of my hunts.
these city boys pay good money for their hunting weekends.
they want the whole experience.
does the whole experience include putting bear lure on them?
no way.
I just put a little bit on the trees nearby.
I'm real sorry about what happened, but it wasn't my fault.
all these guys wanted to do was party.
play around with the guns like they were big-game hunting.
that was the experience they wanted.
well, then I guess they got more than they paid for.
Hey, Alexx.
what you got on our dead hunter?
huh. Massive soft tissue damage.
liver, stomach and intestines are absent.
long bone fractures.
all consistent with mauling.
you know, the scene indicated he didn't run very far.
well, according to his medical records he was healthy.
save for a twisted ankle running the Boston Marathon last year.
so he should have been able to put more than a feet distance between him and that bear.
not with this knee, honey.
that bruise looks fresh.
baby boy had a comminuted fracture of the patella.
see the stellar pattern?
a busted kneecap.
you think he did that in the attack?
Nope. I would expect to see less of a fracture and more cartilage damage.
the bruise has a rectangular shape.
with a crisscross pattern.
I know exactly what made it.
that was fast.
butt of a rifle.
Dennis was put down by one of his own.
that is a bruise on Dennis West's leg.
we matched it to the stock of your rifle.
you crippled him.
it was chaos.
we were all scrambling.
I don't even remember what happened.
it's one thing to outrun soon, it's another thing to take them out.
sorry.
I can't remember any specific details.
so you going to arrest me or something?
not at this time.
well, okay.
let me know if you have any other questions.
all right, so we go over his every move.
Yes, we start where they stayed.
this is an awfully nice hotel room for a hunting weekend.
there's definitely more to the story.
that is a significant amount of blood.
Yeah, they tried to clean it up but they didn't realize the tile was loose.
bear's not the only killer in Miami.
I think we have another victim.
let's find out what these guys were really hunting.
there's more blood over here.
it's gravitational drop.
Yeah, maybe the suspect was injured.
you got all the hunters' DNA references at the Everglades scene, didn't you?
Yeah.
primed and ready to go.
I got Natalia waiting back at the lab.
hey
do you think this came with the room?
no, this place has a built-in sound system.
then I wonder who brought this here.
maybe we can identify the owner from the personal play list.
could lead us to our blood donor.
I have a theory.
you can tell a lot about a person by what they have on their MP3 player.
what you got?
with five Tori Amos albums on this thing, we're looking for a girl.
okay, but I need name.
there wasn't one on the player?
nothing.
but I am going to get you that name from the music on the player.
I mean, half the country has these songs.
see, when you purchase a song from the Mystx-Trax website, it comes from a server farm allowing Mystx-Trax to record the purchase.
they know every song a customer has downloaded.
and they gave your truly temporary access.
so if you match the downloaded songs on the player to Mystx's records, you can find out who owns it?
Aha.
and there it is.
told you it was a girl.
Yeah, it's mine.
it got stolen out of my car.
did you report it?
Oh, I'm sure you would've rushed right down to investigate.
what am I doing here exactly?
ms. Sivarro, I brought you in to make sure you're okay.
well, aren't you all ¨protect and serve.
you weren't at the Copper Palms.
and there's an indication that someone was injured there.
sorry.
it's like I said, my tunes got stolen out of my car last week.
ms. Sivarro...
it's Anna.
were you in the room with Andy, Rob and Dennis?
did someone try and hurt you?
look, you can check me out.
I don't have a mark on me.
I'll do whatever you need to prove that I wasn't there
fingerprints, blood.
I would appreciate it.
look, you don't have to protect me, Lieutenant.
I hope you're right... Anna.
we caught them going north on 95.
looked like they were heading out of town.
so, you boys headed north?
we wanted to inform Dennis' family in person.
were you going to tell them about the girl at the hotel last night?
going to have to wait.
we need to search your vehicle.
find something?
Yeah, looks like blood.
Pandora's box.
so is this animal blood?
well, we'll know it in a second.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
you gentlemen have a problem.
the blood is definitely human.
I will take a polygraph.
I don't know anything about that.
I will, too.
Yeah, well, you're going to have to take a ride with our officers first 'cause we got a lot of questions to ask you about what went on in the hotel room.
okay, so what now?
got some questions of our own to answer first.
starting with how did human blood get in this cooler?
were you ever away from your clients during the hunt?
no.
the first day, I drove them out.
and then this morning, they asked to meet me.
I thought that was a little strange, but it saved me a trip to South Beach.
is there any place along the road where they could've dumped the body?
at this end of the Glades, it's one way in and one way out.
so you're saying that I'll need to search the entire road.
maybe not.
did you tell me they all had bear lure on their clothes?
that's right.
I only put the scent in one spot.
great.
you can show me.
I put the lure all over these trees.
this must be the girl from the hotel room.
they must've thought the animals would finish her off.
lucky for us, they thought wrong.
so, gentlemen...
why don't you tell me what happened in that hotel room.
what do you mean?
we just hung out.
we drank, we played some cards.
was this before or after you dumped the girl in the Everglades?
I don't know what you're talking about.
we... we never... - Andy.
forget it.
Dennis is dead. Why are we still protecting him?
protecting him?
how do you mean?
Dennis is the one.
he was wasted. He wanted to party.
really party.
called for a stripper.
and it was way too intense for us, so we left to hit a couple clubs and when we got back it was already over.
what's wrong with her?
she's dead.
what do you mean she's dead?
she went to the bathroom, she came out, her nose was bleeding, and she collapsed.
so let me get this straight, gentlemen.
you're implicating a dead man?
it's true.
Dennis killed her.
we helped him move her, but that was it.
and moving a body isn't a crime-- I looked it up.
you looked it up, how studious of you.
I'm charging you with accessory after the fact.
look that up.
any ID on our dead girl?
no, but I ran the blood you collected from the hotel room.
does it match our female victim?
the blood drops do, but the blood that came from under the tile is from a male.
doesn't match our weekend warriors or their instructor.
how many people in that room?
that I cannot answer.
but I'm hoping to be able to tell you who he was.
out of prison.
he got right back on the horse, didn't he?
pull up his current info
the Pink Velvet Gentlemen's Club.
know where that is?
Yeah, I know.
detectives.
Joey Mazzaro.
what can I help you with today?
we need to ask you some questions, Mr. Mazzaro.
we're friends of the force.
we got enough friends.
but I bet you want to know who has enemies.
does he have enemies?
Rocco's one of my bodyguards here.
he's an enemy of every guy he won't let touch the girls.
what about last night?
he, uh, he get any threats?
Nope.
sent him out on a private last night with one of my dancers to the Copper Palms Hotel.
I need to talk to him.
Yeah, so do I.
he hasn't checked in. Neither has my girl.
well, I wouldn't expect a call from her.
Why's that?
we may have found her body dumped in the Glades.
Anna's dead?
did you say Anna?
Yeah. Anna Sivarro.
new kid.
shows some real talent.
she certainly does.
Anna, you lied to me.
you were in that hotel room last night.
I wasn't.
I was supposed to be.
but I gave the job to Tess.
is that Tess?
Yeah.
you gave the job to Tess because you knew whoever went would be in danger.
no.
I swear.
look, it was just a job.
I even gave her my music.
why didn't you want to go to work?
I was at a recording studio, trying to put together my demo.
your demo?
well, that's great. Now you're an artist?
give me a minute, will you?
Yeah.
Anna, tell me what happened.
I've been waiting for some studio time, so I can record some music.
an opening came up, so I asked Tess if she could cover for me.
when my session was over, I...
I called her.
when she didn't answer, I got worried.
okay. And so you went to the hotel.
to check on her, yes.
What'd you see?
a man.
it was dark, so I really couldn't make out his face.
he was carrying a body in a rug.
I knew from the tattoo that it was Rocco.
I knew that if Rocco was dead, something horrible must have happened to Tess.
I got scared, so I ran.
Anna, why didn't...
why didn't you mention this before?
cause I don't trust cops.
Anna, you need to trust me.
all right?
what can I help you with?
Alexx is taking a long time to document all the animal activity.
well, we need to find the bodyguard's body.
and according to Anna, it was transported in a rug.
well, Tripp's cadets are searching the area where we recovered Tess's body as we speak.
Yeah, but that cooler is too small to transport two bodies
I think the bodyguard was dumped somewhere else.
you think they used the rug from the hotel room and put it back?
Yeah, that's why I'm examining it right now.
hm. Well, in that case, trace on the rug could lead us to the body.
you found anything?
Oh, yeah, plant material from a Roystonea regia.
what's that?
it's a palm tree.
well, that doesn't exactly narrow the search.
this insect might.
what is it?
it's a royal palm bug.
and, uh, and how does that help us?
well, seeing as they only live in the palm trees, at least 12 feet in the air, what's this little guy doing on the ground?
this plant material has a clean, mechanized looking cut.
maybe the palms were being trimmed.
if we can find some freshly cut royal palms, maybe we can find our dump site.
and I think I know where to start
they were cutting palms when I was there this morning.
guess he didn't make it very far from the hotel, did he?
I'm sure someone wanted to get rid of the body before anyone discovered it.
there are at least five stab wounds here.
Yeah, and this shower liner explains why no blood got on the rug.
fiber from the rug?
no, I don't think so.
the rug was light green.
it's a feather.
Yeah, it's a feather from a duck.
wait a minute, you're saying that first of all there was a killer bear, and now there's a killer duck?
I'm saying the fiber you found on Rocco's body was eider duck.
it's used as fill in the most expensive, high-quality down jackets.
our dead hunter was wearing a down-filled vest.
but here's the interesting thing the bear shredded this vest, but I don't think he did this.
it's been cut.
okay.
all three of our hunters had knives.
Mm-hmm. The other two guys didn't have any cuts or tears in their jackets.
so his own knife cut the vest on the way out.
and Rocco had to be close enough to get the feathers on him.
Dennis killed the bodyguard.
Andy and Rob were telling the truth about Dennis.
so the dead guy is a murderer, but we still haven't confirmed who killed Tess Gowan.
I'm going to pay Alexx a visit.
lieutenant, I've got a business to run.
Yes, you do, and that business is pandering, Joey.
I employ strippers, and I don't encourage them to do anything more than that.
no, you may not, but either way, you get a cut, don't you?
as long as they pay, I don't ask.
Where's Anna? - You just missed her.
I got her out on a private.
Where'd you send her?
can't tell you.
he's one of those clients in high places.
he was a regular for Tess.
now that she's gone, I sent Anna.
she should like it.
he pays ten large for a private lap dance.
you and I both know that nobody pays $10, 000 to watch, do they?
lieutenant, you're so sure I'm a pimp
what does that make Anna?
why don't you tell me.
everything I do is legal, Lieutenant.
I don't have to tell you anything, and you can't do a thing about it.
that is where you're wrong.
Yeah, Frank.
I need an address , and make it quickly.
tell room service leave it on the table.
get back in here
what do you want?
supervisor O'Shay.
MDPD.
I'll call your director, we'll work this out.
supervisor, I have a source that says you're up here paying women $10, 000 for sex.
well, you see, this is our first date, we haven't done anything, so...
if you're trying to entrap me, it's not going to work.
ma'am, did the supervisor pay you for sex?
you're a lieutenant.
that means you're a smart man.
then you understand my conflict.
this is clearly solicitation, Supervisor.
and you realize you're never going to make captain if you go ahead with this.
you're making a career move.
so are you.
see you later, honey.
are you okay?
Joey said that I owed him.
he's blaming me for Tess.
he made me meet this guy.
I believe you.
she has a fractured sternum, associated spinal injuries.
something heavy compressed her chest.
like a person?
based on the shape of the congestion and cyanosis, related confluent petechiae -- then, yeah.
he sat on her.
cod was positional asphyxia.
now it doesn't happen quickly, so she struggled for a couple of minutes.
he had to have known she was suffocating.
well, that wasn't the only thing he did.
I took an oral swab.
semen doesn't live long in the mouth of a live person because of saliva, does it?
if that's positive, it was the last thing she did.
if it's positive, we have our killer.
why isn't Rob in here?
because he didn't kill Tess Gowan. You did that all by yourself.
well...
did Rob try to put this on me?
did... did he say something?
no. Your DNA said it all.
okay, okay, okay.
okay, listen, you've got to know this whole thing
it was just an accident, okay?
she... - Look.
I don't want to hear it.
it was not an accident.
Tess struggled under your weight, fighting for air, okay?
you're too heavy.
get off me. - Stop, stop.
I got carried away.
you raped and killed her.
how come Rob and Dennis didn't try and stop you?
they were passed out.
too many vodka shots.
they woke up and freaked out.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
what did you do?
I didn't do anything, man.
she j... she just died.
it's the bodyguard.
just... go tell him she left.
tell him she left.
but Denny killed the bodyguard.
and then you all covered it up together.
it would have worked if Denny hadn't grown a conscience.
I-I think we should go to the cops.
you crazy, man?
they fry in this state.
I don't think I can do this, guys, you know, even if we don't get caught.
Hey.
it's not just you who's going down here.
we're friends.
we stick together.
that's when Rob and I knew we had to get rid of Dennis.
rob wanted to shoot him.
wanted it to look like a hunting accident.
bear saved us the trouble.
well, actually, the bear ruined it for you.
if it hadn't have been for the bear attack, you might have gotten away with it.
but I am the one very glad you didn't.
clearing a path for Supervisor O'Shay, Rick?
it's not really a surprise the brass cut him loose on this.
you know how these things work.
all too well.
so you're going to fix the system by confronting him as he walks out of jail?
he took the same oath we did, didn't he?
I know he hired a prostitute, but you ought to save this battle for something bigger.
Rick, I am not letting this go.
if this goes down, I can't help you.
just like old this, huh?
and move that golf tournament to the end of the month.
Yes, I wouldn't make plans that far in advance, Supervisor.
hope you're not here asking for more funds, Lieutenant.
not feeling that generous towards your lab these days.
it's a pity because I have an idea for a new project.
wish I could help, but the budget's a bit tight.
might even have to have a few cutbacks.
stay away from Anna Sivarro.
how did you get this far in your career, Caine?
you really want to throw it all away over a girl like it?
you know what I'm curious about, Supervisor?
how an elected official like you affords $10, 000 for a dance.
I think we're done here, Lieutenant.
I sincerely hope so for your sake, Supervisor.
I really do.
thanks for meeting me here.
of course.
so you got Tess's killer?
that's right, we arrested him this afternoon.
good, good.
tess's mom will be glad.
how about you?
I'm still feeling guilty about Tess.
Anna, this is not your fault.
I know.
something tells me you don't buy that either when you try telling that to yourself.
I heard they let the big shark go.
that's true.
they did, but he will not bother you again.
you really do believe all that protect and serve stuff, don't you?
it's the only thing...
the only thing that I know how to do.
what the hell, man?
you can't find us a cleared path?
wildlife knows to stay away from the public park.
you want to hunt game, cut your own path.
Oh, you're a badass, Denny.
still got the price tag on your pants.
leave it, dude.
30 days -- I can return them.
shut up.
we won't see any game if you guys keep yapping.
something's behind those peaks.
white-tailed deer feed around here.
well, let's go get them.
slow down.
find a spot...
...and then wait and let them come to you.
rob, you see anything?
no, Dennis?
watch carefully, gentlemen.
this is how it's done.
Hey, way to go, Rambo.
Hey, guys,
isn't it weird that they're running towards us?
don't run!
yell, wave your arms!
he'll think you're larger than you are!
yogi over there is one big-ass bear.
close to 800 pounds.
800 pounds and counting, Frank.
he's park services problem now.
our victim's Dennis West.
he's a hunter down from Tallahassee.
what do you think he was doing out here?
part of a hunting package.
guide's name is Chuck Greene.
Mr. Greene...
was this man an experienced hunter?
no. Not well trained.
more interested in the toys than bringing home any meat.
where were you during the attack?
right over there.
I tried to tell them don't... the worst thing you can do is turn your back and run.
I don't think the problem was turning his back.
take a look at this vest.
it's coated with some kind of substance.
vanilla gel.
that's bear lure.
so that would attract bears from miles, wouldn't it?
no hunter would knowingly lather himself up with that stuff.
so that means our victim was the bait.
gentlemen.
who would want Dennis' dead?
I don't know. We're not even from here.
no one knows us.
we're old college buddies and we're just here on a vacation package.
what kind of package?
it's called a "man-action."
it's a weekend trip. You know, vacation for men.
look, we're 60-hour-a-week desk jockeys, okay? We just needed to get out
Mr. Wolfe, check them, please.
are we radioactive or something?
I got moderate levels of glycerin and vanillin.
what that means, gentlemen, is the same attractant is all over you.
how'd it get on us?
that's what we need to find out, isn't it?
so how you doing?
good. I'm 100%.
lab get a new piece of equipment while I was outside?
Eric, this is the MiniRAE.
remember you showed it to me?
well, what are we using it for here?
well, vanilla' a pretty strong scent.
hopefully, the MiniRAE can follow the lure to its source.
that's right.
find the lure...
and we find the guy who put it on the hunters.
exactly.
got the first sign of blood -- starts here.
well, the victim was attacked here and probably dragged to where we found him.
Yeah, that bear came on him really quickly.
you know, these guys were all in decent shape.
I'm surprised they didn't get a little farther than they did.
they were running for their lives.
it was hardly a track meet.
wait a minute.
I've got something.
27 parts per million.
the, uh... scent's getting stronger.
it's up to 60.
get off my property.
Miami-Dade Police Department, sir.
we need to ask you a few questions.
what's your name?
you live here alone, Mr. Chadwick?
Yep.
we're investigating the murder of a hunter that happened this morning.
about a mile from here.
I don't know nothin' about that.
what do you use this glycerin for?
make my own lure.
wild game. Is that a crime?
not unless you used it for one.
Hey, you want to be careful with that, Hoss?
I don't need the bears come snooping around here.
this is vanilla.
just like on our dead hunter.
Hey, don't look at me.
I sell the stuff.
hunters
photographers
movie big shots
they all want to see what's hidden out here in the swamps.
you don't happen to have a list of the people you sell it to, do you?
I keep my receipts.
taxes.
well, I'm going to need to see that receipt book.
Mr. Greene, you bought homemade vanilla bear lure from a guy in the Glades, is that correct?
well, Billy makes the best stuff.
can virtually guarantee a bear sighting at any one of my hunts.
these city boys pay good money for their hunting weekends.
they want the whole experience.
does the whole experience include putting bear lure on them?
no way.
I just put a little bit on the trees nearby.
I'm real sorry about what happened, but it wasn't my fault.
all these guys wanted to do was party.
play around with the guns like they were big-game hunting.
that was the experience they wanted.
well, then I guess they got more than they paid for.
Hey, Alexx.
what you got on our dead hunter?
huh. Massive soft tissue damage.
liver, stomach and intestines are absent.
long bone fractures.
all consistent with mauling.
you know, the scene indicated he didn't run very far.
well, according to his medical records he was healthy.
save for a twisted ankle running the Boston Marathon last year.
so he should have been able to put more than a feet distance between him and that bear.
not with this knee, honey.
that bruise looks fresh.
baby boy had a comminuted fracture of the patella.
see the stellar pattern?
a busted kneecap.
you think he did that in the attack?
Nope. I would expect to see less of a fracture and more cartilage damage.
the bruise has a rectangular shape.
with a crisscross pattern.
I know exactly what made it.
that was fast.
butt of a rifle.
Dennis was put down by one of his own.
that is a bruise on Dennis West's leg.
we matched it to the stock of your rifle.
you crippled him.
it was chaos.
we were all scrambling.
I don't even remember what happened.
it's one thing to outrun soon, it's another thing to take them out.
sorry.
I can't remember any specific details.
so you going to arrest me or something?
not at this time.
well, okay.
let me know if you have any other questions.
all right, so we go over his every move.
Yes, we start where they stayed.
this is an awfully nice hotel room for a hunting weekend.
there's definitely more to the story.
that is a significant amount of blood.
Yeah, they tried to clean it up but they didn't realize the tile was loose.
bear's not the only killer in Miami.
I think we have another victim.
let's find out what these guys were really hunting.
there's more blood over here.
it's gravitational drop.
Yeah, maybe the suspect was injured.
you got all the hunters' DNA references at the Everglades scene, didn't you?
Yeah.
primed and ready to go.
I got Natalia waiting back at the lab.
hey
do you think this came with the room?
no, this place has a built-in sound system.
then I wonder who brought this here.
maybe we can identify the owner from the personal play list.
could lead us to our blood donor.
I have a theory.
you can tell a lot about a person by what they have on their MP3 player.
what you got?
with five Tori Amos albums on this thing, we're looking for a girl.
okay, but I need name.
there wasn't one on the player?
nothing.
but I am going to get you that name from the music on the player.
I mean, half the country has these songs.
see, when you purchase a song from the Mystx-Trax website, it comes from a server farm allowing Mystx-Trax to record the purchase.
they know every song a customer has downloaded.
and they gave your truly temporary access.
so if you match the downloaded songs on the player to Mystx's records, you can find out who owns it?
Aha.
and there it is.
told you it was a girl.
Yeah, it's mine.
it got stolen out of my car.
did you report it?
Oh, I'm sure you would've rushed right down to investigate.
what am I doing here exactly?
ms. Sivarro, I brought you in to make sure you're okay.
well, aren't you all ¨protect and serve.
you weren't at the Copper Palms.
and there's an indication that someone was injured there.
sorry.
it's like I said, my tunes got stolen out of my car last week.
ms. Sivarro...
it's Anna.
were you in the room with Andy, Rob and Dennis?
did someone try and hurt you?
look, you can check me out.
I don't have a mark on me.
I'll do whatever you need to prove that I wasn't there
fingerprints, blood.
I would appreciate it.
look, you don't have to protect me, Lieutenant.
I hope you're right... Anna.
we caught them going north on 95.
looked like they were heading out of town.
so, you boys headed north?
we wanted to inform Dennis' family in person.
were you going to tell them about the girl at the hotel last night?
going to have to wait.
we need to search your vehicle.
find something?
Yeah, looks like blood.
Pandora's box.
so is this animal blood?
well, we'll know it in a second.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
you gentlemen have a problem.
the blood is definitely human.
I will take a polygraph.
I don't know anything about that.
I will, too.
Yeah, well, you're going to have to take a ride with our officers first 'cause we got a lot of questions to ask you about what went on in the hotel room.
okay, so what now?
got some questions of our own to answer first.
starting with how did human blood get in this cooler?
were you ever away from your clients during the hunt?
no.
the first day, I drove them out.
and then this morning, they asked to meet me.
I thought that was a little strange, but it saved me a trip to South Beach.
is there any place along the road where they could've dumped the body?
at this end of the Glades, it's one way in and one way out.
so you're saying that I'll need to search the entire road.
maybe not.
did you tell me they all had bear lure on their clothes?
that's right.
I only put the scent in one spot.
great.
you can show me.
I put the lure all over these trees.
this must be the girl from the hotel room.
they must've thought the animals would finish her off.
lucky for us, they thought wrong.
so, gentlemen...
why don't you tell me what happened in that hotel room.
what do you mean?
we just hung out.
we drank, we played some cards.
was this before or after you dumped the girl in the Everglades?
I don't know what you're talking about.
we... we never... - Andy.
forget it.
Dennis is dead. Why are we still protecting him?
protecting him?
how do you mean?
Dennis is the one.
he was wasted. He wanted to party.
really party.
called for a stripper.
and it was way too intense for us, so we left to hit a couple clubs and when we got back it was already over.
what's wrong with her?
she's dead.
what do you mean she's dead?
she went to the bathroom, she came out, her nose was bleeding, and she collapsed.
so let me get this straight, gentlemen.
you're implicating a dead man?
it's true.
Dennis killed her.
we helped him move her, but that was it.
and moving a body isn't a crime-- I looked it up.
you looked it up, how studious of you.
I'm charging you with accessory after the fact.
look that up.
any ID on our dead girl?
no, but I ran the blood you collected from the hotel room.
does it match our female victim?
the blood drops do, but the blood that came from under the tile is from a male.
doesn't match our weekend warriors or their instructor.
how many people in that room?
that I cannot answer.
but I'm hoping to be able to tell you who he was.
out of prison.
he got right back on the horse, didn't he?
pull up his current info
the Pink Velvet Gentlemen's Club.
know where that is?
Yeah, I know.
detectives.
Joey Mazzaro.
what can I help you with today?
we need to ask you some questions, Mr. Mazzaro.
we're friends of the force.
we got enough friends.
but I bet you want to know who has enemies.
does he have enemies?
Rocco's one of my bodyguards here.
he's an enemy of every guy he won't let touch the girls.
what about last night?
he, uh, he get any threats?
Nope.
sent him out on a private last night with one of my dancers to the Copper Palms Hotel.
I need to talk to him.
Yeah, so do I.
he hasn't checked in. Neither has my girl.
well, I wouldn't expect a call from her.
Why's that?
we may have found her body dumped in the Glades.
Anna's dead?
did you say Anna?
Yeah. Anna Sivarro.
new kid.
shows some real talent.
she certainly does.
Anna, you lied to me.
you were in that hotel room last night.
I wasn't.
I was supposed to be.
but I gave the job to Tess.
is that Tess?
Yeah.
you gave the job to Tess because you knew whoever went would be in danger.
no.
I swear.
look, it was just a job.
I even gave her my music.
why didn't you want to go to work?
I was at a recording studio, trying to put together my demo.
your demo?
well, that's great. Now you're an artist?
give me a minute, will you?
Yeah.
Anna, tell me what happened.
I've been waiting for some studio time, so I can record some music.
an opening came up, so I asked Tess if she could cover for me.
when my session was over, I...
I called her.
when she didn't answer, I got worried.
okay. And so you went to the hotel.
to check on her, yes.
What'd you see?
a man.
it was dark, so I really couldn't make out his face.
he was carrying a body in a rug.
I knew from the tattoo that it was Rocco.
I knew that if Rocco was dead, something horrible must have happened to Tess.
I got scared, so I ran.
Anna, why didn't...
why didn't you mention this before?
cause I don't trust cops.
Anna, you need to trust me.
all right?
what can I help you with?
Alexx is taking a long time to document all the animal activity.
well, we need to find the bodyguard's body.
and according to Anna, it was transported in a rug.
well, Tripp's cadets are searching the area where we recovered Tess's body as we speak.
Yeah, but that cooler is too small to transport two bodies
I think the bodyguard was dumped somewhere else.
you think they used the rug from the hotel room and put it back?
Yeah, that's why I'm examining it right now.
hm. Well, in that case, trace on the rug could lead us to the body.
you found anything?
Oh, yeah, plant material from a Roystonea regia.
what's that?
it's a palm tree.
well, that doesn't exactly narrow the search.
this insect might.
what is it?
it's a royal palm bug.
and, uh, and how does that help us?
well, seeing as they only live in the palm trees, at least 12 feet in the air, what's this little guy doing on the ground?
this plant material has a clean, mechanized looking cut.
maybe the palms were being trimmed.
if we can find some freshly cut royal palms, maybe we can find our dump site.
and I think I know where to start
they were cutting palms when I was there this morning.
guess he didn't make it very far from the hotel, did he?
I'm sure someone wanted to get rid of the body before anyone discovered it.
there are at least five stab wounds here.
Yeah, and this shower liner explains why no blood got on the rug.
fiber from the rug?
no, I don't think so.
the rug was light green.
it's a feather.
Yeah, it's a feather from a duck.
wait a minute, you're saying that first of all there was a killer bear, and now there's a killer duck?
I'm saying the fiber you found on Rocco's body was eider duck.
it's used as fill in the most expensive, high-quality down jackets.
our dead hunter was wearing a down-filled vest.
but here's the interesting thing the bear shredded this vest, but I don't think he did this.
it's been cut.
okay.
all three of our hunters had knives.
Mm-hmm. The other two guys didn't have any cuts or tears in their jackets.
so his own knife cut the vest on the way out.
and Rocco had to be close enough to get the feathers on him.
Dennis killed the bodyguard.
Andy and Rob were telling the truth about Dennis.
so the dead guy is a murderer, but we still haven't confirmed who killed Tess Gowan.
I'm going to pay Alexx a visit.
lieutenant, I've got a business to run.
Yes, you do, and that business is pandering, Joey.
I employ strippers, and I don't encourage them to do anything more than that.
no, you may not, but either way, you get a cut, don't you?
as long as they pay, I don't ask.
Where's Anna? - You just missed her.
I got her out on a private.
Where'd you send her?
can't tell you.
he's one of those clients in high places.
he was a regular for Tess.
now that she's gone, I sent Anna.
she should like it.
he pays ten large for a private lap dance.
you and I both know that nobody pays $10, 000 to watch, do they?
lieutenant, you're so sure I'm a pimp
what does that make Anna?
why don't you tell me.
everything I do is legal, Lieutenant.
I don't have to tell you anything, and you can't do a thing about it.
that is where you're wrong.
Yeah, Frank.
I need an address , and make it quickly.
tell room service leave it on the table.
get back in here
what do you want?
supervisor O'Shay.
MDPD.
I'll call your director, we'll work this out.
supervisor, I have a source that says you're up here paying women $10, 000 for sex.
well, you see, this is our first date, we haven't done anything, so...
if you're trying to entrap me, it's not going to work.
ma'am, did the supervisor pay you for sex?
you're a lieutenant.
that means you're a smart man.
then you understand my conflict.
this is clearly solicitation, Supervisor.
and you realize you're never going to make captain if you go ahead with this.
you're making a career move.
so are you.
see you later, honey.
are you okay?
Joey said that I owed him.
he's blaming me for Tess.
he made me meet this guy.
I believe you.
she has a fractured sternum, associated spinal injuries.
something heavy compressed her chest.
like a person?
based on the shape of the congestion and cyanosis, related confluent petechiae -- then, yeah.
he sat on her.
cod was positional asphyxia.
now it doesn't happen quickly, so she struggled for a couple of minutes.
he had to have known she was suffocating.
well, that wasn't the only thing he did.
I took an oral swab.
semen doesn't live long in the mouth of a live person because of saliva, does it?
if that's positive, it was the last thing she did.
if it's positive, we have our killer.
why isn't Rob in here?
because he didn't kill Tess Gowan. You did that all by yourself.
well...
did Rob try to put this on me?
did... did he say something?
no. Your DNA said it all.
okay, okay, okay.
okay, listen, you've got to know this whole thing
it was just an accident, okay?
she... - Look.
I don't want to hear it.
it was not an accident.
Tess struggled under your weight, fighting for air, okay?
you're too heavy.
get off me. - Stop, stop.
I got carried away.
you raped and killed her.
how come Rob and Dennis didn't try and stop you?
they were passed out.
too many vodka shots.
they woke up and freaked out.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
what did you do?
I didn't do anything, man.
she j... she just died.
it's the bodyguard.
just... go tell him she left.
tell him she left.
but Denny killed the bodyguard.
and then you all covered it up together.
it would have worked if Denny hadn't grown a conscience.
I-I think we should go to the cops.
you crazy, man?
they fry in this state.
I don't think I can do this, guys, you know, even if we don't get caught.
Hey.
it's not just you who's going down here.
we're friends.
we stick together.
that's when Rob and I knew we had to get rid of Dennis.
rob wanted to shoot him.
wanted it to look like a hunting accident.
bear saved us the trouble.
well, actually, the bear ruined it for you.
if it hadn't have been for the bear attack, you might have gotten away with it.
but I am the one very glad you didn't.
clearing a path for Supervisor O'Shay, Rick?
it's not really a surprise the brass cut him loose on this.
you know how these things work.
all too well.
so you're going to fix the system by confronting him as he walks out of jail?
he took the same oath we did, didn't he?
I know he hired a prostitute, but you ought to save this battle for something bigger.
Rick, I am not letting this go.
if this goes down, I can't help you.
just like old this, huh?
and move that golf tournament to the end of the month.
Yes, I wouldn't make plans that far in advance, Supervisor.
hope you're not here asking for more funds, Lieutenant.
not feeling that generous towards your lab these days.
it's a pity because I have an idea for a new project.
wish I could help, but the budget's a bit tight.
might even have to have a few cutbacks.
stay away from Anna Sivarro.
how did you get this far in your career, Caine?
you really want to throw it all away over a girl like it?
you know what I'm curious about, Supervisor?
how an elected official like you affords $10, 000 for a dance.
I think we're done here, Lieutenant.
I sincerely hope so for your sake, Supervisor.
I really do.
thanks for meeting me here.
of course.
so you got Tess's killer?
that's right, we arrested him this afternoon.
good, good.
tess's mom will be glad.
how about you?
I'm still feeling guilty about Tess.
Anna, this is not your fault.
I know.
something tells me you don't buy that either when you try telling that to yourself.
I heard they let the big shark go.
that's true.
they did, but he will not bother you again.
you really do believe all that protect and serve stuff, don't you?
it's the only thing...
the only thing that I know how to do.
excuse me.
excuse me. If I may have your attention, everyone, please.
thank you. Thank you.
many people criticized my husband and me for wanting to turn prime, tourist-friendly real estate into a children's hospital.
but they don't understand.
those young lives are the future.
now, the wealthy often find it easier to part with their money than their time.
right?
but in doing both, you have put your Palm Beach counterparts to shame.
and so, a toast!
to you!
Cheers!
can't say there's a protocol for this one, Horatio.
going to have to keep our guy chilled until I can post him.
the murder weapon is, uh, melting.
alexx, I think someone got here first.
take a look at that.
whoa.
a gunshot wound.
right. Some of the guests heard it. Shot in the light of day in a house filled with people?
that's cold-blooded, Horatio.
it's as cold as ice.
open
open
officer?
you seem to be the one in charge here.
I guess that depends who you ask.
my name's Josh Brockner.
I'm Mr. Whitford's...
uh... was Mr. Whitford's executive assistant.
if I can be of any help.
who do you think would want to kill him, Josh?
well, he was a real estate developer
one of the richest and most influential in Miami.
swam with sharks on a daily basis.
for every friend, he had three enemies.
okay, I need a list of all of those people.
sure, anything.
I just want to help get
Mrs. Whitford home to her baby.
she's really been through a lot.
and you will, as soon as you're done here.
back in line, please.
Hey.
is this where the victim was shot?
Yeah.
right there.
then he fell backwards, over the balcony.
killer made it easier for us.
he left the gun behind.
.38 with a two-inch barrel.
I'll get it to Firearms.
wait a minute, Eric.
this is another blood drop.
separate from the rest.
and it's still wet, so it could be from our killer.
I'll have Valera run it, ASAP.
it's okay, you know.
what is?
to experience a relearning curve.
what are you talking about?
evidence markers three and four.
you put two markers on the same blood drop, man.
I can't make a simple mistake?
that's what I kept telling myself last year.
after I got shot.
I'm fine, Wolfe.
and I'd be even better if everyone would stop giving me the third degree.
I said that, too.
Hey, Alexx, were you able to recover the projectile from the victim yet?
Yeah. Sing GSW.
round penetrated the chest.
came to rest in the pericardial sack, which caused massive internal bleeding.
but Whitford's days were already numbered.
there was massive scar tissue on the muscle, which caused several of the vessels to become narrow or completely occluded.
Wow. Not even 40 years old and he's already had a heart attack.
doesn't mean he didn't do some hard living.
he's got a perforated stum in the nasal cavity.
Ah.
chronic cocaine use.
Mm-hmm. His heart would've given out soon enough.
the killer just beat him to it.
which brings us back to the bullet.
looks like a . 38.
it's the same caliber as the weapon Ryan recovered.
it's in nice shape.
should make my job a lot easier.
Thanks, Alexx.
I'll see you later.
Hey. - Hey.
Eric said the . 38 came back with no viable prints.
unfortunately, no.
I was however able to match the spent round to the recovered firearm, making it a definite as our murder weapon.
and the serial number wasn't altered.
so Automated Firearms is searching for a registered owner.
there you go.
the trust fund playboy, who's always in Ocean Drive.
that's the guy.
I wonder what Neil has to say for himself.
Mr. Massey, we recovered your firearm from a murder scene.
my . 38?
that thing was stolen, few years ago.
is that a fact?
it's hard to find good help.
people think just because I got money that I don't notice when things disappear.
so I shouldn't expect to uncover a police report along the way.
Nah.
I got better things to do than to get someone into a beef with INS.
I understand. Where were you this morning?
at my family's attorney's office, getting my monthly allowance.
my parents get some kind of a thrill out of tightening the reins.
well, we share a common interest.
I'm going to keep you in a holding cell till I can verify your story, okay?
here's another blood drop.
separate from the rest.
it could be from our killer.
I'll have Valera run it, ASAP.
I hope you got something on that blood.
Neil Massey's story checked out, and we had to spring him.
well, I can see why.
that lone blood drop you found, it came back XX.
female?
Yep. - So whose blood is it?
did you check it against the reference samples?
everyone who attended the party.
and guess what?
the blood's consistent with Ashley Whitford.
the victim's wife?
Uh-huh.
all right, thanks.
I got a nose bleed, about five minutes before my speech.
public speaking makes me nervous.
so you admit though that you were in the bathroom.
Yes, I was.
but I was alone.
my husband hadn't arrived yet.
so you and your husband, you put on this event together.
when you gave your speech, he's not there with you?
we usually arrive separately.
he hates these events.
always just shows up at the end.
I swear I didn't see him until...
Ashley, let's just-- let's be honest, okay?
this doesn't look good.
you stood to gain everything from your husband's death.
we're talking a huge estate.
right.
because everything in this world's about money.
I lost a husband today.
and my baby just lost his father.
I did not kill Dominic.
OK.
Thanks, Ms. Whitford.
we'll be in touch.
what do you think?
I don't buy it.
well, the evidence is equivocal.
the blood drop she left behind was gravitational.
that's consistent with a nosebleed.
and her alibi's about as airtight as you can get.
because she was downstairs when he fell.
she forgot her glasses.
I'll catch up to her.
Hey.
Hey, your glasses.
what have we got?
when I chased Ashley outside of MDPD,
I got worried I was seeing things, so I... compared the fingerprints off her sunglasses the sample print we took at the party.
they don't match.
the Ashley Whitford we interviewed-- it's not her.
Eric, I think it's likely that
Ashley Whitford has an identical twin.
and she played us.
they played us.
they're playing everyone.
would you like your sunglasses back?
miss...?
she's my sister.
Yeah.
boy, you guys really tried to pull a face one.
which one of you murdered Dominic Whitford?
neither.
just because we're twins doesn't make us murderers.
it doesn't make you innocent either, Cayla.
you just posed as your sister.
that means you're looking at obstruction of justice and giving false information.
but everything Cayla said was true.
I told her exactly what to say to you guys.
it may as we have been me.
so do you remember what to say?
don't worry, Ashley.
I've always been great being you.
I'll call you when I'm done?
wait.
my ring.
but it wasn't you, Ashley.
were you afraid that you couldn't pull off the lies?
I just wanted to be with my son.
he's only a year old.
he doesn't get that his daddy is never coming home.
Ashley could barely speak to anyone, let alone cops.
we've always covered for each other.
you know, like tests in school, creepy dates.
and Dominic knew you were twins?
no.
he didn't need to know.
interesting.
makes it easier to cover up murder.
Ashley did not kill Dominic.
here's the thing.
you have different fingerprints, but...
identical twins share the same DNA, so the blood that we found at the crime scene puts you there as well.
I told you guys already.
it's mine.
my nose started bleeding.
no, actually, Cayla told us that, which means that I don't know really who is covering for who.
okay, Ashley was outside at the time, and I wasn't even at the party, okay?
I was at the gym.
feel free to check.
I will. - Okay.
I will. In fact, I'll double check.
Hey, I got your message.
there's new information?
I checked Dominic Whitford's medical records.
in 39 years, he's only checked into the hospital twice.
he jammed a Q-tip in his ear when he was 11
and was treated for a case of pleurisy at 27.
otherwise, perfect health.
there's nothing anywhere about a myocardial infarction.
well, if he didn't have a heart attack, then what caused the s tissue on his heart muscle?
a heart attack.
the twins thought they had a secret.
Whitford had an even bigger secret.
wait a minute.
are you saying that this is not Dominic Whitford?
are you saying this is another twin?
no, but he tried really hard to be him.
I don't know what you mean.
see this scar along the hairline?
well, this is where plastic surgeons like to hide their handiwork.
he had a face lift.
correct.
but not to lose a few wrinkles.
he changed his whole appearance.
scars inside the mouth.
that indicates cheek implants and chin augmentation.
there's another scar right here.
a bilateral otoplasty.
had both ears pinned back, capped it off with a nose job and color contact lenses.
we're not talking a reasonable facsimile, honey.
this man paid big money.
maybe Dominic Whitford picked up the tab.
you think he was paid to be Dominic's look-alike?
I don't know.
he's a hotshot real estate developer, needs to be in two places at once.
and he had a lot of enemies.
I mean, someone thought they had killed him.
you know, if that's true,
Dominic Whitford is still alive.
Mr. Whitford has had at least three attempts on his life.
development displaces people and people get angry.
you should see the hate mail.
so you knew he had a look-alike.
knew? I... I helped hire the guy.
he gave up his identity for 100K a year.
he also gave up his life.
so you knew the victim wasn't Whitford, and you knew that we were investigating the murder of a look-alike, and yet you said nothing.
Why?
I couldn't.
when Greg nt down...
I- I thought my boss could be in danger.
h- He went to great lengths to create this decoy.
I'm the only one who knows.
even his wife doesn't know.
well, if your boss is in danger, we need to find him.
do you have any idea where he is?
I don't know.
I haven't been able to reach him all day.
okay, let me put it to you this way.
Whitford, like yourself, could be a suspect, so I suggest that you start cooperating with me, all right?
he's been spending a lot of time at the Ambrose Estates property.
they just broke ground.
that wasn't so bad, was it?
Thanks, leave right now.
the dead shall rise.
you seem to be in a hurry, Mr. Whitford.
uh, no, I didn't realize you guys were cops.
I... I heard about the shooting.
figured I might be next.
Mr. Whitford, I'll be frank.
either you killed Greg Ramsey or you know who did.
my look-alike does promotional events for me all the time.
given, this is obviously the worst-case scenario, but... he knew the risks.
what do you mean risks?
when you're as high profile as I am, sometimes even leaving the house is dangerous.
I'm a very recognizable person in Miami.
I just used my double for added security, plain and simple.
go.
maybe you were attempting to fake your own death to disappear, and your double became expendable.
no.
I had nothing to do with Greg Ramsey's death.
excuse me.
Mr. Wolfe.
the cadaver dogs, please.
H.
I had no idea anyone was buried here.
well, you know, this isn't the first dead body you've been associated with today.
I don't understand.
I really don't.
I mean, I swear I'm innocent.
then you'll be okay with protective custody till we prove it.
Mr. Whitford, have you called your wife and told her that you're still alive?
no, I figured it was safer her not knowing.
you know, until I got to the bottom of it.
well, then you're both in for a big surprise.
Hi. - Hey.
that's the girl from the construction site.
Yeah, I did my best to put the poor baby back together.
almost done fluoroscoping.
were you able to get an ID?
dental records match on a missing person.
Mia Graham? That name sounds so familiar.
I think this girl used to work for Dominic Whitford.
I came across her name in one of his files.
cod's pressed skull fracture.
any thoughts on what the murder weapon might be?
I think you might have more luck identifying what cut her up.
I guess saw marks are easier to identify than depression marks.
wait a minute.
I think I just found a piece of it.
has teeth. Looks like a saw blade.
it could be from a, uh...
sawzall?
think you can get a print?
I know I can.
your boss said you'd be here, Josh.
and I guess he was right.
I, uh, you know, I was just... cleaning up.
Yes, I can imagine you are.
well, I run this job site so...
anything goes missing, I take the hit.
I would get used to that if I were you.
we found your fingerprint on the blade that killed Mia Graham, your former supervisor.
it's a perfect match.
why would I kill her?
you killed Mia because she was Mr. Whitford's assistant and you wanted her job
a job would have been out of your reach.
someday all this will be yours.
Really? You think Mr. Whitford will let me manage the site? No.
you'll be running the machinery.
I've told Dominic that that's on a par with your skill level.
except for the heavy stuff.
never figured anyone would find her.
and that's because killers like you, Josh, never do。
take him.
we're not going to tell Ashley her husband's still alive?
that seems kind of cruel.
Hey, they don't want to be straight with us, we return the favor.
besides, H. doesn't want anyone in on this until we know who we can trust.
all right.
I have a police report from the first attempt on Dominic Whitford's life.
you think it was the same person tried again today?
if at first you don't succeed...
says here Mr. and Mrs. Whitford were shot at outside the country club polo grounds.
Ashley was eight months pregnant.
bullet missed them both, but Ashley fell.
she was rushed to the hospital for an emergency C-section.
looks like the only piece of ballistic evidence we got was this 9mm round.
couldn't tie it back to a gun.
tell you what we do have, we have a list of witnesses and suspects.
anyone of interest?
Yeah.
take a look at this.
same guy that owns the gun involved in the shooting this morning.
now he's connected to two attempts on Whitford's life.
so I'm thinking that shooting at Dominic Whitford was target practice?
Mr. Massey? - I assume you're talking about the incident at the country club.
I am talking about the incident at the country club.
I was at the clubhouse when it happened.
a cop questioned me as a witness not a suspect.
it was a year ago and they agree it was a coincidence.
why didn't you mention it before?
because I knew it would look bad.
but believe me, it was...
just a coincidence.
seeing as Dominic Whitford is dead,
I don't believe there are any coincidences, and I think a jury will agree with me.
let's book him.
get him out.
wait a minute.
wait a minute...
I... I did shoot at the Whitfords last year.
but it had nothing to do with Dominic.
I was aiming at his wife.
his wife?
why Whitford's wife?
we dated three years ago.
I kept a lot of cash in the house and one day it was gone.
along with my . 38.
now Ashley was with me when it happened, so I thought it couldn't have been her.
but then I found out about her sister.
why didn't you report it?
no proof.
and to be honest,
I was embarrassed.
you know, duped by twins.
like a joke.
I felt like I was stuck in one of them gum commercials.
well...
since you've copped to it, you're going to be stuck in prison for attempted murder.
I... I just wanted to scare her.
look, you're lucky she didn't lose the baby.
if she had, you'd be in there for murder.
let's go.
Hey, Natalia. It's Calleigh.
listen, I think we need to pay the twins another visit.
and would you pick up a copy of Ocean Drive on your way in?
Oh, you'll see.
Bye.
what stolen money? Neil's lying.
Oh, I... I'm sure. I can't wait to hear the truth.
he was scary jealous.
he went into a rage when I left him for Dominic.
the guy was practically stalking Ashley.
he couldn't kill Ashley, so he went after Dominic.
I'm just grateful that Noah's safe.
yes to him. Uh...
you had a cesarean delivery, right?
I had to. During the shooting, I fell.
there was bleeding.
well, maybe you can explain this picture that I found of you in Ocean Drive magazine.
it's really cute to you.
but there's no scar.
Oh...
they must have airbrushed it.
yeah? - Yeah.
do you know that I can get a warrant to have your body searched for surgical scars?
all right.
Ashley found out she couldn't have children.
I had the baby, okay.
so you covered for each other like back in high school, but this time you slept with him.
I couldn't tell him.
I was afraid that he'd leave me.
children were so important to him.
hey... give me a second.
okay? - Okay.
any tips?
he likes... enthusiasm.
blow in his ear, it'll be over before you know it.
ready?
as I'm ever going to be.
you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
so you're telling me that you switched places for nine whole months without Dominic knowing?
Yes. I know it was wrong.
Yeah, you are wrong, Cayla, because we checked your passport and you weren't in the country.
you were in Africa the entire pregnancy.
I already called Child Services.
they're going to take Noah away and send him to foster care unless you tell me the whole truth right now.
wait!
please don't take him.
he's mine. Noah's mine.
triplets.
that's... well, that's...
perfect.
all three of you are coming with me.
I really shouldn't talk without Ashley and Cayla.
I already spoke to them, I'd like to hear your story.
I don't know how it got this far.
why don't you tell me how it started?
it was always just a game.
cheating on tests.
fooling bosses, boyfriends.
so you three went after Dominic?
we grew up poor.
this was a way to make sure we were okay forever.
Ashley was supposed to marry him.
anytime it got old, Cayla and I'd step in.
then Ashley would divorce him, and then get a big chunk of change.
but he wanted a pregnant.
well, then Ashley had to get pregnant since the money always goes with the kid.
but... she couldn't do it.
Ashley's infertile.
so I did.
having a baby-- that is not a game.
I know.
I love Noah so much.
I miss him.
did you kill Dominic so that you could get him back?
no. God, no.
dom was actually a really good guy.
who killed him?
we have the blood from the crime scene.
we know it was one of you.
I don't know.
you're going to lose Noah, Beth, if you don't help me out here.
I'm sorry.
H. , I heard you caught Josh Brockner.
Yes, we did.
what about the triplets?
dead end.
we know one of them did it, but we just can't tie it to them individually.
identical blood and identical DNA.
just got to figure out which one of them it belongs to.
antibodies, Eric.
antibodies.
all the girls were born with the same blood.
what they don't know is that every time the body experiences a specific trauma, it builds antibodies to fight it.
so you got different lives, different traumas.
and Beth Selby's blood is going to show presence of anti-RH positive antibodies, which a woman's body produces when she's pregnant.
well, we find that in the blood, she's our killer.
and thus, the antigen antibody test.
I add a specific reagent to the sample, give her a quick spin in the centrifuge, and if it precipitates, then we've got her.
no.
sorry, Eric. There's no evidence of any anti-RH positive antibodies.
eliminates Beth as the killer.
try this.
this reagent may show us something else on the next blood sample.
you know that this is the very last blood sample from the scene.
we test this one, we're out of crime scene samples.
just call it hunch.
if it doesn't pay off, we've got nothing.
I know.
a killer could walk.
okay.
is it clotting?
Yes, it is.
indicates the presence of specific IgG and IgM antibodies.
you know what that shows.
the presence of a killer.
you know, as a CSI,
I spend a lot of time looking at things that to the naked eye seem identical, but aren't.
likes prints and
DNA, tool marks.
it's just what I do... really well.
so? - So, triplets... are no problem.
I have to say, though, you girls were really good.
I mean, Ashley, you lured Dominic in like a pro.
you used your MBA background to spark a little interest.
maybe there was even love. Who knows?
then, Beth, you stepped in and did the one thing that Ashley couldn't and had a child.
but I didn't kill anybody.
I told you that.
Oh, and you know what, Beth? I believe you.
I think that's the one thing you couldn't do.
the blood from the crime scene showed the presence of IgG and IgM.
Meaning?
meaning that person was immunized against an infectious disease.
dengue fever, to be exact, which is contracted in Africa.
and, Cayla...
only you have been there.
I was told to shoot Dominic when I heard the champagne corks pop.
while Beth was at the gym.
which provided you with a really nice little alibi.
excuse me. If I may have your attention, please?
it wasn't glamorous enough, didn't generate enough tax revenue to ensure the city a rich future.
but they don't understand.
those young lives are the future.
the wealthy often find it easier to part with their money than their time.
...counterparts to shame.
so, a toast to you!
Ashley, I thought you were downstairs.
damn it, Cayla.
we both said that trip was a stupid idea.
it wasn't a trip.
I was a student.
then you got one of your little nosebleeds, didn't you?
so?
so, we did all the work, and you messed up.
are you kidding me, Bethie? You lay there.
he told me how disinterested
I seemed all those months before I got pregnant.
okay, okay, okay, ladies, if it's of any comfort, you're all guilty of murder.
what's going to happen to my baby?
he'll be raised by his father.
excuse me?
his father?
he's dead.
how is that possible?
because I can spot differences, and you three can't.
when you've got money, everybody wants a piece of you.
I spent so much time suspecting the people I work with,
I never thought to look next to me.
my whole life people have told me lies.
you know, despite all that's happened,
I still have the only thing that's important,
my son.
well, he's a lucky kid.
and why is that?
because his father is a good man.
cut!
good? -uh, yeah, I'm good.
I'm good. Thanks.
that was hot! Yeah! -Rod! Rod!
what happened? What the hell?
shot's ruined.
who popped the trunk? -Wasn't me.
must've been open before we rolled. Talk to transpo.
Hey, come quick! -What is it?
you got to see this.
what's going on?
Oh, my god.
it's Brody.
somebody call an ambulance!
I'm live on the scene where actor Brody Lassiter was found dead of his latest movie Full Tilt.
the body of movie star Brody Lassiter was discovered while filming a dangerous high-speed car chase this morning...
no information has been released yet on how Lassiter died or even if he was part of the stunt.
no, he wasn't part of the stunt. It's too dangerous.
apparently so.
how'd he end up in there?
people don't just put themselves in trunks. -I have no idea.
why don't you guys do whatever cops do and find out？
cause your stunt crew destroyed my crime scene.
if you're saying we tried to cover something up, extinguishers are protocol.
you were in charge of the car, weren't you?
Yeah, checked everything last night after the dry run.
locked it up before I left. -Apparently not well enough.
look...I'm sorry.
I've just been doing this so long.
it's always been fake.
I keep thinking brody's gonna be okay.
well, he's not going to walk away from this one.
and neither... will his killer.
this is Melissa Black reporting live...
and today he's dead.
body of Brody Lassiter... 2006 the highest-grossing actor in Hollywood...
all right, careful. Careful, let's do this right.
going to be plenty of eyes watching this one.
was Mr. Lassiter working this morning?
well, that's what's so weird.
his call time wasn't till noon.
how about last night? -No.
no, Brody wraps at 6: 00 sharp.
every 15 minutes we go over, costs us 20 grand.
his contract had a lot of rules. -Rules.
his wardrobe had to be organic cotton.
fresh pomegranate juice every morning, no pulp.
let's just say, a lot of people wanted him off the movie.
hold up, hold up, hold up. Where you going with that?
is that for Brody? -Excuse me.
can I help you?
Yeah, I'm Eddie Corbett. I'm in charge of Brody.
gentlemen, continue, please.
thank you, ma'am.
Mr. Corbett, what can I do for you?
his family's on their way down from Pennsylvania and they want a funeral.
and they're going to get a funeral.
not for a few days. I know how these things work.
then you understand that we do have jurisdiction over the body.
you're gonna cut him up now, right?
what am I going to tell his family? They want an open casket.
I'm sure his family wants me to find out who did this, don't they?
this is my fault.
I should've been watching him.
what did you do for brody?
babysit.
Brody's been known to party.
this movie's huge for the studio. They already greenlit two sequels.
guess I failed.
how long did you know him?
grew up together.
I'm sorry for your loss.
look...
it's no secret that Brody could be difficult sometimes.
but he didn't deserve to die like this.
Mr. Corbett, no one does.
Brody Lassiter, I don't believe it. -You're a fan?
I only saw Blitzed three times.
it's that whole bad boy thing. I guess I like it.
any idea what killed him?
well, won't know much until I get this flame-retardant powder off him.
honey, what is in that trunk? Because baby boy is glowing.
what does it look like?
antifreeze is this color, but no one's gonna use that in Miami, and it definitely doesn't glow.
wait a minute.
I got it. It's a broken glow stick.
it's got to be fresh if it's still working.
maybe they used it in the stunt. -I don't think so.
says it's from a nightclub.
there are no tool marks on the trunk and the lock hasn't been tampered with.
so no one broke in. And the stunt guy had the only key.
stunt guy is lying.
someone must've stolen it last night after wrap.
the steering column was intact and you're the only one with the key.
so, why don't you try again？
okay.
I took the car out.
me and Brody went clubbing in it.
so, what happened? You and Brody have drink too much, get in a fight?
no, no way.
Brody was stone-cold sober.
that's the good part about going out with a guy in rehab.
Brody Lassiter was in rehab? -Yeah, inpatient with work privileges. Where've you been?
so, Bbrody snuck out last night. -Yeah.
sweet for me a designated driver who's a movie star.
I could get hammered and get into every club in the city.
why don't you get to the part where Brody ends up in the trunk.
believe me, I have no idea.
he was fine when I dropped him off at white sands.
white sands, that's the, uh, that's the rehab center for the rich and famous?
after he went inside, I was too wasted to drive, so, I thought I'd sleep it off a little bit in the parking lot.
damn, dude, the way you drive, you should be doing your own stunts.
Nah, too many pads and helmets. This is more fun.
Oh, man. I think I'm going to hurl.
see you later, rod.
when I woke up, it was an hour to call time.
so I left.
why didn't you say anything before?
I took a production car.
it wasn't even insured.
I could lose my stunt accreditation.
Oh, I think you can lose a lot more than that.
look, I told you,
I had nothing to do with Brody dying.
we're going to hold you for a little while just to make sure of that.
I don't trust you actors. -I'm a stunt guy.
whatever.
Hi.
Brody didn't die in the car, ryan.
what do you mean?
he has a ligature mark on his neck.
the mark's at an angle, above the laryngeal prominence.
and that's consistent with a hanging.
it was suicide. -No.
look at the laceration on his neck.
he tried to pull the rope off. -That's right.
and you don't typically find marks like these in a true suicide.
only do that if you don't want to die.
okay, so explain to me how you hang a 170-pound guy against his will?
didn't someone hear him screaming? -It's rehab.
everyone's screaming.
you ever seen someone go through detox?
see, that reminds me, I gotta get over there, but thank you, alexx.
I knew you could do it. -Do what, honey?
get me probable cause for a warrant.
you are wasting your time, gentlemen.
white sands...saved brody's life.
he couldn't have been killed here.
trust me. This is a safe place.
well, we looked into the history of this place. It's, um...
it's not that safe. -What do you mean by that?
two people died here, Mr. Ashford.
those were suicides.
we've made changes since then.
define changes, please.
when a patient checks in, we confiscate anything that could be used as a weapon.
please remove your shoes, mr. Lassiter.
I'm also going to need your belt, your cell phone.
do you have any sharp objects on your person? -No.
I don't know if i can do this, man.
I know it doesn't seem like it right now...
it gets easier.
now, you have any problems, you come to me personally... okay?
Thanks.
and look around.
glasses are plastic, not even a butter knife.
I think we're gonna look a little harder than that.
what's this?
that is a search warrant. -Oh, no.
you're not gonna turn this place into a circus.
these people pay a lot of money to protect their confidentiality.
relax. We're only looking into brody lassiter's room.
fine.
you won't find anything. -I guess time will tell.
Yeah, got it. -The noose?
no, where the rope was hung. There's A...
there's a groove in the wood.
so this is definitely where brody died. So much for being the, uh... safest place in miami, you know?
Yeah, well, ashford was right about one thing.
there's nothing in this room that can be used like a noose.
I found something. -Yeah? What's that?
it's a hair. Black, but it's too long to be brody'S.
bet you it's female. -Well, yeah.
he's a big star. Probably had his pick of any of the girls in here.
Hey, natalia. -Yeah?
the walls of the bathroom aren't painted green, are they? -No.
cause there's a mark on this shelf that's green. And it looks like...
looks like somebody had wet paint on their fingers.
there are green pots outside. Did you see those?
Yeah, the ones lining the walkway.
somebody had to have painted them.
Yeah, I painted the pots.
anything I can do to stay away from all those celebutantes.
so it sounds like it's a common practice for the patients to tend the grounds.
it's part of their treatment plan.
doing manual labor's supposed to get you in touch with your inner self, or some zen bs like that.
you're up at white sands under court order.
this pansy judge spun a tale that I'm a violent drunk.
but I'm not like those brats.
I don't belong there. -I would agree.
I think you belong in jail.
what were you doing in brody lassiter's room?
so this third degree is about mr. Hollywood?
I thought you guys found his body on some movie set.
we also found your paint in his room.
these kids get any drug they want smuggled in there.
rumor was he was hiding vodka in his water bottle.
so a couple days ago, I went looking.
look, lieutenant, you can't pin this on me.
I know this game.
I've been in the hot seat before.
then get comfortable.
so I heard that natalia didn't get a hit with codes on the black hair we found in brody's room.
that is true, but that might be of some help.
turns out, it's not really black.
it's dyed. That's pretty great.
it's a lead. -Well, in theory.
right. White sands isn't gonna give us a list of their patients with dyed hair.
medical confidentiality even covers murder.
it's a good thing it doesn't cover gossip. Come with me.
it's a guilty pleasure.
have not read it yet, but holly reese is on the cover.
she just went into rehab.
is that right? I thought she was the one celebrity with a good reputation.
I know. So much for the bubble gum image, right?
and her blonde hair--look at that.
Yeah, used to be blonde. Exactly.
Wow. -All right.
looks like brody's helping her through her addiction.
white sands is known for its privacy, but that photo was taken inside brody's room, wasn't it?
well, how'd the paparazzi get in there? -I don't know.
why don't you go there, and I'm gonna go talk to holly.
that sounds good.
sorry for dragging you out here. It's just...
never know who's taking notes inside.
paparazzi's everywhere.
Yeah, I read the article in telltale.
so I just want to ask you a few questions.
does this mean I'm a suspect?
or just one of those persons of interest?
well, it really just depends on how you explain what you were doing in brody's room.
we have evidence that puts you there.
am I in trouble?
Oh, my god, you're gonna arrest me.
okay, quick, just do it before someone sees me.
no, uh, miss reese, you can turn around.
I'm just here to ask you a few questions.
I just want to know what you were doing in brody's room.
it's hard to have fun in this place without your cell phone, you know?
so, um, we have sex.
beats therapy. -Oh, I feel cured.
how about you?
wasn't serious.
okay, did you see him last night? -No.
I was "hallway monitor" last night.
sucked. -Really?
did you see something, someone, anything unusual?
well, no. I, uh...
truth is, I passed out.
from what? This is rehab.
uh, yeah. Side effect, from being an addict.
sometimes I get blackouts.
when you need an alibi? -No.
no, I cared about brody.
I mean, we started out just hooking up, but then,
I don't know, he got me.
he understood the whole "I want to be normal, but I'm famous" thing.
I'd never kill him.
I think it's a good thing that you can't leave.
I know. This place is like prison.
trust me, it's nothing like prison.
well, we got to figure out where the photographer was if we're gonna figure out who he is, cause maybe he snapped some pictures the night of the murder.
well, from the angle of the shot, they had to have taken it through this window.
Yeah, paparazzi with a telephoto lens.
maybe they took it from one of those rooms.
something's weird.
from that distance, they'd never get that vantage point. The angle is...
it's too steep. -Yeah they would've had to be closer to the room.
or in it.
unbelievable.
boy, I can't even imagine the things this camera's seen.
that's the camera from brody's room? -Yeah.
unfortunately, it's only pointed at the bed.
since the murder happened in the main room, we don't get to see the killing.
but there is one interesting thing.
the bedspread. -Exactly.
it was never in any crime scene photos. -Okay, continue, please.
wait a minute.
there's somebody there.
but his face is never on screen.
wait a minute. Right there.
the ring. -Yes, in its reflection.
let me resolve that image.
is that the head of the clinic? -Not for long.
taking out the trash?
bag on the table and step away from it.
clients aren't the only ones who do chores around here.
we like to set a good example.
you can't touch that. Your warrant only covers brody's room.
the warrant has been amended.
gave up your rights once you compromised your patients, mr. Ashford.
put cameras in those rooms, you took pictures, and you sold them to the tabloids.
so much for privacy.
look, you've got to understand.
white sands does not advertise.
good publicity is how we keep these rooms full.
a little invasion of privacy...and they love the exposure.
looks like we found our noose.
Mr. Ashford, you adjusted that camera angle to cover the murder, didn't you?
no.
I didn't kill brody.
I found him hanging there this morning.
I moved the camera so it didn't catch me moving his body.
lieutenant, suicides are bad for my business. -So is murder.
so if you didn't string him up, who did?
I don't know.
but there are plenty of people who had cause.
Why?
yesterday, brody reached level 6.
confessions.
basically, you make good with your past.
apologize to everyone you've wronged.
our suspect pool just got bigger.
so that means I'm off the hook. -No, not exactly.
you're an accessory to murder.
get ready for level 6.
so who did brody confess to?
all the patients at white sands, they have to share three landlines, and brody had access to one of those phones last night from 7: 00 to 9: 00.
I traced all the calls he made.
almost everyone he confessed to lives out of state.
the locals check out, too, so it's a dead end.
maybe the confession wasn't over.
how we gonna know who he was going to call?
we go back to the clinic.
the administration will just keep stonewalling us.
talk to the patients.
my parents never told-- -At least you still have a mom.
Hey, hey, hey!
no cross-talking.
you can finish that thought tomorrow.
okay, that's it for today, everyone. Let's go.
Hey, guys, listen, uh, before you all take off, I'm eric delko, mdpd.
I'm just looking for a little help with a few questions about brody lassiter.
let's go.
just information, guys.
no one's in any kind of trouble.
I was wondering when someone was going to ask about brody, but I don't think we're legally allowed to talk.
well, what's your name? -Jolene.
it's okay.
it's just the employees here who are bound by confidentiality.
well, I really shouldn't say anything anyway.
Brody was hanged last night.
any help I can get in solving this murder, I appreciate it.
okay, but we only talked, like, four or five times.
all right. Well, what do you think you know?
well, this one time we were partnered up.
sort of role-playing before we hit level 6.
the confessions? -Yeah.
and he confessed something.
Oh, this is really hard for me.
just say it, brody.
let it out.
I killed someone. -What?!
you killed someone?
I'm not sure if it was real, but he did say that.
thank you, jolene.
you know, you're really brave.
Why? For telling you? -No.
for being here.
Tripp, look, I've got a girl here who says that -lassiter confessed to killing somebody. -Any idea who?
she doesn't know that part.
so, look, we've got to go through brody's entire history for unexplained deaths, anything.
I think I know where to start.
Eddie, you told me that you and brody grew up together.
that's right. Raised on the same block.
maybe shared some of the same instincts.
what's that supposed to mean? -Look, eddie -we know brody killed someone. -What?!
you're his best friend. You knew that.
maybe you helped him clean it up.
no way. -Found out you used to have a job in waste management.
that was high school, man.
all right, let's try something a little more recent.
Angie paulson was doing a comedy with brody when she disappeared.
never showed up on the set, never heard from again.
that girl was crazy.
she went all buddhist. Moved to tibet or something.
according to her family, she's still a missing person.
and if you helped brody dispose of angie's body, that ties you in.
look, man, I didn't do anything.
everybody's done something, eddie.
that's the noose delko found in the clinic director's trash?
Yeah. Guess what I found on it?
what? -Mass spec says that it's heroin.
the tabloid said holly reese was admitted for heroin.
she could have relapsed. She did say she blacked out.
Yeah, but the clinic's never going to let us look at her records.
that's true, but we have her hair.
looks like holly hasn't done any heroin recently.
you know what? In fact, she's never done any at all.
what do you mean? -Her hair is crystal-clean.
there's no heroin. There's no drugs. There's nothing.
so she lied about being an addict.
I don't know. Everybody wants out of rehab. Why does she want in?
see what star was arrested at rehab today.
Hey, holly. It's calleigh duquesne.
Hey. Have a seat. -Thank you.
front page of the tabloids and breaking news all in one week.
and that's good? -Oh, all publicity is good publicity.
well, how about this headline? "Holly reese fakes addiction."
what are you talking about?
I mean, I'm here to kick heroin.
Holly, hair records drugs like a timeline.
your hair is completely clean.
look, um,
I'm just here researching for a role.
it's a huge part. I get to un-glam, and that's how all the stars get oscars.
halle, nicole, charlize.
how did you get past the physical screenings?
Mr. Ashford knows my situation.
he helped me get admitted.
Holly, you do realize that he is the person who sold the pictures of you and brody to the tabloids, don't you?
Hey, he got press, I got press. Everyone's happy.
I don't know that everyone's happy.
Brody lassiter's representatives released a statement to the media a couple of days ago saying that the two of you were never together.
that must have hurt.
well, yeah. -And so what?
you went into brody's room last night, got all of your anger out?
no, I didn't.
I was on hall duty, like I told you.
but you also said that you blacked out, and clearly, that's a lie.
I just didn't want to say what I saw.
well, I'm afraid now you have no choice.
fine. It was jerry, that criminal guy.
he went into brody's room last night.
Jerry went into brody's room a lot of nights.
are you trying to tell me that brody lassiter was gay?
look, I don't know for sure, all right?
I mean, he liked girls, too.
I think.
do you remember about what time jerry went into his room?
no. I wasn't looking at my watch.
God, you're not going to tell anyone, are you?
I mean, I finally get a picture in the tabs with an a-lister, and then it turns out that he likes guys.
that news doesn't exactly make me bankable.
well, I guess all publicity is not good publicity.
you said you were in brody's room a few days ago, but we have an eyewitness that puts you there last night.
you and brody were in a relationship, weren't you?
he's dead, so you can stop protecting his reputation.
we found a lot of his personal items in your room.
you two think I'm a fruit.
what were you doing with his stuff? -Selling it.
didn't you see how much justin's half-eaten piece of pizza went for on e-bay?
I saw an opportunity to make a little extra cash.
so, he found you stealing his stuff, and you decided to kill him?
no.
he wasn't even there.
I had nothing to do with his murder.
we found heroin on the murder weapon. -Good for you.
did you pick up a new habit in rehab? -No.
then you won't mind proving that, will you?
Hey. Jerry tested negative for heroin.
I don't think he's our killer.
Yeah, I don't think so, either. -Why not?
because the noose that was used to hang brody was made of dental floss.
dental floss? -Yeah.
how-how is that possible?
has a tensile strength of up to 25 pounds per strand.
you braid it together, it makes it even stronger.
it's even been used to break out of jail.
okay, but how does that rule jerry out?
well, based on the number of strands and the length of the rope, took someone a long time to make it, and jerry's only been in rehab two weeks.
so, who's been at white sands the longest?
you've been a patient here at white sands for almost two months, which means that you would have had ample time to make this.
it was used to hang brody lassiter. -What?
it disappeared from my room last night.
what were you going to use the rope for, jolene?
nothing, really.
come on.
you know I'm allowed to leave white sands anytime I want.
I just don't have the guts to do it.
you were going to kill yourself?
I feel like I...
I might not make it at home.
but you've come so far.
two months sober.
but in rehab, there's always someone to talk to.
there's people watching me.
what am I going to have in kansas city?
my journals?
rehab exercises?
that's not going to go very far.
but what about your family?
they spent all their money sending me here.
what if it doesn't work?
I'm going to let them down again. -No you're not going to let them down.
they want to help you.
how do you know?
a couple of months ago, I got shot.
and I was scared to come back to work.
you were? -Yeah.
I didn't want to ask for anybody's help.
I ended up making...
a few mistakes.
but every day it gets a little better.
and it'll get better for you, too.
your friends and family, they just want to be there for you.
you're gonna be okay, jolene.
I guess I'll have to be.
somebody stole my other option.
Hey. -Hey.
so, uh...so, what's all this?
they're brody's journals. We confiscated them from jerry.
luckily, you got to them before he put 'em on e-bay.
what is this? This looks like his obituary.
it is.
that's not supposed to come out till tomorrow.
I know. This one was written a week ago.
by who? -Well, brody wrote it himself.
it's a rehab exercise.
it's supposed to make you write down everything you've done in your life and the changes you want to make.
does it say that he killed someone in this?
no, but he does make reference to an "accident." -Really?
after the accident,"brody lassiter got into drugs, and decided to move to miami to be an actor.
I think he may have moved to evade charges?
well, we, uh, looked into his history.
he doesn't have any warrants or, uh, wants for him.
Yeah, but an accident's not a crime.
so, how do you find out if something happened to a dead guy?
go to the source.
so, calleigh, I figured out why no one heard him screaming.
subdural hematoma. He hit his head.
well, that would explain why he didn't fight back.
what about any older injury? Anything like that?
not on the body, but inside.
see that? Right there. -Ribcage?
these are multiple healed fractures.
when we break bones, they actually grow back thicker and stronger than before, so they show up brighter on the x-ray.
these are compression fractures. -Meaning?
he was hit with something straight on.
this'll show us what.
whatever it was, it was round.
it was a car accident.
well, if there was a a fatality, it would have been in the news.
so, what exactly are we looking for?
we're looking for fatal car crashes that occurred before brody moved from pennsylvania to miami.
these are all the clips from local williamsport newspapers.
here's one: "Tragic accident."
but the driver was apprehended at scene and arrested.
Yeah. Moving on. -Okay.
Oh, here's one.
Nah, that car was sideswiped.
that wouldn't cause steering wheel impact.
okay. Moving on.
here we go.
local girl killed in grisly crash.
ran the car into a telephone pole, and the driver was killed.
Yeah, brody's x-rays are showing that he was the driver.
okay. Moving on.
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Go back a second.
back... okay.
look at the name of the victim. -Diane corbett.
that's right.
that's the same last name as brody's assistant, eddie corbett.
then maybe brody was there.
maybe he just moved diane's body into the driver's seat after the car accident and took off.
I think we just found our crash.
we found heroin in your apartment, eddie.
personal use.
to take the edge off. What are you gonna do, arrest me for it?
no, I'm going to arrest you for murder.
what? -We found heroin residue on brody's noose.
I'm guessing it's a match to yours.
Brody made a big deal about me moving out here.
said he didn't know who to trust.
needed his best friend around.
it was all guilt. -Guilty about diane. Right?
Yeah.
she was my big sister. -And she died in that car accident, didn't she?
I didn't even know brody was in the car.
I mean, he's supposed to be my best boy and he doesn't even tell me that he was the one driving?
trying to tell you, eddie.
last night, he...
he called me from the club. He told me to meet him at white sands.
I- I thought he relapsed or something.
because he wanted to confess to you.
like it was okay now because he said it out loud.
I'm so sorry, bro. I wanted to tell you, but...
then why didn't you?
I was scared. -You killed my sister.
you killed her!
he wasn't breathing.
I didn't mean for that to happen.
so you decided to make it look like suicide.
that was the idea.
and I searched in a bunch of rooms, you know, for anything that could've made it seem like brody could've done it himself.
then I found that rope.
Brody was still alive.
Yeah. I freaked. I ran.
just like he did ten years ago. -No, no, no, no, it was different.
Yes, it was different, eddie.
the difference is you got caught.
the paparazzi is loving this.
best friends both turn out to be killers.
this brings the brody lassiter murder investigation to a close.
best friend and longtime assistant eddie corbett has just been arrested.
and in other celebrity news, holly reese's latest project has been greenlit.
it will focus on one brave young woman's struggle with addiction.
and speaking of addiction, pop singer elvina has reportedly checked herself into rehab.
I guess it's true, everybody has a secret.
some of us more than one.
help! Please, help me!
please help me!
help! Please, help me!
the city of Miami has been gripped with a local news story, first reported here on WETX yesterday afternoon.
the victim: Innocent; the crime: Shocking.
and all of it caught on tape.
local college student Sherry Williamson was brutally carjacked early yesterday morning.
a nearby security camera, the only witness.
with us, we have special correspondent Ryan Wolfe, former csi with the Miami-Dade crime lab.
welcome, Ryan.
thank you, Heather.
it's nice to be here again.
now, the unnamed suspect is still at large.
what can your forensic background tell us about the scene of the crime?
okay, uh, well, you see, the average person would look at the center of the action, but as a csi, I'm trained to look from the outside, and work inward.
now, if we focus here on the attacker...
we're never going to see his face.
so, we have to, uh, analyze the environment around him.
okay, right here.
if we isolate this image, and then we magnify it, and then we enhance it...
you'll see the attacker's identity clear as day.
if anyone has information regarding this man's whereabouts, please call the station's hotline at 555-0111.
it's quite a crowd, Frank.
Yeah, word spread fast.
everybody clamoring to sneak a peek at public enemy #1.
carjacker.
Yeah.
whose face Ryan plastered all over television about an hour ago.
did we get a name?
no.
no id, and nobody's talking.
city on the hunt.
looks like vigilantes took it upon themselves to be the guy's judge and jury.
judge, jury and executioner.
is it just me, or have people gotten a little too casual about seeing a dead body?
easier when decomp's at a distance.
believe me.
we've got at least a dozens footprints here.
if an angry mob got to him, that would explain our boy's injuries.
ligature mark on his ankle, possibly held in restraint.
baby boy didn't go down quietly.
bruising, lacerations.
fingernails on both hands are torn.
wait a minute.
is that something under the nail bed?
it's like a wood splinter.
it's going to be impossible to process this scene.
people have contaminated it.
someone also contaminated the body.
smell's unmistakable.
it's urine.
it's not just enough to kill somebody.
you've got to make a statement.
media blew this carjacking way out of proportion.
maybe Ryan fueled the fire.
he didn't just fuel the fire.
he lit the match.
miss Williamson...
miss Williamson, I know this is difficult, but can you tell me if that's the man that hurt you?
Yes, that's him.
what happened?
I just left the bank and was going to my car.
he came out of nowhere.
Hey, how you doing?
Hey. - Hey!
help, please!
help me!
did he have a weapon?
no.
guess he really didn't need one.
now he's dead.
I can't help but feel responsible.
why do you say that?
all the craziness this caused.
Yes, I wanted justice, but...not like that.
I understand.
stand by.
15 minutes to air.
all remaining talent to the set, please.
cameras to your places...
Hey. - Hey.
how's it going?
thanks for coming down.
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.
you look different.
must be the eyeliner.
I wear makeup now.
you must think it's pretty, uh, pretty silly.
no, that wasn't the adjective I was looking for.
well, I got to earn a living.
so, congratulations.
I heard you found the carjacker.
is that why you called me down here?
to ease your conscience?
you know, you may have gotten a man killed today.
I didn't really think it would go that far.
well, that seems to be a pattern with you.
okay, so this about the, uh, it's about the gambling...?
it's about everything, Ryan.
you assaulted a police officer.
you leaked information to Erica Sikes.
okay, well, all that is done now.
not doing it anymore.
are you not doing it in the way that you burned the counterfeit money and promised you would never bet again?
doesn't this job ever get to you?
I needed an outlet.
I wasn't hurting anyone.
Really?
you were being blackmailed by a suspect who you owed money to.
and I paid him that money so that he wouldn't have any power over the investigation that I was a part of.
you gambled on the clock so that you could pay him back.
and I did it in a card club.
and I wasn't breaking any laws.
you broke all the rules.
and because you have, every case you have ever worked on is being called into question, so if you say that you weren't hurting anyone, think about all of the people left behind to pick up the pieces for you.
speaking of which, I'm needed in DNA.
I have to go.
wait . wait.
just wait a second.
after my segment ran, the station received a lot of phone calls - including about a dozen death threats-- to the carjacker.
these are the, uh, names and numbers.
hopefully, one of them is your guy.
are you familiar with the South Pointe area, Mr. Hewitt?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's where they found that guy.
the carjacker, right?
the carjacker you threatened.
and we found your DNA on his clothes.
it was nice work, and quick.
I'm a fan of law enforcement, you know?
Yes. But you don't believe in the law, do you?
I do.
but sometimes you-you got to take things into your own hands.
I saw the carjacker on the beach in the morning.
recognized him from the news.
did to him what he did to that poor girl.
with a little interest.
come on.
step outside the badge a second.
you got to admit.
streets are much safer without this guy on them.
that's not up to you.
sir, were you brought in for questioning?
are you a suspect?
I'm not a suspect. I did it.
I killed the carjacker.
is there anything else you'd like to say?
you bet. People of Miami, we can take back our city.
make it safe for our families.
so you admit it? You are a vigilante?
you can call me whatever you want.
I'm just a concerned citizen.
let's take back our city!
take it back!
excuse me, officer?
is that him?
the guy who killed my brother?
your brother?
I'm sorry, but I'm not at liberty to discuss an open case.
came as soon as I heard.
I still can't believe it.
what's your brother's name?
I just saw his picture on the news.
think you would feel comfortable identifying his body for us?
sure. Whatever you need.
okay.
you heard it live.
Derek Hewitt, a mechanic from homestead, has confessed to the murder of a still unnamed suspect who was caught on video assaulting young Sherry Williamson in broad daylight yesterday.
Hewitt, a self-described vigilante, urged others to "take back the city" by any means necessary.
H Natalia called.
she spoke to the victim's brother.
and we got a positive id on him.
it's Jason Billings.
did you get a cause of death?
Yes. It's a jefferson fracture.
vertical force to cause a broken neck.
check out these photos Alex sent over.
she documented all the injuries he sustained.
several to his rib cage were postmortem.
and then there's this.
that looks like a shark bite.
Yeah, also postmortem.
so if jason was already dead when he was bitten, that means he died out on the water and then somehow made it back to shore.
before he was id'd on the news.
Yeah, before Ryan broadcast his face.
so our vigilante didn't kill the carjacker.
he just wanted the credit.
so if he didn't kill him, who did?
well, I mean...Wednesday.
Yeah.
I don't know. I mean, in all honesty,
I've been...
Bye.
Hey.
great to see that smile.
it's nothing.
who was that? Jake?
um, yeah, i told him that if people would stop killing each other, we could have a proper meal.
is that info on the carjacker?
Yeah.
guy's name is Jason Billings.
born into money.
he had some pretty expensive hobbies.
like what?
like racing anything he can get his hands on.
horses, cars, boats.
why would a guy with that much money to burn need to steal a car?
had to be out of desperation.
we need to find out where Jason docked his boat.
Miami-Pade pd.
is this Jason Billings' boat?
Yes, it is.
is he in some kind of trouble?
not anymore.
he's dead.
Oh, my god.
how do you know him?
I just...I work for him.
I keep his boat clean and running.
did you clean it today?
no, no, I just, I just got started.
check out the kill switch.
the strap's torn.
didn't our victim have ligature marks on his ankle?
what, do you think somebody pushed Jason out of his boat?
Yeah, and it means Jason took the kill switch with him.
if it disengages, the motor shuts off.
it means the killer had to get it back to ride the boat back to shore.
Yes, leaving Jason to die.
where were you this morning?
I was in the Keys.
party went late. I slept in.
I got, like, 30 people who can vouch for me.
Really?
well, you're gonna need more than 30 hungover college kids.
like what?
like DNA, prints.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
what am I supposed to do now?
why don't you take the rest of the day off?
we'll look after the boat.
okay?
this is a sweet ride.
it's a custom-built twin-engine donzi.
1, 400-horsepower.
this thing's so fast you can barely see it on the radar.
this is such a guy thing.
I mean, there's really only one reason to buy a boat like this.
try to look cool.
Oh, there's another reason.
how about drug smuggling?
see these markings on the hull here?
cement.
it's used to affix what's called a blister.
okay, I've heard of those.
that's what they hide the drugs inside to avoid detection.
blisters are usually made of fiberglass and painted the same color as the boat.
easy to pry off in case the coast guard spots them.
this blister's long gone, though.
but the cement left a mark.
looks like there's something in it.
looks like sand.
there's no reason to run a $500, 000 boat aground on purpose.
Nope, not unless you're in a real hurry to offload a drug shipment.
Oh, great.
now we got to search hundreds of miles of Florida coastline.
I'm all up for a treasure hunt and everything, but this is a lot of ground to cover.
and that's why I brought along our new toy, the profiler.
it's electromagnetic, so it picks up more than a metal detector.
Yeah, but so far all we've got is an ipod, four beer bottles, and a beach towel, but no fiberglass blister with the drugs.
so we keep looking until we find the blister.
is that who I think it is?
Yeah, Ryan Wolfe with on-the-spot coverage.
God, he just keeps anticipating our every move.
want me to go talk to him?
no, let's keep working.
I don't have my tripod, Wolfe.
how do I get a decent close-up of them from here?
you're not shooting them, Eddie.
you're shooting me.
what's the matter?
afraid your csi colleagues will steal the spotlight?
I'm respecting their work.
come on, man.
a little closer.
come on. Get closer.
there's no crime scene tape.
Hey, man, just 'cause you heard about this on the police scanner doesn't mean you get to interfere with a murder investigation.
you understand that?
you got that?
I'm going to do my opener from here, all right?
Yeah, looks good, looks good.
I just want it a little wider.
get it off!
Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, relax!
get it off me!
I can't. I can't get it off or you're gonna bleed to death. all right?
hold on.
call for help!
call emergency!
get rescue out here now!
Oh, get it off!
hold on, man, hold on. All right?
he lost a lot of blood.
it's going to be close.
you know, us being here and us following you around, that's not my idea.
the assignment editors wanted me to follow up on a story.
just in case you were wondering.
no, I, I, I wasn't.
it's just that, um...
it's just that I'm on somebody else's payroll now, and it's weird.
I know.
I mean, I-I've been there.
when I worked for the feds, it was easy to lose sight of whose side I was on.
what do you think I should do?
short term: Get away from the cameras;
and long term: You're just going to have to decide what your own priorities are.
you sure you're okay?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Natalia, that trap was put there to protect something.
will you bring your camera?
Yeah.
thing looks like something out of Vietnam.
or drug runners trying to protect their stash.
what is it?
looks like when that trap was triggered, it disturbed a lot of the sand around here.
it's the blister.
can you help me lift this?
Yeah.
well, there's our buried treasure.
it's wrapped in banana leaves to protect from moisture.
it's a common practice in Cuba.
Jason Billings was in deep.
this is a big stash.
if you bury something this well, you don't draw attention to it by setting a trap.
you do if you intend to kill the person that's following you.
by looking into your brother's past, Mr. Billings, it shined a light on your own.
what do you mean?
it turns out the boat is registered to you.
Yeah, the boat's in my name, but I gave it to Jason.
so what?
Jason may have been killed on the boat.
wait, I thought the vigilante guy killed him on the beach.
we have new information, don't we?
like that the boat was being used for drug running.
I...
I thought he was into something.
but it was his business.
I didn't ask.
we believe that Jason was offloading drugs.
we want to know for who.
do you have any idea who he hung out with?
there was this one guy.
he had those eyes, you know, like he wasn't afraid of anything.
that's going to change.
can I help you?
I think you can, Tony.
I know a lot of people.
I'm, uh, not so good with names, though.
Jason used his boat to smuggle drugs for you and now he's dead.
wow, that's...
that's creative, man.
I understand you have a connection with the Sovantes Cartel of Cuba.
connection to a drug cartel, now...
now you're just flat-out insulting me.
listen, I have three homes.
okay, a yacht, solid rep.
life is good, man. Why would I kill anyone?
maybe to keep it that way.
well, when you have proof...
then we'll talk.
looking forward to it.
so what have we got?
well, my friend, you dug up 20 kilos of pure heroin, street value: $1. 4 million.
do you have any idea who was handling the banana leaves?
sand destroyed most of the prints, but I found one on the underside that was willing to cooperate.
it belongs to the left index finger of this guy.
Yeah, h got a reference sample from him earlier, including that ten card.
doesn't he work on Jason Billings's boat?
I guess.
when he's not smuggling heroin from Cuba.
I'm not a drug runner, sir. I promise you.
I'm not interested in getting bounced out of Dade university.
see, we found your fingerprint though, cole, on ten kilos of pure heroin.
explain that to me.
whenever Jason offered to take me for a ride, it was usually for a mile for two.
one day he says," how about Cuba? "
I was all over it.
that far.
that fast.
it was awesome.
what happened when you got there?
it was like an indy pit stop.
some guys directed us in to refuel.
and Jason asked me to help him.
Hey, don't just stand there.
give me a hand with this, will you, buddy?
what is it?
come on. What does it look like?
no, I can't, man.
I shouldn't.
well, you don't, you're not coming back with me.
you helped him load the boat?
I didn't have a choice.
he had this look on his face I'd never seen before.
did you help him bury the product when you got back?
no, my involvement ended when we docked here.
he told me to keep my mouth shut, and I did.
that's it.
well, I guess we're going to find out, huh, Cole?
hmm, that is gruesome.
so you found something in the trap?
Yeah, epithelia, but they're not from our unfortunate cameraman.
it matches the reference sample of Cole Telford.
the college kid.
I found skin in this hinge right here.
he must've gotten pinched trying to put this contraption together.
he lied his way out of the prints, but I think he's going to have a tough time with this one.
so you're a mechanical engineering major?
Yeah, got one semester to go.
I wouldn't be in such a hurry.
what's that?
Oh, come off it, Mr. Telford.
your DNA already broke the news.
you set the trap, and I'm willing to bet you built it.
Yeah. It was spring-loaded for 125 pounds of pressure.
Jason loved the idea.
Oh, get it off! oh, get it off!
Jason was paranoid.
he thought Decker was tracking us, that he'd do anything to get his heroin back.
the trap was to send him a message.
well, you're going to have a lot of time to work on your communication skills.
is he going to be okay?
the guy in the hospital?
he's recovering.
well, I guess I got lucky.
Yeah, real lucky.
now you got 20 years to figure out how to build your next trap.
good afternoon, Mr. Wolfe.
good afternoon.
who are you here to see?
Yeah, bring him in.
all right, listen, I've got to go.
Yeah.
Bye.
you're late, pal.
what, did you get, uh, stuck in the makeup chair?
that's very funny.
Where's your visitor's pass?
are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.
all right, so you're pissed at me now, too?
no, Wolfe, I got my own problems.
now put your visitor's pass on before I get my ass thrown out of here, all right?
now, what have you got for me?
this is so strange.
Yeah.
this is the footage you dissected from your TV show?
you know, uh, as a csi, I like to work from the outside inward.
you have an uncanny gift for impersonations.
I actually should've practiced what I preached.
take a look at the part where Jason gets in the front seat.
there.
you see that?
no, see what?
all right, roll it back.
go back to where you started.
at 30 frames per second, the surveillance cameras record too slow to pick it up.
right there on the roof.
Yeah, some kind of spark. And you were able to see that?
not until I looked between the frames.
that's a good eye, Wolfe.
how many times have you watched this?
after the, uh, citywide manhunt, I started...A few.
now, that spark-- I think it's a ricochet.
somebody fired a bullet.
Yeah, well, Sherry Williamson didn't mention anything about gunfire to Horatio when she spoke to him.
she's been in on this the whole time.
not bad, huh?
I still got it.
Yeah, it's, uh...
it's just too bad you can't do anything with it because I'm going to be the one taking it to the judge.
good work.
nice shirt.
the entire city knows your name.
you got citizens who wanted to kill the man who assaulted you, and yet...
you forgot to tell us that someone took a shot at him.
what? What are you talking about?
come on.
I know you're covering for someone.
you're on the hook right now for conspiracy to commit murder.
don't take the fall.
give me the shooter.
it was Jason's brother.
Jason's brother, Paul?
Yes.
he came to me.
asked for help.
why you?
paul and I are seeing each other on and off.
the money he offered me, it would've set me up for a long time.
so, for a price, you were supposed to lure Jason to your car?
he grabbed coffee at the same place every morning, early.
so I pretended to have car trouble.
excuse me, sir.
could you help me?
my car won't start.
Yeah. Sure, where are you parked?
it's just right here.
I got him there.
paul said he'd do the rest.
help! Please, help me!
so Paul fired outside the security camera's range.
the plan was botched.
paul missed.
and then I end up on the news, damsel in distress.
damsel in distress, huh?
well, I'm afraid this isn't going to have a storybook ending, Ms. Williamson.
I hope your payday was worth it.
that's enough.
we've been down this dead-end road already.
you're in just as deep as your little brother.
running out of ways to phrase this, guys.
it was his mess, not mine.
why did you take a shot at him in broad daylight?
talked to Sherry?
you should've paid her more.
she belted it out like an opera singer.
Jason was in deep with Decker.
his shipment numbers from Cuba weren't adding up.
you work for Decker, too?
he told me to take care of it.
Yeah.
by killing Jason.
or he'd kill us both.
I couldn't do it.
so I fired a shot off the top of the car.
Jason took you out on his boat.
what was the purpose of that?
he was asking me for help.
someone tried to kill me this morning.
I think Tony's sent one of his goons after me.
return the kilos you took from him.
it'll all go away.
I promise.
it's too late.
W-what are you looking for?
you still carry that glock with you?
no, and I wouldn't give it to you if I did.
you're one of Tony's goons, Paulie?
no, it wasn't like that.
go ahead. Finish it, Paulie.
finish it.
finish it, Paulie.
he never surfaced.
I recovered the boat's kill switch, rode back to shore.
worked out well for you, didn't it?
I never wanted him to drown.
I just wanted him to give the drugs back to Tony.
I loved my brother.
get him out of here.
cause of death was a broken neck.
guy's spinning us a yarn.
or maybe he's telling the truth, and somebody else finished him off.
Jimmy, push it!
get these guys off my ass!
get inside. Get inside.
this is the United States coast guard and Miami-Dade police department.
prepare to be boarded.
everyone on board your vessel must immediately come topside.
did you have an accident on your boat?
it happens, you know?
day on the water.
it gets slippery.
it certainly was for Jason Billings.
he was never on my yacht, man.
we found his blood on your deck, and his cause of death was a broken neck.
Jason, uh...
he drove the fastest boat in miami, and when his shipments started coming in short, he would lie to me.
blame my Cuban suppliers.
so you followed him.
I had no choice.
I knew his brother wasn't going to finish the job.
he left him out in the water.
Hey, hey, hey.
give me your hand.
where are my missing kilos?
I don't know what you're talking about.
you don't tell me where it is, you're going right back in.
you understand me?
you won't kill me, man.
I'm the only way you'll get any of it back.
you're right.
you're right.
I cut my losses, man.
kid didn't want to save his own life, I wasn't about to save it for him.
you're quite a humanitarian, aren't you?
take him.
here to comment on our latest breaking news story, our resident crime expert, former csi, Ryan Wolfe.
Hi, Heather.
a woman in Pensacola drowned her two young children this afternoon before taking her own life.
is this postpartum...
what?
is this postpartum pushed to the extreme, or is there some societal influence at work?
no, no, that's just horrible is what it is.
you know, to be honest,
I don't think it's really our right to speculate on a mother who drowned her children.
but if you had to.
but I don't have to.
and I don't want to.
I'm sorry, I...
I'm sorry, Heather.
look, my time spent here has been, uh...it's been really fascinating.
it's been great.
but there's someplace else I think I got to be.
there are men and women who put themselves in harm's way every day.
it's their lives for ours.
and for them, it's not something that they do.
it's something that...that, you know, they are.
now, I'm not going to try to make myself sound so honorable, but I took an oath.
I took an oath to protect people in Miami, and, uh...
I was born to be a cop.
and, um...
I think I lost that along the way.
so...
Hey, H.
you helped us, Mr. Wolfe.
Yeah, it was the least I could do.
but you consorted with a known felon, and that's not going to go away any time soon.
you understand that?
I don't expect it to.
everything you've done in the past, everything you do today will come under close scrutiny.
I may not get my job back.
but every case that gets reopened, I'm going to answer to.
I'm not going to abandon this team.
and we, Mr. Wolfe, are not going to abandon you.
I can't hear you; wait.
back off, you jerk!
go around to the stage door and I'll let you in.
Nick Russo from Staten Island.
must be 200, 300 bucks here.
robbery's out.
monroe: Then let's find out what it was.
minimal blood spatter.
maybe he was shot outside the limo?
body doesn't look like it was moved here.
wait.
he must've fallen on the button when he was shot.
lowered the divider.
this much spatter...
could be some on the shooter.
somebody doesn't like Harry Belafonte.
man: No passes, no access.
will this do?
Hey, sorry.
woman: Because I'm the manager, that's why.
just do it.
look, I already told the officer everything I know, which is nothing.
ma'am, we need some information on your driver.
not my driver.
he worked for another company.
top Fleet Limousines, I think.
was he your regular driver?
no, none of us had ever seen him before.
how long a break between the main set and the encore?
all told, eight, maybe ten minutes.
Hey, Kid, can you sign these?
look, I'm sorry, but I have to...
Hey, hey, hey...
no, no, no, it's okay, he knows me.
it's okay, don't touch me, man.
Hey, come here. All right? it's okay!
I'm okay; Hey, Kid, can I talk to you?
not now, man, I'm busy.
no, no, no, I've got to tell you something in private.
dude, chill out; I said I'm busy right now.
all right, man, let's go, come on.
they copied your song, man.
guard: Get outta here.
is y'all the cops?
crime scene.
Yeah, someone did shoot our limo driver.
sucks to be him.
I gotta wait for another ride back to my hotel.
how long's that gonna take?
just another couple minutes, Kid, I swear.
Hey, can you sign this?
Hey, hey.
Yes, I can.
check out this CD.
it's gonna be huge.
is that right? Mm-hmm.
you can find me through my website.
you won't be sorry.
no, I guess I won't.
woman: Hey, Kid, there you are.
you gonna be in town for a few days?
three more shows, you should come check one out.
we have a report of a 1032 auto larceny in front of...
dispatch #2: All units, 10-10.
shots fired, 2344 Lexington Avenue.
possible officer involved, apartment 12 Charlie.
repeat: Possible officer involved.
Stella's boyfriend, Frankie.
he's dead.
I got a pulse.
call EMS.
Where's Frankie?
what happened?
it was awful.
I remember some things, and there's other things
I just can't... I can't remember.
it's okay, whatever you can't remember, the evidence will fill in the gaps.
look, we're gonna have to do an entire work-up on you.
rape kit... we found you unconscious.
need to know exactly what happened.
you're not a CSI on this one, Stella, you're a victim.
so a forensic nurse is going to process you, then Flack will talk to you a bit.
I'm gonna go back to your apartment, do you have any objection to me looking around?
no, no.
Mac's with Stella right now.
: I just... I can't believe it.
how does something like that happen?
I mean, I know how it happens, but...
should we go visit her?
no, Mac said he'd let us know.
wants us to stick to the limo case right now.
business as usual.
you all right?
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
so where a we so far?
I'm thinking robbery's not a motive.
money was intact, no signs of struggle.
and the Beretta's registered.
and to who? Nick Russo.
the limo driver.
killed by his own gun. Prints?
negative.
did we match the bullet?
waiting for ballistics, but dollars to donuts it's a match.
okay, the angle of the shot...
the blood spatter put the killer in the front seat.
and the phone number that was trapped in the door was our vic's.
there was also evidence of sexual activity occurring shortly antemortem.
now, we got a guy that was killed with his own gun soon after having sex.
monroe: Right after giving his phone number to somebody.
the manager said he was a player.
female killer?
that's Sid's thought also.
let's do a timeline.
okay, we have a 15-minute window.
Russo was inside the building five minutes before the break, which was five minutes long.
a crew member saw him, nobody else did.
then he goes back to his car, discovered a few minutes into the encore.
so, our window is 10: 30 to 10: 45.
plenty of time to die.
let's see if our mystery woman left more with our vic than a happy memory.
two aspirin, extra strength.
Stella, this is Nurse Linda McCovey.
she's here to process you.
Hi.
I'll be gentle.
just be thorough.
okay.
from the looks of it, our vic's suit hasn't seen the cleaners in a while.
now, what's up with that?
our limo driver,
Nicky Russo, is a cat person?
he couldn't be.
monroe: But maybe our killer is.
MESSER: Well, it's not domestic.
let's run it against foreign animals.
it's a kinkajou.
who owns this kind of animal?
it's a celebrity thing.
you get a cute little pet, you drag it around town with you.
it's like a playmate.
not the kind of playmate I could see Kid Rock being into or anyone in his band.
I'm just saying.
HAMMERBACK: Stella's boyfriend, huh?
HAWKES: Yeah.
how is she doing?
well, Mac says she's shaken up.
we still don't know what happened over there.
well, I can tell you what happened over here.
okay.
the first two shots were nonlethal
here and here.
I suspect this was the third shot.
kill shot, right in the heart.
I'm going to need these slugs, Sid.
I have to compare them against the weapon Mac found at the scene.
Hawkes, I got the results back on Stella's work-up.
Mm-hmm. Negative on the sex assault kit.
thank God for that.
GSR results: Stella's right hand tested positive for gunshot residue.
well, I've just compared the slugs from Frankie to the weapon you found at the scene.
they match, Mac.
it's confirmed Stella is the shooter.
now we have to find out everything that happened before she pulled the trigger.
FLACK: Mac wanted me to get some info from you, off the cuff, just so that we can make sense of what happened.
do you feel like chatting?
sure.
well, let me tell you what I know.
C. O.D. on Frankie was a fatal gunshot to the heart.
God... like I said, I only remember bits and pieces.
all right, well, we'll just start with what you remember.
bad day, huh?
Frankie was following me.
Frankie. Why haven't you returned my calls?
I saw your sick little website, Frankie.
what? You think that was funny?
you think it would turn me on?
Oh, my God.
so I broke up with Frankie right then and there, told him I never wanted to see him again.
FLACK: And where did you go after that?
BONASERA: I finished some errands, and then I went home.
Hello?
somebody there?
get the hell out of my apartment.
did you hear me, Frankie?
get the hell out of my apartment.
what are you doing?
I'm setting the table.
you weren't armed?
I...
I had my piece in my handbag.
I didn't think Frankie was a threat, you know?
I thought he broke in to get back together.
did Frankie have a key to your apartment?
no. No, he had never even been to my place.
it's one of my rules: no men in my place.
just in case things go bad,
I always have a safe place to go home to.
so you have no idea how he got in, huh?
maybe-maybe he kicked in the door.
when you got back to your apartment, you used your house key to get in, right?
Yeah.
then the door wasn't kicked down.
Frankie didn't kick in your door, Stella.
I did.
but Frankie got in your apartment somehow.
I'll have Mac check the door area.
will you get me the keys of Stella and Frankie Mala and run this, please?
Mm-hmm. Thanks.
you heard me-- kinkajou.
we found one of those hairs on the dead driver's coat.
any one of your clients happen to own one of those things?
Yes, Nancy Sheraton.
Aw, g-get it off me, get off me!
she was taken to the airport yesterday afternoon.
Nick Russo was her driver?
no, she was driven by another one of our chauffeurs.
in that car?
no, each driver is assigned to his own vehicle.
secondary transfer?
got on the first driver, and then passed it to Russo.
was Russo a new driver for the band? That's right.
what happened to the band's previous driver?
I had to let him go, last night, as a matter of fact.
unsuitable for the work.
he was picking up groupies in the car.
he was very unhappy about it.
Oh, yeah.
and what was his name? Blake Mathers.
10: 00 to 11: 00 last night-- your whereabouts.
those two concepts in one answer, please, Mr. Mathers.
like I said, I was at the show.
no one saw you, though.
we checked your story.
you didn't have a pass.
yet you ended up backstage after the show.
which is when we saw you talking to Kid Rock.
he didn't look too happy to see you.
I got to tell you something, in private.
dude, chill out; I said I'm busy right now.
wait... Let's go, come on.
he's got a lot on his mind after a show, okay?
me and Kid, we're friends, man.
we're all about the music.
and his music, special.
you were fired, Blake, for taking people in the limo back to the hotel, trading on your relationship.
that piss you off, no?
course. I didn't do anything wrong, and they fired me.
so what were you doing at the show, Blake?
wanted my job back.
I was going to talk to Kid.
MESSER: Yeah, but then you ended up in the back alley, right, talking to Russo?
what, you think it was his fault that you got fired?
I was never in that alley. Hair...
from the kinka-poodle, or what is it?
got on you, and it transferred to Russo, right?
you know what "transferred" means, Blake?
he was nowhere near the animal-- it was in another car.
the one that you drove, it transferred from you to him.
I didn't do anything... Come on! Enough of the dumb-ass, okay, Blake?
we're wasting our time.
Blake... sit tight for a while, all right?
reconsider your answer.
Montana, hey, what's up?
Hey! We got this guy!
he's about to fold.
Hey, hey, ease up, ease up.
you know what, Danny-- maybe you should just handle this case by yourself, okay?
Mac's handling Stella's situation, all right?
if he needs us, he'll let us know, but until then...
I just wish there was something we could do to help.
you know what Stella would say?
what we could do to help the most is close this Russo case, all right?
all right, thanks.
Frankie was an artist, right?
sculptor.
traces of polymer clay were found in the keyhole.
he made a mold of your key.
lab also found microscopic particles of metal inside the guts of the doorknob.
he used liquid metal to make a cast.
that's how he got in.
son of a bitch probably took the key right off of my key ring.
let's go back to Frankie being in your apartment for a sec.
how come you didn't call us?
all right, that's it.
I'm making a phone call.
God!
you're not going anywhere!
don't you get violent with me!
BONASERA: Do not tell me what to do!
Frankie: You're not going anywhere... until we talk.
stop it!
Ow!
I found the statue that I made for you...
out by the trash chute.
I put it back where it belongs.
monroe: The fatal bullet came from that Beretta.
there are no prints on the gun, so it's not a big help.
what's with the CD?
I thought we were liking Mathers.
the hair puts him with Russo, and he was around during the timeline.
I know, but I'm thinking, why would he shoot this guy?
doesn't get him his job back.
so I figured I'd move on to the next piece of evidence.
which is the CD.
which is where I am right now.
all right, let's see.
clean this up.
I thought the label said Harry Belafonte.
guess they disguise what's on the disk to prevent piracy.
this is a master recording from the record label.
encoded with serial numbers so if it's copied, the copies can be traced.
copied?
who has access to this CD?
kid Rock. Or the management.
maybe Blake Mathers-- he said he was close with Kid.
but why would he break the CD?
maybe Mathers discovered that Russo had the CD to prerelease it, and he broke it to get on the Kid's good side.
what, are you nuts? Do you have any idea what copying that does to the band's sales?
give me that!
come on, man, give it to me!
huh? See?
well, if that's what he was trying to do, he missed the boat.
it's already online.
I think I can figure out who uploaded it.
our victim.
GSR come back on Mathers?
nothing on his clothes last night.
so you said that the band or the management would've had access to that CD.
there was fresh cigar smoke in that limo.
kid Rock smokes cigars.
you think he's involved in this?
they found the body right after the encore began.
kid Rock stood to lose millions.
there's five minutes in that break.
enough time to get out to the alley.
I'll call Mac.
he wanted to know if this came back to the band.
TAYLOR: Excuse me.
how old are you?
I'm 19.
I'm 16.
you can go.
whoa. I swear to God, I didn't...
monroe: Yeah, heard it all before.
you know nothing about Nick Russo's death?
not a thing.
but you were in the limo just before the encore.
maybe.
doesn't mean I shot him.
why would I do that?
Nick Russo released a song from your new CD onto the Internet.
I know that. I told him to do that.
I gave him the CD last night.
you get that done?
it's on the Internet?
Yeah. Yeah.
nice work.
it's like a sales tool.
give them a little preview, they'll eat the rest of that record up, you watch.
why didn't you say anything before?
in front of my management?
you ever hear of something called breach of contract?
is that the jacket you were wearing in the show last night?
that's it.
mind if I take a look at it?
maybe you didn't want that song released.
realized it could track back to the coded serial numbers.
you found out, it was too late.
well, at least I got it done, huh?
Yeah, well I did do it.
idiot. Yeah? Idiot? Huh?
who's the idiot now, huh? Are you crazy?
you want to tell me what that is?
some kid got excited, jumped up on stage.
must've got banged up in the crowd.
you think that's from me shooting the driver?
like, if I did, I wouldn't get rid of that?
just how stupid do you think I am?
you mind if I take this?
go ahead.
look, are we square business here, Detective?
you can take that jacket, you can listen to that CD, whatever floats your boat.
but I didn't shoot that driver, and I don't know who did.
you know how many guilty people sing that same song?
Yeah, that's me.
check out this CD.
it's gonna be huge.
you can find me through my website.
you won't be sorry.
we're not here about the CDs, Felicia, okay?
we found a piece of your cover art in the limousine at the Kid Rock concert.
a lot of people buy my CDs.
we're going to need your prints.
what for? Because there were some prints in the limo we can't identify, including some on the victim's belt.
if you weren't there, we can eliminate you as a possible suspect.
look, okay, I was there.
I talked to the driver.
I wanted a pass.
and what about the phone number?
I was working him a bit.
so, uh, this is a 212 area code.
then I'll definitely call you.
how about that pass?
did you get the pass?
Yeah, I did.
still have it?
thank you.
I'm gonna get that back, right?
it's yours, isn't it?
Yeah, so why don't we all go downtown?
shall we? Come on. Monroe.
Yeah. Thanks.
Danny, Kid Rock's jacket tested negative for Nick Russo's blood.
the prints on the pass come back to Felicia and the driver.
there's nothing to say that her story isn't true.
so we're back to square one.
you could say that.
Danny, everybody backstage at the concert was wearing one of these passes around their neck from one of those beaded chains.
Felicia's pass doesn't have a chain.
MESSER: And the marks could've been made by yanking the pass off the victim's neck.
he didn't give her the pass, she tore it off his neck.
Yeah, but was he alive or dead?
MESSER: See some kind of bubbles.
under the autograph.
monroe: Under the autograph.
that could be blood.
whatever it is, it was there before Kid Rock signed the pass.
let's get a sample, see if we can't tell where this is from.
you want to start?
I already told you everything.
I was at the show the whole time.
I didn't even go outside.
the pass that Kid Rock signed for you, it has Nick Russo's blood on it.
I got that from a roadie.
MESSER: And...
this pass has no chain on it, huh?
it's pretty hard to break one of those things off.
mind if we take a look in your bag?
thank you.
would you like to tell the story, Felicia?
or should we?
that jerk.
he said he would give me a pass.
if you...? Yeah...
...if I.
and... I did.
FELICIA: And then he says, "You're not getting anything.
so I looked in the glove compartment to get a pass, but I found this gun.
give me the pass.
give it to me!
I just wanted to get backstage so I could give Kid Rock my CD.
that's it.
the gun just went off in my hands.
well, it's not le I went there with the intention of killing someone.
did you struggle with Frankie over the statue?
no. Not at this point.
all I remember is that...
I was in a no-win situation.
I couldn't get to my Glock, and he had a knife.
may I see your hands?
you're shaking. You want to take a break?
no, no, no.
I want to get through this.
what are these cuts on your fingertips?
I don't know, Don.
you've been through a hell of an event, Stella.
we found you passed out.
remember?
I remember him tying my wrists together, but...
I have no idea why I have these cuts on my fingers.
Frankie: This is all your fault.
l stayed up two nights, poured my heart and soul into that statue, and you break us up because of a website?
that website...
was a celebration of our love.
and you treat me like...
like one of those whack jobs you meet on the street.
I love you.
I love you, too, Frankie.
you caught me off guard.
can you blame me?
you're right-- we should talk. Okay?
I loved your statue.
it's so beautiful.
and I loved all the "I love you" messages.
and I really meant to call you.
I did.
Yeah, but you didn't.
did you?
you ignored my calls.
you ignored me.
you don't love me.
now I'm going to teach you a thing or two about crime scenes.
okay, thanks.
the lab found your bloody fingerprints on the shaver that Mac found in your bathtub.
now, somewhere between you being in that tub and Mac and I finding you, you shot Frankie.
I remember a...
I remember the doorbell ringing, but I-I don't know why.
don't make a sound.
not a sound.
Frankie: How much?
damn it.
come on.
now, Frankie called Ying Yang's at 9: 37 p. m.
the receipt was printed up at 10: 04 p. m.
they're, what, five blocks from your apartment?
doorbell's ringing at 10: 30, tops.
neighbor calls 911 at 10: 57.
what happened in those last 30 minutes?
IAB handed your case over to the Detective Bureau.
they're going to deem it a good shoot.
thank you.
thanks for staying with me, Don. No sweat.
it's my job.
not to mention, you're a friend.
well, you're a very good friend.
come here.
Thanks.
you got it.
I heard somewhere you were getting out of here.
I can't just sit in my apartment on sick leave.
pour my heart out to some department counselor.
look, I want to respect your wishes on this, but
I'm telling you no.
you take some time.
you don't want to go home?
I certainly understand that.
your place is still a mess.
I'll check you into a hotel, long as you like.
park view. Done.
you need to take the proper steps.
when the time is right, want to come back and do tours, two shifts at a time, if you want.
you know I will.
when you're ready, not before.
crime scene cleanup hasn't gone through your place yet.
I'll take you to a hotel.
I'm a big girl.
if it's all right with you, I'd-I'd prefer to go home.
Thanks.
look out! Get out of the way!
move!
hold on!
here we go. Stop! Hold on!
son of a bitch!
man: Later, day trader!
maybe next time!
wear your water wings!
Oh, my God.
man: I need a little more slack.
give me a little more.
all right, that's good.
all right!
BONASERA: Mac, are you seeing this?
Yeah.
a mermaid, why not?
no throwing this one back.
this one's a keeper.
BONASERA: I thought the mermaid parade wasn't for another month.
the what?
TAYLOR: Mermaid parade.
the annual whacko-fest held every June down in Coney Island.
kicks off the summer.
got a homicide on 88th and Columbus.
Lindsay, you and Danny stay with the body.
let us know if you need anything.
you see a view like this?
huh? Beats the wheat fields, no?
have you ever even seen a wheat field?
what's to see?
it's just wheat.
BONASERA: That's not pretty.
what do we got?
single gunshot wound to the eye.
how you holding up?
I'm okay.
this type of precision, I'm guessing close range.
bottom of the stairs, maybe.
I'd say the shooter was waiting for him.
but where?
as far as the neighbors know, Mark Jeffries was a model citizen.
normal job, normal guy, helped old ladies with their packages.
I'll check to see if he was a Boy Scout, too.
any witnesses?
not a lot of pedestrian traffic up here, Mac.
that's my husband! That's Mark!
Oh, my God, it's Mark!
slow down, ma'am. That's my husband.
whoa, whoa, whoa! That man is my husband!
Oh, God.
I hate that part.
it's like being back in the morgue again.
take a deep breath.
it's hard to walk up and see that.
woman: No!
No! That's my husband!
what happened to Mark?!
let me through. Let me through.
what happened?!
it's okay, baby. Shh, it's okay.
it's okay.
well, I think that answers the Boy Scout question.
MESSNER: There's no trace under her fingernails.
doesn't look like she was in the water long.
seaweed could have kept her from being completely submerged.
no obvious signs of blunt or sharp force trauma.
petechial hemorrhaging.
she was strangled.
Yeah.
so whoever did this, did it the old fashioned way with his bare hands.
I'm gonna go see if someone filed a missing persons.
you can handle the rest without me?
Yeah.
we're a committed threesome.
and how exactly does that work?
well, you know how most couples are monogamous?
we're trinamous.
Trinogamous?
Yeah. We act like a married couple, only there's three of us.
so you all live here together?
and sleep together and have sex together.
all the normal things.
and how long have you been in this committed threesome?
a year and a half, formally.
formally?
we had a commitment ceremony.
I now pronounce you husband and wife... and wife.
all right.
I get the picture.
where were you coming from when you arrived at home this morning?
I had breakfast with a friend
and where was Laura?
at the grocery store.
I was gone maybe 20 minutes.
here's my card.
contact you as soon as we know something.
okay.
come here, sweetheart.
think we need to look a little further into their arrangement.
I'm not sure I can take much more.
were you able to rule out drowning as C.O.D?
no water in the lungs, petechial hemorrhaging, bruising around the neck.
your mermaid was killed on land.
can you estimate how long she was in the water?
usually with prolonged immersion, we'd see extreme wrinkling of the epidermis or washerwoman skin.
so, overnight.
doesn't look like she traveled far either.
no drag marks, scrapes, cuts.
no postmortem injuries consistent with being at the mercy of the East River's current.
so she was dumped close to where we find her.
Mm. I prepared a sexual assault kit, just in case, but the water likely diluted any evidence.
the only thing I did find...was unique scarring and calluses on both of her hands.
they appear old, difficult to tell where she got them.
rawhide braiding.
I'm sorry?
weaving together untanned hides to make reins for horses or lassos to herd cattle.
the friction and the pssure of the leather cuts you up pretty good.
my dad taught me when I was ten.
you think Danny calls me Montana 'cause I'm a 49ers fan?
he calls you that 'cause he's got a crush on you.
so your victim traveled far after all.
Jane Doe's a country girl.
FLACK: Who did you write that check to, sir?
she's dead?
murdered.
what was the check for, Mr. White?
I, uh, I hired her to sing.
last night was...
I-I'm sorry, she was murdered? How?
no, no, no.
last night was...
my daughter's birthday.
she turned eight-- I threw a party for her on the corporate boat, a slumber party.
Sara was part of the entertainment.
my daughter loves mermaids.
why Sara? A friend gave me her number, said that she'd be perfect.
we found $100 in her dress.
her bag with all her clothes, fell off the boat, sank like a rock.
and she walked home wearing mermaid clothes?
I offered her my coat, but she said she didn't live far and she'd be fine.
where do you keep the boat?
just off the Fulton Ferry.
can you tell me what happened to her?
I'll sum it up for you.
she was on your boat, you gave her an extra $100 because you felt bad, her bag is conveniently missing, and she wound up dead in the river not far from where you were docked.
FLACK: Mr. White, we're gonna need to take a look at your boat.
looks like Paul White may have hired Sara for more than just her singing.
SID: Normally, I would say that Mr. Jeffries was the luckiest man on the planet, but given the circumstances...
HAWKES: Wow. It's badly deformed.
that's odd, considering the depth of penetration.
Yeah. I didn't have to dig very far.
the bullet didn't strike any hard tissue.
which means it wasn't traveling at a high velocity.
probably shot from a great distance.
your shooter had pretty good aim.
you ever have a threesome?
: it's not as orious as you might imagine.
it's complicated dealing with the different personalities.
and, hey, sometimes, you're just not in the mood, if you know what I mean.
it's hard enough explaining that to one woman, let alone two.
and then there's... Sid.
anything else?
Oh. Just some trace on Don Juan's right fingers.
I'll send a sample to the lab.
okay.
there were these two vivacious young ladi.
of course, I was much yoger than I am now.
Sid, I got to go.
I got to go.
Hey, what are you looking at?
the bullet retrieved from Mark Jeffries.
the sum of one land and groove impression is 0. 165 inches.
consistent with a 0. 32 automatic.
Yeah. Good, so now we know what kind of gun we're looking for. It shouldn't be that deformed.
now, the bullet penetrated our victim's eye, but didn't hit the bone.
implies it hit an intermediary target.
but there was no evidence of that at the scene, Hawkes.
well, then...
for the last time, Paul, this was found in your bed, on your boat, along with semen and vaginal fluid, both of which are being tested while we speak.
wasn't because Sara lost her bag.
you were getting a little mermaid on the side.
am I right? No.
I'm a married man.
okay.
so we'll get a DNA sample from your wife.
all right, all right, all right... listen.
the semen in the bed is mine.
your tests will prove that.
all right. But I wasn't with Sara.
your tests should prove that, too.
now is the part where you give me a name.
that girl was 19 years old.
I'm begging you not to tell my wife.
I was with Leslie Shields during the party.
she was one of the parents on the boat.
FLACK: While your little girl is blowing out candles, you're in the other room cheating on your wife.
not one of my better moments, I agree.
no, and it still doesn't tell me how Sara's sequin got in your bed.
I let her get dressed in the stateroom.
I don't know, it must have fallen off.
I never touched Sara Butler. I swear.
our lovely threesome didn't start out that way.
mark Jeffries was legally married to Elle Jeffries three years ago.
Laura was an add-on.
okay, our vic and Elle were married for about a year, and the sex got routine.
they added Laura to spice things up.
look at this.
l didn't think this case could get more interesting, but it does.
five years ago, Laura shot her boyfriend in self-defense.
D.A. chose not to prosecute her.
she kill him?
shot him right in the chest.
she pulled the trigger once before, maybe the second time was easier.
let's go see what Laura has to say.
coming?
Yeah. Yeah.
are you looking for Laura or Elle?
and you are?
uh, Kevin Davis; I'm a friend of the family.
elle said she and you were having breakfast yesterday morning when Mark was shot.
I make a mean eggs Benedict.
detectives.
uh, we were just about to take off.
that's okay, you should take care of this.
I'll call you later.
it's actually Laura Wise, isn't it?
you and Mark weren't legally married.
BONASERA: But Mark and Elle were.
when I met them, they were married a year. So?
did you ever pressure Mark to get a divorce?
what?
you weren't his lawfully-wedded wife, and it's perfectly natural for him to pay more attention to Elle.
what are you implying?
that I killed my husband over a marriage license?
we're gonna need to test your hands for gunshot residue.
you're out of your mind.
both of you can go to hell.
Oh... Laura!
if you didn't do it, you should have no problem with the test.
you're not doing anything to me.
I can't believe this.
that's why you're here, to accuse me of murder?
wouldn't be the first time you've been accused of murder.
what did you say?
five years ago, you shot and killed your boyfriend.
it was self-defense-- the district attorney didn't go forward with t case.
Oh, even so, you pulled the trigger once.
I'll bet you had no trouble doing it again.
Whoa! Whoa! Hey! How dare you!
you know what you just did-- you assaulted an officer, Laura.
you understand what that means?
it means we can test your hands now.
get her out of here, put her in the car.
nice going, Mac.
how'd you know she was gonna slap you?
I didn't, I just thought she'd give me a little punch in the arm.
he would have killed me.
my ex-boyfriend.
if I didn't shoot him, he would have killed me.
I believe you.
no, you don't.
it's all right, I don't expect you to understand.
Laura, trust me.
I know what people you love are capable of doing.
you probably think I'm crazy, don't you?
a committed threesome, commitment ceremony...
life can get monotonous, so you add a little adventure, mix it up.
you're wasting your time, Detective.
no, Laura, I don't think I'm wasting my time.
you just tested positive for gunshot residue.
this isn't happening.
so you got any idea who did th to my girl?
not yet, no.
I always told her the city is no place for a Montana girl.
did Sara have a boyfriend or anybody she was having troubles with?
I uldn't know.
when was the last time you spoke with her?
I haven't spoken to Sara in over a year.
Why?
I'm sorry.
Sara had this dream... being in New York, being a singer.
you know, I told her it was a pipe dream.
one day, she comes to me, she says... she says, "Daddy I'm doing it. I'm going to New York.
you know what I said to her?
you walk out that door, there's no coming home.
that's the last thing I said to my daughter.
you didn't have any contact after that?
it was...
she'd call and talk to her mom.
at the end of every call, my wife would say, "I will."
I-I knew she was saying...
tell Day I love him.
MESSER: Talk about regret.
Yeah.
what's the story with the DNA?
turns out that Paul White told Flack the truth.
DNA from the boat doesn't match Sara.
and it's plausible that the sequins we found in the bed fell off when she was changing, you know?
so what do we have left?
you're looking at it.
Where's the sequin you found inaul's bed?
sequins fell off this thread.
this was the only sequin we found on the bed, right?
that's it.
so all the sequins had fallen off this thread.
but the others are out there.
maybe they can point us to where Sara was attacked.
she was killed right here.
Hello, James Vackner.
his palm print was on the hair comb.
score.
public intoxication, menacing, assault three, on parole for assault two.
his violence keeps escalating.
looks like he skipped assault one and went straight to murder.
let's check it out.
I got a rap sheet, I'm on parole
I got the perfect resume, am I right?
I fit the profile.
what do you say we get this over with and you just lock me up?
then I walked home.
through the park?
why do I get the feeling if l answer that question, I'm gonna be in big trouble?
you know what? You're already in big trouble, okay?
we found your print on a hair comb, Mr. Vackner.
Yeah, okay, I was walking.
I see this thing, it looks like a gold bracelet or something in the grass.
so I pick it up.
you know, maybe it's worth something.
turns out to be nothing, so I drop it.
there's a problem with that story.
you see, it's a unique print, okay?
it's not your run-of-the-mill thumbprint.
your palm touched that hair comb.
that doesn't happen just from picking it up, James.
look, I picked the thing up.
obviously, my palm touched it.
and the hits just keep on coming.
man: That's coming out of your pay, Vackner!
MESSNER: You wear those boots to work every day?
Yeah, the whole getup.
are we done?
Hey, Jose, I ain't paying for nothing!
it wasn't my fault.
Yeah.
we're done.
you think there's a large enough sample here from Vackner's boot?
shouldn't take much.
I found the tiniest bit of tree bark in the sample.
tree DNA.
insane, huh?
monroe: Match the sample from his boots to the soil at the crime scene, and we can put Vackner's boots in the dirt impression.
MESSNER: And Vackner himself at the scene of the crime.
and we got him.
GSR pattern on Laura's hands was strange.
I've never seen anything like it before.
the only residue l found ran along her pinkie line, and then down her wrist.
same pattern, along the pinkie line of both hands.
I've never seen that before either.
but it's enough for a warrant.
grab a 0. 32 and see if you can reconstruct the pattern.
Hawkes and I will check out the vic's apartment.
maybe Laura was stupid and hid the gun.
all right. I'll meet you back here. All right.
detective Taylor.
counselor.
you start returning phone calls?
I've been busy.
so I've heard.
my client, Mr. Pratt, says he's being harassed by someone in your department.
DJ Pratt is a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation, but I don't have anyone assigned to surveillance at this time.
so you're saying my client's making this up?
your client's a rapist, Counselor.
detective Burn, Crime Scene Investigator.
I know who you are.
you've turned this into a personal vendetta, haven't you?
it's not a vendetta, it's my job.
let me remind you of something, detective.
you've already gone down this road twice before.
both times, you hit a dead end.
first case, your victim wouldn't testify.
second, you had no evidence.
you know what they say about third times.
I'm filing a civilian complaint of malicious prosecution.
you do that. Are we done?
for now.
good.
get the hell out of my building.
welcome to the house of trinogamy.
Wow. I got to admit this is not what I expected.
I'll bite.
what were you expecting?
I don't know.
lava lamps, weird tapestries, a robo-spanker, maybe a couple of big...
all right, all right.
I'm sorry I asked.
check the kitchen.
we're looking for a .0 32 automatic.
Hey, Mac, there's three of everything.
except for the tub.
that's an odd chair for this room.
I got nothing.
if Laura's the shooter, she didn't keep the gun.
I got something.
apparently, Mark liked to watch.
or possibly someone else.
maybe this threesome wasn't all that committed.
BONASERA: Hey, Mac.
I tried to recreate the gunshot residue pattern on Laura's hands, and it was impossible.
so it was secondary transfer.
she still must have handled the gun.
I thought so, too, and then I started thinking, she hit your chest with a closed fist.
BONASERA: Whoa, whoa, hey! How dare you!
you want to test my shirt, don't you?
no GSR.
if there were residue along her pinkie lines, it would have transferred to you.
so she didn't have GSR on her hands when she hit me, but when you tested her at the precinct, she did.
where was she in between?
positive for GSR.
who was in this car before Laura Jeffries?
only had one arrest.
guy named Laurence Jackson.
What'd you pick him up on?
shooting by the railway yard.
he was cuffed just like Laura was.
and that's when it transferred from his hands to the seat, and the seat to her hands.
Laura isn't our shooter.
she never even handled the gun.
Thanks, Hendershot.
what do you got?
all right, thanks.
semen recovered from Mark Jeffries' bedroom-- two donors.
one on the bed, which belongs to Mark Jeffries, one next to the chair.
so our threesome is actually a foursome.
we found semen on the carpet in the bedroom that doesn't belong to Mark Jeffries.
who's the second donor?
it's the pinch hitter's.
pinch hitter?
we thought we needed to add another level to the relationship, so we asked a friend to join us.
and you call him the pinch hitter because...
because he doesn't get to play unless we call him to the plate.
he just sits there and watches.
we liked being watched.
even we get bored in bed sometimes.
so Kevin Davis is the pinch hitter.
BONASERA: Okay, so he's not allowed to touch you, but clearly the same rule doesn't apply to himself.
as long as he didn't cross the line.
maybe Kevin got a little tired of watching.
all you got to do is press here.
buzz him in.
all right, here we go.
gun. Right hip.
TAYLOR: Mr. Davis?
detective Taylor.
what can I do for you?
is there a problem?
no. There's no problem, sir.
TAYLOR: We'd like to ask you some questions, but we'd feel more comfortable if you weren't armed.
I have a license to carry this.
may I?
Yeah.
it's nine millimeter.
vic was shot with a 32.
is this the only gun you own, sir?
wait a minute. You think I shot Mark?
we know your role in the happy threesome, Kevin. Must be frustrating to sit on the sidelines like that. If Mark's out of the picture, you get called up from the minors, right?
I didn't want Mark out of the picture, okay?
I just... It was a matter of time before one of the girls approached me.
it turned out to be Elle.
elle was seeing you on the side? I wouldn't say seeing.
it happened once. Couple of days ago, she knocked on my door, said she couldn't stop thinking about me.
we did our thing, then again the next day, and that was that.
the others find out?
elle made me promise not to tell Mark or Laura, so I didn't.
why ruin a good thing, right?
right.
and for the record, that is the only gun I own.
remind me to switch banks.
FLACK: The suspense is killing me.
what happened with, uh, James Vackner's pants?
pants-- he washed 'em, the mutt.
you're kidding me.
so not even trace amounts of soil on the knees?
nada, but I got something better.
tell me. Oil.
consistent with the oil that leaked from the water taxi.
FLACK: So we place him at the dump site.
MESSER: Found drop-sized stains in the cuff of his work pants.
so what's next?
arrest James Vackner.
why Sara?
that's her name, Sara.
why her?
you know, let me show you something.
see, these items...right here, James?
what they do is, they tell us a story.
each one of them.
a story that ends with the death of a beautiful young girl at your hands.
monroe: She was an easy target, wasn't she?
monroe: She probably never knew you were behind her.
MESSER: And I bet you it didn't take much to force that little girl to the ground, did it?
that look familiar?
No!
monroe: Then when it was all over, you dumped her body in the river.
so it goes.
why'd you do it, James?
why Sara?
Hey, Mac, what does that look like to you?
Oh, it's the 0.32 slug pulled from the vic.
Yeah. I analyzed the lead.
it had trace amounts of copper.
it was jacketed?
the sum of one land and groove on a . 32 slug is 0. 165 inches.
add a copper jacket-- 0. 17 inches.
making it a nine millimeter bullet consistent with Kevin Davis's firearm.
exactly.
the round must have passed through something, stripping the copper jacket before entering the victim.
we need to find that copper jacket.
I don't see anything the bullet could have passed through.
we need to widen our scope.
increase the number of possible obstructions.
all right, even if the shooter wasn't lined up with the front door...
HAWKES: Hey, Mac! Stella!
Hey, you guys, you're gonna want to see this.
looks like gunshot residue.
TAYLOR: And blood.
shooter was right here.
collect samples and get them to trace.
if the shooter was there, what did the bullet pass through?
well, bullets are more fragile than you think.
it doesn't take much to strip the jacket.
metal, wood.
Hawkes, you said that the, uh...
the vic had newspaper ink on his fingers?
Yeah.
all five fingers, right hand.
even paper could do it.
ripped from the headlines.
TAYLOR: Do you know what "limp wrist" is in police jargon, Elle?
a totally different meaning in your world, I'm sure.
hmm. It's when a person doesn't have the strength to keep a gun from kicking.
the blast overpowers the wrist, causing it to move erratically.
you have a limp wrist, Elle.
that's it? That's what you've got?
look. Well, we've got your blood.
on the wall where you fired the gun.
it's over.
your only access to a gun was Kevin Davis, so you went to his apartment, seduced him, and stole his gun.
next morning you waited across the street until Mark came out.
then you went back to Kevin's, and as he was preparing his famous eggs Benedict, you returned the gun unnoticed.
what did Mark do to deserve a bullet to the head?
I was always second.
when the three of us were in bed, Mark always had sex with Laura first.
you have no idea how much it hurt to know that I wasn't something new anymore.
I became an afterthought.
why not just leave?
cut your losses?
I loved him.
and when I told him how I felt, he laughed.
said I was being stupid.
told me to get over it.
well, I was going to make sure he never laughed again.
and now I'm over it.
you okay?
Yeah.
just, uh, finishing up some stuff.
nice work on the Butler case.
Danny said you did a great job.
Thanks.
he also said you were struggling a bit with this one.
well, what if you don't get any answers?
sometimes bad things happen to good people, and you don't get to know why.
that doesn't work for me.
not gonna lie to you. It's hard. It eats at you.
we rarely have all the answers, Lindsay.
I still lose sleep over the ones that got away.
I want to know why.
why did you do it?
why Sara?
you came all the way down here for that?
these are the, uh, DNA results from all the open rape cases in the city.
none of them come back to D. J. Pratt.
but there are five cases where the evidence was either degraded or non-existent.
one has a similar M. O.
maybe Pratt, but...maybe not.
you can leave those.
Thanks, Adam. Good night. All right.
you're gonna catch this guy.
I know it.
good night.
five Hotel, this is Five Echo.
send it, Five Echo.
first squad in position. Target identified.
watch our 6: 00.
Semper.
target secure. We're clear.
they're in there, kids, I promise.
now, go in there and try and find them.
they're dressed just like me.
ready? Go! Come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
man down! Man down!
he's not in his cammies.
TAYLOR: That's his dress blue Delta uniform.
off-duty clothes. He's not part of the demonstration drills going on today.
single stab wound to the chest.
one drop of blood on the sleeve.
you know, he's off the path.
this doesn't look like a shortcut, so I'm guessing that he was dragged into the bushes.
this Marine's seen action.
global War on Terrorism Service Medal,
navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with a combat "V," Combat Action ribbon,
iraqi Campaign ribbon.
he's been overseas.
and this is how we welcome him home.
ambush in Central Park.
something's not right.
the shirt is tucked in.
his pants are creased.
there's no abrasions on his knuckles.
no dirt under his nails.
evidence there wasn't a struggle.
corporal Price was a decorated Marine trained in combat.
so why didn't he fight for his life?
found blood up on the path, Mac.
gravitational drops.
body temp's 82. 1.
he's been dead roughly 11 hours.
T. O.D. around midnight.
more blood.
directional drops leading away from the body.
swept the area twice, Mac.
killer didn't dump the weapon.
unfortunately, lowlifes know it's Fleet Week, also.
servicemen are easy targets 'cause they're easy to spot.
uniform isn't a bull's-eye. It's a badge of honor.
once a Marine, always a Marine.
if you attack one of us, you've attacked us all.
C. O.D. was straightforward: transection of the vena cava.
is there anything distinct about the wound that would help narrow down or specify a weapon?
wound is average in every way.
weapon: single-edged blade about three to four inches long.
there is, however, extensive bruising.
that's strange.
nothing on the scene or on his clothing to suggest he defended himself.
Oh, no. That's because, um...
the bruising happened well before he died.
see that? Yeah.
already a yellowish color.
few days old.
he fought with someone, and it was one hell of a battle.
sir, I'm Captain Flood.
I have orders to assist you in any way possible.
detective Mac Taylor.
battalion CO tell you why I'm here? Yes, sir.
corporal Price was a member of my platoon.
he's been murdered.
you were his company commander?
Yes, sir, I was.
his body was severely bruised.
his injuries are inconsistent with his murder.
I believe that his bruises were a result of your orders.
put him in the bull ring, didn't you? You understand, in combat, facing the enemy, a Marine needs to know that the man next to him will do his job, and do it well.
a corps of well-trained Marines will kick the crap out of anyone else in the world, but the platoon is only as strong at its weakest link.
corporal Price was the weak link in your platoon, so you put him in the bull ring to toughen him up.
sir, I put Corporal Price in the ring for the betterment of the platoon.
training against him made everyone stronger.
corporal Price was an outstanding Marine.
there's not a devil dog he served with that would wish him harm.
what about out there in the city?
he know anyone?
not that I'm aware of, sir.
I'll need to know everywhere the platoon went.
well, that's the thing, sir.
corporal Price didn't come with us.
he said that there was something he needed to take care of alone.
Hey. What do we got?
windows slightly cracked open, blacked out, bubbling paint...
and this.
HAWKES: Victim's unrecognizable.
soot stains on the roof and outside the door, but the engine compartment is undamaged.
think it's a torch job?
fire burned hot and fast.
there's no water damage or fire extinguisher residue.
why didn't the fire department put this out? No need.
windows weren't open enough to sustain the flames.
once the oxygen burned out, the fire extinguished itself.
burn patterns are contained in the front seat.
the rest of the vehicle just has surface charring.
this wasn't about torching a car.
it was about hiding a body.
ran the plate. No alarm on the car.
hasn't been reported stolen.
registered owner is a Charles Wright.
I can assure you this is not Charles Wright.
in fact, it's not even a "he."
the fire destroyed the external tissues, but the internal organs were somewhat preserved.
see what I mean?
Mm-hmm. Two circular bodies: ovaries.
triangular organ here: uterus.
victim's definitely female.
did she suffer?
Yeah, but not because of the fire.
no smoke in the lungs.
C. O.D. was blunt force trauma.
your killer showed no mercy.
Oh! Multiple fractures: frontal bone, zygomatic arch...
wow, left ulna.
ribs nine and ten on the right side.
she was beaten to death.
sexual assault? Collected a kit, but any physical evidence was likely destroyed by the fire.
any leads on her name?
fingerprints were burned off.
and dental comparisons only help to confirm identity, not establish it.
as of now, she's Jane Doe.
means I need to bring her back to life.
Hey.
Hey.
found a strange indentation in the armrest.
and on the window...
I found a print.
it's an ear.
a left ear. Huh.
whoever it belongs to was facing the wrong way in the passenger seat. Right.
and it looks the wrong size to be the victim's.
I think it's the killer's.
ear print is great evidence, it's just too bad it's not searchable in any database.
which is where this comes in.
Charles Wright, our R. O. is alive and well.
in fact, he just called in and reported that he witnessed his Cadillac being stolen outside of his brownstone an hour ago.
that's impossible.
we found the car three hours ago downtown already burned to a crisp.
there's no way he saw it being stolen.
exactly.
why is Charles Wright lying?
that's a sketch of the female victim from the burned Cadillac.
this is a FastScan image of the face.
a FastScan is a digital representation.
the resulting facial reconstruction isn't 100% accurate.
that's a scaled photo of the skull.
this is a photo
I pulled from the official NYPD file.
it's her, Mac.
we're going to get the son of a bitch who did this.
she was murdered in your car, Mr. Wright.
I don't know anything about a murder.
that girl burned beyond recognition in your front seat?
she was a detective. This is a mistake. I didn't... I didn't hurt anyone, okay? I didn't burn my car. You're lying!
all the evidence points back to you, Charles.
I want the truth. Tell me right now! I can't.
it'll ruin me. I don't care.
this isn't about you.
it's about her.
I cheated, okay?!
I cheated on my wife.
not with her, the detective. I don't know her.
then with who?
a prostitute.
a man.
I meet him once a week...
after work, at this cheap hotel off 11th Avenue.
I park around the corner.
I saw him last night late.
afterwards, I went to my car, but it was stolen, it was gone.
okay, I didn't know what to do.
if this got out, if my wife knew...
I took a cab home, I went to sleep, and today I acted like my car was stolen from in front of my house so my wife wouldn't know where I'd been.
but I had nothing to do with a murder or a fire.
you have to believe me.
no, I don't.
listen, whatever I have to do to prove I didn't do this, I will.
DNA, fingerprints, anything.
for now I want your prints, starting with your left ear.
mac, is this him? This is the scumbag that killed Aiden?!
Danny, get out of here. Just let me talk to him. Oh!
I will get him to crack, I promise you that. How?
by tuning him up?
Stella's got the case, she knows what to do.
this is Aiden.
she's one of our own, Mac.
that's why we can't make any mistakes.
we do this one by the book.
understand? You're right.
I just wanted to help. I know.
me, too.
the accelerant used to torch Charles Wright's car was lighter fluid.
easily purchased. Untraceable.
Yeah, unfortunately.
how well did you know her? Aiden.
is that the indentation I found on the passenger armrest? Yeah.
and I have no idea what it is.
Hey.
Hey, man.
you hear anything on your end regarding Aiden's case?
nothing new.
just rumors.
really.
we were supposed to have dinner this weekend.
actually, I was hoping she'd offer to cook.
she knew her way around the kitchen?
she made phenomenal chicken parm.
all right, listen to me.
I reached out to Corporal Price's family, he had an older brother.
now as far as his brother knew, our vic didn't know anyone in the city.
Really?
cause I found this...
in his pocket.
why wasn't he wearing it?
I don't know. Check out the back.
I'm your girl. Ellie.
I spoke to every Marine in Price's platoon.
no one mentioned a girlfriend.
that's just one of the many mysteries, Flack.
check this out. Exhibit A stain on his pants.
it's not blood. No.
it's not biological at all.
I don't know what it is. Same as this.
FLACK: Shoes immaculately polished.
tells us the scuff mark's out of place.
Yeah. Not as out of place as this.
a lima bean? Yeah, a lima bean.
dried. One of them. Found it in his pocket.
what the hell's that about? Depends.
could be nothing.
could be a major break in the case.
find any cash in his pockets? Nothing.
pockets weren't turned out, so I don't think this was a robbery.
I don't think it was a robbery, I think it was a fleecing.
come on, now, follow it, follow it.
don't blink.
here we go.
okay, my man, where's the bean?
that one.
damn, man.
service trained you well.
one more time. Give a brother a chance to win back some of his green.
double or nothing?
five will get you ten.
ten will get you 20.
20 will get you plenty.
go time, sailor. Where's it at?
right there.
snap! Told ya!
don't blink. Who's next?
who wants to play?
I'm feeling lucky.
rondo's closed.
that's a hell of a shiner you got.
dangers of doing business.
dangers of scamming people, you mean.
Hey, they put up their own money.
I ain't picking their pockets.
Yeah, but you don't play fair, either.
why you hassling me?
because of a Marine we found dead in Central Park.
I'll lower my flag to half mast.
you know what? Don't you test me today, Rondo,
I'm telling you right now, 'cause you won't win.
what, you sticking this on me? I don't know any Marines.
well, the lack of cash...
and the lima bean in his pocket would beg to differ.
and how does that single me out?
well, it's Fleet Week, Rondo.
the city's flush with money and your shell game, it's a dying art.
there's only a few crews still running it in the city.
and you're the only guy that got busted that uses a lima bean as a mark.
so I'm thinking you scammed him, maybe he popped you in the eye and that pissed you off.
so you followed him into Central Park, ambushed him.
you sure? Corporal Trevor Price.
take a good look.
that guy.
man, I didn't hurt him.
that brother was cool.
okay, sailor.
Where's it at?
there.
RONDO: He lost.
he took the bean as a souvenir.
said "Only in New York. Lesson learned."
walked off.
that was around 9: 00 last night.
never saw him again.
how'd you get the shiner?
the rest of the fleet wasn't so forgiving.
the next mark tagged me after I took him for two bills.
I didn't kill that Marine.
all right, well, then you won't mind giving me a DNA sample then, right?
made the notification to Aiden's father.
he's going to take care of the arrangements, keep us informed about dates and times.
we get a match?
not even close.
the ear print left on the car window definitely did not belong to Charles Wright.
doesn't clear him.
still could've killed Aiden.
when was the last time you saw her?
we spoke on the phone about a month ago.
you?
just last week, by chance.
Stella. Hey!
how are you? I'm great.
how are you? I'm good.
I'm real good. I'm working on my P. I. license.
good. Yeah, and another side project that I've been wanting to finish for a long time now.
you want to sit down? You have a minute?
Oh, not really.
I have someplace to be.
but when it all comes together, you'll be the first call I make.
I promise. Okay.
okay. Take care. Take care.
she never called.
I never called her, either.
all I had to do was pick up the phone.
we have no idea what was going on in her life.
let's go find out.
Hey, Mac, come take a look at this.
it's D. J. Pratt.
she was working her own investigation.
TAYLOR: This photo was taken two days ago.
Pratt's attorney claimed NYPD was following his client.
my client, Mr. Pratt, says he's being harassed by someone in your department.
D. J. Pratt is a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation, but I don't have anyone assigned to surveillance at this time.
we were never following him.
no, but Aiden was.
mac, what if Pratt found out it was her?
suddenly, the hunted became the hunter?
D. J. Pratt killed Aiden.
NYPD, what a surprise.
was my lawyer not clear with you, Detective Taylor?
stop harassing me.
or do I have to file a suit?
we know the truth, Pratt.
you're not going to slip through the cracks this time.
what are you accusing me of now?
murder.
I didn't kill anyone.
we're going to get you, I promise.
sounds like a threat to me.
I'm calling my lawyer.
good, make sure he starts preparing your defense for trial.
Hey, Pratt? For real?
looks that way.
you didn't lock him up?
mac, he's dirty. We're letting this guy walk around the city like he owns the place.
look, I know you're upset, and I am, too, but our hands are tied right now.
his lawyer's watching every move we make. I don't want to make a mistake and have him get off on a technicality.
all right, so until we have the evidence to charge Pratt, the law's going to protect him.
where we at with Rondo?
he scammed Corporal Price, took his cash, but not his life.
rondo's DNA doesn't match the sample from the vic's shirtsleeve.
what about Corporal Price's footlocker? Where is it?
that's in transit. It'll be here soon.
I do have a lead.
the vic was playing a shell game in Times Square at 9: 00 p. m. and was found dead in Central Park at midnight.
so where was he in between?
exactly. I found a scuff on the vic's shoe and it had traces of ammonia, paraffin, naphthene and aromatic hydrocarbons.
they're all components of a stoddard solvent.
a metal polisher.
I'm thinking brass cleaner, because I also found a stain on his pants-- beer, but not from your average six pack which had traces of propylene glycol and isoamyl acetate.
artificial flavoring.
banana, to be exact.
okay, so we got brass cleaner and banana beer.
you're thinking specialty bar.
boom. And I found one, the Yard Bar, three blocks from where Corporal Price was murdered.
their microbrew specialty is banana ale.
Flack's already there.
my name's Detective Flack. Alexandria.
can I ask you a couple questions about a customer who was in here last night?
sure, but I won't be much help -- I was off last night.
Damon, can you take this?
I'm sorry.
what's going on?
we don't see any troops up here, so when he came in, people noticed.
come on in.
welcome home, son.
come and have a beer. Beers are free for you tonight.
here, take my seat.
an impromptu welcome home party.
the guy's putting his ass on the line for us, the least we could do is show him we appreciate it.
how long did he stay?
until 11: 30 or so.
said he was looking for someone and he needed to find her.
her?
Yeah, girl named Ellie.
he thought she worked here. It's what brought him up this way in the first place.
but she doesn't work here? No.
I've been here three years. Last night's the first time I've ever even heard the name.
Thanks.
D. J. Pratt is the prime suspect in Aiden's murder, which means Charles Wright might have been telling the truth about his car being stolen. I don't get it.
D. J. Pratt is a rapist. Why is he stealing cars?
I don't know, but if we can tie him into the car theft, we can put him at the murder scene and that's all I can think about.
Danny talks about her a lot...
they were close.
I wish I could have met her.
you would have liked her.
I got some scratch marks here.
it was a Slim Jim.
tells us how they broke into the car.
doesn't tell us who.
well, this might.
there are tool marks in the ignition switch.
that's not all he left behind.
our thief popped the ignition with a paint-speckled tool.
when Mac and I confronted Pratt this afternoon, he'd been painting an apartment.
well, that makes these flecks pretty solid evidence.
mac, so Flack checked in.
seems the vic went down to the Yard Bar to meet a girl named Ellie.
I'm thinking it has something to do with the watch I found in his pocket.
the problem is, Ellie wasn't there.
so he left to look for her.
that was 11: 30. A half hour later he's dead.
any leads on Ellie?
Flack's following up.
right now she's a ghost.
amylase test came back on the blood from the shirtsleeve.
it's positive for mucus.
the killer's nose bled on Corporal Price's sleeve.
so how does that get us closer to knowing who the killer is?
price had been through the bullring.
he knew how to fight, he knew how to defend himself.
I'm glad you're here.
I want to try something.
you be the killer.
I'll be Corporal Price.
I want you to come at me like you're going to stab me in the chest overhand.
ready?
okay, disarmed you of the weapon, made sure you can't pick it back up.
Yes, you did, with a blow to my elbow.
all right, right around the joint, most likely causing a dislocation.
followed by an elbow to the nose, breaking it...
and finishing with a figure-four rear choke.
and my busted nose is going to cause me to bleed, explain the blood on the sleeve.
corporal Price was an experienced Marine.
he would have no problem overtaking a civilian attacker.
which is why there was no evidence of a struggle.
he also would have held that choke hold for at least 13 seconds cutting off blood flow until the attacker passed out.
that doesn't work, because if he was out cold, how's he gonna stab the vic in the chest?
means there was a second attacker.
one Corporal Price never saw coming.
one of the attackers has a severely-damaged right elbow and a broken nose.
two injuries that do not heal on their own.
no.
so one of our suspects is in the hospital.
find him.
Hey, Lindsay, what do we got?
well, the top spectrum has a chemical ID of the paint I pulled out of the ignition system, and the bottom spectrum is the chemical ID of the paint taken from the apartment D. J. Pratt was painting.
he stole the car. We got him.
not exactly. The name of the color is Navajo White.
it's extremely popular.
it's used in almost every building in the city.
look, you know Pratt did it, I know Pratt did it.
but I don't think this paint is strong enough evidence to prove it.
we're exactly where Aiden was eight months ago
wait a minute.
she didn't make a mistake. She made a choice.
this woman lived in the building that Pratt was painting.
Aiden would know if she fits Pratt's M. O.
Pratt used this blonde to lure Aiden into his trap.
what she didn't know is that he set the whole thing up.
man: Hey! Hey! Wait up!
he was targeting Aiden.
he stole Charles Wright's car with the intention of killing her in it.
mac, that indentation on the armrest of the burned-out car?
bite mark.
Pratt's?
that's what I'd hoped for, but no go.
bite belongs to Aiden.
I casted the maxillary dentition.
perfect match.
she bit down on the armrest during the attack.
Aiden left us everything we need to nail D. J. Pratt for good.
FLACK: His name's Keith Gale.
he's got a busted right elbow, fractured nose and a bruised trachea, just like you thought.
when was he admitted? Last night. 12: 10 a. m.
Flack, that's ten minutes after our estimated time of death.
the crime scene's three blocks from here.
it's walking distance.
this guy was unconscious.
he didn't get up and walk here on his own.
EMT respond to a call in the park?
no, he was dropped off.
by who? His wife.
the second attacker.
Where's the knife, Stacey?
this wasn't my fault. Oh, yes, it was.
look at me. Where's the knife?
I dropped it in the gutter.
at 72nd and Fifth Avenue.
look, you gotta understand, this was an accident.
I didn't have a choice. Yeah, you had plenty of choices.
you know, you just chose the wrong one.
your husband abuses you, and you filed, how many, four complaints in the last year alone.
and each time you dropped the charges.
look, sometimes, when Keith gets drunk, he loses his temper.
but he always apologizes.
I mean, he loves me.
right, right. This is how he shows you?
by squeezing your arms so tight that you bruise?
by, by splitting your lip?
by punching you in the jaw?
you don't know Keith.
Oh, I do know Keith.
last night, you two walking in Central Park.
probably had a few drinks.
he had one too many, again, and his demons come out-- on you.
does that sound familiar?
look, I had it under control.
all the Marine had to do was just keep walking.
stop! You're hurting me!
Hey!
I thought he'd killed my husband.
no. No, he just saved you.
and now he's dead.
you two happy?
finally got me.
I'm under arrest.
course, ten minutes from now, I'll be at Ray's enjoying a mushroom slice for lunch.
you're not going anywhere. No?
you picked me up on an unpaid parking ticket on my van, a crap charge if ever there was one.
maybe. But we got you in custody.
hmm. My lawyer is going to have a field day with you, Detective Taylor.
bring him on.
see, we knew the first thing you'd do is cry harassment, so we covered ourselves documented every single part of your booking.
this way you can't go whining to your lawyer about being mistreated.
Yeah. I remember the photo shoot.
there's an hour of my life I'll never get back.
see this? It's an ear print from the passenger side of a window of a burnt-out Cadillac.
and that's your left ear.
perfect match.
puts you in that Cadillac.
lift up your left sleeve.
no.
I'm not saying another word without my lawyer present.
you don't have to.
Aiden told us everything we need.
another photo from your booking.
that's a bite mark on your forearm.
Aiden bit you.
we know what you did.
BONASERA: Just so you know...
your lawyer can't protect you anymore.
TAYLOR: And we have the evidence to make sure you never see freedom again.
this folder...
will be right here on my desk till we get him.
how did you know that Aiden biting that armrest also meant that she bit Pratt?
homicide case six years ago.
a single mother was robbed and murdered on her way home from work.
I had a suspect, but only circumstantial evidence, not enough for a warrant.
so the case wasn't going to pan out, but there was this young detective who refused to give up.
wherever the suspect went, the detective was watching, waiting for him to make a mistake.
well, did the suspect make a mistake?
and that was enough to arrest him.
patting him down later on, the detective noticed a wound on his arm, a bite mark.
from the victim.
and that young detective was Aiden.
Aiden had to know that Pratt was going to kill her, that she was going to die.
so she left a clue.
she knew I'd understand.
I can stick around, if you want.
that's okay.
there's actually something I need to take care of.
well, that's the thing, sir.
corporal Price didn't come with us.
he said that there was something he needed to take care of alone.
seems the vic went down to the Yard Bar to meet a girl named Ellie.
I'm thinking it has something to do with the watch I found in his pocket.
ALEXANDRIA: I don't know how I can help you.
like I told the other detective,
I wasn't working last night.
I know, but, uh... I still think you may be able to answer my question.
this photo belonged to Corporal Trevor Price.
that's him on the left.
do you know who the other man is?
that's my fiance.
he died last year in Iraq.
but I don't understand.
this man, Corporal Price, I don't know him.
no, but, uh, I think he knew about you.
corporal Price came here last night on a mission.
to find a woman.
he was looking for you.
it's not very common, but a nickname for Alexandria...
is Ellie, isn't it?
only my fiance called me Ellie.
no one else.
but why would he share that information with Corporal Price?
I think your fiance wanted you to have something, and he knew he wouldn't be able to give it to you himself.
this belongs to you.
thank you.
MESSER: No, this is no lie.
she, Aiden, gets in my face, right?
you know how she did that.
and she tells me, "Keep dreaming, Messer."
you know, I think you're cute, but I am way out of your league.
I an, she could just cut you down like nobody else. Hey, Mac, glad you made it.
wouldn't miss it.
thank you.
all right.
to Aiden.
to Aiden.
to Aiden. To Aiden.
five hotel, this is five echo.

Semper.

I promise.
now, go in there and try and find them.
they're dressed just like me.
ready? Go! Come on!
let's go, let's go, let's go!
man down! Man down!
he's not in his cammies.
that's his dress blue delta uniform.
off-duty clothes.
he's not part of the demonstration drills going on today.
single stab wound to the chest.
one drop of blood on the sleeve.
you know, he's off the path.
this doesn't look like a shortcut, so I'm guessing that he was dragged into the bushes.
this marine's seen action.

his pants are creased.
there's no abrasions on his knuckles.
no dirt under his nails.
evidence there wasn't a struggle.
corporal Price was a decorated marine trained in combat.
so why didn't he fight for his life?
out here in the fields
I fought for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven,

he's been dead roughly 11 hours.
T.O.D. Around midnight.

killer didn't dump the weapon.
unfortunately, lowlifes know it's fleet week, also.
servicemen are easy targets 'cause they're easy to spot.
uniform isn't a bull's-eye.
it's a badge of honor.
once a marine, always a marine.
if you attack one of us, you've attacked us all.
C.O.D. Was straightforward:
transection of the vena cava.
is there anything distinct about the wound that would help narrow down or specify a weapon?
wound is average in every way.
single-edged blade about three to four inches long.
there is, however, extensive bruising.
that's strange.
nothing on the scene or on his clothing to suggest he defended himself.
Oh, no.
that's because, um...
the bruising happened well before he died.
see that?
Yeah.
already a yellowish color.
few days old.
he fought with someone, and it was one hell of a battle.
sir, I'm captain flood.
I have orders to assist you in any way possible.
detective Mac Taylor.
battalion co tell you why I'm here?
Yes, sir.
corporal Price was a member of my platoon.
he's been murdered.
you were his company commander?
Yes, sir, I was.
his body was severely bruised.
his injuries are inconsistent with his murder.
I believe that his bruises were a result of your orders.
put him in the bull-ring, didn't you?
you understand, in combat, facing the enemy, a marine needs to know that the man next to him will do his job, and do it well.
a corps of well-trained marines will kick the crap out of anyone else in the world, but the platoon is only as strong at its weakest link.
corporal Price was the weak link in your platoon, so you put him in the bull ring to toughen him up.
sir, I put corporal Price in the ring for the betterment of the platoon.
training against him made everyone stronger.
corporal Price was an outstanding marine.
there's not a devil dog he served with that would wish him harm.
what about out there in the city?
he know anyone?
not that i'm aware of, sir.
I'll need to know everywhere the platoon went.
well, that's the thing, sir.
corporal Price didn't come with us.
he said that there was something he needed to take care of alone.
Hey.
what do we got?
windows slightly cracked open, blacked out, bubbling paint...
and this.
victim's unrecognizable.
soot stains on the roof and outside the door, but the engine compartment is undamaged.
think it's a torch job?
fire burned hot and fast.
there's no water damage or fire extinguisher residue.
why didn't the fire department put this out?
no need.
windows weren't open enough to sustain the flames.
once the oxygen burned out, the fire extinguished itself.
burn patterns are contained in the front seat.
the rest of the vehicle just has surface charring.
this wasn't about torching a car.
it was about hiding a body.
ran the plate.
no alarm on the car.
hasn't been reported stolen.
registered owner is a Charles Wright.
I can assure you this is not Charles Wright.
in fact it's not even a "he."
the fire destroyed the external tissu, but the internal organs were somewhat preserved.
see what I mean?
two circular bodies: Ovaries.
triangular organ here: Uterus.
victim's definitely female.
did she suffer?
Yeah, but not because of the fire.
no smoke in the lungs.
C O.D. Was blunt force trauma.
your killer showed no mercy.
Oh! Multiple fractures: Frontal bone, zygomatic arch...
wow, left ulna.
ribs nine and ten on the right side.
she was beaten to death.
sexual assault?
collected a kit, but any physical evidence was likely destroyed by the fire.
any leads on her name?
fingerprints were burned off.
d dental comparisons only help to confirm identity, not tablish it.
as of now, she's jane doe.
means I need to bring her back to life.
Hey. - Hey.
found a strange indentation in the armrest.
and on the window...
I found a print.
it's an ear.
a left ear. - Huh.
whoever it belongs to was facing the wrong way in the passenger seat.
right.
and it looks the wrong size to be the victim's.
I think it's the killer's.
ear print is great evidence, it's just too bad it's not searchable in any database.
which is where this comes in.
Charles Wright, our R. O.
is alive and well.
in fact, he just called in and reported that he witnessed his Cadillac being stolen outside of his brownstone an hour ago.
that's impossible.
we found the car three hours ago downtown already burned to a crisp.
there's no way he saw it being stolen.
exactly.
why is Charles Wright lying?
that's a sketch of the female victim from the burned Cadillac.
this is a fastscan image of the face.
a fastscan is a digital representation.
the resulting facial reconstruction isn't 100% accurate.
that's a scaled photo of the skull.
this is a photo I pulled from the official NYPD file.
it's her, Mac.
we're going to get the son of a bitch who did this.
she was murdered in your car, Mr. Wright.
I don't know anything about a murder.
that girl burned beyond recognition in your front seat?
she was a detective.
this is a mistake.
I didn't ... I didn't hurt anyone, okay?
I didn't burn my car.
you're lying!
all the evidence points back to you, Charles.
I want the truth.
tell me right now!
I can't.
it'll ruin me.
I don't care.
this isn't about you.
it's about her.
I cheated, okay?!
I cheated on my wife.
not with her, the detective.
I don't know her.
then with who?
a prostitute.
a man.
I meet him once a week...
after work, at this cheap hotel off 11th avenue.
I park around the corner.
I saw him last night late.
afterwards, I went to my car, but it was stolen, it was gone.
okay, I didn't know what to do.
if this got out, if my wife knew...
I took a cab home,
I went to sleep, and today I acted like my car was stolen from in front of my house so my wife wouldn't know where I'd been.
but I had nothing to do with a murder or a fire.
you have to believe me.
no, I don't.
listen, whatever I have to do to prove I didn't do this, I will.
DNA, fingerprints, anything.
for now I want your prints, starting with your left ear.
mac, is this him?
this is the scumbag that killed Aiden?!
Danny, get out of here.
just let me talk to him. Oh!
I will get him to crack,
I promise you that.
how?
by tuning him up?
Stella's got the case, she knows what to do.
this is Aiden.
she's one of our own, Mac.
that's why we can't make any mistakes.
we do this one by the book.
understand?
you're right. I just wanted to help.
I know.
me, too.
the accelerant used to torch charles wright's car was lighter fluid.
easily purchased.
untraceable.
Yeah, unfortunately.
how well did you know her?
well enough to know that if one of us had been killed, she wouldn't sleep until the killer was caught.
is that the indentation I found on the passenger armrest? - Yeah.
and I have no idea what it is.
Hey. - Hey, man.
you hear anything on your end regarding Aiden's case?
nothing new.
just rumors.
really.
we were supposed to have dinner this weekend.
actually, I was hoping she'd offer to cook.
she knew her way around the kitchen?
she made phenomenal chicken parm.
all right, listen to me.
I reached out to Corporal Price's family, he had an older brother.
now as far as his brother knew, our vic didn't know anyone in the city.
Really?
cause I found this...
in his pocket.
why wasn't he wearing it?
I don't know.
check out the back.
I'm your girl. Ellie.
I spoke to every marine in Price's platoon.
no one mentioned a girlfriend.
that's just one of the many mysteries, Flack.
check this out.
exhibit a
stain on his pants.
it's not blood. - No.
it's not biological at all.
I don't know what it is.
same as this.
shoes immaculately polished.
tells us the scuff mark's out of place.
Yeah.
not as out of place as this.
a lima bean? - Yeah, a lima bean.
dried. One of them.
found it in his pocket.
what the hell's that about?
depends. Could be nothing.
could be a major break in the case.
find any cash in his pockets?
nothing.
pockets weren't turned out, so I don't think this was a robbery.
I don't think it was a robbery,
I think it was a fleecing.
yo, dude, you're dead wrong you'll never have the skills like mine
I have the real tight rhymes...
come on, now, follow it, follow it.
don't blink.
here we go.
okay, my man, where's the bean?
that one.
damn, man.
service trained you well.
one more time.
give a brother a chance to win back some of his green.
double or nothing?
five will get you ten.
ten will get you 20.
20 will get you plenty.
go time, sailor.
Where's it at?
right there.
snap! Told ya!
don't blink.
who's next?
who wants to play?
I'm feeling lucky.
rondo's closed.
that's a hell of a shiner you got.
dangers of doing business.
dangers of scamming people, you mean.
Hey, they put up their own money.
I ain't picking their pockets.
Yeah, but you don't play fair, either.
why you hassling me?
because of a marine we found dead in central park.
I'll lower my flag to half mast.
you know what?
don't you test me today, Rondo,
I'm telling you right now, 'cause you won't win.
what, you sticking this on me?
I don't know any marines.
well, the lack of cash...
and the lima bean in his pocket would beg to differ.
and how does that single me out?
well, it's fleet week, Rondo.
the city's flush with money and your shell game, it's a dying art.
there's only a few crews still running it in the city.
and you're the only guy that got busted that uses a lima bean as a mark.
so I'm thinking you scammed him, maybe he popped you in the eye and that pissed you off.
so you followed him into central park, ambushed him.
you sure?
corporal Trevor Price.
take a good look.
that guy.
man, I didn't hurt him.
that brother was cool.
okay, sailor.
Where's it at?
there.
he lost.
he took the bean as a souvenir.
said "only in new york."
lesson learned.
walked off.
that was around 9: 00 last night.
never saw him again.
how'd you get the shiner?
the rest of the fleet wasn't so forgiving.
the next mark tagged me after I took him for two bills.
I didn't kill that marine.
all right, well, then you won't mind giving me a dna sample then, right?
made the notification to Aiden's father.
he's going to take care of the arrangements, keep us informed about dates and times.
we get a match?
not even close.
the ear print left on the car window definitely did not belong to Charles Wright.
doesn't clear him.
still could've killed Aiden.
when was the last time you saw her?
we spoke on the phone about a month ago.
you?
just last week, by chance.
Hey! - How are you?
I'm great. - How are you?
I'm good.
I'm real good.
I'm working on my P.I. License. - Good.
Yeah, and another side project that I've been waiting to finish for a long time now.
you want to sit down?
you have a minute?
Oh, not really.
I have someplace to be.
but when it all comes together, you'll be the first call I make.
I promise.
take care. - Take care.
she never called.
I never called her, either.
all I had to do was pick up the phone.
we have no idea what was going on in her life.
let's go find out.
Hey, Mac, come take a look at this.
it's D. J. Pratt.
she was working her own investigation.
this photo was taken two days ago.
Pratt's attorney claimed NYPD was following his client.
my client, Mr. Pratt, says he's being harassed by someone in your department.
D. J. Pratt is a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation, but I don't have anyone assigned to surveillance at this time.
we were never following him.
no, but Aiden was.
mac, what if pratt found out it was her?
suddenly, the hunted became the hunter?
D. J. Pratt killed Aiden.
NYPD, what a surprise.
was my lawyer not clear with you, Detective Taylor?
stop harassing me.
or do I have to file a suit?
we know the truth, Pratt.
you're not going to slip through the cracks this time.
what are you accusing me of now?
murder.
I didn't kill anyone.
we're going to get you, I promise.
sounds like a threat to me.
I'm calling my lawyer.
good, make sure he starts preparing your defense for trial.
Hey, Pratt?
for real?
looks that way.
you didn't lock him up?
mac, he's dirty.
we're letting this guy walk around the city like he owns the place.
look, I know you're upset, and I am, too, but our hands are tied right now.
his lawyer's watching every move we make.
I don't want to make a mistake and have him get off on a technicality.
all right, so until we have the evidence to charge Pratt, the law's going to protect him.
where we at with Rondo?
he scammed Corporal Price, took his cash, but not his life.
rondo's DNA doesn't match the sample from the vic's shirtsleeve.
what about corporal Price's footlocker?
where is it?
that's in transit.
it'll be here soon.
I do have a lead.
the vic was playing a shell game in times square at 9: 00 P. M.
and was found dead in central park at midnight.
so where was he in between?
exactly.
I found a scuff on the vic's shoe and it had traces of ammonia, paraffin, naphthene and aromatic hydrocarbons.
they're all components of a stoddard solvent.
a metal polisher.
I'm thinking brass cleaner, because I also found a stain on his pants -- beer, but not from your average six pack
which had traces of propylene glycol and isoamyl acetate.
artificial flavoring.
banana, to be exact.
okay, so we got brass cleaner and banana beer.
you're thinking specialty bar.
boom.
and I found one, the yard bar, three blocks from where Corporal Price was murdered.
their microbrew specialty is banana ale.
Flack's already there.
my name's Detective Flack.
can I ask you a couple questions about a customer who was in here last night?
sure, but I won't be much help
I was off last night.
Damon, can you take this?
I'm sorry.
what's going on?
remember this guy from last night sometime between 9: 00 and midnight?
Yeah, the marine, Price.
fleet week's big for the strip clubs.
we don't see any troops up here, so when he came in, people noticed.
come on in.
welcome home, son.
come and have a beer.
beers are free for you tonight.
here, take my seat.
an impromptu welcome home party.
the guy's putting his ass on the line for us, the least we could do is show him we appreciate it.
how long did he stay?
until 11: 30 or so.
said he was looking for someone and he needed to find her.
her?
Yeah, girl named Ellie.
he thought she worked here.
it's what brought him up this way in the first place.
but she doesn't work here?
no.
I've been here three years.
last night's the first time i've ever even heard the name.
Thanks.
D. J. Pratt is the prime suspect in aiden's murder, which means Charles Wright might have been telling the truth about his car being stolen.
I don't get it.
D. J. Pratt is a rapist.
why is he stealing cars?
I don't know, but if we can tie him into the car theft, we can put him at the murder scene and that's all I can think about.
Danny talks about her a lot...
they were close.
I wish I could have met her.
you would have liked her.
I got some scratch marks here.
it was a slim jim.
tells us how they broke into the car.
doesn't tell us who.
well, this might.
there are tool marks in the ignition switch.
that's not all he left behind.
our thief popped the ignition with a paint-speckled tool when Mac and I confronted pratt this afternoon, he'd been painting an apartment.
well, that makes these flecks pretty solid evidence.
Mack, so Flack checked in.
seems the vic went down to the yard bar to meet a girl named Ellie.
I'm thinking it has something to do with the watch I found in his pocket.
the problem is, Ellie wasn't there.
so he left to look for her.
that was 11: 30.
a half hour later he's dead.
any leads on Ellie?
Flack's following up.
right now she's a ghost.
amylase test came back on the blood from the shirtsleeve.
it's positive for mucus.
the killer's nose bled on Corporal Price's sleeve.
so how does that get us closer to knowing who the killer is?
price had been through the bullring.
he knew how to fight, he knew how to defend himself.
I'm glad you're here.
I want to try something.
you be the killer.
I'll be Corporal Price.
I want you to come at me like you're going to stab me in the chest overhand.
ready?
okay, disarmed you of the weapon, made sure you can't pick it back up.
Yes, you did, with a blow to my elbow.
all right, right around the joint, most likely causing a dislocation.
followed by an elbow to the nose, breaking it...
and finishing with a figure-four rear choke.
and my busted nose is going to cause me to bleed, explain the blood on the sleeve.
corporal Price was an experienced marine.
he would have no problem overtaking a civilian attacker.
which is why there was no evidence of a struggle.
he also would have held that choke hold for at least 13 seconds
cutting off blood flow until the attacker passed out.
that doesn't work, because if he was out cold, how's he gonna stab the vic in the chest?
means there was a second attacker.
one Corporal Price never saw coming.
one of the attackers has a severely-damaged right elbow and a broken nose.
two injuries that do not heal on their own.
no.
so one of our suspects is in the hospital.
find him.
Hey, Lindsay, what do we got?
well, the top spectrum has a chemical id of the paint I pulled out of the ignition system, and the bottom spectrum is the chemical id of the paint taken from the apartment D.J. Pratt was painting.
he stole the car.
we got him.
not exactly.
the name of the color is Navajo white.
it's extremely popular.
it's used in almost every building in the city.
look, you know Pratt did it, I know Pratt did it.
but I don't think this paint is strong enough evidence to prove it.
we're exactly where Aiden was eight months ago
staring the criminal right in the face and powerless to bring him to justice.
how could this have happened, Mac?
Aiden was smart.
she was a great cop.
she knew Pratt was dangerous.
why would she get so close, following him, all these photos?
this case haunted her.
Aiden sacrificed her career trying to get D. J. Pratt.
wait a minute.
she didn't make a mistake.
she made a choice.
this woman lived in the building that Pratt was painting.
Aiden would know if she fits Pratt's M.O.
Pratt used this blonde to lure Aiden into his trap.
what she didn't know is that he set the whole thing up.
Hey! Hey! Wait up!
he was targeting Aiden.
he stole Charles Wright's car with the intention of killing her in it.
mac, that indentation on the armrest of the burned-out car?
bite mark.
Pratt's?
that's what I'd hoped for, but no go.
bite belongs to Aiden.
I casted the maxillary dentition.
perfect match.
she bit down on the armrest during the attack.
Aiden left us everything we need to nail D. J. Pratt for good.
his name's Keith Gale.
he's got a busted right elbow, fractured nose and a bruised trachea, just like you thought.
when was he admitted?
last night.
12: 10 A. M.
Flack, that's ten minutes after our estimated time of death.
the crime scene's three blocks from here.
it's walking distance.
this guy was unconscious.
he didn't get up and walk here on his own.
EMT respond to a call in the park?
no, he was dropped off.
by who?
his wife.
the second attacker.
Where's the knife, Stacey?
this wasn't my fault.
Oh, yes, it was. - Look at me.
Where's the knife?
I dropped it in the gutter.
at 72nd and fifth avenue.
look, you gotta understand, this was an accident.
I didn't have a choice.
Yeah, you had plenty of choices.
you know, you just chose the wrong one.
your husband abuses you, and you filed, how many, four complaints in the last year alone.
and each time you dropped the charges.
look, sometimes, when keith gets drunk, he loses his temper.
but he always apologizes.
I mean, he loves me.
right, right.
this is how he shows you?
by squeezing your arms so tight that you bruise?
by, by splitting your lip?
by punching you in the jaw?
you don't know Keith.
Oh, I do know Keith.
last night, you two walking in central park.
probably had a few drinks.
he had one too many, again, and his demons come out -- on you.
does that sound familiar?
look, I had it under control.
all the marine had to do was just keep walking.
stop! You're hurting me!
I thought he'd killed my husband.
no. No, he just saved you.
and now he's dead.
you two happy?
finally got me.
I'm under arrest.
course, ten minutes from now,
I'll be at Ray's enjoying a mushroom slice for lunch.
you're not going anywhere.
no?
you picked me up on an unpaid parking ticket on my van, a crap charge if ever there was one.
maybe.
but we got you in custody.
hmm.
my lawyer is going to have a field day with you, Detective Taylor.
bring him on.
see, we knew the first thing you'd do is cry harassment, so we covered ourselves
documented every single part of your booking.
this way you can't go whining to your lawyer about being mistreated.
Yeah. I remember the photo shoot.
there's an hour of my life I'll never get back.
see this?
it's an ear print from the passenger side of a window of a burnt-out Cadillac.
and that's your left ear.
perfect match.
puts you in that Cadillac.
lift up your left sleeve.
no.
I'm not saying another word without my lawyer present.
you don't have to.
Aiden told us everything we need.
another photo from your booking.
that's a bite mark on your forearm.
Aiden bit you.
we know what you did.
just so you know...
your lawyer can't protect you anymore.
and we have the evidence to make sure you never see freedom again.
this folder...
will be right here on my desk till we get him.
how did you know that Aiden biting that armrest also meant that she bit Pratt?
homicide case six years ago.
a single mother was robbed and murdered on her way home from work.
I had a suspect, but only circumstantial evidence, not enough for a warrant.
so the case wasn't going to pan out, but there was this young detective who refused to give up.
wherever the suspect went, the detective was watching, waiting for him to make a mistake.
well, did the suspect make a mistake?
the detective was so in his head that he lashed out, took a swing, and that was enough to arrest him.
patting him down later on, the detective noticed a wound on his arm, a bite mark.
from the victim.
and that young detective was Aiden.
Aiden had to know that Pratt was going to kill her, that she was going to die.
so she left a clue.
she knew I'd understand.
I can stick around, if you want.
that's okay.
there's actually something I need to take care of.
well, that's the thing, sir.
corporal Price didn't come with us.
he said that there was something he needed to take care of alone.
seems the vic went down to the yard bar to meet a girl named Ellie.
I'm thinking it has something to do with the watch I found in his pocket.
I don't know how I can help you.
like I told the other detective,
I wasn't working last night.
I know, but, uh...
I still think you may be able to answer my question.
this photo belonged to Corporal Trevor Price.
that's him on the left.
do you know who the other man is?
that's my fiance.
he died last year in Iraq.
but I don't understand.
this man, Corporal Price, I don't know him.
no, but, uh,
I think he knew about you.
corporal Price came here last night on a mission.
to find a woman.
he was looking for you.
it's not very common, but a nickname for Alexandria...
is Ellie, isn't it?
only my fiance called me Ellie.
no one else.
but why would he share that information with Corporal Price?
I think your fiance wanted you to have something, and he knew he wouldn't be able to give it to you himself.
this belongs to you.
thank you.
no, this is no lie.
she, Aiden, gets in my face, right?
you know how she did that.
and she tells me, "keep dreaming, messer."
you know, I think you're cute, but I am way out of your league.
I am, she could just cut you down like nobody else.
Hey, Mac, glad you made it.
wouldn't miss it.
thank you.
all right.
to Aiden.
to Aiden. - To Aiden. - To Aiden.
the bottle's made of ice for the party, but when it hits the markets, it'll be glass.
can I fill you up?
make it a double.
you want to try both flavors?
here you go.
party time.
this is awesome.
check this out.
this is my masterpiece.
Buri vodka.
I'd rather have her.
straight up, or on the rocks?
which one tastes better?
ladies and gentlemen, presenting Buri vodka's ice princess!
she's bleeding!
it's Liam!
Oh, my god.
call an ambulance! Call 911! - Stay with her.
I'll go get help.
party was for the release of a new vodka.
DOA is Tonya Nettles, the face of the promotional campaign.
statements?
looks like she was killed in the basement before she came up on that platform.
access to the basement?
Yeah, there's a stairway.
the manager, a guy called Colin Flynn, said that only employees have access.
well, see what else you can get, and I'll have a look at the victim.
Messer: I'm sorry, Mac.
I got hung up.
no retraction marks.
and the blood in the fabric looks diluted.
weapon was either soaking wet...
or...
she was stabbed with an icicle?
that's cold.
not cold enough.
our evidence is about to turn into a big pool of water.
love Run Cold
the air conditioning's been lowered to 55 degrees.
this dry ice will help stabilize the ambient temperature.
ice is about 25 degrees.
given the surface area of the crime scene, we have about an hour maximum to procure what evidence may still be here.
these icicles could be part of the murder weapon.
well, we don't have much time to find out.
you got the scene?
you good?
Yeah.
first priority's up here.
I got uniforms keeping the crime scene secure downstairs till you get there.
keep me posted. - All right.
and work fast.
the manager said everyone who handled the ice bottles was told to wear gloves.
everyone but our killer.
the dirty underbelly of show business.
it can't all be glitz and glamour.
Tonya Nettles would not disagree with that.
it's been a long time since I've been stood up on a date.
more wine, sir?
sorry, Danny.
something came up.
phone's not working, or...
I'm really sorry.
are we all right?
Yeah.
sure.
these are the ice versions of the commercial product.
they were filled with vodka for the party.
all right, so this lift is operated from upstairs.
think those are from someone at the party?
well, they weren't our victim's.
she wasn't wearing feathers this color.
from her killer?
well, if they are, looks like he flew the coop.
you're Tonya's boyfriend?
I was visiting my parents up in Beaverkill, and I got stuck on the Tapanzee bridge coming back.
I thought she'd be so mad if I was late, so I changed in the car on the way here.
miss, you were asked to stay inside till the detective talked to you.
I needed a cigarette.
I've been here all night. It's nearly 5: 00 a. m.
when was the last you saw Tonya Nettles?
not until her grand entrance.
she was in the basement primping. I was up here working.
is there anyone that can vouch for that?
the manager.
won't let you go pee without asking him first.
take a minute.
I'll be right back.
get anything?
negative.
the bouncer said nobody left the bar after Tonya was discovered.
so our witness list might be our suspect list.
runners, take your marks.
three!
two!
one!
runners, proceed with caution.
please follow the cones.
the course has been diverted.
please follow the cones.
proceed with caution.
the course has been diverted.
please follow the cones.
looks like he was pushed, hit his head on the curb.
with all the crap on the ground, he could have easily lost his footing.
lost more than his footing.
what makes somebody want to run 26. 2 miles anyway?
read the sign.
brightness of the blood, lividity of the face-- classic signs.
of?
cyanide poisoning.
in the middle of a marathon?
how?
the aid station.
Hey!
no more water!
shut this station down!
the water's bad!
let's get it out of here!
pour it out!
pour it out!
dump it!
be thorough.
every cup. Anything you can find.
the volunteers wear gloves, so even if one of them did poison our victim, we wouldn't get any prints.
could still get poison trace.
true.
it's a high pressure valve.
an odd thing to find at a marathon.
senior vice president, Latchford financial partnerships.
a player.
cause of death was definitely not natural.
he was in superb shape.
lungs, heart, all the vital organs, near perfect.
so you're saying he's actually still alive?
toxicity came back negative for cyanide poisoning.
there's also this.
looks like frostbite.
Yeah.
related to COD?
well, he didn't freeze to death, if that's what you mean.
it's 90 degrees out there.
bright red blood color, facial lividity.
rapid system failure.
Cyanide's not the only substance that would cause these symptoms.
right.
so, what else could it be?
well, possibly a hemoglobin inhibitor, like carbon monoxide.
co molecules absorbed by red blood cells destroy the blood's ability to carry oxygen, leading to tissue death and organ failure.
same symptoms as cyanide.
just my opinion, but cyanide seems a lot simpler way to kill someone.
murder's never simple, Doctor.
now I've seen your crimes I know they're not for me all this time together makes it easy to see...
you ready?
warming up as we speak.
looks like some sort of egg, but the ELISA will tell us for sure.
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
you're soaking in it.
fish eggs.
what are fish eggs doing on a marathon runner's shirt?
autopsy results?
this is a good one.
a runner who somehow has frostbite on his face in 90-degree heat, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the middle of central park.
that's just not possible.
an interesting case.
Tonya Nettles was stone cold sober.
aren't most people when they're at work, Sid?
I'll ignore the implication of your question, Detective.
I only remark on it because the young lady's blood alcohol content was zero percent but her stomach was filled with vodka.
that happens how?
the alcohol entered her body either at the time of death or immediately afterwards.
I'd say the vodka came in via this wound in her stomach.
well, the waitresses were pouring vodka from bottles made of ice.
you know, the promoter said that she was supposed to be holding a big ice scepter when she came up，which is also filled with vodka.
I also found this trace on her cheek over her make-up-- some kind of grease.
Tonya had a compact.
she would have checked her face last.
did she have any trace on her hands?
nary a one.
if she didn't put it there herself...
we have to find out who did.
the nozzle was modified to allow the largest possible burst of gas，which would maximize and accelerate the effect.
combined with fatigue at mile 25 of a marathon...
less than a second's worth of the gas would have been enough to kill.
explains the frostbite also.
adiabatic cooling of the gas due to rapid pressure drop.
exacerbated by the nozzle modification.
the gas would have been ice cold.
I think this nozzle is one piece of our murder weapon.
who uses carbon monoxide?
well, there are several practical applications.
calibration of home gas detectors, semiconductor fabrication.
it's also a preservative, right?
Yeah, but that doesn't help us much.
you know what does help us?
is the fact that this was a premeditated attack on a specific target, and there has to be a motive out there somewhere.
Flack and his guys talked to all the volunteers and spectators, right?
he didn't find anyone with a connection to the victim.
all right, we have the how, but not the whom or the why.
time to cast our net a little wider.
let's re-examine the crime scene.
all right.
you still with us?
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I just-- I can't get over the fact that this happened and that no one saw anything.
I've been going over these feathers.
they're mostly rooster, ostrich, that sort of thing.
more than likely came from the costumes the waiters were wearing at the party.
you getting anything back off the print from the scepter?
nothing in AFIS, but I did get a source for the smear on Tonya's cheek.
soy oil.
some kind of make-up?
soy oil's significant property is its ability to withstand extreme cold.
from the hydraulic lift at the club.
but the way that platform was set up, Tonya couldn't have touched the grease.
well, transferred to Tonya by somebody she worked with maybe?
no codes hit on the blood from the safety pin, and the DNA sample from the gum was too corrupted to say anything more than that it came from a woman...
but we do know it's not from Tonya Nettles.
I'm pulling a list of employees.
there's our boy, Flack, the manager from the club.
all right, let's go.
Colin Flynn?
that's me.
new York police station
we got a couple of questions for you, all right?
do I have to answer?
I'm a cop, not a lawyer, but yeah, you do.
what's that under your eye, Mr. Flynn?
my cat scratched me.
Yeah, I got to tell you-- I don't know what you think, Detective-- but you don't really look like a cat person to me.
you sure you didn't hurt yourself at work last night?
maybe playing peek-a-boo with some of the girls at the party?
okay, sure, I was checking out that girl.
I wanted to see if she'd fit in that tiny little costume.
she caught me.
what can I say?
get the hell out of here.
we're gonna need to get your fingerprints.
you're going to charge me with something?
you want us to?
Hey, that's harassment, man.
you know what? You're right.
you're right.
it's my fault.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You can go. Go ahead.
that was good.
you like that?
Yeah.
got it?
got it.
I've matched Owen Reid's projected finish time with the runners he would have crossed the finish line with.
extrapolate backward and you get the group who would have been in the area where he fell.
according to the race splits, these three runners were with Reid at the 10k, half- marathon, and 20k marks.
interestingly enough, this one here-- Michael Gibson-- was involved in a lawsuit against Reid.
something about a bad $40 million investment.
seems like Owen Reid gave this Michael Gibson a serious run for his money.
and a motive murder.
Mr. Gibson, we're looking into the death of a colleague of yours in the marathon yesterday.
Yeah, I heard it, uh, it might have been a heart attack.
you don't seem upset.
well, everyone knows the risks of running a marathon.
hmm, last man standing sort of thing?
something like.
you wouldn't have happened to help him fall, perhaps?
county.
I wouldn't need to cheat to beat Owen Reid, no.
we found traces of Vaseline on Mr. Reid's back a handprint with streaks of blood in it.
is that going to be your blood?
I don't know. Should it be?
we have photos of the finish line.
you had blood on your shirt when you crossed.
when you run, various parts of your body chafe enough to bleed.
so we use Vaseline.
it helps a lot.
Owen was fading, so I gave him a slap on the back as I took off.
just a friendly slap?
no, there was nothing friendly about it.
I was going to beat his ass.
he's dead, Mr. Gibson.
his lawsuit isn't.
being dead, it's not going to stop him.
it might slow him down a little, but that's about it.
why don't you just quit while you're ahead?
you got enough blood on your hands already.
we'll need a DNA sample.
Yeah.
I thought you might.
why don't we get his prints as well?
seeing as Mr. Gibson here is in such a giving mood.
Yeah.
Colin's prints came back negative.
so is he off the hook?
blood still puts him at the scene.
so what else do we get?
do you want to go get some lunch?
Danny, Mac wants us to wrap this up.
sure, but he doesn't want us to starve to death.
what else did Adam say?
what do you mean?
I mean, that's who you were talking to, right?
Yeah, but what makes you think he said anything else?
I just want to go get something to eat.
all right.
the gum you found?
he matched it to the dental impressions from the victim.
nothing.
the DNA and teeth impressions both negative?
negative.
I'm gonna go back and look at the gum.
no, no, no, no, Adam, Adam looked at the gum.
I just want to grab a slice.
I'm starving here.
where am I?
we need to connect someone to this nozzle.
somebody had to see something.
Owen Reid was lying almost directly on top of this sign.
but it was found 50 yards down the road from the nozzle.
it couldn't belong to the killer.
maybe it could lead us to a witness.
now...
none of these footprints have enough individualizing characteristics to be unique.
but...
take a look at this.
a bicycle, maybe?
or a stroller.
some people like to run with their kids.
but this tread pattern is too narrow to be a stroller.
it's a wheelchair.
still have those results?
Yeah.
okay.
according to this, Owen was on track to finish the race in three hours and 20 minutes.
only one wheelchair finished in that time.
looks like I found my witness.
I checked your stats, you ranked in your age group.
you've only been racing for five years.
that's how long I've been at a chair.
I wasn't born like this.
guy jumped a median on the belt parkway and pow, didn't even see it coming.
he walked away from it, and I haven't walked since.
you said on the phone you had some questions about Owen Reid.
you knew him?
I read the papers.
did you see anything?
I saw him go down.
I just thought maybe he slipped, on those paper cups.
what happened to your hands?
just before that guy fell I crashed as well.
someone got in my way and I went down hard.
that's the repair I'm doing.
so you didn't see anything at all?
one of the disadvantages of being in a wheelchair, you don't see things the way you used to.
they look different.
well, thank you, Mr. Keith.
if I have any further questions, I'll be in touch.
the fish eggs are from masago.
smelts.
widely used as a garnish for sushi.
popular and cheap.
so no immediate source that links to our suspect.
well, not unless Owen Reid stopped at Norimaku while he was running up first avenue.
hey guys, you can come here for a second?
I talked to Richard Keith.
not a lot of help, so I decided take another look at that nozzle.
you already checked for prints.
well, given the blank we're drawing with Mr. Gibson,
I figured it was good for another go-round.
all right, remember these indentations?
what am I looking at?
I think they're animal bite marks.
and that which bites leaves saliva.
exactly.
and the mystery animal is?
Felis lybica sarda.
a Sicilian wild cat.
it's illegal to own because of its protected status.
but as in all things illegal - there are people that just have to have one.
Yeah, several people have been fined in the last 12 months for having one in their possession.
our only link to a suspect is a cat's DNA?
a cat that's owned by a person.
and you have a list of people.
as a matter of fact, I do.
my landlord and me, we had an agreement.
it's still illegal to keep those animals in the city.
I had Psycho for six years.
ever since I came from Sacramento.
all of a sudden there's this law.
I didn't even know.
where is Psycho now?
not in the tree, he died four days ago.
I buried him down there.
what happened?
ate rat poison.
someone in the building had a thing against cats-- you, uh, you know how many sickos there are in this town?
your vet told you it was rat poison?
he said it was cyanide.
Heather, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to examine Psycho.
you want to dig him up?
I'm sorry.
is there any dignity left?
what do you got?
the gum we found at the crime scene was bubble gum but it had traces of spearmint and nicotine.
one of the waitresses was smoking before I talked to her and then she did a pop of that breath freshener.
she said she wasn't in the basement, though.
well her breath tells a different story.
so you told the detective that you didn't go down into the basement.
that's right.
I was up here working the party.
and did you go onto the stage after Tonya came up?
no.
look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I have proof you were on the platform where Tonya was killed.
I wasn't there, I told you.
your gum, Jennifer.
you left it behind.
okay.
look, I only went down there to sit on the throne.
feel what it was like to be in the winner's seat for a change.
and did Tonya see you?
she came out of her little dressing room.
caught me sitting there.
you have to earn that seat.
I earned it.
sure...
on your back.
what did you say?
you heard me.
you little bitch!
then I went back upstairs.
is this your costume?
Yeah.
did you go into Tonya's dressing room?
no.
Maybe...I don't know.
I'm going to need your prints.
I was wearing gloves.
how's that going to prove anything?
you were there, so I need your prints.
look, I told you what happened.
my dad's an attorney.
you want my prints, you talk to him.
believe me, I will.
you got a C. O. D. On Psycho yet?
two guesses.
no...
one.
carbon monoxide?
somebody told you.
so why the teeth marks on the nozzle?
did the cat bite the canister used to kill Owen Reid?
or maybe the cat was gassed as a test.
can't rule it out, I guess.
anything else?
Yeah, I found this under one of the cat's claws.
material?
some kind of nylon.
let me take a look at this.
I know where this came from.
I'm sorry, you caught me at work.
you were contacted by a detective earlier today.
about the marathon.
I volunteer every year.
you mind if I sit?
that's the repair I'm doing.
that's a nasty bruise.
Yeah, it's one of the perils of volunteering.
35, 000 runners coming by-- it's hard to avoid them all.
a runner did that?
a runner fell near the aid station. You were working at.
I heard that.
I didn't see it happen, but as you said I was nearby.
it's unforgivable when an athlete's injured.
your upstairs neighbor's cat died.
And?
these tears in your screen make us think that it tried to get into your apartment.
so you think I killed it?
would you mind if I looked around?
well, I'm actually in the middle of a shoot.
but okay.
I mean, please try not to disturb anything.
I see your studio is wheelchair accessible.
that's the law for businesses, no?
I thought you'd approve.
what's this used for?
carbon monoxide-- it brightens the food for the camera.
it's the missing canister.
did you shoot this sushi recently?
day before yesterday.
Why?
you left eggs at central park.
on Owen Reid's body.
I got your message.
you don't like Jennifer for the killing, so I thought I'd take another look at these here.
it just doesn't add up.
Jennifer weighs 110 dripping wet.
there's no way she could have thrust that ice scepter with that much force.
I'm getting her prints anyway.
just tying up loose ends.
so what do you have here?
this one's odd.
the rest of these are common feather but this one comes from a rare jungle bird in central India.
it's called a jungle cock eye.
you know what, at this magnitude the feather should look dull.
see how it's kind of glassy?
Synthetic?
fishermen use these kinds of feathers to make flies.
what do you got?
Euglena.
it's freshwater organism.
this feather was used recently.
who's our fly fisherman?
I was visiting my parents up at Beaverkill.
Tonya's boyfriend said he was up in Beaverkill.
that's up in the Catskills. Freshwater.
trout fishing central.
well, I think we just got a bite.
like I told you earlier, I was never in the basement.
I barely even made it to the party.
Where'd you say you were?
I was upstate-- my parent's place.
that's right, upstate.
you do some fishing up there?
Yeah, sure.
make your own flies?
that was a question.
why don't you just tell us what happened in the basement.
I was never in the basement.
do me a favor now-- don't get yourself in a situation where you're going to tell one lie to explain another lie, all right?
it's just a bad strategy, man.
this got on your clothes when you were changing in your car.
then when you went downstairs that feather fell on the floor.
there were tons of people with feathers on them at that party.
not this particular feather, though.
and when we asked to examine your suit, remember that?
yeah?
we were looking for grease from the hydraulic lift in the basement in the club.
well, guess what?
we found some.
that gives us probable cause to arrest you and take your prints.
which we're thinking are going to match the prints that we found on the murder weapon.
we went out since high school.
we even went to the same college so we could be together.
go on.
almost as soon as we got here, she started talking about needing space, and we should take our time.
said she was waitressing.
till dawn some nights.
she'd come home drunk.
so I followed her to work one day, cause I knew, i knew she was lying.
she was dancing.
a dancer.
we had a huge fight.
she couldn't trust me.
I was suffocating her.
the Buri vodka thing came up, she quit dancing.
everything felt better.
we were talking about getting married.
I went upstate to tell my mom and dad, and then, I get this phone call.
I just thought you'd want to know that your girlfriend is sleeping with the vodka man.
I got back in, like, three hours.
went to the club, went downstairs.
we're done, finished.
I'm moving out.
I have to go.
Tonya, please.
I love you.
we've been done for years.
every time we break up, you just stand there with that look on your face.
Yeah, that look.
what are you doing?
I was just so mad.
love run cold.
that'll do it.
Lindsay Monroe, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
I have to know what's going on with you.
look, I mean, you and I-- we have this-this thing, right?
this chemistry, like we're into each other?
but every time we're in the same room together today, it's like...
don't tell me you don't feel it, also.
I can't do this, Danny.
you can't do what?
I can't be in relationship with you.
all right, I don't...
I don't...
um, I just...
I'm talking about spending some time together.
dinner, a few drinks.
some laughs.
I like you.
a lot.
but right now, I can't.
it's not you, okay?
it's...
I just...
I need to be by myself so I can work some stuff out that I thought I had put behind me.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
it's okay.
maybe we should just do our jobs.
if there's anything you need from me, just let me know, okay?
your sister's in trouble, Richard.
ms. Cates, we know you killed Owen Reid.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was handing out water.
you handed out more than water.
you waited till he got to the aid station, and then you poisoned him with this.
I found his skin on this canister from your apartment.
the canister was so cold, he left a piece behind.
I think I know why you did it.
that racer who crashed into you, Richard Keith as luck would have it, he was your brother, who nearly died from an accident caused by Mr. Reid.
you still go by your married name, which is why the connection wasn't obvious.
the DA says unless you confess your involvement, there will be no plea bargain for your sister.
that means life.
richard normally finishes at the top of his age group, but yesterday, he was a full two hours behind.
see, I think he was trailing Reid.
he'd let you know he was coming.
richard had nothing to do with it.
how did he communicate to you that Reid was approaching your aid station?
did he page you from a pay-as-you-go cell phone so we wouldn't be unable to trace it?
the fact that he crashed into me isn't connected to Reid's death.
we know about the settlement Reid negotiated, and how he didn't live up to it.
you took him to court and you still didn't get anything.
I can see how angry that would make you, Sharon.
look, I would be angry, too.
you know when I was hurt, she was more devastated than me.
I figured I could recover, but she never did.
you have no idea.
richard was an all-American runner.
ranked third in the country coming out of high-school.
olympic qualifier in '96. His best marathon time was 2: 26 in Boston.
0.00168981481481
then that animal...
Owen Reid was drunk and he took my brother's life away.
he took his legs away, Sharon, not his life.
whatever agreement you have with Sharon, you owe it to her to accept responsibility.
she made me promise.
she'll tell you everything you need to know.
my brother's already in prison; what he goes through every day.
I killed Owen Reid in revenge for what he did to my brother.
Richard's innocent.
he had nothing to do with the death of Owen Reid, and I have nothing else to say.
please don't let go of me.
no...
don't drop me, please...
no...
beautiful!
Hey, you there!
that's right!
Mandi, over the shoulder.
okay, great.
Mandi, love, I need you to turn to camera for me when you hit that ball, okay?
then move the camera, Tony.
I'm not a contortionist.
finally, I called about these pillows two hours ago.
could you set those lights up for me over there?
Thanks.
what is this thing made of?
buckwheat hulls, they conform to the head and neck for maximum...
it's lumpy.
well, this is our gelly neck roll pillow.
it's therapeutic moldable gel...
this is it?
this is all you have?
I just flew in from Milan.
is it too much to ask for a decent pillow?
Hello!
I asked you a question.
Mandi, uh, I need to touch up your makeup.
get out of my face, Tess.
I was just trying to help.
thank you for your concern.
I'll call you as soon as I'm ready for a touch up.
and as for you...
call me when she's done. - Okay.
I said, is it too much to ask for a decent pillow?
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster.
I'll check the pillow menu.
I'm sure I'll find something that you'll like.
somehow, I'm not in the mood for volleyball anymore.
I'm going to my room.
all right, everybody take five.
don't drop me, please.
Where's Mandi?
please.
right here.
sir, stop that.
please excuse me-- Ladies, excuse me.
they were shooting a swimwear ad on the rooftop lounge.
Mandi Foster found the body.
is our vic a model, too?
hotel concierge.
Sara Jackson, 20 years old.
moved here from Minnesota two years ago.
based on the trajectory...
I'd say this wasn't an accident.
open and Shut
I got a partial print off the fingernail.
possible defensive wounds on her arms.
I want this section of the railing to go back to the lab.
have Adam check it out.
what about the vic?
remove the body with the spike intact.
that was a gunshot.
sounds close.
Danny, stay here.
hold the crime scene.
10-13, shots fired next door to the soho regency.
send some backup, we're on our way.
I got two down over here.
we got two down.
I need a bus and put a rush on it.
copy that. We'll notify.
is there anyone else here, ma'am?
I'm gonna pick up the gun, okay?
he was hitting my husband in the head with a hammer.
he just kept hitting...
I didn't know what else to do.
I shot him.
are you hurt?
I don't think so.
I'm detective Bonasera.
that's my...
my husband, Dan.
cancel the rush on the bus.
we got two DOAs.
do you know who this man is?
I've never seen him before.
do you have any idea how he got in here?
I was upstairs getting out of the shower and I heard this strange sound.
I saw...
that man hitting my husband with his hammer.
and I didn't know what else to do.
so I...I shot him.
grace, why don't we go outside, okay?
no, I can't leave him.
no. He's lying here on the floor...
no.
we'll take good care of him, ma'am.
let go.
let go.
careful.
I want this case.
I'm a therapist.
I counsel trauma patients and look at me, I can't even think straight.
you've been through something that most people don't experience in a lifetime.
it happened in my own home.
you're supposed to be safe in your own home.
do you own the gun?
my husband.
what about the hammer?
it was ours.
before I got in the shower, dan said he was going to hang this...
clock that we got online.
do you have any friends in the city?
anywhere you can stay?
my sister.
I'd like to go upstairs and collect a couple of things.
I'm sorry, Grace.
I can't let you go back in there.
it's a crime scene now, okay.
I understand.
you think I'll be arrested for killing that man?
it's not my place to say.
but the da doesn't usually prosecute in self defense cases.
there's one you don't see every day.
betcha kind of wish you were still in the M. E.'S office, don't you?
no, I can safely say the thrill is gone.
all right, we have two crime scenes.
we got one in the hotel here, the other in the apartment building next door.
I think it was a full moon last night.
any way the two crimes could be related?
they don't appear to be.
okay, you two hook up with Stella.
Danny's gonna work the hotel with me.
husband sustained blunt force trauma to the head consistent with hammer blows.
I count...
one, two...
three circular skull fractures.
our attacker took two rounds to the back of the skull.
one's a through and through.
there's also something written on his hand.
257 Morton.
10: 00 A. M.
that's this address.
why would he write the time and address if he was coming here to kill them?
that sounds more like an appointment.
an appointment for murder.
the spike penetrated the chest wall and perforated the aortic arch.
a couple of centimeters to the right, she might've pulled through.
when I was an intern, they brought in a guy who'd fallen from a loading dock onto a container of steel reinforcement rods.
talk about a 1, 000 points of light - Now, Sid,
I'm sure that's all fascinating, but I'm kind of jammed up here today.
why...
why'd you leave this on?
Oh, yeah, look at this.
cartier came out with these bracelets in the '70s.
they're supposed to represent enduring love.
only way to remove it is with a special screwdriver which is kept by the giver of the gift.
of course, I could've cut it off, but i couldn't bring myself to damage such a sentimental part of the victim's life.
what about these gouges here?
uh, fingernail marks.
I collected some kind of oily substance from the wound tracts.
her vaginal sample tested positive for seminal fluid and I also found some hairs on her inner thigh.
they're not hers.
so we have her bracelet, fingernail marks, sexual activity and foreign hairs.
add it all up...
could be looking at a lovers' quarrel.
a lovers' quarrel.
what were you up to, Sara Jackson?
Oh, man this oily substance it found, not only do I not know what kind of cell it is,
I don't even think it's human.
I'm having the same problem with the hair.
microscopic characteristics are sometimes hard to nail down.
just keep at it.
camel hair.
camel hair?
what are camel hairs doing on our vic's thigh?
I use that brush in my work.
we found camel hairs on Sara Jackson's body.
and evidence of recent sexual activity.
we'd like a reference sample of your DNA.
what, so you can stick it on some government database?
no way.
I know my rights.
we have rights too.
they're called warrants.
okay, so I partied with her last night.
sex is not a crime.
no, it's not.
however, several witnesses say that you left the roof lounge the same time as the victim.
Yeah, so what'd you do?
wait for her in the atrium?
I came back here to my room.
when these supermodels pitch a fit, it can be three, four hours of down time.
easy.
that's enough time for another round of fun and games with Sara.
Yeah.
so what happened?
you make a play for her she shut you down?
bruise your ego?
let's go back to my room.
no, no, just let go of me.
the only reason I was even with that girl 'cause I was doing Mandi a favor.
having sex with the hotel concierge was a favor?
look, Mandi introduced us.
she told me Sara was an aspiring model.
and asked if I'd take her headshots.
Mandi and Sara were friends?
I don't know what their deal was.
I just take the pictures.
we're going to need some fingerprints to go along with that DNA.
our hammer man's name is Ron Blunt.
he's already in the system.
for what?
indecent exposure.
he took a bath in the Lincoln center fountain last year.
any history of drugs?
tox screen showed traces of an anti-psychotic called risperidone.
all right, maybe he went off his meds and had a meltdown.
we found out that his name is Ron Blunt.
does that name ring a bell?
he's the limo driver.
he drove my husband home from the airport a few weeks ago.
something happened?
he told Dan that he could speak to spirits and fly above the trees.
he started driving erratically, and refused to stop the car.
Dan, I really think you should report this to the police.
it won't do any good.
they're just going to rubber stamp it.
well, you have to do something.
the behavior that you described me indicates paranoid schizophrenia.
he needs help.
I called the limo company and told them that one of their drivers was potentially dangerous.
and that he needed a psych evaluation.
and did they follow through?
well, I don't know if he ever got treatment, but I'm pretty sure that he...
was dismissed.
I should've listened to Dan.
I should've just left it alone.
this is...
this is all my fault.
no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.
um, I was wondering when I could get back into my apartment?
it's kind of hard living out of a tote bag.
well, we're still processing the scene but even if we weren't...
grace, I know you think you're ready to go back in there.
but you need to give yourself some time.
now, I would be happy to send someone back to your home to get a few things if you'd like.
you just let me know.
my home?
when I close my eyes I can still see...
the blood all over the kitchen.
and Dan lying there on the...
floor.
Hey.
prints from the hammer.
some were smeared, but I did get a partial from Ron Blunt and a set from the victim.
Thomason's prints are on the hammer because he owned it.
which means that Ron Blunt came to the scene without a weapon.
so the murder wasn't premeditated.
I'm surprised you're jumping to that conclusion, Lindsay.
just because he didn't bring a weapon doesn't mean he didn't have intent.
well, so far, we don't have anything that says he came to the scene with the intent to kill.
well, we have blunt's background check.
not only does he have a history of psychiatric problems, he was fired three days before the murder.
that sounds like a revenge killing to me.
well, what about the flowers?
here's his autopsy report.
Peyton found traces of pollen on his hand.
I fumed the wrapping from the flowers and his prints were all over it.
well, maybe he used the flowers to get into the apartment.
I mean, looking through a peep hole and seeing a bouquet of flowers isn't exactly threatening.
true but Dan Thomason knows what he looked like, so he wouldn't of just let him in.
well, he must've.
there were no signs of forced entry-- Blunt didn't break in.
you know, maybe we're looking at this the wrong way, Stella. Maybe Thomason got scared when he saw Blunt at the door, despite the fact that the flowers are just what they appear to be-- a peace offering, his way of saying he was sorry for the whole limo thing.
okay. He came to apologize, found it unsatisfying and took it to the next level.
Hey, I'm...
I'm just doing what you taught me.
I'm just asking the tough questions.
but you're looking at a schizophrenic and expecting rational answers.
the only two people who know exactly what happened in that room are dead, Lindsay.
it's our job to collect the evidence and examine it.
and the sooner we do that, the sooner we can all move on.
we're fine.
I spoke with grace Thomason.
she's blaming herself.
common reaction.
you know, we go to crime scenes and we start rattling off platitudes to people.
words of pain and loss and healing.
and the truth is, all we really about is the business of death.
I know this has to be a little tough on you, Stella.
Yeah.
actually, I think it's good.
it's bringing out stuff that I haven't dealt with.
Yeah, I look at grace and...
I know what she's going through.
that's our very first case together.
I remember the look in your eyes at the end of each day, when you processed the crime scene and analyzed her clothes.
I'm going to tell you now what I told you then:
it's hard to separate yourself emotionally, but in the end, always comes down to the evidence.
I didn't forgot that, Mac.
this case is different.
well, I'm different.
I know what it's like to be trapped in your home.
and I have a vivid memory of that horrible moment when you realize the only way out is a bullet.
I have no choice but to be emotionally involved.
you got anything on the railing?
that's a joke, right?
call it wishful thinking.
it's got more trace on it than a public rest room.
actually, I have no idea what I'm looking for here.
well, sometimes you don't know what you're looking for until you find it-- thank you.
our photographer's prints didn't match the print we found on the vic.
we got a hit on someone else.
see if you can put it on the railing.
Mandi Foster, oh.
uh, I love Mandi Foster.
you were picked up three years ago for assaulting your assistant with an ipod.
police report said it wasn't the first time.
I tossed her my iPod.
it accidentally hit her in the head.
that's the truth.
I was there.
she sold her story to the tabloids for 50 grand.
bought a tanning salon with it.
you're the stylist, right?
Tess Larson? Yeah?
we don't need to talk to you right now.
could you leave us alone, please?
Tessie, how about some water?
Volvic, room temp.
Thanks, Tess.
we found your fingerprints on Sara Jackson.
I must have touched her when I found the body.
I remember checking for a pulse.
on her fingertip?
what can I say?
I've never seen a dead person before.
I was freaking out.
we have a witness who says that you knew the victim and that you arranged for her to get headshots.
deluca, that idiot.
we'll take that as a yes.
I met Sara here at the hotel.
we talked a little. She said she wanted to be a model.
I tried to help her.
end of story.
and you did all of this out of the goodness of your heart?
Yeah, that's right.
models have hearts, too, you know.
when Blunt attacked Thomason with the hammer, he should've ended up with some medium-velocity blood spatter on his shirt.
I can't find any.
any spatter could've been covered when he fell into the blood pool.
Yeah, well, let's spray it with luminol.
maybe we're just not seeing it.
Hawkes, I need you to take a look at something.
okay.
brain tissue.
from the blood i collected in the bathroom.
it's Dan Thomason's DNA.
so how did Dan Thomason's brain matter end up on the bathtub?
I don't know.
I mean, there was no blood trail leading in that direction, at least none that we could see.
there's also a possible inconsistency with the spatter on Blunt's shirt.
looks like we've got some unanswered questions.
then let's answer them.
so I finally I. D. that substance we found in Sara's arm wounds.
bovine stem cells.
cow stem cells.
those are used in medical research.
as far as I know, that's all they're used for, but I'll keep looking.
Hey.
so I went down to the deli to get a cinnamon twist, ran into a friend of ours.
paparazzi must've been hiding behind a potted plant.
I don't know.
the angle's pretty low, and look at this bracelet.
it belongs to Sara Jackson.
so she took this photo?
there's just one problem with your theory.
that was the editor of entertainment worldwide.
the photo came from a digital video which was uploaded to their web site two hours after Sara's murder.
get a subpoena for the video.
whoever took it could be our killer.
all right, according to Grace Thomason's statement, Blunt was standing about two feet behind her husband.
just about here.
ready?
Yep.
okay, here we go.
medium-velocity blood spatter.
Thomason went down with his head right about there.
his arm was bent and his feet were over there.
all right, you ready, hammer man?
okay, concentrated blood pattern on the chest and the blood pool.
medium-velocity blood spatter on the neck, shoulder, and arms.
there should have been a similar pattern on the shirt that Blunt was wearing.
and the fact that there wasn't suggests that Blunt didn't wield the hammer.
what else do we have?
okay, let's check the gravitational drops.
bring the hammer down.
no match.
lower it again.
still no match.
lower it again.
we have a match in stain size.
one foot, eight inches.
okay, adjusting for arm length.
whoever held the hammer was between 5'2" and 5'5."
Ron Blunt is six feet.
you wanted to see me, Sid?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
uh, glove up.
you're gonna want to check this out.
when Sara Jackson's body went into rigor, something interesting happened.
what?
look.
check her right hand.
it's not in rigor like the rest of her body.
muscle exertion at the time of death caused her hand to go into early rigor.
that would only happen if she was clutching something when she died.
we didn't find anything at the scene.
maybe someone pried her hand open and took it out.
once the rigor was broken, it didn't return.
right.
you're looking for an object that would have fit in the palm of her hand.
Sara was holding a camera when she died, wasn't she?
how should I know?
because you cracked open her hand and took it out.
leaving your fingerprints behind.
whatever.
why do you guys keep harassing me?
we tend to do that when we think someone is guilty of murder.
this doesn't make sense.
why would I kill her?
because you found out she was videotaping you.
you got angry, told her to give you the camera.
when she didn't give you the camera, you had one of your outbursts.
only this time, things got really out of hand.
give me the camera.
no.
give me the camera.
give me the camera, Sara!
No!
let go!
okay, I admit I took the camera, but I'd been through a traumatic experience.
I think you guys are forgetting that I'm the victim here.
Really?
I don't think Sara Jackson's family would see it that way.
I'm really sad about what happened to Sara, but she was already dead when I found her.
What'd you do with the camera?
I got rid of it.
where?
why does it matter?
it's evidence.
well, it's in the Hudson now.
if you threw the camera in the river, how'd the photos end up in entertainment worldwide?
you sent them, didn't you?
it was a business thing.
what kind of business thing?
Sara was supposed to videotape me, leak it to the press, and in return, I was supposed to get my photographer to take head shots of her.
I don't know what went wrong.
so you're telling me this whole thing was a publicity stunt?
look at Kate Moss.
she's gotten over nine international covers since she was videotaped doing coke.
stand up.
what are you doing?
we have enough evidence to charge you on probable cause.
but I told you I didn't do anything.
you were at the scene of a homicide, you took the camera out of the victim's hand.
look at it this way, Kitten.
it's free publicity.
son of a bitch.
grace planned this whole thing.
there's Sara.
looks like her camera had some kind of clip-on attachment like a cell phone.
here's the cover shot.
that looks...
that's the Thomasons' apartment in the background.
Where'd you get this?
Sara Jackson took it on the roof yesterday, before she died.
so it looks like Mandi was on the up-and-up about the videotaping.
still doesn't mean she's innocent.
Hey, what time was this video taken?
around 9: 35.
so you'll never guess what bovine stem cells are used for these days.
facials.
Oh, that's a new one.
Yeah, apparently it reverses the aging process.
only a couple places in Manhattan do it.
lucky for us, one of them is the soho regency spa.
was Mandi Foster on their client list?
along with her stylist and her agent and about seven other hotel guests.
well, now all we got to do is narrow it down.
boom.
the blue markers represent your biologicals.
baby spit-up, semen, e coli bacteria, saliva...
not all from the same person, I hope.
according to the dna results-- ding, ding, ding!
you are correct.
what are the yellow markers?
uh, consumer goods.
juicy fruit gum, eyebrow pencil, pomegranate juice.
that's a great antioxidant.
next, you got your reds.
metals and minerals.
copper, brass, gold, 14-karat, 18-karat.
there was a mix of turquoise and silver.
wait.
turquoise and silver?
uh, yeah.
Tessie, how about some water?
Volvic. Room temp.
I need to see that turquoise and silver trace.
it's right down...
down...
it's right here.
scratches have a forward directionality.
imprint is pretty deep.
minute amount of silver trace actually embedded in the wood.
would take a lot of pressure to do that.
someone...
leaning over the railing...
holding something heavy.
Yeah.
how much did the victim weigh?
uh, 115.
what are you talking about?
you pushed Sara over the balcony in the atrium, and then you tried to save her.
I wasn't anywhere near that atrium.
when you leaned over the railing to grab Sara, your navel ring imprinted on the railing, leaving microscopic amounts of turquoise and silver.
we were able to simulate the conditions and get the same results.
tons of people wear navel rings.
how many of them also had a bovine facial in the hotel spa?
what does that have to do with this?
everything.
we found bovine stem cells in the wounds on Sara Jackson's arms, transferred from your nails.
you were the only hotel guest who had both a bovine facial and vip access to the rooftop floor.
so you want to tell me what happened?
I've been with Mandi since the beginning.
she gave me my start.
I just wanted to protect her.
from what?
the paparazzi, the tabloids. They're...
waiting for her to screw up.
they're just...
they're like sharks circling, they're everywhere.
Tess, Mandi planned this whole thing.
it was her idea.
what do you mean?
Mandi arranged for Sara to videotape her on the roof for publicity.
it was all for the publicity.
no.
that's not true.
can't be true. I just...
is it too much to ask for a decent pillow?
I asked you a question!
Mandi, I need to touch up your makeup.
get out of my face, Tess.
I said...
hey...
I saw what you were doing.
give me the camera!
No!
give it to me!
No! You don't know what you're doing!
you can't do this!
let go of me!
No!
please...
please don't let go of me!
help me, please...
no, don't drop me!
I just wanted the camera.
I just needed to get the camera from her.
I didn't want to kill her.
the evidence we got from the crime scene reenactment was damning, but inconclusive.
so I had to go back to the only real solid evidence we have.
the brain cells from the blood in the bathroom.
I couldn't figure out how they got in there.
and then it hit me.
grace didn't take a shower before her husband was killed, she took one afterwards.
so you're saying Grace killed her husband, took a shower and then shot Ron Blunt?
mac Grace planned the whole thing down to the last detail.
and this is proof.
I enhanced the video that Sara Jackson took from the roof.
okay?
see, I think Grace had already bludgeoned her husband at this point.
notice she's wearing a white T-shirt, and her hair is dry.
so she hasn't taken a shower yet.
right.
now she's heading to the bathroom here.
probably to take that shower.
when she took off the bloody T-shirt, a drop of the blood containing her husband's brain matter must've fallen onto the bathtub.
so this is all happening right before we arrived at the hotel for the Jackson murder?
exactly.
see, I checked the police report, and we entered the Thomasons' apartment at exactly 9: 50.
that's 15 minutes after this video was taken.
grace had wet hair and she was wearing a pink shirt, remember?
the question is, where's that white T-shirt?
she could've tossed it.
there's an incinerator shaft in the hall.
no, I don't think she had enough time to go out in the hallway.
see, Ron Blunt had "10: 00 A. M." Written on his hand.
when we got there at ten to 10: 00, he was already dead.
he must've arrived early.
so she had enough time to change her shirt, but not dispose of it.
and there was no opportunity after she shot Blunt because we were on the scene within seconds.
that's why she was so anxious to get back into the apartment.
I'd like to go up to Sara's and collect a couple of things.
I was wondering when I could get back into my apartment.
to dispose of that T-shirt.
framing a man with known mental problems was very clever.
but then again, you're a therapist; you'd know who to pick.
I really have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, see, now, that's a click?
I would've expected something far more imaginative from you.
okay, that's just being passive-aggressive.
you had it all planned down to the last detail, didn't you, grace?
see, the only thing you couldn't have known is that we were seconds away on another case.
you know, I just buried my husband.
why are you doing this to me?
Ron Blunt's funeral is tomorrow.
see, I doubt anybody will be there, because the press has painted him as a depraved murderer.
because that's exactly what he is.
now, that's projecting.
you're the one who brought that poor man to your apartment.
I mean, what did you say to him?
that you would help him get his job back?
well, you tell me.
I'm sure you have a theory.
well, he brought you flowers.
I'm sure he was just trying to make a good impression.
and then, you led him into the kitchen where the body of your bludgeoned husband lay.
and you shot him in the back of the head.
and then you put the hammer in his hand, so his prints would be on it.
I suppose you have evidence to back up this outrageous accusation.
I found your little white T-shirt, shoved in the vent in your bedroom.
that's why you wanted to get back into your apartment.
wanted to get rid of all that stuff.
how am I doing so far?
you didn't have to live with him.
maybe not.
but murder isn't the solution.
isn't that a bit hypocritical?
I mean, coming from you.
excuse me?
Yeah, I read somewhere that you shot your boyfriend three times in the chest, point blank range, in own your apartment.
was last year, wasn't it?
that was self-defense.
I was a victim, and you're a cold-blooded murderer.
announcer Final boarding call for Flight 401 to New York's JFK Airport.
all passengers should be onboard at this time.
new York.
looks like someone's going to miss you.
enjoy your flight.
thank you.
pilot: Folks, we'll be circling over Manhattan for a few minutes...
detective Taylor, there's an urgent call for you.
if you'll just follow me...
thank you.
detective Taylor.
FLACK: Hey, Mac, we got a crime scene at the Statue of Liberty.
there'll be a helicopter on the tarmac waiting for you.
welcome back to the land of the free and the home of the depraved.
you didn't actually think we'd let you settled, did you?
any clue what this is about?
got a lot of guesses, but nothing's confirmed.
lady Liberty isn't our only victim.
TAYLOR: What do we got, Sheldon?
georgia Morrison. Liberty Island Security.
current theory is that our security guard interrupts the act of vandalism, a fight breaks out.
vandal wins the fight.

cause of death is exsanguination.
TAYLOR: You find her gun?
not yet. I just got word that there's a male security guard unaccounted for.
guy by the name of Charles Price.
he was on duty last night.
any evidence he was up here?
Stella might have the answer to that question.
so what are we looking at, Detective?
evidence of sexual activity.
nothing's sacred anymore.
who would do something like this?
someone desperate to get his message across.
what's the verdict?
Oh!
welcome to the party, Mac.
what do we have, Danny?
uh, there are 12 different samples, all of them blood.
but there's way too much out here to be from the vic.
hers is all on the floor inside.
send it back to the lab, let's see if it's human.
Yeah, right away.
directionality of the spatter is consistent with arterial spray.
except for these two isolated blood drops here.
well, maybe our killer was injured.
Yeah, it's possible.
except there's no blood trail that leads out of here.
looks like these two drops took a right turn.
how many do you have?
MESSER: A dozen overlapping fingerprints in the Plexiglas.
I'm gonna have them sent over to the lab along with the blood samples I collected from the face of the statue and trace evidence from our vic.
did you say blood?
the news is reporting that it's paint.
we're dealing with a serious psychopath.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I just hope it's not human blood.
tell Adam to drop everything.
this is top priority.
he's not here.
I'll find him.
I'll see you back at the lab.
Hi, I'm calling from the Office of Unemployment.
Oh, Lindsay, hey.
word is that Denny's is looking to hire some socially awkward scientists.
I - I'm halfway there already. Okay?
it's a big case, Adam.
it's the Statue of Liberty, it's all over the news.
we've got a lot of work to do.
this is top priority, and Mac's back in town.

Yeah. Just...

I'll be fine.
london was good?
Peyton's happy? Perfect.
it was nice meeting her family.
she's staying in London a few more weeks.
I got a few strange phone calls my hotel room phone.
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
couple of seconds of dead silence, then they'd hang up.
wrong number?
each call came at exactly 3: 33 a. m.
Hello?
who is this?
wasn't sure what to make of it, so I switched hotels.
I got three more calls at the new hotel, all at 3: 33.
who is this?
say something, damn it.
scotland Yard tried to trace the calls.
got nowhere.
FLACK: There's no witness.
and no surveillance.
cause after 9/11 we all know that a $36 million security system was installed on this island.
here's the kicker: once every three months, they shut down for system upgrades and reboots.
takes 45 minutes.
small window of opportunity.
no one's that lucky.
just the same, I got uniforms compiling a list of all personnel as well as any maintenance and electrical crews that have access to the island.
but here's the good news:
bomb squad did a search of the perimeter and the statue, it's all clean.
so we're not looking at a terrorist threat.
policeman: Detectives.
BONASERA: There's blood on the coin slot.
Yeah, I always like to do a little sightseeing after I commit murder.
this wire is holding the viewfinder in place.
maybe we're the ones who are supposed to do the sightseeing.
there's a man on a rooftop.
it's him.
what?
he's watching us.
FLACK: All right, listen up.
we got an unknown male, possibly our suspect, on a roof across the river.
now I need aviation to the tip of Battery Park immediately.
and I want all available units heading towards Whitehall Street.
standby for exact location.
this guy hasn't moved an inch.
Flack, cancel the squad cars.
send for the coroner.
this guy's dead.
this guy isn't our missing security guard.
so Charles Price is still in the wind.
then who is he?
and what connection does he have to Georgia Morrison?
I don't know, but our killer wanted us to find him.
am I crazy, or is he orange?
he was definitely injected with some kind of orange substance, but...
that is not a needle mark.
got another one over here.
I'm not looking at a gunshot wound.
these holes are inconsistent with a through and through.
2 more will die.
HAMMERBACK: I printed your vic.
his name is Damion Brock, on parole for money laundering.
I'll start with the orange substance.
the two holes in his neck are indicative of the embalming process.
two catheters are inserted into the neck and the embalming fluid is pumped into the system as the blood is drained out.
he was embalmed?
in a sense, only instead of embalming fluid, your killer used a household cleaning fluid.
orange spruce-scented, to be precise.
there is something else.
I recovered this from the victim's throat.
before you ask, I have no idea what it is.
there are tiny, Braille-like bumps on the surface.
now, if you'll look closely, there is a hairline fracture to the skull here.
but not enough damage to kill him.
so you're still looking for C. O.D.
as well as time of death.
I did take a buccal swab and compared it to Danny's samples from the scene. It's a match to the blood found on the Statue of Liberty.
which means he's most likely our first victim.
Mm-hmm. Blood was drained and poured over the statue.
our second victim, "Two more will die." That means there's a third victim.
missing security guard?
not if he's our killer.
do I get a hint?
can we play 20 Questions?
it's neither animal nor vegetable.
actually, it was shoved down our vic's throat, so it has to have some significance.
the bumps aren't Braille.
sequence doesn't match.
Oh, good. Stella.
I have a little information on the wire from the viewfinder.
it's from a piano.
piano wire, that's strange.
using an ocular micrometer,
I was able to determine the diameter of the wire is 18 gauge.
that's typically used in higher notes.
using the contact points, plying separation and an average applied tension of 67 pounds, I was able to figure out what note it is.
you know what note it is? Yeah.
it's an "A." Oh. An "A.
were you able to determine what kind of piano?
well, um, this particular wire is plated with a tin- phosphorus sulfate.
sulphate preserves the timbre of the wire.
excellent work. Thank you, Kendall.
sure.
she gets a piano wire, I get a...bronze metal thing with bumps on it.
great.
Oh, good, Stella. Um, I have "some information" on the wire I found in the viewfinder.
I did.
I analyzed the trace you recovered from Georgia Morrison's neck wound.
it's Plexiglas, same as the window that was cut out of the Statue of Liberty's crown.
HAWKES: So the instrument used to cut the glass was also used to cut Georgia Morrison's throat.
what about the trace I collected from her arm?
monroe: Latex. More specifically...condom spray.
excuse me, what? I-I didn't catch that.
liquid rubber.
german engineering at its finest.
I'm not sure I understand.
well, allow me to demonstrate.
contrary to what you might have heard, science definitely does matter.
simply... apply, like so...
allow a few moments for a maximum drying time... and...
boom, instant condom.
are you serious? A spray-on condom?
but where does it, uh... the...? Or how...?
never mind.
Stella did find evidence of sexual activity up by the torch.
so, maybe after the fireworks, whoever Georgia Morrison was spraying... killed h?
our missing security guard.
HAWKES: I don't know, guys. It doesn't make sense.
sex and murder I get, but vandalism...?
incompatible.
Charles Price was standing in front of her.
the blood drops deflected off his badge.
he didn't kill Georgia Morrison.
someone else was there.
Adam: Oh, good, Stella.
I got some information on the metal plate Sid recovered.
okay.
it's part of a music box, or the, the guts of a music box, actually.
I was able to replicate it.
when you turn the crank, the thin metal tines brush against the bumps on the plate, creating a musical tone.
hmm?
so, our killer shoved a piece of a music box down our male victim's throat.
do you know what song it is?
it's one of Mozart's early compositions, a minuet and trio that he wrote in 1761，at the age of five, and I kinda figured it was like a, a weird choice for a music box, so I took the liberty of tracking down the owner by contacting local specialists.
it was custom-made for a Nova Kent.
you got a name.
that's huge. Adam...
really good work.
that's how I roll.
what up?!
Mozart wrote that in 1761 when he was five.
it's a artful song.
can I ask you where you found it?
we'll get to that.
do you know him?
hmm, no.
no, I've never seen him before.
his name is Damion Brock.
should I know who that is?
a piece of your music box was shoved down his throat after he was murdered.
this just came for you.
and you.
miss Kent...
miss Kent, it was a metal plate from a music box that you bought.
I lost that music box about a year ago.
are you kidding me? You can't come up with a better lie than that? I move a lot.
four different places in the past year.
I get rid of junk, throw things away. You specifically requested that the music box play Mozart's first minuet.
it seems strange that something with that kind of sentimental value would be... thrown away.
Yeah, well, I cried for three days when I realized it was gone.
you're killing me right now. Okay, look. I got people
I got people waiting for me. Are we done here?
we're done.
good.
for now.
fingerprints match the ones on file with Liberty Island Security.
boat propeller severed the arm?
in one quick swoosh.
two kids fishing off Battery Park got a little turf with their surf.
hmm. Any idea where I can find the rest of him?
given the flow of currents this time of year-- Connecticut.
our victim was dead and floating before the arm was severed.
there was absence of bleeding in the capillaries...
and, see these here?
abrasions.
body floats in the water face-down, arms drag below the torso, the knuckles scrape on the bottom, of the shallow shore.
trace evidence I found here on the back of the hand
Lindsay confirmed as latex.
some kind of spray-on condom?
it must have been blowback from the aerosol canister.
same trace was found on our female security guard.
my guess is Charles Price and Georgia Morrison had sex on the torch, then on their way down the statue, interrupted our vandal, and that's when Georgia was murdered.
let her go! Let her go! Drop the weapon or she's dead!
do it now! Drop it!
move!
HAMMERBACK: Why keep Charles Price alive?
he was the killer's ticket off the island.
uniformed security escort, no questions asked. Then, when he wasn't needed any longer, Charles was the next victim.
the killer followed through on his threat.
two more will die.
no, I don't think so, Sid.
Charles and Georgia surprised him.
that means they were unexpected casualties of the original plan.
explains why there's no apparent connection to our rooftop victim, Damion Brock.
there are two other people out there the killer wants dead.
we gotta get to them before he does.
well, they tracked down Damion Brock's parole officer.
Brock's P. O. said he spoke to him the day before yesterday, and he was happy, and things were going well.
thinking of moving back to Texas when his parole was done.
he didn't detect anything out of the ordinary.
sounds like he kept his nose clean, straightened himself out.
Flack, I've been here before.
it was a crime scene.
a young woman was murdered.
still unsolved.
it's been about ten months.
actually, it was exactly a year ago, Detective Bonasera.
I was your primary suspect for a while there.
of course, Morton.
I... Anyway...
sorry it took me so long to find the keys. Hey, Morton.
yeah? When was the last time you saw Damion Brock?
I don't know, a week ago, maybe.
quiet guy.
very low-maintenance tenant.
does that smell like ammonia?
and death.
something definitely happened in this apartment.
did any of your tenants complain of hearing arguments or loud voices? No.
don't tell me this is happening again.
nobody is gonna want to live in this building if this is happening again. Look, Morton, thank you, but we can take in from here,
do you have any suspects?
do you have any idea who killed Marie?
I stay in touch with her family, and they ask all the time.
I know how much you cared about Marie.
I'm sorry, we don't have anything new right now.
well, let me know if you need anything.
well, this is definitely where he embalmed Damion Brock's body.
what point is this guy trying to make?
I have no idea.
MAN： Please... Oh, God!
please! All right!
all right! I could see from the stairs that it was a van.
a white van.
license plate: T-U... a th-three...
a one... P... or B.
I saw the girl run away. Southern accent-- that's Brock.
I swear to you I don't know! That's the outgoing message.
means Brock and the killer were both here when he recorded it.
sounded like he was being tortured. Flack?
I think he embalmed Brock while he was still alive.
he knows we're here.
he saw the light go on-- he made the phone call to trigger the answering machine.
he knows where we are.
it's time to find out where he is.
I need a trace on a call made to a Damion Brock.
his home number: 212-555...
BONASERA: No. And there's no apparent connection to Damion Brock.
at this point, they both have the killer in common.
this photo has a little bit of background in it.
does that mean anything to anybody?
no, the answers have to be in that photo.
he wouldn't include a picture with a background in it by accident. He led us to the first victim; now he's leading us to the second.
so maybe this connects to some other evidence we have in the case.
well, we got piano wire, we got a music box, we got Plexiglas, Mozart...
music. It's music.
that's not an "E,"
it's an "F."
alistair Friedman Hall.
it's a music hall-- this guy has a thing about music.
the letters are on the corner of a music stand.
alistair Friedman Hall's a big place.
those music stands could be from anywhere-- Julliard, Lincoln Center...
all in one direction-- uptown.
Danny, you're driving.
Stella, see if you can narrow down our target area. Absolutely.
I just talked to Flack.
911 is connected to a call as we speak.
he said it's coming from the same phone that triggered Damion Brock's answering machine.
can we patch it in here and triangulate? Exactly what I was hoping.
this is the 911 operator. Your call is now connected.
come on, come on.
guys, Alistair Friedman Hall is in the 911 call's triangulation search area.
Mac? Our victim and our killer are together.
we have a location.
all right, this is clear.
nobody's here. This place is empty.
that's Danny's voice. Yeah.
911 call's picking him up in the background.
TAYLOR: Stella, we need direction.
there's nobody here-- are we in the right place?
you're definitely in the right place.
we can hear you guys on the 911 call.
they can hear us on the cell phone.
it's here someplace.
hold on, Danny. Don't move.
Yeah, I hear that.
call an ambulance.
Nakashima died in the emergency room.
the killer cut his tongue out, Stella.
Hey, are you all right?
Nakashima's blood contained an excessive amount of sodium pentothal.
truth serum?
could be the cause of death.
so what did our killer want Lee Nakashima to tell the truth about?
dark hair...
green eyes...
he had some facial hair.
Oh!
so this footage was recovered from the cell phone we found with the vic.
killer tossed it in before he sealed it, hoping we'd find them both.
no prints on the phone other than Nakashima's.
paper trail on the purchase of the cell leads to phony names and addresses.
how does Damion Brock connect with Lee Nakashima?
or who did they both piss off?
let's focus on the victims, not the killer.
both these guys had a story to tell about something that happened:
something they saw-- and the killer wanted the truth.
but after he got the truth, he killed them.
right, because he got what he wanted, he didn't need them any longer.
Brock remembered a license plate;
Nakashima gave a description of a man.
but why remember a license plate?
because they were witnesses.
witnesses to a crime.
mac, if I told you to go home and get some rest, you would say...?
what's in the box?
of course you would.
I think I may have found what we're looking for.
lee Nakashima lived in the same building as Damion Brock.
now, Lee moved out seven months ago, but they both lived in the building a year ago when Marie Casimira was murdered.
mac, that's the crime they witnessed.
one of them saw the killer's car and the other his face. Well, if we had that information then, why is the case unsolved?
Nakashima said he was sleeping; Brock said he wasn't home.
they didn't want to get involved for whatever reason.
and Brock's an ex-con.
Nakashima's here on a visa.
keep silent, don't complicate things.
somebody had to know the truth.
someone knew they witnessed a crime.
maybe Marie Casimira's killer.
maybe he saw them before he ran away from the crime scene.
there's no statute of limitations on murder.
when you know there's two people out there who can identify you, you might get a little nervous wondering when that day will come.
okay, but what about the other witnesses our killer wants to silence?
two more will die.
Hey, guys. Sid found this down Lee Nakashima's throat.
BONASERA: Concert ticket.
the killer wanted us to find this, like the music box in Brock's throat.
she's the next target. Where is she?
she went onstage ten minutes ago.
BONASERA: He wanted her to keep quiet.
she was scared.
what?
that's him.
kent: Thank you.
we need you to come with us, please. It's okay.
roll over.
I'm sorry I lied about losing the music box.
Marie was a close friend.
I gave it to her the day she died.
she was an amazing classical pianist.
so how did this flower guy end up with it?
I don't know.
why didn't you just go to the police?
I was too scared.
he saw me. I saw him.
I traded silence for my life.
please don't kill me.
please...
I'll never tell. I'll never tell.
he let me go.
for whatever reason, he let me live.
I thought it was over, but two months later, I realized it would never be over.
he started sending me black calla lilies.
so you kept moving to get away.
but he always found me.
I wanted to tell somebody so bad.
I thought about it every single day.
I was... I was just too scared.
I didn't want to die.
man: I am telling you for the 1, 500th time I don't know who these guys are!
I didn't kill them, and I've never been to the Statue of Liberty ever.
Anthony, come on.
Brock, and Nova could all identify you as the man who killed Marie Casimira.
no.
I just want to let you know that we have a suspect in custody in Marie's case.
that's good.
I'm glad.
it's been a long year.
well, I'm sorry about what happened, Morton.
I couldn't have killed her, I loved her.
that's a partial license plate.
only you swap the B for a P, the 1 for an L.
Tulip3. That's the flower delivery van you were driving the night you killed Marie Casimira.
Brock saw it, Nakashima gave a description.
Nova saw you, you saw them all.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say the jury's probably not gonna buy the twin tulip van defense.
I didn't kill them!
you're being charged with four murders.
if you're lucky enough to escape the death penalty, that's four life sentences.
coming clean could be the difference between living and dying.
have a think on that.
I only saw her.
I wanted to make sure she was keeping her mouth shut.
I went there to scare her, not to kill her. Why tonight?
I got a phone call saying she was talking to the police.
I want a lawyer.
morton: Marie's parents will be really glad to know that justice has been served.
I gotta figure out how to say that in Italian.
perfect.
what do you think?
we have any physical evidence that puts him in the Statue of Liberty or Damion Brock's apartment?
no, we're still collecting trace, but you believe him?
I believe a year ago he killed Marie Casimira, but the rest doesn't add up.
mac, we just ran Colton's cell records.
there's an incoming call from the same phone that we found on Lee Nakashima.
so unless this guy Colton is playing games, and calling himself...
all right, I think our friend in there is gonna stick with his lies, so I'm gonna go rattle the public defender on call.
this guy didn't kill Nakashima or Brock.
are you telling me that we got the wrong guy?
Flack, why would Colton coerce his victims into confessing details of a crime that identifies him as the killer then leave that information at the scene for the police to find?
it doesn't make sense.
wait a minute.
a dead guy can't lock his door.
and the only way to lock a deadbolt's from the outside.
with a key.
you play piano?
I'm taking lessons.
Marie inspired me, actually.
it's her piano.
it's beautiful.
kendall: It's from a piano. It's an A.
don't move.
no, no!
stop!
Morton, step into the light and put your hands up!
I tried to tell everyone there were witnesses, but nobody was listening.
people saw what happened to Marie and they said nothing.
they were cowards.
Morton, I don't want to see either one of us get hurt, all right?
there's other ways to go about this.
routine-- that's how I knew.
I mean, Nakashima, he watches everything, staring out his window.
complaining about every move his neighbors make.
and Brock, Brock sits out on his little ledge smoking every night, and the smell of his tobacco drifts down into my apartment.
I knew he was there.
I made those cowards talk.
it was the only way to get at the truth and to lead you to her killer.
that's when you knew Nova Kent had seen the whole thing.
Brock said that a girl ran away. That was Nova, right?
she was her friend.
how could she not say something?
how do you see something like that and not say anything?
how do you let an innocent man be accused of a crime he didn't commit?
I did not kill Marie.
what about the Statue of Liberty, Morton?
for Marie. She deserved something big.
it was easy. I snuck on the island with an electrical crew when they were doing the security reboot and I made my move.
did you see all of the media coverage?
you would still be sitting in your office thumbing through your case file if I hadn't gotten your attention.
can you hear me now?
loud and clear, Morton.
mac, what are you still doing here?
I'm still on London time.
it's breakfast.
you just finish with Morton Brite?
he's at Central Booking.
the Statue of Liberty was a way to get our attention.
the strangest thing? Even after he knew who killed Marie, never crossed his mind to go after Anthony Colton.
for some, the greatest sin is to turn away and do nothing.
go home.
Yeah.
Taylor.
give me a couple hours, I'll get back to you on that.
I've killed him!
get back! Get back!
stay back.
I've killed him.
killed who? - Kevin.
chelsea dorms-- 9: 45.
do you hear me? - It's 10: 15.
was that this morning?
last night? - No.
you kevin murray?
Yeah. What...What do you want?
I want you to put this towel on and get dressed.
deep puncture wound over the left carotid.
lacerations to the neck and shoulders don't appear to be self-inflicted.
nudity, headgear, apparent dementia...
think we should be checking with bellevue?
right over there.
let's check with him first.
no, i've never seen this guy before.
sure about that?
Yeah, i'm sure. Why?
because he just confessed to your murder.
he...
well, obviously he was wrong. I mean...
actually, it's a little early to tell.
said he came from the future.
and he doesn't kill you till tomorrow.
Hey. You guys going to catch that fruitcake, or what?
he scared the hell out of my kids.
I think i just found our murder weapon.
no evidence to suggest he was stabbed here.
and no blood trail leading up to this point.
that means the glass was already in his neck.
a shard this size, tamponation would've prevented a lot of blood loss, until he pulled it out.
which would explain the arterial spray.
so...
where was our vic before he was here?
so what's your major, kevin?
physics, i study physics.
I told you that already.
how about extracurricular activities?
you sign up to play nutball with our friend in the helmet?
no. For the last time, i told you, i don't know that guy.
what were you doing before i pulled you out of the shower this morning?
I went jogging around campus.
anybody with you? Anyone see you?
I don't know.
come on, kid, you had to kill him before he made good on his promise to kill you, right?
am i under arrest here?
no.
you're free to go.
we appreciate your time.
well...
can you at least tell me what he said? - What who said?
the guy-- about me dying tomorrow.
I'm sorry, that's part of ongoing investigation.
this morning you said he'd been to the future.
did he say how or where or when i'd be killed?
again, unless you have some information to share that might shed some light on our victim,
I don't see what else we can do for you.
how about guaranteeing me i'm still alive in 24 hours.
nobody knows what the future holds.
come on. Bye-bye. Thank you.
must have been a hell of a pickle.
the city's best.
looks like somebody might have enjoyed the pickle with her.
no i. d.Nothing in the purse but an allergy inhaler and enough change for coffee.
vic's hands show cadaveric spasm.
same with her toes.
it was a typical nighttime crowd.
dumb kids, blue-hairs and blowhards.
then things started to get really weird.
Oh, my... Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my...
personally, i've given much better performances.
she was clearly faking it.
take it from a man who knows, sweetheart, that show was all real.
that was the most disgusting young woman i have ever seen come...
in here for a cup of coffee, then some guy joins her.
I bring back the pickles, the next thing you know...
tell me more about the guy.
some jock, probably around her age.
wearing a chelsea shirt and had a t rex tattoo on his arm.
can i get your phone number?
why, you in trouble?
no, but i'd like to be.
so did you give him your number?
the bottom line is, the busboy and every other witness that i spoke to said the two of them never made any physical contact.
and a few folks told me that she seemed upset before the fireworks even started.
anything else about the guy?
whoever he was, he didn't stick around to cuddle.
maybe this time harry killed sally.
it definitely attracted the mercury.
and the way it magnetically pooled on the back of his hand,
is what first drew my attention to the chip.
any idea why it was in his hand?
no, but the fresh scarring tells me it hasn't been there long
a week or two tops.
I found injection points around the wound, a faint trace of local anesthetic in the surrounding tissues.
and it was sealed with cyanoacrylate adhesive.
superglue.
I found traces of it on his fingers.
which suggests our vic implanted the chip himself.
and there's something else.
what's he got lodged in his brain?
you want to help me find out?
skydiving GIFT CERTIFICATE VOTED NEW YORK'S BEST
could you fall for a guy like me? Drew
there's safer ways to beat the traffic.
Oh, traffic i can handle.
men are another story.
what is it?
gift certificate for a skydiving lesson.
I met this guy in an antique store, and then bumped into him again at a coffee stand and,
suddenly, he wants to hold hands at 10, 000 feet.
so he sent me a parachute.
original... And daring.
and a bit too aggressive for me.
what?
you were smiling when you opened the box.
mac, my last boyfriend tried to kill me, and i shot him.
well, maybe this guy's a little different.
why don't you just run him through nyspin?
actually, i already did.
there are three drew bedfords in the city.
one is 96 and lives in a rest home.
the other is in juvie for painting boobs on a billboard.
and my original and daring friend is, uh, squeaky-clean.
you and i are alike in a lot of ways.
we both do everything we can to avoid this sort of thing.
but sometimes you just got to take the plunge.
so you're telling me to fall for all this?
Stella, peyton pursued me.
I never thought i'd enjoy another relationship either.
forget about all the risks of romance and...
enjoy the rewards.
it's an r-fid transponder.
radio frequency identification.
is it active or passive?
it's active, so it's not only receiving a signal from a distant control point,
but it's also drawing on its own power supply and transmitting the signal to the same place.
like a handheld gps unit.
only, this time, it was hand-mounted.
why would our vic go through all the pain and trouble of installing his own internal compass?
I don't know but, if we can just capture the signal, maybe we can figure out where it's phoning home.
hang on. Hang on.
we're getting something. Come on. Come on.
freeze it.
they're latitude and longitude coordinates.
let's see where they lead us.
mac, is this what i think it is?
it's a very elaborate attempt at time travel.
you guys talking time machine?
paging dr. who.
you mean dr. browning. Mac, this is our john doe.
got any pictures of him in a straitjacket?
believe me, flack, this is no madman.
I've read about this guy.
Dr. martin browning was a cutting-edge genius.
he even won a klimko prize for advanced math and physics.
so, what, now he's graduated to time travel?
well, if anybody could do it, it would be him.
looks like this is where his time finally ran out.
this thing looks like an electric chair with mood lighting.
I mean, we all agree here, right?
time travel only happens in movies,
or under the influence of certain controlled substances.
hard to believe browning would be messing around with something like this.
but he was truly a genius.
there's a fine line between genius and insanity.
thinking kevin murray's the one who put a permanent end to his future
kid's got a shaky alibi at best.
so if you guys can place him here, i'd be more than happy to place him in lockup.
someone came knocking a little too hard.
I can tell you that much.
I don't know.
if i could go anywhere back in time?
probably go back to my folks' place in queens for one of my ma's corned beef wednesdays.
Yeah.
I would endure every one of my brother's insults at the table for one more taste of that paradise.
the late, great dr. Browning would have told you that it's practically impossible to go back in time without a wormhole.
sorry?
it's a hypothetical tunnel that connects distant regions of space and time.
and, as of today, nobody has found one.
and since we haven't been visited by any tourists from the future,
I think it's a pretty safe bet that nobody's going to find one tomorrow either.
so it is all make-believe.
not necessarily.
in theory, if you built a machine that could travel the speed of light away from here,
then slowed down, turned around, and flew home just as fast, when you got back, a trip that might have lasted seconds for you could have been weeks for everybody else.
kind of like your explanation.
it's heady stuff, flack, i know, but browning was a genius.
I mean, come on, he may have been on to something.
or maybe he was out of money.
according to this racing form, he played the horses at hillridge downs last week.
and looks like he was trying his luck with the lottery as well.
but a klimko prize comes with a million and a half bucks.
it's hard to imagine browning in a tight spot for cash.
the evidence speaks otherwise.
in 1982, the u. s.mint lowered the copper content in pennies as a cost-saving measure.
they switched to a lighter, copper-zinc blend,
but pennies that were made before that, they're much heavier
almost the weight of a quarter.
so, if you just rough up the edges a little bit...
you get a great return on your investment.
trouble is, when i spoke to the building's landlord,
he said that browning didn't own a car.
then whoever's been shaving pennies may know who killed him.
or be our killer.
we keeping you up? - No.
my brain just needs a little oxygen.
looks like it needs more than that.
I found a few interesting marks on your unknown coed.
okay...
sad face?
one of 27 drawn with a permanent marker,
then washed away, save for residual pigmentation.
maybe some sort of compulsive behavior?
uh, i don't know. Take a look.
give me a hand? - Yeah.
now, see that?
there's no way she could have done all this to herself.
unless she was capable of drawing on her own buttocks.
I knew a kid back in the bronx who could blow out a candle with...
what about stomach content?
black coffee and pickles, part of your nutritious breakfast.
so far, we're not hearing cod.
I see you're not much for foreplay.
very well.
in this case, the cause of death was aortic aneurysm due to extreme sexual excitement.
the victim's pupils would have dilated.
her breathing accelerated.
and with elevated natural levels of endorphins and oxytocin, her increased heart rate triggered vasocongestion and pudendal reflex.
death by orgasm?
yes and no.
tox found something else in her blood that shouldn't have been there.
Methylenedioxyphenylacetone.
it's an analog to ecstasy and methamphetamine,
but i really haven't seen anything like it in any of our databases.
I don't know. Some kind of designer drug.
that's what i thought at first, but this was pure.
not what you'd expect from a homemade cocktail.
and it was administered at a very high dosage,
which would have easily led to acute neuromuscular myotonia.
how in the world did this poor girl get her hands on a drug that turns pleasure into pain?
the prints i lifted off the penny got me nothing in afis.
what are you staring at?
Dr. hawkes gave me this computer to data-comb and,
just as i thought my mind was about to explode, all right?
check out this internet posting i came across.
wanted. assistant to travel through time.
must be of sound mind and body.
this is not science fiction.
I have seen the future.
in other words, our suspect pool has gotten a whole lot deeper.
it's a number nine steel sewing needle.
consistent with those used by industry for making fine stitches through heavy fabric.
but we carefully studied his skull.
there were no puncture wounds of any kind.
must have happened when he was an infant.
Oh, shh, it's okay.
we're okay.
Oh, okay... Go here...
probably through a fontanel before the cranial sutures had fused.
and the needle's position would have very likely prompted petit mal seizures,
which would have only gotten worse with any low-level electrical stimulus, like...
like from the time machine.
Plus, he'd have no memory of the seizures afterwards.
might have even thought he'd been to the future.
if you look at the way the needle bridged his corpus callosum,
it literally connected both hemispheres of his brain.
linear logic on the left was directly hardwired into right brain intuition.
this needle may have actually been responsible for his genius in the first place.
Kevin murray-- the kid we interviewed-- we know he studies physics at chelsea.
was browning still on the faculty?
an honorary position.
well, then, do us the honor of finding out what the dean might know about either of them.
martin browning was my star pupil.
I was proud to sign his diploma.
I mean, he grew up in a sewing factory.
that's pretty impressive.
but as dean, it must have been a little hard watching him surpass you so quickly.
I beg your pardon.
I never once begrudged his success.
nor did i take any pleasure when he started to...
lose his mind?
for god's sake, the man should have just enjoyed his early retirement.
instead, he chose to experiment with how much he could embarrass all of us.
no room in the curriculum for time travel 101, i guess.
what exactly is it you want from me?
Dean risenhoover, I found blood and epithelial residue on the door knocker outside of martin browning's apartment.
why don't you just tell me what happened to your forehead?
martin was a sick man.
I mean, he struggled with seizures since he was a child,
but over the last six month, it was...
it was different. It was like something in him snapped.
I tried phoning him and e-mailing, but he wouldn't respond,
so i thought if i went to see him in person, maybe i could finally get him some help.
Dr. browning? Open up.
he doesn't want to see you! Get outta here!
instead, i was attacked by someone claiming to be his assistant.
can you describe the person that attacked you?
black hair with a bad attitude.
a student perhaps?
it's possible.
Dean, are you familiar with a junior named kevin murray?
we have hundreds of studenthes here.
why didn't you report this when it first happened?
because i finally decided to wash my hands of martin.
I could see already there'd be nothing but trouble in his future.
hard to know that without traveling through time.
our vic's allergy inhaler was tampered with.
I lifted prints from the inner cartridge and they didn't match our jane doe's.
and instead of an oral antihistamine,
someone inserted something called pt-604 in the chamber.
ever heard of it? - No.
but i also never heard of an elephant eating kosher dills, either.
the dust i collected from the booth came back as dentin ivory trace from some kind of pachyderm.
well, sid didn't find trace of the dust anywhere on our vic, so it couldn't have been what killed her.
well, if the guy in the booth is our perp,
maybe this dust can help me follow his trail.
Kevin murray. 9: 45.
do you hear me?
I'll be damned.
he was right on schedule.
this place was sealed tight after you guys processed the crime scene.
Yeah, well, it looks like kevin murray found his way in.
I knew that kid was lying.
he was asking all those questions about browning to find out what we knew.
Kevin murray must have been the assistant risenhoover talked about.
probably one of browning's students.
he broke back in, tried to use the machine.
then our killer killed himself.
the way this contraption was wired,
I'm surprised it didn't kill both of them a long time ago.
I don't remember photographing that before.
you couldn't have.
because it wasn't there.
any luck with the prints off the inhaler cartridge?
nothing in afis, but when i tested the inhaler's contents, guess what it matched?
the mystery drug sid found in tox? - Exactly.
so i contacted the manufacturer.
turns out it's an experimental sexual enhancement drug only available in clinical trials.
don't look at me. I don't need it.
you're too old anyway.
it's currently being tested on students at the chelsea university health center.
that's like throwing gas on a raging hormonal fire.
well, detective angell just got me a court order to pull all the patient files and talk to the students directly.
I'm hoping that this will give us an i. d.on the perp.
fantastic.
we got horny college kids, and horny mammals. You want to trade?
mammals?
prehistoric, to be exact.
I had the trace from the deli carbon-dated.
that was no elephant that was munching on pickles at kraus'.
we're looking at a four-million- year-old mastodon.
you like to play dirty, huh, kid?
get up! Get up!
they didn't teach you not to run in a museum?
the only person in the city currently working on mastodons.
Yeah, well, that's when he's not, you know, leaving girls for dead in a deli.
look, i'm sorry.
if i tell you the truth, i'm gonna be screwed out of a scholarship and...
they'll screw you out of a lot worse than that on the cell block.
you better tell us everything you know about that girl.
her name is robin graham, and i only followed her to the deli 'Cause i didn't want her to be pissed off, but, you know...
then she started just...
Yeah, right, right, right, we know, we know.
why don't you stay focused on why she was upset in the first place?
come on, man, we do it every year.
it was just a stupid raffle, but, you know...
hundred bucks to play and my name got drawn, so i got her all to myself, you know?
then when i made my move, sh-sh-she freaked, so i followed her to the deli.
I tried talking to her, i did, you know, but then,
you know, she just started wigging in front of everybody.
I don't know, i-i just bailed.
you know, for a smart kid, you're a real bonehead. Let's go.
so you're a part of this pt-604 clinical study here at the university?
they paid me 150 bucks and i spent a week straight in bed with my boyfriend.
then when he couldn't take it anymore, i got myself a new boyfriend.
Oh, my god...
it was off the hook.
what about robin graham?
have you ever seen her in the clinic?
or somewhere else?
on campus maybe?
no, i haven't seen her anywhere, and i'd rather not if she looks like that.
well, that's it for the control patients.
you want the placebos, too?
no, these were the only kids participating in the study with direct access to the drug.
and the student health center has prints on file for every one of them.
okay, let's get those back to the lab, see what they have to say.
did you know that i was the third-grade hopscotch champion of hawthorne elementary?
I don't remember seeing that on your resume? No.
well, trust me, i played and won 'em all,
but i never saw a hopscotch game like this one, and that's because it's not hopscotch.
it's game theory.
exactly, but i didn't make the connection
until you sent the time machine manual over for analysis.
look how similar these formulas are.
Dr. browning was using complex game theory tables to calculate mathematical probabilities like
which horse might win the next race or what lottery ticket might pay off.
or who might be next to die.
he knew the machine was broken.
browning's blood was on the chalk. He used it.
this is the formula he scribbled to figure out the odds of kevin's survival
if he tried to use it after he was gone.
K, kevin.
faster than light. Time of death: 9: 45.
but if the machine was busted, why would kevin have gotten in it?
when you figure probability, there's usually choices to make.
maybe kevin didn't have one.
so who the hell is l?
I don't know, but you might want to check your math.
according to sid, kevin's body showed signs of defensive wounds, which occurred prior to electrocution.
I also got another partial print off this manual which doesn't match kevin's,
and here's the kicker
the blood sample we took off the cover is an exact match to dr. Martin browning and it was wet blood.
that puts him in the room and on the day.
but we all know he was dead in the drawer when kevin got killed.
well, dr. browning did say he'd been to the future.
I think it's high time we separate the science from the science fiction.
browning's blood was rehydrated.
mechanics OF TIME TRAVEL" by MARTIN BROWNING. Ph. D
the book was left on the seat.
there had to be somebody else in the room.
l is our real killer.
I don't get it, mac.
they're something we're missing.
okay, we've got three partial prints
one from the shard, one from the book and one from the penny.
Lindsay, hand me that piece of paper.
thumbs. - What?
none of these partials match either of our victims, right?
and there was no hit in afis
because we didn't have enough surface area on any print to confirm a match.
you just handed me this piece of paper.
your thumb left a print. When i grip this penny...
thumbprints.
if l held the manual, scraped the pennies for the meter, we...
put the partials together...
and...
a complete print.
let's see if we get a hit.
what, i'm not beat up enough?
you're lucky my men pulled those bookies off you when they did.
how much you into them for?
7, 500 bucks.
what happened, your luck finally run out?
you must have been licking your chops when you saw martin browning's classified ad.
nice address, swank apartment.
probably figured you could shave a few pennies
and play along with his time travel story just long enough
to lift yourself a new stereo or flat screen tv.
that was no story, man.
he could really travel through time.
look, when i first showed up, he already had college boy for an assistant.
so, yeah, i admit it, i conned him into letting me stick around long enough to case the place.
and then he started taking those trips.
you know, didn't look like he went anywhere,
but he said at faster than the speed of light we wouldn't be able to see him move anyway.
so i decided just to test him a little, you know. Bang.
he comes back with the damn trifecta... Twice.
that's when i started to believe, and i got to tell you,
man, that was the best damn run of my life.
till you got greedy.
tried to force him to take another trip.
Hey, doc, number six, soldier of rome.
I need this, man. - It's not safe!
it's not ready! - I need one more!
I didn't build this for you!
get away from me!
you got to get in that machine!
get up! - Get away from me!
so you murdered martin browning.
I didn't mean to.
I even tried to chase after him, make sure he was all right, you know.
but it was too late.
you guys going to catch the fruitcake or what?
once you knew he was dead, you had to find another way to try and cover your losses.
I was too deep in the hole, man.
I flunked out of sixth grade science.
there was no way in hell i was going to learn How to fix that thing on my own, much less drive it.
move. - I'm going.
I said move!
I had to get the kid back to the time machine.
now remember, pick three in the trifecta, number two race. - All right, move, man!
all right, first thing you do is you check the regulator thing.
what is it? - Got that.
come on, hurry up.
hit it! - It's going.
I don't know what happened.
you know, we... We tried to read the manual.
but, hey, you guys are smart, right?
maybe if we work together, we could fix it, you know?
try to make things...
sorry, time's up.
you lied, kelsey, you did know robin graham.
okay, you're right.
she wanted to be a gamma delta gamma.
she wanted to be my little sis, but neither of those things was going to happen until we took care of her business.
who told you that robin was a virgin?
she did.
during the mirror ceremony.
mirror ceremony?
it's just a little ritual we use to help pledges face their flaws.
but the minute i heard about her virginity, i knew she'd need a little extra help.
is that what you guys call a virgin sacrifice?
that's what the frat boys call it.
nobody was going to make her do anything that she didn't want to.
what do you call switching out her allergy inhaler?
setting the mood.
this way...
I knew she was allergic to flowers from all the ceremonies since the beginning of the semester.
so i figured i'd just use that to loosen her up a little.
I mean, it worked for me.
guess you couldn't be bothered with any contraindications.
Contra-huh?
the fine print that you didn't bother to read before you made the swap.
you see, with these clinical trials,
they're really not sure exactly how it's going to react with the patient's preexisting condition.
like robin's asthma.
see, when she didn't get any relief from her inhaler after the first couple of puffs, She had to have more.
Yeah, and that's when she lost control of herself in front of god and everybody.
you killed that girl.
it was just an accident.
that you caused.
you got to be kidding.
you can't pin this on me.
Oh, yes, we can.
we found your prints on the rose petals,
and they match the prints we found on the cartridge used to kill her.
so now we're going to perform a little ritual we like to call arresting you for manslaughter.
turn around.
turn around!
well, at least she went with a smile on her face.
no, and i can promise you this...
you won't either. Let's go.
dear mac...
I'm writing you this letter because i know if i call,
the moment i hear your voice, i'll be lost.
I know you only left london last month because it was time to go home.
but what i've realized since then is that this is my home.
there's a new job for me here.
my family is here.
my life is here, mac, and as much as i would've loved for you to stay and be a part of it,
I know that your work and your life, would inevitably take you away.
we could fly back and forth in one of those commuter relationships for awhile, I'm sure, but as close as we are, there would still always be an ocean between us.
so it's best we say good-bye, my love.
sorry, mac, but i've got another file...
smallpox, yellow fever, influenza, you had the bubonic plague.
what are you talking about, pops?
long ago, when several coffins were excavated and scratches were found inside...
our ancestors, they realized they'd been burying folks before their time.
no, kid, back then when the plagues hit, guys like you and me, we couldn't dig fast enough.
come on.
saved by the bell?
doesn't mean what you think.
morticians would tie a string to the hand of the dead person and take the other end of the string and tie it to a bell above ground.
and immediately after the burial, a person from the mortuary would be assigned the task to sit by the new gravesite and listen for the bell to ring.
that was called the "graveyard shift.
you're freaking me out, you know that?
my god! What...?
I am gonna kill you!
thanks for coming.
all my guys are on that cessna crash in suffolk.
the report said a little girl was missing?
that's her in the middle.
we have alerts out.
the rest of the family's inside.
no signs of b&e, the place doesn't look tossed.
shaping up like a murder-suicide.
and just so you know, the media's gonna be all over this.
Yeah, multiple homicide.
it's expected.
no, this one's gonna be covered differently.
Why's that?
31 years ago, the former owner, bill willens, shot himself in this house.
two days later, his daughter disappeared.
bill's wife betty claims her husband was hearing voices.
he told people the house was possessed by evil spirits.
just like the amityville horror.
all I know is the folks inside this house were good people.
for gil duncan to shoot his family, commit suicide, there's got to be an explanation other than...
ghosts made him do it.
this is detective monroe.
it's october 31st, 2007, 23: 30 hours.
I'm at 1135 ocean avenue, amityville, new york.
I have two bodies in the hall, both male.
believed to be the sons, tommy and charlie duncan.
both are lying prone in a north-to-south direction.
both appear to have sustained single gunshot wounds to the back.
no apparent stippling, indicating they were shot from medium or long range.
gravitational blood drops indicate both victims were running towards the door when they were shot.
third victim, female, believed to be amy duncan, age 35.
also received single gunshot wound to the back.
no apparent stippling.
final victim, believed to be gil duncan, age 38, shotgun six inches east of his left hand.
single gunshot wound to the abdomen.
circular bruise pattern can be seen around the wound, bulge on one end, consistent with the weapons foresight, indicates a close contact shot, also consistent with suicide.
all right, I'm out of step plates.
I'm gonna go grab some more, all right?
what's up?
what's the matter?
what? - Shh, listen.
please, help me...
there's someone inside the wall.
stay back from the wall!
help me!
I'm gonna get ya.
it's rose from the photo.
all right, hang on, sweetie.
okay, hang on sweetheart, I got you.
she's been shot.
get her to a hospital now!
excuse me.
happy holloweird, mac.
looks like quite a massacre.
zombie flash mob?
Yeah, I don't get it either.
so stella told me your mysterious caller disappeared.
I haven't got a call at 3: 33 A. M. In over a week.
maybe your guy decided it was time to stop stalking you.
maybe he's getting ready to take it the next level.
Hey, meet john doe.
wallet's missing and no one's stepping forward to say they recognize him.
witnesses say they saw him hit the deck, but they thought he was just overacting.
got the torn clothes, dirt, blood blunt-force trauma to the head.
nothing fake about that.
medium-velocity spatter indicates he could have been hit here.
blood trail?
I don't know.
we've tested 30 stains, so far-- all fake.
so we don't know if we're looking at a primary or a secondary crime scene.
all we had is our vic and 300 zombies crammed into midtown vandalizing stores, stalling traffic and scaring tourists.
all for a laugh.
maybe someone didn't get the joke.
trick or treat!
Hey-hey!
mom?
yes?
I don't feel so good.
someone ate too much candy.
come on. Let's go home.
Danny is that you?
get out!
get out!
I told them to leave!
I warned them, but you still have a chance!
leave this house.
leave now or it will get you!
whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
you didn't see her?
see who?
I got my men doing a canvas of the neighborhood, grid search of the yard.
but so far, no evidence of any elderly female intruder.
do you not believe me?
all I'm saying is people come to town and get caught up in the folklore.
do we look like we're here buying postcards?
sheriff, we've all got a lot of work to do -
if you and your men would just secure the perimeter, that'd be greatly appreciated.
right.
thank you.
forget about this guy.
you saw the old woman who grabbed you.
she went down that secret corridor?
right. Like she already knew where it was.
Danny, she said that she warned the duncans to stay out of the house.
that something was going to happen.
she knows something.
we should find her.
well, she couldn't have gotten too far on foot.
we'll find her soon enough.
Hey, you know what? She scratched my arm.
if she left her dna behind, we might not have to wait that long.
quite the ambience, sid.
Halloween is the one day of the year we're allowed -
encouraged to celebrate the dead.
for without death, one cannot appreciate life.
what about this one?
cod is subdural hematoma.
wound like this often isn't immediately fatal.
your vic could have been somewhat lucid, and even walking or stumbling for about 15 minutes post impact.
okay, so if he was transient after he was hit, it means that midtown isn't our primary crime scene.
any idea on the murder weapon?
that's tricky, mac.
your vic suffered blunt force trauma as well as sharp force trauma.
the sharp force trauma wounds are approximately a half inch wide and extend into the bone.
looks like chopping wounds.
may be looking for an axe or a machete.
even more interesting, is the blunt force trauma.
it was localized in the parietal region of the skull.
looks like a "w" or an "M.
murder weapon had raised lettering on it.
he could have been hit with two different weapons.
anything else?
found wood-like fibers under his nails.
already sent them up to trace.
finally, for what I can't explain:
body temp indicates your vic has been dead for eight hours, even though witness reports established he's been dead for three.
means he died twice.
that's not possible.
well, I didn't find any bite marks on him or human brains in his stomach contents.
but he was dead before he was killed.
which medically makes him a zombie.
happy halloween.
heaven's so far away heaven's so far away cherry, cherry, cherry cherry, cherry, cherry cherry, cherry, cherry, baby heaven's so far away cherry on the lips heaven's so far away now tell me baby who's your daddy?
marks on our vic's head weren't made by two different weapons -
they were made by one cricket bat.
any luck, with narrowing down primary crime scenes?
Yeah, I have a radius of origin.
and considering his injuries, our vic could have kept walking for up to half a mile before collapsing.
I'll get flack working on a canvas.
if we can find where our vic was coming from, maybe we can find our killer.
I don't get it. Who puts a secret passageway in their own house?
probably from the prohibition era.
a lot of these homes out here had them back then.
guessing rose discovered the room when the family moved in.
when she saw her father go on a rampage, she went in there to hide.
and that's when the shot went through the wall and hit her.
you know, the only question I have is, if gil wanted to kill his whole family, why not go after rose?
there's no bloody footprints.
there's no indication that he went looking for her.
I mean, unless he knew she was behind the wall and he shot her deliberately.
maybe gil's not our shooter.
this pad's giving me a weak positive.
there's only trace amounts of gunshot residue.
if he handled this gun, he'd have gsr all over him.
but what about the circular bruise pattern on the wound?
that's consistent with a close contact shot.
I'm thinking the shot cup could have made this mark.
well, that means our contact shot isn't a contact shot at all.
which means gil might not have shot himself.
we've got to get this to hawkes for testing.
Danny, gil duncan didn't kill himself.
distance determination showed the muzzle of the barrel was about four feet away when gil was shot.
so there's no way he could have reached the trigger.
so we're not looking at a murder-suicide.
we're looking for a killer.
trajectory of the shot suggest that our shooter was standing right around here when he pulled the trigger.
which means our killer left this footprint.
it's the hospital.
Hi, rose.
I'm detective monroe, and this is detective messer.
we're trying to find out who hurt your family.
the monster.
you saw a monster in your house?
those belong to our zombie?
Yeah. Clothes we got from the vic.
nothing unusual, though.
he was covered in dirt.
gravitational blood drops on the shoe confirm the victim was up and walking when he was hit.
but found this a little strange.
a diaper?
our vic was wearing it.
tested positive for urine.
seemed a little young for incontinence issues.
could have been his costume, or he could have been drinking and just knew how hard it was to find a bathroom in midtown manhattan on any day, let alone halloween.
tox came back totally clean.
our vic wasn't drinking.
and the wood-like substance that sid found under his fingernails turned out to be jute coated with traces of a water-based varnish.
Jute's usually used in rope and rugs.
where did the varnish come from?
a coffin.
Flack did a little digging.
he found out that two cemetery groundskeepers reported a zombie attack last night.
half of manhattan reported zombie attacks last night.
Yeah, but this one was different.
diggers reported they were filling a grave when a man broke through a coffin -
but not just any coffin, it was biodegradable, made from jute.
very easy to get out of.
did you get an I. D. From the funeral home?
Yeah.
the vic's name is dexter nevins.
35 years old, married to a sophia nevins.
we're trying to find her now.
Dexter was an immigration attorney.
his funeral was yesterday afternoon.
small ceremony.
he's not saying what I think he's saying, is he?
we may have discovered where our vic first rose from the dead.
think our vic could have squeezed through that hole?
if he was desperate enough.
those are definitely scratch marks.
how did dexter nevins get buried alive?
Flack's pulling the death certificate to see who pronounced him dead.
that's a voodoo doll, mac.
maybe this will tell us who wanted him dead.
so what do we have that'll put us on the trail of our doll maker?
found a photo of our vic torn up in the doll's head.
morley cigarettes, bottle of haitian rum and three extremely rare haitian blue coffee beans.
according to an internet search, all these items right here are traditional offerings to baron samedi, voodoo god of the dead.
even creepier, the hair on the doll's head was a match to dexter nevins.
this wasn't some toy.
this was made specifically for dexter.
only voodoo didn't kill him, a blow to the head did.
except there's no reason to make a voodoo doll other than to wish harm on someone.
speaks to prior motive.
true.
Yeah, but wouldn't we expect, though, to find the doll with the killer and not the victim?
unless our killer decided to bury the evidence. With the body.
the only flaw to that perfect plan -
when your vic decides to come back to life.
I hate zombies.
I know.
they spoil all the fun, don't they?
so whoever made this doll may have used dexter nevins as the ultimate sacrifice.
went through a reference catalog of shotgun wounds and the spread pattern on gil was consistent with dr. Hawkes' findings;
four feet seems about right.
also found numerous hairs while removing the victims' clothing.
they didn't look human, so I sent them up to kendall and she said they came back to multiple dog breeds, one being a tibetan kyiapso.
it's supposed to be extremely rare.
there's nothing here in the house that indicates the family had a dog, sid.
then maybe your killer did.
maybe, yeah.
Hey, linds, I took a look at those shoeprints you sent back to the lab.
they're work boots, size 11.
gill duncan wore size nine.
what about the shotgun?
no prints.
looks like it was wiped down.
did find trace on the trigger guard, though.
chromatographic fingerprint revealed it's sap from pinus strobus, also known as the eastern white pine tree.
it's indigenous to...
wait a minute.
did you say white pine?
Yeah, that's right.
Sheldon, I'll call you back.
Hawkes said he found sap from the eastern white pine on the murder weapon.
this is a white pine.
Yeah, check it out.
those branches are broken.
our killer could have climbed this tree...
onto the second story, made his way over to that roof and into the attic.
there's a footprint with sap and bark on the roof.
more sap on the frame.
that confirms point of entry.
there's a shirt.
it's about the only thing not covered in dust.
I got something.
it looks like I got absorbents right here.
small tears, sap.
this belonged to our shooter.
that's a latent blood stain underneath the dust, which means somebody tried to cover this up a while ago.
let me see that.
there's sweat all over this shirt.
Yeah, well, it's like a sauna up here.
the amount of sweat; I think our shooter was up here for a while.
but the question is what was he waiting for?
excuse me.
we're looking for...
thank you.
the man is cursed.
excuse me?
the tower card...
the hanged man...
and the devil.
be careful!
I have strangers here, I see.
your names?
mac taylor, stella bonasera, nypd.
how can I help you, detectives?
miss delacroix, did you make this doll?
it might be one of mine.
well, we found haitian blue ce offebeans inside of this doll and yours is the only store in the city that sells them.
we believe the doll was specifically made for one man.
this man here. He was murdered last night.
we need to know who you made the doll for.
what are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
close your eyes.
what?
I said close your eyes.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
who are you?
Josephine delacroix, I just told you.
how do you know me?
I don'T.
you just walked into my store.
in the past two months,
I've been getting anonymous phone calls, all at 3: 33 in the morning.
some people believe 333 to be a proverb:
the curse of the lord is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the just.
what do you believe it to mean?
333 is the son of the devil, 666, the one who collects souls for the sins of our youth.
okay, we're leaving, but we'll be back.
wait.
this is all my fault.
I did not make that doll for anyone.
I made it for myself.
Mr. Nevins was a client.
his death is my doing.
you killed him?
I put a curse on him.
Why?
Mr. Nevins wanted to know about haitian voodoo.
more specifically, about returning back from the dead.
he said he wanted to know the scam.
I told him there was no scam.
it was voodoo.
so how did the doll get in dexter's coffin?
I put the doll in at the funeral.
the only place for it to be was with mr. Nevins as he greeted baron samedi, god of the dead face-to-face.
it's starting to sound like dexter buried himself alive.
wanted to fake his own death.
you think it was a life insurance scam?
probably.
explains the diaper.
but why plan for a bathroom break and not the fact that you're gonna run out of oxygen 40 minutes after being buried?
and then why have an open-casket funeral when you're trying to fake your own death?
witnesses, in case the insurance company balked.
so how did he fool all those people into believing he was dead?
get anything from the dna off of your arm?
no hits in codus, but when I ran the old woman's dna against the blood that we found in the attic floor,
I found shared alleles at all 16 loci.
so the blood in the attic was from the daughter?
or mother.
and the nmr analysis dated the blood back to 30 years ago.
which is when the willens family lived in that house.
Yeah.
so what does the old lady and the blood in the attic have to do with the duncan family murders?
we need to find out what happened in that house 31 years ago.
Danny, this is the former owner of the house.
okay, this is gonna sound really weird, but I think that's the woman who attacked me.
what would she be doing in her old house?
I don't know, but I'm gonna age this, see if I'm right.
that's her! - I don't get it.
what would make betty willens return to that house after 30 years?
I might be able to answer that.
what do you got?
rose's monster.
DNA from the sweaty shirt you found in the attic came back as betty willens' son henry.
his dna was in the system, and take a look at this tattoo.
rose wasn't imagining it.
she did see a monster.
this guy's been in and out of prison his entire life.
currently on parole after serving a nickel for armed robbery.
his P. O. Got him a job as an animal control officer for the county.
that could explain the dog hair we found on the vic's clothing.
let's bring this guy in.
not so fast. Got to find him first.
reached out to his boss -
turns out henry's been mia with his truck since yesterday.
his last dispatch reported he picked up several dogs and never made it to the pound.
called him at his house, he doesn't answer his phone.
same with his mother, betty.
got an alarm out on both of them.
maybe his truck has one of those anti-theft tracking...
no, no, no, come on, already asked.
you know what, the dogs might.
what?
Sid said that the hairs he found came back to a very expensive breed of dog.
so I'm thinking if I were that pet's owner,
I'd do everything in my power to make sure it never got lost.
you can't lojack a dog though-- wait, can you?
no, but they do make dog collars with gps tracking chips in them.
so you said that that dogs henry picked up never made it back to the pound?
right.
I'm thinking maybe they're still with him.
and if one of those dogs has a gps collar...
then maybe we can track henry down.
Dexter nevins' death certificate.
cod was congestive heart failure and was signed by a dr. Roger burgess.
I think I know how dexter fooled him.
I figured it had to be some type of drug that our routine tox didn't catch or that had already metabolized out of his system.
so I went to our most recent sample.
the diaper.
exactly.
I found tetrodotoxin in dexter's urine.
that would explain why the body temperature didn't reflect time of death.
Dexter would have seemed dead. - Right.
the only question is:
how does an immigration attorney get his hands on a drug like that?
unless he has a friend who's a doctor.
who'd be willing to sign his death certificate, no questions asked.
Dr. Burgess.
Hey, guys.
so I'm loving your insurance scam theory.
Dexter nevins was insured to the hilt.
his wife sophia was the beneficiary and it turns out he and sophia were in major debt.
so dexter's dead and there's a lot of money to be collected.
Where's the wife?
no one can find her.
she hasn't collected the insurance either.
it's like she disappeared.
if dr. Burgess was in on it, they could be together.
took a look at sophia's last credit transactions.
everything stops the day before the funeral, and get this -
the last charge on their joint card -
a helios personal oxygen system.
with oxygen, dexter could have survived ten, 12 hours.
Sophia comes back, digs him up and they split town with the money.
there was no evidence of an oxygen tank in the coffin.
maybe it was never put in the coffin because sophia never intended to dig her husband up.
take a look at this.
this is a real-time map of all the animals that are reported lost and being tracked by ani-trac, the gps collar company.
I got 20 hits in manhattan and western long island.
everything's in motion except for these four.
all right, where is this?
1135 ocean avenue.
that's the duncan's address.
this guy's going back to the crime scene.
that's henry.
don't move.
don't move.
toss the lady. I got him.
what's in the suitcase?
don't.
don't open it.
please!
please don't open it!
don't!
my baby.
my baby.
ma'am, I beg you -
don't let them take my babies.
please, please, please, don't let them.
please.
I beg you, don't let them take them, please.
when you're a little kid, you don't know nothing, you know?
my crazy dad shoots himself in the head, all my mom tells me is, he went to live with the angels.
that's dumb, right?
that's dumb.
my father loved guns.
I loved my father.
when he was gone, I just...
I wanted to keep remembering him, you know.
it just went off.
Henry was never right after that night.
and it was my fault.
I knew I had to protect him.
I knew that they'd take him away or they'd declare me unfit.
I'd already lost my husband.
I couldn't bear losing all that was left of my family.
so you cleaned up the crime scene and you buried your daughter in the house.
only you told everybody that she just disappeared.
and for 31 years, people believed you.
I should... I should have moved her years ago.
I was evicted.
I just didn't think anyone would... - why now?
I read the story in the paper about the old place being sold.
no one had lived there since henry and I left.
everyone thought it was haunted.
except the duncans.
they told reporters they didn't believe in ghosts.
they said that they were looking forward to renovating the old place.
which meant they'd uncover your secret.
so you sent henry to go get your daughter before she could be discovered.
it was all supposed to be so simple.
and those people weren't supposed to be there.
I mean, it was halloween, you know.
I waited till they left.
but they came home early, because little charlie had a stomachache.
and when they found you inside their house you killed them all.
I panicked.
I couldn't go back to jail.
who are you?
what are you doing here?
honey, call the police.
don't do that.
Hey, man, no, no, no.
then when it's all over, you put the gun in gil's hand.
thought people might assume the house was still possessed.
no.
it was you, henry, who killed that family.
it was not the devil.
you're wrong.
the devil did kill that family that night.
he came to me the day my sister died in that house.
I just didn't know enough not to let him in.
Hey, mac.
I'm trying to reach dr. Burgess who signed our vic's death certificate.
his office says he hasn't shown up for work today.
you try him at home?
no answer, but look at this address. - 40th and park.
it's less than ten blocks from where we found our vic.
it's also on the perimeter we set for the point of origin.
I'm thinking his home might be our primary crime scene.
Dr. Burgess?
NYPD. We want to have a couple words with you.
Hey, mac.
I've got dirt and blood.
I've got a faint pulse.
they're still alive.
get me a bus at 1530 west 40th street and put a rush on it.
bet I know what this is.
tetrodotoxin.
just like dexter.
makes sense now.
once dexter escaped from the coffin, he knew they left him for dead.
he wanted some answers.
looks like dexter got his answers...
and his revenge.
you think they'll survive?
depending on what the dosage was.
but for now, they're caught between the living and the dead.
fern Lazlow! NYPD!
he's really dead?
it's not a dream?
somebody get her some clothes.
you're under arrest.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and Sll be used against you in a court of law.
absolutely no defensive wounds.
placement of these knives is precise.
no other sharp force trauma.
each knife found its mark with the first strike.
we got a name.
your vic is Mitchell Bentley III.
son of everybody's favorite billionaire Mitchell Bentley Junior.
they should have stopped at two.
so this is the guy who was just acquitted of attempted murder and rape in Central Park?
one in the same, and get this:
the vic in that case, Fern Lazlow, an ER nurse over at Queen of Mercy, was seen running from this crime scene to her apartment.
we got her in custody.
when I picked her up, she had blood on her, which I'm assuming is Bentley's, 'cause she didn't have a scratch on her.
looks like a good, clean case of revenge.
she certainly made her point.
gravitational blood trails.
directionality indicates he was moving in circles.
why not just run away?
he didn't fight back, he didn't escape.
maybe he didn't have a choice.
let's get him back to Autopsy and see what Sid can tell us.
maybe he can explain how Fern Lazlow, a woman half Bentley's size, stuck four knives in his back and walked away without a scratch on her.
excuse us, folks.
any witnesses?
none.
Matt Fella, the Head of Security for the museum, found her around 6: 00 a. m. when he came in to open up.
discovered the body up here.
gun was lying right next to her.
didn't touch anything; called 911.
I checked him out, but not even a parking ticket.
seems pretty shaken up.
keys, phone, eyeliner, cash-- 250 bucks.
doesn't look like a robbery.
she hasn't been here long.
maybe a few hours.
acquire Black Card.
five grand annual fee for that thing.
quarter of a mil mandatory minimum spending.
vic's name is Joanna Morgan.
formidable Advertising Corp.
looks like somebody wasn't buying what she was advertising, huh?
smooth outer edges, no stellate tearing, no powder burns.
looks like an entrance wound.
turn her.
Oh... significant amount of tearing.
larger wound, undefined edges.
looks like an exit wound.
we've got a through and through.
was shot in the back and through the chest.
downward angle.
possible wrist fracture.
that would be consistent with being shot in the back and falling forwards.
so... our shooter could have been standing right about here...
...pointing the gun in this direction.
I got two spent shells.
we're probably looking for two rounds.
and so the bullet we're looking for should be in this area down here.
no bullet impact marks.
no indication of any rounds, even fragments of a round, anywhere in that direction.
no signs of struggle; there aren't any other injuries.
they leave the gun behind.
kind of looks like a hit.
then why can't we find any expended rounds?
I heard of, "Leave the gun and take the cannolis,
but I never heard of, "Leave the gun, takes the bullets.
all right, now, this is strange.
found high concentrations of GSR on the front of Joanna Morgan's dress, which totally contradicts Hawkes' theory that she was shot in the back, and I found GSR inside the purse, which means the GSR was transferred there from the gun.
even stranger, the only prints on the gun were hers.
it's Joanna's weapon.
so maybe the gun was fired away from the crime scene...
...and then put in the purse.
like maybe a test fire.
that's something a novice handling a gun would do, which would mean we're only looking for one round.
her gun in her hands shot at close range?
maybe this is a suicide.
in the middle of the night, on the steps at the museum?
no suicide note.
hmm. More to the point, how does an entry wound wind up looking like an exit wound?
a striking visual, the sight of those knives in this young man's back.
okay.
all of the knives penetrated deep into the torso.
they were delivered at close range with great force.
I believe this wound was inflicted first.
it devastated the postural muscles supporting the spine.
walking would have become very difficult.
standing up straight, virtually impossible.
Yeah.
your killer was very lucky, or very skilled.
the postural group is difficult to penetrate.
it took a perfect shot.
okay, so stabbing him here and here would have been easy, since he was already wounded and vulnerable.
precisely. And the result?
increased blood loss, lower blood pressure and acute pain.
these blades were barbed and difficult to extract.
this was the kill shot.
it cut deep. Another perfect strike.
transected the aorta, completely devastated the heart muscle.
he died instantly.
why not just stab him in the heart and be done with it?
I'm not sure.
but your killer has an intimate knowledge of the human anatomy.
you should be looking for someone with a medical background.
a coincidence?
bumping into a dead body, outside your apartment, who, it turns out, happens to be the same man recently acquitted of raping you?
I was coming home from the hospital.
I cut through the park.
you ran right past your doorman, covered in blood.
didn't think to ask him to call 911.
and you made no attempt to contact the police on your own.
I told you, I was upset.
but not so upset that you couldn't dispose of your bloody clothes, or take the time to try to wash away the evidence.
come on. I just wanted him off of me.
all right?
I didn't care about anything else.
not buying a word of it.
I know how this looks.
I have every reason in the world to want to kill him.
but as much as I would have loved to...
...I didn't kill Mitchell Bentley.
those are your prints.
that's from the coat you tried to dispose of.
it was found at the crime scene.
must've got caught on the fence when I fell.
how do you explain your prints on Bentley's neck, Ms. Lazlow?
I checked his pulse there.
you said you checked his wrist.
maybe I checked both. "Must have, maybe, I don't know."
prosecutor's gonna eat you alive.
a prosecutor?
is this the same incompetent ass that let that piece of garbage walk in the first place?
we're walking in circles here, gentlemen.
that's all I'm telling you until I see my attorney.
she certainly has all the answers.
when you've taken the time to plan a murder, it's very possible you've already considered all the questions.
not one print.
not from Fern or anyone else.
now, I did find traces of amino methyl propanol and methacrylate on the handles of these two knives.
you can just say "hairspray."
I can't help it.
chemical compounds just sort of roll off my tongue.
now, these are exact replicas of the knives we took from Bentley's body.
watch this.
I'm thinking our killed concealed these weapons as hairsticks.
I also found epithelial cells from a female donor on the handles of these two knives.
now, there's enough for a DNA sample.
we have no comparison sample from Fern Lazlow.
her attorney's making us jump through hoops. Yeah.
you can understand her distrust in the system.
bentley raped and stabbed Fern, and then he was acquitted.
and now his murder takes away her freedom.
well, if she is the killer, she made that choice, Stella.
she surrendered to anger instead of fighting to go on with her life.
I know, but why now?
why not two months ago?
why not six months ago?
what made her snap?
what are you thinking, Mac?
this wasn't someone who snapped.
this was planned.
methodical, calculated controlled-- in fact, I have a theory that the method of this killing is a message.
it has something to do with Spanish Style Bullfighting.
okay, you got my attention.
the knives were stuck into Bentley's body one at a time, methodically.
and those circular blood trails.
it's as if he's charging instead of running away.
in Spanish Bullfighting, the matador stands in the ring and he watches as the bull makes a series of passes.
he looks for the animal's strengths and weaknesses.
and when the time is right, he drives a knife into the thick muscles of the back.
this weakens the bull's muscles, lowers his bloopressure, and provokes angrier attacks.
almost the same as rupturing the postural muscles.
during the next phase, two barbed lances with decorative handles, like the ones found in Bentley's sides, are thrust into each of the bull's flanks.
the final stage,
the matador thrusts a sword in between the bull's shoulder blades and through the heart.
a quick, clean kill.
the planning, the pre-meditation.
now, this was torture driven from intense hatred.
nothing quick and clean about it.
brushing up on your autopsy procedures?
Ah, just confirming my suspicions.
though I hate to contradict a former colleague.
Hey, no harm, no foul, Sid.
I was making a field observation.
there's a logical explanation for Danny's finding of GSR on the front of Joanna Morgan's dress being consistent with an entrance wound, and your contradictory finding of an exit wound in the same place.
the gun was fired with the barrel pressed tightly against her skin.
rapidly expanding gases exploded out of the barrel and were forced into the space between the outer skin and the underlying tissue.
the pressure behind the gases chose the path of least resistance and pushed back out through the outer layer of skin.
made the wound larger, more jagged and similar in appearance to aexit wound.
the black dress made GSR invisible, but how could the wound in the back appear to be an entrance wound?
ah-- support behind and directly up against
Joanna Morgan's skin, where the bullet exited.
that support prevented the outer skin from expanding and tearing, more like an entrance wound.
okay, but there was nothing but concrete, glass and steel where Joanna was found.
if she was pressed up against something solid, the round would have fallen to the ground.
we didn't find it.
maybe that support was another person.
the victim had a wrist fracture.
it was a radial dislocation.
perhaps Joanna's wrist was bent violently back towards her by someone strong, likely a man. If your theory's right, our shooter was standing behind her.
find that someone, you may find your missing bullet.
Oh, uh, Sheldon, hold on.
a parting gift.
barely digested stomach contents, ingested shortly before she died.
judging by the way she was dressed, she wasn't dining alone, so this might help retrace her steps, find her killer-- thanks, Sid.
all right, well, thank you for your help, appreciate it.
that was the last one.
I've checked every hospital in the city.
no suspicious gunshot victims.
if Sid's theory's correct, and the bullet passed through Joanna Morgan and into the shooter, why would the shooter have sought medical attention?
he's afraid we'll find him. Maybe.
but there was no blood at that scene other than Joanna Morgan's.
there's no evidence of any other gunshot anywhere in front of that museum.
all we have is Sid's theory that the shooter was standing behind and up against Joanna.
maybe Sid's theory's wrong.
stranger things have happened.
but if he's not, we were looking in the wrong direction.
our search area for the bullet at the crime scene was based on Joanna being shot in the back, not the chest.
we've got to go back to the scene and look in the opposite direction.
if the shooter dodged the bullet, it still might be out there.
specimen?
he's on a cayenne pepper and lemon juice diet.
lose 20 pounds in 20 days.
some girl at a bar told him his baby fat was cute.
vanity.
thank you, Kendall.
how are we doing with the evidence?
Mm...the blood on the outside of the bandage was the vic's.
no surprise there.
I found trace and wear marks on the outside skin of the bandage consistent with it having been worn on the bottom of a shoe.
that makes me think the void on the adhesive side is part of a shoe tread print, but it's not one that's in our database.
people wear bandages on the soles of new shoes to keep from slipping.
anything else? That tiny little chad that hitched a ride along the way, it being election week, there's more than a few possibilities.
I'm looking into all of them.
good work.
what about you?
um, the fibers that Stella found on Mitchell Bentley's pants are from a black napkin.
there's three places in the area that serve black napkins, and only one of them is open late.
that place is called um...
casa del Matador? Yeah.
that's where Bentley met Fern Lazlow before he attacked her last year.
that could be our connection to Spanish Bullfighting.
that's probably where he had his last meal, too.
eat something.
they are pretty, but I dobut recognize any faces.
does this guy ring a bell?
Oh, yeah, everybody knows that bum from the news.
hard to believe he'd come back here.
was he with anyone?
a smoking hot brunette in a red dress.
she made the reservation under
I'm thinking fake name.
real sharp, Larry.
how'd they pay? Cash.
she picked up the tab.
she left a nice tip considering she was so ticked off.
ticked off at him? No.
they got along fine, but she lost something, like a contact.
never found it, didn't want any help, refused to leave a business card in case it turned up.
show me where they sat. Yeah.
she was sitting right there.
he was sitting right here.
thank you.
there's something stuck on the bottom of this chair.
yeah?
huh.
it's pretty beat up.
hard to tell what it is.
I will leave that... up to you scientists.
thank you very much.
diamond mink eyelashes.
one that Flack found at
ten grand a pair.
they stick onto your real eyelashes and they stay on for, like, two weeks.
we get a DNA profile?
nothing usable, but they're not sold in many places, so, you know, I'm looking into it.
I'd just love to know who's rich enough to lose five grand worth of eyelashes and not stick around.
someone who doesn't want to be found.
that guy look a little too interested to you?
he's probably just shaken up after finding the body.
angell said he's a boy scout.
besides, he doesn't look like he's suffering from a gunshot wound.
all right, point the gun at me.
definitely could have gone right through the love handles.
that's too low, wise ass.
okay, the trajectory angle was upward, front to back, and probably...
would you stop fighting me? Ready?
over the shoulder if it missed completely.
boom.
our ssing bullet is here somewhere.
great.
the round pillar's gonna make it hard to figure out the exact angle of trajectory from the mark.
think Mr. Boy Scout over here will let me pop off a couple rounds?
Hey, I got a better idea.
go back to the car, get the first aid kit.
okay.
it's not a Trumark double- oh-eight, but it'll do.
I can't believe you're not going to let me shoot it.
we'd be here all day.
what, did you, uh, shoot pebbles at squirrels back in Montana? No, I used to shoot boys.
now stand back and try to keep up.
now, adjusting for the decrease in velocity from the through and through, I'll recreate the trajectory.
this should give us a general search area.
boom.
Ooh, and there's our three.
the through and through from Joanna Morgan has to be here somewhere.
quite impressive.
I can't believe that contraption actually worked.
and that all three of my shots were perfect?
let's just hope this cheap piece of lead holds some valuable answers.
Hey, yo, Dennis The Menace, wait up.
the blood from the bullet we found at the museum turns out to ba mixture of Joanna Morgan's blood and the blood from an unknown male donor.
bullet went through our perp.
so it's a through and through and through and through.
exactly.
now, the angle of trajectory through Joanna Morgan is into the chest, upward, and out the back.
right, so we're looking for a suspect with a bullet hole up around his shoulder.
Ah...
here you go, Ms. Stanton.
you're not really here because I made an insurance claim on a set of diamond mink eyelashes, are you?
a man named Mitchell Bentley was murdered.
what do you know about it?
everything.
it's all over the news.
we believe you were with him last night.
I was. What was your relationship?
he's a sexual predator from a rich family who bought his way out of a conviction and I'm the publisher who was going to help him sell his story.
you have a habit of having dinner with sexual predators? Only when there's money to be made.
I thought Casa del Matador was a nice touch.
he was a little uncomfortable at first, but he loosened up after a few drinks.
things went so well, we took an after-dinner stroll.
we walked a few blocks.
I decided to catch a cab.
I left him standing at the curb very much alive.
Where'd the cab take you? To Penn Station.
from there, I took the railroad home. Would you be willing to provide a DNA sample?
absolutely not.
now, if you have a business card, please leave it with my secretary.
I've got a train to catch.
I'd keep an eye on this story. I have a feeling there's a few more chapters to be written.
and we'll keep an eye on you.
you're looking at a digitally-enhanced image of the shoe print we found on the bandage.
it's been driving me crazy.
I looked at this a hundred different ways.
I finally figured it out.
it's not like anything I've seen before.
some type of grid.
or...
...a map. What kind of shoe would have a map of the subway on its sole?
it's their trademark.
this image is actual size.
you can see the lines fit perfectly into the map.
so the bandage was stuck on the bottom of one of those shoes.
we're looking for a size six, recently purchased.
an Ian Burton boutique on West urth is the only place that sells them.
I'll get a list of buyers, last couple of months.
let's hope our killer is on that list.
four older brothers and a detective sergeant for a father?
did your old man dust you for prints when you got home from a date?
well, if it was up to them, I wouldn't have known boys existed until I was 21.
I'm sure the boys knew you existed.
was that a line, Flack?
did you just bust out your game on me?
what?
it was, wasn't it?
look at you, you're blushing.
my game. Game?
I have no game.
if I did, that's probably as good as it gets.
I think it's pretty good.
detectives.
Oh, I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
you two have been trailing me for the last couple of hours.
now, if you are going to follow me, you may as well have a copy of my itinerary.
we've got lunch at Stangs in, oh, 15 minutes.
that might be a bit expensive on your boyfriend's salary.
the rest of the day is here-- Saks, Bloomingdales...
I've got a meeting at 4: 00 in the office.
you get the idea.
and, um, I jotted down my cell phone in case you have trouble keeping up.
have a nice day.
that woman pisses me off.
what are you looking for? Something toelp me put her in handcuffs the next time I see her.
not bad for a guy on a city salary.
thank you.
Hey, Adam.
I'm comparing the DNA sample of Amber Stanton's hair, the one that Flack found in the backseat of the car, to the DNA sample recovered from the knives that Sid removed from Mitchell Bentley's back.
all right, one positive hit puts Amber in cuffs.
no match.
amber Stanton was so coy and confident.
she wanted me to know she had something to do with Bentley's murder.
I hate to say it, but all the evidence points to Fern Lazlow.
mac, hold up.
this receipt links our victim, Joanna Morgan, with your victim, Mitchell Bentley.
Joanna's name came up on a list of customers who recently purchased a pair of size six Ian Burtons.
now the only question is:
how did Joanna Morgan's shoes end up at Mitchell Bentley's crime scene?
so what do these three women have in common?
they were all victims of past sexual assault.
amber Stanton was raped seven years ago, suspect never caught.
Joanna Morgan was raped five years ago, suspect was released on a technicality.
and then there's Fern Lazlow.
she was raped by Bentley; now he's dead.
she's our prime suspect.
let's concentrate on the other two women.
amber Stanton and Joanna Morgan have a lot in common.
they're both CEOs at their own companies, they're both divorced, they both live in the suburbs in big houses, they both work in Manhattan.
Yeah, but the odd thing is they don't shop in the same stores, they don't eat in the same restaurants, they, they don't call the same people.
there's not one common phone call on their cell phone records.
this is the missing piece-- Joanna Morgan's killer.
we know he was wounded at the crime scene.
his identity will help us understand the connection between these two cases.
we also know that Bentley raped Fern Lazlow, and Amber Stanton was the last one to see him alive.
there is one piece of evidence still outstanding.
the chad that Kendall recovered from the glue on the bandage.
lots of possible sources-- she's ruled out absentee ballots, legacy punch card systems...
let's get her to rule something in.
dig into those case folders, see if you can find anything we missed. I want answers.
what's so urgent, Hawkes?
I thought we were done with Joanna Morgan's stomach contents.
we were.
Foodwise, the contents were unremarkable, but I did stumble upon a very aggressive foodborne bacteria.
I've never seen it before and it took me a good while to determine the source.
all right.
they're Brucellosis listerial bacteria cells.
they don't come along very often.
this bacteria is unique.
it allows itself to be ingested by healthy immune system cells called phagocytes.
once inside the healthy cell, the bacteria steals the internal machinery of the phagocyte, causing it to mutate.
the bacteria then hitches a free ride on the phagocyte into the digestive tract, wreaking havoc on the intestines.
so Joanna Morgan had a severe case of food poisoning. Yeah.
if she had lived, she would have become very ill, as would anyone who ate at the restaurant that night.
and would have had to seek immediate medical attention.
the hospital would have to report it to the Health Department.
which could help lead us to that someone who had dinner with Joanna Morgan the night she died, possibly our killer.
you said the healthy cells mutated.
I did.
human hairs can do the same thing.
they're the only tissue in the human body except for bone marrow that have such a high rate of mitotic activity.
and that high rate of cell division can cause a very small number of hairs to mutate, resulting in an altered DNA profile.
so maybe Amber Stanton's hair is one of those mutated hairs.
it's possible, which would explain why it didn't match the DNA on the knife that killed Mitchell Bentley.
this is... this is quite the closet, 'cause it's bigger than most living rooms in the Bronx. Detective Taylor better have crossed his "t's" and dotted his "i's when he applied for this search warrant.
my lawyer's going to have a field day.
not before we do.
where are the shoes that were in this box?
they're gone. I threw them away.
you threw away a pair of $400 shoes?
is that against the law?
why do you bother?
Mitchell Bentley was a piece of garbage.
you just don't get it, do you? It doesn't matter who the victim is; it's the killer we're after.
there's only one food poisoning outbreak that matches the bacteria you discovered in the vic's stomach contents.
it came from Kalergios Grill in Midtown.
I ran checks on the names that the Health Department sent over.
a guy named Steve Kaplan showed up in the ER at St. Vinny's with a severe case of food poisoning.
kaplan just made a big scene at the ER.
demanded prescription pain killers.
for food poisoning?
must have been more than just a bad stomach.
and get this-- Kaplan was acquitted of the 2004 murder of a model.
kaplan was Joanna Morgan's target.
he's the missing piece.
he fits the profile.
a man who got away with murder.
we need your signature, Mr. Kaplan.
so, what, you were the one who pulled me out of bed to come down here?
not bad.
we appreciate you coming down under the circumstances.
well, hey, if this paper here is gonna help me with my lawsuit against those bastards who, uh, poisoned me, where do I sign?
it's just an affidavit saying that you became ill after dining at Kalergios Grill.
says here on your rap sheet you're right-handed, Steve.
having some shoulder trouble?
whoa, whoa, whoa.
don't think about it. Don't think about it.
what do we have here?
I'm sorry, did I hurt you?
pain killers aren't prescribed for food poisoning.
you know something, I like her.
Yeah, yeah, you like her, huh?
you like her as much as you liked Joanna Morgan?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.
she pulled a gun on me, buddy.
she tried to kill me.
that's self-defense.
how did you know her?
I met her on the Internet.
she, uh, she couldn't get enough of me.
and then when I, uh, I saw her picture, I, uh, you know, I had to have her.
pay attention here, lover boy, all right?
how did you end up at the museum?
she said she liked to have sex in dangerous places.
I mean, we, uh, made it to the top of the museum steps, and, uh, she started to shake real bad.
then she turns around and she's got a gun in her hand.
she hesitates.
we struggle, the gun went off.
Hey, it's not what I had in mind for the evening, but like I said before-- self-defense.
if it was self-defense, why did you run away and not call the police?
man, who's gonna believe a guy who just beat a murder rap?
you're going to be charged with murder, Mr. Kaplan.
it will be up to your attorneys to raise a claim of self-defense.
well, well, well, well.
you guys do your job, and if my lawyer is on the ball, you'll be testifying in my defense.
I got to tl you, I really hope your lawyer does drop the ball.
Hey, do me a favor, get this moron out of my face.
this was stuck to the bandage you put on the bottom of your new shoes.
it's a chad that came from a Long Island Railroad ticket.
if I'm being charged with taking the railroad, I confess.
Couters are creatures of habit.
they... they sit in the same car.
even the same seat.
they see the same faces every day.
relationships form that can last years and never leave the train.
that's where you met... Joanna Morgan.
on the train.
you became close friends, so close, in fact, you even exchanged gifts.
so it must have really hurt to have to throw away those shoes, 'cause they were a gift from Joanna.
see, I found a piece of wrapping paper and her prints all over the box.
she was just like you, wasn't she?
beautiful, smart and happy on the outside.
scarred and angry on the inside.
you both shared the pain of being victims.
the two of you were going to avenge other victims you felt were wronged by the criminal justice system.
Joanna Morgan intended to kill
steve Kaplan and leave his body on the steps of the museum for Matt Fella to find, and got away with it.
and Amber Stanton left Mitchell Bentley's body for you to see.
she knew you worked a double aton Thursday nights.
she also knew you cut through the park.
stole a piece of my soul when he attacked me.
cutting through the park was my way of telling him that he wasn't going to steal anything else.
and I was scared.
I would hold my keys right between my fingers.
you're very brave.
why would Amber Stanton kill Bentley for me?
I suspect she did it more for herself.
your case was well publicized.
Bentley's acquittal made a lot of people very angry.
she didn't count on the fact that your instincts as a nurse would lead to circumstances that would actually incriminate you.
you don't have to say anything, Amber, that's your right.
but we have the evidence.
we matched hairs from your brush to the DNA that was on the knife that killed Mitchell Bentley, so you're going to prison.
we became instant friends, Joanna and I.
I started saving a seat for her.
excuse me.
as time went on, our conversations grew more intimate.
she confided in me about being raped.
I confided in her.
she was wonderful.
driven, smart.
she fit perfectly into my life.
a 45-minute-a-day friendship.
neither of us had the time for it to be anything more.
when did the two of you decide to become judge, jury and executioner?
whenever I see a useless piece of human trash walk away without consequence, I feel violated again.
bentley was smiling.
kaplan was going about his life as if nothing had happened.
so you became a predator, a killer.
I think of myself as an arbiter of justice.
stand up.
killing out of vengeance is not justice, Ms. Stanton.
justice is conscience.
and when you lose that, you have nothing.
"wow!" would be a really good thing to say right about now.
you don't like it?
no, no. It's, it's, it's... beautiful, but, uh, it doesn't exactly fall under the category of "let's get together for a drink sometime."
well, it's... it's not as impressive as it looks.
I'm the manager at the bistro downstairs, so I happen to know all the right people.
um, Drew, I-I just need to be very clear...
come on.
you might be able to resist me, but can you really walk away from an '82 Opus One, and a view like this?
one glass.
one glass.
my biggest heartbreak?
four years ago.
steve Bartman.
he interfered with a foul ball during the playoffs.
cubs never recovered.
it's the closest we've come to the World Series since.
Stella, I'm kind of getting the feeling here, I'm not scoring any runs.
I mean, that Steve Bartman story, that's, that's my fastball.
look, Drew, you...
you're a very charming man...
wait, before you say anything else.
I've got a mean curveball.
I... I can't accept that.
the rooftop drinks and all the gifts that you're sending to the office, it's just, you know, it's way too aggressive and not my style, and...
and you're not looking for a relationship.
uh, that's work.
I've got to go.
thanks for the drinks.
you're welcome.
you got here quick.
I was in the neighborhood.
this martini ad party goes off every Friday night around 9: 00.
Yeah, I walked by it earlier; it was going full swing.
it's the hottest ticket in town for the past two months.
tonight, the billboard was attacked.
Jenna Donovan, 21 years old.
dead in a Mirado martini.
live-wire electrocution?
from the looks of it, I'd say someone ordered Death straight up.
I'm assuming these aren't part of the ad campaign.
party crashers?
those might explain why I found several deep indentation marks on the surface of the billboard.
some of the witnesses are sporting significant bruising.
it would take quite a bit of force to cause that much damage with a tennis ball.
there were no other reports or evidence of broken windows in the surrounding buildings, and no other billboards were damaged.
so you think one of the partiers up there was the target?
flying tennis balls ain't exact deadly weapon.
maybe they were just trying to send a message.
I don't know.
but somebody out there took aim, fired and ended up killing someone.
let's find them.
the advertising business is pretty competitive.
that's one of the most coveted billboard locations in Times Square.
are you suggesting that one of your competitors might've been behin
all I'm saying is, if my billboard gets shut down, we'll have a bidding war for that space.
now, was anybody on the billboard that wasn't supposed to be there?
no, they were all models.
Damien insisted on hiring them all personally.
I'm going to need a copy of the guest list.
any threats before the party?
not tonight, not in t entire two months we've been doing this.
what's the best time to contact you in case I have any other questions?
you can contact me pretty much anytime.
I practically live here.
