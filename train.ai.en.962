nothing happened. -l know.
l'm just gonna go out on the veranda thing for a while.
where you headed? -Los Angeles.
lt's your lucky day. Come on, let's go!
l got it.
so what's in California?
a girl.
what's wrong with her? -She's got a boyfriend.
too bad.
what's she like? -Who?
your girlfriend. -l don't know. l've never met her.
you never met her.
you're going across the country to see a girl you never met.
my best friend, Lance, set it up.
supposed to be a sure thing.
a sure thing?
a sure thing, no questions asked, no strings attached
no guilt involved.
a sure thing.
my whole life, l never had a sure thing.
probably never meet her anyway. She's gonna be gone in 24 hours.
you pay for the traffic tickets, l'll get you in the saddle.
thank you. -Thanks a lot.
l hope you fully appreciate the magnitude of your impending good fortune.
l do.
Alison, where are you going?
wait up.
what is it with you?
you haven't said two words to me since Arizona.
see you around. -That's it?
see you around " ? -lsn't that what you want?
no questions asked? No strings attached? No guilt involved?
have fun with your sure thing.
l bought this for you. -l bought it!
lt's the thought that counts.
here we are.
here, let me take that from you. lt's really great to see you.
l cleared out this drawer for you.
and you can use this half of the closet.
l bought some of those hangers you like so much.
we'll just put your bags up there after you've unpacked...
get them out of the way.
lt's so good to see you.
look.
flannel sheets.
you know, the longer you use them, the softer they get.
by the time we find our farmhouse...
my goodness, they'll be incredible, won't they?
are you all right?
Yes. Great.
l guess l'm just exhausted from the trip. -Tired.
those sheets are great.
l know what you need. -What?
a good hot mug of tea.
restores both body and spirit. Let's see what we have this week.
let's see, we've got some Darjeeling...
english Breakfast.
that's more of a studying tea, isn't it?
let's see, Lapsang Souchong, for those rainy mornings.
remember that camping trip to Vermont?
of course. China Black.
how about a good hot mug of China Black?
do you have any beer?
private Gibson, incoming!
how are you doing, buddy?
how are you? -Good to see you. Looking good.
looking good. Glad you made it. Welcome to California...
home of the waves and the babes. l want you to meet some people.
guys, this is Gib, the guy l told you about. l said he'd make it.
Hey, dude. -Nice to meet you.
3, 000 miles just to get laid? l really respect that.
tonight is the night, Gib, man.
merry Christmas. -l love you.
l don't think she believes me.
why is that, man? -l don't know.
you are gonna love California. You ever make it with an avocado?
party!
gin.
let's see, that makes 25 for me...
plus...
so, 25 plus 43 is...
can l borrow that?
sorry.
there you go.
...which makes the score 233 for me...
and 8 for you.
charming.
lt sounds like someone's having a party. Let's go. lt'll be fun.
you know how we feel about parties. They're hot, loud and crowded.
the only reason anyone goes to them is to pick someone up.
now, why would we want to do that?
let's go to Disneyland. -Disneyland is for children.
let's do something pointless, something totally crazy.
all right. l tell you what. -What?
l'll spot you 50 points. That'll add some excitement to the game.
l really don't want to wear this stuff. l really don't.
what do you mean? You look fantastic. -Come with me.
what's the first thing you'll do when you meet her?
shave my head and join a Polynesian monastery.
what do you mean? -Tito. lsn't that nice?
what are you doing? -Like that?
what's going on? -l look like a moron.
what do you mean, you look like a moron? Look at me.
you don't like green? ls that it?
l'll get you blue, or the red. -l don't want anyone.
come on. -Because l don't.
what do you mean, because you don't? What is that?
you know what?
you happen to be developing a very bad attitude, young man.
don't move, because she's here.
lt's her. Look.
tonight is the first night of the rest of your sex life.
you're gonna kill me. l don't think l can go through with this.
l knew it. The breasts are too small? -Breasts are fine.
Hi, how you doing? -How are you?
this is a drink for you. -ls that him?
Yeah. -He's cute.
he's kind of going through a little climate adjustment.
and so we're gonna be with you in just a minute.
so why don't you just go over there and look for something, okay?
all right. -l love you, babe. You look good.
what's the problem? What's wrong with you?
l don't know. l'm almost 19. Maybe l'm getting too old for this.
what do you want? A goddamn relationship?
l don't know what l want.
maybe it's a moral issue. -Moral issue?
this is Lance you're talking to. You have no morals.
you're just in a slump, that's all. lt happens to the best of us.
lt could happen to me someday. l doubt it, but it could. You nervous?
get out!
you're nervous, because you haven't done it in a while.
lt's like riding a bike. You just got to climb on and keep pedaling.
and wear something white at night.
you want a relationship? That's fine.
just remember that every relationship starts with a one-night stand.
you came 3, 000 miles for a reason, didn't you?
would you look at that reason?
go for it, you've earned it.
Lance, you're right. -That's right.
l'm not being unfaithful to anyone.
hell, l could use a torrid night of cheap, meaningless lust.
that's right, buddy. There you go.
look at these people.
they probably think they're having a good time.
let's dance.
since when do you like to dance? -Since tonight.
that's a nice shirt.
from Hawaii.
lt's been a long time since l've held you like this.
l know.
lance said you were very shy around girls.
did he mention what a great dancer l am?
what else did Lance tell you about me?
he says you're a real gourmet.
and you're a virgin. -What?
he thinks you might be gay.
l didn't say it. Lance said it.
excuse me, won't you?
l have to go kick the shit out of someone. Just one second.
you told her l was a virgin? -l exaggerated a little.
girls like virgins. They find them a challenge.
you told her l was gay! -lt's a bigger challenge.
keep your shirt on, buddy, you're doing great.
excuse me. l see a sweet young thing whose sarong needs adjusting.
get out of my life.
excuse me, l'd like to get some punch.
please, allow me.
thank you. -You're very welcome.
she's got lovely skin, and so much of it.
she happens to be an excellent judge in quality shirt wear.
she should try wearing one, sometime.
would you like a cup for Justin? -Jason.
whatever. He probably eats paste. -Justin's twice the man you'll ever be.
he's loyal, he's trustworthy-- -Housebroken?
do you know this person?
not really.
would you like a drink? -No, thank you.
Jason, let's go to bed.
careful, she hogs all the blankets.
you snore. -Not tonight, l won't.
l'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
how would you like to go up to Lance's room for a drink?
all right.
let's go.
good night.
he doesn't even know that girl! -How do you know that guy?
lt was all set up by his friend.
he thinks love is something you order on the phone, like a pizza!
how do you know he snores? -He thinks he knows all about stars.
he doesn't know Cassiopeia's the mother of Andromeda.
how's he know you hog the blankets? -The crap he eats...
cheese balls and beer for breakfast!
how do you know what he eats for breakfast?
come on in.
want to sit down?
do you want me to? -Why don't you sit down?
all right.
do you want a drink? -Sure.
great.
Thanks.
that's strong.
lance sure does drink a lot of beer.
a lot of it's imported.
are you all right? -l'm fine. Why, don't l look fine?
l don't know, it just seems like-- -l'm not.
ls it that girl at the punch bowl? -No.
lt's nothing. Particularly not that girl at the punch bowl.
why didn't you tell me about him?
because he's not worth mentioning. He's a creep.
you made love to him, didn't you?
did you make love to him? -No.
honest? -Honest.
do you love him?
l have to go to the library. l'm really behind.
that's what l should've done. l didn't study all this week.
me, neither.
want some?
good morning, everybody.
you're gonna have to talk to me sooner or later.
no, thank you. -All right. Here we go.
l've got a very pleasant surprise today. Comes from an unlikely source.
lt is called The Sure Thing.
lt could be tonight,' he thought...
as he stood in the corner, pretending to have a good time.
he would meet her tonight.
all his young life, he had dreamed of a girl like this.
5'6 " , silky hair...
trim, nubile body... "
nubile, " by the way, is spelled with a " u. "
...nubile body that really knew how to move...
and soft, deeply tanned skin.
now, as for personality traits, she needed only one.
she had to love sex, and all the time.
to arrive at this moment, he had traveled vast distances...
enduring many hardships:
abject poverty, starvation...
show tunes, you name it.
from across the room he saw her. She was perfect.
he knew almost nothing about her, and she didn't know much more about him.
lt was exactly how it was supposed to be. He brought her to his room.
the lights were soft, the moment was right.
then she leaned over and whispered in his ear:
do you love me?'
thoughts raced through his mind. Did she really want him?
what had he done to deserve this bounty? Does God exist?
who invented liquid soap, and why?
do you love me?' Staring into her eyes...
he knew that she really needed to hear it.
but for the first time in his life, he knew these were no longer just words.
and if he said it, it would be a lie.
do you love me?' she whispered. 'Do you love me?'
lt would not be tonight.
the answer was 'no. " '
he was a traitor!
you didn't sleep with her?
still seeing Jason?
we broke up.
that's too bad.
you didn't sleep with her.
she wasn't my type.
never know how to answer that.
Yeah, I have enough money.
but, you know, I like working in tech support.
may I? - Sure.
you should bring Sylvia here. It's so romantic.
you know, she's planning this library fundraiser.
she's busy. - Call her.
it's hard to be alone.
well, maybe her husband will come back. - Maybe.
Jane Austen should write that.
she did. In Persuasion.
Anne Eliot is in love with this guy Wentworth who's in the navy, right?
but her family thinks that he's not good enough.
right. - So he leaves.
and when he comes back he's become this wealthy man.
but he's no longer in love with her. - Okay. Don't tell me any more.
Oh, so you're enjoying the Austen, I see. - Yeah. And how's the Ursula Le Guin?
you didn't like Le Guin? - I didn't read them.
how are you gonna know what you like unless you try?
I think at my age I should know what I like.
age? Come on, age.
age has nothing to do with anything.
I was willing to read girly books like Jane Austen...
she is not girly.
which I found out.
so maybe you would find out that science fiction's not just...
aliens on rocket ships. - Right.
all right, hurry up and finish. I'm gonna show you something really cool.
what you have to understand is that when I was a kid, my dad and I were basically surrounded by girls .
you know, there was my mom, my sisters, and their friends.
so there'd be like 15 girls in the house. It was insane.
my dad would hide out in the shed and no one was allowed back there.
and he'd listen to ballgame, you know, smoke his pipe.
he actually died a couple years ago of mouth cancer.
I'm so sorry. - Anyway, one day...
I'm like 10 years old, my dad takes me back to the shed and he shows me some magazines that he keeps back there.
he says, "This is strictly guy stuff. It's top secret. Very private.
tell no one.
Yeah, so from then on, it's like...
I don't know... It's like me and my dad and science fiction.
these were like the first books that I fell in love with, and I never got over it.
Arthur C. Clarke. He's a visionary writer.
theodore Sturgeon. Amazing.
philip K. Dick. This was my top-secret all-guy world.
Andre Norton. - Very manly.
except, as it turns out, Andrew Norton, a. k.a. Andre Norton, - a. k.a. Alice Mary Norton. - No way.
James Tiptree, Jr. - I heard of him.
real name, Alice Sheldon. Pat Murphy.
Patrice Anne... - You were still surrounded.
but by that time I liked girls.
you win. I'll read the Le Guin.
great.
tell me a secret. - Your turn.
no. You have better secrets. You can trust me.
tell me.
okay, but this is not something I would tell anyone else.
there was this special needs kid in the grade above me, Benny.
he wore his hat squashed down really low, and his ears stuck out.
and he was always carrying around this basketball and going...
and, one day, I was in fourth grade,
I saw that he was holding his penis.
so, I just went back to my friends.
well, later my dad picked me up.
and he was distracted, just not really listening, and...
and I don't know why, but...
I said, "Dad, this boy at school made me look at his penis.
wait. What was his name? - Benny.
we actually got their address and drove to their house.
and Benny's mom answers the door. I mean, she was old.
she has these two long, skinny gray braids. And my dad's yelling.
and she starts crying. "I'm sorry, what do you expect me to do?
and he says, "I expect you to speak to your son.
and then right behind her is Benny with his stupid basketball, going...
and my dad just stops.
cause he had a little brother like that who died.
Oh, my God.
so we get back in the car and my dad is just silent.
and then he says, "I think you knew "you were leaving out the most important part.
and I just felt horrible.
you know, I didn't really know any of that was gonna happen.
I just wanted his attention.
have you lost your mind?
I thought about... I thought about calling.
I... But I didn't wanna wake you. - You can't just show up here, Daniel.
somebody's gotta mow the lawn. I don't mind.
well, I'll pay somebody.
you know? I mean, this is my home. You cannot just arrive here without asking.
what if I had somebody staying over?
are you seeing someone? - Put the mower away.
I didn't mean that in a weird kind of way.
I just missed hearing what's going on here.
Allegra, she acts like she hates me, and the boys... I mean, Diego and Andy, they call from school, but they don't say much.
they're ashamed of their father.
so Diego says you told him the handle on the shower's loose?
thirty seconds. - I'll deal with it.
is there something in the house you don't want me to see?
do you think I'm not taking care of the house?
no, no... - You wanna do what a husband does?
you wanna fix things?
you can't fix this.
you're not my husband.
all that's gone now. - Can I call you next weekend?
no, you cannot call me next weekend. - Okay.
I'll check in with you, okay?
my mom said I could buy a motorcycle if I paid for it myself.
it's her one stipulation, right?
so I work at the mall.
and I have that whole Kerouac thing planned for this summer, and now it's, "No.
I'm 18 years old. I have the right to buy a motorcycle.
but you had a motorcycle once.
and you ended up hating it.
remember, Trey?
remember? You used to park it on the other side of the gym.
it was red and black. And...
you got really tired of taking care of it.
What're you talking about?
that was my mom's technique when I wanted something.
she'd say, "But you had a birthday party last year."
remember? We had a big cake with pink icing and roses all over it.
and you hated it.
and she was totally messing with you?
it got her out of giving me a birthday party. - Wow.
I mean, I have wonderful memories of balloons and ballerinas and rollercoasters.
and it never happened. That's pretty messed up.
we certainly can't have a big party like that every year, can we?
so, when did you finally figure it out?
well, by then she had this other trick.
so suggest something to me. Something you'd like to do.
okay. Um...
let's get a room.
let's not get a room and just say we did.
then we give up?
you weren't a very persistent kid, were you?
Trey, you really shouldn't come on to me. - Why?
because you're a teacher?
I... We can't do this.
let's get out of here.
we'll go back to my place. We'll just talk.
let's not and just wish we did.
I don't wanna pretend.
um, we're late.
just give me a second.
God.
does this place seem creepy? - It's quiet.
wow, Sylvia, you look great! - Hottie!
it's the new me.
Hey, how's Corinne doing? - Great.
so, are we up for Grigg's amazing insights on Northanger Abbey?
stop it. He might surprise you.
I hope his couch has arrived. - Oh, I don't mind sitting on the floor.
passing around cans of aerosol cheese? - Stop it. Fine.
Grigg is a grownup. I'm sure he's made it very nice.
all right.
welcome. Please come in.
whoa. - Grigg? Whoa!
apparently, he thinks it's Hallowe'en.
no, it's Northanger Abbey! It's Gothic! - Right!
no one gets out alive!
I don't like this. I don't like this. - Sylvia, Sylvia!
Grigg? Grigg? Grigg? - Sylvia, it's a joke.
he's just having fun... - Oh, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia!
it's okay. It's all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
look. - It's a send-up of Northanger.
it's a program. - Bernadette, that's your phone.
this is my remote. And everything's on sensors.
Prudie? Oh, hi, Dean. Is Prudie running late?
what do you do on Hallowe'en? - Oh, Hallowe'en is big.
Hallowe'en is much, much bigger. You should come over for Hallowe'en.
wait. - Oh, that's terrible.
I got inspired reading The Mysteries of Udolpho.
you know, the book in Northanger Abbey that Catherine's obsessed with reading?
you read The Mysteries of Udolpho? - Food!
Hey, Grigg, that color almost works. - When did you...
he read The Mysteries of Udolpho. - Wow.
wait, that book they were reading in the book? That's a real book?
Yeah, with the black veils and Laurentina's skeleton.
didn't you think that sounded great? - Yeah, it sounded awesome.
Dean, I'm so sorry. Prudie must be devastated.
Prudie said to ask you.
she's supposed to talk or something, about some book?
persuasion.
we don't know how long we're gonna be down in San Diego, so...
she may have to cancel.
tell her we'll save Persuasion for the end.
it's better to do it last, anyway. It was Austen's final book.
I thought Northanger Abbey was the final book.
written first. Published last. - That makes much more sense.
Why? - What happened with her?
cause it's a novel about novels.
you know? You see Austen as the young writer, questioning herself.
who's a heroine? What makes a good story?
are novels a waste of time? Am I gonna write? What should I write about?
I like that. - That's actually very perceptive, Grigg.
Thanks.
Prudie's mother died.
what? - Jesus.
she got into her car yesterday, this was in San Diego.
she made a left coming out of a parking lot into oncoming traffic.
Jesus. - Terrible.
were Prudie and her mom close? - Well, there was tension.
what do we think? Is Persuasion too depressing to take on right now, with the dead mother and everything?
she doesn't die on the page.
even Sense and Sensibility, the dad dies.
what about Pride and Prejudice?
I could use a little encounter in the woods with Mr. Darcy right now.
are we all up for a little romance? - Ready.
I think we're all overdue. And it'll be better for Prudie.
I still can't believe you read The Mysteries of Udolpho, Grigg.
Bravo, Grigg. Bravo. - Yay for the grilled artichokes.
you can move in with us any time, Grigg. - Please, don't bring skeletons.
she loves these.
are you and Grigg seeing each other?
no. He's interested in Sylvia, obviously. That was the plan, right?
I don't wanna fight, okay?
I don't know why you didn't just take her back to the car and have sex with her. I mean, clearly you wanted to.
I talked to her... I talked to her for like five minutes.
longer. Longer, Dean.
and with those ridiculous plastic boobs. Is that what you go for?
Prudie, you know, I was just trying to be nice to your friend.
okay. Chloe Baher is not my friend, Dean.
Chloe Baher came to my mother's funeral to gloat. "Ha-ha! Your mother's dead.
and you hit on her!
I do... I do... - You hit on her!
I was not hitting on her.
you know, when I was in the 10th grade,
I wrote an entire paper on Julius Caesar in iambic pentameter.
and Chloe Baher removed it from my locker and she read it aloud to the whole class.
and everyone laughed at me.
baby, high school's over.
high school's never over.
and turning 'round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth "till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said," "She is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me."
I am in no humor at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, "'for you are wasting your time with me."'
you know, I don't know if we can do Pride and Prejudice next week, because it's the library dinner.
well, we need to go for Sylvia. Daniel's bringing Pam.
that's so unnecessary. - Tell me about it.
his firm's buying a table. - Well, then we should buy one.
all of us, the book club.
show up in force. - Yes.
the Central Valley River City All Jane Austen, All The Time Book Club,
is what Grigg calls it.
he's so funny. I'm so glad he finally made a date with Sylvia.
he's taking her to lunch.
I sure hope there's some dancing in this thing.
I'm trying to diet.
my husband is bringing a date to my fundraiser.
Yeah, re-reading Pride and Prejudice again,
I keep thinking, "You know, courtship is easy."
Where's Austen's novel on divorce? - I wouldn't say it was easy.
depends who you're courting, I guess.
does Jocelyn ever go out with anyone? - Occasionally.
she used to date my husband in high school.
then she sort of gave him to me.
Daniel's the one that first bought Jocelyn a dog.
she traded your husband for a dog? - Look, I adore Jocelyn, but...
if loving is letting go, then whoever wants Jocelyn is going to have to pry her fingers loose, one by one.
Hey. - Hi.
Hey.
do you know Lynne from my writing group?
I don't, actually. Allegra. - Hey.
listen, I just have to say, you have been so good for Corinne.
ever since you two have been together, she's been writing nonstop.
didn't you just love that story that she wrote last week?
well, Allegra and I don't discuss what I'm working on.
okay.
dear Ms. Corinne Mahern, we regret that we must decline to publish the three short stories you sent us.
Benny's Basketball is strong narratively, but the depiction of your penis-waving retarded boy felt a little unkind.
and isn't the title "Separating Eggs For Flan" a bit obvious as a metaphor for your parents' divorce?
yet we confess that "Skydiver" puzzled us most.
why would a beautiful, self-centered young lesbian jump out of a plane?
I thought we could drive together.
we should hurry. I don't want Sylvia sitting there alone.
sahara, off. - Sylvia's already at the library.
she said she had to get there early. - So you offered her a ride first.
no, she happened to mention it at lunch.
that's a great dress.
stay.
I converted it to biodiesel. So it basically runs on donut grease.
this is so great. I never get to drive it.
or vacuum it, apparently.
I like your hair.
you need to dance with Sylvia tonight.
you do know how to dance, don't you? - Of course I do.
I have three older sisters. I can dance.
wait, if we stay in this lane, we're gonna be late.
given that I have to convert donut grease into biofuel every time I fill up the tank, I just try not to drive very fast.
we're barely moving.
you ever read those Le Guin books I bought you?
I prefer books about real people.
okay, so Elizabeth Bennet is real and people in science fiction aren't.
is that it?
science fiction books have people in them, but they're not about the people.
real people are complicated.
well, there's all kinds of science fiction.
when you've read some, I will be interested in your opinion.
why are you getting off here? - I enjoy seeing the river.
what are you, Mark Twain?
now we're gonna get stuck at every light.
look at the talent in this room.
half the Silicon Valley is here.
to romance.
Hi. - Hello.
I'm planning on meeting a software baron and moving to Pemberley.
well, everyone knows a rich man is eventually going to want a new wife.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm Dean.
Yeah, he's not doing book club with us.
uh, moral support. She's had a rough couple of weeks.
well, you're welcome to join in, Dean. - Nah, that's okay.
I think I'll just head to the bar. Let you ladies talk.
there is no bar. It's a library.
serving liquor. - Well, that'll work.
you guys need anything?
we had this big fight on the way over here.
have some champagne. - Mom?
I broke up with Corinne.
Oh, my God. Honey.
nice. - We have plenty of time.
honey, whatever happened between you and Corinne, you don't just walk out.
you don't even know what she did. - Did she hit you?
did she say cruel things?
you are so quick to love. You're too quick.
you jump in, you jump out. That's Daniel in you. Quick to act.
it's not working? Well... Fix it. Or break it. Who cares?
we don't just dispose of people we love. You stay. You repair.
okay, you know what? This is not you and Daddy.
this is Corinne. The difference being that Daddy actually loves you.
so you go repair. Power on.
maybe Daddy'll give up this woman he's been fucking.
Allegra. - But Corinne, I'm dumping the bitch.
we're gonna be so late. - I'll call a cab.
I will not let Sylvia be alone when Daniel walks into that library with Pam.
you got your phone?
I'll find a payphone.
are you attracted to Sylvia?
Yeah, she's, um... She's nice.
she's more than nice. She's smart and funny...
and she's in love with her husband. - Well, she needs to get over that.
why don't you stop interfering? Let Sylvia work out her own life.
it's interfering to want my best friend to be happy.
if that's interfering, I hope I never stop.
what about me? Am I your friend?
or am I just some widget to help you make Sylvia feel better about herself?
why did you invite me to be part of your book club?
what went through your mind the first time you saw me?
there's a man who is dying to read every book Jane Austen ever wrote.
is that what you thought? - No.
but I thought, "What a beautiful woman. I hope she looks over at me."
I thought if I read your favorite books that you would read mine.
but, no, no, no. You just wanna be obeyed.
that's why you have dogs.
for such a famously romantic story,
pride and Prejudice is a parade of bizarre marriages.
I've had every marriage in this book.
my first husband was a politician. He was embarrassed by every move I made.
he said I was rude and loud.
"stop pointing your breasts everywhere," he'd say to me.
I was 17. I was Charlotte Lucas.
I married the first man who looked at me.
you don't see your own marriage until it's too late.
so, um... I actually thought that Charlotte Lucas was gay.
really, I think that when she tells Lizzie she's not as romantic as she is,
I think that's what she means.
Charlotte Lucas is not gay. She's not. She just... She just has no options.
wait. Austen meant Charlotte to be gay or Charlotte is gay and Austen is not aware of it?
I just love the idea of a character having a secret life that the author doesn't even know about.
you know, frankly, I kind of admire Charlotte for looking at her situation and deciding to marry Mr. Collins.
I mean, yes, yes, she knows he'll never be the love of her life,
but that's okay.
that is exactly the reason that Jocelyn would hate her.
Jocelyn has contempt for anyone who settles for anything less than the perfect love.
you know, it's probably why Jocelyn has never married.
my apologies, everybody.
hello. - Hi.
we ran out of donut grease.
Grigg Harris. - Dean Drummond.
wait, Grigg... Grigg from the book club? - Yeah.
no, it's just Prudie would say "Grigg," and I just didn't picture it as a guy.
so you thought Grigg was a girl?
Dean thinks "Austen" is the capital of Texas.
Wow.
you'll notice that Jane, she never shows what happens after the wedding.
maybe Elizabeth and Darcy start hating each other.
maybe Lizzie went off to Pemberley, and she turned into this crazy person, like her mom, because our mothers are like time bombs.
they just... They tick away inside of us.
let's not give Mrs. Bennet more importance than she deserves.
you know, I mean, what about the father? - What father?
you know, my mom showed me a picture of a guy in uniform.
well, maybe she made him up.
or maybe she bought it at a garage sale.
and I kept it in my room, this...
I kept it in my room.
let's not do this now, okay?
Dean, I got it.
Bernadette.
Daniel never came.
good.
I'm in love with one of my students.
but I mean, nothing's happened. Much.
but it could.
it could, if I let it.
I fantasize about him constantly.
sweetie, your mother died. This is grief.
he looks at me like he's the spoon, and I'm the dish of ice cream.
it's a good thing we're reading Sense and Sensibility next.
I love you so. - But how can you be sure in just one day?
I do not know. 'Tis just when a lass falls in or out of love, she knows it right away.
you think you're in love with me? - Think?
what good does thinking do but what I feel is something else?
Hey, you got your cast off. - Yeah.
how does it feel? - Great.
you can reach it. Just really stretch your arm out.
there you go. Just give the rope a little bit of a shake.
you can do it, there... Can you put your...
can you put your right foot in that blue thing?
it's gonna be fine.
here, hang on. - You can reach it.
just reach up. - It's caught.
it's okay. You're doing good.
I'm totally okay. I'm not even hurt. It's nothing.
I'm sorry, I have to stop you here.
it's not likely to be anything more than a concussion.
I'd like to keep Allegra under observation for a few days, okay?
and if you need to reach me, I'm Dr. Yep.
how many times have we had to come here to get her stitched up?
it's always Allegra, never the boys. - Well, she's the one who goes mountain climbing and skateboarding and snowboarding.
it's a miracle she never tried parachuting.
she's so extreme.
one minute she's crazy in love with Corinne, the next minute she's never hated anybody more.
she's gonna be okay, right? - She's fine.
she just took a knock on the noodle.
this is gonna sound, probably, horrible, considering the fact that she's got this lump on her head, but... It's just...
it's great to have us all in the same room again.
just feels so normal.
normal, yeah.
you know, I haven't been seeing Pam for a couple of months now.
so, that must be a big change.
you know, I was thinking just this morning about this book club that we're in, Allegra and me.
the first meeting was...
Yeah, we had just been separated. 'Cause Allegra had just moved in.
and I was realizing how different I feel.
I don't think I'm the same woman that you left.
I can see that. I so see that.
well, it's probably the same for you.
I guess that's what happens when you let go.
we did a good job taking things apart.
I'm kind of proud of us.
I'm warning you, if Grigg starts making little remarks, I'm gonna walk out.
you two just keep it together for one more book.
I wish he'd just drop out of the group.
Austen sets up this juicy triangle between Elinor, Edward and Lucy Steele.
and then at the end, she practically has to whip a rabbit out of a hat to make Lucy Steele run off with Edward's brother?
Yeah, that requires some hand-waving. - I think the ending's well-plotted.
to me, the part that seems forced is Marianne ending up with Colonel Brandon.
anyone else feel that? - Oh, I have no problem with that.
he rides up on a big stallion, sweeps her into his arms. I'm there.
from the time Colonel Brandon meets Marianne, he just lavishes all this attention on her.
and meanwhile, she's throwing herself at Willoughby.
Willoughby is a player.
women never go for the nice guy.
please. Men say that, but you get to know some of these men who complain the most, you find out they're not as nice as they like to think they are.
okay. You know what struck me?
is that Colonel Brandon is only a few years younger than Mrs. Dashwood.
well, why does he take up with the daughter and not the mother?
Yeah, why not Mrs. Dashwood?
maybe Mrs. Dashwood won't give him the time of day.
the book is about the young people. - Yeah, because Jane Austen thinks that nothing interesting can happen to a woman over 25.
when actually, a novel about a woman seducing a slightly younger man just yields so much more.
well, then maybe Mrs. Dashwood should go for Willoughby.
why not?
it's a long, hot summer.
maybe Mrs. Dashwood has more sense than that.
okay, can I just point out, she's hardly in the story.
sex is messy.
maybe Mrs. Dashwood prefers a more well-ordered life.
maybe that's why she's such a minor character.
I think if you read Austen's novels... - Oh, I have.
you wanted me to, and I did.
I think you'll see she always writes in favor of order and self-control.
nothing unwise. - Nothing in haste.
okay, so, this is... This is what, this is a rulebook?
we could do worse.
I think Jane Austen wrote about women falling in love because she was Ionely.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong.
Austen lived a very full life. She could've gotten married anytime.
she almost did. - That's right.
but she decided not to. - Why, too messy? Too out of control?
his name was Harris Bigg-Wither, and they were engaged for one night.
Oh, Harris Bigg-Wither! I can't believe you know that.
I understand why Colonel Brandon goes for Marianne.
and it's not 'cause she's young.
it's because she's generous with herself.
she's willing to risk her heart. No rules, no fear.
and Willoughby tramples her. - She just picked the wrong guy.
no rules, no fear.
I like that.
Hi. - You're wearing that to your book club?
it's Bernadette's idea to do this beach day, 'cause in the novel they all go to Lyme, which is, you know, like, the beach in England.
this is your last one, right?
I think we're gonna do some more books after this one.
Prudie's gonna be hours late and Grigg called. He's bringing a woman.
thank God it's the last meeting.
Yes, there's getting to be a little too much plot.
not that I blame Grigg.
something about reading Austen sort of makes you wanna get it on.
Hi.
started reading it with Allegra at the hospital. This is a great book.
are you joining our discussion?
am I? 'Cause I'd like to. - Hi.
Daniel wants to join us. - Well he's not in the club, is he?
Oh, come on, this is my favorite Austen. So far.
it's all about mistakes and second chances.
Yeah, you can stay.
glass of wine?
I can't believe he brought a date to our last meeting.
I kinda had him in mind for you, as a fling. - For me?
honey, I took your boyfriend away from you in high school.
look how that turned out.
Hi. - Hey.
how ya doing? - Guys, this is Cat.
hello. - I'm Grigg's big sister.
Oh, God, that's wonderful. That's so... I'm... God, that's wonderful.
you're Grigg's sister. I'm Jocelyn. This is Sylvia.
how are you? - Hi.
good, thank you. - Hi. Bernadette.
I don't believe it. - Look at you!
you look great. - Good to see you.
thank you.
wow, are you visiting from Idaho? - Yeah, yeah.
we kept seeing these emails. And we said, "What kind of strange power do these women have that they got Grigg to read Jane Austen?"
just thought I'd check it out. You wanna take a walk?
well, sure.
excuse me.
Bernie! Mom! Hey. Hey!
Hi. - Dr. Yep?
Samantha. Thank you for inviting me.
I'm sorry we're late. - Oh. Yeah. Well, Prudie's not even here yet.
is that Dad?
let's say hi. - Okay.
a doctor.
nothing in haste.
dad! Hi! - Hey.
would you do me a favor?
would you read this?
please. Right now.
isn't that what your special little book club's for?
I really want you to read it.
please, Dean.
it doesn't... They don't...
Prudie, I feel like you want me to be something that I'm not.
I just walk around being me. I don't pretend to be anything else.
I'm the guy who thinks "Austen" is a city in Texas.
I shouldn't have said that. That was mean.
you just set me up for a test that you don't want me to pass.
no, no. This is not a test.
this is something to share.
why don't you just tell me what it's about?
it's about these two people who used to love each other.
and they don't anymore.
and it's how they persuade themselves to give it another try.
look, I can get you started off. Okay?
sir Walter Eliot... - Prudie.
of Kellynch Hall in Somersetshire was a man who...
for his own amusement, never took up any book but the...
come on, you're really not gonna read all of this out loud.
one page.
there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one.
come on. - So I've been trying to figure out that moment in Persuasion when Wentworth and Anne just began to stop hating each other.
maybe it's when they went with everyone to Lyme.
after Louisa Musgrove fell.
after Wentworth used her to make Anne jealous.
you think he was using Louisa?
Yeah. That's one interpretation.
I think the guy was just trying to feel... - Valued again.
it was a bonehead move.
I mean, he knows he's nothing without Anne.
he loved her then, he loves her now.
I like how Austen always lets the men explain themselves.
Darcy writes a letter to Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, and Frank writes to Emma.
Yeah, in Persuasion, everything hangs on Wentworth leaving her that note - when everybody's talking all around them. - Yeah. Yeah. Sneaky.
no, smart guy. Perfect timing.
Yeah.
let us never underestimate the power of a well-written letter.
Grigg has always loved dogs.
you know, we were never allowed to have one when we were kids.
dogs and books. That's our Grigg.
okay, he'd kill me for saying this, but my brother likes you.
I'm figuring he'll never tell you. And this way it's up to you.
my sisters and me, I wouldn't say we ruined him, but he's just way too considerate to make the first move.
Hey. - Hey.
I was just wishing that Austen had written a bunch more books, you know?
I'm gonna miss this.
all of the ladies were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight, excepting Louisa.
she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.
she was safely down and instantly, to show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.
he advised her against it, but no...
shoot.
I'm so sorry. I should've called first. I read these books.
I love them.
I couldn't stop reading.
I went to the all-night newsstand on State Street to buy Searoad, the next one, - but they didn't have it, and... - Do you wanna borrow Searoad?
I mean, I have... You know, there...
there are other writers that you might like.
Hey.
Hi, honey.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
wait, wait, wait.
Hey, has anyone read those Patrick O'Brian novels?
british Navy. - Yeah. Jane Austen's navy, 1805.
Yeah. But aren't there, like, 20 of them?
there's more of us now. - I'm in.
Oh, my God, is that Bernadette? - I thought she was in Costa Rica.
buenas noches, everyone. This is Senor Obando.
Hola. - Hello.
hello. - He's working on his English.
I'm working on my Spanish. - Hello.
and so far I have te amo.
and mi esposo.
Oh, my God! - Congratulations!
that's incredible! - That's incredible. Congratulations!
Oh, it's gorgeous. - Thank you.
I'm so happy for you. - Congratulations.
dad, check it out. - Well, let's get you a drink, Mr. Darcy.
don't be gone too long. - Yikes. That makes seven.
what? - Yeah.
Hey, guys. Guys.
he hasn't read a word of Austen.
Oh, poor man.
Ah, yeah. We'll fix that.
Cheers! - Cheers!
I... guess. Sure. Whatever.
is everything ok? - Yeah.
something is going on with your son...
...and I'd like to talk to you about it.
ever since the science fair... But really even before that.
Yes, I know, I... I've been feeling the same thing.
there's something I'd like to show you.
uh, what is this?
uh, this is a Tibetan painting. It's called up mandala.
it's a symbolic representation of the universe.
this one's actually almost 1, 000 years old.
well, it's... beautiful...
but why are you showing it to me?
these were drawn by your son.
Noah drew these?
amazing.
when I saw Noah's drawings...
...they really struck a chord.
now especially this one...
...which is particularly rare.
Yeah, this is actually an astrological configuration.
the books says it's a map to the past and future.
um, in Tibet, uh...
they believe that there are extraordinary children...
...with this very special knowledge...
and... And abilities.
uh, they are considered actually very rare souls.
very gifted, like Noah. They're called tolkus.
and then they even have a particularly...
uh, specific means of identifying these children...
markings, on their hands.
palm readers can look at their lines...
and tell if they're one of these special beings.
we met some of these kids and I actually had the honor...
...of being able to look at their palms, which was...
Naomi studied with a palm reader for several years.
she's really... She's quite good.
Larry... Thank you. - No, I mean you are.
well... You're very gifted. So...
can she look at mine?
honey, what are you doing here?
I couldn't help it, I... I wanted to look.
will you?
uh, well I'm... I'm not actually an expert...
mom, please.
uh... I'm sorry...
I just don't believe in all of this stuff.
I know it sounds really weird...
but there are many cultures that take this very seriously.
OK.
let's see.
do you see anything?
this is a very good hand.
really.
this is what lamas would call auspicious.
meaning that you will have a very good life.
but is it special?
it's very special in its own way.
it's just not what I was, uh, talking about before.
what about mine?
um... Would...
OK.
what is it? What's wrong?
huh, this is a... A very special hand.
do you see how simple the lines are?
I've never seen anything so pure.
what does it mean?
it means you have a remarkable child.
do you have a copy machine?
we need to find some way to document this.
maybe we could show it to some people?
uh, no, sorry, I don't.
mom, sure, you do.
no, I'm sorry. Look, uh...
I, just... This is all starting to feel...
...Too strange for me.
it's been so strange for both of us as well.
I'd just like you to stop.
thank you for your time. We should go, I think.
Thanks.
that's a very cute bunny.
she's Mimzy, she's my teacher.
she teaches me everything.
she taught me about the painting and the book.
she told me it was called the 7 mountains.
my daughter has a very active imagination.
Oh, come on.
that's not what it's called, is it?
...the recent mysterious blackout...
...are now zeroing in on Seattle...
...as the likely source.
and in other news, 40 are dead...
Hey, why don't you, uh, come to bed?
no, I... I'm not tired.
you gotta... You gotta stop thinking about this stuff...
you really do. - No, I can't!
David, the lines on their hands...
I've never noticed them before.
all right, look, we... We...
I mean, what do you know about palmistry?
this woman, she could've told you anything.
how would you know? - Emma knew the painting!
she knew what it was called. It's just not possible.
I mean, I think you're just making way too much out of it.
Oh, David, you said that we'd get help now.
all right, what are we gonna tell a doctor?
our kids have funny lines in their hands...
...and they make weird drawings?
I just don't... I don't buy any of this stuff, you know.
I don't understand.
what do you mean?
but I don't want the world to end...
ever.
I love the world.
I don't want it to die.
I know. I know.
with all my heart.
I love you so much.
good morning, everybody. - Hey.
morning - Hi.
can i get you something? - No, no. No. No.
I got it. I got it.
it's fine.
dad, you're eating breakfast at home.
Yes, I thought it would be nice to join you. Why not?
whoa, take it easy there on the sugar.
but dad, I always have this much.
Hey, Noah, stop.
Hey, Noah...
where are your glasses? How come you're not wearing them?
don't worry about it, it's ok.
Noah, go and get your glasses.
I don't need them.
of course you do, now go and get your glasses.
mom, lighten up.
Noah, come on, now, don't talk to your mother that way.
do what she said. - Oh, but dad, I-I'm...
no, do what she said, go get your glasses, ok?
I think Mimzy's sick. - What's that?
I think Mimzy's sick.
can you tell? Something's wrong.
she's getting weaker.
I'm afraid she's going to die.
she's a stuffed animal, Emma.
now, you gotta...
you know, stop it with this Mimzy stuff.
OK, here's what I'd like you to do.
I'd like you to just...
put Mimzy away, put the rabbit away, all right?
so that we can have a really great breakfast together.
Emma, put the rabbit away.
what is wrong with this family? I mean it's not...
look, I want you to put the rabbit away, ok?
all right? Just...
could you pass the sugar?
dad, you don't need that much sugar!
and all of a sudden, I kind you not...
...the sugar starts to rise by itself up...
...it forms this pattern, and it comes over...
...and all of it lands in my bowl.
now, I looked at her and she's just smiling.
very, very peacefully, just looking at it.
and, I mean, wh-what is this?
this is so far out of my league.
I...
I've heard of...
psychokinesis being practiced by advanced meditators before...
...but I always thought it was just a metaphor.
no, come on, this is not a metaphor...
...we're dealing with, it's way beyond metaphor at this point.
it's not... - And I'm sorry that I was...
...just so dismissive the other day.
it was just that all of this is so beyond...
...and we...
we just don't know where to turn.
so we called you because we thought that...
...maybe it could be related to Noah's drawings...
...and the paintings in the book.
uh, we... We just don't know what to do.
I have a friend, Arnie Rose.
he's a neurologist at northwest hospital.
um...
maybe there's some kind of connection...
scientific, medical or otherwise.
we could have him... see your kids.
Yes, that's a very good idea.
Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely.
all right, we should get the...
we... We should get the kids, where are the kids?
they're upstairs. - Right, so what we should do...
help! - What is it?!
mom, dad, it's Emma!
we need you!
Mr. Wilder, should we come?
what is it, Noah?! - Emma?
Hi, mommy.
I learned this from Mimzy too.
Emma! - Mommy, please, it's all right.
OK.
now I... I need you to give me Mimzy.
No! No! - Give her to me, Emma!
Emma, just give her to me now.
Jo, Jo, stop... Stop... - Ok, David, please.
no, mommy, no! - No. No, mom...
Noah, I...
it's those things that they found on the beach...
and I want them out of here now.
now, Noah, where are they?
Noah, where are they? - But mom...
where are they?! I want them out of here now!
Jo!
mom! - What? Stop it! Where are they?
they're in my backpack, ok?!
No! Mom!
OK, everything's gonna be fine.
bring her back! - Mom!
Jo, what are you doing? - No!
mom! Please, please... - Daddy, I want her!
no, mom! They're nothing!
they're just rocks! - Jo!
I'm sorry.
mom, we didn't do anything!
I want Mimzy! - Mom!
Noah!
don't say I never do anything for you.
Mimzy!
how did you find her?
she was in the garbage.
don't let mom see.
the spinners too?
they're in bad shape.
they're crumbling.
we have to hurry, Noah. - To what?
I've gotta show you something.
why are you showing me that?
it's about Alice...
...Going through the looking glass.
I think it explains what the machine is.
wait a minute.
that looks like Mimzy.
how could she have Mimzy?
that was 100 years ago.
maybe she has spinners too, Noah.
maybe she didn't get what she was supposed to do.
maybe she needed a brother like you.
like me, what for?
because you're my engineer. - What do you mean, your engineer?
I mean I can't do it all alone, Noah.
Noah, I have to look.
Emma?
Emma?
Emma, what's happening?
Emma!
Emma!
em!
Oh, my god.
Emma?
Emma!
mom! Dad!
Emma. - What is it?
I think Emma's hurt!
hold on, hold on, Noah! - I'm all right.
Jo!
Oh, my gosh!
Emma, it's gonna be all right! Hold on!
what is it? What happened?
what's going on? - Noah?
what's going on, huh? - I'm ok, mommy. I'm ok.
I think she was dreaming. She must've fallen out of bed.
it wasn't dreaming and I didn't fall out of bed.
I looked through a looking glass, mommy.
I looked through it, just like Alice.
what did you see? - A strange scientist.
it was scary.
know what? I'm gonna put you back into bed.
good night, Noah.
Oh, David!
Mr. and Mrs. Wilder, let me explain this to you.
we are born with over 100 billion brain cells.
the connectors are called synapses...
and by the time a child reaches the age of 3...
its brain has formed about 1, 000 trillion of them.
but then, as we become adults...
...we lose over half of them.
and the brain becomes rigid or hard-wired.
all their potential brain power gets reduced...
...Narrows down...
...and specializes.
but your children are different.
this is an image of a child's brain, age 2.
this is an adult's brain.
and, in particular, this is Emma's.
now, not only is her development completely off the charts...
but this section is all new growth.
now the red and orange areas indicate significant brain activity.
what's so amazing is that we were able to see changes...
...in the time in between the different images.
now, there's nothing...
...in the literature that addresses this.
so, I've spoken to my colleagues...
...and we would like to schedule some more tests...
...as quickly as possible.
if that's... all right with you.
Oh, I... I don't know.
I...
I just can't believe this.
Oh, what are you doing home? It's not even 4 o'clock.
I've, uh taken a leave of absence from the firm, Jo.
indefinite.
two weeks, maybe more, as long as it takes.
I talked to the guys, told them we have some family problems...
...and they seemed ok with it.
so... here I am.
Oh, here you are.
thank you.
are you sure? - I am absolutely sure.
daddy, daddy! - Hey.
Hey, dad, you're home early.
daddy! - C'mere. C'mere.
how you doing?
that's my package pickup. - Thanks!
what's going on? What's going on here?
terrorism task force, stand back.
take everybody into the living room.
get away from her! Who's in charge?!
I wanna speak to who's in charge!
you'll have plenty of time to talk, trust me.
who are you? Why are you doing this?
his name is Broadman, mommy.
who told you that?
we have a right to know what we're being accused of.
what's this about?
you're being held for reasons of national security...
...under the patriot act. - But we haven't done anything!
we know about the power outage, where it originated.
I need to get something.
OK, you go with her. - Yes, sir.
and I'd like to know if you have a search warrant.
I got probable cause, I don't need a search warrant, sir.
mom, I'm sorry. - Look.
I want everybody outta here right now...
...and into the vans. Let's get this shut down. Let's go.
all right, you heard him, let's go.
daddy... - Now, go!
get your jackets, it's pretty chilly outside.
where they taking us, daddy? - What's going on?
where we going? - Mrs. Wilder!
is everything all right?
who are these people?
where we taking them? - Not to jail, that's for sure.
look, seal this place off, go through everything.
bring me anything that looks suspicious.
Yes, sir.
go.
I want them inside.
let's go. Four of you follow me.
are we good?
this way.
let's go.
Mr. Broadman'll be in a moment to talk to you.
what's going on here, Noah?
what did you do?
sweetheart, what aren't you telling us?
I didn't know...
I didn't know what it could do.
I... didn't mean...
you didn't know what what could do?
th... The machine, the generator.
the generator?
you guys, be quiet, they're probably listening...
...to everything we're saying. Just...
what generator?
I made it with the toys.
whoa, whoa, whoa, play that last part back.
the machine, the generator.
the generator?
you guys, please, be quiet, they're probably listening...
...to everything we're saying, just...
what generator?
I made it with the toys.
what generator? What toys?
Yeah, we got that from the break room feed.
now, the next one is a selection from the teacher.
Dave, can you give me the teacher?
I... I don't know anything about any continuation...
...or terrorist cells or anything.
I'm just a science teacher.
I promise you, that's all I do.
I just... I teach science, I went to Nepal once...
but... that was just for a vacation.
this next one is the babysitter. Dave.
she... She made her hand dissolve...
...into a billion pieces...
just... Just...
like that, I mean...
it wasn't natural, that's...
that's not natural, right? I mean...
she's an alien.
I think they all are.
am I the only one here...
...who doesn't have a clue to what's going on?
thank you. We just have a few questions.
um, could you tell us what these are?
those are nothing. They're just... toys.
what about this?
that's... just a toy too.
what are these? - Those are spinners.
would you ask her to keep back? - I'm not dangerous.
I can show you.
uh, it's just a magic trick.
Mimzy showed me how to do this.
Mimzy. Is that Mimzy?
can we see your bunny? - No!
we won't hurt it. - No!
I want her! - It's ok.
give Mimzy back! - Broadman!
that's a child's toy. What are you doing?
it's not like anything I've ever seen.
let's do a slice and scan right away.
sweetheart. Oh, boy.
Broadman, explain what's going on.
I don't know what's going on, you said it was magic.
what kind of magic is that?
what's... Why... Where are they taking it?
how long is it gonna take? What are they doing?
it's not gonna take that long. Just be patient.
bring her back now! - What's going on in there?
OK, here's the slice.
are you getting this? It's extraordinary.
it's almost as if this thing could alive...
...like it's mimicking the nervous system.
I'm gonna take it down another level. I wanna go deeper.
you're pushing the limits here Steve.
it will start breaking up. Just a bit more.
Whoa! Whoa! Stop!
look at that.
what is it? You guys see what I see?
look, I've been at Intel for more than two decades.
I know every nanotechnology project ever initiated.
all of them. And we've dreamed about this.
we've dreamed about creating artificial life.
it would be amazing, we'd change the world.
but we are eons away...
...from achieving anything like this. Eons.
all right, let's recap what happened...
...At least the best we can.
we know these things, these... objects...
...are made from technology that no one here's ever seen before.
and somehow they have a Intel logo...
...Etched in their molecules.
we know that there was a major power outage in half the state.
we know... or at least we think we saw...
a little girl atomize her arm.
does anybody have any thoughts on this?
can I talk?
Mimzy'd like to speak to you. - She wants to speak? Where?
she's in the other room. She's telling me what to say.
the people in the future can't travel through time.
they need our help.
something in them is broken.
and we can fix it.
we have what they need.
she says it's in our genes.
our genes?
they've been sending other Mimzys into the past...
to look for it.
but none of them have come back. She says she is the last one.
I'm sorry, this... This is crazy.
hold it, please let her finish.
she says people can't travel through time.
cause they'll die.
so they built dolls to do it...
...like Mimzy.
but she won't be here much longer.
she's disintegrating.
mommy, we have to send her back right away.
she says everybody is dying.
OK, that's it. - Please, just let her finish.
she's done. I want more expert brought in on this thing.
on this, there are no experts.
Noah, can you hear me?
I need you.
I need you to help me.
em, where are you?
Noah, don't talk. I don't wanna wake anyone.
do you hear me? - See, you can do it too!
it's like walkie-talkies. - Better.
we need to get the spinners and the generator.
there's a camera.
what do we do?
use your spider speak, Noah.
right.
got it.
em...
took care of the cameras.
I can unlock the door, Noah.
it's locked.
the spinners are breaking. We need more.
we don't have more. - Yes, we do.
on Whidbey. Under the bed. I can see them.
well, what good is that gonna do us?
come on, we have to hurry.
there it is. Come on, Noah. Let's go.
you have to drive us to Whidbey.
I can't drive.
Yes, you can. Just like phantom racer.
you can do it. Come on, let's go.
Whoa!
what's that?
this is a lot easier than phantom racer.
please drive carefully.
what's wrong?
I think we're out of gas.
now what?
what? - I was dreaming.
Oh, man, it was so vivid.
you... You know that crab place on highway 20?
Yeah.
I was standing in the parking lot.
no, but it was... It's like I was really there.
parking lot at...?
well...
did you... Did you see any numbers?
sorry. - I was standing there...
...and I was waiting for something or someone...
...and I really wanted to run but I couldn't move.
honey. - Yeah.
and... I knew something really important was gonna happen.
but then I got scared and I woke up.
OK.
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to sleep.
no, no, you're not gonna go back to sleep.
and you know why?
because you have to go there.
what are you talking about? This was a dream.
how many of these dreams do you have to have, Larry?
honey, the universe is speaking to you.
it is?
Larry!
what is it saying?
well, right now it's saying,...
..."Get out of bed and put on some clothes.
check it out.
do you see that? Do you see that?
you keep doubting yourself...
...and you keep doubting me but do you see that, Larry?
Mr. White, what are you doing here?
what am I doing here?
you're asking me what I'm doing here?
I don't know what I'm doing here. What am I doing here?
he listened to his dream. That's what he's doing here.
look... Who drove you here?
we drove ourselves.
in that? In the truck?
Wh... What were you doing driving a truck? You're a little boy!
we escaped. We need you.
we need you to help us get to Whidbey.
Whidbey? What is on Whidbey?
our house. Where we found Mimzy.
well, we're not gonna be able to help you with that.
I'm so sorry. Because your parents have probably...
...Contacted the authorities...
...and we could be arrested for kidnapping.
Larry, could i talk to you? Just give us a second, kids.
I'm so sorry. It's true what I'm say...
what are you doing? We are talking miracles here!
the whole universe is trying to communicate with you...
...and you're worried about...
...Something as earthbound as kidnapping?
God, I love you but you drive me crazy.
come on, it's a long drive.
I don't even know how to get to Whidbey island.
I do. Come on, kids, get in the car.
can I drive? - No!
Yeah, let the kid drive.
why not? - Larry! Get in the car.
do you guys know how to use seatbelts? Put them on.
here you go. Here you go.
you got your doll?
OK, everybody, fingers and toes in. Good.
seatbelts, please! Ok, Whidbey island.
Hi, this is Jo... - Oh, hi, Jo.
I'm not here right now to take your call...
so please... - Damn it!
are you ok?
does anyone know any games?
uh, I spy... - This really is not the time.
Larry!
I don't want Mimzy to die.
Mimzy's not gonna die.
look, trust me. We have all the roads covered.
we're gonna get them back. They're just two kids.
the state police got an ID On the laundry truck.
it was abandoned on highway 20.
Highway 20? They're headed to our beach house on Whidbey.
this is it, kids? - What's the rush?
hurry up, Noah! - Where are they?
I'm coming! - Oh, man.
OK. Just let us know if you need anything.
they got lost.
we gotta go in. We gotta go in. - Larry, just give them a second.
don't hover. Larry!
Larry!
I'm just checking. - It's fine.
Hey, Noah. Hey, Emma.
Hey, what's going on, guys?
give them some space. - Can you give me a break?
I'm trying to find out what these kids are up to.
here's a perfect spot. - Good.
help me, Noah. Help me clear it out.
for what?
what, are you having a picnic here?
what are gonna do, Em?
get the rest.
Oh, yeah!
is the generator ready, Noah?
generator? Oh, sure!
it is!
what is it?
Larry, what is that?
I don't know.
you're gonna have to turn it on and aim it right there.
I'm scared, Noah. - Me too, em.
I love you, Mimzy.
that... is...
...Weird.
now, Noah. Make it go.
Noah, it's us, we're building the bridge.
it's for Mimzy to go back.
this is... This is my dream!
it's like... I'm in my dream.
this is our destiny, Larry.
goodbye, Mimzy. Be a good rabbit.
Noah!
help!
Noah, what are you doing? - Put me down! Help!
I can't! - Noah, turn it off!
Noah!
Emma!
Noah, put her down! Ah!
are you ok? - Don't touch it.
Noah! - Honey, let go!
Emma, we're here now!
Oh, no, don't! - Emma!
Emma!
Emma!
daddy, help!
get back, stay back.
help! I'm stuck!
Emma! - Noah, help!
why is it doing this? You gotta let her down.
let me down! - Dad, take the generator!
put it down! Make it stop!
dad, you have to! - Let me down!
please, trust me!
I know how to get her down!
Jo, help!
take it! Take your hand off.
you gotta hold it! I can get to her! I'm coming u p!
come on, Noah! - Emma! Help her, please!
let go! Let go, Emma!
I can't hold on.
Oh, my gosh.
we did it, Em.
Yeah. - It worked.
are you all right?
Oh, Noah.
sweetie. - Fantastic.
did you see the bridge? - That was incredible.
Oh, my... - I don't understand this...
but I know I'm sorry.
is there anything I can do for you guys?
anything at all?
no.
all right.
dad, can you believe all this?
Noah, you were absolutely amazing.
honey, I don't know if this means anything...
yeah?
but when it disappeared... - Mm-Hm?
...I did see numbers. - Numbers?
Larry! Oh, my god!
come on in. - Get a lotto ticket!
any idea what just happened? Where did Em go?
Emma?
I'll miss you, Mimzy.
no, don't stop. What happened to Mimzy?
Mimzy returned to her own time...
...as if time had stopped.
it was what the scientist had hoped for.
to find a soul in the past...
...not contaminated...
...By the pollutants that filled our bodies...
...and minds.
our precious quality of humanity had been turned off...
but in Emma's tears was the instruction for an awakening.
and it spread like wild flowers.
people shed their protective suits.
and over time, humanity blossomed again.
our world was saved by a child...
...very much like you.
Emma was our mother.
the mother of us all.
all right, children, it's getting late now.
time to go home.
don't forget your homework.
see you tomorrow.
goodbye.
goodbye, Lena!
goodbye!
goodbye!
Bye, Lena!
now, children.
who wants to tell us how they spent their weekend?
did you go to the playground?
did you spend time with your friends?
anyone?
well, then. I'll just pick someone.
Emma, why don't you start?
OK, go finish breakfast, sweetie.
I... guess. Sure. Whatever.
is everything ok? - Yeah.
something is going on with your son...
...and I'd like to talk to you about it.
ever since the science fair... But really even before that.
Yes, I know, I... I've been feeling the same thing.
there's something I'd like to show you.
uh, what is this?
uh, this is a Tibetan painting. It's called up mandala.
it's a symbolic representation of the universe.
this one's actually almost 1, 000 years old.
well, it's... beautiful...
but why are you showing it to me?
these were drawn by your son.
Noah drew these?
amazing.
when I saw Noah's drawings...
...they really struck a chord.
now especially this one...
...which is particularly rare.
Yeah, this is actually an astrological configuration.
the books says it's a map to the past and future.
um, in Tibet, uh...
they believe that there are extraordinary children...
...with this very special knowledge...
and... And abilities.
uh, they are considered actually very rare souls.
very gifted, like Noah. They're called tolkus.
and then they even have a particularly...
uh, specific means of identifying these children...
markings, on their hands.
palm readers can look at their lines...
and tell if they're one of these special beings.
we met some of these kids and I actually had the honor...
...of being able to look at their palms, which was...
Naomi studied with a palm reader for several years.
she's really... She's quite good.
Larry... Thank you. - No, I mean you are.
well... You're very gifted. So...
can she look at mine?
honey, what are you doing here?
I couldn't help it, I... I wanted to look.
will you?
uh, well I'm... I'm not actually an expert...
mom, please.
uh... I'm sorry...
I just don't believe in all of this stuff.
I know it sounds really weird...
but there are many cultures that take this very seriously.
OK.
let's see.
do you see anything?
this is a very good hand.
really.
this is what lamas would call auspicious.
meaning that you will have a very good life.
but is it special?
it's very special in its own way.
it's just not what I was, uh, talking about before.
what about mine?
um... Would...
OK.
what is it? What's wrong?
huh, this is a... A very special hand.
do you see how simple the lines are?
I've never seen anything so pure.
what does it mean?
it means you have a remarkable child.
do you have a copy machine?
we need to find some way to document this.
maybe we could show it to some people?
uh, no, sorry, I don't.
mom, sure, you do.
no, I'm sorry. Look, uh...
I, just... This is all starting to feel...
...too strange for me.
it's been so strange for both of us as well.
I'd just like you to stop.
thank you for your time. We should go, I think.
Thanks.
that's a very cute bunny.
she's Mimzy, she's my teacher.
she teaches me everything.
she taught me about the painting and the book.
she told me it was called the 7 mountains.
my daughter has a very active imagination.
Oh, come on.
that's not what it's called, is it?
...the recent mysterious blackout...
...are now zeroing in on Seattle...
...as the likely source.
and in other news, 40 are dead...
Hey, why don't you, uh, come to bed?
no, I... I'm not tired.
you gotta... You gotta stop thinking about this stuff...
you really do. - No, I can't!
David, the lines on their hands...
I've never noticed them before.
all right, look, we... We...
I mean, what do you know about palmistry?
this woman, she could've told you anything.
how would you know? - Emma knew the painting!
she knew what it was called. It's just not possible.
I mean, I think you're just making way too much out of it.
Oh, David, you said that we'd get help now.
all right, what are we gonna tell a doctor?
our kids have funny lines in their hands...
...and they make weird drawings?
I just don't... I don't buy any of this stuff, you know.
I don't understand.
what do you mean?
but I don't want the world to end...
ever.
I love the world.
I don't want it to die.
I know. I know.
with all my heart.
I love you so much.
good morning, everybody. - Hey.
morning - Hi.
can i get you something? - No, no. No. No.
I got it. I got it.
it's fine.
dad, you're eating breakfast at home.
Yes, I thought it would be nice to join you. Why not?
whoa, take it easy there on the sugar.
but dad, I always have this much.
Hey, Noah, stop.
Hey, Noah...
where are your glasses? How come you're not wearing them?
don't worry about it, it's ok.
Noah, go and get your glasses.
I don't need them.
of course you do, now go and get your glasses.
mom, lighten up.
Noah, come on, now, don't talk to your mother that way.
do what she said. - Oh, but dad, I-I'm...
no, do what she said, go get your glasses, ok?
I think Mimzy's sick. - What's that?
I think Mimzy's sick.
can you tell? Something's wrong.
she's getting weaker.
I'm afraid she's going to die.
she's a stuffed animal, Emma.
now, you gotta...
you know, stop it with this Mimzy stuff.
OK, here's what I'd like you to do.
I'd like you to just...
put Mimzy away, put the rabbit away, all right?
so that we can have a really great breakfast together.
Emma, put the rabbit away.
what is wrong with this family? I mean it's not...
look, I want you to put the rabbit away, ok?
all right? Just...
could you pass the sugar?
dad, you don't need that much sugar!
and all of a sudden, I kind you not...
...the sugar starts to rise by itself up...
...it forms this pattern, and it comes over...
...and all of it lands in my bowl.
now, I looked at her and she's just smiling.
very, very peacefully, just looking at it.
and, I mean, wh-what is this?
this is so far out of my league.
I...
I've heard of...
psychokinesis being practiced by advanced meditators before...
...but I always thought it was just a metaphor.
no, come on, this is not a metaphor...
...we're dealing with, it's way beyond metaphor at this point.
it's not... - And I'm sorry that I was...
...just so dismissive the other day.
it was just that all of this is so beyond...
...and we...
we just don't know where to turn.
so we called you because we thought that...
...maybe it could be related to Noah's drawings...
...and the paintings in the book.
uh, we... We just don't know what to do.
I have a friend, Arnie Rose.
he's a neurologist at northwest hospital.
um...
maybe there's some kind of connection...
scientific, medical or otherwise.
we could have him... see your kids.
Yes, that's a very good idea.
Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely.
all right, we should get the...
we... We should get the kids, where are the kids?
they're upstairs. - Right, so what we should do...
help! - What is it?!
mom, dad, it's Emma!
we need you!
Mr. Wilder, should we come?
what is it, Noah?! - Emma?
Hi, mommy.
I learned this from Mimzy too.
Emma! - Mommy, please, it's all right.
OK.
now I... I need you to give me Mimzy.
No! No! - Give her to me, Emma!
Emma, just give her to me now.
Jo, Jo, stop... Stop... - Ok, David, please.
no, mommy, no! - No. No, mom...
Noah, I...
it's those things that they found on the beach...
and I want them out of here now.
now, Noah, where are they?
Noah, where are they? - But mom...
where are they?! I want them out of here now!
Jo!
mom! - What? Stop it! Where are they?
they're in my backpack, ok?!
No! Mom!
OK, everything's gonna be fine.
bring her back! - Mom!
Jo, what are you doing? - No!
mom! Please, please... - Daddy, I want her!
no, mom! They're nothing!
they're just rocks! - Jo!
I'm sorry.
mom, we didn't do anything!
I want Mimzy! - Mom!
Noah!
don't say I never do anything for you.
Mimzy!
how did you find her?
she was in the garbage.
don't let mom see.
the spinners too?
they're in bad shape.
they're crumbling.
we have to hurry, Noah. - To what?
I've gotta show you something.
why are you showing me that?
it's about Alice...
...going through the looking glass.
I think it explains what the machine is.
wait a minute.
that looks like Mimzy.
how could she have Mimzy?
that was 100 years ago.
maybe she has spinners too, Noah.
maybe she didn't get what she was supposed to do.
maybe she needed a brother like you.
like me, what for?
because you're my engineer. - What do you mean, your engineer?
I mean I can't do it all alone, Noah.
Noah, I have to look.
Emma?
Emma?
Emma, what's happening?
Emma!
Emma!
em!
Oh, my god.
Emma?
Emma!
mom! Dad!
Emma. - What is it?
I think Emma's hurt!
hold on, hold on, Noah! - I'm all right.
Jo!
Oh, my gosh!
Emma, it's gonna be all right! Hold on!
what is it? What happened?
what's going on? - Noah?
what's going on, huh? - I'm ok, mommy. I'm ok.
I think she was dreaming. She must've fallen out of bed.
it wasn't dreaming and I didn't fall out of bed.
I looked through a looking glass, mommy.
I looked through it, just like Alice.
what did you see? - A strange scientist.
it was scary.
know what? I'm gonna put you back into bed.
good night, Noah.
Oh, David!
Mr. and Mrs. Wilder, let me explain this to you.
we are born with over 100 billion brain cells.
the connectors are called synapses...
and by the time a child reaches the age of 3...
its brain has formed about 1, 000 trillion of them.
but then, as we become adults...
...we lose over half of them.
and the brain becomes rigid or hard-wired.
all their potential brain power gets reduced...
...narrows down...
...and specializes.
but your children are different.
this is an image of a child's brain, age 2.
this is an adult's brain.
and, in particular, this is Emma's.
now, not only is her development completely off the charts...
but this section is all new growth.
now the red and orange areas indicate significant brain activity.
what's so amazing is that we were able to see changes...
...in the time in between the different images.
now, there's nothing...
...in the literature that addresses this.
so, I've spoken to my colleagues...
...and we would like to schedule some more tests...
...as quickly as possible.
if that's... all right with you.
Oh, I... I don't know.
I...
I just can't believe this.
Oh, what are you doing home? It's not even 4 o'clock.
I've, uh taken a leave of absence from the firm, Jo.
indefinite.
two weeks, maybe more, as long as it takes.
I talked to the guys, told them we have some family problems...
...and they seemed ok with it.
so... here I am.
Oh, here you are.
thank you.
are you sure? - I am absolutely sure.
daddy, daddy! - Hey.
Hey, dad, you're home early.
daddy! - C'mere. C'mere.
how you doing?
that's my package pickup. - Thanks!
what's going on? What's going on here?
terrorism task force, stand back.
take everybody into the living room.
get away from her! Who's in charge?!
I wanna speak to who's in charge!
you'll have plenty of time to talk, trust me.
who are you? Why are you doing this?
his name is Broadman, mommy.
who told you that?
we have a right to know what we're being accused of.
what's this about?
you're being held for reasons of national security...
...under the patriot act. - But we haven't done anything!
we know about the power outage, where it originated.
I need to get something.
OK, you go with her. - Yes, sir.
and I'd like to know if you have a search warrant.
I got probable cause, I don't need a search warrant, sir.
mom, I'm sorry. - Look.
I want everybody outta here right now...
...and into the vans. Let's get this shut down. Let's go.
all right, you heard him, let's go.
daddy... - Now, go!
get your jackets, it's pretty chilly outside.
where they taking us, daddy? - What's going on?
where we going? - Mrs. Wilder!
is everything all right?
who are these people?
where we taking them? - Not to jail, that's for sure.
look, seal this place off, go through everything.
bring me anything that looks suspicious.
Yes, sir.
go.
I want them inside.
let's go. Four of you follow me.
are we good?
this way.
let's go.
Mr. Broadman'll be in a moment to talk to you.
what's going on here, Noah?
what did you do?
sweetheart, what aren't you telling us?
I didn't know...
I didn't know what it could do.
I... didn't mean...
you didn't know what what could do?
th... The machine, the generator.
the generator?
you guys, be quiet, they're probably listening...
...to everything we're saying. Just...
what generator?
I made it with the toys.
whoa, whoa, whoa, play that last part back.
the machine, the generator.
the generator?
you guys, please, be quiet, they're probably listening...
...to everything we're saying, just...
what generator?
I made it with the toys.
what generator? What toys?
Yeah, we got that from the break room feed.
now, the next one is a selection from the teacher.
Dave, can you give me the teacher?
I... I don't know anything about any continuation...
...or terrorist cells or anything.
I'm just a science teacher.
I promise you, that's all I do.
I just... I teach science, I went to Nepal once...
but... that was just for a vacation.
this next one is the babysitter. Dave.
she... She made her hand dissolve...
...into a billion pieces...
just... Just...
like that, I mean...
it wasn't natural, that's...
that's not natural, right? I mean...
she's an alien.
I think they all are.
am I the only one here...
...who doesn't have a clue to what's going on?
thank you. We just have a few questions.
um, could you tell us what these are?
those are nothing. They're just... toys.
what about this?
that's... just a toy too.
what are these? - Those are spinners.
would you ask her to keep back? - I'm not dangerous.
I can show you.
uh, it's just a magic trick.
Mimzy showed me how to do this.
Mimzy. Is that Mimzy?
can we see your bunny? - No!
we won't hurt it. - No!
I want her! - It's ok.
give Mimzy back! - Broadman!
that's a child's toy. What are you doing?
it's not like anything I've ever seen.
let's do a slice and scan right away.
sweetheart. Oh, boy.
Broadman, explain what's going on.
I don't know what's going on, you said it was magic.
what kind of magic is that?
what's... Why... Where are they taking it?
how long is it gonna take? What are they doing?
it's not gonna take that long. Just be patient.
bring her back now! - What's going on in there?
OK, here's the slice.
are you getting this? It's extraordinary.
it's almost as if this thing could alive...
...like it's mimicking the nervous system.
I'm gonna take it down another level. I wanna go deeper.
you're pushing the limits here Steve.
it will start breaking up. Just a bit more.
Whoa! Whoa! Stop!
look at that.
what is it? You guys see what I see?
look, I've been at Intel for more than two decades.
I know every nanotechnology project ever initiated.
all of them. And we've dreamed about this.
we've dreamed about creating artificial life.
it would be amazing, we'd change the world.
but we are eons away...
...from achieving anything like this. Eons.
all right, let's recap what happened...
...at least the best we can.
we know these things, these... objects...
...are made from technology that no one here's ever seen before.
and somehow they have a Intel logo...
...etched in their molecules.
we know that there was a major power outage in half the state.
we know... or at least we think we saw...
a little girl atomize her arm.
does anybody have any thoughts on this?
can I talk?
Mimzy'd like to speak to you. - She wants to speak? Where?
she's in the other room. She's telling me what to say.
the people in the future can't travel through time.
they need our help.
something in them is broken.
and we can fix it.
we have what they need.
she says it's in our genes.
our genes?
they've been sending other Mimzys into the past...
to look for it.
but none of them have come back. She says she is the last one.
I'm sorry, this... This is crazy.
hold it, please let her finish.
she says people can't travel through time.
cause they'll die.
so they built dolls to do it...
...like Mimzy.
but she won't be here much longer.
she's disintegrating.
mommy, we have to send her back right away.
she says everybody is dying.
OK, that's it. - Please, just let her finish.
she's done. I want more expert brought in on this thing.
on this, there are no experts.
Noah, can you hear me?
I need you.
I need you to help me.
em, where are you?
Noah, don't talk. I don't wanna wake anyone.
do you hear me? - See, you can do it too!
it's like walkie-talkies. - Better.
we need to get the spinners and the generator.
there's a camera.
what do we do?
use your spider speak, Noah.
right.
got it.
em...
took care of the cameras.
I can unlock the door, Noah.
it's locked.
the spinners are breaking. We need more.
we don't have more. - Yes, we do.
on Whidbey. Under the bed. I can see them.
well, what good is that gonna do us?
come on, we have to hurry.
there it is. Come on, Noah. Let's go.
you have to drive us to Whidbey.
I can't drive.
Yes, you can. Just like phantom racer.
you can do it. Come on, let's go.
Whoa!
what's that?
this is a lot easier than phantom racer.
please drive carefully.
what's wrong?
I think we're out of gas.
now what?
what? - I was dreaming.
Oh, man, it was so vivid.
you... You know that crab place on highway 20?
Yeah.
I was standing in the parking lot.
no, but it was... It's like I was really there.
parking lot at...?
well...
did you... Did you see any numbers?
sorry. - I was standing there...
...and I was waiting for something or someone...
...and I really wanted to run but I couldn't move.
honey. - Yeah.
and... I knew something really important was gonna happen.
but then I got scared and I woke up.
OK.
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to sleep.
no, no, you're not gonna go back to sleep.
and you know why?
because you have to go there.
what are you talking about? This was a dream.
how many of these dreams do you have to have, Larry?
honey, the universe is speaking to you.
it is?
Larry!
what is it saying?
well, right now it's saying,...
..."Get out of bed and put on some clothes.
check it out.
do you see that? Do you see that?
you keep doubting yourself...
...and you keep doubting me but do you see that, Larry?
Mr. White, what are you doing here?
what am I doing here?
you're asking me what I'm doing here?
I don't know what I'm doing here. What am I doing here?
he listened to his dream. That's what he's doing here.
look... Who drove you here?
we drove ourselves.
in that? In the truck?
Wh... What were you doing driving a truck? You're a little boy!
we escaped. We need you.
we need you to help us get to Whidbey.
Whidbey? What is on Whidbey?
our house. Where we found Mimzy.
well, we're not gonna be able to help you with that.
I'm so sorry. Because your parents have probably...
...contacted the authorities...
...and we could be arrested for kidnapping.
Larry, could i talk to you? Just give us a second, kids.
I'm so sorry. It's true what I'm say...
what are you doing? We are talking miracles here!
the whole universe is trying to communicate with you...
...and you're worried about...
...something as earthbound as kidnapping?
God, I love you but you drive me crazy.
come on, it's a long drive.
I don't even know how to get to Whidbey island.
I do. Come on, kids, get in the car.
can I drive? - No!
Yeah, let the kid drive.
why not? - Larry! Get in the car.
do you guys know how to use seatbelts? Put them on.
here you go. Here you go.
you got your doll?
OK, everybody, fingers and toes in. Good.
seatbelts, please! Ok, Whidbey island.
Hi, this is Jo... - Oh, hi, Jo.
I'm not here right now to take your call...
so please... - Damn it!
are you ok?
does anyone know any games?
uh, I spy... - This really is not the time.
Larry!
I don't want Mimzy to die.
Mimzy's not gonna die.
look, trust me. We have all the roads covered.
we're gonna get them back. They're just two kids.
the state police got an ID On the laundry truck.
it was abandoned on highway 20.
Highway 20? They're headed to our beach house on Whidbey.
this is it, kids? - What's the rush?
hurry up, Noah! - Where are they?
I'm coming! - Oh, man.
OK. Just let us know if you need anything.
they got lost.
we gotta go in. We gotta go in. - Larry, just give them a second.
don't hover. Larry!
Larry!
I'm just checking. - It's fine.
Hey, Noah. Hey, Emma.
Hey, what's going on, guys?
give them some space. - Can you give me a break?
I'm trying to find out what these kids are up to.
here's a perfect spot. - Good.
help me, Noah. Help me clear it out.
for what?
what, are you having a picnic here?
what are gonna do, Em?
get the rest.
Oh, yeah!
is the generator ready, Noah?
generator? Oh, sure!
it is!
what is it?
Larry, what is that?
I don't know.
you're gonna have to turn it on and aim it right there.
I'm scared, Noah. - Me too, em.
I love you, Mimzy.
that... is...
...weird.
now, Noah. Make it go.
Noah, it's us, we're building the bridge.
it's for Mimzy to go back.
this is... This is my dream!
it's like... I'm in my dream.
this is our destiny, Larry.
goodbye, Mimzy. Be a good rabbit.
Noah!
help!
Noah, what are you doing? - Put me down! Help!
I can't! - Noah, turn it off!
Noah!
Emma!
Noah, put her down! Ah!
are you ok? - Don't touch it.
Noah! - Honey, let go!
Emma, we're here now!
Oh, no, don't! - Emma!
Emma!
Emma!
daddy, help!
get back, stay back.
help! I'm stuck!
Emma! - Noah, help!
why is it doing this? You gotta let her down.
let me down! - Dad, take the generator!
put it down! Make it stop!
dad, you have to! - Let me down!
please, trust me!
I know how to get her down!
Jo, help!
take it! Take your hand off.
you gotta hold it! I can get to her! I'm coming u p!
come on, Noah! - Emma! Help her, please!
let go! Let go, Emma!
I can't hold on.
Oh, my gosh.
we did it, Em.
Yeah. - It worked.
are you all right?
Oh, Noah.
sweetie. - Fantastic.
did you see the bridge? - That was incredible.
Oh, my... - I don't understand this...
but I know I'm sorry.
is there anything I can do for you guys?
anything at all?
no.
all right.
dad, can you believe all this?
Noah, you were absolutely amazing.
honey, I don't know if this means anything...
yeah?
but when it disappeared... - Mm-Hm?
...I did see numbers. - Numbers?
Larry! Oh, my god!
come on in. - Get a lotto ticket!
any idea what just happened? Where did Em go?
Emma?
I'll miss you, Mimzy.
no, don't stop. What happened to Mimzy?
Mimzy returned to her own time...
...as if time had stopped.
it was what the scientist had hoped for.
to find a soul in the past...
...not contaminated...
...By the pollutants that filled our bodies...
...and minds.
our precious quality of humanity had been turned off...
but in Emma's tears was the instruction for an awakening.
and it spread like wild flowers.
people shed their protective suits.
and over time, humanity blossomed again.
our world was saved by a child...
...very much like you.
Emma was our mother.
the mother of us all.
all right, children, it's getting late now.
time to go home.
don't forget your homework.
see you tomorrow.
goodbye.
goodbye, Lena!
goodbye!
goodbye!
Bye, Lena!
now, children.
who wants to tell us how they spent their weekend?
did you go to the playground?
did you spend time with your friends?
anyone?
well, then. I'll just pick someone.
Emma, why don't you start?
everybody in? Atkins, Atkins?
Oh, come on, man, let's go.
no, man, your sister didn't send me that check yet.
no, this is how you play the-- This is how you play Texas Hold'em.
you just told us how to play it!
this is how you play Texas Hold'em.
will you flip another card. This is the fourth fucking...
four of a kind. - What do you got, Melvin?
yo, Melvin, man, what you gonna do, you gonna play the cards or you gonna hatch them?
I ain't gonna hatch them. I need to run out to the ATM real quick.
there's gotta be a...
gotta be a 7-Eleven out there somewhere.
let me get two.
so why don't we just go directly in.
right up this route, straight in.
Yes, well, I see the captain enjoys the road less traveled.
no, the captain enjoys not going down the highway, dragging his ass so every Tom, Dick and Qaddafi can take a whack at it.
it's very bad here.
it's bad here, it's still bad here.
and I've heard it's bad right down here.
bad everywhere, huh? - Yeah.
mines?
tricky. Swedish-made.
the man didn't say anything about mines to me.
sergeant Shaw.
sergeant. - Sir.
rolling in two minutes.
Yes, sir.
you okay?
Yes, sir.
two minutes.
yo, give me two cards, man.
captain says we're moving out.
so...
Hey, that cat needs a friend. And a hug.
it was just before Desert Storm.
we were on a routine recon inside Iraqi-controlled terrain, assessing enemy troop strength for what Saddam Hussein promised would be the mother of all wars.
I'm in the lead vehicle with Sergeant Shaw and our guide, a civilian contractor.
the night is clear. Stars, but no moon.
ambush!
hang on.
exit the vehicle. On me! On me!
get a flare up, sergeant.
enemy dismount! Go after, go after! Stay left!
covering, covering, covering!
bear right!
move it, move it, move it!
captain Marco!
sir?
was you scared?
scared? Well...
...there was really no time to be scared.
with complete disregard for his own life,
sergeant Raymond Shaw engaged single-handedly an entire company of the enemy.
sergeant Shaw was awarded the Medal of Honor.
I signed the recommendation myself.
Yes, sir.
were you wounded?
I was, I was injured.
concussion, lost focus. Sergeant Shaw, he took command.
major?
Yes. - Did your unit sustain any casualties?
Yes. PFC Edward lngram,
PFC Robert Baker lll were killed.
now, the Medal of Honor, Congressional Medal of Honor, is the highest award that any soldier could aspire to.
what these brave men that I've talked about today did should never be forgotten.
since 1 91 7, there have only been 970 Medals awarded, out of a total of 30 million Americans at arms.
who knows.
maybe one day, one of you fine young men will earn that medal in defense of this great nation.
Yes.
major Marco, on behalf of Troops 1 094 and 1 1 28, just wanna thank you for coming to speak to us about the Medal of Honor and about your interesting experiences in the armed forces.
thanks for listening.
thank you very much.
you ever wish it had been you?
I'm sorry, excuse me?
won the Medal.
been-- Been the hero.
well, sir, I'm just-- I'm just proud that I was there.
thank you.
thank you very much.
major Marco? - Yes.
al Melvin, sir.
corporal Melvin.
from your unit, Desert Storm.
corporal Melvin. How you doing?
I have these dreams, sir.
dreams? - Yes, sir.
Kuwait. It's you and me,
Ingram and Baker and...
...Raymond Shaw.
okay.
see, I remember it happened like you just said, and then...
...I don't.
well...
...we had it pretty rough over there, Melvin.
that was a long time ago. Memories shift.
do you have dreams, sir?
everybody has dreams, corporal.
no, not these.
no, I don't.
I write it all down. You know, like, every night, right when I wake up, I try to get it down.
it doesn't always come together, you know, not everything that I can remember.
maybe you should go to the V. A. hospital, talk to one of the doctors.
I've been to doctors, man. - Okay.
I'm just... I'm just...
I'm just a little stuck, sir.
because I remember, okay, Shaw...
Shaw, okay... Shaw saving us, right...
...but that doesn't make sense, because...
...that should've been you.
okay, if Shaw is in the Hummer...
...the Toyota is here...
all right. Just get up, get up.
listen, it's...
that's over with. That's done. Okay? You gotta move on.
what I was hoping is that, you know, maybe
you need some money or something?
no, no, sir. - Wait a minute.
I don't need your money, man.
all right. It was great to see you.
paper or plastic, sir?
with public anxiety being rekindled by the events of Bloody Friday, with the war on terror continuing into yet another year, no end in sight, the worries just continue to grow.
polls indicate that more and more voters are concerned with personal family safety, with economic security, fearing more and more jobs going overseas or being taken by illegal immigrants.
they're concerned with the quality of air and our water, the degradation caused by the rollback in environmental regulations, by religious and racial polarization, with the drumbeat of body bags coming from all over the globe.
the American people are ready for a new agenda.
but because this party is so divided on so many issues, the choice of a vice presidential nominee may very well be the unifying factor for delegates at this convention.
and if this respect propels me toward the nomination as your vice presidential candidate, I will be greatly honored.
we need to look inward, attend to our own house.
the danger to our country is not only from some terrorists at large, terrorists who, by the way, we've helped engender with 20 years of failed foreign policy.
no, the real danger is from suspending civil liberties, gutting the Bill of Rights, allowing our fear to destroy our democratic ideals, because once we start overturning our constitutional protections, our enemies have won.
Raymond?
there he is. - Darling.
what, were you gonna make me stand out there like room service?
I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman, your wrangler, helpful Miss Freeman, she said you were up here practicing your speech.
I don't honestly understand why you insist upon isolating yourself, Raymond.
people adore you, they crave your company, and yet here you are, holed up as if you were some sort of emotionally challenged individual like your father.
shut up, Tom. Instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw, handsome, intelligent, people-loving war hero with a great deal to offer his party.
no. - And his country.
no.
no, what? - No.
I haven't even asked you a question yet.
no to all of the questions you pretend to want to ask.
your hair is too flat.
and no, you may not engage in your usual backdoor
and that tie...
political thuggery to shovel me onto the presidential ticket.
tie's wrong. Something less busy.
Oh, you're not interested.
of course I'm interested. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
but not if it means attacking the reputation of a statesman like Tom Jordan, which I am sure was part of your plan.
excuse me, when have I ever attacked Senator Jordan, despite
despite the shameful way his daughter toyed with you that summer at the shore.
you chased her away, Mother, let's not have any illusions about
she wasn't in your league, but if that's the way you choose to remember it...
you destroyed any possibility of us ever
honey, you are oversimplifying things a little bit, but it's okay.
I'll stay out of it.
you have my word.
thank you. Thank you.
I think you all know my mother, Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw.
and some of you, no doubt, remember my father, the late Senator John Shaw.
I've been honored to serve my two terms in Congress.
but I also grew up on the Hill.
I've seen how the game is played by professionals, committees bullied, agendas bought and sold.
and with apologies to my mother, I wish to remain an amateur.
I believe democracy is not negotiable.
I believe that freedom from fear in the world at large and here at home is not negotiable.
I know how much Americans have to fear today.
but I can tell you that I've been there.
I know what it is to be afraid.
but I am living proof that we can win.
we can prevail.
we must secure tomorrow today. Thank you.
bluffing? - That was the inference.
they should be down on their fat, white knees, thanking me for saving this party from committing political seppuku.
you gave them every opportunity to do the right thing, senator.
no. I gave them one opportunity and that was unusually generous of me.
see if you can get ahold of Bob Arthur, because I'm gonna wanna meet with him.
thank you very much for arranging this.
I appreciate it. - Sure.
Mr. Secretary. - Senator.
thank you very much for taking this meeting.
good to see you again. - Leona. So nice to see you, Leona.
buddy. Gentlemen.
no, I thought we settled it this morning.
all right, I'll keep you posted.
the decision is final.
thank you very much.
how's Jeanine? - Senator.
Tom Jordan's on the ticket.
now, we don't need your blessing, but we'd like it.
okay, so before we get started, I'm just
I'm dying to know...
...which genius hatched the idea of pairing a sound bite from Nebraska with a relic who thinks that keeping suicide bombers off our buses is unconstitutional. Was it you, Gordy?
all the research indicates that an Arthur-Jordan ticket sits quite well with the American people.
"Sits quite well" translates into how many votes?
your son is largely unknown outside of New York.
I mean, his public service, his congressional record, while commendable, is not the kind of thing
my son is a war hero.
governor Arthur has agreed to consider Raymond for a cabinet-level post.
we didn't come here to have a discussion.
did we come here to have a discussion?
Ellie, you don't have the votes to block this.
not even to push the nomination to a second ballot.
Oh, Jim, even running against this cut-and-fold vice president, with his party's record of abysmal failure at home and abroad,
governor Arthur is still unelectable to the presidency...
...without help.
consider, that our intrepid Arthur can hold on to his own home ground, and the Northeast, and even California, we are still dead across the South.
he's not dead completely in the South, senator...
and the Southwest, where they win by landslides.
your focus groups, your polls all tell you this.
they back me up, right?
now, you're counting on Tom Jordan to help you get the black vote, women and college kids.
my gut instinct says he won't, and on Arthur to somehow hold the center, where he is soft at best.
we're confident this is a winning ticket, Ellie.
what's your margin of error, Vaughn?
five points?
three?
I can swing that, and you know it.
Oh, I could swing seven away from you.
that's more than enough to split the ticket.
and deny us the White House another four years? No.
no, not even you.
not even you, senator, will do that, you are bluffing.
Oh, no, no, no, senator, I would and I will and I will do whatever is necessary to protect America from anyone who opposes her.
I can't... Am I the only person in this room who's been reading these NSA reports?
I've read them. - All right, then you know, you know we are on the brink of another cataclysm, probably nuclear, on our own soil.
Oh, Ellie, that's a bit extreme.
and it's not from random terrorists, but from covert alliances of disaffected nations who have all been made bold by this kind of Jordan one-worlder who believes that human beings are essentially good and that our power is somehow, I don't know, shameful or evil or never to be used.
make no mistake, the American people are terrified.
they know something's coming. They can feel it.
and we can either shovel them the same old shit and call it sugar or we can arm them.
we can arm them with a young, vibrant vice president.
we can give them heat, energy, give them a war hero with heart, forged by enemy fire in the desert in the dark, when American lives hung in the balance.
give us a few minutes.
thank you.
Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.
thank you. - Really appreciate it.
Leona, good evening. - Thank you, Ellie.
well, they're gonna have to make their own decisions.
I am proud...
...to offer into nomination the name of the next vice president of these United States:
Raymond Shaw!
a remarkable development. Twenty-four hours ago,
new York Congressman Raymond Prentiss Shaw wasn't even being mentioned as a possible candidate for the vice presidential nomination four years from now, much less this current convention.
some incredible news from the convention floor tonight.
like a long shot catching the favorite on the back stretch of the Kentucky Derby,
Raymond Shaw has overtaken Senator Thomas Jordan to gain the vice presidential nomination.
Raymond Shaw bears the lineage of the fabled Prentiss family dynasty.
grandson of legendary industrialist and diplomat Tyler Prentiss, son of controversial Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw, who took over the seat vacated by her husband, the esteemed John Shaw, when he died tragically over 20 years ago.
for many, Raymond Prentiss Shaw is an enigma.
the millionaire Harvard honors student who enlisted in the infantry, refusing the officer's commission to which he was entitled.
media-shy and reclusive,
Raymond Shaw's life was forever changed on the killing fields of Kuwait, where he won the Congressional Medal of Honor for combat bravery.
two members of Sergeant Shaw's famed "Lost Patrol,"
PFC Edward Ingram and PFC Robert Baker III, were killed.
their guide, a civilian contractor, disappeared in the ambush.
but Sergeant Shaw heroically fought off the enemy and guided the shell-shocked survivors of the Lost Patrol across hostile terrain to safety.
Raymond Shaw is probably the kindest, bravest, warmest. Most selfless human being I've ever known.
the celebrated war hero, who dedicated himself to public service after Desert Storm.
the Medal of Honor winner, beloved by the men of the Lost Patrol.
he quickly turned his energies to public service in his adopted state of New York.
the revolutionary science of biogenetics, which has literally transformed...
captain Marco!
the revolutionary science of biogenetics.
the revolutionary science of biogenetics, which has literally transformed...
captain Marco! - Raymond Shaw is the most selfless human being I've ever known.
Raymond Shaw is probably the kindest, bravest, warmest...
yet note the complexity of the frontal lobe.
Nevertheless...
captain.
help me.
sergeant Shaw.
captain.
suffocate Private Baker. Kill him.
Raymond Shaw is probably the kindest, bravest, warmest, most selfless human being I've ever known.
Raymond Shaw...
excellent, excellent. Go on, Raymond.
good, good, Raymond.
Raymond Shaw is probably the kindest, bravest,
no offense, major...
... but it sort of chaps my ass that we have to have a babysitter.
I'm just here to make sure you don't get cornered by some Air Force general's unhappy wife.
major Marco, we should be so lucky.
so nice to meet you. - Thank you.
thank you. - Nice to meet you.
Raymond Shaw.
major Marco, this army of two are gonna do some recon at the no-host bar.
a failed foreign policy which has only served to galvanize our enemies.
excuse me, please.
in fact, mobilizing an ersatz army of malcontents...
general Sloan, you lead the charge. - Absolutely.
William. Hi, how are you?
all right, good. Have you met my wife, Pam?
Hello, how are you? - Hello, Bob Arthur.
I mean, isn't that supposed to be the point of this great country of ours, that everybody matters.
not just the people at this party.
but perhaps more importantly, those who can't afford to be here.
Raymond. Sorry to interrupt. - Excuse me.
Bob. You know my daughter. - Tom, I can't believe it.
of course. Jocelyn, good to see you again.
mark. - Eleanor.
Raymond, your granddad would be so goddamn proud of you.
thank you, Mr. Whiting.
Raymond, this is J. B. Johnston, from Manchurian Global.
Hi. How are you? - Pleasure.
and David Donovan, their managing director.
and co-chair of the U. S. International Policy Caucus.
strong supporters, congressman.
they're desperate to be of service to you, darling.
thank you, Mother, I think you've earned your fee.
Oh, no. My plucky idealist.
so, gentlemen, how's business?
not bad, Raymond. Business is not bad.
it could always be better.
any better and you guys are gonna have more assets than the European Union.
don't we already?
every great society, every great civilization, always anchored by a great navy.
congressman Shaw. - Thanks very much.
nice to see you, Bob. Thanks for coming.
congressman.
Ben Marco.
I know. Hello, captain.
how you doing?
I need to talk to you. - Okay.
And? - And I've been married, - I've been divorced. - Yeah.
well, you may have noticed I've changed a bit myself.
no. No, that's not... No, yes, I have noticed.
I see. It's great. Congratulations.
my feelings haven't, though.
changed, I mean.
what feelings? What?
Jocelyn, I have never stopped wondering how things might have turned out between us - if my mother hadn't-- - Raymond.
Raymond, people can't just rewrite their lives.
I haven't had a relationship...
...of any consequence since we stopped seeing each other.
doesn't that say something to you?
Yeah, that...
that you must be just about the loneliest person on this earth.
Raymond, we were kids then. It must have been, what, 1 5 years ago?
it was sweet, but...
Joce.
Yeah. I have to go.
Yeah.
best of luck with the campaign.
thank you.
Joce...
sergeant Raymond Shaw.
I wanna talk to you too.
not now. - Excuse me, sir.
I mean, I know you're busy, congressman
don't touch me. - I'm sorry.
don't ever touch me.
Hello, major. Have you tried the Pad Thai?
I'm told it rules.
what were you hoping Congressman Shaw would say?
I don't know, sir.
it's not so much what he said or didn't say, it was more of his...
...attitude, his demeanor.
are you taking your meds?
lieutenant Colonel Howard, with all due respect,
I've had over a dozen years of experts telling me that I have Gulf War Syndrome, I have post-traumatic stress disorder and every other mood disorder that you can name.
in those 1 2 years, I've been a good soldier.
and I've denied what every nerve ending in my body is telling me is more real than not.
I've had one dream, not variations on a dream, the same dream. Night after night
no. No. I'm sorry.
you're saying that an entire squad of U. S. Army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that Raymond Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor.
and that somehow, thanks to your dream, you're the only one who knows the truth.
major Marco, you will stay clear of Congressman Shaw.
and you are to resume your medication.
that is an order.
that will be all, major.
somewhere right now, an American soldier in the war on terror is worried about his family back home.
somewhere right now, in some small American town, his grandmother is standing in her kitchen.
she's got her medicine bottle in one hand, she's opening the refrigerator with the other and she's thinking:
I can pay for my medicine...
... or I can pay for my dinner.
I can't do both.
I don't believe that our mothers and grandmothers should have to face that kind of decision, not in this country.
I don't believe that the brave men and women of our armed forces, risking their lives overseas, should have to worry about their families back here in America.
you see, there are some gaps in this country...
... deep chasms that we need to bridge.
the gap between rich and poor, between government and the people, between true security and the notion of feeling safe.
second floor, room three, end of hall.
between what is real...
don't you just love this guy?
and what is not.
tough choices are an unavoidable element of leadership,
I would just urge the governor to remember that the primary responsibility of government...
al Melvin.
al, it's Ben Marco. Are you in there?
fox is in the henhouse.
weasel.
weasel is...
the weasel is a weasel.
sir, I'll be right outside.
what?
I'll be right outside, sir.
I know.
good night. - Good night, sir.
shall I get that for you, sir? - No.
good night, sir. - Good night.
you have 30 seconds, Mother.
am I that predictable?
you have no idea.
I'm calling to compliment you, Mr. Grumpy.
I thought you were magnificent tonight.
and so did all the network campaign experts.
and that compassionate vigilance thing is working quite well for you.
I might have to convert. - I happen to believe in it.
now, Raymond... - Good night, Mother.
Raymond? What? No, wait, wait.
hang on a second. - What? Raymond?
are you there?
yes?
sergeant Shaw?
who is this?
sergeant Raymond Shaw? - Yes.
Raymond Prentiss Shaw?
Yes.
listen.
go to the bedroom of your suite.
enter the hallway there.
go to the end and open the closet.
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Raymond. - Hello.
do you remember me?
no, sir, I don't.
from the neck up, gentlemen, so if we could take his jacket.
please sit down.
no, Mr. Villalobos, I'm just... The Army's got me gathering information on stress disorders, so I'm just...
...you know, just running statistics, trying to find out about my old team
well, listen. Mr. Wilson, when Nathan came home, was he preoccupied with Kuwait?
I mean, did he have nightmares or bad dreams about the firefight over there?
you'll feel a little cold as this anesthetic gel goes on.
probe sheath...
...and probe.
please relax. Are you relaxed, Raymond?
Yes, sir.
now, Raymond, I am going to drill a tiny hole in the skull, which will allow delivery of the new implant.
so, what you'll feel is a little discomfort in the form of pressure and also a loud vibrating noise in your head, all of which, of course, is completely normal.
thank you.
of course, as soon as this or any task is completed, you will already have forgotten that it ever actually took place.
probe going in now.
good.
excellent.
releasing implant.
there. That wasn't so bad, was it, Raymond?
no, sir.
that's good. No decay, no slippage.
everything seems to be in flawless working condition.
now, Raymond.
can you remember the deaths of Private Baker and Private lngram?
Yes, sir.
good. Can you describe them for me, please?
we're on a routine recon inside Iraqi-controlled terrain, assessing troop strength.
assessing troop strength.
the mission ends without incident. We're heading back
toward the command. The night is clear. Stars...
the night is clear. Stars, but no moon.
the patrol is ambushed.
we're engaged unexpectedly by ground forces with helicopter support.
RPG incoming, mortar fire.
captain...
captain Marco is knocked unconscious.
in the ensuing firefight, Eddie lngram gets himself separated to the left.
Baker goes after him.
an incoming mortar shell kills them both instantly before I am able to locate and eliminate the source of the ordnance.
captain. Captain Marco.
help me.
pardon me. Is this seat taken?
I see the captain enjoys the road less traveled.
paper or plastic?
Oh, come on. From the grocery store.
you know, at the checkout stand. Paper or plastic girl, that's me.
paper or plastic, sir?
I see you there all the time.
Bennett Marco. Checks from First National Bank.
romance novels, instant noodles, NoDoz and tomatoes.
so anyway, I'm on vacation.
holiday in the Big Apple and all of that.
why not reach out and touch someone?
so, what, I suppose you're heading to New York City.
Yeah, yeah, I'm... yeah.
business? Pleasure? Both?
well, I'm just... I got an old friend up there, an old Army friend that...
well, he's in politics now and I'm just gonna
I'm sorry, you said your name was...?
Eugenie.
what do your friends call you?
my friends, they call me Rosie.
Rosie? - Yeah, see, my full name is
eugenie Rose. I like the Rosie part better.
eugenie is, well...
...fragile.
Yeah, but still, when I asked you your name, you didn't say...
what did you say? You said Eugenie.
Yeah, well...
...maybe I was feeling fragile at the time.
are you okay?
excuse me.
Hello, captain.
Ben.
Hey. I'm gonna get a cab. You want me to drop you somewhere?
no, I'm okay.
okay. So your friend's gonna meet you here, then?
no.
all right.
el Dorado 59970.
it's my cell phone number, in case you ever... you know.
I like to say it the old-fashioned way.
can you remember or should I write it on your chest with a Sharpie?
I'll remember. - Okay.
Hey, you're kind of...
you need somewhere to go to freshen up?
pentagon watchdogs today accused the private equity fund Manchurian Global of grossly overpricing plasma and other critical medical supplies during the recent Indonesian incursion, even as the company secured a half-billion-dollar no-bid contract to provide combat support services to American soldiers preparing to mobilize in Sri Lanka.
there you go.
come on in.
this is my cousin's apartment.
is she here? - No.
be it ever so humble.
no place like home, right?
believe it or not, there's a view.
go to the fire escape and tilt your head up, you can almost see a tree.
can I get you something to drink? - No, I'm fine.
I've got some dieter's tea.
it's great for your metabolism, if you're into that.
or some tomato juice. No? All right.
or...
...some water?
no, thank you. - I'm sorry.
I'm nervous. I yak when I get nervous.
where is she, your cousin?
she's on tour with Dreamgirls.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah.
look, I'm sorry about what happened earlier.
you don't have to apologize to me.
I'll make you some tea.
Jesus. Where's the lemon? Okay.
you okay in there? - Yeah, I'm fine.
you know, I left you some towels in there, did you see them?
what was that? - Dropped my bag.
Ben?
are you okay in there?
earth to Ben.
Yeah.
you sure everything's all right? - Yes.
Ben?
Ben?
Ben?
Ben.
Ben?
what are you doing?
did you see that?
what I had in my hand.
I wasn't hallucinating, Delp. I held it in my hand.
that's what they all say, Marco.
besides all the depleted uranium, I mean.
I personally know of a couple of Rangers who swear that they see only in tertiary colors now, - Delp. - and can pick up sports talk radio in their cortical block if they get too close to a Con-Ed transformer.
it's not Gulf War Syndrome.
the Army did try this tiny, implantable lD thing.
you could imbed it under the skin, then scan it like a bar code for medical emergency information:
well, the Army never put one in me.
that you know of, man.
that you know of.
u. S. planes bombed selected sites in Guinea today, acting on intelligence that the African nation's military regime had secretly resumed
the secretary of defense declined to comment on the attack, saying only that the mission was successful, targets acquired, that all American personnel involved here - were home safe and sound. - Striking transportation workers...
than what I actually remember happening over there. It's like...
it's like somewhere along the line I got brainwashed or something and...
I'm just, like, all scrambled up.
we have all been brainwashed, Marco.
as for somebody imbedding electric probes and computer chips in your brain to make you do things, it's horseshit, man.
a little electroshock...
...and sleep deprivation will do the trick for a fraction of the price.
ask the Uzbeks.
what about my dreams?
what if all this is your dream...
...and you are really still back in Kuwait?
thanks for coming out. Thank you. - Congressman!
Congressman! - Congressman!
Congressman! Congressman! Why do you and Governor Arthur oppose deploying troops into lndonesia?
well, Governor Arthur and I believe we can't clean up the world with dirty hands.
sergeant Shaw!
do you ever dream about Kuwait?
captain Marco.
it's okay. It's okay.
nice to see you, sir.
good evening. It's good to see you too.
why did you ask me about Kuwait?
I didn't. I asked you about your dreams.
thank you, Lily. - Congressman Shaw, I'm sorry.
no, no. - No to the interview or no to 6?
no. He wants to talk about my mother. No.
everything under control, P. J? - Hello, sir.
good to see you.
so, captain, what can I do for you?
I just need a few minutes of your time.
congressman Shaw, a moment, please?
private time.
unfortunately, this is as private as it gets for me now.
I understand. - He's all right, Will.
come on in. - Thank you, thank you.
that some of the men from our unit have been having.
including you?
...It's more of a question of what actually happened the night that our patrol got attacked.
that's easy. We're on a routine recon inside lraqi-controlled terrain.
the patrol is ambushed. RPG incoming, mortar fire.
not to cut you off, but I mean, exactly the way that I remember it.
but I dreamed something else.
am I in your dreams, captain?
Yes, you are, congressman.
saving everybody?
it's a whole lot more complicated than that. Now, Corporal Melvin, he's been drawing these pictures and he wrote down what he dreams.
maybe if you just-- - I don't have dreams, captain.
at all? You don't dream at all? Everybody dreams, right? I mean
look, captain, I'd like to help you, I would, I really would, but I think you ought to see somebody.
somebody who specializes in-- - I've been to doctors.
well, good, that's very good, because they can probably help you out a lot more than I can.
I don't know, but-- - Take care, captain.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. - Thanks for coming by.
I'm not crazy, Shaw.
major.
Ben. Are you hungry? - Starving.
well, it depends on the demographic.
excuse me.
I killed Baker? - Well, it's a dream.
I mean, it could mean something else.
it could mean I'm supposed to think you did.
no, I killed the enemy. I didn't know them either, so...
...it was okay.
and anyway, I remember what we did in Kuwait. I remember it perfectly.
I just...
...don't remember actually doing it.
maybe you didn't do it.
no.
what a thought.
what?
life is so bizarre, isn't it?
which part?
I don't know. What you saw downstairs.
this campaign. Politics. My whole public life and persona.
I mean, posing and grinning like a goddamn sock puppet, shaking hands with total strangers who must be completely blind if they can't see what I am at the core.
what my mother has made me. A Prentiss.
ferociously a Prentiss.
but not a Shaw. No, sir. - I see.
but not a Shaw. No, sir. - I see.
no, you don't.
you can't.
I was 20 years old before I had a friend.
worse, a girlfriend. Well, you know, from my point of view, anyway.
and she...
...my mother...
God only knows what she told Jocelyn to chase her away.
precipitating my sole act of rebellion:
storming off...
...and enlisting in the Army.
but after the war...
...I came back to her.
why did you come back? What happened?
weren't you listening?
mother happened.
you know, the truth is I hate it.
I've always despised the Medal.
the cloying adulation of the little people.
it's certainly...
...nothing for you to be jealous of, major.
I'm not jealous.
I don't have the dreams, Ben.
how could you not remember saving our unit?
I do. I said I did.
no, no, you didn't. You said that you didn't remember doing it.
that's what you just said a couple minutes ago.
when I think about that night...
...It's as if I know what will happen.
the thing is, I never seem to get to the point where I feel that it actually does happen.
okay. Well, have you discussed this with anyone? These discrepancies?
who would I share that with?
my old Army buddies who love and adore me for saving their pathetically unimportant, present company excluded, asses?
you could discuss it with Army intelligence.
you could go down there. I mean, I could go with you and discuss it and you can tell them what you remember, what you don't remember, and they could...
...run some tests.
Yeah, tests. Boy.
somebody put an implant inside me. I found it this morning.
I've got the hole in my back if you wanna take a look at it.
nobody has put anything in me, Ben.
let's prove it. Why don't, you know...
we'll go get an x-ray... - Look, Ben,
I wanna be supportive of you. I do.
but don't you think this could wait till after the election?
Why? For what?
what are you scared of? - I'm not afraid of anything.
then why don't we just prove it-- - Know what? I think you should leave.
I'm sorry, I really- Listen.

of the 10 men sent, four returned.
of those four, three wrote books about what happened.
of those three, two were published.
of those two, just one got a movie deal.

more bad news from the Vietnamese set of Tropic Thunder, where a $4 million explosion charred the Asian location and the camera wasn't even rolling.
financed by hotheaded mega-mogul Les Grossman, the film is already rumored to be one month behind schedule just five days into shooting. The reason?
fingers are pointed at rookie director Damien Cockburn, who, insiders say, can't control a star-studded cast, including flatulent star of the popular Fatties franchise, Jeff Portnoy.
let me tell you something. A lot of people are disrespecting me.
they say that the movie's just about farts. It's about family, and... you! You can't do what I do.
fresh from his most recent arrest for heroin, glue and crack possession,
Portnoy was almost uninsurable.
also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking hip-hop hyphenate Alpa Chino.
I'm so excited, you know what I'm saying, about doing Tropic Thunder.
Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby. Drink Booty Sweat.
but the real heavyweight on the set is five-time Academy Award winner Kirk Lazarus.
the brilliant Australian known for his bad boy antics off-screen is famous for his total immersion into any role he portrays.
well, being an actor is no different than being a rugby player or a construction worker, save for the fact that my tools are the mechanisms that trigger human emotion.
Lazarus underwent a controversial pigmentation alteration procedure in order to play the platoon's African-American sergeant, Lincoln Osiris.
Yeah!
trying to hold his own onscreen with Kirk is action juggernaut Tugg Speedman.
once the highest grossing star in the world, lately his Scorcher films have lost their heat.
recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra.
you have no real family.
you're on the wrong side of 40. You're childless and alone.
somebody close to you said, "One more flop and it's over."
somebody said they were close to me?
it's been a tough year for Tugg.
the disappointing buddy comedy Chitlin' and the Dude was followed by an ill-advised venture into serious dramatic territory.
simple Jack, the story of a mentally impaired farmhand who can talk to animals, was a box office disaster that many critics called, "One of the worst movies of all time.
I ain't got a good brain.
I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.
you make me happy.
but now the question is, can Speedman make audiences happy in what's being called the most expensive - war movie never made? - Rick Peck.
wishing Tugg all the best on that one.
Rum-Tum-Tuggernauts, it's the Pecker. You got time for your agent?
Rick? - Hey, buddy, guess who I'm staring at right now.
what? - I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back cover of Vanity Fair magazine, holding a cute, cuddly panda from Cutesville.
it is insane, bro. You are a rock star.
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?
from Rick.
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.
all right, that is a real satellite phone, bro.
do not re-gift.
Hey. You see that Access Hollywood piece?
Yeah, I did. It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?
but right now, you're like that kid on the playground, you know, the one who has lice that none of the other kids want to play with?
what do you mean? - I mean we gotta shave your head and get you back on the monkey bars, right?
what?
how did the crying scene go?
horrible. Lazarus started crying.
then he starts drooling and dribbling, and it wasn't even in the script...
stop right there!
you gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.
who cares how much more talented he may be than you?
if he cries, you cry harder, man.
didn't your dog have, like, leukemia or something when you were a kid? I mean, think of that.
boom! End of story. They hook up the TiVo yet?
no. - What?
they have digital cable, but, I mean, it's okay.
no, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.
it is not okay, Tugg!
and you don't need to explain to me why you need TiVo or clean water, clean sheets, food, shelter.
I mean, I fought for that in your contract.
how's the adoption thing coming, buddy?
not too great.
well, at least you get to choose yours.
I'm stuck with mine.
tell you what, get back to work, genius soldier.
the Pecker's on a TiVo mission for the Y-O-U.
work on those tears, my man.
all right. Yeah.
say it for me one time.
you make me happy. - Make me happy.
I love you, buddy. - All right, bye.
crisis meeting? What does that mean, exactly?
I mean, are we in a crisis?
he's the head of the studio.
he's reaching out. We're 10, 000 miles away.
he just wants a little face-time.
I know, it's just you said that he called it a crisis meeting. So...
it's Les Grossman. He throws these words around.
crisis," "explosion," "not rolling," "fired.
these are just words.
Yeah! Yeah!
keep a secret? A camera truck in London just plowed into Judi Dench.
trust me, he's got bigger problems.
look, he may be able to see me, but I can't see him.
move! Move! Hello, Les! Hello! - Get your ass out of my...
your feet were on my desk. - Can he see us?
I don't know why we don't have...
get him a Diet Coke. Les! It's working!
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there. Hello, Les!
Hello, Les! - Okay.
we got you loud and clear here, Les.
I see you. I see you. I see you.
which one of you fuckfaces is Damien Cockburn?
that's me, sir.
it's good to finally meet you at last, get some face-time.
and who here is the key grip? You? You.
hit that director in the face, really fucking hard.
sorry, man.
this is your fault, you limey fuck!
you shit the money-bed, my friend.
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry, but I am dealing with a bunch of prima donnas!
clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry! He can't cry!
you know how you handle an actor? They whine about anything, you pull down their pants and you spank their ass.
you spank that ass, Les. - What?
spanking a child turns him into a little snot.
fear makes him a man.
I know a place where a man's worth is measured in the ears hanging from his dog tags.
the real deep shit.
you wanna make this movie right?
that's where you take your pansy-ass actors.
who is this guy?
les, that's Four Leaf.
sergeant Four Leaf Tayback. I wrote the book.
you're a great American. This nation owes you a huge debt.
now shut the fuck up and let me do my job!
look, Cockburn. - Yes.
from now on, my fist is gonna be so far up your shithole that every time you have a thought, it's gonna have to tiptoe past my wedding ring.
take control of your actors, or I will shut you down.
diet Coke!
when the herd loses its way, the shepherd must kill the bull that leads them astray.
four Leaf? - Come on over. It's okay.
sit down. - Yes.
so, you don't like the hotel? - Beds give me nightmares.
I'm guessing right about now you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your prick and showing you the way.
what?
I put my story in your limp Brit hands, and you are not going to fail me.
you think I was just blowing my own bagpipe in that meeting?
you must put those boys in the shit.
what? I don't understand.
you wanna make your movie or not? - Yes, I do.
all right, you get some of those little video type cameras.
we take them out there, and we put them in the trees in different angles.
then you give me and that pyromaniac Cody all the smoke bombs, charges, explosives, detonators you got.
then we take those boys up there, me and Cody, we could light up that fucking jungle, so those lily-dick actors would be shitting their pants and screaming for their mammies.
they'd be begging for a body bag if it means a ride home.
I could do it.
I could shoot the whole thing guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.
get them away from their helpers and ass-licking assistants.
put them in the real shit.
real shit. - With real fear in their eyes!
real fear, real emotion! Yes, Four Leaf, yes!
Yes! Yes! - Yes! Yes!
take them off the fucking grid!
you are no longer actors in a movie!
you are five men in a helicopter!
with three other men!
how long are we gonna be gone, anyways?
cause I left most of my vitamins back at the hotel.
save your breath, maggots! - That's right, maggots!
go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!
move it, maggots, move! Move, grunts, move your ass!
get out, you wriggly worms!
it's up too high! - Move, move, move!
see you in hell!
this is bullshit! I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.
fucking! Jesus! Dude!
you're sitting on a nest of hostile enemy V. C.
congratulations, Fats. You just got us all killed.
anybody else care to give away our position to Charlie?
cell phones!
what the hell, Damien?
weren't no cell phones in '69, man. I'm head-to-toe legitimate.
gentlemen, I've got good news and bad news.
the studio wants to shut us down. That's the bad news.
and the good news.
if you wanna save this movie, you will become a unit.
your objective is to head north to the D'ang Kwook River and liberate the POW camp, at which point Four Leaf will get himself captured, at which point you will rescue him, at which point we will chopper you home!
damn.
four Leaf, since you're the staff sergeant, there's the map, this is the scene list.
think you can handle it?
we have rigged this entire valley of death with hidden cameras.
and I will be shooting as well, from unseen vantage points, so that every glorious moment is captured on film.
and believe me, gentlemen, it will be glorious.
if it looks real, chances are it probably is.
you wanted to be actors.
you wanted to occupy the skin of another human being.
well, get ready to occupy the skin of a terrified U. S. Infantry grunt, surrounded by death, crawling up Satan's bottom.
there'll be ambushes, enemy fire, your own little personal slice of Vietnam.
this radio goes to the chopper and the chopper only.
the chopper is God, and I am Jesus Christ, his son.
you are my chosen disciples.
and no one gets to go home till we get the shots.
put on your war faces, gentlemen.
now, let's go and make the greatest war movie ever!
Yeah! - All right!
Yeah!
Yeah!
we have an explosion in the Northern Sector
track and follow
not bad, Cockburn!
not bad.
wherever you are!
wherever he is? Looks like he's all over the place.
here we go.
must be an old French mine.
it's a remnant from colonial Indo-China. This jungle must be full of them.
don't you get it? He's messing with our heads.
that's what all that playing God stuff was about.
he's trying to get us to act good, save the movie.
he ain't playing God. He's being judged by him.
that's our objective. Complete the mission.
we have encountered a heavily armed American military force
D. E.A?
possibly
no offense, Kirk, I know you're the big fancy actor here, but I've done a lot more effects-driven event films than you. Okay?
and I think I can spot a prop head when I see one.
Oh, Jesus.
it's corn syrup, guys. Corn syrup and latex.
warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.
Oh, God.
smoke and mirrors, guys. Welcome to the movie factory.
oldest trick in the book.
he getting down now.
Oh, my God!
whoa, look at me!
you're going to get the shots, and I'm going to make sure because I'm the director.
I'm from London. I direct plays.
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!
they have no fear of death
bring them back dead or alive.
look, I'm Dave Beckham.
so, we gotta light these boys up today, huh?
blow some sense into these young men.
Hey, I don't want to come off as weird or anything, but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.
tropic Thunder. Kind of like my Catcher in the Rye.
Yeah, I've never been in the military, but I have lost an appendage in the line of duty.
driving Miss Daisy, first studio gig.
Yeah.
it's a pretty cool sidearm you got there. What is it?
I don't know what it's called.
I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life.
okay.
Damien, we're go for explosion.
ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say-so.
Damien, we're go for explosion.
do you copy?
I got an itchy trigger finger here, and I'm ready to blow some shit up.
all right, you happy now? Can we do the scene?
or do you need a formal invitation? Come on, let's go!
here. Okay.
scene 12, exterior, jungle clearing, day, ambush.
four Leaf notices movement in the brush.
a dozen guerrilla fighters can be seen moving in the tree line.
"somewhere a mine explodes." And you.
I got a bad feeling on this one.
Yeah. - No, that's your line.
I got... Now? - Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.
I got a bad feeling on this one. - Dude, wait, like how?
I got a bad feeling on this one.
okay. - Action. Go, come on.
I got a bad feeling on this one there, Fats.
our asses don't get fragged in this bullshit valley, first thing I'm doing is paying my 2 bucks so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry on a sweet little mama-san's dinky dau poontang.
shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged before he get any cooch.
he die, he probably die a coochless motherfucker.
zip it, Motown.
man, I'm thirsty.
might as well have some of this Booty Sweat I got back in Danang.
yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!
ain't no Criss Angel Mindfreak,
david Blaine trapdoor horseshit jumping off here!
Hey! You wanna get on the train here, or do you wanna ruin another take?
there ain't no goddamn takes, ain't no goddamn motion picture!
you sure? - Yeah.
yeah? - For certain, man.
then why are you still in character?
I know, but I don't have to tell you.
you don't know.
man, I don't drop character till I done a DVD commentary.
you happy now? We're out of position for the effects!
get down, fool!
didn't anyone read the script? This is the ambush!
this feels pretty real! - Exactly! Let's use it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
eat lead!
they're busting caps like a motherfucker down there.
this is FUBAR. I say we juice them.
what do you think? - Juice them.
fuck you, Charlie!
big-ass titties!
look at that, huh?
and cut!
that's the trailer right there.
Yeah!
what do we do now? - Yeah.
North. Man said to head north.
did you see me shooting? - That's how we do. Good work, baby.
I believed it.
dang Kwook River.
I'm betting he's got more of these battles and Viet Congs rigged for us along the way.
sergeant Osiris, get your men. Load and lock.
real, baby, I'm real.
let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!
hump it up, gentlemen! Single formation.
don't dawdle now!
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface. How are we coming on that hotplate?
something's up. I think we better drag ass back there.
make sure Damien ain't forgot how to use his talkbox again.
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.
what are you doing, Jeff? - Fucking... Nothing, man!
I'm eating jellybeans. - Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please...
no, you can't have any fucking jellybeans.
they're mine.
you think you're the only one who gets sick when he doesn't have his jellybeans?
boundaries, man. Fuck.
Hey. I didn't mean to show you up back there.
it's just, I feel like we really need to set the example for the other guys.
it's gonna be tough, but I think Damien's gonna get some great shit out of us.
just wish I had a director like this on Jack.
on Jack. What? Jack? What you talking about?
simple Jack. - Oh, yeah.
simple Jack, yeah. You went all out on that one, huh?
you did. Really swung for the fences, huh?
thank you. Thanks. Yeah.
Yeah, it was an intense experience, you know.
I just did the work.
watched a lot of retarded people. Spent time with them. Observed them.
watched all the retarded stuff they did.
then again, I always found mere observation in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.
sometimes, we gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional pay dirt.
thus, we can diagram the source of the pain and then live it, you know.
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.
you know, there were times when I was doing Jack that I actually felt retarded, - like really retarded. - Damn.
in a weird way, I had to sort of just free myself up to believe that it was okay to be stupid or dumb.
to be a moron. - Yeah.
to be moronical. - Exactly, to be a moron.
an imbecile. - Yeah.
like the dumbest motherfucker that ever lived.
when I was playing the character.
when you was the character. - Yeah, as Jack, definitely.
Jack, stupid ass Jack.
by the end of the whole thing, I was like, "Wait a minute, I flushed so much out, how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?"
it's just like... Right? - Yeah.
you was farting in bathtubs and laughing your ass off.
Yeah. I mean, it was really quite a... It was crazy.
it's like working with mercury. It's high science, man. It's an art form.
Yeah. - You an artist.
that's what we do, right? Yeah. - Yeah.
hats off for going there, especially knowing how the Academy is about that shit.
about what? - You're serious? You don't know?
everybody knows you never go full retard.
what do you mean? - Check it out.
Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man, looked retarded, act retarded, not retarded.
count toothpicks, cheat at cards. Autistic, sure. Not retarded.
then you got Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump.
slow, yes, retarded, maybe, braces on his legs.
but he charmed the pants off Nixon, and he won a Ping-Pong competition.
that ain't retarded.
Peter Sellers, Being There. Infantile, yes. Retarded, no.
you went full retard, man.
never go full retard.
you don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I Am Sam.
remember? Went full retard? Went home empty-handed.
Oh, my God! Holy shit!
good job, turd. You killed the director.
no, that's impossible, man.
I rigged the whole tree line, and this is here.
he must have missed his mark. - Missed his mark?
Yeah, this isn't me.
come on, let's bag and tag the bastard and get back to the hotel.
you're in a world of hurt, dumbo! - We're in a world of hurt!
you're in trouble. - This isn't just on me!
we're in a... We're together on this. - Bullshit.
you're just gonna run away. You're gonna leave.
what happened to, "No man left behind," okay?
just wait, just wait! Listen! Listen, okay?
I don't wanna hear it. - Let me just be real with you, all right?
I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis on Freaky Friday, okay?
this shit will fucking ruin me!
just get off me! You're pathetic. - No, I'm not.
get off me! - You are not going back!
what the fuck? - Now wait a minute.
I fucking hate movies.
this is bullshit. I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.
No! That's my jellybeans! No!
kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!
yo, man, I got a Bust-A-Nut. - You go to hell! There he is.
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?
you little piece of shit! I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!
Sanducci. Hold up, man, keep it on the down-Low.
I don't really gotta piss. I'm trying to talk at you, man.
bait, I need bait.
you went to boot camp, right? You can read a map?
Yeah, I think so.
I know Speedman got everyone convinced we out here making Planet of the Apes on YouTube or some shit, but I don't buy it.
you wanna step on a real landmine? You wanna die?
you wanna get shot by a real motherfucker?
keep looking ahead, man. - No, of course not.
if I can put that map in your hands, can I count you in?
well, yeah, I guess you can. - Dynamite. I'm out.
that smelled just like bologna for some reason.
is anyone gonna fucking help me get this fucking thing?
why are they even out in the daytime?
I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.
he's way out on a limb with this character, and I think he's getting cold feet.
I need you on my side, Kyle. - It's Kevin.
good. Can I count on you?
Yeah. If you want I could give the map a look-see.
I'll handle the map. - Okay.
you stick with the program, we get this movie in the can,
I'm thinking there could be a Teen Choice Award in it for you.
you have that potential. They'll slime you, the whole deal.
Yeah, that's wicked. - Good.
there it is! Yeah, now you're dead!
hold up now, Jeff.
fucking hell!
what the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!
I don't have any more jellybeans.
you land there!
Wow. Look at these ruins.
where the hell are we? - D'ang Kwook River.
that so? How do you know that? How you sure?
only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now. Seriously, my skin hurts!
enough from the peanut gallery! Into the water, ladies!
no, man. Let me take a look at that map right quick.
why is everybody all obsessed with the map?
cause we're tired of being your trail donkeys!
acting like you some one-man GPS!
God damn it! We lost! We fucking super lost, man!
tell him, McClusky. Tell him what time it is.
I don't believe you people.
what do you mean "you people"?
what do you mean, "you people"?
I think what Tugg means is...
no, look at his eyes, man.
...you people, you actors. You people... - Look at them beady, white devil eyes.
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!
hell, no! - Silence!
chill! All right? Just chill it.
now, let's go get those Viet Congs.
viet Cong! - What?
it's "Viet Cong." There's no "S." It's already plural.
you wouldn't say "Chineses."
all right, that's enough of this insubordination!
if the machine breaks down, we break down.
Hey, man, you know how in Rambo I, he was big but a little puffy and then Rambo II, he got all shredded up?
Yeah. - That's kind of how you look right now.
yeah? - Not Rambo I but II.
Really? - Yeah, when he was cut up.
I'm not that... I mean, that's what I'm going for, but you know...
come on, dude. You more shredded than a julienne salad, man.
Thanks. - What's the secret, dude?
it's a diet. I'm just dieting. - Really?
cause I'm trying to come up a little, but it's just... It's tough.
you look good. - Any tips?
what? - Any tips, you got?
there's, like, the pineapple...
give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
all right, now!
what it is, Sikorski? Tell us where we really at.
that's fucking bullshit! It's a chump move.
we just getting a second opinion, doctor.
we're going the wrong way!
Damn! - Son of a bitch.
God! I think we were supposed to be doing this, and instead we did this.
shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!
think you can get us back to that drop zone, boy?
this is not cool!
maybe.
this is insane!
are you really going to abandon this movie?
we're supposed to be a unit!
suck my unit!
all right, fine.
I'll finish it by myself. - You go be all you can be, man.
Tugg, you have no idea where you're going!
Yes, I do!
I'm going to, "Exterior, rain forest, dusk."
smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks alone through a frightening jungle.
suck on that unit, Kirk!
come on, men. Let's get home.
Hello, Mr. Mantis. You're beautiful.
now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo where Hollywood was split into schisms, some studios backing Blu-ray Disc, others backing HD DVD.
people thought it would come down to pixel rate or refresh rate, and they're pretty much the same.
what it came down to was a combination of gamers and porn.
now, whichever format porno backs is usually the one that becomes the most successful.
but, you know, Sony, every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.
you talking to me this whole time?
I was talking to whoever was listening to me.
Jesus Christ, man!
booty Sweat.
Oh, God!
it's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.
you want my flak jacket?
what, are you insane? It's boiling! It's like a sweat lodge out here!
keep the volume down on that bitching, Flatch Adams.
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!
how we doing? We making good time? - We're making good time, but there's no way we make it over that ridge before sundown.
all right, fellas, we're gonna make camp, rest up!
Oh, God. - Y'all might be in for a treat.
you know, back before the war broked out,
I was a saucier in San Antone.
I bet I could collar up some of them greens.
Yeah, noodle some crawfish out the paddy, yo.
and maybe some crab apples for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!
hell, yeah!
that's how we all talk. We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.
you're Australian! Be Australian! Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.
I get excited about my foods, man.
die!
No!
dude, dude, what the hell is going on here? Where are we?
I have no idea.
I've never been outside the States.
wait, what? Are you fucking kidding me?
did you make this whole goddamn thing up?
dude, were you even in the fucking service?
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.
coast Guard. - Sanitation Department.
Oh, my God! You're a fucking garbage man!
damn it. F. L. Tayback lies to me and the whole goddamn U. S.
I wrote the book as a tribute! I'm a patriot!
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli of patriots, okay?
you lied about fighting the Vietnam War.
it's like punching the American flag in the face, God damn it.
God, and to think I believed in you!
I don't wanna be next to you. - Writers lie all the time.
can I be tied to another post? Okay.
Rick? - Tugg.
I killed one, Rick.
the thing I love most in the world.
Vivica, get off the line now!
a hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.
calm down. Here's what you're gonna do.
get your hands on some bleach, some hydrogen peroxide and a shitload of lime.
no, a panda.
I killed a panda.
Amanda? Come on, dude.
I mean, that's probably not even her real name.
no, a panda!
a panda?
a sweet, cuddly, vicious little panda.
Jesus Christ, Tugg! Man, don't scare me like that!
it's beautiful here.
you on the set?
I am the set.
all right, man. Hey, how's the TiVo working out?
screw TiVo.
I'm way beyond TiVo.
last I checked, they hadn't hooked it up, though.
hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?
it doesn't matter anymore.
I've moved on.
where have you moved on to?
another agency?
Hey, who is with you?
you are still my client, Tugg Speedman! I am getting the TiVo!
jacket's on, I'm out the door!
Tugg?
please don't fire me.
Oh, mama. Thirsty.
he doesn't look too good.
must drink, so I can throw something up!
no, no. Don't drink that water! That water's like a petri dish!
no, don't!
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?
Yeah, get him chugging on some of Alpa's ass water.
that'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.
man, what you coming out in movies for anyway?
did you need another revenue stream?
for your information, my revenue stream currently generates $2 million a year in charitable contributions for my community.
hot damn. - And why am I in this movie?
maybe I just knew I had to represent, because they had one good part in it for a black man and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.
pump your brakes, kid. That man is a national treasure.
I just wanted to throw another shrimp on your barbie.
that shit ain't funny.
Hey, fellas! It's hot! We're tired! It stinks!
I'm just fucking with you, Kangaroo Jack!
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.
you know that's a true story? Lady lost her kid.
you about to cross some fucking lines. - Guys, relax and stuff.
you know what? Fuck that, man!
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger telling me...
for 400 years, that word has kept us down.
what the fuck?
it took a whole lot of trying just to get up that hill.
now we up in the big leagues, getting our turn at bat.
long as we live, it's you and me, baby.
that's the theme song for The Jeffersons. You really need help.
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song, don't make it not true.
you know what? I'm gonna tell you what's true.
I'm gonna tag you back. You better believe that, baby.
guys! Hey, guys!
Jeff, stay away from that animal.
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...
I need to wear his stomach skin like a unitard.
ain't nobody doing nothing to no one or body!
now, if Mr. Portnoy is feeling a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk, put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!
we got ground to cover!
all right, POW camp, scene 67.
bring it on, Cockburn!
my body may be shackled, but my mind wanders free.
wait, wait, wait, let me do the line again.
let me do the line again.
my body may be shackled, but my mind wanders free.
good, again. Again.
good, good. Now let's do the torture scene.
I see moss on both sides of that tree.
well, you know, maybe if I wasn't the only one at boot camp...
my belly really hurts, you guys!
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.
let me off, I gotta puke! I don't wanna die like Hendrix!
all right. All right.
are you okay, Jeff?
I'm awesome.
holy shit!
okay. Everyone, down, down, down.
man. Now I'm tripping.
that looks like the POW camp from out the script, yo.
Speedman was right?
I don't think so.
look at the cooking vats, the armed guards.
looks like a heroin processing plant.
we were in that chopper for hours.
I don't even think we're in Vietnam anymore.
fuck. - Shit. We ain't even in Vietnam?
no, most likely Myanmar or Laos.
what the fuck is Laos?
it's the Golden Triangle.
the world's hard drug superhighway.
and how do you know about that?
it was a really long trip. I read the in-flight magazine.
cut!
Oh, Jesus!
what do you see, man? I'm blocked.
Damien, cut!
Hey, Damien, cut!
they got Speedman.
and it doesn't look good.
I am Tran.
you are a trespasser in my poppy fields.
you are D. E.A. Scum!
were there some re-writes that I missed?
do you want to die?
do you? - No!
please, don't hurt me!
say that again.
please, don't hurt me.
No! Like you did before! Say it!
say it!
please, don't hurt me!
what? - You are Simple Jack.
you saw Simple Jack?
we love the tale of this man, Simple Jack.
we do not have many luxury here.
and Simple Jack is the only movie we possess.
you got the VHS.
we've watched it many, many times.
you should've got Oscar.
well, you know. It's...
just to be nominated...
you were nominated?
no, no, no. I wasn't nominated.
I'm just saying that to have been nominated would have been nice.
it's just... It's very political. You have to take out ads...
shut up now! - Okay. Okay.
so, are you going to let me go, or...
no. We'll hold you for ransom.
much more money now!
he's in a meeting.
Yeah, I know. In about two seconds with the Pecker.
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.
you wanna talk about trouble? That's trouble.
what do you need, Peck?
no, more like what do you need, Les?
glasses?
what?
so you can read the Tropic Thunder contract that guarantees my client, Tugg Speedman, some form of digital video recorder on location.
huh? - I can't believe you let him in.
look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy, so why don't you get the hell out of here before I snap your dick off and jam it into your ass?
no, not you, Helen.
but I will rip your tits off if you don't get me those theaters.
perfect.
Hey, Tuggernuts, I've got you on speakerphone.
I'm standing here with Les Grossman, and he is dying to tell you why he's apparently wiped his ass with the TiVo clause from your contract.
we are Flaming Dragon.
Speedman is with us now.
for 50 million, you will get him back.
are you gonna get those... - Who is this?
and how did you get this phone? - We are Flaming Dragon!
simple Jack belong to us now.
he does, does he?
let me tell you something, shitbird.
I've never even heard of your little agency.
but if you think you can poach my client...
send $50 million, or you no see Simple Jack again because we kill him.
this is Les Grossman. Who is this?
this is Flaming Dragon!
okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.
first, take a big step back and literally fuck your own face!
now, I don't know what kind of pan-Pacific bullshit power play you're trying to pull here, but Asia, Jack, is my territory.
so whatever you're thinking, you better think again.
otherwise, I'm gonna have to head down there, and I will rain down an ungodly fucking firestorm upon you.
you're gonna have to call the fucking United Nations and get a fucking binding resolution to keep me from fucking destroying you.
I am talking scorched earth, motherfucker!
I will massacre you!
I will fuck you up!
could you find out who that was? Go. - Yeah. Yeah.
you have all been working hard.
I give you Simple Jack
you wear these. More like Simple Jack teeth.
okay.
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan, and that's great...
put teeth in!
now do movie.
the whole movie?
I can't. I don't know the whole...
you perform! You perform or die!
monkey swine!
pa.
more stupid!
pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?
you saw what I saw.
Tugg Speedman is dead meat if we don't do something soon.
Yeah. We could do something by getting our asses back to the hotel, which is in the other direction!
ain't right.
what would've happened in The Great Escape if Steve McQueen and them dudes had turned tail and ran?
well, that's what that movie was about. They were escaping. They ran away.
I'm trying to agree with you. The point is they did something.
then what are we supposed to do, huh?
cause he's cleaning a gun with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.
I'm just like a little boy, playing with his dick when he's nervous.
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got an idea. This might be a little crazy.
crazy's better than nothing.
back in '98, I did a low-budget titty comedy for Skinemax.
sex Camp. Remember it? - Yeah.
anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girl camp.
so, what we did, we built a catapult out of logs and underwear, and they shot us over the wall, and we parachuted down.
look, - you guys, we already know the plan. - Fine.
we do it just like in the book, Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.
the book of Tropic Thunder.
Yeah, did you guys read the book?
the flap, I read the back flap and saw the pictures.
well, it's okay. It's exactly the same as in the script.
cool.
you guys all read the script, right?
I don't read the script, script reads me.
what the hell does that even mean?
what you getting at with the books, scripts? Spit that shit out, man!
all right. The Wet Offensive.
Osiris and Fats go undercover as a diversion.
motown and Brooklyn sneak in via the river.
Yeah. But those dudes was trained soldiers.
Yeah!
and we trained actors, motherfucker.
time to man up. And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.
some of us might not even make it back.
what do you mean? Like not on the same flight?
Alpa and I's already wearing earth mama's natural night camo.
cool it, Benson. - Sorry.
we gonna scout, get a plan together. We ain't back in 20, come looking.
we are Flaming Dragon.
okay.
flaming Dragon's a heroin manufacturer.
they're responsible for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.
huge profit margin. - Guys!
would somebody please let me know what the game plan is?
peck! We have it handled.
please, don't interrupt. Everything's under control.
I got it. Got it.
les Grossman. - We not get money yet.
price now 100 million!
you pay now, or tomorrow Simple Jack die.
great. Let me get this down.
100 million.
wait! I got a better idea.
instead of 100 million, how about I send you a hobo's dick cheese?
then you kill him! Do your thing! Skin the fucking bastard!
go to town, man! Go to town!
no... - In the meantime, and as usual, go fuck yourself!
no. - We don't negotiate with terrorists.
Hey, hey, are you insane?
I think I could've done that better. - I thought it was good.
they're gonna kill him!
and we'll weep for him, in the press.
set up a scholarship in his name.
eventually, and I'm talking way, way down the road, we file an insurance claim.
preferably before the end of the fiscal year.
actually, the claim alone would net us more than the movie would lose.
you can't be serious.
let's face it.
the kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher for Purim anymore.
Speedman is a dying star, a white dwarf heading for a black hole.
that's physics. It's inevitable.
we've been handed an incredible opportunity here, Peck.
the universe is talking to us right now.
you just gotta listen.
see, this is the good part, Pecker. This is when the job gets fun.
Yeah.
ask and you shall receive.
all right. - You play ball, we play ball.
I know you want the goodies.
welcome to the goody room.
you paying attention? 'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.
that's how you're gonna roll.
no more frequent flier bitch miles for my boy.
Yeah!
playa.
playa!
big dick playa.
swinging past your knees!
big dick, baby.
Yep.
or you can grow a conscience in the next five minutes and see where that takes you.
let me get this straight.
you want me to let my client of 15 years, one of my best friends, die in the jungle, alone, for some money and a G5?
Yes.
a G5 airplane?
Yes.
and lots of money.
playa.
Yeah!
smack it up, flip it, rub it down!
but Mama take care of Jack a lot.
how many more sleeps before she wakes up again?
sorry, Jack.
she in heaven now.
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.
she sleep forever.
to the man's credit, he's actually eased up on the retard throttle.
and now that's added a balance, and the audience can connect.
I mean, this is Theater 101, but, you know, he's had a tough road.
he'll become a naturalist.
Yeah. - Break down the aesthetic distance, then the...
told you I'd tag you back.
can I tell you that I'm sorry for any offense I might've caused, man?
I just got caught up in... - In being a dumbass?
I guess so.
why you still doing this Chicken George shit, I have no idea.
neither do I. - It's beyond me.
it's beyond me. - You confused.
I am a little confused. - I know.
but are we cool?
not really.
Hey, man.
how's it going? - Good. Yourself?
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,
I think I'm just gonna hang back here for the mission.
watch the stuff.
is that cool? - What? No!
we need you, Jeff.
what are you talking about?
okay, look, man.
I got something to tell you. - Okay.
you know those jellybeans I was eating?
well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?
they were drugs. - Really?
I get down there near the mother Lode, I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.
I'm gonna fucking do all the hero in in the fucking world.
if you guys wanna make it through this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.
are you serious? - Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.
and you can, no matter what, you can't fucking untie me until it is done, until it is out of my system.
I'm gonna say, "Hey, man, I'm cool." It's cool.
I'm finally better. I'm finally better. Untie me.
don't listen to me! Anything I fucking say is a lie!
you got it!
goodbye, Mama!
now you can have ice cream in heaven.
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed, in my head movies.
but this head movie makes my eyes rain.
dang. Gilligan catching a kidney shot.
they got him on the move! - That's torture, man.
okay. That's where they keeping him.
I gotta get cracking on my costume.
say, are you good with a needle and thread?
hell, yeah.
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than five million pairs last spring at the Gap.
I sewed them patterns myself, baby. - Let's roll out.
it's a little twig man Oscar.
I'm going to call you Half Squat.
and you can call me
Papa.
wow, look at all those stars.
really makes a guy feel pretty small.
this could be the last time we look at these stars.
man, that's beauty.
nights like tonight make a man wonder what it's all about.
Hey, you guys. Anybody got some bug spray?
don't ignore me!
stick it out, man. We're gonna get through this.
Hey, Kirk? - Yeah?
are you still dating Jennifer Love Hewitt?
cause I think she's hot.
no, that was just some tabloid conjecture.
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through. You can untie me now.
funny, huh?
the circus life 280 days a year on location.
it's hard to find a girl that can hang with that, you know?
not one worth keeping, no how.
Hey, Radar? Evans?
no, it's Kevin.
Kev, whatever the fuck. Come over here.
I didn't tell you, but Fatties: Fart Three is coming down the pike, and there's a role in there for you if you come over and untie me.
Jeff, you're just going to have to tough it out.
your mother's a cankerous whore!
Jesus, man.
Hey, man.
remember way back when I said your mother was a cankerous whore?
I'm sorry, man. I did not mean that. She's not.
how about you, man?
you got some little minx waiting for you on the other side of tomorrow?
me?
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and...
I was really hoping I'd get laid when this movie came out, but that's not gonna happen.
what about you, Masterblaster?
you got a certain someone you trying to get with back in the States?
what, Alpa Chino? He's like 10 girls deep.
no. You missing me, man.
I'm talking about something special. Big difference.
how about it?
Yeah.
Yeah, there is.
well? What's the skinny? Y'all been on a date or what?
no. I mean...
I always wanted to, but I guess I just never had the courage to ask.
it's... It's complicated.
No! It's simple as pie, man.
you plant your feet in the ground, you look her square in the eyes, you say, "Hey, baby, you and me's going on a date." That's the end of story.
what's her name? - Lance.
listen here, Lance...
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear? Lance?
did you say "Lance"? - No!
that sounded like "Lance." - No, I said "Nance."
that's what I said, "Nance." - It sounded like "Lance."
look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?
I love the pussy! All right?
lay your ass back down and look at the stars.
when you wrote I Love Tha Pussy was you thinking of dangling your dice on Lance's forehead?
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.
man, everyone's gay once in a while. - I'm not gay!
this Hollywood.
how about we all get back to work?
okay. Cool. - This is ridiculous!
we got a big day tomorrow. Let's get focused.
Alpa, if you untie me, I will literally suck your dick right now.
I told you, for the last time, I love the pussy!
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft, work the pipe and swallow the gravy.
get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.
okay, so, what's the plan?
are you gonna talk Vietnamese to those dudes?
no. No. Mandarin Chinese.

I couldn't have done it without you, Slolom.
Really?
no, dickhead, of course I could.
a nutless monkey could do your job. - Well, I...
now, go get drunk and take credit at all the parties.
I would never do that to... - Joking.
yeah? - Yeah.
very... Okay, there he is.
there he is. Okay. - Go have fun.

she's the most successful president in the history of our network and for the past five years has kept us at the very top of the ratings.
she's our maverick, our wild card, and today she's gonna take us right to the edge.
please welcome a giant, a genius and the hardest-working person in television: Joanna Eberhart.
way to go, Joanna!
thank you all so much. Thank you.
Joanna!
that feels good, especially coming from such a fantastic group of people from all across our great nation, our network affiliates.
give yourselves a great big hand. You deserve it.
and I want a big, fat Christmas bonus.
just kidding, but not really, because...
...I am so excited, I am so on fire, I am so guts-and-glory passionate about what I am about to show you.
so get ready, because on Monday nights the whole world will be watching a man, a woman and a buzzer!
are you ready for the final gender challenge?
who makes more money? - - I do.
who enters lronman triathlons every year and wins?
I do.
who secretly wishes they were married to a hot, sexy lesbian?
I do! - - I do!
it's Tara!
and...
...on Thursdays...
no, this is not just a TV show.
no, this is a breakthrough, a breakout, a break-all-the-rules and bring-on-the-Emmys mega-smash!
Yes!
can I present to you this planet's ultimate reality phenomenon?
I Can Do Better?
we will all be right there as happily-married couples are flown first class to a tropical island paradise where they will be completely surrounded by professional prostitutes.
and at the end of the week... Well, let's take a peek.
well, it's been a week, and Hank, our personnel manager from Omaha, has spent the entire seven days with Vanessa, our call girl and exotic dancer.
Yeah, it's been amazing.
and I'll admit we've had some fun in the hot tub and all.
but you wanna know something, Billy?
all we did was talk...
...because I love my wife...
...and the only place I want to be is back in Omaha with my Barbara.
tough break, Nessa.
and Barbara, you spent Monday with Rocky, our bodybuilder and male escort,
tuesday through Thursday with the entire cast of the XXX film Hung Jury, and you spent the entire weekend with Tonkiro.
and now it's time for the final decision. Barbara, it's yours to make.
is it gonna be Omaha?
or "Oma-hunks"?
well...
...before I came on this show I only had sex with one man, and that was usually Hank.
I love Hank deeply and forever with all my heart, and I would never do anything to hurt him.
but I can do better!
the battle of the sexes, as old as time but as
Why?
excuse me? - Why did you do it?
Oh, my God, it's Hank from I Can Do Better?
Hank, everyone.
no, stop it.
I love Barbara. I had a family. I had a life.
Hank,
I know it hurts.
love isn't easy.
relationships aren't easy, not for anyone.
but now you know the truth about Barbara, and you are gonna move on with your life.
and you're gonna meet someone wonderful, and America is gonna love you.
Yeah. I've got a great idea for another hot new show.
well, tell it to us.
it's called...
...let's Kill All the Women. - He's got a gun!
Joanna, are you all right? - I am great.
raring to go. The police were sensational. And not a scratch.
you haven't heard? - About what?
that man, Hank. Right before he tried to kill you, he went to see his ex-wife and five of her new boyfriends.
he did? - He shot all of them.
the wife is in critical condition, and four of the guys are on life support.
Tonkiro? - He's fine.
thank God. - So you know what this means.
of course.
we pay for all of their medical treatment, every penny.
we get them the very best therapist, childcare, rehab, whatever they need, and then we fly them to New York, first class, for a prime-time special,
Hank and Barbara: Let the Healing Begin.
you're not listening.
we can't wear this. The lawsuits alone may bankrupt the network.
and all your new shows, the whole lineup, the affiliates won't touch them.
we have shareholders.
we can't let you sink the network.
but we wish you only the best.
of course.
thank you for being so classy and taking this so well.
Joanna, we just wanted to say that this is so not fair.
goodbye, everybody!
all the best!
Jo?
Walter.
what happened? - Well, you've had a complete nervous collapse.
and the doctors say there's a lot of work to do, but you're gonna be just fine.
Oh, and Pete made this for you.
Oh, that's so sweet. - lsn't it?
and I wanted you to know that the minute I heard the news,
I called the network and I quit.
you did that for me? - Of course.
I know I was only a vice president, but I could never work for those people, not after the way they treated you.
Oh, Walter...
and do you remember what today is?
it's our anniversary.
Oh, Walter...
...I'm so sorry.
maybe that man who tried to shoot me, maybe he was right.
maybe I've become the wrong kind of woman.
maybe I've made all of the wrong decisions.
could we get away and start over?
and get it right, our marriage?
but why are we moving? - To Connecticut?
we're moving so that we can all kick back and have a great new life in this beautiful new town.
name? - Kresby.
welcome to Stepford. - Thanks.
what do you think, guys? - Cool.
good. - Honey?
Hello, everyone. I'm Mrs. Wellington.
welcome to Stepford.
I'm with Stepford Realty. We spoke on the phone.
you must be Walter. - So nice to meet you in person.
and the little ones.
I bet you're Pete.
Duh. - Pete.
and he's every bit as handsome as his dad.
thank you.
and Kimberly, aren't you just the cutest little bug's ear.
bugs don't have ears.
isn't she sassy, and a little sad.
and this must be Joanna.
electroshock? - But she's doing great.
Hello, little Energizer.
the minute Walter called, I knew this was the perfect house for you.
it's the top of the line here at Stepford Estates, and it's got everything an American family could ever need.
and may I present to you... - Look at this.
this is amazing. -...the great room.
I call it cozy.
and it's also a smart house. Now, this controls the security system.
all secure. - It talks to the refrigerator.
we need juice, we need juice, we need juice.
the system also monitors all the commodes.
where it will test your urine for blood sugar, protein and body fat.
flush toilets.
isn't that great, kids?
I'm gonna go check my room. - Me too.
now, Walter, will you be commuting?
no.
no, Joanna and I both left the network.
Oh, look, it's the puppy.
robo Rover 3000. Come on, boy. Come on, come on, come on.
Joanna.
the town is over 200 years old.
it was founded by George Washington, and Martha just loved it.
Stepford is Connecticut's family paradise.
it has no crime, no poverty and no pushing.
what is that? Up on the hill?
well, that's our Stepford Men's Association.
where all our wonderful guys can get together and stay out of our hair.
am I right?
where do the women go? - To the Simply Stepford Day Spa.
good morning, ladies. - Good morning, Claire.
I would like you all to welcome our newest citizen to Stepford: Joanna.
good morning, Joanna.
are we ready to work out? - Oh, yes.
places and poles, please.
wait, you work out dressed like this?
well, of course. Whatever we do, we always want to look our very best.
I mean, why, imagine if our husbands saw us in worn, dark, urban sweat clothes with stringy hair and almost no makeup?
Oh, good heavens.
now, today you are in for a special treat because we are working on a series of exercises which I've personally invented, based on simple household tasks.
I call my program Clairobics.
because her name is Claire.
all right, now it's time to slim and scrub.
let's all be washing machines. And...
and...
come on, Joanna.
spin cycle, ladies, and...
and...
and...
and...
sweet. - Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Who's the man?
you the man.
thank you, dear.
Walter?
Hey, how you doing? - Walter Kresby.
good to see you. - Ted Van Sant.
I'm Stan Peters. Come on in, come on in.
Mike said you were coming. - Nice to see you.
come on in.
hear ye, hear ye. Come one, come all, and happy Fourth of July.
at 1: 30 will be the children's Stars and Stripes, face painting...
isn't this great?
a real old-fashioned town picnic. Can't get this in Manhattan.
which is why we're gonna stay exactly ten minutes.
we're gonna make an appearance, and then we're gonna get out of here.
kids, I'm really sorry about all of this, but let's try and have fun.
mom, it's a picnic.
chill. - Go ahead, go ahead, have fun.
ten minutes?
Walter, you just don't get it.
these women are like deranged-flight-attendant friendly.
they're gonna be all over me. - Joanna!
here we go.
Oh, Joanna. - Joanna, hi.
Hi, Walter. - Hi.
you look great. - I love you in khakis.
they're new, a little experiment.
now I know why they call it Banana Republic.
excuse me. Excuse me!
excuse me, ladies. Excuse me.
excuse me. Excuse me.
excuse me.
am I the only one who finds all of this more than a little disturbing?
we are celebrating our nation's birthday, but there are almost no African-Americans, no Native Americans, no Asian Americans, and... Oh, my God.
Hey, you're Joanna Eberhart. You got such a raw deal.
aren't you Bobbie Markowitz?
I love your books, especially the last one. What was it called?
it was about your relationship with your mother.
I Love You But Please Die. - Hey, baby. Baby.
look what I did, look.
happy Fourth of July, everybody.
excuse me. Is this guy bothering you?
Yes, he's my husband. - Hey Kresbo-Man.
Hey, Dave. - How do you know each other?
men's Association. - That place.
did you finish the laundry? - No, I finished a chapter.
did you make the sandwiches? - Did you?
where are the kids? - What kids?
our kids.
Hey, are you two OK? - We're fine.
come on, I need a cookie. - See what I mean?
Jerry... Jerry, it's a bake sale, an actual bake sale.
it's like some heavenly diorama at the Smithsonian in the Hall of Homemakers.
Oh, no. No, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
that is not cobbler.
Roger, could we...? Could we reel it in, like, a couple of hundred yards?
how do you ladies keep your figures?
is there just a huge vat of cobbler vomit somewhere?
but worth it? - Roger.
Oh, I'm sorry.
that is... - This is fabulous.
Jerry thinks that I overdo, you know, everything.
excuse me, aren't you Roger Bannister?
the amazing architect from The Times?
Oh, thank you. This is Jerry Harmon.
Hi. - Corporate attorney.
but he's getting the help that he needs.
stop it. - You stop it.
we're new. - Oh, my God, Joanna Eberhart.
I love the shows. - Oh, thank you.
and Bobbie Markowitz. Love the books.
Jerry, how did this happen? Where did you come from?
I mean, right here in Stepford.
people.
attention, attention, Fourth of July funsters, grab your partners because it's time for some sizzling Stepford square dancing, so come on in.
square dancing? - Cowgirls?
we're in hell. - Come on, Bobbie.
Howdy. - Howdy.
OK, everybody ready to kick up your heels for some barn-busting Stepford high-stepping?
OK.
bow to your partners Lose your cares - There you go. - Stepford stallions love their mares
all men left, all men right
rope that filly, she won't bite
all join hands and circle sweet
please your cowboy with your feet - Nice shirt, Stan. - Thanks.
yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay, - yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay, - Honey.
yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay. - Calm down.
do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do, - Whoa, back up, guy. - do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do...
Jesus.
do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do.
excuse me. Excuse me. - Is she all right?
it's OK. - Excuse me.
do-si-do. - All right. OK. Don't try to move her.
she's drunk. - There's no need, thank you.
she's blond. - I'm her husband.
do-si-do. - Jo, you're not a doctor.
somebody call 91 1. - Mike's here.
Mike.
Mike. - Do-si-do.
do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do.
Mike. - It's OK. I'm here.
Walter, the missus.
the missus? - Jo, Jo.
Walter, what is your problem?
excuse me. - Stand back, please.
Hey! Excuse... - Excuse me.
what was that? - Herb, Dave, give me a hand, and we'll get Sarah right into my Hummer.
your Hummer? - It's a sweet ride.
it's roomy. - Here you go.
we need an ambulance. You shouldn't be moving her.
she might need oxygen, paramedics.
everything isn't always about you, Jo.
Walter.
she'll be fine. It's too much sun. She's dehydrated.
dehydrated? Are you crazy? - Jo. I'm sorry about this, Mike.
Joanna. Joanna, this is a very special moment.
I would like you to meet... - Mike Wellington.
my husband.
Oh... - And you must be the famous Joanna.
you're even prettier than in the newspapers.
they don't do you justice. - Excuse me, that woman is very sick.
thank you. I should be going with her.
she'll get all the help she needs. Trust me, little lady.
that woman had a seizure, and she was practically levitating.
and I have told you five million times I phoned Herb.
he said that Sarah is fine.
she just needed some fluids, just like Mike said.
she was sparking, Walter. - She was dancing.
then why wasn't there a doctor anywhere? And why...?
Why...?
Walter! Walter! And why did everyone just automatically listen to that Mike person?
and why, why was everyone just standing there?
you mean why weren't they just listening to you?
that's not what I'm saying! - Jesus Christ, Joanna!
what? - You were fired, your kids barely know you, and our marriage is falling apart.
and your whole attitude makes people want to kill you.
it makes people try to kill you.
that's what we're doing here.
the people in this town have been nothing but friendly and welcoming and wonderful to you.
and you've been nothing but snide and suspicious.
and on top of that, at the picnic you humiliated me.
well, I can't do it anymore.
I can't keep fighting you for every inch of everything. Game over.
marriage over. - Oh, no!
No! - No what?
please don't go.
why not? - Because you're right.
wait, I'm sorry. I don't think I heard that. What did you just say?
I said, you're right.
about?
about everything.
about me.
do you know why I signed on at the network?
because I thought that if I was around, I could help you lighten up.
you did?
Yeah, I did. What was that one show called?
I Can Do Everybody?
see, that's what I mean. I wanted to make you laugh.
that's so sweet, but l...
I was busy. I was running a network, Walter.
you were so busy that we haven't made love in over a year.
I know. I... - Well, I miss you.
but I've always loved you so much. I...
you know that.
Why?
because... Because...
...you're goofy, and you're...
you're handsome, and you're... You're...
you're my Walter.
and because when you play computer chess you do that little...
you do that little victory dance. - I do not. I don't do that.
Yes, you do. - No, I don't.
but if I'm not the smartest and the best of the best and the most successful, then I don't know, who am l?
you wanna find out?
how?
first of all, we're in the country now, so no more black.
no more black? Are you insane? - You heard me.
only high-powered, neurotic, castrating,
Manhattan career bitches wear black. Is that what you wanna be?
ever since I was a little girl.
do I really look OK?
can I be honest?
you look kind of like Betty Crocker. - I know.
at Betty Ford. - We need milk.
we need milk. We need milk. - Thank you.
look, I'm trying to make an effort to change.
I mean, last night my husband was a different person.
he was strong, he was forceful, he was commanding.
like your refrigerator.
well, nobody said it was gonna be easy being a homemaker and a stay-at-home mom.
it's the toughest job in the world, right?
well, that may be, but these Stepford women, - they're a whole other dimension. - Oh, like yesterday, that poor lady, Sarah Sunderson.
Walter said she's fine.
but you said she was shooting off sparks from her ears.
now, that's the first sign. - Of what?
cheap jewelry.
we should go see her. - Why?
because we need to be supportive.
that's how people behave outside of Manhattan.
they care about each other.
I mean, if you were in New York and one of your neighbors got sick - what would you do? - We'd call her.
to see if she was gonna die. - So we could get the apartment.
let's go. Up. Up. Up.
Sarah?
yoo-hoo. - Yoo-hoo? Is she in there?
what are you doing? - It's open.
that's amazing. - So sweet.
and so trusting.
Roger.
Roger.
look at this place. - Wow.
Sarah? - Sarah?
Roger.
Oh, Herb.
Oh, baby. - Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
make me beg! - Yeah!
Oh, I'm so lucky!
Oh, my God. - Is that a DVD?
no, it's them.
Oh, you're the king!
Yes!
I'm going up there. - Why?
Roger! - I want some.
Roger. - Roger.
baby, grab me some nachos. - Yes, dear.
what's this?
Roger, put it down. - What? Oh, come on.
Roger. - Why does it say Sarah?
Roger, you should put it down now.
let's get out of here. - This isn't our house.
Oh, stop. Would you just quit?
we have to, Roger. - For God's sake, we're trespassing.
we have to get out of here.
put it down. Come on. - OK, let's try and use this.
we have to go.
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm mortified. I'm famished.
Bobbie. - Yeah?
are you making anthrax? - Excuse me.
I've been busy. My new book.
but can't you hire someone to clean?
someone brave?
Dave says I got to do it myself, like Sarah Sunderson.
Oh, could you believe her? - But, darling, her home is spotless.
and she's having incredible sex in the middle of the day with her husband.
well, I'm sorry, but my shrink says I need creative chaos.
my therapist says I need boundaries. - My doctor said I need enough electricity to jumpstart Vegas.
you ever done Zoloft? - Kid stuff.
xanax. I worship Xanax. I'm old-fashioned.
I like Prozac with a Viagra chaser.
you're up, and you're up.
Oh, Roger. - Viagra.
Hey, is there something that you need to tell us?
well... Sharing.
OK. OK.
Jerry and I have been in couple's counseling...
...for over a year...
...and finally... Finally, I just couldn't take it anymore.
I howled, "You've become a gay Republican.
and he said, "What's wrong with that?
I said, "What's wrong with that?
that's like wanting to be gay with a bad haircut.
exactly.
so the counselor suggested that we move to the 'burbs.
to find a balance. - We moved here as a last resort.
court order. Don't ask.
OK. I know this is unthinkable, but what if we could actually learn how to be happy...
...without Paxil or compulsive overeating?
what if we actually gave this whole thing a try for real, the whole Stepford thing?
Hey, yeah! - Only one can survive.
Zeus? Zeus? Zeus? Zeus?
Zeus? Zeus? Zeus? Zeus?
Zeus? Zeus? Zeus? Zeus? Zeus? - Come on, Kresbo baby.
Zeus? Zeus? - Rip her bra off!
Zeus? Zeus? Zeus?
Yeah!
Yeah! - Zeus rules the universe!
and Ted owes Walter 20 big ones!
Ah, to be a man.
so, Walt, you and Stepford, it seems like a real match.
I'll say. I mean, the town and the houses. This place.
well, it's like a dream. It's like...
like the way life was meant to be.
and all of your wives. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. They're so... So...
sweet?
Sizzling?
super fine?
well...
we are all so thrilled to be here at the Stepford Book Club,
I can't tell you.
now, I have just finished the third volume of Robert Caro's Life of Lyndon Johnson, and I am dying for the next installment.
well...
that's all marvelous, but today we are going to discuss...
well, it is probably the most important book any of us will ever read.
Yes, it is provocative, but it is also inspiring.
the Heritage Hills Special Edition Golden Deluxe Treasury of Christmas Keepsakes and Collectibles.
this book said to me, "Let's celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ with yarn.
now, Bobbie, we all realize you're probably feeling a bit uncomfortable with this week's book because you're...
Oh, what's the word I'm looking for? - New?
scared? - Cranky?
Jewish. - Same thing.
but the Heritage Hill series is very inclusive.
in fact, there is a whole chapter about Hanukkah.
I just love the chapter on pinecones.
they're not just for wreaths and centerpieces.
you can use pinecones to create a very special Yuletide menorah.
your pinecone snowman could be Jewish.
just add one of those little beanies.
or maybe I could just use hundreds of pinecones to spell out the words "Big Jew
in letters 15 feet tall in the snow in my front yard.
that's a wonderful idea.
Oh, yes, yes. - That's very wonderful.
Yes. - She's so smart.
I love the idea of creating a life-sized Santa Claus, - all out of pinecones. - OK, I love that.
I'm going to use a pinecone in my nativity as the baby Jesus.
and I'm going to attach a pinecone to my vibrator and have a really merry Christmas.
here comes Santa Claus Here comes Santa Claus
right down Santa Claus Lane
he's got a bag that's filled with toys For the boys and girls again
hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle What a beautiful sight
so jump in bed, cover up your head Because Santa Claus comes tonight - Who? - Santa Claus comes tonight
Joanna, how is she fitting in?
well...
OK...
I'm among friends, right?
of course. - Yeah.
so...
Joanna and I had this big talk, and we were really open with each other.
I mean, we really got it all out.
and I think from now on...
...She's gonna be very, very different.
you think Joanna's really going to change?
Yes, I do. Absolutely.
and how long have you been married?
Ted! - Yes.
don't you owe Walter $20?
that's absolutely right, I do.
babe!
Yes, darling?
Walt, sit down.
I need 20.
you know my PlN. - Of course.
she gives singles.
are these all for day camp tomorrow?
I just want you to be proud of me, honey.
dad, watch this.
ball.
aren't robots cool? - Oh, yeah.
may I speak to the man of the house?
Snot-butt. - Funkmaster Markowitz.
stone-cold Thriller Killer Kresbo. - Cupcakes, anyone?
cupcakes! - Cupcakes.
Hey, right on time.
Jo, these are smoking.
why don't you make stuff like this? - Why don't you?
because I have a penis.
we should get moving. - Yeah, we got a meeting.
at the Men's Association. - When will you be home, honey?
when I'm home.
call a sitter.
Bobbie, are you sure about this?
we're not spying. We're just visiting.
fellas, I can't tell you how happy we are to welcome all of this new blood.
you said it, Mike. - That's right.
I love, love this space.
it's very Ralph Lauren meets Sherlock Holmes.
it says, "l have taste and a scrotum.
Roger, you promised. - What?
whore. - Bore.
sorry. - No, no, no.
Jerry, you're gonna find that Stepford is very open-minded.
Oh, yeah. - We welcome you and your partner, just like any other couple.
Absolutely. Any other.
that's right. - Girlfriend.
miss... Miss Thing.
to Stepford! - Stepford!
you bet.
Yeah.
damn. Come on, let's go.
you think this is all right, sneaking around?
add it up.
all the women around here are perfect sex-kitten bimbos.
all the men are drooling nerds.
doesn't that seem strange? - Not to me.
why not? - I work in television.
Oh, come on.
you know, Walter, I think Joanna is right.
I think Stepford is the answer. - She's a great gal.
or she will be.
come on, help me up. - We shouldn't be here.
Oh, come on. Don't be such a chicken.
I should be home with my cupcakes. - Why?
because you only made 5, 000 of them?
we're trespassing. - Only if we get caught.
damn, I can't see a thing.
Oh, there's the light. There it is.
no, Bobbie.
this is like some alien freak show.
Why? They're just family portraits.
Yeah, that's what I said.
the lights.
we should get out of here.
should we run?
Oh, my God.
Clarice?
Hi, girls! - Roger!
you scared us.
what are you doing in here? - What's going on?
do they have hookers or old Playboys or cable porn?
Oh, please. They barely have throw pillows.
they're coming. - The menfolk.
call us. - OK.
Rog?
what was it? Did you see anyone?
not a soul.
but what's back here anyway, in all of these rooms?
storage? Sweaters?
bodies?
Jerry. - Do you see that door on your left?
check it out.
Oh, boy.
why, I can't see anything. It's dark.
use your flashlight.
I feel like Nancy Drew in The Mystery of the Mid-life Crisis.
what am I looking for?
look down.
Jerry?
Roger!
Roger!
Bobbie. - Roger!
Bobbie? - Roger!
Roger said there was nothing going on at the Men's Association.
well, then why doesn't he answer the phone?
it's been two days. - Bobbie.
Roger!
Roger!
isn't that his favorite shirt, the Dolce & Gabbana?
the Guccis.
and the Versace. - Maybe he's donating them.
to what? The gay homeless?
he loved this.
his program from Hairspray.
Oh, my God. - What is it?
Viggo.
thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Jerry Harmon, and l...
I know I'm pretty new here, but already I feel so at home.
why did Jerry ask us to meet him here?
proud that I can introduce Stepford's brand-new candidate for state senate.
ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mr. Roger Bannister.
what?
he's wonderful.
thank you.
thank you so much.
you may very well ask, what are my qualifications for higher office?
well, I believe in Stepford, America and the power of prayer.
values I've discovered thanks to my partner, in life and in the Lord, Jerry Harmon.
Roger. Roger.
Yes. Is there a question? Mrs. Markowitz?
so you two are happy now?
more than ever. Because now I know that being gay doesn't mean a guy has to be effeminate or flamboyant or sensitive.
I'm no sissy. - No.
way to go, Roger! - That's a man!
Roger? - Yes. Mrs. Walter Kresby.
Roger, I don't understand. You were out there, you were Roger.
and now...
now you're different. Your hair, your clothes.
you're like someone else. - People change.
you can't stop Stepford.
you can't stop Stepford. You can't stop Stepford.
you can't stop Stepford. You can't stop Stepford.
you can't stop Stepford. You can't stop Stepford.
you can't stop Stepford. You can't stop Stepford.
you can't stop Stepford. You can't stop Stepford.
you can't stop Stepford. You can't stop Stepford.
you can't stop Stepford. You can't stop Stepford.
you can't stop Stepford. You can't stop Stepford.
you can't stop Stepford. You can't stop Stepford.
so that's why we have to leave Stepford?
I'm not following. - OK.
before, Roger was witty and stylish and ironic.
and I'm sure he still is. - No.
now he's making speeches in a Brooks Brothers suit.
Hey, there's lots of ways to be gay.
don't try to make him into a stereotype.
Bobbie is right, and she's leaving too.
this place does something to people.
all of the women are always busy and perfect and smiling, and all of the men are always happy.
and that's a problem because...? - Because it's not normal, Walter.
it's... It's not the world. It's not us.
and I'm picking up our kids from camp right now, and we're getting out of here.
with or without you.
secure.
you'll never change, will you?
not really.
open the door.
unlock front.
and you're right.
about what?
if you're that unhappy, then we should move.
maybe head back to the city.
we could leave tomorrow.
thank you.
thank you.
what do you got there? Huh?
Sweetcakes?
it's 4 a. m. What are you up to?
just recipes for tomorrow. I like to get a head start.
on what? - Apple pie. Bobbie recommended it.
I'll be right up.
Walter?
babe?
Bobbie? Bobbie!
Oh, my God.
Bobbie?
good morning, Joanna.
isn't it a lovely morning?
that's a pretty color.
mom! - Mom!
good morning, my precious ones.
and thank you for leaving your requests on my e-mail.
Adam, you wanted peanut butter and jelly, no crusts, a Snickers bar and a Rolex.
Ben, here's a whole-wheat burrito, a soy protein shake and three pieces of German chocolate layer cake.
from scratch? - Of course.
and, Max, you get bacon, lettuce and tomato on a lightly-toasted sesame seed bagel.
but what about my action figures?
there's Mace Windu and Amidala.
Where's Boba Fett? - They were out.
mom! - Here's $500.
all right.
Bye, Mom. Bye, Joanna.
Oh, they grow up so fast. I think I'll have three more.
Bobbie, listen to me. What have they done to you, huh?
what have they done to you? Is it drugs?
is it brainwashing? Come on, hey, talk to me.
of course, but only for a minute. Then I have to get to work on this pigsty. Coffee?
no, no coffee. Bobbie, Bobbie.
last night I went online, all right? And I found out, all of the women here, they used to be big deals,
I mean, big deals.
ceos, executives, judges.
Sarah Sunderson, she used to run an airline.
with that perfect skin.
no. No, no, no. She didn't used to look like that.
none of the women did. They... - Coffee?
coffee? No. No coffee.
Bobbie. Bobbie. This isn't you.
that's right, Joanna. This isn't me.
it's a whole new me.
I'm happy and I'm healthy because I understand - what's important in life. - Yes.
your new book. - That's right.
that's what's important, my new cookbook.
and my husband and my family and making a perfect home.
it's a lesson every gal needs to learn.
especially you.
I'm your friend, Joanna. I'm going to help you.
you need me. - You stay away from me.
you're driven.
well, sometimes. - And you're selfish.
you wanna rule the world. - No.
I can fix you. I can change you.
What...have...they...done to you?
let's get busy.
answer the phone.
Hello, is...? Is this the day camp?
Oh.
Yes, this is... This is Joanna Eberhart. I would like to speak to my children.
I'm coming to pick them up right now.
what?
Walter!
Walter, where are you?
I know you've got the kids.
Pete, Kimberly!
Oh, boys.
welcome.
where are my children?
they're perfectly safe. - Where are my children?
you'll see them soon. - Where's Walter?
how could you do this?
ever since we met, you've beaten me at everything.
you're better educated.
you're stronger, you're faster.
you're a better dancer, a better tennis player.
you've always earned at least six figures more than I could ever dream of.
you're a better speaker, a better executive.
you're even better at sex. Don't deny it.
I wasn't going to.
well, don't I get anything?
you got me.
no, I got to hold your purse.
I got to tell the kids that you'd be late again.
I got to tell the press that you had no comment.
I got to work for you.
with me.
under you.
all of us.
we married wonder women.
Supergirls.
amazon queens. Well, you know what that makes us?
smart, worthy, lucky.
we're the wuss.
the wind beneath your wings.
your support system.
we're the girl. - And we don't like it.
no, we don't. - Yeah, that's right.
you're damn right. - Yeah. That's right.
and is this your answer, to kill us?
Oh, no. Nothing like that. We help you. We perfect you.
by turning us into robots?
does any fraction of these women still exist?
of course. Almost everything.
shall we show her? - Show me what?
it's a promotional thing I've been working on for when we go global.
Walter, I don't think you've seen this.
some guys ask, how do we do it?
in layman's terms, it's really pretty simple.
come on along.
first, we take a gloomy, dissatisfied woman.
then, in a very private experience between husband and wife, he gently places her in our female improvement system.
it's fully automated.
and then, abracadabra.
her transformation begins.
first, we locate her brain.
we insert a few nanochips.
then we program them.
also, we add some secret, special ingredients.
to avoid any accidents, her husband is kept at a comfortable distance.
safety first.
finally, we enhance her, to fit the ideal Stepford Wife specifications.
and...
... voila?
everything is copasetic.
welcome to the future.
it's a painting again.
I should explain. You see, my real name isn't Mike.
it's just a nickname from where I used to work.
where? - Microsoft.
NASA. - Disney.
aol.
is that why the women are so slow?
Joanna.
is this what you really want?
women who behave like slaves, women who are obsessed with cleaning their kitchens and doing their hair, women who never challenge you in any way, women who exist only to wait on you hand and foot?
Yeah. - That sounds good to me.
Joanna, you're a brilliant woman.
surely you can appreciate, at the very least, the genius of the concept.
picture, if you could streamline your spouse, if you could overhaul every annoying habit, every physical flaw, every moment of whining and nagging and farting in bed.
imagine...
...if you could enjoy the person you loved, but only at their very best.
and the only reason for your anger, your resentment, your rage is really very simple.
you're furious because we thought of it first.
while you were trying to become men, we decided to become gods.
let me ask you something, these machines, these Stepford Wives, can they say, "l love you"?
Mike.
of course.
fifty-eight languages.
but do they mean it?
enjoy.
Walter.
Walt.
Joanna. Right here.
Sarah. - Claire.
Marianne. - Charmaine.
Roger. - Roberta.
Oh, Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike?
Mike, Mike, Mike? Mike, Mike, Mike?
good evening, everyone.
what a delight to see all of our wonderful wives and their happy, happy husbands.
tonight is truly the highlight of our year because tonight we honor our very newest citizens of Stepford.
in my opinion, they are the cream of the crop in couple that proudly proclaims Stepford the American way of love.
now...
...I'd like to ask my wonderful woman, my lovely wife, my bride, my best friend, to join me in a glorious midsummer night's waltz.
Yeah.
is everything perfect?
everything.
Mike. - Yeah.
darling.
my pleasure. - It's an honor.
champagne? - Allow me.
doors activate.
welcome member 1956.
Kresby, Walter.
entering secure area.
warning.
warning.
Initiating.
so, Joanna, are you enjoying Stepford?
Oh, yes. The town is so splendid.
everyone is so kind.
and then, of course, there's you.
me?
and it's simple really.
honey, grab me another Scotch.
right away, dear.
begin nanoreversal.
begin nanoreversal.
Nanoreversal completed.
deleting Stepford program.
file corrupted.
deleting vacuuming function.
honey.
Oh, Herbert.
restoring original personality. Deleting Stepford program.
what is this?
what am I wearing?
Mike!
Mike, there's something...
...unspeakable going on in the ballroom.
you have to come right now.
it's an apocalypse!
what did you do to us?
Mike! - Mike!
men, control your wives.
control your wives.
it's not working!
this is not Stepford.
Mike, what's happening?
I was in the garden, and I was dreaming of your...
your smile and your after-shave.
and I realized...
...I can do better.
Walt. - She's not a robot.
what? - What?
what, she's not a robot?
she never was.
wait a second.
I couldn't do it. - What?
why not?
because she's not a science project.
because I didn't marry something from RadioShack.
that's a shame.
no.
that's a man.
I thought you were ready.
I thought... I thought you were ready. I thought I knew you.
you're a disgrace.
to everything this town stands for.
to the future.
that's right, that's right. Tell him.
you're gonna have to pay for that.
don't you touch him.
No!
he's a Stepford Husband?
an angel.
now he's just...
...spare parts, thanks to you.
but what are you? Are you a person or a machine?
I'm a lady.
a real lady?
every inch. - Wait.
wait, a real, real lady? Are you a human being?
Yes, and I may very well be the only decent human being left.
in Stepford? - In the world!
she's fabulous.
all of this, Mike, the wives, Stepford, this was all your idea?
Yes. All I wanted was a better world.
a world where men were men and women were cherished and lovely.
does anyone have a screwdriver?
she's nuts.
a world of romance and beauty, of tuxedos and chiffon, a perfect world.
but you were married to a robot.
the perfect man.
and all I wanted was to make you, all of you...
...into perfect women.
we don't need to be perfect.
how could you do this to us?
because I was just like you.
overstressed, overbooked, under-loved.
I was the world's foremost brain surgeon and genetic engineer.
I had top-secret contracts with the Pentagon, Apple and Mattel.
I was driven.
exhausted.
until late one night, I came home to find...
...Mike.
with Patricia.
my brilliant...
...blond...
...21-year-old research assistant.
it was all so...
...ugly.
then early the next morning, as I gazed across the breakfast table at their lifeless bodies, I thought...
..."What have I done?
but more importantly...
...what I could do to make the world more beautiful?
I had the skills.
but I needed help to realize my larger vision.
and so I made...
...Mike.
because he was someone other men would listen to.
and then I asked myself, "Where would people never notice a town full of robots?
Connecticut.
so I decided to turn back the clock, to a time before overtime, before quality time, before women were turning themselves into robots.
back off! - Sorry.
why didn't you change the men too?
that's next.
you're insane.
I'm in love with a waltz and a town...
...and a man.
so, Joanna, you produced the hard-hitting documentary,
Stepford: The Secret of the Suburbs.
and won... Five Emmys, was it?
Oh, six.
she's shy. - And so humble.
and, Bobbie, your ordeal has lead to a bestseller.
you know, I just can't hold a grudge.
so I've written my very first book of poetry.
and it's all about hope and communication and the healing power of love.
what is it called?
wait Until He's Asleep, Then Cut It Off.
it's a page-turner. - I cried.
now, Roger, good news.
you ran and won. You're in the state senate.
lndependent. - Next stop, the White House.
Yes, this country needs highlights. - That's our hero.
and, Jo, Walter really came through for you, so how's your marriage now? Is everything just perfect?
no way.
but we're doing just great.
because, um...
because now, now we know for sure that it's not about perfection.
perfect. Perfect doesn't work.
what about all those other husbands?
are they still angry? Do they still want all these women to be robots?
of course. Men are pigs.
how you doing, Keaton?
I can't feel my legs...
ready?
what time is it?
it all started back in New York six weeks ago.
a truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of Queens.
the driver didn't see anyone, but someone fucked up.
he heard a voice. Sometimes that's all you need.
Mr. McManus? - Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?
we have a warrant for your arrest. - Fuck you, pig.
who wants to know? - New York Police Department.
shit. - Freeze!
hold it!
sure you brought enough guys?
it's quite simple:
a restaurant that changes with the taste without losing the overall aesthetic.
in other words...
...the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls.
let me give you an example-- - This I had to see for myself.
I'm in a meeting. - Time for another one.
everyone, this is David Kujan.
special Agent Kujan. US Customs.
these gentlemen are from the New York Police Department.
you look good. Better than I would have thought.
a small matter of a stolen truck loaded with guns.
Mr. Keaton?
will you excuse us for a moment?
we have some questions to ask you downtown. You'll be a while.
no. Please, sit down.
this is a small problem.
enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.
it didn't make sense that I'd be there.
these guys were hard-core hijackers...
...but there I was.
at that point, I wasn't scared.
I knew I hadn't done anything they could do me for.
besides, it was fun.
I got to make like I was notorious.
you all know the drill.
when your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given.
number 1, step forward.
hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker.
number 2, step forward.
gimme the fuckin' keys, you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!
knock it off. Get back. Number 3, step forward.
hand me the keys, you cocksucker. - In English, please.
excuse me? - In English.
hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker. What the fuck?
number 4, step forward.
it was bullshit. The whole rap was a setup.
hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker.
it was the cops' fault.
you don't put guys like that into a room together.
who knows what can happen?
hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker.
this has really got to be embarrassing for you guys.
they drilled us all night.
someone was mad about that truck hijacking and the cops had nothing.
they were hoping somebody would slip up and give them something.
they knew we wouldn't fight, they knew how to lean on us.
they've been doing it forever. Our rights went out the window.
it was a violation. Disgraceful.
they went after McManus first. Topnotch entry man.
what truck?
the truck with the guns, fucko. - "Fucko"?
he was a good guy. Crazy, though.
wanna know what your pal Fenster told us?
say who? - McManus.
he told us another story.
is that the one about the hooker with the dysentery?
Fenster always worked with McManus. He was a real tight-ass.
but when it came to the job, he was right on. A smart man.
what are you saying? - I said he'll flip you.
he'll what? - Flip you. Flip you for real.
I'm shaking. Come on. - Okay.
answer my questions. - Can you hear me in the back?
Hello?
I want my lawyer.
I'm gonna have your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.
Todd Hockney: good with explosives.
without a doubt, the one guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody.
you guys don't have a fuckin' leg to stand on.
you think so, tough guy?
I can put you in Queens during the hijacking.
Really?
I live in Queens.
did you put that together yourself, Einstein?
you got a team of monkeys working full time on this?
you know what happens if you do another turn in the joint?
I fuck your father in the shower, and have a snack.
are you gonna charge me, dickhead? - I'll charge you when I'm ready.
with what? - You know damn well, dead man.
Keaton was the real prize for them for obvious reasons.
it was your mistake, not mine.
did you ever stop to ask me?
I've been walking around with the same face, the same name.
I'm a businessman.
what's that? The restaurant business?
no. From now on you're in the "getting fucked by us" business.
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.
like I said...
...it was your mistake ...not mine.
you charge me with this shit...
...and I'll beat it.
okay?
let's get back to the truck, asshole.
really, somebody's got to do something about this shit.
they put me in holding every five minutes. So I did a little time.
does that mean I get railed every time a truck finds it's way gone?
fuck 'em.
Fenster, will you relax?
these guys don't have any probable cause. - You fuckin' right. No PC.
you're goddamn right. You do some time, never let you go.
they treat me like a criminal.
I'll end up a criminal. - You are a criminal.
why'd you got to go and do that?
I'm trying to make a point. - Why don't you make your point?
you're making me tired all over.
fuck it then.
I heard you were dead. - Yeah?
you heard right. - Word I got is you hung up your spurs.
what's that all about? - What's this?
rumor has it Keaton's gone straight. I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.
who's that?
she's a heavyweight criminal lawyer from uptown.
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.
how 'bout it, Keaton?
you a lawyer's wife?
what kind of retainer you giving her?
do your friend a favor...tell him to keep quiet.
Dean Keaton...
gone clean?
say it ain't so.
or was it you that hit that truck? - Mac, forget him.
did you get to talk to your lawyer?
this whole thing was a shakedown.
what makes you say that? - How many times you been in a lineup?
it's always you and four dummies.
the PD are paying homeless guys $10 a head half the time.
there's no way they'd line five felons in the same row.
what's a voice lineup? Public defender could get you out of that.
why the hell was I strip searched? - It was the feds.
a truckload of guns gets snagged.
customs comes down on NYPD for answers. They come up with us.
they're clutching at straws. - I had a guy's finger up my ass.
is it Friday already?
Yeah, lover boy.
you want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.
so who in the goddamn piss hell stole our fucking truck?
what did you say? - Who stole the fucking truck?
I don't want to know. - Who asked you, workingman?
fuck who did it. What I want to know is, who's the gimp?
he's okay. - Says you. How do I know that?
what about it, pretzel man? What's your story?
his name is Verbal.
verbal Kint.
verbal? - Yeah.
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.
I was going to tell you to shut up.
we met before, once or twice. - In County. I was in for fraud.
you were in a lineup then, too. What happened?
I walked. 90 days, suspended.
so you did it. - All right, now look...
...we've all been put out by this whole thing, right?
I figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity.
now, me and Fenster heard about a little job.
why don't you just calm down?
what do you care what he has to say?
I'm just talking here.
it seems to me like Mr. Hockney wants to hear it...
...and I know Fenster's down.
what about you, guy?
I'm interested.
there. See?
I'd like to exercise my right to free assembly.
why don't you just shut up?
you're missing the point.
no.
you're missing the point.
I don't want to hear anything from you.
I don't care about your job.
and...
...I want nothing to do with any of you.
I beg your pardon, but you can all go to hell.
Dean Keaton...
...gone the high road.
what is the world coming to?
fuck him.
and that was how it started:
five of us brought in on a trumped-up charge...
...to be leaned on by half-wits.
I really can't talk about it much here.
what the cops never figured out, and what I know now...
...was that these men would never break, never lie down.
never bend over for anybody.
anybody.
who are you? - Agent Jack Baer, FBI.
how many dead? - 15 so far.
they're still pulling bodies out of the water.
any survivors? - Two.
one guy's in County hospital, but he's in a coma.
the DA has a second guy, a cripple from New York.
the chief wants this place sealed off.
if you have any questions, give him a call.
this is Dave Kujan. I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.
if you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin of the San Pedro Police Department...
...at extension 112. Have a nice day.
why can't I see him? - I told you...
...the DA came down here last night ready to arraign...
...even before they moved him to County.
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...
...the DA comes out looking like the bogeyman smacked him around.
they take his statement, and they cut him a deal.
did they charge him with anything? - Weapons, misdemeanor.
what is that?
I give the DA credit for getting that much, you understand?
excuse me, sir.
this whole thing has turned political. The mayor was here last night.
the chief. This morning, the governor called, okay?
I'm telling you, this guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.
take my word for it. - When does he post bail?
maybe two hours, tops. - I want to see him.
no. - I gotta see him.
no. I can't-- - You gotta do this for me.
I came a long way for this.
Dave, please.
even if I let you talk to him, he won't talk to you.
he's paranoid about being recorded.
he knows the rooms are wired. - I quit.
this won't be an interrogation, just a friendly chat.
he won't go into the interrogation room. - Then someplace else.
where?
no, no.
if this was a dope deal, where's the dope? If it was a hit, who called it?
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories to answer all these questions.
you know what I think. - That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.
the guy's got total immunity. His story checks out.
he doesn't know what you want to know. - I don't think he does, not exactly.
but there's a lot more to his story, believe me.
I wanna know why 27 men died on that pier...
...for what looks to be $91 million worth of dope that wasn't there.
and above all, I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.
he's dead.
come on. Two hours. Just till he makes bail.
they're all dead.
I don't care how tough you say Keaton was...
...nobody on that boat could've come out alive.
is he talking? - He regained consciousness an hour ago.
he spoke, not English, then he lapsed.
Hungarian? - That might have been it.
most of them were Hungarians. - You gotta put this on.
burn victims are very susceptible to infection.
and, of course, there's no smoking.
keep your mask up. Please don't touch him.
is he gonna die?
he's burned 60 percent of his body, broken ribs
call security. Put a man on the door.
is he dangerous? - Yes.
do it.
do it now.
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.
look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.
Yes, I'm sure.
no, he's all fucked up.
I can't hear you.
will you shut up? I'm on the phone.
Yes.
no, not till I put a man on him.
send me someone who can speak Hungarian.
he's awake. He's talking like a Thai hooker.
what? - Keyser Soze!
no shit?
call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.
verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.
nice to meet you.
he wants to ask you a few questions before you go.
what about? - About a Dean Keaton, mostly.
I'd like to start at the lineup back in New York.
can I get some coffee? - In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.
I'm really thirsty. I used to dehydrate as a kid.
once I got so bad my piss come out like snot.
it was all thick and gooey-- - I'll get your fucking coffee.
get me one, too, while you're at it.
that guy is tense.
tension is a killer.
I used to be in a barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
the baritone was this guy named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.
like, orca fat. He was so stressed in the morning
you know we're trying to help you. - Sure, and I appreciate that.
and I wanna help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops.
I would've liked to have been a fed, but my CP
you're not tellin' us everything. I know you know something.
I told the DA everything I know.
I know you like Keaton.
I know you think he's a good man. - I know he was good.
he was a corrupt cop.
sure. 15 years ago, but he was a good thief.
the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.
are you trying to get a rise out of me?
I just wanna hear your story. - It's all there.
may I have a cigarette?
according to your statement-- - I need a light.
according to your statement, you're a short-con operator...
...run-of-the-mill
according to your statement, you're a short-con operator...
...run-of-the-mill scams.
it's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
I know. Sweet deal you have here. Total immunity.
I do have the weapons charge. I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.
you know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?
you know a religious guy named John Paul?
you know Ruby's in Attica? - He didn't have my lawyer.
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.
he's a good friend of mine, likes me very much.
I know your testimony is sealed. Ruby's well connected.
he's got lots of friends inside who do favors for him.
what would he say if he found out you dropped his name to the DA?
there's nothing there on Ruby. - I'll be sure to mention that to him.
know what I've learned on the job? How to spot a murderer.
say you arrest three guys for the same killing.
put them in jail overnight.
next morning, whoever's sleeping is your man.
if you're guilty, you know you're caught. You let your guard down.
you follow me? - No.
let me get to the point.
I'm smarter than you, and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.
I'm not a rat.
Thanks.
when I was pickin' beans in Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee.
right off the trees, I mean. That was good.
this is shit, but I'm in a police station. - Can we get started again?
what happened after the lineup?
the desk sergeant was telling me he couldn't release you.
can you believe that? You weren't even charged.
damn police.
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.
I'll take them to the DA tomorrow. - Forget about it.
I'll have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
I don't want to talk about it, okay?
what did Fortier and Renault say?
they asked for more time to think about investing.
damn it.
more time for what?
no matter how you cover my tracks they're still gonna find out about me.
give me some credit.
I got you this far. Let's go to the grand jury.
this isn't gonna stop if we don't-- - It's never going to stop, period.
by next week, every investor in the city is gonna be walking away from us.
it's finished.
I'm finished.
don't give up on me now.
it's never gonna stop.
I love you.
they ruined me in there tonight.
I love you.
do you hear me?
what?
all right.
let's just go to my place.
we'll worry about this tomorrow.
let's go.
Fenster and McManus had a cagey proposition:
a fast-jump, high-risk, long money.
we all knew it could be done.
the way I figured, to do it wrong meant killing.
to do it right took five men.
five men meant Keaton.
Keaton took convincing.
new York's finest taxi service.
bullshit.
bullshit.
they don't operate anymore.
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct. They're coming out for one job, Thursday.
they're pickin' up a guy smuggling emeralds from South America.
McManus already has a fence set up.
a fence? Who? - Some guy in California called Redfoot.
I never heard of him. - You have to come.
what's it to you whether I do it or not? - They don't know me. You do.
they won't take me unless you go.
look at me. I need this.
you're telling me you don't need this? Is this your place?
I'm not knocking you. You got a good scam going with this lawyer.
sorry.
it's okay.
you say it's the real thing? That's cool.
you okay?
I was out of line.
but they're never gonna stop with us. You know that.
as clean as you get, they'll never let you go now.
this way, we hit the cops where it hurts, and we get well in the meantime.
you sure you're okay?
I'll be all right.
look, I...
...sometimes get-- - Forget it.
I'll probably shit blood tonight.
so...
...how do they wanna do it?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I say no.
Fenster? Hockney?
they're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything.
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.
but like I say, they won't let me in without you.
$3 million?
maybe more.
no killing.
not if we do it my way.
new York's finest taxi service was not your normal taxi service.
it was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD that ran a high-profit racket...
...driving smugglers and drug dealers all over the city.
for $300 a mile, you got your own blue and white...
...and a police escort. They even had their own business cards.
after a while, somebody started asking questions, and the taxi service shut down.
ever since then, Internal Affairs has been waiting to catch them in the act.
that's where we came in.
so, how was the flight? - Fuckin' great.
will this get me to Staten Island?
are you kiddin' me? This will get you to Cape Cod.
McManus came to us with the job. Fenster got the vans.
hockney supplied the hardware.
I came through with how to do it so no one got killed.
but Keaton? Keaton put on the finishing touch.
a little "fuck you" from the five of us to the NYPD.
watch this.
careful.
come on, asshole!
holy shit!
don't move, you fucker! - Drop it now, motherfucker!
drop the fuckin' gun! Drop it!
don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.
what do you guys want? - Put your fuckin' thing away.
we're cops! Stupid assholes!
watch the glass! - Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!
you want a buckshot shampoo, chubby? - Shut up!
fuck.
afternoon, my little pork chops. Give me the shit.
don't move! - Give him the shit!
give him the fuckin' thing!
give him the fuckin' shit, man!
hurry up! Come on!
now the money! - There's no money.
give me the money now! - There's no fuckin' money.
give him the fuckin' money!
do it! Give him the money! - Give me the money!
give him the money! - Hurry up!
you know who the fuck I am?
you people know who the fuck I am? Fuck!
we do now, jerk-off.
cocksucker.
wait a minute. What's that?
what the fuck?
holy shit!
go!
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.
the press was on the scene before the police were.
Strausz and Rizzi were indicted three days later.
within a few weeks, 50 more cops went down with them.
everybody got it right in the ass, from the chief on down.
it was beautiful.
I owe you $2. 50.
Dr. Keaton.
there's more here than I thought. - When's the fence coming?
Redfoot never comes to see me. I always go to see him.
in California?
Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I
wait, hold the fuckin' phone. You and Fenster? No.
you fuckin' kiddin' me? - So then, who's gonna go?
we all go.
what's your fuckin' problem, man?
my problem, is you and Fenster honeymooning in California...
...while the rest of us are sittin' here holding our dicks.
the job's over.
cool it.
la's a good place to lay low for a while.
you wanna dance?
ladies.
I would like to propose a toast.
there you go.
to Mr. Verbal...
...the man with the plan.
we're gonna miss the flight.
don't do this. Send her a note. Something.
I said we'll make it.
we're gonna miss the plane.
she'll understand.
that's heartwarming. Really.
I'm weepy.
you wanna wait outside?
you guys wanted to know what happened. I'm telling you.
come on, Verbal.
who do you think you're talkin' to? You expect me to believe that he retired?
for a woman?
bullshit. Keaton was using her.
he loved her. - Sure.
I'm supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea.
it was all Fenster and McManus. - Keaton was a cop for four years.
who else would know better?
that job had his name on it. - Edie had him turned around.
let me tell you something.
I know Dean Keaton.
I've been investigating him for the past three years.
the guy I know was a cold-blooded bastard.
iad indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force.
don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold.
you got him all wrong.
do I?
Dean Keaton was under indictment seven times while he was on the force.
in every case, witnesses either reversed their testimony...
...or died before they could testify.
when they finally did nail him for fraud, he spent five years in Sing Sing.
he killed three prisoners inside.
of course, I can't prove this...
...but I can't prove the best part either.
Dean Keaton was dead.
did you know that?
he died in a fire two years ago, during an investigation into the murder...
...of a witness who was going to testify against him.
two people saw Dean Keaton walk into a warehouse he owned...just before it blew up.
they said he went in to check a leaking gas main.
it blew up and took all of Dean Keaton with it.
within three months of the explosion, the two witnesses, they were dead.
one killed himself in his car.
the other fell down an open elevator shaft.
let's get this show on the road.
this is not what we discussed. There are too many
I promise we'll be out before he blows his porch light.
I have a noon meeting. - Five minutes.
everyone calm down, all right?
I want you to ask this man about the shootout in the harbor.
he says they were buying-- - Dope. We know.
he doesn't know what they were buying, but not dope.
people. - What?
he needs guarantees...
what is he talking about, guarantees? - He says his life is in danger.
he saw the Devil. Looked him in the eye.
I'm on my way. - No, wait a minute.
ask him to tell him what he told me...
...about the Devil.
who's the Devil?
he was in the harbor, killing many men.
he saw Keyser Soze?
he saw his face. - All right.
tell him to tell her what he looks like.
describe him.
six weeks ago, I get an anonymous phone call...
...telling me I can find Keaton eating at Mondino's, and there he is.
because he never profited from his alleged death...
...and we convicted someone else of the murder we tried to pin on him...
...we had to let him go.
he was dead just long enough for the murder rap to blow over.
and then he had lunch.
I don't know about that.
I don't think you do, but you say you saw Keaton die.
I think you're covering his ass, and he's still out there.
I think he's behind that circus at the harbor.
my bet is he's using you because you're stupid and think he's your friend.
you tell me he's dead, so be it.
I wanna be sure before I go back to New York.
he wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
what lawyer?
what lawyer?
back when I was in that barbershop quartet
you don't think I know you held out on the DA?
what did you leave out?
I could be on the phone to Ruby in 10 minutes.
the DA gave me immunity. - Not from me.
you get no immunity from me, you piece of shit.
every criminal I have put in prison, every cop that owes me a favor...
...every creep and scumbag that walks the street...
...will know the name of Verbal Kint. You talk to me...
...or that precious immunity they grant you...
...won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on.
there was a lawyer.
Kobayashi.
is he the one that killed Keaton? - No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.
convince me.
tell me every last detail.
we arrived in Los Angeles and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.
he had a good reputation. Seemed like a good guy.
still, we should have known better. - How you doing?
good. You? - Not bad. Can't complain.
how's it going, Fenster?
don't need to open it, right?
you must be Keaton.
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.
Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint. - Verbal, the man with the plan.
you interested in more work?
we're always looking for extra work. - We're on vacation.
that's too bad.
I got a ton of work and no good people.
not like you guys. - What's the job?
there's this jeweler out of Texas named Saul.
he rents a suite in some downtown hotel.
he does free appraisals. Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.
the word is, he carries around a lot of cash.
so I figure, I keep the merchandise, you keep the green.
simple. - What about security?
a couple of bodyguards. Nothing you couldn't handle.
give me time to check it out?
I expect nothing less from you, man.
good to see you. We'll call you.
enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.
a friend in New York tells me that you knew Spook Hollis.
the way I hear it, you did time with ol' Spook.
a good man, wasn't he?
I used to run dope for him.
too bad he got shivved.
I shivved him.
better you hear it from me now than from somebody else later.
I appreciate that.
but just out of curiosity...
...was it business or personal?
a bit of both.
like I said...
...you give me a call if you're interested.
is there a problem?
one job.
that was the deal.
one job?
one job?
that's a good one.
Keaton fought it as best he could, but a man can't change what he is.
he can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself.
it took one day with McManus nagging, and we went back to work.
I get out of my car, and the thing is wrecked.
I look in the backseat of the other car, and this woman's totally naked.
I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe. - Get in the car, Saul.
freeze, motherfucker! - Stay right there!
gimme the case. Give me the fuckin' case!
give me the fuckin' case. I'm tellin' you for the last time.
give me the fuckin' case!
come on! - Don't move!
hand over the case.
hand over the fuckin' case.
come on, let's go!
come on! - Bad day. Fuck it.
let's go!
fuck.
looks like a lot of china to me. - Shit.
guys, come on.
what are you doin'? - I'm gonna kill him.
we did it your way, now we'll do it mine.
you gonna kill him? - I'll deal with him.
you'd better, or I'm gonna. - Shut up.
what am I supposed to do with that?
feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain. I don't know what that is.
what do you mean? - I don't know.
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.
who?
I don't know. Some limey.
he's a middleman for somebody. He doesn't say, I don't ask.
you're fuckin' full of shit! - Fuck you.
fuck you. - Listen to me.
we wanna meet him, okay?
that's funny.
he called me last night. He says he wants to meet you guys.
okay, we'll meet him.
I'll call you. - Good. Let's go.
I don't like it. Wait a minute. One more thing, tough guy:
any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.
you're such a tough guy. But do me a favor, all right?
get the fuck off my dick.
No!
put a leash on that puppy.
it's an awful shame about Saul gettin' whacked.
cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.
sooner or later, they're gonna come around askin' me.
you have a sweet night, ladies.
fuck you.
so this lawyer-- - Kobayashi.
came from Redfoot. - Right.
and why leave this out when you talked to the DA?
Dave, someone to see you.
I've been looking all over for you.
you still after that coke that took a walk out of that bloodbath yesterday?
you can stop looking. There was no coke.
I've been in LA County talking to a guy they pulled out of a drainpipe...
...yesterday after the shootout.
he came to this morning, he started talking.
he's part of a Hungarian mob. They dealt with gwats from Argentina.
he says it was definitely not a dope deal.
but there were-- - We know. But he says no on the dope.
this Hungarian tells me they were pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.
they had no time for that kind of product, and no means to move it.
what's the money for? - He didn't know.
no one doing the deal knew except for a few key people.
they were all very hush about it, he says.
whatever it was, it was very sensitive. - I don't get it.
you got the cripple in there from New York?
did he mention Keyser Soze?
who?
just bear with me here.
who's Keyser Soze? - Fuck!
we've been goin' over this for an hour and a half.
what we need to do is find Redfoot and get the hell out of here now.
what we need to do is think.
think back.
somebody with power...
...somebody capable of tracking us from New York to LA.
what the hell are we doing here? - We're waiting.
sit down. - No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.
Mr. Hockney, do stay.
Mr. Keaton.
Mr. Fenster I recognize from his mug shots...
...as well as Mr. McManus.
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint, the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.
my employer sends his gratitude, a most unexpected benefit.
I am Mr. Kobayashi.
I have been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.
what do you want? - My employer requires your services.
one job, one day's work. Very dangerous.
he does not expect all of you to live. But those of you who do...
...will have $91 million to divide between you in any way you see fit.
who's your boss?
I work for Keyser Soze.
who's Keyser Soze?
judging by the sudden change in mood...
...I feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you.
I come with an offer directly from Mr. Soze.
an order, actually. - What do you mean, "an order"?
in 1981, you participated in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York.
the cargo was raw steel, steel which belonged to Mr. Soze...
...and which was destined for Pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor.
a most profitable violation of UN Regulations.
you had no way of knowing this...
...because the fellow shipping the steel was working for Soze...
...without his knowledge.
earlier this year, Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus...
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight out of Newark airport.
the plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring also set for Pakistan.
two months ago, Mr. Hockney stole a truck...
...carrying gun parts through Queens.
gun parts which were set to be destroyed by the state of New York.
they were to be lost in a way station and rerouted to Belfast.
again, Mr. Soze using pawns who had no knowledge.
which brings us to Mr. Kint.
nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's...
...less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence scam...
...By a cripple.
he was relieved of $62, 000.
now, it has taken us some time to find you.
our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in New York.
you set up the lineup.
Yes. You were not to be released until I had come to see you.
it seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Miss Finneran...
...was a little too effective in expediting his release.
holding the rest of you became a moot point.
what about Redfoot? - Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.
Mr. Soze rarely works with the same people for long...
...and they never know who they're working for.
one cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
so, why are you telling us?
because you have stolen from Mr. Soze, Mr. Fenster.
all of you.
that you did not know it is the only reason you're still alive.
he feels you owe him. You will repay your debt.
fuck the debt, and fuck you. How do we know you work for Soze?
I don't think that is very relevant.
all five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg...
...and his bodyguards.
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your involvement.
what's your point? - The offer is this, gentlemen:
Mr. Soze's primary interest...
...is narcotics.
he has been competing, shall we say...with a group of Argentineans for several years.
competing with Mr. Soze has taken its toll.
these Argentineans are negotiating the sale...
...of $91 million in cocaine in three days time.
needless to say, this purchase will revitalize...the diminishing strength of their organization.
Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal.
if you choose, you may wait until after the buy.
whatever money changes hands is yours.
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.
and then you will be free of your obligations to Mr. Soze.
give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.
a gift from Mr. Soze.
good day, gentlemen.
they got my whole life in here, everything I've done since I was 18.
they fuckin' know everything.
everybody I've ever worked with or did time with.
no.
this isn't right. - I don't know.
who's that guy who used to talk about Soze in New York?
bricks Marlin. - He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.
he said he always made five times more money on it than the job was worth.
this guy's a pipe dream.
Kobayashi's using him for window dressing.
I don't know. This is bad.
it's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD. It's a fuckin' setup.
the way I hear it, Soze's some kind of butcher.
a peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher. - There is no Keyser Soze!
who is Keyser Soze?
he's supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German.
nobody ever believed he was real.
nobody knew him or saw anybody that ever worked directly for him.
to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Soze.
you never knew. That was his power.
the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...was convincing the world he didn't exist.
one story the guys told me, the story I believe ...was from his days in Turkey.
there was a gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob.
they realized that to be in power, you didn't need guns...
...or money or even numbers.
you just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't.
after a while they come into power, and then they come after Soze.
he was small-time then. Just running dope, they say.
they come to his home...in the afternoon looking for his business.
they find his wife and kids in the house, and decide to wait for Soze.
he comes home to find his wife raped and children screaming.
the Hungarians knew Soze was tough, not to be trifled with.
they let him know they meant business.
No!
they tell him they want his territory, all his business.
Soze looks over the faces of his family.
then he showed these men of will what will really was.
he tells them he would rather see his family dead...
...than live another day after this.
he lets the last Hungarian go...
...waits until his family is in the ground, and goes after the rest of the mob.
he kills their kids, he kills their wives...
...he kills their parents and their friends.
he burns down the houses they live in...
...and the stores they work in.
he kills people that owe them money. And like that...
...he's gone, underground.
nobody's ever seen him since. He becomes a myth.
a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night.
rat on your pop, and Keyser Soze will get you.
no one ever really believes.
do you believe in him?
Keaton always said:
I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.
I believe in God.
and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.
you give any weight to this?
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser from Justice.
he's got a file on Soze in DC. It's been a hobby of his for a while.
a lot of guys equate him to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.
you've heard of him?
where? On the street?
a few times. You know, outside stuff.
someone working for a guy who worked for a guy who got money from Soze.
shit like that.
it could be an old badge. A hex sign.
keep people from fucking with you when a name meant something.
but you're here. - Shit, yeah.
this guy's trying to walk out of a hospital because he's so afraid of Soze.
I'll run it up the flagpole.
I came clean. I told it like it happened.
so what about how I got there?
it's so full of holes, the DA would've told me to forget amnesty.
you got what you wanted out of me. Big deal.
that's why you never told the DA? - You tell me.
if I told you the Loch Ness monster hired me, what would you say?
turn state's evidence. We'll put you on the stand.
I've got immunity. What can you possibly offer me?
if there really is a Keyser Soze, he's gonna come lookin' for you.
Where's your head?
where do you think the pressure is?
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him, knows where I am right now.
he has the burner on your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.
immunity was just a deal with you assholes.
I got a new problem when I post bail.
why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion.
pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.
the same fuckers that rounded us up are now bailing me out?
fuck you.
you think you can catch Keyser Soze?
you think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught...and sticks his head out?
if he comes up for anything, it'll be to get rid of me.
after that...
...my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
what happened next?
we woke up the next morning and Fenster was gone.
he couldn't handle the idea of slumming for Soze.
he left us a note wishing us good luck...
...and took a chunk of the money we'd scraped together.
then what?
McManus was furious.
he talked about tracking him down and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.
that night, we got the call.
what call?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
let's get the fuck out of here.
we gotta bury him.
with what?
with our hands.
this is nuts.
it's dry fucking sand.
when he rots the surfers are gonna smell him a mile away.
dig, you fuck. - What are we gonna do?
this fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.
I don't know about you, peg leg, but I can run. I got no problem with that.
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either.
you run, and we're gonna be diggin' a hole for you.
you got that?
this ain't my boy we're burying. I don't owe anybody!
so fuck you. - He was my partner for five years.
we did more jobs and I saw more money than you can ever count.
so fuck you!
cause now it's payback! - It's not payback!
it's precaution.
you want payback? You wanna run? I don't care.
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.
I'm not doin' it for you.
I'm doin' this for me.
I'm gonna finish this thing.
this Kobayashi bastard is not gonna stand on me.
after they killed Fenster, nobody would run?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it. - Why didn't you say anything?
believe me, I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.
it was too far-fetched for him.
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.
to a cop, the explanation is never that complicated.
it's always simple.
there's no mystery to the street, no arch-criminal.
you got a body and think his brother did it, you're probably right.
nobody argued with Keaton.
they just set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.
they're coming up.
did you hear me? He's coming up. - He's on his way down.
don't move.
press 20. Do it now.
move.
the answer is "no." - Mr. Soze will be most
listen, cocksucker, there is no Keyser Soze.
mention his name again, I'll kill you right now.
a strange threat. I assume you've come here to kill me anyway.
we know that you can get to us...
...but now you know that we can get to you.
I'm giving you one last chance to call this off.
my employer has made up his mind.
he does not change it. - Neither do we.
you got Fenster, but you won't be able to get all of us.
not before one of us gets through to you.
I believe you. I most sincerely do.
you would not have been chosen were you not so suitable.
but I cannot make this decision. Whatever you threaten me with is...
...ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me...
...if I do not carry out my orders in full.
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.
I just wanted you to know that.
I'm so sorry.
I implore you, believe me...
...Mr. Soze is very real...
...and very determined. - We'll see.
before you do me in...
...you will let me finish my business with Miss Finneran first, won't you?
what did you say?
Edie Finneran.
she's upstairs in my office...
...for an extradition deposition.
I requested she be put on the case personally.
she flew in yesterday.
no matter.
kill away.
you're lying.
am I?
miss Finneran's escort while she's here in Los Angeles.
never leaves her for a moment.
I thought you'd be glad to know she's in good hands.
get some rest. The boat will be ready for you on Friday.
if I see you or any of your friends before then...
...Miss Finneran will be the victim of a most gruesome violation before she dies.
as indeed will your father, Mr. Hockney...
...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint.
I might only castrate Mr. McManus' nephew, David.
do I make myself clear?
we will take care of the two bodies downstairs.
we'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster.
if you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
it's a logistical nightmare.
close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.
there's no tellin' how many more are gonna be below deck.
can we stealth these guys?
with all that coke, they're gonna be ready.
which brings me to sunny point Number 2.
even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.
what if we wait for the money?
ten more men at least.
in my opinion, it can't be done.
anyone who goes in is not comin' out alive.
I'm gonna wait for the money. - Me, too.
did you hear what he just said? - If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.
me, too.
there's nothing that can't be done.
I just can't believe we're gonna walk in to certain death.
the news said it's raining in New York.
what language is that?
I don't know. Russian, I think.
Hungarian?
the package has arrived, gentlemen.
you kids ready?
I would be if I didn't have to stop and answer you.
I'm ready.
McManus, you better be set up in 10 seconds.
I'm ready.
I want you to stay here.
I'm supposed to cover
if we don't get out of this, take the money and go.
I can't
find Edie. Tell her everything that happened.
she knows people. She knows what to do.
if I don't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
what if I-- - Just do what I say.
please.
tell her that...
tell her I tried.
McManus, he's on his way.
I'm there.
one, two, three, four...
...five, six, seven...
Oswald was a fag.
Hi.
how you doin'?
is there a problem?
now.
old McDonald had a farm "Ee-aye, ee-aye, O "And on that farm, he shot some guys
Elvis has left the building.
hold fire. Hold fire. Vamonos!
hello.
why didn't you run?
I froze up.
I thought about Fenster and how he looked when we buried him.
then I thought about Keaton, and it looked like he might pull it off.
a boy found a body on the beach today.
thrown clear of the boat. Shot twice in the head.
two guys from the Bureau identified him.
what else? - His name was Arturo Marquez.
a petty smuggler from Argentina.
he was arrested last year in New York for trafficking.
he escapes to California. They pick him up in Long Beach.
they're setting up extradition, he escapes again.
now, get this.
Edie Finneran's brought in to advise on the proceedings.
new York faxed me a copy of his testimony.
he was a rat. - A big fucking rat.
Arturo was very opposed to returning to prison.
so much so, that he named close to 50 people.
guess who he named in the finale.
there's more.
I'll tell you what I know. Stop me when this sounds familiar.
there was no dope on that boat.
you, stay quiet.
he's here.
I know he's here. That's him. I'm telling you, that's him.
I know he's here!
you can't understand. That's him. - Shut up.
that's him. You hear me? I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!
Where's Hockney? - I don't know.
there's no coke.
what? - You heard me, dumb fuck.
there's no coke! - What the fuck? No coke?
I've been up and down in every fucking room.
there's gotta be coke! - There is nothing!
nothing!
don't you fuck with me.
there is no fucking coke!
I'm out of here.
I told them nothing.
I swear.
I told them nothing. Please.
what the fuck is goin' on?
the strangest thing.
that's what you said. You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.
wait a minute.
are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?
you said you didn't know who it was. - I know there was dope on that boat.
stop stallin'. - I'm not.
you know what I'm getting at. - Get out of my face.
I got immunity. I don't have to take this.
you know what I'm getting at.
I don't know what you're talking about. - The truth!
try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.
I did.
you're lying to me.
you've known this whole time. - I don't know what you're saying.
I did see Keaton get shot. I swear to you.
why didn't you help him? You had a gun.
he was your friend.
because I was afraid.
afraid. - Afraid of what?
afraid of-- - I knew it was Keyser Soze.
it was Keyser Soze, I mean, the Devil himself.
how do you shoot the Devil in the back?
what if you miss?
let's get back to the pier.
Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him? - What? No.
he was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department.
he swore out a statement to federal marshals...
...saying that he had seen and could positively identify one...
it says right here in the report.
he had intimate knowledge of his businesses, including...
...but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I never heard of him.
his own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians.
most likely the same Hungarians that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.
the money wasn't there for dope.
the Hungarians were going to buy the one guy...
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.
I said I never heard of him. - But Keaton did.
Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition advisor.
she knew who he was and what he knew.
there were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit.
a suicide mission to whack out the one guy...
...that could finger Keyser Soze.
so Soze put some thieves to it...
...men he knew he could march into certain death.
you're saying Soze sent us to kill someone?
I'm saying Keaton did. He left you behind for a reason.
just do what I tell you.
if you all knew that Soze could find you anywhere...
...why did he give you the money to run?
he could have used you on the boat. - He wanted me to live.
a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world...
...finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple?
no, sir. Why?
Edie.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute.
even if I did...
...I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her.
so why?
because he was my friend.
no, he wasn't your friend. Keaton didn't have friends.
what are you doing here?
he saved you because he wanted it that way.
it was his will.
Keaton was Keyser Soze. - No.
a man who could wrangle the wills of men like Hockney and McManus.
a man who could engineer a police lineup...through all his years of contacts in NYPD.
the kind of man who could've killed Edie Finneran.
she was found yesterday at a hotel in Pennsylvania...
...shot twice in the head.
what do you think about Keaton now?
Edie?
he used all of you to get him on that boat.
he couldn't get on alone. He had to pull the trigger himself...
...to make sure he got his man...
...the one man that could identify him.
this is all bullshit.
you said you saw him die.
or did you?
you had to hide when you heard the police cars.
you said you heard the shot before the fire...
...but you didn't see him die.
I knew him. He would never-- - He programmed you.
he programmed you to tell us what he wanted you to.
he knew we were close. You said it yourself.
where was the political pressure to protect you from?
it was Keaton.
immunity was your reward. - But why me?
why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?
why me? I'm stupid. I'm a cripple. Why me?
because you're a cripple.
because you're stupid.
because you're weaker than them.
if he's dead...
if what you say is true, then it won't matter.
it was his idea to hit the taxi service, wasn't it?
come on, tell me the truth. - It was all Keaton.
we followed him from the beginning.
I didn't know.
I saw him die.
I believe he's dead. Christ.
you're not safe on your own.
you think he's...
I don't know.
Keyser Soze's a shield, or like you said, a spook story.
but I know Keaton, and someone is out there pulling strings for you.
stay here and let us protect you. - I'm not bait. I post today.
you posted 20 minutes ago.
capt. Leo wants you out of here.
unless you turn state's. - I'll take my chances.
if someone wants to get you, they're gonna get you out there.
turn state's evidence. You might never see trial.
maybe so.
but I'm not a rat.
fuckin' cops.
excuse me, can I use your fax machine?
you'll have to sign for these, Mr. Kint.
one watch, gold.
one cigarette lighter, gold.
one pack of cigarettes. Thank you.
we still got nothing.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
which is nothing.
no matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...
...if Keaton is alive, he's not comin' up again.
I'll find him.
waste of time.
a rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.
what?
nothing.
man, you're a slob.
but it all has a system.
it all makes sense if you look at it right. You gotta stand back from it.
you wanna see a real horror show? See my garage.
convince me. Tell me every last...
when I was in that barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...
Where's your head? - We need to think, think back.
I'm sure you've heard tall tales.
bricks Marlin. - This isn't right.
I just wanna hear your story. - It's all there.
I'm tellin' it straight. - Some guy in California called Redfoot.
a gift from Mr. Soze. - Talk to me.
what about Redfoot? - Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.
using pawns... - A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.
there was a lawyer...
Kobayashi...
when I was picking beans in Guatemala we made fresh coffee.
I know you thought he was a good man. - I know he was good.
you tell me every last detail. - The strangest thing.
how do you shoot the Devil in the back?
this guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of...
what's your story, pretzel man?
there was a lawyer. - What lawyer?
I am Mr. Kobayashi.
Kobayashi. Kobayashi. - Tell me every last detail.
I work for Keyser Soze. - Convince me. Convince me.
every creep and scumbag that works the street...
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.
the cripple, did you see him?
the cripple! Which way did he go? - He went out that way.
I know you know something. I know you're not telling...
I'm smarter than you...
...and I'm gonna find out whether you like it or not.
to a cop, the explanation is never complicated.
it's always simple. - The truth!
there's no arch-criminal behind it all.
somebody with power, somebody who is capable...
you think a guy like that gets this close to getting caught...and sticks his head out?
because you're stupid. Because you're a cripple.
what I wanna know is, who's the gimp?
you've known the whole fuckin' time.
if he comes up for anything it'll be for me. I'm sure Keaton is dead.
I can't feel my legs, Keyser.
first thing I learned on the job. You know what?
how to spot a murderer. - You got the cripple in there?
did he mention Keyser Soze? - Who?
after that...
...my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...was convincing the world he didn't exist.
and like that...
...he's gone

doctor?
Mr. Takagi?
Mr. Hiroshi Takagi?
so, you don't remember? Not even my face?
l see.
never thought you'd f orget this mug.
l. . .
I think everything's mixed up.
you had an accident.
you were out driving.
a truck crashed into yours. The driver admits it's his fauIt.
l had you taken to my old university hospital.
we were the ones who ruined it.
after aII this time.
he said himself that he'd never make it as a dOctor.
I wonder why.
ever since he was young he told us he wanted to be a doctor.
but somewhere aIong the way he became Iost to us.
he's f orgotten alI that now.
you okay?

medical College Admlssions Ceremony
congratuIations on entering medical colIege!
what do yOu want to Iive here for?
do you have to move out?
Ah, and there's your coIlege?
I suppose it is near.
look, l'm worried.
does it have to be here?
the ovum, a product of aImost pure chance. . .
. . . by means of ceIlular growth, divergence and migration. . .
. . . creates an organism.
this person experienced trauma to the frontal IObe section.
this area is responsibIe f or personaIity and memory.
from this we can cOncIude the foIIowing:
human character is not a constant. . .
the Brain and spinaI cord f orm the centraI nervous system.
nerve celIs are concentrated in this area.
I wonder, then. . .
where the souI lies. . .
beneath this, however. . .
. . . there is the vast reaIm of the unconscious.
lt is here that our suppressed desires. . .
. . . can cause deep mentaI conflict as they strive to reaIize themseIves.
Hey!
l, er. . .
when streaking the petri sampIe take your time, Or you'II contaminate it.
very good, Mr. Takagi.
Wow! Yours is excelIent. How do you do it?
how's mine?
what a mess!
lt's contaminated!
what are you lot up to? Back to your places.
stop joking around.
why are you telling me this On the phone?
and how can you say it so IightIy?
so my Ms. Yoshimoto is after Takagi?
you can't take your eyes off him.
scary. SO you've been spying on us?
what's wrong with you?
ls it about the entrance exam?
about Takagi being top?
that's why you changed tack, eh?
or you approached me onIy to know the result?
for the price of sweets you shouId be more carefuI.
you sneak y BlTCH!
I understand you want to be alone.
but don't brood too much.
I had some of your furnlture taken there, and put ln the same place.
I thought it would help you remember.
Flrst.Ikuml YoshimOto SecOnd.HlroshI Takagl
I'm third. lkumi beat me again.
Hiroshi, you're second.
ExcelIent!
how did you dO it?
Teil me your secret.
Hey, everybody!
Dr. Nakai has been found, dead.
he hanged himself.
it's stiII not officiaIIy announced yet.
but l heard it in the research Iab.
who's Dr. Nakai?
the microbioIogy teacher.
no, you're kidding.
so, dissectlon classes are startlng, eh?
it's llk e a doctors'lnltlation ceremony.
so far, what you've dOne has been a walk in the park!
come this far In 3 years, and that's the best Of all.
slnce you started medicIne l swear granddad's plcture has started smlling!
medicaI history stems from wanting to understand the body's mechanism.
Dr. Genpaku Sugita was amazed by the similarity in Dutch anatomical texts. . .
and his texts. So he worked on transIating them.
eventuaIIy " Kaitai Shinsho " was pubIished in 177 4 in Tokyo.
trust your own eyes. This is the key point, whatever the century.
the truth is there f or you to see. You must embrace this concept.
as students of medicine you are very priviIeged.
you have the opportunity to expIore the bodies bef Ore you.
treat them with respect at aIl times. We owe thanks to them and their famiIies. . .
first, take off the vinyl sheet.
only remove the cover from the area to be dissected.
it protects the cadaver from drying.
for today, remove the whoIe cover.
inspect yOur sub ject.
are there any Operation scars?
make a thorough inspection.
make a Iong verticaI incision here.
then make a Iateral incision.
take this corner piece.
ls it usual f or a subject to be so young?
no, it's very rare.
l wonder how she died.
you'II find out as you dissect.
what's wrong?
because it's her neck?
no.
don't peel too thickIy.
the tendons will stick to the skin.
we use thOse when we say " ee " .
there, beneath the skin in the neck.
she's hopeIess.
remember her " spectacuIar " speech in cIass?
human body as being an antenna and such? " What a joke.
you want this?
how many times did this heart beat?
seventy times a minute is 4200 times an hour.
so in a day? WelI, 24 times that. Then times 365 f or a year.
how many times if you Iive to 80?
and yet my TV broke after 6 years.
was anything wrong with this heart?
there's something wrong in the Iungs.
see, l can't get my hand in very far.
there are 2 or 3 white lumps in the Iiver.
and look at the coIon.
this person had a coIostomy.
cancer of the colon can easiIy move tO the Iiver.
why did this person die?
Mr. Takagi?
I don't know.
we can't tell by the organs aIone.
we'II find out later.
l wonder what she was like.
shame to die so young.
l must have dozed off.
I had an awful dream.
l nearly remembered the dream.
and why did l think of that?
who told me?
that story about Martian robots.
you want to hear?
do it to me.
me too.
most men are so fierce.
you're better f or me.
today was reIaxing.
don't get me wrong.
l'm nOt as easy as you may think.
what's up?
you're so distant after class today.
lt was me who kiIIed Dr. Nakai.
I dated him bef ore coIIege.
an oIder friend introduced us. l was asking about this schooI.
he had a family, but he was kind to me.
but things got wrong, and I grew apart from him.
he left no wiII, and no one knew about us.
l tried to think it wasn't my fauIt.
my parents were aIways happy to see me.
some funny-Iooking reporters were teIIing us about war and such.
ln our house the sun was aIways shining.
so after a whiIe. . .
the fact that Dr. Nakai was dead. . .
just didn't bother me.
l wonder what it was like f or him.
harder.
do it harder.
what's up?
nothing. I'm okay.
watch this.
what?
bye bye "
leave it!
I thought I'd get sOmething from drawing.
turns out I got nOthing.
they Iook reaI to me though.
as f or me, I'm not sure if l am 'reaI'.
lt's like as if I am sIeeping and dreaming.
so, you liked drawing.
are you going to be a dOctor?
everyone thought I wouId be a doctor.
my parents, reIatives, even me.
when I dozed off here the other day l f eIt like I'd slept f or a Iong time.
what?
l'm remembering something else.
l can't quite grasp it.
I wonder what it is.
when you're " there " can you remember things from " here " ?
but if that were the case. . .
l see.
look. . .
l know we have to take things sIowIy.
but she died in the car crash that day.
don't worry. It was not your fauIt.
her name was Ryoko.
she passed away bef ore you woke up.
the body that l'm dissecting is. . .
Ryoko's body.
l don't think it can be a coincidence.
l did hear she wanted to Ieave her body to science.
other than that, I don't know.
if what you think is true. . .
that would be surprising.
thank you so much.
why have you come here?
just go away.
your parents were very sincere about their grief.
what I realIy want to see is your sincerity.
you were driving when it happened.
l stiII feeI you murdered my daughter.
lf you want to mourn her. . .
. . . do it when you truly remember her.
l'm starting to remember already.
right now, at college. . .
l'm doing my dissection practice.
there is something I need to know.
if you can telI me. . .
Ryoko is on the dissection table.
l don't quite understand it.
are you serious?
well?
Teil me it's not true.
you want to know if it's her?
right?
you heartless FUCK!
how the heIl shouId l know?
just bef ore she died she told us.
leaving her body to science.
we didn't know you even couId.
and now you think you're poking around inside her?
what kind of a quack's schooI is that?
I'm getting On the phone.
it's despicabIe!
ln fact, fuck the phone.
I'II go there in person.
Dr. Kashiwabuchi.
yes?
what is it?
sorry, nothing.
sir.
may l dissect my sub ject aIone?
Why?
the others are making such a mess.
no, you can't. lt's our first attempt.
there are bound to be mistakes.
what's the matter?
what's wrong.
nothing.
today we wiII observe the faciaI muscIes.
take off the head covers.
Where're we heading?
what wouId it be Iike to smash into something?
wouId it hurt?
l rememBered the dream l had.
you hate me!
well, why then?
you've not made Iove to me yet. Why?
ls there someone eIse?
is there?
dancing?
she never danced when she was aIive.
your memory is stilI mixed up.
it isn't a memory.
l was there with her.
not a memory of myseIf.
I mean the real me. I was there.
and what kind of " dance " was it?
the one that Ryoko did.
you make sure you take good care of Ryoko's body.
if not, the school wiII be in troubIe.
and l'II kiII you.
l carry a big knif e all the time.
Hey.
my wif e is iII.
you shouId keep coming round.
teII us about your time with Ryoko.
I'm going now.
do you have to?
but where dO you go?
I'II see you again.
stay with me a IittIe more.
but we can't, right?
l'll come again soon.
what is it?
may we be moved to another group?
Why?
it's just that. . .
Mr. Takagi?
Yes.
the other 3 haven't complained.
lt's just a matter of time.
what?
what's your proBIem?
Mr. Takagi, put your gIoves on.
Mr. Takagi.
sir, l think there's an operation scar here on the head.
l see.
and a bIood clot on the other side.
that could be the direct cause.
a graduaI hemorrhage, probabIy.
do you think she regained consciousness?
between the operation and the blood clot?
lt's quite possibIe.
our 4-month dissection program, like the rainy season, wilI end soOn.
make sure your inspection has been detailed and thOrough.
you're making fine progress.
I suppose studying hands-on helps you remember.
l guess.
that's good. l'm happy f or you.
but try nOt to get too absorbed.
Dr. Kashiwabuchi was a IittIe worried.
you're becoming more distant as time goes by.
dad. . .
. . . when l saw her on the dissection table. . .
I couIdn't understand at aII.
but now I know much more.
it's Iike. . . she made her Own way there.
pIease cOme back to us.
you strangIe me too.
grab me!
please, Hiroshi.
you want to die, right?
let's do it together!
strangle me!
strangle me!
do you have to gO?
I'II come Back soon.
no.
No! No!
please don't go.
what's the matter?
I'II be back soon.
you'II see me soon.
No! No! Don't go!
hello. Mr. HIrOshl Takagi?
Yes.
this ls the pOlice station.
we have a young woman here. . .
she won't tell us anythlng, not even her name.
all she gave us was your name and phOne number.
l'm sorry we had to call sO late.
you are Mr. Takagi?
so, you turned up.
what's got into you?
why are you chasing a dead wOman?
what about those of us still Iiving?
aII your happy, faIse memories. What chance do I have against aII those?
Mr. Takagi.
PIease, Mr. Takagi.
please, step back!
be carefuI!
Mr. Takagi!
look out!
l'm confused about " time " .
what is my consciousness?
is it Iike the story of the future robots?
that's it.
peopIe programmed robots with their memories.
after that. . .
. . . all the humans died out.
a robot was stranded on Mars.
bef ore the end there was a huge, eIectrical memory surge.
so, me being here, and the times when l meet Ryoko. . .
. . . it's like the robot is showing me.
an eIectricaI broadcast of my finaI moments.
it's because your memory is returning.
they're memories.
as f or Ryoko.
weII, she's gone now.
no, that's wrong.
they aren't memories.
lt's not as cIear-cut as that.
l think. . .
no good to think too much about her.
and the dissection.
you shouId stop doing it.
no way.
you've done your best.
but it's time to give up.
No!
l don't care what you say.
l'II teII Dr. Kashiwabuchi to take Ryoko's body away.
you do that, and I'II kilI you.
l wanted to think you had kiIIed her.
but the light had gone from her eyes Iong bef ore that.
lt was when she was in high schooI.
she was fine before then.
why did she Iose it, l wonder.
even we didn't know. And we'll never know nOw.
l only saw the Iight one other time.
just after the accident.
it was after the operation at the IocaI hospital.
your dad suggested she be moved to the university hospital.
that was it.
she was fuIly conscious f or 5 or 6 hours.
it was then she mentioned leaving her body to science.
after she died. . .
. . . her body shouId be tak en to the university hospitaI, she toId.
l've never seen her so serious.
but that wasn't easy to accept f or me.
no way.
why shouId she want to infIict mOre wounds, even after she died?
l couIdn't understand why she wanted this.
how could I agree to that when she was stilI there, aIive, in front of me?
soon after that she lost consciousness.
a vegetabIe, according to the doctor.
she was moved to a private room.
my wif e and l were beside her.
lt f eeIs Iike a dream now.
just when l thought " It's alI over " . . .
I saw RyOkO sitting up in bed.
I thought she had recovered.
my wif e was asIeep.
l saw the curtain at the window.
lt was moving gentIy in the wind.
Ryoko looked so refreshed.
she looked out of the window.
then she turned slowly to me.
don't f orget my request " , she said.
she spoke as plain as day.
she died that same evening.
when she's finaIIy Iaid out. . .
put these in her coffin.
lt's okay now.
you can f orget about her.
you must be tired, too.
not at aII.
I stiII have a long way to go yet.
it's not right.
I don't care that his memory was aff ected.
it's not natural.
it's unforgivabIe.
ln a way. . .
. . . it reminds me how you were when they brOught you here.
how couId they refuse when you were so serious.
aII the memories of you came flooding back.
lt was frightening.
l have to finish up now.
just another minute.
well?
all right, you can take her.
no, hold on. Just another minute.
why putting it off?
l think it's better that I take her now.
we'II take good care of her here.
lf l'd known this wouId happen, l wouIdn't have asked you to bring her here.
lt's just coincidence. . .
that she became Hiroshi's subject.
makes no diff erence you asked or not.
I can't change the ruIes.
l didn't want to die
where do l gO?
l'm scared.
l'm scared to be aIone.
I'm sorry.
l'm reaIIy sorry.
l won't leave you.
I'II aIways be by your side.
l won't Ieave you aIOne.
this is reaIity.
this is reaI.
I'm going to stay here.
and we'II have a baby.
Yes!
Yeah!
Hey!
our 4-month dissection program is now over.
check that bones and organs have been repIaced.
check the kidneys are on the correct side.
put the sash next to the hands.
the hose and sandaIs go by the f eet.
the trianguIar cIoth and the headdress go by the head.
drape the kimonO over the body.
place the cane next to the right hand.

let's mOve.
this way, pIease.
we're ready, Mr. Ohyama.
okay.
lt's time.
ls Hiroshi here?
how's his memory?
much better.
so wilI he be giving up medicine?
we toId him it's his own decision.
and he said. . .
he'll continue.
lt's time.
lt is time to Iay the body to rest.
it's Okay. You have to be brave.
it is time to part.
let us pray.
you know, l often thlnk. . .
lf you could see some part of your lIf e again, years after you die. . .
. . . whlch part would you choose?
the last images of the last Martian robot.
mankind's flnal memory.
you stIll have so long to live, so you can't answer properly.
as for me. . .
Ah, it smells wonderful.

Where's Manny?
tell him the ice cream man is here.
freeze. Hammer time.
can we get down to business?
you got the money?
tell him.
he said that he's not gonna give you one red cent until you tell him what flavor the ice cream is.
vanilla. That's what you ordered.
tell him. -Okay.
it's all about the Benjamins, baby!
bring in the stuff.
arnold Schwarzenegger, funny man!-He's funny like that!
there is your ice cream.
tell him. I see it coming. He says I tell him, I say Jesus.
he is coming, and he says tell him. -He says FBl. You're under arrest.
he's going to run. -No, he ain't.
you owe me $1.
where are you going, big boy?
Goddamn. Now I'm going to bust your ass.
is that all your big ass got?
enough. -Kevin.
all right, you two over here. Right now.
I swear I'll shoot both of you.
damn, Marcus, why you always got to pick the biggest dude?
I don't know. I like a challenge.
see, what did I tell you?
we did it, right? Didn't I tell you?
no help. No backup. -You the man.
we'll get all the credit. The biggest bust of our career.
400 keys of pure Vanilla ice cream? -What?
my man! Where's the drugs?
I know nothing about drugs.
I sell ice cream. Strawberry. Vanilla.
Neapolitan, for example.
tell Manny his ice cream delivery is here.
never mind. Wrong store.
FBl. Freeze!
Marcus? -I'm good.
they're moving. -Let's go.
which one? -I don't know.
God. -Damn.
I told you we should've called for backup.
you know the Chief's gonna kill us, right?
you know the Chief's gonna kill us, right?
let me give you guys a little tip.
if you're going to operate outside the channels do the whole renegade cop thing, you might want to make sure that you get the right guy.
chief, we almost had the guy.
our intelligence was just a little off.
wait a minute. Intelligence?
look around you, Copeland. There's nothing intelligent about this.
now I'm tired of your escapades. I want them to stop.
the last thing I need is to be the laughingstock of the Bureau.
and furthermore, the hold on. Hello? Baby, I can't talk.
the Chief is chewing my ass right now. I got to call you back. Bye.
sorry, Chief. -As I was saying Gordon here.
Yes, he is.
it's for you. -Thank you.
baby, I'm still with the Chief. -No respect.
no, he's really not happy now.
okay, I got to go. Bye. Thanks, Chief.
you guys are... Get this place cleaned up.
I expect to have a full report on my desk tomorrow.
Yes, sir. -And in the meantime , I'm checking with the Bureau to see if they got any openings in lraq.
the Dynamic Duo strikes again. Way to go, Baskin and Robbin.
or is it Haag and Dazs?
Haag and Dazs. You wrote that?
that's good, I like that.
later, Haag. -Adios, Dazs.
I hate those guys, dude. -Oh, God.
all right. Well, let's get this place cleaned up.
all right. -Okay, so, you do the floor.
clean all the ice cream up and I'll go warm the car up.
okay. So much for a hot meal.
Hey, baby. -Don't "hey, baby" me.
I can't believe you have me sitting here all night worried about you.
all night? Baby...
it's only 8: 00.
look, after work, me and Kevin went down to the bar and had a couple of drinks.
I know. I called the bar. They said you left at 7: 45.
I checked MapQuest. It only takes six minutes to get there from here.
so, if you got somebody on the side, you need to tell me.
baby, listen to what you just say.
mapquest said it takes six minutes to get here. I got here in eight.
which means there's two minutes unaccounted for.
if I was cheating on you, don't you think I'd need more than two minutes?
you know what? I ain't going to deal with this.
I'm tired, okay? I had a long day at work. I got shot at.
see, that is exactly what I'm talking about.
we don't communicate.
okay, fine. You want to communicate? -Yes.
come on. Let's communicate. Okay?
okay. Let's start with last week.
last week.
you and I were supposed to go shopping together. We get to the mall.
I buy this beautiful dress, I get my hair done.
you don't say anything. I don't know, maybe you just don't want to...
did you hear me just now?
tell me what I said.
I heard everything. You was communicating.
don't play with me right now. I am not in the mood.
I cannot believe you came home late and then you start...
Marcus! You are falling asleep again. I am talking to you.
I wasn't asleep, I was closing my eyes and visualizing your words.
Oh, really? Visualizing?
why don't you paint me a picture of what I just said?
hold on. -You know why?
because you are falling asleep again. Marcus!
well, if it isn't Ben and Jerry.
let me ask you guys a question.
when the Chief goes to the bathroom, which one of you guys holds his balls...
and which one wipes?
that's the ball holder there. -Yep. You can tell by the cup in his hand.
see, that is exactly the attitude that's going to keep you guys working the shit detail while we're working the socialite kidnapping case.
you guys got the socialite kidnapping case?
that's right.
what's that? Oh, I think I hear the Chief flushing.
we'd better get going. Whose turn is it to wipe? Yours?
I think it's your turn to wipe and I'll hold the balls.
that's right.
we received this from Mr. Andrew Wilson, CEO of Wilson Cruise Lines.
it was delivered to his home. The girls in the photo are his daughters and heiresses to the Wilson fortune.
we believe they are the kidnapper's next victims.
Mr. Wilson has given us permission to shadow his daughters.
we're going to set up surveillance and if the kidnapper strikes this time we will be ready.
now, the Wilson sisters will be flying into JFK this morning.
so who's going to pick them up?
obviously, everyone has read the profile on the girls.
still, somebody's got to do it.
I don't think this is a good idea.
I don't care. We deserve to be on this case just as much as Gomez and Harper.
I know, but we don't want to interrupt the man in a briefing.
well, somebody got to stand up to him.
chief. -What?
Marcus has something he want to tell you. -What?
chief, we just want to know if we could get on the case.
you're on.
the boys over at lntel seem to think that the kidnapper's a guy named Ted Burton.
it says Burton was a partner of Wilson's and some other associates in some business venture that failed.
says he spent time in the Federal pen and lost his fortune.
guy's been MlA since his release and those dates coincide with the first kidnappings.
what do you think? -I think this babysitting gig sucks.
dude, relax.
look, man. All we got to do is pick these chicks up drop their ass off in the Hamptons, then we back in the Chief's good graces.
I didn't join the FBl to become a nanny.
I want to be on the street where the action is.
okay, Blackie Chan, and you'll get there. Can we just do this first, please?
all right. -You didn't put dairy in this, did you?
no. -Because you know I'm lactose intolerant.
last time, I barely made it to the bathroom.
why would I want to disturb your stomach?
there goes your girls.
come on, man. Let's do this.
Hi, I'm Kevin Copeland. This is-- -We already gave to the United Negro Fund.
wait. Hold on. -Excuse us.
we're actually here to escort you ladies to the Hamptons.
the bags are on the plane. Take Baby and clean out his bag.
he didn't have his colonic and he like pooped everywhere.
what's this? -Baby got to ride in the car seat.
where the hell am I supposed to sit?
this ain't right.
man, you guys sure got a lot of bags for a weekend.
this isn't a weekend. -It's the weekend.
labor Day in the Hamptons. The last weekend of the social season.
only the hottest people are going to be there.
and only the hottest of the hottest are going to make it onto the cover of Hamptons Magazine. And this is our year.
open the window. Baby likes a little fresh breeze.
I just hope the Vandergeld sisters' private jet crashes on the way there.
Oh, my God, Brittany! -You were thinking it!
I know, but you said it. -I know.
you know Heather totally hates you because you slept with her boyfriend.
my God. So what? I sleep with everyone's boyfriend.
is everybody all right?
my God! Your lip.
my God! Your nose.
Marcus, are you okay?
I'm cool. -Baby's in a wreck!
I can't believe you think we're going to go to the Hamptons with my face looking like that.
it's really not that bad. Just get some makeup and cover it up.
put makeup on this?
I am so fricking pissed.
my God, this is like the worst day of my life.
I went to go get my brows done and I told her to make me look like J-Lo.
and then that fricking Russian toad made me look Iike Liza Minnelli or something.
Oh, my God! I'm going to have a B. F.
wait. What's a B. F?
she's going to have a bitch fit!
you better get out of here. -I am going to call your boss.
you don't have to do that. -No, I'll call the owner of the company.
come on, just take it easy. Look, we can work this out.
I'm going to write a letter. -No.
please don't write a letter. Look, just calm down.
you guys just stay here. Stay here the whole weekend.
do whatever you want. But whatever you do, do not leave this room.
don't leave this room, because if you do, everyone's gonna see those hideous scars.
scar?
my God! Permanent damage. -My life is over.
if I lose this job with these good benefits, Gina's gonna kill me.
well? -They won't go.
what do you mean, they won't go? -They won't go.
Marcus, this weekend in the Hamptons means everything for these girls.
they won't show up with a scratched-up nose and a busted lip for nobody.
that's cool.
what are you doing?
I'm just going to kill myself before the Chief does.
Bye-bye, Kevin. -Come on.
don't do that. Stop being ridiculous.
I'm not being ridiculous. You heard the man.
one more screw-up, and we're through.
I know, man. -See? That's probably him right now.
Hey, what's up, Chief?
there's something me and Kevin want to tell you.
Yeah, Chief? Hey.
me and Marcus just wanted to thank you for the opportunity, man.
no, we didn't.
Yeah, we really appreciate it.
they wanted to stop off and get something to eat.
he's lying to two, three hours max.
trust me.
if I don't have them there in three hours, I'll cut them off and mail them to you myself.
all right, take care. Bye. -He lied, Chief.
why did you do that? You know them girls aren't going to be there.
they'll be there.
Hey, Josh.
how'd you like to be part of the team?
where are the white women at?
let's do this.
he's right. Make them bigger.
chief. They're here.
all right, the girls are yours. Stick with them. Don't blow your cover.
Yes, sir.
are you sure this is going to work? -Just trust me. Follow my lead.
what's up, money? You got a problem? What you looking at my ass for?
no, yo, hold my poodle.
what's up? Y'all got a problem? Y'all want some of this?
you want some of this, punk? What, boy?
I'll take the both of you. -Let's get out of here.
I got this for you. Kiss my black ass! -Cut it out.
he was looking at my ass like I'm a girl. -You are a girl!
and you better start acting like one or you're going to be an unemployed girl.
damn. I'd sure like to cut that cake.
here, yo, hold this!
Hey, you trying to look at my lumps?
I'll pull off my G-string and handle mine.
I'll handle mine. -Kevin, it's Gomez.
welcome to the Royal Hamptons Hotel.
the bags are in the car, Jose. -The name is Gomez.
whatever. -Yeah, great. Here. Take Baby.
clean out his bag. Poor thing just pooped everywhere.
and teach him how to say, "Quiero Taco Bell.
thanks a lot, Rico Suave. Grazie. -Thanks, Julio.
right away, ma'am.
sweetie, you've got to slow up with those Cosmos.
Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, checking in.
sorry. They're new.
Dr. Dorfman did an amazing job. -They feel so real.
Hi. Yeah, I just... I need a credit card, please.
and some lD, please.
credit card? ID?
I'm so fricking pissed.
ma'am, l-- -First of all...
I go to Dr. Dorfman. He totally messes up my nose job.
I ask him to make me look like Gwyneth Paltrow.
I get off the surgery table looking like freaking Shrek.
then I get here, and Mr. Harper makes me feel like I'm some dumb blonde with fake boobs going to a Hugh Hefner party.
no. I didn't mean to offend you.
it's just protocol. -I'm going to have a B. F.
my God. She's going to have a bitch fit.
no. Don't have a B. F. now
I want to speak to your supervisor. Better yet, I'm going to write a letter.
miss, there's no reason to-- -You are in big trouble.
dear Mr Royal Hampton.
'"l am a white woman in America." -Ladies, is there a problem here?
Yes. -No.
there's no problem.
these are two of our VlP guests.
issue them keys. Immediately.
Yes, sir.
VLP. Learn your acronyms.
what a sweetheart. -Here you are. Enjoy your stay.
has anyone ever told you you look just like Denzel Washington?
Yes, actually I have heard it once or twice.
what a beautiful chocolate man.
beautiful. God.
that was close. -Yeah.
are they waving at us? -I don't know.
what are we going to do? -Just act friendly.
my God.
well, don't act like you don't know us.
Karen, Lisa, Tori.
Oh, my God.
I haven't seen you in forever.
it's only been a year.
did you do something different to your hair?
no. -You gain weight?
no. -I know! You just had a birthday.
Yeah. -Totally. Total fire sign. I knew it.
I totally knew it. -Wait a minute.
there is definitely something different about the two of you.
collagen.
you little witch. How did you know?
duh, it's totally obvious. Your lips went from Cameron Diaz to Jay-Z.
you got taller, too.
we got our knees done.
you can do that?
you should do that. -Yes.
well, it was really good seeing you ladies. Bye.
excuse me. Where do you think you're going?
to go freshen up.
the Hamptons Magazine reception just started, so let's hit it.
Hey, check it out.
are those the Wilson sisters?
more like the Wilt Chamberlain sisters. I never noticed how big they are.
but I'd still bone.
my God. There's Heath.
dude, are you hitting Karen Googlestein, the soap heiress, too?
how do you keep that shit dangling?
I keep telling her I'm going to break up with my girl.
you better hope Heather doesn't find out.
she won't.
at least until I wrap up this big deal with her father.
Hey, Mr. V.
and look, there they are. The fen-phen twins.
they're hot.
what, are you blind?
that's Heather and Megan Vandergeld.
your sworn enemies since you were like, I don't know. Eight?
did I say hot? I meant not.
I totally hate them. -Did you guys hear about Megan?
she got stopped by security at Saks trying to pull a Winona.
God. Come on.
this is going to be fun. -Move.
look who just flew in from the slums of Beverly Hills.
it's The Beverly Ho-billies.
squeeze me? -No, you didn't.
I'm sorry, but we just saw your new video.
they had a screening over at Saks Fifth Avenue in the security office.
a klept-ho-maniac.
your mother shops at Saks.
what?
my God. You want to talk about mothers?
you want to talk about mothers.
it's mother time. Okay.
your mother's so dumb she went to Dr. Dre for a Pap smear.
something's wrong, Dr. Dre. My coochie's doing a beatbox.
yeah? Well, your mother is so stupid...
she exercises when she could just get liposuction or something.
your mother's so old that her breast milk is powdered. You breast-feed like this.
your mother is so, like...
she's so...
Megan, you go.
your mother is so stupid that she goes to Barneys Rooftop Deck Restaurant for lunch and orders a nicoise salad and calls it a "ni-coise" salad.
Ni-coise" salad, right?
your mother's ass is so hairy it looks like Don King's about to pop out and say, "Only in America!"'
your mother's so stupid that she goes into Gucci and she tries to buy, like, Fendi and stuff.
Megan, Heather. Come on now, girls. Is this any way to speak to your guests?
Brittany and Tiffany Wilson.
I haven't seen you since you were smaller.
Yeah. Well, we're all grown up now.
Yeah, I can see that.
ladies, I fully expect to see you later at the White Party.
I think it's gonna be the best one ever. -We'll be there.
take care. Bye. Good seeing you again. -Bye, Mr. V.
this isn't over yet.
this is a long weekend. You better watch your back.
ladies. -Whatever.
I can't believe you guys just did that to the Vandergelds.
you know, they could take you off the scene just like that.
Yeah, but it was so cool, you guys. -So cool.
isn't that Denise Porter from NY1 News?
Yeah, I'm working on getting you an interview with her.
great for your image.
I think I'll go over there and introduce myself.
do you think now's a good time? -Actually, it's a perfect time.
wouldn't want to miss a photo op. -Never that.
see you later. -Have fun.
what's wrong? Did you just get cramps? -Yeah.
do you need a tamp? -Heating pad?
hors d'oeuvres? -Thank you, Wolfgang Paco.
would you give that to Baby? Thank you.
Bye, Chico. Vamonos. -Bon appetit.
I'll have one.
Hi, my name is-- -Brittany Wilson, of course.
Yeah. How'd you know? Brittany Wilson.
well, it's my job to know.
your publicist, Tori, has been calling me nonstop about setting up an interview.
if I would've known you were so beautiful, I probably would've called you myself.
well, if I wasn't mistaken, I'd think you were flirting with me, Miss Wilson.
me? Flirting with you? A girl? Never.
sorry, honey. I don't eat sushi. Strictly beef.
boy, you're really strong, aren't you? -It's from all that protein.
my God. These are delicious.
you might want to slow down on the cheese.
you mean, there's cheese, as in dairy cheese?
Yeah. Unless you know another way to make quiche.
ladies, I think I got to go to the bathroom. -Good. We'll come with.
no, I can handle it myself. Thank you, though.
like we're going to let you go alone.
time for touchups anyway.
move, bitch.
my God, you guys. Heath is here. What should I do?
I don't understand what you see in him.
he's an out-of-work actor living in a share house.
and he drives a 3 Series BMW.
Tori, I really think that you need to cut Heath a little bit of slack.
his aunt died three years ago and he really needs new headshots.
he's just going through a really rough time right now. Okay?
you okay?
everything all right in there?
it's fine. Shit.
tiff, we're just going to meet you outside. Okay?
love you.
man, it may be summertime in the Hampton but it is snowing up in here.
Tony, hand me my boots because I'm about to go skiing.
great game last night, Latrell. -That's what I do, baby.
now that's what I'm talking about.
a white girl with a black girl's ass.
I'm taking that home to Mama.
pardon me.
Santa must've come early this year because you were first on my Christmas list.
there it is, right there.
I want to know. Are you naughty or nice?
sorry, I'm not interested.
I'll take that as naughty. -Naughty.
you know what they say:'"Once you go black, you're going to need a wheelchair.'"
Hey, Latrell. I had a great time last night.
okay, call me later. -As I was saying...

somebody had to stand up to those guys. -They're the "it" girls.
that's the way it's always been. -Whatever.

no, a powder for my nose. Quick.
Thanks.

gentlemen, get out your wallets because you'll be bidding on a date with some of Hamptons' most eligible bachelorettes.
first up, yours truly.
who wants to start the bidding?

would you ever do anything like that? -Well, it's for a good cause.
besides, being wined and dined by a rich guy might be nice.
I see, so you like rich guys?
it might be a pleasant change from all the losers that ask me out.
$3, 000. -That's good.
I see.
but I think that we can do better than that.
$20, 000. -Sold.
$20, 000. That is a new record.

Yeah, I got $2, 000 right here.
3000.0

I'm sure no one will wish to go higher than that so we can just be done with it now.

I don't want to go on a date with Buff Daddy.
come here, baby.
dude, my feet are killing me.
and on top of that, that G-string gave me diaper rash.
how long we got to do this, man? -Just a couple more days.
I don't have a couple of more days. Do you know who my wife is?
here, listen to this message. She's losing her mind with another woman doing what I think you're doing!.
you don't want to hear the rest.
by the end of the weekend, we'll be heroes and all will be forgiven.
all right.
you order room service? -No.
who is it?
Damn! These girls won't quit.
we'll be right there. We're coming. Hang on.
open up! -Open.
one second.
we'll be right there. Hang on.
the ice cream's melting!
hold tight, girls! We're just shaving our feet, okay?
and braiding our vaginas.
what, did you guys forget? It's your turn to host the slumber party.
okay, you guys. What does it mean when a guy is in a really bad relationship and it's really obvious that he wants to be with you but he just can't seem to break up with his girlfriend?
it means you're a total booty call.
my God! Brittany! -Well, you were thinking it.
well, you said it.
you know, sometimes you sound just like a man.
so I've been told.
what she means to say, honey is maybe you're just making yourself just a little bit too, like, available.
come on, you guys.
don't act like you haven't done it before.
you know how it is when you really care about someone.
you call them all day long because you just wanna know how their day is going and what they're thinking about and if they're thinking about you.
you spend all day trying to find the perfect outfit.
you even change your hairstyle just so he'll take a second look.
but they never notice.
sometimes I just wish that they could trade places with us so that they would know how it feels. You know?
Oh, my God. Look, it's Megan's commercial.
I won't let genital herpes slow me down. That's why I use Valtrum.
Hey. You want to play with me?
sure.
I won't tell if you won't.
I so could have done that part. She doesn't even have herpes.
all done. -Really?
my God! This is so cool.
you know something?
I think you might have been black in a previous life.
fo' shizzle, my nizzle.
okay. Enough of this girls' talk, ladies.
it's time for some real fun.
Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about.
come on. Show us some of your skills.
Yeah, totally. Learn some of your skills.
actually-- -Go for it, sis.
Tiffany's the expert. -Yeah, but you made the video.
come on. Show us.
you see, the first thing you do is you gotta grab the thing here.
not too tight or you'll get calluses.
then you want to look that little sucker in the eye and go: '"Come here, little guy.Come here, you little earthworm.'"
you like that? I learned that from an Eskimo porn.
come here.
and then I'm going to teach you guys "The Deep Throat.
you want to make sure the passage is clear all the way from your throat to your chin and you want to place the thing here.
and you just wanna...
Oh, yeah. You like that? You little freak.
guys like that? -They love it.
and another thing they love is this.
they love...
you like it? I call that "The Headbanger.
don't you ever put it in your mouth? -Never.
never put it in the mouth. That's '80s.
you might as well go and buy a TransAm.
okay. I'm ready. I think I can do it.
good catch.
so you take the thing and you grab it but gentle, not to get calluses. Not pretty.
then you look him dead in the eye and you say: Good boy.
you're scaring me.
and then comes the Headbanger.
Yeah. Tap.
well done.
all right, I got another one for you. Carmen Electra or Pam Anderson?
easy.
but they both got a yeast infection.
now that's tough.
I'm going to go with Pam Anderson. -You're disgusting.
what? -They got a yeast infection.
who would you choose?
Hey, Gomez. We got a couple of bogeys.
no time. -Oh, come on!
it's Pam Anderson, like you care.
run their faces. Let's go.
Brittany Wilson? -Yeah, that's me.
let's get her.
put the blindfold on her! -Damn, this girl's strong.
who do you work for? -lntimate Fantasies!
my God. You need help?
what are you doing? Those are the strippers, Raoul and Tito.
strippers?
I thought they were going to kidnap me. -That's part of their routine.
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.
hotel security! Is everything all right here?
everything is fine. Just a little case of PMS. That's all.
I'm just one big, emotional wreck.
could you guys go get me some Midol and a Snickers?
let's get out of here. -My ass is fat.
this is Harper. It's all clear.
okay, ladies. Let's focus. We have to find the perfect spot.
would you look at these starving kids in Africa.
when I see them, I just want to cry.
I mean, why can't I be that skinny?
it's okay, Megan.
just think. They can't wear belly rings with those bloated tummies of theirs.
that's true.
I feel so much better.
skank alert.
my God, girls. I totally forgot my suntan lotion.
Hey, bro. Go long. I got a plan. Go.
Hey, yo! You do that again, I'm going to bust...
I'll bust out in tears.
lnbreds! -You're a jerk.
my bad, sweetheart. Over here. Don't hurt yourself.
don't worry, I won't.
sorry. Better lay off the spinach.
Tony. Let's go hunting.
I'm so glad I got waxed today. -Me, too. What did you get?
the Bald Eagle. -I got the Bermuda Triangle.
the Landing Strip.
I got the Buckwheat.
disgusting.
what a beautiful, sunny day.
Oh, my God. What happened to the sun?
easy, white chocolate.
I wouldn't want you to melt.
Yeah. Hasta la vista, Schwarzenegro. Bye.
Hey, kids! You guys want to make $5?
okay, here's what I want you to do.
Yeah, I'll take the usual. And put it on my tab.
Hey, Latrell Spencer! Could we have your autograph?
sure, little buddy. -Thanks. You're the greatest.
Hey, that's what I do, baby.
sweet! -Nice!
Hey, stay in school. -Okay, we will!
Wow! You must be pretty good. -I'm all right.
sometimes I feel I should be paying them to take my autograph.
I'm sorry, I didn't even get your name.
Latrell. Latrell Spencer. And you are?
Denise Porter. -Denise. Denise Porter.
you know, you look so familiar. I feel like I've seen you somewhere.
no. I play pro ball. Maybe you've seen one of my games.
no. But I mean if I did, I'm sure I would've definitely remembered you.
okay, well. Look, Denise...
I don't mean to be too forward or anything...
but I'm here in town, checking out some real estate, and
Oh, whereabouts?
you know, up around over there. -ln Montauk?
more like around-- -East Hampton.
just all over the place. It's one big blur.
one big, business blur.
I kind of want to get away from all that business and hang out with somebody and have a real conversation.
so, I was wondering if you're not too busy, maybe we can hang out? -Yeah, sure.
Really? All right. Cool! -Yeah.
so, I'll pick you up at about...
you know, the jet should be here about 7: 30 and the limo will take about a half-hour. About 8: 00. Is that good?
Yeah, 8: 00 sounds great. -8: 00 sounds good? All right.
goodbye. -Take care.
Hey, where's our $5?
all right, calm down.
here you go. $5. $2. 50 each.
you promised to give us $5 each. -Stay in school.
cheapo.
I am not making excuses. I refuse to believe it.
I am not making excuses. I refuse to believe it.
Really? -I don't want to believe Marcus is cheating.
I don't wanna believe Michael Jackson keeps carving up his nose.
excuse me. Your card has been declined for insufficient funds.
the rep's on the line.
Yes, this is Mrs. Copeland.
$4, 000 dress? And where did I buy this dress?
the Hamptons!
Yes, I remember.
thank you.
it is on.
I don't see why I got to go out with Mandingo and his anaconda.
cause if you don't, you'll blow our cover.
what you gonna be doing?
me? I'm going to follow up on a lead.
you're going on a date.
she's a reporter.
who else knows more about the Hamptons people than her?
all right, so I like the girl. You're the one always telling me to settle down.
and you should.
but that don't mean I got to go with Buffy the White Girl Slayer.
all right. Look. Just go to dinner. Okay?
I'm only gonna be a couple of hours and I'll meet you back at the club.
you promise? -I promise?
I'm serious, dude. Promise.
I do. I'm serious. All right.
tell Latrell if he needs a condom...
there's an extra shower curtain in the bathroom.
hop in.
take your time. Watch those marshmallows.
ease on in there, now.
I won't bite unless you ask me to.
you are so beautiful.
good boy, Baby.
how about we listen to a little bit of music?
what the...
how did you know? I love this song!
making my way downtown, walking fast
faces pass and I'm home bound
and I need you
and I miss you
and now I wonder
if I could fall Into the sky
do you think time would pass me by. Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
if I could Just see you tonight -Good evening, madam. Welcome to Bella. -Thank you.
what are you doing here?
I came to borrow the car and the keys to his house.
are you crazy? If you crash this man's car, he will kill you.
I won't crash it. Look. Just call me before you leave. I'll bring it back.
then you meet me back at the club.
no, my brother. You got to get your own.
help me.
thank you.
may I bring you something from the bar?
let me have a bottle of your best champagne.
and bring us some oysters. -Very good, sir.
I have to say, I was so...
I was happy when I bought you at the auction.
I mean, it's very rare I have the opportunity to bask in the ambience of such a classy lady such as yourself.
Oh, my God!
I am humbled by your... -This athlete's foot is just killing me.
...beautiful nature. -That smell. That's infection.
the most high-classness of your... -My God. Is that a hangnail?
captivated by your beauty.
your bountiful curves remind me of the hills in ltaly.
I'm sorry. You were saying?
that's perfect. Thank you. -Are you ready to order?
Yes, I'll have the chicken. White meat only.
and for the lady, perhaps a salad?
perhaps not. I'll have the steak, smothered in onions.
a rack of ribs. Pasta with extra garlic.
french fries with lots of vinegar and a side of onion rings with lots of sauerkraut.
have you ever had oysters?
did you know oysters are an aphrodisiac?
sorry.
my tongue's kind of big.
it'll open. Hold it!
I'll push. Yeah. See, that did it there.
just a little turn.
there's so many keys involved...
sometimes it's hard to figure out what's what.
it's Mei Ling.
what are you doing here? Girl, it's late!
come on, now. You have to go home. Get some rest.
you cannot stay. There are laws against this kind of workmanship.
they'll think I'm running some kind of sweatshop.
that girl does not know when to go home.
I'm telling you, she will stay here and just clean forever.
this is really nice.
Yeah, this is dope.
dope summer home I picked, boy.
who's that?
the big, buff, bald dude with the fur?
that's my trainer.
you have your trainer on your wall?
Yes, well, for inspiration. I want to look like that one day and...
I come in every morning and I look at the... You ever see Titanic?
no, I haven't seen it. -Me, either. You want something to drink?
Yeah, sure. A glass of wine would be nice. -Wine.
okay, so I'll get you a glass of wine and...
that'd be in the kitchen, right?
I don't know. This is your house, Latrell.
who? Oh, me! Latrell.
that's right. I'm Latrell. That's right.
I'm going to get you a bottle of my wine in my house.
it's my house and I live here
damn, little lady!
you sure can put it away.
you're so funny.
voila!
you have a dog.
no, I don't have no damn dog.
well, then whose dog is that?
shit.
that's not no dog.
that's family.
Hey, cousin.
come here, boy.
he looks really mad! Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. He just misses me, that's all.
okay, boy, playtime's over. Let me up!
you want me to go for help? -No, we're just having fun.
you sure are playful today.
you want to go for a walk, boy?
I'll be right back!
you know what? Forget this! I'm out of here!
I don't want to go on a date with a guy and his dog is biting him and...
what's he doing now? What's that?
don't pay him no mind.
he's just going to do that until he falls asleep.
now, where were we? Wine!
you know, I like a woman with a little extra something.
a little cushion for the pushing.
I'd really love for you to come to one of my games.
no, thank you. I've seen you play. Not impressed.
excuse me? I'm the highest scoring forward in the league!
but all that talent totally overshadowed by nothing but scandals and pure laziness.
come on! You're shooting under 50% from the free throw line, okay?
your turnover ratio, abysmal.
and on top of that, you can't shoot three-pointers to save your life. So...
squeeze me.
no one's ever cared like that before.
come here, baby!
Oopsie! I had a poopsie.
girl, we're going to get along just fine.
back at you!
bask in the ambience! -I'm going to be sick.
so, no. I jump over the fence, fall. I scrape my knee.
get out of here. -No, seriously, listen.
I scrape my knee. I get chased by the cops and I spend the night in jail.
that's insane. You did all that just to find J-Lo and Ben's hideaway?
I can't help it. You know, investigative journalism is my passion.
so how'd you end up writing puff pieces for the local news?
unfortunately, I made some enemies and ended up getting fired from my last job.
what happened?
believe me, you don't want to know about that.
look, I spent all night talking about myself.
sometimes it's good for a man to just sit back and listen.
well, since you put it that way.
I did this piece on Warren Vandergeld.
him and his partners tried to swindle a guy.
you talking about Ted Burton?
Yeah, how did you know that?
it was in the paper. I read about it.
but what they didn't report in the paper was that Burton was 10 times smarter than all of them.
he embezzled millions and stashed it in an offshore account.
when Vandergeld heard the story was going to break，he didn't want to be embarrassed.
well, there goes my job.
you know, you're a good listener.
it seems like you have the whole package.
man!
Hello? -Kev, you got to go.
what? Now? -Yeah, now. We're on our way.
can't you stall him for a little while?
look, this man sang to me. He tried to kiss me and on top of that he been farting for the last 20 minutes.
all right, I'll be there in a minute. Bye.
cottontail! -I'm coming, nigger!
Gomez, what the hell are we looking for?
I don't know. Something just isn't right about these girls.
I'm gonna check the bathroom.
find anything?
no. Not yet.
you won't believe what l... What the hell are you doing?
sniffing chicks' underwear, man. What is the big...
it's... What?
they're guys, aren't they?
you really are disgusting.
can I buy you a drink? -Buzz off, Smallville.
Oh, my God. I so don't get it.
guys think if they buy you a drink, it's a free ticket into your pants.
well, it's not.
what can I get you? -I'll have a Panty Dropper.
screaming Orgasm. -A Slow Comfortable Screw.
I've had that before. That's a good drink. -Don't drink too many.
yo, Latrell. -What's up?
excuse me, baby.
Latrell, my man! What's going on, brother? -What's up, man?
two apple martinis. -You hitting that, bro?
this is a tough one to crack. -Tiffany Wilson?
the ex queen?
here. Drop a couple of these babies in her drink, man.
are you sure this will work?
man, I just took two of them, and I'm telling you I'm boinking someone tonight, you know?
excuse me.
that's for you, my little Miracle Whip.
you need to loosen up. There you go.
that's for you.
Oh, my God! Is that Britney Spears? -Where?
right over there. Forget it, she just left.
Oops, she did it again.
let's drink up. -Let's do it.
to the last drop.
that's good. You want to dance?
you know, that's a great idea. Here, hold Baby. Let's go, girls.
I found out some interesting information. Ted Burton turned the tables on Vandergeld.
tucked away $100 million.
been living the high life ever since he got out of prison.
there goes our motive.
those skanks think they're hot?
let's show them what sexy really is.
they want to battle. Let's go, girls.
you girls want some of this?
bring it on, sisters!
okay, let's do it!
come on.
hold on.
I know you hookers don't think this is over with.
let's kick it old school.
they suck!
Oh, my God!
we won!
come on, let's go.
get out of my way! Move it!
I need a drink.
Hey, Latrell, my man.
so did it work, man?
I don't know.
but I got to dance.
I got to hit this.
hold the dog.
let it out.
Oh, yeah. Now it's out.
I paid thousands of dollars on this outfit and do you think he even noticed?
it's going to be okay.
little Miss Vandergeld walks in...
and he just forgets all about me.
okay, let it out.
I wonder if he would think she was so hot if he knew that she is broke.
Vandergeld's broke?
we mustn't talk of such things.
no, we won't.
but, yes, they're broke.
my father even had to loan her father money...
just so that they could keep their house.
they just paid us back.
you guys, I love you guys. -We love you, too.
I love you so much!
thank you.
can we get you some gum or a mint or something?
Hey, little girl.
Really? I love you, too.
what the hell are you doing? Give me her!
sicko. Where's Latrell?
dance floor.
good morning, snowflake.
Oh, my God. Brittany!
what? -We're on page six.
no. -Yeah.
look. "Wilson sisters rock Hamptons.
wilsons rock! -We rocked!
wait. We weren't in the Hamptons this weekend.
No! We've been cloned!
he's got to be around here somewhere.
girl, wait a minute. Isn't that Marcus right there?
that's him, all right. Old lying dog! -Caught you.
that sounds like Gina.
don't answer it. She'll go away. -No, she won't.
I'm not going anywhere until you open this door!
I told you! What am I going to do? -Just get rid of her.
I'll get rid of her. You hide the stuff.
I'm not playing with you! -Coming, baby!
what is all that noise?
nothing! Okay, baby, I'm coming!
I'm coming. Hide.
Hey, baby! Hi, boo-boo.
nice room you got, Marcus. -Hey, baby, what you doing here?
I could ask you the same question. -Me?
I'm on assignment.
are you wearing lipstick?
no. That's Kool-Aid. You want some?
you know, it's filled with lots of vitamin C and riboflavin.
is that a bra?
no, this?
this is the new holsters they gave us at work.
they're government issue. You can put two guns in there and just...
freeze, FBl!
I know somebody's in here. -Baby, nobody's in here.
see? Nobody's in here.
check under the bed-- -What do you mean, "Check under the bed"?
I heard somebody on the phone. -Check under the bed!
that's where everybody hides! Check it! -Marcus! Nobody can fit!
see, nobody here, right? Nobody there.
I'll look in the bathroom. -Wait! No! Don't check the bathroom!
you don't want me to check the bathroom!
see? Nothing in the bathroom. Nobody in the room. See?
I told you no one was here. See?
you know, baby, this gotta stop!
we can't have love if we don't have trust. -I know, but look.
I was at the restaurant and the card wouldn't go through
listen. If we don't have trust, we don't have nothing.
this is not about trust. This is about...
there she is, right there!
now, baby. I can explain.
I knew it. -Baby, it's not what you think.
baby, it's not what you think. -Don't you even say nothing to me!
I can explain. Baby, it's not what you think.
he's a man!
you're sick!
there's a lot of lovely ladies here today, boys.
Hey, Russ.
what happened to you?
I fell.
we have to find them and stop them before they execute their evil plan.
wait, what do they look like? -Duh, us!
afternoon, ladies.
the Chief would like to have a word with you.
my God, Tiffany. They're the Men in Black.
come on.
easy, Ponch and Jon. My hair! -Let's move it along, pal.
wait a minute! -Let's go!
chief, we just got confirmation that Burton's arrived at JFK.
I want him trailed. Give him plenty of room. I don't want anyone jumping the gun.
I want to get this guy red-handed.
get your hands off of me! -Let's go.
Hey, easy! -Right this way, girls.
what the hell you guys doing with the Wilson sisters?
chief, these aren't the Wilson sisters. -No, sir.
chief, check this out.
my God! What are you doing?
that's on there pretty good. -Let her go.
that's nothing, Chief.
how about...
those are nice. -That's enough!
I don't know how he did that...
but you can't fake these.
my God! Look who's here. It's that beautiful.
save it!
because of you, I had to suspend two of my best agents!
chief, I can explain. -I don't want to hear it!
you're just lucky we caught Burton before he could strike.
but Burton is not our guy!
let me guess: Women's intuition?
you're both fired.
turn in your guns and your badges. This operation is over!
come on, Chief! You can't fire us. -I just did.
forget him, Marcus. We can do this ourself.
look, all we got to do is-- -Wait.
we"? Kevin, this ain't about "we.
it's never been. It's about you.
you come up with some stupid idea and I'm dumb enough to go along with it.
and look where it's gotten me, Kevin.
I just lost my wife and my job because of you.
so don't tell me about "we" no more, all right?
they bought it. The FBl is packing up.
they'll be out of our hair in a couple hours.
we could make the grab tonight.
you sure you and your friend can get the job done?
would I let you down, Mr. V?
Hey, man. I just want to say sorry. -Forget about it, dude.
no. You're right. You're absolutely right. I've been selfish.
I'm always dragging you into everything. I never even asked what you want to do.
I don't know, there's something about always having you around, that just makes me want to step up my game.
I guess it's because I always know you're gonna have my back.
Hello?
Thanks.
who was that? -That was Josh.
turns out that Vandergeld's prints was all over the ransom note.
what are you doing? -Calling the Chief.
no, you ain't! You said we could do this on our own, right?
what about backup?
I got you, you got me. That's all the backup we need.
triple T-K-A.
time to totally kick ass!
three generations at the Bureau and I'm the first to get fired.
my dad is going to kill me!
yeah? What? Who?
Copeland! -Copeland, you dick!
you've got a lot of nerve, calling.
where?
you better not be wrong about this. -What?
we might be getting our jobs back. -What are you talking about?
we gotta go. -What do you mean, go?
how about this? Ru Paul or Whoopi Goldberg?
I told you, I'm not playing your games. -Come on!
any sign of Vandergeld? -I don't see him.
all right, keep an eye out for him.
if it's going down, it's going to go down here.
thank God! There you are! I did it.
you did what? -I got you into the fashion show!
Brittany, did you hear that? We're in the fashion show.
not if we don't get moving. Come on, let's go!
get the lead out, ladies. -I mean, it's like you forgot.
you mean the Wilson sisters are in? -And we're out?
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is. They're hot, you're not! So deal with it.
you! Straighten up that blouse, now! -That's impossible!
we've been on that catwalk every summer for six years straight!
let's just cut to the chase.
who do we have to sleep with for us to get in the show?
honey, you're so barking up the wrong tree right now. Really!
if you nail this, you're a shoo-in for the cover of Hamptons.
darlings! Where have you been?
Megan! Don't!
this is unacceptable.
they just messed with the wrong girls!
I've been looking everywhere for you.
can we get the Wilson sisters their outfits now, please? Go.
can we talk? -Of course.
you were incredible at the nightclub last night.
thank you. Thanks. -lncredible.
and Heather will be leaving after the party tonight, and I was thinking maybe you could come by around 2: 00?
make that 3: 00 a. m.
you know what?
I don't think so.
excuse me?
you think I'm just a booty call.
well, I'm not.
I deserve better than that.
I'm tired of being your doormat.
honey...
what makes you think you're that special?
bastard. -Excuse me.
asswipe!
you're going to regret that. -I'm so scared.
Oh, my God! Tiffany!
thank you so much, honey. -I am so proud of you.
Thanks. I just wish I didn't feel so crappy.
honey.
sometimes a man can't see when he has someone so special...
sitting right in front of him.
are you, like, a lesbian?
I better go get changed. -Okay.
ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are proud to present the fall couture line, Aubrey Allure. Please take your seats.
excuse me? -You're not on the list.
invitation, my ass! They don't know how we do it.
let's just blend. -All right.

they changed that quick! -Amazing!
these ought to get the critics' attention.
second changes, everybody! Go! Now!
this'll be a nice little treat.
my God! What's happening?
that's not mine!
let's get out of here!
I'm sorry!
just give me your hand. It'll be okay.
I'm so sorry. Oh!
come here! I got you!
here we go. Up!
my God! -I hope she's okay.
I'm ruined.
looks like some people just don't know when to quit. Come on, girls.
help me. -I got you.
Karen, what are you doing?
look, someone has got to give those girls a taste of their own medicine.
so revolutionary! It's so bold and so...
so brilliant!
everybody, they're imposters!
hit the lights.
Where's Brittany?
where are you?
get down!
I told you you were going to regret it.
you hit like a bitch! Come on.
you run and I'll shoot you. Come on.
my turn. -Mama?
girl, we going to need some backup.
girl, call Nay Nay and La Quanda.
tell them to bring the Vaseline and the straight razors.
these bitches are on some other shit!
what's going on?
don't touch my dress! -Vandergeld's got Tiffany!
what? No one messes with my queen!
Marcus! Are you okay?
no. -What's wrong?
these damn G-strings are killing me!
Freeze! -FBl.
you guys take care of them. We're going after Vandergeld.
Copeland! You're going to need this.
come on, let's go.
FBl! Freeze!
daddy, what are you doing?
why don't you take your mother and your sister and go on home?
daddy, why are you doing this?
daddy didn't tell you? He's broke.
what do you mean, broke?
like Martha Stewart broke or MC Hammer broke?
mc Hammer broke! -No!
I've been funneling money out of the charity into a private account, just to get us by!
are you filming this?
I'll give you something to shoot!
get out of my way! -I can't do that.
drop it!
I got you, man. Man, we'll get that stain out. Don't even worry.
don't move!
warren Vandergeld, you are under arrest!
I just want to tell you, I appreciate what you did. That was real brave of you.
I had no choice. I couldn't let them take my one true love away.
Hey, dude. I'm not what you think I am.
baby, we all got secrets. That's okay.
are you telling me that you are not...
Yeah. I'm not a woman. -White?
the deception! The betrayal, man! You deceived me!
calm down. I'm an FBl agent. I was uncovering a
Negro, please!
didn't somebody tell you this was an all-white party?
someone get this jigaboo away from me!
are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
so, do I get to see my knight in shining armor?
well... -Get a leg!
get off me!
what do you mean? I'm going to let you have it!
you ain't never met nobody like me! -It's me!
you don't know who you messing with! My name's Gina!
it's me.
this is some Jerry Springer shit!
once again, you guys managed to do everything I told you not to do.
you caused over $250, 000 worth of damage.
two people were shot.
but at least you got the right guy.
good work. -Thanks a lot, Chief.
but we couldn't have done it without Gomez and Harper.
all right, I'll see you all in the office tomorrow.
good work, guys.
who will be featured on the cover of Hamptons Magazine?
I have to take care of some business.
see you guys on Monday.
so, who do you think wore those panties you were sniffing?
Kevin or Marcus?
Gomez, I told you. I was looking for DNA. -Oh, yeah.
what are you laughing at, "Denzel"?
Oh, what a beautiful chocolate man!
you guys got some work to do?
I'm Denise Porter. Good night.
I'm Kevin Copeland. I'm an FBl agent.
I make $30, 000 a year after taxes.
I don't drive a Bentley and I don't have a house on a hill.
but I'd really like to take you out.
are you kidding me? Any man who would jump in front of a bullet for me can definitely take me on a date.
come on, girl, let's go. -Wait, could I just please
I have nothing more to say to you. -I know. Just listen to me, please.
Gina, I lied to you.
I've hid things from you.
but I have never cheated on you. But I am guilty.
I'm guilty of paying more attention to my job than I do my wife.
I'm guilty of not appreciating all the little things you do for me.
like getting your hair done.
wearing that sweet-smelling Chanel cologne I love so much.
but my biggest crime is that I didn't tell you I loved you every single day.
you're not going to let him off that easy. -Will you shut up?
I love you.
a wheelchair?
Yes, but the feeling will come back, I promise.
making my way downtown. Walking fast
faces pass. And I'm home bound
backup, Tony.
Hey, girls.
so you guys were pretending to be them the entire time?
Yes, we were. But we was only doing our job.
I hope you guys aren't too pissed off at us.
we're so bummed!
we liked Brittany and Tiffany so much more when you were them.
so much more!
so I guess this means we won't be hanging out any more?
don't say that. Of course, we will hang out.
Oh, yeah. We'll all get together and we're gonna go...
shopping!
guidance counselors get to find out all sorts of interesting things.
now l want you two to kiss.
come on, now.
never let the sun go down on an argument.
l told you they were gonna make us look stupid.
Hey, you're right. They did make us look stupid.
what you're wrong about is why.
all right, hear me out.
lombardo was having an affair with Sandra Van Ryan, right?
why not tell us about it?
that's a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate this story.
maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
l thought about it and said: " You're Lombardo. Your life is trashed.
you don't wanna sit in jail for three months unless-- "
unless what?
unless you're setting Sandra Van Ryan up for the big payday.
lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt before this whole thing started...
...trying to keep up with a pricey girl like Barbara Baxter. That's expensive.
lombardo may be broke, but why would Kelly steal?
kid's got money from her grandfather she can't touch until her mother dies.
l'm telling you, this guy wanted to marry money.
when that didn't happen, he went to work on these two girls...
...using them to set up Sandra Van Ryan.
I'm telling you, they chumped us, partner.
they chumped us right from the start.
nice stroke.
ls there some reason why you're here?
curiosity, l guess. -About what?
how to improve your breast stroke?
no. l want to know how you see things working out for you, Sam and Suzie.
excuse me?
you three gonna go to the Caribbean together?
live happily ever after?
you see, the thing about it is that threesomes rarely work out.
you're out of your mind.
lt's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.
especially when two of them are in love.
you and Sam don't want that pill-head around now that you have the money.
am l right?
Sam sell you on the idea right up front of whacking Suzie? Hey!
that's murder, kid.
police. God, get a life.
you're good, you know that?
but you don't think that little freak Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?
Hello, Suzie.
you better watch it with that shit.
you get busted again, you go back in a two-time loser.
Yeah, or wind up dead.
you know...
...l don't think l ever told you how sorry l was about your friend.
what was his name?
come on, help me out here, Suzie. You know his name.
Davy. -Yeah. That's right. Davy.
l was sorry about the way that worked out.
that is cop bullshit. -What was that? What was that?
l don't have to listen to this. You can't shove me around.
l have friends now. -Hey!
this is Ray, Suzie. You don't have shit!
you never had shit and you never will have shit.
take a look at this.
go ahead, take it. lt's not gonna bite you.
take it!
your friend Sam deposited the check.
he transferred the funds to a numbered offshore account.
cops don't know the names on it. Think one of them is yours?
he also put a down payment on island property and a lease on a sailboat.
you're into sailing, aren't you?
l don't know why you're telling me this. Why are you here?
l'm telling you this because l know exactly what's going on.
two's company. Three's a crowd.
you don't think Kelly and Sam are gonna share that money with you.
leave me alone.
you know...
...l'd want a clear head right now if l were you...
...so l could keep a real close eye on my new friends.
l'd hate to see you come to a bad end...
...like Davy.
Oh, shit.
you've reached Sam Lombardo. Wait for the beep, leave a message.
l can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you?
l'm scared there's no one to trust.
you can trust me.
Hello?
Kelly, is Suzie there? -Yeah.
Christ, l was afraid of that.
she left this insane message.
between whatever she's been smoking out there...
...and this fucking cop, she's gonna blow it.
calm the bitch down.
why can't you come? Please?
Sam, l miss you so much.
l miss you too, Kelly, but l can't right now.
we gotta stick to the plan, okay?
if she can't get a fucking grip...
then what? -You know what.
I'll handle it.
but l need you, Kelly. l need you to be there for me tonight.
okay. -Good.
that's my girl. You're the strong one, you know that?
now, put Suzie on the line. I want you both to hear this.
Suzie.
Sam?
now, look...
...we gotta stay calm, all of us.
now, since the settlement, people think l'm rich...
...so l'm out there spending money, doing what rich guys do.
this cop, Duquette, he's gonna try and fuck with you. Don't let him.
Yeah, that's easy for you to say. -Suzie, don't fall apart.
the only people who can fuck this up is us.
you are gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Oh, for chrissake.
you are!
are you retarded, or just brain-dead from whiffing fumes out in the swamp?
that's what l am to you, isn't it? Swamp trash, just like my mom.
don't!
you stupid cunt!
you are scared, aren't you?
ray! Jesus Christ!
are you crazy? -Hear her say " Sam " ?
that was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the two girls.
the conversation on the tape is unintelligible.
what we have here is you on the Van Ryan property...
...shooting a porn flick! -l can't believe this.
a month ago, they threw things at each other in court.
they were acting! They were all acting!
we bought it, hook, line and sinker.
they're getting away with $8 million from Sandra Van Ryan.
she might have saved it if she didn't try to ruin him.
you wouldn't go after a guy you thought raped your daughter?
she bought the same goddamn story we did!
both of you, you're not on a case, because there is no fucking case!
l've had it with Sandra Van Ryan, and you keep mucking around...
...and she's gonna sue us for invasion of privacy.
so get out of these people's lives! Hey! Ray!
Hey! Am l getting through? -You think this is just about money?
about us looking stupid? Question him.
you'll find a manipulative psychopath, and those girls will wind up dead.
give him something to do.
look into the Kennedy assassination. -l understand.
next time this fucking piece of shit...
...drags me down here, l'm gonna sue you.
you're goddamn lucky l didn't sue last time.
l agree. -Am l free to go?
Yes. -Thank you.
cocksucker. -Yeah, what was that?
you heard me, motherfucker. -Yeah, you wanna say that to my face?
what are you looking at?
l guess l kind of lost it out there. -You could say that.
were you ever in a situation where you saw something coming...
...and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
we all have.
l mean something bad that you saw coming, and then it happened...
...and you-- You didn't do anything, and...
l did that once.
l don't wanna do it again.
l thought we were going to a movie.
l think we just need to get wasted.
Yeah.
come on.
l wanna live at the beach someday.
Oh, shit.
l left the keys.
l'll get them.
Kelly?
Suzie.
lt's me.
l was worried about you, and l decided...
...the three of us should get together one last time before we split up.
are you mad at me? -No, no.
l probably should've told you a bit more about...
...the part l intended to play.
but we'll go through it again tonight.
this is a celebration, Suzie, not a suicide pact.
we're gonna chill out and just relax...
...have a little champagne...
...watch the stars...
Kelly?
you got a blanket in the back of your mom's Rover?
why don't you be an angel and run over and get it for us?
good girl.
let me tell you about the boat l picked out for us.
you okay?
my mom would kill me if she knew l took the Rover.
been four-wheeling?
get off my property! -l'm not on your property.
lf you don't get out of here-- -You'll call a cop? l am a cop!
goddamn it!
so you say she didn't come home last night.
she's been talking about going to L. A. but her clothes are all still here.
Walter! You get sick, it'll serve you right.
found some teeth in an old trailer down the road.
he says they'll fit.
Suzie hasn't been back to school since the trial.
Oh, and now they're saying that she can't graduate.
lt is that Kelly Van Ryan that got her into this whole mess, and you know it.
well, we'll look into it for you, Ruby.
we find something, you'll be the first to know.
come on.
lt's starting, Gloria. This is how it begins.
ray, we don't know anything yet. She could be anywhere.
l'll drop you off. Put a call out on Suzie's car.
you got someplace you wanna be?
you got a date? -Just check the car out for me.
lt's over here, by that old boat.
so you and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, sometimes.
a lot of the kids hang out here.
you really think something bad happened to Suzie?
lombardo ever come out here?
l say something funny?
no, but l mean, just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would
well, the way l heard it, he was pretty tight with the kids.
you and him were pals, right?
Yeah, but he got me onto the sailing team.
told me l could work my way through college, like he did.
Sam Lombardo went to the University of Miami on an athletic scholarship.
boats didn't have a damn thing to do with it.
listen, l'm gonna be here a while, kid.
why don't you go up to the highway and catch the bus?
Hey, Jimmy.
people aren't always what they appear to be. Don't forget that.
this is where they did it. -Where's the body?
the swamp, most likely. Guy's a swamp rat.
he knows it won't be found, but he made a mistake.
she'd been threatening to run away and l found the car at the bus terminal.
you don't think Sam put it there?
hold on a second. Gloria, have the car dusted for prints.
and if Suzie even was murdered, it was that damn Van Ryan kid.
little sociopath's the one who started this.
how long till we get something? -We can get blood type now.
dental records will take longer. DNA could take weeks.
poor, dumb Suzie. Kid never had a chance.
we don't know that. -l'm telling you, Kelly's next.
l'm telling you, you get off this right now.
don't even fucking let me hear about you bothering Lombardo.
David!
you get an lD, you call me!
will you do me a favor?
ray, you heard him.
he told me to stay away. He didn't say anything about you.
what if l'm right and Hunter's wrong?
please, you gotta help me out on this, partner.
and if the teeth aren't Suzie's, you'll give this up?
lf l'm wrong about those teeth, you got my word.
Hello? -I've been calling you.
l wanna see you. -Where are you?
the stupid guest house. -Good. Stay there.
Sam, l'm really nervous.
Kelly, relax.
take one of your mom's Valiums or something.
ln a week, you get on the plane, this is over. We're rich.
but what if they find out?
my God, they'd put you in the electric chair.
look, Kelly...
...stay in the guest house, skip the graduation parties.
l love you so much.
and I love you too, Kelly.
be a good girl and stay where you are.
peeping in people's windows?
lsn't that against the law?
Suzie Toller's missing.
since when? -She didn't come home last night.
we found her car at the bus terminal.
ray thinks she was murdered.
well, l don't know what to tell you.
you could tell me where you were last night.
l suppose l could, but l don't really have to, now, do l?
come here.
l wanna show you something.
looks like goodbye.
Kelly's file.
read it. You're gonna find an angry, sexually confused girl...
...who threatened the lives of at least two people.
what two people?
one of them was her mother.
the other one was...
...a female classmate...
...she may have been sexually involved with.
Suzie?
now you got the file.
read it.
l think it'll give you a new perspective on things.
why didn't you tell us about this before the trial?
because then l had principles.
that meant a lot to me.
now...
...l don't care.
l should probably go now.
unless you're planning on holding me for something.
Duquette. What's happening? -I'm tired. I'm going home.
Where's Lombardo? -He's gone.
goddamn it, Gloria, the blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
let me tell you something, Ray:
there's more to this story than you know.
if Suzie is dead...
...Hunter may be on the right track about Kelly.
ray?
shit, Ray.
who is it? -lt's Detective Duquette.
open the gate, now.
Hello, Kelly. -What are you doing here?
Where's--? Kelly! Kelly!
l just looked away for a second, just a split second.
and just like that, bingo...
...she put a knee in my groin.
l didn't go down, but it slowed me down...
...just enough.
l couldn't get to her.
she turned on me with the gun.
fired one shot.
l took the hit in the shoulder.
l had no choice.
l had to return fire.
two rounds, l think, in the chest.
l went there to protect her.
l went-- l went there to protect her.
detective Duquette.
l spent time in military intelligence, and we had a saying there:
once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence.
three times is enemy action. "
this is twice for you, Duquette...
...and l intend to see to it that there is no third time.
our investigation finds that this was a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.
you ignored the advice of your superiors.
consequently, two young women are dead.
you are, as of now, terminated, with forfeiture of pension and benefits.
chief Goodsall...
...Detective Duquette found Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...
...near the area known as Stoner Beach.
miss Toller's blood was also found in the Van Ryan Range Rover.
this has led this office to conclude...
...that Susan Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.
she-- She didn't.
Mr. Duquette.
Mr. Duquette.
this investigation is concluded. You're dismissed.
thank you, Paul.
howdy, partner.
Jesus, man. l wasn't expecting you until tomorrow.
Hey, nice girlfriend you got there.
Kelly was only supposed to be framed.
the bitch shot me.
shit, you're a cop. Don't they teach you to disarm people?
you know, shoot them in the leg or something?
did you become squeamish about this stuff before or after...
...you bludgeoned little Suzie to death with a wine bottle?
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray. lt wasn't part of the plan.
lt couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly killed Suzie.
l couldn't talk them out of it.
l'm telling you, l don't like surprises.
look at it this way: Every cloud has a silver lining.
now there's no loose ends.
come tomorrow, you'll never see me again.
Oh, listen, about tomorrow...
...l spoke to the bank and they said it's gonna take two working days...
...to make the transfer, so...
bullshit. -Oh, yeah.
call them yourself.
anyway, what's your hurry? Kick back for a day or two.
we'll take out the boat. l just had it outfitted.
l could use a deck hand.
here's to large bank accounts.
you gotta lighten up, partner. You're a rich man.
to large accounts and no loose ends.
and no loose ends.
Hey, Ray, you see that winch?
take a couple turns on it. She's luffing.
you mean that thing? -Yeah, Ray.
we call it a winch. lt's what we use to tighten the sails.
so why don't you start cranking? -This is supposed to be a vacation.
why don't you get a nice powerboat?
come on, Ray. l'll make a sailor out of you yet.
or get me drowned.
lt's stuck.
what do you mean, it's stuck? Put a little elbow grease in it.
lt's stuck, l'm telling you.
the jenny sheet must be caught on something.
why don't you go starboard and see if you can unhook it?
l don't understand a word you said. -Okay, Ray.
you see this line right here? Follow it down...
...and see if you can see what it's snagged on.
you're killing me.
you mean this thing? -That's it. That one right there.
you see anything?
look a little lower.
that's it.
guess l forgot to tell you, Ray:
one hand for the boat, the other one for yourself.
first rule of sailing.
ray!
what happened? -Nice try, motherfucker!
you!
you're dead!
no, l'm not.
Sam.
Sam, for chrissake! -Sorry, partner.
you really shouldn't have killed Kelly.
you shouldn't have killed that kid out in the glades either.
what was his name? -Davy.
that's my son, Walter.
he's been doing this a long time, so don't be afraid. Please, come on in.
thank you so much for coming down to the glades.
did you come here to watch Walter, or is this an official visit?
no. Actually, it's my day off.
l thought you looked different.
l came because l was hoping you would talk to me.
about Suzie?
actually, l was wondering if you would talk to me about Ray Duquette.
he used to come around here.
he had a thing going with one of the girls
girls. Over at the glades.
got sort of hung up on her, from what l hear.
she still work there? -Not after that night.
all l know is, the next morning...
...she was gone and a boy was dead.
Seminole kid named Davy. He had a crush on Ray's whore.
caught Ray slapping her around, and he tried to stop it.
so Ray killed him.
Suzie saw it.
so he busted her and sent her up.
you know, just to prove that he could.
that's all there is to say about Ray Duquette.
to Ray.
we won. Sam, it's over.
Wow. Talk about paranoid. Take a look around us, Sam.
you're gonna have to teach me how to drive this before l can get rid of you.
okay, Toller.
l wanna trim the sail. Grab a hold of that winch.
fuck the winch. l wanna drive. -lt doesn't work that way.
you don't drive it, you sail it.
now, get on that winch.
l just wanna cruise for a while.
that's funny. That's one of the first things l noticed about you, Sam.
you like to cruise.
Suzie. -Take college, for instance.
l bet the classes you took were ones where the finals were multiple choice.
and you never bought the book. You'd find a girl to loan you hers.
and then, of course, you'd have to fuck her after that, right?
ls that how it went?
Yeah.
well, l've got a good pop quiz for you.
multiple choice, of course.
before sailing on the Helios...
...Medea killed King Creon and the princess with what?
a rock?
a spear gun?
or a little poison?
poison!
good guess.
van Ryan got old.
he and his cronies would come here.
hunt and whore. They acted like a bunch of assholes.
one trip, he showed up with this girl...
...He'd picked up somewhere.
gotten her pregnant.
dumped her in the swamp.
poor girl was dead in a year.
that came with her.
and the child?
well, she had it. Before she drank herself to death.
wasn't exactly a love child.
so you're not her grandmother.
l raised her like l was.
but, no. Walt was my only child. He was a good boy.
until the Army took him.
so Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half sisters.
and the other girl, Kelly? Suzie's niece.
well, it may be good news or not. I don't know. We'll start with the letter.
H. -Yes, there are two H's.
nice truck.
selling your boat?
this was Suzie's boat.
guess she won't be needing it now.
funny. l wouldn't have guessed Suzie was a sailor.
old lady had her tested once. They said her lQ was way up there.
around 200 or some such shit.
that girl could do just about anything she put her mind to.
Hi.
what are you doing out here?
l'm running away.
you think that's wise?
guess what else?
l have toys.
l suppose one taste won't hurt.
you know...
...that weekend l got busted, l called you about a hundred times.
l really believed that stuff about you being my friend.
was l naive.
l can't decide what came out better.
that little straw up Kelly's nose or that dildo shoved up her ass.
what do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
seems to like the same places you do.
funny you never met. -Yeah, real funny.
you know, you're wrong about this, and l could get busted on the spot.
trust me. The guy's dirty. He'll love it. Especially the part about killing me.
now, get out of here. Go make yourself a new friend.
what are you drinking?
we gotta stop. l'm gonna come.
that never seemed to worry you at the glades.
that's not your line... -Say you love me.
l love you. Now, give me the line.
no little girl can ever make me come.
you got the pressure too tight. You're gonna crush the evidence.
Oh, for chrissake.
Hello, Kelly. -What are you doing here?
may l ask you a question, Ms. Toller?
did you enjoy being a guest of the state?
l hope l never make you mad.
cash is just walking-around money.
the check is the balance of the numbered account...
...minus the million we set aside for Ruby and Walter...
...less my usual fee.
case closed.
Suzie.
be good.
how you doing, Keaton?
I can't feel my legs...
ready?
what time is it?
it all started back in New York six weeks ago.
a truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of Queens.
the driver didn't see anyone, but someone fucked up.
he heard a voice. Sometimes that's all you need.
Mr. McManus? - Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?
we have a warrant for your arrest. - Fuck you, pig.
who wants to know? - New York Police Department.
shit. - Freeze!
hold it!
sure you brought enough guys?
it's quite simple:
a restaurant that changes with the taste without losing the overall aesthetic.
in other words...
...the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls.
let me give you an example-- - This I had to see for myself.
I'm in a meeting. - Time for another one.
everyone, this is David Kujan.
special Agent Kujan. US Customs.
these gentlemen are from the New York Police Department.
you look good. Better than I would have thought.
a small matter of a stolen truck loaded with guns.
Mr. Keaton?
will you excuse us for a moment?
we have some questions to ask you downtown. You'll be a while.
no. Please, sit down.
this is a small problem.
enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.
it didn't make sense that I'd be there.
these guys were hard-core hijackers...
...but there I was.
at that point, I wasn't scared.
I knew I hadn't done anything they could do me for.
besides, it was fun.
I got to make like I was notorious.
you all know the drill.
when your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given.
number 1, step forward.
hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker.
number 2, step forward.
gimme the fuckin' keys, you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!
knock it off. Get back. Number 3, step forward.
hand me the keys, you cocksucker. - In English, please.
excuse me? - In English.
hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker. What the fuck?
number 4, step forward.
it was bullshit. The whole rap was a setup.
hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker.
it was the cops' fault.
you don't put guys like that into a room together.
who knows what can happen?
hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker.
this has really got to be embarrassing for you guys.
they drilled us all night.
someone was mad about that truck hijacking and the cops had nothing.
they were hoping somebody would slip up and give them something.
they knew we wouldn't fight, they knew how to lean on us.
they've been doing it forever. Our rights went out the window.
it was a violation. Disgraceful.
they went after McManus first. Topnotch entry man.
what truck?
the truck with the guns, fucko. - "Fucko"?
he was a good guy. Crazy, though.
wanna know what your pal Fenster told us?
say who? - McManus.
he told us another story.
is that the one about the hooker with the dysentery?
Fenster always worked with McManus. He was a real tight-ass.
but when it came to the job, he was right on. A smart man.
what are you saying? - I said he'll flip you.
he'll what? - Flip you. Flip you for real.
I'm shaking. Come on. - Okay.
answer my questions. - Can you hear me in the back?
Hello?
I want my lawyer.
I'm gonna have your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.
Todd Hockney: good with explosives.
without a doubt, the one guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody.
you guys don't have a fuckin' leg to stand on.
you think so, tough guy?
I can put you in Queens during the hijacking.
Really?
I live in Queens.
did you put that together yourself, Einstein?
you got a team of monkeys working full time on this?
you know what happens if you do another turn in the joint?
I fuck your father in the shower, and have a snack.
are you gonna charge me, dickhead? - I'll charge you when I'm ready.
with what? - You know damn well, dead man.
Keaton was the real prize for them for obvious reasons.
it was your mistake, not mine.
did you ever stop to ask me?
I've been walking around with the same face, the same name.
I'm a businessman.
what's that? The restaurant business?
no. From now on you're in the "getting fucked by us" business.
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.
like I said...
...it was your mistake ...not mine.
you charge me with this shit...
...and I'll beat it.
okay?
let's get back to the truck, asshole.
really, somebody's got to do something about this shit.
they put me in holding every five minutes. So I did a little time.
does that mean I get railed every time a truck finds it's way gone?
fuck 'em.
Fenster, will you relax?
these guys don't have any probable cause. - You fuckin' right. No PC.
you're goddamn right. You do some time, never let you go.
they treat me like a criminal.
I'll end up a criminal. - You are a criminal.
why'd you got to go and do that?
I'm trying to make a point. - Why don't you make your point?
you're making me tired all over.
fuck it then.
I heard you were dead. - Yeah?
you heard right. - Word I got is you hung up your spurs.
what's that all about? - What's this?
rumor has it Keaton's gone straight. I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.
who's that?
she's a heavyweight criminal lawyer from uptown.
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.
how 'bout it, Keaton?
you a lawyer's wife?
what kind of retainer you giving her?
do your friend a favor...tell him to keep quiet.
Dean Keaton...
gone clean?
say it ain't so.
or was it you that hit that truck? - Mac, forget him.
did you get to talk to your lawyer?
this whole thing was a shakedown.
what makes you say that? - How many times you been in a lineup?
it's always you and four dummies.
the PD are paying homeless guys $10 a head half the time.
there's no way they'd line five felons in the same row.
what's a voice lineup? Public defender could get you out of that.
why the hell was I strip searched? - It was the feds.
a truckload of guns gets snagged.
customs comes down on NYPD for answers. They come up with us.
they're clutching at straws. - I had a guy's finger up my ass.
is it Friday already?
Yeah, lover boy.
you want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.
so who in the goddamn piss hell stole our fucking truck?
what did you say? - Who stole the fucking truck?
I don't want to know. - Who asked you, workingman?
fuck who did it. What I want to know is, who's the gimp?
he's okay. - Says you. How do I know that?
what about it, pretzel man? What's your story?
his name is Verbal.
verbal Kint.
verbal? - Yeah.
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.
I was going to tell you to shut up.
we met before, once or twice. - In County. I was in for fraud.
you were in a lineup then, too. What happened?
I walked. 90 days, suspended.
so you did it. - All right, now look...
...we've all been put out by this whole thing, right?
I figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity.
now, me and Fenster heard about a little job.
why don't you just calm down?
what do you care what he has to say?
I'm just talking here.
it seems to me like Mr. Hockney wants to hear it...
...and I know Fenster's down.
what about you, guy?
I'm interested.
there. See?
I'd like to exercise my right to free assembly.
why don't you just shut up?
you're missing the point.
no.
you're missing the point.
I don't want to hear anything from you.
I don't care about your job.
and...
...I want nothing to do with any of you.
I beg your pardon, but you can all go to hell.
Dean Keaton...
...gone the high road.
what is the world coming to?
fuck him.
and that was how it started:
five of us brought in on a trumped-up charge...
...to be leaned on by half-wits.
I really can't talk about it much here.
what the cops never figured out, and what I know now...
...was that these men would never break, never lie down.
never bend over for anybody.
anybody.
who are you? - Agent Jack Baer, FBI.
how many dead? - 15 so far.
they're still pulling bodies out of the water.
any survivors? - Two.
one guy's in County hospital, but he's in a coma.
the DA has a second guy, a cripple from New York.
the chief wants this place sealed off.
if you have any questions, give him a call.
this is Dave Kujan. I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.
if you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin of the San Pedro Police Department...
...at extension 112. Have a nice day.
why can't I see him? - I told you...
...the DA came down here last night ready to arraign...
...even before they moved him to County.
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...
...the DA comes out looking like the bogeyman smacked him around.
they take his statement, and they cut him a deal.
did they charge him with anything? - Weapons, misdemeanor.
what is that?
I give the DA credit for getting that much, you understand?
excuse me, sir.
this whole thing has turned political. The mayor was here last night.
the chief. This morning, the governor called, okay?
I'm telling you, this guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.
take my word for it. - When does he post bail?
maybe two hours, tops. - I want to see him.
no. - I gotta see him.
no. I can't-- - You gotta do this for me.
I came a long way for this.
Dave, please.
even if I let you talk to him, he won't talk to you.
he's paranoid about being recorded.
he knows the rooms are wired. - I quit.
this won't be an interrogation, just a friendly chat.
he won't go into the interrogation room. - Then someplace else.
where?
no, no.
if this was a dope deal, where's the dope? If it was a hit, who called it?
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories to answer all these questions.
you know what I think. - That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.
the guy's got total immunity. His story checks out.
he doesn't know what you want to know. - I don't think he does, not exactly.
but there's a lot more to his story, believe me.
I wanna know why 27 men died on that pier...
...for what looks to be $91 million worth of dope that wasn't there.
and above all, I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.
he's dead.
come on. Two hours. Just till he makes bail.
they're all dead.
I don't care how tough you say Keaton was...
...nobody on that boat could've come out alive.
is he talking? - He regained consciousness an hour ago.
he spoke, not English, then he lapsed.
Hungarian? - That might have been it.
most of them were Hungarians. - You gotta put this on.
burn victims are very susceptible to infection.
and, of course, there's no smoking.
keep your mask up. Please don't touch him.
is he gonna die?
he's burned 60 percent of his body, broken ribs
call security. Put a man on the door.
is he dangerous? - Yes.
do it.
do it now.
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.
look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.
Yes, I'm sure.
no, he's all fucked up.
I can't hear you.
will you shut up? I'm on the phone.
Yes.
no, not till I put a man on him.
send me someone who can speak Hungarian.
he's awake. He's talking like a Thai hooker.
what? - Keyser Soze!
no shit?
call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.
verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.
nice to meet you.
he wants to ask you a few questions before you go.
what about? - About a Dean Keaton, mostly.
I'd like to start at the lineup back in New York.
can I get some coffee? - In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.
I'm really thirsty. I used to dehydrate as a kid.
once I got so bad my piss come out like snot.
it was all thick and gooey-- - I'll get your fucking coffee.
get me one, too, while you're at it.
that guy is tense.
tension is a killer.
I used to be in a barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
the baritone was this guy named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.
like, orca fat. He was so stressed in the morning
you know we're trying to help you. - Sure, and I appreciate that.
and I wanna help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops.
I would've liked to have been a fed, but my CP
you're not tellin' us everything. I know you know something.
I told the DA everything I know.
I know you like Keaton.
I know you think he's a good man. - I know he was good.
he was a corrupt cop.
sure. 15 years ago, but he was a good thief.
the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.
are you trying to get a rise out of me?
I just wanna hear your story. - It's all there.
may I have a cigarette?
according to your statement-- - I need a light.
according to your statement, you're a short-con operator...
...run-of-the-mill
according to your statement, you're a short-con operator...
...run-of-the-mill scams.
it's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
I know. Sweet deal you have here. Total immunity.
I do have the weapons charge. I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.
you know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?
you know a religious guy named John Paul?
you know Ruby's in Attica? - He didn't have my lawyer.
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.
he's a good friend of mine, likes me very much.
I know your testimony is sealed. Ruby's well connected.
he's got lots of friends inside who do favors for him.
what would he say if he found out you dropped his name to the DA?
there's nothing there on Ruby. - I'll be sure to mention that to him.
know what I've learned on the job? How to spot a murderer.
say you arrest three guys for the same killing.
put them in jail overnight.
next morning, whoever's sleeping is your man.
if you're guilty, you know you're caught. You let your guard down.
you follow me? - No.
let me get to the point.
I'm smarter than you, and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.
I'm not a rat.
Thanks.
when I was pickin' beans in Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee.
right off the trees, I mean. That was good.
this is shit, but I'm in a police station. - Can we get started again?
what happened after the lineup?
the desk sergeant was telling me he couldn't release you.
can you believe that? You weren't even charged.
damn police.
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.
I'll take them to the DA tomorrow. - Forget about it.
I'll have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
I don't want to talk about it, okay?
what did Fortier and Renault say?
they asked for more time to think about investing.
damn it.
more time for what?
no matter how you cover my tracks they're still gonna find out about me.
give me some credit.
I got you this far. Let's go to the grand jury.
this isn't gonna stop if we don't-- - It's never going to stop, period.
by next week, every investor in the city is gonna be walking away from us.
it's finished.
I'm finished.
don't give up on me now.
it's never gonna stop.
I love you.
they ruined me in there tonight.
I love you.
do you hear me?
what?
all right.
let's just go to my place.
we'll worry about this tomorrow.
let's go.
Fenster and McManus had a cagey proposition:
a fast-jump, high-risk, long money.
we all knew it could be done.
the way I figured, to do it wrong meant killing.
to do it right took five men.
five men meant Keaton.
Keaton took convincing.
new York's finest taxi service.
bullshit.
bullshit.
they don't operate anymore.
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct. They're coming out for one job, Thursday.
they're pickin' up a guy smuggling emeralds from South America.
McManus already has a fence set up.
a fence? Who? - Some guy in California called Redfoot.
I never heard of him. - You have to come.
what's it to you whether I do it or not? - They don't know me. You do.
they won't take me unless you go.
look at me. I need this.
you're telling me you don't need this? Is this your place?
I'm not knocking you. You got a good scam going with this lawyer.
sorry.
it's okay.
you say it's the real thing? That's cool.
you okay?
I was out of line.
but they're never gonna stop with us. You know that.
as clean as you get, they'll never let you go now.
this way, we hit the cops where it hurts, and we get well in the meantime.
you sure you're okay?
I'll be all right.
look, I...
...sometimes get-- - Forget it.
I'll probably shit blood tonight.
so...
...how do they wanna do it?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I say no.
Fenster? Hockney?
they're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything.
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.
but like I say, they won't let me in without you.
$3 million?
maybe more.
no killing.
not if we do it my way.
new York's finest taxi service was not your normal taxi service.
it was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD that ran a high-profit racket...
...driving smugglers and drug dealers all over the city.
for $300 a mile, you got your own blue and white...
...and a police escort. They even had their own business cards.
after a while, somebody started asking questions, and the taxi service shut down.
ever since then, Internal Affairs has been waiting to catch them in the act.
that's where we came in.
so, how was the flight? - Fuckin' great.
will this get me to Staten Island?
are you kiddin' me? This will get you to Cape Cod.
McManus came to us with the job. Fenster got the vans.
hockney supplied the hardware.
I came through with how to do it so no one got killed.
but Keaton? Keaton put on the finishing touch.
a little "fuck you" from the five of us to the NYPD.
watch this.
careful.
come on, asshole!
holy shit!
don't move, you fucker! - Drop it now, motherfucker!
drop the fuckin' gun! Drop it!
don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.
what do you guys want? - Put your fuckin' thing away.
we're cops! Stupid assholes!
watch the glass! - Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!
you want a buckshot shampoo, chubby? - Shut up!
fuck.
afternoon, my little pork chops. Give me the shit.
don't move! - Give him the shit!
give him the fuckin' thing!
give him the fuckin' shit, man!
hurry up! Come on!
now the money! - There's no money.
give me the money now! - There's no fuckin' money.
give him the fuckin' money!
do it! Give him the money! - Give me the money!
give him the money! - Hurry up!
you know who the fuck I am?
you people know who the fuck I am? Fuck!
we do now, jerk-off.
cocksucker.
wait a minute. What's that?
what the fuck?
holy shit!
go!
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.
the press was on the scene before the police were.
Strausz and Rizzi were indicted three days later.
within a few weeks, 50 more cops went down with them.
everybody got it right in the ass, from the chief on down.
it was beautiful.
I owe you $2. 50.
Dr. Keaton.
there's more here than I thought. - When's the fence coming?
Redfoot never comes to see me. I always go to see him.
in California?
Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I
wait, hold the fuckin' phone. You and Fenster? No.
you fuckin' kiddin' me? - So then, who's gonna go?
we all go.
what's your fuckin' problem, man?
my problem, is you and Fenster honeymooning in California...
...while the rest of us are sittin' here holding our dicks.
the job's over.
cool it.
la's a good place to lay low for a while.
you wanna dance?
ladies.
I would like to propose a toast.
there you go.
to Mr. Verbal...
...the man with the plan.
we're gonna miss the flight.
don't do this. Send her a note. Something.
I said we'll make it.
we're gonna miss the plane.
she'll understand.
that's heartwarming. Really.
I'm weepy.
you wanna wait outside?
you guys wanted to know what happened. I'm telling you.
come on, Verbal.
who do you think you're talkin' to? You expect me to believe that he retired?
for a woman?
bullshit. Keaton was using her.
he loved her. - Sure.
I'm supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea.
it was all Fenster and McManus. - Keaton was a cop for four years.
who else would know better?
that job had his name on it. - Edie had him turned around.
let me tell you something.
I know Dean Keaton.
I've been investigating him for the past three years.
the guy I know was a cold-blooded bastard.
iad indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force.
don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold.
you got him all wrong.
do I?
Dean Keaton was under indictment seven times while he was on the force.
in every case, witnesses either reversed their testimony...
...or died before they could testify.
when they finally did nail him for fraud, he spent five years in Sing Sing.
he killed three prisoners inside.
of course, I can't prove this...
...but I can't prove the best part either.
Dean Keaton was dead.
did you know that?
he died in a fire two years ago, during an investigation into the murder...
...of a witness who was going to testify against him.
two people saw Dean Keaton walk into a warehouse he owned...just before it blew up.
they said he went in to check a leaking gas main.
it blew up and took all of Dean Keaton with it.
within three months of the explosion, the two witnesses, they were dead.
one killed himself in his car.
the other fell down an open elevator shaft.
let's get this show on the road.
this is not what we discussed. There are too many
I promise we'll be out before he blows his porch light.
I have a noon meeting. - Five minutes.
everyone calm down, all right?
I want you to ask this man about the shootout in the harbor.
he says they were buying-- - Dope. We know.
he doesn't know what they were buying, but not dope.
people. - What?
he needs guarantees...
what is he talking about, guarantees? - He says his life is in danger.
he saw the Devil. Looked him in the eye.
I'm on my way. - No, wait a minute.
ask him to tell him what he told me...
...about the Devil.
who's the Devil?
he was in the harbor, killing many men.
he saw Keyser Soze?
he saw his face. - All right.
tell him to tell her what he looks like.
describe him.
six weeks ago, I get an anonymous phone call...
...telling me I can find Keaton eating at Mondino's, and there he is.
because he never profited from his alleged death...
...and we convicted someone else of the murder we tried to pin on him...
...we had to let him go.
he was dead just long enough for the murder rap to blow over.
and then he had lunch.
I don't know about that.
I don't think you do, but you say you saw Keaton die.
I think you're covering his ass, and he's still out there.
I think he's behind that circus at the harbor.
my bet is he's using you because you're stupid and think he's your friend.
you tell me he's dead, so be it.
I wanna be sure before I go back to New York.
he wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
what lawyer?
what lawyer?
back when I was in that barbershop quartet
you don't think I know you held out on the DA?
what did you leave out?
I could be on the phone to Ruby in 10 minutes.
the DA gave me immunity. - Not from me.
you get no immunity from me, you piece of shit.
every criminal I have put in prison, every cop that owes me a favor...
...every creep and scumbag that walks the street...
...will know the name of Verbal Kint. You talk to me...
...or that precious immunity they grant you...
...won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on.
there was a lawyer.
Kobayashi.
is he the one that killed Keaton? - No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.
convince me.
tell me every last detail.
we arrived in Los Angeles and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.
he had a good reputation. Seemed like a good guy.
still, we should have known better. - How you doing?
good. You? - Not bad. Can't complain.
how's it going, Fenster?
don't need to open it, right?
you must be Keaton.
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.
Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint. - Verbal, the man with the plan.
you interested in more work?
we're always looking for extra work. - We're on vacation.
that's too bad.
I got a ton of work and no good people.
not like you guys. - What's the job?
there's this jeweler out of Texas named Saul.
he rents a suite in some downtown hotel.
he does free appraisals. Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.
the word is, he carries around a lot of cash.
so I figure, I keep the merchandise, you keep the green.
simple. - What about security?
a couple of bodyguards. Nothing you couldn't handle.
give me time to check it out?
I expect nothing less from you, man.
good to see you. We'll call you.
enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.
a friend in New York tells me that you knew Spook Hollis.
the way I hear it, you did time with ol' Spook.
a good man, wasn't he?
I used to run dope for him.
too bad he got shivved.
I shivved him.
better you hear it from me now than from somebody else later.
I appreciate that.
but just out of curiosity...
...was it business or personal?
a bit of both.
like I said...
...you give me a call if you're interested.
is there a problem?
one job.
that was the deal.
one job?
one job?
that's a good one.
Keaton fought it as best he could, but a man can't change what he is.
he can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself.
it took one day with McManus nagging, and we went back to work.
I get out of my car, and the thing is wrecked.
I look in the backseat of the other car, and this woman's totally naked.
I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe. - Get in the car, Saul.
freeze, motherfucker! - Stay right there!
gimme the case. Give me the fuckin' case!
give me the fuckin' case. I'm tellin' you for the last time.
give me the fuckin' case!
come on! - Don't move!
hand over the case.
hand over the fuckin' case.
come on, let's go!
come on! - Bad day. Fuck it.
let's go!
fuck.
looks like a lot of china to me. - Shit.
guys, come on.
what are you doin'? - I'm gonna kill him.
we did it your way, now we'll do it mine.
you gonna kill him? - I'll deal with him.
you'd better, or I'm gonna. - Shut up.
what am I supposed to do with that?
feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain. I don't know what that is.
what do you mean? - I don't know.
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.
who?
I don't know. Some limey.
he's a middleman for somebody. He doesn't say, I don't ask.
you're fuckin' full of shit! - Fuck you.
fuck you. - Listen to me.
we wanna meet him, okay?
that's funny.
he called me last night. He says he wants to meet you guys.
okay, we'll meet him.
I'll call you. - Good. Let's go.
I don't like it. Wait a minute. One more thing, tough guy:
any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.
you're such a tough guy. But do me a favor, all right?
get the fuck off my dick.
No!
put a leash on that puppy.
it's an awful shame about Saul gettin' whacked.
cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.
sooner or later, they're gonna come around askin' me.
you have a sweet night, ladies.
fuck you.
so this lawyer-- - Kobayashi.
came from Redfoot. - Right.
and why leave this out when you talked to the DA?
Dave, someone to see you.
I've been looking all over for you.
you still after that coke that took a walk out of that bloodbath yesterday?
you can stop looking. There was no coke.
I've been in LA County talking to a guy they pulled out of a drainpipe...
...yesterday after the shootout.
he came to this morning, he started talking.
he's part of a Hungarian mob. They dealt with gwats from Argentina.
he says it was definitely not a dope deal.
but there were-- - We know. But he says no on the dope.
this Hungarian tells me they were pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.
they had no time for that kind of product, and no means to move it.
what's the money for? - He didn't know.
no one doing the deal knew except for a few key people.
they were all very hush about it, he says.
whatever it was, it was very sensitive. - I don't get it.
you got the cripple in there from New York?
did he mention Keyser Soze?
who?
just bear with me here.
who's Keyser Soze? - Fuck!
we've been goin' over this for an hour and a half.
what we need to do is find Redfoot and get the hell out of here now.
what we need to do is think.
think back.
somebody with power...
...somebody capable of tracking us from New York to LA.
what the hell are we doing here? - We're waiting.
sit down. - No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.
Mr. Hockney, do stay.
Mr. Keaton.
Mr. Fenster I recognize from his mug shots...
...as well as Mr. McManus.
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint, the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.
my employer sends his gratitude, a most unexpected benefit.
I am Mr. Kobayashi.
I have been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.
what do you want? - My employer requires your services.
one job, one day's work. Very dangerous.
he does not expect all of you to live. But those of you who do...
...will have $91 million to divide between you in any way you see fit.
who's your boss?
I work for Keyser Soze.
who's Keyser Soze?
judging by the sudden change in mood...
...I feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you.
I come with an offer directly from Mr. Soze.
an order, actually. - What do you mean, "an order"?
in 1981, you participated in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York.
the cargo was raw steel, steel which belonged to Mr. Soze...
...and which was destined for Pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor.
a most profitable violation of UN Regulations.
you had no way of knowing this...
...because the fellow shipping the steel was working for Soze...
...without his knowledge.
earlier this year, Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus...
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight out of Newark airport.
the plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring also set for Pakistan.
two months ago, Mr. Hockney stole a truck...
...carrying gun parts through Queens.
gun parts which were set to be destroyed by the state of New York.
they were to be lost in a way station and rerouted to Belfast.
again, Mr. Soze using pawns who had no knowledge.
which brings us to Mr. Kint.
nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's...
...less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence scam...
...By a cripple.
he was relieved of $62, 000.
now, it has taken us some time to find you.
our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in New York.
you set up the lineup.
Yes. You were not to be released until I had come to see you.
it seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Miss Finneran...
...was a little too effective in expediting his release.
holding the rest of you became a moot point.
what about Redfoot? - Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.
Mr. Soze rarely works with the same people for long...
...and they never know who they're working for.
one cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
so, why are you telling us?
because you have stolen from Mr. Soze, Mr. Fenster.
all of you.
that you did not know it is the only reason you're still alive.
he feels you owe him. You will repay your debt.
fuck the debt, and fuck you. How do we know you work for Soze?
I don't think that is very relevant.
all five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg...
...and his bodyguards.
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your involvement.
what's your point? - The offer is this, gentlemen:
Mr. Soze's primary interest...
...is narcotics.
he has been competing, shall we say...with a group of Argentineans for several years.
competing with Mr. Soze has taken its toll.
these Argentineans are negotiating the sale...
...of $91 million in cocaine in three days time.
needless to say, this purchase will revitalize...the diminishing strength of their organization.
Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal.
if you choose, you may wait until after the buy.
whatever money changes hands is yours.
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.
and then you will be free of your obligations to Mr. Soze.
give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.
a gift from Mr. Soze.
good day, gentlemen.
they got my whole life in here, everything I've done since I was 18.
they fuckin' know everything.
everybody I've ever worked with or did time with.
no.
this isn't right. - I don't know.
who's that guy who used to talk about Soze in New York?
bricks Marlin. - He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.
he said he always made five times more money on it than the job was worth.
this guy's a pipe dream.
Kobayashi's using him for window dressing.
I don't know. This is bad.
it's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD. It's a fuckin' setup.
the way I hear it, Soze's some kind of butcher.
a peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher. - There is no Keyser Soze!
who is Keyser Soze?
he's supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German.
nobody ever believed he was real.
nobody knew him or saw anybody that ever worked directly for him.
to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Soze.
you never knew. That was his power.
the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...was convincing the world he didn't exist.
one story the guys told me, the story I believe ...was from his days in Turkey.
there was a gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob.
they realized that to be in power, you didn't need guns...
...or money or even numbers.
you just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't.
after a while they come into power, and then they come after Soze.
he was small-time then. Just running dope, they say.
they come to his home...in the afternoon looking for his business.
they find his wife and kids in the house, and decide to wait for Soze.
he comes home to find his wife raped and children screaming.
the Hungarians knew Soze was tough, not to be trifled with.
they let him know they meant business.
No!
they tell him they want his territory, all his business.
Soze looks over the faces of his family.
then he showed these men of will what will really was.
he tells them he would rather see his family dead...
...than live another day after this.
he lets the last Hungarian go...
...waits until his family is in the ground, and goes after the rest of the mob.
he kills their kids, he kills their wives...
...he kills their parents and their friends.
he burns down the houses they live in...
...and the stores they work in.
he kills people that owe them money. And like that...
...he's gone, underground.
nobody's ever seen him since. He becomes a myth.
a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night.
rat on your pop, and Keyser Soze will get you.
no one ever really believes.
do you believe in him?
Keaton always said:
I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.
I believe in God.
and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.
you give any weight to this?
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser from Justice.
he's got a file on Soze in DC. It's been a hobby of his for a while.
a lot of guys equate him to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.
you've heard of him?
where? On the street?
a few times. You know, outside stuff.
someone working for a guy who worked for a guy who got money from Soze.
shit like that.
it could be an old badge. A hex sign.
keep people from fucking with you when a name meant something.
but you're here. - Shit, yeah.
this guy's trying to walk out of a hospital because he's so afraid of Soze.
I'll run it up the flagpole.
I came clean. I told it like it happened.
so what about how I got there?
it's so full of holes, the DA would've told me to forget amnesty.
you got what you wanted out of me. Big deal.
that's why you never told the DA? - You tell me.
if I told you the Loch Ness monster hired me, what would you say?
turn state's evidence. We'll put you on the stand.
I've got immunity. What can you possibly offer me?
if there really is a Keyser Soze, he's gonna come lookin' for you.
Where's your head?
where do you think the pressure is?
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him, knows where I am right now.
he has the burner on your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.
immunity was just a deal with you assholes.
I got a new problem when I post bail.
why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion.
pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.
the same fuckers that rounded us up are now bailing me out?
fuck you.
you think you can catch Keyser Soze?
you think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught...and sticks his head out?
if he comes up for anything, it'll be to get rid of me.
after that...
...my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
what happened next?
we woke up the next morning and Fenster was gone.
he couldn't handle the idea of slumming for Soze.
he left us a note wishing us good luck...
...and took a chunk of the money we'd scraped together.
then what?
McManus was furious.
he talked about tracking him down and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.
that night, we got the call.
what call?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
let's get the fuck out of here.
we gotta bury him.
with what?
with our hands.
this is nuts.
it's dry fucking sand.
when he rots the surfers are gonna smell him a mile away.
dig, you fuck. - What are we gonna do?
this fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.
I don't know about you, peg leg, but I can run. I got no problem with that.
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either.
you run, and we're gonna be diggin' a hole for you.
you got that?
this ain't my boy we're burying. I don't owe anybody!
so fuck you. - He was my partner for five years.
we did more jobs and I saw more money than you can ever count.
so fuck you!
cause now it's payback! - It's not payback!
it's precaution.
you want payback? You wanna run? I don't care.
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.
I'm not doin' it for you.
I'm doin' this for me.
I'm gonna finish this thing.
this Kobayashi bastard is not gonna stand on me.
after they killed Fenster, nobody would run?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it. - Why didn't you say anything?
believe me, I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.
it was too far-fetched for him.
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.
to a cop, the explanation is never that complicated.
it's always simple.
there's no mystery to the street, no arch-criminal.
you got a body and think his brother did it, you're probably right.
nobody argued with Keaton.
they just set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.
they're coming up.
did you hear me? He's coming up. - He's on his way down.
don't move.
press 20. Do it now.
move.
the answer is "no." - Mr. Soze will be most
listen, cocksucker, there is no Keyser Soze.
mention his name again, I'll kill you right now.
a strange threat. I assume you've come here to kill me anyway.
we know that you can get to us...
...but now you know that we can get to you.
I'm giving you one last chance to call this off.
my employer has made up his mind.
he does not change it. - Neither do we.
you got Fenster, but you won't be able to get all of us.
not before one of us gets through to you.
I believe you. I most sincerely do.
you would not have been chosen were you not so suitable.
but I cannot make this decision. Whatever you threaten me with is...
...ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me...
...if I do not carry out my orders in full.
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.
I just wanted you to know that.
I'm so sorry.
I implore you, believe me...
...Mr. Soze is very real...
...and very determined. - We'll see.
before you do me in...
...you will let me finish my business with Miss Finneran first, won't you?
what did you say?
Edie Finneran.
she's upstairs in my office...
...for an extradition deposition.
I requested she be put on the case personally.
she flew in yesterday.
no matter.
kill away.
you're lying.
am I?
miss Finneran's escort while she's here in Los Angeles.
never leaves her for a moment.
I thought you'd be glad to know she's in good hands.
get some rest. The boat will be ready for you on Friday.
if I see you or any of your friends before then...
...Miss Finneran will be the victim of a most gruesome violation before she dies.
as indeed will your father, Mr. Hockney...
...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint.
I might only castrate Mr. McManus' nephew, David.
do I make myself clear?
we will take care of the two bodies downstairs.
we'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster.
if you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
it's a logistical nightmare.
close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.
there's no tellin' how many more are gonna be below deck.
can we stealth these guys?
with all that coke, they're gonna be ready.
which brings me to sunny point Number 2.
even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.
what if we wait for the money?
ten more men at least.
in my opinion, it can't be done.
anyone who goes in is not comin' out alive.
I'm gonna wait for the money. - Me, too.
did you hear what he just said? - If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.
me, too.
there's nothing that can't be done.
I just can't believe we're gonna walk in to certain death.
the news said it's raining in New York.
what language is that?
I don't know. Russian, I think.
Hungarian?
the package has arrived, gentlemen.
you kids ready?
I would be if I didn't have to stop and answer you.
I'm ready.
McManus, you better be set up in 10 seconds.
I'm ready.
I want you to stay here.
I'm supposed to cover
if we don't get out of this, take the money and go.
I can't
find Edie. Tell her everything that happened.
she knows people. She knows what to do.
if I don't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
what if I-- - Just do what I say.
please.
tell her that...
tell her I tried.
McManus, he's on his way.
I'm there.
one, two, three, four...
...five, six, seven...
Oswald was a fag.
Hi.
how you doin'?
is there a problem?
now.
old McDonald had a farm "Ee-aye, ee-aye, O "And on that farm, he shot some guys
Elvis has left the building.
hold fire. Hold fire. Vamonos!
hello.
why didn't you run?
I froze up.
I thought about Fenster and how he looked when we buried him.
then I thought about Keaton, and it looked like he might pull it off.
a boy found a body on the beach today.
thrown clear of the boat. Shot twice in the head.
two guys from the Bureau identified him.
what else? - His name was Arturo Marquez.
a petty smuggler from Argentina.
he was arrested last year in New York for trafficking.
he escapes to California. They pick him up in Long Beach.
they're setting up extradition, he escapes again.
now, get this.
Edie Finneran's brought in to advise on the proceedings.
new York faxed me a copy of his testimony.
he was a rat. - A big fucking rat.
Arturo was very opposed to returning to prison.
so much so, that he named close to 50 people.
guess who he named in the finale.
there's more.
I'll tell you what I know. Stop me when this sounds familiar.
there was no dope on that boat.
you, stay quiet.
he's here.
I know he's here. That's him. I'm telling you, that's him.
I know he's here!
you can't understand. That's him. - Shut up.
that's him. You hear me? I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!
Where's Hockney? - I don't know.
there's no coke.
what? - You heard me, dumb fuck.
there's no coke! - What the fuck? No coke?
I've been up and down in every fucking room.
there's gotta be coke! - There is nothing!
nothing!
don't you fuck with me.
there is no fucking coke!
I'm out of here.
I told them nothing.
I swear.
I told them nothing. Please.
what the fuck is goin' on?
the strangest thing.
that's what you said. You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.
wait a minute.
are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?
you said you didn't know who it was. - I know there was dope on that boat.
stop stallin'. - I'm not.
you know what I'm getting at. - Get out of my face.
I got immunity. I don't have to take this.
you know what I'm getting at.
I don't know what you're talking about. - The truth!
try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.
I did.
you're lying to me.
you've known this whole time. - I don't know what you're saying.
I did see Keaton get shot. I swear to you.
why didn't you help him? You had a gun.
he was your friend.
because I was afraid.
afraid. - Afraid of what?
afraid of-- - I knew it was Keyser Soze.
it was Keyser Soze, I mean, the Devil himself.
how do you shoot the Devil in the back?
what if you miss?
let's get back to the pier.
Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him? - What? No.
he was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department.
he swore out a statement to federal marshals...
...saying that he had seen and could positively identify one...
it says right here in the report.
he had intimate knowledge of his businesses, including...
...but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I never heard of him.
his own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians.
most likely the same Hungarians that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.
the money wasn't there for dope.
the Hungarians were going to buy the one guy...
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.
I said I never heard of him. - But Keaton did.
Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition advisor.
she knew who he was and what he knew.
there were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit.
a suicide mission to whack out the one guy...
...that could finger Keyser Soze.
so Soze put some thieves to it...
...men he knew he could march into certain death.
you're saying Soze sent us to kill someone?
I'm saying Keaton did. He left you behind for a reason.
just do what I tell you.
if you all knew that Soze could find you anywhere...
...why did he give you the money to run?
he could have used you on the boat. - He wanted me to live.
a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world...
...finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple?
no, sir. Why?
Edie.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute.
even if I did...
...I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her.
so why?
because he was my friend.
no, he wasn't your friend. Keaton didn't have friends.
what are you doing here?
he saved you because he wanted it that way.
it was his will.
Keaton was Keyser Soze. - No.
a man who could wrangle the wills of men like Hockney and McManus.
a man who could engineer a police lineup...through all his years of contacts in NYPD.
the kind of man who could've killed Edie Finneran.
she was found yesterday at a hotel in Pennsylvania...
...shot twice in the head.
what do you think about Keaton now?
Edie?
he used all of you to get him on that boat.
he couldn't get on alone. He had to pull the trigger himself...
...to make sure he got his man...
...the one man that could identify him.
this is all bullshit.
you said you saw him die.
or did you?
you had to hide when you heard the police cars.
you said you heard the shot before the fire...
...but you didn't see him die.
I knew him. He would never-- - He programmed you.
he programmed you to tell us what he wanted you to.
he knew we were close. You said it yourself.
where was the political pressure to protect you from?
it was Keaton.
immunity was your reward. - But why me?
why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?
why me? I'm stupid. I'm a cripple. Why me?
because you're a cripple.
because you're stupid.
because you're weaker than them.
if he's dead...
if what you say is true, then it won't matter.
it was his idea to hit the taxi service, wasn't it?
come on, tell me the truth. - It was all Keaton.
we followed him from the beginning.
I didn't know.
I saw him die.
I believe he's dead. Christ.
you're not safe on your own.
you think he's...
I don't know.
Keyser Soze's a shield, or like you said, a spook story.
but I know Keaton, and someone is out there pulling strings for you.
stay here and let us protect you. - I'm not bait. I post today.
you posted 20 minutes ago.
capt. Leo wants you out of here.
unless you turn state's. - I'll take my chances.
if someone wants to get you, they're gonna get you out there.
turn state's evidence. You might never see trial.
maybe so.
but I'm not a rat.
fuckin' cops.
excuse me, can I use your fax machine?
you'll have to sign for these, Mr. Kint.
one watch, gold.
one cigarette lighter, gold.
one pack of cigarettes. Thank you.
we still got nothing.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
which is nothing.
no matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...
...if Keaton is alive, he's not comin' up again.
I'll find him.
waste of time.
a rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.
what?
nothing.
man, you're a slob.
but it all has a system.
it all makes sense if you look at it right. You gotta stand back from it.
you wanna see a real horror show? See my garage.
convince me. Tell me every last...
when I was in that barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...
Where's your head? - We need to think, think back.
I'm sure you've heard tall tales.
bricks Marlin. - This isn't right.
I just wanna hear your story. - It's all there.
I'm tellin' it straight. - Some guy in California called Redfoot.
a gift from Mr. Soze. - Talk to me.
what about Redfoot? - Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.
using pawns... - A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.
there was a lawyer...
Kobayashi...
when I was picking beans in Guatemala we made fresh coffee.
I know you thought he was a good man. - I know he was good.
you tell me every last detail. - The strangest thing.
how do you shoot the Devil in the back?
this guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of...
what's your story, pretzel man?
there was a lawyer. - What lawyer?
I am Mr. Kobayashi.
Kobayashi. Kobayashi. - Tell me every last detail.
I work for Keyser Soze. - Convince me. Convince me.
every creep and scumbag that works the street...
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.
the cripple, did you see him?
the cripple! Which way did he go? - He went out that way.
I know you know something. I know you're not telling...
I'm smarter than you...
...and I'm gonna find out whether you like it or not.
to a cop, the explanation is never complicated.
it's always simple. - The truth!
there's no arch-criminal behind it all.
somebody with power, somebody who is capable...
you think a guy like that gets this close to getting caught...and sticks his head out?
because you're stupid. Because you're a cripple.
what I wanna know is, who's the gimp?
you've known the whole fuckin' time.
if he comes up for anything it'll be for me. I'm sure Keaton is dead.
I can't feel my legs, Keyser.
first thing I learned on the job. You know what?
how to spot a murderer. - You got the cripple in there?
did he mention Keyser Soze? - Who?
after that...
...my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...was convincing the world he didn't exist.
and like that...
...he's gone
I'm very sorry, sir, but there was nothing I could do.
dump that thing in the bushes! We're late already. Out of my way.
any spares? - No.
go on.
down there, under the hut.
hurry.
they got a bleeding generator grinding away.
lights on all over the place.
not expecting visitors, are they?
spread out. Take cover.
let's not wake them up.
you gonna use grenades, Captain?
may not be too easy. Might bounce against those screens.
Yeah. I suppose they might.
Scott. - Sir?
do you think, I mean, given a chance that you could operate the kind of transmitter they've got in there?
I'll have to have a look at it, but it's probably basically the same thing.
good. I think we might give it a try.
give what a try?
if the three of us could get in there unnoticed...
I could dispose of him...
and you two could send back our fake message on their transmitter.
rather a nice touch of irony, don't you think?
What're you trying to pull, Captain? That wasn't in our orders.
no, Lieutenant. It's evident that one of us has to get in there in any case to make sure of destroying their transmitter.
so why not go the whole hog?
our orders were damn plain, Captain.
we were to send the message on our transmitter.
if that didn't work out, we were to destroy theirs.
but nobody said a damn thing...
do be quiet. I'm going over there to deal with the operator.
when you see me come back to the window, you and Scott will join me.
we'll send our message, destroy their transmitter, and leave.
is that clear? - Yes, sir.
no, sir. I'm having no part of it, Captain.
you're disobeying orders and going beyond your authority.
you'll do as you're told.
what about that sentry, sir?
keep him covered, but don't shoot unless he does.
not even if he sees me. - Even if he sees you?
I'm going to walk straight across there.
even if he does see me, he's quite likely to assume I'm one of his chaps.
sir. - What is it?
you'd look a lot less English without that hat on.
captain! I'm telling you now.
you're going against Col. Thompson's orders.
if you go in there, I'm not going with you.
you hear me?
I haven't got time to argue, Lieutenant.
you know what you have to do.
there he is.
what's the matter?
you heard me tell him I'm not going in there.
we're running out of time.
what's the matter with you?
I told him.
come on, Scott. Let's go!
are you ready to transmit yet? - I think so, sir.
where the devil's the Lieutenant? - I don't know, sir.
Lawson!
I told him.
I know you did.
but they're in there now, waiting for you.
go on, get moving!
come on, move!
Where's the Lieutenant?
how the hell should I know? I haven't seen him. Have you?
of course I haven't.
then let's go.
I don't know.
you can please yourself, what you do. I'm off.
I'm not waiting around for that rubbish sack.
coming in, Hearne.
What're you doing? You're supposed to be gone three minutes ago.
Yes, sir. I was only waiting for you because I thought you...
blimey.
this is a turn-up for the book.
Oh, God, looks like the whole Japanese Air Force out there.
look at that.
like the swing shift at Lockheed.
I don't believe it.
three rousing, great cheers for American Air Reconnaissance.
let's get the hell out of here. Come on.
get me out of here!
What're you stopping for?
which way? - To the right, go around.
come on. - Go around.
to the right, come on!
give us covering fire, Thornton.
what's that? - Scatter.
good afternoon, gentlemen.
this is Major Yamaguchi who has the pleasure of addressing you.
no doubt you are quite amazed to hear my voice.
in order to be sure that you are hearing me...
I was obliged to make this speech five times today.
but tomorrow, as we close in on you, you will hear only four such speeches.
on Saturday, if you have not already been killed or captured, only two.
captured?
if you look at your map, you will see that as you travel south towards your base, your situation is like that of water in a funnel.
what's he on about?
do you understand?
like water in a funnel.
no matter where you may now be, or which route you take, you will eventually wish to emerge at your base.
as the funnel narrows, as you get closer to home, we will have less and less area to cover in our search for you.
we have found your abandoned radio transmitter.
we know our air power in this area came as a surprise to you...
and you must communicate this information to your base.
but this will not happen.
within three days you will all be killed or captured.
there is, however, an alternative.
you should consider it carefully.
if you will all surrender now, just one week from today, by which time your plans and ours will be an open secret.
you will be released and allowed to return to your own base.
this offer is a reasonable one.
certainly you should consider it carefully.
but, remember, it must be all of you.
there can be no exceptions.
I shall speak to you again tomorrow, by which time...
I hope that good sense will have prevailed.
if you wish to take advantage of our offer...
you will fire a single shot as a signal.
up your khyber.
that is all. Good day, gentlemen.
and good day to you, you malignant yellow dwarf.
they must be right behind us.
if that amplification's strong enough, they could be a helluva long way.
what do you think, sir?
about what?
it seems like they're on to us.
do you think they mean what they're saying?
don't be bloody stupid.
he did say they'd treat us all right.
they'll chop your bloody head off.
since when have you been an expert?
what do you know about it, bigmouth?
a sight more than you do, pig face.
I saw what they did in the hospital in Singapore.
you were so busy running you never even saw a Jap, let alone what they did to our lads.
they won't take us to a rest camp now that we know where that airstrip is.
he's right.
damn right. Now let's get out of here. - Okay, come on.
all right, move out.
all right, get some sleep.
God, I'm tired.
got to sleep.
got to.
good morning, gentlemen.
this is Saturday.
and the funnel in which you are trapped is rapidly narrowing.
I anticipated that you'd accept my terms.
instead, you evidently marched throughout the day, and, perhaps, most of the night.
a remarkable effort.
your leader must be a man of great determination.
you have very little reason to be pleased with him.
because his stubborn determination has inspired me to alter the terms of our offer.
this offer now has a time limit.
you have until sundown to surrender.
after that, you will be killed on sight.
in war, one must take harsh measures.
I'm sorry if you do not like these new rules.
but the responsibility rests with your leader.
remember, you have only to fire a single shot.
but please remember also that any surrender must include all of you.
you understand? All of you.
I will give you a few minutes to consider your decision.
how about it now, Lieutenant?
what? Quit?
no way.
they're not getting their hands on me.
this time tomorrow, I'll be back at that camp.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
even the Jap said it was all your fault.
I think we should turn in.
what do you say, Thornton? - Look, mate...
I couldn't give a bugger about the Yank's reasons for wanting to carry on, because I happen to know they're half-baked anyway.
and if you want to believe that Jap, you can, but they're not gonna get me.
I'd sooner shoot you than trust them.
as a matter of fact, much sooner.
how do you know the Japs are lying?
what makes you think they're all that different from us?
that's right, kid, they're not.
that's why that Jap Major could be lying, just like I would.
you remain indecisive.
I am sorry.
perhaps when you have rested, you will feel different.
but the conditions remain the same.
you have until dusk to give yourselves up.
that is all.
I knew it. He wants to draw our fire and kill us all.
how do you know that's what he said?
wanna wait a couple of minutes? They'll be here.
in that case, now's the time to pack it in. - Watch it, darling.
they're coming.
clear that place. - Get down!
knife.
come on, let's get out of here.
get him out of there. Quick, damn it.
come on, you guys, give us a hand. - Get him out of there.
griffiths, get my pack. - Yes, sir.
McLean! - Yes, sir?
get behind him. Pick him up and get him up the hill.
come on.
move down.
he can't move. - Come on.
quick, hurry up.
come on, damn it.
move your ass! Come on!
move! - That's the way.
I'll lead them off up here.
that's the way.
day and night, service is on hand, sir.
come on, boys.
don't drop him now.
watch out for those man-eating trout.
easy.
you weigh a bleeding ton.
that's it.
easy, Thorny.
Tosh, my old buddy, how does it look back there?
it's not so bad.
you'll be all right.
what kind of nonsense is that, man?
I can feel where the scorching thing went in, and I can't feel where it came out.
Yeah, you are leaking a bit.
hold up!
that makes your eyes water, doesn't it?
is that tight enough? - Yeah.
right, now put your little pinkie on the knot. That's right.
very pretty. I'm ready for my coming-out ball.
you'll get "coming out" in a minute. Take your finger away when I say, "Go."
ready, steady, go.
there we are. I shouldn't worry about it.
no, you shouldn't, but maybe I should?
that bloody Yankee poonagger's not coming back.
that's all right.
Thornton's not going anywhere, are you, Jock?
no, I'm having my change of life.
can he walk? - Only on the water.
Yeah.
that's it then.
do you hear that, lads? If anyone's going mad...
we've either got to leave him here or turn ourselves in, right?
I already told you, nobody's turning it in.
what are you gonna do with him?
you can't bloody carry him back, can you?
you're so bloody clever, Hearne. What are you gonna do with him?
listen, you poxed-up Glaswegian queer!
it's bad enough sitting here full of bloody holes without listening to you open your ugly face!
knock it off.
I can hear you halfway down the trail.
what's the matter with you guys, anyway? - It's Thornton, sir.
he can't walk.
I was just saying we've either gotta leave him here or turn ourselves in.
now, suppose you let me worry about that?
meanwhile, you just rest your toes because we're leaving before dark.
back in a minute, Thorny. - Thanks, Tosh.
that blood's worth bottling.
look at that pair.
I see Snow White's found his first dwarf.
a right teddy bear's picnic this has turned out to be.
how long has Thornton got? - I don't know.
but he won't be here next week, that's for certain.
where are you going?
where are you off?
you know what that Yank's gonna do, don't you?
what? - He's not leaving you here alive.
he'd sooner kill you himself.
kill me? - Why shouldn't he?
all he cares about is getting back to the camp.
he doesn't give a bugger about you. I heard him say so.
go to hell.
the only thing to do to get you out of here safely to see you're looked after, is to turn ourselves in.
I'll go with McLean and Griffiths and talk to the Japs.
you try that and I'll shoot you myself.
don't be daft, man.
what else is there? - You cowardly pig.
you just want to save your own skin, you hear me?
now look here, Thornton.
for God's sake, man，can't you even leave a fellow in peace?
I'm sorry.
I really am.
I was only thinking of you.
come on, take a wee drop of water.
come on, now.
I'll hold it up for you. Come on, drink it now.
McLean! Quickly! Wake up!
wake up! Thornton's had it!
there's no telling what the Yank will do now.
what is it?
come on, wake up.
what's the matter? - Thornton's dead. Come on!
what about Tosh? - Leave him.
you can't leave Tosh.
once we get to the Japs, we'll all be all right. Him as well.
wake up!
wake up, you stupid bastard! Where the hell are they?
how the bloody hell do I know?
you're the one who's supposed to be on guard.
stupid, dirty bastards!
you going after them? - No, it's too late.
they're probably closer to the Japs than we are.
the only way they'll stay alive is by telling that Jap Major where we are.
come on, let's go.
good afternoon, gentlemen.
from what your comrades have told me, I may assume that you are now hearing me.
as you must know...
your comrades decided to try and save their lives by surrendering and informing us of your position.
but you escaped...
and so their fate is still in doubt.
their surrender is of little value unless you choose to join them.
if you will surrender before dark, I shall keep my word.
you will be well treated and released in only a few days.
the man, Campbell, did not merit such good treatment.
he was found to be carrying the personal effects of one of our officers...
our Communications Lieutenant, who has been missing since last Tuesday.
his body was discovered yesterday.
our Lieutenant was very popular with his men.
you would understand that there was little I could do to restrain them, even if I had wanted to.
it has been an incident in which none of us can take pride.
however, the real problem still remains.
you must decide what you want done with the two comrades...
who are still our prisoners.
it is for you to say if they shall live.
if you wish to stay alive, you must persuade your two friends to surrender. Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
you may talk to them.
lieutenant? Tosh?
it's me, McLean.
it's right, what the Major was saying. About Campbell, I mean.
they showed us the stuff he stole from the officer and how he chopped his finger off to get the ring.
there wasn't anything anyone could've done to stop them.
but we're all right.
it is necessary for you to persuade them.
I know we shouldn't have gone off with Campbell like we did.
and I know we shouldn't have told them where you were hiding...
but it was Campbell's idea, and we thought it was for the best.
listen, if you don't give yourselves up now, we'll be the ones who end up paying for it.
your Corporal is giving you excellent advice.
there is no longer a choice for any of you.
either you surrender and live or if you attempt to postpone the inevitable, then I shall withdraw my offer, and your two comrades will die tonight.
the decision is yours. You have until nightfall to decide.
please, Lieutenant, do like he says.
Tosh, please!
I couldn't care less what they do to those two.
whatever that Jap's gonna do, he's gonna do.
it's got nothing to do with what we're gonna do.
if you mean it ain't gonna make us surrender, I'm with you.
but if you think we're gonna try and get back to camp by tomorrow, you must be bloody mad.
that's exactly what we're gonna do.
we hit that clearing on the edge of that camp...
if there are two of us, we're gonna have twice as much a chance of getting through.
and, buddy boy...
you're going with me every step of the way.
listen, Lieutenant...
neither of us wants to get killed, right?
I've never believed any of the guff that Jap's been giving us, either.
I know once he lays his hands on us, he'll finish us off, no matter what he says.
so, up until now, the only way of staying alive was getting back to camp.
but now there's another way.
something that nobody else thought of.
nobody except me, that is.
what? - It's very simple.
we double back, head north for two or three hours, duck off the trail, sleep for a couple of days and we'll be laughing.
laughing? - Yeah, laughing.
because once the Jap dive bombers get stuck into the Yank ships Monday morning, the Jap Major won't be looking for us anymore.
right?
he couldn't care less where we are then.
we can just lie low for a couple of days, stroll back into camp, and nobody will say a dickie bird.
what's so bad about that?
I never asked those idiots to send me out here.
but if I ever get back, it'll be:
well done, Hearne.
jolly good show.
now you can piss off home, back to whatever dirty little hole you came from.
and what are they gonna do for you, Lieutenant?
make you the bloody President?
no.
getting ourselves killed isn't going to make any difference to anybody except us.
look, Yank...
the last thing that Jap Major is gonna be looking for is us heading north.
so what do you say?
you got any idea how many guys will get killed on those ships, if we haven't got the guts to try and stop them?
okay, so a couple of hundred Yanks will get the chop.
they shouldn't have joined, should they? - Hundreds?
thousands.
in any case, it's not the bloody Yanks you're worried about...
because if their chances depend on us getting back, they've just about had it in the first place.
no, what's got you jumping about like a frog with a bullet up its ass is old Fairy Feet Hornsby...
because you reckon you let him down.
and that's the one bloody time you've been right.
you did.
you might just as well have killed him yourself.
but getting us killed isn't gonna make up for that.
so Hornsby is your problem.
and those Yank sailors are your problem.
and if you wanna start playing bloody heroes, I've got another problem for you.
I'm not bloody well coming with you.
you forgot your problem.
me.
I told you before, one of us has gotta get back there alive.
and if you don't go with me, I'll have to leave you here.
dead.
understood?
understood.
just don't forget.
gentlemen, your time is up!
I shall give you 30 seconds.
if you do not give yourselves up, I shall be forced to execute your two comrades.
let me talk to him.
listen to me, Lieutenant, please.
you've gotta listen to me. They're gonna kill us.
just like they killed Campbell.
please, Lieutenant, don't let them do it.
do you really find it so easy to believe that I would shoot you?
keep going.
get up.
there's not much further to go.
how the hell would you know?
there can't be.
no more, thank you, sir.
thank you, sir.
get up, you limey son of a bitch, or I'll kick your head in!
get up.
good morning, again.
you must be very tired.
you have come a long way during the night.
a truly remarkable effort.
remarkable, but to very little purpose.
shut up, you slimy yellow nob.
you have moved fast, but we have moved faster.
you will find that you are now very near the open field that serves as a perimeter to your base.
but some of my men are already on that perimeter.
in short, you are now totally surrounded.
you are now at the very tip of the funnel I have talked about so often.
I can understand your determination, but to give up your lives for an objective which cannot be won is a foolish waste.
you have shown yourselves to be brave soldiers.
it shows us that you are intelligent ones also.
give yourselves up and live.
I assure you, the medals they give to dead heroes are made of brass.
all they do is add weight to your coffin.
you bloody idiot!
believe me...
your situation is truly hopeless.
all trails leading back into the jungle are under guard.
this means that you can no longer hide, you can no longer double back on your tracks.
what's that all about?
better get the Sergeant Major.
I shall give you three minutes during which time you will wish to confirm for yourselves that what I have said is true.
at the end of that time, you must either surrender or die.
you will fire a single shot to indicate that you have surrendered.
or my men will close in and kill.
stand to!
what is it? - Don't know what it is, Sergeant Major.
get Col. Thompson! Double!
get the Color Sergeant. - Yes, Sergeant Major.
what the hell is it?
what is it, Sergeant Major? - I don't know what it is.
I've sent for the old man.
you better man the weapon pits. - Right.
come on, let's have you fast now!
what do you think this is, Kensington Gardens? Come on!
get in with that gun! - Get in there.
make sure the men stay back, Sergeant.
you men know the drill!
keep back!
stay out of enemy range!
laid on!
morning, sir. - Morning, Sergeant Major.
everything in order? - Yes, sir.
mortars? - All weapon pits are manned, sir.
sounds like loudspeakers of some kind.
got any more bright suggestions?
my patience is growing very short.
he must think we've still got a chance.
who must? - Guchi.
why are they giving us three minutes?
why don't they just come and get us?
Yeah.
Why?
I don't know.
maybe they're spread too thin.
maybe they're afraid to come in, for fear of chasing us out in the open.
Yeah, and having to waste all those bullets to shoot us?
maybe.
but there's still two of us and one of us just might make it.
you now have only two and a half more minutes.
we could sure use some covering fire.
think your guys will be doing anything? - Yeah.
having breakfast.
we could use all the help we can get.
maybe if we fire that shot...
why waste a bullet? - What do you mean?
fire one shot and maybe we'll confuse the Japs a bit.
but if we could kill their Major, they wouldn't have anyone to tell them what to do.
they'd be running about all over the place.
might give us a head start.
and that little bastard's been asking for it for a long time, hasn't he?
this way.
two minutes.
you now have only one and a half more minutes, gentlemen.
stand them to, Sergeant. - All guns stand to!
the rest of you keep back! Out of enemy range!
it worked.
they've gone back.
don't forget to zigzag.
you zig, I'll zag.
look there!
there they are!
can you make out which ones they are?
lay down covering fire, Sergeant! Hurry!
give those men covering fire!
correct right, Sergeant!
three turns more right!
more left!
come on!
he's all right. - He's alive.
he's getting up. - He's alive!
cease fire!
all guns cease fire!
machine gunners, stand by to give us covering fire!
take it easy, lad.
were there any other survivors?
was it just the two of you?
who was that with you out there?
I said who was that with you out there?
out there...
he was a bloody hero.
he killed fifteen bleeding Japs single-handed.
killed fifteen?
thirty, if you like.
tonight.
hugh Grant stars in our reasonably-priced car and is the new Audi TT any good?
we find out by playing golf.
hello and welcome!
thank you for that!
thank you.
now
now as I'm sure you know...
as I'm sure you know，
James May is the slowest man in the entire world
by the time he sets off anywhere normally his hair has grown another inch.
so, plainly，
he was the ideal man to try and max the fastest car in the world.
Vlad the impaler" is back.
last year, the mighty Bugatti Veyron stared in our greatest Top Gear Challenge ever when it raced an air-plane across the continent.
in that film, Jeremy talked endlessly about the Veyron's ferocious power and its incredible top speed.
because he was on public road he had to stick to the speed limit.
Hahahaha.
but today, we're not just going to talk about it.
we are going to do it.
we're going to take the fastest production car in the world up to its top speed.
its top speed is 253 mph.
much faster than a formular 1 car.
and when you think that the Veyron has air-bags, air-conditioning, a stereo, a boot and all the other stuff F1 cars aren't burdened with.
you realize what an increadible machine this is!
the Veyron is about pushing the outside of the envelop
it's about doing things that people said just were not possible
this car is a sort of "Concord" moment.
getting cars to do 155 mph frankly isn't really very difficult.
the Veyron needs just a piffling 270 bhp to reach that speed.
but 253!
crikey!
the faster you go, the more Mother Nature tries to hold you back
so to do the next 100 mph the 100 mhp that takes you up to 250.
needs another 730 Bhp.
so what you end up with is a 16-cylinder engine with 4 turbo chargers producing 1001 horse power.
and a lot of heat.
that's why your car has 1 radiator and this car has 10.
the engineers really worried uncharted territory in this car.
here is an example, when they wanted to sort out the high speed dynamics
they went to the Sauber F1 Team and they said "If you don't mind awfully,can we use your wind tunnel or not?"
and they said "Terribly sorry, but we can't go up to those speeds
in fact, cracking 253 mph causes nighimare after nightmaire.
but Bugatti insists that this 850, 000 pound car can do it.
mind you, actually testing their bold claim is a bit of a palaver.
this is Ehra-Lessien
Volkswagon's maximum security test track in Germany
when it was built during the cold war
it was delibrately sited in a no fly zone near the east German border in order to stop prying eyes from seeing secret prototypes
it has over 16 miles of private track.
but the bit we are interested in is the main straight, which is a whopping 5. 5 miles long.
although it is technically a flat and level road.
you stand here, you can't actually see the other end and that's because it's following the curvature of the earth.
but even when you've sorted the venue you can't just jump in the car and go.
this is Germany, there are procedures to go through.
I like procedures.
you have to insert a special key into a slot by the door.
and when you do, the diffuser flaps close.
the rear spoiler retracts and the whole car hunkers down to became as slippery as possible
the telemetry box we're using to record the speed measures in kilometers an hours.
so the magic number we are looking for is 407
right, ladies and gentleman
here we go. I'm approaching the banking on the top of the circuit
I have to do this in 200 kph
that's about 120
round the banking and look for my acceleration point ,then give it the beans down the straight 200 kph, that's 120
to get the car settled fourth gear 5000 revs
looking for the exit where I bury it.
here we go!
the climb from 200 to 300 kph was over in just 9. 4 seconds
the world, viewers, is a total blur!
I'm already doing 330 Kph
going too quick, I can't do the math.
gettng up to about 350
captain Slow is doing 360 kph... 370
that's 230 miles per hour.
I was now leaving F1 cars behind
it's no wonder Micheal Schumacher retired.
he's slower than me!
at this sort of speed this engine is sucking in as much air in a minute as I breathe in four days
getting close to the maximum which means the tires would only last for about 15 minutes
but it's OK
because the fuel runs out in 12 minutes
this is a road car and I'm getting up to 404
405, come on!
come on， give me one more!
406!
come on， I need one more, one more!
I'm covering a football pitch every second
that I'm pretty confident that's as fast as I'm ever gonna go in a car.
increadible
that is ...
it's made my eyes water.
I am impressed, James
OK.
thing is though, OK.
you know when you take a Ferrari or a Lamborghini or particularly a Koenigzegg to its top speed...
no. - No, actually you wouldn't
but anyway, when you do
they fizz they buzz
they feels like all the body panels are peeling away because you're right on the edge of what's physically and technically possible.
Really? I didn't get any of that with this.
to be honest, the only thing I've got was at the end of the straight
I had to touch the breaks, so you see the spoiler come up slowing down.
you got a sort of ...
and that's it?
Yeah, just...
so it's kind of safe and relaxing even at 250 miles an hour
absolutely, yeah.
it's totally undramatic.
but I would give you a bit of warning which is a bit disorientating doing that sort of speed.
because, after I come off the banking
I was slowing down to stop
you know how you get a bit impatient, you think I'll just open the door
fortunately I looked back at the speedo and I was still doing 70
Umm.OK, so.
we've established that this is faster across Europe than - your light ari-craft - Yepp.
we've established that it realy will do 250 mph
but we've never been able to find out how fast it'll go round our track
now the problem is Bugatti are happy for us to have one here.
they are happy for you to go and do that.
but they won't lend the Stig one.
Umm.So really, this is an appeal.
if you've got a Veyron and you'd like to lend it to us.
we're prepared to pay anything up to 30 pounds
and now the news and we start off with the Porsche Cayenne because they've revised it and come out with a new one
it's got new prices, new bits and pieces, new engines,
but the most important thing of course about a Cayenne is that it's never been the best-looking car, is it?
no, not even slightly.
well, we can only assume that this new one still isn't exactly the best-looking car， because ，well, here is the official photograph that Porsche sent out for us.
I can hear the discussion of the photographer had actually with the director.
he said "Is the light good for you?" and he said "No, there is still is some."
Yes, exactly.
now, hey, you know that young Russian business kid who bought TVR a couple of years ago?
Yeah.
Yeah, we've got a picture of him here at a business meeting - Oh, yeah, there he is - There
did he close down the factory in Blackpool and make everyone redundant.
exactly, well, it turns out that all the TVR owners have decided that they're gonna throw a party for the workers who've all been made redundant.
the party dubbed fundable will include a buffet dinner,
how much do I don't want to go to that?
err, bar disco and live band.
wahl, a TVR band.
so they'll play presumably really loud really fast and then burst into flames.
here's some news, you know the hot Renault Clio, there was a really fast one
they've done a even hotter one, OK?
it's call the R27
it's got a lower stiffer chassis.
we've got a photograph of it here, OK?
now, these are the four Renault formula 1 racing drivers, OK, for this year.
now this chap, OK, the new one,
he really likes this car, he is very excited by it.
he is very, very excited...
he is very pleased to see it, isn't he?
really pleased.
what I love as well,
if you look around the other guys, who clearly spotted the problem.
well, you could hardly miss it, could you?
they're all very embarrassed. Don't look
well, you see this, Ok, I got this photograph from a French website.
the actually official photograph that was sent to it by Renault
let me show it to you.
look, there's he, go and stand behind the car now.
look how embarrassing he is. - But they are all racing drivers.
couldn't they've lent a crash helmet to hold it in the appropriate way？
it was his crash helmet that caused the problem in the first place.
leave it...
err, oh, now
news from the director of public prosecutions who I discovered in the paper this week he is called Can or something rather
not called Can.
can is the name of a man you borrow a step ladder from
Yeah.
not the director of public prosecutions.
can has announced that there is a whole raft of new motoring offences for which you can go to prison, OK?
one of them is, retuning your radio.
Oh, don't, it's stupid. - What?
seriously
but what if the Archers comes on?
I can't listen to an episode of the Archers in the car without losing my temper and having a crash deliberately to end it?
can has decided that we'll have to tolerate these things, because you're not allowed to retune a radio, you're also not allowed to put lipstick on.
again, what...
but get this one. You are not allowed now to be an undertaker.
what? I don't got it, an undertaker?
you an undertaker?
you're undertaker? You're going to prison.
can says if you "undertake" someone,
Oh, hang on.
well, it's... I've always had been a bit of beef about this.
because I reckon if you go pass someone on the inside,
there was room to do that, there was room for them to have got out of the way in the first place.
it's wrong!
they are the ones who should be prosecuted.
they can't find prisons to put pedophiles in.
but they're going to be putting him in it for being an undertaker.
it's ridiculous.
you know actually they can't find the pedophiles cause 300 have got missing.
I know where they are.
if you drive down the outside lane of the motorway now, not retune the radio at 50 miles an hour, OK?
you are immune from prosecution, OK?
so it's the ideal place to go if you're being looked for by the law.
so therefore anyone doing 50 in the outside lane of the motorway is a child molester.
wahl, that's amazing.
you use logic there. That's incredible.
argue with that.
Hey, now, can I just say, OK it's been a while since we sat here as a group as you know, so I thought it would be a good idea just to count through a few of the good cars and bad cars we've driven when we've been off air and I have to say, good cars for me, Lexus.
particularly, actually, the GS, the one in the middle
I'm with you.
the hybrid one, mate
no, no, this one, OK?
this looks like a normal car.
the great thing is, OK, its batteries will only take you less than a mile which means most of the time you are on the V6, you know, you chewing fuel, you warming the world, and everybody is happy, OK?
it's very quiet, it's very fast, it's very very comfortable.
and of course you can drive it to London, do U turns on Piccadilly all day long can't Livingston cop charge you a penny.
brilliant car there. - It is a hybrid.
it's a properly brilliant car there.
I'm gonna put like a little 9 volt battery in a Hummer.
it's a hybrid.
I was very impressed if I maybe buy the Suzuki Swift Sport.
I am. - No, it's...
this is the most underrated
it's not going over well mate, it's not going over well.
before you all chime in, it's a small car, but, you know I'm not a big fan of the new Mini
I've just... It's too big and lump and all the rest of it
that I think is the new Mini.
try it, you'll be amazed. It's brilliant that car.
that's an order from him.
actually, to be honest, I quite like that as well.
I, I... actually really did the Volvo C30.
I know, don't think I gone mad.
but it's a good looking car.
and you can get it with a 5 cylinder engine which is exactly the same one as in the Focus ST, the hot one.
worst cars, no question for me.
one of the top 5 worst cars I've ever driven. VW Golf GT.
there.
no, seriously, it's got a supercharged and turbocharged engine, which is as smooth as falling down stairs while wearing leg calipers.
basically if you tend to buy one of those, honestly, just work harder and buy the Golf GTI.
there is a Top Gear top tip. - good advice.
I was pretty disappointed, I hate I have to say this a Bentley Arnage T, not the R which is brilliant.
this is a useful consumer advice for people in the north.
well actually it is.
and I'm sorry it is.
because the T has a bit more power and a bit more torque and it's just enough to spoil it.
if you stick with the R, which is the beautiful car, they cost 12, 000 pounds less so you can buy a house.
for me, it was the Subaru Tribeca which is a MPV and technically it's not bad but it's hideous and it's a family car.
so my kids would too terrify to get in it.
hating it. it's not... it's just... it's hideous.
Hey, now, Jaguar have made a concept car.
well, not another one.
it's why they never make any money, isn't it?
because they just keep making concept cars all the time instead of just making cars that you can buy.
well I know, they haven't understood that if you sell a car, you get money.
Yeah.
anyway, this one, OK?
they say, which I've got a picture of it here.
OK? They say, that's going to be the next S type.
it will be looking exactly the same as that.
well, if that's true, that's fantastic news.
it looks brilliant.
I know. It does. I went to see it in the flesh the other day.
the designer was there and he said "I assure you, the S type will look exactly like that.
if that car comes out like that,
I'll cut my left leg off, beat myself to death with it.
Really? - Yeah.
do it.
make it, just make it.
now, if you're looking to spend between 20, 000 and 25, 000 pounds on a coupe, your choice just became a lot more complicated.
so, to see if we could help you out, the three of us have been to Scotland for a row.
these are of the cars that have caused the problem.
there is the new Audi TT, the new Alfa Romeo Brera, and the not so new, but still quite interesting Mazda RX-8
so, let's start with the Audi.
now I want to make it absolutely plain that
I did not like the old TT.
because all they did to make it was put a Golf in a pretty front.
that's like putting a cow in a track suit.
still not gonna win any running races.
with this new one though, they really have gone to towns.
it's longer, wider and more aggressive than the old model.
and even though this is the baby of the range, it's more technical as well.
take the body for example, from here back, it's steel, from here forwards, it's aluminum.
and that not only makes the car lighter, it's actually 9 stone less than the old TT, it also improves weight distribution.
then there is the suspension, the fluid in the shock absorber has got iron filings in it, then round the outside there is a magnet, turn the magnet on, your iron filings move about, everything becomes firmer.
and how much do you not want to go on a holiday with a man who thought of that.
the upshot is, this is no longer a cow in a track suit.
it's a cow GTI in racing overall.
the steering in the old car was numb, in this, it feels connected.
the ride in the old car was as comfortable as falling down a flight of stairs, in this, it's smooth when the iron filings are dormant and then when you push the switch to turn the magnets on it becomes racing car sharp.
this is not a car for taking your hair to the hair dresses any more, this is a car for making your hair stand on end it's a proper sports car.
rubbish!
what you want is one of these.
this is the new Alfa Romeo Brera.
it's a brilliant car.
on the face of it, the Alfa is exactly like the TT.
they are both four-seat coupes, they've both got four-cylinder engines, they've both got six-speed gearboxes, they both cost around 24, 000 pounds, and they'll both also be available with 3. 2 Liter V6 engines and four-wheel drive.
but actually, this is not like a TT at all.
now we've said this time and again on Top Gear
you can not consider yourself a true petrolhead until you've owned an Alfa Romeo.
they're not cars for posers, they're cars for connoisseurs.
there're some times, they'll infuriate you other times, they're really gonna thrill and excite you, but the point is: they're never, ever boring.
it was not designed like the Audi, using just science and technology and iron filings,
it also has soul and passion.
this car has a heart.
but you know what really swings it for me?
it's the interior.
sitting in here feels like you're sitting in a Milanese's espresso bar.
sitting in the Audi feels like you're trapped in a Berlin post office.
OK, then, James, have you told the ladies and gentlemen how fast the Brera goes from 0-60
no, I haven't and I was rather hoping you wouldn't bring it up.
but never mind, ladies and gentlemen, it does it in 8. 1 seconds.
which in 1976 would have been considered pretty brisk.
James, you could be out dragged but a canoe boat.
it's not a slow car, it's just not quite as quick as your car.
which is a car for people who use moisturizing products.
James, I'm with you.
I prefer an Alfa to an Audi.
but not that Alfa Romeo, that's too slow and that's an end of it.
it's not too slow, it's plenty fast enough...
James, our colleague has arrived.
here he is
lord Woolworth is here.
if it's power you want, then this is your answer.
the wankel engined Mazda RX-8.
when it comes to speed, it will do 0-60 in 6. 4 seconds,
that's a bit faster than the Audi and a whole lot faster than the Alfa.
top speed is round 150.
put it on a track, and you quickly realize what this car is all about.
about this engine, it is different, it's a rotary.
so you use it differently.
all the power is at the top end.
so you can crush it mercilessly, an it will thank you for it.
there is something else too，The Alfa is basically just an Alfa saloon underneath,
and the Audi is just an Golf in a fancy front.
the RX-8, however, is bespoke.
it was designed from the ground up to be a preliminary sports car.
this is the only one with rear wheel drive.
it is a proper blue-blooded driver's car.
listen to that, 7, 8 , 9
and yet despite all that, it has four doors.
you see, you got your big door at the front, usual sort of thing, then you got the little door for back seat passengers.
look at that，It's brilliant.
there're a few disadvantages I admit.
you'll struggle to get more than 23 MPG, it uses quite a lot of oil, and the depreciation is a bit steep.
but then a RX-8 is 2, 000 pounds cheaper to buy than the others, and 2000 times better.
and I don't care what those other idiots say.
a tricky decision then, three similar cars, but three different opinions.
to see if we could find a winner, the three of us needed to meet up.
so this being Scotland, the home of golf.
we decided to break out the Pringle.
what will you be using here?
how the hell do I know?
I've never ever played golf.
and it's like that, isn't it?
I can't believe you.
you seem to look like somebody who've done it...
Hahaha...
you've got dressed up in that outfit to do that.
to be honest, I could've carried it that far.
that doesn't look right.
how could it not look right?
shut up, watch and learn.
Wow! - It's gone in the sea.
it's gone in the sea. - Yeah.
I will tell you what, Richard,
your Mazda would look good here.
get off, it is not a golfist's car.
it is actually. - That actually is.
I'm fairly confident you won't see an Alfa Romeo in the car park.
no, we won't.
but I'm afraid I could see your car as well.
TT? - Yeah.
TT is the car for the kind of man who matches his belt to the little tag on these trousers and he is then proud and pleased with that.
what do they do and got they could do this, don't they?
he's gonna do it again.
it's like his pre-fly checks - I'll kill him, I'm going to kill him.
that's quite...
well it wasn't bad.
well, it was.
I just got a hole in 21.
we were extremely quick at getting to a new hole.
Oh - Oh, no... - Hahaha
Oh, well done.
but every time we got there...
Yes! Hahaha ... things slowed down again.
are you using an ace?
partly because we were useless and partly because we kept arguing about our cars.
that Mazda is chintzy, it's nearly as chintzy as...
Chintzy? I'm sorry, I just...
both of your cars are pompous...
rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish...
OK ，how long you wanna me keep saying rubbish?
this annoyed the proper men of Pringle who were queuing up behind us.
there is no Roush leather in the Audi, there is no...
well, practically, it might as well be Roush.
there're people behind us, they're very angry...
I know there're people waiting on
I'm trying just to get on with it, yeah, I know.
Nope.
after an hour we reached the third hole and were still arguing.
you are completely wrong about the Mazda.
technically it may be good it may be fantastic on the track, but it's not what's it about on the road.
it's too jigly, - it's too harsh the interior, - Jigly?
just because the Alfa is slightly slower, - You think it must be able to... - It's not slightly slower, James.
it's a little bit slower in the real world but in terms of being of the way it feels to drive, the balance, the feel of the steering, the ride, the little niggles you get in... it hasn't got a
how far can I hit his head?
... fundament like yours have
that's just childish and doesn't solve the argument.
after this, we were asked to leave.
and all we've managed to agree on is that the Alfa was the least golf clubish.
thank you, thank you obviously we will pick that up later on.
but now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.
please welcome to this poky motoring show, - How're you doing - Hi, good to see you. Very well.
have a seat. Uh... Have a seat.
and um... grateful you've come.
no, but it really is, because for the first time ever in the guest interview - we've got girls all around the front. - Ah... yes.
cause normally at this point they're all out side talking to Hammond, but now he's out there all by himself.
so let me start off with cars if I may.
big hollywood star obviously, so I presume you've got a Toyota Prius?
you would have thought, you would have thought, um... no,
I have... in my life I've had 2 modes of car, - Little tiny tossers' cars - Uh hum.
and great big [beep] cars.
um... - And you're in which mode now?
do you know, the first time I'm right in between the 2, the tossers' cars began with a...
a Citroen Dyane and I don't think you can get much tossier than that.
well the great thing about... No the great thing about the Dyane is you could crash it and nobody ever knew 'cause there were so many different angles on it that it was sort of always in...
Yes, yes, I know what you are saying, also it was... you couldn't hurt anyone because it had the power of 4 harnessed children and there is...
and then you got into the kind of - well you eloquently put it Wankers' cars - Yeah.
which started with?
well it started with, um, an Aston Martin Vanquish which was a beautiful car, you want to lick it or mate with it or something, but I never really wanted to drive it very much cause the gears did just occasionally, just when you were feeling happy in your car would just seize up, the car would stop, you couldn't even push it to the side of the road, you're just there on the A316 with people going past making wanker signs at you.
a lovely car.
yeah ,and then it was Bentley, wasn't it?
then I... yeah, I did have a Ben... I had a footballer's car,
bentley GT Continental, um, and very nice again, but I've got a bad back and for some reason it manifests itself some times as back pain and some times as bollock pain with the uh...
with the GT Continental, I got terrible bollock pain some cars seats do it my brother's Golf GTI was the first one hence the syndrome is now known as golf ball. Um...
and I got it very badly with the GT Continental so that had to go back after 6 months.
because of your testicles?
Yes, I didn't say that to the... um garage.
so um... then what... after the Bentley was?
then...
I had a beautiful Porsche which I actually phoned you about.
Yeah, well, actually your girlfriend phoned me up - Yes - And said listen - I've got to get Hugh a car - Yeah a Porsche... a Porsche, well that's wrong for a kick-off - but anyway she was adamant it was going to be a Porsche - Yeah
and then wanted to know whether it's going to be an automatic or manual gearbox?
Yeah. - So I said automatic.
Yeah, you're absolutely right and of course I got the manual, and it's so exhuasting...
cause you want... - All I wanted was a comfy environment
and a nice arm chair and for my balls not to hurt,
I got... it's not asking much for a car.
and the Porsche also has its interesting thing,
I think it's fine if the steering wheel's on "ze" left for "ze" Germans - I see, yeah - But on the right for the Brits, something's wrong I think the petrol tank's in the wrong place so you're facing forward like this with your upper body and your lower body is here sort of just looking dile... directly left, and I found that tricky.
that is tricky, I once had that in a Lancia Stratus but all... annoyingly in the Lancia Stratus all of you face this way while travelling in that... which it is really does make... it... the sensation of speed is tremendous
but you'd hit quite often.
now your driving, how's that?
do you have road rage?
terrible rage, yes, and uh...
well yeah, it's road rage that then becomes terrible road meekness in a flash...
in an instant... there was this guy who gave me the lightest of knocks, I mean barely touched the car and I went into a complete melt down, um... attacked him and when he wouldn't get out of his car, I thought
well I'll attack the car!
and I ripped the wind screen wipers right off his car, amazed at my own strength, and he said "You've ripped the wind screen wipers off my car"
and immediatelly I said "I'm so sorry."
"maybe if I... " I tried to put them back on, I said "I'll drive you to a garage"
pathetic... if you're gonna be angry you know, follow it through.
I once told... um someone who is staying...who had a dog in the hotel next to um... where I was staying that kept barking 5 o'clock in the morning,
I got up and then hadn't planned, this is always the play, if you don't plan what you're going to say - all goes wrong - Yeah.
I got out not sure quite what I was going to say, so I went "I've killed before!"
my wife was going "What have you killed before?" Anyway, that's...
let's talk about films, if we may.
your new film - Yeah.
OK, is you and Drew Barrymore - Yes, sir - And it's called?
it's called "Music and Lyrics" - "Music and Lyrics"
now, I'm sorry about this, we... we never normally do plugging on the show, - so I'm not very good at it. We'll try, - OK have you got any clips here? That doesn't work, does it?
we do have a clip, let me just explain what it is, um,
I play this ex-80s pop star, fallen on hard times,
I get this new contract to write a song for a very famous singer like it might be Britney Spears,
I write music, I can't find anyone to write lyrics until I come across this girl who sometimes waters my plants, Drew Barrymore.
and we write this song together and then the clip we see here we're just making a little demo tape.
it sounds so good,
I can't believe it.
and now vocals no, no， you see, you have to sing into the microphone, it won't follow you.
but I can't.
it's... it's a duet for a man and a woman, we are as close as we've got, your head phones and a level, you look nice in those, you should wear them all the time,
how is... that? Yes?
OK. - Shh... Shh... Shh
it's ok
and...
"way Back Into Love," take one.
Oh, oh God, I'm getting really nervous.
you'll be fine, you'll...
just use your normal nice voice that I've heard so much of in the last 3 days.
it's like my throat's closing up, it's like anaphylactic
it's fine, just a 3 minute song "I've been living with the shadow overhead,"
I've been sleeping with the...
just uh... a little bit louder because this song is intended for humans ok?
very good.
do you think?
it's a romantic comedy, Jeremy, which is something I've never done before, so um
I'd like to stretch myself as an actor, it's all about discovery, isn't it? Reacting, trying new stuff.
and it's a um... I think a lovely funny film
its open's on um.on the 9th of February.
em... can I just talk... ok, you're... we're the same age, give or take, I think...
it's hard to believe to look at it, isn't it? - Yeah.
frankly it is, yeah.
are you starting to fall to pieces yet?
yes I am, yes I am , Jeremy. Yes. - Are you?
uh... worst bit for me, is when you're...
you've wash... you've shaved, you're rinsing your face like this, and then you look up into the mirror,
I've got a mirror to the side here.
my eyes look up but my face is still pointing down.
that's... - That's how.
and also didn't you have some trouble with your bottom?
that was a terrible moment, yeah, that was a really terrible... I... I...
funnily enough that was for "golf ball," it was.
I went to see a doctor in Harley Street, and I... it was suspicious of him to begin with because he said uh...Very good if you'd just like to sit, pull all your clothes off?
so I... I took them all off, and then he interviewed me. I sat...
I sat naked as a baby in front of him like this in a... in a very expensive big consultation room while he wrote down things about me, kept looking at me and writing all the things down.
and then he said "Right, we're just going to uh... do a quick uh... prostate examination."
bent me over, and I swear to God, stuck his head up my bottom, because when he said "Does that hurt?"
it was muffled, it was "Does that hurt?
and it was the worst pain I've ever had in my life.
OK listen, I really want to get onto your lap, obviously.
Yes. - How did it go out there?
I thought quite badly, um...
I like the Stig very much, he was very kind to me um... but uh... it's not easy, it's not easy Jeremy.
you don't think so. - No, I don't.
cause it's so counter-intuitive, you know? Just when you're thinking:
well now I'm going to die so I'll brake but he says "Flat down with the accelerator!"
and uh... and the other way around and um...
I... I know I'm gonna be bad.
who here would like to see Hugh's lap?
Yeah! - Let's play the tape, here it goes.
this is you and there you go.
what a car.
that's... - A very unattractive helmet.
Oh, don't change gear, you [beep]!
crikey Moses! - That can not be my best...
that's quite grown up.
that was very good through there, excellent.
Oh where are you going now though? Yeah. - That's...
hammerhead - looking smooth and fast - I never mastered the Hammerhead - Is that a penalty? - That's good, no that's good.
good line through there.
Oh that was a piece of "art"
Oh [beep]
soon you're gonna cut inside and you won't be swearing.
is it gonna be fast through here?
see? Every time I came wobbling through a turn there was another ex-BBC camera man right in my way.
did exactly the wrong thing again.
and here we are, last corner - This is very poor - That's going wide that's wow yes! Across the line!
now
I um...
I know it's not good, I know, I feel... I feel like I've let anyone... everyone down - and including the Stig. - No, what do you mean? It's only yourself.
so where do you think you've come on the um...
on the board? - Ah, I wish I knew.
who would I really like... I wouldn't like to come lower than Michael Gambon.
michael Gambon? You've beat him. - Yeah.
Oh that's good. In that case, I... I quite like to beat you and McGregor.
well, you actually did it in 1 minute - Yes.
forty - Yes - Seven... Point seven - Yes - Oh hello. - Congratulations!
you're right up there.
you're in fact only emm.
point one of a second behind the well spoken man.
Yes, yes.
anyway, so there you are, uh...
ah sorry but Jamie Oliver was in the snow, so he moves up, is that right?
no he wasn't, it had melted, he did melted snow - He claims it was snow, and we punished him for that - Yes
so no, I... I think you're better and funnier and much better looking with a smaller tongue.
ladies and gentlemen, Hugh Grant!
right, now, earlier, we were testing three coupes to decide which one is best.
I really really like this Alfa Romeo Brera.
Clarkson stupidly prefers this new Audi TT and the damn fool Hammond seems to think it should be this Mazda RX-8.
and so far, we have established pretty much nothing.
but now in the second part of the film we drive into Edinburgh and still arguing.
can you set the sat nav in your car, OK?
err, no, I haven't got sat nav.
could you do that, Richard?
I go by instinct in here.
so it's the driver's car, or the navigator's car.
or the air hostess's in the case of yours Jeremy
think it with a bit of dust on my headlamps, so I will just wash that off.
Yes, I've done that with my headlamp washers.
have you done that, James?
well I did that earlier with a wet hanky and end of my finger.
but either of you two got a DSG gearbox.
no. - No.
have you got adjustable suspension, either of you?
no. - No.
but then I fired a torpedo straight into the side of HMS Clarkson.
Jeremy, can I just ask how much of that stuff is standard.
almost everything really is an optional extra.
how many is that lot cost?
err, the optional extras on this car add up 2000 pounds.
how much?
six thousand pounds.
six grand?
it's actually eight grand but shh...
it was tit for tat all the way and nobody was going to give in.
the truth of the matter is this the car you really want looks like the Alfa drives like the Mazda and is built like the Audi.
but since that doesn't exist you've got to have the Audi.
cause it's the best all round of the best compromise and that, that's an end of it.
it wasn't the end though, because coupes are all about looks.
and to find out which of ours was the best looking we've been told to go to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh.
the challenge was simple, if this prestigious gallery was to accept just one of our cars based on styling and love, which would it be?
a panel of experts have been assembled to make the choice.
and to help things along, we'd each been given two minutes to argue the artistic merits of our particular car.
but before that, five minutes in the gallery bookshop to bone up our art bit.
is there anything Japanese at all?
scottish arts...
you have like a single volume on the artistic influence of Alfa Romeo coupes.
err, Japanese culture in general maybe like into an oyster.
opening itself up to repeat the onslaughts from the... oyster.
unfortunately the crash course in the bookshop just confused us even more.
as the experts discovered when James kicked things off.
em, good afternoon professors.
I'd like to begin by asking the question
can a car be a piece of art?
I'd like to say immediately that I think no.
that's not a piece of art but can we find any art in that piece of design?
I'll put it down there.
can I really argue that the Audi TT was a reaction to the overly complicated ceiling rose of Victorian houses?
for example we can see in the lights of the Alfa Romeo here
I think the influence of the Scottish colorists, namely Fergusson and Peploe
you went to art school, you should be good at this.
did you go to art school?
no, I didn't.
then you wouldn't know what you do in art school is drink and pursuing women.
all arts I believe should be about two things, truth and beauty.
now, it's true because it's real.
it's not actually a piece of art.
how do we shut this man up?
do you know what? We've made amphibious cars, we've made a convertible people carrier,
I've raced you to Oslo
this is the hardest thing I've ever faced.
he's given the impression that he's taken his brush oil, even his calligraphy pen, the impression he has given...
I think we've probably heard enough,
that's alright with you, thank you very much.
I'll... I did want to talk about the renaissance and the meaning of truth - and the development of human thought - We could leave that for another day.
these trousers are not Bauhaus.
Hahaha
why we mates look a bit like a monkey?
their brains are big.
justify why you think your car should be in this gallery.
um, one can see influences of the Bauhaus thinking in so many of the things around us today, some of the design classic.
um Mart Stam's cantilever chair and the Marcel Breuer "Wassily" chair.
why is he talking about chairs?
it looks like it's going somewhere, it looks purposeful,
I mean if you compare it, for example, that's the inside of the Mazda, that's not Bauhaus.
that's my trousers...
woo, look, I found Jeremy's notes, trousers, fat, Hitler, tiger, Mazda, Alfa, modernism, minimalism ... minimalism, modernism
I think it created cubism, I think it created Picasso, no, not that one
cubism came about 10 or 15 year earlier, but go on...
I don't think that... I think the Audi is Bauhaus...
but I think it's got a very contemporary veneer.
I mean one shouldn't hang the whole item on the Bauhaus,
I don't think it's "Das ist einfach nicht wahr" as they would say in the Bauhaus
it's just not true.
what does it symbolize?
the Audi symbolizes freedom?
freedom! Like that.
warm in there, isn't it?
err, gentlemen,
God is the reason why you might look at this car the Mazda RX-8.
and see there's something a bit unusual.
the Mazda is a Japanese car.
in understanding a little bit about why this car is different to ours.
and you can see that express through out Japanese culture and paintings,
if you to take
we are just gonna see you put your hands in your pocket 'cause you're sort of refering to note here.
I can... I can do that.
em, if you refer to "Catching Catfish with a Gourd," from the 15th century by Josetsu
one of the blokes over there is an expert on Japanese and oriental art, you know that
can you just reiterate some of those points?
which point?
the ones you just made.
did you feel a bit thick when you finished doing it?
thick?
how do you think he is gonna feel?
he'll probably punch one of them...
I've eaten brighter vegetables than he is.
you put this car in the gallery...
yeah
what else are you going to have in the environment that surround it?
maybe to extend it further. Maybe to have some other Japanese stuff in there.
do you have any examples, that you think would be or value for the potential visitors?
some paint. Japanese paintings.
by anyone particular?
that would be for, perhaps, you know, specialists to choose.
how did that go?
I think well, I think well, err
do you know you're bright red.
Yeah, I'm hot, very hot.
the boffins conferred and then called us all in to give their verdicts.
I think the Audi is err you know sort of constrained, it's modest, it's sort of tidy.
but it's not saying, doesn't say very much to me.
you know, this lessness is less for me not more.
err, I'm most persuaded by the Alfa.
I agree entirely, yes.
the Mazda, I looked at it from various angles.
and it just doesn't seem to be as clear cut as an expression of what the modern art motif coupe is. And I think that's the Alfa.
in terms of the look, the style, everything that it denotes we'd be happy to show that car in this gallery, the Alfa Romeo.
well it's alright.
- Cause it'll just break down before it got here.
- You get oil all over your nice floor.
come on, you can stop being petty and infantile.
these three men are experts in art and artistic expression...
well, they are wrong. - It's only cause I've said freedom. That's what we...
well, rubbish.
as Richard said: They were wrong.
so now we're gonna do a much more important test which is the fastest around our track?
now obviously to find that out, we have to hand them over to our tame racing driver.
some say that he once had a vicious knife fight with Anthea Turner and that he is in no way implicated in the 'Cash for Honours' Scandal
all we know is, he's called Lord Stig.
well that has wasted about an hour with wheel spin.
get off, he started off in the best car.
the only proper sports car, of course the Mazda.
rear wheel drive of course, this is familiar to him, it feels like a sports car 'cause it was designed as a sports car.
radio: Lucy looked at him, the strong, kind face and the endearing look in his eyes, and she opened her heart to him.
now you see, this romantic fiction, he's into it now.
right over... oh look at that, you see, - it's so controllable, you can steer it with the rear end. - Is it moving? Is it moving?
rubbish, it's fast, mate.
don't ignore. Here we go , hammerhead.
Oh - Look at that.
no, no, that's miles off.
that is elegant and controlled.
that really is. He'll be enjoying that in there, - that's familiar territory for him. - 40?
and it looks at home on the track unlike the other two.
he'll have to lift off then.
it's not for... Oh, look at that. - 45
braking, oh he'll be around here in a minute. - Now he's got 1 corner and the final corner, - under control and looking like a proper fast car - Look at... chintzy styling - He's lost it, that's all... very bad. - Oh, what a spectacle.
still there,
no, good front end grip, good balance, excellent brakes,
Oh ho ho, did you see that dive?
wow, it's like watching the actual studio going around, isn't it?
that's balance and poise. - It's boring.
I suppose you're gonna tell us it's the most practical car, James?
well actually it is, you see.
because you can get 2 people in the front, 2 in the back and a set of golf bats in the boot,
I checked that.
Oh very useful.
and it goes off the road...
you know it's no good for golf cause it's the least Pringly and now you're telling this's got golf rackets in it.
look at that - It's... It's not turned at all there, it understeered...
look at this, really, I've never seen a car oversteer...
he's using all the track, - that's what... - He needs all the track, that's different.
it hasn't let... no, here we go, it'll just crash now, no, that was...
beautiful.
here we go, he's understeered...
well, no he's got it in... yes -Very neat, clip the apex.
and here - Steering accurately - Out of control
we got oil coming out of the bottom, right, gentlemen, behold the magnificent.
Oh you're off to the hair dresser, sir?
get off! - Hahaha.
Oh would you like any bred items?
I know you're thinking this is the old TT, don't muddle them up, that was for air hostesses, people who are orange.
this is the new one, it's a completely different animal, this remember it's only the front wheel drive one, the baby one, look at it.
front wheel drive, unlike a sports car, which would have rear wheel drive.
Oh you just saw the back coming round there, - it's got a little bit of left off over steer. - A little bit
I saw it, I saw the front nod.
here we go, just watch this, look at this, compare to your one James?
it's worse. - Boy, that was so slow!
it's not worse.
it is worse, look, it's on the grass, it's almost on the grass.
the... right... honestly, this is a completely different animal than the one we used to have.
this is fast. Yes. - No.
only the 2 Liter one, remember?
just the baby. - Miles out.
the V6 actually is nowhere near as good as this.
as we come up to the final corner.
it's going to under steer off and crash.
Oh, it's done it, it's off the road.
it's just airborne.
right, ready?
time for the Audi 1: 31. 4, check it out.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't be so confident, because you see my car, I think on a race track, you'll find that...
Hahaha, five seconds.
listen, you can stop being quite so cocky about it because your Audi hasn't won anything yet.
remember how it's been? It's not the best looking, it's the most expensive.
it's not the most practical.
exactly and we're about to find out that it isn't the fastest either when my Mazda beats it.
Hah! Oh...
damn...
no, no, no you've won.
I've lost.
no 'cause I'm gonna own up now.
secretly all along I've preferred the Alfa.
what?
no, I just know, I... seriously, I just... if it were my money, that's what I'd buy, and I'll bet you any money it's the same for you.
Yeah.
Yes, I knew it, I knew it.
but, I'm sorry before you get too cocky,
I would not recommend one to a friend.
that's the thing, cause you... well you wouldn't, you can't say "Yes, go and buy an Alfa"
cause then they'll spend the rest of their life in a car that just stays on the side of the motorway.
so I can't recommend one to a friend. Could you?
no, I wouldn't recommend one, no.
e... E... would you? - Come on.
no, alright.
there you are, you see? You wouldn't.
so what we've managed to establish is the best car here is the worst!
Yeah, wow we're good at this.
we are.
and that's the end of the show, thank you very much for watching, next week we've got a top gear special see you then, good night.
tonight, we cut some cars in half with saws.
richard smokes a horse.
and who is in our reasonably priced car?
Oh, it's his assistant.
Hello, hello and welcome.
thank you very much.
now, we start tonight with stretch limousines.
there are 9, 000 of the damn things in Britain and they are all American cars that have been elongated and then coated with a sort of veneer of velour.
Why?
why can't limos be based on normal cars that we can buy in Britain?
I mean, how hard can it be?
well, to find out, we were all three asked to build our own limousines.
the recipe is simple.
find a car, anything we liked, cut it in half, and then put an extra bit in the middle.
what could possibly go wrong?
this is what I'm gonna base my limo on.
Yes, it's a 1993 1L Fiat Panda CLX.
now the interesting thing about this car is under the bonnet it doesn't have an engine.
what you get instead is a small field mouse called Gerald.
break down baby.
Ah, if Gerald runs around this wheel really very very fast he'll get me from 0-60 in 18 seconds.
don't worry though.
there's method in my madness.
why start off with a big car when you're gonna make it big anyway.
and why have a big thirsty engine when you're gonna spend most of your time in town doing ten miles an hour, and if you put your foot down, everyone in the back is gonna spill their /.
my limo will be based on this, a sensible Saab 9000 3L V6
you're thinking: there goes, Captain Slow and I expect he'll do a really good job of turning it into a limousine coz let's face it, he's a bit boring.
Hahaha...
you can not even begin to comprehend the bound of my forthcoming genius.
for my limo, I've thought of a bit luxury up.
it's a MGF, which as you've probably noticed is a two-seater at the moment.
coz what I plan to create here is quite possibly the world's first mid-engined roadster limousine.
nobody has done it before and I don't understand why not.
why shouldn't "hen nights" have their wind-in-the-hair open top thrill.
so we'd all got our cars and we'd all found people who were going to help us turn them into limos.
this is the very same workshop where we made our convertible people carrier.
and that worked.
this job though, would require much more precision.
right, where are my hammers?
meanwhile, in my workshop, my genius plan was to make the Saab with a second car.
and here it is.
it's an Alfa Romeo 164 3L V6.
and I know it seems odd, but think about it,
no one ever said that the two ends of the stretch limo had to come from the same car.
I'd picked some motorsports specialists to help with the sports limo
there are a few concerns largely coz the engine is pretty much at the back.
so all things like these radiator pipes and the gearbox linkage from the front to the back and the throttle controls they are all gonna have to be sort of made longer.
right, this is the really clever bit.
although the Saab and the Alfa look very different, underneath, they got the same floor pan.
and more importantly, as my center lines show, the wheel base is exactly the same.
it'll be sensible and Swedish at one end and fiery and Italian at the back.
it is a Salfa Romeab.
here is a Top Gear top tip
rent one of these 35 quid a day. Somebody you don't like very much, cut their car in half.
my first job was to cut all the pipes leading to the engine.
Oh, that went really really well.
that's disconnected.
when do you think you're gonna cut it in half?
I'm not gonna get into a cutting-in-half competition with you, mate.
coz I know exactly what you're gonna do.
what am I gonna do?
make a mess of it.
Oh, that's not a good time.
hello. - Hamster.
Oh, bugger! Yes?
how is it going?
really well, actually.
you know what James has got?
Yeah. - A Saab.
no, he's got an Alfa. - No, it's a Saab.
no, it's an Alfa. he's got an Alfa.
but he definitely told me he's got a Saab.
so he doesn't know what car he has got. - He doesn't even know what he's bought.
is it true that Jeremy has bought a Fiat Panda?
Yeah.
I mean if you're gonna make a stretch car, why would you start with a Fiat Panda?
you can stretch it a mile and it's still only gonna be as big as a normal car.
well have you met Jeremy Clarkson big tall fella, curly hair, idiot.
that's your answer, really, isn't it?
finally, it was time to cut our cars in half.
What're you doing? - Cut it in half.
that's what half way, mate. That's about half way.
I'm not gonna measure it.
where are you gonna put you seats?
where is all the strength? OK?
it's alright, I'll weld that bit up.
inevitably James was being scientific about the project and was sawing his car in half using a plasma cutter.
now watch this.
I do know what I'm doing. I've made a bit of a plate.
and I'm gonna weld it over the little... the little hole there and you'll never know the difference.
by using patience and math to make my limo,
I was doing a damn sight better than Hammond.
bad, bad thing. Sorry.
it's locked, I can't get in.
the car is burning down before I've even built it.
that's bad, that's bad.
Jeremy had similar problems and couldn't even understand how the fire extinguisher works.
good coz I have a...have a... pull the safety pins.
that's fire.
eventually the fires were put out and by tea time Richard's car was in half.
there it is!
shortly afterwards, mine was unconjoined as well.
behold the broken car.
and with James' Saab predictably still in one piece,
I decided to make sure that mechanically at least my little Fiat had survived the operation.
and I'm delighted to say it had.
obviously, we'll be picking that up later on.
but now, it's time to do the news.
and we begin, well, actually, we begin with last week.
because you mocked me for wearing a suit.
you may remember this, yes?
because Kristin Scott Thomas was down here.
tuesday, he walked into the office dressed like this.
Yeah, alright. - Look at him.
Where'd you been?
I've been invited to No. 10
to a one-on-one chat with Prime Minister.
so I've, you know, put on a suit.
you say you going down there, you were in No. 10
Yeah.
sitting with him? - Yeah.
did you vomit on him?
no, you can't... you can't vomit on the Prime Minister, mate.
well, you can. If you had a load of cheese soup before you get there, and then lots of sour water, all over him.
you could easily have done that.
you didn't. - No. I didn't.
did you punch him in the face? - No.
no. I didn't vomit on or punch the Prime Minister in the face, OK?
how close were you to him, at any one point.
I was sitting next to him.
look, there is a picture hang on, there, you see? That's it.
you could have easily punched him in the face from there, you idiot.
/ sick. Look/ you just shed all over his leg and his cuff links.
no, look, I, that's...
those are the two things that you're best at in the world.
being sick and punching people.
he came around your house once, didn't he?
Yes. One time you came to my house, you vomited all over my sofa.
sorry about that.
my house, vomited all over me.
I did do that.
so you vomited all over you mates, why couldn't you vomit over him?
I'm sorry. He'd invited me around for a chat.
so it wasn't appropriate...
about what?
about road pricing.
and what did he say?
that we need to do something about congestion.
well did you tell him if he got rid of the bloody M4 bus lane, that might help?
did you tell him that?
I didn't say that. I wasn't sick. I...
did you tell him to get rid of the speed humps?
no.
did you tell him to up the speed limit on the motorway to 150?
coz that will surely... Did you tell him that?
alright! I...
punch him in the face!
I let you down, lads. I'm sorry.
because, ok, road pricing is coming, and it's his fault.
I now realize I've let you down and I'm sorry.
you see, it's not us.
you've let everybody down here.
you've let him down.
he can't even afford proper clothes.
you could've been the first person in British history to punch the Prime Minister in the face and be sick on him, let him...
alright. I'll be the first person to punch you in the face on TV.
now, that's more like it.
why couldn't you be like that with him?
can we move on? - Yes, we can move on.
now there's a new um Mondeo coming out in June.
and I've got a picture of it here.
and it will be brilliant.
it will. Well the last one was. It was brilliant to everything.
it looks fantastic. A couple of things...
I think it's got a bit too much mascara around its headlamps.
no, you need it. I had a bit of that going on in the studio last week actually.
the makeup lady put too much, err...
hang on. You were wearing mascara?
well, it's whatever the makeup lady puts on us before we walk in.
she... Yes, I guess so. I don't know.
you let her.
Oh for crying out...
well you let her make you look like a "spaniel" every week.
alright, I just want to get back to the car. If you may...
the other thing is I've looked this engine's spec
it's 1. 8s and diesels and 2 Liters. There is no hot one.
remember the days of the Cortina? There was the Lotus Cortina.
the Sierra, there was the Sierra Cosworth
there's no hot version of this...
coz what you want is like a Mondeo Vindaloo
actually, what if they just name the whole range after curries, depending on how hot they are.
Yeah, that's... - That's a good idea.
that's not of a bad idea.
you could do like / do those little chilies on the back, then I could have the jaal freezy.
Yeah, he could have the Korma.
Yeah, fast enough for me.
I really do like that idea.
coz you " re bring together sort of two great British institutions.
indian food and a car made in Belgium - Hahaha - Yeah.
now, you know that new law about kids under four foot five
they have to use booster seats in a car.
he does. - Yes, alright.
I just knew it. - Alright.
people under four foot five have to use a booster seat in a car.
but in North Yorkshire, the police say they can't enforce that law, do you know why?
they do not have the... heiheihei...
they do not have the legal ... heiheihei...
I can't wait for this now. The legal...
because they do not have the legal right to measure children.
just imagine...
just if you see the policemen measuring your children, you think "quick, call the..."
so they'll have to do what they used to do then they just put up some new sort of camera by the road to monitor children in cars to make sure...
no, no, you can't video children.
have you ever been to school sports day?
you have to ask every parent in there before they let you take your camera out of boot.
Oh go to your own kids' sports day, maybe they will let you...
err, right, moving on.
you know Aston Martin is for sale? - Yeah.
but I can't understand coz Ford the only profitable part of the whole Ford business is Aston Martin and they decided to sell it.
but anyway, the leading bid at the moment is from an Egyptian consortium
carpets will be nice.
really really labro/, really labro/.
Yeah, then buying one is gonna be interesting.
you get down to my brother's Abdulla Martin shop.
Hahaha.
for you, my friend. - I make my special price.
special price.
right, now, you probably know, the Vauxhall Monaro, one of our favorite cars and we were very disappointed when they stopped making it.
Yes, but now it's back and we've got one here.
it's now called the VXR 8.
fantastic looking thing.
it's got gills down here like a fish and it's now got four doors instead of two. Absolutely brilliant this.
but it still got the same engine.
so that's a huge 6L V8 that develops 414 bhp
Yeah, but you can get a supercharger kit for it.
which takes it up to 540 bhp.
but the best thing about it is the value for money coz the standard car's got 414
same as an Audi RS4
Yeah. - But it costs 35, 000 pounds.
that's 15, 000 cheaper.
I know, we love the Audi. Make no mistake.
I think the Audi is a very polite car.
this is more of a yobbo really.
this should come with like two butt cheeks on the back, so everyone behind is being mooned.
now, earlier on you saw us buy some old cars and set about turning them into stretched limousines.
next, we were told to report to the Top Gear test track on a bitterly cold day where we would be given a number of challenges.
well, here it is. My sports limo.
proof that style does not have to be slow.
it is genius.
this time, once and for all , I'm going to win.
I shall be victorious.
Oh my god!
it's a giant panda.
never before bred in captivity.
that is a big panda.
it is.
coz this is an economical limo.
1L engine, 40 to the gallon.
it's...it's just...it's my sports limo, mate. - Can we just...do you mind?
the first thing I saw obviously, was the spoiler.
it's proportional to the car.
you need downforce? Do you need that in this?
no, but it's part of image. And image is everything.
can we also say, you've no roof? - Yeah, I have.
Ha...that's it.
well it was complicated.
that's it.
there is a gap. There are tolerances here.
you could only work to so much.
then May turned up and boy were we in for a shock.
hang on.
now that, that I didn't expect. I'm confused.
well, can I just explain?
it's all about choice, OK?
at the front, it's a sensible Swedish Saab 9000, another front, it's a sporty and stylish Italian Alfa Romeo.
what kind of paint thinner were you sniffing in when you thought of this?
that theme, style, sensibleness, Sweden, Italy,
I've continued that on the inside.
because at this end, it is a sauna.
does it work? - No.
and at the other end...are you ready? It is...
the Sistine Chapel.
can you drive it both ways? Both cars?
Yes. That's the brilliant thing about it.
because what's the problem with a limousine? The Movability.
what? - Maneuverability.
no, I'm fine on that.
you may have an issue. - No, you have that obviously.
it's the very thin.
our first task was to test out each other's cars and we began with the panda's brilliant passenger entry system.
have you two ever seen the Great Escape?
I mean it's perfectly straight forward, look.
this pulley.
you lie on this, OK?
and Britney Spears is gonna do that, yeah?
this is ideal really for people who used to be miners.
I thought you had sniffed thinners making that.
James offered to join me in the back.
here he comes.
it's a ingenious solution to a problem that should never existed in the first place.
next, I introduced Hammond to the in-car communications.
this is an intercom system.
and it's hands free.
so if you put that thing around your neck, it's like a one-man-band thing
so it... it's legal.
this isn't the most elegant solution.
I've literally thought of everything.
right, I'm pulling away. Hold on tight.
here we go, going to beach.
you'll notice you swing around it, it doesn't have quite that same responsiveness.
running out of run way.
Oh no, I...
I'm sorry, I'm on the field a bit.
you see the sledge take some of the jolting out of it.
what have you done?
you've gone over a runway light you blithering idiot.
Yeah, right, you made the car a mile long.
it's hardly my fault.
even on our 160-foot wide runway, maneuverability was an issue.
but we did at least find a new way of speeding up my passenger entry and exit system.
here we go.
Britney Clarkson is leaving the car.
OK, we are arriving, I'll brake.
you're a comp..., it's an all over carpet burn.
how am I gonna explain this to my wife?
next, we try James' Alfaab.
James, a bit of an issue I've got here.
what? - Head room.
there is loads of it. What's your problem?
he's put a sauna in this end and he's put it on the roof.
your beer fountain... -Yes.
it's just making me want to pee.
but as problems go, that was nothing.
what's this stick?
no no, don't pull that.
what you've done...what's happened?
Hammond's unlocked the steering...in the wrong end, you idiots. - Sorry.
to try and regain control of the rear,
Hammond dived for the wheel of the Alfa.
not that way!
is that helping? - No.
I'll go the other way. Hang on.
it's bad for the sauna.
Oh my...ha!
no - James...
stop. - How the hell...
you pair of utter pillocks.
you've ruined my car. You've been...
if I was driving it like a limousine, and you two were just being yobbos trying to break everything, that wouldn't happen.
the engineering in James' limo hadn't fared well.
so, time to try out Hammond's convertible.
where is the heater?
well that is a problem.
coz the engine of course is at the back and the pipes are...
it hasn't got one.
you're the stupidest man I've ever met.
I'll tell you what though.
your car is a rubbish.
I'll tell you what though. - You put the roof up then.
mind your head, mind you head, mind your head.
Oh, you see?
it's no better with the roof up.
if anything it catches is the breeze I think.
Oh, that's gone.
that does happen.
how do I tell James to slow down?
Oh, that's brilliant. We call him on this.
what?
tell him to just slow down?
could you slow down a little, please, driver?
Yes, what do you want?
can you see us?
Yes, yeah, very funny.
to warm up a bit,
Hammond suggested we try some of his onboard sports equipment.
Yeah, go.
Yes!
the other thing that Hammond has done, is that he has fixed the seat in his drive...Ah!
Hahaha...
with our test drives over, it was time for the challenges to begin.
not all limo drivers are drug dealers, not all limos are used for hen nights, some have to be used for transporting political figures who may be attacked any time.
your cars then should be nimble and fast enough to get out of tricky spots.
well, that's you in trouble, what is it?
for the first challenge, you arrive at a road block, the other two presenters are there armed with paint ball guns.
how many hits can they score before you've done a J turn and got away.
he is in a convertible.
Oh no, I have not thought of that.
I was first to drive into the jaws of death.
Oh no, a pathetic road block.
now, a J turn.
you reverse at high speed, brake, spin the wheel, and as the front slues around, you slam it into first and roar away.
I must be honest...
Oh wait, now this is...
...the panda wasn't much good.
it's actually quite tiring, isn't it?
Yeah, just on the trigger thing.
Yes, I may be geting shot a few times now.
Ah...
Yeah, quite a lot.
Yeah, you...may have...
you could get more paint on it if you use the brush.
with my panda having set the bar pretty low, the convertible went next.
hope you don't mind the mask, but there is no roof.
hope I don't meet any terrorists
Oh no, terrorists!
do your J turn then.
the speed was good, the protection, not so good.
Ah, that's a shot in the head.
but I got one there and one there.
did it hurt?
Yes, like a...you know, hurt like a...
like a word you can't.
a paint ball in the head, yes.
Yeah, unfortunately, I suspect...
I think I've beaten you.
...you have beaten me.
right, James, good luck. - Good luck.
instead of doing the tricky J turn,
I planned to get into the Alfa end and reverse away forwards.
but that idea did have a flaw.
in fact, it had two flaws.
Oh the wheel wont...
Oh, look.
I don't know. You aimed at my gentleman's area.
that was chafing agony.
there is far more on you than on your car.
Yeah, well, so in that case, I've won. - No, no.
I know, hang on, the rule said...
but in the real situation, will you be thinking Never mind, at least my car has not got paint on it!
the rule said hits on the car, not hits on the wedding vegetables.
it was time for the next challenge.
I just hope that that was the end of evasive driving stuff.
evasive driving part 2:
it's a test of nippiness against the clock.
you break out from a terrorists' trap, slalom down the runway between strategically placed cars belonging to members of the public which you may not hit, steering around the stinger at the Hammerhead and pull up once you're out of the range of the water cannon.
the what?
with maneuverability being the key to every aspect of this challenge,
James was feeling confident.
watch this.
no, hang on.
what the hell. - He's still unlocked now.
how was he going to do a slalom.
it's not gonna help at all.
it's Hammerhead.
the water cannon kicked in to make missing the stinger even harder.
easy victory.
well, maybe not.
my sports limo was like a greyhound out of the trap.
Oh, wheel spin and everything!
that looks quite good.
I can't really see now ever having got into it in the first place.
it's the stinger next.
no, hang on, it's the water thing first.
convertible, as it turns out, not the best idea.
the panda broke out with ease.
Yeah. Rock and roll.
how can he do the slalom with a car that long?
looking good.
he is gonna to have to take the world's most enormous route.
Oh, for crying out now.
Oh no, I'm not gonna make it.
no, that's such a poor idea.
no.
Oh, there is some smoke coming out of it.
Oh doesn't that break your heart? - Yeah.
hey you, the clock is still running.
my limo had become bogged down.
but the film crew kindly pushed me out and I was on my way again.
no, you can squirt it as much as you like.
sadly, I hit the stinger which punctured the tires and then worse, my engine died.
that was sad.
Why? - What?
well I don't understand.
why did you get out of the car?
well coz it's got puncture and the engine had stopped.
so I thought if I get out, I would be able to change the wheel.
coz the water cannon was off.
I didn't know they were gonna turn it on again.
did you seriously think...
there was you out of the car, the water cannon,
how could they not turn it on and hit you?
well, with hindsight you're right.
I should've stayed in the car.
anyway, that wasn't the final challenge.
there was another one, a big one.
one where we brought the whole of central London to a stand still.
and we'll be showing that to you later on.
Yeah, can I just ask? - What?
your limo, down one side I saw windows.
on the other side, there were no windows?
no, it's paparazzi proof.
so if you got Britney Spears in it, she's forgotten her pants.
as she does.
which she is prone to do.
and now she's got matching, you know, collar and cuffs.
it's... so they could...
it was on the curb side, there were no windows.
I've thought of everything.
can I just ask why you shot me in the penis?
you did.
you think I could hit that when you were 50 feet away and running.
anyway it's now time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.
my guest tonight is attractive.
uh, she's futuristic and she's from Swindon, so she's sort of like the Honda Civic.
ladies and gentlemen, Billie Piper.
how are you?
do you mind? - I'm alright, thank you.
thank you so much for coming.
now this is marvelous.
you're so much better looking than everybody else. - Thank you.
and your top's more see through, so I'm really...
I know, I've just heard about that...
I've just noticed coz you walked out...I thought I'm gonna have to...
how bad is it?
it's quite bad. - But don't worry.
my bra's see through too, woohoo. - Is it? Really?
no, that's a joke.
No!
it is. Uh anyway, listen, is it true that you wrote your auto-biography - because you heard a biography was coming out? - Yeah.
I heard somebody else was gonna write one. - Yeah.
I was pretty convinced it was gonna be full of crap. - Yeah.
and so I thought I'd have a go myself.
did it come out? The biography, or did you kill it? - Yeah. No, it came out.
it came out, was it full of crap?
I didn't actually look at it, I watched its sales, it didn't do so well, but then nor did mine. So...
Did...well it's not like it wasn't full of stuff, not like Wayne Rooney, coz he was about 4 when he wrote his.
it's true. Have you read it? - He must have put absolu...
of course I haven't read it. - Right.
he was born, grew big in years, kicked football, slept with grandmother, it's not really...
it's not, it's not gonna be like yours let's be brutally honest. - No.
so why have you given up "Doctor Who"?
which is the question most asked by my 8 year old.
because um...
it just felt like the right time to go, it's 2 years in Cardiff.
Oh, you... - I know, I know.
I haven't realized. God I once went there for 2 days.
I'm going to hell. - I liked it very much.
no, I just, I just wanted to try some other stuff.
OK now, just before we move off "Doctor Who," I've got 1 important question:
what is the top speed of a Dalek?
I'm saying 6 mph?
they only do 6?
so you run faster than a Dalek? - I can.
why are you so scared of them then?
they're threatening things. They're huge.
are they huge? - They're about the same size as you.
I could have one. - Hahaha...
um now is it true, obviously we have to get it across for those you know - um, you know you're married to Chris Evans? - Yeah.
is it true he tried to pull you in a Ferrari? - That is true.
quite a thing, did it work? Well obviously it worked.
it worked, yeah, I married him, 6 months later...
what? Because of the Fer... - Not because of the Ferrari.
um... - Not because of the color of his hair obviously, that's...
I love the color of his hair,
I'm a big fan of the "Ginge."
Really?
Yeah. - Are there any here?
no, we don't let them in, that's it, we're trying to kick them out. - No.
they smell different, I find.
but he's covered it with...didn't he cover the Ferrari with roses?
Yeah, he filled the car with roses and then he covered the bonnet with roses, too.
did he keep it?
um... no we chopped it in for 3 classic cars.
which were?
um Moggie Minor, Jaguar Mark II, beautiful. - Yeah.
and a Mercedes, but I can't remember what it was - An old one? - An old one.
do you prefer old cars to the...? - Yeah, I love old cars.
why do you...old cars what?
I just think they're beautiful. They're works of art.
I'd much rather look at an old car. I have...
I'm not a huge fan of new cars at all.
so what's your car now?
it's a Porsche 911...
Oh God. Not another one.
1989
so an early one. - It's a nice model.
it's a 1989 Porsche 911? - Yeah.
for people who can careless what model number?
yeah I don't really know. - It doesn't really matter, does it?
all I know is that it's it's white and I love white cars.
now that's interesting. - Do you like white cars?
I think white's a good 70's color that should be making a come back soon.
you are a woman of course of great taste coz I did find a piece of uh writing the day that said you like a man with a beer belly?
I do. Hahaha...Smug.
yeah I do. - But you never...you thought the six-pack thing isn't for you?
it's not for me. I don't like it at all.
Why? - It's just too try hard.
it's just...You know I like men... you know. - I agree.
Yeah, I bet you're feeling like a bit of a berk now, aren't you?
he's been standing there you know that thing...
...men do with the pushing their arms out. Look at him.
he's like "look at my muscles here, look at that."
they're very nice.
now stick your stomach out, you aren't be able to share it, are you? - That's perfect.
anyway I wanna talk about your lap, how was it out there?
um...I was...it was ok.
it was a lot harder than I imagined,
I got a bit angry as well which I don't think is good.
angry with the Stig? - Myself, not with the Stig, - I love the Stig. He was very patient, very generous. - Really?
Very...was he? - Yeah, hahaha...
it's just unfortunate that he's got really toned body. - Does he?
yeah and a face like the elephant man, um...
that's a shame.
did you call Chris up to get... - Yeah.
and he said? - He said "listen to the Stig and work with the lines."
would you like to see it?
alright.
who'd like to see Billie's lap?
OK, let's have a look.
shake and bake.
second gear.
and third next?
Ooop you cut the corner a little bit there but hey that doesn't matter coz it just slows you down.
where are you...where're you going? You're on the wrong side of the line.
must beat Gordon Ramsey.
OK into the hammerhead and...
again that's entirely the wrong route.
Oh God, this is terrible.
jonathan Ross was the last person here to get this lost.
hell.
Yeah, that was...
you got the right way, didn't turn right there, that's good.
and then through second to last corner, that's where everybody get's it wrong but that's a very good line actually there, and then this isn't...
and there we are and across the line.
that wasn't great, was it?
well...
where do you reckon on the board that was?
please tell me I'm above Steve Coogan.
above Steve Coogan. Well you are.
however we do have a problem. - Why?
you did it in 1 minute 48 point 3.
to the stunned silence of amazement of the entire audience.
but the problem we've got is that we've had to have a word with "His Stigness."
Why? - Well because...
...you didn't really do a lap of the track.
I mean you didn't do the same lap that all the other people have done.
does that matter?
well, do you know, yes, it does.
no, it doesn't, please no.
well, I don't know what to do because the Stig says he reckons it's a 3 second penalty for cutting the corners.
I told you he was an unpleasant man. - He's not a nice man.
what do we think? Leave? Leave it there?
leave it there?
people power, I'm sorry... - I'm quite happy with that.
well you would be.
I would do this like "I could get home in a really quick time if I just drove straight through..."
you're staying where you are.
ladies and gentlemen, Billie Piper! - Thank you.
now, this is the new Mustang
we drove it a while back and we found it a bit...well, lame.
but the thing about the Mustang is you can always improve the breed.
as I shall now explain with a rather noisy history lesson
one of the many great things about the Mustang
is that it really introduced drivers to the whole idea of options of specking up your car.
so when it first came out in the early 1960s, nobody wanted a bogle standard one with a 6 cylinder engine
they wanted ones like this
the GT390
this is the Bullitt Mustang
the one Steve McQueen hurled into movie history around the streets of San Francisco
the GT390 is, in car terms
one of the seven wonders of the world
the noise, the presence
very very few cars live up to their hype.
but this car does, and I should know
because this is my GT390
and I'm using it to make a Mustang point
everything that made it good
the engine, the lights, the stripes was extra.
basically if you wanted a good one
you have to forget cheap and cheerful and go for the bells and whistles version
and that's what's been missing so far from the new one.
untill now.
this is the Mustang GT500
and from every angle you can see it's muscle car biceps straining to burst out of the body work.
it's also festooned with menacing Cobra badges
attribute to tuning legend Carol Shelby
now Shelby only ever put his name to the fastest and the most powerful Mustangs
which means this thing has gotta be more than just a fashion state.
and it is.
good, God.
you see this car has the super charged V8 from the Ford GT.
this means power goes up from 300 to 500 horse power.
0 to 60, 4. 9 seconds 0 to 100, 10 seconds
in America the GT500 has gone down a storm
the queues are out of the door and ram the block
now if you wait your turn
you could put one of these on your drive in Briton for 35, 000 pounds
sounds tempting.
question is: Should you?
let's start with the power
that 500 bhp, it's a bit ... you know, neat.
this is a rolling road
it's a sort of lie detector for engines and gives the true horse power reading
Genuenly looking forward to this
what it's got?
Really?
right
so this GT500 actually makes 447bhp
err. Almost
there you go. That seems fair enough.
you know, thinking about it, why not got the mechine here.
please don't hurt it.
it had, when it was brand new, 325bhp
and I'm assured by the man who sold me it that this is a fine example of the breed.
250bhp
anyway, back to the job in hand and speaking of disappointments
multi-link geometry
Dual-way remote reservoir dampers
fully independent rear suspension
these are just some of the things that this Mustang...
...hasn't got
no, what this car uses is a live axel.
which as rear suspension goes is basically a whacking grate girder with a wheel at each end
it's not exactly the most modern layout
Noah's Ark had a similar set-up.
because the technology is old fashioned you can have some good old fashioned fun
but when it all goes wrong the Mustang becomes as precise and dynamic as ... well an ark
now Ford say they didn't give the GT500 modern suspension
because it would've added 5000 dollars to the price of each car.
that is a ridiculous decision
you can't just give a car an extra 200 bhp
and then leave it with prehistoric suspension
what you're left with then is a car that looks great and goes fast in a straight line
and that's it. But don't despair.
if you really want to spend 30 grand on a Mustang that looks good and goes fast in a straight line
then why not buy the one that has the pedigree and the history
and makes a great noise
buy this one...well not this one obviously.
it's a bit down on power.
no you're right, you're absolutely right.
you cannot put...
can't put that much power in a car without changing the suspension - You just can't, or the breaks. - Exactly, the rest of it can't handle it.
anyway, we must now find out how fast the Shelby goes round our track
and to do that we gotta put it in the hands of our tame racing driver.
some say that he isn't machine-washable and all his potted plants are called Steve.
all we know is he's called the Stig
OK away it goes.
and you can see the back wheels bobbing around struggling for grip.
that's the low-tech suspension for you.
let's see how it affects things in the corners
diving into the first one now.
looking fairly composed so far, not too bad.
just breaking loose a little bit on the exit there
radio: Guiding his hands she helped him to unbutton her pretty lilac blouse
more gushing fictions from the Stig's collection there.
Chicago now.
you see it tried to cock a back wheel and then it gets all out of shape on the way out.
that is messy
hammerhead now.
heaving forward on the breaks and he's lurching over into the turns
Stig kicks it into a bit of a drift
it's smoking inside wheel but not elegant
radio: Locking her arms around his neck she softly pressed her lips to his
into Follow through, chance to see this car in its best now which is in a straight line.
Yep, that's fast through the tires two corners left
Oh dear wallowing about like a frisky hippo there
just Gambon to negotiate now
he holds it in, dab of opposite lock and across the line
he did it in 1: 30 exactly - 1: 30 so... - Precisely, yeah
the same as a Monaro
err, yes which is good but ...
it's good, but the thing is you can see it wobbling about in that film
I mean the Stig is just all over the place.
and that really brings me on to this
OK? which is the Roush Mustang.
now it's only got 415 bhp this, OK which obviously isn't as much as the Shelby
but they have changed the suspension they have changed the breaks
I drove this last year in America and it was just bri...
I mean really properly brilliant car this.
but if I'm right, this is what?
10, 000 pounds more expensive than the Shelby
well yes, but it's 10 grand more car, it really is
in fact earlier on, after the Stig'd been out in the Shelby
we gave this to him and this is what it looked like out there
here he is, coming up to, where is he now? That's Chicago
you see, look, there is no wobbling like there was in the Shelby amazed. You hear that supercharger whine and the exhaust
this is got a limited slip diff as well which the shelby hasn't so it doesn't just spin all the power away on the inside wheel
it's ... Oh God that's such a nice car.
do you know what the time was? - Go on
OK 415bhp, what was this? 450 there about.
it was 1: 28 - Wow.
1: 28 so it's 2 seconds faster than the Shelby
but it is M3 money
Yes, but honestly I'd have one of those
if I were the sort of person who looked at my sister and thought...Emm
now earlier, you saw us buy 3 normal cars and turn them into stretch Limousines
then we went down to our test track for a series of challenges
and I have to say
that Jeremy, your Panda was rubbish, mate.
absolutely rubbish - Yeah, it wasn't brilliant, no
it came, what? You got the most hits in the anti-terrorist test - Yes it is - And it was knocked out by a hose pipe.
anyway, for the final challenge
we were told to smarten ourselves up
because we will be chauffeuring top celebrities to this year's glittering Brit Awards
yes we would and the winner would be the person who could get the most photographs of their celebrity in the following week's newspapers and magazines
this is what happened.
before being allowed on the road each of our cars had to face a goverment inspection to make sure they were road legal
Hammond's sailed through no problem at all and so amazingly did May's me though, I had a problem
for some extraordinary reason the rule say you can't drive a 46-foot car on the public high way so I had to do some surgery
I had to lot 7 feet out of the middle which has affected the rear leg room a little bit
but it is now quite nippy coz it's only emm, 8 feet longer than a bus
for my pick up, I had to go to a hotel in Chelsea to collect a Brit Nominee called Lemar
He.hello!
Mr. Lemar - Yes - My name is May. I'm your chauffeur for the day. - OK.
umm, this is your car.
en, it's a ... it's an Alfa Saab
meanwhile, I've been sent to EMI records in West London
it's just got a bit dent, it's very simple to polish it out.
everyone's a critic.
my VIP pick up was R&B star Jamelia
Oh my God. Hahaha.
OK! No expense spent!
while Hammond got the glamorous singer, I had to pick up a fat man
Oh, God.
Chris Moyles, Radio 1
this is your luxury limousine transportation
not what I had in mind
right
here we go. Sit back relax
Oh...What's it done?
OK, if you'd like to step in
that will be great and we'll get off.
what?
um, this is the intercom. - Yes.
you press that button if you want to talk to me.
if it starts to rain, don't press it, because you'll get electrocuted.
eventually though all our passagers were on board and we were ready.
are you comfortable?
no.
good God.
we were all now heading for Earls Court
the Brit's is one of the biggest night in the showbiz calendar with most celebs hoping to look impressive by arriving in a big shiny German car
we were gonna show them the error of their ways.
it's better than a Audi this will get you noticed
you know what happened to Dave Lee Travis ？He is on three counties radio now?
coz he didn't think to use cars like these for going to awards ceremony
now I've chosen this route to demonstrate the brilliance of my car.
meanwhile in the Alfaab
Lemar was riveted by James' conversation
there is a small issue with the congestion charge because as I'm sure you know the camera records the rear view of the car but when they look at the photographs
it'll give the regestration number of the saab but the photogragh would show the front of an Alfa
so we're looked as...so somebody with the wrong sort of car for the number plate has reversed into London back in the Panda my demonstration of its brilliance wasn't going too well
you're crutching it.
Oh.
um, it's still standing.
exactly, there isn't any wrong with it, shush.
we can edit that bit out
so when the digital camera takes picture it thinks "Well, that's a Saab
but when they look at the photo they'll see it's a Alfa Romeo
and it's going the wrong way
height car on the left there sir.
in the MG poor old Jamelia was attracting a lot of attention from fans
not least because Hammond'd had to modify his intercom to make it legal.
sorry about the fan thing trying to chat you up there.
that was a bit awkward for you - I'm sure I've got... - I can't hear you.
Oh.
so, Jamelia was embarrassed in the MG
Lemar was bored in the Alfaab and Chris had yet to appreciate the Panda's brilliance.
that, oh. that's
that is a catastrophe it's just happened now.
can you, is that car behind you very close?
yes
and then Lemar woke up as he began to realize that
James had no idea where he was going
the car doesn't have navigation, um? I take it.
well, it has navigational source, it has a driver who's lived in London for 20 years 21 years actually
where are we now sir?
um, we are just coming onto um.err...
to distract Chris from the fact that we were almost constantly stuck
I engaged him some musical small talk
I once went to Earls Court in 1976
saw Bad Company there, Simon Kirke
he did a drum solo like you wouldn't believe.
it was now 6 o'clock
Lemar was supposed to be at the Brits in half an hour and James was miles away.
stuck in the side streets of central London
actually if you don't mind sir, this is sort of where I need your help - Um, because the reason - OK this car would go round in very small corners is because you can steer it from both ends but I'm afraid I have to ask you to sit in the Alfa Romeo and steer
by this stage Moyles was hungry and thirsty and because I haven't thought of include any onboard catering
he'd been shopping for supplies.
what was that?
I was getting on my seat.
Oh, sorry. I thought someone's run into us
turn left
right, left?
Yeah, your left - My left? - Yeah.
that's it, That's perfect. You see.
straight around that very tight bend.
you see now a normal Limousine wouldn't go round like that, would it?
let's do another one, hard left sir
OK, so , this umm... your steer.
the whole thing is not ...
I.You need to straighten it up a little bit - So we're crabbing round badly... - I can't
because the whole.you know, your wheel spin is a bit...
Jamelia was closer to Earls Court than Lemar but no happier
the... the accelerator's stuck open a bit
but if you think about it.
I have to link it to the back of a car
it's hydro gas suspension and the clutch and breaks, all the things...
Oh, hang on.
that doesn't sound good.
that's...
Oh, sorry.
road closed. I'd better go right.
and then it got worse
that's not come well, has it?
where are you going?
you're going that way, right.
sorry, sorry.
Ahhh!
sorry.
Oh my God, you're just the worst driver... - Sorry.
that's the famous Harry's department store on the left
earlier when us talking about circles, you know
I mean, Harry's, seen it twice.
I don't really need to see it a third time.
the bus couldn't back up and I was stuck on the double mini roundabout - I can't make this turn Chris, at all - Look where you're going.
thank you. There we're clear, right.
earls Court was now just minutes away.
what was that noise?
at the Brits
the world's media were waiting for Jamelia's arrival
I still don't think you appreciate the complexity of linking up a rear engine car when you stretched it.
please listen just let me get out here!
no, no, red carpet there is for you.
I'm so embarrassed!
and she wasn't too pleased with my clever exit solution.
no, on the other side,
on the other side.
sorry about the ladder thing coz the steps weren't ideal.
while Jamelia regained her composure
I checked on the others.
Jeremy, how are you doing?
umm, not well
it's what?
into two pieces on the Lily Road.
it's broken in half.
haha. I'm sorry not to give you more support but...
sorry Chris.
I'm getting, getting like an hour late, or something like that.
at this rate, isn't it?
you know
the first time I'm nominated
best male, you know? Hey, best male. Come on.
surely sir. In the music business it's fashionable to be quite late anybody
nobody ever turns up on time really.
there's fashionably late and there's stupidly late, you know.
I can only apologize sir, but it's...
I don't wanna hear anything, just please, just get me there
well, there is five minutes to go
may's hopelessly lost
Jeremy's car's split in half.
that means, by defaulting nothing else, I'm the winner.
Yeahhh!
Hammond may have been gloating.
but I wasn't out of the competition yet.
what time do the awards start?
about five minutes.
that's here, end it.
Oh. Wait, wait, wait...
dignity, wait around a bit ... - OK, dignity yeah, dignity - Red carpet's over there. - What? Well...
so Moyles was happy.
but Hammond wasn't.
you cheated!
you finished with half a car.
you're supposed to finish with a... - This is stretch.
I've got the man here
meanwhile, in a car somewhere nowhere near Earls Court
Lemar acknowledged as one of the gentlemen of pop had had enough.
Strickly speaking is left.
but I think if we go right I can go round the back...
what do you mean right? - And then...
well. - Right, why? you just said.Now listen, you just said go left.
right, so why.so, so. - Most people would go left.
most peo. so why don't we just follow what most poeple would do?
because I think if we go right
no are you doing this intentionally now?
no. - This...decision is just stupid. It's just stupid.
are you a jerk?
no. - This is what you plan...You come to mess up my day?
you picked me up.
you drove me round and round in circles in London.
been passed Harry's 11 looks hundrud times now.
left you turn it to go right.
I'm not taking this anymore.
open this damn door. For crying out loud! - I think it's...
the stupid door doesn't open. I've had it!
forget it.
Lemar go like that with him after half a day - We have to work with him all the time. - I know
anyway, clearly, I won.
no hang on a minute.
the competition was to see who could get the most photographs of their celebrity in newspapers and magazines
now I know this is the most pointless question ever
since you ended up in Norridge.
how many?
Ahh.None.
none at all, and you? - None.
don't tell me there was a picture of Chris Moyles somewhere.
Dataa. look it out. Read it and weep.
there it is.
wait, hang on. That's your page in your newspaper
yes?
well, you cheated.
you two have both got newspaper columns, you could have done it.
you just didn't think.
come on Jeremy, you can't claim you've won just because of the passport picture.
yes I can. It's the winner.
but you hit every single bollard in East London.
west, James, west. - West...whatever
and then you finished with half a car.
you're half a person.
it doesn't seem to bother you. Anyway I . I'm afraid I did win that, chaps
on that bombshell it's time to end the show and indeed the series.
um, we've no idea when we'll be back.
I tell you something though. The three of us will be back here to record a special Top Gear of the Pops for comic relief in a couple of weeks
and we hope to see you then
thank you very much for watching, Good night.
top Gear
Hello! Thank you, everybody, thank you, and welcome to what is a Top Gear Special, a two-part adventure around the heart of Africa.
we were each told to buy a second-hand estate car here in Britain for not more than 1, 500 quid.
and then we were told to report, with our cars, to the start line, which was in a small village in rural Uganda.
so, you've seen Sir David Attenborough's take on Africa, now it's time to see ours.
I was the first to arrive and I was feeling a bit nervous.'
as you can see, I've gone for a BMW 528i, and on the internet, it looked fantastic.
but, I've now had the chance to examine it more closely, and one or two things are giving me cause for concern.
for example, it's got a manual gearbox.
now that tells me the previous owner was the sort of chap that likes to take it to the max between gear changes.
secondly, the front tyres are Pirellis, the back tyres are made by a company I've never heard of.
so that tells me it's been run on a tight budget.
I don't know what the challenge is going to be, but I'm going to be doing it like that.
Oh, hang on, that is the throb of a turbocharged flat-4 engine.
a sound which, all over the world, heralds the imminent arrival of a moron.
and it did here, too.
it's Richard Hammond, everybody, who I suspect has started to dye his hair.
see what you think.
Hammond!
and there it is.
it is, yes.
well, there can be only one word. Legend. Subaru Impreza WRX estate.
and driven by emeritus professors all over the world.
Yes, yes. No, no. Just hang on. Here's my thinking.
I don't know what challenges face us here, but think about it.
subaru stands for Toughest-Thing-On-The-Planet,
WRX stands for world rallycross, which the Impreza just owned.
it's all there. Four-wheel-drive, turbocharged estate.
but you're going to look stupid doing it.
I don't have to look.
I know I'm wearing double denim, and that is a mistake, but you've got Daktari trousers on, and the wheels of the agri-yob.
actually, it looks a bit like you.
what?
you know, small, and with a sort of surprised expression.
a tree!" Yes.
a house!
well, then, that's perfect. My face in that car.
honestly, I'm so chuffed. This time, I've done this right.
big boot. Practical.
practical?
so, what have you got?
Oh!
528i, rear wheel drive, 2. 8 straight-6.
how many miles has it done?
151, 000. This, though, is the last of the mechanical 5-series.
after this, they started using computers.
what, their solid state?
this is simple, mechanical engineering. Anyway, listen.
yes?
James isn't here. No.
no surprises there.
I know for a fact what he's got.
go on.
he'll have a Volvo.
Yeah.
he'll have gone... Yes, yes, yes.
because you know he's got no imagination at all.
as it turned out, James did have a Volvo, but not the sort of Volvo we were expecting.'
that isn't an 850 R, is it?
it is, it is!
that's a bold call!
gentlemen. Yes?
you bought an 850 R?
it doesn't matter, it's a Volvo.
this defines the estate car. Nothing else is an estate car, only this.
have you seen the tyres on an 850 R?
well, there aren't any.
it has tyres.
it's just a thin veneer of paint on a wheel.
but they're high-performance tyres. It's a high-performance car.
I know. It does 146mph.
do you remember British Touring Car Championships?
these were great fun to watch.
Yes. And they were on dirt tracks, weren't they? No.
racetracks. Yes.
do you think when Volvo sat down to the design the 850 R, they said, "Now, Africa.
we need to try and get some market share over there, so let's lower the suspension, fit very low profile tyres.
they didn't think that in so many words, but when you design a Volvo, you design it for everything.
it doesn't look at home, does it?
that looks at home.
that looks at home on the M4 in the outside lane, too close to the car in front, being driven by an embittered toner distribution manager.
he's right.
let's be honest.
that's going to beach.
it's not. It is!
as we argued, a challenge arrived.'
Oh, hello.
thank you.
Oh!
you will find the source of the River Nile.
that's it? That's it.
Oh, so we're Livingstone, Burton and Speke!
Yes, we are.
and I have the right car!
Oh, come on, for exploring. If Livingstone was still alive...
he's not, is he?
no. Ken Livingstone is, but it's not Ken Livingstone.
if the other, explorer Livingstone bloke were alive, he would drive a Subaru Impreza WRX estate.
Yeah, but Speke, my favourite of all the Victorian explorers, Beemer man.
was he? Yeah.
so do we just go that way?
