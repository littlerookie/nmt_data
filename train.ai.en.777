no deal?
very well. Kill her.
No!
that was unexpected.
fire!
come on! Come on!
get her to safety! Now!
I'll only slow you down. Go!
just go! You've got to go!
go! Go!
it's happening. - I'll give you 10 minutes to state your case, Roy.
so tell us.
why do you get to live?
I shouldn't.
just do it.
kill me.
just go on! Kill me!
you really don't care if you live or die?
no one's going to miss me.
I'm just a waste.
then we agree on something.
this world would be better off without you in it.
we seem to have lost the feed.
we will stay on this story and keep you up to date on any developments.
let the kid go.
you kill this kid, you'll never get an opportunity to change!
you can give him a second chance.
we're the only ones who can save this city.
we can't stop now.
we're not the same!
you've killed people for this city, so have I.
what's the difference between you and me?
Emma never got her second chance.
you have no idea how lonely it is.
I understand being alone.
but it doesn't give you the right to kill people in cold blood.
he deserves it.
just like the gangbangers who gunned her down, he's no different than them.
and now I get to gun him down.
don't do it!
got to get going to the airport.
that red eye to Central City.
I should be home in a flash.
mom.
call me some time.
I'd really like that.
you would?
of course I would.
you're my mother.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
I thought you were going to die.
that makes two of us.
I probably look like a mess.
I'm going to go to the bathroom and freshen way, way up.
OK.
I heard Thea's friend was ok.
Yeah. That worked out ok.
this Roy... is more than just a friend, isn't he?
bad boys.
hook you every time.
Oh, I think, uh, Tommy actually went home for the night.
you all right?
you seem like you're something other than all right.
my mom, she showed up in town this week and she's been...
what?
she had this crazy idea that Sarah was still alive.
she was so sure of it that she kind of had me believing it, also.
but Sarah's gone.
Yeah.
I can't believe she sucked me in like that.
you miss her. - I miss them both.
thanks for listening.
of course.
want to have dinner, or... coffee, I don't know.
Why?
I don't want to be on an island anymore.
good night. - Good night.
circuit board's gone.
damn. Fyers played us.
while he was screwing us around, his men were combing the woods for it.
now his missile launcher is fully operational.
and he was never going to let us off the island, I get it!
of course he wasn't going to help you.
he couldn't chance you warning the mainland what he has planned.
she speaks English. - Yeah, well, guess what.
neither one of us have any idea what his plans are.
I do.
thank you for coming, Frank.
meeting like this is dangerous, Moira.
particularly now. - Yes, I know.
Malcolm knows. - What?
I had no choice but to turn over what I've discovered.
the evidence of the wire transfer; the money that you paid the Triad to assassinate him.
the money I... Moira!
Mr. Merlyn thanks you for your loyalty.
you've done well.
now Chen's family will share his fate.
chen betrayed us, but his daughter didn't.
tell Mr. Merlyn I want her to live.
Amanda nearly lost her life in the Glades, now she's lost her father.
I think she's suffered enough.
we must send a message.
we have.
very well. - Thank you...
Thea's friend is upstairs. - I saw.
you probably saw that they were very happy to see each other, if you know what I mean.
which you probably don't want to talk about, because she's your baby sister.
you ok?
I'm getting there.
thank you.
by the way.
if you ever need to tell someone about your day... You can tell me.
what's that?
felicity pulled it up. It's an old map of a decommissioned subway line.
runs underneath the low rent district of the city.
I've seen that map before.
it was right in front of our faces the entire time.
my father, the other archer, the undertaking, whatever the plan is.
it's all connected to the Glades.
my name is Oliver Queen.
for five years, I was stranded on an island, with only one goal: Survive.
Oliver Queen is alive.
now I will fulfill my father's dying wish...
to use the list of names he left me, and bring down those who are poisoning my city.
to do this, I must become someone else.
I must become something else.
so you met up with the Hood guy?
he's contacted me before.
you're a murderer.
you were my best friend in life, but now it's like I don't even know you.
I quit.
listen, Lyla, Lawton is a very dangerous man.
what do you know about him?
that's everything you need to locate who's giving Deadshot his targets.
this Lawton kick his dog or something?
he killed his brother.
I can't move on with my life knowing that he's still out there.
I thought if anybody got that it'd be you.
you two have unfinished business.
where do we start?
you feel better?
I'll feel better once we end Deadshot.
welcome to Germany, Mr. Ambassador.
Henrik, you're looking great.
we have to end this guy before he makes any more widows out of wives.
we will.
Diggle, we'll stop him.
I promised you I'd help take him down, and I keep my promises, but he's on another continent.
not anymore.
I thought it would be helpful to track A. R.G. U.S' manhunt for Floyd Lawton aka Deadshot, so I decrypted their communication logs.
which means, I just hacked a federal agency.
which kind of makes me a cyber-terrorist, which is bad because I really don't see myself fitting in well at Guantanamo Bay.
don't worry, Felicity, they don't send blondes there.
I keep your secret...
Hey, what'd you find?
Deadshot is scheduled to meet with a potential new client here in Starling City.
except the potential contract is bogus.
your friend Lyla is setting a trap for him. Lawton took the bait.
great, I'll talk to Lyla, see if I can suss out any details.
good. I've got to have lunch with Laurel.
so when did you become, uh, lunch dates with Laurel?
look, we're just... We're friends.
friends are good. - But?
couldn't you be friends with someone less complicated than your ex-girlfriend, who's your ex-best friend's current girlfriend?
I wear a hood and I put arrows into criminals, so when it comes to complexity... I grade on a curve.
rescuing your father and stopping Fyers is not going to be some walk in the park.
they're not going to allow us to just stroll on into their camp.
which is why we'll need cover.
if both of us are infiltrating, who'll provide that?
he will.
me?
the assault rifle is flushed.
it's useless.
we have a bow, arrows.
and no one capable of shooting them.
no offense, kid.
I was going to say the same thing.
I think we should be spending our time trying to devise a plan, not lower our already slim chances of survival.
he'll hit his mark by sundown.
if not, we'll do it your way.
what is it, Johnnie?
just came by to see how things were going on your Deadshot investigation.
anything new come up?
funnily enough, it did.
I was curious why you, a bodyguard, were so keen on taking down such a high profile assassin, so I did some reading up on Lawton.
Lyla, listen...
did you really think I wouldn't find out that he killed your brother?
that you were using me...me!
to what? Draw him into the open so you could take him down yourself?
I will not let you use my agency to settle your blood feud.
Lyla... I need to see this guy in a bag.
you of all people should get that.
get this...stay away from Lawton, Johnnie, or so help me, I will have you arrested.
you doubt me?
never have.
did you get my voicemail?
things got a little crazy around here... back to back meetings...
I am so sorry, rain check?
sure.
I could definitely catch up on some club paperwork.
we're way behind since Tommy left.
I'm still shocked that he went to go work for Malcolm.
you know, you were really understanding to let him take this opportunity.
Tommy said you were cool with it.
why wouldn't I be? He's my friend. Like you.
I'm sorry, are we early?
no, not at all.
uh, Oliver, this is Eric Moore and his wife, Nancy.
I'm prepping them for a deposition for tomorrow.
and this must be your bodyguard?
this is our son, Taylor.
it was nice to meet you.
Eric, Nancy, I want to make sure that you guys are up for this.
edward Rasmus isn't known for playing with kid gloves, so this could get rough.
we invested our entire life savings with Rasmus and he stole it.
our retirement.
Taylor's college fund.
he stole our future, Ms. Lance.
we want it back.
well, then let's go get it.
Hello?
Mr. Moore? I have some documents for you from Ms. Lance related to tomorrow's deposition.
what a nice home you have here.
you can really... Feel the love.
sorry about the mess.
this works better if it looks like a break-in.
is it done? - The parents, yes.
I'm afraid there's been a variable. The child got away.
got away?
did he see you?
no, Mr. Rasmus.
what he saw was the face of the man who will reunite him with his parents.
Starling City is expected to be host of this year's Festival of Lights exhibition.
in other news, the bodies of Mr. and Mrs. Moore were found early this morning.
the couple were being represented by attorney Laurel Lance of CNRI in a lawsuit against financier Edward Rasmus.
miraculously, their seven-year-old son Taylor survived the horrific attack.
this isn't your fault, Laurel, you shouldn't feel guilty.
I don't feel guilty. I'm angry.
this wasn't some random break-in.
edward Rasmus is involved, I know it.
OK, listen, our guys are looking into this.
but you need to stay out of it, ok?
because if Rasmus is behind this, he's clearly not messing around.
uh... If you'd like to say good-bye to Taylor,
I will be taking him over to child services.
doesn't he have any other family?
grandparents are in Melbourne.
we're tracking them down, but until then, he's going to be a temporary ward of the state.
he can stay with me.
as his attorney, I am assigning myself temporary guardianship.
you'd still need a judge's order.
I'll have it to you in an hour.
well, have it your way.
OK, look, I'm going to park a patrol car outside your place.
fine.
and you... You look after them, all right?
I spend most nights at your daughter's anyways.
there was probably a better time to tell you that.
probably not.
Hey, come stay in my house, ok?
what are you doing here? - I heard what happened.
I just wanted to make sure Laurel was ok.
you could have just called.
I met Laurel's clients and their son yesterday and I felt badly.
you met them?
Yeah, when I was picking up Laurel for lunch...
which she didn't tell you about.
tell you what?
nothing.
it's settled.
Taylor's coming home with us tonight.
well, if you need anything... - we're fine.
OK.
we should really get going.
here.
set your sight.
hit the tree.
probably hit a tree.
set your sight.
hit the tree.
steady your anchor point.
I hope you're getting closer... At teaching him how to be a better marksman.
it's not as though our lives depend on it or anything.
try again. - Ok.
what's this?
Lyla's mission profile on the trap they've set for Deadshot.
Lawton is set to meet his new employer and get his assignment tomorrow at 8 pm.
only, his new employer... Will be an A. R.G. U.S. agent.
Lyla will then swoop in with her team and arrest him.
do you want Lawton arrested?
then tomorrow night, we cross Floyd Lawton's name off your list.
there is something else we need to look into.
two of Laurel's clients were murdered last night.
their seven-year-old son barely escaped.
that's terrible.
edward Rasmus, the financial advisor Laurel was taking to court, may not have pulled the trigger, but he probably called in the hit.
I want you to get into his corporate accounts, phone records, anything that may link him to the killer, ok?
where are you going?
Laurel's.
another friendly meal?
my daughter is secure at her place? - So far, all quiet...
all right, let me know if there is any movement.
I'm heading over there right now.
what did you steal this time?
you got a minute? - No.
it's about the Hood.
when my men found you on that subway car after you were kidnapped, you told them you didn't know anything about the vigilante.
so there's something you forgot to tell them?
I just want to see him brought to justice like everyone else.
don't worry, kid. We'll get him.
just keep making sure I don't have a reason to get you.
Taylor? Sweetheart?
are you hungry?
you know, I make the world's best macaroni and cheese.
it's the only thing she knows how to make.
I miss my mom and dad.
when I was your age, my mom tucked me into bed that night before going out.
then the next thing I knew, there was a police officer at my door.
he said that she was gone and that I would never see her again. But you know what?
he was wrong.
you saw her?
every time I close my eyes, I can see her.
every time I go to bed, I see her in my dreams.
Really?
Yeah.
now try it, close your eyes.
I see them.
whenever you are sad, or scared, just remember that they will always be there.
you constantly surprise me, Merlyn.
I'll get it.
ms. Lance?
lieutenant Kessel, SCPD.
your dad asked me to check in.
lieutenant, can you hold your badge up to the door, please?
OK, great.
just one sec.
what?
his badge number begins with a zero, Lieutenant's badge numbers begin with a one...
it was the badge that gave me away, right?
you know, my father's a cop.
and that's not all he taught me.
I'm feeling like it might be time for you to move.
dad, whoever Rasmus hired is going to keep coming until he finishes the job, otherwise Rasmus will just hire someone else who will.
OK, listen, I want the three of you in protective custody immediately, and don't even think about it.
he killed two of my men.
the Hood just saved our lives.
we can trust him.
he won't let anything happen to me.
even if I was comfortable with the idea of him watching over you 247, which I'm not, something tells me he's got better things to do.
what about Oliver?
sorry, you got another friend named Oliver?
the Queens have more security than the President.
they've got cameras everywhere, bodyguards in every wing, and no one goes in or out without being accounted for.
we both only want what is best for Laurel.
and right now that is to stay close to Oliver.
trust me.
this is Mr. Robbins.
where you go, he goes.
you'll be very well protected, Ms. Lance.
thank you.
I hand-selected these men myself.
the house and the grounds are completely secure.
please make yourself at home.
you must be Taylor.
how about I show you where I hide the good cookies?
Mr. Queen, whenever you're ready,
I can take you to your next appointment, sir.
the Lawton meeting?
Yes.
I just need to swing by the club and pick up my good suit.
so, I'll meet you there.
of course, sir.
you're leaving?
there's something else I need to take care of. It's important.
more important than what's going on here?
no offense to Oliver, but I think we need Mr. Robbins and his men more than him.
you are the reason why we're here, and trust me, that wasn't easy to admit.
you'll be fine.
I promise.
you know, chewing might help.
not dainty enough for you?
don't forget that.
what is that?
suspected vigilante activity, requesting all available units.
do you have a police radio in your pocket?
no, I'm just happy to see you.
got to run.
I think you've got something that belongs to me.
you set this up, just to get your radio back?
well... I do love that radio.
come on.
I'm uploading a satellite overview of the Plaza to your phone...
Thanks, but I know the place...
dig was pretty specific about where you should perch...
you know, what position gives you the best shot at Lawton.
I think.
he used a lot of military jargon.
so you're sniping a sniper.
kind of ironic, don't you think?
me neither.
what's that?
I had a remote access trojan scouring the Internet for Edward Rasmus.
his name just popped up on a flight manifest, 8:15 to Shanghai...
he's running. - That's good, right?
if he's leaving town, he won't be after Laurel and the child anymore.
but if you did want to stop him, looks like it's now or never.
Deadshot or Rasmus... Your choice.
trap one, this is Harbinger.
wait for Lawton to enter and make contact.
then we'll take him down.
damn it, Oliver...
just until this CNRI mess dies down.
and if it doesn't, two best things about China... wontons and no extradition treaty.
Hey, hey, I thought I was paying you extra not to stop at the reds.
trap one, possible target acquisition.
get ready.
stand down.
maybe Lawton didn't take the bait after all.
we're blown! Take cover!
on your knees. On your knees.
hands behind your head.
I saw you coming a mile away.
thanks for tipping me off.
I'll kill you for what you did to Andy.
I'd be pulling these triggers right now, except there's nobody paying me.
there's space for you right here, right next to your brother.
you'd do best to remember that.
what happened?
you didn't show, things didn't go well.
Rasmus was skipping town... And I had to reprioritize.
thanks to your new priorities four agents are dead, Oliver.
you could have stopped this guy, ended this maniac once and for all.
Lawton got away?
you seriously think a man who goes by the name "Deadshot" was going down without a fight?
I needed you there, man.
Taylor Moore was relying on me, Diggle.
but this was never about that kid, he is safe under armed security at your house.
this is about Laurel.
Diggle, I made a choice.
I know.
you chose Laurel.
always her.
everybody else be damned.
something to say, Felicity?
nothing you want to hear.
try again.
you're thinking too much.
nobody ever accused me of that before.
show-off.
I see my target in the distance, I feel the variation in the wind,
I hear the bowstring tighten... And I let go.
give in to your senses... Don't think.
you're right, this is definitively not the time or place...
no, it's...no, it's just there's, uh... Someone.
and it's a mile past complicated, but I can't.
does she know how much you love her?
I suspect right now she doesn't.
but as soon as I'm home, she will.
you looked so beautiful that night.
I remember Oliver telling me once that he wished your father would let him come over to your house more often.
that being there made him feel less like Robert Queen's son and more like himself.
I liked who my son was when he was around you.
thank you.
the police just called.
edward Rasmus was arrested.
Really? What happened?
apparently he confessed to everything.
he's going to go to prison for a long time and won't be able to hurt anyone ever again.
why would he confess?
the vigilante was involved.
good for him.
so, I guess it's over.
Yes...Yeah.
great, I'll go wake up Taylor...
no, Tommy, please. He's sleeping, he's been through a lot.
now you all are welcome to stay.
we certainly have enough room.
it's your call.
thank you, Mrs. Queen.
I guess we'll stay, then.
good.
your lawyer's here.
I'd like to discuss loose ends.
you didn't get my message?
forget about the Moore boy.
I've already confessed, that freakshow in a hood told me he'd kill me if I didn't.
we need to make this meeting appear legitimate.
lawyer stuff.
sign here, please.
am I clear? You leave the boy alone.
I wish I could, but he's seen my face.
just like you.
if you put pressure in just the right areas above the forearm, like I did to you, an embolism will form in the medial antebrachial vein.
when the air pocket reaches your heart in, give or take, fifteen seconds, you'll die. It's relatively painless.
nothing personal.
we're done here!
excuse me, hi, I'm looking for my boyfriend, he's kind of a regular around here.
piercing blue eyes, and may or may not have stolen a police radio.
Yeah, that's him. Behind you.
well, that's a nice look.
what were you thinking? - Well, if it isn't the wonder twins...
he's very sorry for stealing the radio, and he won't ever bug you or steal anything from you guys ever again.
both of you. Come with me.
what are we doing here?
well, your boyfriend is so interested in the Hood,
I thought he might like to meet someone else who already made his acquaintance.
Oh, God...
who was he?
well, that's the thing. When you're alive, you get a name.
when you wind up down here, you get a number.
meet 26.
see, your pal the Hood, he's already sent 26 stiffs down here since he started his little one-man... War.
maybe this guy deserved it. - Maybe he did.
but that's not how justice works.
you see, the vigilante, he doesn't have to answer to anyone but himself, and that's a very dangerous power to give to any one man.
he saved my life.
and how do you know tomorrow he won't just as easily take it?
get out of here.
let's go.
he's safe now, Laurel.
with a hard road ahead of him.
well, he's lucky to have you in his life.
I know the feeling.
when you first got home, I didn't think that you changed much.
but you have, and... It's nice to see.
thank you.
I have a delivery van coming in for Ms. Lance, his I. D. checks out.
thanks for the heads up.
For...Ms. Lance.
what a beautiful home.
such pain here.
Tommy... Can you two stay here with Taylor?
where are you going? - It's an old house, fuses blow all the time, it's probably nothing, just please... Come on. Ok.
he's here.
Where's the child?
this house is quite large and I don't particularly care to check every room.
very well.
Laurel... Laurel, don't... - No, Ollie is still out there.
what happened to you on that island?
you're about to find out.
death by poker.
that's a new one.
he was going to shoot me.
and then, uh, mister... Robbins, he grabbed the poker and... saved my life.
Mr. Robbins was a real hero.
if it weren't for him, we'd all be dead.
I've got enough details for my report.
I'll clear my boys out of here.
let's go.
you still love her. Don't you?
it doesn't matter how I feel.
because of what I do... I could never be with her.
you see, you don't have anything to be afraid of.
she is never... ever going to know my secret.
it doesn't matter if she knows.
I know.
and I don't know how to be with Laurel knowing the entire time...
that if she ever found out who you really are... she would choose you.
thank you for everything you tried to do for Eric and Nancy.
and for keeping Taylor safe.
come here.
you keep being a good boy, ok?
Tommy, I really need to talk to you...
what's that for? - It's my stuff.
what's going on?
I'm not sure that I'm ready for the kind of commitment that you're looking for.
I don't want to hurt you in the long run, so...
wait. We both almost lost our lives, and I'm emotional, too, but you can't be serious.
this is me serious, Laurel.
but... But it doesn't make any sense, I mean, why... Why now?
why even at all?
I thought that I wanted this.
you.
and the other night made me realize I don't.
you're lying.
I am not a liar.
if you've changed, and I know that you've changed, then you wouldn't...
you would never do this.
then I guess I haven't changed as much as we all thought, then.
I know.
you think I'm an idiot.
I always thought you were an idiot.
now I think you're brain dead.
Yeah, you're probably right.
look, I don't understand this, Roy.
why is finding the Hood so important to you?
I can't stop replaying that night in my head.
the night I got kidnapped by that psycho,
I just... I thought I was going to die.
but you didn't. - Yeah, because of him.
you don't owe him anything.
you're wrong, I owe him everything.
and I can't go back to the way things were, Thea,
I can't just go back to being nothing.
you're the one that keeps telling me that I can be better than who I am, and this... This is my chance to be.
I can't explain it, but... It feels like my life is connected to his.
so let's find him.
I can tell this means the world to you.
and you mean the world to me.
so let's find him.
you and me.
vigilante, here we come.
was hoping you'd be here.
I want us to get back on the same page.
Oliver, we're not even in the same book, you and me, not anymore.
I just did what I thought I had to.
just like I'm doing what I have to.
we're done.
don't do this.
the only thing you have to stop me from going out that door is an arrow.
Where's he going?
so how did our Robin Hood do?
as expected?
so back to the drawing board we go.
yao Fei!
Ba!
how did you escape?
I didn't.
you son of a bitch...
your time on this island is at an end.
my name is Oliver Queen. For 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal.
survive.
Oliver Queen is alive.
now I will fulfill my father's dying wish.
to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city.
to do this, I must become someone else.
I must become something else.
yao Fei! Ba!
how did you escape?
I didn't.
you told me to stay away from your family and I did, but your family isn't staying away from me, which means something must be done about it.
you're going home.
about my mother, and about her involvement in the Undertaking.
she's working with Malcolm Merlyn, and they're planning something terrible.
so, I was wondering.
there's a late night happy hour at Stella's.
you know, the place across the street.
you mean the place that's always playing loud salsa music at all hours when I'm trying to work late?
that--that would be the one, yeah.
anyway, I was thinking that, um, maybe, you know, if you wanted to, we could perhaps grab a drink?
how about two?
Oh, my God!
please.
I did everything Mr. Merlyn required of me!
he knows, Dr. Markov, and he thanks you for your service.
open the door! Open the door!
Freeze!
No! Open the door!
get down on the floor!
I've been watching your mother for days now, Oliver, and nothing.
she goes to work, she comes home. Occasionally she goes out for dinner.
she seems to particularly like the salmon tartar at table salt.
I'm linked into her home and office phone.
nothing out of the ordinary.
no mention of Walter's abduction or the Undertaking.
just a few innocuous calls to Malcolm Merlyn.
why wouldn't she call him?
they're old friends.
we're all old friends.
are you ok?
my mom and my best friend's dad are involved in a conspiracy that may have dire consequences for the city.
and I'm pretty sure they murdered my father.
listen, all we know for sure is that Malcolm and your mother are planning something for the glades.
and that Walter and I were getting too close to it, that's why they had him kidnapped.
we have to find out what this Undertaking is.
I got to ask her.
well, no. The last time the Vigilante paid your mom a visit, you got shot, and I got to play doctor with you.
Ahh! My brain thinks of the worst way to say things.
this time it'll just be me asking.
friendly mother-son chat.
Laurel? What are you doing here? It's not even 7: 00 a. m.
that's just after closing time, right?
how's business?
well, it's busy.
busy. It was easier when Tommy was running things.
Tommy's a good guy. Yeah.
are you?
what do you mean?
last week, I told you that I wanted to get back with Tommy.
that I needed you to go to him and explain to him that you didn't still have feelings for me.
but instead, you told me that you did.
as I'm sure you can probably imagine,
I haven't been able to think of much since.
I shouldn't have said that.
then why did you?
I didn't... have an agenda.
I didn't mean to make it more difficult for you to fix things with Tommy.
but what if you did?
after you disappeared with Sara.
I was sorry I ever knew you.
but now, things have happened that I never thought would.
you coming home.
my parents being in the same room.
and you.
what if I'm finally starting to see you for who you really are? No, Laurel, it's
and maybe Tommy was right.
maybe he and I weren't meant to be.
maybe I'm finally ready to admit that...
that I still have feelings for you, too.
nothing's changed.
my life hasn't changed.
I haven't changed.
I got to go.
Walter's coming home.
everything's exactly as you left it.
how are you feeling, Walter?
I'm on the mend, thank you, Oliver.
Oh, I'm so glad you're home.
that makes two of us.
all of us.
we've prepared a delicious brunch for you.
all your favorites.
Oh, yum, English food.
actually, I'm more tired from the drive than I expected.
so I think I'd like to lie down for a bit.
Yes, of course.
Walter doesn't really seem like himself.
he's gone through a lot.
it's just... going to take a little bit of time.
I'm really sick of us all having to go through a lot, you know?
six scientists and three security personnel are confirmed killed in the massacre.
among the dead, respected seismologist Brian Markov.
a spokesperson for Unidac Industries says a comment would be forthcoming.
mom, we need to talk.
Oh, uh, later, Oliver.
...co-workers, parents and families of all the victims to see how they're coping with their loss.
you! Save it.
we don't have the luxury of indulging in vendettas.
Ba! Shado.
you led Fyers right to us, you coward!
Fyers was about to fire bomb the entire forest just to eliminate you.
this way, you all have a chance.
well, pray I don't get the chance to repay your mercy.
how fitting.
everyone reunited for the end.
the end of what? What is all this for?
HKIA, this is Ferris Air flight 637 out of Paris, nonstop to Hong Kong.
we are steady on approach at 33, 000 feet and winds at 15 knots.
ETA, two hours, 15 minutes, over.
Ferris 637, this is hkia.
adjust course to 0. 6 degrees south.
11 minutes, over.
Roger, HKIA. Why the course change?
nothing to worry about, 637.
just looking to make sure you avoid a little turbulence.
Roger that. Adjusting course now.
they're altering course, sir. The plane will be in range of Lian Yu in 26 minutes.
good. Keep tracking it.
that's a commercial airliner, Fyers.
it's not like it can land here.
it won't be landing anywhere, Mr. Queen.
I'm going to destroy it.
arrows are black, not green.
copycat archer again.
psychopaths are color-coding themselves now.
that's helpful. Yeah, except we haven't seen the copycat in quite a while.
OK, last time he took hostages to draw out the Vigilante.
this time, he massacres a bunch of lab nerds?
I want a press lockdown, nobody hears about the other archer and we need to get a list of all Unidac employees and find out what they're working on here.
apparently it was a tight group.
anyone who knows anything about the project is dead.
and the copycat fried all their computers and burned their research.
whatever's going on here, someone doesn't want anyone to know about it.
where did you even get that camera?
come to think of it, where did you get this car?
I borrowed it.
illegally.
you know, when I imagine being in a car with you, this isn't exactly what I had in mind.
Yeah, well, you're the one who said you'd help me find the Vigilante.
I know, but it's been two weeks, and the closest we've come is snapping photos of the cop who hates the Hood just as much as you worship him.
I don't worship him.
I just need to find him.
you don't need to find him to be somebody.
besides, it's not like you're going to meet him any time soon.
just that the cops don't have a clue.
we don't know what they know.
OK, I officially do not like that look.
you still work at CNRI, right?
Hey, Mom.
Walter's upstairs resting.
I think he's... doing well, don't you?
who took him?
well, we don't know yet. But I'm going to make sure all the resources of Queen Consolidated are behind it.
that's the answer that you gave to reporters yesterday.
tell me the truth.
I don't know what you mean.
I think you do. A couple months ago, something about our family being in danger.
but it was harder than you thought.
please, Mom.
let me help you before you drown.
you need to stop asking these things. Do you understand?
I need you to stop.
I can't.
I need to know.
is that a power outage?
I don't know.
mom!
you have failed the city.
it doesn't make any sense!
why do you want to blow up a plane?
the Dow Jones dropped nearly 685 points.
can you imagine what would happen to China, were to be grounded indefinitely?
you want to destabilize China's economy?
it's not what I want, but rather my employer.
and that will decimate China's economy.
I said I need you alive, but I can kill everyone you care about.
help you with something?
Yes, um, I'm from CNRI and we're investigating claims of racial bias in SCPD arrests.
so I'm going to need a copy of each file 2011 to the present.
it's almost 9: 00 at night.
Yeah, well, tell that to Judge Crow.
he's the one who signed the court order.
wait here.
I don't know, it seems like a bit of a reach.
Yeah, which is what you do when you got nothin'.
cause all I know is the copycat, he torched every record down at Unidac.
and all we got are phone records.
a couple of calls? Did I say reach?
I misspoke. I meant leap.
did you find anything?
lots.
anything helpful? No, still looking.
what about you? You learn anything from the cops?
as a matter of fact...
I like the sound of that.
you know that copycat archer?
Yeah.
turns out he's connected to Merlyn Global somehow.
or, at least his victims are.
we're looking for the Hood, not some crazy wannabe.
please!
do not hurt my son.
tell me what the Undertaking is and I won't have to.
No! Tell me!
please!
leave my son alone!
what is Malcolm Merlyn planning?!
I can't tell you!
he'll kill me, he'll kill my family.
you should be more worried about what I'll do.
No!
Malcolm is planning to level the Glades!
he said so he could rebuild it, but...
how?
there's a device. What device?!
he says that it can cause an earthquake.
how is this possible?
I don't know.
it was invented by Unidac Industries.
Malcolm used my company's Applied Sciences to turn it into a weapon.
why would you get involved in something like this?
my husband...
he got involved without my knowing.
he was just trying to do some good.
he was lost. He...
his decisions left me vulnerable to Malcolm, and I had no choice.
I had to protect my family and my children.
this device... Where is it?
I don't know.
if you don't tell me, I can't stop Merlyn!
Oh, you can't stop him.
it's too late.
no, no, no, I told you everything!
No! Oh, sweet
please, I know what you must be thinking, sweetheart, but I never intended any of this to happen.
I don't know anything anymore.
Oh, my God.
you said you were going to pull your punches!
I did. Let me get you an icepack for...
everything. I'm fine.
well, we know Queen Consolidated acquired them seven months ago.
that's when we met.
I need information about what I don't know.
that specializes in seismic infringement.
you're kidding.
what else does it say?
on what the media's calling
What?! So the other archer works for Merlyn?
he's tying up loose ends.
erasing all evidence this device exists so no one can trace the devastation back to him.
all right, so you're going to have a pointed conversation with Mr. Merlyn.
well, even if I take out Merlyn, the other archer is still out there.
he can set off the device. We need to find it.
then Merlyn can get his.
well, maybe there's another way to get Merlyn to tell us.
what do you have in mind?
"hacking" is such an ugly word.
stop!
I'll do it.
I knew your good judgment could be counted on.
come along now.
we need to get you back into uniform.
it's Fyers. It's happening.
understood.
that was Fyers.
everything is proceeding to your plan.
it truly is very kind of you to come all the way out here.
who are you speaking to
how are you?
well. Thank you.
actually, you look a little bit out of sorts.
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
Malcolm stopped by to check up on his nemesis.
on the racquetball court.
I didn't get a chance to talk to Walter at the hospital. Like everyone,
Yes.
I'll let you get some rest.
thanks again. Yeah.
uh, I'll walk you out.
well, now the police are focused on the copycat archer instead of the Undertaking. As for our collateral damage,
I had to limit our exposure. I see.
you held him for nearly six months.
surely you had him questioned. He was.
and I assume that if Walter knew something you'd rather he didn't, agreement be damned,
I would be a widow again. Am I wrong?
rarely.
well, we discovered a few phone calls
but naturally, they send down the one guy that's been working there 30 seconds and knows nothing.
I want them found as much as you do.
give me more to go on than some phone calls and I will help you in any way that I can.
thank you.
what are you doing here?
helping your father with an investigation.
call me if you need anything else.
thank you.
one second, sweetie.
you'll need a warrant.
no, we'll need a judge who owes me a favor.
you never did tell me what had you and Merlyn on the outs.
no, I didn't.
you don't have to tell me.
Oliver.
come on.
I know. I know. Say it.
you--you think I'm crazy.
I mean, Oliver, he cheated on me, he broke my heart, he led Sara to her death and you would probably rather drink acid than see me with him again.
dad...
I am sure you're disappointed in me.
since Queen's been back, he's...
different.
I'll deny ever having said that.
let's eat.
anything?
just for the record, I will pump my fist in the air and scream, "yes!" If I get in.
you know, you can just say this isn't working.
this isn't working.
all right, there has to be some other way we can find out where he's keeping this device.
unless I can waltz up to Merlyn's mainframe and plug in my tablet directly, there's no way of getting that location.
then we waltz.
excuse me?
you need direct access to the mainframe, so we get you direct access to the mainframe, and we figure out where the device is being kept.
Oliver...I did mention on the 25th floor?
it's only accessible through a restricted access elevator.
I know.
we're going to have to break in.
Hi. Oliver Queen.
I have an 11: 30 with Tommy Merlyn.
I have a super deluxe big Belly Buster for a Mr. Andrews. I think he's in security.
he a good tipper?
you can go on up, Mr. Queen.
you can wait a second.
new guy, you order food?
Yeah, I'm addicted to big belly burger.
never had it.
I'll split it with you.
keep the change.
hold that.
where you heading, sweetie?
19th floor.
too bad, I'm going to 13.
damn it!
Mr. Andrews got his lunch?
one belly buster with benzodiazepine. Hold the mayo.
sleep tight.
mainframe's on 25, guys. That's as close as I can get you.
come on.
don't look down.
too late.
I should mention, I'm afraid of heights, which I just learned.
Hey, Felicity. Hmm?
hold on to me tight.
I imagined you saying that under different circumstances.
very platonic... circumstances.
ready? Uh-huh.
you all right?
I'm fine.
Yeah, this is just my "about to hack" face.
I always... Oh, look like this right before I, you know, hack.
security patrol's on a ten minute cycle.
I'll have my meeting with Tommy and be back in nine, ok?
OK.
OK.
dig, you got eyes on her?
five by five.
OK.
sure beats the back of a bar.
I saw your name in my schedule,
I thought it must be a typo.
why so serious? Did someone decide that they didn't want you putting an arrow in them today?
I thought it was past time we talked.
about what?
me leaving the club, you being a serial killer?
we're not lacking for topics.
let's start with Laurel, since you're still in love with her.
so are you.
I can't be with her, Tommy.
you know why I can't.
so what?
I'm her consolation prize? I'll pass.
she's not anyone's...property.
laurel makes her own decisions.
and she chose you.
until you couldn't handle it.
lord knows I am guilty of a lot of things between us, but not you and her.
that's all I came to say.
what exactly do you do here?
I work closely with my father.
guys, you got trouble. What?!
Felicity's about to have some head of schedule company.
I'm not there yet on the download.
hold tight, I'm on my way.
Mr. Merlyn.
I must say, I'm surprised to see you here.
Tommy and I just had a little unfinished business.
Ahh. I know things have been challenging between you two, but I trust you're working things out.
Felicity! - Just a few more seconds.
Yes.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
there are some investors waiting for me back at the club.
I'm heading out to a meeting myself.
I'll walk you down to the lobby.
she's going to get made, Oliver.
Oliver, did you hear me?!
what? Just a few more seconds!
come on, come on, come on.
you don't have a few more seconds.
Yes! Wow, I really do do that.
damn it, Oliver, she's in trouble, where are you?
this is a restricted area.
let's see some I. D.
I. D? Um...
tell your mother I said hello.
I will.
got held up. Heading back upstairs.
what are you doing here?
I, uh, just saw Tommy.
Yeah, me, too.
I'm going to run back up, I don't want to be late.
Oh, I thought you just came down.
there you are!
thanks a lot, man, this one snuck past security.
one of Merlyn junior's bimbos.
she's pissed he never called her back.
copy that. I read the tabloids.
Yeah. Thanks again. Let's go, Barbie.
your new last name ain't going to be Merlyn.
but I love him! He's my man!
you're my knight in shining armor.
is that your friend Roy?
no, um... No?
Yeah, he gave me a ride.
Thea, what are you really doing here?
the truth, please.
the truth? Mm-hmm.
um...We're trying to find the Vigilante.
what?
Roy's been kind of obsessed with him since he saved his life at the subway.
and I overheard Detective Lance saying that the other archer was connected to Merlyn Global, so
Hey! Roy.
we haven't met. I'm Thea's disapproving older brother.
Yeah, I know. Good to meet you.
don't mess around with the Hood.
he's a psychopath, he's dangerous, and anyone who gets near him winds up dead.
that will not be my sister. Do you hear me?
OK.
take her home...now.
what are you doing?
the Vigilante's not too fond of guys who sell Vertigo.
I know a guy who claims he still has a stash to sell.
maybe we could stake him out, hope the Hood shows up for him.
did you not hear what my brother said?
what does your brother know about him?
uh, for one thing, the Vigilante once saved his life, so if he's telling us to keep away, that should say something.
no offense, Thea, but your brother's kind of a wimp.
don't say that. Why not? It's true.
my brother survived five years alone on an island!
five years I thought I had lost him.
yeah? Well, I lost someone, too.
and they aren't coming back.
who?
it doesn't matter.
that is why I need to find him.
so he can teach me to be like him.
I'm not losing anyone else ever again.
I can't do this, Roy.
if you don't give this up, you're going to lose me.
better now than later.
Oh, good.
I was just coming to check on you to see if maybe you'd like some tea, or...
what is this?
please.
divorce is an extreme reaction.
well, considering the circumstances,
I find it somewhat reserved.
or do you think I believe that my abduction on the night you told me that I was getting too close to your conspiracy was a coincidence.
you--you were in danger.
this arrangement, it saved your life.
well, that's ironic.
because it feels like you've destroyed it.
you know, I read about people in forced captivity.
some of them said it was a simple thought that got them through the isolation and fear
returning to their loved ones.
so I don't know really why I'm still alive, Moira, because I didn't have that.
Walter, please...
what do you think you can say to me to convince me that everything I knew, my whole life hasn't just evaporated?
where are you going?
come here.
detective?
What'd you find?
Merlyn Global's cyber security is off the charts.
firewalls, NSA-grade I. P.Sec protocols...
what's that, tech speak for "I struck out," boss.
Yeah, but I wasn't the only one.
somebody else tried hacking into Merlyn Global systems.
same pathways I used, same result.
you're saying that someone else was looking for Merlyn's connection to Unidac?
Yeah, someone good.
knew how to reverse engineer her footprints.
I almost didn't catch her. Her?
Yeah. She works at Queen Consolidated.
name's Felicity Smoak.
who the hell is Felicity Smoak?
in addition to the download, I also took the liberty of uploading a trojan to Merlyn's system.
figured it might come in handy.
that's smart. If Merlyn thinks he's been compromised, it'll help if we know first.
can you locate the seismic device?
I'm working on it.
but there's at least a terraflop of data to go through.
you all right?
my father, he told me that he failed the city.
asked me to right his wrongs, but I never knew what he meant until now.
it's the Undertaking.
I promised myself that when I crossed all these names off the list, I'd be done, but...
taking down these people, it doesn't honor him.
I was just treating the symptoms while the disease festered.
I stop the Undertaking...
I wipe out the disease.
what are you saying, Oliver? You would hang up the Hood?
Merlyn's plan is what I returned from the island to stop.
where are you going?
out.
Hi.
can we talk?
thank you.
what did you want to talk about?
wow, I thought this was going to be easier to say.
but now I'm standing here...
looking at you, and it's
just say what you have to say and go, ok?
ever since I've been back, we've been doing this dance.
we come together, and then I pull away.
something pulls me away.
but I think...
finally...
that something might be over.
what are you trying to say?
that...you know me better than anyone.
and that you are more important to me than anyone.
I just hope I didn't wait too long to say it.
you didn't.
you're right on time.
what is it?
felicity found the Markov device.
Merlyn's keeping it at a warehouse his company owns in the Glades.
good. Coordinate an attack.
you take the device, I'll take Merlyn.
got a location?
Yeah. According to Felicity's trojan, Merlyn's logged on to his computer from his office.
I'm on my way.
the uniform suits you, Yao Fei.
any time you're ready.
to the people of China and citizens of the world, I make this statement voluntarily, taking responsibility for the shooting of Ferris Air flight 637
to protest the People's Republic of China's treatment of me;
for betraying and abandoning me to the island of Lian Yu.
consider this my righteous delivery of powerful vengeance.
thank you.
No! Ba!
Ba! Sir.
plane is within range.
very well.
I'll be in touch.
can I help you?
no...
I wasn't talking to you.
you have failed this city.
and how have I done that?
the Undertaking, it ends now.
Oliver, the device...
it's gone.
Where's the device?
safe.
I don't know how you got that trojan onto my system, but it prompted me to take precautions.
there is nothing you can do to stop what is about to happen.
and you shouldn't.
this city needs what is about to happen in order to survive.
the people who are destroying it from the inside need to be erased from the map.
fine.
let's start with you.
ironic, isn't it?
last Christmas, I almost killed you.
a few months ago, you saved my life.
and now you're here trying to kill me.
you should make up your mind.
done.
Oh, no.
if I only knew how you were spending your nights.
why should I trust you?!
I thought it was past time we talked. About what?
you being a serial killer?
let's start with Laurel, since you're still in love with her. - So are you.
lord knows that I am guilty of a lot of things between us, but not you and her. She chose you.
my name is Moira Dearden Queen.
I have been complicit in an undertaking with one horrible purpose to destroy the Glades and everyone in it.
but you need to know that the architect of this nightmare is Malcolm Merlyn.
you can't beat me, Oliver,
is Laurel safe? - Yeah, you saved her.
no. Tommy...
it should have been me.
[Speaking Chinese]
this is the only seat with a seatbelt.
which will come in handy when we hit the water at 180 miles an hour.
which will not happen.
[Speaking Chinese]
I think that means we're here.
lian Yu.
but...you said the parachutes were just in case!
Yeah, just in case we made it here.
come on. - No!
all right, Felicity, on 3!
I can't, I'm scared! I can't -1!
thanks for waiting until we touched down.
my pleasure.
let's move.
what is it?
I thought I heard something. [Birds squawking]
don't move.
it's a landmine. I'm going to try to disarm it.
you can't!
Diggle! Walk away.
Felicity, don't move.
God, you're... you're really sweaty.
you're a hard man to find.
you shouldn't have come here.
would have emailed, but this isn't exactly a WiFi hotspot.
is this where you lived when you were here?
I mean, the first time you were here.
for some of it.
could you at least pretend like you're glad to see us?
dig and I spent weeks tracking you down.
we've traveled halfway across the world.
and this morning we flew in a plane so old,
I'm pretty sure I was safer once I jumped out of it.
you could...at least offer us a water.
or...
a coconut.
fresh out of coconuts.
I am happy to see you.
but I know why you're here.
I'm not coming back to Starling City.
I can't. My mission, my father's list, it was a fool's crusade.
and I failed.
Malcolm Merlyn destroyed the Glades.
Tommy died.
and the Hood couldn't stop it.
so don't ask me to put it on again.
ever.
this isn't about you being the Vigilante.
this is about you being Oliver Queen.
your mother's in prison, Oliver.
her trial's coming up.
Thea's out on her own.
your family needs you.
so does the family business.
all the bad press after the Undertaking
they've gutted every company they've taken over.
once they gobble up Queen Consolidated, 30, 000 employees are going to be out of a job.
including one very blond I. T. expert.
listen, I get why you had to leave, Oliver, probably better than anybody else.
I've been there.
and after what happened, nobody can blame you for leaving.
but it's time to come home.
you're not the first man to learn the hard way.
women are a distraction.
you've come very far in a few months.
don't beat yourself up.
Ah, apparently that's his job. And I love my job.
not that I wouldn't trade it for a way off this island.
while you two were playing with each other, I was hunting.
well, there's nothing more attractive than a woman who can hunt.
when I was marooned here, my first meal was a pheasant.
your father cooked it for me.
he was an awful cook. - Yeah.
but a great father.
I'm looking at the proof.
[Breaks neck] Let's eat.
what's that?
that's Fyers' proximity detector.
we salvaged it from the wreckage of the soldier's camp.
picks up anything moving outside our safe zone.
it's been five months since we stopped Fyers.
he and all of his men were dead.
so maybe it's an animal.
there's an imaging interface.
those are not animals.
and we're not alone on this island.
who's blood?
an alderman from the Glades trying to save the city.
fill your shoes.
here's everything on Stellmoor International.
the vice president of acquisitions is a woman named Isabel Rochev.
she looks angry in every photo.
so where to? Office?
home. I want to check in on Thea.
uh, she's not at your house, Oliver.
where is she?
I only have a second.
that's ok, my boss has been all over my ass today.
you should hear what she sounds like when
you have got to be kidding me!
come on! I don't want to fight.
clearly you do,
it's not like that. The Glades are worse than ever.
I know, but you already saved a busload of people and managed not to get buried alive.
I mean, how much more of a hero do you need to be?
it's like you have a death wish.
and guess what-- it's going to come true.
Yeah, well, someone has to do something.
and stand up for what's right, like he did.
the Vigilante.
who hasn't been seen since the earthquake, which means he did get buried alive and isn't coming back.
I'm back.
Ah, you remember my friend Roy.
still here? Always.
so how was Europe?
you never texted, no postcards.
almost like you're on the island all over again.
Yeah, sorry, I was kind of distracted.
with snow skiing, waterskiing.
a lot of skiing.
I hear rumors that my club is under new management.
Ah, actually, it's my club now, and you're not getting it back.
you're not old enough to drink.
but I am old enough to run a bar.
have you made it to Iron Heights?
to visit the woman who dropped a city on 500 innocent people? No, thank you.
Thea...That's not what mom did.
right.
she had no choice.
but guess what? She did.
a choice not to be a mass murderer.
and I have a choice, too.
so I choose not to be her daughter.
but I am so happy you are home.
honestly, I need to deal with our liquor distributor who shorted me on yesterday's delivery, and one of my bartenders called in sick, so...
what?
nothing. It's...
it's nice to see you like this.
like what?
together.
woman on TV: The representative from Central City says construction on the Star Labs particle accelerator should be completed by Christmas.
and in local news, billionaire Oliver Queen has returned once again to Starling City.
with his mother's upcoming trial and his father's company in freefall, analysts are asking what the Queen family scion has planned next.
wasn't our country founded on a brand of vigilantism, Mr. Donner?
the revolutionaries in the Boston Tea Party were certainly choosing justice over law.
I'd hardly compare our founding fathers to the Hood, Mr. Mayor, or these twisted copycats who have risen in his wake.
ms. Lance.
what do you think about vigilantes?
I'd be foolish to disagree with my new boss.
I knew I was smart to hire you.
I'd heard you joined the district attorney's office.
it was time for a change.
still, I'm sorry that you and your colleagues at CNRI won't be opening your doors again.
there were no doors left to be reopened.
they're playing my song.
good evening.
it has been a very difficult year for Starling City.
our losses have been incalculable, our grief unimaginable.
but with the generous donations you people are making tonight, we will come back from this tragedy.
man: You have failed this city, Mr. Mayor!
the Glades descended into hell on your watch!
you swore to protect all the citizens of Starling, not just the wealthy!
we're sorry about this, folks.
we'll have this sorted out in just a minute.
we are the Hoods.
and what was taken from us, we will take back.
dad, I'm fine.
you've got one very brave daughter there, sir.
Yeah, one daughter's right, and I can't stand to lose another.
well, I still can't believe this happened.
the hoods attacks have strictly been limited to people in the financial sector trying to redistribute wealth in the Glades at gunpoint.
Yeah, well, clearly that's not getting the result they're looking for, is it?
did you get a good look at any of them?
it was hard to focus on anything other than the gun barrel pointed at my face.
no tattoos, distinguishing marks?
what do you think you're doing?
interviewing the witness is the job of the Detective.
officer Lance.
this is my daughter. She was nearly killed tonight.
well, as a parent, you're welcome to stay.
but as a beat cop, you're more than free to go.
you know, that's one of the downsides of being demoted
I don't get to witness his sunny disposition on a daily basis.
dad, give me a sec.
Yeah.
I didn't know you were back in town.
I just got back a little while ago, and I was going to call, but then I saw you on TV, so I thought that I would come and make sure you were safe.
just four hooded gunmen.
nothing a few self-defense classes couldn't handle.
take a walk? -Yeah.
sorry I left.
believe me, I get it.
after the funeral, I think we both needed time to figure things out.
on our own.
I didn't get very far on my own.
did you?
figure anything out?
that I made a mistake...
when I slept with you.
I know it wasn't exactly cheating, because Tommy had broken up with me, but he only did that because he thought that you and I... should be together.
all I know is that I feel like I betrayed him.
and now he's gone.
and there's nothing I can do to make it right.
I know how that feels.
when I brought your sister on "the Queen's Gambit,
I betrayed you and your father.
there's no forgiveness for what I led Sara into.
I would give anything to...
to go back.
Yeah.
but we can't go back.
I don't like being played.
I'm not sure what you mean.
that's why you came to the island and brought me back to Starling City.
these hood copycats.
well, what if it was?
they're just doing what you did last year, terrorizing one-percenters into cleaning up their act.
except they don't have your restraint, Oliver.
or your honor.
I'm done being the Vigilante.
maybe this town still needs a vigilante.
now there's four of them. How's that working?
please take me home.
got a big day at the office tomorrow trying to save my family's company.
Absolutely.
Mr. Queen.
woman on TV: And in local news, billionaire Oliver Queen has returned once again to Starling City.
unbelievable.
we off the mayor on live TV, and what's the local news keep showing?
Oliver Queen. Why?
guess he's taking over the family business.
we've been going about this wrong.
what do you mean?- If we want real payback, we got to take the fight to the name that did this to us.
queen?
Yeah.
he's some useless brat.
[Laughs] The applied sciences division of Queen Consolidated built the earthquake generator.
if we want real justice...
then that family has to pay for the suffering it's caused us.
in full.
Hello, earth to Queen.
what, did you drop a Vertigo when I wasn't looking?
[Chuckles] I was just distracted.
about what your brother said, about your mom?
eavesdrop much? - Ah, what I lack in height,
I make up for in wicked good hearing.
[Chuckles] Well, don't keep me in suspense, Harper.
what's your take on the matter?
though, keep in mind, I do control your paycheck and your sex life.
[Chuckles] Well, both my parents weren't worth a damn, either of them.
you never talk about them.
you got nothing nice to say, right?
still, I'd be glad to see them and talk to them if I could.
but...
look, you already lost your dad.
your mom, she's still here, and I'm sure she'd love to see you.
I'm sure she's dying to.
just like a lot of mothers in the Glades who won't ever get to see their kids again...
because my mother helped kill them.
I'm not going to that prison.
it's the only way I know how to hurt her.
you might want to consider how much it's hurting you.
they're in the conference room. Just fyi, no one is eating the bagels.
Isabel Rochev. - Oliver Queen.
sorry I'm late. - For this meeting or a career in business?
I didn't realize hostile takeovers were filled with so much hostility.
not at all. I'm actually in quite a good mood.
Really? So destroying companies agrees with you? Winning agrees with me.
you haven't won yet.
since you majored in dropping out of college, let me put this in terms that are easy for you to understand.
you control 45% of Queen Consolidated stock.
I control 45%, leaving 10% outstanding.
but, in two days the board will release the final 10%.
and I'll buy it before you do.
with what money?
I doubt your trust fund is that large, and no angel investor will go near the company that build the machine that destroyed half the city.
companies rise and fall, Mr. Queen.
your company has fallen.
you failed this city.
pull back!
Oliver, go! Go, go, go, go!
careful. Go, go.
quick! They're getting away.
go! Move!
ms. Rochev, I'm sorry about this.
cause they were after you?
because what happens in this building is my responsibility.
only for the next 48 hours.
I still can't get used to you in that uniform, Detective Lance.
it's "Officer" now.
and I'm just glad it still fits.
they hurt you?
I'm ok.
you, uh, heard anything from our mutual friend lately?
Nope.
in fact...I keep waiting for him to show up.
you could have stopped those guys.
not without giving Isabel Rochev and the hoods a pretty good idea of what I'm capable of.
I think what Felicity's wondering is whether you avoided taking those hoods on.
and, Oliver, she's not the only one wondering.
but they came after you, Oliver.
you could have taken them out.
no, I couldn't, Diggle.
the body count.
since Tommy.
after he found out my secret, you know what Tommy called me?
a murderer.
he was right.
so don't.
it's not like you've killed every guy you've faced.
that is what kept me alive.
that's why I should have stayed on the island.
is that where you're going now?
the two of you won't help me save my family's company,
I'm going to talk to somebody who will.
well, someone's definitely out there.
they're moving closer.
where do you think you're going?
flanking position. They get the drop on you, you'll want some back-up. [Speaking Chinese]
[Speaking Chinese]
she's teaching you Chinese. How sweet.
I'm sure she'd be happy to teach you, too
Hey.
Hey.
I'm sorry I didn't make it here sooner.
Oh, no, no, no. Please, Oliver.
you don't have to.
you saved hundreds of lives.
and killed hundreds more.
including Tommy.
that was Malcolm.
your sister doesn't see it that way.
and, you know, my attorney is thrilled.
if my own daughter can't forgive me,
all right, enough of that.
how has it been going at Queen Consolidated?
Yes, we do get the news in here, Oliver.
right. You know,
I would have declared bankruptcy a year ago.
I don't know if I'll get to run it for long.
Stellmoor.
their VP is coming after us hard.
Isabel Rochev. - Yes.
do not trust that woman, Oliver. She is dangerous.
well, mom, everywhere I look, there are no good options.
I don't know what to do.
you don't have to do it yourself.
this is a family business.
[Scoffs] I love Thea.
I don't think that she wants anything to do with it.
I wasn't talking about Thea.
table seven needs bottle service, and I need a round of Martinis on the three top.
you go see your mom yet?
[Sighs] I thought about what you said.
And?
And...I'll go see her when you stop going out at night looking to clean up the streets.
what does one thing have to do with the other?
I guess they're both things that are never going to happen.
we're looking for Oliver Queen!
he's back in town. He owns this dump.
where can we find him?
OK, then plan B, I'm going to start shooting people
drop off, hero.
I'm just as happy to kill this Queen as her brother. Let's go!
Roy: One of the guys was missing a hand.
what's going on here?
mostly, anyway. He still had sutures.
excuse me. It was the hoods, again.
they came here looking for you, they took Thea instead.
Where?- I'm sorry.
I really tried to stop them, but I
we'll get your sister back.
I was going to check something downstairs.
I've made a few improvements down here.
we need to find these guys.
I've been trying, ever since you got back.
I figured you'd come around eventually.
I kept that.
I liked watching you do that.
Thea's boyfriend said one of them was missing part of his hand.
maybe a veteran?
check hospital records, any males that have had surgical amputations on their extremities.
cross-checking by race and age.
got one--Jeff Deveau. Caucasian, late thirties.
what else can you get on him?
ex-marine.
would explain how he can handle himself.
did he lose his hand overseas?
no. In the earthquake.
says here he and his wife
she didn't make it.
phone records, please. I want to know he's in contact with.
he's made a lot of calls to a church in the Glades.
something called Standing Strong.
it's a support group for those who lost loved ones in the quake.
great place to meet three other guys as angry as you, looking for a little payback.
get me an address, please.
you're going to need this.
I had it custom made.
how'd I do?
[Sighs] It's perfect.
you were right.
maybe there's another way.
they have my sister.
what other way is there?
what are you doing?- We need to save her.
listen, kid.
you are not the only one who cares for her.
but there's a lot of them. Wait for my signal.
man: Where are the graves?
where are the graves?
I don't know what you're talking about.
tell me.
Oliver, no!
so...
what do you want to do with her?
we could knock her out, drop her off somewhere.
come on. Why don't you just buy her a new pair of Pradas while you're at it?
she's seen our faces.
look, offing Oliver Queen's one thing, but his sister?
she's not much older than my sister was when she was killed in the earthquake.
your sister wasn't killed, she was murdered.
by her mother.
what we're doing here is justice, which makes us the heroes.
she didn't kill anybody.
my mother didn't kill anyone.
Malcolm Merlyn destroyed the Glades.
with mommy's help.
Merlyn killed my father.
she thought he'd kill my brother, too.
she was afraid of him.
she must have been so afraid.
just like my wife...
when our house collapsed on top of her.
get away from her!
let's go. Please!
move!
go, move! Please!
let...
her...
go.
you want to save her?
there was no justice for people like the Queens till you showed us how to get it.
you showed us.
go!
you shoot me, we both die.
you'll drop me anyway. [Groaning]
I know you. You're a killer.
keep it under 40 next time. Have a good evening.
do you know who they are?
I think the hoods gives me a pretty good idea.
bring them in.
where you been? Typically when I bring in guys that you've gone after, they're a little more dead.
I'm trying another way.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
I didn't know that you were here.
I was just...
I come here a lot.
I can go.
no, it's...
you don't have to. It's, uh...
Laurel, I understand.
after everything that's happened, I...
understand why we can't be together.
but I still need you in my life.
we've been through too much for it to be any other way.
I feel like I betrayed him, too.
before the Hood, we didn't have things like earthquake machines or copycat vigilantes
Malcolm killed Tommy.
he was killed in the crossfire between two archers.
and now that Malcolm's dead, there's only one archer left.
and I'm going to help my boss catch him.
that outfit, with your coloring
isn't that cruel and unusual punishment or something?
I've done my best to avoid mirrors in here.
so, I
how have you been?
don't worry about me. I want to hear about you.
how are you doing?
are you still seeing, uh
Roy was his name, wasn't it?
sweetheart, I'm fine, really.
it's not that.
I...[Sighs]
I almost died last night.
what?
Thea, what happened?
it doesn't matter.
but when I thought it was over,
I kept thinking that if...
if I died, you would spend the rest of your life thinking that...
I hated you.
and I want to hate you.
I really tried to.
but I can't.
I can't, Mom.
however long I am in this place, you have freed me.
if I hug you, are they going to shoot us?
I'm willing to risk it if you are.
you can't win this. I now own 50% of the stock.
by tomorrow, I'll have the outstanding five percent and I will control your company.
any attempt to fight me will lead to litigation and leave you penniless.
and trust me, poverty isn't as glamorous as Charles Dickens made it look.
what if I found someone to invest new equity capital?
a White Night?
with all due respect, your last name is now associated with mass murder.
even you don't have that good a friend.
you're right.
I have family.
Mr. Steel. It was my understanding that you had resigned as CEO.
I did. I'm now Chief Financial Officer of Starling National Bank.
and my institution has committed rescue financing to Mr. Queen.
we bought up the remaining shares of Queen Consolidated when they were released this morning.
now I know I majored in dropping out, but I'm pretty sure that makes us partners going forward.
so I guess...
we will be seeing a lot of each other.
you aren't at all what people say about you.
most people fail to see the real me.
thank you, Walter.
thank you, for reaching out to me.
whatever's happened between your mother and me,
I'm gratified that you know you can still count on me.
your father would have been very proud of you, Oliver.
ms. Smoak. Mr. Steel.
you did it.
not bad for someone who got a "D" in tenth grade Algebra.
if it's online, I can find it.
well, it was just like a good friend once told me...
I had to find another way.
we're not alone.
the question is, where did they come from?
Hey, what's up?
just came back from visiting my mom.
Really? Good for you.
so what do you say?
you ready to start spending your nights safe with me?
Absolutely.
Hey, I'm going to pick us up some big belly burger right now.
I'll see you later. Ok.
we just want to be friendly.
what, we scare you or something?
Yeah. I think you do.
me, though, not so much.
run.
where the hell did you come from?
well, it looks like Starling is back down to only one man in a hood.
and the three of us are back in the archery business?
no.
I spent the past year trying to avenge my father.
if we're going to do...this, it has to be about honoring Tommy.
I need to become the man he hoped I could be.
you two have helped me take the first step.
so what's step two?
I'm game for anything as long as it doesn't involve skydiving.
and I'm pretty down on landmines now, too.
the city still needs saving.
but not by the Hood.
and not by some vigilante who's just crossing names off a list.
it needs...
[Sighs] Something more.
it needs a hero, Oliver.
it's too bad the hoods kind of ruined your nickname.
no, it's good. I never...
I don't want to be called the Hood anymore.
OK.
so what do you want to be called?
my name is Oliver Queen.
after five years on a hellish island,
I have come home with only one goal...
to save my city.
but to do so, I can't be the killer I once was.
to honor my friend's memory, I must be someone else.
where the hell did you come from?
what do you think you're doing, Officer Lance?
this is my daughter.
she was nearly killed tonight.
well, as a parent, you're welcome to stay.
but as a beat cop, your more than free to go.
let me help you.
OK, you can help me.
to do what I do, I need intel.
you can be my eyes and ears in the Glades.
that's how you can save the city.
how do I contact you?
leave that in the alley wall, and I'll know to contact you.
I told you to stay away from me.
the copycats are still alive.
Tommy Merlyn isn't.
I lost a friend that day, too.
and I would gladly have given my life for his.
well, don't worry, your life is over.
your life as a free man.
put your weapon down.
I'm not your enemy.
then put your weapon down.
nice mask.
why'd you help me?
Oh, thank God.
police scanner's been blowing up for the past hour.
laurel called in half the force with that silent alarm.
Yeah, because going after actual bad guys is so last year.
to her, I am the bad guy.
since when?
since I didn't make it to Tommy in time.
how did you get out of there?
I had help from a masked blonde woman in black.
another copycat vigilante?
no. She was different.
trained, and she used a sonic ...thing.
wait, sonic thing?
could you be a bit more specific?
she turned it on and the glass shattered.
OK, well, who was she and why would she help you?
and how did she know to help you?
all good questions.
I don't like the idea of another player in town.
I'll see what I can find.
Oliver, what I would like to know is what you're doing at Laurel's office in the first place.
she makes you public enemy number one and you figure this is a good time to chat?
that I'm not the bad guy.
I was wrong.
wonderful.
now we have a dead Japanese soldier in our home.
those men on the island were looking for these corpses.
aren't you the least bit interested in why?
I'm more interested in how many more there are of them and where they're operating from.
they'll be coming for that, which means they'll be coming for us.
and as we've already seen, they're not the friendliest bunch.
it kind of looks like you've done that before.
back in Xingjian, I was pre-med.
she's a woman of many talents.
come on.
come on" where?
to higher ground.
we need to get to a vantage point where we can establish the enemy's position.
what about Shado?
I'll be fine here.
we shouldn't split up.
let her play with her corpse.
we'll be back before she knows it.
here you go, Bud.
on the house, Officer Lance.
Hey, no, no, no, here you go, a dog this delicious?
I'd have to book myself for robbery. Take it.
all right. - Take care.
all units, 1078 at Second and Fletcher. Please respond.
Lance, patrol Delta Charlie 52, 10-60, officer responding. Over.
negative, DC-52. Disregard 10-78 and resume patrol.
according to whose orders?
lieutenant Pike.
excuse me.
bill, what is going on here, huh?
this is my beat. Why did Pike wave me off of this?
Quentin, it's under control.
excuse me, what is under control?
that's Barton Mathis.
that seems to be what the M. O.indicates.
he's doing consecutive life sentences in Iron Heights.
not anymore.
the quake split open a section of Iron Heights.
Mathis was among the escapees.
the brass want to avoid a panic, so they're keeping it quiet.
are they keeping it quiet from me, too?
come on, man.
pike knows what happened to you last time. The man got in your head.
Yeah, and I caught him.
and no one knows Mathis better.
and I've got all your notes and your files.
pike's order.
if you go anywhere near this, he's going to have you arrested for obstruction.
I found a number of police reports from the last few months that may involve our mystery girl.
they describe a masked woman in black attacking attackers.
she put five would-be rapists in the hospital so far.
are you sure it's her?
broken limbs, ruptured ear drums ...
your sonic thing.
that's her.
she's targeting criminals.
misogynist criminals.
first the hoods, now her.
looks like you started a movement.
I don't want to start a movement, so we catch her.
I'm not letting the city get overrun with vigilantes.
Hi, Detective.
so ...
miss Smoak gives you a way to call me now.
she vouches for you.
and you told me that you're trying to help the city without dropping bodies.
that true?
what do you think?
let's just say I'm willing to be convinced.
this city is hurting.
and the police?
I always thought we didn't need to go outside of law to find justice.
but in light of recent events, I'm not so sure anymore.
the media calls him the Doll Maker.
cause he suffocates his victims with a flexible polymer that he pours down their throats and then he dresses them up like dolls.
I put him away.
because of the quake ...
he's out and he's killing again.
these are from six years ago.
that's my personal file.
maybe it's not just the file that's personal.
Mathis killed eight girls before I got him last time.
I don't want any more on my conscience.
so why don't you let the police do their job?
I could say the same thing to you.
they're spread so thin, they can't even risk letting the public know that Mathis is out.
you said you're trying another way?
maybe I am, too.
you have such beautiful skin.
Lance's file give you anything?
last time the Doll Maker was active in Starling City, he ramped up to one kill every three days.
that gives us two to catch him.
can we connect the victims?
young.
pretty.
according to Lance's file, he couldn't figure out how he chose them.
as if porcelain dolls weren't creepy enough all on their own.
Barton Mathis doesn't have any family or known acquaintances.
lone wolves are harder to catch.
but they do have the right to an attorney.
call Lance.
tell him to set up a meeting for tonight.
where?
at the office of whoever represented Barton Mathis.
so I'm assuming this takes priority over finding out the identity of your secret admirer.
I got that covered.
Hey. I was wondering when I was going to see you again.
there's someone new in town...a woman.
she's targeting men who target women.
I know.
I've seen her.
find her, but don't engage.
leave that to me.
the archer makes quite a mess.
I'll add that charge to the indictment.
well, you called it right.
he showed.
I know him pretty well.
at least better than others.
this place is a mess.
twice in three weeks, you're ducking bullets.
I'm fine.
you don't look fine. You look tired.
I think I'll give you two a moment.
did you just come here to tell me how tired I look?
no, I came here to check up on you and check up on some court records.
Barton Mathis is out.
I'm looking for his attorney.
Why?
you're no longer a detective.
Yeah, well, I'm just doing a little digging off the books.
dad, this case ...
it took you to such a dark place last time.
Yeah, well, I think we both know that it wasn't Mathis who did that.
look, nobody knows this guy better than me, which means nobody's got a better chance of stopping him, ok?
and that means every girl that he kills is like another one on my conscience.
no. No, dad, it's not.
whatever guilt you're feeling ...
you're just using it to justify a vendetta.
well, maybe I'm not the only one.
are you ok?
Oh, Thea, you have to stop asking me that every time you come to visit.
Ah, don't count on it.
well, then, I'm afraid you'll be asking me that for the next 25 years to life.
please don't talk like that.
Thea, there's not a lot of value in the power of positive thinking when you're being put on trial for mass murder.
let's just try to take things one step at a time, ok?
well, I'd have to check with my lawyer, but I don't think retail therapy is a viable legal strategy.
well, I spoke with her, and she said that you can wear regular clothes to your pre-trial hearing.
so I picked these.
I wish the fashion police was all I had to worry about.
please don't joke.
Thea, listen to me.
I need you to understand what's happening here.
503 people are dead and there is a measure of guilt that is owed me.
I'm ready to accept my punishment.
even if that means spending the rest of your life in here?
Yes.
help you with something, Officer?
according to the D. A.'s office, you handled his post-trial appeals, and I'd like to know where he is.
so you can give him a parking ticket or something?
if you want to talk to me about one of my clients, come back with a detective shield.Or a court order.
what, you find that funny?
well, a little bit.
where do we find him?
iron Heights prison.
he got out.
what? How?
you spent hours with him!
where would he run?
Where?! - I don't know, I...I swear!
what the hell are you doing?!
I thought you were done killing people!
he'll live.
Yeah, but he'll report me to my lieutenant!
he won't talk to anyone.
what makes you so sure?
because he has another shoulder.
Oh, ok, ok, ok!
there...there is another place.
he was always drawing it.
sketching.
his cell walls were covered with the place.
Yeah, well, what's the place?
was it in Starling City?
Yeah. The Bisque Museum.
he said the building reminded him of Germany.
where porcelain dolls were invented.
I'm sorry.
I guess he just gets enthusiastic sometimes.
the lady at the desk said a guy matching Mathis' description checked in last week, room 52.
and he paid in cash.
now listen, just we're so clear, when we go through that door, we're here to arrest Mathis, ok, not to torture him.
you asked for my help.
Yeah, and that wasn't either, and neither is aiding and abetting.
and I am still a police officer.
do you want to catch him or not?
let's go.
detective.
it's been too long.
Felicity, I need a trace.
on it.
you sick son of a bitch.
sick? I've never felt better.
fresh air agrees with me.
Yeah, well, don't get too used to it.
I caught you before.
it's just a matter of time before I do it again.
fair enough.
in the meantime, however, I have someone who'd like to say hello to you.
say hello, dear.
she's a little inarticulate.
she's done nothing to you.
please, don't hurt her, just let her go.
and allow her to wither away in a mediocre and forgettable life.
no. No, no, no, no, no.
she deserves so much better.
she deserves to see her beauty preserved.
Pristine.Forever.
don't worry.
I will turn her into something special.
pay attention, Detective.
what comes next is really quite exquisite.
the sound of an esophagus slowly hardening.
like a symphony.
we're trying, but he's blocked the skip trace.
Barton, don't do it.
I'm begging you, ok? Is that what you want?
I am begging you. Please, just stop!
it's for the world to enjoy.
after all ...
everyone loves a pretty doll.
the police found her body an hour ago.
does the new victim give us any forensics we can use?
CSI did a complete forensics work-up, but they sent everything out to a private lab.
can you get in?
no. They took their system offline.
it seems like someone hacked into a lot of police-related systems last year.
then we do it like we did the Merlyn job.
so glad you invited me to tag along.
tranq dart. He'll be out for 36 minutes.
Yeah, I remember.
you're up, Felicity.
so, this is what a typical night's like for you, huh?
just a little breaking and entering.
all right, I got toxicology first.
what are all these?
chemical ingredients of all the make-up found on the victims...skin cream, nail polish, lipstick.
wait, wait, wait, stop.
scroll back. Scroll back.
this one. Ethyl paraben. Sodium laureth sulphate.
I've seen this before.
it's skin cream.
forensics found traces of it on her fingers.
probably something she used before he grabbed her.
skin cream. Mermaid something.
one of the victims from his last run, she had this in her purse and I had the lab analyze it, and it's the same formula.
already on it.
how the hell could she do that?
ethyl paraben and sodium laureth sulphate is Mermaiden's proprietary formula.
two victims with the same taste in skin cream.
that can't be a coincidence.
I could never figure out how he chose his victims.
I think you just did.
we shouldn't have left Shado.
well, it's her life.
it's her choice.
you listen to my advice.
what advice?
to avoid attachment.
Yeah. That was bad advice.
but it will save your life.
maybe I don't want to live under those terms.
Yeah, well, maybe you're an idiot.
Hey, you think that carrying about people gets you killed.
I think it's what keeps people alive.
I was wrong about you.
you're definitely an idiot.
then that's who I am.
I'm not changing.
Ohh! You should be happy I haven't avoided attachment to you.
it's been a while, hoss.
I've been busy.
I can see that.
I'll give you a hundred.
four.
Two-five.
done.
if you throw in some information.
come on, man, you've got your finger on the pulse.
I'm looking for someone.
a blonde, likes black leather.
sounds like your type.
and beats the crap out of guys with a bow staff.
that still sounds like your type.
but I want to put eyes on her.
what do you know?
not much.
you know Cindy?
folks call her "Sin.
she's got short, spiky hair.
Yeah, I've seen her a couple times hanging around with your black leather girlfriend.
so where can I find sin?
well, she hangs out over at Fifth and Boyton.
and that is what I know.
so this is it.
skin cream, that's our lead?
it's something.
what do we know about the product?
it's made from crushed mother of pearl and it's super high-end.
only carried in a handful of boutiques and it's marketed for women with extremely delicate complexions.
he picks his victims for their skin.
the cream is how he finds them.
only four stores in the city carry it and three have surveillance systems.
I've ran facial recognition through all of them looking for Mathis, but come up empty.
he must be staking out the stores from the outside.
fine. So we'll do the same.
that could take days we don't have.
he's probably out there right now looking for another girl.
so that's what we give him.
I'll go to the stores that carry Mermaiden, and buy it in each one to cover our bases.
it's too dangerous.
more dangerous than going undercover in a mob casino or jumping out of a plane?
it's my life.
it's my choice.
there are only two ways onto this island... by sea, and by air.
so what, you're going to steal whatever they use to get onto the island?
well, I'm tired of living here, aren't you?
Oh, my God.
it appears to be two or three clicks offshore.
what the hell?
it's firing off its location.
the plane!
they must have found it.
kid!
left the last store.
you're going to reimburse me for these, right?
I saved my receipts.
go to the rendezvous point.
stay in public.
just for the record, I'm not a huge fan of dangling helpless girls in front of psychopaths like meat.
she volunteered.
well, she must really believe in you.
so did your daughter.
she suffered a loss.
grief's got a way of shifting a person's beliefs.
but then you know all about that.
you've lost people, too, right?
why would you say that?
why else would you be doing this?
my youngest, she died.
I'm sorry.
less than a month after it happened, I...
I ended up catching the Doll Maker case.
threw myself into it.
I think on some level, with each girl I was trying to save ...
and just like with Sara, I couldn't.
he killed eight girls Sara's age before I caught him.
someone's coming.
I got him.
OK, I'm going to admit to being seriously wigged out right now.
false alarm, but next time I offer to be bait for your serial killer, please turn me down.
delta Charlie 52 to Central.
code 99, possible 207 in progress, immediate back-up required!
you're all right, you're all right.
don't move.
she hit her head.
go, go, go.
I thought there'd be more ceremony to this moment.
I'm a little disappointed, to be honest.
get out of here!
officer Lance, SCPD.
it's Mathis. I almost had him.
search the area. Whole building.
sorry.
for what? - Pike's orders.
he wants you collared for obstruction.
what, he... Quentin Larry Lance, you have the right to remain silent.
if you give up that right to remain silent, anything you say can ...
they're charging Lance with obstruction.
he's in custody.
Mathis isn't.
he'll be looking for another target.
I hacked Mermaiden and sent out an email blast from their servers telling stores the product was defective.
that will slow them down.
smart. - What about Lance?
one legal problem at a time.
docket ending 4587, State versus Queen.
all right, I'll hear your motions, ladies first.
your Honor, we would like to be heard once again on the issue of bail.
ms. Queen has languished in the Iron Heights prison now for five months.
and in those five months, did the 503 people she's charged with killing miraculously return from the dead?
if not, I'm a little unclear on how the passage of time is relevant.
might I remind the court that the defendant is presumed innocent?
no need.
I want to law school.
it's where I learned that bail, once denied, cannot be set in the absence of change of circumstance.
Mr. Donner, what do you have for me?
your Honor, the State has no pre-trial motions to make at this time.
but we would like to serve notice to the defense pursuant to rule of criminal procedure 15.
your Honor, I would like to conference with the district attorney.
there's really no need, nor any obligation.
what about professional courtesy?
I would like to have a conversation with you before you seek the death penalty.
your client aided and abetted an act of mass murder.
503 conversations wouldn't convince me that Moira Queen shouldn't be the 504th fatality.
mom, we are going to fight this.
no one is going to take you from us.
we won't let it happen.
I had to call in a lot of favors to get those.
the only problem is that I've been at the D. A.'s office for less than a month, and no one owes me any favors.
so how did you get the charges dropped?
your friend Pike and I have been working together on the anti-vigilante taskforce.
do you remember?
hmm. Last year you were working with the Arrow.
what a difference a few months makes.
the Arrow?
Yeah. Seems more appropriate than the Hood.
and now you're working with him.
guess I'm not the only one in the Lance family that's done a 180.
this city needs help.
I just became less particular about where it comes from.
what's your excuse?
still Tommy?
what would you tell me if I said it is?
that a guy with a bow and arrow can't save a guy whose had a building fall on top of him.
what's going on with you is not about the Arrow.
then what is it, Dad?
I mean, why don't you tell me?
you seem to have all the answers.
that crack that you made about me feeling guilty about something.
Tommy's death.
why would I feel guilty about that?
I don't know. I wish I did.
cause it's eating you up.
your psychoanalysis would probably have a bit more credibility if it wasn't being offered under police custody.
Laurel, I'm worried about you...
I'd stay away from Pike if I were you, and the Doll Maker case.
excuse me.
step off, Abercrombie.
what do you want?
can't you see I'm busy?
I'm looking for a friend of yours.
blonde. Black leather, head to toe.
so I guess that's a yes.
he said he would go inside ...
that's what he said.
he said he would go inside.
you all right, pal?
need a doctor or something?
no. I'm fine, thanks.
I checked the order and you shorted us half a case of champagne.
I'm not paying for booze I didn't get.
that won't help.
Yeah, well, neither is yelling at my vendors, but ...
I want to yell at someone right now.
mom's going to be ok.
because we are going to help her fight this.
as a family.
they want to kill her.
I won't let them.
Thea, can you turn to channel 52, please?
officer Quentin Lance and his daughter Laurel were abducted earlier today.
no ransom has been demanded.
SCPD are urging anyone with information regarding their whereabouts ...
how did he get them?
I don't know about Laurel.
detective Lance was abducted from the precinct parking lot.
Mathis shot a guard on the way out, which sounded the alarm.
I pulled up the department's security camera footage, and a van from Metamorpho Chemical caught my eye.
Metamorpho was condemned after the quake.
perfect place to make some dolls.
not tonight.
cops will use tracers, Oliver, same as we did.
they won't make it in time.
Hey.
wake up, Abercrombie. - What?
did they send you?
did who what?
not my face!
I have a disapproving girlfriend.
are you one of them?
one of who?
that's mine.
let him go.
isn't this nice?
all of us here together.
it's like Thanksgiving.
Laurel, just stay calm. Stay calm.
Barton, I'm sorry.
I know you hate me.
I know you hate me, ok, and I understand that.
but you hate me.
so please let my daughter go.
now why would I do that?
look at her.
she's so lovely.
maybe a little too much melanin in the skin, but ...
it's the imperfections that make art sublime.
I am the one who put you away.
she had nothing to do with it!
she had everything to do with it!
she's your world, she's your very soul.
you know, I could kill you, I could maim you, I could slice you up into a thousand pieces, but if your soul remains intact, what have I done? Huh?
nothing.
I will kill you, you son of a bitch!
I will kill you!
you son of a bitch!
sweetheart ...
close your eyes.
I'm here.
I'm here, honey.
if you struggle, it will take longer.
do whatever you need to do, just get him.
get him!
let's take a better look at this face of yours.
you have such lovely skin.
you're going back to prison.
no, he's not.
it's ok, sweetheart.
it's ok, he saved us.
I know.
I know he did, and after I hunted him.
it's ok, it's all right.
no. He came.
he came to save me.
Yeah, I know, he saved us both.
no.
not him.
not the Arrow.
what?
Oliver, he... he told me to stay out of the Glades, and he...he told me to get out of CNRI, and I didn't.
Tommy was only there because I was too stubborn!
to stubborn to get out when I had the chance.
you were right.
I was blaming the Arrow because ...
Oh, my God.
it's all my fault, Dad.
it's all my fault that Tommy died.
it's all right, honey.
how is she?
she'll be all right.
in time.
I might not always agree with your methods, but I can't argue with your results.
you saved my daughter. Again.
she needed help.
and she wasn't the only one.
Thanks.
I know how hard this day has been for you.
Yes.
and believe it or not, I've actually been in worse situations.
listen to me.
Donner knows how strong our defense is.
don't let him scare you with that little death penalty stunt of his.
Oh, I'm not afraid of dying, Jean.
I've made my peace with this world a long time ago.
then it's win the case in the courtroom.
the trial is going to reveal that you were living under Malcolm Merlyn's thumb.
it's going to reveal everything.
Yes.
and that's what I'm afraid of.
Moira, what don't I know?
don't you do this. You need to tell me.
I am your lawyer, and I am also your friend.
Thea and Oliver.
I'm finally in a good place with my children, Jean.
I have my family back.
but there are some things ...
that must never be spoken of.
you shouldn't have come here.
I had no choice.
Ra's Al ghul has ordered your return.
I'm not going back. I can't.
that is not your decision.
tell them that you couldn't find me.
tell them I ran.
I won't lie for you.
fine.
don't tell them anything.
something's going on with this woman.
she keeps following you around, helping you out.
we've got to find her.
to stop her, or to send her a thank you note?
that depends.
on what?
what side she's on.
my name is Oliver Queen.
after five years on a hellish island,
I have come home with only one goal...
to save my city.
but to do so, I can't be the killer I once was.
to honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.
I must be something else.
time to choose, Oliver, who lives and who dies.
you got what you came for!
time's up. - No!
I guess you made your choice.
No!
ivo killed Shado because of me.
nothing good comes from telling Slade that you think you're responsible for the death of the woman he loved.
the man who killed Shado is still out there.
not for long.
because we're going to take the freighter.
we're all going to die here, just like him.
no, we're not.
I think I found our way on to the freighter.
a parachute.
I'd like you to meet Slade Wilson.
it's a pleasure to meet you...
Mr. Queen.
what are you doing here?
Mr. Wilson just made a sizeable contribution to my campaign.
how generous of him.
well, I felt compelled.
it was the least that I could do for your mother.
and what this city needs is a pro-business mayor like Moira to spread growth through urban investment.
and we were just discussing how to combat the rising wage gap.
and the answer lies in your budget proposal.
you know, when I look at your mother,
I think about everything that you went through after the quake.
all I can say is, you and I have something in common.
what's that?
I know how difficult it is to pick yourself back up when other people have written you off.
indeed.
what's wrong, Mr. Queen?
you look a little piqued.
I'm fine, thank you.
Ah, thank you, dear.
Oliver, Mr. Wilson was kind enough to bring a bottle of authentic Australian rum.
will you join us in a drink?
Yes, of course.
wonderful.
what shall we drink to?
to friendship.
Oh, delicious.
this here is a beautiful piece.
tell me, does your family spend much time on the water?
uh, no.
not since my late husband.
I'm sorry, Moira, forgive me.
I do remember reading about that accident in the paper.
you were a brave soul.
I don't like to talk about it.
I can understand.
all that time on that island...
it must have been hell for you.
Shado would be proud.
thank you.
but those trees don't move, or shoot back.
Ivo's men on the freighter will.
then shoot first.
Ivo's freighter is located here.
he keeps eight men on deck.
three on the starboard, three on the port and two up in the bridge.
do they have night vision?
not according to blondie.
that smells awful.
it'll taste even worse.
but it'll work?
I spent a year with Anthony Ivo.
I know how he thinks.
it'll work.
Hey, what about the Mirakuru?
well, what about it?
well, look, I mean, it can cure,
I don't know, maybe anything.
maybe...
maybe it's a miracle drug.
but it's also something else.
something that people like Ivo should never be allowed to control.
what about Slade?
he might not let us.
might not let you do what?
you think we should destroy the Mirakuru?
this thing doesn't go our way...
we can't let Ivo have it.
you're right.
we should burn it.
Anthony devoted his entire life to finding this.
nobody even thought it was real.
it was his dream.
did he ever say why?
he wanted to save the world.
we need to talk about tomorrow.
about what to do with Anthony once we take the freighter.
what do you mean?
because Slade wants to kill him.
I'm not going to let that happen.
no, Slade wants to kill him for Shado.
Oliver, you don't know him like do.
look, if he's given the chance, then he's going to turn this around.
he's going to make Slade think that it's your fault that she's dead.
that you chose to save me instead of her.
you can't give him that chance.
I can't.
you've killed before. - That's not what you are talking about.
you are talking about executing somebody in cold blood.
look, Slade has the Mirakuru in him.
he's unstable.
if he loses control; If he snaps again, then we're both dead.
you have to kill Ivo.
who's thirsty?
Where'd you get that?
who cares? Let's drink it.
ahh, this is one of the few precious pieces of cargo to survive the crash.
Billy Wintergreen and I were planning on saving it for a rainy day but considering, God willing, this is our last night on the island...
to taking the freighter.
to getting off this island forever.
to Shado.
you know, if something happens to me tomorrow...
you can't think like that.
if I don't make it...
I need you to...
to tell my mom and my sister
tell them I was different.
OK.
and if I don't make it...
tell my family that I died on "The Gambit.
Why?
let them remember me the way that I was.
we should all get some sleep.
I've missed you.
how are you still alive?
I'm not alive.
remember?
I'm dead.
because you chose Sara over me.
why didn't you choose me?
why didn't you choose me?
why didn't you choose me?!
rise and shine, kid.
it's time.
better luck next time, Hendrik.
you cheat!
he cheats!
so do you.
he just cheats better.
get up, preacher boy.
I said get up, coward!
ivo wants to see you.
have faith, my friend.
God will protect you.
there is no God.
if there was...
he's not on this ship.
how is she?
I'm sorry, Anthony.
I wish I had better news to give you, but her condition is progressing quicker than we anticipated.
have you tried upping her dosage?
twice already, but we both know modern medicine has its limitations.
Oh, yes, I know quite well.
thank you, Doctor.
no, wait.
wait, Mr. Ivo.
my family is Bratva.
russian mafia.
they pay millions for me.
I'm sorry, I have very little use for money.
I do, however, require an eye for my research.
well, we don't have all day.
there's a breeze.
they're on the beach.
take them.
alive.
what about him?
they're coming.
two men, armed.
you know, when we first tried to get off this island, it was as strangers.
but now it's as brothers.
see you on the freighter.
right over there.
you're lucky Ivo wants you alive.
I told you I'd come back.
fantastic.
we're saved.
he likes you.
don't worry, he won't bite.
this is Abraham.
I remember you from before.
you escaped.
with that blonde whore.
that's Hendrik.
he's a charmer.
Yeah, I hope she rots in hell.
Hey, Sara was a prisoner, just like all of us.
right.
funny, I never heard her scream.
how long have you been here, Thomas?
a little over a year.
I was working as a missionary in Maliku, just off the coast of India.
this ship docked there for supplies,
Dr. Ivo asked me to come aboard to administer last rites for a dying man.
my mistake.
I'm sorry.
don't be.
can you imagine a better place for a man in my line of work?
Mr. Queen.
welcome back.
my men are still searching the beach for your friend and Sara.
they have the Mirakuru.
so...
where are they?
go to hell.
maybe you'd like to rethink that.
you torture me all you want to.
I am never going to tell you where they are.
not willingly.
what is that?
Oh, this?
see, this is sodium pentothal.
its more colloquial, yet very descriptive name, is truth serum.
no, wait, wait!
no, no, I'll tell you everything!
let's begin.
are you married, Mr. Wilson?
do you have any children?
sadly neither.
well, there must be someone special in your life.
there was.
but she passed away a few years ago.
I'm sorry.
my mother and I have had to deal with a lot of loss, unfortunately.
and eventually we learned...
that you just have to move on.
I don't believe that.
you know, I heard that your family has an affinity with the fine arts.
Yes, my husband amassed quite the collection of 19th century American landscapes.
hmm. I'd love to see them.
maybe another day.
we have some family business that we need to discuss right now.
I'm sorry.
my son seems to have forgotten all his manners.
let me just get my staff to open up the rest of the house.
thank you.
mom?
not yet, kid.
I'm still going to meet the rest of your family.
Hello?
Hey, Ollie, have you and mom talked,'cause this whole not speaking thing...
Thea, now is not a good time.
who's your friend?
it's a pleasure to meet you.
about me.
Thea, what perfect timing.
this is Slade Wilson, and I...
they've met.
...was just about to show him our collection.
but you're far better suited. Come.
senior year, I was obsessed with art.
my teacher made me bring my entire art history class over here to show our pieces.
it was exactly as mortifying as it sounds.
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.
but you're a very lucky girl to have known such privilege.
and I am fortunate to have your entire family here.
Oliver, what's your name?
Oliver, where were you born?
Starling City.
why did you build a bonfire on the beach?
so you'd see it.
I told you.
was the bonfire a trap?
not a trap.
it was a...
a distraction.
how was the bonfire a distraction?
where are Sara and Slade right now?
where are they?!
they're on the freighter.
where on the freighter?
they're in the engine room because we have a raft.
sound the alarm.
I want every man on this freighter down in that engine room.
search the entire floor.
it'll taste even worse.
but it'll work?
I spent a year with Anthony Ivo.
I know how he thinks.
it'll work.
what is it, exactly?
Cocculus indicus.
it's a natural source of picrotoxin, which will counteract effects of barbiturates...
like sodium pentothal.
Ivo's favorite.
but you still got to act stoned to sell it.
lucky for me.
before all this, I had a lot of practice.
they're clearing the decks.
the top of the ship's emptying.
are you ready?
you really don't want an honest answer to that.
but you've done this before, right?
nobody's done this before!
here, I think these belong to you.
we're on a clock, and she needs to free the prisoners.
ivo sent his men to the engine room just like we planned.
more convenient for me to take them out.
go find Ivo.
he can't get off this ship.
but don't kill him.
son of a bitch is mine.
and here we have a Curtis Swan from 1882.
fun fact about this one - he actually painted it with his left hand due to severe arthritis.
it's absolutely exquisite.
I know.
I can't tell you how many offers we've had from private collectors for it.
but it was one of dad's favorites.
wasn't it, Ollie?
Yes, it was.
he loved that one.
then you must never sell it.
I believe that when we lose someone we love, we have the obligation to honor their memory.
I think eventually I'd hit something.
be patient.
Ollie makes it look easy.
is anyone going to get that?
I'll take that as no.
no worries.
no matter where I go, I'm just answering phones.
Hello?
well, I do think we have been butt dialed.
and here is a Joseph Cooper from 1890.
Hey, that's Thea.
that's gorgeous.
wait, hold on.
I know that voice.
I actually have a painting from his first solo exhibition in Boston.
Oh, God, no.
who is that?
his name is Slade Wilson.
and unless we stop him, he's going to kill Oliver and his entire family.
we have to move.
now.
are you sure it was Slade Wilson?
I thought he was dead.
I'm sure.
that's not a voice I'd ever forget.
what's the biggest gun you got down here?
that might work.
might?
he has the Mirakuru in him.
so do I.
can I trust you?
I'll be fine.
Slade was a trained killer even before he was injected.
you get the chance, you get a shot, you put him down.
please save Oliver.
why are you doing this?
I'm with Oliver now.
why should I believe you?
because you don't want to die!
you helped that maniac torture us.
follow me.
Where's Ivo?!
he's heading to the bridge!
answer the phone.
Hello?
Jessica, it's me.
who?
it's Anthony.
I was married to a boy named Anthony.
I know, sweetheart.
but he went away.
I went to find a cure.
and I found one, sweetheart.
I found it, and soon, we're going to be...
he was a doctor, but he went away.
it's harder than it looks, isn't it?
killing an unarmed man.
it seemed pretty easy when you murdered Shado.
I didn't murder her, Oliver.
ivo, you shot her in the head!
I gave you a choice!
you chose Sara.
you blame me, but that's because you can't face your own guilt I loaded the bullets, yes, I pulled the trigger.
but you...
you aimed the gun.
and you hold yourself responsible.
don't you?
Yes.
but that doesn't mean I won't kill you.
the question is...
what will he do?
is it true?
tell me.
Slade, I tried to tell you...
tell him, Oliver.
I was angry, like you are right now.
and I wasn't thinking clearly.
shut up!
I acted rashly; I told him to choose between Shado and Sara.
don't listen to him.
he's a monster, he will say anything.
you know that he will!
tell him I'm lying, Oliver.
say it.
I can explain...
you've known...
please...
he's dead.
as dead as you are.
how many?
this one time, you can pray for me.
behind you!
are you ok?
Where's Slade?
he knows!
we've got to get off this ship!
No!
Ollie, it's over!
it's over!
we've got to go!
we can still swim back to the island.
she's right!
we must hurry!
Slade, wait...
stop.
don't move.
get in the cell.
I do not take orders from you.
I am this ship's Captain.
not anymore.
this is my ship now.
any objections?
Slade Wilson is dangerous.
no chances, no mistakes.
I'm in position.
when Slade comes out, I'll have the shot.
thermal imaging's coming up now.
they're in the northwest hall.
Roy, remember, just get Thea and Moira away from Slade.
don't start a fight, you'll lose.
OK?
OK.
let's go.
thank you again for such a wonderful and insightful tour.
you were a remarkable guide.
did you have a favorite?
I found "The Promise" to be particularly compelling.
Thea, you home?
I thought I was meeting you at Verdant.
Oh, yeah.
uh, this is, uh...
I'm Roy Harper.
that's a particularly firm handshake you have there, son.
Yeah, you, too.
there you are.
Sara, we didn't hear you come in.
I didn't want to interrupt the tour.
Mr. Wilson, this is my son's friend Sara Lance.
of course.
you're the girl who came back from the dead.
Ah, we're just glad to have her home.
well, I can see.
I mean, it's hard to find that special someone who means everything to you.
you were very lucky.
what would you like to do now?
Mr. Wilson.
well, I'd hate to break up the party...
but I think I should be going.
I look forward to seeing more of you, Moira.
and your lovely family.
Dig's got a shot lined up outside.
Mr. Wilson.
may I walk you to your car?
Cyrus gold, the men in the skull mask, all this was you.
they worked for you.
well, I have my allies, just as you have yours.
John Diggle, for example.
I suppose you're wondering why he hasn't taken his head shot.
don't worry.
he's still alive...for now.
five years ago, I made you a promise.
do you remember?
well, I'm here to fulfill it.
I'll see you around, kid.
we made it!
Where's Oliver?
I need you to see something.
OK.
wait.
you need me.
OK, you have the Mirakuru in you.
not just in me.
you burned a box full of dirt.
I can help you understand how it works.
I've spent my entire life studying it, all right?
it was you.
you were the one who killed Shado.
no, he chose.
it was him.
give him your gun.
take it.
and show me...
how you killed Shado.
show me!
this isn't you.
it's the Mirakuru.
and you're sick!
I don't care.
I was trying to protect Sara.
but I didn't want Shado to die.
I cared for her, too.
you know that I did!
I don't care.
you said we were brothers.
you said that.
is that how you did it?
is that how you pointed the gun at her?
Yes.
get him out of here.
why don't you just kill me?
to kill you now...
would be a mercy.
you cannot die until you have suffered...
the same way that I have suffered.
till you have known complete despair.
and you will.
I promise.
Mr. Wilson leave?
Yeah.
it's getting pretty late, I'm going to go, too.
I know you and I have our differences, but they hardly excuse your behavior tonight.
if this is the way you're going to act around me from now on, then don't come by the house anymore.
my name is Oliver Queen.
after five years on a hellish island,
I have come home with only one goal to save my city.
but to do so, I can't be the killer I once was.
to honor my friend's memory, I must be someone else.
I must be something else.
there's a new player we've been tracking.
we've been calling him...Deathstroke.
I have a proposal for you men.
Roy was injected with the serum.
he's alive.
but we are going to have to keep an eye on him.
stay away from Thea.
no.
she's not safe when she's around you.
you love her, and that's why you're going to do what I'm asking.
how could you not tell me
Malcolm Merlyn was my father?!
I believed in you.
as of 30 minutes ago, your company belongs to me.
Slade. You're working for him.
I know Oliver Queen is the Arrow.
I don't think my eye holes line up properly.
is anyone else having this problem?
don't be nervous. - I'm a lot nervous.
this is a big move, even for us.
and we've cornered the market on big moves.
Slade didn't give us any choice.
Yeah, as far as plans go, this is not a good one.
Felicity. This was your plan.
I didn't think you'd actually say yes.
we're here.
Hey! That man used to work for me.
and how he works for our enemy.
security cameras are down.
you all remember the skeleton key?
courtesy of William Tockman, aka the Clock King.
it can open any lock. Including this one.
this is where we met Barry.
these are plug and play.
fasten them to what we talked about.
let the C4 do the rest.
been a while since I've blown anything up.
quick and clean.
I'm a bomber. I can't believe I'm a bomber.
I wonder if I can list that on my resume under special skills.
Freeze!
we have to go.
thermal shows everybody's out.
it's just a building, Oliver.
cowards.
who else would needlessly destroy cutting edge, scientific and medical technology whose sole purpose is to make Starling City a healthier and safer place?
as CEO of Queen Consolidated,
I have a message to the terrorist who committed this unspeakable act.
you will be caught, and punished.
for the record, I hated her before we found out she was a super villain.
OK. Slade's goal is to create an army of human weapons using the Mirakuru.
to do that, he needs an industrial centrifuge.
which having Isabel Rochev steal Queen Consolidated from your family gave him full access to.
but since Applied Sciences went kaboom, he can't use our technology...
well, formerly our for his warped science experiments.
Slade has had us on our heels for weeks.
it's about time we took the fight to him.
all this will do is set him back.
we have no way of knowing where the next attack is coming from.
look, you need to drop this, ok?
I'm fine. Really.
how is any of this fine?
look, you need to concentrate on you.
now listen, are you going to your meetings?
Yes. It's where I talk about how my father's facing prison.
Laurel...
this will all blow over, ok? Please.
no. It won't, Dad.
you were caught aiding and abetting the Vigilante.
working with him last year cost you your detective shield.
now, it can cost you 18 months in prison.
they want his name.
do you know who the Arrow is?
I don't.
I swear.
OK, well, what about the woman in black?
the one the Arrow works with?
do you know who she is?
no.
well, you must have some idea.
honey, I can't tell you what I don't know.
time's up.
you girls, you take care of each other.
do you really think he doesn't know who the Arrow is?
it's not like dad to lie.
sometimes it's people closest to us who lie to us best.
where is Thea?
she should be here for this, too.
I doubt she's coming.
well, I can't lie to either of you...
it's bad.
if Isabel Rochev is one thing, it's thorough.
she's been laying the foundation for this takeover for months.
but we still own a majority of stock in the company, correct?
Yes, but Isabel has diluted that stock to the point where it's worthless.
on paper, you're virtually broke.
and what's the good news?
we can protect your assets.
we need to move everything into a new trust that Isabel can't touch.
all I need is the beneficiaries from the current trust to approve the transfer.
the two of you and Thea.
Thea needs to sign off.
Yes. And quickly.
thank you, Ned.
well, now I have to become mayor.
it seems I'll need the income.
losing the company wasn't your fault.
it was mine.
I let Isabel Rochev get the better of me.
no. You always see the good in people, even if they don't deserve it.
I know that better than most.
Isabel is a vindictive woman.
she would have done this with or without your trust.
how do you know?
you told me months ago I couldn't trust her.
your father had a weakness for beautiful, strong women.
they were together?
Yes.
she was still in business school at the time.
the pretty intern that caught the CEO's eye.
all right.
you take this to Thea, and you convince her, somehow, to help us fight back.
Hey. Will you help me up?
Yeah.
just to my trunk.
OK.
Ohh, look who's up.
just in time for all the fun.
what are you going to do to him?
make him scream.
just like he made us.
hmm?
they say living well is best revenge? Ha.
I prefer torture.
you want first turn?
no. - Please.
I can help you.
no, doctor. I can help you.
what was it you said you needed for research?
an eye?
No!
let me get you a fresh one.
you can still stop Slade Wilson!
Anatoly. Wait.
what did you say?
I can help you stop him.
how? That miracle drug of yours has turned him into monster.
I know. I can turn him back.
ivo, what are you saying?!
the Mirakuru.
there's a cure.
Hey.
Hey, is Thea here?
no, I haven't seen her.
how's your dad?
he's willing to go to jail for the Arrow.
I know you said you weren't worried, but Dig and I went to Roy's apartment.
it's empty.
seems like he cleared out a few days ago.
where the hell did he go?
Roy will have to wait.
all right, we need to deal with Slade, figure out what his next move is.
I know Slade.
he is not going to stop till...
welcome home.
Aah!
Hello, Sara.
Diggle, stay back!
you're wasting your bullets.
Aaah!
don't forget who taught you how to fight, kid.
excuse me, I'm looking for my sister, Sara Lance.
excuse me.
I'm Laurel Lance. Is my sister ok?
Oh, she'll be fine.
just a hairline fracture of her wrist.
we set it.
she's got some nasty bruises; Looks worse than it is.
thank you. - Nothing compared to her previous injuries.
Previous...Injuries?
Yes, your sister has extensive scar tissue over her entire body.
the last person I saw with that much damage was a veteran injured in Iraq.
has your sister served in the military?
no.
no, she hasn't.
Sara.
Hey. - What happened to you?
Oh, I'm fine.
Ollie and I just had a little motorcycle mishap.
it was nothing.
I already got my discharge papers.
but your back...
those scars, where did you get them?
you ok?
I will be. - You?
Yeah. Hi.
Hi. So tell me what happened.
motorcycle accident. It was stupid.
we were making a left turn, this car ran a red light.
did you file a police report?
we didn't see the point. We're both fine.
that's... that's what counts, right?
right.
I should really go.
I have a deposition in an hour.
OK.
thanks for checking up on me.
always.
I know Oliver Queen is the Arrow.
Hey.
we missed you yesterday.
the meeting with Ned Foster.
Thea, I know that you're mad at mom and me, but we may have found a way out of this financial mess where we aren't going to lose everything.
mom and I both signed, we just...
we need your signature, and hopefully we can stop Isabel from ruining us.
after you let her ruin us, you mean?
Yeah.
it says Thea Queen here.
who's she?
that's you, Speedy.
no, it's not.
robert Queen wasn't my father.
Malcolm Merlyn was.
Thea Merlyn.
kind of has a nice ring to it.
Merlyn was your biological father, but Dad raised you.
only because he didn't know I wasn't his.
Hey, hey!
he...he loved you.
so do I, and I am still your brother.
no, you're not. You're my half brother.
and you know who else was my half brother?
Tommy.
Tommy, who I tried to kiss.
I tried to kiss my half brother...
before my real father killed him!
that's how screwed up I am!
and you know the sad part, I was actually starting to be in a good place.
I had the club, I had Roy, I had a brother who wasn't lying to me.
and for the first time in my crazy life, everything didn't seem so completely and totally messed up.
I thought I was going to be ok.
I'm so stupid.
you're not stupid.
no, what I am... Is the daughter of two mass murderers.
not one, but two.
so let's face it, Ollie.
I was never going to be ok.
it's not in my genes.
Thea...
we need to discuss that security matter now.
what do we have?
what Slade took. - Took?
he wasn't here to kill us.
he was here because we had something that he wanted. The skeleton key.
I did a full sweep.
it's the only thing that's missing.
he needs a new way to mass produce the serum now that we've dusted Applied Sciences.
with the skeleton key, he can get into anywhere and take anything he wants.
we know what he wants.
we just need to find it first.
where is the most cutting edge technology housed in Starling City?
the combined inventory of every scientist who ever worked at S. T.A. R. Labs.
all housed right in here.
I hereby christen this building "da bomb.
nobody says that anymore.
I say it.
I define my own cool.
I still can't believe Dr. Wells is shutting this place down.
s. T.A. R. Labs blew a hole in Central City when we turned the particle accelerator on.
it's not surprising that Starling City cancelled the lease on this facility.
we're not exactly the poster children for "let us store our unregulated prototypes in your neighborhood.
it was an accident, Caitlin.
Yeah, well, try telling that to the families of the people who died.
maybe you can figure out how to tell that to yourself.
look, Cisco, let's get this inventory done so we can go home.
I thought we were the only ones here...
maybe it's one of the security guards.
Oh. Hey, man.
we should be wrapped up any minute now.
are you getting a bad vibe off this guy?
the longer you make me chase you, the slower I will kill you.
help me.
this equipment belonged to Arthur Light.
wells fired him two years ago. - Why?
because he was a psycho.
please tell me you can make this work.
I take back what I said
I'll make this quick.
No!
Aaah!
we're too late.
Felicity! - Cisco, Caitlin!
are you guys ok? He didn't hurt you, did he?
you said "he" twice.
do you know who attacked us?
that lunatic with the mask and the sword?
uh, no. I... no, I don't know.
I... I said "he" twice, because on the radio,
I heard that the person who attacked you had man parts, which would make him a...He.
I'm John Diggle,
I work security for Queen Consolidated.
do you have any idea what the masked man may have taken?
an industrial centrifuge, by any chance?
no. It's a secret.
what kind of secret? - The kind I have to keep.
well, does Cisco have to keep it, too?
Yes. He does. -Ok.
we're just so happy that you guys are ok.
how's Barry doing?
he's the same.
Barry's condition deteriorated.
they moved him to S. T.A. R. Labs.
they've been looking after him.
that's how I met Cisco and Caitlin. - Right.
well, I'll come visit again, as soon as I can.
that would be cool.
don't worry, Barry gets lots of visitors.
iris is there a lot.
iris?
she's, um, his...
something.
Oh.
sure.
good.
that's just swell.
Barry's in a coma and he's already moved on.
I hacked into Harrison Wells' personal files.
he's the director S. T.A. R. Labs, which basically makes me unstoppable.
and look what I found.
it's a prototype for one of their new bio-tech projects.
the patent is still pending, which is probably why they didn't want to tell us what it was.
so what is it?
it's a biotransfuser.
it can deliver blood from one single patient into multiple patients, at once.
why would Slade need a blood transfusion?
he doesn't.
the prisoners that he freed from Iron Heights last week to create his own personal army do.
with a few tweaks, Slade can retro-fit it for the Mirakuru, by passing what we know to be a less than desirable ratio of success to, you know, death.
instead of it metabolizing in the person, it happens in the machine.
that's going to require a whole lot of blood.
even a man with Slade's stamina can't handle that kind of drain.
good. - What do you mean?
we let him use it.
he'll be weak, vulnerable, and that will be my opportunity to kill him.
how do we find this thing?
a machine like this pulls an exorbitant amount of power from the grid.
when it turns on, I'll know when and where.
right now, we just wait.
I'm tired of waiting.
don't listen to him, he's lying!
the cure is real, I promise!
no, he's just trying to save his neck.
Anthony, look at me.
tell us about the cure.
I want to help you, Sara. But first, you have to promise you'll help me, too.
she can't save your life.
no one can, not anymore.
all I ask is for is a quick death.
you don't deserve a quick death.
I know.
and I'm still asking.
it's your call.
thank you.
start talking, Ivo!
I was never able to replicate the Mirakuru serum from the original Japanese World War II research I discovered.
after conducting experiments on the prisoners that I acquired this past year,
I was able to synthesize a solution that counteracts, reverses the physiological effects that exposure to Mirakuru produces.
from more than human back to human.
where is this cure now?
you'll keep your word about ending my life?
Yes. Tell us.
on the freighter.
in the safe in my quarters.
now I believe...
this concludes my end of our deal.
whatever you came here to say, it takes security about 60 seconds to reach this floor, so I would start talking.
Where's Slade?
I just wanted to give you the chance to do the right thing.
I'm under 30, and I'm the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.
I'd say I've already done the right thing.
and do you even know who Slade Wilson is?
or why he's doing this?
I don't care.
I got what I earned. - What you earned?
you think that sleeping with my father entitles you to my family's company?
you have no idea what you're talking about.
wow, he fooled around with a lot of girls.
I don't see any of them ordering hostile takeovers.
fooled around? - Yeah.
is that what your mother told you?
of course she would write me off as a meaningless affair.
Slade Wilson put me through hell.
his training nearly killed me.
would I put myself through all that just because I was a jilted lover?
honestly, I don't know what you are!
I was your father's soul mate.
he was going to leave your mother, leave the company, leave you.
our bags were packed. - Really?
your sister had to go and break her arm doing something ridiculous, no doubt.
she fell off her horse.
we were at the airport when he got the call.
I begged him not to go.
I reminded him that Thea wasn't even his.
are you saying that my father knew?
of course he knew.
he was a fool, not an idiot.
and like a fool, he loved her anyway.
he promised me that we would leave the next day.
but instead, my internship was terminated and he never spoke to me again.
Oh, so that's what this is really about.
he chose us over you.
please escort Mr. Queen off the premises.
don't touch me.
he's no longer welcome in this building.
my building.
Hello?
Thea, it's Ollie. Listen, I just need five minutes face to face.
what do you want?
there's something you need to hear.
five minutes. Come by the club after we close.
just spoke with Felicity.
someone reached out to the Arrow.
wants a meeting.
who?
Laurel.
you comfortable in there, officer Lance?
I can see if there's an extra blanket if you're cold.
Nah, I'm good. But hey, now that I'm on this side of the bars,
I think it's just Quentin.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
you'll be out of here soon.
Yeah, I appreciate your optimism.
Hey, what are you doing?
officer! We need help! We need help!
whoa, whoa, what are you doing, man?
remember me?
you should, 'cause I remember you, Officer.
no, you can't do this.
Aahh! - All right, take it easy.
cause you and that hooded freak show are the reason I'm in this place.
I thought I should be the one to welcome you.
this isn't over!
this is not over!
I heard about your father being arrested.
if I could help him, I would.
that's not what this is about.
it's funny, isn't?
a year ago, he thought you were a murderer.
and me, I was... I was drawn to you.
I couldn't explain why, but...
but a part of me felt connected to you.
you were always there.
for me...for my family, and for some reason, I never asked why.
are you asking now?
I don't have to.
because I already know the answer.
Hello? - Laurel...
it's Dad.
what is it?
Laurel, I am so sorry.
we had your father under protective custody.
there's no such as thing as protective custody in Iron Heights.
dad!
Hey.
it's all right, sweetheart, it's all right.
Hey, whoa, don't touch the ribs!
the ribs.
I'm getting tired of visiting my family members in a hospital.
what happened?
Oh, it's just some old collar paid me a visit.
I guess I'm not the most popular guy in prison.
Sara, do you mind giving Dad and I a second alone, please?
Yeah, of course.
I'll be right outside.
don't go far, sweetie.
dad...
what is it, honey?
I have to tell you something. - What is it?
I know who the Arrow is.
what?
don't say another word.
don't say anything.
OK.
listen to me, there was a time when I would have sold out my badge to find out his name. You know that.
but then I realize I didn't care who he was.
in fact, I didn't even want to know who he was.
why not?
cause I knew if I knew who he really was, then he'd become a person, right?
maybe he's got a family, friends, people that care about him.
someone with a life.
that he couldn't be what I needed him to be.
what this city needs him to be.
it's the Arrow that matters.
the man under the hood isn't important.
can you imagine what it's like to be him?
what he has to live with day in and day out, what that's got to be like.
Hey. The least I can do is sit here and do a little bit of time for him.
how's your father?
he'll be better once you drop all charges and sign his release papers.
he is facing 18 months.
Yes. But he is not going to stay here another day unless you want me to resign and embark on an exciting new career as a criminal defense attorney whose sole ambition will be to sue the District Attorney's office for wrongful arrest and reckless endangerment.
your father will be released on his own recognizance within the hour.
and reinstated. Tomorrow.
a word of advice...
be mindful of the battles you choose, because it will not always be this easy.
nice work, counselor.
thank you.
how's your arm?
Mmm, fine. Only hurts when I wave.
Ouch.
I'm fine, I promise.
I know you will be.
Thanks.
thank you for agreeing to talk to me.
you're talking. I only agreed to listen.
I just want to start with...
I know you think that...
Ahem. Hold on.
I can't talk right now, Felicity.
I know. But the grid at Collins and Main just spiked, drawing a hell of a lot of power.
which means someone either plugged in the world's largest hair dryer, or the biotransfuser just went online.
the power cycle on this machine is very specific.
you have 30 minutes, 40 tops.
I know this is selfish, Oliver, and don't hate me for saying this, but... don't go.
if you don't get Thea to sign those documents, your family loses all of its assets.
if I don't stop Slade right now, a lot of people will lose a lot more.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
removing him mid-cycle will surely end his life.
Slade, he's just a kid! - Who's here only because you pushed him away.
you were the one person he looked up to.
and for that, you crushed his soul.
we found him at a shelter in Bludhaven.
pathetic. Didn't even put up a fight.
I will.
tell me how to shut it down.
if you could feel the power that is surging through me...
you would know that I do not fear an arrow.
I am stronger than you can even imagine.
and soon...
I will not be alone.
you can't hurt me, kid.
come on, Roy. All right, stay with me.
he's lost a lot of blood.
I don't know what the biotransfuser did to him.
but his pulse is really weak; He's barely breathing.
and he needs a real doctor.
we can't take him to a hospital... they run tests.
we need to keep what's in him from getting out.
what do we do now?
the only thing we can do... we wait.
well, while we're waiting, we still have a Slade problem.
he's got 20 guys just like him, and we have no way to stop him.
Yes, we do.
is that what I think it is?
Mirakuru.
you weren't thinking about taking it, were you?
no.
we're going to use it to make a cure.
Oliver, we don't even know if it's possible to reverse the affects.
Yes, we do.
ivo did it.
why didn't you ever tell us that, Oliver?
because I'm ashamed.
of what?
five years ago, I had the chance to use the cure on Slade.
I chose to kill him.
everything that's happening right now is my fault.
I saved you once, Sara.
it feels like a long time ago now.
time to return the favor.
you might not believe it now, but I was considered a good man.
a good doctor. A good husband.
until the Mirakuru drove me mad.
I didn't even take any myself...
you didn't have to do that for me.
once you take a life...it changes you forever.
and I don't want that for you.
thank you.
so, now what do we do?
well, I don't suppose any of you know how to pilot a submarine?
Thea.
what are you doing?
just grabbing some stuff. Something tells me the mansion's new owner won't want my clothes here.
Thea, wait.
now he's not busy.
I'm so sorry, that couldn't be helped.
may I speak to you now?
dad knew the truth.
what?
he knew about Merlyn.
how?
he never said anything to me.
he didn't have to.
Thea, whatever Dad's faults were...
he loved us.
all of us.
because we were his family.
you were his daughter, and some stupid blood test wasn't going to change that.
he chose us.
he chose you.
he made a decision to be your father, even though he didn't have to be.
so what does that tell you?
it tells me that he's a liar.
just like both of you.
I need you guys to do me a favor.
this time, it'll be our secret.
Oliver.
what's this for?
because you're important to me.
but there are some things that must never be spoken of.
how could you not tell me Malcolm Merlyn was my father?!
Sara, you're not a killer!
I am what I need to be.
Roy, you're dangerous.
some people are just broken, man.
I am not letting what happened to Slade happen to Roy.
is that what I think it is?
Mirakuru. We're going to use it to make a cure.
no change?
Nope.
so much blood mixed in with so much Mirakuru,
I don't know if it's good or bad.
we could really use that cure.
I talked to Caitlin this morning.
they're working on it.
no mention on Isabel Rochev's death?
not a thing.
I wasn't expecting a glowing obituary, but she's a Fortune 500 CEO that's been missing for a week now.
you'd think she'd have some column inches.
does the fact that him lying there freaks me out a little make me a bad person?
Felicity, I don't think there's a force on earth that can make you a bad person.
but I am starving. Dinner?
Yeah.
no Big Belly burger, though.
it's giving me a Big Belly.
sushi, then.
sushi, then.
how can you be unconscious and freak me out at the same...
time?
Oh, my God!
Oh, you scared me.
forgot my phone.
you ok?
go!
what's going on?
you think Roy's ok?
please tell me that you're not thinking about Roy right now.
we're finally alone, in bed, in a very nice hotel room.
a hotel room that you couldn't afford.
I have something of a history with the manager.
Mmm. I can only imagine.
I think I trashed this specific room once.
but favors run out.
we should think about getting a more permanent place.
we?
well, you're probably getting tired of staying with Laurel, and we can't sleep in the foundry now that Roy's there, so...
but, I mean,"we," now you're asking me to move in with you?
Hey, your phone's ringing.
I know.
okay, both our phones are ringing, that's never good.
what happened?
I don't know. One minute he's comatose, the next, he's flipping over computer equipment.
he was a lot more out of control than Slade was at your house.
he looked like Roy, but he...wasn't Roy.
where do you think he's headed?
I don't know, but we have to find him.
despite everyone's predictions, you've managed to pull ahead of Sebastian Blood in recent polls.
Yes. I think our message is resonating with the voters.
the people of Starling know that I have a vision, and the experienced apparatus to make that vision a reality.
what would you say is the main reason they should vote for you over alderman Blood?
alderman Blood isn't a parent.
and the soul of being a parent is making sure that your children have a bright future.
and I've been very lucky to be able to do that for my own.
Yeah. Mother of the year.
uh, we're in the middle of an interview.
Oh, I'll keep it short.
you can't have your rally at verdant.
it's the only place I have that hasn't been poisoned by you.
can you give me one moment, please?
turn it off.
Thea, I know you're upset, and you have every right to be, but we need to talk somewhere else.
I'm done talking.
I just came by to tell you, it'll be a cold day in hell before you can use my club.
we can't just change the venue the day before.
I'm sure you can figure something else.
I mean, you have such an experienced apparatus.
you signed a contract.
huh. Just when I thought you couldn't go any lower...
you threaten your own daughter.
what's going on?
sorry you had to witness that.
after her abduction, I'd think that the two of you would be closer than ever.
it's a very complicated situation.
well, my advice?
simplify it.
you have to be either a mother or a candidate.
you can't be both.
not right now.
you cannot split your focus.
you're absolutely right.
you're really cute when you're mopey.
I'm not mopey.
Mopey's your default, Ollie.
it's part of your smoldering charm.
I do have smoldering charm.
but you're more than usual mopey.
is everything all right?
it's fine.
Tommy had me out a little bit later than maybe I should have been, and...
I'm wiped.
well, you want me to go?
I promised Sara I'd help her with her trigonometry.
I don't know what that is.
you are very cute.
get some sleep.
Bye.
Bye.
good night, Mrs. Queen.
good night.
you didn't go out with Tommy last night.
Hey.
thanks for eavesdropping on my entire conversation, Mom.
that's...that's nice.
sweetheart, something's bothering you, tell me what it is.
dad's going to kill me.
your father loves you.
I love you.
I screwed up.
it's bad.
what happened?
I got a girl pregnant.
Laurel's pregnant?
no.
not Laurel.
this is ridiculous.
we can't just ride around all night hoping to lay eyes on him.
his place is clean.
I don't think he's been back here.
call just went out for an ambulance at 14th and Hobart.
there's four men seriously assaulted by someone wearing a red hoodie.
what happened?
guy jumped us. Came out of nowhere.
the dude is 'roided out or something.
crazy like.
see ya, Sin.
Adios.
yo, Abercrombie.
hold up.
where you been, man?
I went over to your place like 20 times.
Thea said you skipped town.
holy crap.
have you been in a fight?
Hey, Sin, is this guy bothering you?
no, no, no, he's chill.
seriously, just step off.
we going to have a problem, guy?
Seriously?
just leave him alone, he's fine.
Oh, what, you got nothing smart to say?
Felicity's running facial recognition on traffic cameras throughout the city.
which could take forever.
we need to take Roy down now before he attacks any more people.
what part of "I want nothing to do with you" are just not understanding?
I came by to see Sara.
and what about him?
he's been stalking me.
he's protecting you.
from what?
Slade Wilson is still at large.
he already tried hurting you once.
he didn't hurt me.
he told me the truth, which I know you think is a bad thing, but it's actually not.
it is if it costs me you.
your lies did that.
now, I'm going to go upstairs to the stock room, and if I get attacked by some shot glasses, I'll call 911.
thanks for taking care of her.
lucky for me, she's not as good at disappearing as you were.
I'll be right back.
have you seen Thea?
what happened to your eye?
it's ok.
I could cover it with make-up.
if I work make-up.
it's fine.
who did this to you?
it's a long story.
I asked you who.
but he's not right in the head.
he got injected with something.
a drug, I don't know, but it made him strong.
like, comic book strong.
look, I know it sounds nuts...
it really doesn't.
Sara, Roy's a friend.
he needs help, not a beat down.
I'll have to call you right back.
do you want me to stay, Mr. Blood?
uh, no, no, thank you.
I'll be fine.
my new body man. He's a little over-protective.
hmm.
please. - No, thank you.
I'd say this visit is unexpected, but I despise understatements.
I'm dropping out of the race.
I'm making a concession speech at my rally tonight.
you're ahead in the latest polls.
even the most skeptical pundits are saying you could actually pull this out.
I felt I owed you the courtesy of informing you in person.
I don't, however, owe you an explanation as well.
no, you don't.
but I'd appreciate one.
what you're doing, Moira, as much as it benefits me, doesn't really make much sense.
it's my daughter.
at the moment, she needs me more than Starling does.
well, you're doing the right thing.
I'm going to change this city, Moira.
a new day is coming.
a better day.
for all of us.
I know things seem bleak, sweetheart, but we're going to figure this out, I promise.
mom, does it seem fair?
to make...
one mistake, and it...
feels like my entire life is over.
Oh, your life is far from over.
are you sure it's yours?
where there is money, Oliver, there are people looking to take advantage.
she's not that type of person.
she's a good person, Mom.
she's...
all right.
I don't know what to do.
what do I do?
we all make mistakes, Oliver.
and I had hoped that one day you'd forgive me for any that I might make, so...
all right, um, I'll be right back.
verdant, 14th and Hobart, and the bar Sin spotted him at.
he looks to be moving east.
what's east?
queen mansion.
if he still remembers where Thea lives...
well, used to live, but Roy doesn't know that...
there might be something in Roy still left in there.
or it's just a coincidence that he's moving east.
I know that Sin's involved, but don't let that cloud your judgment.
well, don't let the fact that this used to be Roy cloud yours.
I found Roy.
well, I thought I told you to go home.
Yeah, that's where I am right now.
and so is he.
he's not here.
it's Oliver.
it's me.
what you're doing right now, it's because of the Mirakuru.
you're a good person, Roy.
you have a conscience and a soul.
I need you to use those and fight this.
you can do it!
drop the arrow, drop it!
No!
a full moon tonight.
that really brings out the whack jobs.
good news is, it can't get any stranger.
my friend needs your help.
I was wrong. Got to call you back.
some of this damage is chronic.
the cost of jumping off rooftops, I guess.
I need to get back on my feet.
I can give you a brace, but you'll still be in horrendous amounts of pain.
six months ago, this cabinet would have been empty.
the Chinese Triad was stopping all of our med shipments...
until someone stopped them.
ever since, I've been looking for a way to thank you.
if you're going to have to follow me everywhere, at least don't lurk, all right?
I can't let you out of my sight.
you're sick of seeing me everywhere you go; lurking seemed like a good compromise.
Yeah, well, it's not.
family's hard.
sometimes they're the hardest in the world.
loving someone so much and letting them love you back.
you know, you're right...
you should go back to lurking.
I've spent a lot of time with your family.
if you think that gives you the right to weigh in, you're wrong.
Plus, Oliver will be out of money soon and you'll be unemployed.
right.
I guess I should get this in under the wire.
you know, your mother isn't perfect.
her judgment definitely isn't.
but there's one thing she's consistent about is that she loves you and Oliver.
and that should buy her what in your mind?
well, I don't know, Thea...
but she is your mother.
that should buy her something.
a second chance, maybe.
...a citywide man hunt for the perpetrator of an attack that left one police officer seriously injured and the other dead.
we have video shot by a bystander, but please be warned that the footage may be too graphic for some viewers.
Oh, my God.
I have to go see a friend.
if you have to follow, follow.
these aren't going to fix your knee.
they'll help it heal faster.
and until then?
where are we with facial recognition?
traffic cams can't get a clear shot.
now I see why you wear that hood.
we need to find Roy before the police do.
because they'll kill him and we won't?
S.T.A.R.Labs is working on a cure.
which they may never come up with.
and even if they do,
I mean, how many people are we going to let Roy kill in the meantime?
you know, you wanted to kill Helena, too.
you found another way.
that was different, and you know it.
Roy has the Mirakuru in him, just like Slade.
and if you had a clear shot of Slade right now, you would take it.
Roy isn't Slade!
Roy isn't Roy.
he's not himself anymore, he's too far gone.
I don't believe that.
do you even hear yourself right now, Ollie?
this is the exact conversation that we had five years ago, except we were freezing on Lian Yu.
what are you doing?
what needs to be done.
the Mirakuru won't do anything against a head shot.
your mother's rally starts in a half an hour.
I'd start getting dressed if I were you.
she reminds me so much of me after I came home.
when it just seemed...
seemed impossible to believe in anything even resembling hope.
but you did.
you did.
eventually.
Sara will, too.
Oh, thanks for coming.
it's chill.
who's that?
I...My shadow.
listen, something is going on with Roy.
I know, I saw him.
he's totally crazed.
what's happening to him?
do you remember around Christmas when he bailed on us?
yeah?
he got shot up with something, this drug, and it's been messing with his head.
did you tell my brother any of this?
No...Why?
he's got this bodyguard all over me.
he must know about Roy, think he's coming after me or something.
well, what are you going to do?
Roy, it's me.
it's Thea.
I'm so glad I found you.
I've been looking everywhere.
this is all my fault.
I did this to you.
when you broke up with me, it was a cry for help, and I didn't listen.
I should be punished.
I deserve to be punished.
someone hurts you, and you hurt them worse.
you hurt them permanently.
you should just kill me.
kill me.
kill me.
Oliver, where have you been?
haven't you got any of my calls?
I've been busy. What's wrong?
it's your mother.
she'll do fine.
no, she won't.
she's not using this event to rally the troops.
she's using it...
to tell people she's dropping out of the race.
what happened?
it's a motorcycle accident, it was stupid.
Yes, this would be the second accident in as many weeks, if my math is correct.
mark says you're dropping out of the race.
the truth is, I should have done it weeks ago, after Thea was abducted.
my complete focus needs to be on repairing our relationship.
mom, what's happening with Thea right now isn't because you weren't spending enough time with her.
well, maybe not.
I have to do something and I'm not sure what else to do.
Thea hates you right now because of the things that you've done.
terrible things.
so let her see you do something good.
as mayor.
mom, I know a little something about...
sacrificing the people closest to me for the good of this city.
it's what you need to do now.
I know.
good.
Oliver, I know.
I know.
I've known...since last year, I suppose.
the night of the Undertaking, everything became so clear.
it was pretty much the night I stopped sleeping.
before you say anything else... - There's nothing else to say.
nothing I need to say.
except I could not be more proud.
can I have Raisa get you anything to drink?
or...or something to eat, perhaps? Please.
Where's Oliver?
Ah, he's running an errand for me.
I thought it would give us a chance to talk.
with all due respect, um, Mrs. Queen, what's happening, it's between me and your son.
Yes.
what is that?
Oh, I had one of our investigators write up a dossier on you.
I'm sorry, but it's a necessary precaution against a fraudulent claim of paternity.
well, the baby is Oliver's.
Oh, of that I have no doubt.
our investigators were quite thorough.
but you can imagine how many people my family attracts who are looking for handouts.
well, I'm not looking for money.
of course not.
I told you, I don't want money.
and I'm telling you that this is my first grandchild.
and I want to make certain that he or she has a bright future.
please.
this is a million dollars.
I want to make certain that my son has a bright future as well.
that money is yours once you tell Oliver that you've lost the baby.
What?!
and another million when you return to Central City, never to speak to him again.
can I offer you some advice, one mother to another?
when it comes to your children, there is no action that is inconceivable;
there is no decision that is impossible.
you do what you must to provide the life that they need.
and I think that $2 million is sufficient to provide the life that both our children need.
don't you?
when I was first approached about entering this race, the prospect of winning seemed a distant, nearly impossible feat.
now, how could a city that had suffered so much place its faith in someone so responsible for its suffering?
but as the weeks progressed, good people such as you raised your voices in support, and I began to think that I could make a difference.
I could help save this city.
but...
recent events have changed things, and...
and now I know I can make a difference.
and should the honor become mine,
I promise with every breath I take to do what is necessary;
to sacrifice what is necessary for the good of this city.
Starling City is my home, you are my family, and there is nothing more important to me than family.
thank you, thank you all.
Ahh! Great speech, Moira.
a little too off-book for my liking, but we'll work on that.
I thought it was perfect.
Um...Hi.
I just wanted to come up here and say a few words.
I am so proud to have my mom here tonight at my club, Verdant, in the Glades.
what is she doing?
she knows this is being televised.
she's sending a message to Roy, trying to draw him out.
so vote Queen.
tell your friends.
Thanks.
Thea. That was not for you.
Oh, God, you're heavy.
is this really all muscle?
Ahem. How many of those venom arrows do we have?
about 20.
I need all of them.
okay.
are you sure that's a good idea?
can you even get into those leather pants with that knee?
lidocaine.
now.
let's see, the bottle says the proper dose is...
is all of it.
I don't think that's a good...ooh.
terrific speech, Moira.
how did we not think of running you years ago?
thank you.
uh, can you give me a moment?
Mm-hmm, of course.
Oh, hello.
you need to go now!
no, no, no! I can't leave without my daughter!
I'll see to the safety of your daughter!
go, go! Thea, we have to go now!
no, it's Roy! I'm not leaving him! He came here for me!
Roy, listen to me!
listen to my voice!
I don't know what's going on with you, but I have to believe the man I fell in love with is still inside there, somewhere.
you have to fight. You're strong.
you can fight this.
fight this!
put her down.
please don't.
he can't control it!
that's why I don't have a choice.
get out of the way.
don't do this.
kill me.
please.
kill me.
please don't do it!
no one dies tonight.
but the police...
go outside.
we'll get Roy the help he needs.
I promise! Go!
Ah, Tibetan pit viper venom.
a constant dose of that can't be good for you. Right?
it'll keep him sedated like it did Slade.
until when?
and what happens when we run out?
it's not like you can buy this stuff over the counter.
unless you're in Tibet.
Then...maybe.
we'll take care of him.
I'm not ready to give up on Roy.
anyone else crave dim sum after fisticuffs?
no? Ok. Dumplings for one, then.
I would have killed him.
I was ready to.
he'd be dead right now if you wouldn't have stopped me.
but he's not.
that's all that matters.
that's not true.
I wanted to kill Roy.
because that's what I do.
that's who I am.
I spent six years in the darkness.
and I looked into the eyes of the devil and I gave him my soul.
let me help you get it back.
no, you deserve someone better.
someone who can harness that light that's still inside of you.
but I'm not that person.
and I never will be.
don't.
I'm sorry.
I just care about you too much to be with you.
everything ok?
Yeah. Just had a long day. How's Roy?
well, he's alive, no thanks to me.
you know, that was brave getting between us.
it took guts.
not really.
I knew you wouldn't really hurt him.
you're not a killer.
what's this for?
say good-bye.
what? Wait, where are you going?
to see an old friend.
we've got every cop in this city canvassing.
we'll find this guy.
thank you.
you ok?
fine.
where were you?
he was with me.
glad to see the two of you are getting along again.
you knew about Roy.
what?
that's why you had your bodyguard stalking me.
somehow, you knew what was going on with him.
I'm just trying to protect you.
by not telling me the truth.
just like with Malcolm Merlyn.
you know, the two of you, you think you're protecting me by lying and by keeping secrets.
but that's what's actually hurting me.
you're absolutely right.
we need to turn a new page.
it's not going to be that simple.
or easy.
I know.
if the truth were easy for me, we wouldn't be in this situation.
but to start...
there's something about Malcolm that both you and Oliver need to know.
I was dead the last time you were offered this choice.
what's happening?
I often wonder how you looked...
when he pointed the gun at Shado...
and took her from me.
you psychopath.
Shado wasn't yours!
no, she was yours.
until you chose another woman over her.
that's not what happened!
it is what happened!
it is!
she told me!
what do you mean, she?
there's nobody there!
you were on the island with Oliver?
I thought I had known true despair, until I met your son.
I trusted him...
to make the right choice.
let me make the right choice now.
kill me.
No! - No!
choose me, please!
I am killing you, Oliver.
only more slowly than you would like.
don't.
choose.
don't... - choose.
please...
choose!
I swear to God, I am going to kill you!
No! No!
no.
mom...
mom, what are you doing?
there's only one way this night can end.
No!
and we both know that.
don't we, Mr. Wilson?
mom!
please, don't!
both my children will live.
mom! What are you doing?!
Thea, I love you.
close your eyes, baby!
No!
you possess true courage.
I am truly sorry...
what?
you did not pass that on to your son.
No!
No!
there is still one person who has to die before this can end.
mom?
mom!
No! No! Mom!
well, yeah, I'm sorry, too.
well, listen, if there's ever anything that I can do...
Hello?
who was that?
that was, um...
she lost the baby.
she said she's sad about it, and she's going to go back to school in Central City.
apparently she has family there.
well, I'm sure this has been very traumatic for her.
but it sounds for the best.
sure.
you ok?
Yeah. Yes.
I continue to be the luckiest guy on the planet. What...
what would I have done if she...
I'm not ready to be a dad.
no. But someday.
it's my fondest hope for you.
I'm glad I told you.
I don't think that I could have gotten through something like this without you.
you're never without me.
my beautiful boy.
tibetan pit viper venom.
a constant dose of that can't be good for you, right?
it'll keep him sedated like it did Slade.
no mention on Isabel Rochev's death?
not a thing.
choose.
choose!
No! No! No, mom!
mom, what are you doing?
both my children will live.
what are you doing?!
you possess true courage.
No!
there is still one person who has to die before this can end.
no...
mom?!
I do solemnly swear that I will support, defend, and abide by the Starling City charter.
that I will tirelessly pursue justice on behalf of all of starling's citizens...
impartially, to the best of my abilities.
so help me God.
thank you.
Hi.
I'm here for you.
I know.
ms. Queen.
I wanted to offer my sincere condolences on your loss.
your mother was a good woman.
she would have made a wonderful mayor.
thank you.
I'd love to speak with Oliver.
well, if you see him, tell him he missed his own mother's funeral.
no one's seen Oliver for a few days.
we all deal with grief in different ways.
and the loss of a parent is...
well, it changes you.
when you realize that your ancestors now look to you;
if you see Oliver, please tell him that I came by.
of course.
Hey.
Thanks.
I don't even know why I'm crying.
I didn't even like Moira.
terrible thing to say about someone after they've just died.
in my defense, she was not nice.
she was diabolical.
not a word you often hear at someone's funeral.
you're not crying for her, Felicity, you're crying for Oliver.
where is he?
how could he not be here?
I don't know.
if Oliver's smart...
he ran back to his island to hide.
but maybe he'll attend your funerals.
I always loved this photograph.
I thought your mother looked particularly beautiful.
well, she didn't.
she thought she looked bug-eyed.
she never said.
how are you holding up?
I'm not.
your mother gave her life for you, Thea.
she showed you how much she loved you in ways very few parents ever could.
I know.
she died thinking I hated her.
but all we ever needed was the truth.
it was a lie that killed her.
I don't understand.
he was on that island with Oliver.
and despises him for some reason.
there was a psychopath in our lives and my brother never warned us about him.
Thea, your brother loves you more than life itself.
you should keep that photo.
this sub is over 60 years old.
it was carrying the Mirakuru during the war when it ran aground.
blood.
Slade's.
he was bleeding out, dying.
until we decided to give him the Mirakuru.
not one of your better ideas.
what about my idea for you to fix this sub?
you were in the Navy.
the Russian Navy.
they taught us how to sink Japanese sub, not pilot them.
Anatoly, please.
I know it's a long shot, but if we get this sub operational, we can blow Slade and the Mirakuru out of the water and get the hell off of this island.
I mean, unless you have a better idea, this is our only chance of getting home.
OK.
I try.
no one has seen Slade Wilson since the night of the attack.
I mean, he hasn't made any further threats on the Queen family, but we got to find this son of a...
excuse me.
Hey.
missed you at the reception.
Yeah. I had to get back here, see what was happening with the case.
any leads?
no. Wilson's a ghost.
he's not the only one who's disappeared.
you heard from your sister?
nothing apart from a text that she needed a change of scenery.
something else on your mind?
it's Sebastian Blood.
there's something that doesn't seem right.
dad, I know what you're thinking.
when I accused him of killing his father, I was upset.
but just because I had a problem doesn't mean I was wrong about Sebastian.
please, don't go down this road again, ok?
what's bringing this on?
I saw him at the reception.
and it struck me that the only reason that he's mayor now is because Moira was killed.
Yeah, by Slade Wilson.
what if there's a connection?
you once told me, a cop is only as good as his gut.
well, I'm the daughter of a cop, and I know in my gut Sebastian is not the man that you think he is.
you sure?
baby, last time...
I was a drunk.
and you were right not to trust me.
but, Dad...
I need you to trust me now.
this legislation is the first step toward making Starling City the jewel that it once was.
the jewel that it can be again.
phone call for you, mayor Blood.
I'm still getting used to people calling me that, Alyssa.
please take a message.
the caller insisted.
he said he's your father.
that's impossible.
never mind.
I'll take it.
Hello?
Hello, Sebastian.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just wanted to check in and see how your first day is going.
very well, thank you.
but I'm a little busy right now, so if you'll allow me to call you back, I'll do that as soon as I can.
I'm sure you have quite a lot of business to attend to.
you are the major now, after all.
so get to work.
we're almost out of snake venom.
seeing Roy like this reminds me of Barry.
and Barry reminds me of S. T.A. R.Labs.
s. T.A. R.Labs reminds me of the Mirakuru cure that they're working on,
Yeah, especially since Isabel Rochev was clearly injected with the stuff.
how do you know?
cause there's no other way she could be walking around after being shot dead-on with a nine-millimeter hollow point.
I've left about a dozen messages for Oliver about Isabel being back.
no response.
you have any luck finding him?
tons.
all of it bad.
there's been no activity on his passport, cell phone, or bank accounts...
what's left of them, anyhow.
and facial recognition hasn't spotted him in any airport, bus, or train station.
right.
what about Sara?
nothing either.
dig, people don't just go missing like this, unless...
don't go there, Felicity.
what if she is?
what if Oliver is?
maybe the reason we can't find him is because...
he's alive, Felicity.
if he wasn't, Isabel Rochev wouldn't be so shy about rubbing it in our faces.
believe me, he's alive.
well, I hope you have some way on how to find him, because I am running out of places to look and people to ask.
I know who to ask.
thanks for agreeing to see us.
Mr. Diggle.
thought I made it clear after our last meeting.
as far as A. R.G. U.S. is concerned, you're out of favors.
I'm not asking for myself, Amanda.
I'm asking for everyone in Starling City.
I need you to find Oliver Queen.
that computer's running an XK-15 processor.
but that's not even supposed to exist yet.
I want one.
let me know what you find.
I don't have time to keep track of your friends, Mr. Diggle.
we deal with more pressing issues here.
you don't understand. Oliver's disappeared.
maybe he needs some time.
or is it possible that the two of you simply haven't been looking in the right place?
did you try facial recognition?
Yes, I ran it three times.
Amanda, please.
Slade Wilson has an army of men just like him.
how many men have been exposed to the Mirakuru?
enough to lay waste to this city.
we need to find Oliver right now.
I'll see what I can do.
have you heard from Sara?
no.
can you just call Mandy and see if she can cover the bar?
Isabel Rochev.
I know who you are.
what can I do for you, Ms. Rochev?
I'm sorry for your loss, Thea.
offer me your condolences?
my condolences, and to give you this.
it's a notice to vacate the premises.
this club and the steel factory in which its located are all assets of Queen Consolidated.
no, you...you can't do this.
it's already done.
how long do I have?
a couple days.
councilman Tyson is asking about dinner.
I already have plans tonight.
Hi.
excuse me, I didn't mean to barge in.
it's just that nobody was at your front desk, so...
Laurel, of course, please come in.
give us a moment.
twice in two days.
to what do I owe the pleasure?
I wish I could say that this was pleasure, but it's about a case.
I've barely moved in and people are already asking me for favors.
I guess I really have arrived.
you certainly have.
so tell me, how can I help you?
Murphy vs. Dunleavy.
the state's charged a real estate developer for turning away low-income tenants based on his so-called "morality.
have a seat.
let me guess.
our dear fair housing commissioner isn't willing to testify as your expert witness.
exactly.
and your predecessor wasn't willing to lean on him.
well, lucky for you, I'm not my predecessor.
you know, this actually reminds me of one I had during my days as a community organizer.
I was hoping that it would.
I've seen dozens of cases like this at CNRI.
well, it's a good thing we both remember where we came from.
I'm happy to help.
thank you.
I'm really glad you got your job back at the DA's office.
I look forward to us working together for a long time.
as do I.
is it working?
we're about to remote access the computer right now.
I'll tell you this, if you ever get tired of practicing law, you'd make a pretty decent spy.
you guys have a warrant for this, right?
just...
terrific.
could you at least tell me who's computer you bugged?
you're kidding.
I voted for him.
Yeah.
I need to know if there's anything incriminating in Blood's files.
what the hell, this is a dead end job, anyway.
this all looks pretty benign.
lots of policy papers, old documents transferred from his campaign office.
draft press releases...
wait, wait, wait, click back.
for immediate release...
my thoughts and prayers are with the Queen family in the aftermath of this unspeakable tragedy.
so he worked up a press release after Moira was killed.
no, he didn't.
he wrote that the day before Moira died.
she's right.
look at the timestamp.
Oh, my God.
Sebastian knew Slade was going to kill her.
is that the satellite frequency communicator TX50?
can I touch it?
I know that sounds a little weird and creepy, but I've never seen one in real life.
it's classified equipment, Ms. Smoak.
knowing everything about everyone, you must feel very powerful...
not powerful in an evil dictator Stalin way.
more of a...
knowledge is power, way.
ma'am. We have something.
I should have known.
what?
Oliver's at the lair from which he conducts his operations.
but we were just there.
not that lair.
his other one.
like riding bicycle.
underwater.
what's that sound?
we're stuck.
like Japanese were.
submarines have torpedoes, right?
can we blast our way out?
I can see why you two are made for each other. You like your explosions.
what?
these are Kaiten torpedoes.
manually operated.
someone needs to steer from inside.
okay, but then, how do they get away from the explosion?
they do not.
how did you find me?
we were worried about you.
after you missed your mother's funeral.
I'm sorry that I didn't go.
I left for the cemetery.
but I ended up here.
here is...
here was a secondary facility in case the foundry was compromised.
but it became somewhere that I could just go and be alone.
she's dead because of me.
five years ago...
I could have cured Slade.
and that would have prevented all of this.
and now, all the people left that I care about, we are all in his crosshairs.
it ends tonight.
how?
I turn myself over to Slade.
I end this vendetta.
Oliver, you think this ends with you turning yourself over to Slade?
Yes, I do.
after she was gone...
he told that one more person had to die.
and then it would end.
this ends for Slade when he kills me.
I don't accept that.
you shouldn't, either.
you can't just accept things, Oliver.
if I had accepted my life,
I would be a cocktail waitress in Vegas like my mother, and I never would have gone to college, and I never would have moved a thousand miles away to work at Queen Consolidated, and I never would have believed some crazy guy in a hood when he told me I could be more than just some IT girl.
please don't do this.
someone once told me that the essence of heroism is to die so others can live.
it's not that simple, Oliver.
Yes, it is.
Slade's whole plan was to take everything from me.
he did.
he wins.
all that's left is for me to die.
no, there has to be another way.
there isn't.
Thea, please.
I understand you're upset.
this is an emotional time for all of us.
I'm not being emotional.
I'm...
I'm an orphan!
I'm a jobless and homeless orphan.
there's nothing left for me here.
I'm here.
I thank you for that, but...
honestly, I need to start over.
we missed you at the funeral.
and the reception.
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there.
what's going on here?
Thea's thinking of leaving Starling City.
no, I am leaving.
Walter, could I speak to my sister for a moment?
I'm sure you'll have better luck.
Ollie, please.
just don't even try to convince me to stay.
I won't.
I think it's a good idea.
you should get as far from Starling City as you possibly can.
in our family, out of you, me, mom and dad, you are the best of us.
you have the purest heart.
and I can't ever have you lose that.
OK?
you promise me?
OK.
I know that I haven't always been the best brother, or friend, or whatever you've needed me to be.
but there has not been a day since you were born where I didn't cherish having you as a sister.
I'll, um, get in touch when I get settled somewhere.
it's Oliver.
this ends now.
I'll be at the pier, I'll be alone.
I'll do it.
Peter, you'll die.
I'm already dead.
radiation poisoning.
Ivo's little gift.
he said he needed to find out if Mirakuru could cure cancer.
guess we'll never find out.
Oh, I'm sorry, Peter, I didn't know.
ivo said the essence of heroism is to die so that others can live.
I held on to that.
it's the only thing that gave me hope.
so I'll go.
I mean, I may not be saving millions of lives, but I'll be saving yours.
this is where it all started.
got on the "Queen's Gambit" right over there.
I should have died on that boat.
if I had, none of this would have happened.
I never would have met you.
Shado and my mother would still be alive.
no one else is going to die because of me.
Diggle, what the hell?
he told me who you were.
did he hurt you?
no.
he was trying to hurt you.
and when you went missing, I reached out to your partners.
they told me what you were planning on doing.
it's what I have to do.
will you give us a moment?
you thought about telling me at the night of the undertaking.
I thought about telling you almost every night.
why didn't you?
Tommy knew.
didn't he?
you were with him.
you were with him at the end.
his last words were about you.
he wanted to know if you were safe.
sorry I couldn't save him.
and my mother.
but I can save you.
and Thea.
I can save the city if this ends tonight.
no. No! You can't commit suicide, Ollie.
you won't do that to me.
or to Sara, or to your friends.
or to Thea.
she just lost her mother.
losing you would destroy her.
but she'll be alive.
I don't know anything about hoods and masks or human weapons or any of this.
but I know you.
I know you like I know my own name.
and I realize it may sound crazy in light of your secret, but I know who you are in your bones, Oliver.
and that person... that person doesn't give up.
that person, he always finds a way.
not this time.
you're wrong.
you want to protect the people who you love?
then the only way to do that is to stop Slade Wilson.
Laurel, I can't!
Yes, you can!
by stopping Sebastian Blood, because Sebastian is working with Slade Wilson.
I have proof.
Slade Wilson killed your mother so that Sebastian could become mayor.
you were right about him.
the man in the skull mask works for Slade Wilson.
and this entire time, it was Sebastian.
what's happening is bigger than you and Slade.
this city needs the Arrow.
what's this for?
I don't want you to be in here.
no, I'm going to stay with you...
Sara. If this doesn't work, I need you to be safe.
we will come for you when it's over.
OK.
do you know how the torpedo works?
I get in, he fires, I steer, you pray.
Peter, what you're doing is...
practical.
my time's already up.
brave.
you need to know that.
and I don't think that I could do something like this.
you have. What you did for us...
coming back to that boat, setting us free?
I came back to the boat because I want to go home.
I wasn't thinking about saving anybody.
it's...it's not who I am.
maybe not yet.
go?
is Sara clear?
Yes.
Yes.
hello.
good to see you.
you can wait in the car.
are you sure that's a good idea?
nothing's going to happen to me here.
how are you doing, Mr. Mayor?
Hi.
good to see you, good to see you.
thank you.
good to see you Sir.
congratulations, Mayor Blood.
nice to see you.
Sebastian, may I join you for dinner?
Hey, can you hold that?
Oh, thanks a lot, man, appreciate it.
I have some questions for you.
go to hell.
you sure that's how you want to play it?
you think I've never took a beating before?
pal, you're going to wish I beat you.
Hi.
I'll be your interrogator.
is this a joke?
social Security number 306003894.
what the hell's this supposed to be?
Oh, look at this.
you have a bank account in the Cayman Islands.
Wow.
$2 million, quite the little nest egg.
but...
looks like you just approved a wire transfer of $1 million to a charity here in Starling City.
very generous.
what should I do with the rest?
Greenpeace.
great cause!
and they really appreciate the support.
you bitch!
bitch with WiFi.
Hey, Clinton, looks like your mom and dad have a really nice retirement portfolio, too, but they, oh, no, are just about to make some really bad investments.
OK, wait, just wait...just...stop!
what do you want to know?
I missed you at your mother's memorial service.
I wanted to offer my condolences.
you're the mayor.
Congratulations.
you've always wanted that.
believe me, Oliver, I wish it had happened a different way.
your mother and I, we...we didn't agree on much.
but we both wanted what was best for Starling City.
I will help this city find its heart again, I promise you that.
do you really think that he will let that happen?
how do you know I've been working with Slade Wilson?
because I'm the Arrow.
of course.
it all makes sense now.
it was right in front of me.
you came to my office and you shook my hand.
you said that together, we can save this city.
you think that there will be a city to be saved after you unleash Slade's Mirakuru army?
they'll only cause enough damage to make the city ready.
ready for your leadership?
for my vision of what this city could be.
a better city.
and after the storm they're about to suffer, the people of Starling will support and follow me to that city.
whatever Slade promised you, he will not deliver.
he wants to hurt me.
you are a pawn in a much larger game.
Slade promised me city hall.
and he delivered.
he makes good on his promises.
I understand he made you a promise, too.
what are you going to do?
you going to stab the mayor in a restaurant full of people?
it's a new day in Starling City, Oliver.
and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
Slade's men are taking the city tonight.
they can try.
there's more men than we thought, all on Mirakuru.
it could be a massacre.
not if we get to them first.
we stick to the plan, no matter what.
Slade's using the sewer system.
you can drop in at Rock Avenue and then head southeast.
the lines converge at Water Street.
if Slade's army's underground, that's probably where he'll be.
good.
let's go.
Diggle, you ready?
never not.
I'm coming, too.
no, you're not.
felicity can give me a radio.
I'll just be your eyes and your ears.
I'll stay out of your way, I promise.
nothing will happen to me.
what if it did?
Slade's men, one on one, they are nearly impossible to stop.
I need you to trust me.
and I need you to be safe.
but not them?
this started with the three of us.
it's time we got back to that.
tonight we rise up as one and take back this city.
I have eyes on Blood's army.
got it.
I'm forwarding Dig your ping along with the foundation schematics of the Topside Avenue.
follow the route I laid out on the blueprints.
you'll see structural joints in the concrete.
blow them all and Blood gets buried.
got it.
um, excuse me, why can't I board my train?
I'm sorry, ma'am, it's just business class right now.
coach will be boarding soon.
OK.
come on, pal.
isn't that one of the Iron Heights escapees?
dumbass here tried to rob a convenience store but gave up as soon as I pulled in.
mind if I just stick him here for a minute?
no, go ahead.
I'm just asking here.
Oliver, you've worked really hard not to kill anymore.
dropping an entire block on these guys is murder.
manslaughter, at least.
they're not men not anymore..
have Diggle blow the charges the moment he's ready.
we will lead this city out of the darkness, and each one of you will help me.
come on.
Oliver, where the hell are you?!
you killed me...
let me return the favor.
Hey.
you got the time?
it's, uh, 9:00.
Thanks.
Oliver, please.
cisco, now is really not a good time.
there.
there's too many of them!
we can't fight.
we're not going to.
turn the wheel!
what direction?
it does not matter. Just turn the wheel.
I can't!
that is not an option.
I got it!
we're moving!
good, good.
Sara, we did it.
my name is Oliver Queen.
after five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal...
to save my city.
now others have joined my crusade.
to them, I am Oliver Queen.
but to the rest of Starling City, I am someone else.
I am something else.
my name is Amanda Waller, Mr. Queen.
welcome to Hong Kong.
Amanda Waller wants you working for her.
she will have her way.
you're Felicity Smoak.
I know a guy who might be interested in hiring someone with your expertise.
apparently there's another bidder for the company.
who?
what are you doing here?
No! No!
No! No! Please!
Felicity, all I'm trying to do is make things easier on you.
by having me completely reconfigure our phone system?
do you even know how difficult it is to ping a clone off a hacked transband multiplex?
no, but only because you weren't speaking English just now.
I didn't know where else to take her.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh. What happened?
I couldn't... I couldn't leave her.
we have to... call...we can... take her to the hospital!
Ollie. Ollie, it's not fair!
we just got her back, it's not fair!
come here...
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
we'll take our position here.
who's your target?
I don't have a target... you do.
what?
might have escaped your notice, but Amanda Waller doesn't have a sense of humor.
Oh, really?
then why'd she drag me off of Lian Yu and bring me all the way to Hong Kong to become her hit man?
to become her operative.
obviously she needs you for something or she wouldn't be threatening my family to assure your compliance.
the target will be entering our line any moment.
the target will walk 10 paces through the roof garden and arrive at his hotel suite.
that's your window.
I see it.
now.
you know, Sara used to have a stuffed animal.
it was this old, worn out shark that she got from the Starling Aquarium.
every time something awful would happen to her,
I would always find her holding that stupid little shark close to her chest.
and now that my sister's dead,
I'm sorry.
you have nothing to apologize for.
Hey, whoever did this, I'm going to find them.
we're going to.
when I thought that Sara died on "The Gambit,"
the only thing that I could do was scream at the ocean.
I had so much anger and rage, and I didn't know what to do with it.
but I do now.
and I'm going to help you catch whoever it is that did this.
you're already helping.
Laurel... You told us where to look.
I'm just supposed to sit here and wait?
no.
now you take care of yourself and your family.
your father is going to need you.
telling him now, it would kill him.
at least now if we wait until we catch whoever did this, it'll be easier on him.
OK.
where are you going?
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
but I know that a bar is the last place I should be.
come on, pick up.
you've reached Thea.
leave a message.
Thea, it's Oliver.
um... I know you're still traveling, but I just, I could really...
I'd really like to hear your voice.
so please call me back.
What'd we get off the cameras?
place is a drug haven.
they've all either been disabled or paint-balled by local dealers.
where are you going?
where it happened.
felicity told me.
you ok?
killer stood there, loose gravel on the rooftop.
Oliver... - Sara was here.
scuff marks back to the edge.
you don't have to do this right now, man.
it's the only thing that I can do.
listen, I get it.
military training.
stay on task.
your friend gets shot, you just keep fighting. But Oliver...
I'm fine.
well, I'm here for you just the same.
listen, Sara was my friend, too.
and if you think you're going after the person who did this solo, you couldn't possibly be more wrong.
yeah?
detective Lance called, he says it's important.
do you think he knows about Sara?
what is it, Detective?
you ok?
you look like someone peed in your cornflakes.
that kind of day, huh?
what's going on?
another archer in town.
dropping bodies.
seen this guy's work before?
I might have.
you know where SCPD is finest might find him?
who's the victim?
some corporate financier from Qurac.
he ended up with an arrow to the chest.
Hey.
you watch your back, all right?
whoever this guy is... - He's a killer.
her hands are so small.
I never noticed before.
she was always so strong and brave.
I always envisioned her as this sort of Amazonian warrior.
invincible.
something I could never be.
I was so jealous.
Hi.
I know I was supposed to come into work today.
I...the...I'm sorry.
there's been a death in the family.
thank you.
you have any idea what other archer could have done this?
there aren't that many of us.
maybe 10 that I know of, and most of them are in the League of Assassins.
Oliver, you don't think...
no.
no.
they don't target their own.
what had you find out?
he hit again.
an abandoned warehouse on the corner of Third and Lemire.
ninth floor.
the victim was a construction foreman, Tim Kaufman.
security cameras can't get an angle.
who's that?
just some low level dealers that set up shop in abandoned warehouses.
doesn't look like much of an archer to me.
he might be a witness.
where do you want me?
will Lyla give you access to A. R.G. U.S.'s database?
to find out who did this, Lyla will give us access to A. R.G. U.S.
I need a list of everyone on their radar assassins and mercenaries who use a bow.
I'm on it.
what?
uh, Thea hasn't called back yet.
you didn't eliminate the target!
that's not a target, that's my best friend!
why am I pointing a gun at my best friend?
is this some sort of test?
Yes. One you failed!
good. Flunk me.
you think it's a coincidence your friend just happened to show up in Hong Kong?
he's here looking for you!
what?
when you logged into your email, it set off an account alert.
dead men don't check their email, Oliver.
Oh, so this is my fault?
Waller needs you.
she can't let you be compromised by some rich kid flashing your picture all over Hong Kong.
whether you're the one who pulls the trigger or not, she wants Tommy Merlyn off the board.
that is a cobalt encrypted workstation.
you better not be using it to Tweet.
I was...I was, um, actually just...
accessing an FBI database?
what... Roy, why are you looking for Thea?
because I don't think she is where she says she is.
why would she lie?
Roy, Oliver needs to see this.
no. This is my fault.
he's going to kill me.
what if she's in trouble?
what if she's not? What if she just needs space?
she's had five months and thousands of miles of space.
Oliver needs to see this.
you need to show it to him.
you have got to be kidding me.
What...where are you going?
there's someone I need to kill.
did you do it to make a point?
because I get it.
loud and clear.
you are rich.
you are impulsive.
and believe me when I'm telling you that that is saying a lot, And...
what are you doing to our old offices?
Hi.
I'll be right back.
you like it?
Yeah, I'm just trying to liven up the place a bit.
I'm hosting an event tonight.
a pledge drive of sorts.
got to make an impression, right?
now, what can I do for you?
you can stop.
you can stop sending me flowers, and you can stop texting me and calling me and emailing me, because I spam them, anyway.
Oh, is "spam" a verb now?
because I am never, ever, ever going to work for you.
actually, you already do.
only because you bought the store that I work at!
no, I didn't.
Yes, you did!
my boss just called and told me that you did.
well, he's wrong...kind of.
I bought the holding company which owns and operates all 20, 000 Tech Village stores.
but I guess either way, yes, I am your boss now.
so you can either work for me here in a big office with a big salary, or...
you can work for me there, in that awful uniform.
or...I can quit.
which is what I just did.
you know, most girls would be flattered that I spent $1. 2 billion to hire them.
even if I do have a fairly genius plan for rebranding the stores.
in case you haven't noticed, I am not most girls.
and I don't need this.
or you.
or any of this.
Felicity, I...I piss people off on a daily basis.
it's part of business, and, well, being the smartest guy in any given room.
I own that.
so I have enough experience with people being angry with me to know when they're really angry at something else.
you right now are not angry at me.
what's your something else?
Oh, money won't fix this problem.
money won't solve most problems.
not the ones that matter.
but talking helps.
I know we barely know each other...
I'm going to leave now.
listen, whatever happened, sorry.
it helps to remember that... It gets better.
someone was murdered here.
tell me what you saw.
I saw nothing.
there was a black face mask, like a...like a hockey mask.
now, please, man...
Diggle, are you at A.R.G.U.S? I've got something.
Yeah, I'm here.
I got a list of archers 20-long, man.
how many of them wear masks?
only one.
mercenary.
goes by "Komodo."
send Felicity everything.
Yep.
Oliver, I'm opening up the file now.
is that him?
Simon Lacroix. Born in Saint-Sophie, Quebec.
raised by a single mom. Terrible credit score.
Oh, and wanted for murder in seven countries.
I need his location.
one minute.
put him on speaker.
OK, indexing all active burner cell phones within the city limits.
there's got to be 10, 000 phones.
Yes, but how many are making calls to dear old mom in Saint-Sophie, Quebec?
I got him.
he's on the move.
I found Lacroix.
I need to see what's happening.
OK.
blowing up street camera feed.
Ollie, what's happening.
come on, Ollie. Get up.
Oliver? Are you ok?
Oliver? Are you ok?
he got away.
I had him, Diggle.
the way you look, he almost had you.
Where's Roy?
he's out canvassing.
tell me about the driver of the car.
his name is Erlich Kelso.
he just got out of Starling General...
and where are we with Lacroix?
he ditched his burner.
I'm searching the city for any calls made to Quebec.
we used that to track him once; He's not going to let it happen again.
all right, so why don't we stop searching for Lacroix and start searching for his target?
because there must be a connection with his victims.
already on it.
I mean, what if we just...we go to a local morgue and we find a body that looks like Tommy's?
at the Hong Kong morgue?
you've got a better chance of winning the lottery and trying to pay Waller off.
I am not going to assassinate my best friend, do you understand?
there has to be another way.
there is.
but it involves Amanda Waller finding someone else to execute your friend.
no, not you, Dad.
look, I'm already in Hong Kong.
No! No, I didn't tell you I was taking the jet because I knew you would freak out like this.
no, I don't know how long, ok?
it doesn't matter.
listen, if Oliver is still alive, if he is still here...
look, why don't you just go back to banging your Pilates instructor, ok?
I'll just be here searching for my best friend.
I'm sorry, miss.
you can't go in there.
I'm with the district attorney's office.
erlich Kelso is a witness of my ongoing investigation.
Mr. Kelso's under protective custody.
not from me.
and if you have a problem with that, you can call your captain.
tell him his daughter says hello.
who are you?
I work in the DA's office.
I already told the police, I don't know anything.
I still have to ask you a few questions.
why isn't this working?
it is.
it's running an NSA algorithm aggregating the victims' personal information using every government database known, and unknown.
well, it's taking too long.
Sara's killer is still out there, which means that every minute that we waste down here...
I know!
you don't need to tell me as if I don't already know.
you're right.
and I apologize.
I just need your a game right now, Felicity.
I don't have it!
my friend...our friend... was shot with arrows and fell off of a rooftop.
her body is upstairs right above us in a freezer because we don't know what to do with it... with her.
so I am so sorry, Oliver, if I have feelings, but maybe if you did, too, we...
sorry.
that was mean.
but this is Sara we're talking about.
your Sara.
how can you stand there being so cold and rational?
cause I don't have the luxury of falling to pieces.
everyone's looking to me to handle things, to make the right decisions.
everyone is looking to me... to lead.
if I grieve, nobody else gets to.
you're still a human being, Oliver.
you're allowed to have feelings.
I know sometimes that it's easier to live under that hood.
I'm not.
earlier today, I was looking at Sara, I realized something.
one of these days it's going to be me.
and this... This life that I've chosen...
it only ends one way.
so that's it?
you're just going to spend your life hiding down here in this cave, waiting to die?
I'm sorry.
I'm not going to wait with you, because if there's one thing that today has taught me, is that life is precious.
and I want so much more in mine than this.
let's start with the obvious.
why would someone want to kill you?
I have no idea.
this whole thing, it's insane.
Mr. Kelso, despite what you may have heard, homicides at the hands of a stranger are incredibly rare.
imagine how rare homicides by bow and arrow are.
Yeah, the guy was a sicko.
and you're a liar.
I'm the victim here.
you're also a witness... my witness.
and you better give me something useful, otherwise you're going to be facing an obstruction charge.
you know, I think I want to talk to your boss, because you can't treat people like this.
Oh, really, you want to talk to my boss?
how's your arm feeling?!
what are you doing?!
John Burke and Tim Kaufman, they were also shot by with arrows.
and they're too dead to tell me why.
can't.
Burke and Kaufman!
what do the two of them have to do with you?
we were all working on a deal!
but nobody was supposed to know about it.
what kind of deal?
to build an oil pipe line for Amertek. It's...
you've reached Thea.
leave a message.
Hey, Thea, it's me.
again.
and...I don't know if you're getting these messages, but I would really like to talk to you.
so please, just call me back.
Bye.
Lyla has multiple teams trying to get an angle on Lacroix.
Where's Felicity?
hmm. She needed some air.
and what do you need, Oliver?
I just need Thea to call me back.
that's not going to happen.
Why?
what do you mean?
it was during the siege.
we were going to run away together, but I couldn't leave without helping you fight.
and when I came back, she was gone.
I didn't say anything because this is my fault.
she knew I was lying to her the entire time.
I'm sorry I didn't say anything about the letter.
I know that I should have.
OK.
Felicity, I really need to talk to you, so please, can you call me back as soon as you get this.
baby, are you all right?
are you hurt?
I'm fine.
baby, a guy just got skewered right in front of you.
I hope you're not fine.
and what the hell were you doing here in the first place?
the district attorney's office... - did not send you.
you lied to my officers and now what, you're just going to stand there and you're going to lie to me?
I needed to talk to him.
it was important.
look, sweetie, I know you want to help, but you don't need to take these kind of risks, you understand?
pretty sure your sister's got that covered for the both of you.
Yeah.
go home.
we got this.
OK?
I've got something.
meet me at Verdant.
Amertek industries.
it's an oil company based in Starling City.
OK.
now that I've consolidated all of Lacroix's victim's records,
I can run the algorithm, scan the data and see who received money from Amertek.
how long does that take?
not long.
three to Kelso, one more to Burke, two more to Kaufman.
all from a subsidiary from Amertek in Qurac, which just happens to be the largest untapped oil field on the planet.
Yeah.
looks like Amertek was trying to strike an oil deal.
and some paid Lacroix to stop it.
none of this explains how Sara was involved.
Sara once told me she worked in Qurac.
and by "worked," I mean she killed people for the League.
you're saying she might have brought her work home with her.
who authorized the payments?
a board member of Amertek called Tom Westin.
he's Lacroix's next target.
what's his location?
you will not believe where he's headed.
where do you think you're going?
I'm coming with you.
absolutely not.
Oliver, the only reason why you know where to find him is because...
you were reckless.
and Lacroix almost put an arrow in you.
let me handle this.
don't you dare tell me to stay put and think that I'll listen!
you know me better than that.
Sara was trained by some of the greatest killers in human history.
lacroix put her down.
so what do you think he's going to do to you?
I don't care about anything except for getting him.
and I will.
you couldn't before!
I won't let him escape again.
I promise.
ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ray Palmer.
thank you.
thank you all for coming out tonight.
given all that has be fallen this city, it's easy for us to lose hope...
to hide in our castles and be thankful that our ledges are in the black.
well, we, the city's most affluent businessmen and women hold its future in our hands.
tonight, I'm making a pledge.
I will give away half of my net worth to the benefit of our home.
and this will be my salary for the year.
so tonight, I invite you all to join me in this investment.
not just with your money, but with your ingenuity, and most importantly, your time.
the city is my home, but it's yours, too.
so help make Star City our future.
let go of the arrow.
I thought you'd be taller.
it's over.
lower your bow and live.
we both know that's not going to happen.
who hired you?!
who's she?
you don't want to do this.
Yes, I do!
killing him won't bring her back.
I know it won't bring her back, she's dead!
I have stood where you are right now;
where you're so consumed with rage you can hardly breathe, and you think that taking revenge will make it better, but Laurel...it won't.
it only makes it worse.
no, he murdered Sara!
who's Sara?
my sister, you son of a bitch!
two nights ago, you put an arrow in her chest.
two nights ago I was drunk in Bludhaven.
you're lying.
I'm proud of my work.
I wouldn't deny it.
even with a gun in your face?
Laurel, you need to stop and listen to him.
no.
no, he killed my sister.
Laurel, Sara wouldn't want...
don't you dare tell me that this isn't what Sara would have wanted!
don't you tell me to think of her, because I am thinking of her!
Laurel, if you pull that trigger...
you took the bullets out of the gun!
we have to go.
lacroix's alibi checks out.
two murders in Bludhaven, same MO.
same night Sara was killed.
I almost killed Lacroix.
the only thing that matters is you didn't.
Laurel... the trail's run cold.
I'm going to find whoever did this.
I will.
but I don't know when.
your father deserves to know.
Hey, listen. I got some word on the boy.
Yeah, some stuff's come through.
I don't know. Yeah. It looks pretty good.
lacroix, with an "x."
Yeah. I don't know, the guy's French or something, why you asking...
Oh, hold on, hold on.
I got to call you back.
Laurel, baby, what's wrong?
hold on.
what is it?
just tell me. Tell me, what is it?
it's about last night.
at the hospital.
I lied to you.
and you deserve to know the truth, and...
sorry, sweetheart.
damn thing goes off every hour if I don't take my pills.
Laurel, what do you know?
you looked like you were in the middle of telling me something.
I just wanted to say that...
that I'm really sorry.
I know that I should have told you the truth, I just...
I just got to...
Hey, I'm your dad.
I forgive you.
come here.
I always forgive you.
it's all right.
she can rest now.
she's home.
it's a Jewish custom.
I know she wasn't, but it feels right.
no, this isn't right.
this isn't... It...
she doesn't even get a fresh grave?
it's so perverse.
she deserves a proper burial.
she's earned it.
no, it's not fair.
no one will ever really know who she was.
Oliver, it's not fair.
it's not fair!
Laurel, we'll know.
I know this doesn't count for much, but me and Lyla, we're naming the baby Sara.
we will never forget.
thank you.
how did I... what the hell is going on here?
where am I?
please, please don't...please don't hurt me.
just...just let me go, please.
I promise, I...I won't tell anybody about this.
would a fisherman throw his prized catch back into the sea?
what are you talking about?
look, whoever you are, you really don't want to do this.
do you have any idea who I am?
who my father is?!
you're Thomas Merlyn.
you've been looking for Oliver Queen.
How...how do you... how do you know that?
a simple hack of a missing billionaire's email account.
I knew somebody would come looking for him, but I thought it would be his...Mother. His sister.
but you, the son of the CEO of Merlyn Global.
jackpot.
my friend, you are going to make me a very rich man.
so Oliver didn't...
he isn't...
Oliver Queen is dead.
he's rotting at the bottom of the ocean.
and you will, too, if your father doesn't pay that ransom.
I'm in here, please help!
help! Police! - Hong Kong police!
it's ok. Thank you!
you're going home.
you're safe now.
I'm going to catch whoever killed her.
I know you are.
and until you do, I'm back on the team.
what about your family?
Sara is family, Oliver.
just like you, man.
so now what?
now I got to go get Thea.
it's long past time she came home.
I don't want to die down here.
so don't, Oliver.
you changed your mind?
I just decided I want more out of life.
well done.
Thanks, Dad.
my name is Oliver Queen.
after five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal...
to save my city.
now others have joined my crusade.
to them, I am Oliver Queen.
but to the rest of Starling City, I am someone else.
I am something else.
Hello, Sara.
what are you doing here?
whoever did this, I'm going to find them.
apparently there's another bidder for the company.
who?
Yes, I am your boss now.
No!
Roy, I don't trust you, or anyone.
don't try to find me.
I am never coming back.
now I've got to go get Thea.
it's long past time she came home.
well done.
Thanks, Dad.
so, where are we going?
wherever you want.
it's up to me?
why not?
I'm a well-traveled man.
I've been every place in the world there is.
but you want to get out of here.
because if the police know you're alive, they come after you.
the Arrow, too.
you're very perceptive, Thea.
knowing when people are hiding something behind their smiles.
your mother had that talent.
Yes.
if someone knew where I was, it would be unfortunate...
for both of us.
so why did you reach out to me?
you reached first.
still.
I don't want to feel this pain again.
I don't want to hurt or get hurt ever again.
and you seem like someone who can teach me how not to.
I didn't do it!
a woman was killed on a rooftop last week.
black leather, blonde hair, wore a mask!
I didn't kill her. - You were there!
I don't know anything about it!
your fingerprints are on this.
from a fifth I drank up there, but I...
what did you see?
nothing!
I was up on the roof with some buddies.
this lady, she showed up and she...
she told us to go!
looked like she could handle herself, you know?
whoever it is you're looking for, I wouldn't want to be him.
another dead end.
it took me a week to get a hit off that print.
I had to reconstruct the partial using a predictive indexing algorithm.
appropriate, since it was his index finger...
not particularly relevant now.
don't worry, Oliver, we'll find him.
he's out there somewhere.
no, he's not.
trail's gone cold.
I hate to do this, but I have to head off to work.
tech Village is open this early?
not exactly.
have you figured out where in Italy Thea's staying?
Yeah, about that...she's not in Italy.
or Europe. Or, well, she's...
where is she?
I had to ping her cell phone to find out where in Italy she was texting from.
turns out, came back Corto Maltese.
Corto's an island off of South America.
what's up with your family and islands?
wait, Oliver.
Thea's letter said not to come find her.
that letter was addressed to you, not to me.
I'm watching Laurel go through losing Sara.
it's time for my sister to come home.
what are you doing?
Thea's gone because of me.
because the lies that I told her.
so I owe this to both of you to make things right.
no.
what are you...doing?
you can't travel with that.
I've actually never been on a plane before.
I know.
you're not doing anything and I could literally watch you forever.
Oh, yeah?
what about once she discovers boys?
well, that's what my Glock is for, right, baby?
right. It's my Glock.
I'm going to enjoy some quality time with her for the next few days.
I'm even looking forward to changing a few diapers.
and I'm looking forward to believing that when I see it.
why the time off?
you quit the team again?
no, Oliver's going to Corto Maltese for a couple of days.
could you go with him?
like I don't already spend enough time with Oliver as it is?
team Arrow may have Starling City purring like a kitten, but the rest of the world is still a very dangerous place.
including Corto Maltese.
Lyla, I already don't like where this is headed.
we have a field operative down there who's gone dark.
all right, so send an agent.
send a task force.
he's not in any kind of trouble.
he hasn't touched his panic button.
he's probably just drunk in some belleza's villa.
mark Shaw's been known to miss a few days from time to time.
will you just do me a favor...
and see if he's ok?
tell him to check in.
two more days and I'm going to have to call in the cavalry.
and I don't want to get him into trouble with Waller.
mark's an old friend.
she better not do anything interesting while I'm gone.
next time, keep your hands up.
well, I guess that badge means you're not here for a self defense class.
no, I've already had my fair share.
I'm here about one of your students, Tom Bronson.
a witness places him at the scene of a break-in last night.
well, that's not possible.
see, because Tom and I were sparring last night.
Mr. Grant, do you know that lying to the district attorney is against the law?
if by that, you mean am I willing to lie in order to keep a good kid who just happened to make a stupid mistake out of this system?
I think you know my answer.
are you admitting to perjury, Mr. Grant?
now that's a big word.
I'm just a dumb fighter.
right?
look, Tom was here with me last night.
we worked on his uppercut combinations.
like I said, in this city, there's a lot of good people who get dealt bad hands.
they lose someone, they lose themselves, which is why they come in here to work off that rage.
I've gotten good at picking out the types.
types just like you.
if I'm angry, it's because I'm dealing with someone who's willing to lie to a D. A.to protect a punk kid.
I don't think that's the case.
either way, if you do have something you want to work off...
so what's the play with Thea?
do you mind if I talk to her alone first?
it's been a while.
felicity able to pin her down?
she gave me an address.
you must be Mia's brother.
I see the resemblance.
is "Mia" around?
she works.
at the cafe.
Where's the cafe?
I'll show you.
thank you.
I didn't come all the way to South America to have you poison me, did I?
it's a meditative tea.
it will activate your mind and body.
I think I'm going to need a little bit more than tea to learn how to use one of those.
the Sohei Buddhist warriors believed that first you fight with the mind...
then your sword.
I remember when I was training to be a warrior.
I began just like you...
devastated by my wife's death.
the pain was unbearable.
like this.
you're out of your mind!
put your hand in here!
every warrior must learn the simple truth...
that pain is inevitable, and suffering is optional.
please, don't...
don't do what I think you're going to do!
you asked me to teach you.
no.
Aquí tienes.
good to see you.
you, too.
How...how did you...
well, it's not exactly the Amalfi Coast.
didn't you flunk Spanish?
more like skipped it altogether.
well, you look good.
I like your hair cut.
thank you.
Yeah, wanted it short, you know.
it gets hot down here.
I'm sorry I lied to you about it, Ollie.
I just needed some space.
it's ok.
you've had five months of it.
this isn't just a visit.
got one for you, too.
after mom, I understood why you left Starling.
but Thea, I miss you.
and I would really like it if you came home.
I miss you, too.
and I love you...
so much.
but I'm never coming back to Starling City.
I can't.
sorry.
there is strength in you, Thea.
I see it, even if you can't see it yourself.
I'm sorry, this...
this just isn't me.
I'm not like you.
I can't do this!
it's all right.
it's not your fault.
it's mine.
Q. C.stock up 10 bucks at the open.
that is love, ha!
Ah, miss Smoak, good morning...
I think.
I've been here all night.
my predecessor left things a little, um, what's the polite way to say this?
little wonky.
sorry if I'm rambling.
I'm a little over-caffeinated.
I just had three espressos.
speaking of coffee...
let me stop you right there!
I told myself that I would stand firm on a few points.
no late night emails, no personal errands, and definitely no coffee.
there'll be no espressos brought to you by me.
I stand very firm on that last point.
and I admire your conviction.
this is Jerry Conway, your executive assistant.
and I wanted to know if you'd like him to get you a coffee.
or are you just anti-latte in general?
Um...Executive assistant?
I think that's a yes on the latte.
thank you, Jerry.
thank you, Jerry.
should we get to work?
excellent.
applied Sciences.
Q. C.'s bleeding edge research division, till some wacko blew it up last year.
I'm sure they had their reasons.
the point is, it's the cornerstone for my plan to rebuild Queen Consolidated and thus the city.
I've had my people working day and night salvaging what they can, including this...
a file server containing Applied Science's design work.
it's not working, unfortunately, on account of being caught in a massive explosion.
you want me to access the data.
a brilliant mind at work already.
speaking of, I got to get back to work.
then why are you leaving your office?
Oh, I'm not.
I'm leaving yours.
this is Lyla's busy work, man you didn't have to tag along.
well, I don't know how to vacation like a normal person, Diggle.
what's the plan?
this spot's his usual dead drop.
Lyla sent me over this file photo.
just make sure he's all right.
got him.
I got you.
he's a friendly, Oliver.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
listen!
I'm with Lyla Michaels.
have you seen any capuchins today?
if that's a challenge code, I got to tell you, I'm not with A.R.G.U.S.
I'm just Lyla's baby daddy.
now, you didn't check in, Shaw.
she was worried, so she sent me to find you.
if you're lyin', you'll be picking your intestines up off this sidewalk.
that's fair enough.
Lyla gave me a security transcoder in my right jacket pocket.
pretty jumpy, Shaw.
better jumpy than dead.
copy that.
what's going on?
not here.
sorry, I had...
I had eyes on me all week, a whole follow team.
wait, Shaw.
what makes you so important?
I have hard Intel.
someone from Corto Maltese hacked into the server and acquired the A.R.G.U.S. actual.
they want to sell it.
did I mention I don't work for A.R.G.U.S?
the actual is an encrypted data omnibus.
it's a complete record of agent covers, personal details, affiliated soft targets...
whoa, whoa, whoa, soft targets...
as in family members?
Yeah, as in women and children.
you get why this is so important?
Hi, my name is Laurel, I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Laurel.
a week ago, I...
something happened.
something that I can't share with anyone for several complicated reasons.
I thought that I was going to want to drink...
but I didn't.
not even tempted, really.
but what I am is...
is I'm angry.
and I don't know what to do with it or...
or where to put it.
I just...
thank you for letting me share.
are there any other burning desires?
alcoholic.
Hi, Erica.
my boyfriend and me got into another fight last night.
some of you know, he still drinks, a lot.
and I said something.
I know I should have just kept my mouth shut.
I know I should just leave him, but...
I can't.
maybe there's a meeting I should be going to for that.
once a month, Erica gives a share like that - and it's getting worse.
Yeah.
do you know the boyfriend has eight assault charges against him?
and not just in Starling.
he's got warrants out on him as far off as Coast City.
and it takes everything in me not to go after a dirtbag like that, but the day the cops start bringing their badges into AA meetings, that's the day that the drunks stop coming.
I'm in position.
the sale of the actual is going down here.
only two of us.
you didn't want to call for back up?
that's the only insurance policy you're going to need.
they're here.
you're not worried about them seeing our ride?
how did you know the buy was happening?
I've been a station agent in Corto Maltese for three years now.
I got this third-world garbage dump wired.
what's wrong?
there's no buy, is there, Shaw?
sorry for lying to you, John.
well, partially lying.
there is a buy going down, just not till tomorrow.
I needed to get this first.
thanks for helping me decode the actual.
should have got the heavy duty ones.
I like your hair.
what are you and my brother like travel buddies now?
no, we're just worried about you.
Oliver said you weren't going to come back, so...
I figured I'd come here and try to convince you to.
well, you can't.
look, I get it, you're hurt.
I lied to you, I lied right to your face. But I...
I need you to know that when I said I wanted to leave Starling with you, that wasn't a lie.
I didn't just leave because of you, Roy.
my mother lied to me, my brother.
I had to get away from Starling City and all the secrets.
and I found myself here.
isn't it lonely here?
that's kind of what I like about it.
there's no one here who knows me or thinks of me as Thea Queen or Thea Merlyn.
no one who lies to me, or...
tries to protect me with secrets.
all I ever wanted was for you to be happy, Thea.
I'm sorry I got in the way of that.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
if being here instead of home makes you happy, then...
then you should stay.
are you ok?
you look a little tired.
I just haven't been sleeping much lately.
you take care.
what do you mean?
it's not your fault, it's mine.
I thought I could do this differently, but I can't.
I need to train you as I was trained.
treat you as my student, not my daughter.
what are you doing?!
the only way to forge steel is to temper it with fire.
stay away from me, you sick son of a bitch!
now we can begin.
why didn't you call me sooner?
I could have helped.
I didn't want you to worry, Lyla.
besides, I thought we could handle it.
well, we've hacked his email traffic.
he's got a buyer en route to Corto Maltese.
who?
the tech boys are still working on that.
but Waller's dispatched a wet team to your position.
they're not going to get here in time.
they might.
keep your powder dry.
copy that.
we're not going to keep our powder dry.
hell no.
Hey.
any luck raising our digital Lazarus from the dead?
the hard drive is toast.
and the power supply.
and...The actuator.
Ah, I'm sensing a pattern.
sorry, one second.
Hello?
Hey, Felicity, this is John.
where are you?
you wouldn't believe me if I told you.
are you near a computer?
kind of.
I'm looking for somebody in Corto Maltese.
I'm actually a little bit in the middle of a...
I need to know where he is.
I've emailed you everything I have on him.
...meeting right now.
I am so sorry.
it's a friend.
um, well, a few friends...
actually.
you know what, it's a long story.
why am I under the impression that you have a lot of stories, all of which are long?
you want me to come back later?
what? Sorry.
Hello?
Felicity, I need a favor.
are we favor friends now?
are we friends?
what? - Never mind, sorry.
Oh, dear god.
one second. One more second.
Hello?
we got cut off.
according to the file you sent me, this guy is somewhat of a hacker.
let me guess...
long story?
Yeah, the guy I'm looking for broke into A.R.G.U.S's system.
and he left a trail. It's faint...hacking-wise...
but with a little bit of luck, I will find him, or his laptop.
I will email you when I have something.
I'm having a bit of a day.
I need you to help me find someone by googling his phone or something.
pinging his GPS.
can I call you back?
is this what a typical day looks like for you?
believe it or not, this is better than most.
when Felicity has Shaw's location, I want you to text me and I'll be there.
Thea?
Oliver, I don't think she's going to change her mind on this.
she doesn't want to hear from anyone, and I don't blame her.
I mean, we both lied to her.
a lot.
I know, it's why it's time to tell her the truth.
Oliver, when you say "the truth..."
what happened the five years I was away, everything we've done since I've been back, all of it.
well, you might want to think about that for a second.
lies are what drove Thea away from Starling City in the first place.
the truth is the only thing that's going to bring her back.
except you won't be telling her the truth, will you?
you'll be telling her that her brother has been lying to her to her face, with almost pathological sincerity for the past two years.
she won't believe another word you say.
and you will lose her, Oliver, forever.
well, look around.
I've already lost her.
I don't have any other choice.
I hear you like to hit women.
how about one who likes to hit back?
you're right.
it's better when they hit back.
baby, baby, are you ok?
I'm so sorry.
I'm too relieved to be mad at you, I really am.
but, sweetheart...
this is crazy.
what the hell were you thinking going after that girl's boyfriend?
there's just something I needed to work out.
I know that the world isn't fair.
I know that it's a terrible place where...
where people deserve to get punished.
and they don't.
I just...
for one night, I needed the world to be different.
OK, Laurel, Laurel...
what's going on with you, huh?
you're not being yourself lately.
and now you're running around, you're tuning this guy up.
what are you doin'?!
baby, you can talk to me about anything.
you know that, right?
you know that.
I know.
talk to me, then.
Laurel, you're not the Arrow.
or your sister.
you promise me you'll never do anything like this again, ever!
I promise.
it was a mistake; I wasn't thinking.
if you want to stay in Corto Maltese, it's fine, but there's not much here in the way of sightseeing.
I need to talk to you.
look, between you and your new best friend Roy,
I'm pretty sure you guys have said everything.
I haven't.
not yet, anyway.
Roy showed me the note you left him.
and you were right about everything.
I have lied, I have kept secrets.
the truth is that if I tell you...
all the things that you don't know about me, that I might lose you forever.
I spent five years in the worst kind of hell, and there were things that happened, there were things that I did...
that if...
if you knew, you would see me differently.
no, I'll always see you as my big brother.
I mean, no matter what happened to you on that island, or who you became, it's the secrets you kept about my own life.
I mean, you lied to me about who my father was.
Malcolm may have been your blood.
robert was your father.
I lied to you about him, too.
dad wasn't the man we thought he was.
he was better.
and I've kept something from you because I just...
never wanted you to know.
dad made it off "The Gambit" with me.
you told me he drowned.
we made it to a life boat together.
there wasn't enough food and water for both of us...
so he killed himself.
and that is one secret that I'm telling you now because I need you to realize...
mom and dad, they sacrificed themselves so that we could live.
but if we're not together, then...
we're not even really alive.
you're my family.
and even if you don't need me...
I need you.
please just consider what I'm saying.
he's here.
so's his buyer.
I was expecting Armitage.
this country's soil is not worthy of Mr. Armitage.
do you have the item?
Where's the money?
and the transcoder?
we better go.
Where'd you get this?
our hotel room.
who are they?
could be A.R.G.U.S.
that's not A.R.G.U.S.
Suelten sus armas!
let's go.
go!
A.R.G.U.S.they know we're here.
which is why I got a bunch of renta-soldiers to secure the perimeter.
it's amazing how cheap you can buy an army for in this country.
behind you!
I never said I didn't know how to use a gun.
Lyla was your friend!
and you endangered her and her daughter for what, for a lousy payday!
not a payday.
it's my ticket out.
of what?
A.R.G.U.S!
you don't know the things Waller's made me do.
the person she turns you into.
that still gives you no right to put a bulls-eye on my family's back!
I had no choice.
but you do, John.
tell Waller I died.
tell her you put a bullet in me.
if only.
I've been thinking.
I want to go home.
to my brother.
and all his lies and secrets?
maybe you haven't come as far as I thought.
let me prove it to you.
impressive.
I had a good teacher.
looks like you're going home.
you let me win, didn't you?
I'll be seeing you soon.
safe flight.
thank you.
Yeah.
you ok?
she's not coming.
I'm sorry, Oliver.
you did everything you could, man.
I'm glad you changed your mind.
still not sure about flying commercial, though.
Thea, are you ok?
Yeah. I'm fine.
I didn't know the Arrow took vacations.
Hey!
what happened?
I'm fine. Please.
what happened?
I tried to do good.
it didn't work out.
I know that it probably sounds insane.
it probably is, but...
she gave me this.
and when I wear it, it makes me want to help people like she did.
like she's alive again.
I get it.
Sara had training.
she had years...
Oliver, I know.
which is why I need to start, and I need your help.
no.
No!
no.
I...
I want you to consider what would happen to your father if something happened to you.
Oliver, ever sense it happened,
I have had this fire inside of me that I can't get rid of with booze or pills.
I need another way!
and the other night, even though it went wrong it was the first time since Sara died where I haven't felt that fire.
I'm sorry, but I can't.
and even if I could, Sara would never forgive me.
Yeah.
love you.
I love you both.
the two of you were all I could think about.
I'm just trying to put her down.
that's ok, I just want to look at her for a while.
OK.
I have to head into the office.
so late?
I do whatever Amanda Waller asks, remember?
you ok?
Yeah. Just hurry back.
what's with this guy?
outstanding warrants for assault and battery in Coast City.
got an anonymous tip he was in Starling.
anonymous tip, huh?
that's a bad break, buddy.
all right.
when can I start?
do you know how many of QC's techs said this data was unrecoverable?
only all of them.
seems like this would be a good time to ask for a few days off, then.
you just started.
I know.
but...
my friend was struck by lightning and is in a coma.
well, was.
I don't know.
um, it's...
a long story.
see ya.
Thanks.
you did good over there.
I had a good teacher.
a judgmental, occasionally temperamental one, but...
those are the best kind.
did Thea seem...
different to you?
her hair's a lot shorter.
but that's not what you mean.
what do you mean?
I don't know.
she say anything?
she may be...
seeing somebody in Corto Maltese, or...
if Thea was with anybody else, I've got a feeling I'd be the last one to know.
where is she?
where is Sara?
my name is Oliver Queen.
after five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal...
to save my city.
now others have joined my crusade.
to them, I am Oliver Queen.
to the rest of Starling City, I am someone else.
I am something else.
there's a lot of good people, they lose someone, they lose themselves, which is why they come in here to work off that rage.
Roy, are you OK?
you look a little tired.
I just haven't been sleeping much lately.
if I had accepted my life, I would be a cocktail waitress in Vegas like my mother, and I never would have believed some crazy guy in a hood when he told me I could be more than just some it girl.
you're not moving very quickly this morning.
I just didn't sleep much last night.
you're not boxing, girl.
you're not even fighting.
you're just lashing out.
come on!
impressive.
how do normal people spend their morning?
four...
five.
Mrs. Fernandes!
I already told you, I haven't seen your...cat.
I haven't seen him, either.
or is the cat a girl?
was I being misogynist just now?
or is it misogynistic? I never know.
Ray...What are you...
nice place you've got here. Lots of space.
so it occurred to me this morning, what's the one thing that Queen Consolidated has that we don't use to its maximum potential?
a doorbell?
have you heard of a process called cogeneration?
I haven't even looked at a cup of coffee yet.
well, cogeneration is...
the repurposing of waste heat given off by electricity production.
exactly. It's a principle of thermodynamic efficiency, which occurred to me could be applied to a building which generates over 240, 000 watts of electricity.
like Queen Consolidated.
I did some preliminary calculations on the drive over.
you want to sell QC's excess energy back to the city?
if by "sell" you mean "give away for free," then yes.
energy is something that should be given freely to the masses.
uh, you still haven't found Mrs. Fernandes' cat, I'm guessing.
Oh, my beautiful girl!
very friendly with your neighbors, I see.
mom...
mom?
what are you doing here?
honey, I came to see you.
for a visit.
look, look, look.
didn't you get my text?
mom, to send a text, you actually have to press "send" on the text.
Oh, OK, not a big deal, I'll do it right now.
are you adopted?
hmm.
Oh! I'm so sorry.
I didn't know you had somebody staying over.
Oh, no, he's not staying over.
he's not, like, we're not...
this is my boss.
it's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Smoak.
Hi. You can call me Donna.
mom...
I'm Ray.
Oh, my god.
you're that watch guy.
we like to call them smart wearables.
I bought one of your watches!
look!
see?
felicity here thinks I don't pay attention to all of her tech things.
Yeah, I see you've got a 3GS.
I'm actually wearing a prototype for the new six.
Yeah, it basically replaces your computer.
very fancy. You know what?
it's yours.
Oh, no. Seriously?
I'll let you two catch up.
let me know what you think about those cogeneration numbers, and Donna, hope to see you again soon.
well, don't count on it.
she'll probably be really busy...
planning my funeral after I die of embarrassment.
you are standing in an open field west of the White House with a boarded front door.
what are you doing?
I just finished coding a Linux emulator for Zork.
it is Pitch Black.
you are likely to be eaten...by a Grue.
I guess you'll have to protect me.
why can't you just quietly have sex under a comforter like most college students?
you found an exploitable note?
now I just need your super computer virus to crack the firewall.
I really wish you wouldn't call my x-axis bi-numeric algorithm a "super-virus."
spoofing the IP, switching to MD6, and...
somebody take a screenshot.
we have to post this to hacker forum, to brag that we actually got in!
hold on.
30 seconds until the firewall goes back up.
Cooper, what are you doing?
I think the world would be a much better place if there weren't any student loans, don't you?
you can't wipe out all the loans, they'll never think it's a glitch.
they're going to track us down and find us!
10 seconds.
I'm not going to jail for you, Cooper, and you shouldn't, either.
I almost had it!
what were you thinking?!
ever heard of hacktivisim?
instead of posting to web forums, we could be doing some real good in the world.
and going to prison in the process.
it's all about what you want to be when you grow up, babe...
a hacker, or a hero?
Hello?
speedy?
just signed the lease.
what do you think?
Thea, you're signing a lease on a spot that you can't possibly afford.
I can, actually.
whose money?
Malcolm Merlyn's.
his estate, I mean.
when I left Starling City, I mentioned something to Ned Foster about Malcolm being my father, and there's a lot of legal stuff I didn't understand, and...
he left you money?
the entire world thinks he's dead.
so, yes, legally, his estate goes to his last living heir.
and, ahem, last week when you told me that you had investors for the club, that was a lie?
I was afraid you wouldn't react well to the idea of me taking his money.
it's blood money, Thea!
you don't know what Malcolm Merlyn is capable of!
I know what his money is capable of...
renting me this really sweet loft.
listen to me.
he's alive, and if you take his money, he has a hold on you.
I think you're being a little melodramatic.
I'm his daughter, OK?
he's not going to put me in danger.
he's responsible for the death of 503 innocent people, including your brother.
now that is a card that you do not get to play.
you are my brother, but that does not mean you have the right to tell me what I can do with my life.
I am my own person.
the movers are coming tomorrow, so you can stop by with popcorn or not stop by at all.
Oh, please.
what is going on?
you OK?
disguised voice: We are Brother Eye.
judgment has been rendered against this city.
its sentence carried out.
an earthquake.
a siege.
this is what comes next...
a new life you will live on your knees, and it will take nothing more than a push of a button.
we are in control now.
and this is just the beginning.
let there be light.
Ooh, a nightclub.
you know, I'm really not dressed for a nightclub.
Really?
you think?
my friend owns the place.
he just needs a little help turning the power back on, so...
why don't you...
come, come. Stay put.
stay here?
right here.
OK. - Mm-hmm.
Hey. Any luck tracking this...
hello.
Hi.
uh, please tell me this is your friend.
no.
mom, this is Oliver... - Queen.
very nice to meet you.
Yes, it's so nice to meet you, too.
how many billionaires do you know?
Diggle, meet Felicity's mom.
mom.
John Diggle. - Hi.
very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.
Oh! Hello!
who is this little nugget?
this is my daughter Sara.
Ooh! - - Mom. Mom. Ahem, mom!
what?
we have to go downstairs.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to stop you.
I'm so sorry. Little baby moment.
so sorry.
it's great to meet you, finally.
Yes, yes, definitely.
why is Sara here?
Lyla's on on assignment in Santa Prisca and the nanny called in sick.
why not, Oliver, who's she going to tell?
well, she...
I'm not comfortable with her down there.
God help me.
my mother loves babies.
Really?
whoever this Brother Eye group is somehow got access to the city's protected network and uploaded a system-wide virus.
oliver: Any way to trace it?
no, it deleted itself as soon as it completed its task.
they said the power outage was just the beginning.
then let's find them before there's a next time.
Hey, Laurel, are you all right? Did you get here OK?
I'm fine. I was close.
but why do I get the emergency services alert?
why don't they call the district attorney?
cause he's visiting his niece in Coast City.
you are the acting district attorney.
Congratulations.
Hello, Detective...Captain.
look, you're on this Brother Eye thing, right?
we are.
good,'cause there's no one here knows computers better than you.
no, for the last time, I am not interested in buying a fake ID.
I am hanging up now. Bye.
my mom says hi.
you still angry at me?
I was past the firewall and into the account network.
I had 3, 000 debts wiped by the time you pulled the plug on me.
well, think of how many accounts you could go to prison for if I hadn't stopped you.
relax.
the DNS wasn't configured.
they can't backtrace me.
they can.
the subroot was configured.
by accessing the accounts, you set off a packets feedback that anyone could trace back to.
you are gorgeous when you're being a chicken.
come on, I'm serious. - I'm serious.
don't move You are under arrest.
What?!
No! No, No, No!
you're under arrest for violation of U. S.Code title 18, section 1030.
don't!
you have the right to remain silent.
let go of him, let him go!
brother Eye: We said this was just the beginning.
electricity is not the only power in the city.
consider money, for example.
the banks are next to go dark.
your beloved dollars wiped away as your accounts will finally all be equal, at zero.
Felicity... - I'm working on it.
I set up some trace IP packets before Brother Eye's last broadcast.
as soon as he opened up the channel, I scooped up the bread crumbs.
bread crumbs we can follow?
I hope so.
Where's Captain Lance?
coordinating squad car patrols for dispatch.
Why? What's wrong?
there's a situation at Starling National.
send in an ESU squad.
sorry, ma'am, but you don't have the power to...
I'm acting district attorney.
the city charter gives me operational authority in times of crisis, which this clearly is.
I'm not letting anyone get hurt.
send in an ESU now.
what's going on?
SCPD just dispatched a riot squad to Starling National.
it's like fighting a fire with gasoline.
suit up.
this group is ordered to disperse!
back!
back behind the line!
Oliver, the riot is getting out of control.
you need to hurry up.
back!
back behind the line!
get away from the bank!
the teargas is dispersing them, but we can't calm the entire city, Felicity.
the trace led me to the virus they're using.
I'm combing through now.
no, No, No, No, No, No!
what's wrong?
the virus...
I can't stop it!
how do you know?
because it's mine.
I wrote it five years ago.
OK, OK, before you say anything, just know that I never imagined the virus being used for something like this.
I mean, sure, I could have imagined it.
I actually have a very vivid imagination.
like cronuts! I had a vision of them before...
Hey.
relax.
take a deep breath.
good.
now start at the beginning.
I was in this, I guess you could call it a group, in college.
we were "hacktivists."
for lack of a better word.
civil disobedience via the World Wide Web.
I created this.
that could give us root access to any infected server.
we could expose government fraud and start virtual sit-ins and digitally deface criminals.
I guess you could say it was my first attempt at being a hero.
why didn't you tell me about any of this?
do we even know a fraction of what happened to you the five years that you were away?
who else had access to the program?
he was my...
I had a boyfriend in college, and Myron was his roommate.
and he was a member of this hacktivist group?
what about the boyfriend?
Oh, he couldn't have done this.
he's...
not in the picture, but Myron always had somewhat of an edge.
can you get me an address?
sure.
just one small problem...
not small, necessarily, but short.
just take the alleyway entrance.
are you OK?
I've been better.
I talked it over with Myron, and I'm going to tell them I wrote the super virus.
you can't do that.
I can't let you rot in prison, Coop.
you can't tell them you wrote that virus...
cause I already told them I did.
I always said I'd protect you from the grues.
this isn't... - It's better this way.
I wiped out those loans.
there's no reason both of us should be in prison.
I love you.
love you, too.
Hey. Got a minute?
congratulations, you called in a riot squad, you nearly started one!
and! You did it behind my back.
you were busy, and the situation at Starling National was escalating.
you escalated it, Laurel!
please tell me you can at least see that now.
OK.
I'm sorry.
Laurel, baby...
what's gotten into you?
you're angry, you're distant, you're reckless.
tell me you're not boozing again.
no.
then what the hell's going on?
because this isn't you.
look, I haven't said anything because I was hoping that you would say something,
I can't talk about it with you.
OK.
but listen, you don't have to talk about it with me.
but talk about it with somebody.
cause secrets hurt, baby.
sometimes more than the truth.
back-up generator keeps that locked. Or...
so they told me.
I could never get that stupid door to open.
contractor says the entire sub level is flooded, though.
it was a water main break.
what are you doing here, Ollie?
a super hacker is trying to take over the city and I'm worried about you.
I still get to be worried, right?
Yes.
and if you really have to, you can even be judgmental...
occasionally.
someone told me recently that a family is pretty precious.
and love, in spite of everything, is what makes it precious.
right now, the Queen family is just you and me.
so let it just be you and me.
and don't take Merlyn's money.
I'm trying to meet you halfway here, Ollie.
the other half is up to you.
you have failed this city.
tell him he has to retract all the infected packets from subsystem mainframes within the city.
tell me how to shut down the virus.
do it now.
you think I'm behind the cyber attacks?
sounds like a Brother Eye to me.
I swear to god, I'm not.
I head up the IT department of an accounting firm.
I drive a hybrid. It's blue.
I'm one of the sheep lunatics like these guys hate.
why would I do this?
digital fingerprints are all over this code.
there's an x-axis bionumeric algorithm.
the code's an x-axis bionumeric algorithm that you've used before!
in college.
my roommate and his girlfriend.
Yeah, yeah, sure, we developed it.
we called it a super virus, but that doesn't mean I'm the eye guy!
have you tried Felicity Smoak?
she's innocent.
then it's got to be someone else.
after we graduated, I might have showed the code off to a few people.
who were they?! - I don't remember.
it was five years ago.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
we were just kids playing with matches.
I am running out of expletives!
we need to track down whoever Myron shared your code with.
I hacked all of his emails and all his text messages from five years ago and all I got was depressed.
OK. What about your ex?
I already told you, he didn't do it.
Why?
because he's your ex-boyfriend?
because...
my senior year of college, Cooper and I did a stupid thing.
he got arrested and he went to prison.
so he went to prison.
maybe he got out.
he didn't.
how do you know?
because he's dead.
he hung himself before sentencing.
Felicity, I...
I just really need to be alone right now.
Ah. I'm glad you're here.
when I launched my plan to rebrand Starling into Star City,
I didn't count on cyber terrorism.
I'm looking for a partner with whom to drown my sorrows and you definitely look like someone who could use a drink.
I'm sorry.
my mother...
I didn't have anywhere else to go.
you OK?
you're an inventor.
did you ever create anything that you didn't think was important, turns out, it's very important?
of course.
those turn out to be the best inventions.
not always.
you want to talk about it?
of course I'd find you here.
could you just wait one second? - Wait?
I'm sorry; I've already waited two hours for you at your apartment, and before that, it was two hours in the club.
is there any way that you could be anywhere else but here?
Thanks, Mom.
that wasn't the least bit mortifying.
only half as bad as parents' week in freshman year.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I've been reduced to stalking my own daughter.
because you can't seem to comprehend that I can't make the whole world stop because you decided to show up on my doorstep.
I have responsibilities!
Yes, I know, Felicity.
you have work.
you have work, work, work, work.
no, No, No,you don't understand.
it is so much more than work.
but all you care about it my love life or how much cleavage I don't show.
that is not true!
that is completely true!
and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I'm terminally single.
I'm sorry I have an actual job.
I'm sorry that I don't dress like a porn star!
which I realize is a compliment to you.
so I'm so sorry that I am such a disappointment to you!
I'm not as smart as you, Felicity, or your father.
I know that.
even when you were only six years old, I could barely keep up with you two.
and...
maybe I wasn't always the mother you wanted, but I was always there.
I stayed and I tried.
he...
he left me.
he left us.
but when I look at you, all I see is what he gave you.
there is nothing of me...
in you.
you know, it's so funny. I was...
I was always so afraid that one day, you were going to leave me, too.
but now I finally realize...
you already did.
there are people on the other end of this thing, right?
people we can hit?
we need Felicity.
I'm here.
the super virus has 3, 407 traceable access notes.
hopefully I didn't put a firewall in every one, though.
of course I did, because I'm smarter than that.
seriously, if I had two less IQ points, we never would have gotten in this mess.
are you all right?
Where's your mom? - I don't know.
probably back at my place, wishing she had a different daughter.
it's a long story.
so go see her. Take an hour.
the city is under attack.
you're our best chance of stopping it, but not like this, Felicity.
your head's not in the game.
I will get it together.
your tracer hack's running.
take an hour.
go talk to your mom.
I do not have anything to say to her.
you know, earlier today,
Thea told me that she literally has to put up with me because family is precious.
and that it's love, in spite of everything, that makes it precious.
go.
Where's Sara?
the nanny came to pick her up.
said he was from a company called A. R.G. U.S.
I don't know, I've never heard of it.
I think that's the point.
well, I'm glad you're still here.
you are a terrible liar, Felicity.
might be the only thing we have in common.
I have blonde hair.
you dye it.
you're right.
we're different, and it's always going to be that way.
and it's not easy...
no, you know what, it's...
it's totally my fault for just showing up here uninvited.
seriously. I think I just got so excited about this free flight.
what?
my plane ticket.
I got an email that said I'd won some contest.
free first class round trip to Starling.
email?
mom.
someone wanted you to be here.
mom!
baby! - Mom!
are you OK? - I'm OK.
Oh! Oh, thank god!
where are we?
felicity Smoak, just the woman I wanted to see.
what the hell do you want from me?!
who are you?
you really don't know?
I thought you'd never forget your first love.
you died.
they told me...
that I committed suicide, right?
the NSA needed a hacker with game for cyber espionage, and I needed to not be in prison for the rest of my life.
because of what the NSA wanted me doing, it was...
advantageous for me to be dead.
when I found out you died, I was devastated.
I loved you.
I loved you, too.
after I finished my time with the NSA, I was going to find you.
to let you in on this.
and then I discovered you'd become this corporate lap dog.
broke my heart.
you changed.
if you ever thought I was capable of doing something like this, you never really knew me at all.
when you wrote this virus, Felicity, you knew exactly what it was capable of.
all I'm doing is unleashing the true potential of what you made.
Why?!
this isn't who you are!
five years with the NSA, you learn a lot about how the world works.
how we can't be saved or salvaged.
how it's every man for himself.
you also learn that when a city bank goes under, say, financial cyber attack, the mayor will reach out to the Treasury Department and request an influx of fresh cash.
cash which is transported by armored trucks navigating according to a closed-end GPS system, which directs them to City Deposit.
if the drivers deviate from the route, the trucks are shut down.
but you're going to hack into the system and direct the cash to come here.
it was about money, and I'm the sell-out?
no. No, babe.
you're the one who's going to help me.
see, breaking into the treasury's asymmetric encryption is beyond even my capabilities.
I'm going to politely decline.
don't!
that's why I flew some motivation into town for you.
she's been MIA for over an hour.
well, you did tell her to go home.
I just had an A. R.G. U.S. agent pick up Sara there.
I could have them go back, check things out.
Yep.
OK.
Felicity's never more than five feet from her phone.
something's wrong.
No! No!
that terminal's configured to only connect with the Treasury's IP.
I mention this so you don't try to do anything stupid, like alert the police.
I'm so sorry.
mom...
right now's not really the best time, OK?
but it might be the last time, hon, and I want you to know that all I've ever wanted...
is for you to be happy.
let's say we hit pause on the Dr. Phil episode.
it's done!
it's done.
that quick?
there's a reason you wanted me, right?
they'll be at your front door in five minutes.
guards will be armed.
stay put, OK?
just because we used to screw doesn't mean I won't use this gun.
what's that?
huh?
Oh, that, that's the watch.
it's the watch Mr. Palmer gave me.
it chimes on the hour, and I guess when we're about to be killed.
we're not going to be killed.
we're going to get out of here.
it basically replaces your computer.
you know I don't know what that means.
it means it has Wifi.
Really?
when they're in range...
you know what to do.
I did what you wanted.
you don't have to kill us.
Really?
who would have thought that I'd become the grue?
Hey! Hey.
you want to wave that gun at me, fine, but don't you dare threaten my daughter.
here I thought you were all nails and hair.
try single mom who's worked 60 hour weeks in six inch heels for tips in order to raise that genius child you see right there.
I may not understand all this cyber whatever, but I know without that gun, you wouldn't last 10 seconds against my girl.
too bad she doesn't have 10 seconds.
oliver: I disagree!
put the gun down.
you were always good, Felicity.
so good.
but so am I.
cooper: Motion sensored.
they can hit most any target.
something's wrong.
clear.
this is all your fault.
mom! Mom, are you OK?
are you OK?
before, you were right to keep pressing on Cooper.
turns out he's not as dead as I thought.
I've had some experience with that.
and you learn not to judge.
Yes.
are you OK?
I guess so.
old lovers have a way of opening old wounds.
lovers...
sounds creepy no matter how you say it.
I want you to know that whatever experiences you had to go through,
I'm glad that you did.
they shaped the person you are today.
and you know how I feel about her.
I should head out.
you were right.
we have to love our families.
no matter what.
you here?
what happened to you?
this is me now.
you were right.
something is going on with me.
and my father, he...
he noticed it as well.
he told me I should open up to someone.
my sister, she...
she died.
well, she...
she was murdered.
did they ever catch the...
no. No one knows that she's gone except for me.
and I can't tell anyone.
so, yes.
Yes, I am angry.
I'm going to help you with that.
see, before, Laurel, you were swinging at your sister's killer.
that's a target you're never going to hit.
don't train for that.
all right, train for yourself.
see, now I know how to teach you.
so what's it going to be?
red or black?
black.
definitely black.
it was popcorn, right?
you said you were meeting me halfway.
this is me doing my part.
I missed you, Speedy.
let's not miss each other anymore.
I mean, it was so much easier to be in each other's lives when we were underneath the same roof.
So...Why don't you move in with me?
I mean, clearly I have enough space.
and I...
I swear once the club starts making a profit,
I will donate all of Malcolm's money to an earthquake relief charity thing.
I can live with that.
you got a TV in here?
well, I'm officially off.
I mean, my flight doesn't leave till tonight, but I figured you'd be working, so we can...
we can just say good-bye now.
you were right.
about what?
I haven't always been appreciative of you.
you were always there for me every day, and night.
so if I haven't said thank you enough, thank you.
but you were wrong, too.
Mm-hmm?
when you said all you saw in me was dad; there was nothing of you in me.
well, I can't really explain it, but over the past two years,
I have been through a lot.
and I have learned that I am a lot tougher than I thought.
that...
I get from you.
don't cry.
so I took another look at those cogeneration numbers.
you want to...
Oh.
hi again.
Hi.
how's that new smart wearable working out for you?
Oh, it's, um, it's a real life saver.
Yeah.
ray, I can't come into work today.
I am...
calling in sick.
feel better.
thank you.
see you later.
that's actually pretty genius.
Hello, Sara.
what are you doing here?
my name is Oliver Queen.
for 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal... survive.
Oliver Queen is alive.
now I will fulfill my father's dying wish...
to bring down those who are poisoning my city.
to do this, I must become someone else.
I must become... Something else.
the company Mrs. Queen invested in doesn't exist.
tempest purchased a warehouse in Starling City.
I could never really tell if the playboy thing was all an act, but I guess after a while, it doesn't really matter.
he's a vigilante. He's a damn criminal.
here's the security footage from the Exchange building.
what do you want me to look for?
I want you to look for anything that's out of the ordinary.
what is that? Play that again.
Oliver Queen, you're under arrest on suspicion of obstruction of justice, aggravated assault, trespassing...
are you out of your mind?! - and murder.
dinner.
Ah, come... hey, I got an idea, why don't you let me shoot that thing and you can go pick up the bloody, dead, disgusting animal.
what?
try. Breathe.
everything, breathe.
breathe, aim... Fire.
here.
aim that tree.
breathe.
what does that mean?
you will die badly.
get.
wait, wait!
you can't leave me here! Don't do this to me, please!
No! Please! I didn't do anything!
the police think they know who I am.
they think I'm the vigilante.
the man in the hood terrorizing the city's criminals.
they also think they have me trapped.
that I have no way out.
they're only half right.
this is a mistake.
I'll be asking you a few questions, standard stuff for the report.
have you been arrested before?
that's ok, I know the answer to that one, plenty of times.
like I said, this is a mistake.
far as I can tell, the only mistake I made was not shooting you down at the docks when I had a chance.
I am not who you think I am.
Oh, you're exactly who I think you are.
you're a dangerous menace who doesn't care about who he hurts, except now you're doing it with bows and arrows instead of trust funds and yachts.
detective... You hate me. I get it.
but that doesn't make me a vigilante.
no. The security camera footage of you at the Unidac auction with a green hood does that pretty well.
and as I said again, I ran into the stairwell once I heard the shooting.
I saw a duffel that I thought maybe belonged to the shooter.
I grabbed it, looked inside and saw... A hood.
and what about harassing Adam Hunt?
that just happened to take place right across the street from your little homecoming bash.
those were coincidences. - No.
when they pile up like that, it becomes evidence.
his parents are here. - Tell them to wait.
I want to see my son.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation here!
detective Lance, I know you hate my family, but I had no idea that you'd go so far to arrest my son without any grounds whatsoever!
I have solid grounds, and I have evidence.
which you can present to Mr. Queen's attorney when he gets here.
until then, this interrogation is over, Detective.
sure. You have 15 minutes.
detective Lance appears to be on some personal vendetta.
he is.
he blames me for the death of his daughter.
he also thinks that I dress up in a green hood and shoot people... With arrows.
the important thing is not to say anything until your attorney gets here.
fine. I want Laurel.
Oliver... I don't think your ex-girlfriend can be counted on to be objective here.
she knows me better than anyone.
she knows that I could never be this guy.
Walter, you say Lance has a vendetta?
Yes. - I think Laurel can get him off of it.
he raised her to do the right thing.
that includes representing an innocent man.
so... Mom. Please.
Mrs. Queen! What are you... - It's Oliver.
something's happened. - It's been all over the news.
these charges are ludicrous.
I know.
can I ask you, who's representing him?
well, that's why I'm here.
he wants you to represent him. - Me?
Yes. I told him it was a bad idea, but to be frank, I am desperate.
he says if you don't represent him, then he doesn't want any attorney.
Mrs. Queen, my father is the arresting officer.
Yes.
and I don't think it's a good idea for me to represent someone who I've been involved with.
listen, I am sorry for what your family is going through...
no apologies.
your idealism, I think, is why my son, for all his mistakes, is so smitten with you.
regardless, it was a bad idea on his part, and I am sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable.
docket 81941, people vs. Oliver Queen.
murder, aggravated assault, assault with intent, menacing and trespassing.
Where's your attorney, Mr. Queen?
I'm representing myself, judge.
I'm not sure that's the wisest course, Mr. Queen.
I think it is.
I'm innocent.
then we'll consider that your plea.
thank you. - Now, as to bail...
your Honor, Mr. Queen's family owns a pair of private jets, and, well, on the subject of their wealth,
I would point out that there is virtually no bail amount that can guarantee his presence at trial.
so then I guess it's a good thing that the people's case is so circumstantial.
Dinah Laurel Lance, Your Honor.
I'd like to file my appearance on behalf of the defendant.
Mr. Queen's wealth should not deprive him of the right to be released on bail while under the presumption of innocence.
he is a flight risk. - Then minimize the risk.
the defendant is willing to submit to home confinement and electronic monitoring through the wearing of a UKG45 administrated ankle device.
no, he wouldn't. - Sold.
your Honor... - Bail is set at $15 million. $5 million bond.
defendant to see probation for the fitting of a GPS device.
I knew you couldn't resist saving my ass.
you're going to make me regret this, aren't you?
no. It's going to be like old times.
fortunately for you with the legal case, there's no way that you're this vigilante.
I agree. - Because he's actually trying to make a difference.
we both know that's not really your style.
mom. It's not that bad.
OK. This device has a direct line into the precinct.
stay on the property, you're golden.
any questions? - Yes.
I'm having a sizable get together here tomorrow evening, and there is a better than likely chance it spills into the outdoor pool.
pool, that's fine. Step on the grass, they're sending a SWAT team to forcibly subdue you.
thank you, officer. - Of course.
a "sizable get together"?
I'm confined to this house for the foreseeable future.
I might as well make the most of it.
and this party is going to be themed.
I'm thinking prison, uh, burning man meets "Shawshank Redemption."
the invite says,"come before Oliver Queen gets off.
maybe a party's not in the best of taste, you know, considering the circumstances.
Tommy, the circumstances are why we're having the party in the first place.
I want people to know that I'm not worried about any of this.
well, that makes one of us.
before you start yelling... - Why would I yell?
you're only defending the man that killed your sister.
Oliver did not kill Sarah!
if it wasn't for him, she wouldn't have been on that boat.
have you consider the possibility that that's the reason you're trying to make him out to be this... this menace?
no, it is the video tape, is the suspicious timing, that is the reason!
this is Oliver Queen we're talking about.
he wrecks fancy cars and he dates models.
he doesn't kill people.
no, he just uses them, like he used Sarah and like he used you, and he's only asked you to be his lawyer to get at me.
no, he asked me to be his lawyer to get through to you.
you hate the hood and you hate Oliver, and you want more than anything for them to be the same person.
but Oliver isn't the reason why Sarah died.
or the reason mom left.
I don't have to listen to this.
by the way... You're not the only one who misses them.
Yup?
thank you for coming. Shut the door.
I guess it was just a matter of time before the police caught up with you.
except they didn't.
Oliver, they got you on video.
I knew the security camera was there, just like I knew the police would review the footage and arrest me.
all part of the plan.
so you wanted to get arrested?
well, I returned to Starling City and a few days later, the vigilante appears.
sooner or later, somebody was going to make the connection.
so what part of serving yourself up to the cops will help you avoid going to prison for the rest of your life?
there's more to it.
well, there better be, for your sake, because your family is freaking out downstairs.
Oliver, your mother and your sister just got you back, and now you're going to put them through a trial, maybe even worse?
don't you care?
of course I care.
the mission comes first.
who is he?
Leo Mueller. German arms dealer.
suspected in the theft of a hundred m249 squad automatic weapons.
OK...
last night he arrived in Starling City to sell the guns.
Oliver, don't you imagine there's enough trouble you're in this week than to go after this guy?
I imagine what would happen if a street gang got their hands on military-grade hardware.
I imagine our city's streets turned into a war zone.
but you're under house arrest, Oliver, which means you can't just go after this guy.
look, for now, I would just like you to shadow Mueller.
I would like you to track his movements.
I want to know where the buy is happening.
OK.
and how am I supposed to track him?
well, you know us billionaire vigilantes... we do love our toys.
Oh, well, that's sweet.
you wanted to see me, sir?
no. I didn't.
in fact, this meeting isn't taking place.
how long have you been head of security at Queen consolidated, Josiah?
going on seven years now, sir.
sounds about right.
but what I'm about to tell you will test the bounds of your discretion.
you're aware of the "Queen's Gambit," Robert Queen's ill-fated yacht?
well, I found it.
sir, the boat went down in the North China sea five years ago.
which is why my discovery of its remains in a warehouse downtown was unexpected, to say the least.
I want you to transfer those remains to a secure location. Can I count on you?
what's going on, sir?
that's very much what I'm trying to determine.
thank you both for coming.
no, thank you. It's nice to get out of the house.
I'll cut right to it. Detective Lance arrested your client without consulting my office first.
so congratulations. I am willing to consider a plea in this case.
absolutely not.
Mr. Queen spent five years in seclusion on a deserted island, cut off from civilization.
it is quite possible he's suffering from some form of post traumatic stress.
given that, we would support a plea of insanity.
conditional on a period of indeterminate incarceration at a psychiatric facility.
no, thank you. I'm not crazy.
finally something we agree on.
he's not a nut, he's a killing machine.
actually, I'm neither.
there is nothing you can say to me that I would believe.
I'll take a polygraph.
uh, polygraphs are inadmissible.
in front of the jury. I'll take a polygraph in front of him.
he's the one I need to convince.
I'm going to need a minute.
you're looking at life in prison.
what Spencer just offered you is a gift.
I'm not crazy. I am innocent.
I kind of want to take the polygraph.
and if I take it and I fail, then... I will consider making a deal.
fine.
I'll set up the poly.
and I will tell Spencer that we're not pleading out, but Oliver, you have a family.
friends. People who actually care about you.
so don't, for one second, think you're the only person with something to lose here.
I'll be right back.
please, sit. You're making me feel rude.
I do apologize for my men's treatment of you.
they're... they're trained to view any stranger as hostile.
I'm Edward Fyers, by the way.
and you are?
I'm Oliver Queen.
I was shipwrecked here.
I don't... Know for how long.
my family has money.
they have lots of money you would be...
you'd be really well compensated for my rescue.
well, I look forward to that.
but for the moment, let's just talk.
about what?
well, for instance... This gentleman.
do you know him?
no. - No?
no. Who's he?
you're a poor liar.
I've been polite.
I'll offer you one more chance before my manners leave me.
Hey, hey. I don't know this guy.
I thought I was on this island all by myself.
do you know what this island is named?
we're on Lian Yu... Mandarin for "purgatory," and I can make it feel like hell.
I don't know why you're protecting him.
you're young, foolish.
perhaps you don't know why, either.
think on that when you're begging for death.
he's yours now.
Hey, sweetie.
one of the workers left a keg too far from the bar.
can you ask them to move it please?
I got the ankle... thingie.
I don't want to set off a SWAT invasion.
all this stuff?
it's going to be fine, I promise.
Yeah, well, when you and dad left on the yacht, you promised me I'd see you in a few days.
which didn't happen.
this is different than that.
I didn't do any of this stuff, you know that. Right?
you're out all the time.
you have those scars, and since you've been back, you've been acting really weird.
none of this makes me some Robin Hood wannabe.
and you get me this.
I mean, it's an arrowhead.
Oh, man.
Thea, I bought that in the gift shop of the Beijing airport.
now I'm sort of happy I didn't buy you the shot glass with the panda on it, 'cause then you'd be worried I was panda man.
you know, I knew you couldn't be this person.
I-I just... I can't lose you again.
deal.
Moira. Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Yes. Could you please make this quick?
I'm in the midst of somewhat of a family emergency.
Yes, of course.
it's all over the local news.
possibly even national.
well, I know what you're thinking. - Do you?
my son is not the man targeting the list.
the charges are preposterous.
not according to the district attorney, assistant district attorney, investigating Detective in the police department that filed charges against him.
that Detective has a vendetta against my family.
Why? Is there something untoward about your family?
if so, something really needs to be done about that.
is your name Oliver Queen?
you don't know who I am, Detective?
the questions are to calibrate the polygraph.
is your name Oliver Queen? - Yes.
were you born in Starling City May 16th, 1985?
Yes.
is your hair blue? - No.
have you ever been to Iron Heights prison?
no.
are you the man in this picture?
where can I find the man in this picture?
no.
you steal 40 million dollars off Adam Hunt? - No, I didn't.
were you marooned on an island called Lian Yu for 5 years? - Yes.
how is that even relevant?
I don't need to show relevance, but since you asked, whatever happened to your client on that island turned him into a cold blooded killer.
No!
the physician that examined you reported that 20% of your body is covered in scar tissue.
the machine won't work unless you ask a question.
did that happen to you there?
Yes.
when you came back, you told everyone that you were alone on that island.
are you claiming that your scars were... Self-inflicted?
no.
I wasn't alone.
I didn't want to talk about what happened to me on the island.
why not? - Because the people that were there tortured me.
have you killed anyone?
Yes.
when I asked your daughter Sara to come on my father's yacht with me.
I killed your daughter.
I'd have to study the data, but just eyeballing it, he's telling the truth.
can I assume that you'll be recommending.
ms. Spencer to drop all charges against my client?
no.
I know a guilty man when I see one.
he is guilty, whether you can see it or not.
Hi, everybody!
I'm very touched that you came to celebrate with me before I am sent up the river.
closest neighbors are six miles away, so don't worry about the noise.
actually, on second thought... Let's wake those losers up!
if you think this is what prison's like, you are in for a rude awakening.
mueller's car has been parked in the warehouse district of the Glades for 45 minutes.
Yeah, that's a good place for an arms deal.
OK, since this is going down tonight, what do we do, drop a dime on Mueller with the cops?
no, the man in the hood.
he's going to stop them.
Oliver, you can't leave the house.
it doesn't have to be me in the hood.
that's why you threw this ridiculous party?
so you have a hundred witnesses placing you here at the house while I'm supposed to be across town dressed as a vigilante?
I thought that it was going to be good enough just for you to be seen in the hood.
I didn't count on Mueller showing up and I didn't count on the possibility that the Glades could be flooded with machine guns.
look.
I promise, it was never my intention to put you in harm's way.
Oliver, I didn't think joining your crusade was ever going to be risk-free.
I just don't like being played.
now you might have gotten used to lying to everyone else in your life, but I'm the one guy you don't lie to.
you're right.
I'm sorry.
so am I going to jail?
no, man.
I got to stop an arms deal.
Hello?
Mr. Steel, I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
this is Mike Vogel down in security.
but I have some sad news for you.
the company's head of security, Josiah Hudson, was in a car accident tonight.
he's dead, sir.
hello.
do we have a legal meeting or something?
because I have friends over.
do you think maybe you can tear yourself away from this inappropriately themed rave for a couple minutes?
I can't remember the last time that I've been in this room.
I can. Halloween, 2005.
we were getting ready for Tommy's party.
Ah. Yes.
I wore those horrible fishnets.
I thought you looked good.
listen... I just wanted to come by and apologize for my father's behavior today.
during the polygraph.
you don't have to apologize for him.
he has a right to feel any way that he wants.
it wasn't just Sara, Ollie.
what do you mean?
after Sara died, my father threw himself into his work.
I think that's part of the reason I'm an attorney.
he ran to the law and I followed.
but my mother couldn't.
so she left him.
left us.
look, I'm not trying to tell you this to make you feel bad, or worse.
I just... I really want you to understand him.
why don't you hate me?
you should.
I did.
for so long, I did, Ollie.
but after today, I realized that...
I was so focused on what happened to my family that I didn't even stop and wonder what could have happened to you.
I didn't know about the torture, or your scars.
what happened to you on that island was far more than you deserved.
and I was wrong that I didn't ask you before, but I'm asking you now.
I need to know. I need to see.
are you sure?
Yes.
how did you survive this?
there were times when I wanted to die.
in the end... There was something I wanted more.
no. Laurel, you don't have to go.
amazing. You have resolve I didn't credit you for.
or perhaps he truly doesn't know anything.
we should put him out of his misery.
it's an M249 machine gun.
Gas-powered, air-cooled, fires up to 800 rounds per minute.
we need to move, now!
I'm not accustomed to being summoned to the office in the middle of the night.
well, what was it that was so important that I had to race down here?
I found the "Queen's Gambit," Moira.
I know you secretly had the boat salvaged.
I wanted to move it to a more secure location before confronting you about it.
in fact, I sent Josiah Hudson to the warehouse for precisely that purpose.
but he died mysteriously in a car accident.
I hope you now have a better understanding of why it is I've been so distant of late.
it's very disconcerting to discover that the person with whom you share your home, your bed and your heart has been lying to you so convincingly, and I would be a fool not to consider all the things that you have told me were lies.
Walter, you're my husband, I... - Yes, I am.
Walter, please.
you've got to stop looking into this, it's not safe.
you'll be... you'll be upsetting people, people with influence.
you are very far out of your depth.
man in the hood, one, gangbangers, zero.
hang on. Yeah?
Mr. Queen, if you're entertaining guests upstairs, should I have some drinks sent up?
no. It's just me up here and I'm on my way back down.
good job. Now get back here.
how did you know I was in trouble?
because when the guy was fighting you, - he broke the ankle monitor. - Are you all right?!
I'm fine. Mom. I promise. - Oliver...
this is on you. By accusing my son publicly, you've made him a target.
do you have any idea who attacked Oliver?
we haven't identified him.
though it must be someone with a grudge against the Hood, obviously.
what are you doing?
I got a call from my lieutenant.
an arms dealer was attacked across town tonight.
by the vigilante. Multiple witnesses put him there.
in light of that, all charges against your son are being dropped.
I'm truly sorry for what's happened to your family, Quentin.
but would you kindly get the hell out of my house?
Mr. Lance... Thank you.
did we have an appointment?
no, but I decided to screw propriety after you tried to have my son killed.
I'm sure you understand,
I was justified in suspecting your son of being the vigilante targeting our associates.
I had to take steps.
and now that you know your steps were taken in error, that Oliver is not your enemy.
I offer my sincerest apologies.
I know you found out I had the yacht salvaged, just as I know you had Josiah Hudson killed.
well, accidents tend to befall people who are too curious.
I've been the good soldier.
I've done everything you asked.
but if any member of my family so much as gets a paper cut,
I will burn your entire world to ashes.
I tell you, island dangerous, but you not tell them where to find me.
you stronger than I thought. Take it.
I lead them off, you stay.
remember, everything breathe.
you breathe, you survive here longer.
No! I'm coming with you!
rough party.
my father told me what happened.
are you ok?
Yeah, I'm fine.
these are your polygraph results.
my father asked you if you'd ever been to Iron Heights.
it's the prison where the vigilante saved me last week.
it's also where you and I went on our eighth grade field trip.
when you said that you had never been there,
I thought maybe you were just nervous, or that you'd forgotten.
but then I looked at your results, and there is a slight flutter in your answer to that question.
and if you lied on one, you could have lied on others.
what happened to me being too selfish to be a masked crusader?
Oliver! I saw your scars.
do you want to know why I don't talk about what happened to me there?
because if people knew; If you knew... You'd see me differently.
and not as some... Vigilante guy.
as damaged.
I don't sleep.
I barely eat.
I can barely sign my name, let alone aim a bow and arrow.
after last night... Clearly we're still attracted to one another.
nothing can ever happen between us.
I know.
so you lied to her.
or maybe you just gave her a version of the truth.
I told her what she needed to hear, Diggle. She was too close.
sad thing is, I think you actually believe that.
I think things didn't go down exactly how you planned.
you didn't count on so many people having questions, doubting you.
you didn't think about what happens when you lie.
thank you. - Walter.
especially when you lie to the ones you love the most.
what is this?
business trip.
I decided it's long overdue for me to inspect our holdings in Melbourne.
and how long will you be?
I don't know.
when you were stuck on that island plotting your grand plan to save the city,
I don't think you stopped to consider the effect it would have on the people in your life.
let's go.
you're ok. No, no, no.
or how it might hurt them.
you're wrong.
I think about it all the time.
and just to be clear, not being able to tell my family the truth...
it doesn't hurt anyone worse than it hurts me.
where are you going?
Mueller still has to sell those guns and I have to stop him.
Oliver... - He had his chance.
28 crates, four guns in each crate,$250, 000 cash.
take it or leave it.
that's the deal.
Leo Mueller, you have failed this city.
my name is Oliver Queen.
for 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal... survive.
Oliver Queen is alive.
now I will fulfill my father's dying wish...
to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city.
to do this, I must become someone else.
I must become something else.
I'd like you to work with me on the Vigilante investigation.
thank you, sir!
it's just beginning. In six months, the organization's vision of what this city should be will be complete.
thousands of innocent people will be dead and you'll feel nothing.
that's not true.
I'll feel a sense of accomplishment.
so... How can we be of assistance?
Malcolm Merlyn. I want you to kill him for me.
these black arrows aren't consistent with his M. O.
something doesn't add up.
what do you mean, the chopper's about to touch down?
the flight log doesn't have them due for another 20 minutes!
then lock down the heliport!
I've just landed in Starling City.
we agreed... half on arrival, the other half when the job is done.
a
gracias. Don't worry. The man's as good as...
you have failed this city.
you've built quite a reputation.
and you should have stayed overseas.
I thought about it, but then I remembered... I've got a reputation, too.
now the trick is to keep your weight evenly distributed.
I thought the trick was to avoid getting into fights.
besides, if you're going to be working with us,
I'll sleep a lot easier knowing that you can handle yourself... At least a little bit.
how'd it go?
badly for him. - Who's him?
an assassin for hire with an affinity for knives.
his name was Guillermo Barrera. - Was?
so we can't ask him about his intended target?
no.
which is why I need you to hack his phone.
Barrera's world class.
he kills high profile targets.
and whatever job he was hired for isn't finished.
we need to figure out who he was here to kill, and fast.
they are probably still in danger.
OK? - Yeah.
I have to meet McKenna.
good thing she didn't meet you at the heliport.
may not be a good idea to fall for the cop that's hunting you down.
well, it's slim pickings for us vigilantes.
four.
well, I'm more of a runner.
why the sudden desire to work out?
what else is there to do?
well, we can try to think of another way off the island.
there is no other way.
if there was, I would have found it.
we can't just sit here and wait for Fyers to come and kill us.
I did have one idea.
if you go into the forest and gather as much bamboo as you can find...
yeah?
we could build ourselves a boat, like they did on "Gilligan's Island.
that's broken.
it got busted during the crash.
did you try to get it to work?
I'm better at pulling things apart.
my father was a pilot and he used to do his own maintenance.
so you're hoping aircraft maintenance is genetic?
no, I used to help him and I liked it.
then I got pretty good at it.
so maybe I can make the radio work.
you should be training for the inevitable fight that's looming.
I think I have a better chance of making the radio work.
sorry I'm late.
no, I am. I just got caught up at the office.
me, too.
you look nice.
we should go inside.
we should.
we don't seem to be going inside.
welcome.
happy Birthday, buddy. - Thank you.
Oh, this feels like a Chateauneuf de Pape.
it's going to taste like one, too.
you are a true friend. Thank you.
Tommy, you remember McKenna Hall.
from back in the day. - And back again.
Laurel, this is... - McKenna Hall.
we know each other from the court house.
how are you, counselor?
I'm well, Detective.
I'm going to go crack this open. - Come in.
such a nice apartment. So much space.
Oh, this is adorable.
how old are you here?
that's actually my sister Sarah.
Oh, I am so sorry.
no, no, it's ok.
I don't know why my father bought her that canary.
that thing chirped night and day. Drove us all nuts.
a toast.
to the first birthday that I have enjoyed in a long time.
I got my best friend back.
and... I have finally figured out why poets have been in business for the last few thousand years.
happy Birthday, baby. - Thank you.
Cheers. Cheers.
I think that's the food. - Oh, ok.
Oh, thank God, she didn't cook.
Amen.
Mr. Merlyn.
Laurel. Can I come in?
Mr. Merlyn.
I've been trying to get in touch with you.
what are you doing here, Dad?
happy Birthday, Tommy.
just give us a second.
of course.
we're about to eat. - I can't stay.
well, that works out because you weren't invited.
I'm being honored by the Starling City Municipal Group.
they're bestowing me with their annual Humanitarian Award.
what, they ran out of actual humans to give it to?
I would like you to be there, if you could.
I am 100% certain that I'll be busy.
you might not believe this, but all I ever wanted for you was happiness.
if it will allay this tension between us, I'll turn the switch back on.
save your money, Dad.
I don't need it anymore.
I'd still like you to come to the event.
it would mean a lot to me.
you know what, Dad?
sometimes the people that you want there the most... Aren't.
you taught me that.
multiple times.
Hello, Lawton.
I see your edge has dulled.
Oh, I knew you were there.
I just didn't care if you killed me.
what do you want?
my organization has been contracted to eliminate a certain high profile individual.
a very well-guarded target.
well, forget it.
look, I'm retired.
to drink and smoke your life away?
we all got to die some time.
I need someone to die at the right time.
and no one does it better than you.
my vision... ain't exactly what it used to be.
no.
it's going to be better.
so... Who needs two bullets in the chest?
is it happening?
Yes.
the Humanitarian Award ceremony.
isn't that a little public?
no one will expect it.
I have very welcome news to share with all of you.
thanks to Queen Consolidated's Applied Sciences Division and their recent acquisition of Unidac Industries, the Undertaking which we set for ourselves is only months from fruition.
there's hope on the horizon for everyone in starling.
we won't fail this city.
and I think I speak for everyone here when I say we're all with you, Malcolm.
jeez, this is one paranoid assassin.
Barerra's got cobalt-level encryption on his phone.
it's not going to be easy to break.
but codebreaker is my middle name. Actually, it's Megan...
Felicity, can you get anything off of it?
just the last number he dialed.
which was? - A restaurant in China town.
a Jade Dragon. I guess even hired killers enjoy the city's best chow mien.
Yeah, Jade Dragon is a front for the Chinese mafia.
call the restaurant, make a reservation for two for tonight.
you need to decrypt that phone.
I'm kind of in the mood for Chinese now.
that is...that is one big fried fish.
I was told this was the most authentic Szechwan in town.
whatever. I wanted to make sure that your birthday celebration got its due celebration.
it was a little bit, um, tense last night.
well, trust my dad to run all the smiles out of the room.
he did come by, and it seemed like he was trying to act a little bit dad-like.
Dad-like, that sums up my father perfectly.
I know the two of you have never been close, but it couldn't have been easy for him after your mom was killed.
Yeah, I guess he forgot that there were two of us in that club.
I'm not defending him, Tommy.
it's... With everything I've been through, people that I've lost...
I know how hard it can be.
you probably don't remember this.
we were eight.
but after her funeral, he left for like two years.
and when he did come back, he was... he was so frickin' cold.
we barely spoke.
and that's why I spent so much time at your house.
from the outside, it always looked like I had a father.
he paid my bills, he lived in the house, he bailed me out.
but your dad took me to my first hockey game.
your dad taught me how to fly fish.
your dad took us to our first R-rated movie.
but he wasn't perfect.
my dad made mistakes.
and... We haven't talked about this.
but I have a lot of anger towards him.
but still, I would give anything to have him back, because...
at the end of the day, your dad is... Your dad.
I meant what I said last night.
I'm... really glad that you're back.
I got to hit the restroom.
check, please.
I hope you like barbecue.
well, don't fall over yourself thanking me for spending six hours up a tree so you can eat.
what?
great. I'll eat later.
you've been on that for days. Give it a rest.
it's because I can do this.
sure, kid. When pigs fly.
you're kidding me.
can you clean this up?
I don't know. I don't know how I got this far!
continue approach. Big jet 365.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
this is wedgetail 325.
pilot and passenger down.
runway 2-7 right, wind, 2-7-0 degrees, 10 knots.
I repeat...pilot and passenger down on the island of Lian Yu.
request immediate rescue.
cleared to land, runway 2-7 right.
big jet 365.
they can't hear us, and we can't call out.
we're still trapped.
the Triad have hired a contract killer.
yeah? You mean the one you put in the morgue?
congratulations, you're the talk of the station again.
they hired one, they're going to hire another, Detective.
who's your target?
I'm trying to find out but I'm hitting dead ends.
I need you to put your people on it.
my people don't work for you.
and come to think of it, neither do I.
it's not about you and me, Detective.
it's about saving a life.
call me back when you got a name.
Yes, sir?
you and me. We're going to catch that Vigilante.
there are five exit routes from the main floor that need to be cut off.
once the fire alarm goes off, we'll have less than 30 seconds to disable Merlyn's private security and force him outside with the others.
once he's outside... The rest will be up to Mr. Lawton.
Roger that.
you look handsome!
I try not to. It just keeps happening.
what's the occasion?
I decided to go to my dad's thing.
Really?
are you sure?
Oh, mostly.
did you want me to go with you?
no, no, no, I know you have work to do.
I promise I will be fine.
n o
you look beautiful.
thank you.
if you're free, maybe after the ceremony, we could have dinner and talk like we used to.
I'd like that.
that's my cue.
I've been trying to avoid him all evening.
if we didn't show, it'd look suspicious.
how can you talk to him that way?
as if nothing's about to happen?
I've been living this life for five years.
five more minutes won't matter.
good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
now tonight's honoree needs very little introduction.
it's neither his wealth nor his name that we celebrate here tonight.
but it is his efforts in making Starling City a better and safer place to live.
so please help me welcome Starling City's humanitarian of the year, Mr. Malcolm Merlyn.
and so that's a stage, right.
most nights we'll have a band.
somebody cool. Is Fallout Boy still cool?
they broke up.
and never.
so somebody else will pick the bands.
something bothering you?
don't say no,'cause you're a terrible liar.
Really?
I thought I was getting better at it.
what's wrong?
there's a lot of stuff going on in my life.
work.
friends.
and I'm having a... difficult time figuring out how to fit it all in.
I've been struggling with some of those thoughts, as well.
do you have any good ideas?
I think we just have to be really honest about what's going on in our lives.
think you can do that?
come on.
I'm in! Yes!
Yes! Yes, way to go, Felicity Smoak.
you don't happen to speak Spanish, do you?
Arabic.
Oh, my God.
you know I'm there for you.
excuse me, Mr. Queen.
the I. T. department has that item that you requested.
one sec. - Ok.
you find the target?
Oliver, the target is Tommy's father.
at the awards ceremony?
Tommy's there.
um, McKenna, Mr. Diggle is going to take you home.
I have some unexpected business.
it's ok.
target is Malcolm Merlyn.
establish a perimeter but keep your distance.
I don't want the police caught in the crossfire.
the true humanitarian in the Merlyn family was my wife Rebecca.
many of you here knew her.
she tirelessly devoted herself to helping those less fortunate in the glades.
I like to think that if the men who murdered her knew her;
knew the work that she did, knew the person that she was...
he would have helped her to her car, made sure she was safe, instead of stealing her purse and shooting her.
the truth is, I haven't done enough for this city.
my city.
I failed it.
but I promise you... I am not finished yet.
I promise you that this city will be better for all of us.
and on that day, I will look at this beautiful award and feel that I have earned it.
I thank you.
Merlyn's not taking the bait. Change of plans.
I don't like improvisation.
drive him upstairs to his penthouse office.
I need to switch vantage points.
come with me.
there's an exit on the second floor.
I wasn't leaving until I knew you were safe.
go somewhere safe. I'll hold them off.
go now! - Come on!
where are we going? - Up.
who are those guys? - I don't know.
they're trying to kill you!
seems that way.
and we're going up, without any of your bodyguards?
dad! We need to get out of here.
Tommy, take a deep breath and trust me.
upstairs in my office is a panic room.
we get there, we seal it off.
Merlyn's headed to the penthouse.
why do you want Malcolm Merlyn dead?
I'll settle for you.
wait!
go! - You killed him!
surely as he would have killed you.
move, move, move!
electromagnetic locks.
what if they cut the power?
this floor is on an entire separate grid.
the glass?
lexan. Bulletproof. It's over.
how did you know how to do that?
what?
fight.
kill.
dad?
Freeze! SCPD.
put the bow down.
Tommy, you ok?
dad!
dad?!
turn around slowly.
dad.
I'm sorry.
I'm ok.
I'm ok.
damn it.
you're bleeding. You're bleeding.
I'll be fine, Tom.
no, no, no, Dad!
No!
stay back.
I'm not here to hurt you or your father.
I said stay back.
curare.
don't come any closer.
your father's been poisoned.
an assassin named Floyd Lawton laces his bullets with curare.
I've dealt with this before.
we need to dilute the poison in his bloodstream.
I said stay the hell back!
in three minutes he's paralyzed.
in four minutes, he suffocates.
if you don't let me help you now, he's dead before anybody gets here!
help. How?
fresh blood buys him time to get to the hospital.
a blood transfusion?
that's insane!
it's the only way.
he needs your blood.
you're out of time.
you need to make a decision right now.
why should I trust you?!
because you always have.
OK. Ready?
do it.
hold his arm.
come on, come on, come on.
you're the Vigilante.
Why?
later.
he's still going to need medical attention to fully clean out his system, you understand?
OK.
thank you.
I'm right here, Dad.
what did the Hood say to you?
he didn't say anything.
you let a homicidal maniac talk you into a homemade blood transfusion instead of calling the paramedics?
my father's life was at stake.
so first the Hood rescues you and Queen from those kidnappers, now he saves your old man.
but he's taking down every other one percenter out there.
is this guy a friend of yours, Merlyn?
I don't know who the hell he is.
if they can't hear us, then what's the point?
wait!
you still might have done us some good.
0500 hours from my mark.
final deployment is five by five.
that's Fyers!
I'm tuned into the soldier's frequency.
Scylla is in route. ETA 0600 hours.
at the southwest bay.
I'll call you when Scylla is in my possession.
Fyers out.
who was Fyers talking to?
I don't know.
sounds like someone off this island, maybe his benefactor.
more importantly, who or what is Scylla?
the Scylla and Charibdis.
it's "The Odyssey," from one of the four nightmare chapters.
Scylla was a monster.
I want to meet this monster.
am I going alone?
so how's it feel to save a one percenter?
looks like Malcolm Meryln's going to be ok.
they took him to Starling General.
good thing he was wearing a bulletproof vest.
he's not in the hospital because he was shot.
he was poisoned by curare.
Lawton's alive.
I'm sorry, John.
this Lawton kick his dog or something?
no.
he killed his brother.
what?
what is it?
you were right.
Scylla is a monster.
a Russian-made S300 anti-aircraft missile launcher.
it can simultaneously track up to a hundred targets while engaging with at least a dozen.
I mean, from here, they could shoot down a commercial airliner, or start a war.
Hey, you're here.
walk with me.
I heard you were there, are you ok?
I'm fine. Fine.
listen, McKenna, I'm... I'm really sorry that I had to run out on you like that.
don't worry. Five more minutes, and I would have had to run out on you.
our lives are complicated.
but I'm willing to figure us out.
if you are.
willing and able.
Hey. Hey, Dad.
take it easy.
you were shot.
the bullet was laced with poison.
I should be dead.
I gave you a blood transfusion.
actually it was... the Vigilante's idea.
he saved you.
he did?
I was worried I was going to lose you.
I'm not going anywhere.
you said that after mom died.
but you left.
I wasn't a very good father to you after your mother passed away.
I was so lost.
you never told me where you went.
I found myself in a place called Nanda Parbat.
I met a man there.
he helped me make sense of things.
he helped me to find a purpose for my life;
to make this city a better place for everyone.
especially for you.
how are you going to do that?
could I talk to Moira for a minute?
thank God you're all right.
we have a traitor in our midst.
I want you to find out who.
he just made his last mistake.
my dad's going to be ok, thanks to you.
it's thanks to you.
no one's asked you what happened to you out on that island.
you said "a lot." That doesn't quite cover it. - Tommy...
I saw you kill those guys who kidnapped us when you first got back, didn't I?
I... I know you have a lot of questions.
Yeah.
Yeah, but for now, just the one.
were you ever going to tell me?
no.
Tommy, I just saw it all on the news.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Bye.
Hello, Laurel.
mom?
what are you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
about what?
I know I've made mistakes.
Yeah.
Yes, you have.
look, I have to go.
why don't you send me an email or a postcard some time?
I have something important I need to discuss with you.
what could be so important after all this time?
it's about Sarah.
what about her?
I think she may be alive.
my name is Oliver Queen.
for 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal... survive.
Oliver Queen is alive.
now I will fulfill my father's dying wish...
to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city.
to do this, I must become someone else.
I must become something else.
mom? - What are you doing here?
I believe Sarah's still alive.
you don't actually have any proof.
I have proof. Doesn't it look just like Sarah?
I did manage to find one thing.
I want to get out.
Malcolm Merlyn. I want you to kill him for me.
we have a traitor in our midst.
he just made his last mistake.
lawyers for John Nickels spoke to the press today.
John Nickel is one of the wealthiest real estate developers in Starling City.
he's also one of the dirtiest.
that building that burnt down last night?
wiring was not up to code. - Maybe he didn't know that.
Yeah, he's a real man of the people.
not for long.
the D. A. ignores this, and the police can't do anything because all these slums are in the Glades. So tonight, Felicity, we cross Mr. Nickel's name off the list.
you ok with that?
100 percent.
he was just gone?
No! Not gone. Taken.
looks like Nickel was on somebody else's list, too.
after the fire last night, it's not entirely surprising.
Felicity, I need you to get me everything that you can on Nickel.
focus on his tenants, and anyone who might have filed a formal complaint against him, or...
people that lost something in the fire.
well, it's going to be some list. I mean, slum lords aren't generally known for their popularity. Plus...
what?
nothing, it's just... you went over there to be all, "grrr, stop being bad or I'll arrow you,
and now you want to rescue him.
I don't like the idea that somebody dangerous is out there.
somebody else.
because typically... They don't show my level of restraint.
so you're going to cross Nickel off anyway?
no.
I'm finding somebody else who needs a talking to.
you're going out there again, Oliver?
why don't you go home and be with your family, man?
that's when the work is done, Diggle.
OK, then I'll take you out to dinner.
I'm not hungry.
I'm not asking.
simple exchange.
you get us a way off the island, and we'll give you the circuit board so that your missile launcher isn't just furniture.
I can get you a boat.
but I need time.
you got an hour, Fyers, and then you're never... what?!
we understand it might take you longer than an hour to get a boat.
what we mean is you need to move with some dispatch.
Ah, Wilson, still in command there, eh?
I thought your little pet had staged a coup d'etat.
just get us the damn boat.
now you want to stop?
well, we don't all have butlers.
you know, some of us actually have to answer our own doors.
Oh, the horror.
you look familiar.
did I see you on TV or something?
probably. I'm Thea Queen.
Yeah, right.
did you get it?
tomorrow night.
Joe wants us there at 11 p. m.
he said to be on time, Harper.
what's happening tomorrow at 11: 00?
you know, I'm actually kind of focused on what's happening right now.
Oh, ok. Yeah.
no, no, Thea, don't!
why do you have a gun?
because I'm no good with knives.
look, it's just a liquor store.
the guy's a creep. Trust me, he deserves it.
look, if it'll make you feel any better... I won't be armed.
but of course, the owner won't know that, but...
I got you a job at my brother's club. You have choices. You don't have to be a criminal!
I'm not talking about phone bills.
I owe people.
people with much bigger guns than this.
look, here in the Glades, this is pretty much the only solution.
no, lots of people in the Glades live honest lives.
obviously not you.
you're just a waste.
no, Thea. Thea!
I'm going to make sure you get home ok.
don't bother.
Hey, honey.
there you go.
um, what's all this?
well, you asked me to look into your mother's leads on Sarah, so I made some calls.
it looks like you did a lot more than that.
well, yeah, but you're the one who said we should do this, Laurel, so, you know, if there's even a chance that your sister is...
Yeah, but... - thank you.
Hi, sweetheart, I'm sorry about the mess.
Quentin, I just got off the phone with the consulate in Phuket.
the secretary there's going to run Sarah's photo against their database, see if there's a match.
that's good work.
what?
well, I guess I just thought deep down that you were going to help mom... accept things.
things you and I accepted.
Yeah, but... You got to admit.
this girl, she looks a lot like Sarah.
Sarah had that same cap. The Starling City Rockets.
your dad bought it for her, remember?
Yeah, I remember.
stranger things have happened.
Yeah. I can see that.
hungrier than I thought.
are you waiting for me to finish before giving me the lecture?
Oliver, you've been spending a lot of time under that hood the last couple weeks.
keeps my ears warm.
and you made this decision to, um, avoid entanglements?
for their protection.
the people who get close to me get hurt.
what's the problem?
do you think I'm losing my grip?
no, it's just the opposite, really. You seem calm.
scary calm.
I get that things didn't end well with Helena, with McKenna...
with Laurel. With Sarah.
the list goes on. - Yeah. But what do you do?
you hood up, you go home, you repeat. It's not much of a life.
well, the life that I'm leading for myself right now doesn't leave much room for an actual life.
and I don't need one.
that's a pretty bleak future you plan on spending...with no one.
I'm used to isolation.
and that is exactly what worries me.
you've been home for 8 months, Oliver, but I don't think you left that island yet.
what the hell is going on?
found Nickel. Click the link I just sent you.
this came up on every screen with an I. P. address originating from the Glades.
if you make the Glades your home, you know who this man is.
he owns your tenements.
manages your slums.
provides the leaking roofs over your head.
the mold in your pipes and asbestos in your walls.
basically, he makes money off our suffering.
but the police aren't interested in helping us.
they may have let us down, but I won't.
John, I want to give you the chance to state your case.
why shouldn't you be punished?
I knew there was bad stuff in my buildings.
track him, Felicity. - I'm looking.
OK, yes, I made a little profit!
at least they had a place to live.
without me, people like that would end up on the street.
people like that.
that's all we are to guys like this.
don't.
I find you... Guilty.
there are plenty more people who need to answer for their crimes against us.
so... Who's next?
anything new?
this guy's definitely got more than a subscription to "Wired.
his website's protected by some very serious encryption.
well, use that air magnet thing, you said that it could trace...
Oliver! No offense. Do I tell you how to sharpen your arrows?
spoke to my friend at the NSA.
the website code matches a cyber crusader who's been on their radar.
he hacks into fringe sites under the user name "The Savior.
NSA believes he's a former resident of the Glades.
former? - Yeah, well, a year ago, he hacked himself right off the radar.
he erased all traces of his existence.
so what happened a year ago?
we're back.
I have with me assistant district attorney Gavin Carnahan.
now, DAs are supposed to go after bad guys.
but this one can't even be bothered to bring them to trial.
like the ones who killed my wife in a bodega.
Felicity... - I'm on it.
they said there wasn't enough evidence.
you think the evidence would have turned up if she'd been killed in one of Starling City's nicer neighborhoods?
Emma Falk. Grieving husband is Joseph Falk. What do we have on him?
not much. 42, former city worker.
department of transportation, computer technician, left his job when she was killed. One year ago today.
no current phone, no current address.
Gavin, you're a lawyer. You're used to making a case.
so go ahead.
I'm going to give you ten minutes to deliver the closing argument of your life.
come on. - I'm trying to get a lock on his wireless signal.
10 minutes to convince me not to blow you away.
what did Malcolm want with you last night?
a target for reprisal.
he wants justice, and he's not going to stop until he gets it.
besides, this is good.
I think your definition of good requires an adjustment.
no, he came to me. Which means he doesn't know that we're responsible for the attempt on his life.
yet.
what are the chances of Malcolm discovering who paid the triad to assassinate him?
I was very discreet.
I wired the money through a shell corporation I own, from an offshore account.
offshore? Good. That's good.
I'm sending Amanda to London for a few weeks, just as a precaution.
perhaps you should do the same for your family.
there's nothing I wouldn't do to protect my children, Frank.
Hey, can I talk to you about something?
almost woman to woman.
I'm really busy right now.
OK.
sorry.
what's up?
I could use some advice.
I'm sort of dating this guy who would definitely be described as a bad boy.
and I figured, as someone who's dated like a gajillion of them...
I haven't dated a gajillion.
all right, guilty as charged.
you want my advice? Run.
as fast as you possibly can.
Yeah. See, that was my first instinct, too, but...
Laurel? The Chinese embassy's on line two.
I'm transferring him over.
chinese embassy?
it's just this case that I'm working on.
but we are definitely continuing this conversation later.
thank you so much for getting back to me.
I'm trying to track down a woman in the photo that I emailed you.
you did.
Really?
and you're sure that she's in the states now?
do you happen to have an address on her?
I got him! - Shut it down.
can't. He has a firewall protecting his wireless signal.
but he's working off an IPX located at 23rd and Mira.
you want to hood up? - The middle of the day!
look! Listen. Listen to me. Ok.
I have 53 cases on my desk right now.
I don't always have time to take on every case!
how's Carnahan?
not making a very persuasive argument.
I'm almost there.
see anything? - I'm only on the first floor.
just six more to go.
there aren't resources. I tried.
Oh, my God! I'm sorry! - Oliver, hurry.
can't find him!
he's not here, Felicity! - What?!
I searched every office on every floor!
he's not here. Is this the right place?
are you sure? - Yeah, I...
Oh, crap. - What?
how is this possible?! This can't happen! He's...
talk to me! - Wait.
he moved. Just north of you. Ocean and Grand.
on my way!
I took on cases that were...that I thought that I could...
win. - Yes.
I'm sorry.
Gavin Carnahan, I find you guilty of crimes against the Glades.
don't do this! Don't do this!
and I sentence you to death.
I'm at Ocean and Grand, Felicity. That's just a vacant lot.
how is this possible? This can't happen. He...
find the right address, now!
Oliver, it's over, Carnahan is dead.
Where's Diggle?
I asked him to leave me alone.
in my loud voice.
this wasn't your fault.
I was the one who was supposed to find Carnahan, and I was the one who sent you that bogus location.
I've never seen anybody die.
this is the thing with what we do.
sometimes we lose.
maybe it is better being alone.
I'm not seeing anyone currently, but...
if I were, I don't know how I'd tell him about today.
gentlemen. Welcome.
so happy we were able to reach an accord.
Oh, good. Small talk.
are we going to get on with this?
as you wish. Straight to business.
the circuit board. Where is it?
somewhere safe.
so get us to the boat and then we'll tell you where it is.
and of course you'll be honest about its location.
well, I wouldn't be.
but this one's got some strange hang up about principles and integrity.
I always imagined as much.
which is why I'd like to make a counter proposal.
men!
No!
No!
you will deliver back to me the circuit board, or I will kill Yao Fei's daughter.
so I wouldn't leave.
I can't imagine you want the death of an innocent young woman on your hands.
not with your... Principles.
I wanted to do some research on my own into the evidence that you gathered on Sarah.
so I called my friend from law school who works at the Chinese embassy, and...
the photo of the girl.
I found her.
I'm sorry. Can I... can I borrow your phone?
I promised my fianée that I'd call him before dinner. My phone's dead.
Jen, these are my parents.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you, too.
I just told Jen about this photograph that popped up in this case that I'm working on.
is that you in the picture?
Yeah. I spent six months on an island off the coast of China.
that was taken in a small fishing village called Zhengjiu.
it's Mandarin for... - Salvation.
are you all right, Mrs. Lance?
Yes, I... it's just, uh, you look like someone I used to know.
I was waiting for this.
waiting for what?
the whole "You can change, I can see the real you" speech.
look around, Thea.
this is home sweet home for me.
you either starve or you do things that mean you're lucky enough to make it to 21.
I can't accept that.
no. You can't accept me.
Roy Harper?
more on the story out of the Glades.
the kidnapper seems to have another victim and is broadcasting the feed to his website.
a warning to viewers, this is live footage, so we're not sure what we're about to see.
meet Roy Harper.
arrests for larceny and robbery, aggravated assault.
and yet you're out on the street.
another gangbanger in the Glades running free, like the ones who killed my wife.
I'm grew up in the Glades, too.
and it didn't turn me into a criminal.
I know that kid.
how? - Tommy!
Oh, God, no.
I didn't know where else to go.
you know him? - Roy, he's my friend.
and we were in a fight and some guy came out of nowhere and just attacked us!
he doesn't deserve to die!
I promise you, he's going to be ok.
you stay here with Tommy, all right?
Hello? - Moira, it's Malcolm.
I've learned a high ranking member of the Triad was just arrested.
well, I should have a word with him.
I already have. He's agreed to find out who hired his organization to assassinate me in return for a reduced prison sentence.
by tonight, we should know the name, or names, of the people who tried to kill me.
good.
what are you doing?
so it's not Sarah in the photo.
but she's still out there, Quentin.
and I'm going to find her.
look, I understand now that neither of you have the stomach to continue looking for her.
and that's fine.
I'm sorry I involved you both.
you know that I would cross to hell and back to bring her home, but I can't!
cause she's gone, Di.
no.
you got to let go of this now.
No! I can't!
I won't!
how did you know Sarah had her hat with her when she went on the boat?
you were so sure that the girl in the photo was Sarah.
not because she was American, but because of her hat.
her Starling City Rockets hat that dad bought her.
mom.
how did you know she took her hat with her on "the Queen's Gambit" with Oliver?
I saw her.
what do you mean?
I came home early that day, and I saw her.
I saw her put the hat in a bag.
she was packing.
you knew she was going with him?
I told her not to... I told her not to do this, not to you, Laurel.
but she said she was in love and she had to follow her heart, even if nobody else thought it was right.
just like I told her... Just like I told her I once did.
so... I let her go.
I killed her.
I... I killed my daughter.
I killed her.
I'm so sorry, Quentin.
I'm so sorry, Quentin.
I killed our baby.
anything?
I've been going through all the video we got, trying to see if there's anything that'll tell us where this guy is.
I got nothing, except a sound.
buried in the ambient noise. Almost rhythmic.
here, I've isolated it.
what is that?
sounds like a car driving over lane markers.
it's bigger than a car.
bigger than a car. What, a bus? - Uh... wait, I know this.
I know it.
come on! Guys!
Felicity, show me a map. Sights of the abductions on where we've seen the signal so far.
right there, right there.
23rd and Mira.
Locksley and Adams.
wells street down by CNRI.
those are all subway stops! - Starling City doesn't have a subway.
no, but they used to. When I was a kid, my dad used to take me down to the Rockets game.
by subway. For 14 minutes, I'd lean against the window, feeling the rhythm of the train moving.
that's how he did it.
he was at 23rd and Mira, but he was underground.
he used to work for the department of transportation, so that's why he knows all the old subway stops.
that's why I couldn't trace the signal.
he was moving. He was in a subway car.
where is he now?
he's on the old cross town line.
if he continues on this route, he'll be at the Spring Street stop in 15 minutes.
let the girl go.
no deal?
very well. Kill her.
No!
that was unexpected.
fire!
come on! Come on!
get her to safety! Now!
I'll only slow you down. Go!
just go! You've got to go!
go! Go!
it's happening. - I'll give you 10 minutes to state your case, Roy.
so tell us.
why do you get to live?
I shouldn't.
just do it.
kill me.
just go on! Kill me!
you really don't care if you live or die?
no one's going to miss me.
I'm just a waste.
then we agree on something.
this world would be better off without you in it.
we seem to have lost the feed.
we will stay on this story and keep you up to date on any developments.
let the kid go.
you kill this kid, you'll never get an opportunity to change!
you can give him a second chance.
we're the only ones who can save this city.
we can't stop now.
we're not the same!
you've killed people for this city, so have I.
what's the difference between you and me?
Emma never got her second chance.
you have no idea how lonely it is.
I understand being alone.
but it doesn't give you the right to kill people in cold blood.
he deserves it.
just like the gangbangers who gunned her down, he's no different than them.
and now I get to gun him down.
don't do it!
got to get going to the airport.
that red eye to Central City.
I should be home in a flash.
mom.
call me some time.
I'd really like that.
you would?
of course I would.
you're my mother.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
a
I thought you were going to die.
that makes two of us.
I probably look like a mess.
I'm going to go to the bathroom and freshen way, way up.
OK.
I heard Thea's friend was ok.
Yeah. That worked out ok.
this Roy... is more than just a friend, isn't he?
bad boys.
hook you every time.
Oh, I think, uh, Tommy actually went home for the night.
you all right?
you seem like you're something other than all right.
my mom, she showed up in town this week and she's been...
what?
she had this crazy idea that Sarah was still alive.
she was so sure of it that she kind of had me believing it, also.
but Sarah's gone.
Yeah.
I can't believe she sucked me in like that.
you miss her. - I miss them both.
thanks for listening.
of course.
want to have dinner, or... coffee, I don't know.
Why?
I don't want to be on an island anymore.
good night. - Good night.
circuit board's gone.
damn. Fyers played us.
while he was screwing us around, his men were combing the woods for it.
now his missile launcher is fully operational.
and he was never going to let us off the island, I get it!
of course he wasn't going to help you.
he couldn't chance you warning the mainland what he has planned.
she speaks English. - Yeah, well, guess what.
neither one of us have any idea what his plans are.
I do.
thank you for coming, Frank.
meeting like this is dangerous, Moira.
particularly now. - Yes, I know.
Malcolm knows. - What?
I had no choice but to turn over what I've discovered.
the evidence of the wire transfer; the money that you paid the Triad to assassinate him.
the money I... Moira!
Mr. Merlyn thanks you for your loyalty.
you've done well.
now Chen's family will share his fate.
chen betrayed us, but his daughter didn't.
tell Mr. Merlyn I want her to live.
Amanda nearly lost her life in the Glades, now she's lost her father.
I think she's suffered enough.
we must send a message.
we have.
very well. - Thank you...
Thea's friend is upstairs. - I saw.
you probably saw that they were very happy to see each other, if you know what I mean.
which you probably don't want to talk about, because she's your baby sister.
you ok?
I'm getting there.
thank you.
by the way.
if you ever need to tell someone about your day... You can tell me.
what's that?
felicity pulled it up. It's an old map of a decommissioned subway line.
runs underneath the low rent district of the city.
I've seen that map before.
it was right in front of our faces the entire time.
my father, the other archer, the undertaking, whatever the plan is.
it's all connected to the Glades.
my name is Oliver Queen. For 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal...
survive.
Oliver Queen is alive.
now I will fulfill my father's dying wish
to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city.
to do this, I must become someone else.
I must become something else.
rescuing your father and stopping Fyers is not going to be some walk in the park.
yao Fei! Ba!
how did you escape?
I didn't.
you told me to stay away from your family and I did, but your family isn't staying away from me, which means something must be done about it.
you're going home.
about my mother, and about her involvement in the Undertaking.
she's working with Malcolm Merlyn, and they're planning something terrible.
so, I was wondering
there's a late night happy hour at Stella's.
you know, the place across the street.
you mean the place that's always playing loud salsa music at all hours when I'm trying to work late?
that--that would be the one, yeah.
anyway, I was thinking that, um, maybe, you know, if you wanted to, we could perhaps grab a drink?
how about two?
Oh, my God!
please.
I did everything Mr. Merlyn required of me!
he knows, Dr. Markov, and he thanks you for your service.
open the door! Open the door!
Freeze!
No! Open the door!
get down on the floor!
I've been watching your mother for days now, Oliver, and nothing.
she goes to work, she comes home. Occasionally she goes out for dinner.
she seems to particularly like the salmon tartar at table salt.
I'm linked into her home and office phone.
nothing out of the ordinary.
no mention of Walter's abduction or the Undertaking.
just a few innocuous calls to Malcolm Merlyn.
why wouldn't she call him?
they're old friends.
we're all old friends.
are you ok?
my mom and my best friend's dad are involved in a conspiracy that may have dire consequences for the city.
and I'm pretty sure they murdered my father.
listen, all we know for sure is that Malcolm and your mother are planning something for the glades.
and that Walter and I were getting too close to it, that's why they had him kidnapped.
we have to find out what this Undertaking is.
I got to ask her.
well, no. The last time the Vigilante paid your mom a visit, you got shot, and I got to play doctor with you.
Ahh! My brain thinks of the worst way to say things.
this time it'll just be me asking.
friendly mother-son chat.
Laurel? What are you doing here? It's not even 7: 00 a. m.
that's just after closing time, right?
how's business?
well, it's busy.
busy. It was easier when Tommy was running things.
Tommy's a good guy. Yeah.
are you?
what do you mean?
last week, I told you that I wanted to get back with Tommy.
that I needed you to go to him and explain to him that you didn't still have feelings for me.
but instead, you told me that you did.
as I'm sure you can probably imagine, I haven't been able to think of much since.
I shouldn't have said that.
then why did you?
I didn't... have an agenda.
I didn't mean to make it more difficult for you to fix things with Tommy.
but what if you did?
after you disappeared with Sara， I was sorry I ever knew you.
but now, things have happened that I never thought would
you coming home.
my parents being in the same room.
and you.
what if I'm finally starting to see you for who you really are? No, Laurel, it's
and maybe Tommy was right.
maybe he and I weren't meant to be.
maybe I'm finally ready to admit that...
that I still have feelings for you, too.
nothing's changed.
my life hasn't changed.
I haven't changed.
I got to go.
Walter's coming home.
everything's exactly as you left it.
how are you feeling, Walter?
I'm on the mend, thank you, Oliver.
Oh, I'm so glad you're home.
that makes two of us.
all of us.
we've prepared a delicious brunch for you.
all your favorites.
Oh, yum, English food.
actually, I'm more tired from the drive than I expected.
so I think I'd like to lie down for a bit.
Yes, of course.
Walter doesn't really seem like himself.
he's gone through a lot.
it's just... going to take a little bit of time.
I'm really sick of us all having to go through a lot, you know?
six scientists and three security personnel are confirmed killed in the massacre.
among the dead, respected seismologist Brian Markov.
a spokesperson for Unidac Industries says a comment would be forthcoming.
mom, we need to talk.
Oh, uh, later, Oliver.
...co-workers, parents and families of all the victims to see how they're coping with their loss.
you! Save it.
we don't have the luxury of indulging in vendettas.
Ba! Shado.
you led Fyers right to us, you coward!
Fyers was about to fire bomb the entire forest just to eliminate you.
this way, you all have a chance.
well, pray I don't get the chance to repay your mercy.
how fitting.
everyone reunited for the end.
the end of what? What is all this for?
HKIA, this is Ferris Air flight 637 out of Paris, nonstop to Hong Kong.
we are steady on approach at 33, 000 feet and winds at 15 knots.
ETA, two hours, 15 minutes, over.
Ferris 637, this is hkia.
adjust course to 0. 6 degrees south.
11 minutes, over.
Roger, HKIA. Why the course change?
nothing to worry about, 637.
just looking to make sure you avoid a little turbulence.
Roger that. Adjusting course now.
they're altering course, sir. The plane will be in range of Lian Yu in 26 minutes.
good. Keep tracking it.
that's a commercial airliner, Fyers.
it's not like it can land here.
it won't be landing anywhere, Mr. Queen.
I'm going to destroy it.
arrows are black, not green.
copycat archer again.
psychopaths are color-coding themselves now.
that's helpful. Yeah, except we haven't seen the copycat in quite a while.
OK, last time he took hostages to draw out the Vigilante.
this time, he massacres a bunch of lab nerds?
I want a press lockdown, nobody hears about the other archer and we need to get a list of all Unidac employees and find out what they're working on here.
apparently it was a tight group.
anyone who knows anything about the project is dead.
and the copycat fried all their computers and burned their research.
whatever's going on here, someone doesn't want anyone to know about it.
where did you even get that camera?
come to think of it, where did you get this car?
I borrowed it.
illegally.
you know, when I imagine being in a car with you, this isn't exactly what I had in mind.
Yeah, well, you're the one who said you'd help me find the Vigilante.
I know, but it's been two weeks, and the closest we've come is snapping photos of the cop who hates the Hood just as much as you worship him.
I don't worship him.
I just need to find him.
you don't need to find him to be somebody.
besides, it's not like you're going to meet him any time soon.
just that the cops don't have a clue.
we don't know what they know.
OK, I officially do not like that look.
you still work at CNRI, right?
Hey, Mom.
Walter's upstairs resting.
I think he's... doing well, don't you?
who took him?
well, we don't know yet. But I'm going to make sure all the resources of Queen Consolidated are behind it.
that's the answer that you gave to reporters yesterday.
tell me the truth.
I don't know what you mean.
I think you do. A couple months ago,
something about our family being in danger.
but it was harder than you thought.
and now you're barely keeping your head above water.
please, Mom.
let me help you before you drown.
you need to stop asking these things. Do you understand?
I need you to stop.
I can't.
I need to know.
is that a power outage?
I don't know.
mom!
you have failed the city.
it doesn't make any sense!
why do you want to blow up a plane?
the Dow Jones dropped nearly 685 points.
can you imagine what would happen to China, were to be grounded indefinitely?
you want to destabilize China's economy?
it's not what I want, but rather my employer.
and that will decimate China's economy.
I said I need you alive, but I can kill everyone you care about.
help you with something?
Yes, um, I'm from CNRI and we're investigating claims of racial bias in SCPD arrests.
so I'm going to need a copy of each file 2011 to the present.
it's almost 9: 00 at night.
Yeah, well, tell that to Judge Crow.
he's the one who signed the court order.
wait here.
I don't know, it seems like a bit of a reach.
Yeah, which is what you do when you got nothin'.
cause all I know is the copycat, he torched every record down at Unidac.
and all we got are phone records.
a couple of calls? Did I say reach?
I misspoke. I meant leap.
did you find anything?
lots.
anything helpful? No, still looking.
what about you? You learn anything from the cops?
as a matter of fact...
I like the sound of that.
you know that copycat archer?
Yeah.
turns out he's connected to Merlyn Global somehow.
or, at least his victims are.
we're looking for the Hood, not some crazy wannabe.
please!
do not hurt my son.
tell me what the Undertaking is and I won't have to.
No! Tell me!
please!
leave my son alone!
what is Malcolm Merlyn planning?!
I can't tell you!
he'll kill me, he'll kill my family.
you should be more worried about what I'll do.
No!
Malcolm is planning to level the Glades!
he said so he could rebuild it, but...
how?
there's a device. What device?!
he says that it can cause an earthquake.
how is this possible?
I don't know.
it was invented by Unidac Industries.
Malcolm used my company's Applied Sciences to turn it into a weapon.
why would you get involved in something like this?
my husband...
he got involved without my knowing.
he was just trying to do some good.
he was lost. He...
his decisions left me vulnerable to Malcolm, and I had no choice.
I had to protect my family and my children.
this device... Where is it?
I don't know.
if you don't tell me, I can't stop Merlyn!
Oh, you can't stop him.
it's too late.
no, no, no, I told you everything!
No! Oh, sweet.
please, I know what you must be thinking, sweetheart, but I never intended any of this to happen.
I don't know anything anymore.
Oh, my God.
you said you were going to pull your punches!
I did. Let me get you an icepack for...
everything. I'm fine.
well, we know Queen Consolidated acquired them seven months ago.
that's when we met.
I need information about what I don't know.
that specializes in seismic infringement.
you're kidding.
what else does it say?
on what the media's calling
What?! So the other archer works for Merlyn?
he's tying up loose ends.
erasing all evidence this device exists so no one can trace the devastation back to him.
all right, so you're going to have a pointed conversation with Mr. Merlyn.
well, even if I take out Merlyn, the other archer is still out there.
he can set off the device. We need to find it.
then Merlyn can get his.
well, maybe there's another way to get Merlyn to tell us.
what do you have in mind?
hacking " is such an ugly word.
stop!
I'll do it.
I knew your good judgment could be counted on.
come along now.
we need to get you back into uniform.
it's Fyers. It's happening.
understood.
that was Fyers.
everything is proceeding to your plan.
it truly is very kind of you to come all the way out here.
who are you speaking to
how are you?
well. Thank you.
actually, you look a little bit out of sorts.
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
Malcolm stopped by to check up on his nemesis.
on the racquetball court.
I didn't get a chance to talk to Walter at the hospital. Like everyone,
Yes.
I'll let you get some rest.
thanks again. Yeah.
uh, I'll walk you out.
well, now the police are focused on the copycat archer instead of the Undertaking. As for our collateral damage,
I had to limit our exposure. I see.
you held him for nearly six months.
surely you had him questioned. He was.
and I assume that if Walter knew something you'd rather he didn't, agreement be damned,
I would be a widow again. Am I wrong?
rarely.
well, we discovered a few phone calls.
but naturally, they send down the one guy that's been working there 30 seconds and knows nothing.
I want them found as much as you do.
give me more to go on than some phone calls and I will help you in any way that I can.
thank you.
what are you doing here?
helping your father with an investigation.
call me if you need anything else.
thank you.
one second, sweetie.
you'll need a warrant.
no, we'll need a judge who owes me a favor.
you never did tell me what had you and Merlyn on the outs.
no, I didn't.
you don't have to tell me.
Oliver.
come on.
I know. I know. Say it.
you - you think I'm crazy.
I mean, Oliver, he cheated on me, he broke my heart, he led Sara to her death and you would probably rather drink acid than see me with him again.
dad...
I am sure you're disappointed in me.
since Queen's been back, he's...
different.
I'll deny ever having said that.
let's eat.
anything?
just for the record, I will pump my fist in the air and scream, "yes!" If I get in.
you know, you can just say this isn't working.
this isn't working.
all right, there has to be some other way we can find out where he's keeping this device.
unless I can waltz up to Merlyn's mainframe and plug in my tablet directly, there's no way of getting that location.
then we waltz.
excuse me?
you need direct access to the mainframe, so we get you direct access to the mainframe, and we figure out where the device is being kept.
Oliver...I did mention on the 25th floor?
it's only accessible through a restricted access elevator.
I know.
we're going to have to break in.
Hi. Oliver Queen.
I have an 11: 30 with Tommy Merlyn.
I have a super deluxe big Belly Buster for a Mr. Andrews. I think he's in security.
he a good tipper?
you can go on up, Mr. Queen.
you can wait a second.
new guy, you order food?
Yeah, I'm addicted to big belly burger.
never had it.
I'll split it with you.
keep the change.
hold that.
where you heading, sweetie?
19th floor.
too bad, I'm going to 13.
damn it!
Mr. Andrews got his lunch?
one belly buster with benzodiazepine. Hold the mayo.
sleep tight.
mainframe's on 25, guys. That's as close as I can get you.
come on.
don't look down.
too late.
I should mention, I'm afraid of heights, which I just learned.
Hey, Felicity. Hmm?
hold on to me tight.
I imagined you saying that under different circumstances.
very platonic... circumstances.
ready? Uh-huh.
you all right?
I'm fine.
Yeah, this is just my " about to hack " face.
I always... Oh, look like this right before I, you know, hack.
security patrol's on a ten minute cycle.
I'll have my meeting with Tommy and be back in nine, ok?
OK.
OK.
dig, you got eyes on her?
five by five.
OK.
sure beats the back of a bar.
I saw your name in my schedule,
I thought it must be a typo.
why so serious? Did someone decide that they didn't want you putting an arrow in them today?
I thought it was past time we talked.
about what?
me leaving the club, you being a serial killer?
we're not lacking for topics.
let's start with Laurel, since you're still in love with her.
so are you.
I can't be with her, Tommy.
you know why I can't.
so what?
I'm her consolation prize? I'll pass.
she's not anyone's...property.
laurel makes her own decisions.
and she chose you.
until you couldn't handle it.
lord knows I am guilty of a lot of things between us, but not you and her.
that's all I came to say.
what exactly do you do here?
I work closely with my father.
guys, you got trouble. What?!
Felicity's about to have some head of schedule company.
I'm not there yet on the download.
hold tight, I'm on my way.
Mr. Merlyn.
I must say, I'm surprised to see you here.
Tommy and I just had a little unfinished business.
Ahh. I know things have been challenging between you two, but I trust you're working things out.
Felicity! - Just a few more seconds.
Yes.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
there are some investors waiting for me back at the club.
I'm heading out to a meeting myself.
I'll walk you down to the lobby.
she's going to get made, Oliver.
Oliver, did you hear me?!
what? Just a few more seconds!
come on, come on, come on.
you don't have a few more seconds.
Yes! Wow, I really do do that.
damn it, Oliver, she's in trouble, where are you?
this is a restricted area.
let's see some I. D.
I. D? Um...
tell your mother I said hello.
I will.
got held up. Heading back upstairs.
what are you doing here?
I, uh, just saw Tommy.
Yeah, me, too.
I'm going to run back up, I don't want to be late.
Oh, I thought you just came down.
there you are!
thanks a lot, man, this one snuck past security.
one of Merlyn junior's bimbos.
she's pissed he never called her back.
copy that. I read the tabloids.
Yeah. Thanks again. Let's go, Barbie.
your new last name ain't going to be Merlyn.
but I love him! He's my man!
you're my knight in shining armor.
is that your friend Roy?
no, um... No?
Yeah, he gave me a ride.
Thea, what are you really doing here?
the truth, please.
the truth? Mm-hmm.
um...We're trying to find the Vigilante.
what?
Roy's been kind of obsessed with him since he saved his life at the subway.
and I overheard Detective Lance saying that the other archer was connected to Merlyn Global, so...
Hey! Roy.
we haven't met. I'm Thea's disapproving older brother.
Yeah, I know. Good to meet you.
don't mess around with the Hood.
he's a psychopath, he's dangerous, and anyone who gets near him winds up dead.
that will not be my sister. Do you hear me?
OK.
take her home...now.
what are you doing?
the Vigilante's not too fond of guys who sell Vertigo.
I know a guy who claims he still has a stash to sell.
maybe we could stake him out, hope the Hood shows up for him.
did you not hear what my brother said?
what does your brother know about him?
uh, for one thing, the Vigilante once saved his life, so if he's telling us to keep away, that should say something.
no offense, Thea, but your brother's kind of a wimp.
don't say that. Why not? It's true.
my brother survived five years alone on an island!
five years I thought I had lost him.
yeah? Well, I lost someone, too.
and they aren't coming back.
who?
it doesn't matter.
that is why I need to find him.
so he can teach me to be like him.
I'm not losing anyone else ever again.
I can't do this, Roy.
if you don't give this up, you're going to lose me.
better now than later.
Oh, good.
I was just coming to check on you to see if maybe you'd like some tea, or...
what is this?
please.
divorce is an extreme reaction.
well, considering the circumstances, I find it somewhat reserved.
or do you think I believe that my abduction on the night you told me that I was getting too close to your conspiracy was a coincidence.
you--you were in danger.
this arrangement, it saved your life.
well, that's ironic.
because it feels like you've destroyed it.
you know, I read about people in forced captivity.
some of them said it was a simple thought that got them through the isolation and fear
returning to their loved ones.
so I don't know really why I'm still alive, Moira, because I didn't have that.
Walter, please...
what do you think you can say to me to convince me that everything I knew, my whole life...
hasn't just evaporated?
where are you going?
come here.
detective?
What'd you find?
Merlyn Global's cyber security is off the charts.
firewalls, NSA-grade I. P.Sec protocols...
what's that, tech speak for " I struck out, boss.
Yeah, but I wasn't the only one.
somebody else tried hacking into Merlyn Global systems.
same pathways I used, same result.
you're saying that someone else was looking for Merlyn's connection to Unidac?
Yeah, someone good.
knew how to reverse engineer her footprints.
I almost didn't catch her. Her?
Yeah. She works at Queen Consolidated.
name's Felicity Smoak.
who the hell is Felicity Smoak?
in addition to the download, I also took the liberty of uploading a trojan to Merlyn's system.
figured it might come in handy.
that's smart. If Merlyn thinks he's been compromised, it'll help if we know first.
can you locate the seismic device?
I'm working on it.
but there's at least a teraflop of data to go through.
you all right?
my father, he told me that he failed the city.
asked me to right his wrongs, but I never knew what he meant until now.
it's the Undertaking.
I promised myself that when I crossed all these names off the list, I'd be done, but...
taking down these people, it doesn't honor him.
I was just treating the symptoms while the disease festered.
I stop the Undertaking...
I wipe out the disease.
what are you saying, Oliver? You would hang up the Hood?
Merlyn's plan is what I returned from the island to stop.
where are you going?
out.
Hi.
can we talk?
thank you.
what did you want to talk about?
wow, I thought this was going to be easier to say.
but now I'm standing here...
looking at you, and it's
just say what you have to say and go, ok?
ever since I've been back, we've been doing this dance.
we come together, and then I pull away.
something pulls me away.
but I think...
finally...
that something might be over.
what are you trying to say?
that...you know me better than anyone.
and that you...
are more important to me than anyone.
I just hope I didn't wait too long to say it.
you didn't.
you're right on time.
what is it?
felicity found the Markov device.
Merlyn's keeping it at a warehouse his company owns in the Glades.
good. Coordinate an attack.
you take the device, I'll take Merlyn.
got a location?
Yeah. According to Felicity's trojan, Merlyn's logged on to his computer from his office.
I'm on my way.
the uniform suits you, Yao Fei.
any time you're ready.
to the people of China and citizens of the world,
I make this statement voluntarily, taking responsibility for the shooting of Ferris Air flight 637
to protest the People's Republic of China's treatment of me;
for betraying and abandoning me to the island of Lian Yu.
consider this my righteous delivery of powerful vengeance.
thank you.
No! Ba!
Ba! Sir.
plane is within range.
very well.
I'll be in touch.
can I help you?
no...
I wasn't talking to you.
you have failed this city.
and how have I done that?
the Undertaking.
it ends now.
Oliver, the device...
it's gone.
Where's the device?
safe.
I don't know how you got that trojan onto my system, but it prompted me to take precautions.
there is nothing you can do to stop what is about to happen.
and you shouldn't.
this city needs what is about to happen in order to survive.
the people who are destroying it from the inside need to be erased from the map.
fine.
let's start with you.
ironic, isn't it?
last Christmas, I almost killed you.
a few months ago, you saved my life.
and now you're here trying to kill me.
you should make up your mind.
done.
Oh, no.
my name is Oliver Queen.
after five years on a hellish island,
I must be something else.
my first obligation is to Queen Consolidated and yours is, too.
I did some reading up on Lawton.
Lyla, listen-- Did you really think I wouldn't find out that he killed your brother?
that you were using me?
long time particularly for Bratva captain. Mr. Queen.
anatoly Knyazev, he speaks very highly of you. He should.
I saved his life.
you were supposed to sign this report at last night's board meeting.
probably because I didn't attend last night's board meeting.
where were you?
I don't.
Mr. Queen-- I thought you were serious when you said we were partners.
Isabel, I missed one meeting.
this week. Last week, it was two meetings.
Mr. Queen.
companywide revenue is at double digits since you and I took over.
Oliver! - Yes?
I'm sorry to interrupt your... Grr!
um, I need to talk to you about your plans for this evening.
you'll have to excuse me.
we have work to do. It's important.
we are going to have to work on your excuses.
you're right.
you should be more careful.
I knew you were there.
here we go.
not "we." Go home.
you got two right above you.
another at your six.
stay where you are, don't move!
I want to make a citizen's arrest.
don't move.
that's it. I'm clear.
task force X to Mockingbird.
we have the prize, we're coming home.
who are you people?
NSA? CIA?
my name is Amanda Waller.
I thought you A. R.G. U.S. guys were supposed to be more subtle.
for us, this was subtle.
then I want to see Lyla Michaels.
so do I.
agent Michaels has gone dark.
Lyla's missing?
what happened?
she was running down a lead in Moscow.
she's missed two of her scheduled call-ins.
well, what are you doing about it?
speaking to you.
even if we knew where in Russia Lyla is, my superiors believe sending in an extraction team could cause an international incident.
as far as they're concerned, she's already a framed picture on our lobby wall.
why are you telling me all this?
because I know how you and Oliver Queen spend your nights.
and I know your passport is up to date.
it would help to start with what Lyla was doing in Moscow in the first place.
what was this lead she was tracking down?
a line on the whereabouts of Floyd Lawton.
Deadshot.
Lyla was in Russia for me,
agent Michaels is an asset I can't easily replace.
I know you find her similarly irreplaceable.
bring her home, Mr. Diggle.
Thanks.
it's been a while since I arrested you.
I'd forgotten how good it feels.
I was working for...him.
him who?
the guy who cost you your shield.
I'm on his team.
you are, too.
anybody else having serious deja vu?
that's all right, we're letting him go.
our mistake.
he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
OK, uh, let's just get out of here before anyone changes their mind.
the potentially catastrophic risk of turning on this machine far outweigh any scientific gain that might come from it.
the people need to understand just how dangerous technology like this is.
and the very real possibility of a cataclysmic event.
Where'd you go?
is everything ok?
Yeah.
just need a few personal days.
what's going on?
have to help a friend.
who?
it's his spy girlfriend that works for A. R.G. U.S.
she went to Russia looking for Deadshot, for me.
now she's missing.
Felicity... I think it's time we visited our Queen Consolidated subsidiary in Moscow.
Yeah.
Oliver, what are you doing?
just need to help a friend.
I can't ask you to do that.
you didn't.
Sara... My name's Ivo.
what's your name?
so.
how did you come to be on this island, Tommy?
I assume it wasn't by choice.
my, uh... Boat was shipwrecked here.
and I was the only survivor.
well, I'm sorry to hear that.
did you explore the island much?
some of it.
Why?
you didn't happen to run across a Japanese Imperial Navy submarine, did you?
during World War II, every country was trying to develop the ultimate weapon.
the United States had the Manhattan Project, of course;
the Nazis had das Uranverein.
and the Japanese, well, they had Mirakuru.
stem cell and genetic therapies, decades ahead of their time.
every war advances the cause of science.
and the Japanese, they had developed a serum that caused increased strength.
rapid cell regeneration.
they called it Mirakuru.
miracle.
thought they could create an army of super soldiers.
they were transporting their only supply via submarine when that sub came under heavy fire by the allied forces.
and it ran aground in this chain of islands.
thanks to you... We now know it's this island.
you killed my friends.
which means it's up to you... To help us find that sub.
are you forgetting something?
where do you think you're going?
Tahiti.
that's funny.
the flight manifest says you're going to Moscow.
well, we're going to stop by there, you know, after Tahiti.
what kind of partner decides to interact with our overseas holdings behind the other one's back?
it was an oversight.
well, lucky for our partnership, I'm a fast packer.
Oliver, her tagging along does not help matters any.
I will take care of her.
we're going to bring Lyla back.
wherever she is.
I've arranged a meeting with the chief operating officer of our Moscow subsidiary tomorrow at 10: 00 a. m.
try your hardest not to miss this one.
you know, I'm not this person that you seem to think I am.
that depends. -- On what?
on if I think you use the corporate jet for a weekend of fun with your assistant.
excuse me?
a blonde I. T.girl all of a sudden gets promoted to be assistant to the C. E.O?
there are only two ways that happens.
one is nepotism, and she doesn't look like your cousin.
That...is... absolutely not happening.
what were her qualifications?
aside from an abundance of short skirts.
her skirts aren't that...short.
what was that about?
nothing.
everything with Knyazev is set.
you have friends in the Russian mafia?
color me at not at all surprised.
you're going straight to the hotel in a cab.
no, you're leaving me with her?
dig and I need to get a drink.
Well...I...wouldn't mind a drink.
ms. Loring.
didn't take you for the club-hopping type.
well, I'm here on business.
is everything ok with my mom?
we need to discuss something about this case.
your boyfriend Roy was arrested last night.
I know, but it was actually a misunderstanding.
he got released.
well, a few reporters got hold of the story and they now know you're dating a known felon.
Thea, your mother is on trial for her life.
her whole defense pivots on being seen as a loving mother who did what she had to do to protect her children, what kind of parent she was.
we need the people to know that she raised you to make good decisions.
so if you care about your mom, you're going to have to end this relationship immediately.
my favorite American!
it has been too long.
John Diggle, this is Anatoly Knyazev.
thank you for meeting us.
if Oliver vouches for you, you're my second favorite American.
first, a toast.
none for me, thanks.
Prochnost.
to strength.
now. Business.
this is woman you look for, yes?
picture is from two days ago, from gulag-- prison.
Lyla was arrested?
not quite.
from what I hear, she was trying to break in.
Why?
I do not know.
but clearly she had issues breaking back out.
gulag, worst in Russia.
it's called Koshmar.
the nightmare.
it's full of violent psychopaths and killers.
and that's just the guards.
Anatoly, we need a way into the gulag to extract her.
you get in, you get shot before you get out.
or end up like your friend.
Mmm, it's impossible.
the only thing that's impossible is us leaving this country without this woman.
I like this guy.
we have no word for "optimist" in Russian.
the only way in to Koshmar is as prisoner.
now, I have guard there, owes me favor.
it could work.
I'll give you one shot in twenty.
set it up. I'll go. -- No.
it has to be me. -- No.
Oliver, what if something happens to you in there?
what happens to me, Felicity, or Isabel, for that matter?
you have to be on the outside making the moves.
I'll go inside. I've got this.
now that is a lot of drugs.
courtesy of Knyazev.
about enough weight to land me in the Koshmar.
you need to be wearing this when they process you.
guards will take it, but that's the point.
this... Is Knyazev's man inside the prison.
a guard.
he'll know where in the gulag Lyla is being held.
when all hell breaks loose, you need to meet us at the rendezvous point with Lyla, or...
or I am a permanent Russian.
just thinking out loud... But, are we sure this is the best plan we can come up with?
I know Lyla's your friend, but... Felicity, Lyla isn't my friend.
she was my wife.
explain that sentence.
Lyla and I met in the army back in Afghanistan.
but we didn't stay married long once we got stateside.
couldn't figure out a way to stay married without a war to fight.
so she joined A. R.G. U.S.
and I circled back for my third tour.
I can't leave here without her, Felicity.
just can't.
two minute warning.
good luck, John.
they have him.
clock's running.
hurry up.
Khoroshaya kurtka.
what, uh, crime fits your punishment?
drugs. And you?
I gave speech.
about government corruption.
right.
it is rare to see one of your people in Koshmar.
what, American?
Chernokozhiy.
ehh... Chernokozhiy not popular here.
shocker.
you think Dig's ok?
I think he's doing the same as he was when you asked me five minutes ago.
they're coming.
they sell us Russian police truck for cheap.
vot mashina, kotoraya vam nuzhna.
sto pyatisot tysyach rubley.
na koleni.
Yesli vy sde syete eto, moi lyudi vas, I vashi deti osanutsya sirotami.
What'd you say?
please.
you know, in Russia, there is gulag.
almost as bad as this.
Sara-- Don't say my name.
if they find out we know each other, they'll kill us both.
I thought you drowned.
when I came up, the boat was gone.
and I thought you were, too.
and I was floating out there for days when this ship... They found me.
and they saved me.
is that why you're helping them?
I don't have a choice.
I need to warn my friends.
you said they were dead.
they're not that easy to kill.
try not to move.
it smells like puke!
it'll heal your wounds.
you have to go.
get out of here.
get to higher ground.
I'm not leaving you.
I will not be the reason something happens to you.
then we're in agreement.
because I make my own choices.
you are a strong woman.
when I care about someone, there's nothing I won't do for them.
another thing... we have in common.
the burns, they're lowering your body temperature.
here.
where you been all night?
working.
well, you deserve a break.
um, actually, I've been thinking.
maybe we should take some space.
I mean, we work together and live together.
it's kind of getting hard to breathe.
since when?
Oh, wait, does this have to with that lawyer lady dropping by?
no, this has to do with the fact that you've been arrested twice in the last month.
come on. I've been trying to stay out of trouble.
my body hasn't had a scratch on it in weeks.
well, I mean, excluding the ones that you put there.
and the other night?
was a misunderstanding.
Roy... This just isn't working, ok?
not for me.
Thea, you can't mean that.
I do. I'm sorry.
those men... They are Vory.
they are in charge.
it's best to stay away.
American... You are suka now.
are we seriously going to do this?
guess so.
fighting strictly prohibited.
Vodki, pozhaluysta.
you missed the tour.
what happened to you?
I saw a Russian vehicle that I simply had to have.
is that why you came to Russia?
car shopping?
Oh, I just ordered one.
this cold room.
six hours for you.
six hours? You can't keep me in here that long.
now seven hours.
well, that was pretty stupid... Then again, you never really were one of the brightest guys.
Deadshot.
your spine frozen through yet?
trust me.
my problem here isn't with the cold.
what, you still haven't forgiven me for shooting your brother?
man, you really hold a grudge.
I know why you're here.
that girl.
from A. R.G. U.S.
Lyla didn't find a lead on you.
she found you.
does everyone really think that Felicity and I are... -- No.
just everyone who works at Queen Consolidated.
she's just a friend.
you don't seem like the kind of man who has female friends.
can I ask you a personal question?
with some vodka in me, I just might answer.
why does saving my family's company mean so much to you?
despite what Sheryl Sandberg might say...
it still isn't that easy to make it as a woman in business.
I've...given up a lot.
which means if I don't succeed at everything, then what was the point?
may I ask you a personal question?
others have tried and failed.
why do you try so hard to make me think that you're a lazy idiot?
I know you're not.
underneath that swagger, I see you pretty clearly.
Really?
and what do you see?
you're intelligent.
driven.
and lonely.
how do you see that?
because it's what I see when I look in the mirror.
we don't have much time.
there you go. - Let's go, let's go.
nice seeing you, John.
can
I
you speak Russian.
only
I was raised in Moscow until I was nine.
and then adopted by a family that took me to America.
took me years to get rid of my accent.
it isn't easy making friends in grade school when you sound like Natasha.
sou
pay
I...Don't have a lot of time.
I'll be quick.
five minutes. Must hurry.
remind me to get you a pack of cigarettes when this is all over.
I don't smoke.
you weren't going to leave without me, were you?
I should kill you right now!
you won't.
Why?
becauseI'm the only one who knows where your little girlfriend is.
you're not stupid.
you wouldn't put yourself in here without an exit strategy.
I take you to the girl... You take me out.
Isabel, I have to go.
sorry.
do I strike you as someone who needs to cuddle?
Hi. - Hi. - It's time. Ready?
Yeah, I-- I think she can take the night off.
don't you?
even when it makes no sense whatsoever.
Guessin', uh, you want to hold on to that.
this way.
what were you thinking?
what?
over 64 million women over the age of consent in Russia and you sleep with her.
so we're not doing the "What happens in Russia stays in Russia?
we're still in Russia.
there is nothing money cannot buy in this country.
Diggle should be heading out Lyla in two minutes.
well, breaking out of prison is harder than it looks.
you of all people should know that.
stay quiet. Follow me.
you'll remember the rest of us... Yes?
I promise.
I'll come back.
come on.
are we making a swim for it? - No.
they'd shoot us the second we hit the water.
you said your friends, they have one of the radios from the ship, right?
Yeah.
you look like you know what you're doing there.
in the past year, I've learned a lot of things I never expected to.
you and me both.
they won't respond unless they hear your voice.
ni neng ting dao wo ma
can you hear me?
thank God you're alive.
Yeah, I'm on the freighter-- Sara, what are you doing?
there's only two of them.
they haven't moved from the location of the mortar attack.
what the hell is going on here?
you just confirmed that your friends are alive.
which means they're still a threat.
you know, until we kill them.
you son of a bitch--oh!
if I say she's in there, what's keeping you from shooting me?
honor.
you should try it some time.
ready to go home?
you came for me.
I always have. Always will.
Deadshot's here.
in the prison. - I know.
what's your extraction plan?
depends.
what time is it?
you
let's go, go, go, move, move, move!
this way.
got it. I shut down the phones.
the guards can't call for help.
your friend and that woman are not here by now, they will not be here at all.
much better.
on
Oliver, get down!
follow me!
move!
we're clear.
stop the truck.
get out. Get out!
move.
that's the thing about honor, John.
you can't turn it on and off.
I'm just curious.
how is it you think your brother ended up dead?
you shot a client that Andy was protecting, and you missed.
I don't miss.
your brother was the contract.
who would want to kill Andy?
I don't know the names, just an alias.
food for thought, John.
food for thought.
are we going to discuss what happened last night?
why would we?
no reason.
I'll see you in the office tomorrow.
thank you.
you had my back.
and now you know what it feels like.
wh--what are you-- what are you doing here?
good question.
I've gotten a lot of calls from prison, but never from my girlfriend's mother.
it occurred to me that I've never been given the opportunity to meet the man in your life.
I don't know if she told you, but your daughter kind of dumped me.
and what you should know is that she did it for me.
Jean told me she came to see you.
I told her she shouldn't have.
why didn't you just tell me the truth?
us being together... It can hurt her case.
Thea... Your social life is not going to be the determining factor in my trial.
sweetheart, what you've had to endure this last year is more than most people go through in two lifetimes.
but you've not only survived, you've flourished.
I think a lot of that has to do with Roy.
so, as your mother, I forbid you not to see him.
thank you.
I have to admit, this is not how I anticipated my trip to Russia ending.
I just feel lucky we made it out of there alive.
thank you.
not just for coming for me.
for doing what you had to once you did.
you mean working with Deadshot.
you know, me and Carly broke up because I couldn't love her and hate him at the same time.
I'm honored to be the exception.
Lyla, you're always the exception.
no, no, let Waller stew.
stay for breakfast.
throw in your blueberry pancakes and you may be able to convince me.
can you deliver this to Isabel's office, please?
why her?
I mean, besides the... obvious leggy model reason.
it just kind of happened.
it didn't mean anything.
because of the life that I lead...
I just think that it's better to not...
be with someone that I could really care about.
well, I think... I think you deserve better than her.
we have their location.
this one's no longer of use to us.
let's see how good you are... At removing a bullet from your head.
wait!
he could still be useful.
she's right.
once we get rid of his friends, we'll need him to lead us to the graves.
sometimes I wonder who gives the orders here.
you... or your little bouzin.
you're going back to the island.
as far as con man stories go, I think I've heard them all.
of grifters, ropers, faro-fixers, tales drawn long and tall.
but if one bears a bookmark in the confidence man's tome, it would be that of Penelope, and of the brothers Bloom.
at 10 and 13, Bloom and Stephen, the younger and the old, had been through several foster families.
No!
thirty-eight, all told.
mischief moved them on in life, and moving kept them close.
for Bloom had Stephen, and Stephen, Bloom, and both had more than most.
another home, another Main Street.
stephen looked around and summed the burg up thusly.
bloom, we've hit a one-hat town.
one theater. One car wash. One cafe. One park. One cat, which, through some mishap, had one leg.
sweet Jesus. Look at that.
one public school, one tight-knit group of local well-off kids.
their pocket-change bought rocket pops.
the brothers...
pixy Stix.
they were the they, all well-loved, rooted, happy as you please, always there in every town.
playground bourgeoisies.
could he simply...
talk to her!
just drop his fears and go?
leave his brother in the woods, and join the children?
no.
so, in the root of Stephen's psyche, something now began.
a seed of grand epiphany. A hook. A tale.
a plan. - A fiction, both for profit and to ease his brother's heart.
a simple con in 15 steps.
and this is where we start.
and then, as if a curtain had been pulled back from the sky, some barrier within the younger Bloom was broken.
Hi.
so Bloom performed his role in Stephen's story to a T.
and being who he wasn't, could be as he wished to be.
so, the tale. You tell them...
there's a hermit in the woods.
a one-eyed, steel-toothed vagabond.
with blood-red eyes? - That's good.
he stopped you, coming home from school.
and told me of a cave.
what kind of cave?
a cave of wonder.
shut up, Dave.
at noon on every Sunday, there appears a ball of light, which flutters, like a butterfly.
a will-o'-wisp? - That's right.
it guides you...
if you can keep up...
...to where the treasures lay.
so where's this cave? - Yeah, where?
the hermit didn't say.
he got this greedy, glinting look, the filthy red-eyed leech, and said he'd tell for 30 bucks.
well, that's just 2 bucks each!
and so that Sunday, straight from church, into the woods Bloom led.
they stopped. Their hearts leapt. There it was.
just like the hermit said.
for just one moment, Bloom forgot himself and ran too fast.
he'd catch the light and find the treasure, but the moment passed.
they didn't catch the will-o'-wisp, but didn't really care.
it seems to me that in the end, the perfect con is where each one involved gets just the thing they wanted.
Yeah, I guess so.
our fledgling thieves were satisfied.
the children's parents, less so.
a bitter ending? Maybe.
but there's sweetness in the mix.
the brothers Bloom had found their calling, as shown in number six.
cut" meant to negotiate.
percent," percentage deal.
O'Henry's was the town's one dry-clean shop.
pleasure doing business with you.
so how's it feel?
in truth, young Bloom won't know for 20 years just how he felt.
and so, we'll skip ahead now in our story.
let 'em melt.
he gets the scarab, you get the money, and I get the girl.
so in the end, everyone gets everything he wants.
Charleston, what have you done? Oh, my God.
Oh, God, he's dead!
he was the only one who knew where our money was buried, and you shot him! Charleston, you dunce!
the man named Charleston that you met four months and 1, 000 years ago in a hotel bar in Jodhpur is dead.
if we see each other again, it'll be as strangers.
as for the money, let it rot.
Wow!
wow" is the word you're looking for! Wow!
you're a genius, Stephen.
we're genius, Bloom.
now, in defense of that shit-eating grin on my older brother's face, what he just pulled off was pretty amazing.
he hinged the entire con on this question.
would Charleston, our spineless mark, would he actually pull that trigger?
maybe.
but Stephen wanted better odds.
he positioned me in the same spot where, six years ago,
Charleston's wife had stood and told him she was leaving.
he picked my suit to match her outfit.
he even phonetically matched my final words to hers.
this is the end, Charleston.
you've always been such a dunce.
so in the end, everyone gets everything he wants.
tastes like tinfoil.
so does real blood.
buy you a drink?
nine months and 1, 000 years ago.
he was quoting from Kipling. He stole that from Kipling.
no, he didn't.
so where's this wrap party?
make way, make room for the brothers Bloom!
Yeah, yeah!
all right, here we go. Gather round, friends and accomplices.
think of a card. You got it?
no.
if I do it enough, someday it's gonna work on someone.
and then it'll be the best damn card trick in the world.
it's true you never work with the same crew twice?
well, shit. Except for the...
you know, I'm pretty big into anime.
she's our fifth Beatle.
she knows the ins and outs.
I don't think she speaks more than three words of English.
Campari.
so, she's with you and Bloom till the end?
till the wind changes.
where is Bloom?
there you are.
you hiding?
Yep.
I've been learning.
stephen likes to talk about you.
he tell you the cave story?
is it true?
what else did he tell you?
you two kicked around until your early teens winding up in the grotty outskirts of St. Petersburg, where you learned the big con from an old-school grifter named the Diamond Dog.
is that true?
that was his name? - Yep.
and he was your mentor.
but I get the sense it ended badly.
stephen took his eye out with an antique rapier.
why did he do that?
the brothers Bloom lit out on their own to make their fortune as gentleman thieves.
sounds romantic.
it does.
you don't understand what my brother does.
he writes his cons the way dead Russians write novels, with thematic arcs and embedded symbolism and shit.
and he wrote me as the vulnerable antihero.
and that's why you think you wanna kiss me.
it's a con.
I'm going nuts.
there's the big two.
we missed the sunrise.
that would have been nice.
is this the bathroom?
no. This is camels.
hold on, I must make piss.
at least you're honest. All right, let's do this.
let's just get it done. So, first you say, "I'm quitting, Stephen. I'm out." Then I say...
do we have to go through this again? - "Go through this again?
and then you make a show of putting on your jacket, and you say, " No, I mean it this time, Stephen.
this time, I'm really out.
and then you say, "Let's have a drink,
and in the morning, Bloom, you'll have come to your senses.
it's a major design flaw in fake blood, by the way.
and we'll be moving on. - Real blood turns brown...
listen to me, Stephen. I... ...after half an hour.
this Scotch cost more than your suit.
listen to me.
the flask stopped a bullet in Normandy.
listen!
holy shit.
that's my new favorite camel.
I hate you. Okay?
Oh, God, I can't do this anymore.
I can't wake up next to another person who thinks they know me.
and I'm 35 years old. I don't...
I'm useless. I'm crippled.
I don't...
I've only ever lived life through these roles that aren't me, that are written for me by you.
tell me what you want.
Why? So you can write me a role in a story where I get it?
you're not listening to me!
I want a real thing.
I want a...
I just... I want... I... want...
I'm going away, somewhere where you and Bang Bang won't even be able to track me down.
so don't try it, okay? No more stories.
I love you. Goodbye.
how'd you find me?
how'd she find me?
how you been?
great.
I've been doing a lot of thinking the past three months, and I've come to the conclusion that you don't want out.
you think you do, but you don't.
Hey, come here. I wanna show you something.
I'm quit, Stephen.
where are we going?
new Jersey.
let me grab my coat.
so, where are we?
the largest private residence on the Eastern Seaboard, home of our final mark.
daddy was an oil tycoon, a Hearst type, built a Xanadu to match, then died hunting quail.
mom followed into the hereafter two years ago, after 10 years of fighting a disease that I can't even pronounce.
thank you. Leaving our sucker all alone on this ludicrous estate with an insane amount of very liquid assets.
what the hell is that? What are we, near an airport? What is that?
duck.
what the hell?
get the car.
bloom. - No women. One rule.
you know we don't do women.
and it's not a morality thing or a thing.
it's... Whatever it is, it doesn't matter what it is, it's just our rule. So what are we... Is this a '78 Caddy?
controversial choice.
so no, is what I'm saying, all right? I'm quits, anyway.
I'll be in Montenegro, drinking.
Ah, Penelope Stamp, 33.
lived at home her whole life.
an eccentric shut-in rich bitch? You're not helping your case.
she's bored. She's a little seed in the snow.
we're going to put her on a grand adventure, bring her to life.
she needs sprouting.
so this is the big plan, huh?
lure me back in with some beautiful, intriguing, elusive girl.
seriously, Stephen. Amateur night.
I'm not saying yes, but what's the con?
it's actually pretty simple. We're brothers, antiquities dealers.
we're traveling the world by steamer ship.
bang! Give her the old cackle-bladder and the brush-off.
and that's how it ends in Mexico, burst of violence, then a moment of truth on the beach.
what do you think?
you got something up your sleeve.
this is about me, right? Somehow.
now, this might not be something that you know, but they've all been about you.
maybe that's why they've none been perfect, because I've never been able to give you what you really wanted.
this isn't gonna give me what I want.
this will be the last one.
you'll let me go.
I'll never ask you to do another con again.
make it a Schwinn.
there are less painful ways to cut into a mark, you know.
score to beat is 7. 9.
keep your head in the game. The Japanese judge is very tough.
this is a banana seat, man!
don't give me that blank look, you know what a goddamn banana seat is.
Oh!
there's actually a knack to this.
if you're trying to fast track into a mark's sympathies, there's nothing quite as effective as having your first conversation be from a hospital bed they put you in.
what? Oh, come on.
I actually think this is kind of a great thing, and I'll tell you why.
dostoevsky was an epileptic.
his seizures were preceded by an enlightened euphoria, a sort of opening of his spiritual eye.
the next step, is to figure out a way to insinuate yourself into their personal life.
I think they took my car. Could you drive me home?
Yeah. - Okay.
I'm gonna...
step three, engagement.
find a connection with your mark through conversation.
get invited in for coffee. Tell them the full tale.
set your hook.
...didn't really have anyone except each other growing up, and our father was in the antique business. He had a shop in Charleston.
we realized one day we saw the dealers who were finding and selling us the antiques coming from exotic countries, around the world, and...
the air would, like, before a rain, you know, the ions would line up, and you could just smell midnight trains to Paris and steamer ships and Calcutta bazaars, and...
it could... Excuse me, I'm sorry, uh...
are you okay? - Yeah!
sorry. - Okay. All right.
I'm really bad at talking to people.
that's okay.
you want me to go?
no. No, I really want to talk to you.
so...
what kind of stuff do you do?
nothing. Maybe you should go.
all right, I'll just finish my...
I collect hobbies.
I see someone doing something I like, and I get books and I learn how to do it.
hmm.
anything interesting?
not really.
I really am not comfortable with this at all. - I throw my right chainsaw...
this is a running chainsaw. ...into the air and I will catch.
you just learn this stuff here by yourself?
kind of sad?
no.
so, how do you plan to use all these skills?
I don't know. I'm not a planner. I just do stuff.
like, look at this watermelon. It's a pinhole camera.
you can make a pinhole camera out of anything hollow and dark.
it's gotta warp the image though, right?
Yeah, yeah it does.
I mean, that's what's good about it.
I mean, you could point this baby at the most menial, everyday little thing, like the fabric, or your...
your face, or anything, and depending on how the pinhole eats the light, it's gonna be warped and peculiar and imperfect and odd, and it's not gonna be reproduction, it's storytelling.
it's a lie that tells the truth.
I don't know about truths.
a photograph is a secret about a secret.
the more it tells you, less you know.
what's changed between now and 20 minutes ago?
cause this is sort of like a conversation.
well, shit.
well...
I should...
it's late.
so... - So...
I meet a lot of people in my job
it's a good feeling to be genuinely interested in someone.
are you leaving?
Yeah.
Oh.
coming back?
well, next time I'm in town.
we're taking a steamer at noon tomorrow off the docks, to the continent for a few months.
Paris and Greece, I think.
I've got to get a hat.
well, thanks for the pinhole camera demonstration.
all right.
goodbye, Penelope.
goodbye, Bloom.
she isn't coming, man. I need another day with her.
you'll have two weeks with her on the boat.
I need another day to get her on the boat.
she's not hooked. I've had one session, and we mostly talked watermelons and the optics of lensless photography.
it's not the talking that hooked her.
I think you're wrong.
Hey, get out of the street, idiot!
watch it!
Hey. - Hi.
what are you doing here?
uh...
I wanna give you this money for the bike and for the whole thing.
that's all right. It's not necessary, really. - Oh.
Hey, where is this boat going?
Penelope, my brother Stephen.
glad to make your acquaintance.
Bloom's told me so much about you.
you're the epileptic photographer?
sort of.
and this is my personal assistant and private masseuse, Mrs. Yueng Ling.
Yuengling like the beer?
no.
so, what are your plans in Greece?
I don't plan. - Good for you.
you look very nice.
what was your childhood like?
I made cameras out of watermelons.
lonely?
when I was five, I got really bad rashes and allergies and hay fever.
so my mom took me to the doctor, and he did that test where they use needles to prick a grid on your back with different toxins on them, you know, to see which ones you're allergic to.
next day I come in, the doctor lifts up my shirt, and my back is a patch of oily, moldy, blackish-green double-puff marshmallows.
I was allergic to everything.
so they sealed the house with plastic and a special ventilation system, and I spent the rest of my childhood and adolescence indoors.
alone.
lonely.
Wow. - It wasn't till I was 19
they discovered what I was actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy the hypodermic needles were made out of.
then I was gonna leave, but my mom got sick. So I stayed.
she stayed sick a really long time.
do you...
feel cheated?
the trick to not feeling cheated is to learn how to cheat.
so,
I decided this wasn't a story about a miserable girl trapped in a house that smelled like medical supplies, wasting her life on a dying person she sometimes hated. No.
this was a story about a girl who could find infinite beauty in anything, any little thing.
and even love the person she was trapped with.
and I told myself this story until it became true.
now, did doing this help me escape a wasted life, or did it blind me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
I don't know. But either way,
I was the one telling my own story, so...
no, I don't feel cheated at all.
I don't suppose in all your hobby-acquiring, you ever learned how to dance?
I went through a phase when I was mildly obsessed with the bolero.
give me a minute.
it's a long time since I last encountered the brothers Bloom.
are you in antiques?
antique?
I wonder, my dear, if you know the true nature of the men you travel with.
a little fear might suit you, I think.
it isn't a Spanish band, but they'll do their best.
and then... This is the really important part.
you have to make a little, itty-bitty, little hole.
the ship's too small for us to be dancing around each other.
we might as well have this out now.
Penelope, do you know our friend?
only as the creepy Frenchman.
Book-learned. You know your languages but not your accents, mademoiselle.
no, I am Belgian. - Ah.
maximilian Melville, at your service.
also known in certain professional circles as The Curator.
pleased to make your acquaintance. What do you do?
Yeah. And yourself?
I'm an epileptic photographer.
good for you. And you boys? What do you do?
we run a legitimate antique reselling business.
we've gone straight, Max.
pardon, but why would you ascend to the great heights of the brothers Bloom just to toss it away, huh? To do what?
to sell terra cotta to blue-haired weekend antiquers?
I don't think so. - We did. Eat your waffles.
you know, the mademoiselle, she seems a little confused.
maybe she is unawares?
eat your waffles, fat man.
unawares that the brothers Bloom, in fact, are the two most respected smugglers of antiques in the Western world.
were. We've been on the straight for three years. So that's that.
Oh, oh. Well, if that is that, then that indeed is that. If you say so.
right.
no, sorry, um, 'cause I noticed before but I couldn't place it.
this ship is called the Fidele, which is the name of the ship in Melville's novel, The Confidence-Man.
I have never read that.
smugglers. It's like an adventure story.
mine. Stephen always loved the life.
then he was almost killed on a run to Jakarta.
these two thugs with heads like canned hams worked him beyond all reason.
have at me, you ham-headed bastard!
shit!
sometimes I think he'd love to die on a job.
cornered at midnight on a run to Jakarta.
that's his dream, to tell a story so well it fulfills itself.
somehow.
it would finally make it real for him.
that's kind of the thing we all want.
well, trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap.
trust me on that one.
she's different. She knows...
sometimes I feel like she knows everything.
doesn't that worry you?
no, but something about her is worrying you plenty.
she feels like one of your characters.
the day I con you is the day I die, Bloom.
how'd you get the Belgian on our budget?
he's beautiful, right?
I didn't expect him to actually be Belgian.
I'm not sure he is. I'm off to bed.
Hey.
the only real danger in this whole play is that you actually fall in love with her.
Hey, look at me.
mexico is closer than you think.
don't fall in love with her, Bloom.
good luck, boys, with the antiquing, huh.
my French is a little rusty, but I believe he said, "My proposition stands.
he came out of nowhere last night.
Mademoiselle, I will make you a proposition.
Oh, Lord. What has he got?
an 8th-century prayer book.
he steals pieces from his museum in Prague, and sells them off through smugglers.
that's what he does.
I wonder who's his fence?
it's probably his Spanish guy, right?
did he say who's buying?
Yeah, an Argentinean. Argentine? Argent...
a gentleman from the Argentine.
so, The Curator will sell it to a middleman for $1 million US, and then the Argentine... The guy from South America, he will pay $2. 5.
it's not bad.
I'm sorry you had to deal with that guy.
Where's that cab going?
train station.
Where's the train going?
Prague.
come on! Let's be smugglers.
I mean, I think it'd be fun. We should do this.
no. - Why not?
well, first off, we don't have $1 million.
that's like, I've got, what... That's whatever.
I mean, give me a real reason.
this is real. It's dangerous.
this could go very bad. - Hmm.
well, I think a little real danger might suit me, so, if you three want to join my smugglers gang,
I'II, you know, consider it.
this isn't an adventure story.
what are you talking about?
well, it totally is!
go, go, go. Go, go.
you there, come back here!
this is not for free.
wait up. Where are you?
come here. Come here.
we're smuggling.
from the snack car.
she's making a flag for our smugglers gang, man.
this afternoon, when she was writing in the observation car,
I thought she was writing a letter, a journal.
no. Come on, she's getting way too into this.
it's not funny. I don't like this Prague con you've cooked up, either.
listen, the whole point of this was to sweep her off her feet.
so why don't you let her enjoy it?
while it lasts?
this came through just now?
dear Stephen. Stop. Word on the wire is...
...the brothers B. are bound for Prague.
I'm heading there myself.
would love to see my boys. Affectionately, D. D.
our old Fagin is back. The Diamond Dog.
wire him back for me.
dear Dog. Stop.
unless you feel an excess of eyeballs left in your skull,
I highly suggest you stay far away from me and my brother. Stop.
Affectionately... Et cetera.
you've taken this train before?
Yeah. - Hmm.
so this is all just like, "Whatever" to you.
well, I mean, usually, I'd just, you know, play cards and drink with Bang Bang in the snack car.
bang who?
Yueng Ling.
bang Bang's her smuggler nickname. - Ah.
so how about me?
do I get a smuggler nickname?
no.
I think you're constipated.
in your fucking soul.
I think you might have a really big load of grumpy, petrified poop up your soul's ass.
what? - Bloom, I know
I'm pretending to be a smuggler.
right?
but what you don't know is,
I am a full-on smuggler.
cause I tell it like I own it.
you know what your problem is? You just got to stop thinking so much.
I mean, just enjoy the ride, man.
I mean...
I love thunderstorms.
Oh, my God. I'm just so horny.
Goodnight.
here's the big two.
last time I was in Prague, I was in love.
what was she like?
pale skin, long feet.
so...
and that's mine.
bloom and I will secure lodging.
miss Yueng Ling will scout out the museum.
you will go to the bank.
that wire should have cleared if you put it in at Athens.
cash? - No.
only movie thugs and Russians deal in suitcases of cash.
you're gonna get a certified check.
who the hell is that? Who is it?
a Candy-gram.
Max, it's us, for Christ's sake.
Whoa!
Max! Max, it's us, Bloom. - Max! It's Stephen and Bloom.
Jesus, Max, easy... - Jesus, whoa!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good morning.
come in. I have been drinking, you know.
so, beside the basilica, there are the offices of administration.
and underneath them, and otherwise totally inaccessible, there's a little section of catacombs.
and of course, the book.
but I am the curator, so I just walk in and I pinch the copy girl's babouche.
there's something I wanna tell you.
after I got shot...
you wanna know the very first thing that entered my mind before I blacked out?
coins.
I'm 8 years old again on a tour of the U. S. Mint.
I'm listening to a guide explain how coins are made.
how they're punched out of sheet metal.
how they're rimmed and beveled.
how they are stamped and cleaned.
and how each and every batch of coins are personally examined.
just in case any have slipped through with the slightest imperfection.
that's what popped into my head.
I am a coin in the United States Army.
I was minted in the year 1980. I've been punched from sheet metal.
I've been stamped and cleaned.
my ridges have been rimmed and beveled.
but now I have two small holes in me.
I'm no longer in perfect condition.
so there's something else I wanna tell you.
right before everything went black...
you wanna know the very last thing that entered my mind?
you.
why not? Because there are a lot of things you'd be doing.
just like playing tennis.
Wimbledon? I don't know.
just gonna go. I'm gonna host the thing. Six-thirty.
and you and I could go at 10?
Oh, shit! - Oh, no!
Oh, no, Randy, no! - I'm sorry.
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'm on it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
okay? I'm on it.
my whole life is in that bag.
I got it. I got it.
you got it.
dude. I was gonna get that.
I mean, thanks for jumping in.
Yeah, no problem.
but I mean, hey, I'll take it.
thank you so much!
who jumps off a 20-foot pier?
gosh, I'm a mess. You are a lifesaver. I'm Savannah.
John. - John.
brave man. This is my life in here, so I owe... I owe you.
don't worry about it.
nice to meet you, John. - Nice to meet you too.
you all have a good night.
Yeah, thanks. I was in the water for that.
I was seriously getting it for you.
this guy's crazy.
Yeah, no, I swear I'm not. I'm not stalking you. I just gotta get my board.
are you staying here? - Yeah, yeah, I'm from around here.
Hey, John, do you want to...? My house is right over there.
we were actually going back right now. Do you want to join us?
we're having a barbecue.
it's okay. I don't want to intrude on y'all. My dad's making dinner.
okay.
well, I could at least give you a beer for the walk home.
where is it? - Right over there.
you in the military or something? - Yeah.
Really?
what branch are you in?
army, Special Forces.
Oh, Special Forces. That's impressive. That's...
is that like a Special Forces ring they give you? Is that what it says on it?
it looks nice on you.
aren't you supposed to be wearing a hat too? Like a French hat, a beret.
that's what it's called? - Randy.
what? I'm just joking with him.
you shouldn't make fun of a guy who can kill you with his bare hands.
big guy.
rock them, sock them, let's go.
how about that?
you know, I'm gonna go get a beer.
soldier. Pleasure.
I'm sorry about him. He thinks he likes me.
Yeah, I think he likes you too.
no, I'm not his type. He just doesn't know it yet.
what?
come on, I just think you're probably everybody's type.
see what I mean?
is this who I think it is? Alan, Alan.
Hey, buddy, I want you to meet John. John, this is Alan.
Alan, nice to meet you. - Say hi.
he's a little bit shy, isn't he?
Hey, where's your dad?
over there. - Two steps behind, as usual.
sorry, he's like a heat-seeking missile every time he sees you.
Oh, hey, I'm Tim. - John.
sorry.
nice to meet you.
Oh, you Special Forces, huh?
Yes, sir.
you stationed out at Fort Bragg?
no, Germany, actually.
Oh, you're on leave. - Yes, sir.
I hope you're enjoying yourself.
Yeah, I think I am.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. It's nice to meet you though.
nice to meet you too. - Come on, son. Let's go.
let's go.
hello. Hello, John.
Hello, Alan.
wow, that was really amazing. - Yeah?
he never talks to anybody. Only his family.
he talked to you.
Yeah, but I'm practically his family. I've known him since he was born.
yeah?
when do you go back?
two weeks.
it must be scary what you do.
boring mostly. You know, long stretches of boring.
occasional flashes of scary.
full moon tonight.
do you ever notice how big the moon is when it's rising?
and how little it gets when it's up in the sky.
you know, that's just your perspective.
it doesn't matter where it is in the sky or where you are...
if you hold your hand up and close one of your eyes...
it's never bigger than your thumb.
Where'd you learn that?
I don't know.
somewhere.
you just made your own fire.
that's very impressive.
very primal.
but you're still not gonna be able to cook that hotdog, I fear.
I fear that as well.
I should probably be getting going anyways.
I'm sorry. I hope you don't get into too much trouble.
I think it's probably too late for that.
Yeah.
thank you.
Yeah. No, you're welcome.
would you wanna maybe do this again tomorrow night?
tomorrow is chicken. I don't think you're gonna wanna try it.
I was kind of hoping maybe we'd let somebody else do the cooking.
type of thing.
okay. - Yeah?
so maybe I'll come by around 6 or something?
okay. - All right.
so I'll see you soon, then?
I'll see you soon, then.
Yeah. Soon.
Hey. - Hey, man.
we're headed into town for some ice cream. You want a ride?
no, no, no, it's fine. I don't mind walking at all. It's fine.
sure?
all right. I appreciate it. - Yeah.
Hey, Alan, move on over here.
here, I'll undo your belt.
five, six, seven, eight...
so how long are you in town for? - Nine.
we live here year-round now.
Yeah, we were driving down every weekend anyways...
so I finally just convinced my wife this just made the most sense.
she didn't want ice cream? - Who?
Oh, my wife. No.
no, actually she's on vacation herself.
white sheep, white sheep, white sheep.
it's difficult to take trips together. - White sheep.
it's fine. We make it work.
I'm up here on the left.
Hey, John.
for the record, if you do anything to hurt Savannah...
I'm gonna have to break something.
something in your leg. Some... One of the bones in there.
okay.
it's just I know her father and he would expect me to say something like that.
it'd just sound a lot more natural coming out of his mouth.
it sounded fine.
it sounded fine.
no, it... - Yes, it did.
no, it didn't. - It did. It really did.
it didn't. But thank you.
it really did. - You think so?
Yeah, it did.
okay.
Hey, don't honk the horn, it's nighttime.
good night, John. - Good night, Tim.
thanks for the ride. - Yeah, no problem.
Hey, Dad, I'm not gonna be able to stay for dinner.
well, I made lasagna.
I know you made lasagna. It's Sunday.
can I borrow the car?
Thanks.
best seafood you'll ever have. - Yeah, I know.
I used to come here all the time. - Really?
are you sure you don't wanna go somewhere, I don't know, nice?
nice? No, I wanna go somewhere good.
okay.
what the hell you doing here?
come on, Steve. It's been three years already.
I don't want any trouble here.
you're not gonna get any. I promise.
all right.
thank you.
what happened with that guy out there?
what guy? - What's the story with him?
no story. - Really?
Yeah.
he's an old buddy of mine.
what?
your dad gets mad at you for coming home late last night?
no. He's not really the type that gets mad.
what kind of guy is he then?
quiet one?
could be worse, I guess. - I guess.
and your mom?
Nope, just me and my dad.
did he raise you all by himself?
Yeah.
why do you wanna know so much about my dad?
just curious.
curious about where you come from.
I wanna meet your dad.
tonight.
look, you're... You're not gonna get very much out of him.
so, I don't know, just don't take it personally, okay?
Hey, Pop.
I got somebody I want you to meet.
Hey.
this is Savannah. - Hi.
it's nice to meet you, Mr. Tyree.
he... This is my... He collects coins. He... It's kind of like his big hobby.
this is amazing.
you have so many coins. How did you get started in all this?
through John, actually.
not his thing anymore.
Hey, we should probably maybe go. - What is this coin?
that's a Sacagawean mule.
it's actually...
do you want to see some more? - Absolutely, yes, if you don't mind.
put this glove on then. - Thanks.
this is a humorous one. This is a satirical coin.
this is massive.
Yeah, William Jennings Bryan, when he ran for president...
he was... He believed in... No, don't turn it over.
leave it here.
do you remember that he had the free silver policy, you remember?
and McKinley was his opponent and he's... Wait, here.
now see, that's a real silver dollar. That's the size of a silver dollar.
and McKinley said that if Bryan had his way then the silver dollars would be that big. Yeah.
that's amazing. - Can you imagine walking around with that in your pocket?
that's really funny. - That's humorous.
now, these...
pop, we can't do this right now. We can't be here all night.
I have... I have some to show you.
this is fascinating.
these are all matched in color.
I had fun tonight.
I like your dad.
you shouldn't be too hard on him.
he loves you.
I can tell even if you can't.
whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Wait, Savannah. I mean...
so I guess I'll see you soon, then?
I'll see you soon, then.
where you been all day?
I've been busy. - You're on spring break.
you're supposed to be lounging on the beach all day.
you're not supposed to be busy doing things.
I want to show you something.
the family that lived here, their home was damaged by the hurricane.
what, so now you're rebuilding it? - Yup. Well, not just me.
you're starting to make me a little nervous.
why am I starting to make you nervous?
because I'm starting to think you might be too good of a person for me.
no, I'm not that good of a person.
you're sneaking off every day to do manual labor on a house for charity.
on your spring break. - Yeah, you're right.
it's selfish, really, me being this generous.
you don't drink, you don't smoke. - Nope. Nope.
you probably don't sleep around. - Absolutely not.
okay, look, you gotta have a fault.
I do. - Okay, care to enlighten me?
I curse.
no. - I do.
no, you don't. - I do.
I haven't heard you. - Well, that's because it's in my mind.
there's a never-ending stream of curse words that I'm thinking at all times.
okay, fine, just say one then.
no, I can't tell you because it's filthy.
right. - Yeah.
okay, all right. Fair enough.
no, I have faults, John.
trust me, I have plenty of them. You'll see.
I hope so.
we have to be finished this entire house in three weeks.
hope that actually happens.
these are to be the bedrooms, parents' room the boys' rooms, two boys, 7 and 9.
living room and the bathroom.
and then this is the kitchen.
this is the best room because the mom's a really good cook.
we're gonna make it really beautiful with white tile floors and tiles on the countertops and there's gonna be a roof.
here, John, come here. - A roof would definitely be good.
it's gonna be like this, but it's gonna be everywhere.
it's the only cover we have.
nice, we're gonna be here for a while.
Where'd you get your scar?
that one?
a knife fight.
it was five years ago, we were really drunk and the guy went for my eye.
that's terrible.
Why? He missed.
the way people act around you, the way they treated you at that restaurant.
it's like they're scared of you. - They're not scared of me.
they might be scared of who I used to be.
and who is that?
somebody different?
so when did you change? When you went into the Army?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, partly yeah.
and the other part?
I don't know, I'm still working on that.
so you used to be tough.
and maybe you still are a little bit.
you don't scare me, John. - No?
well, you scare me.
don't worry about him.
John!
what, you think you're safe in there? Okay.
No!
it's all right. Everybody understands.
what are you doing over here?
you're missing the party.
the party's just managing fine without me.
what's wrong?
why are you all the way over here by yourself?
I'm dying, John.
what?
that's not even funny.
I'm gonna miss you.
it's almost over.
no, it's not almost over.
Yes, it is.
I leave tomorrow. I have to go back to school.
so? - And you.
no, and me nothing. My commitment's up in 12 months.
and then I'm back. For good.
a lot could happen in 12 months, John.
you don't think I know that?
I know that.
and I'm not afraid at all.
I promise you...
that it'll all be over sooner than you think.
then I'll be back for good.
you promise?
I promise.
I'm probably gonna be out of the Army way before you're out of school.
am I gonna be in the audience when you graduate?
I think I might take a little longer to graduate.
been spending so much time around your dad...
and I think now I want to teach special education.
you don't say. - I don't know why it's taken me so long to realize. I mean, I've lived next to Alan my whole life...
I'm sorry, back up. What does that have to do with my dad?
well, there's...
I mean, there's an explanation for why he is the way he is.
forget it. Never mind.
no, no, no. - No, let's go. Come here.
what? So, just, what were you saying?
I grew up next to a kid with autism.
I kind of have a frame of reference. - Whoa, autistic?
you saying my dad's like Alan? You're saying my dad's retarded?
no, Alan's not retarded, John. He's autistic.
there are milder forms of it and these things go undiagnosed.
is this what you've been doing? You've just been studying my dad?
no. How could you even say that?
I've lived with my dad my entire life. I put up with him my entire life.
you think I don't know that he's not normal?
yeah?
you think I need you to tell me he's not normal?
Yeah.
Hey, soldier, leaving so soon, huh?
here, have a beer. It's on me.
come on, you should drink. It'll make you feel better.
now's not a good time, all right? - You sad?
no, come on. You just need to relax. Come on. Just relax a little bit.
what's going on with Savannah?
just leave me alone. - What's going on with Savannah?
how about you get your hands off me? - Come on.
what is happening with you and Savannah...?
Hey, man, what are you doing?
John!
Oh, my... Oh, my God!
John! - Stop him. What is he doing?
help him! - Oh, I'm so sorry.
I don't think she's home now.
but she hasn't gone back to school yet.
she normally comes by and says goodbye before she heads back, but...
Oh, shit, Tim.
Jesus, I'm sorry, man.
Hey, I like it.
I think it makes me look pretty tough.
I just... I had no idea it was you back there.
Hey, it was my fault.
I don't know what I was thinking, sneaking up behind an angry green beret.
Hey, if you see her...
can you give her a message for me?
Yeah.
just tell her I came by...
and that I...
you wanna write it down?
Yeah.
I'll make sure she gets it.
thank you.
Hey, Pop.
I didn't know if anyone else was coming so...
I made double.
no, I'll do it.
I got it, Dad. It's okay. I got it. - No, I'll do it.
they're clean. - I'll do it. I'll do it.
okay.
looks like you're gonna have leftovers for once.
Oh, I'll have it next Sunday.
excuse me, Pop.
got your note.
short, sweet, to the point. - I'm sorry.
John, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. - No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you feel that.
I have no idea what I'm talking about. I have no business pretending I'm a doctor.
I was watching him today. - John.
please, I'm serious. I don't know what I'm talking about.
I really don't. It means nothing.
okay?
I'm headed back to school.
and I just wanted to make sure that, you know...
make sure that what?
I made you a promise, didn't I?
Yeah.
you wrote your first note so I wrote mine.
don't read it now. Wait till I'm gone.
okay.
Hey, can you...? You hungry? - Yes.
yeah? My dad made a little extra for you.
you know, it's Sunday.
okay.
I can only stay a little while. - I know.
come on.
dear John...
two weeks together...
that's all it took.
two weeks for me to fall in love with you.
now we have one year apart.
but what's one year apart after two weeks like that together?
all right, Pop. - Okay.
I gotta go.
you be good, okay? - Okay.
so...
we're good. Okay. - All right. See you later.
you made me a promise.
a promise I know you'll keep.
so I only want one more promise from you during this time we spend apart.
tell me everything.
write it all down, John. Scribble it in a notebook.
type it out, E-mail it to me...
I don't care, but I wanna know everything.
then we'll be with each other all the time even if we're not with each other.
that way before we know it, I'll see you soon, then.
what's up, girls? - Johnny!
what up, man?
Hey, there he is. - Look who it is.
welcome back, John. - Look at you.
welcome back. Take a look at your voucher.
all right.
how was Atlantic City, man?
no, laugh it up. That's great. Yeah. That's the one thing I ask him.
I didn't say a word. This is the first time I've seen him.
wouldn't ask if you didn't know. - He just comes back. How could he know?
don't even bother unpacking, guys.
we move out bright and early. Enjoy.
well, I'm excited.
dear Savannah, I promise. I promise I'll see you soon, then.
I promise I'll write all the time.
I promise I'll tell you everything.
be patient with me, it may take a while for these letters to get back to you.
we've already been deployed out on a mission.
come on, soldier, move it, move it. Let's go!
the problem is we can't exactly use the local postal system here.
and there's no such thing as Internet connection.
so I have to send everything from here out by airmail.
can you get this out for me? - Yeah. Yeah.
don't lose it, all right? - Yeah, I gotcha.
unfortunately, I'm not allowed to say exactly where here is.
all I can tell you is where we've been sent makes me miss America very much.
and the lack of anything resembling an ocean makes me miss Charleston.
and everything around me makes me miss you.
we move around a lot. So letters tend to come late and out of order.
we may want to number our letters just so we know which order we wrote them in.
but when they do finally get here it's a good day.
whenever they don't... - All right, let's see here.
not for me. Not for me.
not for me. And not for me.
figures.
it's not. - Nothing for you either.
but I know they'll still come. I know it.
that's right.
letter Number 8.
dear John, I'm back at my parents' farm for the weekend.
and they have some house guests you may know.
Savannah!
Savannah!
I think that horse suits you just fine.
I took Alan out riding with me today. It was his first time on a horse.
you look good on that horse, Alan.
you've heard of horse sense, horses are somehow able to sense danger?
sense out evil?
well, I think autistic kids have that too...
so I had this idea.
this dream.
I wanna open up a summer camp for autistic kids.
I've never seen him act like this before.
are you hungry?
where they can ride horses as much as they want.
are you hungry?
for at least once in their life, a place where they won't have to worry about a thing.
what do you think? Pipe dream, huh?
no, it's not a pipe dream.
it's a perfect dream.
Erget. Merry Christmas.
John, to a Mr. John Tyree.
shut up, man. - Seven?
stop moving around. - Can I keep this one?
letter Number 33.
dear Savannah, the good news is we've been sent somewhere new.
although I can't tell you where that is either.
the bad news is, this place actually makes me miss the old place.
but it's a full moon here tonight, which makes me think of you.
because I know that no matter what I'm doing, no matter where I am...
this moon will always be the same size as yours.
half a world away.
dear John...
most nights I fall asleep worrying about you.
wondering where you may be out there.
not tonight.
tonight you're here with me.
I visited your dad yesterday.
summer's almost over and I wanted to see him before I went back to school.
I hope that's okay.
Hey.
I made you a pie.
he made me dinner. It was Sunday so we had lasagna.
and I got him talking about his coins. So we had plenty of conversation.
this one is kind of a cull, a coin that's in really bad shape.
worthless to most collectors. - But not to you.
no, not to me.
what is your favorite coin?
out of all the coins that you have, what is your absolute favorite coin?
do you have one?
seventy-eight Jefferson mule.
that'd be my favorite.
definitely.
Why? Is it worth the most?
well, it's worth a lot, not the most.
but, you know...
what's the story behind it?
here's one...
so I'll ask you instead, John, wherever you may be.
dear Savannah, only because I promised to tell you everything.
thank you.
when I was 7 years old, I bought an ice cream cone.
on the way home, I noticed one of the pennies wasn't actually a penny.
I don't know.
I don't know. Never seen anything like it.
did you find this, son?
yeah?
no, it's a mule.
it's a what? - A mule. An error coin.
every now and then they make mistakes...
batch accidentally slips through, this thing...
head's a nickel, tail's a penny. Mule. Really more of a novelty than anything.
remember the horse sense you were talking about?
the kid found it I will buy it anyway.
twenty bucks.
no, thank you. - Well, my dad has it too.
now, wait a minute. Hang on.
let me take another look at that real quick.
John, let's go.
I'll be damned.
do you know what this is? - No.
look at that.
that's your coin.
you want my advice?
dad to Dad?
keep it.
hold on to it. Pass it down to your son.
let him pass it to his son and on and on, I'll tell you what...
30, 40, a hundred years from now...
you're gonna have something worth a whole lot more than $4000.
I promise you.
Hey.
do you want to keep it?
good for you. - Thank you. Thank you.
at first I loved chasing after those mules with my father.
we finally had something to talk about.
you know, something we could do together.
but he became obsessed with them. You know how he is.
and then I became a teenager and you know how I am.
all the way up to Wooster for another coin show. I'm just...
no, I'm not doing that.
you're going to one every weekend now.
Oh, that's good. I love warm milk. That's nice.
you spend all of our money on coins. Get a fricking fridge that works.
eventually he stopped talking about coins with me altogether.
and when that happened we found there wasn't all that much left to talk about.
so that's the story.
I miss you so much it hurts.
sorry, sorry.
Oh, my God. My brother was in the towers.
I love you too, babe. - Please call me as soon as you can.
Susan. Susan, is my dad there? - Just calm down.
all right, fellas, here's the deal.
requesting permission to extend my tour, Sir.
requesting permission to extend, Sir.
requesting permission to extend as well, Sir.
requesting permission to extend, Sir.
requesting permission to extend as well, Sir.
okay, guys, listen. We're gonna get our orders from Operations on Monday.
before we do anything rash, let's take the weekend to mull this over, all right?
I got a wife and kids to think about here.
nobody's asking you to stay on too, Captain.
Yeah, you are. This is my team.
where you go, I go.
where we go, we all go.
if everyone still wants to extend on Monday, then we'll do it.
together.
don't get into trouble over there.
take care of yourself. - Always.
let's go, man. The plane to Paris leaves in an hour.
you ready? Are you ready?
it's gonna be amazing. - I can't go.
what are you talking about? Of course you're going.
I gotta go to Charleston.
you're going to Charleston? - Yup.
what are you, nuts? We got two days off, man.
by the time you fly there and back, you're gonna have like 18 hours.
it's 18 more than I had this morning.
I don't know when I'll get that again...
so I gotta go.
nothing I can say to change your mind?
Nope.
John!
John. John.
man: There's something I wanna tell you.
after I got shot, you wanna know the very first thing that entered my mind before I blacked out?
coins.
I'm 8 years old again on a tour of the U.S. Mint.
I'm listening to a guide explain how coins are made.
how they're punched out of sheet metal.
how they're rimmed and beveled.
how they are stamped and cleaned.
and how each and every batch of coins are personally examined just in case any have slipped through with the slightest imperfection.
that's what popped into my head.
I am a coin in the United States Army.
I was minted in the year 1980. I've been punched from sheet metal.
I've been stamped and cleaned.
my ridges have been rimmed and beveled.
but now I have two small holes in me.
I'm no longer in perfect condition.
so there's something else I wanna tell you.
right before everything went black, you wanna know the very last thing that entered my mind?
you.
woman: Why not? Because there are a lot of things that you'd be doing.
just like playing tennis.
Randy: Wimbledon? I don't know.
just gonna go. I'm gonna host the thing. Six-thirty.
and you and I could, like, go at 10?
Randy: Oh, shit! SAVANNAH: Oh, no!
Oh, no, Randy, no! I'm sorry. I'm...
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'm on it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
okay? I'm on it.
my whole life is in that bag.
I got it. I got it.
you got it.
dude. I was gonna get that.
Yeah, I just... I mean, thanks for jumping in.
Yeah, no problem.
but I mean, hey, I'll take it.
thank you so much!
Randy: Who jumps off a 20-foot pier?
Wow. Ugh.
gosh, I'm a mess. You are a lifesaver. I'm Savannah.
John. John.
brave man. Uh, this is my life in here, so I owe...I owe you. Don't worry about it.
nice to meet you, John. Nice to meet you too.
y'all have a good night.
Yeah, thanks. I was in the water for that.
I was seriously getting it for you.
Randy: This guy's crazy. JOHN: Yeah, no, I swear I'm not.
I'm not stalking you. I just gotta get my board.
SAVANNAH: Um, are you staying here?
John: Yeah, yeah, I'm from around here.
SAVANNAH: Hey, John, do you want to...? My house is right over there.
we were actually going back right now.
do you want to join us?
we're just gonna have a barbecue.
no, it's okay. I don't want to, you know, intrude on y'all. My dad's making dinner, so...
okay.
well, I could at least give you a beer for the walk home.
where is it? Right over there.
you in the military or something? Yeah.
Really? Mm-hm.
what branch are you in?
army, Special Forces.
Oh, Special Forces. That's, uh...That's impressive. That's...
is that like a Special Forces ring they give you? Is that what it says on it?
it looks nice on you.
aren't you supposed to be wearing a hat too? Like a French hat, a beret.
right? That's what it's called? SAVANNAH: Randy. Randy?
what? I'm just joking with him.
you shouldn't make fun of a guy who can kill you with his bare hands.
Oh-ho! Ooh. Ooh! Big guy.
rock them, sock them, let's go.
how about that?
you know, I'm gonna go get a beer.
soldier. Pleasure.
I'm sorry about him. He thinks he likes me.
Yeah, I think he likes you too.
no, I'm not his type. He just doesn't know it yet.
what?
come on, I just think you're probably everybody's type.
Whoa! See what I mean?
is this who I think it is? Alan, Alan.
Whoa! Hey, buddy, I want you to meet my friend John.
John, this is Alan. Alan, nice to meet you.
say hi.
he's a little bit shy, isn't he?
Hey, where's your dad?
over there.
man: Two steps behind, as usual.
sorry, he's like a heat-seeking missile every time he sees you.
Oh, hey, I'm Tim. JOHN: John.
SAVANNAH: Sorry.
John: Nice to meet you.
TIM: Oh, you Special Forces, huh?
John: Uh, yes, sir.
you, uh, stationed out at Fort Bragg?
no, uh, Germany, actually.
Oh, you're on leave. Yes, sir.
Oh. Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself.
Yeah, uh, I think I am.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. It's nice to meet you though.
nice to meet you too. Come on, son. Let's go.
let's go.
hello. Hello, John.
Hello, Alan.
wow, that was really amazing.
yeah? He never talks to anybody.
only his family.
he talked to you.
Yeah, but I'm practically his family. I've known him since he was born.
yeah?
when do you go back?
two weeks.
it must be scary what you do.
boring mostly. You know, long stretches of boring.
occasional flashes of scary.
full moon tonight.
do you ever notice how big the moon is when it's rising?
and how little it gets when it's up in the sky.
John: You know, that's just your perspective.
it actually doesn't matter where it is in the sky or where you are in the world if you hold your hand up and close one of your eyes.
it's never bigger than your thumb.
SAVANNAH: Where' d you learn that?
John: I don't know.
somewhere.
SAVANNAH: Wow.
you just... You just made your own fire.
that's very impressive.
very primal.
but you're still not gonna be able to cook that hotdog, I fear.
I fear that as well.
I should probably be getting going anyways.
I'm sorry. I hope you don't get into, um, too much trouble.
I think it's probably too late for that.
thank you.
Yeah. No, you're welcome.
would you wanna maybe do this again tomorrow night?
tomorrow night is chicken.
I don't think you're gonna wanna try it.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping maybe we'd let somebody else do the cooking.
type of thing.
okay. Yeah?
so maybe I'll come by around, uh, 6 or something?
okay. All right.
so I'll see you soon, then?
I'll see you soon, then.
Yeah. Soon.
TIM: Hey. Hey, man.
we're headed into town for some ice cream. You want a ride?
no, no, no, it's fine. I don't mind walking at all. It's fine. Heh.
sure?
all right. I appreciate it. Yeah.
Hey, Alan, move on over here.
here, I'll undo your belt.
Alan: Five, six, seven, eight,
so how long y'all in town for? Nine.
Oh, we live here year-round now.
Yeah, we were driving down every weekend anyways, so I finally just convinced my wife this just made the most sense.
she didn't want ice cream? TIM: Who? Oh, my wife?
John: Mm-hm. Uh, no.
no, actually she's on vacation herself.
white sheep, white sheep, white sheep.
it's kind of difficult to take trips together.
white sheep.
it's fine. We make it work.
I'm up here on the left.
TIM: Hey, uh, John.
for the record, if you do anything to hurt Savannah, I'm gonna have to break something.
something in your leg. Some... One of the bones in there.
okay.
it's just I know her father and he would expect me to say something like that.
it'd just sound a lot more natural coming out of his mouth.
it sounded fine.
it sounded fine.
no, it... Yes, it did.
no, it didn't. It did. It really did.
it didn't. But thank you.
Alan: It really did. TIM: You think so?
Alan: Yeah, it did. TIM: Okay.
TIM: Hey, don't honk the horn, it's nighttime.
TIM: Good night, John. JOHN: Good night, Tim.
thanks for the ride. Yeah, no problem.
Hey, Dad, I'm not, uh, gonna be able to stay for dinner.
well, I made lasagna.
I know you made lasagna. It's Sunday.
um...
can I borrow the car?
Thanks.
SAVANNAH: Best seafood you'll ever have.
Heh. Yeah, I know.
I used to come here all the time. Really?
are you sure you don't wanna go somewhere, I don't know, nice?
nice? No, I wanna go somewhere good.
okay.
what the hell you doing here?
come on, Steve. It's been three years already.
I don't want any trouble here.
John: You're not gonna get any. I promise.
all right.
thank you.
what happened with that guy out there?
what guy? What's the story with him?
no story. Really?
Yeah.
he's an old buddy of mine.
what?
your dad get mad at you for coming home late last night?
no. Uh-uh. He's not really the type that gets mad.
what kind of guy is he then?
um...
quiet one?
could be worse, I guess. I guess.
and your mom?
Nope, just me and my dad.
did he raise you all by himself?
Yeah.
why do you wanna know so much about my dad?
just curious.
curious about where you come from.
I wanna meet your dad.
tonight.
John: Look, you're... You're not gonna get very much out of him.
so, I don't know, just don't take it personally, okay?
Hey, Pop.
I got somebody I want you to meet.
SAVANNAH: Hey.
John: This is Savannah.
Hi.
it's nice to meet you, Mr. Tyree.
Wow. He... This is my...
he collects coins. He, um... It's kind of like his big hobby.
this is amazing.
you have so many coins. How did you get started in all this?
uh... Uh... Through John, actually.
but it's not his thing anymore.
Hey, you know, we should probably maybe go.
SAVANNAH: What is this coin? MR. TYREE: Uh...That's a... That's a Sacagawean mule.
it's actually... Wow, it's a mule.
do you want to see some more? Absolutely, yes, if you don't mind.
put this, uh, glove on then.
Thanks.
Mr. TYREE: This is a humorous one. This is a satirical coin.
this is massive.
Yeah, William Jennings Bryan, when he ran for president, he was... He believed in... No, don't turn it over.
leave it here.
do you remember that he had the free silver policy. You remember.
Oh.
and McKinley was his opponent and he's... Wait, here.
now see, that's a real silver dollar. That's the size of a silver dollar.
and McKinley said that Wow. That's so weird.
if Bryan had his way, then the silver dollars would be that big. Yeah.
that's amazing.
can you imagine? No.
walking around with that in your pocket?
SAVANNAH: That's really funny. MR. TYREE: That's humorous.
now, these...
pop, we can't do this right now. I gotta... We can't be here all night.
I have... I have some to show you.
this is fascinating.
Mr. TYREE: These are all matched in color.
I had fun tonight.
I like your dad.
you shouldn't be too hard on him.
he loves you.
I can tell even if you can't.
whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Wait, Savannah. I mean...
so I guess I'll see you soon, then?
I'll see you soon, then.
where you been all day?
I've been busy.
you're on spring break.
you're supposed to be lounging on the beach all day.
you're not supposed to be busy doing things.
I want to show you something.
SAVANNAH: The family that lived here, their home was severely damaged by the hurricane.
John: What, so now you're rebuilding it?
SAVANNAH: Yup. Well, not just me.
you're starting to make me a little nervous.
why am I starting to make you nervous?
because I'm starting to think you might be too good of a person for me.
Oh. No, I'm not that good of a person.
you're sneaking off every day to do manual labor on a house for charity.
on your spring break. Yeah, you're right.
it's selfish, really, me being this generous.
but no, seriously.
you don't drink, you don't smoke. Nope. Nope.
you probably don't sleep around. Absolutely not.
okay, look, you gotta have a fault.
I do. Okay, care to enlighten me?
I curse.
no. I do.
no, you don't. Yes, I do.
I haven't heard you.
well, that's because it's in my mind.
there's a never-ending stream of curse words that I'm thinking at all times.
okay, fine, just say one then.
no, I can't tell you because it's filthy.
right. Yeah.
okay, all right. Fair enough.
no, I have faults, John.
trust me, I have plenty of them. You'll see.
I hope so.
SAVANNAH: We have to be finished with this entire house in three weeks.
hope that actually happens.
um, these are gonna be the bedrooms, the parents' room, the boys' rooms, two boys, 7 and 9.
uh, living room and the bathroom.
and then this is the kitchen.
this is the best room because the mom's a really good cook.
we're gonna make it really beautiful with white tile floors and tiles on the countertops, and there's gonna be a roof. Ah!
here, John, come here. A roof would definitely be good.
it's gonna be like this, but it's gonna be everywhere.
it's the only cover we have.
nice, we're gonna be here for a while.
Where'd you get your scar?
Hm? That one?
a knife fight.
it was five years ago, we were really drunk and the guy went for my eye.
that's terrible.
Why? He missed.
the way people act around you, the way they treated you at that restaurant...It's like they're scared of you. They're not scared of me.
they might be scared of who I used to be.
and who is that?
somebody different?
so when did you change? When you went into the Army?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, partly yeah.
and the other part?
I don't know, I'm still working on that.
so you used to be tough.
and maybe you still are a little bit.
Mm-hm.
you don't scare me, John. No?
well, you scare me.
don't worry about him.
SAVANNAH: John!
John: Heh. Oh!
what, you think you're safe in there? Okay.
SAVANNAH: No!
it's all right. Everybody understands.
Oh! Wow.
what are you doing over here?
Hm? You're missing the party.
the party's just managing fine without me.
what's wrong? Hm?
why are you all the way over here by yourself?
I'm dying, John.
what?
that's not even funny.
I'm gonna miss you.
it's almost over.
no, it's not almost over.
Yes, it is. Mm-mm.
I leave tomorrow. I have to go back to school.
so? And you.
no, and me nothing. My commitment's up in 12 months.
and then I'm back. For good.
a lot could happen in 12 months, John.
you don't think I know that?
I know that.
and I'm not afraid at all.
I promise you that it'll all be over sooner than you think.
then I'll be back for good.
you promise?
I promise.
I'm probably gonna be out of the Army way before you're out of school.
am I gonna be in the audience when you graduate?
Oh, I think I might take a little longer to graduate.
been spending so much time around your dad, and I think now I want to teach special education.
you don't say.
I don't know why it's taken me so long to realize.
I mean, I've lived next to Alan my whole life...
wait, I'm sorry, back up. What does that have to do with my dad?
Um...Well, there's...I mean, there's an explanation for why he is the way he is.
forget it. Never mind.
no, no, no. No, let's go. Come here.
what? So, just, what were you saying?
um...I grew up next to a kid with autism.
I kind of have a frame of reference. Whoa, whoa, whoa, autistic?
you saying my dad's like Alan? You're saying my dad's retarded or something?
no, Alan's not retarded, John. He's autistic.
and there are milder forms of it, and these things go undiagnosed.
is this what you've been doing?
this entire time you've just been studying my dad?
no. How could you even say that?
I've lived with my dad my entire life.
I've put up with him my entire life.
you think I don't know that he's not normal?
yeah?
you think I need you to tell me he's not normal?
Yeah.
Randy: Hey, soldier, leaving so soon, huh?
here, have a beer. It's on me.
come on, you should drink that. It'll make you feel better.
now's not a good time, all right? You a little sad?
no, come on. You just need to relax, okay? Come on. Just relax a little bit.
look, how about just...? What's going on with Savannah?
just leave me alone, all right? What's going on with Savannah?
how about you get your hands off me?
come on, soldier.
what is happening with you and Savannah...?
Hey, man, what are you doing?
John!
woman: Oh, my... Oh, my God!
SAVANNAH: John!
woman: Stop him. What is he doing?
woman: Help him! Oh, I'm so sorry.
I don't think she's home now.
but she hasn't gone back to school yet.
she normally comes by and says goodbye before she heads back, but...
Oh, shit, Tim.
Jesus, I'm sorry, man.
Hey, I like it.
I think it makes me look pretty tough.
I just... I had no idea it was you back there.
Hey, it was my fault.
I don't know what I was thinking, sneaking up behind an angry green beret like that.
Hey, if you see her, can you give her a message for me?
Yeah.
just tell her I came by and that I...
you wanna write it down?
Yeah.
I'll make sure she gets it.
thank you.
Hey, Pop. Uh...I didn't know if anyone else was coming, so I made double.
no, I'll do it.
I got it, Dad. It's okay. I got it. No, I'll do it.
they're clean, Pop. I'll do it. I'll do it.
okay.
looks like you're gonna have leftovers for once.
Oh, I'll have it next Sunday.
excuse me, Pop.
got your note.
short, sweet, to the point. I'm sorry.
SAVANNAH: John, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
John: No, I'm sorry.
SAVANNAH: I didn't mean to make you feel that way.
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
I had no business pretending I'm a doctor.
I was watching him today. John.
please, I'm serious. I don't know what I'm talking about.
I really don't. It means nothing.
okay?
I'm headed back to school.
and I just wanted to make sure that, you know...
make sure that what?
I made you a promise, didn't I?
Yeah.
um, you wrote your first note so I wrote mine.
don't read it now. Wait till I'm gone.
okay.
Hey, can you...? You hungry? Yes.
yeah? My dad made a little extra for you.
you know, it's Sunday.
okay.
I can only stay for a little while. I know.
come on.
SAVANNAH: Dear John, two weeks together, that's all it took.
two weeks for me to fall in love with you.
now we have one year apart.
but what's one year apart after two weeks like that together?
John: All right, Pop. MR. TYREE: Okay.
I gotta go. Um...You be good, okay? Okay.
So...We're good. All right.
see you later. Okay.
you made me a promise.
a promise I know you'll keep.
so I only want one more promise from you during this time we spend apart.
tell me everything.
write it all down, John. Scribble it in a notebook.
type it out, e-mail it to me, I don't care, but I wanna know everything.
and that way we'll be with each other all the time, even if we're not with each other at all.
that way before we know it, I'll see you soon, then.
what's up, girls? MAN 1: Johnny!
whoa. What up, man?
man 2: Hey, there he is. MAN 3: Look who it is.
man 4: Welcome back, John. MAN 5: Aw, look at you.
welcome back. Take a look at your voucher.
all right.
how was Atlantic City, man?
no, laugh it up. That's great. Yeah. That's the one thing I ask him.
I didn't say a word. This is the first time I've seen him.
you wouldn't ask if you didn't know. How could he know?
man 6: Don't even bother unpacking, guys.
we move out bright and early. Enjoy.
man 7: Well, I'm excited.
John: Dear Savannah, I promise. I promise I'll see you soon, then. I promise I'll write all the time. I promise I'll tell you everything.
be patient with me, it may take a while for these letters to get back to you.
we've already been deployed out on a mission.
stone: Come on, soldier, move it, move it. Let's go!
the problem is we can't exactly use the local postal system here.
and there's no such thing as Internet connection.
so I have to send everything from here out by airmail.
can you get this out for me? Yeah. Yeah.
don't lose it, all right? Yeah, I gotcha.
unfortunately, I'm not allowed to say exactly where here is.
so all I can tell you is that the place that we've been sent makes me miss America very much.
and the lack of anything resembling an ocean makes me miss Charleston.
and everything around me makes me miss you.
we move around a lot. So letters tend to come late and out of order.
we may want to number our letters from here on out, though, just so we know which order we wrote them in.
but when they do finally get here, it's a good day.
whenever they don't...
noodles: All right, let's see here.
not for me. Not for me.
not for me. And not for me.
figures. It's not.
sorry, dude. Nothing for you either.
but I know they'll still come. I know it.
that's right.
SAVANNAH: Letter Number 8.
dear John, I'm back at my parents' farm for the weekend.
and they have some house guests you may know.
Alan: Savannah!
Savannah!
I think that horse suits you just fine.
I took Alan out riding with me today. It was his first time on a horse.
you're looking good on that horse, Alan.
you've heard of horse sense, how horses are somehow able to sense danger?
sense out evil?
well, I think autistic kids have that too, so I had this idea.
this dream.
I wanna open up a summer camp for autistic kids.
I've never seen him act like this before.
Alan: Are you hungry?
a place where they can ride horses as much as they want.
are you hungry?
for at least once in their life, a place where they won't have to worry about a thing.
what do you think? Pipe dream, huh?
John: No, it's not a pipe dream.
it's a perfect dream.
Erget. Merry Christmas.
John, to a Mr.John Tyree.
shut up, man. Seven?
stop moving around. Can I keep this one?
John: Letter Number 33.
dear Savannah, the good news is we've been sent somewhere new.
although I can't tell you where that is either.
the bad news is, this place actually makes me miss the old place.
but it's a full moon here tonight, which makes me think of you.
because I know that no matter what I'm doing, no matter where I am, this moon will always be the same size as yours.
half a world away.
SAVANNAH: Dear John, most nights I fall asleep worrying about you. Wondering where you may be out there.
not tonight.
tonight you're here with me.
I visited your dad yesterday.
summer's almost over and I wanted to see him before I went back to school.
I hope that's okay.
Hey.
I made you a pie.
he made me dinner. It was Sunday so we had lasagna.
and I got him talking about his coins. So we had plenty of conversation.
this one is kind of a cull, a coin that's in really bad shape.
worthless to most collectors.
but not to you.
no, not to me.
what is your favorite coin?
out of all the coins that you have, what is your absolute favorite coin?
do you have one?
Mr. TYREE: 'Seventy-eight Jefferson mule.
SAVANNAH: Wow. MR. TYREE: That'd be my favorite.
definitely.
Why? Is it worth the most?
well, it's worth a lot, not the most.
but, you know...What's the story behind it?
um...
here's one...
so I'll ask you instead, John, wherever you may be.
John: Dear Savannah, only because I promised to tell you everything.
thank you.
when I was 7 years old, I bought an ice cream cone.
on the way home, I noticed one of the pennies wasn't actually a penny.
I don't know.
I don't know.
never seen anything like it.
did you find this, son? Huh?
yeah?
no, it's a mule.
it's a what? A mule. An error coin.
every now and then they make a mistake, batch accidentally slips through, this thing, head's a nickel, tail's a penny. Thing's a mule.
really more of a novelty than anything.
remember the horse sense you were talking about?
the kid found it I will buy it anyway.
twenty bucks. Huh?
no, thank you.
well, my dad has it too.
now, wait a minute. Hang on.
Hey, sir. Sir, let me take another look at that real quick.
John, let's go.
I'll be damned.
do you know what this is? No.
look at that.
that's your coin.
you want my advice?
keep it.
hold on to it. Pass it down to your son.
let him pass it to his son and on and on and on, and I'll tell you what, 30, 40, a hundred years from now...you're gonna have something worth a whole lot more than $4000.
I promise you.
Hey.
do you want to keep it?
good for you. Thank you. Thank you.
at first I loved chasing after those mules with my father.
we finally had something to talk about.
you know, something we could do together.
but he became obsessed with them. You know how he is.
and then I became a teenager and you know how I am.
all the way up to Wooster for another coin show. I'm just...
no, I'm not doing that.
you're going to one every weekend now.
Oh, that's good. I love warm milk. That's nice.
you spend all of our money on coins.
get a fricking fridge that works.
eventually he stopped talking about coins with me altogether.
and then when that happened, we found there wasn't all that much left to talk about.
so that's the story.
I miss you so much it hurts.
sorry, sorry.
girl: Oh, my God. My brother was in the towers.
boy 1: I love you too, babe.
boy 2: Please call me as soon as you can.
boy 3: Susan. Susan, is my dad there?
boy 4: Just calm down.
all right, fellas, here's the deal.
requesting permission to extend my tour, sir.
requesting permission to extend as well, sir.
requesting permission to extend as well, sir.
requesting permission to extend as well, sir.
requesting permission to extend as well, sir.
stone: Okay, guys, listen.
we're gonna get our orders from Operations on Monday.
so before we do anything rash, let's take the weekend to mull this all over, all right?
I got a wife and kids to think about here.
Daniels: Nobody's asking you to stay on too, captain.
stone: Yeah, you are. This is my team.
where you go, I go.
where we go, we all go.
if everyone still wants to extend on Monday, then we'll do it.
together.
y'all don't get into trouble over there.
take care of yourself.
always.
yo, let's go, man. The plane to Paris leaves in an hour.
you ready? Are you ready?
it's gonna be amazing. I can't go.
what are you talking about? Of course you're going.
I can't go to Paris. I gotta go to Charleston.
you're going to Charleston? Yup.
dude, what are you, nuts? We got two days off, man.
by the time you fly there and back, you're gonna have like 18 hours on the ground, tops.
it's 18 more than I had this morning.
I don't know when I'll get that again, so I gotta go.
all right, man. Nothing I can say to change your mind?
Nope.
SAVANNAH: John!
John. John.
Greg?
september
Greg? What?
Greg! Huh? What?
what are you doing? Get up!
mom and Dad have been calling you for an hour.
you're about to be late for your first day of middle school.
what?
Oh, geez! How did that happen?
go, go, go! Mom's about to flip out!
she sent me to get you while she waits in the car!
what are you doing? What's going on?
getting ready for...
school.
are you insane? School doesn't start till next week.
and, FYI, school doesn't start at 4: 00 in the morning!
you woke up Manny. And if he doesn't go back down...
good morning!
there is no way he is going back down.
I just wanted to sleep till 6: 00.
Bubby! Go to bed. I got him.
Greg, what are you doing up making all this noise?
it was Rodrick! He woke me up!
he changed my clock!
but I swear, he was just...Go to bed.
what is that smell? I can't even identify it.
Bubby!
happy Birthday!
here, Bubby.
Wow! Look at the size of that flamethrower!
okay, first of all, let me get something straight.
this is a journal, not a diary.
Yeah, I know what it says on the cover.
but when my mom went out to buy this thing,
I specifically told her not to buy one that said "diary" on it.
this just proves Mom doesn't understand anything about kids my age.
huh? Sissy!
the only reason I agreed to write in this thing is because when I'm rich and famous I'll have better things to do than answer people's stupid questions all day long.
Gregory, tell us about your childhood!
were you always so smart and handsome?
here's my journal. Now, shoo, shoo.
that's our boy up there.
why did I ever say no to him?
mom got me this thing so I could write down my feelings about starting middle school.
but I'm gonna be fine.
it's my best friend, Rowley Jefferson, I'm worried about.
he's definitely not middle school ready.
Geronimo!
he's not quite clear on the concept of growing up.
I want a puppy, a kitty, a gumball machine...
but anyway, this is about me, not Rowley.
I always figured they'd make a movie about my life.
but I didn't think they'd start the story here.
because, seriously, who wants to see a movie about a kid who's stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons?
three days, no shower. Smell the love!
let me go, Rodrick!
come on. We're just having some fun, right?
no, okay. So, look.
mom asked me to give you some advice about middle school.
it's real simple.
don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. Don't go anywhere.
don't sit down. Don't raise your hand. Don't go to the bathroom.
don't get noticed. Don't choose the wrong locker. Don't...
who am I kidding?
you'll be dead or homeschooled by the end of the year, anyway.
and don't be seen with Rowley.
Manny, stop it! Mom!
thanks for the eggs, Mom.
Frank? Greg?
I think it's gross and undignified that I have to eat breakfast next to him on the potty.
okay, well, it's your fault he's still potty training.
don't look down, Manny.
the potty monster doesn't like it when you look at him.
I was just joking with him.
okay. Kiss him you're sorry and then let's get a move on.
can't be late for your first day of school.
let me just say for the record that I think middle school may be the dumbest idea ever invented.
you got kids like me who haven't hit their growth spurt yet mixed in with gorillas who have to shave twice a day.
there's juvenile delinquents and weirdoes.
I'm smaller than about 95% of the kids at my school...
give it back! Stop!
so thank God for Chirag Gupta.
it's mine! Stop! Can I have the backpack?
you got to jump higher. It's not yours!
he's an excellent buffer between me and these morons.
Hey, Greg.
Hey, fella!
seriously, I don't know what happened to these kids over the summer.
was there a nuclear accident?
science experiment gone bad?
thank God there are a few normal people or this place would be a total freak show.
if you're as discriminating as I am, it can be tough to figure out where to sit on your first day of middle school.
one bad move and you're stuck next to some idiot for the rest of the year.
Greg!
remember how I said Rowley wasn't middle school ready?
well, there you go.
what are you wearing?
my family just got back from Guatemala! It's my serape!
nice, huh?
all right, class, I'm Mrs. Flint. Everybody take your seats!
welcome to your first day of middle school.
remember your seats. You'll be sitting here every day.
Rowley, if you had to say where you were ranked in terms of popularity from one to 200, where would you put yourself?
is 200 good or bad?
I'd say you're somewhere around the 154 mark.
I'd put myself around number 19 or 20.
I might even have a shot at the top spot by the end of the year, if things go the way I think they will.
well, who's at the bottom?
Hey, guys, wanna see my secret freckle?
Fregley. Sent home for hygiene issues at least once a month.
check it out. It's got a hair in it!
what color is that?
you wanna help me name it?
all right, ladies! Gather around!
come on, put the knitting down! Let's go!
all right, everybody.
I'm Coach Malone and I am your gym teacher.
P. E. is as much a part of my life as waking up in the morning and going to the bathroom.
I live and breathe Physical Education.
now, who's with me?
are you ready to have some fun out there?
Yeah!
all right, outstanding!
so we're gonna divide you up into two teams.
so you two, over here. You, you, you, this way.
Yeah, you three, this side. Good.
you guys are going to be Shirts!
and you will be Skins.
why are we Skins? I hate this.
he's just trying to make kids like us feel bad.
what do you mean, kids like us?
I just don't want to get a sunburn, right, Rowley?
my name is Bell E. Button.
what's yours?
okay, let's start off with a little game I like to call Gladiator.
I got this one! No!
take that!
cover me!
Oh, God.
not good!
we're never going to be able to outrun these guys!
we don't have to outrun them!
we just have to outrun Chirag!
take a look, take a look, take a look.
at the kids on the street. No, they never miss a beat. Never miss a beat. Never miss a beat. Never miss a beat. Never miss a beat
think they saw us? No way.
they were focused on getting that kid with the limp.
we'll hide here for the rest of the class because I'm not playing that game.
it's not fair.
he's got all the Neanderthals on the same team. It's barbaric!
it's completely barbaric.
this place is an intellectual wasteland.
but, you know, it's nice to meet someone more interested in his mind than in his body.
you girls get to jump rope. What are you doing hiding?
avoiding the pain.
it all starts in middle school, you know?
you're not a kid anymore. The coddling has stopped.
kids are now separated by intelligence. The weak are picked on.
and girls you've known since kindergarten won't even talk to you anymore.
okay, well, sounds like you got it all figured out, so go back to your book.
this place is a glorified holding pen.
all the way! All the way! You're like a machine!
it's where adults put you as you make that awkward transition between child and teenager so they don't even have to look at you.
Hi. I'm Angie.
great story. We're gonna go now.
Why? This is a good spot.
it's a perfect spot.
I survived all of the sixth grade here.
and I would enjoy some like-minded company to get me through the seventh.
is that the whistle? I think I hear the whistle.
we need to go.
no showboating, all right?
why are we leaving?
we could get killed out here in the open!
put your shirt on. They'll think we're on their team.
besides, getting crushed is better than being seen with that freak job.
trust me, you can't recover from social suicide.
I never talked to a girl that long before.
check that out.
is that cheese?
stop!
good God, man! You almost got the Cheese Touch.
the what? The Cheese Touch.
nobody knows when or how, but one day that cheese mysteriously appeared on the blacktop.
nobody knew who it belonged to.
nobody touched it. Nobody threw it away.
and so there it sat, growing more foul and powerful by the day.
then one day, a kid named Darren Walsh made the biggest mistake of his life.
Darren touched the cheese!
no, I didn't! I just looked at it! Really!
Darren had the Cheese Touch!
it was worse than nuclear cooties.
he became an outcast.
the only way to get rid of the Cheese Touch was by passing it on to someone else.
and so began the Cheese Touch Frenzy.
friend turning on friend.
brother turning on sister.
it was madness.
until a German exchange student named Dieter Muller took it away.
dieter has the Cheese Touch!
ze Cheese Touch?
vat is it?
vat does it mean, ze Cheese Touch??
sadly for Dieter, that fact was lost in translation.
Nooooooooooooooo...!
thankfully, he moved back to Dusseldorf and took the Cheese Touch with him.
and so the cheese sits, patiently waiting for its next victim.
this is a terrible place.
no doors? None.
I'm not pooping until I'm in high school.
the cafeteria, possibly the cruelest place on Earth.
but I was about to make some kid's day by sitting next to him.
that seat's saved.
for who?
it's saved.
that one's saved, too.
so not happening.
taken.
where are we supposed to eat?
I guess this is where all the cool guys hang out.
Fregley must have bumped his head when he was little, like, really hard.
okay, okay, so my first day could have gone better, but at least I wasn't humiliated.
Hey, Greg! You want to come over and play?
what did he just say to you?
I think my ride's here.
Hey, guys. So this guy says to that guy, "You wanna come over and play"?
Yeah! Do you guys wanna play with us?
see? This is the problem.
right now I have to take abuse from these morons.
but in 20 years, Quentin here will be working for me.
Greg, please don't fire me.
I really need my measly, pathetic job scooping your dog's poop.
whatever. I'll think about it.
no, no, no. Vanilla on the bottom and chocolate on the top!
I can't eat this!
"play," Rowley? "Play"?
I've told you, like, a billion times that guys our age say "hang out," not "play."
Oops.
seriously, if you're not gonna listen to me, just tell me, 'cause if you pull another stunt like that, we'll be stuck on the cafeteria floor for the rest of middle school.
I found half a Snickers bar down there.
I can't be the guy who eats off his lap in the cafeteria.
I should be at the top of the food chain by now.
something's got to change, fast.
my mom told me to just be myself and people would like me.
that would be good advice if you were somebody else.
Hey, little brother.
was your first day as crappy as I said it would be?
no. Not at all. You were wrong.
it was actually better than I...Worse.
you didn't listen to me, did you?
I told you not to talk, look or go anywhere, and what happened?
he had to eat his lunch on the floor.
Rowley. Perfect.
and if nobody wants you sitting at their table, you think they want Chummy Buttons over here?
I was right. You're not even gonna make it out of there alive.
the only chance you have of making the yearbook is when they dedicate it to your memory.
so you wanna play Twisted Wizard?
no. I have a better idea.
if he catches you in here, he will kill you.
literally, kill you.
don't worry. As long as we hear the music, we're okay.
I didn't know Rodrick was into motorcycles.
I found it. Found what?
Rodrick's middle school yearbook.
this thing holds all the answers.
Rowley, this thing is like a bible.
see this? This is where a person like me needs to be.
the class favorites.
they're the best in their class.
these people aren't nobodies. They're famous.
they don't have to worry about getting a seat in the cafeteria, either.
check this out. There's tons of things I qualify for.
most Likely "To Succeed," "Best Looking," "Class Clown."
they should just give that to me right now.
don't you have to be funny for that?
Hey! We could try for cutest friends!
what did I tell you would happen if you ever went in my room again?
but your band is still playing.
it's the bass solo, Turd Burglar! Don't you know anything about music?
now, I came up here to get a new drumstick, and now, Greg, since Mom and Dad are gone,
I'm going to kill you. Literally, kill you!
I told you.
beat it.
okay, but I just want to say one thing!
run, Greg, run! What?
let go, Baby Hippo!
you're gonna have to come out sometime, loser!
I'll wait here as long as it takes.
and then, you're dead.
time out, Rodrick. I have to pee.
no time outs. Only death!
but I really have to go. Don't care.
move over! I'm dying.
got you!
Greg, did you throw Manny off his...
what is going on?
Greg started it. I just came in here to take a shower.
he's lying! He was gonna kill me 'cause I was in his room!
and so you peed on him?
Yes. I mean, no. I mean...
Yes.
wow, there's a lot to sign up for.
you could be class favorite in a bunch of things.
jazz dancing!
we could do that one together!
I can't believe all these activities. They're all so much work.
staying after school, meeting before school, on weekends.
what kind of extracurricular activities are these?
out of my way.
who let you into this school, Greg Heffley?
I was thinking the same thing about you, Patty Farrell.
you listen to me, Greg Heffley.
I'm running for student council president and I'm warning you, if you get in my way, I will beat you up, just like I did in kindergarten and fourth grade.
fourth grade? That one was ugly.
what's her problem? What did I ever do to her?
Patty, Patty is a fatty, has a face just like a ratty!
come on, that was pretty funny. She needs to get a sense of humor.
and I need something to make me a class favorite.
what about class favorites?
don't you ever say hi or hello before you start talking?
Hi. Hello.
Oh, Greg's only here because he really wants to be something...
Rowley!
I was just saying that I would really like to nail these people because it's so obvious that they're only doing these activities to get in the yearbook.
you know, I like your point of view.
you should sign up for the school paper. We're the voice of the people.
well, the people are mostly idiots, so I guess, technically speaking, we're the voice of the people making fun of the people.
Thanks, but I can't be on the paper because I'm gonna be in the paper a lot.
so that would be a conflict of interest.
you're the people. Got it.
do you believe me now? That girl is crazy town.
look! They have wrestling!
that's it! I'm great at wrestling.
I've watched it for years, I know all the moves.
tombstone pile driver.
chair shot.
vader Bomb.
Heffley! Heffley! Heffley! Heffley!
Heffley! Heffley! Heffley!
okay. Something is very wrong here.
these don't look like wrestling costumes to me.
welcome to wrestling, you future Olympians!
so, just to make sure we all get off on the right foot and nobody gets seriously injured, we're gonna teach you a few basic moves.
remember, this is about learning the sport and having fun!
all right. It's not a competition because everyone here is already a superstar to me.
coach Brewer, can you step over here for a moment, please, give me a hand? Thanks.
that's known as a speed takedown.
nice job, Coach Brewer.
can you get up and come behind me?
put one arm over my shoulder? Let's go, yeah.
you got it, walk it off, come on.
that was known as the arm drag.
let's give Coach Brewer a hand, everybody!
he's fine.
Yeah, Heffley.
what about pile drivers and Vader bombs?
that is fake wrestling.
this is real wrestling! Let's go!
if I have to wrestle Benny Wells, he'll kill me!
let's move! Come on!
okay, to keep things fair,
I've divided you into weight categories by your size, so Rottweilers over here.
bulldogs, you stay right there.
and we got two
chihuahuas. Yeah.
nice head gear.
Thanks. My mom let me borrow it.
all right, let's see what you got.
don't worry, Fregley, I'll take it easy on you.
Hey, I wasn't ready!
nobody's keeping score, but that was a sweet speed takedown, Fregley!
this is fun, Greg Heffley!
get off me!
Fregley! Fregley! Fregley!
blow the whistle, blow the whistle!
all right! Fregley!
Outstanding!
and let's...Let's hear it for our other winner.
yay, Greg!
I can't lose to Fregley again.
if I get beat by the weirdest kid in school, nobody's ever gonna let me sit at their table.
how are you going to beat him? It's like he had superhuman strength!
I'm not gonna beat him. I'm gonna gain 10 pounds this week so I can move up to the Bulldog weight class.
and then you and I can wrestle each other.
ready?
can I throw at you now? Later.
you're better at riding than I am, and I'm a better thrower.
Greg, save some for everybody else, honey.
can't. I need to bulk up.
Why?
I think your body looks beautiful just the way it is.
I heard he got his butt kicked at wrestling.
now what is wrong with you?
why would you sign up for something you don't have to do?
you signed up for wrestling?
kind of.
you never sign up for anything at school.
you fly below the radar.
that way you never raise anyone's expectations.
thank you, Rodrick, for those words of motivational wisdom, but perhaps a better way to look at it is that it's a chance to learn to excel at something.
well, what could I learn at school that I can't teach myself?
well, Greg, I think it's great that you took the initiative to learn something new.
this is like the first step to responsibility!
my boss's son Will was smaller than you, but he built himself up with the weights!
Yeah. We could get you the same equipment.
you could train, get the right nutrition, cardio.
you'd be in tip-top shape just like Will.
and it would only take, like, three months.
three months? Yeah.
I'll just stick to eating.
well, I don't know where you put it, Heffley, but you gained 10 pounds and joined the Bulldog class.
Yes.
I thought you didn't gain any weight this week.
my mom's ankle weights.
all right, bulldog Heffley. Meet your new opponent.
what? But this is boys' wrestling.
ever hear of Title IX?
her parents threatened to sue, so you show her what it's like to wrestle a real live boy.
come on! What you waiting for, huh? Don't be such a wuss, Heffley.
make your move! She's a girl! Where do I grab her?
stay down! Patty, over here!
get off of me! Can I wrestle somebody good now?
a GREAT DAY FOR WOMEN
well, look who's in the paper.
Greg! You're famous! Right on the front page!
and if I would have pinned her, which I could have done easily, you know I would have gotten in trouble for hurting a girl.
why does she even want to wrestle?
who knows? Girls are very confusing.
like today, I heard someone in the hallway say that Bryce Anderson has a cute butt. What does that even mean?
a butt can't be cute. It's a butt.
I know, but that's what they were saying.
I don't see why girls our age can't talk just like regular people.
so how are you gonna become a class favorite now?
two words. Best Dressed. How are you going to do that?
fashion is easy.
you wear a shirt and a tie, and kids are impressed.
I'm telling you, this is gonna work.
I light 'em up before the motor starts. I go so fast that I could never stop. Look under the hood but you don't know what I got. I'm a moving violation, baby hot, hot, hot, hot.
I told you I was wearing this. I know!
I wanted to be matchers! Check them out!
Greg and Rowley sitting in a tree
Kl-S-S-l-N-G
first comes love...
you know, maybe Rodrick was right about Rowley.
maybe I do need a new best friend.
but I can't just ditch him.
I mean, if anybody has a better idea, I'd love to hear it.
it's AWESOME TO BE ME
in this school, much like your own, one boy is about to learn an important lesson about self-worth and esteem.
gag me with a spoon.
that guy is so unpopular, I'd hate to be him.
why doesn't anybody like me?
maybe because they don't know how awesome you really are.
Brock Branigan P. I! What are you doing here?
I'm here to solve the case of the boy who just needed to be himself.
so go for it! Show them how awesome you really are!
Hey, guys. Do you like break dancing?
that is totally rad!
wicked. You should sit with us at lunch, friend.
sweet!
it really is awesome to be me! Thanks, Brock.
awesome!
okay. Let's talk about what we've learned.
I don't know about anyone else, but I know what I learned.
it is awesome to be me.
the problem with Rowley is that he's not enough like me.
I can't ditch him 'cause he'd be lost without me.
but maybe I can fix him.
because that's the kind of friend I am.
what are you doing?
making your clothes more middle-school friendly.
look at this stuff. Too babyish and weird.
too "Why don't you just punch me now"?
what are you, a foreign exchange student?
Oh, man. This one we burn.
that was a present from my mom.
well, then your mom is trying to get you killed.
ready? Steady. Go.
no, no, no. You look like one of the Seven Dwarfs.
you only need one strap. One strap is cool.
but there's two straps.
why would they put on two straps if you're only supposed to use one?
because the guys who make backpacks aren't cool.
if they were cool, they'd give it one strap, like the cool one-strap guys do.
you know what has one strap? Machine guns.
you know what else? Electric guitars.
you know what else? Purses?
but Joshie is cool. Rowley, Joshie is not cool.
he's a lip-synching pop star whose fans are eight-year-old girls.
you're just jealous that I was the one who discovered him.
who are you gonna listen to, Rowley? Me or Joshie?
Joshie says to respect your parents and follow your dreams.
then Joshie must get beaten up a lot.
you actually almost look as good as me.
am I great at this or what?
there's Bryce Anderson. Just be cool.
Hey, Bryce. Yeah, hey, Bryce!
cute butt!
you're killing me, you know that?
look, Rowley, tonight's Halloween, our favorite night of the year, so, just promise me you won't wear, do or say anything weird.
you're kidding me, right?
my mom wanted me to be visible at night.
from space?
so, we'll hit a few houses on the way to the North Side, which is where we'll do most of our trick-or-treating.
why are we going all the way over there?
it's where the rich people live.
they hand out, like, two, three pieces of big candy to each kid.
not that candy corn crap.
I'm talking about full-size Milky Ways and Nutter Butters.
Plus, if we time it right, rich people get tired of answering their doors and just leave the bowl out.
we can clean up.
wow, you're lucky.
my mom doesn't let me play with makeup anymore.
shut up, tool. Loded Diper's got a gig tonight.
Mmm.
going to the North Side, huh?
takes you right past the Devil Worshiper Woods.
the Devil Worshiper Woods?
you know about that story, right?
well, there used to be this house right here where these woods are.
they had to tear it down because what happened there was so terrible.
what happened there?
well, a long time ago, two kids who were, I don't know, maybe in middle school, they trick-or-treated at that house on Halloween night.
but the house was full of devil worshipers who put the kids in these giant pizza ovens.
and they cooked them and they ate them.
but they forgot to turn off the ovens.
so the house burned down with everyone in it.
how'd the trees get there?
and then they planted trees.
Oh.
and to this day, on Halloween night, you can still hear the demonic laughter of the devil worshiper ghosts as they roam the woods, looking for more kids to sacrifice!
Hey, Rodrick. I need you to help me out. Like...
are you wearing eyeliner?
trick or treat. Susan!
I'm on door duty! Thank you.
Bubby!
mom, can you tell him to stop calling me that?
what if somebody hears?
then they'll know how much he loves you.
Frank, Frank, honey, honey, can you go with them?
no, I can't. I got to guard the house in case someone tries to T. P. Us.
they're gonna get drenched from the roof.
honey, for goodness sakes, don't do that again.
remember what happened last year?
I got you!
Hi.
I thought they were teenagers.
and I couldn't see through the bushes.
my legs, they hurt from the squatting.
so, that's why I'm doing it from the roof this year.
so I can see when they're coming.
can we go now?
Yes, go.
but stay in the neighborhood. Trick or treat.
and no North Side! We promise!
we got to stay in this neighborhood the rest of the night.
that guy gave me two full-size Snickers!
did I tell you or did I tell you? These people have money to burn!
I can't believe we got this much candy.
this is, like, the best day ever.
Hey, reflector dude, nice costume!
Thanks! My mom made it...
Oh, that was awesome! I saw your plates! We're calling the cops!
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy.
run!
Hey, they're going through the yard!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
where are we going? We're totally exposed!
my grandma's house! Quickly!
they're coming!
Hello? That's not helping! She's not home!
bingo night. Okay, you guys are dead.
open the door! Get the key! Okay. Okay.
open the door! Get it! Come on, let's get them, boys.
they're coming!
now! Oh, I got you now!
Hey, hey!
come on, you babies!
I'm gonna kick your butts!
yeah? You and what army? Whatever.
you guys are so lucky you can hide in there behind your mommy!
no, we aren't! It's not our house!
it's his grandma's and she's not even home!
what? Why would you tell them that?
did he just say that?
Oops.
now they're never gonna leave.
you need to call your mom to come get us.
mine'll kill me if she knows we're here.
mine will, too. She thinks you're a bad influence.
she's right.
then we're gonna have to bust out of here.
you have any threes? Go fish.
Hey, what's that?
danger, danger. High Voltage. Danger, danger. High Voltage.
just back off! I don't want to hurt anybody, we just want to walk away and forget this ever happened.
nobody needs to be a hero! Whoa!
are you kidding me?
I'm gonna rip off your arms and punch you in the face with your own fists!
they're gaining! This way!
the Devil Worshiper Woods! No way!
Hey! Stay right there! We're gonna get you!
they're going into the woods.
no, no way I go into Devil Worshiper Woods. Uh-uh.
this isn't over!
I'm really scared! Just keep running!
did you hear that? It's the devil worshipers.
guys?
are we safe? Yeah.
and we made it with still a ton of candy.
sorry. I was...I thought you were teenagers.
maybe next year, Pops! Hey!
so anyone else exhibiting symptoms of pink eye should contact the nurse immediately.
in field trip news, consent forms are going out today for our annual History of Plumbing excursion.
in sports news...
I think Shelly is looking Hot today.
Yeah. Are they talking about me?
I don't know. I don't speak Russian.
and finally, some positions have opened up for the Safety Patrol.
if anyone is interested, see Mr. Winsky after homeroom.
now that's what I'm talking about.
safety Patrol. The cops of middle school.
you boss people around, report the jerks, and miss class three times a week.
safety Patrol is a sacred trust.
when you put on this vest and that badge you become a protector of the weak.
you become an enforcer of the laws of this school, because today's litterer and jaywalker is tomorrow's window breaker and graffiti vandal, and it's our job to stop it.
so I ask you, are you up for the job?
Yes! Yes!
then welcome to Safety Patrol.
just remember, with great power...
Whoa...comes great responsibility.
now, you get your first assignment just after lunch, so you'll be excused from the first 20 minutes of sixth period.
but that means we'll miss Algebra...Ouch!
do we get free stuff?
free hot cocoa. Could this day get any better?
whoa, is that cocoa?
sorry, Safety Patrol only. Sorry.
you rejected the school paper, but you joined the Safety Patrol?
look, are you working your way down the evolutionary ladder?
what?
look, Safety Patrol is the lowest of the low, the geekiest of the geeky, the Island of Misfit Toys.
you're just jealous they don't trust you to keep our school safe.
now if you'll excuse me, I need to secure the perimeter.
I'm hungry. Keep it straight, people.
single-file line, one by one.
Greg! It's those guys from Halloween!
what do we do?
come on, man, just pull my finger.
I swear to God, I'm not gonna do anything.
everybody, shoulder to shoulder. Shoulder to shoulder.
go. Go! Whoa, whoa.
that was close. Too close.
it's times like these that make me realize
Rowley's pretty lucky to have me as a friend.
and I got Twisted Wizard Two, and a new bike!
and we're going to take a family trip to New York City for New Year's Eve!
what did you get? My dad got me a weight-lifting set.
do you know how many video games I could've gotten instead?
I had to get out of there before he expected me to, like, use it.
anyway, let's play some Twisted Wizard Two at your house.
probably not a good idea. My dad's still annoyed at you.
for what?
remember that secret language we made up last week?
Your-pa dad-pa smells-pa like-pa a woman-pa.
I think he cracked our code.
we should probably do something outside.
why can't you ride and I throw at you first?
my legs kind of hurt from walking over here.
okay, Rowley. Come on. Get up.
shake it off.
are you sure the doctor was right?
it really didn't look that broken to me.
Yeah, it's broken. The X-ray never lies.
Oh, my gosh. What happened? I broke it.
how? Big Wheel accident.
you're funny.
can I sign your cast? Me, too.
I wanna sign it, too. Why, sure.
Hey, I'm the one who broke his hand.
then you're a jerk.
sorry. Does it hurt?
Rowley, you're so funny.
after I stood...I couldn't believe it!
Rowley was eating at an actual table because of something I did!
Where's my credit?
and he's right handed! He can feed himself just fine.
so, how's that class favorite thing working out for you?
great.
I realized Rowley's injury thing was a pretty good racket.
it's gonna be so much fun. Hey, guys. Check it out.
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
it's a raging infection caused by a splinter that was left untreated.
want to be the first to sign my sympathy sheet?
no.
I'll sign it, Greg Heffley, if you'd let me look at your infection.
and on the X-ray, you could see where the bone just snapped right in half.
I had the exact same break last year, and it got all purple!
cool! Mine, too! Hey, Gregory, want to sign the card?
you got Rowley a card?
what? No, it's for Bryan Little.
you know, the guy who writes the Wacky Dawg cartoons for the school paper?
he has mono and he's going to be out for three months.
that really stinks.
so, just out of curiosity, who's gonna do the cartoon?
they're having tryouts, but the important thing is Bryan gets better.
Absolutely.
Bryan Little getting mono was destiny.
I draw cartoons all the time. I'm gonna win this.
I decided to go ahead and forgive Rowley for milking the broken hand so hard and I told him he could work on the cartoon with me.
so, I was thinking we could do something like this!
Oops, I stepped in a puddle!
at least it's not an acid puddle.
oy, oy, oy! It is an acid puddle!
Zoo-wee Mama!
Zoo-wee Mama!
it's the same joke every time.
Yeah! Zoo-wee Mama!
we can't just do the same thing over and over.
we can if it's "Zoo-wee Mama."
it has to be a little more sophisticated.
I wonder what is in this cute little box.
it's not a box, it's a brick, you dumb moron.
oops! I've been trying to open it all day!
can he say, "Zoo-wee Mama"?
no, it's not funny.
well, I think it is. I like "Zoo-wee Mama."
you know what?
if you like it so much, then why don't you go do it yourself?
okay. I will.
see you.
Hey, I forgot my raincoat, so I'm gonna need you to walk the kids home today.
I can't. I can't get my cast wet. You can borrow my coat.
Where's Rowley?
he couldn't get his cast wet! He walks us better!
Oh, no.
Oh, my gosh! Space monsters!
they're going to eat us, unless we can get into that hole!
come on, people, move it! Now, people! We're gonna get eaten!
come on! Don't worry! I'm right behind you!
Whoa! Go!
Hey!
Rowley Jefferson, is that you?
Yes, Mrs. Irvine!
sorry, kids!
are you going to eat us?
and though doctors assure us that
Mrs. Cheznik is no longer contagious, the cafeteria nachos bar will be closed for the remainder of the week.
and now, what you've all been waiting for.
the faculty, Student Council and editors have all met and selected the new cartoonist for the school paper.
and the winner is "Zoo-wee Mama" by Rowley Jefferson!
what? That is funny!
great job.
Zoo-wee Mama. I couldn't believe it.
am I the only one who gets comedy?
Rowley, will you put me in your cartoon? Sure.
and me, too. I want to be the one who says, "Zoo-wee Mama."
you got it! Hey, Rowley, congratulations.
Thanks. No problem.
you know, I read all the submissions and yours was by far the best.
I read yours, too.
Hey, Rowley. Hey, Bryce.
Yeah, hey, Bryce. Hey, fella.
Wow. Everyone knows me now.
it's like I'm famous! Isn't this great? Yeah.
Rowley Jefferson? I need to see you in my office, now.
I just took a call from a Mrs. Irvine about what happened to the kindergarteners last week.
she was very upset. And so am I.
what? You violated the sacred trust.
this...
this badge is supposed to mean something, and you just spat on it.
I can barely even look at you.
I really don't... Just save it.
you are officially suspended from Safety Patrol.
and I expect a full apology to the kindergarteners.
Yes, sir.
Hey. What did he have to say? I'm kicked off.
I don't even know what he's talking about.
Rowley?
what? Nothing.
you've been home for an hour and haven't badgered me for any snacks.
are you feeling okay?
well, I'm kind of in a tough situation.
I know something and if I tell the truth about it, it could hurt somebody.
but if I don't, it could hurt somebody else.
well, you have to trust your gut and try to do the right thing, because it's our choices that make us who we are.
okay.
I was up all night, tossing and turning, thinking about my mom's advice.
and I finally decided to do the right thing.
I'm sorry I terrorized you, children.
what?
I decided to let Rowley take one for the team.
but I'm not entirely sure that was the right call.
Hey, how's it going?
well, I was pretty upset about being suspended from Safety Patrol, but then I just started drawing a bunch of "Zoo-wee Mamas" and I felt better.
look. I put you in this week's cartoon.
and you even get to say, "Zoo-wee Mama."
Wow. That's really nice.
so, listen.
it's kind of funny, you know, the whole Safety Patrol thing.
yeah?
ready for the funny part?
well, I'm the one who terrorized those kids!
what? Yeah, and I think we can both learn some valuable lessons from this.
like, I should be more careful what I do in front of Mrs. Irvine's house.
and you, well, you should be more careful who you lend your coat to.
you know what, Greg? You're not a good friend.
whoa. How could you even say that? I'm a great friend.
if you were a great friend, you would have told Mr. Winsky the truth.
okay, one thing. You can't get mad about just...
you only care about yourself.
you hated my cartoon.
you made fun of my clothes. You disrespected Joshie.
you broke my hand and you didn't even seem sorry.
that broken hand was the best thing that ever happened to you!
don't call me.
don't come by my house. We're done.
I thought the whole thing would blow over.
but Rowley was still giving me the silent treatment.
even when I tried to make the first move.
so, anyway,
I was so angry at him, I didn't know what to say.
one of the kindergarteners finally told their parents the whole story.
Greg? You're relieved of your Safety Patrol duties, effective immediately.
Rowley, for showing dignity under false suspicion,
I am promoting you to team captain.
now, that's a position that I held for two years.
I know you'll honor it.
okay. You're supposed to be my friend. We're supposed to get along. Hey, you're supposed to be my friend.
Hey, Rowley, my mom says it's okay for me to sleep over tonight.
awesome!
the whole thing with Rowley is,
I was willing to let bygones be bygones.
but then he made friends with Collin just to mess with me.
as if I even care if he...
well, you know what?
two can play at that game.
there's no going back, Sergeant. I need to board the helicopter.
do you have my back?
I will always have your back, Captain.
Yeah, maybe I'll meet up with some friends. Yeah, maybe I'll meet up with some dogs 'Cause you're supposed to be You're supposed to be Supposed to be my friend You're supposed to be my friend now
Hey. Hey, Greg Heffley.
so, I was thinking maybe you might want to have a sleepover?
Yeah. With who?
me.
Yeah, when? Now.
Greg Heffley, I love you!
we are going to be best friends forever!
wanna have a tickle fight?
okay. Let's get inside.
I can't believe it!
Greg Heffley's in my room!
Greg Heffley's in my room, Rebecca.
what do you want to do, Greg Heffley? How about Twister?
I'm not really that much of a Twister guy.
candy! Wait!
no, no, no! Fregley, come on! Really!
I really think we should save those for later!
maybe we should go outside and...
my mom doesn't let me have sugar.
she says high glucose in my diet induces hyperactivity.
but it's so good!
Greg Heffley, you want to jumpety-jump?
Yeah, you know what, Fregley? I just remembered,
I have an appointment, a really important appointment.
it's a homework appointment. Yeah, and I really should be going.
get away from me!
I can fly! Whoa.
how fun, Greg Heffley!
Greg? Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg? Greg? Greg?
I hear you breathing, Greg Heffley.
dear Gregory,
I'm very sorry I chased you with a booger on my finger.
here, I put it on this paper so you can get me back.
what?
all right.
okay, enough. I'll show Rowley I don't need him.
when he sees me in the yearbook as Most Talented, he's gonna come running back.
okay, since there are so many of you here auditioning, to save time, we're gonna do a group sing of one of my favorite songs.
please refer to the lyrics on this handout.
I will pick out the best voices and place you accordingly.
Greg Heffley, what a lovely soprano voice you have. I'm stunned!
maybe you should be Dorothy!
no, no, I can't be... No!
Greg Heffley was suspended from the school Safety Patrol!
how can you trust him with the lead role in the play?
he can't be Dorothy! I'm Dorothy!
all right, Patty, calm down. I'm Dorothy! I am!
my mother is the president of the P.T.A.
she can ruin your life!
just an idea.
all right, well, Greg, your voice is too high for any of the other male roles.
perhaps you can be a tree!
a tree? No way.
the trees get to throw apples at Patty Farrell.
haven't you seen the movie?
wait, we don't get arm holes?
how are we gonna throw apples at Dorothy without arm holes?
you don't need arm holes because nobody's throwing any apples.
we're not doing the movie. In my version, the trees sing.
these, my dear.
down the winding yellow road Doth she know to where it goes With her dog so small and true We hope she fares well Yes, we do
my tooth! I think I knocked out my tooth!
perhaps we should cut out some arm holes.
is he okay? You think?
isn't this exciting? Your son's in a play.
Yeah, sure. It's not wrestling, but...
but at least it's something. Come on, Toto.
let us explore this magical path!
Bubby!
Bubby! Bubby!
bubby.
Hey, Bubby, I think you dropped an apple.
huh?
we three trees from yonder glen. Do spy a fair and sweet maiden. Whilst we're rooted to our spots. In silver slippers she doth trot down the winding yellow road. Oh, yes.
doth she know to where it goes.
you're dead.
with her dog so small and true. We hope she fares well. Yes, we do. We three trees from...
from yonder glen!
wish her joy through journey's end!
sing!
sing!
sing! This bites!
come on, Greg Heffley!
stop ruining the play like you ruin everything else!
don't make me come over there and beat you up again!
eat this!
eat this!
Wow.
What'd you think? I thought he was the best one up there.
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. You know, I'm...
I thought Dorothy deserved it.
Thanks, Dad.
you got some good shots in there.
look what I found in the trash.
guess you threw it away by accident.
give it back, Rodrick!
no way! You want it?
come and get it then! Come on.
give it! Come on!
use your muscular legs! No, you can't have it.
okay, okay, boys! Give it back!
hold on, don't you want it? Okay!
it's for you.
it's an invitation for the Mother and Son Sweetheart Dance.
I knew you didn't want to miss that.
it looks like a lot of fun.
I think you should go. I think it'd be a lot of fun.
fun? That's the exact opposite of fun!
this entire year has been terrible and nobody even cares!
my family, my best friend.
well, I'm sick of it. Somebody needs to pay.
okay, Manny, I'm putting this Tootsie Roll in Rodrick's backpack.
it's for Rodrick, so whatever you do, don't touch the Tootsie Roll.
Mmm-hmm.
Greg? Coaster. Where's he...
Manny? Where did you get that?
Oh, my. That's offensive.
Rodrick? Rodrick!
I need to talk to you inside! Now!
go ahead and talk. We're a band and we have no secrets.
okay, fine. What is this?
it's not mine. It was in your backpack.
no, it was in my room.
does owning this magazine make you a better person?
no. Did it make you more popular at school?
Yes!
no.
how do you feel about having owned this type of magazine?
ashamed! Nice.
hmm.
do you have anything you wanna say to women for having owned this offensive magazine?
I'm sorry, women.
Yeah, women. Yeah.
you're grounded for two weeks.
okay, settle down, Susan! I think one week is plenty!
make it four weeks and I'm gonna need the keys to your van!
my van?
Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
all right, smile.
look at this place! Wanna dance?
mom, stop dancing. You're embarrassing me.
come on. I'm just keeping time to the music.
I'm begging you, please stop it.
okay, okay, okay.
Thanks, honey.
Hi!
well, if we're not here to dance, maybe you should go talk to Rowley.
I think it's time you two made up.
I can't.
sweetheart, he's your best friend.
and sometimes, when somebody's worth it, you just have to put yourself out there.
I wouldn't know what to say.
well, I could go for an ice cream after the dance.
maybe you could invite him to join us.
Yeah.
Hey, Rowley.
Hey.
so you want to go get some ice cream after?
I'm sorry. We already have plans.
Yeah. We do.
Oh, fine. My mom wanted me to ask. So I did.
I didn't even want to go.
well?
honey, I'm sorry.
Yeah!
well, now, don't you tell me to smile. You stick around, I'll make it worth your while. Got numbers beyond what you can dial. Maybe it's because I'm so versatile. Style profile, I said. It always brings me back when I hear, Ooh, child From the Hudson River out to the Nile. I run the marathon till the very last mile. If you battle me I will revile. People always say my style is wild. You've got gall, you've got guile. To step to me, I'm a rapophile. If you want to battle, you're in denial. Coming from Uranus to check my style. Go ahead, put my rhymes on trial. Cast you off into exile.
you have got to be kidding me.
Hey, what's up? Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
so, I left my racing game at your house and Collin's sleeping over tonight.
so I need it back.
what? No way.
finders, keepers.
you didn't find it, I left it.
fine, then leavers, losers.
that's not even a real thing.
it is if I say it is.
it's my game.
do you know what?
you wouldn't even have that game if I hadn't told you about it.
you wouldn't have half the stuff you have without me.
Yeah, like a broken hand!
that was a million years ago.
it clicks now!
hear that? Click, click, click, click.
and it's all your fault!
it was an accident!
kick his butt, Rowley! It's easy.
guys, Greg and Rowley are gonna fight.
fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
come on, what's wrong with you guys? Start punching!
you start. You start it.
no, you!
quit copying me!
this has got to be the worst fight ever! Do something!
well, well, well. Look who we have here.
you're so freaking dead.
all you guys better scram or I'm gonna kick your butts, too!
not you two.
you guys have no idea what I'm gonna do to you.
Oh, um...
what are we gonna do?
I don't know. We need to move this along.
my shift at Cinnabon starts in half an hour.
I know what we're gonna do. Give me the wide one.
that's you, let's go.
pick it up.
but... Pick it up.
now eat it.
No!
eat it or I'll shove the entire thing down your throat.
I don't even want to say exactly what happened because if Rowley ever tries to run for President and someone finds out what these guys made him do, he won't have a chance.
now you.
but I'm allergic to dairy!
I'll die, and then you'll go to jail! And...
Hey!
what are you doing on school property? Go, go, go!
shotgun!
Pete Hosey, is that you?
you boys okay? Yeah? All right.
out of my way! Out of my way!
Oh, my God. Rowley Jefferson ate...
I ate the cheese!
Yeah. I ate it.
and you know what, people? I just did you all a huge favor.
I ate the cheese to show you all how stupid this whole school is.
the wrong friends.
the wrong lunch table.
the wrong butt?
it's all meaningless.
just like this cheese.
I know it. You all know it.
so come on.
everyone else who's sick of it, step forward and join me!
cheese Touch! Greg Heffley has the Cheese Touch!
run! He's got the Cheese Touch!
not bad, Heffley. Not bad at all.
so you want to come over after school and play?
Yeah.
okay.
here's your yearbook. Have a great summer.
here's your yearbook. Have a great summer.
Thanks!
here's your yearbook. Have a great summer.
Thanks, Patty.
here's your yearbook. You're not in it that much.
maybe try to get out there a little next year.
you know what, Patty?
one day middle school will end and become high school.
and after that, it just becomes life.
and all those things you think are important now won't be anymore.
you wish.
as if!
handing it to you is like touching you and I am way too smart to touch somebody who ate the cheese.
Rowley! Have a great summer!
stay cool.
Yep, you're way too smart for me, Patty Farrell.
so the year turned out pretty good.
my goal was to be a class favorite, and I made it.
even if it wasn't exactly the way I planned it.
Zoo-wee Mama!
cutest FRIENDS I don't wanna waste my time again. By getting wasted with so-called friends, 'Cause they don't know me. But they pretend to be part of my social scenery. Hey, maybe I'm a critic, a cynic. Or am I jaded or am I afraid of it?
cause it's dragging me down. It's bumming me out. It's making my head spin round and round. Can you say, "Hey"?
can you say, "Oh"?
that's right, what do you want from me?
can you say, "Hey"?
can you say, "Oh"?
that's right, what do you want from me?
I get the feeling we're on to something.
I say jump and you start jumping. Can you say, "Hey?
can you say, "Oh?
that's right, what do you want from me?
just another day in the life of me. It's three AM and I can't sleep.
maybe I'm a critic, a cynic. Or am I crazy? Do they all hate me?
cause they pick me up and throw me down. It's making my head spin round and round. Can you say, "Hey"?
can you say, "Oh"?
that's right, what do you want from me?
can you say, "Hey"?
can you say, "Oh"?
that's right, what do you want from me?
I get the feeling, we're on to something. I say jump and you start jumping. Can you say, "Hey"?
can you say, "Oh"?
that's right, now what do you want from me?
can you say, "Hey"?
can you say, "Oh"?
that's right, what do you want from me?
can you say, "Hey"?
can you say, "Oh"?
that's right, what do you want from me?
I get the feeling, we're on to something. I say jump and you start jumping. Can you say, "Hey"?
can you say, "Oh"?
that's right, what do you want from me?
all units, all units. Code 3 pursuit of 2- 11.
white SUV heading east on Alameda service road.
suspects: Three Asian males.
be advised. Shots fired, shots fired.
Hancock!
what, boy?
bad guys.
what, you want a cookie? Get out of my face.
asshole.
what? - You heard me.
asshole.
watch out!
Damn!
damn it!
Hancock!?!
beat it, 'Soulja Boy! '
he smells like a bar!
you pay for new roof!
fellas, hey. I don't give a shit what you did. I don't care.
three guys in the car, no girls, rave music.
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.
but if you don't pull over and give yourselves up quietly...
...I swear to Christ, your head is going up the driver's ass.
his head is going up your ass. And you drew the short stick...
...because your head is going up my ass.
shoot this asshole!
stop!
what? I'm not Japanese, man!
put us down!
Oh, now you "speaky Engly" huh? "Speaky Engly" now?
you broke my glasses.
I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!
put us down! - You want down?
Yes, please! Please! - Help me!
I'm real good at down. I'm real good at down.
all right? All right.
this, Hancock's latest act of so-called heroics...
...Took a hefty financial toll.
initial damage estimates are said to top $9 million...
...Which, if accurate...
...Represents a personal record for the notoriously publicity-shy Hancock...
...Who, as usual, can't be reached for comment.
with all the cracks to the concrete, all the bullets, water damage, fires...
...L. A. would be better off if this guy would leave and let us get on with our jobs.
Hi.
don't think I'm crazy, okay? We've looked everywhere for you.
going to the Roxy and the Viper Room and Jumbo's...
...Anywhere we thought you would be at. I found you.
I got you.
so, what's it like when you fly?
no, what? - I ain't gonna fly you.
I got a cousin, Narelle. She's my best friend in the entire world...
...and I swear to God she would not be here today if it wasn't for you.
she crashed her car up in Malibu and you flew her to the hospital.
remember?
I will break my foot off in your ass, woman.
you got a car?
Hey, want a drink?
so this is where you live. This is your hideout.
your Batcave.
your Fortress of Solitude.
it's a couple trailers I stuck together. - What's all this?
jiffy Pop. - Jiffy Pop.
what do you do with it? - Pop it.
jiffy Pop, pop. I like that.
hold on.
want me to give you something else to pop?
I didn't catch your name. - Pop this, Superman.
not much for the chitchat, huh? Let me set this over here.
all right. Now, there are some rules. - Hello?
no, I know, I haven't seen it yet. - Excuse me.
I know, probably. All right, all right.
let me call you back. - Listen.
you're gonna need to focus. All right, I need you...
Hey, that's... That's not focusing. - What's in there?
okay, all right, hold on. Stop. Stop it. All right, now...
...when I get to the moment... - The moment?
you know, the... Start climbing the mountaintop, you know?
you know... All right? Yes. - Yeah.
you're gonna need to be as far away from that as possible.
far. That's hot. - No, that's not hot. It's not hot.
Oh, yeah. - Okay.
Hancock. Oh, yeah.
now you're doing too much. - Hancock.
Oh, mountaintop! Mountaintop!
mountaintop! Watch out!
sorry.
that's not fair to anybody.
thank you for being okay with that.
I know it's... - Can I use the bathroom, please?
Yeah. Hey, you...? You want some Jiffy Pop?
no, thanks. - It's straight back.
you all right? - Yeah.
Yeah, I was trying to tell you.
hey...
listen... You know, if you want I could fly you.
it's really beautiful, you know? Earth.
you could see the...
might have to get you a helmet, so your face doesn't tear off.
what do you think?
sir? Ray Embrey.
ray. - Pleasure.
ray's like the Bono of P. R.
well, actually, I think Bono is the Bono of P. R. but I do try.
well, let's see it.
okay. I'll get right into it. Good morning, everyone.
I'm here to talk to you about charitable giving.
okay? And we all know the way that works.
you give one, maybe two percent of your net cash...
and you get an armband or a ribbon or whatever. It's nowhere near enough.
and that's why we at Embrey Publicity would like to offer you...the All Heart symbol.
now, you would be among a very select group of corporate giants...
...to bear this logo on your product.
and what this would say to the public...
...is that your company, Pharmatopsis...
...has made a radical contribution to helping our world.
here's all you need to do to qualify.
your new TB drug, Mycodin?
we would like for you to give that product away for free.
did you say "free"? - I did.
only to those who need it.
only to those who without it would otherwise die.
as a concept, free is kind of up there with, you know, lethal side effects.
mandatory product recall. - Get indicted, go to jail.
get out, work at IHOP for the rest of your career.
understandable reaction. It's a radical concept.
but it is the brand that represents a fairer and better world.
the brand...
...that everyone is talking about.
who is "everyone"?
we do already have a sports franchise.
NFL? NBA? MLB? - Soccer.
MLS? Which team?
well, it's a local team. Encino Hurricanes.
it's my son's team.
anyway, we can save the world.
all right? Someone's just gotta go first.
what do you say?
are you a crackpot?
Hey, hon. You're probably at the store. I am on my way.
I think I made a connection.
not really.
listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming and l... Damn it.
and I want some meatballs, okay?
I need some Spaghetti Madness. I'll see you in about 20 minutes.
Hey! What is it, National Horn Day?
idiot.
Hey.
Hey. Hey!
move it. There's a train coming.
do you not hear that horn?
let's go! I got a train!
move it!
back your car up! There's a train! - I can't go anywhere. Get out!
son of a bitch!
fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle.
get out!
get off the track! Move!
let's get him out. - Get him out of there.
somebody help him. - You all right?
you sure?
Ah, shit. - I'm all right. I'm okay.
all of you people...
...Blocking the intersection...
...you're all idiots.
you threw the dude's car at her. And what's with the train?
why didn't you just go straight up in the air with the car?
you've obviously injured that poor woman.
she's right. She should sue you. - Yeah, she should sue you.
well, you should sue McDonald's because they fucked you up.
you're an asshole.
and I can smell that liquor on your breath.
because I've been drinking, bitch. - You're a drunk asshole!
you think you're such a hero. - Asshole!
you're nothing but an asshole. - We don't need you in this city.
some superhero you are! Fly off!
shut up!
don't you understand? I'm alive.
I get to go home and see my family. I should be dead right now, right here.
Yeah, he could've gone straight up. Obviously, you should've.
you know, and I was upside down for the train, but...
no. Thank you.
thank you very much, Hancock. Thank you.
thank you, Hancock.
you're not flying by the Valley, are you?
throw the ball!
Monte, one guy'll line up here, all right? Hike the ball.
this guy'll be right here and he says, "Hut"!
this guy'll drop back. Hut! Drop back. Chuck it.
great. Thank you.
nice aim. The driveway would've been better, but...
what's going on, Dad? - Hey, buddy.
daddy's had a little bit of a day. Look at you, huh?
I want you to meet somebody.
this guy here, dragging Daddy's car into the driveway.
who's this? - Hancock.
that's right. Hancock, this is my boy, Aaron.
ray, what happened to the car? - Oh, boy.
you would not have believed it.
I came this close to getting hit by a train. If it wasn't for that guy...
he saved my life. I mean... Hancock, this is my wife, Mary.
believe that? I almost kissed a train.
saw my whole life flash before my eyes.
he saved your life? - He sure did. Thank you.
Hey, you good? - I am good, yeah.
all right. Keep it off the tracks. - I will, definitely.
hang on a... One second.
Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food? - Yeah.
you like meatballs? - No.
aaron, sweetheart, he has to go and do...
I love meatballs.
who's so busy they can't have a meal?
and it's on us. Please.
I'm not even gonna take no for an answer. Get inside the house.
why do you have an eagle on your hat?
do you like eagles?
this guy's like a little talking machine, huh?
we don't have a lot of guests over here.
look at that, huh? Hon, is the heat on?
no? All right.
we started Spaghetti Madness about two years ago.
we do it every Thursday, and we have not missed a Thursday in...
ever. - Yeah.
ever? That's a long time. - Yes, sir.
a very long time. - That's some good meatballs, boy.
Aaron.
your mama's calling you. - Yes, Mom?
no. His name is Aaron.
Hey, Aaron, how was school today? - Fine.
yeah? No more problems with that bully, Michael?
Michel. But not like a girl's name. - Michel. No, no, I know.
it's French. - Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this...
Hancock? Michel is this neighborhood bully.
we've been trying to teach Aaron a little...
...About conflict resolution. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that? - That's exactly right.
well, just never turn that one, all right?
never let them punk you.
got it, Mr. Hancock. - Aaron, eat.
the way you deal with bullies, you take your right foot...
...Bring it right up and catch him in his little piss pump.
you don't have to do that, honey, okay? Seriously.
it's a good idea.
you aim straight and make sure he can't use that thing...
...for nothing but a flap to keep the dust out of his butt crack.
okay, please, just stop.
michel is not a man, okay?
he's a little boy. And his parents...happen to be going through a bad divorce. That's why he's acting up.
maybe you don't know this...
...but not everything in this world gets resolved with force.
not everything has to be bang... - I'm set.
...Scream, blood, more blood. - Baby, I got plenty. Angel! We're okay.
she watches so much news...
...that sometimes it gets to be a little too much.
you got a toilet? - Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge.
did he just take the whiskey bottle to the bathroom?
do you want him to kill us all?
thanks for coming on in. Good, right?
very, yeah. - Wanna say goodbye to him?
Bye, Hancock. - Hey, all right, little buddy.
are you okay? - It was a joke.
come on, Aaron. - Hey, sorry. I was just trying to...
he got it. She didn't get it.
I owe you. You gave me my life back today.
hear me out. I'd like to return the favor.
do you know what I do? I'm in public relations.
you know what that is? Of course you do. We're image consultants.
we change the way people see products, companies, people, that stuff.
listen, I see you on the news and I see you out there today...
...and it can't feel good that people, you know, hate you.
it's good to meet you, Ray. - No, I'm sorry.
but hear me out.
people... Don't get me wrong, they should love you. They really should.
I wanna deliver that for you. It's the least that I can do.
you know, you're a superhero.
kids should ask you for your autograph.
people should cheer you on the streets.
what the hell are you pricks looking at?
no, no, they're not... It's all right.
they're not pricks, they're just people.
but I want you to give me one short pitch, you know?
that's all I ask. Okay?
you use...
put it under here?
put it right there. Perfect.
e-mail me or whatever. You just fly on over, I don't know.
I want you to think about it.
just be careful when you go. Sleep on it, all right?
you get back to me?
I'll be right here. All right.
please don't stare, you guys. He's kind of one of us.
what about All Heart?
it's a nonstarter, babe, you know? I'm chasing windmills with that.
maybe I can't change the world but I can change this guy's life.
think about all the good he can do. - I think you're wasting your time.
you really hate him.
hate? I don't hate him, Ray. I don't even know the guy.
just look at the news. You can see what he does.
I think he just needs people to care, you know?
you see the good in everybody, Ray.
even sometimes when it's not there.
I have a feeling about this. Don't work with this guy.
I know this kind of guy. He breaks things.
Frankenstein
my bad. Everybody all right?
I'll go and get my mommy.
he is an asshole.
what's your name, boy? - Michel.
you know who I am? - My papa says you are an asshole.
well, that's not really a nice word to call a person, is it?
asshole? - Yeah.
because that could make someone very angry...
...And, you know, maybe hurt their feelings.
you behave like an asshole.
all right...
do you know Aaron?
wee, la petit asshole.
well, seems to be a pretty good kid.
just wanna ask you to lay off of him a little bit.
why, asshole?
you're gonna stop calling me that. - Asshole.
that's not my name. - Asshole.
call me a asshole...
...one more time.
asshole.
how about you, thickness?
goggles?
Hancock! You son of a gun, I knew you'd come.
ask Mary. I had a feeling.
I said, he heard me and he's ready for a change.
this is great. Did you do this? You come in a little hot?
I'll meet you in the house.
I know you don't drive, but... - Oh, damn it, Ray.
all right. You're all right. You're all right. You're all right.
Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead.
not okay. Okay? - He all right.
really not okay. This is some of the stuff we're gonna work on.
how do you think that conversation's gonna go down with his mom? Landing like that in the street's also on the uncool side.
no, that was already like that when I got here, Ray.
I live here. I know what the street's like.
we'll make those problems of the past.
I'm gonna teach you how to interface with the public.
Where's the wife? - Mary took Aaron to his soccer game.
Hancock, pulled some stuff up on YouTube.
surprisingly large amount of not-great stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.
what is this?
that's me trying to change the world.
unfortunately, not doing real well.
come on. Let's get to you.
this stuff was on YouTube.
everybody loves a Nutty Buddy, I get it, but this doesn't work, sir.
Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy. Back up, back up.
mom! Mom! Mom!
those are children.
we've been waiting a long time... - Get that camera out of my face.
you ever put out an apartment fire, Ray?
no, I haven't done that. I'm in P. R. - No. My ass was hot.
all right. How about this? This is Walter, the gray whale.
everybody remembers him stuck on the beach north of Zuma.
along comes Hancock.
Hancock!
I don't even remember that. - Yeah.
greenpeace does. Walter does.
this gets redundant after a while...
...but my basic diagnosis of your fundamental problem is...
do you wanna hear it? - No.
you're an asshole.
I know. I call it like I see it though.
it's not a crime to be an asshole but it's counterproductive.
but you are an asshole, don't you think?
be careful.
all right, how about this? I've been thinking about something.
this kind of goes to how you present yourself.
come on. Really? It's the middle of the day. What springs to mind...
...when you see this?
Homo.
what about that? - Homo in red.
norwegian homo. - I'll give you that.
let's move past the comics. Let's get into something a little deeper.
I think that deep down you behave badly because you're lonely.
I think deep down, you want people's acceptance.
come on, now. You save people's lives...
...and they reject you, and so you reject them back.
and it's a... And we're gonna switch that cycle.
we're gonna start fresh, start anew.
this is outstanding. If you turn some of this power into willpower...
and then he kicked it in. - Almost.
Hey, Hancock! We almost won.
Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs. I'm making lunch. Go change.
Hey, sweetheart.
have you been watching the news?
no, we've been working on... - Interfacing with the public.
this has been on all day. - That's very good.
the law is the law, Mr. Hancock, and you are not above it.
felony destruction of property...
...Amounting to tens of millions of dollars, theft, and now this.
from where I sit, I see a selfish, self-absorbed man...
...with a lot of muscle, but no regard for anyone but yourself.
Mr. Hancock, let me remind you.
you are not above the law.
you have failed to show at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.
anybody else would be held in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you.
you may be a superhero, but let me tell you this:
you're not nearly as strong as the U. S. Constitution.
bank on it, buddy.
we do not condone the t...
genius.
things just got real. This is exactly what we need.
there's a DA trying to figure out how to put you in jail.
bitch can try. - I say you go.
people take you for granted. Make people miss you.
people don't like you, Hancock. - I do.
two weeks, you know? The public will be clamoring for you.
when they do, we'll be ready.
worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and you just, you know, fly out of there.
what do you got to lose?
I apologize to the people of Los Angeles.
my behavior has been improper, and I accept the consequences.
I ask my fellow Angelenos...
...for their patience and understanding.
you're an asshole, Hancock!
asshole!
life here can be difficult for me.
after all, I'm the only one of my kind.
during my incarceration, I will be participating...
...in alcohol- and anger-management treatment.
you're a drunk bum!
you deserve better from me. I can be better. I will be better.
all right.
good morning, ladies. Welcome to your new home...
it is the duty of each of you to remember your inmate serial number.
turn to your right.
turn to your left.
okay, scumbags. Let's go.
give me the hand, playboy.
california STATE PRISON JOHN HANCOCK
I see you, punk!
