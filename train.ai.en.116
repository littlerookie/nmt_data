aar claimed bp was blocking its ambitions for tnk-bp, including by resisting its attempts to expand it outside russia.
aar declined to comment on rosneft's announcement.
aar does not have any interest in destroying rosneft's$ 16 billion deal with bp.
aar expressed formal interest in bp's stake last week and, given its aggressive record, the group is unlikely to surrender without a legal battle.
aar has expressed interest, but so has a russian state company, according to people close to the process, raising concern about a tightening of kremlin control over the oil industry in the world's largest energy producer.
aar's ceo, stan polovets, is naturally in the former camp: "the british lecture about the sanctity of contracts," he tuts. "For bp to flout it was not something we expected."
aar's opponents say this is incorrect, on both counts.
aar, which holds 50 per cent of tnk-bp, said it would take action against bp in a stockholm arbitration court to annul a framework agreement on the secondment of bp employees to the venture.
