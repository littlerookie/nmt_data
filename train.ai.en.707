deflation makes debts bigger in real, purchasing-power terms.
deflation may be theresult of government policy (such as a moveto raise interest rates and cut money supply) or can be caused by external factors, such asintense trade competition or the collapse ofan asset bubble.

deflation robs a central bank of its ability to stimulate spending using negative real interest rates.
deflation serves no benefit to the federal reserve, as declining prices spur positive-feedback panic selling and bank runs, and debt repayments in nominal terms under deflation cause real losses.
deflation was hard on farmers and borrowers, who longed for a little inflation to help them with their debts; when money gradually loses some of its value, so, too, do people's debts.
