what the hell's going on?
the shadow...watch out for the shadow.
What're you talking about?
the shadow...what do you mean?
Hey...Nolt?
Hey, Nolt, what the hell happened to you, huh?
he's...he's dead!
no, he's not!
come on, Nolt...
come on, snap out of it, come on...
0h my God, damn it, come on!
I need you!
Oh god...Nolt !
Oh, God...we're getting close.
Those...are the windmills of the Barbarois.
I really wish you'd turn back.
there must be another way.
there isn't.
I am D, the hunter
I have business with the Barbarois.
Oh, no...
so I see you have dismounted.
you have respect for your elders.
that's very considerate indeed.
I want you to stop your protection of Meier Link.
you what?
you know, you make me laugh, that's a good one.
I see you are a very humorous young man, and beautiful too, I might add.
or does that make you uncomfortable, to have an old lech like me admire you so?
do you take me for a fool?
someone paid me a hundred million dollars to protect Meier Link.
can you top that?
well, you drive a hard bargain there, old man what if I can?
you really are entertaining me, Mr. Stranger!
I suppose you know our reputation the Barbarois serve the people of the night, and after five thousand years, I don't think we're about to change our stripes anytime soon, although if we did for anyone it would be for you.
I have seen many a dhampir, but somebody like you I've never seen before.
that's why it's such a pity that you have to die.
I really can't let you leave here alive, now, can I?
I'm afraid you have to die, Stranger.
so sorry.
the Barbarois are great warriors.
you are a warrior too, no doubt and although you may kill some of us, in the end we will prevail.
I have sworn to protect the carriage prepare to die!
fool!
what's he doin' in there?
Borgoff, are we ready yet?
grove we have no choice.
we need your help on this, Grove.
think you can do it there, man?
give it to me
I'm waiting.
don't push yourself too hard, now.
I mean it, OK
I want you back.
you know, I really have nothing against the Barbarois personally.
it's a shame I'll have to kill so many of you.
indeed, I admire your loyalty and your devotion to duty.
yet I wonder about the fairness when you allow one to fight against so many.
but...if that will entertain you...
I see.
you make I see, a good argument, young man how interesting.
Oh, man, I think the fellow is right.
please allow the three of us to entertain our young guest here, unless he thinks that's unfair three against one, how unfair, three against one, unfair...
that's enough!
you mock us with your ridiculous antics, Benge.
I will not have you distracting us from the job at hand, which is the protection of the carriage.
we'll do things my way...huh?
what the devil is that?
go for it, Grove...go for it!
kill all those guys kill every last one of 'em!
come on, Grove, hold on.
get the carriage out now!
follow me, Tinkerbell.
I'm waiting for you!
grove!
I've got to say this
I admire that young hunter's spirit, although he doesn't stand a chance against Benge and the others.
still, it's a pity I'll miss the show.
Oh well.
wake up, D!
what's wrong with you?
it's not fair, it's not fair
I'll show you what's not fair!
stay there till you rot, hunter!
suckers!
stop, I beg you.
say goodnight.
Kyle, did you happen to see where that girl went?
maybe she got caught in the wheels.
go look.
nice, Caroline, very nice.
a little crude, but effective.
they're all yours!
that freakin' monster.
is everybody all right?
Yeah, but Kyle was outside.
he was up on top.
Kyle?
Kyle, where the hell are you, Kyle?
down here!
you OK?
quiet! They're still around!
No!
Damn! That idiot!
well, how convenient this is for me.
come on out here so I can finish the job.
your time is up.
come on, you coward!
you're gonna pay for the pain you caused my brother.
D! Are you awake?
I need your help to swallow up this spell.
you're a slave driver, you know that?
Hey, remember to watch out for the shadow, huh?
try and stay still.
easier said than done.
and keep your mouth shut.
that was close...
well, the tank is full a holes.
fuel's all gone, we can't drive it like this anyway.
What're we gonna do?
what should we do?
Borgoff, any idea?
how's Grove?
honestly, not too great.
Borgoff, wake up!
what are you thinking about over there?
Oh, nothin', really.
I was just thinkin' about the carriage.
wonder where it is by now.
well, man, at this point it's pretty much anybody's guess.
if you want my opinion, I'd say they're either setting sail from the port of Abrol or hiding somewhere deep in the Grenerge Mountain Range.
I sure hope so.
anyway, we still have to get some fuel and the town of Garucia isn't that far away from here.
Kyle, you go with Leila.
I'll stay here and do the repairs.
if you are seeking the pathway to the stars, come to me.
I pray for your safe arrival with all my heart.
the pathway to the stars...
I dunno about you, but y'know, I sure miss that horse.
what was his name?
Oh...oh, the silent treatment, huh?
well, I got two words for you: Heat syndrome.
look -- look, I know I'm a parasite, but haven't I always been a helpful parasite?
you may not care if you die from heat but becoming a piece of beef jerky is not a lifelong ambition of mine.
Yeah, well, what's the sound of one hand yapping...
how much?
Oh no -- keep your money.
C'mon, just take it
let's go.
Leila?
Oh. I see.
it's him, isn't it?
Kyle, why don't you start back without me.
there's something I want to do here first.
back off.
have I told you you're quite irresistible in that sexy skin-tight getup?
no -- tell me about it.
I just did.
make sure you watch your back with that guy, Leila.
I'd like a beer.
I've just been admirin' your fancy weapon there.
don't worry.
I have no plans to use it anytime soon.
that's good.
that's good, 'cause I have no plans to let you keep it.
give it up.
you heard me, little girl.
Mm. Thank you.
well, here's to you, Sheriff.
I'd buy you a drink, but...
thank you, but no thanks.
Oh, oK. I was just gonna say, you must be awfully busy with that new dhampir hunter in the town now.
what dhampir hunter?
I'd like to buy that horse.
three hundred thousand dollars.
and if you don't like the price, go somewhere else.
Freeze! Put your hands where I can see 'em. Now!
sheriff, he paid good money for that.
what are you doing?!
take your money and go.
we don't want you here.
we don't sell to dhampirs in this town, understand?
understand me, dhampir?
you understand.
wait a minute. That's my horse you're talking about there, and I'll sell it to whoever I want if they can afford the price I'm asking.
you can't do that.
we have laws against it, Polk...good laws, and for a damn good reason.
what laws?
don't play coy, Polk, you know as well as I dhampirs aren't allowed.
not allowed, right ...
I remember a time not that long ago when we had vampires and dhampirs both around here. But...
and that's why we have the law.
listen to me, whether you want to hear it or not...you weren't even born when this happened.
do yourself a favor and listen to the story.
I'm going to tell you about the time when the children were kidnapped.
there were ten children altogether ...
Yeah, I heard about that time.
the kidnappers turned out to be vampires, of course.
and so the townspeople pooled their money to hire a vampire hunter.
they wanted the best.
and when the hunter came...
he was a very strong and quiet man.
and he did his job, too, which was to return the children safely back into their parents' homes.
it wasn't easy, but many vampires died by his hands before this job was over with.
and when it was over and the children were back home, the people attacked the man.
they said he was a dhampir, half vampire himself...so they punished him.
can't say I blame them for doing that.
you can't trust 'em, that's all that's about.
they were right about that part, Polk.
he did the job!
I see then, I'll have to take matters into my own hands.
let him go.
what is that?
what does it look like, idiot?
put down your guns.
Polk, you can't know what you're doing ... put it down...
I know exactly what I'm doing.
you don't know! Put it down now, you old fool!
I would much rather be an old fool than what you are, Sheriff.
now, don't shoot.
I can tell you I won't think twice about using this weapon.
I might even enjoy it.
get on your horse, Stranger.
thank you.
no, it's only fitting I thank you.
it's the least I can do.
I may be just an old fool now, Stranger, but I could never forget a face like yours.
and I'll never forget what you done for me back then.
that's right...I was one of them kids.
and I always felt bad about that the way you was treated.
how nobody stopped you, nobody thanked you instead the ignorant bastards ran you right out of our town.
so it's true, isn't it, what they say about you dhampirs.
you don't age.
now go...I'm getting tired.
well, the horses are rested now. We'd better go.
come on.
master, what is it? May I help you, sir?
it's still light outside, Master!
What...?
leave her alone, Mashira.
Yes, sir.
she misses the sunlight. Let her enjoy it.
I am D, the hunter.
your father sent me.
don't be afraid...I won't hurt you.
you sit in the sunlight...you must not be changed.
so why do you stay with him?
last night in the carriage you called out his name.
why did you call for him?
I suppose my father has not told you that I'm in love with Meier.
you don't know who he is.
you can't be in love with him.
well, I am.
if you only knew how good he's been to me.
I love him.
please believe me, no one else will.
you don't understand.
he is what he is, Charlotte.
you can't change him, he'll take you in time.
and when that happens, I will have to kill you.
fine, kill me, then.
I would rather die than to go anywhere without him.
don't take me back there...I mean it. I simply could not live without Meier.
how sweet that is.
she loves a vampire.
so very sweet.
idiot!
you stupid girl, get up! We're going.
leave me alone!
you'll do what I say.
do you have any idea how many people have died at the hands of your beloved Meier, this vampire you wanna protect!
none!
you fool! And you...you stay right where you are, my friend.
sorry, but I really don't want to have to share any of my profits.
you understand, don't you...it's business.
above you.
what's wrong? Tell me!
too much sun.
I warned you about the heat, but you don't listen!
come on. You can't survive unless you dig a hole. You need to bury yourself!
Hurry!
Leila! Leila, are you there? Come in, Leila.
Yeah, I copy.
thank God. Are you OK? What's your position?
I'm near Lake Chiffon. Our game is heading north from here.
we'll catch up.
Leila, do you know what's happened to the dhampir hunter?
no, I haven't seen him.
all right. Well, take care.
stay in touch. Borgoff out.
the tables have turned.
now, that cleared my head.
I really should return the favor, don't you think, honey?
don't get any ideas.
Hey, I'm just trying to stay dry here.
if there was any other place to go, believe me, I'd be there.
as soon as the rain lets up, I'll be gone from here and from you.
I think I can guess your problem.
your family was the victim of vampires.
you don't know what you're talking about.
you don't know anything about it.
all right. Perhaps I don't.
this stupid thing...it bothers me.
you really are a weird one, you know that?
in spite of being a dhampir hunter and all that that entails.
how did you know about my mother?
you called her name, remember?
she was kidnapped by vampires.
my father went after her and was trying to rescue her ... so they killed him.
and after a while my mother returned, but she wasn't my mother any more she'd been changed.
the people in the village stoned her to death while I watched.
after that I left home.
I met the Markus brothers and joined with them.
I wanted to be a hunter to avenge my parents' deaths.
I've seen many terrible things since then, lives destroyed, families devastated, hopes crushed...
every time, it seems ... vampire is to blame.
I can understand why you'd choose to do it, but the life of a hunter is no kind of life.
it's the only life I'm any good for now, and it looks like it's the only life you've ever known.
so I suggest we make a pact.
since we're both in it for the long haul, whoever dies first, the other one can come and bring flowers to their grave.
how's that?
it's the rain makes me sentimental.
I don't know why I should care about that...it's just I love flowers.
and I don't think I'll be getting any...
I'm all alone, after all.
we have that much in common, don't we.
that we're both hunters and we're both alone.
Oh well, I'm being silly...doesn't really matter
I'll do it.
I'll bring you flowers if I survive this...but I don't expect to.
stop, I didn't really mean it when I said that.
and anyway, I don't really understand why you should keep on doing this.
because I'm a dhampir.
I don't get to have a life; not like you.
well, with the rainstorm last night, they can't be too far away.
we're even now, dhampir...understand?
I have a very bad feeling about this.
how so?
I think I've finally figured it out, Borgoff.
well, I'm sure you're right...if you're thinking they're headed for the castle.
Yeah, that's right, the castle...the Castle of Chaythe!
what are you thinking, we can't go in there, it would be suicide!
what are you now, afraid of a little insanity?
since when have we been sane?
we just have to get to them before they reach the castle.
there's a bridge up ahead...that's where we intercept the carriage.
I remember that trick from the time we got those vampires at Keldo.
Yeah, it worked that time, and it can work again now.
Leila, come in, come in, Leila. Over.
yeah it's me, I copy.
what's up?
I'm on my way.
don't move.
I'm warning you...try anything funny and you'll be blown to smithereens.
you wanna try it?
I didn't think so.
we just want the girl.
hello there!
she's still human!
come on, get out of there. Now!
Borgoff, she won't come.
we're doing you a favor!
come on, I said get outta there!
let that be a lesson to you, you cowardly Barbarois animal.
Borgoff, look.
Borgoff!
what? What the --?
what, is this guy crazy?
doesn't he know he can't exist outside here in the sunlight?
I won't let you take her!
Oh, yeah?
thanks a lot...you're making our job a lot easier.
hot enough for you?
what you deserve!
over here, hot stuff!
Oohoo, lookit him burn!
No!
what the hell do you want...
how's that feel...moron!
lookit him!
Hey, where do you think...!
why'd you let her go!
I love you.
I can't go on without you.
what?
Borgoff, we should just let her kill herself and then we can finish him off, what do you think about that idea?
we get the money if she's dead or alive.
Hey, you're right...OK.
stop it!
Kyle!
I'll blow you to hell!
what!
I don't want you to worry about these wounds of mine.
they will heal.
then we shall go to the city of night and distant stars.
when we go there we can be alone and free to love each other.
it's true, believe me, we'll be there soon.
we're it now, we're the only ones left, Borgoff, we should just give it up.
if we make it into that castle, none of us will make it out alive.
we can't quit now.
we owe it to Kyle and to Nolt to keep going on.
listen, Borgoff...
Shaddup! I won't hear it.
Leila...what do you think?
grove, they fear us.
they fear us because they know our reputation. That we never give up.
and we never can.
if we quit now, we might as well quit the business, and I can't do that.
I won't do it...till every last one of them is gone.
Master...do you hear?
he is coming.
the castle is nearby.
I'll stay here and deal with him.
getting close. The Castle of Chaythe.
soon we'll be able to see it the home of Carmila, the Bloody Countess.
you've heard of her.
for five thousand years her rule of terror lasted, and then, that was that!
your father, the vampire king, grew angry.
he was impatient with her vanity, offended by her bloodlust, her gluttony.
he grew so tired that he killed her while she slept, impaling her on a sword, and that was it for her.
except she haunts the place now with phantoms and demons, but you don't care about that, do you?
but I bet I know what really gets to you, dhampir what really gets to you the thought of those two lovebirds giving birth to another dhampir, huh?
that's it.
you see, I know you， I know how you think, I know how you feel, I know every move that you make, you can't...
I'm glad we could meet at last, Hunter D.
you are a worthy opponent.
who hired the Barbarois?
who were you working for?
it was Carmila who hired us.
and as a Barbarois, my duty has been fulfilled.
now I can die in peace.
well, what are you going to do with him, looking like that?
bitch! That's not fair.
No!
marcella what? - We don't know her last name yet.
but, nickname's La Tuscana.
strange. Tuscans generally aren't the superstitious kind.
as a matter of fact, she was Southern. Sicilian or Calabrian.
well, see if you can find out why they call her La Tuscana.
Yes, Sir. I'll get on it right away.
look. Let me get rid of this, at least. I mean, we've got to be reasonable, dear.
or you'll look like a piece of fruit cake! - You're telling me! I want to get married in white with orange blossoms. - Well then, insist on it.
that's too dangerous. You know how stubborn Mario is.
he might cancel the wedding.
Hello?
Yes, she is. I think she's free. I'll ask. Just a moment.
giulia? It's a call for you. - Thank you.
Hello? Hello?
Botique Jolie? Oh boy! Hello?
cut off. It happens often at this hour. They'll probably call back in a minute.
all I can say is, faced with that dress,
I'd rather give up marriage! - But you're selling my stuff.
can I help it if people go for nutty designers these days?
Ciao, Mario. - What'd you take away the scarf for?
so you're the culprit. Wanda! Take this away, and you'd ruin the whole design. It'd make her look like some sort of call girl! - I beg your pardon!
Wanda, just carry out my designs. Haven't you gotten rich on them?
here. Have the cutters start on these. It's the winter line for St. Moritz.
Yes, Master. - Mario?
did you tell anyone that I had an appointment here? - Why?
someone phoned. He asked for me, but there was no one there when I answered.
that happens to pretty girls! Uh, listen. Are you coming to that opening with me tonight? - No. You should enjoy your last free hours as a bachelor by yourself. - Sure! With a bunch of abstract painters!
good evening? La Nuova Pea Gallery. Yes, we're having a show opening tonight.
I'll see if I can locate her for you. Could I have that name again, please?
Kathy Adams? Hold on.
Hello? Hello, who is this?
well? Hello!
Ciao, Kathy. Ciao! Tomorrow at ten. Don't forget!
I won't, Lariana. Cheerio!
Oh, poor kittens! Yes.
Oh! You're starving, aren't you?
you have a very bad Mummy! I hope you're not going to denounce me to... how do you call it in Italy?
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
I'll give it to you.
there we go!
come on, darling!
that's it!
Oh, you're angry! Of course. That's right!
my poor kitties...
I forgot to open the door for...
who's there?
you really think it's only a coincidence?
it's like that everywhere nowadays. It's the latest fashion.
let's make an hypothesis.
two dead girls and a single killer.
now, did the girls know each other? And what could they have had in common?
they were both found half naked. - The English girl was in her apartment and getting ready for bed. - Was she... - Yes, all alone.
okay. But, take a...
right now, the main thing is to identify the Tuscana.
Oh please, darling, the window.
you laugh, huh? Yeah, it's a riot. - Call the conductor.
while I'm at it, you want a coffee? - No thanks.
well, I'm gonna go for a sandwich, okay? - Okay.
Ah, go on, Mario!
lady, are you alright? Oh, my God!
that's Sylvio, a designer. Sylvio Gragert. He works with me.
giorgio Romani. Just a friend, of both of ours.
that's Bruno Belli. He used to be in love with Giulia.
he's married now. His wife had twins a couple of weeks ago.
that's Giovanni Nepal, the janitor from my old apartment.
who's he? That one, I don't know at all. - No, I shouldn't think you would.
that's Police. Lieutenant Renzi. Very clever.
a distant relative. Kid who works in our office.
in other words, all friends. Not a stranger in the lot.
Yeah. Looks like it.
looks like we scored a big, fat zero. Do you read the news at all?
the police always score big, fat zeros. If it weren't for inside info here and there. Only, in these cases there's never anyone to come up with it.
when did you first meet your wife? - Three years ago.
vino Betello, her father owned the hotel there.
after her father died, Giulia sold out and then came on down to Rome.
then, out of the blue, we met again. - So, for a while there, she might have been doing anything. - You're not still trying to find a connection with the two other killings? - How come you're so sure there's none?
impossible! What in the world would Giulia have in common with those two girls?
huh! That's the question! - And, a psychopathic killer like him would also have left his trademark with Giulia. This pin, or whatever it is.
the arrival of the conductor prevented it.
some mail came for your wife at her old address this morning.
or whatever it is.
well, how's our victim? You had a very nice funeral. Lots of flowers.
what an awful pity I wasn't there. - Whoever your attacker was, for the time being, it's best that he believes that you were there.
let's hope it's not going to be for long, inspector.
you sure this means nothing to you? Think very hard.
no. Nothing.
and you're sure you've never met this woman before?
no. I thought all night long, but...
I'm not much good at remembering faces. Just have no memory for them.
because of your shock I've held this one back until now. - Inez! I'm sure!
she worked at our hotel. - Are you positive it's her?
Absolutely! She was a very good girl. She wasn't a very good maid.
but she tried awfully hard. She came from some village in Calabria.
but she was known as La Tuscana. - The hotel's in Tuscany, though.
did you ever run in to her here?
no. Never. - Can you think of anyone who might have had a grudge against this girl, Inez? And against you, too?
against me and Inez?
Mario, do you remember Rau? - Rau? No. No, I don't.
of course. You never met him. Giovanni Rau. Sort of an unpleasant guy.
he was more or less engaged to Inez. But then he stole and was arrested.
in fact, I denounced him. And Inez was for it.
and, why do you say she was for it? - He took advantage of her job to commit robbery. And, when she found out, she felt humiliated. She was very proud of her honesty.
now, come on, Rau, confess! - Admit it, Rau, you're the murderer!
never met no Kathy Adams. - Inez Tambourini, you knew her.
Giulia Gerosa, you knew her. - Yes, but it wasn't me that...
let's say the conductor recognized you. - He couldn't have. I wasn't there.
where the hell were you Tuesday night? - I'm innocent, I swear it.
I'm innocent. I want to talk to my lawyer. - Tuesday night! You're gonna tell us where you were! Go on! Confess, Rau! - On Tuesday... I forget, Lieutenant.
you killed the English woman that night, didn't you? - No!
tuesday night! - I'm not... I'm not sure.
I know Rau. He's a louse and a petty thief.
but, I doubt that he's capable of murder. - You agree then with Inspector Vismara?
if Rau is innocent, the real killer is still free to murder at will.
in which case you're much safer here. - No. I've had enough of this place.
we'll let everyone believe that I'm dead for the moment.
and when we come back, we'll see about taking a decision with the police.
I'd be the happiest guy in the world if it was all cleared up when we get back.
Mario!
it's from Vismara. A little souvenir.
who runs around killing and presents trinkets to all of his girlfriends.
wait! Now I recognize it. Seeing it on a key-ring, it looks different.
two years ago there was an American who had one just like it.
he left it on his table in the restaurant at our hotel one day.
Yes, I'm sure. He was an American.
he was tall, young...
only, his face escapes me. - Do you remember his name by any chance?
no. I never knew it. He wasn't a client of ours.
just came to the hotel to eat. He lived in a resident's hotel.
Yes, that's right. The River Del Sole.
well? - We'll drive on up to the hotel, and we'll see if anyone there can recall him. - Okay.
poor Signora Gerosa. Unfortunately, I never actually met her.
when I bought the hotel it was all done through our lawyers.
but, when I saw her name in the paper, I recognized it immediately.
what a monster to knife a girl like that. Are you the police?
no. I was just hired to investigate... - I see, a private detective.
I'm sorry, but your trip was for nothing. Our personnel changed completely.
the former barkeeper was still here. But then, he left for Switzerland a month ago. So there's... - Nobody.
police are searching for the killer, who last Thursday stabbed a young woman to death in her sleeping compartment on the Rome-Paris Express.
although there are no further clues regarding the killer's identity...
why are we going back to the hotel? - To have a look at the old registers.
by law, you have to keep them for five years. Let's try to trace some of the guests. Maybe there's someone who has a better memory for faces than I.
but, are you certain it was in September? - It was the end of the season.
there's one page missing. The one for September 29, 1969. See?
Yeah. It was ripped out. Listen, has anyone else asked to see this register? - Not that I know of, no.
Oh! Now that you asked me... One day my wife went in and found the books in disorder. If you'll wait, I'll go and go and check with her.
well, let's assume the page is missing. Have a look and see if there are any changes from the 28th to the 30th. - What changes?
compare the names. Whoever was in the hotel on the 28th or the 30th must also have been present on the 29th. - But if he only spent one night here?
no. That wouldn't have happened in Spetember.
luciano Augusto, the 28th... Augusto, the 30th.
Ferri, Raffaele and Ferri, Anita, the 28th and the 30th.
Kathy Adams!
how could I have remembered Miss Adams?
she was only here four days, from September 27th until the 30th.
if someone ripped out the page because he wanted to make her name disappear, he'd have ripped out four pages, wouldn't he?
obviously that wasn't it. He wanted the list of guests on the 29th who were all here on the 28th and 30th.
I've got them all listed here. - Let me see something.
Anita Ferri, Kathy Adams, Elena Marchi!
I remember her. And also the teacher, Concetta de Rosa. Four women.
Oh, no, there's another woman, Anna Sartori. That makes five.
and then, there's poor Inez. And myself. - Well, that's seven. So?
well, a man who likes to run around, giving silver half moons to women.
what if he only bore a grudge against these women?
the American with the key-ring.
three out of seven. And all women. He killed Inez, Kathy Adams...
and then he tried to murder you. Sure, it's a good theory. But...
if what we think is true, then the other four women might also be in danger.
you can relax now, Mr. Gerosa. Nothing to worry about. He's confessed.
I say Rau confessed. Giovanni Rau. We'll give you the whole story when you get back. You're on your honeymoon now, so enjoy it! Enjoy it!
wait! I'm not through yet. Listen!
well? - He cut me off right in mid-sentence.
Mario, after all, they're the policemen. - Since when are you so damn sure that the police can do no wrong?
can I see your Rome phonebook, please? - Rome phonebook? Sure.
here we go.
here, they're always trying to force things down your throat.
I'm not as loony as they think, that's for sure.
just waiting her chance. It's not the first time she's tried to kill me, Franca.
franca, you've got to help me! I don't want to be killed!
of course not, Marchi. Now, try to calm down.
go on! You'll be alright. - She's playing very innocent, isn't she? But she'll kill me the first chance she gets.
she wishes me in hell. That woman's a devil!
she's not a devil at all. Now, calm down!
she is. You don't believe me, Franca. You must, though. Please. You must.
no one wants to hurt you, Signora Marchi. Come, lie down for a while. You're tired.
go look! Under that pillow. You know what's under that pillow, Franca?
she's got a knife hidden under there. Yes, I saw her hide it there.
it's a thermometer. See? It's just a thermometer.
it was a knife, though. She's a devil. She changed it.
mad!
there was a knife there.
Yes. No, you have the correct ward. Hold on a minute, Sir.
Signorina Marchi has a phone call. - Do you hear that? It's for you.
you don't want to talk? Tell them to call back later. Come on.
could you poss... Hello?
did you get the wrong number? - No. She doesn't live there anymore.
have we tried all of them now? - No. Conchetta de Rosa is in Palermo.
Anita Ferri is dead a year, natural cause. Anna Sartori married Palmieri, and they're touring Australia. So Elena Marchi is most likely the next.
we must find her.
look, tomorrow I'll find Vismara and tell him the whole story. - No!
come on! He's not gonna get her tonight. - Just the same, that woman's in danger.
alright, alright. We'll do what you want. I just hope we manage to find her.
the Signora became real bad. The owner of the house had her move out.
and I think she went to her sister's in Via Castellini. No, wait a minute...
I'm not sure. It could have been Via Castellino?
via Castellino? That's all the way across the city!
either Via Castellino or Via Castellini. If I recall correctly, she said a building with an iron gate.
I see no iron gate.
I guess it's Via Castellini.
listen, how about letting Via Castellino go until tomorrow?
Yes, it would be the most reasonable thing to do.
that one.
now, get yourself a good nights sleep.
and don't think about those awful things anymore. You promise me?
take your pills.
go to sleep now. Good night.
wait! Listen, Franca. Please stay here a while. I'm afraid.
there's no reason to be. Come on. Go to sleep now.
there's an iron gate.
she's in the hospital, like I told you. - Yes. But which hospital?
one of those loony people's hospitals. - Maybe we find a phone number.
let me in a sec... - I don't let anyone in at this hour!
I'm not gonna hurt you! Open up!
Franca!
franca, help!
Franca!
open the door! Let me out!
Franca!
it's the Marchi lady. I've had it with that persecution complex of hers.
didn't she take the tranquilizer? - Yes. Give it a while, then. She'll calm down.
help! Franca!
Franca! Help!
open the door! Open the door, please!
Franca! Open the door!
franca, open the door!
open the door! Open...
wait here, okay?
look! It's a matter of life or death! - Didn't you call a few minutes ago?
would you let me talk to Signora Marchi? - Sir, it's after visiting hours.
and anyway, you'll have to get permission from the director.
then what? - I never got a look at his face.
the lights went out all of a sudden and I was terrified.
right. You can go back to work. - Where's Palumbo?
he's out trying to get information on those other women from the hotel and the American, Gerosa mentioned to you. - Ah, are you still here?
what are you waiting for? The press? - Do you mean to say, you think I did this for publicity's sake? - I don't think anything.
all I know is you were at the right place at the right time.
you might say your alibi's almost perfect. - Just have you got against us?
you're a rationist. Now, why don't you take your wife on home.
after all, we're still responsible for her safety.
you? For her? Let's drop it, man. Huh? You know what I say?
you police can go to hell with your methods. I'll look after her myself.
listen, Mario... - Let's go. - Nevertheless, for the moment, your wife stays dead. Renzi? I want two men outside their house.
why didn't you tell me he called?
just then we'd torn Rau's alibi to shreds. He confessed everything...
you gave him the third degree for 2 nights. If that ever gets to the press, our careers are blown.
when's the one in Australia due back? - Their mate said, the next week, or so.
how many days? How many hours? - I did the best I could, Sir.
let's hope you did a little better with the other one. What's her name?
de Rosa! Concetta de Rosa.
her permanent residence is in Palermo, where her family is. The last four years, she taught in Perugia, Todi and Urpino. How could our murderer find out she lives here in Spinato. - The same way as you...
by calling the Department of Education.
I'm going to Rome. You understand?
I was going to Rome.
Signorina de Rosa? - Yes? The director would like to speak to you.
be quiet for a moment.
you'll be under police surveillance. You're not to go anywhere on your own.
we'll be listening to all calls on your phone and any calls for you here.
and, if you ever think of anything... If you could help any investigation...
a tall, fellow American. But, I'd remember him if I'd met him.
you see, I do remember Signora Marchi, the maid, and poor Signorina Torresi.
two more guardian angels. They came for the changing of the guard.
the world thinks you're dead forever. I've had our place in Parioli closed.
and I used a fake name when I rented this pad. So relax, will you?
I'll never feel safe until they get him. - Are you absolutely sure there's nothing else you can recall about that American? - Oh, please. Don't start that again!
let me see. You said the only time he came to the hotel was to eat.
isn't that right? - Yes.
doesn't it seem a little strange to you that someone living in one hotel would eat in another? That's illogical.
nothing makes any sense in this story. And now, three women have been killed.
could make sense if our friend had some special reason of his own for going there.
well, our food was good.
score one for the good guys.
Ah, if we could just put a face on his damn ghost!
did you keep the list of addresses from the hotel register? - Yes. Why?
that's enough, boys! Stop it! Quiet down! Quiet!
I'm looking for a certain Signore Ferri. A Raffaele Ferri.
you've found him.
not like that. The lips are much thinner. I've got a photographic memory.
I forgot his name, but his face will always be on file on my brain.
so, show me what you've got.
Yes. Yes, that's him alright.
tell me, did you ever talk to the man there at the hotel?
you know how it is when you're on holiday. One night, we talked about this and that.
and, you know why he remained so impressed on my mind? Because of a contradiction.
the man was a protestant. Yet, he went to mass every single Sunday.
he was a fanatic for Gregorian chants.
you're sure he wasn't catholic?
positive.
well, goodbye, Sir. And thanks. - You're welcome.
I don't know. I can't say. It's a completely unfamiliar face.
he's American, you say? - Yes. I draw a complete blank, I'm afraid.
in other words, you can't help me? - No. I'm awfully sorry.
no harm in trying. Thanks all the same. - You're welcome.
good morning. - Goodbye.
I'm one of the oldest and most deciduous members here.
he doesn't belong to our church. I've never seen him. Well, I'm sorry.
certainly not around here. But, one should try where the artists hang out.
you know, painters, hippies, vagabonds...
thanks for the advice.
Oh, sure.
hey man, I know this cad. He's a friend of Barrett's.
who? - You got a 1, 000 more for a candy freak?
Yeah, a friend of Barrett's. Thanks.
uh, where's Barrett? - Screwing, dear!
you...
who's Barrett?
what do you want?
Frank.
you know that queen, Jack? - Yes. But I don't know where to find him right now. - And why should I know?
july '69 was the last time I saw him. Sure got hung up on some chick, I heard.
you mean, Frank had a girl? - Hold still, damn it!
you were saying, Frank had a girl. - Yes. And I haven't seen him since then.
I got back from the States a month ago, anyhow. So I can't help you. So long.
wait a moment! Just who was this girl? - What's the matter? You jealous?
now, you listen to me and listen good! I don't feel like kidding around, and I haven't got the time to smash your face in! So answer me straight!
alright. You asked for it. I never met the bitch, and I couldn't give a shit! That door's open all the time.
did this belong to Frank? - I think so. Where did you get it?
someone had the bright idea of sending it to my wife in the mail one day.
uh, what's his name again? Frank... - Saunders.
if you know something about Frank Saunders, call 3072200
I'll be right outside.
good afternoon. - Afternoon.
anything new? - Nothing. Just a telephone call.
who was it? - The parish priest, wanting to know why she didn't go to mass yesterday. - Better she'd stay at home today, too.
as a matter of fact, she is going, Sir. I sent Salvi and Garozzo with her.
when did she leave, Lieutenant? - About twenty minutes ago.
let's hear the tape of that phone call.
she's in the confessional.
I'm sorry, Father Anníbale, but I just couldn't get there yesterday.
Yes. But that's not the only reason I called.
it's about the new religion text book for the High School.
I'd be very interested in your opinion of it.
of course. Any time after four, I'll be here.
alright, Father.
thank you, Concetta. Goodbye.
Ah, excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you.
I was looking for Signorina de Rosa, who is going to come to see me.
but, unfortunately, I received a call to attend a dying man.
when I got there, he was fine. Well, now that I'm here,
I'd like to leave these books, so she needn't bother to come.
what are you doing out here? - Salvi's inside...
where is she? - She's confessing, Sir.
which one? - That one.
Concetta de Rosa, a teacher, was found murdered a few hours ago.
the police is stating the killer is once again the 'Half Moon Maniac', making this his fifth murder. The fact that the victim was strangled in a local church has brought a special bizarreness to this incredible case.
Hello, Mario? Where are you? What...
technically, down at the Daily America.
Yes. I heard about it. Look, please Giulia, stay calm. Yes, yes.
I'll get home as soon as possible, okay?
Yes, I promise you. Ciao. Ciao. Ciao.
awfully sorry to have kept you waiting.
Mr. Saunders is not listed as taking delivery.
Oh well, I guess I'm just unlucky. - You're not, you're very lucky.
I looked in the archives. Delivery to him was stopped two years ago.
via Casal Bruciato 8. Miss, you're a genius! Thanks very much.
not at all.
what did he want? - The address of a subscriber.
someone called Saunders.
is there anyone here?
are you looking for Frank Saunders? Are you?
that's right.
go to the Via Caio Cestio number 6. Have you got that?
via Caio Cestio number 6. But, who am I speaking to? Hello?
hey there! Looking for someone? - Yes. For an American.
what's the name? - Frank Saunders.
Saunders?
Signore, over here!
I believe I've found him.
you did say Frank Saunders, didn't you? - Dead.
well, what'd you think? You were gonna find him alive here?
strange. Orchids stained with red. - Not the kind of flowers for a grave.
seven orchids and seven women. Who brought them?
poor fellow. This is the first respects anyone paid him.
there's been no flowers, no visitors, nothing.
and what a sad funeral it was. The kind that hospitals give to poor people.
you mean, that's where he died? - Yep. The American Hospital.
the American Hospital.
Finally! Couldn't wait to get home. - That goes for me, too.
Palmieri!
is this your wife here? Anna Sartori? - Yes. Why?
please come with us. It's only a formality.
it's ridiculous! It's absurd!
my husband hasn't even smuggled in a carton of cigarettes. Imagine drugs!
you see, whenever we get these calls... - Then check it before bothering people!
I'm sorry, Ma'am. I'm just following orders.
it sounds so unreal. - There are four dead women to prove it.
correction, five women. Five victims, Signore Palmieri.
and we want to prevent your wife from becoming the sixth. - Yes.
but, what worries me is... - We've already taken into account her emotional balance, which, according to your mother-in-law, is a bit fragile.
she suffered a shock a while back. And she's never completely recovered.
well, God only knows how she'll react. - We'll use a drug bid as our excuse.
that way, we should be able to protect her without her suspecting anything.
Frank Saunders. Yes, I remember him very well.
he died as the result of a car accident. But, in my opinion, he was murdered.
murdered? - Not in the scripted sense of the word, but just as cold blooded leaving the scene of an accident.
the driver was a woman. Why she ran off and left him to bleed to death,
I have no idea. Perhaps she lost her head, or didn't want to face the responsibility.
or else, she could have had something she wanted to hide.
one thing I do know, though... If he'd been brought here an hour sooner,
I could have saved Saunders. - And, wasn't this woman ever found?
I don't think so.
Where'd they have the accident? - Just outside Rome.
and the car belonged to Saunders? - Yes, but she was at the wheel.
the one I consider the murderer. I put that in the report that I wrote out for the Consulate. And, if your police, for some reason or other, acted on it. It's no fault of mine.
they never did, huh?
is there any way I could see it? - Certainly. Anyone can see it.
just ask. They'll show it to you.
Signore Gerosa?
roma F47704. And I've only seen it once.
of course, photographic memory. - I recall everything about our friend.
to start with, he was an evangelical baptist.
and his name is Fred Saunders. - Frank Saunders.
now, wait a second. If I say Fred... - Then you just made a rare mistake.
it's Frank Saunders, that is... it was.
because he was murdered two years ago. - What was that?
two years ago last fall. Just about the time the two of you met.
mind if I ask how old your wife is?
my wife, when she died, was only twenty-seven.
mind telling me your reason for asking? - Oh, no reason. Just asking.
why don't you tell Vismara the whole story and leave it all to him?
tell what? That you're American's been dead and buried for two years now?
he wasn't my American! I wasn't the woman who left him to die on the highway!
but, what if Vismara doesn't believe you? Look, if the police got Rau to confess, they have no trouble convincing you. And since Frank is dead and buried, he couldn't be the killer anyhow. - What about the man who phoned you?
have you any idea who he could be? - Yeah. Someone who took it upon himself to tell me that Saunders was dead. - He could be an accomplice.
sure he could. - Or he might be the murderer.
of course! He was afraid that in looking for Saunders, you would discover something about him! Don't you see? There's a link between the murderer and Saunders. - So, he had me find Saunders because he was dead. And therefore, must have nothing to do with this story.
he's actually trying to make me think I'm following a false trail.
how could he know that you were looking for Saunders?
I left a message in Barrett's house. And I sure wouldn't give Barrett any prizes for honesty.
I want to speak to your friend, Barrett. - Sorry. He isn't in.
Hey, wait a minute! I said he wasn't here!
look! You just can't come busting into people's houses like this!
morphine? Answer, kid! Is it morphine he's on?
heroin, kid!
can you hear me, Barrett? - Can't you see the lousy trip he's on?
stay out of this, kid. Or you'll only make things worse.
Frank is dead.
what the hell do I care, for Pete's sake? - Frank Saunders was murdered, Barrett.
I don't give a shit. Now, get the hell out of here!
you who called me up at Frank's old house, didn't you? You couldn't stand the idea that Frank had fallen in love with a girl. So you set up a clever little accident.
why did you get rid of that message I'd written on the poster?
alright! You've had your fun! Now... - I said, stay out of this!
okay, Barrett. What have you got to say? You never went back to the States,
Barrett, did you? - Look, leave me alone! Go away!
you'd better call a doctor. And fast!
wait! Give me a shot!
I have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them.
neither did I turn again until they were consumed.
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise.
they are fallen under my feet. - Thou hast also given me the next of mine enemies.
long live, and blessed be my rock. Let the God of my salvation be exhaulted.
for thou hast guarded me with strength unto the battle. Thou hast...
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
good morning, Father. - Good morning. Have a seat.
thank you. I'm sorry to barge in on you like this, but it's about that American again. Do you remember? - Of course.
did you manage to find him? - Hm. His name is Frank Saunders.
and he's in the cemetery in Via Caio Cestio.
I'm sorry. How can I help you, if I may ask?
well, the circumstances which surrounded Frank's death are somewhat unusual.
then, I would imagine that the police would be more help than I.
Frank belonged to this church. Who officiated at his funeral?
perhaps I could ask him if he remembers any of Frank's friends that came.
why, surely. It's no problem at all.
what year was it? - 1969. He died September 30th.
let's have a look.
here we are. F. A. Saunders.
Ah, yes. It's Father Barnaby's signature. - Could you give me his address?
Yes. It's 3990 Mount Street, Melbourne. He was transferred there four months ago.
I'd be glad to write him a letter. He's a very nice man.
I'm sure he'll answer right away. - Thank you.
it's one's duty to help one's fellow Christian. I'll get off a note today and as soon as I have a reply I'll be sure to let... I'd better take your address.
don't bother, it's too complicated. - Why don't you write him directly?
I could give you a letter of introduction. - It's not important. I just wanted to talk to him if he was around. - Oh, Mister. Just a moment.
I'd be pleased if you'd accept this offering from our church.
if you care to attend one of our services, well, you'll be more than welcome.
you see, today, even those representing God must rely on advertising.
ancient Greece, nine letters...
how about Acropolis?
no, no. It can't be Acropolis. Second letter's gotta be a "c."
you spell Acropolis with a "c."
the drink's over here. The ice is in the kitchen.
and don't throw the ash on the floor until the maid comes tomorrow.
where are you planning on going? - I'll pick up my child from the school.
could you ask your husband to do that? - But I don't know where to find him.
unfortunately, we have orders not to let you go out.
isn't there anyone else you might ask? A relative? Maybe a friend?
palmieri, come here!
here's your mother. You ready? - That's not her. That's my Aunt Maria.
they're twins? How do you tell them apart? - Easy. You can tell by their car.
my Mother's got a Fulvia Coupé, and Aunt Maria has a Mini.
Alessandro! - Ciao, Maria!
I forgot to by newspapers for Mommy. Go on upstairs! - Okay.
thank you.
No!
Oh, no! I'm going out of my mind just thinking about it.
that you're the only one left? You're wrong.
Anna Sartori's alive and well. - She's alive?
Yes. He killed her twin sister, Maria. Easy to get confused, they're so alike.
but they wrote that Anna had been killed. - To protect her.
how did you get to know all this? - I talked to Vismara this morning.
did you tell him what you found out about Saunders?
Why? You and Anna aren't safe until the killer's been put away.
I'm tired of pretending to be a live corpse!
listen.
maybe there's a way to finish this thing once and for all.
it's risky. But it's the only way.
Oh boy! What a scoop! - Yeah! This is gonna be a scoop!
let's just hope that information I got was right.
here he comes! - Wait a minute!
go on!
Mario!
it came out today that Giulia Gerosa, the supposed third victim of the killer known as The Half Moon Maniac, is alive. Apparently, Mrs. Gerosa was only wounded and has since completely recovered.
Hello?
Hello!
now she'll sleep until morning. By then, the shock will have subsided.
damned! I broke the window. That's what made her faint.
well, these things... - Well?
nothing. We've been over the whole area thoroughly and didn't find a thing.
I'm afraid that we got there too late. The same with Marchi and de Rosa.
well, apart from a scare, nothing very serious happened to your wife.
that, I agree. But the trap failed and the murderer got away again.
even with the whole place surrounded he had no trouble at all evading us.
it wasn't worth taking the risk.
I think you're wrong. Have a look at this.
our little plan didn't fail completely. This time he made a fundamental error.
listen!
line's connected. - He blocked the line, hoping to prevent your wife calling for help. But we have a tap in this telephone.
I can find out where he made his call from.
you know the murderer's phone number? - Yes, we have the name and address.
it corresponds with what you told me. Come along.
it's on the first floor, Inspector. But no one answers. And the door's locked.
alright. Break it down! - What? Without a search warrant, Sir?
Yes. I'll get one tomorrow. Hurry up!
that's where I wrote the message. On the poster, there.
inspector!
police Headquarters. But you hold on a second.
you got any idea how much longer he'll be? - The district attorney is very picky.
we might not finish until midnight. You'll just have to have a little patience.
Oh yeah. Patience. It's more than just a virtue in a police station.
Ah, here he is!
the case is closed. Here's a photo stat of Doctor Harris's report.
and this here confirms the report.
it's the hotel my wife owned.
september 29th. The place is right and the date is right.
"what's this? "I've found real love here. Goodbye, Frank.
and it's addressed to New York. - Good point.
Barrett goes back to Italy this year in January and finds out that Saunders is dead. He reads the date and cause of death in Dr Harris's report:
wilful negligence. - So, that's why Harris said the girl killed Saunders. - Already a girl that he had it in for, because she'd stolen Frank. From now on, in his eyes, she was a killer.
Barrett must have been out of his mind. - That's one thing you can always be sure of. All criminals are out of their minds.
the girl was an unknown quantity for Barrett. The only thing he knew, was at the hotel that Frank met her. He goes up there and he talks to someone.
he learns about the proprietor's daughter and the maid, Tambourini, who was then employed there. And there was the page in the register for September 29th. The proprietress, the maid and the client.
the girl he was after was one of those 6. 7, actually. But one of them was dead.
so he decided to do in all of them. - And then he committed suicide.
Bravo, Palumbo. - Inspector?
what I still find incomprehensible is, what were the half moons for?
a maniac's fetish. - My impression is that they were some sort of trade mark. And I don't understand this: Barrett took drugs.
how could anyone, in this condition, prepare and then commit all those murders the way he did? - He wasn't under the influence of drugs.
don't think about it anymore. His suicide was his confession.
inspector Vismara? - Ah, good morning. How are you?
this is Signore Palmieri, Anna's husband. Gerosa.
is it really over? Can we relax now? - Yes. The whole thing's finished.
thank God. After the death of her sister my wife had a nervous breakdown.
and after two years of trying to help her, God only knows what I'm going to do now.
good evening. - Signore Palmieri isn't in.
I'd like to speak to Signora, if I may. - Signora isn't receiving. - Police.
don't you policemen ever go home to bed?
Signora, there's a policeman here for you. - Come on up!
Signora.
what is it this time? Can't you ever leave me in peace?
this is rather important and could very well be beneficial to us both.
so, you're not from the police? - I'm married to Giulia Torresi, the proprietor of the hotel where you stayed two years ago.
do you remember? - Yes, but I don't understand.
my wife was on that murderer's list. Just the same as you were on it.
but, it's all over now. That man committed suicide, didn't he?
sure. If that guy really was the murderer.
what do you mean? - Oh, nothing.
you were in a car accident two years ago, right?
I don't have to answer. - You remember Frank Saunders?
he died in a car crash. The same car crash that you were in.
you must be mad. I don't know any Frank Saunders. Get out of here!
how about this? Do you recognise it? A perfect twin of the one that belonged to Frank Saunders. You used it on the morning of the accident.
you were at the wheel. And afterwards you got scared and split, while he lay there, bleeding to death. Right? You ran!
stop it, will you? It wasn't my fault! I didn't want him to die!
he loved me. He wanted to take me to the States. But how could I?
I'm a married woman with a child.
and that's why you ran off and abandoned him.
my husband didn't know anything. I had to leave Frank, to forget him.
please don't tell anything to the police! I'll do anything you want!
I'll give you money! - Look. Calm down, please.
I've got no intention of turning you in. And I'm not interested in money.
I just want you to please help me. - Help you? How can I?
by answering my questions. Four days ago, did you take seven orchids to Frank's grave? - No, I... I certainly didn't. Why?
the solution to the problem lies here, in this one small medallion.
there has to be a reason why the killer left one with each woman, right?
I don't understand. What do you mean? - This trinket could represent a bond between Frank and the killer. Can you recall if it was a gift from Barrett?
Barrett? No, I don't think so. It was a gift from someone,
I'm sure of that. But, I don't remember who.
give it a try. Think! It might hit you. Are Frank's parents alive?
no. He only had an older brother. - Well, do you know where he is?
I think he's in America. Yes, of course, now I remember.
it was his brother who gave him the key-ring.
did you know him at all? - No. But I saw photos of them together.
can you recall how he looked like? - Yes. They were a lot different.
you said the brother was older? - A couple of years, yes.
go on. Please, it's very important.
his brother looked more serious. He had a high forehead.
he and Frank were about the same size. But, what really struck me was his face.
he had a kind face. He was almost bald.
he had a thing... a cleft in his chin.
and he looked short-sighted, like he might need glasses.
Mario, I know you're here. Put on the record again.
Mario!
Mario?
Mario...
come on!
I don't know which one of you was driving that car.
it may have been one of the others, but then, of course, it may have been you!
so you, like the others, you must die.
so that Frank may rest in peace! - Barrett!
No! I needed to keep you all off my trail.
that's why Barrett had to die!
Giulia!
Mario!
Victor?
Victor, I need your help with something.
honey, I got water boiling.
dinner can wait.
want to help me out of this?
Whoo.
you get it hard on an old man, don't you?
I do, don't I?
Ugh.
how did I get so lucky?
you didn't.
I'm using you for sex.
I love you, Clara.
I love you more.
I'll be back in an hour.
where are you off to?
strawberries.
champagne.
don't you leave this bed.
uh.
Oh, my God, Leo.
what am I going to do?
did you kill your husband?!
no, I did not. I loved my husband.
if you're acquitted, you'll be a billionaire.
how does that make me feel?
my client has no comment.
what's it like sleeping alone now?
by the way, how was the sex?
get her inside.
what station are you from?
where are your credentials?
this is a public street in a free country.
I don't need credentials.
you're no journalist.
someone told you to ask those questions.
look. I'm just doing my job.
I think I can guess who for.
so, what are you getting off Mrs. Musso?
well, it's more sadness than guilt really.
well, the evidence is rock solid.
there's a partial print on a syringe containing cyanide.
there's no sign of forced entry in her apartment.
and she is the primary beneficiary of the will.
well, you got all that going for you, Crosby.
I mean, what do you need me for?
never underestimate the value of an expert witness.
doc, you wanna do this?
hello.
how was the sex?
Oh, hello, Zoe. Well it's been a long time.
what do you need? You need a reference?
I haven't had any trouble getting offers so far.
you sent one of your minions to ask vicious and personal questions to my client.
just so you could read her reactions on TV.
I can't hear you. No, can you say that again.
hear me now?
Oh.
clear as a bell.
counselor. - Counselor.
I'd like to speak with my ex-husband in private, if that's all right.
Absolutely.
I'd like an answer by the end of the business day, if you don't mind.
otherwise, I gotta go to Rayder Firm, and I don't really want to do that.
so, end of the day?
fair enough.
let me guess.
he wants you to be his expert witness?
Yep. Your client is hiding something, Zoe.
probably of a sexual nature, granted that is wishful thinking on my part.
but, you see how she's bringing that hand up to her face?
she's got a secret.
I will tear you apart on the stand, Cal. And you know it.
nice charm, that is.
so, you really think she didn't kill her husband?
Yes, I do.
what makes you so sure?
all the evidence is circumstantial.
and as for motive, there is none.
my client didn't want for anything.
it was a loving and faithful marriage.
she got an alibi?
uh.
how much is she paying you?
exactly what I'm worth.
well, drinks are on you then.
still... no alibi.
well, the trauma of finding her husband dead caused Clara to lose her memory for the 40 minutes between the last time she saw him alive and when she discovered his body.
look at it. I mean, really.
she is pushing those tears out, she is.
I mean, she's faking it.
we both know that this "science" of yours has a serious margin for error.
and it just won't cut it in a court of law.
and what will?
tears for a dead husband that left her $1. 2 billion?
I know why you're doing this.
and you're not going to get under my skin.
or my skirt.
you know that's a lie, that is.
I mean the skin part.
is this funny to you? The most important case of my career?
I haven't even taken the bloody job yet, Zoe.
you know, unlike you, I don't need to have studied amazonian pigmies for 6 years to know that that's a lie.
you want me to do this. You do.
you don't know why you do. But you do.
did I say "serious margin for error"?
I was being generous.
or couldn't you tell.
you know, it's going to be a shame to disappoint you in the courtroom.
how can anyone think Clara killed her husband?
I've been friends with her for almost 10 years.
there's no way she could have done this.
gotta love how everyone comes out of the woodwork on cases like this.
well, they've gotta get their 15 minutes somehow.
by turning this woman's life into a circus.
Yeah. Well, we're all part of that circus now.
prosecution. Foster, you're prepping witnesses.
you two, you get jury watch.
you want us to read the jurors for the whole trial?
track 'em individually, see what makes them tick.
but then look at them as a group.
I want to know which way they're leaning.
you know, the leaders, the followers.
well go on.
you're not just doing this to push Zoe's buttons.
there's something else going on here.
this is about justice, Foster.
there's something else. Zoe-related.
justice for a murder victim.
by avoiding my question, you just answered it.
I just hope for all our sakes, you know what you're doing.
join the club.
6 of the jurors look convinced Clara is guilty just from the opening arguments.
you could see approval on their faces every time the prosecutor talked.
maybe. But these 2 are for the defense.
and they've already emerged as leaders.
jurors 6, 7, and 11 were looking at them the whole time,
gauging their reaction.
which way you two leaning?
maybe he wasn't dying fast enough for her.
I mean, the guy was 30 years older than she is.
so? - So...
it can affect the power dynamic.
imbalance of power in a relationship can lead to victimization.
Oh, that struck a nerve.
that's interesting.
studies show that the most successful marriages are the ones where husbands are at least 5 years older than their wives.
so, being with an older man broadens your horizons, does it?
I'm sure Clara learned a lot from Victor.
Yeah. I'm sure she did... about denture cream.
you see, you're not listening, again.
Loker, what Torres is saying is that she needs to be stimulated and challenged.
by experience.
so, who was this old fart then, eh?
I was talking about Clara.
Nah. You weren't.
you connected with a memory, which I proceeded to be little.
sorry about that.
Oh, you cannot sing the praises of older men and then not give up details.
watch me.
all right.
what? You couldn't take me one-on-one?
Nah. Been there, done that.
ow, Loker, let go!
I promise to play nice today.
last time you said that you left claw marks.
do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
that's not possible.
excuse me.
well, no one can tell the whole truth, your honor.
I mean, it's subjective. It's filtered through our own experiences.
and that's the real truth.
well, how about promising to be honest to the best of your ability?
now, you're talking.
please, be seated. - Thank you, your honor.
Dr. Lightman, your resume speaks for itself.
you're Oxford educated. You're a doctorate in psychology.
and you're a consultant for the FBI.
as you well know, the key question in this trial is where was Clara Musso the night her husband was murdered?
the defense wants us to believe that the trauma of finding her husband dead has left Mrs. Musso unable to recall the 40 minutes between leaving him and discovering his corpse.
Dr. Lightman, in your expert opinion,
does this claim of memory loss pass the sniff test?
no.
could you elaborate?
Yeah.
it's been proven that some trauma
warfare, child abuse...
can cause memory loss.
do you have experience with such cases?
Yeah. Plenty.
I've worked with soldiers, rape victims.
memory loss is caused by degradation or abuse.
shock of a dead spouse, I mean, that'd be a first.
how about a shock of committing murder?
killers have been known to experience amnesia.
forensic psychologists call it red out.
how common is it to lie, claiming memory loss?
well, 9 out of 10 people claiming memory loss are lying.
why would they do that?
well, it's easier to say, "I can't remember." than tell the truth.
I have nothing further.
your witness, counselor.
Ahem.
permission to treat Dr. Lightman as a hostile witness?
granted. - Dr. Lightman!
I'm sorry. Won't happen again, Your Honor.
thank you.
Dr. Lightman was born hostile.
he also happens to be my ex-husband.
guilty as charged.
but, you know, it was my loss.
cause truly she is an angel.
the prosecution has touted your credentials, Dr. Lightman.
are we to understand that you possess the gift of being able to distinguish between truth and lies?
no. No. 20 years of research is not a gift, is it?
you and I know, it's a bit of a curse, really.
indeed it was.
in fact, do you recall being jeered off the stage while keynoting the Harvard Global Psychology Conference in 2005?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I do. Yeah!
Yeah, and it's bonkers.
right? Because I could have sworn that they were cheering.
they called it pop psychology.
voodoo science.
I think it's because they're scared of me.
4 years ago when we were still married,
you accused my boss of sleeping with me.
the gloves are coming off now, eh?
Objection! Your honor, that's immaterial.
Dr. Lightman, last warning.
overruled.
didn't it come out eventually that my boss...
a man... was in fact gay?
Yeah. Yeah, it did.
Yeah. I was way off the mark on that one.
but I mean, I was jealous. I was young.
I was head over heels in love. You know.
by day I'm a scientist. But by night, I'm fallible.
I'm only human.
well, I'm not questioning your humanity.
and certainly not your fallibility.
Oh, that's a relief.
you are here because of your expertise in psychology and lying.
I'm challenging that.
your flagrant manipulation of the jury notwithstanding.
OK. But when you say that your client is innocent,
you don't fully believe that.
again, you misjudge my thoughts
because I know my client is innocent.
why don't you want to hear the science then?
your testimony is limited to scientific context not specific opinions on who's lying.
all right, well, you want to hear the whole truth?
that woman over there... your client...
the black widow over there...
control yourself!
when she says she doesn't know...
Dr. Lightman.
control yourself.
well, she's lying. And that's a fact.
control yourself or I will have the judge control you!
her? Do me a favor, look at her.
she's having a tough enough time controlling herself.
Marshall, please remove this witness before I hold him in contempt.
I mean, look at her. Bulging eyes, the guilt all over her face.
I think it's the booze.
get him out of here!
Oh. Hello, darling.
what?
I hope that was part of a careful plan in there.
Careful's for lawyers and accountants, right?
I think it's very interesting of her when I called her a black widow,
she got a little pout.
her feelings were hurt.
Really? - Surprising.
shocking, huh?
I'm heading back to the office to prep more witnesses.
you coming?
I'll catch up with you.
OK. Behave.
you're right.
Hey, you need a lawyer? No, I'm only joking.
what judge you got?
Denton. Why?
Oh, Denton. He's a complete softy.
he's a pushover.
he's a bleeding heart liberal, vegetarian.
I mean, the most you're looking at there is a slap on the wrist. Well done.
no. No. I didn't do anything. It was that guy.
he mugged my wife.
Really?
I'm sorry about that.
I mean, it's just luck of the draw.
I mean, keep your chin up.
that was my wife! That was my wife!
come on! Let me go!
shouldn't my lawyer be here if you're going to talk to me?
three's a crowd, love.
excuse me? - Don't get me wrong.
she's a terrific lawyer.
she's really top-notch. And I mean that.
seems there's a lot of chemistry there between you and your ex-wife.
well, there's a lot of chemistry in Chernobyl.
you know what's interesting, Dr. Lightman.
we both have something in common.
Oh yeah.
we both married up.
Hah.
you really miss him, do you?
Victor?
you're the expert.
when I say I loved my husband, what do you see?
well, you can love a man and kill him.
or have him killed.
look me in the eye and tell me you believe I killed my husband.
tell me about those 40 minutes you can't remember.
find whoever murdered Victor and I'll tell you whatever you want.
Oh, I see. You got someone in mind then.
Victor gave me more than I ever wanted.
we were partners in everything.
all the charities.
I converted to catholicism so I could share that with him too.
why would I end that?
what the hell is going on?!
I'm tampering with your client.
are you always this relentless?
to the point of self-destruction. Officer!
you wanted your father's money, didn't you?!
you were desperate and you wanted his money so, you framed your stepmother.
the hell I did! That's crazy!
see, that's wrong.
I mean the worst thing you can do is match your questioner's intensity.
instead give a firm, deliberate answer.
here, watch.
the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.
you lie!
it's not true.
the president clenches his jaw, slight hints of anger, but then he modulates his voice and folds his hands. Ok.
now, Mr O'Sullivan, did you murder Victor Musso?
certainly not.
good. Simple. Direct.
truthful.
see, I know how to handle myself under pressure, Dr Foster.
I was Vic's right hand for 25 years.
riding his coattails for 25 years.
I was CFO for a "Fortune 500" company.
one last tip.
women require more eye contact than men to feel a connection.
so, I want you both to focus your attention on the female jurors.
got it?
anything to put that gold-digger away.
where was that loyalty when your father was alive?
Hey, she came onto me, ok?!
well, since it was my client you illegally tampered with,
judge Quinn has given me the authority to either keep you in here or release you.
Oh yeah? You bought her a drink or then?
give me one good reason I should let you out of here.
one good reason, all right.
Yeah. Just one. - Well...
how about you need me?
you know, a room like this in our house could have saved our marriage.
goodbye, Cal.
your client's innocent, by the way.
I found out while I was tampering with her.
think I'll take a nap.
don't pretend you don't need my help, Cal.
why do you do it?
do what?
you know, keep forcing us together like this.
paging Dr Kinsey.
do you want to switch to my side?
what? And stop all this fun we're having here?
you must be joking.
the fact of the matter is, your client's innocent and the jury are about to convict her.
no, they're not. - Yeah, they are.
please.
fair enough. You're the boss.
stop it.
a little role playing never hurt anyone.
I should let you rot in here.
can't argue with you there, darling.
Marshall, here's the authorization for what I'm sure will be a huge mistake.
Clara didn't care about me.
she didn't care about my father.
she just wanted his money.
all right, let's pretend the jury's watching. Ok?
now, tell them exactly how Clara seduced you.
Ah, it was a week after she had interviewed my dad about the clinics he built in Africa.
and she was at our ranch.
I didn't know that they had already become involved.
she wanted a tour.
I was showing her the wine cellar.
and that's when it happened.
all right. That was good eye contact and posture, Damien.
but remember, fold your hands to avoid fidgeting.
got it.
how many times did you have sex?
maybe 6 or 7.
then maybe undercuts your credibility with the jurors.
especially with these 2.
all right.
give them a specific number.
7
but when she found out that I didn't have any money and that it was all in a trust until I was 40, she dumped me. The next thing I know, she's engaged to my father.
and he is changing his will.
where was the last place you and Clara had sex?
I don't know. They all kind of run together.
let's get some caffeine. You know, it always helps me focus.
so, tell me what happened in the wine cellar.
I was showing her my dad's collection, and she asked to see my belt buckle.
and you took it off or did she?
she did.
help yourself.
all right, you just watch the images.
and we'll monitor your reactions on the outside.
give me the finger.
Ah, that's charming, isn't it?
are you this hands-on with all your clients?
well, I'm not afraid to get a little dirty when necessary.
hmm.
all right, so you...
say you didn't kill your husband.
I believe you're innocent.
well, I can't say this feels like a vote of confidence.
well, you still don't remember what happened that night, so, a few faces from the case might jog your memory.
have fun.
how is this supposed to help jog her memory?
it's not. It's nonsense.
but since she's lying to us about those 40 minutes, we're coming at it from another angle.
Oh, flag that one.
contempt when she looks at Damien.
well, your stepson says you're sleeping together the same time you're bedding daddy... that can bring contempt.
Yeah, and in my country, a new member of the royal family.
flag that one.
push in on her hand.
Ooh.
who's that woman she's reacting to?
that's Tanya Wilson. It's a close friend of Clara's.
she comes to court every day to support her.
well, that hand closing like that... is anger.
what happened in the 40 minutes you left Victor?
what... I... I don't remember.
that's bullocks, Clara.
do you know who killed your husband?
you know I don't. - That's enough, Cal.
too right it is.
you're lying. I can't help ya.
uncooperative witness... that's common.
uncooperative client... that's rare.
well, Crosby hired us as experts.
can't you just tell her you're sure she didn't do it?
it's a matter of pride for Crosby at this point.
you know, what passes for truth in a courtroom isn't necessarily the whole truth.
I love you too.
out.
Clara was trying to hide her anger toward Tanya.
Yeah, I need some background on that one.
right. And we saw Clara's contempt for Damien.
what does she say about her affair with him?
she's adamant it never happened.
Damien came onto her. She said no.
it's he said, she said.
when I was prepping him, I asked them about their last sexual encounter, and he just stood there holding a pot of coffee.
I mean, he couldn't fill his cup while giving the details.
manual tasks are harder to integrate when you're faking a story.
Yeah, but I believed him the first time around.
what if his story is an obsessive fantasy?
if he played it out in his head enough, he could have said it really happened without showing any signs of deception.
so, Clara rejects Damien for his father, who's shadow he lives in.
it could have driven him to murder.
we need to get Damien back in here.
now, that's dangerous.
hmm.
you think I need more prep work before I testify?
there are a few more techniques Dr. Lightman wants to go over.
anything for my father.
you slut.
that's pure science. How was it?
all right, come on.
Damien! Damien, you lied!
you were never involved with Clara were you?
she seduced me!
you're pathetic, Damien.
you're pathetic!
how could you do this?!
we wanted to see how angry it made you to see her with somebody else.
you think I killed my father?!
no. No. But you've been lying about an innocent woman.
she is a gold-digger!
how can you say that?!
this was your plan all along!
I loved your father more than anything!
no, you used him! You wanted...
Ohh! Whoa. Whoa! Whoa!
Hey!
let's go!
let it go.
fair enough.
I expected a little bit more than a slap from the world's most notorious murder suspect.
Yeah. Well, I guess I've been respectable for too long.
I think I can help you with that.
Hey, doc, Damien Musso called my office this morning.
he said you all but accused him of murder.
well, Clara didn't kill her husband, right?
I see. You switched sides.
I mean, how can I compete with legs, cleavage & associates.
you can't.
Hah.
you know that affair Damien said he had with Clara?
he was lying. Call him to the stand. It's perjury.
we had a contract, doc.
look, I render my services as an expert.
we prepped your witnesses for ya. We read your jury. Job done.
well, it's going to be a long time before you get any business from my office.
I'm devastated.
Really? - Yeah.
I'll see you in there, counselor.
that's interesting.
what?
he's not worried at all about Damien.
and, uh, he doesn't give a toss about me coming over to the other side.
if anything, he's more confident than usual.
he's up to something.
Mr. O'Sullivan, why did you hire a private investigator to look into Clara's past?
I'd been friends with Victor since we were 10 years old in catechism at St. Bernard's.
when I realized Victor was getting serious about Clara,
I wanted to make sure her intentions were sincere as a friend first and as a business partner.
and did the investigator find anything criminal?
no. She reinvented herself though.
new name. New hair color. New resume.
well, breaking with the past isn't always easy.
to your knowledge, was Victor happy in his marriage?
Yes. But he didn't have all the facts.
reviewing the estate yesterday, I discovered something...
objection, Your Honor. Any information he has about the estate should have been brought forth in deposition.
are you certain that you made the discovery yesterday?
Yes. I'm certain.
no, he's lying, Your Honor.
he's been sitting on it. So has the D. A.
that's absurd.
your Honor, I move to clear the whole gallery.
muzzle your ex, Ms. Landau, or I will.
proceed with your finding.
when I looked at Victor's sub-accounts,
I discovered monthly withdrawals of roughly $90, 000, spread across the last year and a half.
Clara was stealing from him.
he's not lying.
motion for recess, Your Honor.
I need time to research these claims.
you can recall the witness when prosecution rests, Ms. Landau.
you're leaving?
Yeah. That jury's 12 to nothing to convict.
you're screwed.
so, if Clara stole money from her husband, why did we switch sides.
Lightman screwed up?
well, Foster always says, the closer you are to someone emotionally, the harder it is to get a true read.
Yeah, but Clara is a stranger.
Zoe isn't. Anything she touches, Lightman is going to bring baggage to it.
Hey, speaking of baggage, you want to unload some of your own, like that memory that Lightman saw?
Loker. - What?
what kind of age difference are we talking about here? 10 years?
we're not discussing this.
did you violate state laws or something?
no.
decency laws?
it was a totally legal and healthy relationship.
that's exciting. Come on. Give me something.
what are you hiding? At least give me his name.
Denise Watson.
Tanya Wilson, as I live and breathe.
Clara's best mate.
Why's she so angry with you then?
I didn't know that she was.
Really?! How long have you two been friends?
I don't have to talk to you.
that's true. That's true.
but I'll see to that while you explain to a jury why you got so scared when Leo testified that Clara was stealing from her husband.
I was scared for Clara as a friend.
Ahh. Were you two in it together?
were your robbing the old man blind.
as I was going through a tough time. Clara was helping me out.
see, there's that fear again.
I think you're hiding something.
I think you're here just to make sure she keeps her mouth shut.
ridiculous.
I smell blackmail.
of a sexual variety. What is it?
is it you and Clara?
you and Victor?
no, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. Three's a crowd, right?
you and Victor and Clara.
what you got on him? You got photos?
you got video?
you got dirty knickers?
I had nothing to do with his death.
my money's on video.
I think you got a sex tape.
about 90 grand a month's worth.
Clara met him through me.
her life was supposed to be mine.
it's not like they were going to miss it.
well, thanks for that.
now, if you want to stay out of jail,
I'm gonna need that sex tape.
it was Vic's 60th birthday, and I wanted to do something he'd never forget.
in every other way he was conservative.
but this was a fantasy of his.
so, Tanya and I got together.
we were friends at that point or so I thought.
so, those 40 minutes that you claim you can't remember...
all right...
that's when you nipped out to pay off Tanya. Yeah?
it was meant to stop. But when I got there, she said that the were going to keep going.
but you couldn't tell your husband about the blackmail?
or your lawyer?
it would have confirmed everything that people had been saying about me.
and his reputation meant the world to him.
you're willing to go to jail to preserve that reputation?
true love.
I know. It's absolute insanity.
hmm.
I'm innocent, Zoe.
and I thought maybe you could somehow make the jury see that.
well, speaking of the jury, we've been reading them, and they're 12 to nothing to convict.
I mean, it's one thing to say you're innocent.
but, you gotta show them who's guilty.
well, we know we can rule out Damien.
who else has access to your house?
the only other person with a key was Leo.
he just smeared you in court.
I was stealing.
he stands to benefit financially if you're convicted.
he's the executor of the estate.
there is no way. Vic and Leo were more than business partners.
they were like brothers.
Yeah, well so was Brutus and Caesar.
put me back on the stand again.
what?
just ask, Loker.
so, you sleep with women too?
Wow.
you just went to a whole new level of blunt.
well, it has serious ramifications.
my competition may have just doubled.
I was curious, ok?
Denise was funny and interesting.
and I liked her smile.
Mm... hmm.
I didn't make a life choice.
right.
so, just to confirm.
not bisexual then.
it was experimenting, Loker.
OK.
and you know, why can girls do it and guys can't?
Where's the fantasy in that?
anyways, who really cares what people do in their bedrooms.
everyone.
so...
this experiment.
what were your findings?
you know, scientifically speaking.
you hold yourself out as an arbiter of people's honesty, yet time and again you've reversed yourself, Dr. Lightman.
Yeah. Yeah, well, scientists, see, they admit their mistakes.
ex-wives... that's an entirely different story.
the fact is your science is completely unreliable.
I mean, you're a glorified fortuneteller. A hack.
all right, well, let's see if the jury agrees, shall we?
the foreman, he's high as a kite, and he has been all along.
that one, she's getting off on Clara's misery, she is.
and those 2 over there, they're having an affair.
they're doing the dirty back at the hotel.
both of them married to different people.
and that one has got a serious foot fetish.
Dr. Lightman, for God's sake!
well, no. My point is I can read anyone here.
right. Not just the defendant or the judge.
if you're hiding something, I'll know it.
and yet you never turn that scrutiny on yourself, Dr. Lightman. Why is that?
that would terrify you, wouldn't it?
to be striped bare the way you strip the people around you.
I'm not a killer, counselor.
but neither is Clara Musso.
move to strike, Your Honor.
sustained.
the real killer has been hiding in plain sight all along.
he's in this very courtroom as we speak.
Objection! Speculation!
Dr. Lightman, this court has indulged you more than enough. Step down now, please.
please. Please step down before I have you arrested.
if you're gonna arrest somebody, you should arrest Leo O'Sullivan.
he killed his best friend, right, Leo?!
Marshall, remove him from the court.
you bastard! I didn't murder Vic. I'd never!
Oh, that's the truth, see. You didn't murder him, but you did kill him, didn't you?
all right. Dr. Lightman is out of court.
what does that mean...
Leo killed Victor but he didn't murder him?
well, when he said he didn't murder Victor, there was no sign of deception, right?
but when I asked him if he killed his friend, he flashed regret.
look, if I recall Leo to the stand...
we crack the case.
he's right on the edge. He just needs one more shove.
spit it out then.
well, since you asked. When is killing your friend a good thing?
please be seated.
I thought I kicked your ex-husband out of my courtroom, counselor?
Dr. Lightman is essential for my client's defense, Your Honor.
he's just here to observe.
he won't be a nuisance to the court.
well, if he is, he will be the guest of the county for the next 30 days.
are we clear, Dr. Lightman?
as a bell, Your Honor.
proceed.
Mr. O'Sullivan, I wish to remind you that you are still under oath.
I'd like to apologize for the previous outburst.
it's clear to me and to everyone in this courtroom how close you were to Victor Musso.
you were his best friend, his lifelong confidant.
and you would do anything to protect him.
and his reputation.
that's true.
I'd like to show the witness some photos, if I may.
Objection! - No. No. You can't.
there were no pictures submitted during discovery.
easy love, jury's watching.
sidebar, Your Honor?
please.
you can't let them see those pictures.
everything Vic worked for would be ruined.
if you try and stop this, I'll do those 30 days with bells on, just after I finish blurting it out to the jury.
these could do irreparable harm to the reputation of the deceased.
I don't know how this is germane to the case.
it speaks to the accusation that Clara was stealing from her husband.
I don't want to besmirch a good man if I don't have to.
but I do reserve the right to present these in open court.
I take your point, counselor.
all right. Please.
thank you.
you want to see Clara Musso locked up for murder.
she betrayed a man who loved her.
she was sleeping with his son for God sakes.
well, thanks to Dr. Lightman, that's been exposed as a lie.
she was stealing from him.
which you knew about. And yet you never said a word.
he was completely under her spell.
I was protecting him.
well, I submit to you that Clara was doing the same.
protecting him.
and the money you say my client was stealing from him was in fact being put to a good and noble cause.
am I being clear enough here, Mr. O'Sullivan?
perfectly, counselor.
you also knew she didn't kill her husband, sir.
but you thought she deserved to go to prison anyway, didn't you?
because after all, you had built a company and a reputation side-by-side with Victor for 25 years.
and overnight, your best friend became a different person.
Clara had displaced you.
No! When it mattered, Victor called me.
there we go. Watch this.
hold on to your seat, love.
like when it came to his health?
that's fear.
but without shame.
he's proud of what he did.
you didn't murder him, Leo.
he asked you to end his life, didn't he?
Objection!
overruled.
how was Mr. Musso's health just prior to his death?
you're under oath.
he was...
secretly very sick.
and that's why he wanted you to help him end his life, to assist his suicide. Isn't that right?
objection, your honor!
the court is very interested in Mr. O'Sullivan's answer.
he had a degenerative brain disease.
doctors gave him a month or two.
you bought the cyanide and the syringe.
he called you to his home.
and you gave him that injection, didn't you?
your honor! - Take your seat.
Victor was devout.
I mean, to him suicide was a mortal sin.
I couldn't say no to my friend.
which is why you never told him that Clara was stealing, because he was dying.
why break his heart on top of everything else?
do you have proof it wasn't a murder?
he left a video explaining.
now that right there.
that is shame.
I think his widow has a right to see that.
but I didn't imagine that I'd meet a woman who would understand me so completely.
our marriage was a gift, Clara.
happiest 10 years of my life.
I wouldn't let anything tarnish that.
Zoe says that Leo is pleading guilty to obstruction of justice and manslaughter.
and they're working out a deal.
that's good then.
thank you for everything.
I should have trusted you sooner.
well, I could say the same thing.
I've got a meeting waiting.
she's a beautiful woman.
she's my Leo.
what about Zoe?
well, to say you stopped loving someone you once loved more than anything else in the world, I mean that would be a lie.
but you move on.
don't you?
you have to move on.
she's my daughter's mum.
sometimes sparring partner.
any other women populating your life?
none you need to worry about.
I'm taking over Victor's businesses and charities.
Oh yeah?
people are going to come after me. They think I'm weak.
I need someone I can trust.
well, you got my number.
so to speak.
my point is, right, that the reason that we won was because the whole truth came out, which... no, cause it doesn't normally happen in a courtroom.
Mm-hmm.
why'd you take this case?
I thought it'd be a bit of fun.
that's not it. Not really.
well, it's your first time out there.
it's a big national case.
you were protecting me?
Oh, that's so sweet.
and paternalistic and patronizing.
Yeah. You got a point there. - Hmm.
no, but look. If you get a guilty woman off, you're a punch line.
if you convict an innocent man, you're a joke.
you've worked far too hard to get where you are.
you deserve a bit of respect.
not infamy.
still waiting for you to get what you deserve.
well, I'm 2 steps ahead of the hangman.
Emily's sleeping at a friend's.
what? The whole night?
all right. - I'll get the check.
Yeah.
Victor?
Victor, I need your help with something.
honey, I got water boiling.
dinner can wait.
want to help me out of this?
Whoo.
you get it hard on an old man, don't you?
I do, don't I?
Ugh.
how did I get so lucky?
you didn't.
I'm using you for sex.
I love you, Clara.
I love you more.
I'll be back in an hour.
where are you off to?
strawberries.
champagne.
don't you leave this bed.
uh.
Oh, my God, Leo.
what am I going to do?
did you kill your husband?!
no, I did not. I loved my husband.
if you're acquitted, you'll be a billionaire.
how does that make me feel?
my client has no comment.
what's it like sleeping alone now?
by the way, how was the sex?
get her inside.
what station are you from?
where are your credentials?
this is a public street in a free country.
I don't need credentials.
you're no journalist.
someone told you to ask those questions.
look. I'm just doing my job.
I think I can guess who for.
so, what are you getting off Mrs. Musso?
well, it's more sadness than guilt really.
well, the evidence is rock solid.
there's a partial print on a syringe containing cyanide.
there's no sign of forced entry in her apartment.
and she is the primary beneficiary of the will.
well, you got all that going for you, Crosby.
I mean, what do you need me for?
never underestimate the value of an expert witness.
doc, you wanna do this?
hello.
how was the sex?
Oh, hello, Zoe. Well it's been a long time.
what do you need? You need a reference?
I haven't had any trouble getting offers so far.
you sent one of your minions to ask vicious and personal questions to my client.
just so you could read her reactions on TV.
I can't hear you. No, can you say that again.
hear me now?
Oh.
clear as a bell.
counselor. - Counselor.
I'd like to speak with my ex-husband in private, if that's all right.
Absolutely.
I'd like an answer by the end of the business day, if you don't mind.
otherwise, I gotta go to Rayder Firm, and I don't really want to do that.
so, end of the day?
fair enough.
let me guess.
he wants you to be his expert witness?
Yep. Your client is hiding something, Zoe.
probably of a sexual nature, granted that is wishful thinking on my part.
but, you see how she's bringing that hand up to her face?
she's got a secret.
I will tear you apart on the stand, Cal. And you know it.
nice charm, that is.
so, you really think she didn't kill her husband?
Yes, I do.
what makes you so sure?
all the evidence is circumstantial.
and as for motive, there is none.
my client didn't want for anything.
it was a loving and faithful marriage.
she got an alibi?
uh.
how much is she paying you?
exactly what I'm worth.
well, drinks are on you then.
still... no alibi.
well, the trauma of finding her husband dead caused Clara to lose her memory for the 40 minutes between the last time she saw him alive and when she discovered his body.
look at it. I mean, really.
she is pushing those tears out, she is.
I mean, she's faking it.
we both know that this "science" of yours has a serious margin for error.
and it just won't cut it in a court of law.
and what will?
tears for a dead husband that left her $1. 2 billion?
I know why you're doing this.
and you're not going to get under my skin.
or my skirt.
you know that's a lie, that is.
I mean the skin part.
is this funny to you? The most important case of my career?
I haven't even taken the bloody job yet, Zoe.
you know, unlike you, I don't need to have studied amazonian pigmies for 6 years to know that that's a lie.
you want me to do this. You do.
you don't know why you do. But you do.
did I say "serious margin for error"?
I was being generous.
or couldn't you tell.
you know, it's going to be a shame to disappoint you in the courtroom.
how can anyone think Clara killed her husband?
I've been friends with her for almost 10 years.
there's no way she could have done this.
gotta love how everyone comes out of the woodwork on cases like this.
well, they've gotta get their 15 minutes somehow.
by turning this woman's life into a circus.
Yeah. Well, we're all part of that circus now.
prosecution. Foster, you're prepping witnesses.
you two, you get jury watch.
you want us to read the jurors for the whole trial?
track 'em individually, see what makes them tick.
but then look at them as a group.
I want to know which way they're leaning.
you know, the leaders, the followers.
well go on.
you're not just doing this to push Zoe's buttons.
there's something else going on here.
this is about justice, Foster.
there's something else. Zoe-related.
justice for a murder victim.
by avoiding my question, you just answered it.
I just hope for all our sakes, you know what you're doing.
join the club.
6 of the jurors look convinced Clara is guilty just from the opening arguments.
you could see approval on their faces every time the prosecutor talked.
maybe. But these 2 are for the defense.
and they've already emerged as leaders.
jurors 6, 7, and 11 were looking at them the whole time,
gauging their reaction.
which way you two leaning?
maybe he wasn't dying fast enough for her.
I mean, the guy was 30 years older than she is.
so? - So...
it can affect the power dynamic.
imbalance of power in a relationship can lead to victimization.
Oh, that struck a nerve.
that's interesting.
studies show that the most successful marriages are the ones where husbands are at least 5 years older than their wives.
so, being with an older man broadens your horizons, does it?
I'm sure Clara learned a lot from Victor.
Yeah. I'm sure she did... about denture cream.
you see, you're not listening, again.
Loker, what Torres is saying is that she needs to be stimulated and challenged.
by experience.
so, who was this old fart then, eh?
I was talking about Clara.
Nah. You weren't.
you connected with a memory, which I proceeded to be little.
sorry about that.
Oh, you cannot sing the praises of older men and then not give up details.
watch me.
all right.
what? You couldn't take me one-on-one?
Nah. Been there, done that.
ow, Loker, let go!
I promise to play nice today.
last time you said that you left claw marks.
do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
that's not possible.
excuse me.
well, no one can tell the whole truth, your honor.
I mean, it's subjective. It's filtered through our own experiences.
and that's the real truth.
well, how about promising to be honest to the best of your ability?
now, you're talking.
please, be seated. - Thank you, your honor.
Dr. Lightman, your resume speaks for itself.
you're Oxford educated. You're a doctorate in psychology.
and you're a consultant for the FBI.
as you well know, the key question in this trial is where was Clara Musso the night her husband was murdered?
the defense wants us to believe that the trauma of finding her husband dead has left Mrs. Musso unable to recall the 40 minutes between leaving him and discovering his corpse.
Dr. Lightman, in your expert opinion,
does this claim of memory loss pass the sniff test?
no.
could you elaborate?
Yeah.
it's been proven that some trauma
warfare, child abuse...
can cause memory loss.
do you have experience with such cases?
Yeah. Plenty.
I've worked with soldiers, rape victims.
memory loss is caused by degradation or abuse.
shock of a dead spouse, I mean, that'd be a first.
how about a shock of committing murder?
killers have been known to experience amnesia.
forensic psychologists call it red out.
how common is it to lie, claiming memory loss?
well, 9 out of 10 people claiming memory loss are lying.
why would they do that?
well, it's easier to say, "I can't remember." than tell the truth.
I have nothing further.
your witness, counselor.
Ahem.
permission to treat Dr. Lightman as a hostile witness?
granted. - Dr. Lightman!
I'm sorry. Won't happen again, Your Honor.
thank you.
Dr. Lightman was born hostile.
he also happens to be my ex-husband.
guilty as charged.
but, you know, it was my loss.
cause truly she is an angel.
the prosecution has touted your credentials, Dr. Lightman.
are we to understand that you possess the gift of being able to distinguish between truth and lies?
no. No. 20 years of research is not a gift, is it?
you and I know, it's a bit of a curse, really.
indeed it was.
in fact, do you recall being jeered off the stage while keynoting the Harvard Global Psychology Conference in 2005?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I do. Yeah!
Yeah, and it's bonkers.
right? Because I could have sworn that they were cheering.
they called it pop psychology.
voodoo science.
I think it's because they're scared of me.
4 years ago when we were still married,
you accused my boss of sleeping with me.
the gloves are coming off now, eh?
Objection! Your honor, that's immaterial.
Dr. Lightman, last warning.
overruled.
didn't it come out eventually that my boss...
a man... was in fact gay?
Yeah. Yeah, it did.
Yeah. I was way off the mark on that one.
but I mean, I was jealous. I was young.
I was head over heels in love. You know.
by day I'm a scientist. But by night, I'm fallible.
I'm only human.
well, I'm not questioning your humanity.
and certainly not your fallibility.
Oh, that's a relief.
you are here because of your expertise in psychology and lying.
I'm challenging that.
your flagrant manipulation of the jury notwithstanding.
OK. But when you say that your client is innocent,
you don't fully believe that.
again, you misjudge my thoughts
because I know my client is innocent.
why don't you want to hear the science then?
your testimony is limited to scientific context not specific opinions on who's lying.
all right, well, you want to hear the whole truth?
that woman over there... your client...
the black widow over there...
control yourself!
when she says she doesn't know...
Dr. Lightman.
control yourself.
well, she's lying. And that's a fact.
control yourself or I will have the judge control you!
her? Do me a favor, look at her.
she's having a tough enough time controlling herself.
Marshall, please remove this witness before I hold him in contempt.
I mean, look at her. Bulging eyes, the guilt all over her face.
I think it's the booze.
get him out of here!
Oh. Hello, darling.
what?
I hope that was part of a careful plan in there.
Careful's for lawyers and accountants, right?
I think it's very interesting of her when I called her a black widow,
she got a little pout.
her feelings were hurt.
Really? - Surprising.
shocking, huh?
I'm heading back to the office to prep more witnesses.
you coming?
I'll catch up with you.
OK. Behave.
you're right.
Hey, you need a lawyer? No, I'm only joking.
what judge you got?
Denton. Why?
Oh, Denton. He's a complete softy.
he's a pushover.
he's a bleeding heart liberal, vegetarian.
I mean, the most you're looking at there is a slap on the wrist. Well done.
no. No. I didn't do anything. It was that guy.
he mugged my wife.
Really?
I'm sorry about that.
I mean, it's just luck of the draw.
I mean, keep your chin up.
that was my wife! That was my wife!
come on! Let me go!
shouldn't my lawyer be here if you're going to talk to me?
three's a crowd, love.
excuse me? - Don't get me wrong.
she's a terrific lawyer.
she's really top-notch. And I mean that.
seems there's a lot of chemistry there between you and your ex-wife.
well, there's a lot of chemistry in Chernobyl.
you know what's interesting, Dr. Lightman.
we both have something in common.
Oh yeah.
we both married up.
Hah.
you really miss him, do you?
Victor?
you're the expert.
when I say I loved my husband, what do you see?
well, you can love a man and kill him.
or have him killed.
look me in the eye and tell me you believe I killed my husband.
tell me about those 40 minutes you can't remember.
find whoever murdered Victor and I'll tell you whatever you want.
Oh, I see. You got someone in mind then.
Victor gave me more than I ever wanted.
we were partners in everything.
all the charities.
I converted to catholicism so I could share that with him too.
why would I end that?
what the hell is going on?!
I'm tampering with your client.
are you always this relentless?
to the point of self-destruction. Officer!
you wanted your father's money, didn't you?!
you were desperate and you wanted his money so, you framed your stepmother.
the hell I did! That's crazy!
see, that's wrong.
I mean the worst thing you can do is match your questioner's intensity.
instead give a firm, deliberate answer.
here, watch.
the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.
you lie!
it's not true.
the president clenches his jaw, slight hints of anger, but then he modulates his voice and folds his hands. Ok.
now, Mr O'Sullivan, did you murder Victor Musso?
certainly not.
good. Simple. Direct.
truthful.
see, I know how to handle myself under pressure, Dr Foster.
I was Vic's right hand for 25 years.
riding his coattails for 25 years.
I was CFO for a "Fortune 500" company.
one last tip.
women require more eye contact than men to feel a connection.
so, I want you both to focus your attention on the female jurors.
got it?
anything to put that gold-digger away.
where was that loyalty when your father was alive?
Hey, she came onto me, ok?!
well, since it was my client you illegally tampered with,
judge Quinn has given me the authority to either keep you in here or release you.
Oh yeah? You bought her a drink or then?
give me one good reason I should let you out of here.
one good reason, all right.
Yeah. Just one. - Well...
how about you need me?
you know, a room like this in our house could have saved our marriage.
goodbye, Cal.
your client's innocent, by the way.
I found out while I was tampering with her.
think I'll take a nap.
don't pretend you don't need my help, Cal.
why do you do it?
do what?
you know, keep forcing us together like this.
paging Dr Kinsey.
do you want to switch to my side?
what? And stop all this fun we're having here?
you must be joking.
the fact of the matter is, your client's innocent and the jury are about to convict her.
no, they're not. - Yeah, they are.
please.
fair enough. You're the boss.
stop it.
a little role playing never hurt anyone.
I should let you rot in here.
can't argue with you there, darling.
Marshall, here's the authorization for what I'm sure will be a huge mistake.
Clara didn't care about me.
she didn't care about my father.
she just wanted his money.
all right, let's pretend the jury's watching. Ok?
now, tell them exactly how Clara seduced you.
Ah, it was a week after she had interviewed my dad about the clinics he built in Africa.
and she was at our ranch.
I didn't know that they had already become involved.
she wanted a tour.
I was showing her the wine cellar.
and that's when it happened.
all right. That was good eye contact and posture, Damien.
but remember, fold your hands to avoid fidgeting.
got it.
how many times did you have sex?
maybe 6 or 7.
then maybe undercuts your credibility with the jurors.
especially with these 2.
all right.
give them a specific number.
7
but when she found out that I didn't have any money and that it was all in a trust until I was 40, she dumped me. The next thing I know, she's engaged to my father.
and he is changing his will.
where was the last place you and Clara had sex?
I don't know. They all kind of run together.
let's get some caffeine. You know, it always helps me focus.
so, tell me what happened in the wine cellar.
I was showing her my dad's collection, and she asked to see my belt buckle.
and you took it off or did she?
she did.
help yourself.
all right, you just watch the images.
and we'll monitor your reactions on the outside.
give me the finger.
Ah, that's charming, isn't it?
are you this hands-on with all your clients?
well, I'm not afraid to get a little dirty when necessary.
hmm.
all right, so you...
say you didn't kill your husband.
I believe you're innocent.
well, I can't say this feels like a vote of confidence.
well, you still don't remember what happened that night, so, a few faces from the case might jog your memory.
have fun.
how is this supposed to help jog her memory?
it's not. It's nonsense.
but since she's lying to us about those 40 minutes, we're coming at it from another angle.
Oh, flag that one.
contempt when she looks at Damien.
well, your stepson says you're sleeping together the same time you're bedding daddy... that can bring contempt.
Yeah, and in my country, a new member of the royal family.
flag that one.
push in on her hand.
Ooh.
who's that woman she's reacting to?
that's Tanya Wilson. It's a close friend of Clara's.
she comes to court every day to support her.
well, that hand closing like that... is anger.
what happened in the 40 minutes you left Victor?
what... I... I don't remember.
that's bullocks, Clara.
do you know who killed your husband?
you know I don't. - That's enough, Cal.
too right it is.
you're lying. I can't help ya.
uncooperative witness... that's common.
uncooperative client... that's rare.
well, Crosby hired us as experts.
can't you just tell her you're sure she didn't do it?
it's a matter of pride for Crosby at this point.
you know, what passes for truth in a courtroom isn't necessarily the whole truth.
I love you too.
out.
Clara was trying to hide her anger toward Tanya.
Yeah, I need some background on that one.
right. And we saw Clara's contempt for Damien.
what does she say about her affair with him?
she's adamant it never happened.
Damien came onto her. She said no.
it's he said, she said.
when I was prepping him, I asked them about their last sexual encounter, and he just stood there holding a pot of coffee.
I mean, he couldn't fill his cup while giving the details.
manual tasks are harder to integrate when you're faking a story.
Yeah, but I believed him the first time around.
what if his story is an obsessive fantasy?
if he played it out in his head enough, he could have said it really happened without showing any signs of deception.
so, Clara rejects Damien for his father, who's shadow he lives in.
it could have driven him to murder.
we need to get Damien back in here.
now, that's dangerous.
hmm.
you think I need more prep work before I testify?
there are a few more techniques Dr. Lightman wants to go over.
anything for my father.
you slut.
that's pure science. How was it?
all right, come on.
Damien! Damien, you lied!
you were never involved with Clara were you?
she seduced me!
you're pathetic, Damien.
you're pathetic!
how could you do this?!
we wanted to see how angry it made you to see her with somebody else.
you think I killed my father?!
no. No. But you've been lying about an innocent woman.
she is a gold-digger!
how can you say that?!
this was your plan all along!
I loved your father more than anything!
no, you used him! You wanted...
Ohh! Whoa. Whoa! Whoa!
Hey!
let's go!
let it go.
fair enough.
I expected a little bit more than a slap from the world's most notorious murder suspect.
Yeah. Well, I guess I've been respectable for too long.
I think I can help you with that.
Hey, doc, Damien Musso called my office this morning.
he said you all but accused him of murder.
well, Clara didn't kill her husband, right?
I see. You switched sides.
I mean, how can I compete with legs, cleavage & associates.
you can't.
Hah.
you know that affair Damien said he had with Clara?
he was lying. Call him to the stand. It's perjury.
we had a contract, doc.
look, I render my services as an expert.
we prepped your witnesses for ya. We read your jury. Job done.
well, it's going to be a long time before you get any business from my office.
I'm devastated.
Really? - Yeah.
I'll see you in there, counselor.
that's interesting.
what?
he's not worried at all about Damien.
and, uh, he doesn't give a toss about me coming over to the other side.
if anything, he's more confident than usual.
he's up to something.
Mr. O'Sullivan, why did you hire a private investigator to look into Clara's past?
I'd been friends with Victor since we were 10 years old in catechism at St. Bernard's.
when I realized Victor was getting serious about Clara,
I wanted to make sure her intentions were sincere as a friend first and as a business partner.
and did the investigator find anything criminal?
no. She reinvented herself though.
new name. New hair color. New resume.
well, breaking with the past isn't always easy.
to your knowledge, was Victor happy in his marriage?
Yes. But he didn't have all the facts.
reviewing the estate yesterday, I discovered something...
objection, Your Honor. Any information he has about the estate should have been brought forth in deposition.
are you certain that you made the discovery yesterday?
Yes. I'm certain.
no, he's lying, Your Honor.
he's been sitting on it. So has the D. A.
that's absurd.
your Honor, I move to clear the whole gallery.
muzzle your ex, Ms. Landau, or I will.
proceed with your finding.
when I looked at Victor's sub-accounts,
I discovered monthly withdrawals of roughly $90, 000, spread across the last year and a half.
Clara was stealing from him.
he's not lying.
motion for recess, Your Honor.
I need time to research these claims.
you can recall the witness when prosecution rests, Ms. Landau.
you're leaving?
Yeah. That jury's 12 to nothing to convict.
you're screwed.
so, if Clara stole money from her husband, why did we switch sides.
Lightman screwed up?
well, Foster always says, the closer you are to someone emotionally, the harder it is to get a true read.
Yeah, but Clara is a stranger.
Zoe isn't. Anything she touches, Lightman is going to bring baggage to it.
Hey, speaking of baggage, you want to unload some of your own, like that memory that Lightman saw?
Loker. - What?
what kind of age difference are we talking about here? 10 years?
we're not discussing this.
did you violate state laws or something?
no.
decency laws?
it was a totally legal and healthy relationship.
that's exciting. Come on. Give me something.
what are you hiding? At least give me his name.
Denise Watson.
Tanya Wilson, as I live and breathe.
Clara's best mate.
Why's she so angry with you then?
I didn't know that she was.
Really?! How long have you two been friends?
I don't have to talk to you.
that's true. That's true.
but I'll see to that while you explain to a jury why you got so scared when Leo testified that Clara was stealing from her husband.
I was scared for Clara as a friend.
Ahh. Were you two in it together?
were your robbing the old man blind.
as I was going through a tough time. Clara was helping me out.
see, there's that fear again.
I think you're hiding something.
I think you're here just to make sure she keeps her mouth shut.
ridiculous.
I smell blackmail.
of a sexual variety. What is it?
is it you and Clara?
you and Victor?
no, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. Three's a crowd, right?
you and Victor and Clara.
what you got on him? You got photos?
you got video?
you got dirty knickers?
I had nothing to do with his death.
my money's on video.
I think you got a sex tape.
about 90 grand a month's worth.
Clara met him through me.
her life was supposed to be mine.
it's not like they were going to miss it.
well, thanks for that.
now, if you want to stay out of jail,
I'm gonna need that sex tape.
it was Vic's 60th birthday, and I wanted to do something he'd never forget.
in every other way he was conservative.
but this was a fantasy of his.
so, Tanya and I got together.
we were friends at that point or so I thought.
so, those 40 minutes that you claim you can't remember...
all right...
that's when you nipped out to pay off Tanya. Yeah?
it was meant to stop. But when I got there, she said that the were going to keep going.
but you couldn't tell your husband about the blackmail?
or your lawyer?
it would have confirmed everything that people had been saying about me.
and his reputation meant the world to him.
you're willing to go to jail to preserve that reputation?
true love.
I know. It's absolute insanity.
hmm.
I'm innocent, Zoe.
and I thought maybe you could somehow make the jury see that.
well, speaking of the jury, we've been reading them, and they're 12 to nothing to convict.
I mean, it's one thing to say you're innocent.
but, you gotta show them who's guilty.
well, we know we can rule out Damien.
who else has access to your house?
the only other person with a key was Leo.
he just smeared you in court.
I was stealing.
he stands to benefit financially if you're convicted.
he's the executor of the estate.
there is no way. Vic and Leo were more than business partners.
they were like brothers.
Yeah, well so was Brutus and Caesar.
put me back on the stand again.
what?
just ask, Loker.
so, you sleep with women too?
Wow.
you just went to a whole new level of blunt.
well, it has serious ramifications.
my competition may have just doubled.
I was curious, ok?
Denise was funny and interesting.
and I liked her smile.
Mm... hmm.
I didn't make a life choice.
right.
so, just to confirm.
not bisexual then.
it was experimenting, Loker.
OK.
and you know, why can girls do it and guys can't?
Where's the fantasy in that?
anyways, who really cares what people do in their bedrooms.
everyone.
so...
this experiment.
what were your findings?
you know, scientifically speaking.
you hold yourself out as an arbiter of people's honesty, yet time and again you've reversed yourself, Dr. Lightman.
Yeah. Yeah, well, scientists, see, they admit their mistakes.
ex-wives... that's an entirely different story.
the fact is your science is completely unreliable.
I mean, you're a glorified fortuneteller. A hack.
all right, well, let's see if the jury agrees, shall we?
the foreman, he's high as a kite, and he has been all along.
that one, she's getting off on Clara's misery, she is.
and those 2 over there, they're having an affair.
they're doing the dirty back at the hotel.
both of them married to different people.
and that one has got a serious foot fetish.
Dr. Lightman, for God's sake!
well, no. My point is I can read anyone here.
right. Not just the defendant or the judge.
if you're hiding something, I'll know it.
and yet you never turn that scrutiny on yourself, Dr. Lightman. Why is that?
that would terrify you, wouldn't it?
to be striped bare the way you strip the people around you.
I'm not a killer, counselor.
but neither is Clara Musso.
move to strike, Your Honor.
sustained.
the real killer has been hiding in plain sight all along.
he's in this very courtroom as we speak.
Objection! Speculation!
Dr. Lightman, this court has indulged you more than enough. Step down now, please.
please. Please step down before I have you arrested.
if you're gonna arrest somebody, you should arrest Leo O'Sullivan.
he killed his best friend, right, Leo?!
Marshall, remove him from the court.
you bastard! I didn't murder Vic. I'd never!
Oh, that's the truth, see. You didn't murder him, but you did kill him, didn't you?
all right. Dr. Lightman is out of court.
what does that mean...
Leo killed Victor but he didn't murder him?
well, when he said he didn't murder Victor, there was no sign of deception, right?
but when I asked him if he killed his friend, he flashed regret.
look, if I recall Leo to the stand...
we crack the case.
he's right on the edge. He just needs one more shove.
spit it out then.
well, since you asked. When is killing your friend a good thing?
please be seated.
I thought I kicked your ex-husband out of my courtroom, counselor?
Dr. Lightman is essential for my client's defense, Your Honor.
he's just here to observe.
he won't be a nuisance to the court.
well, if he is, he will be the guest of the county for the next 30 days.
are we clear, Dr. Lightman?
as a bell, Your Honor.
proceed.
Mr. O'Sullivan, I wish to remind you that you are still under oath.
I'd like to apologize for the previous outburst.
it's clear to me and to everyone in this courtroom how close you were to Victor Musso.
you were his best friend, his lifelong confidant.
and you would do anything to protect him.
and his reputation.
that's true.
I'd like to show the witness some photos, if I may.
Objection! - No. No. You can't.
there were no pictures submitted during discovery.
easy love, jury's watching.
sidebar, Your Honor?
please.
you can't let them see those pictures.
everything Vic worked for would be ruined.
if you try and stop this, I'll do those 30 days with bells on, just after I finish blurting it out to the jury.
these could do irreparable harm to the reputation of the deceased.
I don't know how this is germane to the case.
it speaks to the accusation that Clara was stealing from her husband.
I don't want to besmirch a good man if I don't have to.
but I do reserve the right to present these in open court.
I take your point, counselor.
all right. Please.
thank you.
you want to see Clara Musso locked up for murder.
she betrayed a man who loved her.
she was sleeping with his son for God sakes.
well, thanks to Dr. Lightman, that's been exposed as a lie.
she was stealing from him.
which you knew about. And yet you never said a word.
he was completely under her spell.
I was protecting him.
well, I submit to you that Clara was doing the same.
protecting him.
and the money you say my client was stealing from him was in fact being put to a good and noble cause.
am I being clear enough here, Mr. O'Sullivan?
perfectly, counselor.
you also knew she didn't kill her husband, sir.
but you thought she deserved to go to prison anyway, didn't you?
because after all, you had built a company and a reputation side-by-side with Victor for 25 years.
and overnight, your best friend became a different person.
Clara had displaced you.
No! When it mattered, Victor called me.
there we go. Watch this.
hold on to your seat, love.
like when it came to his health?
that's fear.
but without shame.
he's proud of what he did.
you didn't murder him, Leo.
he asked you to end his life, didn't he?
Objection!
overruled.
how was Mr. Musso's health just prior to his death?
you're under oath.
he was...
secretly very sick.
and that's why he wanted you to help him end his life, to assist his suicide. Isn't that right?
objection, your honor!
the court is very interested in Mr. O'Sullivan's answer.
he had a degenerative brain disease.
doctors gave him a month or two.
you bought the cyanide and the syringe.
he called you to his home.
and you gave him that injection, didn't you?
your honor! - Take your seat.
Victor was devout.
I mean, to him suicide was a mortal sin.
I couldn't say no to my friend.
which is why you never told him that Clara was stealing, because he was dying.
why break his heart on top of everything else?
do you have proof it wasn't a murder?
he left a video explaining.
now that right there.
that is shame.
I think his widow has a right to see that.
but I didn't imagine that I'd meet a woman who would understand me so completely.
our marriage was a gift, Clara.
happiest 10 years of my life.
I wouldn't let anything tarnish that.
Zoe says that Leo is pleading guilty to obstruction of justice and manslaughter.
and they're working out a deal.
that's good then.
thank you for everything.
I should have trusted you sooner.
well, I could say the same thing.
I've got a meeting waiting.
she's a beautiful woman.
she's my Leo.
what about Zoe?
well, to say you stopped loving someone you once loved more than anything else in the world, I mean that would be a lie.
but you move on.
don't you?
you have to move on.
she's my daughter's mum.
sometimes sparring partner.
any other women populating your life?
none you need to worry about.
I'm taking over Victor's businesses and charities.
Oh yeah?
people are going to come after me. They think I'm weak.
I need someone I can trust.
well, you got my number.
so to speak.
my point is, right, that the reason that we won was because the whole truth came out, which... no, cause it doesn't normally happen in a courtroom.
Mm-hmm.
why'd you take this case?
I thought it'd be a bit of fun.
that's not it. Not really.
well, it's your first time out there.
it's a big national case.
you were protecting me?
Oh, that's so sweet.
and paternalistic and patronizing.
Yeah. You got a point there. - Hmm.
no, but look. If you get a guilty woman off, you're a punch line.
if you convict an innocent man, you're a joke.
you've worked far too hard to get where you are.
you deserve a bit of respect.
not infamy.
still waiting for you to get what you deserve.
well, I'm 2 steps ahead of the hangman.
Emily's sleeping at a friend's.
what? The whole night?
all right. - I'll get the check.
Yeah.
# Evening star is shining bright #
# So make a wish and hold on tight #
# There's magic in the air tonight #
# And anything can happen #
just in that moment, the ugly little frog looked up with his sad, round eyes and pleaded:
Oh, please, dear princess, only a kiss from you can break this terrible spell, that was inflicted on me by a wicked witch.
there comes my favorite part.
and the beautiful princess was so moved by his desperate plea, that she stooped down, picked up the slippery creature, leaned forward, raised him to her lips, and kissed that little frog.
then the frog was transformed into a handsome prince.
they were married and lived happily ever after.
the end.
Yay! Read it again, read it again!
sorry Charlotte, it's time for us to be headin' home.
say good night, Tiana.
there is no way, in this whole wide world...
I would ever, ever, ever I mean never kiss a frog. Yuck!

here comes your prince charming, Tia. Come on, kiss.
No! Stop it! - Yes, Yes!
I won't, I won't, I won't! - I would do it.
I would kiss a frog.
I would kiss a hundred frogs, if I could marry a prince and be a princess.

poor little thing.

Oh, no sugar come on. - I want that one.

Aah, now princess, you gettin' that drift but that's it.

Uuuh, that's smells good
you know the thing about good food?
it brings folks together from all walks of life.
it warms them right up and it puts little smiles on their faces.
and when I open up my own restaurant, I tell you, people are gonna lined up for miles around, just to get a taste of my food.
our food! - That's right, baby.
our food.
daddy, look. - Where're you goin'?
Charlotte's fairy tale book said, if you make a wish on evening star it shoulda come true.
Hmmh, won't you wish on that star, sweetheart?
Yes, you wish and you dream with all your little heart.
but you remember dear anawet, that old star can only take you part of a way.
you got to help him with some hard work of your own. And then...
yeah you can do anything you said you mind to.
just promise your daddy one thing?
that you'll never, ever lose sign what is really important.
okay?

you need a hand in there, buddy?

I've been avoiding you everywhere.
we are going to be late for the Masquerade.

Oh, dance with me, fat man.

we supposed to be at La Bouff's estate by now.
Yes, yes, yes. But first ...
I buy everyone here a drink.
with what?
at this point you have two choices:
woo and marry richa lady or...
get a job.
all right, fine. But first... we dance.
this is idiocy. - For someone who can't see his feet, you're very light on them!
it's perfect. You're finally getting into the music!
do you get my joke?
because your head is, it is in the tuba!

Lottie, you can't just wish on a star expecting ...
ladies and gentlemen!
his Royal Highness,
prince Naveen.
good Evening, Tiana. Marvelous party.
evening, Mr. Fenner. And. . Mr. Fenner.
I'm smelling meanies. - Gonna be the House specialty, once I signed those papers you're brought.
yes ... About that...
you were outbid. - What?
the fella came in offering a full amount of cash.
less you can tap his offer by Wendesday.
you can kiss that place goodbye.
you know how long it took me to save that money?
Exactly! Which is why a little woman of your background...
woulda had a hands full, trying to run a big business like that.
you better off, will y'all, yeah!
no, wait a minute! - No more meanies, no!
no... hold on a minute! You.you come back!
Tia, time to get prince charmed with those man-catchin' beign...
what happend? - I... I ...just.
Oh, you poor dear. Oh, Prince Naveen, We will be right back, sugar.
I got just a dress for you.
Oh, Tia, honey, did you see the way he danced with me?
a marriage proposal, can be far behind.
thank you, Evening star!
you know, I was taught to think that wishing on stars was just for...
babies an' crazy people.
look at you!
aren't you just as pretty as a magnolia in May?
seems like only yesterday we were ...
both little girls, dreaming our fairy tales dreams.
and tonight they're finally coming true!
Well...back into the fray!
wish me luck.
Oh, Naveen...
# Almost... #
# Almost there #
# People would come here from everywhere #
# I was almost... #
# there #
I can not believe I'm doing this.
please... Please... Please!
very funny.
so, what now?
I reckon you want a kiss?
kissing would be nice, yes?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I did not mean to scare you, I... Wait, no , no...
wait, wait, wait, hold on.
you know, you have a very strong arm, princess.
OK, please! Put the monkey down.
stay back, or I'll... I'll... - Please, please, please...
Ah, oh well... allow me to introduce myself:
I'm Prince Naveen.
of Maldonia.
a prince? But I didn't wish for any...
hold on, if you're the prince, then...
then who was that waltzing with Lottie on the dance floor?
all I know, is one minute I am a prince, charming and handsome, cutting a rug, and the next thing I know,
I am tripping over these.
wait, wait, wait... Wait!
I know this story!
di Frogie Prutto!
the Frog Prince? - Yes, yes, yes...
my mother had the servants read this to me every night.
Yes, yes...
this is exactly the answer!
you...
you must kiss me! - Excuse me?
you will enjoy it, I guarantee. All women enjoy the kiss...
of Prince Naveen.
come, we pucker.
that's new.
look, I'm sorry. I'd really like to help you, but I just...
do not kiss frogs.
wait a second! But... on the balcony, you asked me...
I didn't expect you to answer! - Oh, but you must kiss me.
look, besides being unbelievably handsome,
I also happened to come from a fabulously wealthy family.
surely, I can offer you some type of reward or a wish I could grant perhaps...
yes?
just...
one kiss? - Just one.
unless you beg for more.
OK Tiana, you can do this... Just a little kiss, just a little kiss.
OK!
you don't look there much different.
but how did you get way up there? And how did I get way down here, in all this!
easy princess, do not panic. - What did you do to me?
I... I'm green and I'm... and I'm slimy! - No, no, no...
this is not slime. - What?
you're secreting mucus.
Stella!
get that frogs!
run! - I can't run, I'm a frog.
then hop!
calm boy, calm you monster dog!
look out! Get out of the way.
where are we going? - Excuse me!
I can't see a thing. - Me neither, can I?
wait, Stella... - Get up!
Stella, it's me, Tiana! - Tiana?
Stella just talked to me! The dog just spoke to me!
you know, if you are going to let every little thing bother you...
it's going to be a very long night!
Oh dear?
you are so quiet? - You let him go!
the poor dear frog was scarfing, so I loosened the lid, and...
how do I ever get tangled up in all this voodoo madness?
I can't get through with this.
you wear this... this ghostly flinger! - Amulet!
anything happens to this...
I'm gonna need...
fun fact about voodoo, Larry.
can counter a thing for myself.
besides... you and I both know the real power in this world ain't magic.
it's money.
lots of it.
it's true. - Aren't you tired of living on a smidgens, while all those fat cats in their fancy cars don't give you so much of a sideway's glance?
yes... I am.
all you got to do is marry Big Daddy's little princess...
and we will be splittin' that juicy La Bouff fortune right down in the middle.
Sixty-forty like I said.
but...
what about Naveen? - You little slip-up...
we will be a minor bump in the road, so long as we got the prince's blood in this.
Hahhaha... yes.
voodoo?
you mean to tell me this all happened because you were messing with the Shadow Man?
he was very charismatic!
it serves me right for wishing on stars.
the only way to get what you want in this world is through hard work.
hard work?
why... why would a princess need to work hard?
huh? Oh, I'm not a princess. I'm a waitress.
a waitress? Well no wonder the kiss did not work!
you lied to me!
I... I never said I was a princess.
you never said you were a w... a waitress!
you were wearing a crown.
it was a costume party, - you spoiled little rich boy. - Oh, oh yes, oh ye?
well, the egg is on your face, alright, because I do not have any riches!
what? - I am completely broke.
you said...
you were fabulously wealthy! - No, no, no.
my parents are fabulously wealthy.
but they cut me off for being a... Leech! Leech!
you're broke, and you had the gall to call me a liar?
it was not a lie! I fully inte... Aaah!
I fully intend to be rich again!
once I marry Miss Charlotte La Bouff' and she will help me!
you a prince? - obviously!
she'll help you!
all right then.
once you two are married, you are gonna keep your promise and get me my restaurant, right?
whoa, oh, not so fast.
I made that promise to a beautiful princess, not a cranky wai... why are those logs moving?
those aren't logs!
I got glimpse on a big one.
C'mon, come here! - Come here you tasty one mussel!
where did they go?
lower the vine.
find your own tree.
there he is. - I've seen him! I've seen him!
okay, help me get out of this swamp and once I married Charlotte, I shall get you your restaurant.
you gonna taste so good. You waisted invaluable rat!
quick, quick, pull me up!
you can hop...
but you can't hide. - We got all night!
well, waitress, looks like we going to be here for a while.
so we may as well get...
comfortable.
take your slimes away from me.
I've told you... it is not slime!
it is mucus.
rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty.
gators are gone.
we got to get back to New Orleans...
and undo this mess you got us into.
I was not the one who parading around with your phony baloney tiara.
music de paddle bile.
could use a little help!
I will play a little louder.
how about a little less piggin' and a...
I know that tune! Dippermouth Blues.
play it, brother!
where you've been all my life?!
where did you learn to play like that?
well, the Bajou's is the best jazz school in the world.
all the greats play the riverboats.
Oh, Louis give anything to be up there jamming with the big boys.
so why don't you? - Oh, I tried once.
it didn't end well.
it is been a real pleasure meetin' you, Louis.
and thank you for coming and for not eatin' us.
we best be on our way.
where are you goin'?
to find somebody to break the spell. - What spell?
brace yourself, my skilly friend, we are not frogs...
we are humans.
what?
you are serious?
I am Naveen, Prince of Maldonia.
and she is Tiana, the waitress.
do not kiss her.
now just a second.
this corny here got himself turned into a frog by a voodoo man and now...
voodoo? Like the kind Mama Odie do.
mama, hoodie? - Mama Odie.
she is the voodoo queen of the Bajou.
she got magic and spells of kind a voodoo.
could you take us to her?
to the deepest, darkest part of a Bajou??
facing raser sharks, prick ambushers, and trappers, and hunters with guns?
no.
watch and learn.
Louis, that's too bad we can not help you with your dream.
if only you were smaller... less toothy.
you can play jazz to adoring crowd without scaring them.
anyway, enjoy your loneliness, my friend!
Abenaza.
cute, but it's not gonna...
hey guys, I just had me a crazy idea.
what about if I ask Mama Odie to turn me human?
Louis, you are a genius.
Hallelujah!
# If I were a human being #
# I'd head straight for New Orleans #
# and I'd blow this horn so hot and strong #
# like no one they'd ever seen #
# Louis Armstrong, Mister Sydney Bechet #
# All the boys gonna step aside #
# when they hear this old alligator play #
# Listen! #
# When I'm human #
# as I hope to be #
# I'm gonna blow this horn till the cows come home #
# and everyone's gonna bow down to me! #
# Thank you! Thank you! #
# Aw, thank you! I love you too baby! #
# When I'm myself again I want just the life I had #
# Aye #
# That doesn't sound too bad #
# A redhead on my left arm #
# A brunette on my right #
# A blonde or two to hold a candle #
# That seem just about right Eh, Louis? #
# Life is short when you're done, you're done #
# We're on this Earth to have some fun #
# and that's the way things are #
# Say it, brother! #
# When I'm human, #
# and I'm gonna be #
# I'm gonna tear it up like I did before #
# That's a royal guarantee #
# You are getting married! #
# All right. I just have to leave a string of broken hearts behind me. #
# Your modesty becomes you #
# and your sense of responsibility #
# I worked hard for everything I got #
# and that's the way it's supposed to be #
# When I'm a human being #
# at least I'll act like one #
# If you do your best each and every day #
# good things are sure to come your way #
# What you give is what you get! #
# My daddy said that and now I'll never forget #
# and I amend it to you #
# When we're human #
# and we're gonna be #
# I'm gonna blow my horn! #
# I'm gonna live the high life! #
# I'm gonna do my best to take my place in the sun #
# When we're human! #
Oh, Prince Naveen, dear.
I am positively mortified you had to endure that frog fiasco last night.
well, when you're next in line for the throne, you're poised like a panther, ready to expect the unexpected.
y... your ear? - What?
Oh, there's pesky mosquitoes... everywhere.
get in here!
please, Miss Charlotte, I can no longer ignore the throbbing of my... heart.
even though our time together's been brief, it's been heavenly.
let it... place, Prince Naveen,
you got me blushing like I...
would you do me the honor of becoming Princess of Maldonia?
are you serious?
as the plague.
Yes!
Oh, I most definitely will marry you!
Oh, there's so much to plan!
the guest list! The dress! The music! The flowers! The shoes!
we're gonna have ourselves a Mardi Gras weddin'.
No!
what do we do now?
because somebody let our frog prince go, Larry,
I'm reduced to ask for help from my friends on the other side.
now, this restaurant of yours, is it gonna have etouffee? - Jambalaya, gumbo... It's gonna have it all!
I always wanted to try red beans and rice, - muffulettas, po' boys... - Stop, Louis.
you two are making me so very hungry.
interesting.
what are you doing?
you are frightening the food.
this is harder than it looks.
what? Oh, no! No, no, no!
there is no way I'm kissing a frog and eating a bug on the same day.
hello. - What are you doin'?
stop moving!
you are making me very difficult. - Y'all found anything to eat yet, ah?
Oh, my...
hang on. Old Louis gotta this covered.
no, no, no, no...
how's that?
this could be a little better.
you know what this needs? A sharp stick! Be right back!
this is all your fault! - My fault. My fault.
let me tell you something. I would have a wonderful life...
well, look at you!
girl, I guess you and your boyfriend got a little carried away, am I right, am I right?
no, no, no, this is not my boyfriend. - I am the prince of Maldonia!
let me shine a little light on the situation.
excuse me. One more time now.
that looks better yeah.
Oh, it's ok, baby. I don't explode me. I ain't a firecracker
I just got my big butt glowing in the night.

Oh, you've done this a real goof for sure.

I found the stick!
Louis,
ray here says you've been taking us in the wrong direction.
I was... listen, I was confused by the topography and...

and I need your generous assistance getting him back.
Hahaha, I hear you. Now, what's in it for you?
well...
as soon as I dispose of "Big Daddy" La Bouff, then I'm gonna run this town.
I'll have the entire city of New Orleans in the palm of my hand.
and you'll have all the wayward souls your dark little hearts desire.
you all love that, don't you?
so, we got ourselves a deal?
Hahaha! Now we're cooking! We're gonna find ourselves a frog.
search everywhere. The Bayou, the quarter... bring him to me alive.
I need his heart pumping.

that's your girl? - Oh, no, no, no...
my girl... that's Evangeline. - Evangeline?
she is the most prettiest firefly ever did glow.
you know, I talk to Evangeline almost every night.
she is kind of shy, not say much.
but I know in my heart someday we gonna be together.
Oh, that's so sweet. - Yes, so sweet...
just do not settle down so quickly, my friend.
there are plenty of fireflies in this swamp.
what?
prick ambushers got me...
get down, get down!
darkness... it's closin' in. I'm so cold.
will you hold still, big baby?
I touched it yet.
Oh, take a look at that two jumpers.
I can taste the frog legs already...
with a sauce picante, right Pa?
will you keep quiet!
Oh, my thought is exactly the same.
it's time to catch up some frogs.
you know, waitress, I finally figured out what is wrong with you.
have you, now? - You do not know how to have fun.
there. Somebody had to say it.
thank you, 'cause I figured out what your problem is too.
I am... too wonderful?
no, you're a no-count, polandering, lazy bump on a log.
Ahaha... Killjoy.
What'd you say? - Ah, nothing.
stick in the mud. - Listen here, Mister.
this stick in the mud has had to work two jobs her whole life while you've been sucking on a silver spoon chasing chamber maids around your... your ivory tower!
actually, it's polished marble.
uh, I got me one, boys!
get the little one over there.
the hunt was good today, yes indeed?
hunters with guns!
look at his big frog legs. I will make a good ready with your dinner...
Oh, no, no, no. A bug gotta do what a bug gotta do!
I think I got chipped my favorite tooth.

these two ain't like no frogs I've ever seen.
they're smart. - And we talk, too.

Oh, I'm fine. But your breath done killed me to death!
would you mind?
I got you cover, brah.
Ah, much obliged, PeeWee. Now how about...
the other side.
and we talk too. I like that! You are secretly funny.
not a stick in the mud? - W... well I was...
say it. - Co...
say it. - All right... You're not exactly...
I can't hear you, I'm sorry. What? - a complete stick deep in the mud.
easy! Easy!
I get this one in there, in it, now hold on.
Sug', I know we got to get to Mama Odie a little speed but...
this particular extra occasion gonna take a while, yeah.
Oh, poor Louis. - You know what would make me feel better?
crawfish smutted in Remoulade Sauce.
slow down! - Got a little more!
some banana foster sprinkled with brollies.
how about swamp gumbo? - That'll do.
sounds delicious! I'll start with pre-dinner cocktail and something to nibble on, while I wait, thanks.
no, no, no, no. Your Royal Highness. - What's the matter?
you are gonna to mince this mushrooms. - To do what?
mince the mushrooms.
hop to it!
this is ridiculous. - Are you mincing?
all right... Relax.
one!
step aside, Mister.
watch... and learn.
all right.
there you go. - You know, I never done anything like this before.
Really?
all right.
but, when you are livin' in a castle, everything is done for you.
all the time they dress you, they feed you, drive you...
brush your teeth!
Aw, poor baby.
I admitted it was a charmed life, until the day my parents cut me off, and suddenly I realized...
I don't know how to do anything.
well hey...
you've got to make some descent mushrooms mincer, ok?
Oh, you think so? - Keep practicing and I just might hire you.
Really? - No.
come on...
what was that?!
you said hello and he said what. And you said:
get an ugly face in...
anyone for seconds? - That was magnificient...
you truly have a gift.
well! Thank you!
there she is. The sweetest firefly of all creation.
Envangeline?
I want to meet this girl, where she is?
how can you miss her, she glows right up there, in front of you.
# Look how she lights up the sky #
# Ma belle Evangeline #
Oh, that ain't no firefly, that's a...
# So far above me yet #
# Know her heart belongs to only me #
- I adore you.
Evangeline. - I'm just translating!
# You're my queen of the night #
# So still, so bright #
# To someone as beautiful as she #
# Who loves someone like me #

miss Froggy. - Ma'am?
might I have a word? - Yes, Ma'am.
you's a hard one, that's what I heard.

I need to dig a little deeper and work even harder to get my restaurant.
all right y'all, one more time.
# It don't matter what you look like. It don't... #
nobody goin' to sing with Ray? Okay.
well, if you swell on bein' human, there's only one way.
Gumbo, gumbo in the pot.
we need a precious.
what we got?!
Lottie? But she is not a princess! - Oh, shut and look at gumbo!
that's right... Big Daddy is king of Mardi Gras parade.
so, that makes Lottie...
a princess. - Does that count?
Yes, it does, but only 'til midnight, when Mardi Gras is over.
Hop-Lone, you only got 'til the end to got that princess to kiss you.
once she does...
you both turnin' human. - Midnight?
that doesn't give us much time at all. - What about me, Mama?
I want to be human too, so I can play jazz with the big boys.
I want fingers, and toes, and a belly button, not the kind that sticks out, but the kind that goes in?
big Jaws, you dig little deeper, you'll find everythin' you need.
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon...
you got a river to run here, darling.
y'all best get to swimmin'. - Wait...
I've got a better idea.
they got guns!
bam, that is one Killer Diller costume.
hey dale, can you blow that horn?
come on, stay in with us. - We play on Mardi Gras.
we can miss this. Little Louis gonna finally play with the big boys.
Naveen, you comin'?
I'll catch up with you later.
Oh, Evangeline... why I can't just look Tiana in the eyes and say:
I will do whatever it takes to make all your dreams come true, because...
because I love you.
whoa, whoa, whoa, cap'. You are makin' googoo eyes on my girl?
got you! I will make some shoes out of you.
ray, I'm not in love with Evangeline. I am in love with Tiana.

you will be so happy together. - I will find another way to get Tiana a restaurant.

no, it's cute.
Tiana... I... - There it is!

Oh, can you just picture it? All lit up like the Fourth of July.
Yes, jazz pouring out from every window.

he was trying to propose, that's what all that fun was about.
and here I thought, all he wanted was to marry a rich girl.
Sug', what are we looking for in here?
you just keep your eyes at one of the biggest goddess float with a Mardi Gras princess about to kissed herself a... a frog.
dear beloved, we are gathered here tonight in this fine celebration to join together this prince and this young woman in holy matrimony.
Oh, no, this can't be right, darlin'. Then how you can still be a frog?
mama Odie... She's...
I know what we've seen with our eyes but...
if we just go back there we gonna find that your fairy tale come true.
just because you wish for somethin', doesn't make it true.
it's like my Evangeline always said to me... - Evangeline is nothing but a star, Ray!
a big ball of hot air a million miles from here.
open your eyes now!
before you get hurt.
she's just big in a broken heart... That's all it is.
come on Evangeline. We gonna show sug' the truth.
if any of you, object to the union of this two people speak now or forever hold your plea.

Oh, I do.
then so, by the power invested in me by the state of Louisiana
I now pronounce you...
man and...
prince Naveen!
goodness gracious! Are you all right? - I just need a moment to compose myself.
cheese and crackers!
Lawrence, why are you doing this?
it's payback for all those years of...
humiliation. - Get your royal a...

I got him.
he got me too!
gimme that! - Stay on the side!
ray?
Hey, why did you stop?
Oh, it's a real gator!
Sug'? Sug'? - Ray?
this proves what we saw ain't what we thought we saw.
what is this? - It's voodoo,
the Shadow Man, he's been usin' voodoo...
you can't let Shadow Man get this, no matter what. Now run girl, run!
do not make me light my butt.
I got lightin' on me. Come here, you!
OK, come!
ray!
what...
ray?
back off! Or I'm gonna break this into a million pieces.
Naveen?
now, isn't this whole life better than hoppin' around bayou for the rest of your life?
shadow Man?
got a headache to you, Tiana.
when you dream, you dream big.
just look at this place! Gonna be the crown jewel of the cursancy.
and all you got to do, to make this reality is handle that little talisman of mine.
no. This... this is not right.
come on, darlin'? Think of everything you sacrificed.
girl, all you ever do is work. - I told y'all she wouldn't come.
think of all those maecenas who doubted you.
you ain't never gonna get enough for the dang payment. - Woman of your background, you better off will y'all.
and don't forget your poor Daddy.
now, that was one hard working man. - See you tomorrow, James!
double, sometimes triple shifts.
never let know how bone tired, beat darlin' really was.
daddy! - Hey, baby cakes.
shame on that hard work, didn't amount much more than a busted up, old gumbo pot.
and a dream that never get off the back porch.
but you...
you can give your poor Daddy everything he ever wanted.
come on, Tiana.
you're almost there.
my Daddy never did get what he wanted.
but he had what he needed.
he had love.
never lost a sight what was really important. - Easy with that! Careful!
and neither will I.
y'all should've taken my deal. Now you will spend the rest of your life bein' a slimy little frog!
I got news for you, Shadow Man!
it's not slime, it's mucus!
No! No!
how am I ever gonna pay back my debt?!
friends!
# Are you ready? #
No! I'm not ready at all! In fact, I got lots more plans!
# Are you ready? #
this is just a minor setback in a major operation!
as soon as I whip up another spell, we'll be back in business!
I still got that froggy prince locked away!
I just need a little more time.
No! No, please, no!
just a little more time!
I promise I'll pay y'all back! I promise!

your shini', retirin' bride, completely is gettin' anxiety.
Hello, darling!
miss La Bouff
please down here.
let me to introduce myself. I am the real Prince Naveen
of Maldonia.
did you say prince?
boys, drag this maggot down to the Parish prison. - I'm completely innocent.
the Shadow Man bamboozled me.
goodness gracious! This is so much to absorb.
let me see if I got this right.
if I kiss you before midnight, you and Tiana will turn human again, and then we gonna get ourselves married and live happily ever after!
the end! - Yeah, more or less.
but remember, you must give Tiana all the money she requires for her restaurant.
because Tiana...
she is my Evangeline.
anything you want, sugar.
pucker up, buttercup!
wait! - Tiana?
Tiana? - Don't do this.
I have to do this and we are running out of time!
I won't let you! - It's the only way to get you your dream!
my dream?
my dream wouldn't be complete without you in it.
I love you, Naveen.
warts and all? - Warts and all.
all my life, I read about true love and fairytales, and...
Tia, you found it!
I'll kiss him! For you, honey!
no marriage required.
Oh my word!
m... maybe that ol'clock's a little fast!
I'm so sorry!
Tiana! Naveen!
Louis, what is it?
shadow Man lay poor Ray low! - Ray?
he's hurtin' awful bad.
Hey, sug'!
how come, y'all still... - We are stayin' frogs, Ray.
and we are stayin' together.
Oh, baby. I like that very much.
Evangeline like that too.
so, by the power invested in me...
I now pronounce you frog and wife.
get to it, Hop Lone, and give your lovely bride some sugar.
Congratulations!
this gonna be good!
like I told y'all, kissing a princess break the spell.
once you became my wife, that made you...
a princess.
you just kissed yourself a princess!
and I'm about to do it again!
# In the South Land #
# there's a city #
# Way down on the river #
# Where the women are very pretty #
# and all the men deliver #
# They got music It's always playin' #
# Start in the day time, go all through the night #
# When you hear that music playin' #
# Hear what I'm saying and make it feel alright #
who would've thought the prince woulda had a younger brother.
how old did you say you were? - I'm six and a half.
well, I waited this long.
# Grab somebody, come on down #
# Bring your paintbrush, we're painting the town #
# There's some sweetness going around #
# Dreams do come true in New Orleans. #
Eva, we've got to go now!
now, now!
come on, Eva!
come on, hurry!
come on, run! Eva, come on!
come on, Eva. We don't have time.
we don't have time.
come on, Eva! - Get out the door!
run! - Eva!
go, go, go, go!
mommy!
get back! Go on, go!
hold on to me.
let there be light.
Yeah.
not exactly the Garden of Eden.
after a blast, everything gets vaporized and sucked up into the atmosphere.
and it rains back down to earth...
as radioactive dust.
number one rule:
no one opens that door till the radiation clears.
you understand me?
you want to survive, you listen to me.
Jesus!
someone get the lights!
you okay? You okay?
someone get the lights! - Calm down. Calm down.
don't touch that.
holy shit, it's the dust! It's the dust!
that dust is from the inside.
the bitch is sealed tight.
what was that? Another bomb?
that was our building coming down.
how the fuck do you know that?
I don't want to be down here.
I want to go now.
I know, sweetie.
but Uncle Mickey says we have to stay.
Why? - Because your face will melt off and your hair will fall out.
she's a little girl.
I was just fucking around.
so that was a nuke? - Definitely.
fucking rag-heads.
we got to stay down here? - Bet your ass we do.
that door stays sealed until the radiation clears.
and how long's that gonna take?
when I say.
what's the plan, Mickey?
well, my plan was to build a fallout shelter and take it easy while my pain-in-the-ass tenants barbecued above me.
does anybody's cell phones work?
no, there's no signal.
I fucking lost mine. - You lost it?
is that a radio?
give it a try.
cocksucking jack-off.
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello, do you copy?
what's down here?
as you see, just a bunch of storage cells full of junk.
Hey, uh...
uh, it's Mickey, right?
Yeah.
why do you have so many mattresses?
because I'm the super of a goddamn apartment building.
so why do you have so many mattresses?
what the fuck do you care?
I sell them on the Internet.
turkish bath in here.
sorry, ladies, no running water to wash your panties.
toilet's on the left.
it's septic, so after you finish, throw some lime on top of it.
that's fucking disgusting.
it's called saving water.
sure, whatever. I've got to take a dump.
what's in here?
that's my room. Nobody goes in there but me.
mama, I'm hungry.
uh, Mickey...
do you have anything to eat?
the food is adequate, I hope.
don't thank me all at once.
no, the food's good. Thanks, Mickey.
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
anybody there?
Hello?
shut up back there.
Hello?
we have survivors in a building on the northwest corner of 29th and 5th.
I repeat, the northwest corner of 29th and 5th.
do you copy?
do you really have to smoke that thing?
I mean, there's already so much dust in here.
so when can we go up?
when I say so.
fuck it. Ade, come on, let's go.
Adrien, come on. Bobby, let's go. We're out of here.
let's go. Fuck it.
what do you think you're doing?
get away from the door. I won't tell you again.
I told you! - Josh!
look out! - Get away from the fucking door!
get away from the goddamn door! - Come on!
go ahead. Shit!
what the fuck, Mickey?
God damn it.
fucking...
fucking big man with that ax, huh? Keep pushing me, Mickey.
keep fucking pushing me, you're gonna see what happens.
ever see what happened to those poor Japanese bastards...after we dropped Little Boy on Nagasaki?
the skin melting off their bones.
faces like roadkill.
lucky ones died in the blast.
and those kids in Chernobyl...
eyes and... ears.
shit growing all over 'em.
tumors the size of grapefruits popping out of their necks.
enough, Mickey. We get it.
what you need to get is if that dust gets in here, we're all fucked.
hope not.
come here, honey. Let me braid your hair.
can I borrow that, please?
of course.
Thanks. - Yeah.
you kept it.
of course I did.
Eva,
I'm sorry if I've been acting a little bit nuts.
I'm just trying, you know, to keep it together.
I guess that's what survival is, just trying to keep it together.
but I love you.
and you love me.
and that's what's going to pull us through this nightmare.
it'll make us better parents.
Eva.
Eva. - What?
come on, honey. Just one more bite.
I want to go home.
do you want me to try and warm them up for you?
we are going to die, aren't we?
no, honey, we're not going to die.
we're going to live.
let's just do our meditation, okay?
shut your eyes.
really picture the beautiful light and how good it makes us feel.
let's do that right now, okay? Come on.
shut your eyes. - It doesn't work.
it does work. - I want to go home.
Wendy, you just have to be patient, okay?
and then it'll get better outside.
and then somebody'll come down and they'll help us.
promise? - Promise.
thank you.
gonna have to eat this shit every day?
What'd you say?
what?
I give you food, shelter, and that's what you say?
fuckers come down here, expect me to take care of you.
what do you contribute? What'd you bring to the fucking party?
take it easy, Mickey.
all my family and friends are probably dead, and all you can talk about are fucking beans?
come on, Mick!
are we really supposed to rely on this guy?
Sam. - No, no, no, no, really, really.
how long can you keep us alive in this... in this...
shit hole. - Yes, exactly.
you know what? This is a fucking shit hole, man.
calm down. Sam...
no. No, I'm sorry. I won't stop.
stop. - I won't stop because I want someone to do something, that's all.
I need someone to do something. - Sam, calm down.
no, I won't calm down because I... - Sam.
Sam, please stop. Stop!
do something, man. Come on! - Sam, please stop.
instead of just sitting around waiting to fucking die.
don't be scared, Wendy.
uncle Mickey only slaps little girls.
and you're a big girl, aren't you? Want to see a magic trick?
I'm gonna take my thumb off for you, all right?
Yeeow! God, that hurts.
seen that one before?
okay, let me think of another one.
making your cigar disappear?
Oh, shit.
shit.
it's a rescue.
down here! Down here!
cut the lights. - What the hell for?
just do it.
you guys, what's going on up there?
Hey, okay, we're civilians, all right?
okay, we're all on the same side, right?
whoa, what are you doing?
didn't you hear him?
mommy!
help me! No!
No! - Help me!
Wendy!
no, no!
No! No!
No!
get back.
go, go, go! Run!
God!
we've got another 2-8-Baker.
give me the lock! Give me the lock!
what lock? - Get me the chain!
I don't need your help. - Get out of the way.
come on, come on. Put the chain on there.
Mickey! - Hey, Mickey!
I need some help. Adrien got shot.
put him down over here. - What? Okay.
whoa, whoa.
Hey, somebody fucking get something. He got shot!
Oh, shit.
I got to look.
Oh, shit, Bobby.
what the fuck? - Somebody get a medical kit.
thank you.
I got it. I got it. - I don't know what to do.
I got it. I got it. - There's nothing here that's usable.
it's all from, like, 1984 or something.
you gotta take the bullet out, right? - It's gonna sting, okay?
all right.
Oh, fuck! - Sorry.
you're gonna be okay, man. - He's gonna die.
he's fine. - He's gonna fucking die.
shut up! He's not gonna fucking die.
what do you want me to do?
it's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right, all right?
arch your back. Just lean a bit. - Come on.
almost got it. - Almost? He's gonna be all right?
so he's gonna be okay? - He's gonna be okay.
you're lucky it didn't hit the artery.
he's gonna be okay. - Okay, you got to clean that out.
I got it. Thank you.
come over here. Come over here.
okay?
put your hand on the back there.
press hard on the front, keep your hands on the back.
that's fine. That's good. - Yeah.
just like that. He'll be all right.
Where's Sam?
hold this. - Yeah, I'm here.
hold this as hard as you can. - I'm here. I'm here. I got it.
Sam. Sam.
you okay? You hurt?
you're alive.
you're alive. - Are you okay?
I'm okay.
looks like some sort of biohazard suit.
it's a radiation suit.
bet we got hit by one of those loose nukes I've been reading about.
it's just a matter of time before one of them hajis got their hands on one of them.
so you're saying it's the Arabs?
of course they're Arabs.
they've been at war with us for 20 years.
it's just that we've been too busy stuffing ourselves at the trough to notice.
we should have wiped them off the map when we had the chance.
now it's probably too fucking late.
Oh, shit.
okay, that's disgusting.
let me guess, North Koreans.
you're a fucking idiot. - Get out of here.
Oh, fuck!
holy shit.
grab the tape.
I got her. All right. Okay.
I got her. Ow!
all right, all right. Take it easy.
grab her arms.
put her in the storage room. Come on.
get the door. Get the door.
No!
top rations. Mickey's orders.
I'm fine. You take it. You take it.
can you make anything out?
only thing I caught was something about finishing up the sweep.
and they're American accents.
turn off the fucking radio, man.
that's what got us in trouble in the first place.
Hey, Mickey, what is that in your pocket?
whether it's making a damn fine sausage or exterminating an entire race of people, those Germans don't fuck around.
you're holding out food on us now?
I got a couple of bits and pieces in my room.
it's my place. It's my right.
just go back to your room. - Damn it!
has anyone fed Marilyn?
what the fuck is your problem, man? Don't waste that.
what's so funny?
what?
what's so funny?
Oh, nothing.
just what you said and how you said it.
"has anyone fed Marilyn yet?" Like she's your fucking dog.
he gets it.
show some respect. She just lost her kid.
go back to sleep, Adrien.
where are you going?
where are you going?
she's pissed.
you've got something on your face.
other side.
that's it.
she's all that's good in me.
I'm sorry.
too risky. - What do you mean it's too risky?
whatever's in the air outside, it's in here.
your goddamn duct tape won't make any difference.
at least we can find out what's going on out there even if we don't find her kid.
you're volunteering? - I'm volunteering.
he's volunteering. I say if he wants to go, let him go.
let me go. Come on. - I don't trust you coming back.
what is your problem with me?
he's got a problem with everybody. - What about Josh?
no. Fuck, no. - Me?
what about Josh? - You want me to go?
he ain't got the brains and that faggot ain't got the balls.
he'll come back for his brother. - Thanks, Mickey.
I'll go.
no, no, no, Eva. Eva, you can't be serious.
I'll go. - Don't be stupid.
I'll go. - You happy, Mick?
you a punk. You know that? You a punk.
when you ain't got no ax in your hand, then you got something to say.
I don't think he's gonna like what he finds out there.
at least we have to try.
glove.
how's your tube? - Tube is good.
excuse me.
do you have air? Is it working?
you got one more to go. - Is the compressor gonna work?
Yeah, it's fine. - There it is.
good to go? - Yeah.
let's go.
promise me you'll bring her back.
I'll do my best.
let's go, guys. - Let's do it. Let's go.
let's do it.
what the hell is that?
Hey, Josh.
don't worry, man. I... I got this.
Wendy.
hold it.
go.
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey. - What did you see?
you're okay. - I think I got two of 'em.
what did you see? - Where's your gun?
they got this... this lab set up there. It's like... it's like...
Josh, what else? - Like what?
what else? - What do you mean what else?
that's it. There's no survivors.
there's no other civilians. There's no fucking Red Cross.
I don't know if they're army. I don't even know if they're American.
I'm sorry.
they're coming back.
no.
they're welding us in.
how are you holding up? - Uh, I'll live.
Delvin gave me his pain meds.
mind if I take a look?
I just want to clean it.
you know it's gonna sting a little.
sorry.
you a nurse or something?
no.
you're just gonna have a nasty scar.
Yeah, well, chicks dig scars, right?
you lived below us, right?
Yep.
was that you who played guitar?
Yeah. Did that annoy you?
no.
no, I actually really liked it.
helped me sleep sometimes.
it keeps most people awake.
not me.
is everything all right?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Ugh, how can you eat with that smell?
we've got to get rid of those bodies.
how, exactly?
chop 'em up, toss 'em down the septic.
should have tried harder to get that door open.
that door is welded shut.
we should have put the bodies out when Josh went out.
shame we let those bodies go rotten.
what do you mean?
you ever heard about that rugby team that survived the Andes?
their plane crashed.
they were forced to eat their friends and family.
they survived up there for months.
they ate everything...
ears, toes, assholes.
Uh-huh, arms, legs, brains, the spleen.
the only thing they didn't eat was the penis.
if worse comes to worst, you all have full permission to eat my body.
Yeah, you do. But not my penis.
nobody... nobody but nobody eats Bobby's penis.
what's that for, Mickey?
Uh-uh.
Delvin?
well, yeah.
fuck, yeah.
Yeah, I'll do it.
come on.
I can do this, man. I got this.
but can he live with it?
Hey, Bobby? - I got this, man.
Yeah, I'll be... fine.
it's just like cutting lumber.
I'll start with the arms.
I'll just get my swing down.
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.
chop a body from head to toe.
it's blunt.
man, what you doing in here?
what?
how did you get in here, man? I heard you.
when did you come in here? - Fuck off.
how did you get in here? What you got in your pocket?
punk.
I was dreaming about Mom.
you think she's okay?
I don't care.
she's your mom. She's not mine.
just 'cause she cut my sandwiches...
Hey, Adrien. - Yeah?
I only went out there to see if there's a way out for us.
Hey, was Mickey an aviator or something?
look at these.
what the hell's going on in here?
come on, Mickey, we're just looking for some escapism, all right?
I told you from day one that this was my room and you were to stay out.
your casa is our casa now.
I don't know what you're talking about, but you're gonna regret this.
this is my ball.
you got it out of my apartment?
I got it out of your ass. - You got it out of my apartment.
Hey, he's got forks.
Adrien. - I've been looking for this ball.
don't need to use your dirty fingers any... hey!
this is a very valuable ball. - You got it fixed.
hit down here, come this way, and jab real hard and start firing like this.
now if they're behind you and they have a gun behind you...
this is amazing. - What you want to do is feel that tip.
once you feel it, come to the outside.
the gun will discharge this way.
take your arm, take both their hands, pull with this hand, and go forward and you'll take the gun away.
all right, soldier, fight safe and come back to the United States.
Oh, another one? - Mm-hmm.
where the hell did you get that one? - It's the last one.
come in.
Hi.
here's the makeup.
Thanks.
makeup.
Hey, listen, Marilyn.
you know, if you need to talk about anything, anything like that, I'm here.
you know? 'Cause...
I'm sure she's better off than we are right now.
what are you talking about?
Wendy.
Eva.
you are a very beautiful girl.
and I know you know what men are like.
Oh, yeah. - What do you think's gonna happen the longer that we stay down here, huh?
what do you think is already happening?
I don't know. - I do.
listen, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here, all right?
don't you think you should just be a little nicer to the rest of the boys?
especially Josh.
fucking hands off me.
all you knew we had was this much?
that's all there is! What do you want me to do?
that's not all there is. - That's just fucking wonderful, Mickey.
that's impossible. There is no way we can survive with that.
no way. No way.
you got us into this situation, now fix it.
I got us into this situation? Are you out of your fucking mind?
I was rationing them.
we're gonna fucking starve to death, Mickey.
we're gonna die of thirst, Mickey. Where's the food?
what do you want me to do?
I'm not your nanny, you arrogant prick!
I'll bet you're just waiting for one of us to die so you can have all the food that you can fucking eat, huh?
Oh, shit. What are you...
what is your problem, Mickey? What is your problem?
my problem is you!
you're fucking dead. - And you, and you!
you're fucking dead, Mickey. - You're my fucking problem!
get back. Get out of here. - You get out of here!
take a walk. - You get out of here.
it's my fucking... - Take a fucking walk!
guys, please. Delvin, come on.
you see he's the only one not dropping any pounds?
always stuffing his pig face.
I'm telling you, that motherfucker is up to something.
stop playing around with that. Okay? I'm trying to talk to you.
what do you want to do, Josh?
I want to get that fucking door open, - even if we rip it off its hinges. - Fucking-A right, man.
do you agree with everything my brother says?
you mean your half-brother, right?
what, you don't agree?
have you looked at us? Huh?
look at me. We're dying in here.
where would you rather be?
door's welded shut.
we got one working suit.
there's not a lot of options.
there's always options.
I knew you had some stuff in here somewhere.
you crazy fuck.
it's a peace offering for...
thank you. Uh-huh.
back up.
back up and open it.
all right.
move over so I can see it.
start again.
don't give me an excuse to use this. Open it.
got it. Now push it open.
Where's it lead to? - The fucking White House.
where are the lights? - There ain't no fucking lights.
don't you fuck with me.
Oh, man.
help!
it's Delvin and Mickey.
holy shit! What the fuck, Mickey?
this motherfucker, he comes in here and he sticks a Taser in my face, and he said he was gonna kill me unless I gave him the rest of the food and water.
then he... he goes for the gun. I caught him off guard.
then we started fighting over the gun and it went off.
it went off? - Yeah, it just went off.
and that's it.
it was self-defense.
it was...
it was self-defense. - Stop!
get off me! - Bobby, get him!
it was self-defense, motherfucker!
Adrien, help me!
Sam, get his legs! Get his legs!
get his legs! - Get off, motherfucker!
Eva, get the gun! - Get off!
hold on to him! - Get off me!
it's a combination lock. It won't work.
it's a combination lock.
somebody wake him up.
you know what I think?
I think we should kill the maniac right now.
Jesus, Bobby. - Hey, Mickey.
all right, let's fucking do it.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.
let's get civilized about this, please.
come on. Josh?
you saw what he did to Delvin. Huh? The guy's a whack-job.
he has been fucking with us since the first...
you know what? Give me the gun.
give me the gun. Eva.
you don't even know what happened.
give me the gun. - Let's get to the bottom of this first.
what are you doing? You bitch! - Josh.
what if those guys come back, huh? - Josh, come on.
get the fuck out of my way. Fuck.
we need the fucking combination, Mickey.
the combination.
Aah! - What is the combination?
Sam.
what's behind that door? Put his head forward.
Aah! - What's behind that door?
what's behind that door? - You're gonna die.
you're all gonna die. - Huh?
I'll never give you the combination.
go get the knife.
no? - I don't care what you do to me!
you can kill me! I don't care if I die!
you don't care if you die? - No! I kind of want it.
Aah! - Huh? You want to die?
as long as I'm strapped in this chair, I'm stronger than you.
you're never gonna get that combination from me.
Never! - No?
and I will starve to death. Will you?
Bobby! - Give me the fucking combination,
Mickey, or I'll slice you from ear to ear.
you hear me? - Stop!
you're so fucking dead. - No! Get off of me, you faggot!
get off of me, you faggot! I'll starve to death.
put the knife down, you guys, please.
you shouldn't have thrown the gun down the toilet, Eva.
fuckers! Fuckers! - Come on, Josh, think about it.
what's the combination? - Fuck you!
put down the knife. - Yeah, do it.
Josh, no! - What's the combination?
put down the knife. - Do it! Do it!
Josh, no!
stop! - What's the...
let her go, Josh. Let her go. Let her go.
I don't know why you wanna fight, boy.
okay, okay, Josh. Josh, look at me.
look at me. - Stop it, Josh!
I'll cut that pretty neck of yours. - Fuck you!
keep the fuck back! - Look at me, Josh. Look at me.
I think it would be a better idea before we torture someone, you let your anger pass.
if I have to calm down and rationalize this,
I don't know if I'll be able to take a knife and cut his fucking fingers off.
do it! - No.
last chance, Mickey.
how about that?
how about that's your last chance, you fuckin'...
go ahead. Do it. - Fucking yuppie.
do it. Do it. - Do it. Do it.
go ahead. Go ahead. - Do it. Go ahead.
go ahead and do it! Do it, faggot, do it!
how's that feel, huh? How's that feel?
how does that fucking feel? - Aah!
Oh, God.
it's okay. It's okay.
look at that. Look at that. There it is, huh?
see how easy that thing came off?
Hey, Josh, let's do another one. - Another one?
Yeah. Let's do a thumb. - You want a thumb?
nine! - Nine, motherfucker?
No! - What's the combination?
Mickey, give him the combination, please!
okay. Okay.
nine. - Nine. Come on.
11, then zero, then one.
9-11-0-1. Now he's a fucking canary.
that wasn't so hard, was it, Mickey?
go get the door open.
9-11-0-1 . go.
just fucking go!
you faggots!
faggot, you'll never amount to anything.
what are you looking at? What are you looking at?
you're a fucking coward!
coward! - Nice souvenir, huh?
Yeah. - You fucking cowards!
Hey, Mickey, I got you in my pocket now.
Oh, that's funny.
you're real funny, you stupid shit.
a fucking brain the size of a fucking pea, you fucking idiot.
you red-headed stepchild. And you, you fuck!
you're a fucking coward, man.
fuck you!
Mickey.
Mickey.
won't you play with me?
Ooh, they got beans.
see, I told you he was holding out on us.
we should still kill him.
shut up, Bobby.
what did you find?
nothing.
Hey, Mickey, you want to see a magic trick?
now you're not alone.
you fucking missed.
you missed.
you want it, Sam?
Oh, my God.
Oh, God damn it.
that's disgusting.
Marilyn.
don't waste that, Marilyn.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. - Clean yourself up.
let me massage you.
no, it just... it hurts.
all right? Just... - I can make you feel better.
no, just... just stay off me, all right?
Marilyn, I don't think he wants to be touched.
you stink, okay? Just stay off me.
I said get off of me!
stay. Stay.
Marilyn, why don't you put some clothes on?
that filthy nightie is disgusting. I can't even eat.
well, thanks, Sam.
now why don't you go over there and suck on his dick?
you should suck his dick because we all know that he's not getting any at home.
what, Sam, her pussy like the fucking Sahara or something?
all right, Josh, let it go.
Marilyn, let me ask you a question.
why is it that old women can't age gracefully?
your tits are at your waist.
someone pulled the ripcord on your inflatable ass.
and your skin is like fucking sand...
Josh, leave her alone. - Stay out of it!
I'm not a child. - No, she's not.
but I like that.
stop it.
Oh, what?
Yeah. Oh, you, too, Sam?
Yeah, go fetch her, boy.
Eva.
Eva.
I can't stand it in here. - Shh.
it's okay. It's okay.
Sam.
Sam. - Come on, Eva.
Sam, please stop. Please stop. - Please, please, please.
Sam, just go away. - Please, please.
Sam, stop it. - Eva, please.
Sam, get off of me!
Josh, do I look like a space alien? Huh?
holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Hey.
yeah?
how about a drink?
sure.
Thanks. - Yeah.
Cheers.
thank you.
I should go.
Yeah.
Liz?
I'm so sorry about everything.
come on, you motherfuckers!
come and get me! I got nine more fingers for you!
Hey, Marilyn.
it's gonna be okay. - Where are you, baby?
it's gonna be okay. - Bring back that sweet ass.
you stay with us. Don't worry. - Marilyn.
you stay with us. - Oh, there she is.
she got off the leash again. - It's okay.
Marilyn. Marilyn. - Come back to bed.
she's gonna stay in here with us, all right?
Josh, let her stay in here.
Marilyn. - No!
come on, let her go. Let her go.
let her go! - Eva, she's yours.
Marilyn! Marilyn!
let her go! - Eva, wait, wait.
let her go! - Wait, let it go.
Aah! Fuck!
it's okay. - I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
it's okay. I'm fine.
sorry to interrupt.
you guys have to Mickey-sit.
and Josh would like to see you alone.
this looked like your size.
what do you want, Josh?
decided you should ration your own food and water.
is this for the three of us?
no, two. Mickey's fasting.
okay.
of course, Eva, if you want more, I'm open to barter.
no?
maybe I'll just take this back.
what's going on?
I'm rationing the supplies.
Yeah, well, Josh, they're the group's supplies.
it's not your call.
well, groups break down into self-interest during times of scarcity.
and someone needs to make the tough decisions during times of war.
it's in the DVDs.
so what's next, huh?
you cut off Bobby?
then me?
bro...
there is only us.
let's do it again.
Oh, God, more. More.
I have to ration it. - Ration your end.
this is our end. This is what Josh gave us.
get me out of this chair.
you held out on us, Mickey.
I was gonna tell you about the food.
but first I had to make sure that when this supply ran low, who I could trust and who would go bad.
Eva, come here.
come here. Eva. - What?
come here.
there's something in the storage room they don't know about.
what? - It's a gun.
Sam.
you have to do something.
what the fuck are you talking about?
he told me there's another gun.
he's a compulsive liar and a fucking murderer.
if you won't help me, I'll do it alone, Sam.
what are you gonna do when you find that fictional gun?
are you gonna kill them?
we can't provoke them.
I can talk some sense into them. Yeah.
I was a fucking lawyer, remember?
I was a fucking...
Sam, wake up.
you were nothing, just a fucking drug addict living on the streets.
so don't you dare to tell me to wake up.
you got to be a cowboy. Cowboys touch penises.
do it. Do it. - No, no.
I'm not gonna touch it. - Touch it.
no way. - He doesn't want to touch it.
he doesn't want to do it. - Do that other thing.
the big one? - The big one.
what did I just say?
the little one. - But you said...
little dog.
the little one.
the little one is a...
the little one choking. The little one choking.
give him a treat.
all right, here we go.
Eva Beaver. - Wow.
come on in. - No, I just need to talk to Sam.
well, we're in the middle of a game here.
Sam, I need to talk to you.
I haven't finished yet. - He hasn't finished.
Oh, don't worry about Marilyn. She's zoned out.
you know what? You should play.
Yeah, come on. Come on in.
I insist.
there we go. There we go.
get her a drink, Sancho.
thank you, maître d'.
so, Eva...
truth or dare?
I'm not gonna play.
you're gonna play 'cause you're sitting at my fucking table.
how about we play for food and water?
so come on.
truth or dare?
truth.
do you love Sam?
good question. - Come on.
there's no getting out of this one, Eva.
do you love Sammy?
Yes.
Ooh, congratulations, Sam.
and my brother?
you already asked your question.
that is true, Josh. Those are the rules.
that's true. - Fuck, she got me, man.
Mm-hmm. - Okay, um...
it's your turn to ask. So come on.
ask a question. It's your turn.
come on, just say, "Josh, truth or dare"?
ask a question.
okay, dare. No, truth.
last time I said dare, Bobby wanted me to eat Mickey's finger.
you're a sick fuck.
fucking disgusting. So come on, ask a question.
ask a fucking question.
ask a fucking question!
did you enjoy torturing Mickey?
no.
I did what had to be done.
but what have you done for us?
huh?
come on, Josh. - Okay, fuck it, Sam.
what's up? You want a turn? Truth or dare?
dare. Go cut up Delvin's body.
come on, Sammy. Circle of truth.
you accepted the dare, Sammy. Time to follow through.
I'm not cutting anyone. - Do it.
don't be such a chickenshit. Huh?
do it.
stop. - Do it.
you got a penis, Sam? - I'm not cutting anyone.
do it. - Bobby, stop it.
stop it, Bobby. - Do it.
Eva, how can you be engaged to such a pussy?
stop it, Bobby. - Do it! Do it!
do it! - Stop it!
Atta boy.
Sam, sit down. Sam, sit down.
Sam, don't!
Sam, don't.
help me.
Sam, don't. You don't have to prove yourself.
you don't have to do this.
all right, Sam, now remember, it's just like chopping lumber, but not.
all right, knock yourself out.
go for it.
hold it high. - No.
don't.
come on.
you fucking pussy. - Why don't you do it, Bobby?
you love chopping up people. Why don't you do it?
well, you see, I've already cut up a body.
give me a kiss. Right here. - Whoo!
I think we know who the man of the house is.
get the fuck... get off me. - Robert.
get off me. - Get the ax.
no, no, no, no, I can do it!
you're gonna cut him up.
Josh, don't! What are you doing?
do it or I break his arms.
come on.
do it! Do it! - Do it.
do it! Do it! - Do it!
do it! Do it! Do it!
who's next?
Bobby.
so how's a little bit off the top?
you ready?
okay.
look at us, huh? Look at us.
Yeah. - We're the same.
the same.
you're my brother now.
Where's the gun?
get me out of this chair.
it's in a red coffee can in the panic room.
I never said I'd untie you.
you'll do the right thing.
Eva, there's another way out.
what? - Through the septics.
but you're gonna be swimming through a whole lot of god-awful shit.
you know it's in the hair?
it's in the hair.
what's the going rate on a bottle of water, Sancho?
got to be some infidelity for sure.
Yeah. - No.
stop. Stop.
she sounds like a racehorse, Robert.
I'll bet she goes off like one, too.
please. - Don't spoil it.
please, not like this. - Not like what?
Robert. - What?
get lost. - I thought we could share this one.
Oh, God.
it's in the hair.
she just broke.
Hey.
what happened? - Marilyn's dead.
they killed her.
you okay?
what are you doing?
you have to get the gun. In the panic room.
where? - In the red coffee can.
Hey, assholes. - Oh, God.
you're supposed to keep the batteries charged.
we're trying to watch a movie.
Yes, Bobby, but it just died.
all of a sudden. - What the fuck, Sam?
it just died? What the fuck?
store's closed.
not here. Not here.
not here, please.
please.
come with me.
this is your fault.
you didn't fucking charge the battery.
sorry. Yeah, yeah, well... - Oh, shit.
why do you look so nervous, Sam? Huh? Go do something.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Bobby. You're right.
you're right. I'm sorry.
where are you going? - I need to go to the toilet.
I'm sorry, Bobby. You're right.
wait. Wait.
why don't you just slow down?
Oh, bitte. Oh, bitte.
Oh, bitte. Oh, bitte.
Oh, bitte.
what are you doing, Sam?
well, you said you were going to the bathroom.
the bathroom's down the hall and to the left.
I'm just starving, Bobby.
I need something to eat.
okay.
help yourself. - Thank you.
you know, I'm standing here and you're standing there, and we're both thinking the same thing, aren't we?
what?
please, get me out of this chair.
get me out of this chair. Get me out of this chair.
please, get me out of this chair.
are you my friend, Sam?
Yes, I'm your friend. What... what are you doing, Bobby?
will you be my Sancho, Sam?
your what? - My Sancho.
Sancho Panza? - Sure.
what? Sure. Yes, I'll be your Sancho...
say please, pussy.
pussy?
please. - Please.
pussy. - Pussy.
please, pussy. - Please.
pretty please, pussy. - Pretty please.
pussy. Not just pussy. - Pussy.
pussy. Pussy. - Pussy. Pussy.

I don't know what you just said, but that sounded sexy as fuck.
now suck my dick. - What?
suck my dick. Suck my dick. - What? No.
suck my dick! - No, no, no!
come on, Bobby. Come on, Bobby.
Bobby, come on. - Suck it.
Bobby. Bobby, come on. - Suck my dick.
suck my dick. - Bobby!
Bobby, stop! Ah!
stop it!
stop!
I'm just fucking with you, Sam.
Yeah, we changed the combination two weeks ago.
open sesame.
I don't think we have croissants.
I know how you Frenchies love that shit.
but I'll find you something.
wait, wait.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
I don't want to just fuck you. Wait, wait, please.
you were right about Sam.
Sam's not a real man like you. You're right.
I need a real man.
what are you doing?
I want to touch you.
I just want to touch you.
what, I said, are you doing?
what are you doing?
I just wanted to touch your skin.
you want some apricots? - Apricots are for faggots.
I like apricots.
you know, Sam, you really blew it big time.
you know, I knew Josh would tap that ass.
you really blew it.
what the fuck are you doing, Sam?
Shh.
shut up.
Shh.
Josh! - Shut up!
all right. - Stand up.
stand up.
now march.
come on, Sam.
No!
I'll fucking kill you!
get off! Get off her!
get off of her! Run, run!
I've got the gun.
I've got the gun. - Sam.
I've got a gun! I've got a gun.

Sam, keep the gun on Bobby.
you'll never do it, pussy.
come on, shoot me. - Sam!
shoot me. Come on, shoot me.
shoot me! - Keep the gun on Bobby.

Hey, get up. It's time to check the buoy.
come on, Josh.
Oh, no.
so you regret proposing to my sister?
what I regret is letting you plan my engagement party.
I know.
here, get this into you.
it's my great-gran's hangover remedy.
Oh...!
smells like shit.
Oh, God.
you're spilling it.
you know, once you get past the gag reflex, - it's actually not that bad. - Yeah.
Rory...?
I'll check the buoy.
Oh, my sister's down the beach. She wants to show you something.
looks like it's gonna be a busy one. Want a hand with that?
what, you're actually gonna get wet today?
make a bit of a change, wouldn't it?
Hey.
I bet you've never seen one of these.
what is it?
Wow.
were you looking at my butt?
no.
no? - Maybe.
Aww.
you look terrible.
Thanks. It's your brother's fault.
but you smell nice.
you always smell nice.
are you ready to leave all this behind?
where you go, I go.
well, there won't be places like this in Singapore.
Oh, we'll come back.
shit.
shark! Shark!
get help!
go get help!
Rory!
get everyone out of the water!
Joe, give me a hand.
Rory!
No!
Rory!
shark! - I can't hear you.
shark! - What?
give me your hand.
Rory!
I got you. I got you.
no.
No!
along with the yearly southern migration of the humpback whales along the East Coast waters, "Surfline" surfing spokesman Jeff Tripp said people should be very vigilant this time of year, as we've seen large gatherings of sharks in the waters following the whales along the coast.
now, what they're doing is hunting the whale calves and bait fish surrounding the migration.
so if you are heading to the beaches, please observe the signs and swim only between the flags.
great whites are expected in the area over the next month.
and now, on a brighter note, it's been a picture-perfect day here on the East Coast with blue skies as far as the eye can see.
no signs improving for the sailors and the windsurfers, however.
we seem to be hit with the doldrums, which means there are no surface winds.
we gotta move to the car park.
can't stay here.
Yes, please.
Hey. - Hey.
Jessup come by yet? - Not yet. You're safe.
good morning, by the way.
Yeah.
shake your body
shake your body
shake your booty..
why are we stopping here?
Hey, Kyle. - Shh.
you're bad.
Hey.
shut up.
what are you doing here?
you scared me.
happy anniversary.
you remembered.
11 months, baby.
it's not very much. It's just a song playlist for when we go to Sydney.
thank you. Thank you.
Ooh, and...
happy anniversary to you too.
tell me you didn't steal these. - Oh, Ryan.
Yeah, okay, okay, put them back.
but then I have nothing to give you.
doesn't matter. It's the thought that counts.
put them back, okay?
come on.
Oops, I hope we're not interrupting anything.
you know, that's a really cool jacket.
Thanks.
bet it's got lots of pockets, huh? Mind if we take a little peek?
she's gonna pay for it.
just take it out of my paycheck if you don't believe me.
paycheck?
you're living in a dream world, kid.
you're fired.
and you... shoplifting, destruction of property.
I've already called the cops.
did you see all those birds this morning?
there must have been thousands.
you know, there were crows and magpies and everything.
when did you get back?
Tina, this is what you want?
Josh, this is...
Oh, Jesus. Josh, look at you.
go clean yourself up.
no, not the customer bathroom.
I got the call.
Oh, shit.
Whoa! Hello.
you starting to hear something stirring around that head of yours?
the office is at the back of the store.
cash pickup's in 10 minutes, so you've got five to get out.
when this is done, we're straight.
my brother's clean and I don't want to ever see your face around him again.
you understand me?
whatever you say.
I want her charged this time.
she didn't steal this.
this is hers.
we both know you're not gonna go through with it.
just stop, because I'm this close.
to what? Arresting me?
Yeah, real A-plus parenting, Dad.
Jaimie, you're too smart to... - Oh, you just dropped to a C-minus due to lack of originality.
okay, okay, what about this?
I'm gonna process you this time.
you can spend the day in lockup.
and what do you think that's gonna do?
maybe it's the wake-up call you need.
piss off.
what do you think your mother would have thought about all of this?
piss off!
put that on. That's it.
Thanks. - Great.
what the...?
give me the money.
shit, man, there's no money in the safe.
give me the money.
all right, just... Just take it easy, okay?
you see?
where is it?
do you want a separate bag for that?
Hey, drop that fucking gun...
or I'll do this bitch!
Where's the money?
you... I said, put the guns down!
put 'em down!
thank you.
my dad was totally...
your dad's right, Jaimes.
not you too.
I lost my job today because of you.
who cares? You hated that job anyway.
I care. I care.
well, if it's that important to you,
I'll go get your stupid job back, then.
Jaimie, just... - No. Watch.
Oi! Freak boy from history class, right?
you, get here.
get here. - No.
you, get over there. Stay back.
no. - Stay back.
do as you're told.
what the fuck did you do?
Josh.
get back.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
don't be a hero, mate. Stay back.
Tina.
No!
stop it.
what was that?
What...?
down! Down!
come on.
Oh.
I should know, I built the store.
hurry up. This way.
come on, come on!
go! Run!
Hey!
over here!
have you seen anyone?
anyone else? Anyone?
I need help.
anybody?
help!
Hey. - Here.
Where's Tina?
Where's Tina?
Jesus Christ.
can you help him? I don't know what to do.
just calm down. - Can you help him?
calm down.
what the hell's happening? What just happened?
we gotta get him out of the water.
help me lift him onto this shelf.
I need you to go and find anything you can to wrap this leg...
towels, electrical tape... I don't care.
okay.
dad? Dad!
my God. Jaimie!
dad?
Jaimie. - Dad!
here, give me your hand.
Jaimie.
da...
dad.
how did you get out?
I was in the car.
I was in the car park, and...
Ryan... Ryan...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Ryan's still in the car park.
forget it, kid. - Ryan's still in the car park.
forget it.
if it's flooded up here, they've had it down there.
Tina?
Tina!
okay, I need your help.
I need you to help your dad, okay?
put your hands here and keep pressure on his leg.
can you do that for me?
you'll be fine.
Tina.
Tina. Hey.
you're okay.
look at me.
you're okay.
what... what happened?
where are all the people?
Hey, come on.
here, give me your hand.
help me. Help me. - Okay, okay.
help me. - Calm down. Calm down.
help! We're trapped!
someone get us out of here! - Is anyone there?
anyone? Anyone? - Help!
somebody help us, please.
did you hear that?
did you hear that? - Shh. Stop talking.
where did it go? Do you hear it?
not when you don't shut up.
well, excuse me for helping, Kyle, really.
it's behind you. It's behind you.
Yeah, you find that noise. You find it.
good boy, Bully. Good boy.
shit.
fuck. Fuck.
fuck.
can anybody hear me?
Hello?
is anybody there?
Oh, fuck.
Oh.
fuck, fuck, fuck.
are you ready?
we've got to get out of here.
we can't stay here. We've got to get help.
What...?
Oh, shit.
don't let him out of your sight.
the water's still rising.
no, no, it can't be.
the whole bloody town must be flooded up there.
no, it's not. Look, they're gonna come for us.
they know we're down here. They're gonna come for us.
that's assuming there's someone still up there to come.
you, this is all your fault. - Not mine, boy, not today.
today Mother Nature saw us all as sinners down here.
why don't you just shut up?
he can't swim anywhere with this leg.
I'll stay here.
you guys find a way out and bring a rescue team back.
what? No, Josh, wait.
well, how do we get out?
with the car park flooded, that leaves only the loading bay storeroom and the front entrance.
Josh, you cannot stay here, okay? You know as well as I do, this is gonna bring aftershocks with it. It's gonna bring more...
more waves, I know.
so you'll have to be quick.
okay, well, Steven and I will check the front.
I'll take the loading bay.
I don't think so.
Bob? - Yep.
you go.
okay.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
how could you not have charged your phone?
I can't do everything, Kyle. God, why didn't you charge it?
uh, because it's not my phone.
Oh, well, then where is your phone? Hello.
Oh, well, that's much better.
what is it, Bully?
why are you growling like that?
because he's a fucking retard.
that is not funny, Kyle. You're not a retard, Bully.
what the hell was that?
I have no idea.
what's that?
where did it go?
get everyone out of the water.
what?
get everyone out of the water now!
what's happening?
Tina! Out of the water now!
can't get out that way. - Hurry!
it's blocked.
out of the water!
quick, swim.
what's going on?
Tina, Steven, get out of the water!
Collins?
Tina, hurry!
where is he? Where did he go?
Oh! - Shit.
Jaimie, get back.
help me! Please help me!
help me!
shit.
where did it go? Did you see it?
what the hell could do that? What is in here?
there.
give me your hand.
ow, my hand.
Jesus Christ.
that had to be five feet. - What had to be five feet?
six. - Six? What do you mean, six?
six feet from the tip of the dorsal to the tip of the tail.
so what the hell does that mean?
it means there's a 12-foot great white shark in here.
fuck!
I can't see anything. - Just keep calm, babe.
we have to get out of this car. I can't stay here much longer.
give me your shoes.
excuse me?
well, I need something with a point to break the windscreen.
give me your shoes.
are you crazy? These are $300 Gucci.
they're gonna get wet anyway. Just give me your shoes.
no. - Heather, give...
I'm not giving you my Gucci.
they're not Gucci.
um, clue... you gave them to me for Christmas last year, and you said that they were $300 Guccis.
um, clue... I know I did, and they're not.
you bought me fake Gucci.
you wouldn't have known if I didn't just tell you.
I can't believe you. Fake Gucci?
just give me your shoes.
what are you doing?
thank you. - Mm-hmm.
Hey! Hey, over here.
freak boy? Is that you?
Jesus Christ, I never thought I'd actually be happy to see you.
Yeah, no shit. Did you find anyone? Is there anyone else?
there's bodies everywhere. There's no one alive.
well, did you check the ramp?
it's all jammed up. I can't get through.
you got a phone or something in there?
uh, no.
holy shit, Kyle. Kyle!
what? What?
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
it's okay.
I think it's gone.
Oh, shit.
Oh, man, this is not happening.
this is so not happening.
you... you're a cop, right?
you gotta do something.
for Christ sakes, do something.
do you have any ideas?
Oh, you think this is funny, do you?
more ironic, really. - Oh, really? Well, please share.
I'm sure we could all do with a good ironic laugh right now.
think about it.
you bust your ass in here eight hours a day, seven days a week.
right?
you'll probably hump away like that for the next 40 years.
so whatever way you cut it, this place was gonna kill you.
now it's just sooner rather than later.
you son of a bitch.
I want you to know, the woman you killed... her name was Julie, and she was a friend.
I didn't kill anyone. - It makes no difference.
she died during your robbery, so it's your fault, you bastard.
if we get out of here alive, I swear I'm gonna make you fucking pay.
enough!
it's coming back.
why does it keep doing that... just circling?
because it's not sure what we are.
it's curious.
curious about what?
a shark's only curious about one thing.
it's trying to decide if we're food or not.
what was that? - Hang on, everybody.
just hang on.
we have another problem.
why are you laughing?
cause he just realized when the water hits those cables, this whole place will light up like a Christmas tree.
jessup, where do we shut it down?
the storage room.
all the power mains are in the storage room.
I'll go.
what? - Everyone go to the end of the shelf, make as much noise as you can.
I'll swim for it.
Josh, no.
I mean, you can't. Your arm... look at your arm.
I mean, the shark will go straight for you.
you can't, not with that.
I don't think we have any other options.
hold on.
I have an idea.
do you see it anywhere?
Yeah, I see it, but I'm keeping it a secret from you because I want you to be surprised.
Oh, well, thank you for your thoughtfulness, Kyle, really.
it's what I always dreamed of in a boyfriend.
Oh, I can't handle this much longer.
it may surprise you, but I am not equipped to deal with this kind of situation.
here, Bully, I need some space.
Kyle, do something. You have to do something.
like what? Ask the fucking thing to go away?
Oh, shit.
help! - Help us, please! Help us!
get down. Get down. Get down.
help us! Do something!
okay. - Help us!
all right, just get back in the car.
just stay as still and quiet as possible.
what, are you fucking insane? - Just listen, listen.
why don't you jump in the water and do a couple of laps?
all right, just listen to me. You gotta keep still, okay?
the more you scream, the more the shark's gonna come.
Hey, hey, just get back in and wait.
I'm gonna get the shark to come to me.
wait, wait, wait, wait. What?
when I get it over here, you swim like hell for my van over there. You see it?
this is crazy.
babe, look at me.
don't move.
stay here as still as you can. Can you do that?
you think this will work?
Absolutely.
I wouldn't eat a cheeseburger with its wrapping on.
but of course...
I'm not a shark.
here.
Yeah.
look...
you don't know me...
but when Tina came to Singapore... - I don't want to know about it.
well, you should.
we were never...
the whole time she was there...
she missed you.
it wasn't your fault...
what happened.
that's what she said.
Hey, I found some water.
good?
you come back, okay?
just come back.
ready?
here you go.
Oh, shit.
Oh, man, he's not gonna make it.
he did it.
he did it. - Where is he, Josh?
No!
no.
fuck it. No!
hey... are you okay?
look, we've got to try to keep it together.
okay?
I know. I just...
when's it gonna end?
and why is this happening?
Why?
when my mom was dying...
she died two years ago...
she was so sick.
I tried.
a couple of months before she died, I left.
I couldn't take it.
I just took off to America.
and...
I wasn't there when...
so this is my payback.
life saying, "Screw you."
how are you gonna run away from this?
here.
there's a secret to it.
you have to do it gently.
just peel the two pieces of plastic apart.
like that.
Thanks.
was she a friend of yours... the girl that got killed?
Julie?
no, not really.
I mean, I knew her and everything, but...
it was just supposed to be me, you know?
a quick in and out. Nobody else, just me.
I guess it's true what they say...
let the devil take your hand and God will make you pay.
we're not gonna make it out of here, are we?
I don't believe that.
no.
we'll make it out of here.
good.
Oh, shit, it's working. It's working.
go now. Go, go now, now.
come on, go, go, go.
fuck! Swim!
swim! - Climb! Just climb!
sorry, Bully.
fuck!
stay back!
bully! Bully!
fuck!
you need to slide it through...
not fling it.
it's strong, but it can't take much weight.
screw this. I'm out of here.
if you can get through, you get help and bring them back.
Yeah, yeah, all right, all right.
ready? - Let's go.
got it?
pull him up! - I can make it. I can make it.
pull up now. - I can make it. I'm okay.
give me your hand.
are you gonna talk to me or what?
no.
Heather, I didn't... - Don't.
don't even try.
murderer.
I'm not a murderer.
Oh, yes, you are.
you're a dog murderer, which is worse than a person murderer.
how could you?
Heather, I didn't have a choice.
bullshit. You always have a choice.
murderer.
whatever.
Argh!
uh!
Hey. Hey.
can that pipe hold my weight?
I can't get out this way. I want to get to that door.
what do you think?
I don't know. Give it a go.
you all right? - Yeah.
can you see it anywhere?
I don't know. You're the one with the bloody torch.
shit.
are you okay?
Whew.
Ooh, Jesus.
are you all right? - Yeah.
good stuff. Keep going.
is he gonna make it?
babe, shut up.
shit.
you're good. You got, like, six feet. Keep going.
Oh, shit. Hold on.
grab on. Grab on.
shit.
swim, swim, swim. Quick, quick.
quick. - Got you, buddy.
Kyle! No!
quick, quick. - Give me your hand.
give me your hand!
we're not gonna just sit around and wait for that thing to pick us off one by one.
and what do you think you're gonna do?
at the very least, I'm gonna die on my own terms and not when that damn fish decides it's time.
so you think what?
you're gonna catch it?
why not?
what are you gonna do if you catch it?
spark up the barbie and crack open the tartare sauce?
I'm gonna tie it to this shelf and we're gonna swim like hell to the entrance.
get the hell out of here.
all I need is a hook.
you can't save everybody, mate.
you must be getting used to that by now.
it's not that far.
if we can distract the shark,
I'll swim it, get the hooks.
I'll do it.
what? Dad, no.
Oh, you can't, not with your leg.
my leg is exactly why I should go.
dad, no, please.
you keep my daughter safe.
no matter what happens, you get her out of here, okay?
Jaimie!
Jaimie! Jaimie!
Naomi, make noise, get the shark to come toward us.
hurry, quick, make some noise!
Jaimes, are you okay?
Yeah.
okay, hang on.
jump!
good work, kid.
so what's the deal?
do you know her or just want to?
I used to.
used to, huh?
whatever was there, still is.
that was a long time ago.
trust me, after this shit here, everything we knew is a long time ago.
you still wear that.
Yeah.
Tina... - You don't have to.
we don't have to do this, Josh. - No, I do.
I wasn't fair to you.
I just...
I always set the buoy.
Rory did it for me that day.
but I should have been the one out there.
Josh.
and I hated myself.
but...
before I knew what had happened, everything just...
slipped away.
and I'm sorry.
I just wanted to say that.
I'm sorry.
the thing is, Josh...
you never had to say sorry to me.
all you had to do was say it to yourself.
I would have been there.
Hey, you all secure down there?
Yeah.
why didn't it take it?
well, if you ask me, I think it's pretty obvious.
after the past couple of hours, it's decided it prefers live bait.
that's not funny.
do I look like I'm joking?
get down!
you stay back. Stay back!
I saved this last bullet for you, Doyle.
you son of a bitch. - You.
what about the mask on the body?
wasn't me, mate.
now, how about we get ourselves a shark?
it really is a pretty good idea.
we just need better bait.
and this looks pretty tasty, eh, Doyle?
Kirby, listen to me.
you don't want to do this.
don't I?
no.
what you did earlier doesn't matter right now.
so you let her go and we can work something out.
shut up, cop.
don't bullshit me.
I shot someone. That's not going away.
now, I'm getting out of here and I'm catching this fucking shark.
and whatever happens... happens.
get in there!
Josh, no. - Anyone thinks about touching her, you go in too.
Naomi, here.
you're okay. Okay.
so you want to help?
you think it needs live bait?
well...
let's give it what it wants.
Oh, my God.
it's worked.
now let's get out of here.
I don't think anyone's coming for us.
I think if they were, they'd be here by now.
I don't know.
maybe they're trying and they're just dealing with the same shit we are.
bully?
bully!
Oh, float over.
no, don't. No.
come on, Bully. - Baby, swim.
grab him quick.
Yay. Bully.
it's a sign. I know it is.
Yay.
you're a good boy.
get up.
it's okay, sweetheart. Come on.
what are you doing? - I don't know. Call it a sign.
what is that?
it's Ryan.
Oh, my God, it's Ryan.
I have to go get him.
Jaimie, no. Jaimes.
go after her, please.
Josh.
I'll be back soon.
he's down there. I know he is.
wait here.
is he there? Did you see anyone?
all right, give me a hand.
we have to close this door, so that when we open the one downstairs, we don't flood the car park.
Jaimie! - Ryan!
there's a shark. Get out of the water. - Quick, quick! Go, go!
go, quick!
give me your hand!
come on.
Josh!
come on!
it's Dad's car. There's a gun.
what? - There's a gun in the back.
go to the other side. Get the shark to come to you.
Hurry! Come on!
hurry, quick!
Josh, quick! Josh!
come on, quick. Come on.
no go this side.
make sure everyone's out of the water, okay?
dad. - Jaimes?
Jaimie!
get everyone behind the ramp and out of the water.
you know what you're doing?
I'm gonna hook this up and I'm gonna blow us a way out of here.
hold on!
is everyone okay?
Yeah.
Tina! - Josh!
shit. Get out of the water!
hit it.
Josh.
what are we gonna do now?
start over.
Oh, the shark has
pretty teeth, dear

I'm not drunk. Slow down.

I just can't walk or undress myself.
come on in the water.
take it easy. Take it easy.
help me!
I'm coming. I'm coming.
it hurts!
Oh. My God!
please help!
how come the sun didn't use to shine in here?
we bought the house in the fall. And this is summer.
somebody feed the dogs.
right.
do you see the kids?
they must be in the backyard.
in Amity you say "yard."
they're in the "yard." Not too "far" from the "car.
how's that?
like you're from New York.
mom. I got cut. I got hit by a vampire.
you were playin' on those swings. Weren't you?
those swings are dangerous. Stay off there. I haven't fixed them yet.
I think you're gonna live.
it's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen. - Hello.
Yes.
can I go swimmin'?
yea, but let me clean this thing off first.
what do they usually do? Wash up or float up? Or what?
no... Keep 'em there.
I'll be out in about 15, 20 minutes. All right?
dry you off. Go on. Get a Band-Aid.
got to go. Missing person.
season hasn't started. Nobody's even here yet.
listen, Chief... be careful. Will ya?
in this town?
Bye. Dad.
wait a minute. Let me get on.
I want my cup back!
you'll get it.
wave goodbye. Bye.
nobody saw her go into the water?
somebody could've. I was sort of passed out.
you mean. She ran out on you?
no, Sir.
she must've drowned.
look. I reported it to you. Didn't I?
you live here?
no, Hartford.
I go to Trinity. My folks live in Greenwich.
your folks were born here. Right?
yea, I'm an Islander.
they moved off when my dad retired.
you an Islander?
no, New York City.
you here for the summer?
come on.
hold it.
Oh. Jesus.
where you're up awful early.
is the Chief in there?
well. Chief, what have you got on?
if this new filing system is to work...
...you must keep that old stuff off my desk.
just the pending.
Yes, Chief.
now, we got a bunch of calls about the Karate school.
it seems that the 9-year-olds from the school have been...
...karate-ing the picket fences.
chief Brody's office. The Medical Inspector.
the Fire Chief wants you to go over the Fourth of July...
Polly, I want a list of the water activities that the city fathers are planning for today. All right?
right away!
Hendricks! Where do we keep the "Beach Closed" signs?
we never had any.
no?
there's a truck with New Hampshire plates in front of my store.
just have him fill out the form.
just fill it out.
look what the kids did to my fence. Eight and nine-year-olds...
any glasses?
Yeah. Glasses.
are you looking at this, look that what things they did have. - I'll call you later in the afternoon.
you got my promise.
this stuff ain't gonna help me in August.
the summer ginks come down here in June.
you haven't got one thing on here I ordered.
not a beach umbrella. Not a sun lounger. No beach balls.
if I can't get service...
Polly sent me to tell you that there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in Avril Bay.
doin' the mile swim for their Merit Badges.
I couldn't call them in. There's no phones out there.
okey. Come on. Get out of there.
take this stuff back to the office and work on those signs.
beaches Closed. No Swimming. By order of the Amity P. D.
let Polly do the printing.
what's the matter with my printing?
let Polly do the printing.
Hey, Chiefs.
chief Brody!
listen. We had a shark attack at South Beach this morning. Mayor.
fatal. I have to batten down the beach.
okey, Albert. Come on. You kook. Keep your arms up.
Charlie. Take me out to those kids. Will ya?
Martin, You're gonna shut down the beaches on your own authority?
what other authority do I need?
technically, ou need a civic ordinance or a resolution by the board.
that's going by the book.
we're really a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here.
this is your first summer. You know.
what does that mean?
I'm only trying to say that Amity is a summer town.
we need summer dollars.
if they can't swim here. They'll...
they'll be glad to swim at the beaches of Cape Cod. the Hamptons. Long Island.
that doesn't mean we serve them a smorgasbord.
but we've never had that kind of trouble in these waters.
what else could've done that? A boat propeller?
I think possibly yes. A boating accident.
that's not what you told me over the phone.
I was wrong. We'll have to amend our reports.
and you'll stand by that? - I'll stand by that.
a summer girl goes swimming.
swims out a little far. She tires. Fishing boat comes along...
it's happened before.
I don't think you appreciate the reaction people have to these things.
Harry, I appreciate it. I'm just reacting to what I was told.
it's all psychological.
you yell "Barracuda!" And everybody says. "What"?
you yell. "Shark!..."
...we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July.
okay. You can take us back now.
I'm gonna get my raft and go back out in the water.
let me see your fingers.
Alex Kintner. They're beginning to prune.
just let me go out a little longer.
just 10 more minutes.
Thanks.
there are no Islanders. None of them are from the island.
it's just a big bother.
well, you dream of...
all I want to know... I just want to know one simple thing:
when do I get to become an Islander?
Ellen. Never. Never.
you're not born here. You're not an Islander. That's it.
don't bother him. Come right back.
Martin, I know you got a lot of problems downtown...
...but I've got a couple of problems I wish you'd take care of.
one. I've got some cats parking in front of the house.
I can't get to the office.
and that garbage truck next to the office, that's terrible.
what I need is a red zone. It's simple. You can take care of it.
you've done it before. - Honey, would you come here a minute, please.
are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.
look. If the kids goin' in the water is worrying you...
no.
...they can play out here on the beach.
it's all right. Let them go.
it's cold.
we know all about you, Chief.
you don't go in the water at all, do you?
that's some bad hat, Harry.
chief Brody, you are uptight.
come on.
that's it.
Oh, do you know the muffin man
the muffin man who was...
Tippet! Tippet! Tippet!
Tippet! Come on, Tippet!
did you see that?
blood!
get everybody out!
get them out!
get them out!
Michael. Get out of the water!
Alex!
Alex!
Alex Kintner was a kid was missing in the beach. His mother sayed was the shark...
we don't even know if there's a shark around here.
I can't argue with you. I can't talk to you.
I've got to talk to Mrs. Kintner. This is turning into a contest.
OK. It's not just the Gazette. She's advertising in out of town papers. Now people likes me all over the...
I suggest we move to council chambers where we'll have more room.
I'm responsible for public safety here.
then go out tomorrow and see that no one gets hurt.
Martin, come on...
it's a small story. I'll bury it as deep as I can.
the ad is gonna run on the back along with the grocery ads.
right in here, please.
move on in. Please.
why do you insist on playing the heavy?
I have a point of view and it speaks for many of the people here.
not only me. Because I have the motel. How do you feel about it?
I hope they can close the beach.
let's have some order.
let's have some order, please.
any special questions?
is that $3. 000 bounty on the shark in cash or check?
I don't think that's funny. I don't think that's funny at all.
that's private business between you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.
Martin. Would you please... Chief Brody.
I just... I just want to tell you what we're planning so far.
what about the beaches, Chief?
we're gonna put on the summer, the extra summer deputies as soon as possible.
and then we're gonna try and use shark spotters on the beach.
are you going to close the beaches?
Yes, we are.
we're also bringing in some experts from the Oceanographic Institute on the mainland.
only 24 hours.
I didn't agree to that.
only 24 hours.
24 hours is like three weeks.
you all know me.
know how I earn a livin'.
I'll catch this bird for you. It ain't gonna be easy.
bad fish.
not like goin' down to the pond and chasin' blue gills or tommy-cods.
this shark. Swallow you whole.
shakin'
Tenderizin'.
down you go.
and we got to do it quick.
got to bring back the tourists that'll put your businesses on a payin' basis.
but it's not gonna be pleasant.
I value my neck a lot more than $3. 000.
I'll find him for $3. 000.
but I'll catch him and kill him for $10. 000.
you got to make up your minds.
gonna stay alive and ante up...
...gonna play it cheap and be on welfare the whole winter.
I don't want no volunteers. I don't want no mates.
there's too many captains on this island.
$10. 000. for me. By myself.
for that, you get the head, the tail, the whole damn thing.
thank you very much, Mr. Quint.
we'll take it under advisement.
Mr. Mayor,
chief...
...ladies and gentlemen.
Oh. God. You scared me.
you know, Ellen, people don't even know how old sharks are.
I mean, if they live 2, 000, 3, 000 years...
they don't know.
enough.
you're not going to be able to go to sleep tonight.
come on.
Thanks.
want to get drunk and fool around?
Oh, yeah.
Mikey really loves his present.
where is he?
sitting in it.
good God.
all right, Michael, out of the boat.
tied up to the jetties. Sittin' in the boat.
I'm helpin' Michael.
get out of that boat.
Hi. Dad. Just a little longer. Please?
it's his birthday tomorrow.
I don't want him on the ocean!
he's not on the ocean. He is in a boat. He's not gonna go in the water.
I don't think he'll go in the water again. After what happened yesterday.
now don't say that.
I don't want that to happen. You know that.
I want him to read the boating regulations.
the rules before he goes out on his own.
Michael, did you hear your father? Out of the water now!
now!
I'm tired. Let's stop before someone reports us.
don't worry! The chief lives on the other side of the island.
am I comin' in straight?
don't worry about it. Just keep rowin'.
we better catch something. This is my wife's holiday roast.
don't worry about it. $3. 000 buys an awful lot of roast.
come and get it.
the tide's takin' it right out.
can't we go home?
Hey, He's takin' it...
go. Go. Go. Go. Go.
Charlie. Take my word for it. Don't look back.
swim. Charlie. Swim.
come on, Charlie, Swim!
swim, Charlie, Come on! To me, boy!
come on, come on, Charlie! Swim!
come on, Charlie, keep coming. Keep swimming, Charlie.
come on, a little more. Atta boy.
Atta boy, atta boy.
I can't get up, I can't get up.
give me your hand.
I can't get up, I can't get up. Help me!
get your feet out of the water!
can we go home now?
so then Denherder and Charlie sat there tryin' to catch their breath...
...and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
that's not funny. That's not funny at all.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
looks more like The National Enquirer.
all right, all right, Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
just like I said, hold it!
hello.
hello. Back. Young feller. How are you?
say. I hope you're not goin' out with those nuts, are you?
the Weetock boat's gotta move out first.
you have to move out, or he can't get out at all.
don't raise sail. you're going to luff it.
you got a paddle on the boat?
I got a paddle.
scull it out of here. Officer, wait a second, wait a second, just...
Hey. How many guys are you gonna put in that boat?
whatever's safe. Right?
Yeah. Well that ain't safe.
Eazy, atch it. That's dynamite.
take my duty and waiting for me.
where are you goin' with that?
I'm goin' on the boat.
no. No . no...
please. Please. Help me get those guys out of the boat. Will you?
sure. Come on.
gentlemen, gentlemen.
the officer asked me to tell you that you're overloading that boat.
go on. Get out of here.
you ain't going. What do you care?
then, can you tell me if there's a good restaurant or hotel on the island?
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.
they're all gonna die.
Polly, listen to me. We've got some road block signs outside.
you... You've got to get somebody to help us.
Yeah, get those road block signs out on the highway.
because we've got more people down here than we can handle.
yea.
what are you doing? These are your people. Go talk to them.
they aren't mine. They're from all over the place.
you see the plates in the parking lot?
connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey...
I'm all by myself out there.
what happened to the extra help?
that's not until the Fourth of July.
you know those guys in that fan-tail launch out there?
yea, None of them will get out of the harbor alive.
that's what I'm saying. You know their names. Talk to those clowns.
everyone seems to be having a good time.
Polly, I'll get back to you.
listen. Could you tell me how I could find Chief Brody?
who are you?
Matt Hooper. I'm from the Oceanographic Institute.
for Christ sakes. You're the guy we called.
I'm Brody, I'm Brody.
oh...I'm glad to meet you.
I'm glad to meet you, too.
listen, I know you got a lot on your hands right now. But...
what can we do for you?
well, I thing the best thing for me to do is to see the remains of the first victim, the girl on the beach.
OK, fine, Just bear with me. Will ya?
sure.
Wait'll we get them silly bastards down in that rock pile.
there'll be some fun. They'll wish their fathers had never met their mothers...
...when they start diggin' the bottoms out and slammin' into them rocks. Boy.
get away from there. You goddamn fool!
what's the matter with you? You want to swamp us. You crazy son of a bitch?
what are these guys doin' out here?
tell us, what are they doin' back there?
they're chummin' right now.
what is that?
they're tracking the shark now.
$3. 000 divided four ways is what?
let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.
victim identified as Christine Watkins.
female Caucasian.
yea, and here's the way we have it.
probable boating accident.
the height and weight of the victim can only be estimated from the partial remains.
the torso has been severed in mid-thorax.
there are no major organs remaining. May I have a glass of water?
the right arm has been severed, above the elbow...
with massive tissue loss, in the upper musculature.
thank you very much.
partially denuded bone remaining. This was no boat accident.
did you notify the Coast Guard about this?
no. It was only local jurisdiction.
the left arm, head, the shoulders, sternum and portions of the rib cage are intact.
do not smoke in here, thank you very much.
this is what happens.
indicates the non-frenzy feeding of a large squalus.
possibly longimanus or isurus glaucus.
now...
the amount of tissue loss prevents any detailed analysis...
...however. The attacking squalus must be larger than any normal squalus found in these waters.
didn't you get a boat and check these waters?
no.
now, this is not a boat accident.
and it wasn't any propeller. It wasn't any coral reef.
and it wasn't Jack the Ripper.
it was a shark.
I wanna go AP and UPI. I wanna get on the state wire services.
see if Boston'll pick it up and go national.
call Dave Axelrod in New York and tell him he owes me a favor. All right?
now. This is the shot I want with everybody and the fish in it. Ok?
guys, could we please get organized?
I want to get a picture for the paper.
now, can we just have the...
Ben Gardner get this?
no, We caught it.
Congratulations!
it's a beauty. Eh?
please, I need a picture for the paper. Clear out of the way. Please.
just the guys that caught the fish. Open it up a little bit. Please.
I want to get a picture of the guy with the fish.
please, I need a picture for the paper. Could we get the sign please?
come on, we want you... - I didn't catch...
kneel down, just like in high school. One row kneeling, one row standing.
come on, just get out of the way.
young fella, could you step out of the picture?
take your rake with you.
we're ready. - Thank you.
can you get that, please.
how's that?
Larry. You won't believe it.
what kind of a shark is that?
I don't know. I think it's a mako.
it's got a deep throat, Frank.
Yeah, but what kind? What kind of shark?
tiger shark.
a what?
we can start breathing again.
is Ben getting plenty of pictures?
that is a big mouth.
you stuff your friggin' head in there man. And find out if it's a man-eater. All right?
all I'm saying is that it may not be the shark.
it's just a slight...
I want you to meet Matt. This is Larry Vaughn, our Mayor.
Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.
nice to meet you.
terrific, huh, Mayor?
there are all kinds of sharks in the waters. You know?
Hammerheads, White tips, Blues, Makos...
and the chances that these bozos got the exact shark...
there are no other sharks like this here.
it's 100 to 1.
I'm not saying that this is not the shark. It probably is, Martin. It probably is.
it's a man-eater. It's extremely rare for these waters.
but. The fact is, the bite radius on this animal is different than the wounds on the victim.
I just... I want to be sure. You want to be sure.
we all want to be sure. Okay? What I want to do is very simple.
the digestive system of this animal is very very slow. Let's cut it open.
whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours...
...is bound to still be in there. And then we'll be sure.
it may be the only way to confirm it.
look, fellas let's be reasonable.
this is not the time or the place...
...to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.
and I am not going to stand here and see that thing cut open...
...and see that little Kintner boy spill out all over the dock.
chief Brody?
I just found out...
...that a girl got killed here last week.
and you knew it.
you knew there was a shark out there.
you knew it was dangerous.
but you let people go swimming anyway.
you knew all those things...
...but still my boy is dead now.
and there's nothing you can do about it.
my boy is dead.
I wanted you to know that.
I'm sorry, Martin, she's wrong.
no, she's not.
all right. Fellas...
...let's cut this ugly son of a bitch down before it stinks up the island.
Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow and dump it in the drink.
come here.
give us a kiss.
Why?
because I need it.
get out of here.
the door was open. Mind if I come in?
I'm Matt Hooper.
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.
your husband's home? I'd really like to talk to him.
Yes, so would I.
come in, Come in. Can I get you some coffee?
no, nothing, thank you.
Oh, Wine, how nice.
how was your day?
swell.
I got red and white. I didn't know what you'd be serving.
that's nice.
is anyone eating this?
no.
my husband tells me you're in sharks.
excuse me. Yes, I've never heard it quite put that way.
but yes, I am. I love sharks.
you love sharks?
Yeah, I love them, I love them.
when I was 12 years old. My father got me a boat. And I went fishing off of Cape Cod.
I hooked a scup and as I was reeling it in...
...I hooked a four and a half foot baby thresher shark...
...who proceeded to eat my boat.
he ate my oar, hooks, and my seat cushions.
he turned an inboard into an outboard. Scared me to death...
...and I swam back to shore.
when I was on the beach...
...I turned around and I saw my boat being taken apart.
ever since then. I have been studying sharks...
...and that's why I'm gonna go to the Institute tomorrow...
...and tell them that you still have a shark problem here.
why do you have to tell them that?
sorry?
I'm sorry. I thought that you told me the shark was caught.
and I heard it on the news. I heard it on the Cape station.
they caught a shark. Not the shark.
not the shark that killed Chrissy Watkins.
and probably not the shark that killed the little boy.
which I wanted to prove by cutting the shark open...
but you may want to let that breathe... Nothing, nothing.
you know.
you'll be the only rational man left on this island after I leave tomorrow.
where are you going?
I am going on the Aurora.
the Aurora? What is that?
it's a floating asylum for shark addicts.
it's pure research, 18 months at sea.
martin hates boats.
martin hates water.
martin sits in his car when we go on the ferry to the mainland.
I guess it's a childhood thing. There's a clinical name for it, isn't there?
drowning.
listen.
is it true that most people get attacked by sharks...
in three feet of water about 10 feet from the beach?
Yeah.
and before people started to swim for recreation...
...I mean before sharks knew what they were missing...
...that a lot of these attacks weren't reported?
that's right.
now this shark that swims alone.
rogue.
what's it called?
rogue.
rogue. Yeah.
now. This guy...
...he keeps swimmin' around in a place where the feeding is good until the food supply is gone. Right?
that's called territoriality. It's just a theory that I happen to agree with.
then why don't we have one more drink and go down and cut that shark open?
Martin, can you do that?
I can do anything. I'm the Chief of Police.
we start in the alimentary canal...
...open the digestive tract.
just like I thought.
what?
came up from the Gulf Stream from southern waters.
he didn't eat a car, did he?
no. Tiger shark's like a garbage can. It'll eat anything.
somebody probably threw that in the river.
that's it.
I've got to close the beach. Call the Mayor.
you got a bigger problem than that.
you still got a hell of a fish out there...
...with a mouth about this big.
how do we confirm that by morning?
if he is a rogue. And there's any truth to territoriality at all...
...we could spot him between Cape Scott and South Beach.
Where're you going?
I'm gooner to find him. He's a night feeder.
on the water?
we're not gonna find him on the land.
yea, but I'm not drunk enough to go on a boat.
Yes. You are.
no. I'm not!
Yes. You are.
I can't do that.
Yes. You can.
I'm tellin' you. The crime rate in New York'll kill ya.
there's so many problems. You never feel like you're accomplishing anything.
violence, Rip-offs, Muggings.
the kids can't leave the house. You've got to walk them to school.
but in Amity. One man can make a difference.
in 25 years, there's never been a shooting or a murder in this town.
no kidding? Want a pretzel?
where are we?
we're right in the stretch where he's been feeding.
can you get the Late Show on this thing?
no, it's a closed circuit TV system. I have underwater cameras fore and aft.
who pays for all this stuff? The Government? The Institute?
this stuff cost a lot of money.
well I... I paid for this mostly myself, actually.
you're kidding.
no.
you rich?
Yeah.
yea? How much?
personally or the whole family?
doesn't make any sense.
they pay a guy like you to watch sharks?
well... It doesn't make sense for a guy, who hates the water to live on an island. Either.
it's only an island if you look at it from the water.
that makes a lot of sense.
what is that thing doing?
it's a fish finder.
it's probably just a school of mackerel or something. All clumped together.
wait a minute.
there's somethin' else out there.
what is it?
about 100 yards, south, southwest.
Ben Gardner's boat, that's Ben Gardner's boat.
you know him?
it's all banged up. Sure I know him. He's a fisherman.
what happened?
look, Martin, I got to go down there and check their hull.
wait a minute. Why don't we just tow it in?
we will. I just got to check something out.
keep the lights for me.
let's tow it in.
don't worry, Martin. Nothing's gonna happen.
and what am I supposed to do while you're gone?
nothing. Absolutely nothing. Don't touch any of the equipment.
I'll be back in two minutes.
this is a great white, Larry. A big one.
any shark expert in the world will tell you it's a killer. It's a man-eater.
now the Situation is that a great white shark has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island.
he'll continue to feed here as long as there's food in the water.
and there's no limit to what he'll do.
we've had three incidents. Two people killed in a week.
it'll happen again. It happened before.
the Jersey beach. In 1916.
five people were killed In one week.
tell him about the swimmers.
a shark is attracted to the exact kind of splashing and activity...
...that occurs whenever people swim. You can't avoid it.
if you open the beaches on the Fourth of July...
...It's like ringing the dinner bell.
look, Mr. Vaughn, Mr. Vaughn
I pulled a tooth. The size of a shot glass. Out of a boat out there.
and it was the tooth of a great white.
it was Gardner's boat all chewed up.
I helped tow it. You should've seen it.
where is that tooth? Did you see it, Brody?
I didn't see it. He dropped it on the way in.
I had an accident.
and what did you say the name of this shark is?
it's a carcharodon carcharias. It's a great white.
you don't have the tooth?
look, We depend on the summer people for our lives...
you are not gonna have a summer unless you deal with this problem.
we have to close the beaches. And hire somebody to kill the shark!
I mean, we have to tell the Coast Guard.
you'll have to contact the Shark Research Panel.
you'll have to ring this entire harbor.
I don't think either one of you are familiar with our problems.
I know that you are going to ignore this problem until it swims up and bites you on the ass!
now, wait a second. There are two ways to deal with this problem.
you're either gonna kill this animal, or cut off it's food supply.
Larry, we have to close the beaches.
Brody?
sick vandalism.
that is a deliberate mutilation of a public service message.
now, I want those little paint-happy bastards caught...
...and hung up by their Buster-Browns.
that's it. Goodbye.
I won't waste my time arguing with a man who's lining up to be a hot lunch.
come on, Don't do this.
Mr. Vaughn.
what we are dealing with here is a perfect engine.
an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution.
all this machine does is swim and eat, and make little sharks. And that's all.
now, why don't you take a long, close look at this sign.
those proportions are correct.
you'd love to prove that.
get your name into the National Geographic.
Larry, Larry. If we make an effort today. We might be able to save August.
August?
for Christ sake. Tomorrow's the Fourth of July.
and we will be open for business.
this will be the best summer we've ever had.
now, if you are concerned about the beaches do what you have to. To make them safe.
but those beaches will be open for this weekend.
I want to know how many men you're going to send to me.
doctor, I don't need to come to Brisbane...
...when I have a great white shark right here.
tell me. We need men to patrol the swimming area.
we've got to have help. Anybody with a gun or a boat.
Monday!
Michigan? Michigan is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?
what? He's the little guy with a crew cut.
operator, isn't there a phone on the island?
could you connect me, please?
come on, get him!
Brody to Gotcha. Do you read me?
the guys from the TV station on the mainland are here.
all right. I'll get to them later.
Brody to Scutbucket. Please come in.
Brody to Daisy. Do you read me?
fascinating Rhythm, do you read me? Come in, Hooper.
what do you see? Nothing.
here. Martin.
and nothing on sonar.
amity Island has long been known for it's clean air. Clear water beautiful white sand beaches.
but in recent days...
...a cloud has appeared on the horizon of this beautiful resort community.
a cloud in the shape of a killer shark.
the stadium does whole of the water well, That is very shocking in the outfield.
two balls, one strike, runners at first and third...
fly ball, deep left field.
Jerry Christian goes back, running back near the wall and he takes it for the out.
Oh, Hi, Larry.
why aren't you in the water?
uh... Well...
I just put some sun tan lotion on, and I'm trying to absorb some...
nobody's going in.
please, get in the water.
Mike, come here.
listen, Mike. Do me a favor. Will you?
what?
you and the other guys take the boat and put it in the pond instead.
the pond's for old ladies.
I know it's for the old ladies, but just do it for the old man.
please?
all right.
Thanks.
I've got John.
Michael.
wait!
Michael, wait!
Michael, I don't like you no more.
I can stand Harry, you know...
Daisy, Daisy, this is Hendricks.
anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over.
Hendricks, this is Daisy here. I don't see anything.
false alarm. Must be this glare.
I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news, that we have caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers.
as you see. It's a beautiful day.
the beaches are open, and people are having a wonderful time.
"Amity." as you know. Means "friendship."
my God!
run!
Jesus Christ! Fin! Shark! 350!
get in there as fast as you can!
red one! Red one!
Martin, get them the hell out of the water. The shark is...
no whistles! No whistles!
everybody please, get out of the water.
everybody out of the water.
don't Push.
Everbady, come on! Out of the water.
how was the done, Daisy. Give an answer, please. What's going on out there?
he made me do it. He talked me into it.
please. Please, move back. Please, give these people some air.
please, move back.
martin it's just a hoax.
there are two kids with a cardboard fin.
is everyone there okay? Everyone get out of the water all right?
folks, we had some practical joker down there with a fake fin...
Shar... Shark!

no. Home, here.
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.
you got a pen, Larry?
Yeah, pen, you know.
cause you're gonna do what you do best.
you're gonna sign this voucher so I can hire a contractor.
I don't know if I can do that without...
I'm gonna hire Quint to kill the shark.
Aug...August?
what?
what are you talkin' about? Larry, summer's over.
you're the Mayor of Shark City. These people think you want the beaches open.
I was... I was acting in the town's best interest.
that's right. You were acting in the town's best interest. That's why you're gonna do the right thing.
that's why you're gonna sign this. And we're gonna pay that guy what he wants.
Martin...
my kids were on that beach, too.
sign it, Larry.
$10, 000, $200 a day, whether I catch him or not.
you've got it.
get the Mayor off my back so I don't have more zoning crap.
you've got that.
one case of apricot brandy. And you buy the lunch.
two cases. And you get dinner when you get back.
champagne, pit de foie gras, Iranian caviar...
...and don't forget the color TV.
and chief,
you try this. Made it myself. Pretty good stuff.
Thanks.
here's to swimmin' with bow-legged women.
excuse me, Chief.
can't get a good man these days. Under 60.
all gone at least 35 years.
don't drink that.
Mr. Quint...
Mr. Quint?
Mr. Quint!
you'll need an extra hand.
this is Matt Hooper. - I know who he is.
I've crewed three Trans Pacs.
transplants?
no, no, no. He's from the Oceanographic Institute. - And an America's Cup trial.
Mr. Hooper. I'm not talkin' about pleasure boatin' or day sailin'.
I'm talkin' about workin' for a living. I'm talkin' about sharkin'.
I'm not talkin' about hookin' some poor dogfish or sand shark.
I'm talkin' about finding a great white.
porkers?
talkin' about porkers? Mr. Hooper.
just tie me a sheepshank.
I haven't had to pass basic seamanship in a long time.
you didn't say how short you wanted it.
how's that?
gimme your hands.
Dogfish?
you got a $5, 000 net and you got $2, 000 worth of fish in it.
along comes Mr. Whitey. By the time he's finished with that net...
...it looks like a kiddy's scissors class has cut it up for a paper doll.
you got city hands, Mr. Hooper. You been countin' money all your life.
all right. All right. I don't need this. I don't need this working class hero crap.
you...you're not gonna do this aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint?
maybe I should go alone.
it's my party. It's my charter.
Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party. It's my vessel.
you're on board my vessel...
mate, master, pilot and I'm captain.
I'll take him for ballast, Chief.
you got him.
tail rope, eye splice, M-1, handy billy, pliers, irons.
sample bottles, dye marker, flares, safety float, temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG...
what are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?
take that stuff down below and you lash it secure. You right?
Jesus H. Christ!
when I was a boy, every squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a swordfisherman.
what have you got here? A portable shower or a monkey cage?
an anti-shark cage.
anti-shark cage?
you go inside the cage?
cage goes in the water?
you go in the water?
shark's in the water.
our shark.
farewell and adieu to you. Fair Spanish ladies
farewell and adieu. You ladies of Spain
for we've received orders for to sail back to Boston
and so never more shall we see you again
did you take your Dramamine?
Yes.
I put an extra pair of glasses in your black socks...
...and there's the stuff for your nose. The zinc oxide and Blistex is in the kit.
goddamn women today. They can't handle nothin'.
young girls just ain't quite smart like their grandmothers were.
that's got to be Quint.
colorful, isn't he?
he scares me.
don't use the fireplace in the den. Beacuse I...
what am I gonna tell the kids?
tell them I'm going fishing.
break it up. Will ya. Chief? Daylight's wastin'.
front: Bow. Back: Stern.
better get it right. Squirt...
...or I throw your ass out the little round window on the side.
come on, chief, this isn't no Boy Scout picnic.
see you got your rubbers.
here lies the body of Mary Lee.
died at the age of 103
for 15 years she kept her virginity.
not a bad record for this vicinity
all right, commissioner. Fasten your safety belt.
if you see a shark. Hooper. Swallow.
up periscope. Rig for depth charge.
stand by fire drill. Damage control report...
now, hold on Tied, Chief.
how's the Missus, Chief?
if they don't like you goin' out. They'll love you comin' in.
keep that chum line goin'. Chief. We got five good miles on it.
who's driving this boat?
nobody. The tide.
one time. I caught a 16-footer off Montauk.
had to stick two barrels in him. Two to wear him down and bring him up.
nowadays, these kids, they take out everything.
radar, Sonar,
electric toothbrushes.
Jesus H. Christ.
chief. Best drop another chum marker.
damn it, Martin!
this is compressed air.
what the hell kind of a knot was that?
you pulled the wrong one.
you screw around with these tanks. And they're gonna blow up.
Yeah, that's real fine expensive gear you've brought out here. Mr. Hooper.
I don't know what that bastard shark's gonna do with it.
might eat it, I suppose. Seen one eat a rockin' chair one time.
next time, you just ask me which line to pull, right?
little brown eel comes out of the cave...
...swims into the hole...
...comes out of the hole, back into the cave again.
it's not too good, is it? Chief.
well. Nothin's easy, is it? One more time.
Hey!
I got it.
what?
get behind me.
Hooper, reverse her!
takin' a hell of a lot of line.
get the scoop out of the bucket, wet the reel.
Hooper! Reverse her!
duck your head down, chief! We're swingin'. Get behind me again.
no more water. I don't want you to drown me.
Hooper, you idiot. Starboard! Ain't you watchin' it!
Hooper, neutral.
Where'd he go now?
he ain't foolin' me.
what's he yankin' on now?
go on, try it.
I don't know, Chief. If he's very smart or very dumb.
he's gone under.
he's gone under the boat. I think he's gone under the boat.
Yes, it's too easy.
he is a smart big fish. He's gone under the boat.
keep her steady, Now. I got somethin' very big.
I don't think so.
chief.
put your gloves on.
you put your gloves on, both of you.
getting ready to run out again.
Hey, Quint, let it go.
Hey, Hooper.
may be big in the lab. But out here you're just cargo.
if you don't want to backstroke home. You get down here.
all right, You don't want to listen to me. Don't listen now.
it's not a shark.
the wire's showing, The wire's showing!
unbuckle me.
get the other side.
it's a tuna or swordfish.
waste of time.
OK. Take this rod.
Hooper, give the Chief a hand, will you?
right!
Oh, shit!
it's a marlin or a stingray...
...but it's definitely a game fish.
gamin' fish?
marlin, stingray bit through this piano wire?
don't you tell me my business again.
you get back on the bridge. - Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing.
it proves one thing, Mr. Hooper.
it proves that you wealthy college boys...
don't have the education enough to admit when you're wrong.
what's the point? Hooks and lines?
you lose one. You rig one.
Hooper.
twelve minutes, south, southeast, now. Full throttle.
aye, sir! Aye...
you see. What I do, Chief, is trick 'em to the surface.
and then jab at 'em.
I'm not gonna haul 'em up like a lot of catfish.
Hooper, Full throttle.
I don't have to take this abuse much longer.
your head's bleeding.
first aid there.
Brody?
start that chum line again, will ya?
let Hooper take a turn.
Hooper drives the boat, chief.
stop playin' with yourself, Hooper.
slow ahead. If you please.
you heard him? Slow ahead.
slow ahead.
I can go slow ahead. Come on down and chum some of this shit.
you're gonna need a bigger boat.
shut off that engine.
that's a 20-footer.
twenty-five.
three tons of him.
we're gonna need a bigger boat, right?
gotta get to work.
how do we handle this? How do we handle this?
come up front, Martin, I need you.
he's circling the boat.
amity Point Light Station to Orca. This is Amity Point Light Station to Orca.
come in, Orca.
orca. Come in.
I have Mrs. Martin Brody here.
put her on.
come on. Martin! Move, move, move!
I'm not goin' out there!
beyond the edge of the barrels. Go to the end of the barrels.
further out.
what?
further out.
Why?
go further out.
what for?
will you go to the end of the pulpit, please?
what? - Will you go to the end of the pulpit?
what for?
I need something in the foreground to give it some scale.
foreground my ass!
your husband's okay. He's fishin'. He just caught some stripers.
we'll bring 'em for dinner. We won't be long. We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.
I'm not staying here! - I'm begging you! Martin, goddamn it!
come here. Darlin'. Come here. Darlin'.
chief, I want you up on the bridge. Just take her forward. Steady.
I've never steered a boat in my life.
just watch my hand. Take her steady.
Mr. Hooper, attach the end of this line to the first keg.
I've got to get a good shot at that porker's head.
he's coming.
Hooper? Get clear of the bow.
Hooper!
tied up, will ya?
your turn, Quint.
Hooper, where are you?
Hooper. Hurry it up now. Tie it on.
hurry it up. He's comin' straight for us! Don't screw up now.
don't wait for me.
come on. Hooper. Come on. Hurry it up. Tie it on.
kill it! Quint, kill it!
now!
shoot!
time.
what were you doin'. Anyway? I didn't get a clean shot right in the head.
all right, let's see how long that barrel takes to bring him up.
free another barrel. I'm comin' around again.
what do we do now? We're quittin', right?
we got one barrel on him. We stay out here until we find him again.
yea, But we could radio in and get a bigger boat...
Hey.
don't you worry about it, Chief.
it won't be permanent.
you want to see something permanent?
you want to feel somethin' permanent?
just put your hand underneath my cap. You feel that little lump?
Knocko Nolans, St. Paddy's Day, Boston.
I got that beat.
I got that beat.
it's a moray eel.
it bit right through my wet suit.
well, Hoop, now, listen
I don't know about that, but I...
entered an arm wrestlin' contest in an Oakie bar in San Francisco.
see this? I can't extend that. You know why?
cause in the semi-final celebrating my third wife's demise...
...big Chinese fella. He pulled me right over.
look at that.
that's a bull shark.
he scraped me when I was takin' samples.
I got something for you.
there's a thresher. You see that? A thresher's tail.
Thresher?
it's a shark.
you want a drink? Drink to your leg?
I'll drink to your leg.
OK. So we drink to our legs.
I got the crime de la crime.
right here. Hold on.
here, you see that?
you're wearin' a sweater.
right there, Mary Ellen Moffit.
she broke my heart.
what's that one?
what?
that one, there. On your arm.
Oh... A tattoo. I got that removed.
don't tell me. Don't tell me. "Mother."
what is it?
Mr. Hooper, that's the U. S.S. Indianapolis.
you were on the Indianapolis?
what happened?
japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief.
I was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte just delivered the bomb.
the Hiroshima bomb.
1, 100 men went into the water.
vessel went down in 12 minutes.
didn't see the first shark for about half an hour.
tiger, 13-footer. Know how you know that when you're in the water, chief?
you tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail.
well, We didn't know.
because our bomb mission had been so secret...
...no distress signal had been sent.
they didn't even list us overdue for a week.
very first light. Chief. Sharks come cruisin'...
...so we formed ourselves into tight groups.
it was... kinda like old squares in a battle like you see on a calendar like the Battle of Waterloo.
the idea was.
the shark comes to the nearest man...
and he starts poundin' hollerin' and screamin'.
sometimes the shark would go away...
...but sometimes he wouldn't go away.
sometimes that shark. He looks right into you...
...right into your eyes.
you know. A thing about a shark. He's got...
...lifeless eyes, black eyes. Like a doll's eyes.
when he comes at you. He doesn't seem to be livin'...
...until he bites you.
those little black eyes roll over white and then...
...then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'.
the ocean turns red...
...in spite of the poundin' and the hollerin'. They all come in.
they rip you to pieces.
you know. By the end of that first dawn...
...we lost 100 men.
I don't know how many sharks. Maybe 1, 000.
I don't know how many men. They averaged six an hour.
on Thursday mornin'. Chief.
I bumped into a friend of mine... Herbie Robinson from Cleveland.
baseball player, bosun's mate.
I thought he was asleep.
reached over to wake him up.
he bobbed up and down in the water just like a kind of top.
upended.
well.
he'd been bitten in half. Below the waist.
noon the fifth day. Mr. Hooper.
a Lockheed Ventura saw us. He swung in low and he saw us.
he was a young pilot. Younger than Mr. Hooper.
anyway, He saw us and he came in low.
and three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and starts to pick us up.
you know. That was... the time I was most frightened.
waitin' for my turn.
I'll never put on a life jacket again.
so 1, 100 men went into the water...
...316 men come out.
the sharks took the rest June the 29th, 1945.
anyway.
we delivered the bomb.
what's that?
it's a whale.
farewell and adieu to you.
fair Spanish ladies
farewell and adieu.
you ladies of Spain
show me the way to go home
I'm tired and I want to go to bed
I had a little drink about an hour ago
and it's gone right to my head
wherever I may roam
by land or sea or foam
show me the way to go home
I'm tired and I want to go to bed
I had a little drink about a hour ago. And it's gone right to my head
wherever I may roam
on land or sea or foam
you can always hear me singing this...
start the engines.
fire her up!
chief, put out the fire, will ya?
pump her out.
done.
everybody on deck.
he ate the light.
terrific.
excuse me.
Quint, what are you doing? Don't waste your time, Quint, come on.
what's wrong with this?
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that. Watch for him.
you okay?
Hey, Martin.
are you okay?
Hey, Chief, more left rudder.
pull your left hand down.
I can't. It'll only go about three inches.
all of our injectors got scored from the salt water in the fuel.
Yeah, the housing's bent. You can hear it.
try the left rudder again. Will ya?
more left. Good. Once again now.
Quint, Quint, there it is.
what do you say, Chief?
the barrel is up. It's right in the stern.
I think he's right under the keg. Grab the boat hook.
Quint, if we can get close enough...
...I've got things on board that'll kill it.
just want to goose him up. Come on.
when he runs, you drop that rope or you'll lose your hands.
I've seen fingers torn out at the knuckles.
whole sea's bones full of 'em. Give it to me a minute.
haul in that line or it'll foul us.
start the engine.
where are you goin'?
I'm gonna make a phone call.
Hello? Hello?
Hello, Mayday. Orca. Coast Guard?
coast Guard. This is the Orca. Do you read me?
coast Guard. This is the Orca. Do you...
excuse me, Chief.
that's great. That's just great.
now, where the hell are we, eh?
you're certifiable. Quint, you know that?
you're certifiable!
yea, Yea.
you're certifiable!
but I'll tell you this! - Boys.
I think he's come back for his noon feeding.
hook me up another barrel.
bring her around after him.
full throttle. Get me right up alongside of him.
I can't rev it up that high. It's not gonna take it.
five degrees port.
all right, hold your course.
five degrees port now.

hard aport.
watch him. Starboard! Starboard!
I can't believe it. Two barrels and he's going down again.
it's incredible.
they're up again!
now what?
why don't we lead the shark into shore instead of him leading us out to sea?
grab a couple of poles.
okey?
hang on now. We're going around.
into starboard.
easy.
I'm gonna back her off now. Keep a watch on it, boys. Watch him.
all right, gentlemen, snag them.
now then tie them to the stern cleats.
Brody, bring your end around the cleat.
that's right. It'll lock itself off.
give him room, Brody.
give him...
stay clear of the line.
watch it. Stand clear.
stand away from those stern cleats.
back home we got a taxidermy man.
he gonna have a heart attack when he sees what I brought him.
throttle back. You're losing the cleats.
look that, My God. This one, too. They're both going.
he's eating his way through that line.
yea, He's working his way right up to us.
Quint!
come on, Quint! Come on, hurry!
Quint!
out of my way.
watch it.
untie this. He'll pull out the transom.
make it fast! We got another line in him!
I can't. It's trying to run.

I hope your back breaks!

he can't stay down with three barrels on him.
not with three barrels. He can't.
what about us?
Hooper, Get the pump out of the locker in front of you, will you?
we're gonna sink, aren't we?
Hooper, Keep an eye on the barrels.
pump it out, Chief.
starting to go under.
he can't with three barrels on him. Not with three he can't.
you ever have one do this before?
no.
he's chasin' us. I don't believe it.
I'm gonna draw him into the shallows.
draw him into the shallow water. I'm gonna draw him in and drown him.
we're headin' in, Brody.
thank Christ!

no.
how far do we have to go?
Quint, Don't put that much pressure on it.
goddamn it.
shut up. Get back there.
hold on.
farewell and adieu to you. Fair Spanish ladies
farewell and adieu. You ladies of Spain
for we received order for to sail back to Boston
you idiot. You burned out the bearings.
all right stop the boat. Stop the boat.
stop it.
hoop, What exactly can you do with these things of yours?
I think I can pump 20 cc of strychnine nitrate into him.
if I can get close enough.
get this little needle through his skin?
no, I can't do that.
if I can get him close to the cage. I can get him in the mouth.
that shark'll rip that cage to pieces.
you got any better suggestions?
easy.
easy.
all right, go.
up she goes.
ain't got no spit.
try and keep him off me until I'm lower.
okay, okay, I'm ready.

I think the tide's with us.

I used to hate the water.
I can't imagine why.
Hello!
Yes, this is Harold Angel.
Yes, initial A, like in the phone book.
excuse me?
hold on a second!
mackintosh. I've got it!
of course I know what an attorney is.
it's like a lawyer, only the bills are bigger.
sure, I'll hold.
asshole!
Hello, Mr. Winesap? Harold Angel.
Yeah, I could be free.
would this be with your firm?
gimme that again.
Louis . . . how do you spell that?
Cyphre . . . okay. What is it . . . foreign?
is your client a foreigner?
Mr. Winesap, could you give me a few more details?
okay, I know the place.
it's a long way up, but I can be there.
Hallelujah! Show right now how much you love God!
I want you to show! It's your time!
open up your hearts and open up your wallets!
open your purses!
open your pockets!
and give it up! Praise the Lord! Somebody has been talking about me riding around in a Cadillac. If you love me and want to give to me, then I should be in a Rolls-Royce!
would you come with me, please?
an unfortunate husband of one of Pastor John's flock took a gun to his head. Most unpleasant.
Mr. Angel? Please?
allow me to introduce my client, Monsieur Louis Cyphre.
Hi, Harry Angel. - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Angel.
I don't want to appear impolite, but do you have any l. D? - Sure! Here . . .
how's that?
gun PERMIT
nothing personal. I'm a little over-cautious.
you know how these things are. - I know. So . . .
how did you hear about me?
I guess you guys just looked in the phone book.
usually that's what happens. Because my name is "Angel," it's under "A" . . .
people are lazy. They see the first name and . . . - Johnny Favorite.
excuse me?
do you by chance remember the name Johnny Favorite?
Johnny . . . no, I don't think so.
you never knew him? - Am I supposed to?
he was a crooner before the war, quite famous in his way.
well, I tell you, Mr. Cyphre . . .
I'm sorry!
I usually don't get involved in anything very heavy. I usually handle insurance jobs, divorces, things of that nature.
if I'm lucky sometimes I handle people. But I don't know no crooners or anybody famous. - His real name was Liebling.
I don't know any Liebling, either.
what do you want from me?
does this man owe you money? - Not quite.
I helped Johnny at the beginning of his career.
you were like . . . his agent?
No!
nothing so . . .
Monsieur Cyphre has a contract.
certain collateral was to be forfeited in the event of his death.
,and his head and face was badly injured.
he had . . . - Amnesia. I think you call it . . .
shell shock. - Exactly! - I know how that feels.
Why? Were you in the services? - I was in for a short time.
but I got a little fucked up.
excuse me! They shipped me home, and I missed the whole shebang:
the war, the medals, everything. I guess you could say I was lucky.
Johnny wasn't so lucky. He returned home a zombie.
his friends had him transferred to a private hospital upstate.
there was some sort of radical psychiatric treatment involved.
but you know how it is.
he remained a vegetable, and my contract was never honored. - I see.
I don't want to sound mercenary.
my only interest in Johnny is in finding out if he's alive or dead.
each year my office receives a signed affidavit confirming that Johnny Liebling is indeed among the living.
but last weekend Monsieur Cyphre and l, just by chance, were near the clinic in Poughkeepsie.
we decided to check for ourselves, but we got misleading information.
the run-around!
I didn't want to cause a scene, I hate any sort of fuss.
I thought, perhaps you could subtly and in a quiet manner . . .
you want me to check it out. - Check it out!
I have a feeling I've met you before.
I don't know, I don't think so.
do you remember the name Johnny Favorite?
his real name was Liebling.
my only interest in Johnny is in finding out if he's alive or dead.
may I help you? - My name is Harry Conroy from the National lnstitute of Health.
is there anyone in particular you want to see?
the lnstitute is conducting a survey of incurable trauma cases.
I understand you have a patient here fitting that description?
we can't let you see anyone without an appointment.
I appreciate that, but maybe you could check the files and make sure I'm on the right track.
I don't want to bother anybody unnecessarily.
okay? Thank you.
what's the name of the patient? - Liebling, Jonathan Liebling.
one moment please, I'll check.
were you working here last weekend?
no, day off. - Did you do anything nice?
my sister's wedding.
we did have a Mr. Liebling, but he was transferred.
you sure? - That's what it says.
and when was that? - Years ago, in December '43.
may I take a look at this? Thanks.
is this recent?
it's an old file. - It's in ballpoint!
they weren't big on ballpoint in '43.
is that ballpoint?
well, I'll be! They didn't have ballpoints back then?
no.
this here
Dr. Fowler, does he still work here? - Just part-time, he's old.
thank you.
time for your evening fix?
who are you? How did you get in here?
through the mailslot. I'm a private detective.
breaking and entering is a crime, whoever or whatever you are. - Hey man, call the police!
which you won't do in case they discover your opium den in the icebox!
I'm a doctor. I'm perfectly entitled to keep pharmaceuticals at home.
tell it to somebody else! We're not talking about a Band-Aid or a tube of unguent. How long you been hooked? - What do you want?
information about Johnny Liebling.
I treated a patient of that name many years ago.
I'm not fooling around.
either you give me some answers or I'll call the police myself.
I've seen the works cooking upstairs, and it ain't Mr. Salk's vaccine.
he was an entertainer during the war, a neuro case.
no chance of recovery, so I transferred him to a V. A. hospital in Albany.
I hate to shake you up, but I checked, and he's not there.
you faked the transfer.
because he recently had a visitor, the first in 12 years.
popular guy, eh?
where is he now? - I don't know . . . - Come here!
I haven't seen him since he was a patient here.
you're in a cold sweat! Look at you!
you can't wait for me to leave so you can raid the icebox.
the sooner you get out with it, the sooner you can shoot up.
I'll ask you again: Where is he?
I don't know.
some people came one night years ago. He got in the car with them and left.
he got into a car? I thought this guy was a vegetable.
at first he was in a coma but he quickly recovered.
but he still suffered from amnesia.
the friends.
who were the friends? - His name was Kelley, Edward Kelley.
the young lady I don't know. She stayed in the car.
where did they take him? - Down South. The man said: "We're taking him home."
and what was the deal? - $25, 000.
for what? - I was supposed to pretend that he was still a patient in hospital.
didn't the administration suspect? - Why should they? I kept the charts up to date. And no one asks questions when the bills get paid.
tell me about Johnny Liebling.
what did he look like? - No idea. His face was damaged.
he had facial reconstruction. He was in bandages the day he left.
what can you tell me about Kelley?
it's too long ago. I only have a vague memory.
he was well dressed and had a southern accent.
I truly don't remember. - All right, Doc. Have a lie down.
I'm going out to grab a cheeseburger.
maybe a few hours cold turkey will refresh your memory.
watch yourself!
we're going to take a little nap, sit your ass down.
we're going to clear your mind.
I'm going out. When I get back,
I'll fix you some goodies from the icebox, alright?
tell me what I want to know and you'll get rid of me forever.
I'm back, Doc! I brought you a little something!
I didn't think you'd want a cheeseburger . . .
I will! Bye!
Hi, Ellie!
is that your boyfriend?
he's got a car and everything?
see you later!
did you see him? - No.
why not? - It would've been difficult. - Why?
Why? Because he's not there.
Johnny Favorite walked out of the clinic 1 2 years ago, in his best suit, with a new face wrapped in bandages and a headache.
he left with a guy called Kelley and a girl. Do you know this Kelley?
it seems this Kelley paid off some bent doctor called Fowler to pinch hit for your guy. He's covered up for him all these years.
looks like our Johnny has a perfect disappearing act. - It seems so.
but you know what they say about slugs.
no, what do they say about slugs?
they always leave slime in their tracks.
you'll find him. - No, I won't find him.
because I left out one little detail.
this Dr. Fowler ended up dead with his fucking brains blown out.
did you kill him? - No!
but the cops might think I did.
I took on a $1 25-a-day missing persons job for you.
now, I'm a murder suspect. That's it! I'm out.
such are the hazards of your profession. If the fee bothers you, we'll adjust it.
you bother me!
the closest I ever come to death is watching a hearse go by on 2nd Avenue. That's the way I like it.
are you afraid?
Yeah, I'm afraid.
I'll instruct my lawyer immediately to send you a check for $5, 000.
if you don't want the job, I'll engage someone else.
you want this Johnny pretty bad, eh?
I don't like messy accounts.
some religions think the egg is the symbol of the soul, did you know that?
no.
would you like an egg?
no, thank you. I got a thing about chickens.
it's after eleven, you're late. - I'm sorry.
you get it? - If I lose my job,
I'll come and be your secretary.
I couldn't pay you what the "Times" pays. Besides, they won't miss it.
Hi, Johnny, where the fuck are you?
he really was a crooner, like you said. I didn't realize he was so big.
he was in a band called the Spider Simpson Orchestra. They're all dead.
only Spider is here in town. - Where? - I wrote it all down.
the dyke in the archive is suspicious.
my boss hasn't researched the story in years.
you can get the files.
spider is in an old people's home on 138th Street.
Oh, I get to go to Harlem again.
there was a picture of Johnny with Toots Sweet, a guitar player.
no one's heard of him for years!
Johnny was engaged to a rich broad,
Margaret Krusemark. Her dad owns half of Louisiana.
met him at a high school prom. Johnny shit on her, and she went back to Daddy.
there's lots on their spells.
spells, what do you mean, spells?
the eye of a newt, toe of a frog and that kind of shit? - Seems she was a bit of a crackpot.
casting spells at society do's and stuff.
didn't go down too well with the lvy League stiffos.
she was known as the Witch of Wellesly.
did I do good?
great! So what've I got: A religious loonie as a client.
I gotta find Johnny "Golden Tonsils" and we don't know where he is.
and he probably doesn't know who he is.
I got a geriatric bandleader in a home in Harlem.
I got a guitar player called Toots Sweet.
what else have I got?
a hard-on?
are you okay?
january 3rd, 1 955. Client: Louis Cyphre. Copy: Winesap & Mackintosh, attorneys. As reported, Johnny Favorite has not been in the Sarah Dodd Clinic in Poughkeepsie for the last 12 years.
he was taken away by a man called Edward Kelley and a girl.
the girl is unidentified.
kelley paid a Dr. Fowler $25, 000 to falsify reports stating that Favorite was still in the hospital.
the doctor is now deceased.
before Johnny's accident it seemed like his career was going great, until he started to dump on everyone. I tracked down Spider Simpson,
Johnny's old bandleader. He resides at the Lincoln Presbyterian Hospice on 1 38th Street. Johnny also had a good buddy, a guitar player called Toots Sweet. Toots went back to Algiers.
that's Algiers in New Orleans.
I think maybe Margaret went back there, and maybe Johnny, too.
Oh, yeah! According to Spider, Johnny had a secret love.
a black lady called Evangeline Proudfoot.
Evangeline ran some kind of spooky store in Harlem called "Mammy Carter's.
you don't need to know that, Cyphre. I think a secret love should stay secret.
the only person who Johnny was seeing regularly was a palm reader in Coney lsland called Madame Zora.
are you lzzy?
looks like the last bit of sun, eh?
the guy in the arcade over there told me you might be able to help me.
I'm looking for Madame Zora. - I know her, friend of the wife before the war.
she was a fortune teller, right? - And then some!
I hate those hocus-pocus bitches! Her and the wife got along real well.
wife's a baptist. Oh, here!
have a nose shield!
go on, take one. I found a whole boxful under the boardwalk.
there's not much sun right now.
Yeah, but it keeps the rain off too.
ever hear of a Johnny Favorite?
the singer? - Yeah, he used to visit Madame Zora.
heard of him, but don't know nothing. Ask the wife.
she always sings stupid tunes off the radio. She knows all that shit.
she likes the water, eh? - She hates it.
she's getting on the heavy side. She thinks it's good for varicose veins.
alright, thanks.
what do you do here in the summer?
bite the heads off the rats.
and in the winter? - The same.
excuse me!
I was just talking to your husband.
I was inquiring about Madame Zora.
Yeah, I knew her before the war, Madame Zora, you say?
Yeah, she was a gypsy fortune teller!
had the booth across the boardwalk from me. She was a debutante not a gypsy, and she did more than just read tea leaves.
did you ever see her with a guy called Johnny Favorite? - Yeah, he was cute.
she was stuck on him. He was called "Golden Tonsils." I knew all his tunes.
have you ever heard of a Margaret Krusemark?
don't be a gazoony, fellah! Madame Zora was Margaret Krusemark.
well what happened to her?
packed up her stuff and went back home, down south.
you have any idea where I could find Johnny Favorite?
no, maybe the cemetery. Want to hear one of his tunes?
thanks for the nose shield. I'm going to need it where I'm going.
in Brooklyn? - Louisiana. - Nice.
Where'd he go?
for COLORED PATRONS ON LY
Mr. Angel? Sorry to keep you waiting, but you're a little early.
I had a bad line. I didn't know if you said 4: 00 or 4: 30.
this is a wild place you got here! - Yes, I've been very happy here.
I've never had my fortune read before. Does it take long?
I'll take the details now. It usually takes a couple of days to do a chart.
tea?
do you want some tea?
Yes, thank you.
darjeeling, jasmine or oolong?
not many people like oolong.
do you play the piano?
no, not exactly.
sing?
I can carry a tune, but no . . . not really.
who is this mean looking guy?
my father.
I'm sorry!
don't worry, he hates it too.
he looks like one of those guys in an old pirate movie. What's his name?
well, I tell you, I never saw any of Ethan's movies.
do you speak French?
I'm from Brooklyn.
I would prefer it if you didn't smoke. - That's okay.
cream or sugar?
straight up is fine, thank you.
I need your exact date of birth.
sure!
I was born on February 14th . . .
. . . 1918, on Valentine's day.
how curious! I used to know a boy who was born on that exact same day.
well, you know how it is.
maybe we could pull your friend's chart and save ourselves some time.
I don't think so. Every person is very different. I don't think you'd like his chart.
place of birth?
Brooklyn, New York. Was your friend a jerk or something?
you could say that.
I guess you didn't get along.
you and Johnny.
you and Johnny Favorite?
who are you? - I was an old army buddy.
I thought you two were kinda . . .
look, I ain't no army buddy, I'm just a guy who was paid to snoop around.
to tell the truth, I wasn't born on Valentine's day.
it's Johnny's future I'm interested in.
Johnny has no future, he's dead.
he died 1 2 years ago. I'd like you to leave.
I know you're thinking who is this creep poking his snitch in everything.
I don't want to sound nosy, but . . . - He's dead, Mr. Angel.
and if he isn't, he is to me.
he must've hurt you pretty bad!
we all have our scars.
I don't know too much about the guy, but he must've been stupid to let you go.
lies and cruelty come very easily to some people.
pity, I really would've liked to have gotten my palm read.
then I could have held your hand just a little longer.
I don't think you'd like what I see.
very pretty necklace!
you got any High John the Conquerer root? - Powdered or hanging?
I'm not really sure.
caught in the rain, eh?
two roots, $1 . 20.
I have a question. I had an acquaintance in Harlem who used to deal in the root.
name was Evangeline. Heard of her?
practically everyone around here is called Evangeline. After the poem.
do you know it?
Yeah, I know it.
this acquaintance had a store in Harlem and it was the same name:
Carter." - Everybody uses the name, mister.
like "Howard Johnson," but this is the real place.
her name was Proudfoot.
I knew her. She used to come back all the time when she lived in New York.
do you know where she is now? - She got sick and died.
she went back to the Holy Shelter swamp and was buried in Armandville.
she was waiting on some fellah. - Just like in the poem? - Yep.
who was the guy? - She never told.
okay, thanks.
a week, you say? - At the most.
what is it?
why are you crying?
we're going to Grandma. What's there?
grandma.
grandma.
let's go.
give me your hand.
I'm sorry! I got these off a guy in Coney lsland.
some crazy guy.
I'm sorry.
stop crying.
I was hoping I could talk with your mother.
you're a little late. Did you know her?
no, I never met her but I was hoping she could answer some questions for me.
are you a cop?
no, my name is Harry Angel.
I'm a private detective.
so what's . . ? - Epiphany.
your mama left you with a very beautiful name.
and not much else.
actually, I'm looking for a friend of your mother's, a guy called Johnny Favorite.
I met all her friends but never anyone called Favorite.
shit!
I got a thing about chickens.
this Favorite was friends with your mother in New York city before the war.
well, she never told me. Mama had a lot of guys. She liked men.
how about a guy called Toots Sweet?
he was a friend of Favorite. Know him? - No. - He was a good guitar player.
I was going to catch his act tonight.
I'm going to be staying in town, in a hotel.
if you remember anything that might help me, give me a call.
you're a very pretty girl, Epiphany, your name suits you.
these crazy chickens!
what are you after him for, Johnny Favorite?
I'm not after him. I'm just being paid to find out where he is.
he could be 6 feet under. - Then I'll have to buy a shovel.
how are you, sugar?
some beautiful tune you were singing there, Mr. Sweet. - Toots, son! Thanks. - Buy you a drink?
mine's on the house. Special cocktail. Whatever's in it gives a big kick.
you know, I heard you play years ago in New York.
before the war at the old Dickie Wells Bar.
you were having it up pretty good with a guy called Johnny Favorite.
Yeah, I vaguely remember. - You and he were buddies, weren't you?
no, he recorded one of my songs. Say, are you a dick or a book writer?
neither. I'm a journalist and I'm doing this piece about Johnny and the Spider Simpson Orchestra.
spider played them drums like two jackrabbits fucking!
haven't got much time. Got to piss, spit and get back to work.
try one of those cocktails. Then you can make the whole thing up as you like.
that's what you usually do, anyway.
I can't even take a piss!
I just wanted to talk about Johnny Favorite and Evangeline Proudfoot.
I'm too big to go hiding under beds. I don't know nothing.
I'm only interested in cocktails. Fuck!
what's going on? - Nothing! Mind your own business. I want to piss!
get outta here, or you'll wish your little white ass was never born.
please! I've got a thing about chickens.
end of bullshit time!
I've had a good look at you and young Epiphany doing your hot shoe number with the chicken.
listen!
I ain't up on this voodoo shit. I'm from Brooklyn.
we ain't all Baptists here. - What's with this Proudfoot girl?
she's a mambo priestess, like her mom. Has been since she was 1 3.
when was the last time you saw Johnny Favorite at a chicken dance?
he used to run around with Ma mambo. - I ain't seen him since before the war.
and the chicken foot in the john? - It means I got a big mouth.
it's not big enough. What's this fucking star in your mouth? I'll tell you what.
I'll give you my hotel number. Gimme a call if you hear anything.
you never know.
next time you get a delivery of a chicken foot, you might need help.
as far as I'm concerned, any dead chicken is a good chicken.
only cops and bad news don't knock.
only private dicks sleep late.
quite a dream you were having! - I was on my way to Mandalay.
shit! There's some leak up there!
here! ls this your name?
that your hotel?
you're standing in it, ain't you? - Your handwriting?
I think so.
then perhaps you can tell us why we found it in the hand of a dead guitar player.
Toots Sweet is dead?
this one wasn't so quick, this one took time.
how did he die?
technically? Asphyxiation by his own genitalia.
and not so technically?
they cut his dick off and choked him with it.
then redecorated his apartment with his blood.
when did you see him? - I interviewed him around 1: 00. - About what?
a missing person.
who?
a guy who took a walk 1 2 years ago.
there was a photo of him and Toots. - Who is the party you're looking for?
I can't say. I'm working for a New York lawyer.
name? - Come on, man!
Winesap! You want his number, his address?
ask Tess Truehart over there, it's in the book.
under "W," genius! - Do you know Ted Williams, the baseball player?
alright, is that it, guys?
that's it.
you can go eat lunch, but don't stroll too far.
not until we talk to this lawyer.
ever watch the "Mickey Mouse Club"?
do you know what today is?
today is Wednesday.
it's "anything can happen" day.
hey man, do you want a tune?
Yeah, I got a tune for you.
Hiya, boys!
I'm getting kinda hungry.
do you want to sell some of those?
10 cents a sack. - Sure, give me a sack.
listen good! Margaret Krusemark's old man wants you on the first train home.
take that fucking thing away from me!
don't, or the dog will bite your fucking face clean off.
what happened to you?
a dog bit me.
so, what do you want?
right now, I need a laundry.
listen, Epiphiny . . . - Epiphany.
there's something I want to ask you.
the other night I saw you and Toots boogying with the cock-a-doodle.
looked like you were having some party.
what's your problem? It's a free country.
not for chickens. - Oh yeah, your thing about chickens.
listen, Toots is . . .
Toots is dead. - I know, I heard.
you set him up. - No, I didn't.
you were the only one that knew I was seeing Toots.
you sent the gift-wrapped chicken foot, didn't you?
Toots had a big mouth.
I guess he did, judging by what the cops found in it.
quite a cute religion! - Nailing a man to a cross ain't so cute either!
you've got to kill the chicken to make the soup, eh?
we don't go around murdering people. What about your Johnny Favorite?
now you remember him after all. - Yes, he was my father.
I'll pick the baby up later, okay? - He'll be all right.
anything you're holding out, now is a good time to tell.
nothing to tell.
Johnny never came back from the war.
mama waited and Mama died. Sad and simple.
there's too many dead bodies floating around, even for Louisiana.
I'd tell your old man to look out for you.
you do have a husband? - No.
no?
Jesus, you've got beautiful eyes!
really.
the kind of eyes that tell what's going on inside.
right now, you're scared. - I'll manage.
listen . . . - Yes, I'll call you if I hear anything.
call me if you don't.
alright?
I have a message for you.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I'm so glad you could come. - I didn't know you were in town.
I'm speaking in Baton Rouge and thought I'd catch up on your progress.
I'll tell you, the progress ain't too good.
I've found out a lot of stuff, but so far . . . no Johnny Favorite.
how unfortunate! - All I've got is a belly full of hocus-pocus and . . .
3 stiffs.
dead bodies, Mr. Cyphre.
murders.
I got Fowler, Johnny's doctor, bumped himself off.
this old voodoo guy Toots Sweet.
he got choked to death with a part of the body meant for pissing with . . .
this is a church!
the whole thing has to do with religion. It's very weird.
I don't understand it. It's ugly.
they say there's enough religion to make men hate each other but not love.
do they say that?
I'll tell you something. There wasn't much love around for Johnny Favorite.
he was bad luck!
it's starting to rub off on me. I'm a murder suspect already in two cases.
the police found my name and my address in Toots Sweets' hand.
I know, Winesap told me. You must be careful, Mr. Angel.
and the third murder?
I checked out Johnny's old society girlfriend, Margaret Krusemark.
do you know her? - Vaguely.
Vaguely? I'm a little fed up with fucking vaguely.
Vaguely" is putting a noose around my neck and I'm choking, so . . .
did you know her or not?
I knew about her, but I never actually knew her.
tell you what, she was doing my chart.
I gave her Johnny's birthday, February 14th.
except someone got to her and took out their own Valentine's card.
they slit her open and cut out her heart.
I guess she couldn't predict the future for herself.
the future isn't what it used to be.
and your conclusions? - I haven't any.
all I know is that Johnny is running around bumping off everyone he knew.
and more and more, it's me who's on the line for it.
I'm being set up and it's scaring the shit out of me.
so why don't you just level with me and tell me what the fuck is going on?
just Johnny Favorite and the debt that's owed to me.
I have old-fashioned ideas, about honour.
an eye for an eye, things like that.
who the fuck are you?
watch your language!
I don't give a fuck, if this is a church.
I don't like churches. - Are you an atheist?
Yes, I'm from Brooklyn.
I'll be in town for a day or two, let me know what else you find, and if you need more money . . . - No!
but if I'm not careful, that 5, 000 bucks you gave me could buy me a seat on the electric chair.
frightened eyes never lie.
come on! Come inside!
Where's your child? - He's at Mincie's. She'll bring him.
she's got 14 of her own, so he'll be okay there.
you're welcome to stay here, or I can get you a room.
no, it's okay.
I'm going to have a drink. Want one?
well, have one anyway.
I've been thinking . . .
what the hell did your mother see in a guy like Johnny Favorite?
I don't know. Whatever he had, it sure stole her heart away.
to tell you the truth, the guy was a creep.
she sure missed him.
what does a lady see in a guy who runs around chopping up pigeons?
they say it's always the bad-asses who make a girl's heart beat faster.
did she ever say anything about him?
just two things. - What?
that Johnny Favorite was as close to true evil as she ever wanted to come.
what else?
that he was a terrific lover.
how old are you?
kind of young to have a kid, isn't it?
old enough.
where did the father go? - I never knew him.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I took this room.
I can't believe this!
it was a Bambouche. When spirits possess you, it's called "chevalier."
I know that: Chevrolet.
Chevalier. - That's what I said: Chevrolet. - Mounted by the gods.
so the gods got you pregnant? I understand now. I'm sorry.
I'm not. It was the best fuck I ever had.
want to dance?
here?
Yes, here.
I got bit by a dog this morning, I can't move around.
you won't feel a thing.
alright, I'll dance with you.
but you've got to promise. - What's that? - No chickens!
alright, I'm coming!
I should've recognised the knock.
at least you got a reason for sleeping late.
down here we don't mess with jigaboos. The colored folks keep to themselves.
I'm not from down here. - You cut yourself?
dog bit me.
somebody called Margaret Krusemark figure in your missing persons case?
no, why? - She's dead. That nigger guitar player of yours, he didn't matter a shit. He was into voodoo.
but this Krusemark dame, she comes from a Louisiana money family.
two people bumped off in a week, what's the connection?
similar circumstances!
did she have her dick cut off too? - No!
some fucker cut her heart out, neat as a butcher.
look, mine's a missing persons, it's not a murder.
I want the name of the party you're looking for. - Talk to the lawyer.
I did. A fancy mouthpiece, gave me the same big city shit as you.
what should I say? Why don't you and Effie Klinker just fuck off and leave me alone? - You ass-wipe!
you play jump rope with Louisiana law and I'm going to stick your big city smarts right up your New York ass.
this Krusemark was into black magic and all that shit.
nothing is worse for a cop than people who get killed for nutso reasons.
sorry about the mess. Maybe your nigger can clean it up.
what are you singing?
it's by Johnny Favorite. My mother used to sing it all the time.
you okay?
shit!
what do you want, Mr. Angel?
I thought you knew. - Why should l?
two of your morons with a matching poodle have been chasing me for days.
I'm looking for Johnny Favorite.
as far as I know, that dance band scumbag is dead.
that dance band scumbag probably killed your daughter.
who is employing you? - I can't say.
I'll pay. - So do they.
12 years ago, you and your daughter snatched Favorite from the nut hatch.
you gave a junkie doctor 25 grand to pretend Johnny was still there.
you did a good job until a week ago.
you used the name Edward Kelley.
let's go over here. It's a little private and you can sample our Gumbo.
I've got an acid stomach. Cajun cooking kills me.
pity about your stomach! You'd have enjoyed our Gumbo.
I was Edward Kelley. It was me who paid Fowler the 25 grand.
did Favorite know you? - No.
he acted like a sleep walker. He looked out of the window at the lights.
where were you taking him? - Times Square. New Years Eve, '43.
we dropped him off in the crowd, and he disappeared forever.
or so we thought.
you're telling me you paid 25 grand for a guy and lost him in a crowd?
I did it for my daughter.
some sort of hocus-pocus she and Johnny were fooling with. She was obsessed.
I know, I found a mummified hand in her room.
the hand of glory. It's supposed to open any lock.
it was the right hand of a murderer, cut off while his neck was in the noose.
that's what Margaret believed.
black magic! - Black, white, what's the difference? Margaret was always . . .
evil. - Evil as a dunghill.
everyone speaks about someone else. Margaret wasn't evil.
she was a strange kid! She was into Tarot cards before she could read.
who got her started? - Some maid, or governess, who knows.
everything you tell me is a crock of shit!
you got her started!
you're a devil worshipper! - The Prince of Darkness protects the powerful.
shit! - I can't help if you don't believe it.
come straight with me, you slime-bag, or I'll save the state an execution!
I introduced Johnny Favorite to my daughter.
I watched him conjure up Lucifer in my home. He was deeper in it than me.
he made a pact with Satan. He sold his soul.
you expect me to swallow that? - I don't give a damn!
that's a crock of shit, you lying toad!
he sold his soul for stardom. - For stardom?
Satan rose from the depths.
but he tried to outwit the Prince of Darkness.
when he made it big, he tried to duck out of it.
that's a crock of shit!
Johnny found an obscure rite in an ancient manuscript. He needed a victim.
someone his own age. - Why? - To steal their soul.
Toots and Johnny picked up a young soldier.
who? - Just a soldier celebrating New Year's Eve in New York.
they took him back to Johnny's hotel, where they had the ceremony.
what ceremony?
the boy was bound naked on a rubber mat, there were complicated incantations.
a pentacle was branded on his chest.
Margaret gave Johnny a virgin dagger.
he sliced the boy clean open and ate his heart.
it was still beating when he wolfed it down.
Johnny wanted to become that soldier.
before he had worked it out, he was drafted, injured and sent home without even knowing who he was.
who was the boy?
only Johnny knew. He put the dog tags in a vase and gave it to Margaret.
it was Margaret's plan to drop him off in Times Square.
the last place he remembered before it happened.
he needed a victim. Someone his own age.
to steal their soul.
he sliced the boy clean open and he ate his heart.
who was the boy?
Johnny wanted to be the soldier.
maybe he gained the guy's soul, but he still looked like Johnny to me.
I know who I am!
alas . . .
how terrible is wisdom if it brings no profit to the wise, Johnny.
even your name is a dime store joke.
Mephistopheles" is such a mouthful in Manhattan, Johnny.
do you think posing as the devil, just because it scared a superstitious old guitar player, and that witch, and that nutty old man, do you think it's going to scare me? It ain't, because I know who I am.
you killed them, and you're trying to pin it on me.
I know who I am.
if I had cloven hooves and a tail, would you be more convinced?
you're crazy.
I know who I am. You're trying to frame me.
you're trying to frame me.
I know who I am. You murdered them people! I never killed nobody!
I didn't kill Fowler,
I didn't kill Toots, and I didn't kill Margaret or Krusemark.
I killed no one.
I'm afraid you did, Johnny. - My name's not Johnny!
all killed by your own hand. Guided by me, naturally.
you were doomed from the moment you slit that young boy in half.
you've been living on borrowed time and another man's memories for 1 2 years.
I want to tell Winesap, he knows! - He's dead.
nasty accident!
don't worry, no one will mourn one less lawyer. Death's everywhere these days.
but what gives human life its worth, anyway?
because someone loves it, hates it.
the flesh is weak. Only the soul is immortal.
and yours belongs to me!
I know who I am.
that's it Johnny, take a good look!
however cleverly you sneak up on the mirror, your reflection always looks you straight in the eye. - I know who I am.
I know who I am!
why did you come back?
I live here.
who is she?
she ain't: Angel, Harold.
she's my daughter.
bullshit! Who is she?
she stayed here for a little while.
long enough for you to kill her? Or ain't that your gun up her snatch?
you're going to burn for this.
I know.
in hell!
is there a romantic interest I'm not aware of?
Kyle? - Only Kyle. - Kyle?
I've see one of these symbols before.
Kyle has a ring with this on it.
he got it from his birth father.
Adam Baylin? - Adam something. - Adam Baylin?
if Andi can't stay here, then she has to move to Cleveland.
I know that's gonna be hard for you to deal with.
everyone at Latnok seems genuine.
but I'm still not convinced about Cassidy.
seen anyone around my office?
I caught Jessi there this morning.
Jessi? Jessi? I'm well aware of Jessi's gifts, but I also know she's volatile and unpredictable.
her mother's no friend of Latnok.
what do you know about Sarah?
I found something in Cassidy's office.
he has Sarah's ring. - How?
something to do with her disappearance.
recall your experiences from that night and examine your memories.
it's working.
I see something.
he killed her!
she's dead!
my mother is dead.
we need to find out why he did it.
we will.
Hi, Jessi. I didn't know you were here.
what's wrong?
I... - It's OK.
what happened?
I heard you thrashing around.
it was just a bad dream.
it was terrible.
I was at Latnok and... I don't really remember.
well, it's over now. Are you OK?
thank you for checking on me.
it's late.
we should get back to sleep.
OK. Good night.
good night.
listen, Josh, I know you're upset about Andi leaving.
I've been walking around with a pit in my stomach.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
every time I think about her being gone...
but she's not yet.
don't waste your last few days together moping around.
what am I supposed to do?
give her a big send-off.
what are her favorite things?
g-force.
but just playing that for three days straight would be, well, what we always do.
she's into the Cowkeys, but they're out on tour.
and Star Trek.
star Trek? Popular science-fiction entertainment, encompassing six television series and several feature films.
well, thank you, Mr. Wikipedia.
have you seen any of them? - No.
we'll take you when the new movie comes out.
you'll like Spock. He's half-Vulcan, half-human.
Vulcan?
alien race.
so he's different than everyone else.
he struggles to understand human emotion.
sees the world from a unique perspective.
sounds interesting.
Ah, our man from the pod can relate.
except Spock's got really big ears.
which I have out in the garage.
you own Spock ears?
want to dig 'em up?
impress Andi? Come on.
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.
that's not easy to do.
is something wrong?
well...I need to talk to you about something.
I saw you the other night.
kissing Jessi.
I'm sorry.
no, you don't need to apologize.
the two of you have shared so much. You have a unique bond.
it's not that surprising that you'd be attracted to each other.
it is, to me.
I mean, Jessi's always been really important to me, but... these new feelings...
I just don't how to deal with them.
feelings are confusing for ordinary teenagers living in separate houses.
it's so much more complicated for the two of you.
so, what do we do?
you may not like it, but you and Jessi live here together, as part of our family.
and for you to pursue that kind of relationship, well, it's just not appropriate.
I'm sorry, Kyle. I haven't set this kind of boundary with you before.
it won't happen again.
thank you.
I don't want either of you to be hurt.
and you know how fragile Jessi is.
Hey. I just signed for this.
what is it?
the label not clear enough for you?
I've got a new project for you.
Oh, yeah?
I want you to team up with Kyle.
Seriously?
Yeah. It's the formula for a growth accelerant.
we've been trying to crack it for months.
the two of you can make some headway.
I don't want to work with him.
ask Jessi.
no, that ain't gonna happen.
I need someone I can trust.
besides, play nicely with Kyle, and you might make progress with that chick you're seeing.
I'll e-mail you the assignment.
police are searching for any clues that may shed light on the murder of a hunter found in the woods near Victor Falls almost a month ago.
the victim's throat was crushed.
so far, police have no motive for the killing and no suspects have been named.
come on, people, move it along.
I thought you were open for business.
that's right. My business.
we were just... - Tell you what.
sibling benefit.
ten minutes. Start slurping.
this may be one of the few places we can be alone together.
Jessi? - Jessi? - What?
did you listen in on me and Nicole this morning?
Yes, and I don't think it's any of her business.
we live in her house.
we're part of her family.
so kissing me meant nothing to you?
of course it meant something to me.
then how could you not want to be together?
Kyle when you kissed me, I felt such a rush through my entire body.
didn't you feel it?
is it me, or are you getting a vibe?
trying not to. But they're definitely sitting at least two inches closer than they used to.
you don't think they're...?
I don't wanna talk about it.
can we talk about something else?
Absolutely.
so how goes things with you and Nate?
good. - That's great.
you don't like him.
I don't really know him.
how well do you?
it's still really new.
I guess he doesn't talk about himself too much.
I don't want to dump on what could be a really good thing for you.
I just want you to be careful.
make sure you can trust this guy, that's all.
Amanda. Hey. - Nate, hi.
how's it going? - Good.
Kyle? - Good. Is Kyle around? - Kyle?
he's back there. Why?
I just want to partner up on a project with him.
that's really nice.
well, uh, see you later? - Yeah.
am I interrupting anything?
no.
so Cassidy's got something for us to work on together. You up for it?
you and me?
why didn't Cassidy ask me to work with Kyle?
I don't know. He doesn't like you.
well?
fine. - Good.
you'll have another chance to impress me.
we can't be together at Latnok either.
we can't let Cassidy know we suspect anything.
we can't cause any trouble.
if he wants me and Nate to work together, we have to go along with it.
time's up. Get out.
Hey. You're home early. Where's Kyle?
at Latnok, without me. - Oh.
I'm not as fragile as you think.
Jessi... - Jessi... - You don't understand how much Kyle means to me.
I know how close you feel to him.
no. Nobody cares about me like he does.
no one makes me feel as happy or as safe.
I need that. I need him.
Jessi, Kyle can still be there for you.
but while you're both living in this house, he can't be with you, not in that way.
I need to know why you have a problem with Jessi.
she, uh...She was poking around in here the other day.
I think she may have broken into my safe.
why would she do that?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I don't know anything about it.
well, did you know that after your mother's car accident, Jessi said to me that if I ever harmed you or your family, she'd kill me.
she was just being protective.
she could never do anything like that.
Really?
Jessi's a good person.
she's lucky to have a friend like you.
I'm just not sure you know who you're really dealing with.
is that all?
Yeah.
you scared me.
I owe you a few.
what are you doing?
reading you.
what?
I know the look when a girl has a boy on her mind.
what?
you tell me. You can't keep those kinds of secrets in this house.
Kyle kissed me.
wait a second, clarify. Did he actually kiss you?
or did you throw yourself at him? - He kissed me.
there was no throwing involved.
why does everyone think that's so wrong?
because it's Kyle, of the pure and beautiful soul.
we only want what's best for him.
which means not me.
no. - Get out.
get out!
God, I hate myself sometimes.
why do I say cruel things to people?
uh, to Declan, Hillary or Jessi?
Jessi was the lucky recipient.
but I couldn't help it.
am I supposed to ignore that the two of you were huddled up at The Rack?
huddled up? - We were just talking.
Lori - Sharing secrets. - Lori.
what kind of secrets?
have anything to do with Latnok?
Yes. Most of the students there have been great.
it's Cassidy I need to know more about.
so I have to make him believe I'm on his side.
you need an olive branch.
an overture.
ask him out to dinner.
invite him here.
if you want him to believe he's winning you over, a dinner invitation from your parents...
I'd like to meet this guy anyway.
no, I don't want him in this house.
Kyle, you're not doing this unless we're part of it.
you and Josh shouldn't be here. - But I want to be.
you make Cassidy too uncomfortable.
why is everybody shutting me out?
I haven't done anything wrong.
Jessi... - Jessi... - You don't want me around either.
you know that's not true.
know what? I won't bother any of you anymore.
you'd better leave the door open.
you know, what we're doing with Cassidy is all about you.
I'm trying to figure out why Sarah was killed, and I need him to trust me.
so if he wants to drive a wedge between us, we have to let him.
I just hate how everyone's looking at me like I'm this horrible person.
nobody in the family does.
and you shouldn't care what Cassidy thinks about you.
fine. Have your dinner. I'll stay away.
Jessi, I need to know that you're committed to this.
I have to trust that you can keep things under control.
don't you know me well enough to be sure?
I just don't want any surprises.
Lori, I need you to help me with something.
but you'll have to keep it a secret.
espionage? All over it.
so what's my mission?
I need to know more about Cassidy.
I think we should adjust the floor value here.
too many ideal elements.
the algorithm lost stability about three adjustments ago.
you're right.
easy to miss.
apparently, not for you.
Cassidy teamed us up. He must think you can contribute.
Cassidy just wants us to get along.
I know he supervises everything, but have you ever seen him report to anybody?
why do you ask?
curious.
well, I have no idea who he answers to.
all those senior Latnok guys, they're all cloak and dagger, minus the dagger.
right.
so, what do we got?
maybe if we adjust the values in this sequence here...
that's it.
Cassidy's had people working on this for months and you solved it.
just like that.
we solved it.
I guess we're done.
I wanted to thank you.
for what?
for making an effort with Nate.
it means a lot to me.
I just want you to be happy, Amanda.
I want the same for you.
so, what's this big surprise? G- Force marathon?
give me more credit than that.
well, show me already.
not yet. Still gotta kick out a couple of paying customers so I can reap benefits that come with minimum wage authority.
Ooh, it turns me on when you go crazy with power.
just give me a minute.
whatever it is, he hasn't stopped working on it.
Yeah, he's such a cute worker bee when he puts his mind to something.
all right, guys, time's up.
makes me sad to think his ambition might stop when I leave.
I don't know about that.
he's already offered to take half of my shifts next week.
I think he wants to stay busy so he doesn't miss you as much.
I'm sorry, did I say something?
no, it's fine. It's just...
my moms changed our plans.
we're not leaving in three days.
we're leaving in the morning.
and Josh doesn't know?
this is our last night together.
Mrs. Trager, I presume.
Mr. Cassidy. - It's Michael, please.
these are for you.
Oh. They're beautiful.
please, come in.
thank you.
pleasure, sir.
Kyle, how you doing, man?
Hey, dude. - Hello.
it smells, uh, ridiculously delicious in here.
don't let that fool you.
can I get you a drink?
I'd love one. Thank you.
you know what it is?
give a girl a minute.
the lights, like little stars, shiny surfaces.
it feels very... futuristic.
an interesting observation, Miss Jensen.
Oh, my God.
I love Star Trek.
I wanted to give you something really special.
you did.
so you know what to do?
the mission is clear.
you love this, don't you?
nothing like a little intrigue and reconnaissance to light up the night.
here they come. Hey!
sorry. Too much?
Yeah, a little. A tad. Just, uh, act natural.
Hey, we just bumped into each other.
so did we.
I mean, we were both here waiting for you, separately.
and then we decided to sit at this table. Here at The Rack.
and we're all here now, so you guys want to hang out for a few?
um, OK.
great. - Fantastic.
Hi.
this is wonderful.
thank you.
I haven't had a good home-cooked meal in I don't even know how long.
where is home, Mr. Cassidy?
Brooklyn.
OK.
uh, England. East London.
little town called Hackney.
still have family there?
we've scattered.
but I love Seattle. And my work keeps me busy, so...
Kyle tells us you're not a scientist.
no. I'm definitely missing that gene.
so, what exactly is your contribution at Latnok?
I foster.
I encourage. Basically, I'm a professional nag.
Kyle can attest to my persistence.
Yes, I can.
I think we'd all like to hear what's expected of Kyle.
Jessi, what are you doing here?
I live here.
I thought you had plans to be out tonight.
I changed my mind.
well, we were just having dinner.
great. Is there a place for me?
of course there is.
I'll get you a plate.
it must be exciting to have two minds like Kyle's and Jessi's mix.
Oh, thrilling! Thrilling.
Kyle's a natural-born leader.
and Jessi shows great potential.
this brownie is amazing.
so good you want to save some for later.
my cobbler's pretty great.
want some?
Trager doesn't eat cooked fruit.
so, what are you guys doing later?
whatever it is, we can't go back to my house.
I've been banished.
your boss, Cassidy, is over for dinner with Kyle and my parents.
he's not our boss.
I thought he called the shots.
Oh, I get it. What happens at Latnok, stays at Latnok.
that's right, top secret.
no, we like to keep the details confidential, but... I think I can trust you.
Cassidy's in charge, but we have tons of freedom.
he knows when to help and when to get out of our way.
so you like working with him?
he's fine.
Yeah, whatever. He's, um...
you know, we should get going if we're gonna catch a movie. - No!
I mean, I wanna try your cobbler.
you used to dream about Mr. Spock?
Oh, in my mind, we were dating.
I was only 12, remember?
it was innocent.
we'd do things like eat cotton candy and play foosball at the International Space Station.
three days before you leave, and you pull out this great goofy stuff.
thank you.
for what?
I just don't think I've said it enough.
you've been so great.
I haven't been the typical first girlfriend and you've always been there for me.
through everything.
and I have to tell you...
whoa. Stop.
no heartfelt goodbyes.
we still have plenty of time for that.
Yeah, but... - No buts.
tonight is about you and me in our own private universe.
you want to go where no man has gone before?
or just once before?
how long have you been waiting to say that?
all night long.
Michael, you know, Kyle and Jessi share very unusual backgrounds.
two peas in a pod, so to speak.
we've tried to keep their lives very private.
my biggest concern is that they always stay protected.
Absolutely.
look, my apologies for Latnok's regrettable actions on prom night.
regrettable is putting it mildly.
fair enough.
but let me assure you, from this point forward,
Kyle and Jessi's well being is always at the forefront.
you know what I'd like to hear about?
my mother.
what? He must know Sarah.
certainly I've heard of her.
brilliant woman.
Oh, so you've never met?
never had the pleasure.
really.
Jessi, you know she's been in hiding for years.
she wants nothing to do with Latnok.
that's right.
she didn't trust you.
she never met me.
it's Latnok she had... has a problem with.
Nate and I finished that project for you.
so soon? Great. You must be working well together.
he was very helpful.
what was the project about?
we don't know anything about this guy and he's here having dinner.
Jessi. - Jessi. - He doesn't trust me?
I don't trust him.
Jessi, please.
he's done terrible things.
what are you talking about?
you're a liar!
you have secrets.
maybe we should tell this family about the secret you've been keeping from them.
I think it's beholden upon me to tell you what sort of person you have living under your roof.
you remember that first night, Jessi.
after the explosion, you found your way out of the pod and left Zzyzx.
you took a little wander in the woods.
you came across a man camping.
no.
a stranger to you.
please stop.
and you killed him.
an hour out of the pod, and she murdered someone.
I'm afraid that's the sort of person that she is.
it's in her nature.
Jessi, what is he saying?
I have the news reports.
the murder's still unsolved. - I didn't murder him.
he had a knife. - Then it's true?
no. I was alone. I was scared.
he tried to attack me.
Oh, my God. - I'm not a killer!
I'm not a killer.
wait!
I'm terribly sorry.
I hate to drop news like that on you.
I just can't believe it.
it's a lot to take in.
but I do feel I had to tell you.
we've been concerned about Jessi for quite some time.
knowing that she's here with your family now...
I don't think any of us want someone so...
...Unpredictable getting closer to Kyle.
are you OK?
she was so upset.
I just hope she's all right.
this is why he's extraordinary.
he's only concerned about her.
so is it off-limits, or can you tell us what you're working on at Latnok now?
unbelievable.
what's with this super perky friendly routine?
I'm showing interest. I'm being nice.
that's so not like you.
it's sweet that you're trying to connect with me as Declan's ex-girlfriend.
see? I'm sweet.
I'm trying to connect.
and in answer to your question, I've got a bunch of new ideas, too soon to discuss.
you have to run them by Cassidy?
why all this interest in Cassidy?
I just want to get a sense of your life.
Oh. - I don't like him.
he didn't want me to date you at first, and he didn't exactly threaten me, but we got pretty close to Don Corleone territory.
the guy creeps me out. - How weird.
Kyle, I know tonight didn't work out the way we'd hoped.
we all want the best for Jessi.
but clearly, she's a very troubled girl.
and you've spent an excessive amount of time being her anchor.
that has got to be draing.
she's my friend.
I'd do anything for her.
you're a good man.
I just don't want her instability jeopardize your future.
we never had a chance to talk about that... - I'd still like to.
maybe we can meet later.
that would be wonderful.
the Rack?
half an hour?
sounds like a plan.
OK, the coast is clear.
I always pictured the fairy-tale ending to the perfect date as me climbing through your sister's window.
I wish I could beam you up to maintain the theme of our evening.
anyway, let's move.
Yes, sir.
he's coming.
dad!
Hey. How's it going? - Hey.
is Star Trek night over already?
what happened? Did you get mopey again?
no, it was great. You were right.
Andi loved the whole super-galactic send-off. Genius idea.
then why...?
let me explain.
Josh, I can't believe you look so tired.
I'll go tell your mother that you're home and that you're going straight to bed.
to sleep.
so this is it.
my domain.
Wow. You must study a lot.
there's always someone studying more.
why do you make everything a competion?
Wow. Direct.
sorry.
no, I think I need that.
you should call me on my stuff. It's good.
can I get you anything?
I could use a soda.
machine's right downstairs.
no Belly Button
your beverage, milady.
thank you.
you OK?
fine.
Hello?
is anyone here?
Jessi. Where is everyone?
we closed early.
I don't know what it is you want.
the truth.
I know you killed Sarah.
Why?
Sarah left.
I'm sorry she couldn't handle being your mother.
don't you dare speak of her that way.
she didn't leave me, you killed her.
you need help.
actually, I think you do.
see what's happening to the water?
I can do that to you.
I can manipulate the blood flow in your body.
what? - I can target certain areas and make the vessels expand and contract.
Jessi, listen... - Why did she have to die?
I suggest that you answer me.
you don't want to accept that Sarah left.
I had nothing to do with it!
what are you doing?
stop! Don't!
you need to calm down.
he murdered my mother!
stay out of it.
it didn't happen that way.
what are you saying?
you want the truth?
Sarah attacked me.
what? - She saw me that night!
she knew I was Latnok.
she was gonna kill me.
she lost it!
I was protecting myself. I had no choice.
you're lying.
I can tell that you're lying.
it makes no sense.
Jessi! You need to tell her what's going on.
Baylin's experiment.
prolonged gestation in a pod.
we're starting it up again.
the experiment.
why would you do that?
I'm looking at the reason.
you're a success.
Sarah found out.
she didn't approve.
so you killed her!
you took everything from me!
my mother! And now Kyle!
Jessi! Jessi, don't!
you know what I did. You can't even look at me anymore.
that's not true.
we can get through this.
no. It doesn't matter anymore.
I'm already a murder. - No!
Jessi. Speak to me.
Kyle, she's... - No, don't say it!
please. It didn't work.
Jessi, please! Breathe!
Kyle, I got nothing, man.
I got nothing.
come on, we gotta get out of here.
Oh, my God.
we gotta get out of here. - I won't leave her.
Kyle, you can't be here.
you can't be here, man.
Jessi, I'm sorry.
they're gone.
are you all right?
I slowed my heartbeat down to two beats per minute.
and it was strangely relaxing.
you better go.
Nicole's waiting for you at home.
do you think we convinced Cassidy?
he'll send people to clean up the mess.
won't they tell him they didn't find my body?
don't worry. I'll take care of it.
I'm so happy you're home.
are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine.
Kyle explained the trick you were pulling on Cassidy.
I wish I'd known about it from the beginning.
we didn't want to worry you.
that part of your plan was unsuccessful.
Nicole, I'm really sorry I didn't tell you about what happened to me that night.
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
and the way I reacted...
Jessi, you know you can always count on me.
I was just so surprised, hearing it like that.
that's why I decided to tell Kyle before.
when we were planning all this, he said,"No surprises."
and that was the one secret I never shared.
so I told him.
and he understood.
he always does.
so how did it go at The Rack?
just like we wanted.
I don't like that Kyle's still out there with Cassidy.
Kyle can handle him.
we had fooled Cassidy, and he revealed my biggest challenge:
Latnok was re-starting Adam's experiment.
I had to stop them.
I had to keep up the charade.
it was an accident.
you know that? - That doesn't change what happened.
she was gonna kill me.
you saved my life.
Kyle, I promise I will take care of this.
I will take care of you.
but you need to pull it together and go home.
tell them you met with me, but you never saw Jessi.
look at me. Look at me.
I'll make sure there is no trace of what happened.
this never happened.
as far as anyone's concerned, Jessi ran away and she's not coming back.
do you understand?
Yes.
we're in this together now, Kyle.
and together, there is nothing that we can't do.
but we need to trust each other.
I trust you.
do you trust me?
I hadn't had much experience lying.
do you trust me?
but when it was necessary...
I do.
...it turned out I was good at it.
but you realize I know nothing about politics?
you voted for him, didn't you? - Adam Lang? Of course I did.
everyone voted for him. He wasn't a politician, he was a craze.
well, there you go.
look, it's a new ghostwriter he needs, not another goddamn politico.
he was paid $10 million for these memoirs, but rumor has it the manuscript's a crock of shit.
Rhinehart's lending him his house at the ocean so they can fix it, and the pressure must have gotten to McAra.
pathologist said his blood was, like, three parts booze.
you mean he drowned by accident?
accident, suicide, who cares? It was the book that killed him.
well, that's encouraging.
who is this McAra? Should I have heard of him?
Yeah. He was some kind of aide to Lang when he was Prime Minister, so don't admit that you haven't. He was with him for years.
I don't know, Rick.
this is a great opportunity for you.
plus the money is good. Kids won't starve.
I don't have any kids. - I do.
Roy.
who're you expecting to bomb you, Random House?
we're publishing Lang's memoirs.
that's enough to make us a target, apparently.
thank you.
how many have you seen? - Five. You're the last.
I must be honest.
I don't think you're the right man for this assignment.
then it's a good job it's not your decision, Roy.
John Maddox, chief executive of Rhinehart, New York.
sir.
Sidney Kroll, Mr. Lang's Washington attorney.
Mr. Kroll.
and Nick Ricardelli I believe you know.
all right, Rick.
all right, I gather from Rick you're aware of the situation?
perhaps you can enlighten us and tell us what exactly you're gonna bring to this project.
nothing.
no, I'm not gonna pretend to be someone I'm not.
you have my CV.
his last effort was the autobiography of a magician,
I Came, I Sawed, I Conquered.
Yeah, and it went straight to number one, so...
after you turned it down, Roy.
look, I don't read political memoirs. Who does?
and I gather you've spent $10 million on this book.
how much of that are you gonna see back?
two? Three?
it's bad news for your shareholders.
and it's worse news for your client, Mr. Kroll.
Adam Lang, he wants a place in history, not in the remainder tables.
Oh, please!
it's because I know nothing about politics that I'll ask the questions that get right to the heart of who Adam Lang is.
and that is what sells autobiographies.
heart.
Wow! That's nicely done.
what utter balls. - You think so?
John, of course. Adam Lang's a world historical figure.
his autobiography is gonna be a world-publishing event.
Yeah, well, I got warehouses filled with world-publishing events waiting to be pulped.
Sid?
Adam is obviously still very upset by what happened to Mike McAra.
he was irreplaceable. Irreplaceable, and yet he has to be replaced.
Adam can certainly appreciate the benefits of trying someone different.
in the end, it's about chemistry. Do you work out, maybe?
not really. - That's a pity. Adam likes to work out.
actually, I know a good writer on the Guardian who uses a gym.
okay, maybe we could just run over the publishing schedule, yeah?
we need to wrap this up in a month.
a month? - Yes.
you want the book in a month? - We already have a first draft.
Yeah, well, it needs a lot of work.
that's why I like your resume here. You're fast, and you deliver.
you name it, he ghosts it.
and you're a Brit.
the ghost should be a Brit.
to get the jolly old tone right, right?
do you have any family commitments? - No, I have no family. Why?
Adam is locked into a US lecture tour, also a fundraising program for the Adam Lang Foundation.
it's a month in the States. That's okay.
couldn't I bring the manuscript back here to work on?
I'm afraid not. It's in a secure environment in Marty Rhinehart's own house.
only a few people are allowed to handle it.
sounds more like a bomb than a book.
I will need to see it myself at some point. I am supposed to be editing it.
Yeah, in theory. Actually, we need to talk about that.
how soon can you get over there? - As soon as you want.
he'll fly tonight. - Rick.
it's okay.
okay, you're in.
Oh!
Congratulations. - Thank you. Thanks.
Rick. - Thank you.
actually, I have something here - you might want to look at. - Is that... is that...
no, no, no, this isn't Adam's book. No, it's another client of mine.
Yeah, perhaps you can let me know what you think.
sure.
okay, if you're gonna get that evening flight, we'd better talk contracts with Rick here.
wanna show our friend to the door? Would you?
Roy?
call you in an hour, buddy.
Hey!
remember...
heart.
there's something not quite right about this project.
what? Me, you mean? - Obviously you.
and McAra. Suicide?
he didn't strike me as the suicidal type.
always nice to see you, Roy.
good luck.
Oh, God.
thank you.
yeah? - Congratulations!
on what? - On having me as your agent.
Yeah, I can hardly believe my luck.
are you packed?
I just got mugged.
shit! Are you okay?
Yeah, all they took was the manuscript that Sidney Kroll gave me.
what? Why?
I don't know. You tell me.
are you hurt?
no, I'm fine. I think they must have followed me from Rhinehart's.
why would they do that?
well, maybe they thought I had Lang's book.
I knew this whole thing was a bad idea.
you're still okay to fly tonight, right?
for God's sake, Rick, I'm in shock.
well, here's another shock for you.
for one month's work on a manuscript that's already written,
Rhinehart Inc. is willing to pay you $250, 000, plus expenses.
window seat or aisle?
islam has issued a statement claiming responsibility.
we hope to bring you more on that later in the bulletin.
meanwhile, former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is back in the news tonight.
according to leaked documents, Mr. Lang authorized the illegal use of British special forces to seize four suspected al-Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan and then hand them over for interrogation by the CIA.
the men, Nasir Ashraf, Marwat Sayed, Salim Khan and Faruk Ahmed, all British citizens, were seized in the Pakistani city of Peshawar five years ago.
all four were allegedly transferred out of the country to a secret location and tortured.
Mr. Ashraf is reported to have died under interrogation.
such an operation would have been illegal under...
yeah? - Where are you?
heathrow, like you. Waiting for my flight to New York.
can you see the news?
the Lang story? Yeah, I'm watching it now.
what have you gotten me into?
I got you into a quarter of a million bucks, pal, that's what I got you into.
they're calling my flight. I gotta go.
listen, I just realized
Sidney Kroll could have given me that manuscript deliberately so it would look like I was carrying Lang's book.
why the hell would he do that?
I don't know. To use me as a tethered goat?
get some sleep on the plane. You're sounding weird.
a tethered goat. I'll call you next week.
... and long-term psychological trauma.
in other words, torture.
Hello, sir. Would you like a newspaper to read?
have you got the Evening Standard? - We do, yes.
Thanks. Thank you.
Hello, madam. Would you like a newspaper to read?
Yes, please. Thank you.
passport?
this is an absolute scandal!
Amelia Bly. Welcome.
I'm Adam's assistant.
Adam's in New York, unfortunately, and won't be back until later this afternoon.
actually, forget I said that, it's bloody ridiculous!
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry. I'm afraid Ruth's having one of those days.
if this isn't a good time, I could go to...
no, no. She's keen to meet you.
right. Shall we make a start? - Right.
how was your journey? - Long.
we're a small team. Thanks.
this is Alice.
Lucy's traveling with Adam.
we need another pair of hands, but Adam couldn't bring himself to replace Mike.
they were together so long. - How long were you with him?
eight years. I'm an attachment from Number 10.
Ah. Poor Number 10.
before I show you the manuscript,
I need you to sign this confidentiality agreement.
sign here.
and here.
and here.
wow, quite a place.
don't you get lonely at night?
it's my husband I miss the most.
are you married? I noticed you don't wear a wedding ring.
I can't, sadly. It's far too large.
it bleeps when I go through airport security. - Oh.
here we are.
the manuscript is not to be removed from this room. It's not to be copied.
you have six hours before Adam gets in from New York.
can you finish by then? - I'll try.
I'll ask Dep to bring you up a sandwich for lunch.
Thanks.
have fun.
Langs are Scottish folk, originally, and proud of it.
our name is a derivation of 'long', the old English word for 'tall', and it is from north of the border that my forefathers hail.
fuck.
my great-grandfather, Ebenezer Lang, "was born in 1862 in Pitlochry, Scotland.
one of nine children, seven of them boys.
the American President was much taller than I had expected.
this year's European summit was particularly interesting.
I always found the Queen, in private, to have a delightful sense of humor.
Thanks.
I've always been an optimist. The present is where we live.
ruth and I look forward to the future, whatever it may hold.
as bad as that?
Oh, hello.
well? How bad is it?
you haven't read it?
not all of it.
well, let's just say it needs some work. - How much work?
well, all the words are there. They're just in the wrong order.
come on. You look like you need a break.
you were my idea.
I was?
you wrote Christy Costello's memoirs, didn't you?
you read those?
we stayed at his house in Mustique, last winter.
the book was beside the bed.
I'm embarrassed. - No, why?
it was brilliant, in a horrible sort of way.
how you turned his ramblings into something vaguely coherent.
I said to Adam, "Here's the guy to write your book, not Mike."
God, I miss home.
it's like being married to Napoleon on St. Helena.
why don't you go back to London? - I don't feel I can leave him alone.
there's something not quite right with him at the moment.
Amelia told me he was very upset at the death of Michael McAra.
Oh, she did, did she?
quite when Mrs. Bly became the expert on my husband's emotions, I'm not sure.
losing Mike was a blow, of course, but it's not just that.
it's having to relive everything, year by year, for this bloody book.
Oh, dear.
you must be wondering what you've let yourself in for.
fine, fine. I'll tell him.
they're just about to land.
on Thursday, he's in Chicago.
actually, I think I'll go and meet him.
Amelia can stay here and polish her nails or something.
why don't you come, say hello?
fine. I'll travel in the backup car. I can do my nails in there.
Hi, darling.
how was New York? - Short and sweet.
Hi, Barry. Hi, Amelia.
hello. Who are you?
I'm your ghost.
right.
don't worry. He isn't always such a jerk.
this place really comes alive at night.
you'll be with us for four weeks, is that right?
I'm afraid so.
and the bill goes directly to the Rhinehart Corporation?
good.
that doesn't include the mini-bar.
all right. He's ready for you.
how's your hotel? Quiet?
monastic.
that's nice. No distractions.
Thanks, love.
Hi, man. You ready to start?
Absolutely.
is the manuscript loaded on this? - It is.
can I have it?
I'm sorry, that would be a security risk.
you mean I've got to retype the whole manuscript?
have you really got my entire book on that little thing?
we can get 100 books on it, Adam.
and it can be copied in a flash. That's the trouble.
amazing.
you know the worst thing about my life? You get so out of touch.
everything's done for you. You don't drive, you don't carry money.
if I need cash, I have to borrow it from the protection boys.
this is the kind of details we need in the memoirs.
I couldn't put that in. People would think I was a complete idiot.
no, not at all. No, this shows what it's like being Prime Minister.
that's exactly what the readers want to know.
how does it feel to run a country? How does it feel to be so cut off?
how does it feel to be so hated?
thanks a lot.
and so loved.
Amelia, what do you think?
I think I should leave you two alone.
so, how do we go about this?
I interview you.
I turn your answers into prose.
here and there, I'll add linking passages, imitating your voice.
okay.
you heard about Mike? - Yes. I'm sorry.
we should put in something nice about him.
I think his mother would like that.
of course.
well, um, the first thing that struck me was, you became such a successful politician precisely because you didn't appear to be a politician.
it's certainly not something I wanted to do when I was younger.
I thought most student politicians were complete nerds.
well, I'm with you there. So, what turned you on to politics?
turned me on, indeed.
let's see, I was 23, something like that, a couple of years out of Cambridge.
and I remember it was a Sunday afternoon, it was raining.
I was still in bed. And someone starts knocking at the door.
and, you know, I'd been out the night before and had a few drinks and what have you.
so, I get the pillow and I put it over my head, and it starts up again.
knock, knock, knock, knock!
and I get up, I'm swearing, I go to the door and there's this girl.
she's soaking wet, but she just launches into this speech about the local elections.
and that's it.
I'm in love. - And this is Ruth?
this is Ruth.
and the only way I can see her again is to join the party and hand out leaflets.
this is great.
you want to use this?
use it? I think we should open the whole book like this.
I went into politics out of love, "not love for a party or an ideology, but out of love for a woman."
could you transcribe this as quickly as possible, please?
of course.
Thanks. - How's it going?
pretty well. He keeps calling me "man."
he always does that when he can't remember someone's name.
there are sandwiches in the kitchen.
Oh, shit.
it's awful.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't realize there was anyone up there.
what on earth is going on?
it's just a security drill, sir. We have it once a week.
so, there you are. I'd rather lost track of you.
I'm a big boy now. Can't keep your eye on me all the time.
don't wander around on your own. The security boys don't like it.
gotcha.
did you win? - Didn't play tennis. Gym.
gym? What's he in training for? The Olympics?
here's your transcript.
Cambridge. Let's talk about that.
sorry? Um...
Cambridge?
it was such a long time ago, I can hardly remember.
you did a lot of acting?
some.
it must have been good training for politics, acting?
it was a good way to meet girls.
let's not put that in, by the way, okay?
still, acting must have been very important to you.
okay, let's say I enjoyed it.
you know, you go on the stage, pretend to be somebody else, and people actually applaud you for it.
good, that's more like it. Let's put that in.
no. - Why not?
because these are the memoirs of a Prime Minister.
and whenever my opponents were stuck with something to hit me with, they always said I was a bloody actor!
do you know what the Times of London said the day I resigned?
kindly leave the "stage."
so, no, we won't dwell, if you don't mind, on my student days as an actor.
we leave it exactly the way Mike wrote it.
would you like to take a break for a minute?
actually, that would be a good idea, thank you. I need to make a call.
what a bastard.
look at this.
former British Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart "has asked the International Criminal Court in The Hague to investigate allegations "that the former British Prime Minister Adam Lang "ordered the illegal handover of terrorist suspects "for torture by the CIA.
don't!
the pack is on the move.
unplug all the phones.
is Ruth still out walking? Shit! She is, isn't she?
Barry! Barry! - Yeah.
would you please find Mrs. Lang and get her back here as soon as you can?
right. - Let's go.
Rycart has made a statement. - Yes, I know.
he just called me. - It's unbelievable.
he wanted very much to let me know it was nothing personal.
he wanted very, very much to tell me that it was only because of his well-known stand on human rights that he couldn't keep quiet any longer.
his well-known stand on human rights. Dear God!
sorry to lose my temper earlier. - Forget it.
and have you told her?
Yes. Just called her. - And how did she take it?
sorry, Adam. This is running on AP.
according to sources in The Hague, "the prosecutor's office of the International Criminal Court "will issue a statement in the morning.
Oh, Adam.
thank you, Alice.
why weren't we given some warning of this? Where's Downing Street?
the phones are disconnected.
switch is probably trying to get through now.
now? What freaking use is now? What are you people doing?
I mean, you're not telling me that the Cabinet Office didn't know this was coming?
the war crimes court doesn't warn a suspect who's under investigation.
that's what Adam is now, a suspect?
you need to call Sid Kroll.
I think we should call London first.
Adam! If it suits them, they will hang you out to dry.
you need a lawyer. Call Sid.
get Sid on the line. - What about the media?
issue a holding statement, something short.
this is when we need Mike.
I'll write something.
let him do it. He's supposed to be the writer.
hang on a minute. - I should sound confident.
not defensive, that'd be fatal. But I shouldn't be cocky.
no bitterness, no anger, and don't say
I'm pleased at this opportunity to clear my name or any balls like that.
so, you're not defensive, but you're not cocky.
you're not angry, but you're not pleased?
that's it. - Then what exactly are you?
told you he was funny.
I've always been a passionate supporter...
no, scrub that.
I've always been a strong, no, committed supporter of the work of the International Criminal Court. Has he?
you're the writer.
the struggle against terror is too important to be used for the purposes of personal revenge.
very good. You could be the new Mike McAra.
Hello? - John Maddox.
this is gonna be big. This can only be good for us.
could be. - Here's the first chapter right here.
okay.
what've you covered so far?
um...
the early years, childhood, university.
all right, forget that crap. Get him focused on the war crimes.
and he can't talk to anybody else, all right?
right. - It's gotta be our exclusive.
any chance of you finishing the manuscript sooner?
sooner?
Yeah, yeah, sooner.
well, how much sooner?
I'm thinking two weeks.
Jesus.
look, I know it's tough, but if anyone can do it, you can.
I'm relying on you. We'll talk.
shit.
I'd never have guessed you smoked.
I only allow myself one at times of great stress or contentment.
and which is this? - Very funny.
Maddox just called. He wants the book in two weeks instead of four.
Christ. Good luck.
Yeah, I wouldn't mind a lift back to my hotel. I could get on with some work there.
you're not planning on taking that manuscript - out of here, are you? - Course not.
because you do realize how serious this is getting, don't you?
you can search me, if you like. - That won't be necessary.
all right. Fetch your stuff. I'll get one of the boys to take you.
Mr. Lang insisted he had always been a committed supporter of the work of the International Criminal Court.
Mr. Lang added, quote, "The struggle against terror is too important "to be used for the purposes of personal revenge."
same again, sir? - This is being widely interpreted as...
Yes, thanks. - ...an attack on the former British Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart, who has asked...
could we change the channel?
sure. - Thanks.
at issue is the practice of so-called waterboarding, an interrogation technique considered a war...
something to eat? - What've you got?
club sandwich. Clam chowder. - Chowder will be fine.
you're English?
and so are you.
indeed I am.
you here on a holiday? - No, I'm working.
so, what's your line?
just this and that. Excuse me.
I hear Adam Lang's on the island.
is he?
so I hear.
you don't happen to know his whereabouts, do you?
no.
no, I'm afraid not. If you don't mind.
Raymond to Naslund and to Mattias Ohlund.
a slap pass to Lukas Krajicek. He's in trouble against
Barret Jackman and the referee...
asshole.
and Ohlund can't hold it in again, and this power play is just about over.
Keith Tkachuk almost set to come back on.
Hello?
can I help you? - Hi.
Yeah, can you tell me, has anyone gone up to my room?
no, sir.
did anyone ask for me? - No.
what about that other guest? The, um...
there's an Englishman.
you're the only guest in the hotel, sir.
Hello? - You need to check out of the hotel immediately.
things have changed. A car is on its way.
what?
see you then.
Hello?
okay. - Just check on that. Okay?
it's getting big, huh? - So I see.
who're you with?
I'm on my own.
Oh, sod it. Here we go again.
you've reached the office of Rick Ricardelli. Leave a message.
Hi, Rick. Now they want the book in two weeks.
thanks for getting me this job.
can't talk. Some peace protestors are trying to kill me.
you're working for a murderer! You're working for a murderer!
liar! Liar! Liar!
are you ill? - No, I'm aging.
this place is Shangri-La in reverse.
I tried to call you several times last night.
you didn't answer.
I forgot to charge my mobile phone.
Really? And the hotel phone?
I'm a heavy sleeper.
well, you can do your heavy sleeping here from now on.
here? - We're under siege.
you can't run the media gauntlet every day.
eventually, they'll discover who you are. And that would be horrid for you.
so, this is where you put the granny.
no.
this is where we put Mike Mcara.
we haven't had a chance to clear it yet. The sheets have been changed, though.
actually, I make it a rule never to stay in a client's house.
but now you can have constant access to the manuscript.
isn't that what you want?
besides, Sid Kroll will be arriving any minute.
why don't you settle in, and then come up and join us?
you're practically one of us now. - I am?
you drafted the statement yesterday. That makes you an accomplice.
so, here's the score. You're not being charged, you're not being arrested.
none of this is gonna amount to a hill of beans.
the only thing the prosecutor is asking for is permission to launch a formal investigation.
investigating me for what? - Connie?
either crimes against humanity or war crimes.
well, that's absurd. It's not exactly genocide.
under Article 25, a person shall be guilty of a war crime "if that person facilitates the commission of such a crime "or aids, abets or otherwise assists in its commission.
that's rather sweeping. - Well, if it's any comfort, you're in no jeopardy as long as you stay here, among friends.
are you saying I can't leave the United States?
as your attorney, I strongly advise you not to travel to any country that recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.
well, just about every country in the world recognizes the ICC.
america doesn't.
who else? - Josh?
iraq, China, North Korea, Indonesia, Israel.
and that's it? - There are some parts of Africa.
wait!
I wish to make a short statement. I won't be taking questions.
this morning, I was granted power to investigate the former British Prime Minister, Mr. Adam Peter Bennett Lang, under Articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
I shall shortly be contacting Mr. Lang and the British government to ask for their full cooperation. Thank you.
Oh, God.
okay, we need to get you to Washington, Adam, right away.
my plane is at the airport.
we can get you in to see the Speaker of the House at lunchtime and have a photo-op with the Secretary of State in the afternoon.
won't it look as if I'm panicking?
no, they'll both say that the meetings were fixed weeks ago.
well, what the hell are we supposed to be discussing?
AIDS? Poverty? Climate change?
who cares? The important thing is to show the world it's business as usual.
what do you think, Ruth? - I think it's a terrible idea.
you'll look as though you're America's whipping boy, running crying home to daddy.
so, what would you do? - Fly to London.
the government will support you.
the British government will cooperate fully with the investigation.
Really? And what makes you think that?
I'm not thinking it, Ruth, I'm reading it.
believe we can now go live to the UN in New York, where the former British Foreign Secretary, Richard Rycart, is about to make a statement.
I watched the announcement in The Hague today with great shock and sadness.
Adam Lang was and is an old friend of mine.
you cheeky bugger!
I regret that he's chosen to bring his down to a personal level.
this isn't personal. This is about justice.
this is about making sure every political leader knows when they make a decision, they will be held to account by international law.
thank you.
if you're called to testify, sir, will you go?
certainly, I'll go. - Of course you will, you little shit!
that settles it. Washington it is.
I still say it'll look bad.
not as bad as being led away from Heathrow in handcuffs.
it would show you had some guts.
well, then why the hell don't you just fly back without me?
if the British government wants to hand me over to this kangaroo court, then sod them!
I'll go where people want me.
Amelia, tell the boys we're leaving. Have one of the girls pack me a bag.
you'd better pack one for yourself.
why don't you share a suitcase? It's so much more convenient.
I'll see you tomorrow. I'm sorry to abandon you.
at least this might help sales.
perhaps Rhinehart's PR department organized the whole thing.
well, tell them to stop it, will you?
okay, people, remember, happy, happy faces.
so, just to summarize what we know so far, it's now official, the special prosecutor of the International War Crimes Court is to launch an investigation...
the special prosecutor announced she was going to investigate Mr. Lang, well, there was a big cheer, I can tell you.
so, let's talk to some of these protestors.
you, sir, you're English, I believe. - I am.
so, what brings you so far from home?
my son. He was killed in one of Mr. Lang's illegal wars.
Lang's never visited the injured. He's never apologized.
I was in the British Army for 30 years. It's a disgrace!
thank you. Can I ask you the same question?
you're a murderer, Lang! You're a war criminal!
liar, liar, liar!
Lang, Lang, Lang!
killer, killer, killer!
Lang, Lang, Lang! Liar, liar, liar!
Lang, Lang, Lang! Killer, killer, killer!
over here, Mr. Lang!
I apologize for keeping you waiting so long in the cold.
what's your reaction to Mr. Rycart's statement?
I'd like to say a few words in response to the news from The Hague.
these are strange times when those who stand for freedom and justice are accused of being criminals, while those who incite hatred and seek to destroy democracy - are treated as victims. - War criminal!
let me make one thing perfectly clear.
while I have breath in my body, I shall fight terrorism...
liar!
whether it's on the battlefield or, if necessary, in the courts.
thank you very much.
have you spoken to the President, Mr. Lang?
Oh, for God's sake.
God.
shit!
one minute!
yes?
sir? You want lunch?
that would be great. Give me five minutes, thanks.
P. Emmett?
richard Rycart.
who is this?
Dep? - Sir?
is there a map of the island that I could borrow?
look. It's rain soon.
I don't know. I think it will be all right.
why don't you take the car? It's for guests. Here's the key.
for our guests, it's very nice car. - Oh. Yes.
Mr. Mcara loved this car very, very much.
do you know... I'm gonna take the... I'm gonna take the bicycle. Thanks.
this is... just a moment, just a moment.
it's rain. I give... I give you my hat and my gloves.
that's very kind, thank you. - Good luck for you.
thank you. Thank you, yeah, bye. - Bye-bye.
just one moment.
God, you frightened me.
you're British. - I am, yeah.
it's okay, you can shelter. Sheltering's free.
no, no, no, no! Rosie, Rosie!
in you go. In, in.
here.
so, you're British, huh? - Yeah.
you anything to do with this fellow, Lang? - In a way, yes.
seems intelligent.
now why did he go and get himself mixed up with that damn fool in the White House?
well, that's what everyone wants to know.
what brings you to this part of the island?
I'm sightseeing.
well, you sure picked a heck of a day for it.
someone I knew was found washed up on the beach there.
you mean the British guy from the ferry? - That's right.
now that was a funny business. - What do you mean?
no way should that current have carried him that far west.
no? - No way!
are you sure?
I've lived here 54 years.
did you mention that to the police?
the police? At my age, I've better things to do, young man.
Annabeth's the one dealing with the police.
your wife?
Annabeth Wurmbrand, Mars Wurmbrand's widow.
she's the one who told them about the lights.
lights? - The flashlights on the beach.
when? - The night the body was washed up.
could, could you, um...
could you point me in the direction of Mrs. Wurmbrand's house?
Oh, sure. You just...
here. Follow it down the beach there.
it's the house nearest the ocean. But she won't talk to you.
why not? - She's in a coma.
fell down stairs a week ago.
been in a coma ever since.
come down!
come down!
dep told me you were here!
what?
I said Dep told me you were here.
we came to get you before the storm came. What are you doing?
just taking the air. - No, really.
I wanted to see where Mike McAra was found.
Why?
Adam's asked me to write something about him in the book.
Where's your bike? - Up there.
Barry, will you come around with the car? We'll meet you out by the road.
I can't do that, I'm afraid, Mrs. Lang. Have to stay with you at all times.
for God's sake!
if we meet any terrorists, I'll text you.
all right, well, stay on the path. Don't speak to anyone.
we won't talk to a soul, Officer, I promise.
poor Mike. I can't bear the idea of him ending up so far from home.
I wonder if we'll ever know whether it was accident or suicide.
can't help you. I never met him.
I suppose it doesn't really matter.
he was drunk. He drowned. End of story.
what was he doing on the ferry? - No idea.
funeral's on Monday, in London.
I'm thinking of going.
one of us should put in an appearance, and it doesn't seem likely to be my husband.
I thought you didn't want to leave him.
rather seems as though he's left me, wouldn't you say?
Hello? - Sorry. I did knock. It's just me.
I brought you some dry clothes. - That's all right. I can manage.
dinner's in an hour, okay?
fine, thanks. For God's sake.
it was at the time of the London elections that I first got to know Ruth.
she had gained a First at Oxford
and then done a year's postgraduate research as a Fulbright scholar.
Ruth.
Mmm.
perfect fit. Now all you need is a drink. - What are we having?
biodynamic white wine from the Rhinehart Vinery in the Napa Valley.
Rhinehart. He doesn't own a distillery, I suppose?
Mmm. Evening news.
for war crimes. Our political editor has more.
Christ, we're the lead story.
pour us some more wine, will you?
I may have to get drunk for a change.
in Washington, Mr. Lang received firm promises of support, both from congressional leaders and the Secretary of State, before going on to a private dinner tonight with the Vice President.
Adam Lang has stood by America's side in the war against terror, and I'm proud to stand by his side this afternoon.
Adam, good to see you. - Thank you.
thank you very much, indeed. It's good to see you.
don't grin.
in Iraq, a suicide bomber...
for God's sake!
Adam.
calling to find out how I think it went.
let him sweat. - Does he always ask for your advice?
Yes, and always usually takes it.
until lately.
are you married? - Certainly not.
gay? - No.
did you have a... - I had a... Um...
what? Girlfriend? - Well, a bit more than that.
partner?
a bit less than that.
I don't know, 40, 000 years of human language and there's no word to describe our relationship.
it was doomed.
come on. Let's eat.
how's it going? - The book?
well, it's not, to be honest. - Sit there.
can I ask you something? - Of course.
I find it difficult to understand certain things.
what things? - Well...
I can't understand why this good-looking lad who goes to Cambridge without the slightest interest in politics and who spends his time acting and chasing girls, - suddenly ends up... - Married to me?
Oh, no, not that. No, not that, at all.
no, what I don't get is why, at 22, he's suddenly a political activist.
I mean, where does that come from? - Didn't you ask him?
he said he joined the party because of you.
told me a great story about you turning up at his place in the rain.
I was gonna start the whole book with it. - And now you're not?
no, I can't. It's not true.
isn't it? - Well, you know it's not.
he'd been a member for two years before he met you.
how do you know that?
I've got a copy of his original party membership card.
Mike McAra found it in the archives.
typical Mike, to ruin a good story with too much research.
did he find anything else?
not much. Cambridge stuff mainly.
you were more political than he was.
I was certainly a change from his Cambridge girlfriends.
all those Jocastas and Pandoras.
and so his marriage to you must have been pretty vital, your knowledge and your contacts in the party.
and I thought he married me for my body.
did you ever want to be a proper politician in your own right?
of course. Didn't you want to be a proper writer?
Ouch.
I'm sorry. I've hurt your feelings.
I suppose even ghosts must have feelings.
we are sensitive spirits.
talking of spirits, could you...
let me get you a proper drink.
white wine, never really seen the point of it.
that's the sort of thing Mike used to say.
Ah! At last, something in common.
do you know the coroner reckoned he'd drunk nearly half a bottle?
that's convenient.
what do you mean? - Nothing.
you think his death was suspicious? - Don't you?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
today at the beach,
I met a man, an old timer who was familiar with the currents.
and he said that there was no way that a body from the ferry could have washed ashore on that spot.
you're kidding.
he also said that there was a woman who saw flashlights on the beach that night.
and then she fell down the stairs, and now she's in a coma. That's all I know.
that's all you know? Jesus.
can I borrow your phone? - Why?
I need to call Adam.
what? - Nothing.
aren't you gonna call him? - Later. I'm going out for a walk.
but it's pitch black. It's pouring with rain.
it'll clear my head. - Well, I'll come with you.
no. Thanks, but I need to work this one through on my own.
stay here. Have another drink. Don't wait up.
are you awake?
well, I am now. - I'm sorry.
it's all right. Hang on.
what time is it? - I don't know.
I called Adam.
And? - Can I come in?
the day before Mike died, he and Adam had a terrible row.
I've never told anyone this before, not even the police.
what about? - I don't know.
but it was furious. They never spoke again.
when I asked Adam about it, he refused to discuss it.
after what you just said, I felt I should ask him again.
and what did he say?
he was having dinner with the Vice President.
that bloody Bly woman wouldn't even give him the phone.
Oh, God. Oh, dear God.
what's he got himself mixed up in?
it's all right. Everything'll be all right.
I'm scared.
I've never been scared in my life before, but I am now.
your hair's all wet, you're drenched. Let me get you a towel.
bad idea.
do you mind?
course not.
the modesty of the morning after?
I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.
you mean you thought I'd be gone?
you've taken out the family tree. He's very proud of the Langs.
you know, if you want a family tree, go to a garden center.
why have you underlined my name every time?
I was surprised there wasn't more about you.
Why? I'm just the wife.
Yeah, even so. You ought not to be written out of history.
why not? Most women are.
then I'll reinstate you.
I'll put in all the occasions that he's forgotten.
how kind. Like the boss's secretary that remembers his wife's birthday for him?
something like that. But then, like you say, I'm not a proper writer.
what are you planning to do? - Leave.
it's not necessary, as far as I'm concerned.
I'm afraid it is, as far as I am.
where will you go? - Back to the hotel.
look, I'm sorry. I should never have stayed in a client's house.
it always ends up with... - With you screwing the client's wife?
no, not always.
but it does make it hard to maintain a professional distance.
and the thing we discussed last night? What do you propose to do about that?
that's none of my business. - Well, you can't just ignore it.
look, I'm his ghostwriter. I'm not an investigative reporter.
what are you gonna do about it? - Perhaps I'll write my own memoirs.
ex-prime Minister's Wife Tells All.
well, if you ever decide to do that, give me a call.
you think I need someone like you to produce my book?
I don't want to be in his bloody memoirs.
he's on his own. I'll get a divorce.
and she can do the prison visits.
morning, sir.
finished for the night, have we? - Why don't you just piss off?
bmw Connected Drive.
traffic is clear to your destination.
join the road when possible.
in 200 yards, turn left.
sorry, lady, but the hotel is right.
turn around when possible.
this is getting ridiculous.
turn around when possible.
all right, you win.
in 50 yards, turn left.
turn left.
you've got to be joking.
single or return?
return. I hope.
forty bucks, please.
have a good one. - Ta.
okay, come on. Come on, keep coming.
a little more. Stop.
in 50 yards, turn left.
please proceed to the indicated road.
in 200 yards, take the next exit.
in half a mile, make a sharp right turn.

paul Emmett?
professor Paul Emmett?
professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University
has written of the unique importance of the English-speaking peoples
in the spread of democracy around the world.
as these nations stand together,
whenever they have faltered, tyranny has gathered strength.
Hello?
is that Mrs. Emmett? - Who is this?
I wondered if I might have a word with Professor Emmett.
do you have an appointment?
it's about Adam Lang. I'm assisting him with his memoirs.
just a moment, please.
this is Paul Emmett. I think you must have made a mistake.
but you were at Cambridge with Mr. Lang?
we were contemporaries, yes, but I can't claim to know him.
I have a photograph of you together.
come on up to the house.
I make it a rule never to see anyone without an appointment.
but your mention of a photograph rather tickled my curiosity.
please, come in. - Thank you.
Yes, he's here now.
may I? - Sure.
Yes. Yes, he's on his own.
he didn't say.
british, about 40.
well, well. I literally have no recollection of this.
but that is you? - Yes, it is.
I was on the board of the Dramat. I had quite a time of it, as you can imagine.
the Dramat? - I'm sorry. The Yale Dramatic Association.
I maintained my theatrical interests when I went to Cambridge for my doctoral research.
could I keep this? - No, I'm afraid not.
I'm sure I could get you a copy. - Would you? That would be kind.
maybe you could tell me how you came by it.
I'd be happy to.
come into my study.
Yes, the wall of ego.
we all have one. It's our equivalent of the dentist's fish tank.
have a seat.
so, the picture.
um...
I've been working with Adam Lang on his memoirs.
Yes, I know, you told me.
Yes, poor Lang. It's bad business, this posturing by The Hague.
as for Rycart, the worst British Foreign Secretary since the war.
lang was right to fire him.
how well do you know Lang? - Hardly at all.
you seem surprised. - He mentions you in his memoirs.
Oh, really?
well, now it's my turn to be surprised. What does he say?
that's very decent of him.
as Prime Minister, he always had good instincts.
but that doesn't mean I know him. - But the...
that. That was taken at a reception in London to mark the 10-year anniversary of the Arcadia.
Arcadia? - Yeah, it's a little organization that I ran.
very highbrow. No reason why you should have heard of it.
the Prime Minister graced us with his presence.
what can you remember of him from Cambridge?
I'm sorry, you don't mind, do you? - No, not at all. Go ahead.
it's just that I'm rather bewildered.
no one's mentioned the Cambridge connection between us in all these years.
but you performed together? - In one production.
it was the summer revue. I can't even remember what it was called.
can I show you something else? - If you must.
Oh, my.
is that what I think it is?
let's hope he didn't inhale.
but that is you standing behind him, isn't it?
I do believe it is.
and I do believe I'm on the point of issuing a stern warning to him on the perils of drug abuse.
is Mr. Lang really going to use these pictures in his memoirs?
if so, I would prefer it if I weren't named.
my children would be mortified.
they're so much more puritanical than we were.
can you tell me about any of the others? - No, I'm afraid not.
the whole summer is a blur, a very happy blur.
now, you were going to tell me about these pictures.
I got them from Michael McAra.
and he is whom, exactly?
my predecessor on Lang's memoirs.
he resigned? - No, he died.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes, a couple of weeks ago. He drove up here to see you.
and he died a few hours afterwards.
he drove up to see me? No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.
how did he die? - He drowned.
poor fellow.
I've never really believed the myth that death by drowning is painless, have you?
seems to me it must be agonizing.
and the police never said anything to you about this?
I've had no contact with the police.
but were you here that weekend?
this would have been January, the 11th and 12th.
a less equable man than I might start to find your questions impertinent.
Nancy?
Nancy?
our visitor wishes to know where we were on the 11th and 12th of January.
do we possess that information?
that was the Colorado weekend.
Yes, of course, the Aspen Institute.
bipolar relationships in a multi-polar world.
sounds fun. - Yes, it was. I was the main speaker.
look, just to return to Cambridge...
no, if you don't mind, let's not return to Cambridge.
I've said all I have to say on that subject.
I'm an avid reader of political memoirs. I'll get hold of Mr. Lang's when they appear.
perhaps he'll send you a copy, for old time's sake.
I doubt that very much.
the gate will open automatically.
be sure to make a right when you get to the end of the drive.
if you turn left, the road will take you deeper into the woods and you may never be seen again.
bmw ConnectedDrive.
when is the last ferry?
you're just in time. - Here, I've got a return.
all right.
ticket? - Uh...
okay. - Okay.
shit.
Hey, you! Stop!
don't do that! Where you going?
man, get out of here! Get out of here, asshole!
shit!
you've reached the office of Rick Ricardelli. Leave a message.
piss off.
what can I do for you, sir?
you wouldn't happen to know if there are any flights leaving the airport tonight, would you?
not unless you've got your own private jet.
I lent it to my butler.
you Brits!
there's a flight to Boston - 8: 30 tomorrow morning. - Shit!
how much for a room? - For you, $89.
I'll pay cash. - Who's got your card? The nanny?
you rang back.
are you going to stay on the line this time?
Yes.
I've been trying to call you.
I know, I'm sorry...
it didn't seem right, speaking to you.
who are you?
I'm the new ghostwriter...
no names, don't use any names.
how did you get this number?
it was in my predecessor's effects.
the...
the thing is, I'm in trouble.
is it because of your client?
Yeah.
there's something wrong, but I didn't know who to talk to.
where are you? Without being too specific. On the island?
I'm in the... No, I'm on the mainland, on the... This motel by the ferry.
room number?
201
have you got the book with you? - Yeah.
okay. Stay there.
Hatherton?
with $35 billion of funds at its disposal, the Hatherton Group brings together a family of companies devoted to defense and security.
and with unrivaled expertise in the Middle East, including the services of two former Presidents, three Prime Ministers and two directors of the CIA,
Hatherton is proud to stand at the forefront of the struggle against terror.
Hatherton, a shelter from harm.
according to CIA whistleblower Frank Molinari,
Yale graduate Paul Emmett
was reported to have joined the Agency as an officer in 1971,
and was assigned to the Foreign Resources Division of the Directorate of...
1971?
it's 1974.
Hello? - You're alive.
Yeah, just about.
I've been worried sick.
the police called to say they'd found the car on the ferry. Again!
I'm so sorry. I parked it, and then, and then I got off the boat.
what the hell were you doing on the mainland, anyway?
I drove to New York. - Why?
I needed to see John Maddox.
and where are you now?
I'm still at the ferry terminal. I missed the last crossing.
you really are bloody hopeless!
I just had Adam on the phone, trying to get hold of you.
he's flying back tonight. He sounds in a right state.
you didn't tell him about us, did you?
God's sake, Ruth!
I've got to go. I'll call you back.
who is it? - Mr. Rycart sent me.
hold on.
just gonna do a quick check, if you don't mind.
get your stuff together. We're leaving.
Hey! That's private!
he's clean. - Thanks, Frank.
sorry about that. Please, get in.
you thought it was a trap? - It crossed my mind.
you do work for Lang.
Yeah, for three days. I hardly know the guy.
who does? I worked for him for 15 years, till he fired me, and I still can't fathom him.
Yeah, his wife said more or less the same.
there you go. If someone as sharp as Ruth can't get him, what hope do we have?
tough day? - Yeah, you could say that.
you have the book?
Yeah.
he's got it.
before we go any further, I wonder if I might take a look at that book.
no. Before we go any further, there's a few things I'd like to know first.
such as, why did Mike McAra have your number?
okay. Sure.
he was helping me.
McAra? How?
Mike found the documents linking Lang to the torture flights.
what? It was McAra who gave you the documents?
Yeah, Mike McAra. The loyalest of the loyal. - But why?
he didn't like discovering he was working for a war criminal.
would you?
Oh, I forgot. You are.
the book?
well, don't tell me you're gonna read it now.
not all of it. Just the beginning.
there's something very important about it.
Yeah. It's the cure for insomnia.
there you go, guys. Can I get you anything else?
no, thanks, love.
Mike said he'd discovered something new. It's the last time he called me.
he said it explained everything that had gone wrong when we were in government.
what was it? - He wouldn't say over the phone.
he just kept saying if anything happened to him, the truth was in Lang's memoirs.
it's all there in the beginning.
the beginning?
then he means Cambridge.
what the hell's this?
that is Lang, and that is Paul Emmett.
Emmett? The Arcadia guy. So what?
on the day that Mike McAra died, he drove up to see Emmett, and I think he was murdered on his way home.
what? - I went to see Emmett today, and two guys followed me from his house. That's why I called you.
at the time that this photograph was taken,
paul Emmett was an officer in the CIA.
Emmett?
foreign Resources Division. - Oh, my God.
you realize how important this is, don't you?
this explains why Lang went into politics.
everyone knows he didn't have a political thought in his pretty little head.
this is why he rose so quickly, with a little help from his friends.
well, do you think it's possible... - Okay, a quiz for you.
name one decision Lang made in 10 years as Prime Minister which wasn't in the interests of the USA.
well, come on, it's not a trick question.
iraq, Middle East policy, Star Wars defense, buying American nuclear missiles, support of terrorist rendition.
the sacking of any minister Washington didn't like, including yours truly.
McAra was right.
this explains everything.
it's Amelia Bly.
answer it.
Hello, Amelia. - Good evening. I have Adam for you.
Lang.
we're coming to get you.
what?
ruth tells me you're stuck at the ferry terminal.
we've just taken off from New York.
pilot says we can stop by and pick you up.
Really? There's no need.
we've got a book to write, remember?
hold on a sec, Adam.
he said he wants to pick me up in his private jet.
say yes. - What if it's a trap?
if you refuse, he'll get suspicious. Tell him yes.
that'd be great, Adam. Yeah, thanks. I'll get to the airport.
see you there.
he sounds worried.
I really don't think this is a good idea.
you have no choice.
Emmett must have told Lang that I'd been to see him.
so, what's he gonna do about it? Dump you in the ocean?
well, it happened before! - Which means it can't happen again.
he can't drown two ghostwriters, for God's sake. You're not kittens.
all this is just theory. We don't have any proof.
you'll get us the proof. - Me?
you're his ghostwriter. Presumably, he lets you tape him.
I use discs, actually. - Discs, tapes.
you've got to confront him with this. Record his reaction.
even if he denies it, it's something.
I'm in a tricky position here. I signed a confidentiality agreement.
it's a bit late for that.
it means the discs are his property. - The court can subpoena them.
and what if I don't record any discs?
then you'll be subpoenaed and forced to repeat this whole story.
then I'll deny it.
then I'll give them this.
Frank is recording every word.
aren't you, Frank?
Oh! Come on!
don't look so shocked. What did you expect?
that I'd come into a meeting with a man working for Lang without taking any precautions?
except you're not working for Lang anymore.
you're working for the good guys.
you know all this is pointless, don't you?
in the end, he'll just retire over here with his CIA pension, and he'll tell you and the bloody war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves.
good evening, sir. Hatherton welcomes you aboard.
thank you.
it's my first time in a private jet.
well, let's hope it's not your last.
Hi, man.
take your seat. - Thanks.
Hey, bring my ghost a Calvados. - Yes, sir.
do you mind?
leave it off for now.
ruth said you were in New York to see Maddox.
that's right. - How was he?
he was fine.
full of energy?
you know John. - Yes, I do know John.
as a matter of fact, I was just with him.
you never saw him today, did you?
no.
do you have something to tell me?
I went to see Emmett.
that windbag! Why?
I know about you and Emmett.
me and Emmett? - I know that he was your...
my? - ...handler, if that's what they're called.
my handler? - Yeah, that he was your handler in the CIA.
Oh, my God.
you're serious, aren't you?
when McAra found this, he went to Boston to show it to Emmett, and he died on the way home, and I think he was murdered.
I think you've had a few too many of those already.
it was McAra who believed that Emmett told you to go into politics in the first place.
Emmett? I barely knew the man. - And that story of yours about why you joined the party and Ruth and the canvassing, well, the dates don't fit.
I got the dates wrong. Big deal!
then when he found this photograph, and he heard the rumors about Emmett being in the CIA...
rumors? - It's on the Internet.
I've never heard such utter balls in my entire life.
Mike would never have believed such crap. He was too clever. Too loyal.
Mike betrayed you to Rycart.
how do you know that? - He told me.
Rycart?
he's lying.
this phone number on the back of the photograph, it's Rycart's.
the handwriting, that's McAra's.
Mike.
Mike, Mike. - And you knew he was disillusioned.
you had a big row with him just before he died.
Yes, I know, but he never mentioned this. This is just... This is grotesque.
I've never taken orders from anyone.
whatever I did, I did because I believed it was right.
what, even supporting illegal kidnapping for torture?
Oh, for God's sake, spare me the bleeding-heart bullshit!
do you know what I'd do if I was in power again?
I'd have two queues at airports.
one for flights where we'd done no background checks, infringed on no one's civil bloody liberties, used no intelligence gained by torture.
and on the other flight, we'd do everything we possibly could to make it perfectly safe.
and then we'd see which plane the Rycarts of this world would put their bloody kids on!
and you can put that in the book!
go home!
go home!
here comes the killer!
prosecute for torture!
over here, Mr. Lang!
Mr. Lang! Mr. Lang, will you live in America?
Mr. Lang, will you take American citizenship?
when we get back to the house, we need to have a meeting.
Oh, my God! - Murderer!
firing from the roof!
let me go to him! No! No!
move, move, move!
how long had you known Mr. Lang?
couple of days. - In what capacity?
I was his ghost.
his ghostwriter.
do you recognize this man?
he was one of the protesters. His son was killed in Iraq.
did you ever speak with him?
he was in the bar one night in the hotel where I was staying.
but did you speak with him?
he asked me if I knew where Adam Lang was staying on the island.
I told him that I didn't. - Did you report this conversation?
sorry?
did you report this conversation to Mr. Lang's protection team?
no.
what was Mr. Lang's demeanor this evening?
he was... He was fine. He seemed fine.
one witness said she thought she heard Mr. Lang shouting at you.
no.
we're gonna need your passport. - Why?
a serious crime was just committed in US territory, and you're the key witness.
we need to keep you close.
like a fallen soldier, Adam Lang went home today, home to a shocked and grieving nation.
not just his family, but friends and political opponents joined in tribute.
a great colleague and a true patriot.
we had our disagreements, but we always stayed friends.
my heart goes out to Ruth and the family.
and I would like to say Adam will be...
who is it?
Congratulations!
on what now?
still having me as your agent. Hmm?
they don't need you anymore.
you're free to go.
you ready to get back to work? - I don't think I can, Rick.
I'm sorry. Not after all this. - Don't be a jerk.
this is a hot book now. It's Adam Lang's voice from the grave.
the guy, he's a hero. - I just want to go home.
you can.
go. Go home. And finish the book from London.
I don't know, Rick.
here we are.
Oh, here we are.
I'm sorry.
I think I'm over it, and then suddenly I realize I'm not.
are you sure this is all right? - Of course. My invitation said plus one.
only I wondered if you might've wanted to bring your husband.
that didn't work out.
I hadn't appreciated quite how bored he was with being my plus one.
shall we go in? - Yeah.
Amelia Bly, plus one. - Thank you.
that was a bit of a turn-up, for the books, you calling me.
I heard you weren't invited, and I thought you should be here.
ghosts are never invited to the launch party, as a rule.
we're an embarrassment. Like a mistress at a wedding.
sorry.
I brought you a present.
thank you.
that's very funny.
I thought, seeing as you were so keen to hold onto it, you might like it as a souvenir.
between you and me, it wasn't us, it was the Americans.
they thought the book was a potential threat to national security.
but there's nothing in it.
something about the beginnings. I think that's what I heard.
the beginning? - No, beginnings. The beginnings.
beginnings?
you all right?
do you know that man? The one who's speaking to Ruth.
paul Emmett? - What's he doing here?
well, he was Ruth's tutor at Harvard when she was a Fulbright scholar.
why shouldn't he be here?
do you mind if I have that back a second?
I'm...
madam? - No, thank you.
Langs are Scottish folk, originally.
wife and child in tow, I decided to...
I decided to settle.
ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please.
thank you. I'd like to ask Ruth Lang to say a few words.
I miss Adam all the time.
but never more than tonight.
not just 'cause we're meeting to launch his wonderful new book and he should be here to share the joy of his life story with us, but because he was so brilliant at making speeches and I'm so terrible.
Langs are Scottish folk.
wife and child, Langs are Scottish.
wife, Langs. Lang's wife.
Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University.
well, you'll be relieved to hear I'm not making a speech this evening.
I just want to thank our wonderful publishers,
Marty Rhinehart and John Maddox, and our attorney and friend, Sidney Kroll.
and finally, but especially, Mike McAra.
Mike, our thoughts are with you.
in these very difficult few months, I've drawn great comfort from this book, from knowing that, despite the terrible double tragedy of losing both of them,
Mike and Adam did at least live long enough to complete it.
and I really believe that, as people read these pages,
Adam's voice will keep on coming through for generations to come, eloquent, strong and full of hope.
thanks to his words, he is with us still.
if I've left out anyone's name, I hope you'll forgive me.
but now I must make a toast.
to the memory of a great man and a great patriot, a wonderful husband and a devoted father.
to Adam!
to Adam!
you were marvelous.
would you...
this one looks nasty.
Yeah, it's just happened just now. Yeah, if you could.
good night, sweetheart.
night, Mom.
sleep tight, kiddo.
simulation terminated.
simulation terminated.
simulation terminated.
simulation terminated.
simulation terminated.
all right. Mr. Bile, is it?
my friends call me Phlegm.
Mr. Bile, can you tell me what you did wrong?
I fell down?
no, no, before that.
can anyone tell me Mr. Bile's big mistake?
anyone?
let's take a look at the tape.
here we go.
all Right... Pa, pa...
there.
see? The door.
you left it wide open.
and leaving the door open is the worst mistake any employee can make because...
it could let in a draft?
it could let in a child.
Oh.
Mr. Waternoose.
there's nothing more toxic or deadly than a human child.
a single touch could kill you.
leave a door open, and a child could walk right into this factory, right into the monster world.
I won't go in a kid's room.
you can't make me.
you're going in there, because we need this.
our city is counting on you to collect those children's screams.
without scream, we have no power.
Yes, it's dangerous work.
and that's why I need you to be at your best.
I need scarers who are confident, tenacious, tough and intimidating.
I need scarers like...like...James P.Sullivan.
Hey, good morning, Monstropolis.
it's five after the hour of 6: 00 a.m. in the big Monster City.
the temperature's a balmy 65 degrees which is good news for you reptiles.
and it looks like it's gonna be a perfect day...
to maybe, hey, lie in bed, sleep in, or simply work out that flab that's hanging over the bed!
get up, Sulley!
I don't believe I ordered a wake-up call, Mike.
Hey. Less talk, more pain, marshmallow boy!
feel the burn.
you call yourself a monster?
scary feet, scary feet, scary feet.
Oh. The kid's awake!
okey. Scary feet, scary feet... scary...
kid's asleep!
twins!
in a bunk bed!
I thought I had you there.
OK, Sulley, here we go.
you ready?
follow it.
Oh. It's over here.
Oh. Look over there.
don't let the kid touch you.
don't let him touch you!
I don't know but it's been said...
I love scarin' kids in bed.
come on. Fight that plaque.
fight that plaque.
scary monsters don't have plaque.
one - eighteen.
do you have 119?
do I see 120?
Oh. I don't believe it.
I'm not breaking a sweat.
not you.
look! The new commercial's on.
the future is bright at Monsters, Incorporated.
I'm in this one, I'm in this one.
we power your car.
we warm your home.
we light your city.
I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
Hey, look! Betty!
carefully matching every child to their ideal monster, to produce superior scream.
refined into clean, dependable energy.
every time you turn something on, Monsters, Incorporated is there.
I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
we know the challenge.
the window of innocence is shrinking.
human kids are harder to scare.
of course, MI is prepared for the future.
with the top scarers, the best refineries, and research into new energy techniques.
OK, here I come.
we're working for a better tomorrow, today.
we're Monsters, Incorporated.
we're MI, Monsters, Incorporated.
we scare because we care.
I can't believe it.
Oh Mike.
I was on TV!
ha! Did you see me?
I'm a natural.
Hello?
I know!
wasn't I great?
did the whole family see it?
it's your mom.
haha... what can I say?
the camera loves me.
I'm telling you, Big Daddy, you're gonna be seeing this face on TV more often.
yeah?
like on the Monstropolis' Most Wanted?
you've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade.
have a good day, sweetie.
you too, hon.
OK, Sulley, hop on in.
Nope.
Hey, hey... where you going?
Mike, there's a scream shortage.
we're walking.
walking?
Yep
no. Hey. No, no...
my baby, look, she needs to be driven.
my baby.
I'll call you.
Hey, you wanna know why I bought the car?
not really.
to drive it.
you know, like on the street with the honk-honk and the vroom-vroom no walking involved.
give it a rest, will you, butterball?
come on. You could use the exercise.
I could use the exercise? Look at you.
yea, you have your own climate.
how many tentacles jump the rope?
morning, Mike. Morning, Sulley.
Hey. Morning, kids.
how you doing?
Bye, Mike.
Bye, Sulley.
Hey!
Oh. Nuts.
Hey, hey, hey. Fellas.
Hey, Tony.
Tony.
bada-bing.
I hear somebody's close to breaking the all-time scare record.
just trying to make sure there's enough scream to go around.
Hey, on the house.
Hey, thanks.
bada-bing.
Oh, great.
Hey, Ted, good morning.
see that, Mike?
Ted's walking to work.
no big deal.
this guy takes five steps and he's there.
monsters, Inc. Please hold.
monsters, Inc. Please hold.
monsters, Inc...
mornin', Sulley.
mornin', Ricky.
Hey. It's the Sullster.
see you on the scare floor. Buddy.
Hey. Marge.
Hey. How was jury duty?
morning, Sulley.
Hey.
Hey. It's still leaning to the left.
it is not.
Hey, fellas. Hey, Jerry.
morning.
Hey, Mr. Sullivan.
guys, I told you, call me Sulley.
I don't think so.
we just want to wish you good luck today.
Hey, hey, come on, get lost, you two.
you're making him lose his focus.
sorry.
see you later, fellas.
go get 'em, Mr. Sullivan.
quiet. You're making him lose his focus.
Oh, no. Sorry!
shut up!
monsters, Inc. Please hold.
monsters, Inc. I'll connect you.
miss Fearmonger is on vacation.
would you like her voicemail?
Oh. Schmoopsie - pooh.
googly bear.
happy birthday.
Oh. Googly - woogly, you remembered.
Hey, Sulley - wulley.
Hey, Celia - wheelia.
happy birthday.
Thanks.
so are we going anywhere special tonight?
I just got us into a little place called Harryhausen's.
Harryhausen's?
but it's impossible to get a reservation there.
not for googly bear.
I will see you at quittin' time.
not a minute later.
OK, sweetheart.
think romantical thoughts.
you and me. Me and you
both of us together
you know, pal, she's the one.
that's it. She is the one.
I'm happy for you.
Oh. And thanks for hooking me up with those reservations.
no problem. They're under the name: googly bear.
Oh. Good idea.
you know, that wasn't very funny.
what the...
Wazowski.
what do you know?
it scares little kids, and little monsters.
I wasn't scared. I have allergies.
Uh-hum, Sure.
Hey, Randall, save it for the scare floor, will you?
I'm in the zone today, Sullivan.
gonna do serious scaring.
putting up some big numbers.
wow, Randall, that's great.
that should make it more humiliating, when we break the record first. Ha ha.
do you hear that?
it's the winds of change.
you hear that? It's the winds of...#&%@
what a creep.
one of these days I am really gonna let you teach that guy a lesson.
Chalooby.
baby.
good morning, Roz, my succulent little garden snail.
and, who would we be scaring today?
Wazowski.
you didn't file your paperwork last night.
Oh, that darn paperwork.
wouldn't it be easier if it all just blew away?
don't let it happen again.
Yes. Well, I'll try to be less careless.
I'm watching you, Wazowski.
always watching.
Oh. She's nuts.
all scare floors are now active.
assistants, please report to your stations.
OK, people, Eastern Seaboard coming online.
we got scarers coming out.
Oooh. They are so awesome.
Hey, may the best monster win.
I plan to.
we are on in seven, six, five, four, three, two...
you're the boss, you're the boss. You're the big hairy boss.
Oh I'm feeling good today, Mike.
attaboy, attaboy. Another door coming right up.
you're still behind, Randall.
maybe I should realign the scream...
just get me another door.
the door, yes, door.
well, Jerry, what's the damage so far?
we may actually make our quota today, sir.
first time in a month.
what happened?
the kid almost touched me.
she got this close to me.
she wasn't scared of you?
she was only six.
I could have been dead.
I could have died.
keep it together, man.
Hey, we got a dead door over here.
I'm coming.
look out.
excuse us.
we've lost 58 doors this week, sir.
kids these days.
they just don't get scared like they used to.
let her rip.
sir?
what?
look.
attention.
we have a new scare leader.
Randall Boggs.
look at those numbers.
slumber party.
never mind.
Hey, watch it.
well, James, that was an impressive display.
no. Just doing my job, Mr. Waternoose.
course I did learn from the best.
if I don't see a new door in my station in five seconds, I will personally put you through the shredder.
Hey, Wazowski, nice job.
those numbers are pretty sweet.
are they? You know, I hadn't even noticed.
and how's Georgie doing?
he's doing great.
I love working with that big guy.
keep the doors coming, Charlie.
I'm on a roll today.
george and I are like brothers.
2319!
we have a 2319!
red alert.
red alert.
red alert.
red alert.
george Sanderson.
please remain motionless.
prepare for decontamination.
duck and cover, people!
Oh. Not the CDA.
go, go, go.
coming through. Please, stand aside.
clear the contaminated area.
no.
a 2319 in progress.
area Clear. Coming through. Watch yourself.
stand back.
careful.
all clear.
situation is: nine-nine-zero.
ready for decon.
Hey. Thanks, guys, that was a close one.
OK.
OK, people. Take a break.
we gotta shut down for half hour and reset the system.
an entire scare floor out of commission.
what else can go wrong?
what a day.
we're just going through a rough time, sir.
everyone knows you'll get us through it.
tell that to the board of directors.
James, this company's been in my family for three generations.
I would do anything to keep it from going under.
so would I, sir.
I could use your help with something.
anything, sir.
you see, we've hired some new scare recruits, and frankly, they're...they're...eh...
inexperienced?
no, they stink.
I thought maybe you might come by tomorrow and give them a demonstration.
show them what it takes to be our top scarer.
I'll start out with the old Waternoose jump and growl.
now that's my boy.
let's go, everybody.
all doors must be returned.
no exceptions.
I've never seen anything like you today.
you were on a roll, my man.
another day like this and that scare record's in the bag.
that's right, baby.
Lets's get this. As if dinner wasn't enough, I'm taking her to a monster truck rally afterwards.
nice.
what's on your agenda?
I'm going home. Work out some more.
again?
you know, there's more to life than scaring.
Hey. Can I borrow your odorant?
Yeah, I got smelly garbage, or old dumpster.
you got low tide?
no.
how about wet dog?
Yep. Stink it up.
you know, I am so romantic, sometimes I think I should just marry myself.
give me a break. Mike
what a night of romance got ahead of me.
tonight is about me and Celia.
the love boat is about to set sail.
cause I gotta tell you, buddy, that face of hers, it just makes my heart go...
Hello, Wazowski.
fun-filled evening planned for tonight?
well, as a matter of fact...
and I'm sure you filed your paperwork correctly, for once.
your stunned silence is very reassuring.
Oh, no. My scare reports.
I left them on my desk.
if I'm not at the restaurant in five minutes, they'll give our table away.
what am I gonna do?
schmoopsie-pooh.
Hey, googly bear, want to get going?
uh... Do I ever...
it's just...
what?
OK, it's...It's just a small...
I don't understand.
it's just I forgot about some paperwork I was supposed to file.
Mike was reminding me.
Thanks, buddy.
I was?
I mean, I was. Yeah. I was.
OK. Let's go.
we're going.
on my desk, Sulley.
the pink copies to accounting.
the fuchsia ones go to purchasing, and the goldenrod ones go to Roz
leave the puce.
pink copies to accounting, fuchsia ones to Roz.
no. The fuchsia ones go to purchasing.
the goldenrod ones go to Roz.
man, I have no idea what puce is.
Oh, that's puce.
Hello?
anyone?
there's a door here.
Hello?
Hey.
anybody scaring in here?
hello.
yo.
Kitty.
no, no, stay back.
hold it, hold it.
Oh, Michael,
I've had a lot of birthdays...
well, not a lot of birthdays.
but this is the best birthday ever.
what are you looking at?
I was just thinking about the first time I laid eye on you, how pretty you looked.
stop it.
your hair was shorter.
I'm thinking about getting it cut.
no, no, I like it this length.
I like everything about you.
just the other day someone asked me who I thought the most beautiful monster was in Monstroplis.
you know what I said?
what did you say?
I said...
Sulley?
Sulley?
no, no, no, that's not what I was gonna say.
Michael, you're not making sense.
he's handsome. He's rugged.
what a coincidence, running into you.
I'm just gonna order something to go.
Michael.
Sulley!
what's good here?
get out of here. You're ruining everything.
I went to get your paperwork, and there was a door.
what?
a door?
Randall was in it.
wait a minute. Randall?
that cheater.
he's trying to boost his numbers.
there's something else.
what?
what?
look in the bag.
what bag?
they don't have anything I like here.
so take care, Celia.
what's going on?
Celia, please try to understand.
I have to do something!
Michael?
on three.
one, two...
a kid!
Boo!
a kid!
there's a kid here. A human kid!
googly bear!
come on.
let's get out of here.
please remain calm.
this is not a drill.
7835 in progress, please advise.
Michael? Michael!
Celia!
please come with me.
stop pushing.
Hey. Get your hands off my schmoopsie-pooh.
area clear. Ready for decontamination.
well. I don't think that date could have gone any worse.
if witnesses are to be believed, there has been a child security breach for the first time in monster history.
we can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here tonight.
well, a kid flew right over me, and blasted a car with its laser vision.
I tried to run from it, but it picked me up with its mind powers and shook me like a doll.
it's true. I saw the whole thing.
it is my professional opinion that now is the time to panic.
it's coming. It's coming!
Boo!
here. Come here, kid.
no. Don't touch those, you little...
those were alphabetized.
it's OK. It's all right
as long as it doesn't come near us, we're gonna be OK.
you... You like this?
fetch.
Hey, hey. That's it.
no one touches Little Mike.
Mike, give her the bear.
Oh, no!
make it stop, Sulley.
make it stop!
here, look. See bear? Here.
Wow. Nice bear.
Sulley!
bear, he's a happy bear.
he's not crying, neither should you.
or we'll be in trouble 'cause they're gonna find us, so please stop crying now. Right now
good. Good, Sulley.
keep it up. You're doing great.
he's a happy bear. He has no...
it touched me. It touched me.
Sulley, the bear!
the bear. Give her the...
what was that?
I have no idea, but it would be really great if it didn't do it again.
how could I do this?
how could I be so stupid?
this could destroy the company.
the company? Who cares about the company?
what about us?
that thing is a killing machine.
I bet it's just waiting for us to fall asleep and then... wham!
we're easy prey, my friend.
easy prey. We're sitting targets.
OK, look, I think I have a plan here.
using mainly spoons, we dig a tunnel under the city and release it into the wild.
spoons.
that's it. I'm out of ideas.
we are closed.
air balloon, too expensive.
giant slingshot, too conspicuous.
enormous wooden horse, too Greek.
no. Can't think.
can't think.
flatliner. Flatlining.
Oh, Mike?
I think she's getting tired.
well, then why don't you find someplace for it to sleep while I think of a plan!
are you sleepy? Wanna sleep?
is that what you want?
OK. All right.
making a nice little area for you to...
no. Hey, Hey, that's my bed.
you're gonna get your germs all over it.
fine. My chair's more comfortable anyway.
what?
it's just a closet.
will you go to sleep?
Hey, that looks like Randall.
Randall's your monster.
you think he's gonna come through the closet and scare you.
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?
it's empty.
see?
no monster in here.
well, now there is.
but I'm not gonna scare you.
I'm off duty.
OK.
how about I sit here until you fall asleep?
go ahead. Go to sleep.
now. Now go.
you...
go...
to...
sleep.
Hey, Mike, this might sound crazy, but I don't think that kid's dangerous.
Really?
well, in that case, let's keep it.
I always wanted a pet that could kill me!
now, look, what if we just put her back in her door?
what?
Mike, think about it.
we send her back just like it never happened, everything goes back to normal.
is that a joke?
tell me you're joking.
Sulley, I think that given the circumstances
I've been extremely forgiving up to now.
but that is a horrible idea.
what are we gonna do?
march in public with that thing?
then I guess we just waltz right up to the factory, right?
I can't believe we are waltzing right up to the factory.
Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights and some chair fabric
I'm not gonna fool anyone.
just think about a few names. Will you?
Loch Ness. Bigfoot. The Abominable Snowman.
they all got one thing in common, pal.
Banishment!
we could be next.
don't panic. We can do this.
Hey, how you doing, Frank?
Hey, guys.
everything's going to be OK.
number one wants this place dusted for prints.
careful with that.
I got a good view from here.
a little lower.
this was recovered at the scene.
don't panic. Don't panic.
don't tell me not to panic.
##Just keep it together.@@##It's not OK.
boo.
could be contaminated.
gentlemen, safety is our number-one concern.
if there's anything that...
no. Not now. Not now. I'm...
Oh, hello, little one.
where did you come from?
Mr. Waternoose!
aha, James, is this one yours?
actually, that's my cousin's sister's
uh... daughter, sir.
Yeah, it's... it's bring an Obscure Relative to Work Day.
must have missed the memo.
well, listen, James, why don't you stop by the simulator after lunch today and give us that scare demonstration.
we talked about?
Yeah. Oh, Oh, sir...
Mr. Waternoose?
Yes, yes. I'm coming.
all right, then. I'll see you this afternoon, James.
that is, if these gentlemen haven't shut us down.
Oh, boy.
a scare demo.
well. That is great.
why am I the last to know?
we could bring your cousin's sister's daughter along.
she'll be a big hit.
halt.
hold him down.
come on. The coast is clear.
OK.
all we have to do is get rid of that thing.
so wait here while I get its card key.
but she can't stay here.
this is the men' s room.
that is the weirdest thing you've ever said.
it's fine. It's OK.
look. It loves it here.
it's dancing with joy.
I'll be right back with its door key.
that's a cute little dance you got.
it almost looks like you've got to...
are you done in there?
sorry, sorry.
OK. You're finished now, right?
Hello?
boo.
where did she go?
did she disappear?
did she turn invisible?
I just have no idea.
gotcha.
boo.
Hey, you're good.
be relaxed. Be relaxed. Be relaxed.
Roz, my tender oozing blossom.
you're looking fabulous today.
is that a new haircut?
come on, tell me, it's a new haircut, isn't it?
it's got to be new makeup, new makeup.
you had a lift. You had a tuck.
you had something.
something has been inserted in your skin that makes you look like...
listen, I need a favor.
Randall was working late last night on the scare floor.
I really need the key for the door he was using.
well, isn't that nice?
but guess what?
you didn't turn in your paperwork last night.
he didn't... I...No paperwork?
this office is now closed.
ready or not, here I come.
I'm getting warmer.
any second now.
what are you doing?
I'm looking for the kid.
you lost it?
no, no. She was just...
here she is.
Hey. What's the matter?
I already told your buddies.
all right. Carry on.
Randall. Thank goodness.
what are we gonna do about the child?
the front page.
it's on the front page.
the child. The one you were after.
will you be quiet?
don't you think I'm aware of the situation?
I was up all night trying to find it.
I did a simple calculation factoring in the size of the sushi restaurant.
the child may have escaped!
yea. Until we know for sure we're gonna act like nothing happened.
understand?
you will just get the machine up and running.
I'll take care of the kid.
when I find whoever let it out, they're dead.
why are you still here?
come on, go!
move! Now!
I'm not here.
they're gone.
this is bad, it's so very bad.
what were they talking about machine?
who cares?
look, don't panic.
all we have to do is call her door and send her home.
you are right. You are right.
we're just two regular Joes on our way to work.
and we will blend right in.
top of the morning, fellows.
Hey. What's shakin', bacon?
did you lose weight?
or a limb?
you have her card key, right?
of course. I have her card key
I told you I'd get her card key.
I went and got her card key.
now I have her card key.
OK. Here we go.
take care of yourself.
try not to run through any more closets.
Mike, that's not her door.
what are you talking about?
of course it's her door.
it's her door.
no.
her door was white, and it had flowers on it.
no. It must have been dark last night, because this is its door.
Hey, you hear that?
sounds like fun in there.
OK.
send me a postcard, kid.
that's Mike Wazowski, care of 22 Mike Wazowski, you-got-your-life-back Lane.
very good. Now bon voyage.
Bye-bye.
come on.
look at the stick. See the stick?
go, get the stick.
go fetch.
Mike, this isn't Boo's door.
boo?
what's Boo?
that's what I decided to call her.
there a problem?
Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.
once you name it, you start getting attached to it.
now put that thing back where it came from, or so help me...
Oh. Hey.
we're rehearsing a scene for the upcoming company play, called Put That Thing Back Where It Came From, or So Help Me.
it's a musical.
put that thing back where it came from or so help me
so help me, so help me
and cut.
we're still working on it. It's in progress, but we need ushers.
Sulley, I've had enough.
now say goodbye to...
where did it go? What did you do?
where is she?
I don't believe it.
she got away from you again?
well, that is just...
wait a minute. The sun is coming up.
this is perfect.
she's gone!
where are you going?
Sulley, please, don't blow this.
we're so close to breaking the record.
somebody else will find the kid.
it'll be their problem. Not ours.
she's out of our hair!
what are you two doing?
they're rehearsing a play.
she's out of our hair
hid it. Mike Wazowski!
so, what do you think of that kid getting out, Sullivan?
pretty crazy, Uh?
Oh, yeah, crazy.
word on the street is the kid's been traced back to this factory.
you haven't seen anything? Have you?
uh... Well...Uh...
no. No way.
but if it was an inside job,
I'd put my money on Waxford.
Waxford?
yea. The one at station six.
you know. He's got them shifty eyes.
Hey, Waxford.
Sulley!
michael Wazowski!
last night was one of the worst nights of my entire life, bar none!
I thought you cared about me.
honey, please.
I thought you liked sushi.
sushi?
sushi!
you think this is about sushi?
Wazowski.
Michael!
Mich...
men.
breathe. Keep breathing.
Where's the kid?
kid?
what kid?
it's here in the factory, isn't it?
you are not putting this on me.
it never would have gotten out, if you hadn't been cheating last night.
cheating?
cheating.
right.
OK.
I think I know how to make this all go away.
what happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?
I get a timeout?
everyone goes to lunch.
which means the scare floor will be Painted?
empty.
it'll be empty, you idiot.
you see that clock?
when the big hand is pointing up, and the little hand is pointing up, the kid's door will be in my station.
but when the big hand points down, the door will be gone.
you have until then to put the kid back.
get the picture?
Boo!
no.
Hey, you.
halt.
he's the one.
the one from the commercial.
confirmed. That's him.
can we get an autograph?
Oh, sure. No problem.
make that out to Stephanie, my daughter.
Yes. Let's see.
from your scary friend. Best wishes.
so, then I said, If you talk to me like that again, we're through.
what' d she say?
you know my mom.
she sent me to my room.
see you guys later. Take it easy.
bottoms up.
Boo!
Hi.
well, hello, there.
what's your name?
Mike Wazowski.
Sulley!
Oh, Sulley.
OK, Sulley, come on, come on.
Hey! You guys seen Sulley anywhere?
Nope, sorry.
Oh. Sulley!
boy
Wazowski looks like he's in trouble.
we have a 2319!
Oh, dear.
Sulley!
Sulley!
Sulley.
great news, pal.
I got us a way out of this mess, but we gotta hurry.
where is it?
Sulley, that's a cube of garbage.
I can still hear her little voice.
Mike Wazowski.
Hey. I can hear it too.
Mike Wazowski!
how many kids you got in there?
Mike Wazowski!
Kitty!
Boo!
boo, you're all right.
I was so worried. I was...
don't you ever run away from me again, young lady.
but I'm so glad you're safe.
my, what an affectionate father.
actually, she's my cousin's sister's.
OK, Sulley. That's enough. Let's go.
Mike Wazowski.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Sure.
step aside, kid. We're in a...
will you stop making Boo laugh?
I didn't. Come on.
I still don't understand.
you got Boo's door?
I'll explain later. Run.
OK. Let's move.
let's move, let's move. Come on.
Oh. Please be there. please be there.
there it is, just like Randall said.
Randall?
wait a minute.
boo, hey.
one, two, three, four, get the kid through the door.
we are gonna get our lives back.
the nightmare is over.
Hey. It's OK, Boo.
Hey. What's the matter?
come on. It's time to move.
Mike, what are you thinking?
we can't trust Randall.
he's after Boo.
who cares? Let's go.
this is a limited-time offer.
no. no. I don't like this.
look, Sulley, you wanted her door and there it is.
now let's move.
no, Mike.
you want me to prove everything's on the up and up?
fine!
he wants a door, I get a door.
##Mike, wait.@@##You don't want the door.
paranoid delusional furball.
Mike!
Hey, Sulley, where you been all day?
Sulley?
Sulley!
Mike?
Mike?
where are you?
are you in there?
where are you, buddy?
Mike?
where are you?
boo, way to go.
it's OK.
Randall, did you have to...
Yes! I got the kid.
Oh, huzzah!
that's great news.
not that I was concerned.
just get over here and help me.
come on, come on, come on, come on, while we're young here, Fungus.
the kid needs to take off a few pounds.
Wazowski!
where is it, you little one-eyed cretin?
OK. First, It's cretin.
if you're gonna threaten me, do it properly.
second, you're nuts if you think kidnapping me is gonna help you cheat your way to the top!
you still think this is about that stupid scare record?
well, I did.
right up until you chuckled like that. And now I think I should just get out of here.
I'm about to revolutionize the scaring industry.
when I do, even the great James P. Sullivan it's gonna be working for me.
well, somebody's certainly been a busy bee.
first I need to know where the kid is, and you're gonna tell me.
I don't know anything.
Uh-hum, Sure.
I...I know.
I means I don't.
what's that?
wait.
come on. Wait, wait...
Oh. Come on.
no, no. Come on.
Hey, hey, hey. This thing is moving.
I don't like big moving things that are moving towards me.
no. Come on. Hey!
Randall!
say hello to the scream extractor.
hello.
come on. Where you going? We'll talk.
come on. We'll have a latte.
come on. We can talk about this.
what is that thing? What is that thing?
wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
no. Come on. Hey.
help. Help! help! help!
Oh, for...What did you do wrong this time?
I don't know. I calibrated the...
go check the machine.
there must be something wrong with the scream intake valve.
fungus? Fungus?
you like cars?
cuz I got a really nice car.
if you let me go, I'll give you a ride in the car.
please, Fungus.
I'm sorry, Wazowski, but Randall said I'm not allowed to fraternize with victims of his evil plot.
what happened?
Where's Wazowski?
where is he?
come on.
this is crazy. He's gonna kill us.
that could be contaminated.
we gotta get out of here now!
we could start a whole new life somewhere far away.
goodbye, Monsters, Inc.
goodbye, Mr. Waternoose.
no, Mike, wait.
Hey, what are you doing?
follow me. I have an idea.
no, no, no, no, no...
simulation terminated.
no, no, no, no, no.
what was that?
you're trying to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.
I was going for a snake slash ninja approach with a little hissing.
how many times do I have to tell you?
it's all about presence.
about how you enter the room.
Mr. Waternoose!
James, perfect timing.
no, no... sir.
you don't understand.
now, show these monsters how it's done.
I can't. I can't. Sir.
sir, you have to listen to me.
pay attention. Everyone
you're about to see the best in the business.
reset the simulator.
but. But... sir!
good night, sweetheart.
night, Mom.
Kitty!
no, Boo, no, no!
give us a big loud roar.
Mr. Waternoose, there's no time for this!
come on. Come on. What are you waiting for?
roar.
but, sir...
roar!
well done.
well done, James.
boo?
all right, gentlemen.
I hope you've learned a lesson today.
boo.
boo.
boo, it's me.
the child!
sir, she isn't toxic.
I kown it sounds crazy, but trust me.
boo?
no, no... it's OK.
I was just...
no, no, no...
don't be scared. That wasn't real.
it's just a...
I was just...
boo.
and he gonna test it out on that sweet little girl.
Boo?...have her, he is trying to kill us.
this whole thing is Randall's fault.
Randall?
Yes.
and we can take you to his secret lab which is right here in this factory.
how could this happen?
how could this happen?
does anyone else know about this?
no, sir.
good.
this company can't afford any more bad publicity.
now, before we do anything else, let's take care of the child.
Oh. I never thought things would come to this.
not in my factory.
I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this.
especially you, James.
but now we can set everything straight again.
for the good of the company.
sir?
that's not her door.
I know,
I know.
it's yours.
No!
Boo!
No! No! No!
it's too late.
we're banished, genius!
we're in the human world.
Oh. What a great idea, going to your old pal Waternoose.
too bad he was in on the whole thing.
all you had to do was listen to me.
just once!
but you didn't, did you?
you're still not listening!
take that!
welcome to the Himalayas.
abominable.
can you believe that?
do I look abominable to you?
Hey. Why can't they call me the Adorable Snowman or the Agreeable Snowman.
for crying out loud?
I'm a nice guy.
snow cone?
no, no, no, don't worry.
it's lemon.
yea... How about you, big fella?
snow cone?
did you see the way she looked at me?
Hey, poor guy.
I understand.
it ain't easy being banished.
take my buddy, Bigfoot.
when he was banished, he fashioned an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.
wore it on his head like a tiara.
called himself King Itchy.
it won't be so hard for you guys though. You know.
I mean. How lucky can you get?
banished with your best friend.
he is not my friend.
Oh. I just assumed you were buddies, you know.
when I saw you in the snow hugging.
look at that big jerk.
ruined my life. And for what?
a stupid kid!
because of you,I am now stuck in this frozen wasteland.
wasteland?
I think you mean wonderland.
I mean. How about all this fabulous snow. Hum?
Oh. And wait till you see the local village.
cutest thing in the world.
I haven't mentioned the free yaks' milk.
what did you say?
yaks' milk.
milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic.
you know. Once you pick the hairs out it's nutritious.
no, no. Something about a village.
where? Are there kids in it?
kids?
sure.
tough kids, sissy kids, kids who climb on rocks.
##Where is it?@@##It's my eggs.
it's at the bottom of the mountain.
around three-day hike.
Oh. Three days?
we need to get there now.
you wanna go to the village?
OK.
rule number one out here, always...
no.
never go out in a blizzard.
we need to get to Boo.
boo?
what about us?
ever since the kid came in, you've ignored everything I've said, and now look where we are!
we were about to break the record, Sulley.
we would have had it made.
none of that matters now.
none of it matters? Wait a second.
none of it matters?
OK. Exactly.
no, good. Great.
so now the truth comes out, doesn't it?
Oh. Would you look at that?
we're out of snow cones.
let me just go outside and make some more.
Sulley, what about everything we ever worked for?
does that matter? Uh?
what about Celia?
I am never...never gonna see her again.
doesn't that matter?
and what about me?
I'm your pal. I'm your best friend.
don't I matter?
I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
but Boo's in trouble.
I think there might be a way to save her, if we can just get...
we.
whoa.
we?
no.
there's no "we" this time, pal.
if... if you want to go out there and freeze to death, you be my guest.
because you're on your own.
Hey, I got more snow cones!
Oh. Come on, now, George.
I know you can do this.
I picked out an easy door for you.
in Nepal.
nice, quiet Nepal.
you know, you're right.
here. Take this.
go get 'em, Georgie.
game will. Look out. Coming through.
sorry, George.
what...
Hey, you can't just...
Twenty-three-Nine.
out of the way!
finally.
I never should have trusted you with this.
because of you, I had to banish my top scarer.
yea. With this machine, we won't need scarers.
beside, Sullivan got what he deserved.
Sullivan was twice the scarer you will ever be.
Kitty!
Kitty!
Sullivan?
Kitty!
sorry, Boo.
Randall, stop him!
I want to get you home.
finish him off!
you don't know how long I've wanted to do that, Sullivan.
Mike?
look, It's not that I don't care.
Mike, you don't understand.
Yes, I do.
I was just mad, that's all.
I needed some time to think, but you shouldn't have left me out there.
I... I'm being attacked.
no. I'm not attacking you.
what? I'm trying to be honest. Just hear me out.
look. You and I are a team.
nothing is more important than our friendship.
I know. Kidy! He's too sensitive.
come on, pal.
if you start crying, I'm gonna cry.
and I'll never get through this.
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, but I am now.
Hey. Sulley, I am baring my soul here.
the least you can do is pay attention.
Hey. Look at that. It's Randall.
come on.
get up. There can't be any witnesses.
there won't be.
I'm glad you came back, Mike.
somebody's gotta take care of you, you big hairball.
Schmoopsie-pooh, I really can't talk.
come on.
Michael, if you don't tell me what's going on right now, we are through! You hear me?
through!
here's the truth.
you know the kid that they're looking for?
Sulley let her in.
we tried to send her back, but Waternoose had this secret plot, and now Randall's right behind us, and trying to kill us!
you expect me to believe that pack of lies?
Mike Wazowski!
Mike Wazowski.
I love you, schmoopsie-pooh!
Hey!
idiots.
look out. Coming through. Coming through.
make way. Move it.
hurry up, hurry up.
there they are.
attention, employees.
Randall Boggs has just broken the all-time scare record.
no, I didn't.
get out of my way.
go get 'em, googly bear.
there it is.
get off my tail.
let me go.
Sulley, what are you doing?
grab on, Mike.
are you out of your mind?
Sulley, what are we doing?
we have to get Boo's door and find a station.
what a plan.
simple, yet insane.
whoa.
Oh, boy.
hold on!
don't look down!
I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, no.
No!
Boo's door.
there it is.
how are we supposed to get to it now?
Oh. It's a dead end, Sulley.
there he is.
make her laugh.
what? Sulley!
just do it!
get it open.
here he comes.
give me that kid.
why couldn't we get banished here?
come on. We gotta find another door.
look! Boo's door.
there he is. Hurry up!
give me your hand.
come on, it slides. Just slides.
Oh. Right. Right. Right.
jump. I'm right behind you.
come on.
hurry up. Keep moving!
get inside.
that was weird.
Mike?
Oh. Sorry, buddy.
OK.
I hope that hurt, lizard boy.
great job, buddy. We lost him.
Boo! Boo!
No!
nice working with you.
get it open!
I'm trying!
open the door!
come on, get in here.
Boo!
there they are!
Sulley, what are you doing?
Sulley!
looks like we caught the express.
do you see them?
straight ahead.
Kitty.
boo.
look at everybody's favorite scarer now.
you stupid, pathetic waste.
you've been number one for too long, Sullivan.
now your time is up.
and don't worry.
I'll take good care of the kid.
No!
she's not scared of you anymore.
looks like you're out of a job.
all right, Come on. over the plate.
let's see the old stuff.
come on, now. Chuck him, Chuck him, baby.
come, baby. Come, baby.
here's the pitch, and he is out of here.
mama, another gator got in the house.
another gator?
give me that shovel. There!
get him, Mama. Get that gator.
care to do the honors, Mike?
with pleasure.
that's right, Boo. You did it.
you beat him.
come on.
OK, Boo, it's time to go home.
take care of yourself, and be a good girl, OK?
Oh, no.
the power's out. Make her laugh.
all right. I got a move here, that' ll bring down the house.
no, sorry. She didn't see that.
what?
what, did you forget to check if her hood was up, you big dope?
uncle Mike, try not to yell in front of her.
you know we need her to laugh.
right.
Hey, Boo. Just kidding. Look.
funny, right? See, with the...These are the jokes, kid.
what's happening?
hold on.
when the door lands in the station, cut the power.
you'll have the child, and the criminals responsible for this whole mess.
great. A welcoming committee.
what are we gonna do?
this is the CDA.
come out slowly with the child in plain sight.
OK, OK, you got us.
here we are.
here's the kid.
I'll cooperate.
but before you take us away, I have one thing to say.
catch.
2319. 2319. 2319
we have a toxic projectile.
what is happening? Hold!
after the suspect.
stop him!
come on.
don't let them get away.
what?
no. Wait, wait. Come back.
he has the child.
Sullivan. Sullivan!
give me the child.
give her to me!
open this door. Open this door!
Sullivan.
don't do it.
come on.
don't go in that room.
I think we stopped him, Boo.
you're safe now.
you be a good girl, OK?
this has gone far enough, James.
she's home now. Just leave her alone.
I can't do that. She's seen too much.
you both have.
it doesn't have to be this way.
I have no choice.
times have changed.
scaring isn't enough anymore.
but kidnapping?
I'll kidnap 1,000 children before I let the company die.
and I'll silence anyone who gets in my way!
No!
night, Mom.
night, sweetheart.
night, Mom.
what...what is this?
simulation terminated.
simulation terminated.
well, I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I spotted several big mistakes.
but, but... but how did... did...
you know what?
let's watch my favorite part again.
shall we?
I'll kidnap 1,000 children before I let this company die.
I'll kidnap 1, 000 children before I let this company die.
I'll kidnap 1, 000 children before I let this company die.
come with us.
what are you doing?
take your hands off.
you can't arrest me.
I hope you're happy, Sullivan.
you destroyed this company.
monsters, Incorporated is dead!
where will everyone get their scream?
the energy crisis will only get worse, because of you!
stay where you are.
number one wants to talk to you.
attention.
Hello, boys.
##Roz?@@##Roz?
two and a half years of undercover work were almost wasted when you intercepted that child, Mr. Sullivan.
of course, without your help, I never would have known that this went all the way up to Waternoose.
now, about the girl.
I just want to send her home.
very good.
bring me a door shredder.
what? You mean...You mean I can't see her again?
that's the way it has to be.
I'll give you five minutes.
well, so long, kid.
Mike Wazowski.
Yeah.
Oh. Boo.
it's been fun.
go ahead.
go grow up.
uh... But, Boo...
boo.
Oh. Look at that. You know...
Oh. That's cute. Yeah.
uh. Boo.
well, that's very nice.
come here, you!
Oh, he's a happy bear
nothing's coming out of your closet to scare you anymore, right?
Yeah.
goodbye, Boo.
Kitty.
Kitty has to go.
boo.
Kitty?
none of this ever happened, gentlemen.
and I don't want to see any paperwork on this.
take him away.
I bet we get the rest of the day off.
you idiot.
they're gonna shut down the factory.
I'm telling you, pal.
when that wall went up, you should have seen Waternoose's face.
I hope we get a copy of that tape.
are you all right?
come on, pal.
cheer up. We did it!
we got Boo home.
uh. Sure, we put the factory in the toilet and see, hundreds of people will be out of work.
not to mention the mob that will come after us when there's no power, but... Hey!
at least we had some laughs, right?
laughs.
is this thing on? Hello? Hello? Testing, testing.
Hey. Good evening. How are you? How are you?
nice to see you.
it's great to be here in your room.
where are you from?
never mind. You're in kindergarten, right?
I love kindergarten.
best three years of my life.
of my life.
but I love sports.
dodgeball was the best.
Oh-yeah, I was the fastest one out there.
of course, I was the ball.
but I was the ball, see.
all right.
Hey. Thanks a lot.
I'll be here all week.
remember to tip your waitresses.
great job, Mike.
you filled your quota on the first kid of the day.
not bad, hum?
you know. Only somebody with perfect comedic timing could produce this much energy in one shot.
yea. And the fact that laughter is ten times more powerful than scream had nothing to do with it.
Oh. Googly bear, come here, you.
schmoopsie-pooh!
googly.
girls, girls, put stop, stop, stop.
Michael, you're such a charmer.
Hey. Did you bring the magazine?
they just delivered a whole box.
let me see it!
Sulley and I made the cover, right?
I don't believe it!
googly bear.
I'm on the cover of a magazine!
this is great.
Hey, Sulley.
Ah... Hey, Mike.
I was...
listen. You got a minute.
there's something I want to show you.
OK. Close your eyes. Follow me.
come on. No peeking.
keep coming, keep coming, keep coming.
come on, keep coming.
Mike!
and follow the sultry sound of my voice.
OK, stop.
open 'em.
Mike, is that...
sorry it took so long, pal.
there was a lot of wood to go through.
it only works if you have every piece.
boo?
Kitty!
if I were a rich man
with a million or two
I'd live in a penthouse
in a room with a view
and if I were handsome
Oh. No way.
it could happen.
those dreams do come true
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have
wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have
wouldn't have nothing
can I tell you something?
for years I have envied
you were green with it.
your grace and your charm
everyone loves you, you know
Yes, I know, I know, I know
but I must admit it
big guy, you always come through
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
you and me together
that's how it always should be
one without the other don't mean nothing to me
nothing to me
Yeah, I wouldn't be nothing
no. Man.
if I didn't have you to serve
I'm just a punky little eyeball
and a funky optic nerve
Hey, I never told you this
sometimes I get a little blue
looks good on you.
but I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you...
let's dance.
look, Ma, I'm dancing!
would you let me lead?
look at that. It's true.
big guys are light on their feet.
don't you dare dip me.
don't you dare dip me, don't you dare dip me.
Ow. I should have stretched.
Yes, I wouldn't be nothing If I didn't have you
I know what you mean, Sulley.
because I wouldn't know where to go
me, too, because I Wouldn't know what to do.
why do you keep singing my part?
I don't have to say it
Ah, say it anyway.
cause we both know it's true
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have...
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have...
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you.
one more time.
it worked!
I don't have to say it
where' d everybody come from?
cause we both know it's true
let's take it home, big guy.
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have...
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have...
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
you, you
that means you, yeah.
Hey, I've been doing some homework on this kid Tobey Marshall from Mount Kisco.
this kid was a phenom. Used to tear up the local circuits.
him and his dad, man, they campaigned like champions.
of course, Mount Kisco had another great, Dino Brewster.
you all know Dino.
he went on to race in the big leagues at Indy and Tobey just kind of fell through the cracks.
well, here's some news, cretins.
Tobey's been running again, and running fast.
real fast, fast as that "Grim Taquito" will take him.
Tobey, you wanna fly with the eagles, you need bigger wings, son.
I'm just telling you right now that if Tobey Marshall ever got a car worthy of his talents, he could be toeing the line at De Leon.
give me four clicks of compression.
all right.
actually, make it three.
no, two. Two is perfect.
you wanna make up your mind? What is it, two, three, or four?
exactly. - Yo, guys!
you know I'm gonna hurt you, right?
two. - Thank you.
guys. Joe, you gotta check this out, man.
yo. - Monarch's on fire.
cretin, go ahead.
monarch, this is Darryl from East Orange.
why would you let a redneck trust fund baby into the De Leon?
he doesn't deserve to be in a winner-takes-all race with multi-million-dollar cars!
come on, Monarch! - Caller?
do I get to talk?
Darryl, have your parents ever smacked you upside the head?
see, this is a case where sometimes you just need to beat kids.
Darryl, Darryl, it's my show. I get...
shut up! Listen to me!
Darryl, one important question.
have you ever even driven a race car?
that's what I thought.
let me explain to all of you people out there how this works one more time.
it's my race.
it's the De Leon. I created it.
it's rarefied air, kids. It's beautiful.
I decide who gets in, and who does not get in to the race, okay?
I loved your dad.
he was a customer of the bank for 30 years.
thirty.
what y'all talking about?
the Flyin' Hawaiian just took down Steve Heavy Chevy - in the Arizona desert. - What?
an invitation as a wild card. Okay? That's important.
wild card. Maybe.
I'm not saying he's in, I'm saying he might be.
who was that?
he's just an old customer of my dad's.
I didn't recognize him.
Yeah, he might bring his car in on Friday.
what's wrong with it?
our job to find out.
I was thinking about the race tonight. We should get there early.
five cars, the race is full. Pot should be, like, what?
five grand.
Tobey. - Pete.
you good? - Good.
are you ready? - Yeah.
you know, Monarch gave you a shout-out.
then he shit on your car. - Yeah, I know. I heard.
never mind that.
while Monarch was talking about you, I had a vision.
all right, here we go.
quiet, okay? I happen to like his visions.
Pete, proceed, please.
I see water, and the sun, and...
your sister in a bikini. - Shut it.
I see Tobey looking at a lighthouse.
I see you, and you're gonna win De Leon.
Really? - Hey.
thanks for the vote of confidence, Petey, but I got my hands full trying to beat Jimmy Macintosh and you tonight, so...
Oh, man.
my sister and Dino are here.
she didn't tell me she was coming home, Tobe.
I'm sorry.
no, it's fine.
coming with Dino isn't.
what's this fool even doing back here, man?
maybe he just came to watch how a real racer drives.
the guy raced Indy.
it doesn't get more real than that, Finn.
let's go, Tobey. You don't need that distraction.
no, it's fine.
all right, boys, the race is gonna start soon.
Ben, you should head up.
I just wanna let you know I'm going because I want to and not because you told me to.
just know that. - Okay.
way to put your foot down, Benny.
nice pleather jacket, homie.
Hey. - Hi, guys. Hi, Petey.
how are you?
I'm good. How are you? - Good.
are you racing tonight? - Yeah.
you be careful. - Okay.
okay.
Hi, Tobey.
Anita.
I'm really sorry to hear about your dad.
did you get my flowers?
Yeah.
good.
and thank you for watching out for Pete.
he's like a little brother to me.
how's the shop?
the shop is... It's good.
it's good.
yeah?
how's the city?
it's different than I expected, but it's not here.
are you still allergic to Mount Kisco?
actually, Dino has something he wants to talk to you about.
I doubt that.
after the race, though. I don't wanna distract you.
then you should have stayed in Manhattan.
you look beautiful.
how are you feeling? - Good.
have you got the roads locked down?
the road is clear.
we are at the finish line and Benny is in the Cessna.
liar One, you standing by?
here we go with this again.
I wouldn't have to use that handle if you stopped telling people you flew Apache helicopters.
I took an Apache for a joyride, okay?
that's all I said.
I know that's what you said. We just don't believe you.
Hey, man, look, just because I'm a crew chief doesn't mean I don't know how to fly.
you gotta have balls of titanium alloy to do what I do.
so I need a little respect. A little R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
all right, enough messing around. What's the status,
liar One?
clear, and this is "Maverick.
call me Maverick, or I will kamikaze this into your nut sack.
mind if I watch?
okay, gentlemen, please be advised,
I got traffic ahead.
repeat, I got traffic ahead.
that was close. He got lucky.
it's not luck. He's patient.
sorry, little buddy.
my house!
Benny!
you bodied that guy's grocery cart.
what's wrong with you?
Yeah!
Yeah!
sweet!
Hey, yo, Father Joseph, make sure you save me a beer, buddy.
Hello?
that's what we do. That's right.
Benny, my man.
I thought you had him, brother.
Nah, I had him in the turns.
where were you? We missed you, brother, we missed you.
what do you mean?
I was flying, watching your butts.
you were flying? - Flying?
I didn't see him flying. - Y'all gonna play me like that?
I didn't see him flying. - Did you see him flying?
maybe you should ask the shopping cart guy if he saw you flying up there.
shots fired! Boom, boom!
so I'm supposed to watch out for cops, fly the plane, make sure you got a clear lane and look out for homeless people coming out of the shadows?
I didn't get that memo, I'm sorry.
nice driving.
I'm impressed.
Tobey Marshall.
the man to beat in Mount Kisco.
sorry about your old man.
I know you were close.
you lost, Dino?
what?
I mean, I haven't seen you around for a long time.
I figured, you know, you must be lost.
so, nothing has changed.
after 10 years, you wanna just pick up some locker room fight.
what do you want?
I wanna see you build a real car.
I got plenty of cars to build, Dino.
Yeah.
how's that going for you?
I didn't come to insult you.
I came to make a business proposition.
it could be a game-changer for you.
are you handing out dreams now, Dino?
I've seen a hundred custom racing shops since I left this town.
I still haven't seen work as good as yours.
that's these guys. Not me.
I have a very special car that needs to be finished.
what kind of car are we talking about?
ford Mustang.
a Mustang?
it's the one Ford and Carroll Shelby were building when Carroll died.
how did you get it?
Mr. Shelby and my uncle, they were close.
you finish building my Mustang like you rebuilt that Gran Torino,
I'll give you a quarter of what we get for the car.
a quarter?
the car is worth 2 million.
minimum.
that's $500, 000 in your pocket.
forget about the past, Tobey.
it's history.
I'm here to make peace.
and money.
don't answer me now.
just think about it.
I don't need to think about it.
I'll do it.
I'll get the car here tomorrow.
okay, I just wanna be the first to take the floor here and ask you...
have you lost your mind?
you're gonna have us work for Dino Brewster?
word?
what are you thinking, Tobey?
you don't wanna have anything to do with that piece of shit.
and, look, if this is about Anita, trying to get her back or something...
do it another way, homie.
write a poem or some shit. Okay?
I'll help you out.
dear Anita, Nothing is sweeter than Anita
I really aneeda... Anita
and I just came up with that just now.
just now!
yo, forget about that fool and his turtleneck.
all right? Just tell him you're out.
we're doing fine without him.
we're not.
okay. We're not doing fine.
look...
I'm behind on the loan.
that guy from earlier...
that guy is from the bank.
and he's just gonna keep coming back.
Tobey, if you say we need him, then I'm with you.
wait. We made five grand tonight.
it's gotta be enough to make the payment.
what about next month?
we'll figure it out.
we always do.
this time it's different, okay?
if you guys don't show up tomorrow to work on that car, we're gonna lose this place.
Hey, come on, guys.
this is Carroll Shelby.
this is an opportunity of a lifetime.
we're doing this. All right? For Tobey.
9: 30 tomorrow. Don't be late.
you're cheating, man. Quit cheating!
you just can't keep up.
shit!
here we go.
Yeah.
all right, all right, all right.
where is the rest of it?
we got a lot of work to do.
Yeah.
do you like that car over there?
Yeah, it's nice. - Yeah.
we built that.
so, you're a mechanic.
that was real smooth, Bro.
Hey. Do you like that car over there?
okay. Excuse me.
we built that.
we're mechanics.
we're not afraid to get our hands dirty.
do you know what I mean?
do you like that car over there?
how fast does it go?
fast.
very fast. Pete.
aren't all Mustangs fast?
well, this one was built by Ford and reimagined by Carroll Shelby, the greatest performance car builder in American history.
she's not from around here, Petey, so she probably has no idea who Carroll Shelby is.
but why is it so fast?
it's 900 horsepower, baby.
is that a lot?
are you kidding me? - Petey.
look, miss, this isn't the kind of car you can just go to the mall and buy.
trust me when I say, it's one of a kind.
can I see the engine?
sure.
5. 8 liter, aluminum block,
SVT supercharger and racing headers.
Yeah, it's quite nice, actually.
I wasn't expecting that.
nor was I.
Why?
because I'm a woman? Or because I'm from England?
Mr. Shelby's first Cobra was built using an AC body made in England.
it had a Ford 260 CID V8 engine.
of course, you already knew that.
life can be full of surprises.
I find life to be full of people who think they're smart because they have a fancy accent.
no offense.
some taken.
I really love Piers Morgan.
so, this is how it goes, is it?
you're very quiet, very tough, and then you're just constantly cracking these hilarious jokes.
Hey, Jules.
three million is way too much for this car, Dino.
well, that's what it costs.
let's see what Ingram thinks. - I am what Ingram thinks, and he thinks two at the most.
well, three is the number.
three is absurd. That's why nobody has bid on it.
that's the best car I've driven since Indy.
you haven't driven it, Dino. Tobey's had the keys the whole time.
do you want me to turn around and plug my ears while you all get on the same page?
what's the top speed?
180. - 230.
230?
he's talking about a theoretical top speed.
I know that you don't really talk, but maybe Mr. Strong and Silent could be a little less silent.
she'll go 230.
top NASCAR speed ever was 228.
this car is faster.
8: 00 a. m. tomorrow at Shepperton.
you get anything close to 230 out of this car,
Ingram is going to buy it on the spot.
for 3 million.
give or take a million.
mostly take.
good night, lads.
Bye.
230?
are you crazy? What if I can't get the car there?
well, maybe you can't, but I can.
I'll drive.
don't even think about driving that car.
Yeah, Tobey!
what are you guys doing?
stop! Stop!
what the hell are you doing?
you don't own this car! You don't get to joyride it!
top speed just over 230.
234
according to this.
Hey.
that was some driving, son.
it's going to cost me $3 million?
that's the price.
2. 7.
2. 7 million?
what the hell were you thinking?
we sold the car, Dino.
you never could've got that car to 230. Even on our track.
you think you're a better driver than me?
everyone knows he's a better driver.
you know, I'm just about done with you, Pete.
Hey! Back off, Dino.
I'll beat you on a track, the dirt, a road, anywhere else you wanna race.
Hey, you're the man, okay?
you're the pro.
you got nothing to prove to me. Let's move on.
no.
no, let's race.
if you win, I'll give you my 75% of the Mustang deal.
if you lose, you give me your 25%.
well, that makes it interesting.
this is the biggest house I've ever seen.
it's my uncle's place.
don't worry, he's in Monaco.
these aren't even legal in the United States.
they're all Euro-spec cars, so technically, they don't even exist here.
are they some kind of Ferrari?
koenigsegg Agera R.
top speed, 270 miles an hour.
but, Dino, I thought you didn't go faster than 180.
you got a big mouth for a fan.
Yeah, well, then let me race.
I'll be happy to have you, Pete.
awesome. I'm in. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. Sit this one out.
no. Let him be a big boy.
three identical Ageras.
after you.
the finish line is at the end of the bridge, over the 684.
the first car to get to the other side wins.
Tobey.
this is my vision.
this is how I saw you winning De Leon.
you beat Dino, take his car and win.
Wow.
Whoa!
Thanks, little buddy!
you got it, man!
Yeah, Pete.
come on!
we got him, Pete.
No!
no, no, no, no, no.
Pete!
No!
No!
fear not, for I am with you.
be not dismayed, for I am your God.
behold, all those who were incensed against you
shall be ashamed and disgraced.
they shall be nothing.
those who war against you shall be as nothing.
for I shall hold your right hand, saying to you,
fear not, I will help you."'
let's go through this again, Mr. Marshall.
a couple witnesses say they may have seen three cars, but we can't find the third car.
why don't you use that diagram there to show us where you claim the third car to have been.
my car was about two car lengths ahead.
this is where Pete was, and Dino was right behind him.
he tapped his back bumper hard, and at an angle.
Dino has two witnesses who say they were with him the whole day.
and the owner of Brewster Motors reported two Koenigseggs stolen last week.
just seven minutes before police arrived at the scene of the crash.
that's his uncle, okay?
they're lying.
all right? He was there.
Dino was there.
Mr. Marshall, you're the only one that can place Dino at the scene.
no way is this happening.
this isn't happening.
Pete... This isn't happening.
bill Ingram speaking. - Sign here.
Mr. Ingram, Tobey Marshall.
I need to borrow your Mustang to race De Leon.
excuse me, son?
you want to race my Mustang in De Leon?
what's in it for me?
when I win, I will give you half the cars.
that's around $4 million for you.
I'll think about it.
I'll call Julia.
all right. Step forward. Go. Everybody.
come on. Come to me.
that's my boy.
is Joe in?
already on the road with the Beast.
if this thing works, we're gonna need that head start.
what about Finn?
we haven't convinced him yet, but we will. It's Finn.
but more importantly, do we even have a vehicle?
I'll know in an hour.
Hey, thanks for dropping it off.
and thank Ingram for me, please.
so, what do you think?
first American car to win De Leon?
definitely.
you don't even have an invite.
monarch is gonna want this car in the race.
nobody knows where the race is until you get the invite, so exactly where would you be driving off to?
well, on the low, we know it's in California, we just don't know where.
and we also know that one of the drivers is...
Benny. - Okay, I'll shut up.
california is quite a big state and you might remember that I'm a numbers girl.
okay, so what are your numbers telling you?
there's a drivers' meeting the night before the race.
and that means you have 45 hours or less to get from New York to somewhere in California.
and your problem is...
we better get going.
it's 45 hours and counting.
whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, wait, wait!
you're not going anywhere.
you need a right-seater.
and Ingram is not going to leave this car in the hands of an ex-con who is about to leave the state and break parole.
44 hours and 59 minutes left.
let's go.
okay.
maybe we can just ditch her at a gas station or something.
Hey, man. Look, you want her gone?
I'll broom her ass out. Okay?
just follow me, dude. I'll have you driving like a bat out of hell.
she'll be screaming to get out of this car.
she's just crazy, you know?
she talks too much.
okay, so you've never been a right-seater.
well, if you see something I'm doing wrong, just point it out.
first of all, you're wearing high heels.
we just call them heels.
but if it's a real problem, then I can always...
I've got a change of shoes in my overnight bag.
Yep, okay.
so, is there anything else.
that right-seaters are supposed to do?
be quiet.
Hello, Beauty. This is Maverick speaking, the most awesome pilot in the universe.
just wanted to give you a heads-up and tell you about a little stop-and-go traffic up ahead.
nothing too serious.
we got traffic up ahead. We're gonna need to reroute.
I don't see any traffic.
well, Benny does, and he sees everything.
all right. Now, give me a dollar on the next exit.
what's a dollar?
hard right for lane three.
in three, two, - one. - Uh, no.
now.
you're looking a little filthy down there, Beauty.
it's time to get you clean. - What?
hard left U in three, two, one.
Oh, my God!
go three...
now.
you are moving, baby!
you do at least see the SUV that we are about to slam into?
you meant that one? The green one?
Tobey!
you see the bus, right? - What's that?
the bus!
the bus! The bus! The bus!
go two, now.
looks like a scene out of Speed down there.
hard left in three, Keanu.
you mean that bus, bus, bus.
just so you know, your friend Benny sucks.
hard left in one.
my man!
you got some skills, boy. You know you bad.
you know you bad!
beauty, it looks to me like you're all clear from here, my friend.
that's right.
I'm just gonna keep doing my thing, and...
# fly like an eagle, to the sea. #
# Fly like an eagle. Let my spirit carry me. #
# Go on and fly! #
you know, I get that driving fast is going to be necessary, but driving like a complete maniac in order to scare me out of the car is not going to work.
are you sure about that?
is that what you think?
whatever you think about me,
I'm sure it's wrong.
educate me.
so you think just because
I make a living buying cars designed to triple the speed limit, and because I drive a Maserati, and by the way, I'm an awesome driver, that you have the right to condescend to me?
well, this is going to be the longest 44 hours and 11 minutes of your life.
I'm not trying to be an asshole.
you don't have to try that hard.
the sound of a guy called the Monarch who hosts a secret race is hard to believe.
he's supposedly from an old wealthy family that made their money in the Industrial Revolution.
and no one knows who he is? - No one.
legend is he sponsored a few Formula One teams but always campaigned under other names.
a man of mystery.
mystery and a bad heart.
he had a dalliance as a driver, but his heart stopped like a watch one day.
so he quit.
so what's the prize for this De Leon?
well, big risks come with big rewards.
maybe that's why I walked away with $6 million worth of cars.
that sounds like a good day's work. - Yes, it was.
look, I don't mean to push you, but I have another interested party.
I'm not 100% sure about them. You know that feeling?
I liked what I saw at your dealership.
the problem I have is, you haven't shown a hard profit yet.
but I thought you said the dealership was in profits last year.
let me be blunt.
what do I have to do to get a real commitment from you?
I'll be blunt back. What's a real commitment?
five million.
okay, but you have to win this secret De Leon again.
and all those cars that come with it.
yo.
checking in.
mile marker 417. We're on schedule.
I was just sitting here thinking,
Pete would have loved this trip.
Yeah.
he loved the impossible, huh?
perfect for Petey.
Where's your head at, brother?
I'll never forget what I saw that day.
listen, don't you worry.
Dino's gonna get what's coming to him.
just don't forget why we're doing this.
I'll see you in Detroit, brother. Beast out.
I'm sorry about Pete.
he just left him there.
that's what I can't forgive.
that's what this is really about then, isn't it?
good morning.
dude, stop calling me, okay? We've already had this conversation.
just go to the window. - No.
Why?
just go to the window. Quit being a little bitch.
you're the bitch.
unit 4-Adam, report of noise complaint, Woodward circle.
vehicle description, silver Ford...
what the hell are you doing?
keeping the engine hot. - Unit 4 responding.
you're gonna attract attention to yourself.
shit.
is that your car, son?
no, no, no, no, no.
are you crazy? Do you know how expensive this car is?
why don't you just take it around the corner?
Hey, hey, did you see how fast I was going?
it must have been, like, 160 on that off-ramp.
you should drive this car. It's amazing!
officer, I am so sorry. - It's insane! Insane.
my boyfriend was showing off. He's trying to impress me.
why don't we just take it around the block? Now.
Boyfriend"?
I'm just trying to keep us out of jail.
well, you might wanna fix your hair.
for my mug shot?
no.
because I'm about to make you famous.
Finn, are you there?
I'm here. - All right.
don't mind the cop. That's not the problem.
watch how the car leans as he pulls away.
that's our problem.
go, go!
in pursuit, modified Ford Mustang.
heading east on Woodward.
the car is loose.
Yeah, I know. Thank you for that.
if Tobey runs that setup in De Leon, he won't finish, let alone win.
he's in?
maybe.
look, we have a plan.
and what does that mean?
it means we know what we're doing. Get your ass down here, bitch.
Finn! Finn, you okay, buddy?
casual Friday.
Finn, man, what's up?
jacki.
I've always wanted to do that.
Yeah!
have a nice day, you miserable bastards.
Finn, call me!
my friend is running the fastest Mustang in the world at De Leon on Sunday and the setup is all wrong.
I'm in accounting.
don't you feel like you're dying inside?
Yes.
it's cold in here.
Where's the Beast?
what the hell?
where are your clothes? - Did you miss this?
no, I didn't miss it. Don't touch me, man.
stay away! We gotta go, let's go.
you missed me, didn't you?
no. Get off!
I've got the shaved bird. We're jumping in the Beast.
we're behind. We got 28 hours to get to Cali.
copy that.
good morning. - Oh, my God.
so, why the hell are you naked?
to make sure I'd never come back.
I'm sure you could've done that another way.
let's be clear, though, you're not wearing my underwear.
there's a helicopter in the middle of the street.
Hello?
WNKW with a question for Tobey Marshall.
on a scale from one to ten, how crazy hot is your passenger?
like my new wheels? Bitchin', right?
what happened to the Cessna?
flight restrictions in the city, man.
but it's all good. I borrowed my buddy's little bird.
let me get a hard right.
y'all lucky, I almost got my hands on that Apache from Great Lakes Army Air Base, but Colonel Gatins was sweating me hard.
here we go again.
not talking to you, Beast.
Roger that, Liar One.
Finn, you're back in the crew for all of 10 minutes and you're already up my skirt talking shit.
man, you're gonna rue the day you started calling me that.
what, did you all of a sudden go to college, fool?
Wow. What a really ignorant thing to say.
God, are you ignorant.
is it gonna be like this the entire way?
a reminder, the Motown Marathon races through town this weekend...
Romeo, stand by.
standing by.
but for today's traffic, we go live to Romeo in the Channel 10 traffic helicopter.
how are we looking, Romeo? - Cut to two.
bum
bum, bum, bum, bum!
is Romeo in the helicopter? What's going on?
bum, bum
looking good, Beth.
real good.
commercial! Hey, cut to commercial!
Hey, Liar One, eyes on the road.
Wow!
I did not see that.
5-Charlie, I got ops on the silver Mustang.
I'm in pursuit. Westbound Jefferson.
copy, 7-Charlie.
we'll stop him before he gets on the 375.
all right, Beauty, this is gonna sound insane, but I need a two-lane grasshopper in order to get these guys off your back.
Roger. - What's a grasshopper?
you may wanna close your eyes for this.
is it worse than "Bus, bus, bus"?
all right. Now, just aim for the trees.
spread your wings, Beauty!
what just happened? You're amazing.
I can't believe we're alive.
okay, got to go. Time's up in the bird.
that was amazing. You're amazing.
we are amazing.
all units, please be advised, silver Mustang last seen on 375.
need to contact State for air support.
state dispatch status on Arrow One.
needed for immediate officer assistance.
suspect believed to be heading westbound on 94.
arrow One en route. ETA is in five.
liar One, are you tracking that air bear heading to I-94?
if he spots me, it's game over. We're gonna need to switch to plan B.
plan B adds an hour to the trip.
no choice, we're gonna have to make up that time.
Roger that. Plan B it is.
beauty will go bingo on that route, so we're gonna have to hot fuel and top off.
hot fuel, coming up!
get out there, skinny boy.
you were checking me out!
what?
Bingo" and "hot fuel..."
we're refueling without stopping.
so why don't you just say that?
well, I mean, I guess I could, but...
what are you doing?
helping.
what?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
shit!
steady!
closer!
Yeah! - All right!
I got this!
go inside!
the hits just keep on coming with you, huh?
never judge a girl by her Gucci boots.
her what?
high heels.
why don't you just say that?
nice.
Hey, Beast, take the shoulder, I'll go with you.
Roger that, Beauty.
all units be advised, we're on the lookout for a silver Mustang,
Adam-David-Tom 4-6-1-9, heading westbound on 94.
arrow One, 10-4?
I need eyes on that bear in the air, Liar One.
what's your 20?
still on the ground, Beauty.
come on, Susan.
don't let me down, baby. Come on...
Yeah!
that's my girl.
arrow. ETA in one.
you're good!
we're clear.
Yeah, yeah!
Thanks, boys!
beauty is a redneck.
Roger that. Beast loves a redneck.
Yeah!
dispatch, this is Arrow One. 10-97 in the area.
no visual at this time.
bear in the air is fangs-out down I-94.
beauty, you are safe and sound.
Redneck"? So, we're heading south.
all units be advised,
ford Mustang, New York plate Adam-David-Tom 4-6-1-9, last seen headed westbound on 94.
possible named suspect.
Tobey Marshall, wanted on parole violation and GTA.
passenger described as a blonde, white female, identity still unknown.
it was just a matter of time.
Yeah, well, you sped it up with your little stunt in Detroit.
it had to be done.
to get Finn?
no, not just that.
kids, I'm looking at something that I can't quite believe.
I mean, my inbox is white hot.
I got a bunch of trolls sending me footage of something that is mind-blowing.
I'm looking at footage of a car that supposedly disappeared.
that's the same car that Ford and Shelby were building when Carroll died.
I'm looking at a gorgeous ghost.
and I think that's Tobey Marshall inside there, driving a chariot of the gods.
so I bow down to Tobey Marshall.
Dino Brewster is on the line right now. Dino!
Dino, Dino bambino in San Francisco.
you need to see what I'm looking at.
I'm looking at some aerial footage of Tobey Marshall flying across the country with the cops in tow, in a phantom Ford that will make your bowels loose.
Tobey Marshall doing something stupid and reckless again?
didn't that guy just get out of prison for manslaughter?
Whoa! Dino, Dino, bambino. Hey, accidents happen in racing. 857
nobody knows that better than you, Dino, remember?
I just don't wanna see him race at De Leon.
you know, in fact,
I'm willing to give up my...
I'm willing to give up my Elemento.
to anyone that puts a stop to Tobey Marshall.
wait a minute.
wait a minute, did you just say what I think you said?
that car is one of three in the world.
you're willing to give away your Lamborghini to stop Tobey Marshall?
Yes, I am. And I'm gonna post some pictures online so everybody knows exactly what they're looking for.
this is too good.
I got star-crossed lovers hauling ass across the country.
I got Dino Brewster, who just painted a huge bull's-eye on their ass.
man. Christmas came early, wing nuts.
the thing you gotta understand is, racing is an art.
douchebag is out here, he wants to talk to you.
racing with passion...
dude, that's high art.
man, I can feel love and vengeance and smell motor oil all swirling together out there.
we got supernatural Mustangs, we got personal vendettas.
I have no idea where this is going. I just know I like it. I like it a lot!
call in, defend yourself.
everyone knows my story.
go ahead.
monarch, this is the blonde female sitting right next to Tobey Marshall.
Really? Okay.
we got a girl with a fake British accent, claiming she's sitting next to Tobey Marshall.
having a spot of tea, are you, dove?
there were three cars in the race the day that Pete died, that's a fact.
and anyone that says that Tobey is responsible for Pete's death, answer this.
why jump parole in New York knowing that you are going to be re-arrested and do serious time, unless you are innocent and hell-bent to right a wrong?
he did the time, he paid the debts, why would he risk it?
next time you talk to Dino, you can ask him that question.
thank you.
you're welcome.
I like this girl.
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, the British are coming. I gotta tell you, I'm moved. I am.
the whole thing just went right here to the old ticker.
I gotta pop one of these.
Yeah.
this is getting good.
I believe you, you crazy little tart.
Tobey Marshall versus Dino Brewster.
Yeah. I hear you, honey. I hear you.
the two of you out there, flying across the country at killer speeds to prove something while you're tearing up the American asphalt.
born to run, baby. Born to run.
Tobey Marshall, welcome to the De Leon.
that's it, cretins,
de Leon is full.
but if you want Dino Brewster's Lamborghini, you're gonna have to chase down that Mustang to get it.
Wow.
the race before the race.
I love it.
beauty!
congrats on the wild card to the rodeo, my friend.
your route is clear to the Nebraska border.
darkness is upon us, so the eyes in the sky will be shut for a while.
but I'm gonna leapfrog ahead and meet you guys at Record Breaker.
what's your 20, Liar One?
Flat-hatting you, bitch!
special delivery.
I hope you ladies didn't soil your panties down there.
I hate it when he does that!
that's what I thought. Keep talking that shit.
nice to see you haven't changed, nimrod.
okay, listen. I don't know who "nimrod" is, but I'm pretty sure he lived in the '50s.
all right? My handle is Maverick.
you better ask somebody.
Hey, make it fast, we're two hours behind schedule.
okay, I got this.
large coffee, please.
cream and sugar? - No, just black.
Yeah. I can't talk. I know.
excuse me, miss. Can I ask you a few questions?
why, of course you can,
officer Lejeune.
how can I help you?
do you live in the area?
no, sir. We're actually just long hauling.
where from?
from south to north.
so we actually started in Louisiana.
so you are not traveling in that silver Mustang out front?
Mustang?
what, like the horse?
no, sir. No.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
if you'd step out to my cruiser, shouldn't take but a minute.
stop!
stop right there!
Tobey? He's following me.
I know. Where are you?
I'm upstairs. I'm in a room.
all right, is there a window?
it's on the second floor.
open up this door!
look, just climb out the window. I'll come get you.
okay.
I'm gonna tell you one more time, open up this door!
any units in the area? Over.
ma'am, other units are on their way.
where are you?
Hey, you gotta jump. Let's go.
no, I can't jump. I'm afraid of heights.
it's not high. Come on.
no, I can't. I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know what to do! - Just trust me. Sit down.
okay? Sit down.
just close your eyes and count to three.
all right? On three.
one, two...
unit 445, there are no other units available at this time.
copy that. In pursuit of the silver Mustang.
where is he?
he's not coming.
are you sure?
trust me.
Hey, you know...
that was really impressive back there.
I just thought you should know.
Hey, do you think you could drive for a few hours?
let's just... Let's switch.
it's all right.
okay, steady.
there you go.
all right, don't kill us.
that's nice.
have you got her?
Yeah. - All right.
good.
good, good, good.
Jesus!
that was on purpose.
Yeah, thanks to Dino's bounty.
they're coming at you.
copy that.
wait, wait. See? They're trying to trap us.
here, just drift onto the shoulder.
no, no, no, I'm going for the Hummer.
he's a pavement prowler.
pavement what?
it's a show car with a big lift kit.
it makes up for his inferiority complex.
wait. Are you crazy?
wait, wait! Whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Jesus!
you are crazy!
nice. Nice, nice.
no, keep it straight!
holy shit.
okay, Larry, bring it.
got it. We're moving out.
shoot the tires, but don't kill them.
all right. Now, when I say, you're gonna let up on the gas and you're gonna make a hard left.
okay? - Okay.
okay! - Okay.
your instincts are gonna say...
just do it!
now!
don't let up.
blast those buggers. We'll get them on the split.
Hey, Liar One, you got your ears on?
son of a bitch!
we need to find another road.
liar One, we need you!
you gotta go faster.
no, two hands on the wheel!
shit!
liar One, is that you?
hook up, hook up!
sergeant Jackson, this is not what we discussed.
sir, will you relax? Okay?
I got this.
we're good!
you gotta tell me you believe I can fly an Apache helicopter, man.
what? - I'm serious, Bro.
you're always trying to play me.
tell me you believe I can fly an Apache helicopter.
tell him whatever he wants!
Yeah, you can fly an Apache helicopter!
and my handle is Maverick.
gotta call me Maverick, let me hear it.
maverick! Maverick!
maverick!
was that so bad?
shit!
Benny!
holy shit!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Julia, hey!
look at me.
just breathe. Breathe.
good.
look into my eyes.
look into my eyes. Good.
what color are they?
they're really blue.
they're really blue. Good, good.
they're a lot bluer than yours.
No! - Yes, they are.
they're not! - Yes!
they're not bluer!
admit it! - Mine are bluer!
Oh, God! - Wow.
Benny! Don't drop us!
what?
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
I'm kidding. We're good, we're good.
what the hell is that?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah, Tobey!
Hey, Benny!
we believe you, baby!
we believe you, Maverick!
look at me, bitches!
we're good!
Yeah!
go!
are you guys Okay?
Yeah.
major Davis, you are in violation of your flight plan.
my bad.
return that bird to base immediately.
looks like I'm gonna have to go away for a while, y'all.
but Benny always comes back.
Godspeed, boys. Godspeed.
you're 23 minutes late.
are you checking in, sir? - I'll be right back.
I'm surprised you made it.
I'm impressed.
what's going on in that head of yours, Tobey?
you never went back for him.
I wasn't there, remember?
I was there to comfort Anita at the funeral.
such a sweet, innocent girl.
do you wanna do this here?
because one of us is on parole.
but you know that, right?
we'll settle this behind the wheel.
I'm not worried about you behind the wheel.
Really?
why did you put a bounty on me?
tomorrow is gonna be fun.
Yeah.
when you're hanging upside down tomorrow,
I'm not coming back for you.
watch yourself, Tobey.
see you tomorrow.
you ran into him, didn't you?
you need to let it go.
I think you need to get out of the car.
and you need a hot shower, and you need a good meal, and some rest, and some food.
and I'm going to book you a hotel room.
no, I think it's best if you just stay with me tonight.
you know, it's just safer...
if you stay with me.
right? Yeah.
look at you. Okay.
beast, we've been hit.
all right, we're on our way. We're on our way.
track them. - I'm on it.
where is he?
he's up on California and Mason. Make a left.
are you okay?
go. Before the cops get here, go.
God!
I got you. I got you.
units, be advised, getting report of a vehicle roll-over.
115 Nob Hill.
unit 1-David responding. Code 3.
holy shit.
open the door. We gotta let them in.
we gotta make this quick. - All right.
yo, we gotta move. Cops are coming.
came in over the scanner. We gotta go!
come on, man.
we gotta go.
Tobey, you guys good?
we need a hospital.
find a hospital. Find a hospital. - I'm working on it.
all right, I got a hospital on Hill. Make a left.
wait! We need your help.
what's her name? Did she ever lose consciousness?
Julia. Yeah, she's been in and out.
you stay with her, all right? - I will.
take care of her. - Come on. We gotta go.
go, go, go. - We're here.
Anita, why don't you just leave him?
I just did.
I know that Dino was there the night my brother died.
Yeah. He was.
I wish I could give you those years back.
Anita,
I need a car.
I'm sorry, Tobey.
so am I.
why wouldn't he destroy it?
I have no idea.
I guess some people just don't think they'll ever get caught.
how is she?
arm is broke. Waiting on the CAT scan.
Hey.
how you feeling?
beat up.
but I'm fine.
you know...
you are not the girl I thought you were.
well, you learn a lot about a person when they've been hit by a truck.
what are you gonna do about tomorrow?
I found a car.
do I wanna know where you found the car?
no, you don't.
is it fast?
it's fast enough, yeah.
do it for Pete.
what?
this is for Pete.
Yeah.
this is, by far, the best De Leon I've ever put together.
this is my David, man. This is my Pieta.
this is my Soup Can.
is it possible to get a laptop?
sure. I'll be right back.
Hey, what's up, baby? What's your name?
right.
do you have an iPad I can borrow? Please?
we've got our lineup.
each driver takes his spot at the starting line.
in the first row is English Paul in a Bugatti Veyron and Dino Brewster in his Lamborghini Elemento.
row two is the Gooch in a Saleen S7.
Texas Mike is in the McLaren P1.
the third row has Johnny V in his GTA Spano.
I'm looking at $7 million in cars and thousands of horsepower. Winner takes all.
losers, y'all can walk home.
no sign of Tobey Marshall.
I don't really know what all that's about, but I...
hold up. Wait, hold on.
wait a minute, now.
a sixth car has just arrived, but I can't...
Tobey Marshall just stepped out of a red Agera.
well! Maybe the little tart was right about there being three Koenigseggs the day Pete died.
you like the car I brought? Because I know the cops will.
and by the way,
I think this belongs to you.
Tobey Marshall and Johnny V are battling for fifth.
you got it, you got it, you got it.
and Johnny V is off the road.
come on, come on, come on!
golden Gate, this is H1. I got ops on them.
westbound 128.
Tobey Marshall's gonna roll the dice and try to split the Saleen and the P1.
yo, yo, yo. - And he does it.
yo, that's my dude right there. That's my dude.
ladies and gentlemen... - Y'all come check this out.
Marshall's balls have just been located and they are very, very large.
Texas Mike in the McLaren is now fifth, Tobey is now running fourth.
Dino Brewster, you better watch your ass, son.
suspects approaching 150 miles per hour.
h1 will try to stall them.
all units, 10-3.
I've got flying cops. I've got flies in the ointment.
I got CHP in the air all over the course.
you add cops to the race and people get...
racers should race, cops should eat donuts.
all units, disregard the spike strips. They're moving too fast.
they'll get past the deployment spot.
let's try the rolling block instead.
18-4, roger?
18-2, six on Code 3.
rolling block in formation, check.
the Gooch in the Saleen has been totally taken out.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
british Paul holds first, Dino is still in second,
Tobey Marshall moves into third.
Yeah, boy.
all right, brother, keep it going.
dispatch, officers involved in TC. I need rescue, now.
all units, they TC'd into two of our officers.
be advised, five suspect vehicles are entering the tree line.
consider using lethal force.
they're at mile marker 27.
dispatch, confirm rescue is rolling. We have another officer down 18-5 in position.
suspects approaching on a five count.
18-5, countdown begins.
five, four, three, two, one.
18-5, perfect pit. Lead suspect down.
I'm hearing over scanners, the Bugatti has just got taken out.
man. Wait a minute...
wait a minute, Tobey Marshall has somehow just taken the lead.
Dino Brewster is running last in third place?
are you kidding me? - Hold that lead! Hold that lead!
and then there were three.
we need containment set at Navarro Bridge.
h1, Mendo PD is Code 3 to Navarro Bridge.
they're coming up to the race marker to the bridge.
Tobey is clearly running first. I can't believe it.
the blue collar kid from Mount Kisco is trying to wear Cinderella's slipper.
that's my dude! Mount Kisco, let's go!
by the way, these cop cars, they top out at about 130.
hold them back, baby! Hold them back.
good luck catching up, Smokey. I'll tell you who wins.
come on!
dispatch, another suspect is down.
only two remaining.
the Elemento just flicked the P1 into a roll.
we're down to Tobey Marshall and Dino Brewster.
this ain't just about racing.
don't do it. Tobey, don't let him do it.
Tobey Marshall just let the Elemento get by him.
nice move. - That kid better wake up.
wake up, Tobey!
wake up and smell that $2 million dollar Lambo in your pocket.
don't do it, brother. It's not worth it. You can beat him.
Pete... I need you, pal.
okay, let's go.
jeez, Dino took a swing and missed and flipped the Elemento.
Dino Brewster is out. Down goes Dino!
thank you, thank you, thank you!
Tobey is the last man standing! He's gonna win the De Leon!
he's gonna win the De Leon!
the Marshall kid from Mount Kisco! He's gonna make a milk run to victory!
that's right! That's my boy! That's my dude!
that's right. Give me space. I'm about to twerk it out.
Tobey is the last man standing!
get it. Hit it, hit it. - He's gonna win the De Leon!
I can't believe what I'm seeing!
the kid from Mount Kisco! The blue collar kid!
wait! Wait.
what are you doing?
what are you doing? - Why are you stopping?
come on. Come on.
come on.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm fine.
good. This is for Pete.
let me see your hands!
let me see your hands!
now!
stand up! Keep your hands where I can see them.
18-7, Euro plates Sam-Mary-Harry, 2-2-8, registered to a Dino Brewster.
well, now, hold on, cretins.
I'm hearing over the scanners that the Koenigsegg does indeed belong to Dino and that's the missing evidence that killed Pete.
well, then it looks like Dino, Dino bambino is going away for a long, long time.
well, kiddos, it looks like Tobey himself is gonna enjoy three hots and a cot in the pokey for illegal street racing.
I don't know, Tobey.
a few months in jail to prove your innocence.
was it worth it, kid?
all right. Step forward.
get in!
I'll drive.
I've seen you drive and it's terrifying.
come on, lovebirds.
we need to get Benny out of the clink.
maverick is getting out for good behavior.
Yeah, apparently he started some fitness program for the inmates or some shit.
we got five hours to get to Utah.
let's go.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right, baby.
you're rocking with the champ.
you're rocking with the champ. Number one.
don't even call me Maverick no more. Call me Benny the Champ.
that's right, baby. That's good, Jeff. I see you, Jeff.
what are you doing? What are you doing, Gerald?
Twerk!
you know what? You got a solo. Come on over here.
get it, Gerald! Get it, Bro!
that's what I'm talking about, Bro! Yes!
the FOREST WOMAN
I ain't got cholera , why you put me in here?
Hey! The loft's full of books. Take as many as you please.
quiet, darling!
Iorgovan! Iorgovan!
what's the matter, you're so pale?
you fell asleep and started to fret.
perhaps... You dreamt something.
with this scourge, everybody's having bad dreams.
drink this, it will do you good.
let's play!
here's the king!
I'll never play with you again. I'm crossed.
wake up!
last night...
there was a such full moon! Darling, couldn't wait to see you soon
but your mother made me sad When I heard her scold you bad!
my pretty darling, my love!
I left lonely like a dove!
l left lonely like a dove!
boys, let's drink this to... in fact, what's left to drink to?
to this meaningless life.
to the cholera! Perhaps it will be more merciful with us!
I'm going home.
to hell with this school, I'm going home.
you're running from the cholera? You're scared of it
no, brother. I don't know any more what I'm scared of.
truth is I can't stand it any more.
cholera, cholera! Can't you talk about something else?
if you don't die of cholera, then you die 'cos you didn't want to die of cholera.
his Majesty will see to it!
or you can die of fear.
and us? How about us?
how about this life one can't live anymore?
now it's the cholera, now the army, the war, or the emperor's decree.
I didn't know what fear meant until...
you're afraid? - Yes, I'm afraid!
Yes, I'm afraid! - Then I congratulate you.
this means you're a loyal citizen of the empire.
right, let's drink to fear.
or better to what we are not able to be.
sing, man!
Bravo, brother Iorgovan, bravo! Hop, hop.
don't let up, play it hard, it's how the Enlightened Emperor likes it.
well, I think you can't trample this Romanian nation under foot for ever
it can't be, historically, it's not logical,
not all real men in this land can be dead.
look, he drinks, stomps his feet, and is afraid. That's a real man, Bargaut.
he cries like a lunatic... Beats his drum and cries out...
good day, father.
welcome. What's the matter?
why so much hurry?
pa, I reckoned I'd better become a ploughman I'd have gone insane otherwise.
my humble respects, father.
for 5 years I kept you in 'em big schools of Arad, so you become a gentleman.
as if it was so simple!!
and now I wake up with you wanting to become a ploughman.
how is that? What did I and your mother command you?
father, I can't take it any more!
I'm fed up with being shut up in a room, confined to reading books.
arad teems with disease. A colleague of mine died of cholera.
cholera? - Yes.
can't be! Now with the harvesting coming, no way!
there's cholera in the country and Busuioc doesn't want to hear about it!
cholera at harvest time, that can't be!
I have 40 acres of wheat, and if I don't reap it in 3 days it sheds.
it's sheer madness!
the authorities stop people from coming to work.
they drummed up the news in the villages, they even said it in church.
nobody is allowed or to receive people from other parts to harvest.
where do they get the power to stop me from doing what I want in my own backyard?
Sofron is hitching the horses to the cart, to go pick up the people in the forests.
between hunger and cholera, they know what to heed more.
well, perhaps I should go, too...
OK.
better a foremost ploughman, than an ordinary squire.
we'll see about school. Now I have other things on my mind.
I put so much money in you for nothing?
you think we can erase it all? I've had enough, pa!
part dedicated to the Emperor, part to God, part to disease.
it's coming now. What is left for me?
my fortune, if you're man enough!
our family must stay where it has always been, at the top!
leave the boy alone, don't you see the long journey's tired him?
come with me, Iorgovan. When the scourge goes away, we'll see.
Hey, not so fast. Horses are God's creatures, too!
the prices we ask are so steep... Since with this cholera!
who are you looking for, master? - Nobody, nobody.
you happen to be from Zimbru?
Eactly. Don't you need harvesters?
master, master...
Ouch, he left the horses all foamy in the dead of the night.
come. What about the people?
they're here or not? - So and so!
speak properly, man. Did you or didn't you find them?
I did and I didn't.
they're afraid of cholera, they play hard to get. You ask for too much!
they won't stare death in the face.
I fear we can't get as many men as shepherd Busuioc says we need.
then let's take the horses and start off.
didn't you hear what I said?!
