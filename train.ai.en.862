she was about to take your head off.
there's no coming back from that one.
I'm gonna get the car.
if anyone survives,
I'll tell them...
I couldn't have done it without you.
well?
there was this kid on third street who said he can tell me how much your comics were worth.
I figured if you knew how much we'd get then maybe
where are they?
Where's my backpack?
it was a setup.
I got jacked -- oh!
my dad's medal was in that bag!
I'm sorry!
I'll get you a new one!
you gonna get me a new dad, too?
I'm sorry.
I don't care!
I hate you!
we're gonna get you all cleaned up.
and then I'm gonna call the police, and you're gonna tell them everything that happened.
come on.
we need to get it back.
Nana's calling the police.
I'm not talking about the police.
I'm talking about us.
we could get it back.
we have talked about this.
we need to be heroes.
like dad.
being a hero is what got your father killed.
the medal's gone.
I'm sorry.
you all packed, Maya?
you're not taking my sister with you.
I tried to let you go the easy way.
but you had to be persistent.
I'm taking my sister.
Hey.
I didn't hear you with the water running. Is everything okay?
I have to talk to you. - Yeah?
you were right. About everything.
about me. About Alejandro.
I never meant to come between you two.
I have to do what I can to protect him.
in time, he will understand.
of course he will.
and without you, I would still be somewhere in Mexico.
I just want to help you.
you have done that.
and so much more.
your mom said you were leaving tonight.
I've fallen 20 stories.
been stabbed in the head.
crashed a car at 70 miles an hour.
I've even been on fire.
but this hurts... more than any of that.
and it's not getting better.
I've always gotten better no matter what, but this just keeps getting worse.
I can't stand to see you hurt like this.
I won't be.
not for long. There's a man who used to work with my dad.
he has the ability to erase people's memories.
these are signals so that he knows to come.
he can make me forget I ever had a father.
are you gonna hang those in the window?
how do you know he's gonna see them?
I don't know, but I have to do something.
you don't want to forget your dad.
forgetting isn't the answer.
I just wish I could tell him how sorry I am.
why are you dressed like that?
I know what it's like to lose someone you love.
to wish that you had a piece of them, something solid to hold onto.
anybody tried to steal my mom's piano, I'd feed 'em their teeth.
look.
I know where those kids live.
the ones who stole your backpack.
you're gonna help me get back my dad's medal?
long as you stay out of the way.
anything crazy happens, I need you safe.
okay, I promise.
shh, we still gotta sneak you out. Come on.
it's as we'd hoped.
Claire's blood has fortified my antibodies.
they're strong enough to defeat the mutated virus now.
congratulations, doctor.
you promised Niki Sanders you'd find a cure, and you have.
and you promised me this company's viral research would end.
in working up this cure, I've been pouring over records that reveal the full extent of your program.
and you of all people should understand what it would mean to find a safe way to remove the abilities of dangerous individuals.
here, Strain 138.
if even the smallest amount were released, it would wipe out all of human civilization.
this strain is locked safely away in our facility in Texas.
and I can assure you, doctor, this company is vigilant about security.
Really?
for weeks I operated as a spy within your ranks undetected.
God knows what someone with experience and ill intent could achieve.
what can I do for you?
help me hunt down every strain of virus within this company and destroy them.
hello. - Niki? It's Mohinder Suresh.
are you still in New Orleans?
Yes.
I think I found the cure, Niki.
I'll bring to you on the next flight.
your nightmare's over.
I don't know what to say, doctor.
thank you.
there's no one home.
you should have plenty of time.
you know how to get up there yet?
almost.
got it.
I just wish it wasn't so bright.
I don't want people thinking I'm robbing the place.
okay.
how did you do that?
I told the lights I need them to be off for a while.
you told 'em. - Yeah.
what? You're St. Joan!
you really have to stop reading those comic books.
stay here. I'll be right back.
y'all put that gas in that van.
you figured out why they're paying us so much to torch all these buildings?
who cares?
as long as he comes with that cash, we come with the matches.
I'm sorry, dad.
I'm sorry I didn't listen.
I should've done everything you told me to.
if I hadn't been so selfish, you'd still be here.
I love you, dad.
we gotta better say good-bye. We gotta be in Salt Lake by morning. Come on.
this is all happening so fast.
I'm losing everything I care about.
what the hell are you doing here?
I came to watch the sunset.
liar!
watch who you're shoving, pompom.
Claire, don't.
this isn't fair.
welcome to life
come on Claire, we gotta go.
no mam, we don't.
you have no prove, no one could believe you.
you're probably right.
I guess something have to show.
I'll show what exactly what I can do.
you'll be the ones running.
hello. - Hello, Mohinder.
where are you?
I convinced the babysitter to take the night off.
don't worry.
I'm taking good care of the little one.
if you touch Molly
we won't want to wake her.
I brought someone to see you.
she needs your help.
we both do.
see you soon, Mohinder.
ando, wake up.
Hiro! You're back!
I know what Adam wants!
what is it? - A virus.
at a place called Primatech.
it's in Texas. Ando! Back in Odessa!
where we tried to save the cheerleader?
Yes!
Adam wants to release this virus!
if I don't stop him, they'll die!
who?
everyone!
but Adam is invincible.
how can you stop a man like that?
I must try.
I must avenge my father's death...
and save the world.
why is saving the world always your responsibility?
primatech Paper Co, Odessa, Texas.
this doesn't look like the sort of place where they'd store a virus that could destroy the world.
paper company's just a front.
the good stuff is three floors down.
laboratories, jail cells
Hiro? - Peter Petrelli?
what are you doing here?
Adam Monroe killed my father, and for that he must pay.
I can't let you do that.
then you have chosen the wrong side.
No!
I can't let you hurt him.
to be continued...
it's all happening so fast.
my life is a speeding train, and I'm not sure where it's headed.
but one thing is certain. I have been given a second chance.
touched by god.
and I've got to believe that he has a purpose for my life.
so why am I filled with self-doubt?
plagued by demons real and imaginary?
frightened by the challenges ahead, and haunted by the ghosts of my past?
does god know what I am? Do I?
am I an angel or a monster?
a hero or a villain?
and why can't I see the difference?
chapter FIVE "ANGELS AND MONSTERS"
did I startle you?
drink?
that's right. Because you're not really here, are you?
whatever makes you happy, Nathan.
you know what would make me happy?
some straight answers.
like how you knew she was in trouble.
you mean Tracy.
you said she needed my help, that she was my path.
next thing I know, she's taking a header into the Potomac.
and you were there to save her.
now I suppose you're wondering why.
I mean, was it luck?
was it coincidence?
or perhaps guidance from a higher power.
you're not a messenger from god.
moses saw a burning bush.
Mary heard the angel.
God came to Samuel in his dreams.
and I've got a dead mobster telling me he's the voice of god.
you think the answers to your questions are somehow outside of you, Nathan. But...
God resides within.
the answers will come.
who are you talking to?
nobody. Just clearing my head.
yo, what up?
what you need? - What do you got?
white lightning, base, angel dust.
no, I need something to take the edge off.
all right. I got just the thing.
I don't need your drugs.
I need you.
you have the hunger. You're just like me.
I will never let myself become you.
you already are. Brother.
No! I can't be you.
Peter, stop!
you don't know what you're-- you don't know what you're doing.
I know... exactly what I'm doing.
when were you gonna tell me that Sylar's my brother?
what other secrets are you hiding from me, mother?
tell me your secrets!
or I'll rip open your head and I'll take 'em out myself.
No!
are you okay?
is he gonna be all right?
Yes. I'll make sure of it.
we got a lead on a new target.
you want me to come with you.
don't make this harder than it already is.
Oh, god. Oh, god.
Sandra? - Crap.
what's going on? - Claire lied.
there was no cheerleading retreat. Now she's not answering her cell.
I'm so dang stupid.
she's obviously gone after one of them.
that's all she's been talking about, wanting to help, no thanks to you.
okay, calm down.
how can I be calm? Look at them. They're monsters.
Claire can't get hurt, remember?
Oh, no? How about this guy?
stephen Canfield. He creates vortexes.
makes people disappear forever.
even Claire.
all right, we'll find her.
Oh, no.
what is it, Meredith?
we just better hope it's not him.
Why? Who is he?
his name's Eric Doyle. He's a horrible man.
you don't even want to know.
no, his place isn't too far from here.
I'm gonna start by looking for her there.
I'm coming with you. - Sandra.
she's my daughter.
can you do this?
I'll have Claire home before you know it.
you think I wanted to leave my family?
I had no choice.
just tell me where they are.
you're her sister. Damn it, you know where she is.
I got the right to see her and my kids.
Hello?
is someone there?
behind you.
gotcha.
I need... your... help.
my help? You buried me alive.
why in bloody hell would I help you?
let me out of here!
you sawed off little Japanese cretin.
I will give you another chance if you behave. Okay?
okay.
we are searching for a formula that
formula? Heh!
I knew it would come back to bite them in the ass someday.
even I told them to destroy it.
so you know who would steal it?
maybe.
if I tell you, what's in it for me?
when we finish our mission, I promise to put you in a more spacious cell.
with a window. - And a vent.
forget it.
okay, back you go. - Wait!
you little Japanese Nazi!
let me think.
just off the top of my head, I'd say your villain is Angela Petrelli.
she asked us to find the formula.
I see.
well, I'm fresh out of ideas.
fine.
wait!
I know how to find your big villain.
and get you your formula.
I have a plan. - Na?
how do you feel about recruiting?
recruiting for what?
an organization for a new world order.
Daphne, you and I are standing on the precipice for real change.
a world where people like you are embraced.
your gifts acknowledged and respected, not ignored.
I mean, you'd like to be part of a world where you can really be somebody, wouldn't you?
as long as I get paid.
what do I have to do?
there are others like you out there.
just invite them to join us.
everything you need to know is right here.
these are some pretty nasty people.
I don't like getting my hands dirty.
they've merely lost their way.
it's time for us to give them purpose.
just... sit.
just so you know, this was her idea, not mine.
you mean my mother?
if it was up to me, I'd have left you to rot.
no forgiveness, is that it?
you terrorized my daughter.
you killed countless others, including a target that had valuable information.
rehabilitation doesn't happen overnight.
I am trying.
I understand.
killing is just in your nature.
what's going on? - What do you think?
I'm bringing you back to level five where you belong.
please, don't do this.
I need to find my family.
from the looks of things, they're long gone.
what do you expect?
your company dragged me away in the middle of the night.
I didn't even get to say good-bye.
they put me away for almost two years.
my family must think I abandoned them.
that's what happens to people like you.
they put you away so the rest of us can be safe.
I made one mistake.
you're like the others.
so quick to judge. You want to believe I'm a monster.
you killed someone.
you are a monster.
you're wrong.
and you need to listen.
Hey, there.
you didn't come home last night.
what's this?
a flyer.
it was stuck in your door.
did you know your neighbor was missing?
I'm getting closer, you know.
this next stage in my research, it could be the answer to taking away your ability.
I can make you happy, Maya.
I... should let you get back to it.
your company has got it all wrong.
I never meant to hurt anyone.
who's this? Your partner?
I don't have a partner.
what are you talking about? "One of us, one of them," right?
company policy.
you're not with the company, are you?
are you with them?
who the hell are you?
come in here and shoot me, hold me hostage.
you know about me.
I read your file.
you killed a man. - That was an accident!
your neighbor, right? Over what? A broken lawnmower?
we got into an argument.
it got heated. I overreacted.
next thing I knew, he was gone.
I didn't want to hurt him.
they locked me away.
no lawyer, no trial.
I love my wife.
I love my children.
I just want to see 'em again. Hold them.
even if it's for the last time.
I just want to be normal.
you don't understand.
now just--just go.
you're... letting me go?
Yeah.
just give me a head start before you call your friends at the company.
maybe I can help.
you tried to kill yourself.
how do I know you're not gonna do it again?
what do you want from me, Nathan?
undying gratitude?
Thanks. You're my hero.
I want to know what you were doing on that bridge.
I can't talk about it.
why not?
who's gonna understand better than I am?
just tell me. What happened?
I killed someone. - Who?
a reporter.
he threatened to run a story saying that I was Niki Sanders.
when there was no way that I could reason with him, I got-- I got angry.
I reached out to grab him...
froze him. He shattered.
it was an accident, Tracy.
I need to turn myself in.
that's probably not a good idea.
what are you gonna tell them, Tracy?
who's gonna believe you?
I can fly, but I can't talk about it.
well, then I'll show them. - You can't do that.
listen, I've been there. I understand.
I-I wanted to tell the world. I even called a press conference.
what happened?
I got shot. I died.
and then I saw god.
and I truly believe with all my heart that he's got a higher purpose for us.
you think god gave us these powers?
if he didn't, who did?
a doctor in Reseda, California.
this is the last number the company has for them.
it's the same area code, so they can't have gone far.
Thanks, Claire. For everything.
Hi, baby. It's me.
wait, don't hang up.
look, I know you're scared, but, uh, I love you.
I need to see you and the kids.
well, then meet me, anywhere.
the Griffith Park carousel.
great. Man, I can't wait-- Hello? Hello!
what happened?
we were cut off.
Claire? - Dad?
he's your father?
you set me up? - No, I swear.
back off! Drop the gun.
let go of the girl!
Sylar. Dad, what is he doing here?
let her go, Canfield. You don't stand a chance. - Stand back. Last warning.
I didn't know. I'm sorry. - It's not over yet.
hold on to something. - Stand back, I will shoot!
hold on, Claire.
Claire, hold on.
dad! Help!
dad, help!
Claire! Don't let go.
dad!
you okay? - Peachy.
Oh, thank god. You okay?
target's gone.
well, he can't be far.
Claire. Where did Mr. Canfield go?
leave him alone. He doesn't want to hurt anyone.
this isn't a game. He's very dangerous.
who are you to talk? Bringing him here?
tell me you're not working with him after what he did to me.
Claire, you hate me. I understand.
when I touched your hand, I could feel the pain that I caused you and I never meant for you.
shut your mouth now.
you don't get to talk to her. Ever.
look... we'll talk more about this when we get home, but right now you have to tell me where Mr. Canfield went.
he's not a killer.
he's having problems like I had problems.
he just--he didn't have you to help him.
all right. Okay, then just...
let me talk to him. If what you say is true, we'll make other arrangements.
you can trust me, Claire.
I wouldn't send anybody to level five that doesn't belong there.
he's at the Griffith Park carousel.
this is your plan?
go to a bar?
I haven't had a drink in months, and they make a mean appletini.
I'm warning you, Adam Monroe.
I'll pop you right back into your coffin.
relax.
you said the speedster girl was hired, right?
well, this bar is the go-to destination of specials for hire.
specials for hire?
that's right.
Ooh, like the cantina.
Yeah. I never knew there was such a place.
can we find out who hired the speedster?
hello.
that's why we're here.
just leave everything to me.
and try and...
look tough.
barkeep, the usual, and make it snappy.
Hello, milosh.
how dare you come in here?
look, I didn't know she was your wife.
and for the record, she never mentioned it.
what happened to Peter?
I put him in a medically induced coma.
what?
your brother tried to kill me.
Why?
he took Sylar's ability, and now he's suffering the consequences.
we're in a lot of trouble, Nathan.
mom, it's Tracy Strauss.
Tracy, my mom.
I know who she is.
and why she's come.
I heard you saw Dr. Zimmerman.
how do you know Dr. Zimmerman?
he worked for the company many years ago in research and development.
very bright.
then you understand what he did to me.
you can help me.
no, I'm afraid that's not possible.
his work was classified.
you want me to go public with this?
what are you hiding, mom?
zimmerman was instrumental in the company's development of synthetic abilities.
synthetic.
we used the technology on a number of infants.
you were one of them, Tracy.
as were your sisters, Niki and Barbara.
and you, Nathan.
we gave you your ability too.
God...
what have you done?
my...god!
I know you're in here.
you have to control your power.
you don't want to be a killer again, do you?
what have you done?
you're...
a monster.
I wish you hadn't said that.
it's done.
what do you want me to do about the two Japanese guys?
it's all here.
the testing, the experimentation.
everything they did to us.
it wasn't god.
we were trying to be better than god.
how?
by using people as...
lab rats?
your own son.
your father was disappointed that you weren't born with the genetic code.
but we thought because of your lineage, your system could handle it.
and obviously we were right.
then what about me?
my parents were dead.
I had no one to protect me.
Tracy, what this company did to you in the name of science was wrong.
we know that now.
and that is why we divided the formula and hid it so this would never happen again.
an innocent man is dead because of what you did to me.
then help me.
because someone has stolen the formula.
they want to restart this project.
they want to create a world filled with dangerous people.
deadly, out of control.
they will destroy everything.
please help me stop them.
go to hell.
Nathan, it's why Peter took Sylar's ability.
it's why--it's why he sacrificed himself.
he knows what's gonna happen to this world.
you do not understand.
I understand, ma.
I understand.
you locked Peter up.
put a shunt in his head.
you did experiments on me.
and god knows who else.
who else did you use as your own personal guinea pig?
Nathan, listen to me.
I'm sorry.
what's next?
I know a scientist.
he understands all of this genetic stuff.
if anybody can help you, he can.
can he be trusted?
Yeah, he's harmless.
it's Claire.
I talked to my dad.
he said he's willing to listen.
it doesn't matter anymore.
what happened?
they never showed up.
you were right, Claire.
my wife...
my kids...
they're afraid of me.
maybe I am a monster.
couldn't put it better.
dad, what are you doing?
it's all right.
we're just talking.
I'll make you a deal, Stephen.
my partner is standing right over there by my car.
you make him disappear, and this is all over.
I don't understand.
you want me to kill your partner?
do it, and I'll let you go.
I give you my word.
what are you saying?
you do not have to do this.
stay out of this, Claire.
she's right, I can't.
I'm not a killer.
maybe not.
but he is.
and he needs to be destroyed.
unfortunately, I can't do it.
please, I just - I'm not asking.
dad, no!
I'm doing this for us, Claire.
for what Sylar did to you.
you people...
you've taken everything from me.
do it.
kill him now!
what are you doing?
I won't be a monster. - No!
Hello, boys.
nemesis.
so...
my friend here tells me that you're looking for work.
and I said, that's not possible.
those goody two-shoes.
we heard about what you are doing.
sign us up.
I'm not convinced.
we have changed.
we are badasses now.
Yes, we are very badass.
when do we start?
not so fast.
you have to prove yourself worthy.
how do we do that?
you're the one with the powers?
Yes.
I control time and space.
cool.
kill the other one.
kill Ando?
Yeah, he has no powers.
what good is he to us?
you kill him, you are badass.
I'm sorry, my friend.
I must make some sacrifices...
to save the world.
Hiro.
we'll talk more when I come home, okay?
Claire, wait.
I know you're-- you're disappointed, but I did what I had to do...
for us.
she doesn't believe a word you're saying.
she knows exactly what you did back there, why didn't take down Stephen Canfield when you had the chance.
nobody's talking to you.
Claire finally sees you for what you are--a user.
isn't that right, Claire?
you used her to try to find that poor man.
then you used him to try to kill me because to you...
I'm nothing but a monster.
he doesn't see our humanity, Claire.
he never will.
Claire, wait.
you're not gonna listen to him, are you?
the man is a deranged sociopath.
he's a killer.
he's a monster.
Yes.
and you are my daughter.
and everything I do is to protect you.
to protect this family.
tell me you understand that.
I understand.
it's all gonna be okay.
I promise.
mom.
thank god.
I was so worried.
are you okay?
cause if you are, you are so grounded.
I'm sorry.
I'm just glad Meredith found you.
enjoying your dinner, my dear?
eat.
now...
give me a sweet kiss.
go to hell, you filthy
my god.
Peter, tell me you didn't do this, please.
Hello, Angela. - No...
it can't be.
you can see the future.
I can't have that.
it's too dangerous.
no, you won't succeed.
I'll stop you.
don't be ridiculous.
you won't even be able to move.
you won't even be able to move.
you're late.
have you completed your task?
they're onboard.
even the Japanese guy.
look, I'm not happy about what happened.
that's not what I signed up for.
I'm not a killer.
it's all part of making the world a better place, Daphne.
no pain, no gain.
there's another one you're going to have to recruit.
I'm afraid he's going to be the most difficult.
what's his thing?
he has the ability to alter your mind.
put thoughts into your head.
make you see things that aren't there.
speaking of which, I finally figured out what's been bugging me about you.
I'm fast.
real fast.
I can sneak up on everybody.
I can't sneak up on you.
I knew it!
you're not really there.
it's not your concern, Daphne.
just bring me Parkman.
guess I don't really have a choice, do I?
the team is coming together nicely.
everything went fine.
perfect with Nathan.
I messed with his head.
I gave him visions of Linderman, just like you asked.
now he thinks he's doing god's work.
Yes.
very real.
daphne is spreading the word.
we're building an army, just like you.
sorry.
Knox called just a few minutes ago.
he'll have Adam Monroe here by tomorrow.
right.
Absolutely.
whatever you say goes, Mr. Petrelli.
to BE CONTINUED...
it's all happening so fast.
my life is a speeding train, and I'm not sure where it's headed.
but one thing is certain. I have been given a second chance.
touched by god.
and I've got to believe that he has a purpose for my life.
so why am I filled with self-doubt?
plagued by demons real and imaginary?
frightened by the challenges ahead, and haunted by the ghosts of my past?
does god know what I am?
do I?
am I an angel or a monster?
a hero or a villain?
and why can't I see the difference?

no, I need something to take the edge off.
all right.
I got just the thing.
I don't need your drugs.
I need you.
you have the hunger.
you're just like me.
I will never let myself become you.
you already are.
brother.
No!
I can't be you.
Peter, stop!
you don't know what you're...
you don't know what you're doing.
I know...
exactly what I'm doing.
when were you gonna tell me that Sylar's my brother?
what other secrets are you hiding from me, mother?
tell me your secrets!
or I'll rip open your head and I'll take 'em out myself.
No!
are you okay?
is he gonna be all right?
Yes.
I'll make sure of it.
we got a lead on a new target.
you want me to come with you.
don't make this harder than it already is.
Oh, god. Oh, god.
crap.
what's going on? - Claire lied.
there was no cheerleading retreat. Now she's not answering her cell.
I'm so dang stupid.
she's obviously gone after one of them.
that's all she's been talking about, wanting to help, no thanks to you.
okay, calm down. - How can I be calm?
look at them. They're monsters.
Claire can't get hurt, remember?
Oh, no?
how about this guy?
he creates vortexes.
makes people disappear forever.
even Claire.
all right, we'll find her.
Oh, no.
what is it, Meredith?
we just better hope it's not him.
Why? Who is he?
his name's Eric Doyle. He's a horrible man.
you don't even want to know.
no, his place isn't too far from here. I'm gonna start by looking for her there.
I'm coming with you.
she's my daughter.
can you do this?
I'll have Claire home before you know it.
you think I wanted to leave my family?
I had no choice.
just tell me where they are.
you're her sister. Damn it, you know where she is.
I got the right to see her and my kids.
Hello?
is someone there?
behind you.
I need...your...help.
my help?
you buried me alive. Why in bloody hell would I help you?
let me out of here!
you sawed off little Japanese cretin.
I told you this was a bad idea.
Adam Monroe is a villain.
but he knows who the bad guy is.
we can't trust him.
he killed your father.
I know.
but a hero...must take risks and make sacrifices...to save the world.
I will give you another chance if you behave.
okay?
okay.
we are searching for a formula that...
formula? Heh!
I knew it would come back to bite them in the ass someday.
even I told them to destroy it.
so you know who would steal it?
maybe.
if I tell you, what's in it for me?
when we finish our mission, I promise to put you in a more spacious cell.
with a window.
and a vent.
forget it.
okay, back you go.
wait!
you little Japanese Nazi!
let me think.
just off the top of my head, I'd say your villain is Angela Petrelli.
she asked us to find the formula.
I see.
well, I'm fresh out of ideas.
fine.
wait!
I know how to find your big villain.
and get you your formula.
I have a plan.
na?
how do you feel about recruiting?
recruiting for what?
an organization for a new world order.
you and I are standing on the precipice for real change.
a world where people like you are embraced.
I mean, you'd like to be part of a world where you can really be somebody, wouldn't you?
as long as I get paid.
what do I have to do?
there are others like you out there. Just invite them to join us.
everything you need to know is right here.
these are some pretty nasty people.
I don't like getting my hands dirty.
they've merely lost their way.
it's time for us to give them purpose.
just...
sit.
just so you know, this was her idea, not mine.
you mean my mother?
if it was up to me, I'd have left you to rot.
no forgiveness, is that it?
you terrorized my daughter.
you killed countless others, including a target that had valuable information.
rehabilitation doesn't happen overnight.
I am trying.
I understand.
killing is just in your nature.
what's going on?
what do you think?
I'm bringing you back to level five where you belong.
please, don't do this.
I need to find my family.
from the looks of things, they're long gone.
what do you expect?
your company dragged me away in the middle of the night.
I didn't even get to say good-bye.
they put me away for almost two years. My family must think I abandoned them.
that's what happens to people like you.
they put you away so the rest of us can be safe.
I made one mistake.
you're like the others.
so quick to judge. Yyou want to believe I'm a monster.
you killed someone.
you are a monster.
you're wrong.
and you need to listen.
Hey, there.
you didn't come home last night.
what's this?
a flyer.
it was stuck in your door.
did you know your neighbor was missing?
I'm getting closer, you know.
this next stage in my research, it could be the answer to taking away your ability.
I can make you happy, Maya.
I...
should let you get back to it.
your company has got it all wrong.
I never meant to hurt anyone.
who's this? Your partner?
I don't have a partner.
what are you talking about?
one of us, one of them," right?
company policy.
you're not with the company, are you?
are you with them? PINEHEARST company who the hell are you?
come in here and shoot me, hold me hostage.
you know about me.
I read your file.
you killed a man. - That was an accident!
your neighbor, right?
over what? A broken lawnmower?
we got into an argument.
it got heated. I overreacted.
next thing I knew, he was gone.
I didn't want to hurt him.
they locked me away.
no lawyer, no trial.
I love my wife.
I love my children.
I just want to see 'em again.
hold them.
even if it's for the last time.
I just want to be normal.
you don't understand.
now just -- just go.
You're...letting me go?
Yeah.
just give me a head start before you call your friends at the company.
maybe I can help.
you tried to kill yourself.
how do I know you're not gonna do it again?
what do you want from me, Nathan?
undying gratitude?
Thanks.
you're my hero.
I want to know what you were doing on that bridge.
I can't talk about it.
why not?
who's gonna understand better than I am?
just tell me.
what happened?
I killed someone.
who?
a reporter.
he threatened to run a story saying that I was Niki Sanders.
when there was no way that I could reason with him, I got-- I got angry. I reached out to grab him...
froze him.
he shattered.
it was an accident, Tracy.
I need to turn myself in.
that's probably not a good idea.
what are you gonna tell them, Tracy?
who's gonna believe you?
I can fly, but I can't talk about it.
well, then I'll show them.
you can't do that.
listen, I've been there.
I understand. I - I wanted to tell the world.
I even called a press conference.
what happened?
I got shot.
I died.
and then I saw god.
and I truly believe with all my heart that he's got a higher purpose for us.
you think god gave us these powers?
if he didn't, who did?
a doctor in Reseda, California.
this is the last number the company has for them.
it's the same area code, so they can't have gone far.
Thanks, Claire.
for everything.
Hi, baby.
it's me.
wait, don't hang up.
look, I know you're scared, but, uh, I love you.
I need to see you and the kids.
well, then meet me, anywhere.
the Griffith park carousel.
great.
man, I can't wait...
Hello? Hello!
what happened?
we were cut off.
dad?
he's your father?
you set me up?
no, I swear.
back off! Drop the gun. Let go of the girl!
dad, what is he doing here?
let her go, Canfield.
you don't stand a chance. - stand back. Last warning.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.
it's not over yet.
hold on to something.
stand back, i will shoot!
hold on, Claire.
Claire, hold on.
dad!
help!
dad, help!
don't let go.
dad!
you OKAY?
peachy.
thank GOD. YOU OKAY?
target's GONE.
well, HE CAN'T BE FAR.
where DID MR. CANFIELD GO?
leave HIM ALONE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO HURT ANYONE.
this ISN'T A GAME. HE'S VERY DANGEROUS.
who ARE YOU TO TALK?
bringing HIM HERE?
tell ME YOU'RE NOT WORKING WITH HIM AFTER WHAT HE DID TO ME.
Claire, YOU HATE ME. I UNDERSTAND.
when I TOUCHED YOUR HAND,
I COULD FEEL THE PAIN THAT I CAUSED YOU,
and I NEVER MEANT FOR YOU...
shut YOUR MOUTH NOW.
you DON'T GET TO TALK TO HER.
ever.
look...
we'll TALK MORE ABOUT THIS WHEN WE GET HOME,
but RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME WHERE MR. CANFIELD WENT.
he's NOT A KILLER.
he's HAVING PROBLEMS LIKE I HAD PROBLEMS.
he JUST -- HE DIDN'T HAVE YOU TO HELP HIM.
all RIGHT.
okay, THEN JUST...
let ME TALK TO HIM. IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE,
we'll MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.
you CAN TRUST ME, CLAIRE.
I WOULDN'T SEND ANYBODY TO LEVEL FIVE THAT DOESN'T BELONG THERE.
he's AT THE GRIFFITH PARK CAROUSEL.
this IS YOUR PLAN? GO TO A BAR?
I HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK IN MONTHS,
and THEY MAKE A MEAN APPLETINI.
I'm WARNING YOU, ADAM MONROE.
I'll POP YOU RIGHT BACK INTO YOUR COFFIN.
relax.
you SAID THE SPEEDSTER GIRL WAS HIRED, RIGHT?
well, THIS BAR IS THE GO-TO DESTINATION OF SPECIALS FOR HIRE.
specials FOR HIRE? -THAT'S RIGHT.
Ooh, LIKE THE CANTINA.
I NEVER KNEW THERE WAS SUCH A PLACE.
can WE FIND OUT WHO HIRED THE SPEEDSTER?
hello.
that's WHY WE'RE HERE.
just LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME.
and TRY AND... LOOK TOUGH.
he said look tough. Not like Mr. Robot.
this is my tough guy walk.
barkeep, THE USUAL, AND MAKE IT SNAPPY.
Hello, MILOSH.
how DARE YOU COME IN HERE?
look, I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS YOUR WIFE.
and FOR THE RECORD, SHE NEVER MENTIONED IT.
Hiro, wake up!
he's getting away!
blink Hiro. Blink.
freeze time!
or Adam Monroe will be...
gone.
what HAPPENED TO PETER?
I PUT HIM IN A MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA.
what?
your BROTHER TRIED TO KILL ME.
Why?
he TOOK SYLAR'S ABILITY,
and NOW HE'S SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES.
we're IN A LOT OF TROUBLE, NATHAN.
mom, IT'S TRACY STRAUSS.
Tracy, MY MOM.
I KNOW WHO SHE IS. AND WHY SHE'S COME.
I HEARD YOU SAW DR. ZIMMERMAN.
how DO YOU KNOW DR. ZIMMERMAN?
he WORKED FOR THE COMPANY MANY YEARS AGO IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.
very BRIGHT.
then YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HE DID TO ME.
you CAN HELP ME.
no, I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
his WORK WAS CLASSIFIED.
you WANT ME TO GO PUBLIC WITH THIS?
what ARE YOU HIDING, MOM?
zimmerman WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE COMPANY'S DEVELOPMENT OF SYNTHETIC ABILITIES.
synthetic.
we USED THE TECHNOLOGY ON A NUMBER OF INFANTS.
you WERE ONE OF THEM, TRACY.
as WERE YOUR SISTERS, NIKI AND BARBARA.
and YOU, NATHAN.
we GAVE YOU YOUR ABILITY TOO.
God...
what HAVE YOU DONE?
OH...MY...GOD!
gotta GET YOU OUT.
I KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE.
you HAVE TO CONTROL YOUR POWER.
you DON'T WANT TO BE A KILLER AGAIN, DO YOU?
what HAVE YOU DONE?
YOU'RE...A MONSTER.
I WISH YOU HADN'T SAID THAT.
I searched everywhere.
Adam Monroe is gone.
look harder, he must be somewhere.
it's DONE.
what DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT THE TWO JAPANESE GUYS?
it's ALL HERE.
the TESTING, THE EXPERIMENTATION.
everything THEY DID TO US.
it WASN'T GOD.
we WERE TRYING TO BE BETTER THAN GOD.
how?
by USING PEOPLE AS ...LAB RATS?
your OWN SON.
your FATHER WAS DISAPPOINTED
that YOU WEREN'T BORN WITH THE GENETIC CODE.
but WE THOUGHT BECAUSE OF YOUR LINEAGE,
your SYSTEM COULD HANDLE IT.
and OBVIOUSLY WE WERE RIGHT.
then WHAT ABOUT ME?
my PARENTS WERE DEAD.
I HAD NO ONE TO PROTECT ME.
Tracy, WHAT THIS COMPANY DID TO YOU IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE WAS WRONG.
we KNOW THAT NOW.
and THAT IS WHY WE DIVIDED THE FORMULA,
and HID IT SO THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
an INNOCENT MAN IS DEAD BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID TO ME.
then HELP ME.
because SOMEONE HAS STOLEN THE FORMULA.
they WANT TO RESTART THIS PROJECT.
they WANT TO CREATE A WORLD FILLED WITH DANGEROUS PEOPLE.
deadly, OUT OF CONTROL.
they WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING.
please HELP ME STOP THEM.
go TO HELL.
Nathan, IT'S WHY PETER TOOK SYLAR'S ABILITY.
it's WHY--IT'S WHY HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF.
he KNOWS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THIS WORLD.
you DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND, MA. I UNDERSTAND.
you LOCKED PETER UP. PUT A SHUNT IN HIS HEAD.
you DID EXPERIMENTS ON ME.
and GOD KNOWS WHO ELSE.
who ELSE DID YOU USE AS YOUR OWN PERSONAL GUINEA PIG?
Nathan, LISTEN TO ME.
I'm SORRY.
what's NEXT?
I KNOW A SCIENTIST.
he UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THIS GENETIC STUFF.
if ANYBODY CAN HELP YOU, HE CAN.
can HE BE TRUSTED? -SURESH? YEAH, HE'S HARMLESS.
it's CLAIRE.
I TALKED TO MY DAD.
he SAID HE'S WILLING TO LISTEN.
it DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.
what HAPPENED?
they NEVER SHOWED UP.
you WERE RIGHT, CLAIRE.
my WIFE...MY KIDS... THEY'RE AFRAID OF ME.
maybe I AM A MONSTER.
couldn't PUT IT BETTER.
dad, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
it's ALL RIGHT.
we're JUST TALKING. I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL, STEPHEN.
my PARTNER IS STANDING RIGHT OVER THERE BY MY CAR.
you MAKE HIM DISAPPEAR,
and THIS IS ALL OVER.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
you WANT ME TO KILL YOUR PARTNER?
do IT, AND I'LL LET YOU GO.
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.
what ARE YOU SAYING? YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS.
stay OUT OF THIS, CLAIRE.
she's RIGHT, I CAN'T.
I'm NOT A KILLER.
maybe NOT. BUT HE IS.
and HE NEEDS TO BE DESTROYED.
unfortunately, I CAN'T DO IT.
please, I JUST -- I'M NOT ASKING.
dad, NO!
I'm DOING THIS FOR US, CLAIRE.
for WHAT SYLAR DID TO YOU.
you PEOPLE...
you've TAKEN EVERYTHING FROM ME.
do IT. KILL HIM NOW!
what ARE YOU DOING?
I WON'T BE A MONSTER.
No!
every hero hits a slump now and then.
slump?
are you kidding?
we are the worst heroes ever.
don't talk like that, Ando.
first we lost the formula.
then we lost the speedster.
then we lost Adma Monroe...
we're made mistake, but we can't lost heart.
the world is depending on us.
the world is screwed.
at least it can't get any worse.
Hello, BOYS.
nemesis.
SO...MY FRIEND HERE TELLS ME THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WORK.
and I SAID, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
those GOODY TWO-SHOES.
we HEARD ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
sign US UP.
I'm NOT CONVINCED.
we HAVE CHANGED. WE ARE BADASSES NOW.
Yes, WE ARE VERY BADASS.
when DO WE START?
not SO FAST.
you HAVE TO PROVE YOURSELF WORTHY.
how DO WE DO THAT?
you're THE ONE WITH THE POWERS?
Yes.
I CONTROL TIME AND SPACE.
cool.
kill THE OTHER ONE.
kill ANDO? -KILL ANDO?
Yeah, HE HAS NO POWERS.
what GOOD IS HE TO US?
you KILL HIM, YOU ARE BADASS.
I'm SORRY, MY FRIEND.
I MUST MAKE SOME SACRIFICES...
to SAVE THE WORLD.
we'll TALK MORE WHEN I COME HOME, OKAY?
Claire, WAIT.
I KNOW YOU'RE-- YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED,
but I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO...FOR US.
she DOESN'T BELIEVE A WORD YOU'RE SAYING.
she KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID BACK THERE,
why DIDN'T TAKE DOWN STEPHEN CANFIELD
when YOU HAD THE CHANCE.
nobody's TALKING TO YOU.
Claire FINALLY SEES YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE--A USER.
isn't THAT RIGHT, CLAIRE?
you USED HER TO TRY TO FIND THAT POOR MAN.
then YOU USED HIM TO TRY TO KILL ME,
because TO YOU...
I'm NOTHING BUT A MONSTER.
he DOESN'T SEE OUR HUMANITY, CLAIRE.
he NEVER WILL.
you're NOT GONNA LISTEN TO HIM, ARE YOU?
the MAN IS A DERANGED SOCIOPATH.
he's A KILLER. -HE'S A MONSTER.
Yes.
and YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER.
and EVERYTHING I DO IS TO PROTECT YOU.
to PROTECT THIS FAMILY.
tell ME YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
I UNDERSTAND.
it's ALL GONNA BE OKAY.
I PROMISE.
mom.
thank GOD. I WAS SO WORRIED.
are YOU OKAY?
cause IF YOU ARE, YOU ARE SO GROUNDED.
I'm SORRY.
I'm JUST GLAD MEREDITH FOUND YOU.
enjoying YOUR DINNER, MY DEAR?
eat.
now...
give ME A SWEET KISS.
go TO HELL, YOU FILTHY...
my GOD.
Peter, TELL ME YOU DIDN'T DO THIS, PLEASE.
Oh!
Ohh!
Hello, ANGELA.
no... IT CAN'T BE.
you CAN SEE THE FUTURE.
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.
it's TOO DANGEROUS.
no, YOU WON'T SUCCEED. I'LL STOP YOU.
don't BE RIDICULOUS.
you WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO MOVE.
you WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO MOVE.
you're LATE.
have YOU COMPLETED YOUR TASK?
they're ONBOARD. EVEN THE JAPANESE GUY.
look, I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
that's NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR.
I'm NOT A KILLER.
it's ALL PART OF MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE, DAPHNE.
no PAIN, NO GAIN.
there's ANOTHER ONE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RECRUIT.
I'm AFRAID HE'S GOING TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT.
what's HIS THING?
he HAS THE ABILITY TO ALTER YOUR MIND.
put THOUGHTS INTO YOUR HEAD.
make YOU SEE THINGS THAT AREN'T THERE.
speaking OF WHICH,
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT'S BEEN BUGGING ME ABOUT YOU.
I'm FAST. REAL FAST.
I CAN SNEAK UP ON EVERYBODY.
I CAN'T SNEAK UP ON YOU.
I KNEW IT!
you're NOT REALLY THERE.
it's NOT YOUR CONCERN, DAPHNE.
just BRING ME PARKMAN.
guess I DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE, DO I?
the TEAM IS COMING TOGETHER NICELY.
everything WENT FINE. PERFECT WITH NATHAN.
I MESSED WITH HIS HEAD.
I GAVE HIM VISIONS OF LINDERMAN, JUST LIKE YOU ASKED.
now HE THINKS HE'S DOING GOD'S WORK.
Yes.
very REAL.
daphne IS SPREADING THE WORD.
we're BUILDING AN ARMY, JUST LIKE YOU...
sorry.
Knox CALLED JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.
he'll HAVE ADAM MONROE HERE BY TOMORROW.
right.
Absolutely.
whatever YOU SAY GOES, MR. PETRELLI.
in every journey, the traveler must ask, "was the right path taken?
many roads are long and winding...
filled with those who have lost their way.
some forge their own course, guided by faith, seeking not a location, but a kindred soul.
others step together, finding safety in the arms of another.
a few remove themselves from the trail to avoid the path of temptation.
but those who watch the track too closely fail to see where it led them.
and they're often all too surprised by their destination.
kill the other one.
kill ando?!
Yeah, he has no powers.
what good is he to us?
you kill him, you are badass.
that's good.
he'll never do it.
Hiro?
Hello, milos.
Hiro?
I'm sorry, my friend.
I must make sacrifices to save the world.
Hiro.
okay.
you're in.
you handle the rest.
I'm taking adam monroe to see the boss.
Oh, my god!
you actually killed him.
that guy told me to.
badass!
that was to prove you wouldn't.
you're supposed to be a good guy.
now i'm a villain like you.
me?
I'm not a killer.
no, but you are a thief.
but i just do it for money.
it's not like anybody gets hurt.
well, i want my payday, too.
Ando was useless to me. he had no powers.
now take me to your boss.
I'm not taking you anywhere.
you get an assignment like everyone else.
here, you're going to africa.
he's a precog.
a what?
he can see the future.
whatever he paints comes true.
like mr. isaac.
whatever.
my boss can't have someone like that out there.
bring him to this address, alive.
just so you know, it's not easy catching a precog.
Why's that?
they see you coming.
Hi. where are you going?
Meredith went after this creep, and it's my fault.
mom, have you looked at his file?
he's psycho. she's in danger.
okay. i get it.
you want to fight bad guys, save the world, be a hero.
I don't need special abilities like your mother
your other mother-- to understand that.
thank you.
I really have to go.
I'm ready.
your father always said, "one of us, one of them.
I'm the one of us.
Meredith gordon...
as god as my witness, i'm going to make you love me again.
it's like i told you all night long, eric, i never loved you.
you disgust me.
you know, even when they stuck me on level five, i knew someday we'd be together again.
I'd like a destination wedding...
like fiji?
let me go, or i'll kill you.
you know how this works, meredith.
you can't make a move unless i make you move.
so i don't take orders from you.
stop it, eric.
Eric, please.
please.
you will love me, meredith.
I promise you that.
you've heard of me, right? adam monroe?
I'm guessing you have some sort of special ability.
what is it?
I get strong off other people's fear.
Ah. i'm not afraid.
seriously, you're wasting your time.
Arthur?
I heard you were dead.
wait.
No!
No!
please let me go.
you scared now?
Arthur, no, please!
I can be of use to you!
No!
No!
feels good to breathe again.
that would be a mistake, my dear.
are we not paying you enough money?
no, it's not that.
Hiro nakamura was a good guy, but...
we've turned him into a murderer.
I mean, i'm in way over my head here.
Daphne, you and i have discussed this before.
I can't do this anymore.
Oh, dear.
well, that's a shame.
you've done so much for us.
we've done so much for you
so much that we couldn't do for you anymore if you were to leave.
let's keep this little lapse of judgment to ourselves, shall we?
look, there's your next assignment.
okay, turtle, you got me home.
so now we just need to find daphne, save her life, get her to fall in love with me.
so you just give me a sign.
I can't believe i'm talking to a turtle.
high five, turtle.
Daphne?
how do you know who i am?
um, it's actually kind of complicated.
lucky guess.
can we go somewhere and talk?
Yeah.
uh, yeah.
Mohinder.
can we come in?
I'm relieved to see you're okay, niki, but, really, you should have called.
I'm in the middle of some sensitive trials here.
she's not niki.
we're sorry to interrupt you, dr. suresh, but we need your help.
I'm tracy. niki was my sister.
you're telling me you're not niki?
no.
Tracy has an ability, too.
that's why we're here.
a doctor did it-- zimmerman.
he altered our genes somehow.
a doctor did this to you?
how?
I don't know. i was just a baby.
this is exactly what i've been researching
how to give people abilities.
I was told the same thing was done to me, and you're saying that it is possible.
I know it is.
tell me, have you had any side effects?
she didn't even know about it until four days ago.
let me guess.
it first happened when you were in a state of heightened agitation.
you were frightened, angry.
it came over you like a wave you couldn't control.
Yes.
can you remove it?
Oh, i have a feeling we can be of great assistance to each other.
these people know things.
pinehearst? yeah.
they know how you struggled as a cop in l. a.
to protect and serve, but that wasn't enough for you, was it?
no.
no, it wasn't.
they know how you've been waiting your whole life just to be somebody.
it's sounds to me like you're...
not buying your own pitch.
no, i am.
I just got a lot of appointments today.
so are you in or out?
so this-- this isn't about us?
us?
Yeah.
no. sorry.
who told you my name?
no one.
I had this dream about the future.
but it wasn't a dream, it was real.
and you and i were
we were married.
and i know about your speed ability.
and we have this beautiful baby girl and this pet turtle.
and we were so... so happy.
we're soul mates.
I came here looking for you, and what did i find?
you're waiting for me.
I mean, that's got to mean something, right?
this is getting kind of stalky, so, um, i got to go.
no, no, no, wait a second. wait a second. wait a second.
uh, look, the address is on the card if you're interested.
we named our baby daniella...
after your grandmother.
how did-- how did you know
because i'm telling you the truth.
look, i have a bunch of stuff to do today, but...
can you wait here?
here?
Yeah.
Yeah. i'll be back.
don't go anywhere.
okay.
is this going to work?
and you're sure there's no side effects?
Oh. it's just a marker.
it tags any unusual dna.
you won't feel a thing, but it'll make my job much easier.
you know, I always thought my ability was a gift from god.
but after what my mother told me, i just
I need to know the truth.
I understand.
I once put all my faith in my father's research, followed it blindly.
I never got anywhere until i thought for myself.
let's do it.
inside you both is the solution to many problems.
with it, i can help everyone.
something's wrong.
wha
what's happening to her?
she'll be all right.
the roo
what have you done to us?
who are you? what are you doing?
my job-- to bring you out.
you're Sylar, right?
you have places to be.
the guards are here in a few seconds.
let's get going.
no.
no?
who do you work for?
someone who wants to work with you.
Why?
because you're a killer.
for some reason, you're important to him.
I don't ask questions like that.
now come on.
I'm not a killer anymore.
and you're not going anywhere.
look, i'm on your side!
can't you see they're trying to change you in here, make you into something that you're not?
you don't know anything about me!
but the man i work for does.
he likes you the way you are.
so you know where to find us.
we're going.
it's about time.
Peter...
Peter, you need to come with me.
Peter.
where am i? what are you doing?
I need your help.
get away from me!
no, no, no, no, no!
I'm not gonna hurt you.
you already did.
you gave me this hunger. you made me a monster.
now i can't control it. i'm just like you.
I don't want to be that anymore. i'm trying to be different.
I think i can control it, and if i can, then so can you.
when i saw you in the future, you...
you changed.
you found a way to suppress it. how?
I don't know.
but just knowing that i figure it out, just believing it's a possibility, gives me hope.
I don't want hope. i want it gone.
this is not about you and me.
I woke you because your mother's in trouble...
our mother.
this is where he lives?
according to the map why does he look familiar they all look the same to me that's racist what are you waiting for i'm tired of this all we wanted was to get your father's formula back now we're kidnapping an innocent man?
it's not kidnapping. we're just borrowing him until we get in with the villains then we bring him back now come on hello?
Mr. African Isaac?
she said she knew him.
maybe we just ought to give her a little more time.
she's still not answering her phone.
she's in trouble.
Oh, my god, Claire.
Where'd you get that thing?
dad's closet.
stay here. i'm going in.
Claire, we should call your father.
no, i don't want him here.
Claire, wait.
Claire, if we're gonna go in there, we need a plan.
I've always had two left feet.
I
but you
you were always graceful and light...
as a feather.
did you tell anyone you were here?
no.
I swear.
good.
welcome. nice to see you.
what do you want?
Hi.
Hi, i was, um, wondering if i could book a birthday party for my son, Lyle.

Yeah, i don't do parties anymore.
well, i would be willing to pay cash...
up front.
okay.

bring it back.
well, i'll just fill it out here, if you don't mind.
I think i have a pen.

on second thought, i will just take this little form and fill it out at home.
who are you?
Meredith.
come on.
come on.
we got to get out of here.
let them go.
I said, "let them go"!
no.
those things have just one shot, right?
that's much better.
Hiro?!
what happened that my nemesis was right cathing this future painter is very difficult why don't you time travel to one minute before he hit you hide behind the rock outside then grab him i can't, i swore never to go back in time again you went back to fake stab me it's just one mimute what could it hurt okay...just one minute couldn't hurt oh...no maybe. who are you?
how did you just
you know exactly how i just did that.
you know a lot about people like me.
that's why they sent me to you.
and what do they want with me?
access to your research, your database, contacts.
why on earth would i give them that?
that's not part of my job description.
all i know is that they've already figured out how to do the thing that you're trying to do...
to give people abilities.
they need your help. you need theirs.
help to do what?
save the world.
look...
if you have questions, you can ask them.
I'm just the messeng
what was that?
help us.
great.
you're just as bad as the rest of them.
it's showtime, ladies.
the gun has just one bullet.
what is it you want, you sick
what i want, barbie, is not to be interrupted, but since you're so eager, why don't you spin the gun?
all right.
time to choose.
who you gonna shoot?
no, no, i can't.
you're not scared, are you?
I mean, 'cause you're the hero with the big old gun.
stop it.
leave her alone.
what are you, her mother?
Oh, this is too good.
you are her mother.
so what does that make you, Meredith?
I mean, 'cause, you know, you're too old to be her daughter too.
so let's see.
sexy, free spirit...
Oh, you're the fun aunt, right?
the one that barbie really looks up to.
go to hell!
so...
what's it gonna be, huh?
P. t.a. mom who tucks you in every night?
or cool aunt with flame-throwing action?
I mean, come on, there's only a one-in-six chance it'll even go off.
please, don't make me do this.
fine.
I'll choose for you.
stop it! stop!
I promise you, i will love you forever and ever.
I don't believe you.
pull the trigger.
No! if you don't do it, i will.
okay, mom, your turn to spin.
listen to me. leave them alone!
I
Oh, you got to love the irony.
I mean, it's like a greek tragedy or something, right?
okay, mom, do it.
I won't.
Yes, you will.
okay, look, these could be your final words, barbie, so make them count.
mom...
mom, it's okay.
it's me.
you can't fight him.
do what you have to do.
pull the trigger.
okay.
that was fun, huh?
show's over.
I found her like this. she's in some kind of a coma.
you're worried.
you actually care about her.
she's my mother, too, Peter.
she's the only person who ever accepted me for what i am.
I should've protected her.
you've got to look inside of her head.
we've got to find out what's wrong.
what was it? what did you see?
just this.
I've seen this before.
so have i.
that ought to keep him down for a little while.
it's a good thing you called me.
Claire, you were amazing.
no, i wasn't. i got us caught.
no, you saved us.
you may have got your genes from me, but...
you got your heart from your mom.
you did this, Claire?
that's very impressive, sweetheart.
Claire!
I'll talk to her.
she...
just has a wrong idea about me in her head.
she's a young woman now, Noah.
she just wants to be on her own.
she doesn't need you or me to protect her.
well, maybe not, but there are a lot more people like eric doyle out there.
I could use some help.
what, from claire?
no...
from you.
Peter, don't.
you're in no condition to go to pinehearst.
they spread abilities, cause the end of the world.
they did this to her. well, i want revenge for what they did to mom, too
stop calling her that!
you are not my family. what you took from me
my ability-- i've lived with it.
the need for power will consume you.
it will control you.
get out of my way. no. i'm your brother.
you got to listen to me, peter. you need help.
I don't need anything from you!
I'm not gonna let you leave, peter.
I've been down that path.
it's too dangerous!
you're too weak to stop me.
I know what it feels like now...
all this power.
I'm the most special.
I know what you're thinking.
you didn't mean for any of this to happen.
you try to fix it, but everything you do just makes it worse.
it all got out of control.
but that girl that was here gave you a way out, some answers.
this was all so unnecessary.
Maya was right.
I am a monster.
maybe we all are.
I understand.
Nathan, are you okay?
come here.
okay.
we're not finished here.
what, you're not hungry?
Yeah, me neither.
you came back.
Yeah.
I'm supposed to recruit you to pinehearst, but you wouldn't fit in.
I-it's not you. it's...
I mean, it is you, but it's these people and the things that they do.
they're not good people.
and you seem like a really sweet guy, so...
great.
oka-- well, that's...
that's great.
I mean, that means that, uh, you know, you and i should def
that means that you need to stay away from them.
actually, uh...
you have to stay away from them too.
in the future, pinehearst is gonna...
get you killed.
that's why i wanted to find you, to save you...
to keep that from happening.
you read minds, not the future.
I know, i know, but i met a guy in africa, and everything thing that he paints...
comes true.
Yes! so you've got to stay with me.
no, you don't get it.
I have to go back. i don't have a choice.
but you don't trust these people.
if you can read my thoughts, then you know that i don't know if i can trust you either.
forget your thoughts.
what is your heart telling you to do?
the same as it always does.
keep moving too fast to get caught.
what do they have over you?
I can protect you.
no...
you can't.
Bye, parkman.
Congratulations.
you were relying too much on your powers.
you forgot how to use your head.
but when you started to think, that's when you found me.
this was a test?
Yes.
and now you are ready.
these are the villains you seek.
you can take me to them, or you can follow your own path.
Mr. petrelli? i know.
the bad guys are here.
that's what they call you, isn't it?
criminals, villains.
it's okay!
he's my son.
dad?
Peter.
how is this possible? you're...
you're dead.
it's a long story.
so you're behind all this? you...
you hurt mom?
like i say, we need to talk.
come give your father a hug.
it's all right, peter.
it's all right.
I'm sorry it had to come to this.
you don't have your powers anymore, peter...
because i have them now.
evil forces gather.
the dark sun rises. Soon it will be too late.
will you choose your own path or will you have it chosen for you?
you've ruined everything.
don't come any closer.
what the hell happened in here?
I'm trying to help maya to remove her ability.
so you knock us out?
you experiment on us?
your abilities are synthetic.
they may hold the key to creating a cure.
if I could have one more sample -no, it's finished.
we're done.
dad's dead. He had a heart attack.
your father, he was deeply flawed in ways you will never know.
I can't believe he's gone.
dad's dead.
dad?
you're dead.
dad's dead. He had a heart attack this morning.
come give your father a hug.
I'm sorry it had to come to this.
No!
take it easy, peter.
your body is still in shock.
you took my abilities.
you gave me no choice, son.
are they gone forever? -Yes.
how am I supposed to believe any of this?
you've been dead for over a year.
then I find you preaching to some supervillian gang?
I'm sorry that I lied to you and your brother, but I've had to make hard choices for the greater good.
giving everyone on the planet an ability. That's really your idea of the greater good?
that's not what I want. -That's what happens.
I've seen the future, dad.
I've seen the whole neighborhood get nuked.
you can help me. Together we can make sure that the future you saw never happens.
once you understand what I'm doing - - I'm not interested in what you're doing.
with or without my powers, I'm going to find a way to shut you down, and I'm going to make you pay for everything you've ever done.
son, until you change that attitude, you're grounded.
you okay?
I think so.
is that weird?
we just starred in a human puppet show, my dad is working with a serial killer, and I can't feel pain.
Claire, the things you deal with, the demons you face, I can't imagine...
how you handle them.
that you stay strong in the face of it all.
that makes me proud.
Thanks.
what's wrong with the lights?
m I'going to check the circuit breakers.
Oh, my god. What happened?
are you okay?
bitch is back.
Hey, cheerleader.
what the hell are you doing here?
get out of my house.
not until I get what I came for.
fine.
then I'll throw you out!
leave me alone!
why are you here?
I'm sorry.
I need help.
and I didn't know where else to go.
I apologize for keeping you waiting, doctor.
I'm arthur petrelli.
everyone thinks you're dead.
that was the idea.
what could possibly drive a father to put his children through such grief?
have you met their mother?
how is our patient? -Terrified.
she thinks I'm a monster and has no idea where she is.
nor do I, for that matter.
you're among friends.
I promised maya I would remove her abilities and end her suffering.
I will do anything to keep that promise.
all you have to do is watch.
get away from me.
get him out of here.
you're telling me all traces of maya's ability have been removed from her system.
I take it all and leave nothing behind.
could you do the same to me?
is that what you want?
to be normal again?
I injected myself with an unstable formula.
its side effects are changing me into something else, something I don't understand.
I need to find a way to reverse the changes and retain my abilities.
this isn't my formula.
the cytologies are similar, but these protein links are enmeshed has it been successful?
we've taken it as far as we can. That's why we need you.
if you can make our version of the formula successful, a fresh injection might be exactly what you need.
I've been down this road before.
there is always a hidden agenda.
a self-serving motivation behind it all.
if you don't want to be here, leave.
I'll need test subjects.
momma.
how are you here? You're sick.
Peter needs your help.
Peter doesn't want anything to do with me, he thinks I'm just a killer.
this isn't about what he wants.
this is about what I am telling you to do.
now stop feeling sorry for yourself and get out of this cell.
this is where I belong...
in a cage.
I couldn't escape even if I wanted to. They're blocking my abilities.
then how do you explain my being here?
you don't know the half of what you're capable of.
show them.
show them all why you're my favorite.
make mommy proud.
don't worry, mom.
I'll save peter.
are you going to be okay?
Yeah, fine. I'm leaving.
is... there something wrong with you?
I can't control it anymore.
I keep overloading. And
I can't eat, I can't sleep...
this girl found me, said I should go to this company, pinehearst.
that they knew what was wrong with me and how to get me better.
but I've never heard of it.
I didn't want to go there without knowing what the deal was.
and your dad, your dad always seemed to be the one with the answers.
so home invasion time.
what if there's something wrong with all of us and they can fix it?
you're fine.
you're perfect.
no, I'm not.
whatever's happening to you, it's happening to me, too.
you're still healing, aren't you? -Yeah.
but I can't feel pain.
and I think it's only a matter of time before I can't feel anything at all.
you can't feel pain.
I wish I had your problems, cheerleader.
my body is screaming. I'm in agony.
go with me.
if there's a chance that these people at pinehearst can help us, we'll go together.
all right, dorothy.
then we're off to see the wizard.
you have a mess to clean up.
I do?
you were supposed to recruit my son, matt parkman.
Yeah, I gave him the pitch, but he wasn't buying.
I mean, the guy's a mind-reader.
were you thinking something which would discourage him from joining us?
that's not what I meant.
she's lying.
I am not.
then why are you so scared?
how can I fix this?
re-visit mr. Parkman.
but I don't think he's going to take the deal.
you're not going there to offer him anything. You're going there to kill him.
what?
I just asked her to kill your son, maury, is that a problem?
you're damn right.
my loyalty for his safety. That was the arrangement.
I'm a thief.
I steal things. There's no way I could kill anybody.
I'm not going to let you do this, arthur.
you're not in a position to give me orders.
I'm matt's father.
without me, you'd still be lying
thank you, maury, for all your sacrifice.
please.
there has to be another way.
but you don't know anything about this place.
look, elle needs help and so do I.
this pinehearst place could be our best shot.
pinehearst, sounds like a dishwashing liquid.
I gotta call your dad.
mom.
please don'T.
Claire, he loves you. -I know.
but there's something inside of me, and it's broken.
and he can't fix it.
I think I'm the only one who can.
do you understand that?
do you really think you can trust elle? -No.
but we both want the same thing. We need our abilities under control.
if she gives you any lip, you just toss a glass of water on her.
Lyle style.
this is dr. Mohinder suresh. I am not available. Please leave a message, and I'll call you back.
Mohinder, it's matt.
where the hell you been, man? I just got back from the craziest week of my life.
uh, do me a favor, give me a call as soon as possible, okay?
put down the phone. -Daphne.
what are you doing?
they think that I told you not to come to pinehearst. That I warned you away.
they don't believe I'm one of them.
well, you're not. -Shut up.
if I don't kill you, they'll kill me.
shoot.
what? -Shoot me.
go ahead. If it's the only way that i can save your life, do it.
you think you know me, that I'm worth saving, but I've done some bad things.
you make up for all that in the future.
I don't have a future...
unless I kill you, so...
turn around.
do it.
we get married.
we start a family together.
stop it.
we're going to love each other.
I'm sorry, matt.
it happened so fast, there was nothing I could do.
my dad?
so I guess you're not going to help.
don't do this, dad.
please, you're going to destroy the world.
I don't see it that way.
you think you're better than everyone else?
that you have the right to do whatever you want? Hurt anyone that gets in your way?
I am better, peter. It's not a belief, it's a fact.
and one way or another, you will help me get this done.
Hello, peter.
so you're helping my father.
I prefer to think he's helping me.
and what is that?
your metabolism is primed to accept abilities.
which makes you the ideal test case for a new version of the formula.
I need to perfect it.- Wait, wait, wait, when I saw you in the future, you said that manipulating abilities was wrong.
that this was all a mistake.- Did I?
you were trying to help me, mohinder.
you need to tell me something, in this future of yours...
what do I look like?
there was something wrong with you.
you changed.
you looked like a monster.
then you're too late.
Suresh, no.
Hello, mohinder.
you came for me?
that's what brothers do, peter.
they look out for each other.
even after I locked you up?
let's get out of here.
stop, leave him alone!- He deserves to die.
this is for killing my father.
that's enough. Enough!
do you know who this man is?
do you have any idea how many innocent people he's killed?
I do. But he's also my son.
and I've been waiting for him for a long time.
it's been hours.
who'd you talk to over there?
some guy from the company.
he can keep a secret, right?
I hope so.
do you think they're alive?
do you think they're human?
what if they can't breathe?
we need to help them.
be careful.
Oh, god.
it's too tough.
I told you not to touch anything.
you.
well, I see you've still got a weakness for blondes.
everything all right?
I'm what some people would refer to as an anxious flyer.
big tough company agent can't handle being 30, 000 feet up?
Yeah, well I was never a very good agent.
so I read. You, uh, let all those villains escape level five, right?
shut up.
Yeah, I caught doyle. I helped clean up your mess.
Yeah, the freak with the puppets.
this agent thing isn't so hard.
you know, my father pushed me into this life. I wanted no part of it.
and if you do, you're an idiot.- Elle.
you have no idea how good you have it.
this is your captain speaking.
we'd like to remind our passengers to turn off all electrical equipment.
thank you.
I think he's talking about you.- Shut up!
seriously, calm down.
you have to turn it off or we're going to crash.
if I knew how to do that, I wouldn't be here in the first place.
take my hand.
let me help you. Dump your electricity into me.
do it!
we did it.
do you mind?
my dad and i weren't even close.
to think that he would ever put himself in danger to protect me...
well, he didn't do it, so you can sit around here and wait to get killed.
what do you mean?
they'll be sending someone after me to make sure you're dead.
let them come oh yeah . great. You're going to use your brain mojo thingy.
perfect.
if you need to go, I understand.
but I can't let them get away with this.
I wanna help you.
I'm just scared.
so am I.
but we can't let our fears stop us from doing what's right.
I knew you couldn't kill him.- I'm sorry, matt.
no, stick to the plan.
your fear is making me strong, girl.
I can'T.- No.
No!
stop.
you think you can hold me with a power?
not only can I hold you, I can kill you.
I'm going to dig inside your head, find your worst fear, and make it eat you alive.
I'm not the one that's scared.
you are.
and your fear just makes me strong.
that was amazing.
Yeah, well you know, I got inside his head with my brain mojo thingy.
my dad could do the same thing.
now that they think that we're dead, we have time to get away.
no. I told you, I'm not running.
what are you going to do, matt?
fight them?
trick them into killing each other? That's not going to bring your dad back.
but it will probably get you killed.
I'm a cop. Stopping guys like knox, that's what I do.
you can't bring them down by yourself.
there's no way. Even with me at your back, we still need help.
there's a company, primatech.
they know how to deal with situations like this.
if anybody can help, they can.
building sealed up tight.
if peter's still here, he ain't getting out.
Peter's long gone.
if I find him, do you want him crispy or well-done?
alive, please.
I sent somebody to recruit you, when you refused her offer, I didn't expect to see you here.
my mother's in a coma. Did you do that?
Angela's not the woman you think she is, gabriel.
she's done terrible things.
so have I, and I'm going to do them all to you.
has angela forgiven your sins?
my mother accepts me for who I am.
I wonder if you'll be so generous.
what are you talking about?
she sent you here, didn't she? To save her favorite son.
did she tell you that you were all going to live happily ever after?
she's using you, son, as a weapon.
a blunt instrument to be manipulated and then discarded.
my mother loves me.
when you were born, she had one of her dreams. A vision of the future.
she saw what you would become- yeah, I know this.
she told me I'd become a hero.
did she?
angela was so terrified of what she saw, so frightened of her own flesh and blood, that she tried to kill you.
imagine that, a mother wanting to murder her own child.
I got to the bathroom just in time.
she was holding you at the bottom of the tub.
it's time you learned the truth about your mother.
that's...
far enough.
I was told you were leaving.
maybe one day I could forgive you, but after everything that's happened, I just.
I don't think I could ever trust you.
I know it's hard to believe, but I was trying to help.
my feelings for you were real.
those feelings are still there.
what you did in my name was wrong.
I wish I could take it all back.
I've done bad things, killed people...
not by choice, but still.I did them.
I need to make amends.
and so do you.
get well, mohinder.
hold on.
we're almost there. You all right?
thank you.
for what?
for helping me.
I've been nothing but a bitch. And you've been nothing but sweet.
really just makes me hate you more.
no, I should be the one thanking you.
Why?
because I was ready to give up.
stay home, deny everything that's been happening to me.
I was scared.
Edscar of what?
what I would find out about who I really am.
it's just...
it's nice to know that you're as messed up as I am.
Peter, you stayed?- I wasn't going to leave you.
what are you doing sitting here? Did he take your powers?
no, he told me the truth.- You can't listen to him.
but he's our father.- He's my father. I grew up with him.
Oh, and I didn't, so I don't get the right to know him. Is that what you're saying?
he can't be trusted.
you've seen what he's done.
he hurt mom. He's manipulated abilities, I know where that leads.
the world you saw doesn't exist.
we won't let it.
I'm sorry, peter, this is something I have to do.
you help him, and you're proving all the worst things I've ever said about you.
just kick his ass and let's get out of here.
no, I'm not going anywhere, peter.
you are.
Oh, my god, peter!
what are you doing here?
why are you bleeding?
he's not healing.
he took my ability. We need to go.
Elle, help me get him in the car.
did you hear what he said? That they took his ability.
that's what we came here for.
you don't know what happened up there.
I'm sorry, claire.- Elle!
if you can't heal, how did you fall that far and not die?
I don't know.
okay, let me get this straight.
she's the biological mother of your illegitimate daughter, and he's her adopted father.
that sounds about right.
did suresh inject you with anything?
Yeah, a tranquilizer, why?
what's he doing in there?
building a nest.
laying eggs. Who the hell knows?
you're both going to have to come into the company to be tested.
for what?- Just to be sure you're still normal.
so you're working with him?
for now.
excuse me.
I'd watch out for that one.
Oh, we're not together.
slow down, slow down.
where are you?
no, I won't tell anyone.
Peter's never going to give up, you know.
I would expect nothing less of a petrelli.
revenge is in our blood.
we're just gonna wait for him to come after us.
no, son.
we're going to take our fight to the enemy.
how do you suppose peter survived that fall?
seven stories without the ability to heal.
hell of a thing.
I don't know.
Hello?
it worked.
he thinks I'm on his side.
good job.
if he reaches out to primatech, I'll let you know what they say.
screw this up, and I'll put you right back where I found you.
I keep thinking about that fall.
how I didn't hit as hard as I should have.
what if sylar didn't want me to die?
what if...he wanted to get me out of there alive?
by throwing you out of a window?
no, he could have used his ability to slow me down.
I'm telling you he saved my life, claire.
it's all right. She's good.
what happened?
why aren't you healing?
I don't have my powers anymore, nathan.
dad took 'em.
dad's dead.
he's not, he's alive.
I was there, pete. I saw it- he's alive, nathan.
and if we don't do something to stop him, he's going to kill us all.
that's just-- that's impossible, pete.
dad died over a year ago.
he's the one who put mom in that coma.
Pete, this is our dad we're talking about here.
believe me, dads aren't always what they seem.
where is he?- Stay away from him.
he's dangerous, nathan.
look what he did to me.
if our father's alive, I needowo kn where he is.
what's the n eof the company?
pinehearst, the bio-tech firm?
no, I'm not going to let you do this.
Nathan... trust me. Please.
okay. We'll do it your way.
there's a lot of ways to shut pinehearst down.
I'll go call somebody up from the justice department.
we'll get some help.
you're not going to listen to a word he just said, are you?
Nope, I'm going to see my father.
how do you know about pinehearst?
I've been taking a consultant fee from them for over a year.
I'm coming with you.
I know the players there, I can open doors.
I don't need any doors opened.
I plan on kicking them down.
is that food?
it's a recipe.
it's been in my family for thousands of years.
you refuse to go back in time.
even if it means saving the world.
I cannot risk changing history.
if only there is some other way of learning about my enemies.
uncovering their weak spots, so I can defeat them.
for thousands of years, my family have taken spirit walks.
following destiny's path into the realms of the unconsciousness.
delicious.
spirit walk sounds much safer than time traveling.
okay...
I'm ready to begin my journey.
how do I start?
you eat a disgusting paste made from the roots of a tamboti tree.
and the dung of hyena.
and then?
you wait.
Hiro!
Hiro!
you tricked him.
I warned him.
if he did not choose his path, it would be chosen for him.
Hiro. Hiro.
he's going to wake up, right?
he's going to be okay?
Hiro-- hiro, hiro!
to be continued
Peter - your brother.
dad?
come GIVE YOUR FATHER A HUG.
you can't that was fun, uh?
show is over.
what is it?
I'm not. Before.
you go to Africa, P.Carke.
somewhere in Africa no, Ando! I will not do it!
I will not go back in time!
you told me a hero must take risks and make sacrifices to save the world!
I say many crazy things!
you need to go to these moments!
and find out how to defeat these villains!
I cannot! If I go back in time,
I will only make matters worse!
you went to the future! You saw the world end!
what could be worse than the end of the world?!
evil FORCES GATHER.
the DARK SUN RISES.
soon IT WILL BE TOO LATE.
will YOU CHOOSE YOUR OWN PATH OR WILL YOU HAVE IT CHOSEN FOR YOU?
you've RUINED EVERYTHING.
don't COME ANY CLOSER.
what THE HELL HAPPENED IN HERE?
I'm TRYING TO HELP MAYA TO REMOVE HER ABILITY.
so YOU KNOCK US OUT?
you EXPERIMENT ON US?
your ABILITIES ARE SYNTHETIC.
they MAY HOLD THE KEY TO CREATING A CURE.
if I COULD HAVE ONE MORE SAMPLE......
no, IT'S FINISHED.
we're DONE.
dad's DEAD.
he HAD A HEART ATTACK.
your FATHER, HE WAS DEEPLY FLAWED.
in WAYS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S GONE.
dad's DEAD.
dad?
you're DEAD.
dad's DEAD.
he HAD A HEART ATTACK THIS MORNING.
come GIVE YOUR FATHER A HUG.
I'm SORRY.
No!
take IT EASY, PETER.
your BODY IS STILL IN SHOCK.
you TOOK MY ABILITIES.
you GAVE ME NO CHOICE, SON.
are THEY GONE FOREVER?
Yes.
how AM I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE ANY OF THIS?
you've BEEN DEAD FOR OVER A YEAR.
then I FIND YOU PREACHING TO SOME SUPERVILLIAN GANG?
I'm SORRY THAT I LIED TO YOU AND YOUR BROTHER,
but I'VE HAD TO MAKE HARD CHOICES FOR THE GREATER GOOD.
giving EVERYONE ON THE PLANET AN ABILITY.
that's REALLY YOUR IDEA OF THE GREATER GOOD?
that's NOT WHAT I WANT.
that's WHAT HAPPENS.
I've SEEN THE FUTURE, DAD.
I've SEEN THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD GET NUKED.
you CAN HELP ME.
together WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE FUTURE YOU SAW NEVER HAPPENS.
once YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M DOING.
I'm NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
with OR WITHOUT MY POWERS,
I'm GOING TO FIND A WAY TO SHUT YOU DOWN,
and I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU PAY FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE.
son,
until YOU CHANGE THAT ATTITUDE,
you're GROUNDED.
chapter Seven "Eris Quod Sum"
you OKAY?
I THINK SO.
is THAT WEIRD?
we JUST STARRED IN A HUMAN PUPPET SHOW,
my DAD IS WORKING WITH A SERIAL KILLER,
and I CAN'T FEEL PAIN.
Claire, THE THINGS YOU DEAL WITH,
the DEMONS YOU FACE, I CAN'T IMAGINE...
how YOU HANDLE THEM.
that YOU STAY STRONG IN THE FACE OF IT ALL THAT MAKES ME PROUD.
Thanks.
what's WRONG WITH THE LIGHTS?
I'm GOING TO CHECK THE CIRCUIT BREAKERS.
Oh, MY GOD. WHAT HAPPENED?
are YOU OKAY?
bitch IS BACK.
Hey, CHEERLEADER.
what THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
get OUT OF MY HOUSE.
not UNTIL I GET WHAT I CAME FOR.
fine.
then I'LL THROW YOU OUT!
leave ME ALONE!
why ARE YOU HERE?
I'm SORRY.
I NEED HELP.
and I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO.
I APOLOGIZE FOR KEEPING YOU WAITING, DOCTOR.
I'm ARTHUR PETRELLI.
everyone THINKS YOU'RE DEAD.
that WAS THE IDEA.
what COULD POSSIBLY DRIVE A FATHER TO PUT HIS CHILDREN THROUGH SUCH GRIEF?
have YOU MET THEIR MOTHER?
how IS OUR PATIENT?
terrified.
she THINKS I'M A MONSTER
and HAS NO IDEA WHERE SHE IS.
nor DO I, FOR THAT MATTER.
you're AMONG FRIENDS.
I PROMISED MAYA I WOULD REMOVE HER ABILITIES AND END HER SUFFERING.
I WILL DO ANYTHING TO KEEP THAT PROMISE.
all YOU HAVE TO DO IS WATCH.
get AWAY FROM ME.
get HIM OUT OF HERE.
you're TELLING ME ALL TRACES OF MAYA'S ABILITY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM HER SYSTEM.
I TAKE IT ALL AND LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND.
could YOU DO THE SAME TO ME?
is THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
to BE NORMAL AGAIN?
I INJECTED MYSELF WITH AN UNSTABLE FORMULA.
its SIDE EFFECTS ARE CHANGING ME INTO SOMETHING ELSE,
something I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I NEED TO FIND A WAY TO REVERSE THE CHANGES,
and RETAIN MY ABILITIES.
this ISN'T MY FORMULA.
the CYTOLOGIES ARE SIMILAR,
but THESE PROTEIN LINKS ARE ENMESHED.
has IT BEEN SUCCESSFUL?
we've TAKEN IT AS FAR AS WE CAN.
that's WHY WE NEED YOU.
if YOU CAN MAKE OUR VERSION OF THE FORMULA SUCCESSFUL,
a FRESH INJECTION MIGHT BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED.
I've BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE.
there IS ALWAYS A HIDDEN AGENDA.
a SELF - SERVING MOTIVATION BEHIND IT ALL.
if YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE, LEAVE.
I'll NEED TEST SUBJECTS.
momma.
how ARE YOU HERE? YOU'RE SICK.
Peter NEEDS YOUR HELP.
Peter DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME,
he THINKS I'M JUST A KILLER.
this ISN'T ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS.
this IS ABOUT WHAT I AM TELLING YOU TO DO.
now STOP FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF AND GET OUT OF THIS CELL.
this IS WHERE I BELONG... IN A CAGE.
I COULDN'T ESCAPE EVEN IF I WANTED TO.
they're BLOCKING MY ABILITIES.
then HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN MY BEING HERE?
you DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.
show THEM.
show THEM ALL WHY YOU'RE MY FAVORITE.
make MOMMY PROUD.
don't WORRY, MOM.
I'll SAVE PETER.
are YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?
Yeah, FINE.
I'm LEAVING.
is... THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU?
I CAN'T CONTROL IT ANYMORE.
I KEEP OVERLOADING.
and I CAN'T EAT,
I CAN'T SLEEP...
this GIRL FOUND ME,
said I SHOULD GO TO THIS COMPANY, PINEHEARST.
that THEY KNEW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME AND HOW TO GET ME BETTER.
but I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.
and YOUR DAD,
your DAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE THE ONE WITH THE ANSWERS.
so HOME INVASION TIME.
what IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ALL OF US AND THEY CAN FIX IT?
you're FINE.
you're PERFECT.
no, I'M NOT.
whatever's HAPPENING TO YOU,
it's HAPPENING TO ME, TOO.
you're STILL HEALING, AREN'T YOU?
Yeah.
but I CAN'T FEEL PAIN.
and I THINK IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING AT ALL.
you CAN'T FEEL PAIN.
I WISH I HAD YOUR PROBLEMS,
cheerleader.
my BODY IS SCREAMING.
I'm IN AGONY.
go WITH ME.
if THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THESE PEOPLE AT PINEHEARST CAN HELP US, WE'LL GO TOGETHER.
all RIGHT, DOROTHY.
then WE'RE OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD.
you HAVE A MESS TO CLEAN UP.
I DO?
you WERE SUPPOSED TO RECRUIT MY SON, MATT PARKMAN.
Yeah, I GAVE HIM THE PITCH, BUT HE WASN'T BUYING.
I MEAN, THE GUY'S A MIND-READER.
were YOU THINKING SOMETHING WHICH WOULD DISCOURAGE HIM FROM JOINING US?
that's NOT WHAT I MEANT.
she's LYING.
I AM NOT.
then WHY ARE YOU SO SCARED?
how CAN I FIX THIS?
re - VISIT MR. PARKMAN.
but I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO TAKE THE DEAL.
you're NOT GOING THERE TO OFFER HIM ANYTHING.
you're GOING THERE TO KILL HIM.
what?
I JUST ASKED HER TO KILL YOUR SON,
Maury, IS THAT A PROBLEM?
you're DAMN RIGHT.
my LOYALTY FOR HIS SAFETY.
that WAS THE ARRANGEMENT.
I'm A THIEF.
I STEAL THINGS.
there's NO WAY I COULD KILL ANYBODY.
I'm NOT GOING TO LET YOU DO THIS, ARTHUR.
you're NOT IN A POSITION TO GIVE ME ORDERS.
I'm MATT'S FATHER.
without ME, YOU'D STILL BE LYING
thank YOU, MAURY,
for ALL YOUR SACRIFICE.
please.
there HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY.
but YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE.
look, ELLE NEEDS HELP AND SO DO I.
this PINEHEARST PLACE COULD BE OUR BEST SHOT.
pinehearst, SOUNDS LIKE A DISHWASHING LIQUID.
I GOTTA CALL YOUR DAD.
mom.
please DON'T.
Claire, HE LOVES YOU.
I KNOW.
but THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME,
and IT'S BROKEN.
and HE CAN'T FIX IT.
I THINK I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN.
do YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
do YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN TRUST ELLE?
no.
but WE BOTH WANT THE SAME THING.
we NEED OUR ABILITIES UNDER CONTROL.
if SHE GIVES YOU ANY LIP,
you JUST TOSS A GLASS OF WATER ON HER...
Lyle STYLE.
this IS DR. MOHINDER SURESH.
I AM NOT AVAILABLE.
please LEAVE A MESSAGE, AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
Mohinder, IT'S MATT.
where THE HELL YOU BEEN, MAN?
I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE CRAZIEST WEEK OF MY LIFE.
uh, DO ME A FAVOR, GIVE ME A CALL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, OKAY?
put DOWN THE PHONE.
what ARE YOU DOING?
they THINK THAT I TOLD YOU NOT TO COME TO PINEHEARST.
that I WARNED YOU AWAY.
they DON'T BELIEVE I'M ONE OF THEM.
well, YOU'RE NOT. SHUT UP.
if I DON'T KILL YOU, THEY'LL KILL ME.
shoot.
what? SHOOT ME. GO AHEAD.
if IT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE, DO IT.
you THINK YOU KNOW ME,
that I'M WORTH SAVING, BUT I'VE DONE SOME BAD THINGS.
you MAKE UP FOR ALL THAT IN THE FUTURE.
I DON'T HAVE A FUTURE...
unless I KILL YOU, SO... TURN AROUND.
do IT.
we GET MARRIED.
we START A FAMILY TOGETHER.
stop IT.
we're GOING TO LOVE EACH OTHER.
I'm SORRY, MATT.
it HAPPENED SO FAST, THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.
my DAD?
so I GUESS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HELP.
don't DO THIS, DAD.
please, YOU'RE GOING TO DESTROY THE WORLD.
I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.
you THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE?
that YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT?
hurt ANYONE THAT GETS IN YOUR WAY?
I AM BETTER, PETER.
it's NOT A BELIEF, IT'S A FACT.
and ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, YOU WILL HELP ME GET THIS DONE.
Hello, PETER.
so YOU'RE HELPING MY FATHER.
I PREFER TO THINK HE'S HELPING ME.
and WHAT IS THAT?
your METABOLISM IS PRIMED TO ACCEPT ABILITIES.
I NEED TO PERFECT IT.
wait, WAIT, WAIT, WHEN I SAW YOU IN THE FUTURE,
you SAID THAT MANIPULATING ABILITIES WAS WRONG.
that THIS WAS ALL A MISTAKE.
did I?
you WERE TRYING TO HELP ME, MOHINDER.
you NEED TO TELL ME SOMETHING,
in THIS FUTURE OF YOURS...
what DO I LOOK LIKE?
there WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.
you CHANGED.
you LOOKED LIKE A MONSTER.
then YOU'RE TOO LATE.
Suresh, NO.
Hello, MOHINDER.
you CAME FOR ME?
that's WHAT BROTHERS DO, PETER.
they LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.
even AFTER I LOCKED YOU UP?
let's GET OUT OF HERE.
stop, LEAVE HIM ALONE!
he DESERVES TO DIE.
this IS FOR KILLING MY FATHER.
that's ENOUGH.
enough!
do YOU KNOW WHO THIS MAN IS?
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE HE'S KILLED?
I DO. BUT HE'S ALSO MY SON.
and I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HIM FOR A LONG TIME.
it's BEEN HOURS.
who'd YOU TALK TO OVER THERE?
some GUY FROM THE COMPANY.
he CAN KEEP A SECRET, RIGHT?
I HOPE SO.
do YOU THINK THEY'RE ALIVE?
do YOU THINK THEY'RE HUMAN?
what IF THEY CAN'T BREATHE?
we NEED TO HELP THEM.
be CAREFUL.
Oh, GOD.
it's TOO TOUGH.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING.
you.
well, I SEE YOU'VE STILL GOT A WEAKNESS FOR BLONDES.
everything ALL RIGHT?
I'm WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD REFER TO AS AN ANXIOUS FLYER.
big TOUGH COMPANY AGENT CAN'T HANDLE BEING 30, 000 FEET UP?
Yeah, WELL I WAS NEVER A VERY GOOD AGENT.
so I READ.
you, UH, LET ALL THOSE VILLAINS ESCAPE LEVEL FIVE, RIGHT?
shut UP.
Yeah, I CAUGHT DOYLE.
I HELPED CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.
Yeah, THE FREAK WITH THE PUPPETS.
this AGENT THING ISN'T SO HARD.
you KNOW, MY FATHER PUSHED ME INTO THIS LIFE.
I WANTED NO PART OF IT.
and IF YOU DO, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
you HAVE NO IDEA HOW GOOD YOU HAVE IT.
this IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING.
we'd LIKE TO REMIND OUR PASSENGERS TO TURN OFF ALL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT.
thank YOU.
I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU. SHUT UP!
seriously, CALM DOWN.
you HAVE TO TURN IT OFF OR WE'RE GOING TO CRASH.
if I KNEW HOW TO DO THAT,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
take MY HAND.
let ME HELP YOU.
dump YOUR ELECTRICITY INTO ME.
do IT!
we DID IT.
do YOU MIND?
my DAD AND I WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE.
to THINK THAT HE WOULD EVER PUT HIMSELF IN DANGER TO PROTECT ME...
well, HE DIDN'T DO IT, SO YOU CAN SIT AROUND HERE AND WAIT TO GET KILLED.
what DO YOU MEAN?
they'll BE SENDING SOMEONE AFTER ME TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE DEAD.
let THEM COME.
mm, YEAH. GREAT.
you're GOING TO USE YOUR BRAIN MOJO THINGY.
perfect.
if YOU NEED TO GO, I UNDERSTAND.
but I CAN'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THIS.
I WANNA HELP YOU. I'M JUST SCARED.
so AM I.
but WE CAN'T LET OUR FEARS STOP US FROM DOING WHAT'S RIGHT.
I KNEW YOU COULDN'T KILL HIM.
I'm SORRY, MATT.
no, STICK TO THE PLAN.
your FEAR IS MAKING ME STRONG, GIRL.
I CAN'T.
no.
No!
stop.
you THINK YOU CAN HOLD ME WITH A POWER?
not ONLY CAN I HOLD YOU, I CAN KILL YOU.
I'm GOING TO DIG INSIDE YOUR HEAD,
find YOUR WORST FEAR, AND MAKE IT EAT YOU ALIVE.
I'm NOT THE ONE THAT'S SCARED.
you ARE.
and YOUR FEAR JUST MAKES ME STRONG.
that WAS AMAZING.
Yeah, WELL YOU KNOW,
I GOT INSIDE HIS HEAD WITH MY BRAIN MOJO THINGY.
my DAD COULD DO THE SAME THING.
now THAT THEY THINK THAT WE'RE DEAD,
we HAVE TIME TO GET AWAY.
no.
I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT RUNNING.
what ARE YOU GOING TO DO, MATT?
fight THEM?
trick THEM INTO KILLING EACH OTHER?
that's NOT GOING TO BRING YOUR DAD BACK.
but IT WILL PROBABLY GET YOU KILLED.
I'm A COP.
stopping GUYS LIKE KNOX, THAT'S WHAT I DO.
you CAN'T BRING THEM DOWN BY YOURSELF.
there's NO WAY.
even WITH ME AT YOUR BACK, WE STILL NEED HELP.
there's A COMPANY, PRIMATECH.
they KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.
if ANYBODY CAN HELP, THEY CAN.
building SEALED UP TIGHT.
if PETER'S STILL HERE, HE AIN'T GETTING OUT.
Peter's LONG GONE.
if I FIND HIM, DO YOU WANT HIM CRISPY OR WELL-DONE?
alive, PLEASE.
I SENT SOMEBODY TO RECRUIT YOU,
when YOU REFUSED HER OFFER, I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU HERE.
my MOTHER'S IN A COMA. DID YOU DO THAT?
Angela's NOT THE WOMAN YOU THINK SHE IS, GABRIEL.
she's DONE TERRIBLE THINGS.
so HAVE I, AND I'M GOING TO DO THEM ALL TO YOU.
has ANGELA FORGIVEN YOUR SINS?
my MOTHER ACCEPTS ME FOR WHO I AM.
I WONDER IF YOU'LL BE SO GENEROUS.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
she SENT YOU HERE, DIDN'T SHE?
to SAVE HER FAVORITE SON.
did SHE TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE ALL GOING TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER?
she's USING YOU, SON, AS A WEAPON.
a BLUNT INSTRUMENT TO BE MANIPULATED AND THEN DISCARDED.
my MOTHER LOVES ME.
when YOU WERE BORN, SHE HAD ONE OF HER DREAMS.
a VISION OF THE FUTURE.
she SAW WHAT YOU WOULD BECOME...
Yeah, I KNOW THIS.
she TOLD ME I'D BECOME A HERO.
did SHE?
angela WAS SO TERRIFIED OF WHAT SHE SAW,
so FRIGHTENED OF HER OWN FLESH AND BLOOD,
that SHE TRIED TO KILL YOU.
imagine THAT, A MOTHER WANTING TO MURDER HER OWN CHILD.
I GOT TO THE BATHROOM JUST IN TIME.
she WAS HOLDING YOU AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TUB.
it's TIME YOU LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.
that's...
far ENOUGH.
I WAS TOLD YOU WERE LEAVING.
maybe ONE DAY I COULD FORGIVE YOU,
but AFTER EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,
I JUST... I DON'T THINK I COULD EVER TRUST YOU.
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE,
but I WAS TRYING TO HELP.
my FEELINGS FOR YOU WERE REAL.
those FEELINGS ARE STILL THERE.
what YOU DID IN MY NAME WAS WRONG.
I WISH I COULD TAKE IT ALL BACK.
I've DONE BAD THINGS, KILLED PEOPLE...
not BY CHOICE, BUT STILL...
I DID THEM.
I NEED TO MAKE AMENDS.
and SO DO YOU.
get WELL, MOHINDER.
Ah! HOLD ON.
we're ALMOST THERE. YOU ALL RIGHT?
thank YOU.
for WHAT?
for HELPING ME.
I've BEEN NOTHING BUT A BITCH.
and YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT SWEET.
really JUST MAKES ME HATE YOU MORE.
no, I SHOULD BE THE ONE THANKING YOU.
Why?
because I WAS READY TO GIVE UP.
stay HOME, DENY EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO ME.
I WAS SCARED.
scared OF WHAT?
what I WOULD FIND OUT ABOUT WHO I REALLY AM.
it's JUST...
it's NICE TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE AS MESSED UP AS I AM.
Peter, YOU STAYED?
I WASN'T GOING TO LEAVE YOU.
what ARE YOU DOING SITTING HERE?
did HE TAKE YOUR POWERS?
no, HE TOLD ME THE TRUTH.
you CAN'T LISTEN TO HIM.
but HE'S OUR FATHER.
he's MY FATHER. I GREW UP WITH HIM.
Oh, AND I DIDN'T, SO I DON'T GET THE RIGHT TO KNOW HIM.
is THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
he CAN'T BE TRUSTED.
you've SEEN WHAT HE'S DONE.
he HURT MOM.
he's MANIPULATED ABILITIES,
I KNOW WHERE THAT LEADS.
the WORLD YOU SAW DOESN'T EXIST.
we WON'T LET IT.
I'm SORRY, PETER, THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO.
you HELP HIM, AND YOU'RE PROVING ALL THE WORST THINGS I'VE EVER SAID ABOUT YOU.
just KICK HIS ASS AND LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
Oh, MY GOD, PETER!
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
why ARE YOU BLEEDING?
he's NOT HEALING.
he TOOK MY ABILITY. WE NEED TO GO.
Elle, HELP ME GET HIM IN THE CAR.
did YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID?
that THEY TOOK HIS ABILITY.
that's WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR.
you DON'T KNOW..
I'm SORRY, CLAIRE.
if YOU CAN'T HEAL,
how DID YOU FALL THAT FAR AND NOT DIE?
I DON'T KNOW.
okay, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
she's THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER OF YOUR ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHTER,
and HE'S HER ADOPTED FATHER.
that SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.
did SURESH INJECT YOU WITH ANYTHING?
Yeah, A TRANQUILIZER, WHY?
what's HE DOING IN THERE?
building A NEST.
laying EGGS. WHO THE HELL KNOWS?
you're BOTH GOING TO HAVE TO COME INTO THE COMPANY TO BE TESTED. FOR WHAT?
just TO BE SURE YOU'RE STILL NORMAL.
so YOU'RE WORKING WITH HIM?
for NOW.
excuse ME.
I'd WATCH OUT FOR THAT ONE.
Oh, WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.
slow DOWN, SLOW DOWN.
where ARE YOU?
no, I WON'T TELL ANYONE.
Peter's NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP, YOU KNOW.
I WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS OF A PETRELLI.
revenge IS IN OUR BLOOD.
we're JUST GONNA WAIT FOR HIM TOOME AFTER US.
no, SON.
we're GOING TO TAKE OUR FIGHT TO THE ENEMY.
how DO YOU SUPPOSE PETER SURVIVED THAT FALL?
seven STORIES WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO HEAL.
hell OF A THING.
I DON'T KNOW.
Hello?
it WORKED.
he THINKS I'M ON HIS SIDE.
good JOB.
if HE REACHES OUT TO PRIMATECH,
I'll LET YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.
screw THIS UP,
and I'LL PUT YOU RIGHT BACK WHERE I FOUND YOU.
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT THAT FALL.
how I DIDN'T HIT AS HARD AS I SHOULD HAVE.
what IF SYLAR DIDN'T WANT ME TO DIE?
what IF...
he WANTED TO GET ME OUT OF THERE ALIVE?
by THROWING YOU OUT OF A WINDOW?
no, HE COULD HAVE USED HIS ABILITY TO SLOW ME DOWN.
I'm TELLING YOU HE SAVED MY LIFE, CLAIRE.
it's ALL RIGHT. SHE'S GOOD.
what HAPPENED?
why AREN'T YOU HEALING?
I DON'T HAVE MY POWERS ANYMORE, NATHAN.
dad TOOK 'EM.
dad's DEAD.
he's NOT, HE'S ALIVE.
I WAS THERE, PETE. I SAW IT...
he's ALIVE, NATHAN.
and IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO STOP HIM,
he's GOING TO KILL US ALL.
that's JUST - THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, PETE.
dad DIED OVER A YEAR AGO.
he's THE ONE WHO PUT MOM IN THAT COMA.
Pete, THIS IS OUR DAD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.
believe ME, DADS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM.
where IS HE? STAY AWAY FROM HIM.
he's DANGEROUS, NATHAN.
look WHAT HE DID TO ME.
if OUR FATHER'S ALIVE,
I NEED TO KNOW WHERE HE IS.
what's THE NAME OF THE COMPANY?
pinehearst, THE BIO-TECH FIRM?
no, I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU DO THIS.
trust ME.
please. OKAY.
we'll DO IT YOUR WAY.
there's A LOT OF WAYS TO SHUT PINEHEARST DOWN.
I'll GO CALL SOMEBODY UP FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
we'll GET SOME HELP.
you're NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO A WORD HE JUST SAID, ARE YOU?
Nope,
I'm GOING TO SEE MY FATHER.
how DO YOU KNOW ABOUT PINEHEARST?
I've BEEN TAKING A CONSULTANT FEE FROM THEM FOR OVER A YEAR.
I'm COMING WITH YOU.
I KNOW THE PLAYERS THERE, I CAN OPEN DOORS.
I DON'T NEED ANY DOORS OPENED.
I PLAN ON KICKING THEM DOWN.
is THAT FOOD?
it's A RECIPE.
it's BEEN IN MY FAMILY FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
you REFUSE TO GO BACK IN TIME.
even IF IT MEANS SAVING THE WORLD.
I CANNOT RISK CHANGING HISTORY.
if ONLY THERE IS SOME OTHER WAY OF LEARNING ABOUT MY ENEMIES.
uncovering THEIR WEAK SPOTS, SO I CAN DEFEAT THEM.
for THOUSANDS OF YEARS, MY FAMILY HAVE TAKEN SPIRIT WALKS.
following DESTINY'S PATH INTO THE REALMS OF THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS.
delicious.
spirit WALK SOUNDS MUCH SAFER THAN TIME TRAVELING.
okay...
I'm READY TO BEGIN MY JOURNEY.
how DO I START?
you EAT A DISGUSTING PASTE MADE FROM THE ROOTS OF A TAMBOTI TREE.
and THE DUNG OF HYENA.
and THEN?
you WAIT.
Hiro! Wake up!
you TRICKED HIM.
I WARNED HIM.
if HE DID NOT CHOOSE HIS PATH,
it WOULD BE CHOSEN FOR HIM.
he's GOING TO WAKE UP, RIGHT?
he's GOING TO BE OKAY?
Mmm. Hello, governor.
Really? Is he on now?
there are people
who are frankly stunned by your seemingly meteoric rise.
in the senate less than three months
and already closely allied with the president
on what many people are calling unprecedented access to the average American's most private details.
Steve, I'm just a humble junior senator from New York,
but as chairman of the senate commission
on homeland security, it's my duty
to protect and serve the people of America.
I can assure you, governor,
I don't know any more about this than you do.
trust me, that's ancient history.
I haven't spoken to him in close to two months.
now, if you don't mind,
I do have to get some sleep.
the rumors in Washington are
of frequent private meetings at the White House,
and the question on everyone's mind is
what are you discussing?
well, again, these are matters of national security.
we're protecting the American people
from a very serious threat.
are we talking about terrorism?
let me assure you, the threat is real.
we're not out to alarm the American public,
but it's important that we take precautionary measures.
senator, I don't mean to belabor this,
of course the questions remain: why you?
why now?
well, I'd love to go into specifics with you, Steve,
but these are highly classified discussions.
there are those that fear
that what you're really talking about
is taking away civil liberties,
relaxing FISA policies,
expanding the reach of the PATRIOT Act.
what about that?
anyone who knows my record and my career
will tell you I've devoted my life to protecting people.
as a district attorney in New York,
I was tough on crime.
you want me to beg?
and now I'm continuing that passion with the protection of the entire nation.
well, screw you.
is this about your religious calling?
I don't beg for anyone.
after your assassination attempt,
you made claims that god has a mission for you.
what do you want?
Yes, I stand by those comments. Now more than ever.
cover her hands.
you got her? -Got her.
all right.
all right, we're good.
I'm a god-Fearing man.
I just want what's best for our country.
tell Petrelli we got the first one.
Ando!
breathe.
breathe in.
breathe in.
breathe in.
breathe.
Peter, it's over.
no, I can save him.
it's no use. He's dead.
Hey.
damn it.
I could have saved him.
no, you couldn't.
he bled out in the car.
I should have got to him faster.
he was pinned in there.
so, I should have been stronger.
you can't save everyone.
I should have been stronger.
new York City
well, any favorites yet?
Yeah, I mean, Hamilton, Smith,
Georgetown - -They're all...
the best schools in the country.
getting your GED was the best thing you could have done.
an elite education
is something most people only dream about.
Claire, you're an exceptional young woman,
and you deserve an exceptional education.
if you say so.
are you okay?
look, I appreciate this.
you putting me up and offering to get me into school,
but I don't think I can do this.
your father and I have discussed this at length.
which one?
both of them.
and we all felt that going to college
was the best chance that you would have a normal life.
everyone keeps saying that, but none of us have a chance
at a normal life when he's still out there.
when who's still out there?
[Whispers] Sylar.
Claire, Sylar is dead.
we stood there together
and watched Primatech burn to the ground.
they found dental remains.
I know he's out there, okay?
I can feel it in my gut.
he's killing again,
and my father is trying to hide it from me.
I found an article in his desk
about a man who went missing in Memphis.
they searched his house and found his entire upstairs filled with salt water.
I'm sure there's some explanation.
my dad keeps going away for days at a time,
going on business trips.
it's happening again, and I should be out there
helping to stop it.
Claire, you have got to believe me.
it's over.
all of it.
primatech, the company, Pinehearst.
all of it.
and we all have to accept that.
no.
you're just trying to put me on the bench.
he's out there.
and if I'm the only one who sees that, then fine.
I'll go find him myself.
Baltimore, Maryland
you move, and I shoot. God damn thief.
think you can come into my shop without me hearing you?
Martin?
martin Gray?
do I know you?
did you live at 423 Canmore Street in Queens 27 years ago?
it was snowing.
in the middle of February, you went out for a pack of cigarettes at 10: 00
and never came back.
or so the story goes.
kind of cliché, don't you think?
who are you?
I'm your son.
and I have some questions for you.
Oh, hey. I was just
working?
I got done with all my morning deliveries,
so I thought I'd just come home.
[Chuckling] at 10: 30?
are you spying on me?
maybe.
look, I know I said I wouldn't use my speed,
but do you have any idea how long it takes to get across midtown on a bike?
Yes, and that's sort of the idea.
but I'm all done for the day.
we could go to the zoo or something.
some of us still have to put in a full day.
you know, I could use my ability
to work my way clear to the top of the police force, but do I?
no, 'cause you're a body guard who makes 12 bucks an hour.
at least it's honest work.
when you should be opening your own private detective agency, like you want.
I told you, I can get you the cash.
I'm not gonna use stolen money to open up a business, Daphne.
what's wrong with trying to live like normal people?
it's boring, for one thing.
well, I will take boring any day over this bizarro world that I've been in ever since this whole thing got started.
come on, we talked about putting it all behind us
and just getting everything back to normal.
just...
normal.
okay. Fine, you win.
normal it is.
[Angela, on phone] yes, I know that.
but she has her own ideas, and now she's circling
the building on your whole operation.
she found an article about a guy in Memphis
that your team picked up,
and, uh, she thinks it's Sylar.
you haven't?
well, then I'm sure it's all just her imagination.
what's your point?
no.
well, the point is she's suspicious,
and I can't control her.
that's too bad, mom,
because I was counting on you distracting her.
if she digs, she's gonna start finding things,
and today is crucial.
we have to keep her away from Peter and away from Parkman when we take him down.
mom, you hear me?
I want Claire as far away from all of this as possible.
mom?
I think we have a bigger problem now.
I'm very different person now.
that was a long time ago.
maybe for you.
you said you had questions?
well, ask 'em.
how does a boy
without a father grow up to be a man?
how does he learn to make the hard decisions he's gonna have to make in life - - The ones only a man can teach?
you want an apology, is that it?
you want to hear I'm sorry
for walking out on you and your mother?
I just want the truth.
what about? That your mother was a sick, infantile woman?
or that I made a mistake ever to have a child with her?
let's start there,
because I'm sure as hell not the son of a man who repairs watches and the woman who collected snow globes.
so who am I?
tell me.
you were given to me.
by whom?
a man who needed money.
your mother wanted a baby and couldn't have one.
I wanted out of a loveless marriage
and was too much of a coward.
seemed like the right answer at the time.
who was he?
my brother.
is he still alive?
you're telling the truth.
now please leave.
so, you planning on seeing him?
see who?
your brother. He's in town.
saw him on tv this morning.
Ah, I didn't see that.
I haven't seen him in months.
not really talking at the moment.
huh. Maybe you won't mind me being honest.
he scares the hell out of me.
why is that?
my family's from Iran.
the things he's talking about,
protecting the country from dangerous people,
it's code. It's not very subtle either.
he's talking about people like me.
we're different, so we're scary.
but you wouldn't know anything about that.
believe me, I know more than you think.
Hello? Claire?
Peter, thank god.
Hey, where are you?
I'm in New York. We have to stop them.
stop who?
your mom and Nathan, they're planning something,
something bad.
I thought it was Sylar, but it's them.
what are you talking about?
I don't know. I think they're talking
about rounding up people with abilities.
they already started taking them.
this guy, in Memphis, he disappeared.
look, wait a minute. Slow down.
they were talking on the phone.
your mom, your brother.
they were talking about keeping me out of the way,
so I wouldn't find out.
they're going after Matt Parkman today.
we have to stop them.
okay, look, just take a deep breath, all right?
I have to warn Matt.
I'll go talk to my mom.
when I know something, I'll give you a call, okay?
I'm just going a few blocks. 87th and Madison, please.
Hello, Peter.
Mohinder?
this is a coincidence.
last time I saw you - - I know.
it's been a long time. Keeping out of trouble?
trying to.
although you ever get the feeling
like you're meant to do something extraordinary?
[Chuckles] I used to.
turns out I was mistaken.
seen anyone? -I try not to.
everybody's under the radar.
all except your brother, of course.
well, you know Nathan.
seems like every time I pick up a newspaper
or turn on the tv, there he is,
right out in the open.
he's not wrong, you know.
these powers uncontrolled, unrestricted,
I see only danger in that.
do you?
I was living proof of it.
okay, so what happens when the government wants to step in?
that's a necessary risk I'm willing to accept.
segregation? Internment camps?
people hiding underground?
we'll agree to disagree.
how much do I owe you?
Ah, it's okay. It's on me.
thank you.
take care of yourself, Mohinder.
you too, Peter.
where to, my friend?
just drive.
it's your dime.
who are you... and what do you want?
I want you to get in the van.
you're surrounded.
get in.
you want to live, get in!
what the hell is going on?
those guys who tried to kidnap me.
do you know who they are? - No.
has anybody contacted you about people with abilities
being attacked or abducted? -No.
have you had any contact with Claire?
or Parkman? -No! No!
what did Peter Petrelli tell you today?
how did you know
where did you come from?
what are you doing?!
sorry, Mohinder.
mom?
mom, you home?
she's not here.
it's been a long time, Pete.
sorry I've been out of touch. I've been kind of busy.
Yeah, what with all press you've been doing lately, right?
you know the media,
they like new and shiny.
Yeah, you got the whole country thinking you're talking about terrorists,
but we both know who you're really talking about.
what can I say, Pete? Last time I tried to out us,
I got shot.
I'm nothing if not a quick study.
just gonna round us all up, get rid of us?
let me guess,
you got our mother involved in this, too.
mom's got nothing to do with this, Pete.
it's not dad's plans, it's all me.
you know how I feel about this. We've been over it.
I'm doing what's necessary.
no, what you're doing is turning your back on your own kind.
it's one thing to disown me, Nathan.
but this, you're a self-loathing hypocrite.
and you wonder why I haven't returned your calls?
look, I said some things that were pretty harsh.
I admit it.
I got a little emotional,
but I've had time to calm down and...
I'd like to talk to you about some ideas.
I'd like your input,
Your...advice.
advice?
what advice could I possibly give you
besides kiss my ass, Nathan?
I'm just trying to extend an olive branch here,
that's all.
how about dinner?
tonight?
just dinner.
I'll text you when and where.
okay.
just out of curiosity,
what can you do these days?
do?
your abilities.
what are you, a cop?
what's the last thing you saw me do, Nathan?
you flew.
Hey, how the hell did you get out of your tank?
you're talking to a turtle again.
you again.
how did you get into my apartment?
what are you doing here?
I came to give you a message.
it's kind of a long trip
for a message, don't you think?
I'm not really here, Parkman.
it's an illusion, like life.
it's best not to make this any more difficult
than it has to be.
there are things you'll come to know
along the way in this journey.
no. No, no, no, no.
I've taken way too many journeys already.
I know it's difficult to understand,
but I went through the same thing
when it happened to me.
when what happened to you?
the calling
to be a prophet.
you've been chosen.
no, I didn't ask to be chosen for anything.
all I want to do is live a normal life.
but you're not normal, Parkman,
and you've known that for a while.
the world needs you
to tell them the future. -The future?
how the hell am I gonna do that?
you'll paint it.
I can't even draw!
you'll learn.
uh...
fine, so what am I supposed
Ah, there you are, Ando.
ando, this is Hiro, come in!
I know you are there. Just talk to me
alright, I am sorry I shot you in the arm...
but u will thank me, I promise - No I won't - Ah ha, I knew it would work
where r u?
I am fighting crime...just like you wanted.
you moved!
I am looking at u and the Ando-Cycle right now.
U are not fighting crime.
U are at...
a strip club!
you should be using you powers for good... not to pick up girls.
the Ando-Cycle is a chick magnet.
you have a destiny just as I did.
a sacred duty to use your powers...
to do great things in the world
to fight injustice wherever you find
Hey. What r...? No donot!
Aaah!
Hiro?
Hiro. R u ok?
Hiro. What is going on?
Hiro!
thank god you're okay.
Claire, what are you doing here?
did they come? Did who come?
I don't know, but you're in danger.
I heard Angela and Nathan talking about sending someone to take you down
take me down, huh?
I came to warn you. It's happening again.
Sylar, the company - - They are planning something.
I don't know anything about that,
but something weird is happening to me.
weird like what?
I made these drawings.
except the thing is I don't draw,
or at least I couldn't until now.
what does this have to do with anything?
they're supposed to come true, I think,
but they don't make any sense to me.
is that supposed to be us?
you're right.
that's us, right now.
what is that on your neck?
Oh!
I know we have dinner plans.
there's just some things I need to talk to you about
that can't wait.
okay.
I can only imagine how you feel about me after...Disowning you the way I did.
it was selfish, arrogant...
obsessive.
those are your better qualities, Nathan.
I know it hasn't been easy
losing me as a brother and a friend.
you need to know what I'm doing
is hugely important for this country.
for the world.
I want to give you the chance to understand that before you make a decision that may change your life forever.
I'm not making any decisions.
okay, I'm just trying to live my life as normally as I can.
that's just it, Pete. You're not normal.
Pete, please...
tell me you understand that, so I can make arrangements
and provide you with the protection that you need.
tell me you understand.
why are you asking me this?
what is it that you're looking for me to say?
I'm looking for you to tell me you're with me,
and then I'll leave.
I can't do that.
no, I won't do that.
look, I don't know what you're up to,
but if it is what I think it is,
I'm gonna fight you with every breath that I have. I swear to god.
okay.
Hey, give your big brother a hug?
of course.
I'm sorry, Pete.
don't hurt him.
Hello?
anybody home?
Mr. Gray?
who are you?
I said, who are you?
Simmons.
agent Daniel Simmons.
all right, agent Simmons,
Where's the man that lives in this house?
Where's Mr. Gray? -I don't know.
then we'll ask another question.
I walked into a trap. Who sent you?
a challenge...fine.
I like a challenge.
password...
someone important to me
Kaito...
Kensei.
Ando.
Hiro.
we have a couple of situations.
let me guess... Sylar.
we've lost communication with the team.
I told you to put a bullet in the back of his head.
right here.
the last thing I need is a body count to try and explain.
we're sending a clean-up crew,
but there's something else.
uncuff her.
give us a minute.
[Drugged] I hate you.
I know.
you're never gonna get away with this.
someday you might forgive me, Claire.
someday you might not.
the important thing is that you get home right now
and forget everything you've just seen.
what makes you think I'm gonna do that?
what, are you gonna threaten my family?
Claire, I have given you a free pass.
don't make me change my mind.
no.
where are you taking them?
flight 195. You are cleared for takeoff.
Hiro.
Peter. Peter, it's me.
come on, wake up.
come on, we need to get everyone out of here.
we need to break these shackles.
I don't have strength anymore.
Suresh.
take this stuff off.
Suresh?
come on, wake up.
come on, wake up.
wake everybody up.
go to the cockpit!
we're gonna make an unexpected landing.
Claire?
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday!
den mother 3-1 going down!
bearing two-Four-Five at nine-Eight
off walnut ridge vortac!
we have lost pressure! Mayday, Mayday!
we're gonna make an unexpected landing.
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
den mother 31 going down!
bearing 2-4-5 at 9-8.
off walnut ridge vortac.
we have lost pressure. Mayday, may--!
did I wake you?
no, not yet.
well, it's not good.
Claire got on board somehow, and all hell broke loose.
no, the pilot managed an emergency landing, but...
the plane broke apart when it hit the ground.
some of the prisoners escaped.
Charpter two Trust and blood
stop!
wait!
quiet. - Parkman?
Hiro, how did you get here?
did you get your powers back?
no, I am powerless.
the hero's path is never easy.
if we stay here, we're dead. We have to keep moving.
Yes! Save the others.
where are they?
I saw them running. Peter Petrelli, the cheerleader.
it is our duty to save them!
don't you get it? Powers alone aren't gonna cut it with these guys.
they were ready for us.
all of us. - Then what do we do?
the sun will be up soon.
it seems like there's more trees and cover that way. Come on.
where are you going?
I can't believe this is happening.
my father, your brother.
it's not just nathan. He's got the whole government. We need to hide. Come on.
I can't let you do that, sweetheart!
you both need to come with me. - Oh, let me go!
let me go. This is insane!
what happened to you? How could you be a part of this?
it's much more complicated than you know.
you gonna shoot me, Bennet?
in front of your daughter?
dad.
what are you doing?
I got three on the hill.
run, Peter.
you're never gonna get away with this.
the crash-- people are gonna ask questions.
you're wrong.
nobody's gonna know a thing.
what did you do?
I got to the site as soon as I heard.
it was a nightmare.
it's totally out of control.
it wasn't just the crash.
Danko, he was in my face from the second I hit the ground.
why the hell did you authorize an air strike?
it's the standing protocol, senator. - I don't need your permission.
permission?
this is my operation.
not out here it isn't. I've got civilians at risk.
the second that crash happened, your prisoners were redesignated "terrorists."
you mean targets?
shoot to kill? That's your tactical, elegant solution?
these people of yours are dangerous.
these people are going into custody.
we're not assassins.
you have a rabid dog, you don't put a chain around its neck and pray for miracles.
you put it down.
when did the rules of engagement change?
this isn't some exercise in tactics, senator.
your daughter turned a simple transport flight into a national security emergency.
I'll deal with Claire.
you do that.
and I'll do my job.
Tracy, come on. We gotta keep moving.
I can't do this.
what are you talking about?
I'm not some thing.
my life was finally getting back to normal.
okay, stop, stop.
you stay here, And they will catch you.
now come on.
Why?
why would Nathan do this to us?
I don't know.
but I'm gonna find a way to stop him.
this is a nightmare. - Okay, you stay here, and he wins.
you come with me, and you can fight.
come on.
maybe these people can help us.
what is he doing? We're not thieves.
the trance is compelling him. Let's just let him go.
what should we do?
come on.
focus, Parkman.
put these on.
we need to blend in.
I'll take their address. Send money later.
nemesis. - It's me.
how did you find me?
Hiro told me about your "super secret" hideout.
of course. Best way to keep a secret: tell everyone.
is something wrong?
it's Matt.
he didn't come home last night. He didn't call.
he always calls.
I didn't know who else to turn to.
wait. Hiro's missing also. He's kidnapped.
maybe same thing happen to Matt.
I've got to find him.
I think he was taken to Arkansas.
how do you know that?
because hiro and I have GPS trackers.
of course you do.
he's near Russellville, Arkansas. I was trying to buy a ticket to fly there.
why fly when you can run?
you lost your ability? How?
it is complicated.
and unfortunate.
from what I've heard, it would have been quite useful today.
it wasn't my fault. Now even Ando has a power.
he has no idea how to be a hero.
well, then your friend Ando should stay as far away from here as possible.
and so should you.
you think I should leave?
find a policeman and turn yourself in.
no. I must help my friends.
it is my duty.
not anymore.
if you tell them your powers are gone,
they may let you go.
surrender?
never. I am a warrior.
this is not your fight anymore, Hiro.
save yourself.
while you still can.
when did you learn to draw?
I didn't. It just happened.
well, do you have any idea what they mean?
nemesis?
no...
that's Daphne at the crash site.
Matt, that's not possible. She wasn't even on the plane.
this is India? - You're right. Right, this is nuts.
I don't want this.
Matt, they will find us here. We have to go.
no, I...
if these visions are real, and Daphne's in trouble.
I gotta get back.
that's insane. Those men'll kill you!
I'm not gonna leave her!
taxidermy.
never really liked that old man.
that's right. Take a good look.
cause that's your future if you keep getting into fights at school.
I just hope a night in juvy taught you something.
Yup. Food's great.
don't push it, Luke.
not after yesterday.
just tell me why. Why'd you have to hit that kid?
what's that mean?
what the hell's wrong with you?
a shrug.
is that your answer for everything?
he called you a whore.
get inside.
authorities are still not confirming reports that an aircraft came down last night in rural Arkansas.
I can't believe I left that on.
...military aircraft or cargo jet plummet rapidly across the sky...
call the police.
...saying that there were no scheduled flights in the area.
several eyewitnesses claim to have seen...
national guard training exercise in the area...
you're either Mary Campbell or "current occupant."
we've been waiting for you.
who are you? What are you doing here?
special agent Simmons says hello.
his people trained him very well.
he hardly flinched at all when he lost a finger or two.
trouble is he has information that I need,
so you are gonna help me loosen his tongue.
sick freak.
you're gonna torture me in front of them?
no.
I'm gonna torture them
in front of you.
Oh. Arkansas.
Hey, thank you for doing this.
don't thank me yet.
soldiers.
Hey, is that the cheerleader?
Hiro.
hang on.
you're supposed to kill Hiro in the future, right?
Yeah. - Well, then he can't be dead.
and if he's okay, maybe Matt's okay too.
Yeah, we must be sneaky when we look for them.
Yeah.
that's why you're staying here.
right. Wait, what?
wait!
so Hiro's alive because I kill him?
that's right. I kill him.
Yes, he's alive.
Roger that, base. Lost agent marquette...
wait, wait, I got a man down.
man down.
nice.
what are you doing?
I'm gonna go back. Find Nathan.
disguised as a guard? Where'd you see that? An old movie?
they saw you on the plane. I don't care how many powers you had.
one.
I don't know why. I can only hang on to one at a time.
if I pick up a new one, I lose the old one.
you're gonna go up against all of 'em?
you don't even know if Nathan's here.
Oh, Nathan's here. He's probably sweating bullets.
trying not to show it.
this whole program was his idea.
it means that his ass is on the line.
you go back, they'll kill you.
you got a better idea?
maybe.
I know Nathan too, and not like a brother.
I know the way he thinks.
it's 'cause you slept with him.
and I think the same way.
what are you doing here, dad? - Doing my job.
you still haven't told me how you were on that plane, Claire.
I was grabbed by your goon squad.
dad number two tried to send me home, but I don't walk out on my friends
or help people sick enough to do something like this.
you have no idea how big this mission is
and what these people will do once you're on their radar.
don't.
I'm not gonna be your excuse anymore.
you know these guys.
Hiro Nakamura. Of all people, you chain them up like animals.
I have made certain arrangements,
arrangements which will guarantee your safety and the safety of this family,
but these abilities have got to be controlled.
I have an ability.
does that mean that I have to be controlled?
no, Claire, you're missing.
I'm one of them.
and so is he. - Transportation's set.
young lady, you're headed back to costa verde.
so that's it? I just dance away to college,
pretend everything's all hunky-dory?
something like that, yeah.
so I get a pass.
and everyone I know just disappears.
except for senator Skyboy, of course,
because he's got everything under control.
I'm walking a fine line here.
balancing the security of this country ...
stop. - Against a serious threat.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
either one of you.
stay put for just a minute.
we talked about this when I came on board.
and I will take orders, and I will do what has to be done,
but you gotta put A leash on your hunter.
I haven't forgotten what we've discussed.
don't worry about him. He's useful.
until he's not.
damn it!
I want her found.
don't forget our arrangement. Keep her out of this.
you keep her out of this.
daughter or not, she is running out of favors.
I wouldn't let anything happen to her.
what would your hunter do if he knew you were one of them too?
my mistake?
that I expected my people to act responsibly?
nobody could have anticipated what happened on that hillside.
wait, Matt! We can't go down there.
this is the place from the drawing, I know it.
this is where she gets shot.
Matt. - Ando!
how'd you get here? - The speedster brought me.
we're looking for you And Hiro.
she was here.
Hey.
Oh, good.
Ando. - Hiro.
something brought them together at the crash site.
I mean, I imagine some of them had the misguided idea
that they could still stop this whole thing.
guys. We really gotta get outta here.
she's right. We gotta move.
I can't carry all these people at once.
you don't worry. I'm just gonna do a quick recon.
find the safest way--- Daphne!
danko's men totally overreacted.
run! Go!
once they opened fire, they were all out for blood.
when they went after Claire, that's when I knew Danko had lost control.
No!
Parkman must have got inside the shooter's head.
forced him to turn on his own men.
it became a bloodbath.
agent Simmons.
seems fatigued.
you really need to pay attention.
your father's in custody, you sick piece of crap.
another lie. Well, it's time to get started.
where to begin?
mommy.
why are you doing this?
what did we ever do to you?
nothing.
wrong place, wrong time. I could have been a flood or a tornado.
there's really no difference, actually.
how about you, Luke?
any thoughts?
Oh, I sense some dysfunction in the Campbell household.
you bastard, you better leave him.
but I understand.
single mom, troubled teenage son, and judging from that pathetic alimony check I found,
I'd say dad took off quite some time ago.
Mm!
what are you doing to her?
only what you wished you could have done years ago.
you're lying.
agent Simmons, Mary is losing her patience.
isn't it your job to protect her from monsters like me?
he's not going to talk. Let her go.
you said that 'cause you care, kid?
or is that just a preconditioned response 'cause mommy drew the short straw?
what do you know about me?
mom's a drone, and dad abandoned you. I know that rage, Luke.
and I know that deep down, you'd like nothing more than to see her blood
all over the living room floor.
go to hell!
well, well.
it's a small world.
you and I really need to talk.
so many good men, devoted soldiers, all dead.
I don't care who your daddy is. This is your fault.
my fault?
you're the ones who started it. You hunted us.
I read your file, Cheerleader.
I know how you heal.
like that sylar.
I'm nothing like him.
one shot to the back of the head.
that's all it takes.
I told you to stay away from my daughter.
get her outta here.
I'll take her home.
he would have done it.
he would have pulled the trigger.
in a heartbeat. Once they target you, they won't stop.
they'll go after me, your mom, Lyle,
whatever it takes to bring you down.
what are we gonna do?
right now...
nothing.
go home.
live that normal life you always said you wanted.
what about Peter?
the others?
I'll do what I can.
come on.
how many more casualties are we gonna take before you get it?
I thought I told you to stand down.
you've been giving a lot of orders today, senator.
is there something you'd like to talk to me about?
how'd you think this was gonna go?
that these people of yours would lie down? Give up?
treat us as liberators?
right now, you're the president's golden boy.
the downside is, it goes south,
you can kiss your political career good-bye.
go back to playing house in your mama's mansion.
we're all replaceable.
some of us more than others.
excuse me.
Nathan, it's me.
one second.
you're calling the shots. For now.
and I'll clean up your mess this time, but if your affection for these animals costs me any more men. They're not animals.
people. Say it with me.
I don't want to have to tell you again.
Tracy. - I heard.
so that's the kind of killer that you're working with now?
you need to give yourself up now.
I can promise you won't get hurt.
your promises haven't been worth much lately.
you'll have to do better. - This isn't a negotiation.
you don't have anything I want.
I have Peter.
okay, I'm listening.
I want my old life back.
I give you Peter, my part in this gets written off as never happened.
I go back to my apple martinis and overpaid lobbyists.
how do you want to do this?
mile marker 47.
there's an old historical site near the road.
three hours.
and come alone. If I even see one pair of boots...
no tricks.
you can trust me, Tracy.
he's on his way.
show me.
some stuff melts. Some burns.
water boils. Kinda like a microwave.
that's very impressive.
you should see what happens around pacemakers.
you know, I heard you at the door.
that kid you hit at school, he didn't call your mother a whore; you lied.
you do that a lot.
why do you care?
because you live a half a block down from my father.
if that's a coincidence, God's improved his sense of humor.
you're wrong.
I'm no one.
I'm not. I don't have any friends.
shoplift crap I don't even want. Sell my ritalin to meth mouths at school.
no, no, don't worry.
he's lying. At least, about the drugs.
she hates me, you know.
no. I don't.
well, I don't even need an ability to know that that's a lie.
she can see it in you, Luke.
what you can do.
no, she doesn't know about it.
I'm not talking about the power.
I'm talking about you.
this is what scares them, what's in here.
the will.
I love my son.
I just want him to be happy.
well, he's not.
you lie, Luke, because you'd rather be anyone else other than yourself.
that's why you got into that fight.
that kid could be dead with your ability, and the only reason he's alive is cause of your kindness, and that scares you.
I want you to tell me about this power and everything you know about the man down the street.
wait.
stop. - Aah!
no, Luke, stop!
stop it! Luke, stop!
you killed him!
he was gonna--- he was gonna save us!
Hey, take me with you.
what, did you hear me? And so what? - Yes.
so you just killed the one shot I had at finding my old man.
he was gonna shoot you in the head. I mean, I coulda just let him.
and I let you live.
which is kind of a big deal for me.
I could tell you more about your father.
Yeah, so could a milk carton. I'm not that interested.
look, I can't stay here.
with her. With this. I mean,
you're the only one who understands what it's like. I know where he is.
well, you're not lying, which only means you think you can find him.
and I know why you're looking for him.
tell me.
because you're just like me,
trying to figure out why you are the way you are.
and in this whole hellish world, your dad might be the only answer.
you take me with you, I'll walk you right up his driveway.
does your mother have a car?
not anymore.
what do I do if something goes wrong?
I'll be right here.
get close to him, okay? Use your powers.
God, what if I kill him? - You're not going to.
just disable him.
we get him, we use him as leverage against the government.
look, he's not my brother anymore, Tracy,
and he's not your boyfriend.
you understand?
Yeah. - Go.
I came alone.
just like you asked.
Where's Peter?
I've got him.
I told him that you offered us amnesty.
he'll come out when he knows he's safe.
it's like I told you. You deliver me Peter,
I give you your life back.
you'll be surrounded by your friends, you can play house with the governor, and nobody gets hurt.
you must know I'd assume this was a trap.
but i came anyway, Tracy, for you.
and the offer still stands. You deliver me Peter,
you get to go free.
you're serious?
Tracy, I am not the devil you think I am.
someone like you I can trust.
you and I, we think alike. Peter's...
he's unpredictable.
he's got it in his head, he's gonna save the world, and that is not how it's gonna end.
he is gonna end up getting all of you killed.
all of you.
what are you saying To her, Nathan?
what, are you telling her that I'm unstable? Crazed?
you lock me up,
you fix everything, you call off your dogs.
I got Peter. You take the girl.
you said you were alone.
I know.
how many times are we gonna do this?
as many times as it takes.
do it. Take the shot.
I don't have it. - Back 'em off.
I can't do that. - Back them off.
it's over, Pete. Give up.
take the shot.
no, this is the beginning.
take the damn shot.
take her.
Nathan, don't do this!
get your hands off of me! No!
look at me!
don't do this!
what the hell was that? - I told you I didn't have it.
I saw it.
Yes, I did.
thank you.
you know me.
you know I didn't want any of this.
containment, protecting them from themselves, that was always my goal.
now Peter's loose, Parkman, the others.
both sides have tasted blood. The next move is theirs.
thank you. I will send money for gas.
toss your cell phones.
this is the last time we get together using these things.
we find each other, so can they.
I figure we have 15 minutes.
understood. You need to see these.
Where'd you get these? - Matt.
he drew them right after the crash.
he has Isaac's gift.
I recognize this building. It's the divya velukkai in New Delhi.
India?
the warrior must have his sword. I must regain my powers.
help defeat this menace.
it is my destiny to go there.
it is?
then perhaps it's ours to seek justice.
I don't want it.
what they're doing to us isn't justice.
it's just stupid. It's blind fear.
well, if you don't want to see them punished, what do you want?
I want 'em to pay. For Daphne.
Matt, that's not us. That's not you.
let's get one thing straight.
our lives as we knew them are over.
we can't go back to anything that we knew.
then what do we do?
we bring the fight to them, - with everything we got. - It won't be easy.
credit cards, bank accounts, they're gone.
homes are gonna be watched. Can't trust the phones.
we gotta find a way to defend ourselves.
we leave everything.
we do what it takes to survive.
things we can't even imagine.
remember, they're gonna come for us.
and when that day comes, we have to be ready.
you've been awfully quiet since you got back.
just tired.
it was a hard trip.
I bet.
two days of scouting colleges, all those sorority mixers.
your dad said you begged him to stay another day.
so, any decisions?
I just, um...
I was thinking of maybe staying close to home for a while.
getting a part-time job.
Oh, my god.
I would love that.
I really missed you.
the house would be empty without you.
Claire's home she's safe. We both know Peter.
sooner or later, he's gonna come to you.
when he does...
can I count on you to do the right thing?
that's not why you called, Nathan. I can hear it in your voice.
you suddenly see how this could all end badly,
and you're looking for reassurance.
maybe even absolution.
but I'm not giving it.
you pushed me aside and went to the president.
because you thought your team could handle this.
and I suggest you do exactly that.
they're ready for you, sir.
God.
get me out of this. - Can't do that.
Why? - It's too late.
why are you doing this?
what I have come to realize is that these powers just lead to chaos.
good people, through no fault of their own, cannot control it.
it just leads to disaster.
you son of a bitch.
maybe that's what you tell yourself so that you can sleep at night.
but this is about you.
your ambition.
it's all you are, Nathan.
it's all you ever were.
try not to fight it. It'll be easier.
you're one of us.
you're one of us, Nathan!
hold her down. - You're one of us, Nathan!
you're one of us, Nathan! You're one of us!
we're gonna make an unexpected landing.
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
den mother 31 going down!
bearing 2-4-5 At 9-8
off walnut ridge vortac.
we have lost pressure. Mayday, may--!
did I wake you?
no, not yet.
well, it's not good.
Claire got on board somehow, and all hell broke loose.
no, the pilot managed an emergency landing, but...
the plane broke apart when it hit the ground.
some of the prisoners escaped.
Charpter two Trust and blood
stop!
wait!
quiet. - parkman?
Hiro, how did you get here?
did you get your powers back?
no, I am powerless.
the hero's path is never easy.
if we stay here, we're dead. We have to keep moving.
Yes! Save the others.
where are they?
I saw them running. Peter Petrelli, the cheerleader.
it is our duty to save them!
don't you get it? Powers alone aren't gonna cut it with these guys.
they were ready for us.
all of us. - Then what do we do?
the sun will be up soon.
it seems like there's more trees and cover that way. Come on.
where are you going?
I can't believe this is happening.
my father, your brother.
it's not just Nathan. He's got the whole government. We need to hide. Come on.
I can't let you do that, sweetheart!
you both need to come with me. - Oh, let me go!
let me go. This is insane!
what happened to you? How could you be a part of this?
it's much more complicated than you know.
you gonna shoot me, Bennet?
in front of your daughter?
dad.
what are you doing?
I got three on the hill.
run, Peter.
you're never gonna get away with this.
the crash -- People are gonna ask questions.
you're wrong.
nobody's gonna know a thing.
what did you do?
I got to the site as soon as I heard.
it was a nightmare.
it's totally out of control.
it wasn't just the crash.
Danko, he was in my face from the second I hit the ground.
why the hell did you authorize an air strike?
it's the standing protocol, senator. - I don't need your permission.
permission?
this is my operation.
not out here it isn't. I've got civilians at risk.
the second that crash happened, your prisoners were redesignated "terrorists."
you mean targets?
shoot to kill? That's your tactical, elegant solution?
these people of yours are dangerous.
these people are going into custody.
we're not assassins.
you have a rabid dog, you don't put a chain around its neck and pray for miracles.
you put it down.
when did the rules of engagement change?
this isn't some exercise in tactics, senator.
your daughter turned a simple transport flight into a national security emergency.
I'll deal with Claire.
you do that.
and I'll do my job.
Tracy, come on. We gotta keep moving.
I can't do this.
what are you talking about?
I'm not some thing.
my life was finally getting back to normal.
okay, stop, stop.
you stay here, and they will catch you.
now come on.
Why?
why would Nathan do this to us?
I don't know.
but I'm gonna find a way to stop him.
this is a nightmare. - Okay, you stay here, and he wins.
you come with me, and you can fight.
come on.
maybe these people can help us.
what is he doing? We're not thieves.
the trance is compelling him. Let's just let him go.
what should we do?
come on.
focus, Parkman.
put these on.
we need to blend in.
I'll take their address. Send money later.
nemesis. - It's me.
how did you find me?
Hiro told me about your "super secret" hideout.
of course. Best way to keep a secret: tell everyone.
is something wrong?
it's Matt.
he didn't come home last night. He didn't call.
he always calls.
I didn't know who else to turn to.
wait. Hiro's missing also. He's kidnapped.
maybe same thing happen to matt.
I've got to find him.
I think he was taken to Arkansas.
how do you know that?
because Hiro and I have GPS trackers.
of course you do.
he's near Russellville, Arkansas. I was trying to buy a ticket to fly there.
why fly when you can run?
you lost your ability? How?
it is complicated.
and unfortunate.
from what I've heard, it would have been quite useful today.
it wasn't my fault. Now even Ando has a power.
he has no idea how to be a hero.
well, then your friend Ando should stay as far away from here as possible.
and so should you.
you think I should leave?
find a policeman and turn yourself in.
no. I must help my friends.
it is my duty.
not anymore.
if you tell them your powers are gone,
they may let you go.
surrender?
never. I am a warrior.
this is not your fight anymore, Hiro.
save yourself.
while you still can.
when did you learn to draw?
I didn't. It just happened.
well, do you have any idea what they mean?
nemesis?
no...
that's Daphne at the crash site.
Matt, that's not possible. She wasn't even on the plane.
this is India? - You're right. Right, this is nuts.
I don't want this.
Matt, they will find us here. We have to go.
no, I...
if these visions are real, and Daphne's in trouble.
I gotta get back.
that's insane. Those men'll kill you!
I'm not gonna leave her!
taxidermy.
never really liked that old man.
that's right. Take a good look.
cause that's your future if you keep getting into fights at school.
I just hope a night In juvy taught you something.
Yup. Food's great.
don't push it, Luke.
not after yesterday.
just tell me why. Why'd you have to hit that kid?
what's that mean?
what the hell's wrong with you?
a shrug.
is that your answer for everything?
he called you a whore.
get inside.
authorities are still not confirming reports that an aircraft came down last night in rural Arkansas.
I can't believe I left that on.
...military aircraft or cargo jet plummet rapidly across the sky...
call the police.
...saying that there were no scheduled flights in the area.
several eyewitnesses claim to have seen...national guard training exercise in the area...
you're either Mary campbell or "current occupant."
we've been waiting for you.
who are you? What are you doing here?
special agent Simmons says hello.
his people trained him very well.
he hardly flinched at all when he lost a finger or two.
trouble is he has information that I need,
so you are gonna help me loosen his tongue.
sick freak.
you're gonna torture me in front of them?
no.
I'm gonna torture them
in front of you.
Oh. Arkansas.
Hey, thank you for doing this.
don't thank me yet.
soldiers.
Hey, is that the cheerleader?
Hiro.
hang on.
you're supposed to kill Hiro in the future, right?
Yeah. - Well, then he can't be dead.
and if he's okay, maybe Matt's okay too.
Yeah, we must be sneaky when we look for them.
Yeah.
that's why you're staying here.
right. Wait, what?
wait!
so Hiro's alive because I kill him?
that's right. I kill him.
Yes, he's alive.
Roger that, base. Lost agent Marquette...
wait, wait, I got a man down.
man down.
nice.
what are you doing?
I'm gonna go back. Find Nathan.
disguised as a guard? Where'd you see that? An old movie?
they saw you on the plane. I don't care how many powers you had.
one.
I don't know why. I can only hang on to one at a time.
if I pick up a new one, I lose the old one.
you're gonna go up against all of 'em?
you don't even know If Nathan's here.
Oh, Nathan's here. He's probably sweating bullets.
trying not to show it.
this whole program was his idea.
it means that his ass is on the line.
you go back, they'll kill you.
you got a better idea?
maybe.
I know Nathan too, and not like a brother.
I know the way he thinks.
it's 'cause you slept with him.
and I think the same way.
what are you doing here, dad? - Doing my job.
you still haven't told me how you were on that plane, Claire.
I was grabbed by your goon squad.
dad number two tried to send me home, but I don't walk out on my friends.
or help people sick enough to do something like this.
you have no idea how big this mission is
and what these people will do once you're on their radar.
don't.
I'm not gonna be your excuse anymore.
you know these guys.
Hiro Nakamura. Of all people, you chain them up like animals.
I have made certain arrangements,
arrangements which will guarantee your safety and the safety of this family,
but these abilities have got to be controlled.
I have an ability.
does that mean that I have to be controlled?
no, Claire, you're missing
I'm one of them.
and so is he. - Transportation's set.
young lady, you're headed back to Costa Verde.
so that's it? I just dance away to college,
pretend everything's all hunky-dory?
something like that, yeah.
so I get a pass.
and everyone I know just disappears.
except for senator Skyboy, of course,
because he's got everything under control.
I'm walking a fine line here.
balancing the security of this country ...
stop. - Against a serious threat.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
either one of you.
stay put for just a minute.
we talked about this when I came on board.
and I will take orders, and I will do what has to be done,
but you gotta put a leash on your hunter.
I haven't forgotten what we've discussed.
don't worry about him. He's useful.
until he's not.
damn it!
I want her found.
don't forget our arrangement. Keep her out of this.
you keep her out of this.
daughter or not, she is running out of favors.
I wouldn't let anything happen to her.
what would your hunter do if he knew you were one of them too?
my mistake?
that I expected my people to act responsibly?
nobody could have anticipated what happened on that hillside.
wait, Matt! We can't go down there.
this is the place from the drawing, I know it.
this is where she gets shot.
Matt. - Ando!
how'd you get here? - The speedster brought me.
we're looking for you and Hiro.
she was here.
Hey.
Oh, good.
Ando. - Hiro.
something brought them together at the crash site.
I mean, I imagine some of them had the misguided idea
that they could still stop this whole thing.
guys. We really gotta get outta here.
she's right. We gotta move.
I can't carry all these people at once.
you don't worry. I'm just gonna do a quick recon.
find the safest way-- - Daphne!
danko's men totally overreacted.
run! Go!
once they opened fire, they were all out for blood.
when they went after Claire, that's when I knew Danko had lost control.
No!
Parkman must have got inside the shooter's head.
forced him to turn on his own men.
it became a bloodbath.
agent Simmons.
seems fatigued.
you really need to pay attention.
your father's in custody, you sick piece of crap.
another lie. Well, it's time to get started.
where to begin?
mommy.
why are you doing this?
what did we ever do to you?
nothing.
wrong place, wrong time. I could have been a flood or a tornado.
there's really no difference, actually.
how about you, Luke?
any thoughts?
Oh, I sense some dysfunction in the campbell household.
you bastard, you better leave him
but I understand.
single mom, troubled teenage son, and judging from that pathetic alimony check I found,
I'd say dad took off quite some time ago.
Mm!
what are you doing to her?
only what you wished you could have done years ago.
you're lying.
agent Simmons, Mary is losing her patience.
isn't it your job to protect her from monsters like me?
he's not going to talk. Let her go.
you said that 'cause you care, kid?
or is that just a preconditioned response 'cause mommy drew the short straw?
what do you know about me?
mom's a drone, and dad abandoned you. I know that rage, Luke.
and I know that deep down, you'd like nothing more than to see her blood
all over the living room floor.
go to hell!
well, well.
it's a small world.
you and I really need to talk.
so many good men, devoted soldiers, all dead.
I don't care who your daddy is. This is your fault.
my fault?
you're the ones who started it. You hunted us.
I read your file, cheerleader.
I know how you heal.
like that Sylar.
I'm nothing like him.
one shot to the back of the head.
that's all it takes.
I told you to stay away from my daughter.
get her outta here.
I'll take her home.
he would have done it.
he would have pulled the trigger.
in a heartbeat. Once they target you, they won't stop.
they'll go after me, your mom, Lyle,
whatever it takes to bring you down.
what are we gonna do?
right now...
nothing.
go home.
live that normal life you always said you wanted.
what about Peter?
the others?
I'll do what I can.
come on.
how many more casualties are we gonna take before you get it?
I thought I told you to stand down.
you've been giving a lot of orders today, senator.
is there something you'd like to talk to me about?
how'd you think this was gonna go?
that these people of yours would lie down? Give up?
treat us as liberators?
right now, you're the president's golden boy.
you pull this off, you can write your own ticket.
the downside is, it goes south,
you can kiss your political career good-bye.
go back to playing house in your mama's mansion.
we're all replaceable.
some of us more than others.
excuse me.
Nathan, it's me.
one second.
you're calling the shots. For now.
and I'll clean up your mess this time, but if your affection for these animals costs me any more men. They're not animals.
people. Say it with me.
I don't want to have to tell you again.
Tracy. - I heard.
so that's the kind of killer that you're working with now?
you need to give yourself up now.
I can promise you won't get hurt.
your promises haven't been worth much lately.
you'll have to do better. - This isn't a negotiation.
you don't have anything I want.
I have Peter.
okay, I'm listening.
I want my old life back.
I give you Peter, my part in this gets written off as never happened.
I go back to my apple martinis and overpaid lobbyists.
how do you want to do this?
mile marker 47.
there's an old historical site near the road.
three hours.
and come alone. If I even see one pair of boots...
no tricks.
you can trust me, Tracy.
he's on his way.
show me.
some stuff melts. Some burns.
water boils. Kinda like a microwave.
that's very impressive.
you should see what happens around pacemakers.
you know, I heard you at the door.
that kid you hit at school, he didn't call your mother a whore; you lied.
you do that a lot.
why do you care?
because you live a half a block down from my father.
if that's a coincidence, God's improved his sense of humor.
you're wrong.
I'm no one.
I'm not. I don't have any friends.
shoplift crap I don't even want. Sell my ritalin to meth mouths at school.
no, no, don't worry.
he's lying. At least, about the drugs.
she hates me, you know.
no. I don't.
well, I don't even need an ability to know that that's a lie.
she can see it in you, Luke.
what you can do.
no, she doesn't know about it.
I'm not talking about the power.
I'm talking about you.
this is what scares them, what's in here.
the will.
I love my son.
I just want him to be happy.
well, he's not.
you lie, Luke, because you'd rather be anyone else other than yourself.
that's why you got into that fight.
that kid could be dead with your ability, and the only reason he's alive is cause of your kindness, and that scares you.
I want you to tell me about this power and everything you know about the man down the street.
wait.
stop. - Aah!
no, Luke, stop!
stop it! Luke, stop!
you killed him!
he was gonna-- - he was gonna save us!
Hey, take me with you.
what, did you hear me? And so what? - Yes.
so you just killed the one shot I had at finding my old man.
he was gonna shoot you in the head. I mean, I could just let him.
and I let you live.
which is kind of a big deal for me.
I could tell you more about your father.
Yeah, so could a milk carton. I'm not that interested.
look, I can't stay here.
with her. With this. I mean,
you're the only one who understands what it's like. I know where he is.
well, you're not lying. Which only means you think you can find him.
and I know why you're looking for him.
tell me.
because you're just like me.
trying to figure out why you are the way you are,
and in this whole hellish world, your dad might be the only answer.
you take me with you, I'll walk you right up his driveway.
does your mother have a car?
not anymore.
what do I do If something goes wrong?
I'll be right here.
get close to him, okay? Use your powers.
God, what if I kill him? - You're not going to.
just disable him.
we get him, we use him as leverage against the government.
look, he's not my brother anymore, Tracy,
and he's not your boyfriend.
you understand?
Yeah. - Go.
I came alone.
just like you asked.
Where's Peter?
I've got him.
I told him that you offered us amnesty.
he'll come out when he knows he's safe.
it's like I told you. You deliver me peter,
I give you your life back.
you'll be surrounded by your friends, you can play house with the governor, and nobody gets hurt.
you must know I'd assume this was a trap.
but I came anyway, Tracy, for you.
and the offer still stands. You deliver me Peter,
you get to go free.
you're serious?
Tracy, I am not the devil you think I am.
someone like you I can trust.
you and I, we think alike. Peter's...
he's unpredictable.
he's got it in his head he's gonna save the world, and that is not how it's gonna end.
he is gonna end up getting all of you killed.
all of you.
what are you saying to her, Nathan?
what, are you telling her that I'm unstable? Crazed?
you lock me up,
you fix everything, you call off your dogs.
I got Peter. You take the girl.
you said you were alone.
I know.
how many times are we gonna do this?
as many times as it takes.
do it. Take the shot.
I don't have it. - Back 'em off.
I can't do that. - Back them off.
it's over, Pete. Give up.
take the shot.
no, this is the beginning.
take the damn shot.
take her.
Nathan, don't do this!
get your hands off of me! No!
look at me!
don't do this!
what the hell was that? - I told you I didn't have it.
I saw it.
you had Peter cold.
Yes, I did.
thank you.
you know me.
you know I didn't want any of this.
containment, protecting them from themselves, that was always my goal.
now Peter's loose, Parkman, the others.
both sides have tasted blood. The next move is theirs.
thank you. I will send money for gas.
toss your cell phones.
this is the last time we get together using these things.
we find each other, so can they.
I figure we have 15 minutes.
understood. You need to see these.
Where'd you get these? - Matt.
he drew them right after the crash.
he has Isaac's gift.
I recognize this building. It's the Divya Velukkai in new Delhi.
India?
the warrior must have his sword. I must regain my powers.
help defeat this menace.
it is my destiny to go there.
it is?
then perhaps it's ours to seek justice.
I don't want it.
what they're doing to us isn't justice.
it's just stupid. It's blind fear.
well, if you don't want to see them punished, what do you want?
I want 'em to pay. For Daphne.
Matt, that's not us. That's not you.
let's get one thing straight.
our lives as we knew them are over.
we can't go back to anything that we knew.
then what do we do?
we bring the fight to them, - with everything we got. - it won't be easy.
credit cards, bank accounts, they're gone.
homes are gonna be watched. Can't trust the phones.
we gotta find a way to defend ourselves.
we leave everything.
we do what it takes to survive.
things we can't even imagine.
remember, they're gonna come for us.
and when that day comes, we have to be ready.
you've been awfully quiet since you got back.
just tired.
it was a hard trip.
I bet.
two days of scouting colleges, all those sorority mixers.
your dad said you begged him to stay another day.
so, any decisions?
I just, um...
I was thinking of maybe staying close to home for a while.
getting a part-time job.
Oh, my god.
I would love that.
I really missed you.
the house would be empty without you.
Claire's home she's safe. We both know Peter.
sooner or later, he's gonna come to you.
when he does...
can I count on you to do the right thing?
that's not why you called, Nathan. I can hear it in your voice.
you suddenly see how this could all end badly,
and you're looking for reassurance.
maybe even absolution.
but I'm not giving it.
you pushed me aside and went to the president
because you thought your team could handle this.
and I suggest you do exactly that.
they're ready for you, sir.
God.
get me out of this. - Can't do that.
Why? - It's too late.
why are you doing this?
what I have come to realize is that these powers just lead to chaos.
good people, through no fault of their own, cannot control it.
it just leads to disaster.
you son of a bitch.
maybe that's what you tell yourself so that you can sleep at night.
but this is about you.
your ambition.
it's all you are, Nathan.
it's all you ever were.
try not to fight it. It'll be easier.
you're one of us.
you're one of us, Nathan!
hold her down. - You're one of us, Nathan!
you're one of us, Nathan! You're one of us!
it is so nice To have everyone under the same roof again.
Noah, I hope this new job will keep you home for a while.
Absolutely.
what does a consultant do Exactly?
well, it's complicated.
mostly I meet with various business And government people...
and consult.
honey, do you have to do that at the table?
sorry.
so I have yet to hear Word one about your trip.
nothing much to tell.
you visited five Of the best colleges on the east coast
and you have nothing to tell?
which ones did you like, Noah?
brown.
I liked brown.
come back here.
I think all this ivy league talk Might be a little intimidating.
maybe community college would be a better fit for now.
I'll go talk to her.
what the hell was that?
I can't lie to her anymore. Your new job!
our father/daughter college tour.
we can't risk her knowing anything right now.
the last time she knew, she almost got herself killed.
your mom and Lyle are safer this way.
dad, you've been telling me that since i was 15.
they're not just watching you, Claire.
they're watching me.
you brought a plane down out of the sky, Federal agents are dead,
and a lot of people want to see you pay.
if either one of us strays from the script, I won't be able to stop them.
there won't be any paper trail. No trial.
one day, you'll just be gone And nobody can find you.
and now's the part where you tell me How everything you do, you do to protect me.
no.
now's the part when i tell you Exactly what you're going to do next:
start classes at costa verde community.
you're already enrolled.
history, english lit, Spanish.
and come monday morning,
you better be parked in that front row With a sharp number two pencil
or there is going to be hell to pay.
wires are up.
accounts are frozen.
we have traffic electronic eye serveillance From all 50 states.
patriot act gives us a lot of leeway here.
what's our status on the Bennet girl?
eyes only.
we look, but we don't touch.
senator Petrelli Has granted ms. Bennet a probation for now.
should the terms of that arrangement be compromised,
I will certainly bring it to his attention.
assuming he finishes his latte and decides to show up for work.
double espresso.
and Claire Bennet is still off-Limits.
now I know a lot of you lost friends On this crash.
you want payback. I understand that.
not all of these individuals Out there are dangerous.
some of them are just plain scared.
now that they know they're being pursued,
they're gonna be even that much harder to catch.
which is why i put in a request To the white house this morning to double our funding.
we need to show progress. These are our targets.
know them, hunt them, Track them, and bring them home alive.
this is so cool.
road trip. My mom never took me anywhere.
Ooh, we should stop at some skanky dinner somewhere
and get some pie And some milkshakes.
we're not stopping.
sure?
it's a long way till we get to your dad.
where is he?
I told you, "just keep heading west."
Yeah, you told me to keep heading west.
now I want to know exactly where he is.
okay, he told me That if he ever had to disappear, I could find him in minnesota.
he's got a cabin in the woods About 28 miles west of
you're lying.
it's amazing how you can do that. - Tell me where he is.
okay, okay.
he has an ex-Wife who's a flight attendant.
she lives in des moines. They had a kid that was born with some sort of...
bone dis
stop.
I can tell when people are lying
because I saw open their skulls And rip their abilities out From their brains.
so you're like a serial killer.
I'm not a serial killer.
but you've got a pattern.
you go after specific victims. You collect mementos.
okay, technically, i'm a serial killer.
now that we've established that,
give me one good reason
why i shouldn't tear open your head right here.
because you'll never find your dad.
it's not a road trip. Do you understand?
sir!
are you alex?
you're a girl.
Yeah, I am.
no, it's just we don't normally get a lot of girls in here.
you know?
listen, I'm just here to deliver a message.
you're in danger.
you need to get out of here immediately.
what? - Oh, come on.
a hot blonde in a comic book store? Please. Victor sent you, right?
this is payback for the whole birthday thing, right?
wait, let me guess.
is this all gonna end with you giving me Like a lap dance or something?
No!
you have to listen to me, all right?
this is not a joke.
there are people out there who are after you.
they will come in here and take you away.
Yeah! In here?
Oh, come on. You gotta do a better job convincing me.
your life Is in danger.
move. Now.
you wanna tell me what the hell is going on?
there's a man in here.
he's looking for you, And he's very, very dangerous.
do you have your car here?
Yeah, yeah, but it's out back. - Alex working today?
I'm from the county clerk's office.
afraid we have a situation With some outstanding parking violations.
um, would you rather just go talk outside?
sorry.
uh, this isn't a really good time. Is it important?
look, dad, I just
I was thinking about what happened this morning...
sweetheart, I'm gonna have to call you back.
go!
we're gonna need a team down here.
come on. Come on. Come on.
come on??
hello.
Hi. MY NAME IS ANDO.
I'm SORRY. I'M ANNAPURA. - ANNAPURA.
your NAME IS FAMILIAR.
are YOU A GUEST OF THE GROOM?
no, NOT EXACTLY.
are YOU OKAY?
just A LITTLE SAD. THAT'S ALL.
on YOUR WEDDING DAY?
but
this IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE HAPPIEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE, ISN'T IT?
Yes, THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.
then YOU MUST CALL OFF THE WEDDING.
this IS INCREDIBLE.
I've BEEN FEELING SO LOST AND CONFUSED.
I've ASKED THE HEAVENS FOR A SIGN TELLING ME WHETHER I SHOULD MARRY OR NOT.
a SIGN.
uh, YES, A SIGN.
um...
Ando? What are???
you ARE THE SIGN!
you're THE ONE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.
sign. NO, NO, NO, NO.
it's NOT HIM. IT'S ME.
I'm THE SIGN.
that's IT.
the WEDDING IS OFF.
do WE HAVE ANY RESPONSE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE?
nothing YET.
so THESE ARE THE BAD GUYS.
Abby COLLINS. HOMELAND SECURITY.
Nathan PETRELLI. NICE TO MEET YOU.
the WHITE HOUSE HAS TRANSFERRED OVERSIGHT OF YOUR OPERATIONS TO DHS.
I'm HERE TO KICK THE TIRES AND FIND OUT WHAT IT IS WE BOUGHT.
just WHAT WE NEED. ANOTHER BUREAUCRAT.
can I GIVE YOU A TOUR?
I DON'T KNOW HOW FULLY BRIEFED YOU ARE ON WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS.
I MADE IT CLEAR THAT EAGLE ROCK PRISON IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE FOR OUR NEEDS.
the REASON I'VE ASKED FOR SUCH A LARGE FUNDING INCREASE
is TO REINFORCE THE FACILITY SO I CAN DEAL WITH THESE PRISONERS.
right, BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL MAGIC.
you DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THIS, DO YOU?
who PUT YOU ON THIS ASSIGNMENT EXACTLY?
people CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS EXPOSURE ON THIS.
time TRAVELERS, MIND READERS.
we ARE DEALING WITH A THREAT THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
we NEED BETTER CONTAINMENT. I CAN BARELY HANDLE THE ONE DETAINEE I...
are YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU'RE KEEPING A PRISONER HERE?
without WARRANT OR MIRANDA RIGHTS?
I'm GONNA NEED TO SPEAK WITH THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY.
Yeah, WELL, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
I'm YOUR NEW BOSS, AND I WANT TO SEE YOUR PRISONER NOW.
this IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
place LIKE THIS, - WORSE FOOD, THE BETTER. - LUKE.
you REALLY GOT TO STOP TRYING TO BE MY FRIEND, OR I'M GONNA HAVE TO KILL YOU.
do YOU LIKE BIRDS?
what?
well, NOW, I'M JUST WONDERING IF IT'S GENETIC.
I MEAN, YOUR DAD, HE'S WAY INTO BIRDING.
I WENT WITH HIM SOMETIMES. HE'D COME GET ME UP ABOUT 4: 00 A. M.
and WE'D BE OUT WALKING A TRAIL BY DAWN.
we'd SEE GOLDFINCH AND CORMORANTS, WOODCOCKS.
he'd ALWAYS BE PULLING THIS OLD,
rusty WAGON BEHIND HIM, CARRYING ALL HIS BIRD BOOKS.
red WAGON?
Yeah, IT HAD THESE--IT HAD THESE BIG, BIG RUBBER WHEELS.
he USED TO PULL ME IN THAT WAGON.
I REMEMBER LAYING IN A RED WAGON...
all WRAPPED UP IN BLANKETS.
it WAS STILL DARK AND THE SILHOUETTES OF THE TREE BRANCHES...
I REMEMBER THINKING THEY LOOKED LIKE...
snake FINGERS.
he SOLD YOU FOR MONEY, YOU KNOW.
told ME ONCE HE HAD A LITTLE BOY A LONG TIME AGO, BUT
he NEEDED CASH, SO HE SOLD HIM.
what KIND OF MAN SELLS HIS OWN SON?
why WOULD HE EVEN TELL YOU SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
maybe I REMINDED HIM OF YOU.
Oh, MY GOD. - I KNOW. IT LOOKS HARSH.
we TRIED INSULATED GLOVES, BUT SHE SHATTERED RIGHT THROUGH THEM.
the CONSTANT HEAT IS TO ENSURE... - ABBY.
this IS TRACY STRAUSS.
you KNOW HER.
she USED TO LOBBY FOR A DEFENSE CONTRACTOR.
Abby, THEY WON'T LET ME OUT OF HERE. YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
what IS THIS INSANITY?
this WOMAN IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
Abby, HE'S LYING. YOU KNOW ME.
this WOMAN IS TRACY STRAUSS, AND YOU HAVE HER SHACKLED TO A CHAIR.
that's WHY WE NEED BETTER FUNDING.
funding?
I AM SHUTTING THIS OPERATION DOWN TODAY,
and THEN I'M GOING TO THE A. G.'s OFFICE
and I'M FILING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AGAINST YOU, SENATOR.
this IS TORTURE. YOU'RE THROUGH.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
they're JUST LOCKING PEOPLE UP?
believe IT. IT'S HAPPENING.
somebody SENT ME TO WARN YOU. YOU MUST BE ON A LIST OR SOMETHING.
a LIST? WHY IS HE AFTER ME?
do YOU HAVE A POWER?
like A SPECIAL ABILITY OR SOMETHING?
I CAN BREATHE UNDERWATER.
you MEAN LIKE-- - LIKE A FISH. YEAH.
I WAS ON THE SWIM TEAM IN HIGH SCHOOL.
one DAY, I NOTICED I JUST DIDN'T HAVE TO COME UP FOR AIR ANYMORE.
never TOLD ANYONE.
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE OTHERS.
you THINK I'D BE PROUD OF IT OR SOMETHING, BUT...
instead, I JUST...
feel LIKE A...
like A FREAK?
look, DON'T GO HOME.
don't USE YOUR CREDIT CARDS OR YOUR CELL PHONE.
if HE CAN FIND YOU AT WORK, HE CAN FIND YOU ANYWHERE.
what AM I GONNA DO?
I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.
what?
that CAR THAT DROVE PAST. SECOND TIME IT WENT BY.
is THIS CAR REGISTERED UNDER YOUR NAME?
get OUT.
car's STILL WARM.
believe ME NOW?
let's GO.
the HOUSE SPECIALTIES
so THIS IS YOUR PLACE?
with SHYLA. YES.
we OPEN TWO YEARS AGO.
against MY GRANDFATHER'S WISHES.
your GRANDFATHER?
he BELIEVES IN TRADITION.
thinks WOMEN SHOULD BE AT HOME RAISING THE CHILDREN.
that's WHY HE ARRANGED MY MARRIAGE TO DEEPAK.
but YOU DON'T LOVE DEEPAK.
he IS A POWERFUL AND DANGEROUS MAN.
above THE LAW.
my GRANDFATHER WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO DENY HIS REQUEST TO MARRY.
you MUST BE HUNGRY, MY HERO.
let ME BRING YOU MORE.
Deepak. THE GROOM.
go on, "Hero."
save the day.
excuse ME.
is EVERYTHING OKAY IN HERE?
who THE HELL IS THIS?
Ando. HE IS MY FRIEND.
I SEE.
so YOU CANCELED THE WEDDING BECAUSE OF HIM?
no, NO, SORRY, YOU'RE MISTAKEN. I AM JUST A GUEST. SIR!
calm DOWN, SIR. - NO!
put THE POT
Deepak HIT HIM WITH THIS.
Ando COLLAPSED.
and THEN?
Deepak CARRIED HIM OFF.
we FOUND HIS CAR. HE ABANDONED IT ABOUT A HALF A MILE AWAY.
Yeah, FOR A LOCAL KID, HE'S PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.
if YOU'RE TELLING ME IT DOESN'T SMELL RIGHT, I NOTICED.
did YOU KNOW YOUR DAUGHTER'S CAR IS PARKED A HALF BLOCK SOUTH OF YOUR LOCATION?
Yeah, I SAW THAT.
she MENTIONED SHE HAD SOME ERRANDS TO RUN.
it's A SMALL TOWN.
we'll TALK.
at LEAST TELL ME HOW LONG THIS IS GONNA LAST.
are WE DRIVING FOR ANOTHER HOUR? ANOTHER WEEK?
Hey, CHECK OUT SUPER POWER.
Oh!
Ah, GOD!
stop IT. - WHAT? I'M JUST MESSING WITH HIM.
not HERE.
we DON'T NEED THE ATTENTION.
our POWERS ARE NOT FOR AMUSEMENT, LUKE, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER REALLY TALKED TO ANYONE ABOUT IT BEFORE.
my MOM THINKS I'M ENOUGH OF A FREAK AS IS.
so WHAT, YOU ONLY USE YOUR POWERS FOR A REASON?
usually.
sometimes I DISAPPOINT MYSELF.
always HAVE AN OBJECTIVE.
know YOUR END GAME BEFORE YOU LIFT A HAND.
what ELSE?
keep A CLEAR HEAD.
emotions MAKE YOU SLOPPY.
the MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR MOTIVATION. ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT.
what IS IT THAT YOU WANT?
for ME, UM...
it's MOSTLY BEEN ABOUT ACQUIRING ABILITIES, BUT LATELY...
lately, ALL I WANT TO FIND IS MY FATHER.
I WANT TO MEET THE MAN WHO MADE ME.
look HIM IN THE EYES.
what ARE YOU HOPING TO SEE IN THERE?
where I CAME FROM, I GUESS.
why I TURNED OUT THE WAY I DID.
I'm JUST THINKING HE'LL HAVE SOME ANSWERS. THAT'S ALL.
this IS THE ADDRESS. IT'S A TWO-DAY DRIVE.
you SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
now THERE'S NOTHING TO KEEP ME FROM KILLING YOU, IS THERE?
well, I GUESS I'M JUST HOPING THAT YOU WON'T.
emergency EXIT-- WALK, DON'T RUN.
what? - MOVE.
there's ONLY TWO. WE CAN TAKE 'EM.
they're THE SCOUTS.
gotcha.
right ON THE SWEET SPOT.
everyone ON THE FLOOR, NOW!
please DON'T LET HIM HURT ME ANYMORE.
don't LET HIM HURT ME ANYMORE, PLEASE.
please, JUST DON'T LET HIM HURT ME ANYMORE.
I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY MOM. PLEASE, I JUST WANT TO GO BACK.
stand BACK.
that WAS FRICKIN' AWESOME!
Hey, SYLAR!
Sylar! - THANKS FOR THE ADDRESS.
what?
Sylar, WAIT! STOP!
Deepak WILL LET ANDO GO IF I HONOR MY COMMITMENT TO MARRY HIM.
and IF YOU DON'T?
I MUST PREPARE FOR THE WEDDING.
stop!
this WEDDING CANNOT GO ON.
ANNAPURA CANNOT GET MARRIED TO THIS MAN.
she's BEING FORCED INTO THIS AGAINST HER WILL.
you ARE MAKING A MISTAKE.
you HAVE KIDNAPPED MY FRIEND. I WANT HIM BACK.
he's BEING HELD HOSTAGE.
it IS NOT I WHO BROKE OUR AGREEMENT.
she DOES NOT WANT TO MARRY YOU.
Anna? Is this true?
all MY LIFE, I'VE TRIED TO PLEASE YOU, GRANDFATHER.
but IF I MARRY DEEPAK,
I WILL BE GIVING UP EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS MOST TO ME.
perhaps A TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS NOT MY DESTINY.
we HAD A DEAL.
the WOMAN AND THE BAKERY BELONG TO ME.
you LEAVE HER ALONE.
give ME BACK MY FRIEND.
that's IT. THE WEDDING IS OFF.
you're TOO MUCH TROUBLE. I DON'T WANT TO MARRY YOU.
and YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LOUSY FRIEND BACK.
this IS IT.
the MOMENT IN THE DRAWING.
this IS ME BEING THE HERO.
I did!
so HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
dad.
wanna TELL ME WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE DOING HERE?
I WAS JUST APPLYING FOR A JOB AT THE COFFEE HOUSE.
stop IT, CLAIRE. - WHAT? THEY POSTED A "HELP WANTED" ONLINE.
I KNOW YOU'RE LYING.
well,
I DID LEARN FROM THE MASTER.
you THINK YOU'RE INVINCIBLE, BUT YOU'RE NOT.
just BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE INJURED DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T BE CAUGHT.
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY THINK I CAN'T CONTROL YOU ANYMORE?
that's THE THING, DAD.
you CAN'T.
reports ARE IN FROM THE DINER. THEY BROUGHT DOWN THE KID, LUKE CAMPBELL.
Sylar?
DHS IS TRYING TO TAKE US DOWN,
and ALL WE HAVE IS A 17-YEAR-OLD BOY.
from THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY.
you ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED TO CEASE AND DESIST THIS OPERATION IN ITS ENTIRETY.
Abby, DON'T DO THIS.
give ME FIVE MINUTES.
let ME CHANGE YOUR MIND.
just SUSPEND YOUR DISBELIEF FOR A SECOND
and IMAGINE THAT THESE PEOPLE EXIST, PEOPLE WHO POSSESS POWERS.
it STILL WOULDN'T JUSTIFY TORTURE.
I'm TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CAN SLICE YOUR HEAD OPEN WITH THEIR FINGER...
make YOU THINK WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK,
get INSIDE YOUR HEAD.
this IS YOUR ARGUMENT.
that THESE PEOPLE ARE SO DANGEROUS THAT THEY HAVE NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS?
there's NO JUSTIFICATION FOR TREATING PEOPLE THIS WAY.
and AMERICAN CITIZENS, NO LESS.
you CAN'T PULL THE PLUG ON A WAR WHEN YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN TO THE FRONT LINES
fire!
I'm REALLY SORRY YOU HAD TO WITNESS THAT TODAY.
I KNOW HOW UPSETTING THAT MUST HAVE BEEN.
it's DEFINITELY SOMETHING I WON'T SOON FORGET.
I WOULDN'T BE DOING ANY OF THIS UNLESS I BELIEVED IN THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST TOO DANGEROUS TO BE AMONG US.
don't WORRY. YOU'LL HAVE ALL THE FUNDING YOU NEED.
don't FILL UP.
your DAD'S BRINGING HOME TAKEOUT FROM THAT NEW INDIAN PLACE.
sounds GOOD.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO PRY THIS MORNING. SOUNDS LIKE YOUR TRIP WAS A LITTLE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT. DISAPPOINTING?
did YOU GUYS HAVE ANY FUN AT ALL? TAKE IN A BROADWAY SHOW?
dad WAS A LITTLE BUSY...
abducting INNOCENT PEOPLE.
he's NOT BEEN HONEST WITH YOU, MOM.
he's NOT A CONSULTANT.
he's WORKING FOR A SECRET PROGRAM IMPRISONING PEOPLE WITH POWERS.
the COMPANY?
no.
no, THE COMPANY'S GONE. THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE.
honey, ARE YOU SURE? I MEAN, MAYBE
I WAS THERE. I SAW IT.
they WERE LOADING PRISONERS ONTO A TRANSPORT PLANE.
they HAD THEM ALL HOODED.
they WERE DRUGGED.
it WAS HORRIBLE.
Oh, MY GOD.
it's STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN.
no, THIS IS WORSE. THEY'RE TAKING EVERYONE.
not JUST DANGEROUS PEOPLE. ANYONE WITH AN ABILITY.
Matt PARKMAN. DR. SURESH.
I'm SORRY.
I JUST CAN'T LIE TO YOU ANYMORE.
indian FOOD?
go ON UPSTAIRS, HONEY.
what's GOING ON?
Noah, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I JUST CAN'T.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
hunting PEOPLE DOWN. - YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING.
don't LIE TO ME, NOAH.
you HAVE NO IDEA...
I REALLY WANTED TO BELIEVE...
how BIG THIS THING IS. - THAT YOU COULD CHANGE.
that YOU COULD BE SOMEONE DIFFERENT FROM WHO YOU REALLY ARE.
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS?
maybe I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE!
there IS ALWAYS A CHOICE!
the GOVERNMENT IS PUTTING TOGETHER A LIST OF PEOPLE THEY ARE ROUNDING UP,
and THEY HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT IF I AM NOT ON BOARD, THAT CLAIRE WILL BE ON THAT LIST.
don't MAKE THIS ABOUT CLAIRE!
Tracy, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT,
but YOU BETTER GET USED TO THE HEAT
because YOU ARE NEVER GETTING OUT OF HERE AGAIN.
we BOTH KNOW WHAT YOU DID.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
broken CHAIN, UNLOCKED DOOR.
you WANTED ME TO ESCAPE.
you KNOW WHAT?
next TIME, I WILL.
Hey! SOMETHING'S WRONG.
team LEADER, THIS IS CENTRAL, PLEASE RESPOND.
team LEADER, THIS IS CENTRAL. PLEASE RESPOND.
team LEADER, THIS IS CENTRAL. DO YOU COPY?
repeat, DO YOU COPY?
this IS CENTRAL COMMAND. GO TO CHANNEL B.
please RESPOND. DO YOU COPY?
team LEADER, THIS IS CENTRAL.
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHY YOUR NAMES ARE SO FAMILIAR.
a FAX CAME IN ADDRESSED TO HIRO AND ANDO.
see?
it's FROM SOMEONE NAMED REBEL.
who?
just AN ADDRESS IN LOS ANGELES.
and THE WORDS, "SAVE MATT PARKMAN" .
it's A MESSAGE FROM DESTINY.
so YOU STRAIGHTENED IT ALL OUT WITH MOM,AND NOW YOU'RE OFF TO A NEW ASSIGNMENT?
no.
no, YOUR MOTHER WANTS ME TO MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR A WHILE.
she's RIGHT.
we KEEP TOO MANY SECRETS IN THIS FAMILY.
so I'M GONNA TRY TO BE A BETTER PERSON.
better HUSBAND, BETTER FATHER.
and NOT TELL LIES.
and IF WE ALL WORK REALLY HARD TO BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER,
then MAYBE WE CAN...
heal THESE WOUNDS.
but I'LL BE AROUND.
we'll GET THROUGH THIS.
I LOVE YOU, CLAIRE BEAR.
I'll SEE YA.
thanks FOR COMING BACK FOR ME.
I DIDN'T COME BACK FOR YOU. I CAME BACK FOR THIS. YOU JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE.
Mm- HMM. - TRACKED ME TWICE IN LESS THAN A WEEK.
I KNEW IF I KEPT DRIVING, IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY CAUGHT UP TO ME AGAIN.
I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK.
still, YOU COULD HAVE JUST LEFT ME.
excuse ME?
the ANALYST WHO DIED IN THE HALL TODAY. THAT WAS HIS NAME.
thought YOU'D WANT TO KNOW.
he LEFT A WIFE AND TWO KIDS.
you LET HER OUT, DIDN'T YOU?
you MURDERED AN INNOCENT MAN.
there ARE TIMES IN WAR
when SOMEONE HAS TO FALL ON A GRENADE.
he DIDN'T FALL. YOU THREW HIM.
I SAVED YOUR ASS.
this ENTIRE PROJECT WAS ABOUT TO BE FLUSHED,
and I HELPED US BOTH OUT, PETRELLI. IT NEEDED TO BE DONE.
I'm SORRY THAT A MAN HAD TO DIE.
why DON'T YOU GO APOLOGIZE TO HIS BLOOD STAIN? IT'S STILL WARM.
staying HERE AT THE HOTEL?
just FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
I'm ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT IN TOWN IF YOU KNOW OF ANYTHING.
Mm-mm.
welcome TO COSTA VERDE.
well, IT LOOKS LIKE OUR FRIEND HERE HAD ABOUT THREE TOO MANY.
don't WORRY. WE'LL GET HIM HOME SAFE.
it is so nice to have everyone under the same roof again.
Noah, I hope this new job will keep you home for a while.
Absolutely.
what does a consultant do exactly?
well, it's complicated.
mostly I meet with various business and government people.
and consult.
honey, do you have to do that at the table?
sorry.
no. can't.
so I have yet to hear word one about your trip.
nothing much to tell.
you visited five of the best colleges on the east coast and you have nothing to tell?
which ones did you like, noah?
brown. I liked brown.
come back here.
I think all this ivy league talk might be a little intimidating.
maybe community college would be a better fit for now.
I'll go talk to her.
what the hell was that?
I can't lie to her anymore.
your new job!
our father daughter college tour.
we can't risk her knowing anything right now.
the last time she knew, she almost got herself killed.
your mom and lyle are safer this way.
dad, you've been telling me that since I was 15.
they're not just watching you, claire.
they're watching me.
you brought a plane down out of the sky, federal agents are dead, and a lot of people want to see you pay.
if either one of us strays from the script, I won't be able to stop them.
there won't be any paper trail. No trial.
one day, you'll just be gone and nobody can find you.
and now's the part where you tell me how everything you do, you do to protect me.
no.
now's the part when I tell you exactly what you're going to do next:
start classes at costa verde community.
you're already enrolled.
history, english lit, spanish.
and come monday morning, you better be parked in that front row with a sharp number two pencil or there is going to be hell to pay.
wires are up.
accounts are frozen.
we have traffic cam feeds from all 50 states.
patriot act gives us a lot of leeway here.
what's our status on thet ennegirl?
eyes only.
we look, but we don't touch.
senator petrelli has granted ms. Bennet a probation for now.
should the terms of that arrangement be compromised,
I will certainly bring it to his attention.
assuming he finishes his latte and decides to show up for work.
double espresso.
and claire bennet is still off-limits.
now I know a lot of you lost friends on this crash.
you want payback. I understand that.
not all of these individuals out there are dangerous.
some of them are just plain scared.
now that they know they're being pursued, they're gonna be even that much harder to catch.
which is why I put in a request to the white house this morning to double our funding.
we need to show progress.
these are our targets.
know them, hunt them, track them, and bring them home alive.
this is so cool.
road trip. My mom never took me anywhere.
Ooh, we should stop at some skanky diner somewhere and get some pie and some milkshakes.
we're not stopping.
sure?
it's a long way till we get to your dad.
where is he?
I told you,"just keep heading west.
Yeah, you told me to keep heading west.
now I want to know exactly where he is.
okay, uh, he told me that if he ever had to disappear, I could find him in minnesota.
he's got a cabin in the woods about 28 miles west of
you're lying.
it's amazing how you can do that.
tell me where he is.
okay, okay.
he has an ex-wife who's a flight attendant.
she lives in des moines. They had a kid that was born with some sort of. bone dis
stop.
I can tell when people are lying because I saw open their skulls and rip their abilities out from their brains.
so you're like a serial killer.
I'm not a serial killer.
but you've got a pattern.
you go after specific victims. You collect mementos.
okay, technically, I'm a serial killer.
now that we've established that, give me one good reason why I shouldn't tear open your head right here.
because you'll never find your dad.
it's not a road trip. Do you understand?
sir!
are you alex?
you're a girl.
Yeah, I am.
no, it's just we don't normally get a lot of girls in here. You know?
listen, I'm just here to deliver a message.
you're in danger.
you need to get out of here immediately.
what? -Oh, come on.
a hot blonde in a comic book store?
please. Victor sent you, right?
this is payback for the whole birthday thing, right?
wait, let me guess.
is this all gonna end with you giving me like a lap dance or something?
No!
you have to listen to me, all right?
this is not a joke.
there are people out there who are after you.
they will come in here and take you away.
Yeah!
in here?
Oh, come on. You gotta do a better job convincing me.
your life is in danger.
move. Now.
move. Now.
you wanna tell me what the hell is going on?
there's a man in here.
he's looking for you, and he's very, very dangerous.
do you have your car here?
Yeah, yeah, but it's out back.
Alex working today?
come on.
I'm from the county clerk's office.
afraid we have a situation with some outstanding parking violations.
um, would you rather just go talk outside?
sorry.
uh, this isn't a really good time. Is it important?
look, dad, I just-- I was thinking about what happened this morning.
uh, sweetheart, I'm gonna have to call you back.
go!
we're gonna need a team down here.
come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
hello. My name is ando.
I'm sorry.
I'm annapura.
ANNAPURA. Your name is familiar.
are you a guest of the groom?
no, not exactly.
are you okay?
just a little sad. That's all.
on your wedding day?
but this is supposed to be the happiest day of your life, isn't it?
Yes, that's what they say.
then you must call off the wedding.
this is incredible.
I've been feeling so lost and confused.
I've asked the heavens for a sign telling me whether I should marry or not.
a sign.
uh, yes, a sign.
.
you are the sign!
you're the one I've been waiting for.
sign. No, no, no, no.
it's not him. It's me.
I'm the sign.
that's it.
the wedding is off.
do we have any response from the white house?
nothing yet.
so these are the bad guys.
homeland security. -Nathan petrelli.
nice to meet you.
the white house has transferred oversight of your operations to dhs.
I'm here to kick the tires and find out what it is we bought.
just what we need.
another bureaucrat.
can I give you a tour?
I don't know how fully briefed you are on what's happened here for the last few days.
I made it clear that eagle rock prison is woefully inadequate for our needs.
the reason I've asked for such a large funding increase is to reinforce the facility so I can deal with these prisoners.
right, because they're all magic.
you don't believe any of this, do you?
who put you on this assignment exactly?
people close to the president are concerned about his exposure on this.
time travelers, mind readers.
we are dealing with a threat the likes of which this country has never seen before.
we need erbett containment.
I can barely handle the one detainee I.
are you telling me that you're keeping a prisoner here?
without warrant or miranda rights?
I'm gonna need to speak with the president directly.
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen.
I'm your new boss, and I want to see your prisoner now.
this is what I'm talking about.
place like this, worse food, the better.
you really got to stop trying to be my friend, or I'm gonna have to kill you.
do you like birds?
what?
well, now, I'm just wondering if it's genetic.
I mean, your dad, he's way into birding.
I went with him sometimes.
he'd come get me up about 4: 00 A. M.
and we'd be out walking a trail by dawn.
we'd see goldfinch and cormorants, woodcocks.
he'd always be pulling this old, rusty wagon behind him, carrying all his bird books.
red wagon?
Yeah, it had these--it had these big, big rubber wheels.
he used to pull me in that wagon.
I remember laying in a red wagon.
all wrapped up in blankets.
it was still dark and the silhouettes of the tree branches.
I remember thinking they looked like.
snake fingers.
he sold you for money, you know.
told me once he had a little boy a long time ago, but he needed cash, so he sold him.
what kind of man sells his own son?
why would he even tell you something like that?
maybe I reminded him of you.
Oh, my god.
I know. It looks harsh.
we tried insulated gloves, but she shattered right through them.
the constant heat is to ensure.
Abby. This is tracy strauss.
you know her.
she used to lobby for a defense contractor.
Abby, they won't let me out of here.
you have to do something.
what is this insanity?
this woman is extremely dangerous.
Abby, he's lying. You know me.
this woman is tracy strauss, and you have her shackled to a chair.
that's why we need better funding.
funding?
I am shutting this operation down today, and then I'm going to the A. G.'S office and I'm filing human rights violations against you, senator.
this is torture.
you're through.
I can't believe it.
they're just locking people up?
believe it. It's happening.
somebody sent me to warn you.
you must be on a list or something.
a list? Why is he after me?
do you have a power?
like a special ability or something?
I can breathe underwater.
you mean like - like a fish.
Yeah.
I was on the swim team in high school.
one day, I noticed I just didn't have to come up for air anymore.
never told anyone.
I didn't know there were others.
you think I'd be proud of it or something, but.
instead, I just.
feel like A.
like a freak?
look, don't go home.
don't use your credit cards or your cell phone.
if he can find you at work, he can find you anywhere.
what am I gonna do?
I don't know. We'll figure something out.
what?
that car that drove past. Second time it went by.
is this car registered under your name?
get out.
car's still warm.
believe me now?
let's go.
the house specialties
so this is your place?
with shyla. Yes.
we open two years ago.
against my grandfather's wishes.
your grandfather?
he believes in tradition.
thinks women should be at home raising the children.
that's why he arranged my marriage to deepak.
but you don't love deepak.
he is a powerful and dangerous man.
above the law.
my grandfather was too frightened to deny his request to marry.
you must be hungry, my hero.
let me bring you more.
what's the matter with you?
we came all this way.
and you stole my chance to get my powers back!
I only stopped the wedding, like the drawing said.
the drawing wanted me to stop the wedding!
Hiro, I have a power now.
I saw a way to help that gitl, so I did!
well you did it wrong!
no, I did it my way.
and that's what really bothers you.
than I have powers, and you don't!
you can't stand the fact that now you're my sidekick!
the groom.
go on hero
save the day.
excuse me.
is everything okay in here?
who the hell is this?
Ando.
he is my friend.
I see.
so you canceled the wedding because of him?
no, no, sorry, you're mistaken.
I am just a guest. Sir!
calm down, sir. - No!
put the pot
Ando!
Deepak hit him with this.
Ando collapsed.
and then?
Deepak carried him off.
Ando.
we found his car.
he abandoned it about a half a mile away.
Yeah, for a local kid, he's pretty good at this.
if you're telling me it doesn't smell right, I noticed.
did you know your daughter's car is parked a half block south of your location?
Yeah, I saw that.
she mentioned she had some errands to run.
it's a small town.
we'll talk.
at least tell me how long this is gonna last.
are we driving for another hour?
another week?
Hey, check out zz topp.
Ah, god!
stop it. - What?
I'm just messing with him. - Not here.
we don't need the attention.
our powers are not for amusement, luke, you understand that?
I mean, I don't know. I've never really talked to anyone about it before.
my mom thinks I'm enough of a freak as is.
so what, you only use your powers for a reason?
usually.
sometimes I disappoint myself.
always have an objective.
know your end game before you lift a hand.
what else?
keep a clear head.
emotions make you sloppy.
the most important thing is that you understand your motivation.
always know what it is that you want.
what is it that you want?
for me, um.
it's mostly been about acquiring abilities, but lately.
lately, all I want to find is my father.
I want to meet the man who made me.
look him in the eyes.
what are you hoping to see in there?
where I came from, I guess.
why I turned out the way I did.
I'm just thinking he'll have some answers. That's all.
this is the address. It's a two-day drive.
you shouldn't have done that.
now there's nothing to keep me from killing you, is there?
well, I guess I'm just hoping that you won'T.
emergency exit-- walk, don't run.
what? - Move.
there's only two. We can take 'em.
they're the scouts.
gotcha.
right on the sweet spot.
everyone on the floor, now!
please don't let him hurt me anymore.
don't let him hurt me anymore, please.
please, just don't let him hurt me anymore.
I want to go back to my mom.
please, I just want to go back.
stand back.
that was frickin' awesome!
Hey, sylar! Sylar!
thanks for the address.
what?
Sylar, wait!
stop! Sylar!
Deepak will let ando go if I honor my commitment to marry him.
and if you don't?
I must prepare for the wedding.
stop!
this wedding cannot go on.
Annapura cannot get married to this man.
she's being forced into this against her will.
you are making a mistake.
you have kidnapped my friend.
I want him back.
he's being held hostage.
it is not I who broke our agreement.
she does not want to marry you.
Anna? Is this true?
all my life, I've tried to please you, grandfather.
but if I marry deepak, I will be giving up everything that matters most to me.
perhaps a traditional marriage is not my destiny.
we had a deal.
the woman and the bakery belong to me.
you leave her alone.
give me back my friend.
that's it.
the wedding is off.
you're too much trouble. I don't want to marry you.
and you can have your lousy friend back.
this is it.
the moment in the drawing.
this is me being the hero.
so how was your day?
dad.
wanna tell me what the hell you're doing here?
I was just applying for a job at the coffee house.
stop it, claire.
what? They posted a "help wanted" online.
I know you're lying.
well, I did learn from the master.
you think you're invincible, but you're not.
just because you can't be injured doesn't mean you can't be caught.
do you have any idea what happens if they think I can't control you anymore?
that's the thing, dad.
you can'T.
reports are in from the diner. They brought down the kid, luke campbell.
Sylar?
DHS is trying to take us down, and all we have is a 17-year-old boy.
from the office of the secretary.
you are hereby notified to cease and desist opethisration in its entirety.
Abby, don't do this.
give me five minutes.
let me change your mind.
just suspend your disbelief for a second and imagine that these people exist people who possess powers.
it still wouldn't justify torture.
I'm talking about people who can slice your head open with their finger.
make you think what they want you to think, get inside your head.
this is your argument.
that these people are so dangerous that they have no constitutional rights?
there's no justification for treating people this way.
and american citizens, no less.
you can't pull the plug on a war when you haven't even been to the front lines.
scuse me.
fire!
I'm really sorry you had to witness that today.
I know how upsetting that must have been.
it's definitely something I won't soon forget.
I wouldn't be doing any of this unless I believed in the bottom of my heart these people are just too dangerous to be among us.
don't worry. You'll have all the funding you need.
don't fill up.
your dad's bringing home takeout from that new indian place.
sounds good.
I didn't mean to pry this morning.
sounds like your trip was a little--I don't know what.
DISAPPOINTING?
did you guys have any fun at all? Take in a broadway show?
dad was a little busy.
abducting innocent people.
he's not been honest with you, mom.
he's not a consultant.
he's working for a secret program imprisoning people with powers.
the company?
no.
no, the company's gone. This is something else.
honey, are you sure? I mean, maybe
I was there. I saw it.
they were loading prisoners onto a transport plane.
they had them all hooded.
they were drugged.
it was horrible.
Oh, my god.
it's starting all over again.
no, this is worse. They're taking everyone.
not just dangerous people.
anyone with an ability.
Matt parkman. Dr. Suresh. Peter.
I'm sorry.
I just can't lie to you anymore.
indian food?
go on upstairs, honey.
what's going on?
Noah, I can't take it anymore. I just can'T.
what are you talking about? - I know what you're doing.
hunting people down. - You don't know what I've been doing.
don't lie to me, noah.
you have no idea. - I really wanted to believe.
how big this thing is. - That you could change.
that you could be someone different from who you really are.
do you have any idea how difficult this is? Maybe I don't have a choice!
there is always a choice!
the government is putting together a list of people they are rounding up, and they have made it very clear to me that if I am not on board, that claire will be on that list.
don't make this about claire!
Tracy, I don't know how you did it, but you better get used to the heat because you are never getting out of here again.
we both know what you did.
what are you talking about?
broken chain, unlocked door.
you wanted me to escape.
you know what?
next time, I will.
something's wrong.
team leader, this is central, please respond.
team leader, this is central. Please respond.
team leader, this is central. Do you copy?
repeat, do you copy?
this is central command. Go to channel B.
please respond. Do you copy?
team leader, this is central. Please respond.
I finally figured out why your names are so familiar.
a fax came in addressed to hiro and ando.
see?
it's from someone named rebel.
who?
just an address in los angeles.
and the words,"save matt parkman.
it's a message from destiny.
so you straightened it all out with mom, and now you're off to a new assignment?
no.
no, your mother wants me to move out of the house for a while.
she's right.
we keep too many secrets in this family.
so I'm gonna try to be a better person.
better husband, better father.
and not tell lies.
and if we all work really hard to be honest with each other, then maybe we can. heal these wounds.
but I'll be around.
we'll get through this.
I love you, claire bear.
I'll see ya.
thanks for coming back for me.
I didn't come back for you.
I came back for this. You just happened to be there.
tracked me twice in less than a week.
I knew if I kept driving, it was only a matter of time before they caught up to me again.
I needed to understand how they work.
still, you could have just left me.
excuse me?
the analyst who died in the hall today. That was his name.
thought you'd want to know.
he left a wife and two kids.
you let her out, didn't you?
you murdered an innocent man.
there are times in war when someone has to fall on a grenade.
he didn't fall. You threw him.
I saved your ass.
this entire project was about to be flushed, and I helped us both out, petrelli.
it needed to be done.
I'm sorry that a man had to die.
why don't you go apologize to his blood stain? It's still warm.
staying here at the hotel?
just for a little while.
I'm actually looking for an apartment in town if you know of anything.
welcome to costa verde.
well, it looks like our friend here had about three too many.
don't worry.
we'll get him home safe.
to BE CONTINUED...
I don't like this, Matt.
Oh, you got any better ideas?
it's a huge risk being out in the open. We should be laying low.
and what? What?
run forever?
I don't know.
Yeah, that's my point.
we're being hunted, and we have no idea by who.
how, why?
Noah Bennet has all the answers we're looking for.
Hey, did you get it?
Amobarbital. One dose of this, he's knocked out cold.
what? What's wrong?
can't you just read his mind? Get what we need that way?
no, we've been over this.
Noah is too well trained, and he's never off his guard.
guys, look, I was a cop.
you're a scientist, a nurse.
we did nothing wrong, and they turned us into fugitives.
Yeah, but drugging and kidnapping people?
I don't like it either, but this way gives us answers.
Yeah, straight-up interrogation isn't gonna work.
not with Bennet.
we'll need to get creative.
staying at the hotel?
just for a little while.
I'm actually looking for an apartment in town.
you know anything?
uh, no.
welcome to costa verde.
looks like our friend here had about three too many.
don't worry, we'll get him home safe.
well?
it's working.
it's working.
ten people died last night in ohio when a house spontaneously caught on fire.
I'm thinking we should investigate sooner rather than later.
it's over, Noah. It's all over.
primatech may have burned to the ground, but that doesn't change anything.
we have a lot of work to do.
primatech should have been shut down a long time ago.
the company had a good run, but its time has passed.
no, we got the job done.
Yes, you certainly did.
and I appreciate it.
what is this?
for your years of service.
pension, severance.
and this is from me.
why are you doing this?
bag and tag. One of us, one of them.
it's an antiquated system desperately trying to remain relevant.
so we adapt and we get it right.
I don't think we can. I don't think we should.
I am tired, Noah.
I have told so many lies.
maybe it's not too late to cobble my family back together.
it's a good thing.
you get to go home to Claire.
this is everything you've ever fought for, and you've won.
this is all I've ever known.
what am I supposed to do now?
take care of Claire.
take care of yourself.
all right, so I'm gonna be able to get to these memories that we're looking for.
I'm gonna find out exactly how this whole thing happened, who's behind it, how they work.
we're gonna find out how to stop hiding and start fighting back.
and how far are you willing to push?
as far as I need to.
this better be good.
face time at state dinners is hard to come by.
you heard from Bennet?
no, why?
he's off the grid going on three hours.
standard orders are to check in after duty. He didn't.
how 'bout Claire, she okay?
Yes, your daughter's fine.
I want every inch of surveillance on Noah Bennet.
everywhere he's been, everywhere he might go.
you're spying on your own men?
nobody's above scrutiny, myself included.
you and Bennet are both compromised.
what's that supposed to mean?
your brother Peter, your daughter Claire.
Peter gets treated like everyone else.
Yeah, and Claire gets a free pass.
that makes both yours and Bennet's choices tarnished.
are you spying on me?
you barely touched your prime rib.
everything okay out there?
still feels like we're sitting ducks in here, come on.
you can't rush an interrogation.
this isn't an interrogation, it's torture.
you're straining his entire system.
what, do you think I'm hurting him on purpose?
I think you have a personal vendetta, yeah.
I don't think you know what the hell you're talking about.
they killed daphne, Matt. -Daphne...
this isn't about daphne.
this is about me helping everybody.
well, you're not helping him.
he has done much worse to me.
you're better than him, Matt.
that's my point. -No, the point is, he's in pain.
does he have to be?
look, the drugs are-- it's not gonna be comfortable.
I'm digging through his brain-- -To find a memory.
can we really trust this?
I mean, who knows what information's been tainted by time and perception?
we know nothing--he knows everything that we need to know.
he's right.
do I have your permission to go back in now?
let's find out how this whole thing began.
need any help?
um, four letter word...
thin man dog.
Asta.
I'm gonna go get changed.
if you're gonna shower, you should go.
we have dinner in an hour with the pierots.
who?
Jenny and ken?
we're on the pta with them at lyle's school--they're nice.
Oh, right.
you didn't make any other plans, did you?
no, no. Sounds great.
it's nice to have you around.
Claire's, uh...
I have no idea, actually.
at the mall, maybe.
she's at the library.
secret service thing. -Ah, of course.
I didn't want her to see me here.
I wanted to talk to you alone.
you have a-- a minute?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
come on in.
what's going on?
I've set some things in motion.
things...
everything's gonna change, and I just want you to know Claire's gonna be safe.
what do you mean "safe"?
what have you done?
you know, I got into politics so I could... help people, make the big impact.
what have you done?
I'm certain that you involved yourself with the company for the same reason.
you sensed there was a need.
well, that need still exists.
people with abilities are a threat.
primatech is closed.
with all due respect, primatech never did the job that was required of them.
then you have the solution.
the united states government has the resources and the authority to contain this problem.
wait a minute, what are you talking about here, rounding people up?
for starters, yeah.
Incarceration's the only way to make sure everybody's safe.
everybody.
yourself included.
certain exceptions need to be made.
is Claire an exception?
she could be.
but I need your help.
what do you plan to do once you have everybody?
we find an answer.
get the best team of scientists, and we find a way to eliminate these abilities forever.
and if that's not possible?
I refuse to accept that.
my abilities were given to me. They can be taken away.
you know you're gonna be seen as a villain.
locking people away.
I'll play whatever role I need to.
Claire will never look at you the same way again.
Claire never needs to know.
but she will. They all will.
and they will blame you.
they won't understand.
I have gone so far off the rails with this, so far around the bend...
I nearly killed my own brother.
and I just want a chance to make things right.
what do you want from me?
you spent 20 years tracking these people.
I want to know how you did it.
what is all this stuff?
this is the last 20 years of my life.
and you kept it.
it's hard to throw this stuff away.
Noah, I am the U. S.Government.
we have loads of... weapons and...stuff.
I realize you don't need weapons.
but you need perspective.
and you need to control information.
in 30 seconds, you undid a secret that we've kept for over 30 years.
I can't un-ring that bell.
I know you can'T.
look, I joined the company for a reason.
and that reason doesn't disappear just because your mother decides to turn off the lights.
I thought you'd enjoy the extra time with your family.
there's only so many crossword puzzles I can do.
he planned it all...
with nathan.
they did it together.
did you hear what I just said? Your brother is to blame for all of it.
Yeah, I know.
so? -So?
so what?
I tried to stop him. It didn't happen.
okay, but what are we gonna do, nothing?
well, we can't do anything from memories, can we?
I've never done this before. It's not an exact science.
it's not science at all, Matt!
if you want to go, just go!
that's not what I'm saying.
but it's what you're thinking, huh?
you think you deserve this, to be hunted, after all that you've done.
you're reading my mind?
I don't have to read your mind!
you're an open book.
look, you wanna get caught? Fine, turn yourself in.
but we're not lugging your baggage.
I could say that same thing about you!
I told you this is not about daphne!
stop! Both you!
we're supposed to be on the same side.
you don't think what I'm getting here is real, huh?
fine.
storage unit combination lock.
in here--it is filled with things we need.
guns, money. Go.
go!
I'll go.
try not to kill one another.
jackpot.
sir, I think I have something.
where?
gotcha.
where is he?
Costa verde, breaking into Bennet's storage facility.
is it a live feed?
we've got a local team on the move to apprehend him.
how does he know about Bennet's storage facility?
they working together?
I'm reserving judgment.
I want him caught.
he's in a room stocked full of guns.
am I clear?
you're risking your own men's lives.
I want Peter caught.
no bloodshed.
you gentlemen hear that?
tasers on stun.
Yes, sir.
we lost visual. Go, now!
Peter should have been back by now.
Yeah, just, uh...
just give him some more time.
I'll tell you why Peter isn't here.
he's been captured or killed.
shut him up.
I never checked in.
they'll be looking for me by now.
come on, do it! -Mohinder knows I'm right.
my storage unit is under surveillance.
you sent Peter right where they wanted him.
you'd say anything to get the hell out of here.
doesn't mean I'm lying.
you know me well enough to know that's true.
Matt, we should go. -He's right.
your only hope is to let me go, and escape while you can, Matt.
wait a second. We're not finished.
you said--you said you-- you check in...
with who?
who else are you working with?
show me.
I am not letting you in my head.
you can't stop me.
who is it? Come on, who is it?
welcome to building 26.
I see the government spares no penny.
not on equipment, not on personnel.
we are building an elite team.
well, I'm glad to be part of it.
now, there are a few ground rules that I would like to implement.
primatech had a system.
one of us, one of them.
working alongside people with abilities.
it helps to even the odds.
Yes, I read your file.
I think we'd be better served with one of us and one of us.
I'm sorry?
or 10 of us...
12 of us...
and none of them.
a lot of the people you're targeting are good people.
they're useful people.
well, this isn't about ethics. It's about trust.
about us...and them.
by your own admission, your way didn't exactly work.
prisoners escaping, loyalty issues--it was a mess.
a mess.
for 20 years, I was successful at making sure that people like you never knew people like them even existed.
you don't presume to know anything about me.
I thought I was running this operation.
well, the situation's become a little bit more complex, Noah.
it's important that we look at everything from as many angles as we can.
okay?
glad to see you got your old job back.
how else would I randomly bump into old acquaintances?
something big is happening.
I need your help.
why would I believe anything you say?
because it's true.
I realize we haven't always played nice with each other, but...
you have a unique perspective.
you've been ordinary and extraordinary, so you understand our fear.
what exactly is happening?
a government program.
and it is going to blow up in their face.
I need you, mohinder.
I need your brain. I need your strength.
together, we can help people.
we can save lives.
what do you say?
he came to you.
what?
I just saw you and him in a cab.
you knew about this.
you didn't tell him?
all right Matt, let me explain.
why didn't you tell him?
I wasn't talking to anybody.
I thought it was the safest thing.
that's why you didn't want me in his head.
you didn't care about his health.
you were afraid of what I'd find.
no.
Yes, he approached me.
but I said no.
you should have told me about this.
why didn't you tell-- Uhh!
what could I have done?
tied up on an airplane too!
you think I don't regret any of this?
you're my friend.
you could have warned me!
you could have warned all of us!
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't believe him.
even after the plane, the leash-- -What, told you that I could've stopped all of this?
that I could have maybe prevented daphne's death?
if I had, I'd probably be the one tied up in that chair.
all right, check back there. I got over here.
Hi.
we gotta hurry. They found me. They're gonna find us.
we're gonna get all the answers we're looking for without the drugs.
I want him to feel everything.
how do we fight back?
you always have a plan, now you're gonna share it with us.
listen to Peter and get the hell out of here while you still can.
how much time do you think you have, Matt, before they find us?
maybe we should just take what Peter has and run.
you don't get a vote!
what are you talking about? -Nothing.
Mohinder knew that we were gonna get attacked by the government.
is that true?
Bennet came to me, yes.
but I didn't believe him.
he manipulated me before, and I didn't think I could trust him.
why didn't you say something?
as if any of you would believe me after what I've done.
Yeah, it's better that we didn'T.
you're a coward!
can you get anything more out of him?
I was just about to do that.
who's the guy you were taking orders from, huh?
wait, wait, what guy? I thought he was in charge.
turns out he's still middle management.
who is he?
who?
you.
you got a minute?
I think we got off on the wrong foot.
I was hoping we could talk.
what are we gonna talk about?
we're gonna be working together.
I thought maybe it'd be a good idea if we, uh...
what?
got to know each other better?
understood where the other guy was coming from.
I already know where you're coming from.
and where is that?
you got a family at home.
a wife, a boy.
and your daughter Claire, right?
she's the special one with the soft spot in the center of her soft heart.
that's right.
you're a dime a dozen.
and 11 of the 12 are unreliable.
you don't know anything about me.
that's the whole point of this.
all that time you worked at your company, you danced the fine line between company man and family man.
I'm not much for dancing.
you're oversimplifying it.
I think you're overcomplicating it.
hunting them or harboring them...
to win this war for good, it takes focus.
and yours is just a little split right now.
I've read your files too, mr. Danko.
I've known men like you.
is that right? -Sure.
simple, unconnected. Take your work home with you.
you're never off the job.
you think that makes you perfect.
not perfect, just better than you.
these aren't terrorists you're hunting.
they're people.
this job is about understanding their humanity, not their ability.
but you have to be human to do that.
you're a valuable asset.
but once we begin engagement, I have to know...
are you gonna take orders, or continue undermining me with every glance?
you're the boss.
Matt, don't do this.
don't push this any further.
Peter, I got another address for you.
no... -What did you see?
no, you go after this guy and you're dead.
you're all dead. You can't undo it.
this guy's in charge.
don't listen to him.
this is why we came.
we want to cripple them. We want to hurt them.
this is the guy.
no, Peter, you're making a big mistake.
you're unraveling things you don't understand.
secure all the exits.
wait for my order before moving in.
I want eyes on the scene.
you really should lock your windows.
sir, we have a situation.
tell me you found Bennet.
no, sir, not Bennet.
did you already mobilize the unit?
I was waiting for your order, senator.
so you're the one that's driving all this.
making us run, hide.
Peter, right?
you're the good brother.
compassionate one.
you want me dead?
do it.
you wanna die?
no. But you came here with a mission, right? So...
get it over with.
you think you're innocent?
that you're the good guy?
you broke into my house, put a gun to my head.
you are the one who's hunting us.
with good reason.
and it's not ever gonna stop.
and what is that?
they'll see what I've been telling them.
they'll know just how dangerous you people are.
he's right, you know.
Hello, nathan.
don't do it, pete.
how the hell'd you get here so fast?
I know you might think I'm the bad guy here, pete, and maybe I am.
but you've gotta believe me when I tell you-- -I don'T.
I'm done believing in you.
this isn't you.
all right...
if you kill him.
the order will come down to kill you all, and I won't be able to contain-- Just shut up!
Shut...up!
let 'em figure a way out of this.
I was right.
you can't trust either of them. Not really.
they're moving in on Matt and mohinder right now.
you pull the trigger, you're signing their death warrant.
why did you tell him about parkman and suresh?
I just saved your life.
you're welcome!
move in.
take 'em now!
they don't know which room we're in. We should make a break for it.
you're never gonna stop hunting us.
even when you had the chance to stop, you didn'T.
daphne's alive, Matt. They have her, alive.
you're lying to me. -No, no, no, no.
see for yourself. I won't fight you.
I go back inside your head right now and we get caught.
go in.
find out.
I'll hold them off.
it's what you've wanted.
all right, go.
this one's alive.
gunshot wound to the shoulder.
get a sedative.
it's gonna take three times the normal amount to keep this one down.
daphne's alive, Matt.
come on.
I said come on, all of you!
Matt, listen to me. You're not a killer.
this is only gonna get worse for you.
you're gonna have to escalate beyond anything you could ever imagine!
you should have just taken the damn watch and stayed home.
drop it.
don't hurt him.
is there anyone else here?
no, just me.
let me walk him out.
just...
let me walk him out.
take a hard look at yourself before you judge me.
it wasn't too long ago you had me tied up.
don't use me to rationalize your actions.
what I did, what you're doing is wrong!
the curtain is up.
the government is involved in this now.
what you did-- what Peter, what Matt did
it got in the way of what I'm trying to accomplish.
and what's that, exactly?
the plane you were on.
that was taking you to a facility that was meant to contain you.
well, your actions supported the hard-liners, who believe you should all be executed.
me...
I still believe containment can work.
you're gonna round us up and imprison us forever?
that's your plan?
that's the first part.
then we're gonna find a way to control these powers.
to eliminate them, so we can go back to living what's left of our lives.
but I need your help.
that's not gonna happen.
you believe science has all the answers, right?
why don't you start with her?
she is alive.
for now.
but I'm losing that battle.
and unless you help me, I can assure you that my associates are gonna kill her.
and then they're gonna kill you.
and then they're gonna kill my brother...
and Matt.
you'll all be dead.
protocol after a man's taken prisoner is to grant him shore leave.
maybe you ought to take a few days off.
Matt my wife kicked me out of the house.
my daughter is scared to death of me.
what am I gonna do with time off?
you were right before.
when you said I was weak because of my split focus.
that's not gonna be a problem anymore.
the job is all that's left.
you have my complete dedication.
you still think I'm compromised?
they found your storage unit.
which, unless I'm mistaken, led you right to them.
you're the one that let 'em get away.
Yeah, I admit...
I underestimated them.
they got away because senator petrelli let his personal interests cloud his judgment.
kid gloves are standard issue in this outfit.
you aad I have to change that.
you agree?
Absolutely.
so?
all things considered, it went pretty well.
I think he trusts me.
don't be foolish, Noah.
that man trusts no one.
he will continue to test you.
I'm prepared to be tested.
because he's got it all wrong.
and so does nathan, for that matter.
there's no halfway anymore.
you're gonna have to play the role.
make tough choices to prove your loyalty to them, to their cause.
you know me.
I've always been comfortable with morally gray.
no...no, no.
this can't happen. All I wanted to do was find daphne.
this is why I didn't want to paint the future.
you're not capable of this, okay?
you are not a murderer.
how the hell do you explain this?
shades of Gary, Nennet house, Costa Verde, California - You.
Hey, Barbie.
I got a message from someone named Rebel?
said you could help me.
I need your help, Barbie.
rebel promised.
well, he lied.
now get out.
please.
I can't go back out there.
Claire? You okay?
Oh, my god.
mom. It's all right.
Mr. Doyle here was just leaving.
no, please.
they'll catch me.
rebel said you could help me start over,
and that's all I want
to go back to being a puppeteer,
making people happy.
and you thought I would help you?
after what you did?
you should know there are agents Parked outside this house.
actually, they're not.
rebel set a fake call,
which they'll figure out any minute now.
but if there were agents outside...
why aren't they kicking in the door,
looking to collect a comes-Back-To-Life Barbie?
they gave me a free pass,
but they will come after me If I try to help anyone.
so you turn your back on your own kind,
while we're all out there being hunted down?
they burned down my theater while I was still inside.
and you tried to kill us, you--!
you and your free pass.
you have no idea what it's like
to be hunted,
to live on the street,
to break into the home of the last person on earth
you'd expect to help you.
because she was your only hope.
I thought...
well...
I'm not gonna force you to help me, Claire.
that's not who I am anymore.
where the hell have you been?
dealing with the mess your brother left us.
there wouldn't have been a mess If you'd released parkman and millbrook
like I asked you to.
I made the right choice. Peter just got lucky.
though I have wondered
how many people knew he was on that rooftop.
Petrelli.
what?
Yeah, I'm on my way.
I thought parkman was in your custody.
he was last time I checked.
well, what the hell is he doing In front of the capitol building
with a bomb strapped to his chest?
no, no, no.
no, no.
deactivate the device now,
then lie face down.
I don't know if I try and pull this it's going...
I didn't do this. I was set up!
senator Nathan Petrelli.
sir, this is a very dangerous situation. I can't
lieutenant, I know that man.
I can get through to him.
you got five minutes.
Parkman!
you son of a bitch.
don't you come any closer to me.
it's gonna be all right. - No, it's not!
you turned me into a terrorist.
I didn't sanction this. That was Danko.
you're lying to me! - He's got an agenda.
you're lying to me! - Believe me, Matt.
use your power. Read my mind.
I'm telling you the truth.
I can't. I can't. They drugged me.
gonna have to trust me, Matt.
Parkman's vest is ready, sir, but we have a problem here.
Petrelli. How'd he get there so fast?
is the device armed?
we're all set.
senator wants to play hero...
he can be a martyr to his own cause.
take them out.
code confirmed, sir. - Do it.
take him out. Now.
I don't know where this came from!
I'm gonna blow up!
we've been kicked out.
get it back. Now.
...Though there are those who believe
that he may know the bomber personally.
what's going on here?
come on. We're losin' our window.
I'm routing through a different server.
Matt, if we don't disarm you, they're gonna shoot you.
there are a lot of bomb techs around here.
I'm sure one of them
is thinking about how to disarm that.
get inside his head.
the drugs are starting to wear off, but I don't think
what's he thinking?
running out of time.
red wire.
red wire. Red wire. - Red wire.
doesn't make any sense.
why would a suicide bomber bother with dummy wire?
don't touch the red wire. - I'm not touching anything.
we have to take the shot!
just hang on.
it's all right, Matt, take your time.
black wire is the key.
black wire. Black wire. - Black wire. Okay.
do I pull the black wire,
or is that the one I don't pull?
he's not thinking directly about it.
I gotta dig deeper. Hold on!
I got it. We're back up.
weapon armed, sir.
senator! - Matt, I'm gonna pull it.
all right, do it. - Danko.
I said do it.
wait!
damn it!
sorry, Matt.
I can't have you usin' your power.
it's open. [Coughs]
almost got the order ready.
you have a lot of pickups today?
I'm not here for a pickup.
no?
it's me.
Gabriel.
your son.
is that so?
that is so.
what brings you all the way out here?
I had some questions about myself...
who I am,
where I came from.
but then I remembered.
you abandoned me.
you killed my mother.
so?
what now?
now?
I kill you.
go right ahead.
you kill me, or the cancer does.
either way, I die.
I haven't got all day.
anything?
this guy's good.
there's no sign the system was even breached.
I wanna know how the hell he's getting inside, And I want a name.
me too.
so we can thank them
for saving us from this disaster.
of course,
since the safety of your friends and family
evidently trumps national security.
Parkman wasn't a threat。
until you strapped a bomb to him.
Parkman and your brother exposed our operations,
so I handled it,
put a face to the terrorist threat.
people could have died.
people have died, senator, or don't my men count?
I was brought in to get this job done.
I'd let go of that if I were you.
you're relieved of command.
I answer to the president.
you try to get rid of me, he's gonna want proof,
and right now it's my word against yours.
good luck getting any of my people to turn on me.
we'll see. Excuse me.
Bennet, you have a minute?
I'm not sure how much I can tell ya About what happened - I know what happened last night.
I wanna talk to you about putting a team together
once Danko's gone.
you're gonna head up our... - You're one of us, Nathan.
you're one of us!
you're one of us, Nathan.
you're one of us! - Do you have a point?
that maybe this operation
has been compromised from the start.
the Petrelli family has a lot of skeletons
in their closet, senator.
I think we both know what yours is.
So...looks like we're both building a case
against each other.
let's see who gets there first.
you're one of us, Nathan.
you're one of us!
help is coming, have hope - Son of a bitch went over my head.
you backed a wild dog into a corner. What do you expect?
I had to act. - But you didn't act.
all you did was show Danko your hand,
and, frankly, you put both of us at risk.
I had a plan, though.
Nathan, listen to me.
he's pushing your buttons
so that you'll make a mistake.
take a play from your mother's book.
keep your head.
sorry about all this.
I find that hard to believe.
the man who transferred you back here
is gonna come in in a few moments
and ask you some questions.
I was wondering when that was gonna happen.
I know this might seem hard to believe,
but I still care about you. - Well, that makes one of us.
come on. You're smarter than that.
you might not realize it,
but I have been helping you out all along.
you and everyone else.
and doing a fabulous job of it.
you remember when you jumped off the bridge and I was there?
I'm still the same guy.
you sacrificed me for your own personal gain.
you don't have to like me,
but you do have to understand that I am your last hope.
that's my prisoner.
got a soft spot for this one, Petrelli?
wanna make sure I don't get too rough with her?
no, no. Knock yourself out.
I wanna know everything you know about Nathan Petrelli.
he was lousy in bed.
I wanna know what you meant
when you said he was "one of us.
does Nathan have an ability?
an ability?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
you wanna talk about it?
should I have helped Doyle?
that puppet man is a sick and twisted individual, Claire.
you did the right thing.
I have a free pass for a reason.
I should be using it to help people.
rebel seems to think so.
Yes, well, this Rebel, whoever he is,
can't send psychopaths to our front doorstep.
I don't think I can take any more surprise guests.
right, which is why I was thinking
that I should have a cover job.
I mean, with Alex gone,
they're probably gonna need someone to fill his job
at the comic book store,
and I could help whoever Rebel sends,
and no more surprise guests for you and Lyle.
boy, Claire, I don't know.
I guess so.
if it's what you want to do.
Thanks.
so, you don't have any retail experience?
um, does a cheerleading bake sale count?
uh, you're a cheerleader?
Yeah, I was.
all right, so let me as you a few questions.
can you work wednesdays?
Wednesdays?
Wednesdays are when all the new comics arrive.
wednesday is good for me.
flight or invisibility?
I'm sorry. What?
do you throw caution to the wind
and fly off to save the day,
or do you take the more calculated approach
and learn the whole picture before you act?
what's the answer?
there isn't one.
that's why it's the question.
put simply, What type of hero are you?
I don't know.
whoa, hey, hey.
you're not gonna cry are you?
it--it's okay, really.
they're only comic books, I mean...
I'm gonna stop bothering you.
uh, thank you for letting me interview, anyway.
what are you talking about? You got the job.
I did?
every guy in the store's been staring at you
since you walked in.
you will absolutely sell comic books,
and the other stuff we can work on.
you're still here.
this is pitiful.
what's that?
what you've become.
you used to be a killer. Now look at you. You're pathetic.
Oh. You want a fight.
is that what you were expecting?
son kills his father? Epic battle?
Ah, that's a myth.
no, life
life never gives you what you want.
give me a hand with this.
maybe I can explain it to ya.
now, when I open the trap,
he's gonna bolt,
so grab him from the back, all right?
you have an ability.
got lots of 'em.
don't know what I got left.
been years since I used 'em
or needed them.
you have the same thing
taking people's abilities.
am I right?
guess the apple didn't fall too far from the tree.
I'm not your apple. You don't know anything about me.
I have some idea.
you and I, we can't be all that different.
from where I stand, We have exactly nothing in common.
Yeah, well, we pick easy targets.
like that rabbit--Weak, helpless.
not fair, really.
are you really drawing a moral line?
morality doesn't figure into it.
fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly.
you have to kill. It's who you are.
but you do choose your prey,
and yours never had a chance, not against you.
not really.
easy picking's.
small game.
they had something I wanted.
it isn't my fault
if they weren't strong enough to fight back.
and those agents
that have been comin' after us recently?
I handled them. - No, you ran away from 'em.
just like I did.
I could wipe them out with a thought.
but you haven't.
Why?
you know, there'll come a day,
maybe tomorrow or next week, next year,
when you realize the hunt...
...your entire life,
was meaningless and disappointing, 'Cause there's no challenge in it.
you know, all the power in the world doesn't matter
if you've lived an unsatisfied life.
and I think you know that already, don't you?
you wanna know more, or...
you gonna kill me now?
what do I do?
gut him.
while you were at primatech
did you come across anyone who could fly?
plenty,
but you know that.
it's in the files.
I'm guessing a few were missing.
the facility burned to the ground.
who knows what was lost?
that must have been tough for you.
20 years on the job.
I'm sure you've been close to the Petrelli family.
the Petrellis were never exactly
a warm and fuzzy bunch.
you adopted the senator's daughter.
I didn't know she was his at the time,
and neither did he, for that matter.
we both know Nathan Petrelli is hiding something.
you know what question you should be asking yourself?
who would want to save peter?
his mother? Angela?
you wanna know what's missing from the files?
who can fly?
she'd never betray her own son.
a long time ago, I gave up trying to figure out
what Angela Petrelli would or wouldn't do.
go ahead.
we've got a problem.
Nathan's made a power play against Danko.
he's stirred up a hornet's nest.
it's nice to know a mother still has some influence
over her son.
things will be better for us with danko gone.
of course they will, but Nathan's on thin ice.
he's moving too fast, and danko's unpredictable.
the man nearly killed peter.
it had to be done.
be prepared then, 'Cause I pointed him in your direction.
be careful. He does his homework.
so do I.
homework.
thank you.
see you tomorrow.
Bye.
Claire.
you all right? Everything okay at home?
Yeah. That's not what this is about.
I have a question,
and I really need you to answer it.
okay.
how did you lead two lives for all that time?
I can't always be myself,
and I just don't know who I'm supposed to be.
honestly, Claire,
I'm the worst person to ask.
so how am I supposed to decide which path to take?
which answer do you want?
do you want the one that's gonna make you feel better,
or do you want the truth?
I don't know.
well, then my answer is " neither do I."
Thanks.
I miss ya, Claire bear.
Doyle! Freeze!
put your hands over your head.
whatever you say.
when are you gonna learn?
I have this effect on women.
Doyle, I'm giving you a chance to surrender.
I should kill you...
but I just wanna go back to the way life was.
all right, Doyle.
Barbie?
Mrs. Petrelli.
my name is-- Mr. Danko.
I was hoping you could help me.
well, everything I know about the people you're after
is in the primatech files.
I'm not interested in files.
elle Bishop, Hiro Nakamura, Matt Parkman,
all inherited abilities from their parents,
as did Peter and Claire.
well, genetics
is an extremely complex topic, Mr. Danko.
did you know that two blue-Eyed parents
can sometimes have a brown-Eyed child?
so Nathan...
was the misfit?
sometimes these things skip a generation.
I don't believe you.
I've met many men like you, Mr. Danko.
our company employed dozens of them
no family, nothing to hold you back.
you operate in the shadows,
doing all the awful things other people just refuse to do.
it's what makes you useful.
and expendable.
Really?
that incident in Angola?
1997, I believe.
all those civilians lost. Tragic.
I'm surprised you survived, actually.
you're a very... resourceful woman,
Mrs. Petrelli.
a man needs a hobby,
somethin' to occupy the hands,
to stop the mind from thinkin' so much.
I fix watches.
watches?
thought it would make my father happy.
how'd that work out for ya?
you're still clinging to that need for connection, huh?
the only thing people are good for is disappointment.
is that why you killed my mother?
why you abandoned me?
I don't even remember.
didn't matter to me.
so few things do.
well, now what?
cut the thread.
go on.
how'd you do that?
it's just an ability I picked up
from a cheerleader in california.
I guess not everybody gets old.
not everybody dies.
then you just have
that much longer to suffer, don't ya?
get that. It needs to settle.
over there on that cabinet, if you don't mind.
sure.
what the hell are you doing?
it's amazing how it comes right back,
that desire, that hunger.
you think this is gonna stop me?
you think you can beat me?
I want that power!
I thought you'd given up.
Yeah, well, me too.
then why bother? What's the point?
immortality. You're my second chance.
at what? Killing again?
you said it was meaningless.
it was.
then why make the same mistake twice?
because I'll get it right this time,
do more, be more,
take every challenge,
fight hard, risk it all,
take real power, real authority,
change everything--The world,
just to see if I can.
you can move.
I can.
you're the hunter.
I thought you would know
when someone was playing possum,
when the prey isn't so weak,
so easy.
please...I need that power.
I don't wanna die.
>> No, no, no, of course not.
of course you don't.
it won't kill you if I take it.
you'll heal. You'll be fine.
Yeah, but so will you.
no. Don't...leave.
like I said, I came here to kill you.
I got the answers I wanted.
now I know exactly what I need to do.
kill me.
Oh, you're gonna die.
Slowly...painfully...
and alone with your sickness.
please...
don't.
I'm sorry.
you're just small game.
turns out the president
didn't really need that much proof after all.
it's a signed document. You're finished.
you lose me, you lose the whole team.
well, that's a risk I'm prepared to take.
in fact, anyone who's not on board
can step out now.
you're hitting reset on the whole operation
just because of me?
well, I think it's time things were done correctly.
you may have friends now, Petrelli,
but one day you're gonna find yourself all alone.
you went to the president?
Mm-hmm, and he is eager to meet Danko's replacement.
you comin'?
they say you're the man with the plan.
I sure hope you have something good
to share with the president.
it's a bit unorthodox, but it's tested.
look, it's over.
just let it go.
when are you gonna understand?
bureaucracy, oversight, rules of conduct,
none of it applies in my world.
I don't know what your world is,
but it ought to be shut down.
Danko, take it easy.
I've seen what these people can do,
and it scares me.
and the thing about you, senator,
is that through all this,
you've never once shown an ounce of fear,
and I wonder...
why is that?
I don't have time for this.
tell me you didn't know about this.
this is it-- Your new identity,
everything you need to start over.
rebel's erased any trace of Eric Doyle.
you saw me spare that agent's life.
is that it?
have I earned your help?
this isn't about you.
this is about me,
about who I need to be right now,
and I don't...
just take it.
Thanks, Barbie.
did you mean all that stuff you said
about how you'd changed?
finally.
I quit, and it takes the service
two hours to find a replacement?
well, don't just stand there.
come in. I'm desperate.
excuse me, please.
we are looking for Matt Parkman.
anyway, he's a mess.
here you go.
diaper's clean, but that won't hold.
take it.
take it.
no, thank you.
now.
W--Hey, wait.
we are here to save Matt Parkman.
Uh-huh. You're holding him.
Matt Parkman?
lots of luck. You're gonna need it.
and by the way,
this baby sitting service bites.
generations unfold
father to son, mother to daughter.
where one leaves off, the other follows,
destined to repeat each other's mistakes,
each other's triumphs.
for how do we see the world
if not through their lens?
the same fears, the same desires?
do we see them as an example to follow,
or as a warning of what to avoid?
choosing to live as they have
simply because it's what we know,
or driven to create one's own identity?
and what happens when we find them
to be a disappointment?
can we replace them?
our mothers, our fathers?
or will destiny find a way to drive us back?
back to the familiar comforts of home?

[continues in spanish]
>> yo soy su padre!
>> actually, he's my, uh, biological padre.
so...what's the plan? >> plan is to keep you safe.
I was exposed...
so that free pass i had for you went away.
but even danko's reach doesn't extend south of the border.
yet.
>> and what about everyone else?
>> i'll make some calls. put some things in motion.
all right, well...
we also gotta eat.
there's a cantina down the way. can i buy you a taco?
>> [chuckles] with, uh, what money?
>> i'll think of something.
>> think i'm just gonna go for a walk.
>> now, look, it's probably best that we stick together.
okay?
it's for your own safety.
>> i'll be careful. i promise.
>> all right, look, i'll meet you at the cantina, okay?
don't be-- [door thuds closed]
chapter eight into asylum >> think we're clear.
>> my very own guardian angel.
you're a good son, peter.
>> that's not why i saved you. i want answers.
>> and you think i've got them?
>> you always know more than you let on.
>> i'm sorry to disappoint you, but i need to find some answers for myself right now.
that's why i had you bring me here.
this is where i'm supposed to be.
>> so, tell me exactly what happened.
we were moving in to apprehend this guy.
agents whitman, price, and holiday went in, i watched the hallway.
and i heard three gunshots.
I ran in as fast as i could and i found them.
like this.
>> and you didn't see anyone?
>> no, sir.
nothing. i...
I'm sorry, sir.
>> go back to h. q. get cleaned up.
>> what are you thinking? >> no sign of a scuffle.
one bullet each in the back.
who was their intended target?
>> james martin. 32. high school geometry teacher.
amateur fly fisher.
>> bio doesn't exactly read "trained assassin.
what's martin's ability?
>> unknown. his dna was in the national database.
set off a red flag.
>> we're doin' that now.
>> you gonna lecture me about civil liberties?
>> no. about sending your men in blind.
unknown means martin could be anything.
he could be a telepath, a teleporter, an invisible man.
each one requires a different tactic.
>> our orders are to take them all in.
>> you're so desperate to chalk up a win, you're cutting corners-- is that it?
>> let's not forget you're nathan petrelli's boy.
and the last crusade was to catch this rebel, and you didn't catch him, did you?
you need a win a hell of a lot more than i do.
>> i love this song.
well, quite a bloodbath in there, isn't it?
did you get my gifts?
>> taxidermied bunny and the near-dead puppeteer... you shouldn't have.
>> it was an overture toward collaboration, since we both want the same thing.
>> and what's that again?
>> killing people like me.
I think we should pool our resources.
>> what's in it for you?
>> let's just say you fascinate me.
and you're in way over your head in there.
I can help you... if you want.
I can find the guy who killed your agents.
>> i want eyes on every road, every terminal, air, bus, roadblocks.
this isn't a drill, people. three of our own died.
and they will not die in vain. not on my watch.
not on yours.
so remember your training.
remember agents whitman, price, and holiday and their families.
remember, we don't sleep...
until this son of a bitch is caught.
any questions?
>> nice speech. >> we need a win.
you have 20 years' experience with these people, and i need a plan.
and i don't wanna hear, "one of us, one of them.
>> then i won't say it. but it got the job done.
the very same tactics that you used on all those counter-insurgency programs you ran from havana to kabul.
>> i don't know what you're talking about.
>> no. right. okay.
well, if you did know what i was talking about, then you'd probably understand the value of co-opting the native population.
working the enemy.
a little focused manipulation goes a long way.
>> how could you work with these people?
trust them?
>> who said anything about trust?
they're assets-- weapons to be mobilized.
motivate them.
greed, revenge, love, hate
whatever it takes to make the collar.
speaking of which...
I have reason to believe that sylar is here...in d. c.
this could be the win that we both need.
>> or it could be another chapter in the big book of you letting him slip through your fingers.
no. i, uh...
got another assignment for you.
>> voila.
>> where'd you get that? >> i sold my kidney.
actually, both of them. twice.
I found a pawn shop down the street.
sold the necklace my dad gave me.
my other dad.
>> you didn't have to do that.
>> i didn't want to, but he's mr. survival skills, and if he knew we were in a pinch and didn't sell it, he'd be mad. >> i expect he would.
it's a nice gesture, but i got everything under control.
this isn't exactly a simple situation here.
>> it seems simple to me.
government agents are out there hunting innocent people, and they're gonna keep going until you tell them to stop what you started.
>> would it kill you to show me just a little bit of gratitude?
>> for what? >> for what?
>> for--for giving you a free pass.
for risking my neck to save your life when it was over.
pick one--either one.
just common courtesy, claire.
>> why did you give me a free pass?
>> i had my reasons.
>> be back.
>> what are you gonna do with it?
>> turn it into more.
gentlemen. is that tequila?
>> the mass is ended.
may you go forth in peace and love and serve the lord.
>> you think sanctuary's gonna stop the agents from coming?
>> i can't sleep, peter.
to find where we should go, what we should do, i need to dream, and to dream i need to sleep, and i can't.
I haven't. not for a long time.
>> take a pill. >> doesn't work.
for the dreams to come, ones that matter, sleep has to be natural, has to be earned.
>> earned.
>> i always found peace here.
your father and i were married in this church.
we walked down this aisle.
your first communion...
even nana's funeral.
you're probably too young to remember, but you held my hand.
there used to be love in this family once.
look at us now.
it's all my fault.
>> you come here to be forgiven?
>> i'm not sure even god has that in him.
you boys wanna make this a little more interesting?
>> what'd you have in mind?
>> listen. come on, let's go.
>> $100 a hit. last man standing takes all.
listen, i can do this.
I used to do this scraping for shore leave money in the philippines, all right?
I'm good at it.
>> fine. >> all right.
>> go for it.
>> all right, boys.
line 'em up.
>> jenkins. >> sir. i wanted to check in.
see if there was anything else i could do.
>> no. just try to get some rest.
>> i wanted to tell you that what you said earlier about the guys...
it was inspirational.
I wish i had your strength.
>> hello.
>> special delivery.
>> how the hell did you get in here?
>> well, you'd be amazed what you can do with a lifted i. d. badge, a $4 tie, and a west baltimore accent.
[Chuckles] but you've got much bigger problems.
done some homework about that killer of yours.
>> i don't need your help.
>> well, i just found some evidence to the contrary.
there's another body.
he stashed it, you missed it. i found it, of course.
>> you're lying.
>> look in the box.
>> what's in the box? >> your answer.
how james martin was able to shoot your men in the back so easily.
it's because of what he can do.
he's a shape-shifter.
come on.
>> where is he?
>> just around the northeast corner.
>> 'scuse me.
>> hey--hey, i didn't do anything.
>> take him in. >> [groaning]
>> your coat's sopping wet. found this one in the bins.
it looked like something you'd wear.
>> well, it should. it's mine.
I made a donation last week.
it's supposed to go to someone who needs it.
>> you need it. come on.
didn't know you were still so active.
>> oh. i give them things.
not devotion, not myself. not the same.
it's like with you and your brother.
your father and i supported you, but we didn't give you support.
>> sure, you did. >> oh, peter.
there were times when you were growing up, you were so confused.
you were so desperate for answers, and i could have told you the truth.
I could have given you comfort.
I didn't.
you must hate me.
>> i'm gonna find you a cup of tea.
it'll help you sleep.
I don't hate you.
look, whatever's happened, you're still my mother.
>> i'm afraid that unconditional love isn't really love at all.
>> hey, why don't we just call it a draw?
you guys don't look so good.
>> nonsense.
>> you don't have to do this, you know.
>> yeah, i do.
we need the money, don't we?
besides, your dad's not the only one who can...
your other dad...
he's not the only one who can do stuff, you know.
Ah...
you better get your old man off to bed.
>> you need a rematch, huh?
how 'bout a rematch? >> uh-uh, no, man.
I beat him fair and square.
>> come on, what about... winning a little bit more?
hmm? >> what do you have in mind?
>> what about this watch? it's a pretty nice watch, huh?
>> it's a really nice watch, but...
I'm like...22 shots deep.
you're a little bit late for the party.
then i'd better catch up, huh?
>> you're not the only one who can get the drop on someone.
>> oh, you've been waiting here for me.
>> your m. o.'s predictable enough.
you desperately wanna find martin so you can get that ability, don't you?
>> i have plenty of powers. >> [chuckles]
but this is different.
shape-shifting. you're salivating.
I read your profile. [thunder crashing]
how you like to take on accents, affectations.
play characters. >> it's fun.
>> it's sad...you're so desperate to be someone else.
you want out.
>> you have no idea what i want.
>> shape-shifting. it's your escape hatch.
course, i could save you the trouble...
end it all for you, right now.
>> the part of my brain that you'd need to hit to kill me...
is microscopic.
>> i'm a pretty good shot. >> it's not that simple.
>> i also gotta jam something in there, right?
to make it stick.
>> well...[chuckles]
you've clearly thought all of this through, haven't you, except for the part where you can't catch your guy without my help.
>> you're all the win i need. the white whale.
>> maybe...i'm the goose who lays the golden egg.
I can round them all up.
>> you suggesting that i can't?
>> you chased a shape-shifter.
you don't chase... a shape-shifter.
just one... photo on that board...
just one...
and i could help you find them all.
then you can take your shot.
>> i asked to be extraordinary.
and i promised to make the world a better place.
so when i got my chance, i lived up to my end of the bargain.
for what?
I'm running for my life.
a lot of people are running for their lives.
they're hurt and they're dying, and i can't...help them.
do you even care what you put people through?
I mean, when i kneel here before you and i ask for help, do you even listen?
and i'm tired of fighting.
and i'm angry.
I'm angry at my father, nathan...
and my mother.
at you.
we had a deal.
I think it's about time you lived up to your end.
please, just...
show up.
>> i want the perimeter locked down.
>> excuse me...
what do you people think you're doing?
>> sit down, sir.
>> sir, we have reason to believe the church is harboring two fugitives.
chain the doors.
no one gets in or out, you understand?
>> yes, sir.
>> this is a waste of time.
Martin's halfway across the country by now.
>> no, he's not. he hasn't left the city.
he had his chance, and he didn't take it.
he showed up as agent jenkins right under your nose.
>> yeah, why would he do that? >> martin's only human.
we all crave routine. we just need to find his.
>> you got some special power for that?
>> i do. but i don't need it.
you can tell everything about a person from their belongings.
I thought you'd be better at this.
>> why's that?
>> 'cause you're a shape-shifter too.
I've been to your apartment-- you've got no books, no art, no keepsakes, no correspondence.
nothing to define you.
>> this is the part where you get under my skin.
I've seen your file too.
>> must be very hollow and boring.
not like martin's closet.
I've never seen so many costumes.
>> not much call for a geometry teacher to wear an armani suit.
>> or scrubs...or this.
it's fractured.
disjointed.
he's trying on personalities like clothes.
>> has he made a choice? >> not yet.
like all of us, he's still looking.
>> what's the common denominator here?
lawyer, doctor, priest?
>> power.
these roles give martin something he could never find in real life.
>> why? >> why does anybody want power?
to screw with people...
or to simply screw people.
tell me what you notice about all those pictures.
>> martin isn't in any of them.
or these are all...martin.
>> hmm. different men of power with different women of allure.
it's a cliche for a reason, and it's marvin's routine.
>> where is he?
>> where he goes every night...
lookin' to fall in love.
garden of eden what do you weigh, like a buck ten?
>> that's none of your business.
>> well, i'm just sayin', man.
you just don't even look drunk.
[slurring] i think that you're just jealous that i caught up.
>> yeah. after i put your old man to sleep.
>> oh, please. that's not hard.
he tends to bite off more than he can chew.
>> he's pretty slick, but he seems like a good guy.
>> he wants to be.
free passes and... swooping in and...
taking me off to mexico, thinking that's all he has to
>> i get it. my parents are divorced too.
>> no. it's not like that.
mayb i just wish he would take off his armor, shining or otherwise, ju a le humng thank you!
we need to go.
Hey, come on. we gotta go.
I won the money.
>> right there, that door. >> all right, i'll get it.
>> you got it?
>> i'm checking every one.
>> i'm sorry, peter. >> mom, you need to be quiet.
>> no. this may be our last chance together, and there are things i have to say
>> you don't have to say anything--it's okay.
>> listen to me! i was just like you.
my head in the clouds, full of hope.
I was gonna be a teacher.
and then my power manifested, and the dreams came.
visions of a bloody future of deceit and death
the apocalypse.
and when i woke... i tried to warn everyone, but no one would listen.
why would they? why should they?
I was cassandra screaming that the sky was falling, but when they looked up, there was no cloud in sight.
and i did it with lies...
and with manipulation...
and betrayal.
and it cost me everything
my friends, my husband, my boys.
>> mom. >> but peter...
it's the price i chose to pay to save the world.
[clunk] >> shh!
>> all clear.
>> you heard him. back up.
>> guess who's here?
>> where? which one?
>> i suppose that fits the pattern
a position of power, authority, significance.
I think you'll recognize him.
>> remember what happened last time you chased him.
>> what's he up to?
why me?
>> he's after power.
he thinks that's something you have.
he's trying to convert the power into love.
he's doing a pretty good job of it too.
he's a better you than you.
>> where'd he go?
>> okay. you should...
never, ever...
fly in that condition....
>> how are you not...
>> ah, the whole tissue regeneration thing
I think it includes my liver tissue.
>> oh, yeah?
I didn't know that.
I'm so sorry, claire.
>> let me...help.
>> i really messed up. >> it's all right.
it's fine.
>> it's not fine.
you know what i did when i found out about you?
I did what i always do.
I denied there was a problem, just like i'm doing right now.
>> you know, we should probably...
have this conversation in the morning.
>> the truth is, claire, i get a pit in my stomach every time i think of you.
it was just so stupid the way i handled it.
you know, i thought if i... kept my distance...
when the time was right, we would...
catch up.
but look at you.
I missed my chance. you're all grown up.
>> hardly.
>> you wanna know why i gave you a free pass?
because i thought in one move, i could win you over.
look, right now i'm using you as an excuse to hide behind this mess that i'm
you know what?
I know everybody's counting on me to fix it.
and i wanna try. i'm gonna do it for everybody.
peter...my mom...
for you.
I'm gonna fix it all.
I'll make it all...
>> i lost him.
>> me too.
>> i guess he's gone.
for good this time.
let's go.
>> you killed him.
>> no.
he's still alive.
wait.
can you do it without leaving...
>> good morning.
>> morning.
>> you really bailed me out with those kids last night.
I appreciate it.
>> that's what family's for, right?
so what's the plan?
are we going straight to washington?
>> no. look, i-i didn't make any calls to anybody.
I don't really have any friends on the hill at the moment.
>> but last night, you said that you would fix everything.
>> i was drunk.
I'm sorry if i got your hopes up.
>> there's gotta be something that you can do.
>> i'm wide open if you got any ideas.
Claire, i overreached.
I screwed up...and now it's just way beyond my control.
some things are bigger... than one man.
>> you know what?
over the years...
I couldn't help but...
think about my real dad...
who you were, what you looked like, your job... and then i met you.
and you were more amazing than anything i could have ever imagined.
>> it's just a fantasy. >> no!
no, it doesn't have to be!
you can do anything you want.
you can fly!
>> claire.
>> you're supposed to be superman.
>> feeling better?
>> i slept...
and i had a dream.
>> what about?
>> that.
or should i say "her"?
I know what we have to do now.
first...we need to go find nathan and claire, and we need to bring this family together.
and then we need to go visit my sister.
>> sister?
>> so where they headed anyway?
>> there's a quarter past ocho to san diego.
what time is it?
>> i got nothin'.
>> what happened to your watch?
>> i'm heading back up, you know.
>> good.
>> comin'?
>> in this dirty old part of the city where the sun refused to shine people tell me there ain't no use in tryin'
my little girl, you're so young and pretty and one thing i know is true you're gonna die before your time is due i know see my daddy in bed a-dyin'
see his hair been turnin' gray >> you okay, sir?
he's been workin' and slavin' his life away i know 'cause he's been workin', yeah every day slaving his life away he be working baby he's been working, work, work, work we gotta get out of this place if it's the last thing we ever do we gotta get out of this place >> those things'll kill ya.
>> so how did that feel...
zipping up that body bag?
cathartic.
poetic.
and tactically fortunate.
I'll be a lot easier for us to operate...
if everybody thinks i'm dead.
>> if we do this...
we succeed...
you'd be the only one left.
>> funny how that works.
>> we gotta get out of this place if it's the last thing we ever do girl, there's a better life for me and you

there's a cantina down the way. can i buy you a taco?
>> [chuckles] with, uh, what money?
>> i'll think of something.
>> think i'm just gonna go for a walk.
>> now, look, it's probably best that we stick together.
okay?
it's for your own safety.
>> i'll be careful. i promise.
>> all right, look, i'll meet you at the cantina, okay?
don't be-- [door thuds closed]
chapter eight into asylum >> think we're clear.
>> my very own guardian angel.
you're a good son, peter.
>> that's not why i saved you. i want answers.
>> and you think i've got them?
>> you always know more than you let on.
>> i'm sorry to disappoint you, but i need to find some answers for myself right now.
that's why i had you bring me here.
this is where i'm supposed to be.
>> so, tell me exactly what happened.
we were moving in to apprehend this guy.
agents whitman, price, and holiday went in, i watched the hallway.
and i heard three gunshots.
I ran in as fast as i could and i found them.
like this.
>> and you didn't see anyone?
>> no, sir.
nothing. i...
I'm sorry, sir.
>> go back to h. q. get cleaned up.
>> what are you thinking? >> no sign of a scuffle.
one bullet each in the back.
who was their intended target?
>> james martin. 32. high school geometry teacher.
amateur fly fisher.
>> bio doesn't exactly read "trained assassin.
what's martin's ability?
>> unknown. his dna was in the national database.
set off a red flag.
>> we're doin' that now.
>> you gonna lecture me about civil liberties?
>> no. about sending your men in blind.
unknown means martin could be anything.
he could be a telepath, a teleporter, an invisible man.
each one requires a different tactic.
>> our orders are to take them all in.
>> you're so desperate to chalk up a win, you're cutting corners-- is that it?
>> let's not forget you're nathan petrelli's boy.
and the last crusade was to catch this rebel, and you didn't catch him, did you?
you need a win a hell of a lot more than i do.
>> i love this song.
well, quite a bloodbath in there, isn't it?
did you get my gifts?
>> taxidermied bunny and the near-dead puppeteer... you shouldn't have.
>> it was an overture toward collaboration, since we both want the same thing.
>> and what's that again?
>> killing people like me.
I think we should pool our resources.
>> what's in it for you?
>> let's just say you fascinate me.
and you're in way over your head in there.
I can help you... if you want.
I can find the guy who killed your agents.
>> i want eyes on every road, every terminal, air, bus, roadblocks.
this isn't a drill, people. three of our own died.
and they will not die in vain. not on my watch.
not on yours.
so remember your training.
remember agents whitman, price, and holiday and their families.
remember, we don't sleep...
until this son of a bitch is caught.
any questions?
>> nice speech. >> we need a win.
you have 20 years' experience with these people, and i need a plan.
and i don't wanna hear, "one of us, one of them.
>> then i won't say it. but it got the job done.
the very same tactics that you used on all those counter-insurgency programs you ran from havana to kabul.
>> i don't know what you're talking about.
>> no. right. okay.
well, if you did know what i was talking about, then you'd probably understand the value of co-opting the native population.
working the enemy.
a little focused manipulation goes a long way.
>> how could you work with these people?
trust them?
>> who said anything about trust?
they're assets-- weapons to be mobilized.
motivate them.
greed, revenge, love, hate
whatever it takes to make the collar.
speaking of which...
I have reason to believe that sylar is here...in d. c.
this could be the win that we both need.
>> or it could be another chapter in the big book of you letting him slip through your fingers.
no. i, uh...
got another assignment for you.
>> voila.
>> where'd you get that? >> i sold my kidney.
actually, both of them. twice.
I found a pawn shop down the street.
sold the necklace my dad gave me.
my other dad.
>> you didn't have to do that.
>> i didn't want to, but he's mr. survival skills, and if he knew we were in a pinch and didn't sell it, he'd be mad. >> i expect he would.
it's a nice gesture, but i got everything under control.
this isn't exactly a simple situation here.
>> it seems simple to me.
government agents are out there hunting innocent people, and they're gonna keep going until you tell them to stop what you started.
>> would it kill you to show me just a little bit of gratitude?
>> for what? >> for what?
>> for--for giving you a free pass.
for risking my neck to save your life when it was over.
pick one--either one.
just common courtesy, claire.
>> why did you give me a free pass?
>> i had my reasons.
>> be back.
>> what are you gonna do with it?
>> turn it into more.
gentlemen. is that tequila?
>> the mass is ended.
may you go forth in peace and love and serve the lord.
>> you think sanctuary's gonna stop the agents from coming?
>> i can't sleep, peter.
to find where we should go, what we should do, i need to dream, and to dream i need to sleep, and i can't.
I haven't. not for a long time.
>> take a pill. >> doesn't work.
for the dreams to come, ones that matter, sleep has to be natural, has to be earned.
>> earned.
>> i always found peace here.
your father and i were married in this church.
we walked down this aisle.
your first communion...
even nana's funeral.
you're probably too young to remember, but you held my hand.
there used to be love in this family once.
look at us now.
it's all my fault.
>> you come here to be forgiven?
>> i'm not sure even god has that in him.
you boys wanna make this a little more interesting?
>> what'd you have in mind?
>> listen. come on, let's go.
>> $100 a hit. last man standing takes all.
listen, i can do this.
I used to do this scraping for shore leave money in the philippines, all right?
I'm good at it.
>> fine. >> all right.
>> go for it.
>> all right, boys.
line 'em up.
>> jenkins. >> sir. i wanted to check in.
see if there was anything else i could do.
>> no. just try to get some rest.
>> i wanted to tell you that what you said earlier about the guys...
it was inspirational.
I wish i had your strength.
>> hello.
>> special delivery.
>> how the hell did you get in here?
>> well, you'd be amazed what you can do with a lifted i. d. badge, a $4 tie, and a west baltimore accent.
[Chuckles] but you've got much bigger problems.
done some homework about that killer of yours.
>> i don't need your help.
>> well, i just found some evidence to the contrary.
there's another body.
he stashed it, you missed it. i found it, of course.
>> you're lying.
>> look in the box.
>> what's in the box? >> your answer.
how james martin was able to shoot your men in the back so easily.
it's because of what he can do.
he's a shape-shifter.
come on.
>> where is he?
>> just around the northeast corner.
>> 'scuse me.
>> hey--hey, i didn't do anything.
>> take him in. >> [groaning]
>> your coat's sopping wet. found this one in the bins.
it looked like something you'd wear.
>> well, it should. it's mine.
I made a donation last week.
it's supposed to go to someone who needs it.
>> you need it. come on.
didn't know you were still so active.
>> oh. i give them things.
not devotion, not myself. not the same.
it's like with you and your brother.
your father and i supported you, but we didn't give you support.
>> sure, you did. >> oh, peter.
there were times when you were growing up, you were so confused.
you were so desperate for answers, and i could have told you the truth.
I could have given you comfort.
I didn't.
you must hate me.
>> i'm gonna find you a cup of tea.
it'll help you sleep.
I don't hate you.
look, whatever's happened, you're still my mother.
>> i'm afraid that unconditional love isn't really love at all.
>> hey, why don't we just call it a draw?
you guys don't look so good.
>> nonsense.
>> you don't have to do this, you know.
>> yeah, i do.
we need the money, don't we?
besides, your dad's not the only one who can...
your other dad...
he's not the only one who can do stuff, you know.
Ah...
you better get your old man off to bed.
>> you need a rematch, huh?
how 'bout a rematch? >> uh-uh, no, man.
I beat him fair and square.
>> come on, what about... winning a little bit more?
hmm? >> what do you have in mind?
>> what about this watch? it's a pretty nice watch, huh?
>> it's a really nice watch, but...
I'm like...22 shots deep.
you're a little bit late for the party.
then i'd better catch up, huh?
>> you're not the only one who can get the drop on someone.
>> oh, you've been waiting here for me.
>> your m. o.'s predictable enough.
you desperately wanna find martin so you can get that ability, don't you?
>> i have plenty of powers. >> [chuckles]
but this is different.
shape-shifting. you're salivating.
I read your profile. [thunder crashing]
how you like to take on accents, affectations.
play characters. >> it's fun.
>> it's sad...you're so desperate to be someone else.
you want out.
>> you have no idea what i want.
>> shape-shifting. it's your escape hatch.
course, i could save you the trouble...
end it all for you, right now.
>> the part of my brain that you'd need to hit to kill me...
is microscopic.
>> i'm a pretty good shot. >> it's not that simple.
>> i also gotta jam something in there, right?
to make it stick.
>> well...[chuckles]
you've clearly thought all of this through, haven't you, except for the part where you can't catch your guy without my help.
>> you're all the win i need. the white whale.
>> maybe...i'm the goose who lays the golden egg.
I can round them all up.
>> you suggesting that i can't?
>> you chased a shape-shifter.
you don't chase... a shape-shifter.
just one... photo on that board...
just one...
and i could help you find them all.
then you can take your shot.
>> i asked to be extraordinary.
and i promised to make the world a better place.
so when i got my chance, i lived up to my end of the bargain.
for what?
I'm running for my life.
a lot of people are running for their lives.
they're hurt and they're dying, and i can't...help them.
do you even care what you put people through?
I mean, when i kneel here before you and i ask for help, do you even listen?
and i'm tired of fighting.
and i'm angry.
I'm angry at my father, nathan...
and my mother.
at you.
we had a deal.
I think it's about time you lived up to your end.
please, just...
show up.
>> i want the perimeter locked down.
>> excuse me...
what do you people think you're doing?
>> sit down, sir.
>> sir, we have reason to believe the church is harboring two fugitives.
chain the doors.
no one gets in or out, you understand?
>> yes, sir.
>> this is a waste of time.
Martin's halfway across the country by now.
>> no, he's not. he hasn't left the city.
he had his chance, and he didn't take it.
he showed up as agent jenkins right under your nose.
>> yeah, why would he do that? >> martin's only human.
we all crave routine. we just need to find his.
>> you got some special power for that?
>> i do. but i don't need it.
you can tell everything about a person from their belongings.
I thought you'd be better at this.
>> why's that?
>> 'cause you're a shape-shifter too.
I've been to your apartment-- you've got no books, no art, no keepsakes, no correspondence.
nothing to define you.
>> this is the part where you get under my skin.
I've seen your file too.
>> must be very hollow and boring.
not like martin's closet.
I've never seen so many costumes.
>> not much call for a geometry teacher to wear an armani suit.
>> or scrubs...or this.
it's fractured.
disjointed.
he's trying on personalities like clothes.
>> has he made a choice? >> not yet.
like all of us, he's still looking.
>> what's the common denominator here?
lawyer, doctor, priest?
>> power.
these roles give martin something he could never find in real life.
>> why? >> why does anybody want power?
to screw with people...
or to simply screw people.
tell me what you notice about all those pictures.
>> martin isn't in any of them.
or these are all...martin.
>> hmm. different men of power with different women of allure.
it's a cliche for a reason, and it's marvin's routine.
>> where is he?
>> where he goes every night...
lookin' to fall in love.
garden of eden what do you weigh, like a buck ten?
>> that's none of your business.
>> well, i'm just sayin', man.
you just don't even look drunk.
[slurring] i think that you're just jealous that i caught up.
>> yeah. after i put your old man to sleep.
>> oh, please. that's not hard.
he tends to bite off more than he can chew.
>> he's pretty slick, but he seems like a good guy.
>> he wants to be.
free passes and... swooping in and...
taking me off to mexico, thinking that's all he has to
>> i get it. my parents are divorced too.
>> no. it's not like that.
mayb i just wish he would take off his armor, shining or otherwise, ju a le humng thank you!
we need to go.
Hey, come on. we gotta go.
I won the money.
>> right there, that door. >> all right, i'll get it.
>> you got it?
>> i'm checking every one.
>> i'm sorry, peter. >> mom, you need to be quiet.
>> no. this may be our last chance together, and there are things i have to say
>> you don't have to say anything--it's okay.
>> listen to me! i was just like you.
my head in the clouds, full of hope.
I was gonna be a teacher.
and then my power manifested, and the dreams came.
visions of a bloody future of deceit and death
the apocalypse.
and when i woke... i tried to warn everyone, but no one would listen.
why would they? why should they?
I was cassandra screaming that the sky was falling, but when they looked up, there was no cloud in sight.
and i did it with lies...
and with manipulation...
and betrayal.
and it cost me everything
my friends, my husband, my boys.
>> mom. >> but peter...
it's the price i chose to pay to save the world.
[clunk] >> shh!
>> all clear.
>> you heard him. back up.
>> guess who's here?
>> where? which one?
>> i suppose that fits the pattern
a position of power, authority, significance.
I think you'll recognize him.
>> remember what happened last time you chased him.
>> what's he up to?
why me?
>> he's after power.
he thinks that's something you have.
he's trying to convert the power into love.
he's doing a pretty good job of it too.
he's a better you than you.
>> where'd he go?
>> okay. you should...
never, ever...
fly in that condition....
>> how are you not...
>> ah, the whole tissue regeneration thing
I think it includes my liver tissue.
>> oh, yeah?
I didn't know that.
I'm so sorry, claire.
>> let me...help.
>> i really messed up. >> it's all right.
it's fine.
>> it's not fine.
you know what i did when i found out about you?
I did what i always do.
I denied there was a problem, just like i'm doing right now.
>> you know, we should probably...
have this conversation in the morning.
>> the truth is, claire, i get a pit in my stomach every time i think of you.
it was just so stupid the way i handled it.
you know, i thought if i... kept my distance...
when the time was right, we would...
catch up.
but look at you.
I missed my chance. you're all grown up.
>> hardly.
>> you wanna know why i gave you a free pass?
because i thought in one move, i could win you over.
look, right now i'm using you as an excuse to hide behind this mess that i'm
you know what?
I know everybody's counting on me to fix it.
and i wanna try. i'm gonna do it for everybody.
peter...my mom...
for you.
I'm gonna fix it all.
I'll make it all...
>> i lost him.
>> me too.
>> i guess he's gone.
for good this time.
let's go.
>> you killed him.
>> no.
he's still alive.
wait.
can you do it without leaving...
>> good morning.
>> morning.
>> you really bailed me out with those kids last night.
I appreciate it.
>> that's what family's for, right?
so what's the plan?
are we going straight to washington?
>> no. look, i-i didn't make any calls to anybody.
I don't really have any friends on the hill at the moment.
>> but last night, you said that you would fix everything.
>> i was drunk.
I'm sorry if i got your hopes up.
>> there's gotta be something that you can do.
>> i'm wide open if you got any ideas.
Claire, i overreached.
I screwed up...and now it's just way beyond my control.
some things are bigger... than one man.
>> you know what?
over the years...
I couldn't help but...
think about my real dad...
who you were, what you looked like, your job... and then i met you.
and you were more amazing than anything i could have ever imagined.
>> it's just a fantasy. >> no!
no, it doesn't have to be!
you can do anything you want.
you can fly!
>> claire.
>> you're supposed to be superman.
>> feeling better?
>> i slept...
and i had a dream.
>> what about?
>> that.
or should i say "her"?
I know what we have to do now.
first...we need to go find nathan and claire, and we need to bring this family together.
and then we need to go visit my sister.
>> sister?
>> so where they headed anyway?
>> there's a quarter past ocho to san diego.
what time is it?
>> i got nothin'.
>> what happened to your watch?
>> i'm heading back up, you know.
>> good.
>> comin'?
>> in this dirty old part of the city where the sun refused to shine people tell me there ain't no use in tryin'
my little girl, you're so young and pretty and one thing i know is true you're gonna die before your time is due i know see my daddy in bed a-dyin'

>> so how did that feel...
zipping up that body bag?
cathartic.
poetic.
and tactically fortunate.
I'll be a lot easier for us to operate...
if everybody thinks i'm dead.
>> if we do this...
we succeed...
you'd be the only one left.
>> funny how that works.
>> we gotta get out of this place if it's the last thing we ever do girl, there's a better life for me and you
chapter Ten "1961."
this is just wrong...
digging up these graves.
why is she making us do this?
mom has her reasons, Pete.
she'll share when she's ready.
give her time.
come on, give him a chance.
Why?
look what he's turning us into.
he knows what he's done.
and he's carrying enough guilt for all of us.
but he's here, isn't he?
he needs our support.
boy, he charmed you.
don't worry. It happens to all of us.
I'm gonna go talk to her.
What're we doing here, mom?
you said we came here to find your sister.
we didn't know you had a sister.
look, we need some answers.
mom, what happened out here?
1961/2/1
Angela...
angela and Alice Shaw.
good. That's everybody.
welcome to coyote sands.
my name is Dr. Chandra Suresh.
please follow me.
take a snack.
playground.
the dining room.
game room.
we show movies every night.
and the best popcorn you've ever had.
you have a funny accent.
so do you.
so where are you from?
Bombay, India.
I've come a long way to meet you, to help you.
these are your quarters.
and your parents are just across the quad.
Dr. Zimmerman will show you the way.
why do they have guns?
it's alarming, I know.
but this isn't a prison.
the guards are here for your protection.
we want to keep you safe.
come on, let's get you settled.
I see you got the milk and cookies.
we wanted to give you the official welcome.
welcome to crapola sands.
I'm Charles Deveaux.
the guy with the funny accent is Daniel Linderman.
and the guy with the glasses is Bobby Bishop.
I didn't think boys were allowed in the girls bunk.
uh, yes, yes.
well, um, Bobby here...
he--he wanted to tell you
how beautiful he thought you were.
I-- I did not...
what?
you don't think she's beautiful?
anyway, we just wanted to say hi.
I don't like this.
I want to be with mom and dad.
we already talked about this.
it's going to be fun.
just like camp.
let's get you unpacked.
there's only toys and books in here.
you said pack what I need.
you need clothes, Alice.
pants, shirts, socks.
and how many times have you read Alice In Wonderland?
I want to go home, Banana.
and so do you.
prom is coming.
the doctor told mom and dad that this place.
is going to make my nightmares go away.
no more screaming?
but what I have is genetic.
so we all need to deal with it.
the entire family.
who snuck you out to see Sleeping Beauty?
and who gave Jackie Jacobs an Indian burn when she stole your barrette?
I will always be there for you.
I promise.
but I need you to be there for me, too.
see? Everything is going to be fine.
mom?
my sister, my parents...
they all died here.
and if we don't come together,
if we don't settle our differences...
I'm afraid this street would repeat itself.
1961...
it was a different time.
kennedy was president, and we were all patriots.
and when the government found out about us,
they told us they could cure us.
and we believed them.
and they rounded us all up, and they put us here.
what happened here?
I don't know. I was lucky; I survived.
but Alice, my entire family... didn't.
so why are we here, mom?
you could've told us this in a restaurant.
why here?
why are we digging up those bodies?
I've been dreaming about my sister.
alive.
that doesn't make sense.
but my dreams often don't.
they're open to interpretation.
They--they're confusing, but I think--I think...
I have to see her for myself.
I have to find her body, find a
piece of cloth or something.
anything to give her a proper burial.
you should've told us about this place.
that--that you had a sister.
I didn't want you to know the pain.
mothers are allowed to do that.
I'm allowed to protect you.
you're absolutely allowed to do that, ma.
it's my nightmare, Peter.
I never wanted you to know what I suffered.
I tried to forget.
we made everyone forget.
who's "We"?
how do you think The company was formed?
it started here with a vow to never let this happen again.
we destroyed files.
erased memories.
we blackmailed, we killed.
anything to keep our existence secret.
and it worked...for 50 years.
now Noah and I have tried to fix this current situation,
but Mr. Danko has proved resourceful.
so that's what you were trying to do.
Yes.
but you blew it.
Yeah.
the important thing is to put our secret back...
so we can all stop running, return to our lives.
it's time to go back to the old methods.
you mean erasing people's memories and killing?
it's a necessary evil.
I'm sorry what happened here, mom.
but it didn't give you the right to do the things that you've done,
and it still doesn't.
we need you, Peter.
I need you.
your company tore this family a part,
I'm not going to be a part of it again.
Peter!
I'll get him.
you had a nightmare.
what's it to you?
I think I heard you talking to your sister about how your nightmares come true.
look, you're not the only one who's realized
that something strange is happening to them.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Linderman. - How'd a pretty skirt like you
get a scar like that?
a bicycle accident.
this place is one big science experiment.
and we're the rats.
you're wrong.
they're going to help us.
she's right.
we're freaks.
they're going to make us normal.
and you're blind.
why do you think they have armed guards?
we've done nothing wrong.
it's not like we're communists.
my dad said we can trust them.
this has happened before.
Nazis with the Jews.
america did it too...with the Japs.
this is different.
we're different.
what was your nightmare?
my dreams are confusing.
they're not always right.
you have to stop being afraid...
and start believing.
that doctor...
don't trust him.
What're you talking about?
nothing.
we're all going back to sleep.
my feet are cold, Banana.
that's what you get for not bringing any socks.
I'll find you some.
say good night, Alice.
good night, Alice.
I heard what you were saying to the boys.
about doctor Suresh.
those boys just have an overactive imagination.
remember when I got an F in history?
dad took away the TV and dessert.
I was so mad that I
that night, a hail storm smashed his car.
so?
I think I can control the weather.
is doctor Suresh going to come for me?
why didn't you tell Nathan and Peter about your sister?
Where's your father?
I asked for some alone time with you.
I want to help you.
I was almost your age when I came here.
I was 16.
every other thought was about boys and the prom.
I was so naive.
I wish I had had half of your strength.
you have courage and self confidence.
you--you've overcome all those nagging self-doubts.
maybe sometimes.
not always.
I'm still figuring it out.
you dug up those graves without batting an eye.
if I had had your spirit,
if I had trusted myself,
maybe things would've been different here.
doesn't answer my question.
you ever do something so awful,
something you are so ashamed of
that you think if you ever talk about it,
you might never stop crying?
where did this come from?
this is what happened in my dream.
it's impossible!
but it is...
it's her!
it's Alice!
something you are so ashamed of
that you think if you ever talk about it,
you might never stop crying?
where did this come from?
this is what happened in my dream.
it's impossible!
but it is...
it's her!
it's Alice!
dad!
Alice!
Alice!
come on! We got to get back inside.
you need to see a menu?
no, just a cup of coffee, please.
Pete, we need to get through.
whatever it is, it's between us.
you're not helping things by running away every time things
run away?
so when you just disappear,
you up and disappear and go forever.
you went instead of staying in Washington
and dealing with a problem that you created.
Pete, you know, nobody can look down their nose at me better than you.
1986 Mets. you remember that?
Yeah.
how dad had two tickets to the world series,
and he had two other tickets to the playoffs.
and you convinced me to go to the play-offs with him.
I wanted to make sure you got to see a game
come on, Pete,
I couldn't have known the Mets were gonna beat the Astros.
come on, you got to see Mookie Wilson in that game six.
you saw him.
I got lucky.
you got to see that game. - I got lucky.
you think I conned you?
into seeing a play-off game?
Yes. I do.
because even in your generosity,
Nathan, you are selfish.
and that is just who you are.
Pete...
we have got to find a way to forgive each other.
we have to find the capacity for forgiveness.
because without that... - I am trying...
really hard.
this is the emergency broadcast network.
a severe storm warning is in effect
for the greater valley area.
Claire!
Claire!
how did you find me?
are there more agents coming?
I'm not working with them anymore.
I tried to stop them from the inside.
and they found out.
you expect me to believe that?
it's the truth. I tried...and I failed.
angela Petrelli brought us here.
Why? What business does she have here?
she was taken here as a child.
this was a place for people with abilities,
experimenting, and eventually murder.
what?
they killed hundreds.
the graves are outside.
What're you doing here?
I found this.
50 yea ago, my father was a doctor here.
I came to find out what he was doing.
now, I'm not so sure I want to know.
Hello, Alice.
Angela, can I talk with you?
Yes, of course, Dr. Suresh.
it's okay, Alice.
three wavy lines.
who are they?
don't worry about them.
just focus on the cards.
okay?
let's try again.
a triangle.
I'm not reading your mind if that's what you think.
I had a dream about this, about you showing me cards.
a dream?
about this exact moment?
and does everything you dream come true?
they're dreams, they're confusing.
and what else have you dreamt about?
about you.
you're going to kill everybody here.
my parents.
my sister.
I can assure you...
that's not going to happen.
you are a good man.
and you've treated us with nothing but kindness.
but I'm telling you
it's going to get out of your control.
if you leave, it destroys all our work.
don't you see the benefits
your abilities could have for the world?
I only see my nightmares.
einstein said, "the life of the individual has meaning
only as so far as
it aids in making the life of every living thing
nobler and more beautiful."
you have read Einstein.
no, I just dreamt that you would say that.
you said yourself that dreams are confusing.
open to interpretation.
everything is going to be fine, Angela.
Now...this won't hurt a bit.
I tried to warn them!
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to save them, save Alice.
and now Alice is alive.
if this is your sister, then why is she doing this?
she's angry.
you don't believe me.
storms happen.
it's my sister!
what if it's not?!
no. I need to go find her.
I need to deal with this alone.
No! It's too dangerous out there!
are you okay?
what is it?
your mom. She's gone
so what?
my father was Dr. Mengele?
you don't know what happened here.
it's hard to ignore facts.
which are what?
he worked here.
everyone died, he survived.
the most obvious answer is usually the right one.
working with the enemy
doesn't necessarily make you the enemy.
you should know that.
I met your father. He was a good man.
you don't know what he did, what he faced.
what his intentions were.
who are we talking about?
just, don't make any assumptions.
not until you know the truth.
any sign of my mother?
no. Nothing.
she's got to be around here somewhere.
let's split up.
cover more ground that way.
no one should be alone.
Suresh...
will you go with Peter?
there's no sign of her.
do you really think her sister survived this?
I don't know.
what was this place?
it's where he experimented on them.
I guess we're destined to repeat our parents' mistakes.
how do you mean?
I mean I am my father's son.
experimenting on human guinea pigs.
and why?
not for science.
for self interest.
you're being too hard on yourself, Mohinder.
we started this a long time ago, okay? You and me.
I know you. You're a good person.
good intentions only go so far, Peter.
I am weak.
I'm corruptible.
and I am selfish. - We're all selfish.
my brother has proven that point time and time again.
I know what it's like to have parents who are...
less than.
my mother brought us here
because she wants to start a new company.
she thinks it's the only way to keep this
from happening again.
but that first company she started was corrupt.
Yes, but why?
and was it surviving this?
I mean, this has to come with
with fear and pain and anger.
maybe that's why you can get it right...
because you never knew this pain.
I have to believe that there is hope for redemption.
I have to.
even for Nathan.
you and Peter going to be all right?
I don't know.
he blames me for everything.
can't say as I entirely disagree.
you and I have made a mess of things.
Yes, we did.
Danko is working with Sylar.
Sylar can change his shape. He can be anybody.
he almost made me kill my wife.
what was the last book you read?
cause I can't remember.
not the last book I read...
last movie I saw...
you remember movie nights?
we used to rent old movies...
make popcorn.
when do we get to go back?
I don't know.
I miss it, too.
you know, I should be a basket case.
digging up graves.
I should be, but I'm not.
I'm just...not.
I tried so hard to impress you.
both of you.
becoming an agent, trying to stop the bad guys.
what you did was very brave.
I was an idiot.
all I wanted to do was grow up.
honey, that's all any teenager ever wants.
but you can't fault yourself for that.
maybe not.
maybe I can.
there was a time where I wanted to become a doctor.
a chef. Class president.
not an agent.
say your goodbyes, all right? - Are you sure?
do we have to go right now?
Yeah. Linderman and Bob are already on the outside.
we're gotta go right now, while they're changing guards.
it's our best chance to sneak out.
figure out where we are, how we can get help.
and save everyone.
look, this is your plan.
I know. it's just Alice
look, she can't come.
it's dangerous.
she'll slow us down.
I promised her I'd never leave her alone.
I get it.
but we need you too.
so keep her calm.
make sure she doesn't blow this.
how?
lie.
what were you talking about?
me and the boys are going to go sneak out tonight.
cool, I'm coming too.
no.
why not?
because you can't, okay?
I just want to hang out with kids my own age.
are you going to make out?
no, don't think like that.
we'll be back in a few.
cover for us.
I'm scared.
listen.
I had a dream last night.
about you.
and it's going to be safe here.
I swear.
you just have to stay here.
we'll be right back.
now say good night, Alice.
good night, Alice.
Alice...
look at me.
please, just...
turn around.
talk to me.
may 1961, coyote sands cafe.
the cops don't believe me.
come on, we have to convince them.
someone.
this is serious and you guys are acting like children.
we're enjoying the moment.
do you want a fry?
come on.
let's have a dance.
you missed your prom,
and you love this song.
I never told you that.
we don't allow that in here.
no dancing. Not with a colored.
we didn't mean anything by it.
just pretend like this never happened.
your ability?
we don't have to be afraid, Angela.
socks!
we need to get socks.
for Alice.
this is the emergency broadcast network.
a severe storm warning is in effect.
flash floods and high winds have come out of nowhere.
we have to get back to Alice.
now!
I'm alive.
you're not going crazy.
I almost didn't recognize you.
you look so old.
do I look old?
no.
you look beautiful.
Alice, how is this possible?
how?
have you been here for 50 years?
when I found this place, it was packed with food.
when I went through that, I did what I had to do.
I stole...what I needed.
clothes, food, stuff.
why did you stay?
you told me.
your dream.
you said I'd be safe if I stayed here.
I
and I trusted you.
I thought I'd be safe here.
and the world would be safe...
from me.
from you?
Oh, Alice.
the night I left...
what happened that night, Alice?
when you left...
that doctor...Suresh...
he came for me.
no.
Alice...
stop!
Alice! Alice, wait! Alice!
it's okay. It's okay, Alice!
it's okay!
Alice!
sorry.
get back inside now!
you don't have to stay here anymore.
let me help you.
it's time to go home.
I have socks for you.
since that night, whenever I feel lost...
whenever I don't know what to do...
I steal socks for you.
to remind myself there are simple ways
to protect the ones we love.
you don't ever have to be cold again.
I am so sorry.
Oh, banana! it's not your fault.
Yes, it is.
I lied to you... that night.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I was trying to protect you.
I was trying to save you. - You...
I'm so sorry.
you...
you... - I'm so sorry!
mom!
calm down!
Alice, calm down!
calm down!
No!
no...
I have to talk to her.
she's going to kill you.
no, I have to talk to her.
Alice!
stop!
this isn't their fault.
this is your family.
this is my son.
he's your nephew, Alice.
you have a family.
and they're the only ones who can make everything all right.
don't punish them for my mistakes.
I am so sorry.
come on.
let's get out of here.
let's go home.
say goodbye, Alice.
No!
Alice is gone.
she's nowhere.
judging from her reaction,
I think I know what my father was doing here.
your father...
I found this.
in the lab.
it might give you some answers about your father.
I don't know...
the storm covered the graves. They're all buried.
maybe it should remain that way.
fair enough.
let's get out of here.
I'm not going with you, Peter.
why not?
maybe you're ready to move on.
but I'm not.
I'm not ready to forgive myself.
not yet.
we can never let this happen again.
not ever.
no one can know about us.
they already do.
not for long.
I had a dream...
about the future.
we're going to form a group.
a company.
it's going to protect people like us.
we're just kids.
not anymore we're not.
what do we do in this dream?
whatever we have to.
they're right to be afraid of us.
the things we can do...
the things we're going to do to keep this secret safe.
it's a necessary evil.
I'm never going to see her again.
you don't know that.
I get it, mom.
the guilt, the...
but you got to let go of that.
come join us?
come on.
okay, please someone say something.
how are the fries?
look, this isn't a company.
this is a family.
there's a big difference.
families have the capacity for forgiveness.
you mean that?
we're stronger together than we are apart.
so there's no more hunting.
we've got to make our existence secret.
and try to put our lives back together.
all right, so what now?
I'll go back to Washington.
take ownership of my mistakes.
and talk to the president.
looks like you already have.
the only real way to bring change
is to bring real purpose back to the white house.
and I promise you...
who the hell is that? -That change will come - To this country. - Sylar.
and nothing...
will ever be the same.
thank you all very much.
I'll take a few questions.
Elizabeth.
Yes, sir, thank you.
the American people are in financial crisis now...
to be continued...
there are nearly seven billion people on this planet.
chapter Twelve "An Invisible Thread"
each one, unique, different.
what are the chances of that? And why?
is it simply biology,
physiology that determines this diversity?
a collection of thoughts, memories, experiences that carve out our own special place?
outside Arlington, Virginia
or is it something more than this?
perhaps there's a master plan
that drives the randomness of creation.
something unknowable that dwells in the soul,
and presents each one of us
with a unique set of challenges
that will help us discover who we really are.
you okay?
did you have a dream?
it's Nathan.
what about him? - He's...
he's what?
in trouble.
he's not the only one.
what is it, Noah?
that construction work we passed about a mile back
wasn't real.
there's going to be a road block a half a mile or so ahead.
this is where you get out.
okay, head two miles in that direction.
and then follow the surface streets into the city.
what are you going to do?
I'm going to buy you some time.
here. It's a secure line.
I will find you.
get to Nathan and make sure it is him.
he'll be on Sylar's trail by now.
but dad, I... - listen to your father.
I love you, Claire bear.
is there a problem, officer?
Nathan Petrelli's Senate Office, Washington D. C.
what are you doing?
I told you, I need you to be Taub.
I'm not interested in what you need.
I'm...
such a waste. You could've been so helpful.
just didn't know your place.
Eddie, Gordon, send a clean up crew to...
that hurt.
Shape-shifting, gotta love it, right?
the changes don't just happen on the outside, either.
you remember that little knife off switch in the back of my head?
I moved it.
go ahead, get it over with.
my men will be here any second
to collect Petrelli.
I know.
I got plans for them.
I have plans for all of us.
you going to kill him?
later.
right after I absorb all of his memories.
it's a little ability Angela Petrelli
fed me like a snack.
because Nathan...
and by Nathan, I mean I...
have a rendezvous with destiny tomorrow.
the president's giving a speech at the Stanton Hotel.
senator Petrelli's going to be there
to have a little meeting with him right afterwards.
what for?
nothing.
just to shake his hand.
and when I do...
I'm going to be the most powerful man in the world.
you better kill me now.
because there's no way I'm going to let that happen.
no, I don't need to kill you.
because in 30 seconds,
there's not a person on this planet
who'll believe a word you say.
man down! Man down!
I've got him. He's in here.
you son of a bitch.
the Capital Washington D. C.
you think there's a chance he didn't get caught?
Noah? No. That was his plan all along.
I don't know how my dad always manages
to get himself in the middle of everything.
because he puts himself there.
mostly because of you.
you have no idea the lengths a parent will go
to ensure the safety of their child.
something I hope you never have to find out for yourself.
now...
this is where I get off.
what do you mean?
I just wanted to make sure you got here safely.
I'm not going in there with you to see Nathan.
why not?
because I need to go find Matt Parkman.
is this about your dream?
in it, Parkman saves Nathan's life.
okay, so why don't you just come up
and warn Nathan and tell him how to avoid danger?
that's not how it works.
I cannot change what I dreamed.
but I can help push its outcome.
now you go find Nathan.
and I will find you later.
Nathan.
wake up.
wake up.
you want to be convincing
when you meet the president today, right?
I'm going to need all those sick little
twisted memories of yours.
such a lightweight.
to hell with it.
got plenty of memories from all this stuff
you've got lying around here, anyway.
your diploma says
you graduated with honors from Annapolis
these cufflinks tell me a different story.
politicians.
sir, someone here to see you.
she claims to be your daughter?
all right, send her in.
Claire.
I'm glad you finally made it.
I was beginning to get worried about you.
did you find him?
Sylar?
Yeah. But he got away.
he's going to the Stanton Hotel
to meet the president in an hour.
I'm going to intercept the president first
and warn him.
and tell him what?
that Nathan Petrelli is a look-alike?
if I have to, yeah.
blow the lid off this whole thing.
I'm going to do whatever it takes to shut down building 26.
and how do I know this is you?
what are you talking about?
how do I know you're not Sylar?
Claire.
I am me.
we've spent a lot of time together over the past few days.
Mexico.
I was beginning to think you knew me better than anyone else.
sorry.
it's all right.
listen.
why don't you stay here?
I've got a car taking me to the Stanton Hotel.
lay low until I can clean this whole mess up.
no, I want to come with you.
in case anything goes wrong.
it's not going to be safe.
so what? I can't get hurt.
and I need to help stop Sylar.
it's time I put myself in the middle of this
and made a difference.
I was thinking exactly the same thing.
you're right.
if things do go south,
I want you right there.
right by my side.
come on.
building 26, Washington D. C.
how are you feeling?
better.
we don't have to do this.
we can turn around right now
I'm okay. It was just a headache.
and a nosebleed
you're getting sick from using your power.
maybe so.
but we have to get inside.
we must save the ones who are being held.
and we must shut down this operation.
then let's use my power instead.
we are a team now.
I'll use my crimson arc to
that's won't be enough.
look at this security.
we have to stop time.
no.
it's too dangerous.
just one more time.
I promise
it's just a headache now.
next, your head could explode.
explode
Really?
then
that's just the chance
I'll have to take.
I bet you're happy to see me.
Sylar...
we've got to stop him.
a lot of help you're going to be.
okay, let's hear it.
lecture.
the finger-wagging, the general "I told you so."
that I screwed up.
refused to listen.
and then you got into bed with Sylar.
that's all over now.
clearly.
that's very zen of you.
no, it's practical.
if we get out of here, we're going to have to throw everybody and everything we have at Sylar,
trying to get a spike into the back of his head.
a spike's not going to cut it anymore.
he moved the spot.
great.
how the hell did you do it?
deal with all of this?
can't capture all of them, can't contain them.
there are no rules.
not even gravity.
it's all about spinning plates.
living in the gray area.
20 years of middle management, becomes second nature.
so in 20 years, I'll get it?
20 years and an adopted daughter.
if I didn't have Claire,
I'd be following the same dogma that took you right over the edge.
I'd be exactly in your position.
you are exactly in my position.
Yeah.
we should do something about that.
together.
good.
we have to find where they keep the prisoners.
Hiro.
your ear
is bleeding.
I'm fine.
come on.
let's hurry.
holy crap!
Hiro.
it's Dr. Suresh.
let's help him down.
I have an idea.
payback is very bitchy.
Hiro?
is this a trick?
I don't know.
no guards.
something's very wrong here.
Hiro.
let's go.
Hiro, what
what happened?
we are rescuing you.
I'll try to repay you later.
but right now, we have to get out of here as soon as we can.
are you okay?
no, he's not.
he has nosebleeds and headaches from stopping time.
Oh, I'm fine.
you're a doctor, right?
then you can help him.
here, open your eyes wide.
your pupils are dilated.
do you have any stiffness in your left arm?
or dizziness?
Yes.
but Bruce Wayne only slept two hours a night.
Hiro! Hiro...
these abilities allow us to do superhuman things,
but you are still human.
and your human body is rejecting these powers,
like, uh...like a virus.
but this power... it is what makes me strong.
my destiny.
you can't freeze time again. Do you understand?
Stanton Hotel Washington, D.C.
Thanks.
so what's the plan?
we just tell them the president's in danger?
that would just send them down a rabbit hole.
and then Sylar can become a rabbit.
so we got to play close to the vest.
follow my lead, okay?
Nathan!
it's good to see you, man.
this is my daughter, Claire. Claire, this is Liam.
Samuels. The president's chief of staff.
I live in America.
your dad and I barely survived boarding school together.
barely.
listen, I really appreciate the president
giving me some time this afternoon.
sure, he just stepped up onstage.
speech usually clocks in about 90 minutes.
whatever works for him.
but I'd like to stick around, close by.
Absolutely. We got a suite upstairs.
come here. Do me a favor.
sign in right here, and Frank will show you -Nice to meet you. -You too.
I thought you were right-handed.
ambidextrous.
I bat righty.
throw lefty.
you coming?
prisoners are gone.
the entire unit's been captured.
seeing as how your unit was trying to kill us,
I think we caught a break.
how the hell did this happen?
I tried to tell you before this whole thing started.
your men alone are never going to be a match for people with abilities.
you sure this will work?
tasers didn't work on Sylar,
but one shot of this will put an elephant down.
the trick is getting close enough to the elephant.
Hiro.
Hiro! Call 9-1-1.
I've got to get to the Stanton.
I've got to stop Sylar.
go, we'll stay with him.
Hello?
thank god. Where are you?
I'm with Nathan.
are you sure it's him?
Oh, it's him. Don't worry.
how do you know?
because it's me.
Oh, god.
this is funny.
don't you love a good pinot?
my dad's on his way.
he's going to stop you.
and then I'm going to kill you.
no.
actually, I'm going to kill him.
or have you kill him.
I haven't decided yet.
don't give me that look.
everybody dies sometime.
well... Almost everybody.
Papa Petrelli, Mama Bennet...
Mr. Muggles.
what's your brother's name again? Larry?
Lyle.
Lyle, right.
hmm, he's going to die too.
as we speak, my father's dying.
did I tell you I got to meet my real dad?
boy, was that a disappointment.
have you ever stopped to think about
how much we have in common, Claire?
you were adopted.
I was adopted.
You...can't die.
I can't die.
Oh, you can die.
I'll make sure of it.
you'll get bored.
after like, 100 years of trying to off me,
watching all of your loved ones drop like flies.
you may eventually come to forgive me.
maybe you'll even love me.
I'll keep trying to kill you.
for the rest of my life.
well, everybody needs a hobby.
I mean, I'm not saying there aren't bridges
that need to be built,
but if we start building them now...
who knows?
you could be my first first lady.
I'm sorry, Senator. There's a full lockdown.
no one gets in or out without talking to Mr. Samuels.
then you better talk to Mr. Samuels.
I have Senator Nathan Petrelli
requesting access to the building.
is there a problem?
he says you're already inside.
if you're here, then who the hell's up in that suite?
I can either know now or after we've taken him down.
you're not going to do that.
you send your men up there, and they will die.
he's right.
his name is Sylar. He's extremely dangerous.
and he's a target? He's one of them?
he's one of them.
He's--got to stop saying that.
he's one of us.
he's one of us.
it's all right.
Liam, I've been lying to the president.
I've been lying to myself.
and I will take full responsibility for my crimes
when the day comes.
but today we're going to course correct.
there's a man in that suite upstairs,
and he needs to be stopped.
and how do you suggest we do that?
you don't.
we do.
Sylar can only be stopped by people like us.
my brother can do whatever Sylar can do,
we just have to get him close enough to touch him.
just give us a five-minute head start.
that's all I'm asking.
I'll take him high, you take him low.
let's cut the son of a bitch in two.
I love you, Pete. You know that?
of course.
I love you too, Nathan.
ready.
go!
are you all right?
Yeah. - Where'd they go?
the window.
can you fly after them?
I can't.
come on, we have to find them.
come on.
Oh, Claire's must be so mad at me.
washington, D.C
it's about time.
Mrs. Petrelli, what are you doing here?
waiting for you. - How did you find me?
I had a dream. Nathan's in trouble.
something terrible happened to him.
and then you save him. I don't know how.
all I know is you have to come with me.
I can't. I'm sorry.
my dreams don't lie, Mr. Parkman.
now I need you to come with me.
I came here to stop those agents from coming after us.
I need to be able to go back to my boy,
and know he can live his life without being hunted.
I'm sorry about Nathan.
then we want the same thing.
and without Nathan, none of that is possible.
you don't have to read minds to know that.
come with me.
we should separate here.
you go that way, I'll look for Nathan over here.
hold it.
Noah?
you tell me that's Claire, not Sylar.
I just fought Sylar, okay. That is Claire.
put the gun down. Dad...
it's me.
did you take his power?
Yeah.
so we can stop him.
Freeze!
on the ground!
the president's life is in danger.
you want him to live? You need to listen to us.
I said on the ground!
you can either listen to me now,
or I'll tell you after you shoot me.
they were here, Peter and Nathan.
I'm sorry.
only authorized personnel beyond this point.
this is a secret service badge.
you're going to let us through.
Oh, sorry.
you guys go ahead.
you don't want to see this.
no, no, I need to.- Mrs. Petrelli.
I need to! - Mrs. Petrelli, don't!
no, I need to!
Nathan! -Please.
Nathan!
I don't understand.
my dream.
you were supposed to save him.
this way, Mr. President.
Nathan.
is that you?
of course it's me.
we're getting the president out through the basement.
I can't give you any more time.
that's all right.
you don't have any more time to give.
this way, Mr. President.
thank god you're all right, sir.
the secret service did a hell of a job today.
and so did you.
this is insane. This will never work.
we'll make it work. - It's the only way.
and it has to be right now.
I don't know how much time I bought
sending Peter and Claire after Nathan.
why don't you just chain him up, huh?
or tranq him; isn't that what you guys love to do?
I don't want to be part of this.
I thought you came back to protect your family, Matt.
I did, but what you're asking me to do is crazy!
who will convince the president
the whole thing was a mistake?
without Nathan, nothing's going to change.
word gets out that a person with abilities
murdered a U. S. senator,
you're going to have 100 Dankos out there.
even if I could do what your asking me to do,
he would never really be Nathan. He'd always be Sylar.
if Sylar can absorb all of Nathan's memories,
then the entire history of anything he touches
will fill in the gaps.
physically, no one will ever know the difference.
it'll be permanent.
look, the last thing in the world I want
is to see that son of a bitch still alive,
and I have to lie to my family about it.
but we need Sylar to be Nathan Petrelli again.
Matt...
you don't do this...
Nathan is gone forever.
and how do we explain what happened to him?
there's a body in deep freeze in building 26.
it's identical. A shape shifter.
your son, Mr. Parkman-- you just wanted to protect him.
can you honestly tell me that if something happened to him,
you wouldn't do anything-- anything
to keep him in your life?
I can't lose Nathan, not like this.
I'm begging you.
you're no longer Sylar.
no longer Gabriel Gray.
that life is over.
Sylar's dead.
you're no longer Sylar--Sylar.
you're no longer...
Sylar.
no longer Gabriel Gray.
your life is over.
Sylar is dead.
you're now Nathan.
Petrelli. Nathan Petrelli.
son. Brother.
father. Senator.
Nathan.
Petrelli.
ma?
we are all connected.
joined together by invisible flame.
infinite in its potential, and fragile in its design.
yet while connected,
we are also merely individuals.
empty vessels to be filled with infinite possibilities.
an assortment of thoughts, beliefs.
a collection of disjointed memories and experiences.
it's a new beginning, mom.
can I be me without these?
can you be you?
I take it the president agreed to it?
funding, resources, deniability.
I told them I found just the man to head up our new...
what were we going to call it?
I always liked "the company."
are you feeling okay?
not really.
it's time for us to go back home, Ando.
I can't believe he's really dead.
he's really dead, Claire.
he really is.
and if this invisible threat that holds us together
were to sever, to cease... What then?
what will become of billions of lone, disconnected souls?
therein lies the great quest of our lives.
to find, to connect...
to hold on.
for when our hearts are pure, and our thoughts in line,
we are all truly one,
capable of repairing our fragile world
and creating a universe of infinite possibilities.
end OF VOLUME FOUR.
volume FIVE "REDEMPTION"
six weeks later
you're number four.
I haven't heard from you in weeks.
I was beginning to worry.
Nathan.
sorry, mom.
just haven't felt like myself lately.
don't be ridiculous.
this is a great time for you, Nathan.
the world's your oyster.
we put all that nonsense behind us.
the family's back together.
this is your time.
now come on. We're gonna be late for lunch.
Nathan...Have you heard a word I've said?
it's just this clock.
it's running a minute and a half fast.
so... lunch?
Italian?
or Chinese?
previously, on heroes...
I think sylar's beginning to emerge again.
I'm part of you, matt. Whatever you did to me, I held on.
now I'm inside your head.
I'm in control here, not the power.
I'm not you, you son of a bitch!
Keppler! The guy's name is keppler. Lives in long beach.
you're supposed to be the man with the plan, remember?
I'm not sure I'm that guy anymore.
Why's that? - Because I've lost my family, angela.
maybe changing your name back to bennet Wasn't such a great idea after all.
but they say college is for reinventing yourself.
have you ever heard of the jump, push, fall test?
all we need is a dummy The approximate size and weight of annie.
so where do we get our hands on a dead body?
I guess she did kill herself.
I met an empath.
you talk to him?
didn't really get a chance.
Claire, it's gretchen. Open up.
Claire, we need to talk!
no, darling, this batch isn't for you.
I think...
I think I found someone to fill joseph's shoes.
I'm going out.
wearing that?
I draw unwanted attention being myself.
haven't worn a suit since I was a boy.
my parents forced us to be prim,
binding us to a life of... Combed hair and...
shined shoes.
and then I discovered I could control the very earth under my feet,
and I was liberated.
I could be filthy.
tie still feels like a damn noose around my neck.
come here.
you don't have to leave.
you know, I could... I could do whatever you want.
no. Thank you.
it's my responsibility.
ever since joseph died, I feel like the lights...
don't shine as bright in here.
feel like I'm missing a part of myself.
he was my compass.
I'm afraid of where we're going without it. I need it back.
I'm sorry for your loss. But you know you cannot replace your brother.
no, you don't understand.
we have a need, and I have a candidate.
I just want to see If he deserves a place at our table.
do you think that you might go home While you're out there?
no. I left that life.
I don't ever want to go back again.
how do I look? - Like everybody else.
are you peter petrelli,
the paramedic who saved that cop's life last week?
that was awesome, man. Here.
Thanks. What's this? - You been served.
guess you need to be more careful When you're saving people, hero.
you expecting somebody, parkman?
suspect's house is over there.
how damn long does it take a judge To issue a warrant?
we are gonna get this guy, okay?
we're gonna find the stash, both get commendations.
it's gonna be a great day. Just relax.
Yeah.
it's not even about that. I
my 30day sobriety chip.
I slipped. I used.
I'm still being haunted By the ghost of all the crappy things I've done past, And it got the better of me.
A. D.A.
I wish I was a ghost. It would be so much better than this hell,
being stuck in your miserable lifeehh!
I mean, have you seen yourself eat a burrito?
why don't you just get the hell out of here?
well, there's only one way out.
which is you need to figure out how to undo what you did.
give me back my body, and I will be happy...
to leave you stewing in your mediocrity.
you're a killer. I'm a cop.
if I have to keep you trapped inside this prison For the rest of my life...
so be it.
you really think you're up to the challenge?
you got no power. None.
you're annoying as hell, yes, but ultimately...Harmless.
I can just ignore you until you fade away Like a bad memory.
we'll see.
we got the warrant. - Good.
I want you on this job.
but you're not going into that house Until I know that you'll keep it together.
I'm fine. Look.
it's the first day of the rest of my life...Right?
so I put away my ghosts and put my game face on.
let's go. - All right.
police, open up! Open up!
I'll check upstairs.
I'm not interrupting you, am I?
I'm everywhere.
where you going? He's in the closet.
your drug dealer is in that closet. What kind of cop doesn't check a closet?
and he has a gun.
you're done. Drop it.
now!
okay!
you're welcome.
I told you that
dad. What are you doing here?
Hey, dad. Nice to see you.
thanks for bringing the housewarming presents.
Hey, dad. Nice to see you.
thanks for bringing the housewarming presents.
you okay? Yeah. I'm fine.
your mother told me About your roommate annie committing suicide.
I should have called you. I know.
I didn't call because no. - No, no, no, I
I don't want to put you on the spot. I just wanna make sure you're all right.
I'm...Dealing with it. I'm fine.
I know that fine. It's, uh...
it's not very convincing. You want to try again?
it's not just the whole annie thing, it's...
it's just an adjustment, college.
I'm adjusting.
I miss my family. I miss you.
mom. Even lyle.
what do you say we grab some lunch?
spend a little time, talk.
if you're not busy. - No.
sounds like a plan.
let me just go get pretty. - You look beautiful.
I'll be just a minute.
so this is your plan?
you're just gonna avoid me?
I'm not.
Wow. You're even gonna avoid admitting you're avoiding me.
no, no, no, I'm not.
I was just busy and and studying and...
organic chem is a bitch.
how's, uh, art history?
so we're really not gonna talk about this?
Look...Whatever it is You thought you saw the other night, You didn't see.
I didn't see you hurl yourself out a window
and then snap your bones back into place?
No! No!
I mean, yes, I was I was on the ground
and I was testing your theory, you know, jump, push, fall,
and I think annie did commit suicide,
which is awful andand tragic.
you don't have to lie to me.
look, you were wrong about annie Just like you're wrong about me.
seriously, what are you... A vampire, an alien?
some kind of freakish government experiment?
all right. I just have to change.
Hi, mr. Bennet.
who's your friend?
Oh, that's, uh, gretchen.
nice to meet you.
Yeah, um...
would you like to join us for lunch?
Oh. That's nice.
you don't you don't have to do that.
it would be my pleasure.
I'm pretty sure that gretchen Has an art history assignment due tomorrow.
isn't that right, gretchen?
Yeah, but I finished my paper already.
and I'm starving. - Great.
great. - Great.
Hey. We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
so why don't you just tell us where you hid the drugs?
why don't you ask my lawyer?
did he just...I can't believe people actually say that.
you can call your lawyer after we're done searching the house.
no, you can't do that, man.
we have a warrant. You attempted to murder an officerme.
so we are gonna stay here as long as it takes.
or you could just grow a pair and...
end this idiotic sobriety.
I'm gonna ask you one more time...
stop asking. Use your abilities.
I'm gonna go check in the bathroom.
not as easy to ignore me as you thought.
it's because I ooze charm.
looking in the wrong place. Stop helping.
Hey, if I'm gonna be stuck in here,
I might as well make the most of it.
I always thought I'd be an excellent cop.
fine. Ignore me.
Something...Doesn't fit in this picture.
stuffed rabbit? a stuffed rabbit!
this house isn't used for drugs.
it's used for something worse.
a lot worse.
Hi. I need a file.
um, hooper, william. Hooper.
look, it'll just take a second. It's my accident report. If you could just type it in.
Seriously?
I get it. You're just, uh, doing your job.
I'm doing my job.
save a guy's life and he... Sues me for it.
I guess no good deed goes unpunished, right?
I'm talking to myself.
who are you listening to?
your headphones.
it's cool. I like that band too.
you okay?
he's in physical therapy right now. Thank you.
scuse me. William hooper?
yes? That's me.
I think there's been a mistake.
I've never met you before.
there's no mistake, mr. Petrelli.
you pulled me from the 424 bus After it crashed at lexington and 53rd.
I remember you were fast, so fast,
so negligent, you dislocated my arm.
well, I remember everybody that was on that bus.
you weren't on it.
what is this, a scam? You recognize my family name?
you want money?
I'm not scamming you. Don't need your cash.
then what? - Empathy.
I'm in town because of my brother joseph.
he died and...
there's a lot of loose ends to take care of When someone passes.
I'm all alone now.
I have to take care of our entire family.
it's my responsibility. It's my burden.
but I can't do that on account of you.
doctor says I won't work for months.
if I don't work, I don't feed my family.
are you the kinda man That's going to allow my family to starve?
you know what? This was a mistake.
I'm gonna let the lawyers handle itgood day.
working two, three shifts at a time.
my lawyer already checked on you.
I know what it's like to feel the pressure of obligation.
but isn't it possible I was on that bus And you've become so spread thin that you...
forgot?
no. It's not.
you're not going blind, emma.
there's nothing wrong with your eyes.
when you saw the lights, did other people see them?
did you ever hear of synesthesia?
Yeah, yeah. People say that they can smell words Or hear numbers.
it's possible. It's very common in deaf cases.
maybe your body's trying to tell you something.
Emma, emma. This is serious.
you know, you are completely disengaged.
you file records when you could be treating patients.
is that why you wear the headphones?
I don't want to see their faces.
okay. We've got saag paneer.
baingan bharta.
aloo gobi.
tikka masala. - Seriously?
it just looks like green, brown, Yellow, and orange.
don't make the stink face. You're gonna love it.
except he forgot the raita.
I don't want to offend your dad, But what if I don't like yellow?
just do the napkin trick. - Sir?
excuse me, we also had an order of raita for the table.
could you bring that out, please? - Clever. You're very good at hiding things.
so, gretchen, what's your major?
physiology and biomechanics.
I thought it was art history.
I'm gonna change.
I'm obsessed with the abilities of the human body.
the other day I saw this girl...
on youtube. She was born with this gene
that doesn't let her feel any pain, like nothing.
and her parents are freaked that she could cut her hand Or burn herself and not even know.
so she's totally cloistered.
pretty cool, huh?
it's unusual, to say the least.
so, what do you think, claire?
wanna audit some of these classes with me?
what do you think, claire?
why would I be interested in that?
because it's awesome, we could do it together, And you're still undeclared.
well, I can be undeclared till, uh, third year.
Yeah, but that's just like denying the inevitable.
how long can you do that for?
you know, this yellow is really good.
yummy yellow.
so, mr. Bennet, what do you do?
retired.
but I'm always finding new reasons to go back to work.
whose do you think this is?
I mean, it's not his daughter. Would you let your kid play here?
Yeah, me neither.
here, I think these keys go up to the garage.
I'm gonna go check it out. - Okay, cool.
I'll keep an eye on him.
okay, tell me what the hell you think you know.
come on, whose stuffed animal is that?
is there a kid here? Tell me.
right. You're ignoring me now?
doesn't feel very good, does it?
somebody has something you want, And they just won't give it to you.
I never intended for this to happen.
unless you did, mr. Parkman.
what the hell's that supposed to me?
your life's a mess, matt.
I'm stuck inside your mind with your powers And all your anxieties.
it's sad.
you're so desperate for anyone to love you
I mean janice or your kid.
and they never will love you. And you wanna know why?
shut up! - I didn't say anything, man!
because you come in at a zero on the confidence scale.
you're always secondguessing yourself.
listen, I'm innocent!
sweating every decision you makeliterally.
I swear! You know what I think?
I think you wanted me in here to help you.
you wanted me to pick your sorry ass up out of the mud And help make you a man.
very good, detective.
you found it all on your own.
I'm almost impressed.
now what are you gonna do, matt?
are you man enough to save her?
you were right, mr. Bennet.
this was outstanding. Thank you.
you're welcome.
that mango lassi just goes right through you. Excuse me.
okay, look - I know things are difficult,
but I can't believe you told her about your ability.
I didn't tell her! She just found out.
I gotta contact the haitian. Erase gretchen's memory.
clean this mess up.
Hey! Gretchen is not the enemy.
she's just a girl, And she's the only friend that I've made.
I appreciate your concern, But I don't need you fighting my battles for me.
I can handle this.
Really? What's your plan, claire?
stop.
you make that phone call, And I swear I will banish you.
I will not call. I will not email.
this is my mess, and I'm gonna clean it up.
so...
what's for dessert?
where is she? - What are you talking about?
this is what I'm talking about, The girl you wrote the ransom note for.
where is she? - There is no girl.
little girl's life at stake, parkman.
you don't have a lot of time.
use your power.
use your power.
under the stairs...
she's under... She's under the stairs.
what did you do? What did you do!
what? Dude, what are you doing?
Parkman! Parkman, what the hell are you doing?
a girl. He killed a girl.
her body's under the stairs.
what girl? The girl!
the girl's body, mike. She's right
what - The stuffed rabbit. Where's the stuffed Pink stuffed - what?
I used your own power... Against you.
you're being sued?
this is a scam.
this guy wasn't even in that bus crash.
according to my log, he was.
the hospital is not gonna take the fall on this.
they're gonna blame you.
for what? I've been nothing but committed.
Yeah, I know. You're everywhere.
always the first on scene.
what's that supposed to mean?
there's a couple of people floating the theory
that you cause the accidents yourself.
glory hounding.
so what, you you believe them?
they ask if you've been reckless,
they ask if you've been behaving suspiciously.
you have. - Hesam, you know me.
we're partners. - Partners?
man, you run off the second we get on scene.
I'm your chauffeur.
he was on the bus.
look, claire, I'm sorry if I push too hard. I push. I'm pushy.
ya think?
you don't want to talk. I get that.
wanted to keep a secret that got out.
when I was in junior high,
the girls called me retching gretchen.
that's a terrible nickname.
Yeah, they said that I smelled like puke
because I was bulimic.
Wow. I can't believe they would make that up.
Yeah. Made it up.
I'll see you around.
I really, really want to trust you,
but my life has been a complex series of disasters,
and...it's been a really, really long time
since I felt safe enough to tell anyone the truth.
but I'm tired of keeping the secret to myself.
so ask me anything.
I'll tell you the truth.
Mr. Petrelli. Didn't expect to see you again.
you look like you've been running all over the city.
I need to apologize to you.
you were on that bus.
I made a mistake, and I am sorry.
thank you.
I'm gonna make it right.
no need to concern yourself.
there must be something I can do.
have you ever lost a brother?
no. No, I haven't.
I used to work hospice.
I used to help families through the worst pain imaginable.
joseph and I grew up nearby.
I thought I'd go back home
to remember the good times.
can't bring yourself to go?
too many bad memories mixed in with the good.
my trip here started as one thing,
but it turned into something else.
can't seem to find any solace anywhere.
grieving is...Messy.
I saw it all the time.
people can offer their condolences.
they can tell you they're sorry for your loss,
but they don't...Know what it is that you're feeling.
what do you say to people?
I just sit with them, Be with them.
I'd let 'em know that they're not alone.
so what made you become a paramedic?
I wanted to save lives instead of watching them pass.
you're exactly who I'd hoped you'd be.
I'm dropping the lawsuit.
thank you, peter, for everything.
you know, it's not for nothing, but if you...
made the trip all the way out here,
I really think that you should visit your home.
I think I will.
sorry to bother you at this hour, But, um...
I grew up here.
my father used to be the butler.
my mother was the maid.
my brother, uh, recently passed away,
and, uh...I just...
thought I could take a look around.
not here, but in the carriage house.
we're actually in the middle of a dinner party.
please. - This really is not a good time.
sorry for your loss.
so wait, you're telling me that you've never been drunk?
because that's like 85% of the college experience.
I know. It just doesn't work on me.
I heal too quickly.
but the good thing is You will always have a designated driver.
can I...See it?
see what?
the healing?
if that's not crossing a line.
the hand's always the favorite.
go for it.
I've never done this before.
well, I would hope not.
it's okay.
I have to take this.
I'll be right back.
dad, I've got everything under control, okay?
and I told gretchen everything about everything,
and I know that you're gonna be mad.
but this was my choice.
it's not just us anymore,
and I'm gonna have other people in my life,
friends and boyfriends,
and I can't close myself off with lies.
did you rehearse that speech? - Yes.
I wanted to get it right.
no, itit was good. Listen, I,um...
I think I owe you an apology.
I was a bit harsh earlier at the restaurant.
a bit? Okay. - Two bits.
it's just...
when I look at you,
I can't help seeing my claire bear, and, uh...
when you get in any kind of trouble, I feel this instinct to protect you.
well, you can't do that now.
I don't think I can ever really do it again.
not like before.
look, I will always be here for you.
always.
but...you're right. You can handle your own problems now.
and I'll try to worry about myself from now on.
Thanks.
good night, dad.
good night, claire.
good night.
can I, uh, borrow this?
no.
right. Sorry.
no, II mean yes.
Yes, but...
well, you won't have to borrow it because...
it'll be here.
do you want to be my roommate?
let me think, um...
rooming with a boring girl who smells like pickles,
or the supergirl who's got excellent taste in literature.
well, all right then.
roomie.
I just...I don't see any other way out of this.
you crossed the line, man.
what's gonna happen to me, mike?
you need to find yourself a damn good lawyer.
this is gonna ruin my life.
I am sorry.
Yeah.
me too.
what are you doing?
I guess I'm just not strong enough anymore.
nothing happened here.
he attacked you. I stopped him.
that's all. Go call it in.
I'll go call it in, matt.
I'm proud of you.
you're finally becoming more like me.
today is...
the first day of the rest of your life.
now, they can all be like this...
or you and I can go find my body.
weird, huh.
sorry to make you boys come out.
three people died here. Could have been a lot worse.
so what happened? - Sinkhole.
sinkhole?
hey there.
whatcha doin'?
homework.
trig.
Ooh.
trig.
Ouch.
damn numbers.
you're too good at math.
umph.
somebody's drunk.
come on, you don't need that math crap.
you don't wanna be stuck doing numbers your whole life.
it's bad on the stomach.
don't be that smart.
I'll dumb it down. Exactly.
you dumb it down.
be creative, feed the soul.
That's...your move.
you should play an instrument or...
paint something.
I always wanted to play the trombone or tuba.
or the flute.
I wanted to be a fluter.
flutist.
ist." Is
delicate, I know.
I'll start with pastels tomorrow.
I wanted to be a poet once too.
I wanted to write poems like that Pablo guy.
Pablo Neruda? Yeah.
him.
I gave it up, though.
it was a little too pansy for me.
more than the flute?
yeah...
tonight I write "the saddest lines...
to think that I do not have her...
come on!
dad.
I love drunk time but I really need to finish this.
okay, okay.
sorry. I'm going.
no, no problem. It's just
it's getting late.
Yeah, it is.
too late.
go easy on the numbers, son.
they're too damn accurate.
life shouldn't be so...
expected.
got it.
night, Dad.
Whoo! My God, the heat.
I can swallow the air.
I swear, it has texture.
get used to it, babe.
what do you think, Johnny?
it works for me.
here's that.
Johnny.
the new family's moving in.
there's a boy.
he's cute.
only one kid, thank God.
we should go over.
they're not going anywhere.
I can't. I have work.
I like the way you're embracing this summer job.
Yeah, great idea. Thanks, Dad.
like I had a choice.
I love waiting on rich kids.
you are a rich kid.
Yeah, a rich kid with a name tag.
told you she'd be fun to have around.
Ah, we got a yapper.
that's gonna get old.
it officially did.
So...it's just me.
what do you really think?
no, it's great, Mom.
you scored.
this is one of the younger developments.
and, uh...
well, the realtor told us that there's several families with kids you age.
are you okay?
I want this to work, honey. For both of us.
well, you want it to be easy.
is that so horrible?
I'm tired of hard, Johnny.
it's not horrible, Mom. It's just...
unrealistic.
all these cabinets, I will never fill them.
Ooh, I think you'll figure out a way to fill them.
uh, what's up for you tomorrow, Johnny?
you gonna check out your new town?
it seems spread out.
it's kind of a hike.
well, you get your license back in six months.
that's not so long.
you can put some air in the tires and my bike is yours.
well, I was thinking about going to a meeting.
Dr. Hill gave me the name of a place.
so soon? We just got here.
well, they suggest I go every day.
it doesn't seem very practical.
that was the plan.
I think we should stick to it.
absolutely, if that was the plan then that's the plan.
in fact, you know what, I'll drive you.
you know, if you want.
new town, new home.
I thought we were done with all that.
that's not how it works, Mom.
Karen, he should go.
I mean, if that's what the farm suggested...
it was a ranch, Bob.
it was a drug and alcohol rehab actually.
well, then, we have a plan.
Lucy, get over here.
right now!
Liza!
Liza!
I'm--I'm fine, Dad.
damn it, Liza!
hush, George.
what happened?
too much nitrate.
too much nitrate?
back inside, George.
we're gonna die in our sleep!
you know I support that brilliant mind of yours, but let's try to find some quieter chemicals to play with, huh?
okay.
Oh!
uh!
have you seen my hand?
Hey!
I'm Cliff Wiatt.
this...Is Anita Grave.
she's my friend, confidante...
real crowd pleaser at Halloween.
Johnny. John!
I used to be friends with Eddie.
he--he lived in your room.
before you.
we played pranks on each other all the time.
keep things hoppin'.
palm Springs isn't exactly the most happening place.
I, uh-- I picked up on that.
good.
it gets better when school starts.
it's just summers tend to suck around here with all this heat.
it makes people crazy.
what grade are you in? 10th.
I'm in 11th.
Yeah, I should be, but. I'm in 10th.
right.
well, Johnny, the thing about this town is...
it's all retir grays, gays, and streets named after dead people.
which means we're in the minority.
people come here to die, so it's the short end of the stick for us.
great.
but...now you're here.
which is good 'cause we're in desperate need of fresh blood.
it's good to meet you, Johnny.
I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
Yeah. Cool.
all right, come on, Anita, let's go.
let's get out of here.
later. Bye.
Hey!
who are you?
Johnny.
why are you following me?
I don't know.
you move into the Nolan house?
and you are?
I ask the questions.
well, come on if you're coming.
where are we going?
that sounded like a question to me.
is this...? Uh!
so...
I gather you walk the golf course at night.
who are you?
cliff! Sugar baby, I need ya.
no, no, it's too soon to take that off.
nonsense.
I am not sitting in this house another day.
mom The doctor should do it.
you're gonna do it.
now, just be careful 'cause the blood is dried.
it's stuck.
Ow.
ow, ow, ow. Hurry!
Hurry!
Oh.
all right, how's it look?
it's bruised, but it looks like the nose two noses ago.
well, that's what we want.
Yes.
all right, a little makeup...
and it's good to go.
you have any idea what goes on in that house?
peeking through the hedges again?
I maintain my own yard, you know that.
I tried your gardener, he's lazy.
Oh, look, there's our new neighbor.
Hello!
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
here, let me
sorry.
that's me, I'm a klutz.
it's okay.
I got it.
I'm--I'm Johnny.
just moved here.
I know.
I'm Liza.
Oh, hi, Liza.
nice meeting you.
see you around. Okay.
we are so happy to have you, Karen.
we never thought the house would sell so quickly
Helen is the president of our Homeowners Association.
be warned. We'll get you involved.
it's a great way to meet everybody.
we have some wonderful families.
and if they're not the Madam President here will quickly plan their demise.
Blaire, stop.
I'm overly protective of our little community.
it only takes one wrong element.
I'm the Mayor's wife. She can't touch me.
Yes, you are. His third wife.
I'm waiting for the fourth.
Hey, new kid.
I'm Michelle.
Johnny.
I just wanna thank you, Johnny.
see, your arrival marks my passing.
I'm no longer the new kid.
Oh, glad to be of help.
Shelly Shell, how are interest rates?
you're funny.
Hey, I got my cell phone paid off.
great. Use it, call me.
he's such a flirt.
Oh!
Bye, Shell.
I like that Shell, she's a quality girl.
Oh, God.
Mm.
that would be Greta.
name doesn't fit though.
she's much more than a Greta.
don't you think?
you know her?
as much as one can know Greta.
she's a bit of an enigma.
my advice, stay away from her.
she can be...
well, enigmatic.
good shot.
you're good.
delete.
nice.
delete.
nice.
delete. Delete. Delete.
that's my camera.
nobody likes a stalker.
I see you've met.
so here I am, in a trailer park in Amarillo, drinking wine out of a box with some redneck named Rufus.
or maybe it was Leroy?
Lord, I was a vain drunk.
angry, lonely.
sad.
not fit for public consumption.
I was too weird for the mainstream and I was too normal for the fringes.
hell, I didn't fit in anywhere.
I did not...belong.
and you know?
all I ever wanted was just...
to belong.
well, that and--and to be Tammy Wynette.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I ain't seen you around here.
what's your name?
uh, Johnny.
how much time you got?
a little over three months.
Oh, you're just a baby.
well, it's nice to meet you, Johnny.
my name is Jesse Jo.
don't let this outfit scare you.
it's bingo night at the Rawhide.
I call the numbers and then I do a little set.
starting over is a bitch, ain't it?
you hang in there, precious.
it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
am I ever gonna see my camera again?
you should ask...
before you take someone's picture.
it's rude.
point taken.
I'm sorry.
Hey, whoa.
okay, before you settle in there, sport, let me just say that last night was a moment. Okay?
moments work really great.
anything beyond that really doesn't.
So...let it go.
so pessimistic.
see? We're not compatible.
you don't even know me.
okay, fine. Let's get to know you.
okay.
believe in God?
Yes, but not in a religious context.
so evolution over the Bible?
without question.
okay, wait.
let's switch gears.
you're channel surfing, and you find Ti
you're channel surfing, and you find Titanic, Leo and Kate.
it's half over.
on the other channel is a Will Ferrell comedy you haven't seen yet.
which do you watch?
Leo and Kate.
Ugh.
I hate romantic saps.
me too.
I wanna watch the ship sink.
are you a virgin?
Yes.
Why?
the first time is inevitable, which makes it predictable which makes it boring.
is that it?
how'd I do?
not bad.
okay, your turn.
no, I pass.
I have no questions.
yours were revealing enough.
how so?
my instant analysis?
you ask a lot of questions.
which suggests:
a--you have very few answers of your own,
B--It gives you the upper hand which provides a false sense of power,
and C--You play games.
evolution over the Bible tells me that you have a high IQ and you prefer logic over the unexplained.
you're a tangible girl, you like things that you can feel and touch, i. e. water sprinklers.
well, don't let me stop you.
the virgin question was simply just thrown in there, once again, as a test
to see how honest I answered all the other questions
you can't tolerate deceit.
and, finally, you are a sap, because only a hopeless romantic would ever even think of referencing the Titanic.
well, see ya.
Oh!
Hey!
Hi.
how was the meeting?
okay.
you know...different.
you're gonna really hurt yourself if you keep doing that.
Yeah, Greta can be dark.
hot, but dark.
she's never liked me much.
she always liked Eddie more.
Johnny...
you're are such a dream for helping out, but that hibiscus is gonna have to go in the shade.
jos can do this, Mom.
and when I learn to say aesthetics in espaol, he will.
most people just rearrange their living rooms.
Johnny, would you please tell your mother
I can't wait to meet her.
coming!
and why are we doing this?
we're floating the front yard.
my mom likes to rotate the plants.
your mom's got way too much time on her hands.
welcome to Palm Springs.
let's get that thing. Yeah.
Yeah, Greta runs hot and cold.
I never liked the way she treated Eddie.
she led him on, screwed with his head.
why did Eddie move?
uh...he didn't move.
his family did.
but, uh, Eddie died.
how'd he die? Oh, it was an accident.
I don't really like talking about it, you know?
it sucks. I mean, uh, I still miss the guy.
toxic gas, don't come in.
well, honey, I-- I need to get to my car.
uh, just a second.
what are you working on?
some new test trials.
how's it going?
um...
not so good.
nobody likes a stalker.
okay, so I'm intrigued.
I know.
lame.
what gives with the camera?
it's important to have a creative outlet.
Oh.
well, I hope you don't mind.
but I got creative with your outlet.
you wanna swim?
you're not wearing a swimsuit.
who needs a swimsuit?
we're not alone.
lame.
you are very bizarre.
Mm.
very bizarre.
it's the heat.
give it a few weeks.
you'll join the club.
Oh, there's definitely something off around here.
this place has a severe tonal problem.
Oh, and you don't?
talk to me.
why are you so sad?
why do you think I'm sad?
Oh, please.
you're textbook.
Oh, my God.
do you just spit this stuff out randomly hoping something will stick?
is that it?
something's haunting you.
it's obvious.
you're trying to hide it, but it's...always there.
peeking out around the edges, making you seem...
sad.
my dad killed himself.
blew his brains out right in front of me.
and you're extremely honest.
which I like...
a lot.
this is a lovely party.
how often does the country club do this?
twice a month.
I head the planning committee, if you'd like to join.
Oh, how sweet.
here's to the lousiest golf swing I've ever seen.
I warned you guys, I'm not much of a golfer.
I know it's a blue hair convention, but you'll get used to it.
Hey, hence the open bar.
what's your poison, big guy?
uh, no, I'm--I'm cool.
right.
Ouch.
come on.
water, sir?
you be careful with that boy.
he is shifty.
excuse me?
it's Jesse Jo.
we met yesterday.
no one recognizes me without my big bar hair.
you work here?
six shifts a week.
cool.
Yeah, "real cool.
I'd prefer to see you at a meeting.
what do you think?
it looks the same. I love it.
I guess the hoof is gone.
you must be my new neighbor.
I'm--I'm Tess. I'm right next door.
your cheekbones are magic.
we're going to be good friends.
okay, new kid, none of this loner stuff.
the party's this way. Come on.
Wow!
you certainly made an effort.
go away, Cliff.
be careful with him.
he's no dummy.
don't worry, I'm not gonna say anything to him.
I can't imagine you would. Intentionally.
but I wouldn't get too close if I were you.
stay away from me, Cliff.
of course.
that was the deal.
screw you.
what are you doing out here all by yourself?
I do best all by myself.
he's a popular guy.
and perfect.
don't forget about perfect.
good to know.
I mean, Cliff is a. a great guy.
just don't worship him, okay?
is that what Eddie did?
what do you know about Eddie?
just that they were friends and...he died.
did he tell you how he died?
he mentioned an accident.
it wasn't?
uh...
it's not important.
uh, you know...
I'm just not that... into tonight.
I'm just gonna head off.
look, I'm sorry if I said something...wrong.
come on.
Ah.
you could've at least told us you were leaving.
we looked everywhere.
sorry.
I was ready to go.
it's not a big deal, is it?
Bob stayed behind.
he's still looking for you.
he'll figure it out.
common courtesy, that's all I ask.
that's funny coming from you.
you gonna blame me forever?
I didn't put a gun to his head, Johnny.
no, Mom.
I don't blame you.
dad had a screw loose.
he was gonna pull that trigger no matter how many men you slept with.
I was wrong to marry so quickly.
I rushed into it, I know.
but it's done.
now, how can I apologize for it?
why did you marry Bob?
I was alone and scared.
and you were drugged out of your mind.
and I didn't know how to help us.
well, you
you didn't have to marry him, Mom.
you didn't have to uproot and move us to the middle of the desert!
it was a good decision.
well, the man you marry should be more than a decision.
I care about him.
I love him.
you paused.
are you sure about that?
Yes, I'm sure.
why else would I marry him?
did you love Dad? Of course I did.
that's you when you're sure, Mom.
Hey.
good, you made it home.
I was just going to bed.
think about it.
think about what?
nothing.
come here, I won't bite.
come here, I won't bite.
little bitch.
I hate you.
I know.
this was the best of all possible worlds.
but even here, a little help was necessary.
and that's where Troy came in.
Troy supplied feel-good pills to all the kids at Hillside.
and, in this way, happiness was spread all around.
life could not possibly be any more wonderful.
Lainie, listen, do you feel like something's missing?
has your energy level been noticeably low lately?
believe me, I know.
Lainie, believe me. Yes.
right. So if you would choose at this time to upgrade to the full platinum package, you would start to see the changes that I'm talking about.
no. No, I don't want you to think of these as vitamins.
son of a bitch. - Charlie!
I am doing VeggiForce.
level three. - Yes!
Oh, absolutely.
Lainie, can I?
can I tell you, it has completely changed my life?
you see?
it has given me an entirely new life system.
good for you, Lainie. Good for you! I'm so happy.
Oh, Dean, hello. It's wonderful to see you.
Troy's out back in his little hideaway.
Dean, do me a favor.
get him to turn his stereo down a bit?
sure. - Great. Thanks so much.
goodbye, Dean.
goodbye, Mrs. Johnson.
Dean, I was hoping to get your opinion on something.
can you come in here for a minute?
it'll just take one second.
publisher sent this over.
it's for promotional events. Book signings, lectures...
...TV.
you got a good eye. What do you think? Is it too much?
what do you want, Dad?
let's have a seat.
I want to talk to you about Troy.
I told you everything already. - You told us the facts.
we're interested in how you feel about it.
dad, who's we? - Your mother and I, of course.
and...
a lot of people. You threw us all for a loop there, pal.
hold on a second. Is this a therapy session?
is that what you're doing? - No, not at all.
you think I'm crazy? - Of course not, Dean.
we're just talking here. Man to man.
just talking? - Absolutely.
man to man?
OK.
Dean, I know Troy was your best friend.
actually, we weren't really friends. We hung out sometimes, that's all.
did you have a better friend than him?
I don't really have any friends, Dad. You know that.
so, strictly speaking, Troy was your best friend.
and how do you feel about the suicide of your best friend in the world?
real shitty.
come on, son, make an effort for me.
dad, I told you before. I'm not all broken up about it.
I know I'm supposed to be. I'm just not.
you're really not?
no, I'm sorry... - No, no. I...
I understand how someone might respond like that.
what are you writing?
dad, I thought we were just talking man to man here.
just one second.
dad, if you write about me again in another one of your stupid books,
I'm gonna kill you.
stupid?
there are several major book chains around this country - That would disagree with you. - All right.
the Happy Accident will pay your college tuition.
all right! - Fine.
let me ask you this.
Mrs. Johnson suspects that Troy might have been selling drugs to some of the kids at school.
yeah? - How do you feel about that?
I feel then it must have been unfulfilling for him.
that's very interesting.
why do you say that?
because he killed himself.
Dean, a young life was taken, and from the moment it happened, you ignored it like it was nothing.
you didn't even tell any of the adults at the party.
can you explain? - I didn't think you would...
what? ...care!
this is called Viloprex.
now, don't fight me on this, I prescribe this to lots of kids.
you want me to take that?
it's just something to give you a little...
...balance.
OK, let me have it.
OK. Wonderful.
carefree LIVING HILLSIDE COMMUNITIES
Lee, can I get some by the end of the day?
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
Lee. My dad's coming to visit this weekend.
I understand, but our supply is a little low right now.
prozac, Haldol, it doesn't matter. Anything to get me through till Monday.
I'm almost out of Ritalin. - Ritalin.
I gotta check. I don't know if we have it.
I still got a few left.
he's here all weekend. - I'll see what I can do, man.
Hey! Psycho!
what happened to your boyfriend?
come on, he's all tied up and waiting for you, Dean.
don't ignore me, Dean.
don't ignore me!
don't ignore me.
here it is, Mrs. Bratley, with all the changes, exactly as you ordered.
I lowered the neckline just a touch.
the crystal beading, a special-order item, but we have to talk about that later.
the buttons, which are covered...
well, it's wonderful.
it's absolutely wonderful.
Oh... yes.
I can see the changes this time.
it's just really... It's amazing.
thank you, Mr. Mayor. We had to put a lot of projects on hold, but that's OK, because I think it's really...
Michael, you didn't even look.
anyway, the fit will be exactly the same.
so, if you like, I can ring it up for you now.
can I see the veil and the dress together?
can I do that? Can I see the two of them together?
I don't know that we can do any more alterations before Sunday.
I just want to see the two of them together.
I don't think I'm being unreasonable.
of course.
you all right?
I mean, after what Billy did this morning?
it's fine. I don't care.
I'm Crystal. - I know.
everyone knows who you are.
you don't like to talk much, do you?
or is it just that you don't like talking to me?
what do you want?
I just want to say I'm sorry, that's all.
Oh, you were a part of that? - No, but they're my friends.
the guys who did it. - Nice friends you have.
well, better to have no friends at all?
honestly? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah.
you know that's why you get so much shit, right?
the way you act like you're smarter than everyone.
well, I don't torment people I don't know.
I thought you said you didn't care. - I'm talking about Troy.
since you can't apologize to him for this morning,
I guess apologizing to me is enough to make yourself feel better, right?
you know what? I was really wrong.
you're definitely not smarter than us.
and why is that?
because Troy was my friend.
how'd you know Troy?
are you apologizing to me now?
no.
you really don't care what people think, do you?
no.
that's a nice trick. - Thanks.
I studied in the far East.
maybe you could show me how it's done.
step one: Years of ridicule.
what if I start by sitting next to you?
it's probably not a good idea.
I'll take my chances.
how do you eat that stuff? - This?
pretty much in the standard way.
you know, if I ate that every day, I'd have a big, fat ass.
is that your greatest fear?
no, but...
...It's my mom's greatest wish.
that you be fat? - No. Just fatter than her, anyway.
sounds healthy.
is it true that you found Troy?
Why? - I'm just...
...wondering what really happened. - Just wondering?
you want me to tell you a bunch of gory details, is that it?
it's impossible trying to talk to you.
you know, I read this statistic that the average kid sees something like...
...10, 000 dead bodies on TV before he turns 18.
is that what it was like?
like TV?
no.
it was nothing like that at all, really.
how'd you know Troy?
listen, Dean, I should have asked you this...
Jesus! Crystal, just suck his dick, why don't you?
Billy. - Did you ask him?
ask me what? - Both of you guys get out of here, OK?
Oh. I don't think she asked him.
ask me what? What are they talking about?
here's the deal, psycho. Troy has something we need, and since you guys were such good butt-buddies, you're gonna go get it for us.
get what? Crystal, what's going on?
pills, dipshit.
pills, go get us the pills and maybe I won't have to kick your ass.
crystal, you were right.
I'm really not as smart as I thought I was.
I really believed you, you know?
wait, Dean... - You were right about something else.
it's not that I don't like talking.
no. It's just that I don't like talking to you.
when I am designing a family room, or an outdoor seating area,
I think, "What is the principle?"
the principle? - The guiding principle.
and I know you don't think in these terms...
it's about balance.
it's all about balance.
right.
Michael. - Yes, Terri?
can you pick up Charlie from school?
I think I'm gonna be here a little while longer.
OK, sure.
believe me, if I told you the story of how we met,
I mean, you saw the scar on his head?
he was almost killed. And I rushed over...
Hey, listen, Lou...
Hey, just because you're the mayor, it doesn't mean you're above the law.
you have to let Terri move on with her life.
you have to move on, yourself.
you might want to pay that ticket right away.
I'd hate to have to hit you with a warrant.
hold on, Lou. Let's talk about this.
two "F's" in Stiffle? - Hurry up.
there's two Stiffles.
what?
there's two Stiffles. Dean and Charlie.
who the hell's Charlie?
perfect vision. It's a gift.
which one of you is Charlie?
you're Charlie? - Yeah.
damn. You're teeny-tiny.
Hey, you wanna come with us? - No way.
look what we got.
what?
goddamn it, Lee. - There he is.
come here.
who the hell's that?
that is Dean's brother.
Hi. - Hi.
shit. My parents.
those kids again, Lee? - We're doing a group project.
with them, Lee? You think they care what grades you get?
mom. - Look, son, you let your grades go now, maybe you don't get into a top-tier school.
Yeah. - You don't get into a top-tier school, maybe you got to settle for a second-rate job.
maybe you don't have the life you want.
maybe each and every day you wake up and wanna crawl back into bed and tell the world to go to hell.
we're just saying, you've worked too hard to blow it in your last year.
we've all worked hard together.
so, come on, champ, hop in the car.
it's for school.
just look at our little man.
all right, Lee.
all right.
sorry about that, Mr. Parker.
can someone please answer the goddamn phone?
Hello?
ask for Dean.
is Dean there, please?
Yes, he is. Who may I say is calling?
it's Billy. - One moment, please.
telephone.
telephone, honey. Some boy named Billy.
all right!
what? - Dean?
what do you want? - We got Charlie.
who? - Your brother.
we kidnapped your brother. - What are you talking about, man?
I got him right now. He's scared shitless.
why did you kidnap my brother?
so you know I'm not fucking around. I want the stuff from Troy.
I all ready told you... - I don't think you're listening.
you are going to get me Troy's drugs.
or what? - Don't push me, psycho.
or what? - I'll kill him. I'm gonna kill him.
I'm not fucking around, man. I swear to God!
I'll cut off his fucking head!
fine. Kill him.
what did he say? - Maybe he really is crazy.
what did he say? - He said for us to kill him.
so, who are you guys calling?
your brother.
who? - Your brother, Dean.
I don't have a brother.
Charlie Stiffle? - Charlie Bratley.
Michael. Honey?
Charlie, Mom's home.
Charlie. Do I see your sheet music not put away?
Charlie, do I need to make dinner?
you're supposed to be the smart one, Lee.
we all messed up. Just forget it already, OK?
it's this one right here.
thanks for the ride. And the burger too.
wait.
I gotta get home... - Will you shut up a minute?
Billy, he has nothing to do with Dean.
maybe that doesn't matter.
honey, please open the door.
OK, I know this whole wedding thing is not easy for you, but it's not like I'm asking you to think of Michael as your father.
Lou will always be your father.
we're up here. - Terri, I'm glad you're home.
I had to leave work.
it's this book. I just can't put it down.
I was really hoping... - Wonderful, honey. A little later?
sweetheart, would you open another bottle for us?
OK.
what does he do? Really?
and is he? He is.
Yeah, well, I guess I could meet him, at least.
honey, I have to go. A bunch of handsome young men just came to visit.
OK. Ciao, baby.
Hello, boys. - Hi, Mrs. Falls.
it's Jerri, please.
who's this? - That's Charlie.
well, hello, Charlie. I don't think we've met.
Hi.
so what sort of trouble are you kids up to tonight?
we kidnapped Charlie to blackmail this guy into giving us a stash of drugs.
very funny.
except, we got the wrong one.
we wanted to get Charlie Stiffle, - but we ended up getting Charlie... - Bratley.
wait a minute, Bratley? Is? Is your mother Terri Bratley, the designer, Terri's Interior Visions?
isn't she getting married to the mayor on Sunday?
he's gonna stay here tonight, OK? - Sure. No problem.
can I get you anything? Some blankets, pillows...
mom, we're fine. - OK.
and what is this?
it's a tuba. - Wow.
maybe we could have a concert later? - Mom.
OK.
you kids have fun. I am gonna put on my bikini.
anybody wants to go for a swim...
but if you leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon as I possibly can.
Hi, Terri. Mrs. Bratley, I'm sorry.
your machine just cut me off.
my name is Jerri Falls, and I live in the Ocean Crest development.
anyway, I...
this is Terri Bratley... - Hi, I'm Jerri Falls...
Hello? - Dean?
Jesus. Can't you guys just leave me alone?
I'd love to, but I can't. - Oh, yeah? Why not?
I need your help. - Yeah, I doubt that.
you know it all, huh? - What do you want?
you know how Billy said he kidnapped your brother?
Yeah, that was a pretty lame bullshitjob, huh?
well, it wasn't all bullshit.
he did take a kid. He just took the wrong one.
wrong what?
the wrong kid.
even though it has nothing to do with you now, he won't let him go.
I don't believe you.
hold on.
Billy, get off of him.
Charlie, come here.
Hello? - Who is this?
this is Charlie Bratley.
did those guys kidnap you? - I think so.
that sucks. - I guess.
where do you live? - 25720 Sunnycrest.
what do you mean? I live on Sunnycrest.
Yeah. I know.
put Crystal back on the phone.
are you guys just fucking with me again, or is this real?
no, I think this is pretty real.
yes? - Hi. Is Charlie here?
he's not really in a talking mood.
but he is here. - I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm Dean. - Isn't it kind of late?
it's for school.
OK. Come right in. See if he'll talk to you, at least.
his room is right there at the top of the stairs.
so, you're a friend of Charlie's? - No, not exactly. No.
Yeah. Charlie doesn't have a lot of friends yet.
he's not really socially gifted.
but he's a good kid, basically.
listen, I just... - Good night. Thanks for coming.
no, no, no. I'm still here.
wait, I've got an idea.
have you eaten yet? Why don't you stay for dinner?
honey, I don't think tonight is the best night.
but I can get that special-ordered, right?
Oh, Michael.
I don't care if you have to fly it in from the moon.
have it here by Sunday. Thank you.
Terri, wait. Wait.
is there anything else?
Yeah. Could you tell Charlie I said goodbye?
OK. - OK.
Hello, Allie.
Carrie, hi. How are you?
am I interrupting? - No, come in.
I'm just in the middle of making dinner.
would you like a glass of wine? - Well, I left the car running.
I just wanted to come back and return your dish and say thank you.
it has been such a relief to not have to cook lately.
everyone has been so nice.
what?
this dish...
Oh! Oh, my God.
this is not the right one?
I got so many, I mean, I've been driving around all night returning them.
like I say, everyone has been so nice.
I don't believe I brought over a casserole.
can you hang on just one second, Carrie?
Allie, am I making a mistake here?
bill and I were meaning to come over, really.
you just get so busy.
no, but I'm certain.
I mean, you came over, we had coffee.
we talked, right?
or am I...
...just imagining the whole thing?
is that what I'm doing here? Am I just...
...imagining all of it?
I'm sorry, Carrie. You just get so busy sometimes.
I'm so embarrassed.
I don't know what I was thinking.
here you are, preparing a nice family dinner...
would you like to stay and eat with us?
and I come in and interrupt everything with no reason at all.
why don't you stay? - I really can't.
I have so many dishes to return.
everyone has been just so unbelievably nice.
so, we'll see you on Sunday? - Sunday?
don't tell me that I forgot your invitation too?
Troy's memorial. It's this Sunday.
of course, Carrie. Right. We're looking forward...
we'll be there.
and...
...I wanted to let you know, just in case you were wondering...
yes?
in no way, whatsoever, do I blame you for Troy's death.
good night.
crystal, come over here. We're gonna have a concert.
I'm fine here, Mom. - Baby, don't be shy.
she's been filling out a little bit lately.
which is completely natural for your age.
I just hope I look as good as you at 35, Mom.
go ahead, Charlie.
yeah?
I mean, you are 35, right?
actually, I'm 39, sweetheart, you know that.
you're 39? - Anytime, Charlie.
I don't have my sheet music.
the only one I know by heart is Tequila.
well, for someone almost 40, you look great, Mom.
well, thank you so much, sweetheart.
40 years old. Wow. - There's no real... I don't know.
the marching band, the melody doesn't go to the tuba.
we know the tune. We'll recognize it. - More wine, Jerri?
I would love some. You are such a charmer.
did you know I'm going to the Air Force after graduation?
did you know that? - No.
they accepted me for the pilot training program.
just like your dad, right?
no. No, he was just a mechanic.
he couldn't even pass the eye test, but me, perfect vision.
it's a gift. - It's wonderful.
just wonderful.
miss Falls? - Jerri, please.
any time. Let's do it.
I live in the city.
in an apartment above the cloud left by the blast.
I'm one of the lucky ones.
one morning,
I woke to find that my head was no longer attached to my body.
I'm not dead, but who could call this a life?
get ready to die.
so I did what I had to do.
in a world of freaks and subhuman creatures...
...I became the Chumscrubber.
Hello? - Crystal?
Yeah, it's me. - Hi...
listen, I just want to ask you something.
when this whole thing is over and we see each other at school, or wherever...
yeah?
I don't really know how to say this...
no, what is it?
well, it's...
can you just...
...leave me alone?
what? - No, I mean it.
leave me alone. - I didn't mean for this all to happen.
don't try to act like you know me.
don't bother me, don't ever talk to me again.
why the hell would I want to talk to someone like you?
exactly.
I'll get you Troy's pills tomorrow.
let's go, Michael. We have a million things to do today.
Terri, could we slow down for a minute?
I was up all night... - Morning!
I really want to talk to you about this book.
certainly a lot of activity around your house lately.
well, I am getting married tomorrow.
I know. That's just so wonderful.
I did want to ask, I don't mean to be rude...
go ahead. - Well...
your people are parking just wherever they like.
and the cleaning crew?
those Mexican folks, they backed right into my yard.
look, you can see. Just right up over the flowers.
not a word of apology.
you mind if we deal about this a little bit later on?
I didn't mean to cause a problem, especially now, while you're preparing for your wonderful wedding.
I have a million things to do today.
I know what you mean, because I'm having the service for my son tomorrow and I have things to prepare, as well.
and I will definitely need my fair share of parking spaces for my guests.
I understand. - I don't mean to be a nuisance.
not at all. - But I did want to tell you, just in case you're wondering, in no way, whatsoever...
point taken!
I can't believe the nerve of that woman.
she knew it was my wedding this Sunday.
can't she find another date for her memorial?
Dean? Honey? Breakfast!
were you watching me?
no.
I must've been slobbering all over myself like a retard, huh?
you look nice.
I bet.
come smoke with me. - OK.
have a seat, it's all ready.
turn off your game now. - Shit, Mom.
what did I tell you about swearing in this house?
you're against it? - Right. I am against it.
I'm not hungry. - Just have some eggs, then.
OK, I've gotta go. - What?
I've got a meeting with the agents. We're talking foreign distribution.
bill, it's Saturday.
I was hoping we could all do something together as a family.
I'm not going anywhere. - Has anyone seen my case?
that's a great attitude. - Welcome.
I just brought it out. I just had it. - Dean, you have to eat something.
I just said I'm not hungry.
it's just a side effect of the medication.
isn't there a more natural way we could treat his problem?
my problem? - A bunch of vitamins isn't gonna help.
they're notjust vitamins.
I could really use an extra set of eyes here.
I could make you some pancakes. - Mom, no, I don't want pancakes.
I'm fine, Mom. I'm fine.
anyway, I have to go. - What? No.
where are you going? - Do I have to explain everything I do?
I'm just meeting some friends. - Really?
don't act too surprised, Mom. - No, why would I be?
cause no one likes him, Mom. - Oh, Charlie.
everyone thinks he's crazy.
I'm asking everyone. Has anyone seen my case?
it's right here on the goddamn, son-of-a-bitch counter!
all right, Mom.
how old are you? - Thirteen.
then why are you so small? - I don't know.
just am.
my dad put me on this Bulk 2000 for awhile, this powder stuff, it ended up costing him $400, but after a couple of weeks,
I got really bad diarrhea.
I ended up losing, like, eight pounds.
my dad went ballistic.
you don't smoke, do you?
sure. Well, no.
here's a secret.
don't act like somebody you're not.
you do that long enough, you'll forget you were acting.
and so will everyone else.
I was actually thinking of going out for marching band.
seems that's what the chicks are into, right?
Yeah, that's right, Billy. Charlie nailed me all night long.
it was unreal.
what the hell did you do that for?
cause I'm a stupid bastard.
let's get the fuck out of this place.
my mom gave this to me on my 12th birthday.
I always hated this stupid thing.
Hello, Debbie? It's Carrie. Johnson.
Oh, I guess it is early.
right. Well, I'm calling because I just wanted to tell you, in case you were wondering, that in no way, whatsoever, do I blame you for Troy's death.
Hello, Timmy? Is your mommy there?
well, can you take a message, sweetie?
all right, write this down.
in no way...
don't ignore me, Dean.
I didn't know we were entertaining.
we're just going to my room for a while.
who's the kid?
Charlie. - Damn, you're teeny-tiny.
I'm holding him for ransom.
Yeah, I should probably get home. My mom's getting married tomorrow.
I was married once.
problem was, if my wife never really...
we're just gonna go inside.
I'm sorry.
come on, let's go.
come here, shitballs. I'm gonna teach you something.
come here.
come here.
listen, if someone tries to kick your ass in high school...
to be honest, you're probably gonna get your ass kicked anyway.
but if you weren't such a pussy, you could try this.
all right. Come at me like you're gonna hit me in the chest.
hit me right here in the chest. Come on, hit me right here.
no, man, like really do it like you got a pair.
really do it. Come on, come on.
that was good. That was good.
he's about half your size. - Are you all right?
are you fucking kidding me?
what are we doing here? We're fucking kidnapping this kid.
am I the only one that fucking remembers that?
you're such a dick, Billy.
what the hell is wrong with you?
Billy, get off of him!
Hey!
who put that knife in the wall?
I did.
you're gonna fix that. - It's my room.
no, this is not your room.
this is a room in my house.
this is my room.
so then you can fix it.
come on. Come on.
I'm getting concerned about Charlie. - Oh, yeah?
Yeah, he just seems so angry lately.
jeez, it's the florist.
Yeah, you're running a little behind?
no kidding. How about a little fired?
how is he with you? Any better? - I haven't seen him much lately.
you must've talked yesterday. - No, we didn't talk at all.
then that is just plain rude. I'm gonna have to have a little talk with him.
see that one? It's not bad, if you're on a budget.
what's rude?
Jesus, this woman keeps calling me.
when you picked Charlie up.
when? - From school.
he wasn't there.
what do you mean? You didn't pick him up?
I figured he walked. I saw you guys talking last night.
come on. This is ridiculous.
Oh, goddamn it.
I see you, Lou!
don't think I don't see what you're doing.
can't you see I don't fucking love you anymore?
let's go. Chop, chop.
look at this.
the First Couple of Hillside right here at my front door.
hello. - Hi, I'm Terri Bratley.
nice to meet you. - This is my fianc? Michael.
of course, I know the mayor. It is an honor, sir, an honor.
I apologize for any inconvenience with Charlie.
it has been such a pleasure getting to know your son.
he is such a nice boy.
and he's so talented and so nice. - Thank you.
I really like him, he's lovely. - Is he all set?
Charlie! - Well, actually...
they just went gallivanting off somewhere.
I'm sure he's fine. They're having so much fun together.
I'm sure. It's just that I have a million things to do today.
my God. This house. - What? What's wrong?
this is where we met. This is where it all started.
this is... This is where... - Oh, you're right, Michael.
you're absolutely right. - What an amazing coincidence.
believe me. If I told you the story of how we met...
you saw the scar on his head? - Yes.
he was almost killed and I rushed over, it was so romantic.
it's the perfect arrangement.
I'll design the next development, he'll fast-track the permits.
it doesn't hurt that he's so good-looking, right?
a woman only gets married once, right? - Yes.
and if that doesn't work out, it's a woman's prerogative to go all out on the next one.
will there be very many single men at your wedding?
well, would you like to come? - I would...
would that be OK? - Of course, I don't see why not.
that would be...
Oh, my God.
Michael, what happened?
nothing, nothing. - Did you fall in the pool?
no, I... Yes, I fell in.
I'm gonna get you a towel.
what's the matter with you?
something big is happening.
what?
I feel like there's another person inside me.
Jesus Christ, get a hold of yourself. This is embarrassing.
you should really take your shirt off. You're gonna catch a cold.
is that good? You're so wet.
we're leaving.
is he? Is he OK?
he's fine. He just hasn't eaten all day.
he's a diabetic. - I'm not a diabetic.
if your energy level is low, I have these wonderful vitamins...
what the hell's wrong with you?
psycho.
Hello? - Crystal?
I got it. Let's just meet at the Promenade and get this over with.
I don't know how we got here, but I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
my dad would probably say there's some great cosmic reason for all this.
and we'll all be better people, right?
well, I don't know.
my dad also says I'm crazy.
Dean, you're not crazy.
there are several major book chains around the country that would probably disagree with you on that point.
I'm my dad's favorite subject and...
I have to go.
Dean. - I'll meet you at the mall.
it's just a beer, Mom.
you don't have to explain yourself to me. I trust you.
I wonder what that would be like.
if we could just switch roles and...
...you could be the parent and I would be the child and you could tell me what to do and I would listen to you and I would trust you.
are you OK?
I'm supposed to be making a casserole now for Troy's memorial service.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
my basic energy level's been noticeably low lately.
mom, I'm sorry.
I have to go. - Nope.
do not explain yourself to me, I told you not to do that.
F-17 Tigershark.
he's here.
took you long enough.
here, this is everything Troy had.
is this the kid?
Yeah, that's him.
all right, let's go. - All right.
fine.
wait a minute. Wait.
what? - What is this shit?
what? It's all there. - VeggiForce?
what are you doing? - Yeah, this whole bag here.
you trying to give me stupid vitamins?
they're not just vitamins. No, no.
this is an entirely new life system.
Billy, leave him alone.
kick his ass. - Shit.
Billy, get off of him.
stop! Stop it. What are you doing to him?
that dude's crazy. - I saw the whole thing.
he started hitting for no reason. - Let go of me!
get off of me!
you stay right here. Honey, honey call the cops.
get off of me! Crystal!
OK, so, now, you want to tell me about this fight at the mall?
no, not really.
Dean, make an effort for me, please.
I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation for this, officer.
I'm all ears.
the guy at the mall was Billy.
he and the other two forced me to steal drugs from Troy.
Troy? Who's this Troy?
Troy Johnson. He's dead. - He committed suicide, sir.
I don't understand.
I told them no, so to force me to do it, they kidnapped my brother.
wait, are you kidding me? You got a son who's kidnapped?
no, wait a second, listen. They got the wrong kid.
they said if I didn't get the stuff from Troy, they were gonna kill him.
you just said Troy was dead. - He is, officer.
Dean... - So I did it, only Charlie...
...my little brother, Charlie, switched the drugs on me.
and I wound up with a bag of my mom's VeggiForce.
VeggiForce? - It's this vitamin line that she hocks.
VeggiForce! I know that stuff.
right, I know, VeggiForce, right. OK.
Yeah. You don't know, do they make a weight gainer for kids?
I could check, I guess. - Anyway, that's why we got in a fight.
cause he wouldn't let the kid go. - Which kid?
the kid who was kidnapped.
OK. I think I understand.
you were fighting with a guy who's kidnapping and drug smuggling with a guy who killed himself.
Yeah. - Well, that's great, Dean, you know?
only there don't happen to be any reports around here of missing kids, so how do you explain that?
I can't. I can't explain that.
officer, can I?
what's his name, this missing kid? What's his name?
Charlie. - Charlie what?
officer Bratley, could you step outside a minute?
I'd like to talk to you in private. - Officer Bratley?
can you make some sense out of this?
I believe I can, yes. - All right.
you stay put. - Yeah.
I kinda wanna go home now.
I'm not having fun anymore.
well, at least let me set you a plate.
listen, I spoke to a colleague of mine at the hospital.
these are a stronger version of what I've already given you, but, listen, they're perfectly safe, OK, pal?
look, Terri, if I could just talk to you here.
Michael, I'm just gonna take a bath, OK?
it's been a long day. - Terri, we have to talk!
Michael, I have done absolutely everything to prepare for our wedding.
everything! All you have to do is show up.
OK? That's it. Show up.
please don't leave me, please don't leave me.
you are gonna listen to me. - No.
it's about the day we met.
there's something I never told you.
have you seen my son, Charlie?
hillside is growing. And this is what it's all about.
this new Ocean Crest development is exactly what...
I am so sorry about this, Mr. Mayor.
I'm Terri.
Bratley, from Terri's Interior Visions and...
...I actually designed all of this.
wonderful.
I feel... I feel so different.
look at this. The footprints...
yeah? - Look, it's like...
Yeah, look at this. - Like dolphins.
dolphins, that's right.
dolphin.
to begin, each of us alike, to actually conjure magic.
this must finally be our goal as free-willed beings.
the joyous acceptance of a pure state of synchronicity, through the seemingly random happy accidents of our lives.
don't you see?
nothing is random.
nothing happens by chance. There is a power at work here.
a power greater than all of us.
don't you see what this means?
I just love you so much.
I was so scared.
tomorrow...
...l'll show you everything.
Yes, I am Dr. Stiffle. Yeah.
you know my book? So you've heard of me?
and my book.
Yes, yes. I see that you are familiar with my work.
to actually conjure magic.
Terri? - Honey.
now, do you see my vision?
Dean, Charlie, breakfast.
it's not coming off. - I thought you understood.
do we have any paint thinner? Go to the garage and look for some.
paint thinner. - Paint thinner?
or maybe some white paint?
we'll just put a coat of white paint over all of it...
and no one'll see it. - You're not making any sense.
why in the world would you do that? - Don't answer it.
don't answer it. - You need to calm down.
Where's the beautiful bride? - Hello. Come in.
how wonderful, the dress.
guys, I really need to talk to you about something.
where are the keys?
it's about that kid, Charlie.
I think we kinda kidnapped him.
here they are.
that's not funny, Lee.
listen to me!
we've had him since Friday.
I don't know what to do.
all right, let's just calm down. I'm sure you didn't have a part of whatever those kids are doing down there.
it just started out as a joke. I didn't think Billy was really gonna do it.
a joke? - Wait a minute.
is this a kidnapping or not?
that sort of thing doesn't happen around here.
if it is, I'm going to have to call the police.
the police? - In our home?
just a minute. I'm talking to Lee.
Lee, is it a joke or not?
no. It's nothing.
no, you don't have to call anybody.
well, I, for one, did not find that very funny at all.
and neither would a top-tier school.
you guys, just go.
everything is totally fine.
our little man.
Yeah, we'll always be here for you.
I don't know why it came to me as a dolphin.
it's just a sign. It could have been anything.
but now I'm aware of a connection that I didn't even know was missing.
maybe we've all been missing it.
Lou, I'm so glad you're here.
we need to talk. - Now is not a good time.
talk to Lou. We need to get some closure here.
closure? Where's Charlie? Where is he?
excuse me, could you help me hold up this end, please?
Hey, I'm getting married today.
I love Michael now, I thought I made that perfectly clear.
where is Charlie? - I don't know...
why don't you know? Is he missing? - No, he's not missing!
where is he? - He is just out gallivanting.
gosh, darn it, honey, you pierced his dorsal.
let's see some fuckin' blood, already.
I probably would've been with some football player, if I hadn't met you.
and I guess I just want to thank you for keeping it interesting for me.
it's definitely not the usual thing.
who wants that, right?
what the fuck are you talking about?
let's just stop, Billy.
let's just quit this thing with Charlie, forget about the pills.
and everything. Let's just stop.
OK?
it's over.
sit down!
guess it doesn't matter what you think.
good. Sit right down, what can I get you?
Charlie, Bill! It's getting cold.
good morning.
do you think that's appropriate for a memorial service?
I think I'll shoot on over to the wedding instead.
what are you talking about?
I covered death extensively in my first two books.
I've done grieving to death.
maybe I'll get a few insights at the wedding.
multiple marriage couples. Gotta be a new book in there.
how is it going to look if we don't go to the memorial?
if it means that much, you go ahead and go.
we should all go together as a family.
I understand your feelings. Maybe you could make the same effort for me.
Dean, it looks like you have a choice to make.
the wedding with him or the memorial with me.
Dean, it's your decision, him or me.
I think it's best if he stayed home today.
he can make up his mind. He's practically an adult.
as a therapist, it's my opinion that he should avoid anything upsetting.
as a mother, it's fucking important he learn how to function in the real world.
I'm not going to get into an argument with you now.
let's not argue. Let's sit down and have a meal together.
Hello? - Hi, is Dean here?
it's for school. - Well, go ahead then.
he's up the stairs at the end of the hall.
could you do me a favor?
would you get him to turn down his stereo down a bit? Thanks so much.
crystal, come on in.
Dean, I need your help.
it's Troy, look, Troy's back. - That's not funny.
crystal, you remember Troy? You guys were friends, right?
she wasn't my friend. Is that what she said?
Oh, Troy says you guys weren't friends.
Dean, there's nobody here.
tell her to fuck off.
I don't think Troy wants to see you right now.
Troy is dead. I mean, he killed himself.
no, no, no. He's back. He's not dead.
Troy, tell her you're not dead. - I am not dead.
you see, Crystal?
but who could call this a life?
here we go.
Troy? - Dean, stop it.
what do you want?
look, this wasn't my fault, OK?
he didn't even tell me, OK?
he was my best friend, and he didn't even tell me he was gonna kill himself.
I could've stopped him.
I wish I could've stopped him.
I'm sorry.
Charlie's gonna get hurt.
nobody else cares.
we become adults. - OK.
and as adults, we formulate a plan.
this is what I need in order to be happy, or this is what I will struggle and sacrifice and bleed for.
but what we really need to do is stop struggling and recognize that there is a greater plan for us all.
is it really that easy? - It's so clear to me, Jerri.
what we've been searching for is right there, staring us in the face. We just have to reach out and grab it.
hello.
Dr. Bill Stiffle?
in my home? Is this really possible?
Yes, yes.
I see that you are familiar with my work.
I just want you to know that none of this would have been possible without you.
Whoa! What the hell's going on here?

I'm gonna kill him? - Yeah.

twin engine P-38 Lightning.
my God! Where the hell have you been?
what happened to you? - I was kidnapped, Dad.
Oh, my God, you're bleeding! Are you OK?
no, he's not OK. He just told me he was kidnapped.
you didn't even know. - Don't try to blame this on me.
Michael. - What kind of father are you?
I'm a good father. - I'm a good mother. That's right.
it's my fault.
I know it is.
I didn't even know him.
I didn't know my own son.
Troy wanted to play guitar in a rock band.
be famous.
but he knew he wasn't any good.
and he felt stupid for wishing that.
he had a crush on this girl since he was 13...
...that he never talked to.
but he probably wished he would've.
he liked you.
but he felt sorry for you and...
...he was afraid that he'd be like his dad.
he was really, really smart.
but he kept all his ideas to himself, unless you asked.
and he took great pictures of people without them even knowing.
I miss him, you know?
he was my friend. He was my best friend.
and I hate myself, that I didn't even know he was about to do this.
thank you.
lee explained how it happened.
he tried to be as helpful as he could.
Yes, ma'am. It was Billy's idea.
he said he'd kill me if I told anyone.
and so Billy learned not to be a bully.
Dr. Stiffle's book tour kept him away.
are there any questions?
anything?
anybody?
Mrs. Stiffle finally found a family that truly appreciated her.
we are a part of the VeggiForce family.
all of us together, working for an entirely new life system!
Terri got the worst of it.
I'm just asking you to have the smallest amount of vision.
her vision was never realized.
please!
the mayor got out of politics for good.
well, in terms of the physical execution, there's only one guiding principle that I rely on, and that's balance.
I mean, it's all about balance.
Hi, baby. - Hi.
and Charlie was sent to live with his father.
breathe! Come on, get tough. Get tough.
get tough. Those people are gonna beat the crap out of you.
punch, smack that guy with both hands, right in the mouth.
come on, push! Yeah. That's it, that's it.
everyone says he's better off now.
Dean and Crystal escaped.
together.
and as for me...
I was dead... but now I live again.
so I will do what I have to, in this world of freaks and sub-human creatures.
and this time, I will not be ignored.
I am...
new patient? -Yes.
I was referred by my lawyer about veneers.
you're a new patient. Fill this out...
...so we know who to contact in case we lose you in the chair.
that was a joke, sweetie. I was being funny.
hello.
Mrs. Remar, I'm Dr. Johnson.
Oh, it's Miss Remar.
and I know who you are. I see another doctor in the building regularly.
I've been on the elevator with you a few times.
Oh, okay.
you're married? I never noticed the ring before.
Oh, yes, I am. I'm married.
all right, what are we doing for you today?
one veneer, is that right?
they told me you don't usually do just one.
we do whatever's needed. Allie.
all right. Let's see.
now, which one is it? -I don't know.
you tell me.
so another cutie with a crush, huh?
what is it with you?
so you'll be back next week?
you're gonna schedule Miss Remar next week for the veneer. Right?
Yeah. I'm gonna clear the schedule the whole week...
...so that you could be mentally prepared for it. Okay?
it was so nice to finally meet you.
Oh, yeah. You too.
okay.
I need the
Oh, it's my daughters.
I'm gonna need that jacket.
okay, you stay, and then I'll reach. -Sorry.
no, that's fine. I'm minutes away.
Charlie--?
Hey, Charlie! Charlie Fineman!
Charlie!
Charlie. Charlie Fineman.
I'm so sick of your father.
he's in that bed again.
just as mean and evil as he can be.
like a pig with a bullet in his head.
you take your walk today, Mom?
I'll take that as a no.
dad?
I hate this city. I hate this damn city.
I don't know why you brought us here.
I got the papaya juice you asked for.
hate this damn city.
and the smell. All that garbage all up and down the street.
daddy? I need money for the dress for the dinner...
...I'm going to with the Jacobsons.
and you'll have to drive me...
...because Mom's gonna be at Cherie's chorus practise.
okay.
we have to talk about getting a cell phone.
this morning, you said we could talk about it tonight.
I thought we talked about the cell-phone issue.
but I'm 13 and I still share with my little sister.
Oh, right. Because you only need a cell phone if Mommy or Daddy's late-- -I ran into Charlie Fineman today.
Really? How is he?
I don't know. I was in the car and he was on foot.
he was coming out of a hardware store. He was carrying paint.
you think he's still practising?
who's Charlie Fineman, Daddy?
he's an old college friend of mine, baby.
he was my college roommate, actually.
I haven't talked to him in a long, long time.
is he the one from dental school...
...whose family was on the plane? Is that Charlie Fineman?
Yeah.
that's Charlie Fineman.
you know, I decided to sign us up for another photography class.
you did? You already signed us up?
Yeah, but this time for the advanced one.
I thought we had fun last quarter, didn't you?
what, you don't want to?
no, I do. Don't you?
I loved it.
I had a really good time. -Yeah.
didn't you love it? -I did.
and now Advanced Photography? I mean, wow. I'm-- Yeah.
good.
no sugar.
don't take that to school, okay?
whole Foods. Whole Foods snacks.
Hey, Angela. -Dr. Johnson.
what is it about us always leaving the building at the same time?
it's quitting time. -That's true.
you good? -Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.
good. Let me ask you something. Most married men have hobbies.
okay, Alan. Don't do this. Come on.
don't do what? -We talked about this.
it's not really fair for you to wait for me out here on the street.
if you wanna make an appointment, we can make an appointment.
Yeah, I know. But it's a little thing.
now, you remember the friend I was asking you about?
the friend who has no friends? Other than you?
Yeah, him. So he's a married guy, right?
and he's got a great wife and the whole nine.
but she will not let him-- I mean, it's like he can't just
I mean, guys have guy hobbies, right?
they play poker, they golf, they do shit.
okay, you know what? Stop. Stop.
I can't treat you from the lobby to the car park.
treat me? I'm not-- I just asked you a question.
well, whatever you wanna call it-- -No, you're right.
it's inappropriate. -You're right. I get it.
let me ask you one thing.
I want your opinion as a woman, Angela.
as a woman.
look, if I have this recurring dream where...
...I'm sitting on my couch...
...and it turns into a big vat of rubber, what is that?
why don't you let me refer you to someone else?
okay. Well...
...I hope it works out for you.
you wait for me enough times out on the street, though...
...you might owe me some dental work.
have a nice day.
bingo. There we go.
that was a tough one. -Okay. Absolutely.
now it all will fall into place.
dad, can you take me to Becky Fishman's?
sweetie, it's 9: 30.
she wants me to spend the night.
well, Daddy's had a long day at work...
...and he's finally finding some time to enjoy himself.
just have her come over here.
and we can study your French together.
Oh, you know what? I'll take her. I'll go.
babe. We've come this far. We've been working on this all week.
I know. I'll go. I'll go, and then I'll just come right back.
don't be mad if I have this all done by the time you get back.
because I'm on a roll here.
you're gonna miss out on all the action.
just make sure you save me some sky, okay?
you know you owe that child bigtime.
you would've thought she got you out of traffic school by the look on your face.
good night, babe.
good night. -Thanks.
Hey, Charlie. Charlie. Charlie Fineman, hey!
Charlie, stop!
Hey, Charlie. Hey, man. -Yeah?
it's Alan. -Hey. How are you?
I saw you coming out of a paint store a couple weeks ago and...
I was screaming for you, honking the horn.
I stopped the car, jumped out in traffic. It was crazy.
then I tried to get in touch with you, but nobody had any info on you.
Oh, good, good. Very cool.
how you doing? -So we know each other?
are you kidding me?
it's Alan Johnson, Charlie.
we went to dental school together.
Burrows Hall. I was your college roommate. You don't remember me?
Yeah, very cool. Very cool.
good. Good to see you, Burrows. -It's Johnson.
Charlie, you seriously don't remember me?
we were college roommates? -Yeah.
Yeah, you slept naked most nights.
and you were a sleepwalker. It was the worst two years of my life.
Hey, are you practising, man?
I tried to get in touch through the Dental Guild
I'm practising all the time, up in the valley.
took down 1 2 of the Colossus so far.
the valley? What is that? Is that a medical complex or something?
it's more like another dimension.
you take a journey and discover yourself.
Hey, man, you wanna go get a drink? -I can't drink. I can't drink.
I can't drink. I can't drink.
I gotta get going.
then a coffee or something. Let's just go get a cup of coffee.
real quick. I would just love to catch up with you, man.
Hey, Charlie.
this okay?
you like trivia?
name the Great Lakes.
the Great Lakes. Can you name them?
okay, Michigan is one.
Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior.
that was an easy one.
that's fifth-grade shit.
so, what have you been up to lately, Charlie?
I'm stuck between Pale White and Moon White.
I tried Butterscotch Yellow.
I couldn't live with it.
you painting something? You're remodeling or...?
you were my college roommate.
that was a long time ago.
a whole other life. -Oh, yeah. No shit.
it's good to see your face.
Johnson.
Yeah, it's good to see you too, Charlie.
Yeah. All right.
you gotta take those shoes off.
thank you.
great record collection.
Yeah.
I'm happy with it.
a lot of vinyl. -Yeah. Over 5500 so far.
it's a work in progress.
kitchen remodel?
what is this?
shadows of the Colossus.
can I use your bathroom, Charlie?
Oh, in the back.
nice music room.
good?
okay.
there you go, Allie. Thank you.
I'm sorry about the way I behaved the last time I was here, doctor.
but when I see you in the building, you always seem very busy.
preoccupied.
even when you're with the other doctors, you seem so solitary.
so alone.
I don't know why, but that seems very familiar to me.
Yeah.
well.
I hope you're
I just thought that if you wanted me to...
...I would.
with my mouth.
I would.
you could lock that door...
...tell the nurse not to come in.
I'd do it.
I'd enjoy making you happy.
you have to leave.
I have this odd sense of intimacy towards you. I don't even know why.
I told my shrink, and she said I should act on it.
Oh, she did? You need to get a new shrink.
get several. And get a new dentist too.
you gotta get out of here, Miss Remar.
I'm serious. I need you to leave right now. Please. Go.
okay.
come on.
okay.
the fuck--?
I need you not to reschedule Miss Remar for anything.
okay.
ever again. Nothing.
okay.
I don't want this woman as a patient.
got it. I got it. -Fine. Thank you.
excuse me!
not right now. Hey. Melanie, call her.
miss Remar? -On the phone, I mean. Don't
miss Remar, you need to find another dentist.
excuse me? -You heard me.
Dr. Johnson don't want you as a patient...
...neither do any other doctors here...
...so go somewhere, bury your face in the phone book...
...and find another dentist, all right?
bury your face in the phone book"? -Yes.
you have to be bold to make these kind of people go away.
thanks for holding.
can I help you?
I'm just going up to see a friend of mine, Charlie Fineman.
nobody by that name lives here. Sorry.
that's fine. I'll just wait for the landlord.
that's me.
landlady. Adell Modell, landlady from hell.
Oh, well, I'm Alan Johnson. I'm a friend of Charlie's.
sure. -We went to dental school together
I was in his apartment the other night. We were playing...
..."Shadows of the Colossus" or something.
you were up there in his apartment the other night? That's a load of crap.
he hasn't had anybody up there in four years.
just me, Sugarman the accountant, the cleaning girl.
he doesn't know about the cleaning girl.
I'm not lying to you. I was up there. -Yeah.
he's remodeling his kitchen. Now, how would I know that?
he's been remodeling that kitchen once every couple of months.
that tells me nothing. Go away.
Johnson. Johnson!
Alan!
alan Johnson.
this is my college roommate.
it's my college roommate.
I used to sleep in the nude.
check this out.
I got a... You'll appreciate this.
the Pretenders, It's one of the great debut albums of all time.
Yeah, that's you. Terrible taste in music.
no, no, not true. Not true.
smell these things.
I love the way they smell. Take a whiff.
brings back a feeling. Smells like the late '70s, don't it?
the early '80s. Yeah. -Charlie!
Charlie!
it's okay, Charlie. I'll take care of them.
who's that? -Charlie, we just wanna talk.
we gotta go. We gotta go. -What?
Why? Who is that?
Johnson, hop on. Hop on, Johnson.
hop on? -Get on. Get on. Johnson.
who is that? -Johnson, damn it, get on.
just get on the back. -Wait a minute!
Charlie! Charlie! Bus, Charlie!
Oh, shit! Charlie.
I know, I know. All right.
you're late. They're pissed.
name the one national U. S. monument that's movable.
suck my ass, retard. You're late. Get in there.
no. San Francisco cable cars.
good. I didn't know that one either. That's a good one.
that's a great one if you ever wanna stump somebody.
if you guys could not laugh at anything I say, that'd really...
I'm trying to get my self-esteem to go to, like, seven percent.
could I get another Heineken?
you want another root beer? -I got enough. Thanks.
Thanks.
Hey, it was fun watching you up there tonight, man.
it was good music.
I don't know if I'd go that far.
but you know what it reminded me of? It reminded me of school.
when you used to jam to that Bruce Springsteen album.
what was the name of that album? -Bruce Springsteen...
Yeah. What was that? The River, -The River? -The River, You remember that?
I was always trying to get you to play The O'Jays or Earth, Wind & Fire...
...but you always wanted to jam to The River,
I don't remember jamming to it.
maybe if you smelled it, it'd all come rushing back.
this was fun, man. -Oh, yeah.
I had a good day today.
riding around on that silly scooter. It was
it was my first time doubles.
it was fun. It was fun. -Yeah.
I don't do anything like that.
lot of girls here, Charlie.
that's gotta be half of the appeal, right?
why'd you ask me that?
I don't know.
I don't know. I'm just making small talk, you know?
you're single now. You can do whatever you
what? -After what happened...
...with your family and everything-- -Whoa, hey, I don't have a family.
no. No, I know. I was just trying to make small talk, but that was stupid.
who sent you here?
did they send you here? -What are you talking about?
are you a specialist? -A sp--? No, I'm not
what are you talking about? -Don't lie to me!
don't lie to me. Don't lie to me.
Charlie, calm down. -Why are you here?
Why? Why?
answer my fucking question. -Charlie, you're screaming.
why are you here right now talking to me?
relax. Okay? -Why? Why?
shit!
the fuck is wrong with you? -Why are you talking to me?
Oh, now I'm boring you? Mr. Heckler?
I'm bored too. I'm sorry if I'm boring you. I'm sorry.
you tell them to leave me alone!
Alan.
when you get a minute, we need to see you.
Alan, this is bad. The woman sent us a letter, threatened to file a lawsuit.
she claims that you sexually assaulted her in the office on several occasions.
that is ridiculous, all right? That's absurd.
well, we checked with Melanie.
Donna Remar. What do you know about her?
this woman is insane. Okay?
she came in, I put a single veneer on her...
...she tells me she's got this obsession
excuse me, Marie.
she said she wants to give me oral sex in the office.
you know what, you need to make this go away.
we can't handle a hit like this on our insurance.
even if we win, we're gonna get killed.
how do I do that? How do I make this go away?
I don't know how you make it go away. You see her again, you discuss it...
damn. I mean, isn't this exactly like what it was the last time?
woman falls for you, you lead them along
you know what, John? -No. No.
what, Johnson?
I'll get into it.
Dr. Johnson? I need to speak with you.
I'm Ginger Timpleman...
...and I'm Charlie Fineman's mother-in-law.
did you know Charlie's family? -No.
his parents died when he was in grade school.
he lived with an aunt before college. I met her a couple of times.
she passed just before the wedding.
you know, my wife and I, we tried to call him so many times.
hadn't seen him in years, and I read about what happened in the paper...
...and I was just-- I was just heartbroken for him, you know?
for them.
he just, you know, shut down.
quit work. He stopped wanting to talk about her.
then he acted like he didn't remember them.
then he pretended he didn't remember us.
Yeah.
all my husband and I wanna do is see him.
and that crazy landlady and his business manager, Sugarman...
...both conspire to keep us away.
Sugarman? -Yeah, I don't care for him.
who knows what that little shyster's taking from Charlie.
what is there to take? -Between the government payout...
...the insurance policy, Charlie has enough to take care of himself...
my husband retired young. He was a cop.
you know, we were young. Young to be grandparents.
I was gonna do nothing but travel...
...and spoil my granddaughters.
then those monsters flew over here from across the world...
...and rearranged my dance card.
sorry. -Of course you are.
but he needs help.
not the kind that landlady and some little accountant can give him.
he needs a therapist.
and he needs family.
guess what. Jonathan and I are the only family Charlie's got.
Hey. Hey. Somebody's at the door. Somebody's at the door.
Cherie. Cherie.
get away from the door. -What are you doing?
you don't go to the door in the middle of the night. You know that.
I think it's Charlie Fineman.
is that Charlie?
Oh, yeah, that's him. -Okay.
so let him in.
were you in bed already? What's going on? It's 10: 30.
I'm always in bed at 1 0: 30.
that sucks. That's grim. -You don't have any root beer on you...
...do you? -No, why?
Alan.
Charlie, this is my wife, Janeane.
Hi, I believe we met about 15 years ago in Central Park.
I don't expect you to remember it. -I don't.
okay.
this is our daughter Cherie.
nice to meet you, Dr. Fineman.
go to bed, sweetheart.
what's going on, Charlie?
you wanna go out, man? Go have some fun? Let's hang out.
right now? -Yeah, wake up. Come on. Let's
can he go out? Is he allowed out? -Charlie, don't do that.
don't ask my wife permission for me to go out.
I'm right here in front of you. I'm not 7 years old.
you're right. Can you go out?
she's threatening to sue you? What does she want?
she wants to go down on me.
well, you tell her you can't do that. -No, I know.
you tell her you're married? -She knows.
it's not a deterrent for this one.
I mean, she's got some kind of a fixation or something.
Oh, well, fix it for her.
it's not funny, Charlie.
no, no, no. -It's really not funny, I mean...
my partners are up my ass. -Right.
we already pay an obscene amount in liability insurance.
you should tell your partners they can do to you what the girl wants to do.
fuck them.
I don't know.
it's a five-year lease, 50 grand a month...
...my name on it. My partners get pissed off...
...and they leave me holding the bag, that's it, I'm done.
Yeah. -I put the whole thing together.
they act like I'm the one who works for them.
but the girl, what are you gonna do about that?
that's weird, you know? It's kind of heavy.
Yeah, it is. I'm telling you, this girl's seriously troubled.
Oh, yeah. She got a lot of problems if she wants to blow you.
she's out of her mind. I've seen that thing.
that's very funny. -No, no, no.
no, it is-- Are you having fun?
to tell you the truth, I kind of am, Johnson.
it's nice to see you in the soup like this.
it's funny. Just not used to it.
here. Take it easy. Take it easy. -Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
any chance of you getting audited this week?
because that would make things even better.
or maybe we could go somewhere...
...and you could burn your tongue on some pizza. I'd like that too.
I would love that.
I need you to hold for one moment.
you are not gonna believe who this is on the phone.
who? -The nut.
at this point in my life, you're gonna have to be very specific.
Donna Remar.
she wants to come in for another consultation for some more veneers.
can you believe that? Ma'am?
ma'am? -Schedule it.
excuse me? -Schedule it in my office alone.
morning, Oscar. -Hey, doc.
good to see you.
Hello, Dr. Johnson. -Hello.
I've got a question. -I'm sure you do.
no, it's not about me this time. -How refreshing.
it's about a friend. Really, though. I mean, really, a real friend.
he lost his whole family in a plane crash.
right. -It's horrible.
I mean, his wife, his three daughters.
this guy used to be a dentist.
how long ago? -It's a few years ago...
...and he's lost now. You know? He's completely lost.
I bumped into him. We used to be college roommates for two years.
he didn't even remember me. -Well, offhand, that sounds like...
...post-traumatic stress disorder. Maybe worse.
I couldn't really know without seeing him. It sounds like he needs help.
is he getting help? -I don't know.
I mean, the whole thing is...
it's really odd, you know? It's crazy odd.
how are you?
I'm fine. I got nothing to complain about.
does that mean you're fine?
very good. You are gonna be sending me a bill one day.
you might wanna check your mailbox.
okay. -Dr. Johnson, I think it would be...
...really good for you to talk to someone.
I just sense that it would be...
...Good for you to be a little bit more communicative.
I hope that didn't offend you.
okay. Well, I'll see you soon?
okay.
Charlie. -In the back!
hope the shoes are off. -Shoes are off. Shoes are off.
Hey, the kitchen's looking good, man. You almost done?
is that The River?
Yeah.
you know, I gotta get you enrolled in a music-appreciation class.
Oh, right, yeah. Tell that to Clarence Clemons.
what's going on? What's going on with the girl?
the crazy girl, the one who wants your penis. How's she doing?
let's not talk about her. -Yeah, you wanna--? Lose that tie.
lose the tie and the scarf. The whole outfit.
for what? -Come on, take it off.
psychedelic time. Psychedelic time.
I smell a Fineman jam session coming on.
Yeah, Burrows Hall-style. Burrows Hall.
jamming and jamming and jamming.
here. -I don't play guitar, Charlie.
Hey, Johnson, you're barely a dentist.
you pull people's teeth all day. It don't matter.
come on. Come on. All right. Get that in you. Get that in you.
let me do this. -You'll get to this. Come on.
let me hear some of that.
I don't know how to play this,
Charlie Fineman!
alan Johnson. Alan Johnson! -Charlie Fineman!
good night, Jersey!
Philadelphia. Philadelphia! -Good night, Philly!
baby, I'm sorry. I messed up, but you know I don't ever do anything like that.
I just didn't wanna call you and wake you up.
I was stuck in Charlie world. I couldn't...
...leave.
this is not okay.
you staying out all night...
...It's not acceptable.
I'm just saying, the guy's in a lot of pain.
it's sad over there, baby. It's just
just a sea of sadness.
Yeah. -Hi. Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson.
you don't have an appointment, sir? -Oh, we're friends.
what--? -We were college roommates.
And? -I used to sleep in the nude.
Charlie? -All right, come in.
I hear " Colossus."
Hey.
Hey, hey, buddy. Take the shoes off. I told you.
I told you.
Hey, didn't you just...?
all right. All right.
Hey, let me try it.
hang on.
let me try it. -Just watch me do it first.
let me just try it.
okay, how do you shoot it? -Square is to stab him.
that's the bird. You wanna shoot him, get his attention.
all right. All right, get your arrow ready.
and let me pluck him right in the uterus.
aim what?
Oh, fuck.
I could show you how to do it, give you some hints...
...but I'll warn you, it's very addictive.
well, I don't have an addictive personality...
...so just show me how to do it.
is something I said funny?
all right.
that'll call your horse. The triangle is how you jump...
okay, okay, very good.
stab his arm. -I'm stabbing him in the arm.
no, you gotta stab in the right spot. -I'm stabbing it right there.
you gotta be on the light.
shit. -That's not gonna work.
I gotta climb this big son of a bitch
look, just put it down, all right? Rest.
next time you come, you'll be better. Let it soak in.
no, no, no. Right now. No next. Now.
I thought you don't have an addictive personality.
that was the line of the night, man.
you're an addict.
say it, man. Say you're an addict. -Yeah, okay. I'm an addict. All right.
come on, now, stab his wing. -Oh, God.
Oh, I'm on your ass, bird. -Stab his wing. All right. Yeah.
colossus!
that's the first three...
okay, now, wait. You said they get bigger too?
well, no, it's different.
it's like you're gonna use a bow and arrow more.
each one will have different powers. -What are we doing?
wait a minute, Charlie, you said get a burger, man. I can't
I can't do this. I gotta work in the morning.
Yeah, so you'll work, you'll be tired. So what?
this is like a marathon, man. It'll go till 5 in the morning. I can't
you'll go to sleep tomorrow night at 8: 00 instead of 10: 30.
how's that? Is that enough sleep, you faggot?
Hey, don't call me faggot.
are you a faggot? -Quit saying faggot.
just don't say faggot.
don't just call people faggot. That's rude.
to a gay guy it is. To you, it's just...
...a funny word, like pound cake or pickle.
you're a fucked-up dude, man.
I'm a fucked-up dude? Okay.
you really need some Mel.
you need some Mel.
I'll take one adult and one faggot.
come on, you really need to come in here.
Johnson.
Johnson. -Okay.
good decision.
Hey! The sheriff is a nig
what did he say? -The sheriff is near,
no,
the sheriff is a nig
I ain't got no body
and nobody cares for me
he's out of his mind.
richard Pryor, he did his own thing. -They both did great, obviously...
...but I can only imagine, if they would have done another one?
Janeane's called 1 5 times.
Hello? -Hey, baby.
where have you been? I've been calling you for the last three hours.
I know. I'm sorry. I had the phone off. I was in this Mel Brooks marathon.
I've never laughed so hard. I gotta bring you down here.
this thing is crazy. -Alan, I need you to listen to me.
your father's died.
what? -And I've been trying to reach you
what did you just say? -Your mother called here, a couple hours after you left,
he died in his sleep, in his bed...
...and Mom's here with us now and she's very upset and she needs you.
wait a minute, wait a minute. He's dead?
I'm sorry, baby.
where are the girls? -They're with Mom on the couch.
they're fine.
I'll be home as soon as I can. -Will you please hurry up?
Yeah, I will.
everything cool?
my dad just died.
died, like...
...dead? -Yeah.
you wanna go get some breakfast?
Charlie, my father just died.
Yeah. There's a store that's gonna open up soon.
sells kitchen counters. I wanna take you there.
they got marble tops. -Charlie, my father just died.
Yeah, yeah, I know. I wanna hang, though.
come on. Let's not waste all this Mel.
we just got a good dose of Mel.
are we hanging?
no.
we're not hanging.
Oh, hey, let's get some Chinese. Come on, don't be such a pussy.
all right, does everybody see what it is?
here it is. At the bottom. See? Good look.
come on. What do you think?
Yeah. -Johnson?
Yep. -I'm Sugarman.
Bryan Sugarman? Did I catch you at a bad time?
well, I just came back from burying my father, but other than that
cool. Let me just say up front, Alan...
...I make it my business to watch this guy's back.
that's what I do. I look out for him. -Okay.
now, obviously, I can't stop him from doing this without going down a very dangerous legal road.
but rest assured, I'll do anything short of that...
...to not give you a million dollars.
I don't know what you're talking about.
he wants me to give you a million dollars.
he has that kind of money?
that's none of your business. That's my business. It's what I do.
we've already established that. I won't let him be manipulated.
Sugarman, calm down, okay?
I don't want his million dollars.
tell him I'm not mad at him and we're still friends, okay? Just tell him that.
you're being straight? -Yes.
I don't need his million dollars, okay? Just tell him that.
okay. I like that.
okay, good, then I've done my job.
Yeah. Good job.
come on in and have some food.
go ahead.
daddy, your friend is here.
the one who acts like he's younger than JoJo.
Charlie Fineman?
honey, don't be like that, okay?
don't judge people. That's not polite.
Hey.
I'm sorry about your dad.
Thanks.
I behaved badly that night. I know I did.
all right? I'm sorry.
and you wanted to give me a million dollars to make up for it?
I don't have any friends other than you, Johnson.
I got you something.
the River, -Absolutely.
and Quadrophenia, -Yeah.
another album you used to torture me with.
Quadrophenia changed my life, Johnson.
that's a nice gift.
too late to go for the million?
Hey, are you hungry? -Yeah.
wanna get some breakfast? -Yeah.
come on. -All right.
just me and you here?
Hey, everybody...
...this is Charlie. Charlie...
...this is everybody. Come on in.
these guys are staying?
Yeah, Charlie. Everybody's staying.
Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson. We're having lunch today.
we're having Chinese.
I can't tell you how happy that makes me.
the last time you were in a dental office, anyway?
need to schedule you for a cleaning?
come on. Let's go get something to eat.
you miss it?
miss what?
nothing. Forget it. -What? What? Come on.
Charlie, nothing, all right? Forget it.
no, what do you think I missed, being a dentist?
do you?
Why?
why what? -Why are you asking me?
are you trying to focus me?
is that it? Did they send you here to focus me?
Yeah, you got me. That's it. I'm with the CIA...
...and this is Operation Focus Fineman.
are you kidding me? -Better not be.
Charlie, if we're gonna be friends, you have to be able to trust me.
thought we were friends. -We are friends.
that's why I can't pretend I don't know anything about you.
is that a threat, though, to not be friends?
no. I'm saying friends talk about what's going on in their lives.
you're an asshole.
Charlie-- Hey, Charlie!
what the fuck is wrong with you?
get out of here, man!
Charlie, get the f
okay, okay. Get out of here. Get out of here.
leave me alone! All right?
Charlie, get out of here!
Yeah. All right.
shut your mouth.
what are you still doing in here? I told you to leave.
because this isn't your office. I left! This is public property.
this isn't close to public property. -Yes, it is!
get out of here, man! -I'll call the police if you don't leave.
it's okay. Let me handle it. -No, it's not! He's
Melanie, shut the damn window!
Jesus.
we can't keep doing this shit, Charlie.
look, I don't know what I said to you in there that got you so pissed off...
...but I'm sorry, Charlie, all right?
all right.
Jesus. -I know.
Dr. Johnson. -Miss Remar.
is everything okay? -Oh, yeah. Everything's good.
I have an appointment scheduled. -Just check in with Melanie.
maybe I should come back. -No, no, it's fine. Just check in.
check in with Melanie.
the one who--?
doctor will see you in the office.
that gorgeous girl wants to blow you?
Charlie, come on. -She wants to blow you?
look, get out-- -Come here.
are you crazy? Get out of here.
she's gorgeous. -Yeah, I know.
way you were talking about-- Thought she was a beast or something.
I gotta straighten this out. -All right, but how hot is that girl?
she's fine. She's hot. -She's the hottest.
is she not the hottest? -Charlie, will you get out--?
let me go in for you. Let me get the blowjob.
let me see that woman. -Oh, you're playful now? Get out.
stop it! Get out of here!
did you smell that? She even smells good!
Jesus.
I wanna know what is going on. -Nothing is going on.
don't tell me nothing's going on. -Calm down.
let me explain it, okay? -All right, explain it.
she's like out of a 1940s movie.
did you see that girl?
I mean, that was just perfection.
you okay?
"okay"?
no, I wouldn't use that word.
well, thank you for seeing me.
did I have a choice, Miss Remar? I mean...
you've really put me in a terrible position here at my office.
can we just cut to it? I don't wanna take a lot of your time.
Yeah.
this letter...
...that you sent my
I can do this quick.
wait a-- No, no.
please.
recently, I've come through a rotten divorce.
I was married for 10 years.
my husband was having an affair for five of them.
they had another life here in the city.
he had two lives.
I was walking down the street one day and I saw them.
and I followed them, and it was truly like a dream.
I spoke to a neighbour and she talked about them...
...as if they were the Joneses living next door all these years.
and in that moment, I lost my equilibrium.
and I fell, right there on the sidewalk.
and the thing is, Dr. Johnson, I haven't yet gotten up.
now, my behaviour towards you is inexcusable, I know that.
I behaved in a way I don't normally behave.
what I've done by even threatening a lawsuit is so repulsive to me.
I even lied to you when I told you that my therapist had told me to act on my thoughts.
I wanted to come in and see you and tell you that I am so sorry.
and that I am very embarrassed.
and that you won't be having any more trouble from me.
I promise that to you. -Okay.
okay.
new patient? -Yes.
I was referred by my lawyer about veneers.
you're a new patient. Fill this out...
...so we know who to contact in case we lose you in the chair.
that was a joke, sweetie. I was being funny.
hello.
Mrs. Remar, I'm Dr. Johnson.
Oh, it's Miss Remar.
and I know who you are. I see another doctor in the building regularly.
I've been on the elevator with you a few times.
Oh, okay.
you're married? I never noticed the ring before.
Oh, yes, I am. I'm married.
all right, what are we doing for you today?
one veneer, is that right?
they told me you don't usually do just one.
we do whatever's needed. Allie.
all right. Let's see.
now, which one is it? -I don't know.
you tell me.
so another cutie with a crush, huh?
what is it with you?
so you'll be back next week?
you're gonna schedule Miss Remar next week for the veneer. Right?
Yeah. I'm gonna clear the schedule the whole week...
...so that you could be mentally prepared for it. Okay?
it was so nice to finally meet you.
Oh, yeah. You too.
okay.
I need the
Oh, it's my daughters.
I'm gonna need that jacket.
okay, you stay, and then I'll reach. -Sorry.
no, that's fine. I'm minutes away.
Charlie--?
Hey, Charlie! Charlie Fineman!
Charlie!
Charlie. Charlie Fineman.
I'm so sick of your father.
he's in that bed again.
just as mean and evil as he can be.
like a pig with a bullet in his head.
you take your walk today, Mom?
I'll take that as a no.
dad?
I hate this city. I hate this damn city.
I don't know why you brought us here.
I got the papaya juice you asked for.
hate this damn city.
and the smell. All that garbage all up and down the street.
daddy? I need money for the dress for the dinner...
...I'm going to with the Jacobsons.
and you'll have to drive me...
...because Mom's gonna be at Cherie's chorus practise.
okay.
we have to talk about getting a cell phone.
this morning, you said we could talk about it tonight.
I thought we talked about the cell-phone issue.
but I'm 13 and I still share with my little sister.
Oh, right. Because you only need a cell phone if Mommy or Daddy's late-- -I ran into Charlie Fineman today.
Really? How is he?
I don't know. I was in the car and he was on foot.
he was coming out of a hardware store. He was carrying paint.
you think he's still practising?
who's Charlie Fineman, Daddy?
he's an old college friend of mine, baby.
he was my college roommate, actually.
I haven't talked to him in a long, long time.
is he the one from dental school...
...whose family was on the plane? Is that Charlie Fineman?
Yeah.
that's Charlie Fineman.
you know, I decided to sign us up for another photography class.
you did? You already signed us up?
Yeah, but this time for the advanced one.
I thought we had fun last quarter, didn't you?
what, you don't want to?
no, I do. Don't you?
I loved it.
I had a really good time. -Yeah.
didn't you love it? -I did.
and now Advanced Photography? I mean, wow. I'm-- Yeah.
good.
no sugar.
don't take that to school, okay?
whole Foods. Whole Foods snacks.
Hey, Angela. -Dr. Johnson.
what is it about us always leaving the building at the same time?
it's quitting time. -That's true.
you good? -Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.
good. Let me ask you something. Most married men have hobbies.
okay, Alan. Don't do this. Come on.
don't do what? -We talked about this.
it's not really fair for you to wait for me out here on the street.
if you wanna make an appointment, we can make an appointment.
Yeah, I know. But it's a little thing.
now, you remember the friend I was asking you about?
the friend who has no friends? Other than you?
Yeah, him. So he's a married guy, right?
and he's got a great wife and the whole nine.
but she will not let him-- I mean, it's like he can't just
I mean, guys have guy hobbies, right?
they play poker, they golf, they do shit.
okay, you know what? Stop. Stop.
I can't treat you from the lobby to the car park.
treat me? I'm not-- I just asked you a question.
well, whatever you wanna call it-- -No, you're right.
it's inappropriate. -You're right. I get it.
let me ask you one thing.
I want your opinion as a woman, Angela.
as a woman.
look, if I have this recurring dream where...
...I'm sitting on my couch...
...and it turns into a big vat of rubber, what is that?
why don't you let me refer you to someone else?
okay. Well...
...I hope it works out for you.
you wait for me enough times out on the street, though...
...you might owe me some dental work.
have a nice day.
bingo. There we go.
that was a tough one. -Okay. Absolutely.
now it all will fall into place.
dad, can you take me to Becky Fishman's?
sweetie, it's 9: 30.
she wants me to spend the night.
well, Daddy's had a long day at work...
...and he's finally finding some time to enjoy himself.
just have her come over here.
and we can study your French together.
Oh, you know what? I'll take her. I'll go.
babe. We've come this far. We've been working on this all week.
I know. I'll go. I'll go, and then I'll just come right back.
don't be mad if I have this all done by the time you get back.
because I'm on a roll here.
you're gonna miss out on all the action.
just make sure you save me some sky, okay?
you know you owe that child bigtime.
you would've thought she got you out of traffic school by the look on your face.
good night, babe.
good night. -Thanks.
Hey, Charlie. Charlie. Charlie Fineman, hey!
Charlie, stop!
Hey, Charlie. Hey, man. -Yeah?
it's Alan. -Hey. How are you?
I saw you coming out of a paint store a couple weeks ago and...
I was screaming for you, honking the horn.
I stopped the car, jumped out in traffic. It was crazy.
then I tried to get in touch with you, but nobody had any info on you.
Oh, good, good. Very cool.
how you doing? -So we know each other?
are you kidding me?
it's Alan Johnson, Charlie.
we went to dental school together.
Burrows Hall. I was your college roommate. You don't remember me?
Yeah, very cool. Very cool.
good. Good to see you, Burrows. -It's Johnson.
Charlie, you seriously don't remember me?
we were college roommates? -Yeah.
Yeah, you slept naked most nights.
and you were a sleepwalker. It was the worst two years of my life.
Hey, are you practising, man?
I tried to get in touch through the Dental Guild
I'm practising all the time, up in the valley.
took down 1 2 of the Colossus so far.
the valley? What is that? Is that a medical complex or something?
it's more like another dimension.
you take a journey and discover yourself.
Hey, man, you wanna go get a drink? -I can't drink. I can't drink.
I can't drink. I can't drink.
I gotta get going.
then a coffee or something. Let's just go get a cup of coffee.
real quick. I would just love to catch up with you, man.
Hey, Charlie.
this okay?
you like trivia?
name the Great Lakes.
the Great Lakes. Can you name them?
okay, Michigan is one.
Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior.
that was an easy one.
that's fifth-grade shit.
so, what have you been up to lately, Charlie?
I'm stuck between Pale White and Moon White.
I tried Butterscotch Yellow.
I couldn't live with it.
you painting something? You're remodeling or...?
you were my college roommate.
that was a long time ago.
a whole other life. -Oh, yeah. No shit.
it's good to see your face.
Johnson.
Yeah, it's good to see you too, Charlie.
Yeah. All right.
you gotta take those shoes off.
thank you.
great record collection.
Yeah.
I'm happy with it.
a lot of vinyl. -Yeah. Over 5500 so far.
it's a work in progress.
kitchen remodel?
what is this?
shadows of the Colossus.
can I use your bathroom, Charlie?
Oh, in the back.
nice music room.
good?
okay.
there you go, Allie. Thank you.
I'm sorry about the way I behaved the last time I was here, doctor.
but when I see you in the building, you always seem very busy.
preoccupied.
even when you're with the other doctors, you seem so solitary.
so alone.
I don't know why, but that seems very familiar to me.
Yeah.
well.
I hope you're
I just thought that if you wanted me to...
...I would.
with my mouth.
I would.
you could lock that door...
...tell the nurse not to come in.
I'd do it.
I'd enjoy making you happy.
you have to leave.
I have this odd sense of intimacy towards you. I don't even know why.
I told my shrink, and she said I should act on it.
Oh, she did? You need to get a new shrink.
get several. And get a new dentist too.
you gotta get out of here, Miss Remar.
I'm serious. I need you to leave right now. Please. Go.
okay.
come on.
okay.
the fuck--?
I need you not to reschedule Miss Remar for anything.
okay.
ever again. Nothing.
okay.
I don't want this woman as a patient.
got it. I got it. -Fine. Thank you.
excuse me!
not right now. Hey. Melanie, call her.
miss Remar? -On the phone, I mean. Don't
miss Remar, you need to find another dentist.
excuse me? -You heard me.
Dr. Johnson don't want you as a patient...
...neither do any other doctors here...
...so go somewhere, bury your face in the phone book...
...and find another dentist, all right?
bury your face in the phone book"? -Yes.
you have to be bold to make these kind of people go away.
thanks for holding.
can I help you?
I'm just going up to see a friend of mine, Charlie Fineman.
nobody by that name lives here. Sorry.
that's fine. I'll just wait for the landlord.
that's me.
landlady. Adell Modell, landlady from hell.
Oh, well, I'm Alan Johnson. I'm a friend of Charlie's.
sure. -We went to dental school together
I was in his apartment the other night. We were playing...
..."Shadows of the Colossus" or something.
you were up there in his apartment the other night? That's a load of crap.
he hasn't had anybody up there in four years.
just me, Sugarman the accountant, the cleaning girl.
he doesn't know about the cleaning girl.
I'm not lying to you. I was up there. -Yeah.
he's remodeling his kitchen. Now, how would I know that?
he's been remodeling that kitchen once every couple of months.
that tells me nothing. Go away.
Johnson. Johnson!
Alan!
alan Johnson.
this is my college roommate.
it's my college roommate.
I used to sleep in the nude.
check this out.
I got a... You'll appreciate this.
the Pretenders, It's one of the great debut albums of all time.
Yeah, that's you. Terrible taste in music.
no, no, not true. Not true.
smell these things.
I love the way they smell. Take a whiff.
brings back a feeling. Smells like the late '70s, don't it?
the early '80s. Yeah. -Charlie!
Charlie!
it's okay, Charlie. I'll take care of them.
who's that? -Charlie, we just wanna talk.
we gotta go. We gotta go. -What?
Why? Who is that?
Johnson, hop on. Hop on, Johnson.
hop on? -Get on. Get on. Johnson.
who is that? -Johnson, damn it, get on.
just get on the back. -Wait a minute!
Charlie! Charlie! Bus, Charlie!
Oh, shit! Charlie.
I know, I know. All right.
you're late. They're pissed.
name the one national U. S. monument that's movable.
suck my ass, retard. You're late. Get in there.
no. San Francisco cable cars.
good. I didn't know that one either. That's a good one.
that's a great one if you ever wanna stump somebody.
if you guys could not laugh at anything I say, that'd really...
I'm trying to get my self-esteem to go to, like, seven percent.
could I get another Heineken?
you want another root beer? -I got enough. Thanks.
Thanks.
Hey, it was fun watching you up there tonight, man.
it was good music.
I don't know if I'd go that far.
but you know what it reminded me of? It reminded me of school.
when you used to jam to that Bruce Springsteen album.
what was the name of that album? -Bruce Springsteen...
Yeah. What was that? The River, -The River? -The River, You remember that?
I was always trying to get you to play The O'Jays or Earth, Wind & Fire...
...but you always wanted to jam to The River,
I don't remember jamming to it.
maybe if you smelled it, it'd all come rushing back.
this was fun, man. -Oh, yeah.
I had a good day today.
riding around on that silly scooter. It was
it was my first time doubles.
it was fun. It was fun. -Yeah.
I don't do anything like that.
lot of girls here, Charlie.
that's gotta be half of the appeal, right?
why'd you ask me that?
I don't know.
I don't know. I'm just making small talk, you know?
you're single now. You can do whatever you
what? -After what happened...
...with your family and everything-- -Whoa, hey, I don't have a family.
no. No, I know. I was just trying to make small talk, but that was stupid.
who sent you here?
did they send you here? -What are you talking about?
are you a specialist? -A sp--? No, I'm not
what are you talking about? -Don't lie to me!
don't lie to me. Don't lie to me.
Charlie, calm down. -Why are you here?
Why? Why?
answer my fucking question. -Charlie, you're screaming.
why are you here right now talking to me?
relax. Okay? -Why? Why?
shit!
the fuck is wrong with you? -Why are you talking to me?
Oh, now I'm boring you? Mr. Heckler?
I'm bored too. I'm sorry if I'm boring you. I'm sorry.
you tell them to leave me alone!
Alan.
when you get a minute, we need to see you.
Alan, this is bad. The woman sent us a letter, threatened to file a lawsuit.
she claims that you sexually assaulted her in the office on several occasions.
that is ridiculous, all right? That's absurd.
well, we checked with Melanie.
Donna Remar. What do you know about her?
this woman is insane. Okay?
she came in, I put a single veneer on her...
...she tells me she's got this obsession
excuse me, Marie.
she said she wants to give me oral sex in the office.
you know what, you need to make this go away.
we can't handle a hit like this on our insurance.
even if we win, we're gonna get killed.
how do I do that? How do I make this go away?
I don't know how you make it go away. You see her again, you discuss it...
damn. I mean, isn't this exactly like what it was the last time?
woman falls for you, you lead them along
you know what, John? -No. No.
what, Johnson?
I'll get into it.
Dr. Johnson? I need to speak with you.
I'm Ginger Timpleman...
...and I'm Charlie Fineman's mother-in-law.
did you know Charlie's family? -No.
his parents died when he was in grade school.
he lived with an aunt before college. I met her a couple of times.
she passed just before the wedding.
you know, my wife and I, we tried to call him so many times.
hadn't seen him in years, and I read about what happened in the paper...
...and I was just-- I was just heartbroken for him, you know?
for them.
he just, you know, shut down.
quit work. He stopped wanting to talk about her.
then he acted like he didn't remember them.
then he pretended he didn't remember us.
Yeah.
all my husband and I wanna do is see him.
and that crazy landlady and his business manager, Sugarman...
...both conspire to keep us away.
Sugarman? -Yeah, I don't care for him.
who knows what that little shyster's taking from Charlie.
what is there to take? -Between the government payout...
...the insurance policy, Charlie has enough to take care of himself...
my husband retired young. He was a cop.
you know, we were young. Young to be grandparents.
I was gonna do nothing but travel...
...and spoil my granddaughters.
then those monsters flew over here from across the world...
...and rearranged my dance card.
sorry. -Of course you are.
but he needs help.
not the kind that landlady and some little accountant can give him.
he needs a therapist.
and he needs family.
guess what. Jonathan and I are the only family Charlie's got.
Hey. Hey. Somebody's at the door. Somebody's at the door.
Cherie. Cherie.
get away from the door. -What are you doing?
you don't go to the door in the middle of the night. You know that.
I think it's Charlie Fineman.
is that Charlie?
Oh, yeah, that's him. -Okay.
so let him in.
were you in bed already? What's going on? It's 10: 30.
I'm always in bed at 1 0: 30.
that sucks. That's grim. -You don't have any root beer on you...
...do you? -No, why?
Alan.
Charlie, this is my wife, Janeane.
Hi, I believe we met about 15 years ago in Central Park.
I don't expect you to remember it. -I don't.
okay.
this is our daughter Cherie.
nice to meet you, Dr. Fineman.
go to bed, sweetheart.
what's going on, Charlie?
you wanna go out, man? Go have some fun? Let's hang out.
right now? -Yeah, wake up. Come on. Let's
can he go out? Is he allowed out? -Charlie, don't do that.
don't ask my wife permission for me to go out.
I'm right here in front of you. I'm not 7 years old.
you're right. Can you go out?
she's threatening to sue you? What does she want?
she wants to go down on me.
well, you tell her you can't do that. -No, I know.
you tell her you're married? -She knows.
it's not a deterrent for this one.
I mean, she's got some kind of a fixation or something.
Oh, well, fix it for her.
it's not funny, Charlie.
no, no, no. -It's really not funny, I mean...
my partners are up my ass. -Right.
we already pay an obscene amount in liability insurance.
you should tell your partners they can do to you what the girl wants to do.
fuck them.
I don't know.
it's a five-year lease, 50 grand a month...
...my name on it. My partners get pissed off...
...and they leave me holding the bag, that's it, I'm done.
Yeah. -I put the whole thing together.
they act like I'm the one who works for them.
but the girl, what are you gonna do about that?
that's weird, you know? It's kind of heavy.
Yeah, it is. I'm telling you, this girl's seriously troubled.
Oh, yeah. She got a lot of problems if she wants to blow you.
she's out of her mind. I've seen that thing.
that's very funny. -No, no, no.
no, it is-- Are you having fun?
to tell you the truth, I kind of am, Johnson.
it's nice to see you in the soup like this.
it's funny. Just not used to it.
here. Take it easy. Take it easy. -Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
any chance of you getting audited this week?
because that would make things even better.
or maybe we could go somewhere...
...and you could burn your tongue on some pizza. I'd like that too.
I would love that.
I need you to hold for one moment.
you are not gonna believe who this is on the phone.
who? -The nut.
at this point in my life, you're gonna have to be very specific.
Donna Remar.
she wants to come in for another consultation for some more veneers.
can you believe that? Ma'am?
ma'am? -Schedule it.
excuse me? -Schedule it in my office alone.
morning, Oscar. -Hey, doc.
good to see you.
Hello, Dr. Johnson. -Hello.
I've got a question. -I'm sure you do.
no, it's not about me this time. -How refreshing.
it's about a friend. Really, though. I mean, really, a real friend.
he lost his whole family in a plane crash.
right. -It's horrible.
I mean, his wife, his three daughters.
this guy used to be a dentist.
how long ago? -It's a few years ago...
...and he's lost now. You know? He's completely lost.
I bumped into him. We used to be college roommates for two years.
he didn't even remember me. -Well, offhand, that sounds like...
...post-traumatic stress disorder. Maybe worse.
I couldn't really know without seeing him. It sounds like he needs help.
is he getting help? -I don't know.
I mean, the whole thing is...
it's really odd, you know? It's crazy odd.
how are you?
I'm fine. I got nothing to complain about.
does that mean you're fine?
very good. You are gonna be sending me a bill one day.
you might wanna check your mailbox.
okay. -Dr. Johnson, I think it would be...
...really good for you to talk to someone.
I just sense that it would be...
...Good for you to be a little bit more communicative.
I hope that didn't offend you.
okay. Well, I'll see you soon?
okay.
Charlie. -In the back!
hope the shoes are off. -Shoes are off. Shoes are off.
Hey, the kitchen's looking good, man. You almost done?
is that The River?
Yeah.
you know, I gotta get you enrolled in a music-appreciation class.
Oh, right, yeah. Tell that to Clarence Clemons.
what's going on? What's going on with the girl?
the crazy girl, the one who wants your penis. How's she doing?
