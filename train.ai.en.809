I need to review this with the director.
agent jareau.
ma'am.
Hotch. - Yes.
is everything ok?
Yes, everything's fine. Good night.
good night.
Reid, what did i miss?
Oh, man, you're no beeve this.
no, reid, the case. What's the case?
what are you talking about?
these emails from Hotch. "take a look at this," "new case to review."
emails from Hotch? I didn't get any emails from Hotch, did i?
nothing.
come in.
did you, uh, get a chance to look at the files?
I just got them. What's so important you couldn't send it to the rest of the team?
I just needed a second pair of eyes.
I'll review it right now. Just give men .
that's not necessary. - We're ready.
kristie taylor, runaway, drug addict, reported missing from Farmington, New Mexico years ago.
yesterday, she turned up off a freeway outside of rio rancho.
sexual assault combined with ligature marks on ankles. She was phyxiated.
3 victims in 5 years.
all the women are connected by marks.
definite sexual sadist.
he sticks to his type. 16- to 19-year-old girls, all blond.
hangs on to them for a while, too. Look at this.
average of 2 years between abducting them and killing them.
low body count, long time frame. This guy's in control of his urges.
too controlled. Sadists need new victims, new ways to torture.
there are a lot of guys out there who like chains.
are we sure this is the same unsub?
kristie taylor's autopsy report also indicates a second connection between these victims.
she was pregnant. - She'd given birth.
very soon after, the unsub killed her.
how soon after? - Minutes.
this unsub isn't your typical sexual sadist.
captivity and assault we've seen before. What we haven't seen is this signature.
the role he forces these women to fulfill before he kills them.
motherhood.
journalist william d. Tammeus wrote, "you don't really understand human nature unless you know why a child on a merry-go-round will wave at his parents every time around and why his parents will always wave back."
Gary Heidnik kept a harem in a dungeon.
his goal was to create a large family as a replacement for his own broken home.
Josef Fritzl kept his daughter in a cell in his own house, and they had several kids together.
squalid conditions are part of a control fantasy these men had.
if he's keeping these women in a similar location, he'd need a lot of privacy.
he probably built it himself. Makes him good with his hands.
why blondes, and what significance do they have to him?
maybe, uh, the woman who rejected him or the woman who wouldn't bear his children?
if that were true, he'd be the same age as these girls-- late teens.
this unsub is too skilled for that.
his own mother, then?
she could be a runaway, just like these victims.
which makes his compulsion psychology.
killing his mother over and over again for giving birth to him.
Yeah, but then why wait until after she gives birth?
now he has a body and a baby to get rid of.
uh, i hate to say this, but what if the women are just a means to an end?
what if the babies are really the ones he's exploiting?
if Kristie Taylor just surfaced, it means he has her baby right now.
JJ, check with the parents.
see if there are any similarities in the runaways' patterns, where the unsub's finding them.
Reid and Prentiss, go to the latest dump site.
we need to look at victimology.
how he treats these women in the final moments of their lives might tell us what he's doing to the children.
doctor, you wrote in your report that Kristie had had several miscarriages.
how was that evident?
there were a number of abrasions in her uterine lining.
around the third trimester, her water would break.
so she never carried to term?
no, last time she did.
there was a high level of pitocin in her blood.
it's an artificial hormone. You give it to induce labor.
she was on a tight schedule?
if she lost the baby, he would get her pregnant again immediately.
childbirth is tough enough.
imagine if your life depends upon it.
all 3 moms had records. Drug abuse, drunk and disorderlies.
but what's more interesting is what he does after he kidnaps them.
this is kristie taylor 2 weeks before she was abducted.
he got her healthy. - Well-fed and off the habit.
not completely.
these drugs in kristie's system-- what are they?
Tamoxifen, metoclopramide, domperidone, progesterone.
Progesterone's a prenatal medication, isn't it?
they all are. The first 2 help carry the baby to term.
the last 2 help with lactation.
Exual sadist gives his victims prenatal drugs?
the kind who takes care of the kids he's having.
he gets his rocks off killing the moms, but the babies he protects.
you think he's keeping them?
if he despises the moms, he'd despise their children, too.
new mexico's right on the border.
a lot of human trafficking going on.
this tight schedule he keeps the moms on-- he could be breeding.
call child protection services.
we need to find out about existing black markets for infants.
thank you.
there's no tire tracks.
the body wasn't dumped that far from the road.
this guy doesn't care about them, not enough to even hide them very well.
that's why this doesn't make any sense.
dump sites reveal something about the unsub, you know?
at the very least, a geographic familiarity, a place he knows he won't get caught.
OK, so he knows this road.
Yeah, except he abducted kristie in farmington and then dumps her here in rio rancho.
why drive that far just to dump a body by the side of the road?
a forensic countermeasure? Covering his tracks by sheer distance?
so the geographical profile won't do us much good.
no, it will, without the victims.
we profiled that it's the babies that he's interested in.
that's where he'll reveal himself.
the adoption company he sells through and whatever network of resources he uses.
he makes shortcuts there for convenience.
no one's gonna drive 100 miles for diapers or for a public notary for legal paperwork.
if the babies are in the system, they'll lead us to him.
child trafficking is huge in other countries, but here it's mostly a myth.
why is that?
there's an easier and legal path-- adoption.
there'd be a paper trail, though, wouldn't there?
there are ways to hide your tracks.
there must be a way to identify all these kids.
there's a court record for every adoption.
give us the records. We'll start weeding them out by date.
the adoptions in this state are closed.
the files are sealed. So it'll take time.
that's a luxury we don't have.
there's a child at risk right now.
all children who go in and out of the adoption system get basic genetic screenings for pre-existing conditions.
we have their DNA.
we can use that. We can match the maternal DNA with the babies" in the system.
we're still talking hundreds of kids.
that would make it go faster, yeah.
he kills these moms so soon after they give birth, secondary dna could still be on their bodies.
I'll call the m. E.
I understand. Thank you, doctor.
agent jareau?
I'm conrad winmar. This is my wife jane.
thank you for coming in.
why don't we talk privately?
you--you want to dig up our daughter?
we think the unsub might have left dna on her.
the last 2 victims didn't have any, but because monica was the first, he might have made a mistake.
back when they found her, the detectives said that they did not find his dna.
it's not his dna we're looking for.
we suspect your daughter gave birth while she was captive.
what?
the unsub has gotten all of his victims pregnant.
he might be putting the babies in the adoption system.
the baby's alive? - Possibly.
if we could find placental tissue on monica, we can test the dna against the state's records.
give us the release.
the first time i saw her, saw her record, too.
I never even thought to look for this.
what is it? - It's a baby's umbilical cord.
the child should be about 4 now.
I hope you find him or her. I really do.
thank you.
OK, know this-- most adoption folk are like the nicest, most dedicated people in the world.
there are, however, one or two skeezy ones.
how skeezy? - Super skeezy.
I've got a spread sheet from one of them expecting compensation for the baby i'm having.
something you want to tell me, garcia?
Oh, that's the sad part, my prince.
the genetically perfect offspring of penelope garcia and derek morgan wouldn't fetch top dollar.
who does? - White babies are in higher demand than minorities.
boys are more popular than girls, at least this year, anyway.
and then there's the swedish supermodel rule.
the what?
if i were to deliver a blond-haired, blue-eyed bundle of joy, i'd be set for life. I would.
Garcia, did the baby's dna turn up in new mexico's adoption records?
no. There's no hits on her profile. And it is a her, by the way.
this unsub could still be selling babies, just not through the system.
that's gonna make him a lot harder to catch.
all right. It's late. Let's get some rest. We'll hit this fresh in the morning.
Garcia out.
Morgan. I'd like for you to write up a preliminary profile.
we don't have enough for that.
well, that's why it's preliminary.
a work in progress profile helps show us what we're missing.
OK. Sure.
how you holding up?
we just wasted a day looking into a black market that probably doesn't exist.
at's no that i mean. I've heard whispers. You're getting some heat.
I'm taking care of it.
so, you, uh, think we have a tunnel vision problem?
I think we'd like to believe that we could save those kids, but look what he does to the mothers.
a lot of anger.
he's probably doing the same thing to the children.
his own children.
maybe.
Garcia said something interesting.
blond-haired, blue-eyed babies get top dollar in the adoption system.
all the mothers... Have blond hair and blue eyes.
you're gonna love this. This guy, he has like the best.
like there is no better.
he has like this access to god.
he doesn't want to hang on to it. He wants to give it away.
how much further? - Not much.
because that's what god's love is, you know, it's sharing.
it's giving everything you have of yourself away and not expecting anything in return.
where are we?
right here, baby, right where we need to be.
she's good, right? That's the kind of you?
she's perfect.
I know it's a long shot, but monica's parents said that she was heading west.
maybe she made it part of the way when she was kidnapped.
so why not run her dna against adoption records in surrounding states?
are you kidding? I think you're .
Hey, jj, if we find this little girl, what's gonna happen to her?
if something illegal transpires the adoption process, what the court nullifies it, the child gets returned to the closest blood relative.
if it helps, i have met with the grandparents.
they're wonderful ople.
Oh, i'm sure they are. It's just...
I don't know, i... I lost my parents.
granted, i was older than she is, but...
if monica's daughter is with a good family and we take her away from them...
are we doing more harm than good? - Yeah.
Garcia, i don't think we have a choice.
these people have a right to their granddaughter.
you're right. This sucks.
Yes, right away, please. Thank you.
I just called cps, asked them to send over infant mortality files.
- Good.
what's that? - Your profile.
I disagree with your analysis.
Hotch, are you serious?
but you only focused on one angle, morgan, of a wife or a girlfriend.
we need more options.
which i can give you once we make the proper deductions.
Hotch, you're asking me we need to guess.
Morgan, in order for the profile to be useful, it has to generate multiple scenarios about what the unsub is doing. Rewrite it.
we got her. Monica winmar's daughter.
she was adopted 4 years ago. She's lisa now.
how did garcia find her? She cross-referenced the entire new mexico system.
she wasn't in new mexico. She was in arizona.
so all the mothers were abducted and dumped in new mexico, but he keeps the babies in arizona.
he knows the police will stop looking at the state line.
the adoption agency's gonna be our best lead to the unsub.
who handled the case? - That's bombshell number 2.
she didn't go through an agency.
she was dropped off anonymously at a church.
hospitals and churches are safe havens.
you can drop a baby off, no questions asked.
child protection services would look for the closest relative.
another search that ends at the state line.
and if cps doesn't find one, the baby will go into foster care, which is what happened to lisa.
she was lucky. The adoption process happened within a month.
so, this unsub had the opportunity to make money off this infant.
he doesn't, drops it off at a church because he knows the state will take good care of it.
that's awfully considerate.
outside the murders, nothing about this unsub's behavior profiles like a sexl dist... As i wrote.
Yeah, morgan's right.
could our unsub be a woman?
uh, only a man would torture his victims this much.
men get off on this kind of violence. Women don't.
he could be married, though, his wife being a passive participant, taking care of the moms.
and the babies. - All right. We need to split up.
morgan how are you feeling?
terrible.
what are you on? - What? What are you talking about?
when he takes us, we're all on something.
I was an alcoholic. So, what are you on?
crack.
I'm carol.
I'm julie.
here. Here's some water. Come drink some.
is this some kind of tough love detox?
Oh, what is that?
it's like the sun. It gives us vitamin d. It keeps us healthy.
well, they can't make us stay here.
Hey, let me out!
I want to go home! I want my clothes! I want my phone!
let me out of here! Let me out!
why is he doing this?
what does he want?
your baby.
I'm not pregnant.
you will be.
the unsubs that we are looking for are a couple.
now, the man in the relationship most likely has a history of sexual violence.
he started with stalking, and then moved his way up to assault and rape.
and that violent streak ended temporarily when he found his wife.
for the first years of their marriage, look for wives who came into the E. R repeatedly and with obvious signs of spousal abuse, but you are gonna have to go back about 5 years.
that's because around the time of the first abduction, the visits stopped.
the sexual sadist can't find satisfaction from a willing participant.
he eventually got to a place where he couldn't escalate his violence against her without killing her, so she made him a deal.
he gets to kidnap, rape, and kill each of the runaways, and she gets to keep the children.
she's been giving the victims a series of prescription prenatal drugs.
the wife needs these children.
at first, they were the lifeline that kept her alive.
as long as he had other targets for his abuse, she avoided his rage.
so if these children protect her from abuse, why is she putting them up for adoption?
we believe the unsubs want children who resemble them physically, who no one would question as their own.
all of the runaways have been blond, which means the unsub.
if the baby doesn't have it, he or she ends up in the foster care system, wives of sexual sadists need outlets as a denial mechanism to cope with what their partners are doing.
and motherhood, especially taking care of a helpless infant is this woman's way of coping.
- We have.
how is she? - She's great.
she was adopted by a young couple.
so when can we take her?
right now we're in touch with her adoptive parents' lawyer, but the law is on your side.
can we talk to the parents? We could discuss this with them.
they don't want to initiate contact.
they've been through a lot right now.
they're her parents. Of course they don't want to give her up.
well, if she wants to see them, then we can work that out, but we are her family.
Absolutely.
no, wait. What are the risks here?
are we hurting her?
it's impossible to tell. Some kids do great.
others have trouble.
but why are we talking about risks? She's monica's daughter.
Conrad... - She's not their blood.
stop it.
thank you, agent jareau.
but my husband and i, we need to discuss this.
what's this? - It's the pattern i've been looking for.
the unsubs hid their tracks with the mothers, but they weren't so careful with the abandoned babies.
I gathered all the records for all infants who entered into foster care in a 2-week window following each mother's death.
then i narrowed it down to babies that were abandoned at churches.
this is where the guesswork begins.
Monica's winmar's daughter was abandoned at a presbyterian church.
let's assume the unsub, or the wife at least, is presbyterian.
that means all other unwanted children are gonna be left at the same denomination, right?
that narrows it down to 3 babies left at 3 different presbyterian churches all within this 20-mile radius.
this is where they live.
these kids you deduced to-- have you looked at their files?
no. Right now i've only been tracking churches. Why?
because you just uncovered another pattern.
Yeah, we're packing up now. We can be in phoenix in about 2 hours.
you sure about this?
the names of the babies reid found tells us everything.
we profiled there'd be a type they'd keep and a type they'd put into foster care.
they're keeping the boys.
it's time.
what are you doing?
what are you doing? Hey, where are you going? Come back!
you have to come back! Please!
they never stay for this part.
no, no, no, no. You're not actually
Yes...I am.
they've induced.
what am i supposed to do?
you help me.
1-1, 000...
2-1, 000... - No, no, no, i'm sorry, i can't.
I can't help you. I can't. - 3-1, 000...
I'm sick. I'm not well.
I need a... I can't do it. - Julie, listen to me.
are you listening to me? - Yes. Yes.
if this baby doesn't make it...
they are going to kill me.
and once they've killed me, they are going to move on to you. Do you understand?
OK. Ok. What do we do?
JJ, i need you to call these fertility specialists and get them over here for interviews.
Yeah, i know. Hotch wants to focus on the prenatal drugs the unsubs are giving the victims.
he thinks we can build a new suspect pool, and he wants it done yesterday.
there's 2 pages of names here. Shouldn't we narrow it down?
JJ, just do it, ok?
I'm sorry.
is everything ok?
Hotch be on me ever since we got here, and for the life of me, i can't figure out why.
Oh, i might know.
the before this case, chief strauss stopped by the B. A.U.
they were behind closed doors, and it seemed like it got a little tense.
well, the bureau's been on him for a while.
for hotch, that's... Hell.
Dr. Dekeyser, we don't think she's getting these prenatal drugs as a patient.
you're thinking she's writing the scrip for these herself.
something like that.
then she wouldn't be very knowledgeable about what she's doing.
some of these drugs have serious side effects.
there's dozens of meds i would prescribe before these, all of them more effective.
so why would she use these?
my guess--these are the ones she had access to.
fertility drugs are a cocktail, and you keep remixing the cocktail until you get pregnant.
the information is out there on the internet. She found the right one.
so the woman was prescribed these drugs maybe for some other illness and figured out that they helped carry a baby to term.
these drugs treat?
OK. I can do this. I can do this.
you remind me of me.
I can do this. Carol? Please?
OK, just--just focus on the sound of my voice, ok?
can you do that? - I'm here.
what happened to her?
she miscarried... A lot.
they don't like girls.
this isn't your first time, is it? - No.
what happened?
he didn't make it.
they let you live even if you lose him.
they want those boys.
OK. Ok, hey.
listen, i don't know what to do, ok, so please, please, just tell me what to do.
how dilated am i? - know what that means.
just put your fingers in a row and...
measure me. - Wait...
Oh, my god.
OK... Oh, my god.
it's 4. it's 4 fingers. And i
Oh, god, is that the head?
Oh, my god, what does that mean?
it means... It's time to push.
what is this?
it's a tactical arrest plan. I'd like you to write it up for this case.
you want me to write up how we apprehend these unsubs without risking the lives of the children.
Yes.
Hotch, i've led dozens of tactical assaults.
you've never made me write up one of these before.
that's because i always do it for you after each case.
you know what?
I'm sorry strauss is coming down on you.
this is not about strauss. - Really? I disagree.
look, i understand that you're under the gun.
but i gotta say it. I'm really not all that surprised.
I've watched you walk away from a bunch of cops gunning down unsubs in d. C.
you walked in unprotected to a hostage situation in louisville.
of course the bureau's worried about you.
man, i'm worried about you.
but just because you're the one who's under the magnifying glass, that doesn't mean i can't do my job.
Morgan, there's a big part of your job that i do for you because i don't need you worried about paperwork and politics.
I need you in the field focused and catching the next unsub.
but i can't do that anymore.
I don't have to justify my orders to you, and you do have to follow them.
I've always followed your orders when they made sense.
well, if you have a problem with this one, tell me now.
Garcia needs to talk to us asap.
and his short list of one disease these prenatal drugs also treat.
breast cancer. Progesterone, tamoxifen slow the spread. metoclopramide and domperidone are for anti-nausea if i remember correctly.
if this woman has breast cancer, would she be able to get pregnant?
- How dedicated?
well, she'd have to go off chemotherapy. She'd be in a lot of pain.
but she'll try anyway. Her whole life is children. That's her goal.
the first runaway, when was she abducted? - 5 years ago.
how many breast cancer patients in arizona got pregnant 5 to 6 years ago?
uh, let me see. Not a lot. 7.
how many of those patients are married to a man with a history of sexual violence?
just one-- robert and linda reimann.
Oh, jeez. - What?
she lost the baby in month 8. she had to go through labor anyway.
well, that kind of physical and emotional trauma, there's our stressor.
Garcia, was the baby a boy? - Yeah. They even named him--michael.
there has to be a name on the death certificate.
doctors encourage bonding between mothers and stillborns. I...
volunteer with a new mom counseling group.
they say it helps them cope with feelings of loss.
well, this unsub can't cope, so she's recreating them.
OK, come on, you're almost there. Just push!
Oh, my god.
is it a boy or a girl? - It's a boy.
you're here. You made it.
no.
don't. No! No, please, leave her alone. Please!
please, please, please, just wait one minute. Please, please!
it's a boy.
OK, commander, this here Is the unsub's address.
Now,5 years ago when the wife lost their child,
the husband started paying For home renovations with his credit card.
shower, toilet, tile, and mesh fencing, but he did not put up in his backyard.
he was building his dungeon.
no permits were filed for additional building on the property,
so the entrance must be inside the house.
how many doors are there to cover?
there's 2-- one in the front, one in the back.
we have the arrest warrants?
faxed over 20 minutes ago.
Morgan, what's your plan?
I think we should do a soft entry.
see if we can get the kids out Before the parents even know what's happening.
you'd be in the door first?
do you have another idea?
send prentiss and jj in first.
children are more likely to trust a woman, and we need that presence.
we don't know how many kids are in the house.
I mean, the parents could take a hostage.
but if we go in hot, That would definitely happen.
Hotch is right. This is the way.
it's ok. It's ok. we're the police. We're the good guys.
can you come outside with me? Ok. ok.
Hotch, we've got one boy accounted for.
he's on his way out to you, But there could still be more in the basement.
FBI. Where's your wife?
in the nursery. - Rossi.
Hotch. - Go.
I knew this would end.
I always knew you'd come to our door And take this away.
ma'am, why don't you give me the baby.
we can talk about it.
why would i want to do that?
what you've been doing is wrong. You must know that.
Oh, god, please, please get us out of here!
Oh! oh, thank god. thank god.
we're all clear here.
it's ok. it's ok, you're safe. come with me.
but no, i can't leave her.
all secure, but we need medical.
this is all i have left.
do you understand?
my husband hates me.
there's nobody here that can help me with him, With this, with any of it.
he's all i have.
please. I need you to think about the baby right now.
you're suffering from stage 4 breast cancer.
you've given your medication to the women That have been locked up downstairs.
you don't have a lot of time left.
I know you want somebody who will always remember you, don't you?
the baby's name is michael, right?
Yeah.
michael will remember you.
he's gonna know that you helped bring him into the world.
that's a part of him now. And he will always ask about you,
long after you're gone.
do you really believe that?
I do.
I would have been a wonderful mother.
then prove it.
let him go.
Where's my son? - We're looking for him.
please, don't let anything happen to him.
look, he's here. He's fine.
he's ok.
you are beautiful, aren't you?
I spoke with lisa's adoptive parents.
they've agreed to talk to you. They're not willing to give up custody,
but they do want lisa to know her grandparents.
Yeah, we-- we can live with that.
the reason why i wanted you to come by Was...
a year before giving birth to lisa, Monica had a son.
we've already matched his dna to your daughter.
the closest relative should take custody.
would you like to meet him?
what's his name? - Michael.
have a seat.
the bureau thinks that my ability To lead this team has been compromised.
what do you think?
sometimes i question you, hotch.
but at the end of the day, i do respect you.
you're the leader of this team, And my job is to have your back.
well, that's not important to the bureau.
they've been questioning me since foyet's attack.
and they're not entirely wrong. I've tried to do my best,
but what matters now is if strauss replaces me, This whole unit will come under scrutiny.
members will be reassigned, budgets will be cut.
come on, hotch, nobody's gonna replace you.
fight strauss. i'll go to the mat for you.
so will everybody else. you know that. - Morgan, it won't work.
decisions like this have their own momentum...
unless i step down.
step down? what are you talking about?
I'm resigning as unit chief at the end of the week.
what? No!
Hotch, look, yeah, ok,
sometimes your actions, i may disagree with them,
but it's not enough for you to leave this team.
I'm not leaving the team, I'm just no longer in charge.
you are.
me?
look, i had the chance to be unit chief in new york, And i said no.
I turned it down because i like this team.
Strauss can't just fire you like this.
she can reassign me.
and we can avoid that if i promote internally.
this is wrong.
it's the only way to keep the team together.
so all of this
this is why you've been pushing me so hard,huh?
I haven't been pushing you that hard.
Morgan, i need to know Right now-- Will you do this?
this would be temporary.
once we catch foyet, All this goes back to normal.
let's get started.
what's all this?
this is the job, Unless you have other plans.
not tonight.
the bureau thinks that my ability to lead this team has been compromised.
I'm resigning as unit chief at the end of the week.
what?
I'm not leaving the team. I'm just no longer in charge.
you are. - Me?
ms. Barnes, i'm sorry for your brother's death.
I know that sounds like something people say, but I truly am sorry.
thank you for helping me through this.
of course.
I think you need to cut contact with tamara barnes.
Penelope, she lost her brother. She just wants answers. I'm not involved.
let's go.
we have to hurry. - We are.
it's 10 minutes before curfew. - I'll get you there.
what just happened with ben? - It was just a peck.
only because you weren't alone, but next time
so are you going to text him tonight?
maybe. - Well, you should.
I don't know. I have homework to do still.
so what? I guess he is pretty cute.
No!
I don't know, it sounds like a promotion to me.
well, yeah, it-- it's complicated.
what isn't?
Yeah. It's just everything's happened so fast,
I mean, we haven't even had a chance to tell the rest of our team yet.
you know, i wanted to thank you again for...
coming to the hearing.
I didn't know if it was fair to ask you.
Tamara, i'm glad I could be there for you.
I think that the only time that I have felt sane at all in the past few weeks is when i've talked to you.
Really? I...
I feel like I'm the one who's been doing all the talking here.
you've helped me reconnect to my job.
to myself, really.
it's good to see you again.
it's really nice to see you, too.
so, listen, I know that your new job is a lot of responsibility and you're gonna have to commit a hundred percent, and you should.
but maybe when things calm down, i'll buy you a drink? Fair?
Yeah. It's more than fair.
also, i wanted to give you something.
it was william's. - I can't take this.
I want you to have it. Please. For being there for me.
when you lose a brother the way that I did, it's nice to have someone like you at my side.
so, did anyone explain why hotch is stepping down?
all morgan said this morning is that it's happening.
and it's business as usual.
so we're just supposed to move forward without any discussion?
after foyet, i think we'd have to be ready for anything.
did you pick a case?
agent jareau and I reviewed the requests this morning, and i've decided on oklahoma city.
why this one?
locals have more evidentiary information in other priorities.
this one, they have nothing. They need us the most.
good.
if that's all, i'd like to gather the team.
I'll be checking in. I expect to be briefed.
Yes, ma'am. - If you need privacy, please use my office.
that's ok. We're done here.
and when we get back, i'll clear everything out and it'll be all yours.
Hotch, i don't want your office. - I agree with agent hotchner.
the team leader needs a proper office.
all due respect, ms. Strauss, but both of you have trusted me to step in as acting unit chief.
I'm asking that you respect my decision.
I've decided that I don't want hotch's office. That's where he belongs.
if necessary, we can discuss this again at a later date, but right now, we really need to get started on this case.
guys. Grab rossi.
this is megan chertow and her friend bina sukarto, both 17, found 2 nights ago in a parking garage, carotids severed.
this is john o'heron, 61.
he was found dead in a wooded area 4 days ago, blunt force trauma to the head.
different m. O.
and completely different victimology.
how are the cases linked? - Their eyes have been removed.
Oh, he's an enucleator. - There's a name for this?
it's a rare subset of criminal behavior, but there have been case studies of assaultive enucleators.
the overwhelming majority of them suffer from diagnosed mental disorders.
and they're usually males, lack social skills, their kills are disorganized and sloppy.
the typical enucleator gouges the eyes out, but he doesn't normally take them with him.
this guy did?
we need to figure out why.
there are noticeable shifts from the first to second murder.
he goes from killing in seclusion to a public place.
and he escalated from one victim to 2.
what concerns me most is there's less than 48 hours between the murders.
that's why I chose this case.
and from what we know about enucleators, they're almost always multiple repeat offenders.
exactly. Which means he's going to need to kill again soon.
all right. Let's meet on the plane in 30.
Matthew 5: 29.
the color of all the victims' eyes are different, so that probably doesn't factor in to victimology.
it's more likely what he sees in the eyes.
case studies show that most enucleators suffer from delusions.
they hear voices and see things in people's eyes.
usually something evil. They're driven to enucleate to destroy the devil.
it points to someone who may have been institutionalized and recently released.
I'll have garcia start looking.
all right, so talk to me. What makes these attacks so different?
with victim one, there were multiple blunt force strikes to the head-- a more personal kill.
and he disposed of the body, maybe as a forensic countermeasure.
the next murders seemed less personal, more opportunistic.
I think we need to look at why the first victim was bludgeoned and dumped.
perhaps the unsub knew him.
Prentiss, i want you to go to the disposal site, see if you can figure out why he was dumped there.
Rossi, you and I are gonna go to last night's crime scene.
actually, uh, the girls' families asked to speak to our team leader.
all right.
OK, in that case, rossi, you can handle the crime scene solo.
JJ, you're with me, and, hotch, reid, I want you to get into john o'heron's life, see if anything at all points to a personal motive.
Phil brantley. Appreciate you all coming.
agent hotchner. This is dr. Reid. You'll meet the rest of the team later.
here's one. Excellent.
OK, here's where the first body was found, just outside of town.
and last night's murders were here.
and that's about 22 miles apart.
that's unusual. - What?
serial killers usually have a smaller kill zone.
it's our technical analyst. Hey, garcia, you're on speaker phone.
so, i looked up recently released mental health patients who have a history of eye gouging, eye assault, and other gross things you can do to eyes and sockets.
and there's no bingo for okie city residents.
any other recent attacks involving assaults on eyes?
there's one 9 months ago. He's not your guy 'cause he's in jail.
we'll call you later.
10-4, breaker breaker. - Bye.
you think he's fresh out of an asylum?
either that or he's been held somewhere and he's now free.
we've seen eye assaults before, you know, bar brawls, rage, domestic abuse cases.
but nothing like this.
what the hell's he doing with the eyes?
he could be collecting them as a trophy of some sort.
they wouldn't keep long as trophies.
eyes are 80% vitreous humor, which is essentially water.
after a few hours, they begin to get cloudy and wilt.
any other theories?
there have been cases where after enucleation, mental patients have consumed the eyeballs.
are you serious?
thank you for coming here. - It's no problem.
we can't leave our house. We have to mourn for 3 days.
buddhist rituals? - Yes.
did your sister call you while she was out last night?
no. I knew something was wrong. She always comes home by curfew.
does this man look familiar to you?
no. Why do you ask?
we believe he and your sister were killed by the same person.
it helps us to rule out any connection between the victims, and it tells us that your sister was most likely attacked at random.
Oh, thank you. - Thank you.
I asked to speak to you because we need you to do something for us.
it's ok. Take your time.
grandma said she saw bina's ghost last night.
her eyes were just big black holes.
bina was looking for her eyes.
she says bina's cursed.
she can't rest. She's stuck for eternity looking for her eyes.
we want to cremate her.
but we need all of her.
can you find her eyes for us?
we will try.
but realistically, we may not be able to.
then she will be cursed forever.
she may never rest in peace.
o'heron's friends say he has a history of drunken behavior, but they don't know anybody with a grudge against him.
he was last seen leaving a bar.
bartender on duty said he left without incident.
where did he go after that?
I checked out the disposal site where john o'heron's body was dumped.
it's a remote farm road.
the unsub didn't just stumble on it, he knows it.
we need a list of people who work or live near the area.
I got a bad feeling about this guy. - Why is that?
he chose that parking garage. He was patient.
he hid and waited for the right victims and the right time and place.
he blitzed them. It was all strategic.
that sounds way too organized for a typical enucleator.
add to that his lack of a cooling-off period between kills, it's not gonna be easy to get ahead of him.
I just got off the phone with the m. E.
she says there's something we should see.
the eyeball is held in the socket by 6 different muscles, fatty tissue, and the optic nerves.
these are pictures of john o'heron's eye sockets.
see the optic nerves protruding?
trauma. They were ripped out. - Maybe with fingers.
now compare this to my body on the table.
smooth inside, no bruising, no sign of trauma.
optic nerves retracted into the muscle and they have a clean edge.
so you're saying these were cut out.
with a sharp-edged tool.
he managed to avoid cutting the sockets or the eyelids.
this was precise work.
the kind of work only a doctor could do?
all I'm saying is that with both of these girls, it was a clean excision.
OK, so he was crude with the first victim, surgical with the others.
the amount of effort he's going through to remove the eyes now, he wouldn't destroy them.
he's keeping them.
it's secluded, but he chose a public spot again.
he's not afraid to get caught.
this is far from the other crime scenes. What brought him here?
well, he only killed one person this time.
it could have been more.
Hey, we found a car parked nearby.
I. D.'D her from a dmv photo.
Tracy copper, 32. Husband said she was an avid jogger.
single knife wound to the neck, eyes are missing.
cut out as carefully as the last ones.
Hey, garcia. So we have the list of local doctors, but we need to back it up one step.
where shall I splice, my pretties?
give me a list of all doctors who've had infractions like malpractice suits.
got it. Bouncing your way.
narrow it down to eye specialists.
whoo, that's still a lot of names. - We'll chip away when we know more.
Hey, wait. Before you hang up, how's my morgan doing?
fine. - I know the man is fine.
how's he holding up as head honcho?
well, he's stressed, but he's on top of it.
speaking of which, there is something you could do for him.
name it.
he must have hidden in these trees lying in wait again.
so he picked his location and then waited for a victim of opportunity.
he blitzes her because he lacks the social skills to charm.
that feels like the same pattern as the girls in the parking lot.
but he was quiet in the parking lot.
if he hid in these trees, there's too much dry brush.
he would have made noise. - No, it's too sloppy for him.
she was a serious jogger.
if she'd heard him, she might have been able to outrun him.
unless he surprised her some other way. Guys.
what is that? - A tripwire.
we need to look at her ankles.
he used the tripwire to get her off her feet.
she's stunned and she doesn't have time to run away.
he laid a trap for her.
all this, plus the way he bleeds her at the neck.
it's the behavior of a game hunter.
hunting's a big part of this city's culture.
Yeah, hunting animals is. What triggered him to start hunting humans?
this guys king yeah, hupeople's eyes, is. So he's definitely disturbed.
what bugs me is that people like this usually unravel, get sloppy.
and this guy's only getting better.
they're back.
Morgan, i'm fielding calls left and right here. - What's happening?
case made national news. They're starting to call him the eye snatcher.
all right, um, you're gonna hold a small, controlled press conference.
answer their questions, but try to squash that name.
I want the people to be aware, but I do not want to make a bogeyman out of this guy.
you understand? - Yeah. Yeah.
is there something else? - You're not answering strauss' calls.
she's just trying to keep tabs. She can wait.
Morgan. Maybe you should take the time to field the call.
Hotch, we have to set up a tip line.
we have to go over jj's talking points. We haven't gotten the profile out yet.
all of that takes priority over dealing with strauss.
I understand all that. Let us help you set up strategy while you talk to her.
we'll regroup with you before we proceed.
we have enough battles. Believe me, you don't want to fight her, too.
let me get this profile out, and then i'll go talk to strauss.
he's doing a good job. - He is.
have you thought about how this is going to end?
what do you mean?
morgan as our unit chief is a temporary thing.
it is.
he's a natural leader. He'll excel.
what happens when he's asked to step down?
we believe that our unsub may have known his first victim, yet the rest were random.
most enucleators have a mental disorder and are frenzied and sloppy when they attack.
this one has more control.
we are not calling him by any nickname.
he is simply a murderer that the fbi is trying to apprehend.
he lays in wait to kill his victims, knows how to cut them so they bleed out.
this indicates he might have a hunting background.
we're urging citizens to be hypervigilant at night.
he is killing in different areas of the city in public places.
his large kill zone could be related to some type of travel pattern in his life, which indicates a comfort with these neighborhoods.
why, all of a sudden, is he killing people every day?
the escalation might be caused by a self-imposed time line.
he has to murder so many people, take this many eyes, to accomplish a task.
so he's crazy, but he's got a mission?
actually, yes.
he's acting on a delusion that's fueling this murder spree.
for example, a man named herbert mullin.
he had a fear of a catastrophic earthquake hitting california.
now, he believed that by killing people and offering their blood as a sacrifice to the earth, he could prevent an earthquake.
he was a paranoid schizophrenic, and his delusion led him to kill 13 people.
uh, what should we look for when we're on the streets?
we believe he's a white male, 27 to 35.
we believe he is driving a van or a pickup truck with a removable cab.
something utilitarian that can get bloody and wash out easily.
he may also have applied for hunting licenses.
he has some sort of medical or surgical training but fell short of making a career out of it.
he may have been in a halfway house or have been granted leave from a treatment facility.
maybe his family moved him away and now he's back.
if you know anyone who fits these types of scenarios, please call our tip line.
our unsub kills at night, employs hunting tactics, and is patient.
he will wait until he can be alone with his victims.
chief strauss. - You're answering my calls now?
listen, i apologize for this morning, but I'm sure you can understand how busy we were.
so what's the strategy tonight?
I have the team visiting precincts all over town helping locals set up patrol.
and media outlets are warning citizens to be hypervigilant.
what about suspects?
nothing viable yet.
so ultimately, you're no closer to catching him tonight.
ust me, i well aware that he is probably out there hunting as we speak.
now, if I wake up in the morning and there are more victims, that is all on me.
look, I'm not criticizing you.
in fact, there are a lot of people who have faith in you and want to see you succeed.
do you understand that? - Yes, ma'am.
I'm just checking in to make sure your team is intact and that you have everything you need to do your job.
this team is solid, and we will get the job done.
we'll touch base tomorrow.
I'm dreading going to work.
you always say that.
Hey, i'll start looking for a new job.
we'll grab a paper in the morning and start circling whatever looks good to you.
did you hear something?
that's weird.
I see someone.
Hello!
Hello?
Wes? - What the hell's he doing?
I'm freaking out.
there's no reception.
let's go.
no, sandy. Not that way.
Wes, can you see? - Quiet, baby. He can hear us.
he's behind us. - Get in front of me.
I can't see anything.
get to the car. Down the hill.
go. Go, go.
go, sandy. Go.
no, please don't.
thought i'd beat everyone here.
no.
you here all night?
you know you can't do that again, right?
Rossi, when you walked in here, I really thought you were gonna tell me that there was another victim.
we're having no luck at all trying to find this guy on paper.
that's why we step away, get some sleep, come back fresh.
we're looking for a doctor who is also a hunter and a former mental patient who happens to be cutting people's eyes out.
trust the profile. When we get him, it'll all make sense.
good morning. - No, it isn't.
don't tell me.
a male and a female.
he's back to killing 2?
there's something different about this crime scene, though.
he cut the wires in the electrical boxes, killed all the lights.
so they couldn't see.
he wanted to force them off the trail so he could hunt them in the dark.
if they couldn't see, he couldn't.
he probably used some kind of night vision aid, like a scope, something a hunter would use.
her carotid was severed, and her eyes are missing, just like the others.
he didn't take the boy's eyes.
well, why not? What's so different?
there's a laceration on his left eye, the right eye he didn't even touch.
He'sot defenounds on his arms. He probably tried to fight back to protect the girl.
during the fight, the unsub could have cut his eye.
we said he might be collecting them. What if he needs a set?
an injury like that ruins the collection.
they're trophies. Oh, my god. - What?
I know this sounds crazy, but just hear me out.
a taxidermist?
morgan might be onto something.
the unsub's collecting sets of eyes that need to be flawless.
because he's preserving them as a trophy of some kind.
we said he was a hunter. What do hunters collect for trophies?
what if we're wrong about him being a doctor? It makes sense.
a taxidermist has all the skills and supplies needed to preserve eyes and other body parts.
do they know how to surgically remove eyes like this?
Yeah, they have anatomy knowledge.
they have to cut through muscle, tissue, and nerves in order to remove hide.
it's the exact same thing for eyeballs.
Garcia, you're on speaker.
comrades, i cross-referenced this john o'heron with okie city animal stuffers.
turns out he wrote a $250 check as some sort of deposit for lloyd's wild game shop 6 weeks ago.
now, this place is scant miles from the farm road where our first victim was dumped.
does lloyd have a record?
Lloyd bulford has one recent record from the city, and it is...
a death certificate. He died 4 weeks ago.
of what? - Emphysema.
any employees with criminal records?
he's got no employment records at all.
he has a 28-year-old son named earl who lives with him who has a petty crime record and 3 counts of animal cruelty.
Garcia, get everything on the son. - Okey-dokey.
Morgan, we may have someone.
I'm calling from oklahoma city bank and trust.
this is our fifth attempt to reach mr. Earl bulford.
we just want to remind you that you need to collect all your belongings and vacate the premises by sunday.
the eyes aren't right.
Where's your dad? He's gotta fix those eyes.
the eyes are good. - You can't do eyes!
here! I'm taking it somewhere else.
you can't do eyes.
is there any record of mental illness?
no, but mom had a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa, which would eventually lead her to go blind, and considering his crimes, that's super weird, right?
so, anyway, she died in a car accident when he was 8, and then he gets expelled from school for getting in a fight with a kid and trying to gouge the kid's eyes out.
I have no record of him returning to school, he has no employment records, he's never filed for taxes, he doesn't have a credit card in his name.
besides his driver's license, there's no record on him at all.
that's probably why he didn't show up on any of our lists.
sounds like he's totally dependent on his dad, and when dad dies, there's no one left to check up on him.
OK, dad drove a 1990 dark-brown chevy cargo van.
hot news--creditors took the house this week, and a lien was put on the business.
lost his dad, his house, about to lose the family business.
care to choose a stressor?
I'll take the back with brantley.
there's no van here. - Copy.
I don't see anything.
Hotch, i see blood. We're going in.
clear.
that's gotta be john o'heron's blood.
so he comes here to see his animal, they argue, and then this happens.
clear.
he's been sleeping here.
well, if he's not here now, then he's out hunting again.
neither does this one.
this one does.
this is what's he's doing with the eyes.
look at these.
he's been hunting since he was a kid.
never went to school. Probably spent his entire childhood in here.
somebody this socially isolated no doubt has mental issues.
looks like he only knew two things-- hunting and taxidermy.
which was fine as long as daddy was supervising him.
now his gatekeeper's gone and he's loose.
right over there, please. - Yes, ma'am.
this is much later than you guys said it was gonna be.
let me see it.
my daddy's gonna love it.
what?
I need something from you.
I think this is all of his customer information.
Morgan, prentiss. - Wait.
this address, junction road, it's close to where the teenage girls got killed.
I think he's attacking all over town close to where his customers live.
I know the customer on dry creek road, close to where that jogger got killed in the park.
and what about where the couple was murdered last night?
close to this address here.
OK, so he's delivering these animals to his clients' homes and then sticking around the neighborhood to find victims.
and there are 2 more addresses here.
all right, we should split up and go. - I'll get units to these locations.
all right, thank you so much.
the woman at the bleaker address hasn't seen him today.
no response at the other residence.
what the hell?
may I lp you?
I'm agent hotchner with the fbi. This is lieutenant brantley.
may we come in? - Yeah.
did you get a delivery today from a taxidermy shop from this man?
Yes, i did. - I need an apb in my area.
how long ago was this? - About an hour ago.
he said he needed something from me.
the balance I owed. I paid him and he left.
he creeped the hell out of me. - These are glass.
what is this about?
agent hotchner. They found the van. It's close.
excuse us.
he must be close by. You take the street to the north.
help!
I need backup near motor and descanso.
FBI, earl! Get off of her!
we got him. We got him! - Call an ambulance!
we need medical assistance. 8800 block of descanso, south side of the street.
secure him.
can you hear me? Help is on the way. Hold still.
hold still.
you can talk to the fbi when we come back.
what happened here? - Took him down by himself.
Brantley says you took him down solo.
he wasn't far behind me.
you know you should have waited for backup.
would you have?
what? - Nothing.
we got him. We're coming home.
you guys rock. - Right back at you.
so how are you doing on that special ops mission?
mission accomplished. - I had no doubt. Bye.
keep it.
there he is.
the team's at the hotel packing.
you think we can leave in about an hour?
Yeah. Yeah, we can try. - Hey, that's my stuff.
where did you get that stuff?
keep your voice down.
that guy was mean. He deserved it.
you know, you've got... Real pretty eyes.
get him out of here--now.
sorry.
JJ, did they find any more human eyes at the shop?
Yeah, a few. They're still looking.
they're hoping to match the eyes to the rest of the victims.
uh, listen, i may need more than an hour.
ms. Sukarto.
agent morgan. Did you find them?
we did. They're at the coroner's office right now.
they need to be processed for evidence first, but they can be sent to the funeral home of your choice tomorrow.
you have no idea what this means to us.
I really hope your sister can rest in peace now.
good night.
dwell in peace in the home of your own being, and the messenger of death will not be able to touch you.
guru nanak.
you are here late.
reports.
Hotch always stayed later than the rest of us, and now I understand why.
he doesn't have to write them anymore. Why is he still here?
I don't know.
but I do know I need to get some rest.
I got another case starting tomorrow.
um, i--before you go, can you help me get something out of storage?
Yes, baby girl. Anything for you. - Thank you.
Hey, what's that? I haven't seen it before.
Penelope, there's a lot of my stuff that you haven't seen before.
wow, you are a tease.
voila.
what are we doing in hall's office?
um, it's kind of not hall's office anymore. It's your office.
what? - Jj made some calls.
agent hall's retiring in a month, but he's finishing his caseload at home, so, while you all were away, mama set to work clearing out the rest of his boxes and setting up an uber office fit for our acting unit chief.
Garcia, this is for real?
it's kind of blah for my taste, but I figured you needed to keep up with agency standards.
I did make you your own...
secret fun zone.
woman, you have lost your mind.
but you are the best.
I completely agree. - Come here.
I will leave you alone to mark your territory.
thank you. Very much.
you are ever so welcome.
it's me.
Yeah, i'm back. Listen, uh...
does that offer for a drink still stand?
best show ever, dante! Great show!
nice job! Beautiful. Just let me
Hey, uh, look, you're not allowed to be over there, all right? Stay there.
here he comes.
I know. I know. I know.
he looked right at me. Did you see that?
I saw it. I saw him look right at you.
we had a connection.
when he sang "resurrection" it was like everyone in the theater just disappeared.
he is so beautiful. So beautiful. - Totally, man.
so beautiful. - This is us.
both of you? - Yeah.
we live on the same block, dummy.
I could, uh, walk you to your building. - What?
I mean, it's--it's dark. - So?
we gotta go. - I'm just saying, it's dark. I could walk you
I'm pretty sure I'm tougher than you are, ted.
thank you for taking us to the concert, though, ted. Yeah. - Bye!
Bye-bye. - It's ed, not ted.
the latest victim is tara farris, 20.
she's the third victim in 2 weeks.
all found on freeway off-ramps by commuters.
well, he's not hiding them.
an l. a.freeway during morning rush hour? He wants them found.
quickly.
well, they're still dressed. That minimizes the shock value.
maybe he's concerned for them. Think he wants them taken care of?
no signs of sexual assault on any of the victims.
look how pale she is.
all of them were severely hypovolemic.
Tara had less than a pint of blood in her.
look at this. The first 2 had more than 3 pints each.
if exsanguination is the goal, the unsub is definitely becoming more proficient.
this is new. Tara's the only victim to have a written message.
the liar.
the" liar. That's strange, isn't it?
not a liar or just liar.
so what did you lie about, tara?
all of the victims appear to have been strangled and then bled out through identical wounds in the throat.
Wait--seriously, are those supposed to be fang marks?
all of the wounds on the victims were covered in saliva.
human saliva, as though-- - Someone drank their blood.
in all the darkest pages of the malign supernatural,
there is no more terrible tradition than that of the vampire.
a pariah even among demons.
writer montague summers.
OK, thanks. So they've already set up a task force in los angeles.
this isn't their first serial case.
you remember detective owen kim? - From the stalker case.
you remember that case, don't you, spence?
I do remember that case.
Yeah, you ever talk to, um, lila anymore?
you know, i think we should probably focus on this case right now.
it's a little more pertinent.
all right, so tell us about blood-drinkers, reid.
human blood consumption, or clinical vampirism, is known as renfield's syndrome,
named after the insect-eating character in bram stoker's novel "dracula.
are they sadists? - Not necessarily.
pain to the victim is usually only a byproduct. Blood is the focus.
renfield's syndrome is usually accompanied by varying levels of schizophrenia
and occasionally more classic cannibalism if the condition evolves.
classic cannibalism. Lovely job we have.
I will say this-- true cases are exceedingly rare.
that's comforting. Sort of.
renfield's may be rare, but vampires are anything but.
and there's a huge subculture in los angeles of the red-drinking undead.
why is that not a surprise?
Garcia, all these people drink blood?
au contraire. They mostly just dress up like prentiss did in high school and they make believe.
it's all kinds of delicious. - It's not the same thing at all.
as a matter of fact, we should refer to this unsub as a vampirist, not a vampire.
and they would be attracted to the subculture merely for its professed worship of blood.
OK, i'm going to continue spelunking through the various online sites,
see if anything jumps up and bites me.
Thanks, baby g-- Thanks, penelope. Stay close.
Yes, sir. Garcia out.
you guys, one more thing-- vampirists are coveters.
they most generally always have some sort of relationship with the victim,
even if it's tangential. And they're likely to become obsessed.
they've almost certainly crossed paths in some way.
it's ok. It's just me. It's ray. You still in bed?
I'm sick.
look, dante, you're already late.
don't call me that. - Sorry, but, man, you gotta get going, ok?
I said no.
the record company is gonna be pissed again. If you're not
get out!
I know you hate these parties, but you've got to sell the record.
you can't blow this off. It's your job, man.
and it's my job to make you go.
do I have to be him?
you know that you do.
I'll be down in 20 minutes. - Great. I'll make you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
what happened to you last night? - What do you mean?
after the show. You just kind of disappeared.
I don't remember.
Hi, lieutenant kim. Agent jareau.
JJ, of course. I remember most of you.
agent hotchner. Reid. Morgan.
welcome back to the left coast.
these are agents prentiss and rossi. I believe they're new to you.
pleasure.
we already have a room set up full of glass boards, case files, and extremely bad coffee.
we've worked with a lot less.
agent morgan's in charge now. It's his show.
long story.
I know you like to start with the freshest information and work your way back.
so tara's apartment has been processed and sealed in case you want to go there.
and her body, along with that of the first 2 girls,
is at the morgue with an m. e.waiting there for your call.
all right. Jj, get set up here, and then hook up with garcia.
send her the witness information so she can start cross-referencing with the first 2 victims.
Reid, i want you to go through all the case files,
set up a preliminary profile based on what you already know about the psychopathology.
and the rest of us, let's find out what we can on tara.
so we're looking for a connection between the witnesses.
when vampirists become obsessed, they aren't likely to find a random victim.
if we can find a cross-relationship, someone in all the victims' lives, that'll be incredibly helpful.
Gina king knew tara the longest. They apparently had some classes together.
let's get all the information we can on that relationship.
as a matter of fact, get me everything you can on all of tara's friends.
all right. In the morning i'll track them down and do some follow-up.
that's fine.
Dante. This is jeff from "metal life" magazine.
he's writing a story on artists who cross over
cross over. Is that what I do, jeff from "metal life"?
I guess, kind of. You're not totally goth, right?
that whole vampire thing you do is
Ah, the vampire thing?
Yeah, your act. It appeals to certain people.
it appeals to desperate, sad people with, at best, a tenuous hold on reality.
can I quote you on that?
sure. Knock yourself out.
no, don't use that quote. 'Cause I can just get him back, get another
you know what, don't even bother, man.
he was old news 5 years ago. Where's the scotch?
listen, here's the thing, he's not on his game lately.
this is almost exactly like my first apartment in georgetown.
my mom wanted me to stay on campus, but I was determined to make it, so...
I waitressed on the weekends to swing it.
you must have been a hell of a waitress to swing an apartment in georgetown.
no, i sucked. I only got by 'cause my mom put money in my account every week and we both pretended I didn't know.
looks like she was studying to make movies.
who is this guy?
well, if you want to look into a young girl's life today,
you have to access her myspace, facebook, and twitter accounts.
I'll call the sexiest hacker on the planet.
I don't think he's going to print that quote.
who cares?
you shouldn't say stuff like that about your fans.
maybe i'll just jump off. I mean, i'm a vampire.
maybe I could just fly away.
I don't like that kind of talk.
what's wrong, ray, afraid you're gonna lose your cash cow?
what's happened to you?
it doesn't matter. - Come on. We used to have fun, remember?
I don't make music anymore.
I make events. I play a character.
you sell records.
it's not as if I exactly light up the sales charts anymore, anyway.
you'll sell again.
ray, you may be the only friend I have left, but...
you're a pretty crappy liar.
I'm so sorry! - It's my fault. It's my fault.
let me help you.
interesting hand.
do you know who I am? - Yeah.
I mean, you're the music guy. This is your party, right?
Yes. This is-- This is for me, but...
I have a pocket full of what will make us both feel so much happier.
you do? - So let's get out of here.
Really? - Yeah. Come on, let's go.
you won't be sorry.
the saliva hasn't been dna i. d.'d, but we have it going through the lab.
you can have the samples sent over to the local bureau lab and have them rush it.
you should have something by sometime tomorrow.
I'll have it sent right over.
they're not bites. Look at the edges. They're razor sharp.
a tooth would leave a ragged, torn edge.
I have some photos of animal bites on the table for comparison.
some sort of boring instrument, then?
very sharp and very efficient.
well, if it isn't a bite, then the saliva, is it from licking, afterwards?
maybe. I haven't seen anything like it.
once an unsub like this gets started... It only gets worse.
this is chase manning, news chopper 12, over the 101 freeway in the san fernando valley.
apparently a second body in as many days has been found near an off-ramp.
so much for keeping the media out.
Penelope? - Are we in yet?
all yours.
I always feel skeevy going through someone's life like this.
OK, so everything looks like it's password protected, so you might not even be able to
you're in already, aren't you? - The password was cullen.
of course. - Colon?
Cullen. The vampire family from "twilight.
what's "twilight"?
do you ever read anything other than technical books?
not much in english.
OK, i'll see what I can dredge. My love is strong.
OK, thanks.
how's the profile coming? - I don't know. I never really feel ready, you know?
it'll be fine. I am gonna go talk to tara's bff before the media requests come in and it gets too crazy.
what's a bff? - Best friend forever.
should I go with you? - No. You have a profile to deliver.
I should really work on it a little more.
Reid. - What are you doing with my phone?
Derek, hey, um, spence is ready for the profile.
why, yes, he is, right here.
I'll be back.
all right, reid. We'll be right in.
Hotch, reid's ready with the profile. - Good.
Highway crew found her just as the sun was coming up.
how long's she been here?
barely even cold yet. Hour, maybe.
the liar. - The same message.
apparently it wasn't tara-specific.
I wonder what it means, then.
the first victim on a consecutive day.
detective kim, can you have your crime scene techs keep us apprised of the processing?
we're ready with a preliminary profile.
that's quick. - So's this unsub.
we aren't looking for a vampire in the supernatural sense,
only in the sense that this unsub has a very strong desire, a need, for human blood.
now, fortunately, vampirists display several characteristics which will be helpful in finding him.
he will have cut himself repeatedly.
it's called auto-vampirism, essentially becoming his own first victim.
it's the way by which he first tasted human blood.
most vampirists are incredibly ashamed of this and will wear long-sleeved shirts in order to conceal it.
secondly, there will be a long history of animal abuse,
starting with smaller animals such as insects and rodents and then working his way up to larger things-- Dogs and cats.
though this is a well-recognized component of the homicidal triad seen in other serial killers,
in the case of the vampirist, it's more pronounced.
there will, interestingly enough, not be any animal torture,
as with other psychopathologies.
the killing isn't the point, it's merely a means by which to obtain the blood.
look hard at your animal control sections records, as far back as you can.
they will probably have some record of this unsub as an adolescent.
this guy also most likely lives in a poorly kept older home.
he needs a house for the privacy, not an apartment.
it takes some time to drain a body completely of blood.
uninterrupted time.
this unsub also most likely lives with an elderly woman, a grandmother, a mother, even an aunt.
how could you know that?
this type of mental illness, accompanied by extreme schizophrenia,
dominates a family's entire existence.
it often leads to a broken home, and a woman ends up as primary caregiver.
the men generally leave.
Oh, and one more thing. This type of disorder cannot be hidden for long.
I guarantee you someone out there already knows this unsub is very, very sick.
you ok? You all right? Should i--should I call somebody?
tell me what's happening. Talk to me. Talk to me.
Oh, my god. I can't stop it.
I want to. - Yeah.
but I can't stop it.
you gotta help me. - I know. I will.
you gotta help me. - I will. Are you all right?
I can't stop it. - Talk to me.
come here.
we're gonna fix this, ok? I'm gonna fix this.
agent morgan, we've identified this morning's victim.
Erin hickman. She worked for a caterer at an event last night.
they're still there cleaning up.
where can I find ms. Masters?
she's right there. - Thank you.
excuse me. Ms. masters? I'm lieutenant kim, lapd.
is this about erin? - Yes, ma'am.
is she really dead? - Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.
these are FBI agents morgan and prentiss. - Fbi?
Erin hickman work for you? - Well, till last night.
she walked out on me in the middle of the party. - Walked out?
all I know is she was here one minute and gone the next.
was it uncommon for her to be irresponsible?
look, i don't want to speak ill of the-- she had a problem with drugs.
excuse me.
Morgan. We saw a poster of him in tara's house.
speak to me, vision.
Garcia, give me everything you've got on a singer named dante.
Dante, the vampire guy? I was just about to call you.
you know him?
uh, he's the one thing that all of our victims have in common.
what do you mean?
they have cyber shrines set up for this guy.
they worship him. They're obsessed with his music.
well, his new album comes out today and it's called "the liar.
the liar," I know. And isn't that what was written on them?
OK, uh, all of our victims, including the first two, were diehard fans.
Tara and gina-- that's tara's friend-- they were practically running his fan club.
what about erin hickman, our latest victim?
Erin hickman--i haven't run across that name.
OK, we need to talk to this dante guy.
Garcia, can you get us an address?
that's gonna take a little while.
these celebrities are protected by layers of privacy.
it's like finding information on a deeply
22423 greenvale circle, holmby hills.
GPS coordinates are uploading to you now.
and his name is paul davies, by the way.
run him for a criminal record, too.
you got it. - Thanks, p.g.
I'd hate to think what she could find out about me.
Oh, i prefer not even to consider it.
it doesn't look like a lot of poorly maintained single-family homes.
no.
I hate to ask this, but are your profiles this far off sometimes?
they haven't been yet.
this probably isn't our unsub, just a piece of the puzzle.
I could get used to this.
this is definitely not poorly maintained.
one of these things does not belong.
Hey, garcia, can you run a plate for me?
this isn't our guy, is it? - I highly doubt it.
may I help you guys? - Dante?
no. - You're not the singer?
Dante's not my name. He's a character I play. So who are you guys?
we're investigating a murder-- - Sir!
would you mind coming in to answer a few questions?
Prentiss, what are you doing?
that car is erin hickman's car. The victim's car.
would you mind coming in, sir?
this is elizabeth chambers outside the los angeles police department with a story we're still developing.
the singer-songwriter known as dante has been taken into custody by the FBI
as a suspect in a recent string of murders in the los angeles area.
what's it been, 30 minutes?
what about your music?
welcome to the media capital of the world.
Oh, god.
how the hell did they get here so fast? - Who knows? They always do.
now listen up. We're gonna have to push through.
can you at least put a jacket over me or something?
if we're gonna go we gotta go now.
back off! Everyone back off! Back off!
back up, please! Back up! Back up!
I'm with the fbi! I have an official statement if you'll just come over here, please.
is he gonna be ok? - He's got a gun. Keep moving.
right in here. Thank you very much.
OK, this is just a preliminary investigation right now.
a lot of this doesn't add up.
we've been wrong before. - Not this much.
the plot thickens.
he was arrested for domestic violence 10 years ago.
how bad.
well, garcia was able to find the battery charge, but it was expunged, so who knows?
again, welcome to celebrity justice.
he's pretty agitated. - I wonder why.
celebrities out here aren't used to being put in the box.
this seems more than that, though.
I don't know. These are people everyone falls down around, defers to.
adulation is their norm.
you know, prentiss, that may be a good way for you to play him. - Me?
you were the one who pointed at him. He may see you as an adversary.
have him off-guard.
so, what did you tell the press?
my official statement was that I hate los angeles. What's happening?
Prentiss is gonna take the lead. - Good choice.
remember, if he is the unsub, he's ashamed of the disorder, so use that to your advantage.
tell him you can't believe that someone like him could do this.
throw him a lifeline. - Right.
ask him for his autograph.
right. Right. Adulation.
Mr. Davies. Have a seat, relax.
relax? How the hell am I supposed to relax?
please sit.
I've been trying to call my manager, but I can't get a signal.
these interrogation rooms don't usually have cell service.
is there another phone that I can use?
I--I think there's been a really big mistake.
there's been no mistake.
I'm sure that you couldn't have had anything to do with what's happened.
Really? I mean, you're the one that brought me in here.
the police gave me some bad information.
you're not the police? - Good, she's confusing him. Schizophrenics can't follow that.
neither one of us is the type of person who belongs in a police interrogation room.
supervisory special agent emily prentiss, federal bureau of investigation.
FBI?
and, of course, I know who you are.
I'm a big fan.
Really? - Does that surprise you?
Yeah. Yeah, that's a surprise.
OK. Well, before we get started...
would you mind?
would I mind what?
well, i hate to ask, but I don't usually get opportunities like this.
what the hell is this? You're no fan of mine.
you people think I'm stupid.
that kind of contradiction should completely confuse a schizophrenic.
they can't make sense of it.
am I suspected of something?
Wh'she name they canof your new album, t. The one that comes out today?
is she-- Dead? - Yes.
with the name of your new album written on her.
it's a common phrase. - Is it? It seems a little odd to me.
the instead of a.
and this girl went home with you last night.
she's dead?
can you explain that?
I--I don't-- I don't remember.
you don't remember hurting her? - No. No.
their blood was drained.
from holes in their throats. - What?
are you a vampire, mr. Davies?
you can't be serious.
it's a character I play, a stage act.
you know, sometimes things get out of hand.
no, no. This is--this is crazy.
I don't know how that girl ended up like that.
I think I need my manager here.
you're gonna do this all on your own, just like a big boy.
but I have the right to a lawyer.
are you asking for an attorney? - No.
I'm asking to speak to my manager so he can find one.
I need a phone. I need to make a call. I need to make a call.
there's nothing you can do when they lawyer up, prentiss.
Dr. Reid here. - Spence, what's going on?
the possible suspect's some sort of rock and roll star.
Seriously? - Yeah. A lot of it doesn't fit the profile, though.
anything I can do? - There's a lot of media attention.
all right. Well, I'm already here at gina's house, - so let me get some info and i'll be back. - Great. Thank you so much.
none of this makes any sense. - No.
television is saying his new record is selling through the roof.
all of his stuff is.
as soon as his being questioned in an actual string of murders became public.
what do they say? Any publicity's good publicity.
what are we gonna do with him?
well, he wants to talk to his manager, so maybe we let him make that call and find out what that guy knows.
it's worth a try.
you sure? Ok, thanks. - Something?
that's the lab. The saliva samples from the victims' throats-- the dna's from a woman.
stop. Don't to that. Grandma's asleep. She's gonna wake up.
so you have to stop it. I need to go to the yard.
Gina. Gina. I'm with the-- fbi.
a woman? That's incredibly rare. - But not impossible.
no, but renfield's with this type of aggression-- it almost never presents this way.
OK, we knew something was wrong. Our profiles have never been this far off, reid.
go back and work it with a woman. See if there's anything we may have missed.
you wanted to call your manager.
can I have some privacy? - That's not how it works.
ray. - Holy hell, man, the record's gone through the roof.
what do you mean? - Yeah, it's flying off the shelves.
I told you I'd fix it. I told you. Yeah, everything's good.
you're gonna be back on top, everything's gonna go right back to normal, you can stop doing the drugs.
ray, i'm at the police station with the fbi.
I know, i know, i know. Don't worry about it.
don't worry? - No, don't--don't worry about it.
look, there's nothing that could be tied to you, absolutely nothing.
it's all good, man.
come on, let's go. Yes.
what did you do, ray?
the less you know about it the better.
look, i gotta take care of this thing, and then i'll be right back.
I'll be down there. Let me just fix this.
ray-- - hey, relax, would ya?
it's gonna be all right.
did he do something?
I don't know.
what did he say?
he said he'd be down to fix it.
fix what?
fix this, i suppose.
but he didn't ask you what "this" was.
no.
Gina. My name is jennifer jareau.
Gina, where'd you go?
who the hell is that?
what kind of fan mail do you get, mr. Vampire?
a woman--what changes, what doesn't?
older female...
Oh, no.
Yeah. - Uh, reid, uh, i found fan mail to dante.
vampire fan mail. It's bananas. - Obsessional?
ad infinitum and beyond. Tara's friend gina
the stuff she writes-- she--he's her god.
a vampire god. She lives for him. She said she'll kill for him.
and she fits every other piece of the profile. Guys!
the girl tara was with before she died-- gina--it's her.
do you have an address? - Yeah. I think jj is there right now.
let's go.
who the hell is she?
I'm so upset. It's all going to go bad.
forget that. You've got-- you've got to kill her.
it's all going bad.
listen to me, we've got to help dante. You gotta help dante again.
Dante? - Yeah.
he's--he's-- he's gonna be angry.
no, no, no, no. I promise. He'll only be angry if you don't kill this woman.
listen, you gotta hurt one more girl and then you'll be able to join him in the undead. Ok?
she isn't answering. - Keep trying.
you just have to do one more and dante will be able to live then. - Just one?
just this one more girl and then you can join the undead, just like we promised.
you said that tara was the last one. That's what you said. You said.
now it's the other girl-- - this is the last one.
the last one that you have to do, and then you can join dante and be the undead.
just like we talked about, remember? Remember?
just one... - Just one more.
and then yourself. Just like he promised.
just one... Ok. - Just one.
last one. - Last one. Take it. Go on, take it.
beautiful.
where did she
don't move.
in the back!
mine. This is mine. It's mine. You can't-- you can't have it.
go away. Go away.
show me your hands! Let me see your hands!
it's ok. It's ok. - Get your hands clear!
no, no, please, you have to-- no, no, no, no! No, no, no!
the blood is going bad! Please! Please don't do this!
are you armed? - No, no, no. No. Go, go!
Hey, i got nothing to do with this. Hey, it's not me.
it's the chick. It's got nothing to do with me.
has something happened?
it was your manager.
he used a fan of yours.
what? - A young girl.
she'd been writing you letters about wanting to kill someone for their blood.
I never--i never received anything.
no, he did.
and I guess he thought he could use it for publicity.
he was right. Your new album is selling very well.
I never asked for that. - Well...
where is he? - Your manager? He's in custody.
is he ok? Is there anything I can do for him?
he's gonna need a good lawyer.
what about the girl?
I don't know where she'll end up. She's pretty sick.
I'd like to help her, too, if I can.
that's all? I can go now?
that's all.
you know, all I really ever wanted to do was make music.
and I'm not sure when that stopped being enough.
Hey, do you guys think davies will continues to perform as dante?
the character's probably responsible for the murder of 4 women.
if he has any conscience at all, dante died with them.
Thanks. - Are you ok?
Yeah. Doctor said it'll be sore for a while, but I'm fine, really.
I feel so bad I didn't go with you to interview gina.
Spence, stop, all right? We had no way of knowing she was gonna be dangerous.
she was just the friend of a victim.
granted, a schizophrenic friend with a sociopathic partner.
and a shovel.
seriously, reid, we had no way of knowing that gina had that type of anger inside of her.
Yeah, but she was obsessed with dante.
I should have known that that level of fixation can lead to manipulation.
but only when the fixation's coupled with schizophrenia, which we had no way of knowing.
still it never ceases to amaze me how dark obsession can get.
and with a pop star?
I mean, i was obsessed with the rat pack, but I wouldn't have killed for frank or dean.
no, you just drank whiskey and smoked cigars.
this from the man who's favorite record is the beatles' white album.
just because manson hijacked it doesn't have to ruin it for the rest of us.
that's why I stick to beethoven.
there's no chance of guilt by association.
well, yeah.
have you ever seen a movie called "a clockwork orange"?
writer cyril connolly said,
now, from these experiments, a few factors became evident.
one was the realization that serial killers have been with us since the dawn of man.
please, let him go.
take whatever you want, take anything, but please let my son go.
my name is professor james fallon.
I'm a scientist-- neuroscientist-- and I study the human brain.
it is a complex and sometimes lethal machine.
in a blind experiment, colleagues sent me 70 mri brain scans, and I had no idea who these brains belonged to.
some were normals, some were schizophrenics, and some were killers.
I analyzed all of them, 5 of which I determined were the brains of psychopaths.
and it turned out that, indeed, these 5 were the brains of serial killers, some of whom you know.
in studies such as these, one looks at the biological factors...
that is, the genetics and also the brain pathology.
the 5 brains we identified all had damage to the orbital cortex, which is right above the eyes.
now, high-risk allele of the monoamine oxidase a, the maoa gene may also be present in these people, and that's key.
now, under the effects of the high-risk gene, the brain of the psychopath was bathed in way too much serotonin during fetal development.
as an adult, this brain is now numb to seratonin's calming effects.
the first dangerous elements are now in place.
the damage is done.
now, this is a recipe for catastrophe.
so when the fetus reaches the day of labor, the potential serial killer is born.
mom!
mom!
Hey, how was your weekend?
uh, scary yet informative. Was the whole family killed?
Hudson, this is dr. Spencer reid.
field agent anne hudson. The, uh, father is serving in iraq.
3 nights ago the cops found his family buried over there.
buried?
the neighbors heard the dog barking, came over, and he was scratching at the grave.
Lucy, their oldest child, she's still in her swimsuit.
what does the father know? - Some of it.
he was on patrol.
took his unit a couple of days to reach him. He arrives today.
last year the williams family was killed and found exactly the same way.
they lived in newport news.
the father, dan williams, was also serving overseas.
now, the police are overwhelmed and getting serious heat from the military.
we need some answers fast. - As do the media.
they're already calling this the work of a serial killer.
they're right. It is.
but why bury them? I mean, it can't be to hide the bodies.
it's a sign of remorse.
and when they're done being remorseful, this will happen again.
Albert einstein.
no sign of a struggle.
unsub holds a gun to one of her kids' head.
what can she do?
footprints belong to paul. Somehow he managed to get away.
mom gets it first, then the youngest.
he hides in the master bedroom, the unsub finds him and shoots him.
and carries him out to the backyard.
but not the mother. She's dragged out.
it's quick and proficient.
for the mother and the boys, maybe.
but lucy's drowned and not shot.
why the change in M. O?
f-22 raptor. - Yeah.
it's about to get way louder and much busier.
tomorrow is langley's 50th anniversary air show.
the father of the first family killed--dan williams, where is he now?
he put in for another tour of iraq.
an I. E.D. killed him 2 months ago.
whoever did this knew both fathers were serving overseas.
Laura downey's wedding rings are missing. Any other valuables?
we'll have to ask the husband.
from the williams home, only jewelry and watches were missing.
the unsub only took what he can carry, which means he's most likely on foot.
there was a photo on the wall in the kitchen.
I'd like to see it. - Sure.
there's no sign of sexual assault in the williams case. What about lucy?
nothing on the coroner's report.
multiple suspects?
the mother was dragged out of the house.
if it had been multiple suspects, they probably would have carried her.
he knew the father was absent, therefore the dominant threat was absent.
so we could be looking for a single suspect.
no sign of forced entry. - No need.
Lucy was in the pool, back door was open. The unsub walked right in.
that means lucy probably died last.
in both cases the girls were suffocated and not shot.
I don't think it's a coincidence.
Hey, garcia. You're on speaker.
we just got a call from virginia super max prison.
one of the inmates there has received 2 envelopes in the last 2 days.
first envelope had clippings of the newport news killings.
second envelope had media clippings of the downey family.
in the second envelope was a note saying, "look at what I've done,
and both pieces of mail have been signed by "an admirer.
who's the inmate?
that's the part that...
Karl arnold. - The fox?
he's back. - Ok, thanks.
family annihilator, absent father, wedding rings. It's similar.
to what?
4 years ago, karl arnold, aka the fox, killed 8 families.
just like this case, he took wedding rings, only he took them as trophies.
he'd hide in the bushes outside the homes.
and I watched them... For a number of days.
always at night.
saw how they lived...
how they loved.
I would keep them apart until the last night.
then I would bring them, one by one, down to the basement, the youngest first.
the father last. - Why, karl?
so he could see what happens...
to families when the head of household isn't strong.
wives wither... Children perish.
so, we're working with a copycat here?
it's too early to assume anything. - It could bias the profile.
not to mention the police, the media, and the military would jump all over it.
until we're positive, none of this information leaves the 7 of us.
Hotch, you gave evidence at arnold's trial.
I think you should go see him.
I'd like to take prentiss with me. - Let's go.
have garcia check on all of arnold's prison correspondence and visitors for the last 4 years.
OK. Captain joseph downey has arrived back at the station.
captain downey, please, sit. - Thank you, I'm fine.
tell me everything.
at around 9: 30 3 nights ago, your neighbors called police when...
I'm sorry.
sir. We believe it was the work of a serial killer.
I'm sorry. My neighbors, uh, jack and penny
captain downey... Your family was murdered. All of them.
is there someone you'd like us to call?
uh, call, um--no, no. I, uh...
I--I'd like to go home now.
captain downey. Captain downey. Captain d-- Ok. Ok. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
so why wait a year to send karl a note, unless they were communicating the whole time?
that's the first thing we need to find out.
but karl has a big ego.
he's gonna want to answer a question with a question.
why I'm not wearing my wedding ring.
and then he will turn his attention to you.
so that's why you brought me along.
your presence will throw him off guard.
then he's gonna want to describe to you in graphic detail every sexual act he committed with the families.
to freak me out?
to pull you into his fantasy.
control, open on 16.
go ahead. Keep your eyes forward.
more than anything, he's going to want to see the images of the children.
we can't give him that.
we have to give him something or we'll get nothing from him.
come on!
isn't that, uh-- - Garrett pain. That's reinforced glass.
easy for you to say. He tore apart 14 women.
open on 15.
whoa, baby!
Hello, karl.
agent hotchner.
I wasn't informed you were bring in a, uh...
they just said two agents.
this is agent-- - Emily...
I know all about you.
if this unsub's copying the fox, then we profile him like the fox.
Karl arnold worked as a psychologist's assistant, right?
Yeah. Which made it easy for him to watch, target, and learn about the victims from a distance.
Yeah, it also made him hard to find.
like the fox, our man here found a way to hide in plain sight.
but he's pulling from 2 completely different units.
williams a medic, downey an army captain.
someone knew of that military connection.
both families were attacked within a month of the fathers being deployed.
gave them time to settle in, get comfortable that the fathers weren't there.
and once inside the home, the fox would live with the families and then become the father.
but not this unsub.
he just walked in and dispensed with the family.
living with them wasn't part of the fantasy.
agent rossi. The picture you requested.
thanks to you, we pulled some prints off it.
and all the prints were on lucy.
the bullet hit the father dead center.
the prints match that of the newport news killings. It's the same killer.
family annihilators like the fox, they start with one victim.
and once they feel capable, they move on to a second victim.
they don't start with entire families.
there are more victims. We just haven't found them yet.
Karl, it appears you have a fan.
admirer. Not a fan. Big difference. Right?
is this the first time you've been contacted by your admirer?
I have many fans.
even my own website. Don't you?
you'd be astounded at some of the questions they ask.
I make a log of all of them. Would you like to read some?
I would love to. - You'd love to?
Yes. Here. Look.
maybe later.
your admirer is taking wedding rings, just like you.
but maybe not for the same reason.
like how you took all of mine.
you took mine.
but I see... You lost yours.
8 rings, 4 families.
or was it one ring for each family?
how'd you come to lose your ring?
wait, don't tell me. A casualty of the job.
my job is what put you in here. - True.
but then, it's the children who suffer most. Wouldn't you agree?
you'd know more about that than me.
which is why you came to me.
I can help you with that, agent hotchner. I certainly can.
but i'll need to see those photos.
may i?
a word? - Is there a problem, emily?
there's no problem, karl.
we cannot show him these.
these images will be his undoing and our way in.
but they're not just images. - That's exactly what they are.
we can't use lucy like that.
it's a tradeoff we have to make.
so, we are using a dead 12-year-old girl in a bathing suit as a bargaining chip?
for what?
to him it's not just a photograph.
it's much, much more, and we need to know what.
look, I'm... I've never done this before.
and you don't have to now.
Yes, I do.
all right. When I feel he's ready to talk, i'll leave the room.
you get him talking.
whatever he does, whatever you feel, just stay on script.
we need to know why he killed those families.
he's had a smattering of visits, a couple of whack jobs contact him, but nothing as direct as this admirer person.
how are we doing on the prints on the picture?
I'm still running them.
how are you holding up?
military families, they always fear the worst.
they know their men may not return, but this-- to see a father lose so much.
I wish I had something for you.
I truly cannot find a damn thing that connects these families.
geographically, both of them are thousands of miles away from their family.
communication's all they had-- emails, phone calls, letters.
but that's military communication.
even between families, it requires a kind of juice I'm not allowed to use.
come on. You hacked into the fbi database.
and they gave me a job. And I like my job. And I like my life.
all right, i'll make some inquiries. - Ok. Do that.
take care. - Bye.
so lucy dies last, alone.
this by itself doesn't really mean anything, but when we look again at the williams file, we notice that the majority of the foreign fingerprints came from karen williams' room, which means the unsub spent most of his time in there with karen.
then he must have separated her from the rest of the family.
Lucy downey was already in the pool.
that much was done for the unsub.
then this unsub is driven by some other kind of compulsion, some other need.
Hotch was right. This isn't a coincidence. It's a possible signature.
sir, I know that, but two families have died.
no, I realize this breaks protocol, but
no, all we want is to stop this from happening again.
sir, I promise you, agent garcia is the best we have. Ok. Thank you.
we need to look at each of the victims as a hub, with lives outside of their own families.
well, each one of them has their own connections outside the family.
school, friends, tutors, business colleagues.
and each one of these people are considered access points back to the family.
that could take weeks. - Well, you have time.
from remorse to the desire to kill again the unsub will go through a gamut of emotions.
it could be another year before the unsub feels the desire to kill again.
as horrific as these crimes are, this city doesn't have the resources to commit that amount of time.
we have full access to all military records for the fathers.
well, now at least we have access to the main hub between families.
the dads.
all right, well, let's find out what connects them.
stand up.
you want to see, don't you? - Very much.
we're gonna show you.
this is the home of the downey family. There were 3 children.
how old are the children?
12, 9,and 4. A girl and two boys.
where were they found?
over there.
buried. Interesting.
Laura, the mother, and the two boys were killed in the house.
the daughter?
this is where the mother and the youngest son were killed.
the other boy was shot in the bedroom closet.
Where's the father? - Overseas.
the killer knows this.
he knows everything about this family, and he watches their every move to be sure he achieves what he needs.
you have no idea how he knows the father is gone or how he targets these families, and the how.
that's the key.
the how... Is why he...
was able to catch me.
you watched the families for days.
weeks. I got to know them.
but not your guy. He doesn't need weeks. If he did, he'd stay longer.
Why?
so he can enjoy them.
but what I don't understand
is why he didn't separate the children.
exactly. That way you have more control. No room for error.
why he didn't put the boys in separate rooms and say, if you cry...
I'll have to kill mommy.
tell me...
how did the girl die?
she was drowned.
yet the others were shot.
may I see her?
what's so special about the girl?
to suffocate her.
to feel the life leave her body means everything to the man who did this.
to you, maybe, but not to this killer. Not in the same way.
all I did was show them how weak fathers could be. That's all.
every child you killed you abused physically.
for this man, there is no sexual gratification.
at least I spared the fathers the grief of living.
please... Please don't do this.
come on. Let's get you cleaned up.
Dani! Didn't I tell you to always lock the door!
Nick, cleats off! Dani! Where are you?
mom?
please don't-- please...
mom...
the girl was suffocated, not shot, right?
Yes.
just like the other two.
her name is dani. She's 14.
and the father? - Afghanistan.
does this rule out remorse? - Yes, it does.
so what is it now?
the escalation between kills indicates a major psychological break.
how is it escalated?
the timeframe between kills has gone from a year to just 3 days.
for the unsub, something has dramatically changed.
some kind of major external stressor forced this unsub into feeling the need to kill again without any remorse.
mirror neurons and stressors relating to the unsub's past may have triggered this, the strongest of which is smell.
that sound.
the williams were killed a year ago.
were there any military maneuvers going on at langley at that time?
the annual air show, but nothing as big as this.
he's killed again, hasn't he?
luckily for me.
Luckily? - Now we're alone.
you stated that the families don't know the killer. Why?
now we wait, right? You and i, see if my... Admirer contacts me.
he will.
yours was one of the first cases I studied. - Really?
I've been fascinated ever since.
with what? - You.
and now...
you want to know what I did...
to the children. Don't you?
Yes.
I can show you.
I can show you exactly what I did to them.
tell me.
children are so precious.
so clean.
but they need guidance. Especially the girls.
Why?
girls have much more to lose... Than boys.
it's a fact the female body can handle pain much better.
what did you do to them?
I showed them what men...
their fathers and brothers... Are capable of.
and what is that?
you sure you want to know? - Yes.
Morgan, if the langley air show is the stressor, then karl's admirer doesn't fit the profile.
a psychopath suffering a major psychological break doesn't brag about it, hotch.
there was nothing you could have done that would have saved that family today.
well, that's if I'm right about the profile.
I think you are.
Karl's admirer doesn't have anything to do with these killings.
well, either way, we need to know who is.
Hotch, I want you to stay with him and find out so we can stop this son of a bitch.
I plan to.
once I killed the children, it always amazed me how little...
the father fought the inevitable.
which was what? - Dying.
I'm trolling tough the williams' emails, satellite phone calls, land line phone calls, family photos, their life, all of it.
what about the downeys?
they're up next, and there's a ton to go through.
fingerprints, garcia? - Zip.
They're--they-- there's nothing here. I'm sorry, folks.
Garcia, widen the search.
Morgan, I already did. Vicap combines every database in this country.
we're as wide as we can go.
abuse can have a long-term effect on any child's brain, but for the abused child who has the high-risk gene and the orbital cortex damage, the combination is devastating.
all right, this air show is military.
these fathers are all soldiers fighting a war on foreign soil.
we know that none of these graves are a sign of remorse.
Hey, guys. Look at these graves. What are they reminiscent of?
mass graves. - Exactly.
which would indicate the unsub experienced early pubescent 3-dimentional mirror neurons reflecting events similar to the one they're creating.
I think this unsub was born into conflict.
but where was he born into conflict?
when was the last time we saw anything like mass graves in the U. S?
we haven't. Not in our lifetimes. - Not within our borders.
VICAP is national, not international.
Garcia, international databases?
Interpol is the biggest. If they did it, they're in it.
it's pretty obvious that he's done this before, but the question is where and why.
Karl, I never thought that you'd be this honest.
it takes a good woman to make an honest man.
and anyway, let's face it-- she's prettier than you.
Karl, do you know why you killed all those families?
I've already told you why.
no, you told me how, not why.
and the reasons why, in this case, are very different than they were for you.
they're very, very different.
and as you so eloquently have been pointing out to agent prentiss, all of your motivations were about sex.
motivations you learned from your father.
you really have done your research on me, emily.
I'm flattered.
you're also filled with feelings of extreme self-hatred.
it must be distracting working with someone so beautiful.
you forced those men to watch their children die, and here's why, karl.
here's why you are what you are.
what I would do to you.
by killing the fathers last, you were killing your own father, and ultimately yourself, over and over again.
this isn't over, agent hotchner.
at least not for you.
wait, hotch.
for karl, it's all about the fathers.
in this case, it's all about the girls.
they die last. They're laid out last.
none of them are shot.
none of them show any signs of sexual motive.
what if we applied that logic to these killings?
that's something we hadn't considered.
why would we? It's so rare. - What is?
the killer's a woman. - A woman?
I'll let morgan know.
Karl, just now you said that this wasn't over for me.
what did you mean by that?
he's just getting warmed up.
it's just... You don't see it.
but you will.
all right, we'll work it in right now.
Prentiss thinks the unsub might be a woman.
that's why we couldn't find a sexual motive.
wherever she's from, her father's a military man.
Derek, I've got a hit. Interpol.
2 hits. 3 hits. 3 crime scenes. 3 different cities.
the first--zagreb, 1998.
a woman and her 8-month-old baby are both killed.
and then 2 years later, the same prints show up in modena, italy, then 2007, london, england, young couple, both shot.
you were right. She's killed before.
zagreb is the capital city of croatia. - Is that significant?
between 1991 and '95 they fought a bitter battle for independence.
serbian forces tried to ethnically cleanse over 40, 000 bosnian muslims.
then at some point within the last 2 years, she moved to america.
she's on the run.
and ran right into a city filled with military families.
the only mass graves reminiscent of the ones the unsubs created were found all over bosnia after the war, but none of them rival that of srebrenica.
dutch U. N.forces created a safe haven for refugees.
then in 1995, bosnian serb forces surrounded the town.
a psychopath born in the middle of that conflict-- that's not a good mix.
she's exacting her life experiences onto the victims.
you think this woman was there? - Well, think about it.
Langley's filling up with civilians and military vehicles just like srebrenica.
can you determine her age?
based on victimology, each of these girls is no older than 15.
the balkan war lasted between '93 and '95, so if the girls represent the unsub, she's somewhere in her late 20s.
how did srebrenica end? - It was a massacre.
I don't think this woman has anything to do with karl.
I encouraged him.
I flirted with him.
made it personal.
getting intimate with a killer is... So different.
it's what we do.
Yeah. But...
there's no fixing how I feel right now, is there?
no.
but it helped the case. And you did what you had to.
agent hotchner.
before you go, there's one final thing i'd like to share with you.
let's just get this over with.
this unsub is armed and suffering a major psychological break, and she will not hesitate to kill again.
she's white and in her 20s.
we believe she came to the U. S.a few years ago.
she's likely on foot. She could be eastern european.
she may speak little to no english.
now, if you manage to apprehend or corner her, do not underestimate this woman.
she will try to fight her way out.
the downeys live less than a mile from the foresters, which means she's somewhere in this area.
I see something.
wait. Wait a minute. Could it be?
they're all connected to the same site.
every media outlet is being informed of the clear and present danger to the public.
thank you very much.
OK, guys, I really have got something.
all of these photos, every one of them, was uploaded to a user website called photobug.
Photobug? - Yeah.
members can upload photos, videos, email, webcam, chats. I use it all the time.
every one of these families extensively used this site for months, even years.
all these family photos were printed by photobug.
isn't it protected? - Not from the people who run it.
it's a great way for military families to keep in touch.
and a perfect way to target a family without anybody's knowledge.
they outsource work to people all over the country.
so I took your profile, hacked into their employee database, came up with this list of potentials, one of which is a match that screams homicidal bitch.
her name's miranda dracar, she was an orphan, born in sarajevo during 1982.
she was adopted by a family in srebrenica.
let's go.
clear. - Clear.
the foresters.
Morgan. The unsub's next victim. He's a marine.
Usmc, first battalion, engineer.
Jennifer, call your contact.
sir, I'm gonna need access to every piece of data on U. S.marine sergeant young.
it may save his family.
why are you always so slow? We're late. Come on.
I am, I am.
so you think you found my admirer. A woman.
no. We found the killer.
with my help, of course.
your admirer is exactly like everyone who contacts you--lost.
my love, your guy is far from lost.
we're done. - So is he.
look at what I have done.
it's quite brilliant, you know?
we will find whoever sent you that.
no, agent hotchner, I rather think he's already found you.
Morgan? - I'm all right. I'm all right.
I can't believe you can't see what he's doing.
what is going on?
he's torturing him. - Who?
it's great to see you squirm, agent hotchner.
he knew you'd come.
the reaper. - The boston reaper?
if you stop hunting me, i'll stop hunting them.
I don't make deals. I'm the guy Who hunts guys like you.
you'll regret this.
you should have made a deal.
are you sure that we're in danger? - Yes.
tell them i'll protect them like they're my own.
I'm not leaving the team, I'm just no longer in charge.
you are. - Me?
george foyet was the ninth victim And the only one who survived the reaper.
he inflicted those wounds on himself.
george foyet is the reaper.
one of the inmates has received 2 envelopes In the last 2 days.
I'll get this to the lab.
he's torturing him. It's great to see you squirm, agent hotchner.
get out of here. Go see if they need help downstairs.
he who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster.
and if you gaze for long into an abyss, The abyss gazes also into you.
friedrich nietzsche.
please say your name and rank for the record.
supervisory special agent jennifer jareau,
communications liaison for the behavioral analysis unit In quantico, virginia.
and how long have you been a member of the bau?
6 years. - Could you speak up, please?
sorry. 6 years.
and have you worked under agent hotchner the entire time?
no, ma'am. I currently Report to acting unit chief derek morgan.
who took over the unit because agent hotchner's Ability to lead the team had become compromised.
I--I don't believe that's the reason.
you have a different opinion?
it's not just an opinion.
you have a different understanding?
SSA hotchner voluntarily stepped down So we could continue to do our jobs unhindered.
how would you describe agent hotchner's recent behavior?
driven. - Driven.
agent jareau, your entire team is on the line
if I cannot reconcile an adequate account Of agent hotchner's investigation into george foyet.
we were all investigating the reaper.
SSA hotchner was not the only one, Especially after he sent us that calling card.
the newspaper articles he mailed to karl arnold.
2 letters from 2 different locations. They ramped us all back up again.
I should just start at the beginning.
foyet had done a lot of injury to himself In the original string of killings,
in an effort to paint himself as a victim And throw us off the investigation.
as a result, he became dependent upon A large number of extremely strong medications.
we'd been searching the country for patients With that exact prescription combination,
but we hadn't had any luck.
the envelopes foyet mailed to arnold are due back from the lab.
they're flagged urgent. - Gina's here with them now.
they're processed. Clean. No prints, no dna.
she says they're clean. - Yeah, of course they are.
Anderson, listen to me.
I don't care if you have to drive To the postmaster general's house.
I want to know where those postmarks were applied Before the team gets in.
Yes, ma'am. Copy that.
found it.
he's still not taking his bottle.
here. Let me try.
can you take your bottle, please? Can you take
thank you so much.
Oh, yeah. You are definitely mama's little boy, huh?
just like his ddy.
next.
Hey, if you have to go, go ahead.
I can take care of this.
I don't know what I would do if I were in hotch's shoes.
if I ever had to say good-bye to you and henry because
We'rnot going anywhere.
we're not. You're tracking the prescriptions, You're tracking the postmarks.
aside from another body landing on your doorstep, You're doing all you can.
I hope so, For hotch's sake.
next.
that's us.
here we are.
Oh, actually, there should be 2 prescriptions.
we filled the antibiotics, But we're out of the antihistamine.
you know, crushing half a claritin Would do the job just the same.
save you a couple bucks, too.
Wait--excuse me, Are there a lot Of over-the-counter medications
that can be substituted for prescriptions?
too many to count. Most of the time, it's just a matter of dosage.
foyet's meds--we have been tracking the entire combination.
what if he's been using over-the-counter meds For some of it to mask his purchases?
OK, narrow the search. Focus on the meds He can't substitute. Good work.
just got a call From the postmaster general inspector's office.
already? - I'm not just a pretty face.
is garcia in yet?
are you sure? Bacon doughnut. You'll never be the same.
I can totally think of more palatable ways To up my adventure quotient, thank you.
O...m...g. It gets better every time.
Kevin, you need to leave right now.
would you like some water? - No, thank you, ma'am.
are you all right?
I--I'm just not, uh, Comfortable with any of this.
it's not ok.
what do you mean?
in my opinion, Everyone is asking the wrong questions.
doesn't anybody care About what the reaper did to them, How many people he hurt?
all anyone seems to care about is...
this just isn't right.
do you think that agent hotchner was acting...
agitated or unreasonable?
he... No, no, he
he was freaked out about his family.
which, considering what happened, I'd say was perfectly reasonable.
the foyet letters came from fredericksburg, virginia, And westminster, maryland.
we can match the prescription drugs Foyet can't substitute with a geographic profile Of the 2 cities.
can't substitute?
we need you to track the drugs that can't be emulated With over-the-counter drugs and can only be dispensed By a pharmacist, and you need to do it quickly.
foyet doesn't stay in one place very long.
then kevin needs to stay. - What?
sir, kevin is an amazing analyst. I can work almost twice as fast - With him running part of my system. - Fine.
these are your screens. - Garcia, now long?
I'll know once I get into it.
we're gonna work the geographic profile. Call me when you have something.
uh, ok... - And hurry.
ok...I am gonna start with the ultram
No--you're gonna start with the ultram and naproxen. I'll work on the rest.
there's approximately 115 miles Between fredericksburg and westminster.
why mail a letter from 2 cities?
maybe it's purely a forensic countermeasure.
he knows that mailing letters close to home would lead us right to him,
so he drives far away to mail the letters to throw us off his scent.
the unabomber did that. So did the 2001 anthrax suspect.
he could have gone anywhere, but he's trolling the d. c.area.
it makes sense to stay close to hotch.
he stuck around boston to watch shaunessy deteriorate.
not that you're-- - It's all right. I know he's been watching me.
it's part of the reason I stepped down, So he'd think I was falling apart.
naproxen is available in generic brands over the counter.
Naproxen's properties can be simulated by aleve.
ultram can be substituted.
OK, oxycontin. - Jeez, he's on that, too?
Yeah, and it's highladdictive and therefore regulated, So there's no substitute for it.
I know the dea has a problem with it.
you can buy it on the streets if you know where to go.
good point. Ok, we're gonna leave that off the list for now 'cause there's another way to get it. Next up... Tapazole.
what's that? - Uh, it treats hyperthyroidism.
Hey, what's wrong with this guy, anyway?
he stabbed himself--a lot.
stabbed himself? - Yeah. So his body would have permanent internal damage
work, honey--and he'd need This prescription to regulate his heart rate,
keep down the palpitations and the tremors.
and there is no substitute for tapazole.
so if this is our missing link, how do we find him?
print out every person who's on this prescription Within a 60-mile of both cities.
the team will do the rest. I'm gonna use your laptop.
OK, so what are we gonna do about the 2 cities?
usually we need 3 different points to get an accurate geographic profile.
that's all we got right now.
gaithersburg, rockville, D. c.alexandria, Bowie, annapolis.
where the hell are you, foyet?
OK, me and the boy found a thyroid medication That has no substitute over the counter.
you've gotta get it from a pharmacist. But a lot of people are on it.
find the midpoint between the 2 cities And isolate names in a 25-mile radius.
153 names. - Well, he's not gonna use his own name.
what kind of aliases should we be looking for?
he could have easily stolen someone's identity.
no, he's a narcissist in love with his own mythology.
he'd use a name connected with the case.
a victim, maybe, a cop.
OK. Let's check the foyet files For a list of names.
and... Nothing.
wait a minute, guys. Foyet likes things to have meaning to him.
the eye of providence, The addresses in blood he wrote on the bus that led us back to him.
maybe he's doing the same thing with the alias.
like an anagram or something.
you see something, reid? - Not yet.
Reid, he named himself the reaper.
there's a peter rhea in arlington.
we found him.
once the team located George foyet's potential apartment,
why didn't the bau enter immediately?
agent rossi?
I asked you a question.
gold is still going up.
but knowing when to get out, that's the trick.
what are you doing?
what's the point of all this, erin? Why?
so this never happens again.
there is nothing a bureaucrat can do
to make sure that something like this never happens again.
so we just wait for the next bloodbath?
why did you wait so long before going to foyet's apartment?
we had to be sure he was there.
if we went in and he wasn't, He would know we found him.
of course, the longer we waited, The more time he had to...
it was an impossible decision.
so who made it? Agent hotchner?
how much longer do we wait?
I need to leave that call to someone else.
SWAT's getting antsy.
I'll tell them when it's time to go. Right now we sit tight. Let them know.
these guys are trained to move, not just sit around.
I can't really say that I blame them.
he may not even be there anymore.
I know. The longer we sit here, the further away he gets.
you make the best call you can, kid.
all right, this is what we're gonna do.
super.
I need to check your ceiling.
are you getting the signal? - Copy.
no warm bodies.
looks like kitchen table, chair.
is that a laptop on the table?
it could be useful. - Is that food?
get closer to that.
wait, go back. What's that on the floor?
it's his mail. - Yeah.
go, go, go, go!
hurry up! Let's go!
what happened?
he's not coming back here. He left an untouched meal.
you drop your mail like this when you're startled, When you need to get out of dodge quick.
something tipped him off. He knew we were coming here.
suitcases are open, some clothes are missing.
there's a safe with a stash of guns in it.
he didn't even bother to lock them up again.
if he's in a hurry, he'll make a mistake.
Yeah, but when foyet gets cornered, He starts killing.
we're not gonna let that happen.
we need to get garcia on this.
he is creepy good. - How good?
he wiped his hard drive. Might have been in a hurry to leave,
but whatever was on there, he did not want us to see it.
Garcia, tell me that you're hacked in and that you can rebuild it.
watch me work, darling.
hello. - What have you got?
he had an internet alarm on the name peter rhea.
it alerted him as soon as we ran a check on it.
what else did he wipe?
Garcia, wait a minute. Freeze it right there.
Oh, my god, isn't that
that's the u. s.marshal assigned to my family.
foyet's been watching him this whole time?
Kassmeyer. Leave a message.
Sam, it's aaron. We found foyet's location, But he has surveillance photos of you.
call me for a meet location or we're on our way to you.
we're gonna need to deploy another swat unit.
that's gonna take another half hour.
Hotch? - Go. Go.
you left for marshal kassmeyer's house immediately?
Yes, ma'am.
wouldn't this be a job for a tactical team?
we felt that it would take too much time To get authorization for another operation.
we? - All of us.
don't you mean agent hotchner wanted that?
no, i mean all of us wanted that.
I know what you're thinking, And I agree it would be easy for us to blame him.
easy?
Yeah. Why not just say it's his fault And then we can all just forget about it.
but, uh, the problem is, I have an eidetic memory, And that's not what happened.
this is agent rossi, fbi. We need an ambulance. We have a federal officer down.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't...
we're getting an ambulance. Hang on.
I tried. - Just hang on.
I'm sorry. - What are you sorry for?
I... I tried. - Are jack and haley safe?
Sam, tell me what happened.
I don't know how he got in.
where are they?
where are they?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm gonna find out... One way or another.
Sam, i need to understand.
does he know where jack and haley are?
I didn't...
this little piggy...
look at that. He's not going anywhere, is he?
what about her phone number? What's her safe phone number?
I didn't... It won't matter.
kill me. I'm not telling you anything.
you're not gonna get off that easy.
I need you alive so you can tell agent hotchner That it's his fault that his family's dead.
I--I tried, hotch.
gunshot wounds to each leg, one foot,
he's missing several fingers, and appears to be badly beaten.
clear out of the way.
get me a c-collar, prep me a saline drip While I grab a round of vitals.
Sam, are you allergic to any medication?
Hotch. - Sam, i'm right here.
I tried.
make sure they have a trauma surgeon standing by.
do you believe it was marshal kassmeyer's fault That agent hotchner's family was compromised?
absolutely not. - You answered that very quickly.
when you're being tortured, there's no end in sight, Except giving them what they want.
and kassmeyer didn't do that?
he withstood everything that foyet had.
then tell me exactly what happened.
is he conscious? - In and out.
Sam, it's aaron. Can you hear me?
Aaron. - I'm right here, sam.
his pressure's dropping. - 10cc morphine going in.
do not sedate me. I need to talk.
Sam, does foyet know where jack and haley are?
I wouldn't tell him. It doesn't matter.
let me guess.
the marshals service Doesn't have anything listed by name.
case numbers only.
the thing is, This relocation is a bit of a special favor,
which tells me that you might bring your work home with you.
who knows? Maybe even on emergency speed dial.
Hello, haley?
I'm sorry. Wrong number.
Hello, is haley there?
uh, uh, no, ma'am. I'm sorry. It must have been a wrong number.
Hello, is haley there?
Hello, haley?
Hello, is haley there?
Ohh--hal
sorry for using your real name, ma'am.
my name is victor collins. I'm with the marshals service.
ma'am, we have a problem.
marshal kassmeyer has been killed, And we're afraid your location may have been compromised.
what? - Ma'am, i need you to focus right now.
this is about saving your son. We're trying to save jack. Do you understand me?
Yes. - I'm afraid there's more, ma'am.
I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but...
your ex-husband has been killed as well.
Oh, god.
we're gonna bring you and your son in safe, But I'm gonna need your help for this, ok?
when we're through speaking, I want you to hang up the phone.
do not attempt to call anybody else. Do you understand me?
it could be intercepted. - Yes.
the next thing I need you to do Is buy a disposable cell phone.
get back in your car, call me at this number.
once I know your mobile, i'll give you another number Along with some instructions on how to proceed.
OK. - Now, ma'am, I do not want you to worry.
we're gonna bring you and jack in here safely.
are you... Are you sure aaron is...
are you sure? - Yes, ma'am.
I'm terribly sorry.
see you later.
OK.
she's going to him.
I'm so sorry, hotch.
they're ready for you.
agent prentiss. - Ma'am.
we understand that agent hotchner Managed to separate himself from the rest of the team.
he didn't "manage" to do that.
when marshal kassmeyer was in the ambulance
agent hotchner volunteered to ride along.
to get answers before he lost consciousness.
why didn't you go with him?
it didn't seem necessary. - Did you tell you that?
is that what you're looking for, A way to blame this on him?
what good could that possibly do?
agent hotchner was looking for an opportunity To separate himself from the team - and he found one. - That isn't true.
he was desperate and he didn't want someone With a clear head to stop him.
is there a question in there somewhere?
tell me what happened while agent hotchner was in the ambulance.
we contacted the u. s.marshals.
they said haley was in the wind.
she had dumped her cell phone, So there was no way to track her.
and how did agent hotchner react to that news?
foyet called haley from kassmeyer's phone.
all right, we'll get garcia to trace it. Jj.
he told her she was compromised and I was dead.
well, have you called her?
no. He said to throw her phone away and to buy a disposable.
Hotch, we're gonna come get you right now.
no, anderson's bringing me a car.
you want to meet back at the office?
I'm hoping that she's just gonna call me, at least, to check.
foyet posed as a marshal, even called from a number that haley recognized.
and then he did what gets him off. He scared her.
no, he paralyzed her. He overwhelmed her.
and now she trusts him. Where do you think he would take her?
witness protection had her living in new jersey.
he has a head start. He could be there now.
Garcia's got a trace.
he's bouncing between a few towers.
where? - Fairfax county.
he's still local?
send the coordinates to my phone. - Done.
why isn't he on his way to new jersey?
wait, that phone's on? - Yes.
Hotch? - He hung up.
damn it. What's that?
Hotch is calling foyet.
agent hotchner.
if you touch her...
be gentle, like I was with you?
what the hell took you so long?
I was beginning to think this phone was dead or something.
why so quiet? You usually lash out when you're frustrated.
I'm not frustrated.
you're more predictable than you think. - Am i?
you didn't know where haley was, So you made her come to you.
you make me sound lazy.
just another way for you to show control.
Oh, that's terrible.
you're mother tried to protect you from your father, But she wasn't strong enough.
and you hated her for that, didn't you?
you decided that all women were weak.
those are your words, not mine.
what were you, 9 when you killed them? - It was a car accident.
that you couldn't take credit for. That had to be hard for you.
but poor george got another chance.
the little orphan was saved By the wealthy, sterile eastside couple, the foyets.
and the story should have ended there.
I don't believe in fairy tales. Do you?
that's the thing, george. This isn't a fairy tale.
you don't have to write this story. You don't have to do any of this.
I know you're exhausted.
always looking over your shoulder, Always wondering when the other shoe is gonna drop.
haven't you gotten what you wanted?
you've set yourself apart from anybody we've ever dealt with.
you're not just a famous serial killer, you're the reaper.
we're gonna study you and your methods for years and years.
you know what I've been thinking?
Haley looks pretty good with dark hair.
she's lost some weight.
must be all the stress you caused her.
Where's the little man?
there he is.
does he like captain america because of you?
that's your wife. Hold, please.
Mrs. Hotchner. - I'm here.
open the gate and i'll drive in. - Ok.
Aaron? I really gotta go.
and you still didn't know where foyet was?
the phone belonged to a u. s.marshal.
it was designed to bounce between towers, So we could not pinpoint his location.
and agent hotchner was driving around aimlessly.
no. He wasn't.
we had foyet's profile, And we knew if we followed it,
we would know were he took hotch's family.
all right, foyet has to be in control. He had haley come to him.
Yeah, but where would he take her?
he'd want hotch to find him, to see where he was, to see what he did.
which means he
he said something on that call That tells hotch where to go.
Reid, what did he say, exactly?
Haley's hair looks good dark. She's lost some weight.
it must be because of all the stress you caused her. "where's the little man?
Oh, there he is now. "do you think he likes captain america because of you?
that's your wife on the other line. Hold, please.
open the gate and i'll drive in.
open the gate?
it would be someplace With the biggest emotional impact for hotch.
and haley has access to the gate.
their house, where they lived together.
of course. Foyet planned this all the way to the end. It's everything to him.
he wants to take over hotch's home To be in control to prove his dominance.
Morgan. - He's going to your house.
I know. - I'm sending out a full tactical deployment, hotch.
good. - We're on our way.
foyet's calling hotch.
Garcia, can you get us on?
foyet. - Aaron? You're ok?
I'm fine. - But...
he said that...
Oh, aaron. - He can hear us, right?
Yes. I am so sorry.
Haley, show him no weakness, No fear.
I know.
Sam told me all about him.
is he, uh-- - No, sam is fine.
is that why your marriage broke up, Because you're a liar?
don't listen to him, haley.
I have sam's service phone right here.
they sent out a mass text about his death.
you can take a look if you want.
he's trying to scare you. - Did you even tell her what this was about?
about the deal? - He's just trying to make you angry.
well, she should be. She's gonna...
D-i-e Because of your inflated ego.
ignore him, haley.
I'm sure you don't want her to know this part either.
you know, all he had to do was stop looking for me And you wouldn't be in this mess.
don't react.
what is he talking about?
tell jack I need him working the case.
what? - Tell jack I need him working the case.
Jack. Did you he that?
Hi, daddy.
Hi, buddy.
is george a bad guy?
Yes, he is.
Jack, i need you on this case with me.
do you understand? I need you to work the case with me.
OK, daddy.
Jack, hug your mom for me.
mommy hug me too tight.
I'm sorry.
why are you sad?
Oh, i just love you so much.
mommy, i gotta go. I'm working the case.
OK.
he's so cute.
he's like a little junior g-man.
I'll be right up, jackie boy!
is he gone? - Yes.
you're so strong, haley. You're stronger than I ever was.
you'll hurry, right?
I know you didn't sign on for this.
neither did you.
I'm sorry for everything.
promise me that you will tell him how we met And how you used to make me laugh.
he needs to know that you weren't always so serious, aaron.
I want him to believe in love, Because it is the most important thing.
but you need to show him.
promise me.
I promise.
and I don't know what happened after that.
after I finish you...
I'm gonna find that little bastard son of yours
and I'm gonna show him both of his dead parents,
and I'm gonna tell him that it was all your fault.
and them I'm gonna
OK. You got--you got me. I surrender.
Hotch! Hotch! He's dead. Hotch, stop.
come on, stop it. It's over. It's over.
it's ok. It's over, man.
what are you doing?
I work the case with you, dad.
Jack, i'm glad you're working the case with me.
you know I can always use your help.
I work the case daddy, just like you said.
you did a great job, buddy.
what happened to you, daddy?
I'm ok. I want you to go outside with ms. Jareau. Ok?
come here, sweetheart.
I'm so sorry, hotch.
get out of here. Go see if they need help downstairs.
there was nothing I could do for her.
she was already...
she died fairly quickly.
one of the wounds severed her aorta, And they don't think that she...
and they don't think she suffered much.
agent hotchner, what do you think would have happened
if george foyet had gotten up from that floor?
if you didn't kill him?
I don't have to think. I know he would have tried to kill my son, too.
that's good enough for me.
any questions?
agent hotchner.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
and...
if you or your son need anything...
thank you.
poet haniel long said, "so much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family "that it remains the measure of our stability
because it measures our sense of loyalty.
the reaper. - The boston reaper?
if you stop hunting me, i'll stop hunting them.
I don't make deals. I'm the guy Who hunts guys like you.
you'll regret this.
you should have made a deal.
are you sure that we're in danger? - Yes.
tell them i'll protect them like they're my own.
I'm not leaving the team, I'm just no longer in charge.
you are. - Me?
george foyet was the ninth victim And the only one who survived the reaper.
he inflicted those wounds on himself.
george foyet is the reaper.
one of the inmates has received 2 envelopes In the last 2 days.
I'll get this to the lab.
he's torturing him. It's great to see you squirm, agent hotchner.
get out of here. Go see if they need help downstairs.
he who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster.
and if you gaze for long into an abyss, The abyss gazes also into you.
friedrich nietzsche.
please say your name and rank for the record.
supervisory special agent jennifer jareau,
communications liaison for the behavioral analysis unit In quantico, virginia.
and how long have you been a member of the bau?
6 years. - Could you speak up, please?
sorry. 6 years.
and have you worked under agent hotchner the entire time?
no, ma'am. I currently Report to acting unit chief derek morgan.
who took over the unit because agent hotchner's Ability to lead the team had become compromised.
I--I don't believe that's the reason.
you have a different opinion?
it's not just an opinion.
you have a different understanding?
SSA hotchner voluntarily stepped down So we could continue to do our jobs unhindered.
how would you describe agent hotchner's recent behavior?
driven. - Driven.
agent jareau, your entire team is on the line
if I cannot reconcile an adequate account Of agent hotchner's investigation into george foyet.
we were all investigating the reaper.
SSA hotchner was not the only one, Especially after he sent us that calling card.
the newspaper articles he mailed to karl arnold.
2 letters from 2 different locations. They ramped us all back up again.
I should just start at the beginning.
foyet had done a lot of injury to himself In the original string of killings,
in an effort to paint himself as a victim And throw us off the investigation.
as a result, he became dependent upon A large number of extremely strong medications.
we'd been searching the country for patients With that exact prescription combination,
but we hadn't had any luck.
the envelopes foyet mailed to arnold are due back from the lab.
they're flagged urgent. - Gina's here with them now.
they're processed. Clean. No prints, no dna.
she says they're clean. - Yeah, of course they are.
Anderson, listen to me.
I don't care if you have to drive To the postmaster general's house.
I want to know where those postmarks were applied Before the team gets in.
Yes, ma'am. Copy that.
found it.
he's still not taking his bottle.
here. Let me try.
can you take your bottle, please? Can you take
thank you so much.
Oh, yeah. You are definitely mama's little boy, huh?
just like his ddy.
next.
Hey, if you have to go, go ahead.
I can take care of this.
I don't know what I would do if I were in hotch's shoes.
if I ever had to say good-bye to you and henry because
We'rnot going anywhere.
we're not. You're tracking the prescriptions, You're tracking the postmarks.
aside from another body landing on your doorstep, You're doing all you can.
I hope so, For hotch's sake.
next.
that's us.
here we are.
Oh, actually, there should be 2 prescriptions.
we filled the antibiotics, But we're out of the antihistamine.
you know, crushing half a claritin Would do the job just the same.
save you a couple bucks, too.
Wait--excuse me, Are there a lot Of over-the-counter medications
that can be substituted for prescriptions?
too many to count. Most of the time, it's just a matter of dosage.
foyet's meds--we have been tracking the entire combination.
what if he's been using over-the-counter meds For some of it to mask his purchases?
OK, narrow the search. Focus on the meds He can't substitute. Good work.
just got a call From the postmaster general inspector's office.
already? - I'm not just a pretty face.
is garcia in yet?
are you sure? Bacon doughnut. You'll never be the same.
I can totally think of more palatable ways To up my adventure quotient, thank you.
O...m...g. It gets better every time.
Kevin, you need to leave right now.
would you like some water? - No, thank you, ma'am.
are you all right?
I--I'm just not, uh, Comfortable with any of this.
it's not ok.
what do you mean?
in my opinion, Everyone is asking the wrong questions.
doesn't anybody care About what the reaper did to them, How many people he hurt?
all anyone seems to care about is...
this just isn't right.
do you think that agent hotchner was acting...
agitated or unreasonable?
he... No, no, he
he was freaked out about his family.
which, considering what happened, I'd say was perfectly reasonable.
the foyet letters came from fredericksburg, virginia, And westminster, maryland.
we can match the prescription drugs Foyet can't substitute with a geographic profile Of the 2 cities.
can't substitute?
we need you to track the drugs that can't be emulated With over-the-counter drugs and can only be dispensed By a pharmacist, and you need to do it quickly.
foyet doesn't stay in one place very long.
then kevin needs to stay. - What?
sir, kevin is an amazing analyst. I can work almost twice as fast - With him running part of my system. - Fine.
these are your screens. - Garcia, now long?
I'll know once I get into it.
we're gonna work the geographic profile. Call me when you have something.
uh, ok... - And hurry.
ok...I am gonna start with the ultram
No--you're gonna start with the ultram and naproxen. I'll work on the rest.
there's approximately 115 miles Between fredericksburg and westminster.
why mail a letter from 2 cities?
maybe it's purely a forensic countermeasure.
he knows that mailing letters close to home would lead us right to him,
so he drives far away to mail the letters to throw us off his scent.
the unabomber did that. So did the 2001 anthrax suspect.
he could have gone anywhere, but he's trolling the d. c.area.
it makes sense to stay close to hotch.
he stuck around boston to watch shaunessy deteriorate.
not that you're-- - It's all right. I know he's been watching me.
it's part of the reason I stepped down, So he'd think I was falling apart.
naproxen is available in generic brands over the counter.
Naproxen's properties can be simulated by aleve.
ultram can be substituted.
OK, oxycontin. - Jeez, he's on that, too?
Yeah, and it's highladdictive and therefore regulated, So there's no substitute for it.
I know the dea has a problem with it.
you can buy it on the streets if you know where to go.
good point. Ok, we're gonna leave that off the list for now 'cause there's another way to get it. Next up... Tapazole.
what's that? - Uh, it treats hyperthyroidism.
Hey, what's wrong with this guy, anyway?
he stabbed himself--a lot.
stabbed himself? - Yeah. So his body would have permanent internal damage
work, honey--and he'd need This prescription to regulate his heart rate,
keep down the palpitations and the tremors.
and there is no substitute for tapazole.
so if this is our missing link, how do we find him?
print out every person who's on this prescription Within a 60-mile of both cities.
the team will do the rest. I'm gonna use your laptop.
OK, so what are we gonna do about the 2 cities?
usually we need 3 different points to get an accurate geographic profile.
that's all we got right now.
gaithersburg, rockville, D. c.alexandria, Bowie, annapolis.
where the hell are you, foyet?
OK, me and the boy found a thyroid medication That has no substitute over the counter.
you've gotta get it from a pharmacist. But a lot of people are on it.
find the midpoint between the 2 cities And isolate names in a 25-mile radius.
153 names. - Well, he's not gonna use his own name.
what kind of aliases should we be looking for?
he could have easily stolen someone's identity.
no, he's a narcissist in love with his own mythology.
he'd use a name connected with the case.
a victim, maybe, a cop.
OK. Let's check the foyet files For a list of names.
and... Nothing.
wait a minute, guys. Foyet likes things to have meaning to him.
the eye of providence, The addresses in blood he wrote on the bus that led us back to him.
maybe he's doing the same thing with the alias.
like an anagram or something.
you see something, reid? - Not yet.
Reid, he named himself the reaper.
there's a peter rhea in arlington.
we found him.
once the team located George foyet's potential apartment,
why didn't the bau enter immediately?
agent rossi?
I asked you a question.
gold is still going up.
but knowing when to get out, that's the trick.
what are you doing?
what's the point of all this, erin? Why?
so this never happens again.
there is nothing a bureaucrat can do
to make sure that something like this never happens again.
so we just wait for the next bloodbath?
why did you wait so long before going to foyet's apartment?
we had to be sure he was there.
if we went in and he wasn't, He would know we found him.
of course, the longer we waited, The more time he had to...
it was an impossible decision.
so who made it? Agent hotchner?
how much longer do we wait?
I need to leave that call to someone else.
SWAT's getting antsy.
I'll tell them when it's time to go. Right now we sit tight. Let them know.
these guys are trained to move, not just sit around.
I can't really say that I blame them.
he may not even be there anymore.
I know. The longer we sit here, the further away he gets.
you make the best call you can, kid.
all right, this is what we're gonna do.
super.
super. There's a leak in the apartment above you.
I need to check your ceiling.
are you getting the signal? - Copy.
no warm bodies.
looks like kitchen table, chair.
is that a laptop on the table?
it could be useful. - Is that food?
get closer to that.
wait, go back. What's that on the floor?
it's his mail. - Yeah.
go, go, go, go!
hurry up! Let's go!
what happened?
he's not coming back here. He left an untouched meal.
you drop your mail like this when you're startled, When you need to get out of dodge quick.
something tipped him off. He knew we were coming here.
suitcases are open, some clothes are missing.
there's a safe with a stash of guns in it.
he didn't even bother to lock them up again.
if he's in a hurry, he'll make a mistake.
Yeah, but when foyet gets cornered, He starts killing.
we're not gonna let that happen.
we need to get garcia on this.
he is creepy good. - How good?
he wiped his hard drive. Might have been in a hurry to leave,
but whatever was on there, he did not want us to see it.
Garcia, tell me that you're hacked in and that you can rebuild it.
watch me work, darling.
hello. - What have you got?
he had an internet alarm on the name peter rhea.
it alerted him as soon as we ran a check on it.
what else did he wipe?
Garcia, wait a minute. Freeze it right there.
Oh, my god, isn't that
that's the u. s.marshal assigned to my family.
foyet's been watching him this whole time?
Kassmeyer. Leave a message.
Sam, it's aaron. We found foyet's location, But he has surveillance photos of you.
call me for a meet location or we're on our way to you.
we're gonna need to deploy another swat unit.
that's gonna take another half hour.
Hotch? - Go. Go.
you left for marshal kassmeyer's house immediately?
Yes, ma'am.
wouldn't this be a job for a tactical team?
we felt that it would take too much time To get authorization for another operation.
we? - All of us.
don't you mean agent hotchner wanted that?
no, i mean all of us wanted that.
I know what you're thinking, And I agree it would be easy for us to blame him.
easy?
Yeah. Why not just say it's his fault And then we can all just forget about it.
but, uh, the problem is, I have an eidetic memory, And that's not what happened.
this is agent rossi, fbi. We need an ambulance. We have a federal officer down.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't...
we're getting an ambulance. Hang on.
I tried. - Just hang on.
I'm sorry. - What are you sorry for?
I... I tried. - Are jack and haley safe?
Sam, tell me what happened.
I don't know how he got in.
where are they?
where are they?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm gonna find out... One way or another.
Sam, i need to understand.
does he know where jack and haley are?
I didn't...
this little piggy...
look at that. He's not going anywhere, is he?
what about her phone number? What's her safe phone number?
I didn't... It won't matter.
kill me. I'm not telling you anything.
you're not gonna get off that easy.
I need you alive so you can tell agent hotchner That it's his fault that his family's dead.
I--I tried, hotch.
gunshot wounds to each leg, one foot,
he's missing several fingers, and appears to be badly beaten.
clear out of the way.
get me a c-collar, prep me a saline drip While I grab a round of vitals.
Sam, are you allergic to any medication?
Hotch. - Sam, i'm right here.
I tried.
make sure they have a trauma surgeon standing by.
do you believe it was marshal kassmeyer's fault That agent hotchner's family was compromised?
absolutely not. - You answered that very quickly.
when you're being tortured, there's no end in sight, Except giving them what they want.
and kassmeyer didn't do that?
he withstood everything that foyet had.
then tell me exactly what happened.
is he conscious? - In and out.
Sam, it's aaron. Can you hear me?
Aaron. - I'm right here, sam.
his pressure's dropping. - 10cc morphine going in.
do not sedate me. I need to talk.
Sam, does foyet know where jack and haley are?
I wouldn't tell him. It doesn't matter.
let me guess.
the marshals service Doesn't have anything listed by name.
case numbers only.
the thing is, This relocation is a bit of a special favor,
which tells me that you might bring your work home with you.
who knows? Maybe even on emergency speed dial.
Hello, haley?
I'm sorry. Wrong number.
Hello, is haley there?
uh, uh, no, ma'am. I'm sorry. It must have been a wrong number.
Hello, is haley there?
Hello, haley?
Hello, is haley there?
sorry for using your real name, ma'am.
my name is victor collins. I'm with the marshals service.
ma'am, we have a problem.
marshal kassmeyer has been killed, And we're afraid your location may have been compromised.
what? - Ma'am, i need you to focus right now.
this is about saving your son. We're trying to save jack. Do you understand me?
Yes. - I'm afraid there's more, ma'am.
I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but...
your ex-husband has been killed as well.
Oh, god.
we're gonna bring you and your son in safe, But I'm gonna need your help for this, ok?
when we're through speaking, I want you to hang up the phone.
do not attempt to call anybody else. Do you understand me?
it could be intercepted. - Yes.
the next thing I need you to do Is buy a disposable cell phone.
get back in your car, call me at this number.
once I know your mobile, i'll give you another number Along with some instructions on how to proceed.
OK. - Now, ma'am, I do not want you to worry.
we're gonna bring you and jack in here safely.
are you... Are you sure aaron is...
are you sure? - Yes, ma'am.
I'm terribly sorry.
see you later.
OK.
she's going to him.
I'm so sorry, hotch.
they're ready for you.
agent prentiss. - Ma'am.
we understand that agent hotchner Managed to separate himself from the rest of the team.
he didn't "manage" to do that.
when marshal kassmeyer was in the ambulance
agent hotchner volunteered to ride along.
to get answers before he lost consciousness.
why didn't you go with him?
it didn't seem necessary. - Did you tell you that?
is that what you're looking for, A way to blame this on him?
what good could that possibly do?
agent hotchner was looking for an opportunity To separate himself from the team - and he found one. - That isn't true.
he was desperate and he didn't want someone With a clear head to stop him.
is there a question in there somewhere?
tell me what happened while agent hotchner was in the ambulance.
we contacted the u. s.marshals.
they said haley was in the wind.
she had dumped her cell phone, So there was no way to track her.
and how did agent hotchner react to that news?
foyet called haley from kassmeyer's phone.
all right, we'll get garcia to trace it. Jj.
he told her she was compromised and I was dead.
well, have you called her?
no. He said to throw her phone away and to buy a disposable.
Hotch, we're gonna come get you right now.
no, anderson's bringing me a car.
you want to meet back at the office?
I'm hoping that she's just gonna call me, at least, to check.
foyet posed as a marshal, even called from a number that haley recognized.
and then he did what gets him off. He scared her.
no, he paralyzed her. He overwhelmed her.
and now she trusts him. Where do you think he would take her?
witness protection had her living in new jersey.
he has a head start. He could be there now.
Garcia's got a trace.
he's bouncing between a few towers.
where? - Fairfax county.
he's still local?
send the coordinates to my phone. - Done.
why isn't he on his way to new jersey?
wait, that phone's on? - Yes.
Hotch? - He hung up.
damn it. What's that?
Hotch is calling foyet.
agent hotchner.
if you touch her...
be gentle, like I was with you?
what the hell took you so long?
I was beginning to think this phone was dead or something.
why so quiet? You usually lash out when you're frustrated.
I'm not frustrated.
you're more predictable than you think. - Am i?
you didn't know where haley was, So you made her come to you.
you make me sound lazy.
just another way for you to show control.
Oh, that's terrible.
you're mother tried to protect you from your father, But she wasn't strong enough.
and you hated her for that, didn't you?
you decided that all women were weak.
those are your words, not mine.
what were you, 9 when you killed them? - It was a car accident.
that you couldn't take credit for. That had to be hard for you.
but poor george got another chance.
the little orphan was saved By the wealthy, sterile eastside couple, the foyets.
and the story should have ended there.
I don't believe in fairy tales. Do you?
that's the thing, george. This isn't a fairy tale.
you don't have to write this story. You don't have to do any of this.
I know you're exhausted.
always looking over your shoulder, Always wondering when the other shoe is gonna drop.
haven't you gotten what you wanted?
you've set yourself apart from anybody we've ever dealt with.
you're not just a famous serial killer, you're the reaper.
we're gonna study you and your methods for years and years.
you know what I've been thinking?
Haley looks pretty good with dark hair.
she's lost some weight.
must be all the stress you caused her.
Where's the little man?
there he is.
does he like captain america because of you?
that's your wife. Hold, please.
Mrs. Hotchner. - I'm here.
open the gate and i'll drive in. - Ok.
Aaron? I really gotta go.
and you still didn't know where foyet was?
the phone belonged to a u. s.marshal.
it was designed to bounce between towers, So we could not pinpoint his location.
and agent hotchner was driving around aimlessly.
no. He wasn't.
we had foyet's profile, And we knew if we followed it,
we would know were he took hotch's family.
all right, foyet has to be in control. He had haley come to him.
Yeah, but where would he take her?
he'd want hotch to find him, to see where he was, to see what he did.
which means he
he said something on that call That tells hotch where to go.
Reid, what did he say, exactly?
Haley's hair looks good dark. She's lost some weight.
it must be because of all the stress you caused her. "where's the little man?
Oh, there he is now. "do you think he likes captain america because of you?
that's your wife on the other line. Hold, please.
open the gate and i'll drive in.
open the gate?
it would be someplace With the biggest emotional impact for hotch.
and haley has access to the gate.
their house, where they lived together.
of course. Foyet planned this all the way to the end. It's everything to him.
he wants to take over hotch's home To be in control to prove his dominance.
Morgan. - He's going to your house.
I know. - I'm sending out a full tactical deployment, hotch.
good. - We're on our way.
foyet's calling hotch.
Garcia, can you get us on?
foyet. - Aaron? You're ok?
I'm fine. - But...
he said that...
Oh, aaron. - He can hear us, right?
Yes. I am so sorry.
Haley, show him no weakness, No fear.
I know.
Sam told me all about him.
is he, uh-- - No, sam is fine.
is that why your marriage broke up, Because you're a liar?
don't listen to him, haley.
I have sam's service phone right here.
they sent out a mass text about his death.
you can take a look if you want.
he's trying to scare you. - Did you even tell her what this was about?
about the deal? - He's just trying to make you angry.
well, she should be. She's gonna...
D-i-e Because of your inflated ego.
ignore him, haley.
I'm sure you don't want her to know this part either.
you know, all he had to do was stop looking for me And you wouldn't be in this mess.
don't react.
what is he talking about?
tell jack I need him working the case.
what? - Tell jack I need him working the case.
Jack. Did you he that?
Hi, daddy.
Hi, buddy.
is george a bad guy?
Yes, he is.
Jack, i need you on this case with me.
do you understand? I need you to work the case with me.
OK, daddy.
Jack, hug your mom for me.
mommy hug me too tight.
I'm sorry.
why are you sad?
Oh, i just love you so much.
mommy, i gotta go. I'm working the case.
OK.
he's so cute.
he's like a little junior g-man.
I'll be right up, jackie boy!
is he gone? - Yes.
you're so strong, haley. You're stronger than I ever was.
you'll hurry, right?
I know you didn't sign on for this.
neither did you.
I'm sorry for everything.
promise me that you will tell him how we met And how you used to make me laugh.
he needs to know that you weren't always so serious, aaron.
I want him to believe in love, Because it is the most important thing.
but you need to show him.
promise me.
I promise.
and I don't know what happened after that.
after I finish you...
I'm gonna find that little bastard son of yours
and I'm gonna show him both of his dead parents,
and I'm gonna tell him that it was all your fault.
and them I'm gonna
OK. You got--you got me. I surrender.
Hotch! Hotch! He's dead. Hotch, stop.
come on, stop it. It's over. It's over.
it's ok. It's over, man.
what are you doing?
I work the case with you, dad.
Jack, i'm glad you're working the case with me.
you know I can always use your help.
I work the case daddy, just like you said.
you did a great job, buddy.
what happened to you, daddy?
I'm ok. I want you to go outside with ms. Jareau. Ok?
come here, sweetheart.
I'm so sorry, hotch.
get out of here. Go see if they need help downstairs.
there was nothing I could do for her.
she was already...
she died fairly quickly.
one of the wounds severed her aorta, And they don't think that she...
and they don't think she suffered much.
agent hotchner, what do you think would have happened
if george foyet had gotten up from that floor?
if you didn't kill him?
I don't have to think. I know he would have tried to kill my son, too.
that's good enough for me.
any questions?
agent hotchner.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
and...
if you or your son need anything...
thank you.
poet haniel long said, "so much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family "that it remains the measure of our stability
because it measures our sense of loyalty.
W.S.Gilbert wrote, "it's love that makes the world go 'round."
and if that's true, then the world spun a little faster with haley in it.
Haley was my best friend since we were in high school.
we certainly had our struggles, but if there's one thing we agreed on unconditionally,
it was our love and commitment to our son Jack.
Haley's love for Jack was joyous and fierce.
that fierceness is why she isn't here today.
a mother's love is an unrivaled force of nature.
and we can all learn much from the way haley lived her life.
Haley's death causes each of us to stop and take stock of our lives.
to measure who we are and what we've become.
I don't have all those answers for myself, but I know who Haley was.
she was the woman who died protecting the child we brought into this world together.
and I will make sure that Jack grows up knowing who his mother was
and how she loved and protected him and how much I loved her.
if Haley were with us today, she would ask us not to mourn her death but to celebrate her life.
she would tell us...
she would tell us to love our families unconditionally...
and to hold them close, because in the end, they are all that matter.
I met Haley at the tryouts of our high school's production of "the pirates of penzance."
I found our copy of the play and was looking through it the other night,
and I came upon a passage that seemed...
appropriate for this moment.
"Oh, dry the glistening tear "that dews that martial cheek.
thy loving children hear, in them thy comfort seek.
with sympathetic care "their arms around thee creep, for, oh, they cannot bear to see their father weep."
OK, you can go ahead.
blow mommy a kiss.
if there's anything I can do... - Thank you.
I'm so sorry for your loss. - Thank you, Gina. Thank you for coming.
I think you could use some air.
Jack's ok. I saw him with his cousins. - Ok.
Jessica, would you make sure that jack gets something to eat?
sure. - And I'll be right back. Thanks.
what do we do?
there's nothing we can do. We just gotta wait him out.
you think he'll ever come back?
would you? - He'll come back.
I just don't know what he's gonna look like when he does.
we just need to be there for him when he's ready.
you know, I broke my promise to Haley.
what promise?
I told her that I would catch Foyet and that I'd...
spend the rest of my life making it up to her.
you still can. You saved Jack.
you know, I may have the tools to do this job,
but I don't know if I have the tools to help my son.
you have to ask yourself what kind of father you want to be.
and when you figure that out...
then you'll know what to do.
I meant what I said today. Things have changed.
and I need to do what's best for Jack.
you will.
they can't be calling us in, not tonight.
I'm on it.
we can't go.
we have to. I'll get Rossi.
talk to Strauss, tell her to send another team.
there's no other team available.
nashville's calling us in.
second body in 2 weeks, both killed on consecutive Friday nights.
they realize they're up against the clock and they're hoping we might find something they didn't.
guys. I'm sorry, but we just got called in.
we have to go. - Call me if you need anything.
take care of your son. - Thanks.
you gonna be ok?
I'll see you when you get back.
Oliver. Wendell. Holmes.
two women dead in two weeks, both killed in their own homes, and no sign of forced entry.
floors were covered in rose petals.
quite the romantic. Evidence of sexual assault?
none. Both women were last seen leaving their offices on a friday and never showed up to work on a monday.
it's Thursday. Why are we only being called in now?
the second body was only found yesterday.
there may be a socio-economic pattern emerging.
the first victim, Bethany Heminger, lived in Belle Meade, Melissa Johnson in Brentwood.
both are affluent neighborhoods.
yet there was nothing missing from either home.
what did these women do for a living?
Bethany was a defense attorney, Melissa a corporate executive.
two brunettes with similar features in high-powered professions?
that's not a coincidence.
these women most likely represent someone he knows.
all right, so we need to figure out where this unsub is meeting his victims
and how he's gaining access to their homes.
and if he's staying on pattern, most likely this guy has picked out his next target.
we should check gardeners, housekeeping staff, pool attendants,
floral shops, see if anyone worked both homes.
start working up a paper trail, Garcia.
find out where these women were in the days leading up to each murder.
like a genie in a bottle--poof!
all right. Prentiss, you and I are gonna go check out the Johnson crime scene.
Rossi, you and Reid talk to the coroner, start working up victimology.
JJ, talk to the families and staff and find a connection we can use.
I understand that all of our thoughts are with Hotch.
but right now, I need us all to focus on this case.
we have less than a day before this unsub will strike again.
let's finish this thing fast.
you must be the FBI. Landon Kaminski.
agent Jareau. We spoke on the phone.
Yeah, it's nice to meet you. The mayor's on my ass.
two prominent women killed on my watch and everyone knows we're bracing for a third.
well, let's hope that doesn't happen. Where would you like us to set up?
in here.
I'm gonna need to issue a statement with the press.
every woman in Nashville needs to know there's a serial killer on the loose.
we need them taking preventative measures to avoid becoming his next target.
the mayor thinks we should be as specific as possible.
every woman, detective.
his first 2 victims may be from the same social class,
but if we isolate victimology this soon,
it may cause him to go outside of his own comfort zone,
and then he'll be even harder to track.
better to stress hypervigilance and shut down his victim pool completely, don't you think?
Yes, ma'am.
well, the house has a security system,
but her friends say that she only used it when she traveled out of town.
he killed the dog, hid it in a storage container in the garage.
she probably thought he was protection enough.
that was her first mistake.
she had all the precautions to avoid home invasion, she just didn't use them properly.
these are the prints that match the other crime scene.
it looks like he didn't hesitate to get them everywhere.
which typically would indicate that he's disorganized.
this crime scene screams of organization.
the roses, the dog.
he was a stranger to these women.
he didn't talk his way in, he was laying in wait.
and he knew his prints wouldn't show up in the system.
he had no priors, which means he was smart and most likely educated.
this guy knew exactly what he was doing and he made sure he had enough time to do it.
so, he knew when she'd leave the house and when she'd return.
he's stalking them.
it's only the victim's prints on the exterior doorknobs.
nothing on the windows, the garage wasn't forced.
so how did he get in?
defensive wounds on both women.
more so on the latest victim.
she fought back the hardest.
no ligature marks. They weren't bound.
so how does he keep them from running out?
maybe he blocked the escape route, or maybe the threat of a knife was enough.
I might be able to answer that.
the stab wounds weren't the only injuries. - What do you mean?
Melissa Johnson had a concussion.
Bethany Heminger, a broken rib.
Annitial assault to prove his domince, make sure they're too scared to try and escape.
something else you should see.
both their stomach contents were the same.
chicken, broccoli, pasta, salad, and red wine.
he's playing out a fantasy.
one he has to control.
he sets the scene with flower petals and wine and then he cooks for them.
their last supper.
so he cooked, and he cleaned up after himself.
why did he leave the petal trail?
it's gotta mean something our guy.
he's not just reliving a fantasy, he's repeating it.
it's the same routine, the same meal.
it's not just routine, it's proper etiquette.
what? - Take a look at this.
there's a handprint in the center back of this chair right here.
he pulled this chair out for himself.
over here, there are handprints on either side of the chair.
he pulled this chair out for her, poured her wine...
and even cleaned up after the meal was done.
but up here something changed. - Then he drew her a bath.
and this is where Messa Johnson was murdered.
this is where the fantasy ended.
because she broke it?
I would. - What do you mean?
well, after the initial assult downstairs, fine, I'm scared,
but I'm still looking for another chance to escape.
dinner, wine, dishes.
I'm not in any immediate danger, so I can take my time, wait for the right moment.
I do what he says because I don't want him to hurt me again.
but once he gets me in here, I am at my most vulnerable.
so fear takes over and she fights back.
because if she doesn't...
home is where you're supposed to feel safe.
nobody deserves to have that taken away.
all right, right in there!
Hey, buddy, it time for pjs.
can I watch one more time?
I'm waiting for mommy.
all right, ready to make a wish. Ok.
nice job! Ok. Happy birthday. Say, " hi, daddy."
Hi, daddy.
let's give him a big kiss. - I miss her, too.
can I sleep in your room again?
sure.
OK, come on.
find anything?
several people had access to each home.
housekeeper, gardener, pool cleaner, dog walker, each with their own key and an alibio match.
any cross-over? - None.
we even vetted delivery people and utility workers.
Garcia, do you have anything?
there's no hits on the prints at all,
but I did what sir Derek there asked and I created a paper trail.
there's no cross over between the two victims themlves in the wee leading up to their murders, - But they did run in similar circles. - How do you mean?
they both have country club memberships, though to different clubs.
they went to upscale restaurants, private concert venues, posh hotels.
they enjoyed a high-class, highfalutin lifestyle, an expensive one.
a lifestyle he'd fit right into.
this guy is educated, intelligent, proper.
he's a downright gentleman.
the rose petals sent a pretty specific message.
he's romancing them whether they want it or not.
he's got the social skills to back it up.
Hey, Garcia, take a look at dating services and social networking sites.
look for working professionals and privileged lites.
check, check, and checkers. Back in a smidge.
we need more.
have we figured out how he's getting into these homes?
no sign of forced entry anywhere.
yet he's still gaining access to their homes long before the victims ever get home from work.
I mean, this guy needs time to cook and set up his scene.
he's either got a key or he can move through walls.
we need fresh eyes.
all right, listen up. I want everybody to go back to the hotel and try to get some rest.
we're gonna have to pick this up again in the morning.
we're giving up? - No. We're gonna take a break.
we have to give the profile at morning roll and none of us has slept since the funeral.
once Garcia can get us a paper trail, then we can expand our canvass.
untill then there's really not a lot we can do.
would you please turn the music off?
but it's your favourite song.
how do you know that?
it's the most played song on your ipod.
No! No!
stop it.
you're ruining it.
I'm sorry. I won't do it again. Ease.
I'll do whever you want.
I've put a lot of time and effort into making this a special night.
is it too much to ask for a little appreciation?
I'm sorry. I won't do it again. Please.
I'll do whatever you want.
that's ok. I forgive you.
a little misunderstanding, right?
Yes. That's right.
I'll just forget all about this.
Yes, please.
now...
I think it's time for your bath.
OK, Jack, listen, I want you to figure out where you want to put all your toys, ok?
OK, daddy. - Alright, sweet boy.
chief Strauss, I appreciate your coming to me.
Oh, of course. This isn't a time for you to be away from your son.
come in.
Jack, can you say llo to chief strauss?
Hi, Jack.
have a seat.
so, how are you holding up?
I'm ok. - And how's Jack?
he's coping. I don't think he fully understands everything that's going on.
Oh, right, well, how could he?
knick knack...
you said that there was something you wanted to discuss with me?
Yes, I do.
this is retirement.
I've talked with the director.
given the circumstances, there's no reason you should have to return to the bureau.
we can offer you full pension and benefits.
are you saying that you want me to leave the BAU?
well, obviously that's your choice, but I'm offering you a way out.
agent Moan's promotion was temporary, but he's exceeded our expectations,
and I'm confident that I could make it permanent, if you decide to step down.
the team would be together and you could be with your son.
and when would you like a decision?
I thought I would be leaving with one.
what's your hesitation?
I would just like to weigh all of my options.
whatever you need.
we believe our unsub is already with his next victim.
if he matches pattern, she'll be a successful woman,
probably brunette, early 30s to mid-40s.
she'll be at home in Nashville's upper echelon.
this means that he fits in.
Herives the right car, he wears the right clothes, he's highly intelligent.
he probably comes from a place of status.
this guy's sociable, and he's endearing.
you would never suspect that this man is capable of murder.
but he will do whatever it takes to protect the fantasy that he's trying to relive.
it's this fantasy which fuels his drive.
he's recreating a romantic evening and repeating it with each of his victims.
he most likely recently had a relationship taken away from him.
so look at men who have lost loved ones or have gone through a messy divorce.
but like Bundy, these women are representations of that first loss.
Bundy picked victims who had similar features to the woman that abandoned him,
and we believe that our unsub is doing the exact same thing.
these women were confident, successful, and strong, and they fought back.
which means he has the ability to overpower them fairly easily.
he believes or fantasizes he's in a relationship with these woman.
no matter how fleeting the initial interaction is, it's everything to him.
an invitation.
our technical analyst has compiled a list of locations that the victims visited prior to their death.
these are high-class establishments.
we're going to want to visit the same places.
so, look for men who fit the profile, but also women who match victimology.
if somebody's been paying a little too much attention to them, talk to them.
get a read, then jot their name down so that we can check them out.
all right, folks, pick up your canvassing assignments and get to work.
thank you.
the rain's supposed to clear up today.
it's gonna be in the high 50s.
what do you want to do today?
there are a lot of good movies playing at the Green Hills mall.
you want to go see something?
why don't we stay inside today?
maybe watch a dvd.
I want to go on a real date, Joe.
I thought...
after we made love last night, you'd realize how much you mean to me.
don't you trust me, Joe?
who's that? - I have no idea.
Erika? Honey, it's me! You home?
got a surprise for me, baby?
grant, help!
why do you have a key?
run!
get upstairs! Go, go, go, go, go!
No! Grant! No! Grant! No!
Hey, Erika, sweetie...
why did he have a key?
why did he have a key?
house belongs to an Erika Silverman, project director in an international design firm.
we're assuming the male victim is her boyfriend Grant Franklin.
male victim? - They're both pretty beat up.
we'll need dental records for a positive i. d.
who called it in? - UPS guy.
needed her to sign for a package, the door was wide open. We got him out back.
JJ, talk to him.
Where's Erika Silverman's body?
he changed his m. O.
multiple stab wounds to the face and neck.
classic overkill.
and evidence that she had sex before she died.
forced or consensual?
no evidence of sexual assault.
she played along.
she had sex with the unsub because she thought it would keep her alive.
so why didn't it?
this kill is personal, angry.
she didn't give him everything that he wanted.
what else does he want?
the dinner dishes are washed, but the breakfast plates aren't.
he didn't clean up this time.
the boyfriend must have surprised him and disrupted his routine.
I don't know, I'd say he came pretty close to finishing it.
it looks like they watched a movie, had an early breakfast.
she was with him all night.
Hey, Garcia. - Bad news, buttercup.
great. What is it?
no payoff on the social networng sites, and this Erika Silverman person does not leave a breadcrumb-like trail.
aside from a couple of online purchases and some automatic debits, she hasn't used her credit card all week.
all right. Thanks.
Hey,so, Garcia couldn't find anything about Erika Silverman's whereabouts over the past week.
no stores, no restaurants, nothing.
there may actually be another way to figure out where she's been.
do we know where any of the victims' cars are?
as far as I know, they're in impound.
we need access to all 4 of them. - 4?
we should also get Grant Franklin's car.
he may have driven Erika somewhere where she met the unsub.
there has to be something in the victimology.
if Grant Franklin hadn't come home when he did, Erika would probably still be alive.
so how did the unsub miss him?
it says he was out of town last week visiting family in Iindianapolis.
still, the violence of those kills indicates he knew both victims.
cause the longer victims are with the killer, the more desperate the attack.
the unsub stabbed Erika Silverman 17 times in the face, Grant Franklin 34 times to the face and genitals.
it makes sense. The more he perfects his routine, he more invested he becomes.
detective Kaminski, have your men had any luck canvassing the victims' last known whereabouts?
none. I'm thinking of pulling them off for the night.
that's a mistake. - Why is that? The vic's dead.
if he sticks to the pattern, we've got another week before he strikes again.
because he's never gotten this far before.
he's desperate to play out his fantasy.
a man like this isn't gonna stick to any time table.
he's gonna try to finish this tonight.
JJ, we need you on the news. Narrow victimology.
let people know that he's out there right now.
I'm on it.
we still don't know where he's finding his victims.
but we do know that Erika Silverman lived in Green Hills.
that's 3 points and we finally have our geographical comfort zone.
it's a good bet the unsub lis somewhere in this area,
and Erika is our key to figuring out where they met.
Oh, man, pancakes for dinner. Is there anything better?
no, there's not.
Hey, Jack, who are these guys?
this is you, and this is the bad guy. They're fighting.
who wins, Jack?
daddy. No one beats daddy.
Hey, Jack. Aunt Jessica's almost got dinner ready.
I forgot, what do we do before we eat?
wash our hands. - good job. Come on.
daddy...
he built those himself. I hope it's ok.
of course.
listen, I really appreciate your coming over.
all your help and support, it's been great.
he's my nephew, and you're my family.
I'll be here as much as you want.
the bureau has offered me retirement.
what did you tell them?
you know, Jack needs me now more than ever.
that means being here full-time.
after Haley and I were apart, he didn't have very much, and that was hard,
I knew that at least he had his mom and right now he really needs his dad.
of course he does, Aaron.
we both know you and Haley didn't separate beuse you stopped loving each other.
your job just got in the way.
your team needed you, and despite this offer, I doubt that's changed.
maybe you don't need to retire.
what if I stayed with Jack when you had to be away?
Jessica, I appreciate that...
please...
it would mean a lot to me if you'd let me help you out with Jack.
for Haley.
Garcia's got something.
I'm a real genius cause this is what I did.
I took the travel logs from the GPS systems,
overlaid their routes against the geographical profile to reveal what the paper trail could not.
which was?
while Erika Silverman is the only victim who didn't visit a private club, a concert,
or go to a fancy restaurant in the days leading up to her death,
she did spend a couple of hours at Cheekwood Botanical Gardens on Tuesday.
Garcia, did either of the other victims go to the park?
no. - I don't know if it's relevant, then.
it is when her navigation system reads in a straight line.
to work, back home, to work, back home. I don't think she ever left her house.
she even had her groceries delivered.
what was she doing on Tuesday?
let's find out.
where is everybody?
well, JJ and Reid are checking on a lead, and Prentiss is recanvassing with detective Kaminski.
good. Then we can talk.
it's his team.
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
it might not come to that. - What do you mean?
Strauss offered him retirement.
he'll never accept it.
don't be so sure. This job cost him his wife.
it cost him that a long time ago.
which is why he won't let it cost him his son.
what do you think he'll do?
it doesn't matter what I think.
what matters is whether you'll be willing to step down if he comes back.
or step up if he doesn't.
I'm gonna do whatever Hotch needs me to do. He's lost enough.
Hey, Rossi. You mind coming here for second? I want to throw something at you.
we profiled that our unsub recently experienced a loss as well.
a loved one. Probably a brunette who ran in the same circles as his victim.
right.
what if love wasn't the only loss?
I mean, we assumed that because our unsub could so easily navigate our victims' upscale world
that he most likely shared the same financial resources as his victims.
because of his upbringing, his sophisticated behavior.
but that behavior is ingrained in him. It's habit.
it something he would have learned as a child, not as an adult.
if he didn't have financial independence but were still trying to keep up his social status,
he'd be hemorrhaging funds.
we've been looking at this the wrong way, Rossi.
we vetted the maids, the gardeners, the pool cleaners, anyone who had access to the houses,
but who else might go unnoticed in a privileged society?
Garcia here.
Garcia, check employee records at each of the venues the victims visited in the week prior to their death.
look for men spending beyond their means.
a guy who's racked up a lot of debt, Garcia.
look at cars, wardrobes, something that does not fit their current income level.
a scholarship-funded private school education maybe.
as you can see the park attracts a variety of patrons.
older couples, walkers, tour groups.
we'll hold an occasional wedding or concert series on our upper lawn.
did you have any events here past Tuesday?
Tuesday.
Oh, we had a corporate fund-raiser between 4: 00 and 7: 00.
that's when Erika Sierman was here.
an event up here would be a hard sell for women in heels.
well, Most of our private events hire valets to drive the cars down to the base of the park
so they don't have to hike up the hill.
who has access to your keys but goes unseen?
and your GPS.
dealerships program your home address into the navigation system before your car even leaves the lot.
he had turn by turn directions straight to her front door and the keys to get him inside.
thank you... Joe.
Culpepper Valet Company handled the fund-raiser on Tuesday, and...
the same company had contracts with the hotel lounge thanheminger frequented
and the country club Melissa Johnson was a member at.
that's our connection.
JJ, get Rossi and Prentiss to pick up the owner.
right away.
all right, baby girl, talk to me.
I need employee records and a list of venues that culpepper contracted out to this weekend.
Oh, sug, check your email. It hit your inbox 60 seconds ago.
Thanks, Penelope.
all right, Culpeer contracted out to 3 venues this weekend, 2 today.
we might be able to catch this guy in action.
unless he's already with another victim.
the man we're looking for would have been assigned to Cheekwood Park on Tuesday.
hold on, let me, uh, pull the roster.
OK, we had 6 guys at that site on that day.
he would have had very few if any disciplinary citings.
he's proper. He appears to have had a gentlemanly upbringing.
he's a romantic. He would have talked about women and love frequently.
he might have just ended a long-term relationship or lost someone close to him.
belser. Joe Belser. Him and his girl, they broke up.
when was that? - A few weeks ago. They were engaged.
do you know what happened?
he was head over heels inove with her.
and she was sleeping with the best man.
the manager said Belser picked up a shift at the Vonner street lounge.
Yeah, we're headed there right now.
OK. Swat's gonna meet us at Belser's apartment.
Garcia, did you find anything else on Belser?
OK. He attended Southern Charleston Preparatory Academy on scholarship his parents died in a boating accident 6 years ago.
belser lost his inheritance in thetock market, and since then,
he has been racking up debt faster than he can pay it off.
he was engaged to society magazine editor to Rose Smith until 6 weeks ago...
when it was called off.
and the chapel was already paid for.
so he spent his entire savings trying to live in the world of his fiancee.
she was his lifeline the society he'd grown up in.
only to have her leave him and wind up penniless.
Hey, Garcia, I don't suppose Belser's car has a lo-jack system on it, does it?
no. No such luck, boy wonder. Need potential victims' names.
we'll get back to you. - Ok.
FBI open up!
Joe Belser, FBI! If you're in there, identify yourself!
it's clear here. - Clear.
Hey, uh, I think I found the meaning of the rose petals.
look at these. - Garage door openers?
universal garage door openers.
this solves the problem of having to copy the key.
some drivers are smart enough to use a valet key,
but no one thinks to take a garage door opener with them.
that's how he got into Melissa Johnson's house.
we only found prints on the interior garage door.
we thought it was from he moved the dog into the garage.
people rarely think to lock a door that lies beyond another locked door.
Reid. He's not here.
a beautiful brunette, late 30s, early 40s.
she would have been driving a high-class SUV or Sedan.
she only buys high-end.
no? Thank you.
VIP? - definitely.
let me check the register logs.
this is a list of all of our customers who made charges in our VIP section tonight.
they have their own attendant.
15 names. Only 6 were women.
Garcia, we need you. - What cha got?
all right, 6 names used credit cards at the Vonner street lounge in the past 3 hours.
OK, I'm cross-referencing the geographical profile with financial records.
Oh, these 3 look good, and one a brunette.
her name is N.Herron. She lives at 431 Pyle street.
we got him.
sweetheart.
we are going to be happy together. - No!
don't you want this to work out?
answer me! - No!
Annie! I'm trying to make this a magical night!
No! No!
you ruined this!
FBI! Put it down!
it's ok. You're gonna be ok.
fantasy's over.
is that what you did to them, you hit them to shut them up
and then forced them to play along with your sick delusion?
I love them.
you're finally gonna meet your soul mate, Joe. Prison.
only you're not gonna be able to push him around the way you did those women.
and when he comes for you in the middle of the night,
when you're least expecting it, you do me a favor.
play along.
how is she?
she's strong. She'll make it.
but you don't survive something like that without scars.
scars remind us where we've been.
they don't have to dictate where we're going.
I had a feeling I'd find you here.
have you told her yet?
tell her what?
that you're coming back to the team.
that fighting the bad guys is who you are.
I don't have to tell her.
she already knows.
what lies behind us and at lies before us are tiny matters compared what lies within us.
Ralph. Waldo. Emerson.
Joe, what's your 20?
almost done with rounds. Just checking the carousel.
you need some backup? I'm falling asleep here.
no. But could you leave a cupful of coffee in the pot?
anyone back here?
this is private property.
I'm gonna give you 5 seconds to come on out.
funny, don.
I'm a man of simple pleasures, and that was one of them.
what are you doing back here?
switching out a timing belt. What are you doing back here?
thought I saw someone messing around.
Nah, it was just me. - It wasn't you.
turn it off. - What?
turn it off!
what?
Ed? - Go ahead.
you need to send that backup.
I see checkmate in 5. What do you see?
I see it in 3.
we've missed you out here. - Thank you. Thanks.
I, uh, i had to take a little break.
how come? - I used to play with a co-worker friend of mine.
he's probably the best mind I ever went up against.
one day, he just decided that he didn't want to play anymore.
so you gave up, too? - Just the opposite.
I attempted to play through every permutation of moves on a chessboard.
that's an infinite number of games.
it's not infinite. It's just-- it's exponentially large.
you couldn't have played through them all.
there's an average of 40 moves per chess game, and i'll tell you something
the more I played, the more I realized that every single match, every single chess game,
is really just a simple variation on the exact same theme. You know?
it's aggressive opening, patient mid-game, inevitable checkmate,
and I realized why my friend quit.
he was tired of repeating the exact same patterns and expecting a different outcome.
so you have a lifetime of chess strategy in your head and you're just sitting on it.
I still use it. I just, uh...
I apply it differently. I have to go.
it was good seeing you.
Rita stuart, 25, second victim in atlantic city.
pretty public spot for a dump site.
you know, technically, I think it would qualify more as a disposal site.
you don't leave a body on a merry-go-round out of convenience.
he took some time with her appearance, didn't he?
Yeah. Her nails were polished, her hair was cut, clothes were brand-new.
wants her to look her best when found. That's a lot of remorse.
who is victim number one? - Stacia jackson, 29.
she was found at a local playground.
a change in victimology.
what's the connection between these women?
there is none. Rita was married, stacia was single.
Rita worked at a diner, stacia was a corporate lawyer.
according to their credit cards, they never came within 10 miles of each other.
both women were taken 2 months ago?
Yeah. They lived such completely different lives,
the police didn't tie their abduction together until now.
was there any evidence of sexual assault?
there was no evidence of violence of any kind.
so how did they die?
Rita had a stroke, stacia had a brain hemorrhage.
look at this, the unsub gave them a battery of drugs-- atracurium, doxacurium.
these are neural inhibitors. They block signals from the brain to the muscles.
he put them in medical comas for 2 months.
actually, they weren't in a coma.
you'd need phenobarbital to keep them unconscious, and they didn't have that.
so, wait a minute. These victims were paralyzed but they were still conscious?
they could open their eyes, hear, probably even feel stimulation.
physical immobility but mental awareness.
this unsub wants total domination over them.
and he turns their bodies into prisons to do it.
mildred lisette norman wrote, "anything you cannot relinquish "when it has outlived its usefulness, "possesses you, "and in this materialistic age, a great many of us are possessed by our possessions.
keeping women in a conscious paralysis reads as sadism.
definitely dehumanizing, reducing them to objects.
but there's nothing else about this profile that takes us down that path.
these women were found in excellent condition.
there was no evidence of bed sores, they were well fed through an i. v.
his access to i. v.s and drugs
he almost certainly has medical training.
are we sure this is a he?
the care this unsub shows these victims, although they are dehumanized, the profile says female.
what about the postmortem posing?
that's a lot of dead weight for a woman to carry.
these women are petite. They're under 100 pounds.
all right, if we reconsider the gender of the profile, what changes?
nothing. If anything, it fits better.
men kill to fulfill a sexual compulsion. Women don't.
you see this in angel of mercy killers, like genene jones and amy archer.
they didn't care about race or hair color. It's men that do.
damn straight. Men do.
well, hello, red. Look at you. Guys.
Garcia, what did you find out about the clothing the unsub's dressing the victims in?
at first only that both garments were made from chiffon,
but with the wonder twin powers of the atlantic city police and my impeccable eye for fashion,
we have also determined that these garments fit ridiculously well.
they're super flattering to each victim's exact measurements,
kind of exactly like the unsub whipped them up herself.
maybe that's what connects the victims. - How so?
maybe she isn't just killing petite women
because they're easier to abduct and pose but because of a physical type.
she wants a body type.
sewing clothes for a specific size of woman.
please tell me she is not killing these women because she needs human models.
I mean, there's gotta be more to it than that.
there probably is.
but at least we have a start on the victimology.
Prentiss and morgan, I want you to interview the victims' families.
talk to them about lifestyle choices.
any body image issues these women may have had.
Reid, go to rita stuart's autopsy,
see if the drugs point to any specific medical training the unsub might have had.
Dave and I will go to the disposal site.
and, garcia. - Sir.
I want you to check missing persons reports for the last 2 months.
see if any abductions match what we know.
we need to find out if the unsub's already taken another victim.
agent jareau? Detective marty cotrone.
these are ssas morgan and prentiss.
were you able to contact the families? - They're already here.
did they bring the pictures we asked for?
Yeah. They were pretty confused by that.
and to be honest, so am i.
agent morgan, I don't understand.
how does what my daughter looked like have to do with the monster who killed her?
we think the unsub is looking for a physical type.
fit but petite.
this is her. This is my wife.
sure. I guess.
she went to the gym at least 3 times a week.
stacia took pride in every aspect of her appearance.
in what way?
you know, her clothes. It was her clothes. She loved to shop.
it looks like she has kind of a bohemian streak going on.
Yeah.
what were her favorite places to shop?
high-end boutiques.
expensive ones? - Certainly.
and dressed to fit. - She was tiny.
everything had to be taken in so she'd look... Her best.
would you mind writing down some of her favorite places to go?
so these are mostly consignment and thrift shops?
that's really all we could afford.
did she ever have these clothes altered?
uh, tailored to fit her better?
I never really paid attention.
would she ever have worn something like that?
would she ever wear anything like that?
no.
can you hear that? - Yeah.
she's posing her victims in a place that represents innocence and childhood.
most serial killers don't have a particularly happy childhood.
my guess is she wants them to have the fun she never got to have.
let's think about how she's doing this practically.
how's she getting them from her car to the carousel?
she's moving a body in the middle of the night.
she needs to make conditions as favorable as possible.
so she'd need a vehicle that afforded her privacy-- A van or an suv.
that's still a lot of ground to cover once she parks.
even if these women are light, she risks getting caught carrying a corpse.
if she has a medical background, what if she used a wheelchair,
something that would help her move them quickly?
and if she has a wheelchair, that means her van has a lift,
which would be helpful to unload a body.
which also means she has a handicap placard.
which would give her the closest place to park.
I'll have garcia pull all vehicles with handicap registrations. Thanks, dave.
once I have the knees bent, I can get leverage under her.
normally, an assistant helps me.
but I can do it by myself if I need to.
I'm assuming the unsub would have this training, too.
let me ask you this-- is there anything specific about it?
no, any caregiver out there can do this-- docs, nurses, orderlies.
where do you think she's getting the drugs that she's using?
do you think she could be manipulating a doctor or a pharmacist, maybe?
he'd be criminally negligent if she was.
but it is possible. I mean, doctors order things through residents, nurses forge signatures,
prescriptions fall through cracks.
that's a lot of drugs and a lot of cracks.
she keeps these women paralyzed for 2 months.
your report said both of them had hair extensions clipped in.
Yes, to hide the fact that clumps of their real hair had fallen out.
but if they were fed through i. v.s, that wasn't from malnutrition, right?
you see this a lot in bedridden patients.
loss of motor function.
especially in a young woman like this.
of course. Psychic shock. Yeah, the mental effects take a physical toll.
one last question-- in your professional opinion,
do you think the hair extensions were clipped on before or after death?
before. - And you seem pretty certain of that?
you know the old wives' tale about your hair and nails growing after death.
what's really happening is that dehydration is shrinking your skin, pulling it back.
based on where she put these extensions, they were definitely still alive.
now, we know this unsub is stuck in a rich fantasy, right?
an incredibly detailed delusion.
we don't know what the delusion is, but we know that it involves remaking these women,
and it begins the moment she has them drugged.
so she has them paralyzed and she can do whatever she wants, why is she killing them?
well, i don't think she means to.
the brain is a machine designed to respond to stimuli.
if you keep the brain awake but the body immobile, it breaks down, loses its hair.
after 2 months, it eventually strokes out.
so death isn't this unsub's goal, it's an unfortunate side effect.
exactly. - What'd you find out?
both rita stuart and stacia jackson were clothes hounds,
but because they were petite women, they had a lot of their stuff altered.
could be how our unsub is finding her victims.
she gets her hands on their measurements.
but we already exhausted tailors, alteration shops. There's no overlap.
the tailors might send specialty items out to third parties.
dig deep into extended employment records and see who they might be subcontracting to.
Garcia needs to talk to us. - Go ahead, garcia.
Hello, my pretties. I have finished my missing persons sweep.
I've got nothing on the medical vehicle, but 2 new matches on the clothes make the woman front.
Cindy admundson. She was abducted outside a thrift store, and maxine wynan was last seen at the hillridge mall.
that sounds like our girl.
any surveillance footage at the mall?
no. It was an outside parking lot. So sorry.
the new abductees-- What's their physical type?
they look pretty tiny to me. I'm gonna send you pictures.
also, if it pleases the court,
I would like to direct your attention to exhibit "a," the calendar map.
what about it?
both of these new victims were abducted one week ago,
exactly one day before the bodies of rita stuart and stacia jackson, respectively, turned up.
she doesn't let a body go until she has a replacement.
thank you so much.
excuse me. Do you need some help?
Oh, the ramp's broken.
you want me to call a tow truck?
I just need to get the chair in the van, and then I can go home.
well, we could load it. - You think?
sure. We'll put it in the back?
go on in. You pull, i'll lift. - Ok.
here we go. Do we need to lock the wheels or anything like that?
you're so pretty.
victim is mary newsome.
abducted 2 months ago.
she was found on this bench first thing this morning.
OK, well, it looks like her style. It's chiffon, and it's sewn to fit.
if she's disposed of this body, it means she's recently taken a new victim.
we'll call hotch, we'll comb through missing persons reports from the last 48 hours.
I'll pulling them. - Thank you.
what?
these aren't hair extensions.
maybe her hair was too brittle. - Maybe. I don't know.
you know what? This is a wig. Kanekalon, i think.
what's that? - Uh, synthetic hair. There's nothing special about it.
it's used in wigs all over the world. But look at this.
o are those stitches?
on her scalp.
she sewed this in.
Yeah. Wallace. I got it. Thank you.
Hey, i think we found who was taken last night.
her name is bethany wallace.
her husband says she never came home from the dry cleaners where she stopped off to pick up some clothes.
anybody at the cleaners see anything?
the employees were busy locking up.
but they did mention that they do farm out work to tailors who work from home.
good. We can match records based on who worked on bethany's clothes.
we just got the pictures of the 2 recent abductions from garcia.
line up the photos of the new victims next to the bodies they replaced.
that might help us with the timeline.
you guys see this? - Yeah.
she's matching up the victims physically one to one.
she's a collector.
we're ready to give the profile.
the unsub we're looking for is a woman.
she's a collector. It's a psychopathology similar to hoarding.
so when we say collector, we're not talking about stamps or baseball cards.
it's not what your kids, or even you, might pursue as a normal hobby.
this is an attachment to objects that's become obsessive,
by someone who is antisocial and extremely introverted.
these people attach a part of themselves to their collection.
if you try to separate them from it or take it away from them,
they will react violently, even psychotically.
they've suffered damage to their prefrontal cortex.
that's the part of the brain that regulates basic freudian fantasyreality.
they can still function, like drive a car, go to work, even do their taxes.
in fact, she excels at goal-oriented jobs, like the precision of sewing.
or the details of abduction.
but they've lost their ability to categorize the difference between living and dead, uh, belonging and loss. That has been irreparably destroyed.
so, what's she collecting, women?
actually, we think she's collecting dolls.
technically, replacing them.
we believe that she lost the originals sometime within the last 3 months,
and this is what served as her stressor.
she searched for a replacement, and when she couldn't find them,
she started abducting the closest possible surrogate.
women of different ethnicities but of similar physicality.
the drug-induced paralysis is part of the fantasy.
she puts her victims in a position where they can't talk back
so she can fetishize them like the objects she's lost.
look.
I respect your analysis, but this woman kidnapped 6 women and killed 3 of them.
and you're telling us this is about dolls?
this unsub stitched a wig onto the scalp of her latest victim.
it's a technique used to attach hair to porcelain dolls.
and keep in mind, collectors and serial killers do share certain traits.
a lot of serial killers take trophies,
attaching the same significance to them that this collector does to objects.
but this unsub's intent isn't violence.
she needs this collection to be complete so she can feel in control of her life,
probably to overcome some trauma she experienced.
she really only feels that control when the collection is complete,
which is why she's repeating an abduction pattern with living victims.
if she loses a doll, or in this case,
if she loses a woman who represents a doll, she has to replace it.
this woman works alone. We know she has medical training.
look for nurse's aides or orderlies who were fired for a lack of social graces.
she can't fake a bedside manner.
we believe she's currently working as a tailor or a seamstress,
and we're following those leads now.
but do let us know if you notice any overlap in your suspect pools.
thank you.
of course I remember ms. Jackson.
we were all sad to hear what happened.
do you ever farm out tailoring jobs, someone who might have done this?
no.
to be perfectly honest, we wouldn't even sell something so dated.
let me take a look.
where did you get this? - Why? Did you see something?
look at this lockstitch.
it's a handkerchief pattern.
you see this on silk-sewn handkerchiefs.
and it's all done by hand.
so this is her signature? This is unique to her.
I couldn't do it, not even with a machine.
if there someplace that specializes in handcrafted sewing like this?
no. I'll tell you this much, though.
she's been at it a long time.
this woman... Is an artist.
Hotch, this is bethany wallace's husband karl.
we brought him in for questioning.
do you know where my wife is?
we're searching for her, sir. - No. You have to find her in the next 24 hours.
Bethany is a diabetic.
look, agent prentiss said that the woman who took her has medical training. So...
Bethany could have a chance?
what? - She keeps her victims in a drug-induced state.
they can't communicate.
these...these drugs, will they-- - we don't know.
but we're doing everything we can.
everyone, this is sally. Be nice to her.
so, doctor, if a diabetic were given this battery of drugs to keep her paralyzed, what would the reaction be?
diabetics metabolize everything they consume differently-- Food, drinks, drugs.
it all gets broken down to blood sugar at varying rates.
most likely, this patient seized up minutes after she was medicated.
so she's already dead.
probably. Although... There is another possibility.
Bethany's condition could break down the drugs faster than the other victims.
she could regain control of her body?
every hour that she doesn't turn up is a reason for hope.
we're still running out of time.
if the drugs don't kill bethany, she's not gonna last long without insulin.
look, collectors are good, honest people.
just because you enjoy dolls doesn't make you a freak or a pedophile.
we appreciate that, sir, but the woman that we're looking for has lost her ability to control her obsession.
she's killed 3 women trying to recreate a type of doll she had as a child.
describe the line to me.
well, there's a pattern to the victims. They're in their 20s, and they're petite.
most doll lines revolve around infants.
is she dressing them like babies?
no, she's not. Their wardrobe consists of chiffon dresses, worn by one blond woman, a redhead, and a black woman.
the dresses--is she sewing them herself?
how did you know that?
it's the valois line.
local company, back in the late eighties.
probably when our unsub was prepubescent.
Yeah. They promoted feminism and multiculturalism.
strong, independent girls from different backgrounds who could still be friends.
Reid. Birth certificate to fill out.
a form to describe their lives. And a kit to sew your own clothes.
JJ said she's been at it for a while.
she's probably been sewing since she was a little kid.
wait a minute. Sir, what's this contest that they held?
that was to see who could come up with the most imaginative doll.
sew a dress. Write an essay to describe her.
if you won the contest, you'd have your doll featured in next year's line.
I assume that didn't end well, did it? - No, it did not.
it's a classic tool child psychologists use.
tell me a story with these dolls.
when the company got essays with thinly-veiled references to physical or sexual abuse,
they turned the entry forms and the dolls over to the police.
the publicity killed the line.
you said the company was local, right?
they might still have the clothes in evidence.
how are the essays going?
makes for some pretty depressing reading.
Prentiss is having a good time.
these dolls are all like little time capsules, only the eighties fashion wasn't so kind to them.
I'm surprised how many little girls knew how to make shoulder pads.
how's it going on your end?
I got a list of vendors the victims went to
tailors, seamstresses, that sort of thing.
Hey, jj, you said something about a handkerchief hem, right?
that's exactly like what she sews for her victims.
what's the name on the entry?
Samantha malcolm. - She's on my list.
wait a minute, guys. I have her essay around here somewhere. Right here.
Sally doesn't like the room with the lightning.
that can't be good.
OK, guys, i just got samantha malcolm's medical records, and...
Oh, my god, she was doomed.
like emily bronte doomed, like shakespeare doomed,
like red-shirted ensign in "star trek" doomed.
Garcia, what happened to her?
Oh, uh, sorry, uh, well, for the first 10 years, nothing,
and then she started a battery of electroshock treatments.
at 10? Who subjects a child to ect?
that would be her father, dr. Arthur malcolm.
he runs an inpatient mental health facility for troubled young people called new lives.
at first, the essay that samantha wrote raised some flags,
but her father explained that the therapy was to deal with the recent death of her mother.
after that, he started her on a serious regimen of anti-psychotic drugs,
which he weaned her off of a few years ago.
it explains her familiarity with medication.
where is she now?
uh, her father declared her incompetent, so he's still the legal guardian.
everything is in his name.
and all of her records list new lives as her residence.
she couldn't keep victims in an inpatient facility. She needs privacy.
Garcia, what about real estate holdings in her father's name?
just his own. But new lives has a bunch of outpatient and halfway houses all over town.
JJ, where does she work?
I have her placed at 3 different shops around town.
all right, let's split up and cover the shops and the facility.
I want to go to new lives. Whether or not she's there, I want to talk to the father.
there are literally hundreds of therapies to help kids through loss.
electroshock is not one of them.
take rossi.
be nice to each other. See you later.
we're leaving.
no... No.
I am very confused, gentlemen.
what does this have to do with samantha?
we need to talk to her. Is she here?
no, she's at work.
does she live here, or did you move her into one of your halfway houses?
as a matter of fact, she is in one of my houses.
well, we'll need the address.
and i'll need to know what this is about.
she might be tied to a series of abductions.
that's not possible. It's not my daughter.
is samantha on her own at this house?
there are no other patients, right?
she thought that was best, and I agreed.
Yeah, but let's face it
you're happy that she's out of your hair. - I beg your pardon?
because if you had been visiting her recently, doctor, you would know what she's been doing.
Samantha has always been troubled.
3 women are dead because of her.
she's not capable of that. - Are you certain?
I mean, the effects of electroshock, especially at that age, are permanent.
but maybe you knew that.
my wife died when samantha was 10, and she never recovered.
I tried everything. Child psychiatry, pet therapy, nothing helped.
she was cutting herself. She was in pain.
that's the end of this meeting.
Where's your daughter, doctor?
and, agent rossi, if you try to talk to her, a mentally ill woman,
without her knowing what she's doing
do you know about the women she's keeping?
and have no medical or legal counsel present, you'll have no case.
do you understand me? None.
we'll keep the police here in case samantha drops in for a visit.
let's go, reid. - Hey, a really fast question. Why are these toys here?
I use them in my therapy.
no, i understand that, but why are they way up on this shelf,
away from where any kids can actually reach them?
they're reminders of patients that I've helped.
let me ask you something. What was the name of the girl you helped with this one?
and this one? What was the name of the girl you helped with this one?
how about this one?
these girls are what, they're like 9--9 or 12 years old, i'm assuming?
my phd. Is on the effect of trauma on prepubescent girls.
I do not appreciate what you're implying.
Oh, i'm not implying anything. I'm making an inference.
an inference is an educated guess.
and based on that, I form a hypothesis.
for instance, my hypothesis here is that after you raped your daughter,
you submitted her to electroshock treatment to make sure she stayed quiet.
this is outrageous.
and then, out of guilt, you bought her toys, more specifically, you bought her a line of dolls.
because that's what serial molesters do. They give gifts.
so you continued the pattern with your other patients,
and once they left your care, you added their toys to your collection.
I'm sorry, you can't back up your story, doctor.
this is why I love my job, doctor.
because my lab, it's a jury of your peers.
my tests will be jenny larson, abigail moore, and linda krauss.
the d. a.will put them on the stand, and I'm going to personally bring these dolls in,
and we're going to watch how they react.
or you could tell us where your daughter is and we'll tell the d. a.you cooperated.
but once we walk out this door, that deal comes off the table.
2529 adams street.
you'll tell them, right? That I cooperated.
you want to know how I figured you out?
those toys. You take care of them. These ones you treasured.
but you know what? The collection's not complete.
where are they?
she's coming back.
I have to put it back in.
no, please. Please, don't. - I'm sorry.
don't leave me.
let us go.
I can't. - Samantha?
uh, my name's spencer. I'm with the fbi.
I know what your father did to you, and I want you to know that he can never, ever hurt you again.
he never touched me. He's a good father. He loves me.
I know that he probably forced you to say those things,
and he punished you if you got it wrong, sent you to the room with the lightning.
Yeah.
the dolls that your father gave you after he hurt you, what would happen to them?
he kept them in his office with the other toys.
that's where he let you play with them?
but when I moved out, I had to take my friends with me.
I couldn't leave them behind.
of course. And so you went you get them.
What--what did you find?
Yeah. He gave them to another girl, didn't he?
do you want them back?
he said I couldn't. He said they were gone for good.
he lied. He's been lying to you for a long time.
do you want to see them?
can i? - Yeah. Yeah, do you want to play with them?
clear. We need medical here.
hold on. Hold on one second. Hey, samantha? Listen.
you need to go with these men, but your friends can go with you, ok?
they won't take-- they won't take them away?
I promise no one will ever take them away again.
well done, agent reid.
Thanks.
checkmate in 12.
no way. - Let me show you.
isaac asimov wrote, "in life, unlike chess, the game continues after checkmate.
OK. I'll see what i can do. Thanks.
I'm not sure what we have here,
but i just got a call and some case files from a sheriff samuel in uinta county, wyoming.
6 nights ago, two different teens were found hanging in their bedrooms.
hanging? - Trish leake was dead when she was found.
Ryan krouse was revived on scene, but then died a few days later in the hospital.
I know we don't handle suicides.
but the previous friday, two more boys a few towns over were found hanging on the backs of their doors.
4 successful suicides in the same rural county in a week?
that's, uh, way above the national average. - I know.
these kids don't fit the pattern.
no drug or alcohol abuse, no antidepressants, no prior arrests.
these are just plain good kids who decided to hang themselves at approximately the same time on a friday night.
when someone feels trapped in what feels like a hopeless situation,
pulling the trigger or swallowing pills or hanging yourself seems like the only way out.
none of that seems to exist here.
something's really wrong. Hotch, i can feel it.
look, all these events happened on a friday.
it's wednesday. We're not on another case right now.
all right. Generate an equivocal death investigation and get everybody on the jet.
we will determine whether these are homicides or suicides.
and even if they are suicides... There's definitely something wrong here.
life is too precious. Do not destroy it.
mother teresa.
sir, it's not that i'm not glad to be coming with you, because i am.
I just don't understand the why.
one of the aspects of an equivocal death investigation
when suicide is a probability is an indirect personality assessment.
our victims are all internet generation kids.
there should be invaluable personal data on their computers to mine for the evaluation.
if they committed suicide, evidence of it will probably in their cyber world.
so i'm gonna snoop through dead kids' computers?
this plane seldom makes pleasure trips.
we've all been over the files. Let's talk about victimology.
OK. All 4 kids were decent students, from different neighboring towns
but the same school and the same county.
active in sports and community.
intact families, no mental disorders, no precipitating events.
these are just average good kids. There has to be some underlying issue.
besides relative proximity there's no obvious connection between any of them.
it seems to rule out an overt suicide pact.
the first few days leading up to a teenager's suicide are usually very telling.
their behavior is transparent.
there's a multitude of indicators.
Yeah, but the most common don't exist here.
there's no prior attempts, no period of deep depression, no withdrawal from family members,
no spontaneous proclamations of love.
spontaneous proclamations of love?
sometimes a suicidal person, in the days leading up to the act,
will just blurt out "i love you" to family, sort of like a goodbye.
we'll start with the latest two victims.
if they were suicides, let's find out what drove them to it.
hello.
Rhonda samuel. - Agent jareau. We spoke on the phone.
thanks for coming out. My county's getting pretty shook up.
I got this reporter won't stop calling.
I'm holding him off, but he's connecting the dots on the number of suicides.
should i call him back? - No, not just yet.
we need to be very careful about when we release this information.
sensationalizing these deaths may cause a domino effect with other kids.
the term is suicide contagion.
the spread of suicidal thoughts among a group of people that sometimes results in copycat acts.
it's especially prevalent in teen cases,
and studies suggest that media coverage is sometimes associated with more deaths.
is there a good place for me to set up?
we don't have much of a command center.
Oh, fret not. I got my own command center. I just need your juice.
you got it.
Hello, sir. We're with the fbi behavioral analysis unit.
she was so excited about graduating high school next year.
she couldn't wait for her sats.
was trish dating anybody? - No.
it that who she's-- - Yes.
what is it, mr. Leake?
she ran up over $100 texting last month.
and, we, um, we grounded her and we took away her cell.
not we. Me. I did that.
why didn't you tell me she had a boyfriend?
because you would have freaked out. - No, i wouldn't.
you are right now.
not because she had a boyfriend, because i may have caused
Mr. Leake, if your daughter committed suicide, it wouldn't have been because of some punishment.
it's so much more complicated than that.
if? - Excuse me?
you said "if" she committed suicide.
would you mind showing us trish's room?
Yeah. Sure. It's this way.
I knew he didn't kill himself.
he wouldn't do that to us.
I'm sorry?
uh, that's, uh, that's why you're here.
the fbi wouldn't be investigating a suicide, right?
that's not exactly true.
uh, sometimes we do what's called an equivocal death investigation to try to figure out the manner of death. It may turn out that
our investigation will try and sort it all out for you.
I'm sorry.
she certainly was accomplished.
there's nothing unusual in her diary-- No fury, no angst.
do you really have to go through all her personal stuff?
she was such a private girl.
we are terribly sorry to have to do this.
we care about trish, and we want to make sure this doesn't happen to anybody else's daughter.
Mr. And mrs. Leake, there's a form i need you both to fill out.
can you come with me?
if you need anything... - Thank you.
those poor people.
I just hope we haven't made it worse for them.
could we?
are you sure i can't get anyone something to drink?
Yes, ma'am, thank you.
well, if you change your mind...
do you think someone killed her?
ma'am... - Sharon...
why would you say "if" she committed suicide?
ma'am, i
I mean, why would she say that if she didn't think-- If she thought
why would you say that?
well, personal touches show she was comfortable here.
sat prep books, college brochures.
she's a low suicide risk if i ever saw one.
Yeah, i think it's pretty obvious trish had everything to live for.
maybe garcia will find something on the laptop that we're not seeing here.
OK.
there's no secret hiding places.
or drug paraphernalia.
is this ryan's girlfriend?
uh, shaunna. They seemed really good together.
did he ever date trish leake?
I never heard of trish leake until...
when we met her parents at the hospital, uh, friday.
seems like he got pretty good grades.
and this letter from the football coach?
uh, coach barswell wanted him to...
be in varsity next year. Quarterback.
uh, where is ryan's computer?
um, we have--we have one in the family room.
he didn't have his own?
we were worried about, uh, unsupervised online time,
so we wanted him in the middle of everyone.
I can--i can go show you.
actually, if you just get us the, uh, network ip address,
I believe our technical analyst can go over it off site.
if it helps prove that ryan didn't kill himself, you can have anything you need.
Hey, you ready to delve into trish leake's online world?
if by ready you mean extremely capable and even more reluctant.
Yeah, something like that.
how are the leakes holding out?
Oh, probably as well as can be expected. - Yeah.
they're strong people. - Good.
well, that's weird. - What?
there's nothing here. - Nothing useful?
nothing at all. Look, there's no root directory, there's no operating system.
the registry appears to be blank.
but why would she have an empty computer set up?
I did not say empty, i said appears to be blank. - Meaning?
I'm gonna need a little while.
JJ. - I know. I know.
I never should have said "if.
believe me, the last thing i want is to make things worse for these families.
look, i'm not invested in these not being suicides. I just...
want to try and keep this friday from being like the last two.
I got it! It was--it was just a basic trojan horse.
it just hid the directories, didn't erase them.
Oh, god. - What is it?
she was on a choking game site the night she died.
a what?
uh, it's a game kids play where they choke themselves to get a buzz, to get high.
they call it the good kids' high.
you get lightheaded and a sense of euphoria even though no actual drugs are involved.
it's something kids in high school play.
did ryan have a computer?
not in his room. - What about a gaming system?
Yeah, he did. - Teenagers will find a way to get online.
I have the, uh, ip address.
that will help.
bingo. Ryan was on the same site on the same night.
it wasn't suicide.
hang on, this is a text to voice icon. Let's see what happens.
come on, try it. We all do it. I dare you.
I dare you?
someone was orchestrating this, purposely getting the kids to choke themselves.
make sure you close the door.
tomorrow's the big night.
we're all gonna play the game.
there's a whole subculture around this game.
they make up names for it, they do it at parties.
but someone is daring these kids in this area to play the game.
it's a contest. And there are rules.
come on, evans high, this is the big one.
Garfield edged out casper high last week.
you gonna let them diss us?
Diss--sounds like a kid.
who else would pit schools against each other?
reckless teenage competition.
the school that logs the most high time this friday wins.
friday, tomorrow. - Get your friends on board.
practice makes the high last longer.
gotta do it alone and video it with your webcam and upload it to the site for it to count.
doing it alone requires ligatures.
he's basically encouraging them to play the deadliest form of the game with no one there to revive them.
Garcia, shut the site down.
sir, i can totally do that, but i don't think you want me to. - Why?
right now this site is our only way to track the unsub,
and if i cut into it, he will certainly know we're watching him,
in which case he'll shut it down and he'll write a simple change in code,
bring it back up in a more covert fashion.
plus there's no telling how many servers it's replicated on, anyway.
you're right. We're ready to give the profile.
we believe the unsub responsible for these deaths may be a teenager.
he's a loner. He doesn't participate in team sports or group activities.
he's withdrawn, very low self-esteem.
his only form of pure interaction is online.
he engages in activity that draws attention to himself yet isolates him from his peers.
parents and teachers should watch out for the warning signs
kids with bloodshot eyes, marks on their necks, severe headaches, disorientation.
in real life, he considers himself a loser.
in cyberspace, he can pull strings. Makes him feel powerful.
does this kid know that other kids are dying because of him?
he's choking himself and daring others to do it,
so we're most likely looking at reckless homicides here.
it you see anything that's unusual or suspicious,
just call the sheriff's department and we will try to direct you as best we can. Thank you.
well, we've told as many parents as we could.
do you think it helped?
not as much as getting through to the kids will.
two different mechanisms, strangulation and hyperventilation, create the same effect
oxygen deprivation in the brain.
Hey, kid. Not a good idea. Let me see it.
what planet is this dude from?
he doesn't want us to win the contest.
I think the more accurate statement would be, "he doesn't want us to participate in the contest at all.
this was ryan's desk, right? This is where ryan sat?
you guys remember ryan. He, uh, played football.
Took--took shaunna to prom.
I'm assuming that some of you were probably even friends with ryan.
Ryan wanted to win the contest, too, but the way ryan choked himself,
he cut off all the oxygen to his brain, which sent a distress signal to his heart, slowing it down.
then his brain, in an effort to preserve itself, shut off all non-essential bodily functions.
his arms gave out. His legs gave out.
which means he couldn't loosen the tie around his neck,
at which point panic set in, and in ryan's case, it escalated to cardiac arrest.
which means that his heart stopped.
brain damage began, and within 4 minutes, he is completely and totally brain dead.
he died scared and probably in a lot of pain and unable to stop what he thought he had complete control of.
all because he wanted to participate in what i consider to be a pretty--pretty lame game.
so, i mean, your text is actually completely accurate.
I don't want you to win the contest, because i don't want you to play the game.
you all believe this crap?
you don't?
why don't you come up here and tell us what you think.
whatever.
Hey, come here! Come here!
kid, stop!
you all right? Just relax. - Let me go!
then stop fighting. Stop fighting. - Let me go!
stop it. - Let me go.
it's all right. - You ok?
Yeah. I'm fine. Why'd you run?
Morgan, look at his neck.
let me look at your neck. - Don't touch that!
Hey, what'd i say? Relax.
different colors mean different stages of healing.
you've been doing this to yourself for a long time, haven't you?
there's no telling how much his brain has suffered.
Dr. Reid. You think it's him?
he's a pretty likely candidate.
Dr. Spire to er.
I'm wilson summers. The school called and said my son was injured.
will. - You know him?
professionally. He works for the fire department.
sheriff. - This is dr. Reid.
is my son all right, doctor?
actually, um, i'm not that type of doctor.
I'm with the fbi. - Fbi?
your son christopher has been choking himself.
I don't understand.
you know the kids that have died recently?
the suicides. - They may not be suicides.
it's a game that kids his age tend to play where they force themselves to pass out for the buzz that it gives them.
how long has christopher been dressing in the gothic fashion?
the black nails and the eyes and...
Why's that?
his mother died a few years ago, and he's been wearing black ever since.
does christopher spend a lot of time on the computer?
just every waking... Why?
we think your son may have created a website encouraging kids to compete in this choking contest.
what are you saying? - Dad.
Hey, buddy. - Take him inside.
your son needs to go in for some tests.
when he's done, we're gonna need to talk to him down in my office.
there hasn't been any activity all night.
it's not friday yet.
I appreciate you letting us take a look at his computer.
you're making a mistake, rhonda.
Chris is a good kid.
I really hope that's true. - Here it is.
well, if this all works out, i promise i'll give it back to him as soon as possible.
Christopher, we know you've been going through a lot since your mother died.
when bad things happen to us, we get frustrated, kid.
sometimes we act out and we do things we're not proud of.
he's not very engaged.
give them some time.
well, he can't postalmre, anything new to his website.
true, but the kids are still gonna play the game.
here's the full background you wanted. - Thank you.
no wonder he's a loner.
they've moved 3 times since his mother died.
cut off his peer support.
3 new schools in 2 years.
that is a lot of adjustment for a kid to have to make.
I want you to know that we're going to be confiscating your computer.
our analyst is going through all of it.
so that we can uncover the truth.
sure you will.
truth.
he doesn't seem worried about us finding anything.
they aren't building any rapport.
they're back.
Mary, this christopher kid is fantastical.
he's got a segmented hard drive, serious firewalls, major league encryption.
no reason for all that unless he's hiding something serious.
OK, so that's why he isn't worried.
this is-- unusual.
every attack i launch is shot down immediately.
what's that? - Somebody just uploaded a new video to the game site.
it's 12: 01. - It's friday. They're playing.
it's only a matter of time before some of them go wrong.
guys, i'm gonna keep dead-ending on this until i get a beat on how he set up his security system.
hope you got a plan "b.
Garcia, i think that this kid will relate to you better than anybody else.
I want you to talk to him, see if you can get him to open up.
sir, i have never done that before.
what if i mess up? - You'll be fine.
hi there. I'm penelope.
good for you.
can i sit down? - You're the cop.
um, i look like a cop to you?
Yeah. What, you aren't? - No.
FBI tech analyst.
I just have some administrative cyber crud to go over with you.
just a geekette. - Cool.
you are glum.
time is a great healer.
you have no idea how i feel.
I lost my mom and my dad when i was about your age, though.
I don't know. I think i have a pretty good idea.
and i felt totally alone.
till i found netizens.
Btdt.
Hey, i'm... I'm not lying.
it'll totally get better.
BTW, i like your nails. - Thanks.
you into goth?
you know, i don't think i'm supposed to be anymore, but the love is still there.
so you're fbi? - Yeah, i know.
it's crazy, but i love it.
I enjoy your earring, too. Where did you score that?
eBay. It's supposed to be johnny d. 'S from that pirate movie.
most awesome. - She's good.
established rapport when morgan and reid couldn't.
we should bring her out all the time.
OK, your whole pgp disc encryption system is like crazy impressive.
Yeah, i'm into that kind of stuff.
stuff? Dude, you do not understand. I am jealous.
that is state-of-the-art technology the feeb does not have.
whatever. - Ok.
how did you get your anonymizing service?
I got it from some link from some dude online.
what do you care?
I just think it's uber cool how you set your whole system up.
like how you use an e-shredder to obliterate your net activity
and a window wiper as your secondary trash eraser.
who does that? - Everybody does that.
the interview's over.
interview? - I was just
his father invoked.
dad. - I'm getting you a lawyer.
I screwed up and failed you when your mother died. Not this time.
unless you people have something to charge him with.
we're leaving.
syl, miss p.
by the way, i do miss my mom.
she's not your friend.
she was trying to trick you.
sir, i'm sorry, i tried.
if he invokes, he invokes.
concentrate on cracking the encryption. - Yeah.
judging by sheer volume, christopher's mother was sick quite a bit.
his father brought her into the er repeatedly.
she's described as being violently ill each time.
a couple of days in the icu, miraculous recovery, only to be repeated time and again.
no diagnosis, no discernable cause.
there's another video going up.
that's 4 kids playing in half an hour.
how many kids go to this school?
its catchment is the whole county. It's almost 2, 000.
Garcia, we really need to gain administrative access to the website.
I've written down a number of things christopher may have used as the password.
I've already eliminated birthdays, holidays, pet names, and pop culture icons.
no, there was something pathetic about him, not criminal.
when he was leaving, he said he misses his mom.
what's his mother's name? - Cynthia summers.
that's it. - All right, log in as administrator, shut down the main source.
already on it, my friend.
kids are still posting videos through independent servers.
pull up the website history.
see if you can learn anything from historical posts.
Christopher's er eval shows his bruises were caused by manual and ligature strangulation over time.
take a look at this.
he's also shown to have layered bruising on his sternum.
it looks like a cpr artifact.
but there's no record of resuscitations.
wait, all these transmissions are transcripts of the same administrator?
Yeah, there's only one handle.
this is weird. In the posts his voice changes.
at times he's using more articles, more precise verbiage, like he's trying to throw us off.
that's pretty sophisticated behavior for a kid.
a writer can disguise his own writing style to make himself appear younger or less educated.
Yeah, but it's virtually impossible to pull off making yourself appear older and more educated than you actually are.
there are actually 2 distinct writing style.
2 writers using the same screen name-- one teen and one adult.
christopher was being manipulated by an adult.
the mother's death is a textbook case of munchausen by proxy.
surreptitious poisoning.
the kid has been choked and revived on multiple occasions.
you said the father worked for the fire department, right?
Yeah, for a couple of months now. - In what capacity?
as an emt. - Emt. That's our unsub.
christopher didn't even understand the wiping systems on his computer.
so the father poses as a classmate and invites local kids to join the game.
bumps up the stakes and encourages them to use their riskiest methods.
he works on friday nights.
which means he gets called out to do the rescues.
he's not just collecting video tapes. His munchausen has evolved.
I'll put out an apb for his truck.
he'll find a place to download the video tapes. They're his trophies.
after that, he'll clean up his mess.
Christopher's the only witness against him.
clear.
clear!
you need to see this.
there's dozens of discs here.
I was right here. I never even looked around.
well, we only had consent for the laptop, and he knew it was encrypted.
we didn't have probable cause for a warrant.
Mr. Summers didn't have a chance to come back and get his trophies.
he'll definitely try to download the videos tonight.
this kid was doing everything he could just to survive.
the extreme abuse conditioned him to shield his father.
when his father came in the room, he seemed genuinely relieved.
his burden had been lifted.
he was elated when his father rescued him.
we need to rethink everything.
where are we going?
to see your mom.
now, let's focus on the behavior. What's the pattern?
things boil over, the father moves on.
new town, new sadistic m. o.
christopher knows his father's pattern.
so that we can uncover the truth.
sure you will. Truth.
in his mind, it will never end.
unless christopher's decided to end it.
Garcia? - Yes, sir?
when you were talking to christopher, did he say anything to you to suggest that he was giving up?
giving up? - Was he trying to say good-bye?
I don't understand.
did he give you anything? - Yeah. How did you know that?
what did he give you?
when--when we were talking, he gave me this pirate's earring.
he's made up his mind. Suicide-- the only victory over his sadistic father.
he may also see it as reuniting with his mother.
the father's going to want to download those videos from somewhere,
Garcia and we got to stop that process.
I'm already on that. I replaced the website with a phishing site.
I'm downloading it to the servers now.
when he logs onto that website, he's going to be rerouted to our server,
and we can capture his information.
stay on that site, garcia. - Yeah.
let's go. Come on.
it will buy us some time. Where are they headed?
wait. What about the mother? It's all about the mother.
Garcia, where is cynthia summers buried?
give me a second.
you know, for christopher, a cemetery would be a place of refuge, but for the father...
he's revisiting a body disposal site.
Oaklawn cemetery, halfway between here and glenrock.
OK. He would willingly go there with his father.
well, the father still needs to download the videos.
and he might need a power source.
there's a chapel. They use it for burials.
let's go. Garcia, we'll call you from the car.
you know the drill. This won't take long.
that's his suv.
Yeah, garcia? - Sir, mr. Summers just logged on.
he's caught in the phishing site. - Is he downloading the videos?
he's trying to, but all he's going to get is snow.
Oh, come on.
I don't want to die.
I decide when you die.
you guys good?
well, i can't tell you how much i appreciate y'all coming out here.
I'm just glad it ended up ok.
Oh, come on. Small-time county sheriff calls the fbi about potential suicides,
and you drop what you're doing and you come here?
we're an asset for all levels of law enforcement. It's what we do.
well, it's incredible. Thank you.
would you like to come with us?
we're going to tell the parents what really happened.
uh, no. We need to be getting back.
you sure?
I mean, i know it won't bring them back,
but i would think that knowing that it wasn't intentional might bring some level of comfort.
it will, definitely. You go ahead. Good luck, sheriff.
well, thank you.
what is that? - It's called a star puzzle.
it's basically impossible to figure out.
you have to put all of the pieces back together to form a perfect star.
but the origin of it is, um, kind of a romantic tale.
there was this young prince who wanted to win the heart of the fairest maiden in the land,
so he climbed to the top of the tallest tower in the kingdom, and he caught a falling star for her.
unfortunately, he was so excited, he dropped it,
and it smashed into all of these pieces,
so he frantically put it back together again to prove his undying love to her,
and he succeeded, and they lived happily ever after.
that doesn't make any sense.
what do you mean?
you can't catch a falling star. It would burn up in the atmosphere.
Yeah, but it's not literal, reid. It's a fable.
but there's no moral. Fables have morals.
OK. So it's just a romantic little story.
and the point is, it's basically impossible to do
because you have to take all of those pieces and put them together exactly...
there's a lot to hate about you, dr. Reid.
play poker with him sometime.
try playing chess with him. - Or go.
coffee? - Thanks.
I just wanted to say thank you.
if you hadn't pushed it, we would never have gone.
Hotch... - J. j. you don't have to.
my sister gave this to me when i was 11.
she just came into my bedroom one afternoon and told me that no matter what happened, she loved me.
this was her favorite necklace, so i told her i couldn't take it, but she insisted.
I, of course, was secretly very happy, 'cause i always wanted one just like hers.
that's the last time-- I never...
I'm sorry.
I think about her every day.
it does get better, hotch.
losing someone is... Never easy.
but one day, you'll remember her, and it won't hurt.
you'll be happy. - Thank you.
thank you for everything.
experience is a brutal teacher, but you learn.
my god, do you learn.
C. s.lewis.
Lorraine. - There you are.
I'm sorry that I'm late.
I was about to call you.
I should know better than to keep a beautiful woman waiting.
Oh, I've been looking forward to this.
got a prospectus for you.
food first. Do you like crab louie?
I do. - It is so good here.
they use stone crab fresh from the bay.
the filet is wonderful if you're in the mood for meat, or the osso bucco.
hello.
sorry.
my head is still at work, making sure I deposited a check for a client.
well, I'm a client, too.
and you're on my time now.
you have my full attention. - I better.
I have something you want.
this is all you have on him?
we have the back of his head from a few cctv angles, Nothing that helps.
he's careful to avoid being seen on camera.
out of all my cases, this guy was never flagged As top priority,
but this murder changes everything.
you were right to call us. We'll explain why.
everyone, this is Agent Russell Goldman from the San Diego white collar team.
you've already met Agent Hotchner.
these are Agents Rossi, Morgan, Prentiss, and Reid.
a pleasure.
so we're working a white collar case?
not exactly.
I've been following a con artist for 5 years.
two nights ago, I think he killed someone.
Carla marshall of miami was found dead in her home.
asphyxiation by strangulation.
she also had trauma wounds to the head.
why do we think the con man killed her?
last week carla contacted a fraud website to report a scam.
the complaint ended up on goldman's desk.
we spoke on the phone at length.
she planned on confronting him that night.
I told her to cease all communications.
and wait for me, I'd fly to miami and set up a sting.
but that never happened.
do you have physical evidence confirming it's your guy?
no, but for her to be murdered the night that we spoke,
I don't think it was a coincidence.
there was no sign of forced entry, theft, or sexual assault.
and judging from the M. O., the motive was personal.
what's his hustle? - Investment fraud.
basically, he's a smaller madoff.
to give you an idea of how convincing he is,
this is a sampling of his work going back 14 years.
he's prolific.
he's scammed hundreds of thousands of dollars from people,
but he's never been violent before.
con men usually don't murder, but when they do, it's to conceal their crimes.
con man's a nice name for these guys.
they profile as psychopaths.
they see their cons as theater and themselves as a sort of puppeteer.
they have to have absolute control over their victims and their cons.
maybe that's why he starting killing, because he lost control?
the question is, how out of control is he?
well, if he's spiraling, he's a danger to everyone around him.
and because he's so charming, the victims never see it coming.

german psychologist Erich Fromm.
I can't believe you guys have your own jet.
we take turns piloting. You want to give her a try?
Really? - No.
what kind of forensic countermeasures does he use To hide his trail?
fake I. D.S, disposable phones, prepaid credit cards, foreign bank accounts.
you can't track his accounts overseas?
we can, but it takes months to get the records,
and it only takes him seconds to transfer money again and again.
by the time you figure out, it's in the bahamas,
he's already moved it to switzerland or somewhere else.
I've always been too far behind him.
well, we're a lot closer now because of carla.
what made her suspicious in the first place?
she needed to get her father into a retirement home,
and when she called this guy Grant Dale to free up her money,
he never returned her phone calls.
a con man's first instinct is flight, not fight.
what makes him kill, though, isn't financial, it's psychological.
that's what we need to concentrate on. Why carla and why now?
morgan and Prentiss, go to her house.
agent Goldman, why don't you join them.
I sent his case files to the field office.
shouldn't I stay with you and help you sift through them?
I'd like to go through them independently, come up with our own theories,
see if any behavioral patterns emerge that'll help us get ahead of him.
agent Goldman's files are in that room down the hall. - Thank you.
let me know if you need anything. - Thank you.
you're kidding me.
we have to go through all of this?
white collar cases often come down to a paper trail.
maybe it won't be so bad. I mean, at least it's well organized.
that's his job. He sits at a desk all day and accumulates paper evidence.
all right. Dave, you work victimology.
Reid, see if you can find anything in his travel patterns.
JJ, let's get a timeline up on the board.
she was a real estate agent.
she was doing well for herself until william came into her life.
why do you call him that?
he introduced himself as Bill, Billy, or Will several times in his early cons.
my guess is that his real name may be some form of william.
so most of his victims were very wealthy, right?
you should see some of their mansions.
well, I'm looking around this house and it's nice, but no mansion.
she didn't invest as much as his other clients either.
I wonder why he targeted her.
she may have been useful to him in some other way.
Hey, Goldman. What was the alias he was using with carla?
grant Dale. - Come check this out.
he set up a website. - Why didn't the detectives find this before?
the locals wouldn't know to look for it.
well, it's only one page. Generic investment information.
I mean, there's no contacts, there's no picture of himself.
no, just photos of nice cars and houses.
so he's selling the fantasy of success.
his web design is pretty basic. I mean, it's like a standard template.
it would be fairly easy to set up.
maybe he created others. - I'm gonna call garcia.
Hey, baby girl, it's me. You're on speaker.
Oh, sug, I don't care who hears it. It's always been you.
listen, I just emailed you a link.
got it. - It's the unsub's website.
do you want me to find out how he paid for his hosting services, track him down that way?
we'll run into the same backstopping trail.
Oh, you are right. That's untraceable.
all right, we'll forget that. Can you do a search for websites containing the same content?
and searching. And searching.
there are 1, 2-- 9 identical websites, same written content, same pictures,
just different names.
these are all new aliases.
and he's never had 10 at once. This is all new.
I'm Henry Moffet. - You lied to me about everything.
what are you talking about?
your name is not Grant Dale.
God, why are you doing this to me?
just calm down. Listen to me. - No, just leave.
you're not giving me a chance to explain.
leave or I'll call the police!
I'm Henry Moffet.
the CIA assigns an agent 2 or 3 aliases at most.
any more than that, and it's difficult to keep the names straight.
this guy's juggling 10.
being all these people, that's gotta start fracturing him somehow.
if his memory is strained, it could be causing him to lose control.
we have the current aliases. We just need to know who the clients are.
got carla's phone records.
she made several calls to an unknown number the night she died.
I tracked the number. It was a disposable phone that hasn't been used since.
that's gotta be the unsub's number.
he tossed it after he killed her.
over the past few months, She routinely called this number really late at night.
how late? - Like bedtime late.
you don't do business with your investment manager at bedtime.
so, when are we gonna do this again?
my husband's coming home, so I won't see you for a while.
I'll miss you...Grant. You lied to me About everything.
leave or I'll call the police!
grant, are you ok?
Henry, are you ok?
I'm gonna miss you, too.
so Carla never mentioned anything about an affair with him?
no, but it's always been a challenge with fraud victims to be totally forthcoming.
they're so embarrassed about being duped, they don't tell you everything.
detective Goldman.
we'd like to compare notes. - Shoot.
I'm looking at the victimology.
we say affinity groups. Same thing.
it refers to victims with shared interests.
OK. We're in your world, we'll use your terms.
your files point to specific affinity groups he targeted in the first few cities.
does this look accurate to you? - Yes, it does.
once he got beyond San Diego, his victims are all over the place.
no shared interests.
I came to the same conclusions.
so he stopped using affinity groups and found his victims somewhere else.
where, I don't know. - That's where we start.
I'm Randy. Randy. Randy.
I'm Randy summerland.
I'm Randy summerland.
make us some money, ok?
I can do that.
now, how do I spell your name, again?
M-o-f-f-e-t. Henry Moffet Hedge Funds Incorporated.
who is Henry Moffet?
Randy... Who is Henry Moffet?
it's my partner.
you didn't mention anything about a partner. - I didn't?
and this isn't who I made the check out to last time.
he's been my partner for years.
then why am I making the check out to him?
there's a simple explanation.
so, the unsub and the vic are having drinks.
the vic has a checkbook and pen out, check's dated, but that's it.
the unsub got that close to getting his money, somehow failed, and then did this.
and this is overkill. He bashed his head in.
he's completely unhinged and devolving fast.
only he doesn't know that.
he's still trying to go to work and he doesn't know he's in danger of losing it at any minute.
like a functioning alcoholic.
the unsub channels all of his energy into these cons,
and when the con falls apart, this is how he handles it.
how long have you known randy?
we spent a lot of time with him In the last couple of months.
he was helping us invest.
how much money did you give to him?
he just kept saying we needed to be aggressive in this market.
Oh, my god, this is all my fault.
what do you mean? - I met Randy.
I brought this man into our lives.
Mrs. Mckelson, is there anything more to your relationship with Randy?
we're gonna find out eventually.
find out what?
Randy wasn't who he said he was.
Randy wasn't even his real name. - What?
we think this man is using his looks and his charm to target women.
so there's others.
I laid in bed next to the man who killed my husband.
did they have transgressions?
she's pretty beat up over it.
Randy, who is Henry Moffet?
daddy?
you're home!
Hey, good morning, buddy.
let me look at you.
you're a handsome devil, you know that?
I missed you. - I missed you, too.
bill, when did you get in?
just now. - How was your trip?
it didn't really pan out. - Sorry. What happened?
can we, uh, talk about this after j. D. goes to school?
I want pancakes.
Really? You do?
well, then pancakes you shall have.
you're not enjoying this, are you?
I like a good paper trail. I find it meditative.
is it really that hard for you to be normal just one time?
he just burned another alias.
you know, if this guy's on a mission to eliminate all these aliases,
he's gonna systematically assassinate his victims.
Carla lived in miami.
this victim, Frank Mckelson, lived north in ft. Lauderdale.
the victims could be anywhere in South Forida.
if he's working harder because of the economy,
it makes sense that he would expand his operating zone.
Prentiss and Rossi are on their way back. We need to give the profile.
there's something else about San Diego.
I noticed in his earlier crimes he only stays in each city an average of 14 to 18 months.
then he's in san diego for 3 1/2 years and then never in the same city for that long again.
all right, so what is it about San Diego that made him stay longer?
keep following that, Reid. See where it takes us.
are you sure?
I wouldn't be doing this if we didn't have to.
J. D.Was just starting to make new friends.
what do you want me to do? The money has dried up here.
maybe you could take a break, spend more time with j. D.
OK, then how am I supposed to raise a family If I don't have enough clients?
baby, I hate seeing you so stressed out.
all right, now, this economy is killing me.
I can get a job, too. - No.
no, I can take care of us myself.
well, we have to figure something out, because I don't want to move again.
listen, we are moving to boston. End of discussion.
honey, what happened?
now start packing.
this unsub is a white collar con man who embodies what behaviorists call the dark triad Narcissism, Machiavellianism, And aberrant self-promotion.
what that means is that everything revolves around this guy.
he manipulates and exploits others using dishonest tactics,
and he's become a menace to society.
I'm Hunter Portland.
he's also what we call a Casanova con man.
he seduces women to get to their money.
it's standard behavior for him to have casual sex with multiple partners and then use that as a weapon to accomplish his goals.
we have his sketch.
and here on the board are his aliases.
he frequents high-end venues-- country clubs, hotel bars, and membership-only establishments.
and notify the banks.
he's constantly moving money, opening and closing bank accounts.
he's active in Miami and ft. Lauderdale, but he could be in other wealthy communities, too.
look at places like Boca Raton Or Coral Gables.
he has too many aliases in his head right now and it's causing him to fracture mentally.
and it's this loss of control that triggers his violence and makes him dangerous to be around.
and any additional stress will make him more likely to attack.
I don't have to go this long without seeing you.
I could fly to wherever you are.
you would just distract me.
we'd just be spending all day in bed together.
my husband's gone for a week.
why don't you stay tonight?
I--I can't, gorgeous.
I got to deposit your check in the bank before the market closes.
do you think that we could be happy together?
what?
I could leave my husband.
slow down.
hunter. Hunter, not now.
I gotta--I gotta take this.
Hello?
don't be mad at me, but I want my check back.
what?
I got another call. Uh, don't go anywhere. - No。
Bill-- - Yes, I'm here.
I need you to pick up J. D. from Tod's and drop him off at piano.
no, I can't.
my car broke down. Help me out here.
fine.
hello.
Henry, I'm really sorry, I just-- I don't want to move forward.
look, I can guarantee your money.
why, what do you mean?
well, I don't do this for just anybody, but since it's you, I can, uh, protect you from any risk.
I'll pick you up in a little bit and we'll talk about it, ok?
OK, Henry.
I need you to listen to me. - Ok.
I'm pregnant.
it's yours.
agent Jareau said you have something.
I spoke to his victims.
before San Diego, they described him as driving exotic sports cars.
after San Diego, they described him as driving larger sedans and suvs.
before San Diego, he lived in condos, referred to them as bachelor pads.
after San Diego, spoke of living in gated communities with large yards.
what forces a man to stay put in one place for a while, downgrade his car, upgrade his house?
you think he has a family?
these are lifestyle changes a new dad would make.
why would he start a family?
because he wants to appear normal, and a family does that for a psychopath.
wives usually serve a purpose, as a caretaker or homemaker.
they value their offspring as an extension of themselves and it also feeds their narcissistic ego.
these are interesting theories, but how does this help us?
as a forensic countermeasure, con men put everything in their wives' names.
bank accounts, cars, homes.
and if his wife isn't complicit in his crimes, she'll still be using her real name.
if we find the wife, we can find the unsub.
thank you, for the drink and for guaranteeing my money.
it's all gonna work out.
I just got scared.
I understand.
you pressed the wrong button.
dad?
daddy?
Hey, that's me.
can I talk to you about something?
Yeah, of course, buddy.
do we have to move again? I like it here.
you know, I'm really disappointed in you.
sorry.
I'm really disappointed because you didn't say something sooner.
you know, if you want something in life, as a man, you need to ask for it.
now, let that be a lesson. - Ok.
so you really like it here, huh, big guy?
Yeah.
well, I think I may have found a way for us to stay for a while.
serious? - yeah.
I just need to dump my client list and start over.
so we can stay?
I'd do anything for you, kiddo.
what is that?
just hang out here for a sec, all right?
watch your video.
what is it?
spare tire came loose.
don't worry.
I'm fixing it.
massive blunt force trauma to the head, same as the others.
does it make sense for him to dump her like this?
he's killed 2 people in 2 days.
his fracturing is intensifying.
when a criminal devolves like this, they're capable of anything.
JJ said a man reported his wife missing last night.
description matches the body. Name's lorraine horton.
do we know anything about her investment history?
the team's looking into it right now.
OK, so he killed his first victim in Miami and then left town, came to ft. Lauderdale, killed his second victim here, but he didn't leave town for his third.
is there a significance to him staying in ft. Lauderdale?
guys, what if his family lives here?
that's why he's trying to eliminate threats to himself here, 'cause this is his home where he needs to protect his identity.
Hey, Garcia.
em, I feel like I've been sent on a wild snipe hunt.
do you have any idea how many women in South Florida lease luxury cars and rent mansions?
I will answer. Too many. That's how many.
OK, narrow the search down to ft. Lauderdale only.
look at women who moved here 8 to 12 months ago, see if any of them have any history with San Diego.
OK. I'll call you back when I find the elusive snipe creature.
this is gonna be good for us.
I don't understand.
I thought you would be happy.
just yesterday you were hel l-bent on moving us immediately.
Yeah, and then you and j. D.both said you wanted to stay, So I found a way to make it happen.
how?
I just did.
what is going on with you?
you know what?
I thought I was doing you a favor. I don't have time for this.
good afternoon.
I'm Stuart. You asked for the bank manager?
agents Rossi and Jareau, FBI.
we need some information on a client named Lorraine Horton.
is Ms. Horton ok?
can you check her recent banking activities, see if there's anything unusual?
maybe a check written to a person's corporation.
I know she recently came into more money.
her mother passed. They sold the house and she got a pretty good sum for it.
she sold a house? - Yes, sir.
wasn't the first victim in real estate?
we've been asking ourselves how he finds his victims now.
we just found out Lorraine got a large windfall from selling her mother's house.
Carla Marshall, the first victim, was in real estate.
when you sell a house, your property becomes public record.
your name goes on these lists.
lists compiled by lead brokers and sold to the real estate companies.
Hey, Pen.
did you know that your boat owners Frank and Dina Mckelson sold a house in Hawaii about 8 months ago?
do any of them have a direct connection to Carla Marshall?
Ah, carla generated these letters advertising the swanky beachfront condos her company sells.
stay with me-- Lorraine Horton, the lady who was murdered this morning, her address, along with the mckelsons' address, are buried in a spreadsheet in carla's laptop.
that's how the unsub found his victims. He used Carla to get her leads.
that's why he targeted her.
she gave him access to a list of people with a large amount of liquid assets.
we need that list. - Already flying to you.
but that is not all, folks. I think I may have found the wife.
I did search on women who've lived in ft. Lauderdale for the last 8 to 12 months, who rent houses and cars and have a history in San Diego.
came up with about a dozen names, but...
Ooh, la la, only one of them works in real estate. - Who?
she has a 9-year-old son, John Davison Hodges, born in San Diego,
father on birth certificate listed as William Hodges.
I got the address of the house she's renting, too.
let's head over there. Morgan, pull the son out of school.
JJ and Reid, go over the list of potential victims.
if anybody knows the unsub, send units to them.
OK, so I'm gonna go deal with this client.
will you call me later?
Yeah, I will.
did you forget something?
are you a client of Bill's? - Who?
don't do that. I saw him leaving here.
I don't know what you're talking about. You should leave.
I saw you with my husband. Do you know we have a son?
his name is J. D.
you didn't know Bill was married?
I didn't know his name was Bill.
again, this is Agent Jareau.
it's very important that you call me back. Thank you.
thank you. Yeah, thanks so much.
I just confirmed another potential victim. I sent a unit over.
I can't get ahold of this one couple, Hector and Brooke Sanchez.
hurry up. - Dad, where are we going?
we're going to get mom. It's a surprise.
what kind of surprise? - We're going to Boston.
but you said yesterday
just get in the car, ok? Hurry up.
do you know you pick your nails when you're anxious?
I've never been in a bureau car chasing a killer before.
you ready to meet William face to face?
it's about damn time.
dad, where are you going? - Quiet.
just shut up and let me think.
daddy...
I'm sorry, kiddo. I didn't mean to yell at you.
Where's mommy?
that's a good question.
that's him calling.
well, don't answer it.
we need to talk.
I am pregnant. It's his.
Oh, my god.
come on, pick up.
OK, we're going to, uh...
go hang out somewhere and wait for mommy to call back, all right?
OK.
what about that one couple from earlier?
his office said he's out of town. I haven't been able to get a hold of her yet.
it's Morgan. Hey, Morgan.
Yeah, Reid, listen, I'm at the son's school.
principal says that J. D. Hodges was pulled out of class 45 minutes ago.
by who? - The unsub.
he's gonna try and leave with his family.
all right, thanks, I'll let everyone know.
Garcia? - What up, JJ?
can you find out if Rebecca Hodges has a cell phone?
we want to try and track where she is right now.
uno momento.
something's weird. - What?
the wife has 2 cell phones listed in her name.
one could be hers, one could be his?
he put them both in her name.
Yeah, but they're both active in the same quadrant right now.
where?
some posh ft. Lauderdale neighborhood.
wait a second.
a couple on our potential victims list lives in the same area.
Hector and Brooke Sanchez.
that's the woman I can't get ahold of.
Hotch. - Ok, got it, Reid.
direct everyone to the Sanchez house. Thanks.
what's the wife doing at a victim's house?
were we wrong about her? Do you think she's complicit?
I don't think so. If she was, he'd use her in the con.
he told me his name was Hunter Portland.
how long have you been seeing him?
we vacationed in st. Croix together.
what? When? - Last month.
he said he was in boston on a business trip.
Brooke, you here?
you must think I'm an idiot. - It's not true.
how could you do this to your family?
I provide everything for my family.
were you just after my money this whole time?
no. No, I told you I was gonna take care of you.
all those times you traveled for work-- Are there other women?
God, what are you even doing here? - Daddy?
I told you to wait in the car. - J. D.come here.
please, just let him come here.
you think that I would hurt my own son?
well, you're obviously capable of anything.
please, Bill, he doesn't need to see this.
how long did you think you were going to get away with this, Hunter?
bill, let's just leave. - Just stop talking, both of you!
bill. - Shut up!
we got a car down the street and one in the driveway.
both plates match the wife's name.
remember, there's a 9-year-old boy in there and I wouldn't put it past him to hurt his own family.
or himself. - Ok, we'll take the back. You ready?
bill! - You really are a son of a bitch, hunter.
Bill-- Whatever!
bill. Let's just go.
shut up! Shut up!
daddy!
no. J. D.!
FBI. Put your hands in the air.
Oh, my god. - Please step back.
bill, let him go.
let the boy go to his mother and put your hands up.
you must be tired, keeping up with all these lies.
you don't need to do this anymore. - Let him go.
bill, please let him go.
daddy...
go to your mom, ok?
go to your mom.
sweetie, come here. - Put your hands up.
put your hands up.
don't do that!
take your hands out of your pockets!
don't!
Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.
sir Walter Scott.
do you think my husband did all this?
I'm afraid so.
the man I lived with for 10 years was loving and gentle.
he isn't capable of this.
there's more about him that we don't know.
you should be prepared.
you're going to be interviewed in detail.
right now I want to take my son home.
OK. I'll have someone drive you.
mommy!
Oh, mommy's here, baby.
you know your daddy loved you more than anything, right?
I know.
so where do you want these?
I don't care.
are you ok?
I thought he had a weapon.
Yeah. That was a justified shot.
why did he do that? He had a wife, a son.
a guy like that, he likes his car, his house, his lifestyle.
he knew he wasn't going to do well in prison.
so he decided his own fate.
I never even found out his real name.
does it matter?
come on. Come on. Sophia. Honey.
what is mommy feeding you? - Oh, nice. Give our daughter a weight complex.
do you have a weight complex? - Yes.
let's go inside.
"though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life."
"you stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes," "and with your right hand, you save me. The word of the Lord."
thanks be to God.
the body of Christ.
the body of Christ. - Amen.
the body of Christ. - The blood of Christ.
Amen.
daddy, can I have some of that?
not till you're 21. Or your first communion.
mommy, my doll... - Ok, I'm taking this away from you.
No! - Hey, ok, now is not the time to play.
after communion, we talk to Jesus.
I don't want to talk to Jesus! - Well, try.
listen, I know it's hard, but if you really try...
honey? Honey?
help! Oh, God! Please! Somebody help me! Somebody, please!
please help me! Please! Please help me!
daddy, are you all right? - Is anyone a doctor?
call 911!
Oh, no! Take your daughter away! Now!
baby! Baby, come here! Come here. Come here. Come here. Come on.
Paul! Paul! Call 911!
this is Captain Paul Collins.
he's the third victim in 2 weeks in Providence, Rhode Island.
captain? - Yeah, he just returned home 2 weeks ago from his fourth tour in Iraq.
he's a decorated war hero.
was he targeted because he's in the military?
no. Just like the first two victims, he was targeted because he was convenient.
he was killed at a church during an early service.
bled out in a matter of moments.
right in front of his daughter.
murder in a church is highly symbolic.
is there a religious agenda involved?
the detective on the case, Jake Moreland, ruled that out because of the first two victims.
the first victim, Mike O'Donnell, was found under a sink in the men's room at a restaurant.
what kind of restaurant?
local place, white tablecloths and jug wine.
the second victim, Karen Lagrassa, was killed at the laundromat.
all 3 had their throats slashed.
aside from m. O. the victimology's all over the place.
it's like this guy doesn't care who he's killing, just how.
and he's doing it in public without compunction for who sees him.
do we have a sketch?
all anyone can agree on is that it's a white male between 25 and 40.
well, that narrows it down to all of Providence.
hard to fault the witnesses given how bloody these murders must be.
what bothers me is the cooling off period is getting shorter and shorter,
with no attempt to hide who he is or what he's doing.
I mean, an unsub this bold could be suffering from a major psychotic break.
I already asked detective Moreland to pull recent releases on prisons and mental hospitals.
we need to get to Providence asap.
whether he's suffering a psychotic break or not, this could be the start of a spree.
and anyone is a potential target.
F. Scott Fitzgerald.
why is he using a knife?
guns assure the highest number of fatalities.
if all he's interested in is quantity, he could be doing this more efficiently.
he could be training.
spree killers often to dry runs before they start their rampage.
most spree killers have lost control by the time they begin.
they're always male. And if they don't fall into the school shooter category,
they're older, 40s and 50s, socially isolated.
the stressor's usually the dissolution of their last social outlet.
george Hennard was inspired by James Huberty.
between the two of them, they shot 43 people at fast food restaurants.
well, if he's practicing for his mass murder, he's definitely getting bolder about it.
and bloodier.
right now, the shock and awe of the bloodletting seems to be what he's going for.
but soon, that won't be enough.
that makes sense with regards to his fantasy life.
if he is planning something big, he'll spend his day dreaming of it,
getting back at slights both real and imagined.
without a specific target victim,
we need to concentrate on the crime scenes and see what they tell us.
Prentiss, you take the laundromat.
I'll have Detective Moreland meet you there.
I'd like to take a look at the church if you don't mind. - Good.
JJ, you and Morgan interview Captain Collins' wife.
she got the best look at the unsub. See what she remembers.
Reid and I will run point from the police station.
agent Rossi? - You must be Father Kendellen.
thank you for coming so quickly.
it's the lst we can do, Father.
to be honest, I've been struggling to understand all this.
it's been... Trying.
I don't like to see crime tape in front of church doors.
I can't imagine how you feel.
ash Wednesday's next week.
these doors should never be closed to the community.
to be honest, Agent Hotchner, when they told me BAU was coming,
I expected more than two agents.
the rest of the agents went straight to the crime scenes.
I believe there'll be information there that may determine where the unsub will strike next.
as soon as you can, I'd like you to meet Agent Prentiss at the laundromat.
Yeah, sure.
any idea on where he may hit next? We can double patrols.
it's honestly too early to tell.
well, your gut must be telling you something.
well, this far, he's struck at a restaurant bathroom, a laundromat, and a church.
he chooses his victims not out of preference, but of favorable circumstance.
with each kill he's growing bolder, telling us he doesn't care who sees him.
so next time it'll be even more public. - Yes.
our technical analyst is compiling a list of public events that your department should be monitoring.
Garcia, are you there?
wired for sound and ready for action. - What have you got so far?
well, you got your "sesame street on ice," your Harlem globetrotters, your Beatles cover bands, not to mention the dozens of college bars
and late-night hangouts frequented by the youth of America.
no event is too big or too small. - Good. Keep going.
aye, aye, cap'n.
no respect, even now.
I do the talking. - No comment, no comment, no comment.
what's the FBI's involment in the investigation in the murder of Captain Collins?
no comment.
we are strictly here just to advise the Providence Police Department.
is the Collins murder tied to the other two stabbings of last week?
and when they are ready to make their statement, they'll let you know. Thank you.
they've been out there all day.
some of my friends wanted to come by, they didn't want to be on the 6: 00 news.
your husband's a hero.
unfortunately, the circumstances of his death has caused this to be a media circus.
well, you'd think they'd show a little
what did I tell you, Sophia? Get away from the window.
are we going to be on TV?
not if I can help it. Go in your room and play. I'll be there in a sec.
I spent years waiting for a phone call or one of those letters they used to hand-deliver to dead soldiers' wives.
they want to know if I want to bury Paul at--at Arlington, but I don't have
OK.
I know you have a job to do.
let's do this so it's done right.
that's what Paul would say.
what do you need to know?
it happened right here.
you told the police you weren't sure when the unsub walked in?
Yes.
I don't know.
one moment he wasn't there, and then he was.
all right, let's walk through the mass.
you told the police that you were late.
they came in during the first reading.
you know most of your parishioners on sight? - Yes.
but not the unsub, right? - No.
I don't know how I could have missed him.
you know the Collins family personally, right?
of course. I mean, Paul, he grew up at this school.
whenever he came home, he made sure to come to mass.
and they sat there in the back so as not to disturb the mass?
Yes.
once they were settled, could you see them?
no.
then let yourself off the hook, Father.
if you couldn't see the Collins family, you couldn't see the killer.
no. - But he was definitely there by communion?
Yes. - Not before?
I don't remember. - All right.
Meg, we can take a break if you need to take a break.
what is it, sweetie?
I shook his hand. - When was that?
when we all say, "peace be with you" and we shake hands.
I shook his hand.
that's right. She's right.
during the sign of the peace.
he touched my baby. He
Oh, God. He--he touched my baby.
Meg, I know this is difficult.
but I want you to try and focus. Ok? Stay with me.
I need you to tell me what happened during communion.
we all got up. - Who got out first, Paul?
Yes.
but he let me and Sophia go first.
paul always goes last.
we-- we took communion and we-- we went back and we, uh...
we... - That's ok.
we're almost done. You're doing great.
paul was on your right.
Sophia was on your left. What happened?
she was playing.
and after communion, you pray.
I leaned down and I told her that.
so you were facing to your left, away from Paul, away from the killer.
you never see him coming, you never see him go.
I need a break. - Of course.
I want to stay here. Meg might recall...
more, and even if she doesn't, what she's going through...
what's wrong?
this unsub isn't psychotic and he's not gonna go on a spree.
he's too patient.
OK, but... What is he trying to accomplish?
I don't know.
get the stuff out...
all right, I'm folding...
I don't hear you approaching. - You always talk to yourself?
good. If these machines were on, I definitely wouldn't hear you come up behind me.
Jake Moreland, Providence P. D.
Emily Prentiss. Great. Can you do that again?
sure. - Ok.
you come in through the back door, slash my throat, walk out.
there's no cameras inside or outside of the building.
the same is true for all the crime scenes.
which means you're smart enough to plan for that in your attacks.
but, careless enough to drop a knife 10 feet after I cut you.
but you didn't leave any fingerprints. - No.
he did that at all 3 crime scenes.
mass murderers and spree killers, they often fetishize their weapons,
but this guy discards his. Why?
he can get a new knife anytime he wants.
they carry these at army/navy stores.
it could be a scare tactic. - How so?
americans typically are more terrified by the presence of a knife than a gun.
they're more likely to scream out for help if they see a gun,
whereas they'll comply if they see a blade.
so, victimology and murder weapon aren't important to this guy.
what does that leave? What is he attacking?
the crime scene itself.
did you see the sign outside when this place was established?
1967. - The same as the restaurant.
second generation Italian.
everyone in the neighborhood eats there.
St. Alvina's was built at the beginning of the last century.
so each location has a history in this community.
so he wants to destroy landmarks, pieces of Providence's history.
that's why the random victims. He's making a point.
probably the manifestation of a deep hatred for the city.
he wants to scar the places everybody knows and goes to.
not quite. Take a ride with me.
we're gonna have a look at the other crime scenes. - Why?
indulge me.
attack an institution, everybody responds.
neighbors come out, the mayor assigns extra cops.
a place of worship turns into a crime scene, you feel personally assaulted.
that's what gets him off. The response. Public outcry.
he wants the big show.
you think he's revisiting the crime scenes?
not just revisiting. Reliving.
he's found a way to keep the murders he's committed fresh because they're always on the city's mind.
witnesses say they didn't see it happen,
were alerted by the screams of the victim's wife and daughter.
man alive, in a church.
this guy, he ain't afraid onothin'.
need anything? I'm gonna grab a smoke.
careful, Connie, those things'll kill ya.
careful, it's hot.
Oh, good. Cause I love my tea really warm.
would you like some cream and sugar with your tea, too?
please.
that's how miss Tuffet likes her tea, too.
thank you.
it's good.
but I think Sophia's tea is a little bit better.
thank you.
how many do you have?
you're too good at this not to be a mom.
one. A boy.
Sophia's first communion is supposed to be next week.
she'll do great. Excuse me.
Hey, Rossi.
we're just getting ready to deliver the profile, but I need you to do something.
I understand.
OK, uh, call me when you find out more. Bye.
Sophia, mommy and Agent Jareau need some privacy, ok?
thank you for the tea. - You're welcome.
I know that tone of voice.
it's always followed by bad news.
you should know a lot of these guys need to feel powerful.
producing a spectacle gives them that sense of pride.
I'm trying to quell that by controlling the circus outside.
is he watching us?
maybe. We think he revisits his crime scenes.
it's possible the media could have brought him here.
he won't shake my daughter's hand this time if he does.
we suggest that you've think of this unsub not as a slasher but as an arsonist.
because the gratification he's getting isn't from the physical act of murder
but from the public's reaction to it.
arsonists draw attention to themselves through the fires they set.
while this unsub will never set an actual fire, he has the same psychosis as one who does.
our unsub fits that model.
his locations have been pillars of the community.
the victims he picks aren't as important as the effect of killing them outside of your favorite restaurant or place of worship.
by picking locales with the highest visibility,
he's creating the highest level of fear in that neighborhood,
which reinforces his feeling of power.
Yeah, but arsonists don't set out to hurt people.
this guy clearly does. - That's true.
and this unsub definitely falls in the category of sociopath.
his victims are there only to achieve his goal.
he doesn't have the ability to empathize with them.
to him, they're just tools for him to use, no different than a can of gasoline and a match.
I'll talk to you later, sweetie. I'm just at the market right now.
all right. I love you, too.
but even how he kills tells us something.
slashing a throat is a messy, visual act.
it's designed to create attention, just like a fire.
arsonists are often mission based.
they need make sure their first fire has burnt out before they set another one.
are these organic? - Yeah.
you know, I think I have a fresher bunch of those back in the truck. Hold on one second.
they're also highly disciplined and focused.
if conditions aren't right to set a fire, or in this case, slash a throat, they'll move on.
you know, I'm sorry, I don't.
which actually makes this your lucky day.
if you want to get something else, these hydrangeas are perfect.
they have to go home with somebody. I'll give them to you for half.
they're beautiful. Absolutely, I'll take them.
blue for your eyes. How about that?
in addition to his need to kill, he has self-control.
he has a short cooling off period because he's enjoying what he's doing.
this in turn feeds his ego and keeps him covering his tracks.
this makes him even more dangerous.
if he gets frustrated, encounters too many obstacles,
or suffers a blow to his narcissistic ego, he could go on an all-out rampage.
focus on men between jobs.
instead of working consistently, he is hunting at his next location.
and he's revisiting his old scenes. We recommend you
Yeah.
the news crews are leaving the Collins house.
he's killed again. - Yeah. Farmers Market at third and Shelby.
the press are already on their way.
we could use that. It'll feed his ego. He'll want to stay and watch.
ladies and gentlemen, when you get to the crime scene, we need you to canvass the crowd.
pay particular attention to onlookers who might be more interested in the scene itself than the victim.
and get photographs of everyone. Excuse me.
JJ, I need you there.
no, Hotch, I-- I can't leave.
JJ, you're there to control the media.
they've left to cover the crime scene, which may distract the unsub.
we can catch him, but I need you on top of the press
making sure they're focused on our goals and not the unsub's.
JJ. - Yeah. I'm on my way.
I'm so sorry.
it's OK. I know that tone of voice, too.
somebody died? - Oh, my god.
what happened?
I bet it was that stabber.
stabber? What stabber?
you know, the y who's been cutting people's throats open around town.
right. Him.
come with me, sir. Come on. Come on. - What? Wait, what?
let's go. Providence pole.
go ahead, Emily.
Hey, Rossi, I got a trail of blood here, but I haven't found the knife yet.
he ran away. See where it ends.
got it.
we can't run this locally. - Run? It's ran, it's gone.
cnn's leading with this in 3 hours. - Minimize his impact.
do not give him a name. It'll just encourage him to kill more.
am I making this deal for full access?
of course.
just attribute the good work to the Providence P. D.and leave us out of it.
he was just a nice guy who worked here.
I'd seen him here before but never bought anything from him.
what do you remember about the attack?
I asked if his flowers were organic.
I turned away, and the next thing I know I felt something warm. It was blood.
did you get a look at the guy with the knife?
the first person I saw was a guy screaming for help and he was trying to stop the bleeding.
a bunch of people ran over there trying to help, and I think I just stood there screaming.
back up for a second. Who was shouting?
I don't know, some guy.
when I turned around, he was holding the poor man up, trying to get someone to notice.
this guy must have got a lot of blood on him, yeah?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
all right, thank you for your time. Officer.
go ahead, Emily.
I found out where that blood trail ended. - And?
the unsub changed his clothes.
he left his blood-soaked ones here in the trash.
he's avoided getting blood on himself up to now. What changed?
I don't know, but whatever his reason, he came prepared.
he knew he would be bloody this time.
I'll get back to you. What do you got, Morgan?
a witness says the first responder, a citizen, cried out for help maybe 2 seconds after the stabbing.
he was the unsub. - I think so.
he's not content with revisiting the crime scene anymore, he needs to be part of them.
detective! - Yeah.
establish a perimeter around the market.
put your men no more than 20 feet apart.
every cop needs to be in sight of one another.
whoa, wait a minute. What?
the unsub is still here. - Are you sure?
start by separating the men from the women.
we found discarded clothes. That's how we find him.
we match by body type. - All right, I'm on it. Gardella, come on.
copy that.
Connor, is that you?
Hey, Liddy. - What are you going?
I gotta get back to the diner.
well, you're gonna be late. We gotta detain everyone inside here.
Oh, come on. How many hamburgers have let slide?
just following orders, buddy. Let's go.
you gotta explain to say when I'm late.
Yeah, yeah, your customers won't starve.
those gotta be on the board, too?
what's the next great bit of advice from the FBI, huh?
take it easy, Gardella. This ain't the time or the place.
if we hadn't listened to them, Liddy and I would be have our morning cup of coffee.
we profiled that he was mission oriented, and this kill doesn't fit that pattern.
the murder of officer Liddy is a significant departure
even for someone as unpredictable as this unsub.
this was a murder of self-preservation, just to get away.
this location is not his M. O. Secluded with no audience, - stabbing, not cutting. - So?
so he's out prowling the streets right now looking for another victim so the city will pay atteion to him.
you've been handed a list of locations
that we think might be of particular interest to the unsub.
we're asking you to double and even triple your surveillance in these areas.
keep your wits about you, guys.
detective, we'd like to speak to you. - Sure.
that's it, fellas. Thank you.
detective, the story has become about officer Liddy.
we need to get the attention back on the unsub or we're afraid that he may lash out.
up till now, the unsub has been disciplined enough to avoid killing if the circumstances weren't right.
like an arsonist who won't set a fire if there's someone there
to see him leaving while smoke is billowing out the windows.
what if we say that one of the buildings didn't burn?
how would the unsub react to that?
he'd be compelled to come back and finish the job.
then we pick one of the previous locations, show that the community has rallied around it,
so we need to find a location with the greatest symbolism up to this point.
that's easy.
and we use the city's fallen hero as inspiration.
should we get the chief of police or the mayor to make a statement?
it could help with inspiring people.
we've got something better.
captain Collins' widow.
I--I cannot ask her to do that.
she's highly visible, and she's someone with whom the entire city can sympathize.
when she tells the city not to be afraid to come back to church, the unsub can't ignore that.
and what happens if this draws the unsub to Meg?
we keep her with us.
we'll take the bastard down.
you want me to read this, in front of cameras? - Yes.
will my husband's killer be there?
most likely he'll watch it on TV.
you'll have police protection around you at all times.
no. I won't do it.
Meg, please. We need you.
you represent Paul's memory.
I represent Sophia. Paul's given enough. So have I.
Yes, sir. No, I understand. Thank you.
that was the mayor. He won't sign off on a press Conference At St. Alvina.
and JJ couldn't make any headway with Meg Collins.
how long has it been since officer Liddy was stabbed?
16 hours.
well, if the unsub was going to go out on a spree, he would have done it by now.
why hasn't he?
he killed a cop. He's laying low. - May be.
but we've profiled this guy like an arsonist.
it's the aftermath that matters, not the act.
you think he's feeding off the grief of the police department instead?
if so, then he's found something new to get off on.
detective. - Hold on a second. Yeah?
I need a list of establishments where your officers socialize
bars, restaurants, pool halls, everything you've got.
sure, right. Eddie, let me get back to you.
another round, guys? - Yeah. We're off the clock anays.
one more for Liddy, boys.
here's to a great cop.
we'll get this bastard for you, Joe.
Yeah, the FBI gonna help you do that?
we don't need a profile to know the kind of guy we're dealing with.
a coward.
he stabs a cop in the dark and runs away like a vermin.
gutless. - No kiddin'.
comrades, I have amassed employment records for police hangouts.
what do you want me took for? - White males 25 to 30.
I'm gonna need more than that.
arsonists typically have a stronger relationship with their mothers than their fathers,
so let's look for single-mother households with a history of abuse, bad divorce, or paternal violence.
manifestations in the son, too, Garcia, like juvenile arrests, heavy crimes, - a significant drop in grades. - Thank you, boys. That will do.
Oh, this looks like something.
what do you have?
Connor O'brien. His dad went to prison for
Oh, Lordy--not only setting mom's apartment on fire
but making it look like it was an accident so he could collect on the insurance.
Rned his kid's mother for a few bucks?
Yeah. And then Connor testified. He was 10.
Where's O'brien now?
he works at the Quality Cafe.
guys, it's across the street. - Thanks, Garcia.
FBI. Where's Connor O'brien?
Connie? He just stepped out about 10 minutes ago.
did you see which way he went?
he just went out to grab a smoke. Why?
Garcia, I need O'brien's home address.
what are you guys doing here?
we were done with our shifts. We poured one out for Liddy.
did you talk to him about the recent murders?
of course. We said we'd catch the coward.
you disparaged him. - 1121 admiral, apartment 16.
it's the other side of town.
Dave, you and Morgan meet Prentiss and S.W.A.T. on site.
clear!
he's not coming back here.
he's gonna make his last stand.
he's still gonna need to know he's foremost on everyone's mind.
guys!
it looks like he's got every article that was printed about his mom's death.
he has the prayer card from her funeral.
birthday cards.
look, all of them signed by his mom, not by his father.
look at this. That's a lot of hate.
his old man is already in prison. He can't attack him.
so he goes after the places that remind him of his father.
the only way he can get through to his dad is with violence.
william O'brien, aka Billy Os.
was a connected guy who specialized in turning faulty wiring into a 3-alarm fire.
because of Connor's testimony, he was given a life sentence for the murder of his wife,
but it was recently reduced to the possibility of parole in 5 years.
when was the sentence reduced? - One month ago.
just before the murders started. There's our stressor.
why would he do this to get back at his father if he's already in jail?
somebody's gotta pay.
he's a tough guy now.
Hey, wake up. Wake up!
your mother's dead.
time to go.
but, dad, you said I could-- - I said let's go!
it's ok, honey.
just give me one more minute, we'll be out of here.
Yeah, thanks, Eddie.
damn it.
where? - Library about a mile from here.
mother was found next to her crying baby.
is the baby ok?
not a scratch, but they haven't found the knife yet.
it's his memento now. He won't stop until he's killed as many people as possible.
we have to go to our original plan-- Create an event he can't resist coming to.
he has to believe he was unsuccessful.
if he won't go back to his apartment, and I don't think he's gonna revisit the crime scenes.
the mother from the library? She's already gone.
she bled out at the scene. The EMTs stopped working on her.
tell them to keep trying to resuscitate her.
but she's dead. - Yeah, but the unsub doesn't know that.
tell the press she made it, she's hanging on for dear life.
and we organize a candlelight vigil for her tonight.
if he's mission oriented and he thinks she's still alive, he'll have to come back for her.
and we'll be there.
let the husband know what's going on so he's aware.
have the press there. Tell them to go live and to keep the focus on us as much as they can.
Mrs. Collins.
the woman who was just attacked...
she was a mother?
Yes.
what can I do to help?
we are live at the latest crime scene, where the FBI is facilitating what appears to be...
officer! Move this crowd to that corner and pin them behind the police barricades.
we've got a female about 30, her throat's been slashed, she's hanging on.
there's a vascular surgeon standing by at the hospital.
Yeah, one, two is your change. Thank you.
can I help you?
a pack of smokes. Uh, c-could you turn that up?
crime scene, where the FBI is facilitating
what appears to be a rescue attempt of the most recent victim.
they are rushing her into an ambulance now.
make some room, please!
right this way, guys. How's she doing?
we've got her stabilized, sir. - They're coming through. Please clear it out.
can we clear a path, please.
officers, I want a 5-car escort for the ambulance to the hospital.
as you can see, she is still alive and being rushed to the hospital now.
looks like she's OK.
no, no, that's im-- that's not possible.
as many of you know, my husband Captain Paul Collins was murdered this past Sunday.
the support I have received has been inspiring.
which is why I'm asking everyone to support the latest victim, Julia Vecchia,
who is fighting for her life right now at St. Frazier's Hospital.
it's that wife of the soldier who got killed.
on behalf of my husband, we are asking you to come together at St. Frazier's to hold a candlelight vigil tonight.
please help restore this great city...
look at her. Kid's got a lot of heart.
thank you.
you think this'll work? - It should.
we've shifted the public's focus from Connor to his victim.
that should make him angry enough to show up and try to do something about it.
Connor O'brien? - Roll in now. Go, go.
put your hands where I can see them and get down on the ground!
stop right there!
stop! Moving! Stop fighting!
stop fighting! Stop!
that's enough! It's over! That's enough!
she's dead! There no possible way she could have survived!
Connor O'brien, you're under arrest.
we know why you came down here. Do you?
I had to make sure. She--she's dead, right?
what are you smiling at? You're going to jail.
in jail they treat cop killers like kings.
first you gotta see how we treat 'em at the station.
get him out of here.
it's hard to believe that guy was so starved for attention
that he murdered all those people just to one-up s father.
I spoke with Detective Moreland about Connor's father Billy Os.
he said the older police knew to give him a wide berth.
he didn't say much, but when he did... People listened.
the adult version of a bully.
there are lots of ways that sons defeat their fathers.
I just keep getting Ph. D.S.
does the son of a sociopath ever really have a chance?
you know, O'brien committed his crimes in the same jurisdiction as his father.
it's only a matter of time before he's put in the same prison.
william Shakespeare wrote, "when a father gives to his son, they both laugh.
when a son gives to his father, Both cry.
Hey, dad.
well, well, well.
does your mother know you're here?
good job today, Brenda.
Thanks, Keith. This was a great haul.
Franklin, ALASKA
Yeah. They were really biting today. It's been a while.
why don't you head back to town. I want to put the rest in the smoker.
I'll drop you off.
no. I could do with the walk.
get home to your wife.
you sure? Lisa wouldn't mind if I waited for you.
I'll be fine. Go home.
all right, well, don't stay too late, all right?
OK. I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. See you.
is anyone there?
"is anyone there," Brenda?
right. 'cause the homicidal maniac hiding in the shadows is really going to answer you.
stop messing around. It's not funny.
Oh, it's you.
I thought someone was...
JJ, that's not the point.
well, are you gonna call him?
maybe.
Mick Rawson is an arrogant, oversexed, egotistical...
hot British dude with a sexy accent, badge, and gun.
just your type.
you know what? I don't even get you sometimes.
it wouldn't go anywhere.
you don't know that.
I know our work schedules.
OK, you know what? Will and I make it work.
Oh, no.
I know. I know. I know. Don't say it.
but when you see what's in here... And it's not my fault.
they were calling to me, I swear. And they were all on sale.
and when you think about it, that means that I am helping the economy, which is more than I can say for you guys,'cause no one else has bags.
Yeah. Please tell me all of those aren't for my son.
they're not. - Good.
this one is for Kevin.
what? It is my duty as a fairy godmother to spoil the child.
and Henry is finally old enough to be fun when opening presents.
I'm not taking them back.
give me my coffee and no one's gonna get hurt.
Oh, uh, half-caf extra shot venti, 2- pump nonfat, hold the whip caramel macchiato.
next stop, xanadu.
Oh, wait. Xana-don't.
time to go to the bau, ladies.
maybe I should get a cat.
sorry to ruin your night. - What, are you working on wife number 4?
I see you people way too much.
let's get started.
all right. Anchorage field office is asking us to investigate a series of murders in Franklin, Alaska.
there's 3 people dead in less than a week.
for a town with a population of 1, 476, that's fairly significant.
it's their first murder investigation on record.
who are the victims?
uh, Jon Baker, a hunter.
Dedaimia Swanson, a schoolteacher.
Brenda Bright, the first mate on a fishing boat.
there's a new victim every 2 days. - Any connections?
unfortunately, in a town this small, everyone's connected.
different kill methods.
it says the first two victims were both shot with a rifle, but brenda bright was stabbed twice with an arrow?
are we sure it's the same guy?
all 3 victims were found in heavily trafficked areas.
the unsub wants them found sooner than later.
jon Baker's body was left exposed to the elements, but the two women were buried under mounds of trash. Why?
it could be a sign of remorse.
cover their bodies so he doesn't have to face the reality of what he's done.
or he thinks that the women are trash and he's just placed them where he thinks they belong.
well, we can't be sure of anything yet.
Franklin is an isolated fishing community that's been hit really hard by the current economy.
add to that a series of unsolved murders and everyone's on edge.
the local sheriff's out of his depth.
and Alaska hasn't handled a serial investigation since Robert Hansen in the eighties.
we'll fly out tonight. Everybody can sleep on the plane.
Garcia, I need you with us. - sir?
I've tasked a satellite uplink and it's your job to keep us connected.
Yes, sir.
this town's already on the brink, and if this pattern continues, we've only got another day until the next murder. Let's finish this fast.
is but the background and theater of the tragedy of man." John morley.
this guy's all over the map. Crosses sex and race boundaries.
he changed his kill method. It says to me he's disorganized.
yet there weren't prints at any of the crime scenes, and he isolated his victims.
wearing gloves and making sure there aren't any witnesses... That's a no-brainer.
but what concerns me is the evolution of the kills.
evolution?
well, he started with easy prey.
jon Baker was in his mid sixties.
it's relatively low-risk for a first-timer.
Dedaimia Swanson was in her early fifties.
she wouldn't be that difficult to overpower.
but he didn't have to overpower either one of them. Both victims were shot.
which is my point exactly.
he killed them both from a safe distance.
but Brenda bright was younger, more athletic.
she would have been able to put up much more of a fight, so why not shoot her, too?
that supports the disorganized theory.
maybe he didn't get what he wanted from his first two victims.
Brenda Bright was an attractive woman.
he used an arrow, but he didn't shoot her with it. He stabbed her.
I think we all know what that means.
when we land in Anchorage, there'll be a float plane to take us to Franklin.
when we get there, Morgan and Prentiss work the crime scene.
we need to know exactly how he ambushed his victims.
Reid and Rossi, the bodies. Find out what you can there.
JJ and I will work victimology. And, Garcia, town records.
find us something we can use. - Of course, sir.
I should let everybody know that reception in the area is unreliable at best.
I'm giving everybody satellite phones for communication, and I've already preprogrammed all your digits into speed dial.
guess who's lucky number 7.
welcome to Franklin. I'm deputy Flack.
are these the docks that Brenda Bright was working the night she was killed?
Yes. - All right, we'll get started here.
agent hotchner? - Yes, sir.
sheriff Rhodes. - Very nice to meet you.
good to meet you, sir, ma'am.
so I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you all could come.
the people here are really starting to act up.
I'm afraid our little town's a bit of a powder keg.
where would you like us to set up, sir?
you see, there's not much room at the station because that's also the post office.
but I have made arrangements for you to work out of Carol's tavern, which is right over there.
thank you. - Well, thank you. Appreciate it.
it's pretty isolated out here. How do you get basic supplies?
float planes bring grocery and hardware deliveries on a weekly basis, and fishermen and hunters provide the town's meat supply.
I'm Craig Ramey. You all the FBI?
what gave us away?
you're sure packing an awful lot of stuff for a fishing trip.
I'm not going fishing.
getting the hell out of dodge before it's me or my wife put in the ground.
did you know Brenda well?
everyone did. She was sweet.
she's pull a haul just as good as any guy on these docks.
as soon as I get my house boarded up, I'm heading out.
suggest you do the same, Susan.
I can't say that I blame him.
with what's been going on, I'm surprised more people aren't trying to leave.
this is Keith Graves. He was with Brenda the night she died.
Mr. Graves, did you notice anything out of the ordinary the night of the murder?
no. I offered to wait for her, but she insisted I head up to town without her.
what were you two doing that night?
we finished for the day. I left.
she stuck around to clean the fish that she wanted to take home.
she usually walk home alone? - Yeah.
Brenda said that walking was good for the soul.
how far is it into town?
about a half a mile.
the unsub could have waited for her anywhere.
appreciate your time.
sheriff asked me to keep everyone on ice till you got here.
still, I can't believe someone from Franklin would be capable of this.
what convinced you she was stabbed with the arrow instead of shot?
upward angle at the point of entry.
he would have had to been shooting from beneath her.
there wasn't much left. Forest got to him first.
I found urine on the remains. - Urine?
I thought it was from the animals who scavenged his body, but I got the lab results back this morning.
the urine was human. Is he marking his victims?
only found it on Jon. Both the women were clean.
jon was shot 3 times. The unsub grazed him twice and then hit him in the head.
Dedaimia Swanson was only shot once.
the first kill shows hesitation, uncertainty.
he wasn't confident taking the terminal shot.
it was either accidental or spur of the moment, but the second kill, he only needed one shot. He's progressing quickly.
were you close with the victims?
an occupational hazard when you're the only doctor in town.
I delivered Brenda. Never thought I'd outlive her.
look at the cuts on her torso.
they're shallow and non-penetrating.
not necessary for the murder. - You know what? These were made postmortem.
he's playing with the bodies, experimenting with his methodology.
someone incapable of remorse.
we're dealing with a psychopath.
have you determined whether or not she was raped?
I didn't even think to look.
your report says the assault occurred here.
that's right. There was a trail of blood coming from that direction.
I don't see any blood.
we covered it up. - You contaminated the scene?
we had to. We've got a rabid bear in the woods.
it's been ripping smaller game to shreds.
a creature like that smells blood, he'll come into town, no hesitation.
OK, you said the other two victims were found similar to this?
jon was found on the edge of the woods.
Dedaimia was up by crest falls.
it's a popular hiking route.
who would know their routines? - Everyone.
cup of coffee, Jace?
what are you doing?
trying to make this place a little less analog.
sorry. I forget my hacker jokes aren't funny.
my name is Penelope.
I'm the one who doesn't carry a weapon, aside from my biting wit.
and my job includes combining my kick-ass systems with your sheriff's department database to get the skinny on your neighbors and you.
or you could just ask us what you want to know.
I mean, isn't it better to just talk to us directly than look up our dirt secretly?
no. Because in my experience, the information superhighway never lies and people do.
your name would be? - Josh.
my mom Carol, she owns the place.
it goes like this. Here we are.
joshua Beardsley, age 23, born right here in Franklin, ak.
moved to Anchorage for middle and high school.
majored in hotel management at Seattle u.
and you moved back home a few weeks ago.
perfect timing, huh? I come home, people start dying.
that's when I check your criminal record.
and you, my friend, are clean as a whistle.
what does that even mean? - No idea.
no dirt, anyway, so, I guess I'm safe, then?
for now.
those two got into it last night.
Bob here, he's our newest resident, so, uh, tom figures, well, this is the guy who's doing all the killings.
he decides to smash him over the head with a bottle of booze.
look, I don't know what to do.
have you thought about having a kind of town hall meeting where you get everybody together and talk about the facts of the case?
the town's too spread out.
I mean, everybody's doing what they can just to get by, you know?
sheriff, I know people move to these remote locations to be left alone, but what happened last night is gonna keep happening, and people are going to start taking matters into their own hands.
well, I can keep order in my own town, but people around here, I mean, this is alaska, man.
they do what they want.
he's already experimenting with his victims.
he violated Brenda Bright with an arrow.
and he's inciting panic.
people who have lived here most of their lives are packing up to leave.
can you blame them?
we have a psychopath whose hunting ground is a town of 1, 400 people.
most of them grew up learning to kill animals and start fires.
it sounds like your basic survival skills.
no. They're hunting skills.
think about it. The marksmanship, the urine... It makes sense.
the urine makes sense?
it's a hunter's trick. You urinate downwind to keep the animals away.
he tried to preserve Jon Baker's body so it would be discovered intact.
all right, so we've got a psychopath with hunting skills who knows the routines of everyone in town.
how are we supposed to keep everyone safe?
sheriff, I suggest you institute a curfew until we have the unsub in custody.
nobody out after dark.
I'll have one of my deputies patrolling around the clock.
Garcia, how's it coming with town records?
I've run everyone who's been printed through CODIS. Nothing's come up so far.
I'm gonna pull an all-nighter, finish going through the town records.
should have background checks by sunrise. - Good.
the rest of us should get some sleep, start fresh in the morning.
I've got 4 of the upstairs rooms available.
uh, 4? - come on, that's the best we can do.
your team is double the size of my department.
I'll see you in the morning. - Good night.
it looks like we'll have to double up. - I'm not sleeping with Reid.
dibs.
what do you mean, you're sharing a room with Morgan?
Oh, you're jealous.
jealous? Why? Because you're bedding down with a...
muscle-bound, modern-day 007?
mm, he's more like jason bourne.
Oh, what's there to be jealous about?
he took the floor.
OK. Just... Just make sure he keeps his weapon holstered, ok?
why are you up right now, anyway? It's so late.
actually, it's early. I just got to Quantico.
damn time zones.
Hello? - Hello?
Hello?
frak.
Oh, come on, baby.
come on, come on, come on.
nice one, Garcie.
look at me. You're gonna be ok.
my name's Penelope. You're gonna be ok. You're gonna be ok.
just keep looking at me.
help! Help! Please!
somebody come help here!
someone is hurt! Please!
his name's Craig Ramey. Fisherman.
morgan and I met him this morning.
he was packing up to leave.
he's accelerating his schedule.
we should have had another day. Why change that?
Ramey was pretty vocal about wanting to get out of town.
if the unsub knew that, he could have struck early to prevent his target from getting away.
there has to be more to it than that.
he brought the body to the tavern we're staying at.
he's telling us that he's not afraid of us. He's gaining confidence.
he switched to a hunting knife. Looks like a jagged edge.
there's more physical damage, too, like he was cut open.
I won't know until Dr. Johnson does an autopsy, but I'd be willing to bet he took a piece of the victim with him.
what kind of piece?
it's hard to say, but judging from the location, I would guess liver or spleen.
he was alive.
what?
he was still alive.
baby, there's nothing else you could have done.
I felt him leave.
he was there one second, and then... Just a body.
I'm really sorry that you had to see all of that.
Derek, I...I didn't see, I was in it.
I was sort of used to seeing horrible things from the safety of my screens every day, but this was...
right there.
why didn't you go and find someone before you ran out there?
because when I got shot, I remember thinking the last thing I'm ever gonna see in this life is the man who killed me, and I couldn't let that happen to him.
he had to see something good before he died.
you ran right towards the unsub. You could have been killed.
I know that. Don't treat me like I'm the victim.
all right. I'm sorry.
I want to ask you a couple of questions, all right?
no. I... I told you everything I saw.
you said the man's face was mostly in shadow, but there was also a lot of blood on it.
you might have seen more than you actually realize.
no. Cognitive interviews, breaking someone's death down to a science and statistic...
that is your world, derek, not mine! - Penelope!
I will help from mine. - Penelope!
Derek, let her go.
will you look after her, please?
Yeah, of course.
was garcia able to give you any new information?
she's given all she can. - This guy's taunting us. He's one step ahead.
I think you're giving him more credit than he deserves.
it's like emily said on the plane, he's all over the place.
the victimology's inconsistent, the methodology's evolving, the first kill was sloppy, hesitant, and unplanned.
it was an accident, but it triggered a sexual response. He got off on it.
and he knew then and there he had to kill again.
he learned how to get the job done more efficiently.
Yeah, but why the organs?
consumption typically indicates a desire to keep the victim with them.
he's having trouble letting go. We're probably looking for someone with severe abandonment issues.
it'll be light soon. Let's get everybody together and go over what we know.
we're looking for an emotionally immature male, probably in his mid to late twenties, who suffered a traumatic loss.
now, this loss could be anything.
death of a parent, separation of a spouse, a loved one who moved away.
something that made the unsub feel abandoned and alone.
he'll have extensive hunting experience.
the bodies were buried not because of remorse, they were buried to protect them from wild animals.
his familiarity with the victims' routines suggests the unsub has lived here for most of his life.
he also has extensive knowledge of the landscape and surroundings.
so we should split up and cover the town.
focus on younger residents with a history of petty crimes and assaults.
you should look in their trash, fireplaces, even in laundry.
look for signs of bloody clothes or even cuts and bruises.
one of the victims may have gotten in a good blow or two before they died.
bring in anyone who seems to have something to hide.
the unsub has already broken patterns, so he could strike again at any time.
sheriff, you and I need to look at the school, talk to the teacher, see if she remembers any students exhibiting early signs of homicidal tendencies.
let's move.
Dedaimia was only one month away from retirement.
I can't believe she's gone.
we're very sorry for your loss.
I need to ask about your former students.
do you remember any of them enjoying hunting too much, so much that it worried you?
all the boys around here like it too much.
they have competitions to see who's the better shot.
this would have been extreme.
do you remember anyone who might have tortured animals or played with them before he killed them?
does that sound like someone you know?
I've never seen anyone enjoy hunting as much as Joshua Beardsley.
he's the tavern owner's son? - Yeah.
the youngest boy in town to bag a deer.
that's all he ever talked about.
he hunted something nearly every day.
he was born and raised here.
he returned a couple of weeks ago after his dad died.
how old is he?
23? - Sure.
we need to talk to him. - All right.
thank you.
what's this about?
the strike was above the gut.
it keeps the meat from spoiling. Isn't that right?
on a deer, maybe.
doubt it'd be the same for a human.
but then he did something interesting.
he took the victim's spleen.
now, tell me, why would he do that?
no idea.
let's stop playing games, Joshua.
answer my questions and maybe I'll believe you.
it's a native hunting tradition, isn't it?
eat part of the kill.
gain the life force of your prey.
not many people know that.
I'm not many people.
where did you learn to hunt?
bagged my first deer when I was 7.
that's pretty young.
my dad taught me how to live off the land.
I ate the heart of my first kill.
that proves you're a true hunter.
so, you, um, enjoy hunting?
it's my favorite thing to do.
then would you say you take pleasure in the kill?
doesn't everyone?
actually, no...They don't.
what do you think? - I'm not sure.
he fits the profile, but he's acting like a man with nothing to hide.
the attack cycle's accelerating. He should strike tonight.
and if he doesn't, we know we've got our guy in custody.
and what if he does?
look, I hate to say it, but half this town matches most of your profile.
what are you guys working on?
Hotch asked if we'd go through garcia's background profiles, try to find a link between joshua and the 4 victims.
you find anything?
they all had hunting licenses.
needle, meet haystack. Yeah, we need the big guns.
ripped and ready to rumble.
uh, maybe you should sit this one out.
no, Jaje, I'm ok.
put this bastard where he belongs.
joshua beardsley? - Yeah. We think he's our unsub.
no, he's not.
he fits the profile. Abandonment issue triggered by his father's recent death.
Reid... - Hunting experience, - Experimentation with animals. - Reid.
you arrested my son?
we brought him in as a precaution.
I'm telling you, it's not him.
what makes you so sure? - Because the unsub ran away from me.
of course he ran. He knew you were FBI.
but Joshua knows I'm a techie. He knows I don't carry a weapon.
if he was the unsub, I'd be dead right now.
how can you be listening to any of this, Steve?
you know Joshua would never do this.
look, I never thought any of us were capable of doing this.
but 4 people are dead, Carol.
you don't know him. He's a good boy.
he's a good boy who recently lost his father and it's a lot of emotional stress.
it's been tough, but we're coping. He's doing fine.
why did he move back to town?
I needed him here to help with the inn. I can't handle it on my own.
and how did that make him feel, having to drop everything and move back home?
he didn't do this. - we need to be sure.
I'm sure. I'm his mother.
Carol, it's one night.
if nothing happens, you pick him up in the morning.
wait a minute. You said the unsub has abandonment issues.
and Craig Ramey was leaving town, right?
Yeah, he couldn't wait to get out of town.
OK. Uh... Let's see.
Dedaimia Swanson was retiring in a month.
she was moving to Florida. - What about the other two?
un, Jon Baker just bought property in Fairbanks, and he and his wife just separated.
she just filed the divorce papers.
well, welcome back, red delicious.
take a bite out of this.
so far, 3 of our victims were on the fast track to getting out of town.
and let's see... Connect 4.
Brenda just accepted a job in Seattle.
anyone else look like they might be leaving town?
um... I got one. Kat allen.
she was accepted to the summer honors program at the university of Bloomington.
she currently works as a waitress at big John's coffeehouse.
Penelope, you are... - So ready to go home.
we're looking for Kat Allen.
I'm Kat.
can we talk?
it was completely unexpected.
never been married. I'd given up on ever having kids.
do you mind my asking who the father is?
a guy I met on a cruise.
he doesn't want anything to do with her. But I do.
I want to be able to give her a good life, so I'm going back to school.
did you tell anyone that you were leaving?
Yeah. A couple of people.
uh, I don't know... My mom. My boss.
we're going to need you to come with us.
Why? What's this about?
it's just for tonight. It's for your protection.
damn it.
the neighbors saw the door open, called it in.
he went from ambushing people in public to home invasion.
that's a pretty big change in M.O.
this one's personal. It's angry.
her intestines are splayed out everywhere.
Yeah. And the blood on her face is smeared, not splattered.
he played with the body. He mutilated her.
if this guy's killing people leaving town, why didn't he attack Kat Allen?
because we had her in protective custody.
he couldn't get to her, so he moved on to another target.
a target who broke her routine.
Carol was scheduled to be at the tavern tonight.
how did the unsub know she was here?
he was stalking her.
he chose Carol for a different reason.
Why? What's changed?
you guys finally realize i'm innocent?
joshua, please have a seat.
more questions? You serious?
I'm telling you, I didn't do this.
we know that, son. Please, sit down.
what's going on?
Josh, the...The killer struck again last night.
Ohh, god. Who did he get?
why are you guys only telliling me this?
Where's my mom?
no. No. No. No, no, no, no.
no, no, no, that's impossible.
she... She was just here. I... I just talked to her!
I'm sorry, Joshua. She's gone.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No, no. You... You're lying.
I wish we were.
I need to see her. - not right now.
you don't want to think of her that way.
joshua, we know you need time to mourn, but the fact of the matter is, the man who did this is still out there, and we think that you can help us find him.
you had me locked up while she was...
I could have helped her.
if you had gone to her, there's a good chance you'd both be dead.
now we need your help. - Why me?
the murders began when you returned to town.
now, up until now, he's only targeted people who were trying to leave, but for some reason, with your mother, it was personal.
the pressure's on. The FBI is here.
in that situation, a serial killer wants to finish what he started, - He goes after the true target of his cause. - Personal?
can you think of anyone who had a grudge against her? Anyone at all?
how about anyone with a grudge against you?
no. No. Everybody loved her.
the man that we're looking for has severe abandonment issues.
now, can you think of a time when you or your mother left somebody, maybe like a bad break-up or a fight that ended a friendship?
did your mother ever take anyone in at the inn who had family problems, maybe someone who had been kicked out or lost someone unexpectedly?
no. No, no, no, no, there was nothing like that.
uh, listen, can I go see my mom now?
Josh. Josh, you need to let these people help.
no, I need...I need to see my mom.
well, let's have someone take you. - It's ok. I know the way.
did you see his behavior shift from wanting to help us to wanting to leave? He's lying.
because he knows who the unsub is.
I got one of my deputies tailing Joshua.
if he does something stupid, we're gonna know.
there's got to be a connection we're missing. Garcia, anything?
their lives have been torn apart, figuratively and literally, and I can't find anything.
try again.
I'm hacking into his college database as we speak.
maybe there's something about his life in Seattle I may have missed.
good. All right, why Carol? Why the mutilation? Why the overkill?
mutilation?
you said you found the remains of mutilated animals in the woods from a rabid bear?
that's right. - Did you take pictures of them?
of course we did.
we documented everything for identification.
we'll need to see those pictures right away.
sheriff, we need to adjust the profile. - What do you mean?
these animals weren't mutilated by a rabid bear.
someone did this.
you mean a person. - An animal wouldn't have left so much.
we should have seen it before. It's homicidal triad 101.
we said the kills were all over the map.
the unsub lacks sophistication and shows immaturity in his kills because he is immature.
he started with animals because that's what he was taught ever since he was a child.
and when he got bored with animals, he moved on to more challenging prey.
people. - Your unsub's a teenage boy.
the boy we were talking about before, he wouldn't be a former student, he'd be a current student, a teenager who loves to hunt.
I only have two teenagers right now. Both of them are girls.
go ahead, Garcia.
I found something uber weird.
in Joshua's college application essay, he talks about the impact that being an older brother had on his life.
I thought he didn't have any siblings.
he doesn't, and yet he's talking about how hard it was to leave him behind when he moved to anchorage, to leave him unprotected.
Thanks.
was there a student that Joshua may have taken under his wing before he moved away?
someone you may have suspected was being abused?
Oh, my god. - What?
Owen Porter. He's not a student anymore. He's home-schooled.
joshua and he were attached at the hip when they were younger.
I've been called out to the Porter house several times.
domestic disturbance.
Owen and his mom always covering for the dad.
let's go. - Thanks.
talk about abandonment issues.
Owen was left victim to the abusive hand of his father.
Joshua's return probably derailed owen's mental stability.
add to that the accidental shooting of Jon Baker and he snapped.
he got off on that first killing. - He had to do it again.
so he targeted people trying to leave town.
in his mind, when people leave, he gets hurt.
and he resented Carol for taking Joshua away, so he killed her to make sure he never left again.
where would he go now?
we're surrounded by waterways and mountains. He could be anywhere.
Mr. Porter, is your son at home? - What's it to you?
turn that off.
did you know? - Don't know what you're talking about!
not for sure. Not until last night.
he came home covered in blood. - He's not here. But the window's open.
it's not the first time you've washed blood out of his clothes, is it?
don't answer them, Martha! - Sit down and shut up.
I promise he will not lay a hand on you again.
no. It wasn't the first time.
Mrs. Porter, I understand you're only trying to protect Owen, but you can't anymore.
he's always been different. He's not like us.
when he was a little boy, he used to go out into the woods and come home covered in blood.
why didn't you tell anyone, Martha?
how could you just sit there and do nothing while people died?
how did owen react when Joshua was sent away?
he wanted to leave, too.
but I couldn't let him.
Mrs. Porter, do you have any idea what social isolation does to a child?
I was afraid of what he might do if he ever left here.
we knew. We knew what he was.
we've got a problem. - What is it?
joshua managed to shake deputy stiller.
and someone reported a hunting party going into the woods.
Oh, god.
they're hunting Owen.
listen. That way. Go.
you have him? - No. He's moving too fast.
looks like he's circling back towards town.
maybe we'll get lucky.
did they just shoot him? - They would be shooting if they weren't close.
let's go.
do you know where he's headed?
was there a place he went to be alone?
a hiding spot when you were mad at him?
hiding spot. How the hell are we supposed to know?
if you know, you need to tell me.
I'm trying to help him. There's a mob out there, and if they find him, they're not gonna turn him over.
they're gonna take justice into their own hands.
if you value your son's life, you need to help me.
Martha, don't!
lake lafayette.
he and Joshua built a fort there when they were younger.
you'll need a boat upriver to get there.
hold on, guys.
Yeah, hotch, what's up?
OK. I got it. There's a new plan.
he's heading for the harbor.
Owen, put the gun down. - Drop it, son.
who do you want to take your chances with, us or them?
drop the weapons and back away!
can't do that, agents. The boy's coming with us.
it's not happening! - Back down, Keith. We're in control now.
what are you gonna do, Steve? He's 16.
send him back to juvey so he's out in 2 years?
he killed my mom. - He killed brenda.
he needs help and he will be held accountable for his crimes.
accountable? 5 people are dead.
why'd you do it, owen? Why'd you kill her?
you left me behind. - You killed my mom!
she sent you away!
you left and you didn't come back.
8 years and I never heard from you again.
please, just let us take him in.
sorry. I can't. I know what you're saying is right, but I can't do it.
I'm terribly sorry for your loss, but please just put your guns down so no one else gets hurt.
are you kidding? You're outnumbered and outgunned.
who do you think has the higher ground here?
I'm pretty sure we do!
no... What are you... What are you doing?
we can still take him!
it's over, Joshua.
he killed my mom.
I know, and I'm sorry.
you shot him?
he'll live.
it sucks, doesn't it? - What?
just knowing that we couldn't have done any of this without you.
Yeah, pretty much.
I'm proud of you, Penelope.
despite everything that happened, you came back...
and you got the job done.
the sight of blood used to make me run away.
and two nights ago I ran towards it.
it means you're changing into someone stronger than you realize.
you cared enough to risk your own life to try and save someone else.
Yeah, but...
what's the difference between being strong and being jaded?
I'm scared, Derek.
I don't want to lose who I am just so I can do this job.
we are in one of the most beautiful places on earth.
I know you see that, don't you? - Yeah.
then we have nothing to worry about.
it's who you are, baby girl.
you see the beauty in everything and everyone no matter where you go.
that part of you is never gonna change, and I won't let it.
I don't need you to protect me. - Tough.
I think I'm gonna stay on the job a little while longer. - Yeah?
how much longer?
every day of my life.
I kind of love you, Derek Morgan.
I kinda love you, Penelope Garcia.
Ralph W.Sockman said, "nothing is so strong as gentleness, and nothing is so gentle as real strength."
this is Dorris archer, she's the third woman to go missing in Boise, Idaho, this year,
along with Paula Renmar and Samantha Rush.
they went missing roughly 2 months apart.
well, hello.
what, did you join a boy band?
no.
OK, so what are we looking at here?
late 20s, early 30s.
all single, though two are in committed relationships.
all living on their own.
looks like normal suburban houses. Gives the unsub privacy.
the differences are more striking than the similarities.
different hair colors, different body shapes.
what do you know about his M. O?
that's why we were invited in.
the abduction sites are pristine.
and there's no DNA besides the victims',
and there's no sign of forced entry or a struggle.
and the victims aren't reported missing until 2 or 3 days after they're abducted.
2 or 3 days
women like this don't just vanish
without somebody noticing.
Yes. Which is why I asked Garcia
to dig into their lives.
and when I took a look at their online activity,
I could easily see how the unsub is doing it.
social networking sites.
Yeah. Facebook, Twitter.
you name an online life-sharing time suck,
the victims were on it.
and if you look at each of their last posts,
they say kind of the same thing
going out of town, going on a business trip,
going on a vacation.
but when you look at the time and date stamp
of each of these, cue the "Twilight zone" Music,
because they were all posted the morning after each of them went missing.
the unsub posted them.
social networks are an easy way
for an unsub to target his victims.
these women were especially open.
they posted everything from what they were having for dinner
to where they were going on dates.
so this unsub friends his victims
and then uses that as a cover once he takes them.
that means he can hack into their accounts.
so he's excellent with computers.
definitely profiles as patient and organized.
he's obsessive enough to remove all forensic details,
but also patient enough to wait 2 months before abductions.
he can afford to be.
he gets 3 days to do whatever he wants to these women.
that means we need to assume these women are already dead.
the question is what he does while he has them.
the single biggest problem with communication
is the illusion that it has taken place.
george Bernard Shaw.
so if this unsub is using social networks
to find his victims, can't we use that to find him?
Yeah, if these women each had 100 friends. Following them, then the unsub would pop up on each of their lists, right?
uh, the Detective in charge, John Fordham,
he looked into their groups. Everyone checked out.
social networking sites are surprisingly insecure.
facebook recently tried to update
all their privacy settings, and in doing so,
they made everybody's profiles viewable.
can somebody explain to me the appeal of these sites?
eating Sushi tonight. Yum.
boss is keeping me late at work. Grr.
whose life is so important
that we'd be interested in this kind of detail?
I don't know. I guess that's the running joke, right?
I mean, nobody is. But we'd all like to believe
there's actually an audience out there
that wants to follow our every move.
you know, some sites actually have a GPS feature built in.
you can tell exactly where someone is
every time they post a new comment.
this is telling us how he's finding them,
but it's not telling us how he's getting into their houses.
at the very least, I believe that he has copies of their keys.
Dorris archer had a home security system installed,
but the disable code was entered at 1: 56 A. M.
so he knew that, too.
he also found a way to deal with her dog.
a German Shepherd she adopted from the pound last year
went missing the night that she did.
all right, so this guy's gotta be in and out of the house well before the night of the disappearance.
he comes up with some ruse, talks his way inside,
then once he's familiar enough with the house,
he knows he can come back and kidnap them -Without disturbing anything. -What about the people who come into your house that you don't consider a threat?
home repair guys, dog-walkers.
Yeah, Detective Fordham looked into that, too.
no one even came close to being a killer.
OK, Morgan and Prentiss, start with the last abduction sites.
see if anything point to his M.O.
Dave, you, Reid, and JJ go back over the women's lives.
start with their friends on the social networking sites.
if this is how the unsub is finding them,
maybe they're connected to him without even realizing it.
uh, Detective Fordham.
agent Jareau?
Yeah. Uh, these are SSA Hotcher, Rossi, -And Dr. Spencer Reid. -How do you do?
well, thank you for coming. We can really use your help.
did you find anyone willing to talk to us about the victims?
the problem wasn't who to bring in.
it was who not to.
the man we're looking for
might have found your daughter through her social networks.
did Paula mention anyone new in her life?
no.
no one who started following her as a friend,
someone she didn't recognize?
I don't really know how those work.
someone sent me an email
congratulating me on Paula's promotion.
I didn't even know.
and when I asked her, she said, "Mom, I put that on my wall last week."
she was gone 2 days later.
Samantha was rigorous about keeping her status updated.
she's obsessed with those sites.
so I'm assuming she knew who followed her, then?
Oh, God, no.
she had over 1, 000 friends.
Wow. Why so many?
we both worked in real estate.
she saw it as the perfect way to promote herself.
so, wait. Even though she told all those people what she was doing, she didn't know who was following her?
you ever have so much email,
you feeling like you're drowning in it?
actually, I don't have email.
Seriously?
then let me break it down for you.
these websites are like email on crack.
it's impossible to keep up with everybody.
we just have a few more questions
about your girlfriend's disappearance.
did Dorris ever mention letting someone in her home?
like who?
well, we're just trying to figure out
who would know the code to her home security.
it must have been someone she trusted with the combination.
no. She was smart.
she took precautions.
that's the whole reason she got Bruno.
Bruno--the dog. So he was a guard dog?
Yeah. She trained him for like 6 weeks.
OK.
um...I know these are hard to look at,
but do you see anything different?
something he may have done to get himself inside.
this isn't right.
what's that?
the photographs. This is when we first started dating.
the one on the right should be on the left.
OK. And she wouldn't have rearranged them herself?
no. She arranged them a certain way to tell a story.
it was--it was how we fell in love.
OK, JJ, I got it.
you see it?
actually, yeah.
looks like he did try to hang something on the wall.
there's even a little residue left over.
let me call you back. -Yeah.
Yeah, what do you got?
Hey, I got one up here, too.
what would he try to hang on that part of the wall?
well, from here,
I have an unobstructed view
of the second floor and down the stairs.
it's the same thing down here.
you can see the entire entrance.
cameras.
he put up cameras.
we think this is what he's using to spy on his victims.
they're small, they're cheap, and they're easily hidden,
behind photos, books, or plants.
the footage they record can then
be transmitted anywhere. Website of your choice,
even your cell phone.
and he can toggle between cameras
to see everything that's happening in the house.
and you found 5 of these at different points in the house?
upstairs, downstairs, bedroom, even the bath.
a ruse gets him in the door,
but it doesn't buy him enough time to put up 5 of these.
right. That's why we think he starts with one camera
facing the front door.
that tells him when it's safe to enter the house,
when she comes and goes, when the dog-walker comes,
and what the combination to the house is.
it fits his M.O.
it he learned their every detail on social networks,
he will be just as obsessive in his surveillance.
and once he learns their routine, all he has to do
is pick the lock, put up the rest of the cameras, and boom, he got their whole life at his fingertips.
what does he do with the video? Maybe he keeps them?
if he's a voyeur, yes.
Ah, voyeurs are rarely violent.
their excitement comes from spying without the object
knowing they're being watched.
and by abducting his victims,
he's removing the outlet of his sexual release.
Reid is right.
so he must have some other agenda with these cameras.
he might be sharing the footage with other people.
we need to have Garcia dig into surveillance
in illegal video websites.
I'm going to take this with us. -Why?
we originally profiled there wasn't any facial similarity between the victims, but I'm not so sure that's true.
I want to compare Dorris' picture with the other victims.
these videos the unsub took, it looks like
one of them he posted online, which may help me nab it.
if he puts it on the Web,
can't you track that back directly to his computer?
normally, yes. Normally, in like in 17 seconds
I can get you the network he's using,
get a physical address of his modem,
and presto change-o, no more bad guy,
but this unsub is a creepy computer aficionado.
do you guys know what a proxy server is?
it's an Internet relay.
precisely. Kids use them to get around blocked sites.
now, usually one proxy is plenty,
but this piece of work is using dozens of proxy servers.
he's bounced his signal off of China, North Korea,
russia, South Africa...
Garcia, can you trace him back to Boise?
of course I can, and that's what I'm doing?
time is the unfortunate ingredient I need, though.
this just in.
looks like one of the proxy servers archived what he was streaming on the night of Dorris archer's disappearance.
can we see it? -Pulling it up now.
well, Prentiss and Morgan were right.
he knows the house.
and the dog knows him.
Oh, please don't hurt that doggie.
how many trips inside the house would that take?
a dozen?
see that? The camera's attached to him. It's his point of view.
so he can relive it over and over again.
OK, can someone tell me when this is over?
please. -Not yet.
he's tender to her.
she means more to him as a corpse than as a living person.
Garcia, we need to find the unsub's network.
even if it's a rough area, it'll help narrow the geographic profile.
Yeah. Sir, that's totally what I'm trying to figure out.
uh, there is something else kind of huge you need to know about.
do you see this line of code there?
Yeah, what about them?
it allows the user admin, and in this case, the unsub, to set up a chat room.
people were watching this on the night of the murder.
we thought he was posting these after the fact. He's not.
he wants people to experience it with him.
he wants an audience.
he has fans.
can you freeze that?
he's acknowledging the camera.
tip of the hat to his fans. He knows they're watching.
classic narcissistic behavior.
he's performing for his audience.
we know the M.O. The question is how.
what kind of job gives him access to the victims' houses?
it has to be network and I.T.S,
the guy you let in to hook up your Internet.
gets him in their house and on their computers.
I went through all the women's Internet service providers with a fine-tooth comb.
they all used different companies
and no overlap with sales reps.
what about onsite tech support?
Oh, well, clean as a whistle.
they all had alibis with no criminal records.
what I don't understand is,
why does he take the bodies with him after they're dead?
Yeah, it'd be one thing if he took them while they were still alive,
but he's accomplished his task.
he murders them and he completes the performance.
so why take the risk of carrying a corpse to your car?
well, there must be some postmortem behavior
or signature or something we're not seeing.
well, think about that for a second.
he's sharing this murder with a crowd of onlookers.
what could he be doing to these bodies just for himself?
Hey, guys.
Garcia's got something for us.
go ahead, baby girl.
OK, friends, I have some good news,
but first, here is the thing that sucks.
I located the network the unsub is using in Boise,
and it is the victims' own wireless.
so does he hack in before he starts with the murders?
hacking is obscenely time-consuming.
I just make it look easy because I'm a genius. But he's not me.
so my guess is that he's got to lurk around their network for at least a couple of days to a week before he kills them.
that's pretty brilliant on his part.
Yeah, he knows when we follow his online paper trail
that it'll lead us right back to the murder site.
what's the good news?
hackers are very loyal to their spoofing techniques,
and if they think no one's watching,
they'll use the same roads over and over.
OK, so if he goes through Russia, China, and north Korea again...
I have flagged those servers,
and if he uses them in the same order,
I will catch him so fast.
that's only going to help us if he commits another murder.
Yes, that's also true.
excuse me.
Garcia, if he does stream this again,
how much time will you need to find the network?
Oh, uh, that's hard to guess
with all the international pinging. I
ballpark. -Uh, 7 minutes?
that's not fast enough. He's in and out of the house in 5.
Oh, God. I'm going to have to trim my time down, then.
Garcia, get it done. JJ, we need to call a press conference.
now that we know how he's killing these women,
we need to get it out there.
uh, all right, I'll, uh, prescreen the journalists I call on,
hope we don't get anything out of left field.
good.
I know what connects the victims.
I was staring at pictures of the victims
and I knew there was a pattern connecting them,
but I couldn't tell what it was until I broke it down mathematically.
why are we so drawn to celebrity faces?
because there's a symmetry to their beauty
the eyes, the ears, the ratio of the forehead to the chin.
the more balanced they are,
the more appealing they are to our eye.
these women aren't celebrities, though.
no, but there are similarities between them,
and it wasn't until I scanned their pictures and got it to the guys at Quantico that I had a full breakdown.
all right, strip away eye color, hair color, and skin tone,
and what are we left with geometrically?
they're all slightly dystopic.
the left eye is slightly lower than the right eye on all the victims.
all the noses are narrow.
the forehead has the same Ridge.
he might not even be aware that he sees it in them.
there have been studies that suggest
that we pick our spouses subconsciously,
based on a facial symmetry that we recognize.
so consciously or unconsciously,
when he recognizes it, he has to destroy it.
which means he only has interest in the bodies
as they relate back to him.
maybe...
they're a reflection.
remember what he did at the end of the video?
he wiped the tear away.
another act of compassion he's not capable of.
his narcissism prevents him from that.
in the Greek myth, narcissus was so self-absorbed
that he fell in love with his own reflection in the water.
exactly. He finds women with the same face,
he strangles them, and then stares at them after they've died.
but whose image does he really see?
his own.
thank you.
most of us take the Internet for granted.
we forget about texts that we share
or updates we put on social networks.
but the Internet never forgets.
once it's out there, it's out there forever.
now, we all know about the horrific deaths that get shown on the Web.
the murder of a journalist. The stoning of an Iranian dissident.
those murders are immortal.
and this unsub craves that same immortality.
he recognizes his face on theirs
and he kills them as a way of saying, "This is what I look like."
we think this also informs his compulsion
to take the bodies with him.
he takes them to a secondary location
where we believe he preserves them,
so that every time he looks at them,
he sees his own ego reflected.
fortunately for us, this means we have a good idea
of what he looks like.
based on the shape of the victims' faces,
we have a rough composite sketch.
this unsub is an expert with computers and home networks.
so look into criminal records of men with extensive computer training.
we know you've already looked into the victims' computer I. T. Settings,
so we'd like to expand the search.
look into electronic stores,
computer distributors, I. T. Departments where the women worked.
we overuse the term narcissistic in our culture,
but we're going back to the psychological definition.
every aspect of this man's life
has been constructed around an inflated sense of self.
unsubs like this are particularly vulnerable
to what's called narcissistic injury.
if his self-worth is attacked or damaged, he will lash out.
so, if you find this unsub, do not challenge him publicly.
say you just want to talk him,
see if he knows anything about the brilliant mastermind who's stalking these women.
under no circumstances should you denigrate him.
as difficult as it is, we need to talk up his exploits
as if we respected him.
searching for wireless server dound kitgirl 29
this is a sketch of the man we're looking for.
he is a white male,
roughly 5'10."
he's highly skilled with computers and networks.
we encourage everyone to monitor the information they post about themselves on social networks.
do not document the details of your day.
don't post pictures of yourself, friends, or family.
all right, we'll take some questions. Yeah?
how did the FBI generate this sketch if there were no eyewitnesses?
it's an approximation based on a video we recovered.
OK, yeah, what's your question?
can you comment on the rumor he has some sort of facial symmetry with his victims?
does he look like them?
right now the Boise police are pursuing several theories.
that's not a no.
why would he target women who look like him?
it's too soon to speculate on how or why he chooses his victims.
well, what should people do to protect themselves, change their face?
no, just update your online security
and be vigilant about what you post.
all right, we're done with questions.
thank you. Thank you.
somebody leaked our profile.
the press started asking questions about facial symmetry.
it must have been one of your officers.
look, my guys were checking their cell phones,
but that's just habit now.
all right, I can talk to the press independently,
I can keep this off the 10: 00 news, but
I know. It went out live.
well, what are the chances he didn't see it?
not good.
Oh, your crafty little sicko.
sir, it's fantastic you called. I just figured out
how are you doing on pinning down the networks?
OK, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
remember how I said he was spoofing his signal off different servers?
well, it turns out some of those are a decoy meant to waste my time.
so does that mean you can find him faster?
totally. Totally. I can write a program
that filters out the decoys
Oh, crap.
is that him?
Yeah. Uh...
OK. It looks like I'm gonna have to filter this on the fly.
can you send us the feed?
I think I can intercept it in Ukraine.
he's going live.
look at the way he's moving.
he's not slow and deliberate. This guy's pissed.
all right, what do we see? Determining markers.
a one-story cottage.
it could be anywhere.
is there a number on the house?
no, and he's already at the door.
he's using twice as many proxy servers.
wait. This window here on the bottom- is that the chat room?
there she is. He's in the house, guys.
he's completely changed his M.O.
it is way too early. There's too much light.
what happened?
someone asked the wrong question at the press conference.
Oh, my God, turn around. Just turn around.
maybe she can fend him off.
new kitchen appliances. Can we track them through work orders?
he'll be gone by then.
Garcia, give us something.
I'm stateside now. I'm almost to Idaho.
I just need more time. -You're not gonna make it
Yes, I will. I will. I
forget the unsub. Can you run a trace on everybody in the chat room?
I can't do both, sir. Let me do this.
Garcia, tag the viewers. That's an order.
baby girl, it's gonna be OK.
no, no, it's not. It's bad enough
that there's been so much death around me,
but this guy is all up in my turf,
and he's really good at what he does for really awful reasons.
that's why you're gonna find the perverts
that watched it happen in that chat room,
and we'll nail them to the wall
and they're gonna give up the unsub.
no, no, that is not good enough.
I want to watch him suffer. I want to watch him bleed.
Oh, God, I just scared myself.
good. That's a good thing.
because if there's one thing I've learned the hard way
is the last person you want to tick off is miss Penelope Garcia.
Ohh...That's a compliment, right?
Yes, it is.
we will beat this guy. Believe that.
now, I'll call you when we've got something. -Ok.
her name was Allison Kittridge, 29.
this was her first house.
all right, so this unsub accelerated his timetable and his M.O.
he was moving faster because he was angry.
Yeah. The press conference told him something about himself he didn't like,
so he rushed. Which means he made a mistake.
now, what was it?
well, it wasn't the cameras.
he remembered to take those with him.
it wasn't the body. He took that with him, too.
Hey, did, uh, Garcia find anything unusual with Allison's wireless?
no. Records show that it was a basic DSL installation.
Hey, Prentiss.
Yeah. Help me move this table.
what do you got?
you see this line right here?
Yeah.
this is what brings the Internet from the street into the house.
OK. So? -This isn't DSL.
it's not?
it's a fiber-optic cable.
completely different type of connection.
we just found his mistake.
if there's already an Internet connection in the house,
why does he bring his own with him? Is it the upload speed?
fiber-optic allows him to stream large amounts of video.
and maintain a chat room.
that's dozens of computers connected to him at once.
he'd need a lot of bandwidth for something like that.
we checked all the ISPs. Why didn't he turn up?
I get mail, phone calls, people knock on my door all the time
to see if I want to upgrade my Internet.
Yeah, I get them, too.
and they'll offer to come inside and demonstrate
how much faster their connection is.
you think that's the ruse that gets him in the door?
it makes sense.
during his demonstration, he would have access
to his victims' computers.
on his way out, he asks for a glass of water,
a distraction, something to buy enough time to plant that first camera.
we need to find out what company owns this cable.
detective Fordham's already hunting that down,
and there's an I. D. Number on it, so it shouldn't take long.
we'll have JJ and Reid follow up.
I need you two to track down who was in the chat room.
Garcia finished her sweep?
Yeah. Most were international. 3 were local.
I bet one of them knows the unsub.
we have a warrant.
help you gentlemen?
Yeah, that's me.
we need talk to you about a video you watched last night.
I'm sorry. What video?
this is a warrant for all the computers in your possession.
you're under arrest for accessory to murder.
accessory?
watching a murder happen online and doing nothing about it Is a felony.
I don't know what you're talking about.
what murder?
Yes, this is our cable.
Mrs. Hightower, we went over your records,
and it turns out that none of the 4 victims
signed up with your service.
4? God, those poor women.
we think it's an employee using your cable as a ruse
to get into the house. Can you think of any
uh, he worked on one of our trucks
as we laid the fiber in with the regular phone line.
and you're certain that it's him?
we caught him hoarding it.
he said it was for a home project.
until we got angry phone calls that he was going door to door
offering free fiber-optic installation.
we fired him on the spot.
we need his information.
Absolutely.
ladies and gentlemen, meet Mac Jones.
that isn't the I. D. We got from the phone company.
that's because last year Mr. Jones had his identity stolen.
the unsub took his license and his credit card,
used them for 2 weeks, and then moved on.
now, I can't tell you who the unsub is pretending to be now,
but since a picture's worth a thousand databases,
I can tell you who he was.
robert Johnson, 3-time loser,
arrested for possession of torture videos.
spent some time in a halfway house before he disappeared.
I found a blog of his online. Here's a quote
next time you won't be able to stop me.
that's his narcissism again.
furious that he got caught and he remakes himself as a killer.
it allows him to free the impulses that were always there.
Garcia, is there a pattern to the identities that he steals?
no. He's really disciplined about it.
once he burns through an identity, he never uses the same one again.
you know how I describe some suspects as being off the grid?
this guy is totally the opposite.
he's all over the grid.
he's manipulating the grid.
and he never stays in one place for very long.
so how do we find out who he is now?
I don't think we're going to.
the man known as Robert Johnson is in the wind. If he's this flexible with his name, his real name, forget it.
but there's another way we can find him.
which is?
his online name,
his hacker handle.
that's the name that matters to him.
wait. Wouldn't he have hundreds of those, too?
most definitely. But remember how I said hackers are loyal?
they stick to certain names.
that's how you identify yourself to other hackers.
that's how the FBI caught me.
so if we find the handle...
I'll get you the unsub. I promise.
look, I wish I could help you find the guy
posting these videos, -But I never visited that website, man. -Right.
maybe somebody broke into my computer or something.
see, Scott, we think it was you.
and we found some pretty interesting movies in your hard drive to back up our theory.
white girls can't hump.
that's nice.
Schindler's fist.
see, this one right here, this is the one that got my attention.
the erotic awakenings of Sandy.
how old was the girl in that video? What was she, 12?
I...
I can explain
shut up!
this is what's weird to me.
most of your files were locked away,
but not the child porn.
we found it in like 5 minutes.
it wasn't password protected or anything.
how does someone who's supposed to be so smart with computers
do something so dumb?
can we cut a deal?
you tell me what I want to know and the maybe we'll talk deal.
before this guy accepts you into the club...
he gives you the illegal stuff.
kids. Torture.
he has to know that you're risking as much as he is.
mutually assured destruction.
you rat him out, he takes you with him.
Yes.
what's his name?
I don't know. We never met.
don't you try and play me, kid.
his online name.
watcher 89.
were there any other names?
not that I could find. I don't like
signing up for porn unless I know who's running it.
Mrs. Prentiss.
agent Prentiss.
there's something else you should know.
he sent out a message.
he said tonight would be the best one yet.
he's attacking tonight?
of course.
he knows you're watching him.
he has to put on an extra-good show.
what's interesting, Mr. Chapman,
the two other men we talked to,
they had a form of collateral on their hard drive.
I'm sorry. Collateral?
hard-core pornography.
illegal. Rough.
I would never look at something like that.
you have all my computers. You must have searched them.
Yes. And we found nothing.
so, can I go?
no.
you see, there's still that nagging question
as to why you were logged on to that chat room last night.
Look...Agent Rossi,
I'm at a loss here.
first of all, I'm all thumbs when it comes to computers.
or you're very good with them
and know how to cover your tracks.
second of all,
my grandkids were at the house last night for a sleepover.
they were in bed by 8: 30.
we were so exhausted, my wife and I were asleep by 9: 00.
please! Ask her. She'll say the same thing.
I don't think I even checked my email last night.
do you know this man?
Yes.
he came into my store a while back.
Why?
uh, he said he liked my website.
which my son designed for me, by the way.
we chatted about appliances,
he bought a few items and left.
did he have a name?
no idea. We talked for 5 minutes.
I'll be right back.
do you believe him?
I believe he doesn't fit the profile of the other voyeurs.
they're good with computers.
they have hacking experience.
Garcia checked out the website.
she said it's crude. You can't even order anything from it.
maybe he's right. Maybe the unsub manipulated him
for something else, used his network as part of his spoofing.
go ahead, Garcia.
watcher 89--I got him.
does he have his own network?
he doesn't need one.
he's got a whole city to leech off of.
he's doing this again tonight.
can you send me a list of networks
he's hacked recently? Those are the potential victims.
I got 20 hits.
all right. Filter out men and families.
he only kills single women. - 8 left.
Garcia, do you have any pictures?
coming your way.
her. She's the one.
Lucy masters. You sure?
she's the only one with facial symmetry that would appeal to him.
this is the FBI! We're coming in.
clear!
she's not here, but her car is.
Hey. It just went on by itself.
that's Lucy masters.
he's recording us.
welcome to the show
Garcia, the unsub is working off Lucy masters' network.
can you tell where the video's being transmitted to?
I can't tell. He's not logged in as watcher 89.
he's not using any of the regular proxy servers.
if I didn't know any better, I wouldn't know that this was him.
damn it!
he's encrypted his connection to the proxies.
there's nothing I can do to help you find him.
what do we see? -Metal walls.
it must be the secondary location where he takes the victims.
wait a minute. Garcia, can you magnify the wall behind her?
Yeah, I can do that.
is that frost on the wall?
it's a walk-in freezer.
and I know where he got it.
we didn't catch you by mistake, did we, Austin?
excuse me?
you said the unsub liked your website,
how it was designed.
but it was your work.
what you can repair, what you can restore for him.
you gave him a place to hide the bodies.
that's not true.
talk to my wife.
I'm home by 6: 00 every night
that's the first thing voyeurs learn.
how to cover their tracks.
how to stalk between the hours of 9: 00 to 5: 00.
that's why there was no porn on your computer.
you had something better.
this is a crime!
I would never do what you're describing.
and even if you don't believe me, my wife knows.
my kids, my grandkids.
I hate computers.
I don't even know how they work.
well, then let me give you your first lesson.
when something goes out on the Internet, it's out there forever.
now, you're going to jail.
that's a foregone conclusion.
but, unless you cooperate with me,
I will do everything I can to make sure
that the next time your grandkids Google you,
they will find out what kind of a monster grandpa really is.
now, I will ask you once
where is the freezer?
1823 Hudson. I got it. We're on our way.
Garcia, it's been 3 minutes since the signal went up live.
Lucy might not have that much time left.
I can buy you some. Now that I've got his physical address,
I got my business all up in his.
no, no, not today.
No!
No!
now, when your Internet goes down,
it ruins your whole day, doesn't it, psycho?
No!
get off her! - Let her go!
get your hands off!
No! Let her go!
No! No! -Lucy.
get the paramedics in here!
OK. Ok. It's over. It's OK.
go, go, go, go.
it's Dorris archer...
and Allison kittridge.
you killed these women for your fans,
but this is where you kept them for yourself, isn't it,
you sick son of a bitch.
what do you see when you look at them?
you'll never understand what I did.
but out there,
my followers...
they understand.
well, too bad there's no wireless in prison.
get him out of here!
the Internet is the first thing "That humanity has built that humanity doesn't understand,"
the largest experiment in anarchy that we have ever had.
Eric Schmidt.
just for the record...
I didn't do this.
this is Dorris Archer, she's the third woman to go missing in Boise, Idaho, this year, along with Paula Renmar and Samantha Rush.
they went missing roughly 2 months apart.
well, hello.
what, did you join a boy band?
no.
OK, so what are we looking at here? Late 20s, early 30s.
all single, though two are in committed relationships.
all living on their own.
looks like normal suburban houses. Gives the unsub privacy.
the differences are more striking than the similarities.
different hair colors, different body shapes.
what do you know about his M. O?
that's why we were invited in.
the abduction sites are pristine.
and there's no dna besides the victims', and there's no sign of forced entry or a struggle.
and the victims aren't reported missing until 2 or 3 days after they're abducted.
2 or 3 days...
women like this don't just vanish without somebody noticing.
Yes. Which is why I asked Garcia to dig into their lives.
and when I took a look at their online activity,
I could easily see how the unsub is doing it.
social networking sites. - Yeah. Facebook, twitter.
you name an online life-sharing time suck, the victims were on it.
and if you look at each of their last posts, they say kind of the same thing...
going out of town, going on a business trip, going on a vacation.
but when you look at the time and date stamp of each of these, cue the "twilight zone" music, because they were all posted the morning after each of them went missing.
the unsub posted them.
social networks are an easy way for an unsub to target his victims.
these women were especially open.
they posted everything from what they were having for dinner to where they were going on dates.
so this unsub friends his victims and then uses that as a cover once he takes them.
that means he can hack into their accounts. So he's excellent with computers.
definitely profiles as patient and organized.
he's obsessive enough to remove all forensic details, but also patient enough to wait 2 months before abductions.
he can afford to be. He gets 3 days to do whatever he wants to these women.
that means we need to assume these women are already dead.
the question is what he does while he has them.
george Bernard Shaw.
so if this unsub is using social networks to find his victims, can't we use that to find him?
Yeah, if these women each had 100 friends following them, then the unsub would pop up on each of their lists, right?
uh, the detective in charge, John Fordham, he looked into their groups.
everyone checked out.
social networking sites are surprisingly insecure.
facebook recently tried to update all their privacy settings, and in doing so, they made everybody's profiles viewable.
can somebody explain to me the appeal of these sites?
eating sushi tonight. Yum.
boss is keeping me late at work. Grr.
whose life is so important that we'd be interested in this kind of detail?
I don't know. I guess that's the running joke, right? I mean, nobody is.
but we'd all like to believe there's actually an audience out there that wants to follow our every move.
you know, some sites actually have a gps feature built in.
you can tell exactly where someone is every time they post a new comment.
this is telling us how he's finding them, but it's not telling us how he's getting into their houses.
at the very least, I believe that he has copies of their keys.
Dorris Archer had a home security system installed, but the disable code was entered at 1: 56 a.m. So he knew that, too.
he also found a way to deal with her dog.
a German shepherd she adopted from the pound last year went missing the night that she did.
all right, so this guy's gotta be in and out of the house well before the night of the disappearance.
he comes up with some ruse, talks his way inside, then once he's familiar enough with the house, he knows he can come back and kidnap them without disturbing anything.
what about the people who come into your house that you don't consider a threat?
home repair guys, dog-walkers.
Yeah, Detective Fordham looked into that, too.
no one even came close to being a killer.
OK, Morgan and Prentiss, start with the last abduction sites.
see if anything point to his M. O.
Dave, you, Reid, and JJ go back over the women's lives.
start with their friends on the social networking sites.
if this is how the unsub is finding them, maybe they're connected to him without even realizing it.
uh, Detective Fordham.
agent Jareau? - Yeah.
uh, these are SSA Hotcher Rossi, and Dr. Spencer Reid. - How do you do?
well, thank you for coming. We can really use your help.
did you find anyone willing to talk to us about the victims?
the problem wasn't who to bring in. It was who not to.
the man we're looking for might have found your daughter through her social networks.
did Paula mention anyone new in her life? - No.
no one who started following her as a friend, someone she didn't recognize?
I don't really know how those work.
someone sent me an email congratulating me on Paula's promotion.
I didn't even know.
and when I asked her, she said, "mom, I put that on my wall last week.
she was gone 2 days later.
Samantha was rigorous about keeping her status updated.
she's obsessed with those sites.
so I'm assuming she knew who followed her, then?
Oh, god, no. She had over 1, 000 friends.
why so many? - We both worked in real estate.
she saw it as the perfect way to promote herself.
so, wait. Even though she told all those people what she was doing, she didn't know who was following her?
you ever have so much email, you feeling like you're drowning in it?
actually, I don't have email. - Seriously?
then let me break it down for you.
these websites are like email on crack.
it's impossible to keep up with everybody.
we just have a few more questions about your girlfriend's disappearance.
did Dorris ever mention letting someone in her home?
like who?
well, we're just trying to figure out who would know the code to her home security.
it must have been someone she trusted with the combination.
no. She was smart. She took precautions.
that's the whole reason she got bruno.
Bruno... The dog. So he was a guard dog?
Yeah. She trained him for like 6 weeks.
OK.
I know these are hard to look at, but do you see anything different?
something he may have done to get himself inside.
this isn't right. - What's that?
the photographs. This is when we first started dating.
the one on the right should be on the left.
OK. And she wouldn't have rearranged them herself?
no. She arranged them a certain way to tell a story.
it was... It was how we fell in love.
OK, JJ, I got it. - You see it?
actually, yeah. Looks like he did try to hang something on the wall.
there's even a little residue left over.
let me call you back. - Yeah.
Yeah, what do you got? - Hey, I got one up here, too.
what would he try to hang on that part of the wall?
well, from here, I have an unobstructed view of the second floor and down the stairs.
it's the same thing down here. You can see the entire entrance.
cameras. He put up cameras.
we think this is what he's using to spy on his victims.
they're small, they're cheap, and they're easily hidden, behind photos, books, or plants.
the footage they record can then be transmitted anywhere.
website of your choice, even your cell phone.
and he can toggle between cameras to see everything that's happening in the house.
and you found 5 of these at different points in the house?
upstairs, downstairs, bedroom, even the bath.
a ruse gets him in the door, but it doesn't buy him enough time to put up 5 of these.
right. That's why we think he starts with one camera facing the front door.
that tells him when it's safe to enter the house, when she comes and goes, when the dog-walker comes, and what the combination to the house is.
it fits his M. O. It he learned their every detail on social networks, he will be just as obsessive in his surveillance.
and once he learns their routine, all he has to do is pick the lock, put up the rest of the cameras, and boom, he got their whole life at his fingertips.
what does he do with the video? Maybe he keeps them?
if he's a voyeur, yes.
Ah, voyeurs are rarely violent.
their excitement comes from spying without the object knowing they're being watched.
and by abducting his victims, he's removing the outlet of his sexual release. Reid is right.
so he must have some other agenda with these cameras.
he might be sharing the footage with other people.
we need to have Garcia dig into surveillance in illegal video websites.
I'm going to take this with us. - Why?
we originally profiled there wasn't any facial similarity between the victims, but I'm not so sure that's true.
I want to compare Dorris' picture with the other victims.
these videos the unsub took, it looks like one of them he posted online, which may help me nab it.
if he puts it on the web, can't you track that back directly to his computer?
normally, yes.
normally, in like in 17 seconds I can get you the network he's using, get a physical address of his modem, and presto change-o, no more bad guy, but this unsub is a creepy computer aficionado.
do you guys know what a proxy server is?
it's an Internet relay.
precisely. Kids use them to get around blocked sites.
now, usually one proxy is plenty, but this piece of work is using dozens of proxy servers.
he's bounced his signal off of China, North Korea, Russia, South Africa...
Garcia, can you trace him back to Boise?
of course I can, and that's what I'm doing?
time is the unfortunate ingredient I need, though.
this just in.
looks like one of the proxy servers archived what he was streaming on the night of Dorris Archer's disappearance.
can we see it? - Pulling it up now.
well, Prentiss and Morgan were right. He knows the house.
and the dog knows him.
Oh, please don't hurt that doggie.
how many trips inside the house would that take? A dozen?
see that?
the camera's attached to him. It's his point of view.
so he can relive it over and over again.
OK, can someone tell me when this is over?
please. - Not yet.
he's tender to her. She means more to him as a corpse than as a living person.
Garcia, we need to find the unsub's network.
even if it's a rough area, it'll help narrow the geographic profile.
Yeah. Sir, that's totally what I'm trying to figure out.
uh, there is something else kind of huge you need to know about.
do you see this line of code there?
Yeah, what about them?
it allows the user admin, and in this case, the unsub, to set up a chat room.
people were watching this on the night of the murder.
we thought he was posting these after the fact. He's not.
he wants people to experience it with him.
he wants an audience.
he has fans.
can you freeze that?
he's acknowledging the camera.
tip of the hat to his fans. He knows they're watching.
classic narcissistic behavior.
he's performing for his audience.
we know the M. O. The question is how.
what kind of job gives him access to the victims' houses?
it has to be network and I. T.s, the guy you let in to hook up your Internet.
gets him in their house and on their computers.
I went through all the women's Internet service providers with a fine-tooth comb.
they all used different companies and no overlap with sales reps.
what about onsite tech support?
Oh, well, clean as a whistle.
they all had alibis with no criminal records.
what I don't understand is, why does he take the bodies with him after they're dead?
Yeah, it'd be one thing if he took them while they were still alive, but he's accomplished his task.
he murders them and he completes the performance.
so why take the risk of carrying a corpse to your car?
well, there must be some postmortem behavior or signature or something we're not seeing.
well, think about that for a second.
he's sharing this murder with a crowd of onlookers.
what could he be doing to these bodies just for himself?
Hey, guys. Garcia's got something for us. Go ahead, baby girl.
OK, friends, I have some good news, but first, here is the thing that sucks.
I located the network the unsub is using in Boise, and it is the victims' own wireless.
so does he hack in before he starts with the murders?
hacking is obscenely time-consuming.
I just make it look easy because I'm a genius. But he's not me.
so my guess is that he's got to lurk around their network for at least a couple of days to a week before he kills them.
that's pretty brilliant on his part.
Yeah, he knows when we follow his online paper trail that it'll lead us right back to the murder site.
what's the good news?
hackers are very loyal to their spoofing techniques, and if they think no one's watching, they'll use the same roads over and over.
OK, so if he goes through Russia, China, and North Korea again...
I have flagged those servers, and if he uses them in the same order, I will catch him so fast.
that's only going to help us if he commits another murder.
Yes, that's also true. - Excuse me.
Garcia, if he does stream this again, how much time will you need to find the network?
Oh, uh, that's hard to guess with all the international pinging. I...
ballpark. - Uh, 7 minutes?
that's not fast enough. He's in and out of the house in 5.
Oh, god. I'm going to have to trim my time down, then.
Garcia, get it done.
JJ, we need to call a press conference.
now that we know how he's killing these women, we need to get it out there.
uh, all right, I'll, uh, prescreen the journalists I call on, - hope we don't get anything out of left field. - Good.
I know what connects the victims.
I was staring at pictures of the victims and I knew there was a pattern connecting them, but I couldn't tell what it was until I broke it down mathematically.
why are we so drawn to celebrity faces?
because there's a symmetry to their beauty...
the eyes, the ears, the ratio of the forehead to the chin.
the more balanced they are, the more appealing they are to our eye.
these women aren't celebrities, though.
no, but there are similarities between them, and it wasn't until I scanned their pictures and got it to the guys at quantico that I had a full breakdown.
all right, strip away eye color, hair color, and skin tone, and what are we left with geometrically?
they're all slightly dystopic.
the left eye is slightly lower than the right eye on all the victims.
all the noses are narrow.
the forehead has the same ridge.
he might not even be aware that he sees it in them.
there have been studies that suggest that we pick our spouses subconsciously, based on a facial symmetry that we recognize.
so consciously or unconsciously, when he recognizes it, he has to destroy it.
which means he only has interest in the bodies as they relate back to him.
maybe... They're a reflection.
remember what he did at the end of the video?
he wiped the tear away.
another act of compassion he's not capable of.
his narcissism prevents him from that.
in the Greek myth, Narcissus was so self-absorbed that he fell in love with his own reflection in the water.
exactly. He finds women with the same face, he strangles them, and then stares at them after they've died.
but whose image does he really see?
his own.
thank you.
most of us take the Internet for granted.
we forget about texts that we share or updates we put on social networks.
but the Internet never forgets.
once it's out there, it's out there forever.
now, we all know about the horrific deaths that get shown on the web.
the murder of a journalist.
the stoning of an Iranian dissident.
those murders are immortal.
and this unsub craves that same immortality.
he recognizes his face on theirs and he kills them as a way of saying, "this is what I look like.
we think this also informs his compulsion to take the bodies with him.
he takes them to a secondary location where we believe he preserves them, so that every time he looks at them, he sees his own ego reflected.
fortunately for us, this means we have a good idea of what he looks like.
based on the shape of the victims' faces, we have a rough composite sketch.
this unsub is an expert with computers and home networks.
so look into criminal records of men with extensive computer training.
we know you've already looked into the victims' computer I. T.settings, so we'd like to expand the search.
look into electronic stores, computer distributors, I.T. Departments where the women worked.
we overuse the term narcissistic in our culture, but we're going back to the psychological definition.
every aspect of this man's life has been constructed around an inflated sense of self.
unsubs like this are particularly vulnerable to what's called narcissistic injury.
if his self-worth is attacked or damaged, he will lash out.
so, if you find this unsub, do not challenge him publicly.
say you just want to talk him, see if he knows anything about the brilliant mastermind who's stalking these women.
under no circumstances should you denigrate him.
as difficult as it is, we need to talk up his exploits as if we respected him.
this is a sketch of the man we're looking for.
he is a white male, roughly 5'10."
he's highly skilled with computers and networks.
we encourage everyone to monitor the information they post about themselves on social networks.
do not document the details of your day.
don't post pictures of yourself, friends, or family.
all right, we'll take some questions. Yeah?
how did the FBI generate this sketch if there were no eyewitnesses?
it's a approximation based on a video we recovered.
OK, yeah, what's your question?
can you comment on the rumor he has some sort of facial symmetry with his victims?
does he look like them?
right now the Boise police are pursuing several theories.
that's not a no.
why would he target women who look like him?
it's too soon to speculate on how or why he chooses his victims.
well, what should people do to protect themselves, change their face?
no, just update your online security and be vigilant about what you post.
all right, we're done with questions. Thank you.
Hotch. Somebody leaked our profile.
the press started asking questions about facial symmetry.
it must have been one of your officers.
look, my guys were checking their cell phones, but that's just habit now.
all right, I can talk to the press independently, I can keep this off the 10: 00 news, but...
I know. It went out live.
well, what are the chances he didn't see it?
not good.
Oh, your crafty little sicko.
sir, it's fantastic you called. I just figured out...
how are you doing on pinning down the networks?
OK, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
remember how I said he was spoofing his signal off different servers?
well, it turns out some of those are a decoy meant to waste my time.
so does that mean you can find him faster?
totally. Totally. I can write a program that filters out the decoys...
Oh, crap. - Is that him?
Yeah. Ok. It looks like I'm gonna have to filter this on the fly.
can you send us the feed? - I think I can intercept it in Ukraine.
he's going live.
look at the way he's moving. He's not slow and deliberate. This guy's pissed.
all right, what do we see? Determining markers.
a one-story cottage. - It could be anywhere.
is there a number on the house?
no, and he's already at the door. - Garcia.
he's using twice as many proxy servers.
wait. This window here on the bottom... Is that the chat room?
there she is. - He's in the house, guys.
he's completely changed his M. O. It is way too early.
there's too much light. What happened?
someone asked the wrong question at the press conference.
Oh, my god, turn around. Just turn around.
maybe she can fend him off.
new kitchen appliances. Can we track them through work orders?
he'll be gone by then. - Garcia, give us something.
I'm stateside now. I'm almost to Idaho. I just need more time.
you're not gonna make it. - Yes, I will. I will. I...
forget the unsub. Can you run a trace on everybody in the chat room?
I can't do both, sir. Let me do this.
Garcia, tag the viewers. That's an order.
baby girl, it's gonna be ok.
no, no, it's not. It's bad enough that there's been so much death around me, but this guy is all up in my turf, and he's really good at what he does for really awful reasons.
that's why you're gonna find the perverts that watched it happen in that chat room, and we'll nail them to the wall and they're gonna give up the unsub.
no, no, that is not good enough. I want to watch him suffer.
I want to watch him bleed.
Oh, god, I just scared myself. - Good. That's a good thing.
because if there's one thing i've learned the hard way is the last person you want to tick off is Miss Penelope Garcia.
that's a compliment, right? - Yes, it is.
we will beat this guy. Believe that.
now, I'll call you when we've got something. - Ok.
her name was allison kittridge, 29. This was her first house.
all right, so this unsub accelerated his timetable and his M. O.
he was moving faster because he was angry.
Yeah. The press conference told him something about himself he didn't like, so he rushed.
which means he made a mistake. Now, what was it?
well, it wasn't the cameras. He remembered to take those with him.
it wasn't the body. He took that with him, too.
Hey, did, uh, Garcia find anything unusual with allison's wireless?
no. Records show that it was a basic DSL installation.
Hey, Prentiss. Help me move this table. - Yeah.
what do you got?
you see this line right here?
Yeah.
this is what brings the Internet from the street into the house.
OK. So? - This isn't DSL.
it's not? - It's a fiber-optic cable.
completely different type of connection.
we just found his mistake.
if there's already an Internet connection in the house, why does he bring his own with him?
is it the upload speed?
fiber-optic allows him to stream large amounts of video.
and maintain a chat room.
that's dozens of computers connected to him at once.
he'd need a lot of bandwidth for something like that.
we checked all the isps. Why didn't he turn up?
I get mail, phone calls, people knock on my door all the time to see if I want to upgrade my Internet.
Yeah, I get them, too.
and they'll offer to come inside and demonstrate how much faster their connection is.
you think that's the ruse that gets him in the door?
it makes sense. During his demonstration, he would have access to his victims' computers.
on his way out, he asks for a glass of water, a distraction, something to buy enough time to plant that first camera.
we need to find out what company owns this cable.
detective Fordham's already hunting that down, and there's an ID Number on it, so it shouldn't take long.
we'll have JJ and Reid follow up.
I need you two to track down who was in the chat room.
Garcia finished her sweep?
Yeah. Most were international. 3 were local.
I bet one of them knows the unsub.
FBI. We have a warrant.
help you gentlemen?
Austin Chapman? - Yeah, that's me.
FBI. We need talk to you about a video you watched last night.
I'm sorry. What video?
this is a warrant for all the computers in your possession.
you're under arrest for accessory to murder.
accessory?
watching a murder happen online and doing nothing about it is a felony.
I don't know what you're talking about. What murder?
Yes, this is our cable.
Mrs. Hightower, we went over your records, and it turns out that none of the 4 victims signed up with your service.
4? God, those poor women.
we think it's an employee using your cable as a ruse to get into the house.
can you think of any... - Mac Jones.
uh, he worked on one of our trucks as we laid the fiber in with the regular phone line.
and you're certain that it's him?
we caught him hoarding it. He said it was for a home project.
until we got angry phone calls that he was going door to door offering free fiber-optic installation.
we fired him on the spot. - We need his information.
Absolutely.
ladies and gentlemen, meet Mac Jones.
that isn't the I. D. We got from the phone company.
that's because last year Mr. Jones had his identity stolen.
the unsub took his license and his credit card, used them for 2 weeks, and then moved on.
now, I can't tell you who the unsub is pretending to be now, but since a picture's worth a thousand databases, I can tell you who he was.
robert Johnson, 3-time loser, arrested for possession of torture videos.
spent some time in a halfway house before he disappeared.
I found a blog of his online. Here's a quote...
next time you won't be able to stop me.
that's his narcissism again.
furious that he got caught and he remakes himself as a killer.
it allows him to free the impulses that were always there.
Garcia, is there a pattern to the identities that he steals?
no. He's really disciplined about it.
once he burns through an identity, he never uses the same one again.
you know how I describe some suspects as being off the grid?
this guy is totally the opposite. He's all over the grid.
he's manipulating the grid.
and he never stays in one place for very long.
so how do we find out who he is now?
I don't think we're going to. The man known as Robert Johnson is in the wind.
if he's this flexible with his name, his real name, forget it.
but there's another way we can find him. - Which is?
his online name, his hacker handle.
that's the name that matters to him.
wait. Wouldn't he have hundreds of those, too?
most definitely. But remember how I said hackers are loyal?
they stick to certain names.
that's how you identify yourself to other hackers.
that's how the FBI caught me.
so if we find the handle...
I'll get you the unsub. I promise.
look, I wish I could help you find the guy posting these videos, but I never visited that website, man.
right.
maybe somebody broke into my computer or something.
see, Scott, we think it was you.
and we found some pretty interesting movies in your hard drive to back up our theory.
"white girls can't hump." That's nice.
Schindler's fist.
see, this one right here, this is the one that got my attention.
the erotic awakenings of Sandy.
how old was the girl in that video? What was she, 12?
I... I can explain...
shut up!
this is what's weird to me.
most of your files were locked away, but not the child porn.
we found it in like 5 minutes.
it wasn't password protected or anything.
how does someone who's supposed to be so smart with computers do something so dumb?
can we cut a deal?
you tell me what I want to know and then maybe we'll talk deal.
before this guy accepts you into the club...
he gives you the illegal stuff. Kids. Torture.
he has to know that you're risking as much as he is.
mutually assured destruction.
you rat him out, he takes you with him.
Yes.
what's his name? - I don't know. We never met.
don't you try and play me, kid.
his online name.
watcher 89.
were there any other names?
not that I could find.
I don't like signing up for porn unless I know who's running it.
Mrs. Prentiss.
agent Prentiss. - There's something else you should know.
he sent out a message. He said tonight would be the best one yet.
he's attacking tonight?
of course. He knows you're watching him.
he has to put on an extra-good show.
what's interesting, Mr. Chapman, the two other men we talked to, they had a form of collateral on their hard drive.
I'm sorry. Collateral?
hard-core pornography. Illegal. Rough.
I would never look at something like that.
you have all my computers. You must have searched them.
Yes. And we found nothing.
so, can I go? - No.
you see, there's still that nagging question as to why you were logged on to that chat room last night.
look... Agent Rossi, I'm at a loss here.
first of all, I'm all thumbs when it comes to computers.
or you're very good with them and know how to cover your tracks.
second of all, my grandkids were at the house last night for a sleepover.
they were in bed by 8: 30.
we were so exhausted, my wife and I were asleep by 9: 00.
please! Ask her. She'll say the same thing.
I don't think I even checked my email last night.
do you know this man?
Yes. He came into my store a while back.
Why?
uh, he said he liked my website.
which my son designed for me, by the way.
we chatted about appliances, he bought a few items and left.
did he have a name? - No idea. We talked for 5 minutes.
I'll be right back.
do you believe him?
I believe he doesn't fit the profile of the other voyeurs.
they're good with computers.
they have hacking experience.
Garcia checked out the website. She said it's crude.
you can't even order anything from it.
maybe he's right. Maybe the unsub manipulated him for something else, used his network as part of his spoofing.
go ahead, Garcia. - Watcher 89... I got him.
does he have his own network?
he doesn't need one. He's got a whole city to leech off of.
he's doing this again tonight.
can you send me a list of networks he's hacked recently?
those are the potential victims.
I got 20 hits. - All right. Filter out men and families.
he only kills single women. - 8 left.
Garcia, do you have any pictures?
coming your way.
her. She's the one. - Lucy Masters. You sure?
she's the only one with facial symmetry that would appeal to him.
Lucy Masters? - This is the FBI! We're coming in.
clear! - Clear!
she's not here, but her car is.
it just went on by itself.
that's Lucy Masters.
he's recording us.
welcome to the show.
Garcia, the unsub is working off Lucy Masters' network.
can you tell where the video's being transmitted to?
I can't tell. He's not logged in as Watcher 89.
he's not using any of the regular proxy servers.
if I didn't know any better, I wouldn't know that this was him.
damn it! He's encrypted his connection to the proxies.
there's nothing I can do to help you find him.
what do we see? - Metal walls.
it must be the secondary location where he takes the victims.
wait a minute. Garcia, can you magnify the wall behind her?
Yeah, I can do that.
is that frost on the wall?
it's a walk-in freezer. - And I know where he got it.
we didn't catch you by mistake, did we, Austin? - Excuse me?
you said the unsub liked your website, how it was designed.
but it was your work.
what you can repair, what you can restore for him.
you gave him a place to hide the bodies.
that's not true. Talk to my wife.
I'm home by 6: 00 every night...
that's the first thing voyeurs learn.
how to cover their tracks.
how to stalk between the hours of 9: 00 to 5: 00.
that's why there was no porn on your computer.
you had something better.
this is a crime!
I would never do what you're describing.
and even if you don't believe me, my wife knows.
my kids, my grandkids.
I hate computers. I don't even know how they work.
well, then let me give you your first lesson.
when something goes out on the Internet, it's out there forever.
now, you're going to jail.
that's a foregone conclusion.
but, unless you cooperate with me,
I will do everything I can to make sure that the next time your grandkids google you, they will find out what kind of a monster grandpa really is.
now, I will ask you once...
where is the freezer?
1823 Hudson. I got it. We're on our way.
Garcia, it's been 3 minutes since the signal went up live.
Lucy might not have that much time left.
I can buy you some. Now that i've got his physical address,
I got my business all up in his.
no, no, not today.
No! No!
now, when your Internet goes down, it ruins your whole day, doesn't it, psycho?
No!
get off her! Let her go! Get your hands off! - No!
let her go! - No!
Lucy. - Get the paramedics in here!
OK. Ok. It's over. It's ok.
go, go, go, go.
it's Dorris Archer...
and Allison Kittridge.
you killed these women for your fans, but this is where you kept them for yourself, isn't it, you sick son of a bitch.
what do you see when you look at them?
you'll never understand what I did.
but out there, my followers... They understand.
well, too bad there's no wireless in prison.
get him out of here!
the Internet is the first thing that humanity has built that humanity doesn't understand, the largest experiment in anarchy that we have ever had.
Eric Schmidt.
just for the record...
I didn't do this.
a heat advisory has been issued for Los Angeles and Orange Counties.
temperatures reached 110 in the inland valleys, creating increased power demands.
city and county officials have declared shifting blackouts on a rotating basis.
LADWP spokeswoman Karen Cramer announced...
what if it doesn't come back on?
it's only going to be off from 12: 00 to 3: 00.
Yeah, that's what they say, but what if they mess it up?
stop.
but, honey, it's so--- serious.
it can't get any hotter.
what are you doing?
it's 102 degrees. - 92 but...
OK.
besides, we're on the second floor.
what was that? - You stay here.
you see anyone?
I'm sorry. - Be quiet.
don't open it. - I'm not going to.
there's no one here.
Oh, god. Oh, god. - Come on, it's the wind. Come on. Come on.
damn it!
Yeah, real funny.
real funny. - I'm sorry.
maybe a garbage can blew over.
maybe a possum or something. - Yeah.
honey. Did you shut the window?
what?
Oh, my God!
Hey, what did Strauss want?
she needs us in Los Angeles.
home invasion homicide last night.
officers found Gregory Everson, 56, beaten, with a GSW to the head.
his wife Colleen was equally beaten and raped repeatedly.
repeatedly? - That's what she reported.
wait, she survived this?
he chose to keep her alive.
an intentional witness.
everything but that points to an organized offender, an experienced one.
was she able to identify him?
she said he was white, with mean eyes and repulsive breath.
rotten inside and out.
did he rape her in front of the husband? - Yeah.
one home invasion rarely warrants Strauss personally sending us out.
no, there's more.
ballistics match a double homicide downtown L. A. 48 miles away.
where 3 days ago, those 2 women were raped and killed.
but last night was in the suburbs.
they're afraid of another night stalker.
alfred Lord Tennyson wrote, "and out of the darkness came the hands that reached through nature, molding men."
this guy's way too good at this to have just started.
he pulled off hours of torture and a homicide without disturbing the neighbors.
and robbed the house.
that could be a habit. - You think he started as a burglar?
if it was just about the killing, he wouldn't bother robbing them.
wait, how did he get in last night?
Mrs. Everson said there was a noise outside their door.
they were outside of their room a few minutes, when they came back, he was there.
he distracted them.
so he could climb through their bedroom window.
I'll have Garcia, see if that M. O. was used in any other home invasions.
well, victimology's all over the map.
3 murders and he managed to kill men, women, old, young, black, white, hispanic.
that's about as random as it gets.
randomness implies a lack of predictability.
I think that's the point.
all the varying people in his message. He wants them all to fear him.
Oh, and they will. Press got a hold of last night's home invasion.
JJ and I will set up at the station.
Dave, you and Reid go visit Mrs. Everson at the hospital.
morgan and Prentiss, the LAPD detectives are waiting for you at the Everson house.
you hear that? - What?
exactly. What's wrong with us that we're at peace at a crime scene?
hotter than hell.
techs must have turned off the a/c.
see?
at peace.
what's the matter, more hot flashes, ma'am?
surprised a hotshot like you doesn't need to cool down.
when are the big guns coming?
what's wrong? You afraid that they'll get all the front pages now?
I never asked for that.
detectives. - Quite a crowd out there.
Matt Spicer. Adam Kurzbard.
Emily Prentiss. This is Derek Morgan.
Hey, thanks for flying out.
so, what have you got? - Got our hands full.
guy's been across the city in a week.
seems completely random.
you don't think it is?
we're Robbery-Homicide in Newton Division.
the first 2 vics were right in the middle of it.
the only thing that brought us all the way out here were the bullets.
and the assault. All the victims were raped.
DNA match? - He covers up.
the, uh, Eversons were in their bedroom upstairs when the electricity went out.
so the unsub cut the power. - No.
they've got rolling blackouts scheduled.
trying to get through this heat wave without the whole city going dark.
so, is that why he came out here?
well, people are afraid of the dark. He probably preyed on that.
OK, so the lights go out and this guy starts banging on the door.
why give them the heads-up like that? Why not just break in?
he probably likes getting their adrenaline going.
makes for a fun fight.
sounds like he got one. Wife's real shook up.
I don't think she's gonna be much help.
why is she in restraints?
she tried to kill herself. Twice.
Mrs. Everson? We're with the FBI.
we know you talked to the detectives this morning.
but if you're up for a few more questions, it could help.
why didn't he kill me?
it -- it wasn't about you.
this man only thinks about power and control.
leaving you behind gives him that.
now... Did he ever speak to you directly?
did he talk to you?
no, he really didn't. I'm sorry.
it's ok. Take your time.
Greg looked at me...
the way he always did. I...
we didn't need words. We...
he just...
looked at me and we would know.
I tried to be strong, but I -- I...
shut my eyes when the gun went off, and...
that's the last thing Greg saw.
now every time I shut my eyes...
I see him.
how long will that last?
you rest now.
Uh-huh, yeah. We'll have him on the 11: 00. Thanks.
Where's Rossi? - He's talking with Hotch and Morgan.
it's incredibly detailed.
Yeah. Detective Matt Spicer and his partner are the go-to guys for robbery-homicide, Central Bureau, Newton Division, the busiest in L. A..
it's Garcia. Hey, Garcia, I got JJ here.
praise the gods. Los Angeles has a weirdly low rate of home invasion burglaries.
I snagged a case in Westchester where a guy violently knocked down the front door, kicked the dog, and took off with the TV.
breaking down the front door sends a message.
he's trying to intimidate the victims.
Yeah, and as horrible as this dog-kicking burglar sounds.
I think the guy we're looking for is even more horrible.
Garcia, this unsub's had practice, a lot of it.
maybe not in L. A., but he's definitely done this before.
word. This is not his first crime party.
I seriously can't find a single case in L. A. that equals this level of emotional destruction.
we need to expand the search to all of Southern California.
he can be in other cities with a quick ride on the freeways.
Yeah. Will do. - Thanks, Garcia.
we're going live on the 11: 00 news.
you think he'll be watching? - It's late. He could already be hunting.
do you ever look at why this victim, why this day, why this crime?
always.
do you ever think they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time?
sometimes.
well, I don't believe in coincidences. - How come?
don't get me wrong. It's not like I talk to the universe or anything.
I've just always believed that things happen for a reason.
it's hard to find the reason for this, though.
utterly meaningless crimes, no obvious motivation. Pure evil.
evil can't be scientifically defined.
it's an illusory moral concept that doesn't exist in nature.
its origins and connotations have been inextricably linked to religion and mythology.
this offender has shown no signs of any belief.
I'm, uh, I'm Spencer Reid.
the media's been asking for you.
Yeah, well, nobody else around here wants to talk to them.
I figure it hasn't hurt me yet.
uh, they'd like to interview you for the 11: 00 news.
can we go over a few points? - Absolutely.
the first 2 victims earlier this week?
downtown. Killed about 2 A. M.
we found them when the sun came up.
not at noon? - Right. Vice were over there about 6 A. M.
both these clocks are stopped at 12: 00.
was there a blackout?
they started last night.
so then he cut their power.
but he let the city do it last night.
Where's the next rolling blackout?
if you're driving through the San Fernando Valley, beware -- the power in Glendale has just gone out, thanks to the rolling blackouts.
stay tuned for further details.
now let's take a look at the weather.
well, the heat is not gonna break anytime soon, with temperatures still hovering at 97 degrees.
look for overnight lows to be about 90, same situation for tomorrow...
Oh, come on.
OK, sweetie, we're home.
officers arrived at the home of Annie Danzi just after 11: 00 this morning...
this time a young child was left behind.
LAPD investigator Matt Spicer is the lead on this case...
held by the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit later this morning.
the profilers arrived in Los Angeles last night.
we're going live now to Annie Danzi's home. We've been told the FBI has just arrived.
agent Jareau. Agent Jareau.
this is the second home invasion homicide that started since the blackouts.
will you confirm that they're connected?
how are you going to keep the residents safe in these areas?
we're working close with city officials and LAPD to determine what steps we need to take to ensure everyone's safety.
will they call off the blackouts?
not at this time.
Annie Danzi. 30, single mom.
was her child home?
Spicer's with him now.
so the power was out 10: 00 to 1: 00?
all the same tricks.
forced entry? - No.
were there rolling blackouts last summer?
Oh, just about every year.
anything like this happen?
well, crime always goes up when it's hot and dark, but this?
no way.
hunting in the dark is definitely a part of his signature.
Garcia. - Yes, sir.
I need you to check if there were any clusters of home invasions in previous summers during rolling blackouts in California. Look statewide.
he left a message this time.
hello THER
a first time for everything.
you think he's welcoming us?
who knows?
at least he's telling us more with each crime scene.
uneducated. - Made the kid watch.
sadistic.
trashes the place even though there's not that much to steal.
angry.
chooses to hunt and kill in the dark.
doesn't want to be seen. Why?
maybe he's ashamed of something.
well, he didn't have to knock those over.
he doesn't want any eyes on him.
except the kid.
didn't want him to miss a thing.
what you got there? Is that a robot?
it's a monster.
monster, huh? What's it doing?
it's protecting you, right?
it's gonna make the man stay away.
did you happen to get a look at that man?
or was it too dark under the bed?
he moved me to the closet.
and my mom told me to close my eyes.
would you mind showing me how you did that?
that's good, kid. That's really, really good.
so you didn't see him at all?
once that man left, what did you do? Did you get back under the bed?
I didn't want to leave her.
but you were scared.
Hey, Carter, do you, um, do you have like a really cool backpack you could throw some things in to take over to your cousin's house?
it's in my room. Will you come with me?
you bet.
look, I'm really glad the kid didn't see anything, but it could have been helpful.
but covering his eyes like that, that means he couldn't cover his ears.
forcing a child to witness this is clearly sadistic.
he destroyed the boy's innocence and took away his childhood.
this probably mirrors the unsub's own experience.
that's an excuse for what he's doing?
there's no excuse for what he's doing.
we're not justifying anything.
everything he says, everything he does tell us what makes him tick, that's all.
the message that he left us was misspelled, which says that he was not well-educated.
why did he leave one now? - That we don't know -- yet.
just because his recent attacks are in Los Angeles doesn't mean he's from here.
killing in the dark is a must for him. We believe that's why he's come to L. A..
that and his willingness to kill random people tells us that he's an opportunistic offender, and these types are incredibly difficult to predict.
and as you all know, the rolling blackouts have been announced so residents can prepare for the few hours they'll be in darkness.
unfortunately, that also tells the killer whose windows will be open, whose alarms will be disarmed.
the dark is his signature.
it's a habit, and we'll find that he's always killed this way.
cause he's a coward.
to some degree, yes. He also has intimacy issues.
he even turns photographs away from himself.
it's unlikely that a man like this has been in any kind of relationship.
there's also a good chance that he has some type of shortcoming.
whether real or perceived, he's obviously self-conscious about something.
like what? - It could be like a physical deformity.
it might be something really small to us, but it means everything to him.
people just want to fit in.
having one thing that sets him apart from the norm could be what led him into the extreme solitude of a violent schizoid personality.
he takes his victims' power away, literally and figuratively.
and he feeds off of making them powerless.
we had rolling blackouts all last summer, and this guy wasn't around.
well, he is now.
and based on the vicious nature of his crimes, the press has named him the prince of darkness.
prince. That'll fuel his ego.
Yeah. He's gonna be all over the news.
once we unravel his need for darkness, we'll find him.
what if he comes back?
he won't. He can't hurt you again, ok?
how do you know? You didn't find him.
you're right. But I will.
she should have known better.
who? Your mom?
she tried to fight him, but he had a gun.
why did she do that?
well, she need to protect you, Carter.
the man who did this, he's very bad, ok?
I'm going to find him. I promise. Ok?
all right.
thank you.
Yeah, Prentiss. What's the plan?
rolling blackouts are still scheduled for tonight.
how's LAPD gonna patrol it?
with the number of calls they've been getting, they're stretched thin already.
well, then they gotta cancel it.
that's the battle.
if they do that, the whole city could go dark if the power grid gets overwhelmed.
Yeah, you're right. That's not gonna work.
LAPD's outnumbered 10, 000 to 1.
all right, keep me posted.
did you tell her that we're gonna need to talk to Carter again tomorrow?
he won't remember anything.
we have psychological markers, things that could help him out.
you want to make him relive it?
if it will help us catch this guy, yes.
I mean, you saw him. He feels helpless, weak.
there's nothing he could have done about it, but he's gonna keep blaming himself.
you know, Carter didn't reveal that much.
how come you know all this?
because when I was a kid, I lost my parents.
how? - Drunk driver.
and you were in the car? - No.
you seem to have some insight, as if you witnessed it.
maybe because I pictured it a thousand times.
my parents...
they, uh, they were racing home 'cause I was sick.
you know, if they hadn't left right then, they would have missed that intersection, and there wouldn't have been a red light.
I lost my father when I was 9 years old.
he was shot and killed right in front of me.
there was nothing I could do.
so I choose to look at it like this -- we all have people in our lives.
some of them are good. Some of them are bad.
but they shape us, detective.
that's why you have that badge.
that's why the two of us are sitting in this car right now.
how's the boy?
he's quiet. - Too soon for an interview?
Yeah, I want to find this guy before we have to put the kid through it.
guys, Garcia has something.
OK, everybody needs to sit down 'cause I'm about to rock your world and not in a way I like to do it.
I have scoured and searched and you were totally right.
this unsub has been doing it forever.
there is nowhere he hasn't been in the last 26 years.
honestly. Every single state. Well, 48 continental.
my point -- he is the worst I've ever seen, and we have all seen some things.
how did you connect him?
everything you said. He's drawn to the dark.
he shows up during a blackout, he robs, he kills, he leaves a witness.
how's he getting away with this?
he never hits the same city twice. - Except Los Angeles.
I'm sending everything your way and you better load up that printer, 'cause it looks like he started in Southern California way back in the summer of 1984.
thank god the press hasn't connected this.
the Summer Olympics were in Los Angeles that year.
so was Richard Ramirez. That's the year he started.
well, he never left. Stayed in L. A. for a few years.
fine. I'll look into it.
it appears our unsub started that summer during a blackout in San Diego.
from there he went to Orange County.
after that he ended up in Los Angeles and then worked his way up the coast.
why did he come back? - And why now?
it's gonna be hot again tonight.
you might be better off sleeping in your car or just getting the hell out of L. A..
anything to get away from the darkness and what happens in it.
all right, we're about to lose Arcadia.
they've got that 9: 00 to midnight shift.
chatsworth, you're gone from 10: 00 to 1: 00.
check us out online for a full list.
we'll be here until midnight or I guess until the lights go out.
Hey, look at that. It's a cool 99 degrees here at 99. 6.
get here about 10: 15?
listen, I want you to check the neighborhood, see if there are any surveillance cameras.
they may not be working --- Kurz.
Thanks.
did he leave a message?
the son of a bitch left a baby in there.
alive? - Yeah. A baby?
Yes, sir. Thank you very much.
Hey, what's up? - Everyone will have power tonight.
they called off the blackouts?
after what happened earlier, we can't give them that again.
great, I'll tell the press. - Thanks.
we're talking over 200 houses in 26 years.
when he started in San Diego, it was all about the robberies.
by the time he got to Orange County, he robbed and assaulted his victims.
first murder was in Long Beach and he left a witness.
he got away with it for 26 years. Why did he come back?
good news, everybody. The lights are back on.
that's right. The prince of darkness is gonna have to take the night off.
still no suspects in the blackout murders, but investigators believe there's a reason why he's stayed in Los Angeles despite the publicized investigation.
Thanks.
well, the media coverage actually helped.
neighbors were hypervigilant.
as soon as they heard the gunfire they called the police.
did he leave a message this time?
he actually left a baby in the closet.
there's got to be some kind of message in that.
he's taunting us. He's leaving behind witnesses that are too little to help.
OK.
why them? Why now?
he killed these two women before the rolling blackouts.
what is it about them?
he killed them in a busy, well-lit area.
it was nothing like the others.
it's, uh, shootin' Newton.
people hear gunfire down there all the time.
he probably fit right in.
it was in your division.
Hey, he had to start somewhere.
so you think it's just a coincidence?
all right, let's say it's not.
what does that mean, he wanted our attention?
well, he certainly has it.
you're sure you never working anything like this before?
trust me, this guy makes an impression.
he started his career 26 years ago.
same as me.
you think this is because of me?
that all these people are dead because of that?
two women killed in your division, no survivors.
then a couple, leaving the wife as a witness.
then a mother, leaving the son.
now two parents, but a baby survives.
if there's some kind of pattern, I've never seen it before.
he circled back to L. A. for a reason.
the first two murders here in L. A. County were close by.
long Beach is on the cusp of L. A. and Orange Counties.
let's look into that one.
home invasion. A husband was shot. Wife was left alive.
sounds familiar. - What's the next one?
after Long Beach, he went to Santa Monica.
wait a minute. Spicer, do you have family out there?
Yeah, that's where I grew up.
home invasion robbery, double homicide.
Joe and Sylvia Spicer were killed. - Those are my parents.
it doesn't make any sense. Let me see that.
they died in a car accident. A drunk driver.
who told you that?
my grandparents.
I remember my grandfather waking me up.
I was sick the night they died. I had a fever.
how would I not remember that happening to them?
maybe your grandparents never told you, Matt.
they were trying to protect you.
they lied?
you were the first child he left alive.
you've been all over the news.
this guy knows who you are.
this is crazy.
look, when Carter said that the unsub made him watch from the closet, you flinched.
and you didn't?
this guy is taunting you.
he left a young boy alive and now a baby.
he wants you to know it's him.
how could I not know?
you did. Deep down.
but you went through a major trauma as a kid.
you believed the story because it was easier.
and now what?
you want to make me remember what really happened?
I mean, come on, it was 26 years ago.
what good is that gonna do?
it's your call.
is this, you know, like hypnosis or something?
no.
I'm just gonna try and trigger some memories by walking you through what happened that night.
all right.
should I, uh, close my eyes or...
if you want. I just want you to try and relax.
OK.
here we go.
it was July. And it was hot.
were the windows open?
Yeah.
and, uh, there was a breeze.
good. Good. That's really good.
what do you hear?
uh, nothing.
are you sure? - Yeah.
Yeah, my grandfather woke me up and he told me about the accident.
slow down. Slow down. Stay with me.
there was a breeze. What did you smell?
Seriously? - Just try.
OK.
what did you smell?
what did I smell?
I don't know.
I smelled the ocean.
my mother's perfume.
Spicer. What?
cigarettes?
this is weird. I smell cigarettes.
did your grandfather smoke?
never.
come on, think. Who was it?
hello there.
he said, "hello there."
that was his first message.
what's he doing?
he's... He's dragging me. I hear my baby sister crying.
I hear my daddy. He's yelling.
get out of here! Don't you touch me, you son of a
he killed my dad. - Please don't hurt my babies.
I can't see his face. - Take me.
it's too dark. She's begging him.
please don't hurt them.
I can't -- I couldn't see, man. I just -- I'm sorry. I couldn't.
OK. No, that's enough. - I'm sorry.
you did enough. You're good.
OK. We cool?
OK, why is he doing this?
he keeps a survivor so that they'll never forget him, but with you, it goes beyond that, because he believes he turned you into the city's hero.
if your parents weren't killed, you might not have become a detective.
Yeah, but how would he know that? It's not like he stayed in L. A..
he's been all over the country.
the press has talked about your history.
he's not a part of it.
and he wants that recognition. He wants everyone to know what he's done to you.
how's he gonna do that? - Is that your daughter?
where is she?
she's with my sister at my house.
as the mercury soars, so do our power needs.
LADWP is warning that critical power levels are being reached and asks that you keep your acus to a minimum so we can keep the lights on in the city.
Ellie's gone. So is his sister.
are they on their way to the station?
the car's still here and the power's cut, so the unsub was definitely here.
where are you going?
we're gonna try his sister's place.
this guy needs privacy.
he didn't leave them here for us to find, which means he took them somewhere.
what's her address? - 1720 Sheridan.
OK, we'll meet you there. - Ok, good.
I don't even know if we're gonna find him there.
you know what? We won't. - What?
this is about you. There's no history at your sister's place.
he probably took them to santa monica to your old house.
Reid, we're stuck in traffic. The lights are out.
Yeah, it's out here, too. Working off generators.
pretty sure it's citywide.
that's Morgan on the other line.
we're gonna meet him at Kristin's house.
let's get .
ds with a population of 8 million people, it's only a matter of time before the cell phone reception goes
Reid? Are you -- Oh, great.
Spicer, we really should be waiting for backup.
we don't have time. There's a door around back. I'll check that.
where is he?
take me. Take me. Take me.
daddy, help.
drop it.
you first. You first.
drop the gun!
please, daddy, listen, daddy. Listen to him.
don't let him hurt me.
Spicer, don't do it. He doesn't kill children. You know that.
he doesn't kill children. You know that.
you sure about that?
just put it down, matt.
put the gun down or she dies.
don't give in to him, man.
he's not gonna hurt you unless you surrender.
don't do it. Don't do it.
please. Daddy, daddy, he's squeezing me.
I can't -- I can't breathe. Breathe, breathe.
put that gun down, you lose. He will kill you.
look at him. He's nothing but a coward!
daddy, it hurts.
daddy, daddy, daddy... - Ok. Ok!
No! No! No, pick it up!
pick it up!
on your knees.
don't do it! Don't do it!
that's a good boy.
hello there.
your sister grew up real pretty.
last time I saw her, she was just an itty-bitty thing.
not as good as your mom, though.
she squirms too much.
go to hell.
come on, man!
get up! Get up!
Yeah, ok.
think they'll remember me now?
daddy.
you've destroyed me. Is that what you want to hear?
well, it's... Better.
promise me she'll be ok, Morgan.
go ahead, promise him.
do it and promise him!
promise me, Morgan. - Ok!
I promise.
I love you, Ellie.
No! Spicer! What is wrong with you?
take me, please.
Oh, god, no! - No! No!
I don't usually take much to kids.
this one's... Just... Special.
we will find you, you sick son of a bitch.
is that another promise?
please! Please, help!
Ellie! Oh, my god, Ellie, no! I will find you!
19-year-old Kate Joyce, an honor student, was vacationing at the beach with friends when she disappeared nearly 3 days ago.
atlantic beach Detective Bob mathias...
they've had suspects in custody the whole time, but nothing.
can't even charge them with anything unless they find her body.
what are the chances of that?
...but are cooperating with the investigation.
Mathias says without a body... - They're still in Hotch's office, huh?
it can't be good.
...are suspected in her disappearance.
authorities only have 12 hours left to hold the men in custody without an official charge.
JJ's still in there?
and Strauss.
Oh, again with the dairy?
I can't help it. I love dairy.
it's been, like, what, 20 minutes?
well, 10 more minutes, we're in the air.
I don't think it's about the case.
do you know something?
do I know something?
she just repeated the question. You always say that's a sign.
do you know why JJ's in there?
I have no idea.
what is going on? - Maybe she asked for a raise.
have his blinds ever been closed?
I have given it thought. I'm not interested.
clearly.
you turned down the job twice without consulting your unit chief.
agent Jareau is under no obligation to discuss it with me.
if the Pentagon calls one of your team members, you should know about it.
why didn't you tell Agent Hotchner that you turned down the position?
I never wanted it to get this far because -- because you know it's a better job.
because I don't want to leave this one.
you've been here for 6 years.
nearly 7, ma'am. - Change is good.
and from what I understand, there's less travel with this position.
you could stay home with Henry.
excuse me?
I understand the sacrifices.
I do what I love.
it's made me a better person, a better mother.
any "sacrifices" I have made have been for my family.
I don't have a single regret.
we're all in agreement that Agent Jareau's a valuable part of this team, and it's understandable why the executive branch is requesting a transfer.
however, if Agent Jareau respectfully declines their request, there's no way you can make her go.
no, I can't.
have you looked at the video of the missing girl?
everyone's watching it now.
you're expected in Maryland within the hour.
we'll be there.
thank you.
JJ. Pentagon?
sorry I didn't tell you.
it's ok. It's just-- it's a big deal.
a liaison for the department of defense -- it's a major promotion.
are you sure you don't want this?
Hotch, I belong here.
you'd think profilers would cover better than that, wouldn't you?
you read up on the suspects?
presents like the typical dominant/submissive, but I doubt it's that textbook.
well, we only got one shot at this.
how long have they been in custody?
60 hours.
we have 12 hours to get a confession or find the body.
Syd Pearson has a lot of money and connections. If we let him go, we may never see him again.
and Barrett?
he doesn't have the same resources.
do you think these guys did it? - The locals do.
they tried to get them to turn against one another, but that didn't work.
it seems they have a Bond that dates back to childhood.
we only have a 30-minute flight. That's not enough time to delve into their histories.
bullet points on the missing woman. Second and third pages are all about the suspects.
Garcia, we're gonna need phone records, credit card receipts, anything you can find.
Yes, you'll have them when you get back.
thank you.
is everything ok?
what, you mean Strauss?
don't. I know that look.
everything's going to be fine.
Jean Racine said, "a tragedy need not have blood and death."
it's enough that it all be filled "with that majestic sadness that is the pleasure of tragedy."
Hey, you ok? - Uh, yeah. You?
I just feel kind of sick. Excuse me.
I got this offer from the Pentagon. I turned it down twice. I never told Hotch or Strauss.
and now Strauss wants you to take it.
well, of course she does. It'll make her look good if you get promoted.
I don't trust her for a second.
you shouldn't. What does Hotch think?
he knows I don't want to go.
well, then you won't.
Penelope's pretty freaked out, huh?
you have to ask?
OK, let's review.
OK. Kate Joyce, 19 years old, was last seen leaving a bar with these two men,
sydney Pearson and James Barrett, both 20 years old.
she was reported missing the next morning when she didn't meet her friends.
that was almost 3 days ago.
their story is they dropped Kate at the motel, but there were no cameras to confirm that.
and search and rescue's been all over the island.
dragged the inlet and they found absolutely nothing.
both said they had sex with Kate. They're claiming it was consensual.
there's no way to confirm. There's no body.
I doubt it was consensual.
we've got to prove they're guilty of more than just being seen with her.
well, the police weren't able to find any holes in their stories.
we're gonna have to break them down psychologically.
Morgan, I want you and Prentiss to lead the interrogation.
Dave, you and Reid start at the bar.
JJ, Kate Joyce's family is still at the station.
still? For 3 days?
they never went to the hotel.
I want you to stay with them.
Yeah.
they haven't left.
the mayor personally set them up with a penthouse suite at the Harrison grand, but they won't go.
they can't. You're their only source of information.
to be even a minute away would add to their torture.
I've kept them away from the suspects. Now, I don't get why you want them together.
trust me.
you're from the FBI? - Yes, ma'am. Jennifer Jareau.
Kate was almost Jennifer.
Jennifer Joyce. We would have called her JJ.
would you two like to head to the hotel?
I'll come with you. We'll have constant contact with my team.
will those boys still be here?
Yes, sir.
then so will I.
OK, well, let's find a place where we can talk. Come on.
hit the national news yesterday.
a lot of pressure.
the mayor would rather have a great white attacking than a homicide.
sure. A shark attack makes the mayor a victim.
a killer makes him responsible.
once she got into that car, we have no idea what happened.
well, the suspects' stories hold up.
they've told them dozens of times without variation. There's got to be some truth in them.
Syd Pearson is a handful.
Jimmy Barrett is dumber than a box full of rocks.
but they've been friends all their lives.
Yeah, go figure.
there's gotta be a reason.
well, they've only been out of their holding cells to be interrogated or to use the John.
you've got video?
Yeah, we got cameras in both rooms.
good. We'll have to rely on nonverbal cues.
that'll expose their weaknesses.
Hey, you.
What'd you do with Kate? - Calm down, man.
I will kill you, you understand?
you understand me?!
keep them him from me.
Barrett avoided conflict. Pearson was provocative.
the blond one's getting off on this.
well, if he knows where Kate is, that's his power.
Hey, can I get you anything?
what?
water? Soda? Are you hungry?
starving.
anything.
Tuggie's roast beef with fries.
the Curly ones. - You got it.
and a beer.
nice try.
what the hell was that?
just trying to establish some trust.
you gonna ask the other one, too? - No.
in other words, you're not going in there.
not yet.
Really?
you know, we don't have a whole lot of time here.
they've been slammed with the same questions for the last 2 days.
we go in there with that strategy, we'll get nowhere.
I don't get it. - If we go in there now, they have all the power.
so, what, we just wait?
for a while.
Kate Joyce comes from a stable family.
she went to good schools, got good grades, has good friends.
everything points to her being a total sweetheart.
you don't think she is? - I'm sure she is.
But?
she's 19.
everyone agrees -- kate wouldn't leave with those boys.
but she did.
Yeah. But why?
why would this girl, this sweetheart, take such a risk?
we don't have many images to go by.
we saw enough to know what happened.
Kate Joyce and her friends moved around a lot.
the suspects didn't.
they waited for her.
a Sea of opportunity.
why was she drawn to those guys?
- Her friends as if she knew. I never said that.
she was only here a week.
I think she trusted them.
Why?
she may have been testing her boundaries, but she's far too cautious to just go off with total strangers.
so she met them before Friday night.
look at her.
has she always been a fish?
we started her out in swim lessons our second summer down here.
when was that, Jeff,'95?
who's this? Your son?
drew.
so they were on the same swim team, but he looks like he's a few years younger?
was. He had leukemia.
I'm so sorry.
Katie was always very protective of him.
it hit her the hardest.
we should have been here. If we had driven down...
then she wouldn't have come. - Stop saying that.
it's the truth. The whole point was for her to get away.
get away? From what, Patty? From us?
I don't know, Jeff. She needed a break.
you shouldn't have let her come.
she's 19 years old. How was I gonna stop her?
and we said it was ok. - We were wrong.
God, don't you think I know that?!
I know you're trying to make sense of this.
trust me, there is no logic to any of it.
no. You have no idea, no idea what it's like.
our children were taken from us!
and there is nothing you can say that will change that.
you're right.
it's natural to want to blame someone.
but right now you really have to hold on to each other.
Garcia, what have you got?
oodles of records.
cell phones, credit cards, some juicy juvie. Sending details now.
it is safe to say these two have always been in trouble.
when did it start?
the summer of 2000.
they were only 10. What did they do?
see for yourself.
naughty boys.
shoplifting, vandalism, burned a house down.
abandoned building. Fireworks.
assault charges were dropped last summer.
well, it looks like they bring out the worst in each other.
ready?
what's up? - What's up?
my name's Derek Morgan.
I'm with the FBI's behavioral analysis unit.
what did you do?
Oh, I had this before Friday night.
that's not what I asked you.
but I know what you're thinking.
I highly doubt that.
division one lacrosse player.
obviously left-handed.
broke it in 3 places.
that sucks.
I bet you're a force.
too bad you didn't dominate the way they hoped, though.
why not?
I mean, what happened? Were you still hung up on the chapel hill rejection?
I mean, especially after you told everybody that you were gonna go.
I mean, damn, that's gotta sting a little bit.
what's the deal?
isn't it all in your little file?
well, let's see. My little file says...
you cheated on your SATS and you had your girlfriend take them for you.
that's another hard lesson, isn't it?
you can't trust anybody to keep their mouth shut.
why haven't you lawyered up?
I haven't done anything wrong.
that is so annoying.
do you know anything about video cameras?
the battery's probably dead.
Hey, guys. Can I get a new, uh, battery for the video camera?
OK.
what is that, roast beef?
did anyone ask you?
I'm not hungry. - Neither was I until I smelled that.
sorry.
OK.
um... So Syd has a Lexus. That's nice.
did he ever let you drive it? - No.
Yeah, he's kind of a control freak, huh?
I met him. He seems like a jerk.
and it says a lot that he can eat at a time like this.
and he didn't just get a car.
he got a Lexus.
at 16.
but, well, I guess that's what lrbs get.
little rich boys.
his dad's got a dealership.
do you always defend Syd?
defend him?
never mind.
so I see you have a boat.
single outboard motor, two-stroke engine.
is it fast?
Yeah. 25... 30.
so, when did your family move here?
I don't remember.
grade school? Middle school?
fifth grade.
so you were 10.
that's the year you met Syd.
how does any of this have to do with that girl?
he never mentions her by name. - Why not?
he's distancing himself.
depersonalizing the victim.
you want to talk about Kate?
I didn't know her.
you brought her up.
see the way he shifted his weight and cracked his neck?
his behavior was consistent until Kate was mentioned.
your statement says that you and Jimmy first met Kate on Friday night.
these are Kate's credit card receipts.
her and her friends rented a jet ski from Jimmy Friday morning.
he gets 100 customers a day.
Yeah, but come on, man.
I doubt they all look like Kate, now, do they? Hmm?
isn't that really why Jimmy texted you Friday morning?
woke you up and said, hey, man, you gotta get down here and see this girl.
and you liked what you saw, didn't you?
you invite her to the club, and maybe that would have been all right, but the problem is, when you and Jimmy get together, it's nothing but trouble.
and when you add a girl to that mix, she didn't stand a chance, did she?
just like kelley graybeal.
who? - Last summer.
she filed a complaint, but lucky for you she dropped all the charges.
look, man, we could do this for another, I don't know, whatever you got left...
or, I could make it... Real simple for you.
give me a polygraph.
after 65 hours of sitting in here, you want a polygraph?
well, that depends. - On what?
are you gonna ask me the questions?
cause I was really hoping you'd send that pretty one back in here.
you guys hear that? Barrett just asked for a polygraph.
you're kidding me. Him, too?
I don't understand why those boys agreed to a polygraph.
they didn't. They suggested it.
it's a countermeasure.
they're trying to manage perceptions trying to prove they don't have anything to hide.
they know where Kate is right now.
well, we don't know that for sure.
all right, um...
why don't we head to the hotel, ok?
we could go and look at the ocean.
I can't believe you're thinking about a view right now.
I'm not.- You just said
because it calms you. - Ok, you guys haven't been outside for days.
you haven't eaten. You haven't slept. You cannot keep going like this.
you go ahead.
we think Kate was comfortable with these guys.
how? Their only other encounter was at the jet ski rental.
the only documented encounter.
Garcia's running her friends' credit cards, too.
they could have met someplace else.
I don't know. She's a smart girl.
well, they're handsome, charming, 19.
you remember 19?
she would know better than to be outnumbered.
what if Pearson promised to dump Jim Barrett?
and, what, Jim retaliated?
I could work that theory.
when do we get the results?
any minute.
so, what if they didn't do it?
then we're back to nothing? - One of them knows where Kate is.
how can you be sure?
because an innocent person doesn't sit quietly for 3 days.
they get angry and defensive.
these guys are going out of their way to appear calm and in control.
they've got something to hide.
then why take the polygraph?
cause they're stalling. Serial killers are kings of manipulation.
serial killers?
uh, there's only one potential victim.
serial killing is a qualitative characteristic. It not just about numbers.
they've assaulted at least one girl before. It was only a matter of time before they did it again.
Barrett's a perfect match for Pearson.
his family uprooted from the city, forcing him to adapt to his new surroundings.
he's eager to fit in and quick to follow.
and Pearson's definitely got the dominant traits.
he's loud, he's physical, he's smart, he's charismatic, and he's privileged.
sounds like a peach. - You should talk to him.
love to. - I'll take you to him.
JJ, how are the Joyces doing?
they lost their son 3 years ago.
if we can't find Kate...
if Kate knew these boys better than we thought, you might want to dig a little.
dig? - If the family thinks it could help, they may reveal something.
I know. It's just... They shouldn't have to.
Hotch, we can't lose her.
Strauss thinks we're all replaceable.
I went over her head to try to explain that we're not.
are you the bad cop?
I'm not a cop.
a name like that didn't come with manners?
a gentleman walks a Lady to the door.
she wasn't much of a Lady. - Watch your mouth.
the girl was horny, man.
I mean, she practically begged me for it.
that's a bunch of bull -- The son of a bitch passed.
how? How'd you do it?
bastard believes his lies are the truth.
takes a few deep breaths and passes.
old-timer's kind of dramatic, isn't he?
you know, it's actually much simpler than that.
you see, uh, I didn't actually do anything to her.
you didn't do anything?
you gave me some pretty graphic details.
Oh, don't get me wrong.
my DNA is... All over that girl, but, uh, that doesn't mean I killed her.
I got pictures.
what? - On my cell.
you want to see?
you're giving us consent?
give me this guy's property! Now!
what the hell was that? - That was the camera.
no, the yelling. - That was Agent Morgan.
Barrett, it says here you were half an hour late to work on Saturday morning.
I was hung-over.
Hung-over? That's nothing new, but being late is.
it looks like you always clock in 10 minutes early, gas up the jet skis, get the life vests out.
what happened that morning?
I just told you. I was hung-over.
got you. Hung-over, slept in.
what about Friday night, Friday after the bar?
we drove to the inlet.
drove to the inlet. Approximately what time would you say you drove to the inlet?
2: 00, 2:30.
why would you go to the water at 2: 00 or 2: 30 in the morning?
the boats start coming in.
in the middle of the night the boats start coming in?
Yeah. They fish all night, then they bring in the catch.
then they sell it on the docks to the restaurants and all that.
Syd wanted to show her, then he drove her back, dropped her off at the hotel, and the next thing I know, it's morning.
and you slept in?
my alarm clock's broken.
broken. Your alarm clock's broken?
broken.
did it make you upset?
can you fix the damn camera, please?!
sit down.
how'd you pass it?
now, a gentleman never shares, but...
see?
no tears.
now, you see how happy she was?
did Kate drink often?
I told you, she's an athlete.
were you surprised she had a fake I. D?
it's no secret. She liked going out with her friends.
why are you doing this?
I'm not judging Kate. I want to find her.
what time is it?
it's almost dark out.
we can't do this anymore. Please just find her.
where is she? - I don't know.
where is Kate Joyce?
you got a hair or something?
you know what I don't get it, Rossi, what I just can't wrap my brain around?
no, what's that?
how this could have been consensual.
don't sit down. Don't sit down.
consensual, huh?
what does that look like?
how do you get a nice girl like Kate to do both of you in the same night?
she liked it.
what did she like?
what, did she do both of you at once?
come on, you know that.
did you take turns? What?
I mean, you said she liked it. But what? What did she like?
you know, man. - No, I don't.
is this what you did to her? Hmm?
you pin her down?
I told you, she liked it.
you held her just like this.
you choked her.
well, how long before she tapped out?
this is exactly what you did to her.
you know what I think, Syd?
I think Kate didn't want to fool around with your friend.
so she begged you to take her home.
but you couldn't diss your boy like that, could you?
so you helped him.
pinned her down in the backseat.
maybe you threw her out in the dirt.
maybe you hit her too hard, she stopped breathing, you were stuck, weren't you?
it's not true.
is that what you mean by consensual?
they sure know how to run out the clock.
Yeah. What have we got?
less than 3 hours.
what do you think?
well, he's not smart enough to have done this by himself.
he's always been a follower.
Pearson's charming enough to pick up a good girl, but Barrett was just along for the ride.
take a look at the photos.
Oh, she wasn't interested in Barrett at all.
but he's the one she met in the morning.
all right. Well, I'll keep pushing. How's it going in there?
I wouldn't be surprised if Morgan turned off the camera in a minute.
I told you, Agent Jareau's transfer is an executive decision.
ma'am, I'm asking you not to take it out on Agent Jareau because I went over your head.
I know this is emotional for you
it's not emotional. It's a bad decision.
she's a vital member of our team.
I'm afraid it's a done deal.
that's unacceptable.
well, what do you want me to do, Aaron, lose my job so she can keep hers?
and I have no say in this?
you don't get it. They're not asking you.
they want her back in D. C. now.
what do you think?
I don't know. This kid's got no shame. No guilt.
he did horrible things to Kate, but...
I don't think he killed her.
so what are we saying?
the only thing he's guilty of is being a scumbag?
any official charge for that?
the storm came through and separated the land.
that's what made the inlet.
one thing you can trust is the ground beneath you, until one day it all just shifts.
is that some kind of a metaphor?
you tell me.
it sounds like you're just trying to make some fancy point. That's all.
he's smarter than you thought.
he never says the word water. He always talks about the inlet.
well, he's a local kid. He knows the specifics about the island.
he's getting sloppy.
you think it's all an act?
Barrett's never said her name.
he's fidgety, looks like he's a submissive, but he's not entirely weak.
he doesn't have the looks or confidence to pull this off, so he calls Syd to seal the deal.
we saw the pictures. Kate rejected Barrett.
what pictures?
how does Barrett pass a polygraph?
even if he didn't kill her...
he'd have to make sure she's never found. - He's got a boat.
the locals checked it. No sign Kate was ever on it.
wouldn't a boat have GPS?
that's Kate's phone.
there, in the backseat.
Kate's mom has that right now. - You sure?
Yeah. They recovered that from her room.
so she made it back.
Kate's cell phone was left in the car and then later turned up in her room.
how? - We figure most of the story's true.
that's why they never changed it.
they did drop Kate off at the hotel.
Pearson took Barrett home, just like they said.
but then because Barrett was rejected, he circled back to punish Kate.
well, why would she let him in?
because he had this.
no sign of a struggle in the room.
Barrett lured her outside, maybe drugged her, took her to his boat.
he was obsessed with the inlet. He knew the traffic patterns there, when the fishermen were coming in and tourist charters were going out.
the blood from the catch attracts hundreds of sharks.
it's a feeding frenzy out there that time of night.
we asked him if he killed her. He didn't.
asked where her body is. He doesn't know.
technically, those aren't lies.
how can you prove this?
we'll get them to admit it.
this was after you dropped Kate at the motel. Agreed?
Yes.
victory picture.
so Kate's gone, but her phone is right there.
And? - We found it in her room.
you got any idea how it got there?
why is the GPS on your boat missing?
it isn't. - He tossed it after he dumped Kate.
who are you?
this.
this was your ticket into her room.
who is she? - You said the inlet's quiet between 4: 00 and 5 A. M.
that's when you took Kate out, right?
you didn't want the search party to find her, so you kept going. And going.
you had 6 hours before work.
how far did you get? About 75 miles out?
a full tank on a single outboard motor will get you 150 miles.
at 25 miles per hour, your round trip took just over 6 hours.
which is why you were late for work.
Oh, you didn't kill her. You just left her to die.
that's why you asked for a polygraph. You knew you'd pass it.
why did you take Kate to the inlet? - To look at the boats.
come on, man, you know what happens
sharks happen, Syd.
and they clean up your mess, don't they?
that's why you dumped her body out there. - No.
did you dump her? - No! What? God...
no, I didn't do that, man.
I didn't -- I didn't -- I mean, I didn't do that.
I think your time's up.
Oh, yeah? - Well, you took away their daughter, their dignity.
you don't get to win. We're going to find her.
you still think she has a chance, huh?
right. Thank you.
coast Guard's 70 miles out. No sign of her.
Kate's an amazing swimmer.
if he didn't kill her when she hit the water, there's still a chance.
JJ, that's 3 days in the ocean.
I know. I know.
help! Help! Someone help me! Help!
please help me!
agent Hotchner.
they found her, hugging a buoy. She's alive.
Oh, she did it.
she held on.
they found her. She's alive.
you know the first thing she said?
she's sorry.
they choked her. They...
and she's sorry.
you saved my life.
I knew it wouldn't be fair to leave her alone, but...
I didn't want to live.
it's my little girl.
and it's my job to keep her safe, and...
I wasn't there.
you made her who she is.
she hung on in the middle of the ocean for days.
that's strength I've never seen before.
I want Kate to meet you.
I'd like that.
thank you.
I'd like to think that...
that your son was watching out for her.
when do I leave?
the end of the week.
what?
they wanted you to start tomorrow.
no, I-- I can't. I need to train someone.
I'm not replacing you.
no, Hotch, you can't take this on yourself. Your hands are full.
we'll figure it out.
I'm hoping I can get you back.
Strauss wanted you to fill this out.
exit interview. Are you kidding me?
she's big on procedure.
just be honest.
I was hoping I could do something about this.
and I'm sorry I couldn't.
I know.
how am I supposed to tell them I'm leaving when I don't want to go?
the brass is really, really good at taking power away.
it makes them feel like they're in charge.
that sounds like a profile.
you're going to be much better off than any of us, you know that?
I'll miss you.
no.
wait a minute. I thought Hotch was supposed to
it's above his pay grade. Strauss', too.
they can just take you away?
so, we do nothing?
it's done.
it can't be that simple. - It is.
this job is hard enough. What are they trying to do, bury us?
you're too good. That's the problem.
it's true. You're on everybody's wish list.
our loss is somebody else's gain.
they can't just take you away.
you still here?
I figured you'd get to me eventually.
you're leaving?
you could have told me.
I would have done something.
I would have made it impossible for them to let you go.
I would have put something in your file.
it's not up to me. Or Hotch.
don't they understand that we're a family?
that that's why this works, is because we're a family.
do they even care?
I don't know.
I can't believe...
OK, no, that's
I'm supposed to say that this is a great opportunity, which it is.
I don't know the way this place works without you.
you're like the glue around here who's gonna make us feel safe.
there's plenty of big, strong men around.
see that, right there?
your total ignorance of how awesome you are is one of the 5, 000 things I love about you.
I'm still gonna be in the city, ok?
more than normal, probably.
sure. And we'll make a plan.
breakfast every Tuesday.
and life gets in the way.
and what if I only see you on birthdays and holidays?
I won't let that happen.
OK. You better not, because I know where to find you.
Yeah.
OK.
we'll walk out together.
there's-- there's one more thing I need to do before I go.
Oh. Ok.
I'm thankful for my years spent with this family.
for everything we shared, every chance we had to grow.
I'll take the best of them with me and lead by their example wherever I go.
a friend told me to be honest with you.
so, here it goes.
this isn't what I want, but I'll take the high road.
maybe it's because I look at everything as a lesson.
or because I don't want to walk around angry.
or maybe it's because I finally understand.
there are things we don't want to happen but have to accept.
things we don't want to know but have to learn.
and people we can't live without but have to let go.
19-year-old Kate Joyce, an honor student, was vacationing at the beach with friends when she disappeared nearly 3 days ago.
atlantic beach Detective Bob mathias...
they've had suspects in custody the whole time, but nothing.
can't even charge them with anything unless they find her body.
what are the chances of that?
...but are cooperating with the investigation.
Mathias says without a body... - They're still in Hotch's office, huh?
it can't be good.
...are suspected in her disappearance.
authorities only have 12 hours left to hold the men in custody without an official charge.
JJ's still in there?
and Strauss.
Oh, again with the dairy?
I can't help it. I love dairy.
it's been, like, what, 20 minutes?
well, 10 more minutes, we're in the air.
I don't think it's about the case.
do you know something?
do I know something?
she just repeated the question. You always say that's a sign.
do you know why JJ's in there?
I have no idea.
what is going on? - Maybe she asked for a raise.
have his blinds ever been closed?
I have given it thought. I'm not interested.
clearly.
you turned down the job twice without consulting your unit chief.
agent Jareau is under no obligation to discuss it with me.
if the Pentagon calls one of your team members, you should know about it.
why didn't you tell Agent Hotchner that you turned down the position?
I never wanted it to get this far because -- because you know it's a better job.
because I don't want to leave this one.
you've been here for 6 years.
nearly 7, ma'am. - Change is good.
and from what I understand, there's less travel with this position.
you could stay home with Henry.
excuse me?
I understand the sacrifices.
I do what I love.
it's made me a better person, a better mother.
any "sacrifices" I have made have been for my family.
I don't have a single regret.
we're all in agreement that Agent Jareau's a valuable part of this team, and it's understandable why the executive branch is requesting a transfer.
however, if Agent Jareau respectfully declines their request, there's no way you can make her go.
no, I can't.
have you looked at the video of the missing girl?
everyone's watching it now.
you're expected in Maryland within the hour.
we'll be there.
thank you.
JJ. Pentagon?
sorry I didn't tell you.
it's ok. It's just-- it's a big deal.
a liaison for the department of defense -- it's a major promotion.
are you sure you don't want this?
Hotch, I belong here.
you'd think profilers would cover better than that, wouldn't you?
you read up on the suspects?
presents like the typical dominant/submissive, but I doubt it's that textbook.
well, we only got one shot at this.
how long have they been in custody?
60 hours.
we have 12 hours to get a confession or find the body.
Syd Pearson has a lot of money and connections. If we let him go, we may never see him again.
and Barrett?
he doesn't have the same resources.
do you think these guys did it? - The locals do.
they tried to get them to turn against one another, but that didn't work.
it seems they have a Bond that dates back to childhood.
we only have a 30-minute flight. That's not enough time to delve into their histories.
bullet points on the missing woman. Second and third pages are all about the suspects.
Garcia, we're gonna need phone records, credit card receipts, anything you can find.
Yes, you'll have them when you get back.
thank you.
is everything ok?
what, you mean Strauss?
don't. I know that look.
everything's going to be fine.
Jean Racine said, "a tragedy need not have blood and death."
it's enough that it all be filled "with that majestic sadness that is the pleasure of tragedy."
Hey, you ok? - Uh, yeah. You?
I just feel kind of sick. Excuse me.
I got this offer from the Pentagon. I turned it down twice. I never told Hotch or Strauss.
and now Strauss wants you to take it.
well, of course she does. It'll make her look good if you get promoted.
I don't trust her for a second.
you shouldn't. What does Hotch think?
he knows I don't want to go.
well, then you won't.
Penelope's pretty freaked out, huh?
you have to ask?
OK, let's review.
OK. Kate Joyce, 19 years old, was last seen leaving a bar with these two men,
sydney Pearson and James Barrett, both 20 years old.
she was reported missing the next morning when she didn't meet her friends.
that was almost 3 days ago.
their story is they dropped Kate at the motel, but there were no cameras to confirm that.
and search and rescue's been all over the island.
dragged the inlet and they found absolutely nothing.
both said they had sex with Kate. They're claiming it was consensual.
there's no way to confirm. There's no body.
I doubt it was consensual.
we've got to prove they're guilty of more than just being seen with her.
well, the police weren't able to find any holes in their stories.
we're gonna have to break them down psychologically.
Morgan, I want you and Prentiss to lead the interrogation.
Dave, you and Reid start at the bar.
JJ, Kate Joyce's family is still at the station.
still? For 3 days?
they never went to the hotel.
I want you to stay with them.
Yeah.
they haven't left.
the mayor personally set them up with a penthouse suite at the Harrison grand, but they won't go.
they can't. You're their only source of information.
to be even a minute away would add to their torture.
I've kept them away from the suspects. Now, I don't get why you want them together.
trust me.
you're from the FBI? - Yes, ma'am. Jennifer Jareau.
Kate was almost Jennifer.
Jennifer Joyce. We would have called her JJ.
would you two like to head to the hotel?
I'll come with you. We'll have constant contact with my team.
will those boys still be here?
Yes, sir.
then so will I.
OK, well, let's find a place where we can talk. Come on.
hit the national news yesterday.
a lot of pressure.
the mayor would rather have a great white attacking than a homicide.
sure. A shark attack makes the mayor a victim.
a killer makes him responsible.
once she got into that car, we have no idea what happened.
well, the suspects' stories hold up.
they've told them dozens of times without variation. There's got to be some truth in them.
Syd Pearson is a handful.
Jimmy Barrett is dumber than a box full of rocks.
but they've been friends all their lives.
Yeah, go figure.
there's gotta be a reason.
well, they've only been out of their holding cells to be interrogated or to use the John.
you've got video?
Yeah, we got cameras in both rooms.
good. We'll have to rely on nonverbal cues.
that'll expose their weaknesses.
Hey, you.
What'd you do with Kate? - Calm down, man.
I will kill you, you understand?
you understand me?!
keep them him from me.
Barrett avoided conflict. Pearson was provocative.
the blond one's getting off on this.
well, if he knows where Kate is, that's his power.
Hey, can I get you anything?
what?
water? Soda? Are you hungry?
starving.
anything.
Tuggie's roast beef with fries.
the Curly ones. - You got it.
and a beer.
nice try.
what the hell was that?
just trying to establish some trust.
you gonna ask the other one, too? - No.
in other words, you're not going in there.
not yet.
Really?
you know, we don't have a whole lot of time here.
they've been slammed with the same questions for the last 2 days.
we go in there with that strategy, we'll get nowhere.
I don't get it. - If we go in there now, they have all the power.
so, what, we just wait?
for a while.
Kate Joyce comes from a stable family.
she went to good schools, got good grades, has good friends.
everything points to her being a total sweetheart.
you don't think she is? - I'm sure she is.
But?
she's 19.
everyone agrees -- kate wouldn't leave with those boys.
but she did.
Yeah. But why?
why would this girl, this sweetheart, take such a risk?
we don't have many images to go by.
we saw enough to know what happened.
Kate Joyce and her friends moved around a lot.
the suspects didn't.
they waited for her.
a Sea of opportunity.
why was she drawn to those guys?
- Her friends as if she knew. I never said that.
she was only here a week.
I think she trusted them.
Why?
she may have been testing her boundaries, but she's far too cautious to just go off with total strangers.
so she met them before Friday night.
look at her.
has she always been a fish?
we started her out in swim lessons our second summer down here.
when was that, Jeff,'95?
who's this? Your son?
drew.
so they were on the same swim team, but he looks like he's a few years younger?
was. He had leukemia.
I'm so sorry.
Katie was always very protective of him.
it hit her the hardest.
we should have been here. If we had driven down...
then she wouldn't have come. - Stop saying that.
it's the truth. The whole point was for her to get away.
get away? From what, Patty? From us?
I don't know, Jeff. She needed a break.
you shouldn't have let her come.
she's 19 years old. How was I gonna stop her?
and we said it was ok. - We were wrong.
God, don't you think I know that?!
I know you're trying to make sense of this.
trust me, there is no logic to any of it.
no. You have no idea, no idea what it's like.
our children were taken from us!
and there is nothing you can say that will change that.
you're right.
it's natural to want to blame someone.
but right now you really have to hold on to each other.
Garcia, what have you got?
oodles of records.
cell phones, credit cards, some juicy juvie. Sending details now.
it is safe to say these two have always been in trouble.
when did it start?
the summer of 2000.
they were only 10. What did they do?
see for yourself.
naughty boys.
shoplifting, vandalism, burned a house down.
abandoned building. Fireworks.
assault charges were dropped last summer.
well, it looks like they bring out the worst in each other.
ready?
what's up? - What's up?
my name's Derek Morgan.
I'm with the FBI's behavioral analysis unit.
what did you do?
Oh, I had this before Friday night.
that's not what I asked you.
but I know what you're thinking.
I highly doubt that.
division one lacrosse player.
obviously left-handed.
broke it in 3 places.
that sucks.
I bet you're a force.
too bad you didn't dominate the way they hoped, though.
why not?
I mean, what happened? Were you still hung up on the chapel hill rejection?
I mean, especially after you told everybody that you were gonna go.
I mean, damn, that's gotta sting a little bit.
what's the deal?
isn't it all in your little file?
well, let's see. My little file says...
you cheated on your SATS and you had your girlfriend take them for you.
that's another hard lesson, isn't it?
you can't trust anybody to keep their mouth shut.
why haven't you lawyered up?
I haven't done anything wrong.
that is so annoying.
do you know anything about video cameras?
the battery's probably dead.
Hey, guys. Can I get a new, uh, battery for the video camera?
OK.
what is that, roast beef?
did anyone ask you?
I'm not hungry. - Neither was I until I smelled that.
sorry.
OK.
um... So Syd has a Lexus. That's nice.
did he ever let you drive it? - No.
Yeah, he's kind of a control freak, huh?
I met him. He seems like a jerk.
and it says a lot that he can eat at a time like this.
and he didn't just get a car.
he got a Lexus.
at 16.
but, well, I guess that's what lrbs get.
little rich boys.
his dad's got a dealership.
do you always defend Syd?
defend him?
never mind.
so I see you have a boat.
single outboard motor, two-stroke engine.
is it fast?
Yeah. 25... 30.
so, when did your family move here?
I don't remember.
grade school? Middle school?
fifth grade.
so you were 10.
that's the year you met Syd.
how does any of this have to do with that girl?
he never mentions her by name. - Why not?
he's distancing himself.
depersonalizing the victim.
you want to talk about Kate?
I didn't know her.
you brought her up.
see the way he shifted his weight and cracked his neck?
his behavior was consistent until Kate was mentioned.
your statement says that you and Jimmy first met Kate on Friday night.
these are Kate's credit card receipts.
her and her friends rented a jet ski from Jimmy Friday morning.
he gets 100 customers a day.
Yeah, but come on, man.
I doubt they all look like Kate, now, do they? Hmm?
isn't that really why Jimmy texted you Friday morning?
woke you up and said, hey, man, you gotta get down here and see this girl.
and you liked what you saw, didn't you?
you invite her to the club, and maybe that would have been all right, but the problem is, when you and Jimmy get together, it's nothing but trouble.
and when you add a girl to that mix, she didn't stand a chance, did she?
just like kelley graybeal.
who? - Last summer.
she filed a complaint, but lucky for you she dropped all the charges.
look, man, we could do this for another, I don't know, whatever you got left...
or, I could make it... Real simple for you.
give me a polygraph.
after 65 hours of sitting in here, you want a polygraph?
well, that depends. - On what?
are you gonna ask me the questions?
cause I was really hoping you'd send that pretty one back in here.
you guys hear that? Barrett just asked for a polygraph.
you're kidding me. Him, too?
I don't understand why those boys agreed to a polygraph.
they didn't. They suggested it.
it's a countermeasure.
they're trying to manage perceptions trying to prove they don't have anything to hide.
they know where Kate is right now.
well, we don't know that for sure.
all right, um...
why don't we head to the hotel, ok?
we could go and look at the ocean.
I can't believe you're thinking about a view right now.
I'm not.- You just said
because it calms you. - Ok, you guys haven't been outside for days.
you haven't eaten. You haven't slept. You cannot keep going like this.
you go ahead.
we think Kate was comfortable with these guys.
how? Their only other encounter was at the jet ski rental.
the only documented encounter.
Garcia's running her friends' credit cards, too.
they could have met someplace else.
I don't know. She's a smart girl.
well, they're handsome, charming, 19.
you remember 19?
she would know better than to be outnumbered.
what if Pearson promised to dump Jim Barrett?
and, what, Jim retaliated?
I could work that theory.
when do we get the results?
any minute.
so, what if they didn't do it?
then we're back to nothing? - One of them knows where Kate is.
how can you be sure?
because an innocent person doesn't sit quietly for 3 days.
they get angry and defensive.
these guys are going out of their way to appear calm and in control.
they've got something to hide.
then why take the polygraph?
cause they're stalling. Serial killers are kings of manipulation.
serial killers?
uh, there's only one potential victim.
serial killing is a qualitative characteristic. It not just about numbers.
they've assaulted at least one girl before. It was only a matter of time before they did it again.
Barrett's a perfect match for Pearson.
his family uprooted from the city, forcing him to adapt to his new surroundings.
he's eager to fit in and quick to follow.
and Pearson's definitely got the dominant traits.
he's loud, he's physical, he's smart, he's charismatic, and he's privileged.
sounds like a peach. - You should talk to him.
love to. - I'll take you to him.
JJ, how are the Joyces doing?
they lost their son 3 years ago.
if we can't find Kate...
if Kate knew these boys better than we thought, you might want to dig a little.
dig? - If the family thinks it could help, they may reveal something.
I know. It's just... They shouldn't have to.
Hotch, we can't lose her.
Strauss thinks we're all replaceable.
I went over her head to try to explain that we're not.
are you the bad cop?
I'm not a cop.
a name like that didn't come with manners?
a gentleman walks a Lady to the door.
she wasn't much of a Lady. - Watch your mouth.
the girl was horny, man.
I mean, she practically begged me for it.
that's a bunch of bull -- The son of a bitch passed.
how? How'd you do it?
bastard believes his lies are the truth.
takes a few deep breaths and passes.
old-timer's kind of dramatic, isn't he?
you know, it's actually much simpler than that.
you see, uh, I didn't actually do anything to her.
you didn't do anything?
you gave me some pretty graphic details.
Oh, don't get me wrong.
my DNA is... All over that girl, but, uh, that doesn't mean I killed her.
I got pictures.
what? - On my cell.
you want to see?
you're giving us consent?
give me this guy's property! Now!
what the hell was that? - That was the camera.
no, the yelling. - That was Agent Morgan.
Barrett, it says here you were half an hour late to work on Saturday morning.
I was hung-over.
Hung-over? That's nothing new, but being late is.
it looks like you always clock in 10 minutes early, gas up the jet skis, get the life vests out.
what happened that morning?
I just told you. I was hung-over.
got you. Hung-over, slept in.
what about Friday night, Friday after the bar?
we drove to the inlet.
drove to the inlet. Approximately what time would you say you drove to the inlet?
2: 00, 2:30.
why would you go to the water at 2: 00 or 2: 30 in the morning?
the boats start coming in.
in the middle of the night the boats start coming in?
Yeah. They fish all night, then they bring in the catch.
then they sell it on the docks to the restaurants and all that.
Syd wanted to show her, then he drove her back, dropped her off at the hotel, and the next thing I know, it's morning.
and you slept in?
my alarm clock's broken.
broken. Your alarm clock's broken?
broken.
did it make you upset?
can you fix the damn camera, please?!
sit down.
how'd you pass it?
now, a gentleman never shares, but...
see?
no tears.
now, you see how happy she was?
did Kate drink often?
I told you, she's an athlete.
were you surprised she had a fake I. D?
it's no secret. She liked going out with her friends.
why are you doing this?
I'm not judging Kate. I want to find her.
what time is it?
it's almost dark out.
we can't do this anymore. Please just find her.
where is she? - I don't know.
where is Kate Joyce?
you got a hair or something?
you know what I don't get it, Rossi, what I just can't wrap my brain around?
no, what's that?
how this could have been consensual.
don't sit down. Don't sit down.
consensual, huh?
what does that look like?
how do you get a nice girl like Kate to do both of you in the same night?
she liked it.
what did she like?
what, did she do both of you at once?
come on, you know that.
did you take turns? What?
I mean, you said she liked it. But what? What did she like?
you know, man. - No, I don't.
is this what you did to her? Hmm?
you pin her down?
I told you, she liked it.
you held her just like this.
you choked her.
well, how long before she tapped out?
this is exactly what you did to her.
you know what I think, Syd?
I think Kate didn't want to fool around with your friend.
so she begged you to take her home.
but you couldn't diss your boy like that, could you?
so you helped him.
pinned her down in the backseat.
maybe you threw her out in the dirt.
maybe you hit her too hard, she stopped breathing, you were stuck, weren't you?
it's not true.
is that what you mean by consensual?
they sure know how to run out the clock.
Yeah. What have we got?
less than 3 hours.
what do you think?
well, he's not smart enough to have done this by himself.
he's always been a follower.
Pearson's charming enough to pick up a good girl, but Barrett was just along for the ride.
take a look at the photos.
Oh, she wasn't interested in Barrett at all.
but he's the one she met in the morning.
all right. Well, I'll keep pushing. How's it going in there?
I wouldn't be surprised if Morgan turned off the camera in a minute.
I told you, Agent Jareau's transfer is an executive decision.
ma'am, I'm asking you not to take it out on Agent Jareau because I went over your head.
I know this is emotional for you
it's not emotional. It's a bad decision.
she's a vital member of our team.
I'm afraid it's a done deal.
that's unacceptable.
well, what do you want me to do, Aaron, lose my job so she can keep hers?
and I have no say in this?
you don't get it. They're not asking you.
they want her back in D. C. now.
what do you think?
I don't know. This kid's got no shame. No guilt.
he did horrible things to Kate, but...
I don't think he killed her.
so what are we saying?
the only thing he's guilty of is being a scumbag?
any official charge for that?
the storm came through and separated the land.
that's what made the inlet.
one thing you can trust is the ground beneath you, until one day it all just shifts.
is that some kind of a metaphor?
you tell me.
it sounds like you're just trying to make some fancy point. That's all.
he's smarter than you thought.
he never says the word water. He always talks about the inlet.
well, he's a local kid. He knows the specifics about the island.
he's getting sloppy.
you think it's all an act?
Barrett's never said her name.
he's fidgety, looks like he's a submissive, but he's not entirely weak.
he doesn't have the looks or confidence to pull this off, so he calls Syd to seal the deal.
we saw the pictures. Kate rejected Barrett.
what pictures?
how does Barrett pass a polygraph?
even if he didn't kill her...
he'd have to make sure she's never found. - He's got a boat.
the locals checked it. No sign Kate was ever on it.
wouldn't a boat have GPS?
that's Kate's phone.
there, in the backseat.
Kate's mom has that right now. - You sure?
Yeah. They recovered that from her room.
so she made it back.
Kate's cell phone was left in the car and then later turned up in her room.
how? - We figure most of the story's true.
that's why they never changed it.
they did drop Kate off at the hotel.
Pearson took Barrett home, just like they said.
but then because Barrett was rejected, he circled back to punish Kate.
well, why would she let him in?
because he had this.
no sign of a struggle in the room.
Barrett lured her outside, maybe drugged her, took her to his boat.
he was obsessed with the inlet. He knew the traffic patterns there, when the fishermen were coming in and tourist charters were going out.
the blood from the catch attracts hundreds of sharks.
it's a feeding frenzy out there that time of night.
we asked him if he killed her. He didn't.
asked where her body is. He doesn't know.
technically, those aren't lies.
how can you prove this?
we'll get them to admit it.
this was after you dropped Kate at the motel. Agreed?
Yes.
victory picture.
so Kate's gone, but her phone is right there.
And? - We found it in her room.
you got any idea how it got there?
why is the GPS on your boat missing?
it isn't. - He tossed it after he dumped Kate.
who are you?
this.
this was your ticket into her room.
who is she? - You said the inlet's quiet between 4: 00 and 5 A. M.
that's when you took Kate out, right?
you didn't want the search party to find her, so you kept going. And going.
you had 6 hours before work.
how far did you get? About 75 miles out?
a full tank on a single outboard motor will get you 150 miles.
at 25 miles per hour, your round trip took just over 6 hours.
which is why you were late for work.
Oh, you didn't kill her. You just left her to die.
that's why you asked for a polygraph. You knew you'd pass it.
why did you take Kate to the inlet? - To look at the boats.
come on, man, you know what happens
sharks happen, Syd.
and they clean up your mess, don't they?
that's why you dumped her body out there. - No.
did you dump her? - No! What? God...
no, I didn't do that, man.
I didn't -- I didn't -- I mean, I didn't do that.
I think your time's up.
Oh, yeah? - Well, you took away their daughter, their dignity.
you don't get to win. We're going to find her.
you still think she has a chance, huh?
right. Thank you.
coast Guard's 70 miles out. No sign of her.
Kate's an amazing swimmer.
if he didn't kill her when she hit the water, there's still a chance.
JJ, that's 3 days in the ocean.
I know. I know.
help! Help! Someone help me! Help!
please help me!
agent Hotchner.
they found her, hugging a buoy. She's alive.
Oh, she did it.
she held on.
they found her. She's alive.
you know the first thing she said?
she's sorry.
they choked her. They...
and she's sorry.
you saved my life.
I knew it wouldn't be fair to leave her alone, but...
I didn't want to live.
it's my little girl.
and it's my job to keep her safe, and...
I wasn't there.
you made her who she is.
she hung on in the middle of the ocean for days.
that's strength I've never seen before.
I want Kate to meet you.
I'd like that.
thank you.
I'd like to think that...
that your son was watching out for her.
when do I leave?
the end of the week.
what?
they wanted you to start tomorrow.
no, I-- I can't. I need to train someone.
I'm not replacing you.
no, Hotch, you can't take this on yourself. Your hands are full.
we'll figure it out.
I'm hoping I can get you back.
Strauss wanted you to fill this out.
exit interview. Are you kidding me?
she's big on procedure.
just be honest.
I was hoping I could do something about this.
and I'm sorry I couldn't.
I know.
how am I supposed to tell them I'm leaving when I don't want to go?
the brass is really, really good at taking power away.
it makes them feel like they're in charge.
that sounds like a profile.
you're going to be much better off than any of us, you know that?
I'll miss you.
no.
wait a minute. I thought Hotch was supposed to
it's above his pay grade. Strauss', too.
they can just take you away?
so, we do nothing?
it's done.
it can't be that simple. - It is.
this job is hard enough. What are they trying to do, bury us?
you're too good. That's the problem.
it's true. You're on everybody's wish list.
our loss is somebody else's gain.
they can't just take you away.
you still here?
I figured you'd get to me eventually.
you're leaving?
you could have told me.
I would have done something.
I would have made it impossible for them to let you go.
I would have put something in your file.
it's not up to me. Or Hotch.
don't they understand that we're a family?
that that's why this works, is because we're a family.
do they even care?
I don't know.
I can't believe...
OK, no, that's
I'm supposed to say that this is a great opportunity, which it is.
I don't know the way this place works without you.
you're like the glue around here who's gonna make us feel safe.
there's plenty of big, strong men around.
see that, right there?
your total ignorance of how awesome you are is one of the 5, 000 things I love about you.
I'm still gonna be in the city, ok?
more than normal, probably.
sure. And we'll make a plan.
breakfast every Tuesday.
and life gets in the way.
and what if I only see you on birthdays and holidays?
I won't let that happen.
OK. You better not, because I know where to find you.
Yeah.
OK.
we'll walk out together.
there's-- there's one more thing I need to do before I go.
Oh. Ok.
I'm thankful for my years spent with this family.
for everything we shared, every chance we had to grow.
I'll take the best of them with me and lead by their example wherever I go.
a friend told me to be honest with you.
so, here it goes.
this isn't what I want, but I'll take the high road.
maybe it's because I look at everything as a lesson.
or because I don't want to walk around angry.
or maybe it's because I finally understand.
there are things we don't want to happen but have to accept.
things we don't want to know but have to learn.
and people we can't live without but have to let go.
bristol, VIRGINIA
you got your seat cushion?
Yeah, they're in the back. Lyle, you got your jacket?
mom, I know how to dress for a football game.
you know, whenever we get there, you're always cold.
he's ok. Where are the tickets?
I thought you got them.
you said you grabbed them.
if it wasn't for me, you guys would be lost.
Lyle, you left this door open!
let's go. We're gonna miss kickoff.
what if it's Jenny? - Call her from the car.
you know your daughter. She probably just wants to talk about a new dress she bought.
come on. Come on.
mom, dad, this is Jenny.
I'm in trouble.
I'm in so much trouble.
I know you taught me to not be afraid, but I'm so afraid.
when you get this message... I'll probably be dead.
so I just wanted to tell you that...
Oh, God, please, pick up the phone! Please!
I hope you want me to come in.
I mean, between writer's block and my neighbor's construction, I'm going crazy here.
what's going on there?
I just got a call.
the bodies of two young women were found in the Elden Street area in Bristol, Virginia.
they were both tortured and electrocuted.
did they make any phone calls?
Yes. But without the signature.
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
is that Ellie again?
she texts me every morning on her way to school.
how's she doing?
well, she's already got herself a bff named Jill, and she thinks she wants to play soccer.
she's adjusting. That's good.
bristol, Virginia.
the body of 25-year-old Jenny Delilly was found yesterday.
she had been tortured, sodomized, and electrocuted before being forced to make a goodbye call to her parents.
her body was then dumped off Elden Street.
a week ago, the body of Kara Kirkland was found in the same area having suffered identical injuries.
this reminds me of "the butcher" case.
why does that name sound familiar to me?
"the butcher" was a sexual sadist that killed 20 women in the same area of Virginia from 1984 to 1993 and then vanished.
he tortured blond women in their 20s that lived in or near Bristol.
that was one of Rossi's old cases, isn't it? - Yes.
does he know?
some vacation.
did you get any sun?
I never got any anything.
do you think "the butcher" is back?
I doubt it. We profiled him as a white male in his late 40s back then.
he'd be in his 70s by now.
didn't you almost catch him?
in the spring of '93, we narrowed the geographical profile.
we alerted every blonde in their mid-20s in Bristol and the surrounding counties.
the pressure got so intense, the killings just stopped.
well, the Copelands killed into their 70s.
this could be him coming back.
it's probably a copycat.
if he's emulating "the butcher," he could just be getting started.
Marcel Proust wrote,"remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were."
all right, let's go over victimology.
both Jenny Delilly and Kara Kirkman were single professional women.
Jenny had just gotten a job as a Web designer, and Kara worked for a nonprofit.
each woman was taken from a populated area with no witnesses.
Jenny from a crowded drugstore parking lot,
Kara from the back patio of a ground-floor apartment when her roommate went inside to answer the phone.
why not take the roommate?
she's brunette. He prefers blondes.
these vics were forced to make phone calls.
Garcia, were you able to trace the calls?
my pretties, they're using disposable cells, so I'm coming up empty.
we do have a timeline, though.
according to the M.E.'s report, both victims were dead for about 3 hours before they were found, which means based upon the times of their messages, they endured 5 additional hours of torture after making their goodbye calls.
it wasn't enough that he caused his victims pain and suffering, it extended to their parents as well?
Rossi, were the phone calls "the butcher" made his victims leave similar?
Yeah, but the content varied.
13 vics left answering machine messages for loved ones, 5 actually talked to someone before they died, and two reached no one.
but didn't "the butcher" make his victims end their messages by saying they were enjoying it?
that was the signature.
wouldn't that make a sadist flaccid?
it wasn't about him. It was about the parents.
he wanted to make sure that they knew he had complete control and dominance over their daughters.
all right, Morgan and Prentiss, go to the M.E.
we need to compare ritual and M.O.
Rossi, Reid, and I will interview the families and go over the messages.
Rossi, what's in the box?
evil.
this isn't "the butcher," believe me.
we need a room with a whiteboard, a window, and 5 chairs.
unless the butcher's Jack Lalanne, this is a younger copycat.
the bodies were left in the exact same location.
everybody knew the details of this case.
the paper even printed part of the answering machine messages.
have you been able to step up police presence on Elden Street?
well, it's a 7-mile stretch that runs through the city.
I've done what I could considering our budget.
are detectives Clemmons, Benton, and Gallagher still here?
they worked the first case.
Clemmons and Benton both died 2 years ago.
gallagher retired from the force when his wife was killed at the Pentagon on 9/11.
so you're the lead Detective on this?
unfortunately.
look, the families of the victims should be here any minute.
if there's anything I can do to help you guys, let me know.
thank you.
you can tell from the burn wounds that they were assaulted with an electrified object.
curling iron? Poker? - Inconclusive.
they also have numerous lacerations on their bodies.
slight ones near the throat, deep ones on the chest.
multiple knives. - The guy was creative.
creatively sick.
what about the contusions on the backs of their heads?
they were most likely sustained during the abduction.
this is a different approach than the butcher's abductions.
based on Rossi's profile, the butcher was a smooth-talker who lured his victims without initial physical force.
yet clearly this unsub doesn't have the same confidence or finesse.
he's sloppy.
thank you. - You're welcome.
how have you been?
I, uh, I got a job at Joe's coffee.
you should come by sometime.
sounds good.
I'm hungry.
how's he doing?
what, am I talking to myself?
I should go.
if I had a good caretaker, he'd be here on time.
I don't pay you to be late.
I'm coming. - That's what you said an hour ago.
I should've gotten rid of you when I had a chance.
the old girl would have fed me by now.
she was so scared.
I'm sorry I have to ask you to do this.
mom, dad, this is Jenny.
I'm in trouble.
I kept asking her what was wrong, but...
she just made me listen.
I'm in so much trouble.
I know you taught me to not be afraid, but I'm so afraid.
when you get this message, I'll probably be dead.
so I just wanted to tell you that...
did your fiancee say anything that sounded out of the ordinary?
no.
she sounded like herself, considering the circumstances.
you say that her lexical features are consistent with her vernacular?
are the words hers?
Yeah, that's what she said.
I need to ask you about the words that Jenny used.
does it sound like something that she would say? Does she sound like herself?
we never - we never told her to not be afraid.
why would she say that?
she wouldn't.
at the end of the conversation, did Kara...
say that she enjoyed it? - No, she didn't say she enjoyed it.
what are you guys not telling me?
I need some air.
what happened in there? - We talked about the signature.
even though Jenny Delilly's message didn't have the whole signature, I want you to see if it matches any of the old butcher phone transcripts.
you think something in Jenny's call was scripted?
possibly.
Baldwin softball field.
good. Very good.
heritage Mall.
very good.
gas station off West State.
no. No, try again.
it's the one off West State.
it's ok if you don't remember.
don't tell me I don't remember.
let's just try another one.
you're trying to make me look stupid. I'm not stupid.
no one said you were stupid.
you just...You gotta keep practicing.
I know a better way to practice.
it's not time.
it's time when I say it's time.
I want to go out.
take me out.
all right.
this is right where she parked her car.
and then she rushed in there to get a prescription.
then she comes back to her car and somebody gets her attention.
they call out to her.
she throws her stuff in the trunk, runs off that way, and that's when we lose her.
so how do you snatch someone from here?
push her into a car?
it's way too crowded.
but there is a blind spot right there.
there's enough of an obstruction here to park your car, blitz her from behind, and then push her into the vehicle.
but could you do that alone? - I doubt it.
and two people would explain how the first victim was abducted so quickly from the patio when her roommate went in to get the phone.
it would also shed light on the M.E.'s findings.
there wasn't one unsub with two knives, it was two unsubs with their own weapon.
please tell mom I love her.
tell Joey the same.
he wants me to say I enjoyed it, but I didn't.
Yes, she did. She's dead.
he doesn't even sound human.
did you transfer all the tapes yourself?
17 years ago he sounded like background noise, but when I digitized them, you could hear every word.
Yes, she did. She's dead.
it's stunningly creepy.
I never caught "the butcher," but I caught his voice.
I'd go to bed hearing him, wake up hearing him.
it would be like hearing a message from Jack the Ripper.
why haven't you ever written about him?
he had too much power.
I need to find him first.
mom, dad, this is Susan.
I'm in trouble. I'm in so much trouble.
I know you taught me never to be afraid, but I am so afraid.
what number was she?
number 20. Susan Cole.
his last victim.
Jenny Delilly's message didn't match any old victims' messages until we get to Susan Cole, "the butcher" 's last kill.
their messages were identical, minus the line about enjoying it, the butcher's signature.
the victimologies are similar, too.
what did the M.E.say?
multiple wounds from two separate knives on each victim.
there's no way Jenny Delilly was abducted by one person.
so two knives and two unsubs?
he couldn't take Jenny alone.
when you look at Kara's patio and the fact that the roommate went inside for two seconds, it's highly unlikely.
so what are you saying?
we're looking for a team.
miss.
miss, I need your help.
my caretaker had a heart attack. Please, you gotta help me.
Oh, my God. Where is he?
sir,
look at her lips.
she's pretty.
don't worry.
we're gonna tell you exactly what to say.
everything's gonna end all right.
she lives nearby.
third body in a week.
I got additional units patrolling the area, but it's too big.
the unsubs fit into the community. They go unnoticed.
this is the exact same place Susan Cole, "the butcher" 's last kill, was dumped.
Heather's body is laid out in the same way.
arms above her head, demeaning straddle.
exactly the same stab wounds.
the wounds are strategically placed so they miss the major arteries but inflict maximum pain.
these unsubs aren't just trying to copy "the butcher," they're trying to exactly reenact his last kill.
copycats usually start from the beginning.
why are they fixated on the last crime?
something about this particular case is significant to them?
morgan and Prentiss, contact the parents. See if they got a phone call.
you should make the notification first.
we will.
and we'll, uh, bring the parents down to the station.
we need to release the profile.
"the butcher" is somehow involved in this.
the nuances are just too similar.
the park, the hand position, the body.
I think we should wait on the profile.
but there are aspects of "the butcher" 's signature that are not present here, Dave.
and there are things that this unsub is doing "the butcher" never did.
you profiled him as a narcissist who worked alone.
he would never partner up.
I just have a gut feeling that it's him.
do you want to hold back the profile based on a feeling?
these unsubs, or unknown subjects, are considerably organized.
they most likely have some sort of secondary location they use to torture the victims.
their skill level is evidenced by the high-risk public nature of their abductions.
they're able to lure their intended victims with some kind of a ruse.
they then blitz them with overwhelming force...
mom, daddy... He wants me to say I enjoyed it, but I didn't.
Yes, she did. She's dead.
I'm in trouble. I'm in so much trouble.
I know you taught me to never be afraid, but I am so afraid.
agent Rossi, has "the butcher" come out of hiding?
we think that this is the work of two of his fans and that they're going to strike again.
you're in a good mood.
wednesday was always a good day for me.
yesterday was Tuesday.
she was good.
she responded right.
I upped the volts on the charger. I think that helped.
the call went better, too.
you got her to say exactly what I needed.
you've never been so helpful.
that's not true.
name one time you helped me without being told.
when I was 10. - Oh, please.
no, I - I helped with the woman in the hallway.
there was never a woman in the hallway. - Yes, there was.
she was running and...
I got her for you.
you remember that? I helped out.
well, how are you gonna help me today?
the pharmacy girl gets off at 2:00, the nurse's shift ends at 3:00, and the teacher gets out of school at 3:30.
what about that girl outside the other day?
Anna, our neighbor?
she's too close.
Where's her picture?
we never took one.
no, come on, choose one of these girls.
they'll all be good.
I know you're not convinced about the profile.
"the butcher" is a part of this.
Bundy stopped using his broken arm ruse.
Dahmer didn't eat all of his victims.
sometimes the psychopathology changes for these guys.
I know. I still think it's a copycat.
I'm not so sure.
then if you feel this strongly, you should continue to explore "the butcher" as a suspect, and the rest of the team will investigate the possibility of the relationship between the two copycats.
Thanks.
the Yoshim dual knife is the best on the market.
its serrated blade allows you to cut through anything.
and the handle is dishwasher safe.
if you buy one today, you will also get our Yoshim two-pronged carving fork...
I love her hands. - I'll be here next Friday, so you can pick one up then, too.
she's got pretty hands.
this is what it is.
a father-son partnership?
wait, an older Alpha with a younger submissive?
it's very rare for sexual sadism to be an inherited trait.
that's why we ruled it out.
what if he created his partner and groomed him?
he would be in complete control and have his trust.
it would explain how "the butcher" is able to abduct women.
he's older, appears harmless, but his son lies in wait.
"the butcher" has a child. I never profiled that.
I just got a call from Heather Langley's father.
turns out he did get a message.
he said he'd checked his phone.
no one thought to check Mr. Langley's job.
his secretary pulled the voicemail.
she can play it for us. - Let's hear it.
go ahead, please.
mom, dad, this is Heather.
when you get this message, I'll probably be dead.
tomorrow you're going to find me,
and when you do, please know that I... I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed it. That's his signature.
it's him.
I'm not saying this. - Say it.
you gotta stick to the script. - I won't!
she's ruining it!
if you'd just brought me Annie, none of this would've happened.
dad, please. - Please, my ass.
you can't get anything right. You can't get the house right, my food right, you can't get the kill right.
I'll show you how to kill. I'll show you how to kill!
I'll show you how to kill.
agent Rossi, uh, I need to give the press a statement.
not yet.
word's already leaked out that this is "the butcher" and his son.
well, fix your faucet and tell your men to be quiet.
look, people are scared.
this guy's spent a decade terrorizing this area,
you think I don't know that?
we need to figure out why he's back, like BTK or the grim sleeper.
let's go over victimology one more time.
he kills blondes who are living on their own.
he takes them from public places with some form of ruse.
he's reenacting his last kill. For what reason?
maybe there's something symbolic about the last kill.
let's hear her call again.
Hey, guys, maybe we should take a look at the victims that didn't call anybody.
there were 13 recording messages and 5 documented conversations with loved ones.
so what? - So there were 20 kills.
two victims didn't call anyone.
I just assumed those victims couldn't reach anyone.
let's pull the files of the victims that didn't leave a message.
Reid might be onto something.
what are you doing?
what's it look like?
I'm hungry. And my stories aren't on.
10 minutes and I'll be in.
I want to go hunt.
no, dad. We're not hunting today.
why not?
we need to lay low. I mean, there's cops all over the neighborhood.
we'll start up again next week, ok?
I don't want to wait. It's been 3 damn weeks since we've been hunting.
dad, we hunted yesterday.
no, we didn't.
Yeah, we did. Look in there.
I didn't do that. - Yeah, you did.
no, I didn't.
you've been hunting without me.
why would I hunt without you?
what's her name? - Shelly something.
we got her at the pharmacy. - I didn't do that.
she was selling knives. Why would I do that? I got knives.
she wouldn't say the words.
that's not my work. I don't do work like that.
dad, it's ok if you don't remember.
dad, this is normal.
this ain't normal.
if I'm doing work like that, then you need to kill me.
just kill me!
so Sylvia Marks was "the butcher" 's first kill.
Karen Bachner was his eighth.
so why weren't they forced to make phone calls?
Sylvia was his first kill. He was building up his confidence.
then he thinks to himself, how can I hurt the most people?
I'll have them make calls.
and then 6 women after that made phone calls. Why did he stop at Karen?
Garcia, what are Karen Bachner's parents' names?
george and Claire Bachner died in a car accident when Karen was 19.
but my notes say Karen had a husband named Lee Mullens.
but he didn't receive a call.
when I interviewed him at the station, he said he didn't have an answering machine.
do they have a child? - Uh, negative.
wait a minute. They had a son. I wrote it down. Colby.
Garcia, run Karen's maiden name. Bachner.
Oh - there it is, sir. You are totally right.
Karen had a son, Colby Bachner, born at Johnson Memorial in Bristol, Virginia.
was the father there to sign the birth certificate?
Yes. His name was... Lee Mullens.
Karen had Colby 2 years before her and Lee were married.
are the father or son still in the area?
Yeah. Lee Mullens and Colby Bachner live at 1844 Shadow Wood lane, which is 6 miles from where the victims were dumped.
reid: So maybe Karen Bachner never made a call because the most important person in her life was already in the room with her - her son.
Oh, hells, no. They're licensed electricians.
let's go.
dad? We should talk.
fine. We can go hunt today.
I'll go pick someone up and then I'll come and get you.
I'm gonna get you someone that'll make you really happy.
I'll come by and pick you up when I got her. Ok?
I wrote down where I'm going.
and you're all set. Thank you so much. Have a good day.
Hey. Ready for that coffee?
Yeah.
FBI. Don't move.
put your hands in the air.
what are you doing here?
sir, move slowly down the stairs.
why are you here? My son isn't here.
you're under arrest for the murders of Chloe Moore, Reilly Gold, and Sylvia Marks.
I don't know them.
please, I need to call someone.
you can call from the station.
Rossi, wait. - I'm done waiting.
we checked the house. There's no torture chamber, no son.
there's a fresh grave in the backyard, and the son Colby left a note saying he was going to find a prize.
Garcia, check Mullens' records and see if he owns any other property.
check under the son's name, employment records, anything you can find.
got it.
Hey, guys. I think I found something.
Morgan, let's get all the police cars out of the neighborhood in case the son comes back.
everything in the house is labeled - drawers, the refrigerator.
I found donepezil and flashcards in the medicine cabinet.
Donepezil? Alzheimer's?
it's a cholinesterase inhibitor. It improves acetylcholine, either by increasing levels in the brain or enhancing nerve cells' response to it.
so this guy gets to forgot while the family has to live with this forever.
alzheimer's affects short-term memory before it affects long-term.
that it explains the scripted phone calls and the dump sites.
it also explains why he started up again.
he's repeating his last kill because he can't remember it.
he killed over a 10-year period. He probably remembers the earliest victims.
what did you find?
he's got slides of all the prior abduction sites.
you want me to go in with you?
I've got this.
we met 20 years ago.
do you remember that, Mullens?
I'd like a soda with lemon, thank you.
you played the grieving husband.
I was a young FBI Agent.
do you remember these women?
I don't know them. - Of course you do.
you wouldn't have forgotten them yet.
so tell me, where is your son, Mullens?
where is he taking your next victim?
to a friend's place? To an abandoned house?
I rewired this house.
did he help you with that?
or did you do that on your own?
like you did... All of these.
those your trophies?
what do you know about trophies?
I like trophies.
it proves you won something.
well, you're not gonna win today.
I'm scared.
you don't have a right to be scared.
those women were scared.
now, where's your son?
please, Colby, stop. - Stop talking.
why are you doing this to me?
please, why are you doing this to me?
please stop talking!
please, just let me go. I won't tell them.
shut up. Shut up.
shut up!
it must be hard to lose your mind.
I wouldn't know.
you start forgetting how to feed yourself.
soon you're stinking up your pants, wearing diapers.
I ain't wearing no diaper.
you peed into your boxers 2 minutes ago.
you need them now.
so...
how did you get your son to do all this?
did you get him to help you to kill your wife?
Karen left us. - No, no, no, no.
that's what you convinced him.
but you killed her when she figured you out.
you took her to a chamber, the same place you took Heather Langley,
Kara Kirkland, Sylvia Marks.
Sylvia's a pretty name.
she graduated from Georgetown.
she wanted to be a chemist.
but you burned her so bad, her family couldn't recognize her.
how did you do that?
did you use a fire poker or a curling iron?
something you made? Something you bought?
when she saw the Lexwell, her eyes went so wide, she scared me half to death.
find out what that is.
Lexwell is a camera manufacturer based out of New York.
they've been around since the forties.
have they always produced photography equipment?
uh, back in the day, they made electroshock therapy equipment.
unknown object penetrating our victims.
Garcia, what mental hospitals in Virginia use ECT machines?
5 hospitals use Lexwell equipment.
of those 5, 3 have been torn down, 2 are still in operation.
OK, cross-check that list of hospitals against Mullens' electrical business client list.
Yeah, I'm already doing that.
Mullens wired some buildings at the Oakton Center back in the eighties.
you know that place? - It's a former mental institution.
Yeah, on 86 acres.
two of the buildings are still in operation.
the rest of the place is abandoned.
Thanks, baby girl.
Hotch, we know where the kid is.
where are you going?
put down the knife. - I'll kill her.
the killing is done.
please help me.
this is not your fault, Colby.
your father got you into this.
no, no. You don't know my dad.
we know you're losing him, Colby.
this isn't gonna help.
he's getting better.
no. He isn't.
and I know that scares you because you already lost your mother.
she left us!
your father killed her.
no. No, no. No, you're wrong.
you were 10.
he strapped her to this table.
my mom went to Boston to live with her sister.
your father brought her here.
you were probably in the car.
you blocked it out. Think back.
he most likely knocked her out at home and brought her here.
the - the only woman we brought here from the house, I helped him with.
and that was your mother, Colby.
no... She--she left us.
every one of your father's victims made a call, except for your mother.
because she laid on this table and said goodbye to you right here.
this wasn't your fault, Colby.
mommy loves you.
She--she... She's not dead.
She...she left us.
She--she... She left us!
you don't want to hurt her, son.
you know, parents are supposed to protect their children.
well, sometimes they don't get the memo.
Oh, please don't tell me that's Ellie again.
she just wants me to say good night.
trust me, Prentiss, I get it.
but I'm the first person she wants to speak to in the morning.
she won't go to bed unless she talks to me at night.
the girl's got PTSD. She's gotta vent to someone.
a professional.
or someone who's been there.
Hey, uh... None of us here ever thought we'd get "the butcher."
nice work.
you, too.
I do remember you.
in the end, you're the reason I stopped.
mark Twain wrote, when I was younger, I could remember anything, whether it had happened or not.
but my faculties are decaying now...
and soon I shall be so I cannot remember anything but the things that never happened.
I need a gurney. Prisoner down.
it is sad to go to pieces like this, but we all have to do it.
look at me. Look at me.
okay It's gonna be okay.
why is he doing this?
is that enough?
we did what you wanted. Let us go.
no. Now it's my turn.
No!
Hey, good news.
Ellie just got placed with a foster family, so, fingers crossed.
Oh, that's great. I'm happy for her.
we got a case in Akron, Ohio.
two couples killed in two weeks.
one a week? That's not much of a cooling-off period.
Scott and Kathy Hartway.
found in their car in an isolated spot.
the son of Sam had a short cooling-off period.
he also attacked couples in cars.
Yeah, but the first couple were killed in their house. Robert and Allison Keppler.
in both cases, the husbands were killed with a silenced 9-millimeter, the wife was stabbed multiple times.
he crosses racial lines.
and socio-economic ones. The Kepplers lived in an upscale neighborhood, the Hartways were blue collar.
that's a big change in crime scenes, car versus house.
two radically different M. O. S.
not to mention he subdues two people. That takes a lot of skill.
there's no indication of how he overwhelms them.
there's no antemortem bruising. He doesn't use a blitz attack.
well, he's got a 9-millimeter. He doesn't need to.
how about signs of forced entry to the car or the house?
no. But Akron P. D.did find this.
handcuffs. So he restrains the men and saves the real savaging for the wife.
is this right?
they found a used condom on both the husbands?
and both had Viagra in their systems and neither had a prescription.
so the unsub gives the men Viagra and then forces them to have sex before he kills them.
and given the timetable, he's gonna strike again soon.
we fly to Akron tonight. Wheels up in 3 hours.
Garcia. What's that?
my go bags.
where are you going? - With you, hopefully.
sir, I think we're all still reeling since JJ left, and we are a man down, and you need a communications liaison.
Garcia-- sir, please, hear me out.
my job overlapped with JJ's the most.
I created that program that she used to present cases.
when you guys were out in the field, she coordinated your needs through me. It makes sense.
Garcia, there are aspects of the job for which you have no training.
you're totally right, but I--I'm willing to learn.
I'll learn how to interact with families and local law enforcement and the media.
sir, I'm willing to tone down my wardrobe choices.
I'm ready to make that sacrifice if you just please give me a chance.
all right. We could explore this on a trial basis. We'll see how things go.
are you up to speed on the case? - Yes.
can you be ready in 3 hours? - I'm ready now.
see you on the plane.
abraham Lincoln said,"whatever you are, be a good one."
I'm just waiting on a few last-minute details.
let' go ahead and get started.
I keep bumping on the fact that he makes a married couple have sex before he kills them.
what is he accomplishing with that?
you know, the stabbing of the wives is almost certainly piqueristic.
the unsub gets sexual gratification from penetration with a knife.
most piquerists are impotent-- men like Albert Fish, Lain Scoular, Andrei Chikatilo.
so for him, it could be a substitute for sex.
the unsub could also be playing a mind game.
neither shot to the husband is clean, so they have to watch what he's doing to their wives as they're dying.
so this guy challenges their manhood by forcing them to have sex, and then mocks them with the overkill.
that kind of psychological torture makes him a sexual sadist.
it would explain the amount of control he exhibits over the crime scene
he plans out every detail.
if he's that precise, he would be just as precise in his victimology.
but he's all over the map in terms of class and race.
well, there must be something else about the couples that attracts him.
something that he couldn't learn by stalking them anonymously.
maybe the couples met the unsub before.
Rossi and Reid, will you handle the family interviews?
morgan and Prentiss, go to the latest crime scene.
we need to learn as much as we can about him, so let's really pin down the M. O.
well, look at you, look at you.
meet your new communications liaison.
trial communications liaison.
Garcia, I don't get to say this often, but I had no idea there was this side of you.
well, I figure since I'm going to have to interact with the mass populace, I should dress in the traditional costume of a mere mortal.
what's wrong? - Oh, it's my contact. It keeps getting weird and...Huh.
there it goes.
no. - Yes. No.
detective Crowley?
miss Garcia. - Yeah.
thanks for coming.
and she emailed pictures of you guys.
agents Hotchner, Rossi, and Dr. Reid, right? It's doctor, not Agent.
she was specific about that.
what else was she specific about?
everything your team needed.
I sent her a list of family members who'd be willing to talk, and your boards are over there, all ready for you to set them up. I even got the push pins you asked for.
excuse me.
are you miss Garcia?
Mr. Keppler.
this is Detective Crowley. He'll show you to the interview room.
Hello, sir. Right this way.
he is such a sweet man.
you contacted the family members already?
Yes. Only two responded back immediately.
that's Robert Keppler's dad, and then Scott Hartway's mom will be here in about an hour.
is that enough time? - Yes. Perfect.
OK. I'm gonna set up the boards unless you need something else.
great. No, we're good. Thank you.
and you were worried.
OK, thank you.
so he has a gun, he gains the upper hand immediately.
he keeps it trained on the wife so the husband has no choice but to surrender.
where does he confront them?
not the parking lot. Too many variables for someone this controlled.
he could have been lying in wait in the backseat, though.
no.
I mean, if they were facing forward, the unsub's back here down low, he pops up with his gun, there's no chance for them to fight back.
he could have used a Slim Jim to get in.
that wouldn't leave any marks.
Yeah, but here's the real trick.
how did he force two people to have sex at gunpoint?
with Viagra, apparently.
Viagra's a vasodilator. It takes at least 30 minutes to get the blood vessels to relax properly.
I mean, Scott's fight or flight response would have kicked in.
his heart's racing, his blood's flowing to all his extremities, but not the right one.
maybe he got them to relax. He tells them he'll let them live if they do this.
this guy has to control everything.
that would include the environment, right?
Oh, he turned the heat all the way up.
he didn't want them getting cold?
this station wasn't one of the presets.
that means he tuned it for them.
it's almost like he went out of his way to make sure they were comfortable.
a sexual sadist wouldn't do that.
we need to take a look at the first crime scene.
can you walk us through a typical day in your son's life?
what do you mean?
the man we're looking for may very well have met Robert and Allison.
can you tell us what they liked to do?
I can tell you those two were married.
to their jobs.
he was lawyer, and she was a pediatrician.
they went to work, they came home.
that was their day. - So he was driven.
Scott was at the Post Office by 7: 00 every morning.
he had his eye on that branch manager office.
he wanted to run the whole zip code.
so did he have enemies at work?
robert stepped on toes to close a deal, I suppose, but he was shooting for v. p. by the end of the year.
he--he'd have made it, too.
was he that way his entire life?
class president 4 years in a row.
so many all-americans...
he ran out of room on his varsity jacket.
what about college?
well, top of his class at Harvard.
made "Law Review" at Yale.
I was very proud.
so both victims were alpha males?
it's the only trait we could find that connects the couples.
we know that female type isn't specific to this unsub, but what if this is?
typically, alpha males only attack other alphas.
that's how the unsub sees himself.
these men are the only competitors he takes seriously.
and the overkill on the wives is expression of control in alpha male terms.
he's proving his dominance over his rival by obliterating their mate.
we need more details about these men's lives. I'll have Garcia pull up more personal information.
detective, have you seen Ms. Garcia?
she's outside talking to a reporter.
guy from the local paper wanted a quote from the FBI.
excuse me.
no comment.
off the record, then.
is the FBI assisting the Akron police in the couple killer case?
OK, first of all, no comment means no comment.
second of all, that name of the killer-- you came up with that name. We didn't come up with that name.
well, forget the name. The name's gone.
just, uh, give me some background and we'll hold the story until you give me the green light.
you'll hold the story? - Absolutely.
have you cleared that with your editor?
uh...of course.
can you get him on the phone?
and the hold also applies to your blog that the paper hosts?
right. That.
you sneaky son of a-- you'll have your story when the Akron police make an arrest.
until then, the FBI has no comment, as Ms. Garcia stated. Thank you.
he lied. He lied to me.
no, he just counted on you not asking the right questions.
why didn't you check with me before you talked to him?
I looked everywhere and I couldn't find you.
and I figured it was one of those things that you would just count on me to handle.
Garcia, I appreciate the initiative, but when it comes to dealing with the press, let me handle things for now.
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
I need all the credit card and phone records for all the husbands.
we think the unsub is targeting them first.
OK. - Thank you.
Hotch, there's something you need to see.
this is the second crime scene.
the unsub took the Hartways to lovers lane.
then he turned the heat up in the vehicle and tuned the radio to a soul music station.
this is the first crime scene.
al Green was in the CD player, candles had been lit.
he's staging the scene. - Control is critical to him. We know this.
but to a different end than we initially thought.
these murders are about the fantasy, only the fantasy isn't sadistic, it's romantic.
well, we profiled from the interviews that he's picking the husbands first. How's that romantic?
alpha males marry the most attractive females.
once he meets the husband, he knows the wife is gonna fit his needs.
we know this unsub is impotent, but what we're seeing here isn't the usual psychological block keeping him from getting aroused. This is physiological.
how can you be sure of that?
he brings Viagra to the crime scenes.
if he wanted, he could pop a pill, let the drug take effect.
instead, he gives it to the husbands. Why?
it's not working for him anymore.
something definitely happened to this guy.
prostate cancer, surgery, something.
but whatever it was, it cut him off from fulfilling his needs, so he's using the couples as surrogates.
so why does he make the husband wear a condom?
well, we don't know that connection yet.
if the theory's right, he's acting out a fantasy in which contraception plays a key role.
until we understand what the role is, we're not gonna find him.
quick!
get the-- baby, get the
No! No! No... No...No...
wait. I'll do what you want.
just don't hurt me, please...
tell me you want me.
I want you.
say it... Like you mean it.
I want you.
do you want me? You do.
you want me. You want me. You want me. You want me.
say you want me. You want me.
I just heard. The unsub shot both victims last night?
the housekeeper found them this morning.
his routine was disrupted. That means he made a mistake.
it also means he's out of control.
he's enraged. He's going to attack again soon.
paul Wilson, spinal surgeon.
alpha male just like the others.
can you just hold on for a moment?
the offensive and defensive wounds all over his body.
he was cuffed behind his back.
he still put up a hell of a fight.
because he knew how. Look.
the wounds extend from his knees to the soles of his feet.
that's full-contact training.
now, where would learn something like that?
my assumption would be a mixed martial arts gym.
MMA has skyrocketed among the men who want the most intense fighting possible.
which our unsub would. It could be where he's finding his victims.
I'll follow up with the families.
maybe she went for the gun in the drawer, forced the unsub to shoot her, and stopped him from following his ritual.
no,'cause there was a muzzle burn on her chest.
he shot her at pointblank range.
OK, you're the unsub, I'm Debra Wilson.
I have to get past you to get to that gun.
but she takes her robe off.
now, your 9-millimeter is right here at my chest.
what am I doing?
she offered herself to him?
well, why would she do that? Why not lock herself in the bathroom or run out the door?
well, survival isn't logical, it's instinctual.
her instincts probably told her that this was her best shot.
OK. She's telling herself she's gonna do whatever is necessary to get out of this alive.
so she's just seen her husband die in front of her.
then she comes on to the unsub?
an overt sexual expression.
Yeah, it's almost flexible. She's gone from one man to the next without hesitation.
he makes the husband wear a condom.
what does that say about him?
that he's protecting himself?
it's a sexual scenario where you're sharing a woman with another man.
am I crazy, or could this guy be a swinger?
he could have been a part of that scene until the impotence kicked in.
and now he's just trying to recreate it.
these couples could have been his old partners.
OK, so here's what I found out.
only Paul Wilson trained at an mma gym, but all the other husbands worked out regularly, from the local YMCA to expensive fitness clubs.
makes sense. Alpha males care about their appearance.
the gym is also a good place to stalk victims.
it still doesn't tell us how he goes from finding husbands in a gym to getting inside their house.
no, but it does give us a list from which we can eliminate.
Yeah, but we've got a bigger problem here.
the unsub's fantasy was interrupted.
at the least, he's hunting again tonight.
at the worst, he'll escalate his violence.
will you ask Crowley to gather his officers. We can give the profile.
Garcia. - Yes, sir.
we've got a possible lead in the husbands' gyms and health clubs. I need a list of everyone in and out.
OK, so employees and members.
no, wider than that. Outside vendors, maintenance, trainers, everybody.
that's a lot
and I'm not done cataloguing husbands' records like you asked me to 'cause I keep getting delayed.
delayed how?
uh, family members calling back, cops with questions.
also, I'm helping Morgan call swing clubs 'cause we thought some of the victims might be swingers.
they're not. By the way, there's more swing clubs in Akron than there really should be.
Garcia, I need you to prioritize this. We need to get ahead of this guy.
he may strike again tonight.
sir, may I please bring Kevin Lynch in?
it could help me get it done like bang.
that's fine, and if for any reason you get stuck, just let me know.
and tell Morgan and Prentiss that we're releasing the profile.
have them give it to everybody that they've met In the swingers community.
Yes, yes, I can do that.
uh, Jehovah's Witnesses?
Oh, no, ma'am.
um... I'm special Agent Prentiss. This is special Agent Morgan.
we're with the FBI.
we heard that you ran, uh, fabulous fun and over 40?
this is the house.
Phil! The FBI is here!
Oh, come in. - Thank you.
sir, I totally appreciate the confidentiality your gym provides for its members, but this is a murder investigation, so obviously-- Hello?
uncooperative.
Kevin, honey, say something helpful.
I'm almost done with members and employees.
outside venders are gonna be tough, though. It looks like a lot of these guys are paid under the table.
I know. W-2s are useless.
look at original service records only.
what is this operating system you're working?
the search parameters are completely backwards.
OK, first of all, I created that program, and second of all, it is a poor carpenter and hacker who blames his tools.
miss Garcia.
paul Wilson's family is here for interviews.
but we're about to deliver the profile. There's no one here to talk to them.
well, they're here.
Uh...Can--can you ask them to wait?
OK. - Pen, are you talking to me?
Kevin, compile.
detective? - Yeah?
I'm sorry. I'll talk to them.
Oh, I miss you, JJ.
this unsub is an emasculated alpha male with a near obsessive-compulsive level of control in his behavior.
and because of the repetition of details at the crime scenes, we know that his ritual is essential to him.
these patterns are how he maintains dominance in a world he feels powerless in, both sexually and socially.
the man we're looking for is a troilist.
do you know what that is?
it means that he gets off on staging a scene and participating in it.
such as recording sexual acts on camera or coming to parties like yours.
the point is the performance.
do you know who his partner is?
uh, partner?
when he comes to the parties.
he has to bring a female companion or he wouldn't get in the door.
see, swing clubs are a matriarchy.
my primary goal as a hostess is to make sure other women feel safe and secure.
there has to be at least as many women as men.
actually, we hadn't considered that.
what else do you know about him?
paul Wilson's attack showed him how physically weak he was, and Debra Wilson's enticement reminded him of how futile his fantasies were.
and as a result of this, this unsub is what we call decompensating.
now, what does that mean?
we use it to describe the collapse of ocd patterns that mentally ill patients use to cope.
once one fails, they generally all do.
in this case, the unsub's ritualized fantasy has stopped working, and that makes him incredibly dangerous.
so what was his fantasy?
two men, one woman-- how would that work?
well, he comes with his female companion.
then he'd most likely invite a man in.
wait a minute. This guy is an alpha male.
wouldn't he be too possessive to share his partner?
sure. Unless he was married.
well, why married?
Oh, because the erotic charge of the role play is the consensual cheating.
you don't control a girlfriend the way you control a wife.
the husband chooses his wife's partner for her.
usually not married.
it makes the cheating hotter.
then at a certain point, he steps in.
and shows his sexual superiority.
he proves to the room and his wife that he's the only one who can satisfy her.
until his impotence destroyed his ability to do that.
suddenly he's not the only one questioning his manhood, she is, too.
so maybe she cheated on him, or maybe she left, but either way, his wife was his first loss of control.
and if he's decompensating, she's the pattern he'll attack next as part of his breakdown.
her or women like her.
the end result of decompensation is a temporary psychotic break.
he'll revisit old patterns to see if they still work.
and when he finds that they don't, he'll be compelled to destroy them and anyone engaging in them.
how are you?
Oh, excuse me.
Hello, Leslie. - James.
what a pleasant surprise.
Where's your wife?
maryann's coming later.
well, you know the rules of my house.
she's right behind me. I swear.
well, she better be.
are you almost done?
I can't look at this any longer.
almost, ma'am.
the gunman tonight, did you know him?
he and his wife Maryann were fixtures here a year ago.
then they just stopped coming.
do you have a last name?
no. We don't share personal details like that.
so you have sex, but you don't ask for last names?
all of the victims here tonight were men.
do you happen to know why? - No.
do you know if he had the chance to shoot any women?
I was in the playroom with my friend.
and we locked the door when the shooting started.
and he came in, and he just looked at me like I was nothing.
so, no, no, I have no idea what he was after.
I'm just glad it wasn't me.
ms. Sanders, if the door was locked, how did he get in?
this was the last victim.
the unsub came from the living room into here.
morgan says the hostess locked herself in here.
it didn't seem to slow him down.
this is a deadbolt. The unsub could have easily shot his way through.
he picked the lock?
he'd only do that out of habit.
the deadbolt's designed for security.
it takes expertise to get past that.
you think he's a locksmith?
we knew he was stalking his victims at the gym, but we never knew how he got into their lives.
but when you're working out, where's the one place you leave everything personal?
in a locker. Once the unsub finds an alpha male, he can pick the lock, get their address off their driver's license, and duplicate their keys in his work van outside.
that's the missing piece to his m. O.
he got everything he needed from these men before they left the shower.
Garcia's already ruled out gym employees and members. How's he getting in?
could be a third-party vendor called in to install the lockers.
and called back when someone loses their key.
all right. Come back to the station. We'll work this up.
Garcia, I need you to pull all the locksmiths that the gym contracts out to.
Oh, that's gonna take some time. - Why?
because I'm still gathering the vendors, and not all the websites list the trainers that work there.
did you call them? - Of course I called them, - But some were cooperative and some weren't, so I-- Garcia, I told you to come to me if you got stuck.
look, you know usually I can do this kind of thing in no time, but this office is a revolving door of people bugging me, and I cannot do two jobs at once!
Oh, my God, sir, I'm so sorry.
Garcia, there are 8 new victims as of tonight, and more people are going to die.
I need you to shut out all distractions and give me everything you've got.
Yes, sir. I'm here. I'm present. Hit me.
the unsub's a locksmith. I need employee rolls-- of lock and key companies.
I'm so on it. - Thank you.
Yeah. - Hotch. We need to rethink this unsub's decompensation.
it's the same thought process that started him hunting alpha males to begin with.
and what does that tell us about where he might be going?
nothing. But it might tell us where he's been.
decompensation means he's returning to his old patterns, his old habits.
maybe he did this before.
after his wife left, he sought out some of her partners and killed them.
you want to look at unsolved murders?
Crowley can pull them for us, match them based on the unsub's caliber.
good. You might also need to give Garcia a hand working the locksmith angle.
is there some reason she can't cover that on her own?
she's juggling two jobs. She might need some help.
Yeah. Yeah, I appreciate that.
thank you for the information. Ok. Bye-bye.
how are you holding up?
um, the gyms found out about the massacre, so now they're giving me information on the locksmiths, and that's a whole other can of worms.
and... I'm fine.
Morgan, people are going to die because of me.
that's not true. - Yes, it is. JJ did so much.
I am in so over my head, I'm swimming-- oh, my God, I hate these things.
here, let me help. Take them out. Where's your saline?
front pocket of my bag.
you know what your only mistake has been since you started?
Oh, hooray. More criticism.
you are trying to replace JJ.
nobody can replace JJ. Now take the other one out, too.
I'm not trying to replace her.
I'm trying to do this job the way she'd want it done.
you know what JJ would want?
she'd want you to find a way to do this job on your own terms.
play to your strengths.
OK, all my extensive knowledge of operating systems and Internet protocol is not really gonna help me out here.
that's not what I'm talking about.
what are you talking about?
you need to go O. G. Original Garcia.
Derek Morgan, I'm a little blind right now, but it appears the rough blur that is you just threw out my only pair of contact lenses.
there she is. I know you.
how often do I tell you I love you?
every day. It's implied.
Now...The locksmiths.
can I help?
you just did.
I know what to do.
deacon's lock and key. This is Deacon.
hello. This is Penny Garcia.
I'm with the phone company.
I paid this month.
Oh, we're the phone company, so we know that.
I'm calling because one of your employees is past due, and he listed you as his most recent employer.
I don't have any employees.
well, that settles that, then. I'm just going to turn this over to the irs.
no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I have a few guys I free-lance out to. Who are you looking for?
well, I'm glad you asked,'cause this is my pickle.
I have a gentleman that uses a bunch of different last names, but he keeps using the same first name, James, over and over.
and the password is Maryann on all of his accounts.
he wouldn't happen to be working tonight, would he?
supposed to. Didn't show.
OK. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
I got it! - Got what?
the unsub.
his name is James Thomas.
he did work at all the gyms the husbands went to. Is that not enough information?
Oh, I have so much more.
last year he suffered from a condition called prostatic hyperdysplasia.
routine surgery took a wrong turn, snip snip, they had to remove the whole prostate tamale.
boss says he didn't show up for work today, but this... Is his home address.
Garcia, you should have let me know before you contacted his employer.
otherwise, well done.
we need a SWAT team at this address.
I'm on it.
Yes.
FBI! We're coming in!
clear. Clear.
all clear.
show me your hands.
who are you? - Maryann Thomas.
James Thomas' wife?
Where's your husband? - I don't know!
he left for work this morning.
there's a gun locker in the closet. It's empty.
get up. You're gonna help us find him.
please, tell me what this is about.
this is who your husband has killed so far.
recognize that last crime scene?
that's Leslie Sanders' house, where you and James used to swing.
James is not a...
he wouldn't do that. - He would, Maryann.
he would because he knows he's not the father of your baby.
that's not true. James is the father.
she's not going to give him up.
she's the wife of an alpha male. She depends on him psychologically.
is there any chance that the unsub is the father?
Garcia said the prostate surgery was over a year ago, and there's no record of insemination.
so how do we get her to admit it?
we need to ground her back into reality, give her something to hold on to for truth.
did you get those files we asked for, the unsolved murders?
Yeah. I can have them here in 5 minutes. - Great, thanks.
if the unsub did kill someone in those files, it's most likely the father of her child.
if it's an old swinging partner, he'd be easy to track down.
that's risky. If we show her the files and he's not in there, we could lose her for good.
Yeah, but if the father is in there, it could shake her loose.
that baby is the only thing she would prioritize over her husband.
I think I can do it. I can get her to cooperate. - How?
right now, two alpha males are in there attacking her marriage.
she'll react the same way to anyone challenging her husband's dominance.
but I'm not a threat. I think she'll listen to me.
so, I read this pretty fascinating theory recently.
it said that humans weren't designed to be monogamous, that in our hunter-gatherer phase, women took several mates.
the idea was that if the men in the tribe didn't know who the father was, they'd all be more invested in the child.
interesting, right? - I guess.
truthfully, your lifestyle is, um, it's a sociological marvel.
don't get me wrong. I don't judge it or you.
but I do think that the only reason you got into that was to make your husband happy.
just like you only got pregnant after his surgery to make him happy, only, I don't think that it's working.
that's not true.
James is overjoyed to be a father.
so he didn't change around, like, month 4 or 5 of the pregnancy when you started to show?
he didn't get moody or withdrawn or anything?
how about last night, when he came home with cuts and bruises?
didn't you ask him about that? - No.
so, Maryann, I know this is hard to hear, but I think that your pregnancy drove your husband to try to recreate those parties so he could feel in control again.
only, instead of swinging, he's killing people.
why won't you people listen to me?
he's not capable of doing that.
how about killing the man who got you pregnant? Do you think he's capable of that?
no. Because you'd be lying.
this is his baby.
these files are recent unsolved murders, men who have been killed since you conceived.
now, if I'm right about your husband, I think that the father of your child is somewhere in here.
Bob Atkins? Is it him?
I can't believe this.
you don't give up, do you?
you just can't accept the fact that my husband and I love each other.
Yes, we have an unconventional marriage, but that's not a crime.
we have a strong relationship. James respects me.
he would never do anything
it went straight to voice mail. He must have turned it off.
Maryann, we need you to tell us what you and your husband used to do before you got married.
what your habits were.
you mean like where we went on dates?
no, your sexual habits.
think of it. You don't just jump into swinging.
most people have games building up to it. What were they?
he'd sometimes pretend to pick me up.
what does that mean?
we'd meet at a bar.
I'd arrive and he wouldn't be there. He was in the back watching me.
what were the names of the bars you went to?
just one. Dunley's. It's at the town mall.
and how did the game end?
he'd make me dress provocatively.
he wanted guys to hit on me, and then when I'd show some interest
James would step in, seduce you back to him?
he's in the middle of the bar.
there's no way to take him down without risking collateral damage.
if we go in there, he'll start shooting up the place.
he'll do that anyway. This guy's looking for a spark.
then we'll need a distraction.
what are you doing?
he's gone back to his old patterns.
he wants to play the game he played with his wife.
Debra Wilson played that game and it got her killed, Prentiss.
all right, keep his focus off the crowd long enough for us to take him down.
you guys better have my back.
we will.
I thought that was you.
how's Maryann?
Oh, you don't remember me, do you?
we met at a-- a party.
we did?
Yeah. That was a-- that was a crazy night.
I'll bet it was.
Emily. Um, it was Halloween.
OK, tell me if this rings a Bell.
uh, you asked if we were interested in Maryann, and then you and I watched for a while, and then you joined in.
Brian didn't stop talking about that for weeks.
look, look, look, look. I'm sorry, I really don't remember you.
it's ok.
so, do you still hit the scene?
no, I don't.
Yeah, me neither.
I came tonight, uh, hoping to find a real man.
lucky for me I found you.
so we have met?
so where's Brian?
Oh, he's not around anymore.
Yeah. Well, that happens.
lose your boyfriend.
the scene will definitely do that.
you know, I'm not that torn up about it.
there'll be other boyfriends.
you know, there's only, uh, only one way to make the lifestyle really work.
you gotta choose someone who's stable.
who's, uh, secure.
in fact, Maryann and I have a, uh, little secret system we worked out.
you want to know what that is?
I always choose husbands for her... never boyfriends.
I don't know you.
and you don't know me.
move, move.
FBI! Nobody move!
the situation is under control. You're not in danger.
you need help?
are you all right?
Tell...Tell...Tell Maryann... Tell Maryann...
I will.
Garcia... - Sir, I'm scanning the open case files.
my plan is to have this office paperless in a month.
that can wait.
when gideon left the bau, I found myself taking on too much responsibility.
and I quickly realized that I could only do the job that I was good at.
I've seen you give everything to this case and to this team for the last few days, but the truth is, we need you here.
Oh, thank God.
sir, I do not want that job.
I mean-- I want part of the job.
I want the part that keeps me here,'cause here I'm Mozart, but out there, I was like a monkey playing the trumpet, and you guys need Mozart.
you did fine.
what if we split up the job?
you can handle intake and resources here at Quantico, we can cover the rest in the field, and when we need you, you'll still travel with us.
you can do that? - Of course.
but I let you down.
in no way whatsoever.
I kind of lost my marbles out there.
Garcia, when you applied for this job, you gave me your resume on homemade pink stationery.
I realized then that you were...unique.
and I wouldn't want you to change that.
good night. - Good night.
detroit
no, don't do this! Don't do it!
No! No! No! No!
why are you doing this?! Get me out of here!
Where'd you go?
why are you doing this to me?!
please don't do this, man.
No! No, please!
can't somebody help me? Help me!
No!
help!
Hey, jack, are you ready? We gotta go.
Hey, where's the costume? - It's itchy.
did you try the long sleeves on underneath?
I don't want to be spider-man anymore.
why not? - I don't know.
OK. Well, you have to make up your mind by tomorrow, ok?
OK. - Ok.
you did a good job on the cookies.
teamwork, right? - Teamwork, right.
can i have one?
you want a cookie? Can i have a cookie?
what do you want, black cat or a pumpkin?
black cat. - Black cat. Good choice.
the cool thing about halloween is that it's a uniquely american holiday.
I mean, despite it's obvious origins in the celtic festival of samhain and the christian all saints day, it really is a melting pot of various immigrants' traditions and beliefs.
it became a little more commercialized in the 1950s with trick-or-treat, and today it rivals only christmas in terms of popularity.
all i asked was what he was doing this weekend.
I'm toying with the notion of either going to the edgar allan poe shadow puppet theater or the reenactment of the 19th century phantasmagoria.
I don't want to know. - Oh, yeah, you do.
Phantasmagorias are these amazing pre-cinema projected ghost shows invented in france, where the showman attempted to spook the audience using science magic.
and it just so happens that i have an extra ticket.
tempting.
guys, i wouldn't have to worry about losing my feminine curves if you all paid more attention to all the trees we're consuming around here.
when did you become an eco-freak?
baby, i was born green. - We're going to detroit.
it's halloween weekend.
arson investigators have noticed a 3-year trend - in the days leading up to halloween. - Devil's night.
this unsub is killing only these 3 days out of the year.
how's he doing it? - He's burning his victims alive.
he's abducting seemingly random people and dumping their bodies in abandoned parts of town.
he struck again last night.
Yeah. Tony torrell, 40. he lives in the suburbs, but he was found 20 miles away in the rivertown district.
he's attacking the city at its most vulnerable time.
what does he do during the rest of the year? - He's dormant.
you know, arsonists are typically white males between 17 and 25
who can't stay away from fire.
Yeah, they're addicted to it and there's no rehab.
and they target dwellings, not people.
so you're saying he burns his victims alive but he's not an arsonist?
fire is simply his weapon.
and devil's night gives him the perfect cover to kill.
then we've got 48 hours before he disappears again.
well, his last victim was athletic.
he wouldn't be easy to subdue.
the offender must be just as strong or might have an upper hand if he's younger.
still, how does he transport his victims across the city and get them inside buildings without being noticed?
niccolo machiavelli wrote,"if an injury has to be done to a man, "it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.
now, i thought devil's night was halloween eve.
the moniker "devil's night" is somewhat deceiving.
in detroit, it's actually a 3-day citywide cultural phenomenon, complete with masks, chaos, and costumes.
say that 3 times fast. - Sounds like mardi gras.
Yeah, a violent one. Vandals and amateur arsonists literally set hundreds of fires.
who burns their own city?
it started as pranks in the 1930s but escalated in the 1970s with disenfranchised youth.
well, given today's economy, it must be a free-for-all.
they've got record-breaking unemployment and foreclosures, leaving a lot of displaced, desperate people.
and every single one of these victims suffered unimaginable pain.
I'm sure that's what gets him off, watching them burn.
it gives him power and control.
the top of the whodunit list is first responders.
firefighters, arson investigators, cops, and paramedics.
civil servants with a hero complex.
all of whom will be helping us.
this guy's angry. - Aren't they all?
not like this. Have you seen these?
extreme anger usually manifests from a quick temper, but this guy's patient.
I'm gonna ask garcia to notify us the minute that someone's reported missing.
burns 3 people annually. It's like his christmas.
and the rest of the year he just plans
targeting his victims and then choosing the buildings he wants to kill them in.
there's a flaw in his plan. We know about it.
detrout
we're stretched as it is, but we've set up a joint task force with the detroit p. d. to catch this guy.
it's pretty extensive.
I'd say don't profile me, but you're in a roomful of suspects, right? a city full.
victims abducted across every socioeconomic divide.
and this son of a bitch is about to burn a few of them alive.
problem is, we've gotta catch up.
and we know he's gonna be watching.
well, we're gonna bust him this year.
we've got two agents on the way to last night's crime scene.
great. I'll meet them there.
I hope we find something soon.
it gets dark early this time of year.
and we'll head to the morgue.
hope you have a strong stomach.
gasoline was the accelerant?
gas vapors collect in a low, enclosed space.
when he ignited, those vapors burned down to his bone.
we call this a fourth-degree burn.
there's a fracture on the back of his skull. - That's right.
was that postmortem?
no, it was antemortem bruising. He was struck from behind.
blitz attack.
what's this on her face? - Charred fabric.
all of the victims have the same material on them.
the fire fused the original garment to his flesh, then burned away, leaving behind these remains.
he's covering their faces?
that's my best guess, yes.
he doesn't want his victims looking at him, even though we wants to watch them die.
it could be a sign of guilt or inadequacy.
now, wouldn't a guy like this want to see the terror in their eyes?
instead, he keeps them in the dark.
he's covering their faces and setting them on fire.
it's an execution.
it's easy to see why he sets fires down here.
it's completely isolated.
he can beat, torture, or burn somebody and nobody would hear it.
I never thought the fbi would be here for our fine city's tradition.
I'm al garner with the dfd.
agents morgan and prentiss.
I guess devil's night keeps you pretty busy, huh?
not as much as it did in the eighties.
used to get up to 600, 700 fires back then.
in 3 days? - Down to 115 last year.
it still takes everything we got, but fortunately we've had some help.
have the police increased their patrols in the rivertown district?
I wish they could, but the city's reeling from budget cuts.
no. Detroit's finest is a community group with over a thousand volunteers.
a thousand volunteers?
well, that just added another thousand names to garcia's list.
do you think he's one of them? - Can't rule anyone out.
what is this place?
it's an old engine factory.
it's massive. And medieval.
from the industrial age, when this city was pumping out more cars and hit songs than anyplace else in the world.
this is where we found tony's charred remains.
the char pattern tracks back to here.
that's where he stood when he started the fire.
not the best vantage point.
there's your escape exit.
Yeah, except he didn't want that.
he needs to watch the show.
this is the moment he's been waiting for all year.
one where he doesn't feel inadequate or rejected.
so he watches as long as he can.
Yeah, but fire's unpredictable.
every second in here he's putting his own life at risk.
and this guy's obviously confident that he can get out of here before it's too late.
but there was a fire alarm. My men were here in 5 minutes.
and he knew it. - How?
this unsub doesn't leave anything to chance.
he knows exactly how long he's got with his victims.
he probably knows response times or at least listens to them.
all units, be advised of a robbery in progress at 9760 east mills.
this is your man dj cutz with an instant blast.
the feds are in town cracking down on this year's devil's night.
so i'd advise everyone to stay off of the streets and keep them radios locked to fm 99 detroit.
the first time i looked at these victims on the map, none of it made sense.
7 different victims, various ages, sex, and ethnicity.
what do you see now? - The first victim...
often tells us the most. - Tommy proctor.
well, his rap sheet is longer than the nile.
it looks like he's always walked on the dark side.
the first kill inspired him. What's different about it?
two things. First of all, his body wasn't found for days.
he was buried deep in the building.
that often tells us that they know each other.
not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn them.
because the unsub didn't realize how difficult it is to actually burn a human body.
or it's overkill. He wanted proctor to suffer the most.
which definitely makes it personal.
if he knew the first victim, it's a good chance he knew them all.
we just have to find out how.
we can start by talking to tony torrell's wife.
how you doing? - Uh... I'm fine.
uh, i'm here to see agent rossi.
he's going to be with you in just a few minutes. I'm agent prentiss.
Oh, i'm kiersten torrell. Uh...
my husband tony was killed last night.
I know. And i'm very sorry. May i sit down?
Oh, yeah.
are-- are you working on his case?
Yes, i am.
is there a picture of him in your folder?
I want to see him.
Kiersten, uh, your husband was very badly burned.
I don't think that's a good idea.
what do you mean, he was burnt?
the person who did this uses fire as a weapon.
was tony set on fire alive?
we don't know that
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, this can't be happening.
next week was our anniversary.
I'm so sorry. - Are you married?
no, i'm not, and i can't imagine what you're going through.
but everything you tell us can help us find the person who did this to tony.
I know this is hard, but i want you to try to remember that when you're talking to agent rossi.
now, i'd like you to close your eyes and relax.
I want to walk you through an exercise that's going to help you recall everything that happened last night.
what, like hypnosis? - No, no, no. Not at all.
now, just close your eyes and do the best that you can. Ok?
all right. Think about last night.
you and tony, you went to the halloween festival in greektown.
what time was it? - Uh, around 9: 30.
crowded?
Yeah. Uh, there were drums and loud music, some people wore costumes.
Tony and i went to the festival every year.
we actually met there when we were in high school.
but this year we decided not to dress up.
what is it?
a kid dressed in a mask jumped out, scared me.
it made tony laugh.
Where's his mama? - what type of mask?
uh, round, like a baby.
OK. What do you see next?
fire.
they were grilling lamb, and, uh, people were cheering.
all right. It was a greek restaurant.
baby, me and gyros? No, thanks. - What?
I'm gonna go check out this mexican food.
Oh, baby, no. - Baby, i'm be right back.
all right. I'll come and get you. - All right.
now, do you remember anyone in the crowd, anyone that didn't fit in?
no. But to be honest, i was already looking at the menu.
all right, that's good. Now, don't look up from the menu. Just listen to me.
when you love someone and they step away, there's an instinctive response to glance up to make sure that they're still there.
now, you did that last night even if you don't remember. Ok.
you're getting ready to place an order.
I already know what i'm getting. I'm getting the gyro.
Kiersten, where's tony?
he's at the mexican restaurant.
is someone around him?
Yes. Uh, but i can't really make out his face.
what about his body? Is it young? Is it old?
uh... 25 maybe.
wait.
he's wearing a mask. - Like the kid?
no, no, no, no, no.
it only covers one side of his face.
his ear is gone.
and, um...
what do you see?
it's a black guy. He's black.
you make him sound like he's freddy krueger or something.
no, but i do think he's severely burned.
it explains why he chooses this time of the year. He doesn't have to hide his scars.
what about his victims?
he's punishing them for wronging him.
wronging him? What about his second victim?
have you looked at josephine davis' life?
she was the nicest woman in the world.
how did she wrong this guy?
he's had interactions with all of his victims, some more personal than others.
so he's acting out of revenge.
kiersten and tony didn't even speak to him.
maybe not that night, but at some point in the past.
now, wait a minute. Josephine was abducted from her husband.
Tony was abducted from his wife.
you think these couples represent the happiness he covets?
or something he lost.
he's a young guy with a deformity. Major insecurities come with that.
a trauma like that would be devastating for him and anyone in his life.
daddy?
daddy? Daddy!
please, please, daddy!
daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
daddy, please!
do you know how rare it is for an arsonist to be a burn victim?
less than 3. 5%.
this guy's not an arsonist. He's a serial killer who uses fire.
and that choice of weapon tells us that he's aggressive, driven, and destructive, just like fire itself.
but why would someone so controlling choose the most unpredictable weapon?
this juxtaposition tells us there's more going on with him than we realize.
he's probably experienced some kind of loss these past few years that started him down this path.
we should look at accidents where couples were burned.
we're talking about hundreds of fires.
focusing on ones where gasoline was the accelerant.
leaving his victims in the heart of rivertown, in the center of these buildings themselves, may be subconscious on his part, but it says that this affected his very core.
all right, hold on. Somebody else has just been abducted.
how do we know this is our guy?
because his daughter said a monster took her daddy away.
kaman, come on, man. What are you doing?
my little girl's back there. You gotta let me go.
the victim's name is christopher edwards.
he's 35. he lives in the suburbs.
what part? - birmingham.
how far is that from the rivertown district?
not more than 40 minutes. He might already be inside.
let's lock it down. We'll trap him.
I'm going down there. - i'll go with you.
Garcia, have detroit p. d. set up roadblocks.
got it.
Chris edwards is a husband, he's a father, he's a general contractor.
I would check any subcontractors who've worked with him.
OK, that is a humungous list. What do you want me to do with it?
anything that requires flames
plumbers, electricians, welders.
did he fire a welder recently?
OK.
uh, he's been using vinnie's welding and fence, but he hasn't hired them back in months.
list of employees coming up.
it's still a lofty handful.
OK, we think he's been following the investigation.
look at volunteers with detroit's finest.
OK, i'm crossing employees with volunteers. Nothing.
come on, baby girl, keep checking. There's gotta be a connection here.
OK, i'm gonna long-shot it and i'm gonna cross the michigan business directory with the payroll company and see if i still got what it takes to find stuff.
and i do. His name's kaman scott.
you got an address? - I'm working on that.
kaman. Kaman, come on, man.
kaman, you gotta let me go. Please, let me go.
what do you want? I'll give you anything you want.
you want money? You want a job?
just don't do anything stupid, man, all right?
damn it, come on, man!
OK, from the look of kaman scott's early years, he was on a fast track to be some kind of hoodlum bad boy super convict, but something happened in 2004 that made him change his evil tune, 'cause then there's no arrests, there's no suspicions, there's no sign of rehab, but he totally cleaned up.
maybe that's when he met someone.
has he ever been arrested with a man named tommy proctor?
Yeah, once, uh, 2002...
Yikes, and then they collided again in 2005, like literally collided.
kaman was in an accident and his car blew up.
well, there's your gas accelerant.
he was hit by that guy, tommy proctor.
there's your revenge.
twist of fate. The life he left behind came back to haunt him.
so tommy walks away without a scratch and kaman suffers a ton of third-degree burns, had a boatload of skin grafts, was in a coma for a couple of months, lost his apartment.
Oh, and then there's that guy-- his landlord was tony torrell.
so we were right. He does have a revenge list.
what about family, friends, acquaintances?
no, that kaman is a lone wolf.
and his address just came up. Big bad lives at 5923 mills.
clear here. - Clear.
it's like a cave.
this guy hides out all year long.
with burns like that, he's probably sensitive to light.
and his own skin.
when you look around, there's not a mirror in sight.
this guy doesn't want any reminder of what he looks like.
there's nothing personal in here.
well, we said he'd have nothing to live for.
for a planner like kaman, tonight's abduction was irrational.
he went on private property and took chris edwards with a witness present.
maybe he's finally starting to feel the pressure and he's reactive.
more than that, he's meticulous.
he'd have a plan if he got cornered.
he'd have an endgame.
well, he already killed the man he blames for his accident.
the other victims are slights compared to that.
and now he needs to hurt the person that hurt him the most.
the one who drives all of this. The one who broke his heart.
Yeah, but who the hell is that?
I swear i won't tell anybody about this.
son of a bitch! Oh, god!
I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry. It wasn't my call.
No! What are you doing?! What are you doing?!
no, kaman, please, no!
Oh, god! Let me go!
kaman scott worked for chris edwards. He was fired 7 months ago.
why did he kill him here?
roadblocks forced him out of his comfort zone. Anything in the van?
welding equipment, cans of gasoline.
and a cage.
I'm getting everyone in the city down here on this.
without his car, he's going to lie in wait until he can't anymore.
then he's gonna lash out again.
Prentiss. I think i found something.
what do you got? - A girl.
there's two more of the same girl in here.
Oh, jeez, we gotta find out who she is.
if this guy's feeling cornered, all bets are off.
tonight's his last chance to get revenge on anyone who's ever wronged him.
she's most likely his next target.
Garcia, we're gonna send you some photographs. - What do you want me to do with them?
blow up the background, see if you can find anything that tells us who this girl is.
I'll hit you back.
we're closed! - No, you not.
not to me.
boy, what's wrong with you? Get out.
not tonight.
where is she? Where is tracy?
kaman, i said... Get out.
I can't.
I can't do that tonight. They comin' after me.
what have you done?
I just need to see her.
I told you, don't come back in here.
it's over.
son... You need to get some help.
don't you do it, old man!
where is she?!
you go to hell!
you gonna burn.
Garcia. - Friends, we're on 3-way.
what's going on?
Hotch, we found some pictures of kaman's girlfriend at his apartment.
so i blew up those pictures.
in one of them she appears to be in a restaurant, so i zoomed in on the sign that says "o" apostrophe "s,
cross-checked that with restaurants in the area, and there are 5 diners.
3 are in the suburbs, 2 are in highland park, - and one is in rivertown. - What's the name?
Jay-mo's. And this appears to be kaman's and that girl's favorite place 'cause all the pictures were taken there.
have you heard of jay-mo's? - It's a few blocks from here.
good work, garcia. We're on the way.
you're sick, kaman. - We done talkin'.
this ain't the way. - You tell me where she is.
she ain't with you, i know where she is.
don't do it. Leave tracy alone. Kaman.
it's too late for her.
and it's too late for you.
Hotch, a fire alert just went out, it's at jay-mo's diner.
backup's on the way. - There isn't time.
all units, 565 east jefferson.
I repeat, all units, 565 east jefferson.
this is lieutenant al garner, requesting available fire and ems units.
we got a man inside. Requesting additional alarms.
repeat, all units, 565 east jefferson.
bp's 84 over 36.
the owner's car was stolen.
I need to ask him some questions.
he's in and out of consciousness.
I'm with the fbi. Can you give me a thumbs-up for yes and a thumbs-down for no?
did kaman scott do this to you?
we have 15 minutes to get him to the hospital.
do you know this girl?
don't let him. Please stop him.
is tracy nearby? - Yes. Yes. Get him.
go, go. Resuscitator. Ok, let's move.
Hotch, you ran into a burning building?
I didn't have a choice. Her name's tracy. Kaman's trying to find her.
that man put his life on the line to protect her.
so she means something to him.
she means everything.
got to finish the dishes.
all right, well, hurry up.
jay-mo's real name is james morris.
he was married to loretta butler.
does he have any children? - Yes, they has one daughter.
her name is tracy anderson. She was born in 1987.
why does she have a different last name?
when james' wife died, his sister susan anderson adopted tracy.
and where is she now? - She currently lives in ohio.
no, he says she's nearby. Where do the andersons live?
uh, indian village. - That's 3 miles away.
let's go.
here you go, hon. I found a few more glasses for you.
Tom. Oh, my god, tom!
where is tracy?
sorry. I keep trying the anderson house, but the line's busy.
he must already be there.
Garcia, have any fires been reported in the area?
negative, but medics and fire suppression are on the way.
good. Tell them to stand by.
Roger that. Sir, there's one more thing i gotta tell you.
what is it?
now let's just get honest with each other.
Where's tracy?
she's not here. - You're lying. I know she's back.
Tracy's going to medical school in ohio.
I don't believe a damn word come out your mouth.
we have no reason to lie.
it's been 5 years, kaman. She's moved on with her life.
why can't you just accept that?
shut up!
I'm calling backup.
if anybody moves, we're in trouble.
we need a shooter.
we're here. Your man wants everyone to hold their position.
we need a single rifle.
I say again, all units, hold your position.
copy that.
this is the street.
Hotch is going inside.
and he's on his own.
Hotch won't do anything to spin him.
it's not kaman i'm worried about.
this isn't his first time at the dance. We gotta trust him on this.
kaman, why are you doing this?
we never did anything to you.
you kept tracy away from me.
look what you've done.
what you're about to do now.
I wasn't always like this.
people don't change, kaman.
this is all your fault.
baby, you can't keep blaming the world for what happened to you.
baby, look at me. Look at me.
what... What is going on?
I needed to see you.
and this is how you do it?
you abandoned me. You walked away from me when i needed you the most.
I'm sorry. - That's not good enough!
after the accident, i had to get my life together.
and what about my damn life?
it took me 2 years to get back on my feet.
you were the only thing that kept me going.
what happened to you?
what do you think happened to me?
mommy?
who else is here?
mommy, what's wrong?
that's my sister's son.
uh, go back upstairs, baby. Go back upstairs. - Wait, wait, wait.
he said mama.
the boy's confused, kaman.
is that your son?
no, kaman.
don't you stand in front of me and lie to my face.
kaman, drop it.
you shoot me, i drop this and they burn. Then what?
you move, you die.
I'm already dead. I ain't got nothin' else to live for.
Tracy, you need to tell him.
tell me what? What the hell's going on here?
he needs to know.
while you were in a coma, i found out i was pregnant.
no...
I didn't know what to do. I thought you were gonna die.
baby, i'm so sorry.
you're telling me...
that's my son?
kaman, you don't want to do this in front of your son. Put it down.
baby, if you don't do it for me, do it for him.
don't you want to know his name?
what's your name?

dad, don't look at me.
I'm not looking. Are you almost ready? - Yes.
do you need any help? - No.
OK.
whoa. That is definitely not spider-man.
he's not a real superhero.
he's not?
OK, i give up. Who are you supposed to be?
I'm you, daddy.
come here, buddy.
I believe humanity was born from conflict.
maybe that's why in all of us lives a dark side.
some of us choose to embrace it.
some have no choice.
the rest of us fight it.
and in the end, it's as natural as the air we breathe.
at some point, all of us are forced to face the truth.
ourselves.
for me that day has come.
my god! You look so beautiful.
no, no, no, don't cry. Your mascara will bleed.
look at you. So perfect.
my hands... I -- I can't feel my hands.
please, cut me loose.
she has that something special so few have these days, don't you think?
what do you want from me?
what you desire most.
I saw it the moment I set eyes on you.
saw what?
fame.
you will never look more beautiful than this moment right now.
I was 18 when I faced a man who chose to embrace his dark side, and by doing so, he took my humanity.
every day since I have put on a mask to hide what now suffocates me.
the truth.
and nothing speaks louder than the truth.
out of the shadows, a taxi pulls into the alleyway.
she moves into the light, radiant, captivating.
out of the shadows, Robert sees her.
never has she looked more beautiful than this moment right now.
there's a sadness to her.
for a moment, I didn't think you'd come.
I had to.
what is it?
what if...
what if all we have is all we were meant to be?
No! No. No. It's had.
past tense. Had. Not have. Try it again.
I can't.
not like this.
don't cry.
don't cry.
otherwise you'll relieve the audience.
fight back the tears and they'll cry for you.
untie my hands. Let me move. I'll get it. I swear.
hold the moment and you hold the audience.
what if all we had was all were meant to be?
my love, oh, my love, to my grave I will carry you in my heart.
Oh, wait, please! Please, let me try it one more time!
this is all you were ever meant to be.
no, I can do it.
I promise.
you'll never grow old.
no, well, wait, wait. Just give me one more chance.
you should leave now. - I can do it! Oh, god.
please, no, let me do it one more time, please.
Oh, god, I don't want to die!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
get out.
get out before i call the police.
I called them.
and they'll be here, but not before I'm done.
done? Done with what?
nine girls you raped and you butchered.
you took from them what you took from me.
but I survived.
you should have killed me, Clarence.
detective Croft?
I've seen a lot over the years, but nothing like this.
like what?
I didn't notice it at first, but then when I saw it, I knew I had to call you.
look at her face, Prentiss.
Yep. - I guess you guys have seen it all.
thought I had.
what do you make of it?
nothing good.
all right, listen, I need wide-angle shots of her body, torso, close-ups of her face and her mouth.
whoever did this has a mind I don't want to understand.
that's a luxury we can't afford.
Kelly Landis went missing 3 days ago.
2 days ago, the Georgetown "Monitor" received this.
so whoever took this, took kelly.
and wanted the world to know it.
is that you?
where was she found?
uh, she was found in Georgetown, in an alley, late last night.
I sent Morgan and Prentiss.- Only one victim?
it's what he did to her that concerns me.
morgan sent these, also late last night.
he and Prentiss are waiting in the district.
the body seems posed.
left arm raised... Oh... that's a first.
I see your concern.
what? - A photo wasn't all he took.
Reid, what? - Her lips have been removed.
Oh, my god.
maybe a trophy. - Maybe he ate them?
OK, now I have that memory burned in my mind for the rest of my life.
you asked.
the photo he sent to the "Monitor" and the way her body's posed and the mutilation, it must be a representation of someone.
at least by sending a photo, the media's opened a line of communication.
now that he's got the media's attention, we can expect more of these.
now for this late-breaking news.
Kelly Landis was found dumped in an alley late last night.
and I've been informed her body was mutilated by the killer.
the FBI's behavioral analysis unit has been called in to investigate.
this is Taylor Conwright, WWDC news.
fame will go by, and so long I've had you, fame.
it goes by. I've always known it was fickle, "So at least it's something I experienced, but that's not where I live."
Marilyn Monroe.
33 years. 2 days left to retire.
not once did I have my name in print.
now it's alongside a 22-year-old girl left butchered in an alley.
who found her?
homeless guy.
we need to compile a list of Kelly's direct relatives, friends, co-workers, boyfriends, everyone.
when we got the photo, I expected a ransom, not a body.
this isn't about money.
it's about that. Attention.
by sending in the photo, the unsub's handiwork becomes the center of attention.
it wasn't sent. It was walked into the "Monitor" building.
no one saw a thing.
from here on out, nobody talks to the press.
the last thing we need is the media naming her killer.
it'll have an emotional effect on her killer, but positive or negative, neither one will help.
you know, you guys usually work serial murders.
all we have is kelly. - What you have is unique，in fact.
it's a first for all of us.
Kelly represents someone specific to the unsub.
love and hate in equal measure.
what the hell does cutting her lips off represent?
it's a fetish, an obsession linked either to a profoundly deep love or possibly disgust of lips.
as Morgan pointed out, emotions that are in direct conflict with one another.
it's his signature.
and not one that's on any database.
I love to sit and watch people go by.
you can tell a lot by the way someone walks.
the way they hold their head.
take that lady over there -- the blonde with the ponytail, in the gray dress.
you see her?
that one? - No, no, no. Don't point. That's rude.
that is not a walk.
she's keeping her head down and avoiding eye contact. You know why?
no. - Everyone's in her way.
she's either late for something or... mad at the world.
mad at the world.
that's why I've always told you, Rhett, never have children.
I'm going to go buy some flowers.
you see that, how she glides, you can't take your eyes off her?
how do you walk?
I can show you.
I'd like that.
the office for the Georgetown "Monitor" is here on M street.
Kelly's body was found in Rykers alley here.
3 blocks west is where he hand-delivered Kelly's photo.
and 10 blocks farther east are offices of practically every major media outlet.
why choose the "Monitor"?
he reads it or it's his comfort zone.
you think he lives in Georgetown?
until we find signs of sexual assault, we can't be sure it's a he.
it says that Kelly lives in Alexandria but she works on the hill. Is that correct?
she didn't have a chance. It was her first day as a senate page.
what time was she supposed to report for work?
9 A.M. Neighbors saw her leave in the morning. She didn't have a car.
if she used the bus or the metro, no one saw her.
can we see a copy of the autopsy report?
happening downstairs as we speak.
and we'd like to see a list of everyone you've interviewed so far.
it's on my desk. I'll get it.
Kelly's body was dumped in the district. It's likely that she was abducted and killed here, too.
then he's local.
and MPD's done a comprehensive neighborhood canvass.
they have.
they've probably already interviewed the unsub.
that's a great walk.
really quite wonderful.
my mother says, when you're a movie star, you have to have a walk.
cause when you're on a screen 15 feet high, you better have a good walk.
and when you win that Oscar, you gotta walk across that red carpet like you own it.
stunning.
you think so?
no, I think you're an ugly little girl who has nothing to give to the world.
mommy!
if she was offered food or water, she didn't accept it.
her stomach's empty, and she's dehydrated.
not that she could have accepted anything.
she was restrained.
Dr. Hecht, did you find any signs of sexual abuse?
no. - Cause of death?
suffocation.
but not manual strangulation.
was the mutilation post- or ante-mortem?
post.
never get used to that.
there's something in her throat.
9 A.M. is a busy time of day to be abducting someone.
if she didn't know who took her, that's high-risk.
well, maybe Agent Hotchner and the whiz kid are wrong.
maybe she was brought into the district by somebody she knew.
no one's going to bring a victim into D.C. unless their base of operations is here.
this is definitely his comfort zone.
OK, so day 1, Kelly's abducted.
day 2, the media gets a photo of her.
day 3, her body's found here posed.
this all feels orchestrated.
well, if you orchestrated all of this, wouldn't you want to see it?
why else leave a body here?
I'll get one of my men to film the crowd.
Morgan, isn't this crime scene sealed off?
there's someone in here.
the air must have dislodged it, otherwise I'd have seen it.
Thanks.
a page from a book?
I don't know. It's old paper.
the blood and the saliva has sort of smudged the words.
there's a lot of text.
it appears... to be in old courier.
you know what?
it's typed, not printed.
nothing moves in the street.
a cool breeze and gentle rain do little to silence Robert's beating heart.
from the time Kelly was found, how long had she been dead?
lividity indicates half an hour.
georgetown's where he kept her captive.
Trihalomethane was found in her hair.
chloroform?
who uses chloroform nowadays?
you know, chloroform, the glamour shots-- it all feels like a throwback to another century.
where were you last night?
jail.
there was a homeless man here-- 6 feet tall, beard, late 40s.
impossible.
no, there was definitely somebody right here last night.
this place is my place.
this alley's my home.
ain't nobody down here but me.
do we have a problem here?
the homeless guy who found kelly's body, where is he?
he was right here.
he flagged down a patrol car and he brought them back here.
you mind if I take a look?
do I have a choice?
did you write that on the wall?
son of a bitch wrote on my walls!
no, no, hey, hey! Don't touch that, please, sir.
sir, that is evidence that we need.
come here. - Please.
robert hangs in the shadows." just as his life now hangs in the balance."
"but life without love is no life at all."
we would be awesome together.
aren't we already?
like us, they are perfectly matched, but the are not found on any database.
on what, then?
on that piece of paper found shoved down Kelly's throat.
the same words?
Yeah.
Derek, what is it? You're doing that silence.
it means you're onto something.
I'll call you back.
Hotch was right.
you have interviewed the unsub.
how do you know that?
because the writing on the wall is the same as what was stuffed down Kelly's throat.
the homeless man who found kelly's body wasn't homeless.
excuse me?
he was wearing a disguise.
read to me, Rhett.
you know I love it when you read to me.
I'm tired. I'm so tired.
Rhett, come upstairs and read to me.
scene 43.
you know how I love the way you play it.
Oh, I can't sleep when you don't read to me.
baby, I need you.
coming, mom.
just a minute.
just a minute, I'm nearly done.
get up here now!
agents of the BAU investigate the hill ripper.
why are they saying these things?
you're so much like your father was.
Really? Tell me. Please.
you're weak. - What?
you're weak just like he was.
I did this.
not you! Not my father!
a few bad words from the press and look at you.
why are they saying all these things about me?
he was gutless and he was pathetic, but at least your father knew how to walk like a man!
he gave you nothing.
I've given you my life!
and I am reminded of that every day.
Oh, please!
don't say that!
do you have any idea what you have cost me?
what I could have been?!
Ohh... She looks so much like me.
but she's not you, mom.
look at her.
look at her, mom!
is that the work of a weak man?
in a matter of hours, she'll be more famous than you ever were.
I can't match the words, sir, but if they're from a film, it's got to be the 1950s.
are you sure?
well, the picture that he sent of Kelly to the "Monitor,"
Kelly's makeup, ok, the foundation is like a pearl color and over it is this green powder.
that powder gives it a whiter look.
her eyebrows are plucked, her cheeks are that flushed rose hue that is totally that era.
but what really seals it is the dark eyeliner.
she has bedroom eyes.
that was Marilyn Monroe's trademark.
well, if Kelly's supposed to represent Monroe, then the text we found may be from one of monroe's movies.
Yeah, I know, it's not much, but... - No, no, no, it helps the profile.
sir...
Garcia, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you when I asked about your play.
I certainly didn't mean to.
Oh, oh, I know. I just, um, really, I gotta ask you that you don't share that with anyone, please.
of course.
Oh, and one other thing.
I was thinking, Kelly was missing for 3 days, and most stories
plays and films-- I know, have a 3-act structure.
not unlike your play.
you know, I saw the original production in New York.
well, we sort of adapted it.
good. - Thanks.
penny Hanley, 19. She lives in Arlington, works in an art gallery.
yesterday she didn't make it to work or back home.
she caught the metro to Union Station. Her father dropped her off.
her purse was found a few blocks away on a side street.
it's most likely where she was abducted.
Kelly was taken for 3 days.
if he's holding to pattern, Penny's already on day 2.
today the Georgetown "Monitor" will receive a photo.
whatever happens, we cannot allow another photograph like Kelly's to be published.
we need to get ahead of the media.
they've already named him "the hill ripper."
I want undercover units to lock that building down.
and if you see him, let him walk in.
do not apprehend him before.
we're looking for a white male in his mid to late 40s, approximately 6 feet tall, slim build.
we think he's a local and a loner, and he's most likely unemployed.
he's moving his victims around the city unseen, so we know he has a vehicle.
it's probably an older model, but well maintained.
what does he think this is?
a page from what we believe is a script was found inserted in Kelly's throat.
somehow in the unsub's mind, Kelly seems to have failed expectations.
although there were no sexual interactions ante or postmortem, the removal of the lips is in itself a sexual act.
a behavior which tells us we're dealing with a borderline personality.
based on the obvious theatricality of the case, we think he worked in or around the arts.
3 days may represent a 3-act play, of which Kelly was the star.
Kelly was killed 3 days after she was abducted.
that means Penny may only have a day left.
look up.
I missed one.
Oh, yeah.
you want to see?
I just want to go home.
trust me. I've had a lot of practice.
you look great.
what do you think?
you like it?
she didn't have it.
I thought she did, but she didn't.
you have it in spades, my dear.
I don't want to be famous.
we all want to be famous.
this building has 3 exits -- north, south, and west.
you're here to target a woman, but you don't want to attract attention.
well, standing in the middle gawking at passing women would certainly attract attention.
like you're doing now.
what's that?
just like that, I.Q. of 187 is slashed to 60.
but sitting and reading the paper would give him an excuse to watch without being noticed.
far enough away not to attract attention but close enough to make sure she's the right one.
you know, she works 15 blocks east of here.
her father said she walked through this train station every day.
if he were sitting here, he's on camera.
how many cameras cover the area?
3, but only 2 are operable -- cameras 8 and 7.
can you go back to yesterday around 4 p. M?
OK, camera 7. There she is.
can you bring up camera 8?
can you enlarge it and keep it rolling, please?
see the girl walking in front of the man?
well, he's seen Penny. Look.
can you go back to the exact moment that he sat down?
freeze it right there.
OK, calculating the timecode from the moment that he left the station, he sat there for over 3 hours.
we profiled he has his own vehicle.
it was the only way he could abduct Penny off the street.
3 hours exceeds any parking meter.
get all this footage to Garcia.
this is where her purse was found. This has to be where he grabbed her.
high-risk but possible.
Chloroform's old-school, but it's quick.
they got the guy on tape stalking Penny.
they have an I.D. on him?
not yet. Hotch seems to think that he may have some type of parking permit.
this entire street is parking permit only.
well, maybe he has some kind of work permit.
a guy like this can't hold down a job.
a resident permit would give him all the time he needed.
permits go by zone.
then we need to shut this area down.
this is where he lives.
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!
I want to get this scene on its feet.
to do that, you'll need these.
my toes are pushing at the end.
I need some hat will fit.
I can do this barefoot.
it'll be quieter. You don't want to wake your mother, do you?
good thinking.
some of the lines are missing.
we'll remember them, won't we?
Every...last...word.
your lips are so beautiful.
what's the scene mean to you?
love.
such extraordinary love.
for a moment, I didn't think you'd come.
I had to.
tonight begins the rest of our lives.
what is it?
I can't do this.
of course you can.
I've got the tickets.
the train is coming. We're going to make it.
I'm not so sure.
what is it, my sweet?
what's the matter? Everything's going to be all right.
what if what we had was all we were meant to be?
my love, oh, my love, to the grave I will carry you in my heart.
help me! Somebody help me, please!
help me! Somebody help me!
you broke my nose!
God! Help me! Somebody help me!
No! No-- you sick son of a bitch! No!
you were right.
your toes were too long.
we closed off this entire area. Cops are all over it.
they're going door to door where it's a 5-block-radius with over 2，000 homes.
unless they get lucky, that could take days.
undercover units have staked out the Georgetown "Monitor" building.
Garcia, anything on the footage?
lab is analyzing it frame by frame, but it was pretty clear he doesn't know those cameras are on him.
permits?
cross-checking with the profile, we've got male, late 40s, truck, van or suv.
that brings it down to 600 potentials.
Garcia, what zone covers Rykers alley - M street and Charlotte street?
two zones.
no, that doesn't help.
well, come on, I'm the high priestess of all things digital, but I'm not a god.
what permit covers all zones?
only one. Disabled.
this guy isn't disabled.
maybe he knows someone who is.
a kid on a BMX dropped this off at the "Monitor" a half hour ago.
said a bum gave him 20 bucks.
well, at least it didn't make the news.
it buys us some time, right?
until he finds another way to contact the media.
we'll do it for him. Garcia, I need you here as soon as possible.
sure. What for?
we need him to break cover, get out in the open.
call a press conference with every major media outlet present.
Oh, I am not the one you want in front of that camera.
Yes, you are. Detective, we need every available unit.
you're gonna be fine.
no, I will not be fine. I will suck. I will suck.
and what happens then? - Penelope. Penelope, stop it.
we just gotta buy some time to get ahead of this guy.
he'll be watching, you mean?
I'm gonna be right by your side.
now get your butt over here.
Oh, my god.
every great movie star has a walk.
that's something you'll never have.
sir, I've thought about this and I've decided it's a bad idea.
all you have to do is stay calm.
don't let the room control you.
how am I supposed to do that?
keep your answers short and to the point.
don't comment on the Kelly Landis case. Keep the focus on Penny.
no, sir, I don't think you understand.
I have a phobia about having a video camera even pointed at me.
I get all nervous and I start to panic and I forget what I'm gonna say and my hands get all sweaty and then my hands start to shake.
my hands are shaking right now.
I cannot do things I am not good at, and I am not good at being in a room full of strange people.
that's why I stay in a room 6 by 9 feet. I feel safe there.
Garcia, what about the Tolgate Theater? - Tolgate Theater?
what's that? - It's a small repertory theater in Dean Street.
where they do a lot of-- -Reid, we know what it is.
that is not the same thing.
Garcia-- - I-- I can't even look at you right now.
I am mad. I asked you not to say anything.
we need him to see a face and a look that he recognizes.
well, he likes blondes, and I'm red now.
we can change that.
toward the end, Morgan's gonna hand you a note.
take a moment, let the group settle...
and when you have everyone's attention, read it out.
you're gonna be fine.
you'll be great, red.
this isn't about the unsub. It's about the girls.
for him, it's all about making Penny famous.
then aren't we helping him realize his dream?
come on.
we get this right, we end that dream.
the press is calling him the hill ripper.
they're gonna want to sensationalize this story even further.
now, they're gonna ask you how long he kept kelly.
they're gonna ask you how she died.
did he stab her?
did he torture her?
did he rape her?
how many others has he killed?
Garcia, you have to make it about Penny.
you let whoever has her know that the entire world is watching, and then you make Penny the star.
all we gotta do is get this guy to move.
you can do this, baby girl.
give me your bag.
OK.
penny Hanley went missing 2 days ago. We have received over 3,000 calls.
her family is obviously deeply worried and is looking forward to her prompt and safe return.
isn't Penny Hanley yet another victim of the hill ripper?
right now, all we know is that Penny is missing.
who sent that photo in just like the Kelly Landis case?
we'd like to take this opportunity to reach out to the public.
penny was last seen here, leaving Union Station.
you mean she was taken by the hill ripper.
rumors are that Kelly Landis was found with her lips cut off.
we are not prepared to discuss the details of Kelly's case.
isn't the mutilation, if fact, what you call a signature?
penny Hanley's name has captured the attention of not only the nation, but also the entire world.
this photo is the most recent image... - You hear that?
the whole world knows who you are.
we believe it was taken and sent by the person...
I'm so thirsty. I need water.
she never got that kind of attention.
they love you.
penny Hanley. The whole world knows your name.
I want to say something.
I want to say something to the sick son of a bitch that has my daughter.
Mr.Hanley, we all want to find your daughter. - Daddy.
but you really need to calm down. Let daddy talk.
come on, daddy, I want to hear what you have to say about this little girl.
Mr.Hanley, don't do this.
you know, I say something, she dies, I plead for her life, she dies.
I don't have any money, my wife passed away 2 years ago.
she is all I have, and if this sick bastard gets away with this
just let me say something.
Taylor Conwright, WVDC news.
Prentiss and Reid are moving north down M street.
what would you like to say to the man who has your daughter?
she's losing the room. Morgan's gotta do this now.
if the hill ripper is watching, what would you tell him?
I hope this works. - The M.E.Said
Kelly was killed only a half an hour before she was dumped.
that means he must have killed her in his car.
my little girl right now is in your hands.
that's right. That's right. She is in my hands.
and what did you do? Nothing.
maybe she's already with god.
either way, your life will be in my hands.
ladies and gentlemen, I have just received this...
he's going to find you.
...that the general public reduce their movements around M street, Georgetown, for the next few hours.
do you have a lead in the hill ripper case?
agent Garcia, do you have a lead in the ripper case?
no, we don't.
we have an address.
Rhett, what have you done to us now? Why can't you get anything right?
I got this, mom. I got this.
just don't answer the door, ok?
Rhett, please don't leave me. I can't be in this house alone.
I hate the dark. You know I hate the dark.
I love you, mom. Just go upstairs and turn out the lights and do not answer the door.
if he's moving, he's moving now.
slow down. There, in the alley.
Reid, where are you?
we're headed south down Jackson Street. There's hardly anything moving.
except cop cars. We've seen 5 in the last 10 minutes.
Hotch, if he's out here, he's got nowhere to go.
is no life at all.
back up.
No!
there's somebody in there.
No!
call an ambulance. Penny. Penny, it's ok.
you're gonna be all right.
Prentiss, Reid, unsub is headed south.
he just passed you.
there's an ambulance on its way.
penny, your dad's going to meet us at the hospital.
he got away, but you hit him.
we found traces of blood down the alley.
k-9 units are on the way.
we'll get him, though. I promise.
agent Hotchner. - Yes?
please don't leave me.
go ahead. We've got this.
thank you.
this car has a disabled permit.
registered to who?
may Walden. The unsub is Rhett Walden, her son.
Yeah, guys, we have an address. 1503 Hope street.
Oh, my gosh.
what?
the photo--it's exactly the same as Kelly and Penny.
when was it taken?
1956. it's a set photo from a movie called "Reflection of Desire.
may was 19 when this was taken.
she's got to be over 70 by now.
Yeah. M street, Rykers alley, they were all locations on this film.
it was the only movie she ever made, and...
she was 4 months pregnant when this picture was taken.
which ended her career. And the father?
co-star.
Derek, do you think she made her son do all of this?
Penelope,I think she made her son do a lot more than this.
rhett walden, this is the police!
we know you're in there. Come out with your hands up.
you hear that, mommy?
they're calling for us.
I told you this day would come. You didn't believe it, but here it is.
are you ready?
I'm ready, my sweet love.
this is the police.
we know you're in there. Come out with your hands up.
he's coming out.
what if all we have is all we were meant to be?
my love, oh, my love... To my grave I will carry you in my heart.
get down on the ground!
need a medic!
her lips.
they're Kelly's.
here.
Oh, what a gentleman.
excuse me, missy, but when did you plan on telling me?
Oh, I wasn't gonna tell you.
we all have things for ourselves. You know, you have property, I have the theater.
can you at least tell me what it's about?
it's about a woman who's attacked by a serial killer.
but she catches him and she knocks him out, and she keeps him for days.
Garcia, of all the plays in the world, you choose something like that?
I get to vent.
how does it end?
if I told you that, it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?
I believe humanity was born from conflict.
maybe that's why in all of us lives a dark side.
some of us embrace it.
some have no choice.
the rest of us fight it.
in the end, it's as natural as the air we breathe.
at some point, we're forced to face the truth.
ourselves.
I understand, Hotch.
take all the time you need.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll be fine.
OK. You, too.
I was hoping I could get a minute.
agent Seaver has requested her remedial training be here.
she was only cleared for one case.
that didn't end the way she had hoped.
I'd say.
she made a mistake.
but she remained calm under pressure.
she just wants to prove herself.
Hotch isn't here to supervise her.
I'll do it. I'll be her training agent.
he signed off?
via email. But I know you have a history with her.
don't make me regret this.
thank you.
ma'am. - Agent.
have you heard from Aaron?
he sounds like he hadn't slept.
do you think he's all right?
Jack's having some problems.
well, it's been a year since...
well, I'm glad he's finally taking some time off.
this is the only thing that's pending.
that was 20 years ago.
25, actually. He's up for parole.
they've asked us to do a risk assessment.
well, I can't do it, not with Aaron gone.
well, who can?
Morgan, can you come in here?
well, he's he's got to meet him today.
the parole board hearing is tomorrow.
now, what was his story?
junkies randomly attacked his family?
Yes, that's what he claimed.
he and his son survived.
frankly, I don't understand how parole is even a consideration.
well, he's eligible. They're overcrowded.
Yes, but the physical evidence was shocking.
who could possibly believe he would be innocent?
that's not our job.
all we need to see is how 25 years has changed his life.
ma'am.
is everything all right?
I need you to take a trip.
who's this?
he's been in petersburg half his life and he's up for parole.
it appears he's become a model prisoner.
you don't sound convinced.
I don't know how someone who kills his wife and daughter can be rehabilitated.
open 7.
on the gate.
SSA Derek Morgan.
BAU.
you analyze behavior.
close it.
nobody's ever believed that I'm innocent.
why would you?
may I? - Yeah.
I don't rely solely on physical evidence.
it says here that you were 2 years into your residency when all this happened.
what did you want to specialize in?
pediatrics.
you haven't requested parole in over 18 years.
the system put me in here. They're gonna keep me in here.
time's gone by a little faster since I accepted that.
has the heroin helped you pass the time?
they found it in your cell 2 years ago.
new regime had to assert power.
you're saying someone planted it.
Oh... It is what it is.
you hadn't been in solitary since you got here.
gave me a lot of time to think about my son.
your son's name is Joshua?
I'm sorry, I still don't understand how you're...
can ignore all that evidence.
the prosecution said that I had an acute psychological break, that I was a psychopath.
is that what you see?
psychopaths are masters at hiding what's inside of them.
is that what you think I've done?
agent, do you have any idea what it's like to be accused of something that you didn't do?
you went to the infirmary 16 times, and not once did you ever try to fight back.
no.
the last time they beat me, they...
well... I... I almost had it.
I mean, I didn't think that I was gonna make it.
and I was OK with that.
but I was lying there... And I had this, uh... Vision.
see, Joshua was, uh, was grown up.
the sun was shining on us.
I - I don't know where we were.
but I got to tell him that I didn't hurt our family.
and that's what's kept you going?
and then I just didn't want to feel sorry for myself.
I wanted-I wanted to- to live my life in here the way that I would have lived it out there and do things that I got cheated out of with Joshua.
is that why you've taught men how to read?
why you started a mentor program?
you've helped... 41 inmates get their G. E. D.
Mr. Sanderson, this is the type of evidence I consider.
if you were to gain your freedom... What would you do with it?
I can't even think about something like that.
but what would you do?
I would try and find my son...
and I'd tell him the truth.
based on physical evidence, Don Sanderson has been prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
but... The way in which he has spent the last 25 years...
it throws doubt on that conviction.
now, I know that is not the question at hand here today.
I have learned that behavior does not lie.
you all want to know whether or not this man has been reformed.
I believe that he has.
he's lost everything, yet somehow he has still managed to better himself.
more importantly to people around him, he's held on to the only good thing left in his life.
his son.
it's what defines him.
at this point, he's simply looking ahead.
therefore, it is my belief that Don Sanderson is not a danger to himself or to society.
I, uh, noticed you all drink double shots.
Oh, thanks. You do, too?
this is the first.
I wanted to thank you for having my back.
I hope you have mine.
front page news, eh?
morgan must not think he did it.
or believes he won't do it again.
is agent Morgan in?
what do you need, Erin?
metro p. d. Sent this an hour ago.
and they want us to take a look?
no, they want you to take a look.
who's this?
the man Don Sanderson just murdered.
there is no such thing as part freedom.
nelson Mandela.
why didn't Sanderson just run?
maybe he wanted to go back to prison.
there are plenty of ways to violate your parole other than homicide.
is Morgan OK?
he just vouched for a man that turned around and killed someone.
so he's the one let him out?
come on, Bill, you know it's never that simple.
Oh, you see this all the time, Rossi.
guy's out for a couple of days, he's gotta get back inside.
they why did he claim self-defense?
why call the paramedics?
why attempt cpr to keep him breathing?
why not just flee the scene?
he wanted something else.
like what? - I don't know yet.
well, he's predictable, if you ask me.
he broke into this guy's basement and stabbed him, same way he did his wife.
he's coming with us.
get out of the car.
let's go, move.
you're welcome to join us.
after I clean up here.
this is not a random act of violence. There has to be a reason.
anything could have been a weapon.
so he chose to stab him, just like he did before.
Hello, Tommy.
so he dialed 911, then he performed cpr.
why go through this big fight and then try and save him.
so the gun wasn't loaded, but he broke in, took it, and waited for Wittman to get home? Why?
I don't know, love, but I do know that your victim legally purchased that. 38 in '94, licensed to him.
other than that, no weapons, wives, or children.
the guy was pretty much a loner.
so there's gotta be some sort of connection.
there isn't any yet. I'm sorry. - All right. Thank you, Garcia.
Yeah, hey, how is my boy?
uh, fine. - Really?
no.
the bullets were in the other room, but the gun is right here.
maybe killing him was an accident?
does any of this strike you as hard to believe?
neighbors confirmed hearing sounds of a confrontation.
Yeah, but Sanderson was out of prison for what, reid?
at the time of the murder, 51 hours.
he's free for 2 days and change?
what's the big hurry to find this guy?
you woke up a free man and decided to kill Tom Wittman.
you gotta help us out here. It doesn't look good for you.
it wasn't supposed to be like that.
he came at me.
I get it that you don't trust anyone right now.
but this man is the reason that you're free.
did you find your son? - No.
did you even look?
drive.
how is he?
clearing his head.
Strauss is waiting for you guys to come back.
great. That's all he needs.
we still don't know how Tom Wittman is connected to Don Sanderson.
all we know about him is everything Morgan went over, what he was accused of.
and that he killed Tom Whitman this morning.
the guy's not talking.
he doesn't trust anybody.
if he doesn't tell us who Tom Wittman is, how are we going to help Derek?
the answer's in there somewhere.
we just have to find it.
all right, march 10, 1985, 2:23 a. m.
don Sanderson was asleep on his couch because of an argument he had with his wife.
he woke up to her screams.
he ran to the bedroom to find one man stabbing her, another man struck him from behind, knocking him unconscious.
his wounds were superficial in comparison, so it was easy for the prosecution to claim that Sanderson's wounds were self-inflicted.
and he had just finished his second year of residency at Georgetown, indicating he had the skills to do it to himself.
and his fingerprints were all over the weapon.
so, Sanderson comes to, his wife and daughter are dead.
almost dead.
he called for help.
sounds familiar.
he said that two men killed his wife, but when officers arrived, he changed his story.
he added a woman.
let me guess. They never found her.
no one ever looked.
so we have 3 people who commit a brutal double homicide, then never act on it again?
I don't know, it seems unlikely.
but nothing like that every happened after sanderson went to prison.
the question is, how does Tom Wittman play into this?
he was a teenager at the time.
I want everything from Tom Wittman's apartment.
it's on its way.
do you think Wittman was there that night?
that depends. - On what?
if you believe Sanderson's story.
my office will handle the press from here on.
that's unnecessary.
you don't need any more distractions.
he looks genuinely distraught.
he's very convincing.
I can see why you fell for it.
I don't need to remind you that your reputation's on the line here.
that's not what matters to me right now.
it should.
you played me.
I know how this looks.
Oh, do you?
Oh, well, please, enlighten me.
how does this look?
I didn't do it. - Yes, you did!
and now that's on me.
I bought into your holier than thou garbage!
I put a psychotic killer back out on the street, and in less than 51 hours you went right back to your old ways.
I didn't want to. - Then why did you?
because he would have killed me.
no. No. It's more than that.
it better be more than that.
why did you go to his house?
why would you risk your freedom to go after this man?
this is the rest of Tom Wittman's house.
